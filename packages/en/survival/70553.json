The yellow opera bag is still\r\nunfinished, so are the monogram handkerchiefs; these nuts must be picked\r\nfor the praulines, and Agnes and I have undertaken to set the children’s\r\ndoll house in order before the holidays. Rob and Jerry say we girls ought\r\nto begin to make our Christmas gifts on the 26th of December to be ready\r\nby next year.”\r\n\r\n“Hit ’pears to me, honey, you an’ Miss Agnes with yo’ needles and\r\npaintin’ has turned out nigh ’nough contraptions fur a county fair. Sakes\r\nalive! Miss Edith!” exclaimed Mammy Rose, glancing through the window\r\ninto the garden, “Look at dat big barr’l w’at Jeff’s a-bringin’ in!”\r\n\r\nThe kitchen door opened suddenly and the good-natured face and woolly\r\nhead of the yard man appeared inside for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Here’s a heap o’ apples or oranges w’at somebody’s done sont,” he\r\nannounced. “De ’spress man dumped ’em at de side do’. I ’spect dey’s a\r\npresent; he said thar wan’t nothin’ ter pay.”\r\n\r\n“O! They must be oranges or grapefruit for Mother from Florida. Uncle\r\nAlex always remembers us at Christmas time,” said Edith. “Roll them into\r\nthe store room and remove the head of the barrel!”\r\n\r\n“We sho’ air gwine ter hev’ some nice little puddin’s did Christmas\r\nef folks does say de orange crap’s a failure,” declared Mammy Rose,\r\nstanding with arms akimbo, her face brightening over the prospect of good\r\ncheer, then, in a stentorian voice she hailed the young negro who was\r\ndisappearing in the direction of the barn.\r\n\r\n“You Jeff! Stop dar! Wa’n’t dar a box or a package or somethin’ else lef’\r\nhere? Dar ought ’er been,” she said, assuming an air of mingled mystery\r\nand importance. “I was kind o’ ’spectin’ a ’spress package myse’f.”\r\n\r\n“You? An express package, Mammy Rose? From whom?” asked Edith, pausing in\r\nher work to scrutinize the picturesque and somewhat bent figure in the\r\nplaid gingham apron and bandanna head-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n“From dem lazy niggers up dar in Virginia, Lizzie and Callie. I’m gittin’\r\nmighty tired o’ deir onreliableness, always promisin’ an’ promisin’ ter\r\ndo things an’ neber doin’ ’em. ’Pears ter me like a little book learnin’s\r\ndone turned ’em plumb fools, but ef dey does flop dey se’ves ’round wid\r\ndey high edycation, de’s one word in the booktinary dey ain’t neber foun’\r\nde meanin’ ob; dey don’t know nothin’ ’tall ’bout gratichude. Ain’t\r\nI done had dat Lizzie and Callie down here, livin’ off o’ me a whole\r\nwinter, neber feelin’ sure fur cartain dat dey was my nieces, dey being\r\nyaller-brown like m’lasses candy an’ me as black as der pot hit’s made\r\nin? Ain’t I axed ’em ter come all unbeknownst ’case dey wrote dey was my\r\nsister Car’line’s orphan chil’un, an’ case dey come from Petersburg whar\r\nI come from when I was a little gal? Ain’ I sont ’em things an’ sont ’em\r\nthings Christmas after Christmas till I’se clean wo’ out? I b’lieves in\r\n’ciprocation, I does fur er fac’!”\r\n\r\nFor more than thirty years Mammy Rose had been a faithful employee in the\r\nRadcliffe family, and naturally everything that affected her happiness\r\nwas a matter of household concern. She had taken up her abode in the old\r\nColonial residence before any of the children were born, and, in point of\r\nfact, she was as much a fixture there as were the drawing-room mirrors or\r\nthe mahogany stairway. As an accomplished cook, Mammy Rose’s reputation\r\nhad spread far and wide till she had become the envy of every troubled\r\nhousekeeper in the vicinity. Strange to say, though she could prepare a\r\nhundred dainty dishes fit “to set before a king,” she couldn’t for the\r\nlife of her have given the exact recipe for a single one. When asked how\r\nshe made her famous Sally-lunn, corn-pudding, waffles or jelly cake, she\r\nwould look very wise and say, “You see, I cooks by ’sperience; I takes\r\na little ob dis, an’ a little of dat, an’ ef tain’t ’nough I takes some\r\nmo’.” But, perhaps, in the care of young children Mammy Rose was most\r\ntruly in her element. She loved them and “spoiled” them as if they were\r\nher own, and often, when tired of wrestling with the pots and kettles,\r\nshe would resort to the nursery for a fresh assignment of duty. Nothing\r\ndelighted her more than to play the role of fairy godmother to the little\r\nfolks.\r\n\r\nProvoked beyond her habitual good humor on this December afternoon by the\r\nneglect of her young kinswomen, Mammy Rose’s tirade was at its height\r\nwhen Mrs. Radcliffe stepped into the room to give an order. Upon hearing\r\nthe names Lizzie and Callie pronounced in strident, contemptuous tones,\r\nshe glanced significantly at Edith, suspicioning that the derelict nieces\r\nwere again at the bottom of the trouble.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t set my heart upon getting that box if I were you, Rosa,”\r\nsaid the mistress, when the matter had been explained. Judging from past\r\ndelinquencies that the girls’ promises were of the pie crust kind, she\r\nwished to soften the servant’s disappointment.\r\n\r\n“Now, see here, Mammy, Lizzie and Callie may not be totally ungrateful,\r\nbut perhaps they just won’t remember to send you a gift,” suggested\r\nEdith, offering the only consolation that came to mind.\r\n\r\n“Humph! won’t remember!” sniffed the old darky, with a fine show\r\nof scorn. “What is it de Scripture says about rememberin’—Thee, O,\r\nJerusalem, if my right hand be cut off? They can’t fergit dis time! I\r\ndone made Jeff write ter Lizzie and Callie mo’n a month ago tellin’ ’em\r\n’xactly w’at I’se ’spectin’!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you surely didn’t do that!” cried Edith, amused as well as shocked\r\nat the old woman’s candor.\r\n\r\n“Yes’um, I swar I did!” came the unwavering reply. “Thar’ ain’t no\r\nbeatin’ ’round de bush ’bout me; ef dey’s got a spark ob decency or\r\nse’f-respec’ dey’ll do w’at I tole ’em.”\r\n\r\n“What did you say you wanted?” asked Mrs. Radcliffe, whose curiosity had\r\nbecome thoroughly aroused.\r\n\r\n“I tole ’em ter sen’ me a bedquilt an’ I sent ’em a bushel o’ calico\r\nscraps ter he’p it ’long. Then I wanted a big jar of watermillon-rind\r\npickle, a gallon of peach preserves, an’ er sack full ob fresh goose\r\nfeathers. Last of all I axed fur er warm gray shawl. Ef dey had ter leabe\r\noff anything, I said let it be dat shawl, ca’se my ole one’s mighty nigh\r\ngood ’nough to w’ar to pra’r meetin’s an’ funerals.”\r\n\r\nDuring the days that intervened the conversation in the kitchen and\r\nthe Christmas festivities, Mammy Rose was constantly on the alert,\r\neach morning awakening with new hope and at night evincing great\r\ndisappointment as package after package arrived for old and young\r\nand nothing came for her. By the morning of the 24th, she had become\r\nextremely morose and ceased to take further interest in the holiday\r\npreparations. However, even in that state of mind she continued to hail\r\nevery express man, delivery man, and “A. D. T. boy” who came in sight,\r\ndemanding to know whether they had a package at the ’spress office for\r\nRose Wilkerson that they were “too triflin’ ter deliver.”\r\n\r\nBut, poor old soul, miserable as she was, she was by no means the only\r\nindividual who was dejected over the non-appearance of the presents from\r\nLizzie and Callie. Edith and Agnes were inclined to regard the matter\r\nvery seriously. In fact, after luncheon on Christmas Eve, they called a\r\nfamily council in the library, desiring that some action be taken in the\r\ncase. In spite of pressing engagements elsewhere, Mr. and Mrs. Radcliffe,\r\nGrandfather and Grandmother, Rob and Jerry, and Uncle Joe Echols were\r\npresent to lend a sympathetic ear to this vexed domestic problem.\r\n\r\nEdith as voluntary counsel for the faithful stewardess plead her cause\r\nfeelingly, eloquently, and with eminent success. Every member of that\r\naugust body agreed that Mammy Rose must receive her box before bedtime\r\non Christmas Eve, preferably by fair means, otherwise, by foul. If, upon\r\ninvestigation at the Southern office, there proved to be no package for\r\nher from those Virginia ingrates, why Old Santy himself must provide one.\r\nA very simple plan was put into operation. The men formed themselves into\r\na “ways and means” committee, authorizing the girls to draw upon them for\r\nthe necessary finances. Mrs. Radcliffe believed that she could purchase a\r\npretty calico quilt from the “Ladies’ Aid Society” of her church, and the\r\npickle and preserves could be procured from the Woman’s Exchange. Grandma\r\nthought she knew where a soft, warm shawl might be found and she put\r\non her bonnet and cloak to go and select it herself. In the bustle and\r\nstir of the fleeting afternoon, however, the sack of fresh goosefeathers\r\nloomed up as a staggering proposition.\r\n\r\n“Suppose we give her an eiderdown sofa pillow; she can rip it and take\r\nthe feathers out after Christmas if she wishes to make some other use of\r\nthem,” proposed Agnes.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s all right. We haven’t time to go poking around in poultry\r\nyards or to rip Grandma’s feather bed,” chimed in Rob.\r\n\r\n“Buy her a pair of flannel foot-warmers as a contribution from me,” said\r\nGrandpa Radcliffe. “I am aware how uncomfortable cold feet are in the\r\nwinter.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if you’ll have all of that—I was about to say plunder—up at my\r\noffice at five sharp, I’ll undertake to send it out in a transfer wagon\r\nby half-past six,” said Uncle Joe, thus solving the last difficulty.\r\n\r\nBy the time the family had assembled for the sumptuous Yule feast that\r\nevening, the depression of Mammy Rose’s mental status manifested itself\r\nin grumpy monosyllables. She was secretly lamenting the fact that she\r\nhad told anybody about her expectations. The other servants had been\r\nwhispering and snickering over her chagrin, or, she thought they had,\r\nwhile the white people from the children up seemed fairly bubbling over\r\nwith Christmas mirth. Apparently, every one had some particular reason\r\nfor rejoicing except herself. Thus far, this Christmas had been the most\r\n“disappintin’” one that she could remember.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later when the salad course was being served the cuckoo\r\nclock and the front door bell sounded in unison. Everyone seated around\r\nthe table gave an expectant start. Presently the man servant staggered\r\nin under the weight of a great wooden box that was directed to “Rose\r\nWilkerson, Care of Mr. Theodore Radcliffe, 456 Spruce Street, Memphis,\r\nTenn.” Mammy Rose bounded in through the back hall door the moment her\r\nname was pronounced. The thunder clouds had disappeared from her brow and\r\nher face was wreathed with smiles. “I know’d it, I know’d it all along!”\r\nshe declared. “My, but ain’t it heavy, an’ don’t h’it rattle. It’d be\r\njes like dem scatter-brained gals ter pack things so as ter get peach\r\npreserves all ober my bran’-new shawl.”\r\n\r\nA friendly audience followed the radiant old woman to the kitchen amid\r\nstifled laughter and concealed nudging and many pairs of eyes rested with\r\naffectionate interest upon her while she nervously assisted Jeff to draw\r\nout the nails. The first thing that met her gaze was the peach preserves;\r\nthree whole jars of it were lifted out in succession. “Land o’ Goshen!”\r\nshe exclaimed. “Ain’t I gwine ter hab a feast? They must o’ thought I was\r\ngwine ter set up a eatin-house—an’ a whole gallon o’ watermillon-rind\r\npickles. Ef dat don’t beat——”\r\n\r\nRob had extracted the gray shawl from the odd conglomeration in the box,\r\nand he laid it lightly over her shoulders. “Lor! Dis here gyarment sho’\r\nis warm an’ must er cost a heap o’ money. All dis comin’ on top o’ my\r\ngrumbling, too. ’Pears like wonders don’t neber stop ceasin’!” Next she\r\ndrew out the satin sofa cushion and for a half a minute she stared at it\r\nin blank amazement. For the first time vague misgivings as to where the\r\ngifts came from began to arise within her. “My—ee! Dis sho’ is pretty,\r\nan’ somebody had mighty good taste,” she ventured to say. She handled\r\nit very gingerly, however; according to her way of thinking it hardly\r\nseemed intended for her personal use and was far too perishable to adorn\r\na negro cabin.\r\n\r\n“Well, I guess Lizzie and Callie must hev struck the Louisiana Lott’ry,”\r\nshe declared, sighting the pink and white satin quilt. “Dis here spread\r\ncartin’ly is made after a handsome pattern, but I’ll be blest ef I knows\r\nhow dey done it out o’ dem mixed calico scraps. Jes ter think o’ dem\r\nyoung niggers puttin’ dey se’ves to all dis trouble fur de sake ob Mammy\r\nRose!”\r\n\r\nIn the midst of her jubilation the electric bell rang again; rang\r\nfuriously this time. A man at the door handed in a wooden box about two\r\nand a half feet square. It was for Mistress Rose Wilkerson and came from\r\nPetersburg, Virginia. Every confederate in the room gasped audibly.\r\nMammy Rose grasped the end of the table to steady herself. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nRadcliffe exchanged uneasy glances, Grandma Radcliffe turned very white\r\nand sat down suddenly, and a sepulchral silence reigned broken only by\r\nthe sound of the hatchet in Jerry’s deft hand. To the darkies assembled\r\nin the background there was something “spookey” about the square parcel;\r\nthey wouldn’t have touched it for worlds. Edith was the first person\r\nto whom the humorous side of the situation presented itself. Stepping\r\nforward with commendable presence of mind, she tore away the brown\r\nbutcher’s paper that concealed the contents of the second box. A small\r\ngray plaid shoulder shawl fell out upon the floor; a card was attached to\r\nit bearing these words: “To Aunt Rose from her deserving nieces Lizzie\r\nand Callie Goode.”\r\n\r\nSimultaneously both women dived into the melange of queer treasures and\r\nbrought forth a little China vase that was decidedly “niggery” (no other\r\nword could adequately describe it), a small jar of peach marmalade, and a\r\nsack of loose goose feathers. That last article broke the spell. Further\r\neffort at maintaining the deception was useless—the plot was out. Mammy\r\nRose, no longer mystified, but on the verge of hysterics over the honors\r\ndone her, essayed to express her gratitude: “Well, if you all ain’t de\r\nbeatin’est white folks an’ ef I ain’t de discomboberatedest critter\r\ndat ever——!” Choking with emotion, she raised her brimming eyes to her\r\nbenefactors to find herself—alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Air and the Water\r\n\r\nBy WM. DENISON, FARGO, N. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The air and the water contain all the invisible essences of things, that\r\nfrom which all plants and minerals arise, and of which they are, so to\r\nspeak, only condensations or precipitations, so that they become manifest\r\nto our crude senses.” Assuming that the above idea is the truth, and we\r\nfully believe it is, then the air and the water of this earth certainly\r\nmust play a most important role in the weal or woe of all things\r\nterrestrial, whether animate or inanimate.\r\n\r\nCorroborating the above idea, at least the air part of it, which is true,\r\nbeing of such paramount importance was advanced four or five years ago\r\nat a meeting of the National Convention of Chemists, at Washington, D.\r\nC. But they failed to recognize that the water was equally as important.\r\nHowever, some wonderful things were said at that meeting of chemists,\r\namong others, that for a long time past suggestions had been thrown out\r\nto the effect that the exhaustion of the soil would inevitably wipe out\r\nthe human race; or at least reduce it greatly in numbers before many\r\nhundred years. But these scientists announced a new discovery, which put\r\nanother face on the problem. They declared that this country alone was\r\nable to support In comfort 500 million people—a number equal to nearly\r\none-third the world’s population at that time. Thanks for this discovery.\r\nThe land, while producing greater amounts of foods, is to become steadily\r\nricher and more fertile. This great discovery of these chemists at\r\nthe national convention, is that it is atmosphere, and not the soil,\r\nmainly, that produces the crops. Take all the hay or wheat or corn that\r\nis yielded on an acre of land and burn it, stalks and all. It will all\r\ndisappear save about two per cent of the total weight. This two per cent\r\nof ash represents what the soil has furnished in the shape of mineral\r\nmatter. The farmer of the future must look above for his nitrogen. Aye,\r\nand also look below for his moisture. With the aid of this new knowledge\r\nthe present wheat growing regions can be multiplied by three. Today ten\r\naverage acres planted to wheat produce 150 bushels of cereal. With very\r\nlittle trouble and slight cost those average ten acres can be made to\r\nyield 400 bushels. This is simply a question of increasing the average\r\nyield from thirteen to about forty bushels.\r\n\r\nA good many acres of new land in the Northwest produce forty bushels\r\nof wheat at a crop. They do it because the land contains the requisite\r\nquantities of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash. Supply those\r\nmaterials to other acres in proper amounts and with climatic conditions\r\nnot unfavorable their yield will be as great.\r\n\r\nAccording to these chemists this is the keynote of the whole business.\r\nThey say it is no longer accepted as a fact that a non-fertile field is\r\nuseless. On the contrary, it is known that such a field merely needs\r\nto be supplied with the proper elements, cheaply obtained, in order\r\nto produce richly. Suppose a farmer has such a field, and that he has\r\nintelligence enough to take advantage of the new knowledge. He goes to\r\na chemist and has a sample of the soil analyzed. One, perhaps more, of\r\nthree things is certainly the matter with it. It lacks potash, it does\r\nnot contain sufficient phosphoric acid or there is an undue absence of\r\nnitrogen. Just for argument’s sake, suppose that there is enough potash\r\nand phosphoric acid—the two mineral earth elements essential to the\r\nmake-up of plant life, but that nitrogen is lacking. The chemist, in\r\nthat case, tells the farmer that he must put his field into condition\r\nto absorb the nitrogen from the air. This is extremely simple, and this\r\nis all there is about it. All the farmer has to do if his soil is\r\ndeficient in nitrogen is to plant a legume (of which there are 6,500\r\nspecies scattered over this earth of ours) suitable to his section of\r\ncountry. The cowpea is best adapted for the South, and beans and red\r\nclover for the North, or any other leguminous plants suited to his\r\nlocality. These plants have an affinity for nitrogen, and they drink it\r\nfrom the atmosphere as a baby takes milk from a bottle. The most costly\r\nand indispensable of all plant foods is nitrogen. Yet there is plenty of\r\nit at hand, inasmuch as that substance composes eighty per cent of the\r\natmosphere. The only trouble is to get it out of the air and into the\r\nsoil, but there is no real difficulty about that.\r\n\r\nStrange, is it not, readers, that the costliest, most expensive plant\r\nfood—nitrogen—heretofore, to every farmer, is so abundantly supplied by\r\nan all-wise Creator.\r\n\r\nWe have been advocating through the press this knowledge for the past\r\ntwelve years, which these scientists call new. But we regret that in\r\ntheir deliberation they did not give due consideration, in fact, not any\r\nat all, of the equal importance to the water end of this article.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will refer to the account of the creation in the first\r\nchapter of Genesis, seventh verse, he will see that the Creator’s second\r\nday’s work was dividing the waters of the atmosphere and the waters of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThis preceded the third day of creation, when vegetation began, which\r\nshows conclusively that the waters were equally as important as the air.\r\nIt is obvious, then, that this covering of the earth’s surface with\r\nvegetation was for a wise purpose, that of conserving the moistures\r\nof the earth without which there can be no successful crops raised.\r\nIt is evident that our climate is changing in this country. Ten years\r\nago a writer of Chicago, now deceased, gave a theory for the cause of\r\nour changing climate, which I indorse. “The cutting down of our virgin\r\nforests, which has been going on at a fearful rate for the past sixty\r\nyears, and also the breaking up and putting under cultivation so large\r\nan area of prairie land in so short a time, is the direct cause. The\r\nequilibrium between the moisture of the atmosphere and the moisture of\r\nthe earth is maintained by the virgin forests of a country, and when the\r\nvirgin forests are slaughtered, as they have been in this country by\r\nthe lumber kings, that equilibrium is lost. Then comes drouth, fires,\r\nfamines, pestilence and death.”\r\n\r\nThis theory is borne out in the fact that there always is so much\r\nhumidity in the atmosphere during a protracted drouth. The histories of\r\nthe ancient and modern civilizations also bear out this theory. There is\r\nno doubt but that the ancient civilizations had immense virgin forests to\r\nbegin with, and that as soon as these virgin forests were consumed, then\r\nthe equilibrium between the moisture of the atmosphere and the moisture\r\nof the earth were destroyed and one after the other of these great\r\nnations have perished by drouth, famines, fires and pestilences. I cannot\r\nrecall to mind ever having seen a natural spring of water on a treeless\r\nprairie. It is in the timber we find them, showing conclusively that the\r\nforests of a country make the great reservoir of its water supply.\r\n\r\nTo come down to modern civilizations, a pertinent comment is that made by\r\nMr. Charles F. Adams on one of the causes that have led to the downfall\r\nof Spain. It is a fact that this peninsula once supported a population\r\nof about 45,000,000, but now holds a meager 17,000,000. The main reason\r\nfor this is stated by Mr. Adams. “During the last three years I have\r\nspent much time in Europe, visiting among other countries Spain, Italy,\r\nGermany, France and England, and whoever wishes to study the effects\r\nof deforesting on a country and on its people should by all means visit\r\nSpain. Not only has the country been ruined, but the character of the\r\npeople has been changed by the wholesale destruction of trees, and the\r\nneglect of their renewal. The rivers have become mountain torrents and a\r\nlarge portion of the country is a rugged upland desert. The same process\r\nis to-day going on in Italy. The results in that country as noticed by me\r\nin visits ten years apart is lamentable. The ancient forests are being\r\nwholly stripped from the mountains, and while the rivers are converted\r\ninto torrents, the water is not held in the soil. In Germany, on the\r\nother hand, the forestry laws are admirable. The result upon the country,\r\nclimate and rainfall is apparent to the most careless observer.\r\n\r\n“It is certainly timely to urge the United States that it shall not\r\npermit itself to copy the Spanish example of decay in this or any other\r\nrespect.”\r\n\r\nThe facts stated by Mr. Adams have been corroborated again and again,\r\nto the effect that the denudation of the mountain slopes of Spain and\r\nthe erosion of its soil have reduced it to a condition of semi-aridity\r\nand lessening its power to support population, one-third of which are\r\nto-day indulging in bread riots. Of all the civilized nations, we most\r\nnearly copy the Spanish stupidity in the waste of our forests. We should\r\ncertainly set about showing ourselves to be wiser than the nation whose\r\ndecay is now so evident.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistoric Highways of the South\r\n\r\nPart I. St. John’s Church, Ashwood, Tennessee.\r\n\r\nBY JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn “The Banner of the Cross,” a Philadelphia paper, a writer, whose name\r\nis unknown, wrote, in 1842, the first description of the now famous\r\nchapel, St. John’s Church, on the pike leading from Columbia, Tenn., to\r\nMt. Pleasant.\r\n\r\n“It was my privilege,” says the writer, “in the month of January, 1834,\r\nto listen to the details of the progress of the Church in Tennessee\r\nfrom the lips of Bishop Otey, who had just been consecrated. I did not\r\nthink then that in God’s providence I should ever witness in person the\r\nresults of the Bishop’s labors in the then far-off country. But yesterday\r\n(September 4, 1842), which was a bright, beautiful Sabbath, I witnessed\r\na scene gladdening to a church-man’s heart, and knowing your interest in\r\nall that concerns the Church in the Southwest, I have thought a sketch of\r\nit might be interesting.\r\n\r\n“In this country, upon the road leading from Columbia to Mt. Pleasant,\r\nand about six miles from the former place, in a grove of majestic\r\nand towering oaks, may be seen a neat brick church of simple Gothic\r\narchitecture; its interior plain and appropriate and capable of seating\r\nfive hundred persons.\r\n\r\n“It has been just completed and is the result of the joint liberality\r\nof Bishop Polk and three of his brothers, who, with a spirit worthy of\r\ncommendation and imitation, have devoted a portion of the wealth with\r\nwhich God has blessed them to his service.\r\n\r\n“Without aid from abroad, these gentlemen have erected and paid for\r\nthis edifice and presented it, together with a plot of about six acres\r\nof land, to the diocese. The lot has been selected from an eligible\r\nportion of the bishop’s plantation, within a few hundred yards of whose\r\nmansion the church stands. It has been erected for the convenience of\r\nthe few families in the neighborhood who, with a large number of negroes\r\non their plantations, will make quite a congregation. For the latter\r\nclass the bishop has been in the habit, for a long time, of holding\r\nregular services in his own house. They will now have an opportunity of\r\nworshiping in a temple which they may almost call their own.”\r\n\r\nAfter referring to the services in the church on the day of its\r\nconsecration, the writer continues:\r\n\r\n“There is yet one thing which I must not forget to notice. I have said\r\nthat on the adjoining plantations there are negroes for whose spiritual\r\ngood this church was in part erected. By the time the white congregation\r\nwas seated in the body of the church, the door, the vestibule, the\r\ngallery and staircase were crowded with blacks. Even the vestry room was\r\nfilled with them, an old man sitting within the doorway, almost at the\r\nvery feet of the clergy. A happier group I have seldom seen. Some of\r\nthem had prayer books in their hands, but, for their general benefit in\r\nsinging, the psalms were given out in the old-fashioned way—two lines at\r\na time—and, I am sure, during the singing the loudest psalms of praise\r\ncame from the sable groups.\r\n\r\n“When the whites had commenced, a cordial invitation from the bishop\r\nwas given to the blacks to come forward. At the same time he explained\r\nin a few words what was required of them in worthily partaking of that\r\nsacrament.\r\n\r\n“Then quite a great number came, with much reverence and devotion, to\r\nthat feast precious alike to bond and free. Ah! could some of our friends\r\nhave witnessed that scene, how it would have silenced a suspicion that\r\na slaveholder values not the soul of his slave. Thus does the enlarged\r\nbenevolence of these men embrace a class hitherto too much neglected, a\r\nclass which, in our good city of brotherly love, are suffered to grovel\r\nin ignorance, degradation and sin:\r\n\r\n“Here will they learn to worship God in spirit and in truth; here be\r\ntaught to pray with the heart and with the understanding also; and here,\r\nwhen death has arrested their course upon earth, will they find a\r\nresting place under the tall old oaks in their own churchyard; for the\r\nlot upon which the church is built has, for some time, been set apart for\r\nthe purpose.”\r\n\r\nAs intimated above, the church was built by the then bishop, after\r\nGen. Leonidas Polk and his brothers, upon their own estate, for the\r\naccommodation of the communicants around them and their slaves. The\r\ndescription above presents a feature of slavery which was common\r\nthroughout the South, and shows how zealously the master looked after the\r\nspiritual welfare of his slaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View of St. John’s from the Pike.]\r\n\r\nThe Polk family—not the President, James K. Polk—who lived in Columbia,\r\nsix miles away, and was a relative of the Ashwood Polks, but the Polks\r\nat Ashwood—lived in true baronial style. The most distinguished of that\r\nfamily was Bishop Leonidas Polk, who, while bishop, was the moving\r\nspirit in the erection of the chapel, copying after the rural chapels\r\nof England. Leonidas Polk was educated at West Point for a soldier, and\r\ngraduated in 1827, but so strong was the other side of his character that\r\nhe resigned his commission in the army and entered the ministry. This was\r\na sore disappointment to his father, the old Revolutionary soldier, Col.\r\nWm. Polk, causing him to write to his son that the step was the spoiling\r\nof a good soldier for a poor preacher.\r\n\r\nBut the old gentleman, who himself had joined Washington’s army at the\r\nage of eighteen years and had fought all through the Revolutionary War,\r\nbeing thrice wounded and gaining the title of Colonel and the reputation\r\nof being one of the ablest soldiers of his day, was greatly mistaken\r\nin this choice of his soldier-preacher son. Not only did Leonidas Polk\r\nbecome one of the great pioneer preachers of his day, but, as Dr. Wm. M.\r\nPolk says in his biography of him: “It might have touched the feelings\r\nof the veteran if he could have known that Leonidas would one day buckle\r\non the sword—that he would lead more men in the field than his father had\r\never seen arrayed in battle, and that he would die at last a soldier’s\r\ndeath in the field of honor, fighting for what he deemed to be the cause\r\nof right and liberty.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Col. Wm. Polk, the same historian tells this amusing incident\r\nof the old soldier:\r\n\r\n“When Lafayette returned to America in 1824 and made his memorable tour\r\nthrough the States, Colonel Polk was one of the commissioners appointed\r\nto do the honors of the State of North Carolina to his old comrades in\r\narms.\r\n\r\n“An eye-witness has left an amusing account of some incidents of the\r\nreception of Lafayette on his passage through North Carolina. Col.\r\nWilliam Polk has been requested by Governor Burton to provide a cavalry\r\nescort for the illustrious visitor, and a troop of excellently drilled\r\nand handsomely uniformed volunteers was formed from the Militia of\r\nMecklenburg and Cabarrus escort, under command of General Daniel, and\r\nmet Lafayette near the Virginia line. There was much hand-shaking and\r\nspeech-making.”\r\n\r\n“But,” as the narrator writes, “Lafayette spoke but little English and\r\nunderstood less. He had retained a few phrases, which he would utter,\r\ngenerally in an effective manner, but sometimes ludicrously mal a propos.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, my dear friend! Great country! Happy man! Ah, I remember!” were\r\nnearly his whole vocabulary. He was received at the borders of each State\r\nby appointed commissioners, and when he had been escorted through it\r\nhe was safely delivered to the commissioners of the next commonwealth.\r\nAt Halifax the cortege was met by General Daniel, who had stationed a\r\ncompany of soldiers by the roadside, flanked by the ladies, who were\r\nassembled to do honor to the guest of the State. It had been arranged\r\nthat the ladies were to wave their handkerchiefs as soon as Lafayette\r\ncame into sight, and when General Daniel exclaimed “Welcome, Lafayette!”\r\nthe whole company was to repeat the welcome after him. Unluckily, the\r\nladies, misunderstanding the programme, waited too long, and were\r\nreminded of their duty by a stentorian command of, “Flirt, ladies, flirt!\r\nflirt, I say!” from the general, who walked down the line to meet the\r\nMarquis. Equally misunderstanding their part, the soldiers, instead of\r\nshouting, “Welcome, Lafayette,” in unison at the close of the general’s\r\naddress, repeated the sentence, one by one, and in varying tones.\r\n\r\n“Now a deep voice would exclaim: ‘Welcome, Lafayette!’ then perhaps the\r\nnext man in a shrill tenor would squeak: ‘Welcome, Lafayette!’ and so\r\non down the line. Daniel, frantic at the burlesque of his order, vainly\r\nattempted to correct it, but as he unfortunately stammered when he was\r\nexcited, his ‘Say it all to-to-together!’ could not overtake the running\r\nfire of ‘Welcome, Lafayette!’ which continued all along the line. ‘Great\r\ncountry! Great country!’ replied Lafayette, turning to Colonel Polk,\r\nwho was vainly trying not to smile. Observing and recognizing an old\r\nacquaintance, Lafayette greeted him with great effusion: ‘Ah, my friend;\r\nso glad to see you once more! Have you prospered and had good fortune\r\nthese years?”\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, General, yes; but I have had the great misfortune to lose my wife\r\nsince I saw you.’\r\n\r\n“Catching only the ‘Yes, General,’ and the word ‘wife,’ Lafayette\r\nsupposed he was informing him of his marriage, and patting him\r\naffectionately upon the shoulder, he exclaimed: ‘Happy man! Happy man!’\r\nnor could be made to understand that his observation was not a happy one.\r\n\r\n“After replying to the address of welcome, which had been delivered by\r\nColonel Polk from the steps of the Capitol, Lafayette, with all the\r\ndramatic action of a Frenchman, turned to Polk and before the old soldier\r\nknew what he was about, threw his arms about his neck and attempted to\r\nkiss him on the cheek. Colonel Polk straightened himself up to his full\r\nheight of six feet four, and instinctively threw his head back to escape\r\nthe caress; but Lafayette, who was a dapper little fellow, tiptoed and\r\nhung on to the grim giant, while a shout of laughter burst from the\r\nspectators and was with some difficulty turned into a cheer.\r\n\r\n“Of Col. William Polk’s influence in the State of Tennessee, Governor\r\nSwain, of North Carolina, has said: ‘He was the contemporary and personal\r\nfriend and associate of Andrew Jackson, not less heroic in war and quite\r\nas sagacious and more successful in private life.”\r\n\r\n“It is known that Colonel Polk greatly advanced the interests and\r\nenhanced the wealth of the hero of New Orleans by information furnished\r\nhim from his field notes as a surveyor, and in directing Jackson in his\r\nselections of valuable tracts of land in the State of Tennessee; that to\r\nSamuel Polk, the father of the President, he gave the agency of renting\r\nthe most fertile section of that State; and selling his (William Polk’s)\r\nimmense and valuable estate in lands in that, as first President of the\r\nBank of North Carolina, he made Jacob Johnson, the father of President\r\nAndrew Johnson, its first porter, so that of the three native North\r\nCarolinians who entered the White House through the gates of Tennessee\r\nall are alike indebted for benefactions and for promotions to a more\r\nfavorable position in life to the same individual, William Polk—a man\r\nwhose insight into character rarely admitted of the selection and never\r\nof the retention of an unworthy agent.”\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the war, Leonidas Polk was appointed Major General by\r\nJefferson Davis and became one of the great generals of the Confederacy.\r\nHe was killed by a cannon ball, on Pine Mountain, near Marietta, Ga.,\r\nJune 14, 1864.\r\n\r\nContinuing the subject of the slave-owners’ interest in the spiritual\r\nwelfare of his slaves, Miss Beauchamp, who was governess in Bishop Polk’s\r\nfamily, tells this amusing story:\r\n\r\n“The Bishop, who would at times be away for weeks on visitations through\r\nhis diocese, always brought on his return joy and pleasure to the\r\nhousehold. He would amuse us for days with a recital of his adventures in\r\nthe border regions of Louisiana and with the people he would meet there.\r\nOn one occasion, having been up Red River, where an Episcopal clergyman\r\nwas seldom seen, he was called in to baptize a sturdy, four-year-old\r\nyoungster, who defiantly resisted sacrament unless his black Fidus\r\nAchates, Jim, would receive it at the same time. ‘Well,’ said the Bishop,\r\n‘bring in Jim and I will make a Christian of him, too.’ Accordingly,\r\nJim, being instructed by his mistress, was brought into the parlor; the\r\npair went through the ceremony with perfect propriety and were dismissed\r\nto their play. Meanwhile, the friends and neighbors who had called to\r\nassist at the baptism and pay their respects to the Bishop, sat in solemn\r\nstate, awaiting the announcement of dinner. Smallpox had been lurking\r\nin the country. Every one was excited on the subject of vaccination,\r\nand discussions as to whether it had taken on this or that subject had\r\nbeen the order of the day for more than a week. Suddenly the circle was\r\nastounded by the reappearance of Jim, who exclaimed, almost breathless\r\nwith excitement: ‘Mistes! mistes! you must have Marse Tom baptized over\r\nag’in; it never tuck that ar time. He’s out yonder cussin’ the steers\r\nwusser’n ever, and says he ain’t gwinter stop for nobody.’ The ice melted\r\nat once, and the stiffness of the circle vanished as the Bishop turned\r\nto his hostess and said: ‘A commentary on the doctrine of baptismal\r\nregeneration, my dear madam.’\r\n\r\n“Every Sunday afternoon all the negroes on the plantation came up to\r\nthe house and were taught by Mrs. Polk, her daughters and myself in\r\ndifferent classes. Singing entered largely into the exercises, many of\r\nthe negroes having a taste for music, and some of them excellent voices.\r\nThe ceremonies of marriage and baptism were always performed by the\r\nBishop himself and the names chosen by the negroes were sometimes very\r\namusing. Many of them could not read, and they showed their appreciation\r\nof Greek mythology and Shakespeare by the number of Minervas and Ophelias\r\namong them. One Sunday twenty-five little negro infants were taken into\r\nthe Bishop’s arms and christened. Though the scene was a very impressive\r\nand interesting one, yet some of the names were so droll to my ears that\r\nI could scarcely preserve a becoming gravity. One was named ‘Crystal\r\nPalace,’ another, ‘Vanity Fair,’ etc. But when a little creature, black\r\nas Erebus and squalling with its mouth extending to enormous size,\r\nwas taken into the Bishop’s arms to be named ‘Prince Albert’ it was\r\nimpossible for me to resist longer, and a heavy fit of coughing, gotten\r\nup for the occasion, saved me from a reproving look from the Bishop.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Cemetery at St. John’s, Where Generals Cleburne,\r\nStrahl and Granbury Were Buried.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful and touching scenes is quoted further from the\r\nsame book, and related by the Bishop’s wife, on page 176.\r\n\r\nAfter describing the visitation of cholera in the winter of 1849-50, and\r\nthe Bishop’s almost fatal illness from it, together with almost all his\r\nfamily and the death of nearly a hundred of the servants of himself and\r\nfriends, Mrs. Polk relates this touching incident:\r\n\r\n“As soon as the Bishop was able—indeed, at the risk of a relapse—he\r\nwas at the bedside of the sick and the dying. The last case of cholera\r\noccurred on the 7th of June, when a very fine servant, named Wright, by\r\ntrade a blacksmith, was attacked. His master had been reading and praying\r\nwith him. Wright raised his head and said: ‘Master, lift me up.’ ‘I am\r\nafraid to, Wright,’ the Bishop said—‘the doctors say it might be fatal.’\r\n‘I am dying now, master; lift me up.’ The Bishop raised him, when Wright\r\nsuddenly threw his arms around his master’s neck and exclaimed: ‘Now,\r\nmaster, I can die in peace; I do love you so I have often wanted to hug\r\nyou, and now let me die resting here on your heart and you praying for\r\nme!’ His wish was complied with and soon he was at rest.”\r\n\r\nSt. John’s Church received its most sacred and consecrated fame during\r\nthe war. When Hood’s army invaded Tennessee after the fight around\r\nAtlanta, in November, 1864, the route of the army lay along this pike in\r\nthe march to Nashville. The army had been marching over the poor lands of\r\nthe barrens, the hills of Georgia and the barrens of the Highland Run,\r\nand when it entered Middle Tennessee, in the garden spot of which sat\r\nthis little church, Gen. Patrick R. Cleburne, who had won great fame as\r\na dashing fighter, raised his hat to the restful beauty and quietness of\r\nSt. John’s and remarked: “If I am killed in the coming battle, I would\r\nlike to be buried yonder.” In a few days occurred the bloody battle\r\nof Franklin, in which not only Cleburne, but Generals Gist, Strahl,\r\nGranbury and Adams—five of the greatest field officers of Hood’s army,\r\nwere killed, and all except Generals Adams and Gist, were buried in the\r\nbeautiful cemetery at St. John’s. Years afterward, one by one, their\r\nremains were exhumed and carried, with fitting honors, to their former\r\nhomes, where monuments had been erected to their memories. General Adams\r\nwas killed on the breastworks, his horse falling half over, and he\r\nhimself over in the enemy’s lines supported and soothed by one of the\r\nofficers who mourned the mortal wound, saying that he was too brave a man\r\nto die. Cleburne fell leading his men up to the breastworks.\r\n\r\nThe communion silver for St. John’s was given by Mrs. Sarah H. Polk, the\r\nwidow of the old Revolutionary soldier, and the mother of Gen. Leonidas\r\nPolk. It was beautiful and massive. The war left St. John’s desolate, the\r\nFederal army burned the beautiful and imposing mansion of the fighting\r\nbishop, the communicants were scattered and for nearly half a century\r\nthe picturesque chapel has, with occasional services in it, alone stood\r\nsilent sentinel over its great dead a monument of an heroic age.\r\n\r\nThe account of how the communion silver was saved during the war is a\r\nstory told by one of the ladies of the Polk family, and so generally\r\ninteresting that it is related here, as it illustrates so perfectly the\r\npeculiar superstitious nature of the negro:\r\n\r\nOne of the most faithful negroes belonging to Col. Geo. W. Polk was a\r\nnegro named Wiley, who had been in the family as a trusty and faithful\r\nservant for so many years that Colonel Polk thought he could trust his\r\nlife in Wiley’s hands. Another negro was old John, a very old negro,\r\nwho was gardener, and too old to do much more than keep up the flower\r\ngarden and the walks of the estate. Word was brought to Colonel Polk\r\nthat some Federals stationed in Columbia, six miles away, intended to\r\nmake a midnight raid on St. John’s and secure the silver service at the\r\nchurch. Perhaps it was Wiley himself who brought the information, and\r\nthat the raid, or rather the theft, would occur that night. It did not\r\ntake Colonel Polk long to act. Soon after dark, taking Wiley and a small\r\nexpress, he went to the old church and secured the silver. Silently he\r\nand the negro went out in the dark carrying the silver in a large cedar\r\nbox and taking off the top of one of the old square box-tombs, he hid it\r\nthere and placed the top slab back in its place.\r\n\r\nTrusting Wiley implicitly, he did not believe the silver would ever be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed, and Colonel Polk felt that all was secure. But one\r\nmorning as he walked early in the garden he saw old John, the gardener,\r\nlooking at him furtively and in a peculiar way. Wiley was also around,\r\nand the old negro showed plainly that he wished to say something to his\r\nmaster that he did not wish Wiley to hear. Knowing the negro nature as he\r\ndid—that they never came out openly and said what they thought—and that\r\nthe furtive glances which old John gave him now and then meant more than\r\nwords, the Colonel waited until Wiley had left, and purposely entered\r\ninto conversation with the old negro. He did not want to flush his game,\r\nas he would have done by a direct question, so he patiently waited until\r\nthe old negro should speak in his own way, for he knew that the old negro\r\nhas something important to tell him in his own negro way.\r\n\r\n“Marster,” said the old man at last, “I had sich a quare dream las’\r\nnight, I thort I’d tell you, and maybe you could ’terprit it for de ole\r\nman. It’s hung onto me all day an’ pestered me so I can’t wuck, an’ I\r\ncan’t do nothin’ till I tells you. I feels sho’ it means old John is\r\ngwineter go soon, fur I seed two angels as plain as I ever seed anybody,\r\nbut I can’t jes zackly understan’ it all, an’ I thort maybe ef I’d tell\r\nyou, you mout he’p me.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, John,” said the Colonel; “I shall be glad to help you interpret\r\nthe dream.”\r\n\r\n“Wall, Marse George, I dreamed I wuz down at the ole church a wanderin’\r\namong the tombs, out in the ole part, among the trees. An’ den I kinder\r\nfell into a trance, an’ den I heard a voice say: ‘John, git up an’ come\r\nwid me.’ I riz an’ looked, an’ I see a pale light shinin’ from de church\r\nwinder, an’ bimeby I seed, two angels come out uv de church. One wuz er\r\nwhite angel an’ one wuz er black angel, an’ dey carried de corpse of er\r\nleetle chile in dey arms. Dey come out de church an’ put de coffin in er\r\nwaggin an’ den dey move off solem. I foller de sperits, an’ dey carried\r\nde corpse of dat leetle chile to er ole tomb an’ tuck offen de top an\r\ndey put de leetle dead chile in de ole tomb an’ den dey vanished. It\r\nseem lak a long time went by—mebbe two nights—an’ den I seed, way in de\r\nnight, ’twix’ midnight an’ day, other sperits ride inter de ole church\r\nyard—soldier sperits, mounted on steeds—an’ dey rid up to de tomb an’\r\nbroke it open an’ tuck de corpse of de leetle chile an’ went away. Now,\r\nMarse George, dat’s pesterin’ me mighty. Whut dem soldier sperits wanter\r\npester de body uv dat leetle chile fur?”\r\n\r\nThe Colonel saw at once the application of the dream, and that it was\r\nthe negro way of warning him without letting Wiley know that the warning\r\nhad ever been given. He reassured the old darky, who walked off to his\r\nwork satisfied. That night Colonel Polk went alone to the old tomb and\r\ntook out the silver, burying it in his garden. About midnight, Wiley led\r\nthe Federals to the tomb, only to find the silver gone. But Wiley never\r\ncame home again. Knowing that his secret was out, he ran off with the\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nFor many years, as remarked above, St. John’s held the remains of\r\nGenerals Cleburne, Strahl and Granbury, three of the five generals who\r\nfell around the breastworks of Franklin. But one by one, as the years\r\nwent by, the remains of these brave men were removed and carried to\r\ntheir native States—Cleburne to Arkansas, Granbury to Texas—and finally,\r\nafter nearly forty years of rest among the trees and under the beautiful\r\nbluegrass of St. John’s the gallant young soldier, Strahl, was taken\r\nto his old home in West Tennessee. Above them all, the people of their\r\nnative soil have erected suitable monuments.\r\n\r\nOnly a few years ago were the ashes of Strahl removed. A brave, handsome\r\nyoung fellow he had been, daring as a soldier and true and self-poised,\r\none of the recognized great soldiers of Hood’s ill-fated army. He led\r\nhis men up to the side of the Federal entrenchments and down in the\r\ntrenches. With those who had not been killed or wounded, he stood, and\r\n“keep firing” was the word he passed up and down the thin line, hugging\r\none side of the breastwork while their enemies held the other, not six\r\nfeet away. Mr. Cunningham, editor of The Confederate Veteran, who stood\r\nnear the general, tells it: “The trench was filled with the dead and the\r\ndying. Standing with one foot on the bodies of my comrades and the other\r\non the bank, I rested my rifle upon the top of the breastwork and kept\r\nfiring at the enemy on the other side. The line had been so thinned that\r\nonly a solitary fellow soldier stood near me, and now he was shot and\r\nfell heavily against me and tumbled over in the mass of dead men. This\r\nleft me alone, and I asked General Strahl, who had stood for a long while\r\nin the trenches and passed up loaded guns to men above: ‘What shall I do,\r\nGeneral?’ ‘Keep firing,’ came back, and almost with the word the general\r\nhimself was shot, and while being carried to the rear was struck again\r\nand instantly killed.”\r\n\r\nThis was the brave young soldier who had lain for nearly forty years in\r\nhis grave, and whom we were going to disinter and send back his ashes\r\nto his old home. It was a raw March day, some three years ago, when the\r\ncommittee from his State came for his remains, and as I stood by the\r\ngrave and saw the muddy soil upturned beneath which, many years ago, had\r\nbeen laid the form of a handsome, brave and gallant man, cut down in the\r\nhey-day of his life and hope, I could but wonder at the changes the forty\r\nyears had made. These men, who gave their lives for the cause, believing\r\nas truly as did their sires of old, that they were fighting for the right\r\nof self-government, could they awake to-day would wonder at the turn in\r\nthe tide of affairs. A nation, the greatest in the world—the leader of\r\nthought and action, the champion of the defenseless and the power that\r\nstands for the real advancement of humanity; a people so thoroughly\r\nreunited that many of the very men who fought by the side of this one,\r\nwho died, had fought since in the old uniform, under the old flag against\r\nthe foes of their country. And, strangest of all, not one of the two\r\nthings that this brave life died for would be accepted by his sons if\r\ngiven them to-day—the institution of slavery and the right of a State to\r\nsecede.\r\n\r\nThese, if offered to the South to-day, would be unanimously rejected.\r\nAlas, what is our boasted wisdom but the wisdom of babes? And our\r\nbravery, what more than that of the unthinking school-boy who fights for\r\na ring of marbles which he afterward throws at the birds?\r\n\r\nHere once was a man—free, blessed, brave and handsome.—“Seeking the\r\nbubble reputation, even at the cannon’s mouth.”\r\n\r\nNow, behold, we have gone down to where his body had been laid away, and,\r\ninstead of a form, there is a dark line of mold where the coffin had\r\nbeen, part of the sole of a cavalry boot, a few bones and a skull.\r\n\r\n    “Behold this ruin! ’Twas a skull\r\n    Once of ethereal spirit full.\r\n    This narrow cell was life’s retreat,\r\n    This space was Thought’s mysterious seat.\r\n    What beauteous visions filled this spot!\r\n    What dreams of pleasures long forgot!\r\n    Nor hope, nor joy, nor love, nor fear,\r\n    Have left me trace of record here.\r\n\r\n    Beneath this mouldering canopy\r\n    Once shone the bright and busy eye—\r\n    But start not at its dismal void—\r\n    If social love that eye employed,\r\n    If with no lawless fire it gleamed,\r\n    But through the dews of kindness beamed.\r\n    That eye shall be forever bright\r\n    When sun and stars are sunk in night.\r\n\r\n    Within this hollow cavern hung\r\n    The ready, swift and tuneful tongue;\r\n    If Falsehood’s honey it disdained,\r\n    And, when it could not praise, was chained;\r\n    If bold in Virtue’s cause it spoke,\r\n    Yet gentle concord never broke,\r\n    This silent tongue shall plead for thee\r\n    When time unveils Eternity.”\r\n\r\nStooping, one of his old soldiers bent reverently to lift the skull of\r\nhis general, and place it in the handsome casket intended for its final\r\nresting place. But it clung to the earth, and on looking we see that a\r\nbeautiful rose bush that had been growing all the years at his head had\r\nsent its roots down, completely filling the skull and drawing nourishment\r\nfrom the mind that had once led conquering lines into battle.\r\n\r\n’Tis sentiment only that counts at last. What more beautiful thought than\r\nthat from the brain of the brave should come the perfume of the rose? Or,\r\nas Tennyson, In Memoriam:\r\n\r\n    “’Tis well—’tis something we may stand\r\n    Where he in English soil was laid,\r\n    And from his ashes may be made\r\n    The violets of his native land.”\r\n\r\nThe American nation, being young and foolish—a fighter, a doer, a seeker\r\nof dollars in the strenuous race called living—does not, in this century\r\ncherish as it will centuries hence, such a historical pile as the\r\nbeautiful old chapel. For a sum, right now there are those who pass it\r\ndally who would tear it down to build a stolid stable for their asses.\r\nThere are others who pass it without a thought, save, perhaps, that\r\n’twere a pity so much good brick should go to waste. There are others\r\nwho would like to remodel it, turn it into a dwelling, with Queen Anne\r\nshingles and a portico in front. In England, such piles as these are\r\ntheir inspiration and their pride—sermons in stones, history in walls,\r\nbattles in bricks and mortar. It is these that cement the Englishman’s\r\nlove for his country, its institutions, its laws. It is these which make\r\nhim love to call it home. We are in the reckless, wild oat stage of money\r\ndaring, of wealth producing, of gaudiness and strutting display. There\r\nis no place among us now for the poet and the scholar, the musician, the\r\ndreamer, the preacher. But the time is fast coming when all this will be\r\nchanged—when to be unread is to be unbred—to be rich is to be rotten.

                        —OLE WASH.\r\n\r\nIt will be news to many of my readers when I tell them that the pacing\r\ngait is the oldest and most natural gait of the horse, and that the old\r\npacer was the thoroughbred of antiquity, the companion of kings, the\r\nwarhorse of mighty warriors, the animal that carried on his back the\r\ndaughters of Pharaoh and the princesses of Babylon. And yet, when this\r\ngait began to outcrop among the trotters, making that grand type of the\r\nracehorse known as “trotting-bred pacers,” hundreds of people have been\r\nwondering “Where did it come from?” Let us see from whence it came:\r\n\r\nThere is no real difference in form between the trotter and the pacer.\r\nThe theory of “structural incongruity” will do to talk about, but as a\r\nmatter of fact there is no such thing, and a pacer paces and a trotter\r\ntrots, not from his shape, but his head—his instinct.\r\n\r\nWhen the curtain went up on antiquity, horses were pacing. They paced\r\nbecause it was the natural gait of the animal, the trot of later years\r\nbeing the artificial gait. We know that the horses of the ancients\r\nwere small—pacing ponies—and the running horse was not developed until\r\ncenturies after.\r\n\r\nThe oldest civilizations of which we have any record of the horse are the\r\nEgyptian and the Babylonian. On the tombs the horse was always carved\r\npacing. The frieze of the Parthenon was the work of the great artist\r\nPhidias. His horses were pacers. Five hundred years before the Christian\r\nera the great sculptors of Greece and Rome put some of their greatest\r\nwork into statues of horses—all pacers. Relics of some of the very\r\nearliest Greek friezes are still preserved in the British Museum and show\r\nthe horses to be pacing. At the beginning of the Christian era the Romans\r\nhad conquered the Britons and the horses they found there, or carried\r\nthere, they called “ambulatores”—amblers—and during the five hundred\r\nyears that Rome ruled the island these horses were the favorites for the\r\nsaddle and light driving. In 1215 A.D. the barons wrenched from King John\r\nthe famous Magna Charta, the great seal of which is a knight in armor,\r\nmounted on a pacing horse. In a previous chapter we have told how Sir\r\nWalter Scott describes them and how for centuries the pacing horse—the\r\nambler—the jennet, was the favorite, if not the only saddle horse of the\r\nknights and ladies and the nobility.\r\n\r\nCould such a horse have been a scrub? For many years there has lived\r\nin England a wealthy American who is an artist and a fond lover of\r\nhorses—Mr. Walter Winans. I am indebted to Mr. Winans for many valuable\r\ndiscoveries about the pacer, the first of them being his letter and\r\nillustrations showing the original drawings from the Egyptian tombs,\r\nthese carvings being copied by Mr. Winans while studying ancient Egyptian\r\nsculpture.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, Mr. Walter Winans, of Brighton, England, sent me\r\nsketches of bas-reliefs taken from Egyptian tombs. While never having\r\nhad before the pleasure of seeing a cut of the bas-reliefs sent to\r\nthe writer by Mr. Winans, I have known of their existence and have\r\nrepeatedly called attention to the fact that the past history of the\r\npacer demonstrated beyond a doubt that he was a horse of the noblest\r\nblood, the war-horse of ancient battles, the companion of ancient kings\r\nand princes. The fact that he has been able to do what he has done\r\nis convincing proof of a past greatness somewhere in his breeding—a\r\nscrub would have died at the wire long ago. If “society” is looking\r\nfor something that is blue-blooded, with a hoariness that no other\r\nblue-blooded can boast of; that is eminently respectable to a degree\r\nbordering on classical mythiness; that is more ancient than the pyramids\r\nand more respectable in lineage than the longest pedigree of Norman\r\nknight, I respectfully refer it to the pacer. My only regret in the\r\nmatter is that the recognition, by “society,” of distinguished lineage,\r\nillustrious achievements and present worth cannot be a subject of mutual\r\nacknowledgment and congratulation.\r\n\r\n                                            Brighton, Eng., Jan. 23.\r\n\r\n    Dear Trotwood: I have brought the pacer to more than four\r\n    thousand years ago. Prof. J. E. Marey, Professor of the College\r\n    of France, has just published a book called “Le Movement,”\r\n    dealing with the correct drawings of men and animals in motion.\r\n    He gives two engravings, of which I enclose pen copies, one\r\n    of them from an Assyrian bas relief, the original of which\r\n    is in London, England, British Museum; the other is a copy\r\n    of an ancient Egyptian Bas-relief at Medynet-Abou, in Egypt.\r\n    They both represent horses pacing. Prof. Marey says (freely\r\n    translated from the French). “Examples of a pacing gait are\r\n    here accurately represented. It is of all gaits the easiest to\r\n    observe, and therefore to draw, on account of the symmetry of\r\n    movement.... Trotting, which is so often represented in modern\r\n    works, seems rarely to figure in that of the ancients.”\r\n\r\n    I noticed lately in one of your contemporaries, which goes in\r\n    for “society,” a suggestion that pacing races should not be\r\n    held on days that trotting is indulged in, so as not to offend\r\n    road riders (a long list of which it gives), who dislike to see\r\n    a pacer. It is a good thing that these road riders did not live\r\n    four thousand years ago, or they would have been shocked to\r\n    see all the rulers and great men of Assyria and Egypt driving\r\n    pacers. The ancient Romans called trotters “tormentores,” on\r\n    account of the way they shook them up, riding without stirrups.\r\n\r\n    Referring to the pictures again, the reason the figures\r\n    holding the symbols of authority (the half-circles) and the\r\n    groom at the horses’ heads being so small, is because that in\r\n    ancient Egyptian conventional art figures were not drawn in\r\n    their proper proportions, but large or small, according to the\r\n    importance of the person represented.\r\n\r\n    The Assyrian pacer looks as if he must be the champion stallion\r\n    of the period.\r\n\r\n                              Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                                      WALTER WINANS.\r\n\r\nI agree fully with Mr. Winans concerning the form of the Assyrian pacer\r\nabove. Fewer can show up today with a finer turned muzzle, face and neck,\r\nor show more strength, beauty and symmetry in form than the one in the\r\noutline above. Concerning the cobwebbed suggestion of the “society” paper\r\nabout pacers being barred the track on trotting days, I beg to assure the\r\nauthor of the above letter that the brilliant idea died a-borning. There\r\nis plenty of brains and progressive spirit yet left among the managers\r\nof American trotting associations, and these gentlemen prefer rather\r\nto increase than to diminish the interest in the light harness horse.\r\nThe pacer and the trotter are indissolubly linked together—in interest,\r\ndestiny and blood. They have, too, much of the same breeding, too many\r\nkindred ties. Joined, as they are, by so many common ancestors, united as\r\nthey are by so many great horses, no number of society asses can now pull\r\nthem asunder.\r\n\r\nIn discussing this subject later, Mr. Winans wrote:\r\n\r\n    “There is one difference between a trotter and a pacer which\r\n    I can show in sculpture, which has never been shown before by\r\n    any artists, as painters cannot show it. I mean the upright,\r\n    locomotive-like progression of a trotter and the side stride\r\n    of the pacer. In a picture the difference of the gaits can\r\n    only be shown by the position of the legs. In sculpture we\r\n    can show how a trotter puts down his feet on each side of\r\n    the imaginary line drawn on the ground straight under him,\r\n    in the direction he is going, as the following illustration\r\n    will show.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    “But this is not true with the pacer. On the contrary, he\r\n    puts his feet right on the line, as the following diagram\r\n    will show:\r\n\r\n    [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    “I can better explain myself by the following: If I model a\r\n    horse standing still, and then cut off the two left side legs\r\n    and model fresh ones in the act of being lifted up, so as to\r\n    represent one position of the pace, I would have to push or\r\n    bend the body of the horse over to the left till a plumb line\r\n    from the center of his body would hang down to touch a line\r\n    drawn on the ground from his two feet touching the ground,\r\n    but if I wanted to make a trotter from the same model of a\r\n    standing horse, I could make the fresh legs without having\r\n    to bend over the body to either side.\r\n\r\n    “It is curious that the bronze statuettes of the pacer would\r\n    not stand firm unless I bent the body over, which shows that\r\n    nature knows just how to place animals so that the center\r\n    of gravity should be right. Horses in the instantaneous\r\n    photograph positions balance on their legs, but if I\r\n    model in the conventional position of the run, I have\r\n    to put a prop under the bronze horse’s belly, like most\r\n    artists do.”\r\n\r\nThe subject of the proper balancing of harness horses is generally\r\nrecognized as one of the most important in the business, and it is highly\r\nprobable that more otherwise good drivers fail there, in the proper\r\nmanagement of their horses, than in any other thing. Properly balanced,\r\nthe battle is half over in the training of a naturally speedy horse.\r\n\r\nThe idea suggested in the letter above, if true, as it undoubtedly\r\nappears to be, naturally suggests that a very different system should be\r\nadopted in the proper balancing of pacers and trotters. It is impossible,\r\nof course, to tell how much the individuality of each horse would assert\r\nitself in attaining the ends sought in this direction, but so far as the\r\nmere matter of avoirdupois is concerned, it will be seen that on general\r\nprinciples the pacer, on account of moving a rear and fore foot at the\r\nsame time, can come nearer having both shoes on those feet equal, than\r\nthe trotter, where the aim should be to equalize the alternate feet.\r\n\r\nIt is very plain the balancing required for one will not do for the\r\nother, and horsemen who think they know all about a pacer from successful\r\nhandling of trotters will find out their error. For my own part, I\r\nbelieve it requires less skill to balance a pacer than a trotter, for\r\nthe reason that, because of his simple action he can come nearer wearing\r\nthe same weight on all feet than any other horse. As proof of this I\r\nhave only to refer my readers to the fact that nearly all the very fast\r\npacers carry but little weight, equally distributed, and require little\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThis correspondent has placed us under additional obligations by\r\nenclosing us a pen drawing, executed by himself, on a trip into Northern\r\nRussia, which we reproduce below, and which he calls “a typical pacer\r\nfrom Finland, Russia, used by the peasants for farm work, fourteen hands\r\nhigh.” As Finland is in the northern part of Russia, beyond the latitude\r\nwhere the native horses of any country grow much higher than fourteen\r\nhands, the height is not to be wondered at; and as the peasants of\r\nFinland are of the poorer classes the natural inference is that the pacer\r\nis a natural product of northern Europe, and, no doubt, may be found\r\nin their native state in many, if not all, of these countries, such as\r\nSiberia, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, The Netherlands, and even North Germany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Typical Pacer from Finland, Russia. Used by the Peasants\r\nfor Farm Work—14 Hands High.]\r\n\r\n“There is no native trotter in England,” writes Mr. Winans. “That is to\r\nsay, there is no breed of horse that can beat the very low standard of\r\n3:30. The so-called Norfolk trotter is too slow and is never used for\r\nracing purposes in England. To supply this dearth of trotters, they had\r\nto import from Russia and the United States. Now, a fast trotter from the\r\nStates costs more than the class of men who go in for trotting in England\r\ncared to pay, so pacers, which could go in three minutes or a little\r\nbetter, were got over instead, and as the difference between trotting and\r\npacing is not understood in England, they got to be called trotters, and\r\nraced as trotters. As a proof of their not understanding pacers, a big\r\ndealer in horses saw a friend of the writer’s driving an American pacer\r\nand said, ‘There, that is what I call trotting in good form!’ The other\r\ncountry the English import trotters from is Russia. Now, in Russia there\r\nare two sorts of trotters, the ordinary Orloff carriage horse, which can\r\ngo close to three minutes, if a good one, and the racing Orloff trotter,\r\nwhich can go up to about 2:20. Now, the latter are too expensive, so\r\nthe ordinary Orloff carriage horses were imported. It was soon found\r\nthat they were not fast enough to have any chance even against very poor\r\nAmerican pacers, so the American pacer became the trotter of England.\r\nThis refers to the high class, or what corresponds to the free-for-all\r\ntrots. There is another lower-down class of trotting which is by far the\r\nmost common in England. The races, or generally matches, take place on\r\nthe road, and the police (it is forbidden to race on the roads) often put\r\na stop to the races, and they have to be arranged discreetly. The matches\r\nare announced on some such lines: ‘Mr. So-and-So’s pony, Tommy, matched\r\nfor $25 to trot two miles on the So-and-So road against Mr. So-and-So’s\r\npony, Billy.’\r\n\r\n“By the way, till quite lately a trotter in England was always a pony;\r\nthey did not talk of trotting horses, but trotting ponies. For this class\r\nof racing the ponies are some 12½ to 14½ hands high and driven to very\r\nheavy, old-fashioned sulkies. The ponies used are not English-bred, but\r\nwhat are called in England ‘Russian’ ponies. They are not really Russian,\r\nbut come from Finland. These ‘Finnish’ ponies are a distinct breed.\r\nThey are on an average 14½ hands high or under, strongly built, with\r\nthick, short necks, very good feet and legs, bushy tails, and very hard\r\nmouths. They are generally all shades of sorrel, dun or chestnut, many\r\nwith donkey marks down the back, and light-colored manes and tails, and\r\nthey are for the most part natural pacers. These are the horses that are\r\nused in St. Petersburg for the public droshkies which ply for hire and\r\nare very cheap. Some can go close to three minutes, with an occasional\r\none close to 2:40, and are imported wholesale into England for light\r\ntradesmen’s use. In Russia they are also used by the peasants for farm\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n“The Orloff trotter is quite free from pacing. The many I have driven\r\nhave never showed the least sign of pacing, with one single exception;\r\nthis horse was not one of the racing Orloffs, but one of an ordinary\r\ncarriage pair. I think he had a cross of the ‘Fin’ pony, by his shape. He\r\nused to pace when jogging, but I never tried to get any speed at the pace\r\nout of him.\r\n\r\n“The little ‘Fin’ ponies are very fast occasionally for their size.\r\nAs an instance, we had a black pair of Orloffs when I was last in St.\r\nPetersburg, which used to pass everything on the road. It is the custom\r\nthere, when you have fast horses, to brush with anything you meet. One\r\nday a victoria, drawn by two little dun-colored ‘Fin’ ponies, with some\r\nladies in it, came along. We turned out to pass them and they ran right\r\naway from us, which no big pair had been able to do all the summer. This\r\nparticular pair trotted, but as I said before, most of them are pacers,\r\nand these are what race in the minor races in England as ‘trotting\r\nponies.’”\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is evident—the pace is the natural and probably the first\r\nfast gait of the horse.\r\n\r\n(To Be Continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEducating the Horse\r\n\r\nBy DR. J. C. HENNESSEY, RENO, NEVADA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe horse is conceded to be the most intelligent of animals, the best\r\nfriend to man, and until recently the most universally used and most\r\nnecessary; yet the same animal is also the most universally abused. Men\r\nhitch the poor animals in harness that is sometimes too small, or too\r\nlarge, as the case may be, and in consequence he rebels and refuses to\r\npull a load when by doing so he suffers torments by chafing, or from\r\nchoking, if the collar be too small. This is all that is necessary to\r\nstigmatize the poor brute as being balky, and unless some humane person\r\nhappens to run across the animal it will be spoiled, and no one will\r\ntake it as a gift. Now, as a matter of fact, the horse that absolutely\r\nrefuses to be treated thus is the horse that has the right material in\r\nhim and the one that will give you most service, providing you treat him\r\nright. The horse I own was such an animal and was given up as a “runaway”\r\nand “kicker.” Yet he is now so gentle that he will absolutely refuse\r\nto run away on any pretense whatever. Upon hearing that a fine looking\r\nbut “mean” horse was for sale, I took occasion to visit the owner and\r\nlearn something of the “outlaw.” After seeing the animal, even after I\r\nhad learned that he had been in runaways and had broken up at least four\r\nbuggies, I bought him for $150, but not until I had made a phrenological\r\nexamination and found that the horse was particularly well supplied, as\r\nI thought, with good horse sense. I could see that his disposition was\r\n“keyed” up pretty high and that trait combined with a broad forehead and\r\na good eye, suited me, and was what I always select in an animal. The\r\nprice was as nothing, when we consider that he was a Woodnut by Nutwood,\r\nand that his sire sold for $22,000, and his grandsire for, I think,\r\nconsiderably more.\r\n\r\nI only drove the animal a few times before he was as gentle as a lamb and\r\nhas never committed one unkind act while I was with him. He now performs\r\ntwenty tricks and is trained to hunt, and enjoys it. I shoot over his\r\nhead and he waits for me to get the game. He will stop when he sees a\r\nrabbit and expects me to shoot it. If you want your animals to be kind to\r\nyou you must first treat them kindly. After driving this “runaway horse”\r\nfor a few months my wife and I drove across the mountains on a hunting\r\ntrip. On going down a steep grade the buggy upset and we were both thrown\r\nout, but the wild horse absolutely refused to run away. He would have\r\nbeen as kind to his former owner if he had been treated properly. You can\r\ntyrannize over some people, while others will fight back, and it is just\r\nso with animals.\r\n\r\nA horse never forgets anything, and if he is badly scared in a certain\r\nplace, he will show the same fear if brought back to that place a\r\nyear afterwards. A horse will develop the same disposition as the man\r\nwho drives him, and if the man is nervous and fretful, by continually\r\njerking the lines and striking the horse with a whip, he instills this\r\nirritability into the poor horse, and sooner or later the animal starts\r\nup too soon, and, expecting to be whipped, runs off at the top of his\r\nspeed, perhaps killing somebody. Of course, the poor horse is to blame\r\nfor this (?). Sometimes he is hitched so close to the wagon that he\r\ncannot trot without striking his hocks against the vehicle and, thinking\r\nhe is being abused, he will run away. If the traces are too tight he will\r\nsuffer from sore shoulder or sore neck.\r\n\r\nNever allow a blacksmith to spring a shoe in a place by pressing down\r\nand nailing. Have him take the shoe off and straighten it on the anvil.\r\nDo not allow him to cut the frog away as it furnishes nourishment and\r\nmoisture to the hoof. Don’t check your horse too high unless you wish him\r\nto be knee sprung. In shoeing horses some people are of the same opinion\r\nas is John Chinaman when buying boots. They want to get all the material\r\nthey can for their money and in shoeing a horse too heavy you not only\r\nruin his gait, but cause him to get tired sooner than he otherwise\r\nwould. In driving, control your animal by speaking to him. By following\r\nthis method and being kind, not allowing yourself to lose your temper,\r\nyou will be surprised at the control you will have over your horse in\r\na short time. If the animal wishes to run away there is no man strong\r\nenough to hold him. You cannot stop a runaway by sawing on the bit, but\r\nif you will not lose presence of mind and not get excited, you can stop\r\nany horse and cure him of trying to run by the following method: Grasp\r\nthe lines tightly and pull as tight as you can. Let one line slip through\r\nyour fingers (not losing it entirely), and pull hard with the other,\r\nwhich will bring the horse’s head around to the side. If you hold his\r\nhead in that position you will throw him down as the legs will become\r\nmixed by thus drawing the head to the side. If you leave his head free\r\nonce more he will stagger but not fall and will have great respect for\r\nthe driver who can thus mix him up. This is something that every one\r\nshould know, as no horse can run unless he can have his head in front of\r\nhim. To control him it is necessary to jerk the head quickly, and the\r\ndriver must keep the horse from turning around, thus upsetting the rig.\r\nShould your horse get frightened at any object, do not whip him; scold\r\nhim and drive him carefully up to the object and he will eventually\r\nbecome so gentle and observing that he will recognize objects and not get\r\nfrightened at them.\r\n\r\nShould he get away from you do not get into a passion and beat the animal\r\nas soon as you get him again, for he will always remember it and you\r\nmight be miles away from home and should he get loose, you will have to\r\nwalk, as he will not care for another beating and will leave you “alone\r\nin your glory.” On the other hand, if you are kind to him you can go\r\namong a band of wild horses, and yours will leave them for you.\r\n\r\nHorses know more than they are given credit for and have been known to\r\ncarry their master home when the owner was intoxicated and unable to\r\nwalk after getting there. A great many horses are spoiled by the driver\r\nforcing them to do something when the horse does not know what is wanted\r\nof him. Show him what you wish him to do and he will do it. Never fool\r\nyour horse and always praise and reward him for doing good. Horsemen\r\nwill tell you that it spoils a horse to teach him tricks. Does it spoil\r\na child to educate him? My buggy horse that performed twenty tricks was\r\nthought to be a spoiled horse but at the State fair I could not get a\r\nrace for him with trotters and had to enter him with pacers that were\r\ngoing in :17, :19 and :20. He was never driven better than :26, but did\r\nnot make a break, and won handily in straight heats, and the last was\r\n:24. In trying to beat him they ran him into a fence, and on the back\r\nstretch locked wheels, making him drag the other under the wire in :24.\r\nThat did not excite him, because I had educated him and he came back\r\nthe next heat (fourth) in :24 in a jog. By educating your horse, you\r\ngive him courage, make him brave, and he becomes almost human, just\r\nlike Lou Dillon when, in a mighty drive she becomes part and parcel\r\nof the greatest educator of animals who ever existed—Millard Sanders.\r\nThe old familiar quotation, “Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,\r\nand waste its sweetness on the desert air,” is exemplified time and\r\nagain, when we see trainers driving animals with a world of speed, not\r\nknowing how to shoe, handle or drive them. Would education spoil these\r\nmen? Training, gaiting and educating a horse is a mathematical problem,\r\nand the man who can teach a little each day and who understands that by\r\nincreasing the action in front means something to the hind hoofs, and by\r\nslowing up the action behind means something to the front hoofs just as\r\nit does to multiply and subtract, is the man who takes the purse at the\r\nrace meeting even if he does not make a hit in his workouts. When you\r\nwish to train to perform tricks, start in with the easiest one first\r\nand begin in the following way:\r\n\r\nThe first and easiest trick to teach a horse is to say “no.” Stand on the\r\nleft side and with a tack prick him gently on the withers. He will shake\r\nhis head. Ask him a question, at the same instant you prick him, and\r\nafter awhile he will get so used to the inflection of your voice that he\r\nwill shake his head every time you ask, without the use of the tack. To\r\nteach him to say “yes” prick him on the breast. Be gentle, so he will not\r\nget in the habit of snapping at you. For instance, ask him if he likes\r\npolitics and he will shake his head “No.” Ask him if he reads Trotwood’s\r\nMonthly, and he will nod his head “Yes.” Next, teach him to lie down.\r\nSome teach this trick by the aid of ropes. The easiest way is to take the\r\nhorse out of the stall, or, better, after a drive, just after unhitching,\r\nwhile he is sweating, lead him to the corral and say “Lie down, sir.” He\r\nwill obey, because he wants to roll. After he gets up give him some sugar\r\nand pet him. After doing this several times he learns what is wanted of\r\nhim and finds that by obeying he gets his sugar. Next, you wish him to\r\nkneel. This is easy, as he must always kneel to lie down. By holding the\r\nrope, you can allow him only to kneel after which you give him sugar and\r\npet him.\r\n\r\nTo teach him to sit up it is first necessary to make him lie down. Then\r\nsay, “Get up, sir.” By holding the rope, allow him to get up on the front\r\nfeet only. Next you wish him to open a box. Get one with hinges and have\r\nthe lid extend a little over the box. Allow him to eat out of it several\r\ntimes, being sure to close the lid frequently while he is eating. He will\r\nsee you throw the lid back and in a short time will do so himself, that\r\nhe may eat the grain. After this be sure to pet him. In a short time\r\nyou can send him from a distance to the box and he will open the lid.\r\nTo teach him to kiss you is the easiest of all. If he likes candy, as\r\nall pets do, place a piece in your mouth, and he will reach for it. Say,\r\n“Kiss me, sir,” and he will attempt to get it. He will become accustomed\r\nto the command, after a few times and will obey the order without the\r\ncandy. Next you wish him to stand on a barrel. Lead him to a box, about\r\nfive or six inches high, being sure to have it solid so it will not turn.\r\nAfter getting him as close to it as possible, raise one hoof and place it\r\non the box, then raise the other and place it by the first, after which\r\ngive him the usual reward. As he gets used to this trick increase the\r\nheight of the box until you have it as high as you wish and he will climb\r\nup to get the sugar. Teach him to shake hands by picking up his hoof and,\r\nat the same time, giving the command, “Shake hands, sir.” To teach a\r\nhorse to tell his age or the time of day, or to multiply, subtract or add\r\nnumbers is the hardest of all and requires a great amount of maneuvering\r\non the part of the trainer. Get him impatient and he will paw the ground\r\nwith his hoofs. Pat him every time and he soon learns what you want. The\r\nhard part is to make him stop at the right number. Of course there is a\r\nkey to this and an easy method may be used. I stand close to my horse and\r\nnudge him with my elbow when I want him to stop. For instance, I ask him\r\nto multiply 7 × 2, and he paws 14 times. To have him stop I nudge him\r\njust after he paws the thirteenth time, and he stops on the fourteenth.\r\nTrain him to stop, to turn corners, and to turn around in this way: When\r\ndriving go the same way a number of times, always turning to go home in\r\nthe same place and being careful to turn slowly. Say, “Whoa,” and then,\r\n“Turn around, sir.” After a little coaxing with the rein he will do this.\r\nIn a little while he will know what is required of him every time you ask\r\nhim to turn. Get him used to your gun by driving him with an open bridle\r\nand, for the first few times, shooting back from the buggy. By proper\r\nhandling he will, after a time, stop when you level your gun to shoot or,\r\nas my horse does, when he sees anything to shoot at. Teach your horse to\r\nplay tag, by giving some person his sugar and having him run from the\r\nhorse. The animal will learn to put his ears back, show his teeth and\r\nrun for the sugar. This should only be taught horses that are perfectly\r\ngentle, as it makes them cross. When they find people are afraid of them\r\nthey always enjoy frightening them. Many horses are considered of no\r\nvalue because their owner does not know how they should be shod. I shall\r\nbe pleased to answer any communications from people who wish to know\r\nhow to shoe horses, how to avoid interfering, forging, or any of the bad\r\nhabits horses may have. All can be rectified if people only know how.\r\nRemember you can only teach a horse through kindness. As soon as you lose\r\npatience he will be spoiled.\r\n\r\nIn driving an animal, if you treat it kindly and do not lash it with the\r\nwhip when there is no occasion for doing so, it will become attached to\r\nyou and will cool down in a moment of danger or excitement, as it feels\r\nthat you are its friend and going to protect it; whereas, if you were in\r\nthe habit of abusing it you may get into a “tight place” and the horse\r\nwill get excited and perhaps kill you. This is something that people\r\nshould understand, and how much more satisfactory it is to have your\r\nanimals watch for your home-coming and have them run to greet you than\r\nto have them afraid and shrink and expect the lash every time you move.\r\nTeach your animals to be courageous, and then whatever they do they will\r\ngo through on their courage and not by the whip. My animal was very fast\r\nand I hired a trainer to train him for the track. I gave him instruction\r\nnot to whip the horse, and being headstrong thought he knew it all, so\r\none day he struck him with the whip and was immediately kicked out of the\r\ncart. The horse ran for about fifty yards and stopped. I informed the\r\ntrainer that he received his just deserts and he never drove him again.\r\nIn this instance the horse knew more than the man, and I have seen many\r\nsuch instances. It is not right that we abuse animals, and we should not\r\nbe permitted to do so. They are willing to obey us and will always do so\r\nif we give them a chance and I am delighted when I see a horse that will\r\nhave the courage to resist ill treatment. Some people check their horses\r\nup to the skies and never put the check down when they tie them, but\r\nleave the poor animals tied to a post for hours with their neck stretched\r\nso that they are in constant pain. It would be a good law that would\r\ncause such men to suffer the same punishment.\r\n\r\nIt is a very wrong thing to feed a horse too much hay. It only distends\r\nthe stomach, and gives the animal an ungainly appearance. Feed him\r\nregularly, and four quarts of oats is a good feed for a buggy horse.\r\n\r\nWhen purchasing a horse, stand directly in front of the animal and look\r\nat front hoofs. If they toe-in, buy; but if they toe-out, do not accept\r\nas a gift, as every time he picks his hoofs up, if he is going fast,\r\nhe will strike his shin or knee, whereas, if he toes in, he will pick\r\nthem up from his knees and never interfere and you will not be under the\r\nnecessity of placing boots on every time you wish to speed him. They\r\nshould toe out behind and in that case they spread and pass their front\r\nhoofs when going fast and will not “forge” or strike their quarters.\r\nIt is a very common thing for a horse to trot along and by forging you\r\ncan hear them a block away. The click, click is caused by the hind feet\r\nstriking the front ones, and is very annoying, and at the same time is\r\nvery bad for the horse. You can remedy this by shoeing in front with all\r\nthe weight in the toe, causing him to pick up the hoof quicker and thus\r\ngetting it out of the way of the hind shoe when it comes along. If he\r\ninterferes behind, shoe with weight on the outside to spread the hoofs. A\r\nhorse should be shod every four or five weeks, as the hoof grows and the\r\nshoe interferes with its expansion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo man can be great who does not believe in himself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMANCIPATION\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [The author of this poem passed away a few years ago—“Gone in\r\n    the morning and there was no night there.” This immortal poem\r\n    deserves to rank with that other—“There is no death.”—Ed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Why be afraid of Death, as though your life were breath?\r\n    Death but anoints your eyes with clay.

D. BABCOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Old Wash.\r\n\r\nOLD WASH’S LITTLE PREACHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other day I was whistling that coon song:\r\n\r\n    “All coons look alike to me.”\r\n\r\nThe old man was poisoning potato bugs on our second crop of Irish\r\npotatoes. It was getting along “t’wards de shank of de ebenin’,” as I had\r\nheard him so often express it, and I have noticed about that time that\r\nthe old man is always hunting for some excuse to stop working. “Dar am\r\njes’ two sho’ nuff fools in dis wurl,” I have heard him say—“one am de\r\nman dat wucks all de time an de yudder am de ’oman dat don’t wuck at all.”\r\n\r\nI was not surprised, then, to see the old man set down his can of Paris\r\ngreen and water and give vent to a prolonged laugh. I have learned that\r\nthe way to catch the old man is to get him when he is “fit and ready”—the\r\nsame as a horse when he is expected to break the record—and I might carry\r\nit further and say you can’t always tell when he is ready. But there are\r\ncertain signs you can go by.\r\n\r\nAnd so the old man has signs, too—that he is ready to go a heat in an\r\nold time yarn—and one is when the sun gets low and the bugs high—when\r\na watermelon is waiting in the spring trough and the sheep on the hill\r\nbegin to come out from the shaded woods for their evening meal in the\r\nmeadow—now cooling with the condensing shadows of a setting sun.\r\n\r\nThe sign he gives is a furtive glance around and a big, chuckling laugh.\r\n\r\nI had cut around the melon with my pocket-knife, and broken it open on a\r\nbig rock, which left the jagged, juicy heart bulging out in a tempting\r\nlump. But I divided as equally as I could, under the circumstances, and\r\nas we sat in the shade of the elm by the big spring I shoved him his half\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n“Now that’s for what you were laughing at just now—out with it.”\r\n\r\n“I doan’ blame white folks fur sayin’ all coons look alike, fur I tried\r\nit onct and I thou’t I knowed my own kid—thou’t ef it cum to de scratch\r\nI cu’d do lak a hoss an’ tell ’im by hees smell, ennyway. But when I wus\r\nput to de test I foun’ dey not only all look alike, but smell alike,\r\ntoo—an’ dar’s whar I cum mighty nigh gittin’ into de wuss scrape I eber\r\ngot into.”\r\n\r\n“Way back in slabery time, when a young p’ar ob niggers ’ud marry, de\r\nrule wus dey was to lib wid de gal’s muther ontwel de fust chile was\r\nbohn.

Es dey all libbed from one ter ten miles aroun’ on de farms,\r\nthinks I, dar’ll be lots ob fun in de mawnin’! Dinah tuck ernuver look\r\nat hern befo’ she went to sleep, an’ den I heurd her whoop: ‘Glory,’ she\r\nsaid, ‘my chile is done turned yaller—glory—glory!’ She heard of it\r\nbein’ done onct befo’ an’ b’leeved it. Wal, I seed she had her h’art sot\r\non it so bad I ’lowed I’d let it go at dat, ’specially es dey nurver had\r\nbeen a preacher in de family, but all er mine hed tuck to hoss racin’ an’\r\nDinah was so happy over it she c’u’dn’t sleep.\r\n\r\n“I sed dar ’u’d be a time in de mawnin’, but bless you’ soul, honey, it\r\nstarted befo’ day. Lights was seen flashin’ eb’rywhere an’ niggers was\r\nrunnin roun’ wailin’ an’ weepin’ an’ wonderin’. De black uns had yaller\r\nbabies an’ yaller ’uns had black ’uns, de upper crust had scrub babies\r\nan’ de leetle black cohn fiel’ scrubs wus in de highes’ nigger socshul\r\nswim—wid de house gals an’ maids an’ qualerty niggers. Wuss en all, de\r\nchilluns jes’ slept rat on an’ didn’t seem to keer whar dey wus an’ who\r\ndey b’longed to. I tell you, boss, ef you eber gits bothered ’bout yo’\r\nchap not goin’ to sleep, jes’ gin ’im a good dose ob hoss medercine!\r\n\r\n“It ’u’d been all right, an’ jes’ a joke, ef dey hadn’t stirred up ole\r\nVoodoo Jake, de witch doctor. He ’lowed de babies was all right but dey\r\nhad been voodooed an’ de culler changed, an’ he’d hafter rub ’em all wid\r\nde ile ob a black cat killed in de full moon on de grabe ob a man dat hab\r\nbeen hung fur murder, an’ dey’d be all right. A nigger jes’ nachu’lly\r\nb’leeves all dis, ’specially all dem dat had de yaller babies an’ not one\r\non ’em ’ud gin ’em up.\r\n\r\n“An’ dat’s hu’cum I got a yaller offspring in my family ter-day, I am\r\nsorry ter say. But arter awhile it got sorter mernoternous, an’ I thort\r\nI’d lak ter git my own black baby back, an’ I tole ole Marster whut I\r\ndone, an’ sum of de niggers raised sech a stir dat de white folks hilt\r\na meetin’ an’ did git sum on ’em back ag’in, but dey’s jes’ about ha’f\r\nof ’em now in dat community dat don’t kno’ who dey daddies is. But dat’s\r\nnachul, you kno’. But Dinah hed got stuck on de yaller baby, an’ de\r\npreacher’s wife on de black one, an’ tho’ I kicked about it I c’u’dn’t do\r\nnuffin’. I tole eb’rybody how I dun it fur a joke, but dey all sed I wus\r\nsech a liar dey wouldn’t b’leeve me. Ole Marster laff, an’ say he hated\r\nto swap off a good black colt for a yaller one, but ef it suited de\r\nwimmin folks it suited him, an’ so dar I was.\r\n\r\n“Wal, dey soon found I was right, for when de boys growed up a leetle,\r\nan’ big ’nuff fur dey pedergree to sho’ up, whut you’ reckin my black un\r\ndun ’fore he ten yeahs ole? De preacher tuck ’im ter campmeetin’ an’ he\r\ngot up a mule race on de outside an’ broke up his daddy’s campmeetin’\r\none day by ridin’ ole Marster’s gray mule cl’ar over a bunch of mourners\r\nan’ spite of punishment an’ pra’ars arter dat, he tuck to ole Marster’s\r\nstable an’ dey ain’t nurver got him out of it yit.\r\n\r\n“An’ dat yaller dog I got, he warn’t long showin’ de mettle er his\r\npasture an’ de proof er his pedergree,” and the old man sighed and looked\r\ntroubled.\r\n\r\n“How?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Boss,” he said sadly, “befo’ he was ten yeahs ole he stole eb’ry yaller\r\nlegged chicken in de na’borhood.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Open\r\n\r\nA CHRISTMAS GOOSE HUNT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe graceful and beautiful wild goose that nests in the Canadian and\r\nNorthern lakes and marshes, makes his winter home in Tennessee. I think\r\nit is the winter wheat that attracts him, as he passes over us, en route\r\nto Florida, for wheat is sown in October in Tennessee and by Christmas\r\nit is as green as the marsh grasses he left behind in Canada. I do not\r\nblame the wild goose for stopping. He has flown for many weary days and\r\nnights, over cold and lifeless lands; over mountains brown and sere; over\r\nwoodlands stripped of leaves and bare and uninviting. All day long the\r\n“konk,” “konk” of the leader sounds from the point of the triangle that\r\ncuts its ceaseless way through the thin, cold air. Night after night they\r\nrest on frozen pond or reedy lake. But one day the air grows sweet and\r\nbalmy; they look below them at a landscape, which, at their altitude,\r\nlooks like a mighty lake whose waves are fields of green wheat, broken by\r\nislands of dark green hills. It is the Basin of Tennessee. No wonder they\r\ncome down to earth again. If I were an angel with wings and on my way to\r\nheaven by the same route, methinks I’d do the same thing.\r\n\r\n“But the wild goose did not always winter here,” said Mr. Adcock, the\r\noldest goose hunter in my town. “I can remember when they first began\r\nto come in. I think they began to come in after the country got to be\r\nmore open and the wheat fields so large that they could alight in the\r\nmidst of one and the sentinel on guard could see the approach of any\r\nhunter. They live to an extreme old age. I know of one flock which\r\nwinters annually in the Bear Creek neighborhood and has wintered there\r\nfor forty-two years. The leader of the flock is known to be at least that\r\nold. He has a peculiar white mark on his back and is readily recognized\r\neach year by the hunters in that section. They propagate very fast in\r\ntheir summer homes, for when this flock left last year it had been\r\nreduced to eighteen in number. This year, when it came back, led again by\r\nthe old gander, it had increased to two hundred and eighty. But I do not\r\nthink there is a man in that country who would shoot at that old leader\r\nwith the white mark on him.”\r\n\r\nThere has always been something peculiarly fascinating to me in the\r\nflight of a wild goose or wild duck. I have run up on wild turkeys and\r\nseen them in their wild and awkward flight, and while it is beautiful\r\nsport to kill a strutting old gobbler who comes to you, allured by your\r\ncall, and while it is finer sport the next day to sample him when he is\r\nbaked and browned to a queen’s taste, yet after all he is bred and raised\r\nwith us, he comes from our woods, not from far distant shores, walks over\r\nthe earth, does not cleave, like the wild goose, the\r\n\r\n    —“Pale, purpling evening—”\r\n\r\nwhich in the language of the poet\r\n\r\n    —“Melts around thy flight.”\r\n\r\nAnd so there is a mystery about him that, to me, is the mystery of other\r\nlands and worlds. There is about him the manner as of one who comes from\r\ndistant climes; there is the everlasting wonder which to me always hangs\r\naround the whistle of wings, the admiration for the creature to whom God\r\nhas given the power to soar above the sordid things of earth and bathe\r\ntheir plumage in that air which is born of the sunset and the silent\r\nstars. And in this connection where, in all language, is there a more\r\nbeautiful poem of its kind than Bryant’s “To a Waterfowl?” I shall copy\r\nit in its entirety here, because it so beautifully expresses what we\r\ncommoner mortals can only feel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The High Limestone Bluffs of Duck River.]\r\n\r\n        Whither, midst falling dew,\r\n    While glow the heavens with the last steps of day\r\n        Far, through their rosy depths dost thou pursue\r\n    Thy solitary way?\r\n\r\n        Vainly the fowler’s eye\r\n    Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong,\r\n        As, darkly painted on the crimson sky,\r\n    Thy figure floats along.\r\n\r\n        Seekest thou the plashy brink\r\n    Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,\r\n        Or where the rocking billows rise and sink\r\n    On the chafed ocean side?\r\n\r\n        There is a Power whose care\r\n    Teaches thy way along that pathless coast—\r\n        The desert and illimitable air—\r\n    Lone wanderer, but not lost.\r\n\r\n        All day thy wings have fanned\r\n    At that far height, the cold, thin atmosphere.\r\n        Ye stoop not, weary, to the welcome land\r\n    Though the dark night is near.\r\n\r\n        And soon that toil shall end,\r\n    Soon shalt thou find a summer home and rest,\r\n        And scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend\r\n    Soon o’er thy sheltered breast.\r\n\r\n        Thou’rt gone—the abyss of heaven\r\n    Hath swallowed up thy form; yet on my heart\r\n        Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given\r\n    And shall not soon depart.\r\n\r\n        He who, from zone to zone\r\n    Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight\r\n        In the long way that I must tread alone\r\n    Will lead my steps aright.\r\n\r\nFor several weeks I had seen the wild geese flying over us. I knew where\r\nthey were going—to the wheat fields—and I knew where they roosted at\r\nnight—under the shadow of the bluff of the river, sitting like swans on\r\nthe dark waters. I hold it of guns as I do of sulkies and road carts—any\r\ngood make is good enough. It all depends on whom you happen to start in\r\nwith. If built by honest men, out of honest stuff, there is but little\r\ndifference in the rest of it. I happen to fancy the Ithaca and had just\r\ngot me a new one, and for hard, clean, honest shooting, wear and tear,\r\nI’ll put it against any of them.\r\n\r\nThere is only one way to hunt wild geese successfully, and I had prepared\r\nall of that; or rather my friend Jno. W. Jackson, assistant postmaster,\r\nand the best all-round hunter and fisherman in Tennessee, had—in fact\r\nit is part of our stable and belongs in our barn on the rafters, along\r\nwith the saddle and harness: a strong, light canoe that will hold three\r\npeople, two big reflecting headlight lanterns that will light up the\r\nriver from bank to bank, and for very cold weather a good Clark or\r\nLehman heater to drop in the bottom of the canoe and put your feet on\r\nif they get cold. Then, with a laprobe over your knees, good gloves and\r\novercoat, and Jimmy Caldwell, who knows every crook and turn of the river\r\nfor a hundred miles, to paddle it, you are ready for the finest sport\r\non this side the globe. It was just noon when my man, Frank, hooked up\r\nthe blue roan Chestnut Hal mare to the buckboard. In the rear were my\r\nblankets and gun, and oil-cloth to sleep on; also a saddle and bridle.\r\nThere is something about a blue roan that I always have liked. It reminds\r\nme of steel. I have never seen a quitter that was that color. It is\r\nremarkable how often the roan horse figures in the living romance of\r\nour literature. Who that has ever read it has forgotten the strawberry\r\nroan mare of the big-hearted robber in “Lorna Doone”—to my mind as fine\r\na novel as was ever written—a kind of Shakespeare in prose in the wild\r\nwoods. Do you remember Browning’s “How They Brought the Good News from\r\nGhent to Aix,” and the roan that dropped dead but never gave up the race?\r\nBy the way, there are, in that poem, two of as fine descriptive verses of\r\nhorses in motion as I ever read:\r\n\r\n    “At Aerschot, up leaped of a sudden the sun\r\n    And against him the cattle stood black every one,\r\n    To stare through the mist at us galloping past\r\n    And I saw my stout galloper, Roland, at last,\r\n    With resolute shoulders, each butting away\r\n    The haze, as some bluff river headland the spray.\r\n    And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back\r\n    For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track;\r\n    And one eye’s black intelligence—ever that glance\r\n    O’er its white edge at me, his own master, askance!\r\n    And the thick, heavy spume-flakes, which aye and anon,\r\n    His fierce lips shook upward in galloping on”\r\n\r\nI claim that the Hals are the best all-round horses in the world—they are\r\ntireless roadsters and jog, at a trot, a good road gait. By half past\r\none I was in Williamsport—twelve miles—and the roan mare had not struck\r\na pace—her fastest gait. After crossing the river and getting into the\r\nrough roads over the hills of Hickman County, she climbed them like a\r\nmountain goat, for if there is anything a pacer likes it is to chop up\r\nhis gait for hill work. Not once did she make a misstep. The chief beauty\r\nof these hunts, to me, had always been in the fact that I had only to\r\nthrow a saddle on this mare, after getting to camp, and I had an easy\r\nseat all day in our rides over the hills and fields in pursuit of that\r\nmost delightful of all Southern game—quail. It knocks the sport out of\r\nthings when you have to take one horse to drive and another to ride, and\r\nanother to do this, and another that. Reared for generations as one of\r\nthe family, the Hal horse can come very nearly doing everything that his\r\nmaster can, and if this mare had asked me for a toddy before breakfast\r\nthe next morning I should not have been at all surprised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Duck River, Where the Wild Geese Roost.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the fertility of Middle Tennessee, the field on the\r\nright has been in cultivation ninety years, has had no fertilizers except\r\nrotation and clover, and produced this year two crops of Irish potatoes\r\nof fifty and ninety barrels per acre, respectively.]\r\n\r\nMy destination was the little village of Shady Grove, way up in the\r\nfoothills, and yet down in a little valley thirty miles from nowhere. We\r\nreached it just before sunset, when the smoke began to curl up out of the\r\nchimneys for the evening meal, and I stopped on the high hill and looked\r\ndown on the quiet scene. I have always held that it does a man good to\r\nget away from the sound of trade and traffic now and then, and for my\r\npart there is nothing that appeals to me so much as to look down on one\r\nof these little villages in the hills and speculate on the simple life\r\nthat exists there. So free from the knockout battles of the modern life,\r\nso simple and quiet and wanting so little. There is the school house,\r\nyonder the quaint little church which means so much to them and, whether\r\nnarrow, quaint or clannish, we must admit are the real bulwarks of all\r\nthe great moral structures that are the strength and pride and glory of\r\ntwentieth century progress. The little homes cluster around these two.\r\nOnce a day the mail boy rides over the hills on his pacing horse, with\r\nthe thoughts of the rest of the world in his leathern pouch. In the\r\ntwilight I could see that the village blacksmith, a sturdy, handsome\r\nyoung fellow, was forging a horse-shoe. A pretty girl came out of the\r\nlittle postoffice and locked the door. She stopped at the blacksmith’s\r\nas she passed and they laughed and made love. I smiled as I drove on,\r\nand said: “This is the glorious twentieth century with all its knowledge\r\nand science and progress, and yet when we come to think of it we are\r\nright where we were two hundred years ago, for in spite of engines and\r\nautomobiles the two things that progress must have first of all, before\r\nshe can move a foot—is a horse-shoe and—love.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy destination was three miles farther—at Hen Island—but, when I reached\r\nit night had set in and, to my astonishment, I saw neither camp nor\r\ncanoe. It is one hundred miles by river to Hen Island, a fine all-day and\r\nall-night float, with plenty of geese and ducks. The canoe had started\r\ndown with the Old Hunter and Mr. Jackson, the setter dog and the camping\r\noutfit, and I expected them to meet me with a full game bag, and to have\r\nthe camp pitched and supper ready. Instead, I sat alone on the banks of\r\na river, in the chill of a winter’s evening, out in the woods, and with\r\nno prospect of anything but the ground to sleep on. I had begun to feel\r\nuneasy and dreadfully lonesome, when I noticed a native come down to\r\nwater the mule he was riding. In answer to my inquiry he said that the\r\nOld Hunter had landed there that morning and had tacked a card on the\r\nsycamore tree near where I stood. I struck a match and soon deciphered\r\nthe old man’s peculiar spelling, which told me he had gone on two miles\r\nfurther to camp at a better place.\r\n\r\nA camp-fire at night will draw two months’ work and worry out of a man.\r\nHow grand the trees look in the big, weird flashes of the firelight in\r\nfront of the tent! The setter dog is at home and welcomes you with his\r\nhonest bark and playful gambols. You can smell the fine flavor of the\r\nboiling coffee (does any other ever taste so good?) a quarter of a mile\r\nbefore you get to it, while the odor that comes up from the “skillet” is\r\nenough to bring every wolf out of the woods. In addition to all this the\r\nOld Hunter had two barbecued squirrels and, best of all, a mallard which\r\nhe had cooked in his own inimitable way. That is to say, he had dressed\r\nit, all except taking off the feathers. Then he had pasted a wet clay all\r\nover it, wrapped it in wet paper and buried it just under the sod of the\r\ncamp fire. In two hours it was pronounced done, and then he had taken\r\nit out, soon after I came up, and with a few hefty touches had peeled\r\nthe clay and feathers off, with the skin. You may not think this is good\r\nuntil you eat it at camp; then you will not want to eat duck any other\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe night had grown intensely dark, it seemed to me. The setter was\r\nasleep by the camp-fire, the river sang a surly song as it swept by in\r\nthe blackness and ever and anon the “konk” of a flock of wild geese\r\nsounded from out the heavens as if they still flew about, disdaining\r\nto go to roost. In my vanity I supposed that they had heard that I had\r\narrived and so concluded it was best to spend the night in the air.\r\n\r\nWe did not wish to start until nearly midnight and as we sat around the\r\nfire the Old Hunter grew mellow and reminiscent and this was one of the\r\nfunny stories he told me.\r\n\r\n“Talk about horses breakin’ the record, an’ all that, but do you kno’\r\nthat in my young days I broke all the records that ever was an’ ever will\r\nbe, s’fur as a pacin’ hoss is concerned? Whut’s Star Pointer’s time?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nI told him.\r\n\r\nHe grunted doubtfully. “Wal, I think I was sixteen an’ about as hefty\r\na lad as ever plowed a furrer. Lemme see; I was either sixteen or it\r\nwas the year my daddy was the proud father of his sixteenth child, I’ve\r\nforgotten which; but I had to work like an ox all week plowin’ in the\r\nnew ground an’ gettin’ out stumps an’ all that, an’ if there was a boy\r\nor man in that settlement that could beat me breakin’ in a colt or hold\r\na hand with me in a wrestlin’ match, I don’t remember it jis’ now. We\r\nhad one holiday an’ that was Sunday afternoons, which we spent mostly in\r\nbreakin’ in of colts. Wal, one Sunday we struck the meanest-tempered colt\r\nthat ever come down the pike. He flung Bill, an’ he flung Jim, an’ then\r\nhe flung the old man hisse’f. They was all older than me, of course, an’\r\nwhen he flung the old man it made him bilin’ hot an’ he sez: ‘Dam sech a\r\ncolt es that! I’ll give ennybody a dollar that will stay on his back a\r\nminnit!’\r\n\r\n“Then I up an’ sez to the old man: ‘Pap, do you mean that?’\r\n\r\n“‘I do,’ sez he, most emphatically.\r\n\r\n“‘Then,’ sez I, ‘that dollar is mine.’\r\n\r\n“Now, in them days colts wan’t broke till they was fo’ years old, an’\r\nthis particular colt had been raised with the mules in the cane bottoms.\r\nI got Bill to hold him with a twister till I got on, an’ they turned him\r\nloose. He give three buckjumps, one right after the other, but I had\r\nlocked my long legs around him, and he might as well have tried to throw\r\noff the saddle. When he saw he couldn’t fling me he bolted an’ took up\r\nthe pike like wild. He run under trees an’ through bushes, he jumped rock\r\nfences, he scraped trees and jumped ditches, an’ I let him go. He run up\r\nthe road five miles to Blivens’ mill, then he got skeered at a goat in\r\nthe road, bolted ag’in and run back home. I calk’lated he run jes’ ten\r\nmiles back to the barn lot he started frum, an’ when he cleared the last\r\nfence I turned loose my grip an’ turned a summerset over his head in ten\r\nyards of whar we started. I was sorter dazed at first, but when I came to\r\nthe old man was standin’ over me sorter smilin’ an’ he sed: ‘Hiram, my\r\nson, here’s yo’ dollar; you’ve been on just a minnit!’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was nearly midnight when the big lamps were lighted. They were placed\r\non the prow of the canoe, so that their rays crossed in the river, each\r\nlamp lighting its opposite side. I knew that the old hunter knew every\r\nshoal and log in the river and that no man could guide a boat or shoot\r\nquicker or more accurately than John Jackson. So I had no fears of\r\ncapsizing, and when I took my Ithaca and sat down behind the lights, I\r\nwas in such a glow of excitement that I did not need my overcoat. And\r\nthat excitement never left me. The boat glided out and a weird and yet\r\nfascinating scene presented itself. We sat in midnight darkness, but for\r\nfifty yards ahead of us the river was bright with the glare of the big\r\nreflectors. It penetrated the woods on either side and I felt something\r\nawesome in the feeling that we were uncovering the hidden secrets of\r\nnature, peering into the midnight heart, laying bare her shrouded woods\r\nand dark waters and stabbing her silence and her solitude with a knife of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nNot a word was to be spoken. Everything went by a code of signals. If\r\nJackson put out his right hand, the boat moved to the right—his left\r\nhand, to the left. One’s heart beats fast and the blood runs hot, for as\r\nhe peers into the midnight darkness and sees the white light creeping\r\nover the woods and the waters, he expects every minute to see the\r\ngraceful necks and white outspread banners of a flock of geese fall into\r\nits penetrating circle.\r\n\r\nThere was a splash in the water to the left. It was a beaver. A swift\r\nobject moved across the prow of the canoe, cutting the water into ripples\r\nas it hurried to the shore. It was a muskrat. A half mile farther I\r\nalmost laughed out at the queer antics of Br’er Coon when the big lights\r\ncaught him square in the eyes as he sat fishing for earth worms on the\r\nbank. He blinked, and winked, and turned his head in a quizzical way as\r\nif wondering what that animal with the sun-eyes was floating down the\r\nstream. We left him standing on the bank winking, and blinking, and too\r\nworthless for us to startle our game with an unnecessary report.\r\n\r\nIt is the unexpected, of course, that happens, and it came a half-mile\r\nfarther down and out the top of a dead tree lying in the river. They\r\narose with a whirr and whistle of wings and clatter, almost under our\r\nprow, that I scarcely had time to prepare. Besides, in the light they\r\nappeared pure white and of great size. Instead of flying away they flew\r\nstraight at our lights, for they were blinded, and the Old Hunter said\r\nI dodged to keep from being hit. Anyway, I managed to fire once as they\r\npassed over me. Then I heard the old man’s gun roar in my ears and two\r\nbig mallards fell almost in our boat.\r\n\r\n“Did I hit anything?” I asked him.\r\n\r\nHe laughed.\r\n\r\n“You shot all the tail feathers out of the duck I killed!” he said.\r\n“Phe—w—! listen! Throw the oil cloth over the lights,” he whispered.\r\n\r\nI did, and we sat in the middle of the river in pitch darkness. Our shots\r\nhad flushed a big flock of geese. They made a tremendous clatter as they\r\narose from the waters, not two hundred yards ahead of us. They were\r\nflying wildly about down the river.\r\n\r\n“That’s unlucky,” said the old hunter. “In a few minutes we would have\r\nhad them.”\r\n\r\nIt was an hour before we had them again—at least twenty beautiful fellows\r\nthat flashed into our circle of light. The sight of a flock of geese on\r\nthe water at night is the most beautiful and thrilling sight I ever saw.\r\nIn the air they are long-necked, awkward things, but in the water they\r\nare the personification of grace and beauty. They ride the waves like a\r\nswan, their necks grandly arched and the big band of white under their\r\ntails is raised and spread like a white banner in the light. At sight of\r\nthese not a word was said, as the old hunter moved silently up to them\r\nand began the process called huddling them. It took us five minutes to do\r\nthis, and all the time I sat with my gun on them and my heart thumping\r\nlike a racer’s in the back stretch. At last three heads crossed in a\r\nline. I saw Jackson’s gun in front of me leap to his shoulder, and I\r\nfired. They arose with konks and screams and for half a minute every gun\r\nturned on them in the air. Then silence and darkness, for the suction of\r\nthe discharges had put out our lights... And then!—well, we merely fell\r\nout of the canoe! for just in the shadow of our lights a flock arose with\r\na noise and splash that set the boat rocking on the waves.\r\n\r\n“Bad luck again,” said the old hunter, as he rowed up to and picked up\r\nthe eight beauties. “We run into the sentry. We’d killed a dozen if we’d\r\nonly waited.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, while a thrill of genuine sportsman joy tingled me to the\r\nfingers; “but one doesn’t want to be a hog! This is enough for one night.\r\nLet’s go back to camp.”\r\n\r\n                                                                 TROTWOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHRISTMAS FOX HUNT IN ALABAMA.\r\n\r\nBY JOHN HENRY WALLACE, JR.\r\n\r\n’Twas the Christmas season and the air was soft and balmy, sweet with the\r\nfragrance of the soft southerly winds.\r\n\r\nThe next day, much to our delight, promised to dawn bright and clear.\r\nColonel Malcolm Gilchrist, of Courtland, and Major Otis Hennigan, of\r\nLeighton, had done me the honor to be my guests at “Kittikaskia,” my\r\nhome, and to bring along their superb packs of hounds, it being our\r\nintention to go in quest of “Old Blaze,” a big red fox that lived in the\r\nJarman fields four miles to the west. This crafty red had for several\r\nyears eluded hunters and hounds by seeking refuge in the caves of the\r\nTennessee River hills, but we had planned for the morrow a scheme to\r\nchange his course, and to put him on his mettle to outstrip the hounds,\r\nor else succumb in the brave attempt.\r\n\r\n“Old Blaze” always ran through the same stand on his unerring way to\r\nthe river hills, and so, in anticipation of this, we had secured half a\r\nhundred dusky denizens of the cotton fields to go to his crossing, form a\r\nline, and yell after the lusty manner of their kind, when they heard the\r\nhounds coming. We believed that the bedlam they would raise would divert\r\nthe fox from his beaten track, and turn him toward a level, open country,\r\nwhere the chase could be followed with ease, seen and enjoyed.\r\n\r\nIt was an eager anticipation of sport most glorious that infused our\r\nhearts with happiness as we donned our hunting regalia that eventful morn.\r\n\r\nThe South is the natural home of the true fox hunter. The lords and\r\nladies of the British Isles who came to this country settled along the\r\nAtlantic Coast. And as westward the star of empire wended its unrelenting\r\nway, their posterity cut through the forest and founded here a happy,\r\na peaceful and a prosperous land—where oftentimes one man’s estate\r\nrivals in area and grandeur a modern principality. Descended from these\r\ngrandees who brought to America the best strains of race horses, hounds\r\nand gamecocks, the sport-loving fraternity of Dixieland still retain in\r\ntheir pristine purity the same strains their noble ancestors Imported and\r\nloved.\r\n\r\nThe Southern fox-hunter loves his hounds. He enjoys seeing the\r\nindividuals of his pack race together. And we were to see tested the\r\nspeed and endurance of the prides of our respective packs—Colonel\r\nGilchrist’s “Fashion,” Major Hennigan’s “Prompter,” and the writer’s\r\n“Alice.” Three faster and gamer hounds were never before matched in\r\nAlabama (and the fastest and gamest hounds on earth are here), and the\r\ncoming struggle for victory was intensified most thrillingly by our\r\nnatural love for the hunt.\r\n\r\nAs we rode toward the foxes’ rendezvous, o’er the distant hills frolicked\r\nthe resonant tones of the hunter’s horn, its plaintive notes awakening\r\nthe sleeping echoes that set the woodland dells ringing with the sweetest\r\nof mellow music.\r\n\r\nThe shafts of the new-born day quivered high in the heavens, as the\r\nstars one by one paled of silvery lustre as the sun kindled the eastern\r\nforests with flames that swept and glowed away the dawn. The hunters were\r\nsplendidly mounted, and their horses bounded away with a spirit that\r\nthrilled the hearts of the riders, for oft before had they been ridden\r\nin the chase, and each horse seemed instinctively to know that excellent\r\nsport was ahead. The frost sparkled on the Bermuda, bespangling it with\r\ntiny icy prisms, while not a cloud in the heavens marred the perfect\r\nglory of an ideal hunting morn.\r\n\r\nThe hounds were held in check until the vicinity of the foxes’ lair had\r\nbeen reached, when the hunting signals were given to forty fearless\r\nhounds that eagerly bounded away to search field and fell for traces\r\nof Sir Reynard. The course was directed up the ivy-bedecked banks of\r\nKittikaskia, whose clear waters flow into those of the murkier Tennessee.\r\nSoon the course was changed toward the Jarman fields and “Morgan,” the\r\nNestor of the packs, sounded the first tocsin of game. Singly, and in\r\npairs, the hounds chimed in, for they knew that Morgan never cried a\r\nfalse track, and all confidently and diligently worked to solve the\r\nproblem of a very cold and indifferent scent. Now all the hounds join in,\r\nthe scent grows warmer, and Prompter has given tongue. When he cries the\r\ntrail, the fox is sure to be rousted.\r\n\r\nThen, like the notes of a single instrument swelling into the magnificent\r\ncrescendo of a grand orchestra, the hounds jumped the fox from his mossy\r\nlair and sped away in swift pursuit, filling the hills and hollows with\r\nmusic, wild yet thrillingly in tune. Fond of detouring the level fields\r\nbefore his jaunt to the river hills, and proud of his fleetness of foot,\r\nthe spirited red began an elaborate journey by leaving the woods and\r\nswinging out into the plantations, now vocal with the anthems of the\r\nhappy darkies, whose sweet songs of contentment are cadences to the time\r\nto which they gather the snowy cotton.\r\n\r\nWe rode to the yelping pack, each steed seeming eager to outstrip the\r\nfield. With nostrils red, steaming and distended, eyes dilated and\r\nflashing wicked fire, they bear their riders to the density of the\r\nthickening cry. The world seems vibrant with the music of the cascades\r\nof glorious enthusiasm, and hunters are oblivious to all save the\r\ninspiration of the matchless moment. We are now within easy view of the\r\nrunning pack, that dashed high into the air the melting frost which\r\ndescended like a shower of diamond sparks, while Alice—game little hound,\r\nher wild-goose notes pealing out far above the unbroken cry—led the pack\r\nat a killing pace. Fashion was at her flank, with Prompter not a length\r\nbehind, and across the valley’s fertile expanse the race for victory\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n“Go on, Fashion!” yelled Colonel Gilchrist, tiptoeing in his stirrups,\r\nhis hat off. She heard and heeded his shout of encouragement and\r\ngradually lessened the lead of Alice. But Alice, long an invincible\r\nleader, was not to be vanquished without a desperate struggle. The main\r\npack was spread out like an open fan. A blanket could have covered the\r\nthirty-seven demons that raced together to be the first to cry the\r\nburning scent that crazes the brains of the hounds, and converts them\r\ninto yelping, frenzied fiends.\r\n\r\nThe fox and hounds entered a strip of woods and for the moment are lost\r\nto view. A meadow was being crossed and Fashion, like a dart from an\r\nIndian’s ashen bow, flashed up to Alice, and Colonel Gilchrist set up\r\na yell that seemed to split the azure dome of the sky. Prompter had\r\nfallen back and was running with the pack. The course of the fox was now\r\ndirected towards the river. The chase was one hour old, and hard pressed\r\nin open country, he would seek refuge in the crags and cliffs that\r\noverhang the beautiful, the picturesque, the turbulent Mussel Shoals.\r\n\r\n“Follow me and see the fox!” I shouted, and dashed away, followed by the\r\nother hunters to a stand where the fox was sure to cross. We reached the\r\nplace not a moment too soon, for Sir Reynard, with long, poetic leaps,\r\ncame splitting down the vale. His head was held defiantly in the air,\r\nhis handsome amber brush was carried proudly high. Like a red streak he\r\nflashed into the woods and was lost to view in its density. The hunters\r\nremained silent until the hounds had passed. They were heard coming fast\r\nbehind, like a maddened musical avalanche, with Alice leading Fashion by\r\nseveral lengths. While Fashion continued the valiant fight for supremacy,\r\nher slender black neck, ringed with white, elevated, her shapely head\r\nwas thrown back like the antlers of a frightened deer, dashing from the\r\nhunter’s snare to sweet security. All the hounds but Scott’s were well\r\npacked.\r\n\r\nAway speed the hunters! Faster fly the hounds.\r\n\r\nAt once there arose so wild a yell,\r\n\r\n    “As if all the fiends from heaven that fell\r\n    Had pealed the banner cry of hell.”\r\n\r\nThe fox was approaching the crossing to the river. The negroes on guard\r\nhad heard the hounds coming and were endeavoring to turn him back.\r\n\r\nOld Blaze was terrified at the outcry, and swerved to the right and\r\nsought safety by endeavoring to show to the pack a burst of speed that\r\nwould soon place him so far ahead as to leave behind only a very cold\r\ntrail. But the hounds were equal to the emergency, and turned with the\r\nfox without a momentary bobble, and back to the Jarman fields proceeded\r\nthe electrifying march, “full cry” being rendered by the grandest of\r\nmusicians, whose music has inspired kings and peasants alike, infused\r\nthem with nobler ambitions and attuned their hearts and primed their\r\nsouls to the songs caroled by angel voices. Prompter has left the pack\r\nand now challenges Alice and Fashion. It becomes indeed a killing race\r\nfor victory.\r\n\r\nThe chase is now two hours old. The fox found that he could not outstrip\r\nthe pack. His revengeful pursuers could not be evaded by swift running\r\ntactics, for the air was damp and still, and he left behind him a\r\nscorching trail. One hope only now remained for him—he must make for\r\nthe river hills, or else succumb. The fox on his circle back toward the\r\nriver ran two miles west of where he had formerly tried to cross, and\r\nere long the chase was on the bluff overlooking the river, whose broad\r\nexpanse was dotted here and there with islets that seemed to float like\r\ngraceful gondolas of green, and each echoed the notes of the hounds and,\r\naltogether, sounded like a hundred packs running in the river. Alice\r\nstill maintained the lead. As the hounds dashed down a steep declivity,\r\nin sight of all, she is seen to strike her shoulder against a cruel\r\nprojecting rock that causes her to tumble. She quickly got up and made an\r\neffort to follow the track, but her shoulder refuses to respond to her\r\nwill and her foot hangs limp—her shoulder was broken. On three legs she\r\nfollows far behind, crying the scent.\r\n\r\nI hastily dismounted and caught her in my arms, giving rein to my\r\nmount. I was determined that she should see the finish, she who was so\r\nunfortunately deterred from brilliantly winning.\r\n\r\nIt is two miles to where the fox intends to go to earth. Fashion is\r\ncrying the lead not sixty yards behind the quarry. The pack, with flaming\r\ntongues, is just behind, giving vent to short, defiant yelps. My horse is\r\nintensely excited and determined to outstrip the hunting field.\r\n\r\nHo! hear that defiant, agonized cry!\r\n\r\nIt is a sight race!\r\n\r\nThe hounds see the fox. His requiem is being sounded at every note. The\r\nfox is within a few hundred yards of his place of safety. The hounds seem\r\nto know it, and are running with an inspiration that means death to the\r\nfox. Little Alice in my arms cried pitifully and struggled tenaciously\r\nto be released, that she might endeavor to go to the vortex of the\r\nrevengeful cry.\r\n\r\nThe hounds are closing in on the fox, and the splendid red turns toward\r\nhis frantic pursuers, and rushes into the steel-hinged jaws of Fashion,\r\nmeeting death as only the courageous die—facing it without a murmur.\r\nPrompter is the next hound to catch the fox, and soon his destruction is\r\ncomplete. In the midst of great delight, there is passing regret, for we\r\ndeplore the fact that a creature so graceful, so noble, so courageous\r\nshould forfeit his life after the splendid sport he had afforded us on\r\nthat grand December morning.\r\n\r\nHuntsville, Ala.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArbitration.\r\n\r\n    Let us have peace.—_Gen.

It appears that some horses are and some are not, if\r\nthe statements of various persons interested be true. An old soldier, who\r\nwas a colonel in the big fight, once told me that in a close place he\r\nrode his horse in the Tennessee River, hoping to swim across. The animal\r\nnever struck a lick at swimming, but simply waded in until it committed\r\nsuicide, and but for the timely arrival of a friend in a canoe, the rider\r\nwould have drowned also. On the other hand, it is an historical fact\r\nthat Weatherford, the Indian chief whom Jackson defeated and captured in\r\nthe Creek War, and who always rode a gray horse which was at least half\r\nthoroughbred, when surrounded by soldiers and crowded to a big bluff on\r\nthe Alabama River, took a running start, drove the spurs into his horse,\r\nwho jumped off a bluff fully twenty feet high, into the river. Horse and\r\nrider went out of sight, but rose again and struck out, the chief still\r\non his back, to the distant bank. So daring and brave was the act that\r\nJackson’s soldiers would not shoot at them, but let them escape into the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nThere is one horse in Tennessee that I will make affidavit to the fact\r\nthat he is a swimmer, as well as a lightning pacer. It is Brown Hal Jr.\r\n2:10¼.\r\n\r\nOn Good Friday, 1902, the heavens simply opened on the South. Never has\r\nsuch a flood been heard of—at least since Noah’s day. Creeks became\r\nsurging rivers, rivers vast lakes of water rushing seaward. Mr. Robt.\r\nHutton, one of the owners of Brown Hal Jr. 2:10¼, writes that that game\r\nson of the old horse was in a large stable, in which a half dozen mules\r\nwere also confined on the creek near the town. Mr. Hutton is a banker and\r\nwas busy in his bank. The cloudburst came so suddenly that people indoors\r\ndid not appreciate the extent of the downfall of rain.\r\n\r\n“Is there anything in your barn, Bob,” asked a friend as he stuck his\r\nhead in the door. “I see it is about to float away.”\r\n\r\n“I should say there is,” he said, as he started on a run for the barn. A\r\nboat was procured and the door finally reached, when the gallant horse\r\nwas found swimming around for his life and doubtless wondering why he had\r\nbeen shut up to drown. Once out he left no doubt of his ability to breast\r\na flood.\r\n\r\nBut talking of the flood, I suspect I will have to make affidavit to\r\nthis, but unless several friends in whose word I have the greatest\r\nconfidence have prevaricated, I am willing to do so. Down in Giles, where\r\nit seems everything happens now and then, Col. Martin Houston, of near\r\nPulaski, had two lovely asses of the Mockingbird breed. These wandered\r\nby day in a delightful paddock in Richland Creek, and at night sang in\r\nbasso profundo to the listening lady loves. The floods came and Richland\r\nCreek became a Mississippi, and before the festal asses could consult the\r\nweather bureau at Nashville (which, by the way, I will solemnly swear\r\npublished it the day before that it would be “cold and fair,” the next\r\nday), these two Romeos went floating away on the deep, with nowhere to\r\nlay their heads. Colonel Martin grieved sorely, for they were worth many\r\nshekels while the South African war was on. After the floods subsided\r\nColonel Martin went out to examine things, and down the creek, a mile or\r\nso, high up in the top of a tall sycamore tree, hung one of his Romeos,\r\nalive and kicking. Ropes were got and neighbors came. The tree was tied\r\non four sides, then cut in two, at the base, and gradually lowered until\r\nthe animal was released sound and all right. Now, the above is vouched\r\nfor by many citizens, but what became of the other ass I am unwilling\r\nto publish over my own signature, as I have some respect even for the\r\nreputation of a maker of rhymes. I clip this from the Nashville Banner of\r\nApril 23:\r\n\r\nColumbia, April 23.—An unusual story comes from Glendale of the\r\nendurance of a jack. Two of these animals were in pasture on the banks of\r\nFountain Creek, at the time of the big flood three weeks since, and were\r\nswept away. The body of one of them was found, but nothing was heard of\r\nthe other one till last Friday, when, it is said, some workmen found him\r\nburied in a sandbar with only his head out, still alive.\r\n\r\nSpades were secured and the animal exhumed, when, so the story goes, he\r\nate food offered him and lived till Saturday, when he died as the result\r\nof over-indulgence after the long fast.\r\n\r\n\r\nPat Connolly and the Snakes.\r\n\r\nHere is Conductor Pat Connolly’s experience as he related himself.\r\nConductor Connolly is an Irishman and hates snakes now worse than ever.\r\n\r\n“When my train reached the creek at Wales Station, faith I never seen\r\nsich a flood. The track was gone—washed away for twenty yards or more,\r\nand the water over everything else. I walked out on the track ahead of\r\nthe engine to see her sweep by—me an’ Jim Tally, the fireman, when I\r\nfelt the cross-ties I was on turn over and I went with ’em. The water\r\nhad washed the track and embankment up that we stood on, so sudden we\r\nnever knowed it, an’ me an’ Jim was jus’ washed along in the flood. It\r\nwas aisy swimmin’ for we just scooted along like a mill-race, an’ by an’\r\nby when I passed a big sycamore with its top just out, I hung on an’\r\nclambered up. Jim followed an’ we set there on a limb, way up in the top,\r\nwith our legs in the water. We was feelin’ pretty good an’ comfort’ble\r\ntill our company came. I felt something wrop round my leg—faith, it was\r\na snake. They simply hung to every limb of that tree. They was there by\r\nthe hundreds, all kinds an’ conditions of ’em. I went up to the top notch\r\nan’ Jim after me. I never stopped to dispute the pint with ’em, as to who\r\nwas entitled to the lower limbs. They seemed to have got there fust an’ I\r\ngave ’em the benefit of the doubt, anyway. They hissed and wiggled around\r\nan’ looked meaner than original sin. I never seen as many snakes in my\r\nlife. Night came on, but the moon rose up an’ we could see everything\r\nplain. The water was rising a foot an hour, an’ Jim an’ me put up some\r\nsilent prayer that it wouldn’t get over that treetop. Well, sah, about\r\nten o’clock we seen something that made our hair rise. It was a dead\r\nnigger floatin’ round that tree dressed in a long, white robe. He floated\r\nunder my limb and gazed up at me, an’ I’ll swear I nearly fell off my\r\nperch. Then here come another, an’ another—nigger babies, old niggers,\r\nmammies, young niggers—dozens of ’em; some in coffins and some out. None\r\nof ’em didn’t wanter go by that tree, but just floated around an’ around\r\nan’ grinned at me an’ Jim. We didn’t kno’ then, of course, what it was,\r\nbut we learned afterwards the high water had washed up a nigger graveyard\r\nabout three miles above. It was midnight before they got a boat from\r\nPulaski and took us down. I had lost forty pounds, an’ Jim’s hair was as\r\nwhite as snow.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIndian Graves.\r\n\r\nThe above sounds fishy, but it was the actual experience of Conductor Pat\r\nConnolly. But a stranger thing happened than the washing up of the negro\r\ngraveyard, and one which is greatly interesting the Tennessee Historical\r\nSociety. At a little station a few miles below Pulaski, in Giles County,\r\nthere is a very rich field which old men know has been cultivated for\r\nseventy-five years. Nor was the water ever known to rise over it before.\r\nBefore it was known to the ploughshare, it was a great forest, covered\r\nwith trees of great age, many of them there when De Soto’s Spaniards\r\nmarched through in the sixteenth century. Last month I went down into\r\nthat county to hunt squirrels, and as we rested in the woods, turned into\r\nbouquets by blooming dogwood and red-buds, to eat our noon lunch by a\r\nbig, cool spring, Mr. Bob Brannon, of Lynnville, who was in our party of\r\nhunters, told me this incident.\r\n\r\n“When the waters subsided over this field,” said Mr. Brannon, “the\r\ncurrent at one place had taken off two feet or more of soil, and there\r\nfully exposed as if laid bare by hand, was a burial ground of some\r\nancient people. The tombs had been nicely built of slabs of rocks,\r\nenclosing the body, of which a number were found, some of them as\r\nperfect skeletons as I ever saw. Infants lay side by side with father and\r\nmother and how long they had slept there only the Great Father knows,\r\nfor not a descendant of this ancient race now lives on the earth, every\r\nvestige of its cultivation has passed away and forest trees, centuries\r\nold, have grown over their graves, which might have slumbered on till\r\neternity but for the flood. I handled the skulls and bones, but I felt as\r\nif I was touching sacred things, relics of civilization older than any we\r\nknow of.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Week After that Flood.\r\n\r\nThis started John W. Alexander, the Lynnville druggist and horseman, and\r\nthe present owner of Brown Hal, Jr., He had been eating a currant pie\r\nand stopped long enough to say: “My flood yarn is the greatest thing\r\nthat I ever heard of. An old man—a good, honest, but poor farmer—has\r\nbeen tilling a hillside field three miles above Lynnville for years. The\r\nweek after that flood, while plowing in the hillside, suddenly, without\r\nany warning, his team and plow disappeared in the furrow ahead of him.\r\nThe man stopped and found that he stood on the brink of a hole that had\r\nsuddenly opened in the earth and taken his team in. Peering down he saw\r\nhis poor horses, piled on one another fully twenty feet below. They were\r\ngroaning and calling pitifully for him to help them, but in a half hour\r\ntheir groans ceased and they were dead. The explanation is simple: The\r\nheavy rains had cut out a sink hole in a few feet of the surface, which\r\nbroke under the weight of the team. We raised, by public subscription,\r\nenough money to buy him another team.”\r\n\r\nBy this time, Geo. Campbell Brown, of Ewell Farm, had eaten the other\r\npie. “Do you all know old man Simpson, of Richland Creek?” he asked\r\ninnocently. We all knew him.\r\n\r\n“Well, you know, he was drowned in that flood while trying to drive some\r\ncolts out of the bottom lands before the water was too high. His wife\r\ntold him not to go into that swamp, but you never heard of a man taking\r\nhis wife’s advice when it comes to horses, so he was drowned, and went on\r\nto a better land. He hadn’t more than arrived before he was telling it to\r\nlistening crowds what a terrible flood they had in Tennessee and how old\r\nRichland Creek spread all over the state of Giles. Finally he went on and\r\ntold about Pat Connolly and the snake, the jackass tale, and the Indian\r\ngraveyard and all that, and closed by telling that Richland Creek was\r\ntwenty feet higher than the high-water mark of 1834, registered on the\r\nold elm at Possum Bend School House. When he said this he noticed an old,\r\ngray-headed man turn up his nose disdainfully and walk off without saying\r\na word.\r\n\r\n“‘Why, that old man seems offended,’ said Simpson—‘who is he?’\r\n\r\n“‘Why, don’t you know him?’ said a listener—‘that’s Noah!’”\r\n\r\n“I think it is time for the squirrels to begin to come out again,” I\r\nsaid, as I picked up my gun and started into the woods.\r\n\r\n                                                                 TROTWOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Postponed Christmas Dinner.\r\n\r\nDecember, 1863, the night before Christmas (the time above all others\r\nwhen our thoughts were of home), found the Seventh Ohio Cavalry on\r\noutpost duty closely observing the veteran army of General Longstreet,\r\nthen in upper East Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas dinner was by no means ready for either the Confederate or\r\nthe Union troops in East Tennessee, as both armies were then living off\r\nthe country, which had long before been denuded of almost every edible\r\nthing suitable for man or beast. The veteran cavalrymen of our regiment\r\nwere sharing their exceedingly light rations with their horses, five\r\nnubbins of corn per day for each man and his horse being the scanty\r\nallowance from our limited supplies.\r\n\r\nUnder this circumstance, it was necessary to postpone our Christmas\r\ndinner until February following. By this time Longstreet had retired from\r\nEast Tennessee to rejoin General Lee’s Army preparatory to the campaign\r\nin Virginia against General Grant.\r\n\r\nIn February we found ourselves relieved from duty in close proximity to\r\nthe enemy, and in order to recuperate our men and horses took station in\r\nTuckaleechee Cove, at the base of the Great Smoky Mountains, south of\r\nKnoxville, near the North Carolina line.\r\n\r\nHere there was fairly good grazing for our horses and moderately good\r\nforaging opportunities for the men. It was here, and in the month of\r\nFebruary, that we had our Christmas dinner. Somewhere and somehow (it was\r\nnot for me to know or to ask) our mess had secured a turkey, maybe a wild\r\none which had been killed in trying to bite some of our boys, and under\r\nthe skillful hands of Private Sam Wood, of Company I, the most expert\r\ncook in the regiment, this turkey was roasted over a fire of live coals,\r\nwhich Sam, with the utmost care, had prepared and arranged. The turkey\r\nwas suspended from a rigging of poles at the proper distance from the\r\nfire and by the dexterous hand of Sam was kept gently turning around and\r\naround, that the roasting process might properly proceed. Out of the sky\r\nhad dropped a mess of sweet potatoes, along with some pickled cabbage,\r\nmuch like sauerkraut, which went to complete our Christmas dinner. Our\r\nmess, composed of the colonel, the surgeon and the adjutant, sat close\r\nby to watch proceedings, and to “shoo away” self-invited guests who had\r\nbeen attracted to our camp fire by the aroma of the roasting turkey, and\r\nincidentally to frequently wipe our watering mouths and ask Sam if he\r\ncould not hurry matters along a little faster, as we had our appetites\r\nwith us. It seemed to us hungry souls that never before did it take so\r\nlong to roast a turkey.\r\n\r\nAs we were nearing the completion of the repast a little rain storm\r\npassed over, but soon the sun shone brightly, showing the tops of the\r\nmountains tipped with snow. We were all in a frame of mind to enjoy\r\nthis beautiful but fleeting scene, when Sam, the cook, pointing to the\r\nsnow-capped mountains, said, “Gentlemen, there is ice cream for dessert,\r\nhelp yourselves.”\r\n\r\nAs I look back now through the vista of more than forty years, never\r\nbefore or since did a Christmas dinner taste so good as that one of\r\nturkey, sweet potatoes and sauerkraut, all topped off with ice cream on\r\nthe mountains!\r\n\r\n                                                        THEODORE F. ALLEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Devil’s Wagon.\r\n\r\nIt was plain from the old man’s demeanor that he was “up against”\r\nsomething unusual.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter now,” I asked; “did you lose out in the crap game, or\r\nhas Taylor sent for you?”\r\n\r\nTaylor is Judge of the Criminal Court, and, according to Uncle Jake, when\r\nany colored citizen is guilty of an offence against the peace and dignity\r\nof the State, Taylor very promptly sends for him.\r\n\r\nUncle Jake, however, is a leading member of Bethel church, and prides\r\nhimself on his ability to keep out of scraps which are likely to involve\r\nhim in trouble with Taylor.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily the old man would have answered my banter good-humoredly; as\r\nit was he only shook his head and sighed. It was evident that he had had\r\na very extraordinary experience. I continued, however, in my same tone:\r\n“Oh, you’d as well tell me; I haven’t ever refused to go on your bond,\r\nhave I?”\r\n\r\n“Has I ever axed yer ter go on my bon’? Naw, sah, an de nex’ time yer\r\nhear frum me I ain’t axin yer nuther, case I ain’t aimin’ ter git inter\r\nnothin’ to need no bon’.”\r\n\r\nThe old man was plainly in no joking humor. So I said, “Well, tell me\r\nabout it anyway; you surely haven’t got into anything you’re ashamed of,\r\nhave you?”\r\n\r\n“Naw, sah, I ain’t,” he answered, very positively. “Naw, sah, I ain’t,\r\ncase I’m plum dead shore ef I’der had my sayso erbout hit, hit never der\r\nhappened. Yer see hit ’us dis er way: De yuther night atter I’d et my\r\nsupper I saddled up my little ole mule, Jack, and started to de sto’.\r\nWhen I’d got up on de yuther side er de creek, all ’twonst I seed er\r\nlight flare up ergin de telephone wires, en fore I had time ter think\r\nerbout enything tall, dar come ober de rise de awfullest lookin’ thing I\r\neber seed in my life.”\r\n\r\n“What did it look like?”\r\n\r\n“Well, sah, de best I can tell yer, hit looked like er great, monstros\r\ninseck, wid eyes er flah as big as the head uv er sugar bar’l, an’ jest\r\ner comin’ er gittin’. I say, ‘Jack, I specks we’d better be goin’ back.’\r\nWell, we started back, Jack er doin’ his levelin bes’, but shucks!\r\nt’wawnt narry biter use; that thing jes crope right up on us like we’d\r\ner bin stanin’ still. And all de time I could hear it sayin’ right fas’\r\nlike hit meant it, ‘Gittin’, gittin’, gittin’, gittin’. Purty quick Jack,\r\nhe seed ’twant no use ter try ter git erway, en jest stopped an’ turned\r\n’round facin’ the thing.

I looked er\r\n’roun’ sorter kurful like, en bless Gracious! hit wan’t no man.”\r\n\r\n“Wan’t no man!” I exclaimed in feigned surprise, “what was it?”\r\n\r\n“Ay Lawd, don’t ax me, case I don’t know.

BREWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nJim and the Old Pacer.\r\n\r\nIt’s a cold day, indeed, when a drummer has not got a good yarn up his\r\ncoat-sleeve, and the narrator of this swears to its truth in every\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nWe were sitting around a good fire the other evening when the subject of\r\nlast winter’s cold spell came up and how much fun the boys over the line\r\nwere having on the path; and, incidentally, how greatly the interest in\r\nsnow races among gentlemen drivers was increasing each winter.\r\n\r\n“But, say,” said the drummer, who was selling cigars and had just passed\r\naround some to sample, “talking about the fun the boys had up North on\r\nthe snow last winter reminds me how a farmer and an old pacer, up in a\r\nfashionable little town in the State of York, where I happened to be last\r\nmonth, hit the snow enthusiasm of that class of fellows who thought they\r\nowned the best snow horse in the world with a blizzard that will cool\r\nthem off till the spring time comes, gentle Annie. At least, they hadn’t\r\ngot over it when I left two weeks ago,” he laughed. “We didn’t have any\r\nsnow until after Christmas, and when the cold wave, with snow, did come,\r\nyou bet they were all waiting for it. Fellows with fine sleighs bought in\r\nOctober and put in the carriage house began to think they would have to\r\nwait another year, while the trotters and pacers were eating their heads\r\noff, and hundreds of friendly wagers lay in pigeon holes, waiting for\r\nthe snow. Well, when it came, it was a dandy, and the snow path soon saw\r\ndozens of races a day, with fine rigs and fun galore.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got a driver friend who lives near the big town mentioned—runs a\r\ntraining stable in the suburbs. You’d know him in a minute if I’d call\r\nhis name, for he has driven many a good one to victory, and he’s got a\r\npacer you’d know, too, for he has a mark below 2:12. But this pacer is an\r\nonery-looking thing, if I ever saw one. He wouldn’t sell on his looks\r\nfor fifteen dollars, yet he won thirty-five hundred dollars last year\r\nclear of expenses. My friend bought him out of a log-wagon—a curby-legged\r\nthing, with log spavins and splints in swarms, but gee whiz, how he could\r\npace! Jim—that’s my friend’s name—loves a little fun about as well as\r\nanybody. He didn’t go out on the snow path the first week until he found\r\nout just who could go and how fast, and then he just laid for the whole\r\ngang with that old pacer. The boys drove out to his stable time and again\r\nand bantered him, guyed him, made fun of him and all that, but he laid\r\nlow and said nothing. One evening he sent for me and whispered:\r\n\r\n“‘Want to make your winter oats tomorrow?’\r\n\r\n“‘I don’t care,’ I laughed, ‘if it’s a dead sure thing. Haven’t got any\r\nmoney to burn up in an experiment.’\r\n\r\n“Jim laughed and handed me a hundred in ten-dollar bills. ‘This shows my\r\nfaith; play it for me on the farmer and the old pacer to-morrow, any way\r\nor odds you want to, and if you don’t make some yourself while you’re at\r\nit, why, it’s your own fault.’ And then he took me in the harness room\r\nand told me a little tale that made me laugh all over.\r\n\r\n“Well, to-morrow meant there was going to be several races on the snow,\r\nand all the fashionable end of town was to be out. One or two fellows\r\nwith pretty good horses had beat everything and were looking for more\r\nworlds to conquer. Just after dinner Jim put on snow goggles, a hayseed\r\nhat, the rustiest coat he could borrow, clapped that curby-legged pacer\r\nin an old sleigh that looked like it had stood up in a mouldy carriage\r\nhouse for fifty years, with harness to match, put a few bundles of oats,\r\nfarmer like, in behind to save feed, of course, in town, and jogged on in\r\nwith a sort of an ain’t-been-to-town-for-ten-years look written all over\r\nthe whole turnout.\r\n\r\n“He wasn’t looking for the first suckers he did up, though. He heard\r\na jingling of bells behind him some two miles out, and came very near\r\nbeing run over by a happy lot of young fellows with their girls on a\r\nbob-sleigh, drawn by four spanking horses. The fun they had over Jim\r\nand his queer turnout was immense—for about five minutes. They dashed\r\nup beside him, asked him the price of oats, and all that and finally\r\nhollered out:\r\n\r\n“‘Get out of the road, old man, or we’ll run over you!’\r\n\r\n“‘But I be goin’ to town, too,’ Jim drawled out in the nasalest twang\r\nthat ever came out of a down-easter’s nose. Then he shook up the old\r\npacer just enough to stay tantalisingly in front in spite of everything\r\nthey could do. The bob-sleigh crowd couldn’t go in six minutes at a trot\r\nto save their necks, so they put the teams out in full run, but that was\r\njust fun for the old pacer. They never came in twenty yards of his oats\r\nin the rear of the sleigh. After teasing the babies enough, Jim turned at\r\nthe first good stretch, looked back, winked his off eye, and said: ‘Yes,\r\nchillun, I be goin’ to town, too, so good-bye to you babies, an’ heaven\r\nbless you,’ and he shot away and left them.\r\n\r\n“You have heard of blackbirds chattering in a tree, and then all of them\r\nsuddenly stop, haven’t you? The silence is painful. Well, that’s the way\r\nit was in that bob-sleigh.\r\n\r\n“But Jim was after bigger game than that, though he couldn’t resist the\r\ntemptation to have a little fun with every nobby turnout he met.\r\n\r\n“‘Cawn’t you pass that old fellah, James,’ the male occupant of a swell\r\nrig would call out to his coachman, after Jim would wiggle along, half\r\nasleep, beside the fancy turnout.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, yes, your ’oner,’ James would say, and swell up in the true English\r\nstyle and pull at his ’ackneys and spread around blustering, and cast\r\nwithering glances on the innocent looking hayseed rig. Then Jim would\r\nwake up, shake the old pacer, and leave them like Mark Twain’s coyote on\r\nthe desert left the ambitious dog—a gray crack in the air and he was gone\r\nwhile the English coachman cussed those “low-down Hamerican ’osses” with\r\nthe best mixture of Billingsgate and flunky at his command.\r\n\r\n“But he got off the best one on two young fellows who thought they had\r\na fast trotter. They came tearing down on Jim, intending to go by him\r\nlike a flash. But just as they came up Jim shook up the old pacer, and\r\nhe threw up his tail for all the world like he was frightened nearly to\r\ndeath, and with that wild look that made Jim afterwards declare he really\r\nbelieved the old rascal was onto the game himself, he would dart away,\r\nthreatening to break and go all to pieces every minute. This would make\r\nthe trotting fellows come faster, and Jim would make it worse by looking\r\nlike he was ‘skeered’ nearly to death, and shouting out:\r\n\r\n“‘Gentlemen, hold up, please; you’ll skeer the old hoss to death. He\r\nallers runs away at a pace when he’s skeered. Hold up. Hold up, for\r\nheaven’s sake!’\r\n\r\n“Jim would let them chase him that way for a mile, till their horse was\r\nblown and would go to a break before they’d catch on, and try to sneak\r\naway down some side street. Then Jim would holler out:\r\n\r\n“‘Gentlemen, don’t never do that no more—don’t never do it ergin, on your\r\nlife! This old hoss might ’er run erway an’ ruined me! He always would\r\nrun away in a pace when he got skeered. Learned it when he was a colt—got\r\nskeered at a trottin’ hoss haulin’ a load of manure through the medder\r\nlot, where he was grazin’, an’ he can’t stan’ it to this day!’ Then he\r\nwould chuckle out loud and throw this parting shot at them: ‘But, say,\r\nyoung fellers, don’t you wish sumpin’ would skeer that thar trotter of\r\nyours, good, once?’\r\n\r\n“But the meanest thing Jim and that old pacer did was to break up a love\r\nmatch. It was a young fellow and his girl, and Jim says when he came up\r\nbehind them their horse was in a slow walk, like they wanted that ride to\r\nlast forever—and they were so interested in looking in each other’s eyes,\r\nand holding hands under the robe, and they never knew that it was daytime\r\nand that it was the sun, and not a low-turned gas jet, that was burning\r\noverhead. Jim knew the young fellow, and the horse he was driving, too.\r\nThe horse was quite a fancy looking trotter, just pretty enough to catch\r\nanybody’s eye that wanted a Sunday-go-to-meetin’ kind of a horse. He\r\nhad once taken a tincup record of 2:26¼ by some hook and crook, and on\r\nthe road for a quarter of a mile, he could trot a buzz-saw clip, as long\r\nas he thought he was beating all creation, and didn’t get another crotch\r\nin his head—for he had clock works, with a chimes attachment there, and\r\nno mistake. There was plenty of room for Jim to go around and let those\r\nyoung people alone, but he saw too good a chance for fun, and that’s what\r\nhe was out for. He wiggled up right behind the hand-holding pair, and,\r\npulling out a red silk handkerchief, he blew his nose with a terrible\r\nblast. He did it to attract their attention and let them know that the\r\nrest of the world ‘do move, too,’ but it was more effectual than he\r\nhad hoped. That chimes-headed horse must have thought it was Gabriel’s\r\ntrumpet, for he jumped ten feet when Jim gave that blast, shook the\r\nlovers like an earthquake and banged the girl’s best hat up against the\r\nback of the sleigh. The young fellow pulled his horse down and looked\r\nback daggers at Jim, then touched him up and lit out to leave him. This\r\nwas just what Jim wanted, and he sailed after them in great shape. It\r\nwas an awful pretty race for about two hundred yards, and then Jim let\r\nthe old pacer glide up nose and nose with the trotter, who was walling\r\nhis eye around and already showing signs of quitting with a little more\r\ncollaring. When Jim did that he heard the girl say excitedly, ‘Oh, Harry,\r\nis that horrid old horse going to beat Sir Charles Grandeville?’\r\n\r\n“‘I’m just feeling him, now,’ Harry replied. ‘Wait a minute, darling, and\r\nI will make him sick. There’s nothing on this road can beat Sir Charles!’\r\n\r\n“Jim chuckled and let out a link or two, and the old pacer forged ahead.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, Harry, but he is beating us—hurry up, dear, let him show that 2:20\r\nclip, or lock, or whatever you told me about Just now. O-o-o-o Harry!!’\r\n\r\n“This last remark was caused by Sir Charles going into as many different\r\nbreaks as there are pieces in a jointed snake, while Harry laid the whip\r\non him with something that sounded, under his breath, like ‘Whoa! Dash\r\nblank your jumping-jack, white-livered hide! I’ll teach you how to quit\r\nevery time an ox cart tries to pass you!’\r\n\r\n“And as Jim sailed away he heard the girl haughtily and freezingly saying:\r\n\r\n“‘Mr. Harry Smith, I’ll thank you, sir, to put me out at the first house\r\nyou pass! I’m glad I found you out in time. Any man who will beat and\r\nswear at his horse as you have done will beat and swear at his wife, and\r\nI’ll never marry you, sir, never!’\r\n\r\n“As I said above, that was the meanest thing Jim did that day.\r\n\r\n“Well, we harvested our winter oats two hours afterwards, when Jim\r\nentered his pacer in the free-for-all down the boulevard. Some few had\r\ncaught on, but I found enough that hadn’t to cover Jim’s hundred I held\r\nand another for myself, and when the old farmer and the pacer beat the\r\ngang further than any of them cared to tell about afterwards, as I said\r\nbefore, it brought on a blizzard that cooled all the racing enthusiasm in\r\nthat town up to the time I left, and many of them hadn’t discovered then\r\nthat they had been racing green horses and two-thirty roadsters against\r\none of the best known drivers in the East, up behind a pacer who started\r\nten times last year, won eight first moneys and two seconds, and took a\r\nmark close down to 2:10.”\r\n\r\n“I see from the paper,” he said, as he pulled out a local paper, “that\r\nthey are racing there on the snow path this week, but I’ll bet my\r\nwinter overcoat they have taken the precaution to bar all hayseeds and\r\ncurby-legged pacers in the country.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR PAGE OF POETS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LYNCHERS.\r\n\r\n    A thousand yelling savages proclaim\r\n    Their swift advance.

The\r\nrejected stone throughout the centuries has always been the keystone in\r\nthe arch of fame, and genius and greatness always have and always will\r\ncome from the bosom of Mother Earth. The best legacy a boy can have is an\r\nhonest ancestry and a condition that forces him to work. And, therefore,\r\nI am always sorry for the young man who “has a fine start in life.” He\r\nhas as many chances for failure as the “brilliant young lawyer” has for\r\nmediocrity and a bar-room clientage. Success despises assistance and\r\nfame hates caste and titles as the gods do salt water. Mediocrity, like\r\na faint hearted hound, may always be found running up and down the river\r\nof his purpose, fearing to plunge and doubting the ford, while success\r\nplunges in and crosses, or dies trying. Two generations of idleness will\r\nbreed crime, while two generations of shirt sleeves mean wealth. If the\r\nworld would stop working a year God would have to destroy it with fire\r\nand brimstone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPoetry should be brought back to the uses for which it was intended. The\r\nmetaphysical school that is trying now to control it, and whose object\r\nseems to be to make it a science instead of a pleasure and beautiful way\r\nof expressing our thoughts, should be driven from our standard as they\r\nhave always been from our hearts. We must go back to first and natural\r\nprinciples again, and by demanding imagination, simplicity, beauty and\r\nnaturalness, make poetry a vehicle of the pure and the beautiful, and\r\nso simple that ordinary minds can read it with pleasure and understand\r\nwhat they read. The story age of Spencer, Shakespeare and Burns should\r\nbe received and much of Browning’s stuff flung to the dogs, where it\r\nbelongs. God has given us poetry to be enjoyed, to be understood, to\r\nmake us wiser and better, to take to our hearts and firesides. Its\r\nprinciple is all but universal and there are few who do not, in some\r\nshape, enjoy it. It was not intended to be an intellectual puzzle, a\r\nmetaphysical science to be gobbled up by a few abnormally developed\r\nprotoplasms and denied to the world of yearning hearts. Imagine Homer\r\nreciting his glorious stories of Agamemnon and Ulysses, of “Ox-eyed Juno”\r\nand Penelaus, “tamer of horses,” to the Greek philosophers; imagine\r\nShakespeare giving “Romeo and Juliet” in a barn to the learned of Europe.\r\nOf Burns lying in the dew of the haystack watching the morning star\r\nquiver like the soul of Highland Mary and then writing his deathless song\r\nfor the ears of those people who live in palaces and never saw a morning\r\nstar, nor felt the kiss of an honest love in their lives.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe world is wild for prose stories. The reason is obvious. The stories\r\nhave been shut out of poetry by the metaphysical school, and, being\r\nunable to get them in the language of the heart, of the imagination,\r\nthe world which must have them is taking them in the language of the\r\ncommonplace. And thus is the true and the beautiful being destroyed to\r\ngive way to the double meaning and the sensational. The so-called poetry\r\nof to-day is not new. The only reason a lot of metaphysical poetry has\r\nnot been handed down to us is because it did not live to get to us. Five\r\nhundred years hence the people who will know Burns will have to hunt\r\naround in a sheepskin encyclopoedia of biography to find out who Howells\r\nand Henry James were. We must not forget that contemporary criticism\r\nplaced Ben Jonson ahead of Shakespeare, Pope above Milton, Scott above\r\nKeats. And yet Pope and Scott did a world of harm to poetry. They helped\r\nto drive it out by disgusting people with the sameness of its flow and\r\nthe smoothness of its rhythm. As if the wind roars ’round the house by\r\na foot and a meter measure as Whitmore expressed it, as if the mountain\r\nlooms up by a law of rising and falling, or the waves thunder like a\r\nchurch organ.\r\n\r\nBut the grave of truth is never the theme of fraud but for one\r\ngeneration—the next one finds truth on the monument and wrong in the\r\ngrave. Let us get back to truth; though dead, she is a sweeter mistress\r\nthan a living and bedecked and bespangled lie. As Romeo said over\r\nJuliet’s body, so with poetry:\r\n\r\n    “Death that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,\r\n    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.\r\n    Thou art not conquered: beauty’s ensign yet\r\n    Is crimson on thy lips and on thy cheeks,\r\n    And death’s pale flag is not advanced there.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTrotwood loves to throw a bouquet—he believes they are more easily\r\ngathered in the sunshine around us and leave a more pleasant memory\r\nthan some other things which might be cast, such, for instance, as\r\nbricks and stones. Especially does he love to throw them when they are\r\nintended for a lovely woman. And we have known her long—Miss Minnie\r\nMcIntyre, editor of the new horse show paper, The Bit and Spur, of\r\nChicago, and so we know whereof we speak when we say that in her class\r\nshe is simply an “only,” and her monthly, The Bit and Spur, is a gem\r\nof its kind, and an inspiration. It is beautifully illustrated, its\r\nworkmanship is the finest, and is the best edited magazine of its class\r\nin the whole country. If you love the horse shows you cannot afford to\r\nmiss its monthly visits. This is written deliberately and with charity\r\naforethought, and while it may have the flavors of the village sanctum\r\nsanctorum, yet when a woman gets into the strenuous fight around her\r\nand with her bright mind and pen rises to the very top, there is always\r\ngrowing in Trotwood’s garden a bouquet of sunflowers for her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConcerning Southern magazines, it is the fact that none has ever been\r\nable to live in the South. We appreciated that fact with all its force\r\nwhen we launched Trotwood’s Monthly. But we think we have studied the\r\nsituations thoroughly enough to know the reason of this: First, they have\r\nall been feeble imitations of Northern magazines—a field so well and ably\r\nfilled already. Every section of our country has its own character, its\r\nown atmosphere, its own earmarks. People North and West, when they buy a\r\nSouthern magazine, want the South to be in it—its stories, traditions,\r\nits sunshine, its fields, its very air. They want to hear of the land\r\nwhich is harvesting and sowing, while they are in the far-off snow,\r\nwaiting to see the good, glad earth again; the land where the average\r\nfarmer does not spend all he makes in the summer keeping himself and\r\nhis stock warm in the winter; the land that is Southern—the great,\r\nundeveloped country of the future. Trotwood’s Monthly is trying to do\r\nthis. In the second place, Southern people are not great readers. There\r\nare too many chances to get out of doors—any time and all the time.\r\nLike the petted children of indulgent parents, kind Nature does so much\r\nfor them—they do little for themselves. And a child will never leave\r\nthe joyous out-doors for the study, the schoolroom or the work shop.\r\nIn literature the great South is but a child. But last and chiefest,\r\nno magazine has ever been launched in the South to supply a practical\r\ndemand, instead of creating a supply. Sentiment is a great thing, but\r\nlike blue litmus paper, it changes quickly if it meets an acid. And\r\nsentiment meets an acid every little while. Trotwood’s Monthly is\r\nsupplying practical demand, not trying to create a supply, dependent on\r\nlocal sentiment. It is weaving the Southern atmosphere around a practical\r\nsubject—a subject in demand all over the world, as our subscription\r\nlist, which now has reached a goodly number in every State in the Union,\r\nin Canada, even to faraway Nova Scotia, in South Africa, Honolulu and\r\nAustralia. Around this practical subject for which there is a positive\r\ndemand, we will weave the Southern literature and life, and in that way\r\ndo we hope to live. Sentiment alone will carry no magazine beyond the\r\nfirst year, and the story of the literature of every people—aye, of every\r\nliterary workman among the people—is that the practical staff must go\r\nwith the first efforts long before he who runs, learns how to read.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTrotwood’s Monthly is going slow, but with the staff of the practical for\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nTrotwood’s Monthly wants good stories and poems. Write them, but let them\r\nbe life, for literature, if real, is but the true interpretation of life.\r\nWrite of the life around you, not of that in some other State or country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf you fail to get your Monthly promptly, be sure to write and let us\r\nknow. The Monthly comes out on the 15th of each month. We always have\r\nextra numbers for those which miscarry in the mails. Drop us a postal if\r\nyou fail to get yours promptly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. A. D. Shamel, physiologist in charge of Tobacco Breeding In the\r\nBureau of Plant Industry, United States Department of Agriculture,\r\nWashington, D. C., sends the following appreciative letter: “I appreciate\r\nthe high character of your Monthly, and know that it will be of great\r\nservice in promoting the best interests of the agricultural interests\r\nwhich it represents. In the great agricultural awakening taking place in\r\nthe South and the development of her great resources, there is certainly\r\na great field of valuable work.” Prof. Schumel will favor us soon with a\r\nvaluable paper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMen seem to be animals which would not only betray other men, but their\r\nown children, if there was no higher power to prevent. One of the curses\r\nof the South is child labor—another form of slavery and race suicide.\r\nIn the new era dawning in the South, this curse has come in with the\r\nspindle and the money behind it has been so great that in some Southern\r\nStates, like South Carolina and Georgia, the friends of the child and of\r\nhumanity have been unable to pass child labor laws. The legislators are\r\nbought by the money of the corporations. The South is making a strenuous\r\neffort to correct this evil, but it is met by graft and bribery, evasion\r\nand contempt of the law, and the shame goes on. Take from anyone’s life\r\nits untrammeled childhood, and what is left? Not even the memory of a\r\nsweetness. White child slavery in the cotton mills of the country to-day\r\nis worse than negro slavery ever was. After many fruitless efforts,\r\nAlabama, which has rapidly taken first rank among all the Southern\r\nStates, succeeded two years ago in passing a child labor law, the age\r\nlimit being twelve years. On the day this law went into effect, one\r\nhundred and twenty-five children, all white, walked out of one mill\r\nat Lannett, Ala. The most of the children, perhaps, had never been to\r\nschool in their lives and never would have had the opportunity. Not only\r\nthat, but half of them would never have lived to maturity, and these, at\r\ntwenty, would look like middle-aged, decrepit, ambitionless folks from\r\nwhom the life had been crushed. The use of child labor not only promotes\r\nrace suicide and all manner of narrow injustice, but encourages laziness\r\nin the parents, as in nearly all cases the children support the parents\r\nin idleness. The law is now rendered almost null by the fact that the\r\nparents do not hesitate to swear falsely to the age of their children in\r\norder to put them to work in the mills.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat is a thought—an idea? The most valuable asset in the brain of man.\r\nNot common, ordinary thinking, but a new thought—a thought which no one\r\nelse ever originated. There is such a thought in the letter below, and I\r\nam publishing it, taken from many other letters to Trotwood, because of\r\nthat particular thought and not on account of the nice things the author\r\nis kind enough to say. I have underscored the thought I have selected.\r\nRead it and tell me, are you doing your work because you must do\r\nsomething, or are you doing it because it is the something you must do.\r\nThink and find out, for on it depends whether your life will be a success\r\nor failure:\r\n\r\n                                Medicine Lodge, Kan., Oct. 30, 1905.\r\n\r\n    Dear Trotwood:\r\n\r\n    The first and second number of the Monthly have come and, to\r\n    tell you how much we have enjoyed them, I must use a big word\r\n    and say immensely. The farmer who will follow their counsel\r\n    will soon have to pull down his barns and build greater, while\r\n    he will have treasures laid up where neither moth nor rust doth\r\n    corrupt; it is the only magazine I know of giving advice about\r\n    this world and the next.\r\n\r\n    So old Solomon could not resist the Influence of beauty, his\r\n    namesake of old fell at the same place.\r\n\r\n    I think you have established the origin of the pacing horse.\r\n    Poor fellow, he has fought his way to fame, but like nature’s\r\n    gentleman,\r\n\r\n        “He may not have ancestral fame\r\n          His pathway to illume;\r\n        The sun that flings the brightest ray\r\n          May rise from mist and gloom.”\r\n\r\n    After all, it is the irrepressive in either man or horse that\r\n    makes him great.\r\n\r\n    When you see a man go to work because he must do something,\r\n    very likely you will never hear about him or the work; while\r\n    another goes at a work because it is something he must do, then\r\n    look for something great.\r\n\r\n    This will hold good in regard to the newspaper jingle you spoke\r\n    of, written by someone anxious to see his name in print. Burns\r\n    could not help writing about Mary, and so immortalized the name\r\n    a second time. I venture the assertion, Trotwood’s Monthly is\r\n    not written because he must do something, but rather because it\r\n    is something he must do.\r\n\r\n    And now, about the Dakota hunt. Well, for beauty of sentiment\r\n    and sublimity of style, it surpasses anything that has been\r\n    written on the like subject hitherto.\r\n\r\n    I have read it over and over again until I became spellbound by\r\n    the magic of the scene. It brought before my mind the memory\r\n    of other days when I, too, saw something similar, only in a\r\n    smaller way, on the fields of Kansas. I feel I have wearied you\r\n    with much talking and will ask the same forgiveness that Mr.\r\n    Stone granted you when you shot first.\r\n\r\n                            Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                                     ROBT. HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe publisher of a disreputable sheet in New York, which makes its living\r\nby holding up society and dishing out scandal about men and women, has\r\nsued that splendid and fearless paper, Collier’s Weekly, for libel,\r\nthe occasion of the exposure by Collier’s was a venomous attack by the\r\nsheet aforesaid upon the President’s daughter. Collier’s, with its\r\ncharacteristic ability, laid the sheet open to its knife, showing how it\r\nheld up people for hush money and lived in the gutters of things bad. For\r\nall of which it was sued for $100,000 by the aforesaid sheet. In a recent\r\neditorial on the subject, Norman Hapgood, the able editor of Collier’s,\r\nsays: “Men submit to blackmail to protect their wives and sisters from\r\nsuch sheets as this, for in the North the pocketbook has replaced the\r\npistol.”\r\n\r\nThe South, to people who do not know her, has many faults. One of these\r\nis the quickness and certainty with which her men have always meted out\r\ntragic justice to the brute, black or white, who tears down the barrier\r\nbetween his own vile passions, whether of malice or murder, and a woman’s\r\npurity. Nor has any court or any jury ever convicted the man who used his\r\npistol to protect the name of his women. In such cases, the law considers\r\nthe man to be temporarily insane, at the sudden destruction of his home\r\nand happiness, and though it also recognizes what is called “cooling\r\ntime” for such frenzy, an old Georgia judge years ago expressed the\r\nsentiment of the entire South on this subject when he declared in such a\r\ncase that “cooling time with this court means ninety-nine years.”\r\n\r\nMany sheets of the kind mentioned have tried to build their foul nest\r\nin the South, forgetting that here the pocketbook is not the god it is\r\nwhere people live only for money. Its end is invariably the same and\r\nthe curtain drops to the rapid fire of pistol shots, “and the rest is\r\nsilence.”\r\n\r\nThis has come from the old South which taught that money was not all of\r\nlife, that a man’s word was his bond and a woman’s good character her\r\ncrown. And words being bonds, men were careful of them, for the man who\r\nhas to redeem his words with his pistol instead of his pocketbook is more\r\ncareful how he uses them. We wish Collier’s a speedy vindication. Indeed,\r\nwe predict the trial will prove something of the same kind of a farce as\r\nthat of the windy Prof. Trigg, of the Chicago University, who taught the\r\nclasses that Rockefeller was greater than Shakespeare, that our hymns\r\nwere all doggerel and much else that was false. He was unwise enough\r\nto bring suit for libel against a New York daily which held him up to\r\nridicule. On trial he proved by his own testimony that he was even more\r\nignorant and ridiculous than the defendant had supposed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd we appreciate greatly the letter below from so distinguished a source\r\nas Mr. Spillman, in the Bureau of Plant Industry, Washington, D. C.:\r\n\r\n    Mr. John Trotwood Moore, care Trotwood Publishing Co.,\r\n    Nashville, Tenn.\r\n\r\n    My Dear Sir: Your favor of October 19 has remained unanswered\r\n    thus long on account of my absence from the office.\r\n\r\n    I have read the copy of Trotwood’s Monthly with a great deal of\r\n    interest, and wish to congratulate you on its high character.\r\n    You are certainly striking out in a new line compared with our\r\n    present agricultural literature. None of our farm papers have\r\n    heretofore attempted the literary excellence of Trotwood’s\r\n    Monthly, confining themselves more particularly to the\r\n    instructional side of farming. I am much interested in your\r\n    venture and hope that it may meet with the highest success. Our\r\n    farmers have been a little too much inclined to look at the\r\n    financial side of their business and they need something that\r\n    will help in other directions. This you seem to be able to give.\r\n\r\n    While reading your magazine I was struck by the fact that my\r\n    own work has nearly all been directed toward the financial side\r\n    of farming, but you have given me a new idea and one which I\r\n    hope will have its effect upon my future work. I shall take\r\n    pleasure in sending you once in a while anything I may be able\r\n    to write which I think will be of interest to your readers.\r\n\r\n    Wishing you the highest success, I am\r\n\r\n                           Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                      W.

Since the world was\r\nmade, the experience of life is the nearer the sun the less the work. But\r\nthe real lesson is deeper.
