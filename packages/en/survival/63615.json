New methods have been devised, fresh\r\ndiscoveries have been made, new theories have been propounded; the field\r\nof work has widened enormously. In fact, the science of the heavens has\r\nbecome not only boundless in its possibilities, but more awe-inspiring\r\nand marvellous.\r\n\r\nTo whom in the main is this great advance due? To the great pioneer of\r\nwhat may be called modern astronomy—William Herschel. Not only did\r\nHerschel reconstruct the science and widen its bounds, but his powerful\r\ngenius directed the course of nineteenth century research. As an\r\nastronomical observer he has never been surpassed. In the breadth of his\r\nviews he was equalled only by Newton; and indeed he excelled Newton in\r\nhis unwearied observations and his sweeping conceptions of the Universe.\r\nTo quote his own remark to the poet Campbell, he “looked farther into\r\nspace than ever human being did before him.”\r\n\r\nHerschel studied astronomy in all its aspects. In all the branches of\r\nmodern astronomy he was a pioneer. He observed the Sun, Moon, and\r\nplanets, devoting special attention to Mars and Saturn. He doubled the\r\ndiameter of the Solar System by the discovery of Uranus. He discovered\r\nseveral satellites and studied comets. He was pre-eminently the founder\r\nof sidereal astronomy. He discovered binary stars, thus tracing the law\r\nof gravitation in the distant star-depths; while to him is due the\r\ncredit of the discovery of the motion of the Solar System. He founded\r\nthe study of star-clusters and nebulæ, propounded the nebular\r\nhypothesis, and devised two methods of star-gauging. Above all, he was\r\nthe first to attempt the solution of one of the noblest problems ever\r\nattacked by man—the structure of the Universe. In fact, the latter\r\nproblem was the end and aim of his observations. As Miss Clerke remarks,\r\n“The magnificence of the idea, which was rooted in his mind from the\r\nstart, places him apart from and above all preceding observers.” Most of\r\nthe departments of modern astronomy find a meeting-place in Herschel, as\r\nthe branches run to the root of the tree. He discussed astronomy from\r\nevery point of view. Before, however, proceeding to examine the work of\r\nthis great man, it is well to note a few of his characteristics. These\r\ncharacteristics, once understood, give us the key to his researches.\r\nBefore we can master Herschel the astronomer we must understand Herschel\r\nthe man.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that Herschel spent most of his life in\r\nEngland, and that he is included in the ‘Dictionary of National\r\nBiography,’ he was pre-eminently a German. Like most Germans his style\r\nof writing was somewhat obscure, and this was emphasised when he wrote\r\nin English, owing to his imperfect command of the language. Had he\r\nwritten in German as well as in English, he would probably have been\r\nbetter understood in his native country, where erroneous views of his\r\ntheories were long entertained. Even so distinguished an astronomer as\r\nWilhelm Struve, when translating Herschel’s papers into German, made a\r\nmistake when translating a certain passage, which leaves the erroneous\r\nimpression that Herschel believed the Universe to be infinite—a mistake\r\nwhich would not have arisen had he written in German.\r\n\r\nThe student of Herschel should also be careful in quoting the views of\r\nthe great astronomer. Had Herschel at the close of his life written a\r\nvolume containing his final views on the construction of the heavens,\r\nthis would not have been necessary; but Herschel did not write such a\r\nvolume. His researches were embodied in a series of papers communicated\r\nto the Royal Society from 1780 to 1818. As he observed the heavens his\r\nopinions progressed, so that a statement of his views at any given time\r\nwas by no means a statement of his final opinions. The late R. A.\r\nProctor, who was the first great exponent of Herschel in England, has\r\nwell said: “It seems to have been supposed that his papers could be\r\ntreated as we might treat such a work as Sir J. Herschel’s ‘Outlines of\r\nAstronomy’; that extracts might be made from any part of any paper\r\nwithout reference to the position which the paper chanced to occupy in\r\nthe entire series.”\r\n\r\nHerschel, like the true student of nature, held theories very lightly.\r\nThey were to him but roads to the truth. Unlike many scientists, he did\r\nnot interpret observations by hypothesis: he framed his theories to fit\r\nhis observations. If he found that a certain theory did not agree with\r\nwhat he actually saw in the heavens, he abandoned it: he did not\r\nhesitate to change his views as his investigations proceeded. “No fear\r\nof ‘committing himself,’” says Miss Clerke in her admirable work on ‘The\r\nHerschels,’ “deterred him from imparting the thoughts that accompanied\r\nhis multitudinous observations. He felt committed to nothing but truth.”\r\n\r\nIn the mind of Herschel imagination and observation were marvellously\r\nblended. He was a philosophical astronomer. Although his imagination was\r\na very vivid one he did not allow his fancies to run away with him, as\r\nKepler sometimes did: on the other hand, he did not, like Flamsteed,\r\nrefrain from speculating altogether. “We ought,” he wrote in 1785, “to\r\navoid two opposite extremes. If we indulge a fanciful imagination, and\r\nbuild worlds of our own, we must not wonder at our going wide from the\r\npath of truth and nature. On the other hand, if we add observation to\r\nobservation, without attempting to draw not only certain conclusions but\r\nalso conjectural views from them, we offend against the very end for\r\nwhich only observations ought to be made.”\r\n\r\nThese characteristics—the lightness with which he held his theories, his\r\nvivid imagination, and his philosophical reasoning—are the secrets of\r\nHerschel’s success as an astronomer. Nearly all his ideas and\r\nspeculations have been confirmed. As Arago has said, “We cannot but feel\r\na deep reverence for that powerful genius that has scarcely ever erred.”\r\nHerschel, like all other great students of Nature, was deeply religious.\r\nHe could not observe the heavens without feeling awed at the marvels\r\nwhich his telescopes revealed. In his own words, “It is surely a very\r\nlaudable thing to receive instruction from the Great Workmaster of\r\nNature.”\r\n\r\nFriedrich Wilhelm Herschel, born in Hanover on November 15, 1738, was\r\nthe fourth child of Isaac Herschel, an oboist in the band of the\r\nHanoverian Guard. Isaac Herschel, a native of Dresden, was an\r\naccomplished musician, and all his children, ten in number, inherited\r\nhis talent. Of these ten, six survived, and only two became famous.\r\nThese were William, the great astronomer, and his sister Caroline (born\r\non March 16, 1750), who became a student of the heavens only second to\r\nher brother.\r\n\r\nAt the garrison school in Hanover, where the Herschels were educated,\r\nWilliam Herschel showed intense love and aptitude for learning, and was\r\nmore diligent and persevering than his brother Jacob, his senior by four\r\nyears. In 1753 he became oboist in the band of the Hanoverian Guard in\r\nwhich his father was now bandmaster. In her valuable memoirs, his sister\r\nrelates that her father was very interested in astronomy, and that he\r\ntaught his children the names of the constellations. William became\r\ndevoted to the science, and constructed a small celestial globe on which\r\nequator and ecliptic were engraved. But his studies were much hampered.\r\nHis mother had a great dislike to learning: she had no sympathy with\r\naspirations, and tried to prevent her children becoming well educated.\r\nAbove all, the Hanoverian Guard was ordered to England in 1755, when a\r\nFrench invasion was feared, and to that country Herschel proceeded,\r\nalong with his father and brother.\r\n\r\nReturning to Germany in 1756, the Hanoverian Guard was employed the\r\nfollowing year in the Seven Years’ War. Hanover was invaded by the\r\nFrench, and, conscription being the rule, the musicians were not\r\nexempted from service. Under the command of the Duke of Cumberland the\r\nGuard suffered a terrible defeat at Hastenbeck. William Herschel spent\r\nthe night after the battle in a ditch, and decided that soldiering would\r\nnot be his profession. He deserted, and, with the consent of his\r\nparents, he sailed for England. After his arrival at Dover, he wandered\r\nthrough the country in search of musical employment. At length, in 1760,\r\nhe was appointed to train the band of the Durham Militia, and four years\r\nlater paid a secret visit to Hanover, where he was welcomed by his\r\nfather, whose health was now failing, and by his sister Caroline. In the\r\nfollowing year he was promoted to the post of organist at Halifax, and\r\nin 1766 he removed to Bath as oboist in Linley’s Orchestra. Finally, in\r\n1767, he became organist in the new Octagon Chapel at Bath. Herschel was\r\nnow twenty-nine years old, and known as a famous musician. As Miss\r\nClerke remarks: “The Octagon Chapel soon became a centre of fashionable\r\nattraction, and he soon found himself lifted on the wave of public\r\nfavour. Pupils of high rank thronged to him, and his lessons often\r\nmounted to thirty-five a-week.”\r\n\r\nIn the year of his appointment his father died, aged sixty, after a life\r\nof trouble and hardship. His death was a great blow to his daughter\r\nCaroline, whom he had educated when her mother was from home. Caroline\r\nHerschel was naturally possessed of musical ability, but her mother and\r\nelder brother had determined that she should be a housemaid,—a\r\ndetermination which William, who was devotedly attached to his sister,\r\nopposed. Finally, in 1772, he visited Hanover, and took his sister to\r\nEngland with him to act as his housekeeper. But for her unwearied\r\ndevotion it is doubtful whether William Herschel would have become the\r\ngreat astronomer.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of his appointment in Bath Herschel commenced the study\r\nof languages and mathematics, reading Maclaurin’s ‘Fluxions’ and\r\nFerguson’s ‘Astronomy.’ The perusal of the latter volume revived his\r\nlove for astronomy. After fourteen or sixteen hours’ teaching he would\r\nretire to his bedroom and read of the wonders of the heavens. His\r\ninterest increased as he proceeded, until, in his own words, “I resolved\r\nto take nothing upon trust, but to see with my own eyes all that other\r\nmen had seen before me.” Accordingly he hired a small reflector.\r\nInquiring the price of a larger instrument, he found it to be quite\r\nbeyond his means. Then in 1772, when his sister came to keep his house\r\nfor him, he resolved to make his own telescope. First he tried the\r\nfitting of lenses into pasteboard tubes, but this being a total failure,\r\nhe bought the apparatus of a Quaker optician who had constructed, or\r\nattempted to construct, reflecting telescopes. In June 1773, assisted by\r\nhis sister and by his brother Alexander, then in Bath, he commenced\r\nwork. His first speculum mirror was five inches in diameter; and, while\r\nit was in process of construction, he was obliged to hold his hands on\r\nit for sixteen hours at a stretch, while his sister supplied his food\r\nand read ‘The Arabian Nights,’ ‘Don Quixote,’ and other tales aloud to\r\nhim to pass the time. At last, after two hundred failures, he finished a\r\n5-inch reflector, and on March 4, 1774, he observed the Orion nebula. No\r\nsooner had Herschel commenced his celestial explorations than he\r\nresolved to survey the entire heavens, leaving no spot unvisited.\r\n\r\nIn 1775 he commenced his review of the heavens, but finding his\r\ntelescope inadequate he began the work of telescope-making afresh.\r\nMeanwhile he had much to distract him from astronomy. In 1776 he became\r\ndirector of the Public Concerts at Bath. Yet his enthusiasm was\r\nunbounded: he would run to his house between the acts at the theatre to\r\nobserve the heavens. In 1779, when observing the Moon from the street in\r\nfront of his house, a gentleman asked permission to see the celestial\r\nwonders, a request which Herschel granted. The gentleman, Dr Watson of\r\nBath, introduced Herschel to the Literary Society, and we find him in\r\n1780 contributing two papers to the Royal Society on Mira Ceti and the\r\nMoon. In the same year he commenced his second review of the heavens,\r\nand during its progress he made his first great discovery. On March 13,\r\n1781, while surveying the constellation Gemini, he discovered a faint\r\nobject distinguished by a disc, which he concluded to be a tailless\r\ncomet, but which was soon shown to be a new planet beyond the orbit of\r\nSaturn. This was the first planetary discovery made within the memory of\r\nman. King George III. summoned Herschel to London, and gave him a\r\npension of £200 a-year, with the title of King’s Astronomer, pardoning\r\nhim also for his desertion from the army more than twenty years\r\npreviously. Herschel then named the new planet the “Georgium Sidus,” a\r\ntitle now abandoned and replaced by Uranus.\r\n\r\nWilliam and Caroline Herschel now moved to Datchet, near Windsor, in\r\n1785 to Clay Hall, and finally, in 1786, to Slough,—“the spot of all the\r\nworld,” said Arago, “where the greatest number of discoveries have been\r\nmade.” Here Herschel and his sister worked for nearly forty years. He\r\ncommunicated to the Royal Society paper after paper on astronomy in all\r\nits aspects. He also continued the work of telescope-making, and\r\nconstructed, in 1789, his 40-foot reflector, the wonder of the age. In\r\n1787 his sister was appointed his assistant, and together the Herschels\r\nworked from dusk to dawn. Caroline Herschel herself detected eight\r\ncomets and numerous nebulæ. She relates in her memoirs that on one\r\noccasion, while she was acting as assistant, the ink froze in her pen.\r\nBut such inconveniences mattered not to the Herschels. As Miss Clerke\r\nhas well remarked, “Every serene dark night was to him a precious\r\nopportunity, availed of to the last minute. The thermometer might\r\ndescend below zero, ink might freeze, mirrors might crack; but, provided\r\nthe stars shone, he and his sister worked on from dusk to dawn.... On\r\none occasion he is said to have worked without intermission at the\r\ntelescope and the desk for seventy-two hours.”\r\n\r\nHonours were showered on Herschel. He was knighted in 1816, and became\r\nPresident of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1820, besides receiving\r\nseveral honorary degrees. But honours in no way elated him. Advancing\r\nyears in no way affected his wonderful mind. But his duties as King’s\r\nAstronomer necessitated his acting as “showman of the heavens” on the\r\nvisits of royalties to Windsor, often after a whole day’s work, when\r\nrest was absolutely necessary. This tremendous strain, which reflects\r\nlittle credit on the Court, proved too much for the old man. His health\r\nbegan to give way, although his mind was as vigorous as ever.\r\n\r\nHerschel contributed his last paper to the Royal Society in 1818, and\r\nthree years later sent a list of double stars to the new Astronomical\r\nSociety. He made his last observation on June 1, 1821. His strength had\r\nnow left him, and to this he could not reconcile himself. As Miss Clerke\r\nputs it, “All his old instincts were still alive, only the bodily power\r\nto carry out their behests was gone. An unparalleled career of\r\nachievement left him unsatisfied with what he had done.... His strong\r\nnerves were at last shattered.” After a prolonged period of failing\r\nhealth he died at Slough, at the age of eighty-three, on August 25,\r\n1822. On September 7 he was buried in the church-yard of St Laurence at\r\nUpton. On his tombstone are engraved the words—“Cœlorum perrupit\r\nclaustra”—he broke through the barriers of the skies.\r\n\r\nThe death of her brother was a terrible blow to Caroline Herschel.\r\nExpecting to live only a twelvemonth, she returned to Hanover to the\r\nhome of her brother, Dietrich Herschel. But she lived twenty-five years\r\namong people who cared nothing for astronomy. She was delighted at Sir\r\nJohn Herschel’s continuation of his father’s work. She compiled a\r\ncatalogue of all the clusters and nebulæ observed by her brother, for\r\nwhich she received the gold medal of the Astronomical Society, and she\r\nwas created an honorary member. In 1846 she received from the King of\r\nPrussia the gold medal of science. But no honours made her in any way\r\nelated. She always held that whoever said much of her said too little of\r\nher brother. After a prolonged decline of health, she died on January 9,\r\n1848, aged ninety-seven years, and was buried beside her father in the\r\nchurchyard of the Gartengemeinde at Hanover, leaving behind her a noble\r\nexample of self-sacrifice and devotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                        HERSCHEL THE DISCOVERER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne result of Herschel’s discoveries among the stars and nebulæ is that\r\nhis studies of the Sun and planets, with the exception of the discovery\r\nof Uranus, have been completely thrown into the shade. Nevertheless, his\r\nwork in solar and planetary astronomy alone would have gained for him a\r\nhigher position in astronomy than his contemporaries. The planets,\r\nsatellites, and comets were all attentively studied by the great\r\nastronomer; indeed, the scientific investigation of the surfaces of Mars\r\nand Saturn began with Herschel.\r\n\r\n“His attention to the Sun,” Miss Clerke truly remarks, “might have been\r\nexclusive, so diligent was his scrutiny of its shining surface.”\r\nSunspots were specially investigated by Herschel, who closely studied\r\ntheir peculiarities, regarding them as depressions in the solar\r\natmosphere. He also paid much attention to the faculæ, but could not\r\nobserve them to the north and south of the Sun, thus proving their\r\nconnection with the spots which are confined to the regions north and\r\nsouth of the equator. “There is all over the Sun a great unevenness,”\r\nsaid Herschel, “which has the appearance of a mixture of small points of\r\nan unequal light; but they are evidently a roughness of high and low\r\nparts.”\r\n\r\nHerschel’s solar observations were very valuable, and did much for our\r\nknowledge of the orb of day. His theory of the Sun’s constitution—a\r\ndevelopment of the hypothesis put forward by _Alexander Wilson_\r\n(1714-1786), Professor of Astronomy in Glasgow—was, however, very far\r\nfrom the truth. This was almost the only instance in which Herschel was\r\nmistaken. He regarded the Sun as a cool, dark globe, “a very eminent,\r\nlarge, and lucid planet, evidently the first, or, in strictness of\r\nspeaking, the only primary one of our system.” In his opinion an\r\nextensive atmosphere surrounded the Sun, the upper stratum forming what\r\nSchröter named the “photosphere.” This atmosphere, estimated as two or\r\nthree thousand miles in depth, was regarded as giving out light and\r\nheat. Below this shining atmosphere there existed, Herschel believed, a\r\nregion of clouds protecting the globe of the Sun from the glowing\r\natmosphere, and reflecting much of the light intercepted by them. The\r\nspots were believed to be openings in these atmospheres, caused by the\r\naction of winds, the umbra or dark portion of the spot thus representing\r\nthe globe of the Sun, which Herschel believed to be “richly stored with\r\ninhabitants.” This theory held its ground for many years. Newton, it is\r\ntrue, believed the Sun to be gaseous, but he propounded no hypothesis of\r\nits constitution. Herschel’s theory, on the other hand, was fully\r\ndeveloped, plausible, and attractive. It was held by eminent men of\r\nscience until 1860, when the revelations of the spectroscope showed it\r\nto be quite untenable. The theory was supported for many years by Sir\r\nJohn Herschel, who, however, abandoned it in 1864. Herschel made several\r\nattempts to ascertain whether any connection existed between the state\r\nof the Sun and the condition of the Earth. In 1801 he was inclined to\r\nbelieve that “some temporary defect of vegetation” resulted from the\r\nabsence of sun-spots, which, he thought, “may lead us to expect a\r\ncopious emission of heat, and, therefore, mild seasons.” Herschel\r\nbelieved, in fact, that food became dear at the times of spot-minima. It\r\nmay be remarked that Herschel never noted the spot-period of eleven\r\nyears, the discovery of which was afterwards made by Schwabe.\r\n\r\nHerschel closely scrutinised the surfaces of the planets. Mercury alone\r\nwas neglected by him. From 1777 to 1793 he observed Venus, with the\r\nobject of determining the rotation period, but he was unable to observe\r\nany markings on the surface of the planet. He did not place reliance on\r\nSchröter’s value of the rotation period (about twenty-three hours).\r\nMeanwhile, Schröter announced the existence on Venus of mountains which\r\nrose to five or six times the height of Chimborazo. As to these, said\r\nHerschel, “I may venture to say that no eye which is not considerably\r\nbetter than mine, or assisted by much better instruments, will ever get\r\na sight of them.” Herschel demonstrated the existence of an extensive\r\natmosphere round Venus.\r\n\r\n“The analogy between Mars and the Earth,” Herschel wrote in 1783, “is\r\nperhaps by far the greatest in the whole Solar System.” In 1777 he\r\nbegan, in his house at Bath, a series of observations on the red planet,\r\nwhich yielded results of the utmost importance. Fixing his attention on\r\nthe white spots at the north and south poles,—discovered by Maraldi,\r\nnephew of Cassini,—he soon ascertained the fact that they waxed and\r\nwaned in size, the north polar cap shrinking during the summer of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, increasing in winter, and _vice versa_ in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere. He regarded the caps as masses of snow and ice\r\ndeposited from “a considerable, though moderate, atmosphere,” a theory\r\nnow generally accepted. Herschel gave an immense impetus to the study of\r\nMars. He carefully examined the planet’s surface, and the dark markings\r\nwere regarded by him as oceans.\r\n\r\nDuring Herschel’s lifetime the four small planets, Ceres, Pallas, Juno,\r\nand Vesta, were discovered by Piazzi, Olbers, and Harding. The great\r\nastronomer was much interested in these small worlds. He commenced a\r\nsearch through the Zodiacal constellations for new planets, but failed.\r\nHe was of opinion that many minor planets would be discovered. Accepting\r\nOlbers’ theory of the disruption of a primitive planet, Herschel\r\ncalculated that Mercury might be broken up into 35,000 globes equal to\r\nPallas. Meanwhile Herschel named the four new planets “Asteroids,” owing\r\nto their minute size. He estimated the diameter of Ceres at 162 miles\r\nand Pallas at 147 miles, but Professor Barnard’s measures have shown\r\nthem to be larger.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the discovery of the Asteroids, Herschel showed a\r\nvery fine spirit. In ‘The Edinburgh Review’ Brougham declared that\r\nHerschel had devised the word “asteroid,” so that the discoveries of\r\nPiazzi and Olbers might be kept on a lower level than his own discovery\r\nof Uranus. Many scientists would have been much offended at this\r\ncontemptible insult, but Herschel merely remarked that he had incurred\r\n“the illiberal criticism of ‘The Edinburgh Review,’” and that the\r\ndiscovery of the Asteroids “added more to the ornament of our system\r\nthan the discovery of another planet could have done.”\r\n\r\nIn Herschel’s time astronomers were acquainted with three of the outer\r\nplanets,—Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus,—all of which were closely studied\r\nby the great astronomer. The belts of Jupiter were supposed by him to be\r\nanalogous to the “trade-winds” in the atmosphere of the Earth; while the\r\ndrifting-spots on Jupiter’s disc and their irregular movements were\r\ncarefully noted. His observations on the four satellites of Jupiter led\r\nhim to believe that, like our Moon, they rotated on their axes in a\r\nperiod equal to that of their revolution round their primary—an opinion\r\nshared by Laplace, and by many modern astronomers.\r\n\r\nHerschel’s researches regarding Saturn were, however, much more\r\nimportant than those on Jupiter. The globe of the planet, the rings and\r\nthe satellites, were favourite objects of study at Bath and Slough. In\r\n1794 he perceived a spot on the surface of Saturn, and made the first\r\ndetermination of the rotation of the planet, which he fixed as 10 hours\r\n16 minutes,—a result confirmed by modern astronomers. The rings were\r\nsubjected to the closest scrutiny. Herschel believed them to be solid,\r\nand he also considered them to revolve round Saturn in about 10 hours.\r\nIt appears that he observed the famous “dusky ring,” but supposed it to\r\nbe a belt on the surface of the planet. He also studied Cassini’s\r\ndivision in the ring, ascertaining its reality.\r\n\r\nOn completing his famous 40-foot reflector, Herschel, on August 28,\r\n1789, turned it on Saturn and its five known satellites. Near the\r\nplanet, and in the plane of the ring, was seen another object, which\r\nHerschel believed to be a sixth satellite. To settle the question, he\r\nwatched the planet for several hours to see if the object would partake\r\nin the planet’s motion. Finding that it did, he announced it as a new\r\nsatellite, which he found to revolve round Saturn in 1 day 8 hours.\r\nAbout three weeks later, on September 17, Herschel discovered another\r\nsatellite yet closer to Saturn, revolving round the planet in about 22\r\nhours. These two satellites were not seen by any astronomers except\r\nHerschel; and after his death they could not be observed. His son,\r\nhowever, rediscovered them.\r\n\r\nThe eighth satellite, Japetus, was shown by Herschel to rotate on its\r\naxis in a period equal to that of its revolution, and his observations\r\nwere confirmed by modern observers. “I cannot,” Herschel said, “help\r\nreflecting with some pleasure on the discovery of an analogy which shows\r\nthat a certain uniform plan is carried on among the secondaries of our\r\nSolar System; and we may conjecture that probably most of the satellites\r\nare governed by the same law.” In April 1805 Herschel observed the globe\r\nof Saturn to present not a spherical but a “square-shouldered” aspect.\r\nIt was for long believed that this was an optical illusion; but Proctor\r\nand others have shown that it is quite possible for storms in Saturn’s\r\natmosphere to cause the planet’s apparent distortion in shape.\r\n\r\nHerschel paid much attention to the planet Uranus, which he discovered\r\non March 13, 1781. The discovery of Uranus, which was mentioned in a\r\nprevious chapter, was in a sense the most striking of Herschel’s\r\nachievements. Uranus was the first planet discovered within the memory\r\nof man: besides, the discovery enlarged the diameter of the Solar System\r\nfrom 886 to 1772 millions of miles. Throughout his lifetime Herschel\r\nreferred to the planet as the “Georgium Sidus,” out of gratitude to\r\nGeorge III. for appointing him King’s Astronomer; but the astronomers of\r\nFrance and Germany, who, as Sir Robert Ball remarks, “saw no reason why\r\nthe King of England should be associated with Jupiter and Saturn,”\r\nopposed this term. Lalande called the planet “Herschel,” but Herschel’s\r\ncountrymen, the Germans, named it Uranus, in keeping with the custom of\r\ndesignating the planets from the Greek mythology. The name of Uranus\r\nultimately prevailed.\r\n\r\nIn January 1787 Herschel discovered two satellites to Uranus, with the\r\naid of his 20-foot telescope. These satellites he believed to revolve\r\nround Uranus in 8 days and 13 days respectively, and accordingly he made\r\na drawing of what their positions should be on February 10. On that day\r\nhe found them in their predicted places. In 1797 he announced that the\r\nsatellites revolved round Uranus in orbits at right angles to the\r\necliptic, and in a retrograde direction. In subsequent years Herschel\r\nbelieved that he had discovered other four satellites to Uranus, but he\r\nwas unable to confirm his belief. As Mr Gore says, some of the\r\nsatellites “must, therefore, have been either optical ‘ghosts’ or else\r\nsmall fixed stars which happened to be near the planet’s path at the\r\ntime of observation. Herschel also suspected that he could see traces of\r\nrings round Uranus like those round Saturn, but his observation was\r\nnever confirmed, either by himself or other observers.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Herschel made several important observations on the Moon, and\r\nmeasured the heights of the lunar mountains, he was not a devoted\r\nstudent of our satellite. Caroline Herschel remarks in her memoirs that\r\nif it had not been for clouds or moonlight, neither her brother nor\r\nherself would have got any sleep; adding that Herschel on the moonlight\r\nnights prepared his papers or made visits to London. However, he did\r\nmake some investigations, and in 1783 and 1787 believed himself to have\r\nwitnessed the eruption of three lunar volcanoes. He afterwards\r\nconcluded, however, that what he believed to be eruptions was really the\r\nreflexion of earth-shine from the white peaks of the lunar mountains.\r\nHerschel never discovered a comet, leaving that branch of astronomy to\r\nhis sister, who discovered eight of these objects. He was, however, much\r\ninterested in comets, and attentively studied them, introducing the\r\nterms of “head,” “nucleus,” and “coma.” Herschel anticipated the view\r\nthat comets are not lasting, but are partly disintegrated at their\r\nperihelion passages. He was of opinion that they travelled from star to\r\nstar. The extent of their tails and appendages he thought to be a test\r\nof their age.\r\n\r\nWe have now completed our sketch of Herschel’s important labours\r\nregarding our Solar System. As Miss Clerke says, “A whole cycle of\r\ndiscoveries and successful investigations began and ended with him.” But\r\nthrough observing the stars he made a further discovery in connection\r\nwith the Solar System; indeed, one of the greatest discoveries in the\r\nhistory of astronomy—the movement through space of the Sun, carrying\r\nwith it planets and comets.\r\n\r\n“If the proper motion of the stars be admitted,” said Herschel, “who can\r\ndeny that of our Sun?” Of course it was plain that the motion of the Sun\r\ncould only be detected through the resulting apparent motion of the\r\nstars. Thus, if the Sun is moving in a certain direction, the stars in\r\nfront will appear to open out, while those behind will close up. But the\r\nproblem is by no means so easy as this. The stars are also in motion,\r\nand, before the solar motion can be discovered, the proper motions of\r\nthe stars—themselves very minute—have to be decomposed into two parts,\r\nthe real motion of the star, and the apparent motion, resulting from the\r\nmovement of the Solar System. To any astronomer but Herschel the problem\r\nwould have been insoluble. Only sixty years had elapsed since Halley had\r\nannounced the proper motions of the brighter stars which had been\r\npreviously supposed to be immovable—hence the name of “fixed stars.”\r\nHerschel did not deal with the motions of many stars. Only a few proper\r\nmotions were known with accuracy when he attacked the problem in 1783.\r\nMaking use of the proper motions of seven stars, and separating the real\r\nfrom the apparent motion, he found that the Solar System was moving\r\ntowards a point in the constellation Hercules, the “apex” being marked\r\nby the star λ Herculis. The rate of the solar motion, Herschel thought,\r\nwas “certainly not less than that which the Earth has in her annual\r\norbit.” This extraordinary discovery was one of Herschel’s greatest\r\nworks. “Its directness and apparent artlessness,” Miss Clerke remarks,\r\n“strike us dumb with wonder.” In 1805 Herschel again attacked the\r\nsubject, utilising the proper motions of thirty-six stars. His second\r\ninquiry, on the whole, confirmed his previous result, the “apex” being\r\nagain situated in Hercules; but the determination of 1783 was probably\r\nthe more accurate of the two.\r\n\r\nHerschel was far in advance of his time regarding the solar motion. The\r\ntwo greatest astronomers of the next generation, Bessel and Sir John\r\nHerschel, rejected the results reached by Sir William Herschel. But in\r\n1837 Argelander, after a profound mathematical discussion, confirmed\r\nHerschel’s views, and proved the solar motion to be a reality. Since\r\nthat date the problem has been attacked by various methods by Otto\r\nStruve, Gauss, Mädler, Airy, Dunkin, Ludwig Struve, Newcomb, Kapteyn,\r\nCampbell, and others, with the result that the reality of the solar\r\nmotion and of the direction fixed by Herschel has been proved beyond a\r\ndoubt. As Sir Robert Ball well remarks, mathematicians have exhausted\r\nevery refinement, “but only to confirm the truth of that splendid theory\r\nwhich seems to have been one of the flashes of Herschel’s genius.”\r\n\r\nIn his volume ‘Herschel and his Work,’ Mr James Sime writes: “To\r\nHerschel belongs the credit not merely of having suspected the\r\nrevolution of sun around sun in the far-distant realms of space, but\r\nalso of actually detecting that this was going on among the stars.”\r\nThroughout his career double stars were favourite objects of\r\nobservation. The study of double stars was commenced by Herschel while a\r\nmusician in Bath. Before his day, of course, double stars had been\r\ndiscovered and studied, but it was believed that the proximity of two\r\nstars was merely an optical accident, the brighter star being much\r\nnearer to us than the other. Herschel, at first sharing the general\r\nview, observed double stars in the hope of measuring their relative\r\nparallaxes; assuming one star to be much farther away from the Solar\r\nSystem than another, he attempted to measure the parallactic\r\ndisplacement of the brighter star relatively to the position of the\r\nfainter. “This,” he afterwards wrote, “introduced a new series of\r\nobservations. I resolved to examine every star in the heavens with the\r\nutmost attention, that I might fix my observations upon those that would\r\nbest answer my end. I took some pains to find out what double stars had\r\nbeen recorded by astronomers; but my situation permitted me not to\r\nconsult extensive libraries, nor, indeed, was it very material; for as I\r\nintended to view the heavens myself, Nature, that great volume, appeared\r\nto me to contain the best catalogue.”\r\n\r\nHerschel, on January 10, 1782, submitted to the Royal Society a\r\ncatalogue of 269 double stars: of these he himself discovered 227. In\r\nDecember 1784 he forwarded another catalogue, containing 434 stars. He\r\nsoon found that he was unable to measure stellar parallax, and the idea\r\ndawned on him that the double stars were physically connected by the law\r\nof gravitation, though he made no announcement to that effect for many\r\nyears. On July 1, 1802, Herschel informed the Royal Society that “casual\r\nsituations will not account for the multiplied phenomena of double\r\nstars.... I shall soon communicate a series of observations, proving\r\nthat many of them have already changed their situation in a progressive\r\ncourse, denoting a periodical revolution round each other.” In 1803 he\r\nshowed that many stars were revolving round their centres of gravity,\r\nproving them, in his own words, to be “intimately held together by the\r\nbond of mutual attraction.” In other words, Herschel discovered that the\r\nlaw of gravitation prevailed in the Stellar Universe, as well as in our\r\nSolar System—that the law which Newton ascertained to prevail in the\r\nSolar System extended throughout the depth of space.\r\n\r\nHerschel did not merely prove the revolution of the binary stars; he\r\nassigned periods to those which he had particularly studied. He believed\r\nthe period of Castor to be 342 years; γ Leonis 1200 years; δ Serpentis\r\n375 years; and ε Böotis 1681 years. Herschel did not compute the orbits\r\nmathematically. This was not done for nearly thirty years, when the\r\ncalculation of binary star-orbits was commenced by Savary, Sir John\r\nHerschel, and Encke.\r\n\r\nIn 1782 the French astronomer, _Charles Messier_ (1730-1817), published\r\na list of 103 nebulæ. In the following year Herschel commenced his\r\nfamous sweeps of the heavens with his large reflectors, and during these\r\nhe made many remarkable discoveries. In 1786 he published in the\r\n‘Philosophical Transactions’ of the Royal Society a catalogue of a\r\nthousand new nebulæ and star-clusters, in which he gave the position of\r\neach object with a short description of its appearance, written by\r\nCaroline Herschel while her brother actually had the object before his\r\neyes. In 1786 Herschel published a catalogue of another thousand\r\nclusters and nebulæ, followed in 1802 by a list of 500; making a total\r\nof 2500 clusters and nebulæ discovered by the great astronomer. This\r\nalone would have gained a great name for William Herschel in this branch\r\nof astronomy. In the space of only twenty years 2500 nebulæ and clusters\r\nhad been discovered. The various nebulæ and clusters were divided into\r\neight classes, as follows: the first class being “bright nebulæ,” the\r\nsecond “faint nebulæ,” the third “very faint nebulæ,” the fourth\r\n“planetary nebulæ,” so named by Herschel from their resemblance to\r\nplanetary discs, the fifth class contained “very large nebulæ,” the\r\nsixth “very compressed and rich clusters of stars,” the seventh “pretty\r\nmuch compressed clusters of large or small stars,” and the eighth\r\n“coarsely scattered clusters of stars.”\r\n\r\nAt first Herschel believed all nebulæ to be clusters of stars, the\r\nirresolvable nebulæ being supposed to be farther from our system than\r\nthe resolvable nebulæ. As many of the nebulæ which Messier could not\r\nresolve had yielded to Herschel’s instruments, Herschel believed that\r\nincrease of telescopic power would resolve the hazy spots of light which\r\nremained nebulous. In the paper of 1785, in which Herschel dealt with\r\nthe construction of the heavens, he stated his belief that many of the\r\nnebulæ were external galaxies—universes beyond the Milky Way; and in\r\n1786 he remarked that he had discovered fifteen hundred universes!\r\n\r\nArago, Mitchel, Nichol, Chambers, and other writers quite misinterpreted\r\nHerschel’s views on the nebulæ when they said that he believed them to\r\nbe all external galaxies. In 1785 Herschel believed many to be connected\r\nwith the sidereal system; considering that in some parts of the Galaxy\r\n“the stars are now drawing towards various secondary centres, and will\r\nin time separate into different clusters.” He was coming to the view\r\nthat the star-clusters were secondary aggregations within the Galaxy,\r\nprobably the true theory. He pointed out that in Scorpio, the cluster\r\nMessier 80 is bounded by a black chasm, four degrees wide, from which he\r\nbelieved the stars had been drawn in the course of time to form the\r\ncluster. His sister records that one night, after a “long, awful\r\nsilence,” he exclaimed on coming on this chasm—“Hier ist wahrhaftig ein\r\nLoch im Himmel!” (Here, truly, is a hole in the heavens.)\r\n\r\nHerschel was now gradually giving up his theory of external galaxies and\r\nhis “disc-theory” of the Universe; but he still believed even the\r\nnebulous objects to be irresolvable only through immensity of distance.\r\nIn 1791, however, he drew attention to a remarkable star in Taurus,\r\nsurrounded by a nebulous atmosphere, regarding which he wrote, “View,\r\nfor instance, the nineteenth cluster of my sixth class, and afterwards\r\ncast your eye on this cloudy star. Our judgment, I will venture to say,\r\nwill be that _the nebulosity about the star is not of a starry_\r\n_nature_. We therefore either have a central body which is not a star,\r\nor have a star which is involved in a shining fluid, of a nature totally\r\nunknown to us.” And with caution he added that “the envelope of a cloudy\r\nstar is more fit to produce a star by its condensation than to depend\r\nupon the star for its existence.”\r\n\r\nThis was written in 1791, five years before Laplace propounded his\r\nnebular theory. Meanwhile Herschel, believing that “these nebulous stars\r\nmay serve as a clue to unravel other mysterious phenomena,” found that\r\nthe theory of a “shining fluid” would suit the appearance of the\r\nirresolvable planetary nebulæ and the great nebula in Orion much better\r\nthan the extravagant idea of “external universes.” Herschel now\r\nconsidered the Orion nebula to be much nearer to the Solar System than\r\nhe formerly did, and ceased to regard it as external to the Galaxy. For\r\ntwenty years Herschel patiently observed the nebulæ, and it was not\r\nuntil 1811 that he propounded his nebular hypothesis of the evolution of\r\nthe Sun and stars. He found the gaseous matter in all stages of\r\ncondensation, from the diffused cloudy nebulæ like that in Orion,\r\nthrough the planetary nebula and the regular nebula, to the perfect\r\nstars, like Sirius and the Sun. Herschel’s nebular theory was a grand\r\nconception, and a magnificent attack on the secrets of nature.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Ball says: “Not from abstract speculation like Kant, nor from\r\nmathematical suggestion like Laplace, but from accurate and laborious\r\nstudy of the heavens, was the great William Herschel led to the\r\nconception of the nebular theory of evolution.” Herschel’s nebular\r\ntheory was wider and less rigorous than that of Laplace. Laplace reached\r\nhis theory by reasoning backwards; Herschel by observing the nebulæ in\r\nprocess of condensation. Consequently, while Laplace’s theory has\r\nrequired modification, Herschel’s, from its width, is universally\r\naccepted, because there is nothing mathematically rigorous in it. The\r\ngreat German did not go into details like his French contemporary. He\r\nsketched the evolution of the stars in a wider sense.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer’s “1500 universes,” Miss Clerke remarks, “had now\r\nlogically ceased to exist.” Herschel had gathered much evidence about\r\nnebular distribution which shattered his belief in external universes,\r\nalthough he still thought in 1818 that some galaxies were included among\r\nthe non-gaseous nebulæ. In 1784 Herschel pointed out that the clusters\r\nand nebulæ “are arranged to run in strata”; and some time later he found\r\nthat the nebulæ were aggregated near the galactic poles; in other words,\r\nwhere nebulæ are numerous, stars are scarce, and _vice versa_. So\r\nrigorously did this rule hold, that when dictating his observations to\r\nhis sister Caroline, he would, on noting a paucity of stars, warn her to\r\n“prepare for nebulæ.”\r\n\r\n“A knowledge of the construction of the heavens has always been the\r\nultimate object of my observations.” So Herschel wrote in 1811. All his\r\ninvestigations were secondary to the problem which was constantly before\r\nhis mind—the extent and structure of the Universe. He aspired to be the\r\nCopernicus of the Sidereal System. Although Bruno, Kepler, Wright, Kant,\r\nand Lambert had speculated regarding the construction of the heavens,\r\nthey had not the slightest evidence on which to base their ideas. There\r\nwas no science of sidereal astronomy. The stars were observed only to\r\nassist navigation, and the primary object of star-catalogues was to\r\nfurther knowledge of the motions of the planets. In Herschel’s day,\r\nalso, the distances of the stars had not been measured, and he had to\r\nbase his views on the distribution of the stars. In 1784, therefore, he\r\ncommenced a survey of the heavens, in order to ascertain the number of\r\nstars in various parts of the sky. This method, which he named\r\n“star-gauging,” consisted in counting the number of stars in the\r\ntelescopic field. Totally he secured 3400 gauges. His studies showed\r\nthat in the region of the Galaxy the stars were much more numerous than\r\nnear the galactic poles. Sometimes he saw as many as 588 stars in a\r\ntelescopic field, at other times only 2. He remarked that he had “often\r\nknown more than 50,000 pass before his sight within an hour.” Assuming\r\nthat the stars were, on the average, of about the same size, and\r\nscattered through space with some approach to uniformity, Herschel was\r\nable to compute the extent to which his telescope penetrated into space;\r\nand, assuming that the Universe was finite and that his\r\n“gauging-telescope” was sufficiently powerful to completely resolve the\r\nMilky Way, he was enabled to sketch the shape and extent of the\r\nUniverse.\r\n\r\nThus Herschel concluded that the Universe extended in the direction of\r\nthe Galaxy to 850 times the mean distance of stars of the first\r\nmagnitude. In the direction of the galactic poles the thickness was only\r\n155 times the distance of stars of the same magnitude. Herschel was thus\r\nenabled to sketch the probable form of the Universe, which he regarded\r\nas cloven at one of its extremities, the cleft being represented by the\r\nfamous gap in the Milky Way. The Universe was, in fact, supposed to be a\r\ncloven disc, and the Milky Way was merely a vastly extended portion of\r\nit and not a region of actual clustering. On this theory the clusters\r\nand nebulæ were supposed to be galaxies external to the Universe. Even\r\nin 1785, however, Herschel believed that there were regions in the Milky\r\nWay where the stars were more closely clustered than others. “It would\r\nnot be difficult,” he wrote in 1785, “to point out two or three hundred\r\ngathering clusters in our system.”\r\n\r\nStrange to say, Herschel’s original ideas regarding the Universe were\r\naccepted for many years by astronomical writers. Arago accepted\r\nHerschel’s original theory, unaware that he had in reality abandoned it,\r\nand he was followed by a host of French and English writers who did not\r\ntake the trouble to read each of Herschel’s papers, merely quoting that\r\nof 1785, and believing that it represented his final ideas on the\r\nsubject. Even Sir John Herschel seems to have been unaware that his\r\nfather gave up the disc theory of the Universe. The famous German\r\nastronomer, Wilhelm Struve, after an exhaustive study of Herschel’s\r\npapers, was enabled to prove in 1847 that the theory had been abandoned\r\nby Herschel; and in England the late R. A. Proctor independently\r\ndemonstrated the same thing. Meanwhile, supposing Herschel had not given\r\nup his theory, it would be quite untenable. After considering the fact\r\nthat the brighter stars, down to the ninth magnitude, aggregate on the\r\nMilky Way, Mr Gore says: “As the stars are by hypothesis supposed to be\r\nuniformly distributed throughout every part of the disc, and as the\r\nlimiting circles for stars to the eighth and ninth magnitudes fall well\r\nwithin the thickness of the disc, there is no reason why stars of these\r\nmagnitudes should not be quite as numerous in the direction of the\r\ngalactic poles as in that of the Milky Way itself. We see, therefore,\r\nthat the disc theory fails to represent the observed facts, and that\r\nStruve and Proctor were amply justified in their opinion that the theory\r\nis wholly untenable, and should be abandoned.”\r\n\r\nThe observations made by Herschel himself eventually proved fatal to the\r\ndisc theory—a hypothesis which he had all along held very lightly. His\r\nideas about subordinate clusters within the Milky Way were soon\r\nconfirmed, and though in 1799 he still adhered to the disc theory, he\r\nwrote in 1802, “I am now convinced, by a long inspection and continued\r\nexamination of it, that the Milky Way itself consists of stars very\r\ndifferently scattered from those which are immediately about us. This\r\nimmense starry aggregation is by no means uniform. The stars of which it\r\nis composed are very unequally scattered”—a conclusion quite opposed to\r\nthe disc theory, where the Milky Way was supposed to be merely an\r\nextended portion of the Universe.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 Herschel wrote as follows: “I must freely confess that by\r\ncontinuing my sweeps of the heavens, my opinion of the arrangement of\r\nthe stars, and their magnitudes, and some other particulars, has\r\nundergone a gradual change; and, indeed, when the novelty of the subject\r\nis considered we cannot be surprised that many things formerly taken for\r\ngranted should on examination prove to be different from what they were\r\ngenerally but incautiously supposed to be. For instance, an equal\r\nscattering of the stars may be admitted in certain calculations; but\r\nwhen we examine the Milky Way, or the closely compressed clusters of\r\nstars, of which my catalogues have recorded so many instances, this\r\nsupposed equality of scattering must be given up.”\r\n\r\nThis was the virtual abandonment of the disc theory. Six years later\r\nHerschel announced that in six cases he had failed to resolve the Milky\r\nWay, stating that his telescopes could not fathom it. This was the\r\nabandonment of his second assumption—namely, that his telescope was\r\nsufficiently powerful to penetrate to the limits of the Universe. Yet he\r\nstill thought that some of the star-clusters might be external galaxies,\r\nalthough he could not even dogmatically assert our Universe to be\r\nlimited. In an error of translation, Struve left the impression that\r\nHerschel believed our Universe to be unfathomable or infinite, and was\r\nobliged to devise a most artificial theory of the extinction of light to\r\naccount for the fact that the sky did not shine with the brilliance of\r\nthe Sun, which it would do were the stars infinite in number. Of course,\r\nHerschel did not actually believe the Universe to be infinite, and, had\r\nhe lived, he would probably have shown that all the star-clusters which\r\nwe see are included within the bounds of our finite Galaxy.\r\n\r\nIn 1814 Herschel was “still engaged in a series of observations for\r\nascertaining a scale whereby the extent of the Universe, as far as it is\r\npossible for us to penetrate into space, may be fathomed.” In 1817 he\r\ndescribed another method of star-gauging, which Arago and other writers\r\nhave confused with that which he devised in 1785. The two methods,\r\nhowever, were quite distinct from each other. In the first system, one\r\ntelescope was used on different regions of the heavens; whereas in the\r\nsecond method, various telescopes were used on identical regions. The\r\nprinciple was that the telescopic power necessary to resolve groups of\r\nstars indicates the distance at which the stars of the groups lie. This,\r\nhowever, also assumed an equal distribution of stars, and as the late Mr\r\nProctor says, “I conceive that no question can exist that the principle\r\nis unsound, and that Herschel would himself have abandoned it had he\r\ntested it earlier in his observing career.... In applying it, Sir W.\r\nHerschel found regions of the heavens very limited in extent, where the\r\nbrighter stars (clustered like the fainter) were easily resolved with\r\nlow powers, but where his largest telescopes could not resolve the\r\nfaintest. These regions, if the principle were true, must be long,\r\nspike-shaped star groups, whose length is directed exactly towards the\r\nastronomer on Earth,—an utterly incredible arrangement.”\r\n\r\nHerschel, at the time of his death, left unsolved the problem of the\r\nconstruction of the heavens. It is still unsolved, and will doubtless\r\nremain so until astronomers know more about the distances and motions of\r\nthe stars. His last observation of the Galaxy showed that even with his\r\n40-foot reflector he could not fathom it. Consequently, as we have\r\nmentioned, Struve and his successors regarded the Universe as infinite—a\r\ntheory which has now received its death-blow. Herschel was undoubtedly\r\ncorrect when he stated his belief in a limited Universe.\r\n\r\nHerschel’s star-gauges, and those of his son, still remain of immense\r\nvalue to astronomers in any discussion of the construction of the\r\nheavens. Thus, although they failed to reveal to Herschel the structure\r\nof the Universe, they have been of much use to his successors.\r\nHerschel’s discussion of the supreme problem—the ultimate object of his\r\nobservations—constitutes one of the most interesting chapters in the\r\nhistory of science, and marks a new era in human thought. In the words\r\nof Miss Clerke: “One cannot reflect without amazement that the special\r\nlife-task set himself by this struggling musician—originally a penniless\r\ndeserter from the Hanoverian Guard—was nothing less than to search out\r\nthe ‘construction of the heavens.’ He did not accomplish it, for that\r\nwas impossible; but he never relinquished, and, in grappling with it,\r\nlaid deep and sure the foundations of sidereal science.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                                THE SUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFour years after the death of Herschel, an apothecary in the little\r\nGerman town of Dessau procured a small telescope, with which he began to\r\nobserve the Sun. The name of this apothecary was _Samuel Heinrich\r\nSchwabe_ (1789-1875). In 1826 he commenced to observe the spots on the\r\nSun’s disc, counting them from day to day, more for self-amusement than\r\nfrom any hope of discovery; for previous astronomers had agreed that no\r\nlaw regulated the number of the sun-spots. Every clear day Schwabe\r\npointed his telescope at the Sun and took his record of the spots; this\r\nhe continued for forty-three years, until within a few years of his\r\ndeath on April 11, 1875. As early as 1843 Schwabe hinted that a possible\r\nperiod of ten years regulated the distribution of the spots on the Sun,\r\nbut no attention was given to his idea. In 1851, however, the result of\r\nhis twenty-six years of observation was published in Humboldt’s\r\n‘Cosmos,’ and Schwabe was able to show that the spots increased and\r\ndecreased in a period of about ten years. Astronomers at once recognised\r\nthe importance of Schwabe’s work, and in 1857 he was rewarded by the\r\nGold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society of London.\r\n\r\n_Rudolf Wolf_ (1813-1892) of the Zürich Observatory now undertook to\r\nsearch through the records of sun-spot observation, from the days of\r\nGalileo and Scheiner, to find traces of the solar cycle discovered by\r\nSchwabe. He was successful, and was enabled to correct Schwabe’s\r\nestimate of the length of the period, fixing it as on the average 11·11\r\nyears. Additional interest, however, was given to Schwabe’s and Wolf’s\r\ninvestigations by the remarkable discoveries which followed. In\r\nSeptember 1851 _John Lamont_ (1805-1879), a Scottish astronomer,—born at\r\nBraemar in Aberdeenshire, but employed as director of the Munich\r\nObservatory,—after searching through the magnetic records collected at\r\nGöttingen and Munich, discovered that the magnetic variations indicated\r\na period of 10⅓ years. Soon after this Sir _Edward Sabine_ (1788-1883),\r\nthe English physicist, from a discussion of an entirely different set of\r\nobservations, independently demonstrated the same thing, proving\r\nconclusively that once in about ten years magnetic disturbances reached\r\ntheir height of violence; and Sabine was not slow to notice the\r\ncorrespondence between the magnetic period and the sun-spot period. In\r\nthe same year (1852) Wolf and _Alfred Gautier_ (1793-1881) independently\r\nmade the same discovery, which had thus been made by four separate\r\ninvestigators.\r\n\r\nIn the same year an English amateur astronomer, _Richard Christopher\r\nCarrington_ (1826-1875), commenced a series of solar observations which\r\nled to some remarkable discoveries. From observations on the spots,\r\nCarrington discovered that while the Sun’s rotation was performed in 25\r\ndays at the equator, it was protracted to 27½ days midway between the\r\nequator and the poles. In 1858 Carrington demonstrated the fact that\r\nspots are scarce in the vicinity of the solar equator, but are confined\r\nto two zones on either side, becoming scarce again at thirty-five\r\ndegrees north or south of the equator. Contemporary with Carrington was\r\n_Friedrich Wilhelm Gustav Spörer_ (1822-1895), who was born in Berlin in\r\n1822 and died at Giessen, July 7, 1895. He commenced his solar\r\nobservations about the same time as Carrington, and independently\r\ndiscovered the Sun’s equatorial acceleration. From observations at his\r\nlittle private observatory at Anclam in Pomerania, continued at the\r\nAstrophysical Observatory in Potsdam, Spörer demonstrated a remarkable\r\nlaw regarding sun-spots. This law is thus described by a well-known\r\nastronomer: “The disturbance which produces the spots of a given\r\nsun-spot period first manifests itself in two belts about thirty degrees\r\nnorth and south of the Sun’s equator. These belts then draw in toward\r\nthe equator, and the sun-spot maximum occurs when their latitude is\r\nabout sixteen degrees; while the disturbance gradually and finally dies\r\nout at a latitude of eight or ten degrees. Two or three years before\r\nthis disappearance, however, two new zones of disturbance show\r\nthemselves. Thus, at the sun-spot minimum there are four well-marked\r\nspot-belts,—two near the equator, due to the expiring disturbance, and\r\ntwo in high latitudes, due to the newly beginning outbreak.” These\r\nremarkable discoveries, which resulted from the investigations of\r\nSchwabe, Carrington, and Sporer, are a brilliant example of what may be\r\ndone by amateurs in astronomy.\r\n\r\nAt the time when Carrington and Spörer were pursuing these researches,\r\nthe spectroscope came into use as an astronomical instrument, and since\r\n1859 solar astronomy has been almost entirely spectroscopic. Before we\r\ncan rightly understand the principles of spectroscopic astronomy, we\r\nmust go back to the life and work of its founder—Joseph von Fraunhofer.\r\n\r\nThe son of a poor glazier, _Joseph von Fraunhofer_ was born on March 6,\r\n1787, at Straubing, in Bavaria. His father and mother having died when\r\ntheir son was quite young, the boy, on account of his poverty, was\r\napprenticed to a looking-glass manufacturer in Munich named\r\nWeichselberger, who acted tyrannically, keeping him all day at hard\r\nwork. Still the lad borrowed some old books, and spent his nights in\r\nstudy. Young Fraunhofer lodged in an old tenement in Munich, which on\r\nJuly 21, 1801, collapsed, burying in its ruins its occupants. All were\r\nkilled but Fraunhofer, who, though seriously injured, was dug out from\r\nthe ruins four hours later. The distressing accident was witnessed by\r\nPrince Maximilian Joseph, Elector of Bavaria. He became interested in\r\nFraunhofer, and presented him with a sum of money. Of this he made good\r\nuse. He was already interested in optics, and he bought some books on\r\nthat subject, as well as a glass-polishing machine. The remainder of the\r\nmoney served to procure his release from his tyrannical master,\r\nWeichselberger.\r\n\r\nFraunhofer became acquainted with prominent scientists at Munich, who\r\nprovided him with books on optics and mathematics. Meanwhile the young\r\noptician occupied his time in shaping and finishing lenses. In 1806 he\r\nentered the optical department of the Optical and Physical Institute of\r\nMunich, and the following year, when only twenty years of age, was\r\nappointed to the chief post in that department. In 1814 he commenced his\r\ninvestigations with the prism, which have made his name famous.\r\n\r\nNewton had found that, in passing through a prism, white light is\r\ndispersed into its primary colours, making up the band of coloured light\r\nknown as the solar spectrum. But he failed to recognise the existence of\r\ndark lines in the spectrum. Casually seen in 1802 by _William Hyde\r\nWollaston_ (1786-1828), an English physicist, these lines were first\r\nthoroughly examined by Fraunhofer. Allowing light from the Sun to pass\r\nthrough a prism attached to the telescope, he was amazed to find several\r\ndark lines in the spectrum. By the year 1814 he had detected no less\r\nthan 300 or 400 of these lines. Fraunhofer named the more prominent\r\nlines by the letters of the alphabet, from A in the red to H in the\r\nviolet. They are now known as the Fraunhofer lines. At first he was much\r\nperplexed regarding the nature of the dark lines. He suspected that they\r\nmight be an optical effect, depending on the quality of the glass used,\r\nand he tried different prisms, but the lines were still to be seen. Then\r\nhe turned his prism to bright clouds to see if they were visible in\r\nreflected sunlight, and he found that they were. He examined the Moon\r\nand again perceived them, as moonlight is merely reflected sunlight; and\r\nthey were also conspicuous in the spectra of the planets. It was thus\r\nproved that these lines were characteristic of sunlight, whether direct\r\nor reflected. It was, however, still possible that they might be caused\r\nby the passage of the rays of light from the celestial bodies through\r\nthe Earth’s atmosphere. In order to test this theory, Fraunhofer\r\nexamined the spectra of the brighter stars. He found that the lines\r\nvisible in the solar spectrum were not to be seen in the spectra of the\r\nstars, thus proving that the lines were not merely an atmospheric\r\neffect. Each star, Fraunhofer observed, had a different spectrum from\r\nboth the Sun and from other stars. These spectra were also characterised\r\nby numerous dark lines, much fainter than those in the solar spectrum.\r\n\r\nAlthough he ascertained the existence of the dark lines in the Sun’s\r\nspectrum, Fraunhofer never really found out what they represented. As\r\nMiss Giberne expresses it, “Although he now saw the lines he could not\r\nunderstand them: he could not read what they said. They spoke to him\r\nindeed about the Sun, but they spoke to him in a foreign language, the\r\nkey to which he did not possess.” However, he expressed the belief that\r\nthe pair of lines in the solar spectrum, which he marked D, coincided\r\nwith the pair of bright lines emitted by incandescent sodium. Although\r\nhe doubtless suspected that the lines conveyed intelligence regarding\r\nthe elements in the Sun, he never was able properly to decipher their\r\nmeaning. Had he lived, he would probably have made the great discovery;\r\nbut these investigations were cut short by his sudden and untimely death\r\non June 7, 1826.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Fraunhofer, very little was done to forward the study\r\nof spectrum analysis. Investigations in this branch of research were\r\nmade, however, by Sir _John Herschel_ (1792-1871), _William Allen\r\nMiller_ (1817-1870), Sir _David Brewster_ (1781-1868), and others. Two\r\nfamous men of science had partly discovered the secret. These were Sir\r\n_George Stokes_ (1819-1903), of Cambridge, and _Anders John Angström_\r\n(1812-1872) of Upsala. Of Angström’s work, published in 1853, it has\r\nbeen said that it would “have obtained a high celebrity if it had\r\nappeared in French, English, or German, instead of Swedish.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1859 that the principles of spectrum analysis were\r\nfully enunciated by _Gustav Robert Kirchhoff_ (1824-1887), and his\r\ncolleague in the University of Heidelberg, _Robert Wilhelm Bunsen_\r\n(1811-1899). Kirchhoff demonstrated that a luminous solid or liquid\r\ngives a continuous spectrum, and a gaseous substance a spectrum of\r\nbright lines. In the words of Miss Clerke, “Substances of every kind are\r\nopaque to the precise rays which they emit at the same temperature. That\r\nis to say, they stop the kinds of light or heat which they are then\r\nactually in a condition to radiate.... This principle is fundamental to\r\nsolar chemistry. It gives the key to the hieroglyphics of the Fraunhofer\r\nlines. The identical characters which are written bright in terrestrial\r\nspectra are written dark in the unrolled sheaf of sun-rays.” Kirchhoff\r\nmade several determinations of the substances in the Sun, proving the\r\nexistence of sodium, iron, calcium, magnesium, nickel, barium, copper,\r\nand zinc. His great map of the solar spectrum was published by the\r\nBerlin Academy in 1860, and represented an enormous amount of labour. It\r\nwas succeeded by another map by Angström, published in 1868. But both of\r\nthese maps have been recently superseded by the investigations of Sir\r\n_Joseph Norman Lockyer_ (born 1836), and of the American physicist,\r\n_Henry Augustus Rowland_ (1848-1901). Rowland largely increased our\r\nknowledge of the elements in the solar atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope had become, by 1868, a recognised instrument of\r\nastronomical research, and in that year it was applied during the famous\r\ntotal eclipse, visible in India. There were many eclipse problems,\r\narising from the observations made by the eclipse expeditions of 1842,\r\n1851, and 1860. The eclipse of 1851 had finally proved that the red\r\nflames seen surrounding the Sun during total eclipses belonged to the\r\nSun, and not to the Moon, as many astronomers had believed. At the\r\neclipse of 1860, visible in Spain, the Italian astronomer, _Angelo\r\nSecchi_ (1818-1878), and the Englishman, _Warren De la Rue_ (1815-1889),\r\nsecured photographs of the solar prominences. The problem of 1868 was\r\nthe constitution of these prominences.\r\n\r\n_Pierre Jules César Janssen_, born in Paris in 1824, was stationed at\r\nGuntoor, in India, to observe the eclipse. He succeeded in observing the\r\nspectrum of the prominences during the progress of totality, and found\r\nit to be one of bright lines, proving the gaseous nature of the\r\nsun-flames. During the progress of the eclipse, Janssen was specially\r\nstruck by the brilliancy of the bright lines, and it occurred to him\r\nthat the prominence-spectrum could be observed in full daylight, if\r\nsufficient dispersive power was used to enfeeble the ordinary continuous\r\nspectrum. At ten o’clock on the following morning, August 19, 1868,\r\nJanssen applied his spectroscope to the sun, and observed the\r\nprominence-spectrum. After a month’s observation in India, he sent to\r\nthe French Academy an account of his success. A short time, however,\r\nbefore his report arrived, the Academy had received a similar one from\r\nLockyer, who had independently made the same discovery. Two years\r\npreviously, in 1866, the new method had occurred to him, but his\r\nspectroscope was not powerful enough; and although he ordered a more\r\npowerful one at once, it was not until October 16, 1868, that he had the\r\ninstrument in his hands. Four days later he observed the\r\nprominence-spectrum in full daylight.\r\n\r\nThe next advance in the study of the prominences was announced in 1869.\r\nJanssen and Lockyer had shown astronomers how to observe the spectrum of\r\nthe prominences; but the researches of other two famous astronomers\r\nenabled observers to see the forms of the prominences. These two men\r\nwere _William Huggins_ (born 1824) and _Johann Carl Friedrich Zöllner_.\r\nThe latter astronomer, born in Leipzig in 1834, was one of the most\r\nsuccessful students of the solar prominences. He was Professor of\r\nAstrophysics in the University of Leipzig, a position which he filled\r\nwith success until his untimely death on April 25, 1882. Independently\r\nof Huggins, he found that by opening the slit of the spectroscope wider,\r\nthe forms of the prominences themselves could be seen. The study of the\r\nprominences was at once taken up by the most famous solar observers:\r\nthese were Huggins and Lockyer in England, Spörer and Zöllner in\r\nGermany, Janssen in France, Secchi, Respighi, and Tacchini in Italy,\r\nYoung in America. To _Charles Augustus Young_ (born 1834) we owe the\r\ncareful study of individual prominences. On September 7, 1871, he\r\nobserved the most gigantic outburst on the sun ever witnessed, fragments\r\nof an exploded prominence reaching a height of 100,000 miles: Young,\r\nalso, made the first attempt to photograph the prominences.\r\n\r\nTo the Italian school of astronomers, however, we owe the persistent and\r\nsystematic study of the prominences. Among them the three greatest names\r\nare _Angelo Secchi_ (1818-1878), _Lorenzo Respighi_ (1824-1889), and\r\n_Pietro Tacchini_ (1838-1905). After the death of Secchi, the recognised\r\nhead of spectroscopy in Italy was Pietro Tacchini. Born at Modena in\r\n1838, he was appointed director at Modena in 1859, assistant at Palermo\r\nin 1863, and director at Rome in 1879. In 1870 he commenced to take\r\ndaily observations of the prominences, noting their sizes, forms, and\r\ndistribution, and these observations were continued for thirty-one\r\nyears, until within four years of Tacchini’s death, which took place on\r\nMarch 24, 1905. Tacchini did for the study of the prominences what\r\nSchwabe did for the spots. The Italian spectroscopists found that the\r\nprominences increased and decreased every eleven years in harmony with\r\nthe spots. Tacchini demonstrated that the streamers of the solar corona\r\noriginate in regions where the prominences are most numerous, and that\r\nthe shape of the corona, on the whole, varies in sympathy with the\r\nprominences.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Lockyer indicated that the prominences originated in a\r\nshallow gaseous atmosphere which he termed the chromosphere. Formerly\r\nastronomers had to observe only isolated prominences, but in 1892 an\r\nAmerican astronomer, _George Ellery Hale_ (born 1868), formerly director\r\nof the Yerkes Observatory, and now director of the Solar Observatory in\r\nCalifornia, succeeded in photographing, by an ingenious process, the\r\nwhole of the chromosphere, prominences, and faculæ visible on the solar\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nAnother solar envelope was discovered in 1870 by Dr Charles Augustus\r\nYoung, who from 1866 to 1877 directed the Observatory at Dartmouth, New\r\nHampshire, and from 1877 to 1905, that at Princeton, New Jersey. During\r\nthe eclipse of December 22, 1870, Young was stationed at Tenez de\r\nFrontena, Spain. As the solar crescent grew apparently thinner before\r\nthe disc of the Moon, “the dark lines of the spectrum,” he says, “and\r\nthe spectrum itself gradually faded away, until all at once, as suddenly\r\nas a bursting rocket shoots out its stars, the whole field of view was\r\nfilled with bright lines, more numerous than one could count. The\r\nphenomenon was so sudden, so unexpected, and so wonderfully beautiful,\r\nas to force an involuntary exclamation.” The phenomenon was observed for\r\ntwo seconds, and the impression was left on the astronomer that a bright\r\nline had taken the place of every dark one in the solar spectrum, the\r\nspectrum being completely reversed. Hence the name which was given to\r\nthe hypothetical envelope—“the reversing layer.” For long the existence\r\nof the reversing layer was disputed by numerous astronomers. In 1896\r\nphotographs taken during the solar eclipse of that year finally\r\ndemonstrated the existence of the “flash spectrum” as seen by Young.\r\n\r\nThe last of the solar appendages, the corona, can only be seen during\r\ntotal eclipses. The researches of Young and Janssen indicate that it is\r\npartly gaseous and partly meteoric in its constitution; and various\r\nphotographs, taken at the eclipses since 1870, have demonstrated its\r\nvariation in shape, which is in harmony with the eleven-year period.\r\nSeveral attempts have been made to observe the corona without an\r\neclipse. In 1882 Huggins made the attempt, but failed, and Hale, with\r\nhis photographic process, had no better success. More recently, in 1904,\r\na Russian astronomer, _Alexis Hansky_, observing from the top of Mont\r\nBlanc, secured some photographs on which he believes the corona is\r\nrepresented, but so far his observations have not been confirmed by\r\nother astronomers.\r\n\r\nThe application of the spectroscope to the motions on the solar surface\r\nis perhaps one of the most wonderful triumphs in astronomical science.\r\nIn 1842 _Christian Doppler_ (1803-1853), Professor of Mathematics at\r\nPrague, had expressed the view that the colour of a luminous body must\r\nbe changed by its motion of approach or recession. It was obvious to\r\nDoppler that if the body was approaching, a larger number of light waves\r\nmust be entering the eye of the observer than if it were retreating.\r\nMiss Clerke thus illustrates Doppler’s principle: “Suppose shots to be\r\nfired at a target at fixed intervals of time. If the marksman advances,\r\nsay, twenty paces between each discharge of his rifle, it is evident\r\nthat the shots will fall faster on the target than if he stood still;\r\nif, on the contrary, he retires by the same amount, they will strike at\r\ncorrespondingly longer intervals.” It occurred to various astronomers\r\nthat it would be possible to measure cyclones and hurricanes in the Sun,\r\nnot by change of colour in the spectrum, but by the shifting of the\r\nlines; and in 1870 this was successfully done by Lockyer. In the next\r\nfew years efforts to measure the solar rotation were made by Young,\r\nZöllner, and others, who succeeded in measuring the displacement of the\r\nlines, but not the time of rotation. This was reserved for the famous\r\nSwedish astronomer, Dunér.\r\n\r\n_Nils Christopher Dunér_, born in 1839 in Scania, was employed as an\r\nassistant at Lund Observatory from 1858 to 1888, when he was appointed\r\ndirector of the Observatory at Upsala. In that year he commenced a study\r\nof the solar rotation, measuring it by means of Doppler’s principle. He\r\nconfirmed the telescopic work of Carrington and Spörer on the equatorial\r\nacceleration, and measured the displacement up to within fifteen degrees\r\nof the poles. He brought out the surprising fact that the rotation\r\nperiod of the Sun is there protracted to 38½ days. These remarkable\r\nresearches were published in 1891.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 the Astronomer-Royal of England commenced at Greenwich\r\nObservatory to photograph the Sun daily. This work has been carried on\r\nthere by _Edward Walter Maunder_ (born 1851), and Greenwich Observatory\r\npossesses a photographic record of sun-spots. At the Meudon\r\nAstrophysical Observatory, near Paris, Janssen has, since 1876, secured\r\nphotographs of the solar surface, which were comprised in a great atlas,\r\npublished by him in January 1904. These photographs have revealed a\r\nremarkable phenomenon—the “réseau photospherique,” the distribution over\r\nthe solar surface of blurred patches of light, which Janssen considers\r\nare inherent in the Sun. The Greenwich records of sun-spots and of\r\nmagnetic disturbances have been made use of by Maunder in his remarkable\r\nstudies, promulgated in 1904, of the connection between sun-spots and\r\nterrestrial magnetism. Maunder finds that on the average magnetic storms\r\nare dependent on the presence of sun-spots, and on the size of the spot.\r\nThe magnetic action, he finds, does not radiate equally in all\r\ndirections from the sun-spots, but along definite and restricted lines.\r\n\r\nHerschel’s hypothesis of a dark and cool globe beneath the solar\r\nphotosphere was seen to be untenable after the introduction of the\r\nspectroscope. The first important theory as to the solar constitution\r\nwas that advanced in 1865 by the French astronomer, _Hervé Faye_\r\n(1814-1902). Numerous other theories were afterwards advanced by Secchi,\r\nZöllner, Young, and others, but a complete description of the various\r\ndevelopments in solar theorising cannot be given here. There is no\r\ncomplete “theory” of the exact constitution of every part of the Sun,\r\nbut the unpretentious “Views of Professor Young on the Constitution of\r\nthe Sun,” which appeared in April 1904 in ‘Popular Astronomy,’ represent\r\nthe latest ideas of the foremost solar investigator. Professor Young\r\nregards the reversing layer and the chromosphere as “simply the\r\nuncondensed vapours and gases which form the atmosphere in which the\r\nclouds of the photosphere are suspended.” He says that the contraction\r\ntheory of Helmholtz,—explained in another chapter,—advanced to explain\r\nthe maintenance of the Sun’s heat, is true so far as it goes; but that\r\nit is all the truth is now made doubtful by the discovery of radium,\r\nwhich “suggests that other powerful sources of energy may co-operate\r\nwith the mechanical in maintaining the Sun’s heat.”\r\n\r\nThe important question of the distance of the Sun was thoroughly\r\ninvestigated in 1824 by _Johann Franz Encke_ (1791-1865), then of\r\nSeeberg, near Gotha, who, from a discussion of the transits of Venus in\r\n1761 and 1769, found a parallax of 8″·571, corresponding to a mean\r\ndistance of 95,000,000 miles. This value was accepted for thirty years,\r\nuntil _Peter Andreas Hansen_ (1795-1874), in 1854, and _Urban Jean\r\nJoseph Le Verrier_ (1811-1877), in 1858, found from mathematical\r\ninvestigations that the distance indicated was too great. Preparations\r\nwere accordingly made for the observation of the transits of Venus,\r\nwhich took place respectively on December 8, 1874, and December 6, 1882.\r\nOn the first occasion many expeditions were sent to view the transit,\r\nconsisting of French, German, American, English, Scottish, Italian,\r\nRussian, and Dutch astronomers, and it was hoped that the solar parallax\r\nwould be accurately measured once for all. However, the transit,\r\nalthough favoured with good weather, was not successful, owing to the\r\ndifficulty of making exact measurements, by reason of the illumination\r\nand refraction in the atmosphere of Venus. Accordingly the values\r\ndeduced for the parallax were far from unanimous. The transit of 1882\r\nwas not observed so extensively, as astronomers had found the transit of\r\nVenus to be by no means the best method. In 1877 Sir _David Gill_ (born\r\n1843), the great Scottish astronomer, determined the solar parallax\r\nsuccessfully from measures of the parallax of Mars in opposition. His\r\nvalue was 8″·78, corresponding to 93,080,000 miles. Some years previous\r\nto this _Johann Gottfried Galle_ (born 1812), the German astronomer,\r\nhad, from measurements of the parallax of the asteroid Flora, deduced a\r\nsolar parallax of 8″·87. Gill’s work at the Cape in 1888, on the\r\nAsteroids, was successful in giving a more accurate value than the\r\ntransit of Venus: in 1900 and 1901 measures of the parallax of the\r\nasteroid Eros, the nearest minor planet, were made by many different\r\nobservatories, and agree with the other results. The values which have\r\nbeen derived from the velocity of light, and from the constant of\r\naberration, are fairly in agreement with those derived from direct\r\nmeasurement. On the whole, the most probable value of the parallax is\r\nabout 8″·8, indicating a mean distance of about 92,700,000 miles, with a\r\n“probable error” of about 150,000 miles.\r\n\r\nWhat a different picture the sun presents to us at the beginning of the\r\ntwentieth century from that which it presented to Herschel and his\r\ncontemporaries at the beginning of the nineteenth! To Herschel, the Sun\r\nwas a cool dark globe, surrounded by a luminous atmosphere. As the\r\noutcome of the researches and discoveries outlined in this chapter, the\r\nSun is now seen to be a vast central world, which is over a million\r\ntimes larger than the Earth. In the words of an able writer, “It is most\r\nprobably a world of gases, where most of the metals and metallic gases\r\nthat we know exist only as vapours, even at the Sun’s surface, hotter\r\nthan any furnace on earth, and getting a still fiercer heat for every\r\nmile of descent lower. Of that heat in the Sun’s interior we can form no\r\nconception. The pressure within the Sun is equally inconceivable. A\r\ncannon-ball weighing 100 lb. on earth would weigh 2700 on the Sun. Thus\r\na mighty conflict goes on unceasingly between imprisoned and expanding\r\ngases and vapours struggling to burst out, and massive pressures holding\r\nthem down. For reasons we cannot fully understand, no equilibrium is\r\nreached. For millions of years up-rushes and down-rushes of the\r\nwhite-hot materials have been proceeding on that bright photosphere\r\nwhich gives us light, and looks a picture of calm and quiescence. Above\r\nthat is a comparatively thin rose-coloured layer, the chromosphere,\r\nagitated with fiery ‘prominences,’ and outside all these the coronal\r\nglory—all alike pointing to immeasurable activities.”\r\n\r\nThe following remark of Professor Newcomb shows our inability to realise\r\nthe solar activity. “Suppose,” he says, “every foot of space in a whole\r\ncountry covered with 13-inch cannon, all pointed upward, and all\r\ndischarged at once. The result would compare with what is going on\r\ninside the photosphere about as much as a boy’s popgun compares with the\r\ncannon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n                               THE MOON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat remarkable that the one celestial body which Herschel\r\nneglected was our satellite, the Moon; and it is also remarkable that\r\nthe Moon was for many years the chief object of study of his\r\ncontemporary astronomer, _Johann Hieronymus Schröter_ (1745-1816). Born\r\nat Erfurt, near Hanover, on August 30, 1745, Johann Hieronymus Schröter\r\nwas originally intended for the study of law, for which he was sent to\r\nthe University of Göttingen. At the same time he studied mathematics,\r\nand particularly astronomy, under the mathematician, Kaestner of\r\nGöttingen. Deeply interested in music, he became acquainted with the\r\nHerschel family, and, inspired by William Herschel’s example, determined\r\nto study the heavens. In 1779 he became the possessor of a small\r\nachromatic refractor, and commenced to observe the Sun and Moon. In 1778\r\nhe entered the legal profession at Hanover, and four years later he was\r\nappointed “oberamtmann” or Chief Magistrate of Lilienthal—“the Vale of\r\nLilies”—in the Duchy of Bremen. At Lilienthal Schröter erected a small\r\nobservatory, and acquired in 1785 one of Herschel’s 7-foot reflectors.\r\nIn 1792 the astronomer superintended the construction of a 13-foot\r\nreflector, made by Schrader of Kiel, who transferred his workshop to\r\nLilienthal. With these instruments the great work of Schröter was\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nSchröter directed his powers of observation to the study of the Moon. He\r\noriginated the study of the surface of the Moon, and founded the branch\r\nof astronomy known as selenography, or the study of the Moon’s surface.\r\nThe foundations of this branch were laid in 1791 with the publication of\r\nSchröter’s ‘Seleno-topographische Fragmente’. The astronomer determined\r\nto make a comparative study of the surface of our satellite, and before\r\n1801 discovered eleven “rills” or clefts on the Moon’s surface, and\r\nrecognised a large number of craters. He likewise believed that he had\r\nseen a lunar atmosphere, an observation of which was made by him in\r\nFebruary 1792. Schröter seems never to have doubted what Herschel and\r\nhis contemporaries believed—that the Moon was a living world with\r\nvolcanoes in active eruption, surrounded by an atmosphere, and inhabited\r\nby beings like ourselves. Unfortunately, Schröter was not good at making\r\ndrawings of what he saw; nevertheless, he accomplished a vast amount of\r\nwork. In the little observatory at Lilienthal the foundations were laid\r\nof the comparative study of the surface of the Moon.\r\n\r\nBut these observations were destined to be rudely interrupted. In 1810\r\nHanover was occupied by the invading troops of Napoleon, and Schröter\r\nlost his appointment as Chief Magistrate of Lilienthal, and also his\r\nincome. But there was worse to follow. On April 20, 1813, three years\r\nafter, the French, under Vandamme, with that cruelty which seems to\r\nbelong to warfare, occupied Lilienthal, and set fire to the little\r\nvillage. A few days later the French soldiers entered the observatory\r\nand burned it to the ground. All Schröter’s precious observations,\r\naccumulated after thirty-four years’ labour, were destroyed with a few\r\nexceptions, the observations on Mars narrowly escaping the\r\nconflagration. Unable to forget the destruction of his observatory, and\r\nwithout the means to repair the loss, he lived only three years after\r\nthe disaster. He died on August 29, 1816, “leaving behind him,” says Mr\r\nArthur Mee, “an imperishable record, and a noble example to observers of\r\nall time.”\r\n\r\n_Wilhelm Gotthelf Lohrmann_, a land-surveyor of Dresden, continued the\r\nobservations of Schröter, and in 1824 published four of the twenty-five\r\nproposed sections of a large lunar chart. In 1827, however, his sight\r\nbegan to fail, and he was obliged to abandon his intention. But a\r\nsuccessor had already appeared on the scene. _Johann Heinrich von\r\nMädler_ (1794-1874) was born in Berlin in 1794, and, after a severe\r\nstruggle to earn a living, entered the University of Berlin in 1817. In\r\n1824 he became acquainted with _Wilhelm Beer_ (1797-1850), a wealthy\r\nbanker, who had come to him for instruction in astronomy, and who\r\nerected in 1829 an observatory near his villa in Berlin, where pupil and\r\ntutor pursued their studies.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 Mädler, with Beer’s assistance, commenced a great\r\ntrigonometrical survey of the surface of the Moon. The observations of\r\nBeer and Mädler were made with no larger instrument than a 3¾-inch\r\nrefractor. They ascertained the positions of 919 lunar spots, and\r\nmeasured the height of 1095 mountains. Their great chart of the\r\nMoon—which was afterwards followed by a smaller one—was issued in four\r\nparts during 1834-36. “The amount of detail,” wrote Proctor, “is\r\nremarkable, and the labour actually bestowed upon the work will appear\r\nincredible.” The chart has neither been revised nor superseded, and it\r\nremains to this day one of the standard works on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe chart was succeeded in 1837 by a descriptive volume entitled ‘Der\r\nMond.’ In this work Beer and Mädler did much for the progress of lunar\r\nastronomy. Their observations led to a change of opinion regarding our\r\nsatellite’s physical condition. Herschel, Schröter, Olbers, and other\r\nastronomers seem to have considered the Moon a living world. Mädler\r\ndeclared that it was a dead world. He believed it to be destitute of\r\nlife of any kind, and the changes observed by Schröter and other\r\nobservers were put down as illusions. ‘Der Mond’ was the end of Mädler’s\r\nwork in lunar astronomy, for, receiving an appointment at Dorpat, he\r\nwent there in 1846, and retained his post until within a few years of\r\nhis death, which took place at Hanover on March 14, 1874.\r\n\r\nMädler’s successor in the field of lunar astronomy was _Johann Friedrich\r\nJulius Schmidt_ (1825-1884), who was born at Eutin in Lübeck in 1825. At\r\na very early age he gave indications of a taste for astronomy.\r\nFortunately his father possessed a small hand telescope, with which\r\nyoung Schmidt commenced his lunar studies. Appointed assistant at Bonn\r\nand Olmütz and director at Athens successively, he kept up his\r\npersistent study of the surface of the Moon for over forty years. In\r\n1839, when fourteen years of age, he began the valuable series of\r\nobservations which were destined to form the basis of his great chart of\r\nthe surface of the Moon. Between 1853 and 1858, when employed at Olmütz,\r\nSchmidt made and calculated no fewer than 4000 micrometrical measures of\r\nthe altitudes of lunar mountains. Before 1866 Schmidt had found no fewer\r\nthan 278 “rills,” and his discoveries were the means of augmenting the\r\nnumber of these curious objects to nearly a thousand.\r\n\r\nIn a word, it may be said that Schmidt drew out a lunar geography, and\r\nthe result of his labours, together with those of Schröter and Mädler,\r\nis that in a sense we now know the features of the Moon better than\r\nthose of the Earth. For instance, astronomers see the whole surface of\r\nthe Moon spread before their eyes, while geographers can never have a\r\nsimilar view of the terrestrial features: we have never seen the poles\r\nof the Earth, while the lunar poles are well known to astronomers. For\r\ntwenty years after his appointment at Athens, Schmidt worked at fixing\r\nthe positions of lunar objects, measuring the heights of mountains and\r\nthe depths of craters. An idea of his enthusiasm in constructing his\r\ngreat chart may be gained from the fact that he made almost a thousand\r\noriginal sketches.\r\n\r\nMädler’s dogmatic assertion that the Moon was entirely a dead world was\r\ngenerally believed until Schmidt made observations to the contrary. From\r\n1837 to 1866 the popular opinion was that our satellite was an\r\nabsolutely dead world. Consequently there was little progress in lunar\r\nastronomy during those thirty years. Although Mädler’s view was much\r\nnearer the truth than the opinions of his predecessors, it was also too\r\npositive. His confident assertion, which was received without\r\nhesitation, was never questioned until Schmidt came upon the scene. To\r\nSchmidt the Moon was not entirely dead, and it was he who brought\r\nforward indisputable evidence as to the existence of changes on its\r\nsurface. In October 1866 he announced that the crater Linné had lost all\r\nappearance of such, and that it had become entirely effaced. Lohrmann\r\nand Mädler had observed it under a totally different aspect, as also had\r\nSchmidt himself from 1840 to 1843. There was great excitement in the\r\nastronomical world on Schmidt’s announcement, and many astronomers\r\ndenied the change, although Schmidt’s observation was confirmed by\r\nSecchi and Webb. The evidence in favour of it preponderated, and very\r\nfew observers now consider the Moon’s surface to be absolutely\r\nchangeless.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 Schmidt had begun to arrange his observations on the Moon into\r\nthe form of a chart. At first he decided to have a chart of six feet\r\ndiameter, divided, like that of Mädler, into four sections. But in April\r\n1868, on making an estimate of the value of such a chart, he was\r\ndissatisfied, and determined to construct a map of the same size divided\r\ninto twenty-five sections instead of four. He began the work in 1868,\r\nand after six years the great map was completed. After some delay the\r\nGerman Government undertook to issue the chart at their expense, and it\r\nwas published in 1879, after fourteen years of preparation. It contained\r\nno fewer than 30,000 objects, and its completed diameter was six feet\r\nthree inches—more than double the size of any previous map of the Moon.\r\nIndeed, it was probably the greatest contribution ever made to lunar\r\nastronomy. Schmidt lived only a few years after the publication of his\r\ngreat chart. He died at Athens, in his fifty-ninth year, February 8,\r\n1884.\r\n\r\nSchmidt’s announcement of the change in the appearance of Linné was\r\nfollowed in 1878 by a statement by _Hermann Joseph Klein_ (born 1842) of\r\nCologne, to the effect that a new crater had been formed to the north of\r\nthe well-known lunar crater, Hyginus. The change in this case, however,\r\nis by no means so certain as in that of Linné. It will be observed that\r\nthe majority of the students of the Moon were Germans. In England the\r\nstudy was not taken up until 1864, when a Lunar Committee of the British\r\nAssociation was appointed. Some good lunar work was done by the\r\nwell-known astronomer, _Thomas William Webb_ (1807-1885), while the\r\nstudy was popularised by _James Nasmyth_ (1808-1890), the famous\r\nengineer, who published, in 1874, in conjunction with _James Carpenter_\r\nof Greenwich Observatory, a beautifully-illustrated volume entitled ‘The\r\nMoon.’ This was succeeded, in 1876, by the larger work of _Edmund\r\nNeison_ (now Nevill), Government Astronomer of Natal. About this time\r\nseveral English astronomers, devoted to the study of the Moon, formed\r\nthemselves into the Selenographical Society. After a few years, however,\r\nthe society came to an end, and the enthusiasts formed themselves into\r\nthe lunar section of the British Astronomical Association, on the\r\nfoundation of that society in 1890. Chief among those English\r\nselenographers was _Thomas Gwyn Elger_ (1837-1897), whose observations\r\nof the Moon and drawings of the various craters were of the utmost\r\nvalue. Two years before his death, in 1895, Elger published his\r\nimportant work, ‘The Moon,’ along with an exhaustive chart of the\r\nvisible face of our satellite.\r\n\r\nHerschel and Schröter firmly believed in the existence of a lunar\r\natmosphere, the latter believing that he had actually observed the\r\nMoon’s atmospheric envelope. Early in the nineteenth century it was soon\r\nobserved, however, that on the Moon passing over and occulting stars,\r\nthese stars disappeared suddenly behind the Moon’s limb, instead of\r\ngradually, as they should have done, had an atmosphere of any density\r\nexisted. Accordingly astronomers gave up believing in a lunar\r\natmosphere. On January 4, 1865, Huggins observed with his spectroscope\r\nthe occultation of a small star in Pisces. There was not the slightest\r\nsign of absorption in a lunar atmosphere; the entire spectrum vanished\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nLunar photography was introduced as long ago as 1858 by _Lewis Morris\r\nRutherfurd_ (1816-1892), the well-known American astronomer; but for\r\nyears very little was done in this matter, although Rutherfurd secured\r\nfairly good photographs. Rutherfurd, De la Rue, and the older\r\nastronomical photographers took photographs of the entire Moon, but this\r\nplan was abandoned in favour of what Miss Clerke calls “bit by bit\r\nphotography.” About 1890 this method was introduced, and has been\r\nfollowed with success by _Maurice Loewy_ (born 1833), and his assistant,\r\nPusiex, at the Paris Observatory; by _Ladislas Weinek_ at Prague; by the\r\nastronomers of the Lick Observatory; and by _William Henry Pickering_\r\n(born 1858), the distinguished astronomer of Harvard, whose discoveries\r\nand investigations have created quite a new interest in lunar astronomy.\r\nThese investigations were commenced in 1891 at Arequipa, on the slope of\r\nthe Andes, in Peru. An occultation of Jupiter, witnessed by W. H.\r\nPickering on October 12, 1892, gave support to the view that a very\r\ntenuous lunar atmosphere does exist. In 1900 he established, near\r\nMandeville, Jamaica, a temporary astronomical station, where he obtained\r\nmany excellent photographs. Totally he secured eighty plates. These\r\nappeared, as the first complete photographic lunar atlas ever published,\r\nin his work ‘The Moon’ (1903), in which he sums up all his observations\r\nsince 1891, and concludes that “the evidence in favour of the idea that\r\nvolcanic activity upon the Moon has not yet ceased is pretty strong, if\r\nnot fairly conclusive.”\r\n\r\nPickering points out that the density of the lunar atmosphere is not\r\ngreater than one ten-thousandth of that at the Earth’s surface, and,\r\nunder these circumstances, water cannot exist above freezing-point,\r\nwhich of course brings us to the subject of snow. He considers that snow\r\nis observed on the mountain peaks and near the poles of the Moon, and he\r\nbelieves his conclusion to be verified by observations on the well-known\r\ncrater, Linné. He brings forward evidence of the probable existence on\r\nthe Moon of organic life, pointing out that the difference between the\r\nconditions of the Earth and the Moon is not so great as that above and\r\nbelow the ocean on our own planet. He has collected evidence of the\r\nexistence of something resembling vegetation on the Moon “coming up,\r\nflourishing, and dying, just as vegetation springs and withers on the\r\nEarth.”\r\n\r\nThe first successful attempt to measure the heating power of moonlight\r\nwas made in 1846 on Mount Vesuvius by _Melloni_, an Italian physicist,\r\nwhose results were confirmed four years later by _Zantedeschi_, another\r\nItalian. The most important work in this direction was accomplished by\r\nthe present _Earl of Rosse_ (born in 1840), who in the years 1869-72\r\nbelieved himself to have measured the lunar heat; but these conclusions\r\nwere not altogether confirmed by the observations of Dr _Otto\r\nBoeddicker_ (Lord Rosse’s astronomer), during the total lunar eclipse of\r\nOctober 4, 1884. Further investigations on this subject were afterwards\r\nmade by _Samuel Pierpont Langley_ (1834-1906), of Alleghany, and by his\r\nassistant, _Frank Very_.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the Moon and its perturbations were made the subject of\r\ndeep study by the famous _Pierre Simon Laplace_ (1749-1827), the\r\ncontemporary of Herschel, and the worthy successor of Newton. He devoted\r\nmuch attention to the secular acceleration of the Moon’s mean motion, a\r\nproblem which had baffled the greatest mathematicians. After a profound\r\ndiscussion he found, in 1787, that the average distance of the Earth and\r\nMoon from the Sun had been slowly increasing for several centuries, the\r\nresult being an increase in the Moon’s velocity. In the third volume of\r\nthe ‘Mécanique Céleste’ Laplace worked out the lunar theory in great\r\ndetail, although he calculated no lunar tables. After his death the\r\nsubject was taken up by _Charles Theodore Damoiseau_ (1768-1846), and\r\nthe most important advance was made by _Giovanni Antonio Amadeo Plana_\r\n(1781-1864), the director of the Turin Observatory, who published in\r\n1832 a very complete lunar theory. The work of Plana was followed by\r\nthat of _Peter Andreas Hansen_ (1795-1874), whose lunar tables were used\r\nfor the Nautical Almanac, and whom Professor Simon Newcomb considers to\r\nbe the greatest master of celestial mechanics since Laplace. The theory\r\nof the Moon’s motion was worked out in detail by the famous astronomer\r\n_Charles Eugene Delaunay_ (1816-1872), who from 1870 till 1872 occupied\r\nthe post of director of the Paris Observatory. Delaunay was about to\r\nwork out the lunar tables when, in 1872, he was accidentally drowned by\r\nthe capsizing of a pleasure-boat at Cherbourg. The work accomplished in\r\nthis direction by _Simon Newcomb_ (born 1835) is of great importance,\r\nparticularly in his correction of Hansen’s tables. _John Couch Adams_\r\n(1819-1892), one of the discoverers of Neptune, while at work on the\r\nlunar theory, had occasion to correct Laplace’s supposed solution of the\r\nacceleration of the lunar motion. On going over the calculation Adams\r\nfound that several quantities, omitted by Laplace as unimportant, showed\r\nthat the Moon has a minute increase of speed for which the theory of\r\ngravitation will not account,—a conclusion opposed by Plana, Hansen, and\r\nPontécoulant, but fully confirmed by Delaunay. Delaunay suggested in\r\n1865 that the minute apparent increase was due to the retardation of the\r\nEarth’s rotation by tidal friction. This brings us to the subject of\r\ncelestial evolution, which is discussed in another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n                           THE INNER PLANETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch progress has been made during the last hundred years in our\r\nknowledge of the planets. In fact, the study of Mercury only dates from\r\nthe commencement of the nineteenth century. Our knowledge of the\r\nvicinity of the Sun is very limited, and Mercury is difficult of\r\nobservation. So limited, in fact, is our knowledge of the Sun’s\r\nsurroundings, that it is not yet known for certain whether there is a\r\nplanet, or planets, between Mercury and the Sun. Perturbations in the\r\nmotion of the perihelion of Mercury’s orbit led Le Verrier in 1859 to\r\nthe belief that a planet of about the size of Mercury, or else a zone of\r\nasteroids, existed between Mercury and the Sun. It was, however, obvious\r\nthat such a planet could only be seen when in transit across the Sun’s\r\ndisc, or during a total eclipse. Meanwhile a French doctor, Lescarbault,\r\ninformed Le Verrier that he had seen a round object in transit over the\r\nSun’s disc. Le Verrier, certain that this was the missing planet, named\r\nit “Vulcan,” and calculated its orbit, assigning it a revolution period\r\nof twenty days. But it was never seen again. Transits of “Vulcan” were\r\nfixed for 1877 and 1882, but nothing was seen on these dates. During the\r\ntotal eclipse of July 29, 1878, two observers—_James Watson_\r\n(1838-1880), the well-known astronomer, and _Lewis Swift_ (born\r\n1820)—believed themselves to have discovered two separate planets, and\r\nultimately claimed two planets each, which were never heard of again.\r\nDuring the total eclipse of 1883 an active watch for “suspicious\r\nobjects” was kept, but with no result. At the eclipses of 1900 and 1901\r\nrespectively, photographs were exposed by the American astronomers, W.\r\nH. Pickering and _Charles Dillon Perrine_ (born 1867), but on none of\r\nthese plates could any trace of “Vulcan” be found. At the total eclipse\r\nof August 30, 1905, plates were again exposed, but no announcement has\r\nbeen made of an intra-Mercurial planet; and the prevalent opinion among\r\nastronomers is that no planet comparable with Mercury in size exists\r\nbetween that planet and the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe study of the physical appearance of Mercury was inaugurated by\r\nSchröter, who in 1800 noticed that the southern horn of the crescent\r\npresented a blunted appearance, which he attributed to the existence of\r\na mountain eleven miles in height. From observations of this mountain he\r\ncame to the conclusion that the planet rotated in 24 hours 4 minutes.\r\nThis was afterwards reduced by _Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel_ (1784-1846) to\r\n24 hours 53 seconds.\r\n\r\nAfter the time of Schröter there was no astronomer who paid much\r\nattention to either Mercury or Venus until the arrival on the scene of\r\nthe most persistent planetary observer and one of the foremost\r\nastronomers of the nineteenth century. _Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli_\r\nwas born at Savigliano, in Piedmont, in 1835, and graduated at Turin in\r\n1854. Called to Milan as assistant in the Brera Observatory in 1860, he\r\nbecame director in 1862, and there for thirty-eight years he studied\r\nastronomy in all its aspects, making a great name for himself in various\r\nbranches of the science. In 1900 he retired from the post of director,\r\nand pursues his astronomical researches in his retirement.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 Schiaparelli took up the study of Mercury in the clear air of\r\nMilan. Instead of observing the planet through the evening haze, like\r\nSchröter and others, he examined it by day, and was enabled to follow it\r\nhourly instead of looking at it for a short period when near the\r\nhorizon. At length, after seven years’ observation, he announced, on\r\nDecember 8, 1889, that Mercury performs only one rotation during its\r\nrevolution round the Sun—in fact, that its day and year coincide. As a\r\nconsequence, the planet keeps the same face towards the Sun, one side\r\nhaving everlasting day and the other perpetual night; but owing to the\r\nlibratory movement of Mercury—the result of uniform motion on its axis\r\nand irregular motion in its orbit—the Sun rises and sets on a small zone\r\nof the planet’s surface. Schiaparelli’s observations indicated that\r\nMercury is a much spotted globe, with a moderately dense atmosphere, and\r\nhe was enabled to form a chart of its surface-markings.\r\n\r\nSchiaparelli’s conclusions remained until 1896 unconfirmed and yet not\r\ndenied, although most astronomers were sceptical on the subject. In 1896\r\nthe subject was taken up by the American astronomer, _Percival Lowell_\r\n(born 1855), who, in the clear air of Arizona, confirmed Schiaparelli’s\r\nconclusions, fixing 88 days as the period of rotation. He remarked,\r\nhowever, that no signs of an atmosphere or clouds were visible to him.\r\nThe surface of Mercury, he says, is colourless,—“a geography in black\r\nand white.” The determination of the rotation period by Schiaparelli and\r\nLowell is now generally accepted, and is confirmed by the theory of\r\ntidal friction. It is only right to add that _William Frederick Denning_\r\n(born 1848) in 1881 suspected a rotation period of 25 hours, but this\r\nremains unconfirmed. In April 1871 the spectrum of Mercury was examined\r\nby _Hermann Carl Vogel_ (born 1842) at Bothkamp. He suspected traces of\r\nan atmosphere similar to ours, but was not certain. Of more interest are\r\nthe photometric observations of Zöllner in 1874. These observations\r\nindicated that the surface of Mercury is rugged and mountainous, and\r\ncomparable with the Moon,—a conclusion supported by Lowell’s\r\nobservations in 1896.\r\n\r\nVenus, the nearest planet to the Earth, has been attentively studied for\r\nthree centuries, and still comparatively little is known regarding it.\r\nThis is due to its remarkable brilliancy, combined with its proximity to\r\nthe Sun. The great problem at the beginning of the nineteenth century\r\nwas the rotation of the planet. In 1779 the subject was taken up by\r\nSchröter at Lilienthal. Nine years later, from a faint streak visible on\r\nthe disc, he concluded that rotation was performed in 23 hours 28\r\nminutes, and in 1811 this was reduced by seven minutes; but as Herschel\r\nwas unable to observe the markings seen by Schröter, many astronomers\r\nwere inclined to be sceptical regarding the accuracy of the Lilienthal\r\nobservers results. Schröter also observed the southern horn of Venus\r\nwhen in the crescent form to be blunted, and he ascribed this to the\r\nexistence of a great mountain, five or six times the elevation of\r\nChimborazo; while he observed irregularities along the terminator, which\r\nhe considered to be more strongly marked than those on the Moon.\r\nSchröter’s opinion on this point, although rejected by Herschel, was\r\nconfirmed by Mädler, Zenger, Ertborn, Denning, and by the Italian\r\nastronomer _Francesco Di Vico_ (1805-1848), director of the Observatory\r\nof the Collegio Romano. In 1839 Di Vico attacked the problem of the\r\nrotation, and his results were confirmatory of those of Schröter. He\r\nestimated that the axis of Venus was inclined at an angle of 53° to the\r\nplane of its orbit. Meanwhile a series of important observations had\r\nbeen made on Venus by the Scottish astronomer and theologian, _Thomas\r\nDick_ (1772-1857), who suggested daylight observations on Venus to solve\r\nthe problem of the rotation.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 the question was attacked by Schiaparelli, who commenced a\r\nseries of observations on Venus at Milan in that year. The results of\r\nhis studies were summed up in 1890 in five papers contributed to the\r\nMilan Academy. He came to the conclusion that the markings observed by\r\nSchröter, Di Vico, and others were not really permanent, and\r\nconcentrated his attention on round white spots, which remained fixed in\r\nposition. Instead of observing Venus in the evening, Schiaparelli\r\nfollowed it by day, watching it continuously on one occasion for eight\r\nhours. But the markings remained fixed. Schiaparelli accordingly\r\nconcluded that the planet’s rotation was performed in probably 225 days,\r\nequal to the time of revolution. One face is turned towards the Sun\r\ncontinually, while the other is perpetually in darkness.\r\n\r\nThe announcement was so startling that, as Miss Clerke says, “a clamour\r\nof contradiction was immediately raised, and a large amount of evidence\r\non both sides of the question has since been collected.” Perrotin at\r\nNice, Tacchini at Rome, Cerulli at Teramo, Mascari at Catania and Mount\r\nEtna, and Lowell in Arizona, all in favourable climates, confirmed\r\nSchiaparelli’s results, as also did a second series of observations by\r\nthe Milan astronomer himself in 1895. On the other hand, Neisten,\r\nTrouvelot, _Camille_ _Flammarion_ (born 1842), and others, under less\r\nfavourable climatic conditions, arrived at a period of 24 hours.\r\n_Aristarch Bélopolsky_ (born 1854), from spectroscopic observations at\r\nPulkowa, by means of Doppler’s principle, found a period of 12 hours.\r\nLowell, by the same principle, found, in 1901-03, a period of 225 days,\r\nin agreement with Schiaparelli’s results. This is the last word on the\r\nsubject. Schiaparelli’s rotation period, confirmed by the theory of\r\ntidal friction, is generally accepted.\r\n\r\nThat Venus has an atmosphere was one of the conclusions reached by\r\nSchröter in 1792; and in this at least he was correct, as the atmosphere\r\nof Venus, illuminated by the solar rays, has been seen extending round\r\nthe entire disc of the planet. Spectroscopic observations by Tacchini,\r\nRicco, and Young, during the transits of 1874 and 1882, indicated the\r\nexistence of water-vapour in the planet’s atmosphere. Very little has\r\nbeen discovered regarding the “geography” of Venus. White patches at the\r\nsupposed “poles” of the planet were observed in 1813 by _Franz von\r\nGruithuisen_, and in 1878 by the French astronomer _Trouvelot_\r\n(1827-1895). The secondary light of Venus, similar to the “old Moon in\r\nthe new Moon’s arms,” was repeatedly observed since the time of Schröter\r\nby Vogel, Lohse, Zenger, and others. Vogel attributed it to twilight,\r\nand Lamp, a German observer, to electrical processes analogous to our\r\nauroræ. In 1887 a Belgian astronomer, _Paul Stroobant_, submitted to a\r\nsearching examination all the supposed observations of a satellite of\r\nVenus, and was enabled to explain nearly all the supposed satellites as\r\nsmall stars which happened to lie near the planet’s path in the sky at\r\nthe time of observation.\r\n\r\nThe study of our own planet can hardly be said to belong to the realm of\r\nastronomy. Nevertheless, it is through astronomical observation that the\r\nmotion of the North Pole has been discovered. For many years it has been\r\na problem whether there is a variation of latitude resulting from the\r\nmotion of the pole. Euler had declared, from theoretical investigation,\r\nthat, were there such a motion, the period must be 10 months. The\r\nquestion was revived in 1885 by the observations of _Seth Carlo\r\nChandler_ (born 1846) at Cambridge, Mass., with his newly-invented\r\ninstrument, the “almucantar,” which indicated an appreciable variation\r\nof latitude. This was confirmed by _Friedrich Küstner_ (born 1856), now\r\ndirector of the Observatory at Bonn. The idea now occurred to Chandler\r\nto search through the older records to discover if there was any trace\r\nof the variation of latitude, with the result that he brought out a\r\nperiod of 14 months instead of 10. This aroused much interest, and many\r\nprominent astronomers denied Chandler’s results, which were announced in\r\n1891. As a well-known astronomer has expressed it, “Euler’s work had\r\nshown what period the motion must have, and any appearance of another\r\nperiod must be due to some error in the observations. Chandler replied\r\nto the effect that he did not care for Euler’s mathematics: the\r\nobservations plainly showed 14 months, and if Euler said 10, _he_ must\r\nhave made the mistake. I do not exaggerate the situation in the least;\r\nit was a deadlock: Chandler and observation against the whole weight of\r\nobservation and theory.” It was now shown by Newcomb that Euler had\r\nassumed the Earth to be an absolutely rigid body, while modern\r\ninvestigations show that it is not so. Chandler’s discovery is now\r\naccepted, and proves that the North Pole is not fixed in position, but\r\nhas a small periodic motion, though never twelve yards from its mean\r\nposition. That the small resulting variation in the position of the\r\nstars has been noticed at all is a striking illustration of the accuracy\r\nof astronomical observation.\r\n\r\nOf all the planets Mars has been most studied during the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Many illustrious astronomers have devoted years to the study of\r\nthe red planet, with the result that more is known of the surface of\r\nMars than of any other celestial body, with the exception of the Moon.\r\nAfter the time of Herschel, the leading students of Mars were Beer and\r\nMädler, who carefully studied the planet from 1828 to 1839. They\r\nidentified at each opposition the same dark spots, frequently obscured\r\nby mists, and they also made the most accurate determination of the\r\nrotation period, which they fixed at 24 hours 37 minutes 23 seconds.\r\nThis estimate was confirmed in 1862 by _Friedrich Kaiser_ (1808-1872) of\r\nLeyden, in 1869 by _Richard Anthony Proctor_ (1837-1888), and in 1892 by\r\n_Henricius Gerardus van de Sande Bakhuyzen_ (born 1838), director of the\r\nLeyden Observatory. In 1862 Lockyer identified the various markings seen\r\nby Beer and Madler in 1830. The other great names in Martian study prior\r\nto 1877 are Angelo Secchi and _William Rutter Dawes_ (1799-1868), who\r\nstudied Mars from 1852 to 1865 and secured a very valuable series of\r\ndrawings. These drawings were used by Proctor for the construction of\r\nthe first reliable map of Mars, which was published in 1870 in his work,\r\n‘Other Worlds than Ours.’ Proctor gave names to the various Martian\r\nfeatures, the reddish-ochre portions of the disc being named continents\r\nand the bluish-green portions seas; and Proctor’s views on Mars found\r\nfavour for many years. In 1877, however, Schiaparelli opened a new era\r\nin the study of Mars. In September of that year, during the very\r\nfavourable opposition of the planet, Schiaparelli, while executing a\r\ntrigonometrical survey of the disc, discovered that the continents were\r\ncut up by numerous long dark streaks, which he called _canali_. In 1879,\r\nto his surprise, he found that some of the canals had become double; and\r\nhe confirmed this in 1881 and at subsequent oppositions. Meanwhile, as\r\nSchiaparelli was the only observer who had hitherto seen the canals,\r\nthere was much scepticism as to their reality. In 1886, however, they\r\nwere seen at the Nice Observatory by _Henri Perrotin_ (1845-1904), who\r\nalso observed their duplication. Since 1886 they have been observed by\r\nmany astronomers, including Camille Flammarion in France, _William\r\nFrederick Denning_ (born 1848) in England, _Vincenzo Cerulli_ (born\r\n1859) in Italy, Percival Lowell and W. H. Pickering in the United\r\nStates. In 1892 W. H. Pickering successfully observed the canals, and\r\ndiscovered at the junctions of two or more canals round black spots, to\r\nwhich he gave the name of “lakes,” in keeping with the view that the\r\ndark regions of the planet were seas.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 Percival Lowell erected at Flagstaff, Arizona, an observatory\r\nfor the specific purpose of observing Mars and its canals in good and\r\nsteady air. He was assisted by W. H. Pickering and by _Andrew Ellicott\r\nDouglass_ (born 1867). During a year’s study Douglass measured the\r\nMartian atmosphere and discovered canals crossing the dark regions of\r\nthe planet, finally disproving the idea of their aqueous character.\r\nLowell recognised all Schiaparelli’s canals, and discovered many more.\r\nHe also attentively studied the south polar cap of Mars, which\r\ndisappeared entirely on October 12, 1894. Lowell noticed, also, that as\r\nthe cap melted the canals became darker, as if water was being conveyed\r\ndown; and accordingly he adopted the view put forward by Schiaparelli,\r\nthat the canals are waterways lined on either side by banks of\r\nvegetation. His observations were published in the end of 1895 in his\r\nwork ‘Mars.’ He is of opinion that the reddish-ochre regions or\r\n“continents” are deserts, and the greenish areas marshy tracts of\r\nvegetation. The lakes are named by him “oases,” and, as Miss Clerke\r\nobserves, he “does not shrink from the full implication of the term.” He\r\nregards the canals as strips of vegetation fertilised by a small canal,\r\nmuch too small to be seen, an idea which originated with W. H.\r\nPickering. The canals are believed by Lowell to be waterways down which\r\nthe water from the melting polar cap is conveyed to the various oases.\r\nHe considers, in fact, that the canals are constructed by intelligent\r\nbeings with the express purpose of fertilising the oases, regarded by\r\nhim as centres of population. He remarks that water is scarce on the\r\nplanet, owing to its small size, and as a consequence the inhabitants\r\nare forced to utilise every drop. The canal system is the result.\r\n\r\nLowell’s theory has not been cordially received—although it is now\r\ngradually gaining popularity,—and several other hypotheses have been\r\npropounded to explain the canals. Proctor, who died some years before\r\nLowell’s theory was given to the world, regarded them as rivers, but\r\nthis view may now be looked upon as abandoned. It was suggested that the\r\ncanals might be cracks in the surface of Mars or meteors ploughing\r\ntracks above it: and Professor _John Martin Schaeberle_ (born 1853) of\r\nthe Lick Observatory put forward the view that the canals were chains of\r\nmountains running over the light and dark regions. None of these\r\ntheories, however, gained popularity, and had to give way to a more\r\npopular theory, the “illusion” hypothesis, put forward by the Italian\r\nastronomer Cerulli, and supported by Newcomb and Maunder. On the basis\r\nof the illusion theory, Newcomb explains that the “canaliform”\r\nappearance “is not to be regarded as a pure illusion on the one hand or\r\nan exact representation of objects on the other. It grows out of the\r\nspontaneous action of the eye in shaping slight and irregular\r\ncombinations of light and shade, too minute to be separately made out\r\ninto regular forms.” Experiments were made by Maunder in 1902, and the\r\nresults pointed to the truth of the theory that the canals were really\r\nillusions. But the studies of Lowell at the oppositions of 1903 and 1905\r\nhave seriously weakened the hypothesis of Cerulli and Maunder, and\r\nstrongly confirm the theory of the artificial origin of the canals. In\r\n1903 Lowell was enabled, from a study of the development of the canals,\r\nto show the probability of their artificial nature, and his study of the\r\ndouble canals showed a distinct plan in their distribution. Finally, on\r\nMay 11, 1905, several photographs of Mars were secured at the Lowell\r\nObservatory, on which the canals appeared, not as dots of light and\r\nshade, as on the illusion theory, but as straight dark lines. This goes\r\nfar to prove the reality of the canals,—in spite of the ridicule cast on\r\nthem and their observers,—and consequently the truth of the theory of\r\nintelligent life in Mars.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the old-fashioned Martian observations have been continued in\r\nless favourable climates than Arizona and Italy by various astronomers,\r\namong them the famous Camille Flammarion, the American astronomers\r\n_James Edward Keeler_ (1857-1900), _Edward Emerson Barnard_ (born 1857),\r\nthe English astronomer W. F. Denning, and others. These conscientious\r\nand painstaking observers have done much for Martian study in increasing\r\nthe number of accurate delineations of the Martian surface.\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of Mars was first examined by Huggins in 1867. He found\r\ndistinct traces of water-vapour, and this was confirmed by Vogel in\r\n1872, and by Maunder some years later. In 1894, however, _William\r\nWallace Campbell_ (born 1862), the American astronomer, observing from\r\nthe Lick Observatory, California, was unable to detect the slightest\r\ndifference between the spectra of Mars and the Moon, indicating that\r\nMars had no appreciable atmosphere; and from this he deduced that the\r\nMartian polar caps could not be composed of snow and ice, but of frozen\r\ncarbonic acid gas. In 1895, however, Vogel confirmed his previous\r\nobservations, and reaffirmed the presence of water-vapour in the Martian\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nDuring the opposition of 1830, Mädler undertook an extensive search for\r\na Martian satellite, but was unsuccessful. In 1862 the search was\r\nresumed by _Heinrich Louis D’Arrest_ (1822-1875), the famous German\r\nobserver, who was also unsuccessful. Accordingly the red planet was\r\nreferred to by Tennyson as the “moonless Mars.” In 1877 the search was\r\ntaken up by _Asaph Hall_, the self-made American astronomer, born at\r\nGoshen, Connecticut, in 1829, and employed from 1862 to 1891 at the\r\nNaval Observatory, Washington. During the famous opposition of August\r\n1877, favoured by the great 26-inch refractor, he succeeded in\r\ndiscovering two very small satellites of Mars, to which he gave the\r\nnames of Phobos and Deimos. He determined the time of revolution of\r\nPhobos at 7 hours 39 minutes, and that of Deimos at 30 hours 17\r\nminutes,—Phobos revolving round Mars more than three times for one\r\nrotation of the planet on its axis. These two satellites are very small,\r\nnot more than thirty miles in diameter. After Hall’s successful search,\r\nphotographs were exposed at the Paris Observatory for other Martian\r\nsatellites, but none was discovered. No further moons have been found\r\nbelonging to the red planet, nor is it likely that any further\r\nsatellites of Mars are in existence.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of a zone of small planets in the space between Mars and\r\nJupiter belongs completely to the nineteenth century, although the\r\nexistence of a planet in the vacant space was suspected three centuries\r\nago. In 1772 the subject was taken up by _Johann Elert Bode_\r\n(1747-1826), afterwards director of the Berlin Observatory, who\r\ninvestigated a curious numerical relationship, since known as Bode’s\r\nLaw, connecting the distances of the planets. If four is added to each\r\nof the numbers—0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, and 192, the resulting series\r\nrepresents pretty accurately the distances of the planets from the Sun,\r\nthus—4 (Mercury), 7 (Venus), 10 (The Earth), 16 (Mars), 28, 52,\r\n(Jupiter), and 100 (Saturn). After the discovery of Uranus, in 1781, it\r\nwas found that it filled up the number 196. Bode, however, saw that the\r\nnumber 28, between Mars and Jupiter, was vacant, and predicted the\r\ndiscovery of the planet. Aided by _Franz Xavier von Zach_ (1754-1832),\r\nhe called a congress of astronomers, which assembled in 1800 at\r\nSchröter’s observatory at Lilienthal, when, for the purpose of searching\r\nfor the missing planet, the zodiac was divided into twenty-four zones,\r\neach of which was given to a separate astronomer. One of them was\r\nreserved for _Giuseppe Piazzi_ (1746-1826), director of the Observatory\r\nof Palermo.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1746 at Ponte, in Lombardy, Giuseppe Piazzi, after entering the\r\nTheatine Order of monks, became in 1780 Professor of Mathematics at\r\nPalermo, where an observatory was erected in 1791; and at that\r\nobservatory Piazzi worked till his death in 1826. In 1792 he commenced a\r\ngreat star-catalogue, and while making his nightly observations he\r\ndiscovered, on January 1, 1801—the first night of the nineteenth\r\ncentury,—what he took to be a tailless comet, but which proved to be a\r\nsmall planet revolving round the sun in the vacant space. The discovery\r\nwas hailed by Bode and Von Zach with much enthusiasm, and Piazzi named\r\nthe planet Ceres. The little planet was, however, soon lost in the rays\r\nof the sun before sufficient observations had been made; but the great\r\nmathematician, _Friedrich Gauss_ (1777-1855), came to the rescue, and\r\npointed out the spot where the planet was to be rediscovered. In that\r\nspot it was found on December 31, 1801, by Von Zach at Gotha, and on the\r\nfollowing evening by _Heinrich Olbers_ (1758-1840) at Bremen.\r\n\r\nOn March 28, 1802, while observing Ceres from his house at Bremen,\r\nOlbers was struck by the presence of a strange object near the path of\r\nthe planet. At first he supposed it to be a variable star at maximum\r\nbrilliance, but a few hours showed him that it was in motion, and was\r\ntherefore another planet. He named it Pallas, and propounded the theory\r\nthat the two “Asteroids”—so named by Herschel—were fragments of a\r\ntrans-Martian planet, which, through some accident, had been shattered\r\nto pieces in the remote past. Olbers urged the necessity of searching\r\nfor more small planets. His advice was taken. In 1804 _Karl Ludwig\r\nHarding_ (1765-1834), Schröter’s assistant, discovered Juno, and Olbers\r\nhimself detected Vesta, March 29, 1807.\r\n\r\nAfter 1816 the search was relinquished, as no more planets were\r\ndiscovered. In 1830, however, a German amateur, _Karl Ludwig Hencke_\r\n(1793-1866), ex-postmaster of Driessen, commenced a search for new\r\nplanets, which was rewarded, after fifteen years, by the discovery of\r\nAstræa, December 8, 1845. On July 1, 1847, he made another discovery,\r\nthat of Hebe. A few weeks later, _John Russell Hind_ (1823-1895), the\r\nEnglish astronomer, discovered Iris. Since 1847 not a year has passed\r\nwithout one or more planets being found, sometimes as many as twenty\r\nbeing discovered in a single year. Some astronomers have made the search\r\nfor asteroids their chief business. The principal asteroid discoverers\r\nhave been _Christian H. F. Peters_ (1813-1890), Henri Perrotin, _Paul\r\nHenry_ (1848-1905), _Prosper Henry_ (1849-1903), James Watson, _Robert\r\nLuther_ (1822-1900), _Johann Palisa_ (born 1848), and _Max Wolf_ (born\r\n1863).\r\n\r\nIn 1891 a new impulse was given to asteroid study by the application of\r\nphotography by Max Wolf to the discovery of the minor planets. It\r\noccurred to Wolf that the asteroid would be represented on the plate by\r\na trail, caused by its motion during the time of exposure; and assisted\r\nby _Arnold Schwassmann_ (born 1870), _Luigi Carnera_ (born 1875), and\r\nothers, Wolf has discovered over a hundred asteroids, and he has the\r\nwhole field of asteroid hunting to himself. Few minor planets are now\r\ndiscovered by the older method. In 1901 Wolf invented his new instrument\r\nof research, the stereo-comparator, which, on the principle of the\r\nold-fashioned stereoscope, represents the planetary bodies as suspended\r\nin space far in front of the stars. In this way this ingenious\r\nastronomer has been enabled to discover asteroids at the first glance:\r\nyear by year fresh discoveries are announced from the Heidelberg\r\nObservatory, until more than five hundred asteroids are now known.\r\n\r\nWaning interest in the ever-increasing family of asteroids was revived\r\nin 1898 by the discovery by _Karl Gustav Witt_ (born 1866) of a small\r\nplanet, to which he gave the name of Eros, which comes nearer to the\r\nEarth than Mars, and which is of great assistance to astronomers in the\r\ndetermination of the solar parallax. For some time prior to 1898\r\nastronomers had considered it a waste of time to search for new\r\nasteroids; but this idea is not now so popular, in view of the benefit\r\nconferred on astronomy by the discovery of Eros.\r\n\r\nOf the physical nature of the asteroids astronomers know nothing. Only\r\nthe four largest have been measured. For many years it was supposed that\r\nVesta, the brightest of the asteroids, was also the largest. The\r\nmeasures of Barnard with the great Lick refractor in 1895, however,\r\nshowed that Ceres is the largest, with a diameter of 477 miles. Pallas\r\ncomes next, with a diameter of 304 miles; while the diameters of Vesta\r\nand Juno are respectively 239 and 120 miles. Barnard saw no traces of\r\natmosphere round any of the asteroids. It should be stated that in 1872\r\nVogel thought he could detect an “air-line” in the spectrum of Vesta: he\r\nadmitted that the observation required confirmation, but it has not been\r\ncorroborated either by himself or any other observer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n                           THE OUTER PLANETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nJupiter, the greatest planet of the Solar System, has perhaps been more\r\npersistently studied by astronomers than any other. In the early\r\nnineteenth century the prevalent idea was that Jupiter was a world\r\nsimilar to the Earth, only much larger,—a view held by Herschel and\r\nother famous astronomers, and put forward by Brewster in ‘More Worlds\r\nthan One.’ This view prevailed for many years, although Buffon in 1778,\r\nand Kant in 1785, had stated their belief in the idea that Jupiter was\r\nstill in a state of great heat—in fact, that the great planet was a\r\nsemi-sun. This idea, however, was long in being adopted by astronomers,\r\nand very little attention was paid to Nasmyth’s expression of the same\r\nopinion in 1853. The older view still held the field—namely, that the\r\nbelts of Jupiter represented trade-winds, and that a world similar to\r\nthe terrestrial lay below the Jovian clouds. In 1860 _George Philip\r\nBond_ (1826-1865), director of the Harvard Observatory, found from\r\nexperiments that Jupiter seemed to give out more light than it received,\r\nbut he did not dare to suggest that Jupiter was self-luminous,\r\nconsidering that the inherent light might result from Jovian auroras.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 Zöllner showed that the rapid motions of the cloud-belts on both\r\nJupiter and Saturn indicated a high internal temperature. At the\r\ndistance of Jupiter sun-heat is only one twenty-seventh as great as on\r\nthe Earth, and would be quite incapable of forming clouds many times\r\ndenser than those on the Earth. In 1871 Zöllner drew attention to the\r\nequatorial acceleration of Jupiter, analogous to the same phenomenon on\r\nthe Sun. In 1870 these opinions of Zöllner’s were adopted and supported\r\nby Proctor in his ‘Other Worlds than Ours.’ In his subsequent volumes\r\nProctor did much to popularise the idea, which is now accepted all over\r\nthe astronomical world.\r\n\r\nDuring the century many valuable observations on Jupiter were made by\r\nnumerous observers, among them Airy, Mädler, Webb, Schmidt, and others.\r\nMuch time was devoted to the accurate determination of the rotation\r\nperiod, which was fixed at 9 hours 55 minutes 36·56 seconds by Denning\r\nin observations from 1880 to 1903. No really important discovery was\r\nmade till 1878, when Niesten at Brussels discovered the “great red\r\nspot,” a ruddy object 25,000 miles long by 7000 broad, attached to a\r\nwhite zone beneath the southern equatorial belt. This remarkable object\r\nhas been observed ever since. In 1879 its colour was brick-red and very\r\nconspicuous, but it soon began to fade, and Riccó’s observation at\r\nPalermo in 1883 was thought to be the last. After some months, however,\r\nit brightened up, and, notwithstanding changes of form and colour, it is\r\nstill visible, a permanent feature of the Jovian disc. In 1879 a group\r\nof “faculæ,” similar to those on the Sun, was observed at Moscow by\r\n_Theodor Alexandrovitch Brédikhine_ (1831-1904), and at Potsdam by\r\n_Wilhelm Oswald Lohse_ (born 1845). It was soon observed that the\r\nrotation period, as determined from the great red spot, was not\r\nconstant, but continually increasing. A white spot in the vicinity\r\ncompleted its rotation in 5½ minutes less, indicating the differences of\r\nrotation on Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe great red spot has been observed since its discovery by Denning at\r\nBristol and _George Hough_ (born 1836) at Chicago. Twenty-eight years of\r\nobservation have not solved the mystery of its nature. The researches\r\nmade on it, in the words of Miss Clerke, “afforded grounds only for\r\nnegative conclusions as to its nature. It certainly did not represent\r\nthe outpourings of a Jovian volcano; it was in no sense attached to the\r\nJovian soil—if the phrase have any application to the planet; it was not\r\na mere disclosure of a glowing mass elsewhere seethed over by rolling\r\nvapours.”\r\n\r\nIn 1870 _Arthur Cowper Ranyard_ (1845-1894), the well-known English\r\nastronomer, began to collect records of unusual phenomena on the Jovian\r\ndisc to see if any period regulated their appearance. He came to the\r\nconclusion that, on the whole, there was harmony between the markings on\r\nJupiter and the eleven-year period on the Sun. The theory of inherent\r\nlight in Jupiter, however, has not been confirmed. The great planet was\r\nexamined spectroscopically by Huggins from 1862 to 1864, and by Vogel\r\nfrom 1871 to 1873. The spectrum showed, in addition to the lines of\r\nreflected sunlight, some lines indicating aqueous vapour, and others\r\nwhich have not been identified with any terrestrial substance. A\r\nphotographic study of the spectrum of Jupiter was made at the Lowell\r\nObservatory by Slipher in 1904, probably the most exhaustive\r\ninvestigation on the subject. The spectroscope has, however, given\r\nlittle support to the theory of inherent light, and “we are driven to\r\nconclude that native emissions from Jupiter’s visible surface are local\r\nand fitful, not permanent and general.”\r\n\r\nHerschel’s idea, that the rotations of the four satellites of Jupiter\r\nwere coincident with their revolutions, has on the whole been confirmed\r\nby recent researches, although in the case of the two near satellites\r\n(Io and Europa) W. H. Pickering’s observations in 1893 indicated shorter\r\nrotation periods. There is much to learn regarding the geography of the\r\nsatellites, although in 1891 Schaeberle and Campbell at the Lick\r\nObservatory observed belts on the surface of Ganymede, the third\r\nsatellite analogous to those on Jupiter. Surface-markings on the\r\nsatellites have also been seen by Barnard at the Lick Observatory, and\r\nby Douglass at Flagstaff.\r\n\r\nSince the time of Galileo no addition had been made to the system of\r\nsatellites revolving round Jupiter. Profound surprise was created,\r\ntherefore, by the announcement of the discovery of a fifth satellite by\r\nBarnard at the Lick Observatory, on September 9, 1892. The satellite,\r\none of the faintest of telescopic objects, was discovered with the great\r\n36-inch telescope, and its existence was soon confirmed by _Andrew\r\nAnslie Common_ (1841-1903), with his great 5-foot reflector at Ealing,\r\nnear London. The new satellite was found by Barnard to revolve round\r\nJupiter in 11 hours 57 minutes at a mean distance of 112,000 miles.\r\n\r\nAlthough the existence of other satellites of Jupiter was predicted by\r\nSir _Robert Stawell Ball_ (born 1840) soon after the discovery of the\r\nfifth, much surprise was created by the announcement, in January 1905,\r\nthat a sixth satellite had been discovered by Perrine, who, in the\r\nfollowing month, announced the discovery of a seventh. These discoveries\r\nwere made by photography, the objects being very faint. The periods of\r\nrevolution were found to be 242 days and 200 days for the sixth and\r\nseventh satellites respectively, the mean distances being 6,968,000 and\r\n6,136,000 miles. It is possible that they may belong to a zone of\r\nasteroidal satellites. In fact, the fifth moon may belong to a similar\r\nzone, so that Jupiter may have two asteroidal zones; but this is\r\nanticipating future discovery.\r\n\r\nA particular charm has always attached itself to the study of Saturn,\r\nthe ringed planet. The magnificent system of rings has for two and a\r\nhalf centuries been the object of wonder and admiration in the Solar\r\nSystem, and accordingly they have been exhaustively studied by many\r\neminent observers. While observing the two bright rings of Saturn on\r\nJune 10, 1838, Galle noticed what Miss Clerke calls “a veil-like\r\nextension of the lucid ring across half the dark space separating it\r\nfrom the planet.” No attention, however, was paid to Galle’s\r\nobservation. On November 15, 1850, _William Cranch Bond_ (1789-1859), of\r\nthe Harvard Observatory in Massachusetts, discovered the same phenomenon\r\nunder its true form—that of a dusky ring interior to the more brilliant\r\none. A fortnight later, before the news of Bond’s observation, Dawes\r\nmade the same discovery independently at Wateringbury in England. This\r\nring is known as the dusky or “crape” ring.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the dusky ring brought to the front the problem of the\r\ncomposition of the ring-system. Laplace and Herschel considered the\r\nrings to be solid, but this was denied in 1848 by _Edouard Roche_\r\n(1820-1880), who believed them to consist of small particles, and in\r\n1851 by G. P. Bond, who asserted that the variations in the appearance\r\nof the system were sufficient to negative the idea of their solidity;\r\nbut he suggested that the rings were fluid. In 1857 the question was\r\ntaken up by the Scottish physicist, _James Clerk-Maxwell_ (1831-1879),\r\nwho proved by mathematical calculation that the rings could be neither\r\nsolid nor fluid, but were due to an aggregation of small particles, so\r\nclosely crowded together as to present the appearance of a continuous\r\nwhole. Clerk-Maxwell’s explanation—which had been suggested by the\r\nyounger Cassini in 1715, and by Thomas Wright in 1750—was at once\r\nadopted, and has since been proved by observation. In 1888 _Hugo\r\nSeeliger_ (born 1849), director of the Munich Observatory, showed from\r\nphotometric observations the correctness of the satellite-theory; while\r\nBarnard in 1889 witnessed an eclipse of the satellite Japetus by the\r\ndusky ring. The satellite did not disappear, but was seen with perfect\r\ndistinctness. The final demonstration of the meteoric nature of the\r\nrings was made by Keeler at the Alleghany Observatory in 1895, with the\r\naid of the spectroscope. By means of Doppler’s principle, he found that\r\nthe inner edge of the ring revolved in a much shorter time than the\r\nouter, proving conclusively that they could not be solid. This was\r\nconfirmed by the observations of Campbell at Mount Hamilton, _Henri\r\nDeslandres_ at Meudon, and Bélopolsky at Pulkowa.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 a startling theory regarding Saturn’s rings was put forward by\r\nthe famous _Otto Wilhelm von Struve_ (1819-1905). Comparing his\r\nmeasurements on the rings made at Pulkowa in 1850 and 1851 with those of\r\nother astronomers for the past two hundred years, he reached the\r\nconclusion that the inner diameter of the ring was decreasing at the\r\nrate of sixty miles a-year, and that the bodies composing the rings were\r\nbeing drawn closer to the planet. Accordingly, Struve calculated that\r\nonly three centuries would be required to bring about the precipitation\r\nof the ring-system on to the globe of Saturn. In 1881 and 1882 Struve,\r\nexpecting a further decrease, made another series of measures, but these\r\ndid not confirm his theory, which was accordingly abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe study of the globe of Saturn has made less progress than that of the\r\nrings. The surface of the planet had been known since before the time of\r\nHerschel to be covered with belts, but as spots seldom appear on Saturn,\r\nonly one determination of the rotation period had been made, that by\r\nHerschel. Much interest was aroused, therefore, by the discovery, by\r\nHall, at Washington, on December 7, 1876, of a bright equatorial spot.\r\nHall studied this spot during sixty rotations of the planet, determining\r\nthe period as 10 hours 14 minutes 24 seconds. This was confirmed by\r\nDenning in 1891, and by _Stanley Williams_, an English observer, in the\r\nsame year. On June 16, 1903, Barnard, at the Yerkes Observatory,\r\ndiscovered a bright spot, from which he deduced a rotation period of 10\r\nhours 39 minutes,—a period considerably longer than that found by Hall.\r\nIn the same year various spots on Saturn were observed by Denning, who\r\nfound a period of 10 hours 37 minutes 56·4 seconds, and at Barcelona by\r\n_José Comas Sola_, now director of the Observatory there, who may be\r\nconsidered Spain’s leading astronomer. The result of these observations\r\nhas been to show that the spots on Saturn have probably a proper motion\r\nof their own, apart from the rotation of the planet. As to the spectrum\r\nof Saturn, little has been learned. It closely resembles that of\r\nJupiter. In 1867 Janssen, observing from the summit of Mount Etna, found\r\ntraces of aqueous vapour in the planet’s atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn the chapters on Herschel we have seen that he discovered the sixth\r\nand seventh satellites of Saturn. The next discovery was made on\r\nSeptember 19, 1848, by W. C. Bond, at Harvard, Massachusetts, and\r\nindependently by _William Lassell_ (1799-1880), at Starfield, near\r\nLiverpool. The new satellite received the name of Hyperion, and was\r\nfound to be situated at a distance of about 946,000 miles from Saturn.\r\nIts small size led Sir John Herschel to the idea that it might be an\r\nasteroidal satellite. Fifty years elapsed before another satellite of\r\nSaturn was discovered. In 1888 W. H. Pickering commenced a photographic\r\nsearch for new satellites of the planet. At last, on developing some\r\nphotographs of Saturn, taken on August 16, 17, and 18, 1898, he found\r\ntraces of a new satellite which he named “Phœbe.” But, as the satellite\r\nwas not seen or photographed again for some years, many astronomers were\r\nsceptical as to its existence. However, photographs taken in 1900, 1901,\r\nand 1902 revealed the satellite, which was again photographed in 1904,\r\nand seen visually by Barnard in the same year with the 40-inch Yerkes\r\ntelescope. At that time the discoverer brought out the amazing fact that\r\nthe motion of the satellite is retrograde—a fact which he attempts to\r\nexplain by a new theory of the former rotation of Saturn. He likewise\r\ndemonstrated that its distance from Saturn varied from 6,120,000 to\r\n9,740,000 miles. Early in 1905 Pickering announced the discovery of a\r\ntenth satellite of Saturn, which received the name of Themis, with a\r\nperiod and mean distance nearly similar to Hyperion, so that Sir John\r\nHerschel’s idea of Hyperion being an asteroidal satellite is being\r\nconfirmed after a lapse of half a century.\r\n\r\nIf little is known of the globe of Saturn, still less is known regarding\r\nUranus. Dusky bands resembling those of Jupiter were observed by Young\r\nat Princeton in 1883. In the following year Paul and Prosper Henry\r\ndiscerned at Paris two grey parallel lines on the disc of the planet.\r\nThis was confirmed by the observations of Perrotin at Nice, which also\r\nindicated rotation in a period of ten hours. In 1890 Perrotin again took\r\nup the study and re-observed the dark bands. On the other hand, no\r\ndefinite results regarding the planet were obtained by the Lick\r\nobservers in 1889 and 1890. Measurements of the planet by Young,\r\nSchiaparelli, Perrotin, and others indicate a considerable polar\r\ncompression. The spectrum of the planet has been studied by Secchi,\r\nHuggins, Vogel, Keeler, Slipher, and others. The spectrum shows six\r\nbands of original absorption, a line of hydrogen, which, says Miss\r\nClerke, “implies accordingly the presence of free hydrogen in the\r\nUranian atmosphere, where a temperature must thus prevail sufficiently\r\nhigh to reduce water to its constituent elements.” From a photographic\r\nstudy of the spectrum at the Lowell Observatory in 1904, Slipher\r\nobserved a line corresponding to that of helium, indicating the presence\r\nof that element in the planet’s atmosphere.\r\n\r\nHerschel left our knowledge of the Uranian satellites in a very\r\nuncertain state. The two outer satellites, Titania and Oberon, were\r\nrediscovered in 1828 by his son, but the other four, which he was\r\nbelieved to have discovered, were never seen again. In 1847 two inner\r\nsatellites, Ariel and Umbriel, were discovered by Lassell and Otto\r\nStruve respectively, their existence being finally confirmed by\r\nLassell’s observations in 1851.\r\n\r\nAfter the discovery of Uranus by Herschel, mathematical astronomers\r\ndetermined its orbit and calculated its position in the future. _Alexis\r\nBouvard_, the calculating partner of Laplace, published tables of the\r\nplanet’s motions, founded on observations made by various astronomers\r\nwho had considered it a star before its discovery by Herschel; but as\r\nthe planet was not in the exact position which Bouvard predicted, he\r\nrejected the earlier observations altogether. For a few years the planet\r\nconformed to the Frenchman’s predictions, but shortly afterwards it was\r\nagain observed to move in an irregular manner, and the discrepancy\r\nbetween observation and the calculations of mathematicians became\r\nintolerable. Did the law of gravitation not hold good for the frontiers\r\nof the Solar System? Gradually astronomers arrived at the conclusion\r\nthat Uranus was being attracted off its course by the influence of an\r\nunseen body, an exterior planet. Bouvard himself was one of the first to\r\nmake the suggestion, but died before the planet was discovered. An\r\nEnglish amateur, the Rev. _T. J. Hussey_, resolved to make, in 1834, a\r\ndetermination of the place of the unseen body, but found his powers\r\ninadequate; and in 1840 Bessel laid his plans for an investigation of\r\nthe problem, but failing health prevented him carrying out his design.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 a student at the University of Cambridge resolved to grapple\r\nwith the problem. John Couch Adams, born at Lidcot in Cornwall in 1819,\r\nentered in 1839 the University of Cambridge, where he graduated in 1843.\r\nFrom 1858 Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge, and from 1861 director of\r\nthe Observatory, he died on January 21, 1892, after a life spent in\r\ndevotion to mathematical astronomy. In 1843, on taking his degree, he\r\ncommenced the investigation of the orbit of Uranus. For two years he\r\nworked at the difficult question, and by September 1845 came to the\r\nconclusion that a planet revolving at a certain distance beyond Uranus\r\nwould produce the observed irregularities. He handed to _James Challis_\r\n(1803-1882), the director of the Cambridge Observatory, a paper\r\ncontaining the elements of what was named by Adams “the new planet.” On\r\nOctober 21 of the same year he visited Greenwich Observatory, and left a\r\npaper containing the elements of the planet, and approximately fixing\r\nits position in the heavens. But the Astronomer-Royal of England, Sir\r\n_George Biddell Airy_ (1801-1892), had little faith in the calculations\r\nof the young mathematician. He always considered the correctness of a\r\ndistant mathematical result to be a subject rather of moral than of\r\nmathematical evidence: in fact, regarding Uranus, the Astronomer-Royal\r\nalmost called in question the correctness of the law of gravitation.\r\nBesides, the novelty of the investigations aroused scepticism, and the\r\nfact that Adams was a young man, and inexperienced, went against Airy’s\r\nacceptance of the theory. However, he wrote to Adams questioning him on\r\nthe soundness of his idea. Adams thought the matter trivial, and did not\r\nreply. Airy, therefore, took no interest in the investigations, and no\r\nsteps were taken to search for the unseen planet. Meanwhile the Rev. W.\r\nR. Dawes happened to see Adams’ papers lying at Greenwich, and wrote to\r\nhis friend, the well-known astronomer Lassell, who was in possession of\r\na very fine reflector, erected at his residence near Liverpool, asking\r\nhim to search for the planet. But Lassell was suffering from a sprained\r\nankle, and Dawes’ letter was accidentally destroyed by a housemaid. So\r\nAdams’ theory remained in obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe question now came under the notice of _François Jean Dominique\r\nArago_ (1786-1853), the director of the Paris Observatory. He recognised\r\nin a young friend of his a rising genius, who was competent to solve the\r\nproblem. Urban Jean Joseph Le Verrier, born at Saint Lo, in Normandy, in\r\n1811, became in 1837 astronomical teacher in the École Polytechnique,\r\nand in 1853 director of the Paris Observatory. In consequence of\r\ndifferences with his staff he was obliged, in 1870, to resign from this\r\nposition, but two years later was restored to the post, which he held\r\ntill his death on September 23, 1877.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, ignorant of the fact that Adams had already solved the problem,\r\nLe Verrier began his investigations of the irregular motions of Uranus.\r\nIn a memoir communicated to the Academy of Sciences in November of that\r\nyear, he demonstrated that no known causes could produce these\r\ndisturbances. In a second memoir, dated June 1, 1846, he announced that\r\nan exterior planet alone could produce these effects. But Le Verrier had\r\nnow before him the difficult task of assigning an approximate position\r\nto the unseen body, so that it might be telescopically discovered. After\r\nmuch calculation Le Verrier, in his third memoir (August 31, 1846),\r\nassigned to the planet a position in the constellation Aquarius.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile one of Le Verrier’s papers happened to reach Airy. Seeing its\r\nresemblance to Adams’ papers, which had been lying on his desk for\r\nmonths, his scepticism vanished, and he suggested to Challis that the\r\nplanet should be searched for with the Cambridge equatorial. In July\r\n1846 the search was commenced. The planet was actually observed on\r\nAugust 4 and 12, but, owing to the absence of star maps, it was not\r\nrecognised. “After four days of observing,” he wrote to Airy, “the\r\nplanet was in my grasp if I had only examined or mapped the\r\nobservations.”\r\n\r\nLe Verrier wrote to Encke, the illustrious director of the Berlin\r\nObservatory, desiring him to make a telescopic search for a planetary\r\nobject situated in the constellation Aquarius, as bright as a star of\r\nthe eighth magnitude and possessed of a visible disc. “Look where I tell\r\nyou,” wrote the French astronomer, “and you will see an object such as I\r\ndescribe.” Encke ordered his two assistants, Galle and D’Arrest, to make\r\na search on the night of September 23, 1846. In a few hours Galle\r\nobserved an object not marked in the star-maps of the Berlin\r\nObservatory, which had been recently published. The following night\r\nsufficed to show that the object was in motion, and was therefore a new\r\nplanet. On September 29 Challis found the planet at Cambridge, but he\r\nwas too late, as the priority of the discovery was now lost to Adams.\r\nThe planet received the name of “Neptune.”\r\n\r\nFor some time, indeed, it appeared as if the French astronomer alone was\r\nto receive the honour of the discovery. But on October 3, 1846, a letter\r\nfrom Sir John Herschel appeared in the ‘Athenæum’ in which he referred\r\nto the discovery made by Adams. The French scientists were extremely\r\njealous. Indeed, Arago actually declared that, when Neptune was under\r\ndiscussion, the entire honour should go to Le Verrier, and the name of\r\nAdams should not even be mentioned,—Arago’s line of reasoning being that\r\nit was not the man who first made a discovery who should receive the\r\ncredit, but he who first made it public. However, the credit of the\r\ndiscovery is now given equally to Adams and Le Verrier, both of whom are\r\nregarded as among the greatest of astronomers.\r\n\r\nOnly a fortnight after the discovery of Neptune, the astronomer Lassell\r\nobserved a satellite to the distant planet on October 10, 1846. This\r\ndiscovery was confirmed in July 1847 by the discoverer himself, and\r\nshortly afterwards by Bond and Otto Struve. Regarding the globe of\r\nNeptune, we know practically nothing. No markings of any kind have been\r\nobserved on its surface. However, in 1883 and 1884, _Maxwell Hall_, an\r\nastronomer in Jamaica, noticed certain variations of brilliance which\r\nsuggested a rotation-period of eight hours, but this was not confirmed\r\nby any other astronomer. The spectrum of Neptune has been investigated\r\nby various observers, who have found it to be similar to that of Uranus.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a trans-Neptunian planet has been suspected by many\r\nastronomers. In November 1879 the first idea of its existence was thrown\r\nout by Flammarion in his ‘Popular Astronomy.’ Flammarion noticed that\r\nall the periodical comets in the Solar System have their aphelion near\r\nthe orbit of a planet. Thus Jupiter owns about eighteen comets; Saturn\r\nowns one, and probably two; Uranus two or three; and Neptune six. The\r\nthird comet of 1862, however, along with the August meteors, goes\r\nfarther out than the orbit of Neptune. Accordingly, Flammarion suggested\r\nthe existence of a great planet, assigning it a period of 330 years and\r\na distance of 4000 millions of miles.\r\n\r\nTwo independent investigators, _David Peck Todd_ (born 1855) in America\r\nand _George Forbes_ in Scotland, have since undertaken to find the\r\nplanet. Todd, utilising the “residual perturbations” of Uranus, assigned\r\na period of 375 years for his planet. Forbes, on the other hand, working\r\nfrom the comet theory, stated his belief in the existence of two planets\r\nwith periods of 1000 and 5000 years respectively. In October 1901 he\r\ncomputed the position of the new planet on the celestial sphere, fixing\r\nits position in the constellation Libra, and computing its size to be\r\ngreater than Jupiter. A search was made by means of photography, in\r\n1902, but without success. Nevertheless, astronomers are pretty\r\nconfident of the existence of one or more trans-Neptunian planets.\r\nLowell is very definite on this subject when he says in regard to meteor\r\ngroups, “The Perseids and the Lyrids go out to meet the unknown planet,\r\nwhich circles at a distance of about forty-five astronomical units from\r\nthe Sun. It may seem strange to speak thus confidently of what no mortal\r\neye has seen, but the finger of the sign-board of phenomena points so\r\nclearly as to justify the definite article. The eye of analysis has\r\nalready suspected the invisible.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n                                COMETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of Herschel the ancient superstitions in regard to comets\r\nhad to a great extent vanished, thanks mainly to the return of Halley’s\r\ncomet in 1758. Yet, although comets had ceased to be objects of terror,\r\nno explanation or rational theory of their nature was put forward until\r\nthe appearance of the great comet of 1811. This comet was visible from\r\nMarch 26, 1811, to August 17, 1812, a period of 510 days. It was one of\r\nthe most magnificent comets ever seen, its tail being 100 millions of\r\nmiles in length and its head 127,000 miles in diameter. This wonderful\r\nphenomenon was the subject of much investigation, particularly by\r\nOlbers, the great German astronomer.\r\n\r\nHeinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers was born at Arbergen, a village near\r\nBremen, October 11, 1758. His father was a clergyman who, in addition to\r\nconsiderable mathematical powers, was an enthusiastic lover of\r\nastronomy. At the age of thirteen young Olbers became deeply interested\r\nin that science. While taking an evening walk in the month of August, he\r\nobserved the Pleiades, and determined to find out to which constellation\r\nthey belonged. He therefore bought some books on astronomy, along with a\r\nfew charts of the sky, and he began to study the science with much\r\nenthusiasm. He read every book he could lay his hands on, and a few\r\nmonths sufficed to make him acquainted with all the constellations.\r\n\r\nIn 1777, when in his nineteenth year, Olbers entered the University of\r\nGöttingen to study medicine, and at the same time he learned much\r\nregarding mathematics and astronomy from the mathematician Kaestner.\r\nWhen twenty-one years of age he observed the stars at Göttingen, and\r\ndevised a method of calculating the orbits of comets, the idea coming to\r\nhim while he was attending at the bedside of a fellow-student who had\r\ntaken ill. “Although not made public until 1797,” writes Miss Clerke,\r\n“‘Olbers’ method’ was then universally adopted, and is still regarded as\r\nthe most expeditious and convenient in cases where absolute rigour is\r\nnot required. By its introduction, not only many a toilsome and\r\nthankless hour was spared, but workers were multiplied and encouraged in\r\nthe pursuit of labours more useful than attractive.”\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1781 he returned to Bremen, settled as a medical\r\ndoctor, and continued in practice for about forty-one years. But\r\nalthough he had adopted perhaps the most toilsome profession, his love\r\nof science prevailed, and night after night he explored the heavens with\r\nuntiring zeal. He never slept more than four hours, and the upper part\r\nof his house in the Sandgasse, in Bremen, was fitted up with\r\nastronomical instruments. The largest telescope which he possessed was a\r\nrefractor 3¾ inches in aperture. He remained in active practice till\r\n1823, when he retired, and was enabled to devote more attention to his\r\nbeloved science. He died on March 2, 1840, at the advanced age of\r\neighty-one.\r\n\r\nMiss Clerke says of Olbers, “Night after night, during half a century\r\nand upwards, he discovered, calculated, or observed the cometary\r\nvisitants of northern skies.” He was the discoverer of the comet of\r\n1815, known as Olbers’ comet. It moves round the Sun in a period of over\r\nseventy years, and returned to perihelion in 1887, forty-seven years\r\nafter the death of its discoverer. The great comet of 1811 was the\r\nsubject of a memoir which Olbers published the following year, and in\r\nwhich he originated the “electrical repulsion” theory of comets’ tails.\r\nEven after the fulfilment of Halley’s great prediction, comets were\r\nstill looked upon with profound awe, and the popular fear regarding them\r\nwas still prevalent. Olbers, however, showed that the tails of comets\r\nresulted from purely natural causes. He regarded the Sun as possessed of\r\na repulsive as well as an attractive force, and considered the tails to\r\nbe vapours repelled from the nucleus of the comet by the Sun. He\r\ncalculated that in the comet of 1811 the particles of matter expelled\r\nfrom the head reached the tail in eleven minutes, with a velocity\r\ncomparable to that of light. The theory of electrical repulsion, since\r\nelaborated by other observers, is now generally accepted among\r\nastronomers. No other hypothesis represents in such a complete manner\r\nthe formation and growth of the luminous appendages of the celestial\r\nbodies so picturesquely called “pale-winged messengers” as that put\r\nforward by the physician of Bremen.\r\n\r\nSome years after Olbers’ famous theory was given to the world, a great\r\nadvance was made in cometary astronomy by another great German\r\nastronomer, his friend and pupil Encke. The son of a Hamburg clergyman,\r\nJohann Franz Encke was born in that city in 1791, and died in 1865 at\r\nSpandau. After taking part in the war against Napoleon, he was in 1822\r\nappointed director of the Gotha Observatory, being called to Berlin in\r\n1825. In early life he was the pupil of Olbers and Gauss, and his\r\ninvestigations and discoveries formed an epoch in astronomy. His most\r\nfamous discovery related to the little comet which bears his name. The\r\ncomet was discovered by _J. L. Pons_ (1761-1831) at Marseilles, although\r\nit had previously been seen by Méchain and Caroline Herschel. In 1819\r\nEncke computed the orbit of the comet, and boldly announced that it\r\nwould reappear in 1822, its period being about 3¼ years, or 1208 days.\r\nIn 1822 the comet, true to Encke’s prediction, returned to perihelion,\r\nand was observed at Paramatta in Australia, the perihelion passage\r\ntaking place within three hours of the time predicted by Encke. As Miss\r\nClerke remarks, “The importance of this event will be better understood\r\nwhen it is remembered that it was only the second instance of the\r\nrecognised return of a comet; and that it, moreover, established the\r\nexistence of a new class of celestial bodies, distinguished as comets of\r\nshort period.”\r\n\r\nIn 1825 the comet was again observed by Valz, passing perihelion on\r\nSeptember 16, and in 1828 it was seen by Struve. Encke now made a very\r\nremarkable discovery. Determining its period with great accuracy, in\r\n1832 he found that his comet returned to perihelion two and a half hours\r\nbefore the predicted time. As this repeatedly happened, Encke put\r\nforward the theory that the acceleration was due to the existence of a\r\nresisting medium in the neighbourhood of the Sun, too rarefied to retard\r\nthe planetary motions, but quite dense enough to make the comet’s path\r\nsmaller, and to eventually precipitate it on the Sun. The theory was\r\nwidely accepted, but after 1868 the acceleration began to decrease,\r\ndiminishing by one-half; besides, no other comet is thus accelerated,\r\nand the hypothesis has accordingly been abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe second comet recognised as periodic was that discovered on February\r\n27, 1826, by an Austrian officer, _Wilhelm von Biela_ (1782-1856), and\r\nten days later by the French observer, _Gambart_ (1800-1836), both of\r\nwhom, in computing its orbit, noticed a remarkable similarity to the\r\norbits of comets which appeared in 1772 and 1805. Accordingly, they\r\nconcluded it to be periodic, with a period of between six and seven\r\nyears. The comet returned in 1832. In 1828 Olbers had published certain\r\ncalculations showing that portions of the comet would sweep over the\r\npart of the Earth’s orbit a month later than the Earth itself. This gave\r\nrise to a panic that the comet would destroy the Earth, which did not\r\nsubside till it was announced by Arago that the Earth and the comet\r\nwould at no time approach to within fifty million miles of each other.\r\nThe comet returned again in the end of 1845. It was kept well in view by\r\nastronomers in Europe and America. On December 19, 1846, Hind noticed\r\nthat the comet was pear-shaped, and ten days later it had divided in\r\ntwo. The two comets returned again in 1852 and were well observed; but\r\nthey were never seen again, at least as comets. Their subsequent history\r\nbelongs to meteoric astronomy.\r\n\r\nA comet discovered by Faye at Paris in 1843 was found to have a period\r\nof seven and a half years. It has returned regularly since its\r\ndiscovery, true to astronomical prediction. Its motion was particularly\r\ninvestigated for traces of a resisting medium, by _Didrik Magnus Axel\r\nMöller_ (1830-1896), director of the Lund Observatory, who reached a\r\nnegative conclusion.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 Halley’s comet returned to perihelion, and was attentively\r\nstudied by the most famous astronomers of the age. It was particularly\r\nstudied by Sir John Herschel and by Bessel, who assisted in developing\r\nOlbers’ theory of electrical repulsion. But the most brilliant comet of\r\nthe century was that which suddenly appeared on February 28, 1843, in\r\nthe vicinity of the Sun. This great comet, whose centre approached the\r\nSun within 78,000 miles, rushed past its perihelion at the speed of 366\r\nmiles a second. The comet’s tail reached the length of 200 millions of\r\nmiles. The comet of 1843 was however outshone, not in brilliance but as\r\na celestial spectacle, by the great comet discovered on June 2, 1858, by\r\n_Giovanni Battista Donati_ (1826-1873) at Florence, and since known by\r\nhis name. It became visible to the naked eye on August 19, and was\r\ntelescopically observed until March 4, 1859. There was abundance of\r\ntime, therefore, to study the comet, which was exhaustively observed by\r\nG. P. Bond at Harvard. His observations convinced him that the light\r\nfrom Donati’s comet was merely reflected sunshine, and this was\r\ngenerally accepted. Another great comet appeared in 1861. Like that of\r\n1843, its appearance was sudden, being observed after sunset on June 30,\r\n1861, when, says Miss Clerke, “a golden yellow planetary disc, wrapt in\r\ndense nebulosity, shone out while the June twilight in these latitudes\r\nwas still in its first strength.” On the same evening the Earth and the\r\nMoon passed through the tail of the great comet. The vast majority of\r\npeople never knew that such a phenomenon had taken place, and even the\r\nastronomers only noticed a singular phosphorescence in the sky—a proof\r\nof the extreme tenuity of comets.\r\n\r\nThe first application of the spectroscope to the light of comets was\r\nmade by Donati in 1864. The spectrum was found to consist of three\r\nbright bands, but Donati was unable to identify them. However, his\r\nobservation gave the death-blow to the theory that comets shone by\r\nreflected light alone, for it implied the existence of glowing gas in\r\nthem. On the appearance in 1868 of the periodic comet discovered by\r\n_Friedrich August Theodor Winnecke_ (1835-1897), the spectrum was\r\nexamined by Huggins, who identified the bright bands with the spectrum\r\nof hydrocarbon. This was confirmed in regard to Coggia’s comet of 1874\r\nby Huggins himself, and also Brédikhine and Vogel. The hydrocarbon\r\nspectrum is characteristic of comets, and has been recognised in all\r\nthose spectroscopically studied.\r\n\r\nThe time had now come for a more complete theory of comets than that of\r\nOlbers. The theory of electrical repulsion was developed in 1871 by\r\nZöllner, whose principle of investigation is thus described by Miss\r\nClerke: “The efficacy of solar electrical repulsion relatively to solar\r\nattraction grows as the size of the particle diminishes.” If the\r\nparticle is small enough, it will obey the repulsive, and not the\r\nattractive, power of the Sun. Zöllner considered that the smallest\r\nparticles of comets obeyed the repulsive power, and thus formed the\r\ntails of comets. The development of a complete cometary theory is due,\r\nhowever, to the genius of a Russian astronomer. Theodor Alexandrovitch\r\nBrédikhine, born in 1831 at Nicolaieff, was employed at Moscow\r\nObservatory from 1857 to 1890, when he was promoted to the position of\r\ndirector at Pulkowa. He resigned in 1895, and spent his last years in St\r\nPetersburg, where he died on May 14, 1904. From the beginning of his\r\nastronomical career he was devoted to the study of comets and their\r\ntails, but it was the appearance of Coggia’s comet in 1874 which marked\r\nthe commencement of his most important observations. In that year, on\r\nmaking certain calculations regarding the hypothetical repulsive force\r\nexerted by the Sun on various comets, he reached the conclusion that the\r\nvalues representing the intensity of the repulsion fell into three\r\nclasses. This was the first hint of a classification of cometary tails.\r\nMeanwhile he carefully studied the tails of comets both from direct\r\nobservation and from drawings.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 he wrote: “I suspect that comets are divisible into groups, for\r\neach of which the repulsive force is perhaps the same.” Subsequent\r\ninvestigations led Brédikhine to divide the tails of comets into three\r\ntypes. The first type consists of long, straight tails, pointed directly\r\naway from the Sun, represented by the tails of the great comets of 1811,\r\n1843, and 1861. In the second type, represented by Donati’s and Coggia’s\r\ncomets, the tails, although pointed away from the Sun, appear\r\nconsiderably curved. In the third type the tails are, to quote Miss\r\nClerke, “short, strongly-bent, brushlike emanations, and in bright\r\ncomets seem to be only found in combination with tails of the higher\r\nclasses.”\r\n\r\nIn 1879 Brédikhine fully developed his cometary theory. Assuming the\r\nreality of the repulsive force, he concluded that to produce tails of\r\nthe first type, the repulsion requires to be twelve times greater than\r\nthe solar attraction; the production of tails of the second type\r\nnecessitates a repulsive force about equal to gravity; while the force\r\nproducing third-type tails has only one-fourth the power of gravitation.\r\nIt was concluded that the tails are formed by particles of matter\r\nrepelled from the comet by the repulsive force of the Sun, and in tails\r\nof the first type the velocity with which these particles leave the body\r\nof the comet is four or five miles a second. Brédikhine reached the\r\nconclusion that the Sun’s repulsive force is invariable, and that the\r\ndifferent types of tails are formed by the same force acting on\r\ndifferent elements. The numbers 12, 1, and ¼, are inversely proportional\r\nto the atomic weights of hydrogen, hydrocarbon gas, and iron vapour.\r\nHere, then, was the key to the mystery. Brédikhine pointed out that in\r\nall probability the first-type tails are formed of hydrogen, the second\r\nof hydrocarbon, and the third of iron, with a mixture of sodium and\r\nother elements.\r\n\r\nWithin a few years of the publication of Brédikhine’s theory, five\r\nbright comets made their appearance, and there was abundant chance of\r\ntesting the theory spectroscopically. In 1882 Well’s comet was\r\nparticularly studied at Greenwich by Maunder, who discerned a\r\nsodium-line in its spectrum. The magnificent comet which appeared in\r\n1882 was spectroscopically studied at Dunecht in Aberdeenshire by _Ralph\r\nCopeland_ (1837-1905), Astronomer-Royal of Scotland, who identified in\r\nits spectrum the prominent iron-lines as well as the sodium-line. These\r\nobservations were certainly confirmatory of Brédikhine’s theory. It\r\nshould also be stated, however, that several comets have shown, in\r\naddition to the hydrocarbon spectrum, that of reflected sunlight, which\r\nproves that the light we receive from comets is of a compound nature.\r\n\r\nThe comet which appeared in 1880 was announced by _Benjamin Apthorp\r\nGould_ (1824-1896) to be a return of the great comet of 1843.\r\nCalculations by Gould, Copeland, and Hind revealed a close similarity\r\nbetween the elements of the two orbits. Eventually it had to be admitted\r\nthat the comets were separate bodies travelling in the same orbit. Then,\r\ntwo years later, the great September comet of 1882 was found to revolve\r\nin the same orbit as those of 1668, 1843, and 1880. Four years later,\r\nanother comet, discovered in 1887, was found to move in the same path.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to this subject is the existence of “comet families,”\r\ndemonstrated by Hoek of Utrecht in 1865, and mentioned in our chapter on\r\nthe Outer Planets. These comets are found to be dependent on the\r\nplanets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, each possessing a\r\ncomet-group. Various theories have been advanced to account for the\r\nexistence of these groups. One of these theories is that the comets have\r\nbeen captured by the various planets, who have forced them into their\r\npresent orbits. A mathematical study by _Jean Pierre Octave Callandrean_\r\n(1852-1904) shows that the large number of comets possessed by the\r\nvarious planets may be explained by the disintegration of large comets\r\ninto small ones. The capture theory, it must be remembered, is purely\r\nhypothetical, and must not be regarded as anything but a theory. All\r\nthat we really know is the existence of comet-families, and of comets\r\nmoving in the same orbits.\r\n\r\nThe first photograph of a comet was that of Donati’s, taken in 1858 by\r\nBond. In 1881 Tebbutt’s comet was photographed in England by Huggins,\r\nand in America by _Henry Draper_ (1837-1882), while in 1882 Gill secured\r\nexcellent photographs of the great September comet. The first\r\nphotographic discovery of a comet was made by Barnard in 1892. Since\r\nthen photography has been much used in cometary astronomy. No bright\r\ncomets have appeared since 1882,—if we except the comet of 1901, only\r\nseen in the southern hemisphere,—although several have been just visible\r\nto the naked eye, among them Swift’s comet of 1892 and Perrine’s in the\r\nautumn of 1902. Telescopic comets, however, are very numerous, and a\r\nyear never passes without one or more being discovered. The ordinary\r\nperiodic comets, such as Encke’s, Faye’s, and others, are very faint,\r\nand are becoming fainter at each return—a clear proof that comets die,\r\nas Kepler said three centuries ago. This brings us to the subject of the\r\nnext chapter, Meteoric Astronomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n                                METEORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no more interesting chapter in the history of astronomy than\r\nthat relating to meteors. A hundred years ago shooting-stars were not\r\nconsidered to be astronomical phenomena. They were supposed to be merely\r\ninflammable vapours which caught fire in the upper regions of our\r\natmosphere, although both Halley and the scientist _Ernst Chladni_\r\n(1756-1827) had notions of their celestial origin. For thirty-three\r\nyears after the beginning of the century, however, nothing was heard of\r\nmeteoric astronomy, nor was the subject considered as part of the\r\nastronomer’s labours.\r\n\r\nA great meteoric shower took place on the night of November 12 and\r\nmorning of November 13, 1833. The shower was probably the grandest ever\r\nwitnessed, the shooting-stars being literally innumerable. The display\r\nwas best observed in America, and was attentively watched by _Denison\r\nOlmsted_ (1791-1859), Professor of Mathematics at Yale, and by the\r\nAmerican physicist, _A. C. Twining_ (1801-1884). These investigators\r\ndiscovered that all the meteors which fell during the great shower\r\nseemed to come from the same part of the celestial vault. In other\r\nwords, their paths, when traced back, were found to converge to a point\r\nnear the star γ Leonis. This observation gave the death-blow to the\r\ntheory of their terrestrial origin. The point known as the “radiant” was\r\nclearly a point independent of the Earth. Olmsted also recognised the\r\nfact that the shower had taken place in the previous year, and he\r\nregarded it as produced by a swarm of particles moving round the Sun in\r\na period of 182 days. Soon after this it was noticed that the phenomenon\r\ntook place in 1834 and subsequent years with gradually decreasing\r\nintensity. It was then remembered that Humboldt had observed in November\r\n1799 a very brilliant shower, and accordingly Olbers suggested that\r\nanother shower might be seen in 1867.\r\n\r\nThe falling stars of August were next proved by _Adolphe Quetelet_\r\n(1791-1874) to form another meteoric system; and accordingly the theory\r\nof Olmsted that the November meteors moved round the Sun in 182 days had\r\nto be abandoned, for, says Miss Clerke, “If it would be a violation of\r\nprobability to attribute to _one_ such agglomeration a period of an\r\nexact year or sub-multiple of a year, it would be plainly absurd to\r\nsuppose the movements of _two_ or more regulated by such highly\r\nartificial conditions.” Accordingly Erman suggested in 1839 the theory\r\nthat meteors revolved in closed rings, intersecting the terrestrial\r\norbit; and that when the Earth crossed through the point of\r\nintersection, it met some members of the swarm. The subject now remained\r\nin abeyance for thirty-four years, if we except some wonderful ideas put\r\nforward in 1861 by _Daniel Kirkwood_ (1813-1896), an American\r\nastronomer, who stated his belief in the disintegration of comets into\r\nmeteors; but little attention was paid to his opinions. In 1864 the\r\nsubject was taken up by _Hubert Anson Newton_ (1830-1896), Professor at\r\nYale, who undertook a search through ancient records for the\r\nthirty-three-year period of the Leonids or November meteors. His search\r\nwas highly successful, and having demonstrated the existence of the\r\nperiod, Newton set himself to determine the orbit. He indicated five\r\npossible orbits for the swarm, ranging from 33 years to 354½ days.\r\nNewton was unable to solve the question mathematically; but here Adams,\r\nthe discoverer of Neptune, came to the rescue, and demonstrated that the\r\nperiod of 33¼ years was alone possible, and that the others were\r\nuntenable. These investigations, completed in March 1867, proved the\r\nexistence of a great meteoric orbit extending to the orbit of Uranus.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Newton had predicted a meteoric shower on the evening of\r\nNovember 13 and morning of November 14, 1866. His prediction was\r\nfulfilled. The shower was inferior to that of 1833, but was still a\r\nmagnificent spectacle. Sir Robert Ball, then employed at Lord Rosse’s\r\nObservatory, observed the shower, and records the impossibility of\r\ncounting the meteors. This great shower attracted the attention of\r\nastronomers all over the world to the study of meteors. Meanwhile\r\nSchiaparelli had been working at the subject for some time, and in four\r\nletters addressed to Secchi, towards the end of 1866, he showed that\r\nmeteors were members of the Solar System, possessed of a greater\r\nvelocity than that of the Earth, and travelling in orbits resembling\r\nthose of comets, in the fact that they moved in no particular plane, and\r\nthat their motion was both direct and retrograde. Schiaparelli computed\r\nthe orbit of the Perseids or August meteors, and was astonished to find\r\nit identical with the comet of August 1862. This was a proof of the\r\nconnection between these two apparently widely different types of\r\ncelestial bodies. Early in 1867 Schiaparelli found that Le Verrier’s\r\nelements for the orbit of the Leonids were identical with those of the\r\ncomet of 1866, discovered by _Ernst Tempel_ (1821-1889). Peters of\r\nAltona had meanwhile reached the same conclusion; while _Edmund Weiss_\r\n(born 1837) of Vienna pointed out the similarity of the orbit of a\r\nstar-shower on April 20 and that of the comet of 1861. He also drew\r\nattention, independently of Galle and D’Arrest, to the close connection\r\nbetween the orbits of the lost Biela’s comet and the Andromedid meteors\r\nof November.\r\n\r\nAll doubt as to the connection of comets and meteors was removed by the\r\ngreat shower on November 27, 1872. Biela’s lost comet was due at\r\nperihelion in 1872, and although searched for was not observed; but when\r\nthe Earth crossed its orbit, a great meteoric shower took place. “It\r\nbecame evident,” says Miss Clerke, “that Biela’s comet was shedding over\r\nus the pulverised products of its disintegration.” The shower was little\r\ninferior to that of 1866. Meanwhile _Ernst Klinkerfues_ (1827-1884),\r\nProfessor at Göttingen, believing that Biela’s comet itself had\r\nencountered the Earth, telegraphed to _Norman Robert Pogson_\r\n(1829-1891), Government astronomer at Madras, to search for the comet in\r\nthe opposite region of the sky. Pogson did observe a comet, but\r\ncertainly not Biela’s, although probably another fragment of the missing\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the actual disintegration of comets was enunciated by\r\nSchiaparelli in 1873, and developed in his work ‘Le Stelle Cadenti.’ He\r\nwas led to regard comets as cosmical clouds formed in space by “the\r\nlocal concentration of celestial matter.” He then remarks that a\r\ncosmical cloud seldom penetrates to the interior of the Solar System,\r\n“unless it has been transformed into a parabolic current,” which may\r\noccupy years, or centuries, in passing its perihelion, “forming in space\r\na river, whose transverse dimensions are very small with respect to its\r\nlength: of such currents, those which are encountered by the earth in\r\nits annual motion are rendered visible to us under the form of showers\r\nof meteors diverging from a certain radiant.”\r\n\r\nSchiaparelli next pointed out that when the current of meteors\r\nencounters a planet, the resulting perturbations cause some of the\r\nmeteoric bodies to move in separate orbits, forming the bolides and\r\naerolites which fall from the sky at intervals. “The term _falling\r\nstars_” he says, “expresses simply and precisely the truth respecting\r\nthem. These bodies have the same relation to comets that the small\r\nplanets between Mars and Jupiter have to the larger planets.” In the\r\nthird chapter of his ‘Le Stelle Cadenti’ he explicitly states that “the\r\nmeteoric currents are the products of the dissolution of comets, and\r\nconsist of minute particles which certain comets have abandoned along\r\ntheir orbits, by reason of the disintegrating force which the Sun and\r\nplanets exert on the rare materials of which they are composed.”\r\n\r\nIn 1878 _Alexander Stewart Herschel_ (born 1836), son of Sir John\r\nHerschel, and a famous meteoric observer, published a list of known or\r\nsuspected coincidences of meteoric and cometary orbits, amounting to\r\nseventy-six. Meanwhile much progress has since been made in the\r\nobservation of meteoric showers and the determination of their radiant\r\npoints. In this branch of astronomy, by far the greatest name is that of\r\nWilliam Frederick Denning, the self-made English astronomer. Born at\r\nRedpost, in Somerset, in 1848, his career of meteoric observation\r\ncommenced in 1866. For the past forty years he has attentively devoted\r\nhimself to the observation of meteors. From 1872 to 1903 he determined\r\nthe radiant points of no fewer than 1179 meteoric showers. In addition\r\nto this, he published, in 1899, a catalogue of meteoric radiants,\r\ncontaining 4367; and he has carefully studied the remarkable objects\r\nknown as fireballs or “sporadic meteors.” He has occasionally been able\r\nto trace a connection between fireballs and weak meteoric showers, but\r\nhe concludes that they “must either be merely single sporadic bodies, or\r\nelse the survivors of some meteor group, nearly exhausted by the waste\r\nof its material during many past ages.” All of Denning’s meteoric work\r\nhas been done in his spare time, for it must be borne in mind that he\r\npursues the profession of accountant in Bristol, and that only his\r\nleisure hours have been devoted to the science of astronomy. His\r\nresearches have been entirely conducted with the unaided eye. His only\r\ninstrument is a perfectly straight wand, which he uses as a help and\r\ncorrective to the eye in ascribing the paths of the meteors. Thanks to\r\nthe laborious work of this able English astronomer, the observation of\r\nmeteors is now a _scientific_ branch of astronomy. In the words of\r\nMaunder, “for six thousand years men stared at meteors and learned\r\nnothing, for sixty years they have studied them and learned much, and\r\nhalf of what we know has been taught us in half that time by the efforts\r\nof a single observer.”\r\n\r\nFurther meteoric showers from Biela’s comet were seen in 1885 and 1892.\r\nThe Leonid shower was confidently predicted for 1899, in accordance with\r\nthe thirty-three-year period, but the great display did not come off,\r\neither in 1899 or 1900. In 1901 there was a certain weak shower observed\r\nin America; and similar displays took place in 1903 and 1904. Many\r\nexplanations have been given as to the failure of the shower, the most\r\nprobable idea being that the attraction of Jupiter diverted the meteors\r\nfrom their course.\r\n\r\nDenning’s observations on meteors resulted, as early as 1877, in the\r\ndiscovery of so-called “stationary radiants.” The radiant-point of a\r\nlong enduring shower usually exhibits an apparent motion, resulting from\r\nthe combined orbital motions of the Earth and the meteors; but Denning\r\nfound that in some cases the shower, though lasting for months,\r\npersistently exhibited the same radiant-point, implying that the motion\r\nof the Earth must be insignificant compared with that of the meteors,\r\ncomputed by Ranyard at 880 miles per second. The difficulty of admitting\r\nso great a velocity led the French astronomer, _François Felix\r\nTisserand_ (1845-1896), to doubt the existence of these stationary\r\nradiants; but the fact of their existence cannot be doubted, although no\r\nreally satisfactory explanation has been offered.\r\n\r\nAnother type of meteors comprises the bodies termed respectively as\r\nbolides, uranoliths, and aerolites,—stones which fall to the Earth from\r\nthe sky. In 1800 the French Academy declared the accounts of stones\r\nhaving fallen from the heavens to be absolutely untrue. Three years\r\nlater an aerolite fell at Laigle, in the Department of Orne, on April\r\n26, 1803, attended by a terrific explosion. In the words of Flammarion,\r\n“Numerous witnesses affirmed that some minutes after the appearance of a\r\ngreat bolide, moving from south-east to north-east, and which had been\r\nperceived at Alençon, Caen, and Falaise, a fearful explosion, followed\r\nby detonations like the report of cannon and the fire of musketry,\r\nproceeded from an isolated black cloud in a very clear sky. A great\r\nnumber of meteoric stones were then precipitated on the surface of the\r\nground, where they were collected, still smoking, over an extent of\r\ncountry which measured no less than seven miles in length.”\r\n\r\nSome aerolites, instead of being shattered into fragments, have been\r\nobserved to fall to the Earth intact, and bury themselves in the ground.\r\nNumerous instances have been observed during the last century, and\r\nmasses of meteoric stones have been found in positions which clearly\r\nindicate that they must have fallen from the sky. Chemists have made\r\nanalyses of the elements in these remarkable bodies, and have found them\r\nto contain iron, magnesium, silicon, oxygen, nickel, cobalt, tin,\r\ncopper, &c. The spectrum of these aerolites, raised to incandescence,\r\nhas been studied by Vogel and by the Swedish observer, _Bernhardt\r\nHasselberg_ (born 1848), who detected the presence of hydrocarbons,\r\nwhich are also present in cometary spectra.\r\n\r\nWhen the existence of aerolites as celestial bodies was first\r\nrecognised, Laplace suggested that they had been ejected from volcanoes\r\non the Moon. This theory, although supported by Olbers and other\r\nastronomers, was soon rejected. Next, it was suggested that they were\r\nejected from the Sun, and Proctor believed them to come from the giant\r\nplanets. A very detailed discussion of the subject is to be found in\r\nBall’s ‘Story of the Heavens’ (1886), in which he expresses views in\r\nharmony with those of the Austrian physicist Tschermak. Ball\r\ndemonstrated that the meteors which fall to the Earth cannot have come\r\nfrom any other planet, nor from the Sun. Accordingly, he concluded that\r\nthey were originally ejected by the volcanoes of the Earth many ages\r\nago, when they were active enough to throw up pieces of matter with a\r\nvelocity great enough to carry them away from the Earth altogether. Such\r\nmeteors would, however, intersect the terrestrial orbit at each\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nThe alternative theory to this, supported by Schiaparelli and Lockyer,\r\nis that the aerolites are merely larger members of the meteor-swarms,\r\nwhich have been deflected from their paths. The chief objection to this\r\ntheory is the absence of connection between the meteoric showers and the\r\nfalls of aerolites and bolides. Only on one occasion was a meteoric\r\nstone observed to fall during a shower. On November 27, 1885, during the\r\nshower of Andromedid meteors from Biela’s comet, a large bolide,\r\nweighing more than eight pounds, fell at Mazapil, in Mexico. This,\r\nhowever, was the only case hitherto observed; and it may have been\r\nmerely a coincidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n                               THE STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable progress in astronomy during the past century has\r\nbeen in the department of sidereal science, or the study of the Suns of\r\nspace, observed for their own sakes, and not merely for the purpose of\r\ndetermining the positions of the Sun and Moon, and to assist navigation.\r\nThanks to Herschel, the nineteenth century witnessed the steady\r\ndevelopment of stellar astronomy, combined with many important\r\ndiscoveries and investigations.\r\n\r\nThe one pre-Herschelian problem in sidereal astronomy was the distance\r\nof the stars. Owing to its bearing on the Copernican theory, the problem\r\nwas attacked by the astronomers of the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies. Herschel made numerous attempts to detect the parallax of the\r\nbrighter stars, but failed. Meanwhile there had been many illusions.\r\nPiazzi believed that his instruments—which in reality were worn out and\r\nunfit for use—had revealed parallaxes in Sirius, Aldebaran, Procyon, and\r\nVega; Calandrelli, another Italian, and _John Brinkley_ (1763-1835),\r\nAstronomer-Royal of Ireland, were similarly deluded; and in 1821 it was\r\nshown by _Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve_ (1793-1864), the great German\r\nastronomer, that no instruments then in use could possibly be successful\r\nin measuring the stellar parallax. A few years later, however,\r\nFraunhofer brought the refractor to a degree of perfection surpassing\r\nall previous efforts. In 1829 he mounted for the observatory at\r\nKönigsberg a heliometer, the object-glass of which was divided in two,\r\nand capable of very accurate measurements. This heliometer eventually\r\nrevealed the parallax of the stars in the able hands of Friedrich\r\nWilhelm Bessel.\r\n\r\nFriedrich Wilhelm Bessel was born at Minden, on the Weser, south-west of\r\nHanover, on July 22, 1784. His father was an obscure Government\r\nofficial, unable to provide a university education for his son. Bessel’s\r\nlove of figures, together with an aversion to Latin, led him to pursue a\r\ncommercial career. At the age of fourteen, therefore, he entered as an\r\napprenticed clerk the business of Kuhlenkamp & Sons, in Bremen. He was\r\nnot content, however, to remain in that humble position. His great\r\nambition was to become supercargo on one of the trading expeditions sent\r\nto China; and so he learned English, Spanish, and geography. But he\r\nnever became a supercargo. In order to be fully equipped for such a\r\nposition, he determined to learn how to take observations at sea, and\r\nhis acquaintance with observation aroused a desire to study astronomy.\r\nHe constructed for himself a sextant, and by means of this, along with a\r\ncommon clock, he determined the longitude of Bremen.\r\n\r\nSuch enthusiasm could not be long without its reward. For several years\r\nBessel remained a clerk, and the hours devoted to study were those\r\nspared from sleep. He studied the works of Bode, Von Zach, Lalande, and\r\nLaplace, and in two years was able to compute the orbits of comets by\r\nmeans of mathematics. From some observations of Halley’s comet at its\r\nappearance in 1607, Bessel calculated its orbit, and forwarded the\r\ncalculation to Olbers, then the greatest authority on cometary\r\nastronomy. Olbers was delighted at this work, and he sent the results to\r\nVon Zach, who published them. The self-taught young astronomer had\r\naccomplished a piece of work which fifteen years before had taxed the\r\nskill and patience of the French Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\nIn 1805, Harding, Schröter’s assistant at Lilienthal, resigned his\r\nposition for a more promising one at Göttingen. Olbers procured for\r\nBessel the offer of the vacant post, which the latter accepted. At\r\nLilienthal Bessel received his training as a practical astronomer. He\r\nremained in Schröter’s observatory until 1809. Although only twenty-five\r\nyears of age, he had become so well known in Germany that in that year\r\nhe was appointed Professor of Astronomy in the University of Königsberg,\r\nand was chosen to superintend the erection of the new observatory there.\r\nWithin a few years a clerk in a commercial office had worked his way\r\nfrom obscurity to fame.\r\n\r\nIn 1813 the Königsberg Observatory was completed, and here Bessel worked\r\nfor thirty-three years, until his death, on March 17, 1846. It was only\r\nabout ten years before his death that he commenced his search for the\r\nstellar parallax, with the aid of Fraunhofer’s magnificent heliometer.\r\nHe determined to make a series of measures on a small double star of the\r\nfifth magnitude in the constellation Cygnus, named 61 Cygni, the large\r\nproper motion of which led him to suspect its proximity to the Solar\r\nSystem. From August 1837 to September 1838 he made observations on 61\r\nCygni, and he found that there was an annual displacement which could\r\nonly be attributed to parallax. In order to have no mistake, he made\r\nanother year’s observations, which confirmed the results he arrived at\r\npreviously, and all doubt was removed by a third series. The resulting\r\nparallax was 0·3483″, corresponding to a distance of 600,000 times the\r\nEarth’s distance from the Sun. This was confirmed some years later by C.\r\nA. F. Peters at Pulkowa, and still later by Otto Struve, who estimated\r\nthe distance at forty billions of miles. Meanwhile, F. G. W. Struve,\r\nworking at Pulkowa, found a parallax of 0·2613″ for Vega, but this was\r\nafterwards found to be considerably in error. Accordingly, Struve does\r\nnot rank with Bessel as a successful measurer of star-distance. But\r\nindependently of Bessel, another accurate measure had been made by\r\n_Thomas Henderson_, the great Scottish astronomer.\r\n\r\nBorn in Dundee in 1798, Thomas Henderson was the youngest of five\r\nchildren of a hard-working tradesman. After education in his native town\r\nhe went to Edinburgh, where he worked for years as an advocate’s clerk,\r\npursuing studies in astronomy as a recreation from his boyhood. In 1831\r\nhe had become so well known, that he received the appointment of\r\nAstronomer-Royal at the new observatory at the Cape of Good Hope. But\r\nthe climate of South Africa did not suit his health, and after a year he\r\nreturned to Scotland. In 1834 he became Professor of Astronomy in the\r\nUniversity of Edinburgh, and Astronomer-Royal of Scotland, which\r\nposition he held till his death on November 23, 1844, at the early age\r\nof forty-six.\r\n\r\nDuring a year’s work at the Cape, Henderson undertook a series of\r\nobservations on the bright southern star, α Centauri, with a view to\r\ndetermining its parallax. These observations were made in 1832 and 1833,\r\nbut were not reduced until Henderson’s return to Scotland. At length, on\r\nJanuary 3, 1839, he announced to the Royal Astronomical Society that he\r\nhad succeeded in measuring the parallax of α Centauri, which he\r\ndetermined as about one second of arc, corresponding to a distance of\r\nabout twenty billions of miles. This result was confirmed by the\r\nobservations of _Thomas Maclear_ (1794-1879), his successor at the Cape,\r\nand by those of later observers, notably Sir David Gill, who has reduced\r\nthe parallax to 0·75″.\r\n\r\nOther determinations of stellar parallax, some genuine and others\r\nillusory, were made soon after these successful observations. C. A. F.\r\nPeters and Otto Struve at Pulkowa were among the most famous\r\nparallax-hunters in the middle of the century. One of the most\r\nsuccessful searchers after parallax was the German astronomer _Friedrich\r\nBrünnow_ (1821-1891), who was employed from 1865 to 1874 as\r\nAstronomer-Royal of Ireland. He determined the parallax of Vega as\r\n0·13″, and this was confirmed in 1886 by Hall at Washington: while he\r\nmeasured the parallax of the star Groombridge 1830, which turned out to\r\nbe 0·09″. He resigned his post in 1874, and his successor at Dublin\r\nObservatory proved to be his successor also in this branch of astronomy.\r\n_Robert Stawell Ball_, born in Dublin in 1840, was astronomer to Lord\r\nRosse in 1865 and 1866, and became in 1874 Astronomer-Royal of Ireland\r\nin succession to Brünnow, a position which he filled until his\r\nappointment in 1892 as Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge, and director\r\nof the observatory there. During his term of office in Dublin he\r\nundertook, in 1881, a “sweeping search” for large parallaxes, thereby\r\ndisproving certain ideas as to the proximity to the Earth of red and\r\ntemporary stars; while he also determined the parallax of the star 1618\r\nGroombridge.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest extension of our knowledge of stellar distances, in\r\nrecent years, is due to a Scottish astronomer, who has maintained the\r\nreputation of Scotland, and also of the Cape Observatory, in this line\r\nof research. Born in Aberdeen in 1843, _David Gill_ directed Lord\r\nLindsay’s private observatory at Dunecht, in Aberdeenshire, from 1876 to\r\n1879. In the latter year he succeeded _Edward James Stone_ (1831-1897)\r\nas Astronomer-Royal at the Cape, a position which he has since filled\r\nwith conspicuous ability. From 1881 he has been engaged in the hunt for\r\nparallax. In conjunction with _William Lewis Elkin_ (born 1855), now\r\ndirector of Yale College Observatory, he determined the parallaxes of\r\nnine stars with the aid of Lord Lindsay’s heliometer. In 1887, with a\r\nlarger instrument, he resumed the search, while Elkin worked in\r\nco-operation with him, but at Yale Observatory, where he undertook the\r\nmeasurement of the parallaxes of northern stars. He fixed in 1888 an\r\naverage parallax for first-magnitude stars, which was determined at\r\n0·089″, corresponding to a journey for light of thirty-six years.\r\n\r\nMost of the successful determinations of parallax have been made by the\r\n“relative” method—that is, the determination of the displacement of a\r\nstar in reference to another star, assumed to be situated at an\r\nimmeasurable distance. The method of absolute parallax, on the other\r\nhand,—the star’s displacement in right ascension and declination,—has\r\nbeen seldom used, owing to the laborious reduction which has to be gone\r\nthrough before the result can be reached. In 1885, however, a series of\r\nobservations were undertaken at Leyden by _Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn_\r\n(born 1851), who determined by the absolute method the parallaxes of\r\nfifteen northern stars.\r\n\r\nThe first application of photography to the problem was due to the zeal\r\nand energy of _Charles Pritchard_ (1808-1893), Professor of Astronomy at\r\nOxford, who determined by this method the parallax of 61 Cygni, which he\r\nannounced in 1886 to be 0·438″, in agreement with Ball’s determination.\r\nHe also determined the average parallax of second-magnitude stars, which\r\ncame out as 0·056″. Since the time of Pritchard’s observations various\r\nother more or less satisfactory determinations of parallax have been\r\nmade. Few of the parallax determinations are probably very accurate, and\r\nnone exact; but an idea of the difficulty of the measurement may be\r\ngathered from the remark of an American writer, Mr G. P. Serviss, that\r\nthe displacement “is about equal to the apparent distance between the\r\nheads of two pins, placed an inch apart, and viewed from a distance of a\r\nhundred and eighty miles.”\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the question of parallax is the determination of the\r\nexact positions of the stars and the formation of star-catalogues. In\r\nthis branch, too, much is due to the genius of Bessel. The observations\r\nof Bradley at Greenwich from 1750 to 1762 were reduced by Bessel into\r\nthe form of a catalogue, which was published in 1818, with the title of\r\n‘Fundamenta Astronomiæ.’ During the years 1821 to 1823 Bessel took\r\n75,011 observations, by which he brought up the number of accurately\r\nknown stars to 50,000. At the same time notable catalogues had been\r\nconstructed, particularly by the English astronomer, _Francis Baily_\r\n(1774-1844), and by _Giovanni Santini_ (1786-1877), director of the\r\nobservatory at Padua; but Bessel’s successor in this branch of research\r\nwas _Friedrich Wilhelm August Argelander_ (1799-1875). In 1821 he became\r\nassistant to Bessel at Königsberg, in 1823 director of the Observatory\r\nat Abo, in Finland, and in 1837 of that at Bonn. Here he commenced in\r\n1852 the great ‘Bonn Durchmusterung,’ a catalogue and atlas of 324,198\r\nstars visible in the northern hemisphere. The great catalogue was\r\npublished in 1863. After Argelander’s death it was extended so as to\r\ninclude 133,659 stars in the southern hemisphere, by his assistant\r\n_Eduard Schönfeld_ (1828-1891), who succeeded him in 1875 as director of\r\nBonn Observatory, where he died in 1891. Meanwhile a greater undertaking\r\nwas commenced in 1865 by the Astronomische Gesellschaft. This was the\r\nco-operation of thirteen observatories in Europe and America for the\r\nexact determination of the places of 100,000 of Argelander’s stars.\r\n\r\nIn the southern hemisphere, working at Cordova in Argentina, was the\r\ngreat American astronomer, _Gould_, whose ‘Uranometria Argentina,’\r\npublished in 1879, gives the magnitudes of 8198 stars, and whose\r\nArgentine General Catalogue, containing reference of 32,448 stars, was\r\npublished in 1886. The late Radcliffe observer, Stone, published a\r\nuseful catalogue in 1880 from his observations at the Cape.\r\n\r\nThe application of photography to the work of star-charting dates from\r\n1882, when Gill photographed the comet of 1882, and was struck with the\r\ndistinctness of the stars on the background. For some time he had\r\ncontemplated the extension of the ‘Durchmusterung,’ from the point where\r\nSchönfeld left it, to the southern pole, and the idea struck him to\r\nutilise photography for the purpose. In 1885, accordingly, Gill\r\ncommenced work, and in four years all the photographs were taken. The\r\nreduction of the observations into the form of a catalogue was\r\nspontaneously undertaken by the great Dutch astronomer, Kapteyn, who was\r\noccupied with the work for fourteen years, until in 1900 the great\r\ncatalogue, known as the ‘Cape Photographic Durchmusterung,’ was\r\ncompleted. Half a million stars are represented on the plates taken at\r\nthe Cape.\r\n\r\nBy the time the ‘Durchmusterung’ was completed, a greater undertaking\r\nwas in progress. Paul and Prosper Henry, astronomers at the Paris\r\nObservatory, when engaged in continuing Chacornac’s ecliptic charts,\r\napplied photography to their work, and found it very successful.\r\nAccordingly Gill’s proposal, on June 4, 1886, of an International\r\nCongress of Astronomers, to undertake a photographic survey of the\r\nheavens, was enthusiastically received by the French astronomers. The\r\nCongress met at Paris in 1887, under the presidentship of _Amédée\r\nMouchez_ (1821-1892), director of the Paris Observatory, fifty-six\r\nastronomers of all nations being present. The Congress resolved to\r\nconstruct a Photographic Chart, and a Catalogue, the former containing\r\ntwenty million stars, the latter a million and a quarter. Meetings were\r\nheld in Paris in 1891, 1893, 1896, and 1900 to superintend the progress\r\nof the work, which is now (1906) well advanced towards completion.\r\n\r\nA unique star catalogue is in course of preparation by the Scottish\r\nastronomer, _William Peck_ (born 1862), astronomer to the City of\r\nEdinburgh since 1889. Mr Peck’s catalogue is accompanied by a series of\r\ncharts. His star-magnitudes are those of all famous catalogues reduced\r\nto a standard scale. This catalogue, the result of more than fifteen\r\nyears’ work, will be an important addition to the many valuable works of\r\nthe kind already in existence, and will further increase the already\r\ngreat reputation of Scotsmen in practical astronomy.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the proper motions of the stars is another\r\nimportant branch of practical astronomy in which much progress has been\r\nmade since the time of Herschel. Stars with much larger proper motions\r\nthan those of the first magnitude have been discovered. For many years\r\nthe small sixth-magnitude star in Ursa Major, 1830 Groombridge, was\r\nsupposed to be the swiftest of the stars, and was named by Newcomb the\r\n“runaway star.” But in 1897, on examining the plates of the ‘Cape\r\nDurchmusterung,’ Kapteyn discovered a still swifter star of the eighth\r\nmagnitude, situated in the southern constellation, Pictor. The rate of\r\nits motion is over eight seconds of arc yearly; and an idea of the vast\r\ndistance of the stars may be obtained by the statement that it would\r\ntake 200 years for the star—known as Gould’s Cordova Zones, V Hour\r\n243—to move over a space equal to the moon’s diameter. Important\r\nobservations have been made on the stellar motions, and on their bearing\r\non the structure of the Universe, by various astronomers, including J.\r\nC. Kapteyn and _Ludwig Struve_ (born 1858), son of Otto Struve; but\r\nthese must be reserved for a later chapter.\r\n\r\nRichard Anthony Proctor, born at Chelsea, in London, in 1837, graduated\r\nat Cambridge in 1860. For the next twenty-eight years he earned his\r\nliving by publishing many volumes on astronomy, popular and technical,\r\nfifty-seven having appeared at the time of his death, which took place\r\nat New York on September 12, 1888. Notwithstanding the vast amount of\r\nwork bestowed on his books, his original investigations were permanent\r\ncontributions to astronomical science. In 1870 he undertook to chart the\r\ndirections and amounts of 1600 proper motions. While engaged on this\r\nwork, it occurred to him that it would be “desirable and useful to\r\nsearch for subordinate laws of motion.” He found, from the laborious\r\nprocess of charting, that five of the seven stars of the Plough had a\r\nmotion in common—that is to say, were moving in the same direction at\r\nthe same rate. This phenomenon was termed by Proctor “star-drift.” He\r\nalso recognised other instances of star-drift in other portions of the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nThe subject was soon afterwards taken up by the French astronomer,\r\nCamille Flammarion. Born in 1842 at Montigny-le-Roi, in Haute Marne,\r\nFlammarion was appointed assistant to Le Verrier in 1858, but gave up\r\nhis post in 1862. Employed successively at the Bureau des Longitudes,\r\nand as editor of scientific papers, he founded in 1882 his private\r\nobservatory at Juvisy-sur-Orge, where he has since continued his\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nFollowing up Proctor’s discovery of star-drift, Flammarion drew charts\r\nof proper motions. He demonstrated the “common proper motion” of Regulus\r\nand an eighth-magnitude star, Lalande 19,749, from a comparison of his\r\nmeasures in 1877 with those of Christian Mayer a century previously;\r\nwhile he discovered many other instances. His reflections on these\r\nmotions, as given in his ‘Popular Astronomy,’ are worthy of\r\nreproduction: “Such are the stupendous motions which carry every sun,\r\nevery system, every world, all life, and all destiny in all directions\r\nof the infinite immensity, through the boundless, bottomless abyss; in a\r\nvoid for ever open, ever yawning, ever black, and ever unfathomable;\r\nduring an eternity, without days, without years, without centuries, or\r\nmeasures. Such is the aspect, grand, splendid, and sublime, of the\r\nuniverse which flies through space before the dazzled and stupefied gaze\r\nof the terrestrial astronomer, born to-day to die to-morrow, on a\r\nglobule lost in the infinite night.”\r\n\r\nMeasures of proper motion only enable us to determine the motion of\r\nstars across the line of sight. They do not tell us whether the star is\r\nadvancing or receding. Here, however, the spectroscope comes to our aid\r\nby means of Doppler’s principle, described in the chapter on the Sun. It\r\noccurred to Huggins that, by observing the displacement of the lines in\r\nthe spectra of the stars, he could determine their motion in the line of\r\nsight. His first results were announced in 1868. In the case of Sirius,\r\nthe displacement of the line marked F was believed to indicate a\r\nvelocity of recession of 29 miles a second. Some time later Huggins\r\nannounced that Betelgeux, Rigel, Castor, and Regulus were retreating,\r\nwhile Arcturus, Pollux, Vega, and Deneb were approaching. Soon after\r\nthis successful work the subject was taken up by Maunder at Greenwich\r\nand by Vogel at Bothkamp; but the delicacy of the measurements prevented\r\nsatisfactory results from being reached through visual observations, and\r\naccordingly the measurements were very discordant.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 H. C. Vogel, working at Potsdam Astrophysical Observatory,\r\napplied photography to the measurement of radial motion. Assisted by\r\n_Julius Scheiner_ (born 1858), he determined the radial motions of\r\nfifty-one bright stars by photographing the stellar spectra and\r\nmeasuring the photographs. Vogel found 10 miles a second to be the\r\naverage velocity of stars in the line of sight, the tendency of the eye\r\nbeing to exaggerate the displacements. The swiftest of the stars\r\nmeasured by Vogel proved to be Aldebaran, with a velocity of recession\r\nof 30 miles a second. Since 1892 the subject has been pursued by Vogel\r\nhimself with the new 30-inch refractor at Potsdam, by Campbell at the\r\nLick Observatory, Bélopolsky at Pulkowa, and other observers. Towards\r\nthe end of 1896 Campbell undertook, with the 36-inch Lick refractor, a\r\nseries of measures on radial motion, and many important discoveries were\r\nmade. These, however, must be reserved for the chapter dealing with\r\ndouble stars.\r\n\r\nHerschel’s great discovery, from the apparent motions of the stars, of\r\nthe movement of the Solar System was not accepted by the next generation\r\nof astronomers. Bessel declared in 1818 that there was absolutely no\r\nevidence to show that the Sun was moving towards Hercules. Even Sir John\r\nHerschel rejected his father’s views, although some confirmatory results\r\nhad been reached by Gauss. At length, in 1837, Argelander, in a\r\nmemorable paper, based on his observations at Abo, in Finland, attacked\r\nthe problem, and demonstrated, from a discussion of the motions of 390\r\nstars, quite independently of Herschel’s work, that the Solar System was\r\nmoving towards Hercules. This was confirmed in 1841 by Otto Struve, in\r\n1847 by _Thomas Galloway_, and in 1859 and 1863 by Airy and _Edwin\r\nDunkin_ (1821-1898), assistant at Greenwich Observatory.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in 1886, _Arthur Auwers_, permanent Secretary of the Berlin\r\nAcademy of Sciences, completed the re-reduction of Bradley’s\r\nobservations at Greenwich, and brought out 300 reliable proper motions,\r\nwhich were utilised by Ludwig Struve, whose investigation removed the\r\nsolar apex from Hercules to the neighbouring constellation Lyra: this\r\nslight change was confirmed by _Oscar Stumpe_, of Bonn, and _Lewis_\r\n_Boss_ (born 1847), director of the Observatory at Albany, New York. An\r\ninvestigation by Newcomb fully confirmed the previous results. In 1900,\r\n1901, and 1902 Kapteyn made three distinct investigations on the solar\r\nmotion, and still further confirmed the previous investigations.\r\n\r\nThese investigations are fully confirmed by the application to the\r\nquestion of Doppler’s principle of measuring radial motion. The\r\nspectroscopic researches of Campbell at the Lick Observatory place the\r\nsolar apex very near the position assigned to it by Newcomb and Kapteyn.\r\nCampbell finds the solar velocity to be about 12 miles a second, and\r\nKapteyn thinks a velocity of about 11 miles a second is “the most\r\nprobable value that can at present be adopted.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n                        THE LIGHT OF THE STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n“That a science of stellar chemistry should not only have become\r\npossible, but should already have made material advances, is assuredly\r\none of the most amazing features in the swift progress of knowledge our\r\nage has witnessed.” So writes Miss Agnes Mary Clerke, the historian of\r\nmodern astronomy. As long ago as 1823 Fraunhofer observed the spectra of\r\nthe brighter stars, and gathered the first hint of the grouping of the\r\nstars into three classes. Then, after Fraunhofer’s death, the subject\r\nlay in abeyance for thirty-seven years. At length, in 1860, on\r\nKirchhoff’s explanation of the Fraunhofer lines, the study of stellar\r\nspectra was inaugurated at Florence by Donati, who carefully fixed the\r\npositions of the more important lines. His instrumental means, however,\r\nwere very limited, and his observations were not successful. In 1862\r\nRutherfurd, in New York, commenced the study of stellar spectra, but\r\nshortly afterwards turned his attention to astronomical photography. The\r\nactual founders of stellar spectroscopy were the eminent Italian\r\nobserver, Angelo Secchi, and the illustrious Englishman, William\r\nHuggins.\r\n\r\nAngelo Secchi was born in 1818 at Reggio, in the Emilia. Educated in the\r\nCollegio Romano, he was ordained priest in 1847, but his love of\r\nscience, and particularly astronomy, dates from the beginning of his\r\ncareer. In 1849 he succeeded Di Vico as director of the Observatory of\r\nthe Collegio Romano. This post he filled with conspicuous ability for a\r\nperiod of twenty-nine years, until his death on February 26, 1878. To\r\nSecchi is due the credit of the first spectroscopic survey of the\r\nheavens. He reviewed the spectra of 4000 stars, and classified them into\r\nfour distinct groups, which are recognised to this day. The first type\r\nembraces over half of those which Secchi examined. This type is\r\nrepresented by Sirius, Vega, Altair, and other bluish-white stars, and\r\nis characterised by the intensity of the hydrogen lines. The second type\r\nembraces the yellow stars, such as Capella, Arcturus, Aldebaran, Pollux,\r\nand the Sun itself, and is known as the Solar type. The spectra of these\r\nstars closely resemble that of the Sun, and are distinguished by\r\ninnumerable lines. Secchi’s third type, or red stars, represented by\r\nBetelgeux, Antares, and others, are characterised by strong absorption\r\nbands, and the spectra have been described as “fluted.” The third-type\r\nstars are comparatively scarce compared with the first and second, and\r\nthe fourth is even less numerous. The fourth-type stars are also red\r\nwith broad absorption lines. To Secchi’s four types a fifth was added in\r\n1867 by Wolf and Rayet of Paris Observatory—namely, the gaseous stars.\r\nSecchi aimed at a comprehensive survey of the stellar spectra, and he\r\naccomplished much valuable work. He did not devote his time to analysing\r\nindividual stars. This branch of study—analysis of spectra and the\r\ndetermination of the elements in the stars—was undertaken by his\r\ncontemporary, William Huggins, one of the greatest astronomers whom\r\nEngland has ever produced.\r\n\r\nBorn in London in 1824, William Huggins commenced his astronomical\r\nresearches at the age of twenty-eight. In 1856 he erected, at Tulse\r\nHill, London, an observatory which he equipped at great expense. He\r\ncommenced observations on the usual astronomical lines, taking times of\r\ntransits and making drawings of the surfaces of the planets. But he soon\r\ntired of the routine of ordinary astronomical work, and on the\r\npublication of Kirchhoff’s explanation of the Fraunhofer lines in the\r\nsolar spectrum, he commenced to investigate the spectra of the stars.\r\nHaving constructed a suitable spectroscope, he commenced observations in\r\n1862 in conjunction with his friend, William Allen Miller, Professor of\r\nChemistry in London. He exhaustively investigated the two red stars,\r\nBetelgeux and Aldebaran, ascertaining the existence in the former star\r\nof sodium, iron, calcium, magnesium, and bismuth; and in the latter star\r\nthe same elements, with the addition of tellurium, antimony, and\r\nmercury.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 Huggins made an attempt to photograph the spectra of the stars,\r\nand, indeed, obtained prints of Sirius and Capella, but no lines were\r\nvisible in them. In 1874 Draper of New York obtained a photograph of the\r\nspectrum of Vega, showing four lines. Two years later Huggins again\r\nattacked the problem, and secured a photograph of the spectrum of Vega,\r\nshowing seven strong lines. In 1879 he was enabled to communicate\r\nsatisfactory results of his work to the Royal Society, and since then he\r\nhas secured many admirable representations. In 1899 the monumental work,\r\n‘An Atlas of Representative Stellar Spectra,’ the joint work of Sir\r\nWilliam and Lady Huggins, was published.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the German Government established at Potsdam the Astrophysical\r\nObservatory, for the spectroscopic study of the Sun and stars. A\r\nposition on the staff was given to Hermann Carl Vogel, whose researches\r\nin astronomical spectroscopy rank with those of Secchi and Huggins. Born\r\nin Leipzig in 1842, he was from 1865 to 1869 employed in the Leipzig\r\nObservatory. Called to Bothkamp as director in 1870, he resigned his\r\npost in 1874 to accept a position on the staff at Potsdam Observatory.\r\nIn 1882 he became director of that Institution, which position he still\r\nretains.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 Vogel revised Secchi’s classification of stellar spectra, and in\r\n1895 he further improved on it. His classification improves rather than\r\nsupersedes the previous work of Secchi; nevertheless, he approached the\r\nquestion from a different standpoint. Vogel concluded in 1874 that a\r\nrational scheme of stellar classification “can only be arrived at by\r\nproceeding from the standpoint that the phrase of development of the\r\nparticular body is, in general, mirrored in its spectrum.” Vogel divides\r\nSecchi’s first type into three classes. In the first type, designated\r\nI_a_,—represented by Sirius and Vega,—the metallic lines are “very faint\r\nand fine,” and the hydrogen lines conspicuous. In I_b_ no hydrogen lines\r\nare visible, while in I_c_ the hydrogen lines are bright. This class\r\nincludes the gaseous stars. In 1895, after the recognition of helium in\r\nthe stars by his assistant, Scheiner, Vogel separated the stars of class\r\nI_b_ from the first type altogether. These stars are sometimes\r\ndesignated as “Type O,” and sometimes as helium stars and Orion stars,\r\nas the majority of the stars in Orion are of that type. The solar type\r\nis divided into two classes, II_a_ being represented by the Sun,\r\nCapella, and other well-known stars, while II_b_ includes the Wolf-Rayet\r\nstars. Secchi’s third and fourth types are both classified by Vogel as\r\nof the third type. These red stars were specially studied from 1878 to\r\n1884 by Dunér at Lund. His results were published in a descriptive\r\ncatalogue which appeared at Stockholm in 1884. His researches related to\r\nthe spectra of 352 stars, 297 of Secchi’s third type and 55 of his\r\nfourth. Dunér is perhaps the greatest authority on stars with banded\r\nspectra.\r\n\r\nVogel’s classification of spectra is generally adopted by astronomers,\r\nalthough others have been proposed by Lockyer and by _Edward Charles\r\nPickering_ (born 1846), director of the Harvard Observatory. Lockyer’s\r\nclassification was designed to fit in with his “meteoritic hypothesis,”\r\ndiscussed in the chapter on Celestial Evolution. The stars were divided\r\nby Lockyer into seven groups, according to his views of their\r\ntemperature, rising through gaseous stars, red stars of Secchi’s third\r\ntype, and a division of solar stars to the Sirian type, and falling\r\nthrough a second division of the solar type to red stars of Secchi’s\r\nfourth type.\r\n\r\nThe first spectroscopic star-catalogue was published in 1883 by Vogel,\r\nassisted by _Gustav Müller_ (born 1851), a son-in-law of Spörer. The\r\ncatalogue contained details of 4051 stars to the seventh magnitude, and\r\nmore than half of these proved to be of Secchi’s first type. Vogel’s\r\nwork was completed in different latitudes by Dunér at Upsala, and by\r\n_Nicolaus Thege von Konkoly_ (born 1842) at O’Gyalla in Hungary.\r\n\r\nThe famous ‘Draper Catalogue’ ranks as the greatest catalogue of stellar\r\nspectra. It was undertaken at Harvard Observatory by E. C. Pickering, in\r\nthe form of a memorial to Henry Draper, the successful spectroscopist.\r\nCommenced in 1886, and published in 1890, it contains photographs of the\r\nspectra of no fewer than 10,351 stars, down to the eighth magnitude.\r\nPickering subdivided Secchi’s types into various classes, the first or\r\nSirian into four classes, the second into eight, while the third and\r\nfourth types each constitute a separate class. Pickering designated his\r\nclasses by the capital letters of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nMuch useful work has been done also in the analysis of the various\r\nspectra. Julius Scheiner, now “chief observer” at Potsdam Astrophysical\r\nObservatory, has, since 1890, done much valuable work in this direction.\r\nSpecial attention was devoted to the spectrum of Capella, 490 lines in\r\nthe spectrum of which were measured by Scheiner. In his own words, “he\r\nbelieves a complete proof of the absolute agreement between its spectrum\r\nand that of the Sun to be thereby furnished.” Other stars of the Sirian\r\nand solar classes were exhaustively studied by Scheiner.\r\n\r\nThe study of the exact brilliance of the stars was a branch of research\r\nlong neglected, yet it is of much importance in astronomy, for it is\r\nonly through exact measurement of stellar brilliance that stellar\r\nvariation can be detected. Herschel commenced the study, which was\r\ncontinued by his son at the Cape, but it is only within the last twenty\r\nyears that stellar photometry has become a recognised branch of\r\nastronomy; and the credit of this is due to the energy and zeal of the\r\ngreat American observer, Edward Charles Pickering.\r\n\r\nBorn in Boston in 1846, Edward Charles Pickering was appointed in 1865\r\nInstructor of mathematics in the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard,\r\nafter a distinguished university career. In 1876 he succeeded Winlock as\r\ndirector of the Harvard Observatory, and in the following year he\r\ncommenced his photometric studies. He invented an instrument named the\r\nmeridian photometer, with the aid of which he succeeded in determining,\r\nin the years 1879 to 1882, the exact brilliance of 4260 stars to the\r\nsixth magnitude between the north celestial pole and thirty degrees of\r\nsouth declination. At a later date he devised a larger photometer, with\r\nwhich he made over one million observations. Pickering next extended his\r\nsurvey to the southern hemisphere, erecting the photometer on the slope\r\nof the Andes, where the Harvard auxiliary station at Arequipa is now\r\nlocated, and where 8000 determinations of stellar brilliance were made.\r\nMeanwhile Pritchard, at Oxford, published in 1885 his ‘Uranometria Nova\r\nOxoniensis,’ with photometric determinations of the brilliance of 2784\r\nstars from the pole to ten degrees of south declination. Both of these\r\ncatalogues were epoch-making works, and testify to the enthusiasm and\r\nperseverance of the astronomers who designed them.\r\n\r\nThe study of stellar photometry glides into that of stellar variation.\r\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century the number of known variable\r\nstars was very small, as a glance at the list given in Brewster’s\r\nedition of Ferguson’s Astronomy (1811) will show. Some remarkable\r\ninvestigations were due to the English astronomer, _John Goodricke_\r\n(1764-1786), who rediscovered the variability of the star Algol, and\r\naccurately determined its period in 1782. Goodricke suggested that the\r\nregular variations in the light of Algol were due to the partial eclipse\r\nof its light by a dark satellite, a hypothesis now fully confirmed. Two\r\nyears later, in 1784, Goodricke discovered other two variables, δ Cephei\r\nand β Lyræ. He died in 1786 at the age of twenty-one, and thus\r\nvariable-star astronomy was deprived of its founder.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of variable-star astronomy as an exact branch of the\r\nscience is due to Argelander. In the years 1837-1845, while residing at\r\nBonn during the erection of the observatory, of which he had been made\r\ndirector, he erected a temporary observatory, and there he carefully\r\ndetermined the magnitudes of all stars visible in Central Europe. From\r\nthis he was led to the discussion of stellar variation, to which subject\r\nhe continued to give much attention. He was the first to describe a\r\nmethod of observing variable stars scientifically and accurately,—a\r\nmethod consisting in estimating in “steps” or “grades” the difference in\r\nbrilliance between the variable, or suspected variable, and other stars\r\nwhich are selected for comparison, and which are of various degrees of\r\nbrilliance, so that they may be available for comparison with the\r\nvariable throughout its fluctuations. Argelander’s “steps” are tenths of\r\na magnitude, and Gore describes the method of observation as follows:\r\n“If we call _a_ and _b_ the comparison stars, and _v_ the variable, _a_\r\nbeing brighter than _b_, and if _v_ is judged to be midway in brightness\r\nbetween _a_ and _b_, we write _a_5_v_5_b_. If _v_ is slightly nearer to\r\n_b_, we write _a_6_v_4_b_. We may also write _a_3_v_7_b_, or\r\n_a_7_v_3_b_, the sum of the steps being always ten.”\r\n\r\nThis method, described in 1844, led to many discoveries at Bonn in the\r\nfollowing twenty years by Argelander and his assistants Schmidt and\r\nSchönfeld. At this time Eduard Heis (1806-1877), at Münster, who also\r\nranks as one of the founders of meteoric astronomy, while engaged on the\r\nconstruction of his great atlas, attentively determined the change of\r\nmagnitude of stars visible to the naked eye; and by means of the naked\r\neye, the opera-glass, and a small telescope, he amassed a large number\r\nof observations. At the same time two English observers, Hind and\r\nPogson, were making remarkable discoveries which greatly increased the\r\nnumber of known variables. Among Hind’s discoveries were S Cancri of the\r\nAlgol type; while Schmidt discovered another of the same class, δ Libræ,\r\nand also the famous ζ Geminorum. While director of the Observatory of\r\nMannheim, an institution equipped with very antiquated instruments,\r\nSchönfeld devoted himself to the study of variable stars, and increased\r\nthe number of known variables considerably. In the southern hemisphere\r\nGould, in South America, did for the observation of variable stars what\r\nArgelander did in the northern.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 a very important, although not so obvious, service to\r\nvariable-star astronomy was rendered by the Danish observer, _Hans Carl\r\nFredrik Christian Schjellerup_ (1827-1887). He translated from Arabic\r\ninto French the works of the Persian astronomer of a thousand years ago,\r\nAl-Sufi, and thus rendered his observations available to modern\r\nastronomers. Al-Sufi was a most accurate observer, and, by comparing his\r\ncatalogue with those of modern observers, it can be found whether stars\r\nhave changed in brilliance during the past thousand years.\r\n\r\nThe study of variable stars has been pursued in recent years by many\r\nastronomers, both by means of photography and by the visual method. The\r\nmost important names in the visual discovery of variables are Gustav\r\nMüller and _Paul Friedrich Ferdinand Kempf_ (born 1856) of Potsdam;\r\n_Alexander William Roberts_ of Lovedale, South Africa; Seth Carlo\r\nChandler of Boston; Nils Christopher Dunér at Upsala; and _John Ellard\r\nGore_ (born 1845) in Dublin.\r\n\r\nThe researches of J. E. Gore are a brilliant example of how much may be\r\ndone for astronomy by means of very moderate instruments. Born in 1845\r\nat Athlone, in Connaught, he went to India in 1868 as engineer on the\r\nSirhind Canal in the Punjab. While in India he erected his small\r\ntelescopes on brick pillars, and took observations, many of them of\r\nstellar brilliance. In 1879 he returned to Ireland, and since then has\r\ndevoted himself to astronomy with zeal and enthusiasm. His discoveries\r\nand investigations of variables have been made by means of the\r\nbinocular. On December 13, 1885, he discovered a remarkable star in\r\nOrion, which was at first considered to be temporary, and called “Nova\r\nOrionis,” but was afterwards found to be a long-period variable star.\r\n\r\nRecently photography has come much to the front in the discovery of\r\nvariable stars. Pickering at Harvard, and Wolf at Heidelberg, have\r\nparticularly distinguished themselves in this branch, and the number of\r\nknown variables is now very large, as every year brings fresh\r\ndiscoveries, mostly by aid of photography. Many of these\r\nnewly-discovered variables are in star-clusters and nebulæ.\r\n\r\nPickering proposed in 1880 the following classification of variable\r\nstars, which has been adopted all over the scientific world: Class I.,\r\ntemporary star; Class II., stars undergoing in several months large\r\nvariations, such as Mira Ceti and U Orionis; Class III., irregular\r\nvariables, such as Betelgeux and α Herculis; Class IV., short-period\r\nvariables, such as δ Cephei, ζ Geminorum, and β Lyræ; Class V., “Algol\r\nvariables,” which undergo variations lasting but a few hours. It is\r\ndoubtful whether new stars should be included in a classification of\r\nvariables, although in one case, at least, a new star was found to be a\r\nlong-period variable. To these a sixth class may now be added. This\r\nclass, the detection of which is mainly due to the profound\r\ninvestigations of Gore, is composed of what have been termed “secular\r\nvariables,” which undergo slow fluctuations in periods of many years,\r\nand sometimes of centuries. This Class includes δ Ursæ Majoris, Al-Fard,\r\nλ Draconis, θ Serpentis, ε Pegasi, 83 Ursæ Majoris, ζ Piscis Australis,\r\nβ Leonis, α Ophiuchi, η Crateris, and others. The secular variations of\r\nsome of these stars have been detected by Gore himself during the past\r\nthirty years, while in other cases he has detected them by comparison of\r\nthe most important star-catalogues, from Hipparchus and Al-Sufi down to\r\nour own time. In some cases the star in question seems to be slowly\r\ngaining in brilliance, in others slowly diminishing.\r\n\r\nThanks to the application of the spectroscope, much is now known of the\r\ncause of the light changes in variable stars. Goodricke’s theory of the\r\nvariations of Algol was theoretically confirmed by the researches of E.\r\nC. Pickering in 1880. In 1889 Vogel proved beyond a doubt that the\r\nvariation in the light of Algol is due to the partial eclipse of its\r\nlight by a dark satellite. It was obvious to Vogel that, as both Algol\r\nand its companion are in revolution round their common centre of\r\ngravity, the motion of Algol in the line of sight might be detected by\r\nthe spectroscopic method of observation. Vogel found that before each\r\neclipse Algol was retreating from our system, while on recovering it\r\ngave signs of rapid approach, proving conclusively that both the star\r\nand its dark satellite were in revolution round their centre of\r\ngravity,—Algol suffering partial eclipse only because the plane of the\r\norbit lies in our line of sight. Algol, therefore, is not inherently a\r\nvariable star, but merely a binary. Following up his researches, Vogel,\r\nassuming that the bright and dark stars are of equal density, arrived at\r\nthe conclusion that Algol is a globe about one and a half million miles\r\nin diameter, the satellite equalling the size of the Sun, and the\r\ncentres of the stars being separated by about 3,230,000 miles. Thus,\r\nvariable stars of the Algol type are not variable in the true sense of\r\nthe word. Even the most irregular of the Algol variables have been\r\nexplained. Perhaps the most irregular was Y Cygni, discovered by\r\nChandler in 1886. It was soon found, however, that the variations\r\nrecurred with great irregularity: in less than two years the phases\r\ndiffered by as much as seven hours from the predicted times. At length\r\nthe subject was taken up by Dunér at Upsala. A series of observations\r\nmade with the 14-inch refractor at Upsala in 1891 and 1892 convinced him\r\nin the latter year that two eclipses take place in the course of one\r\nrevolution: one star occults the other. Dunér showed that the intervals\r\nbetween minima were thus—1 day 9 hours; 1 day 15 hours; 1 day 9 hours,\r\nand so on. Thus, the first, third, fifth, and seventh sets of minima\r\nobeyed a different law from the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth. Dunér\r\nproved that two stars revolve round their centre of gravity in less than\r\nthree days, alternately occulting each other, while the ellipticity of\r\nthe orbit explains the irregularity of the light changes. In April 1900\r\nDunér gave his final conclusions as follows: “The variable star Y Cygni\r\nconsists of two stars of equal size and equal brightness, which move\r\nabout their common centre of gravity in an elliptical orbit, whose major\r\naxis is eight times the radius of the stars.” He also stated the exact\r\nperiod of revolution and the eccentricity of the orbit.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the short-period variables, such as β Lyræ, δ Cephei, ζ\r\nGeminorum, and η Aquilæ, the variations do not seem to be due to\r\neclipse. It was discovered by Professor Pickering that β Lyræ is a\r\nspectroscopic binary, but Vogel and Keeler showed that the supposed\r\norbit is incompatible with the eclipse theory. Vogel says: “I am\r\nconvinced that β Lyræ represents a binary or multiple system, the\r\nfundamental revolutions of which in 12 days 22 hours in some way control\r\nthe light change.” The eclipse theory, however, is still maintained by\r\nBélopolsky, who has framed a hypothesis according to which the chief\r\nminimum of the star’s light corresponds with the obscuration of the\r\nlesser star, the lesser minimum with that of the primary, implying that\r\nthe primary is much less luminous in proportion to its light than its\r\nsatellite,—a state of affairs which Miss Clerke concludes to be\r\nimprobable.\r\n\r\nThe variable stars, δ Cephei and η Aquilæ, were both found in 1894 by\r\nBélopolsky to be binaries; but as the times of minimum light do not\r\ncorrespond with those of eclipses in the hypothetical orbits, he\r\nconcludes that the variations cannot be explained on the eclipsing\r\nsatellite theory. Miss Clerke is inclined to the theory that the\r\nincrease of luminosity in short-period variables is due to tidal action,\r\nso that while the revolutions of the stars control their variability,\r\nthey are inherently unstable in light. A large number of these stars are\r\nknown, and it is a remarkable fact that the majority of these variables\r\nlie on or near the Galaxy, so that their variations have probably\r\nsomething to do with their vicinity.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the long-period variables of which Mira Ceti, χ Cygni,\r\nand U Orionis are examples. Although varying in regular periods,\r\ngenerally of about a year, they are subject to remarkable\r\nirregularities, so that an exact period cannot be assigned even to Mira\r\nCeti, of which the maxima are at times retarded and at others\r\naccelerated with no apparent law. The spectroscopic investigations of\r\nCampbell in 1898 have shown that Mira Ceti is a solitary star, while\r\nbright lines of hydrogen appear in its spectrum at maximum, showing that\r\nthe variations are due to periodical conflagrations in its atmospheres.\r\nIn many other long-period variables bright lines have been observed.\r\n\r\nA remarkable fact regarding these stars is the amount of their light\r\nchange. Mira Ceti, for instance, varies from the first to the ninth\r\nmagnitude, and U Orionis from the sixth to the twelfth. As M. Flammarion\r\nsays, “the longer the period the greater the variation.” Another\r\nremarkable fact is that their light curves show a curious resemblance to\r\nthe curves of the solar spots, only on a vastly greater scale, which\r\nindicates that, relatively, these long-period variables are much older\r\nthan our Sun, the small variations in the light of which are\r\nimperceptible. “Here, if anywhere,” says Miss Clerke, “will be found the\r\nsecret of stellar variability.”\r\n\r\nTo the irregular variables no period can be assigned. Betelgeux, in\r\nOrion, the variation of which was noted by Sir John Herschel in 1840, is\r\na typically irregular variable. But the most extraordinary of all\r\nvariables is η Argus, in the southern hemisphere, which is probably a\r\nconnecting link between variable and temporary stars. The traveller\r\nBurchell, from 1811 to 1815, observed the star as of the second\r\nmagnitude, but in 1827 he noted it to be of the first magnitude. In the\r\nfollowing year it fell to the second magnitude. In 1834 Sir John\r\nHerschel noted the star to be between the first and second magnitude,\r\nand in 1838 it rose to the first, being equal to α Centauri. After a\r\ndecline, it became in 1843 equal to Canopus, and not much inferior to\r\nSirius. Then it began to fade, and in 1868 it was only of the sixth\r\nmagnitude. In 1899 Innes estimated it as 7·71. Rudolf Wolf suggested a\r\nperiod of 46 years, and Loomis 67 years; but astronomers generally agree\r\nwith Schönfeld that the star has no regular period.\r\n\r\nThe first temporary star of the nineteenth century was discovered by\r\nHind, in London, April 28, 1848. It was of the fifth magnitude at\r\nmaximum, and soon after began to fade, falling to the tenth magnitude.\r\nIn 1860 a new star appeared in the cluster Messier 80 in Scorpio, and\r\nwas discovered by Auwers at Königsberg. It reached only the seventh\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nOn the night of May 12, 1866, a new star of the second magnitude blazed\r\nout in the constellation Corona Borealis. It was first observed at Tuam,\r\nin Ireland, by the Irish astronomer, _John Birmingham_. Four hours\r\nearlier Schmidt had been observing that part of the heavens, and it was\r\nnot then visible. Birmingham at once communicated the discovery to\r\nHuggins, at Tulse Hill, who had commenced his spectroscopic\r\nobservations. On May 16 Huggins observed its spectrum. In the words of\r\nMiss Clerke, “The star showed what was described as a double spectrum.\r\nTo the dusky flutings of Secchi’s third type, four brilliant rays were\r\nadded. The chief of these agreed in position with lines of hydrogen; so\r\nthat the immediate cause of the outburst was plainly perceived to have\r\nbeen the eruption, or ignition, of vast masses of that subtle kind of\r\nmatter.” Nine days after the appearance of the new star it was invisible\r\nto the naked eye, and afterwards fell to the tenth magnitude. In 1856\r\nSchönfeld had observed it at Bonn as a telescopic star, so that it was\r\nnot a “new star” in the true sense of the word.\r\n\r\nThe next temporary star observed was discovered by Schmidt, at Athens,\r\nNovember 24, 1876. It was of the third magnitude, situated in the\r\nconstellation Cygnus. On December 2 its spectrum was examined at Paris\r\nby _Alfred Cornu_ (1841-1902), and some days later at Potsdam by Vogel\r\nand Lohse. It was closely similar to that of the new star of 1866,\r\nbright lines of hydrogen and other elements standing out in front of an\r\n“absorption” spectrum. By the end of 1876 the star was of the seventh\r\nmagnitude. On September 2, 1877, Nova Cygni was observed at Dunecht, and\r\nits spectrum was found to have been transformed into that of a planetary\r\nnebula. Three years later, however, the ordinary stellar spectrum\r\nreappeared.\r\n\r\nA new star appeared in the centre of the great nebula in Andromeda in\r\nAugust 1885. The first announcement of the discovery was by _Karl Ernst\r\nAlbrecht Hartwig_ (born 1851), who observed the new star on August 31;\r\nbut it had been previously seen by several other observers. On September\r\n1 it was of the seventh magnitude, and by March of the following year\r\nhad fallen to the sixteenth. Observed by Vogel, Young, and Hasselberg,\r\nthe new star gave a continuous spectrum, but Huggins and Copeland\r\nsucceeded in discerning bright lines. Hall, at Washington, undertook a\r\nseries of measures to detect the parallax of Nova Andromedæ, but his\r\nefforts were unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the next temporary star was announced February 1, 1892,\r\nby the Rev. _Thomas_ _D. Anderson_, a Scottish amateur astronomer, in a\r\npost-card to the Astronomer-Royal of Scotland. The star was situated in\r\nthe constellation Auriga. An examination of photographs, taken at\r\nHarvard Observatory, showed that the new star had appeared December 10,\r\n1891, and had risen to a maximum of the fourth magnitude ten days later.\r\nOn a photograph taken by Max Wolf on December 8 the new star was not\r\nvisible. After Anderson’s visual discovery, the spectrum of the new star\r\nwas studied by Copeland, Huggins, Lockyer, Vogel, Campbell, and others.\r\nBright hydrogen lines were visible in the spectrum, which appeared to be\r\nactually double, giving support to the theory that the outburst was the\r\nresult of a collision between two dark bodies; and this was confirmed by\r\nthe measurements of radial motion by the Potsdam astronomers.\r\n\r\nAfter March 9, 1892, the new star steadily faded, falling to the\r\nsixteenth magnitude on April 26. But on August 17 _Edward Singelton\r\nHolden_ (born 1846), director of the Lick Observatory, and his\r\nassistants, Schaeberle and Campbell, found it of the tenth magnitude. On\r\nAugust 19 Barnard found it transformed into a planetary nebula: while\r\nvarious spectroscopic observations of the revived Nova revealed the\r\nnebular lines. By the end of 1894 the new star had faded to the eleventh\r\nmagnitude, and early in 1901 was observed as a minute nebula.\r\n\r\nAfter 1892 several new stars appeared, and were detected on photographic\r\nplates by _Mrs Fleming_ (born 1857), of Harvard Observatory. The first\r\nof these, in the southern constellation Norma, was discovered in 1893 by\r\nits peculiar spectrum on a Draper spectrographic plate taken at Harvard.\r\nBut the new star rose only to the seventh magnitude. Other new stars\r\nwere discovered in Carina (Argo) in 1895, in Centaurus in 1895, in\r\nSagittarius in 1898, and in Aquila in 1900. Nova Sagittarii was, at its\r\nbrightest, fully equal to Nova Aurigæ, and was plainly visible to the\r\nnaked eye, but was never observed visually.\r\n\r\nA temporary star, appropriately designated “the new star of the new\r\ncentury,” blazed out in Perseus on the night of February 21, 1901. It\r\nwas discovered independently by several observers: on February 21, by\r\nBorisiak, a student at Kiev, in Russia; on the following morning, by\r\nAnderson in Edinburgh; and on the next evening, by Gore at Dublin,\r\nNordvig in Denmark, Grimmler at Erlangen, and other observers. When\r\nfirst seen by Anderson, it was equal to Algol, of the second magnitude.\r\nA photograph by Williams at Brighton showed that it must have been\r\nfainter than the twelfth magnitude on February 20. On the evening of\r\nFebruary 23 the star was brighter than Capella, and was then the\r\nbrightest star in the northern hemisphere. On February 25 it fell to the\r\nfirst magnitude; on March 1 to the second, and on March 6 to the third.\r\nDuring the spring and summer the light fluctuated considerably, but in\r\nSeptember and October faded to the 6·7 magnitude. In March 1902 it was\r\nof the eighth magnitude, and in July 1903 of the twelfth.\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of Nova Persei was found by Pickering to be of the Orion\r\ntype on February 22 and 23. On February 24 the spectrum had become one\r\nof the bright and dark lines, and the hydrogen lines indicated a\r\nvelocity of 700 to 1000 miles a second. Measures of the sodium and\r\ncalcium lines, by Campbell and others, indicated a velocity of only\r\nthree miles a second, so that the displacements of the hydrogen lines\r\nmay have been due to an outburst of hydrogen in the star. The spectrum\r\nwas carefully studied during the spring and summer by Pickering,\r\nLockyer, Huggins, Vogel, and others. On June 25 Pickering reported that\r\nthe spectrum was slowly changing into that of a gaseous nebula. In\r\nAugust and September 1901 the nebular spectrum became more apparent.\r\n\r\nIn August 1901 Wolf at Heidelberg discovered a faint trace of nebula\r\nnear the nova. On September 20 this nebula was photographed by _George\r\nRitchey_ at the Yerkes Observatory, and was seen to be of a spiral form.\r\nThis was confirmed by Perrine, who also found, from plates taken in\r\nNovember, that the nebula was moving at the rate of eleven minutes of\r\narc a year. This extraordinary velocity was exceedingly puzzling to\r\nastronomers, and at length Kapteyn suggested that the nebula shone only\r\nby reflected light from the new star, and that the apparent motion was\r\nan illusion caused by the flare of the explosion travelling out from the\r\nnova.\r\n\r\nOn March 16, 1903, _Herbert Hall Turner_ (born 1861), Professor of\r\nAstronomy at Oxford, discovered a new star of the seventh magnitude in\r\nthe constellation Gemini, from an examination of photographic plates.\r\nPhotographs taken at Harvard showed that on March 1 it must have been\r\nfainter than the twelfth magnitude, while five days later it was of the\r\nfifth. In August 1903 Pickering found its spectrum nebular. In August\r\n1905 another small nova was found by Mrs Fleming on the Harvard\r\nphotographs, situated in Aquila.\r\n\r\nMany theories have been advanced to account for temporary stars.\r\nFlammarion has shown that a body surrounded by a hydrogen atmosphere, on\r\ngrazing a dark body enveloped in oxygen, would produce a tremendous\r\nexplosion. In 1892 Huggins suggested that the outburst of Nova Aurigæ\r\nwas due to the near approach of two bodies with large velocities,\r\ndisturbances of a tidal nature resulting and producing enormous\r\noutbursts. Vogel suggested that the new star was due to the encounter of\r\na dark star with a worn-out system of planets; while Lockyer believes\r\nall new stars to be due to the collision of swarms of meteors. Perhaps\r\nthe most probable theory is that of Seeliger, which attributes these\r\noutbursts to the movement of a dark body through nebulous matter, which\r\nis extensively diffused throughout space. This theory explains the\r\nchanges in the spectra as well as the revivals of brightness which\r\ncharacterised Nova Aurigæ and the fluctuations of Nova Persei. In a\r\npaper read to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in November 1904, the\r\nGerman astronomer, _Jacobus Halm_, of the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh,\r\nextended and developed Seeliger’s theory, showing also that the\r\nnecessary consequence of such an encounter as the theory assumes is the\r\nformation of an atmosphere of incandescent gases, followed by that of a\r\nrevolving ring of nebulous matter. In the hands of Halm, therefore,\r\nSeeliger’s theory leads to the nebular hypothesis as advanced by Laplace\r\nand Herschel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n                      STELLAR SYSTEMS AND NEBULÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of double stars, commenced by Herschel, was taken up after his\r\ndeath by several of the foremost astronomers, and has since been pursued\r\nby quite a number of observers and computers. Herschel’s immediate\r\nsuccessor in the study of double stars was his son, who ranks only\r\nsecond to his father as a student of stellar systems. Born at Slough on\r\nMarch 7, 1792, John Frederick William Herschel passed his childhood\r\n“within the shadow of the great telescope.” Although his early life was\r\nspent with his father and aunt, astronomy does not appear to have taken\r\nup his attention as a boy. Chemistry, however, always interested him,\r\nand, as his aunt recorded, even while a child he was fond of making\r\nexperiments. He was educated at Hitcham, and afterwards at Eton. He was\r\ndelicate, however, so his mother removed him from school, and he was\r\ntrained at Slough by Mr Rogers, a Scottish mathematician. At the age of\r\nseventeen Herschel entered the University of Cambridge, and Caroline\r\nHerschel, who was exceedingly proud of him, recorded in her memoirs that\r\nhe gained all the first prizes without exception. He left the University\r\nin 1813.\r\n\r\nJohn Herschel did not turn his attention to astronomy until he had\r\nattained the age of twenty-four. In a letter to a friend, September 10,\r\n1816, he said, “I am going, under my father’s directions, to take up\r\nstar-gazing.” It was only reverence for his father that made him turn to\r\nastronomy, and he gave up the science he loved most—chemistry. But his\r\nunselfishness received its reward. In 1820 John Herschel constructed his\r\nfirst reflector under his father’s guidance. Four years previously he\r\nhad begun to observe double stars, which had been for long studied by\r\nhis father, who discovered their revolutions. These observations were\r\ncontinued from 1821 to 1823 at the Observatory of Sir _James South_\r\n(1786-1867). John Herschel and South measured 380 of the elder\r\nHerschel’s double stars. These investigations gained for Herschel and\r\nSouth the Lalande Prize of the French Academy and the Gold Medal of the\r\nRoyal Astronomical Society.\r\n\r\nWhen his mother died Sir John Herschel decided to sail to the Cape of\r\nGood Hope to make an investigation of the stars of the southern\r\nhemisphere, which until then had been much neglected. He was offered a\r\nfree passage in a ship of war, but declined. In November 1833 he left\r\nEngland, taking with him his great telescopes. In two months he arrived\r\nat Cape Town, and erected his astronomical instruments at Feldhausen, a\r\nshort distance off. In October 1835 he informed his aunt that he had\r\nalmost completed his survey of the southern hemisphere. During his\r\n“sweeps” of the heavens he discovered 1202 double stars, and 1708 nebulæ\r\nand star-clusters. In 1838 he returned to England, and devoted the\r\nremainder of his life to the publication of his results, as well as to\r\nother branches of science. He died at Collingwood, in Kent, on May 11,\r\n1871, at the age of seventy-nine.\r\n\r\nJohn Herschel’s favourite objects of study were double stars, of which\r\nhe discovered 3347 in the northern hemisphere, and 1202 in the southern.\r\nHe also computed several stellar orbits; but the first calculation of a\r\nstellar orbit was made by the French astronomer _Felix Savary_\r\n(1797-1841), who computed the orbit of ξ Ursæ Majoris, and found the\r\nperiod to be about sixty years. Contemporary with John Herschel was his\r\ngreat rival in double-star astronomy, Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve.\r\nBorn at Altona in 1793, Struve took his degree in 1811 at the Russian\r\nUniversity of Dorpat. In 1813 he became director of the Dorpat\r\nObservatory, and was in 1839 promoted to Pulkowa, as director of the\r\ngreat Observatory there, remaining at its head until within three years\r\nof his death, on November 23, 1864. Struve’s first recorded observation\r\nwas on the double star Castor. In 1819 he commenced to measure the\r\nposition-angles of double stars, of which he published a catalogue of\r\n795. In 1825 he commenced a review of the heavens down to fifteen\r\ndegrees south, and thus discovered 2200 previously unknown objects. The\r\nresults were published in Struve’s ‘Mensuræ Merometricæ,’ which appeared\r\nin 1836, giving the places, distances, colours, position-angles, and\r\nrelative brilliance of 3112 double and multiple stars.\r\n\r\nStruve’s successor in this branch of astronomy was his son, Otto Wilhelm\r\nvon Struve, born in 1819 at Dorpat, who became in 1837 assistant to his\r\nfather, and in 1861 succeeded him as director of the Pulkowa\r\nObservatory. In 1890 he retired from this post, settling in Germany, at\r\nCarlsruhe, where, on April 14, 1905, he died in his eighty-sixth year.\r\nOtto Struve detected 500 double stars, among them γ Andromedæ,\r\ndiscovered in 1842, and δ Equulei, discovered in 1852, within a period\r\nof between five and eleven years.\r\n\r\nVarious other astronomers have devoted themselves to the observation of\r\ndouble stars, among them _Ercole Dembowski_ (1815-1881), of Milan; _Karl\r\nHermann Struve_ (born 1854), son of Otto Struve; _William Doberck_ (born\r\n1845); _William J. Hussey_ (born 1864), now director of the Detroit\r\nObservatory; Camille Flammarion; N. C. Dunér; G. V. Schiaparelli;\r\n_Thomas Jefferson Jackson See_ (born 1866). But the greatest living\r\n_discoverer_ is _Sherburne Wesley Burnham_ (born 1838), now employed at\r\nthe Yerkes Observatory, in Wisconsin. Born in 1838 at Thetford, Vermont,\r\nhe commenced his career as a shorthand reporter, studying astronomy in\r\nhis leisure hours. With a small 6-inch refractor, mounted in a home-made\r\nobservatory, Burnham commenced in 1871 his discoveries of double stars,\r\nwhich soon attracted the attention of noted astronomers, who permitted\r\nhim to use larger telescopes, with which he continued his researches.\r\nHis first official appointment was in 1888, when he became chief\r\nassistant at the Lick Observatory, which position he resigned in 1892.\r\nSome years later he became astronomer in the Yerkes Observatory.\r\nAltogether he has discovered 1308 double stars, with telescopes ranging\r\nfrom a 6-inch refractor to the gigantic 40-inch of the Yerkes\r\nObservatory.\r\n\r\nThe computation of double-star orbits has been undertaken by various\r\nastronomers, among them Mädler, Klinkerfues, Dunér, Flammarion,\r\nSeeliger, See, Gore, Burnham, _Robert Grant Aitken_ (born 1864) of the\r\nLick Observatory, and _Giovanni Celoria_ (born 1842), who was, from 1866\r\nto 1900, assistant in the Brera Observatory of Milan, and since 1900\r\ndirector of that institution. On June 9, 1890, Gore presented to the\r\nRoyal Irish Academy a catalogue of computed binaries containing\r\nreference to fifty-nine stars.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 Bessel discovered a remarkable irregularity in the proper motion\r\nof Sirius. He ascribed this to the gravitational influence of some\r\nobscure body, probably a large satellite. In 1857 Peters calculated an\r\norbit for the supposed satellite with a period of 50 years. In 1861 an\r\norbit was computed by _Truman Henry Safford_ (1836-1901), which\r\nindicated the position of the satellite. Close to this position it was\r\naccidentally discovered by _Alvan Clark_ (1832-1897), the famous\r\nAmerican optician. The period of the star seems to be about 50 years. In\r\n1844 Bessel noticed irregularities in the proper motion of Procyon, and\r\nput forward the idea of a disturbing satellite, as in the case of\r\nSirius. This was confirmed by Mädler, and in 1874 an orbit was computed\r\nby Auwers, who found a period of 40 years. In 1896 the satellite was\r\nfound by Schaeberle with the 36-inch refractor of the Lick Observatory.\r\nA period of 40 years was found by See, in agreement with the\r\nhypothetical orbit.\r\n\r\nIn putting forward these theories as to invisible stellar satellites,\r\nBessel remarked that “light is no real property of mass,” and that the\r\nexistence of countless visible stars is nothing against the existence of\r\ncountless invisible and dark ones. In this he laid the foundation of the\r\nbranch of science termed by Mädler the “Astronomy of the invisible.” In\r\nrecent years the astronomy of the invisible has become a recognised\r\nbranch of astronomical research, through the application and\r\ninterpretation of Doppler’s principle in spectroscopic observations. In\r\nthe course of photographing the stellar spectra for the Draper\r\nCatalogue, E. C. Pickering photographed the spectrum of Mizar (ζ Ursæ\r\nMajoris) in 1887 and again in 1889. On some of these photographs the\r\nline K was seen double, while on others it was seen under its normal\r\naspect. This doubling of the lines indicated that the star which we see\r\nas single is in reality composed of two bodies in revolution round their\r\ncentre of gravity, so close together that even the largest telescopes\r\ncannot divide them. Pickering assigned a period of 104 days, but in 1901\r\nVogel diminished this to 20 days. In the same year the star β Aurigæ was\r\nsimilarly found to be double; and in 1890 Vogel, from photographs taken\r\nat Potsdam, independently inaugurated the discovery of spectroscopic\r\nbinaries. In the spectrum of Spica he discovered the spectral lines to\r\nbe, not doubled, but periodically displaced, indicating the existence of\r\na dark or nearly dark companion, both stars revolving round their centre\r\nof gravity. Spica was seen to belong to the same class as Algol, only\r\nthat in the case of Algol the plane of the satellite’s orbit passes\r\nthrough the Earth and eclipses the star, while in the case of Spica the\r\norbit is inclined, and the star is constant in light.\r\n\r\nThe line of research commenced by Vogel and Pickering was soon followed\r\nup by these investigators, as well as by Bélopolsky at Pulkowa, Campbell\r\nat the Lick Observatory, Slipher at the Lowell Observatory, and by\r\n_Edwin Brant Frost_ (born 1866), now director of the Yerkes Observatory,\r\nand his assistant, _Walter Adams_. In 1894 Bélopolsky discovered the\r\nduplicity of several variable stars, and in 1896 that of Castor, in\r\nGemini. Late in 1896 Campbell undertook a systematic investigation of\r\nradial motions, and has since discovered about sixty spectroscopic\r\nbinaries,—among them, in 1899, the Pole Star, and in 1900 Capella. The\r\nlatter discovery was made independently by _Hugh Frank Newall_ (born\r\n1857) at Cambridge, in England. It was found by Campbell that the\r\nrevolution of the stars round their centre of gravity is performed in\r\n104 days; and it soon became apparent that, owing to the large size of\r\nthe orbit, the duplicity of Capella might be observed telescopically. At\r\nGreenwich the star was seen to be elongated, but at the Lick Observatory\r\nit was seen persistently single.\r\n\r\nCampbell finds that of 285 stars observed by him, more than one in nine\r\nis a spectroscopic binary. He concludes that at least one star in five\r\nor six will be found to be spectroscopically double, and considers that\r\n“the proven existence of so large a number of stellar systems, differing\r\nso widely in structure from the Solar System, gives rise to a suspicion\r\nat least that our system is not of the prevailing type of stellar\r\nsystems.”\r\n\r\nThe study of triple and multiple stars is of deep interest, but the\r\norbits of these objects cannot be said to be fully investigated by any\r\nmeans. The first application of the problem of three bodies to stellar\r\nastronomy was made by Seeliger in 1889. His researches, relating to the\r\nfamous star, ζ Cancri, disclosed the existence of three stars revolving\r\nround a dark body, apparently the most massive in the system. The system\r\nof ζ Cancri, at least, seems to be modelled on the Ptolemaic design.\r\n\r\nIn the study of star-clusters and nebulæ, as in the investigation of\r\ndouble stars, Herschel’s successor was his son. His observations, both\r\nin England and at the Cape of Good Hope, resulted in a large number of\r\nnew discoveries, and the results of his studies in this direction were\r\npublished in 1864 in his catalogue of all known clusters and nebulæ,\r\namounting to 5079. This catalogue was enlarged and revised in 1888 by\r\n_John Louis Emil Dreyer_ (born 1852), a Danish astronomer, but director\r\nof the Observatory at Armagh, in Ireland; and the same observer\r\npublished from 1888 to 1894 a supplementary list, bringing the number of\r\nknown clusters and nebulæ to about 10,000.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of his career, John Herschel held firmly to the views\r\nof his father of the difference between star-clusters and nebulæ,\r\nconsidering the latter to be composed of “shining fluid.” But he fell\r\noff from this view with the resolution into stars of many irresolvable\r\nnebulæ. In 1845 _William Parsons_, third _Earl of Rosse_ (1800-1867),\r\nerected at Birr Castle, in Ireland, his great 6-foot reflector, which\r\nstill surpasses all other telescopes in point of size. With this\r\ninstrument Lord Rosse believed himself to have resolved the Crab nebula\r\nin Taurus and the Nebula in Orion, which was also said to have been\r\nresolved by Bond with the 15-inch refractor at Harvard; and in 1854\r\nOlmsted declared the “resolution” of these nebulæ to be the signal for\r\nthe renunciation of Herschel’s nebular theory. Most astronomers fell in\r\nwith the view that all the nebulæ were distant clusters, which would\r\neventually be resolved into stars, although it is only right to state\r\nthat the Scottish astronomer, _John Pringle Nichol_ (1804-1859), and\r\nsome other investigators, held to the theory of Herschel.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the great problem was in 1864, when on August 29 of that\r\nyear Huggins turned his spectroscope on a bright planetary nebula in\r\nDraco. To his amazement the spectrum was one of bright lines, proving\r\nconclusively that the nebula was not a star-cluster, but a mass of\r\nglowing gas,—hydrogen, and some other unknown substance, now named\r\n“nebulium.” By 1868 Huggins had observed the spectra of seventy nebulæ.\r\nOf these one-third proved to be gaseous, among them the great Orion\r\nnebula which Lord Rosse was believed to have resolved into stars. In the\r\nspectrum of the latter, the “chief nebular line” was at first ascribed\r\nby Huggins to nitrogen, but this was a mistake. Later, it was believed\r\nby Lockyer to coincide with the fluting of magnesium, but this was\r\ndisproved by Huggins in 1889-90, and by Keeler in 1890-91. The great\r\nnebula in Andromeda and the great spiral in Canes Venatici were found by\r\nHuggins to display a continuous spectrum, and a similar discovery was\r\nmade in regard to the cluster M 13 in Hercules, and other star-clusters.\r\nIn the case of the nebulæ, it is not believed that the continuous\r\nspectrum is due to the existence of sun-like bodies, as a gas under\r\npressure would give a continuous spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe Orion nebula has been more thoroughly studied than any other object\r\nof its class. The application of photography to spectroscopy has done\r\nmuch to further the study of the lines in the nebular spectrum. In 1886\r\nCopeland detected in the spectrum of the Orion nebula the yellow ray of\r\nhelium. On February 13, 1890, Scheiner announced an important discovery,\r\nnamely, the possession by both the nebula and the stars in Orion—with\r\nthe exception of Betelgeux—of a line, which appeared bright in the\r\nnebular spectra and dark in the stellar. This line was identified by\r\nVogel, Lockyer, and others with that of helium.\r\n\r\nNebular photography was inaugurated in 1880 by Draper, who obtained a\r\nremarkably good representation of the Orion nebula in that year. His\r\nwork in this direction, cut short by his death in 1882, was taken up by\r\nJanssen at Meudon, and by Common in England, who obtained, in 1883,\r\nseveral excellent photographs. Later photographs have shown the Orion\r\nnebula to be much more extended than visual observations would lead one\r\nto expect. A photograph secured in 1890 by W. H. Pickering revealed the\r\nnebulous matter in Orion in its true form, that of a gigantic spiral,\r\nstarting from near Bellatrix, sweeping past κ Orionis and Rigel to η,\r\nand joining with the great nebula surrounding θ; the entire\r\nconstellation being thus shown to be enwrapped in nebulous haze.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 nebular photography was commenced by _Isaac Roberts_\r\n(1829-1904), the English amateur astronomer, who secured admirable\r\nrepresentations of clusters and nebulæ. He published, in 1893 and 1900,\r\ntwo volumes of collected photographs of clusters and nebulæ. This\r\nmonumental work was thus referred to by Dr _William James Lockyer_: “Dr\r\nRoberts has not only nobly enriched astronomical science, but has raised\r\na monument to himself which will last as long as astronomy has any\r\ninterest for mankind.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable revelation made by photography in this\r\nbranch of research has been the discovery of the nebulæ in the Pleiades.\r\nIn 1859 Tempel observed at Florence an elliptical nebula south of the\r\nstar Merope. On November 16, 1885, the brothers Henry obtained at Paris\r\na photograph of the Pleiades, revealing the existence of a small spiral\r\nnebula. This was confirmed by visual observations, and particularly by\r\nthe photographs of Roberts, which also showed the entire cluster to be\r\nnebulous, and that “the nebulosity extends in streamers and fleecy\r\nmasses, till it seems almost to fill the spaces between the stars, and\r\nto extend far beyond them.” In 1888 a further advance was made by the\r\nbrothers Henry, who found seven stars to be strung on a nebulous streak.\r\n\r\nSince 1890 nebular photography has been pursued by Max Wolf in Germany,\r\nand by E. E. Barnard and J. E. Keeler in America. Wolf’s photographs of\r\nthe constellation Cygnus brought out the close connection between the\r\nstars and the extensively diffused nebulosities discovered by him. In\r\n1901 Wolf discovered a “nebelhaufen” or cluster of nebulæ, and in 1902\r\npublished a catalogue of 1528 nebulæ round the pole of the Galaxy,\r\nshowing them to be systematically distributed. Keeler made his memorable\r\nobservations with the great 36-inch reflecting telescope, which was\r\nconstructed in England many years ago by Common. It afterwards passed\r\ninto the hands of Mr Crossley of Halifax, who presented it to the Lick\r\nObservatory. With this great instrument Keeler commenced to take\r\nphotographs of the heavens. On one occasion he photographed a well-known\r\nnebula, and on developing the plate was surprised to find seven new\r\nnebulæ besides that which he had photographed. On another occasion he\r\nexposed a plate to a nebula in Pegasus. He was amazed to find altogether\r\ntwenty-one nebulæ included in the photograph. To give another instance,\r\na plate directed to the constellation Andromeda contained no fewer than\r\nthirty-two nebulous objects. This has given an enormous extension to our\r\nknowledge of the nebulæ. But even this is not all. Keeler found on his\r\nplates numerous points of light which seem to be also nebulæ, either too\r\nsmall or too remote to appear as such. Apparently, however, they are not\r\nstars. Keeler’s work convinced him that, on a modest estimate, there\r\nmust be at least _one hundred and twenty thousand_ new nebulæ within\r\nreach of the Crossley reflector. Half of these, he announced, were\r\nprobably spiral. An idea of the vast importance of Keeler’s work may be\r\ngained if we reflect that the observations of all the earlier\r\nastronomers resulted in the discovery of six thousand nebulæ. The\r\ninvestigations of Keeler, in all probability, were the means of adding\r\n120,000 more.\r\n\r\nMany observations have been made on nebulæ, for the purpose of\r\nascertaining their proper motions—but without success. Measurements were\r\nmade by D’Arrest in 1857 and by Burnham in 1891, but none of these\r\nrevealed any motion of the nebulæ across the line of sight. Even the new\r\nspectroscopic method of determining motions in the line of sight, in the\r\nhands of Huggins, failed in the case of the nebulæ. With the great Lick\r\nrefractor at his disposal, Keeler attacked the subject in 1890, and\r\nmeasured the radial velocities of ten nebulæ. He found that the\r\nwell-known planetary nebula in Draco was moving towards the Solar System\r\nat the rate of 40 miles a second; for the Orion nebula he found a motion\r\nof recession of 11 miles a second; but probably this belongs chiefly to\r\nthe movement of the Solar System in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Keeler did not live to carry on his investigations in\r\nnebular astronomy. His early death brought to an abrupt end these\r\nfruitful investigations. Appointed director of the Lick Observatory in\r\n1898, he died suddenly at San Francisco on August 12, 1900, at the early\r\nage of forty-two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n        STELLAR DISTRIBUTION AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Herschel there was little done in the direction of\r\nfurthering our knowledge of stellar distribution, or the construction of\r\nthe heavens. Here, as elsewhere, Herschel’s immediate successor was his\r\nson, whose star-gauges, both in England and in South Africa, were a\r\nworthy sequel to those of his father; but John Herschel, in his books on\r\nastronomy, reproduced his father’s disc-theory, unaware that the elder\r\nHerschel had himself abandoned it. The work of the younger Herschel was\r\nentirely supplementary to that of his father.\r\n\r\nTo Wilhelm Struve belongs the credit of showing the disc-theory to be\r\nuntenable, and of demonstrating that Herschel had abandoned it. This he\r\nwas able to do after a perusal of Herschel’s papers, presented to him by\r\nJohn Herschel. Having demonstrated this, he undertook a series of\r\ninvestigations which resulted in his famous theory of the Universe. This\r\nwas published in his work ‘Études d’Astronomie Stellaire,’ which was\r\npublished in 1847. His researches were based on the star-catalogues of\r\nBessel, Piazzi, and others; and dealing with 52,199 stars, he discussed\r\nthe number of stars in each zone of Right Ascension. He found, in the\r\nwords of Mr Gore, “that the numbers increase from hour i to hour vi,\r\nwhere they attain a maximum. They then diminish to a minimum at hour\r\nxiii, and rise to another but smaller maximum at hour xviii, again\r\ndecreasing to a second minimum at hour xxii. As the hours vi and xviii\r\nare those crossed by the Milky Way, the result is very significant.” He\r\nconcluded the Galaxy to be produced by a collection of\r\nirregularly-condensed clusters, the stars condensed in parallel planes.\r\nNext, he considered the Universe as perhaps infinitely extended in the\r\ndirection of the Galaxy, and accordingly he put forward the idea that\r\nthe light from the fainter and more distant stars was extinguished in\r\nits passage through the ether of space, which he regarded as imperfectly\r\ntransparent. The theory, as Struve propounded it, was disposed of by Sir\r\nJohn Herschel, who remarked that we were not permitted to believe that\r\nat one part of the sky our view was limited by extinction, while at\r\nanother a clear view right through the Galaxy could be had; and by\r\n_Robert Grant_ (1814-1892), director of the Glasgow Observatory, who\r\nshowed that, were the theory true, the Galaxy should present a uniform\r\nappearance throughout its course. On the whole, Struve’s theory was no\r\nimprovement on Herschel’s; for, as Encke pointed out, Struve’s theory\r\nwas built on five assumptions, all of which were questionable.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Struve’s investigation Mädler, at Dorpat, was engaged in\r\nan attempt to solve the question of the construction of the heavens by\r\nquite another method, that of stellar proper motion. He determined to\r\ninvestigate the subject of proper motion in order to discover the\r\ncentral body of the Milky Way. If such a centre existed, however, the\r\nmotions near it would be somewhat different from those in the Solar\r\nSystem. In our Solar System the planets nearest the Sun move swiftest,\r\nowing to the strength of the force of gravitation. In the Sidereal\r\nSystem, on the other hand, the movements at the centre, as Mädler\r\npointed out, would be slowest. As there would be no very large\r\npreponderating body, the mutual attractions of the different stars would\r\ncause the bodies at the boundaries of the Universe to move faster than\r\nthose at the centre, the central sun—the object of Mädler’s search—being\r\nin a state of rest relative to the Sidereal System. Mädler accordingly\r\nbegan to search the heavens for a region of sluggish proper motions.\r\n\r\nIn the constellation Taurus, Mädler noticed that the proper motions of\r\nthe stars were very slow. The idea occurred to him that the bright red\r\nstar Aldebaran might be the central sun, but its very large proper\r\nmotion was obviously against this inference. Star after star was now\r\nsubjected by Mädler to the most careful scrutiny. At length, after a\r\nlaborious investigation, he announced that the star which fulfilled the\r\nconditions of a central body was Alcyone, the brightest of the Pleiades,\r\na group possessed of no proper motion except that due to the sun’s drift\r\nin the opposite direction. In 1846 Mädler published his hypothesis in\r\nhis elaborate work, ‘The Central Sun.’ He announced that his\r\nobservations had led him to the conclusion that Alcyone occupied the\r\ncentre of gravity of the Sidereal System, and was the point round which\r\nthe stars of the Galaxy were all revolving. His profound imagination,\r\nhowever, did not stop here. This speculation led him to the sublime\r\nthought that the centre of the Universe was the Abode of the Creator. In\r\n1847 Struve rejected Mädler’s theory as “much too hazardous,” and this\r\nhas been the general opinion of astronomers. Mädler’s theory is now\r\nregarded as quite untenable.\r\n\r\nHerschel’s earlier idea that the nebulæ were external galaxies was long\r\nheld by the majority of astronomers, in preference to his later and more\r\nadvanced ideas. The supposed resolution of the nebulæ by Lord Rosse’s\r\ntelescope gave support to this external galaxy theory. It was clearly\r\nshown, however, by _William Whewell_ (1794-1866) in 1853, and by\r\n_Herbert Spencer_ (1820-1903) in 1858, that the systematic distribution\r\nof the nebulæ in regard to the stars precluded the possibility of their\r\nbeing external galaxies. This was confirmed by the spectroscopic\r\ndiscovery of the gaseous nature of some of the nebulæ, and by the later\r\nresearches of R. A. Proctor. Not only did Proctor make fresh\r\ndiscoveries, but it fell to him to clear away the erroneous ideas\r\nregarding the construction of the heavens, and to put the study on a new\r\nbasis. In 1870 Proctor plotted on a single chart all the stars, to the\r\nnumber of 324,198, contained in Argelander’s ‘Durchmusterung’ charts.\r\nThis work gave the death-blow to the “disc-theory.” In his own words,\r\n“In the very regions where the Herschelian gauges showed the minutest\r\ntelescopic stars to be most crowded, my chart of 324,198 stars shows the\r\nstars of the higher orders (down to the eleventh magnitude) to be so\r\ncrowded, that by their mere aggregation within the mass they show the\r\nMilky Way with all its streams and clusterings. It is utterly impossible\r\nthat excessively remote stars could seem to be clustered exactly where\r\nrelatively near stars were richly spread.”\r\n\r\nProctor showed also that in all probability the stars composing the\r\nnebulous light of the Galaxy are much smaller than the brighter stars,\r\nand not at such a great distance as their faintness would lead us to\r\nsuppose,—a conclusion confirmed by the work of Celoria. Proctor was not\r\nso fortunate in theorising as in direct investigation. He thought that\r\nthe Magellanic clouds were probably external galaxies; and further, he\r\nput forward the idea that the Milky Way is a spiral, the gaps and\r\ncoal-sacks being due to loops in the stream, but neither of these ideas\r\nhas found favour with astronomers. But the chief work accomplished by\r\nProctor was a revision of our knowledge of the Universe, which he thus\r\ndescribes: “Within one and the same region coexist stars of many orders\r\nof real magnitude, the greatest being thousands of times larger than the\r\nleast. All the nebulæ hitherto discovered, whether gaseous and stellar,\r\nirregular, planetary, ring-formed, or elliptic, exist within the limits\r\nof the Sidereal System.”\r\n\r\nProctor’s discovery of the excess of bright stars on the Galaxy was\r\nconfirmed by _Jean Charles Houzeau_ (1820-1888), director of the\r\nBrussels Observatory. Some time later J. E. Gore carefully examined the\r\npositions of all the brighter stars in the northern and southern\r\nhemisphere. Following this, he made an enumeration of the stars in the\r\natlas of Heis and in the charts constructed by Harding; the outcome of\r\nthe investigation being to show that stars of each individual magnitude\r\ntaken separately tend to aggregate on the Galaxy, the aggregation being\r\nnoticed even in first-magnitude stars. Gore further pointed out many\r\ncases of close connection between the lucid stars and the galactic\r\nlight. A similar investigation was undertaken by Schiaparelli in 1889.\r\nSchiaparelli, basing his work on the catalogue of Gould and the\r\nphotometric measures of Pickering, constructed a series of planispheres\r\nwhich demonstrated the crowding of the lucid stars towards the plane of\r\nthe Galaxy. These investigations were still further continued by Simon\r\nNewcomb, who demonstrated that “the darker regions of the Galaxy are\r\nonly slightly richer in stars visible to the naked eye than other parts\r\nof the heavens, while the bright areas are between 60 and 100 per cent\r\nricher than the dark areas.” The Dutch astronomer, _Charles Easton_,\r\nfinds a connection between the distribution of ninth-magnitude stars and\r\nthe luminous and obscure spots in the Galaxy.\r\n\r\nIt was noticed by Gould, from observations made at Cordova, that “a belt\r\nor stream of bright stars appears to girdle the heavens very nearly in a\r\ngreat circle which intersects the Milky Way.” According to Gould, the\r\nbelt includes Orion, Canis Major, Argo, Crux, Centaurus, Lupus, and\r\nScorpio in the southern hemisphere, and Taurus, Perseus, Cassiopeia,\r\nCepheus, Cygnus, and Lyra in the northern. This was interpreted by\r\nCeloria as indicating the existence of two galactic rings, but Gould\r\nconsidered the zone of bright stars to form with the Sun a subordinate\r\ncluster of about five hundred stars within the Galaxy.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most elaborate investigations on the structure of the\r\nUniverse have been those of Kapteyn, commenced in 1891. In that year he\r\ndemonstrated that stars are bluer and more easily photographed in the\r\nGalaxy than elsewhere, a discovery independently made by Gill at the\r\nCape, and Pickering at Harvard. In 1893 Kapteyn announced his\r\nconclusions, derived from a novel method of studying the distance of the\r\nstars from their proper motions. In order to reach a definite idea of\r\nthe distances of the stars, he made use of the component of the proper\r\nmotion, measured at right angles to a great circle of the sphere which\r\npasses through a given star and the apex of the solar motion. He found\r\nthat stars of the first spectral type have smaller proper motions than\r\nthose of the second, indicating that stars of the second type are on the\r\naverage nearer to the Solar System than those of the first, the near\r\nvicinity containing almost exclusively second-type stars. Kapteyn\r\nconcluded that the group of second-type stars formed one system, named\r\nthe solar cluster, which he considered to be roughly spherical in shape.\r\nIn 1902 he abandoned this idea, retaining, however, his opinions as to\r\nthe relative distances of the different types. That the second-type\r\nstars are nearer to the Sun than the first is, he remarked in a letter\r\nto the writer, incontrovertible.\r\n\r\nIn the investigation of the motions in, and extent of, the Universe, the\r\nname of Simon Newcomb stands out pre-eminently. Born in 1835 at Wallace,\r\nin Nova Scotia, he went to the States in 1853. In 1862 he received an\r\nappointment at Washington Observatory, and he retained an official\r\nposition until 1897. Throughout his scientific career he has been\r\nspecially attracted by the question of the construction of the heavens,\r\nwhich he fully discussed in his book on ‘The Stars’ in 1901. Newcomb’s\r\ninvestigations have shown that some of the stars are not permanent\r\nmembers of the Sidereal System, among them the swiftly-moving 1830\r\nGroombridge. He has shown that the Stellar Universe does not possess\r\nthat form of stability which is seen in the Solar System. Newcomb\r\nconsiders the Universe to be limited in extent, as opposed to the\r\nopinions of Struve and others, who believed it to be infinite. He has\r\nbrought clearly before his readers a calculation, based on the known law\r\nthat there are three times as many stars of any given magnitude as of\r\nthat immediately brighter, the increase of number compensating for the\r\ndecrease of brilliance. Were the Universe infinitely extended, the whole\r\nheavens would shine with the brilliance of the Sun. Newcomb, therefore,\r\nconcludes that “that collection of stars which we call the Universe is\r\nlimited in extent.”\r\n\r\nPositive evidence that this is the case was obtained by Giovanni\r\nCeloria, now director of the Milan Observatory, in the course of a\r\nseries of star-gauges at the north galactic pole. Using a small\r\nrefractor, showing stars barely to the eleventh magnitude, he found he\r\ncould see exactly the same number of stars as Herschel’s large\r\nreflector, indicating that increase of optical power will not increase\r\nthe number of stars visible in that direction. Celoria’s observation can\r\nonly be explained on the assumption that the Universe is limited in\r\nextent, as otherwise Herschel’s telescope should have shown more stars\r\nthan Celoria’s, even granting an extinction of light,—a theory which\r\nNewcomb, Schiaparelli, and others have shown to be quite untenable. That\r\nthe Universe is limited in extent is about all that is known for\r\ncertain, although even this has been called in question, notably by E.\r\nW. Maunder and H. H. Turner. The problem of the construction of the\r\nheavens is by no means solved, although several more or less probable\r\ntheories have been advanced.\r\n\r\nA series of investigations on stellar distribution, from 1884 to 1898,\r\nled Hugo Seeliger, director of the Munich Observatory, to some\r\nremarkable deductions. He believes the Universe to be flattened at the\r\ngalactic poles. The Galaxy is the zone of stellar condensation, and he\r\nconcludes the distance of the Solar System from the inner border of the\r\nzone to be 500 times the distance of Sirius, while the external border\r\nis 1100 times that distance. The Universe is finite in extent, its\r\nlimits being about 9000 light years from the Solar System. In Seeliger’s\r\nopinion the extinction of light may come into play beyond our Universe,\r\nand prevent us seeing other collections of stars.\r\n\r\nThe question of external universes is purely a hypothetical one,\r\nalthough there is undoubtedly much to be said in its favour. These\r\nuniverses have never been seen, and we can only speculate as to their\r\nexistence. The last word on the subject is by Gore, in 1893, in his\r\nelaborate work, ‘The Visible Universe.’ He regards the Solar System as a\r\nsystem of the first order, and the Galaxy and its fellow-universes of\r\nthe second. He makes a calculation of the possible distance of an\r\nexternal universe of his second order. He assumes the distance of the\r\nnearest universe from our Galaxy as proportional to that separating the\r\nSun from α Centauri, and reaches the amazing conclusion that the\r\ndistance of the nearest Galaxy is no less than\r\n520,149,600,000,000,000,000 miles,—a distance which light, with its\r\ninconceivable velocity of 186,000 miles a second, would take almost\r\nninety millions of years to traverse.\r\n\r\nThese calculations absolutely overwhelm the mind, which is unable to\r\ncomprehend such vast distances. Our universe is indeed, as Flammarion\r\nexpresses it, a point in the infinite. The calculations of J. E. Gore\r\nrepresent our highest scientific conception of the universe. He sums up\r\nhis investigations with the following words: “Although we must consider\r\nthe number of _visible_ stars as strictly finite, the numbers of stars\r\nand systems really existing, but invisible to us, may be practically\r\ninfinite. Could we speed our flight through space on angel wings beyond\r\nthe confines of our limited universe to a distance so great that the\r\ninterval which separates us from the remotest fixed star might be\r\nconsidered as merely a step on our celestial journey, what further\r\ncreations might not then be revealed to our wondering vision? Systems of\r\na higher order might there be unfolded to our view, compared with which\r\nthe whole of our visible heavens might appear like a grain of sand on\r\nthe ocean shore,—systems perhaps stretching out to infinity before us,\r\nand reaching at last the glorious ‘mansions’ of the Almighty, the Throne\r\nof the Eternal.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n                          CELESTIAL EVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second chapter we outlined the nebular hypothesis as propounded\r\nby Herschel. Some time earlier the French mathematician, Laplace, had\r\nput forward his theory of the evolution of the Solar System. _Pierre\r\nSimon Laplace_ was born at Beaumont-en-Auge, near Honfleur, in 1749, and\r\nwas educated in the Military School of his native town. In 1767 he\r\nbecame Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Beaumont, and some years\r\nlater at the Military School in Paris, which position he retained for\r\nmany years. Member of the Institute and Minister of the Interior under\r\nNapoleon, he was created a Marquis by Louis XVIII., and died at Arcuile\r\non March 5, 1827.\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter of his popular work, the ‘Système du Monde,’ Laplace\r\nput forward his nebular theory “with that distrust which everything\r\nought to inspire that is not the result of observation or calculation.”\r\nLaplace noticed that in the Solar System all the planets revolved round\r\nthe Sun in the same direction, from west to east, and that the\r\nsatellites of the planets obeyed the same law. He also observed that the\r\nSun, Moon, and planets rotated on their axes in the same direction as\r\nthey revolved round the Sun; also that the planets moved round the Sun,\r\nand the satellites round their primaries, in almost the same plane as\r\nthe Earth’s orbit, the plane of the ecliptic. It was evident that these\r\nremarkable congruities were not the result of chance, and accordingly\r\nLaplace expressed his belief that the Solar System originated from a\r\ngreat nebula, which in condensing detached various rings in the process\r\nof rotation. These rings condensed into the various planets and their\r\nsatellites.\r\n\r\nLaplace’s theory was powerfully supported by Herschel’s observations of\r\nthe various nebulæ in the heavens. But, with the supposed resolution of\r\nthe various nebulæ after the erection of the Rosse reflector in 1845,\r\nthe evidence in favour of the nebular theory seemed to be greatly\r\nreduced. In 1864, however, the discovery of the gaseous nebulæ, by means\r\nof the spectroscope, gave further support to the theory. Powerful aid\r\nwas lent to the nebular hypothesis by the famous German physicist,\r\n_Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz_ (1821-1894), in 1854, in his\r\ntheory of the maintenance of the Sun’s heat. Many theories had been\r\nalready advanced to account for this. After the discovery of the\r\nconservation of energy, _Julius Robert Mayer_, one of the discoverers,\r\nput forward the theory that the Solar heat was sustained by the inflow\r\nof meteorites from space, and this idea was developed in 1854 by Sir\r\n_William Thomson_, now _Lord Kelvin_ (born 1824), but it was soon\r\napparent that the supply of meteors required to sustain the Solar heat\r\nwas such as would have increased the mass of the Sun very considerably.\r\nAccordingly the hypothesis was partially abandoned, and was succeeded by\r\nthat of Helmholtz, who pointed out that the radiation of the Sun’s heat\r\nwas the result of its contraction through cooling. The rate was then\r\nestimated at 380 feet yearly, or a second of arc in 6000 years. This\r\ntheory was at once generally accepted. It assumes the Sun to be still\r\ncontracting, and therefore, on going backwards in imagination, we reach\r\na period when the Sun must have been much larger than now, and, in fact,\r\nextended beyond the orbit of Neptune.\r\n\r\nSeveral objections to Laplace’s nebular theory were urged by various\r\ninvestigators. Among these was the retrograde motions of the satellites\r\nof Uranus and Neptune, and the extremely rapid revolution of the inner\r\nsatellite of Mars. Other objections were urged by Babinet, Kirkwood, and\r\nothers, and at length a sweeping reform of the nebular theory was\r\nproposed by Faye in 1884, in his work, ‘Sur l’Origine du Monde.’ Faye\r\nput forward the idea that all the planets interior to the orbit of\r\nUranus were formed inside the solar nebula, while Uranus and Neptune\r\ncame into existence after the development of the Sun was far advanced.\r\nBut the objections to Faye’s theory are formidable, and the hypothesis\r\nhas not been accepted.\r\n\r\nA popular exposition of the nebular theory was given in 1901 in Ball’s\r\nwork on ‘The Earth’s Beginning.’ He exhaustively discusses the whole\r\nquestion, and explains the retrograde motion of the satellites of Uranus\r\nand Neptune as due to the fact that the planes of the orbits of the\r\nsatellites will eventually be brought to coincide with the ecliptic.\r\nThese motions, says Ball, do not disprove the nebular theory. “They\r\nrather illustrate the fact that the great evolution which has wrought\r\nthe Solar System into its present form has not finished its work: it is\r\nstill in progress.”\r\n\r\nThe theory that the Sun’s heat was maintained by meteors, was extended\r\nby Proctor in 1870 to explain the growth of the planets through meteoric\r\naggregation as well as nebular condensation. Certainly the theory, as\r\ndeveloped by Proctor, accounted fairly well for the various features of\r\nthe Solar System; but the highest development of the meteoritic theory\r\nis due to Lockyer, who published his views in 1890, in his work, ‘The\r\nMeteoritic Hypothesis.’ Lockyer claims that his views are merely\r\nextensions of Schiaparelli’s ideas regarding the concentration of\r\ncelestial matter. He considered the chief nebular line to be identical\r\nwith the remnant of the magnesium fluting, which is conspicuous in\r\ncometic and meteoric spectra; but Huggins and Keeler, with more powerful\r\ninstruments, disproved the supposed coincidence. Lockyer considers that\r\n“all self-luminous bodies in the celestial space are composed either of\r\nswarms of meteorites or of masses of meteoric vapour produced by heat.\r\nThe heat is brought about by the condensation of meteor swarms, due to\r\ngravity, the vapour being finally condensed into a solid globe.”\r\n\r\nLockyer divided the stars into seven groups, according to temperature,\r\nthe order of evolution being from red stars through a division of\r\nsecond-type stars to Sirian stars, regarded as the hottest stars;\r\nthrough a second division of solar stars to fourth-type stars. In fact,\r\nthe theory aspires to give a complete explanation of all celestial\r\nphenomena, from meteors to nebulæ. Newcomb, however, considers that the\r\nobjections to the theory are insuperable, and his opinion is shared by\r\nthe majority of astronomers, many of whom, however, consider that there\r\nare elements of truth in the theory; but Lockyer undoubtedly carried his\r\nideas to an extravagant extent.\r\n\r\nLockyer’s evolutionary order of the stars is not supported by Vogel.\r\nZöllner suggested in 1865 that yellow and red stars are simply white\r\nstars in a further stage of cooling; but Angström showed that\r\natmospheric composition is a safer criterion of age than colour. Vogel’s\r\nclassification, first published in 1874, and further developed in 1895,\r\nis from the standpoint of evolution. He considers Orion stars and Sirian\r\nstars to be the youngest orbs. Solar stars are considered by Vogel to\r\nhave wasted much of their store of radiation, and red stars are viewed\r\nas “effete suns, hastening rapidly down the road to final extinction.”\r\nHe considers stars of Secchi’s fourth type to be also dying suns, both\r\ntypes representing alternative roads for stars of the Solar type in\r\ntheir decline into dark stars. This view is supported by Dunér, and is\r\ndistinctly confirmed by Hale’s observations with the Yerkes telescope.\r\nVogel’s views, in fact, are generally accepted among astronomers. The\r\nnebular theory, modified by subsequent research, seems destined to hold\r\nits own against all attacks.\r\n\r\nDistinctly supplementary to the nebular theory are the remarkable\r\nresearches, commenced in 1879, by Sir _George Howard Darwin_ (born\r\n1845), son of Charles Darwin the great biologist. George Howard Darwin\r\nwas born in 1845, at Downe in Kent, was educated at Cambridge, and\r\nstudied for the law; but in 1873 he returned to Cambridge, where he\r\nbecame Plumian Professor of Astronomy in 1883. In 1879 he communicated\r\nto the Royal Society the first of his papers on tidal friction, which\r\nwere summed up in his book on ‘The Tides,’ published in 1898. He finds\r\nthat the tides act upon the Earth as a brake does upon a machine,—they\r\ntend to retard its rotation. Consequently, the day is growing longer,\r\nthe Moon’s orbit is becoming enlarged, and its period of revolution is\r\nbeing lengthened.\r\n\r\nAt present the day is about twenty-four hours long, and the month about\r\ntwenty-seven days. The day, however, will be lengthened at a more rapid\r\nrate than the month, and in the remote future the day and month will\r\nboth last fifty-five of our present days. The Moon will revolve round\r\nthe Earth in the same period that the Earth rotates on its axis, and the\r\ntwo bodies will perform their circuit round the Sun as if united by a\r\nbar.\r\n\r\nNot only can we foresee the future of the Earth-Moon System, but we can\r\nalso read the past. According to Darwin’s theory, the Earth, in the\r\nremote past, was probably rotating on its axis in a very short period,\r\nbetween three and five hours. The Moon must then have been much nearer\r\nus than it is now, and was probably revolving round its primary in the\r\nsame period that the Earth took to rotate on its axis. The two globes,\r\nthen gaseous, must have been revolving almost in actual contact. Had the\r\nmonth been even a second shorter than the day, the Moon must inevitably\r\nhave fallen back on the Earth. As it was, the condition of affairs could\r\nnot endure. The condition of the Moon resembled that of an egg balanced\r\non its point. The Moon must either recede from the Earth or fall back\r\nupon it. The solar tide here interfered, and caused the Moon to recede\r\nfrom its primary until it reached its present distance of 239,000 miles.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Earth and Moon were almost in contact suggests that\r\nthey were probably in contact. In other words, the Moon originally\r\nformed part of the Earth, which, in consequence of its short-rotation\r\nperiod, and probably also owing to the interference of the solar tide,\r\nsplit into two portions, and the smaller of these now forms the Moon. It\r\nis likely that the matter now forming the Moon was detached from the\r\nEarth in separate particles. Just as the tides raised by the Moon tend\r\nto retard the motion of the Earth, so the Earth tides raised in the Moon\r\nhave already done their work. The Moon now rotates on its axis in the\r\nsame time as it revolves round the Earth. Part of the evolution of the\r\nEarth-Moon system is completed. Schiaparelli’s discovery that the\r\nrotation periods of both Venus and Mercury coincide with their times of\r\nrevolution is distinctly confirmatory of Darwin’s theory.\r\n\r\nIn his chapter on the “Evolution of Celestial Systems” in his book on\r\n‘The Tides,’ Darwin discusses the distribution of the satellites of the\r\nSolar System. He says of the evolution of a planet: “We have seen that\r\nrings should be shed from the central nucleus when the contraction of\r\nthe nebula has induced a certain degree of augmentation of rotation.\r\nNow, if the rotation were retarded by some external cause, the genesis\r\nof a ring might be retarded or entirely prevented.” He then remarks that\r\nprobably the formation of the Moon was retarded, and in the case of\r\nMercury and Venus, solar tidal friction prevented satellite formation.\r\nThis explains why Mercury and Venus have no satellites, the Earth only\r\none, Mars two, while the exterior planets have each several satellites.\r\n\r\nThe theory of tidal friction was extended in 1892 to the explanation of\r\nthe double stars by the American astronomer, See. See showed by\r\nmathematical calculation the effects of tidal friction in shaping the\r\neccentric orbits of the binary stars, the course of evolution being\r\ntraced from double stars, revolving almost in contact, which the\r\nspectroscope reveals, to the telescopic doubles. See’s researches have\r\ndone much to supplement those of Darwin, who considers that there are\r\ntwo types of cosmical evolution,—the Laplacian, and the “second” or\r\nlunar type.\r\n\r\nLowell, in his work on ‘The Solar System’ (1903), adds six congruities\r\nto those remarked by Laplace and his successors. These are, “All the\r\nsatellites turn the same face to their primaries (so far as we can\r\njudge); Mercury, and probably Venus, do the same to the Sun; one law\r\ngoverns position and size in the Solar System and in all the satellite\r\nsystems; orbital inclinations in the satellite systems increase with\r\ndistance from the primary; the outer planets show a greater tilt of axis\r\nto orbit-plane with increased distance from the Sun (so far as\r\ndetectable); the inner planets show a similar relation.”\r\n\r\nThe fate of the average solar star is sketched out by Vogel’s\r\nclassification, and by any evolutionary hypothesis which we may adopt.\r\nIn the words of Lowell: “Though we cannot as yet review with the mind’s\r\neye our past, we can, to an extent, foresee our future. We can with\r\nscientific confidence look forward to a time when each of the bodies\r\ncomposing our Solar System shall turn an unchanging face in perpetuity\r\nto the Sun. Each will then have reached the end of its evolution set in\r\nthe unchanging stare of death. Then the Sun itself will go out, becoming\r\na cold and lifeless mass; and the Solar System will circle unseen,\r\nghostlike, in space, awaiting only the resurrection of another cosmic\r\ncatastrophe.”\r\n\r\nAs to what this cosmic catastrophe will be, science gives no definite\r\nidea; nor can astronomers say with certainty whether the Universe will\r\ncome to an end by the extinction of its luminaries, or whether the suns\r\nand planets will be brought back to luminosity again; but the human mind\r\nshrinks from the idea of a dead Universe. At this point science has said\r\nits last word, and must give place to religion. In our day we may repeat\r\nwith deeper meaning the words of the Scottish astronomer, Thomas Dick:\r\n“Here imagination must drop its wing, since it can penetrate no further\r\ninto the dominions of Him who sits on the Throne of Immensity.\r\nOverwhelmed with a view of the magnificence of the Universe, and of the\r\nperfections of its Almighty Author, we can only fall prostrate in deep\r\nhumility and exclaim, ‘Great and marvellous are Thy works, Lord God\r\nAlmighty.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   A\r\n  Absolute parallax, 158.\r\n  Adams, J.
