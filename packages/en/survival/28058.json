This has been done in the\r\nbelief that the necessary information will thus be much more readily\r\nacquired by the busy gem merchant or jeweler than would have been the\r\ncase had the material been arranged in the usual systematic order. The\r\nlatter is of advantage for quick reference after the fundamentals of the\r\nsubject have been mastered. It is hoped, however, that the method of\r\npresentation used in this book will make easy the acquisition of a\r\nknowledge of gemology and that many who have been deterred from studying\r\nthe subject by a feeling that the difficulties due to their lack of\r\nscientific training were insurmountable, will find that they can learn\r\nall the science that is really necessary, as they proceed. To that end\r\nthe discussions have been given in as untechnical language as possible\r\nand homely illustrations have in many cases been provided.\r\n\r\nNearly every portion of the subject that a gem merchant needs to know\r\nhas been considered and there is provided for the interested public much\r\nmaterial which will enable them to be more intelligent purchasers of\r\ngem-set jewelry, as well as more appreciative lovers of Nature's\r\nwonderful mineral masterpieces.\r\n\r\n                                                                F. B. W.\r\n\r\n INDIANAPOLIS,\r\n   _December 26, 1916_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of the rapid increase in knowledge about precious stones on the\r\npart of the buying public, it has become necessary for the gem merchant\r\nand his clerks and salesmen to know at least as much about the subject\r\nof gemology as their better informed customers are likely to know.\r\n\r\nIn many recent articles in trade papers, attention has been called to\r\nthis need, and to the provision which Columbia University has made for a\r\ncourse in the study of gems. The action of the National Association of\r\nGoldsmiths of Great Britain in providing annual examinations in\r\ngemology, and in granting certificates and diplomas to those who\r\nsuccessfully pass the examinations, has also been reported, and it has\r\nbeen suggested that some such course should be pursued by jewelers'\r\nassociations in this country. The greatest difficulty in the way of such\r\nformal study among our jewelers and gem merchants is the lack of time\r\nfor attendance on formal courses, which must necessarily be given at\r\ndefinite times and in definite places.\r\n\r\nAs a diamond salesman was heard to say recently: \"The boss said he\r\nwanted me to take in that course at Columbia, but he didn't tell me how\r\nI was going to do it. Here I am a thousand miles from Columbia, and it\r\nwas only six weeks ago that he was telling me I ought to take that\r\ncourse. I can't stay around New York all the time.\" Similarly those\r\nwhose work keeps them in New York might object that their hours of\r\nemployment prevented attendance on day courses, and that distance from\r\nthe university and fatigue prevent attendance on night courses. The\r\ngreat mass of gem dealers in other cities must also be considered.\r\n\r\nIt will therefore be the endeavor of this book to provide guidance for\r\nthose who really want to make themselves more efficient in the gem\r\nbusiness, but who have felt that they needed something in the way of\r\nsuggestion regarding what to attempt, and how to go about it.\r\n\r\nStudy of the sort that will be suggested can be pursued in spare\r\nmoments, on street cars or elevated trains, in waiting rooms, or in\r\none's room at night. It will astonish many to find how much can be\r\naccomplished by consistently utilizing spare moments. Booker T.\r\nWashington is said to have written in such spare time practically all\r\nthat he has published.\r\n\r\nFor the practical study of the gems themselves, which is an absolutely\r\nessential part of the work, those actually engaged in the trade have\r\nbetter opportunities than any school could give and, except during rush\r\nseasons, there is plenty of time during business hours for such study.\r\nNo intelligent employer will begrudge such use of time for which he is\r\npaying, if the thing be done in reason and with a serious view to\r\nimprovement. The frequent application of what is acquired, as\r\nopportunity offers, in connection with ordinary salesmanship, will help\r\nfix the subject and at the same time increase sales.\r\n\r\nMany gem dealers have been deterred from beginning a study of gems\r\nbecause of the seeming difficulties in connection with the scientific\r\ndetermination of the different varieties of stones. Now science is\r\nnothing but boiled-down common sense, and a bold front will soon\r\nconvince one that most of the difficulties are more apparent than real.\r\nSuch minor difficulties as exist will be approached in such a manner\r\nthat a little effort will overcome them. For those who are willing to do\r\nmore work, this book will suggest definite portions of particular books,\r\nwhich are easily available, for reference reading and study--but the\r\nlessons themselves will attempt to teach the essential things in as\r\nsimple a manner as is possible.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first essential for the gem merchant is to be able surely to\r\ndistinguish the various stones from one another and from synthetic and\r\nimitation stones.\r\n\r\nThat such ability is much needed will be clear to anyone who in casting\r\na backward glance over his experience recalls the many serious mistakes\r\nthat have come to his knowledge. Many more have doubtless occurred\r\nwithout detection. Several times recently the author has come across\r\ncases where large dealers have been mistaken in their determination of\r\ncolored stones, particularly emeralds. Only the other day a ring was\r\nbrought to me that had been bought for a genuine emerald ring after the\r\nbuyer had taken it to one of the dealers in his city and had paid for an\r\nexamination of it, which had resulted in its being declared genuine. On\r\nexamining the stone with a lens of only moderate power, several round\r\nair bubbles were noted in it, and on barely touching it with a file it\r\nwas easily scratched. The material was green glass. Now, what was said\r\nabout the dealer who sold it and the one who appraised it may be\r\nimagined. The long chain of adverse influence which will be put in\r\naction against those dealers, even though the one who sold the stone\r\nmakes good the loss, is something that can be ill afforded by any\r\ndealer, and all this might have been avoided by even a rudimentary\r\nknowledge of the means of distinguishing precious stones. The dealer was\r\ndoubtless honest, but, through carelessness or ignorance, was himself\r\ndeceived.\r\n\r\nOur first few lessons will therefore be concerned chiefly with learning\r\nthe best means of telling the different stones from one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                                              PAGE\r\n PREFACE                                                       iii\r\n\r\n LESSON\r\n      I.--HOW STONES ARE DISTINGUISHED FROM ONE ANOTHER          1\r\n\r\n     II.--REFRACTION                                             4\r\n\r\n    III.--DOUBLE REFRACTION                                      8\r\n\r\n     IV.--ABSORPTION AND DICHROISM                              15\r\n\r\n      V.--SPECIFIC GRAVITY                                      23\r\n\r\n     VI.--SPECIFIC GRAVITY DETERMINATIONS                       31\r\n\r\n    VII.--LUSTER AND OTHER REFLECTION EFFECTS                   38\r\n\r\n   VIII.--HARDNESS                                              47\r\n\r\n     IX.--HARDNESS (_Continued_)                                55\r\n\r\n      X.--DISPERSION                                            60\r\n\r\n     XI.--COLOR                                                 66\r\n\r\n    XII.--COLOR (_Continued_)                                   75\r\n\r\n   XIII.--COLOR (_Continued_)                                   87\r\n\r\n    XIV.--COLOR (_Concluded_)                                   93\r\n\r\n     XV.--HOW TO TELL SCIENTIFIC STONES FROM NATURAL GEMS       99\r\n\r\n    XVI.--HOW TO TEST AN \"UNKNOWN\" GEM                         109\r\n\r\n   XVII.--SUITABILITY OF STONES FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF\r\n            JEWELS, AS DETERMINED BY HARDNESS,\r\n            BRITTLENESS, AND CLEAVABILITY                      119\r\n\r\n  XVIII.--MINERAL SPECIES TO WHICH THE VARIOUS GEMS\r\n            BELONG AND THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION THEREOF        133\r\n\r\n    XIX.--THE NAMING OF PRECIOUS STONES                        149\r\n\r\n     XX.--THE NAMING OF PRECIOUS STONES (_Concluded_)          164\r\n\r\n    XXI.--WHERE PRECIOUS STONES ARE FOUND                      179\r\n\r\n   XXII.--HOW ROUGH PRECIOUS STONES ARE CUT                    201\r\n\r\n  XXIII.--HOW ROUGH PRECIOUS STONES ARE CUT AND WHAT\r\n            CONSTITUTES GOOD \"MAKE\" (_Concluded_)              213\r\n\r\n   XXIV.--FORMS GIVEN TO PRECIOUS STONES                       227\r\n\r\n    XXV.--IMITATIONS OF PRECIOUS STONES                        237\r\n\r\n   XXVI.--ALTERATION OF THE COLOR OF PRECIOUS STONES           250\r\n\r\n  XXVII.--PEARLS                                               258\r\n\r\n XXVIII.--CULTURED PEARLS AND IMITATIONS OF PEARLS             277\r\n\r\n   XXIX.--THE USE OF BALANCES AND THE UNIT OF WEIGHT IN\r\n            USE FOR PRECIOUS STONES                            283\r\n\r\n    XXX.--TARIFF LAWS ON PRECIOUS AND IMITATION STONES         294\r\n\r\n          BIBLIOGRAPHY                                         301\r\n\r\n          INDEX                                                313\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Text-Book of Precious Stones\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON I\r\n\r\nHOW STONES ARE DISTINGUISHED FROM ONE ANOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\nPRECIOUS STONES DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR _PROPERTIES_. One precious stone\r\nis best distinguished from another just as substances of other types are\r\ndistinguished, that is to say, by their _properties_. For example, salt\r\nand sugar are both _white_, both are _soluble in water_, and both are\r\n_odorless_. So far the italicized properties would not serve to\r\ndistinguish the two substances. But sugar is _sweet_ while salt is\r\n_salty_ in taste. Here we have a distinguishing property. Now, just as\r\nsalt and sugar have properties, so have all _precious stones_, and\r\nwhile, as was the case with salt and sugar, many precious stones have\r\nproperties in common, yet each has also some properties which are\r\ndistinctive, and which can be relied upon as differentiating the\r\nparticular stone from other stones. In selecting properties for use in\r\ndistinguishing precious stones, such properties as can be determined by\r\nquantity, and set down in numbers, are probably more trustworthy than\r\nthose that can be observed by mere inspection. Those also which have to\r\ndo with the behavior of light in passing through the stone are extremely\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF NUMERICAL PROPERTIES. It is because gem dealers so often\r\nrely upon the more obvious sort of property, such as color, that they so\r\nfrequently make mistakes. There may be several different types of stones\r\nof a given color, but each will be found to have its own numerical\r\nproperties such as density, hardness, refractive power, dispersive\r\npower, etc., and it is only by an accurate determination of two or three\r\nof these that one can be sure what stone he has in hand. It must next be\r\nour task to find exactly what is meant by each of these numerical\r\nproperties, and how one may determine each with ease and exactness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON II\r\n\r\nREFRACTION\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF REFRACTION. Perhaps the surest single method of\r\ndistinguishing precious stones is to find out the _refractive index_ of\r\nthe material. To one not acquainted with the science of physics this\r\ncalls for some explanation. The term _refraction_ is used to describe\r\nthe bending which light undergoes when it passes (at any angle but a\r\nright angle) from one transparent medium to another. For example, when\r\nlight passes from air into water, its path is bent at the surface of the\r\nwater and it takes a new direction within the water. (See Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nAB represents the path of light in the air and BC its path in the water.\r\n\r\nWhile every gem stone refracts light which enters it from the air, _each\r\nstone has its own definite ability to do this, and each differs from\r\nevery other in the amount of bending which it can bring about under\r\ngiven conditions_. The accurate determination of the amount of bending\r\nin a given case requires very finely constructed optical instruments and\r\nalso a knowledge of how to apply a certain amount of mathematics.\r\nHowever, all this part of the work has already been done by competent\r\nscientists, and tables have been prepared by them, in which the values\r\nfor each material are put down.\r\n\r\nTHE HERBERT-SMITH REFRACTOMETER. There is on the market an instrument\r\ncalled the Herbert-Smith refractometer, by means of which anyone with a\r\nlittle practice can read at once on the scale within the instrument the\r\n_refractive index_, as it is called, of any precious stone that is not\r\ntoo highly refractive. (Its upper limit is 1.80. This would exclude very\r\nfew stones of importance, _i. e._, zircon, diamond, sphene, and\r\ndemantoid garnet.)\r\n\r\nThose readers who wish to make a more intensive study of the\r\nconstruction and use of the refractometer will find a very full and\r\ncomplete account of the subject in _Gem-Stones and their Distinctive\r\nCharacters_, by G. F. Herbert-Smith, New York; James Pott & Co., 1912.\r\nChapter IV., pp. 21-36. The Herbert-Smith refractometer is there\r\ndescribed fully, its principle is explained and directions for using it\r\nare given. The price of the refractometer is necessarily so high (duty\r\nincluded) that its purchase might not be justified in the case of the\r\nsmaller retailer. Every large dealer in colored stones, whether\r\nimporter, wholesaler, or retailer, should have one, as by its use very\r\nrapid and very accurate determinations of stones may be made, and its\r\nuse is not confined to unmounted stones, for any stone whose table facet\r\ncan be applied to the surface of the lens in the instrument can be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON III\r\n\r\nDOUBLE REFRACTION\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF DOUBLE REFRACTION. In Lesson II. we learned what is meant\r\nby _refraction_ of light. While glass and a small number of precious\r\nstones (diamond, garnet, and spinel) bend light as was illustrated in\r\nFig. 1, practically all the other stones cause a beam of light on\r\nentering them to separate, and the path of the light in the stone\r\nbecomes double, as shown in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is called _double refraction_. It may be used to\r\ndistinguish those stones which are doubly refracting from those which\r\nare not. For example, in the case of a stone which is doubly refracting\r\nto a strong degree, such as a peridot (the lighter yellowish-green\r\nchrysolite is the same material and behaves similarly toward light),\r\nthe separation of the light is so marked that the edges of the rear\r\nfacets, as seen through the table, appear _double_ when viewed through a\r\nlens. A zircon will also similarly separate light and its rear facets\r\nalso appear double-lined as seen with a lens from the table of the\r\nstone. The rarer stones, sphene and epidote, likewise exhibit this\r\nproperty markedly. Some colorless zircons, when well cut, so closely\r\nresemble diamonds that even an expert might be deceived, if caught off\r\nhis guard, but this simple test of looking for the doubled lines at the\r\nback of the stone would alone serve to distinguish the two stones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nA SIMPLE BUT VERY VALUABLE TEST FOR THE KIND OF REFRACTION OF A CUT\r\nSTONE. In the case of most of the other doubly refracting stones the\r\ndegree of separation is much less than in peridot and zircon, and it\r\ntakes a well-trained and careful eye to detect the doubling of the\r\nlines. Here a very simple device will serve to assist the eye in\r\ndetermining whether a cut stone is singly or doubly refracting. Expose\r\nthe stone to direct sunlight and hold an opaque white card a few inches\r\nfrom the stone, in the direction of the sun, so as to get the bright\r\nreflections _from within the stone_ reflected onto the card.\r\n\r\nIf the material is singly refractive (as in the case of diamond, garnet,\r\nspinel, and glass), _single images_ of each of the reflecting facets\r\nwill appear on the card, but if doubly refracting--even if slightly\r\nso--_double images_ will appear. When the stone is slightly moved,\r\nthese pairs of reflections will travel _together as pairs_ and not tend\r\nto separate. The space between the two members of each pair of\r\nreflections serves to give a rough idea of the degree of the double\r\nrefraction of the material if compared with the space between members in\r\nthe case of some other kind of stone held at the same distance from the\r\ncard. Thus zircon separates the reflections widely. Aquamarine, which is\r\nfeebly doubly refracting, separates them but slightly.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen at once that we have here a very easily applied test and\r\none that requires no costly apparatus. It is, furthermore, a sure test,\r\nafter a little practice. For example, if one has something that looks\r\nlike a fine emerald, but that may be glass, all one need to do is to\r\nexpose it in the sun, as above indicated. If real emerald, double images\r\nwill be had (very close together, because emerald is but feebly doubly\r\nrefracting). If glass, the images on the card will be single.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, ruby can at once be distinguished from even the finest garnet\r\nor ruby spinel, as the last two are singly refracting. So, too, are\r\nglass imitations of ruby and ruby doublets (which consist of glass and\r\ngarnet). This test cannot injure the stone, it may be applied to mounted\r\nstones, and it is reliable. For stones of very deep color this test may\r\nfail for lack of sufficiently brilliant reflections. In such a case hold\r\nthe card _beyond_ the stone and let the sunlight shine _through_ the\r\nstone onto the card, observing whether the spots of light are single or\r\ndouble.\r\n\r\nThe table below gives the necessary information as to which stones show\r\ndouble and which single refraction.\r\n\r\nTABLE GIVING CHARACTER OF REFRACTION IN THE PRINCIPAL GEMS\r\n\r\n _Refraction Single:_\r\n     Diamond\r\n     Garnet (all types)\r\n     Spinel\r\n     Opal\r\n     Glass\r\n                                    _Difference between\r\n                                    highest and lowest\r\n                                    refractive indices_\r\n _Refraction Double:_\r\n     Sphene                                        .084\r\n     Zircon                                        .053\r\n     Benitoite                                     .047\r\n     Peridot or chrysolite                         .038\r\n     Epidote                                       .031\r\n     Tourmaline                                    .020\r\n     Kunzite                                       .015\r\n     Ruby and sapphire                             .009\r\n     Topaz (precious)                              .009\r\n     Amethyst and quartz topaz                     .009\r\n     Emerald and aquamarine                        .007\r\n     Chrysoberyl                                   .007\r\n\r\nThe student should now put into practice the methods suggested in this\r\nlesson. Look first for the visible doubling of the lines of the back\r\nfacets in peridot (or chrysolite); then in zircon; then in some of the\r\nless strongly doubly refracting stones; then try the sunlight-card\r\nmethod with genuine stones and with doublets and imitations until you\r\ncan tell every time whether you are dealing with singly or doubly\r\nrefracting material. When a stone of unknown identity comes along, try\r\nthe method on it and thus assign it as a first step to one or the other\r\nclass. Other tests will then be necessary to definitely place it.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCES IN REFRACTION DUE TO CRYSTAL FORM. The difference in\r\nbehavior toward light of the singly and doubly refracting minerals\r\ndepends upon the crystal structure of the mineral. All gems whose\r\ncrystals belong in the cubic system are singly refracting in all\r\ndirections: In the case of some other systems of crystals the material\r\nmay be singly refracting in one or in two directions, but doubly\r\nrefracting in other directions. No attention need be paid to these\r\ncomplications, however, when using the sunlight-card method with a cut\r\nstone, for in such a case the light in its course within the stone will\r\nhave crossed the material in two or more directions, and the separation\r\nand consequent doubling of image will be sure to result. For those who\r\nwish to study double refraction more in detail, Chapter VI., pages\r\n40-52, of G. F. Herbert-Smith's _Gem-Stones_ will serve admirably as a\r\ntext. As an alternative any text-book on physics will answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON IV\r\n\r\nABSORPTION AND DICHROISM\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF COLOR IN MINERALS. In Lesson III. we saw that many gem\r\nmaterials cause light that enters them to divide and take two paths\r\nwithin the material. Now all transparent materials _absorb_ light more\r\nor less; that is, they stop part of it, perhaps converting it into heat,\r\nand less light emerges than entered the stone. If light of all the\r\nrainbow colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet) is equally\r\nabsorbed, so that there is the same relative amount of each in the light\r\nthat comes out as in the light that went into a stone, we say that the\r\nstone is a _white_ stone; that is, it is not a _colored_ stone. If,\r\nhowever, only blue light succeeds in getting through, the rest of the\r\nwhite light that entered being absorbed within, we say that we have a\r\nblue stone.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the _color_ of any transparent material depends upon its\r\nrelative degree of absorption of each of the colors in white light. That\r\ncolor which emerges most successfully gives its name to the color of the\r\nstone. Thus a ruby is red because red light succeeds in passing through\r\nthe material much better than light of any other color.\r\n\r\nUNEQUAL ABSORPTION CAUSES DICHROISM. All that has been said so far\r\napplies equally well to both singly and doubly refracting materials, but\r\nin the latter sort it is frequently the case, in those directions in\r\nwhich light always divides, that the absorption is not equal in the two\r\nbeams of light (one is called the ordinary ray and the other the\r\nextraordinary ray).\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of a crystal of ruby, if white light starts to\r\n_cross_ the crystal, it not only divides into an ordinary ray and an\r\nextraordinary ray, but the absorption is different in the two cases,\r\nand the two rays emerge of different shades of red. With most rubies one\r\nray emerges purplish red, the other yellowish red.\r\n\r\nIt will at once be seen that if the human eye could distinguish between\r\nthe two rays, we would have here a splendid method of determining many\r\nprecious stones. Unfortunately, the eye does not analyze light, but\r\nrather blends the effect so that the unaided eye gives but a poor means\r\nof telling whether or not a stone exhibits twin colors, or _dichroism_,\r\nas it is called. (The term signifies two colors.) A well-trained eye\r\ncan, however, by viewing a stone in several different positions, note\r\nthe difference in shade of color caused by the differential absorption.\r\n\r\nTHE DICHROSCOPE. Now, thanks to the scientific workers, there has been\r\ndevised a relatively simple and comparatively inexpensive instrument\r\ncalled the _dichroscope_, which enables one to tell almost at a glance\r\nwhether a stone is or is not dichroic. The construction is indicated in\r\nthe accompanying drawing and description.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DICHROSCOPE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.\r\n\r\nA, simple lens; B, piece of Iceland spar with glass prisms on ends to\r\nsquare them up; C, square hole.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nIf the observer looks through the lens (A) toward a bright light, as,\r\nfor example, the sky, he apparently sees two square holes, Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened is that the light passing through the square hole (C\r\nof Fig. 3) has divided in passing through the strongly doubly refracting\r\nIceland spar (B of Fig. 3) and two images of the square hole are thus\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nIf now a stone that exhibits dichroism is held in front of the square\r\nhole and viewed toward the light, two images of the stone are seen, one\r\ndue to its ordinary ray (which, as was said above, will have one color),\r\nand the other due to its extraordinary ray (which will have a different\r\ncolor or shade of color), thus the color of the two squares will be\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nWith a singly refracting mineral, or with glass, or with a doubly\r\nrefracting mineral when viewed in certain directions of the crystal\r\n(which do not yield double refraction) the colors will be alike in the\r\ntwo squares. Thus to determine whether a red stone is or is not a ruby\r\n(it might be a garnet or glass or a doublet, all of which are singly\r\nrefracting and hence can show no dichroism), hold the stone before the\r\nhole in the dichroscope and note whether or not it produces twin colors.\r\nIf there seems to be no difference of shade turn the stone about, as it\r\nmay have accidentally been placed so that it was viewed along its\r\ndirection of single refraction. If there is still no dichroism it is not\r\na ruby. (_Note._--Scientific rubies exhibit dichroism as well as natural\r\nones, so this test will not distinguish them.)\r\n\r\nA dichroscope may be had for from seven to ten dollars, according to the\r\nmake, and everyone who deals in colored stones should own and use one.\r\n\r\nNot all stones that are doubly refracting exhibit dichroism. White\r\nstones of course cannot exhibit it even though doubly refracting, and\r\nsome colored stones, though strongly doubly refracting, do not exhibit\r\nany noticeable dichroism. The zircon, for example, is strongly doubly\r\nrefracting, but shows hardly any dichroism.\r\n\r\nThe test is most useful for emerald, ruby, sapphire, tourmaline,\r\nkunzite and alexandrite, all of which show marked dichroism.\r\n\r\nIt is of little use to give here the twin colors in each case as the\r\nshades differ with different specimens, according to their depth and\r\ntype of color. The deeper tinted stones of any species show the effect\r\nmore markedly than the lighter ones.\r\n\r\nThe method is rapid and easy--it can be applied to mounted stones as\r\nwell as to loose ones, and it cannot injure a stone. The student should,\r\nif possible, obtain the use of a dichroscope and practice with it on all\r\nsorts of stones. He should especially become expert in distinguishing\r\nbetween rubies, sapphires, and emeralds, and their imitations. The only\r\nimitation (scientific rubies and sapphires are not here classed as\r\nimitations), which is at all likely to deceive one who knows how to use\r\nthe dichroscope is the emerald triplet, made with real (but pale) beryl\r\nabove and below, with a thin strip of green glass between. As beryl is\r\ndoubly refracting to a small degree, and dichroic, one might perhaps be\r\ndeceived by such an imitation if not careful. However, the amount of\r\ndichroism would be less in such a case than in a true emerald of as deep\r\na color.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to study further the subject of dichroism should see\r\n_Gem-Stones_, by G. F. Herbert-Smith, Chapter VII., pp. 53-59, or see _A\r\nHandbook of Precious Stones_, by M. D. Rothschild, Putnam's, pp. 14-16.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON V\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC GRAVITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe properties so far considered as serving to distinguish precious\r\nstones have all depended upon the behavior of the material toward light.\r\n\r\nThese properties were considered first because they afford, to those\r\nacquainted with their use, very rapid and sure means of classifying\r\nprecious stones.\r\n\r\nDENSITY OF MINERALS. We will next consider an equally certain test,\r\nwhich, however, requires rather more time, apparatus, and skill to\r\napply.\r\n\r\nEach kind of precious stone has its own _density_. That is, if pieces of\r\n_different_ stones were taken all of the same size, the _weights_ would\r\ndiffer, but like-sized pieces of one and the same material always have\r\nthe same weight. It is the custom among scientists to compare the\r\ndensities of substances with the density of water. The number which\r\nexpresses the relation between the density of any substance and the\r\ndensity of water is called the _specific gravity_ number of the\r\nsubstance. For example, if, size for size, a material, say diamond, is\r\n3.51 times as heavy as water, its _specific gravity_ is 3.51. It will be\r\nseen that since each substance always has, when pure, the same _specific\r\ngravity_, we have here a means of distinguishing precious stones. It is\r\nvery seldom, if ever, the case that we find any two precious stones of\r\nthe same specific gravity. A few stones have nearly the same specific\r\ngravities, and in such cases it is well to apply other tests also. _In\r\nfact one should always make sure of a stone by seeing that two or three\r\ndifferent tests point to the same species._\r\n\r\nWe must next find out how to determine the specific gravity of a\r\nprecious stone. If the shape of a stone were such that the volume could\r\nbe readily calculated, then one could easily compare the weight with the\r\nvolume or with the weight of the same volume of water, and thus get the\r\nspecific gravity (for a specific gravity number really tells how much\r\nheavier a piece of material is than the same volume of water).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the form of most precious stones is such that it would be\r\nvery difficult to calculate the volume from the measurements, and the\r\nlatter would be hard to make accurately with small stones. To avoid\r\nthese difficulties the following ingenious method has been devised:\r\n\r\nIf a stone is dropped into water it pushes aside, or _displaces_, a body\r\nof water exactly equal in volume to itself. If the water thus displaced\r\nwere caught and weighed, and the weight of the stone then divided by the\r\nweight of the water displaced, we would have the specific gravity number\r\nof the stone.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what is done in getting the specific gravity of small\r\nstones. To make sure of getting an accurate result for the weight of\r\nwater displaced the following apparatus is used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.\r\n\r\nA, Flask-like Bottle; B, Indicates Ground Glass Stopper; C, Shows Hole\r\nDrilled through Stopper.]\r\n\r\nTHE SPECIFIC GRAVITY BOTTLE. A small flask-like bottle (see Fig. 5) is\r\nobtained. This has a tightly fitting _ground_ glass stopper (B). The\r\nstopper has a small hole (C) drilled through it lengthwise. If the\r\nbottle is filled with water, and the stopper dropped in and tightened,\r\nwater will squirt out through the small hole in the stopper. On wiping\r\noff stopper and bottle we have the bottle _exactly full_ of water. If\r\nnow the stopper is removed, the stone to be tested (which must of course\r\nbe smaller than the neck of the bottle) dropped in, and the stopper\r\nreplaced, exactly as much water will squirt out as is equal in volume to\r\nthe stone that was dropped in.\r\n\r\nIf we had weighed the full bottle with the stone _on the pan beside it_,\r\nand then weighed the bottle with the stone _inside it_ we could now, by\r\nsubtracting the last weight from the first, find out how much the water,\r\nthat was displaced, weighed. This is precisely the thing to do. The\r\nweight of the stone being known we now have merely to divide the weight\r\nof the stone by the weight of the displaced water, and we have the\r\nspecific gravity number. Reference to a table of specific gravities of\r\nprecious stones will enable us to name our stone. Such a table follows\r\nthis lesson.\r\n\r\nA SAMPLE CALCULATION. The actual performance of the operation, if one is\r\nskilled in weighing, takes less time than it would to read this\r\ndescription. At first one will be slow, and perhaps one should read and\r\nre-read this lesson, making sure that all the ideas are clear before\r\ntrying to put them in practice.\r\n\r\nA sample calculation may help make the matter clearer, so one is\r\nappended:\r\n\r\n Weight of bottle + stone (outside) = 53.51 carats\r\n Weight of bottle + stone (inside)  = 52.51 carats\r\n                                      ------------\r\n Weight of water displaced          =  1.00  carat\r\n                                      ------------\r\n Weight of stone                    =  3.51 carats\r\n\r\n                    Weight of stone   3.51\r\n Specific gravity = --------------- = ---- = 3.51 Sp. g.\r\n                    Weight of water   1.00\r\n\r\nIn this case the specific gravity being 3.51, the stone is probably\r\ndiamond (see table), but might be precious topaz, which has nearly the\r\nsame specific gravity.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that the jeweler will weigh in carats, and that his\r\nbalance is sensitive to .01 carat. With such a balance, and a specific\r\ngravity bottle (which any scientific supply house will furnish for less\r\nthan $1) results sufficiently accurate for the determination of\r\nprecious stones may be had if one is careful to exclude air bubbles from\r\nthe bottle, and to wipe the outside of the bottle perfectly dry before\r\neach weighing. The bottle should never be held in the warm hands, or it\r\nwill act like a thermometer and expand the water up the narrow tube in\r\nthe stopper, thus leading to error. A handkerchief may be used to grasp\r\nthe bottle.\r\n\r\nTABLE OF SPECIFIC GRAVITIES OF THE PRINCIPAL GEM MATERIALS\r\n\r\n Beryl (Emerald)                                          2.74\r\n Chrysoberyl (Alexandrite)                                3.73\r\n Corundum (Ruby, sapphire, \"Oriental topaz\")              4.03\r\n Diamond                                                  3.52\r\n Garnet (Pyrope)                                          3.78\r\n    \"   (Hessonite)                                       3.61\r\n    \"   (Demantoid, known in the trade as \"Olivine\")      3.84\r\n    \"   (Almandite)                                       4.05\r\n Opal                                                     2.15\r\n Peridot                                                  3.40\r\n Quartz (Amethyst, common topaz)                          2.66\r\n Spinel (Rubicelle, Balas ruby)                           3.60\r\n Spodumene (Kunzite)                                      3.18\r\n Topaz (precious)                                         3.53\r\n Tourmaline                                               3.10\r\n Turquoise                                                2.82\r\n Zircon, lighter variety                                  4.20\r\n    \"    heavier variety                                  4.69\r\n\r\nFor a more complete and scientific discussion of specific gravity\r\ndetermination see _Gem-Stones_, by G.

Rothschild,\r\npp. 21-27, for an excellent account with illustrations; or see any\r\nphysics text-book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VI\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC GRAVITY DETERMINATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIGHING A GEM IN WATER. In the previous lesson it was seen that the\r\nidentity of a precious stone may be found by determining its specific\r\ngravity, which is a number that tells how much heavier the material is\r\nthan a like volume of water. It was not explained, however, how one\r\nwould proceed to get the specific gravity of a stone too large to go in\r\nthe neck of a specific gravity bottle. In the latter case we resort to\r\nanother method of finding how much a like volume of water weighs. If the\r\nstone, instead of being dropped into a perfectly full bottle of water\r\n(which then overflows), be dropped into a partly filled glass or small\r\nbeaker of water, just as much water will be displaced as though the\r\nvessel were full, and it will be displaced _upward_ as before, for lack\r\nof any other place to go. Consequently its weight will tend to buoy up\r\nor float the stone by trying to get back under it, and the stone when in\r\nwater will weigh less than when in air. Anyone who has ever pulled up a\r\nsmall anchor when out fishing from a boat will recognize at once that\r\nthis is the case, and that as the anchor emerges from the water it seems\r\nto suddenly grow heavier. Not only does the stone weigh less when in the\r\nwater, but it weighs exactly as much less as the weight of the water\r\nthat was displaced by the stone (which has a volume equal to the volume\r\nof the stone). If we weigh a stone first in the air, as usual, and then\r\nin water (where it weighs less), and then subtract the weight in water\r\nfrom the weight in air we will have the _loss of weight in water_, and\r\nthis equals the _weight of an equal volume of water_, which is precisely\r\nwhat we got by our bottle method.\r\n\r\nWe now need only divide the weight in air by the loss of weight in\r\nwater, and we shall have the specific gravity of the stone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nTo actually weigh the stone in water we must use a fine wire to support\r\nthe stone. We must first find how much this wire itself weighs (when\r\nattached by a small loop to the hook that supports the balance pan and\r\ntrailing partly in the water, as will be the case when weighing the\r\nstone in water). This weight of the wire must of course be deducted to\r\nget the true weight of the stone in water. The beaker of water is best\r\nsupported by a small table that stands over the balance pan. One can\r\neasily be made out of the pieces of a cigar box. (See Fig. 6.)\r\n\r\nThe wire that is to support the stone should have a spiral at the bottom\r\nin which to lay the gem, and this should be so placed that the latter\r\nwill be completely submerged at all times, but not touching bottom or\r\nsides of the beaker.\r\n\r\nExample of data, and calculation, when getting specific gravity by the\r\nmethod of weighing in water:\r\n\r\n Weight of stone                      = 4.02 carats\r\n                                        -----------\r\n Weight of stone (plus wire) in water = 3.32 carats\r\n Weight of wire                       =  .30  carat\r\n                                        -----------\r\n True weight of stone in water        = 3.02 carats\r\n                                        -----------\r\n Loss of weight in water              = 1.00  carat\r\n\r\n                    Weight of stone   4.02\r\n Specific gravity = --------------- = ---- = 4.02\r\n                     Loss in water    1.00\r\n\r\nHere the specific gravity, 4.02 would indicate some corundum gem (ruby\r\nor sapphire), and the other characters would indicate at once which it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nThe student who means to master the use of the two methods given in\r\nLessons V. and VI. should proceed to practice them with stones of known\r\nspecific gravities until he can at least get the correct result to the\r\nfirst decimal place. It is not to be expected that accurate results can\r\nbe had in the second decimal place, with the balances usually available\r\nto jewelers. When the learner can determine specific gravities with some\r\ncertainty he should then try unknown gems.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity method is of especial value in distinguishing\r\nbetween the various colorless stones, as, for example, quartz crystal,\r\ntrue white topaz, white sapphire, white or colorless beryl, etc. These\r\nare all doubly refractive, have no color, and hence no dichroism, and\r\nunless one has a refractometer to get the refractive index, they are\r\ndifficult to distinguish. The specific gravities are very different,\r\nhowever, and readily serve to distinguish them. It should be added that\r\nthe synthetic stones show the same specific gravities as their natural\r\ncounterparts, so that this test does not serve to detect them.\r\n\r\nWhere many gems are to be handled and separated by specific gravity\r\ndeterminations, perhaps the best way to do so is to have several liquids\r\nof known specific gravity and to see what stones will float and what\r\nones will sink in the liquids. Methylene iodide is a heavy liquid (sp.\r\ng. 3.32), on which a \"quartz-topaz,\" for example, sp. g. 2.66, would\r\nfloat, but a true topaz, sp. g. 3.53, would sink in it. By diluting\r\nmethylene iodide with benzol (sp. g. 0.88) any specific gravity that is\r\ndesired may be had (between the two limits 0.88 and 3.32). Specimens of\r\nknown specific gravity are used with such liquids and their behavior (as\r\nto whether they sink or float, or remain suspended in the liquid,)\r\nindicates the specific gravity of the liquid. An unknown stone may then\r\nbe used and its behavior noted and compared with that of a known\r\nspecimen, whereby one can easily find out whether the unknown is heavier\r\nor lighter than the known sample.\r\n\r\nAn excellent account of the detail of this method is given in G. F.\r\nHerbert-Smith's _Gem-Stones_, pages 64-71, of Chapter VIII., and various\r\nliquids are there recommended. It is doubtful if the practical gem\r\ndealer would find these methods necessary in most cases. Where large\r\nnumbers of many different unknown gems have to be determined it would\r\npay to prepare, and standardize, and use such solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VII\r\n\r\nLUSTER AND OTHER REFLECTION EFFECTS\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the term _luster_ we refer to the manner and degree in which light is\r\nreflected from the _surface_ of a material. Surfaces of the same\r\nmaterial, but of varying degrees of smoothness would, of course, vary in\r\nthe vividness of their luster, but the type of variation that may be\r\nmade use of to help distinguish gems, depends upon the character of the\r\nmaterial more than upon the degree of smoothness of its surface. Just as\r\nsilk has so typical a luster that we speak of it as silky luster, and\r\njust as pearl has a pearly luster, so certain gems have peculiar and\r\ncharacteristic luster. The diamond gives us a good example. Most diamond\r\ndealers distinguish between real and imitation diamonds at a glance by\r\nthe character of the luster. That is the chief, and perhaps the only\r\nproperty, that they rely upon for deciding the genuineness of a diamond,\r\nand they are fairly safe in so doing, for, with the exception of certain\r\nartificially decolorized zircons, no gem stone is likely to deceive one\r\nwho is familiar with the luster of the diamond. It is not to be denied\r\nthat a fine white zircon, when finely cut, may deceive even one who is\r\nfamiliar with diamonds. The author has fooled many diamond experts with\r\nan especially fine zircon, for the luster of zircon does approach,\r\nthough it hardly equals, that of the diamond. Rough zircons are\r\nfrequently mistaken for diamonds by diamond prospectors, and even by\r\npickers in the mines, so that some care should be exercised in any\r\nsuspicious case, and one should not then rely solely on the luster.\r\nHowever, in most cases in the trade there is almost no chance of the\r\nunexpected presence of a zircon and the luster test is usually\r\nsufficient to distinguish the diamond. (Zircons are strongly doubly\r\nrefractive, as was said in Lesson III. on Double Refraction, and with a\r\nlens the doubling of the back lines may be seen.)\r\n\r\nADAMANTINE LUSTER. The luster of a diamond is called _adamantine_ (the\r\nadjective uses the Greek name for the stone itself). It is keen and cold\r\nand glittering, having a metallic suggestion. A very large per cent. of\r\nthe light that falls upon the surface of a diamond at any low angle is\r\nreflected, hence the keenness of its luster. If a diamond and some other\r\nwhite stone, say a white sapphire, are held so as to reflect at the same\r\ntime images of an incandescent light into the eye of the observer, such\r\na direct comparison will serve to show that much more light comes to the\r\neye from the diamond surface than from the sapphire surface. The image\r\nof the light filament, as seen from the diamond, is much keener than as\r\nseen from the sapphire. The same disparity would exist between the\r\ndiamond and almost any other stone. Zircon comes nearest to having\r\nadamantine luster of any of the other gems. The green garnet that is\r\ncalled \"olivine\" in the trade also approaches diamond in luster, hence\r\nthe name \"demantoid,\" or diamond like, sometimes applied to it.\r\n\r\nVITREOUS LUSTER. The other stones nearly all have what is called\r\n_vitreous_ luster (literally, glass like), yet owing to difference of\r\nhardness, and consequent minute differences in fineness of surface\r\nfinish, the keenness of this vitreous luster varies slightly in\r\ndifferent stones, and a trained eye can obtain clues to the identity of\r\ncertain stones by means of a consideration of the luster. Garnets, for\r\nexample, being harder than glass, take a keener polish, and a glance at\r\na doublet (of which the hard top is usually garnet and the base of\r\nglass) will show that the light is better reflected from the garnet part\r\nof the top slope than from the glass part. This use of luster affords\r\nthe quickest and surest means of detecting a doublet. One can even tell\r\na doublet inside a show window, although the observer be outside on the\r\nsidewalk, by moving to a position such that a reflection from the top\r\nslope of the stone is to be had. When a doublet has a complete garnet\r\ntop no such direct comparison can be had, but by viewing first the top\r\nluster, and then the back luster, in rapid succession, one can tell\r\nwhether or not the stone is a doublet.\r\n\r\nOILY LUSTER. Certain stones, notably the peridot (or chrysolite) and the\r\nhessonite (or cinnamon stone), have an oily luster. This is possibly due\r\nto reflection of light that has penetrated the surface slightly and then\r\nbeen reflected from disturbed layers beneath the surface. At any rate,\r\nthe difference in luster may be made use of by those who have trained\r\ntheir eyes to appreciate it. Much practice will be needed before one can\r\nexpect to tell at a glance when he has a peridot (or chrysolite) by the\r\nluster alone, but it will pay to spend some spare time in studying the\r\nluster of the various stones.\r\n\r\nA true, or \"precious\" topaz, for example, may be compared with a yellow\r\nquartz-topaz, and owing to the greater hardness of the true topaz, it\r\nwill be noted that it has a slightly keener luster than the other stone,\r\nalthough both have vitreous luster. Similarly the corundum gems (ruby\r\nand sapphire), being even harder than true topaz, take a splendid\r\nsurface finish and have a very keen vitreous luster.\r\n\r\nTurquoise has a dull waxy luster, due to its slight hardness. Malachite,\r\nalthough soft, has, perhaps because of its opacity, a keen and sometimes\r\nalmost metallic luster.\r\n\r\nOne may note the luster rapidly, without apparatus and without damage to\r\nthe stone. We thus have a test which, while it is not conclusive except\r\nin a very few cases, will supplement and serve to confirm other tests,\r\nor perhaps, if used at first, will suggest what other tests to apply.\r\n\r\nAnother optical effect that serves to distinguish some stones depends\r\nupon the reflection of light from within the material due to a certain\r\nlack of homogeneity in the substance.\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF COLOR IN THE OPAL. Thus the opal is distinguished by the\r\nprismatic colors that emerge from it owing to the effect of thin layers\r\nof material of slightly different density, and hence of different\r\nrefractive index from the rest of the material. These thin films act\r\nmuch as do soap-bubble films, to interfere with light of certain wave\r\nlengths, but to reflect certain other wave lengths and hence certain\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\nAgain, in some sapphires and rubies are found minute, probably hollow,\r\ntube-like cavities, arranged in three sets in the same positions as the\r\ntransverse axes of the hexagonal crystal. The surfaces of these tubes\r\nreflect light so as to produce a six-pointed star effect, especially\r\nwhen the stone is properly cut to a high, round cabochon form, whose\r\nbase is parallel to the successive layers of tubes.\r\n\r\nSTARSTONES, MOONSTONES, CAT'S-EYES. In the moonstone we have another\r\nsort of effect, this time due to the presence of hosts of small twin\r\ncrystal layers that reflect light so as to produce a sort of\r\nmoonlight-on-the-water appearance _within_ the stone when the latter is\r\nproperly cut, with the layers of twin crystals parallel to its base.\r\nCeylon-cut moonstones are frequently cut to save weight, and may have to\r\nbe recut to properly place the layers so that the effect may be seen\r\nequally over all parts of the stone, as set.\r\n\r\nCat's-eye and tiger's-eye owe their peculiar appearance to the presence,\r\nwithin them, of many fine, parallel, silky fibers. The quartz cat's-eye\r\nwas probably once an asbestos-like mineral, whose soft fibers were\r\nreplaced by quartz in solution, and the latter, while giving its\r\nhardness to the new mineral, also took up the fibrous arrangement of the\r\noriginal material. The true chrysoberyl cat's-eye also has a somewhat\r\nsimilar fibrous or perhaps tubular structure. Such stones, when cut _en\r\ncabochon_, show a thin sharp line of light running across the center of\r\nthe stone (when properly cut with the base parallel to the fibers).\r\nThis is due to reflection of light from the surfaces of the parallel\r\nfibers. The line of light runs perpendicularly to the fibers.\r\n\r\nIn these cases (opals, starstones, moonstones, and cat's-eyes) the\r\nindividual stone is usually easily distinguished from other kinds of\r\nstones by its peculiar behavior towards light. However, it must be\r\nremembered that other species than corundum furnish starstones (amethyst\r\nand other varieties of quartz, for example), so that it does not follow\r\nthat any starstone is a corundum gem. Also the more valuable chrysoberyl\r\ncat's-eye may be confused with the cheaper quartz cat's-eye unless one\r\nis well acquainted with the respective appearances of the two varieties.\r\nWhenever there is any doubt other tests should be applied.\r\n\r\nFor further account of luster and other types of reflection effects see\r\n_Gem-Stones_, by G. F. Herbert-Smith, Chapter V., pp. 37-39, or _A\r\nHandbook of Precious Stones_, M. D. Rothschild, pp. 17, 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VIII\r\n\r\nHARDNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother property by means of which one may distinguish the various gems\r\nfrom each other is _hardness_. By hardness is meant the ability to\r\nresist scratching. The term \"hardness\" should not be taken to include\r\ntoughness, yet it is frequently so understood by the public. Most hard\r\nstones are more or less brittle and would shatter if struck a sharp\r\nblow. Other hard stones have a pronounced _cleavage_ and split easily in\r\ncertain directions. True hardness, then, implies merely the ability to\r\nresist abrasion (_i. e._, scratching).\r\n\r\nNow, not only is hardness very necessary in a precious stone in order\r\nthat it may _receive_ and _keep_ a fine polish, but the degree in which\r\nit possesses hardness as compared with other materials of known\r\nhardness may be made use of in identifying it.\r\n\r\nNo scale of _absolute_ hardness has ever come into general use, but the\r\nmineralogist Mohs many years ago proposed the following _relative_\r\nscale, which has been used very largely:\r\n\r\nMOHS'S SCALE OF HARDNESS. Diamond, the hardest of all gems, was rated as\r\n10 by Mohs. This rating was purely arbitrary. Mohs might have called it\r\n100 or 1 with equal reason. It was merely in order to represent the\r\ndifferent degrees of hardness by numbers, that he picked out the number\r\n10 to assign to diamonds. Sapphire (and ruby) Mohs called 9, as being\r\nnext to diamond in hardness. True topaz (precious topaz) he called 8.\r\nQuartz (amethyst and quartz \"topaz\") was given the number 7. Feldspar\r\n(moonstone) was rated 6, the mineral apatite 5, fluorspar 4, calcite 3,\r\ngypsum 2, and talc 1.\r\n\r\nIt may be said here that any mineral in this series, that is of higher\r\nnumber than any other, will scratch the other. Thus diamond (10) will\r\nscratch all the others, sapphire (9) will scratch any but diamond, topaz\r\n(8) will scratch any but diamond and sapphire, and so on.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought that there is any regularity in the degrees of\r\nhardness as expressed by these numbers. The intervals in hardness are by\r\nno means equal to the differences in number. Thus the interval between\r\ndiamond and sapphire, although given but one number of difference, is\r\nprobably greater than that between sapphire (9) and talc (1). The\r\nnumbers thus merely give us an order of hardness. Many gem minerals are,\r\nof course, missing from this list, and most of the minerals from 5 down\r\nto 1 are not gem minerals at all. Few gem materials are of less hardness\r\nthan 7, for any mineral less hard than quartz (7) will inevitably be\r\nworn and dulled in time by the ordinary road dust, which contains much\r\npowdered quartz.\r\n\r\nIn testing a gem for hardness the problem consists in finding out which\r\nof the above minerals is most nearly equal in hardness to the unknown\r\nstone. Any gem that was approximately equal in hardness to a true topaz\r\n(8) would also be said to be of hardness 8. Thus spinel is of about the\r\nsame hardness as topaz and hence is usually rated as 8 in hardness.\r\nSimilarly opal, moonstone, and turquoise are of about the same hardness\r\nas feldspar and are all rated 6.\r\n\r\nFrequently stones will be found that in hardness are between some two of\r\nMohs's minerals. In that case we add one half to the number of the\r\nsofter mineral; thus, peridot, benitoite, and jade (nephrite) are all\r\nsofter than quartz (7) but harder than feldspar (6); hence we say they\r\nare 6-1/2 in hardness. Beryl (aquamarine and emerald), garnet\r\n(almandine), and zircon are rated 7-1/2 in hardness, being softer than\r\ntrue topaz but harder than quartz. A table of the hardness of most of\r\nthe commonly known gem-stones follows this lesson.\r\n\r\nHaving now an idea of what hardness means and how it is expressed, we\r\nmust next inquire how one may make use of it in identifying unknown\r\ngems.\r\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY THE HARDNESS TEST. In the first place, it is necessary to\r\ncaution the beginner against damaging a fine gem by attempting to test\r\nits hardness in any but the most careful manner. The time-honored file\r\ntest is really a hardness test and serves nicely to distinguish genuine\r\ngems, of hardness 7 or above, from glass imitations. A well-hardened\r\nsteel file is of not quite hardness 7, and glass of various types while\r\nvarying somewhat averages between 5 and 6. Hence, glass imitations are\r\neasily attacked by a file. To make the file test use only a _very fine_\r\nfile and apply it with a light but firm pressure lengthwise along the\r\ngirdle (edge) of the unset stone. If damage results it will then be\r\nalmost unnoticeable. Learn to know the _feel_ of the file as it takes\r\nhold of a substance softer than itself. Also learn the _sound_. If\r\napplied to a hard stone a file will slip on it, as a skate slips on ice.\r\nIt will not take hold as upon a softer substance.\r\n\r\nIf the stone is set, press a sharp corner of a broken-ended file gently\r\nagainst a _back_ facet, preferably high up toward the girdle, where any\r\ndamage will not be visible from the front, and move the file very\r\nslightly along the surface, noting by the _feel_ whether or not it takes\r\nhold and also looking with a lens to see if a scratch has been made. Do\r\nnot mistake a line of steel, left on a slightly rough surface, for a\r\ntrue scratch. Frequently on an unpolished girdle of real gem material\r\nthe file will leave a streak of steel. Similarly when using test\r\nminerals in accordance with what follows do not mistake a streak of\r\npowder from the yielding test material, for a true scratch in the\r\nmaterial being tested. The safe way is to wipe the spot thus removing\r\nany powder. A true scratch will, of course, persist.\r\n\r\nA doublet, being usually constructed of a garnet top and a glass back,\r\nmay resist a file at the girdle if the garnet top covers the stone to\r\nthe girdle, as is sometimes the case, especially in the smaller sizes.\r\nIn this case the back must be tested.\r\n\r\nOne should never pass a file rudely across the corners or edges of the\r\nfacets on any stone that may be genuine, as such treatment really\r\namounts to a series of light hammer blows, and the brittleness of most\r\ngem stones would cause them to yield, irrespective of their hardness. It\r\nshould be remembered that some genuine stones are softer than a file, so\r\nthat it will not do to reject as worthless any material that is attacked\r\nby a file. Lapis lazuli (5), sphene (5), opal (6), moonstone (6),\r\namazonite (6), turquoise (6), peridot (6-1/2), demantoid garnet (6-1/2)\r\n(the \"olivine\" of the trade), and jade (nephrite) (6-1/2), are all more\r\nor less attacked by a file.\r\n\r\nTABLE OF HARDNESS OF THE PRINCIPAL GEM-STONES\r\n\r\n 10.

For testing stones that are harder\r\nthan a file the student should provide himself with the following set of\r\nmaterials:\r\n\r\n1. A small crystal of carborundum. (Most hardware stores have specimen\r\ncrystals as attractive advertisements of carborundum as an abrasive\r\nmaterial, or the Carborundum Co., Niagara Falls, N. Y., will supply\r\none.)\r\n\r\n2. A small crystal of sapphire (not of gem quality, but it should be\r\ntransparent and compact. A pale or colorless Montana sapphire can be had\r\nfor a few cents of any mineral dealer).\r\n\r\n3. A small _true topaz_ crystal. (The pure white topaz of Thomas\r\nMountain, Utah, is excellent; or white topaz from Brazil or Japan or\r\nMexico or Colorado will do. Any mineral house can furnish small crystals\r\nfor a few cents when not of specially fine crystallization.)\r\n\r\n4. A small quartz crystal. (This may be either amethyst or quartz-topaz\r\nor the common colorless variety. The fine, sharp, colorless crystals\r\nfrom Herkimer County, N. Y., are excellent. These are very inexpensive.)\r\n\r\n5. A fragment of a crystal of feldspar. (Common orthoclase feldspar,\r\nwhich is frequently of a brownish pink or flesh color, will do.)\r\n\r\nThese five test stones represent the following degrees of hardness:\r\n\r\n1. Carborundum is harder than any gem material but diamond. It will\r\nscratch sapphire and ruby, which are rated 9 in hardness, hence we may\r\ncall carborundum 9-1/2 if we wish. It is, however, very much softer than\r\ndiamond, and the latter will scratch it upon the slightest pressure.\r\n\r\n2. Sapphire, of hardness 9, scratching any gem material except diamond.\r\n\r\n3. True topaz, of hardness 8. It is scratched by sapphire (and, of\r\ncourse, ruby), also by chrysoberyl (which is hence rated 8-1/2), but\r\nscratches most other stones. Spinel (which is also rated as 8 in\r\nhardness) is really a bit harder than topaz.\r\n\r\n4. Quartz, of hardness 7, and scratched by all the previous stones but\r\nscratching those that were listed above as of less hardness than a file.\r\n\r\n5. Feldspar, of hardness 6, hence slightly softer than a file and\r\nyielding to it, but scratching the stones likewise rated as 6 when\r\napplied forcibly to them. Also scratching stones rated as less than 6 on\r\nslight pressure.\r\n\r\nWe must next consider how these minerals may be safely used upon gem\r\nmaterial. Obviously it would be far safer to use them upon rough gem\r\nmaterial than upon cut stones. However, with care and some little skill,\r\none may make hardness tests without particular danger to fine cut\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nThe way to proceed is to apply the cut stone (preferably its girdle, or\r\nif that is so set as not to be available, a corner where several facets\r\nmeet) gently to the flat surface of one of the softer test stones,\r\ndrawing it lightly along the surface and noting the _feel_ and looking\r\nto see if a scratch results. If the test stone is scratched try the next\r\nharder test stone similarly. _Do not attempt to use the test stone upon\r\nany valuable cut stone._ Proceed as above until the gem meets a test\r\nstone that it does not attack. Its hardness is then probably equal to\r\nthe latter and perhaps if pressed forcibly against it a slight scratch\r\nwould result, but it is not advisable to resort to heavy pressure. A\r\nlight touch should be cultivated in this work. Having now an indication\r\nas to the hardness of the unknown gem look up in the table of the\r\nprevious lesson those gems of similar hardness and then by the use of\r\nsome of the tests already given decide which of the stones of that\r\ndegree of hardness you have. _Never rely upon a single test in\r\nidentifying a gem._\r\n\r\nFor further study of hardness and its use in testing gems see\r\n_Gem-Stones_, G. F. Herbert-Smith, Chap. IX., pp. 78-81, and table on p.\r\n305; or see _A Handbook of Precious Stones_, Rothschild, pp. 19, 20,\r\n21.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON X\r\n\r\nDISPERSION\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother property which may be made use of in deciding the identity of\r\ncertain gems is that called _dispersion_. We have seen in Lesson II.\r\nthat light in entering a stone from the air changes its path\r\n(refraction), and in Lesson III. it was explained that many minerals\r\ncause light that enters them, to divide and proceed along two different\r\npaths (double refraction). Now it is further true that light of the\r\nvarious colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet) is\r\nrefracted variously--the violet being bent most sharply, the red least,\r\nand the other colors to intermediate degrees. The cut (Fig. 7)\r\nrepresents roughly and in an exaggerated manner the effect we are\r\ndiscussing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\nNow in a cut stone this separation of light of different colors, or\r\ndispersion of light, as it is called, results in the reflection of each\r\nof the colors separately from the steep sloping back facets of the\r\nstone. If almost any clear, colorless facetted stone is placed in the\r\nsunlight and a card held before it to receive the reflections, it will\r\nbe seen that rainbow-like reflections appear on the card. These\r\n_spectra_, as they are called, are caused by the dispersion of light.\r\nWith a diamond the spectra will be very brilliant and of vivid coloring,\r\nand the red will be widely separated from the blue. With white sapphire\r\nor white topaz, or with rock crystal (quartz), the spectra will be less\r\nvivid--they will appear in pairs (due to the double refraction of these\r\nminerals), and the red and blue will be near together (_i. e._, the\r\nspectra will be short). This shortness in the latter cases is due to the\r\nsmall dispersive power of the three minerals mentioned. Paste (lead\r\nglass) gives fairly vivid spectra, and they are single like those from\r\ndiamond, as glass is singly refracting. The dispersion of the heavy lead\r\nglass approaches that of diamond. The decolorized zircon (jargoon) has a\r\ndispersion well up toward that of diamond and gives fairly vivid spectra\r\non a card, but they are double, as zircon is doubly refracting. Sphene\r\n(a gem rarely seen in the trade) and the demantoid garnet (a green gem\r\noften called \"olivine\" in the trade) both have very high dispersive\r\npower, exceeding the diamond in this respect. As they are both colored\r\nstones (sphene is usually yellowish, sometimes greenish or brown), the\r\nvividness of their color-play is much diminished by absorption of light\r\nwithin them. So also the color-play of a deeply colored fancy diamond\r\nis diminished by absorption.\r\n\r\nDISPERSION AS A TEST OF THE IDENTITY OF A GEM. We may now consider how\r\nan acquaintance with the dispersive powers of the various stones can be\r\nused in distinguishing them. If a stone has high dispersive power it\r\nwill exhibit \"fire,\" as it is called--_i. e._, the various colors will\r\nbe so widely separated within the stone, and hence reflected out so\r\nwidely separated, that they will fall on the eye (as on the card above)\r\nin separate layers, and vivid flashes of red or yellow or other colors\r\nwill be seen. Such stones as the white sapphire (and others of small\r\ndispersion), however, while separating the various colors appreciably as\r\nseen reflected on a card, do not sufficiently separate them to produce\r\nthe \"fire\" effect when the light falls on the eye. This is because the\r\nvarious colors, being very near together in this case, cross the eye so\r\nrapidly, when the stone is moved, that they blend their effect and the\r\neye regards the light that thus falls upon it as white. We have here a\r\nready means of distinguishing the diamond from most other colorless\r\ngems. The trained diamond expert relies (probably unconsciously) upon\r\nthe dispersive effect (or \"fire\") nearly as much as upon the adamantine\r\nluster, in telling at a glance whether a stone is or is not a diamond.\r\nOf all colorless stones, the only one likely to mislead the expert in\r\nthis respect is the whitened zircon (jargoon), which has almost\r\nadamantine luster and in addition nearly as high dispersive power as\r\ndiamond. However, zircon is doubly refracting (strongly so), and the\r\ndivision of the spectra which results (each facet producing two instead\r\nof only one) weakens the \"fire\" so that even the best zircon is a bit\r\n\"sleepy\" as compared with even an ordinary diamond.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing a ready means of identifying the diamond, a\r\nhigh degree of dispersion in a stone of pronounced color would lead one\r\nto consider sphene, demantoid garnet (if green), and zircon (which\r\nmight be reddish, yellowish, brown, or of other colors), and if the\r\nstone did not agree with these in its other properties one should\r\nsuspect _glass_.\r\n\r\nA good way to note the degree of dispersion, aside from the\r\nsunlight-card method, is to look at the stone from the back while\r\nholding it up to the light (daylight). Stones of high dispersive power\r\nwill display vivid color play in this position. Glass imitations of\r\nrubies, emeralds, amethysts, etc., will display altogether too much\r\ndispersion for the natural gems.\r\n\r\nIn Chap. III., p. 20, of G. F. Herbert-Smith's _Gem-Stones_, a brief\r\naccount of dispersion is given. College text-books on physics also treat\r\nof it, and the latter give an account of how dispersion is measured and\r\nwhat is meant by a coefficient of dispersion. Most gem books say little\r\nabout it, but as we have seen above, a knowledge of the matter can, when\r\nsupplemented by other tests, be applied practically in distinguishing\r\ngems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XI\r\n\r\nCOLOR\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reserving to the last the property of _color_, which many dealers in\r\ngems use first when attempting to identify a precious stone, I have\r\nsought to point out the fact that a determination based solely upon\r\ncolor is very likely to be wrong. So many mineral species are found in\r\nso many different colors that to attempt to identify any mineral species\r\nby color alone is usually to invite disaster. The emerald, alone among\r\ngems, has, when of fine color, a hue that is not approached by any other\r\nspecies. The color of the grass in the springtime fitly describes it.\r\nYet even here the art of man has so closely counterfeited in glass the\r\ngreen of the emerald that one cannot be sure of his stone by color\r\nalone. As was suggested earlier in these lessons, the writer has\r\nseveral times recently had occasion to condemn as glass imitations\r\nstones for which high prices had been paid as genuine emeralds, those\r\nwho sold them having relied solely upon a trained eye for color.\r\n\r\nCONFUSION OF GEMS DUE TO SIMILARITY OF COLOR. The same tendency to rely\r\nupon color causes many in the trade to call all yellow stones \"topaz\"\r\nwhether the species be corundum (oriental topaz), true topaz (precious\r\ntopaz), citrine quartz (quartz topaz), heliodor (yellow beryl), jacinth\r\n(yellow zircon), or what not.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the public calls all red stones ruby. Thus we have \"cape ruby\"\r\nand \"Arizona ruby\" (pyrope garnet), \"spinel ruby\" (more properly ruby\r\nspinel), \"Siam ruby\" (very dark red corundum), \"Ceylon ruby\" (pale\r\npinkish corundum), rubellite (pink tourmaline), and lastly Burmah ruby\r\n(the fine blood-red corundum).\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that color, unless skillfully estimated and wisely used\r\nin conjunction with other properties, is a most unreliable guide, yet\r\nwhen thus used, it becomes a great help and serves sometimes to narrow\r\ndown the chase, at the start, to a very few species. To thus make use of\r\nit requires an actual acquaintance with the various gem materials, in\r\ntheir usual colors and shades and an eye trained to note and to remember\r\nminute differences of tint and shade. The suggestions which follow as to\r\nusual colors of mineral species must then be used only with discretion\r\nand after much faithful study of many specimens of each of the species.\r\n\r\nLet us begin with the beginning color of the visible spectrum, red, and\r\nconsider how a close study of shades of red can help in distinguishing\r\nthe various red stones from each other. In the first place we will\r\ninquire what mineral species are likely to furnish us with red stones.\r\nOmitting a number of rare minerals, we have (1) corundum ruby, (2)\r\ngarnet of various types, (3) zircon, (4) spinel, (5) tourmaline. These\r\nfive minerals are about the only common species which give us an\r\nout-and-out red stone. Let us now consider the distinctions between the\r\nreds of these different species. The red of the ruby, whether dark (Siam\r\ntype), blood red (Burmah type), or pale (Ceylon), is more pleasing\r\nusually than the red of any of the other species. Viewed from the back\r\nof the stone (by transmitted light) it is still pleasing. It may be\r\npurplish, but is seldom orange red. Also, owing to the dichroism of the\r\nruby the red is variable according to the changing position of the\r\nstone. It therefore has a certain life and variety not seen in any of\r\nthe others except perhaps in red tourmaline, which, however, does not\r\napproach ruby in fineness of red color.\r\n\r\nRED STONES OF SIMILAR SHADES. The garnet, on the other hand, when of\r\nfire-red hue, is darker than any but the Siam ruby. It is also more\r\ninclined to orange red or brownish red--and the latter is especially\r\ntrue when the stone is seen against the light (by transmitted light).\r\nIts color then resembles that of a solution of \"iron\" such as is given\r\nas medicine. The so-called \"almandine\" garnets (those of purplish-red\r\ntint) do not equal the true ruby in brightness of color and when held up\r\nto the light show more prismatic colors than the true ruby, owing to the\r\ngreater dispersion of garnet. The color also lacks variety (owing to\r\nlack of dichroism). While a fine garnet may make a fair-looking \"ruby\"\r\nwhen by itself, it looks inferior and dark when beside a fine ruby. By\r\nartificial light, too, the garnet is dark as compared with the true\r\nruby, and the latter shows its color at a distance much more strongly\r\nthan the garnet.\r\n\r\nThe red zircon, or true hyacinth, is rare. (Many hessonite garnets are\r\nsold as hyacinths in the trade. These are usually of a brownish red.)\r\nThe red of the hyacinth is never equal to that of the ruby. It is\r\nusually more somber, and a bit inclined to a brownish cast. The\r\ndispersion of zircon, too, is so large (about 87 per cent. of that of\r\ndiamond) that some little \"color-play\" is likely to appear along with\r\nthe intrinsic color. The luster too is almost adamantine while that of\r\nruby is softer and vitreous. Although strongly doubly refracting, the\r\nhyacinth shows scarcely any dichroism and thus lacks variety of color.\r\nHence a trained eye will at once note these differences and not confound\r\nthe stone with ruby.\r\n\r\nSpinels, when red, are almost always more yellowish or more purplish\r\nthan fine corundum rubies. They are also singly refracting and hence\r\nexhibit no dichroism and therefore lack variety of color as compared\r\nwith true ruby. Some especially fine ones, however, are of a good enough\r\nred to deceive even jewelers of experience, and one in particular that I\r\nhave in mind has been the rounds of the stores and has never been\r\npronounced a spinel, although several \"experts\" have insisted that it\r\nwas a scientific ruby. The use of a dichroscope would have saved them\r\nthat error, for the stone is singly refracting. Spinels are usually\r\nclearer and more transparent than garnets and show their color better at\r\na distance or when in a poor light.\r\n\r\nTourmaline of the reddish variety (rubellite) is seldom of a deep red.\r\nIt is more inclined to be pinkish. The dichroism of tourmaline is\r\nstronger than that of ruby and more obvious to the unaided eye. The red\r\nof the rubellite should not deceive anyone who has ever seen a fine\r\ncorundum ruby.\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW STONES\r\n\r\nConsidering next the stones of yellow color, we have the following\r\nspecies to deal with: (1) diamond, (2) corundum, (3) precious topaz, (4)\r\nquartz, (5) beryl, (6) zircon, (7) tourmaline.\r\n\r\nYELLOW ZIRCON RESEMBLES YELLOW DIAMOND. Here we have less opportunity to\r\njudge of the species by the color than was the case with the red\r\nstones. The diamond, of course, is easy to tell, not by the kind of\r\nyellow that it displays, for it varies greatly in that respect, but\r\nrather by its prismatic play blended with the intrinsic color. Its\r\nluster also gives an immediate clue to its identity. It is necessary,\r\nhowever, to be sure that we are not being deceived by a yellow zircon,\r\nfor the latter has considerable \"fire\" and a keen luster. Its strong\r\ndouble refraction and its relative softness, as well as its great\r\ndensity will serve to distinguish it. Of the other yellow stones, the\r\ntrue or precious topaz is frequently inclined to a pinkish or wine\r\nyellow and many such stones lose all their yellow (retaining their pink)\r\nwhen gently heated. The so-called \"pinked\" topazes are thus produced.\r\n\r\nThe yellow corundum rarely has a color that is at all distinctive. As\r\nfar as color goes the material might be yellow quartz, or yellow beryl,\r\nor yellow zircon, or yellow tourmaline (Ceylon type). Many of the\r\nyellowish tourmalines have a decidedly greenish cast (greenish-yellow\r\nchrysoberyl might resemble these also). However, in general if one has a\r\nyellow stone to determine it will be safer to make specific gravity or\r\nhardness tests, or both, before deciding, rather than to rely upon\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XII\r\n\r\nCOLOR--_Continued_\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN STONES\r\n\r\nLet us first consider what mineral species are most likely to give us\r\ngreen stones. Omitting the semi-precious opaque or translucent stones we\r\nhave:\r\n\r\n    1. Grass-green beryl (the emerald) which is, of course, first in\r\n    value among the green stones and first in the fine quality of its\r\n    color.\r\n\r\n    2. Tourmaline (some specimens of which perhaps more nearly approach\r\n    the emerald than any other green stones).\r\n\r\n    3. The demantoid garnet (sometimes called \"olivine\" in the trade).\r\n\r\n    4. True olivine (the peridot and the chrysolite of the trade).\r\n\r\n    5. Bluish-green beryl (aquamarine).\r\n\r\n    6. Green sapphire (Oriental emerald or Oriental aquamarine).\r\n\r\n    7. Chrysoberyl (alexandrite and also the greenish-yellow\r\n    chrysoberyl).\r\n\r\n1. Considering first the emerald, we have as legitimate a use of color\r\nin distinguishing a stone as could be selected, for emerald of fine\r\ngrass-green color is not equaled by any other precious stone in the rich\r\nvelvety character of its color. We have to beware here, however, of the\r\nfine glass imitations, which, while lacking the variety of true emerald,\r\nbecause of lack of dichroism, are nevertheless of a color so nearly like\r\nthat of the emerald that no one should attempt to decide by color alone\r\nas to whether a stone is genuine or imitation emerald. If a hardness\r\ntest shows that the material is a genuine hard stone and not a paste,\r\nthen one who is well accustomed to the color of fine emerald can say at\r\nonce whether a stone is a fine emerald or some other hard green stone.\r\nWhere the color is less fine, however, one might well refuse to decide\r\nby the color, even when sure that the material is not glass, for some\r\nfine tourmalines approach some of the poorer emeralds in richness of\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nTHE \"SCIENTIFIC EMERALD\" FRAUD. No \"scientific\" emeralds of marketable\r\nsize have ever been produced as far as can be learned. Many attempts to\r\nreproduce emerald by melting beryl or emerald of inferior color have\r\nresulted only in the production of a beryl glass, which, while its color\r\nmight be of desirable shade, was softer and lighter in weight than true\r\nemerald. It was also a true glass and hence singly refracting and\r\nwithout dichroism, whereas emerald is crystalline (not glassy or\r\namorphous), is doubly refracting, and shows dichroism.\r\n\r\nDo not be misled, then, into buying or selling an imitation of emerald\r\nunder the terms \"synthetic,\" \"scientific,\" or \"reconstructed,\" as such\r\nterms, when so used, are used to deceive one into thinking that the\r\nproduct offered bears the same relation to the true emerald that\r\nscientific rubies and sapphires bear to the natural stones. Such is not\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nAbout the most dangerous imitation of the emerald that is ever seen in\r\nthe trade is the triplet that has a top and a back made of true but pale\r\nberyl (the same mineral as emerald, but not of the right color) and a\r\nthin slice of deep emerald green glass laid between. This slice of glass\r\nis usually placed behind the girdle so that a file will not find any\r\npoint of attack. The specific gravity of the triplet is practically that\r\nof emerald, its color is often very good, and it is doubly refracting.\r\nIt is thus a dangerous imitation. (See Fig. 8.)\r\n\r\nEMERALD TRIPLETS. A careful examination of one of these triplets, in the\r\nunset condition, with a good lens, will reveal the thin line of junction\r\nof the beryl with the glass. (The surface lusters of the two materials\r\nare enough different for the trained eye to detect the margin at once.)\r\nSuch a triplet, if held in the sun, will reflect onto a card two images\r\nin pale or white light, one coming from the top surface of the table and\r\nthe other from the top surface of the glass slice within. In other\r\nwords, it acts in this respect like a doublet. A true emerald would give\r\nonly one such reflection, which would come from the top surface of the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--EMERALD TRIPLET.]\r\n\r\n2. Tourmalines, when green, are usually darker than emeralds and of a\r\nmore pronounced yellow green, or they may be of too bluish a green, as\r\nis the case with some of the finest of the green tourmalines from\r\nMaine. Connecticut green tourmaline tends more to the dark yellowish\r\ngreen, and Ceylon tourmaline to the olive green. The stronger dichroism\r\nof the tourmaline frequently reveals itself to the naked eye, and there\r\nis usually one direction or position in which the color of the stone is\r\nvery inferior to its color in the opposite direction or position. Most\r\ntourmalines (except the very lightest shades) must be cut so that the\r\ntable of the finished stone lies on the side of the crystal, as, when\r\ncut with the table lying across the crystal (perpendicular to the\r\nprincipal optical axis) the stones are much too dark to be pretty. Hence\r\nwhen one turns the cut stone so that he is looking in the direction\r\nwhich was originally up and down the crystal (the direction of single\r\nrefraction and of no dichroism) he gets a glimpse of a less lovely color\r\nthan is furnished by the stone in other positions. With a true emerald\r\nno such disparity in the color would appear. There might be a slight\r\nchange of shade (as seen by the naked eye), but no trace of an ugly\r\nshade would appear.\r\n\r\nBy studying many tourmalines and a few emeralds one may acquire an eye\r\nfor the differences of color that characterize the two stones, but it is\r\nstill necessary to beware of the fine glass imitation and to use the\r\nfile and also to look with a high-power glass for any rounding bubbles.\r\nThe emerald will never have the latter. The glass imitation frequently\r\ndoes have them. The sharp jagged flaws and cracks that so often appear\r\nin emerald are likely to appear also in tourmaline as both are brittle\r\nmaterials. The glass imitations frequently have such flaws put into them\r\neither by pinching or by striking the material. Frequently, too, wisps\r\nof tiny air bubbles are left in the glass imitations in such fashion\r\nthat unless one scrutinizes them carefully with a good lens they\r\nstrongly resemble the flaws in natural emerald.\r\n\r\nI have thus gone into detail as to how one may distinguish true emerald\r\nfrom tourmaline and from glass imitations because, on account of the\r\nhigh value of fine emerald and its infrequent occurrence, there is\r\nperhaps more need for the ability to discriminate between it and its\r\nimitations and substitutes than there is in almost any other case. Where\r\nvalues are high the temptation to devise and to sell imitations or\r\nsubstitutes is great and the need for skill in distinguishing between\r\nthe real and the false is proportionally great.\r\n\r\n3. The demantoid garnet (often unfortunately and incorrectly called\r\n\"olivine\" in the trade) is usually of an olive or pistachio shade. It\r\nmay, however, approach a pale emerald. The refraction being single in\r\nthis, as in all garnets, there is little variety to the color. The\r\ndispersion being very high, however, there is a strong tendency, in\r\nspite of the depth of the body color, for this stone to display \"fire,\"\r\nthat is, rainbow color effects. The luster, too, is diamond-like as the\r\nname \"demantoid\" signifies. With this account of the stone and a few\r\nchances to see the real demantoid garnet beside an emerald no one would\r\nbe likely to mistake one for the other. The demantoid garnet is also\r\nvery soft as compared with emerald (6-1/2 as against nearly 8).\r\n\r\n4. True olivine (the peridot or the chrysolite of the trade) is of a\r\nfine leaf-green or bottle-green shade in the peridot. The chrysolite of\r\nthe jeweler is usually of a yellower green. Frequently an olive-green\r\nshade is seen. The luster of olivine (whether of the peridot shade or\r\nnot) is oily, and this may serve to distinguish it from tourmaline\r\n(which it may resemble in color). Its double refraction is very large\r\nalso, so that the doubling of the edges of the rear facets may easily be\r\nseen through the table with a lens. The dichroism is feeble too, whereas\r\nthat of tourmaline is strong. No one would be likely to confuse the\r\nstone with true emerald after studying what has preceded.\r\n\r\n5. Bluish-green beryl (aquamarine) is usually of a pale transparent\r\ngreen or blue green (almost a pure pale blue is also found).\r\n\r\nHaving all the properties of its more valuable variety, emerald, the\r\npale beryl may, by the use of these properties, be distinguished from\r\nthe pale blue-green topaz which so strongly resembles it in color.\r\n\r\n6. Green sapphire seldom even approaches emerald in fineness of color.\r\nWhen it remotely suggests emerald it is called \"Oriental\" emerald to\r\ndenote that it is a corundum gem. Most green sapphires are of too blue a\r\ngreen to resemble emerald. Some are really \"Oriental\" aquamarines. In\r\nsome cases the green of the green sapphire is due to the presence,\r\nwithin the cut stone, of both blue and yellow portions, the light from\r\nwhich, being blended by its reflection within the stone, emerges as\r\ngreen as seen by the unaided eye, which cannot analyze colors. The dark\r\nsapphires of Australia are frequently green when cut in one direction\r\nand deep blue when cut in the opposite direction. The green, however,\r\nis seldom pleasing.\r\n\r\n7. Chrysoberyl as usually seen is of a yellowish green. The fine gem\r\nchrysoberyls known as alexandrites, however, have a pleasing bluish\r\ngreen or deep olive green color by daylight and change in a most\r\nsurprising fashion by artificial light under which they show raspberry\r\nred tints. This change, according to G. F. Herbert-Smith, is due\r\nprincipally to the fact that the balance in the spectrum of light\r\ntransmitted by the stone is so delicate that when a light, rich in short\r\nwave lengths, falls upon it the blue green effect is evident, whereas\r\nwhen the light is rich in long wave lengths (red end of the spectrum),\r\nthe whole stone appears red. The strong dichroism of the species also\r\naids this contrast. The chrysoberyls of the cat's-eye type (of fibrous\r\nor tubular internal structure) are usually of olive green or\r\nbrownish-green shades.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to further study color distinctions in green stones are\r\nrecommended to see the chapters on beryl (pp. 184-196), peridot (pp.\r\n225-227), corundum (pp. 172-183), tourmaline (pp. 219-224), chrysoberyl\r\n(pp. 233-237), and garnet (demantoid, pp. 216-218) in G. F.\r\nHerbert-Smith's _Gem-Stones_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIII\r\n\r\nCOLOR--_Continued_\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE STONES\r\n\r\nThe species that furnish blue stones in sufficient number to deserve\r\nconsideration are, aside from opaque stones:\r\n\r\n    1. Corundum (sapphire).\r\n\r\n    2. Spinel.\r\n\r\n    3. Tourmaline.\r\n\r\n    4. Topaz.\r\n\r\n    5. Diamond.\r\n\r\n    6. Zircon.\r\n\r\n1. Of these minerals the only species that furnishes a fine, deep\r\nvelvety blue stone is the corundum, and fine specimens of the cornflower\r\nblue variety are very much in demand and command high prices. The color\r\nin sapphires ranges from a pale watery blue through deeper shades (often\r\ntinged with green) to the rich velvety cornflower blue that is so much\r\nin demand, and on to dark inky blues that seem almost black by\r\nartificial light. Most sapphires are better daylight stones than evening\r\nstones. Some of the sapphires from Montana, however, are of a bright\r\nelectric blue that is very striking and brilliant by artificial light.\r\n\r\nHOW SAPPHIRES SHOULD BE CUT. The direction in which the stone is cut\r\nhelps determine the quality of the blue color, as the \"ordinary\" ray\r\n(sapphire exhibits dichroism) is yellowish and ugly in color, and if\r\nallowed to be conspicuous in the cut stone, its presence, blending with\r\nthe blue, may give it an undesirable greenish cast. Sapphires should\r\nusually be cut so that the table of the finished stone is perpendicular\r\nto the principal optical axis of the crystal. Another way of expressing\r\nthis fact is that the table should cross the long axis of the usual\r\nhexagonal crystal of sapphire, at right angles. This scheme of cutting\r\nputs the direction of single refraction up and down the finished stone,\r\nand leaves the ugly ordinary rays in poor position to emerge as the\r\nlight that falls upon the girdle edges cannot enter and cross the stone\r\nto any extent.\r\n\r\nTo find out with a finished stone whether or not the lapidary has cut it\r\nproperly as regards its optical properties one may use the dichroscope,\r\nand if there is little or no dichroism in evidence when looking through\r\nthe table of the stone it is properly cut.\r\n\r\nWhere a sapphire shows a poor color and the dichroscope shows that the\r\ntable was laid improperly, there is some possibility of improving the\r\ncolor by recutting to the above indicated position. However, one must\r\nuse much judgment in such a case, as sapphires, like other corundum\r\ngems, frequently have their color irregularly distributed, and the\r\nskillful lapidary will place the culet of the stone in a bit of good\r\ncolor, and thus make the whole stone appear to better advantage. It\r\nwould not do to alter such an arrangement, as one would get poorer\r\nrather than better color by recutting in such a case.\r\n\r\nWhile some of the blue stones about to be described may resemble\r\ninferior sapphires, none of them approaches the better grades of\r\nsapphire in fineness of blue coloration. The scientific sapphire, of\r\ncourse, does approach and even equals the natural sapphire so that one\r\nmust know how to distinguish between them. This distinction is not one\r\nof color, however, and it will be separately considered a little later.\r\n\r\n2. Blue spinels are infrequently seen in commerce. They never equal the\r\nfine sapphire in their color, being more steely. They, of course, lack\r\ndichroism and are softer than sapphire as well as lighter.\r\n\r\n3. Blue tourmalines are never of fine sapphire blue. The name indicolite\r\nwhich mineralogists give to these blue stones suggests the indigo-blue\r\ncolor which they afford. The marked dichroism of tourmaline will also\r\nhelp detect it. Some tourmalines from Brazil are of a lighter shade of\r\nblue and are sometimes called \"Brazilian sapphires.\"\r\n\r\n4. Blue topaz is usually of a pale sky blue or greenish blue and is\r\nlikely to be confused with beryl of similar color. The high density of\r\ntopaz (3.53) as compared with beryl (2.74) serves best to distinguish\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"FANCY\" BLUE DIAMONDS. 5. Blue diamonds are usually of very pale bluish\r\nor violet tint. A few deeper blue stones are seen occasionally as\r\n\"fancy\" diamonds. These are seldom as deep blue as pale sapphires. Even\r\nthe famous Hope Blue Diamond, a stone of about forty-four carats and of\r\ngreat value, is said to be too light in color to be considered a fine\r\nsapphire blue. Some of the deeper blue diamonds have a steely cast. The\r\nso-called blue-white stones are rarely blue in their body color, but\r\nrather are so nearly white that the blue parts of the spectra which they\r\nproduce are very much in evidence, thus causing them to face up blue.\r\nThere is little likelihood of mistaking a bluish diamond for any other\r\nstone on account of the \"fire\" and the adamantine luster of the diamond.\r\n\r\n6. Blue zircon, however, has nearly adamantine luster and considerable\r\nfire. The color is usually sky blue. Such stones are seldom met with in\r\nthe trade.\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed account of the various blue stones see G. F.\r\nHerbert-Smith's _Gem-Stones_, as follows:\r\n\r\nFor sapphires, pp. 172-173, 176, 182; for spinel, pp. 203, 204, 205; for\r\ntourmaline, pp. 220, 221, 223; for topaz, pp. 198, 200, 201; for\r\ndiamond, pp. 130, 136, 170, and for zircon, pp. 229, 231.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIV\r\n\r\nCOLOR--_Concluded_\r\n\r\n\r\nPINK, PURPLE, BROWN, AND COLORLESS STONES\r\n\r\nPINK STONES. Pink stones are yielded by (1) corundum (pink sapphire),\r\n(2) spinel (balas ruby), (3) tourmaline (rubellite), (4) true topaz\r\n(almost always artificially altered), (5) beryl (morganite), (6)\r\nspodumene (kunzite), and (7) quartz (rose-quartz).\r\n\r\nThese pink minerals are not easily differentiated by color alone, as the\r\ndepth and quality of the pink vary greatly in different specimens of the\r\nsame mineral and in the different minerals. There is dichroism in the\r\ncases of pink sapphire, pink tourmaline (strong), pink topaz (strong),\r\npink beryl (less pronounced), and kunzite (very marked and with a\r\nyellowish tint in some directions that contrasts with the beautiful\r\nviolet tint in another direction in the crystal). Pink quartz is almost\r\nalways milky, and shows little dichroism. Pink spinel is without\r\ndichroism, being singly refracting. Hardness and specific gravity tests\r\nwill best serve to distinguish pink stones from each other. The color\r\nalone is not a safe guide.\r\n\r\nPURPLE STONES. Among the mineral species that furnish purple stones, (1)\r\nquartz is pre-eminent in the fineness of the purple color. Such purple\r\nstones are, of course, known as amethysts. After quartz come (2)\r\ncorundum (Oriental amethyst), (3) spinel (almandine spinel), (4) garnet\r\n(almandine), and (5) spodumene (variety kunzite).\r\n\r\nThe purple of the amethyst varies from the palest tints to the full rich\r\nvelvety grape-purple of the so-called Siberian amethysts. The latter are\r\nof a reddish purple (sometimes almost red) by artificial light, but of a\r\nfine violet by daylight. No other purple stone approaches them in\r\nfineness of coloring, so that here we have a real distinction based on\r\ncolor alone. If the purple is paler, however, one cannot be sure of the\r\nmineral by its color. Purple corundum (Oriental amethyst) is seldom as\r\nfine in color as ordinary amethyst, and never as fine as the best\r\namethyst. It is usually of a redder purple, and by artificial light is\r\nalmost ruby-like in its color.\r\n\r\nPurple spinels are singly refracting, and lack dichroism, and hence lack\r\nvariety of color. Almandine garnets also show no dichroism and lack\r\nvariety of color. The garnets are, as a rule, apt to be more dense in\r\ncolor than the spinels.\r\n\r\nPurple spodumene (kunzite) is pinkish to lilac in shade--usually pale,\r\nunless in large masses, and it shows very marked dichroism. A yellowish\r\ncast of color may be seen in certain directions in it also, which will\r\naid in distinguishing it from other purple stones.\r\n\r\nBROWN STONES. (1) Diamond, (2) garnet, (3) tourmaline, and (4) zircon\r\nfurnish the principal brown stones.\r\n\r\nDiamond, when brown, unless of a deep and pleasing color, is very\r\nundesirable, as it absorbs much light, and appears dirty by daylight and\r\ndark and sleepy by artificial light. When of a fine golden brown a\r\ndiamond may have considerable value as a \"fancy\" stone. Such \"golden\r\nfancies\" can be distinguished from other brown stones (except perhaps\r\nbrown zircons) by their adamantine luster, and their prismatic play or\r\n\"fire.\"\r\n\r\nBrown garnet (hessonite or cinnamon stone), sometimes wrongly called\r\nhyacinth in the trade, is of a deep reddish-brown color. Usually the\r\ninterior structure, as seen under a lens, is streaky, having a sort of\r\nmixed oil and water appearance.\r\n\r\nBrown tourmaline is sometimes very pleasing in color. It is deep in\r\nshade, less red than cinnamon stone, and with marked dichroism, which\r\nboth brown diamond and brown garnet lack.\r\n\r\nBrown zircon, while lacking dichroism, is frequently rich and pleasing\r\nin shade, and when well cut is very snappy, the luster being almost\r\nadamantine, the dispersion being large, and the refractive index high.\r\nIt is useless to deny that by the unaided eye one might be deceived into\r\nthinking that a fine brown zircon was a brown diamond. However, the\r\nlarge double refraction of the zircon easily distinguishes it from\r\ndiamond (use the sunlight-card method or look for the doubling of the\r\nedges of the rear facets as seen through the table). The relative\r\nsoftness (7-1/2) also easily differentiates it from diamond.\r\n\r\nCOLORLESS STONES. Few colorless stones other than diamond, white\r\nsapphire (chiefly scientific), and quartz are seen in the trade.\r\nColorless true topaz is sometimes sold and artificially whitened zircon\r\n(jargoon) is also occasionally met with. Beryl of very light green tint\r\nor even entirely colorless may also be seen at times.\r\n\r\nSuch colorless stones must of course be distinguished by properties\r\nother than color. They are mentioned here merely that the learner may be\r\naware of what varieties of gem minerals occur in the colorless\r\ncondition, and that all these minerals also occur with color in their\r\nmore usual forms. This does not even except the diamond, which is rarely\r\ntruly colorless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XV\r\n\r\nHOW TO TELL SCIENTIFIC STONES FROM NATURAL GEMS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should be said first that the only true scientific or synthetic\r\nstones on the market are those having the composition and properties of\r\ncorundum, that is to say, the ruby and the several color varieties of\r\nsapphire, as blue, pink, yellow, and white. There is also a greenish\r\nstone that appears reddish by artificial light, which is called\r\nscientific alexandrite but which has, however, the composition and\r\nproperties of the corundum gems rather than those of true alexandrite.\r\nAll so-called \"scientific emeralds\" have proved to be either of paste of\r\none sort or another, or else triplets having a top and a back of some\r\ninexpensive but hard stone of pale color, and a central slice of deep\r\ngreen glass, the three pieces being cemented together so skillfully\r\nthat the junctions frequently escape any but a very careful examination\r\nwith a lens.\r\n\r\nALL SCIENTIFIC STONES ARE CORUNDUM GEMS. Now the fact that all true\r\nscientific stones are corundum gems makes their determination fairly\r\nsimple on the following basis: Among the considerable number of corundum\r\ngems of nature, whether ruby or sapphire of various colors, there is\r\nseldom found one that is entirely free from defects. Almost always, even\r\nin what are regarded as fine specimens, one will easily find with a\r\nglass, defects in the crystallization. Moreover these defects are\r\ncharacteristic of the corundum gems.\r\n\r\nThe scientific corundum gems, however, never have these specific\r\ndefects. Hence the surest and simplest way of distinguishing between the\r\ntwo kinds of stones is to acquaint oneself with the typical defects of\r\nnatural corundum gems, and then to look for such defects in any specimen\r\nof ruby or sapphire that is in question.\r\n\r\nWhile a description of some of the most common of the typical defects of\r\nrubies and sapphires is to follow, the jeweler, who may not yet be\r\nfamiliar with them by actual experience, owes it to himself and to his\r\ncustomers to acquaint himself at first hand with the natural defects of\r\nsuch material, which he is always in a position to do through the\r\ncourtesy of representatives of houses dealing in precious stones, if he\r\nhimself does not carry such material in stock.\r\n\r\nTYPICAL DEFECTS OF NATURAL CORUNDUM GEMS. Perhaps the most common of the\r\ndefects of natural corundum gems is the peculiar appearance known as\r\n\"silk.\" This is best seen when a strong light is allowed to stream\r\nthrough the stone at right angles to the observer's line of sight. Sets\r\nof fine, _straight_, parallel lines will be seen, and these will\r\nfrequently meet other sets of similar lines at an angle of 120 degrees\r\n(like the angle at which the sides of a regular hexagon meet) or the\r\nlines may cross each other at that angle or at an angle of 60 degrees\r\n(the supplement of 120 degrees). Such _straight_ parallel lines are\r\nnever seen in scientific stones, and their presence may be taken to\r\nindicate positively that the stone having them is a natural stone. In\r\nfine specimens of natural ruby or sapphire such lines will be few and\r\ndifficult to find, but in some position or other they will usually be\r\nfound if the search is even as careful as that which one would\r\nhabitually employ in looking for defects in a diamond. In the vast\r\nmajority of cases no such careful search will be required to locate\r\n\"silk\" in natural rubies, and if a stone that is apparently a ruby is\r\nfree from such defects it is almost a foregone conclusion it is a\r\nscientific stone.\r\n\r\nAnother common type of defect in corundum gems is the occurrence of\r\npatches of milky cloudiness within the material. A little actual\r\nacquaintance with the appearance of this sort of defect in natural\r\nstones will make it easy to distinguish from the occasional cloudiness\r\nfound in scientific stones, which latter cloudiness is due to the\r\npresence of swarms of minute gas bubbles. These tiny bubbles can be seen\r\nunder a high power lens, and this suggests a third feature that may be\r\nused to tell whether one has a natural stone or not.\r\n\r\nNatural rubies and sapphires, like scientific ones, frequently contain\r\nbubbles, but these are always _angular_ in the natural stones, while\r\nthose of the scientific stones are generally _round_ or rounding, never\r\nangular.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the suggestions already presented it may be said that, since\r\nnatural and scientific corundum gems are composed of essentially the\r\nsame material, and have identically the same physical and chemical\r\nproperties, and frequently very closely resemble each other in color, it\r\nis necessary to have recourse to some other means of distinguishing\r\nbetween them. The best and simplest means for those who are acquainted\r\nwith the structural defects common to natural corundum gems is to seek\r\nfor such defects in any specimen that is in question, and if no such\r\ndefects can be found, to be very sceptical as to the naturalness of the\r\nspecimen, inasmuch as perfect corundum gems are very rare in nature, and\r\nwhen of fine color command exceedingly high prices. No jeweler can\r\nafford to risk his reputation for knowledge and for integrity by selling\r\nas a natural stone any gem which does not possess the minor defects\r\ncommon to practically all corundum gems.\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURAL DEFECTS OF SCIENTIFIC STONES. So far our tests have been\r\nmostly negative. It was said, however, that spherical bubbles sometimes\r\nappear in scientific gems. Another characteristic _structural_ defect of\r\npractically every scientific gem may be utilized to distinguish them. As\r\nis well known, the rough material is formed in boules or pear-shaped\r\ndrops under an inverted blowpipe. The powdered material is fed in with\r\none of the gases and passes through the flame, melting as it goes, and\r\nthen accumulating and crystallizing below as a boule. The top or head\r\nof this boule is rounding from the start, and hence the successive\r\nlayers of material gather in thin curved zones. The color and structure\r\nof these successive zones are not perfectly uniform, hence when cut\r\nstones are made from the boules these _curving_ parallel layers may be\r\nseen within by the use of a good lens, especially if the cut stone is\r\nheld in a strong crossing light, as was suggested when directions were\r\ngiven above as to the best way to look for \"silk\" in a natural stone.\r\n\r\nOwing to the shape of a well cut stone it is sometimes difficult to get\r\nlight through the material, yet by turning the stone repeatedly, some\r\nposition will be found in which the curving parallel striæ can be seen.\r\nThey are easily seen in scientific ruby, less easily in dark blue\r\nsapphire, but still they can be found on close search. In the light\r\ncolored stones and in white sapphire, the difficulty is greater, as\r\nthere are no color variations in the latter case. However, the value of\r\nwhite sapphire is so slight, whether natural or artificial, that it is a\r\nmatter of but little moment, and what has already been said as to\r\nnatural defects, applies to white sapphire as well as to the colored\r\nvarieties, and absolutely clear and perfect natural white sapphire is\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nOne more distinguishing mark of the scientific stones may be added to\r\ngive full measure to the scheme of separation, that no one need be\r\ndeceived.\r\n\r\nThe surface finish of the scientific stones is rarely as good as that of\r\nthe natural material and it appears to be more difficult to produce a\r\ngood polish on scientific stones than on natural ones. The degree of\r\nhardness of the scientific stones seems to be slightly variable in\r\ndifferent parts of the same piece so that the polishing material removes\r\nthe surface material unequally, leaving minute streaky marks on the\r\nsurfaces of the facets. Possibly this condition might be remedied by\r\nskillful treatment, but hardly at the price obtainable for the product,\r\nso that a close study of the surface finish will sometimes help in\r\ndistinguishing between natural and artificial material. Any fine\r\nspecimen of natural ruby or sapphire will have usually received very\r\nexpert treatment and a splendid surface finish.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, then, the points to be remembered in determining the\r\norigin of corundum gems are four in number.\r\n\r\n1. Expect to find natural defects, such as \"silk\" or cloudy patches, or\r\n_angular_ bubbles in all natural stones.\r\n\r\n2. If bubbles are present in artificial material they will be _round_ or\r\nrounding.\r\n\r\n3. Artificial material will always have _curving_ parallel striæ within\r\nit.\r\n\r\n4. The _surface finish_ of artificial material is seldom or never equal\r\nto that of natural material.\r\n\r\nIt ought not to be necessary to add that material from either source may\r\nbe cut to any shape, and that artificial rubies may be seen in most\r\nOriental garb, hence all specimens should have applied to them the above\r\ntests regardless of the seeming antiquity of their cut or of their\r\nalleged pedigree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVI\r\n\r\nHOW TO TEST AN \"UNKNOWN\" GEM\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now considered separately the principal physical properties by\r\nmeans of which one can identify a precious stone, let us attempt to give\r\nas good an idea as the printed page can convey of how one should go\r\nabout determining to what species a gem belongs.\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF WEAR IN AN EMERALD. To make the matter more concrete, and\r\ntherefore more interesting, let us consider a real case, the most recent\r\nproblem, in fact, that the author has had to solve. A lady of some\r\nwealth had purchased, for a large sum, a green stone which purported to\r\nbe an emerald. After a few years of wear as a ring stone she noticed one\r\nday that the stone had dulled around the edges of its table, and\r\nthinking that that ought not to be the case with a real emerald, she\r\nappealed to a dealer in diamonds to know if her stone was a real\r\nemerald. The diamond merchant told her frankly that, while he was\r\ncompetent in all matters pertaining to diamonds, he could not be sure of\r\nhimself regarding colored stones, and advised the lady to see the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nThe matter being thus introduced, the lady was at once informed that\r\neven a real emerald might show signs of wear after a few years of the\r\nhard use that comes to a ring stone.\r\n\r\nWhile emerald has, as we saw in the lesson on hardness, a degree of\r\nhardness rated as nearly 8 (7-1/2 in the table), it is nevertheless a\r\nrather brittle material and the long series of tiny blows that a ring\r\nstone is bound to meet with will cause minute yielding along the exposed\r\nedges and corners of the top facets. This being announced, the first\r\nstep in the examination of the stone was to clean it and to give it a\r\ncareful examination with a ten-power lens. (An aplanatic triplet will\r\nbe found best for this purpose.)\r\n\r\nCOLOR. The color was, of course, the most obvious property, but, as has\r\nalready been said, color is not to be relied upon in all cases. In this\r\ncase the color was a good emerald green but a bit bluer than the finest\r\ngrass green. A very fine Maine tourmaline might approach this stone in\r\ncolor, so it became necessary to consider this possibility. A glass\r\nimitation, too, might have a color equal or superior to this.\r\n\r\nIMPERFECTIONS. While noting the color, the imperfections of the stone\r\nclaimed attention. They consisted mainly of minute jagged cracks of the\r\ncharacter peculiar to brittle materials such as both emerald and\r\ntourmaline. So far it will be noted either of the above minerals might\r\nhave furnished the lady's gem. As glass can be artificially crackled to\r\nproduce similar flaws the stone might have been only an imitation as far\r\nas anything yet learned about it goes.\r\n\r\nFILE TEST. The next step was to test its hardness by gently applying a\r\nvery fine file to an exposed point at one corner of the girdle. The file\r\nslipped on the material as a skate slips on ice. Evidently we did not\r\nhave to do with a glass imitation.\r\n\r\nREFRACTION. Knowing now that we had a true hard mineral, it remained to\r\nbe determined what mineral it was. On holding the stone in direct\r\nsunlight and reflecting the light onto a white card it was seen at once\r\nthat the material was doubly refracting, for a series of _double_ images\r\nof the back facets appeared. These double images might have been\r\nproduced by tourmaline as well as by emerald. (Not however by glass\r\nwhich is singly refracting.) If a direct reading refractometer had been\r\navailable the matter could have been settled at once by reading the\r\nrefractive indices of the material, for tourmaline and emerald have not\r\nonly different refractive indices but have double refraction to\r\ndifferent degrees. Such an instrument was not available at the time and\r\nwill hardly be available to most of those who are studying this lesson,\r\nso we can go on with our account of the further testing of the green\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nHARDNESS. A test upon the surface of a quartz crystal showed that the\r\nstone was harder than quartz (but so is tourmaline). A true topaz\r\ncrystal was too hard for the ring stone, whose edge slipped over the\r\nsmooth topaz surface. The green stone was therefore not a green corundum\r\n(Oriental emerald) as the latter has hardness 9 and scratches topaz.\r\n\r\nWith hardness evidently between 7 and 8 and with double refraction and\r\nwith the kind of flaws peculiar to rather brittle minerals we had in all\r\nprobability either a tourmaline or an emerald.\r\n\r\nDICHROISM. The dichroscope (which might have been used much earlier in\r\nthe test but was not at hand at the time) was next tried and the stone\r\nwas seen to have marked dichroism--a bluish green and a yellowish green\r\nappearing in the two squares of the instrument when the stone was held\r\nin front of the opening and viewed against a strong light.\r\n\r\nAs either tourmaline or emerald might thus exhibit dichroism (the\r\ntourmaline more strongly, however, than the emerald) one more test was\r\ntried to finally decide the matter.\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC GRAVITY. The stone was removed from its setting and two\r\nspecific gravity determinations made by means of a specific gravity\r\nbottle and a fine chemical balance. The two results, which came closely\r\nalike, averaged 2.70 which agrees very nearly with emerald (2.74) and\r\nwhich is far removed from the specific gravity of tourmaline (3.10). The\r\nstone was now _definitely known_ to be an emerald, as each of several\r\ntests agreed with the properties of emerald, namely:\r\n\r\n    Color--nearly grass green.\r\n\r\n    Imperfections--like those of emerald.\r\n\r\n    Hardness--7-1/2.\r\n\r\n    Refraction--double.\r\n\r\n    Dichroism--easily noted.\r\n\r\n    Specific gravity--2.70.\r\n\r\nWhile one who was accustomed to deal in fine emeralds might not need to\r\nmake as detailed an examination of the stone as has just been indicated\r\nabove, yet for most of us who do not have many opportunities of studying\r\nvaluable emeralds it is safer to make sure by complete tests.\r\n\r\nOne other concrete example of how to go about testing unknown stones\r\nmust suffice to conclude this lesson, after which the student, who has\r\nmastered the separate lessons preceding this, should proceed to test as\r\nmany \"unknowns\" as his time and industry permit in order to really make\r\n_his own_ the matter of these lessons. It may be added here that the\r\ntask of testing a stone is much more rapid than this laborious effort to\r\nteach others how to do it might indicate. To one skilled in these\r\nmatters only a few seconds are required for the inspection of a stone\r\nwith the lens, the dichroscope, or the refractometer, and hardness\r\ntests are swiftly made. A specific gravity test requires more time and\r\nshould be resorted to only when there remains a reasonable doubt after\r\nother tests have been applied.\r\n\r\nNow for our final example. A red stone, cut in the form of a pear-shaped\r\nbrilliant, was submitted to the writer for determination. It had been\r\nacquired by an American gentleman in Japan from an East Indian who was\r\nin financial straits. Along with it, as security for a loan, the\r\nAmerican obtained a number of smaller red stones, a bluish stone, and a\r\nlarger red stone. The red stones were all supposed to be rubies. On\r\nexamination of the larger red stone with a lens it was at once noted\r\nthat the internal structure was that of _scientific ruby_.\r\n\r\nTESTING OTHER STONES. Somewhat dashed by the announcement of this\r\ndiscovery the owner began to fear that all his gems were false.\r\nExamination of the small red stones showed abundance of \"silk,\" a\r\npeculiar fibrous appearance within the stone caused by its internal\r\nstructure. The fibers were _straight_ and _parallel_, not _curved_ and\r\n_parallel_ as in synthetic ruby. Tiny bubbles of angular shape also\r\nindicated that the small stones were natural rubies. They exhibited\r\ndichroism and scratched topaz and it was therefore decided that they at\r\nleast were genuine.\r\n\r\nThe pear-shaped brilliant which was first mentioned was of a peculiar,\r\nslightly yellowish, red color. It was very pellucid and free from any\r\nstriæ either of the straight or curved types. It had in fact no flaws\r\nexcept a rather large nick on one of the back surfaces near the girdle.\r\nThis was not in evidence from the front of the stone and had evidently\r\nbeen left by the Oriental gem cutter to avoid loss in weight while\r\ncutting the stone.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar yellowish character of the red color led us to suspect ruby\r\nspinel. The stone was therefore inspected with the dichroscope and\r\nfound to possess no dichroism. The sunlight-card test, too, showed that\r\nthe stone was singly refracting.\r\n\r\nA test of the hardness showed that the material barely scratched topaz,\r\nbut was attacked by sapphire. It was therefore judged to be a red\r\nspinel.\r\n\r\nThe large bluish stone which the gentleman acquired with the red stones\r\nproved to be iolite, sometimes called cordierite or water-sapphire\r\n(_Saphir d'eau_), a stone seldom seen in this country. It had marked\r\ndichroism--showing a smoky blue color in one direction and a yellowish\r\nwhite in another. The difference was so marked as to be easily seen\r\nwithout the dichroscope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVII\r\n\r\nSUITABILITY OF STONES FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF JEWELS, AS DETERMINED BY\r\nHARDNESS, BRITTLENESS, AND CLEAVABILITY\r\n\r\n\r\nHARD STONES NOT NECESSARILY TOUGH. As was suggested in the lesson on\r\nhardness there is prevalent in the public mind an erroneous belief that\r\nhardness carries with it ability to resist blows as well as abrasion.\r\nNow that _it does not follow that because a precious stone is very hard,\r\nit will wear well_, should be made plain. Some rather hard minerals are\r\nseldom or never used as gems, in spite of considerable beauty and\r\nhardness, because of their great brittleness. Other stones, while fairly\r\nhard and reasonably tough in certain directions, have nevertheless so\r\npronounced a cleavage that they do not wear well if cut, and are\r\nsometimes very difficult to cut at all.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts it will be well to consider briefly what stones,\r\namong those most in use, are sufficiently tough as well as hard, to give\r\ngood service in jewels, such as rings, which are subject to rough wear.\r\nWe may also consider those stones, whose softness, or brittleness, or\r\nready cleavability, requires that they should be reserved for use only\r\nin those jewels which, because of their nature, receive less rough\r\nusage.\r\n\r\nIn order to deal with the principal gems systematically, let us consider\r\nthem in the order of their hardness, beginning with the hardest gem\r\nmaterial known, which is, of course, diamond.\r\n\r\nDURABILITY OF THE DIAMOND. Fortunately this king of gems possesses in\r\naddition to its great hardness, considerable toughness, and although it\r\nis readily cleavable in certain directions it nevertheless requires a\r\nnotable amount of force applied in a particular direction to cause it to\r\ncleave. Although sharp knocks will occasionally flake off thin layers\r\nfrom diamonds when roughly worn in rings, or even in extreme cases\r\nfracture them, yet this happens but seldom and, as the enormous use of\r\nthe diamond in ring mountings proves, it is entirely suitable for that\r\npurpose. It follows that, if a stone can stand ring usage, it can safely\r\nbe used for any purpose for which precious stones are mounted.\r\n\r\nTHE CORUNDUM GEMS. Next after the diamond in hardness come the corundum\r\ngems, _i. e._, ruby, sapphire, and the series of corundum gems of colors\r\nother than red and blue. These stones have no noticeable cleavage and\r\nare exceedingly tough, for minerals, as well as very hard. We have only\r\nto consider the use of impure corundum (emery) as a commercial abrasive\r\nin emery wheels, emery cloth, emery paper, etc., to see that the\r\nmaterial is tough. Any of the corundum gems therefore may be used in any\r\ntype of jewel without undue risk of wear or breakage. Customers of\r\njewelers should, however, be cautioned against wearing ruby or sapphire\r\nrings on the same finger with a diamond ring in cases where it would be\r\npossible for the two stones to rub against each other. So much harder\r\nthan the ruby is the diamond (in spite of the seeming closeness of\r\nposition in Mohs's scale) that the slightest touch upon a ruby surface\r\nwith a diamond will produce a pronounced scratch. The possessor of\r\ndiamonds and other stones should also be cautioned against keeping them\r\nloose in the same jewel case or other container, as the shaking together\r\nmay result in the scratching of the softer materials. The Arabs are said\r\nto have a legend to the effect that the diamond is an _angry_ stone and\r\nthat it should not be allowed to associate with other stones lest it\r\nscratch them.\r\n\r\nCHRYSOBERYL. Passing on to the next mineral in the scale of hardness we\r\ncome to chrysoberyl, which is rated as 8-1/2 on Mohs's scale. This\r\nmineral furnishes us the gem, alexandrite, which is notable for its\r\npower to change in color from green in daylight to red in artificial\r\nlight. Chrysoberyl also supplies the finest cat's-eyes (when the\r\nmaterial is of a sufficiently fibrous or tubular structure), and it\r\nfurther supplies the greenish-yellow stones frequently (though\r\nincorrectly) called \"chrysolite\" by jewelers. The material is very hard\r\nand reasonably tough and may be used in almost any suitable mounting.\r\n\r\nSPINEL. After chrysoberyl come the materials rated as about 8 in\r\nhardness. First and hardest of these is spinel, then comes true or\r\nprecious topaz. The various spinels are very hard and tough stones. The\r\nrough material persists in turbulent mountain streams where weaker\r\nminerals are ground to powder, and when cut and polished, spinel will\r\nwear well in any jewel. The author has long worn a ruby spinel in a ring\r\non the right hand and has done many things that have subjected it to\r\nhard knocks, yet it is still intact, except for a spot that accidentally\r\ncame in contact with a fast-flying carborundum wheel, which of course\r\nabraded the spinel.\r\n\r\nTOPAZ. The true topaz is a bit softer than spinel, and the rough\r\ncrystals show a very perfect basal cleavage. That is, they will cleave\r\nin a plane parallel to the bases of the usual orthorhombic crystals.\r\nThis being the case a cut topaz is very likely to be damaged by a blow\r\nor even by being dropped on a hard surface, and it would be wiser not to\r\nset such a stone in a ring unless it was to be but little used, or used\r\nby one who would not engage in rough work while wearing it. Thus a lady\r\nmight wear a topaz ring on dress occasions for a long time without\r\ndamaging it, but it would not do for a machinist to wear one in a ring.\r\n\r\nGEMS BETWEEN 7 AND 8 IN HARDNESS. We now come to a rather long list of\r\ngem minerals ranging between 7 and 8 in hardness. Of these the principal\r\nones are zircon, almandine garnet, and beryl (emerald and aquamarine)\r\nrated as 7-1/2 in hardness, and pyrope and hessonite garnet rated as\r\n7-1/4 in hardness. Tourmaline and kunzite may also be included in this\r\ngroup as being on the average slightly above 7 in hardness.\r\n\r\nThe above minerals are all harder than quartz, and hence not subject to\r\nabrasion by the quartz dust which is everywhere present. In this respect\r\nthey are suitable for fairly hard wear. The garnets are of sufficient\r\ntoughness so that they may be freely used in rings--and the extensive\r\nuse of thin slices of garnet to top doublets proves the suitability of\r\nthe material for resisting wear. The zircon is rather more brittle and\r\nthe artificially whitened zircons (known as jargoons) are especially\r\nsubject to breakage when worn in rings. Fortunately jargoons are not\r\ncommonly sold.\r\n\r\nThe beryl, whether emerald or aquamarine, is rather brittle. Emeralds\r\nare seldom found in river gravels. The material cannot persist in the\r\nmountain streams that bring down other and tougher minerals. The extreme\r\nbeauty and value of the emerald has led to its use in the finest\r\njewels, and the temptation is strong to set it in rings, especially in\r\nrings for ladies. If such rings are worn with the care that valuable\r\njewels should receive they will probably last a long time without any\r\nmore serious damage than the dulling of the sharp edges of the facets\r\naround the table. This slight damage can at any time be repaired by a\r\nlight repolishing of the affected facets. If an emerald is already badly\r\nshattered, or as it is called \"mossy\" in character, it will not be wise\r\nto set it in a ring, as a slight shock might complete its fracture. What\r\nhas been said about emerald applies equally to aquamarine except that\r\nthe value at stake is much less and the material is usually much freer\r\nfrom cracks.\r\n\r\nTourmalines, like emeralds, are brittle, and should be treated\r\naccordingly. Here, however, we are dealing with a much less expensive\r\nmaterial than emerald, and if a customer desires a tourmaline in a ring\r\nmounting, while it will be best to suggest care in wearing it, the\r\nloss, in case of breakage, will usually be slight.\r\n\r\nKunzite, like all spodumene, has a pronounced cleavage. It should\r\ntherefore be used in brooches, pendants, and such jewels, rather than in\r\nrings. Lapidaries dislike to cut it under some conditions because of its\r\nfragility.\r\n\r\nQUARTZ GEMS. Coming down to hardness 7 we have the various quartz gems\r\nand jade (variety jadeite). The principal quartz gems are, of course,\r\namethyst and citrine quartz (the stone that is almost universally called\r\ntopaz in the trade). As crystalline quartz is fairly tough and lacks any\r\npronounced cleavage, and as it is as hard as anything it is likely to\r\nmeet with in use, it is a durable stone in rings or in other mountings.\r\nIn the course of time the sharp edges will wear dull from friction with\r\nobjects carrying common dust, which is largely composed of powdered\r\nquartz itself, and which therefore gradually dulls a quartz gem. Old\r\namethysts or \"topazes\" that have been long in use in rings show this\r\ndulling. There is, however, little danger of fracture with amethyst or\r\n\"topaz\" unless the blow is severe and then any stone might yield.\r\n\r\nThe many semi-precious stones which have a quartz basis (such as the\r\nvarieties of waxy or cryptocrystalline chalcedony which is largely\r\nquartz in a very minutely crystalline condition) are often even tougher\r\nthan the clear crystallized quartz. Carnelian, agate, quartz cat's-eye,\r\njasper (containing earthy impurities), and those materials in which\r\nquartz has more or less completely replaced other substances, such as\r\nsilicified crocidolite, petrified wood, chrysocolla quartz, etc., are\r\nall nearly as hard and quite as tough as quartz itself, and they make\r\nadmirable stones for inexpensive rings of the arts and crafts type.\r\n\r\nJADE. Jade, of the jadeite variety, which is rarer than the nephrite\r\njade, and more highly regarded by the Chinese, is an exceedingly tough\r\nmaterial. One can beat a chunk of the rough material with a hammer\r\nwithout making much impression upon it. It is also fairly hard, about as\r\nhard as quartz, and with the two properties of toughness and hardness it\r\npossesses excellent wearing qualities in any kind of mounting. True\r\njade, whether jadeite or nephrite, deserves a larger use in inexpensive\r\nornaments, as it may be had of very fine green color and it is\r\ninexpensive and durable.\r\n\r\nSOFTER STONES. Coming next to those minerals whose hardness is 6 or\r\nover, but less than 7, we have to consider jade of the nephrite variety,\r\ndemantoid garnet (\"olivine\" of the trade), peridot (or chrysolite, or\r\nthe olivine of the mineralogist), turquoise, moonstone, and opal.\r\n\r\nAs has already been said of jadeite, the jade of the nephrite variety,\r\nwhile slightly less hard, is about as tough a mineral as one could\r\nexpect to find. It can take care of itself in any situation.\r\n\r\nThe demantoid garnet (the \"olivine\" of the trade) is so beautiful and\r\nbrilliant a stone that it is a pity that it is so lacking in hardness.\r\nIt will do very well for mounting in such jewels as scarf pins,\r\nlavallières, etc., where but little hard wear is met with, but it cannot\r\nbe recommended for hard ring use.\r\n\r\nThe peridot, too, is rather soft for ring use and will last much better\r\nin scarf pins or other mountings little subject to rubbing or to shocks.\r\n\r\nTurquoise, although rather soft, is fairly tough, as its waxy luster\r\nmight make one suppose, and in addition, being an opaque stone, slight\r\ndulling or scratching hardly lessens its beauty. It may therefore be\r\nused in ring mountings. However, it should be suggested that most\r\nturquoise is sufficiently porous to absorb grease, oil, or other\r\nliquids, and its color is frequently ruined thereby. Of course, such a\r\nchange is far more likely to occur to a ring stone than to a turquoise\r\nmounted in some more protected situation.\r\n\r\nThe moonstone, being a variety of feldspar, has the pronounced cleavage\r\nof that mineral and will not stand blows without exhibiting this\r\nproperty. Moonstones are therefore better suited to the less rude\r\nservice in brooch mountings, etc., than to that of ring stones. However,\r\nbeing comparatively inexpensive, many moonstones, especially of the\r\nchoicer bluish type, are set in ring mountings. The lack of hardness may\r\nbe expected to dull their surfaces in time even though no shock starts a\r\ncleavage.\r\n\r\nTHE OPAL. There remains the opal, of hardness 6, to be considered. As is\r\nwell known opal is a solidified jelly of siliceous composition,\r\ncontaining also combined water. It is not only soft but very brittle and\r\nit will crack very easily. Many opals crack in the paper in which they\r\nare sold, perhaps because of unequal expansion or contraction, due to\r\nheat or cold. In spite of this fragility, thousands of fine opals, and a\r\nhost of commoner ones, are set in rings, where many of them\r\nsubsequently come to a violent end, and all, sooner or later, become\r\ndulled and require repolishing.\r\n\r\nThe great beauty of the opal, rivaling any mineral in its color-play,\r\ncauses us to chance the risk of damage in order to mount it where its\r\nvivid hues may be advantageously viewed by the wearer as well as by\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nVERY SOFT STONES. Of stones softer than 6 we have but few and none of\r\nthem is really fit for hard service. Lapis lazuli, 5-1/2 in hardness,\r\nhas a beautiful blue color, frequently flecked with white or with bits\r\nof fool's gold. Its surface soon becomes dulled by hard wear.\r\n\r\nTwo more of the softer materials, malachite and azurite, remain to be\r\ndescribed. These are both varieties of copper carbonate with combined\r\nwater, the azurite having less water. Both take a good polish, but fail\r\nto retain it in use, being only of hardness 3-1/2 to 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVIII\r\n\r\nMINERAL SPECIES TO WHICH THE VARIOUS GEMS BELONG AND THE CHEMICAL\r\nCOMPOSITION THEREOF\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we have a very large number of different kinds of precious and\r\nsemi-precious stones, to judge by the long list of names to be found in\r\nbooks on gems, yet all these stones can be rather simply classified on\r\nthe basis of their chemical composition, into one or another of a\r\ncomparatively small number of mineral species. While jewelers seldom\r\nmake use of a knowledge of the chemistry of the precious stones in\r\nidentifying them, nevertheless such a knowledge is useful, both by way\r\nof information, and because it leads to a better and clearer\r\nunderstanding of the many similarities among stones whose color might\r\nlead one to regard them as dissimilar.\r\n\r\nMINERAL SPECIES. We must first consider what is meant by a \"mineral\r\nspecies\" and find out what relation exists between that subject and\r\nchemical composition. Now by a \"mineral species\" is understood a single\r\nsubstance, having (except for mechanically admixed impurities)\r\npractically a constant chemical composition, and having practically\r\nidentical physical properties in all specimens of it.\r\n\r\nDIAMOND AND CORUNDUM. A chemist would call a true mineral a _pure\r\nsubstance_, just as sugar and salt are pure substances to the chemist.\r\nThus _diamond_ is a \"mineral species,\" as is also _corundum_. There are\r\nmany different colors of both diamond and corundum, but these different\r\ncolors are believed to be due to the presence in the pure substance of\r\nimpurities in small amounts. Thus every diamond consists mainly of pure\r\ncarbon, and all the corundum gems (_ruby_ and the various colors of\r\n_sapphire_) consist mainly of pure oxide of aluminum. The properties of\r\nall diamonds are practically alike and so are the properties of all the\r\ncorundum gems whether red (ruby), blue (sapphire), yellow (Oriental\r\ntopaz), green (Oriental emerald), or purple (Oriental amethyst).\r\n\r\nThus all diamonds, of whatever color, belong to the one species,\r\ndiamond, and in this case the usual custom in naming them agrees with\r\nthe facts. Similarly all sapphires, of whatever color, belong to the\r\nmineral species \"corundum.\" Thus a ruby is a red corundum.\r\n\r\nThe old French traveler and gem merchant, Tavernier, tells us that in\r\nthe seventeenth century, when he visited the mines of Pegu, the natives\r\nknew of the similarity of the corundum gems and even called all by one\r\nname, with other names attached to designate the color. Singularly\r\nenough, the common name used by them was _ruby_ rather than sapphire, as\r\nnow. Thus they called blue corundum gems blue rubies; yellow corundums,\r\nyellow rubies, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is easily seen that if one recognizes the similar nature of all the\r\nmany colors and shades of corundum that the number of things that one\r\nhas to remember in order to be well acquainted with these stones is\r\nconsiderably diminished. Thus, instead of having a whole series of\r\nspecific gravities to remember one has only to remember that all the\r\ncorundum gems have a specific gravity of approximately 4. Similarly they\r\nare all of practically the same refractive index (1.761-1.770, being\r\ndoubly refracting) that they all exhibit dichroism when at all deeply\r\ncolored, etc.\r\n\r\nHaving thus indicated what we mean by mineral species and having\r\nillustrated the matter by the cases of diamond and corundum and further\r\nhaving stated that all diamonds are composed of pure carbon (except for\r\ntraces of impurities) and all corundum gems mainly of oxide of aluminum,\r\nwe may proceed to consider other mineral species and find out what gems\r\nthey afford us.\r\n\r\nCARBON, THE ONLY ELEMENT FURNISHING A GEM. It will be noted that the\r\nfirst species considered, diamond, consisted of but a single element,\r\ncarbon. It is thus exceedingly simple in composition, being not only a\r\npure substance but, in addition, an elementary substance. CORUNDUM, the\r\nsecond species considered, was a little more complex, having two\r\nelements, aluminum and oxygen, in its make-up, but completely and\r\ndefinitely combined in a new compound that resembles neither aluminum\r\nnor oxygen. It is thus a compound substance. No other element than\r\ncarbon affords any gem-stone when by itself.\r\n\r\nOXIDES OF METALS. There is, however, another oxide, in addition to\r\naluminum oxide, that furnishes gem material. It is _silicon oxide_,\r\ncontaining the two elements silicon and oxygen. Silicon itself is a\r\ndark, gray, crystalline element that seems half metallic, half\r\nnon-metallic in its properties. It is never found by itself in nature\r\nbut about twenty-eight per cent. of the crust of the earth is composed\r\nof it in compound forms, and one of the most abundant of these is\r\nQUARTZ, which is a mineral species, and which contains just silicon and\r\noxygen. That is, it is oxide of silicon. Now quartz is colorless when\r\npure (_rock crystal_), but it is frequently found colored purple\r\n(probably by oxide of manganese) and it is then called _amethyst_ by the\r\njeweler. At other times its color is yellow (due to oxide of iron) and\r\nthen the jeweler is prone to call it \"_topaz_,\" although properly\r\nspeaking that name should, as we shall soon see, be reserved for an\r\nentirely different mineral species. _Chalcedony_ too (which when banded\r\nfurnishes us our _agates_, and when reddish our _carnelian_) is a\r\nvariety of quartz, and _prase_ is only quartz colored green by fibers of\r\nactinolite within it.\r\n\r\nThe common _cat's-eye_ and the _tiger's-eye_ are varieties of quartz\r\nenclosing fibrous minerals or replacing them while still keeping the\r\narrangement that they had. \"_Venus hair stone_\" is quartz containing\r\nneedle-like crystals of rutile, and \"_iris_\" is quartz that has been\r\ncrackled within, so as to produce rainbow colors, because of the\r\neffects of thin layers of material. _Aventurine quartz_ (sometimes\r\ncalled goldstone) has spangles of mica or of some other mineral enclosed\r\nin it. The _jaspers_ are mainly quartz with more of earthy impurity than\r\nthe preceding stones.\r\n\r\nThus all this long list of stones of differing names can be classified\r\nunder the one mineral species, quartz. Together they constitute the\r\nquartz gems. In properties they are essentially alike, having specific\r\ngravity 2.66, hardness 7, slight double refraction, etc., the slight\r\ndifferences that exist being due only to the presence of varying amounts\r\nof foreign matter.\r\n\r\nOPAL. The _opal_ may be considered along with the quartz gems, because,\r\nlike them, it is composed mainly of oxide of silicon, but the opal also\r\nhas water combined with the silicon oxide (not merely imprisoned in it).\r\nThus opal is a hydrous form of silica (hydrous comes from the Greek word\r\nfor water).\r\n\r\nSPINEL. All our other stones are of more complicated chemical\r\ncomposition than the preceding. Coming now to mineral species which have\r\nthree chemical elements in them we may consider first _spinel_, which\r\nhas the two metallic elements aluminum and magnesium and the\r\nnon-metallic element oxygen in it. It is virtually a compound of the two\r\noxides, aluminum oxide and magnesium oxide. The variously colored\r\nspinels, like the various corundums, all have the same properties, thus\r\nthey are all of hardness 8 or a little higher, they all have single\r\nrefraction, and all have specific gravity 3.60.\r\n\r\nCHRYSOBERYL. Another mineral species which, like spinel, has just three\r\nelements in its composition is _chrysoberyl_. This mineral contains the\r\nmetals aluminum and beryllium combined with the non-metal oxygen. Thus\r\nit is really to be regarded as a compound of the two oxides, aluminum\r\noxide and beryllium oxide. This species furnishes us _Alexandrite_,\r\n_chrysoberyl cat's-eye_ and less valuable chrysoberyls of\r\nyellowish-green color. All are of the one species, the marked color\r\ndifference being due to the presence of different impurities. The\r\ncat's-eye effect in one of the varieties is due to the internal\r\nstructure rather than to the nature of the material.\r\n\r\nTHE SILICATES. Nearly all of the remaining precious stones belong to a\r\ngreat group of mineral species known as the silicates. These are so\r\ncalled because they consist largely of oxide of silicon (the material\r\nabove referred to under quartz gems). This oxide of silicon is not free\r\nand separate in the silicates but is combined chemically with other\r\noxides, chiefly with metallic oxides. Thus there are many different\r\nsilicates because, in the earth, many different metallic oxides have\r\ncombined with silicon oxide. Also in many cases two or three or even\r\nmore metallic oxides have combined with silicon oxide to make single new\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\nGLASS, A MIXTURE OF SILICATES. Those who are familiar with glass making\r\nmay receive some help at this point by remembering that the various\r\nglasses are silicates, for they are made by melting sand (which is\r\nnearly pure oxide of silicon) with various metallic oxides. With lime\r\n(calcium oxide) and soda (which yields sodium oxide) we get soda-lime\r\nglass (common window glass). Lead oxide being added to the mixture a\r\ndense, very brilliant, but soft glass (flint glass) results. Cut glass\r\ndishes and \"paste\" gems are made of this flint glass. Now the glasses,\r\nalthough they are silicates, are not crystalline, but rather they are\r\n_amorphous_, that is, without any definite structure. Nature's\r\nsilicates, on the other hand, are usually crystallized or at least\r\ncrystalline in structure. (In a few cases we find true glasses, volcanic\r\nglass, or obsidian, for example.)\r\n\r\nHaving thus introduced the silicates we may now consider which ones\r\namong the many mineral silicates furnish us with precious or\r\nsemi-precious stones.\r\n\r\nBERYL, EMERALD, AND AQUAMARINE. First in value among the silicates is\r\n_beryl_, which, when grass green, we call _emerald_. The _aquamarine_\r\nand _golden beryl_ too belong to this same species. Beryl is a silicate\r\nof aluminum and beryllium. That is, it is a compound in which oxide of\r\nsilicon is united with the oxides of aluminum and of beryllium. There\r\nare thus four chemical elements combined in the one substance and it is\r\nhence more complicated in its composition than any of the gems that we\r\nhave yet considered. It is worthy of note that aluminum occurs in the\r\nmajority of precious stones, the only species so far considered that\r\nlack it being diamond, and the quartz gems.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the silicates that are next in importance to the jeweler, after\r\nberyl, are those which form the _garnets_ of various types. There are\r\nfour principal varieties of garnet (although specimens of garnet\r\nfrequently show a crossing or blending of the types).\r\n\r\nGARNETS. The types are (1) _Almandite_ garnet; (2) _Pyrope_ garnet; (3)\r\n_Hessonite_ garnet; and (4) _Andradite_ garnet. These are all silicates,\r\nthe almandite garnets being silicates of iron and aluminum; the pyrope\r\ngarnets are silicates of magnesium and aluminum; the hessonite garnets,\r\nsilicates of calcium and aluminum, and the andradite garnets, silicates\r\nof calcium and iron.\r\n\r\nThe so-called almandine garnets of the jeweler are frequently of the\r\nalmandite class and tend to purplish red. The pyrope garnets are, as the\r\nname literally implies, of fire red color, as a rule, but they also may\r\nbe purplish in color. The hessonite garnets are frequently brownish red\r\nand are sometimes called \"cinnamon stones.\" The andradite garnets\r\nfurnish the brilliant, nearly emerald green demantoids (so often called\r\n\"_olivine_\" by the trade).\r\n\r\nThus all the garnets are silicates and yet we have these four principal\r\nmineral species, which, however, are more closely related to each other\r\nin crystal form, in character of composition and in general properties,\r\nthan is usual among the other silicates. Specimens which have any one of\r\nthe four types of composition unblended with any of the other types\r\nwould be found to be exactly alike in properties. As was suggested\r\nabove, however, there is a great tendency to blend and this is well\r\nillustrated by the magnificent _rhodolite_ garnets, of rhododendron hue\r\nwhich were found in Macon County, North Carolina. These had a\r\ncomposition between almandite and pyrope, that is, they had both\r\nmagnesium and iron with aluminum and silica.\r\n\r\nThe true TOPAZ next calls for consideration as it too is a silicate. The\r\nmetallic part consists of aluminum, and there are present also the\r\nnon-metals fluorine and hydrogen. Here we have five elements in the one\r\nsubstance. Various specimens of this species may be wine yellow, light\r\nblue, or bluish green, pink or colorless, yet they all have essentially\r\nthe same properties.\r\n\r\nTOURMALINE is about as complicated a mineral as we have. It is a very\r\ncomplex silicate, containing aluminum, magnesium, sodium (or other\r\nalkali metal, as, for example, lithium), iron, boron, and hydrogen. As\r\nRuskin says of it in his _The Ethics of the Dust_, when Mary asks \"and\r\nwhat is it made of?\" \"A little of everything; there's always flint\r\n(silica) and clay (alumina) and magnesia in it and the black is iron,\r\naccording to its fancy; and there's boracic acid, if you know what that\r\nis: and if you don't, I cannot tell you to-day and it doesn't signify;\r\nand there's potash and soda; and on the whole, the chemistry of it is\r\nmore like a mediæval doctor's prescription, than the making of a\r\nrespectable mineral.\" The various tourmalines very closely resemble each\r\nother in their properties, the slight differences corresponding to\r\ndifferences in composition do not alter the general nature of the\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nMOONSTONE belongs to a species of mineral known as feldspar. The\r\nparticular feldspar that furnishes most of the moonstone is orthoclase,\r\na silicate of potassium and aluminum. Another feldspar sometimes seen as\r\na semi-precious stone is _Labradorite_. _Amazonite_, also, is a\r\nfeldspar. _Sunstone_ is a feldspar which includes tiny flakes or\r\nspangles of some other mineral.\r\n\r\nThe mineral species _olivine_ gives us _peridot_. It is a silicate of\r\nmagnesium.\r\n\r\nZIRCON is itself a species of mineral and is a silicate of zirconium.\r\nThe names _hyacinth_, _jacinth_, and _jargoon_ are applied to red,\r\nyellow, and colorless zircon in the order as given.\r\n\r\nJADE may be of any of several different species of minerals, all of\r\nwhich are very tough. The principal jades belong, however, to one or the\r\nother of two species, _jadeite_ and _nephrite_. Jadeite is a sodium\r\naluminum silicate and nephrite, a calcium magnesium silicate.\r\n\r\nLeaving the silicates we find very few gem minerals remaining. The\r\nphosphates furnish us _turquoise_, a hydrous aluminum phosphate, with\r\ncopper and iron. _Variscite_ is also a phosphate (a hydrated aluminum\r\nphosphate).\r\n\r\nThe carbonates give us _malachite_ and _azurite_, both carbonates of\r\ncopper with combined water, the malachite having more water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIX\r\n\r\nTHE NAMING OF PRECIOUS STONES\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to the confusion which may result from a lack of uniformity in the\r\nnaming of precious stones, it is very desirable that jewelers and stone\r\nmerchants inform themselves in regard to the correct use of the names of\r\nthe gems, and that they use care in speaking and in writing such names.\r\n\r\nAs nearly all precious and semi-precious stones are derived from a\r\nrelatively small number of _mineral species_, as we saw in Lesson\r\nXVIII., and as the science of _mineralogy_ has a very orderly and\r\nsystematic method of naming the minerals, the best results are had in\r\nthe naming of gems when we use, as far as is possible, the language of\r\nmineralogy.\r\n\r\nANCIENT USAGE. Long established custom and usage, however, must be\r\nobserved, for any system of naming must be generally understood in order\r\nto be useful. Thus the proper name for blood red, crystallized oxide of\r\naluminum, of gem quality, according to the mineralogical system of\r\nnaming, would be red _corundum_, but that same material is referred to\r\nin the Old Testament thus (in speaking of wisdom), \"She is more precious\r\nthan _rubies_.\" It is obviously necessary to keep and to use all such\r\nterms as have been for years established in usage, even though they do\r\nnot agree with the scientific method of naming the particular mineral.\r\nIt is, however, necessary that any name, thus retained, should be\r\ncorrectly used, and that it should not be applied to more than one\r\nmaterial. Thus the term _ruby_ should be reserved exclusively for red\r\ncorundum, and not applied to other red minerals such as garnet, spinel,\r\netc., as is too often done.\r\n\r\nIt will be the purpose of this lesson to attempt to set forth as clearly\r\nand as briefly as possible what constitutes good usage in the naming of\r\nthe principal stones, and also to point out what incorrect usage is most\r\nin need of being avoided.\r\n\r\nTo cover the subject systematically we will adopt the order of hardness\r\nthat we did in discussing mineral species in Lesson XVIII.\r\n\r\nFANCY DIAMONDS. Beginning with the hardest of all gems, the _diamond_,\r\nwe have no difficulty as regards naming, as all specimens of this\r\nmineral, regardless of color, are called diamonds. When it is necessary\r\nto designate particular colors or tints, or differences in tint,\r\nadditional names are used--for example, all diamonds of pronounced and\r\npleasing color are called \"fancy\" diamonds in the trade. Certain of\r\nthese \"fancy\" diamonds are still further defined by using a name\r\nspecifying the color, as, for example, \"canary\" diamonds (when of a fine\r\nbright yellow), or \"golden fancies,\" when of a fine golden brown, or\r\n\"orange,\" or \"pink,\" or \"absinthe green,\" or \"violet,\" as the case may\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nNAMES OF VARIOUS GRADES OF WHITE DIAMONDS. The great majority of the\r\ndiamonds which come on the market as cut stones belong, however, to the\r\ngroup which would be spoken of as white diamonds, but many qualifying\r\nnames are needed to express the degree of approach to pure white\r\npossessed by different grades of these diamonds. Thus the terms: 1,\r\n_Jägers_; 2, _Rivers_; 3, _Blue Wesseltons_; 4, _Wesseltons_; 5, _Top\r\nCrystals_; 6, _Crystals_; 7, _very light brown_; 8, _Top Silver Capes_;\r\n9, _Silver Capes_; 10, _Capes_; 11, _Yellows_, and 12, _Browns_,\r\ndescribe _increasing_ depth of color, and hence _decreasing_ value in\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\nPOPULAR NAMES. Certain more popular names for diamonds of differing\r\ndegrees of whiteness may next be set forth. The term \"blue white\" (a\r\nmuch abused expression, by the way) should be applied only to diamonds\r\nof such a close approach to pure whiteness of body substance, as seen\r\non edge in the paper that, when faced up and undimmed, they give such a\r\nstrong play of _prismatic_ blue that any slight trace of yellow in their\r\nsubstance is completely disguised, and the effect upon the eye is\r\nnotably blue. This would be the case with stones of the grades from 1\r\nthrough 4 in the list above. Grades 5 and 6 might properly be called\r\n\"_fine white_,\" and grades 7, 8, and 9 simply \"_white_.\" Grade 10 is\r\nfrequently spoken of as \"_commercial white_,\" and grade 11 sometimes as\r\n\"off color.\" Grade 12 includes all degrees of brownness except the very\r\nlight shades and the deep, pretty shades of the \"fancy\" browns.\r\n\r\nRUBIES. Leaving the naming of the different colors of diamonds we come\r\nto the gems furnished us by the mineral known as _corundum_. As we have\r\npreviously seen, this mineral occurs in many different colors and with\r\nwide differences of tint and shade in each of the principal colors. The\r\nbest practice with regard to naming the corundum gems is to call the\r\nred material, when of a good, full red of pleasing shade, _ruby_. The\r\nfinest shades of blood red are usually called \"_Burmah rubies_\" because\r\nmore rubies of this quality are found in Burmah than anywhere else. Any\r\nruby of the required shade would, however, be called a Burmah ruby in\r\nthe trade regardless of its geographical origin. The most desirable tint\r\namong Burmah rubies is that which is known as \"pigeon blood\" in color.\r\nThis color is perhaps more accurately defined as like the color in the\r\ncenter of the red of the solar spectrum. Certain slightly deeper red\r\nrubies are said to be of \"beef blood\" color. The English are said to\r\nprefer these. Those of slightly lighter tint than pigeon blood are\r\nsometimes referred to as of \"French color,\" from the fact that they are\r\npreferred by French connoisseurs.\r\n\r\nRubies of dark, garnet-like shade are known as \"_Siam rubies_,\" many\r\nsuch being found in that country. Light pinkish rubies are called\r\n\"_Ceylon rubies_.\" It should be clearly kept in mind that all these\r\n\"rubies\" are of red corundum, and that in all their distinctive\r\nproperties except color they are essentially similar.\r\n\r\nSAPPHIRES. Corundum of fine blue color is known as \"_sapphire_.\" The\r\n\"cornflower blue\" seems to be most in favor at present. Such sapphires\r\nare sometimes called \"_Kashmir sapphires_\" because many fine ones come\r\nfrom that State. \"_Ceylon sapphires_\" are usually paler than the\r\ncornflower blue. \"_Montana sapphires_\" are usually of greenish blue or\r\npale electric blue. Such fine blue stones as are mined in Montana would\r\nbe sold under another name according to the quality of their color, and\r\nnot as \"Montana sapphires.\" \"_Australian sapphires_\" are of a very deep,\r\ninky blue, and do not command a high price. Here again, as with rubies,\r\nthe classification depends upon the color rather than upon the origin,\r\nalthough the geographical names that are used, correctly state the\r\nusual source of stones of the particular color.\r\n\r\nAll corundums other than ruby and blue sapphire are usually called by\r\nthe term \"sapphire,\" with a qualifying adjective designating the color;\r\nthus we may have pink sapphire, golden sapphire, green sapphire, etc.\r\nWhen of very fine yellow color the yellow sapphire is sometimes called\r\n\"_Oriental topaz_\" by jewelers, the term \"_Oriental_\" as thus used\r\nindicating that the material is corundum. We also have \"_Oriental\r\namethyst_\" and \"_Oriental emerald_\" for the purple, and the fine green,\r\nand \"_Oriental aquamarine_\" for the light blue-green corundum. The\r\nyellow corundum is also sometimes called \"_King topaz_,\" especially in\r\nCeylon. Inferior sapphires of almost every conceivable color are\r\nfrequently assorted in lots and sold as \"fancy sapphires.\" Such lots,\r\nhowever, almost always need reclassification as they often contain as\r\nmany as a dozen mineral species besides corundum.\r\n\r\nSapphires and rubies of minute tubular internal structure frequently\r\ndisplay a beautiful six-pointed star when cut to a round-topped cabochon\r\nshape and exposed to direct sunlight or to light from any other single\r\nsource. Such stones are named \"_star sapphire_\" and \"_star ruby_.\"\r\n\r\nThe artificial rubies and sapphires should all be called _scientific\r\nruby_ or _sapphire_, and not \"_reconstructed_\" or \"_synthetic_\" as none\r\nare made to-day from small, real rubies, and as the process is in no\r\nsense a chemical synthesis.\r\n\r\nCHRYSOBERYL. Leaving the corundum gems we come next to chrysoberyl. When\r\nthe gems furnished by this mineral are of a fine green by daylight, and\r\nof a raspberry red by artificial light, as is sometimes the case, they\r\nshould be called \"_Alexandrites_\" (after the Czar Alexander II., in\r\nwhose dominions, and on whose birthday, the first specimens are said to\r\nhave been discovered). When chrysoberyl is of fibrous or tubular\r\ninternal structure it affords cat's-eyes (when cabochon cut), and these\r\nshould be specifically named as \"_chrysoberyl cat's-eye_\" to distinguish\r\nthem from the less beautiful and less valuable quartz cat's-eyes. Other\r\nvarieties of chrysoberyl (most of those marketed are of a\r\ngreenish-yellow color) are correctly named simply \"_chrysoberyls_.\" Such\r\nstones are, however, sometimes incorrectly called \"_chrysolite_\" by the\r\ntrade, and this practice should be corrected, as the term chrysolite\r\napplies correctly only to the mineral _olivine_ which gives us the\r\n_peridot_.\r\n\r\nSPINEL. Next in the order that we have chosen comes \"_spinel_.\" The more\r\nvaluable spinels are of a red color that somewhat closely approaches the\r\nred of some rubies. Such red spinels should be called \"_Ruby spinel_\"\r\n(and _not spinel ruby_). The stones themselves sometimes get mixed with\r\ncorundum rubies (they are frequently found in the same gem gravels), and\r\nthis makes it all the more necessary that both stones and names should\r\nbe clearly distinguished. Some dealers call reddish spinels \"_Balas\r\nruby_\" (rose red), and orange red ones \"_rubicelle_.\" Violet red spinel\r\nis sometimes called \"_almandine spinel_.\" It is very desirable that the\r\nname of the mineral species, _spinel_, should be used, together with a\r\nqualifying color adjective, in naming gems of this species, rather than\r\nsuch terms as \"rubicelle,\" \"balas ruby,\" \"spinel ruby,\" etc.\r\n\r\nTOPAZ. We come now to _topaz_. True, or _precious topaz_, as it is\r\nusually called, to distinguish it from the softer and less valuable\r\nyellow quartz, is seldom seen in the trade to-day. Jewelers almost\r\nalways mean yellow quartz when they speak of \"topaz.\" This is an\r\nunfortunate confusion of terms, and one which will be hard to eradicate.\r\nThere is seldom any injustice done through this misnaming, as the price\r\ncharged is usually a fair one for the material offered. Considerably\r\nhigher prices would be necessary if true topaz was in question.\r\n\r\nAn instance from the writer's experience will serve to illustrate the\r\nconfusion that exists in the trade as to what should be called topaz. A\r\njeweler of more than ordinary acquaintance with gems exhibited some fine\r\nbrooch stones as specimens of topaz. On remarking that they were of\r\ncourse _citrine quartz_ rather than _true topaz_, the author was met\r\nwith the statement that the brooch stones were _real_ topaz. In order to\r\nmake clear to the dealer the difference between the two species, the\r\nauthor asked him if he hadn't some smaller topazes in stock that had\r\ncost him considerably more than the brooch stones. The dealer replied\r\nthat he had some small wine yellow topazes for which he had paid more,\r\nand he produced them. The latter stones were true Brazilian topazes.\r\nMost of them had tiny, crackly flaws in them, as is frequently the case,\r\nand, as the writer pointed out to the dealer, they had been bought by\r\nthe _carat_, whereas the large brooch stones had been bought at a\r\ncertain price per _pennyweight_. In fact the little stones had cost more\r\nper carat than the larger ones had per pennyweight.\r\n\r\nThe dealer was then asked if there must not be some difference in the\r\nreal nature of the two lots to justify paying more per carat for small,\r\nimperfect stones than per pennyweight for large perfect ones. He of\r\ncourse acknowledged that it would appear reasonable that such was the\r\ncase. He was next shown that his small _true topazes_ scratched his\r\nlarge stones easily, but the large ones could get no hold upon the\r\nsurfaces of the small ones. (It will be remembered that topaz has a\r\nhardness of 8, while quartz has a hardness of 7.) The explanation then\r\nfollowed that the two lots were from two entirely distinct minerals,\r\ntopaz and quartz, and that the former was harder, took a somewhat better\r\npolish, and was more rare (in fine colors) than quartz. Of course the\r\nyellow quartz should be sold under the proper name, _citrine quartz_.\r\n(From the same root that we have in \"_citrus_\" as applied to fruits.\r\nFor example the \"California Citrus Fruit Growers' Association,\" which\r\nsells oranges, lemons, grape fruit, etc. The color implication is\r\nobvious.) If the jeweler still wishes to use the term \"topaz\" because of\r\nthe familiarity of the public with that name, then he should at least\r\nqualify it in some way. One name that is current for that purpose is\r\n\"Spanish topaz,\" another is \"Quartz-topaz.\" Perhaps the latter is the\r\nleast objectionable of the names that include the word topaz.\r\n\r\nSome of the wine yellow true topazes lose the yellow, but retain the\r\npink component, on being gently heated. The resulting pink stone is\r\nrather pretty and usually commands a higher price than the yellow\r\ntopazes. Such artificially altered topazes should be sold only for what\r\nthey are, and probably the name \"pinked topaz,\" implying, as it does,\r\nthat something has been done to the stone, is as good a name as any.\r\nThere is, however, little chance of fraud in this connection, as\r\nnatural pink topazes are not seen in the trade, being very rare.\r\n\r\nSome bluish-green topaz is said to be sold as aquamarine, and this\r\nconfusion of species and of names should, of course, be stopped by an\r\nactual determination of the material as to its properties. Lacking a\r\nrefractometer, the widely differing specific gravities of the two\r\nminerals would easily serve to distinguish them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XX\r\n\r\nTHE NAMING OF PRECIOUS STONES (_Concluded_)\r\n\r\n\r\nBERYL, EMERALD, AQUAMARINE. Coming now to _beryl_ we have first\r\n_emerald_, then _aquamarine_, then beryls of other colors to consider.\r\nThere is too often a tendency among dealers to confuse various green\r\nstones, and even doublets, under the name _emerald_. While the price\r\ncharged usually bears a fair relation to the value of the material\r\nfurnished, it would be better to offer tourmaline, or peridot (the\r\nmineral name of which is olivine), or demantoid garnet (sometimes\r\nwrongly called \"Olivine\"), or \"emerald doublets,\" or emerald or\r\n\"imitation emerald,\" as the case might be, under their own names.\r\n\r\nThere are no true \"synthetic\" or \"scientific\" or \"reconstructed\"\r\nemeralds, and none of these terms should be used by the trade. There\r\nhas been an effort made in some cases to do business upon the good\r\nreputation of the scientific rubies and sapphires, but the products\r\noffered, when not out and out glass imitations, have usually been\r\ndoublets or triplets, consisting partly of some pale, inexpensive,\r\nnatural mineral, such as quartz or beryl, and a layer of deep green\r\nglass to give the whole a proper color. All attempts to melt real\r\nemerald or beryl have yielded only a _beryl glass_, softer and lighter\r\nthan true emerald, and not _crystalline_, but rather glassy in\r\nstructure. Hence the names \"reconstructed,\" \"synthetic\" and \"scientific\"\r\nshould never be applied to emerald.\r\n\r\nThe light green and blue green beryls are correctly called\r\n_aquamarines_, the pale sky-blue beryls should be named simply _blue\r\nberyl_. Yellow beryl may be called _golden beryl_, or it may be called\r\n\"_heliodor_,\" a name that was devised for the fine yellow beryl of\r\nMadagascar. Beautiful pink beryl from Madagascar has been called\r\n\"_morganite_,\" a name that deserves to live in order to commemorate the\r\ngreat interest taken by J. Pierpont Morgan in collecting and conserving\r\nfor future generations many of the gems in the American Museum of\r\nNatural History in New York.\r\n\r\nZIRCON. We now come to a number of minerals slightly less hard than\r\nberyl, but harder than quartz, and _zircon_ is perhaps as hard as any of\r\nthese, so it will be considered next. Red zircon, which is rare, is\r\nproperly called \"_hyacinth_.\" Many Hessonite garnets (cinnamon stones)\r\nare incorrectly called hyacinths, however. The true hyacinth has more\r\nsnap and fire owing to its adamantine surface luster and high dispersive\r\npower, as well as to its high refractive index. A true hyacinth is a\r\nbeautiful stone. Golden yellow zircons are correctly called\r\n\"_jacinths_.\" Artificially whitened zircons (the color of which has been\r\nremoved by heating) are known as \"jargoons\" or sometimes as \"Matura\r\ndiamonds.\" All other colors in zircon should be named simply zircon,\r\nwith a color adjective to indicate the particular color as, \"brown\r\nzircon,\" etc.\r\n\r\nTOURMALINE. Tourmaline furnishes gems of many different colors. These\r\nare all usually called simply tourmaline, with a color adjective to\r\nspecify the particular color, as, for example, the \"pink tourmaline\" of\r\nCalifornia. Red tourmaline is, however, sometimes called \"_rubellite_,\"\r\nand white tourmaline has been called \"_achroite_.\" The latter material\r\nis seldom cut, and hence the name is seldom seen or used.\r\n\r\nGARNET. We may next consider the _garnets_, as most of them are somewhat\r\nharder than quartz. As was said in Lesson XVIII. in our study of mineral\r\nspecies, there are several types of garnets, characterized by similarity\r\nof chemical composition, or at least by analogy of composition, but,\r\nhaving specific differences of property. The names used by jewelers for\r\nthe several types of garnets ought to be a fairly true indication as to\r\nthe type in hand in a particular case. At present there is considerable\r\nconfusion in the naming of garnets. The most common practice is to call\r\nall garnets of a purplish-red color \"almandines.\" As many such garnets\r\nbelong to the mineral species _almandite garnet_, there is little\r\nobjection to the continuance of this practice. The somewhat less dense,\r\nand less hard blood red garnets are properly called \"_pyrope garnets_\"\r\n(literally \"fire\" garnets). Many of the Arizona garnets belong in this\r\ndivision. The term \"Arizona _rubies_\" should _not_ be used. As was said\r\nunder ruby, nothing but red corundum should receive that title.\r\nSimilarly the pyrope garnet of the diamond mines of South Africa is\r\nincorrectly called \"Cape ruby.\" Pyrope and almandite garnet tend to\r\nmerge in composition and in properties, and the beautiful \"_Rhodolite_\"\r\ngarnets of Macon County, North Carolina, are between the two varieties\r\nin composition, in color, and in other properties.\r\n\r\n_Hessonite garnet_ furnishes yellowish-red and brownish-red stones,\r\nwhich are sometimes also called \"cinnamon stones.\" They are also\r\nfrequently and incorrectly called jacinth or hyacinth, terms which, as\r\nwe have seen, should be reserved for yellow and red zircon,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n_Andradite garnet_ furnishes brilliant green stones, which have been\r\nincorrectly named \"Olivines\" by the trade. The name is unfortunate as it\r\nis identical with the true name of the mineral which gives us peridot.\r\nThe name does not even suggest the color of these garnets correctly, as\r\nthey are seldom olive green in shade. As the scarcity of fine specimens\r\nand their great beauty make a fairly high price necessary, the public\r\nwould hardly pay it for anything that was called \"garnet,\" as garnets\r\nare regarded as common and cheap. Perhaps the adoption of the name\r\n\"_Demantoid_\" might relieve the situation. The stones are frequently\r\nreferred to as \"demantoid garnets\" on account of their diamond-like\r\nluster and dispersion. The use of \"demantoid\" alone, if a noun may be\r\nmade from the adjective, would avoid both the confusion with the mineral\r\nolivine, and the cheapening effect of the word garnet, and would at the\r\nsame time suggest some of the most striking properties of the material.\r\n\r\n\"_Spodumene_\" furnishes pink to lilac \"_Kunzite_,\" named after Dr.\r\nGeorge F. Kunz, the gem expert, and for a time an emerald green variety\r\nwas had from North Carolina which became known as \"_Hiddenite_,\" after\r\nits discoverer, W. E. Hidden. No confusion of naming seems to have\r\narisen in regard to this mineral.\r\n\r\nThe next mineral in the scale of hardness is quartz. (Hardness 7.) When\r\npure and colorless it should be called \"_rock crystal_.\" Purple quartz\r\nis of course _amethyst_. Some dealers have adopted a bad practice of\r\ncalling the fine deep purple amethyst \"Oriental\" amethyst, which should\r\nnot be done, as the term \"Oriental\" has for a long time signified a\r\n_corundum_ gem. As Siberia has produced some very fine amethysts, the\r\nterm \"_Siberian amethyst_\" would be a good one to designate any\r\nespecially fine gem.\r\n\r\nQUARTZ GEMS. We have already considered the naming of yellow quartz in\r\nconnection with topaz. \"_Citrine quartz_\" is probably the best name for\r\nthis material. If it is felt that the name \"topaz\" must be used, the\r\nprefix \"quartz\" should be used, or perhaps \"Spanish topaz\" will do, but\r\nsome effort should be made to distinguish it from the true precious\r\ntopaz. In addition to amethyst and citrine quartz we have the pinkish,\r\nmilky quartz known as \"_rose quartz_.\" This is usually correctly named.\r\n\r\n\"_Cat's-eye_\" is a term that should be reserved for the Chrysoberyl\r\nvariety, and the quartz variety should always be called \"quartz\r\ncat's-eye.\" \"_Tiger's-eye_\" is a mineral in which a soft fibrous\r\nmaterial has been dissolved away, and quartz has been deposited in its\r\nplace. \"_Aventurine quartz_\" is the correct name for quartz containing\r\nspangles of mica. Clear, colorless pebbles of quartz are sometimes cut\r\nfor tourists. Such pebbles are frequently misnamed \"diamonds\" with some\r\nprefix, as for example \"Lake George diamonds,\" etc. Among the minutely\r\ncrystalline varieties of quartz we have the clear red, which should be\r\ncalled \"_carnelian_,\" the brownish-red \"_sard_,\" the green\r\n\"_chrysoprase_,\" the leek green \"_prase_,\" and the brighter green\r\n\"_plasma_.\" The last three are not so commonly seen as the first two,\r\nand frequently the best-colored specimens are artificially dyed.\r\n\r\n\"_Jasper_,\" a material more highly regarded by the ancients than at\r\npresent, is mainly quartz, but contains enough earthy material to make\r\nit opaque. \"_Bloodstone_\" is a greenish chalcedony with spots of red\r\njasper.\r\n\r\n\"_Agates_\" are banded chalcedonies, the variety called \"_onyx_\" having\r\nvery regular bands, and the \"_sardonyx_\" being an onyx agate in which\r\nsome of the bands are of reddish sard.\r\n\r\nJust as we considered opal with quartz (because of its chemical\r\nsimilarity) when discussing mineral species, so we may now consider the\r\nproper naming of opals here. \"_Precious opal_\" is distinguished from\r\n\"_common opal_\" by the beauty of its display rather than by any\r\ndifference in composition. The effect is of course due to the existence\r\nof thin films (probably of material of slightly different density),\r\nfilling what once were cracks in the mass. The rainbow colors are the\r\nresult of interference of light (see a college text on physics for an\r\nexplanation of interference). The varying thickness of these films gives\r\nvarying colors, so different specimens of opal show very different\r\neffects. The differences of distribution of the films within the\r\nmaterial also cause variations in the effects. Hence we have hardly any\r\ntwo specimens of opal that are alike.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, certain fairly definite types of opal and jewelers\r\nshould learn to apply correct names to these types. Most prominent\r\namong the opals of to-day are the so-called \"_Black opals_\" from New\r\nSouth Wales. These give vivid flashes of color out of seeming darkness.\r\nIn some positions the stones, as the name implies, appear blue-black or\r\nblackish gray. By transmitted light, however, the bluish stones appear\r\nyellow. Owing to the sharp contrast between the dark background and the\r\nflashing spectrum colors, black opals are most attractive stones and\r\nfine specimens command high prices. One fine piece, which was on\r\nexhibition at the Panama-Pacific Exposition was in the shape of an\r\nelongated shield, about 1-3/4 inches by 1-1/8 inches in size and rather\r\nflat and thin for its spread. It gave in one position a solid surface of\r\nalmost pure ruby red which changed to green on tipping the stone to the\r\nopposite direction; $2,000 was asked for the piece.\r\n\r\n\"_White opal_\" is the name applied to the lighter shades of opal which\r\ndo not show the bluish-black effect in any position. \"_Harlequin opal_\"\r\nhas rather large areas of definite colors giving somewhat the effect of\r\na map of the United States in which the different States are in\r\ndifferent colors.\r\n\r\n\"_Fire opal_\" is an orange-red variety. It has some \"play\" of colors in\r\naddition to its orange-red body color.\r\n\r\n\"_Opal Matrix_\" has tiny specks and films of precious opal distributed\r\nthrough a dark volcanic rock and the mass is shaped and polished as a\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nJADE. \"_Jade_\" should next receive attention. It is a much abused term.\r\nUnder it one may purchase _jadeite_, _nephrite_, _bowenite_,\r\n_amazonite_, or frequently simply _green glass_. The use of the word\r\nought to be confined to the first two minerals mentioned, namely,\r\njadeite and nephrite, for they only possess the extreme toughness\r\ntogether with considerable hardness that we expect of jade. Bowenite,\r\nwhile tough, is relatively soft and amazonite is brittle and also easily\r\ncleavable, while glass is both soft and brittle.\r\n\r\nPERIDOT AND OLIVINE. The mineral \"_olivine_\" gives us the \"_peridot_\"\r\n(this name should be kept for the deeper bottle green stones), and the\r\nolive green gems of this same mineral may correctly be called\r\n\"_olivine_\" or \"_chrysolite_.\" As was explained under garnet, jewelers\r\nfrequently use the term \"olivine\" to designate demantoid garnet. The\r\nterm chrysolite is also sometimes incorrectly used for the\r\ngreenish-yellow chrysoberyl.\r\n\r\nFELDSPAR GEMS. Among the minerals softer than quartz, which are used as\r\ngems, we have also \"_feldspar_,\" which gives us \"_moonstone_,\"\r\n\"_Labradorite_,\" and \"_Amazonite_.\"\r\n\r\nAn opalescent form of chalcedony is frequently gathered on California\r\nbeaches and polished for tourists under the name of \"_California\r\nMoonstone_.\" This name is unfortunately chosen as the material is not\r\nthe same as that of true moonstone and the effect is not so pronounced\r\nor so beautiful. The polished stones show merely a milky cloudiness\r\nwithout any of that beautiful sheen of the true moonstone.\r\n\"_Labradorite_\" is usually correctly named. \"_Amazonite_\" was originally\r\nmisnamed, as none is found along the river of that name. The term has\r\ncome into such general use, however, that we shall probably have to\r\ncontinue to use it, especially as no other name has come into use for\r\nthis bluish-green feldspar. As has already been said, amazonite is\r\nsometimes sold as \"jade,\" which is incorrect.\r\n\r\nMALACHITE, AZURITE, AND LAPIS LAZULI. _Malachite_ and _azurite_ are\r\nusually correctly named, but \"_lapis lazuli_\" is a name that is\r\nfrequently misused, being applied to crackled quartz that has been\r\nstained with Prussian blue, or some other dye, to an unconvincing\r\nresemblance to true lapis. Such artificially produced stones are\r\nsometimes sold as \"_Swiss lapis_.\" They are harder than true lapis and\r\nprobably wear much better in exposed ornaments, but they are not lapis\r\nand are never of equal color, and names should not be misused, and\r\nespecially is this true in a trade where the public has had to rely so\r\ncompletely upon the knowledge and the integrity of the dealer.\r\n\r\nWith the increase of knowledge about precious stones that is slowly but\r\nsteadily growing among the public, it becomes more than ever necessary\r\nfor the jeweler and gem dealer to know and to use the correct names for\r\nall precious stones. The student who wishes to learn more about the\r\nmatter will have to cull his information from many different works on\r\ngems. G. F. Herbert-Smith, in his _Gem-Stones_, gives a three and one\r\nhalf page chapter on \"Nomenclature of Precious Stones\" (Chap. XIII., pp.\r\n109-112). The present lesson has attempted to bring together in one\r\nplace material from many sources, together with some suggestions from\r\nthe author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXI\r\n\r\nWHERE PRECIOUS STONES ARE FOUND\r\n\r\n\r\nOCCURRENCE OF DIAMOND. Every dealer in precious stones should know\r\nsomething of the sources of the gems that he sells. The manner of the\r\noccurrence of the rough material is also a matter of interest. It will\r\ntherefore be the purpose of this lesson to give a brief account of the\r\ngeographical sources of the principal gems and of their mode of\r\noccurrence in the earth.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of uniformity of treatment we will once more follow the\r\ndescending order of hardness among the gems and we thus begin by\r\ndescribing the occurrence of diamond. It will be of interest to note\r\nfirst that the earliest source of the diamond was India, and that for\r\nmany years India was almost the sole source. Tavernier tells us that the\r\ndiamond mining industry was in a thriving state during the years from\r\n1640 to 1680, during which time he made six journeys to India to\r\npurchase gems. He speaks of Borneo as another source of diamonds, but\r\nmost of the diamonds of that time were furnished by India.\r\n\r\n\"GOLCONDAS.\" Indian diamonds were noteworthy for their magnificent\r\nsteely blue-white quality and their great hardness, and occasionally one\r\ncomes on the market to-day with an authentic pedigree, tracing its\r\norigin back to the old Indian mines, and such stones usually command\r\nvery high prices. One of a little over seven and one half carats in\r\nweight, in the form of a perfect drop brilliant, has lately been offered\r\nfor sale at a price not far from $1,000 per carat. Such diamonds are\r\nsometimes called \"Golcondas\" because one of the mining districts from\r\nwhich the fine large Indian stones came was near the place of that name.\r\nSome of the stones from the Jägersfontein mine in South Africa resemble\r\nthe Golcondas in quality. Many of the large historical crown diamonds\r\nof Europe came from the Indian mines.\r\n\r\nThe stones were found in a sedimentary material, a sort of conglomerate,\r\nin which they, together with many other crystalline materials, had\r\nbecome imprisoned. Their original source has never been determined. They\r\nare therefore of the so-called \"River\" type of stone, having probably\r\nbeen transported from their original matrix, after the disintegration of\r\nthe latter, to new places of deposit, by the carrying power of river\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nThe Indian mines now yield very few stones. The United States Consular\r\nreports occasionally mention the finding of a few scattered crystals but\r\nthe rich deposits were apparently worked out during the seventeenth\r\ncentury and the early part of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn 1725 and in the few following years the Brazilian diamond fields\r\nbegan to supersede those of India. Like the latter, the Brazilian fields\r\nwere alluvial, that is, the materials were deposited by river action\r\nafter having been carried to some distance from their original sources.\r\n\r\nBRAZILIAN DIAMONDS. The diamonds of Brazil also resembled those of India\r\nin quality, being on the average better than those of the present South\r\nAfrican mines. It may be added that even the African diamonds that are\r\nfound in \"river diggings\" average better in quality than those of the\r\nvolcanic pipes which form the principal source of the world's supply\r\nto-day. There seems to be a superabundance of iron oxide in the rocks of\r\nthe African mines and in the diamonds themselves, imparting yellow or\r\nbrownish tints to the material. The \"River\" stones seem to have lost\r\nthis color to a considerable extent, if they ever had it. Possibly long\r\nextraction with water has removed the very slightly soluble coloring\r\nmaterial. Whatever the cause of their superiority \"River\" stones have\r\nalways been more highly regarded than stones from the volcanic pipes.\r\n\r\nBrazil furnished the world's principal supply of diamonds until the\r\ndiscovery of the African stones in 1867. At present relatively small\r\nnumbers of Brazilian stones reach the world's markets. Most of these\r\ncome from the great Bahia district (discovered in 1844) rather than from\r\nthe older mines of Brazil. The present Brazilian stones average of small\r\nsize. They are, however, of very good quality as a rule. A few green\r\nstones are found in Brazil and these may be of an absinthe-green or of a\r\npistachio-green tint.\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIAN AND AMERICAN SOURCES. While a few diamonds now come on the\r\nmarket from New South Wales, and while an occasional stone is found in\r\nthe United States (usually in glacial drift in the north central States,\r\nor in volcanic material somewhat resembling that of South Africa in\r\nArkansas) yet the world's output now comes almost entirely from South\r\nAfrica and mainly from the enormous volcanic pipes of the Kimberly\r\ndistrict and those of the Premier Co. in the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nSOUTH AFRICAN DIAMONDS. The nature of the occurrence of diamond in the\r\n\"pipes\" of South Africa is so well known to all who deal in diamonds\r\nto-day that but little space need be devoted to it. The \"blue ground,\"\r\nas the rock in which the diamonds are found is called, seems to have\r\nbeen forced up from below, perhaps as the material of a mud volcano,\r\nbringing with it the diamonds, garnets, zircons, and the fifty or more\r\nother minerals that have been found in the blue ground. The fragmentary\r\ncharacter of some of these minerals would indicate that the blue ground\r\nwas not their original matrix. How the diamonds originally crystallized\r\nand where, is still probably a matter for further speculation.\r\n\r\nWhile at first the mines were worked, like quarries, from the surface,\r\nand while the great Premier mine is still so worked, most of the present\r\nmines are worked by sinking shafts in the native rock outside of the\r\nblue ground and then tunneling into the diamond-bearing rock laterally,\r\nremoving it to the surface, allowing it to weather on the \"floors\" until\r\nit crumbles, then crushing and washing it and concentrating the heavy\r\nminerals by gravity methods. Large diamonds are then picked out of the\r\nconcentrates by hand and small ones and fragments are removed by the\r\n\"greasers,\" which are shaking tables heavily smeared with grease over\r\nwhich the concentrates are washed and to which diamond alone, of all the\r\nminerals in the concentrate, sticks. The grease is periodically removed\r\nand melted, and the diamonds secured. The grease can then be used again.\r\n\r\nGerman South West Africa furnishes a considerable output of very small\r\ndiamonds, which are found in dry sand far from any present rivers. These\r\ndiamonds cut to splendid white melee and the output is large enough to\r\nmake some difference in the relative price of small stones as compared\r\nto large ones. The South West African field seldom yields a stone that\r\nwill afford a finished quarter-carat diamond.\r\n\r\nRUBIES. Passing on to the occurrence of the _corundum_ gems we will\r\nconsider first the _ruby_. Most fine rubies come from Burmah. The\r\ndistrict in which they are found is near Mogok. Practically all the fine\r\npigeon-blood rubies come from this district. The fashion for red stones\r\nbeing for the time little in evidence rubies are not now in great\r\ndemand. This cessation of demand can hardly be laid to the competition\r\nof the scientific ruby, for the sapphire is now very much in vogue, yet\r\nscientific sapphires resemble the natural ones even more closely than do\r\nthe rubies.\r\n\r\nSiam furnishes a considerable number of dark garnet-like rubies. These\r\ndo not command high prices. They are, however, sometimes very beautiful,\r\nespecially when well cut for brilliancy, and when in a strong light.\r\n\r\nCeylon furnishes a few rubies and a few red corundums have been found in\r\nNorth Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe Burmese rubies appear to have been formed in a limestone matrix, but\r\nmost of those obtained are gotten from the stream beds, where they have\r\nbeen carried by water after weathering out from the mother rock.\r\n\r\nThe rubies of Ceylon, too, probably originated in a limestone matrix,\r\nbut are sought in stream gravels.\r\n\r\nSAPPHIRES. Fine blue sapphires originate in Siam in larger numbers than\r\nin any other locality. Kashmir, in India, also supplies splendid\r\nspecimens of large size. Ceylon, too, furnishes a good deal of sapphire,\r\nbut mostly of a lighter color than the Kashmir sapphire. The Ceylon\r\nsapphires are found in the streams, but originate in rock of igneous\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nMontana furnishes considerable quantities of sapphire, some of which is\r\nof very good color. It is, of course, as good as the Oriental if of\r\nequal color, being of the same material. The better colored sapphire\r\nfrom Montana is mined from the rock. Most of the sapphires found in the\r\nriver gravels near Helena, Mont., are greenish blue or of other colors,\r\nand not of fine blue.\r\n\r\nQueensland and Victoria in Australia supply considerable quantities of\r\nsapphire. When blue the Australian sapphire is usually too dark to be\r\nvery valuable. The golden and other \"fancy\" sapphires of the trade come\r\nlargely from the Ceylon gravels. Siam yields silky brown stones and some\r\nfine green ones. Some of the Australian sapphires when cut in certain\r\ndirections yield green stones.\r\n\r\nCHRYSOBERYL. Chrysoberyl of the variety Alexandrite now comes mainly\r\nfrom Ceylon, although formerly from the Ural Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe cat's-eyes also come chiefly from Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe yellowish-green chrysoberyls (which jewelers sometimes call\r\nchrysolite) come both from Ceylon and from Brazil. They are frequently\r\nfound in papers of \"fancy sapphires\" or \"fancy color stones,\" so called.\r\n\r\nSPINEL. Spinels are found along with ruby in Burmah and in Siam and they\r\nalso occur in the gem gravels of Ceylon. Limestone is the usual matrix\r\nof spinel, although it is more often mined in gravels resulting from the\r\nweathering of the matrix.\r\n\r\nTOPAZ. True topaz, of wine-yellow color, comes mostly from Brazil.\r\nCeylon also furnishes yellow topaz. Asiatic Russia furnishes fine large\r\nblue or blue-green crystals resembling aquamarine in appearance. Most of\r\nthe topaz found in other localities is pale or colorless. Several of our\r\nwestern States, notably Utah, Colorado, and California, furnish\r\ncolorless topaz. Mexico and Japan also produce it. It is seldom cut,\r\nfor, while producing a rather brilliant stone, it has little \"fire\" and\r\nis therefore not very attractive.\r\n\r\nEMERALD AND AQUAMARINE. Beryl of the emerald variety is exceedingly\r\nscarce in the earth. Most of the best emerald comes from Colombia, South\r\nAmerica. Large crystals of paler color come from the Urals.\r\n\r\nLike ruby and spinel, emerald usually originates in limestone. One is\r\ntempted to suspect that these stones are of aqueous origin and that\r\nsapphires, and beryl, other than emerald, are more likely of igneous\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nBeryls of the aquamarine type occur in many places, but usually of too\r\npale a tint, or too imperfect, to be worthy of cutting. Fine gem beryl\r\nof blue and blue-green tints comes from Siberia and from several places\r\nin the Ural Mountains on their Asiatic slopes.\r\n\r\nThe Minas Geraes district of Brazil, famous for all kinds of gem stones,\r\nfurnishes most of the aquamarine of commerce. The pegmatite dikes of\r\nHaddam Neck, Conn., of Stoneham, Me., and of San Diego County, Cal.,\r\nhave furnished splendid aquamarine and other beryl. These dikes,\r\naccording to the geological evidence, are the result of the combined\r\naction of heat and water. Thus both melting and dissolving went on\r\ntogether and as a result many fine gem minerals of magnificent\r\ncrystallization were formed during the subsequent cooling. The longer\r\nthe cooling lasted and the more free space for growth the crystals had,\r\nthe larger and more perfect they got. The author has himself obtained\r\nfinely crystallized aquamarine and tourmaline from the Haddam, Conn.,\r\nlocality and the best specimens there occur in \"pockets\" or cavities in\r\nthe coarse granite. Within, these pockets are lined with crystals of\r\nsmoky quartz, tourmaline, beryl, and other minerals. Sometimes crystals\r\noccur in mud or clay masses inside the cavities and such crystals,\r\nhaving been free to grow uninterruptedly in every direction, were\r\nperfect in form, being doubly terminated, and not attached anywhere to\r\nthe rock.\r\n\r\nMadagascar has in recent years furnished the finest pink beryl, which\r\nhas been named Morganite. Yellow beryl (Heliodor) and aquamarine also\r\noccur in Madagascar.\r\n\r\nZIRCON. Zircon comes on the market mainly from Ceylon. It deserves to be\r\nas much esteemed in this country as it is in Ceylon, for its optical\r\nproperties are such that it is a very snappy stone. Some of the colors\r\nin which it occurs, such as the golden browns, lend themselves nicely to\r\nthe matching of gems and garments, and, with the growth of education in\r\nsuch matters, jewelers would do well to get better acquainted with the\r\npossibilities of zircon and to introduce it to their customers. The\r\nsupply from Ceylon is sufficient to justify popularizing the stone.\r\nSmall zircons are found in almost every heavy concentrate, as, for\r\nexample, in the concentrates of the diamond mines of South Africa, and\r\nin those of gold placers in many places. The rough stones resemble rough\r\ndiamonds in luster and are sometimes mistaken for diamonds.\r\n\r\nGARNETS. Garnets of various types are found widely distributed in\r\nnature. Perhaps the Bohemian supply is best known, having furnished a\r\nhost of small stones which have usually been rose cut for cluster work\r\nor made into beads. The Bohemian garnets are of the pyrope or fire-red\r\ntype. Relatively few large stones of sufficient transparency for cutting\r\nare produced in the Bohemian mines. The so-called \"Cape rubies\" of the\r\ndiamond mines of South Africa are pyrope garnets and some large and fine\r\nones are found. The \"Arizona rubies\" are pyrope garnets, and while\r\nseldom of notable size, some are of very fine color, approaching deep\r\nrubies, and the color remains attractive by artificial light.\r\n\r\nAlmandite garnet, the \"almandine\" of the jeweler is less abundant than\r\npyrope, when of gem quality. Ceylon furnishes some and India furnishes\r\nperhaps more. Brazil, from its prolific gem gravels at Minas Novas,\r\nsupplies good almandite, and smaller quantities are found in many\r\ndifferent localities.\r\n\r\nHessonite garnet, the cinnamon stone or \"hyacinth\" (incorrect) of the\r\ntrade, comes mainly from Ceylon.\r\n\r\nAndradite garnet, of the variety known as demantoid, from its\r\ndiamond-like properties, and which is usually sold under the misleading\r\nname \"olivine\" in the trade, comes from the western slopes of the Ural\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nTOURMALINE. Gem tourmaline comes from Ceylon, from Madagascar, from the\r\nUral Mountains, from Brazil, from Maine, from Connecticut, and from\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nThe Ceylon tourmalines are mostly yellow or yellowish green, sometimes\r\nfine olive-green. Those from the Urals may be pink, blue or green.\r\nBrazilian tourmalines are usually green, but sometimes red. In fact in\r\nmany localities several colors of tourmaline are usually found together\r\nand it may be that a single crystal will be green in most of its length\r\nbut red or pink tipped. Some crystals have a pink core and a green\r\nexterior. The author has found both of the two latter types in the\r\nHaddam, Conn., tourmalines, and on one occasion was surprised to get\r\nback a wine-colored tourmaline from a cutter to whom he had sent a green\r\ncrystal. There was but a thin shell of the green material on the\r\noutside of the crystal.\r\n\r\nSome of the Madagascar tourmaline is of a fine brownish red, almost as\r\ndeep as a light garnet, and much clearer than most garnet.\r\n\r\nWould it not be fitting on account of its occurrence in several\r\nlocalities in the United States, for Americans to use more tourmaline in\r\ntheir jewels? The quality of some of the tourmalines of Maine, and of\r\nCalifornia especially, is not excelled by tourmaline from any other\r\nlocality. Some of the Maine tourmaline is of a delightful, slightly\r\nbluish-green tint that almost approaches emerald.\r\n\r\nKUNZITE. Spodumene, of the variety kunzite, comes from San Diego County,\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nQUARTZ GEMS. Coming now to the quartz gems we find amethyst and citrine,\r\nor golden quartz widely distributed so that only the localities that\r\nfurnish the better grades of these stones need be mentioned. Siberia and\r\nUruguay furnish fine amethyst. Brazil also furnishes large quantities\r\nof very good quality.\r\n\r\nAMETHYST. The chief charm of the Siberian amethyst lies in its large red\r\ncomponent, which enables it to change from a deep grape-purple by\r\ndaylight to a fine red by artificial light that is rich in red rays, and\r\npoor in blue ones. The paler types of amethysts that were once esteemed,\r\nprobably for lack of the rich deep variety, become gray in appearance\r\nand much less lovely under artificial light. India furnishes some\r\namethysts, and papers of \"fancy color stones\" containing native cut gems\r\nfrom Ceylon, frequently contain amethysts, but Brazil, Uruguay, and\r\nSiberia furnish the great bulk of the stones that are regarded as choice\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nYELLOW QUARTZ. Citrine or golden quartz comes mainly from Brazil. The\r\n\"Spanish topaz\" is sometimes the result of heating smoky quartz from\r\nCordova province in Spain. Our own western mountains furnish\r\nconsiderable yellow and smoky quartz fit for cutting.\r\n\r\nROSE QUARTZ. Rose quartz of the finest quality comes from South Dakota.\r\nBavaria, the Ural Mountains, and Paris, Maine, have also furnished it.\r\n\r\nAGATE. Agates of the finest types, such as carnelian and sard, come\r\nprincipally from Brazil and from India.\r\n\r\nOPAL. Opals now come most largely from Australia, the Hungarian mines\r\nyielding but few stones at present. The fine black opals of New South\r\nWales are unsurpassed by any that have ever been found elsewhere. Mexico\r\nfurnishes considerable opal, and is notable for its fine \"fire opal\" or\r\n\"cherry opal.\"\r\n\r\nJADE. Most of the jade of the variety nephrite that is obtained to-day\r\ncomes from several of the provinces of China or from Siberia or from\r\nTurkestan. A dark-green nephrite comes from New Zealand.\r\n\r\nJade of the jadeite variety, which is harder than nephrite and more\r\nhighly valued, is rare. The best specimens come from Upper Burmah. It\r\nis also found in China and in Tibet.\r\n\r\nPERIDOT. Peridot, and the brighter olivine or chrysolite, while of the\r\nsame mineral species, do not seem to occur together. The darker\r\nbottle-green specimens come from the Island of St. John in the Red Sea.\r\nIt is said that many of the finer peridots now available have been recut\r\nfrom old stones mined many years ago.\r\n\r\nQueensland supplies light-green chrysolite, and Arizona a\r\nyellowish-green variety. Light-green stones have been found near the\r\nruby mines of Upper Burmah.\r\n\r\nMOONSTONE. Moonstone comes mainly from Ceylon. The native cut specimens\r\nare sent here and recut, as, when native cut, the direction of the grain\r\nis seldom correct to produce the moonlight effect in symmetrical\r\nfashion. The native cutters apparently try to retain all the size and\r\nweight that is possible, regardless of the effect.\r\n\r\nTURQUOISE. Turquoise of the finest blue and most compact texture (and\r\nhence least subject to color change) comes from the province of Khorasan\r\nin Persia. Several of our western states supply turquoise of fair\r\nquality, notably New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California.\r\n\r\nLAPIS LAZULI. Lapis Lazuli comes from Afghanistan, from Siberia, and\r\nfrom South America.\r\n\r\nMALACHITE. Malachite is found in many copper mines, but principally in\r\nthose of the Ural Mountains.\r\n\r\nAZURITE. Azurite is found in the Arizona mines and in Chessy, in France\r\n(hence the name chessylite, sometimes used instead of azurite).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREFERENCES. Students who wish to get a fuller account of the occurrence\r\nof precious stones should run through G. F. Herbert-Smith's _Gem-Stones_\r\nunder the different varieties. This work is the most recent authentic\r\nwork of a strictly scientific character. Dr. George F. Kunz's _Gems and\r\nPrecious Stones of North America_ gives a detailed account of all the\r\nfinds in North America up to the time of publication. Many of these are\r\nof course of little commercial importance. The _Mineral Resources of the\r\nUnited States_ contains annually a long account of the occurrences of\r\ngem materials in this country. A separate pamphlet containing only the\r\ngem portion can be had gratis from the office of the United States\r\nGeological Survey, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXII\r\n\r\nHOW ROUGH PRECIOUS STONES ARE CUT\r\n\r\n\r\nROUGH PRECIOUS STONES. John Ruskin, who had the means to acquire some\r\nvery fine natural specimens of gem material was of the opinion that man\r\nought not to tamper with the wonderful crystals of nature, but that\r\nrather they should be admired in the rough. While one can understand\r\nRuskin's viewpoint, nevertheless the art of man can make use of the\r\noptical properties of transparent minerals, properties no less wonderful\r\nthan those exhibited in crystallization, and indeed intimately\r\nassociated with the latter, and, by shaping the rough material in\r\naccordance with these optical properties, greatly enhance the beauty of\r\nthe gem.\r\n\r\nNo material illustrates the wonderful improvement that may be brought\r\nabout by cutting and polishing better than diamond. In the rough the\r\ndiamond is less attractive in appearance than rock crystal. G. F.\r\nHerbert-Smith likens its appearance to that of soda crystals. Another\r\nauthor likens it to gum arabic. The surface of the rough diamond is\r\nusually ridged by the overlapping of minute layers or strata of the\r\nmaterial so that one cannot look into the clear interior any more than\r\none can look into a bank, through the prism-glass windows that are so\r\nmuch used to diffuse the light that enters by means of them. Being thus\r\nof a rough exterior the uncut diamond shows none of the snap and fire\r\nwhich are developed by proper cutting.\r\n\r\nAs the diamond perhaps shows more improvement on being cut than any\r\nother stone, and as the art of cutting the diamond is distinct from that\r\nof cutting other precious stones, both in the method of cutting and in\r\nthe fact that the workers who cut diamonds cut no other precious stones,\r\nit will be well to consider diamond cutting separately.\r\n\r\nBefore discussing the methods by which the shaping and polishing are\r\naccomplished let us consider briefly the object that is in view in thus\r\naltering the shape and smoothing the surface of the rough material.\r\n\r\nHOW CUTTING INCREASES BRILLIANCY. Primarily the object of cutting a\r\ndiamond is to make it more brilliant. So true is this that the usual\r\nform to which diamonds are cut has come to be called the _brilliant_.\r\nThe adjective has become a noun. The increased brilliancy is due mainly\r\nto two effects: First, greatly increased reflection of light, and\r\nsecond, dispersion of light. The reflection is partly external but\r\nprincipally internal.\r\n\r\nTaking up first the internal reflection which is responsible for most of\r\nthe white brilliancy of the cut stone we must note that it is a fact\r\nthat light that is passing through any transparent material will, upon\r\narriving at any polished surface, either penetrate and emerge or else it\r\nwill be reflected within the material, depending upon the angle at\r\nwhich the light strikes the surface. For each material there is a\r\ndefinite angle outside of which light that is passing as above\r\ndescribed, is _totally reflected_ within the material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.\r\n\r\n_AB_ represents the back surface of a piece of diamond.\r\n\r\n_CD_ is a line perpendicular to _AB_.\r\n\r\nAngle _CDE_ is about 24 degrees.\r\n\r\nDotted line, _FDH_ represents the course taken by a ray of light which\r\nis totally reflected at _D_ in such fashion that angle _FDA_ equals\r\nangle _HDB_.\r\n\r\nAny light proceeding towards _AB_ but between _E_ and _C_, would fail to\r\nbe totally reflected. Most of it would penetrate _AB_.]\r\n\r\nTOTAL REFLECTION. For diamond this _critical angle_, as it is called, is\r\nvery nearly 24° from a perpendicular to the surface. If now, we shape a\r\ndiamond so that most of the light that enters it from the front falls\r\nupon the first back surface that it meets, at an angle greater than 24°\r\nto a perpendicular to that surface, the light will be totally reflected\r\nwithin the stone. The angle at which it is reflected will be the same as\r\nthat at which it meets the surface. In other words the angles of\r\nincidence and of reflection are equal. See Fig. 9 for an illustration of\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\nTHEORY OF THE \"BRILLIANT.\" In the usual \"brilliant\" much of the light\r\nthat enters through the front surface is thus totally reflected from the\r\nfirst rear facet that it meets and then proceeds across the stone to be\r\nagain totally reflected from the opposite side of the brilliant. This\r\ntime the light proceeds toward the top of the stone. See Fig. 10--(From\r\nG. F. Herbert-Smith's _Gem-Stones_).\r\n\r\nThe angles of the top of a brilliant are purposely made so flat that the\r\nup coming light fails to be totally reflected again and is allowed to\r\nemerge to dazzle the beholder. In the better made brilliants the angle\r\nthat the back slope makes with the plane of the girdle is very nearly\r\n41° and the top angle, or angle of the front slope to the plane of the\r\ngirdle is about 35°. Such well made brilliants when held up to a bright\r\nlight appear almost black--that is, they fail to pass any of the light\r\nthrough them (except through the tiny culet, which, being parallel to\r\nthe table above, passes light that comes straight down to it).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--COURSE OF THE RAYS OF LIGHT PASSING THROUGH A\r\nBRILLIANT.]\r\n\r\nIn other words, instead of allowing the light to penetrate them,\r\nwell-made brilliants almost totally reflect it back toward its source,\r\nthat is, toward the front of the stone. The well-cut diamond is a very\r\nbrilliant object, viewed from the front.\r\n\r\nWe must now consider how the \"fire\" or prismatic color play is produced,\r\nfor it is even more upon the display of fire than upon its pure white\r\nbrilliancy that the beauty of a diamond depends.\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF \"FIRE.\" As we saw in Lesson X. (which it would be well to\r\nre-read at this time), white light that changes its course from one\r\ntransparent medium to another at any but a right angle to the surface\r\ninvolved, is not only refracted (as we saw in Lesson II.) but is\r\ndispersed, that is, light of different colors is bent by differing\r\namounts and thus we have a separation of the various colors. If this\r\ntakes place as the ray of light leaves the upper surface of a brilliant\r\nthe observer upon whose eye the light falls will see either the red, or\r\nthe yellow, or the blue, as the case may be, rather than the white light\r\nwhich entered the stone. If instead, the dispersion takes place as the\r\nlight enters the brilliant the various colored rays thus produced will\r\nbe totally reflected back to the observer (slightly weakened by\r\nspreading, as compared to the direct or unreflected spectra). Thus\r\ndispersion produces the \"fire\" in a brilliant.\r\n\r\nOther materials than diamond behave similarly, but usually to a much\r\nsmaller extent, for few gem materials have so high a refractive power or\r\nso great a dispersive power as diamond.\r\n\r\nHaving considered the theory of the brilliant we may now take up a study\r\nof the methods by which the exceedingly hard rough diamond is shaped and\r\npolished.\r\n\r\nCLEAVING DIAMONDS. If the rough material is of poor shape, or if it has\r\nconspicuous defects in it which prevent its being made into a single\r\nstone, it is cleaved (_i. e._, split along its grain). Hard as it is,\r\ndiamond splits readily in certain definite directions (parallel to any\r\nof the triangular faces of the octahedral crystal). The cleaver has to\r\nknow the grain of rough diamonds from the external appearance, even\r\nwhen the crystals, as found, are complicated modifications of the simple\r\ncrystal form. He can thus take advantage of the cleavage to speedily\r\nreduce the rough material in size and shape to suit the necessity of the\r\ncase. The cleaving is accomplished by making a nick or groove in the\r\nsurface of the rough material at the proper point (the stone being held\r\nby a tenacious wax, in the end of a holder, placed upright in a firm\r\nsupport). A thin steel knife blade is then inserted in the nick and a\r\nsharp light blow struck upon the back of the knife blade. The diamond\r\nthen readily splits.\r\n\r\n\"CUTTING DIAMONDS.\" The next step is to give the rough material a shape\r\nclosely similar to that of the finished brilliant but rough and without\r\nfacets. This shaping or \"cutting\" as it is technically called, is done\r\nby placing the rough stone in the end of a holder by means of a tough\r\ncement and then rotating holder and stone in a lathe-like machine.\r\nAnother rough diamond (sometimes a piece of bort, unfit for cutting,\r\nand sometimes a piece of material of good quality which it is necessary\r\nto reduce in size or alter in shape) is cemented into another holder and\r\nheld against the surface of the rotating diamond. The holder is steadied\r\nagainst a firm support. It now becomes a case of \"diamond cut diamond,\"\r\neach stone wearing away the other and being worn away itself.\r\n\r\nThe cutting process is fairly rapid and it leaves the stone (which is\r\nreversed to make the opposite side) round in form and with a rounding\r\ntop and cone-shaped back. Stones of fancy shape, such as square, or\r\ncushion shape, have to be formed in part by hand rubbing or \"bruting\" as\r\nit is called.\r\n\r\nThe facets must now be polished onto the stone. Usually the workers who\r\ncut do not cleave or polish.\r\n\r\n\"POLISHING\" DIAMONDS. The polisher fixes the cut stone firmly in a\r\nmetallic holder called a dop, which is cleverly designed to hold the\r\nstone with much of one side of it exposed. The holder is then inverted\r\nso that the stone is beneath and a stout copper wire attached to the\r\nholder is then clamped firmly in a sort of movable vise. The latter is\r\nthen placed on the bench in such a position that the diamond rests upon\r\nthe surface of a rapidly revolving horizontal iron wheel or \"lap\" as it\r\nis called. The surface of the latter is \"charged\" with diamond dust,\r\nthat is, diamond dust has been pushed into the metal surface which thus\r\nacts as a support to the dust. The latter wears away the diamond,\r\nproducing a flat facet. The lap is kept moistened with oil and from time\r\nto time fresh oil and diamond dust are applied. A speed of about 2,000\r\nrotations per minute is used.\r\n\r\nFACETTING. The making of the facets is rather slow work, especially\r\nwhen, as is usually the case in making the \"table\" the work has to be\r\ndone against one of the \"hard points\" of the crystal. Great care has to\r\nbe taken to place the stone so that the grain lies in a correct\r\nposition, for diamond cannot be polished against the grain, nor even\r\nexactly with it, but only obliquely across it. This requirement, as much\r\nas anything, has prevented the use of machines in polishing diamonds.\r\nThe table is usually first polished on, then the four top slopes,\r\ndividing the top surface into quarters, then each of the four ridges\r\nthus left, is flattened, making eight facets and finally 32 facets,\r\nexclusive of the table, are made upon the top of the brilliant. The\r\nstone is then reversed and 24 facets, and the culet, polished on the\r\nback. As each facet nears its proper shape the stone is placed upon a\r\nparticularly smooth part of the lap and a slight vibratory motion given\r\nto the holder by the hand. This smooths out any lines or grooves that\r\nmay have formed because of inequalities of surface of the lap. When\r\ncompletely facetted the brilliant is finished and requires only to be\r\ncleaned, when it is ready for sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXIII\r\n\r\nHOW ROUGH PRECIOUS STONES ARE CUT AND WHAT CONSTITUTES GOOD\r\n\"MAKE\"--_Concluded_\r\n\r\n\r\nSLITTING AND CLEAVING. The cutting and polishing of precious stones\r\nother than diamond is a trade entirely distinct from diamond cutting.\r\nThe precious stone lapidary cuts every species of stone except diamond.\r\nThe methods used by different lapidaries vary somewhat in their details,\r\nand there are many trade secrets which are more or less jealously\r\nguarded by their possessors, but in general the methods used to reduce\r\nthe rough materials to the finished gems are as follows: First, the\r\nrough material, if of too large size, or if very imperfect, is\r\n_slitted_, or, if it possesses a pronounced cleavage, it may be\r\n_cleaved_, in order to reduce the size or to remove imperfect parts.\r\n_Slitting_ is accomplished by means of a circular disc of thin metal\r\nwhich is hammered so that it will be flat and rotate truly, and is then\r\nclamped between face plates, much as an emery wheel is held. The smooth\r\nedge of the circular disc is then charged with diamond dust and oil, the\r\ndiamond dust being bedded into the edge of the metal disc by the\r\npressure of some hard, fine-grained material, such as chalcedony, or\r\nrolled into the metal by the use of a rotating roller. Once charged, and\r\nkept freely supplied with oil, a slitting wheel will slice a\r\nconsiderable number of pieces of any precious stone less hard than\r\ndiamond, and will do so with considerable rapidity. The wheel is, of\r\ncourse, rotated very rapidly for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe cleaving of certain gem materials, such as true topaz (which splits\r\nperfectly across the prism, parallel to its base) is easily\r\naccomplished, and it is done in much the same manner as the cleaving of\r\ndiamond. The feldspar gems, such as moonstone, amazonite, and\r\nlabradorite, also cleave very smoothly in certain directions. Spodumene,\r\nof which Kunzite is a variety, cleaves almost too easily to be durable.\r\nMost gem minerals, however, lack such perfect cleavage and when it is\r\ndesired to remove imperfect parts, or to reduce large pieces to smaller\r\nsizes, these materials are slitted as above described.\r\n\r\n\"RUBBING DOWN.\" The material being of nearly the dimensions of the\r\nfinished piece, the next step is to \"rub it down,\" as it is called, to\r\napproximately the shape and size desired. This rubbing down process was\r\nformerly done by means of a soft metal lap (sometimes of lead), charged\r\nwith coarse emery powder and water. Carborundum, being harder and\r\nsharper than emery, has replaced it very largely. Some of the softer\r\nmaterials, such, for example, as turquoise, are rubbed down on a fast\r\nflying carborundum wheel of similar type to those used in machine shops\r\nfor grinding steel tools. These wheels rotate in a vertical plane and\r\nare kept wet. The laps before mentioned run horizontally. The\r\ncarborundum wheels have the grains of carborundum cemented together by\r\nmeans of some binding material and this gradually crumbles, exposing\r\nfresh, sharp cutting edges. Various sizes of grain, and various degrees\r\nof hardness of the binding material, as well as various speeds, are\r\nneeded to suit the many different materials rubbed down by the lapidary.\r\nSome lapidaries rub down the harder and more valuable gems such as ruby\r\nupon diamond charged laps of brass or other metal.\r\n\r\nCABOCHONS. The rubbing down process does not leave a facetted surface,\r\nbut only a coarse roughly rounded or flattened surface. If the material\r\nis to be left in some one of the flat-backed, rounded top forms known as\r\ncabochon cut, the surfaces need only to be smoothed (by means of very\r\nfine abrasives such as fine emery applied by means of laps, or even by\r\nfine emery or carborundum cloth), and they are then ready for\r\npolishing.\r\n\r\nFACETTED STONES. If, however, the stone is to be facetted in either the\r\nbrilliant form, somewhat like the diamond, or step cut or otherwise\r\nfacetted, it is cemented strongly onto a holder (much like the wooden\r\npart of a pen holder). The upper end of the holder is rested in one of a\r\nseries of holes in what is called a \"_ginpeg_\" resting in the work-bench\r\nnear a metal lap, and the stone is pressed upon the rapidly rotating\r\nsurface of the lap, which is charged with diamond dust or carborundum,\r\naccording to the hardness of the material to be facetted. A flat facet\r\nis thus ground upon the stone. By rotating the holder a series of\r\nfacets, all in the same set, is produced. The holder is then changed to\r\na new position on the ginpeg and another set of facets laid upon the\r\nstone. Thus as many as four or five tiers or sets of facets may be\r\napplied to one side, say the top of the stone. The latter is then\r\nremoved from the holder and cemented to it again, this time with the\r\nbottom exposed, and several sets of facets applied.\r\n\r\nThe stone is now _cut_ but not _polished_. The facets are flat, but have\r\na rough ground-glass like surface. The polishing is usually done by\r\nworkers who do not cut stones, but who do nothing but polish them. In\r\nsmall shops, however, the same lapidary performs all the parts of the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nPOLISHING. The polishing of stones, whether cabochon or facetted, is\r\naccomplished by the use of very finely powdered abrasives such as\r\ncorundum powder, tripoli, pumice, putty powder, etc. Each gem material\r\nrequires special treatment to obtain the best results. It is here that\r\nmost of the trade secrets apply.\r\n\r\nThe troubles of the lapidary in getting the keen polish that is so much\r\nadmired on fine gems are many. In general, the polishing powder should\r\nnot be quite as hard as the material to be polished, else it may grind\r\nrather than polish. The material should be used with water or oil to\r\ngive it a creamy consistency. It should be backed by laps of different\r\nmaterials for different purposes. Thus, when backed by a fairly hard\r\nmetal even tripoli, although much softer, will polish sapphire. On a lap\r\nof wood, tripoli would fail to polish hard materials, but would polish\r\namethyst or other quartz gem. A change of speed of the lap, too, changes\r\nthe effect of the polishing material. I have seen a lapidary, who was\r\nhaving no success at polishing an emerald, get very good results by\r\nusing a stick as a brake and slowing down his lap.\r\n\r\nThe polishing material must be of very uniform size, preferably water\r\nfloated or oil floated, to give good results. The lap must be kept flat\r\nand true and the stone must be properly held, or the flatness of the\r\nfacets, upon which brilliancy depends in part, will be destroyed during\r\nthe polishing.\r\n\r\nThe softer materials, such as opal, require treatment more like that\r\naccorded cut glass, and soft abrasive powders, such as pumice, suffice\r\nto polish them. Probably hardly two lapidaries would work exactly alike\r\nin their treatment of precious stones, and each guards his secrets, yet\r\nall use approximately similar general methods. Some have devised\r\nmechanical holders which permit the repeated cutting of stones to\r\nexactly the same angles, and that, too, with an accurate knowledge of\r\nthe angles used. These angles can be definitely altered for different\r\nmaterials, according to their refractive indices. Other lapidaries\r\nproduce very fine results by purely hand methods.\r\n\r\nThese details have been gone into to give an idea of the methods of the\r\nlapidary and of the many variations in method. In general, however, the\r\n_slitting_ or _cleaving_, the _rubbing down_ to shape, the _smoothing\r\nout_ of all scratches and the _facetting_ and _polishing_ are done\r\nsomewhat similarly by all lapidaries.\r\n\r\nHaving now had a glimpse of the methods of the lapidaries, let us\r\nbriefly consider what constitutes good \"make\" in stones other than\r\ndiamond.\r\n\r\nGOOD \"MAKE\" IN COLORED STONES. Brilliants, cut from materials having\r\nsmaller refractive indices than diamond, (and this group includes nearly\r\nall stones other than diamonds) should have steeper back angles and\r\nhigher tops than the best diamond brilliants have. A 35-degree top angle\r\n(the angle between the slope of the top and the plane of the girdle is\r\ncalled the top angle) and a 41-degree back angle being about ideal for\r\ndiamond, other gem materials should have more nearly a 39-degree top\r\nangle and a 44-degree back angle to give the greatest possible\r\nbrilliancy. However, in the case of colored gems such as ruby, sapphire,\r\netc., where the value depends even more largely upon the color than upon\r\nthe brilliancy, it is frequently necessary to cut the brilliant thicker\r\nor thinner than these proportions in order to deepen or to thin the\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nIn general, the thicker a stone of a given spread the deeper the color\r\nwill be. The color may also be deepened by giving to the stone a rounded\r\ncontour, both above and below the girdle, and facetting it in steps\r\ninstead of in the brilliant form. Increasing the number of steps also\r\nserves to slightly deepen the color, as a larger number of reflections\r\nis thus obtained within the material, the light thus has to travel a\r\ngreater distance through the colored mass, and more of the light, of\r\ncolor other than that of the stone, is absorbed.\r\n\r\nIMPROVING COLOR BY PROPER CUTTING. In addition to the color improvement\r\nthat can be brought about by changing the shape of the cut stone there\r\nare a number of gem materials whose color varies very greatly in\r\ndifferent directions, and this fact calls for skillful use in order to\r\nobtain the best possible results. Thus most tourmalines of deep color\r\nmust be cut with the top or table, of the finished stone, on the _side_\r\nof the prismatic crystal rather than at right angles to the axis of the\r\nprism. If cut the latter way they would be much too dense in color. On\r\nthe other hand, most blue sapphires should be cut _across_ the prism\r\naxis rather than the way that tourmalines should be cut. To cut a\r\nsapphire with its table on the side of the prism would be likely to\r\ncause it to have a greenish cast because of the admixture of the\r\nunpleasing \"ordinary ray\" of yellowish tint with the blue of the stone\r\nas seen up and down the prism. Some Australian sapphires are of a\r\npronounced green when viewed across the axis of the crystal.\r\n\r\nRubies if cut, as was recommended for sapphires, give a very pure and\r\nvery deep red color, but lack somewhat in the display of dichroism given\r\nby rubies that are cut with the table on the side of the crystal and\r\nparallel to its axis. Lapidaries need to know and to make use of such\r\noptical relations as these and jewelers might well inform themselves in\r\nsuch matters, especially if they have, or hope to acquire, trade in very\r\nfine colored stones.\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF SHAPE ON BRILLIANCY. In actual practice it is common to find\r\ncolored stones poorly cut for brilliancy, especially central\r\nbrilliancy, and that, too, without the excuse of sacrifice of brilliancy\r\nin order to improve color. The fault is usually due to too great a\r\ndesire to save size and weight. Frequently a stone would have greater\r\nvalue if properly cut, even at the expense of some size and weight. When\r\nstones are cut too shallow, as is frequently the case, they are sure to\r\nleak light in the center and they are thus weak and less brilliant there\r\nthan they would be if made smaller in diameter and with steeper back\r\nslopes approximating 44 degrees.\r\n\r\nRound stones, if their angles are correct, are more brilliant than\r\nstones of other contour such as square or cushion shape, or navette or\r\nheart shape. It can readily be seen that such odd-shaped stones can\r\nhardly have the same top and back angles at every part of their\r\ncircumference. If the angle from a corner of a square stone is correct\r\nthen the angle from the middle of one side is obviously a little\r\ndifferent. Small differences of angle make considerable differences in\r\nthe brilliancy of cut stones. The prevailing tendency to cut nearly all\r\ndiamonds round depends largely upon the above facts. In the case of\r\ncolored stones, however, the added attractiveness which comes with odd\r\nor different contour more than makes up for the slight loss of\r\nbrilliancy that may attend upon the shape selected. Such shapes as lend\r\nthemselves to special designs in mountings also justify any little loss\r\nin brilliancy that accompanies the change in shape, provided the\r\nproportions retained give a considerable amount of total reflection\r\nwithin the stone and thus light up most of the stone as seen from the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nThe test of the \"make\" of a color stone is its appearance. If it lights\r\nup well over most of its surface and if the color is right, one should\r\nnot criticize the \"make\" as one would be justified in doing in the case\r\nof a diamond. If, however, the effect is less attractive it would many\r\ntimes be advisable to measure the angles of the stone, or its thickness\r\nand spread as compared with similar measurements on a stone of fine\r\nappearance. Frequently one will thus find the reason for the failure of\r\nthe stone to perform as it might, and recutting should be resorted to in\r\nsuch cases in order to get a smaller but more beautiful and hence more\r\nvaluable stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXIV\r\n\r\nFORMS GIVEN TO PRECIOUS STONES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile precious stones are cut to many different forms, there are,\r\nnevertheless, but a few general types of cutting. These may be\r\nclassified as follows: First, the \"_cabochon_\" (Fig. 11) type of\r\ncutting; second, the old \"_rose_\" (Fig. 12) type of cutting; third, the\r\n_brilliant_ (Fig. 13); fourth, the _step cutting_ (Fig. 14).\r\n\r\nCABOCHONS. Of these the first, or _cabochon_ cutting, is probably the\r\nmost ancient. The term comes from a French word signifying a bald pate\r\n(caboche, from Latin cabo, a head). The usual round cabochon cut closely\r\nresembles the top of a head in shape. Cabochon cut stones usually have a\r\nflat base, but sometimes a slightly convex base is used, especially in\r\nopals and in moonstones, and some stones of very dense color are cut\r\nwith a concave base to thin them and thus to reduce their color. The\r\ncontour of the base may be round, or oval, or square, or cushion shape,\r\nor heart shape or of any regular form. The top is always smooth and\r\nrounding and unfacetted. The relation of the height or thickness to the\r\nlength or width may be varied to suit the size and shape of the rough\r\npiece or to suit one's ideas of symmetry, provided the material be an\r\nopaque one, such as turquoise or lapis lazuli. If, however, the material\r\nis transparent the best results in the way of the return of light to the\r\nfront, and hence in the display of the color of the material, are had if\r\nthe thickness is about one half the spread.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--CABOCHON CUTTING.]\r\n\r\nThis relation depends upon the refractive index of the material, but as\r\nmost color stones are of somewhat similar refractive indices, the above\r\nproportions are sufficiently accurate for all. The object in view is the\r\nsecuring of total reflection of as much light as possible from the flat\r\npolished back of the stone. Cabochon stones are sometimes set over foil\r\nor on polished gold to increase the reflection of light.\r\n\r\nThe path of a ray of light through a cabochon cut stone is closely\r\nsimilar to that through a rose cut diamond [see cut (c) of Fig. 12 for\r\nthe latter.] Like the rose cut, the cabochon cut does not give much\r\nbrilliancy as compared to the brilliant cut. Cabochon cut stones,\r\nhowever, have a quiet beauty of color which commends them to people of\r\nquiet taste, and even fine rubies, sapphires, and emeralds are\r\nincreasingly cut cabochon to satisfy the growing demand for fine taste\r\nin jewels. The East Indian has all along preferred the cabochon cut for\r\ncolor stones, but possibly his motives have not been unmixed, as the\r\ncabochon cut saves a greater proportion of the weight of the rough stone\r\nthan the more modern types of cutting.\r\n\r\nGarnets, more than other stones, have been used in the cabochon cut, and\r\nwhen in that form are usually known as _carbuncles_ (from carbunculus, a\r\nglowing coal). Any other fiery red stone might equally well be styled a\r\ncarbuncle, especially if cabochon cut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--ROSE CUTTING.]\r\n\r\nScientific rubies look very well in the cabochon cut.\r\n\r\nFig. 11 shows in (a) and (b) the front and top of the usual round\r\ncabochon. Cut (c) of the same figure gives the front elevation of a\r\ncabochon which will light up better than the usual round-topped design.\r\nIn the round-topped type the central part of the top is so nearly\r\nparallel to the back that light can pass right through as through a\r\nwindow pane. If the sloping sides are brought up to a blunt point, as in\r\ncut (c) there is very much less loss of light and greater beauty\r\nresults. The East Indian cabochons are frequently cut in a fashion\r\nresembling that suggested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--BRILLIANT CUTTING.]\r\n\r\nROSE CUT STONES. It was natural that the earliest cut stones should have\r\nthe simple rounded lines of the cabochon cutting, for the first thing\r\nthat would occur to the primitive worker who aspired to improve upon\r\nnature's product, would be the rubbing down of sharp edges and the\r\npolishing of the whole surface of the stone. Perhaps the next\r\nimprovement was the polishing of flat facets upon the rounded top of a\r\ncabochon stone. This process gives us the ancient type of cutting known\r\nas the _rose_ cut. The drawings (a) and (b) of Fig. 12 show the front\r\nelevation and the top and (c) shows the path of a ray of light through a\r\n\"rose.\" It will be noted that the general shape resembles that of a\r\nround cabochon, but twenty-four triangular facets have been formed upon\r\nthe top. The well-proportioned rose has a thickness about one half as\r\ngreat as its diameter. Diamonds were formerly cut chiefly in the rose\r\nform, especially in the days of the East Indian mines, and even in the\r\nearly part of the nineteenth century many people preferred finely made\r\nroses to the thick, clumsy brilliants of that day. To-day only very\r\nsmall pieces of diamond are cut to \"roses.\" As the material so used\r\nfrequently results from the cleaving of larger diamonds, the public has\r\ncome to know these tiny roses as \"chips.\"\r\n\r\nThe best roses have twenty-four regular facets but small ones frequently\r\nreceive only twelve, and those are seldom regular in shape and in\r\narrangement. Such roses serve well enough for encrusting watch cases and\r\nfor similar work, as the flat base of the stone can be set in thin metal\r\nwithout difficulty. About the only gem other than diamond that is now\r\ncut to the rose form is garnet. Large numbers of small Bohemian garnets\r\nare cut to crude rose form for use in cluster work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--STEP CUTTING.]\r\n\r\nTHE BRILLIANT CUT, as its name implies, gives the most complete return\r\nof light of any of the forms of cutting. The theory of the brilliant has\r\nalready been discussed (Lesson XXII. in connection with the cutting of\r\ndiamond). The shape of the brilliant is too well known to require much\r\ndescription. Most brilliants to-day are cut practically round and the\r\nform is that of two truncated cones placed base to base. The upper cone\r\nis truncated more than the lower, thus forming the large, flat top facet\r\nknown as the _table_ of the stone [A, Fig. 13, cut (a)]. The truncating\r\nof the lower cone forms the tiny facet known as the culet, which lies\r\nopposite to the table and is parallel to the latter [see B, Fig. 13, cut\r\n(a)]. The edge of meeting of the two cones is the _girdle_ of the\r\nbrilliant [CD in cut (a), Fig. 13]. The sloping surface of the upper\r\ncone is facetted with thirty-two facets in the full cut brilliant, while\r\nthe lower cone receives twenty-four.\r\n\r\nSmall stones sometimes receive fewer facets, to lessen the cost and\r\ndifficulty of cutting, but by paying sufficient for them full cut\r\nbrilliants as small as one hundred to the carat may be had. Cut (b) of\r\nFig. 13 shows the proper arrangement of the top facets and cut (c) that\r\nof the bottom facets.\r\n\r\nWhen cutting colored stones in the brilliant cut, especially if the\r\nmaterial is very costly and its color in need of being darkened or\r\nlightened, the lapidary frequently takes liberties with the regular\r\narrangement and proportions depicted in the cuts.\r\n\r\nSTEP CUTTING. The only remaining type of cutting that is in very general\r\nuse is the _step cut_ (sometimes known as trap cut). Fig. 14, (a), (b),\r\nand (c), shows the front elevation, the top and the back of a square\r\nantique step cut stone. The contour may be round or completely square or\r\noblong or of some other shape, just as a brilliant may have any of these\r\ncontours. The distinctive feature of the step cutting is the several\r\nseries of parallel-edged quadrangular facets above and below the girdle\r\nand the generally rounding character of its cross section. This plump,\r\nrounding character permits the saving of weight of the rough material,\r\nand by massing the color gives usually a greater depth of color than a\r\nbrilliant of the same spread would have if cut from similar material.\r\nWhile probably never quite as snappy and brilliant as the regular\r\nbrilliant cut, a well-proportioned step cut stone can be very brilliant.\r\nMany fine diamonds have recently been cut in steps for use in exclusive\r\njewelry.\r\n\r\nTHE MIXED CUT. The ruby and the emerald are never better in color than\r\nwhen in the full step cut, although rubies are frequently cut in what is\r\nknown as the _mixed_ cut, consisting of a brilliant cut top and a step\r\ncut back. Sapphires and many other colored stones are commonly cut in\r\nthe mixed cut. Recently it has become common to polish the tops of\r\ncolored stones with a smooth unfacetted, slightly convex surface, the\r\nback being facetted in either the brilliant or the step arrangement.\r\nSuch stones are said to have a \"_buffed top_.\" They are less expensive\r\nto cut than fully facetted stones and do not have the snappy brilliancy\r\nof the latter. They do, however, show off the intrinsic color of the\r\nmaterial very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXV\r\n\r\nIMITATIONS OF PRECIOUS STONES\r\n\r\n\r\n\"PASTE\" GEMS. Large volumes have been written on paste jewels,\r\nespecially on antique pastes. Contrary to a prevailing belief, the paste\r\ngem is not a recent invention. People frequently say when told that\r\ntheir gems are false, \"But it is a very old piece, it must be genuine.\"\r\nThe great age of a jewel should rather lead to suspicion that it was not\r\ngenuine than give confidence that a true gem was assured. The Egyptians\r\nand Romans were skillful makers of glass of the sort used in imitating\r\ngems and some of the old pastes were very hard or else have become so\r\nwith age.\r\n\r\nGlass of one variety or another makes the most convincing sort of\r\nimitation precious stones. The term \"paste\" as applied to glass\r\nimitations is said to come from the Italian _pasta_ meaning dough, and\r\nit suggests the softness of the material. Most pastes are mainly lead\r\nglass. As we saw in Lesson XVIII., on the chemical composition of the\r\ngems, many of them are silicates of metals. Now glasses are also\r\nsilicates of various metals, but unlike gem minerals the glasses are not\r\ncrystalline but rather amorphous, that is, without definite geometric\r\nform or definite internal arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe optical properties of the various glasses vary chiefly with their\r\ndensities, and the denser the material the higher the refractive index\r\nand the greater the dispersion. Thus to get the best results in\r\nimitation stones they should be made of very heavy glass. The dense\r\nflint glass (chiefly a silicate of potassium and lead) which is used for\r\ncut glass ware illustrates admirably the optical properties of the heavy\r\nglasses. By using even more lead a still denser glass may be had, with\r\neven a greater brilliancy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the addition of lead or other heavy metals (such as\r\nthallium) makes the product very soft and also very subject to attack by\r\ngases such as are always present in the atmosphere of cities. This\r\nsoftness causes the stones to scratch readily so that when worn they\r\nsoon lose their polish and with the loss of polish they lose their\r\nbeauty. The attack of the gases before mentioned darkens the surfaces of\r\nthe imitation and further dulls it. When fresh and new a well cut piece\r\nof colorless paste has a snap and fire that approaches that of diamond.\r\nThe surface luster is not adamantine, however, and the edges of the\r\nfacets cannot be polished so sharply as those on a diamond. Moreover the\r\nrefractive index, while high, is never so high as in a diamond and hence\r\nthe brilliant cannot be so shaped as to secure the amount of total\r\nreflection given by a well-made diamond. Hence, the paste brilliant,\r\nwhile quite satisfying as seen from squarely in front, is weak and dark\r\nin the center as seen when tilted to one side. By these differences the\r\ntrained eye can detect paste imitations of diamond at a glance without\r\nrecourse to tests of specific gravity, hardness, etc.\r\n\r\nPastes, being amorphous, are singly refracting, as is diamond. This fact\r\nhelps the appearance of the paste brilliant, for light does not divide\r\nwithin it to become weakened in power. This singleness of refraction,\r\nhowever, betrays the paste imitation when it is colored to resemble\r\nruby, sapphire or emerald, all of which are doubly refracting.\r\n\r\nThe color is imparted to pastes by the addition, during their\r\nmanufacture, of various metallic oxides in small proportions. Thus\r\ncobalt gives a blue color, copper or chromium green, copper or gold give\r\nred (under proper treatment) and manganese gives purple. By experiment\r\nthe makers of pastes have become very skillful in imitating the color of\r\nalmost any precious stone. Fine paste emeralds may look better than\r\ninferior genuine emeralds.\r\n\r\nAs pastes are singly refracting and hence lack dichroism, the pleasing\r\nvariety of color of the true ruby cannot be had in a paste imitation,\r\nbut the public is not critical enough to notice this lack. The expert\r\nwould, however, note it and could detect the imitation by that\r\ndifference as well as by the lack of double refraction. The use of\r\ndirect sunlight and a white card as already explained in the lesson on\r\ndouble refraction (Lesson III.) will serve to expose the singleness of\r\nrefraction of paste imitations. Spinels and garnets are about the only\r\ntrue gems (except diamond) that are single refracting. Any other color\r\nstone should show double refraction when tested by the sunlight-card\r\nmethod. The file test will also expose any paste imitation as all the\r\nvery brilliant pastes are fairly soft.\r\n\r\nDOUBLETS. To give better wearing quality to paste imitations the\r\n_doublet_ was devised. This name is used because the product is in two\r\nparts, a lower or back portion of paste and an upper or top portion of\r\nsome cheap but hard genuine stone. Garnet is probably used for this\r\npurpose to a greater extent than any other material, although quartz or\r\ncolorless topaz will do very well.\r\n\r\nThe usual arrangement of the parts can be seen in Fig. 15, the garnet\r\ncovering only a part of the upper surface, namely the table part and a\r\nsmall portion of the sloping surface of the top. In high class doublets\r\nthe hard mineral covers the paste to the girdle. (See Fig. 16.) The\r\ncolor of the garnet does not interfere seriously with that of the paste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. ONE FORM OF CHEAP DOUBLET.]\r\n\r\nIf a \"diamond\" doublet is desired the slice of garnet is made nearly as\r\nthin as paper and it covers only the table of the brilliant. It is thus\r\npractically colorless. A thin slice of red garnet over a green\r\nbackground is not noticeable, as all the red is absorbed in passing\r\nthrough the green material beneath. With a blue base, the red upper\r\nlayer may give a very slight purple effect. With yellow a slight orange\r\ntint results and of course with a red back no perceptible difference\r\nwould result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. ANOTHER FORM OF DOUBLET.]\r\n\r\nThe two materials are cemented together, by means of a transparent\r\nwaterproof cement. The _triplet_ has already been described in Lesson\r\nXII. It is even better than the doublet and more difficult to detect.\r\nBoth the file test and the sunlight-card test serve to detect doublets,\r\nas well as paste imitations, except that in the file test with the fully\r\nprotected doublet the _back_ of the stone must be tested with the file,\r\nas the girdle and top are of hard material.\r\n\r\nIn the sunlight-card test of a doublet (the refraction of garnet being\r\nsingle like that of glass), single images of the facets will be had on\r\nthe card when the sunlight is reflected onto it. A reflection of the\r\nlower or inner surface of the garnet top can be seen also and this\r\nserves to still further identify a doublet or a triplet. The appearance\r\nof this reflection is much like that received on the card from the top\r\nof the table. It is larger than the reflections of the smaller facets\r\nand is but little colored.\r\n\r\nTESTS FOR DOUBLETS. A trained eye can also detect a doublet or a triplet\r\nby noting the difference in the character of the surface luster of the\r\ngarnet part and of the glass part. Garnet takes a keener and more\r\nresinous luster than glass. By tipping the doublet so that light is\r\nreflected to the eye from the sloping top surface, one can see at once\r\nwhere the garnet leaves off and the glass begins. Even through a show\r\nwindow one can tell a doublet in this way although here it is necessary\r\nto move oneself, instead of the stone, until a proper position is\r\nobtained to get a reflection from the top slope of the doublet.\r\n\r\nIf the garnet covers the whole top of the imitation then it is not\r\npossible to get so direct a comparison, but even here one can look first\r\nat the top surface and then at the back and thus compare the luster. It\r\nis also well to closely examine with a lens the region of the girdle, to\r\nsee if any evidence of the joining of two materials can be seen.\r\nFrequently the lapidary bevels the edge so as to bring the line of\r\njunction between real and false material at the sharp edge of the bevel.\r\nBoiling a doublet in alcohol or chloroform will frequently dissolve the\r\ncement and separate the parts.\r\n\r\nThe dichroscope also serves to detect the false character of doublets\r\nand paste imitations, as neither shows dichroism. As rubies, emeralds,\r\nsapphires, and in fact most colored stones of value, show distinct\r\ndichroism, this test is a sure one against these imitations.\r\n\r\nTriplets and doublets too may be exposed by dipping them _sidewise_ into\r\noil, thus removing the prismatic refraction almost completely, as the\r\noil has about the same refractive index as the stone. One can then look\r\ndirectly through glass and garnet, or other topping material,\r\nseparately, and each material then shows its proper color. Thus zones of\r\ncolor appear in a doublet or triplet when under the oil. A real gem\r\nwould appear almost uniform in color under these conditions.\r\n\r\nRound gas bubbles can frequently be found in paste, and hence in the\r\npaste part of a doublet. Also, the natural flaws of the real stone are\r\nnever found in paste, but may be present in the real stone part of a\r\ndoublet or a triplet. Some imitation emeralds on the market, however,\r\nhave been made in a way to counterfeit the flaws and faults generally\r\nfound in this stone.\r\n\r\nALTERED STONES. In addition to the out and out imitations made of paste,\r\nand the doublets, there are numerous imitations current in the trade\r\nthat are made by staining or by otherwise altering the color of some\r\ngenuine but inexpensive gem material.\r\n\r\nFor example, large quantities of somewhat porous chalcedony from Brazil\r\nare stained and sold in imitation of natural agate or sard or other\r\nstones. In many cases the staining is superficial, so that the stone has\r\nto be shaped before it is stained, then stained and polished.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of slightly crackled quartz are stained to resemble\r\nlapis lazuli, and sold, usually with the title \"Swiss Lapis.\" A file\r\ntest will reveal the character of this imitation, as it is harder than a\r\nfile, while true lapis is softer. The color too is never of so fine a\r\nblue as that of fine lapis. It has a Prussian blue effect.\r\n\r\nTurquoises of inferior color are also sometimes stained to improve\r\nthem. A better product is made artificially.\r\n\r\nOpals are sometimes impregnated with organic matter, which is then\r\ncharred, perhaps with sulphuric acid, thus giving them somewhat the\r\nappearance of black opal.\r\n\r\nOpals are also imitated by adding oxide of tin to glass, thus imparting\r\na slight milkiness to it. The imitation is then shaped from this glass\r\nby molding, and the back of the cabochon is given an irregular surface,\r\nwhich may be set over tinsel to give the effect of \"fire.\"\r\n\r\nPale stones are frequently mounted over foil, or in enameled or stained\r\nsettings and thus their color is seemingly improved.\r\n\r\nDiamonds of poor color are occasionally \"painted\"; often the back of the\r\nbrilliant is treated with a violet dyestuff, which even in so small an\r\namount that it is difficult to detect, will neutralize the yellow of the\r\nstone and make it appear to be of a fine blue-white color. The\r\n\"painting\" is, of course, not permanent, so that such treatment of a\r\ndiamond with a view to selling it is fraudulent. The painted stone may\r\nbe detected by washing it with alcohol, when the dye will be removed and\r\nthe off-color will become apparent. If the stone is unset one can see\r\nwith a lens a wavery metallic appearance on the surfaces that have been\r\n\"painted.\" This effect is due to the action of the very thin film of dye\r\nupon the light that falls upon it.\r\n\r\nBesides the staining of genuine materials, they are sometimes altered in\r\ncolor by heat treatment, and this topic will be discussed in the next\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXVI\r\n\r\nALTERATION OF THE COLOR OF PRECIOUS STONES\r\n\r\n\r\nMany gem minerals change color when more or less strongly heated.\r\nExtreme heat whitens many colored materials completely.\r\n\r\n\"PINKED TOPAZ.\" John Ruskin advises us to \"seek out and cast aside all\r\nmanner of false or dyed or altered stones\" but, in spite of his advice,\r\nperhaps the most justifiable use of heat treatment is that which alters\r\nthe color of true topaz from a wine-yellow to a fine pink. It would\r\nappear that the wine-yellow is a composite color composed of pink and\r\nyellow and that the pink constituent is less easily changed by heat than\r\nis the yellow one. If too high a temperature is used both colors\r\ndisappear and white topaz results. As the latter is abundant in nature\r\nand of little value, such a result is very undesirable. Pink topaz,\r\nhowever, is very rare, and until recently, when pink tourmaline from\r\nCalifornia and Madagascar, and pink beryl (morganite) from Madagascar,\r\nbecame available in quantity, the \"pinked\" topazes had but few competing\r\ngems, and thus commanded a higher price than the natural topazes. Of\r\ncourse, care has to be taken in heating a mineral to raise and lower the\r\ntemperature slowly, in order to avoid sudden and unequal expansion or\r\ncontraction, which would crack and ruin the specimen, as the writer\r\nlearned to his sorrow with the first topaz that he tried to \"pink.\"\r\n\r\nSPANISH TOPAZ. Another material that gains a more valuable color by heat\r\ntreatment is the smoky quartz of Spain, which, on being gently heated,\r\nyields the so-called Spanish topaz. Some amethysts are altered to a\r\nyellow color by mild heating. Too great a temperature completely\r\ndecolorizes colored quartz. Some dark quartz yields a nearly garnet red\r\nproduct, after heating.\r\n\r\nZIRCON. Slight increase in temperature causes many of the zircons from\r\nCeylon to change markedly in color. An alcohol flame serves admirably to\r\neffect the change, care being taken to warm up the stone very gradually\r\nand to cool it slowly. Drafts should be prevented, as they might\r\nsuddenly cool the stone and crack it. Some zircons become completely\r\nwhitened by this treatment. At the same time they increase markedly in\r\ndensity and in refractive index and thus become even more snappy and\r\nbrilliant than when colored. One is tempted to suspect that the \"space\r\nlattice\" of the crystal has had its strata drawn closer together during\r\nthe heating and left permanently in a closer order of arrangement. Other\r\nzircons merely become lighter colored and less attractive. Some of the\r\nwhitened stones again become more or less colored on exposure to strong\r\nlight. Ultra-violet light will sometimes restore these to a fine deep\r\ncolor in a short time.\r\n\r\nThe whitened zircon, when finely cut in the brilliant form, with truly\r\nflat facets and sharp edges and with a top angle of about 39 degrees and\r\na back angle of about 44 degrees, so closely resembles a diamond that it\r\nwill deceive almost anyone on casual inspection. The expert, even, may\r\nbe deceived, if caught off his guard. The writer has a fine specimen of\r\na little over one carat, with which he has deceived many jewelers and\r\npawnbrokers, and even an importer or two. If it is presented as a stone\r\nthat closely resembles diamond your expert will say: \"Yes, it is pretty\r\ngood, but it would never fool me.\" If, however, you catch him off his\r\nguard by suggesting, perhaps, \"Did you ever see a diamond with a\r\npolished girdle?\", then he will look at it with interest, remark on its\r\nfine color and \"make,\" and never think of challenging its character.\r\n\r\nThe refractive index of the dense type of zircon is so high (1.92-1.98)\r\nthat it lights up well over most of the surface of the brilliant when\r\ncut, as above indicated, and does not show markedly the weak dark center\r\nshown by white sapphire, white topaz, colorless quartz, colorless beryl,\r\nand paste, when seen from the side. Moreover, the luster of zircon is\r\nnearly adamantine, so the expert does not miss the cold metallic glitter\r\nas he would with any other white stone. The color dispersion, too, is so\r\nhigh (86% as great as in diamond) that the zircon has considerable\r\n\"fire,\" and thus the casual handler is again deceived. A fine white\r\nzircon is really prettier than a _poor_ diamond. It cannot compare,\r\nhowever, with a _fine_ diamond. It would never do to let an expert see\r\nyour zircon beside even a fair diamond. The zircon would look \"sleepy.\"\r\nIt is only when no direct comparison is possible, and when the expert is\r\nnot suspicious, that a zircon can deceive him. Of course, the use of the\r\nscientific tests of the earlier lessons will, at once, detect the\r\ncharacter of a whitened zircon. The hardness is but 7.5, the refraction\r\nso strongly double that the edges of the back facets appear double-lined\r\nwhen viewed through the table with a lens, and the specific gravity is\r\n4.69. Double spots of light appear on the card when the sunlight-card\r\ntest is applied. Hence, it is easy to detect zircon by any of these\r\ntests if there is reason to suspect that it has been substituted for\r\ndiamond.\r\n\r\nCORUNDUM GEMS. Rubies of streaky color are said to be improved by\r\ncareful heating. Usually ruby undergoes a series of color changes on\r\nbeing heated, but returns through the same series in reverse order on\r\nbeing cooled, and finally resumes its original color. Strong heating\r\nwill whiten some yellow sapphire. The author thus obtained a white\r\nsapphire from a crystal of light yellow material.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the corundum gems undergo marked change\r\nin color under the influence of radium. A regular series of changes is\r\nsaid to be produced in white sapphire by this means, the final color\r\nbeing yellow. This color may then be removed by heat and the series run\r\nthrough again. It is not stated that a fine red has ever been thus\r\nobtained. Perhaps Nature, by her slower methods, using the faint traces\r\nof radio-active material in the rocks, reddens the corundum of Burmah at\r\nher leisure, and finally arrives at the much sought \"pigeon blood\"\r\ncolor. It is said that the natives of India have a legend to the effect\r\nthat the white sapphires of the mines are \"ripening rubies,\" and that\r\none day they will mature. Perhaps they are not far wrong.\r\n\r\nDIAMOND. Diamonds of yellowish tint may be improved in color by the use\r\nof high-power radium. At present the latter is so rare and costly that\r\nthere is no evidence of its commercial use for this purpose. Scientists\r\nhave brought about the change to a light blue as an experiment. It is\r\nnot yet known whether the change will be permanent. Perhaps here again\r\nNature has anticipated man's discovery and made the fine bluish-violet\r\nBrazilian diamonds (which fluoresce to a deep violet under an arc light,\r\nand which shine for a few moments in the dark after exposure to light)\r\nby associating them for ages with radio-active material. Some of the\r\nAfrican stones also have these characteristics.\r\n\r\nAside from the change in the color of diamond that may be brought about\r\nby means of radium, the mineral is extremely reluctant to alter its\r\ncolor. Many experimenters besides the author have tried in vain a host\r\nof expedients in the hope of finding some way to improve the color of\r\ndiamond. About the only noticeable alteration that the author has been\r\nable to bring about was upon a brown diamond, the color of which was\r\nmade somewhat lighter and more ashen by heating it in a current of\r\nhydrogen gas to a low red heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXVII\r\n\r\nPEARLS\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike the gems that have been so far considered, the pearl is not a\r\nmineral, but is of organic origin, that is, it is the product of a\r\nliving organism. There are two principal types of molluscs which yield\r\ntrue pearls in commercial quantities. The best known of the first type\r\nis the so-called pearl oyster (_Meleagrina margaritifera_). The pearl\r\nmussel of fresh water streams is of the second type (_Unio\r\nmargaritifera_). Other species of molluscs having pearly linings to\r\ntheir shells may produce pearls, but most of the pearls of commerce come\r\nfrom one or the other of the two varieties mentioned.\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE OF PEARL. The structure and material of the true pearl must be\r\nfirst understood in order to understand the underlying reasons for the\r\nremarkable beauty of this gem. Pearls are composed partly of the mineral\r\nsubstance calcium carbonate (chemically the same as marble) and partly\r\nof a tough, horny substance of organic nature called conchiolin. The\r\nshell of the pearl-bearing mollusc is also composed of these two\r\nsubstances. Calcium carbonate may crystallize in either of two forms,\r\ncalcite or aragonite. In marble we have calcite. In the outer portions\r\nof the shell of the pearl oyster the calcium carbonate is in the form of\r\ncalcite, but in the inner nacreous lining and in the pearl itself the\r\nmineral is present as aragonite. This is deposited by the mollusc in\r\nvery thin crystalline layers in the horny layers of conchiolin, so that\r\nthe lining of the shell is built of approximately parallel layers of\r\nmineral and of animal substance. In the normal shell this is all that\r\ntakes place, but in the case of a mollusc whose interior is invaded by\r\nany small source of irritation, such as a borer, or a grain of sand, or\r\nother bit of foreign material, a process of alternate deposit of\r\nconchiolin and of aragonite goes on upon the invading matter, thus\r\nforming a pearl.\r\n\r\nThe pearl is built in layers like an onion. In shape it may be\r\nspherical, or pear-shaped, or button-shaped or of any less regular shape\r\nthan these. The regular shapes are more highly valued. The spherical\r\nshape is of greatest value, other things being equal. Next comes the\r\ndrop or pear shape, then the button shape, and after these the host of\r\nirregular shapes known to the jeweler as \"baroques.\" The river man who\r\ngathers mussels calls these odd-shaped pearls \"slugs.\"\r\n\r\nLet us now attempt to understand how the beautiful luster and\r\niridescence of the pearl are related to the layer-like structure of the\r\ngem. In the first place, it should be understood that both conchiolin\r\nand aragonite are translucent, that is, they pass light to a certain\r\nextent. The layers being exceedingly thin, light can penetrate a\r\nconsiderable number of them if not otherwise deflected from its course.\r\nWe thus obtain reflections not merely from the outer surface of a pearl,\r\nbut from layer after layer within the gem and all these reflections\r\nreach the eye in a blended reflection of great beauty. The luster of a\r\npearl is then not purely a _surface luster_ in the usual sense of that\r\nterm, but it is a luster due to many superposed surfaces. It is so\r\ndifferent from other types of luster that we describe it merely as\r\n_pearly luster_ even though we find it in some other material, as, for\r\nexample in certain sapphires, in which it is due to a similar layer-like\r\narrangement of structure.\r\n\r\nORIENT. The fineness of the luster of a pearl, or as is said in the\r\ntrade, the _orient_, depends upon the number of layers that take part in\r\nthe reflection, and this number in turn depends upon the translucency of\r\nthe material and the thinness of the layers. Very fine pearls usually\r\nhave very many, very thin layers taking part in the reflection. The\r\ndegree of translucency, considered apart, is sometimes called the\r\n\"water\" of the pearl.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their beautiful luster, many pearls display iridescence,\r\nand this is due in part, as in the case of the pearly lining of the\r\nshell (mother of pearl) to overlapping of successive layers, like the\r\noverlapping of shingles on a roof. This gives rise to a lined surface,\r\nmuch like the diffraction grating of the physicist, which is made by\r\nruling a glass plate with thousands of parallel lines to the inch. Such\r\na grating produces wonderful spectra, in which the rainbow colors are\r\nwidely separated and very vivid. The principal on which this separation\r\nof light depends is known as diffraction and cannot be explained here,\r\nbut a similar effect takes place when light falls on the naturally ruled\r\nsurface of a pearl and helps produce the play of colors known as\r\niridescence. The thin layers themselves also help to produce the\r\niridescence by interference of light much as in the case of the opal,\r\nwhich has already been discussed.\r\n\r\nCOLOR. Having explained the cause of the orient and water of pearls, the\r\n_color_ must next be considered. Pearls may be had of almost any color,\r\nbut the majority of fine pearls are white, or nearly so. The fine\r\nOriental pearls frequently have a creamy tint. Among fresh water pearls\r\nthe creamy tint is less often seen, but fine pink tints occur.\r\nOccasionally a black pearl is found and on account of its rarity\r\ncommands a price nearly as great as that obtainable for a white pearl of\r\nsimilar size and quality.\r\n\r\nThe value of pearls depends upon several different factors and it is far\r\nfrom an easy matter to estimate the value of a fine specimen. It is much\r\neasier to grade and estimate the value of diamonds than to do the same\r\nfor pearls, and it is only by long and intimate acquaintance with the\r\npearls themselves that one can hope to become expert in deciding values.\r\nThere are, however, several general factors that govern the value of\r\npearls. Chief among these are: 1, _Orient_; 2, _Color_; 3, _Texture or\r\nSkin_; 4, _Shape and Size_.\r\n\r\nFACTORS GOVERNING THE VALUE OF PEARLS. Taking up each of these factors\r\nin turn, it may be said of the first that unless a pearl has that fine\r\nkeen luster known as a fine orient, it is of but limited value. No\r\nmatter what the size, or how perfect the shape, it is nothing, if dead\r\nand lusterless. To have great value the gem must gleam with that soft\r\nbut lively luster peculiar to fine specimens of pearl. With variations\r\nin orient go wide variations in value.\r\n\r\nAs to _color_, the choicest pearls are pure white or delicate rose pink\r\nor creamy white. Pearls in these shades can be had in numbers and these\r\ncolors are what might be called _regular_ colors. _Fancy-colored_ pearls\r\nhave peculiar and irregular values, depending a good deal upon rarity\r\nand upon the obtaining of a customer for an odd color. Fine pink and\r\nfine black pearls are examples of the type that is meant here.\r\n\r\nTo be very valuable a pearl must have a smooth even _skin_, that is, the\r\n_texture_ of its surface must be even and regular. It must not have pits\r\nor scratches or wrinkles, or little raised spots upon it, or any cracks\r\nin it. In connection with this topic of \"skin,\" it may be mentioned that\r\nit is sometimes true that a pearl of bad skin or of poor luster may be\r\nimproved markedly by \"peeling\" it, as the process is called. As was said\r\nabove, a pearl is built in layers much like an onion, and it can often\r\nbe peeled, that is, one or more layers can be removed, thus exposing\r\nfresh layers beneath, whose texture and luster may be better than those\r\nof the original outside layer.\r\n\r\n\"PEELING\" A PEARL. Possibly an anecdote of an actual case may serve best\r\nto explain the method by which \"peeling\" is sometimes accomplished. The\r\nwriter was once at Vincennes, Ind., on business, and there became\r\nacquainted with a pearl buyer who was stopping at that place to buy\r\nfresh water pearls and \"slugs\" from the rivermen who gather the mussels\r\nfor the sake of their shells. The latter are made into \"pearl\" buttons\r\nfor clothing. It happened that the pearl buyer had accumulated some\r\ntwenty-eight ounces of slugs and a number of pearls and was leaving on\r\nthe same train with the author, who shared his seat with him. While we\r\nwere looking over the slugs together the pearl buyer put his hand in his\r\npocket and drew out a five-dollar bill which he unrolled, exposing a\r\npearl of about six grains, well shaped, but of rather dead luster.\r\nRemarking that he had paid but $4 for it and that he had rolled it up in\r\nthe bill for safe keeping until he got time to peel it, he took out a\r\nsmall penknife, opened one of the blades, put a couple of kid glove\r\nfinger tips on the thumb and first finger of his left hand and proceeded\r\nto peel the pearl on the moving train. Holding his two hands together to\r\nsteady them, he pressed the edge of his knife blade against the pearl\r\nuntil the harder steel had penetrated straight down through one layer.\r\nThen with a flaking, lateral motion he flaked off a part of the outer\r\nskin. Bit by bit all of the outer layer was flaked off, and that, too,\r\nwithout appreciably scratching the next layer, so great was the worker's\r\nskill. When the pearl was completely peeled it was gently rubbed with\r\nthree grades of polishing paper, each finer than the previous one, and\r\nthen the writer was allowed to examine it. The appearance had been much\r\nimproved, although it was not of extremely fine quality even when\r\npeeled. Under a high power magnifier scarcely a trace of the peeling\r\ncould be seen. The value of the $4 pearl had been raised to at least\r\n$100 and not many minutes had been required for the change. A slower and\r\nmore laborious, but safer, process of \"peeling\" a pearl, consists in\r\ngently rubbing the surface with a very fine, rather soft, abrasive\r\npowder until all of the outer skin has been thus worn away.\r\n\r\nOf course, in many such cases no better skin than the outer one could\r\nbe found and disappointment would result from the peeling of such a\r\npearl. It should be added that it will not do to try to peel a _part_ of\r\na pearl in order to remove an excrescence, for then one would inevitably\r\ncut across the layers, exposing their edges, and such a surface looks,\r\nwhen polished, much like a pearl button, but not like a pearl.\r\n\r\nIn this connection may be mentioned the widespread belief on the part of\r\nthe public that the concretions found in the common edible oyster can be\r\npolished by a lapidary, as a rough precious stone can be improved by the\r\nlatter, and that a fine pearl will result. It is frequently necessary\r\nfor jewelers to whom such \"pearls\" are brought, to undeceive the person\r\nbringing them and to tell him that only those molluscs that have a\r\nbeautiful pearly lining to their shells are capable of producing true\r\npearls and that the latter require no assistance from the lapidary.\r\n\r\nSHAPE. To return to the topic of factors governing the value of pearls,\r\nthe _shape_ of the pearl makes a vast difference in the value. Perfectly\r\nspherical pearls are most highly valued and closely following come those\r\nof drop or pear shape, as this shape lends itself nicely to the making\r\nof pendants. Oval or egg-shaped pearls are also good. After these come\r\nthe button shapes, in which one side is flattened. Pearls of irregular\r\nshape are much less highly valued. The irregular-shaped pearls are\r\ncalled _baroque_ pearls in the trade. The rivermen engaged in the fresh\r\nwater pearl fishery call them _slugs_. Some of the more regular of these\r\nare called \"nuggets.\" Others are termed \"spikes\" because of their\r\npointed shape, and still others are called \"wing\" pearls on account of\r\ntheir resemblance to a bird's wing. Most of the baroques are too\r\nirregular in shape to have any special name applying to their form.\r\n\r\nWEIGHT. After orient, color, skin, and shape have been considered,\r\n_size_ or _weight_ finally determines the value. Pearls are sold by an\r\narbitrary unit of weight known as the _pearl grain_. It is not equal to\r\nthe grain avoirdupois, but is one fourth of a diamond carat. As the new\r\nmetric carat is one fifth of a gram and as there are 15.43 avoirdupois\r\ngrains in a gram, it is seen at once that there are but 3.08 real grains\r\nin a carat rather than four. Thus the _pearl grain_ is slightly lighter\r\nthan the avoirdupois grain.\r\n\r\nSince large, fine pearls are exceedingly rare, the value mounts with\r\nsize much more rapidly than is the case with any other gem; in fact, the\r\nvalue increases as the _square_ of the weight. For example, let us\r\nconsider two pearls, one of one grain weight, the other of two grains,\r\nand both of the same grade as to quality. If the smaller is worth say $2\r\nper grain, then the larger is worth 2 × 2 (the square of the weight)\r\ntimes $2 (the _price per grain base_, as it is called in the trade),\r\nwhich totals $8. A four-grain pearl of this grade would be worth\r\n4 × 4 × $2 = $32, etc. Thus it is seen that the price increases very\r\nrapidly with increase in weight.\r\n\r\nPRICE \"PER GRAIN BASE.\" Some of the lower grades of pearls in small\r\nsizes are sold by the grain _straight_, that is, the price per grain is\r\nmerely multiplied by the weight in grains to get the value, just as the\r\nprice per carat would be multiplied by the number of carats to get the\r\nvalue of a diamond. This method of figuring the value of pearls is used\r\nonly for the cheaper grades and small sizes, however, and the method\r\nfirst explained, the calculation per grain _base_, is the one in\r\nuniversal use for fine gems. Very fine exceptional gems may be sold at a\r\nlarge price _for the piece_, regardless of the weight.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note in this connection that Tavernier, the French\r\ngem merchant of the seventeenth century, tells us that in his day the\r\nprice of large diamonds was calculated by a method similar to that which\r\nwe now use for pearls, that is, the weight in carats was squared and the\r\nproduct multiplied by the price per carat. Such a method would give far\r\ntoo high a price for diamonds to-day.\r\n\r\nTHE HIGH PRICE OF FINE PEARLS. This suggests the thought that pearls of\r\nfine quality and great size are the most costly of all gems to-day and\r\nyet there seems to be no halting in the demand for them. In fact,\r\nAmerica is only just beginning to get interested in pearls and is coming\r\nto esteem them as they have long been esteemed in the East and in\r\nEurope. Those who have thought that the advance in the prices of\r\ndiamonds in recent years will soon put them at prohibitive rates should\r\nconsider the enormous prices that have been obtained and are being\r\nobtained for fine pearls.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate the calculating of prices of pearls, tables have\r\nbeen computed and published giving the values of pearls of all sizes at\r\ndifferent prices _per grain base_, and several times these tables have\r\nbeen outgrown, and new ones, running to higher values, have been made.\r\nThe present tables run to $50 per grain base.\r\n\r\nThere is much justification for the high prices demanded and paid for\r\nlarge and fine pearls. Such gems are really exceedingly scarce. Those\r\nwho, as boys, have opened hundreds of river mussels only to find a very\r\nfew small, badly misshapen \"slugs\" will realize that it is only one\r\nmollusc in a very large number that contains a fine pearl. Moreover,\r\nlike the bison and the wild pigeon, the pearl-bearing molluscs may be\r\ngreatly diminished in numbers or even exterminated by the greed of man\r\nand his fearfully destructive methods of harvesting nature's\r\nproductions. In fact, the fisheries have been dwindling in yield for\r\nsome time, and most of the fine pearls that are marketed are _old_\r\npearls, already drilled, from the treasuries of Eastern potentates, who\r\nhave been forced by necessity to accept the high prices offered by the\r\nWest for part of their treasures. In India, pearls have long been\r\nacceptable collateral for loans, and many fine gems have come on the\r\nmarket after failure of the owners to repay such loans.\r\n\r\nHaving considered the factors bearing on the value of pearls, we will\r\nnext consider briefly their physical properties. The specific gravity is\r\nless definite than with minerals and varies between 2.65 and 2.70. It\r\nmay be even higher for pink pearls.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL PROPERTIES. In hardness pearls also vary, ranging between 3-1/2\r\nand 4 on Mohs's scale. They are thus very soft and easily worn or\r\nscratched by hard usage. A case showing the rather rapid wearing away of\r\npearls recently came to the attention of the writer. A pendant in the\r\nshape of a Latin cross had been made of round pearls which had been\r\ndrilled and strung on two slender gold rods to form the cross. The\r\npearls were free to rotate on the wires. After a period of some twenty\r\nor more years of wear the pearls had all become distinctly cylindrical\r\nin shape, the rubbing against the garments over which the pendant had\r\nbeen worn having been sufficient to grind away the soft material to that\r\nextent. The luster was still good, the pearls having virtually been\r\n\"peeled\" very slowly by abrasion.\r\n\r\nCARE OF PEARLS. This example suggests the great care that should be\r\ntaken by owners of fine pearls to prevent undue rubbing or wear of these\r\nvaluable but not extremely durable gems. They should be carefully wiped\r\nafter being worn to remove dust and then put away in a tightly closed\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nPearls should never be allowed to come in contact with any acid, not\r\neven weak acids like lemonade, or punch or vinegar, as, being largely\r\ncalcium carbonate they are very easily acted upon by acids, and a mere\r\ntouch with an acid might ruin the surface luster. Being partly organic\r\nin nature, pearls are not everlasting, but must eventually decay, as is\r\nshown by the powdery condition of very old pearls that have been found\r\nwith mummies or in ancient ruins. The organic matter has yielded to\r\nbacterial attack and decayed, leaving only the powdery mineral matter\r\nbehind. As heat and moisture are the conditions most conducive to the\r\ngrowth of bacteria, and hence to decay, it would follow that fine pearls\r\nshould be kept in a dry cool place when not in use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXVIII\r\n\r\nCULTURED PEARLS AND IMITATIONS OF PEARLS\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTURED PEARLS. Like all very valuable gems, pearls have stimulated the\r\ningenuity of man to attempt to make imitations that would pass for\r\ngenuine. Perhaps the most ingenious, as well as the most natural looking\r\nproduct, is the \"_cultured pearl_.\" This is really natural pearl on much\r\nof its exterior, but artificial within and at the back. In order to\r\nbring about this result the Japanese, who originated the present\r\ncommercial product, but who probably borrowed the original idea from the\r\nChinese, call to their assistance the pearl oyster itself. The oysters\r\nare gently opened, small hemispherical discs of mother-of-pearl are\r\nintroduced between shell and mantle and the oyster replanted. The\r\nforeign material is coated by the oyster with true pearly layers as\r\nusual, and after several years a sufficiently thick accumulation of\r\npearly layers is thus deposited on the nucleus so that the oyster may be\r\ngathered and opened and the cultured pearl removed by sawing it out from\r\nthe shell to which it has become attached. To the base is then neatly\r\ncemented a piece of mother-of-pearl to complete a nearly spherical\r\nshape, and the portions of the surface that have not been covered with\r\ntrue pearl are then polished. The product, when set in a proper pearl\r\nmounting, is quite convincing and really beautiful.\r\n\r\nAs the time during which the oyster is allowed to work upon the cultured\r\npearl is doubtless far less than is required for the growth of a large\r\nnatural pearl, the number of layers of true pearly material is\r\nconsiderably smaller than the number of layers that take part in the\r\nmultiple reflections explained in the previous lesson, and hence the\r\n\"orient\" of the cultured pearl is never equal to that of a fine true\r\npearl. It is frequently very good however, and for uses that do not\r\ndemand exposure of the whole surface of the pearl, the cultured pearl\r\nsupplies a substitute for genuine pearls of moderate quality and price.\r\nThe back parts of the cultured pearl, being only polished\r\nmother-of-pearl, have the appearance of the ordinary pearl button,\r\nrather than that of true pearl.\r\n\r\nIMITATIONS OF PEARLS. Aside from these half artificial cultured pearls,\r\nthe out and out imitations of pearls that have been most successfully\r\nsold are of two general types, first \"_Roman pearls_,\" and, second,\r\n\"_Indestructible pearls_.\" The Roman pearls are made hollow and\r\nafterward wax filled, the Indestructible pearls have solid enamel bases.\r\nIn both types the pearly appearance is obtained by lining the interior,\r\nor coating the exterior, with more or less numerous layers of what is\r\nknown as \"_nacre_\" or some times as \"_essence d'oriente_.\" This is\r\nprepared from the scales of a small fish found in the North Sea and in\r\nRussia. The scales are removed and treated with certain solutions which\r\nremove the silvery powder from the scales. The \"_nacre_\" is then\r\nprepared from this powder. The fineness of the pearly effect becomes\r\ngreater as the preparation ages, so very fine imitations are usually\r\nmade from old \"_nacre_.\" The effect is also better the larger the number\r\nof successive layers used. The artificial pearl thus resembles the true\r\npearl in the physical causes for the beautiful effect.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the Roman pearl has a true iridescence which is produced\r\nby \"burning\" colors into the hollow enamel bead. Some of the\r\nindestructible pearls are made over beads of opalescent glass, thus\r\nimparting a finer effect to the finished product. While the cheaper\r\ngrades of indestructible pearls have but three or four layers of nacre,\r\nsome of the fine ones have as many as thirty or more. The earlier\r\nindestructible pearls were made with a coating material which was\r\neasily affected by heat, or by water, or by perspiration, as a\r\ngelatine-like sizing was included in it. The more recent product has a\r\nmineral binder which is not thus affected, so that the \"pearls\" are\r\nreally about as durable as natural ones, and will at least last a\r\nlifetime if used with proper care.\r\n\r\nLike fine natural pearls, the fine imitations should be wiped after use\r\nand carefully put away. They should also be restrung occasionally, as\r\nshould real pearls both to prevent loss by the breaking of the string\r\nand because the string becomes soiled after a time, and this hurts the\r\nappearance of the jewel.\r\n\r\nThe \"Roman\" type of imitation will not stand much heat, as the wax core\r\nwould melt and run out.\r\n\r\nTESTING IMITATIONS OF PEARLS. As the making of imitations of pearls is\r\nmainly hand-work and as many treatments are required for the best\r\nimitations, fairly high prices are demanded for these better products,\r\nand the appearance and permanency warrant such prices. The best\r\nimitation pearls are really very difficult of detection except by close\r\nexamination. They will not, of course, stand inspection under a high\r\nmagnification.\r\n\r\nArtificial pearls may also be detected by their incorrect specific\r\ngravity, by their incorrect degree of hardness, and in the case of the\r\nhollow pearls by making a tiny ink spot upon the surface of the \"pearl\"\r\nand looking at it through a lens. A reflection of the spot from the\r\n_inside_ surface of the bead will appear beside the spot itself if the\r\npearl is of the Roman type.\r\n\r\nThe artificial pearls so far described are high class products. Some of\r\nthe very cheap and poor imitations are merely solid, or hollow, glass or\r\nenamel beads which have been made slightly pearly, either by adding\r\nvarious materials to the glass or enamel when it was made, or by crudely\r\ncoating the beads without or within with wax containing cheap \"nacre.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF BALANCES AND THE UNIT OF WEIGHT IN USE FOR PRECIOUS STONES\r\n\r\n\r\nAs precious stones are almost always sold by weight, and as the value at\r\nstake is frequently very great, it is almost as necessary for a gem\r\nmerchant, as it is for the chemist, to have delicate balances and to\r\nkeep them in good order and to use them skillfully.\r\n\r\nA general understanding of the unit of weight in use for precious stones\r\nand how it is related to other standard weights is also necessary to the\r\ngem dealer. We will therefore consider in this lesson the use and care\r\nof balances and the nature and relative value of the unit of weight for\r\nprecious stones.\r\n\r\nDELICATE BALANCES NEEDED. As it is necessary, on account of their great\r\nvalue, to weigh some gems, such as diamonds, emeralds, rubies, etc.,\r\nwith accuracy to at least the one hundredth part of a carat (which is\r\nroughly in the neighborhood of 1/15,000 of an ounce avoirdupois),\r\nbalances of very delicate and accurate construction are a necessary part\r\nof the equipment of every gem merchant. While portable balances of a\r\nfair degree of accuracy are to be had, the best and surest balances are\r\nsubstantially constructed and housed in glass cases, much as are those\r\nof the analytic chemist, which must do even finer weighing. The case\r\nprotects the balance from dust and dirt and prevents the action of air\r\ncurrents during the weighing. The balance itself has very delicate knife\r\nedges, sometimes of agate, sometimes of hardened steel, and these knife\r\nedges rest, when in use, on a block of agate or steel, so that there is\r\na minimum amount of friction. When not in use the balance beam and knife\r\nedges are lifted from the block and held firmly by a metal arm, or else,\r\nas is the case with some balances, the post supporting the block is\r\nlowered, leaving the beam and knife edges out of contact with it. The\r\nobject of this separation is to prevent any rough contact between the\r\nknife edges and the block on which they rest. Advantage should always be\r\ntaken of this device whenever any fairly heavy load is put on or taken\r\noff of either pan, as the sudden tipping of the beam might chip the\r\nknife edges if not supported. When the load is nearly balanced there may\r\nbe no harm in carefully adding or removing small weights while the knife\r\nedges are resting on the block, but even then it is safer to lower the\r\nbeam and pans. It should be needless to state that as level and rigid a\r\nsupport should be had for one's balance as circumstances permit.\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF USE OF BALANCES. Before using a balance one should see that\r\nthe pans are clean, that the base of the balance is properly leveled\r\n(the better balances have a spirit level attached) and that the pans\r\nbalance each other without load. When slightly out of balance the\r\ndefect may be adjusted by _unscrewing_ the little adjusting nut at the\r\nend of the beam that is too light, or by _screwing in_ the nut at the\r\nopposite end. Having seen that the adjustment is perfect the pans should\r\nbe lowered and the object to be weighed placed on the _left-hand pan_\r\n(because a right-handed person will find it handier to handle his\r\nweights on the right-hand pan). One should next guess as nearly as\r\npossible the weight of the stone and place well back on the right-hand\r\npan the weight that he thinks comes nearest to that of the stone. If the\r\nweight is too heavy the next lighter weight should replace it. Smaller\r\nweights should be added until a perfect balance is had, the small\r\nweights being neatly arranged in the order of their size, in order to\r\nmore rapidly count them when the stone is balanced. This is the case\r\nwhen the pointer swings approximately equal distances to the right and\r\nto the left and there is then no need to wait for it to come to rest in\r\nthe center.\r\n\r\nIt is well to count the weights as they lie on the pan (which is easily\r\ndone if they have been arranged in descending order of size as suggested\r\nabove) then write down the total, and on removing the weights count\r\naloud as they are replaced in the box and note if the total checks that\r\nwhich was written down. It may seem unnecessary to be so careful in this\r\nmatter, but it is better to be over-careful than to make a mistake where\r\nevery hundredth of a carat may mean from one to five or six dollars or\r\nmore. No dealer can afford to have a stone that he has sold prove to be\r\nlighter than he has stated it to be. One should be at least within one\r\none-hundredth of a carat of the correct weight.\r\n\r\nIt should be unnecessary to add that accurate weights _should never be\r\nhandled with the fingers_. Ivory tipped forceps are best for handling\r\nthe weights. The forceps commonly used for handling diamonds will, in\r\ntime, wear away the weights by scratching them so that they will weigh\r\nmaterially less. Unless the weights are of platinum or plated with\r\ngold, the perspiration of the hands would cause them to oxidize and gain\r\nin weight. It would be well to discard the smaller weights, which are\r\nmost in use, every few years and obtain new and accurate ones. In case\r\nthis is not done one should at least have the weights checked against\r\nothers known to be of standard weight. Any chemist will have balances\r\nand weights far more accurate than the best in use for precious stones\r\nand will gladly check the weights of a gem dealer for a moderate fee.\r\n\r\nTo check the accuracy of your balance, change the stone and weights to\r\nopposite pans, in which case they should still balance.\r\n\r\nOne should never overload a balance, both because the balance might be\r\ninjured and because the relative accuracy decreases as the load\r\nincreases. If the weight of a parcel of stones heavier than the total of\r\nthe weights provided with the balance is desired, the parcel should be\r\ndivided and weighed in parts.\r\n\r\nWhile many dealers neglect some of the precautions above suggested and\r\nsomehow get along, yet it is safer to use care and to have correct\r\ntechnique in the handling of one's balances.\r\n\r\nHaving indicated a few of the refinements of method in weighing we will\r\nnext consider the unit of weight in use for precious stones and see how\r\nit is related to other units of weight and in what manner it is\r\nsubdivided.\r\n\r\nTHE UNIT OF WEIGHT FOR PRECIOUS STONES. The present unit for precious\r\nstones in the United States is the _metric carat_. Most of the more\r\nprogressive countries have in recent years agreed upon the use of this\r\nunit. Its use in the United States became general July 1, 1913. It is by\r\ndefinition exactly one fifth of a _gram_ (the unit of weight of the\r\n_Metric System_ of weights and measures). Its relation to the _grain_ is\r\nthat there are 3.08+ grains in the metric carat. The carat in use in\r\nthis country up to a few years ago was about 2-1/2% heavier than the\r\npresent metric carat. It was equal to .2053 grams instead of .2000\r\ngrams (1/5 gram). The carats of countries not using the metric carat\r\nvary considerably, but yet approximate the metric carat somewhat nearly.\r\n\r\nThus, that in use in Great Britain was .2053 g., in Amsterdam .2057 g.,\r\nin Berlin .20544 g., in Lisbon .20575 g., and in Florence 0.1972 g. The\r\nlatter was the only one that was under the metric carat. The change to\r\nthe metric carat was desirable, as it unified the practice of weighing,\r\nwhich not only varied in different countries, but even in the same\r\ncountry. Thus there was no very exact agreement among the makers of\r\ndiamond weights in the United States prior to the adoption of the metric\r\ncarat. One man's carat was a bit heavier or lighter than another's. With\r\na definite and simple relationship to the standard gram there is now no\r\nexcuse for any variation in weights. The Bureau of Standards at\r\nWashington affords manufacturers every facility for standardizing their\r\nweights.\r\n\r\nTHE DECIMAL SYSTEM OF SUBDIVISION OF THE CARAT. With the adoption of the\r\nmetric carat the custom of expressing parts of a carat in common\r\nfractions whose denominators were powers of the number 2 (1/2, 1/4, 1/8,\r\n1/16, 1/32, 1/64) was discarded as awkward and slow for computation and\r\nthe decimal system of subdivision was adopted. Thus the metric carat is\r\ndivided into tenths and one hundredths. It is customary, however, to sum\r\nup the one hundredths and express them as the total number of one\r\nhundredths and not to express them as tenths. Thus, a stone of 2.57\r\ncarats is said to weigh \"two and fifty-seven hundredths carats.\" The\r\ndecimal system of subdivision of the carat makes the figuring of values\r\nsimpler where no tables are handy. Of course, new tables were at once\r\nprepared when the new carat was adopted and they afford a rapid means of\r\nascertaining the value of a stone of any weight when the price per carat\r\nis known. Should it become necessary to convert the weight of a stone\r\nfrom its expression in the old system to that of the new, one need only\r\nget 1.02-1/2% of the old weight. (The old carat was approximately .205\r\ng., while the new one is .200 g. Hence one old carat\r\n\r\n       .205   .102-1/2\r\n    is ---- = -------- = 102-1/2% of a new one.)\r\n       .200     .100\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF CONVERTING WEIGHTS. If the old weight has fractions these\r\nshould first be changed to decimals for convenience. For example,\r\nsuppose it is wished to change 2-1/4 1/16 old carats to metric carats.\r\n1/4 = .25 and 1/16 = .0625. Hence 2-1/4 1/16 = 2.3125. Now get 102-1/2%\r\nof this: (2.3125 × 1.025 = 2.37 metric carats).\r\n\r\nIf, for any reason one should need to change from metric carats to old\r\nU. S. carats one should multiply by .9756\r\n\r\n    ( .200 g.         )\r\n    ( ------- = .9756 )\r\n    ( .205 g.         )\r\n\r\nAs was said in Lesson XXV., pearls are sold by the _pearl grain_, which\r\nis arbitrarily fixed at 1/4 of a carat. With the change to the metric\r\ncarat the pearl grain was correspondingly changed and its weight is now\r\n1/4 of .200 g. = .05 g., as expressed in the metric system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXX\r\n\r\nTARIFF LAWS ON PRECIOUS AND IMITATION STONES\r\n\r\n\r\nSince it is necessary for a nation, as well as for an individual, to\r\nhave an income, and since articles of luxury are more easily taxed than\r\nare those of necessity, the traffic in gems and their imitations has\r\nfrequently been made a source of revenue to our government. Usually the\r\nper cent. charged as tariff has been comparatively low, especially upon\r\nvery valuable gems, such as diamonds and pearls, for the reason that too\r\nhigh a tariff would tend to tempt unscrupulous dealers to smuggle such\r\ngoods into the country without declaring them. When the margin of\r\ndifference between the values, with and without the tariff, is kept\r\nsmall the temptation is but slight, when the danger of detection and\r\nthe drastic nature of the usual punishment are taken into account. Rough\r\nstones have frequently been allowed to enter the country duty free\r\nbecause they were regarded as desirable raw materials which would afford\r\nemployment to home industry.\r\n\r\nThe tariff laws of October 3, 1913, made, however, some sweeping changes\r\nin the policy of our government toward precious stones and as those laws\r\nare still in force (April 4, 1917) this lesson will attempt to set forth\r\nclearly the exact conditions under the present law.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the paragraph of first importance to the trade is No. 357 which\r\nreads as follows.\r\n\r\n\"357. Diamonds and other precious stones, rough or uncut, and not\r\nadvanced in condition or value from their natural state by cleaving,\r\nsplitting, cutting, or other process, whether in their natural form or\r\nbroken, and bort; any of the foregoing not set, and diamond dust, 10 per\r\ncentum ad valorem; pearls and parts thereof, drilled or undrilled, but\r\nnot set or strung; diamonds, coral, rubies, cameos, and other precious\r\nstones and semi-precious stones, cut but not set, and suitable for use\r\nin the manufacture of jewelry, 20 per centum ad valorem; imitation\r\nprecious stones, including pearls and parts thereof, for use in the\r\nmanufacture of jewelry, doublets, artificial, or so-called synthetic or\r\nreconstructed, pearls and parts thereof, rubies, or other precious\r\nstones, 20 per centum ad valorem.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the chief changes over the previous law are\r\nfirst that which imposes a 10% duty on rough precious stones, which were\r\nformerly free of duty, and second the advance in the duty on cut\r\ndiamonds and other cut stones from the former 10% to the present 20%.\r\n\r\nThis increase in the tariff was regarded as unwise by many conservative\r\nimporters, as the temptation to defraud the government is made much\r\ngreater than before. The change was even feared by honest dealers who\r\nwere afraid that they could not successfully compete with dishonest\r\nimporters who might smuggle gems into the country. In spite of a rather\r\ndetermined opposition the change was made and our most representative\r\ndealers have been making the best of the situation and have been doing\r\nall that they could to help prevent smuggling or at least reduce it to a\r\nminimum. Through their knowledge of the movements of diamond stocks and\r\nof prices they are able to detect any unduly large supply or any\r\nunwarranted lowness of price and thus to assist the government agents by\r\ndirecting investigation towards any dealer who seems to be enjoying\r\nimmunity from the tariff.\r\n\r\nThe question of the status of Japanese cultured pearls has been settled\r\nas follows. Paragraph 357 (quoted above) is ruled to cover them and they\r\nare thus subject to a 20% ad valorem tax.\r\n\r\nCarbonadoes--miners' diamonds--are free of duty, under paragraph 474.\r\nCrude minerals are also free of duty, paragraph 549. Paragraph 607\r\ndeclares \"Specimens of natural history and mineralogy\" are free.\r\n\r\nIn case the owner is not prepared to pay the tax on imported merchandise\r\nthe government holds the goods for a period of three years pending such\r\npayments.\r\n\r\nIn case an importer shows that imported merchandise was purchased at\r\nmore than actual market value, he may deduct the difference at time of\r\nentry and pay duty only on the wholesale foreign market value, under\r\nSection III., paragraph 1.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the examiner finds merchandise to be undervalued\r\non the invoice, such merchandise is subject to additional penal duties,\r\nbut in case of disagreement between the importer and the examiner as to\r\nthe actual market value, appeal may be taken to the Customs Court.\r\n\r\nSince the Philippine Islands are possessions of the United States,\r\npearls from those islands may be admitted free of duty when the facts\r\nof their origin are certified to.\r\n\r\nIn the case of precious stones which had their origin in the United\r\nStates, but which were exported and kept for a time abroad it has been\r\nruled that such stones may be imported into the United States free of\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nWhen precious or imitation precious stones are imported into the United\r\nStates and subsequently mounted into jewelry which is then exported, the\r\nduty which was paid upon entry may be refunded less a deduction of 1%.\r\n\r\nThe author wishes to extend his thanks to Examiner W. B. Treadwell of\r\nNew York, for his assistance in regard to the subject dealt with in this\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe student of gems will, of course, want to read many books on the\r\nsubject and the following brief bibliography will enable the beginner to\r\nselect his reading wisely from the start. Much more complete\r\nbibliographies will be found in some of the books listed here, one which\r\nis notably complete to date of publication is contained in _Diamonds and\r\nPrecious Stones_, by Harry Emanuel, F.R.G.S., London, John Camden\r\nHotten, 1867. This covers many languages.\r\n\r\nThe book which will probably be found most useful by those who have\r\nmastered this little text is the work by G. F. Herbert-Smith, to which\r\nfrequent reference has been made at the close of many of our chapters.\r\nIt is thoroughly scientific, yet understandable, and is very complete on\r\nthe scientific side of the subject.\r\n\r\n_Gem-Stones_, G. F. Herbert-Smith, Jas. Pott & Co., N. Y.\r\n\r\nFor another work and one which contains information of trade character\r\nas well as scientific information about gems see _Precious Stones_ by W.\r\nR. Cattelle, J. B. Lippincott & Co., Phila., or see _A Handbook of\r\nPrecious Stones_, by M. D. Rothschild, G. P. Putnam's Sons, N. Y.\r\n\r\n_Gems and Gem Minerals_, by Oliver Cummings Farrington, A. W. Mumford,\r\npublisher, Chicago, 1903, is another good general work on gems. Its\r\ncolor plates of rough gem minerals are especially good.\r\n\r\nThose who are especially interested in the diamond should see _The\r\nDiamond_ by W. R. Cattelle, The John Lane Co., N. Y., which gives a good\r\naccount of its subject and is rich in commercial information, or\r\n_Diamonds: A Study of the Factors which Govern their Value_, by the\r\npresent author, G. P. Putnam's Sons, N. Y., 1914.\r\n\r\nSir Wm. Crook's, the _Diamond_, Harper & Bros., N. Y., is very\r\ninteresting, especially in its account of the author's visits to the S.\r\nAfrican mines.\r\n\r\nStudents of pearls will find _The Book of the Pearl_, by Dr. Geo. F.\r\nKunz and Dr. Chas. Stevenson, Century Co., N. Y., very complete. A\r\nsmaller work, yet a good one, on pearls is _The Pearl_ by W. R.\r\nCattelle, J. B. Lippincott & Co., Phila., 1907. This book is strong on\r\nthe commercial side.\r\n\r\nAn older work is _Pearls and Pearling_ by D. Edwin Streeter, Geo. Bell &\r\nCo., London.\r\n\r\nA work on gems and gem-cutting by a practical cutter is _The Gem\r\nCutter's Craft_, by Leopold Claremont, Geo. Bell & Sons, London, but it\r\nshould be said that very few trade secrets will be found exposed in the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of scientific precious stones _The Production and\r\nIdentification of Artificial Precious Stones_, by Noel Heaton, B.Sc.,\r\nF.C.S., read before the Royal Society of Arts, Apr. 26, 1911, is very\r\nfine. It may be had in the annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution\r\nfor 1911, p. 217. It gives one of the best accounts to be had of the\r\nhistory of the artificial production of precious stones, especially of\r\nthe corundum gems. It also contains a splendid account of how to\r\ndistinguish scientific from natural gems.\r\n\r\nMost students of gems will need to refer frequently to some good\r\ntext-book of mineralogy. Although old, Dana's _Mineralogy_ is still a\r\nstandard work. A newer book and one of a more popular nature is L. P.\r\nGratacap's _The Popular Guide to Minerals_, D. Van Nostrand & Co., N. Y.\r\n\r\nAmong larger and more expensive books on gems may be mentioned _Precious\r\nStones_, by Dr. Max Bauer. This is an English translation of a German\r\nwork which is a classic in its field. As it is now out of print in its\r\nEnglish edition, a somewhat detailed account of its character may be of\r\nvalue to those who may be inclined to go to the effort to seek a copy at\r\na public library or perhaps to purchase one through second-hand book\r\nstores.\r\n\r\nA popular account of their characters, occurrence and applications, with\r\nan introduction to their determination, for mineralogists, lapidaries,\r\njewelers, etc., with an appendix on pearls and coral, by Dr. Max Bauer,\r\nPrivy Councillor, professor in the Union of Marburg. Translated from the\r\nGerman by L. J. Spencer, M.A. (Cantab.), F.G.S., assistant in the\r\nmineral department of the British Museum. With twenty plates and\r\nninety-four figures in the text. London, Chas. Griffin & Co., Ltd.:\r\nPhila., J. B. Lippincott Co., 1904.\r\n\r\nThe book is a large one, xv + 627 pages, and is divided into three parts\r\nwith an appendix on pearls and coral.\r\n\r\nPart I. deals with the general characters of precious stones.\r\n\r\n    1. Natural characters and occurrence.\r\n    2. Applications of Precious Stones.\r\n    3. Classification of Precious Stones. 106 pages.\r\n\r\nPart II. Systematic Description of Precious Stones, Diamond, Corundum\r\nGems, Spinel, etc. 450 pages.\r\n\r\nPart III. Determination and Distinguishing of Precious Stones. 20 pages.\r\n\r\nAppendix, 26 pages. Pearls and Coral.\r\n\r\nBauer is exhaustive in his descriptions of the more important precious\r\nstones and he also describes briefly very many little known and little\r\nused gem minerals.\r\n\r\nOn forms of cutting he is old-fashioned.\r\n\r\nFirst 68 pages given to explanation of characters used in identifying\r\nstones. Good.\r\n\r\nOn the Process of Cutting. Pages 79-87. Good account. More practical\r\nthan most books give.\r\n\r\nCareful accounts of occurrence of precious stones with maps.\r\n\r\nCharacter of the occurrence of diamond in India, Brazil, and Africa,\r\nquite in detail.\r\n\r\nThe student who wishes to master the subject of gems cannot afford to\r\nneglect Bauer.\r\n\r\nFor those who read French, the latest, the most complete and thorough\r\nbook on gems is Jean Escard's _Les Pierres Précieuses_, H. Dunod et E.\r\nPinat, Paris, 1914.\r\n\r\nIt is a large and finely illustrated work.\r\n\r\nThe author has really outdone Bauer. The detail in regard to diamonds\r\nespecially is very fine. Even the use of diamonds in mechanical ways is\r\nvery completely gone into and also details in regard to cutting diamonds\r\nare very completely given. It is to be hoped that an English translation\r\nwill soon become available.\r\n\r\nAnother large and thoroughgoing work is Gardner F. Williams' _The\r\nDiamond Mines of South Africa_, MacMillan, N. Y.\r\n\r\nDr. Geo. F. Kunz's _Gems and Precious Stones of North America_, The Sci.\r\nPub. Co., N. Y., 1890, 336 pages, 8 colored plates (excellent ones too),\r\nmany engravings, is a very complete account of all published finds of\r\nprecious stones in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, giving a\r\npopular description of their value, history, archeology, and of the\r\ncollections in which they exist, also a chapter on pearls and on\r\nremarkable foreign gems owned in the United States. Many rare and little\r\nknown semi-precious stones are described here. Dr. Kunz is also the\r\nauthor of several more recent gem books notably _The Magic of Jewels and\r\nCharms_ and _The Curious Lore of Precious Stones_, Lippincott, Phila.\r\n\r\nAmong books on engraved gems is the old _Hand Book of Gem Engraving_ by\r\nC. W. King; Bell & Daldy, London, 1866, and one by Duffield Osborne;\r\nHenry Holt & Co., N. Y. Another book on this subject is _Engraved Gems_\r\nby Maxwell Somerville; Drexel Biddle, Phila.\r\n\r\nFor those who wish still further references the following older works\r\nwill prove interesting.\r\n\r\n_Precious Stones_, by W. R. Cattelle; Lippincott, Phila. _Precious\r\nStones_, by W. Goodchild; D. Van Nostrand & Co., N. Y.\r\n\r\nJulius Wodiska, of New York, has also written an interesting work on\r\nprecious stones, _A Book of Precious Stones_, Putnam's, 1907.\r\n\r\nStill older works are _Precious Stones and Gems_ by Edwin W. Streeter;\r\nChapman & Hall, London, 1877. This is a book of 264 pages with nine\r\nillustrations. It contains much of value and was unsurpassed in its day.\r\nIts first-hand accounts of numerous important, even celebrated diamonds\r\nand other precious stones will always make it valuable to the student of\r\ngems.\r\n\r\nAnother book by the same author is _The Great Diamonds of the World_;\r\nGeo. Bell & Sons, London, 1882; 321 pages. Not illustrated. Its title\r\nadequately describes its contents. It is an excellent work. The author\r\neven traveled in India tracing the history of some of the famous\r\ndiamonds that he describes.\r\n\r\n_Diamonds and Precious Stones_, by Louis Dieulafait published in its\r\nEnglish translation by Scribner, Armstrong & Co., N. Y., 1874, is\r\nanother old but interesting work. It has 292 pages and 126 engravings on\r\nwood. It gives a fine account of diamond cutting as practiced at that\r\ntime. There is also an excellent history of the production of artificial\r\nprecious stones to that date.\r\n\r\n_The Natural History of Precious Stones and of the Precious Metals_ by\r\nC. W. King, M.A., Bell & Daldy, London, 1870, is rich in references to\r\nclassical literature.\r\n\r\nOne or two interesting monographs on precious stones have been written\r\nand _The Tourmaline_, by Augustus C. Hamlin is one of these. Mr. Hamlin\r\nbecame interested in gems because of his accidental discovery of some of\r\nthe fine tourmalines of Maine. His _Leisure Hours among the Gems_ is\r\nalso very readable. Jas. R. Osgood & Co., Boston, 1884. It deals\r\nespecially with diamond, emerald, opal, and sapphire. He gives a good\r\naccount of American finds of diamond, and a long account of European\r\nregalia. The book is full of interesting comment and contains many\r\nreferences to older authors.\r\n\r\n_The Tears of the Heliades_ or _Amber as a Gem_, by W. Arnold Buffum, G.\r\nP. Putnam's Sons, N. Y., 1900, is as its name implies a monograph on\r\namber.\r\n\r\nA good work on the history of precious stones and on historical-jewels\r\nis _Gems and Jewels_ by Madame de Barrera; Richard Bentley, London,\r\n1860. It deals also with the geography of gem sources. An interesting\r\nchapter on \"Great Jewel Robberies\" is also included.\r\n\r\nOf still greater age but of great interest is John Mawe's old work, on\r\ndiamonds and precious stones. In it the author discusses in a\r\nconversational style that is very attractive much of the gem lore of his\r\nday and shows a profound knowledge of his subject, a knowledge that was\r\nevidently first hand and practical, _A Treatise on Diamonds and Precious\r\nStones_, by John Mawe, London. 2nd edition. Printed for and sold by the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nFor readers of French, Jean Baptiste Tavernier's _Voyages_, in six\r\nvolumes, will be vastly interesting. Tavernier made six journeys to\r\nIndia and the East between 1640 and 1680 as a gem merchant during which\r\ntime he purchased and brought back to Europe many celebrated gems\r\nincluding the famous French blue diamond which he sold to Louis XIV. and\r\nwhich was stolen at the robbery of the Garde Meuble during the French\r\nRevolution. Tavernier describes these famous stones and many others that\r\nhe was privileged to inspect in the treasuries of the Grand Mogul. He\r\nalso describes interestingly and at great length the curious manners and\r\ncustoms of the people of the East. _Les Six Voyages de Jean Baptiste\r\nTavernier_, etc., Nouvelle edition, Rouen, 1724.\r\n\r\nPliny's _Natural History_, to go much further back, is full of\r\nreferences to gems, and gem students should run through it (it is to be\r\nhad in English translation) for such interesting bits as that in which\r\nhe describes the belief that quartz crystal results from the effect of\r\nvery great cold upon ice, a belief which Pliny himself is careful not to\r\nsubscribe to. He contents himself with relating what others believe in\r\nthis regard.\r\n\r\nBoth the Hebrew scriptures and the New Testament afford many references\r\nto gems with which the eager student of the subject should be familiar.\r\n\"She is more precious than rubies\" (referring to wisdom) is but one of\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion the author hopes that this little text may lead a few

With 33 Full-page Illustrations and 4 Colored Plates_\r\n\r\n\r\nA description, in altogether a new fashion, of gems and gem minerals,\r\ntheir nature and history, comprehensible to every reader, and of prime\r\nvalue to students and to jewelers.\r\n\r\nThe general reader will enjoy the simple descriptions of the origin,\r\ndevelopment, and treatment of the diamond, sapphire, and other precious\r\nstones, as well as of the beautiful semi-precious stones. Just enough of\r\nthe technical has been provided to make the new gem book a _vade mecum_\r\nfor students of gem minerals and for the army of jewelers in the United\r\nStates, as well as their fellow-craftsmen and merchants in all\r\nEnglish-speaking places. The art and industry of mounting gems is\r\nsomewhat elaborately covered, especially as exemplified in the work of\r\nstudents at technical schools and the many unattached workers in jewelry\r\ndesigning and making who form a part of the Arts and Crafts movement.\r\nSome of the quaint superstitions about gems in the chapter on folklore\r\nhave a curious interest. The author takes cognizance of the public\r\ndesire nowadays for the novel and uncommon in gems, and shows that\r\nprospectors, gem miners, mineralogists, and jewelers are co-operating to\r\ngreatly lengthen the lists of popular semi-precious stones. A chapter is\r\ndevoted to collections of gems in museums.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nG. P.
