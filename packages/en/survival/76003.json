Many additions have also been\r\nmade to Chapter III. and the Becke method, for the determination of the\r\nrelative indices of refraction of minerals, has been given in detail.\r\n\r\nSome new and useful tables have been introduced; as tables of refractive\r\nindices (mean) and double refraction (maximum). A diagram has also been\r\nadded, showing the relation existing between strength of double\r\nrefraction, interference colors and thickness of section.\r\n\r\nProfessor E. Weinschenk’s admirable text-book, “Die Gesteinsbildenden\r\nMineralien”, Freiburg, 1901, has been specially referred to, and the\r\ntables of refractive indices and double refraction have been compiled\r\nfrom Weinschenk’s new Tables.\r\n\r\nMany new cuts have been added, among them being semi-ideal drawings,\r\nshowing typical outlines of crystal sections, cleavage, optical\r\norientation, etc. In describing the “Usual Appearance in Sections” of a\r\nmineral, it is of course only possible to mention the usual crystal form\r\nin which the mineral occurs in a rock. The crystal may be cut in any way\r\nby the plane of the section; but a general knowledge of the crystal\r\nforms will furnish an idea as to the outline, etc., that the mineral may\r\nshow in the section.\r\n\r\n                                                        LEA MCI.

This may be due to the fact that most of the\r\npublications on this subject are quite elaborate in their nature and in\r\neither French or German. While detailed descriptions are very necessary,\r\nand, in fact, indispensable for advanced investigation, they are apt to\r\nprove cumbersome and confusing at first. For these reasons this\r\ntext-book has been prepared by the writer, with a view of putting before\r\nthe student only those facts which are absolutely necessary for the\r\nproper recognition and identification of the common minerals in rock\r\nsections. The footnotes refer the student to standard publications, in\r\nwhich are given details of the methods and investigations outlined in\r\nthe text. An elementary knowledge of crystallography and mineralogy is\r\nalmost indispensable and is here assumed.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic and optical characters of the minerals are recorded in\r\nthe usual order in which they would be observed with a petrographical\r\nmicroscope. Nearly all the rock-forming minerals become transparent in\r\nthin sections; but when opaque, attention is called to the fact and the\r\ncharacters are recorded as seen with incident light. White light is\r\nassumed to be used, unless otherwise stated. The interference colors\r\nrecorded in all cases are those given by very thin sections of 0.03 mm.\r\nin thickness.\r\n\r\nThe order followed for the minerals is essentially that of Rosenbusch\r\n(based on the symmetry of the crystalline form), with a few exceptions\r\nmade for convenience, such as placing pyrrhotite after pyrite and\r\nzoisite after epidote. The statements regarding the occurrences of\r\nminerals in the common rock-types have been taken mainly from Les\r\nMinéraux des Roches, by Lévy and Lacroix.\r\n\r\nThe terms axes and directions of elasticity, used throughout this book,\r\nare very commonly employed in petrographical literature of the present\r\ntime. These axes and directions should probably more correctly be called\r\naxes and directions of vibration or extinction. The reasons for or\r\nagainst the elastic condition of the “ether” are of more interest,\r\nhowever, to the physicist than to the petrographer.\r\n\r\nAn optical scheme is appended, with the minerals grouped according to\r\ntheir common optical characters.\r\n\r\nThe writer’s thanks are due to Dr. A. J. Moses, Professor of Mineralogy,\r\nand to Mr. J. F. Kemp, Professor of Geology, for kind suggestions\r\noffered during the preparation of this book.\r\n\r\n                                                        LEA MCI.

A crystal of long prismatic habit, cut about parallel\r\nto the _ć_ axis, would show marked elongation; while a tabular crystal\r\n(like mica) would show elongation if cut at right angles to the tabular\r\nfaces. At times, of course, no elongation is appreciable, as in the case\r\nof granular or broken crystals or where the cross-section is essentially\r\nsquare or octagonal. Very often the relation of the cleavage is given to\r\nthe elongation and also to the directions a′ and c′, which makes it\r\npossible to test for a′ and c′ even when no marked elongation can be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MINERALS IN ROCK SECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n              INTRODUCTORY OPTICS FOR OPTICAL MINERALOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this introduction is merely to give a practical discussion\r\nof elementary optics, as applied to optical mineralogy,[3] and no\r\nelaborate discussion of this important subject will be attempted. The\r\nexplanations will be made as simple as possible, and, in most cases,\r\nonly the optical phenomena will be described without entering into a\r\ntheoretical discussion as to the cause of these phenomena.\r\n\r\n_Light_[4] may be regarded as transmitted in straight lines by\r\nvibrations of the “ether,” taking place at right angles to the direction\r\nof transmission.\r\n\r\n_Ordinary light_ is light with the ether vibrations in all possible\r\ndirections, the path described by any particle of ether constantly\r\nchanging.\r\n\r\n_Plane polarized light_ is simply light with the ether vibrations all\r\n_parallel_ to one plane passing through the direction of transmission.\r\n\r\nBy experiment it has been proved that there exists a very close relation\r\nbetween the optical properties of crystals and their other physical\r\nproperties, such as form, color, transmission of heat, etc. Therefore it\r\nis often possible, by a careful optical investigation of a crystal\r\nsection, to determine important crystallographic facts, even in the\r\nabsence of any distinct outline.\r\n\r\n\r\n         The Effects Produced by Crystals on Transmitted Light.\r\n\r\nConsider that a series of optical tests are made on all possible\r\nsections[5] of crystals in the six systems, and the manner in which\r\nthese crystals affect transmitted light ascertained.\r\n\r\n▄Isotropic Crystals▄: It will be found that all sections of _Isometric_\r\ncrystals transmit light with equal velocity in all directions; that is,\r\nthe crystals are optically equivalent in all directions and, hence, can\r\nproduce no double refraction.[6] In these crystals any section, however\r\ncut, will transmit all the rays of light, incident to the surface at\r\nright angles, with no change.[7] The same is true of _Amorphous_ bodies,\r\nglass, etc., unless they have been subjected to strains or peculiar\r\nconditions during cooling. A _single image_ is seen through these\r\nisotropic sections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1.\r\n]\r\n\r\n▄Anisotropic Crystals▄: It will also be found that nearly all sections\r\n(the exceptions being given later) of crystals in the remaining five\r\nsystems, produce quite a different effect on transmitted light. In these\r\ncrystals the velocity of transmission of light varies with the\r\n_vibration direction_ of the light rays. This property, called _double\r\nrefraction_,[8] seems to result from the power of resolving a ray of\r\nordinary light, with ether vibrations in all directions, into two rays\r\nwith ether vibrations in planes at right angles to each other; the two\r\nresulting rays traversing, usually, divergent paths in passing through\r\nthe section.\r\n\r\nThe mineral calcite (Iceland spar) exhibits this property to a marked\r\ndegree, and in certain sections will show a _double image_, Fig. 1. That\r\nthe vibration directions of the two doubly refracted rays are in planes\r\nat right angles to each other, can be easily proved by using a nicol\r\nprism.[9] In most cases the separation of the two images is so slight as\r\nnot to be perceived by the eye, and the practical method of testing a\r\ncrystal section for double refraction will be given later, p. 27.\r\n\r\nThe crystals that show double refraction are further divided into two\r\ngroups, _uniaxial_ and _biaxial_:\r\n\r\n(1) ▄Uniaxial▄, or those in which the optical characters are symmetrical\r\nto _one_ direction, called an optic axis. This _optic axis_ is the\r\ncrystallographic vertical axis, _ć_; and parallel to this direction\r\nthere is a single value only for the light velocity and no double\r\nrefraction takes place.[10] Hence any section parallel to the base (001)\r\nbeing at right angles to the optic axis, acts like a section of an\r\nisotropic crystal and transmits all the perpendicularly incident rays of\r\nlight with no change. In any other section double refraction takes place\r\nand it can be proved by using a nicol prism that the two rays have ether\r\nvibrations, one in the plane passing through the incident ray and the\r\n_ć_ axis of the crystal, and the other in a plane at right angles\r\nthereto, hence in the basal plane. This latter ray, which has a constant\r\nvelocity, is called the _ordinary ray O_; and the other ray, with\r\nvelocity varying with the inclination of the section to _ć_, is called\r\nthe _extraordinary ray E_.[11]\r\n\r\nThe vibration directions are either parallel or symmetrical to cleavage\r\ncracks and crystal outlines. In sections parallel to the optic axis, the\r\ntwo doubly refracted rays have the maximum difference in velocity of\r\ntransmission, and hence their vibration directions are called _principal\r\nvibration directions_[12] and the plane containing them an _optical\r\nprincipal section_. In these sections the refractive index of the ray\r\nvibrating parallel to _ć_ (extraordinary ray) is denoted by ε, and that\r\nof the ray vibrating parallel to the basal plane (ordinary ray) by\r\nω.[13]\r\n\r\nTo this group belong all _Tetragonal_ and _Hexagonal_ crystals.\r\n\r\n(2) ▄Biaxial▄, or those in which the optical characters are no longer\r\nsymmetrical to an optic axis but to three planes at right angles to each\r\nother (for monochromatic light). These crystals have, however (for light\r\nof each wave-length and for each temperature), _two_ directions parallel\r\nto which there is a single value only for the light velocity and hence\r\nno double refraction. These directions are called “_optic axes_.”[14] An\r\ninvestigation of these biaxial crystals shows that of all the rays\r\ntraversing these crystals there are three rays which advance with\r\nmaximum, minimum and some intermediate velocity. The vibration\r\ndirections of these three rays are called the _principal vibration\r\ndirections_ and are at right angles to each other (being the\r\nintersections of the three planes above referred to). The direction of\r\nether vibration of the fastest ray is denoted by a, of the slowest ray\r\nby c, and of the ray advancing with intermediate velocity by b.[15] Each\r\nof the three planes, containing two principal vibration directions, is\r\ncalled an _optical principal section_. The index of refraction of the a\r\nray is denoted by α, of the b ray by β, and of the c ray by γ.\r\n\r\nTo this group belong all crystals in the _Orthorhombic_, _Monoclinic_\r\nand _Triclinic_ systems.\r\n\r\nIn the _Orthorhombic_ system, the principal vibration directions are\r\nparallel to the crystallographic axes; hence all pinacoidal sections\r\ncontain two of these principal vibration directions. In all sections\r\nparallel to the three crystallographic axes _ă_, _ƃ_ and _ć_, the\r\nvibration directions are parallel or symmetrical to cleavage cracks,\r\ncrystal edges, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the _Monoclinic_ system, one principal vibration direction is\r\nparallel to the ortho axis _ƃ_, the other principal vibration directions\r\nare in the plane of symmetry, at right angles to _ƃ_, but are not\r\nparallel with either the vertical axis _ć_ or the clino axis _á_. In\r\nclino pinacoid (010) sections the principal vibration directions will\r\nmake definite angles with crystallographic lines, such as cleavages or\r\ncrystal outlines. These angles are called _extinction angles_. They will\r\nvary, in this system, with reference to the direction of the _ć_ axis\r\nfrom a maximum on the clino pinacoid (010) to 0° on the ortho pinacoid\r\n(100), when the vibration directions of the two doubly refracted rays\r\nwill be parallel and at right angles to the plane of symmetry. Hence the\r\nvibration directions are parallel or symmetrical to cleavages, edges,\r\netc., _only_ in sections parallel to the ortho axis _ƃ_; but in all\r\nother sections are unsymmetrical.\r\n\r\nIn the _Triclinic_ system, the principal vibration directions are not\r\nparallel to the crystallographic axes, and there is no definite relation\r\nbetween these directions and the crystallographic axes; hence in all\r\npossible sections there will be extinction angles.\r\n\r\nIn all biaxial crystals the two _optic axes_ are inclined to each other,\r\nmaking what is called the _axial angle, 2V_, the apparent angle measured\r\nin air being _2E_. The optic axes lie in the plane, called the _axial\r\nplane_, which contains the principal vibration directions a and c. The\r\naxial angles are bisected by these principal vibration directions, the\r\ndirection bisecting the acute angle being called the _acute bisectrix,\r\nBx_{a}_, and that bisecting the obtuse angle the _obtuse bisectrix,\r\nBx_{o}_. An approximate idea of the value of the axial angle can be\r\nobtained by the use of the petrographical microscope, as described\r\nlater, p. 47. The axial angle is often a convenient distinction between\r\nsuch minerals as muscovite and biotite.\r\n\r\nThe axial angle will vary with the temperature and with light of\r\ndifferent wave-length or color, and this variation is called\r\n_dispersion_ of the optic axes. Dispersion of the principal vibration\r\ndirections also takes place in monoclinic and triclinic crystals, but\r\ncan be usually disregarded.\r\n\r\nIn closing it is very important to remember that any section of an\r\nanisotropic crystal (not at right angles to an optic axis) will always\r\ntransmit two rays of light with different velocities and with vibration\r\ndirections in planes at right angles to each other. Isometric crystals,\r\nof course, produce no double refraction of light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                   THE PETROGRAPHICAL MICROSCOPE.[16]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _petrographical microscope_ is essentially an ordinary\r\nmicroscope[17] with the following important additional equipment. It\r\nmust be provided with: 1° a _polarizer_ (a piece of apparatus for giving\r\npolarized light) placed below the stage; 2° an _analyzer_ (a piece of\r\napparatus for analyzing the rays of light after they have passed through\r\nthe polarizer and transparent section) placed between the objective and\r\nthe eye; 3° a _stage rotating_ about an axis which is the line of sight\r\nof the microscope. A convenient type of microscope is that made by\r\nSeibert of Wetzlar (No. 11 _a_), Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nThe reflector _a_ is usually fitted with a plane mirror on one side, and\r\na parabolic mirror on the other. The plane mirror should be used with\r\nsunlight, and the parabolic mirror with artificial light, in order to\r\nmake the rays of light as nearly parallel as possible.\r\n\r\nThe _polarizer_ is in most cases a nicol prism, set in a suitable frame\r\n_b_, and made as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the _nicol prism_ “a cleavage rhombohedron of calcite (the variety\r\nIceland spar is universally used in consequence of its transparency) is\r\nobtained, having four large and two small rhombohedral faces opposite\r\neach other. In place of the latter planes, two new surfaces are cut,\r\nmaking angles of 68° (instead of 71°) with the obtuse vertical edges;\r\nthese then form the terminal faces of the prism. In addition to this,\r\nthe prism is cut through in the direction HH′, Fig. 3, the parts then\r\npolished and cemented together again with Canada balsam. A ray of light,\r\n_ab_, entering the prism, is divided into two rays polarized at right\r\nangles to each other. One of these, _bc_, on meeting the layer of balsam\r\n(whose refractive index is less than that of the ray _bc_), suffers\r\ntotal reflection, and is deflected against the blackened sides of the\r\nprism and extinguished. The other, _bd_, passes through and emerges at\r\n_e_, a completely polarized ray of light, that is, a ray with vibrations\r\nin one direction only, and that the direction of the shorter diagonal of\r\nthe prism.”[18] The vertical plane through the shorter diagonal may be\r\ncalled the _plane_ of _vibration_[19] of the nicol.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 2.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 3.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe polarizer must be below the stage _c_, and is generally adjusted so\r\nas to have its plane of vibration parallel to the N. and S. cross-wire\r\nin the eye-piece _o_. It is important to know the direction of the plane\r\nof vibration of the polarizer or lower nicol, as we can then determine,\r\nwhen absorption of light occurs in a mineral, the direction in this\r\nmineral parallel to which the absorbed rays are vibrating. The polarizer\r\nslides in an outer shell or frame, and, by means of a lever _d_, can\r\neasily be raised or lowered.\r\n\r\nA convenient test for the location of this plane of vibration of the\r\npolarizer is as follows: Make use of a section of biotite, cut at right\r\nangles to the basal plane, hence showing the basal cleavage cracks.\r\nBiotite has the property of absorbing to a marked extent the light\r\nvibrating parallel to these cleavage cracks. Rotate such a section on\r\nthe stage of the microscope until the position of maximum darkness is\r\nreached and when such is the case the plane of vibration of the\r\npolarizer must be parallel to these cleavage cracks.\r\n\r\nOn the top of the nicol is placed the _condensing lens_ for getting\r\n_convergent_ light, and the adjustments are so arranged that when the\r\nnicol is up as far as it will go, the condensing lens[20] is brought\r\nalmost in contact with the lower surface of the transparent section\r\nresting on the stage.\r\n\r\nThe _rotating_ circular _stage e_ is supported on a suitable frame _c_,\r\nand arranged so that its axis of rotation coincides with the line of\r\nsight of the microscope. The stage is graduated, and, by means of an\r\nindex fixed to the frame, the angular rotation can always be obtained.\r\nIt is also provided with two adjusting screws[21] _f_, by means of which\r\nthe axis of rotation can be accurately centered.\r\n\r\nThe method of centering is as follows: Bring some prominent mark in the\r\nsection exactly in coincidence with the intersection of the cross-wires\r\nin the eye-piece. Rotate the stage 180°, and correct one half the error\r\nby means of the centering screws, and the other half by moving the\r\nsection on the stage. Check the result by rotating the stage 180° again,\r\nand if necessary repeat the corrections in the same way until the\r\nadjustment is satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe _objective_[22] _g_ screws into the collar _h_, which has a slot\r\n_k_, in the upper portion, for the introduction of a sensitive color\r\nplate, a one quarter undulation mica plate or a quartz wedge.[23]\r\n\r\nThe slot _k_ is so arranged that, when the sensitive color plates are\r\nintroduced, the vibration directions of these plates will make an angle\r\nof 45° with the planes of vibration of the crossed nicols, and the\r\ninterference color will thus be at its maximum intensity.\r\n\r\nA revolving _nose-piece_ is sometimes used which can be attached to the\r\ncollar _h_ and arranged to carry two or three objectives, which can thus\r\nbe very quickly brought into position for use. This is convenient in\r\npassing rapidly from observations with parallel light to observations\r\nwith convergent light, which must be made with a high power objective.\r\nThe difficulty is that recentering is generally required. The modern\r\nmicroscopes are provided with a clip for holding the objectives, instead\r\nof the screw-thread collar _h_.\r\n\r\nThe _analyzer_[24] or upper nicol is contained in the frame _l_, which\r\nis arranged so as to slide in and out of the tube of the microscope.\r\n\r\nThe plane of vibration of the analyzer is fixed by the instrument maker\r\nso as to be at right angles to the plane of vibration of the polarizer,\r\nhence in the Seibert microscope parallel to the E. and W. cross-wire in\r\nthe eye-piece. Consequently when the frame _l_ is pushed into the tube,\r\nthe analyzer is introduced in the line of sight between the objective\r\nand the observer’s eye, with its plane of vibration at right angles to\r\nthe plane of vibration of the polarizer; that is the nicols are crossed.\r\nWhen the nicols are crossed, if they are properly adjusted, no light can\r\npass through to the eye and the field of view should be dark.[25]\r\n\r\nThe _eye-piece_[26] _o_ fits into the top of the tube, and, by means of\r\na little projecting piece fitting into a slot in the frame, can always\r\nbe adjusted so as to have its cross-wires parallel to the planes of\r\nvibration of the two nicols.[25]\r\n\r\nSome instruments are provided with an additional slot in the tube\r\nbetween the analyzer and the eye-piece for the introduction of a\r\nBertrand lens, which is used to magnify the interference figures\r\nproduced by convergent light.\r\n\r\nThe first approximate focusing is made by the screw _m_, and the fine\r\nadjustment by the screw _n_.\r\n\r\nIn focusing always start with the objective very near the section, and\r\nmove it away until the right focus is obtained. Never move down towards\r\nthe section in obtaining the focus, as there is danger then of striking\r\nthe objective against the section.\r\n\r\nFor cleaning the microscope xylol can be used, as it will not injure the\r\nlacquer. To lubricate any of the parts use a small quantity of soft\r\ntallow, good clock oil or paraffin oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n    INVESTIGATION OF MICROSCOPIC AND OPTICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n▄Characters of Opaque Minerals▄, observed by _reflected_ light.\r\n\r\nThe minerals which remain perfectly opaque in thin rock sections have\r\nusually metallic lustre and are very minute in size, as is the case with\r\nthe iron ores.\r\n\r\nWhen the metallic minerals of a rock specimen are distinctly seen with\r\nthe unaided eye, it is rarely necessary to make a section for their\r\ndetermination, as this can more easily be done by any of the well known\r\nblowpipe methods.\r\n\r\nForm, Lustre, Color, Cleavage, etc., are recognized in the same way as\r\nin the case of macroscopic specimens. In order to make the observations\r\nby reflected light alone, the beam of light from the reflector-mirror\r\nmust be cut off by holding the hand over the mirror or by moving the\r\nmirror.\r\n\r\n▄Characters of Transparent Minerals▄, observed by _transmitted_ light.\r\nThe petrographical microscope for these observations is supposed to be\r\nin the condition of an ordinary microscope, both nicols being out of the\r\nfield and a strong beam of light coming up through the transparent\r\nsection from the reflector below.\r\n\r\nThe characters are considered in the order in which they would most\r\nnaturally appear to the observer during a complete investigation with\r\nthe microscope.[27]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 4.—Idiomorphic augite crystals in camptonite.

Crystals that are large in comparison with other accompanying\r\ncrystals may be called _Phenocrysts_. Of course crystals, which are not\r\nwholly contained within the rock section, will only show the outline of\r\nthe bounding planes cut by this particular section. In some cases, by a\r\ncareful study of the outline of several sections of the same mineral and\r\nby a measurement of the angles, it is possible to determine the common\r\n“crystallographic forms” of the mineral. Very misleading outlines may,\r\nhowever, be observed; as for example the triangular outline of a section\r\nof a cube, with the corner truncated. For measuring the angles have the\r\nstage accurately centered, then bring the vertex of the angle to be\r\nmeasured to the intersection of the cross-wires in the eye-piece. Bring\r\none of the sides in coincidence with one of the cross-wires. Note the\r\nreading of the graduated circle and rotate the section until the other\r\nside is in coincidence with the same wire. Take the reading again and\r\nthe difference will be the angle required.\r\n\r\n_Crystals without bounding planes_, whose surfaces are more or less\r\ndetermined by those of adjacent crystals. Such crystals are frequently\r\ncalled _allotriomorphic_ or _xenomorphic_,[29] see Fig. 5. This\r\nallotriomorphic form must not be confounded with the worn or rounded\r\nboundaries of the component grains in clastic rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 6.—Corroded sanidine crystal in perlite.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Corroded Crystals_,[30] whose fretted outline is undoubtedly due to\r\ncorrosive action of the magma, see Fig. 6.\r\n\r\n_Broken or Strained Crystals._ In some cases what were formerly larger\r\nindividuals have been broken or shattered by dynamic action into much\r\nsmaller fragments, see Fig. 7, showing crushed rim of fragments\r\nsurrounding feldspar “auge.” In other cases an actual bending or\r\ndistortion of the crystal has taken place, and again sometimes the\r\neffect of mechanical stress is only shown by the so-called “wavy”\r\nextinction. See p. 31 and Fig. 7, showing a carlsbad twin of feldspar\r\nthat has been bent and therefore shows marked “wavy” extinction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 7.—Orthoclase “auge” (Carlsbad twin), showing bending and “wavy”\r\n    extinction, surrounded by crushed rim of mineral fragments.

Skeleton Forms _b_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Crystallites_, in general those incipient forms of crystals which have\r\nnot yet reached a stage of development sufficient to show double\r\nrefraction, see Fig. 8, _a_. Quite a number of names are used to\r\ndescribe the different forms that occur.\r\n\r\n_Microlites_, more or less completely defined microscopic crystals,\r\nwhich usually show double refraction, but cannot be always specifically\r\ndetermined, see Fig. 8, _a_.\r\n\r\n_Skeleton Forms_, resulting from rapid cooling of the magma occur in\r\nsome lavas, see Fig. 8, _b_.\r\n\r\n(_b_) ▄Color.▄ It must be remembered that the colors observed are always\r\ndue to transmitted light and may be called “_absorption tints_.”\r\nMinerals which in hand specimens are opaque are often colored in\r\nsections; and minerals which are commonly colored may appear colorless\r\nin sections. At times color may be given to a section simply by the\r\npresence of a great number of minute inclusions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 9.—Olivine crystal in basalt showing “high relief” and cleavage.\r\n]\r\n\r\n(_c_) ▄Index of Refraction.▄ _n_ = sin _i_/sin _r_. This can be\r\napproximately determined by the appearance of the surface and outline of\r\na mineral, that is by its _relief_. The descriptive terms are of course\r\nrelative, but in common practice minerals are said to have _medium_\r\nrefraction when the refractive index is between that of balsam (1.54)\r\nand that of calcite (1.60), _strong_ refraction when higher than 1.60\r\nand _weak_ refraction when lower than 1.54. In the case of uniaxial and\r\nbiaxial minerals the mean value of the indices of refraction is used.\r\n\r\nA mineral which has _strong refraction_ appears to have _high relief_,\r\n_i. e._, distinct dark contours and a rough or “shagreened” surface,[31]\r\nwhich has bright illumination and appears to stand out above the\r\nsurfaces of the surrounding minerals with weaker refraction, see Fig. 9.\r\n\r\nA mineral with _medium refraction_ does not show any _relief_, hence has\r\na smooth surface and no dark contours, see Fig. 5.\r\n\r\nA mineral with _weak refraction_ may also appear to have a rough\r\nsurface, but not so marked as in the case of a mineral with very strong\r\nrefraction, due to the smaller contrast in indices between the mineral\r\nand balsam.\r\n\r\nThe practical way of testing for the approximate index of refraction or\r\nthe _relief_ of a mineral is to make use of the lens for convergent\r\nlight, which is placed on top of the lower nicol immediately below the\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nBy lowering[32] the lens the character of the relief of a mineral\r\nsection is made very apparent.\r\n\r\nIn order to become familiar with the way in which the “relief” or\r\nappearance of the surface indicates the strength of the refractive\r\nindex, the student may use a long glass slide on which are embedded in\r\nbalsam (1.54) small fragments of different minerals, for example:\r\nSodalite (1.483), orthoclase (1.523), quartz (1.547), topaz (1.620),\r\nhornblende (1.631), augite (1.70), epidote (1.751), zircon (1.95) and\r\nrutile (2.712).\r\n\r\nDeterminations of refractive indices in sections by the methods of\r\nChaulnes,[33] Sorby,[34] or total reflection are accompanied by many\r\ndifficulties and may fail to give satisfactory results. The Becke\r\nmethod, however, often furnishes a convenient means of determining the\r\n_relative_ values of the refractive indices of adjoining minerals or of\r\nminerals embedded in balsam. This is of especial service when one of the\r\nminerals is known and hence its refractive index.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BECKE METHOD.[35]\r\n\r\nSuppose two adjoining minerals, in a thin rock section, to be singly\r\nrefracting and to have their plane of contact vertical, _i. e._,\r\nparallel to the optic axis of the microscope.\r\n\r\nLet _A_ and _C_, Fig. 10, be two such sections with the plane of contact\r\n_OO′_ vertical, _A_ having a lower refractive index than _C_, and\r\nconsider only the direction of the rays within the section, neglecting\r\nthe refractive effect of the air, glass and balsam.\r\n\r\nA beam of transmitted light contains besides normal rays convergent\r\nrays, which pass through the section as indicated in Fig. 10. Consider\r\nnow the cone of light rays _GBI_. The rays _O′G_ on meeting the plane of\r\ncontact _OO′_ will be somewhat concentrated and deflected by the higher\r\nrefractive index of _C_ and will continue as the cone _EF_. Some rays as\r\n_O′H_ will, on meeting the contact plane, be totally reflected and will\r\ncontinue as the cone _OE_, while the rest of the rays _HI_ will be\r\ndispersed and deflected by the weaker refractive index of _A_,\r\ncontinuing as the cone _OD_. Hence, more light rays will emerge on the\r\nside of the contact plane where the substance of higher refractive index\r\nlies, and there will be a concentration of illumination on this side\r\nproducing the so-called “bright line.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 10.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn practically making the test with a petrographical microscope remove\r\nthe polarizer, analyzer and condensing lens,[36] and introduce below the\r\nsection a small light-stop, to reduce in size the cone of incident\r\nlight.[37] The adapter, holding this light-stop, should be adjustable so\r\nthat the stop can be lowered sufficiently to produce the best results.\r\nThe smaller the contrast between the indices of refraction the smaller\r\nthe incident cone of light should be, as best results are obtained when\r\nthis cone is little larger than twice _O′H_, Fig. 10, all the _O′H_ rays\r\nbeing then totally reflected. The more of the _HI_ rays that pass\r\nthrough, the brighter will be the _OD_ cone and the less sharp the\r\ncontrast in illumination. A high power objective[38] should be used, as\r\nthose with small aperture and great focal length do not give good\r\nresults. Focus on the dividing plane and adjust until equal illumination\r\nis observed on both sides and the trace of the plane resembles a fine\r\nthread, the focal plane being at _MN_. Then _raise_ the _objective_\r\nslightly, thus moving the focal plane to _ST_, when a _bright line_ or\r\nband will appear on the side of the _stronger refracting_ substance, the\r\nwidth of the line depending on the contrast between _n_ and _n′_,\r\nbecoming narrower as _n_ and _n′_ approach each other in value. On\r\nraising the objective still further the line broadens and finally\r\ndisappears. If the objective is lowered instead of raised the reverse\r\nphenomenon will take place, the bright line appearing on the side of the\r\nweaker refracting substance.[39] When the indices are nearly the same a\r\nbright line will appear on both sides and it is important then to make\r\nthe cone of incident light as small as possible and to select the\r\n_brighter_ line.\r\n\r\nWith doubly refracting minerals, each set of doubly refracted rays would\r\nsuffer total reflection under somewhat different conditions and there\r\nwould be no one point _B_ (as in isotropic minerals) where no bright\r\nlines would appear. However, if the cone of incident light is small\r\nenough in diameter, the test will be practically obtained as described.\r\nThe Becke test can often be made with a medium power objective[40]\r\nwithout removing the polarizer and condensing lens, provided the\r\ncondensing lens be lowered sufficiently. It may also prove convenient to\r\nturn the reflector a little sideways.\r\n\r\nThe thinner the section the more distinct will be the phenomenon. The\r\ncontact plane must be clear and not coated with opaque decomposition\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nWhen the plane of contact _OO′_ deviates considerably from parallelism\r\nwith the optic axis of the microscope a disturbance of the phenomenon\r\nmay be expected and no satisfactory results be obtained. In general\r\nunder these conditions the “bright line,” both on raising and lowering\r\nthe objective, will remain on the side of the overlapping substance,\r\nwithout regard to the relative values of the indices.\r\n\r\nThe refractive index of the cementing material should not be very much\r\nlower than that of either of the thin sections, as the result would then\r\nbe to disperse the emerging rays too much and dim the effect. In the\r\ncase of distinguishing between minerals of high refractive power, such\r\nas augite and garnet, methyliodide is recommended instead of balsam.\r\n\r\nIn the case of doubly refracting crystals, the lower nicol (polarizer)\r\nmust be retained, if it is desired to obtain the relative refractive\r\nindex of one of the two rays, either with respect to the balsam or to a\r\nray in an adjoining crystal with a parallel vibration direction. For\r\ndetermining vibration directions of rays and the faster and slower rays\r\nin two adjoining sections see later, pp. 31 and 33.\r\n\r\nThe method of _Schrœder van der Kolk_[41] can also be employed for the\r\nsame purpose as the Becke test. The ordinary objective (Seibert No. II)\r\nis used, and the method essentially consists of darkening a portion of\r\nthe field by means of the finger or a plate inserted below the\r\npolarizer. The condenser lens must be lowered beyond the sharp focus of\r\nthe edge of the shadow (on raising the condenser the following phenomena\r\nare _reversed_). As the shadow approaches the contact between two\r\nminerals a bright line will appear on the edge of the “far” mineral, if\r\nits refractive index is the higher, and a dark line on this same edge if\r\nits index is lower than that of the “near” mineral. The indices of the\r\ntwo rays in doubly refracting minerals must be determined by the aid of\r\nthe polarizer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 11.—Biotite, showing perfect cleavage, in rhyolite.\r\n]\r\n\r\n(_d_) ▄Cleavage▄,[42] which appears as more or less distinct and regular\r\nlines or cracks, see Figs. 11 and 12. These cleavage cracks may be\r\nparallel or intersect, depending on the position of the section relative\r\nto the cleavage planes of the crystal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 12.—Augite _a_, showing good cleavage, and plagioclase _p_ in\r\n    diabase.

These inclusions are\r\ndistinguished by the fact that the solid inclusions generally have sharp\r\ncontours, the fluid inclusions distinct dark borders, and the gas\r\ninclusions broad dark borders more distinctly marked than those of the\r\nfluid inclusions. The fluid inclusions often contain a bubble of gas.\r\nThe inclusions may have a definite or indefinite position in the crystal\r\nin which they occur, and can sometimes be more distinctly seen by using\r\nconvergent light or a “spot” lens.\r\n\r\n(_g_) ▄Schiller Structure.▄ “Is that in which cavities of definite form\r\nand orientation (‘negative crystals’) are developed along certain planes\r\nand filled or partially filled by material dissolved out of the\r\nenclosing crystal,”[43] see Fig. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Characters Observed by Polarized Light.\r\n\r\nThe polarized light is obtained by passing the beam of light from the\r\nreflector through the polarizer or lower nicol,[44] which must be in\r\nplace below the stage of the microscope. White light is supposed to be\r\nused.\r\n\r\n▄Pleochroism▄, that property which all anisotropic minerals have, to a\r\ngreater or less extent, of absorbing certain colored rays in certain\r\ndirections, thereby showing different colors in different directions by\r\ntransmitted light. Uniaxial minerals are dichroic showing two\r\ndifferences in color, produced by the rays which vibrate parallel to the\r\ndirection of the vertical axis _ć_ and the plane of the basal axes.\r\nBiaxial crystals are trichroic showing theoretically three differences\r\nof color produced by rays with vibration directions corresponding very\r\nnearly to those of the three principal vibration directions.[45] Any\r\ngiven section of a biaxial crystal will, of course, appear only\r\ndichroic.\r\n\r\nThe practical way of testing for _pleochroism_ is as follows: Revolve\r\nthe stage, carrying the section, when a change in the color of the\r\nmineral will be noticed, if it is pleochroic. This pleochroism may\r\nappear as an actual change in color or simply as a change in the shade\r\nof the same color. At times it may be so weak as hardly to be noticed,\r\nwhen it is best to make the test with the condensing lens in position\r\nimmediately under the section, or by rotating the lower nicol instead of\r\nrevolving the stage. The color of the light, vibrating parallel to\r\ncertain definite crystallographic directions in minerals, is often very\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\nIn some cases there may be such strong _absorption_ of one of the rays,\r\nthat, when the vibration direction of this ray is over the plane of\r\nvibration of the polarizer, practically no light is transmitted and the\r\nsection appears dark. Strong absorption is characteristic of certain\r\nminerals, such as biotite, amphibole, tourmaline and allanite and takes\r\nplace parallel to definite directions in these minerals.\r\n\r\nPleochroism may often be noticed with ordinary light in the case of hand\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n Characters Observed with both Polarizer and Analyzer[46] in Position,\r\n                     that is with “Crossed Nicols.”\r\n\r\nWhen the nicols are accurately crossed, the field should be quite dark,\r\nand if this is not the case the adjustments must be looked to. The\r\ncondensing lens should be removed for these tests as they are to be made\r\nwith parallel light, but as a matter of convenience instead of removing\r\nthe condensing lens, the polarizer with the lens on top may be lowered,\r\nwhen the results will be about the same as with parallel light. White\r\nlight is supposed to be used.\r\n\r\n▄Isotropic Character.▄ Sections of isotropic crystals are perfectly dark\r\nand remain so during a complete rotation of the stage through 360°. The\r\nexplanation is very simple. Light being transmitted by an isotropic\r\ncrystal in all directions without double refraction; it follows that the\r\nlight from the polarizer, after having passed through the section, comes\r\nto the analyzer still vibrating in the plane of vibration of the\r\npolarizer. Hence it is entirely cut out by the analyzer.\r\n\r\n_Amorphous_ transparent substances act in the same way and remain dark\r\nduring complete rotation of the stage.\r\n\r\n_Optical anomalies_, _i. e._, double refraction, may occur in isometric\r\ncrystals and in amorphous substances that have been subjected to\r\nstrains.\r\n\r\n▄Anisotropic Character.▄ Sections of anisotropic crystals, having the\r\nproperty of _double refraction_, produce in general some _interference_\r\nor _polarization color_, except as mentioned later. The popular\r\nexplanation is as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 16.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 16, let PP′ be the plane of vibration of the polarizer, and A′A\r\nthe plane of vibration of the analyzer. All the light, after it has\r\npassed through the polarizer, is vibrating parallel to PP′ when it\r\nreaches the lower side of the transparent crystal, _cdef_, on the stage\r\nof the microscope. In this transparent section let _ob_ and _oa_ be the\r\ntwo _directions_ of _vibration_, _i. e._, the only two directions\r\nparallel to which rays of light can vibrate in passing through the\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nLet _om_ represent the amplitude of vibration of a ray from the\r\npolarizer. When this ray reaches the section it cannot get through it\r\nvibrating in the direction _om_, but is doubly refracted and of the two\r\nresulting rays, one gets through vibrating in the direction _ob_ and the\r\nother vibrating in the direction _oa_. From _m_ draw perpendiculars to\r\n_ob_ and _oa_. Then according to the law of the parallelogram of forces\r\n_ob_ will represent the amplitude of vibration of the ray passing\r\nthrough the crystal vibrating in the direction _ob_, and _oa_ will\r\nrepresent the amplitude of vibration of the ray passing through the\r\ncrystal vibrating in the direction _oa_. We will thus have two rays\r\npassing through the crystal, polarized at right angles to each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 17.\r\n]\r\n\r\nConsider now the general question of the transmission of the doubly\r\nrefracted rays through a plate. Whatever the angle of the parallel\r\nincident rays, each ray as AB, Fig. 17, is resolved, as just described,\r\ninto two rays BC and BD, polarized at right angles to each other and\r\nfollowing (usually) different paths in the plate. On emergence these\r\nfollow parallel paths. Among the incident rays there are rays EG and FH,\r\nsuch that one component of FH will emerge at D with one of the\r\ncomponents of AB, and one component of AB and one component of EG will\r\nemerge at C. Hence from every point of the upper surface of the plate\r\nthere will emerge two rays and these rays will have travelled through\r\ndifferent paths in the plate with different velocities and will have\r\ntheir vibrations at right angles to each other.\r\n\r\nWhen these doubly refracted rays come to the analyzer, whose plane of\r\nvibration is A′A, they cannot get through vibrating in their present\r\ndirections, but components of these rays, such as _ot_ and _os_, can get\r\nthrough vibrating parallel to the plane A′A.\r\n\r\nHence we have two series of rays coming to the eye, polarized in the\r\nsame plane, but one set slightly in advance of the other. These rays\r\nwill “interfere” and produce some _interference_ or _polarization_\r\ncolor.[47] In using white light whenever one of two light rays of the\r\nsame color has suffered a “retardation” of just one wave-length (or even\r\nmultiple thereof) the color will be extinguished; and when the\r\n“retardation” is one half wave-length (or even multiple thereof) the\r\ncolor will be intensified. Therefore, some tints will be extinguished\r\nand others intensified, the combination resulting in the production of\r\nsome definite interference color. Of course in the case of monochromatic\r\nlight the thickness of the section may be such that “destructive\r\ninterference” takes place producing no color (darkness).\r\n\r\nNow suppose the stage to be rotated until the section _cdef_ takes the\r\nposition _c′d′e′f′_. The section will be found to be dark and no\r\ninterference color will be seen. This is due to the fact that the\r\ndirections of vibration in the section are parallel to the planes of\r\nvibration of the crossed nicols, consequently the light passes through\r\nthe section still vibrating parallel to the plane PP′ of the polarizer\r\nand is all cut out by the analyzer. Darkness will occur every 90° and\r\ntherefore four times during a complete rotation of the stage. The\r\ninterference color is also observed to vary in intensity, but not in\r\ncolor, and to be at its maximum 45° from the positions of darkness.\r\n\r\nSections of uniaxial crystals at right angles to the optic axis act like\r\nisotropic substances and remain dark during a complete rotation of the\r\nstage. In the biaxial crystals, a section at right angles to an “optic\r\naxis” shows uniform illumination[48] which does not change as the stage\r\nis rotated.\r\n\r\nThe only way to find out whether sections that remain dark are\r\nisotropic, or uniaxial at right angles to an optic axis, is to test them\r\nwith convergent light as described later, see p. 40.\r\n\r\n▄Interference Colors.▄ The interference color shown by any mineral\r\nsection depends on three factors: 1° the strength of the double\r\nrefraction (_γ_ − _α_ = the difference between the refractive indices of\r\nthe slowest and fastest rays); 2° the position of the section in the\r\ncrystal; 3° the thickness of the crystal section.\r\n\r\nTo eliminate, so far as possible, the variation due to the optical\r\norientation of the section, care must always be taken to obtain the\r\nmaximum interference color given by the different sections of the same\r\nmineral in the rock section. Sections giving the maximum color are those\r\nparallel to the _ć_ axis in uniaxial minerals and those parallel to the\r\naxial plane in biaxial minerals.[49] Hence such sections in convergent\r\nlight never show the emergence of an optic axis or a bisectrix; and\r\nfurthermore, other clues, such as crystal outlines, cleavage,\r\npleochroism, etc., may help to indicate the favorable section.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the thickness of the section is also important and must\r\nbe considered. The interference color will rise in the scale (be higher\r\nin order) as the section becomes thicker. Methods of obtaining the\r\nthickness of a section are given on pp. 35 and 36. When reference is\r\nmade to definite interference colors the mineral section is supposed to\r\nhave a thickness of 0.03 mm. and to be such as to give the maximum\r\ncolor; and all mineral sections in a rock section are considered to have\r\na uniform thickness.\r\n\r\nWith these precautions in mind the _interference colors_ indicate the\r\n_strength_ of the _double refraction_ as follows:[50] The colors of\r\nminerals with very weak double refraction vary from a bluish-gray to a\r\ngrayish-white. As the strength of the double refraction increases the\r\ncolors become the very intense bright tints of the spectrum, yellow,\r\nred, blue, green, etc., called the first and second order colors. As the\r\nstrength of the double refraction still increases the colors pass\r\nthrough the tints of the spectrum in sequence (called orders), becoming\r\npaler until finally, when the double refraction is very strong, the\r\ncolors become the neutral, almost colorless tints of the higher orders.\r\nThe eye must be trained to appreciate the colors of different orders,\r\nand the student is advised to practice with mineral sections, of known\r\nstrength of double refraction, and compare the resulting interference\r\ncolors with a color chart,[51] or use the interference color diagram at\r\nthe end of the book. A convenient test can be made with a one fourth\r\nundulation mica plate to distinguish between the white of the 1° order\r\nand the practically white very high order tint. Introduce the mica plate\r\nin the slot _k_, Fig. 2, and the effect will be to produce a marked\r\nchange in the color of the 1° order, while no change will be observed in\r\nthe high order color.\r\n\r\nThe exact order of the color can be determined by the use of a quartz\r\nwedge, as described on p. 35.\r\n\r\n_Abnormal Interference Colors_[52] may be brought about in several ways.\r\nIn white light strong absorption of part of the light components may not\r\nonly alter the color of the mineral but also modify the interference\r\ncolor. The double refraction may be nearly zero for light of a\r\nparticular color so that the mineral is isotropic for that color,\r\nresulting in a change in the interference color, as for example the\r\nindigo of melilite, which is nearly isotropic for yellow light. In\r\nbiaxial minerals the axial angle may be zero for light of a particular\r\ncolor, resulting also in a modification of the interference color, as\r\nthe blue in penninite in sections ⟂ _Bx_{a}_. When the bisectrices are\r\nmuch dispersed there will be no position of darkness between crossed\r\nnicols in white light.\r\n\r\n▄Extinction and Extinction Angles.▄ When the section, see Fig. 16, is in\r\nsuch a position that its directions of vibration are parallel to the\r\nplanes of vibration of the nicols, no light can pass through the\r\nanalyzer, and the section is dark. Hence the light is extinguished and\r\nthis phenomenon is called _extinction_.\r\n\r\n_Extinction_ is said to be _parallel_ or _symmetrical_ when the\r\ndirections of vibration are parallel to any crystallographic lines or\r\ndirections, or bisect the angles between these lines. The\r\ncrystallographic lines or directions may be either cleavages or the\r\nsimilar boundaries of idiomorphic crystals.\r\n\r\nThis kind of _extinction_ is shown by all sections of tetragonal and\r\nhexagonal crystals, by all sections parallel to the crystal axes in\r\northorhombic crystals and also by the sections parallel to the ƃ axis in\r\nmonoclinic crystals.\r\n\r\nWhen the _extinction_ is not symmetrical it is called _oblique_, and is\r\nshown by all sections of monoclinic crystals (except those parallel to\r\nthe ƃ axis) and triclinic crystals.\r\n\r\nExtinction which does not take place over the whole of the section of a\r\nsingle crystal at the same moment, but passes over the section like a\r\ndark wave or shadow, is said to be “_wavy_”; and indicates that the\r\ncrystal has been subjected to mechanical forces producing a change in\r\nthe position of the directions of vibration in different parts of the\r\ncrystal, see Fig. 7.\r\n\r\nThe angle between a direction of vibration in the section and some known\r\ncrystallographic direction (as a cleavage or crystal outline) is called\r\nan _extinction angle_, and is measured in the following way: Find the\r\npositions of the directions of vibration in the section, which must be\r\nparallel to the cross-wires when extinction takes place. Note the\r\nreading on the graduated circle of the stage, then remove the upper\r\nnicol, in order to get a more distinct view of the field, and rotate the\r\nstage until you bring some known crystallographic line into parallel\r\nposition with the cross-wire selected as a reference line. Take the\r\nreading of the graduated circle again, and the difference between these\r\ntwo readings will be the _extinction angle_.\r\n\r\nIt can readily be seen that depending on which way the section is\r\nrotated, either a small or a large extinction angle will be obtained,\r\nthe two angles being complements of each other. The extinction angle\r\ngenerally recorded is that between the nearest direction of vibration\r\nand the vertical axis _ć_.\r\n\r\nIn monoclinic minerals the maximum value of the extinction angle (the\r\nangle of real value in distinguishing the mineral) can only be obtained\r\nfrom a section parallel to the clino pinacoid (010); but in practice\r\nsufficiently accurate results can generally be obtained by measuring the\r\nextinction angles of all sections of the same mineral, which seem to be\r\nabout parallel to the vertical axis _ć_, and then taking the maximum\r\nvalue obtained. Amphibole and pyroxene can easily be distinguished in\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\n_Extinction_ is generally tested for by revolving the stage, carrying\r\nthe section, until darkness is observed. The principal difficulty,\r\nhowever, is caused by the eye failing to appreciate the position of\r\nmaximum darkness. Hence it is better to revolve the stage until the\r\nsection just becomes dark (or fades out) and then revolve further until\r\nthe section just begins to lighten up again. The mean of the readings,\r\nin these two positions, will be the one to use.\r\n\r\nA gypsum test-plate, so prepared as to give some definite interference\r\ncolor, as red of the 1° order, may be introduced between the two nicols,\r\nand the section revolved until this color is exactly matched. This\r\nperfect matching of color is only possible when the directions of\r\nvibration of the section are exactly parallel to the planes of vibration\r\nof the nicols, as otherwise some interference color would be produced by\r\nthe section and the true color of the test-plate would not appear. The\r\nmost favorable condition is when the section is colorless and only\r\ncovers a part of the field of view, as then the rest of the field shows\r\nthe color of the test-plate and the exact matching of color is an easy\r\nmatter. This method of testing can be employed to recognize the very\r\nweak double refraction of some minerals, whose interference colors are\r\nsuch dark grays as not to be noticed without this test. After the\r\ntest-plate has been introduced, some slight variation in the color will\r\nbe observed when the stage carrying the doubly refracting section is\r\nrotated. There are other methods[53] for locating these directions of\r\nvibration. They depend generally on substituting changes of color for\r\ndegrees of darkness or on changes in interference figures, and consist\r\nin the use of color test-plates or Klein’s quartz-plate, or of special\r\noculars prepared by Bertrand, Calderon, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF TESTING FOR THE VIBRATION DIRECTIONS OF THE FASTER AND SLOWER\r\n               RAYS, _A′_ AND _C′_, IN A MINERAL SECTION.\r\n\r\nA mica or gypsum plate can be used to make this test, the directions of\r\nvibration of the faster and slower rays on these plates being known and\r\nmarked.[54]\r\n\r\nThe crystal section to be tested is placed on the rotating stage,\r\nbetween crossed nicols, and turned to the position of extinction, when\r\nthese directions of vibration will be parallel to the cross-wires in the\r\neye-piece. The section is then turned 45°, when the interference color\r\nwill be at its maximum, and these directions of vibration will make\r\nangles of 45° with the planes of vibration of the nicols and the\r\ncross-wires in the eye-piece.\r\n\r\nNow introduce[55] the test-plate, between the section and the analyzer,\r\nso that its known directions of vibration also make angles of 45° with\r\nthe cross-wires in the eye-piece.\r\n\r\nWhen the test-plate is introduced a new interference color will be\r\nnoticed which is either higher or lower in the color scale[56] than the\r\noriginal interference color of the mineral section. When the known\r\ndirections of vibration of the test-plate are superposed over\r\ncorresponding directions in the mineral section, the effect is to\r\nthicken the section and the interference color rises in the scale.\r\n\r\nWhen the directions of vibration of the test-plate are superposed over\r\ndirections of vibration in the mineral section which are not\r\ncorresponding, the effect is to thin the section and the interference\r\ncolor sinks in the scale.\r\n\r\nFor minerals which have very strong double refraction, as zircons, so\r\nthat the interference colors are of the higher orders, it is advisable\r\nto use the method of testing with a quartz wedge.[57]\r\n\r\nIf a wedge is inserted between crossed nicols and its _c_ direction\r\ninclined at 45° to the planes of vibration of the nicols, then\r\nsuccessive interference colors will be seen commencing with the gray of\r\nthe first order and passing through the colors as shown by a color\r\nchart. If now the crystal section lies with its vibration directions\r\nalso in the diagonal position, the color of any portion of the quartz\r\nwedge will be changed where it covers the section, the new color being\r\nthat of a thicker part of the wedge if the _c_ direction in the section\r\nlies under the _c_ direction of the wedge. Also where the wedge overlaps\r\nthe section the displacement of the color fringes in the section will be\r\ntowards the thin edge of the wedge. On the other hand the new color will\r\nbe that of a thinner part of the wedge when the _a_ direction in the\r\nsection lies under the _c_ direction of the wedge. In this case the\r\ndisplacement of the color fringes will be towards the thick part of the\r\nwedge.\r\n\r\nThis method is very convenient when the crystal section has in any place\r\nsloping edges, showing prismatic color fringes. The movement of these\r\nfringes (as previously described) is towards the thin edge of the wedge\r\nwhen the vibration directions correspond and away from this edge when\r\nthey do not correspond.\r\n\r\nIf the wedge when inserted finally “compensates” the color of the\r\ncrystal section (_i. e._, practically produces an absence of color,\r\ndarkness), then the a in this section must lie under the c in the wedge,\r\nas the effect of the wedge has been to continually thin the section.\r\n\r\n\r\n             DETERMINATION OF ORDER OF INTERFERENCE COLOR.\r\n\r\nThis can be determined by use of a quartz wedge or a v. Federow mica\r\nwedge.[58] Have the vibration directions of the given section in the\r\ndiagonal position, then gradually insert the wedge between the crossed\r\nnicols so that the corresponding vibration directions in the section and\r\nwedge are crossed, that is so that the colors are run down until finally\r\ndark gray or black is obtained. Count the number of times the original\r\ninterference color reappears, if _n_ times, then the color is a red,\r\nblue, green, etc., of _n_ + 1 order.[59]\r\n\r\nIt is often easier to insert the wedge until compensation of the color\r\nis obtained; then as the wedge is pulled out the direct count of the\r\nrecurrence of the original color will give the order of that color.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF MEASURING THE STRENGTH OF THE DOUBLE REFRACTION BY VON FEDEROW\r\n                            MICA WEDGE.[60]\r\n\r\n“The wedge[61] consists of fifteen superposed quarter undulation mica\r\nplates, each about two mm. shorter than the one beneath it and with\r\ntheir directions of vibration parallel. The series is mounted on a strip\r\nof glass and covered with a cover-glass.\r\n\r\nThe wave-length of a middle color may be taken as 560 μμ (millionths of\r\na millimeter); hence each quarter undulation mica plate may be\r\nconsidered to possess a phase difference or retardation of 140 μμ. If,\r\nthen, between the polarizer and analyzer we insert the mica wedge, so\r\nthat its direction of vibration of the slower ray, _c_, is at right\r\nangles to that of the mineral under examination, we subtract from the\r\nphase difference of the mineral an amount equal to _n_ times 140 μμ, in\r\nwhich _n_ represents the number of superposed mica plates in the field.\r\nWhen the mineral appears dark the value evidently corresponds closely to\r\nthe phase difference of the mineral.[62]\r\n\r\nFrom the expression Δ = _eX_, in which Δ is the phase difference or\r\nretardation, _X_ the double refraction, and _e_ the thickness in\r\nmillionths of millimeters, the thickness can be deduced when the double\r\nrefraction is known or _vice versa_. If a mineral of known double\r\nrefraction can be found in the section near the mineral under\r\ninvestigation,[63] the double refraction of the latter can be deduced by\r\nmeasuring the phase difference of the known mineral, whence e results,\r\nand this substituted in the above formula yields _X_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF DETERMINING MINERALS AND THICKNESS OF SECTION, BY USE OF TABLE\r\n            OF DOUBLE REFRACTION (MAXIMUM) AND DIAGRAM.[64]\r\n\r\nSelect some easily recognized mineral in the rock section and note the\r\nmaximum interference color given by any of its sections.[65] The\r\nstrength of the double refraction of this mineral being known, look up\r\non the diagram the diagonal line corresponding to this double refraction\r\nand follow along this line toward the left hand lower corner until the\r\nobserved interference color is reached, when the horizontal line will\r\nindicate the thickness of the section. The thickness is given in\r\nhundredths of millimeters. Then in the case of the unknown mineral pick\r\nout the section giving the highest interference color and carry along\r\nthe same horizontal line until this new color is located,[66] then pass\r\nup to the right along the diagonal line to the numbers indicating the\r\nstrength of the double refraction of the unknown mineral. Turn to the\r\ntable where the minerals will be found having about this strength of\r\ndouble refraction.\r\n\r\n_Example:_ In a section of granite (biotite-granite) a grain of quartz\r\nwas selected, which gave the brightest color. This color was a bright\r\nyellowish white and the known double refraction of quartz is 0.009.\r\nFollowing down on this diagonal line until the interference color was\r\nreached it was seen that the thickness of the section was about 0.03 mm.\r\n(a very thin section). The section of the undetermined mineral, giving\r\nthe highest order color, showed a bright 2° order purple-blue. Passing\r\nalong the 0.03 horizontal line until this color was reached and then up\r\nalong the diagonal line, it was seen that the double refraction of this\r\nmineral must be about 0.04. The table gives muscovite and ægerite as\r\nhaving about this double refraction. The mineral was proved to be\r\nmuscovite by its absence of color and relief and by the characteristic\r\ncleavage and parallel extinction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 18.—Sanidine crystal _f_, showing Carlsbad twin (which, as it\r\n    consists of two parts only, may be called _simple_), and quartz _q_\r\n    in rhyolite.

It may also be observed, without crossed\r\nnicols, just as in the case of macroscopic minerals.\r\n\r\nTwinning may be described as: _simple_, Fig. 18; _polysynthetic_, due to\r\nrepeated twinning after the same law, Fig. 12; and _crossed or\r\n“gridiron,”_ due to repeated twinning after two laws, Fig. 19.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 19.—Microcline, showing crossed or “gridiron” twinning.

It may, however, be noticed by the\r\nzones being of slightly different color, or by the zonal distribution of\r\ninclusions. In the case of the feldspars the zonal structure may be\r\ncaused either by the crystal being formed of zones of different chemical\r\ncomposition (the successive zones in the plagioclases growing more acid\r\ntowards the exterior), or by ultra-microscopic twinning,[67] Fig. 20.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 20.—Zonal feldspar (Carlsbad twin) in trachyte.

When the stage is revolved the arms of the\r\ncross do not rotate, Fig. 21.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 22.—Olivine decomposed to serpentine.

By means of a suitable adjustment the\r\ncondensing lens can be brought very close to the lower surface of the\r\nsection on the stage. The lens thus sends a cone of light through the\r\nsection, and used in connection with _crossed nicols_ a series of\r\noptical phenomena, called _interference figures_,[68] are produced.\r\n\r\nEach direction in which rays are sent is traversed by a minute bundle of\r\nparallel rays and these rays extinguish and produce interference colors\r\nas already described for parallel light. Hence each direction yields a\r\nspot or picture in the field of view and from all these spots combined\r\nthere results an “interference figure” or picture, depending upon the\r\nstructure of the section for all the directions traversed by the rays.\r\n\r\nA very high power objective[69] must be used, and when the eye-piece is\r\nremoved, a small image of the interference figure will be seen. In some\r\nmicroscopes an arrangement is made for getting a magnified image of the\r\ninterference figure, by retaining the eye-piece and using an additional\r\nBertrand lens.\r\n\r\nIn order to get good results care must be taken to have strong\r\nillumination and the condensing lens close up under the section. The\r\ntests are best made with monochromatic light, but with white light the\r\neffects are substantially the same, the only difference being that the\r\nrings and curves are variously colored instead of being simply light and\r\ndark.\r\n\r\n_Isotropic_ substances show no _interference figures_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Uniaxial Interference Figures.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Sections perpendicular to the optic or vertical axis _ć_ show a\r\ndark cross, with or without colored rings, Figs. 23 and 24. The figure\r\nis symmetrical to the center, as the optical behavior of uniaxial\r\ncrystals is symmetrical to the optic axis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 23.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 24.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe arms of the cross are parallel to the planes of vibration of the\r\nnicols, and the figure does not move when the stage carrying the section\r\nis rotated.[70]\r\n\r\n(_b_) Sections oblique to the optic axis show a portion of a dark cross,\r\nwith or without colored rings, Fig. 25. The centre of the cross is not\r\nin the axis of rotation, and as the stage bearing the section is\r\nrevolved, the centre of the cross describes a circle, the arms always\r\nmaintaining parallel positions.\r\n\r\nIf the section is still more oblique to the optic axis the centre of the\r\ninterference cross may be outside the field of view, and only portions\r\nof the dark arms will be seen.\r\n\r\nSections parallel to the optic axis show a vague dark cross, which, on\r\nrotating the stage, dissolves into hyperbolic curves (suggesting biaxial\r\nfigure), which very rapidly disappear in the direction of the optic\r\naxis. When the interference figure shows colors, these colors are lower\r\nin order in the quadrants containing the optic axis. Knowing thus the\r\nposition of the optic axis the optical character can be obtained by the\r\nmethod for parallel light, p. 43.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 25.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSections which are thick and have strong double refraction will show the\r\ncross and rings clearly and sharply defined, there being quite a number\r\nof rings crowded close together. Sections which are very thin and have\r\nweak double refraction show only a broad dark cross and no rings. The\r\ninterference figures will vary between these extremes, depending on the\r\nthickness of the section and the strength of the double refraction.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the most characteristic figures, observations must be made on\r\nsections about perpendicular to the optic axis, that is sections which\r\nremain dark or nearly dark during complete rotation between crossed\r\nnicols in parallel light.\r\n\r\n▄Optical Character, Positive or Negative.▄ After having obtained an\r\nuniaxial interference figure, test it by means of a ¼ undulation mica\r\nplate. This plate must be introduced between the objective[71] and the\r\nanalyzer in such a way that its vibration direction c, marked on the\r\nplate, makes an angle of 45° with the planes of vibration of the nicols.\r\n\r\nWhen this is done the interference figure changes, or may more or less\r\ndisappear, two dark spots or blotches being brought prominently into\r\nview. If rings are still seen it will be noticed that they have expanded\r\nin the quadrants occupied by the dark spots, and have contracted in the\r\nremaining quadrants. This movement of the rings may make it possible to\r\ndetermine the optical character of a section, which is so oblique to the\r\noptic axis that the dark spots are not seen after the introduction of\r\nthe mica plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 26.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 27.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf the optical character is _positive_ the line joining these dark spots\r\nis perpendicular to the direction c of the mica plate, see Fig. 26.\r\n\r\nIf _negative_ the line joining the dark spots coincides with the\r\ndirection c of the mica plate, see Fig. 27.\r\n\r\nThe (+) and (−) character is easily determined by remembering that the\r\nline, joining the dark spots, makes the + and − sign respectively with\r\nthe direction c of the mica plate. The direction c of the mica plate\r\n(represented in the figures by an arrow) is of course not seen, but its\r\nposition must be borne in mind when making this test. This test can be\r\nmade with either monochromatic or white light.\r\n\r\nIf the mica plate does not give satisfactory results, which will be the\r\ncase when the double refraction of the crystal to be tested is very weak\r\nor when the section is very thin, use a selenite plate, cut the proper\r\nthickness to give the red color of the first order.\r\n\r\nThis plate must be introduced with its vibration direction a (previously\r\ndetermined) making an angle of 45° with the planes of vibration of the\r\nnicols. Instead of the dark spots being seen there will appear two blue\r\nand two red quadrants. The diagonally opposite quadrants being of the\r\nsame color.\r\n\r\nIn determining the (+) and (−) character consider the blue quadrants as\r\nthe equivalent of the dark spots in the preceding case. This test must\r\nbe made with white light.[72]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Biaxial Interference Figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 28.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 29.\r\n]\r\n\r\n(_a_) Sections perpendicular to an optic axis exhibit the interference\r\nfigures shown in Figs. 28 and 29, the curves being nearly circular and a\r\nstraight black bar bisecting these curves, whenever the trace of the\r\nplane of the optic axes coincides with the vibration direction of either\r\nnicol. As the stage, carrying the section, is rotated the bar changes\r\ninto one arm of a hyperbola and back again into a bar. This arm or bar\r\nwill rotate in the opposite direction to the motion of the stage.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated sections of biaxial crystals, perpendicular to an\r\noptic axis, do not remain dark during rotation of the stage between\r\ncrossed nicols in parallel light. On the contrary these sections remain\r\nuniformly illuminated.[73]\r\n\r\n(_b_) Sections perpendicular to the acute bisectrix (see p. 5), exhibit\r\ninterference figures like those shown in Figs. 30 and 31.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 30.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 31.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFig. 30 shows the appearance of the interference figure when the plane\r\nof the optic axes is parallel to the plane of vibration of either nicol,\r\nand Fig. 31 shows the appearance when this plane is inclined 45° to the\r\nplanes of vibration of the nicols.\r\n\r\nAs the stage, carrying the section, is rotated the dark cross seems to\r\ndissolve into two branches of a hyperbola, which again unite to form a\r\ncross.\r\n\r\nIn sections perpendicular to a bisectrix, with a large axial angle, the\r\nfigure will appear, during a rotation of 90° (in the direction of the\r\nhands of a watch), as in Fig. 32, top row. When the section is somewhat\r\noblique to an “optic axis,” the figure appears as in middle row; and\r\nwhen still more oblique, as in bottom row.\r\n\r\nThe black centres[74] of the small ellipses and the black hyperbolic\r\ncurves mark the points of emergence of the optic axes, and therefore\r\nindicate approximately the size of the _axial angle_, 2_E_.\r\n\r\nSections in other positions, relative to the optic axes, give\r\ninterference figures less definite in appearance than those just\r\ndescribed; and the same conditions affect the appearance of all figures\r\nas in the case of uniaxial crystals. Very thin sections, of weak double\r\nrefraction, may only show indistinct dark crosses or hyperbolic curves,\r\nwithout any ellipses.\r\n\r\nThe section perpendicular to the acute bisectrix, which gives the most\r\ncharacteristic interference figure, cannot generally be recognized\r\nexcept by an examination in convergent light. It is never, however, the\r\nsection giving the maximum interference color. The interference colors\r\nin different sections, normal to the optical elements, grade downward in\r\nthe following order: (1) optic normal, (2) obtuse bisectrix, (3) acute\r\nbisectrix, (4) optic axis. Sometimes cleavage may furnish a clue as to\r\nthe best section to test as in Topaz and Mica, where the acute bisectrix\r\nis normal to the cleavage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 32.—Biaxial Interference Figures (from Reinisch). Top row: Almost\r\n    perpendicular to bisectrix, large axial angle. Middle row: Somewhat\r\n    oblique to an “optic axis.” Bottom row: More oblique to an “optic\r\n    axis.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that this uncertainty, in the choice of sections\r\nfor testing, does not exist in uniaxial crystals; where the best\r\nsections are indicated by the fact that they remain dark or nearly so\r\nduring complete rotation between crossed nicols.\r\n\r\nThe uniaxial or biaxial character of a mineral section, which only shows\r\nan indistinct bar, may be determined as follows: A bar (one arm of the\r\ncross) of a uniaxial interference figure moves in the same direction as\r\nthe rotating stage, and always remains straight, while the biaxial bar\r\nrotates in the opposite direction to the stage and becomes curved.\r\n\r\n▄Optical Character, Positive or Negative.▄ When the axial angle is very\r\nsmall, so that the interference figure approaches that of a uniaxial\r\ncrystal, the methods used for testing uniaxial figures are employed.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the axial angle is large, the following method can be\r\nused:\r\n\r\nAfter having obtained an interference figure, from a section as nearly\r\nat right angles to the acute bisectrix[75] as possible, the stage is\r\nrotated until the plane of the optic axes (the trace of which on the\r\nplane of the section is the line joining the points of emergence of the\r\ntwo optic axes) makes an angle of 45° with the planes of vibration of\r\nthe crossed nicols or the cross-wires in the eye-piece.\r\n\r\nA quartz wedge[76] is now pushed in between the mineral section and the\r\nanalyzer,[77] so that its axis _ć_ = c (previously determined and marked\r\non the wedge) is either at right angles or parallel to the plane of the\r\noptic axes of the mineral section.\r\n\r\nThe optical character of the mineral is _positive_ when the ellipses,\r\nsurrounding the points of emergence of the two optic axes on the convex\r\nsides of the hyperbola, appear to expand or open out towards the centre\r\nwhen the quartz wedge is pushed in with its axis parallel to the plane\r\nof the optic axes.\r\n\r\nThe optical character is _negative_ when the ellipses appear to expand\r\nor open out when the wedge is pushed in with its axis at right angles to\r\nthe plane of the optic axes.\r\n\r\nAs the ellipses expand they move from the points of emergence of the\r\noptic axes towards the centre of the interference figure, and finally\r\nopen into lemniscates which move outward from the plane of the optic\r\naxes.\r\n\r\nEven when the section is very thin and the double refraction very weak,\r\nonly the black hyperbolas without ellipses being seen, the test can be\r\nmade; and colored ellipses will appear, after the pushing in of the\r\nquartz wedge, which will act in the same way as the ellipses of the\r\ninterference figure.\r\n\r\nIn a section at right angles to the _obtuse bisectric_ these results are\r\nall reversed.\r\n\r\nWhen the section is perpendicular to one optic axis, rotate the section\r\nuntil the plane of its optic axes is 45° to the planes of vibration of\r\nthe nicols. The interference figure will now have the appearance as\r\nshown in Fig. 29, the hyperbola being convex towards the acute\r\nbisectrix. Insert the ¼ undulation mica plate, so that its direction c\r\nis parallel to the plane of the optic axes. If the optical character is\r\npositive the hyperbola will move towards the acute bisectrix and if\r\nnegative away from it. When the gypsum plate is used the blue color will\r\nappear on the convex side for (+) and on the concave side for (−)\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\n▄Determination of the Axial Angle.▄[78] This can be approximately\r\ndetermined with a petrographical microscope, if equipped with a\r\nmicrometer eye-piece. Have the axial plane of the crystal section in the\r\ndiagonal position, Fig. 31; and measure the distance _d_ from the centre\r\nto either hyperbola with a micrometer (or average the distance to both).\r\nThen sin _E = d/C_, in which _C_ is a constant for the same combination\r\nof lenses and is obtained by using a crystal section (mica cleavage) of\r\nknown axial angle. For example, in a mica with 2_E_ = 91° 50′ and _d_ =\r\n41.5 divisions on the micrometer scale, _C = d_/sin _E_ = 57.78 for that\r\nspecial combination of lenses. The true axial angle can be obtained from\r\nthe equation sin _V = d/βC_.\r\n\r\n▄Optical Distinctions between Orthorhombic, Monoclinic, and Triclinic\r\nCrystal Sections (perpendicular to acute and obtuse bisectrices).▄ The\r\ninterference figures are always symmetrical in shape and distribution of\r\ncolor to the planes and axes of symmetry of the crystal system; hence\r\nare most symmetrical in the orthorhombic, less so in the monoclinic and\r\nstill less so in the triclinic system.\r\n\r\n_Orthorhombic crystals_ show the figures always in two of the pinacoids\r\nand in white light the color distribution will be symmetrical to the\r\ntrace of the axial plane and the line through the centre at right angles\r\nto this trace and also to the central point.\r\n\r\n_Monoclinic crystals_ show the figures in the clino pinacoid or in\r\nsections at right angles to this. In white light the color distribution\r\nis never symmetrical to two lines, but is symmetrical either to the\r\ntrace of the axial plane (_inclined dispersion_[79]), or to the line\r\nthrough the centre at right angles to this trace (_horizontal\r\ndispersion_), or to the central point (_crossed dispersion_).\r\n\r\n_Triclinic crystals_ show in white light figures with distribution of\r\ncolor unsymmetrical to any line or point.\r\n\r\nIn white light the “color fringes” of the hyperbola are due to the\r\n“_dispersion_”[79] of the optic axes and bisectrices. That is, for each\r\ncolor (for light of each wave-length) there is a particular interference\r\nfigure; the overlapping of these superposed figures producing the color\r\nfringes.\r\n\r\nWhen the axial angle is larger for red light than for violet, the\r\ndispersion is said to be ρ > ν and the interference figure, in the\r\nposition of Fig. 31, will show the hyperbolic curves fringed with red\r\ntowards the centre (inside). In general the color with the larger axial\r\nangle is nearer the centre of the field. This is due to the\r\nextinguishing of light of each color at the axial points, the resulting\r\ncolors at these points being produced by white light minus the absorbed\r\ncolor. When the dispersion is ν > ρ the reverse distribution of color\r\nfringes will take place.\r\n\r\nBy measuring the axial angle in red and blue light, this dispersion of\r\nthe optic axes can also be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n     RESUMÉ OF THE USES OF PARALLEL AND CONVERGENT POLARIZED LIGHT.\r\n\r\n_Parallel_ light is used to detect pleochroism, to distinguish between\r\nisotropic and anisotropic substances, to study interference colors, to\r\ndetermine the strength of the double refraction, to locate directions of\r\nvibration, to measure extinction angles, to find the directions of\r\nvibration of the faster and slower rays, to determine the relative value\r\nof the indices of refraction of the two rays, and to investigate the\r\ncrystal structure in general.\r\n\r\n_Convergent_ light is used to distinguish between uniaxial and biaxial\r\ncrystals, to determine whether a section that appears to be isotropic is\r\nreally so or only perpendicular to an optic axis and to determine the\r\noptical character, grade of symmetry (system), axial angle and\r\ndispersion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n          THE MICROSCOPIC AND OPTICAL CHARACTERS OF MINERALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 OPAL.\r\n\r\n            ISOTROPIC.

The mica-like form is limited to the porphyritic\r\n  eruptives. The brown pigment in the plagioclase of certain gabbros may\r\n  be ilmenite. It is attacked slowly by hot hydrochloric acid, and the\r\n  solution when heated with tin becomes violet.

More or less\r\nchemically corroded pyramidal crystals (with cross-sections six-sided or\r\nrhombic with an angle of about 100°) in the porphyritic rocks. Rounded\r\nor angular grains in the “clastic” rocks; granular mosaic in crystalline\r\nschists and contact rocks, very rarely in distinct crystals in any\r\nrocks. May at times be mutually interpenetrated with an acid feldspar\r\n(the areas of quartz and feldspar extinguishing as entire crystals),\r\nproducing “micro-pegmatitic” structure, Fig. 67.

The inclusions are not so abundant in porphyritic\r\nrocks, but a few glass inclusions may occur, filling up “negative”\r\ncrystals in the quartz.

It is also a characteristic mineral of all acidic rocks,\r\n  being common in granite, aplite, rhyolite, quartz-porphyry,\r\n  quartz-diorite, dacite, etc. Quartz is very brittle and hence is a\r\n  good indicator of the dynamic forces which have affected the rocks. It\r\n  may show traces of mechanical deformation by peripheral shattering of\r\n  the larger grains or by “wavy extinction”;[85] and also evidences of\r\n  chemical corrosion by curved and looped contours. In some diabases the\r\n  quartz may be surrounded by a rim of hornblende or augite needles\r\n  (“quartz augen”). “Cataclastic” quartz may be biaxial. The “secondary\r\n  enlargement” of quartz in clastic rocks may be noticed by the\r\n  deposition of silica in crystallographic orientation around the\r\n  clastic grains,[86] the new portion extinguishing at the same time as\r\n  the core. Quartz is not attacked by ordinary acids. H., 7. Sp. gr.,\r\n  2.6 to 2.7.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chalcedony._—This variety of SiO_{2} has a radially fibrous structure\r\nand shelly parting. It may form sphærulites, central sections through\r\nwhich show a dark cross between crossed nicols, or line cavities in\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nThe index of refraction is a little lower than for ordinary quartz. The\r\noptical character is (−), which must be determined by a mica or gypsum\r\nplate, _ć_ = a. Elongation ∥ a′.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chalcedony occurs in the ground mass of very silicious porphyritic\r\n  rocks, which have microfelsitic development; and is found as a\r\n  secondary mineral in all kinds of silicate rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TRIDYMITE.\r\n\r\n▄Usual Appearance in Sections▄: This form of SiO_{2}, which is soluble\r\nin boiling caustic soda, appears in “tile-like” aggregates of minute\r\ncolorless plates (pseudo-hexagonal) and is always secondary. The\r\nrefractive index is extremely low (_n′_ = 1.477), hence the surface\r\nappears rough.\r\n\r\nBetween _crossed nicols_ the interference colors are very low in order\r\n(γ-α = 0.002), and the tablets may show a division into different areas\r\n(optical anomalies). In _convergent light_ an indistinct biaxial figure\r\nis generally seen.\r\n\r\nREMARKS: Chiefly a volcanic mineral, found in rhyolite, trachyte and\r\nandesite. Commonly associated with opal and chalcedony.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CALCITE.\r\n\r\n           ANISOTROPIC.               UNIAXIAL.

(From\r\n    Cohen.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Twinning._—Polysynthetic, parallel to one or more faces of −½ R.\r\n(10̄12). Very common in crystalline limestones, and may have been\r\nproduced by pressure or by the grinding of the section. Shows itself\r\nbetween crossed nicols as a series of light and dark bands, parallel or\r\nintersecting, Fig. 40, about parallel to longer diagonal of cleavage\r\nrhombs. When the composition face of the twins is oblique to the face of\r\nthe section, interference colors can be seen without the analyzer.\r\n\r\n_Color._—Colorless when pure, but may appear colored by transmitted\r\nlight, due to organic pigments.\r\n\r\n_Index of Refraction._—_n′_ = 1.601 (α = 1.487, γ = 1.659) hence with\r\nordinary light _relief_ not marked. Due to the great variation in\r\nrefractive indices of the two rays, with polarized light, the surface\r\nwill appear either quite smooth or rather rough, depending upon which\r\nvibration direction lies over the plane of the polarizer. This marked\r\nvariation in appearance (sometimes called “twinkling”) serves as a good\r\ntest for calcite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 41.—Calcite, section parallel to face of rhombohedron, showing\r\n    rhombohedral cleavage.

Common limestone consists of\r\n  dense aggregates of crystalline grains. Calcite is often a secondary\r\n  product of the lime-bearing silicates in the more basic eruptive\r\n  rocks. Pseudomorphs of calcite after olivine are noteworthy. Coarse\r\n  aggregates of calcite occur in the crystalline schists and contact\r\n  rocks. Calcite is exceedingly plastic to pressure and mechanical\r\n  deformation may be recognized by curving of the cleavage cracks,\r\n  crumpling of the twin lamellæ and “wavy” extinction. Calcite is easily\r\n  attacked and completely dissolved with effervescence by cold dilute\r\n  acids. H., 3.

Crystals almost always unit rhombohedron\r\n(10̄11) with tendency to curved surfaces.\r\n\r\n_Index of Refraction._—_n′_ = 1.622 (α = 1.503, γ = 1.682, γ − α =\r\n0.179), a little higher than that of calcite. For variation in\r\nappearance of surface with polarized light, see under calcite.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic characters are similar to those of calcite, from which\r\nit may be _distinguished_ by not being so easily attacked by cold dilute\r\nacid (test can be made on slide with cover off), by tendency towards\r\ncrystalline boundaries, by absence of twin lamellæ (or when present\r\nparallel to _−2R._ (20̄21), hence about parallel to shorter diagonals of\r\ncleavage rhombs), and by micro-chemical tests. The distinction at times\r\nmay be very difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n  REMARKS: Occurs in sedimentary formations and as crystals in limestone\r\n  and other rocks. In certain rocks the dolomite crystals may not have a\r\n  very good “bond,” and a “drusy” structure may also be characteristic\r\n  of the cavities between dolomite crystals in rocks. Only slightly\r\n  attacked by cold dilute acids, but if acid is heated it dissolves\r\n  easily with effervescence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APATITE.\r\n\r\n           ANISOTROPIC.

H., 4.5 to 5. Sp. gr., 3.19. On account\r\n  of its high sp. gr., apatite, in rock powder, comes down in heavy\r\n  solutions with the metallic minerals, and can be separated from them\r\n  by the use of a magnet.

When present in small interstitial individuals (as is\r\noften the case in basalts) it is very difficult to distinguish without\r\nthis test; but it must be remembered that other minerals, zeolites,\r\netc., will also gelatinize.

The sp. gr. of the pyroxenes is considerably\r\n  higher than that of the amphiboles of similar composition, hence\r\n  mechanical separations are possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Acmite_ (_Ægirine_) (Na pyroxenes).—Occur in green or brown, elongated\r\nprismatic crystals, often not very transparent and with marked\r\npleochroism (like amphibole). Zonal coloring is common. When zonally\r\nintergrown with pyroxene the outer zone is ægirine. The elongation is ∥\r\na′ (distinction from amphibole whose elongation is ∥ c′). The index of\r\nrefraction is higher than in the other pyroxenes (_n′_ = 1.792, α =\r\n1.763, γ = 1.813) and the double refraction stronger (γ − α = 0.050).\r\nThe _extinction_ angle is small (5°) and the optical character (—).\r\n\r\nThe term _Ægirine-augite_ may be used to describe a soda, pleochroic\r\naugite with a large extinction angle.\r\n\r\n\r\n  These pyroxenes are only found in the eruptive rocks rich in alkalies,\r\n  as elæolite-syenite, phonolite, certain trachytes, etc.; hence are\r\n  associated with elæolite, sodalite, leucite, etc. The small, second\r\n  generation, crystals, in the ground mass of a rock, are always the\r\n  richest in Na of the pyroxenes in that rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      AMPHIBOLE, Hornblende, etc.\r\n\r\n           ANISOTROPIC.

(From Cohen.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nCrystals are simple in form of prismatic habit, with prism angle 124°\r\n30′. Cross-sections are acutely rhombic, generally with acute angles\r\ntruncated, hence six-sided (pyroxene being eight-sided). Longitudinal\r\nsections are lath-shaped and fibrous structure may be noticed. Skeleton\r\ncrystals may also occur, being very fine in certain pitchstones.\r\n\r\nZonal structure and parallel growth may be noticed in the amphiboles.\r\n\r\n_Twinning._—Frequent, parallel to ortho pinacoid (100). Twins dual, less\r\noften multiple, Fig. 55. Intergrowths with pyroxene and biotite occur.\r\n\r\n_Color._—From colorless (tremolite), through green (actinolite,\r\npargasite and hornblende) to brown (basaltic hornblende). Yellow in some\r\nvarieties and bluish in the soda varieties.\r\n\r\n_Index of Refraction._—_n′_ = 1.621 to 1.641 (α = 1.607 to 1.629, γ =\r\n1.634 to 1.653) (1.719, in the basaltic hornblende), hence _relief_\r\ndistinct and surface rough.\r\n\r\n_Cleavage._—Perfect, parallel to prism of 124° 30′. Generally appears in\r\nthin sections as sharp cracks crowded close together, Figs. 56 and 57.\r\nMore perfect than in pyroxene.\r\n\r\nSome of the long prisms (actinolite and tremolite) may show transverse\r\nparting.\r\n\r\n_Inclusions._—The iron ores, apatite, etc., may be found in hornblende.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 57.—Hornblende, cross-section.\r\n]\r\n\r\n▄Polarized Light▄:\r\n\r\n_Pleochroism._—All colored amphiboles show pleochroism, which in general\r\nis stronger the darker the color of the variety (actinolite and\r\npargasite show but little). The absorption is very marked in the\r\nhornblendes, being greatest in the general direction of the cleavage\r\nlines in longitudinal sections. Marked differences in absorption are\r\nalso characteristic of the mineral species biotite, tourmaline and\r\nallanite. Pleochroic halos (brownish) surrounding inclusions may be\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\n_▄Crossed Nicols▄_:\r\n\r\n_Double Refraction._—Quite strong, but a little weaker than in pyroxene\r\n(γ-α = 0.019 to 0.027). Ferruginous basaltic hornblende has strong\r\ndouble refraction (γ-α = 0.072).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 58.—Actinolite, clino pinacoid section.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Interference Colors._—Second order, hence bright tints, but in darker\r\ncolored varieties not so noticeable as in pyroxenes, due to the stronger\r\nabsorption of parts of the light. The colors of basaltic hornblende are\r\nso high that they show no bright tints.\r\n\r\n_Extinction._—Always symmetrical in sections (through _b_ axis) showing\r\nintersecting cleavage lines, in such cases bisecting the angles of the\r\ncleavage. In sections showing parallel cleavage lines, only parallel in\r\northo pinacoid (100) sections, in all other sections an extinction angle\r\nbeing observed. The maximum extinction angle lies in the acute angle and\r\nis much smaller than in pyroxene, varying with the chemical composition\r\nfrom 0°–20°. In hornblende, actinolite and tremolite 12°–20°, Fig. 58;\r\nin the basaltic hornblende 0°–10°. The maximum extinction angle is only\r\nobtained when the section of the crystal is parallel to the clino\r\npinacoid (010), varying from this angle to 0°, when the section is\r\nparallel to the ortho pinacoid (100).\r\n\r\n_▄Convergent Light▄_: Axial plane parallel to clino pinacoid (110), Fig.\r\n58. Bx_{_o·_}(c) Λ _ć_ = 0°–20° behind. Axial angles large (2_E_ = 77°\r\nto >180°). Optical character (−). Pargasite is (+).\r\n\r\n▄Alteration▄: May take place to chlorite, talc, serpentine, asbestus,\r\netc., depending on the chemical composition. Amphibole frays out and\r\nbecomes fibrous during alteration, and may also lose color.\r\n\r\n▄Distinguished from▄:\r\n\r\n(_a_) PYROXENE.—By usually much stronger pleochroism in the colored\r\nvarieties, and by cleavage and extinction angle. In pyroxene the\r\ncleavage (parallel to prism of 87° 06′) is less perfect; and the\r\nextinction angle is much larger, varying from 36° to 54°.\r\n\r\n(_b_) BIOTITE.—By the extinction in the mica being always about parallel\r\nto the cleavage. Both have strong absorption, but biotite shows very\r\nslight pleochroism in sections parallel to the cleavage, and has only\r\nthe one cleavage parallel to the base. Also the biotite has lower index\r\nof refraction and generally shows uniaxial interference figure.\r\n\r\nColorless tremolite may be distinguished from muscovite and talc by\r\nextinction angles, relief and lower order interference colors.\r\n\r\n(_c_) TOURMALINE.—By presence of cleavage, and by the fact that\r\nabsorption is most marked about parallel to the elongation (also\r\nparallel to cleavage lines), while in tourmaline the absorption is\r\nstrongest at right angles to the elongation.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The ORTHORHOMBIC PYROXENES.—By extinction angles, the latter\r\nhaving parallel extinction in all sections parallel to _a_, _b_ and _c_,\r\nand by prismatic cleavage of 124° 30′. Pleochroism is strong in the\r\ncolored varieties of both species, but in amphibole it appears more\r\ngenerally as a variation of the same color; while in hypersthene a\r\nchange in color is often noticed, from brownish-red to greenish parallel\r\nto _ć_ axis.\r\n\r\n(_e_) SILLIMANITE and CYANITE.—See under the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n  REMARKS: Amphibole comes next to pyroxene in importance and\r\n  distribution of the dark colored ferruginous rock-forming minerals. As\r\n  a rule it occurs in rocks with a large percentage of SiO_{2},\r\n  associated with quartz and orthoclase; while augite generally occurs\r\n  in rocks of a basic nature, associated with plagioclase and little or\r\n  no free SiO_{2}. Furthermore amphibole contains hydroxyl and is\r\n  therefore naturally found in the deep eruptive rocks; its place being\r\n  taken by augite in the effusives. By application of heat hornblende\r\n  changes to augite, while hydrochemical processes bring about the\r\n  opposite result “uralitization.”\r\n\r\n  Tremolite and actinolite are found in contact rocks and crystalline\r\n  schists, also as a result of the alteration of olivine into\r\n  serpentine. Pargasite occurs in contact rocks. Common green hornblende\r\n  is found in the plutonic rocks (Na poor and SiO_{2} rich), also in\r\n  contact rocks and crystalline schists (amphibolites). Brown hornblende\r\n  replaces the green variety in the basic plutonic rocks. Basaltic\r\n  hornblende is found in many effusive rocks.\r\n\r\n  The hornblende crystals in eruptive rocks, being among the first\r\n  formed constituents, have often suffered subsequent corrosion by the\r\n  magma, giving rise to the dark border already mentioned. The brown\r\n  primary hornblende in some rocks may be changed by a process analogous\r\n  to “uralitization” into a green, reed-like hornblende. Mechanical\r\n  deformations are found in massive and schistose rocks. Light green\r\n  amphiboles, with weak pleochroism, may often be colored intensely\r\n  reddish-brown and made strongly pleochroic by heating to redness on\r\n  platinum foil. In general the amphiboles are not affected by acids.\r\n  H., 5 to 6. Sp. gr., 2.9 to 3.3.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Glaucophane_, _Arfvedsonite_, etc. (Na rich amphiboles).—Occur blue to\r\nbluish-green in color, with pleochroism and weaker double refraction\r\nthan the other amphiboles. Extinction angles vary from 4°–6°\r\n(glaucophane) to 14° (arfvedsonite). They are found in contact rocks,\r\ncrystalline schists, eclogite, etc.\r\n\r\nFor the rarer and less known members of the amphibole group, resource\r\nshould be had to more elaborate works.\r\n\r\n_Uralite._—Pyroxene altered to amphibole, having the outward crystal\r\nform of pyroxene and the physical characters and cleavage of amphibole.\r\nThe change usually commences on the surface and the uralite does not\r\nform a single compact crystal, but consists of numerous slender columns\r\nparallel to one another. These little columns or fibers have their _c_\r\nand [_=b_] axes parallel to the positions of these axes in the parent\r\nmineral. The color is green and the pleochroism weak to strong.\r\n\r\nThis change is called “_uralitization_” and results from hydrochemical\r\nprocesses. When the alteration is not complete, portions of the original\r\npyroxene may be left, having all the characteristic optical properties\r\nof this latter mineral.\r\n\r\n_Anthophyllite_, the orthorhombic amphibole, with always parallel\r\nextinction, is sometimes found in colorless to brownish, blade- to\r\nrod-like aggregates in crystalline schists and serpentine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MICA GROUP.\r\n\r\n           ANISOTROPIC.

When distinctly\r\ncrystallized (magnesium micas) the thin hexagonal plates have plane\r\nangles of 120°, Fig. 59 A. Phlogopite crystals may be extended in\r\ndirection of _ć_ axis.\r\n\r\nZonal structure not uncommon in the magnesium micas, Fig. 59 A, which\r\nmay also have dark iron ore border like hornblende.\r\n\r\n_Twinning._—Common, generally parallel to base; seen in sections showing\r\ncleavage by variations in extinction, in basal sections by distorted\r\ninterference figures.\r\n\r\nMicas of different kinds often associated together in parallel position,\r\nalso intergrown with hornblende, pyroxene, chlorite and quartz.\r\n\r\n_Color._—Depends on chemical composition. Biotites, brown, green or red\r\nto almost opaque. Phlogopites, colorless or yellowish. Muscovites\r\ncolorless.\r\n\r\n_Index of Refraction._—_n′_ = 1.564 to 1.619 (α = 1.541 to 1.580, γ =\r\n1.575 to 1.638), hence somewhat marked _relief_ and surface varies in\r\nappearance from slightly rough to fairly rough. In polarized light the\r\nsurface appears roughest when the cleavage cracks are parallel to the\r\nplane of the polarizer.\r\n\r\nBiotite has more marked relief.\r\n\r\n_Cleavage._—Very perfect, parallel to base (001), Fig. 60. Basal\r\nsections show no cleavage, but all other sections show many sharp,\r\nparallel cleavage cracks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 60.—Biotite, showing basal cleavage, in biotite-granite. (From\r\n    Cohen).\r\n]\r\n\r\nFor percussion and pressure figures, see reference given below.[93]\r\n\r\n_Inclusions._—May be arranged parallel to lines of pressure figure.\r\nRutile needles, tourmaline, apatite, etc., common in magnesium mica.\r\nZircon inclusions often surrounded by pleochroic halos.\r\n\r\n▄Polarized Light▄:\r\n\r\n_Pleochroism._—Varies with the color, being very marked in the colored\r\nvarieties (from pale yellow to chestnut-brown or black). The strong\r\nabsorption, about parallel to the cleavage lines, is very characteristic\r\nof the colored mica, Fig. 59 B. Strong absorption is also noticed in\r\nhornblende, tourmaline and allanite. Absorption may even be noticed\r\naround inclusions (pleochroic halos) in colorless, non-pleochroic micas.\r\nCleavage plates of biotite are not pleochroic unless the axial angle is\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n_▄Crossed Nicols▄_:\r\n\r\n_Double Refraction._—Very strong (γ − α = 0.034 to 0.058).\r\n\r\n_Interference Colors._—High order (third). May be very bright in thin\r\nsections of the colorless micas, and at times be so high in order as not\r\nto show any marked color tints. May not be noticeable in sections of the\r\ncolored varieties, due to absorption of parts of the light.\r\n\r\n_Extinction._—About parallel to cleavage lines. Very small extinction\r\nangles may be noticed in biotites. Basal sections of biotite (the\r\napproximately hexagonal mica) usually appear isotropic.\r\n\r\nMottled appearance (like “Birds-eye” maple) characteristic, caused by\r\ndistortion of the flexible laminæ during grinding. Most noticeable in\r\nsections inclined to cleavage and near position of extinction.\r\n\r\n_▄Convergent Light▄_: Axial plane[94] and Bx_{_a_}, practically at right\r\nangles to basal cleavage; therefore cleavage plates always show well\r\ndefined interference figures, generally biaxial in character. The axial\r\nangles vary greatly, being usually small for biotite and phlogopite (may\r\nappear uniaxial) and large for muscovite (2_E_ = 55° to 90°). Optical\r\ncharacter for all micas (−).\r\n\r\n▄Alteration▄: Biotites decompose quite easily, lose color and may become\r\ncompletely bleached, which appears to be due to a leaching out of the\r\niron. May also alter to green chlorite, with a fraying out of the mica\r\nand a change to chloritic structure.\r\n\r\nPhlogopites may alter to fibrous, scaly masses, apparently chiefly talc.\r\n“Sagenite” webs of rutile may accompany the alteration.\r\n\r\nMuscovites are characterized by their freshness, and do not seem to\r\nsuffer from weathering.\r\n\r\n▄Distinguished from▄:\r\n\r\n(_a_) HORNBLENDE.—Magnesium mica has extinction about parallel to the\r\ncleavage, while hornblende may have extinction angles of from 0° to 20°.\r\nBoth have strong absorption, but biotite shows very slight pleochroism\r\nin basal sections, which also give approximately uniaxial interference\r\nfigures in convergent light.\r\n\r\n(_b_) TOURMALINE.—Magnesium mica shreds show absorption parallel to\r\nelongation, while in tourmaline the absorption is at right angles to\r\nelongation. There is also an absence of cleavage in tourmaline.\r\n\r\n(_c_) CHLORITE.—By strong double refraction, the very high order colors,\r\nhowever, being often not noticed. Chlorite also shows aggregate\r\nstructure and is almost always greenish in color.\r\n\r\n(_d_) TALC.—White mica by large axial angle of scales in convergent\r\nlight and by micro-chemical tests. The distinction may be very\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n  REMARKS: Muscovite is a rare primary mineral in eruptive rocks, except\r\n  in two-mica granite, etc. As a secondary mineral it occurs in dense\r\n  scaly aggregates or as pseudomorphs after feldspar, nephelite, etc. It\r\n  is frequent in crystalline schists and is probably also the mica in\r\n  amphibolite and eclogite. Phlogopite is found chiefly in contact\r\n  metamorphic limestone; and may be distinguished from muscovite by\r\n  nearly uniaxial character and less sharp cleavage. Biotite is much\r\n  more widely distributed, occurring especially in eruptive rocks,\r\n  crystalline schists and contact rocks.\r\n\r\n  Chemical corrosion occurs in original biotite of porphyritic rocks,\r\n  producing a “resorption border” of augite and magnetite. Mechanical\r\n  deformations, producing bending and slipping along “gliding” planes\r\n  (oblique to cleavage), are common to all varieties of mica and may\r\n  produce change to chlorite. The muscovites, together with the\r\n  feldspars, are the most characteristic minerals of dynamo metamorphic\r\n  origin. Biotites and phlogopites are attacked by sulphuric acid at\r\n  high temperatures. Muscovite is but slightly attacked by acids. H., 2\r\n  to 3. Sp. gr., 2.7 to 3.2. The specific gravity separation between the\r\n  micas is difficult on account of the scaly nature of the minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther micas occur, some being alteration products of those already\r\ndescribed. Among these may be mentioned:\r\n\r\n_Lithia Mica._—Both light and dark colored, occurring in granitic rocks\r\nand often only distinguished chemically from muscovite and biotite.\r\n\r\n_Damourite_ (_Sericite_) (hydrous K mica).—A secondary product usually\r\nin colorless, fine scaly aggregates in phillites, sericite-schists, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHLORITE GROUP.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Embracing the members of the Chlorite Group, commonly occurring in\r\n  rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n           ANISOTROPIC.                BIAXIAL.          MONOCLINIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The minerals of this group usually appear uniaxial, and crystallize in\r\n  part with hexagonal symmetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION: May be considered as isomorphous mixtures of\r\nH_{4}(MgFe)_{3}Si_{2}O_{9} and H_{4}(MgFe)_{2}(AlFe)_{2}SiO_{9}\r\n(Rosenbusch).\r\n\r\n▄Usual Appearance in Sections▄: Minute, scaly aggregates, which may\r\nincline to radial grouping; or in minute grains as a pigment (veridite)\r\nin other minerals.\r\n\r\n_Twinning._—May be seen as in mica.\r\n\r\n_Color._—Generally green, varying from greenish white to dark green,\r\nrarely colorless or red.\r\n\r\n_Index of Refraction._—_n′_ = 1.567 to 1.589 (α = 1.560 to 1.585, γ =\r\n1.571 to 1.596), hence no marked relief and only slightly rough surface.\r\n\r\n_Cleavage._—Like mica, very perfect; parallel to flat face, which is\r\nconsidered to be the basal plane. This cleavage may not be noticed,\r\nespecially in secondary chlorite in rocks.\r\n\r\n▄Polarized Light▄:\r\n\r\n_Pleochroism._—In green and yellow tints (green ∥ cleavage), being more\r\nmarked in dark colored varieties. Basal sections are non-pleochroic, the\r\nmineral being practically uniaxial. Pleochroic halos may be seen.\r\n\r\n_▄Crossed Nicols▄_:\r\n\r\n_Double Refraction._—Generally very weak (γ − α = 0.001 to 0.011).\r\n\r\n_Interference Colors._—Very low first order, gray or white, at times\r\nscarcely noticed. Anomalous colors, however, often seen (deep blue or\r\nbrown.)\r\n\r\n_Extinction._—Plates parallel to cleavage generally appear isotropic or\r\nonly show faint color. In other sections extinction is apparently\r\nparallel to the cleavage in the uniaxial type, but extinction angles may\r\nbe noticed when type is biaxial. Complete extinction may not be noticed,\r\ndue to aggregate structure.\r\n\r\n_▄Convergent Light▄_: Plates parallel to cleavage show, at times, an\r\nindistinct interference cross, which may open into two hyperbolas,\r\nindicating biaxial nature of crystallization.

Optical character (±).\r\n\r\n▄Distinguished from▄: SERPENTINE.—By general green color (serpentine,\r\nwith exception of Fe rich variety, is colorless), pleochroism and\r\nfrequent anomalous interference colors; but the distinction between\r\nthese two minerals may be very difficult. Chlorite may resemble\r\ndecomposed or green mica (mica has, however, strong double refraction).\r\nThe different species in the chlorite group cannot usually be\r\ndistinguished in rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n  REMARKS: The chlorites are essentially secondary minerals, derived\r\n  from the aluminous silicates, biotite, augite, garnet, feldspar, etc.\r\n  They are found abundantly in chlorite-schists, contact rocks, etc.,\r\n  and as pigment (veridite) in altered eruptive rocks. May occur as a\r\n  primary constituent of eruptive rocks, often in parallel growth with\r\n  biotite. Chlorides are acted on by hot hydrochloric acid, and\r\n  decomposed easily by sulphuric acid. H., 2 to 3. Sp. gr., 2.6 to 2.96.\r\n  A thin section heated to redness on platinum foil loses water and\r\n  becomes opaque. Ferruginous varieties are turned reddish-brown to\r\n  black by heating (serpentine, as it contains less iron, may give\r\n  negative results with this test).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Delessite._—Found in sphærulites, filling cavities in amygdaloidal\r\nbasic rocks, and in pseudomorphs.

On clino\r\npinacoid with reference to basal cleavage cracks, it is 5°. Some\r\nsections (notably in glassy sanidine grains) may appear dark during\r\ncomplete rotation. This is due to the fact that the axial angle is very\r\nsmall and the sections act approximately like those of a uniaxial\r\nmineral at right angles to the optic axis.\r\n\r\n_▄Convergent Light▄_:[99] Plane of optic axes in general at right angles\r\nto clino pinacoid (010) (plane of symmetry), Fig. 65, hence parallel to\r\ntrace of basal cleavage; but in some sanidines parallel to plane of\r\nsymmetry. Bx_{_a_} (a) Λ _a_ = 5° above. Axial angles vary, 2_E_ = 125°\r\n(orthoclase), 0°–50° (sanidine).[100] May appear uniaxial when axial\r\nangle is very small. Optical character (−).\r\n\r\n▄Alteration▄: Very common to clay,[101] muscovite, hydrargillite, etc.\r\nGenerally commences along the cleavage cracks, and when it has\r\nprogressed very far the whole feldspar appears opaque or cloudy, and no\r\nperceptible change may take place between crossed nicols. As\r\ndecomposition is very prevalent in many rocks, the orthoclase is rarely\r\nclear or pellucid. Epidote is often formed when accessory solutions are\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n▄Distinguished from▄:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The other FELDSPARS and MELILITE.—See under the latter minerals.\r\n\r\n(_b_) QUARTZ.—Feldspar is biaxial but when occurring in clear glassy\r\ngrains (notably sanidine), which appear uniaxial in convergent light,\r\nmay resemble quartz. When tested the optical character is (−), while\r\nthat of quartz is (+).\r\n\r\n\r\n  REMARKS: The members of the feldspar group are the widest distributed\r\n  of the rock-forming minerals and their recognition is of the utmost\r\n  importance on account of their bearing on the systematic\r\n  classification of rocks. Orthoclase is found as an essential\r\n  constituent in the more acid plutonic and older volcanic rocks, as\r\n  granite, syenite, trachyte, porphyry, and also in gneiss, crystalline\r\n  schists, more seldom in contact rocks and subordinate in clastic\r\n  rocks.\r\n\r\n  Chemical corrosion (producing rounded or looped grains), Fig. 6, and\r\n  mechanical deformation (producing angular, sharp-edged, broken grains,\r\n  bending and undulatory extinction[102]), Fig. 7, occur in orthoclase.\r\n  When a rock containing feldspar crystals is shattered, the orthoclase\r\n  breaks parallel to basal cleavage and plagioclase parallel to twinning\r\n  plane. Orthoclase is practically insoluble in acids. H., 6 to 6.5.

This crossed twinning will show\r\nin all sections except those parallel to the brachy pinacoid (010). The\r\nlamellæ are generally thinner than in the plagioclases and more\r\n“spindle-shaped.”[103]\r\n\r\nFurthermore the rather obscure triclinic crystallization is shown by an\r\nextinction angle of + 15° on basal cleavage plates with reference to\r\nbrachy pinacoid (010) cleavage lines (distinction from orthoclase, which\r\nhas O° extinction angle).\r\n\r\n\r\n  REMARKS: Found with orthoclase, often almost replacing it, in granite,\r\n  syenite, gneiss, etc., and is one of the last minerals to form.

The twin lamellæ are\r\nparallel to brachy pinacoid (010), hence not observed in sections\r\nparallel to this pinacoid. The lamellæ may appear irregular and\r\ninterrupted, and seem to be broader in the basic than in the acid\r\nseries. When this twinning fails, however, as in the basic plagioclases\r\nin certain metamorphic rocks, the determination becomes very difficult.\r\nIn some cases polysynthetic twinning, after both _Albite_ and\r\n_Pericline_ laws, may take place at the same time, giving rise to a\r\nstructure somewhat similar to that of microcline, Fig. 72. In addition\r\nthe polysynthetic crystals may be twinned like orthoclase after\r\n_Carlsbad_ and _Baveno_ laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general characters are the same as in orthoclase with the following\r\n                              differences:\r\n\r\n _Indices of Refraction_: _n′_ = 1.535 (α = 1.532, γ = 1.540) Albite.\r\n                          _n′_ = 1.541 (α = 1.537, γ = 1.545)\r\n                            Oligoclase, Ab_{4}An_{1}.\r\n                          _n′_ = 1.559 (α = 1.555. γ = 1.563)\r\n                            Labradorite, Ab_{1}An_{1}.\r\n                          _n′_ = 1.582 (α = 1.575, γ = 1.588) Anorthite.\r\n\r\nThe surface of anorthite appears slightly rougher than that of\r\northoclase.\r\n\r\n_Cleavages_, parallel to base (001) and brachy pinacoid (010), never\r\nintersect at right angles, as is the case in sections of orthoclase\r\nparallel to [_=b_] axis. This is due to the triclinic system of\r\ncrystallization, but the divergence from a right angle is small (93° 36′\r\nto 94° 10′).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 72.—Plagioclase, showing crossed lamellæ, in olivine-gabbro.\r\n    (From Cohen.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Inclusions_ at times may be quite important, as the vitreous inclusions\r\nof oligoclase in andesites, etc., and the iron ore inclusions and other\r\nmicrolites in labradorite. The arrangement of these inclusions may be\r\nzonal or in parallel orientation.\r\n\r\n_Double refraction_ is a little stronger than for orthoclase (γ − α =\r\n0.008 to 0.013 (anorthite)), hence producing slightly brighter\r\ninterference colors in sections of the same thickness.\r\n\r\n_Extinction_ takes place in all sections unsymmetrically with respect to\r\ncrystallographic, twinning or cleavage lines (as these minerals are\r\ntriclinic); hence extinction angles are always observed.\r\n\r\n_▄Convergent Light▄_: All plagioclases show the emergence of a\r\nbisectrix,[107] more or less oblique, on brachy pinacoid (010) cleavage\r\nfaces. These cleavage faces show no twin lamellæ, unless twinning after\r\n_Pericline_ law occurs, in which case the determination is much more\r\ncomplicated.

But of course these methods\r\ninvolve a knowledge of the approximate orientation of the section\r\ntested. When this section is not a definite cleavage fragment, its\r\norientation can best be determined by convergent light tests.\r\n\r\nOnly an outline of these methods can be here given, and reference should\r\nbe made to more complete works for an elaborate discussion of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIt is very convenient to have at hand a set of glass models of the\r\nplagioclases, showing location of plane of optic axes, vibration\r\ndirections and crystal axes.[109]\r\n\r\n(1) _Schuster’s_ method of recognizing the different feldspars by\r\nextinction angles measured on the cleavage plates[110] is very precise,\r\nbut not always applicable for crystals in rock sections.\r\n\r\nEXTINCTION ANGLES:\r\n\r\n                           EXTINCTION ANGLES:\r\n   ON BASE, MEASURED FROM TRACE OF    ON BRACHY PINACOID, MEASURED FROM\r\n        PINACOIDAL CLEAVAGE.

Also in the 45° position the lamellæ\r\nare exactly the same color and the dividing lines disappear. Measure the\r\nextinction angles in as many sections thus selected as possible and take\r\nthe maximum value.[111] This should be very close to the maximum\r\nextinction angle, which is a constant for each kind of feldspar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 73.—Showing conventional signs of extinction angles.\r\n]\r\n\r\n                     MAXIMUM EXTINCTION ANGLES IN\r\n                       SECTIONS PERPENDICULAR TO\r\n                             ALBITE TWINS.\r\n                     Albite                    16°\r\n                     Oligoclase, Ab_{4}An_{1}   5°\r\n                     Labradorite, Ab_{1}An_{1} 27°\r\n                     Anorthite                 53°\r\n\r\nIn the determination of rod-like microlites,[112] oligoclase\r\nextinguishes almost parallel to its length, while anorthite may show\r\nextinction angles of over 27°.

As\r\n  serpentinization proceeds new cracks form, due to increase in volume,\r\n  and the process may continue until complete pseudomorphism takes\r\n  place.

The\r\ngeneral principles involved are the same for both rock and crystal\r\nsections; although more difficulties are encountered in making the\r\nlatter, due to the sections being required in some definite direction or\r\nof some precise thickness, or on account of the possibly fragile or\r\nbrittle character of the crystals.\r\n\r\nIn the case of rock sections any section, taken “at will” through the\r\nrock, will generally do.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Cutting and Grinding Machines.[125]\r\n\r\nMany different kinds are used, the power being furnished by steam,\r\nelectric motor[126] or by the hand or foot.\r\n\r\nThe chip or fragment of rock to be sliced should be comparatively small\r\nin size, and may be cut by either a vertical diamond saw or by a\r\nhorizontal emery-disc. The fragment is held in position by suitable\r\nguides. The moistened emery can be kept in the tray and fed to the disc\r\nby a spoon or some other device. Diamond saws are only needed in the\r\ncase of hard rocks.\r\n\r\nFor cutting sections of crystals in definite directions a form of small\r\nhand apparatus[127] is shown in Fig. 76.\r\n\r\nThis cut shows how the plate, to which the crystal is cemented, can be\r\ngiven definite rotation in two directions. The simpler crystal holder,\r\nappearing loose on the stand, may be used when a section is required\r\nparallel to the face of the crystal cemented to the holder.\r\n\r\nIn these machines the cutting is done with rotating saws of sheet-tin,\r\nusually charged with either diamond dust or emery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 76.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the case of a very small crystal a section, parallel to any desired\r\nface, can be obtained by cementing this face to a suitable frame or\r\nholder and grinding down by hand on a glass plate with emery, the final\r\npolish being given with rouge. When the section required is not parallel\r\nto a crystallographic face or cleavage it must be verified geometrically\r\nwith reference to other faces. If the crystals are soluble in water,\r\nsome other liquid, as α bromnaphthalin or benzine, must be used in\r\ngrinding; and very fragile crystals are rubbed down on a ground glass\r\nplate without emery or rouge, simply using bromnaphthalin or some other\r\nappropriate liquid.\r\n\r\nWhen sections of a crystal are desired with strictly parallel faces, the\r\nform of grinding apparatus shown in Fig. 77 can be used.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus consists of a cylinder, held within a suitable frame\r\nsupported on three set-screws, _a_{1}_, _a_{2}_ and _a_{3}_, of hard\r\nsteel. The lower surface of the frame and consequently the bottom of the\r\ncylinder can be adjusted by the wedge _k_ and the set-screws so that it\r\nis exactly parallel to the grinding surface of the glass plate. The\r\ncrystal to be ground down, _p_, is cemented to the bottom of the\r\ncylinder, and the whole apparatus rubbed over the grinding surface of\r\nthe plate. The pressure of the hand on the upper part of the cylinder\r\nregulates the pressure of the crystal on the grinding surface. In this\r\nway a surface is obtained which is exactly parallel to the surface\r\ncemented to the cylinder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 77.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSections of definite thickness can also be obtained by using this\r\napparatus; for the adjustments with the wedge _k_ may be so arranged\r\nthat, when the stop _t_ in the cylinder has reached the bottom of the\r\nslot in the frame, the lower surface of the cylinder will be the\r\nrequired distance from the grinding surface of the glass plate. The\r\nwedge is graduated so that the value of one division on the sloping top\r\nis known in _mm._ of vertical distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Saws.\r\n\r\nSaws,[128] of about six inches in diameter made from ¹⁄₃₆ inch\r\nsheet-tin, are convenient for general work, and may be charged with\r\ndiamond dust by the operator as follows:[129] Crush one or two carats of\r\nrough crystals of diamond-bort in a small steel mortar to about the\r\ncondition of fine sand, care being taken not to reduce the diamond to\r\npowder. Transfer the dust to a piece of flat iron and, after collecting\r\nit in a heap, moisten with a drop of oil. The cutting edge of the tin\r\ndisk must now be prepared by making a series of incisions (¹⁄₁₆ inch\r\ndeep) on the outer margin. This can be done by striking the disk with a\r\nsharp, thin knife edge. The larger the number of incisions and the\r\ncloser they are together the better. Charging the saw is accomplished by\r\ngently hammering the edge against the iron plate, upon which is the\r\npaste of diamond dust and oil. The disk must be slowly rotated during\r\nthis charging process, which should be continued until all portions of\r\nthe edge have been gone over two or three times.\r\n\r\nInstead of charging with diamond dust the saws may be used with emery.\r\nThe edges of the saws should first be “upset,” as just described, and\r\nthen while rotating charged with emery. The emery in the state of mud\r\ncan be applied with the thumb and fingers, or the saw can be allowed to\r\npass through a tray of emery mud. The finer grades of emery (Nos. 100 to\r\n120) should be used.\r\n\r\nThe method of mounting saws, of course, depends on the way the saws and\r\nspindles are constructed. It is well, however, to have the hole in the\r\ncenter of the saw-disk sufficiently large to allow of adjustment for\r\naccurate centering.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Cutting.\r\n\r\nDuring the process of cutting a lubricant must be used on the saw.\r\nPetroleum has been recommended by some, but water seems to be the most\r\nused. Holding a piece of soap against the cutting edge will also reduce\r\nfriction. It is convenient to carry the water to the saw through a very\r\nsmall lead pipe, which permits of easy adjustment, so that the water can\r\nbe delivered at just the right spot, the flow of water, of course, being\r\nregulated by a stop-cock.\r\n\r\nAnother method for cutting sections is used by the U. S. Geological\r\nSurvey at Washington, D. C. The apparatus consists of an endless wire of\r\nsoft iron, about ³⁄₃₂ inch in diameter, revolving over two pulleys or\r\nwheels, one of which is driven by steam-power. The wire is charged by\r\ndipping the fingers in water, taking up a little fine (120 grade) emery\r\nand holding the fingers against the wire above the section. The wire\r\nrevolves so as to cut downwards, thus carrying with it the emery taken\r\nfrom the fingers.\r\n\r\nIn cutting sections the thickness, of course, depends on the character\r\nof the rock; the more porous and fragile the rock the thicker the\r\nsection should be made, an ordinary section being about as thick as a\r\nsilver quarter of a dollar.\r\n\r\nVery often by skill and practice a suitably shaped chip or fragment can\r\nbe detached from the specimen with a hammer or with a hammer and\r\ncleavage chisels, thus avoiding the delay and trouble involved in the\r\nuse of the section cutter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Grinding Plates or Laps.\r\n\r\nCopper laps, about 7–8 inches in diameter and ½ inch thick, seem to be\r\nbest for general purposes; although laps made of lead or cast iron are\r\nalso used. A lead lap, being soft, holds the emery well and thus hastens\r\nthe grinding away of the section; but at the same time its own smooth\r\nsurface is soon destroyed. A cast iron lap is much harder and retains\r\nits smooth surface better, but does not hold the emery so well and\r\ntherefore retards the process of grinding. Copper, being intermediate in\r\nhardness between lead and iron, seems to combine the advantages of both.\r\n\r\nIt is always good practice to have at least two laps, one for the\r\npreliminary grinding with coarse emery and the other for the final\r\ngrinding with the finest grades of emery. In this way one lap is always\r\nkept with a smooth surface, making it possible to give a uniform, plane\r\nfinish to the section.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the laps should not be exactly plane, but turned or\r\nfinished so as to be a little higher (¹⁄₃₂ of an inch for diameter of 8\r\ninches) at the axis than at the periphery; the idea being to compensate\r\nfor the more rapid abrasive action towards the periphery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Cementing.\r\n\r\nFor grinding down to a proper thinness for transparency it is necessary\r\nto _cement_ the fragment of rock to a holder, which consists of a small\r\npiece of plate-glass about ⅛ inch thick. If the piece of rock has been\r\ncut by a good diamond saw the surface will be comparatively smooth and\r\nuniform, and may only need polishing (described under _grinding_) before\r\ncementing. When, however, the piece of rock is in the shape of a chip or\r\nrough fragment it is first necessary to prepare a smooth ground surface\r\non one side (described under _grinding_) before it can be cemented to\r\nthe glass holder.\r\n\r\nThe pieces of plate-glass used should be free from flaws, bubbles or\r\nanything tending to destroy uniformity of surface, and should be a\r\nlittle larger than the chips and slices of rock for which they are to\r\nact as holders. Hardened Canada balsam, or better yet, a cement made of\r\na mixture of shellac and Venice turpentine,[130] should be used.\r\n\r\nThe process of cementing is carried on as follows: Heat the glass\r\nsupport over an alcohol lamp or a Bunsen burner, place it on a good\r\nnon-conductor of heat, as a piece of wood, and rub it with a stick of\r\nthe cement until a sufficient quantity has been melted off. The piece of\r\nrock should then be treated in the same manner, applying the cement to\r\nthe smooth finished portion. Care must be taken that neither the glass\r\nnor rock preparation are heated too much, as this would cause the cement\r\nto smoke or bubble. After placing the rock preparation and plate\r\ntogether, use quite a little pressure in order to drive out all\r\nsuperfluous cement. Examine now, through the glass, the contact surface\r\nand see that it is entirely free from bubbles, etc.\r\n\r\nBubbles are usually caused by overheating of the parts before cementing.\r\nIf only very few bubbles are seen, they may generally be removed by\r\nmoving the rock preparation rapidly back and forth over the glass plate.\r\nIf the bubbles are numerous or cannot be removed in the manner just\r\ndescribed, the rock preparation must be separated from the glass plate\r\nand the cementing done over again.\r\n\r\nBubbles must _not_ be allowed to remain, as the portions of the rock\r\nover them, not having any cement backing, are ground away leaving holes\r\nin the section.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Grinding.\r\n\r\nAfter the rock preparation has been cemented to its glass holder it is\r\nready for the grinding process, for which are used horizontal laps,\r\nmounted on a vertical spindle in the tray _T_, Fig. 76. The copper lap\r\nfor the first grinding is put in place, and, after it has commenced to\r\nrotate, is charged with emery and water. This can conveniently be done\r\nby dropping on the emery and water, either with the fingers or with a\r\nsmall bunch of rags at the end of a stick. A large camel’s hair brush\r\nmay be used for putting on the finest emery. The emery is distributed\r\nover the rotating lap by the motion of the rock preparation during\r\ngrinding. The kind of emery used for this first grinding depends\r\nsomewhat on the character of the rock section. If the section is\r\ncomposed of a hard, compact, fine grained rock, the first emery used may\r\nbe quite coarse; the coarser the emery the more rapid being the grinding\r\ndown. For rough, quick work, Nos. 80 to 100 emery can be used until the\r\nsection becomes quite thin; then, still using the same lap, substitute\r\nthe finest corn emery (next coarsest to flour emery) and continue\r\ngrinding until the section becomes quite translucent. The lap must then\r\nbe changed, and the grinding finished with the finest emery dust.\r\n\r\nToo great care cannot be given to cleanliness while doing this sort of\r\nwork. A single grain of coarse emery, getting on the lap or section\r\nduring the final grinding, will often spoil the whole work by making a\r\nbad scratch. In grinding down the section, great care must be taken to\r\nsee that the grinding surface is kept parallel to the surface cemented\r\nto the glass. The section is firmly pressed against the lap by means of\r\ntwo or three fingers, depending on its size, and uniform pressure should\r\nbe maintained over all parts.\r\n\r\nThe section should be examined frequently, and if it is noticed that one\r\npart is thicker than another, place the section on the lap so that the\r\nthicker part is towards the periphery, and put a little more pressure\r\nupon this part. Gutting or grooving the copper laps is prevented by\r\nmoving the section from center to periphery and back, at the same time\r\ngiving to it a slight rotary motion. It is best to have the lap revolve\r\nfrom right to left (in the opposite way from the hands of a watch), as,\r\nholding the section on the right side of the lap, it is easier to keep\r\nit in place by a pulling motion rather than by pushing it against the\r\nmotion of the lap. In the final stages of grinding and polishing great\r\nprecaution must be exercised, as one or two turns too many of the lap\r\nwill often tear away a large part of the very thin section. The section\r\nshould be frequently examined, by transmitted light, with a small, low\r\npower microscope, a drop of water or oil being put on the section to\r\nrender it more transparent. If the section is thick and fastened to the\r\nplate-glass with a good deal of cement, it will be found convenient,\r\nafter the section has been ground quite thin, to remove most of this\r\ncement from around its edges. If this is not done, it may delay the\r\nfinal work of grinding down. A good rock section should be made so thin\r\nthat all the transparent and translucent component minerals can be\r\nexamined and studied. Well made rock sections average in thickness from\r\n0.03 to 0.05 _mm._ The last part of the final grinding and polishing can\r\nbe done by the hand on a ground glass plate, using the finest emery dust\r\nor rouge and water.\r\n\r\nFlour emery may also be used entirely for grinding, and the finest emery\r\ndust for polishing. The finer emery makes better work, although it takes\r\nmore time, and is much safer for porous or brittle sections, as the\r\ndanger of tearing away pieces of the section is avoided. In the case of\r\na porous or decomposed rock it is well before grinding to boil the\r\nsection in Canada balsam or other equivalent material so as to fill all\r\nthe pores and interstices, thus making the section more compact and less\r\nliable to chip away. Sometimes it may even be best before grinding to\r\nmount the section on its permanent glass slide, so that when it has been\r\nground thin enough the cover can be put on without running any risk in\r\ntransferring the section. The only objection is that the glass slide may\r\nbe a little scratched by the emery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Mounting.\r\n\r\nWhen the section is sufficiently thin and has a smooth uniform surface\r\nit is ready to be transferred and mounted upon its permanent glass\r\nslide. The glass plate, which has held the section during the grinding,\r\nis gently heated, and, as soon as the cement begins to soften, the\r\nsection is very gently pushed off into a shallow cup or evaporating dish\r\ncontaining turpentine or alcohol. Turpentine is convenient for general\r\nuse, because common alcohol (on account of the water it contains) unites\r\nwith the shellac to form a kind of white pasty substance, which is\r\nsometimes hard to remove from the section. The section should be\r\ncarefully cleaned in the turpentine or alcohol bath by means of fine\r\ncamel’s hair brushes. A section-lifter, made from a piece of broad, flat\r\nwatch-spring fastened to a small handle, is then gently placed under the\r\nsection, which is lifted out of the bath in an inclined position so as\r\nto allow the liquid to drain off. If a drop still adheres it can be\r\nremoved by touching it gently with the finger.\r\n\r\nThe section is now placed in a tray, upon a piece of white, unglazed\r\npaper, so that it may thoroughly dry; after which process it is\r\ntransferred to a glass slide, and, if necessary, its rough edges chipped\r\noff with a knife.\r\n\r\nIf the section is very large, and it is desired to mount it in two\r\npieces, it can easily be divided by holding one half tightly between two\r\nglass slides and gently bending the other half with the fingers. The\r\nfracture will take place along the edges of the glass slides.\r\n\r\nA mixture of gum damar and benzole is recommended for mounting, the\r\nclaim being made that gum damar does not turn yellow with age, whereas\r\nCanada balsam may do so. Two solutions of gum damar and benzole are\r\nused. One very thin, about the consistency of water, the other quite\r\nthick, about the consistency of mucilage. Both solutions are prepared by\r\ndissolving the gum damar in benzole and filtering through a linen or\r\nsilk rag. If the solution is too thin it can be thickened by placing the\r\nbottle in a warm place and allowing the excess of benzole to evaporate,\r\nor if too thick, more benzole can be added. It is convenient to keep the\r\nsolutions in short glass bottles, with wide necks and glass covers\r\ninstead of corks. The solutions can be applied with glass rods.\r\n\r\nWhen the section is all ready for its final mounting it is carefully\r\ncentered with a coarse needle on the glass slide,[131] and a drop of the\r\nthin solution placed at the edge of the section. Capillary attraction\r\nwill cause it to flow over the glass slide under the section, and while\r\nit is soft the section can be again adjusted in place. The slide is then\r\nplaced in a cool, dust proof place and allowed to stand for about twelve\r\nhours, when the cement will be set and the section held firmly in place.\r\nThe upper surface of the section is then washed with a drop of benzine,\r\nand as much as may be necessary of the thick mounting solution placed\r\nupon it with a glass rod. A cover of glass of the right size is gently\r\nheated and placed in position over the section. Care must be taken not\r\nto have the cover too hot, as it would cause bubbles to form in the\r\ncement. It is also best to rest one edge of the cover on the cement\r\nfirst, and then lower it gently so as to prevent air bubbles from being\r\nincluded. The cover is adjusted and then held firmly in position by\r\nmeans of a mounting clamp, which presses out all superfluous cement. If\r\na few small bubbles remain near the edges they may be let alone, as they\r\nwill generally work out by themselves in time. Sometimes a large bubble\r\ncan be worked out by local pressure with the finger and gentle heating\r\nwith a small iron rod. If the mounting is unsatisfactory the cover\r\nshould be removed by heating, the old cement washed off with a camel’s\r\nhair brush and benzole, and a fresh cover put on. After the cement has\r\nset, the clamp may be removed, but the slide should be left for 24\r\nhours, or longer if necessary, until the cement is quite hard. This\r\ntakes longer in hot than in cold weather.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of using two solutions for mounting is that the section is\r\nfirmly held in place on the glass slide while the cover is being placed\r\nover it; there is thus no slipping or sliding of the section, and when\r\nthe cover is adjusted in place the work is well finished and the section\r\nstill in the centre of the slide.\r\n\r\nCanada balsam, or balsam in xylol, are also often used for mounting. The\r\nadvantage of the latter being its quick drying or “setting.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Cleaning and Finishing.\r\n\r\nWhen the cement has set the superfluous part is singed by means of a\r\nsmall hot iron rod. Care must be taken not to use too large a rod or to\r\nhave it too hot, as the cement under the cover might then soften and\r\nallow the cover to slip or air bubbles to form. The singeing drives off\r\nthe more volatile part of the cement, leaving only a brittle residue,\r\nwhich can be easily scraped off with a knife. In some cases it may be\r\nnecessary to singe and scrape twice. The final cleaning is done with a\r\nsoft rag and benzole. The slides are now ready to be marked, either with\r\na diamond pencil or with pasted labels.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Convenient Apparatus for Work in a Petrographical Laboratory:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Section lifters made of watch springs, three sizes.\r\n\r\n  Section holders or clamps for pressing out superfluous cement.\r\n\r\n  Needle points mounted in light handles.\r\n\r\n  Easy spring forceps.\r\n\r\n  Mounting frame for centering section on glass slide.\r\n\r\n  Small iron rod for singeing.\r\n\r\n  Small camel’s hair brushes.\r\n\r\n  Cutting pliers and forceps.\r\n\r\n  Set of wooden section trays.\r\n\r\n  Glass stopper bottles for benzole, benzine, turpentine and alcohol.\r\n\r\n  Open neck bottles, with covers for two mounting liquids.\r\n\r\n  Rotating mounting stand.\r\n\r\n  Small microscope for testing transparency of section.\r\n\r\n  Glass rods.\r\n\r\n  Small squares and rectangles of plate-glass.\r\n\r\n  Round, oval and square cover-glasses.\r\n\r\n  Glass slides with ground edges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n                     CHEMICAL AND MECHANICAL TESTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese tests may be necessary to confirm an optical determination or to\r\nassist in the differentiation of the closely related species of a group,\r\nas for example, the different plagioclases in the feldspar group. They\r\nmay also be useful in the case of opaque substances.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary chemical methods employed in mineral analyses are often not\r\napplicable, on account of the minute size of the mineral under\r\ninvestigation and the lack of sharpness in the reactions. Those\r\nmethods[132] are to be preferred which produce crystallizations\r\nindependent of the relative proportions of the materials taking part in\r\nthe reaction and also of the physical conditions invoked.\r\n\r\nThe tests can be made either on the crystal in a rock section or on the\r\nisolated crystal or fragment, the latter method being preferable when\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n               CHEMICAL TESTS MADE ON CRYSTAL IN SECTION.\r\n\r\nThe part of the section to be tested must be prepared by thorough\r\nwashing with alcohol and benzole to remove all traces of balsam. If the\r\nsection is covered, the cover-glass can be cut across with a diamond,\r\nand, after heating, the desired portion removed with a knife edge. Any\r\nportion of a section can be isolated by surrounding it with a rim of\r\nviscous balsam or by putting on a new cover-glass, in which a small hole\r\nhas been made.[133] This hole can be accurately adjusted over the\r\nspecial portion of the section and the balsam removed by alcohol and\r\nbenzole.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of rock sections with ordinary acids, such as\r\nhydrochloric, may show the presence of easily soluble minerals[134] and\r\ncarbonates, or distinguish silicates that are soluble with jelly, or\r\nproduce etched figures on the minerals.\r\n\r\n_Test for Carbonates._ When only present in very minute grains the test\r\ncan be made as follows: Cover the rock section with a drop of water and\r\na cover-glass, then allow a drop of acid to slowly diffuse through the\r\nwater film. The glass cover will prevent the escape of the gas\r\nbubbles[135] which will thus surely be detected.\r\n\r\nIf necessary the section can be warmed by heating the projecting part of\r\na suitable stand, placed under the section on the stage of the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\n_Test for Gelatinizing Silica._ Cover the carefully cleansed section\r\nwith a little dilute acid (commonly hydrochloric) and let stand. If too\r\nmuch acid is used the resultant gelatin will spread over the whole\r\nsection and not appear simply on the gelatinizing silicate. Warm the\r\nsection, if necessary, and finally rinse off the remaining acid\r\nthoroughly with water. Do not allow the action of the acid to continue\r\ntoo long, as it is desirable to obtain only a very thin film of\r\ngelatinous silica over the minerals attacked, so that the optical tests\r\ncan still be made on these minerals. If after the first trial the action\r\nhas not been pronounced enough, the test should be repeated.\r\n\r\nThe transparent film of gelatinous silica is made more visible by\r\ncovering the section with a drop of water, containing a dilute solution\r\nof fuchsine. After standing for some time the section should be washed,\r\nwhen only those portions covered by the gelatinous film will show the\r\ncolor stain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ETCHED FIGURES.[136]\r\n\r\nThe results of etching tests can not be regarded as very satisfactory in\r\nthe case of sections of minerals in rock sections, on account of doubt\r\nas to the crystallographic orientation of these sections.\r\n\r\nThe symmetry of the etched figures depends essentially on the relation\r\nof the crystal faces on which they are obtained to the planes of\r\nsymmetry.\r\n\r\nThe forms of the etched figures differ on the same face of a mineral,\r\ndepending on the reagent used, but their degree of symmetry is\r\nindependent of the reagent or its degree of concentration. The sharpest\r\nfigures are produced on crystal and cleavage faces, the figures being\r\nless perfect on artificially prepared faces, even when polished. The\r\netching tests may, however, be tried to prove the presence of twinning,\r\nor to distinguish between minerals of similar appearance but belonging\r\nto different systems.[137]\r\n\r\nVarious acids or alkalies are used to produce the etched figures,\r\ndepending on the mineral to be tested. Different factors influence the\r\nformation of good etched figures, and that method must be used which\r\nseems to give most satisfactory results in the given case. The action of\r\nthe reagent should be sufficiently pronounced to develop clearly the\r\netched figures; at the same time the tests must be stopped before the\r\nsolvent action has been too powerful.[138] After treatment for etching\r\nthe section should be thoroughly washed and examined in some fluid of\r\nweak refraction (with _n_ lower than that of the crystal section), such\r\nas water or air.[139] The objective, of course, must be focused on the\r\nsurface of the section.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   HEATING SECTIONS TO REDNESS.[140]\r\n\r\nThe part of the section to be tested must be removed from the object\r\nglass, carefully cleansed of balsam, and held on platinum foil in the\r\noxidizing blowpipe flame. After the test the fragment used may be\r\nremounted in Canada balsam for study.\r\n\r\nAs a result of heating:\r\n\r\nColorless, hydrous minerals (zeolites and chlorites) become cloudy in\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nColorless silicates, containing protoxide of iron (as olivine, or\r\nfaintly colored pyroxene or amphibole), become red or reddish-brown.\r\n\r\nColored minerals may change their color, chloritic substances becoming\r\nbrown or black if heated enough.\r\n\r\nHornblende always becomes pleochroic, and olivine sometimes becomes so.\r\n\r\nMembers of the sodalite group may be turned blue, if not already of that\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nThe dichroism (yellow to blue) of almost colorless iolite may be\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nCarbonaceous particles may be distinguished from the iron oxides by\r\nbeing consumed.[141]\r\n\r\n\r\n  METHODS OF ISOLATING CRYSTALS OR MINERAL FRAGMENTS FOR TESTING.[142]\r\n\r\nFor the application of these methods the rock or aggregate of minerals\r\nshould be reduced to homogeneous[143] grains of uniform size (preferably\r\ncrystals or cleavages) and not to powder. This is best done by pounding\r\nin a metal mortar, avoiding all grinding motion.\r\n\r\nThe separations required may be made by specific gravity solutions or\r\nmagnetic methods, alone or combined; and in some cases may be assisted\r\nby chemical action.\r\n\r\nWhen other methods fail it may be necessary to separate single grains\r\nfrom a mixture by hand. A grooved piece of plate-glass, passed beneath\r\nthe objective of the microscope, will be found useful. The desired\r\ngrains in this groove can be picked out by means of a piece of fine\r\nwaxed thread or a fine pointed stick moistened at the end.\r\n\r\nThe _hardness_ of the homogeneous grains may be obtained by pressing\r\nthem firmly into the end of a lead stamp or holder and trying the effect\r\nof scratching upon the faces of minerals of known hardness.\r\n\r\n_Specific Gravity Separation._[144] Accomplished by use of fluids of\r\ndifferent specific gravity. These fluids can be made specifically\r\nlighter by dilution, and hence the fragments will fall to the bottom in\r\norder of decreasing density. Dilution of the heavy solutions to any\r\nspecific gravity may be affected empirically until the solution will\r\njust suspend a fragment of a mineral having the desired specific\r\ngravity; or the exact specific gravity of the solution may be determined\r\nby the Westphal balance.\r\n\r\nThe following _indicators_ may be employed to determine the limits of\r\nthe specific gravity of the solution to be used for separation purposes\r\n(V.

These two solutions can be mixed with water in any\r\nproportion without being decomposed. Solution of barium mercuric iodide,\r\nmaximum specific gravity, 3.588, cannot be diluted with water. Methylene\r\niodide (CH_{2}I_{2}), specific gravity 3.3243 at 16° C. varying with the\r\ntemperature, can be diluted with benzole but not with water.\r\n\r\nNitrates of silver and thallium[145] (AgNO_{3}: TlNO_{3} = 1.1) fuse at\r\nabout 75° C. to a clear mobile liquid with specific gravity over 4.5.\r\nCan be mixed while melted with water in all proportions; but cannot be\r\nused for separation of sulphides, as these nitrates are attacked by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nPossible chemical action between the minerals and heavy solutions must\r\nnot be overlooked in this method of separation.\r\n\r\nThe funnel-shaped apparatus for these separations must be so arranged,\r\nwith stop-cocks, etc., that the heavier material collected at the bottom\r\ncan be easily drawn off or removed at any stage of dilution.\r\n\r\nThese separations, for various reasons, are not always complete, but the\r\nbest results are obtained when the processes are repeated several times.\r\n\r\n_Electro-magnetic Separation._ All iron-bearing minerals may be\r\nseparated from those free from iron by an electro-magnet.\r\n\r\nThe factors influencing the attraction of a mineral by an electro-magnet\r\nare not definitely known, and do not seem to depend only on the\r\npercentage of iron.\r\n\r\nMinerals, such as amphibole, pyroxene, epidote, olivine and garnet\r\n(containing iron), may often be separated by an electro-magnet by\r\nregulating its magnetic intensity.[146]\r\n\r\n_Separation by Chemical Means._ Very many different methods may be used,\r\ndepending on the nature of the work to be accomplished; but they are\r\ngenerally only reliable in the hands of a good chemist. The material\r\nshould be in the state of fine powder.\r\n\r\nAs an example may be mentioned the treatment with pure concentrated HFl,\r\nby which the minerals of a rock are attacked in a certain sequence, the\r\nfeldspars and related minerals first, then the quartz and finally the\r\nferro-magnesium silicates, such as amphibole, pyroxene, olivine, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MICRO-CHEMICAL REACTIONS.\r\n\r\nThe first requisite is to bring the substance to be investigated into\r\nsolution. This can be done in the case of non-silicates by the ordinary\r\nsolvents, while silicates can be decomposed and investigated either by\r\nthe methods of Borichy or Behrens. Both methods rest upon the\r\nrecognition of the forms, etc., of artificially produced crystals.\r\n\r\nThe size of a fragment for testing may vary, according to circumstances,\r\nfrom that of a poppy seed to a pin head. Good results are recorded from\r\nfragments of not more than 0.2–0.7 sq. mm.\r\n\r\nThe substance to be tested is placed on glass, protected by a film of\r\nbalsam, and covered with a spherical drop of the solvent,[147] which\r\nshould be allowed to act until all the different elements composing the\r\nsample are in solution (in the case of a very small fragment until it\r\nhas all dissolved). Transfer the solution to another protected object\r\nglass, and, after evaporation, the crystallizations characteristic of\r\nthe different elements will be seen.\r\n\r\nIf the evaporation is too rapid and the crystallizations incomplete, the\r\nresidue should be redissolved in water, or a very dilute solution of the\r\nsolvent employed, transferred to a fresh glass and allowed to\r\nrecrystallize.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Borichy’s Method.[148] (Hydrofluosilicic Acid.)\r\n\r\nThis method has the advantage of simplicity of manipulation and relative\r\ndistinctness in results; but on the other hand these results are only\r\nobtained after several hours, and the temperature has an influence on\r\nthe crystalline forms obtained. It is well to make the tests in a\r\ntemperature of about 15° C.\r\n\r\nPut a spherical drop of pure hydrofluosilicic acid[149] on the fragment\r\nand leave it for some hours in damp air until the action has been\r\nsufficient, then transfer it to a dry air bell-glass and allow\r\nevaporation and crystallization to take place.\r\n\r\nFor the microscopic examination the objective (200–300 diams. best for\r\nthese observations) can be protected with glycerine and a mica disc or\r\nthin cover-glass, or the drop can be all evaporated and the crystals\r\ncovered with liquid balsam and a cover-glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n             Crystallizations Obtained by Borichy’s Method.\r\n\r\n_Potassium._ From hydrofluosilicic solutions,[150] isotropic, colorless\r\ncrystals of K_{2}SiFl_{6}, in cubes, octahedra or combinations of these\r\nforms with the rhombic dodecahedron. Apparently orthorhombic crystals\r\nmay form from acid solutions and at a low temperature, but if these\r\ncrystals are dissolved in hot water and recrystallized they will assume\r\nthe normal forms.\r\n\r\nPlatinic chloride will produce under proper conditions sharp, yellow\r\noctahedra of K_{2}PtCl_{6}.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 78.—Fluosilicate of potassium.[151]\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 79.—Fluosilicate of sodium.[151]\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Sodium._ From hydrofluosilicic solutions, colorless, very weakly doubly\r\nrefracting, hexagonal crystals of Na_{2}SiFl_{6}, which are generally\r\nlonger the higher the percentage of sodium in the solution. This test is\r\nvery certain even for small amounts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 80.—Fluosilicate of calcium.[151]\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 81.—Fluosilicate of magnesium.[151]\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Calcium._ From hydrofluosilicic solutions, monoclinic crystals of\r\nCaSiFl_{6} + 2H_{2}O of various forms, generally spindle-shaped, with\r\nnot very strong double refraction. The crystals have seldom\r\nstraight-edged boundaries and are often grouped in rosettes. The\r\naddition of dilute H_{2}SO_{4} decomposes the crystals,\r\nrecrystallization yielding long prismatic crystals of gypsum\r\n(distinction from strontium).\r\n\r\nTreatment with HFl and dilute H_{2}SO_{4} (in excess), producing on\r\nevaporation characteristic crystals of gypsum, furnishes a very delicate\r\ntest for small percentages of calcium.\r\n\r\n_Magnesium._ From hydrofluosilicic solutions, rhombohedral crystals of\r\nMgSiFl_{6} + 6H_{2}O with plane faces and sharp edges. The crystals are\r\ncolorless and strongly doubly refracting with positive optical\r\ncharacter, Fig. 81.\r\n\r\nThe formation of struvite crystals (NH_{4}MgPO_{4} + 6H_{2}O), of\r\ncoffin-like forms, is very characteristic and takes place from very\r\ndilute solutions (rendered alkaline) on the addition of a grain of salt\r\nof phosphorus or a drop of sodium phosphate.\r\n\r\n_Iron._ From hydrofluosilicic solutions, crystals of FeSiFl_{6} +\r\n6H_{2}O, which are isomorphous with those of magnesium salts, with the\r\nsame optical characters. They may be differentiated by moistening with\r\npotassium ferrocyanide or ammonium sulphide, in the first case by\r\nturning blue, in the second case black.\r\n\r\n_Aluminium._ From hydrofluosilicic solutions, not satisfactory on\r\naccount of the gelatinous formation.\r\n\r\nWhen the gelatinous formation is obtained by the action of hydrofluoric\r\nacid on an _aluminous silicate_, the staining test can be used to\r\ndistinguish between fine grains of feldspar and quartz or iolite and\r\nquartz.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Behrens’ Method.[152] (Hydrofluoric and Sulphuric Acids.)\r\n\r\nThis method depends on common reactions that can be made rapidly, but\r\nhas the disadvantage of being rather complicated and requiring delicate\r\nmanipulation.\r\n\r\nThe tests are best made upon about ½ mg. of powder with HFl (pure and\r\nfuming). As soon as the fluorides begin to dry treat with dilute\r\nH_{2}SO_{4} and warm until white fumes of SO_{3} appear. In this way the\r\nHFl and SiFl_{4} are driven off and the sulphates are left. This part of\r\nthe test can conveniently be made on a piece of platinum foil. Add\r\nexcess of water and concentrate.\r\n\r\nTransfer a drop to a clean object glass and, while still liquid, examine\r\nit with the microscope. Do not use a cover-glass over the drop.\r\n\r\n\r\n             Crystallizations Obtained by Behrens’ Method.\r\n\r\n_Potassium._ Add a little platinic chloride when octahedral crystals of\r\nK_{2}PtCl_{6} (size .18 to .30 mm.) will appear, which are clear, bright\r\nyellow in color with strong refraction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 82.—Potassium platinic chloride.[153]\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 83.—Sulphate of calcium (gypsum).[153]\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Sodium._ Use sulphate of cerium and allow a small amount of this\r\nreagent to act through a capillary pipette upon a drop of the solution.\r\nVery small aggregates of brown crystals (size .02 mm.) of the double\r\nsulphate of cerium and sodium are formed, which are clearly visible with\r\n600 diams. If potassium is present the double sulphate of that alkali\r\nwill appear in larger, grayish grains (size .05 to .06 mm.). An excess\r\nof H_{2}SO_{4} is to be avoided.\r\n\r\n_Calcium._ After a few minutes little gypsum crystals (CaSO_{4} +\r\n2H_{2}O) will appear. In strongly acid solutions the thin acicular\r\ncrystals will be grouped in bushes or stars; in neutral solutions the\r\ncrystals will have the normal shape of selenite crystals or form\r\nswallow-tailed twins.\r\n\r\n_Magnesium._ Use salt of phosphorus dissolved in water and allow it to\r\nmix with the solution (to which has been added ammonium chloride and\r\nammonia) through a capillary pipette. From a solution containing more\r\nthan 5 per cent. of magnesium are first deposited X-shaped skeletons and\r\nrudimentary crystals of Mg.NH_{4}.PO_{4} + 6H_{2}O. If the solution is\r\nmore dilute beautiful, sharp, hemimorphic crystals (.10 to .20 mm. in\r\nsize) of the orthorhombic system will appear. These crystals often\r\nresemble the roof of a house. The formation of the crystals is assisted\r\nby heat. Iron and manganese phosphates yield crystals of the same type,\r\nbut the iron is separated on the addition of ammonia.\r\n\r\n_Aluminium._ Use chloride of cæsium. Take a drop of the solution, with\r\nexcess of H_{2}SO_{4} driven off, and touch it with a platinum wire that\r\nhas been dipped in the melted chloride of cæsium. Large crystals\r\n(.40-.90 mm. in size) of cæsium alum will form, which are octahedral and\r\ncubo-octahedral in shape. Iron does not interfere, as its\r\ncrystallization would take place much more slowly. The solution should\r\nnot be too concentrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 84.—Magnesiumammonium phosphate.[154]\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 85.—Cæsium alum.[154]\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Special Tests.\r\n\r\nDistinction between haüynite (contains CaSO_{4}) and noselite (contains\r\nNa_{2}SO_{4}). Treat with HCl and on evaporation the characteristic\r\ncrystals of gypsum will be seen if the mineral is haüynite. Dilute acid\r\nshould be used and as low a temperature maintained as possible,\r\notherwise crystals of anhydrite would form instead of gypsum.\r\n\r\nRecognition of apatite by test for phosphorus. Treat with a drop of\r\nammonium molybdate dissolved in HNO_{3}. After complete action remove\r\nthe solution to a clean object glass, when after slight warming a large\r\nnumber of very small yellow crystals (rhombic dodecahedral in shape)\r\nwill form. The test may be used to distinguish this mineral from\r\nnephelite, melilite and natrolite. In the presence of soluble silica\r\nevaporate to render it insoluble and treat again with HNO_{3} and the\r\nreagent.\r\n\r\nOther micro-chemical tests are not mentioned for the reason that in\r\nelaborate chemical investigations of sections or isolated fragments\r\nrecourse should be made to the most complete publications on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n BRIEF SCHEME OF CLASSIFICATION INTO SYSTEMS BY OPTICAL DETERMINATIONS.\r\n\r\n ▄HOMOGENEOUS.▄     The whole substance shows the same optical\r\n                    character, except in the case of twin crystals when\r\n                    the different portions of the twin are affected\r\n                    differently.\r\n\r\n ▄Isotropic▄        All sections of the substance remain dark during a\r\n                    complete rotation between crossed nicols, and no\r\n                    interference figure is produced by convergent light.\r\n\r\n   Amorphous        Absence of crystalline form or cleavage.\r\n\r\n   Isometric        Presence of crystalline form or cleavage.\r\n\r\n ▄Anisotropic.▄     Sections generally show some interference color and\r\n                    extinguish four times, at 90° apart, during complete\r\n                    rotation.\r\n\r\n _Uniaxial._        Determined by character of interference figures\r\n                    obtained by convergent light from sections which\r\n                    remain dark or nearly so during complete rotation.\r\n\r\n                    All sections show parallel or symmetrical\r\n                    extinction.\r\n\r\n   Tetragonal       Sections giving interference figures are four- or\r\n                    eight-sided, or show rectangular cleavage.\r\n\r\n   Hexagonal        Sections giving interference figures are three-,\r\n                    six- or nine-sided, or show cleavage lines\r\n                    intersecting at 60°.\r\n\r\n _Biaxial_          Determined by character of interference figures\r\n                    obtained by convergent light.\r\n\r\n   Orthorhombic     Extinction is parallel or symmetrical in all\r\n                    sections parallel to _ă_, [_=b_] and _ć_.

Minor accessories (apatite, zircon, sphene, garnet, etc.) and iron\r\nores.\r\n\r\n“2. Ferro-magnesian minerals—olivine, rhombic pyroxenes, augite,\r\nægirine, hornblende, biotite, muscovite.\r\n\r\n“3. Felspathic minerals—plagioclase felspars (in order from anorthite to\r\nalbite), orthoclase (and anorthoclase).\r\n\r\n“4. Quartz, and finally microcline.\r\n\r\n“In most rocks such minerals as are present follow the above order. The\r\nmost important exceptions are the intergrowth of orthoclase and quartz\r\nand the crystallization of quartz in advance of orthoclase in some acid\r\nrocks, and the rather variable relations between groups 2 and 3 in some\r\nmore basic rocks. The order laid down applies in general to parallel\r\nintergrowths of allied minerals; thus when augite is intergrown with\r\nægirine or hornblende the former mineral forms the kernel of the complex\r\ncrystal and the latter the outer shell; when a plagioclase crystal\r\nconsists of successive layers of different compositions the layers\r\nbecome progressively more acid from the center to the margin.\r\n\r\n“Certain constituents having variable relations are omitted from the\r\nforegoing list. Thus nepheline (elæolite) and sodalite belong to group\r\n3, but may crystallize out either before or after the feldspar.”[157]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            OPTICAL SCHEME.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scheme is designed to furnish the student with a practical method of\r\n           recognizing the common minerals in rock sections.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement followed has been to group minerals having general\r\noptical characters in common, at the same time giving their specific\r\ncharacters so as to make it possible to distinguish one from another. In\r\neach rectangle the minerals are arranged in order of their indices of\r\nrefraction.\r\n\r\nA tabulation of the minerals, with a list of optical characters\r\nappended, is of aid to the skilled investigator, but of very little\r\nassistance to the beginner.\r\n\r\nThe more common minerals, or those which are important petrographically,\r\nare printed in heavy-faced type; the minerals of less importance in\r\nsmall capitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ABBREVIATIONS AND CONVENTIONS USED.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A. = Amorphous.\r\n\r\n  I. = Isometric system.\r\n\r\n  T. = Tetragonal system.\r\n\r\n  O. = Orthorhombic system.\r\n\r\n  M. = Monoclinic system.\r\n\r\n  Tri. = Triclinic system.\r\n\r\n  H. = Hexagonal system.\r\n\r\n  M(H). = Monoclinic, with hexagonal form or characters, as in the case\r\n  of biotite.\r\n\r\n  ⟂ = At right angles to.\r\n\r\n  El. = Elongation.\r\n\r\n  Ex. = Extinction.\r\n\r\n  ∥ Ex. = Parallel extinction, as when the crystals extinguish parallel\r\n  to cleavage lines or crystal edges. Extinction which is symmetrical to\r\n  intersecting cleavage lines is also included under this term.\r\n\r\n  The mean refractive indices are printed in heavy-faced type.\r\n\r\n  The term “grains” is used to describe not only minerals which occur in\r\n  typically granular form, but also those which have coarser\r\n  allotriomorphic form, as elæolite and sodalite in plutonic rocks, such\r\n  as syenite, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    GENERAL RULES FOR USE OF SCHEME.\r\n\r\nThe division of the scheme into two vertical columns is based on the\r\nvalues of the mean refractive indices, as determined by the “relief” and\r\nappearance of the surface. When the refractive index is above 1.60, the\r\nrelief is fairly well to distinctly marked and the surface rough to very\r\nrough, depending on the value of the index.\r\n\r\nMost of the rock-forming minerals with indices below 1.60 show no relief\r\nand a smooth surface, except in the case of a few of the rarer minerals\r\n(mostly isometric), which have very low indices and hence rough surface.\r\n\r\nMistakes may easily be made in the case of minerals near the limit; but\r\npractice and the use of the Becke test should soon make possible the\r\nclassification into the two groups suggested by the scheme, and the\r\nappended descriptions will help to check errors.\r\n\r\nWhen an unknown mineral lies adjacent to one that is known, use the\r\nBecke test for obtaining the relative refractive index of the unknown\r\nmineral; focus sharply on the line of contact between the known and\r\nunknown minerals,[158] then raise the objective slightly and the “bright\r\nline” will appear on the side of the mineral having the higher index.\r\nThe method of Schrœder van der Kolk may also be employed, see p. 22.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal divisions of the scheme depend on the relative strength\r\nof the double refraction based on the observed interference colors.\r\nThese colors to be of use in classification must be correctly\r\nrecognized. The lower and middle colors of the 1° order, from\r\nbluish-gray through white to yellow, are easily known. The bright red,\r\nblue, green, etc., colors of the 1°, 2° and 3° orders can also be\r\ndifferentiated without trouble from the very high order colors (4° and\r\nabove), which are essentially white in tone with no decided color tint.\r\n\r\nWhen confusion arises, the exact order of the color can be determined by\r\na quartz wedge, as given on p. 35. Furthermore, a ¼ undulation mica\r\nplate serves to quickly distinguish between the 1° order white and the\r\npractically colorless, high order tint of calcite, titanite, etc.; as\r\nafter the insertion of the test-plate the 1° order white suffers a\r\nmarked change in color, while the very high order (practically white)\r\ntint shows no appreciable change.\r\n\r\nIn the determination of these interference colors care must be given to\r\nconsiderations of orientation and thickness. The section must give the\r\nmaximum interference color of all the obtainable sections of the mineral\r\nin the rock section. Such sections will be parallel to the _ć_ axis in\r\nthe uniaxial minerals and to the axial plane in the biaxial minerals;\r\nand will, therefore, in convergent light never show the emergence of an\r\noptic axis or bisectrix. Crystal “form,” cleavage, pleochroism, etc.,\r\nmay at times aid in the selection of these sections. The thickness of\r\nthe section must also be considered, and it is well in all cases to pick\r\nout some known mineral in the section, as quartz, and note its maximum\r\ninterference color. Knowing how this varies from the color given by the\r\nscheme for a section 0.03 mm.[159] in thickness, due allowance can be\r\nmade for a like variation in the colors given by the other minerals. In\r\nthe case of minerals with strong absorption the interference colors may\r\nnot be noticeable on account of the absorption of parts of the light.\r\n\r\nUnder the subhead of pleochroism, the vibration direction of the ray of\r\na definite color is given and not the direction of transmission of that\r\nray.\r\n\r\nThe interference figures in convergent light increase in clearness and\r\ndistinctness with the strength of the double refraction. In uniaxial\r\ncrystals sections at right angles to the optic axis, _i. e._, sections\r\nwhich remain dark during a revolution between crossed nicols, show the\r\nbest interference figures. In biaxial crystals the most characteristic\r\ninterference figures are shown by sections at right angles to the acute\r\nbisectrix.\r\n\r\nCrystal sections which are too small do not give very satisfactory\r\ninterference figures with convergent light.[160]\r\n\r\nAny scheme, however designed, makes a more or less arbitrary\r\nclassification of the minerals, and when in doubt it is always safer to\r\nlook for the mineral on both sides of the scheme line.\r\n\r\nThe rarer minerals are not included in this scheme, so when the\r\ndetermination of a mineral is uncertain or not positive recourse should\r\nbe had to more elaborate tables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   MINERAL NAMES IN HEAVY-FACED TYPE.\r\n\r\n Abbreviations, ix\r\n\r\n Abnormal interference colors, 30\r\n\r\n Absorption, 26\r\n   directions, 26\r\n   tints, 17\r\n\r\n ▄Acmite▄, 83\r\n\r\n ▄Actinolite▄, 84\r\n\r\n Acute bisectrix, 5\r\n\r\n ▄Ægirine▄, 83\r\n\r\n ▄Ægirine-augite▄, 84\r\n\r\n Aggregate structure, 38\r\n\r\n ▄Albite▄, 103\r\n\r\n ▄Allanite▄, 96\r\n\r\n Allotriomorphic, 15\r\n\r\n Aluminium, test for, by Borichy’s method, 137\r\n   test for, by Behren’s method, 139\r\n\r\n Amorphous bodies, 2\r\n\r\n Amorphous substances, test for, 26\r\n\r\n ▄Amphibole▄, 84\r\n\r\n ▄Analcite▄, 56\r\n\r\n Analyzer, 10\r\n\r\n ▄Andalusite▄, 72\r\n\r\n Anhedron, 15\r\n\r\n Anisotropic character, test for, 27\r\n\r\n Anisotropic crystals, 2\r\n\r\n Anomalies, optical, 27\r\n\r\n ▄Anorthite▄, 103\r\n\r\n ▄Anorthoclase▄, 113\r\n\r\n ▄Anthophyllite▄, 88\r\n\r\n ▄Antigorite▄, 114\r\n\r\n ▄Apatite▄, 68\r\n\r\n Apatite, recognition of, by test for phosphorus, 139\r\n\r\n Apparatus for petrographical laboratory, 127\r\n\r\n Appendix, 141\r\n\r\n ▄Arfvedsonite▄, 88\r\n\r\n ▄Augite▄, 80\r\n\r\n Automorphic, 13\r\n\r\n Axes of elasticity, 4\r\n\r\n Axial angle, 5\r\n   determination of, 47\r\n\r\n Axial plane, 5\r\n\r\n\r\n ▄Basaltic Hornblende▄, 85\r\n\r\n ▄Bastite▄, 77\r\n\r\n Becke’s method for determining relative values of refractive indices,\r\n    19\r\n\r\n Behren’s method.

In the Fuess microscope use\r\n  objective No. 4 for general use and No. 7 for convergent light tests.\r\n  In the case of an English microscope a 1″ to ¾″ objective is used for\r\n  general purposes and a ¼″ to ⅕″ for observations with convergent\r\n  light.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  See pp. 33 and 34.\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  In some microscopes the analyzer is in the form of a “cap” nicol,\r\n  arranged to be fitted over the top of the eye-piece, and not\r\n  introduced in the microscope tube as shown here. This form is not so\r\n  convenient, as the “cap” nicol must be set by hand every time it is\r\n  desired to make observations with crossed nicols. But at the same time\r\n  it avoids any possible refocusing which may be necessary when the\r\n  other type of analyzer is introduced in the tube.\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  When accurate adjustments are possible of the vibration planes of the\r\n  nicols and the cross-wires parallel to these vibration planes,\r\n  reference should be made to _Methods of Petrographic-Microscopic\r\n  Research_, p. 61, 1911, Fred. E. Wright.\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  In the Seibert microscope eye-piece No. 0 is used for most purposes.\r\n  Other eye-pieces, Nos. 1 and 2, with cross-wires, are used for\r\n  different degrees of magnification, and one eye-piece, No. 3, without\r\n  cross-wires, is provided to be used in connection with an eye-piece\r\n  micrometer.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  With the Seibert microscope, Fig. 2, the No. 0 eye-piece and the No.\r\n  II objective will prove most satisfactory for the following tests.\r\n  With the Fuess microscope use No. 4 objective. With an English\r\n  microscope use an ordinary eye-piece and a 1″ or ¾″ objective.\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  Twins may be recognized just as in macroscopic specimens, and zonal\r\n  structure noticed if the zones differ in color. When a colorless\r\n  mineral is surrounded by other colorless minerals, of about the same\r\n  index of refraction, its outline is often best brought out by\r\n  observation between crossed nicols.\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  The term “Anhedron,” meaning without planes, has been suggested by L.\r\n  V. Pirsson to describe in rocks the crystal fragments which have no\r\n  plane faces, as, for example, the augites of augitic rocks. _Science_,\r\n  Jan. 10, 1896, p. 49.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  Partial resorption and recrystallization may produce a border of\r\n  secondary minerals, surrounding the original crystal.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  The surfaces of all minerals in sections are more or less rough, but\r\n  this roughness is only made visible when there is a marked difference\r\n  between the indices of refraction of the minerals, and the index of\r\n  refraction of the balsam in which the minerals are embedded. The index\r\n  of refraction of balsam is about 1.54, so it is only when the mineral\r\n  has a higher or lower index of refraction that its surface appears\r\n  rough. When internal structure is to be studied, the crystal should be\r\n  surrounded by a fluid of nearly the same index of refraction as that\r\n  of the crystal, and when the exterior of the crystal is to be studied,\r\n  then a fluid should be used with a very different index of refraction.\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  The Seibert microscope has a very convenient and quick lowering\r\n  adjustment, by means of the lever _d_, for making this test. For\r\n  convenience the lower nicol and condensing lens are generally left in\r\n  place below the stage of the microscope, as polarized light serves as\r\n  well for these investigations as ordinary light. An additional\r\n  advantage in this arrangement is that the condensing lens is always\r\n  ready for the “relief” test and the lower nicol for the pleochroism\r\n  test; but it must be remembered that the polarizer or lower nicol cuts\r\n  out one half of the light, which comes to it from the reflector, and\r\n  this loss is important when high power objectives are to be used. When\r\n  very low power objectives are used, the condensing lens must be\r\n  removed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  _Mem. de l’Acad._, Paris, 1767–68.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  _Min.

Wright, 1911, p.\r\n  93.\r\n\r\n  This method is particularly favorable for the accurate determination\r\n  of the refractive indices of small isolated fragments or grains, by\r\n  using liquids of known indices. In this case a bright line appears on\r\n  the “near” edge and a dark line on the “far” edge if the grain has a\r\n  higher index than the liquid. The reverse occurs when the index is\r\n  lower than the liquid. When the index is the same (using white light)\r\n  the “far” edge is blue and the “near” edge red and also the contours\r\n  about disappear.\r\n\r\n  F. Krantz, of Bonn, furnishes a series of 21 liquids in small bottles,\r\n  with indices from 1.447 to 1.83.\r\n\r\n  The indices of a few convenient liquids are: water, 1.34; alcohol,\r\n  1.36; glycerine, 1.41; olive oil, 1.47; nut oil, 1.50; clove oil,\r\n  1.54; aniseed oil, 1.58; almond oil, 1.60; cassia oil, 1.63;\r\n  monobromnapthalene, 1.65; methylene iodide, 1.75.\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  Crystals that have two good cleavages often develop so that the\r\n  direction of elongation is parallel to the intersection of the two\r\n  cleavages, while in the case of crystals with one good cleavage the\r\n  tendency seems to be towards a tabular habit parallel to the cleavage.\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  Harker’s _Petrology for Students_, p. 306.\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  The lower nicol is generally so adjusted that its plane of vibration\r\n  is parallel to the north and south cross-wire in the eye-piece. This\r\n  adjustment can be tested by means of a section of biotite, showing\r\n  cleavage cracks. When the plane of vibration of the polarizer is\r\n  parallel to the N. and S. cross-wire in the eye-piece, the biotite\r\n  section becomes almost dark when its cleavage cracks are parallel to\r\n  the same cross-wire. The upper nicol, or analyzer, must, of course, be\r\n  removed during this test. This method is more convenient than taking\r\n  the nicol out of its frame, in order to ascertain its plane of\r\n  vibration (the direction of its shorter diagonal).\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  Although the “absorption directions” may not necessarily coincide with\r\n  the principal vibration directions in Monoclinic and Triclinic\r\n  crystals; still for convenience the absorption colors are usually\r\n  given for the light rays vibrating parallel to these principal\r\n  vibration directions.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  In the Fuess and Seibert microscopes the analyzer or upper nicol is so\r\n  fitted that it slides in and out of the tube of the microscope with\r\n  its plane of vibration always at right angles to the plane of\r\n  vibration of the polarizer or lower nicol.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  Moses’ _Characters of Crystals_, p. 106.

The gypsum plate is a thin\r\n  cleavage of gypsum, on which is usually marked a, the vibration\r\n  direction of the faster ray. The chosen thickness is such as to\r\n  produce the red interference color of the 1° order.\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  The test-plates are generally introduced in the slot _k_, in a\r\n  microscope of the Seibert type, or if a cap-nicol is used in a slot\r\n  below this. In case no provision is made by the instrument maker for\r\n  these test-plates, the regular analyzer is left out of the tube, and a\r\n  simple nicol prism is used as an analyzer and is held by the observer\r\n  over the eye-piece. Care must be taken to have the plane of vibration\r\n  of this nicol at right angles to that of the polarizer, and to leave\r\n  sufficient room for the introduction, by hand, of the test-plate\r\n  between the eye-piece and the nicol. With care the plates can be\r\n  introduced with sufficient accuracy to make the test practical.\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  A scale or chart of interference colors, or the interference color\r\n  diagram, should be before the observer in order to avoid any mistakes\r\n  as to whether the new color is higher or lower in the scale.\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  The quartz wedge is cut so that one of its faces is exactly parallel\r\n  to the _ć_ axis (hence also parallel to the _c_ vibration direction)\r\n  while the other face makes a very small angle with it.

This\r\n  optical character or sign is (+) when the principal zone axis or the\r\n  direction of elongation is parallel to c and (−) when parallel to a.\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  Iddings’ _Rock Minerals_, 1911, p. 172.\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  This assumes the optic axes for different colors to emerge about at\r\n  the same points. If there is marked “dispersion” the black bands and\r\n  hyperbolas may be rainbow-hued, as with titanite.\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  The interference figure, perpendicular to the _obtuse bisectrix_,\r\n  would be of the same type with a larger axial angle. Ordinarily this\r\n  figure would not come within the limits of the field of view of the\r\n  microscope. Confusion may arise, however, but in a section\r\n  perpendicular to the acute bisectrix the cross dissolves more slowly\r\n  into the hyperbolas than in the case of a section perpendicular to the\r\n  obtuse bisectrix. At times it may be necessary to measure the axial\r\n  angle to be sure. When, however, the mineral is known, the section\r\n  perpendicular to the acute bisectrix can be recognized, because if the\r\n  mineral is optically positive the trace of the axial plane is parallel\r\n  to a and if negative parallel to c.\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  For construction of quartz wedge, see p. 34.\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  The wedge can be introduced in either of the several ways described\r\n  for the introduction of the test-plates on p. 33.\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  For methods of measuring the axial angle, see _Methods of\r\n  Petrographic-Microscopic Research_, F. E. Wright, 1911, p. 147.\r\n\r\n  For convenience in many cases only 2_E_ is recorded, as then an\r\n  indication is given as to whether the axial angle is visible with an\r\n  ordinary microscope (arranged for observation with convergent light\r\n  for interference figures). If 2_E_ is very large the axial angle can\r\n  only be observed by covering the section with some transparent,\r\n  strongly refracting fluid. For the Seibert microscope with objective V\r\n  the limit for good results is about 2_E_ = 90°–100°.\r\n\r\nFootnote 79:\r\n\r\n  For dispersion, etc., see A. J. Moses’ _Characters of Crystals_, p.\r\n  140.\r\n\r\nFootnote 80:\r\n\r\n  The system of crystallization of leucite has been the subject of much\r\n  discussion. Its habit is isometric. The consensus of opinion seems to\r\n  be that leucite crystallizes in the isometric system, but that the\r\n  isometric molecular arrangement, at least of the larger crystals,\r\n  cannot exist for the temperature and pressure at the earth’s surface.\r\n  Hence molecular displacement takes place, giving rise to a more or\r\n  less complicated apparent twinning, and optical anomalies are noticed.\r\n  The isotropic character returns if the section is heated to 500° C.\r\n  Iddings’ _Rock Minerals_, p. 249, 1911.\r\n\r\nFootnote 81:\r\n\r\n  C.

In most cases only\r\n  the black hyperbolas are seen, without any colored curves.\r\n\r\nFootnote 100:\r\n\r\n  By heating feldspar crystals the axial angle decreases to 0° and then\r\n  increases in the plane of symmetry (at right angles to its former\r\n  position). On cooling the axial angle returns to its former position\r\n  if the temperature has not exceeded 500° C. If the temperature has\r\n  been 600°–1000° C. for some time the axial angle will not return to\r\n  its former position. This fact may give some clew as to the\r\n  temperature at which the feldspar crystals formed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:\r\n\r\n  This change to kaolin or clay in granite is called by Dolomieu “_La\r\n  maladie du granit_.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 102:\r\n\r\n  See p. 31.\r\n\r\nFootnote 103:\r\n\r\n  Hatch’s _Introduction to the Study of Petrology_, p. 33.\r\n\r\nFootnote 104:\r\n\r\n  J.

If a fragment with only one\r\n  cleavage surface is obtained, it must be cemented to a glass by this\r\n  surface and ground down to a thin section with parallel sides.\r\n\r\nFootnote 111:\r\n\r\n  This test is only possible when suitable sections of the given\r\n  feldspar in the rock section can be found. The method, however, can be\r\n  used with great accuracy with the aid of some form of apparatus for\r\n  properly orienting the section. See “Klein’s Apparatus for the\r\n  Orientation of Thin Sections,” _Sitzungsber. Berlin. Akad._, 1895,\r\n  1151; (also in _N. Y. Acad.

Labradorite is the commonest product of the consolidation of the\r\n  basic eruptives, and albite almost invariably results from\r\n  metamorphism, frequently from the contact of igneous rocks on the\r\n  calcareous clastics.” N. H. Winchell, Determination of the Feldspars,\r\n  _Am. Geol._, Vol. XXI, No. 1, p. 33, 1898.\r\n\r\nFootnote 113:\r\n\r\n  These methods (both 2 and 3) are often not applicable on account of\r\n  the tendency of the crystals in an effusive rock to parallel\r\n  orientation, which may be so marked that the rock section does not\r\n  show any favorable sections of the plagioclase.\r\n\r\nFootnote 114:\r\n\r\n  These extinction angles, as well as those previously given, are those\r\n  of only a few type feldspars of definite composition. As the\r\n  composition varies through a long series, so the extinction angle\r\n  changes, one being a function of the other.\r\n\r\n  For a complete list of compositions and related extinction angles, see\r\n  Iddings’ _Rock Minerals_ and Lévy & Lacroix’s _Les Minéraux des\r\n  Roches_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 115:\r\n\r\n  Iddings’ _Rock Minerals_, p. 228, Wiley & Sons, 1911. _Étude sur la\r\n  Détermination des Feldspaths_ (troisième fascicule), Michel Lévy,\r\n  Paris, 1904.\r\n\r\nFootnote 116:\r\n\r\n  In quartz ω is the refractive index of the ray with vibration\r\n  direction ∥ a [that is the direction of vibration of the faster ray\r\n  (the ordinary ray)].
