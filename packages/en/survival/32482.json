Multhauf is head curator of the department\r\n     of science and technology in the United States National Museum,\r\n     Smithsonian Institution._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flowering of science in the 17th century was accompanied by an\r\nefflorescence of instrument invention as luxurious as that of science\r\nitself. Although there were foreshadowing events, this flowering seems\r\nto have owed much to Galileo, whose interest in the measurement of\r\nnatural phenomena is well known, and who is himself credited with the\r\ninvention of the thermometer and the hydrostatic balance, both of which\r\nhe devised in connection with experimentation on specific scientific\r\nproblems. Many, if not most, of the other Italian instrument inventors\r\nof the early 17th century were his disciples. Benedetto Castelli, being\r\ninterested in the effect of rainfall on the level of a lake, constructed\r\na rain gauge about 1628. Santorio, well known as a pioneer in the\r\nquantification of animal physiology, is credited with observations,\r\nabout 1626, that led to the development of the hygrometer.\r\n\r\nBoth of these contemporaries were interested in Galileo's most famous\r\ninvention, the thermoscope--forerunner of the thermometer--which he\r\ndeveloped about 1597 as a method of obtaining comparisons of\r\ntemperature. The utility of the instrument was immediately recognized by\r\nphysicists (not by chemists, oddly enough), and much ingenuity was\r\nexpended on its perfection over a 50-year period, in northern Europe as\r\nwell as in Italy. The conversion of this open, air-expansion thermoscope\r\ninto the modern thermometer was accomplished by the Florentine Accademia\r\ndel Cimento about 1660.\r\n\r\nGalileo also inspired the barometer, through his speculations on the\r\nvacuum, which, in 1643, led his disciple Torricelli to experiments\r\nproving the limitation to nature's horror of a vacuum. Torricelli's\r\napparatus, unlike Galileo's thermoscope, represented the barometer in\r\nessentially its classical form. In his earliest experiments, Torricelli\r\nobserved that the air tended to become \"thicker and thinner\"; as a\r\nconsequence, we find the barometer in use (with the thermometer) for\r\nmeteorological observation as early as 1649.[1]\r\n\r\nThe meetings of the Accademia terminated in 1667, but the 5-year-old\r\nRoyal Society of London had already become as fruitful a source of new\r\ninstruments, largely through the abilities of its demonstrator, Robert\r\nHooke, whose task it was to entertain and instruct the members with\r\nexperiments. In the course of devising these experiments Hooke became\r\nperhaps the most prolific instrument inventor of all time. He seems to\r\nhave invented the first wind pressure gauge, as an aid to seamen, and he\r\nimproved the bathometer, hygrometer, hydrometer, and barometer, as well\r\nas instruments not directly involved in measurement such as the vacuum\r\npump and sea-water sampling devices. As in Florence, these instruments\r\nwere immediately brought to bear on the observation of nature.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear, however, that we would be justified in concluding\r\nthat the rise of scientific meteorology was inspired by the invention of\r\ninstruments, for meteorology had begun to free itself of the traditional\r\nweather-lore and demonology early in the 17th century. The Landgraf of\r\nHesse described some simultaneous weather observations, made without\r\ninstruments, in 1637. Francis Bacon's \"Natural History of the Wind,\"\r\nconsidered the first special work of this kind to attain general\r\ncirculation, appeared in 1622.[2] It seems likely that the rise of\r\nscientific meteorology was an aspect of the general rationalization of\r\nnature study which occurred at this time, and that the initial impetus\r\nfor such progress was gained not from the invention of instruments but\r\nfrom the need of navigators for wind data at a time when long voyages\r\nout of sight of land were becoming commonplace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1.--A set of typical Smithsonian meteorological\r\ninstruments as recommended in instructions to observers issued by the\r\nInstitution in the 1850's. _Top_ (from left): maximum-minimum\r\nthermometer of Professor Phillips, dry-bulb and wet-bulb thermometers,\r\nand mercurial barometer by Green of New York. _Lower left:_ rain gauge.\r\nThe wet-bulb thermometer, although typical, is actually a later\r\ninstrument.

(_Smithsonian photo 46740._)]\r\n\r\nIt should be noted in this connection that the two most important\r\ninstruments, the thermometer and barometer, were in no way inspired by\r\nan interest in meteorology. But the observation made early in the\r\nhistory of the barometer that the atmospheric pressure varied in some\r\nrelationship to visible changes in the weather soon brought that\r\ninstrument into use as a \"weather glass.\" In particular, winds were\r\nattributed to disturbances of barometric equilibrium, and\r\nwind-barometric studies were made by Evangelista Torricelli, Edmé\r\nMariotte, and Edmund Halley, the latter publishing the first\r\nmeteorological chart. In 1678-1679 Gottfried Leibniz endeavored to\r\nencourage observations to test the capacity of the barometer for\r\nforetelling the weather.[3]\r\n\r\nOther questions of a quasi-meteorological nature interested the\r\nscientists of this period, and brought other instruments into use.\r\nObservations of rainfall and evaporation were made in pursuit of the\r\nancient question of the sources of terrestrial water, the maintenance of\r\nthe levels of seas, etc. Physicians brought instruments to bear on the\r\nquestion of the relationship between weather and the incidence of\r\ndisease. The interrelationship between these various meteorological\r\nenterprises was not long in becoming apparent. Soon after its founding\r\nin 1657 the Florentine academy undertook, through the distribution of\r\nthermometers, barometers, hygrometers, and rain gauges, the\r\nestablishment of an international network of meteorological observation\r\nstations, a network which did not survive the demise of the Accademia\r\nitself ten years later.\r\n\r\nNot for over a century was the first thoroughgoing attempt made at\r\nsystematic observation. There was a meteorological section in the\r\nAcademy of Sciences at Mannheim from 1763, and subsequently a separate\r\nsociety for meteorology. In 1783, the Academy published observations\r\nfrom 39 stations, those from the central station comprising data from\r\nthe hygrometer, wind vane (but not anemometer), rain gauge,\r\nevaporimeter, and apparatus for geomagnetism and atmospheric\r\nelectricity, as well as data from the thermometer and barometer. The\r\nMannheim system was also short-lived, being terminated by the Napoleonic\r\ninvasion, but systems of comparable scope were attempted throughout\r\nEurope and America during the next generation.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the office of the Surgeon General, U. S. Army,\r\nbegan the first systematic observation in 1819, using only the\r\nthermometer and wind vane, to which were added the barometer and\r\nhygrometer in 1840-1841 and the wind force anemometer, rain gauge, and\r\nwet bulb thermometer in 1843. State weather observation systems\r\nmeanwhile had been inaugurated in New York (1825), Pennsylvania (1836),\r\nand Ohio (1842).[4]\r\n\r\nNearly 200 years of observation had not, however, noticeably improved\r\nthe weather, and the naive faith in the power of instruments to reveal\r\nits mysteries, which had possessed many an early meteorologist, no\r\nlonger charmed the scientist of the early 19th century. In the first\r\npublished report of the British Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience in 1833, J. D. Forbes called for a reorganization of procedures:\r\n\r\n     In the science of Astronomy, for example, as in that of Optics, the\r\n     great general truths which emerge in the progress of discovery,\r\n     though depending for their establishment upon a multitude of\r\n     independent facts and observations, possess sufficient unity to\r\n     connect in the mind the bearing of the whole; and the more\r\n     perfectly understood connexion of parts invites to further\r\n     generalization.\r\n\r\n     Very different is the position of an infant science like\r\n     Meteorology. The unity of the whole ... is not always kept in view,\r\n     even as far as our present very limited general conceptions will\r\n     admit of: and as few persons have devoted their whole attention to\r\n     this science alone ... no wonder that we find strewed over its\r\n     irregular and far-spread surface, patches of cultivation upon spots\r\n     chosen without discrimination and treated on no common principle,\r\n     which defy the improver to inclose, and the surveyor to estimate\r\n     and connect them. Meteorological instruments have been for the most\r\n     part treated like toys, and much time and labor have been lost in\r\n     making and recording observations utterly useless for any\r\n     scientific purpose. Even the numerous registers of a rather\r\n     superior class ... hardly contain one jot of information ready for\r\n     incorporation in a Report on the progress of Meteorology....\r\n\r\n     The most general mistake probably consists in the idea that\r\n     Meteorology, as a science, has no other object but an experimental\r\n     acquaintance with the condition of those variable elements which\r\n     from day to day constitute the general and vague result of the\r\n     state of the _weather_ at any given spot; not considering that ...\r\n     when grouped together with others of the same character, [they] may\r\n     afford the most valuable aid to scientific generalization.[5]\r\n\r\nForbes goes on to call for a greater emphasis on theory, and the\r\nreplacement of the many small-scale observatories with \"a few great\r\nRegisters\" to be adequately maintained by \"great Societies\" or by the\r\ngovernment. He suggests that the time for pursuit of theory might be\r\ngained from \"the vague mechanical task to which at present they\r\ngenerally devote their time, namely the search for great numerical\r\naccuracy, to a superfluity of decimal places exceeding the compass of\r\nthe instrument to verify.\"\r\n\r\nFrom its founding the British Association sponsored systematic\r\nobservation at various places. In 1842 it initiated observations at the\r\nKew Observatory, which has continued until today to be the premier\r\nmeteorological observatory in the British Empire. The American scientist\r\nJoseph Henry observed the functioning of an observatory maintained by\r\nthe British Association at Plymouth in 1837, and when he became\r\nSecretary of the new Smithsonian Institution a few years later he made\r\nthe furtherance of meteorology one of its first objectives.\r\n\r\nThe Kew Observatory set a pattern for systematic observation in England\r\nas, from 1855, did the Smithsonian Institution in the United States. The\r\ninstruments used differed little from those in use at Mannheim over half\r\na century earlier[6] (fig. 1). They were undoubtedly more accurate, but\r\nthis should not be overstressed. Forbes had noted in his report of 1832\r\nthat some scientists were then calling for a return to Torricelli, for\r\nthe construction of a temporary barometer on the site in preference to\r\nreliance on the then existing manufactured instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Self-Registering Instruments\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the middle of the 17th century meteorological observations were\r\nrecorded in manuscript books known as \"registers,\" many of which were\r\npublished in the early scientific journals. The most effective\r\nutilization of these observations was in the compilation of the history\r\nof particular storms, but where a larger synthesis was concerned they\r\ntended, as Forbes has shown, to show themselves unsystematic and\r\nnon-comparable. The principal problems of meteorological observation\r\nhave been from the outset the construction of precisely comparable\r\ninstruments and their use to produce comparable records. The former\r\nproblem has been frequently discussed, and perhaps, as Forbes suggests,\r\noveremphasized. It is the latter problem with which we are here\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nThe idea of mechanizing the process of observation, not yet accomplished\r\nin Forbes' time, had been put forward within a little over a decade of\r\nthe first use of the thermometer and barometer in meteorology. On\r\nDecember 9, 1663, Christopher Wren presented the Royal Society with a\r\ndesign for a \"weather clock,\" of which a drawing is extant.[7] This\r\ndrawing (fig. 2) shows an ordinary clock to which is attached a\r\npencil-carrying rack, geared to the hour pinion. A discussion of the\r\nclock's \"reduction to practice\" began the involvement of Robert Hooke,\r\nwho was \"instructed\" in September 1664 to make \"a pendulum clock\r\napplicable to the observing of the changes in the weather.\"[8] This\r\ntribute to Hooke's reputation--and to the versatility of the mechanic\r\narts at this time--was slightly overoptimistic, as 15 years ensued\r\nbefore the clock made its appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--A contemporary drawing of Wren's \"weather\r\nclock.\" (Photo courtesy Royal Society of London.)]\r\n\r\nReferences to this clock are frequent in the records of the Royal\r\nSociety--being mainly periodic injunctions to Hooke to get on with the\r\nwork--until its completion in May 1679. The description which Hooke was\r\nasked to supply was subsequently found among his papers and printed by\r\nWilliam Derham as follows:[9]\r\n\r\n     The weather-clock consists of two parts; _first_, that which\r\n     measures the time, which is a strong and large pendulum-clock,\r\n     which moves a week, with once winding up, and is sufficient to turn\r\n     a cylinder (upon which the paper is rolled) twice round in a day,\r\n     and also to lift a hammer for striking the punches, once every\r\n     quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\n     _Secondly_, of several instruments for measuring the degrees of\r\n     alteration, in the several things, to be observed. The first is,\r\n     the barometer, which moves the first punch, an inch and half,\r\n     serving to shew the difference between the greatest and the least\r\n     pressure of the air. The second is, the thermometer, which moves\r\n     the punch that shews the differences between the greatest heat in\r\n     summer, and the least in winter. The third is, the hygroscope,\r\n     moving the punch, which shews the difference between the moistest\r\n     and driest airs. The fourth is, the rain-bucket, serving to shew\r\n     the quantity of rain that falls; this hath two parts or punches;\r\n     the first, to shew what part of the bucket is fill'd, when there\r\n     falls not enough to make it empty itself; the second, to shew how\r\n     many full buckets have been emptied. The fifth is the wind vane;\r\n     this hath also two parts; the first to shew the strength of the\r\n     wind, which is observed by the number of revolutions in the\r\n     vane-mill, and marked by three punches; the first marks every\r\n     10,000 revolutions, the second every 1,000, and the third every\r\n     100: The second, to shew the quarters of the wind, this hath four\r\n     punches; the first with one point, marking the North quarters, viz.\r\n     N.: N. by E.: N. by W.: NNE.: NNW.: NE. by N. and N.W. by N.: NE.\r\n     and N.W. The second hath two points, marking the East and its\r\n     quarters. The third hath three points, marking the South and its\r\n     quarters. The fourth hath four points, marking the West and its\r\n     quarters. Some of these punches give one mark, every 100\r\n     revolutions of the vane-mill.\r\n\r\n     The stations or places of the first four punches are marked on a\r\n     scrowl of paper, by the clock-hammer, falling every quarter of an\r\n     hour. The punches, belonging to the fifth, are marked on the said\r\n     scrowl, by the revolutions of the vane, which are accounted by a\r\n     small numerator, standing at the top of the clock-case, which is\r\n     moved by the vane-mill.\r\n\r\nWhat, exactly, were the instruments applied by Hooke to his weather\r\nclock? It is not always easy even to guess, because it appears that Wren\r\nwas actually the first to contrive such a device and seems to have\r\ndeveloped nearly as many instruments as Hooke. It might be supposed that\r\nHooke would have adapted to the weather clock his wheel-barometer,\r\nintroduced in 1667, but it also appears that Wren had described (and\r\nperhaps built) a balance barometer before 1667.[10] As to the\r\nthermometer, we have no evidence of original work by Hooke, but we do\r\nhave a description of Wren's self-registering thermometer, a circular,\r\nmercury-filled tube in which changes in temperature move \"the whole\r\ninstrument, like a wheel on its axis.\"[11]\r\n\r\nThe hygroscope (hygrometer) probably existed in more versions than any\r\nother instrument, although we know nothing of any versions by Wren.\r\nHooke may have used his own \"oat-beard\" instrument.[12] Derham follows\r\nhis description of the clock--which has been quoted above--with a\r\ndetailed description of a tipping-bucket rain gauge invented by Hooke\r\nand used with the clock. He also notes that in 1670 Hooke had described\r\ntwo other types of rain gauge in which a bucket was counterbalanced in\r\none case by a string of bullets and in another by an immersed weight.\r\nBut here again, Sprat records the invention of a tipping-bucket gauge by\r\nWren before 1667.\r\n\r\nHooke has been generally regarded as the first inventor of an\r\nanemometer, in 1662.[13] But this invention was a pressure-plate\r\ngauge--that is, a metal plate held with its face against the\r\nwind--whereas the gauge used with the weather clock is clearly a\r\nwindmill type, of which type this may be the first. Wren also had an\r\nanemometer, but we have no description of it. Hooke's account does not\r\nrefer to other instruments which the weather clock is supposed to have\r\nhad, according to a description quoted by Gunther, which concludes the\r\nenumeration of the elements recorded with \"sunshine, etc.\"[14] One can\r\nonly wish for further information on the mechanism by which the\r\npunches--or in Wren's clock, the pencils--were moved. But it is apparent\r\nthat Hooke's clock was actually used for some time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--Dolland's \"atmospheric recorder\": 1, siphon and\r\nfloat barometer; 2, balance (?) thermometer; 3, hygrometer; 4,\r\nelectrometer; 5, float rain gauge; 6, float evaporimeter; 7,\r\nsuspended-weight wind force indicator; 8, wind direction indicator; 9,\r\nclock; 10, receivers for rain gauge and evaporimeter. (From _Official\r\n... Catalogue of the Great Exhibition, 1851,_ London, 1851, pt. 2).]\r\n\r\nThe 17th century was not entirely unprepared for the idea of such a\r\nself-registering instrument. Water clocks and other devices in which\r\nnatural forces governed a pointer were known in antiquity, as were\r\ncounters of the type of the odometer. A water clock described in Italy\r\nin 1524 was essentially an inversion of one of Hooke's rain gauges, that\r\nin which a bucket was balanced against a string of bullets.[15] The\r\nmechanical clock also had a considerable history in the 17th century,\r\nand had long since been applied to the operations of figures through\r\ncams, as was almost certainly the case with the punches in Hooke's\r\nclock. Still, the combination of an instrument-actuated pointer with a\r\nclock-actuated time-scale and a means of obtaining a permanent record\r\nrepresent a group of innovations which certainly ranks among the\r\ngreatest in the history of instrumentation. It appears that we owe these\r\ninnovations to Wren and Hooke.\r\n\r\nHooke's clock contributed nothing to the systematization of\r\nmeteorological observation, and the last record of it appears to have\r\nbeen a note on its \"re-fitting\" in 1690. Its complexity is sufficient\r\nreason for its ephemeral history, but complexity in machine design was\r\nthe fashion of the time and Hooke may have intended no more than a\r\nmechanistic _tour de force_. On the other hand, he may have recognized\r\nthe desideratum to which later meteorologists frequently returned--the\r\nneed for simultaneous observations of several instruments on the same\r\nregister. In any case, no instrument so comprehensive seems to have been\r\nattempted again until the middle of the 19th century, when George\r\nDolland exhibited one at the Great Exhibition in London (see fig. 3).\r\nThe weather elements recorded by Dolland's instrument were the same as\r\nthose recorded by Hooke's, except that atmospheric electricity (unknown\r\nin Hooke's time) was recorded and sunshine was not recorded. Striking\r\nhammers were used by Dolland for some of the instruments and \"ever\r\npointed pencils\" for the others. Dolland's barometer was a wheel\r\ninstrument controlling a hammer. His thermometric element consisted of\r\n12 balanced mercury thermometers. Its mode of operation is not clear,\r\nbut it probably was similar to that of the thermometer developed by Karl\r\nKreil in Prague about the same time (fig. 4). Dolland's wind force\r\nindicator consisted of a pressure plate counterbalanced by a string of\r\nsuspended weights. Altogether, it is not clear that Dolland's instrument\r\nwas superior to Hooke's, or that its career was longer.[16]\r\n\r\nThe 171 years between these two instruments were not lacking in\r\ninventiveness in this field, but even though inventors set the more\r\nmodest aim of a self-recording instrument for a single piece of\r\nmeteorological data, their brain children were uniformly still-born.\r\nThen, during the period 1840-1850, we see the appearance of a series of\r\nself-registering instruments which were actually used, which were widely\r\nadopted by observatories, and which were superseded by superior\r\ninstruments rather than abandoned. This development was undoubtedly a\r\nconsequence of the establishment at that time of permanent observatories\r\nunder competent scientific direction.\r\n\r\nLong experience had demonstrated to the meteorologists of the 1840's\r\nthat the principal obstacle to the success of self-registering\r\ninstruments was friction. Forbes had indicated that the most urgent need\r\nwas for automatic registration of wind data, as the erratic fluctuation\r\nof the wind demanded more frequent observation than any manual system\r\ncould accomplish. Two of the British Association's observers produced\r\nseparate recording instruments for wind direction and force in the late\r\n1830's, a prompt response which suggests that it was not the idea which\r\nwas lacking. One of these instruments--designed by William\r\nWhewell--contained gearing, the friction of which vitiated its utility\r\nas it had that of a number of predecessors. The other, designed by A.\r\nFollet Osler, was free of gearing; it separately recorded wind pressure\r\nand direction on a sheet of paper moved laterally by clockwork. The\r\npressure element was a spring-loaded pressure plate carried around by\r\nthe vane to face the wind. Both this plate and the vane itself were made\r\nto move pencils through linkages of chains and pulleys.[17] Osler's\r\nanemometer (fig. 5) deserves to be called the first successful\r\nself-registering meteorological instrument; it was standard equipment in\r\nBritish observatories until the latter part of the 19th century when it\r\nwas replaced by the cup-anemometer of Robinson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--Kreil's balance thermometer, 1843. (From Karl\r\nKreil, _Magnetische und meteorologische Beobachtungen zu Prag_, Prague,\r\n1843, vol. 3, fig. 1.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--Osler's self-registering pressure plate\r\nanemometer, 1837. The instrument is shown with a tipping-bucket rain\r\ngauge. (From Abbe, _op. cit._ footnote 17.)]\r\n\r\nSelf-recording barometers and thermometers were more vulnerable to the\r\ninfluence of friction than were wind instruments, but fortunately\r\npressure and temperature were also less subject to sudden fluctuation,\r\nand so self-registration was less necessary. Nevertheless, two events\r\noccurred in the 1840's which led to the development of self-registering\r\ninstruments. One event was the development of the geomagnetic\r\nobservatory, which used the magnetometer, an instrument as delicate as\r\nthe barometer and thermometer, and (as it then seemed), as subject to\r\nfluctuation as the wind vane. The other event was the development of\r\nphotography, making possible a recording method free of friction. In\r\n1845 Francis Ronalds at Kew Observatory and Charles Brooke at Greenwich\r\nundertook to develop apparatus to register the magnetometer,\r\nelectrometer, thermometer, and barometer by photography.[18] This was\r\nsix years after Daguerre's discovery of the photographic process. The\r\nmagnetometers of both investigators were put into use in 1847, and the\r\nbarometers and thermometers shortly after. They were based on the\r\ndeflection--by a mirror in the case of the magnetometer and electrometer\r\nand by the mercury in the barometer and thermometer--of a beam of light\r\ndirected against a photographic plate. Brooke exhibited his instruments\r\nat the Great Exhibition of 1850, and they subsequently became items of\r\ncommerce and standard appurtenances of the major observatory until\r\nnearly the end of the century (fig. 6). Their advantages in accuracy\r\nwere finally insufficient to offset the inconvenience to which a\r\nphotographic instrument was subject.\r\n\r\nBefore 1850 the British observatories at Kew and Greenwich (the latter\r\nan astronomical observatory with auxiliary meteorological activity) had\r\nself-registering apparatus in use for most of the elements observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelf-Registering Systems\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the Signal Corps, U.S. Army, took on the burden of official\r\nmeteorology in the United States as the result of a joint resolution of\r\nthe Congress and in accordance with Joseph Henry's dictum that the\r\nSmithsonian Institution should not become the permanent agency for such\r\nscientific work once its permanency had been decided upon. Smithsonian\r\nmeteorology had not involved self-recording instruments, and neither did\r\nthat of the Signal Corps at the outset \"because of the expense of the\r\napparatus, and because nothing of that kind was at that time\r\nmanufactured in this country.\"[19]\r\n\r\nBut almost immediately after 1870 the Signal Corps undertook an\r\nevidently well-financed program for the introduction of\r\nself-registration. \"Complete outfits\" were purchased, representing\r\nWild's system, the Kew system as made by Beckley, Hipp's system (fig.\r\n8), Secci's meteorograph (figs. 9, 10), Draper's system, and Hough's\r\nprinting barograph and thermograph. Of these only the Kew system, the\r\nphotographic system already mentioned, could have been obtained before\r\n1867.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Scale about 1-16th.\r\n\r\n  BAROGRAPH, OR\r\n  SELF-RECORDING MERCURIAL BAROMETER, £68.\r\n\r\nFigure 6.--Photographic registering mercurial barometer, typical\r\ncommercial version. (From J. J. Hicks, _Catalogue of ... Meteorological\r\nInstruments_, London, n.d., about 1870.)]\r\n\r\nLike Kew, Daniel Draper's observatory in Central Park, New York City,\r\nwas established primarily for meteorological observation.[20] Draper was\r\none of the sons of the prominent scientist J. W. Draper. Hipp was an\r\ninstrument-maker of Neuchâtel who specialized in precision clocks.[21]\r\nThe others after whom these \"systems\" were named were directors of\r\nastronomical observatories, which were, at this time, the most active\r\ncenters of meteorological observation. Wild was at the Bern\r\nObservatory,[22] Secci at the Papal Observatory, Rome,[23] and George\r\nHough at the Dudley Observatory, Albany, New York.[24] While the Signal\r\nCorps seems to have acquired all of the principal \"systems,\" some\r\ninteresting instruments were developed at still other observatories,\r\nnotably by Kreil at the astronomical observatory in Prague.[25] The\r\nprincipal impetus for this full-scale mechanization of observation\r\nundoubtedly came from the directors of astronomical observatories.\r\n\r\nThus within little more than the decade of the 1860's were developed\r\nfive new systems of meteorological self-registry that were sufficiently\r\nwell thought of to be adopted or copied by observatories outside their\r\nplaces of origin. Wild and Draper tell us that it was decided when their\r\nrespective observatories were established--in 1860 and 1868--that all\r\ninstruments should be self-registering. Each was obliged to design his\r\nown, being dissatisfied with the photographic registers commercially\r\navailable. The development of these systems would therefore appear to\r\nhave been due, in part, to the general spread of a conviction that\r\nsatisfactory instruments were attainable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nA, is the Vane.\r\n\r\nB, is the Perpendicular Shaft.\r\n\r\nC, is a Horizontal Circular Plate of light material attached to the\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\nE and F, two Rollers communicating motion to the Apron E F from left to\r\nright.\r\n\r\n1, 2, 3, &c., are minute Cards, placed upon the Apron.\r\n\r\nG, is a Clock that regulates the motion of the Roller E, and\r\nconsequently that of the apron and cards.\r\n\r\nD, is a small weight to relieve the Clock.\r\n\r\nN, NE, E, &c., are paper boxes placed upon the circular plate, to\r\nreceive the cards, as they fall from the apron at E.\r\n\r\nFigure 7.--In 1838 the pioneer American meteorologist James H. Coffin\r\n(1806-1873) devised a self-registering wind direction indicator; in 1849\r\nhe improved it as shown here. The band, moved by clockwork, carries\r\ncards marked with the day and hour. In Coffin's earlier instrument, a\r\npart of which is now in the Smithsonian Institution, the vane carried a\r\nfunnel for sand, which ran into a circular row of bottles. (From\r\n_Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience_, 1849, vol. 2, p. 388.)]\r\n\r\nThis confidence was warranted, for the decade of the 1850's had seen the\r\nappearance of major innovations in the basic instruments--thermometer,\r\nbarometer, and wind velocity indicator--that made available instruments\r\nmore adaptable to self-registration. It also saw the development of a\r\nnew method of electrical registration derived from the telegraph. Sir\r\nCharles Wheatstone initiated this small revolution in 1843 when he\r\nreported to the British Association that he had constructed an\r\nelectromagnetic meteorological register which \"records the indications\r\nof the barometer, thermometer and the psychrometer [meaning wet-bulb\r\nthermometer] every half hour ... and prints the results on a sheet of\r\npaper in figures,\" running a week unattended. The working of this\r\nregister involved the insertion of a conductor in the tubes to make a\r\ncircuit, the thermometers having open tops.[26] This was ten years after\r\nthe development of the electromagnetic relay and six years after\r\nWheatstone's introduction of his own telegraph.\r\n\r\nWheatstone's instrument left a very ephemeral record in the\r\nmeteorological literature, and appears to have been defective or out of\r\nfashion with its time, which was concerned with the introduction of\r\nphotographic instruments. Wheatstone's work was rediscovered, along with\r\nthat of several other much earlier inventors, by the determined\r\nobservatory directors of the 1860's.\r\n\r\nOf the five systems developed at that time, four used electromagnetic\r\nregistration, only Draper adhering to a mechanical system (see fig. 11).\r\nFor temperature measurement Secci and Hough used Wheatstone's electrical\r\nsystem with a mercurial thermometer (fig. 12), but the other four\r\nutilized a physical principle which had been proposed periodically for\r\nat least a century--the unequal thermal expansion of a bimetallic strip.\r\nThis principle had been utilized by watchmakers for a quite different\r\npurpose--the temperature compensation of the watch pendulum--but its\r\npossibilities as a thermometer had been known long before the mid-19th\r\ncentury.[27]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--Hipp's registering aneroid barometer, with a\r\ntelegraphic printer. (_USNM 314544; Smithsonian photo 46740-D._)]\r\n\r\nFor the measurement of pressure, Secci, Wild, and Draper adopted, or\r\nrediscovered, the balance barometer devised by Wren in the 17th century.\r\nIn this type of instrument (see figs. 13, 15) either the tube or the\r\nreservoir of the barometer is attached to one arm of a balance, the\r\nequilibrium of which is disturbed by the movement of the mercury in the\r\ninstrument.[28]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9.--Front and rear views of Secci's meteorograph,\r\n1867. (From Lacroix, _op. cit._ footnote 22.)]\r\n\r\nHough's barometer was an adaptation of the electrical contact\r\nthermometer. The movement of the mercury over a certain minute distance\r\nwithin the tube served as a switch to energize an electrical recording\r\nsystem. Hipp, who was perhaps the latest of this group, first applied\r\nthe aneroid barometer (fig. 8) to self-registration. The idea of the\r\naneroid--an air-tight bellows against which the atmospheric pressure\r\nwould act--had been advanced by Leibniz in the 17th century and had been\r\nthe subject of a few abortive experiments in the 18th century. Not until\r\n1848 was an instrument produced that was acceptable to users of the\r\nbarometer.[29]\r\n\r\nAs a wind velocity instrument all six systems used the cup-anemometer\r\ndeveloped by Robinson in 1846, an instrument whose chief virtue was the\r\ncare which its inventor had taken to work out the relationship between\r\nits movement and the actual velocity of the wind.[30] Beckley and Draper\r\ncaused it to move a pencil through gearing; the others used with it\r\nelectromagnetic counters actuated by rotating contacts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--Chart from Secci's meteorograph. (From\r\nLacroix, _op. cit._ footnote 22.)]\r\n\r\nAs has been indicated, the Signal Corps used all six systems, a panoply\r\nof gadgetry which must have been wondrous to behold. Its Secci\r\nmeteorograph, which had attracted much attention at Paris, was estimated\r\nto have cost 15,000 francs. Abbe reported in 1894 that the instruments\r\nwere long kept in the apparatus room \"as a fascinating show to visitors\r\nand a stimulation to the staff in the invention of other\r\ninstruments.\"[31]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--Draper's mechanical registering barometer,\r\nas used in the Lick Observatory.

Wren probably was the originator of this type of\r\ninstrument. (From Loewenherz, _op. cit._ footnote 28.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--Marvin's mechanical registering barometer,\r\n1905. This instrument was formerly in the U.S. Weather Bureau. (_USNM\r\n316500_; _Smithsonian photo 46740-E_.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--\"Steelyard barometer\" as shown in Charles\r\nHutton's _Mathematical and Philosophical Dictionary_ (London, 1796, vol.\r\n1, p. 188). Hutton makes no reference to the originator of this\r\ninstrument; he attributes the \"Diagonal\" (or inclined) barometer to\r\nSamuel Morland.]\r\n\r\nFrom 1875 the question was no longer one of the introduction of\r\nself-registering instruments to major observatories but their complete\r\nmechanization and the extension of registration to substations. Having\r\naccepted self-registration, meteorologists turned their attention to the\r\nsimplification of instruments. In 1904 Charles Marvin, of what is now\r\nthe U.S. Weather Bureau, brought the self-registering barometer into\r\nsomething of a full circle by producing an instrument (fig. 14) that was\r\nnothing more than Hooke's wheel barometer directly adapted to\r\nrecording.[32] But this process of simplification had been accomplished\r\nat a stroke, about 1880, with the introduction by the Parisian\r\ninstrument-maker Jules Richard of a self-registering barometer and a\r\nthermometer combining the simplest form of instrument with the simplest\r\nform of registration (see fig. 16). This innovation, which fixed the\r\nform of the conventional registering instrument until the advent of the\r\nradiosonde, seems to have stemmed from a source quite outside\r\nmeteorology--the technology of the steam gauge. Richard's thermometric\r\nelement was the curved metal tube of elliptical cross-section that\r\nBourdon had developed several decades earlier as a steam gauge. Pressure\r\nwithin such a tube causes it to straighten, and thus to move a pointer\r\nattached to one end. Bourdon had opened it to the steam source. Richard\r\nfilled it with alcohol, closed it, and found that the expansion of the\r\nalcohol on heating caused a similar straightening. His barometric\r\nelement was a type of aneroid, which Hipp had already used but which\r\nRichard may have also adopted from a type of steam gauge. For a\r\nrecording mechanism, Richard was able to use a simple direct lever\r\nconnection, as the forces involved in his instruments, being\r\nconcentrated, were not greatly hampered by friction.[33] By 1900 these\r\nsimple and inexpensive instruments had relegated to the scrap pile,\r\nunfortunately literally, the elegant products of the mass attack of\r\nobservatory directors in the 1860's on the problem of the\r\nself-registering thermometer and barometer.[34]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the rarity of special studies on the history of\r\nmeteorological instruments, it is impossible to claim that this brief\r\nreview has neglected no important instruments, and conclusions as to the\r\nlineage of the late 19th century instruments can only be tentatively\r\ndrawn. The conclusion is inescapable, however, that the majority of the\r\ninstruments upon which the self-registering systems of the late 19th\r\ncentury were based had been proposed and, in most cases, actually\r\nconstructed in the 17th century. It is also evident that in the 17th\r\ncentury at least one attempt was made at a system as comprehensive as\r\nany accomplished in the 19th century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--Richard's registering aneroid barometer, an\r\ninstrument used at the U.S. Weather Bureau about 1888. The Richard\r\nregistering thermometer is similar, the aneroid being replaced by an\r\nalcohol-filled Bourdon tube. (_USNM 252981; Smithsonian photo\r\n46740-C_.)]\r\n\r\nTo attribute the success of self-registering instruments in the late\r\n19th century to the unquestionable improvements in the techniques of the\r\ninstrument-maker is to beg the question, for it is by no means clear\r\nthat the techniques of the 17th-century instrument-maker were unequal to\r\nthe task. It should also be noted that the photographic and\r\nelectromagnetic systems of the 19th century seem to have been something\r\nof an interlude, for some of the latest and most durable (all of\r\nDraper's and Richard's instruments and Marvin's barograph) were purely\r\nmechanical instruments, as had been those of Hooke and Wren. If we\r\nconclude that the 19th-century instruments were more accurate, we should\r\nalso recall Forbes' comments upon the question of instrumental accuracy.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the essential difference between the 17th and 19th\r\ncenturies that made possible the development of the self-registering\r\nobservatory? It would appear to have been a difference of degree--the\r\nmaturation in the 19th century of certain features of the 17th. The\r\nmost important of these features were the spread throughout the western\r\nworld of the spirit that had animated the scientific societies of\r\nFlorence and London, the continued popularity of the astronomical\r\nobservatory as an object of the philanthropy of an affluent society, and\r\nthe continued existence of the nonspecialized scientist. Under these\r\ncircumstances such nonmeteorologists as Wheatstone, Henry, Hough, Wild,\r\nand Secci had the temerity to range over the whole of the not yet\r\ncompartmented branches of science and technology, fully confident that\r\nthey were capable of finding thereby a solution to any problem important\r\nenough to warrant their attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] On early meteorological instruments see A.

As to the actual completion\r\nof the clock, the president of the Society visited \"Mr. Hooke's turret\"\r\nto see it in January of 1678/79 but it was not reported \"ready to be\r\nshown\" until the following May (Gunther, pp. 506, 518).\r\n\r\n[10] Wren's clock and its wind vane and anemometer, thermometer,\r\nbarometer, and rain gauge are described by T.

I have found no other\r\nreference to this instrument. Considerable attention was given to the\r\nthermometer, however, for Wheatstone proposed to send it aloft in a\r\nballoon for the measurement of temperatures at high altitudes. A small\r\nclock caused a vertical rack to ascend and descend once in six minutes.\r\nThe rack carried a platinum wire which moved within the thermometer over\r\n28 degrees. From a galvanic battery and a galvanometer on the ground two\r\ninsulated copper wires were to extend to the balloon, one connected to\r\nthe mercury and the other to the clock frame. The deflection of the\r\ngalvanometer was to be timed with a second clock on the ground.\r\n(Professor Wheatstone, \"Report on the Electro-Magnetic Meteorological\r\nRegister,\" _Mechanics' Magazine_, London, 1843, vol. 39, p. 204).\r\n\r\n[27] In 1662 Hooke had proposed the use of a bimetallic pendulum for the\r\ntemperature compensation of clocks. Thermometers on this principle were\r\ndescribed to the Royal Society in 1748 and in 1760 (_Philosophical\r\nTransactions of the Royal Society of London_, 1748, vol. 45, p. 128;\r\n1760, vol. 51, p. 823). Some systems used a bimetallic thermometer in\r\nthe sun and a mercurial instrument in the shade.\r\n\r\n[28] This instrument has been persistently associated with Sir Samuel\r\nMorland (1625-1695). For example, A. Sprung of the Deutsche Seewarte\r\ndescribed his own balance-barometer as a \"Wagebarograph nach Samuel\r\nMorland\" (in L. Loewenherz, _Bericht über die wissenschaftlichen\r\nInstrumente auf der Berliner Gewerbeausstellung im Jahre 1879_, Berlin,\r\n1880, p. 230ff). Sprat (_op. cit._ footnote 10, p. 313) reported that\r\nWren had proposed \"balances to shew the weight of the air by their\r\nspontaneous inclination.\" This must, therefore, be Wren's invention,\r\nunless he got it from Morland, who does not seem to have published\r\nanything about the barometer but only to have described some ideas to a\r\nfriend. But Morland's was probably the _inclined_ and not the _balance_\r\nbarometer. (See under \"barometer\" in Charles Hutton, _Mathematical and\r\nPhilosophical Dictionary_, London, 1796, vol. 1; also J. K. Fischer,\r\n_Physikalisches Wörterbuch, Göttingen_, 1798).\r\n\r\n[29] Leibniz, in several letters--beginning with one to Denys Papin on\r\nJune 21, 1697--proposed the making of a barometer on the model of a\r\nbellows. Of subsequent versions of such a barometer, that of Vidi\r\n(described by Poggendorff, _Annalen der Physik und Chemie_, 1848, Band\r\n73, p. 620) is generally regarded as the first practical aneroid (see\r\nalso Gerland and Traumüller, _op. cit._ footnote 1, pp. 239, 323).\r\n\r\n[30] T. R. Robinson, \"Modification of Dr. Whewell's Anemometer for\r\nMeasuring the Velocity of the Wind,\" _Report of the 16th Meeting of the\r\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science, 1846_, 1847, pt. 2,\r\np. 111.\r\n\r\n[31] Abbe, _op. cit._ (footnote 19), pp. 263-264.\r\n\r\n[32] Because of its superior accuracy to the aneroid barograph, Marvin's\r\nbarometer was in use through the 1940's. See R. N. Covert,\r\n\"Meteorological Instruments and Apparatus Employed by the United States\r\nWeather Bureau,\" _Journal of the Optical Society of America_, 1925, vol.\r\n10, p. 322.\r\n\r\n[33] Both of Richard's instruments (described in _Bulletin Mensuel de la\r\nSociété d'Encouragement pour l'Industrie Nationale_, November 1882, ser.\r\n3, vol. 9, pp. 531-543) were in use at Kew by 1885 and at the U.S.\r\nWeather Bureau by 1888. The firm of Richard Freres claimed in 1889 to\r\nhave made 7,000 registering instruments, of which the majority were\r\nprobably thermographs and barographs. At that time, certainly no other\r\nmaker had made more than a small fraction of this number of\r\nself-registering instruments. The origin of Richard's thermograph seems\r\nto have been the \"elastic manometer\" described by E. Bourdon in 1851\r\n(_Bulletin de la Société d'Encouragement pour l'Industrie Nationale_,\r\n1851, no. 562, p. 197). While attempting to restore a flattened\r\nstill-pipe, Bourdon had discovered the property of tubes to change shape\r\nunder fluid pressure. The instrument he developed in consequence became\r\nthe standard steam pressure gauge.\r\n\r\n[34] A few of these instruments, such as the Marvin barograph, survived\r\nfor some time because of their superior accuracy. Even as museum pieces,\r\nonly a few exist today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE, 1961.\r\n\r\nFor sale by the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing\r\nOffice, Washington 25, D.C. - Price 25 cents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note:\r\n\r\n\r\nMinor errors in punctuation have been corrected without note.
