The story of his wonderful success with this\r\ndifficult instrument is familiar to all readers of astronomical\r\nliterature: this form of telescope was in effect born again; and his\r\ncontributions to our knowledge of the nebulae were epoch-making.\r\n\r\nProfessor Keeler's observing programme included one hundred and four\r\nsubjects. At the time of his lamented death, on August 12, 1900,\r\nsatisfactory negatives of two-thirds of the selected objects had been\r\nsecured. The unphotographed objects were mainly those which come into\r\nobserving position in the unfavorable winter and spring months. The\r\ncompletion of the programme was entrusted to Assistant Astronomer Perrine.\r\nThe observers were assisted chiefly by Mr. H. K. Palmer, and in smaller\r\ndegree by Messrs. Joel Stebbins, C. G. Dall, R. H. Curtiss and Sebastian\r\nAlbrecht.\r\n\r\nProfessor Keeler's photographs enabled him to make two discoveries of\r\nprime importance, not to mention several that are scarcely secondary to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n1st.--\"Many thousands of unrecorded nebulae exist in the sky. A\r\nconservative estimate places the number within reach of the Crossley\r\nreflector at about 120,000. The number of nebulae in our catalogues is but\r\na small fraction of this.\" [The number already discovered and catalogued\r\ndid not exceed 13,000. Later observations with the Crossley reflector,\r\nwith longer exposure-times and more sensitive plates, render it probable\r\nthat the number of nebulae discoverable with this powerful instrument is of\r\nthe order of half a million.]\r\n\r\n2d.--\"Most of these nebulae have a spiral structure.\"\r\n\r\nThe photographs of the one hundred and four subjects contain the images of\r\n744 nebulae not previously observed. A catalogue of these is published in\r\nthe present volume. Their positions, which are thought to be accurate\r\nwithin 1'', were determined by Messrs. Palmer, Curtiss, and Albrecht.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this volume is to reproduce and make available for\r\nstudy, the larger and more interesting nebulae and clusters on the\r\nprogramme, sixty-eight in number. The thirty-six subjects not reproduced\r\nare for the most part small or apparently not of special interest. The\r\ndifficulties attending the reproduction of astronomical photographs by\r\nmechanical processes are well-known to all who have made the attempt. It\r\nseems necessary to recognize, at least at present, that delicate details\r\nof structure will be lost, and that contrasts between very bright and very\r\nfaint regions will be changed, especially if a good sky background is\r\npreserved; in other words, that the best obtainable reproductions fall far\r\nshort of doing justice to the original photographs. Technical studies\r\nshould be based upon the original negatives or upon copies on glass.\r\n\r\nAfter considerable experimental work, involving several methods and\r\nseveral firms, the making of the heliogravure plates and the hand-press\r\nprints was entrusted to The Photogravure and Color Company of New York\r\nCity. To this firm's continued interest and willingness to act on\r\nconstructive criticism is due much of the excellence of the results.\r\n\r\nThe expensive reproductions could hardly have been undertaken without the\r\ngenerous assistance of the donors mentioned on a preceding page.\r\n\r\nProfessor Keeler's description of the Crossley reflector, of his methods\r\nof observing, and of the chief results obtained, was written only a short\r\ntime before his death. It is here republished. Other results of his work\r\nare described in the several papers to which the footnotes refer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Orion Nebula,                                         _Frontispiece_\r\n\r\n  The Crossley Reflector of the Lick Observatory,                  Page 11\r\n\r\n  List of Nebulae and Clusters Photographed,                          \"  30\r\n\r\n  Catalogue of New Nebulae Discovered on the Negatives,               \"  31\r\n\r\n  Positions of Known Nebulae Determined from the Crossley Negatives,  \"  42\r\n\r\n  List of Illustrations,                                             \"  45\r\n\r\n  Illustrations,                                          following  \"  46\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CROSSLEY REFLECTOR OF THE LICK OBSERVATORY.[1]\r\n\r\nBy JAMES E. KEELER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crossley reflector, at present the largest instrument of its class in\r\nAmerica, was made in 1879 by Dr. A. A. Common, of London, in order to\r\ncarry out, and test by practical observation, certain ideas of his\r\nrespecting the design of large reflecting telescopes. For the construction\r\nof the instrument embodying these ideas, and for some fine astronomical\r\nphotographs obtained with it, Dr. Common was awarded the gold medal of the\r\nRoyal Astronomical Society in 1884.\r\n\r\nIn 1885, Dr. Common, wishing to make a larger telescope on a somewhat\r\nsimilar plan, sold the instrument to Edward Crossley, Esq., F. R. A. S.,\r\nof Halifax, England. Mr. Crossley provided the telescope with a dome of\r\nthe usual form, in place of the sliding roof used by its former owner, and\r\nmade observations with it for some years; but the climate of Halifax not\r\nbeing suitable for the best use of such a telescope, he consented, at the\r\nrequest of Dr. Holden, then Director of the Lick Observatory, to present\r\nit to this institution. The funds for transporting the telescope and dome\r\nto California, and setting them up on Mount Hamilton, were subscribed by\r\nfriends of the Lick Observatory, for the most part citizens of California.\r\nThe work was completed, and the telescope housed in a suitable observatory\r\nbuilding, in 1895.[2]\r\n\r\nOn taking charge of the Lick Observatory in 1898, I decided to devote my\r\nown observing time to the Crossley reflector, although the whole of my\r\nprevious experience had been with refracting telescopes. I was more\r\nparticularly desirous of testing the reflector with my own hands, because\r\nsuch preliminary trials of it as had been made had given rise to somewhat\r\nconflicting opinions as to its merits.[3] The result of my experience is\r\ngiven in the following article, which is written chiefly with reference to\r\nAmerican readers. If I have taken occasion to point out what I regard as\r\ndefects in the design or construction of the instrument, I have done so,\r\nnot from any desire to look a gift horse in the mouth, but in the interest\r\nof future improvement, and to make intelligible the circumstances under\r\nwhich the work of the reflector is now being done and will be done\r\nhereafter. The most important improvements which have suggested themselves\r\nhave indeed already been made by Dr. Common himself, in constructing his\r\nfive-foot telescope. The three-foot reflector is, in spite of numerous\r\nidiosyncracies which make its management very different from the\r\ncomparatively simple manipulation of a refractor, by far the most\r\neffective instrument in the Observatory for certain classes of\r\nastronomical work. Certainly no one has more reason than I to appreciate\r\nthe great value of Mr. Crossley's generous gift.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOME OF THE CROSSLEY REFLECTOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crossley dome is about 350 yards from the main Observatory, at the end\r\nof a long rocky spur which extends from the Observatory summit toward the\r\nsouth, and on which are two of the houses occupied by members of the\r\nObservatory staff. It is below the level of the lowest reservoir,\r\n\"Huyghens,\" which receives the discharge from the hydraulic machinery of\r\nthe 36-inch refractor, and therefore the water engine furnished by Mr.\r\nCrossley for turning the dome can not be used, unless a new water\r\nsystem--overflow reservoir, pump and windmill--is provided. In this\r\nrespect a better site would have been a point on the south slope of\r\n\"Kepler,\"--the middle peak of Mount Hamilton--just above the Huyghens\r\nreservoir. No addition to the present water system would then have been\r\nneeded. The slope of the mountain at this place might cut off the view of\r\nthe north horizon, but since the telescope can not be turned below the\r\npole, this would be a matter of no consequence. Water-power for the dome\r\nis not, however, really necessary.\r\n\r\nThe cylindrical walls of the dome, 36-1/4 feet inside diameter, are\r\ndouble, and provided with ventilators. Opening into the dome, on the left\r\nof the entrance, are three small rooms, one of which has been fitted up as\r\na photographic dark room, and another, containing a sidereal clock and a\r\ntelephone, which communicates with the main Observatory, as a study, while\r\nthe third is used for tools and storage. There is also a small room for\r\nthe water engine, in case it should be used. The dome is at present\r\nsupplied with water from only the middle reservoir, Kepler, which is\r\nreserved for domestic purposes and is not allowed to pass through the\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nThe dome itself, 38 feet 9 inches in diameter, is made of sheet-iron\r\nplates riveted to iron girders. It also carries the wooden gallery,\r\nladders, and observing platform, which are suspended from it by iron rods.\r\nThe apparatus for turning the dome consists of a cast-iron circular rack\r\nbolted to the lower side of the sole-plate, and a set of gears terminating\r\nin a sprocket-wheel, from which hangs an endless rope. As the dome does\r\nnot turn easily, it has been necessary to multiply the gearing of the\r\nmechanism so that one arm's-length pull on the rope moves the dome only\r\nabout one inch. In some positions of the telescope the dome can not be\r\nmoved more than six or eight inches at a time without danger of striking\r\nthe tube, and this slowness of motion is then not disadvantageous. It is\r\nonly when the dome has to be moved through a considerable angle, as in\r\nturning to a fresh object, or in photographing some object which passes\r\nnearly through the zenith, that the need for a mechanical means of\r\nrotation is felt.\r\n\r\nThe observing slit, 6 feet wide, extends considerably beyond the zenith.\r\nIt is closed by a double shutter, which is operated by an endless rope.\r\nThe upper part, within the dome, is also closed by a hood, or shield,\r\nwhich serves to protect the telescope from any water that may find its way\r\nthrough the shutter, and which is rolled back to the north when\r\nobservations are made near the zenith. I have recently fitted the lower\r\nhalf of the slit with a wind-screen, which has proved to be a most useful\r\naddition. It is made of tarpaulin, attached to slats which slide between\r\nthe two main girders, and is raised or lowered by halliards, which belay\r\nto cleats on the north rail of the gallery. A more detailed description of\r\nthe dome has been given in an article by Mr. Crossley,[4] from which the\r\nreduced figure in Fig. 1[5] has been taken.\r\n\r\nThe mounting of the three-foot reflector has been very completely\r\ndescribed and illustrated by Dr. Common,[6] so that only a very general\r\ndescription need be given here. The most important feature of the\r\nmounting is that the telescope tube, instead of being on one side of the\r\npolar axis, as in the usual construction, is central, so that the axis of\r\nthe mirror and the polar axis are in the same line when the telescope is\r\ndirected to the pole. The declination axis is short, and is supported by a\r\nmassive goose-neck bolted to the upper end of the polar axis. The mirror\r\nis placed just _above_ the declination axis. Its weight, and the weight of\r\nthe whole tube and eye-end, are counterpoised by slabs of lead, placed in\r\ntwo iron boxes, between which the goose-neck of the polar axis passes. The\r\ngreat advantage of this arrangement, and the controlling principle of the\r\ndesign, is that the telescope is perfectly free to pass the meridian at\r\nall zenith distances. No reversal of the instrument is needed, or is\r\nindeed possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CROSSLEY REFLECTOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor long-exposure photography, the advantage above referred to is obvious,\r\nbut it is attended by certain disadvantages. One of these is that a very\r\nmuch larger dome is required than for the usual form of mounting. Another\r\nis the great amount of dead weight which the axes must carry; for the\r\nmirror, instead of helping to counterpoise the upper end of the tube, must\r\nitself be counterpoised. When anything is attached to the eye-end (and in\r\nastrophysical work one is always attaching things to the eye-end of a\r\ntelescope), from ten to twenty times as much weight must be placed in the\r\ncounterpoise boxes below the declination axis. Where room is to be found\r\nfor the weights required to counterpoise the Bruce spectrograph, is a\r\nproblem which I have not yet succeeded in solving.\r\n\r\nIn his five-foot reflector, Dr. Common has caused the telescope tube to\r\nswing between two large ears, which project from the upper end of the\r\nboiler-like polar axis, the pivots constituting the declination axis being\r\nnear, but above, the lower end of the tube. The mirror, therefore, helps\r\nto counterpoise the upper end of the tube. This I regard as a distinct\r\nimprovement. The danger of large masses of metal near the mirror injuring\r\nthe definition is, in my opinion, imaginary; at least there is no such\r\ndanger on Mount Hamilton, where the temperature variations are unusually\r\nsmall. Experience with the Crossley reflector, as well as with the other\r\ninstruments of the Lick Observatory, shows that the definition depends\r\nalmost entirely on external conditions.\r\n\r\nMy first trials of the reflector, as first mounted at the Lick\r\nObservatory, showed that the center of motion was inconveniently high.\r\nAmong other difficulties arising from this circumstance, the spectroscope\r\nprojected beyond the top of the dome, so that it had to be removed before\r\nthe shutter could be closed. In July, 1898, the pier was therefore cut\r\ndown two feet. This brought the eye-end down nearly to the level of the\r\ngallery rail, where it was at a convenient height for the observer when\r\nsitting on a camp-stool, and it made all parts of the mounting more\r\naccessible. Toward the north and south, the range of the telescope, being\r\nlimited in these directions by the construction of the mounting, was not\r\naffected by the change, but the telescope can not now be used at such low\r\naltitudes as formerly, near the east and west points of the horizon. The\r\nonly occasion likely to call for the use of the reflector in these\r\npositions is the appearance of a large comet near the Sun, and, after some\r\nconsideration, I decided to sacrifice these chances for the sake of\r\nincreasing the general usefulness of the instrument. Except in rare cases,\r\nall observations are made within three hours of the meridian.\r\n\r\nTo adapt the mounting to the latitude of Mount Hamilton, a wedge-shaped\r\ncasting, shown in the illustration, had been provided, but through some\r\nerror, arising probably from the fact that the telescope had been used in\r\ntwo different latitudes in England, the angle of the casting was too\r\ngreat. When the pier was cut down its upper surface was therefore sloped\r\ntoward the south, in order to compensate the error in the casting. Plate\r\nVII shows the instrument very nearly as it is at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe polar axis of the Crossley reflector is a long, hollow cylinder,\r\nseparated by a space of about one-eighth of an inch from its concentric\r\ncasing. The idea was to fill this space with mercury, and float the\r\ngreater part of the thrust of the axis, the function of a small steel pin\r\nat the lower end being merely to steady the axis. But this mercury\r\nflotation, as applied to the Crossley telescope, is a delusion, as I think\r\nMr. Crossley had already found. The mercury, it is true, relieves the\r\nthrust to some extent, but it greatly increases the already enormous side\r\npressure on the steel pin at the bottom, thus creating a much greater evil\r\nthan the one it is intended to remedy. The workmen who set up the mounting\r\ninform me that the small bearing at the lower end of the polar axis is\r\nbadly worn, as I should expect it to be. Instead of putting mercury into\r\nthe space intended for it, I have therefore poured in a pint or so of oil,\r\nto keep the lower bearing lubricated. For the reasons indicated above, the\r\nforce required to move the telescope in right ascension is perhaps five\r\ntimes greater than it should be. The lower end of the polar axis ought to\r\nbe fitted with ball bearings to take the thrust, and with a pair of\r\nfriction wheels on top; but it would be difficult to make these changes\r\nnow. It should be observed that the disadvantages of the mercury flotation\r\nare considerably greater at Mount Hamilton than at the latitude for which\r\nthe telescope was designed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CROSSLEY REFLECTOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs already stated above, the range of the telescope is limited on the\r\nsouth by the construction of the mounting. The greatest southern\r\ndeclination which can be observed is 25 deg.. In England this would doubtless\r\nmark the limit set by atmospheric conditions, but at Mount Hamilton it\r\nwould be easy to photograph objects 15 deg. farther south, if the telescope\r\ncould be pointed to them.\r\n\r\nThe original driving-clock having proved to be inefficient, at least\r\nwithout an electric control, a new and powerful driving-clock was made by\r\nthe Observatory instrument maker, from designs by Professor Hussey. In its\r\ngeneral plan it is like that of the 36-inch refractor. The winding\r\napparatus, contained in the large casting of the original mounting, has no\r\nmaintaining power, and can not easily be fitted with one. The clock could\r\nin no case be wound during a photographic exposure, on account of the\r\ntremors attending the operation, but it would be somewhat more convenient\r\nto have the stars remain on the plate during the winding. With a little\r\npractice, however, one can wind the clock without actually stopping it,\r\nthough the object must afterwards be brought back to its place by means of\r\nthe slow motion in right ascension.\r\n\r\nTwo finders have recently been fitted to the Crossley reflector. One has\r\nan object-glass of four inches aperture and eight feet six inches focal\r\nlength, with a field of about 1 deg. 2', which is very nearly the photographic\r\nfield of the main telescope. Its standards are bolted to one of the corner\r\ntubes of the reflector. The other finder has a three-inch objective and a\r\nlarge field. It had not been mounted when the photograph for the plate was\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nWhen a telescope is used for photographing objects near the pole, with\r\nlong exposures, the polar axis must be quite accurately adjusted, for\r\notherwise the centers of motion of the stars and of the telescope will not\r\nagree, and the star images will be distorted. It is true that with a\r\ndouble-slide plate-holder, like the one used with the Crossley reflector,\r\none star--namely, the guiding star--is forced to remain in a fixed\r\nposition with respect to the plate; but the differential motion of the\r\nother stars causes them to describe short arcs, or trails, around this\r\nstar as a center. A considerable part of the spring of 1899 was spent in\r\nefforts to perfect the adjustment of the polar axis, an operation which,\r\non account of the peculiar form of the mounting, offers unusual\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nIn the first plan which was tried, the reflector was used as a transit\r\ninstrument. The inclination of the declination axis was determined with a\r\nhanging level which had been provided by Mr. Crossley, the hour circle and\r\npolar axis being very firmly clamped. The clock correction being known\r\nfrom the records kept at the Observatory, the collimation and azimuth\r\nconstants were found by the usual formulae. This method failed to give\r\nsatisfactory results, and it was found later that the declination and\r\npolar axis were not exactly at right angles.\r\n\r\nThere is only one part of the sky on which the telescope can be reversed;\r\nnamely, the pole. A method which promised well, and on which some time was\r\nspent, consists in photographing the pole (the declination axis being\r\nhorizontal) by allowing the stars near it to trail for ten or fifteen\r\nminutes, then turning the polar axis 180 deg. and photographing the pole again\r\non the same plate. Half the distance between the images gives the error of\r\nthe polar axis, which, if the plate is properly oriented, is easily\r\nresolved into horizontal and vertical components; while the distance of\r\neach image from the center of the plate is this error increased or\r\ndiminished by twice the deviation of the telescope axis. In this case the\r\nvertical component depends upon the reading of the declination circle, and\r\nthe horizontal component gives the error of collimation. This method\r\nfailed, however, to give consistent results, mainly on account of\r\ninstability of the mirror, and was abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe use of the large mirror for purposes of adjustment was finally given\r\nup, and the axis was adjusted by observations of _Polaris_ with the long\r\nfinder, in the usual manner. In order to reach the star at lower\r\nculmination the finder tube had to be thrown out of parallelism with the\r\nmain telescope.\r\n\r\nThe base-plate having no definite center of rotation in azimuth, and the\r\nwedges and crowbars used for moving it being uncertain in their action, a\r\nwatch telescope, provided with a micrometer eyepiece, was firmly secured\r\nto the mounting throughout these operations, in such manner that a mark on\r\nthe southern horizon could be observed through one of the windows of the\r\ndome. The errors of the polar axis were finally reduced to within the\r\nlimits of error of observation.\r\n\r\nThe movable hour circle and driving wheel of the Crossley reflector has\r\ntwo sets of graduations. The driving screw having been thrown out of gear,\r\nthe circle is turned until the outer vernier indicates the sidereal time,\r\nwhereupon the driving screw is thrown into gear again. The inner vernier\r\nis then set to the right ascension of the object which it is desired to\r\nobserve. As an inconsistency, of minor importance, in the design of the\r\nmounting, I may note that the slow motion in right ascension changes the\r\nreading of the outer vernier instead of that of the inner one. In\r\npractice, however, no inconvenience is caused by this construction.\r\n\r\nIn the early experiments and photographic work with the Crossley\r\ntelescope, irregularities in driving were a source of great annoyance. Dr.\r\nRoberts, in laying down the conditions which should be fulfilled by a good\r\nphotographic telescope, says that a star should remain bisected by a\r\nthread in the eyepiece for two minutes at a time. The Crossley telescope\r\nwas so far from fulfilling this condition that a star would not keep its\r\nplace for two consecutive seconds; and the greatest alertness on the part\r\nof the observer did not suffice to ensure round star images on a\r\nphotographic plate. It was obvious that the fault did not lie with the\r\ndriving clock; in fact, many of the sudden jumps in right ascension, if\r\nexplained in this way, would have required the clock to run backward;\r\nnevertheless the clock was tested by causing its revolutions to be\r\nrecorded on a chronograph at the main Observatory, together with the beats\r\nof one of the standard clocks. For this purpose a break-circuit attachment\r\nwas made by Mr. Palmer. The errors of the clock were in this way found to\r\nbe quite small.\r\n\r\nThe principal source of the irregularities was found in the concealed\r\nupper differential wheel of the Grubb slow motion. This wheel turned with\r\nuncertain friction, sometimes rotating on its axis, and sometimes\r\nremaining at rest. After it was checked the driving was much better, and\r\nwas still farther improved by repairing some defective parts of the train.\r\nSmall irregularities still remain. They seem to be partly due to\r\ninaccuracies in the cutting of the gears, or of the teeth of the large\r\ndriving wheel, and partly to the springing of the various parts, due to\r\nthe very considerable friction of the polar axis in its bearings. The\r\nremaining irregularities are so small, however, that they are easily\r\ncorrected by the screws of the sliding plate-holder, and with reasonable\r\nattention on the part of the observer, round star images are obtained with\r\nexposures of four hours' duration.\r\n\r\nThe large mirror, the most important part of the telescope, has an\r\naperture of three feet, and a focal length of 17 feet 6.1 inches. It was\r\nmade by Mr. Calver. Its figure is excellent. On cutting off the cone of\r\nrays from a star, by a knife-edge at the focus, according to the method of\r\nFoucault, the illumination of the mirror is very uniform, while the star\r\ndisks as seen in an ordinary eyepiece are small and almost perfectly\r\nround. They are not, I think, quite so good as the images seen with a\r\nlarge refractor; still, they are very good indeed, as the following\r\nobservations of double stars, made recently for this purpose, will show.\r\n\r\nSeveral close double stars were examined on the night of April 17, 1900,\r\nwith a power of 620. The seeing was four on a scale of five. The\r\nmagnitudes and distances of the components, as given in the table, are\r\nfrom recent observations by Professor Hussey with the 36-inch refractor.\r\n\r\n             Star.

Its projection on the plane of the\r\nphotographic plate is therefore elliptical; but the projection of the\r\nmirror and its cell on the plane of the great mirror is very nearly\r\ncircular.\r\n\r\nThe small mirror, acting as a central stop, has the effect of diminishing\r\nthe size of the central disk of the diffraction pattern, at the expense of\r\nan increase in the brightness of the system of rings. To this effect may\r\nbe due, in part, the inferiority of the reflector for resolving bright\r\ndoubles, as compared with a refractor of the same aperture. For\r\nphotographic purposes, it is evident that the mirror is practically\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nThe upper end of the tube can be rotated, carrying with it the flat and\r\nthe eye-end. Whenever the position is changed, the mirrors have to be\r\nre-collimated. In practice it is seldom necessary to touch the adjusting\r\nscrews of the mirrors themselves. The adjustment is effected by means of\r\nclamping and butting screws on the eye-end, and a change of the line of\r\ncollimation, with respect to the finders and the circles, is avoided. The\r\noperation is generally referred to, however, as an adjustment of the\r\nmirrors.\r\n\r\nFor adjusting the mirrors there are two collimators. One of these is of\r\nthe form devised by Mr. Crossley.[7] It is very convenient in use, and is\r\nsufficiently accurate for the adjustment of the eye-end when the telescope\r\nis used for photographic purposes, inasmuch as the exact place where the\r\naxis of the large mirror cuts the photographic plate is not then a matter\r\nof great importance, so long as it is near the center. Moreover, as stated\r\nfarther below, the direction of the axis changes during a long exposure.\r\nThe other collimator is of a form originally due, I think, to Dr.\r\nJohnstone Stoney. It consists of a small telescope, which fits the\r\ndraw-tube at the eye-end. In the focus of the eyepiece are, instead of\r\ncross-wires, two adjustable terminals, between which an electric spark can\r\nbe passed, generated by a small induction machine, like a replenisher,\r\nheld in the observer's hand. The terminals are at such a distance inside\r\nthe principal focus of the objective, that the light from the spark, after\r\nreflection from the flat, appears to proceed from the center of curvature\r\nof the large mirror. The rays are therefore reflected back normally, and\r\nform an image of the spark which, when the mirrors are in perfect\r\nadjustment, coincides with the spark itself. The precision of this method\r\nis very great. It is in fact out of proportion to the degree of refinement\r\nattained in other adjustments of the reflector, for a slight pressure of\r\nthe hand on the draw-tube, or movement of the telescope to a different\r\naltitude, instantly destroys the perfection of the adjustment. I have\r\nprovided these collimators with an adapter which fits the photographic\r\napparatus, so that one can adjust the mirrors without having to remove\r\nthis apparatus and substitute for it the ordinary eye-end carrying the\r\neyepieces.\r\n\r\nFor visual observation the Crossley telescope is provided with seven\r\neyepieces, with powers ranging from 620 downward. The lowest power is only\r\n60, and consequently utilizes only 12 inches of the mirror, 9 of which are\r\ncovered by the central flat. It is therefore of little value, except for\r\nfinding purposes. The next lowest power utilizes 28 inches of the mirror.\r\nThe other eyepieces call for no remark.\r\n\r\nBut, while the Crossley reflector would doubtless be serviceable for\r\nvarious kinds of visual observations, its photographic applications are\r\nregarded as having the most importance, and have been chiefly considered\r\nin deciding upon the different changes and improvements which have been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the dome is lighted at night by a large lamp, which is\r\nenclosed in a suitable box or lantern, fitted with panes of red glass, and\r\nmounted on a portable stand. In order to diffuse the light in the lower\r\npart of the dome, where most of the assistant's work is done, the walls\r\nare painted bright red; while to prevent reflected light from reaching the\r\nphotographic plate, the inner surface of the dome itself, the mounting,\r\nand the ladders and gallery are painted dead black. The observer is\r\ntherefore in comparative darkness, and not the slightest fogging of the\r\nplate, from the red light below, is produced during a four-hours'\r\nexposure. On the few occasions when orthochromatic plates are used the\r\nlamp need not be lighted.\r\n\r\nExperiments have shown that the fogging of the photographic plate, during\r\na long exposure, is entirely due to diffuse light from the sky, and is\r\ntherefore unavoidable. For this reason the cloth curtains which lace to\r\nthe corners of the telescope tube, enclosing it and shutting out light\r\nfrom the lower part of the dome, have not been used, since their only\r\neffect would be to catch the wind and cause vibrations of the telescope.\r\nThey would probably have little effect on the definition, and at any rate\r\ncould not be expected to improve it.\r\n\r\nFor photographing stars and nebulae the Crossley reflector is provided with\r\na double-slide plate-holder, of the form invented by Dr. Common.[8] This\r\napparatus, which had suffered considerably in transportation, and from\r\ngeneral wear and tear, was thoroughly overhauled by the Observatory\r\ninstrument-maker. The plates were straightened and the slides refitted. A\r\nspring was introduced to oppose the right ascension screw and take up the\r\nlost motion--the most annoying defect that such a piece of apparatus can\r\nhave--and various other improvements were made, as the necessity for them\r\nbecame apparent. They are described in detail farther below.\r\n\r\nThe present appearance of the eye-end is shown in the illustration. The\r\nplate-holder is there shown, however, on one side of the tube, and its\r\nlonger side is parallel to the axis of the telescope. This is not a good\r\nposition for the eye-end, except for short exposures. In practice, the\r\neye-end is always placed on the north or south side of the tube, according\r\nas the object photographed is north or south of the zenith. The right\r\nascension slide is then always at right angles to the telescope axis, and\r\nthe eye-end can not get into an inaccessible position during a long\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\nAs the original wooden plate-holders were warped, and could not be\r\ndepended upon to remain in the same position for several hours at a time,\r\nthey were replaced by new ones of metal, and clamping screws were added,\r\nto hold them firmly in place. The heads of these screws are shown in the\r\nplate, between the springs which press the plate-holder against its bed.\r\n\r\nTo illuminate the cross-wires of the guiding eyepiece, a small electric\r\nlamp is used, the current for which is brought down from the storage\r\nbattery at the main Observatory. The coarse wires have been replaced by\r\nspider's webs,[9] and reflectors have been introduced, to illuminate the\r\ndeclination thread. A collimating lens, placed at its principal focal\r\ndistance from the incandescent filament of the lamp, makes the\r\nillumination of the wires nearly independent of their position on the\r\nslide, and a piece of red glass, close to the lens, effectually removes\r\nall danger of fogging the plate. The light is varied to suit the\r\nrequirements of observation by rotating the reflector which throws the\r\nlight in the direction of the eyepiece.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUBLE-SLIDE PLATE-HOLDER OF THE CROSSLEY REFLECTOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn long exposures it is important for the observer to know at any moment\r\nthe position of the plate with reference to its central or zero position.\r\nFor this purpose scales with indexes are attached to both slides; but as\r\nthey can not be seen in the dark, and, even if illuminated with red light,\r\ncould not be read without removing the eye from the guiding eyepiece, I\r\nhave added two short pins, one of which is attached to the lower side of\r\nthe right ascension slide, and the other to its guide, so that the points\r\ncoincide when the scale reads zero. These pins can be felt by the fingers,\r\nand with a little practice the observer can tell very closely how far the\r\nplate is from its central position. It would not be a very difficult\r\nmatter to improve on this contrivance, say by placing an illuminated\r\nscale, capable of independent adjustment, in the field of the eyepiece,\r\nbut the pins answer every purpose. The declination slide is changed so\r\nlittle that no means for indicating its position are necessary.\r\n\r\nIn this apparatus, as originally constructed, the cross-wires of the\r\nguiding eyepiece were exactly in the plane of the photographic plate. The\r\nearlier observations made with the Crossley reflector on Mount Hamilton\r\nshowed that this is not the best position of the cross-wires. The image of\r\na star in the guiding eyepiece, which, when in the middle of its slide, is\r\nnearly three inches from the axis of the mirror, is not round, and its\r\nshape varies as the eyepiece is pushed in or drawn out. In the plane of\r\nthe photographic plate (assumed to be accurately in focus), it is a\r\ncrescent, with the convex side directed toward the center of the plate.\r\nThis form of image is not suitable for accurate guiding. Outside this\r\nposition the image changes to an arrow-head, the point of which is\r\ndirected toward the axis, and this image can be very accurately bisected\r\nby the right ascension thread. As the construction of the apparatus did\r\nnot allow the plane of the cross-wires to be changed, the wooden bed of\r\nthe plate-holder was cut down, so as to bring the wires and the plate into\r\nthe proper relative positions.\r\n\r\nAfter some further experience with the instrument, still another change\r\nwas made in this adjustment. It was found that the focus often changed\r\nvery perceptibly during a long exposure, and while the arrow-head image\r\nabove described was suitable for guiding purposes, its form was not\r\ngreatly affected by changes of focus. Between the crescent and the\r\narrow-head images there is a transition form, in which two well-defined\r\ncaustic curves in the aberration pattern intersect at an acute angle. The\r\nintersection of these caustics offers an excellent mark for the\r\ncross-wires, and is at the same time very sensitive to changes of focus,\r\nwhich cause it to travel up or down in the general pattern. The bed of the\r\nplate-holder was therefore raised, by facing it with a brass plate of the\r\nproper thickness.\r\n\r\nWhy the focus of the telescope should change during a long exposure is not\r\nquite clear. The change is much too great to be accounted for by expansion\r\nand contraction of the rods forming the tube, following changes of\r\ntemperature, while a simple geometrical construction shows that a drooping\r\nof the upper end of the tube, increasing the distance of the plate from\r\nthe (unreflected) axis of the mirror, can not displace the focus in a\r\ndirection normal to the plate, if it is assumed that the field is flat.\r\nThe observed effect is probably due to the fact that the focal surface is\r\nnot flat, but curved. During a long exposure, the observer keeps the\r\nguiding star, and therefore, very approximately, all other stars, in the\r\nsame positions relatively to the plate; but he has no control over the\r\nposition of the axis of the mirror, which, by changes of flexure, wanders\r\nirregularly over the field. The position of maximum curvature, therefore,\r\nalso varies, and with it the focus of the guiding star relatively to the\r\ncross-wires, where the focal surface is considerably inclined to the field\r\nof view. It is certain that the focus does change considerably, whatever\r\nthe cause may be, and that the best photographic star images are obtained\r\nby keeping the focus of the guiding star unchanged during the exposures.\r\nThis is done by turning the focusing screw of the eye-end.\r\n\r\nIn making the photographs of nebulae for which the Crossley telescope is at\r\npresent regularly employed, it was at first our practice to adjust the\r\ndriving-clock as accurately as possible to a sidereal rate, and then, when\r\nthe star had drifted too far from its original position, on account of\r\nchanges of rate or of flexure, to bring it back by the right-ascension\r\nslow motion, the observer either closing the slide of the plate-holder or\r\nfollowing the motion of the star as best he could with the right-ascension\r\nscrew. Lately a more satisfactory method, suggested by Mr. Palmer, has\r\nbeen employed. The slow motion in right ascension is of Grubb's form,[10]\r\nand the telescope has two slightly different rates, according to whether\r\nthe loose wheel is stopped or allowed to turn freely. The driving-clock is\r\nadjusted so that one of these rates is too fast, the other too slow. At\r\nthe beginning of an exposure the wheel is, say, unclamped, and the guiding\r\nstar begins to drift very slowly toward the left, the observer following\r\nit with the screw of the plate-holder. When it has drifted far enough, as\r\nindicated by the pins mentioned farther above, the wheel is clamped. The\r\nstar then reverses its motion and begins to drift toward the right; and so\r\non throughout the exposure. The advantages of this method over the one\r\npreviously employed are, that the star never has to be moved by the slow\r\nmotion of the telescope, and that its general drift is in a known\r\ndirection, so that its movements can be anticipated by the observer. In\r\nthis way photographs are obtained, with four hours' exposure, on which the\r\nsmallest star disks are almost perfectly round near the center of the\r\nplate, and from 2'' to 3'' in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe star images are practically round over a field at least 1 inch or 16'\r\nin diameter. Farther from the center they become parabolic, but they are\r\nquite good over the entire plate, 3-1/4 by 4-1/4 inches.\r\n\r\nFrom these statements it will be seen that small irregularities in driving\r\nno longer present any difficulties. But certain irregular motions of the\r\nimage still take place occasionally, and so far it has not been possible\r\nentirely to prevent their occurrence.\r\n\r\nIt was found that the declination clamp (the long slow-motion handle\r\nattached to which is shown in the illustration) was not sufficiently\r\npowerful to hold the telescope firmly during a long exposure. A screw\r\nclamp was therefore added, which forces the toothed-declination sector\r\nstrongly against an iron block just behind it, thus restoring, I think,\r\nthe original arrangement of the declination clamp as designed by Dr.\r\nCommon. This clamp holds the tube very firmly.\r\n\r\nThe irregularities to which I have referred consist in sudden and\r\nunexpected jumps of the image, which always occur some time after the\r\ntelescope has passed the meridian. These jumps are sometimes quite\r\nlarge--as much as one-sixteenth of an inch or 1. They are due to two\r\ncauses: flexure of the tube, and sliding of the mirror on its bed. When\r\nthe jump is due to sudden changes of flexure, the image moves very\r\nquickly, and vibrates before it comes to rest in its new position, and at\r\nthe same time there is often heard a slight ringing sound from the tension\r\nrods of the tube. There seems to be no remedy for the sudden motions of\r\nthis class. The tension rods are set up as tightly as possible without\r\nendangering the threads at their ends or buckling the large corner tubes.\r\nA round telescope tube, made of spirally-wound steel ribbon riveted at the\r\ncrossings, would probably be better than the square tube now in use.\r\n\r\nJumps due to shifting of the mirror are characterized by a gentle, gliding\r\nmotion. They can be remedied, in part, at least, by tightening the copper\r\nbands which pass around the circumference of the mirror within its cell.\r\nThis will be done the next time the mirror is resilvered.\r\n\r\nAll that the observer can do when a jump occurs is to bring back the image\r\nas quickly as possible to the intersection of the cross-wires. If all the\r\nstars on the plate are faint, no effect will be produced on the\r\nphotograph; but stars of the eighth magnitude or brighter will leave short\r\ntrails. The nebula, if there is one on the plate, will, of course, be\r\nunaffected.\r\n\r\nBefore beginning an exposure the focus is adjusted by means of a\r\nhigh-power positive eyepiece. An old negative, from which the film has\r\nbeen partially scraped, is placed in one of the plate-holders, and the\r\nfilm is brought into the common focus of the eyepiece and the great\r\nmirror. The appearance of the guiding star, which varies somewhat with the\r\nposition of the guiding eyepiece on its slide, is then carefully noted,\r\nand is kept constant during the exposure by turning, when necessary, the\r\nfocusing screw of the eye-end. For preliminary adjustments a ground-glass\r\nscreen is often convenient. On it all the _DM._ stars, and even\r\nconsiderably fainter ones, as well as the nebulae of Herschel's Class I,\r\nare easily visible without a lens.\r\n\r\nPlates are backed, not more than a day or two before use, with Carbutt's\r\n\"Columbian backing,\" which is an excellent preparation for this purpose.\r\nDuring the exposure the observer and assistant exchange places every half\r\nhour, thereby greatly relieving the tediousness of the work, though two\r\nexposures of four hours each, in one night, have proved to be too\r\nfatiguing for general practice. At the end of the first two hours it is\r\nnecessary to close the slide and wind the clock.\r\n\r\nThe brightness of the guiding star is a matter of some importance. If the\r\nstar is too bright, its glare is annoying; if it is too faint, the effort\r\nto see it strains the eye, and changes of focus are not easily recognized.\r\nA star of the ninth magnitude is about right. In most cases a suitable\r\nstar can be found without difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn such an apparatus as that described above, the amount by which the\r\nplate may be allowed to depart from its zero position is subject to a\r\nlimitation which has not, I think, been pointed out, although it is\r\nsufficiently obvious when one's attention has been called to it. It\r\ndepends upon the fact that the plate necessarily moves as a whole, in a\r\nstraight line which is tangent to a great circle of the sphere, while the\r\nstars move on small circles around the pole. The compensation for drift,\r\nwhen the plate is moved, is therefore exact at the equator only.\r\n\r\nLet the guiding star have the declination [Greek: delta]_{1}, and let a\r\nstar on the upper edge of the plate (which, when the telescope is north of\r\nthe zenith, and the eye-end is on the north side of the telescope, will be\r\nthe southern edge) have the declination [Greek: delta]_{2}. Then if the\r\nguiding star is allowed to drift from its zero position through the\r\ndistance _d_, the other star will drift through the distance _d_ (cos\r\n[Greek: delta]_{2} / cos [Greek: delta]_{1}). If the guiding star is\r\nfollowed by turning the right-ascension screw, the upper edge of the\r\nplate, as well as the guiding eyepiece, will be moved through the distance\r\n_d_. Hence there will be produced an elongation of the upper star,\r\nrepresented by\r\n\r\n  _e_ = _d_ ((cos [Greek: delta]_{2} / cos [Greek: delta]_{1}) - 1)\r\n\r\n  from which _d_ = (_e_ cos [Greek: delta]_{1}) /\r\n                    (cos [Greek: delta]_{2} - cos [Greek: delta_{1}]).\r\n\r\nNow, in the Crossley reflector, the upper edge of the plate and the\r\nguiding eyepiece are just about 3-2/3 inches, or 1 deg., apart. If _e_ is\r\ngiven, the above formula serves to determine the maximum range of the\r\nslide for different positions of the telescope.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated farther above that the smallest star disks, on a good\r\nphotograph, are sometimes not more than 2'' in diameter, or in a linear\r\nmeasure, about 1/20 mm. An elongation of this amount is therefore\r\nperceptible. There are many nebulae in high northern declinations, and\r\nthere are several particularly fine ones in about +70 deg.. If, therefore, we\r\ntake [Greek: delta]_{2} = 70 deg., [Greek: delta]_{1}, = 71 deg., _e_ = 0.05, and\r\nsubstitute these values, we find _d_ = 1.0 mm, which is the greatest\r\npermissible range of the plate in photographing these nebulae. Before I\r\nrealized the stringency of this requirement, by making the above simple\r\ncomputation, I spoiled several otherwise fine negatives by allowing the\r\nplate to get too far from the center, thus producing elongated star\r\nimages.\r\n\r\nThere is a corresponding elongation in declination, the amount of which\r\ncan be determined by an adaptation of the formula for reduction to the\r\nmeridian, but it is practically insensible.\r\n\r\nOn account of the short focal length of the three-foot mirror, the\r\nphotographic resolving power of the telescope is much below its optical\r\nresolving power. For this reason the photographic images are less\r\nsensitive to conditions affecting the seeing than the visual images. On\r\nthe finest nights the delicate tracery of bright lines or caustic curves\r\nin the guiding star is as clear and distinct as in a printed pattern. When\r\nthe seeing is only fair these delicate details are lost, and only the\r\ngeneral form of the image, with its two principal caustics, is seen. A\r\nphotograph taken on such a night is not, however, perceptibly inferior to\r\none taken when the seeing is perfect. When, however, the image is so\r\nblurred that its general form is barely distinguishable, the photographic\r\nstar disks are likewise blurred and enlarged, and on such nights\r\nphotographic work is not attempted.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing account of the small changes which have been made in the\r\nCrossley telescope and its accessories may appear to be unnecessarily\r\ndetailed, yet these small changes have greatly increased the practical\r\nefficiency of the instrument, and, therefore, small as they are, they are\r\nimportant. Particularly with an instrument of this character, the\r\ndifference between poor and good results lies in the observance of just\r\nsuch small details as I have described.\r\n\r\nAt present the Crossley reflector is being used for photographing nebulae,\r\nfor which purpose it is very effective. Some nebulae and clusters, like the\r\ngreat nebula in _Andromeda_ and the _Pleiades_, are too large for its\r\nplate (3-1/4 x 4-1/4 in.), but the great majority of nebulae are very much\r\nsmaller, having a length of only a few minutes of arc, and a large-scale\r\nphotograph is required to show them satisfactorily. It is particularly\r\nimportant to have the images of the involved stars as small as they can be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nMany nebulae of Herschel's I and II classes are so bright that fairly good\r\nphotographs can be obtained with exposures of from one to two hours; but\r\nthe results obtained with full-light action are so superior to these, that\r\nlonger exposures of three and one half or four hours are always preferred.\r\nIn some exceptional cases, exposures of only a few minutes are sufficient.\r\nThe amount of detail shown, even in the case of very small nebulae, is\r\nsurprising. It is an interesting fact that these photographs confirm (in\r\nsome cases for the first time) many of the visual observations made with\r\nthe six-foot reflector of the Earl of Rosse.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, in making these photographs, great numbers of new nebulae\r\nhave been discovered. The largest number that I have found on any one\r\nplate is thirty-one. Eight or ten is not an uncommon number, and few\r\nphotographs have been obtained which do not reveal the existence of three\r\nor four. A catalogue of these new objects will be published in due time.\r\n\r\nSome of the results obtained with the Crossley reflector, relating chiefly\r\nto particular objects of some special interest, have already been\r\npublished.[11] The photographs have also permitted some wider conclusions\r\nto be drawn, which are constantly receiving further confirmation as the\r\nwork progresses. They may be briefly summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Many thousands of unrecorded nebulae exist in the sky. A conservative\r\nestimate places the number within reach of the Crossley reflector at about\r\n120,000. The number of nebulae in our catalogues is but a small fraction of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n2. These nebulae exhibit all gradations of apparent size, from the great\r\nnebula in _Andromeda_ down to an object which is hardly distinguishable\r\nfrom a faint star disk.\r\n\r\n3. Most of these nebulae have a spiral structure.\r\n\r\nTo these conclusions I may add another, of more restricted significance,\r\nthough the evidence in favor of it is not yet complete. Among the objects\r\nwhich have been photographed with the Crossley telescope are most of the\r\n\"double\" nebulae figured in Sir John Herschel's catalogue (_Phil. Trans._,\r\n1833, Plate XV). The actual nebulae, as photographed, have almost no\r\nresemblance to the figures. They are, in fact, spirals, sometimes of very\r\nbeautiful and complex structure; and, in any one of the nebulae, the\r\nsecondary nucleus of Herschel's figure is either a part of the spiral\r\napproaching the main nucleus in brightness, or it can not be identified\r\nwith any real part of the object. The significance of this somewhat\r\ndestructive conclusion lies in the fact that these figures of Herschel\r\nhave sometimes been regarded as furnishing analogies for the figures which\r\nPoincare had deduced, from theoretical considerations, as being among the\r\npossible forms assumed by a rotating fluid mass; in other words, they have\r\nbeen regarded as illustrating an early stage in the development of double\r\nstar systems. The actual conditions of motion in these particular nebulae,\r\nas indicated by the photographs, are obviously very much more complicated\r\nthan those considered in the theoretical discussion.\r\n\r\nWhile I must leave to others an estimate of the importance of these\r\nconclusions, it seems to me that they have a very direct bearing on many,\r\nif not all, questions concerning the cosmogony. If, for example, the\r\nspiral is the form normally assumed by a contracting nebulous mass, the\r\nidea at once suggests itself that the solar system has been evolved from a\r\nspiral nebula, while the photographs show that the spiral nebula is not,\r\nas a rule, characterized by the simplicity attributed to the contracting\r\nmass in the nebular hypothesis. This is a question which has already been\r\ntaken up by Professor Chamberlin and Mr. Moulton of the University of\r\nChicago.\r\n\r\nThe Crossley reflector promises to be useful in a number of fields which\r\nare fairly well defined. It is clearly unsuitable for photographing the\r\nMoon and planets, and for star charting. On the other hand, it has proved\r\nto be of value for finding and photographically observing asteroids whose\r\npositions are already approximately known.\r\n\r\nOne of the most fruitful fields for this instrument is undoubtedly stellar\r\nspectroscopy. Little has been done in this field, as yet, with the\r\nCrossley reflector, but two spectrographs, with which systematic\r\ninvestigations will be made, have nearly been completed by the Observatory\r\ninstrument-maker. One of these, constructed with the aid of a fund given\r\nby the late Miss C. W. Bruce, has a train of three 60 deg. prisms and one 30 deg.\r\nprism, and an aperture of two inches; the other, which has a single quartz\r\nprism, will, I have reason to expect, give measurable, though small,\r\nspectra of stars nearly at the limit of vision of the telescope.\r\n\r\nThe photogravure[12] of the Trifid nebula, which accompanies this article,\r\nwas made from a photograph taken with the Crossley reflector on July 6,\r\n1899, with an exposure of three hours. It was not selected as a specimen\r\nof the work of the instrument, for the negative was made in the early\r\nstages of the experiments that I have described, and the star images are\r\nnot good, but rather on account of the interest of the subject. At the\r\ntime the photogravures were ordered no large scale photograph of the\r\nTrifid nebula had, so far as I am aware, ever been published.[13] The\r\nremarkable branching structure of the nebula is fairly well shown in the\r\nphotogravure, though less distinctly than in the transparency from which\r\nit was made. The enlargement, as compared with the original negative, is\r\n2.9 diameters (1 mm = 13''). The fainter parts of the nebula would be\r\nshown more satisfactorily by a longer exposure.\r\n\r\nLIST OF NEBULAE AND CLUSTERS PHOTOGRAPHED.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |N.G.C.| [Greek: a]|[Greek: d]|            Remarks.                    |\r\n  |  No. |  1900.0   |  1900.0  |                                        |\r\n  |----------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n  |      |  h  m  s  |   deg.

Not. R. A. S._, =49=, 297. The construction here described is\r\nnot followed exactly in the Crossley apparatus. The guiding eyepiece\r\nslides freely when not held by a clamp. Pin-holes for preventing fogging\r\nare unnecessary when red light is used.\r\n\r\n[9] It so happens that the tension of the vertical thread is such that it\r\nbegins to slacken when the temperature falls to within about 2 deg. of the dew\r\npoint. The thread thus forms an excellent hygrometer, which is constantly\r\nunder the eye of the observer. When the thread becomes slack, it is time\r\nto cover the mirrors.\r\n\r\n[10] _Mon. Not. R. A.
