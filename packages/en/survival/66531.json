The national\r\ntemperament is often held to be responsible for this failing; but some\r\nof the blame must no doubt be laid at the door of the weather itself.\r\nOur climate presents such a record of change and uncertainty, that we\r\nneed not wonder if it is always in our minds, and the first subject on\r\nour lips when we meet a friend. Other lands may have their cold and\r\nhot, dry, and rainy periods, that come round in the proper order year\r\nafter year with unvarying monotony; but with us it may be said of the\r\nweather, that we rarely know what a day or an hour may bring forth.\r\nEven the seasons seem occasionally to be independent of any necessity\r\nof visiting us at the particular time of the year at which we have\r\nbeen taught to expect them. Spring weather in November, or a winter\r\ntemperature in July, or a November fog in the merry month of May, all\r\nseem to be amongst the possibilities of our climate.\r\n\r\nHappily, our meteorologists are at length beginning to define with\r\ngrowing clearness and confidence the laws which underlie and regulate\r\nthe complicated and ever varying phenomena which we call the weather,\r\nand many of these laws, like most natural laws, are beautiful in\r\ntheir simplicity. Although ‘weather wisdom’ is as old as history\r\nitself, the science of the weather or meteorology is a growth of the\r\nlast few years. The weather wisdom of our forefathers may in the\r\nlight of present knowledge be divided into sense and nonsense. Under\r\nthe nonsense may be included not only such proverbs as that which\r\nattributed to St Swithin’s day and certain other times and seasons,\r\noccult influences over the weather, but most of the information of the\r\nold almanacs, which used to ascribe the character of the weather to\r\nthe positions and movements of the heavenly bodies and the age and\r\nchanges of the moon. The prevalence of the belief that the weather\r\nwas regulated by such influences, can only be accounted for by the\r\nwell-known love of the human mind for the wonderful and inexplicable.\r\nMuch of the old weather lore, however, had a large element of truth\r\nin it, and was the result of the collective experience of many\r\ngenerations, which had found that certain phenomena were generally\r\nfollowed by certain conditions of weather. The saying, that a rosy\r\nsky in the morning presages rainy weather, and the same appearance\r\nin the evening, fine weather, was current weather lore before the\r\nChristian era, and is recognised as being, in a certain sense, true at\r\nthe present day. Amongst sailors, farmers, shepherds, and such like,\r\nweather maxims, the result of observation and experience, have always\r\nbeen current, and the value of many of these is now recognised and\r\nexplained by science.\r\n\r\nThe first step towards acquiring an insight into the causes which\r\ncontrol our weather is a study of the laws which regulate the flow and\r\nchanges of the winds in these islands. The air is the great medium\r\nin which all the changes of weather are elaborated. We live at the\r\nbottom of a great ocean of air, which extends for many miles upwards,\r\nand which is always heaving and changing, like the other ocean which\r\nit covers. The winds, which are the ever-changing currents which flow\r\nthrough this invisible sea, are, roughly speaking, the principal\r\nfactors in the making of the weather. Many of us know very well the\r\ngeneral character of the weather which accompanies the wind from the\r\nprincipal points of the compass, that which comes from the moist warm\r\nsouth-west, for instance; or with the blustering, shower-bringing\r\nnorth-wester; or with the harsh, dry, east wind in spring; but to most\r\nof us the wind itself ‘bloweth where it listeth.’ The movements of the\r\nair and changes of the wind are, however, subject to laws, a knowledge\r\nof which is in some degree necessary before we can understand how our\r\nweather is made for us.\r\n\r\nA simple definition of the wind which we ordinarily experience is\r\nthat it is air obeying the force of gravity, in seeking to return to\r\nan equilibrium which has been disturbed. By the aid of the barometer\r\nwe are able to form some idea of what is constantly taking place\r\nin the great ocean above us. The principle upon which this simple\r\nand useful instrument is constructed is easily understood. The air\r\npresses downwards upon the earth’s surface with a weight averaging\r\nnearly fifteen pounds to the square inch. If a portion of the surface\r\nof any fluid is relieved from this pressure by inverting over it a\r\ntube exhausted of air, the weight of the air upon the surface outside\r\nwill force the fluid up into the tube until the weight of the column\r\ncounterbalances the pressure which the air would exercise upon the\r\namount of surface covered by the mouth of the tube. A column of mercury\r\nin such a case will rise in an air-exhausted tube to a height of about\r\nthirty inches; while water, from its lighter specific gravity, rises to\r\na height of about thirty-four feet before it counterbalances the weight\r\nof the air above. The depth, and consequently the pressure, of the air\r\noverhead is, however, constantly varying within certain limits; and the\r\ncolumn of mercury in the barometer enables us to keep a faithful record\r\nof the movements of the waves of air in the great ocean under which we\r\nlive. At times, the depth of air above us is comparatively shallow, and\r\nthe pressure beneath is lessened; the column of mercury is not raised\r\nso high, and the barometer is said to fall. At other times, the air\r\nis heaped up in particular places; the pressure beneath is increased,\r\nand the barometer is said to rise. In stormy weather, the column of\r\nwater in a water-barometer where the scale is very large may be seen to\r\npulsate with every change of pressure from the air-waves at the surface.\r\n\r\nThe winds are nothing more than the rush of air from the regions of\r\nhigh pressure to fill up the spaces where low pressure prevails. Thus,\r\nif the column of mercury should stand 28.6 inches high at London, with\r\na gradual rise as we travelled northward, until the barometer-reading\r\nwas 29 inches at Edinburgh at the same time, this would indicate that\r\na region of depression existed over the former place, and we should\r\nexpect a rush of air in the form of wind blowing upon London from the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nWhen the barometrical readings taken simultaneously at stations\r\ndistributed over a wide area are compared, the distribution of\r\natmospheric pressure can be ascertained, and it is possible to tell\r\nfrom this the force and direction of the winds prevailing within this\r\narea, and generally also the weather which is likely to be experienced.\r\nThe greater the inequality of pressure, the greater will be the rush of\r\nair to the centre of depression, and the stronger will be the wind. The\r\nwind, however, does not flow in a straight line from a region of high\r\nto a region of low pressure. The surrounding air from all quarters has\r\na tendency to flow in, and, as with water, which rushes to the centre\r\nof a funnel when it is flowing out at the bottom, a gyratory movement\r\nis the result. The wind blows round a centre of depression in this\r\nway, always curving inward towards the centre; and in the northern\r\nhemisphere, this gyratory movement of the wind is always in a direction\r\nagainst the hands of a watch, while the contrary is the case in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere. These principles of the relation of the winds to\r\natmospheric pressure hold good without exception over all the world.\r\nThey were first definitively stated in America twenty-five years ago;\r\nbut Professor Buys Ballot of Utrecht first drew attention to them in\r\nEurope, and the law expressing them is now generally recognised as Buys\r\nBallot’s law.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary circumstances in our latitude, the winds are generally\r\nregulated by the differences in pressure induced by contrasts between\r\ncontinents and oceans. Where the air becomes heated, an area of low\r\npressure is produced, the warm air becoming rarefied and ascending, and\r\nthe heavier cold air rushing in from the sides to supply its place. In\r\nwinter, the weather over these islands is controlled to a great extent\r\nby the winds which sweep round a large area of depression which exists\r\nover the Atlantic, the mean centre of which is about midway between\r\nthe continents of Europe and America, in the latitude of the Orkney\r\nIslands. This depression is the result of the contrast produced between\r\nthe comparatively warm air over this portion of the Atlantic and the\r\nmuch colder air over the northern portion of Europe and America,\r\nwhich is continually flowing in to supply the place of the lighter\r\nand constantly ascending warm air. The winds sweeping round this\r\ncentre strike our shores from the south-west. This depression is not\r\nstationary, but is continually shifting over a large but well-defined\r\narea, and it gives rise to many subsidiary eddies, or small cyclone\r\nsystems as they are called, which sometimes skirt our coasts, or travel\r\nover these islands, bringing with them the storms of wind and rain and\r\nsudden changes of the wind with which we are familiar. In spring, the\r\nprevailing winds from the east and north-east, so much dreaded by many,\r\nare the result of a large cyclonic system formed by the sudden increase\r\nof temperature over middle and southern Europe, as the sun’s rays gain\r\nstrength and the days lengthen. The temperature is not yet sufficiently\r\nhigh to bring in the air from off the Atlantic, as happens when the\r\nseason is further advanced, so that the cold air rushes in from the\r\npolar regions in a huge eddy, striking our coasts from the east and\r\nnorth-east, and bringing in its train all the attendant miseries which\r\nmake our English spring a time to be dreaded by the weak and ailing.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the general principles which direct the flow of our\r\nprevailing winds is, however, only of general assistance in enabling\r\nus to forecast the weather which we experience in these islands. This\r\nis governed and produced to a great extent by the development of\r\nsubsidiary centres of depression in and between the great cyclonic\r\nsystems. These generally approach our shores from the west, travelling\r\nin a north-easterly direction; and they are responsible for most of\r\nthe variable weather with which we are so familiar. They generally\r\ncarry with them a certain well-defined course of weather. The readings\r\nof the barometer taken simultaneously at many places over a wide\r\narea on a system such as that now controlled by the Meteorological\r\nOffice, enables us to determine the approach and development of these\r\nsmall cyclonic systems, and so to forecast with a certain degree of\r\nconfidence the weather likely to be experienced in a certain district\r\nfrom twelve to twenty-four hours in advance. Most of the disturbing\r\ninfluences reach us from the west; and as the west coast of Ireland\r\nis the extreme limit to which our stations reach in that direction,\r\nwe can receive only very short notice of their approach. This is\r\none of the principal reasons why, with the means at present at our\r\ndisposal, we cannot expect to make our weather science as perfect\r\nas in a country such as America, where the central office receives\r\nwarnings from stations dispersed over the face of a vast continent.\r\nNevertheless, we have made great advances since 1861, when the first\r\nweather forecasts were prepared and issued in this country by the Board\r\nof Trade, under the superintendence of the late Admiral Fitzroy. The\r\nforecasts at that time, although admitted to be of considerable utility\r\nto the country, were thought to be scarcely accurate enough to justify\r\ntheir continuance upon the system then in operation, and they were\r\ndiscontinued in 1866.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, the Meteorological Office was constituted\r\nupon its present footing, and the daily publication of forecasts has\r\ncontinued down to the present. Considering that—judging from the\r\nforecasts published daily in the newspapers—the chances of a successful\r\nforecast are on the average about seventy-nine per cent. for ordinary\r\nweather, while the percentage of successes is slightly higher in the\r\ncase of storm warnings, it is evident that the Meteorological Office is\r\ncapable of rendering important service to the community at large. Every\r\nmorning, the central office in London receives telegraphic reports\r\nfrom fifty-three stations. It also receives thirteen reports every\r\nafternoon, and nineteen each evening. Besides the numerous well-placed\r\nobservation stations in the British Islands, there are twenty-three\r\nforeign reporting stations, extending along the entire western coast\r\nof Europe, from which information is received, in accordance with\r\narrangements made with the meteorological organisations in Norway,\r\nSweden, Denmark, Germany, Holland, and France. The morning observations\r\nare made at all the British stations at eight A.M. Greenwich time, and\r\nare transmitted direct to the Meteorological Office, where they are\r\nreceived between nine and ten o’clock. Thus are given the barometrical\r\nand thermometrical readings at the various stations at eight A.M.;\r\nthe direction and force of the wind, and the state of the weather,\r\ntogether with any changes of importance which may have been noticed in\r\nthe course of the preceding day. From these reports, weather charts\r\nare made out, forecasts of the weather are prepared and issued to the\r\nevening papers in London and the provinces; and a telegraphic résumé of\r\nthe weather, or, if necessary, intelligence of storms, is despatched to\r\nvarious points on our coasts and to foreign countries. The forecasts\r\nfor the morning daily papers are issued at half-past eight P.M. on\r\nthe previous evening. They are prepared from reports received from\r\ntwenty-six home and six foreign stations; but although these are the\r\nmost widely distributed and read of any issued from the office, they\r\nare much less complete than the eight A.M. forecasts.\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ publishes every morning with the forecasts the weather\r\nchart issued by the department. This chart shows the condition and\r\nmovements of the atmosphere over the British Isles and the vicinity;\r\nthe distribution of pressure; the temperature, state of the sea, and\r\nthe force and direction of the winds blowing within the area at six\r\nP.M. on the previous day.\r\n\r\nThe familiar dotted lines termed isobars, which are such a feature in\r\nweather maps of this sort, are lines at all places along which the\r\nbarometer stands at the same height. Except where their regularity\r\nis broken by the existence of subsidiary disturbances, these lines\r\nextend in gradually widening circles around a centre of depression,\r\nthe barometer always standing highest along the outside curve, and\r\ngradually and regularly falling towards the centre; so that if we could\r\nview our atmosphere from above one of those centres of depression, we\r\nwould see a deep hollow, with sides sloping downwards to the centre,\r\ntowards which the revolving air was being gradually indrawn, like water\r\nin an eddy.\r\n\r\nAt intervals, we receive warning across the Atlantic, from the _New\r\nYork Herald_ weather bureau, respecting storms which are crossing\r\nthe Atlantic towards our coasts, and which are often described as\r\n‘likely to develop dangerous energy’ on their way. Although many of\r\nthose warnings are subsequently justified, or partially justified,\r\nit must not be supposed that these are storms which have left the\r\nAmerican continent on their way to us, and that it has been possible\r\nto calculate their course across the Atlantic and predict the\r\ntime of arrival upon our coasts. Mr Clement Ley, Inspector to the\r\nMeteorological Council, tells us that it is not yet satisfactorily\r\nshown that storms cross the Atlantic from America, and he presumes that\r\narrangements must be effected by which the logs of passing steamers may\r\nbe consulted in America as to the character of the weather experienced\r\nin crossing from this country; and from the information received in\r\nthis manner, it is possible to arrive at conclusions respecting the\r\ndirection and character of storms travelling towards this side of the\r\nAtlantic, and to anticipate their arrival by telegraph, the warning\r\nbeing flashed beneath the ocean in time to reach us long before the\r\nstorm itself.\r\n\r\nThe variety and complexity of the phenomena which have to pass under\r\ncareful observation render the science of the weather an exceedingly\r\ndifficult one to study, more especially as, up to the present, we have\r\ndone little more than master its fundamental principles. The time ought\r\nnot, however, to be far distant when we shall have the means at our\r\ndisposal to enable us to forecast the weather with a nearer approach to\r\ncertainty than we can attain at present. The results already obtained\r\nby the Meteorological Office are certainly encouraging, and it must\r\nbe remembered that, in attempting to forecast the weather in this\r\ncountry, it labours under two serious disadvantages. The first is our\r\ngeographical position, which at present precludes us from obtaining\r\nany but the shortest notice of weather approaching from the west—the\r\npoint from which most of our weather comes. The other drawback is of a\r\npecuniary nature, and it is to be regretted that it prevents us from\r\ntesting to the full limit the usefulness of the Meteorological Office.\r\nIt may be argued that, in this country, storms are seldom so sudden or\r\ndisastrous as to justify us in maintaining at a very much larger outlay\r\nan organisation which would enable us to be warned of their approach.\r\nIt is, however, only necessary to take into account the enormous losses\r\nin life and property occasioned every year by the weather in shipwreck\r\nalone, in order to appreciate what might be the value to the nation of\r\na properly organised system of weather science, did it only succeed in\r\nreducing, even by a small percentage, the annual number of wrecks on\r\nour coasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY MEAD AND STREAM.\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES GIBBON.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.—POOR COMFORT.\r\n\r\nMadge awakened from the reverie into which she had fallen, to find\r\nAunt Hessy’s kind eyes resting on her inquiringly and with a shade of\r\nsorrow in them. She, however, instantly awoke, brightened and spoke\r\nwith cheerful confidence, although there was a certain note of timidity\r\nin her voice indicating that she had not yet quite recovered from the\r\neffects of the scene in her bedroom.\r\n\r\n‘You see, aunt, how wickedly Philip has been deceived, and that I was\r\nright to trust Mr Shield.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, but—Mr Beecham?’\r\n\r\nMadge’s cheeks flushed, the smile disappeared, and the head was lifted\r\nwith something like impatience. It seemed as if the pronunciation\r\nof Beecham’s name in that questioning tone revealed to her the full\r\nsignificance of Wrentham’s insinuations—that she was not acting fairly\r\nto Philip.\r\n\r\n‘I have told you, aunt, that he is Mr Shield’s friend, and that\r\nhe is doing everything that can be done to help Philip out of his\r\ndifficulties. You cannot doubt that whatever I may do is for the same\r\nobject.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, child, I never doubted thee. My doubt is that whilst desiring to\r\ndo right thou may’st have done wrong in giving the trust to a stranger\r\nthou’rt afraid to give to those that love thee.’\r\n\r\n‘Mr Beecham will himself tell you before the week is out that he gave\r\nme such proofs of his friendship as would have satisfied even you.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, well, we shall say no more, child, till the time comes;\r\nbut never expect goodman Dick to be patient with what he thinks\r\nunreasonable. See what a handle this rogue Wrentham—I always felt\r\nthat he was a rogue—has made of thy name to help him in cheating and\r\nbamboozling Philip! Take my word, we may turn our toes barely an inch\r\nfrom the straight path at starting, but we’ll find ourselves miles from\r\nit ere the end if we do not make a quick halt and go back.’\r\n\r\n‘I have only held my tongue,’ said the girl quietly enough, but the\r\nfeeling of offended innocence was there.\r\n\r\n‘Holding the tongue when one should speak out is as bad as telling a\r\nbook of lies—worse, for we don’t know how to deal with it.’\r\n\r\n‘I should be less sorry for vexing you, aunt,’ said the niece, ‘if I\r\ndid not know that by-and-by you will be sorry for having been vexed\r\nwith me.’\r\n\r\n‘So be it.—But now let us finish clearing up the room, and we’ll get\r\nthe bedstead down in the morning. Dr Joy says that Mr Hadleigh is not\r\nnearly so much hurt as was thought at first, and that they may be able\r\nto move him in a day or two.’\r\n\r\nWhen the arrangements for turning the sitting-room into a bedroom had\r\nbeen completed—and there were nice details to be attended to in the\r\noperation, which the dame would intrust to no other hands than her own\r\nand her niece’s—Madge went in search of Pansy.\r\n\r\nHer sudden appearance in the kitchen interrupted the boisterous mirth\r\nwhich was going forward. When she inquired for Pansy Culver, there was\r\nan abashed look on the faces of those who had permitted the girl to go\r\nwithout inquiring whither; but Jenny Wodrow answered saucily:\r\n\r\n‘She got into a state when I was talking about Caleb Kersey, and\r\nslipped out before any of us could say Jack Robinson.’\r\n\r\nThe silent reproof in the expression of Madge’s tender eyes had its\r\neffect even on this self-assertive damsel. Jerry Mogridge hobbled up to\r\nhis young mistress.\r\n\r\n‘I’ll find her for you, Missy,’ he said cheerily, for he was in the\r\nhappy state of mind of one who has enjoyed a good meal and knows that\r\nthere is a good sleep lying between him and the next day’s toil.\r\n\r\nThey went out to the yard, and Jerry, opening the door of the dairy,\r\nthrust his head into the darkness with the invocation: ‘Come out ov\r\nhere, Pansy Culver; what are you doing there? Missy wants you.’ There\r\nwas no answer, and after groping his way amidst cans and pails standing\r\nready for the morning’s milk, he returned muttering: ‘She ain’t there\r\nanyhow. I’ll get the lantern, Missy, and we’ll soon find her, so being\r\nas she ha’n’t gone to her father’s.’\r\n\r\nWhilst Jerry went for the lantern, the moon began to light the\r\nsnow-covered ground, and Madge discovered Pansy in the doorway of the\r\nstable. She was leaning against the door as if support were necessary\r\nto save her from falling. Madge put her arm round the girl, and drawing\r\nher out from the shadows into the moonlight, saw that the face was\r\nwhite as the snow at their feet, and felt that the form was shivering\r\nwith agitation more than with cold.\r\n\r\n‘I knew it would upset you, Pansy; and intended to tell you myself, but\r\nwanted to do it when we were alone.’\r\n\r\n‘It doesn’t matter, Missy,’ answered the girl through her chattering\r\nteeth; ‘but thank you kindly. There’s no help for it now. I’ve been\r\nthe ruin of him, and standing out here, I’ve seen how wicked and cruel\r\nI’ve been to him. I knew what he was thinking about, and I might have\r\ntold him not to think of it—but I liked him—I like him, and I wish they\r\nwould take me in his place. They ought to take me, for it was me that\r\ndrove him to it.’\r\n\r\n‘Hush, hush, Pansy,’ said Madge with gentle firmness; ‘Caleb is\r\ninnocent, and will be free in a few days. It was only some foolish\r\nbusiness he had with Coutts Hadleigh which brought him under\r\nsuspicion.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, yes, but it was about me that he went to speak to Mr Coutts—and\r\nMr Coutts never said anything to me that a gentleman might not say.\r\nOnly he was very kind—very kind, and I came to think of him, and—and—it\r\nwas all me—all me! And you, though you didn’t mean it, showed me\r\nhow wrong it was, and I went away. And if Caleb had only waited,\r\nmaybe—maybe.... I don’t know right what I am saying; but I would have\r\ncome to myself, and have tried to make him happy.’\r\n\r\nThis hysterical cry showed the best and the worst sides of the girl’s\r\ncharacter. For a brief space she had yielded to the vanity of her sex,\r\nwhich accepts the commonplaces of gallantry as special tributes to the\r\nindividual, and so had misinterpreted the attentions which Coutts would\r\nhave paid to any pretty girl who came in his way. She had been rudely\r\nstartled from her folly, and was now paying bitter penance for it. She\r\ntook to herself all the blame of Caleb’s guilt, and insisted that she\r\nshould be in jail, not him.\r\n\r\nMadge allowed her feelings to have full vent, and then was able to\r\ncomfort her with the reiterated assurance of Caleb’s innocence, which\r\nwould be speedily proved.\r\n\r\nThe fit being over, Pansy showed herself to be a sensible being, and\r\nlistened attentively to the kindly counsel of her friend. She agreed\r\nto follow her original plan, namely, to see her father in the morning\r\nand then return to Camberwell to devote her whole energies to the task\r\nof reclaiming her grandfather from his foolish ways and bringing him\r\nout to Ringsford. Madge was certain that this occupation would prove\r\nthe best antidote to all Pansy’s unhappy thoughts and self-reproaches.\r\nMeanwhile it was arranged that Pansy should not have Jenny Wodrow for\r\nher bedfellow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAffairs at the farm had gone on uncomfortably from the moment\r\nDick Crawshay expressed displeasure with his niece. She made what\r\nadvances she could towards reconciliation; but she did not yet offer\r\nany explanation. He was obliged to accept her customary service as\r\nsecretary; but it was evident that he would have liked to dispense with\r\nit. Neither his appetite nor his slumbers were disturbed, however; and\r\nhe slept soundly through the night whilst the fire was raging at the\r\nManor. It was not until the wain with its load of milk-cans had started\r\nfor the station that he heard from Jerry Mogridge the report of what\r\nhad occurred.\r\n\r\nThen yeoman Dick mounted his horse and rode at full speed to Ringsford\r\nto offer what help it might be in his power to render, grumbling at\r\nhimself all the way for not having been sooner aware of his neighbour’s\r\ndanger. Finding Mr Hadleigh in the gardener’s cottage, where there was\r\nwant of space and convenience, the farmer with impetuous hospitality\r\ninvited the whole family to Willowmere. The invalid could not be\r\nremoved until the doctor gave permission; but Caroline and Bertha were\r\nat once escorted to the farm. Miss Hadleigh remained at the cottage to\r\nassist the housekeeper in nursing her father: she was moved to do so by\r\na sense of duty as well as by the knowledge that Alfred Crowell would\r\ncome out as soon as he heard of the disaster, and he would expect to\r\nfind her there.\r\n\r\nIn the bustle and excitement of the first part of the day there was\r\nonly one person who thought much about Philip and of the effect this\r\nnew calamity might have upon him in his present state. As the afternoon\r\nadvanced, everybody was wondering why he neither came nor sent any\r\nmessage. The arrival of Pansy relieved Madge on this and other points;\r\nand she was happily spared for that night the pain of learning that\r\nPhilip did visit the gardener’s cottage without calling at Willowmere.\r\n\r\nPostman Zachy delivered two welcome letters in the cold gray light of\r\nthe winter morning. Both were from Austin Shield—one for Mrs Crawshay,\r\nthe other for Madge. The first simply stated that his old friend might\r\nexpect to see him in a few days, and that he believed she would have\r\nreason to give him the kindly greeting which he knew she would like to\r\ngive him. The second was longer and contained important information.\r\n\r\n‘Be patient and trust me still,’ it said. ‘You have fixed the week\r\nas the limit of your silence: before the time is out I shall be at\r\nWillowmere. Philip has acted in every way as I would have him act under\r\nthe circumstances, except in the extreme mercy which he extends to\r\nthe man Wrentham; but he pleads that it is for the sake of the poor\r\nlady and child whose happiness depends on the rascal, and I have been\r\nobliged to yield. At the last moment Wrentham attempted to escape, and\r\nwould have succeeded but for the cleverness of the detective, Sergeant\r\nDier.\r\n\r\n‘Be patient, and have courage till we meet again.’\r\n\r\n‘Be patient—have courage:’ excellent phrases and oftentimes helpful;\r\nbut was there ever any one who at a crisis in life has found the words\r\nalone satisfactory? They by no means relieved Madge of all uneasiness,\r\nalthough she accepted them as a token that her suspense would soon be\r\nat an end. In one respect she was keenly disappointed: there was not a\r\nhint that the proofs she had given Mr Shield of Mr Hadleigh’s innocence\r\nof any complicity in his misfortunes had been yet acknowledged to be\r\ncomplete. Had that been done, Philip would have forgotten half his\r\nworries. Mr Shield was aware of that—he must be aware of it, and yet he\r\nwas silent. She could not help thinking that there was some truth in Mr\r\nHadleigh’s view of the eccentricity of his character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW MEDIÆVAL ROOM AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the rooms at the British Museum, left vacant by the removal of\r\nthe Natural History Collection to South Kensington, has lately been\r\nre-opened, under the title of the Mediæval Room, with a collection\r\nof curious objects, many of which possess strong personal as well as\r\nantiquarian interest. The articles shown range from the twelfth century\r\ndownwards. Some of them have already been on exhibition in another part\r\nof the building; but the majority are now publicly shown for the first\r\ntime. The various items have been carefully arranged and labelled by\r\nMessrs Franks and Read, the curators of the Ethnological Department,\r\nthe fullness of the appended descriptions more than compensating for\r\nthe temporary lack of a catalogue.\r\n\r\nAmong the curiosities of more modern date is a silver-mounted\r\npunch-bowl of Inveraray marble, formerly the property of the poet\r\nBurns, and presented by his widow to Alexander Cunningham. Not far\r\ndistant rests the Lochbuy brooch, a massive ornament four inches in\r\ndiameter, said to date from about the year 1500, and to have been\r\nfashioned out of silver found on the estate of Lochbuy, in Mull. Its\r\ncentre is a large crystal, surrounded by upright collets bearing\r\npearls of considerable size. It was long preserved as a sort of\r\nheirloom in the Lochbuy family, but passed out of it by the marriage\r\nof a female representative, and in course of time became part of the\r\nBernal Collection, whence it was acquired by the British Museum. Hard\r\nby it is a handsomely carved casket, made of the wood of Shakspeare’s\r\nmulberry tree, and presented in 1769, with the freedom of the town of\r\nStratford-on-Avon, to David Garrick. The majority of the exhibits,\r\nhowever, belong to very much earlier periods. There is a choice\r\ndisplay of horn and tortoiseshell snuff and tobacco boxes, two of\r\nthe latter—duplicates, save in some unimportant particulars—bearing\r\nthe arms of Sir Francis Drake, and the representation of a ship in\r\nfull sail. We are told that boxes of this same pattern are frequently\r\noffered to collectors as having been the personal property of the great\r\nadmiral; but an inscription on one of the specimens here exhibited\r\nshows that they were actually made by one John Obrisset in 1712.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary-looking piece of rock-crystal in one of the cases claims\r\nto be the veritable ‘show-stone’ or divining crystal of Dr Dee, the\r\ncelebrated astrologer and alchemist of Queen Elizabeth’s time. Dee’s\r\nown account of the origin of the show-stone was as follows. He declared\r\nthat one day in November 1582, while he was engaged in prayer, the\r\nangel Uriel appeared to him and presented him with a magic crystal,\r\nwhich had the quality, when steadfastly gazed into, of presenting\r\nvisions, and even of producing articulate sounds. These sights and\r\nsounds, however, were only perceptible to a person endowed with the\r\nproper mediumistic faculty. This the doctor himself unfortunately\r\nlacked; but such a person was soon found in one Edward Kelly, who\r\nwas engaged as the doctor’s assistant, and produced ‘revelations’\r\nwith Joseph-Smith-like facility. Indeed, his revelations had more\r\nthan one point in common with those of the Mormon apostle, for it is\r\nrecorded that on one occasion he received a divine command that he\r\nand the doctor should exchange wives, which edifying little family\r\narrangement was actually carried out, with much parade of prayer and\r\nreligious ceremonial. It seems probable that Dee really believed\r\nin the manifestations, and was himself the dupe of his unscrupulous\r\nassociate. Kelly was accustomed to describe what he saw and heard in\r\nthe magic crystal, and Dr Dee took notes of the mystic revelations.\r\nThese notes were, in 1659, collected and published in a folio volume\r\nby Dr Meric Casaubon, an eminent scholar of that day, who appears to\r\nhave believed that the revelations were really the work of spirits,\r\nthough of doubtful character. From these notes it would appear that\r\nDee was possessed of two, if not more, divining crystals of various\r\nsizes. After his death, a stone, said to be one of these, came into the\r\npossession of the Earl of Peterborough, and thence into that of Lady\r\nElizabeth Germaine. It subsequently fell into the hands of the then\r\nhead of the House of Argyll, by whose son, Lord Frederick Campbell,\r\nit was presented to Horace Walpole. For many years it formed part of\r\nthe Strawberry Hill Collection, and there was appended to the leather\r\ncase in which it was contained a manuscript note, in Walpole’s own\r\nhandwriting, describing it as ‘the black stone into which Dr Dee used\r\nto call his spirits,’ and recording the above facts respecting it. On\r\nthe dispersion of the Strawberry Hill Collection in 1842, the stone\r\nin question is said to have been purchased, at the price of thirteen\r\npounds, by Mr Smythe Pigott; and at the sale of that gentleman’s\r\nlibrary in 1853, to have passed into the hands of Lord Londesborough.\r\nAs to the later history of this particular stone, we have no\r\ninformation; but it is clearly not identical with the one in the\r\nBritish Museum. Horace Walpole’s is described as being a ‘black stone.’\r\nOthers add that it was in shape a flat disk, with a loop or handle,\r\nand it is generally believed to have been a highly polished piece\r\nof cannel coal. The one in the British Museum more nearly resembles\r\nthe descriptions given of Lady Blessington’s crystal, employed for\r\na similar purpose by Lieutenant Morrison, the Zadkiel of ‘almanac’\r\ncelebrity. It is a ball, about two inches in diameter, of rather dark\r\nrock-crystal, and, as Mr Read informs us, has been in the possession of\r\nthe British Museum for nearly a century. Assuming, however, that, as\r\nstated in Casaubon’s notes, Dr Dee used two or more magic specula, this\r\nmay of course have been one of them.\r\n\r\nThis mystic crystal is appropriately flanked by a collection of\r\noriental talismans, some in metal, for suspension from the neck; others\r\nof agate or chalcedony, engraved with charms and cabalistic signs, for\r\nreproduction on wax or parchment. Here also are a couple of bezoar\r\nstones, formerly much esteemed as possessing occult medical virtues,\r\nparticularly as an antidote to poison. The genuine bezoar stone is a\r\ncalculus found in the stomach of the goat or antelope. The specimens\r\nhere shown are artificial, being compounded from a recipe in the\r\npossession of Sir Hans Sloane. They claim, however, to have all the\r\nvirtues of the genuine article, which we think extremely probable! They\r\nhave a peculiar aromatic smell, which probably assisted the belief in\r\ntheir hygienic properties.\r\n\r\nIn another of the cases we find post-mortem casts of the faces of\r\nCharles II. and Oliver Cromwell. A third, anonymous when acquired by\r\nthe Museum, has since been identified as that of Charles XII., king of\r\nSweden. The musket-wound in the temple, by which he fell, is plainly\r\nobservable. Not far distant are a leathern ‘black-jack’ and a couple\r\nof ‘chopines,’ the latter, however, not being, as French scholars\r\nmight be inclined to suppose, the measure of that name, but a sort of\r\nstilt about sixteen inches in height, with a shoe at the upper end,\r\nand formerly worn by the Venetian ladies. Shakspeare alludes to this\r\nqueer article where he makes Hamlet say, addressing one of the female\r\nplayers, ‘By’r Lady, your ladyship is nearer heaven than when I saw\r\nyou last, by the altitude of a chopine.’ Here, too, are a couple of\r\nthe mallets and a ball used in the old game of pall-mall. The present\r\nspecimens were found in the house of Mr Vulliamy, situated in the\r\nstreet of the same name, which adjoins the ancient Mall. The ball is of\r\nwood, about two and a half inches in diameter; and the mallets, save\r\nthat their heads are bound with iron, are almost precisely similar to\r\nthose used in croquet at the present day.\r\n\r\nThere are sundry curious ivories, among them being a drinking-horn made\r\nout of a single tusk, elaborately carved, and mounted with copper-gilt.\r\nIt bears the inscription:\r\n\r\n    Drinke you this, and thinke no scorne\r\n    Although the cup be much like a horne.\r\n\r\nIt bears the date 1599, and is in general appearance like a fish, with\r\na sort of scoop, or spoon-bowl, projecting from the mouth. There are\r\nindications that it was originally fashioned as a horn for blowing, but\r\nwas afterwards converted to its present purpose. A small tablet of the\r\nsame material represents ‘Orator’ Henley preaching. On the floor in the\r\ncentre of the building, presumably Henley’s chapel in Lincoln’s Inn\r\nFields, is seen an inscription indicating that the notorious Colonel\r\nCharteris lies buried there. Immediately in front of the preacher\r\nstands a bear on his hind-legs, holding a staff; and the congregation\r\nare represented with horns, exaggerated noses, heads of animals, and\r\nother deformities. The preacher appears to be uttering the words, ‘Let\r\nthose not calumniate who cannot confute.’\r\n\r\nIn another part of the room is a choice collection of ancient watches,\r\npocket dials, and timepieces of various descriptions, some of very\r\neccentric character. There are oval watches, octagon watches, and\r\ncruciform watches; watches in the form of tulips and other flowers.\r\nThere is a dial in the form of a star, and another in the shape of\r\na lute. A gilt clock, of considerable size, in the form of a ship,\r\nwith elaborate mechanical movements, is said to have been made for\r\nthe Emperor Rudolf II. A pocket dial shown has a special interest, as\r\nhaving belonged to Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, some time favourite\r\nof Queen Elizabeth. This dial bears the arms of the ill-fated earl,\r\ntogether with an inscription showing that it was made by one James\r\nKynvyn, in 1593.\r\n\r\nAstrolabes, nocturnals, and other astronomical instruments, English\r\nand foreign, are largely represented. There are ancient chess and\r\nbackgammon boards, with men carved or stamped in divers quaint\r\nfashions; and a number of drinking-cups in bronze, rock-crystal, and\r\nsilver, among those of the last material being a small goblet of\r\ngraceful fashion long known as the ‘Cellini’ cup, but believed to be\r\nin truth of German workmanship. An elegant tazza of rock-crystal,\r\nmounted with silver-gilt, has a medallion portrait of Queen Elizabeth\r\nin its centre; but whether it actually belonged to the Virgin Queen is\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nThe connoisseur in enamels will here find a large and varied\r\ncollection, ranging from the _cloisonné_ of the Byzantine to the _champ\r\nlevé_ of the early Limoges school, and the surface-painting of later\r\nartists. Some of the specimens shown are extremely beautiful; indeed,\r\nthis collection alone would well repay the trouble of a visit. One of\r\nthe earlier specimens, a plate of German enamel, represents Henry of\r\nBlois, Bishop of Winchester, and brother to King Stephen. Among the\r\nmore curious specimens of this ancient art are sundry bishops’ crosiers\r\nof various dates, and a couple of ‘pricket’ candlesticks, in which the\r\ncandle, instead of being dropped into a socket in the modern manner, is\r\nimpaled upon an upright point.\r\n\r\nA small _pietà_ of the sixteenth century, placed in one corner of the\r\nroom, deserves a special mention. The figures are in wax, skilfully\r\ndraped with real silk and lace. Such a combination has usually a tawdry\r\nappearance, but it has no such effect in this instance. The name of\r\nthe modeller has not been handed down to us, but he was unquestionably\r\na true artist. The look of death on the Saviour’s face, and the\r\nheart-broken expression of the Madonna as she bends over to kiss\r\nhis blood-stained brow, are almost painfully real. The power of the\r\nrepresentation is the more remarkable from its small size, the whole\r\ngroup being only about eight inches square.\r\n\r\nIn a collection numbering many hundreds of items, it is obviously\r\nimpossible even to mention more than a very small proportion of the\r\nwhole. We have spoken more particularly of such as have some personal\r\nor historical association connected with them; but on the score of\r\nantiquity alone, such a collection as this must be full of interest\r\nto thoughtful minds. Who can gaze upon these relics of the distant\r\npast without yearning to look back into the far-off times when all\r\nthese things were new? What would we give to see, ‘in their habit\r\nas they lived,’ the men who fashioned these ancient timepieces, who\r\ndrank from these crystal cups, and played tric-trac on these quaint\r\nbackgammon boards? It needs but small imagination to call up Burns and\r\nhis boon-companions carousing around the marble punch-bowl, with ‘just\r\na wee drap in their e’e;’ but who shall name the knights who wore this\r\niron gauntlet or that _repoussé_ breastplate? Their ‘bones are dust,\r\ntheir good swords rust,’ and yet here is part of their ancient panoply,\r\nwell-nigh as perfect as when it left the armourer’s anvil four hundred\r\nyears ago. Truly, they did good work, these mediæval artificers. The\r\nstruggle for existence was not so intense; they did not hurry, as in\r\nthese high-pressure days. Believing, with old George Herbert, that\r\n‘we do it soon enough, if that we do be well,’ they wisely took their\r\ntime, caring little to do quick work, so long as they did good work.\r\nAnd so their handiwork remains, _monumentum ære perennius_, a standing\r\nmemorial of the good old time when ‘art was still religion,’ and labour\r\nwas noble, because the craftsman put his heart into his work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONE WOMAN’S HISTORY.\r\n\r\n_A NOVELETTE._\r\n\r\nBY T. W. SPEIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, Archie Ridsdale burst abruptly into the room.\r\n‘Here’s a pretty go!’ he exclaimed. ‘Read this, please, dear Madame De\r\nVigne,’ putting a telegram into her hand.\r\n\r\nMadame De Vigne took it and read: ‘“From Beck and Beck, Bedford Row,\r\nLondon.”’\r\n\r\n‘The guv’s lawyers,’ explained Archie.\r\n\r\n‘“To Archibald Ridsdale, _Palatine Hotel_, Windermere.—We are\r\ninstructed to request you to be at our office at ten A.M. to-morrow, to\r\nmeet Sir William Ridsdale.”’\r\n\r\nMora looked at him as she gave him back the telegram.\r\n\r\n‘The last train for town,’ said Archie, ‘leaves in twenty-five minutes.\r\nMy man is cramming a few things into a bag, and I must start for the\r\nstation at once.’\r\n\r\n‘Were you not aware that your father had arrived from the continent?’\r\n\r\n‘This is the first intimation I’ve had of it. You know how anxiously\r\nI’ve been expecting an answer to the second letter I wrote him nearly a\r\nmonth ago.’\r\n\r\n‘It would seem from the telegram that he prefers a personal interview.’\r\n\r\n‘I’m glad of it for some things. He has never refused me anything when\r\nI’ve had the chance of talking to him, and I don’t suppose he will\r\nrefuse what I shall undoubtedly ask him to-morrow.’\r\n\r\nMadame De Vigne shook her head. ‘You are far too sanguine. Sir William\r\nknows already what it is you want him to do. He knew it before,\r\nwhen—when’——\r\n\r\n‘When he sent Colonel Woodruffe as his plenipo. to negotiate terms with\r\nthe enemy—meaning you,’ said Archie, with a laugh. ‘A pretty ambassador\r\nthe colonel made!’\r\n\r\nMadame De Vigne, who had risen and was gazing out of the window again,\r\ndid not answer for a little while. At length she said: ‘Archie, while\r\nthere is yet time, before you see your father to-morrow, I beg of you\r\nonce more seriously to consider the position in which you will place\r\nyourself by refusing to break off your engagement with my sister. That\r\nSir William will sanction your marriage with Clarice, I do not for one\r\nmoment believe. What father in his position would?’\r\n\r\nArchie, when he burst into the room, had omitted to close the door\r\nbehind him. It was now pushed a little further open, and, unperceived\r\nby either of the others, Clarice, dressed for walking, stepped into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n‘Naturally, he must have far higher, far more ambitious views for his\r\nonly son,’ continued Madame De Vigne. ‘As the world goes, he would be\r\ngreatly to blame if he had not. So, Archie,’ she said, as she took both\r\nhis hands in hers, ‘when you leave us to-night, I wish you clearly\r\nto understand that you go away unfettered by a tie or engagement of\r\nany kind. You go away as free and untrammelled as you were that sunny\r\nafternoon when you first set eyes on my sister. I speak both for\r\nClarice and myself.’\r\n\r\nHere Clarice came quickly forward. ‘Yes—yes, dear Archie, that is so,’\r\nshe exclaimed. ‘You are free from this hour. I—I shall never cease to\r\nthink of you, but that won’t matter to any one but myself.’\r\n\r\n‘Upon my word, I’m very much obliged to both of you,’ answered Archie,\r\nwho was now holding a hand of each. ‘I don’t know whether to laugh or\r\nbe angry. A nice, low, mean opinion you must have formed of Archie\r\nRidsdale, if you think he’s the sort of fellow to act in the way you\r\nsuggest.’ Then turning to Clarice, he said: ‘Darling, when you first\r\ntold me that you loved me, you believed me to be a poor man—poor in\r\npocket and poor in prospects. That made no difference in your feelings\r\ntowards me. There was then no question of a rich father coming between\r\nus—and I vow that neither he nor any one else in the world _shall_ come\r\nbetween us! I love and honour my father as much as any son can do; but\r\nthis is one of those supreme questions which each man must decide for\r\nhimself.’\r\n\r\n‘I have said my say—the raven has croaked its croak,’ said Madame De\r\nVigne with a little shrug, as she crossed to the other side of the\r\nroom. ‘You are a wilful, headstrong boy, and I suppose you must be\r\nallowed to ruin yourself in your own way.’\r\n\r\n‘Ruin, indeed!’ exclaimed Archie as he drew Clarice to him. ‘I don’t\r\nin the least care who looks upon me as a ruin, so long as this sweet\r\nflower clings to me and twines its tendrils round my heart!’ And with\r\nthat he stooped and kissed the fair young face that was gazing so\r\nlovingly into his own.\r\n\r\n‘Ah—boys and girls—girls and boys—you are the same all the world over,’\r\nsaid Madame De Vigne with a sigh.\r\n\r\n‘And you won’t be able to go to the picnic to-morrow,’ remarked Clarice\r\nplaintively.\r\n\r\nNanette appeared. ‘The carriage is at the door, sir. The driver says he\r\nhas only just time to catch the train.’\r\n\r\n‘I’m going to the station, dear, to see Archie off,’ said Clarice to\r\nher sister.\r\n\r\n‘Good-bye—for a little while,’ said Archie, as he took Madame De\r\nVigne’s hand. ‘The moment I have any news, you shall hear from me; and\r\nin any case, you will see me back before we are many days older.’\r\n\r\n‘Good-bye—and good-bye. Above all things, don’t forget the love and\r\nobedience you owe your father, and remember—the moment you choose to\r\nclaim your freedom, it is yours.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, dear Madame De Vigne’——\r\n\r\nShe interrupted him with a slight gesture of her hand. ‘Do not think me\r\nhard—do not think me unkind. I have to remember that I am this girl’s\r\nsister and mother in one.’\r\n\r\n‘But’——\r\n\r\n‘Not another word.’ She took his head in both her hands and drew it\r\ntowards her, and kissed him on the forehead. ‘Bon voyage! Dieu vous\r\nprotège. The prayers of two women will go with you.’\r\n\r\nThere was a tear in Archie’s eye as he turned away. Nanette was\r\nstanding by the open door. A moment later, and the young people were\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nMadame De Vigne stepped out into the veranda and waved her handkerchief\r\nas the carriage drove off.\r\n\r\n‘He will marry her whether Sir William gives his consent or not,’ she\r\nmused. ‘He is in youth’s glad spring-tide, when the world is full of\r\nsunshine, and the dragons that beset the ways of life seem put there\r\nonly to be fought and overcome. Well—let me but see my darling’s\r\nhappiness assured, and I think that I can bear without murmuring\r\nwhatever Fate may have in store for myself.’ She stepped back into\r\nthe room, and as she did so, Nanette opened the door once more and\r\nannounced—‘Colonel Woodruffe.’\r\n\r\nA slight tremor shook Madame De Vigne from head to foot. She drew a\r\nlong breath, and advanced a step or two to meet the colonel as he\r\nentered the room.\r\n\r\n‘I told you that I should come,’ said Colonel Woodruffe, with a rich\r\nglow on his face as he went forward and held out his hand.\r\n\r\n‘And you are here,’ answered Madame De Vigne, who had suddenly turned\r\nvery pale.\r\n\r\n‘Did you not expect me?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ she answered, as for a moment she looked him full in the eyes.\r\n\r\nShe sat down on an ottoman, and the colonel drew up a chair a little\r\ndistance away. He was a tall, well-built, soldier-like man, some\r\nthirty-eight or forty years old.\r\n\r\n‘You know the purpose that has brought me?’ he asked.\r\n\r\n‘I have not forgotten.’\r\n\r\n‘Two months ago I had the temerity to ask you a certain question. I,\r\nwho had come to judge you, if needs were to condemn, had ended by\r\nlosing my heart to the only woman I had ever met who had power to\r\ndrag it out of my own safe keeping. You rejected my suit. I left you.\r\nTime went on, but I found it impossible to forget you. At length I\r\ndetermined again to put my fortune to the proof. It was a forlorn hope,\r\nbut I am an old soldier, and I would not despair. Once more I told you\r\nall that I had told you before; once more I put the same question to\r\nyou. This time you did not say No, but neither did you say Yes. To-day\r\nI have come for your answer.’ He drew his chair a little closer and\r\ntook one of her hands. ‘Mora, do not say that your answer to-day will\r\nbe the same as it was before—do not say that you can never learn to\r\ncare for me.’\r\n\r\nShe had listened with bent head and downcast eyes. She now disengaged\r\nher hand, rose, crossed to the window, and then came back. She was\r\nevidently much perturbed. ‘What shall I say? what shall I say?’ she\r\nasked half aloud.\r\n\r\nThe colonel overheard her and started to his feet. ‘Let me tell you\r\nwhat to say!’ he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe held up her hand. ‘One moment,’ she said. Then she motioned to him\r\nto be seated, and herself sat down again.\r\n\r\n‘Has it never occurred to you,’ she began, ‘to ask yourself how much or\r\nhow little you really know about the woman whom you are so desirous\r\nof making your wife? Three months ago you had not even learnt my name,\r\nand now—even now, how much more do you know respecting me and my\r\nantecedents than you knew the first day you met me?’\r\n\r\n‘I know that I love you. I ask to know nothing more.’\r\n\r\n‘You would take me upon trust?’\r\n\r\n‘Try me.’\r\n\r\nShe shook her head a little sadly. ‘It is not the way of the world.’\r\n\r\n‘This is a matter with which the world has nothing to do.’\r\n\r\n‘Colonel Woodruffe—I have a Past.’\r\n\r\n‘So have all of us who are no longer boys or girls.’\r\n\r\n‘It is only right that you should know the history of that Past.’\r\n\r\n‘Such knowledge could in nowise influence me. It is with the present\r\nand the future only that I have to do.’\r\n\r\n‘It is of the future that I am now thinking.’\r\n\r\n‘Pardon me if I scarcely follow you.’\r\n\r\n‘How shall I express to you what I wish to convey?’ She rose, crossed\r\nto the table, and taking up a book, began to turn its leaves carelessly\r\nover, evidently scarcely knowing what she was about. ‘If—if it so\r\nhappened that I were to accede to your wishes,’ she said—‘if, in short,\r\nI were to become your wife—and at some future time, by some strange\r\nchance, some incident or fact connected with my past life, of which\r\nyou knew nothing, and of which you had no previous suspicion, were to\r\ncome to your knowledge, would you not have a right to complain that I\r\nhad deceived you? that I had kept silence when I ought to have spoken?\r\nthat—that’——\r\n\r\n‘Mora—Mora, if this is all that stands between me and your love—between\r\nme and happiness, it is nothing—less than nothing! I vow to you’——\r\n\r\n‘Stay!’ she said, coming a step or two nearer to him. ‘Do not think\r\nthat I fail to appreciate your generosity or the chivalrous kindness\r\nwhich prompts you to speak as you do. But—I am thinking of myself as\r\nwell as of you. If such a thing as I have spoken of were to happen,\r\nalthough your affection for me might be in nowise changed thereby,\r\nwith what feelings should I afterwards regard myself? I should despise\r\nmyself, and justly so, to the last day of my life.’\r\n\r\n‘No—no! Believe me, you are fighting a shadow that has no substance\r\nbehind it. I tell you again, and I will tell you so a hundred times,\r\nif need be, that with your Past I have nothing whatever to do. My\r\nheart tells me in accents not to be mistaken that you are a pure and\r\nnoble-minded woman. What need a man care to know more?’\r\n\r\n‘I should fail to be all that you believe me to be, were I not to\r\noppose you in this matter even against your own wishes.’\r\n\r\n‘Do you not believe in me? Can you not trust me?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, yes—yes! I believe in you, and trust you as only a woman can\r\nbelieve and trust. It is the unknown future and what may be hidden\r\nin it, that I dread.’ She crossed to the chimney-piece, took up the\r\nletter, gazed at it for a moment, and then went back with it in her\r\nhand. ‘Since you were here five days ago, I have written this—written\r\nit for you to read. It is the life-history of a most unhappy woman. It\r\nis a story that till now has been a secret between the dead and myself.\r\nBut to you it must now be told, because—because—oh! you know why. Take\r\nit—read it; and if after that you choose to come to me—then’——\r\n\r\nNot a word more could she say. She put the letter into his hand, and\r\nturning abruptly away, crossed to the window, but she saw nothing for\r\nthe blinding mist of tears that filled her eyes.\r\n\r\nColonel Woodruffe, with his gaze fixed on the letter, stood for a\r\nmoment or two turning it over and over in his fingers. Then he crossed\r\nto the fireplace. In a stand on the chimney-piece were some vesta\r\nmatches. He took one, lighted it, and with it set fire to the letter,\r\nwhich he held by one corner till it was consumed. Madame De Vigne had\r\nturned and was watching him with wide-staring eyes.\r\n\r\n‘“Let the dead Past bury its dead,”’ said the colonel gravely, as the\r\nashes dropped from his fingers into the grate. ‘Your secret shall\r\nremain a secret still.’\r\n\r\n‘’Tis done! I can struggle no longer,’ said Madame De Vigne to herself.\r\n\r\nThe colonel crossed to her and took one of her hands. ‘Nothing can come\r\nbetween us now,’ he said. ‘Now you are all my own.’\r\n\r\nHe drew her to him and touched her lips with his. All her face flushed\r\nrosy red, and into her eyes there sprang a light of love and tenderness\r\nsuch as he had never seen in them before. Never had he seen her look\r\nso beautiful as at that moment. He led her back to the ottoman and sat\r\ndown beside her.\r\n\r\n‘Tell me, dearest,’ he said, ‘am I the same man who came into this room\r\na quarter of an hour ago—doubting, fearing, almost despairing?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, the same.’\r\n\r\n‘I began to be afraid that I had been changed into somebody else. Well,\r\nnow that the skirmish is over, now that the fortress has capitulated,\r\nsuppose we settle the terms of victory. How soon are we to be married?’\r\n\r\n‘Married! You take my breath away. You might be one of those\r\nfreebooters of the middle ages who used to hang their prisoners the\r\nmoment they caught them.’\r\n\r\n‘We are prepared to grant the prisoner a reasonable time to make her\r\npeace with the world.’\r\n\r\nMadame De Vigne laid a hand gently on his sleeve. ‘Dear friend, let us\r\ntalk of this another time,’ she said.\r\n\r\n‘Another time then let it be,’ he answered as he lifted her hand to his\r\nlips. ‘Meanwhile’——\r\n\r\n‘Yes, meanwhile?’\r\n\r\n‘I may as well proceed to give you a few lessons in the art of making\r\nlove.’\r\n\r\n‘It may be that the pupil knows as much of such matters as her teacher.’\r\n\r\n‘That has to be proved. You shall have your first lesson to-morrow.’\r\n\r\n‘Merci, monsieur.’\r\n\r\n‘By Jove! talking about to-morrow reminds me of something I had nearly\r\nforgotten.’ He started to his feet and pulled out his watch. ‘Now that\r\nyou have made me the happiest fellow in England, I must leave you for a\r\nlittle while.’\r\n\r\n‘Leave me?’ she exclaimed as she rose to her feet.\r\n\r\n‘Only for a few hours. On my arrival here I found a telegram from my\r\nbrother. He has been staying at Derwent Hall, near Grasmere. To-morrow\r\nhe starts for Ireland. We have some family matters to arrange. If I\r\ndon’t see him to-night, we may not meet again for months. I’m sorry at\r\nhaving to go, but you won’t mind my leaving you till to-morrow?’\r\n\r\n‘Can you ask? Do you know, I’m rather glad you are going.’\r\n\r\n‘Why glad?’\r\n\r\n‘Because it will give me time to think over all that has happened this\r\nevening. I—I feel as if I want to be alone. You are not a woman, and\r\ncan’t understand such things.’\r\n\r\nAgain his arm stole round her waist. The clock on the mantel-piece\r\nstruck the hour. Mora disengaged herself. ‘Twilight seems to have come\r\nall at once,’ she said. ‘You will have a dark drive. It is time for you\r\nto go.’\r\n\r\n‘More’s the pity.’\r\n\r\n‘To-morrow will soon be here; which reminds me that we have arranged\r\nfor a picnic to-morrow at High Ghyll Force.’\r\n\r\n‘You will be there?’\r\n\r\n‘Clarice and Miss Gaisford have induced me to promise.’\r\n\r\n‘If I should happen to drive round that way on my return, should I be\r\nlooked upon as an intruder?’\r\n\r\n‘As if you didn’t know differently from that!’\r\n\r\n‘Then possibly you may see me.’\r\n\r\n‘I shall expect you without fail.’\r\n\r\n‘In that case I will not fail.—My driver will be wondering what has\r\nbecome of me.’\r\n\r\n‘Good-night,’ said Mora impulsively.\r\n\r\n‘Harold,’ he said softly.\r\n\r\n‘Harold—dear Harold!’ she answered.\r\n\r\n‘My name never sounded so sweet before,’ exclaimed the colonel as, with\r\na parting embrace, the gallant wooer quitted the apartment.\r\n\r\n‘Heaven bless you, my dearest one!’ she murmured as the door closed.\r\nThen she sank on to a seat and wept silently to herself for several\r\nminutes. After a time she proceeded to dry her eyes. ‘What bundles of\r\ncontradictions we women are! We cry when we are in trouble, and we cry\r\nwhen we are glad.’\r\n\r\nNanette came in, carrying a lighted lamp. She was about to close the\r\nwindows and draw the curtains, but her mistress stopped her. After the\r\nhot day, the evening seemed too fresh and beautiful to be shut out.\r\nNanette turned down the flame of the lamp till it seemed little more\r\nthan a glowworm in the dusk, and then left the room.\r\n\r\n‘How lonely I feel, now that he has gone,’ said Mora; ‘but to-morrow\r\nwill bring him again—to-morrow!’\r\n\r\nShe crossed to the piano and struck a few notes in a minor key. Then\r\nshe rose and went to the window. ‘Music has no charms for me to-night,’\r\nshe said. ‘I cannot read—I cannot work—I cannot do anything. What\r\nstrange restlessness is this that possesses me?’ There was a canary in\r\na cage hanging near the window. It chirruped to her as if wishful of\r\nbeing noticed. ‘Ah, my pretty Dick,’ she said, ‘you are always happy so\r\nlong as you have plenty of seed and water. I can whisper my secret to\r\nyou, and you will never tell it again, will you? Dick—he loves me—he\r\nloves me—he loves me! And I love him, oh, so dearly, Dick!’\r\n\r\nShe went back to the piano and played a few bars; but being still beset\r\nby the same feeling of restlessness, she presently found her way again\r\nto the window. On the lawn outside, the dusk was deepening. The trees\r\nstood out massive and solemn against the evening sky, but the more\r\ndistant features of the landscape were lost in obscurity. How lonely\r\nit seemed! There was not a sound anywhere. Doubtless, several windows\r\nof the hotel were lighted up, but from where Mora was standing they\r\nwere not visible. Dinner was still in progress; as soon as it should\r\nbe over, the lawn would become alive with figures, idling, flirting,\r\nsmoking, seated under the trees, or promenading slowly to and fro.\r\nAt present, however, the lady had the whole solemn, lovely scene to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nShe stood gazing out of the window for some minutes without moving,\r\nlooking in her white dress in the evening dusk like a statue chiselled\r\nout of snowy marble.\r\n\r\n‘My heart ought to beat with happiness,’ she inwardly communed; ‘but it\r\nis filled with a vague dread of something—I know not what—a fear that\r\nhas no name. Yet what have I to fear? Nothing—nothing! My secret is\r\nstill my own, and the grave tells no tales.’\r\n\r\nSuddenly a breath of air swept up from the lake and shook the curtains.\r\nShe looked round the dim room with a shudder. The tiny tongue of flame\r\nfrom the lamp only served, as it were, to make darkness visible. She\r\nmade a step forward, and then drew back. The room seemed full of\r\nweird shadows. Was there not something in that corner? It was like a\r\ncrouching figure, all in black, waiting to spring upon her! And that\r\ncurtain—it seemed as if grasped by a hidden hand! What if some one were\r\nhiding there!\r\n\r\nShe sank into the nearest chair and pressed her fingers to her eyes.\r\n‘No—no—no!’ she murmured. ‘These are only my own foolish imaginings. O\r\nHarold, Harold! why did you leave me?’\r\n\r\nNext moment the silence was broken by the faint, far-away sound of a\r\nhorn, playing a slow, sweet air. Mora lifted her head and listened.\r\n\r\n‘Music on the lake. How sweet it sounds. It has broken the spell that\r\nheld me. It seems like the voice of a friend calling through the\r\ndarkness. I will walk down to the edge of the water. The cool air from\r\nthe hills will do me good.’\r\n\r\nThere was a black lace scarf hanging over the arm of a couch; she took\r\nit up and draped it over her head and round her throat and shoulders.\r\nHer foot was on the threshold, she was in the act of stepping out into\r\nthe veranda, when she heard a voice outside speaking to some other\r\nperson. The instant she heard it she shrank back as though petrified\r\nwith horror.\r\n\r\n‘That voice! Can the grave give up its dead?’ she whispered as though\r\nshe were asking the question of some one.\r\n\r\nNext moment the figures of two men, one walking a little way behind\r\nthe other, became distinctly outlined against the evening sky as they\r\nadvanced up the sloping pathway from the lake. The first of the two men\r\nwas smoking, the second was carrying some articles of luggage.\r\n\r\nThe first man came to a halt nearly opposite the windows of Madame\r\nde Vigne’s sitting-room. Turning to the second man, he said, with a\r\npronounced French accent: ‘Take my luggage into the hotel. I will stay\r\nhere a little while and smoke.’\r\n\r\nThe second man passed forward out of sight. The first man, still\r\nstanding on the same spot, took out another cigar, struck a match,\r\nand proceeded to light it. For a moment by the light of the match his\r\nfeatures were plainly visible; next moment all was darkness again.\r\n\r\nBut Madame De Vigne, crouching behind the curtains of the dimly lighted\r\nroom, had seen enough to cause her heart to die within her.\r\n\r\n‘The grave _has_ given up its dead! It is he!’ her blanched lips\r\nmurmured.\r\n\r\nSome minutes later, Clarice Loraine, on going into the sitting-room,\r\nfound her sister on the floor in a dead faint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EDUCATIONAL PIONEER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to find a more unique or more interesting\r\neducational body than the so-called Brothers of the Christian Schools.\r\nFounded some two hundred years ago by the venerable John Baptist de la\r\nSalle, on lines which the best schools of to-day have not hesitated\r\nto adopt, the influence of this Institute has spread over all the\r\ncivilised, and even to some regions of the uncivilised world. Its\r\nextension to Great Britain is but of recent date, and only seven\r\nschools have as yet been inaugurated. The thoroughness and practical\r\nvalue of the instruction given are mainly due to a strict adherence to\r\nthe ‘object’ lesson principle.\r\n\r\nHitherto, we have been accustomed to associate this with the\r\nKindergarten ideas of Pestalozzi and Froebel; but although their\r\nefforts to lighten the intellectual labours of the young were mainly\r\ninstrumental in bringing ‘playwork’ to its present perfection,\r\nrecent researches have shown that the venerable Dr de la Salle in\r\nhis educational plan strongly urged that pupils should be taken to\r\nexhibitions and so forth, where their masters could give practical\r\nillustrations of special studies. Zoological or botanical gardens\r\nwere in this way to be visited, that the uses and benefits of certain\r\nanimals or plants might be demonstrated; and school museums, herbaria,\r\ngeological, mineralogical, and other collections were afterwards to be\r\nformed by the pupils themselves. And not only did De la Salle institute\r\nobject-teaching, but he was also the first to introduce class methods.\r\nBefore his time, children were for the most part taught individually,\r\nor, where this was not so, large numbers were collected in one room,\r\neach in turn going to the teacher to have separate instruction, whilst\r\nthe others were allowed to remain idle, free to torment one another or\r\nthe little victim at the master’s table. Great care was taken by De la\r\nSalle in examining and placing the children committed to his care in\r\nthe classes best fitted for them; and the success of his method was\r\nso great, that the numerous schools opened by the Brothers under his\r\ndirection soon became overcrowded.\r\n\r\nHis great object was to reach the poor, and to train them to a\r\nknowledge of a holy life and an independent livelihood. The opposition\r\nhe met with was at times very great. The ire of professional\r\nwriting-masters was first aroused; the poor had necessarily been\r\ndebarred from learning to write, because only the well-to-do could\r\nafford the stipulated fees, and writing-masters were therefore employed\r\nto do all the correspondence of those who could not write. So, when De\r\nla Salle undertook to teach every child who came to him what had been\r\nin some senses a secret art, their fury vented itself in an opposition\r\nso overpowering that they drove the Brothers from their schools in\r\nParis and threw their furniture into the streets. The opposition was\r\nonly temporary, however; and as time passed, fresh schools were opened,\r\nnot only in France and her colonies, but in every European country, and\r\nmany parts of America, as well as in one or two districts of Asia and\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nThe Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, though\r\nnominally Roman Catholic, is truly catholic in its widest sense, for,\r\nbesides admitting children of every religious denomination, secular\r\nlearning is admirably provided for. Their greatest successes have\r\nperhaps been achieved in the art of writing and drawing, as applied\r\nto all technical industries and art products. One illustration of the\r\nresults of their method of teaching writing in a remote region where\r\nthe pupils are not the easiest to train, may be cited as an example.\r\nWhen the treaty of commerce between France and Madagascar in 1868 was\r\nabout to be signed, Queen Ranavalona was much struck by the beautiful\r\ncaligraphy of the copy presented to her by the Chancellor of the French\r\nConsulate, and she determined that hers should not be inferior. The\r\npupils in all the chief schools in the island furnished examples of\r\nhandwriting to the queen’s prime-minister, but without satisfying her\r\ntaste. At last, an officer who had seen the Brothers’ schools suggested\r\nthat one of their pupils should compete. A young boy, Marc Rabily-Kely,\r\nsent in some beautiful specimens of different styles of writing; and\r\nthe copying of the treaty was at once intrusted to him. When the two\r\ncopies were presented side by side, a murmur of applause went round\r\nat the sight of Queen Ranavalona’s copy, and all cried out: ‘Resy ny\r\nvasoha’ (The whites are beaten). This is only one instance among many,\r\nand shows how much can be done by systematic training in the art of\r\nwriting, a subject much neglected in the majority of schools.\r\n\r\nBut De la Salle did not stop short at educating the poor; he was\r\nthe first to found training colleges for masters, and the first to\r\ninstitute regular boarding-schools in which everything relating to\r\ncommerce, finance, military engineering, architecture, and mathematics\r\nwas taught, and in which trades could be learned. Besides these, he\r\nfounded an institution in which agriculture was taught as a science.\r\nAt St Yon, where the first agricultural school was started, a large\r\ngarden was devoted to the culture of specimens of fodder-plants,\r\ninjurious plants, grain, plants peculiar to certain soils, fruits and\r\nflowers. The students of to-day study all this, and in addition to\r\nworking on model farms, visit all the best farms around, are sent with\r\nspecial professors to attend certain markets and sales of live-stock,\r\nand have special field-days for practically studying botany, geology,\r\nand entomology. The innovations introduced by De la Salle extended\r\nto other matters than practical education. Before French boys in his\r\nday were allowed to study their own language, they were obliged to\r\nlearn to read Latin, and thus years were sometimes spent in acquiring\r\na certain facility in reading a language they never understood. De la\r\nSalle changed all this, in spite of repeated opposition, and succeeded\r\nin making the vernacular tongue the basis of their teaching instead of\r\nLatin. Owing to this change, the poor scholars progressed much more\r\nrapidly than those in other schools, and the Brothers’ Institutes were\r\nsoon far ahead of all the elementary schools of their day. The way in\r\nwhich they have held their position even till to-day is shown by the\r\nresults of the public examinations in Paris during the last thirty-five\r\nyears. Out of sixteen hundred and thirty-five scholarships offered\r\nduring this time, pupils of these schools have obtained thirteen\r\nhundred and sixteen. This in itself is an enormous proportion; but\r\nit is even greater than it appears, when we consider that seculars\r\nhad more schools, fewer pupils per teacher, and thus a better chance\r\nto advance the individual scholar, and as a rule, a richer class of\r\nscholars to select from. These scholarship examinations have recently\r\nbeen discontinued, though not until after the Brothers’ pupils were\r\nexcluded from competition in consequence of the so-called ‘laicisation’\r\nof schools in 1880, after which the Brothers of Paris gave up their\r\ngovernment schools and opened voluntary ones.\r\n\r\nThe whole educational scheme of De la Salle was admirably complete;\r\nbut perhaps the most interesting feature of the whole—now that we\r\nare familiarised with his systems for teaching special subjects by\r\ntheir spread in their original or a modified form to most European\r\ncountries—was his very simple plan for enforcing discipline. He was\r\nalways loath to believe unfavourable accounts of any pupil, and in\r\nthe first place took pains to discover whether the failings were the\r\nresult of the misdirection of those in authority or of the pupil’s\r\nown wilfulness. When there was evidently a necessity for punishment,\r\nthe culprit was put in a quiet and fairly comfortable cell. Once shut\r\nin alone, his notice was attracted to stands obviously intended for\r\nflowers, to empty cages and other things which reminded the little\r\nprisoner that there were good and beautiful enjoyments for those who\r\ndeserved them. One of the first questions the boys generally asked\r\nwas why there were nails for pictures, cages for birds, &c., and yet\r\nneither pictures nor birds. In answer, they were told that as they\r\nimproved they would be supplied with all these good things; that if\r\nthey left off using profane or bad language, a bird would be put in the\r\ncage; that as soon as they became industrious and worked well, their\r\nprison vases would be adorned with flowers; that when they acknowledged\r\ntheir previous wrong-doing, pleasant pictures would be hung on the\r\npanels; that when their repentance was seen to be sincere, they would\r\nrejoin their schoolfellows; and that in time they would be allowed to\r\ngo back to their families.\r\n\r\nThe system worked so well, and is still found to succeed so thoroughly,\r\nthat it is almost a wonder it has not become more general. It has\r\ncertainly many advantages over the plan of giving boys so many hundred\r\nlines to write, which is a mere task, soon forgotten, and benefiting\r\nno one. But as there are only seven schools, and those of very recent\r\nfoundation, in England, we may perhaps still have to wait before\r\nhearing that this discipline is at all general. In the meantime, all\r\ninterested in the training of the young might derive valuable hints\r\nfrom studying this and other methods initiated by the pioneer of\r\npopular education not only in France, but in all Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MISSING CLUE.\r\n\r\nA TALE OF THE FENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.—THE ARRIVAL AT THE ‘SAXONFORD ARMS.’\r\n\r\nIf any misanthropic subject of His Most Gracious Majesty King George\r\nII. had wished to withdraw himself from the bustle of public life and\r\nturn recluse in real good earnest, he could scarcely have chosen a\r\ndistrict more likely to suit his retiring taste than the country in the\r\nvicinity of Saxonford. Scarcely aspiring to the dignity of a village,\r\nthe place so named was merely a cluster of cottages formed upon the\r\nedge of a rough highway leading apparently to nowhere. In ancient\r\ntimes this spot had been of somewhat more importance, for it was here\r\nthat a religious house of no inconsiderable size had flourished. But\r\nthose days had long passed away; and in 1745 the only remnant of the\r\nmonastery which survived the depredations committed by man and the\r\nall-effacing hand of Time was a gray skeleton tower, a silent witness\r\nto its departed conventual magnificence. Being erected, as was usually\r\nthe case with fen settlements, upon a rise of comparatively high land,\r\nthe remains commanded a view of an almost unbroken horizon. Standing\r\nat some distance from the hamlet which had arisen round the monastic\r\nruin was a quaint dilapidated structure, known to the scattered natives\r\nof those parts as the _Saxonford Arms_. Whatever might have been the\r\ncauses that induced the architect to build such an inn—for it was\r\nby no means a small one—in so lonely a part, must remain a matter\r\nof conjecture. A visitor was almost unknown at the old inn. There\r\nit stood, weather-beaten and time-worn as the gray old tower which\r\noverlooked it, and much more likely to tumble down, if the truth be\r\ntold.\r\n\r\nAt the time we speak of, the scene appeared unusually calm and\r\nbeautiful, for the day was drawing to an end, and it was close upon\r\nsunset, a period which is seldom seen to so much advantage as in the\r\nlow-lying districts of the fens. The weather had been unusually hot,\r\nand the sinking sun shed a warm glow over a tract of well-browned\r\ncountry, making its rich hues seem richer still. In the glassy water of\r\nthe river, the vivid sky was reflected as in a mirror, while the tall\r\ntops of the sedge-rushes that bordered it were scarcely stirred by a\r\nbreath of air. A rotten timber bridge, which might have been erected in\r\nthe time of Hereward, spanned the stream at a short distance from the\r\nold inn; crossing this, the road dipped down and led the way between\r\npatches of black peat, cultivated land, and unreclaimed watery morass,\r\nstraight towards the south.\r\n\r\nA small party of strong sunburnt fen labourers were seated on the rough\r\nbenches in front of mine host’s ancient house of entertainment, some of\r\nthem swarthy, black-bearded men, others with light tawny hair and blue\r\neyes. True types of the hardy race were they; their strong, uncovered\r\nbrown arms, which had all day long been working under a baking sun,\r\nupon a shadeless flat, telling a tale of sinewy power that came not a\r\njot under the renowned strength of their mighty ancestors. Mine host\r\nhimself, a ruddy-faced man of middle age, was there too, smoking a long\r\nwell-coloured pipe, and gazing in a thoughtful way across the long\r\nstretch of fen, over which the shades of night were steadily creeping.\r\n\r\n‘What be ye gaping at, master?’ quoth one of the brawny labourers, as\r\nthe landlord shaded his eyes with his hand and endeavoured to make out\r\nsome indistinct object.\r\n\r\n‘What’re ye looking after, Hobb?’ asked another one in a bantering\r\ntone. ‘Can’t ye believe your own eyes, man?’\r\n\r\n‘Nay, Swenson, I can’t,’ returned mine host, lowering his hand and\r\nturning to the person who addressed him. ‘I want a good pair sadly.’\r\n\r\n‘You’re like to get ’em staring over the fen in that way, my boy!’\r\nremarked Swenson with a hoarse laugh.\r\n\r\n‘Lend me your eyes here, Harold,’ went on the innkeeper. ‘Take a squint\r\nacross that bank and tell me what you see.’\r\n\r\n‘What be the good o’ askin’ me?’ returned the man. ‘I can’t tell a\r\nbarn-door from a peat-stack at fifty yards’ distance.’\r\n\r\n‘I’ll tell ye, Dipping,’ cried a young sunburnt giant, starting up from\r\nthe bench on which he had been sitting. ‘Where is’t?’\r\n\r\n‘You see yon tall willow?’\r\n\r\n‘Him as sticks up there by the dike?’\r\n\r\n‘Ay. Look out there to the left o’ it, across the fen, and tell me what\r\nye see.’\r\n\r\nThe fellow’s blue eyes were directed with an earnest gaze towards the\r\ndistant spot which the landlord pointed out; and then he turned sharply\r\nround and exclaimed: ‘It be two horsemen.’\r\n\r\n‘Are ye sure?’ asked mine host, as he bent his brows and vainly tried\r\nto make out the far-off speck.\r\n\r\n‘Quite sure,’ was the reply. ‘They’re coming up the road by the old\r\nNorth Lode.—There; now they’re passing One Man’s Mill.’\r\n\r\n‘I see ’em!’ exclaimed Swenson, pointing towards a solitary windmill,\r\nthe jagged sails of which formed a slight break in the long line of\r\nmisty flatness.\r\n\r\n‘Perchance they be travellers, and will want beds for the night,’ said\r\nmine host, roused to action by the mere possibility of such an event\r\noccurring. ‘I will see that the place is got ready for them.’\r\n\r\n‘Hobb Dipping is soon counting his chickens,’ remarked one of the\r\nuncouth fenmen, laughing, as the landlord of the _Saxonford Arms_\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n‘Ay, it’s like him all over,’ rejoined Swenson, while he gathered up\r\nsome implements and prepared to go.—‘Are ye coming with me, Harold?’\r\n\r\n‘No, my boy; I’m agoing to stop and see who yon horsemen may be. News\r\nare scarce in these parts. If you’re off now, why, good-night to ye.’\r\n\r\nSwenson nods, bids the man good-night, and then strides off in the\r\ndirection of the old gray tower. The major part of the loiterers go\r\nwith him; but three or four still linger, looking along the misty road,\r\nand waiting as if in expectation of something.\r\n\r\nA light up in one of the windows of the inn tells that Hobb Dipping\r\nis preparing his best room for the reception of the approaching\r\ntravellers, in case it should be needed; and a savoury smell of hot\r\nmeat which issues forth through the open doorway of the hostel makes\r\nthe few hungry watchers that remain feel inclined to seek their own\r\nsupper-tables. At length mine host has finished his task, and the most\r\npresentable apartment that the house contains is ready for instant\r\noccupation if necessary. Honest Hobb Dipping gazes wistfully out of a\r\nrickety diamond-paned window, and thinks that his labour must have been\r\nin vain. The moon is rising from the shadow of a thick bank of vapour,\r\nits dim red outline as yet but faintly seen through the misty cloud.\r\nIt is getting late; the travellers must have passed by the bridge, and\r\nridden along the flood-bank. ‘If they know not the way well,’ mutters\r\nDipping to himself, ‘they’ll lose themselves in the fen for certain. An\r\nawkward path that be, specially binight, with a damp fog rising.’\r\n\r\nAt this moment, a clatter of horses’ hoofs breaks the silence, and\r\ntwo horsemen canter over the shaky timber bridge and draw up in front\r\nof the old inn. Mine host bustles about shouting a number of confused\r\ndirections; the one youthful domestic which the place boasts of running\r\nhelplessly to and fro and doing nothing. The foremost rider, suddenly\r\nleaping from his horse, strides into the inn, and flings himself into a\r\nchair, ordering a private room and supper to be made ready at once.\r\n\r\nHonest Dipping hurries about, unused to strangers of distinction,\r\nbringing in liquor and glasses, meat, platters and knives, besides a\r\nquantity of other things that are not wanted, the stranger meanwhile\r\nhaving taken possession of the room up-stairs which had been hurriedly\r\nprepared for him.\r\n\r\nPresently follows the gentleman’s servant, a short muscular fellow,\r\nwith a sullen, lowering countenance; and a short conversation takes\r\nplace between the man and his master.\r\n\r\n‘Are the horses put up, Derrick?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, sir.’\r\n\r\n‘And the pistols?’\r\n\r\n‘Here they are, Sir Carnaby.’\r\n\r\n‘Loaded, of course?’\r\n\r\n‘Ay, sir, both of them.’\r\n\r\n‘Right! Now, what think you of this part? Is it not quiet enough for\r\nus? I never was in such a dead-alive wilderness before; and taking that\r\ninto consideration, I fancy it is possible to last out a few days even\r\nin this ghastly shanty. After that, I shall ride to Lynn and take ship,\r\nfor, as I live, the country is getting too hot to hold me.’\r\n\r\nDerrick gave vent to a sound resembling a grunt, and muttered a few\r\nwords containing seemingly some disparaging reference to the ‘king over\r\nthe water.’\r\n\r\n‘Hush, you fool!’ exclaimed his master in a low whisper; ‘you should\r\nknow better than to speak of what does not concern you. Be wise, and\r\nhold your tongue.’\r\n\r\n‘Your pardon, Sir Carnaby,’ replied Derrick; ‘it shall not be spoken of\r\nagain.’\r\n\r\n‘And mind, Derrick, in case we should be inquired after, let the rustic\r\nboors know that I am Mr Morton, a landowner from somewhere or other.\r\nYou, Derrick, are John Jones; so mind and answer to your name. D’ye\r\nhear?’\r\n\r\nThe attendant’s face relaxed into a sly grin as he answered: ‘I hear,\r\nsir.’\r\n\r\nThe truth is, Mr Morton—or to call him by his proper name, Sir\r\nCarnaby Vincent—was a young baronet of good family, and reputed to\r\nbe enormously rich. In consequence of his being mixed up in some\r\ndisturbances occasioned by the Jacobite party, he had found it\r\nnecessary, at a previous period, to avoid the cognisance of the\r\nauthorities. But a certain nobleman having interested himself in\r\nthe youthful plotter’s behalf, the affair was hushed up, and Sir\r\nCarnaby returned to society once more. Having a relish for all kinds\r\nof intrigue, besides being of too excitable a temperament to exist\r\nlong in a state of quiet, the madcap young fellow again entered heart\r\nand soul into the intrigues of Prince Charles’ followers, and this\r\ntime succeeded only too well in attracting notice. A warrant was\r\nissued for his apprehension; and Sir Carnaby once more had to seek\r\nsafety in flight, taking with him a quantity of valuable papers, and\r\nthe blessings of all his companions engaged in the perilous cause.\r\nHe was accompanied by only one person, his servant Derrick, a rough\r\nbut doggedly faithful retainer, who had followed the fortunes of his\r\nhouse for nearly thirty years. Derrick himself cared not a jot for the\r\nJacobite party to which Sir Carnaby was so attached; his first thought\r\nwas to follow his master, and share the dangers which he might have\r\nto encounter. Their retreat from the metropolis was safely effected,\r\nmuch to the satisfaction of the baronet, who was really seriously\r\nalarmed at this second unlucky discovery. From London they journeyed\r\nthrough Cambridgeshire, Sir Carnaby’s plan being to lie quiet for a\r\nfew days in the heart of the fens, then afterwards proceeding to some\r\nobscure seaport on the borders of the Wash, to take sail for a foreign\r\nland, where he could best forward the fortunes both of himself and his\r\nhapless Prince.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.—THE JACOBITE.\r\n\r\n‘Where did you place the saddle-bags, Derrick?’ asked Sir Carnaby, when\r\nHobb Dipping had quitted the old wainscoted apartment in which his\r\ndistinguished visitor was about to partake of supper.\r\n\r\nSpeech was a gift which nature had bestowed very sparingly upon the\r\nattendant; moreover, he was possessed of a rough, unmelodious voice.\r\nPointing towards a chair in one corner, he slowly ejaculated: ‘There,\r\nsir—underneath.’\r\n\r\n‘Good!’ said Sir Carnaby, seating himself at the table.—‘By the way,\r\nDerrick, I think it would be just as well to look after the innkeeper:\r\nhis glances are a trifle too curious to please me. When I have finished\r\nmy supper, you had better descend into the public room and try to\r\nascertain his opinion of us.’\r\n\r\n‘Right, sir,’ replied the attendant.\r\n\r\n‘Come from behind my chair, you varlet,’ said the baronet, motioning\r\nhim at the same time with his hand. ‘Draw up to the table and break\r\nyour fast with me; we shall gain time by so doing.’\r\n\r\nDerrick sat down respectfully at the farther end of the board, and\r\ngazed in a thoughtful way at a dark patch of sky which could be seen\r\nthrough the diamond-shaped panes of glass in a window opposite him.\r\n\r\n‘You seem in no hurry to refresh the inner man,’ remarked Sir Carnaby.\r\n‘What are you thinking of, Derrick?’\r\n\r\n‘A dream, sir.’\r\n\r\n‘A what?’\r\n\r\n‘A dream, sir,’ repeated Derrick—‘one I had last night.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, as your mind appears to be somewhat uneasy,’ remarked Sir\r\nCarnaby, with a slight smile playing over his features, ‘I should\r\nrecommend open confession as being the proper thing to relieve it.’\r\n\r\n‘There’s little enough to tell, sir,’ said Derrick; ‘’twas only a bit\r\nof dark sky up there that brought it back to me.’\r\n\r\n‘Well,’ said Sir Carnaby simply.\r\n\r\n‘It seemed to me,’ continued the attendant, ‘as if I was riding alone,\r\nholding your horse by the bridle. The moon was up, and the sky looked\r\nthe same as it does out there. I can remember now quite plain that I\r\nfelt kind of troubled, but what about, I know just as little as you,\r\nsir.’\r\n\r\n‘Is that the whole story?’ asked Sir Carnaby with a laugh. ‘Well, I\r\ncan tell you, good Derrick, so far as riding alone goes, your prophecy\r\nis likely to prove a true one, though I certainly don’t intend you to\r\ncarry off my horse with you.—See here; this is something more important\r\nthan a heavy-headed dream. You must start to-morrow for the Grange. Be\r\nin the saddle early, and don’t spare your spurs.’\r\n\r\n‘Am I to go alone, sir?’\r\n\r\n‘Certainly. The journey has no object beyond the delivery of this\r\nletter; and as inquiry is sure to be pretty rife concerning me, I shall\r\nstay where I am and await your return.’\r\n\r\nDerrick received the sealed envelope which was handed to him with a\r\ngruff but respectful ‘Right, sir,’ and then relapsed into his customary\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n‘I shall leave it to your discretion to find out the way,’ said Sir\r\nCarnaby. ‘Of course you will go armed?’\r\n\r\nThe attendant opened his coat without speaking and touched the hilt of\r\na stout hanger which he wore at his side.\r\n\r\nSir Carnaby smiled. ‘Yes,’ he said; ‘you are ready enough to play\r\nat blood-letting; but that sort of thing is best avoided. Let your\r\nmovements be as quiet and speedy as possible; and when you reach your\r\ndestination, seek out Captain Hollis by means of that address. Give the\r\nnote into his hands, then make haste back. I shall have other work for\r\nyou when you return.’\r\n\r\n‘More plots,’ thought Derrick, but he merely uttered a grunt and\r\npocketed the letter.\r\n\r\n‘This room,’ continued the baronet, ‘seems to be parlour and bedchamber\r\nin one. So far well. If there should be any occasion to consult me\r\nagain before you start, one rap at this door will be quite sufficient\r\nto wake me. I am a light sleeper.’\r\n\r\n‘Anything more, sir?’\r\n\r\n‘Nothing more to-night; you have all my orders for the\r\npresent.—Good-night, Derrick.’\r\n\r\n‘Good-night, sir.’\r\n\r\nWhen the last faint clank of Derrick’s boots has ceased to ring upon\r\nthe staircase, Sir Carnaby Vincent rises and locks the door, glancing\r\noutside first, to see that no one lurks without. This being done, he\r\ncarefully bars the shutters over the window, looks inside two cupboards\r\nwhich the room contains, and then having ascertained that he is not\r\nlikely to be overlooked, draws forth the afore-mentioned saddle-bags. A\r\nstrange look of anxiety passes over the fugitive’s face as he plunges\r\nhis hand into one of them, and brings out a small, shallow, oaken box,\r\nblack with age. Its contents are apparently of no little value, for\r\nthe lid is secured by two locks, and a corresponding number of blotchy\r\nred seals, upon which may be deciphered the impression of a crest. Sir\r\nCarnaby turns the box over and examines its fastenings, then rises and\r\nwalks slowly round the room, as if in search of something. His manner\r\nat this moment is most strange, and the light step with which he treads\r\nover the old flooring does not awaken enough creaking to disturb a\r\nmouse. Four times round the room he goes, with a curious expression on\r\nhis face which would puzzle even a skilful physiognomist to interpret,\r\nthen stooping down, he places the box on the floor and appears to\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUSK-RAT OF INDIA.\r\n\r\nFROM AN ANGLO-INDIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe musk-rat is from six to eight inches long, of a slatish-blue\r\ncolour, with a long movable snout, and diminutive eyes. Its skin is\r\nvery loose, and quite conceals the extremities, only allowing the feet\r\nto be seen. This formation occasions the peculiar pattering of its\r\nrun. The tail, broad at its base, is pinkish and bare of everything\r\nexcept a few hairs; ears are diminutive. Loathed and detested by all,\r\nthis creature leads a charmed life; only a few dogs will kill it, and\r\nthen there is always sneezing and a little foaming afterwards. Cats\r\nfollow but won’t touch it; it is, moreover, equally avoided by more\r\naristocratic rats and mice. As the animal runs along the wall of the\r\nroom, it emits a kind of self-satisfied purr, which, if alarmed, breaks\r\ninto a squeak, and immediately the scent-bottle is opened. If there is\r\nlight to see the tiny creature, you will observe it scanning with its\r\nnose all parts of the horizon in search of what caused the alarm; the\r\neyes apparently being unequal to the task.\r\n\r\nMusk-rats have a singular habit of always running along the walls of\r\na room, never crossing from one wall to the other; hence, as they are\r\nnot swift movers, they are easily overtaken, and a blow from a cane\r\ninstantly kills the animal. Traps are of little use in capturing these\r\ncreatures; and if one is captured, that trap is for ever useless as\r\nregards ordinary rats and mice, which won’t approach it after being\r\ncontaminated. ‘Muskies’ are omnivorous and very voracious. During the\r\nrains, the insect world is on the wing. If at this season you place\r\na night-light on the ground near the beat of a musk-rat, you will be\r\namused at watching its antics in trying to catch some of the buzzers\r\nround the light, or those crawling up the wall, and will be surprised\r\nat its agility. The captives are ruthlessly crunched, and the animal\r\nnever seems satiated; at the same time its enjoyment is evinced by\r\nits purring. Woe betide him should another musky invade this happy\r\nhunting-ground! War is at once proclaimed, and immediately the two are\r\nfighting for their lives, squeaking, snapping, biting, rolling over\r\nand over, and all the time letting off their awful scent-bottles. You,\r\nin the comparative distance, just escape the disgusting odour; but the\r\ninsect invasion catch it full, and quickly leave the scene. And so the\r\nfight goes on, until you happily catch both the combatants with one\r\nblow of your cane, and the stinking turmoil ceases; and having thrown\r\nopen the doors to ventilate the room, you are glad to retire to rest.\r\n\r\nI was awakened one night at Arrah by the squeaking and stench of two\r\nmusk-rats, which were in mortal combat near my bed. Quietly rising and\r\nseizing my slipper, I smote the combatants a wrathful blow, to which\r\none succumbed, and the other escaped through the venetian. I then lay\r\ndown again, but only to hear the hateful p-r-r-r-r of ‘musky,’ who had\r\ncome to look after his dead brother. Seizing him, he carried him off\r\nto the venetian, and there dropped him with a squeak, as I rose to my\r\nelbow. Bringing the dead rat back and laying my slipper handy, I again\r\nlay down. Very soon I heard the disgusting purr and saw the dead musky\r\nbeing carried off; and now the slipper was true, and both muskies lay\r\nprone.\r\n\r\nApropos to this, if you throw out a dead rat or mouse, he is at once\r\nswooped upon by a kite or crow; but both these scavengers will avoid\r\na dead musk-rat; the kite will swoop and pass on as if he had not\r\nnoticed the odour, whilst our old friend the crow will alight at a\r\nsafe distance, and with one eye survey the dead shrew. Perhaps in that\r\nglance a whiff from the scent-bottle reaches him, for he hops off a\r\nyard or two, caws, and then rubs his beak once or twice on the ground.\r\nThen he takes an observation with the other eye, caws, and flies up\r\ninto the overhanging nína tree. No one will touch the dead musk-rat;\r\neven those faithful undertakers, the burying-beetles, avoid him.\r\n\r\nNow, what is the scent of the musk-rat like? When I was last at home in\r\n1875, I went into a greenhouse on a hot summer day, and found it given\r\nup to the musk-plant. ‘Muskies! muskies!’ I exclaimed, as I fled from\r\nthe stifling, dank, and fetid atmosphere. Get up that combination—a\r\nhot day, a dank, humid, and suffocating greenhouse given up to the\r\nmusk-plant, and you will have the full effect of only one full-blown\r\nmusky. The odour of the plant, heavy when close, is delicate when\r\ndiffused; the scent of the musk-rat, on the other hand, is heavy when\r\ndiffused, and insupportable when near. The marvellous diffusibility of\r\nthis odour is illustrated in many ways. It has long been maintained\r\nthat the musk-rat has only to pass over a closely corked bottle of\r\nwine to destroy its contents. I have tasted sherry so destroyed, and\r\nat the same time have placed corked bottles of water in the runs of\r\nmusk-rats without any defilement. The odour won’t permeate glass, so\r\nthe bottle of sherry must have been contaminated by a defiled cork.\r\nPlace a porous water-goblet (_sooráhí_) in the run of a musk-rat, and\r\ndefilement is secure; and if that goblet endures for a hundred years,\r\nit will during that century affect all water which may be put into it.\r\nThese animals seem to enjoy communicating their disgusting odour to\r\nsurrounding objects. It doesn’t follow that mere contact conveys it,\r\nfor I have often handled these animals without contamination; but there\r\nis undoubtedly—setting aside the scent-bottle as a means of defence—an\r\ninstinctive marking of objects for purposes of recognition, sheer\r\nmischief, or for the easing of the secretion organ.\r\n\r\nAnother anomaly pertains to this animal: though so disgusting to\r\nothers, it is not so to itself; and it is one of the tidiest and most\r\ncleanly of animals. Its nesting arrangements, too, are very peculiar;\r\nnothing is more greedily utilised than paper, which it tears up. Some\r\nyears ago, I lived in a boarded house, and used to be nightly worried\r\nby a pattering and purring musky dragging a newspaper towards a certain\r\ncorner. Arrived there, it disappeared down a hole and pulled the paper\r\nafter it—that is, as much as would enter the hole. If I gently removed\r\nthe paper, the inquisitive nose would appear ranging round the hole,\r\nand shortly after, the animal itself in quest of the paper. I had the\r\nboarding taken up, and there, in a paper nest, lay five pink and naked\r\nmuskies, all heads, with hardly any bodies, and quite blind.\r\n\r\nI cannot find one redeeming trait in the character and conduct of\r\n_Sorex cœrulescens_, and I must admit that he is an ill-favoured beast,\r\nand of questionable utility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DAY IN EARLY SUMMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A little wood, wherein with silver sound\r\n      A brooklet whispers all the sunny day,\r\n    And on its banks all flow’rets which abound\r\n      In the bright circle of the charmèd May:\r\n    Primroses, whose faint fragrance you may know\r\n      From other blooms; and oxlips, whose sweet breath\r\n    Is kissed by windflowers—star-like gems which blow\r\n      Beside pale sorrel, in whose veins is death;\r\n    Larch-trees are there, with plumes of palest green;\r\n      And cherry, dropping leaves of scented white;\r\n    While happy birds, amid the verdant screen,\r\n      Warble their songs of innocent delight.\r\n    Surely they err who say life is not blest;\r\n    Hither may come the weary and have rest.\r\n\r\n            J.
