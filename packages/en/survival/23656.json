M.; President Morris presiding.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: The meeting will be called to order. We have first an\r\naddress by the Mayor of Lancaster, Mayor McClean. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMayor McClean: Ladies and gentlemen of the Northern Nut Growers\r\nAssociation:\r\n\r\nThe Mayor of a city of the size of this, in which conventions meet so\r\nfrequently, is so often called upon to make a speech that the prospect\r\nof having to do so causes him some disturbance of mind, not only on the\r\nday of the delivery of the speech but for many days preceding; but I\r\nconfess that the invitation to come here today has had no such effect on\r\nme. I am very glad to meet and mix up with the members of this\r\norganization. The evolutionists tell us where we came from; the\r\ntheologians, where we are going to; but no matter how much we may differ\r\nas to the theories of these respective leaders of thought, upon one\r\nthing we can all agree and that is that we are here. You ladies and\r\ngentlemen representing the Northern Nut Growers Association are here to\r\ninterchange opinions and discuss questions which have to do with the\r\ngreater success of the very useful industry, the youthful and useful\r\nindustry, in which you are engaged. I am here as the Mayor of this\r\ngoodly town to tell you that you are not looked upon as intruders; that\r\nwe will be blind when you help yourselves to our wine flasks, but that\r\nwe will not be deaf should you ask for more. I am thoroughly in sympathy\r\nwith the purpose of this organization, understanding it to be the\r\nencouragement of the planting of nut bearing trees in order that an\r\naddition to our present food supply may be provided; and that much waste\r\nland, now profitless, may be taken up and converted to practical and\r\nprofitable uses; and further that through the medium of such tree\r\nplanting and tree care as you propose, landscape embellishment in\r\ngreater degree than that which now exists may be provided. We hear very\r\nmuch about conservation these days and it seems to me that the\r\nproposition which you advance is conservation in a very worthy and very\r\nhigh degree. The soil and climate of Lancaster County seem to be\r\npeculiarly adapted to the growing of trees bearing nuts and fruits, and\r\nI am sure that the result of this convention will be to stimulate\r\nlocally a very great interest in this worthy undertaking. You have\r\nchosen wisely in selecting Lancaster as the place for this meeting,\r\nbecause we feel and we are satisfied that you will agree, after you have\r\nbeen here a few days, that this was the town that Kipling had in mind\r\nwhen he wrote of the town that was born lucky. (Laughter.) Here you will\r\nfind all the creature comforts, everything that makes for the pleasure\r\nof existence, good food and good water, and if there be any of you who\r\nhave a liking for beverages other than water, it may be some consolation\r\nto you to know that in this vicinity the mint beds are not used for\r\npasture, the punch bowls are not permanently filled with carnations, the\r\ncock-tail glasses show no signs of disuse and the corkscrew hangs within\r\nreach of your shortest member. (Laughter.) We are a great people over\r\nthis way. Perhaps you are not aware of that, but we bear prosperity with\r\nmeekness and adversity with patience. We feel that we can say to you,\r\nwithout boasting, if you seek a pleasant country, look about you. You\r\nmay not know it, but it is a fact and the United States census reports\r\never since census reports have been made will prove it, that the annual\r\nvaluation of the agricultural products of the county in which you now\r\nsit exceeds that of any other county in all this great nation.\r\n(Applause.) Another bit of local history may surprise you when I tell\r\nyou that the combined deposits of the banks of Lancaster County\r\napproximate the enormous amount of fifty million dollars, that they are\r\nlarger than the total deposits of any one of seven states in the Union\r\nthat I can name and that they exceed the combined deposits of two of\r\nthose seven states. But I don't want to take up your time with a\r\nrecitation of local history, because I feel that your Lancaster\r\ncolleagues will give you all the information, and I don't want to spoil\r\ntheir pleasure in giving it by anticipating them. I congratulate you\r\nupon the success of this convention. I applaud the purpose for which you\r\nare united. I felicitate you upon your achievements up to this time, and\r\npredict for you a greater measure of usefulness and advantage in the\r\ntime to come, which usefulness and advantage, let me suggest, can be\r\nmade yours more promptly, certainly more surely, by your proceeding upon\r\nthe principle that whatever is of benefit to the organization as a whole\r\nmust be of benefit to each of its members, either directly or\r\nindirectly. I trust that you will go on with this good work and\r\nstimulate enthusiasm in your purpose in a nation wide way, working\r\ntogether with one common object, proceeding under the motto of the Three\r\nGuardsmen of France, \"One For All and All For One.\" I now extend to you\r\nthe freedom of the city. Roam where you will. Just one bit of advice I\r\nhave to give. Contrary, perhaps, to general report, this is not a slow\r\ntown and therefore you are in more danger of being run down than run in.\r\n(Laughter.) I will not follow the time honored practice of handing you\r\nthe keys of the city, for the reason that when I heard you were on the\r\nway, I had the old gates taken off the hinges in order that your\r\nincoming might be in no way impeded. (Laughter.) And now, in the name of\r\nthe city of Lancaster, its heart filled with the sunny warmth of July, I\r\nbid you welcome and promise that we will try to extend to you a\r\nhospitality as generous as golden October. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Will Mr. Littlepage please respond to the Mayor's kindly\r\naddress of welcome?\r\n\r\nHon. T. P. Littlepage: Mr. President: On behalf of the members of the\r\nNorthern Nut Growers Association, I desire to thank the Mayor very\r\ncordially for his delightful words of welcome to this city. We feel that\r\nthe words haven't any strings to them, such as were indicated in a\r\nlittle poem I noticed the other day, which said that a young man took\r\nhis girl to an ice cream parlor and she ate and she ate and she ate\r\nuntil at last she gave him her heart to make room for another plate.\r\n(Laughter.) There apparently isn't anything of that in the cordial\r\nwelcome which we have received here to this great County of Lancaster. I\r\nknow now after hearing the Mayor's discourse upon the great resources of\r\nthis county, why it was that a young fellow who had rambled out into the\r\nWest and happened to drop into an old fashioned protracted meeting, when\r\nasked to come up to the mourners' bench, objected somewhat, and finally\r\nwhen they said, \"Well, young man, you've got to be born again;\" replied,\r\n\"No, it isn't necessary, I was born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.\"\r\n(Laughter and applause.) I understand now why the young man was so\r\nsanguine, why it wasn't necessary to be born again, even under the\r\nauspices of the Great Spirit. It is very gratifying indeed to be in the\r\nmidst of a great county of this kind that has made one of the great\r\nbasic industries so successful. It takes three things to make a really\r\ngreat nation; it takes great natural resources, it takes great policies\r\nand it takes great people. We have nations in this world where the\r\nresources, the possibilities of agriculture and all lines of human\r\nendeavor are as unlimited, almost, as ours, but they haven't the people\r\nand in the cases where they have people of the right kind, they haven't\r\nadopted the policies. It takes those three things for any county, any\r\nstate or any nation to be really great, and it is indeed gratifying to\r\nthose of us who believe in the highest development, the best for\r\nhumanity, to come into a county where the people, through their\r\nindustry, their policies of advancement, have made that county one of\r\nthe best farmed agricultural counties in the United States; and that is\r\nsaying a great deal when you consider the greatness of this nation and\r\nher immense wealth and resources. It is indeed gratifying to all of us\r\nwho are spending some time and some effort to further somewhat the\r\nadvancement of the country along horticultural lines, to be met with a\r\ncordial welcome and to come into this community that has so highly\r\ndeveloped her various resources: so, on behalf of this Association and\r\nall its members, even the members that are not here, those of them who\r\nmight, if they desired, take advantage of the Mayor's corkscrew and\r\ncarnation bowl, I thank the Mayor and thank the citizens of this County\r\nand say that we are delighted to be among you. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: We will now proceed with the regular order of business. As\r\nmy paper happens to be placed first on the list, through the methods of\r\nthe Secretary, I will ask Mr. Littlepage to kindly take the chair while\r\nI present notes on the subject of hybridizing nut trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF HYBRIDIZING NUT TREES\r\n\r\nDR. ROBERT T. MORRIS, NEW YORK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. ROBERT T. MORRIS OF NEW YORK\r\n\r\n_First President of the Association, 1911 and 1912_]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the experimental work of hybridizing nut trees, we soon come to learn\r\nthat a number of practical points need to be acquired before successful\r\nhybridizing can be done. This is a special field in which few have taken\r\npart as yet, and consequently any notes upon the subject will add to\r\nthe sum total of the knowledge which we wish to acquire as rapidly as\r\npossible. First, in collecting pollen; it is important to shake our\r\npollen into dry paper boxes. If we try to preserve the pollen in glass\r\nor in metal, it is attacked by various mould fungi and is rapidly\r\ndestroyed. We have to remember that pollen consists of live cells which\r\nhave quite as active a place in the organic world as a red squirrel, and\r\nthe pollen grains need to breathe quite as much as a red squirrel needs\r\nto breathe. Therefore they must not be placed in glass or metal or\r\ntightly sealed. Further, the pollen grains need to be kept cool in order\r\nto avoid attacks from the greatest enemy of all organic life, the\r\nmicrobes or the lower fungi. Probably we may keep pollen for a longer\r\ntime than it could ordinarily be kept, if it is placed in cold storage,\r\nbut practically I have tried the experiment on only one occasion. Last\r\nyear I wished to cross the chinkapin with the white oak. The white oak\r\nblossoms more than a month in advance of the chinkapin in Connecticut,\r\nand the question was how we could keep the white oak pollen. Some of it\r\nwas placed in paper boxes in cold storage; some in paper boxes in the\r\ncellar in a dry place. Pollen which had been kept in the cellar and\r\npollen which had been kept in cold storage were about equally viable. It\r\nis quite remarkable to know that pollen can be kept for more than a\r\nmonth under any circumstances. Hybridization occurred in my chinkapins\r\nfrom this white oak pollen. Sometimes, where the flowering time of such\r\ntrees is far apart, it is important to know how we may secure pollen of\r\none kind for the female flowers of the other. Two methods are possible.\r\nIn the first place, we may secure pollen from the northern or southern\r\nrange of a species for application upon pistillate flowers at the other\r\nend of the range of that species. Another way is to collect branches\r\ncarrying male flowers before the flowers have developed, place them in\r\nthe ice house or in a dark, cold room without light until the proper\r\ntime for forcing the flowers, and if these branches are then placed in\r\nwater, the water changed frequently as when we are keeping flowers\r\ncarefully, the catkins or other male flowers will develop pollen\r\nsatisfactorily a long time after their natural time of furnishing\r\npollen, when they are brought out into the light. In protecting\r\npistillate flowers from the pollen of their own trees, with the nut tree\r\ngroup where pollen is wind-borne rather than insect borne, I find that\r\nthe better way is to cover the pistillate flowers with paper bags, the\r\nthinner the better, the kind that we get at the grocery store. It is\r\nbest to pull off the undeveloped male flowers if they happen to be on\r\nthe same branch with the female flowers, and then place the bags over\r\nthe female flowers at about the time when they blossom, in advance of\r\npollination of the male flowers. It is not safe to depend upon pulling\r\noff the male flowers of an isolated tree and leaving the female flowers\r\nwithout bags to protect them from pollen of the same species or of\r\nallied species, for the reason that wind may carry pollen to a great\r\ndistance. One of Mr. Burbank's critics--I am sorry he has so many, for\r\nthey are not all honest or serious--one of his critics, in relation to\r\nthe crossing of walnuts, said that it was due to no particular skill on\r\nthe part of Mr. Burbank, for, whenever the wind blew from the east, he\r\nregretted to say that his entire orchard of Persian walnuts became\r\npollinized from the California black walnuts nearly half a mile away.\r\nThis is an exaggeration, because the chances are that most of the\r\nPersian walnuts were pollenized from their own pollen, but in the case\r\nof some Persian walnuts blossoming early, and developing female flowers\r\nin advance of male flowers, pollen might be carried to them from half a\r\nmile away in a high wind from California black walnut trees. Black\r\nwalnut pollen would then fertilize pistillate flowers of the Persian\r\nwalnut. I have found this a real danger, this danger of wind-pollination\r\nat a distance, much to my surprise. Last year I pollinized one or two\r\nlower branches of female flowers of a butternut tree which had no other\r\nbutternut tree within a distance of a good many rods, so far away that I\r\nhad no idea that the pollen would be carried from the tree with male\r\nflowers to the one which happened to have female flowers only that year;\r\nconsequently I placed pecan pollen on the female flowers of the lower\r\nbranches of this butternut tree without protecting them with bags, and\r\nleft the rest of the tree unguarded. There were no male flowers on that\r\nbutternut tree that year. Much to my surprise, not only my pollinized\r\nflowers but the whole tree bore a good crop of butternuts. This year, on\r\naccount of the drought, many of the hickory trees bore female flowers\r\nonly. I do not know that it was on account of the drought, but I have\r\nnoted that after seasons of drought, trees are apt to bear flowers of\r\none sex or the other, trees which normally bear flowers of both sexes.\r\nThis year a number of hickory trees bore flowers of one sex only, and I\r\nnoted that some shagbark trees which had no male flowers had fairly good\r\ncrops of nuts from pollen blown from a distance from other trees. I had\r\none pignut tree (H. Glabra) full of female flowers which contained only\r\none male flower, so far as I could discover and which I removed. On one\r\nside of this tree was a bitternut; on the other side a shagbark. This\r\ntree bore a full crop of pignuts, (Hicoria glabra) evidently pollinized\r\non one side by the bitternut and on the other side by the shagbark These\r\npoints are made for the purpose of showing the necessity of covering the\r\nfemale flowers with bags in our nut tree hybridizations. We must\r\nsprinkle Persian insect powder inside the bags or insects will increase\r\nunder protection. When we have placed bags over female flowers, it is\r\nnecessary to mark the limb; otherwise, other nuts borne on neighboring\r\nlimbs will be mistaken for the hybridized nuts unless we carefully place\r\na mark about the limb. Copper wire twisted loosely is, I find, the best.\r\nCopper wire carrying a copper tag with the names of the trees which are\r\ncrossed is best. If I mark the limb with string or with strong cord I\r\nfind there are many ways for its disappearance. Early in the spring the\r\nbirds like it so well that they will untie square knots in order to put\r\nit into their nests. Later in the season the squirrels will bite off\r\nthese marks made with cords for no other purpose, so far as I know,\r\nexcept satisfying a love of mischief. Now I am not psychologist enough\r\nto state that this is the reason for the action of the red squirrel, and\r\ncan only remember that when I was a boy I used to do things that the red\r\nsquirrel now does. (Laughter.) Consequently, on that basis, I traced the\r\npsychology back to plain pure mischief. Red squirrels and white footed\r\nmice must be looked after with great care in our hybridized trees. If\r\nthe squirrels cannot get at a nut that is surrounded by wire cloth, they\r\nwill cut off the branch and allow it to fall to the ground and then\r\nmanage to get it out. White footed mice will make their way through\r\nwire, and mice and squirrels will both manage to bite through wire cloth\r\nunless it is very strong in order to get at the nut. The mere fact of\r\nnuts being protected by wire cloth or in other ways seems to attract the\r\nattention of squirrels. One of my men, a Russian, said, in rather broken\r\nEnglish, \"Me try remember which nuts pollinized; no put on wire, no put\r\non tag, no put on nothing; squirrel see that, see right straight, bite\r\noff one where you put sign for him.\" (Laughter.) The best way for\r\nkeeping squirrels and white footed mice from ascending a tree, I find is\r\nby tacking common tin, slippery smooth tin, around the trunk of the tree\r\nand this may be left on only during the time when squirrels are likely\r\nto ascend the tree. They will begin long before the nuts are ripe. In\r\nthe case of hazel nuts, I have surrounded the bushes with a wire fence\r\nor wire mesh, leaving a little opening on one side, and have placed\r\nsteel traps in the opening. Now here enters a danger which one does not\r\nlearn about excepting from practical experience. I went out one morning\r\nshortly after having thought of this bright idea and found two gray\r\nsquirrels in the traps. They had followed their natural instinct of\r\nclimbing when they got into the steel traps, and climbing wildly had\r\nbroken off every single branch from those hazels which carried\r\nhybridized nuts. There wasn't one left, because the squirrels when\r\ncaught had climbed into the trees and had so violently torn about with\r\ntrap and chain that they had broken off every single branch with a nut\r\non it. So many things happen in our experiments that appeal to one's\r\nsense of the ludicrous, if he has a sense of humor, that I assure you\r\nnut raising is a source of great delight to those who are fond of the\r\ndrama.\r\n\r\nThe field of hybridizing nut trees offers enormous prospects. We are\r\nonly just upon the margin of this field, just beginning to look into the\r\nvista. It has been done only in a limited way, so far, by crossing\r\npollen and flowers under quite normal conditions. We may look forward to\r\nextending the range now of pollinization from knowledge based upon the\r\nexperiments of Loeb and his followers in biology. They have succeeded in\r\ndeveloping embryos from the eggs of the sea urchin, of the nereis, and\r\nof mollusks, without spermatozoa. Their work has shown that each egg is\r\na single cell with a cell membrane and it is only necessary to destroy\r\nthis cell membrane according to a definite plan to start that egg to\r\ngrowing. Life may be started from the egg in certain species without the\r\npresence of the other sex. This may lead us into a tremendous new field\r\nin our horticultural work. We may be able to treat germ cells with acids\r\nor other substances which destroy the cell membrane so as to allow\r\ncrossing between very widely separated species and genera. Loeb, by\r\ndestroying the cell membrane of the sea urchin, was enabled to cross the\r\nsea urchin with the star fish, and no one knows but we may be able,\r\nfollowing this line of experimentation, eventually to cross the shagbark\r\nhickory with a pumpkin and get a shagbark hickory nut half the size of\r\nthe pumpkin. That is all! (Applause.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(President Morris then took the chair.)\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Please let me add that the hickory pumpkin idea is not to\r\nbe taken seriously. That is a highly speculative proposition. I have\r\nfound some times that, in a very scientific audience, men who were\r\ntrained in methods of science, had very little selvage of humor,--little\r\nmargin for any pleasantry, but this highly speculative suggestion,\r\ncuriously enough, is not in fact more speculative than would have been\r\nthe idea twelve years ago that you could hatch an egg, start an egg to\r\ndevelopment--without fertilization.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutt: I would like to ask how widely you have been able to cross\r\nspecies?\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: It has been possible to cross species of hazels freely\r\nwith the four species that I have used, the American hazel, Corylus\r\nAmericana; the beak hazel, Corylus rostrata; the Asiatic, Corylus\r\ncolurna, and Corylus pontica. These apparently cross readily back and\r\nforth. With the hickories I think rather free hybridization occurs back\r\nand forth among all, but particularly in relation to groups. The\r\nopen-bud hickories, comprising the pecan, the bitternut, the water\r\nhickory, and the nutmeg hickory, apparently, from my experiments, cross\r\nmuch more readily among each other than they cross with the scale-bud\r\nhickories. The scale-bud hickories appear to cross much more freely\r\namong each other than they cross with the open-bud hickories; not only\r\nspecies but genera may be crossed, and I find that the walnuts\r\napparently cross freely with the open-bud hickories and the open-bud\r\nhickories cross with the walnuts. I have thirty-two crosses between the\r\nbitternut hickory and our common butternut, growing. All of the walnuts\r\napparently cross rather freely back and forth with each other. I have\r\nnot secured fertile nuts between the oaks and chestnuts, but I believe\r\nthat we may get fertile nuts eventually. The nuts fill well upon these\r\ntwo trees fertilized with each others' pollen respectively, but I have\r\nnot as yet secured fertile ones. We shall find some fertile crosses I\r\nthink between oaks and chestnuts, when enough species have been tried.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutt: Do you notice any difference in the shapes of any of those\r\nhybrids, the nuts, when you get them matured and harvested? Do they look\r\nany different from the other nuts on the tree?\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: There isn't very much difference, but I seem to think that\r\nsometimes the pollen has exercised an influence upon the nuts of the\r\nyear. Theoretically it should not do so, but I noticed one case\r\napparently in which I crossed a chinkapin with a Chinese chestnut, and\r\nthe nuts of that year seemed to me to present some of the Chinese\r\nchestnuts' characteristics.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutt: This year I crossed a number of varieties of pecans and in\r\nnearly all those crosses there was to me quite an evident difference in\r\nthe nuts. For instance those gathered off certain parts of a pecan tree\r\nof certain varieties, Schley or Curtis or Frotscher, would be typical\r\nnuts, but those hybrids or crosses that I produced were distorted, more\r\nor less misshapen and seemed to have peculiarities; so that when we came\r\nto look over the colony we were in doubt whether they were hand\r\npollinated hybrids or had been pollinated before we got the blossoms\r\ncovered. Many of them evidenced a great number of distortions, and one\r\nof them I remember particularly whose shell was so thin it was just like\r\na piece of brown paper; and there were several peculiarities that were\r\nquite noticeable in those hand pollinated nuts.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: That is a very interesting point. When we come to consider\r\ndeformities of nuts we shall find very many cases due to the character\r\nof the pollinization. I crossed the Persian walnut with the shagbark\r\nhickory and had nuts that year of just the sort of which Mr. Hunt\r\nspeaks, with shells as thin as paper. One could crush them with the very\r\nslightest pressure of the finger. The shells were not well developed.\r\nUnfortunately the mice happened to get at all of those nuts. I don't\r\nknow if they were fertile or not. The kernels were only about half\r\ndeveloped. I should look for deformity in these nuts rather than a\r\ntaking on of the type of one parent over the other, the idea being based\r\non theoretical biological considerations. We had last year a photograph\r\nof a tree in California which apparently was a cross, a very odd\r\ncross--does any one remember about that California tree?\r\n\r\nMr. Wilcox: It was a cross between Juglans Californica and the live oak.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Both the foliage and the nuts were very remarkable and\r\npertained to characters of these two trees. Such a cross to my mind\r\nwould be wholly unexplainable excepting on the ground recently brought\r\nout by Loeb and his followers in crossing the lower forms of animal life\r\nand finding that the cell membrane of the egg, if destroyed, will allow\r\nof very wide fertilization subsequently with other species. It occurs to\r\nme now--I had no explanation last year, but it occurs to me now,\r\nknowing of Loeb's experiments--that it is possible that one of the\r\nparents, the parent California oak tree carrying the female flowers,\r\nmight have had its sex cells subjected to some peculiar influence like\r\nacid, sulphurous acid, for instance, from some nearby chimney.\r\nSulphurous acid perhaps from someone merely lighting a match to light a\r\ncigar under the tree; he might have so sensitized a few female flowers,\r\nmay have so injured the cell membrane of a few female germ cells that\r\ncross pollinization then took place from a walnut tree. It is only on\r\nsome such ground as the findings of Loeb that we can explain such a very\r\nunusual hybridization as that, which appeared to me a valid one, of a\r\ncross between an oak and a walnut.\r\n\r\n(Secretary Deming then called attention to hybrids in the various\r\nexhibits.)\r\n\r\nProfessor Smith: I should like to ask why, if this free hybridization\r\ntakes place in nature among the hickories, you do not have a perfect\r\ncomplex of trees showing all possible variations in the forest.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: In answer to Professor Smith's question I will start from\r\nhis premises and remark that we do have such complexities. The hickories\r\nare so crossed at the present time, like our apples, that even crossing\r\nthe pollen of various hickory trees of any one species does not promise\r\ninteresting results unless we cross an enormous number. They are already\r\nso widely crossed that it is very difficult sometimes to determine if a\r\ncertain tree is shagbark or pignut or shellbark or mockernut. For the\r\nmost part the various species and varieties of hickories retain their\r\nidentity because their own pollen is handiest, and different species do\r\nnot all flower at the same time. Their own pollen from the male flowers\r\nis apt to fall at the time when their own female flowers are ripe and\r\nunder these circumstances the chances are very much in favor of the tree\r\npollinizing its female flowers with its own pollen. On the other hand,\r\nthere is hardly one chance in many hundred thousand for any crossed nut\r\nto grow, for the reason that most nuts are destroyed by mice, squirrels,\r\nrats and boys. If you have a hickory nut tree growing in a lot, and\r\nwhich has produced a bushel of hickory nuts year after year, do you know\r\nof one single nut from that tree which has grown? In this plan of\r\nNature, this plan of enormous waste of Nature in order to get one seed\r\nto grow, the chance for a hybridized hickory nut to grow under normal\r\nconditions, is so small that we should have relatively few crossed\r\ntrees growing wild in Nature, though we do find quite a good many of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nProfessor Smith: If I am not taking up too much time, I would like to\r\nput some more questions to you.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: That's what we are here for.\r\n\r\nProfessor Smith: Have you ever tried the plan of serving collations to\r\nsquirrels? Why wouldn't it pay to give them portions of wheat and corn?\r\nSecond, what percentage of the oak pollen kept in cold storage a month\r\nwas alive? Third, what is the range of time that the hybridizer has to\r\nmake the pollinization? Must we go on the dot or have we two days or\r\nfour days or a week, in the case of hickories and walnuts?\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: I think possibly as these are three direct questions, I\r\nmight answer them now. No, I think it would be better to have all\r\nquestions bearing on this subject brought out and then I will answer all\r\ntogether. So if you will kindly ask all the questions, I will then\r\nendeavor to answer them.\r\n\r\nMr. Corsan: The squirrels bothered me last year. I've got forty acres of\r\nland for experimental purposes only and I started planting and the\r\nlittle beggars would dig down exactly where I planted the nuts, so I\r\nwent into town and got a rat trap with a double section so I could catch\r\nthem alive; and I caught so many by feeding them cheap pignuts, the\r\nsweet pignuts from Michigan, that I brought them in and my boys sold\r\nthem for twenty-five cents apiece. Since then we have never been\r\nbothered with red squirrels. For the white footed mice I laid down large\r\ndoors over some hay or long grass and they gathered underneath and then\r\nI lifted the doors up every day and with a stick I smashed hundreds of\r\nthem. I have posted a notice to leave the skunk and mink alone; I don't\r\nwant anybody on the place shooting them.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: I will first answer Professor Smith's questions. This\r\nmatter of serving collations for squirrels had best be done as\r\ncollations are served at political meetings--with a trap attached. You\r\ndon't know how many squirrels there are in the vicinity or how many\r\nwhite footed mice. You will be surprised at the numbers of the little\r\nrascals, and not only that, but the field mice, the common field mouse\r\nand pine mouse run in mole holes under the ground and can smell a nut a\r\nlong way off. They are extremely destructive. What percentage of pollen\r\ngrains of the white oak were alive? I do not know. Enough to fertilize\r\na number of flowers. The sooner pollen is used the better. I cannot\r\nanswer the question exactly because I did not make an experiment in the\r\nlaboratory to know what part of the pollen was viable. I put on a good\r\ndeal of it and there were at least some viable grains in the lot. That,\r\nhowever, is a matter which can be subjected to exact laboratory tests\r\nwithout any difficulty. I am so busy with so many things that I can only\r\nfollow the plan of the guinea hen that lays forty eggs and sits in the\r\nmiddle of the nest and hatches out all she can. Now the range of time\r\nfor pollinizing is a thing of very great importance and we have to learn\r\nabout it. We must all furnish notes on this question. With some species\r\nI presume the duration of life of pollen, even under the best\r\nconditions, might be only a few days. Under other conditions it may be\r\nseveral weeks; but we have to remember that, in dealing with pollen, we\r\nare dealing with a living, breathing organism.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: I believe the experiment has been carried to completion\r\nof fruiting a thousand trees from nuts grown on one pecan tree without\r\ntwo of the resulting nuts being like one another or like the parent nut.\r\nIs that true, Mr. Reed.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: Yes, you might say ten thousand.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: We have an illustration of the variability of the progeny\r\nof a nut in this collection of chestnuts by Mr. Riehl out in Illinois.\r\nThis is a parent nut, the Rochester, and these others are seedlings from\r\nthe Rochester, except where marked otherwise, some showing a tendency to\r\nrevert to the parent, and some promising to be improvements on the\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Mr. Secretary, I think we'd better confine ourselves to\r\nthe hybrid question at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: Are not those all hybrids?\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: I don't believe any man can tell, unless you get the\r\nflowers, because you have the American and European types merging\r\ntogether so perfectly. Some of them show distinctly the European type;\r\nothers show distinctly the American type. That is what I would expect,\r\nhowever. The practical point is the question of quality. Which one keeps\r\nthe American quality and which one retains the coarseness of the\r\nEuropean type?\r\n\r\nMr. Harris: Speaking of variations of nuts I think it is well known that\r\nthere is quite a variation in the nuts of the oak. I noticed in one\r\nspecies, michauxii, which is an oak in the South, that its nuts varied\r\na great deal. It is something of the type of the chestnut, the white oak\r\nor the rock oaks and it varies a great deal.\r\n\r\nI found one on my father's range in New Jersey and also one on the\r\nPotomac. The variations extend to the trees as well as the nuts.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: The oak tree properly belongs in another tree group and\r\nsome of the acorns are not only edible, but first-rate. In China there\r\nare at least three species found in the markets to be eaten out of hand\r\nor roasted. Our white oaks here, some of them, bear very good fruit,\r\nfrom the standpoint of the boy and the pig, anyway, and it seems to me\r\nthat we may properly include the oaks in our discussion. There would be\r\ngreat range in variation of type from hybridization between oak trees\r\nand I have seen a number of oak trees that were evidently hybrids, where\r\nthe parentage could be traced on both sides, that were held at very high\r\nprices by the nurserymen. I asked one nurseryman, who wanted an enormous\r\nprice for one hybrid oak, why he didn't make ten thousand of those for\r\nhimself next year? It hadn't occurred to him.\r\n\r\nIf there is no further discussion in connection with my paper we will\r\nhave Mr. Littlepage's paper on Nut Promotions.\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: Dr. Deming said that he thought it might be time that we\r\nhave something just a little lighter--that either he should read a paper\r\nor I. (Laughter.) Inasmuch as he included himself, I took no offense\r\nwhatever. The subject I have written on, roughly and hurriedly, is\r\nFraudulent and Uninformed Promoters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAUDULENT AND UNINFORMED PROMOTERS\r\n\r\nT. P. LITTLEPAGE, WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. T. P. LITTLEPAGE\r\n\r\nOF INDIANA\r\n\r\n_President of the Association_]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, let me assert my confidence and interest in\r\nagriculture in general. This is one of the basic industries, upon the\r\nproper understanding and growth of which depends the food supply of the\r\nnation. It is admitted by scientists that, other conditions being equal,\r\nan adequacy or inadequacy in the supply of proper food makes the\r\ndifference between great people and undesirable people. This being true,\r\nthe various operations of agriculture must always be of the greatest\r\nconcern to those who are interested in the nation's welfare.\r\n\r\nThe \"back-to-the-farm\" movement is being discussed today in various\r\nperiodicals, but back of the \"back-to-the-farm\" movement is a philosophy\r\nthat has not been generally understood. It is not proper here to take\r\ntime to discuss the reasons why the man in the \"steenth\" story of some\r\nmagnificent office building, with telephones, electric lights,\r\nelevators, and all modern conveniences, longs for the time when he can\r\nroam again amidst the green fields in the sunshine and fresh air, but\r\nsuffice it to say that in my judgment a majority of the professional\r\nmen, and men in other walks of life, would, if they could, abandon their\r\nvarious employments and turn again to the soil. The boy on the farm\r\ndreams of the days when he can be the president of a bank, have a home\r\nin the city, own an automobile, smoke good cigars and go to the show\r\nevery night. The bank president dreams of the day when he can turn again\r\nto the farm and walk in the green fields, where he can shun the various\r\nartificial activities of life, drink buttermilk and retire with the\r\nchickens.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked what connection these statements have with the subject,\r\nand the answer is this--that in the minds of many thousands of people\r\nthere is this supreme desire to some day own a portion of God's\r\nfootstool to which they can retire from artificial and vainglorious\r\nenvironments to those under which they can be their real selves and\r\nfollow pursuits to their liking. It is this that makes it possible for\r\nthe promoter of various horticultural enterprises to succeed in\r\ninteresting in his schemes the clerk, the merchant, the doctor, the\r\nlawyer, the school teacher, the preacher, and all others whose\r\noccupations confine them within the limits of the great cities.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, let us distinguish between the fraudulent promoter and\r\nthe uninformed promoter. The fraudulent promoter is he who recognizes\r\nthis great and worthy ambition of many people to buy a spot to which\r\nthey can some day retire and work and rest and dream and enjoy the\r\ncoming and going of the seasons, and the sunshine and the shadows, and\r\nwho capitalizes this ambition, with that industry as his stock in trade\r\nwhich, at the particular moment, happens to offer the most attractive\r\ninducements. Those familiar with the industry he is exploiting, can tell\r\nhim by his actions, by his words, by his nods and winks. It is hard for\r\nthe crook to disguise himself to the informed.\r\n\r\nDistinguished from the fraudulent promoter is the uninformed promoter,\r\nbut, so far as results are concerned, there is not much difference\r\nbetween them for the innocent investor. They both lead him to failure.\r\nThey are unlike only in this, that the pathway of the one is lined with\r\ndeception, crookedness and chicanery; of the other, with blasted hopes\r\nbased upon good intentions but bad information. Both lead to the\r\nself-same sepulcher which in the distance looks white and beautiful but\r\nwhen reached is filled with the bones of dead men.\r\n\r\nThere is not much difference after all, when one comes right down to the\r\nfacts, between the crook who starts out deliberately to get one's money\r\nand the fellow who starts out in ignorance and makes great promises of\r\nreturns that he knows nothing about. Both succeed in getting one's money\r\nand both succeed in misleading those who have a desire to lay aside\r\nsomething for their old days. We naturally feel more charity for him who\r\nhas good intentions, but who fails, than for him who starts out with bad\r\nintentions. But, after all, only results count.\r\n\r\nDid you ever receive the literature of one of these various concerns\r\nthat has pecan or apple orchards to sell? How beautiful their schemes\r\nlook on paper! With what exquisite care they have worked out the\r\npictures and the language and the columns of figures showing the\r\nprofits! While writing this article I have before me a prospectus of a\r\ncertain pecan company that prints columns of attractive figures.\r\nFearful, however, that the figures would not convince, it has resorted\r\nto all the various schemes of the printers' art in its portrayal of the\r\nprospective profits from a grove set to pecans and Satsuma oranges, and\r\nit tells you in conclusion that it guarantees by a bond, underwritten by\r\na responsible trust company, the fulfillment of all its representations.\r\nYet what are the facts? Their lands are located in a section where the\r\nthermometer falls to a point that makes highly improbable the profitable\r\ngrowing of Satsuma oranges. And all their figures are merely estimates\r\nof the wildest character, printed in attractive columns, based upon\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the National Nut Growers Association I was this year\r\nchairman of the committee on orchard records. I sent out blanks, with\r\nlists of questions, to many prominent nut growers to see if I could\r\nsecure data upon which to base a report to the association. The replies\r\nI received showed the existence of some very promising young orchards of\r\nsmall size, well cared for, but they also showed that there was no such\r\nthing as an intelligent report upon which reliable data as to the\r\nbearing records of orchards could be based for any future calculations.\r\nThere are two reasons for this. First, most of the figures we have are\r\nbased upon the records of a few pet trees around the dooryard or garden,\r\ngrown under favorable conditions. Second, the young groves are not yet\r\nold enough for anyone to say, with any degree of accuracy, what the\r\nresults will be. Therefore, the alluring figures printed in these\r\npamphlets are only guesses.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, what of the contract of these concerns? What does it\r\nspecify? You would be surprised to know the legal construction of one of\r\nthese contracts, together with their guaranty bond. In most cases they\r\nadvertise to plant, and properly cultivate for a period of five to seven\r\nyears, orchards of the finest varieties of budded or grafted pecan\r\ntrees, with Satsuma oranges or figs set between. But the guaranty\r\ncompany is usually wise enough to have lawyers who are able to advise\r\nthem of their liabilities, and about all they actually guarantee is\r\nthat, after a period of five years, provided all payments have been\r\npromptly met, there will be turned over to the purchaser five acres of\r\nground with trees upon it. Five years old? No, they may not be one year\r\nold. Budded or grafted? No, they may be mere seedlings. Oranges set\r\nbetween them? No, the orange has passed out of the proposition before\r\nthe bond stage. The companies generally print a copy of the bond, but\r\nusually in such small type that the victim does not read it, though the\r\nheading is always prominent. It thunders in the index and fizzles in the\r\ncontext.\r\n\r\nMoreover, suppose suit is brought on one of these contracts and bonds?\r\nWhat is the measure of damages? What basis has any court or jury for\r\nfixing damages? And be it remembered that courts do not exist for the\r\nprotection of fools against their folly. The principle \"caveat emptor\"\r\nis as old as the common law itself, and it means that the buyer must\r\nbeware, or in other words, that he should inform himself, and that he\r\ncannot expect the courts to protect him where he has failed to exercise\r\ndue caution and diligence. Therefore, as a lawyer, I should very much\r\nhesitate to take on a contingent fee the suit of one of these various\r\nvictims against a promoting orchard corporation.\r\n\r\nHowever, in any jurisdiction where there is a criminal statute against\r\nfraudulent representation and obtaining money under false pretenses, I\r\nshould not hesitate, if I were the prosecuting attorney, to indict every\r\nmember of such a corporation, and, to sustain the case, I would simply\r\npresent to a jury of honest men the representations in their advertising\r\nliterature, and then have the court instruct the same jury as to the\r\nvalidity and limitations of their contract. Their advertising is\r\nbrilliant enough to dazzle the sun. Their contract is as dull as a mud\r\npie.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all of this comes the question of orcharding by proxy,\r\nand the success of the unit or acreage system, and many other similar\r\nquestions; and let me say that I doubt if there is today in the United\r\nStates one large development scheme, either in pecan or apple orchards,\r\nthat will prove of ultimate financial profit and success to the\r\npurchaser. The promoter may get rich--he has nothing at stake. In most\r\ninstances he has the price of the land in his pocket before there is a\r\nlick of work done on it, and the payments come in regularly and promptly\r\nto take care of his salary and the meager and unscientific development.\r\n\r\nOf course I would not be understood as saying that pecan or apple\r\norchards cannot be made profitable. I am of the opinion that reasonable\r\nsized orchards in proper locations and proper soil, of proper varieties,\r\nwith proper care in handling, are good investments, and, as proof of my\r\nconfidence, I am planting orchards both in the north and south. The\r\nadjective \"proper\" which I have used here may seem insignificant at the\r\nstart but, believe me, before you have begun to clip the coupons off\r\nyour orchard bonds this adjective will loom up as important as Webster's\r\nUnabridged Dictionary. In fact you will wonder how it has been possible\r\nfor anyone to forecast in one word such comprehensive knowledge. Think\r\nof a man a thousand miles away putting money into the hands of some\r\nunknown concern, for five acres of unknown land, to be set in unknown\r\nvarieties of trees, to be cared for by unknown individuals. Can he not\r\nsee that, in keeping with all the other unknown factors, his profits\r\nmust also be unknown?\r\n\r\nWe look at a great industrial enterprise, such as the steel trust, and\r\nmarvel at its success. But it must be remembered that this industry\r\nstarted many years ago, and step by step built furnace after furnace and\r\nmill after mill, after the owners had tried out and become familiar with\r\nall the factors of that industry, and after great corps of trained\r\nexperts had been developed, and after science had given to this industry\r\nmany of the most marvelous mechanical inventions of the age. These facts\r\nare overlooked, however, when some fellow steps up and proposes to put a\r\nsteel-trust-orchard on the market in twelve months. In most industrial\r\nenterprises there are well-known and established factors to be\r\nconsidered. In horticultural enterprises, however, no man knows what\r\ntwelve months hence will bring. I read the other day with great\r\ninterest the prospectus of a great pecan orchard started several years\r\nago by a very honorable and high-minded man, and the promises of success\r\nwere most alluring. What are the facts? The boll weevil came along and\r\nwiped out his intermediate cotton crops. The floods came later and\r\ndestroyed acres of his orchards, and, if he were to write a prospectus\r\ntoday, it would no doubt be a statement of hope rather than a statement\r\nof facts. He would no doubt turn from the Book of Revelations, where at\r\nthat time he saw \"a new heaven and a new earth,\" and write from the Book\r\nof Genesis, where \"the earth was without form and void.\"\r\n\r\nHow many people have been defrauded by these various schemes, no one\r\nknows. How many clerks, barbers, bookkeepers, stenographers, students,\r\npreachers, doctors, lawyers, have contributed funds for farms and future\r\nhomes in sections where they would not live if they owned half of the\r\ncounty. How many people have been separated from their cash by\r\nliterature advertising rich, fertile lands in sections where the\r\nalligator will bask unmolested in miasma for the next fifty years, and\r\nwhere projects should be sold by the gallon instead of by the acre.\r\n\r\nSome time ago it was reported that inquiries in reference to the\r\nfeasibility and profits of various orchard schemes had come in to the\r\nBureau of Plant Industry of the Agricultural Department, at Washington,\r\nin such numbers that the officials of that Bureau had considered the\r\nadvisability of printing a general circular, which they could send to\r\nthe inquirers, advising them to make due investigation, and giving a few\r\ngeneral suggestions about proxy farming and orchard schemes. I was\r\nadvised by a friend in the middle west that the contemplated issuance of\r\nthis circular by the Bureau of Plant Industry had aroused a number of\r\nprotests throughout the country, and that various Senators and Members\r\nof the House of Representatives had entered strong protests with the\r\nSecretary of Agriculture against it. A number of these protests have\r\ncome to my notice, and they take various forms of opposition, but are\r\nall unanimous against the Department of Agriculture offering to the\r\nprospective purchaser any information. Various reasons for their stand\r\nwere given by the protestants, but how flimsy and ridiculous they are\r\nwhen analyzed. Congress for a number of years has been appropriating\r\nmoney and authorizing certain work by the Department of Agriculture. It\r\nis the people's money, and the people's Department, and the information\r\ngathered by the experts in this Department ought to be the people's\r\ninformation, and it ought to be possible for any citizen to write the\r\nDepartment a letter about any proposition that he has received from any\r\nof these various promoters, and have the advice of those who know most\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nI suppose the Department of Agriculture has entirely too many duties to\r\nperform to undertake a work of this kind, but what an inconsistent\r\nposition it is for a Member of Congress, who has been voting for\r\nappropriations to carry on this work, to appeal to the Secretary of\r\nAgriculture to suppress such information in order that some exploiter\r\nmay get somebody's money under false representations. I think if it were\r\npossible today to know the list of concerns and companies who\r\nregistered, directly or through agents, their opposition to this\r\nproposed warning circular, you would have a correct index of the\r\nconcerns good to let alone. For no honest, reputable individual or\r\ncompany need be afraid of the work or suggestions of that great\r\nDepartment. I have the pleasure of knowing many of the officials in the\r\nBureau of Plant Industry, and never anywhere have I seen a body of men\r\nso conscientiously engaged in the work of promoting legitimate\r\nhorticultural and agricultural knowledge. It is the very life of that\r\ngreat Department, and its officers and employees above everyone else are\r\nmost interested in seeing the land produce the most and best that it can\r\nbe made to produce, and they are best qualified to pass upon these\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nMost of the questions in these various schemes are questions of soil and\r\nhorticulture. One letter in opposition to the Agricultural Department's\r\nattitude, that was brought to my attention, stated that crops varied\r\nunder different conditions, and that no one was able to tell what a\r\ncertain soil would or would not produce throughout a period of years,\r\nand intimated that the Department of Agriculture might mislead the\r\npublic; and yet the concern that sent it printed columns of figures\r\nguaranteeing returns from pecans and Satsuma oranges in a section where\r\norange growing is of very doubtful possibility. Boiling down these\r\nobjections by the promoters, they come to simply this: That the\r\nAgricultural Department, with no motive but to tell the truth, and with\r\nits corps of trained experts, might mislead the public, but they (the\r\npromoters) could not possibly be mistaken in their fabulous figures\r\ncompiled for the purpose of getting money from some misinformed victim.\r\n\r\nProxy farming never was a success and I do not think it ever will be.\r\nOne of my friends told me a short time ago of a very successful young\r\npecan orchard on the gulf coast. Upon inquiry I found that it was of\r\nreasonable size, nine years old, and that the owner had lived in it nine\r\nyears. It was not 500 acres in extent, or 1,000 acres, or 2,000 acres,\r\nbut about 20 acres. Last summer I went into a beautiful apple orchard in\r\nSouthern Indiana and saw about forty acres of trees bending to the\r\nground with delicious Grimes Golden apples. On that particular day there\r\nwere great crowds of people walking among the trees and admiring the\r\nfruit. I too walked among the trees a short time, but of greater\r\ninterest to me than the trees was the old, gray-haired man who had made\r\nthe orchard. The trees could not talk, but he could, and he told the\r\nstory of the years of care, and diligence, and work, and thought, and\r\npatience, that showed why it is not possible to cover the mountains of a\r\nstate with orchards bringing almost immediate and fabulous incomes.\r\n\r\nSome time ago I stood talking to the old superintendent of the Botanical\r\nGarden in Washington--William R. Smith, now deceased--and while\r\ndiscussing with him the requisites for tree culture, he said \"Young man,\r\nyou have left out the most important one of them all,\" When I asked him\r\nwhat I had left out, he said \"above all things it takes the eye of the\r\nmaster.\" So it does, and the master is he whose vigilance is continual,\r\nwho watches each tree as if it were a growing child--as indeed it is, a\r\nchild of the forests--who has the care and the patience, and who is not\r\ndazzled by the glitter of the dollar, but who loves trees because they\r\nare trees.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, one can figure great successes in big horticultural\r\ndevelopment propositions, but these figures rest upon theory and not\r\nfact. It would be difficult to state all the reasons why I have a firm\r\nconviction that such big schemes of every kind will fall, but I believe\r\nthis conviction is shared by the foremost thinkers in the horticultural\r\nworld. A four-year-old boy was once taken to see the animals in a\r\ncircus. He was very much interested, but, when shown the tremendous\r\nelephant, shook his head and said \"he is too big.\"\r\n\r\nA small grove properly handled ought to be an excellent investment. The\r\nvarious uncertainties and vicissitudes involved can, in a degree, be\r\ncompensated for by great care; and I suppose it would be possible even\r\nwith some of these big schemes--by placing enough money behind them--to\r\ninsure a fair degree of success. It must be borne in mind, however, that\r\nthese promoters, of whom we have been speaking, are not so much\r\nconcerned in the successful orchard as they are in big salaries and\r\nprofits, and, if one has money enough to pay big salaries and profits,\r\nand still pay for the proper care of the orchard, then he does not need\r\nan orchard. Most of these promoters charge too much for a proper and\r\nhonest development alone, and too little for the proper development plus\r\nthe profits and salaries of the promoters. I wish it were not so. I wish\r\nthe old earth could be made to smile bountiful crops without such\r\nexpensive tickling, but this is one of the checks and balances that\r\nnature places upon her great storehouse of wealth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: This is a matter of very great importance and I hope we\r\nshall have a good discussion, from a practical point of view, by men who\r\nknow about fraudulent promotions and their effect. We ought to go on\r\nrecord in this matter right now. I know of numbers of teachers, doctors\r\nand other poor people who have put money into nut promotion schemes\r\nwithout knowing anything about the ultimate prospect of profit.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutt: One noticeable thing about the promoter's literature is that\r\nhe never knows anything about crop failure, and in the agricultural and\r\nhorticultural world that is a thing that is painfully evident to a man\r\nwho has been in business a great length of time. In the promoter's\r\nliterature it is just a matter of multiplication; if one tree will\r\nproduce so much in a year, a hundred trees will produce a hundred times\r\nas much. I got a letter the other day from Mr. S. H. James, of Beaumont,\r\nLouisiana, and he said, \"I have been very fortunate, I have actually had\r\ntwo good crops in succession,\" and when you come to compare that with\r\nthe promoter's literature--why he knows no such thing as crop failure.\r\nAnybody who knows anything about agricultural or horticultural work\r\nknows that we have winter and floods and everything else to contend\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Someone might tell us about failures they happen to know\r\nof in promotion schemes.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith: I would like to ask if Mr. Littlepage isn't going to open up\r\nthat barrel of actual facts that he has about yields?\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: Mr. President, I didn't know that I had a whole barrel\r\nof actual facts. When I started in several years ago a barrel wouldn't\r\nhave held all of them, but I think that now I could put the actual facts\r\nin a thimble. I've got several barrels of good pecans, however, I'd like\r\nto open up and let Mr. Smith sample if he wants to.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Let's hear about frauds from someone who knows how the\r\nland was managed and how the trees were managed and how it actually\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Duzee: Mr. President, I feel that I ought to say something,\r\nfirst in commendation of the paper itself. It is a question how far we,\r\nas an Association, are responsible for the care of our fellowmen, but at\r\nthis period when the industry is new, I feel that it is a very\r\nlegitimate thing for us to do a little work to try and prevent these\r\npeople from preying upon our fellowmen. The president remarked this\r\nmorning that something was an evidence of the tremendous waste in\r\nNature. It is true, Nature, in building a forest, wastes a vast amount\r\nof time and energy. These people who are preying upon the nut industry\r\ntoday find as their victims the weaklings which Nature buries in the\r\nforest. Those things are incidental and we must expect them, but I feel\r\nthat a paper of this kind, at this time, is a very valuable thing and I\r\nhope it will receive wide publication. We cannot say too much to\r\ndiscourage this sort of thing. Now, to respond, in a measure, to the\r\nPresident's request for actual facts, I am confronted with this\r\nproposition, that some of the men who have made the greatest failures\r\nare men who have done so through ignorance. They are honest men, they\r\nare personal friends of mine. I don't care to go too much into details,\r\nbecause they are just as sorry today as I am, but I have seen this done.\r\nI have seen hundreds of acres of nut orchards in the South planted with\r\nthe culls from nurseries bought at a very low figure. I have seen these\r\ntrees neglected absolutely, not in one case but in many cases. I have\r\nseen the weeds as high as the trees at the time when a telegram was\r\nreceived by the the local agent that a carload of the purchasers of\r\nthese tracts was about to leave to look over their property. I have seen\r\nthe local manager hustle out, when he got that telegram, and hire every\r\nmule in the community to come in and, with a plow, throw a furrow or two\r\nto the rows of trees so that they could be distinguished from the weeds\r\nthey were growing among. As Mr. Littlepage has said, there can be no\r\nsuccess in such operations; and I feel, looking at it in a very broad\r\nway, that this is a very good time to emphasize the point that those of\r\nus who have the greatest experience in the growing of nut trees do not\r\nfeel that these enterprises are legitimate, or that they promise very\r\nmuch success. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMr. Pomeroy: I live just a short distance from Buffalo. A few months\r\nago--I got it on the very best authority--there was some salesman in\r\nBuffalo who didn't have time to call on all those who wanted to give him\r\nmoney for pecan propositions. He didn't have time, Doctor, he just had\r\nto skip hundreds of them, he said; he was just going from one place to\r\nanother, making his collections. Buffalo is a city of only about 450,000\r\npeople and there must be some money being collected and sent in to\r\nsomebody.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Very glad to hear of that instance; let's hear of others.\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: I would like, if possible, to answer Mr. Smith's\r\nquestion. I didn't know that he referred to facts about these\r\npromotions, I thought perhaps he meant facts about nut growing.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith: You said you had made inquiries as to nuts, harvest yields,\r\norchard yields; it was those, particularly, that I had in mind.\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: Oh well, I could give those to you readily. There are\r\nsome very promising orchards, making a good showing under investigation,\r\nhandled under proper conditions and of proper size. I would not want to\r\nsay that those things are not possible. Talking specifically of these\r\novergrown schemes, one of them is recalled to my mind, a development\r\ncompany in southern Georgia, that advertises very alluringly. It set out\r\none year a lot of culls; they all died. I am told that they went out the\r\nsecond year and, without any further preparation, dug holes and set out\r\nanother lot of culls. They too died; and then they went out the third\r\nyear and planted nuts, and those trees, at the end of a year's growth,\r\nwere perhaps six or seven inches high, and the salesman from that\r\ncompany, I understood, took one of the prospective purchasers over into\r\na fine grove owned by another man on the opposite side of the road, and\r\nlet him pick out his five acres from the orchard across the road. That's\r\none type I could multiply indefinitely.\r\n\r\nMr. W. C. Reed: I think this is a very important matter. As a nursery\r\nman who has sold a great many trees to promoting companies, I want to\r\nsay that I have never, with one exception, seen an orchard that has been\r\na success, but I have seen hundreds of failures, some of them where they\r\nhave set out orchards of 150,000 trees and sold them off in one and ten\r\nacre tracts, and in only one case have I seen a success. I think these\r\npromotions should be avoided by the nut growers of the North.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: This is very valuable information, coming from a dealer.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Duzee: I have found this in the yields of my orchards. Six or\r\nseven or eight years ago, I discounted every source of information that\r\nI could have access to, as to yields, brought them to a conservative\r\npoint, submitted them to the best informed men in the United States, and\r\nthen divided those figures by five as my estimate of what I might hope\r\nto accomplish as my orchards came into bearing. I have since been\r\nobliged to find some excuses for failing to even approximate those\r\nconservative figures. I had this year in our orchard, a 35 acre plot of\r\nFrotscher trees which is one of the most promising varieties, six years\r\nof age, and there were not five pounds of nuts in the whole plot. I have\r\nhad an orchard of 36 acres, mostly Frotscher and Stewart, go through its\r\nsixth year with less than 200 pounds of nuts to the entire orchard. I\r\nhave another orchard of 30 acres which in its sixth year has produced\r\nless than 100 pounds of nuts. Now many of these promoters guarantee to\r\ntake care of these orchards, which they are selling, for 10 per cent or\r\n20 per cent, or even half the proceeds of those orchards, from the fifth\r\nyear. You can see readily that the entire crop of such orchards as I\r\nhave been able to produce, would not begin to pay their running expenses\r\nthe sixth and seventh year.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: You took good care of yours?\r\n\r\nMr. Van Duzee: I think so. I think there are many gentlemen in the\r\naudience who have been through them, and it is conceded that my orchards\r\nare at least fairly good representatives of what can be done under\r\nnormal conditions.\r\n\r\nMr. Corsan: Are yours southern orchards?\r\n\r\nMr. Van Duzee: These pecan orchards are in south-western Georgia.\r\n\r\nMr. Corsan: The Northern Nut Growers Association, as I understand, is a\r\ncollection of men who are interested in finding out what we can do in\r\nthe way of growing nuts for the North. We go to the markets and see\r\nbaskets of cocoanuts, Brazil nuts, California walnuts, but no nuts\r\ngrowing for the market around our neighborhood. In my own city, Toronto,\r\nI can see some nut trees because I look very closely at everything, but\r\nthe average person cannot see them because they are very few. I have a\r\nnumber of experiments on hand. If I succeed in even one of these\r\nexperiments, I am satisfied to spend my whole life at it. I am not\r\nnervous, I can watch a hickory tree grow. (Laughter.) I want to grow\r\nsome nuts for the next generation. I haven't the slightest thought of\r\nmaking a copper of money out of it but I am going to enjoy the thing,\r\nand that's the idea of the Northern Nut Growers Association, or else I\r\nhave made a mistake.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Is there any further discussion on the matter of frauds?\r\nDoes anyone else wish to speak on this subject?\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: It is indeed very gratifying to hear the President of\r\nthe National Nut Growers' Association, Col. Van Duzee, speak on this\r\nsubject and to have the honor of having him with us as a member of our\r\nAssociation. It is gratifying to have him come out in such strong terms\r\non this question. It has always been his policy and his reputation, so\r\nfar as I have heard, to stand for what is best and squarest in nut\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: The paper of Mr. Littlepage is one of very great\r\nimportance, because the number of frauds associated with an enterprise\r\nis an indication of the fundamental value of the cause. These fraudulent\r\nnut promoters capitalize the enthusiasm of people who want to get back\r\nto the land, just as porters at the hotels capitalize the joy of a newly\r\nmarried couple. (Laughter.) We have in this \"back-to-the-land\" movement,\r\na bit of philosophy of fundamental character which includes the idea of\r\npreservation of the race. Preservation of the race!--why so? Nature made\r\nman a gregarious species and, being gregarious, he has a tendency to\r\ndevelop the urban habit. Developing the urban habit, he fails to oxidize\r\nhis proteins and toxins. Failing to oxidize his proteins and toxins, he\r\ndegenerates. Recognizing the degenerating influence of urban life, by\r\nmeans of his intelligence he has placed within his consciousness that\r\nautomatic arrangement, as good as the automatic arrangement which turns\r\nwater on to a boiler, which says to him, \"go out and oxidize your\r\nproteins and toxins.\" That is what \"back-to-the-land\" means. You've got\r\nto begin from this fundamental point. Now then, if this represents a\r\nfundamental trait in the character of our species and we are acting in\r\nresponse to a natural law, then must we be doubly careful about having\r\nour good intentions, our good methods, halted by unwisdom. That brings\r\nto mind the point made about our present Secretary of Agriculture. I am\r\nvery glad this has been made a matter of record here, for I am sorry to\r\nsay that in connection with another subject--(health matters)--wherever\r\nthere has been opportunity for the Secretary to act, he has decided as a\r\nmatter of policy on the side of capital and against the side of public\r\ninterest. Almost every time, so far as we have a record of the action of\r\nthe present Secretary of Agriculture and of Dunlap and McCabe, his\r\nassistants. We ought to state here, in connection with fraudulent nut\r\npromotions, that he has acted in favor of capital and against the public\r\ninterest if it is true. It ought to go as a matter of record from this\r\nAssociation. We may be bold in this matter, but we should be righteously\r\nbold because we are speaking for the public interest ourselves. We have\r\nnothing to gain; there is nothing selfish about this organization. We\r\nmay be kindly and say that the Secretary is at the mercy of shrewder\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nMr. Corsan says that we are interested in scientific work only. That is\r\ntrue at the present time, because all progress must be from a scientific\r\nbasis. If our care in managing experiments is such that we cannot avoid\r\ngetting rich, we will accept the result. (Laughter.) I am glad that in\r\nconnection with this discussion Mr. Corsan made one epigrammatic\r\nremark,--that he was not nervous and could watch a hickory tree grow. I\r\ntell you there's a lot of wit in that.\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: He has good eyesight, Mr. President.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: The reason why we have so many fraudulent promotions is\r\nlargely because of our American temperament; we are so nervous that we\r\ncan't watch a hickory tree grow. In matters of public health, our\r\nSecretary of Agriculture has prevented actual criminals from being\r\nbrought to justice--he made that his policy.\r\n\r\nI think those are the points that I wish to make in commenting upon Mr.\r\nLittlepage's paper and if he will make any concluding remarks we will be\r\nvery glad to hear them. In regard to Mr. Hutt's suggestion that we\r\ncannot count on crop success or crop failure mathematically--now, there\r\nare fortunes to be made from the proper management of good nut orchards.\r\nWe know of orchards where very large incomes are at present being made,\r\nand I am very glad that the sense and sentiment of this meeting is\r\nagainst quotation of that feature. I have not heard here one word in\r\nquotation of orchards which bring incomes of $10,000 a year or more from\r\nvarious kinds of nuts, and we know there are many such orchards. It is\r\nthe failures upon which we should concentrate our attentions right now,\r\nand the reason for failure is not that nut growing is not going to make\r\nprogress but that we cannot count on our nuts from a mathematical basis.\r\nOne of my friends, an old Frenchman, became very enthusiastic about\r\nraising poultry. He sent out requests for circulars to every poultry\r\nfancier who published circulars, and I will wager that he got 50 per\r\ncent of answers to his requests for circulars about fancy poultry. He\r\nbegan to raise chickens, and my father-in-law met him on the street one\r\nday and asked how he was getting on with his pullets that were going to\r\nlay so many eggs. \"Oh,\" he said, \"Ze trouble is with ze pullet; she no\r\nunderstand mathematique like ze fancier. If I have one pullet, she lay\r\none egg every day; if I have two pullet, _perhaps_ she lay two egg every\r\nday, and if I have three pullet, she _nevaire_ lay three egg every day.\"\r\n(Laughter.) Now I think that the remaining time this morning we had\r\nbetter devote to the executive session, then we had better meet at two\r\no'clock for the election of our committee. The meeting then is at\r\npresent adjourned, with the exception of those who will take part in the\r\nexecutive session, and we will meet again at two P. M. There is one\r\npoint I wanted to make in connection with Col. Van Duzee's remarks that\r\na certain number of really honest men have allowed their names to be\r\nused in connection with promotion propositions. Men who are quite\r\nskillful at learning the use of names, have gotten men of good\r\nintentions and kindly interest, I know, to lend their names as even\r\nofficials of nut promotion companies. Besides that, a good deal of\r\ngarbled literature of recommendation has gone out in their circulars. I\r\nhave had a number of circulars sent to me quoting abstract remarks that\r\nI had made relative to nut culture in general, and this has been applied\r\nconcretely in circulars; the context did not go with it. I asked a\r\nlawyer what I could do about it, and after going over the question he\r\nsaid that I probably was powerless.\r\n\r\nAfter announcements by the Secretary, the convention took a recess until\r\n2 P. M., at which time it was called to order by President Morris and\r\nthe regular program was resumed as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: The executive session will be held after the meeting, as\r\nmany are here to hear the paper on the chestnut blight, so we will\r\nproceed at once to the order of business and listen to the first paper\r\nby Mr. Rockey.\r\n\r\nMr. Rockey: This paper deals more particularly with the work that has\r\nbeen done in Pennsylvania. But what has been done here may be considered\r\nto be typical of what has been done elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT WORK ON THE CHESTNUT BLIGHT\r\n\r\nKELLER E. ROCKEY\r\n\r\nForester in charge of Demonstration Work, Pennsylvania Chestnut Tree\r\nBlight Commission\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the blight, briefly outlined, is as follows:\r\n\r\nIn 1904 the diseased condition of the chestnut trees around New York\r\nCity was noted and an examination of them showed that they were being\r\nattacked by a disease at that time unknown. Investigations since then\r\nhave shown that the blight had been at work there and elsewhere for a\r\nnumber of years before that time, but it has been impossible to\r\ndetermine just when it first appeared or where. The disease was studied\r\nand described at that time.\r\n\r\nOn display here are specimens and photographs showing the appearance of\r\nthe blight so that I will not go into that part of the subject in\r\ndetail. I hope that you will notice, however, the symptoms by which the\r\ndisease is recognized: 1st. The small red pustules which produce the\r\nspores and, on rough barked trees, appear only in the crevices. 2nd. The\r\npeculiar mottled appearance of the inner bark of the canker. 3rd. The\r\ndiscoloration of the outer bark. 4th. The danger signals, such as\r\nwithered leaves in summer or persistent leaves or burrs in winter,\r\nsuckers which develop at the base of cankers, and the yellowish cracks\r\nwhich soon appear in the bark over the cankers.\r\n\r\nWorkers in the Bureau of Plant Industry, Washington, D. C., have been\r\nstudying the blight since 1908. In the Spring of 1911, a bill creating\r\nthe commission for the investigation and control of the blight in\r\nPennsylvania was passed, and the active work began in August 1911. The\r\nmethod upon which the Commission is working is outlined in Farmers'\r\nBulletin No. 467, of the Department of Agriculture, and consists briefly\r\nof determining the area of blight infection and in removing diseased\r\ntrees west of a certain line, with the purpose of preventing the western\r\nspread of the blight.\r\n\r\nThis Commission has ascertained as accurately as possible the amount of\r\ninfection in the various parts of the state and the results are given in\r\na map on display here. The state is divided into two districts by a line\r\ndrawn along the western edge of Susquehanna, Wyoming, Columbia, Union,\r\nSnyder, Juniata and Franklin Counties, which is approximately the\r\nwestern line of serious blight infection. West of this line a large\r\nportion of the state has been scouted, and the remainder will be\r\nfinished early in 1913. We have learned by experience that in the\r\nwinter, after the fall of the leaves, the best scouting work can be\r\ndone. Persistent leaves and cankers along the trunk are readily seen,\r\nand more and better work can be accomplished than in the summer, except\r\nwhen the snow is very deep.\r\n\r\nBlight infections have been found in counties adjacent to this line:\r\nalso in Fayette County, near Connellsville, in Warren County, near\r\nWarren, and in Elk County, near St. Mary's. These three infections were\r\ndirectly traceable to infected nursery stock, and in one case the blight\r\nhad spread to adjacent trees. A large area of diseased chestnut in\r\nSomerset County illustrates the harm done by shipping infected nursery\r\nstock. The centre of this infection is a chestnut orchard where about\r\n100 scions from an infected eastern orchard were grafted to native\r\nsprouts in 1908. The percentage of infected trees in the orchard from\r\nwhich the scions were obtained, according to a count made this Fall,\r\naverages 80 per cent. Evidently these scions brought the disease into\r\nthis region, for the grafts have all been killed by the blight and every\r\ntree in the orchard is killed or infected by disease. On adjoining\r\ntracts over 5,400 infected trees have been cut, and there are a number\r\nof others in process of removal, radiating in all directions from the\r\norchard as a center to a distance of three miles. Another infection of\r\n143 trees was found in Elk County. It is thought that three trees at the\r\ncentre of infection were diseased in 1909, although it is possible that\r\none of these trees was already infected in 1908. In 1910, 27 additional\r\ntrees were infected; in 1911, 50 additional trees, and in 1912, 228\r\nadditional trees. The disease spread in all directions from the center\r\nof infection to a distance of 700 feet.\r\n\r\nThese infections are interesting in showing the rate at which the blight\r\nmay travel in healthy timber.\r\n\r\nThese infections have all been removed and it is the expectation that by\r\nthe end of January 1913 all scattered spot infections will be removed\r\nfrom the territory west of the line previously mentioned, and that, to\r\nthe best of our knowledge, these western counties will be free from\r\nblight. In 1913 the field force will be concentrated on the advance line\r\nand the work will be carried eastward. The Commission has the power to\r\ncompel the removal of infected trees. In the western part of the state\r\nthis power has been exercised in the few cases where it was necessary.\r\nAs a rule, however, the owners are not only willing but anxious to get\r\nrid of the infected trees, and our field men are given hearty support by\r\nindividuals, granges and other organizations. The timber owners of Elk\r\nCounty had printed and posted an announcement that the chestnut blight\r\nhad been found in the locality and warned the people to be on the\r\nlook-out for it. In addition the Commission has had a man, for a short\r\ntime at least, in each of the eastern counties of the state, and their\r\ntime has been taken up principally by those who requested inspections of\r\ntimber with the view of determining the percentage of blight infection\r\nand the best method to be pursued in combating it and realizing on their\r\ntimber. Our men are all deputy wardens, with the authority which is\r\nattached to this office, and are instructed to do their utmost to\r\nprevent fire damage.\r\n\r\nAn exhibit which consists of specimens showing the blight in various\r\nstages together with photographs, literature, etc., was placed in about\r\n30 of the county fairs throughout the state. The appreciation of the\r\npublic has been so clearly shown that next year it is the intention of\r\nthe Commission to continue and perhaps increase this phase of the work,\r\nand to place large permanent displays at the Commercial Museum,\r\nPhiladelphia, the State Capitol, Harrisburg, and other places.\r\n\r\nMany of the Annual Teachers' Institutes have been reached with a display\r\nand lecture. We have arranged also to have a speaker at fully one\r\nhundred of the Farmers' Institutes this winter. We are also arranging to\r\nhave a permanent display at many of the public schools, normal schools\r\nand colleges, where instruction on the blight is given. An effort was\r\nmade last winter to enlist the service of the boy scouts and we are\r\nindebted to them for considerable work, chiefly in an educational way.\r\nThe successful outcome of all our work will depend in a large measure\r\nupon the owners themselves, and it is our purpose to give them all the\r\ninformation possible upon the whole subject.\r\n\r\nThe Commission established a Department of Utilization which is\r\ncollecting information on the various industries which use or might use\r\nchestnut wood, listing the buyers and owners of chestnut wood, thus\r\nassisting owners of blighted chestnut trees in marketing their timber to\r\nthe best advantage. The Department is trying to increase the use of\r\nchestnut wood by calling attention to its many good qualities, and thus\r\nutilize the large quantity which must necessarily be thrown upon the\r\nmarket. There has been more or less discrimination against blighted\r\nchestnut timber. This has been in many cases unjust, since the blight\r\ndoes not injure the value of the wood for most purposes for which it is\r\nused. However, the owners sometimes fail to realize that the blight\r\ncankers are the most favorable places for the entrance of the borers,\r\nand that where a large number of trees are being considered, a\r\npercentage of them will be materially injured by insects which follow\r\nblight infection. Where telegraph poles are barked, it is often seen\r\nthat borers have attacked the wood under blight cankers, and have not\r\ntouched any other part of the tree. All blighted timber should be cut\r\nbefore death to realize its best value, since insects and\r\nwood-destroying fungi cause the very rapid deterioration of dead,\r\nstanding timber. There has been a good market in almost every locality\r\nfor poles, ties and the better grades of lumber. Cordwood presents the\r\ndifficult problem of disposal. The best market for this is in the\r\ncentral part of the state, at the extract plants. The Commission has\r\nsecured from the Pennsylvania R. R. a special tariff on blighted\r\nchestnut cordwood so that this product may be profitably shipped from\r\ngreater distances than before.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has inspected all chestnut nursery stock shipped from\r\nnurseries within the state and has also provided for inspection of all\r\nchestnut stock entering the state. This should prevent a repetition of\r\ninfections in the western part of the state which might destroy millions\r\nof dollars worth of timber.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time publications have been and will be issued by the\r\nCommission, which are obtained free of charge upon request, or they may\r\nbe consulted in the leading libraries throughout the state.\r\n\r\nAn appropriation for $80,000 was given by the last Congress for\r\nscientific research work upon the blight disease and work is being\r\ncarried out in cooperation with the various states. Several of the\r\nGovernment investigators are now at work upon our force. Some of the\r\nmost important unsolved scientific problems of the blight, as given by\r\nSecretary Wilson, in his message, to Congress, are as follows:--\r\n\r\nFirst, the relation of the disease to climate.\r\n\r\nSecond, the relation of the parasite to the varying tannin content of\r\nthe tree.\r\n\r\nThird, the origin of the disease.\r\n\r\nFourth, relation of birds and insects to the dissemination of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nFifth, the nature and degree of resistance of the Asiatic species.\r\nAnother problem in relation to tree treatment may be added, that is, the\r\nrelation of spores and mycelium to toxic agents.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Commission maintained laboratories during the summer at\r\nCharter Oak, Centre County, and at Mt. Gretna, Lebanon County. The\r\nlatter has been moved to Franklin and Marshall College, Lancaster, for\r\nthe winter. We have also had a laboratory at the University of\r\nPennsylvania, which has been greatly enlarged this fall.\r\n\r\nThe number of people who informed us that they had discovered a sure\r\n\"cure\" for the blight made it necessary to obtain an orchard near\r\nPhiladelphia where all such discoverers were given an opportunity to\r\ndemonstrate the efficacy of their remedies. It might be noted that in\r\nevery case the blight is thriving as usual. These cures consisted\r\nlargely of an injection of a toxic principle by some means into the\r\ncirculation of the tree. In some cases this was accompanied by a\r\nfertilizer of some kind, and this fertilizer may account for the\r\napparently improved condition of the tree in some cases, after such\r\nremedies were used, since the growth was increased and the leaves and\r\nbranches had a healthier appearance. This increased growth has not had\r\nany appreciable effect upon the rapidity of spread of the blight\r\nmycelium. As the experiments are not officially finished and recorded it\r\nis too early to give any further data. Our pathologists have also\r\nconducted experiments in this same line but no medicinal remedy or\r\nfertilizer has yet been found.\r\n\r\nThe varying chemical constituents of chestnut trees, principally tannic\r\nacid, have often been suggested in regard to the origin and spread of\r\nthe blight. Investigators are now working along this line and we hope,\r\nfor valuable results before long.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the disease, as already stated, is something of a mystery,\r\nand there is as yet no generally accepted theory, although many people\r\nhave very pronounced views on the subject. Many puzzling facts have been\r\nnoted since investigating the disease in Pennsylvania, among them being\r\nthe large percentage of infection in eastern York and southern Lancaster\r\ncounties, the relative small percentage in certain localities around\r\nwhich the blight is generally prevalent, and recent infections found in\r\nWarren and other western counties, a great distance from what is known\r\nas the western advance line of the disease.\r\n\r\nOur pathologists have reported some very interesting facts in regard to\r\nthe dissemination of the blight. In the preliminary report of the\r\nsummer's work at our field laboratories the results tend to show:\r\n\r\nFirst, the prolific ascospore stage is very important in causing the\r\nspread of the blight, the spores at this stage being forcibly ejected\r\nfrom the pustules and borne through the air for some distance. This\r\nejection of spores takes place under natural field conditions only when\r\nthe bark has been soaked by rain, but the expulsion of spores is also\r\ndependent upon temperature conditions and ceases entirely at\r\ntemperatures from 42 to 46 degrees F. and below.\r\n\r\nSecond, the wind plays a large part in local ascospore dissemination.\r\n\r\nThird, birds and insects (except ants) are apparently of very little\r\nimportance in the dissemination of the blight except in providing\r\nwounds. Further investigations of the importance of ants is being made\r\nduring the present winter.\r\n\r\nSeveral kinds of beetles have been observed eating the pustules and are\r\nin this way beneficial, since tests show that they digest and destroy\r\nthe spores. It has also been suggested by workers in the Bureau of\r\nEntomology that such beetles, which are of several kinds, may be of\r\nvalue in the attempt to control the disease. These are perhaps the only\r\nnatural enemies discovered to date.\r\n\r\nThe proper classification of the chestnut blight fungus has also been\r\nthe subject of much discussion. Last winter specimens of what in\r\nexternal characteristics appeared to be Diaporthe parasitica were found\r\nin western Pennsylvania, Virginia and elsewhere, growing upon chestnut,\r\noak and other species. This condition was puzzling and the subject of\r\nsome controversy. It has been found, however, that this fungus, called\r\nthe \"Connellsville fungus,\" is a distinct species closely related to the\r\ntrue blight fungus, being, however, entirely saprophytic. Cultural\r\ndistinctions are apparent and the ascospores differ in size and shape so\r\nthat no further confusion need occur.\r\n\r\nUpon the question of immunity of certain kinds of Asiatic stock, there\r\nis very little to report beyond what was known one year ago. In the\r\ninvestigations made the work has been hampered by the fact that much of\r\nthe so-called Japanese stock is in reality a hybrid of European or\r\nAmerican species. In 1909, 45 Japanese seedling trees were set out at\r\nGap, Lancaster Co., for experimentation along this line. A recent\r\nexamination showed that 90 per cent are infected. Concerning the variety\r\nor purity of this stock, I have not been informed. Our force as well as\r\nothers are at work upon the problem which will require many years'\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nPrevious investigations seem to show that certain pure strains of\r\nJapanese and Korean chestnut are resistant to the blight. Blight cankers\r\nmay be found upon them but they are less easily infected and suffer less\r\nthan the more susceptible varieties. With this as a working basis,\r\nconsidering the results that have been attained in other fruit by\r\nselection and hybridization, the situation is hopeful. Prof. Collins\r\nsaid at the Harrisburg Conference in February that \"There is no reason\r\nto doubt that we may eventually see an immune hybrid chestnut that will\r\nrival the American chestnut in flavor and the Paragon in size\".\r\n\r\nIn southern Europe chestnut orcharding is a well established and\r\nprofitable industry. In the United States chestnuts have been considered\r\na marketable commodity ever since the Indians carried them to the\r\nsettlements and traded them for knives and trinkets. The demand has\r\nalways exceeded the supply and at the present time about $2,000,000\r\nworth of nuts are imported from Europe annually. With the development of\r\nthe better varieties of the American nut has come an increased activity\r\nin the United States and the chestnut orchard industry promises to\r\nbecome one of very large importance. It has an added advantage that the\r\ntrees can be grown upon the poorer types of soil which are not adaptable\r\nfor farming or the raising of other fruit.\r\n\r\nAt the present time there are in what is known as the blight area of\r\nPennsylvania, or eastern half of the State, about 100 orchards ranging\r\nfrom 12 trees up to 400 acres in extent. These orchards are in varying\r\nstages of blight infection, some of them being almost entirely free, due\r\nto the attention which has been given them. In order to protect such\r\norchards the Commission is compelling the removal of infected trees\r\nwithin a certain radius of them.\r\n\r\nAs you know the blight has been a very serious factor in this industry.\r\nSome of the orchards have been completely annihilated and the income\r\nreduced from several thousand or more dollars per year to nothing.\r\nWhether or not the blight will completely wipe out the orcharding\r\nindustry is a subject of large importance. Personally I believe that\r\nchestnuts will be raised commercially in Pennsylvania in increased\r\nabundance, and as the various phases of the blight subject are brought\r\nto light, keeping the disease under control can be more easily\r\naccomplished. At the present time this is being done in certain orchards\r\nby the present methods of examining the trees often, treating each\r\ninfection, or removing the tree. If this policy is successfully pursued\r\nfor several more years it will demonstrate conclusively that chestnuts\r\ncan be grown in spite of the blight and this will mean an opportunity to\r\nuse vast areas of waste land in Pennsylvania and in the other states, in\r\na highly profitable manner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: The subject of the next paper is Some Problems in the\r\nTreatment of the Chestnut. It will be presented by Mr. Pierce, after\r\nwhich we will have a general discussion of the entire subject.\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce: Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen: I see that, as we wrote\r\nour papers separately, some of the things I had in mind will be similar\r\nto those Mr. Rockey had.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME PROBLEMS IN THE TREATMENT OF DISEASED CHESTNUT TREES\r\n\r\nBY ROY G. PIERCE\r\n\r\nTree Surgeon, Pennsylvania Chestnut Tree Blight Commission\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problems that present themselves to the growers of chestnut trees\r\nconcerning the present disease may be summed up under three heads:\r\nfirst, what the disease is, how it is caused, and how it may be\r\nrecognized; second, what is to be done with diseased trees to bring them\r\nto health or to prevent them from infecting other healthy trees nearby;\r\nthird, what means in the future can be undertaken to keep a tree\r\nhealthy, that is, to prevent reinfection.\r\n\r\nFirst, what the disease is, how it is caused, and how it may be\r\nrecognized. The disease known as the chestnut tree blight is caused by\r\nthe fungus, _Diaporthe parasitica_, which usually finds entrance to the\r\ntree through wounds in the bark. The mycelium or mass of fungous\r\nfilaments gradually spreads through the bark in much the same manner as\r\nmold spreads over and through a piece of bread, even penetrating the\r\nwood to a depth of sometimes five annual rings. The spread of the\r\nfungus, resulting in the cutting off of the sap flow, is the immediate\r\ncause of the wilting and dying of the leaves and branch above the point\r\nof girdling. This wilting of the leaves, followed later by the death of\r\none branch after another as the fungus spreads, has given rise to the\r\nterm \"blight\" of the chestnut trees.\r\n\r\nThe danger signals which the chestnut tree displays when diseased are\r\nnot a few. In summer, when the tree is first affected, the leaves turn\r\nyellow-green and wilt, later turning brown. Small burs and withered\r\nleaves retained in winter are some signs of the diseased condition of\r\nthe tree. At the base of the blighted part a lesion, or reddish brown\r\ncanker, is usually found. This lesion may be a sunken area or, as is\r\nfrequently the case, a greatly enlarged swelling, known as a\r\nhypertrophy. After a branch has become completely girdled sprouts or\r\nsuckers are very apt to be found below the point of girdling. In old\r\nfurrowed bark on the main trunk of the tree the presence of the disease\r\nis seen in the reddish brown spore-bearing pustules in the fissures. In\r\ndetermining the presence of the fungus in the furrowed bark of old\r\ntrees, one must learn to recognize the difference between the light\r\nbrown color characteristic of fissures in healthy growing bark, and the\r\nreddish brown color of the fungus. When the disease has been present\r\nseveral years the bark completely rots and shrinks away from the wood,\r\nand when the bark is struck with an axe a hollow sound is produced.\r\n\r\nMany of the owners of chestnut trees throughout Pennsylvania do not\r\nacknowledge that a fungus is causing the death of the trees. They state\r\nthat since they have found white grubs or the larvae of beetles in\r\nnearly every tree that dies, that it has been the larvae that killed the\r\ntree. It is acknowledged that generally white grubs are found in dying\r\nchestnut trees, and that in nearly all of the large cankers or lesions\r\nthese grubs are present. However, if one will take the pains to examine\r\nthe small twigs and branches or the new shoots rising from the stumps,\r\nthat are diseased, he will not find the grubs present.\r\n\r\nSecond, what is to be done with diseased trees to bring them back to\r\nhealth or to prevent them from infecting other healthy trees nearby. To\r\nbring the trees back to health implies that the disease can be cured.\r\nThis is not always true for the tree may be already nearly girdled, when\r\nthe disease is first noticed. A tree taken in time, however, may have\r\nits life prolonged indefinitely though it may have the blight in some\r\nportion of it every year. More particularly does this apply to valuable\r\nornamental and orchard trees.\r\n\r\nProf. J. Franklin Collins, Forest Pathologist in the Department of\r\nAgriculture in Farmer's Bulletin No. 467 on \"The Control of the Chestnut\r\nBark Disease\" gives the following: \"The essentials for the work are a\r\ngouge, a mallet, a pruning knife, a pot of coal tar, and a paint brush.\r\nIn the case of a tall tree a ladder or rope, or both may be necessary\r\nbut under no circumstances should tree climbers be used, as they cause\r\nwounds which are very favorable places for infection. Sometimes an axe,\r\na saw, and a long-handled tree pruner are convenient auxiliary\r\ninstruments, though practically all the cutting recommended can be done\r\nwith a gouge with a cutting edge of 1 or 1-1/2 inches. All cutting\r\ninstruments should be kept very sharp, so that a clean smooth cut may be\r\nmade at all times.\"\r\n\r\nAll of the discolored diseased areas in the tree should be removed.\r\nSmall branches or twigs nearly girdled are best cut off. Cankers in the\r\nmain trunk or on limbs should be gouged out. Carefulness is the prime\r\nrequisite in this work. If the disease has completely killed the\r\ncambium, the bark should be entirely removed as well as several layers\r\nof wood beneath the canker. By frequent examination, however, diseased\r\nspots may be found on the tree where the mycelium of the fungus is still\r\nin the upper layers of the bark. It is not necessary then to cut clear\r\nto the wood, but the discolored outer bark may be removed and a layer of\r\nhealthy inner bark left beneath the cut. The sap may still flow through\r\nthis layer. The border of the diseased area is quite distinct, but\r\ncutting should not stop here but should be continued beyond the\r\ndiscolored portion into healthy bark, at least an inch. The tools should\r\nbe thoroughly sterilized by immersion in a solution of 1.1000 bichloride\r\nof mercury, or 5 per cent solution of formaldehyde, before cutting into\r\nthe bark outside of the diseased area. Experiments have shown that a\r\ngouge or knife may carry the spores into healthy bark and new infection\r\ntake place. Experiments are being carried on in the laboratory to\r\ndetermine the length of time which spores will live in solutions of\r\ndifferent strengths of fungicides.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that a cut made pointed at the top and bottom heals\r\nmuch faster than one rounded. The edges of the cut should be made with\r\ncare so as not to injure the cambium. The chips of diseased bark and\r\nwood should not be allowed to fall on the ground then to be forgotten. A\r\nbag fastened just below the canker will collect most of this material as\r\nit is gouged out and prevent possible reinfection, which might take\r\nplace if the material were allowed to scatter down the bark. Canvas or\r\nburlap spread around under a small orchard tree might be sufficient to\r\ncatch all of the diseased chips of bark and wood cut out of the lower\r\ninfections. This diseased material should be burned together with\r\nblighted branches. After completely cutting out all of the diseased\r\nparts the cut surfaces should be either sterilized or covered with a\r\nwaterproofing which combines a fungicide with a covering. Among these\r\nmight be mentioned coal tar and creosote, or a mixture of pine tar,\r\nlinseed oil, lamp black and creosote.\r\n\r\nThe trees which have been killed by blight, or nearly girdled, have been\r\noverlooked. These should be cut off close to the ground, the stump\r\npeeled and the bark and unused portions of the tree burned over the\r\nstump. The merchantable parts of the trees should be removed from the\r\nwoods promptly, as all dead unbarked wood furnishes an excellent\r\nbreeding place for the blight fungus.\r\n\r\nThird, what means in the future can be undertaken to keep a tree\r\nhealthy, that is, to prevent reinfection. The spores may be carried by\r\nso many agents that it is difficult to prevent reinfection. However it\r\nis clear that the farther infected products or trees are removed from\r\nhealthy trees the less liable they are to have spores carried to them.\r\nCooperation with nearby owners of diseased trees will help solve this\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nSpraying on a large scale has only been carried on, so far as I know, on\r\nthe estate of Pierre DuPont, Jr., at Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. At\r\nthis place there are many large chestnut trees ranging from sixty to\r\nninety feet in height, many of which were planted some sixty-five years\r\nago. Mr. R. E. Wheeler started the work of cutting out diseased limbs\r\nand cankers in October 1911, and began spraying with Bordeaux mixture in\r\nApril 1912. The formula 5-5-50, five pounds of copper sulphate and five\r\npounds of lime in 50 gallons of water was found to be injurious to the\r\nfoliage in the Spring. This was changed therefore, to 4-5-50, which had\r\none pound less of copper sulphate. This did not seem to injure the\r\nfoliage.\r\n\r\nAbout 70 trees were sprayed twenty times during the season. Nearly all\r\nof these were gone over four times to remove diseased branches and\r\ncankers, once in October 1911, then in early summer and again in\r\nSeptember and November 1912. As an example take tree No. 6 which was\r\nstudied, December 14, 1912. It is 39 inches in diameter at breast\r\nheight, and approximately 70 feet in height. On this one tree six\r\ndiseased limbs were removed, and sixteen cankers were cut out. Of these\r\nsixteen, two infections continued, that is, were not completely cut out,\r\nand had spread; three had infections below old limbs which had been\r\nremoved, and eleven were healing over. This tree was about 1000 feet\r\naway from other badly infected trees, though but 25 feet away from other\r\nchestnut trees in the same row. The experiment of Mr. DuPont in spraying\r\nshows what can be done on valuable lawn trees. On the whole, these trees\r\nlook well and healthy. Trees which were not sprayed over three times and\r\nwere within 50-100 feet from badly blighted trees, became infected in so\r\nmany different places that it will be necessary to remove them.\r\n\r\nOne of the problems to be solved next year will be that of the least\r\nnumber of sprayings which will be effective in preventing new infection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: The question of the chestnut blight is now open for\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: I should like to ask these gentlemen how far west they\r\nhave heard of chestnut blight--that is, heard of it with any degree of\r\nauthenticity, and also whether or not they care to express an opinion as\r\nto what the prospects are in the middle west, say out in Indiana,\r\nIllinois and Ohio?\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce: In answer to that question, I will say that in Pennsylvania\r\nwe have found infections in Wayne County and also in Fayette County,\r\nboth near the western extreme of the state, but those have been attended\r\nto, very largely, and the boundaries closely determined. In Ohio there\r\nhave been several reports of the blight being found, but I don't think\r\neither of the reports have been proven. There has been a fungus that I\r\nhave spoken of as the Connellsville fungus, that has been all around in\r\nthat neighborhood, south-western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Is the Connellsville fungus also _diaporthe parasitica_?\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce: Yes, sir. It was placed by Mr. Anderson, who did the work\r\non that, in the same genus as diaporthe, but he preferred the name\r\n_endothia parasitica_.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: The question is of changing the generic name, from\r\n_diaporthe_, on the basis of the previously established species?\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce: Yes, sir, previously established species of _endothia_. It\r\nis only a suggestion of Mr. Anderson; it was made by him. This was very\r\nsimilar to the true blight fungus and when our men first went out into\r\nthe western part of the State, they reported these various cases that\r\ncame up there as chestnut blight, and none of the pathologists of our\r\nforce then were competent to determine the difference, except that the\r\nfact was noted even then that it was not growing as a parasite in the\r\nsense that the true blight fungus has been growing in the east.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: That may be due to varietal differences, though, rather\r\nthan specific?\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce: Yes, although Mr. Anderson seemed to think it was specific.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Is there any further discussion? The subject is worthy of\r\na good deal of comment.\r\n\r\nMr. Pomeroy: I want to ask the speaker what the approximate cost would\r\nbe for one spraying of a tree about that size, 70 feet in height?\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce: We have photographs on the table there showing our eight\r\nhundred dollar spraying machine, the same kind used in Massachusetts in\r\ngypsy moth work. With this two men can spray about ten such trees in a\r\nday. I haven't got it down in black and white but I figured that, on\r\nthose chestnuts at DuPont's, they sprayed about 600 gallons a day. Ten\r\ntrees a day would make it, say, with a $2.50 man, not very high for a\r\ntree. I think it costs in all something like four dollars a tree during\r\nthe whole season, but that is a very rough estimate and the materials\r\nare not included.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: The cost will have to be calculated on a sentimental basis\r\nfor the ornamental trees, and on a commercial basis for the commercial\r\ntrees. The actual value of the spraying has not yet been determined.\r\nThis spraying cannot reach the mycelium in the cambium layer; if the\r\ndisease has been carried in by a beetle or woodpecker your spraying\r\nwould be ineffective.\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce: Yes indeed, that was just the thought Mr. Galena had,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that they cut out all visible infections and\r\nthe trees were so blue with spray that you could see them for half a\r\nmile.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: But, later on, cracks and squirrel scratches and all sorts\r\nof injuries would allow new spores to be carried in?\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: The future of the chestnut depends so largely on the\r\nconquering of this disease that no other horticultural problem of this\r\nnut is, just at present, imperative. So far as we know, all of the\r\nEuropean and American varieties are highly subject to this disease, so\r\nmuch so that there is no inducement to plant them, and we are waiting\r\nfor Dr. Morris and a few other hybridizers to find some hybrids, or\r\nstraight Japanese varieties, that are of sufficient merit, and of\r\nsufficient degree of resistance to this disease, for us to have a basis\r\nfor building up the future industry. On the tables there are quite a\r\nnumber of exhibits from Mr. Riehl and Mr. Endicott of Illinois. Most of\r\nthem are hybrids between the American and the Japanese species, but, so\r\nfar as we know, they have not been tried in communities where the\r\ndisease prevails. We don't know whether they are resistant or not, as\r\nthey are being grown in a section entirely outside of the area where the\r\nblight exists. I think I am right in that, am I not, Mr. Pierce? Is\r\nthere any chestnut blight in southern Illinois?\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce: There has been none reported.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: I think that the varieties that these men in Indiana have\r\noriginated are the most promising we know of. I think that in examining\r\nthese specimens you will agree that they are of fairly high quality and\r\ngood size, and if they prove to be resistant to the disease much may be\r\nexpected from them.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutt: I have not seen the chestnut blight at all. I hope that it\r\nisn't in our section. I have heard it was brought in from some point but\r\nI do not know whether it was identified exactly as the chestnut blight.\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce: I saw a specimen sent from North Carolina and it proved to\r\nbe the Collinsville fungus.\r\n\r\nMr. Corsan: If you remember reading Fuller's book on nuts, he reported\r\nthat the chestnut blight extended through the Carolinas but said that\r\nchestnuts were still coming from that direction in great abundance. Up\r\nin Canada we haven't the chestnut blight. The chestnut tree runs from\r\nthe Ohio River to the Niagara River but it doesn't cross into Michigan,\r\nexcept along the Michigan Southern and Lake Shore Railroad where some\r\nenterprising gentlemen have planted the chestnut with the tamarack\r\nalternately all the way from Cleveland to Chicago. I examined the state\r\nof Indiana across and from top to bottom several times in the summer and\r\nI never saw any chestnuts there, but I have seen some newly planted\r\nplaces in Michigan; near Battle Creek I saw a farm of about fifty acres.\r\nWe are having up in Ontario, beyond Toronto, a blight that has attacked\r\nthe Lombardy poplar and that looks similar to the chestnut blight. I\r\nhave been watching it for the last ten years and the tree seems to have\r\nat last outlived it. It dies down and then a little sprout comes out\r\nfrom the carcass.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Isn't that the poplar tree borer that always attacks the\r\nLombardy?\r\n\r\nMr. Corsan: Oh no, it's very similar to the chestnut tree blight. We can\r\ngrow chestnut trees all we like but no one has brains enough to grow\r\nthem. The farmers grow pigs and things but don't bother with chestnut\r\ntrees; consequently the chestnut blight does not exist there.\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce: I didn't answer a portion of Mr. Littlepage's question. Mr.\r\nLittlepage asked whether or not the blight might be expected in the\r\nMiddle West. That depends, more or less, upon the results of the work\r\nPennsylvania is now carrying on. If we can keep the disease from\r\nextending through the territory in which we are working, there is a very\r\ngood chance to keep it out of the West. If we are not successful, it may\r\nbe expected to develop, in time, over the whole chestnut range.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a very good opportunity for growing the chestnut\r\ncommercially beyond its present range; that is, where it is so\r\ninfrequent as not to be in danger from infected growths nearby.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern part of the state different people have reported that the\r\nblight seemed to them to be dying out and, a number of these reports\r\ncoming from a certain locality, the Commission decided to investigate\r\none which seemed to be better reported than the others. It was found,\r\nafter a very extensive investigation, that this dying out was true only\r\nin the sense that it was not spreading, perhaps, as fast as it had been\r\nspreading before. The mycelium and the spores were healthy and were\r\naffecting the new trees in quite the same manner as the year before and\r\nas in other parts of the state.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: The question of controlling blight after it has appeared\r\nis of very great consequence. Concerning any commercial proposition\r\nwith chestnuts the people are wide awake to the seriousness of the\r\nblight. They are afraid to go into growing chestnut orchards; they have\r\nhad so many fake propositions in the past in pecan promotions that they\r\nare afraid of chestnuts and everything else. Any proposition for\r\nbringing forward chestnuts commercially must be a plain, simple,\r\nstraightforward statement of the truth, the whole truth and nothing but\r\nthe truth. We are ready, all through the North and East, to raise\r\nhundreds of acres of chestnuts, such as Mr. Reed has spoken about, ones\r\nwhich resist the blight, or ones which resist the blight comparatively\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nLet us consider comparative immunity for a moment. We know how expensive\r\nit is to manage an apple orchard, and yet, with the present high prices,\r\nthe profits on apple orchards, well managed, are great. May we not have\r\nchestnut orchards managed with the same degree of relative expense and\r\nthe same degree of relative profit? I would like very much to hear from\r\nsome of the men who have actually raised chestnuts in orchards\r\nconcerning the relative care of the chestnut compared with the apple,\r\nand the relative profit. I see Col. Sober here; can't you tell us about\r\nyour experience in managing the blight? Can it be managed successfully\r\nin proportion as apple tree parasites are managed?\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: My experience has been this; I have four hundred acres of\r\nchestnuts in bearing. They range from five years to fifteen years old. I\r\nfind that I can control the blight easier than I can control the scale\r\non apple trees. If anyone doesn't believe this I invite him and all to\r\ncome to my place and see for themselves. I think I have nearly one\r\nmillion seedling and grafted paragon trees. I don't think you will find\r\nfifty affected trees on the whole place today. I have men going in every\r\ngrove at the present time who have inspected thousands of trees and\r\nfound seven that had blight on the limbs, so I know what I am speaking\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: What is your method?\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: Cutting out, cutting off anything I see; if it is really\r\nnecessary, cut the tree down; but we don't often find that necessary\r\nbecause just as quick as we see any affected, or any limb dying or dead,\r\nwe cut it off. I had my groves laid out in sections of a hundred feet\r\nwide and numbered; and I had charts made so that they can be inspected\r\nsection by section. In that manner, every tree is inspected. One\r\nindividual will inspect the trunk and another one the top. In each\r\nsection I can show you as far as we have gone. I can show you how many\r\ntrees are in each section and how many affected trees there are in that\r\nsection, or whether there are any or not. I say I can control it easier\r\nthan I can control scale and with less expense and I want that to go on\r\nrecord. There is no question about it. It can be seen at my place. I go\r\nover my groves about four times a year and have been doing it all the\r\ntime, and I don't doubt but that I discovered this disease the first of\r\nanybody in the state, perhaps, in 1902. I was looking around to cut\r\nscions and I saw one tree whose center was dead and around it were the\r\nfinest shoots almost that I had ever seen for grafting purposes. I went\r\nto it and saw the center was dead. I cut some scions and today that is\r\none of the finest trees I've got on my place. From what I know now that\r\nwas a blighted tree.\r\n\r\nA member: Did you paint over the scars?\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: No sir, but we are doing it now, using white lead.\r\n\r\nA member: How much blight is there around you?\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: I am surrounded with it on all sides. Right up against my\r\ngroves about 17 per cent of the trees are affected. That is the report\r\ncoming from the parties inspecting now for the Blight Commission. I\r\nshipped Mr. Mayo about four or five thousand trees this fall. I don't\r\nsuppose there were a dozen that were thrown out, thinking they were\r\nblighted or diseased. We have records of all that up at my place. There\r\nare some trees right here now that came from my nursery. I wish you\r\ngentlemen could just see for yourselves; come out and see.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: In advancing this chestnut on a commercial basis it had\r\nbetter be stated that it does not blight as badly as the American\r\nchestnut and that when blighted it can be cared for with less cost than\r\nthe apple tree. I would suggest that some such notice be sent out with\r\ncommercial stock. That would put it on the right basis so that the\r\nchestnut would find its position, which it is not finding now because\r\nthe people are full of the blight; and if a frank, full statement of\r\nthis sort were made I believe it would be extremely important.\r\n\r\nMr. Rockey: I went through practically the whole extent of Mr. Sober's\r\norchard recently and found one infected tree. I can vouch for the\r\nstatement that he has made that he is almost surrounded by blight.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: I have given attention to only a few of my own trees that\r\nwere blighted because I have too much else to do and too large a place,\r\na couple of hundred acres engaged in a small and large way,--a variety\r\nof ways--with nut trees; and the few I have cared to save after blight\r\nhas begun I have saved by cutting it out very thoroughly and using\r\neither white paint or grafting wax. I used also pine tar and some gas\r\ntar. I killed some good trees that I wanted particularly to save by\r\nputting on gas tar.\r\n\r\nThe matter of compelling the removal of infected trees is a very\r\nimportant one, but it must rest with the authorities. In the vicinity of\r\nNew York we have so much hard wood that you cannot sell it unless you\r\nare in some sort of a trade combination. Fine oak, fine hickory, fine\r\nchestnut, you can't dispose of in New York City, because we have such a\r\nlot of it. We have wild deer within fifteen miles of New York City on\r\nthree sides of us on account of the forests. You have got to find some\r\nspecial way for disposing of this blighted chestnut timber. Telephone\r\nand telegraph poles and ties all go for nothing, unless you happen to be\r\nso situated that you can manage the matter commercially, and a way\r\nshould be found by the state so that people can dispose of their\r\nblighted timber, which is just as good as any other.\r\n\r\nIt is very important to note that the boy scouts are interested, and we\r\nought to encourage their interest. It is a splendid thing, getting the\r\ninterest of boys engaged. You know how active a boy is in getting a\r\nsnake from under a rock and he will do the same thing with the chestnut\r\nblight. It is his natural tendency to hustle when he gets after\r\nanything. This chestnut blight belongs to the microbe group and the\r\nmicrobe is the great enemy of mankind. In wars the microbe kills about\r\neight men for every one killed by missiles. If we can encourage the\r\ninterest of boy scouts in fighting the greatest of all human enemies,\r\nthe microbe, including this little fungus, we shall have a splendid\r\nworking force.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the injection of poisons and medicines into trees, it seems\r\nto me that a very firm stand ought to be taken by all responsible men\r\nwho know anything about plant pathology. We know that a poison injected\r\ninto a tree must either act injuriously right there upon the cells of\r\nthe tree, or else must undergo metabolic changes. A tree cannot use\r\nanything that is thrown into it, poison or food or anything else, until\r\nit has undergone a metabolic change; you must have a distinct, definite\r\nchemical process taking place and we ought to state that most of the\r\nsubstances which are alleged to be of value, when injected into a tree,\r\nare either absolutely worthless or injurious. One man tried to persuade\r\nme that his medication if applied to the cambium layer would be\r\nabsorbed, and said that if I would only use it on a few of my trees I\r\ncould see for myself. He said it would drive off even the aphides. I\r\ntried it on four trees affected with aphides and found that he told me\r\nthe truth. It drove them off, because the trees died and the aphides\r\nleft. One tree lived a year before being killed; it was a most insidious\r\nsort of death, but the aphides left that tree. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nSome of the Asiatic chestnuts resist the blight very well. Curiously\r\nenough when grafted upon some of the American chestnuts they then become\r\nvulnerable. Two years ago, from a lot of about one thousand Corean\r\nchestnuts in which there had been up to that time no blight, I grafted\r\nscions on American stump sprouts and about 50 per cent of those grafts\r\nblighted in the next year, showing that the American chestnut sap offers\r\na pabulum attractive to the Diaporthe, and that is a fact of collateral\r\nvalue in getting our negative testimony upon the point.\r\n\r\nConcerning the question of carrying blight fifty miles, there's no\r\ntelling how far birds will fly carrying the spores of Diaporthe upon\r\ntheir feet. The spores are viscid and adhere to the feet of beetles, or\r\nmigratory birds which sometimes make long lateral flights following\r\nfood, rather than direct flights north and south. It is quite easy to\r\nimagine birds carrying this Diaporthe over an interval of possibly fifty\r\nmiles, making that distance in one night perhaps. Someone may have\r\ncarried chestnuts in his pocket to give to his granddaughter fifty miles\r\naway, and in that way carried the blight. If any grafted trees have been\r\ncarried fifty miles, or any railroad ties, with a little bark on,\r\ncarried fifty miles and then thrown off, it might blight the chestnuts\r\nin that vicinity. One can have as much range of imagination as he\r\npleases as Longfellow says, There is no limit to the imagination in\r\nconnection with questions of spreading the blight of Diaporthe.\r\n\r\nSome of the Japanese and Corean chestnuts and some of the Chinese\r\nchestnuts resist blight fairly well. Among my chinkapins, I have the\r\ncommon _pumila_ and the Missouri variety of _pumila_, which grows in\r\ntree form forty or fifty feet high. I have the alder-leaf chestnut,\r\nwhich keeps green leaves till Christmas, sometimes till March when the\r\nsnow buries them, and those comparatively young trees have shown no\r\nblight; but one hybrid, between the chinkapin and the American chestnut,\r\nabout twelve years of age, has blighted several times. I have cut off\r\nthe branches and kept it going, but this year I shall cut it down. It\r\nwill start at the root and sprout up again. I thought I'd give up that\r\nhybrid, but having heard Col. Sober's report I will begin at the root\r\nand look after some of the sprouts. That hybrid is the only one of my\r\nchinkapin group that has blighted at all.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the use of bichloride of mercury or formaldehyde, it seems\r\nto me that formaldehyde will be a better germicide than bichloride of\r\nmercury, because bichloride of mercury coagulates the albuminous part of\r\nthe plasm and may destroy the cell structure, whereas the formaldehyde\r\nwill be more penetrating and less injurious. One would need to know how\r\nstrong a formaldehyde solution can be used safely. I presume the most\r\nvulnerable part of the tree would be at the bud axils. Spraying must\r\nrequire considerable experience at the present time and is of doubtful\r\nefficiency for timber chestnuts I am sure. We would like very much to\r\nhear any further comment upon this subject.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: Mr. Sober's orchard is so unusually large that evidently it\r\ndoes not apply to average cases. The average man is buying chestnut\r\ntrees for the garden or yard or lane. Prof. Collins has an acre on the\r\ntop of a hill at Atlantic Forge and there he has fought diligently with\r\nthe skill of a highly trained man, and the blight is gradually driving\r\nhim back. I think that in a short time the trees on Prof. Collins' acre\r\nwill be gone. I believe we need much more information before we can\r\noffer any hope that chestnut trees from a nursery will be safe against\r\nblight. I should like to ask the Blight Commission if they are at the\r\npresent time planning to breed immune strains of chestnuts, and if not,\r\nI wish to suggest that it is a piece of work well worthy of their\r\nconsideration. They might try grafting on American stocks, or on their\r\nown seedlings, some of the Korean chestnuts, on any variety that\r\npromises resistance, and also hybridizing, with the hope of getting a\r\ngood nut that will resist the blight.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: That is a very important matter, no doubt. In regard to\r\nthe few chestnuts bought for lanes and gardens, I know a good many men\r\nwho have bought a few grafted chestnuts with the idea of setting out a\r\nnumber of acres if those few did well, being men of a conservative sort.\r\nMen of that sort are the ones we want to have in our Association. We\r\nwant to have men who will buy four trees, and if they do well, set out\r\nfour hundred acres. That is what a great many men have had in mind in\r\nbuying two, four or six trees of any one kind; they want to try them\r\nout. That is the wise way, the conservative way, the truly progressive\r\nway. If we are going to have very large numbers of any one kind of\r\nchestnut set out, we must make a statement of the dangers, so that men\r\nmay be forewarned. If they set them out without warning and are\r\ndisappointed, they drop the entire subject and go to raising corn and\r\nhogs; and then, to save trouble, turn these hogs into the corn and get\r\nto doing things in the easiest way, rather than carry on the complicated\r\nmethods of agriculture that belong to the spirit of the present time. I\r\nwould like to know if many efforts are being made toward breeding immune\r\nkinds. I am at work on that myself.\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce: Our Commission has recently gotten, I think, about fifty\r\npounds of Chinese chestnuts of several kinds, which they expect to plant\r\nfor experiment. Besides that they have made some other arrangements of\r\nwhich I know very little. This investigation will take years. The\r\nCommission has been compelled to devote itself to so many lines of work\r\nthat I am afraid this question has not been given the attention it might\r\nhave had. I think in the future there will be a good deal done along\r\nthat line.\r\n\r\nTwo of us have been given the title of tree surgeons, and we work, or\r\nmake arrangements to have someone else work, sometimes the scout, in the\r\norchards throughout the state. I have a list of two hundred owners of\r\ncultivated chestnut trees that I got in the last month from various\r\nsources. Anyone in Pennsylvania who has a cultivated chestnut tree, can\r\nsend a postal card, get one of us out to examine the tree and see\r\nwhether it is blighted, and we will demonstrate what can be done in the\r\nway of treating it. I have done that right along in the last two months.\r\nIf it is only a single tree I cut out all I can myself.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: There are two distinct questions; first, the chestnut as a\r\nfood tree, and second, as a timber tree. Your work has been chiefly with\r\nthe chestnut as a timber tree?\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce: No, mine has been mostly on the lawn, so that it is for\r\nnuts.\r\n\r\nExperiments made on one or two species of Japanese chestnuts show about\r\n9 per cent of tannin; the tannin in the American chestnut runs only 6\r\nper cent and in the small American, runs less. We know that the Japanese\r\nis somewhat more immune than the American. We have already found that it\r\nhas 50 per cent more tannin. I believe one of us wrote you about\r\nexperiments to find out the percentage of tannin in Corean, North\r\nJapanese, South Japanese and Chinese chestnuts. The investigation will\r\nbe carried on for the next two or three months.\r\n\r\nMr. Corsan: May I ask if there is any soil food that would increase the\r\namount of tannin? Trees protect themselves. We have watched the black\r\nwalnut and seen him fight all sorts of enemies. The tree has poisons\r\neverywhere and the nut a thick shell to boot and doesn't coax enemies to\r\nget at him or to eat him until he is ripe.\r\n\r\nA Member: Have you found that fertilizing a tree increased the\r\npercentage of tannin?\r\n\r\nMr. Rockey: That hasn't been determined yet but it will be studied.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: It is a question if the tendency would not be for tannin\r\nto go over to sugar and cellulose under cultivation. I don't remember\r\nthe chemistry on that. Aren't there any expert chemists here who can\r\ntell us? The natural tendency of the tree under high cultivation would\r\nbe to change tannin over into sugar and starch.\r\n\r\nMr. Corsan: This talk of the chestnut blight reminds me of a remark made\r\nby a gentleman at a peach growing convention. He said the best thing\r\nthat ever happened to this country was to get that San Jose scale\r\nbecause it stopped lazy men from growing peaches. He said, \"I don't mind\r\nit a bit and can make more money than when peaches were nothing a\r\nbasket.\" Probably nature will help us some way.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: We have to consider what nature wants to do.\r\n\r\nMr. Mayo: If I am in order, I would like to know whether this fungus\r\ntrouble is likely in the future to attack or has at any time attacked,\r\nthe apple, pear or quince?\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: I think it has been pretty well decided that they are not\r\nin danger. I will, however, ask Mr. Rockey and Mr. Pierce to answer that\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nMr. Rockey: Up to the present time there has been no indication that the\r\nblight will get into them. This might be a good occasion for me to\r\nmention the Connellsville fungus again. It was found on some of the oaks\r\nand other trees in this section of the country, and for a time it\r\nlooked as though the blight was getting into other species, but since\r\nthat fungus has been identified there has been no indication that the\r\nblight will extend beyond the chestnut group as a parasite, although you\r\ncan inoculate oaks and other trees with the fungus and it will live in\r\nthem, but only on the dead portion of the tree and not as the parasite\r\nlives on the chestnut.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: I should like to ask Mr. Sober if he has found any evidence\r\nthat the paragon chestnut differs from the native chestnut in resistance\r\nto the blight, and if his paragons are different from other paragons?\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: I cannot say whether my chestnuts are different from the\r\nother paragon chestnuts or not, or whether they are as resistant to the\r\nblight. I know it is a very sweet chestnut. In regard to keeping my\r\ngroves clean--from 1901 to 1910, we had three broods of locusts and two\r\nhailstorms that opened the bark in almost every tree and branch. The\r\nlimbs were stung by the locusts thousands of times, so that I didn't\r\nhave a crop of chestnuts. Professor Davis was cutting off limbs for a\r\ncouple of months so you see my trees were open, if any ever were, to\r\nreceive the blight. The hailstorms destroyed the leaves and I didn't\r\nhave any chestnuts that year in one part of my grove and with all\r\nthat--you people come and see how clean it is, that's all there is to\r\nit. I know what I've done and what I can do.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: The next paper in order is that of Professor Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUT GROWING AND TREE BREEDING AND THEIR RELATION TO CONSERVATION\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR J. RUSSELL SMITH, PENNSYLVANIA\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen; I am going to ask your\r\nindulgence for including in my subject a matter that perhaps goes a\r\nlittle beyond the scope of this organization, for I wish to speak of\r\nfruit as well as nut-bearing trees. Conservation, whose object is the\r\npreservation of our resources for future generations, as well as for\r\nourselves, finds its greatest problem in the preservation of the soil.\r\nThe forests can come again if the soil be left. It is probable that we\r\ncan find substitutes for coal, and for nearly everything else, but once\r\nthe soil is gone, all is gone; and the greatest danger to the soil is\r\nnot robbery by ill cropping, because no matter how man may abuse the\r\nsoil, scientific agriculture can bring it back with astonishing speed.\r\nBut the greatest enemy of conservation is erosion, the best checks for\r\nerosion are roots.\r\n\r\nThus far, the only man who has been telling us anything about planting\r\nroots upon the hillsides is the forester. But he usually sets nothing\r\nbut wood trees, which at the end of fifty or a hundred or a hundred and\r\nfifty years, we can cut down, and which, during the intervening time,\r\nhave done nothing but cast shade, drop leaves and retain the soil. My\r\ndoctrine is that the potentially greatest crop-producing plants are not\r\nthose on which we now depend for our food, but are the trees,; that the\r\ngreatest engines for production are not the grasses, but the trees. Our\r\nagriculture is an inheritance from the savage, and the savage found that\r\nhe could do better with annual grains than he could with nut trees,\r\nbecause he didn't know how to improve the nut crop by selection of the\r\ntrees, while there came involuntarily an improvement in the other crops.\r\nNo man today knows the parentage of some of the cultivated plants and\r\ngrains on which we now depend. Thus we came down to the present day of\r\nscience, with the purely chance discoveries of savages as the main\r\ndependence of mankind for the basis of agriculture.\r\n\r\nWe have within a decade discovered the laws of plant breeding. We know a\r\ngood deal more about it now than ever before and are in a position to\r\nstart about it very deliberately and with a reasonable certainty that we\r\nare going to get certain combinations of qualities if we keep at it long\r\nenough. Thus the hickory and walnut offer perfect marvels of\r\npossibilities. Look around on these tables and see the size of some of\r\nthese things. There are hickory nuts 1-1/4 inch long and there are\r\nshagbarks as full of meat as pecans and probably quite as good. There\r\nare in Kentucky, I am told, hickory nuts that you can take in your\r\nfingers and crush. Here we have the pecan, this great big shellbark from\r\nIndiana, the shagbark from the North, and the thin shell nuts from\r\nKentucky. Now hybridize these and I think, if you work at it long\r\nenough, you will get a tree that will have all those good qualities.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful black walnut is a tree of hardiness, and the delicious\r\nPersian or English walnut is a nut of acceptable form. The pair offers\r\nsplendid possibilities in their hybrid progeny.\r\n\r\nWe have fruits thus far recognized as of little value which offer great\r\npossibilities as forage producers. The mulberry bears from June to\r\nSeptember and the persimmon from September till March and the pig\r\nharvests them himself.\r\n\r\nWe have the possibility of a brand-new agriculture, depending not upon\r\ngrains, but upon tree crops, provided someone will breed the\r\ncrop-yielding trees which we can use. This will permit us to use\r\nentirely different kinds of land from that now considered best for\r\nagriculture. The natural necessities for plant growth, I believe, are\r\nheat, moisture, sunlight and fertility. Now they are not all the\r\nlimiting factors with man, because man adds the fifth, the arbitrary\r\nfact of arability, and that right away bars out about half of the\r\nfertile earth, because when we insist on heat, light, moisture,\r\nfertility _and arability_, we leave out that rough half of the earth\r\nequally fertile, idle, subject only to the work of the forester, who\r\nwill give us a forest about 1999. It might just as well be planted with\r\na host of crop-yielding trees, the walnuts, hickory nuts, pecans,\r\npersimmons, mulberries--and the list is very long. There are at the\r\npresent time in use in Mediterranean countries twenty-five crop-yielding\r\ntrees other than the ordinary orchard fruits. I am told that they have\r\noak trees there which yield an acorn that is better than the chestnut. A\r\npig will fill himself with acorns on the one hillside and with figs on\r\nthe next hillside and then lie down and get fat. We are too industrious,\r\nwe wait on the pig; I want the pig to wait on himself.\r\n\r\nBut who is going to breed these things? These crop yielding trees? A\r\ngentleman told us this morning that he was not nervous, that he could\r\nwatch a hickory tree grow, and stated that he had forty acres of land\r\nand was breeding trees for fun. Here is Dr. Morris, who is having a\r\ndelicious time doing the same thing. We should not have to depend on\r\nenthusiasts who are working for fun; we must not depend on such sources\r\nfor the greatest gifts in the line of food production that man can\r\nimagine. This work should be done by every state in the Union. I believe\r\nthat it is capable of proof that we can get just as much yield from a\r\nhillside in untilled fruit and nut-yielding trees, as we can from\r\nputting that same hillside under the plough and getting wheat, corn,\r\nbarley, rye and oats and a little grass once in a while. It will make\r\njust as much pig or just as many calories of man food from the tree\r\ncrops as it will make under the plough. And under the plough that\r\nhillside is going down the stream to choke it and reduce the hillside to\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nWe have three classes of land. The first class is the level land, which\r\nbelongs to the plough now and for all time. The third class, which is\r\nthe unploughable steep mountain and hill land, is probably as great in\r\narea as the level land, and between the two is the hilly land that we\r\nare now cultivating to its great detriment, visibly reducing the earth's\r\nresources by bringing about rapidly that condition which has led to the\r\nsaying in the Old World: \"After man, the desert.\" The Roman Empire,\r\nwhere men have had possession for two thousand years, proves, \"After\r\nman, the desert.\" It is equally proven in much of China, but it can be\r\nprevented if these hill lands are put to trees. But we cannot afford to\r\nput those lands into trees unless the trees yield.\r\n\r\nI move that this Association memorialize those persons who are in\r\nposition to promote the breeding of fruit and nut-yielding trees, that\r\nwe may bring nearer the day of tree-crop agriculture. I want a letter to\r\ngo from this Association with the authority of the Association and its\r\nsanction, to the Secretary of Agriculture at Washington and to all the\r\nmen in authority in the Bureau of Plant Industry at Washington, to the\r\nPresidents of the State Agricultural Colleges, the Directors of\r\nExperiment Stations and professors who are interested in plant breeding.\r\nThat will make a list of three or four hundred persons and involve an\r\nexpenditure of a few dollars but I believe it will be productive of\r\ngood. I hope that the Association will see fit to lend its name and a\r\nlittle cash to that proposition, because if we can get the authority of\r\nthe state and the money of the state, the results will come much more\r\nrapidly than if there are just a few of us doing it independently.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Will someone put Prof. Smith's suggestion in the form of a\r\nmotion?\r\n\r\nA Member: I move that it be referred to the Committee on Resolutions.\r\n\r\n(Motion carried.)\r\n\r\nMr. Corsan: Undoubtedly we all agree with Prof. Smith. He spoke of the\r\npersimmon. When I speak of the persimmon in my country nobody knows what\r\nI am talking about. I found two trees in Battle Creek, Michigan, in a\r\nfront yard. The person who owned them was an old lady. I said, \"Will you\r\ngive me these persimmons?\" She said, \"Yes, take them all; the neighbors\r\ncome here and while they are getting the persimmons they bother me a\r\nlot. Everybody seems to like them.\" They were delicious persimmons that\r\nwere quite edible before frost, they are probably the two furthest north\r\npersimmon trees in the world. I went a little way around Devil Lake, and\r\nfound pawpaws. They are a very good fruit when cultivated. The idea of\r\npreserving the soil and not sending it all into the Lakes and down into\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico--that is a good idea of Prof. Smith's.\r\n\r\nMr. Gardner: I submit that that Battle Creek woman should start a new\r\nbreakfast food. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nMr. Corsan: Every second year there is an immense crop on one of the\r\npersimmon trees; they are a male and female, I think. You can't see the\r\nbranches for the fruit, and the thermometer there falls to 22 degrees\r\nbelow zero.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: You can graft the male trees with pistillate grafts if you\r\nwant to, or you can transfer grafts both ways. The persimmon and pawpaw\r\nwill undoubtedly both grow at Toronto. They are not indigenous there\r\nbecause of natural checks to development in their sprouting stage, but\r\nif you buy Indiana stock for Toronto, such transplanted trees will both\r\ngrow there, I am sure. This is not quite relevant to Prof. Smith's\r\npaper. It seems to me that Prof. Smith gave us a very comprehensive\r\nresumé of facts bearing upon the situation, perhaps not particularly\r\ncalling for discussion. We are very glad to have his arraignment of\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nThe next paper on the program will be that of Dr. Deming. While Dr.\r\nDeming is getting ready, I would like to have the trees shown. Mr. Jones\r\nwill speak about his pecans, these specimens of young trees here.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: These are pecans that Mr. Roper brought up from the\r\nArrowfield Nurseries. (Here Mr. Jones described the trees.)\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Would those trees grow after they have been dried as much\r\nas that?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: I don't think so; pecans don't stand much drying.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: No, unless you cut off all the roots.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: If we should dig up a tree like this and cut it off a foot\r\nand a half down, would it be all right to transplant it?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: Yes, if your season should not be too dry.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: What has been your experience with the Stringfellow method\r\nof cutting off every single root?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: We cut the tap-roots off, but leave an inch of the lateral\r\nroots.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: I think you can do better by following the Stringfellow\r\nmethod and cutting off all the laterals.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: If you were going to transplant those for your own use\r\nwhere would you cut them off?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: About here, a foot and a half down.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: And the top?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: Yes, sir, I'd reduce the top about that much; I think we will\r\nhave to work for a better root for the North.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEGINNING WITH NUTS\r\n\r\nDR. W. C. DEMING, WESTCHESTER, NEW YORK CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his official capacity as secretary of the Northern Nut Growers\r\nAssociation the writer is frequently asked, by persons wishing to grow\r\nnuts, about climate, soils, varieties and methods.\r\n\r\nThe following observations are intended to apply only to the\r\nnortheastern United States, the country lying east of the Rockies and\r\nnorth of the range of the southern pecan. They are intended more for the\r\nperson who already has his land, or is restricted in his range, than for\r\nthe one who can range wide for larger operations and will study deeper\r\nbefore deciding.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that most nuts will grow wherever the peach will. Outside\r\nthe peach area there is probably not much use in trying to grow the\r\npecan or Persian walnut. Yet it must always be remembered that nut\r\ngrowing in the North is, at present, almost entirely experimental and\r\nthat anybody may be able to disprove the authorities. We are all\r\nexperimenting now. By and by it will be different.\r\n\r\nIn severer climates the chestnut, shagbark, black walnut, butternut,\r\nhazel, beech, pine, Japanese cordiformis and hardy Chinese walnuts can\r\nbe grown or, at least, offer possibilities. In such climates the\r\ndevelopment of the native nuts by selection and crossing, and the\r\nadaptation of alien nuts, deserves, and will repay, experiment.\r\n\r\nIt is to be supposed, as before said, that the hopeful beginner already\r\nhas his land. Let him choose the best part of it that he can spare. By\r\n\"best part\" is meant the most fertile, not too wet nor too dry nor, if\r\npossible, too hilly to cultivate. Hard pan near the surface, and too\r\nthick to be easily broken up by dynamite, is not desirable.\r\n\r\nA nut orchard ought to have much the same preparation as an apple\r\norchard. A practical way would be to plow deeply and harrow well in\r\nsummer and sow a cover crop like rye and vetch or clover. The more\r\nstable manure, or other fertilizer, applied the better.\r\n\r\nLet the field now be staked off thirty feet apart in squares, or in\r\ntriangles if preferred. Late in the fall dig the holes and plant nuts,\r\nthree or four in each hole, two to four inches deep, according to size,\r\nand six inches apart. Put a good handful of ground bone in each hill.\r\nUnless the soil and subsoil are mellow, so that the long tap roots may\r\npenetrate deeply, it would be best to dynamite the holes, using a half\r\npound of 20 per cent or 25 per cent dynamite at a depth of two and a\r\nhalf feet. This is a simple matter and the dynamite companies will\r\nfurnish materials and instructions. It is also some fun.\r\n\r\nThere is some danger that nuts planted in fall may be destroyed by\r\nrodents, that some will \"lie over\" and not sprout the first year, or\r\nthat all the nuts in a hill may make inferior plants, so that some\r\nauthorities advise putting them in a galvanized wire cage, the nuts only\r\nhalf buried, then covered with a few leaves during the winter and\r\notherwise left exposed to the elements. In the spring they must be taken\r\nfrom the cage and planted in the hills before the sprouts are long\r\nenough to be easily broken.\r\n\r\nThe different kinds of nuts should be planted in \"blocks\" rather than\r\nmingled, to facilitate handling.\r\n\r\nThese nuts are to furnish trees that are later to be grafted or budded.\r\nAfter they have grown a while the weaker ones are to be removed, as\r\nnecessary, until only the strongest remains in each hill. When grafted\r\nand grown to great size the brave man will thin them out to sixty feet\r\napart. Interplanting with fruits or vegetables may be practised.\r\n\r\nAs to the kinds of nuts to be planted that depends on what you want to\r\ngrow. If chestnuts it must be remembered that the bark disease is very\r\nlikely to attack them, in the East at any rate. Experiments with\r\nchestnuts outside the range of the blight are very desirable. The\r\nAmerican (_Castanea dentata_) and European (_C. sativa_) chestnuts are\r\nspecially susceptible. The Asiatic chestnuts (_C. Japonica_, etc.) seem\r\nto have a partial immunity, especially the Korean, and it is possible\r\nthat the native chestnut grafted on these may be rendered more or less\r\nimmune. It is being tried and is an interesting experiment.\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic chestnut trees are dwarfish in habit, come into bearing\r\nearly, the nuts are generally large and some of them of pretty good\r\nquality. They may be planted as fillers between the trees of larger\r\ngrowth. The nuts may be bought of importers. (See circular on \"Seedsmen\r\nand Nurserymen\".) The small Korean chestnut has been especially\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to grow the shagbark hickory (_Hicoria ovata_) plant the\r\nbest specimens of this nut you can get, or the bitternut (_H. minima_)\r\nwhich is said to be a superior stock for grafting.\r\n\r\nHigh hopes are held that that other favorite hickory, the pecan (_H.\r\npecan_) may be grown far outside its native range, and the Indiana pecan\r\nis the nut on which these hopes are founded. Seed nuts may be obtained\r\nfrom reliable Indiana dealers, but it is said that some of them are not\r\nreliable.\r\n\r\nThe hickories may be budded and grafted on one another so that one kind\r\nof stock may serve for both shagbark and pecan.\r\n\r\nIf you want to grow the Persian walnut (_Juglans regia_), often called\r\nthe \"English\" walnut, the black walnut (_J. nigra_), seems to afford the\r\nmost promising stock, though _J. rupestris_, native in Texas and\r\nArizona, has been recommended and _J. cordiformis_, the Japanese heart\r\nnut, is also promising. This nut can be recommended for planting for its\r\nown sake as the tree is hardy, a rapid grower, comes into bearing early\r\nand bears a fairly good nut. There are no grafted trees, however, so the\r\nvariable seedlings will have to be depended upon.\r\n\r\nOn any of these walnut stocks the black walnut and the butternut (_J.\r\ncinerea_) may also be propagated if worthy varieties can be found. There\r\nare none now on the market.\r\n\r\nThe nuts mentioned are enough for the beginner and the three stocks,\r\nchestnut, hickory and walnut, will give him all he wants to work on and\r\nfurnish plenty of fascinating occupation.\r\n\r\nThe hazel, the almond and others, though offering possibilities, had\r\nbetter be left to those further advanced in the art of nut growing.\r\n\r\nNow the nut orchard is started and the owner must push the growth of the\r\ntrees by the ordinary methods, cultivation, cover crops and fertilizers.\r\nSee any authority on growing fruit trees.\r\n\r\nIn from two to five years the trees will be ready for budding and\r\ngrafting, they will have made a good growth above ground, and a bigger\r\none below, they are permanently placed and haven't got to be set back a\r\nyear or two, or perhaps killed, by transplanting, with loss to the tap\r\nroots and laterals. In the writer's opinion that natural tap root of the\r\nnut tree growing down, down to water is not to be treated as of no\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nSo let your seedlings grow up and down happily while you get ready the\r\nstuff with which to build their future character, for seedling trees are\r\nvery slow in coming into bearing, and uncertain in type and quality of\r\nnut. Grafted trees bear early and true to type.\r\n\r\nTake your choicest bit of ground and put it in the best shape you know\r\nhow. Then order the finest grafted trees you can find on the market.\r\n(See circular on \"Seedsmen and Nurserymen\".) Your choice will be limited\r\nfor there are as yet only a few grafted varieties of the Persian walnut\r\nand the Indiana pecan, and but one of the shagbark hickory to be had. Of\r\nchestnuts there are more and, in the South of course, plenty of pecans.\r\nBut pecan growing in the South is another story. If you order chestnuts\r\nbe sure that they do not come from a nursery infected with blight. Get\r\nyoung trees because they are more easily established.\r\n\r\nOrder from two to four of each variety. Fewer than two gives too small\r\nan allowance for mortality and more than four, besides the not\r\ninconsiderable strain on the pocket, will divide your attention too\r\nmuch; for you have got to give these trees the care of a bottle baby.\r\n\r\nSet them sixty feet apart if you have the room. If not set them closer.\r\nBetter closer if that means better care. They may be set in the fall but\r\nprobably spring is better, as early as you can get them in. Follow the\r\ninstructions of the nurserymen closely. Digging holes with dynamite is\r\nprobably good practice. Put some bone meal in the soil around the roots\r\nbut no strong fertilizer. Some soils need lime. Tamp the soil about the\r\nroots with all your might. It cannot be made too firm.\r\n\r\nThen water them all summer, or until August if they have made a good\r\ngrowth. Give them all they can drink once a week. Sink a large bar about\r\na foot from the tree and pour the water into the hole, as much as the\r\nsoil will take.\r\n\r\nKeep up cultivation and a dust mulch or, if you cannot do this, mulch\r\nwith something else. Mulching doesn't mean a wisp of hay but something\r\nthick or impervious. Six inches of strawy manure, grass, vines or weeds;\r\nan old carpet, burlap, feed or fertilizer bags or even newspapers, held\r\ndown with stones or weeds or earth, all make good mulches.\r\n\r\nThese trees ought to grow and, whether you ever succeed in grafting your\r\nseedlings or not, you should have at least a small orchard of fine nut\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe second summer with the trees will be something like the baby's.\r\nWorms may bother them. Look out for bud worms and leaf-eating\r\ncaterpillars. Give them all the water they can drink in the dry dog\r\ndays. Nurse them, feed them and watch them and they will grow up to\r\nbless you. Some of them may bear as early as apple trees.\r\n\r\nThese trees, and such scions as, from time to time, you may obtain\r\nelsewhere, are to furnish your propagating material.\r\n\r\nThe plan just described may be modified in various ways, but the general\r\nprinciples are the same. Instead of planting the nuts in their permanent\r\npositions they may be put in nursery rows where they may have the\r\nadvantage of intensive cultivation. The best of the resulting trees may\r\nbe grafted or budded in the rows, or after they have been transplanted\r\nand have become well established. This method is an excellent one and\r\nhas distinct advantages and many advocates.\r\n\r\nYearling seedlings may be bought and set either in permanent positions\r\nor in nursery rows.\r\n\r\nOf course the man who is in a hurry, who can disregard expense and who\r\ndoes not care for the experience and gratification of grafting his own\r\ntrees, may set his whole plantation with expensive grafted trees and\r\nreplant where they fail.\r\n\r\nThe technique of budding and grafting you must work out yourself with\r\nthe help of the instructions obtainable from several authorities, or, by\r\nfar the surer way, study the art with a master. The essentials are good\r\nstocks and good scions, the right moment--and practice.\r\n\r\nExcellent publications giving instructions in methods of propagation\r\nare: \"The Persian Walnut Industry in the United States,\" by E.

Join the nut growers associations, subscribe to the nut\r\njournals, get all the literature (see Circular No. 3) and you will soon\r\nbe happily out of the fledgeling stage of nut growing and begin to do as\r\nyou please.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Comment upon this paper is now in order.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: You say you are going to issue that?\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: On my own responsibility, but subject to modification.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: If that is going out as a circular of the association, I would\r\nlike to suggest two slight changes. For instance, you wouldn't expect\r\nthe ordinary nut tree to begin to bear as early as the ordinary\r\ntransplanted apple tree.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Some would.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: A summer apple would begin to bear much earlier than the\r\nordinary nut tree.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: Well, chestnuts begin to bear very early after grafting.\r\nI refer only to grafted trees here.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: I thought that the paper had to do with trees that were\r\nplanted as nuts.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: No, I think I made that perfectly clear.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: What is that new statement about roots, that it is desirable\r\nto leave them?\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: That it is better that a tree should go undisturbed than\r\nthat it should be transplanted.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: Isn't there a question about that?\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: A question would arise in the hands of an expert,\r\nperhaps, but I think for an amateur, that a tree growing where the nut\r\nwas planted is more likely to live and do well than a transplanted tree.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: I am not so certain about that, but what I had in mind was\r\nthat the planter would get the idea that the tap-root was not to be cut\r\noff and that it is very desirable to the tree.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: That's a good point.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: About cutting the tap-root I have said yes and no so fast\r\nthat I don't know which I've said last, and it seems to me that we ought\r\nto have discussion on this very point.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: I have said that in buying these grafted trees you should\r\nset them out following the instructions of the nurseryman closely.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: But that statement about the tap-root would lead the average\r\nplanter to think that it was very desirable to have the tap-root.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: Has it been settled that it is not desirable?\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: Well, I think it has been generally accepted that it is of no\r\nspecial value.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: That trees will grow as well transplanted as if they have\r\nnever been transplanted?\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: Well, I shouldn't want to put it that way, but this is the\r\npoint: I would like to have the tree planter understand that a walnut\r\ntree doesn't need the tap-root and if he cuts off the tap-root in\r\nplanting, there is no great loss. I wouldn't want to say that his trees\r\nwouldn't begin to bear earlier or bear larger if left in the original\r\nplace. I prefer to transplant my own tree after it is grown, rather than\r\nrun the risk of getting scrub trees in the post hole or on the hill. I\r\nprefer to select the grafted trees even without the tap-roots, which\r\nwould be removed in digging, and planting them all uniform, rather than\r\nto plant the seeds. Speaking for the amateur, I think the latter is good\r\npractice. The point I had in mind was that many people will not take the\r\ntime to plant nuts but will want to set grafted trees, and the question\r\nis, should they have considerable tap-root--the grafted trees?\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: Following my plan, a man would buy a small number of fine\r\ntrees and set them out at once; that would probably be all he would\r\nundertake and all he could probably manage. He would also plant a small\r\nnumber of nuts on which to experiment in propagation. My experience up\r\nin Connecticut has been that all my southern transplanted trees, almost\r\nwithout exception, have died. I have planted pecans and Persian walnuts\r\nfrom a number of different nurseries. I have done it personally and done\r\nit as carefully as I could, but they have either made a very feeble\r\ngrowth indeed or have all died. On the other hand, the seeds I have\r\nplanted have grown into very vigorous trees.\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: I have had a little experience with the tap-root theory. You\r\ncan't dig a walnut tree without cutting the tap-root, and that tap-root,\r\nI find, is practically of no benefit at all after you have your upper\r\nlaterals, and an abundance of them; by cutting the tap-root growth is\r\nstimulated and a new tap-root is made. It is very largely in the mode of\r\npruning the tap-root. You can readily stimulate the tap-root system.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: You try to keep an equilibrium by cutting down the top in\r\nproportion?\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. Pomeroy: In examining transplanted trees I found ten times as many\r\nroots where the tap-root had been cut; and there were two tap-roots. I\r\nlike a tree with a good tap-root system and I am positive that if you\r\ntransplant a tree you get a better root system, get a great many more\r\nroots.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: The tree development, it seems to me, depends not upon the\r\nnumber of roots which are carried with it when it is transplanted, but\r\nupon the feeding roots which develop. Now, if we cut back the tap-root,\r\ncut back the laterals, cut back the top, we have a tree carrying in its\r\ncambium layer, food, just as a turnip or beet would carry it--and I look\r\nupon a transplanted tree much as a carrot or beet, with stored food\r\nready to make a new root.\r\n\r\nMr. Harris: I planted last fall a year ago a lot of English walnuts.\r\nWould the gentleman advise taking those up, cutting the tap-roots and\r\nplanting them again?\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: I don't think that would be advisable.\r\n\r\nMr. Harris: They were grown from the nuts sown in a row last fall a year\r\nago and grew very well.\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: In propagating the English walnut we have had them do the best\r\nby transplanting when the tree is about two years old, but it will more\r\nor less disturb the vigor of a tree to transplant it. That is\r\nself-evident; it needs some time to heal those wounds that are made both\r\nin the root and the branch.\r\n\r\nMr. Harris: What time of year do you bud them?\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: In August.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutt: I notice some trees here that are evidently two-year old\r\npecans that have been cut back, and you notice that in every case\r\nseveral tap-roots have taken the place of the one. Here are some others\r\nthat have not been cut. These have gone straight down. They are strong\r\nroots with few fibers on them. On these other trees that have been cut\r\nthe formation of tap-roots continues. They will go down till they strike\r\na permanent water-table and then the tap-root will stop. In Hyde County,\r\nNorth Carolina, near the ocean, the water-table is close to the surface\r\nand there is a deep black alluvial soil with a great deal of water in\r\nit. In order to grow anything there they have to put in ditches to get\r\nthe water out. The pecan trees growing there have absolutely no\r\ntap-roots at all, it rots off as soon as it strikes the permanent\r\nwater-table; and I think that's the reason they produce such enormous\r\nquantities of pecans in that county. In bottomless, sandy land where\r\nthere is no clay the root keeps on going down till it finds the\r\npermanent water-table, even if that is six or eight or ten feet down.\r\nThese roots, as you see, were going right down to China to look at that\r\nking on the other side if they got a chance. It's the same with the long\r\nleaf pine. It has a tap-root below ground thicker than the trunk above\r\nground. The reason is that it grows naturally on those bottomless\r\nplaces; the root goes down till it strikes water, then runs off\r\nlaterally. If you cut the roots they are bound to make new tap-roots.\r\nYou can see the place where they have been cut and in place of one\r\ntap-root you have two, going right down into that sandy soil till they\r\nfind a water-table. I believe that a nurseryman who will cut off the\r\nroot of the pecan tree when it is transplanted, will cause it to form\r\nmore lateral roots and make a better tree. There's a great number of\r\nvigorous roots in this tree than in this, and this tree whose root has\r\nbeen cut off will make a tree much easier to transplant and will be a\r\nbetter tree than those with great thick roots without the fibers that\r\nhave the root hairs upon them.\r\n\r\nA member: You wouldn't recommend cutting back that tap-root too\r\nseverely, would you?\r\n\r\nMr. Hutt: In planting a tree of this kind, I'd cut off a foot or 18\r\ninches. If you get about 24 inches in a specially good soil, or about 30\r\ninches of root ordinarily that's all you want.\r\n\r\nA member: I should think that would depend quite a little on the height\r\nof the water-table. If you were planting on land where the water-table\r\nis low, you would leave more tap-root?\r\n\r\nMr. Hutt: Yes.\r\n\r\nA member: That was the reason I brought up the point, because I think\r\ncutting so short would be too severe.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutt: The cambium is the only part of the tree that maintains\r\ngrowth. Every wound kills the cambium to a certain extent, so I always\r\ncut off roots of any size with sharp shears as smoothly as possible. I\r\ncut far enough back to find good, fresh, living tissue. In moist soil\r\nthat will callous over. In the South the soil is moist and we have\r\ngrowing conditions in the winter time, so it will callous over during\r\nthe winter. In the North, I understand, you make a practice of planting\r\nin the spring, because of the weather conditions.\r\n\r\nMr. Harris: In Western Maryland we have in the mountains a deep, sandy\r\nsoil; there doesn't appear to be any water bottom to it; what would the\r\ntap-root do in that case?\r\n\r\nMr. Hutt: It will go down until it finds what it wants, finds sufficient\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nMr. Harris: Gravelly bottom?\r\n\r\nMr. Hutt: If you have ever seen the roots of a long leaf pine, you've\r\nseen where the roots go to when they get a chance.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: I should like to ask Dr. Deming if he would give us his\r\nexperience in propagating the walnut and hickory?\r\n\r\nDr. Deming: A very important thing indeed for us nut growers in the\r\nNorth is to learn how to propagate. Dr. Morris has had some success; I\r\nhaven't had any. I have tried it summer and spring, year after year. I\r\nbelieve there are a few pieces of bark, without buds, still growing.\r\nChestnuts I haven't found very difficult, but with the walnut and\r\nhickory I have had no success whatever, although I have practiced the\r\nbest technique I could master. I think one reason why I have had no\r\nsuccess is that I haven't had good material. I have had good stocks, but\r\nI haven't had good scions, not the sort of scion that the successful\r\nsouthern nurserymen use. Still, Dr. Morris has had success with the same\r\nkind of material that I have failed with.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Not very much success.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: Dr. Deming said that the land ought not to be too dry nor too\r\nwet. Would you feel like saying that a water-table at 24 inches was\r\nneither too low nor too high?\r\n\r\nMr. Hutt: It depends a great deal on the nature of the soil, the\r\nwater-pulling capacity of the soil. Take a soil like that I mentioned,\r\nin Hyde County, near the ocean; you can see it quake all around you.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: But would you say that the northern nut grower might safely\r\nput his orchard on soil that had a water-table within two or three feet\r\nof the surface?\r\n\r\nMr. Hutt: I could tell if I saw that soil. If it is craw-fishy, or soil\r\nthat is ill-drained or won't carry ordinary crops, I'd say keep off of\r\nit, but if it will bear ordinary crops it's all right; in some cases\r\nwhere the soil is very rich the plant does not need to go down into that\r\nsoil anything like the depth it would in a poor soil. The poorer the\r\nsoil the further the roots have to go to find nourishment.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: I think that is an extremely exceptional case in relation to\r\nnorthern nuts. There is very little such North Carolina land in this\r\nsection of the country, if I judge right. We don't plant nut-growing\r\norchards up here in peaty soils, so Dr. Deming's recommendation was\r\nrather for very good agricultural soil. A water-table here must be eight\r\nor ten feet deep; in that event, it would not make any difference\r\nwhether you left three feet of tap-root or 15 inches.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutt: No.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: In the soils of some parts of New England, a tree would\r\nhave to have a root three or four hundred feet deep to get to flowing\r\nwater, but nevertheless trees flourish there.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: But the capillarity of the soil provides water for the tree\r\nabove the water-table.\r\n\r\nMr. Corsan: It all depends on the kind of nut. At St. Geneva I came\r\nacross a butternut that was growing in a soil that would kill a chestnut\r\nvery quickly. The soil was very springy and wet and the butternut just\r\nloves that soil. I found that while other butternut trees bore nuts in\r\nclusters of one to three, this butternut tree was bearing them in\r\nclusters of ten and eleven. At Lake George, right in front of the\r\nPost-Office, there was one tree twenty-four years old, two feet through,\r\nthat grew butternuts in clusters of ten and you could get a barrel of\r\nnuts from it. It bore again this last summer heavily, not in clusters of\r\nten but in clusters of seven or eight. When we have damp soil we can't\r\ngrow the chestnut but the hickory nut will grow in a swamp, and so will\r\nthe butternut.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: And the beech.\r\n\r\nMr. Corsan: The beech wants clay; it won't grow unless there is clay.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Our beech will grow where it has to swim.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: Before we get away from this discussion I think that we ought\r\nto commend Dr. Deming in the selection of this subject and in the\r\nhandling of his paper. In my position in the Government, we have a good\r\nmany inquiries about nut matters, and they are usually from people who\r\nwant to know how to start. The great call for information at the present\r\ntime is from the beginners, not from the advanced people, and I am glad\r\nthat Dr. Deming took that subject and handled it as he did, and I am\r\nglad that he proposes to issue it as a circular from this Association.\r\nIt will be a great relief to others who are called on for information.\r\n\r\nI should like to have a word, too, about this tap-root question. From\r\nwhat has been said it is pretty clear that there is quite a difference\r\nof opinion. We sometimes think we can improve on nature in her ways by\r\nharsh methods and, while I know it is customary in the nurseries of the\r\nSouth to cut the tap-roots back pretty severely, I wonder, sometimes,\r\nwhether that is always the best thing.\r\n\r\nI haven't had any personal experience, but I have observed quite a good\r\ndeal, and the tendency, it seems to me, is to try to develop as much as\r\npossible the fibrous root. Sometimes that is brought about by cutting\r\nthe tap-root, or putting a wire mesh below where the seed is planted, so\r\nas to form an obstruction to the tap-root, so that it necessarily forms\r\na fibrous root. Where the tap-root is the only root I doubt very much\r\nthe advisability of cutting back too severely.\r\n\r\nCol. Van Duzee: I have heard this subject discussed all over this\r\ncountry, in meetings of this kind, and a great deal of energy has been\r\nwasted. I do not think any of us know anything about it, but I do wish\r\nto say this, that when you come to transplant a tree from the nursery to\r\nthe orchard, there are things of infinitely more moment than how you\r\nshall hold your knife between your fingers when you cut the roots. The\r\nexposure of the roots to the air, the depth to which the tree is to be\r\nput in the ground, the manner in which it shall be handled--those things\r\nare of infinitely more importance, because we know we can transplant\r\ntrees successfully and get good results when the tap-root has been\r\ninjured or almost entirely removed. I do not consider that the question\r\nof cutting the tap-root is of very serious importance, but I do think we\r\nshould insert a word of caution as to the exposure of the roots of trees\r\nto the atmosphere, and make it just as strong as we are capable of\r\nwriting it.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: That is a very interesting point, that we have fixed our\r\neye on the tap-root and talked too much about it. Not long ago one of\r\nthe agricultural journals decided finally to settle the question about\r\nthe time for pruning grapes, whether it should be done in the fall,\r\nspring, winter or summer, and after summing up all the testimony from\r\nenthusiastic advocates for each one of the seasons, the editor decided\r\nthat the best time is when your knife is sharp; and that is very much\r\nthe way with the tap-root. Be very particular in getting the root in and\r\ncaring for it.\r\n\r\nMr. Pomeroy: Prof. Close, in a bulletin issued two years ago, spoke as\r\ndoes Col. VanDuzee about protecting the roots of the trees; he said\r\n\"when the trees are taken from the box that you receive them in, don't\r\nexpose them to the sun or air, puddle every tree, and plant as soon as\r\npossible.\" I think that is pretty good advice. It doesn't cost any\r\nmoney, and takes very few minutes, to puddle the trees and it saves many\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: I have tried the Stringfellow Method of cutting back top\r\nand root until my men asked me if I didn't want to transplant another\r\ntree instead, and they have grown just as well as trees on which I took\r\ngreat pains to preserve fine branching roots.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: The last thing in my thought was to start a discussion of\r\nthis perennial subject of the tap-root, but I should like criticism of\r\nthis little circular, no matter how severe, because I am not finally\r\ncommitted to it and want to make it as useful as possible.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: Every man likes to ride his own hobby horse. Would it not\r\nbe wise to suggest that some of these seedlings be put in odd corners?\r\nCertainly the hickory and walnut are adept in making themselves a home\r\nin the roughest kind of land.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: I have tried that, but I don't think, as a rule, the\r\ntrees do well when stuck around in fence corners and odd places. To be\r\nsure the trees I put behind the barn or pig pen have grown beautifully,\r\nso that at one time I thought of building barns and pig pens all over\r\nthe farm to put trees behind, but where they were set in fence corners\r\nand out of the way places they have not done very well. I think the\r\nexperience of others is about to the same effect.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: My experience has been different from yours. I have some\r\nchestnut and walnut trees, on an unploughable hillside in the corner of\r\nmy father's farm in Virginia which I stuck there ten or a dozen years\r\nago and have done very little to them. Of course they are native. They\r\nhave thriven. Nature does it exactly that way.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: It seems to me there is no question that they will do\r\nbetter under cultivation. Of course they may do fairly well in odd\r\nplaces if they can dominate the other growth.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: A man could take a pocketful of the various kinds of nuts\r\nand go around his fence corners and plant a few. In an hour he can plant\r\nfifty, and if he gets one to grow it is good return for that hour's\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: I have advised people to take a handful of nuts and a\r\ncane when they go out walking and occasionally stick one in.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: In our locality, people would ask, \"Why is that string of\r\nsquirrels following that man?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Corsan: I have been planting nuts in that way for years.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: If a man planted trees which belonged in his neighborhood,\r\nnuts that were already in the dominant ruling group, then his chances\r\nfor success would be very good, but if he introduced in fence corners\r\ntrees that had to adjust themselves to a new environment, he would find\r\nvery few growing and the squirrels, other trees and various obstacles to\r\ndevelopment in the midst of established species, would wipe out most of\r\nthem. Nevertheless, as it isn't much trouble, I would advise anybody to\r\ntake a pocketful of hickory nuts out with him when he goes for a walk\r\nand plant one every little way.\r\n\r\nA Member: The idea is good; let us follow it up.\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: I don't think it is feasible at all to plant trees around\r\nfence corners.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: In our locality it would not do at all.\r\n\r\nA Member: It won't do in any locality. The sods and grass around the\r\ntree will dwarf it and cause a very slow growth. Our time is valuable\r\nand we can't wait on that kind of a tree to bring results. Cultivation\r\nis the main need. Sometimes trees will do well where the soil is rich\r\nand competition absent. In Burlington, N. J. we found a walnut tree\r\nbearing enormous crops in a back yard. I have seen the same thing in\r\nthis county, and also in Carlisle, and the Nebo tree, famous for its\r\nwonderful productiveness, has a similar environment. But it is high\r\ncultivation that usually is necessary for the best results in all trees,\r\nand walnut trees particularly.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: Here is a note relating to this subject:\r\n\r\n\"The women of Sapulpa, Okla., who recently organized for city and county\r\nimprovement and advancement, have determined to plant pecan, walnut and\r\nhickory trees on both sides of a road now being constructed through\r\nCreek County, basing their action on the theory that two pecan trees\r\nplaced in the back yard of a homestead will pay the taxes on the\r\nproperty. They believe that when the trees begin to bear they will\r\nprovide a fund large enough for the maintenance of the road.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: That's all right if you can look after them.\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: It is very interesting to listen to these discussions of\r\nroadside trees and I have until recently been a strong advocate of them,\r\nbut I have changed my opinion. I don't think there is anything in the\r\nplanting of trees in fence corners or along the roadside, for several\r\nreasons. The first reason is that nobody knows how long it is going to\r\ntake that tree to amount to anything. I wouldn't give two cents a piece\r\nfor trees stuck out where you cannot cultivate them and get to them to\r\nfertilize them. Another thing, we are right up against the problem of\r\nthe insect pests of these trees and who is going to take care of them\r\nalong the roadside? The insect pests will get on them and come into the\r\nfields of the man who is cultivating and raising trees legitimately.\r\nDown in southern Indiana, now, we find along the roadside hundreds of\r\nwalnut trees that are every year eaten up with caterpillars. They love\r\nthose trees and come over on to my trees. I keep my trees cleaned off\r\npretty well. There's that problem. Up to a short time ago I was an\r\nadvocate of roadside trees. It would be all right if there was some\r\nmeans of cultivating them. If there is land somewhere that is of no use,\r\nso that it doesn't make a bit of difference whether the trees on it have\r\ninsect pests or not, you can go out there and scatter nuts and let it\r\nalone and wait the length of time you've got to wait. I don't think it's\r\nof much value, however, even then. I don't think there is a thing in it.\r\nI used to pride myself on the fact that I had set out more trees than\r\nanybody else in the State of Indiana. I haven't bragged about that for a\r\nlong time, though I have set out, perhaps, in the last eight or ten\r\nyears, or had set out under my direction, about 750,000 trees; I am not\r\nparticularly proud of that any more, but I am proud to meet the fellow\r\nwho has set out twenty or thirty acres of trees on good land, the best\r\nhe's got, and cultivated them and kept the insects off of them and\r\nburned them up instead of letting them prey on the neighborhood. I think\r\nthere should be a law passed that these trees along the roadside must be\r\ncut down or that somebody will have to take care of them.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: The original idea of roadside trees was constructive in\r\nits nature but failed to include the idea that, with the increase of\r\norchard trees, or trees of any one species, we increase the insect pests\r\nbecause we disturb the balance of nature; and by disturbing the balance\r\nof nature we give advantage to insects which then remain on neglected\r\ntrees to prove a menace to our own orchards. It we have various towns\r\nsetting out roadside trees and detailing the children to look after\r\nthem, asking the children to report on them, I believe the thing can be\r\nmade a success and that the taxes of many a small town can be paid from\r\nthe nut trees along the roadside, provided you have one boy or one girl\r\nfor each tree, their services to be given free and the profit from the\r\ntree to be given to the town.\r\n\r\nMr. Corsan: How about the cattle? Let them keep grazing around?\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Oh, my, yes.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: I think we sometimes let our feelings make us say things\r\nthat our brains would scarcely approve. I believe Mr. Littlepage's\r\ncharge against the tree on the roadside is not necessarily\r\nsubstantiated. I don't know just how he is going to take care of his\r\ntrees, but if it requires a vehicle carrying spray, I submit that a\r\nroadside tree is about as well fixed as one in his field. If it requires\r\na man with a stick or a hoe or a ladder, the tree on the roadside is in\r\nabout as eligible a location as one in the field. If care implies the\r\nidea of turning over the soil, the roadside is handicapped, but nature\r\nhas got along without having the soil upturned. My point is this; there\r\nis on nearly every farm in the East a little patch of land somewhere, a\r\nlittle row between a road and stream where a few trees can grow, and if\r\nfertilization is required, a few barrels of manure can go there as well\r\nas anywhere else. The fact that a tree is put in a place that is not\r\nploughed doesn't mean that it is beyond all care. My point is that with\r\ncare we can get trees in fence rows without tillage and that, in\r\naddition to Dr. Deming's formal and carefully cultivated plot, there is\r\nabout every farm a place where a man can stick a few trees and give them\r\nsuch care as can be given without tillage.\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: I agree heartily with Prof. Smith's theory, but having\r\nhad some experience, I find those things that he describes are not done;\r\nthere is just that difference, always, between theory and fact. I read a\r\nbeautiful book once, written by a woman, entitled, \"There is No Death,\"\r\nand I found on inquiry that she had already buried four husbands.\r\n(Laughter.) I was much interested in reading, once upon a time,\r\nRousseau's beautiful story of domestic life and I found that while he\r\nwas writing it, his children were in an orphan asylum. A fellow teaching\r\nin the high school in Terre Haute, Indiana, married one of the beautiful\r\nattractive young ladies of that town. Shortly after they were married he\r\nwas busy writing and turned and told her that he didn't love her any\r\nmore and he wished she'd go home. She was heartbroken and left and it\r\nturned out later that he was writing a book on how to get to Heaven.\r\n(Laughter.) There's just the difference between theory and fact. This\r\nis a beautiful theory. I used to be the strongest advocate of it, but\r\nall you've got to do is to go on a farm and try it. The trees won't get\r\nbig enough to amount to anything in our lifetime, because these things\r\nyou say you will do to them you don't do; at least, that has been my\r\nexperience, and I would like to ask anyone to point to any section in\r\nthe United States today, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific, where\r\nthis theory is carried out successfully; and yet I know it has been\r\nadvocated for fifty years.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: How about school children reporting on trees under their\r\ncare?\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: Whenever you give the proper care to them you solve the\r\nproblem--whenever anyone will convince me that that will be done. There\r\nis no reason, of course, why the tree won't grow in these places, but my\r\nexperience is that they don't thrive.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: I've put out thousands of them for public-spirited\r\ncitizens, but it would be difficult to find one of them today.\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: In France and in Germany the land is very valuable and they\r\ntake a great deal of pride in their nut trees. The nuts we have here in\r\nthe Lancaster market, Persian walnuts, are largely brought from France,\r\nSpain, Italy and Germany. The land being so valuable there, they devote\r\nmuch of their waste land to nuts, like Mr. Smith's idea of planting\r\nalong the wayside, and they plant and cultivate them in their yards and\r\nin all corners. They would not, under any consideration, plant a maple\r\ntree just for the shade; the tree must serve for both fruit and shade,\r\nand those are some of the sources of foreign wealth.\r\n\r\nMr. Harris: I don't think the question is so much one of planting in\r\nfence corners as that we have a great deal of waste land on which the\r\nsoil is very well adapted to growing nut trees. I know that sometimes in\r\ngrowing peach trees it is almost impossible to cultivate them. I know\r\nplaces in western Maryland where the rocks are lying so that you can\r\nhardly plough, and yet the soil is fertile and particularly adapted in\r\nsome places for peach trees, and would be for chestnut trees. They have\r\nthere a system of cultivation much as if you used the plough, and yet\r\nthey are on steep hillsides. There is no reason, I think, why nut trees\r\nshouldn't grow there as well as on the level field where you can\r\ncultivate every inch of soil.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: They are looked after, that's the whole thing.\r\n\r\nMr. Gowing: I come from New Hampshire and we have what used to be an old\r\nfarm, but it is now a pasture and the soil is quite a potash soil, I\r\nthink, amongst the rocks, and there's some apple trees planted there by\r\nthe original man that worked this place. It was too rough to plough, but\r\nthey have borne us as good apples some years as we have had on the\r\nplace; and on this same piece of twenty acres or so, there's some\r\nchestnut trees more than two feet through that were cut off when the\r\nland was cleared, and they must have done well, for they grew to be such\r\nenormous trees.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: The trees are planted on this same old stump land?\r\n\r\nMr. Gowing: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: A great deal of stump land can be planted in this way.\r\n\r\nMr. Corsan: That wouldn't be planting them along roadsides and in fence\r\ncorners.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: No, they would be looked after; the whole thing is looking\r\nafter them.\r\n\r\nA Member: My idea is that there would be very few nut trees planted if\r\nevery one was to start his own trees. They put off planting the trees\r\neven when they can get them at the nurseries, and if they had to start\r\ntheir own nurseries there wouldn't be one planted to where there's\r\n10,000 now; and I think that in the end the nurserymen are going to\r\nattend to the planting of trees and the other people are going to attend\r\nto growing them. Maybe I'm mistaken but did this Government ever produce\r\nany trees? Prof. Smith spoke of appropriating money and letting the\r\nGovernment get us some new variety. Hasn't it always been private\r\nindividuals who get the new varieties? I have been trying to think of\r\nsome fruit tree, apple or something, that a state or the Government has\r\npropagated.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: In this country I believe the Government has never done\r\nit, but in some parts of Europe, especially Switzerland, the taxes of\r\nsome towns are paid by the trees along the roadside; but there every man\r\nhas to report on his own trees and the proceeds go to support the town,\r\nand the taxes of certain small towns are actually paid today by roadside\r\ntrees; but this is in a country where land is valuable, and every tree\r\nis under the direct supervision of a citizen who must report on it, and\r\nthe product of that tree goes to the Government, he giving his labor\r\ninstead of paying taxes.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: I was merely pleading for the continuation and spread of\r\nthat work, both geographically and in increasing the varieties of trees.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: I am heartily in favor of that, but I think it ought to be\r\nreferred to a committee. I want Prof. Smith to write it out in the form\r\nof a letter.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: I am glad you called my attention to that.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: The Government and the states are now engaged in such work and\r\nthis ought to give it impetus. I think that the time and labor of the\r\nNut Growers Association, since its organization, will have been well\r\nspent if we succeed in bringing to fructification this one resolution. I\r\nwant also to suggest that Prof. Smith include among the nuts, the\r\nbeechnut, because there's more meat in beechnuts for the amount of shell\r\nthan any other nut we grow.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: If there is no further discussion, we will have now to\r\nspend a short time in Executive Committee work. I think we will ask to\r\nhave a Nominating Committee appointed first. Mr. Rush, will you kindly\r\nread the list of the names of the men you proposed to act as a\r\nNominating Committee?\r\n\r\nMr. Rush then moved that the Nominating Committee consist of Messrs.\r\nLake, Hutt, C. A. Reed, Smith and Deming, and the motion was adopted,\r\nafter which the Nominating Committee reported as follows: For President,\r\nMr. Littlepage; for Vice-President, Mr. C. A. Reed; for Secretary and\r\nTreasurer, Dr. Deming. On Executive Committee: Dr. Robert T. Morris, in\r\nplace of Mr. C. A. Reed. On Hybrids, Prof. J. R. Smith, in place of Mr.\r\nHenry Hicks. On Membership Committee, Mr. G. H. Corsan, in place of\r\nProf. E. R. Lake. On Committee on Nomenclature, Dr. W. C. Deming in\r\nplace of Prof. John Craig; the other committees to stand as heretofore.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: I move that the secretary be instructed to cast the ballot of\r\nthe association for these nominations.\r\n\r\nThe motion was seconded and adopted and the ballot cast in accordance\r\ntherewith.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Now I will appoint as a Committee on Resolutions relating\r\nto Prof. Craig, Dr. Deming and the Chairman; Committee on Exhibits, Col.\r\nVanDuzee, Mr. Roper and C. A. Reed, and they will be here this evening\r\nto report on exhibits. Committee on Resolutions, Prof. J. Russell Smith\r\nand Mr. T. P. Littlepage. There is no Committee on Incorporation. Will\r\nsomeone propose that we have such a committee?\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: Isn't it a desirable thing that the society should be\r\nincorporated? It was mentioned to me by a wealthy man that if anyone\r\nwished to leave, or give, some money to this association, they would be\r\nmuch more likely to do it if the society were incorporated.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: I think it would be better for someone to make a motion.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: I move that a Committee on Incorporation be appointed by the\r\nchairman; a committee of three.\r\n\r\n(Motion seconded and adopted.)\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: The Committee on Incorporation will consist of Mr.\r\nLittlepage and Prof. Close. This evening we will meet informally here at\r\nabout eight and tomorrow at ten we have the meeting at the Scenic to\r\nhear the papers of Mr. Rush and Prof. Lake and Prof. Reed, and see the\r\nlantern slides. We will first meet here at nine o'clock for an executive\r\nmeeting and to look over the exhibits. The Committees will report at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\n(After discussion, on motion of Prof. Smith, seconded by Mr. Littlepage,\r\nthe selection of the place of the next meeting was left to the Executive\r\nCommittee.)\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary and Treasurer was then read.\r\n\r\n(SEE APPENDIX)\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: You have heard the Secretary's report. We had better take\r\nup, first, the question of deficit. What are we going to do about the\r\n$66.00? What prospects have we for the balancing of that account?\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: That account will be easily balanced, and more than\r\nbalanced, by the dues coming in and then I will proceed to run up a\r\ndeficit for next year.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: You have heard the Secretary's report. If there is no\r\ndiscussion, a motion to adjourn will be in order.\r\n\r\n(Adjourned till December 19th.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Convention met, pursuant to adjournment, December 19th, 1912, at\r\n9:30 A. M., President Morris in the Chair, and went into Executive\r\nSession.\r\n\r\nIt was moved and carried that the President be empowered to appoint a\r\ncommittee to attend the conference at Albany, called for the\r\nconsideration of the hickory bark borer, by the Commissioner of\r\nAgriculture of the State of New York.\r\n\r\nThe question of the publication of reports of the Convention proceedings\r\nin the American Fruit and Nut Journal, was next taken up and it was\r\nmoved by Mr. Lake and carried that the papers and discussions of this\r\nSociety shall be used for its own publications exclusively, except as\r\nthe Executive Committee deems it to the best interests of the industry\r\nto furnish them for separate publication.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: On November 8th, I received a letter from Calvin J.\r\nHuson, the Commissioner of Agriculture of New York, to this effect.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nAt the coming land show in New York this department proposes to have, as\r\na part of its exhibit, a collection of native and introduced New York\r\ngrown nuts.\r\n\r\nCan you give us the names of growers of the better strains of nuts who\r\nmight be able to furnish material for such an exhibit. Perhaps your\r\nassociation would be able to assist in the matter. The Department will\r\nbe able to stand a reasonable expense for cost of nuts, expressage, etc.\r\nPerhaps a few seedling trees would add interest.... By the exhibit as a\r\nwhole we wish to show the variety and quality of nuts that may be grown\r\nin this state....\r\n\r\n                        Very truly yours,\r\n                               CALVIN J. HUSON,\r\n                                  Commissioner.\r\n\r\nHe wished me to assist in getting up an exhibit, but as he only gave us\r\na week I was unable to do anything. I do not know that there is any\r\naction to be taken on that, but I read the letter simply to show that\r\nthe interest in nut growing is increasing and that this is an\r\nopportunity for us to make an exhibit another year.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: Would the secretary take the trouble to make a collection of\r\nnuts covering the territory of the association and submit it for exhibit\r\nat a meeting of this character, this land show, giving credit to the\r\ndonors for material, somewhat as Mr. Reed has done in pecans for the\r\nNational Nut Growers Association?\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: I think I'd have a few minutes to spare to do that.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: I think it would be an admirable thing.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Yes, it would advertise the organization extensively and\r\nbe a constructive step in agriculture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage, have you any report from the Committee on Incorporation?\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: That is a matter that will require considerable thought\r\nand attention. It will require attention from several standpoints, as\r\nfor example under what laws we might wish to incorporate, so I think the\r\ncommittee will reserve its report to make to the Executive Committee at\r\nsome later meeting.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: We have no other business, I believe, and will now retire\r\nto the hall where we will have the lantern slide exhibition. The morning\r\nsession closes the meeting and we are to meet at two o'clock at the\r\nMonument and from there go out to see certain trees in the vicinity. Mr.\r\nRush and Mr. Jones are to show us these and their two nurseries.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: I would like to offer as a resolution, that the secretary be\r\ninstructed to make arrangements with the publishers of the American\r\nFruit and Nut Journal for the distribution of one copy to each member as\r\na part of his membership fee. The secretary will then be able to reach\r\nthe members in his published notices without special printers' troubles\r\nof his own, and the members will be able to get some live matter right\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nThe motion was seconded and adopted, after which the executive session\r\nclosed and the members adjourned in a body to the Scenic Theatre, where\r\nthe regular program was resumed as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: We will have Mr. Rush's paper first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERSIAN WALNUT, ITS DISASTER AND LESSONS FOR 1912\r\n\r\nJ. G. RUSH, PENNSYLVANIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year just closing has been full of disasters both on land and sea,\r\nthough I do not wish it to be understood that I am inclined to be a\r\npessimist on account of these occurrences.\r\n\r\nI wish to speak of a disaster which overtook the walnut industry in the\r\nnorthern states. Early in the year we had an arctic cold wave which put\r\nthe thermometer from 23 to 33 degrees below zero. This cold wave\r\napparently did no injury to the walnut trees at the time but late in the\r\nspring it was discovered that the wood cells were ruptured though the\r\nbuds and bark were uninjured. In cutting the scions in early April the\r\nbark and buds seemed in good condition for grafting; but as the time\r\napproached to do the work it was readily seen, by its changed color,\r\nthat the wood was injured, some scions of course more than others. Those\r\nthat were only slightly discolored were used in grafting. But as time\r\npassed the unhappy result came to light that out of about 2,000 nursery\r\ntrees grafted only one graft grew. After climbing an 80 foot walnut tree\r\nto get our scions, and paying a good price for them besides, this was\r\nrather discouraging.\r\n\r\nThis cold wave, which was unprecedented for the time, had wrought other\r\ninjuries to the nut industry. That was especially to the young trees\r\nthat were transplanted the fall previous and last spring. The\r\ntransplanting with a frost injury already was too great a strain on the\r\nfeeble life of the trees. The consequence was that some of them died\r\noutright, and others made only a feeble growth. But where low and severe\r\npruning was practised good results followed and such trees as were\r\nestablished on the original root system escaped the frost injury\r\nentirely. The young nursery trees with dormant buds were not affected in\r\nthe least but made a strong growth of from three to seven feet this last\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nThe intense cold wave was such that some old and young seedling Persian\r\nwalnut trees were killed outright, and not only the Persian walnut but\r\nin a few instances the American black was very much injured; likewise\r\nthe Norway maple, magnolia, California privet and roses. Also the peach\r\nboth in tree and fruit.\r\n\r\nNow in conclusion let me say, what is the lesson to be learned? First,\r\nas to the propagation of the Persian walnut, great care should be taken\r\nthat only trees that are hardy should be propagated from, as well as\r\nhaving good bearing qualities with a first class nut. Second, after a\r\nfreeze such as we had last winter, a special effort should be made to\r\nsave the newly planted tree by close and severe pruning. As, for\r\nexample, I had a very fine two year old Hall Persian walnut which was\r\nreferred to me as dead. I cut the tree off about 4 inches above where it\r\nwas budded on the black walnut stock. It was not long after that signs\r\nof new life appeared and eventually it made a very fine, handsome tree.\r\nNature does indeed some wonderful tricks in this respect by which we can\r\nlearn valuable lessons; and chief of these is close pruning.\r\n\r\nSuch a cold wave may visit us only once in a lifetime and should not\r\ndiscourage us from carrying nut culture to its highest development. We\r\nmust not think for a moment that other walnut sections are exempt from\r\nsimilar visitations. They have them in the Pacific Northwest, and in\r\nFrance and Germany.\r\n\r\nAs regards the walnut industry for Lancaster county or Pennsylvania in\r\ngeneral, I am safe in saying that a fair percentage of the farmers are\r\ntaking hold of it. This is because of the fact that the San Jose scale\r\nhas practically destroyed all the old apple trees around the farm\r\nbuildings, and, not wishing to have the building denuded of the\r\ncustomary shade and fruit, nut trees are planted instead. This is in\r\nreality the practice prevalent in France and Germany where they utilize\r\nevery foot of ground to profitable account.\r\n\r\nThe life of an apple tree is from fifty to sixty years whereas a walnut\r\ntree is just in its prime at that age and destined to live for hundreds\r\nof years afterwards. Then again the ravages of the chestnut tree blight\r\nare destroying the cultivated paragons just as freely as the chestnuts\r\nin the forests, which in a few years will be things of the past, thus\r\ngiving still more room for walnut and other nut trees.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Nut Growers Association was organized for a grand and noble\r\npurpose, that is to stand together shoulder to shoulder to devise ways\r\nand means to bring nut culture to a grand and glorious success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Corsan: The temperature Mr. Rush spoke of rather surprises me. Last\r\nyear at Toronto it did not fall lower than 9 degrees below zero. We had\r\nsummer almost until New Year's and then a very severe winter until\r\nApril. I didn't notice any evergreen trees killed, but at Detroit, the\r\nBronx and various other places, I never saw a winter so disastrous for\r\nkilling evergreens.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Not only that but nurserymen all over eastern New England\r\nsaid they suffered greater losses last winter than ever before.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: I would like to ask Mr. Rush if it would be possible to cut\r\nscions by December 1st, so as to escape danger from such great freezes.\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: I really have little experience in keeping scions. This fall I\r\nput some in the moist cold earth in the cellar. I think the experiment\r\nwill be successful because I have known chestnut scions cut in the fall,\r\nto be kept under leaves in the grove till spring.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: I should like to suggest that you try the following\r\nexperiment; bury them, wrapped up in a gunny-sack or something, entirely\r\nunderground where they will have absolute moisture and be shut away from\r\nthe air. I have found that very successful.\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: Sometimes the trouble is they get too moist.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: There is a principle here, and we had better keep down to\r\nprinciples as much as we can. That principle is that if the cells of the\r\nscions are distended with water a certain chemical process is going on\r\nall the while, because a scion is just as much alive as the red\r\nsquirrel; it is a living organism. Now then, if the cells are a very\r\nlittle below normal dryness the chemical processes mostly cease, and\r\nthat is better. We have to use nice judgment in avoiding having a scion\r\nso dry that its cells perish or so moist that its cells are undergoing\r\nchemical processes too rapidly. Our scions are cut, say, the last of\r\nNovember, then covered with leaves enough to prevent freezing and\r\nthawing. That will carry scions pretty well through the winter and\r\nperhaps is the best way, but we must never forget that in dealing with\r\nscions we are dealing with living red squirrels just as when we are\r\ndealing with pollen.\r\n\r\nA Member: Are the leaves moist or dry?\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: The driest leaves in the woods contain more water than you\r\nthink they do. They carry enough to maintain the life of the cells, if\r\nthey are packed pretty firmly about your scions, and at the same time\r\nthe scions are still allowed to breathe. I keep them above ground. I put\r\na layer of shingles on the cellar floor, if I've got a bare ground\r\ncellar floor, and then a layer of very fine leaves like locust leaves,\r\nthen a single layer of scions and then a good big heap of leaves over\r\nthose, packed tight, a good big heap of apple leaves or anything you\r\nhave at hand. Try it on the basis of principles. It is a complex\r\nquestion. You can't settle any of these questions off-hand. Every man\r\nwho has had much experience has learned that he needs a whole lot more.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: Have you had any experience in fixing up a bed of scions\r\nlike that and putting it in cold storage?\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Yes, but you must tell the cold storage people not to let\r\nthem get too dry. Tell them you want them in moist cold storage, and to\r\nkeep the temperature about 40.\r\n\r\nA Member: We have found with walnuts that if you have the scions too\r\ndamp they won't keep very long. If you have them just moist enough to\r\nhold them you can keep them all winter, maybe indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: If your cell is full of water the scion will work as hard\r\nas an Irishman.\r\n\r\nA Member: I find that we have to graft them above ground, in the North,\r\nand if they are too moist when grafted they will dry up, but if kept dry\r\nthey will grow, because they will remain in good condition until the sap\r\ncomes up in the stock.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Yes, you must choose a position midway between too dry and\r\ntoo moist.\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: That is very important; they won't stand dampness.\r\n\r\nMr. Pomeroy: Wouldn't it be well to dip the cut end of the walnut scion\r\nin wax to hold the sap?\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: I am afraid that would stop its breathing. You are dealing\r\nwith a red squirrel all the while, remember that.\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: My method is this: I have a little room about six feet wide\r\nwith ice packs on both sides and double doors. In that I pack my scions\r\nin this way: I take carbide cans made of iron and put damp sawdust,\r\nabout an inch or so, on the bottom and then I pack my scions in the\r\ncans, cut end down, then I put the top on loosely. I have carried them\r\nover the second year in that way.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: But you let them breathe all the while?\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: Certainly, and they have but very little moisture. They are\r\nkept in a temperature of about 40 degrees.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: How often do you wet that sawdust?\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: Not once.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Well, that's in keeping with our theoretical basis.\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: I cut scions any time between now and March. I don't take\r\nthem out of storage until we use them. We graft up to the middle of\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: I found some hickory scions that had been accidentally\r\noverlooked, kept under leaves, and the buds in the cambium were\r\nperfectly good after two years. In regard to winter injury--in the\r\nvicinity of Stamford, Conn., the nurserymen reported greater losses of\r\nall kinds in nursery stock than they had had before in their experience.\r\nI noticed that some small branches of the Persian walnuts had been\r\ninjured, and particularly where grafts had started a little late and had\r\nnot lignified quite thoroughly I lost whatever grafts had not had time\r\nto lignify. Last winter the injuries in our vicinity consisted chiefly\r\nof two kinds; occasional killing of the small branches--this does little\r\nharm because, where the branch is killed and dies back for a certain\r\ndistance, we have three or four more branches starting up, so that\r\nperhaps it is not sophistical to say that it does the tree good. We get\r\na larger bearing area than if it were not for this occasional freezing\r\nof small branches. Another form of injury occurs in the spring. The sap\r\nwill start to ascend when we have warm days in February and March; then\r\na few cold days come and, if we have absolutely freezing temperature at\r\nnight, this sap freezes and when it freezes it expands, as water does\r\neverywhere, and the result is a bursting of the bark. That is an\r\noccasional happening with all trees but particularly with exotics. One\r\nkind of winter injury has been overlooked in connection with the walnut.\r\nThe very last thing which the tree does in the autumn is to complete its\r\nbuds for female flowers. That is the very last job the tree has on hand\r\nand if the tree cannot complete the buds for female flowers perfectly,\r\nthen a very little wood killing will make that a barren tree, although\r\nit appears to be a good strong tree. That covers the kinds of winter\r\ninjury I have seen in the vicinity of Stamford, Conn.\r\n\r\n(Here Col. C. K. Sober of Pennsylvania showed lantern slide views of his\r\norchards of paragon chestnuts and his methods.)\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: We will have now Mr. Reed's address with lantern views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA 1912 REVIEW OF THE NUT SITUATION IN THE NORTH\r\n\r\nC. A. REED, WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn taking up the question of the present status of the nut industry of\r\nthe Northern States, we have to do more with what has not been\r\naccomplished than with what has been. Very little has been done toward\r\ndeveloping the northern chestnut. What has been done has been mostly\r\nwith the European species and so far that has not been very\r\nsatisfactory. The European species is quite subject to the blight. The\r\nJapanese nut is not ordinarily of a quality equal to that of the\r\nAmerican. It is thought, too, that with the Japanese chestnut the\r\nchestnut blight has been introduced, which has been so serious to our\r\nnative species. The walnut has not become well established in the\r\neastern states. So far, most of the European nuts that have been\r\nimported have been too tender to adapt themselves to our climatic\r\nconditions, and the filbert, when brought from Europe, proves quite\r\nsubject to a blight that prevails everywhere with our native species,\r\nbut with them is not so serious. In running over these slides, I will\r\nbegin first with the chestnut. That is perhaps the best known species in\r\nthis locality. That shows one of our native chestnut trees as it is\r\nfamiliar to you all in a great part of this territory under discussion,\r\nthat is, the part of the United States east of the Mississippi River and\r\nnorth of the Potomac. That photograph was taken some time last June or\r\nJuly when the tree was in full bloom. The chestnut is one of the most\r\nbeautiful of our native nut trees. This tree has the blight in one of\r\nthe earlier stages and it is shown here merely to call attention to the\r\ndisease, because no discussion of the chestnut industry at the present\r\ntime can be complete without at least calling attention to the\r\nseriousness of that blight. That tree, perhaps, has not been affected\r\nmore than two years, possibly one. Is that right, Mr. Pierce?\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce: About two. That's an 18 or 20 inch tree, isn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce: It must be an 18 or 20 inch tree to be so badly blighted at\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: Two years, but you see it's pretty well gone. We come now to\r\nthe Paragon, one of the first trees of that variety ever propagated. It\r\nwas planted where it stands, by the introducer, Mr. Henry M. Engel, at\r\nMarietta, where they had quite an orchard at one time, but the blight is\r\nso serious that there are only a few specimens of the trees left. That\r\ntree is probably in the neighborhood of twenty-five years old. The next\r\nslide shows two trees of the same variety that we may possibly see this\r\nafternoon. They are on the farm belonging to Mr. Rush and they are about\r\ntwenty years old.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: What have those trees yielded?\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: They yield four, five, six and seven to eight bushels. You can\r\nsee that they are not far from the barn and the roots run under that\r\nbarnyard manure pile.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: What would you consider an average crop?\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: They grow five or six bushels per tree.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: The greatest attention that has been paid to developing the\r\nparagon chestnut in orchard farming has been on the plan Mr. Sober has\r\njust shown, by clearing away the mountain side and cutting down\r\neverything but the chestnut sprouts. This photograph was taken in a\r\nthicket where the underbrush had not been cleared away. Those are a good\r\nage now or perhaps a little bit older than we usually graft, aren't\r\nthey, Mr. Sober?\r\n\r\nMr. Sober: Yes, sir; one or two years old. When they get to be three\r\nyears old they are past grafting, according to my method.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: This photograph was taken at Mr. Sober's a little over a year\r\nago, taken in the rain and is not very clear, but it shows the distance\r\nbetween the trees at the time when these trees were four or five years\r\nold--is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. Sober: They are eleven year old trees.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: Do you thin them out after they get that size?\r\n\r\nMr. Sober: Yes, sir, they should be thinned out more, but I hesitated on\r\naccount of the blight; I have thousands that I could spare, but for fear\r\nthe blight will take them out.\r\n\r\nA Member: Do you cultivate the ground?\r\n\r\nMr. Sober: I don't cultivate it, I just pasture it. The land is\r\nfertilized, but not cultivated.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: That is a photograph of a large chestnut orchard in this\r\ncounty. It is not many miles from here. I understand that owing to the\r\nblight and to the weevil, that orchard has not been satisfactory, and I\r\nwas told two or three days ago that it was being cleared away.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: What varieties?\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: Paragon and native stock.\r\n\r\nA Member: Was that the old Furness Grove?\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: Yes, sir. That slide shows the congeniality, ordinarily,\r\nbetween the stock of the native chestnut and the paragon. The next slide\r\nshows a typical instance of malformation between the Japanese and native\r\nchestnut. I understand that this is not unusual at all. The Japanese,\r\nordinarily, does not make a good union with the American sweet chestnut.\r\nThat slide was taken in Indiana. It is a twenty-five acre paragon\r\norchard owned by Mr. Littlepage and Senator Bourne of Oregon, planted in\r\nthe spring of 1910. The next slide shows one of the trees in the orchard\r\nduring its first season. Mr. Littlepage had to have them all gone over\r\nand the burs removed. They were so inclined to fruit during the first\r\nseason that they would have exhausted themselves if the burs had not\r\nbeen removed. They made a very promising start, but I understand from\r\nMr. Littlepage that a number of the trees have since died. Is there\r\nanything you'd like to add to that, Mr. Littlepage?\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: I haven't yet quite determined the cause of the trouble.\r\nLast winter I lost perhaps one-third of the trees with a peculiar\r\ncondition. The wood under the bark was darkened. I sent some of them to\r\nWashington the year before to see if there was any blight or fungus and\r\nthey reported there was none on any of the trees, but this winter\r\nperhaps one-third of the trees died down to the graft. A few, however,\r\nwould sprout from the scion, giving me, of course, the grafted top\r\nagain. It seemed to indicate, perhaps, a winter killing and yet I would\r\nnot undertake to assert that that was the cause, but it was very\r\nserious.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: Was the land low or high?\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: High land along a hillside, very excellent land for\r\nchestnuts.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: Sandy loam?\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: No, it's a hilly clay with a considerable humus and set\r\nin clover.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Which way does it face?\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: South.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: That is rather bad.\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: I don't know. I have some over on the other side of the\r\nhill and I don't know whether the killing was greater on the other side\r\nor not.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: We have before us a view of the original Rochester and its\r\noriginator, Mr. E. A. Reihl, of Alton, Ill. Over in the Court House we\r\nhave on exhibition nuts of that variety which most of you have seen. You\r\nare aware, probably, that it is a native chestnut. It is one of the\r\nlargest and best of the native chestnuts and originated in southern\r\nIllinois, where so far the blight has not spread. It gives considerable\r\npromise for the future. We come back now to Lancaster county to a\r\nchinkapin tree, a hybrid chinkapin. The original tree stands in a forest\r\nin this county, and as you notice there, it is a very good sized tree.\r\nYou might think from the looks of the photograph that that is a\r\nchestnut, but the nuts are small and borne in racemes, so they are\r\ntypical chinkapins.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: One parent was a chestnut?\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: We don't know; it's a native tree; it's a hybrid.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: It's a supposed hybrid.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: Yes, the chestnut and chinkapin grow close together.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: What is the form of the nuts?\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: Round like a chinkapin. I think it was a chestnut on a\r\nchinkapin.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: If it is a chinkapin, what is there to indicate that there is\r\nany chestnut blood in it?\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: The size of the tree and the fact that the nut matures with\r\nthe chestnut. The chinkapin is about three weeks earlier than this\r\nvariety of chinkapin.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: That photograph is typical of the Rush hybrid chinkapin. We\r\ntake up the butternut now. So far as we know, there are no named\r\nvarieties of the butternut; there cannot be until some good individual\r\ntree is found which is of sufficient merit to entitle it to propagation\r\nby budding and grafting. It is one of the best known nuts in our field,\r\nespecially in New England; it is more common there than it is further\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThis slide shows the native butternut in the forests of southern Indiana\r\nnear the Ohio River. Of course, those trees in forests like that don't\r\nmature many nuts. It is not in the forests, ordinarily, that you will\r\nfind individual trees of sufficient merit to entitle them to\r\npropagation. It is the tree in the open that has had greater\r\nopportunities than are afforded in the forest.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: Are there any coniferous trees in that forest?\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: No, that's an alluvial bottom, Mr. Lake. There is quite\r\na long bottom by the creek where the butternut grows profusely. We have\r\nthe same tree on the farm that Senator Bourne and I own. Hundreds of\r\nthose trees grow in the woods there. It's rich alluvial soil.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: The fact that it is rich alluvial soil does not usually bar\r\nconiferous trees; it may in your section.\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: There are none there.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: The slide before us shows typical black walnuts that are\r\nalmost as common, perhaps more so, in many parts of the area under\r\ndiscussion, than the butternut. This photograph was taken in Michigan\r\nwhere the trees are growing along fence rows without cultivation or\r\nspecial attention. No one knows whether the nuts of those trees are of\r\nspecial value or not. It merely shows the starting point for improvement\r\nin the walnut. We come now to the Persian walnut, which Mr. Lake will\r\ndiscuss more fully in a few minutes. This is one of the trees we will\r\nprobably have an opportunity to see this afternoon. It is between Mr.\r\nRush's nursery and the station, on the right hand side as you are going\r\nout. Just above the top of the fence you will notice a dark line which\r\nindicates the point of union. The Persian walnut was grafted on the\r\nblack stock. The Persian is of slightly greater diameter. Now we have\r\nMr. Rush in his walnut nursery. These are seedling walnuts in their\r\nthird year.\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: Second year.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: Second year from the time of planting. You will notice the\r\nluxuriant growth. The next slide shows the methods of propagation. This\r\nis the first step in the operation. The knife is similar to those on the\r\ntables in the Court House. The next slide shows the second stage in the\r\noperation where the bark has been lifted and Mr. Rush holds the bud of\r\nthe Persian walnut in the fingers of his left hand, and the next slide\r\nshows the bud in position and being held firmly by a finger of the left\r\nhand. As soon as it is in position like that, Mr. Rush lifts the\r\npencil--the instrument that he holds in the right hand and folds the\r\nbark back over the new bud and then cuts it on the outside, so that he\r\nmakes a perfect fit. If anything, the bark of the black walnut overlaps\r\nslightly the bark of the bud, and the third step in the operation is the\r\nwrapping. Below, right at this point, is a completed operation. That was\r\ndone in August, using buds of the present season's growth, and in about\r\nhow many days is it that you take off the wrapping?\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: About two weeks.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: In about two weeks take off the wrapping; and about how much\r\nlonger is it before you get a growth like that?\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: About two weeks more, three weeks more.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: In about four or five weeks from the time of the operation a\r\ngrowth like that is not uncommon.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: When is the top cut off?\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: When I see that growth is taking place I cut the top off in\r\norder to encourage the growth to get strong enough for the winter. Of\r\ncourse our object is to keep the bud dormant until the following season,\r\nperfectly dormant, but sometimes they do make a growth and, if they do,\r\ncut them off at the top and force them. You will not get that bud to\r\ngrow next summer, but another bud starts out below that branch and gives\r\nyou your tree.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: That one dies then?\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: Yes, sir, invariably dies.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: There is one of Mr. Rush's own growing of the Rush walnut, a\r\nlittle tree which, in its second season, matured two nuts. That\r\nphotograph was taken just about the time the nuts were ready to be\r\ngathered.\r\n\r\nMr. Corsan: I noticed in the nurseries at the Michigan Agricultural\r\nCollege, a lot of black walnuts that were sun-scalded. They were too far\r\napart. Can anyone tell us anything about this danger of sun-scald to the\r\ntrunk?\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: Well, in this particular instance, the tree stands right next\r\nto a fence, so it is protected from the hot sun during a large part of\r\nthe season. Perhaps Mr. Rush could tell us whether he has had any\r\ntrouble with sun-scald.\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: Not at all, none whatever, never.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: There is, in some localities, a great deal of danger from\r\nsun-scald. In the vicinity of Stamford, Conn., most of the English\r\nwalnuts will sun-scald more or less unless we look out for that and give\r\nthem shade; mostly in the trunk below the branches.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: How about the nuts?\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: I haven't seen any scalding there.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: These are all interesting points and I am glad to have them\r\nthrown in. Mr. Rush can tell us about this slide. It is one of the\r\ncut-leafed varieties of walnut from California that he is propagating.\r\nIt is more of an ornament than it is a commercial nut, isn't it?\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: It is both combined. It is very productive and very hardy. The\r\nnut is not quite as large as the Nebo. It is the cut-leafed weeping\r\nwalnut. The first tree that came from California cost twenty dollars. It\r\nis very ornamental.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: This is a view of a seedling Persian walnut orchard in Bucks\r\ncounty, this state, some twenty or thirty miles north of Philadelphia.\r\nIt is now about ten years of age and is owned by Mrs. J. L. Lovett, of\r\nEmilie. Some of the nuts of this orchard are on exhibition over in the\r\nCourt House. The orchard was not given any special cultivation at the\r\ntime this photograph was taken. The nuts from the trees, of course, are\r\nvery ununiform, being seedlings, and the bearing of the trees is not\r\nespecially large, but the apparent thrift and vigor of these trees gives\r\na good deal of ground for looking forward to a walnut industry in the\r\neastern states.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: Do you know the origin of the seed?\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: No, sir, we do not. The nuts from which those trees were\r\nplanted were obtained and planted by Mr. Lovett who is now deceased.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: One of the most important features, it seems to me, of\r\ngrafting, is the idea that we can graft from prolific trees. The\r\nmajority of trees, of walnuts, hickories, anything you please, are not\r\nremarkably prolific, but in grafting you select a tree that is prolific\r\nas one of the most desirable of its qualities.\r\n\r\nA Member: You say that this grove was given no particular cultivation;\r\nare they careful to allow all the foliage to remain on the ground where\r\nit drops?\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: I couldn't answer as to that.\r\n\r\nA Member: Mr. Sober, do you do that?\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nA Member: The point I wanted to make is that that is probably very much\r\nbetter than any cultivation that could be given.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: The matter of cultivation is one we have got to settle in\r\nthis country. I have been over the walnut orchards on the Pacific coast,\r\nin the East and in Europe, and I find three entirely separate and\r\ndistinct methods of treatment. On the Pacific coast, the rule is to\r\ncultivate every year and irrigate where they can, but to cultivate, at\r\nany rate, whether they irrigate or not. In the East, where people are\r\nsupposed to be very industrious, we have adopted the lazier way of\r\nletting the trees grow in sod; but that is not so bad if we follow the\r\nprinciple brought forward by Stringfellow of letting the leaves all\r\ndecompose, and adding more fertilizer and more leaves and taking away\r\nnothing. In France and Germany and England, where the trees are\r\ncultivated, particularly in France, where they are best cultivated, we\r\nfind two methods; first, keeping up clean cultivation and adding a\r\nlittle lime every year and, second, add lime without the cultivation.\r\nOne great feature of the treatment of the tree in France, where the best\r\nwalnuts come from, is the addition of a little lime every year, even if\r\nit's a limestone ground, and that may possibly account for the delicate\r\ncharacter of the French walnuts and the reason why they have the first\r\ncall in the market. I don't know that that is true, but it seems to me,\r\nat least, a collateral fact, and collateral facts often mean something.\r\n\r\nMr. Pomeroy: Judging from my own experience I think that that orchard\r\nwould be producing now two or two and a half bushels per tree each year\r\nif put under cultivation and given the care of an ordinary peach\r\norchard.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: These are seedling trees, you understand, in that orchard we\r\nshowed. This is a Persian walnut tree in Mr. Rush's front yard. I've\r\nforgotten the variety.\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: That is the Kaghazi.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: Now we come to the original hickories. This is one of the\r\nearliest hickory nuts propagated, in fact, it's about the only one so\r\nfar. That tree is owned by Mr. Henry Hales of Ridgewood, N. J.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: Have they fertilized it?\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: No, not especially. It stands on good, fertile soil but I\r\nthink no attention has ever been paid to it in the way of cultivation.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: Have you its yielding record?\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: It never made large records; as I recall it now, it has never\r\nborne more than a few bushels at any one time, perhaps two bushels.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: One reason is because it has been cut back regularly every\r\nyear for scions?\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: Yes, that's true.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: Over two hundred years old, then?\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: I doubt if that tree is over fifty or sixty.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: That's what I should say,--somewhere in the neighborhood of\r\nfifty or sixty years old.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: That slide shows a typical grafted tree in Mr. Hales' garden.\r\nIt's a nice shapely, thrifty tree about seven years old and only\r\nrecently came into bearing to any extent. The nurserymen have had great\r\ndifficulty in propagating it until recently. Now that Mr. Jones has come\r\nup from the South and he and Mr. Rush are getting down together\r\nearnestly in the propagation of these northern trees, we will probably\r\nhave more of them, but in all the years that Mr. Hales has been working\r\nwith that particular variety, he has never been able to get more than a\r\nfew trees grown in the nursery, so it is not disseminated to any extent.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Do you think that this will be like the pecan and hickory,\r\nthat some varieties will bear fifteen years after grafting and other\r\nvarieties two years after grafting, for instance, as extremes?\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: Probably so, the same as it is with other fruits.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: It seems to me that that is what we may fairly anticipate.\r\n\r\nMr. Corsan: Like Northern Spy apples and other apples.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: This slide is a little bit out of order. It's a native Persian\r\nwalnut tree that stands in this county. It is owned by Mr. Harness. Mr.\r\nRush has propagated it under the name of Geit. That photograph was taken\r\nin the fall of 1911. Last year it suffered greatly during the extreme\r\nweather, but it came out again and made a very good growth. This is the\r\noriginal Rush tree that we may be able to see this afternoon. And this\r\nis the original Nebo that we had hoped to be able to see but will\r\nprobably not succeed. It is some seven or eight miles from Mr. Rush's\r\nhome and we will hardly be able to make it this afternoon. The slide\r\nbefore us shows some European filberts that were planted by Mr. Hales\r\nand up to the present time they are doing nicely although they have\r\nnever fruited especially heavily; but there is no blight.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: How many years?\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: I think those are ten to twelve years old. Perhaps you have\r\nseen them.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Yes. There are two features connected with the filbert\r\nthat we ought to discuss right here. One is the tendency to its being\r\ndestroyed by the blight of our American hazel, which extends to Indiana,\r\nand another is the fact that it blossoms so early that the female\r\nflowers or the male flowers are both apt to be killed by the frost. All\r\nthe members of this Association ought to get to work to bring out a\r\nvariety which will have the blight-resisting features and the later\r\nblooming of the American hazel.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: This slide shows a filbert we will probably be able to see\r\nthis afternoon. It is in Mr. Rush's door yard and is still pretty young.\r\nI believe it has not borne of any account.\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: It has borne a little.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: How old is it?\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: I think it's about five years old. It is a Barcelona.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: The next slide is taken in the orchard of Mr. Kerr at Denton,\r\nMd. At one time he had a very nice orchard of these filberts, but the\r\nblight has gotten in and has about wiped out everything. In a letter\r\nfrom him this fall he said he had very few nuts of any variety, although\r\nhe did have a few. A letter that came this week from J. W. Killen, of\r\nFelton, Md., said he had found filberts to be about as unprofitable a\r\nnut, as any he could have grown.\r\n\r\nWe will spend a few minutes now running over the pecan situation. We can\r\nhardly omit it altogether because there are so many people in the\r\nnorthern states who are interested in the pecan in a financial way. The\r\nchart before us shows first the native area. This part here is the\r\nportion of the United States in which the pecan is a native. You notice\r\nhow far upward it extends, almost to Terre Haute, Indiana, and across\r\nsouthern Indiana along the Ohio River, and it is right in here, about\r\nwhere the pencil indicates that some of our best northern varieties have\r\noriginated. Mr. Littlepage and W. C. Reed and others have shown us nuts\r\nover in the Court House that originated there. The Busseron and the\r\nIndiana are the two most northern. They are a little way north of\r\nVincennes. No varieties so far of any merit have originated in Illinois.\r\nWhile we have the map of Illinois before us, I would like to point out\r\nthe place where Mr. Riehl originated the variety of chestnut we referred\r\nto some time ago. Down in more southern Illinois is where we find Mr.\r\nEndicott. This darkened area along the southeastern part of the United\r\nStates, and extending away up into Virginia, shows the area to which the\r\npecan has been planted with more or less success. This area extending\r\ndown over the Piedmont and up into Virginia and West Virginia, is the\r\nmountain area to which the pecan is not adapted. You never find pecans\r\non the uplands. This thick, heavy area shows the territory within which\r\nthe pecan has been most extensively planted. It is not common down in\r\nsouthern Florida. You notice, too, that over here in Texas there have\r\nbeen very few orchards planted to pecans. North of these shaded areas,\r\nanywhere up in Ohio or Pennsylvania or New York, the pecan has not shown\r\nany adaptability or has not shown sufficient adaptability to justify\r\ncommercial planting. Whatever planting of pecans is done in the area\r\nnorth of the shaded portions there must be considered as experimental.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: The southern part of Texas is actually in the tropical\r\nzone. It would be interesting to know if we have the pecan actually\r\ngrowing in the tropics.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: We have more or less vague reports that it is growing down\r\nnear Brownsville. I think Mr. Littlepage told us the other day of a\r\nfriend of his who is planting pecans.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Brownsville is very close to the tropics.\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: Mr. Yoacum told me he had a grove down there that had\r\nnot been a success so far. I know that quite a number of people have\r\ndiscussed the question of planting pecans in that section.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: This is one of the largest of pecan trees; it is the largest\r\nthat it has ever been my personal privilege to see. It has a\r\ncircumference of between 18 and 19 feet and a spread of about 125 feet.\r\nWe estimated that it was about the same height. It stands on the west\r\nside of the Mississippi River, some distance south of Baton Rouge.\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: What is the approximate water level below the ground?\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: It is quite near the surface.\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: I thought so. There are conditions you will observe that\r\nare unusual. In lands where the water level is near the surface, there\r\nis a tendency in the tree to shove out a lot of surface roots. You can\r\ntravel all over the pecan belt of Indiana and will never see a pecan\r\ntree that does not look as if it had been driven in the ground with a\r\npile-driver, but I have noticed that you find those spreading roots\r\nwhere the water level is near the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: It is interesting to know that right near this tree were other\r\nlarge trees, nearly as large, that were blown over, and they showed no\r\ntap-roots, but merely the surface roots, This slide shows a pecan bloom.\r\nThe pistillate bloom is clear up on the terminate growth; the staminate,\r\nlike other nut trees, is on the growth of last season and comes out\r\nsomewhat in advance of the pistillate, necessarily.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the wild pecans of Texas. The recent census figures show\r\nthat fully three-fifths of all the pecans produced in the United States\r\ncome from Texas. This photograph shows the native wild pecans along the\r\nColorado River. Here is the pecan as a park tree. This picture was taken\r\nin Llana Park, New Braunfels, in west Texas. One of the nuisances in\r\npecan trees is illustrated in the upper part of this photograph; you\r\nwill notice the Spanish moss that grows so densely on the pecan trees if\r\nneglected. Unless the moss is kept out it gets so dense that it smothers\r\nthe fruiting and leafing surface, so trees that are densely covered with\r\nthat are able to make leaves only on the terminals. You notice in the\r\nrear the leaves of bananas that grow there throughout the entire year.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: I have noticed that the mistletoe was a bad parasite on\r\nthe pecans in some regions. Have you found that?\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: Yes, that is true; that is one of the pests of the pecan. This\r\nslide shows a typical Texas scene. The wild pecans have been gathered\r\nand are brought into town and are waiting the buyers. You will notice\r\nright here is a bag that has been stood up and opened, waiting for a\r\nbuyer, the same as we see grain in the streets of northern towns, and\r\nhere are pecans on their way from the warehouse to the car. The next\r\nslide shows another step; they are on their way now from Texas to the\r\ncrackery or the wholesalers. The crop of pecans in Texas alone usually\r\nruns from 200 cars to 600 or 700 cars. This year the crop is small and\r\nprobably not over 200 cars, so the prices are going up. This is the\r\npecan crackery in San Antonio, having a capacity of 20,000 pounds a day.\r\nThe pecans are cracked by machinery and the kernels are picked out by\r\nhand. This slide shows a native pecan tree. The one in the foreground\r\nwas from across the river near Vincennes. It is one of the first\r\nnorthern varieties that was introduced, but it is now superseded. The\r\nnext is the original tree of the Busseron. The nuts from that tree are\r\non exhibition over at the Court House brought here by Mr. Reed. The tree\r\nwas cut back quite severely several years ago to get budwood and has not\r\nmade sufficient top yet to bear normal crops again. This is the original\r\ntree of Indiana. Beside the tree is the introducer, Mr. Mason J.\r\nNiblack, the gentleman with his hand by the tree. Now we come to the\r\noriginal Green River, one of the northern Kentucky pecans. It is in a\r\nforest more than twelve miles from Evansville across the Ohio River in\r\nKentucky. The trunk of that tree is typical of others in the forest.\r\nThere is a pecan forest of perhaps 200 acres, from which everything but\r\npecan timber was removed several years ago.\r\n\r\nThe slide before us shows the trunk of a supposed chance hybrid between\r\nhickory and pecan. The next slide shows a grafted tree of that variety.\r\nIt is interesting to note the vigor of this hybrid. It is quite the\r\nusual thing to get added vigor with hybrids. This is one of the most\r\nbeautiful, dense, dark green trees that I have ever seen in the hickory\r\nfamily. This tree is in northern Georgia, but it is not so prolific as\r\nthe parent tree.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Does the shell fill down there?\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: No, it does not.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: It grows very vigorously in Connecticut. It is a perfectly\r\nhardy hybrid, but I am afraid I shall only be able to use the crop for\r\nspectacle cases.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: This shows one of the most common methods of propagating the\r\npecan, the annular system. It is a slight modification of the system Mr.\r\nRush applies to the propagation of the walnut. This shows one of the\r\ntools designed especially for annular budding, the Galbraith knife. The\r\nrest of the operation you already understand. It is merely placing the\r\nbud in position and wrapping the same as Mr. Rush does.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: I would like to ask, does it make a great deal of\r\ndifference whether the bud ring is half an inch long or an inch and a\r\nquarter long?\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: It does not make any difference. The union takes place on the\r\ncambium layer. It is not made on the cut.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Then the length of the bud is not of great importance?\r\n\r\nMr. Rush: No, it is of no importance at all.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: This slide may be a little bit misleading. Two nuts matured in\r\nthe nursery on a scion that was inserted in February. The scion was\r\ntaken from a mature tree and the fruit buds had already set and had\r\nenough nourishment to carry them through the season so that they\r\nmatured. That is no indication of what may be expected in the way of\r\nbearing. It is one of the freaks. This is merely a view of a\r\nfourteen-year old pecan orchard in south-western Georgia, a 700-acre\r\norchard owned largely by one person. That is the orchard belonging to\r\nMr. G. M. Bacon, a name probably familiar to some of you. Those trees\r\nare set 46 feet, 8 inches apart, each way. There are twenty trees to the\r\nacre, just beginning to bear now. That photograph was taken some two\r\nyears ago showing the first step in topworking. The top has been\r\nremoved, as you notice, and the next slide shows the subsequent\r\nwater-sprouts which are later budded. The lower branches were left in\r\nthe first place to take up the sap while the new head was in formation.\r\nThey have now been removed. Our next point might be brought out in\r\nconnection with this slide. One of the typical, sub-tropical storms, not\r\nunusual in the Gulf States, swept over this area in September, just as\r\nthe nuts were beginning to mature and defoliated the trees and whipped\r\noff the nuts. The sap was still in circulation, and the varieties that\r\nrespond most readily to warm weather, that start earliest in the spring,\r\nsent out new leaves, so that foliage was foliage that ought to have come\r\non the next year, that is, it was exhausting next year's buds. The same\r\nyear the tree sent out its blossom buds, so it had no fruit the\r\nfollowing season. This slide shows one of the pests in the pecan\r\norchard, the twig girdler, at work. The insect deposits its egg under\r\nthe bark up at about that point, then goes down below girdles the twig,\r\nand it breaks off, goes to the ground, and the insect comes out, goes\r\ninto the ground and comes out the next season. There are a good many\r\ndrawbacks that are occurring and more are to be expected the same as\r\nwith other fruit. There are probably no more setbacks to pecan growing\r\nthan there are to the growing of other fruit, but this is one of the\r\nthings. This orchard was set in land bordering the Flint River and at\r\nthe time this picture was taken the water stood at the depth of three\r\nfeet. It probably did no harm, because it didn't stay more than a week\r\nor ten days. Sometimes it stays longer and in such cases it is a serious\r\nmatter. In Texas, floods come up like that into the branches of the\r\ntrees, so high in some seasons after the nuts are formed, that the nuts\r\ndeteriorate and fall to the ground. In such cases it is a pretty serious\r\nthing. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe time for which the \"scenic\" was engaged having expired, the\r\ndelegates returned to the Court House and the regular program was\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: We will next hear from Mr. Lake.\r\n\r\nMr. Lake: My topic, aside from the slides, was concerning the result of\r\nthe work at Arlington this year. It is all written out but I don't\r\npropose to read the paper at this stage. I have not been a teacher and\r\nlecturer for 25 years for nothing, and I don't propose to kill the few\r\nfriends I have among nut growers by talking them to death when they are\r\nhungry and want to see something interesting. I will send this paper in\r\ndue time to the secretary, and give way now to Mr. Jones. I did want to\r\nshow you on the slides a few illustrations of cross fertilization\r\nbetween the Japanese and the American walnut, but we will put those in\r\nengravings and put them in the Northern Nut Growers' Journal, so that\r\nyou will see them there with better satisfaction. Now one or two words\r\nabout these Persian walnuts. These are eastern grown seedlings, the best\r\nthat I have been able to pick out. Here is an Oregon grown nut. That is\r\nthe ideal type for dessert walnuts. This is the Meylan. There is only\r\none better, and that is the real Mayette, of which we grow very few in\r\nthe United States, but we are growing considerable of the Meylan.\r\nWhether we can grow this successfully here or not, I am not certain, but\r\nit is well worth trying. The better type of our nut seedlings in the\r\neast are from the Parisienne. We must get a nut something like this that\r\nyou can crack between your fingers, not one that is sealed so hard that\r\nit requires a hammer, and must get one with a very good quality of meat.\r\nOne great advantage to the walnut grower in the East will be that he can\r\nget his crop on to the Thanksgiving market, which is the cream of the\r\nmarket--something the Western or European nut grower cannot do. So if we\r\ncan grow a nut reasonably fair in quality we can expect excellent\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Mr. Jones, will you give us your points now?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: Dr. Deming yesterday asked me to give a little demonstration\r\nof grafting and I have brought along a sort of transplanted nursery on a\r\nboard, so that I might do so.\r\n\r\n(Here Mr. Jones demonstrated methods of grafting the pecan.)\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Tell us about the wax cloth, Mr. Jones.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: We use that over the cut.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: How do you make your wax cloth?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: We take a roll of this, possibly three or four yards long,\r\nvery thin muslin, roll it up and drop it in the melted wax.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: How do you make that wax?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: We don't measure the ingredients, but I think it varies from\r\nfour to six pound of rosin, to one pound of beeswax and a tea cup full\r\nof boiled linseed oil and about a tablespoon of lamp black.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: What do you use the lamp black for, Mr. Jones?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: To toughen the wax so that it will not crack and so that it\r\nwill adhere better.\r\n\r\nA Member: How do you get your excess of wax off the cloth?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: We just throw the rolls on a board and press them.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed: I believe you would find it easier to tear it up into strips\r\nthan to put it in rolls. We have been using that method. We ran short of\r\ncloth and I went to town and got some and tore off a piece about 8 or 9\r\nyards long and folded it up into strips that wide and dipped it in the\r\npure beeswax and pressed it on a board and it was ready for work.\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: I take just a common corn cob and wind it on as you would on\r\na spool, then, while the wax is warm, I dip it in; you can have the\r\ncloth half an inch wide or an inch wide just as you please. My way of\r\nmaking wax is, I take two pounds of rosin, one pound of beeswax and half\r\na pound of tallow. I find that stands all kinds of weather.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: You prefer the tallow?\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: Yes sir, I do.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Beef tallow or mutton tallow?\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: I prefer mutton tallow; two pounds of rosin, one of beeswax\r\nand half a pound of tallow. Then you want to boil it very slowly and\r\nthoroughly, and pour it in cold water.\r\n\r\nA Member: Do you unroll this roll of cloth?\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: I have a machine to turn it on just the same as you would on\r\na spool.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: The strip goes through the wax?\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: No, you wind that, then when your wax is warm, you drop this\r\nin but secure the ends, then take it out and lay it by till it's all\r\nsaturated; then I tear it off as I use it. I find that is the most\r\nconvenient thing, and I generally get calico, that is pretty closely\r\nwoven, but is rotten so that it tears easily.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: Did you ever use raffia for tying your grafts?\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: No sir, I have not.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: We have used it on pecans and walnuts for the reason that it\r\ndoesn't have to be untied as it bursts off with the growth of the tree.\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: This wax I have tried on thousands and thousands of grafts\r\nand it stands all kinds of weather. You can get wax that's been there 8\r\nor 10 years and you can take it off now and use it.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: That is one advantage of using the tallow; linseed oil will\r\ndry out.\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: Tallow is the best; that's been my experience.\r\n\r\nA Member: If linseed oil is not used immediately or very soon, it gets\r\nhard.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: It's all right in wax and all right in cloth, too, if you\r\nkeep it in a damp place till ready to use.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutt: Can you use parafine in place of beeswax?\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Have you tried this method on the other hickories besides\r\nthe pecans?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: Yes sir.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: You've got shagbark to catch fairly well, have you by this\r\nmethod?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: Yes sir.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary: How did your pecans and hickories do last summer?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: I've forgotten the exact percentage that grew. Some died\r\nafter they had made a growth of several inches. I think I left too many\r\nlimbs growing on the hickories. Some of them made quite good growth.\r\n\r\nA Member: When is this kind of grafting done?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: We wait until the sap is up.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: What do you cover the top with?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: With wax. We leave this open at the bottom, for the reason\r\nthat the sap can get out and not ferment. If it holds the sap, it will\r\nsour you know.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: How far down does your wax go, Mr. Jones?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: Far enough to cover up the wrapping.\r\n\r\nA Member: Does that work on pecans as well as hickories?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: Yes sir. To show the value of this patch, we have grafted\r\nrows side by side and got 80 per cent where we used this patch and 34\r\nper cent where we waxed it over solid and left no ventilation or exit\r\nfor the sap.\r\n\r\nA Member: Isn't that to keep the wax out of the cambium layer?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: Yes sir, it does that too.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: Are there any fine points about this trimming, other than\r\nmere wedge?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: No sir, only it's thick on one side, as you will see so that\r\nit wedges tightly.\r\n\r\nA Member: Isn't it a fact that you can use three and four year pecan\r\nwood just as well?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: Yes sir, two year wood or three will give you better results\r\nthan one year.\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: What time in the season do you graft?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: The 20th of April to the 20th of May here.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: What stage of stock do you prefer?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: Well it doesn't matter, you can graft these after they have\r\nmade a foot of new growth, if you've got a good dormant scion; you could\r\nput in a graft any time in the summer, perhaps.\r\n\r\nA Member: How long do you leave on the paper bags?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: Until the scion begins to grow. Sometimes I have made a\r\nmistake and left them on until they grew up and curled down.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: What is the superiority of that over plain cleft grafting?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: You can do better work and do it quicker. I have put in 1200\r\ngrafts in a day.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: You don't mind this arch being left up?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: That ought to go a little deeper, maybe, but it don't make\r\nmuch difference, so long as it is well waxed.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: The paper bag protects the scion?\r\n\r\nMr Jones: Yes sir. The object is not to protect the scion so much as to\r\nkeep it dry. You want to keep the scion dry until it gets sap from the\r\nstock to start it into growth.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: Is it necessary that this should be waxed cloth?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: No sir, we use paper ordinarily, of course we run wax over\r\nthe paper in waxing the scion and then the paper is as good as cloth.\r\n\r\nCol. Sober: Do you find it apt to curl up in windy days--the paper? I\r\ntried that and had all kinds of trouble until I got on to the tape.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: We don't try to tie with the paper; the paper is only to let\r\nthe surplus moisture or sap out.\r\n\r\nA Member: Does this tend to hold that in or is it all held in by the\r\npatch there?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: This doesn't really need any tying, as it is large.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: Would you carry the patch around to the other side?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: No sir, just fill it up with wax.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: And the juice runs out of there and will escape anyway.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: Yes sir.\r\n\r\nA Member: Do you wax in addition to the paper you put on?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: We don't wax the scion all over. We used to take hot wax and\r\nrun a thin layer over the whole scion, but we quit that and used the\r\nbag, because if you wax over a scion tight and it happens to have\r\nsufficient moisture, it will start growth with that moisture before it\r\nmakes the union.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: Do you wax the tip end?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: Yes sir.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: Do you wax this in here?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: Yes sir; we fill that over with liquid wax. It is possible to\r\nhave your wax too hot, and burn the scion.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: Have you found that all the species of hickory take grafts\r\nwith equal ease?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: We grafted some here last spring that started very nicely and\r\nthen died. I don't know whether it was in the hickory stock or whether\r\nthey were robbed by the sprouts; we didn't pull off any sprouts. There's\r\na whole lot of things we don't know about grafting yet, but will know\r\nmore in time.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: How about using scion wood more than one year old?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: We prefer two or three year old wood for the scion. We have\r\ncoming now, 3,000 walnut scions from California and they are all to be\r\ntwo and three years old. I have put in rows of 100 with large two year\r\nscions and you could count 100 and not find one dead among them and some\r\nof the scions were almost as big as my wrist. It's a job to cut them.\r\nYou see that scion, being large, has enough vitality to hold it until it\r\ncan make a union.\r\n\r\nA Member: You want one bud on this?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: We generally have two buds.\r\n\r\nA Member: Do you use the same method on the Persian walnut?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: Yes sir; we got a little stingy one year and cut these all to\r\none bud and hardly got any out of them. You've got to have wood enough\r\nto hold the scions dormant; of course there may be one or more buds on\r\nthe scion.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: And got to have food enough in them.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: Yes sir. Col. Sober grafts chestnuts that way, but I have\r\nnever been able to graft pecans and walnuts with very short scions.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman: I have caught chestnuts with one bud, but most of the nut\r\ntrees want more food and you've got to have a lot in the scion.\r\n\r\nProf. Smith: Have you used that with pecans in the North?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones: Yes sir, this will be our method of propagation.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Jones had given further illustrations of the process of\r\ngrafting, the convention adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME PERSIAN WALNUT OBSERVATIONS, EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS FOR 1912\r\n\r\nE. R. LAKE, WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Arlington work for 1912 in the propagation of the Persian walnut\r\nconsisted in top-grafting three and four year old nursery stock by\r\nseveral methods, as ordinary cleft, side cleft, bark cleft, prong, whip\r\nand modified forms of these. For wrapping we tried bicycle tape, waxed\r\ncord and cloth, with wax and plasticine for covering.\r\n\r\nThe work was done during the latter part of April and first part of May.\r\nThe stocks averaged from 3/4 to 1-1/4 inches diameter, and were cut off\r\nfrom 16 to 30 inches above the surface of the ground. In a few cases\r\nbark grafting by modified whip form was performed upon the branches at a\r\nheight of about 4 feet.\r\n\r\nLater in the season from June 12th to August 25th buds were placed by\r\nvarying methods. In the earlier instances the buds were taken from\r\nleft-over grafting stock. Of the scion wood received last year all the\r\nwood from Eastern growers was frost bitten and wholly failed to take\r\nwith one or two exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific Coast wood was received in excellent condition and\r\noperations with it were gratifying, especially with the ordinary cleft\r\ngraft, and patch bud.\r\n\r\nNext year's work in grafting will be confined to the cleft, and the\r\nbark-whip processes. This latter is very simple and under careful\r\ntreatment promises to be a convenient and successful process.\r\n\r\nIn the budding operations we resorted to a number of methods largely for\r\nthe benefit of the information obtained from the practice, and not so\r\nmuch for the returns in propagated trees.\r\n\r\nHowever, for 1913 in the work of propagating for stock results we shall\r\nconfine our practice to the patch method, though we may find from later\r\ntests that the hinge method so favorably looked upon by Oregon is better\r\nsuited to the work.\r\n\r\nVarious experiments with tying material were tried. Raffia, cotton cord,\r\nwaxed cloth and bicycle tape were used. The raffia and cord gave best\r\nresults. A tight tie is needed.\r\n\r\nJune-budding from the left-over graft-wood gave a very low percentage of\r\n\"takes.\" Most of the buds appeared to be drowned. Buds from the current\r\nyear's growth inserted from early to middle of August are at present\r\napparently in good dormant condition.\r\n\r\nSome July buds from the left-over graft-wood placed in the younger\r\nbranches of a twelve year old American black took well and made from\r\nthree to six inches growth. The branches were cut back as soon as the\r\nbuds appeared to be set, a course that would not be advocated if one\r\nwere doing the work for re-topping. The young wood from these buds is\r\ndelicate and soft and in order to insure their living through the\r\nwinter, so far as our efforts may avail, they have been enclosed in\r\nstrong paper bags. In our budding and grafting operations we had no\r\nsuccess with the Japanese or Chinese stocks. We expect to try them\r\nfurther as their rapid growth makes them much to be desired if a\r\npermanent union can be effected. So far as we have been able to learn\r\nfrom the southern propagators who have worked along this line, no\r\ndifficulty has been encountered in effecting a short-life union,--four\r\nto six years on an average, though a few have kept alive for twelve\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the successful grafts has been very variable. In several\r\ninstances in which both scions upon a stock grew, the growth was from\r\ntwo to three feet. In other cases the young wood was scarcely a foot\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the stocks and scion-wood varied widely in size and vigor\r\nand the further fact that the scions were from several varieties of\r\nwestern stock are quite sufficient causes for no uniform results in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nThe wood of all successful grafts appears to be in excellent condition\r\nfor the winter season and we are looking forward to an interesting\r\nfurther growth of these next year, though the trees have just been\r\ntransplanted. In order to doubly insure ourselves against loss of the\r\nvarieties now growing one half, or even more in a few instances, of the\r\nyoung wood has been removed and placed in a cold room so that further\r\ngrafting or budding of these varieties may be made next year.\r\n\r\nNursery trees of the Franquette, Pomeroy, Parisienne and unidentified\r\nothers, on their own roots are making a pitiable effort at successful\r\ngrowth, while all wood on the black stock is making excellent growth.\r\n\r\nIn one instance the wood of Mayquette a cross between Mayette and\r\nFranquette formed two nutlets. Lack of pollen was all that prevented the\r\nfruiting of one-year-old grafted trees. A splendid point for the unit\r\norchard booster, but a point of no value to the real walnut grower.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSS FERTILIZATION\r\n\r\nOwing to the very vigorous weather of the past winter the catkins on the\r\nolder Persians at Arlington Farm were killed. In order to study the\r\nconduct and product of these trees we sought pollen elsewhere to\r\nfertilize their liberal display of pistils. We were successful in\r\nobtaining some from the trees of Messrs. Killen and Rosa, and Miss Lea,\r\nbut though this and some pollen of black, butternut and the Japanese was\r\nused no pollenation was successful.\r\n\r\nIn the case of sieboldiana, however, we succeeded in securing what\r\nappears to be fruit of certain definite cross-fertilization, as\r\nsieboldiana x nigra; sieboldiana x cinerea and possibly sieboldiana x\r\nregia.\r\n\r\nOnly in one instance did the nuts appear to have other than the usual\r\ncharacters of sieboldiana.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the cinerea cross were longer, more tubular and somewhat\r\ndeeper furrowed and darker.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately some conflicting results in the fruiting of the\r\nsieboldiana places the possible cross-fruits under a cloud.\r\n\r\nA peculiarity of the blossoming of the sieboldiana at Arlington this\r\nyear was that the stamens and pistils of an individual tree opened at\r\ndates of six to ten days apart, and with the tree used for crossing the\r\ncatkins were all off before the pistils opened. As no two trees are near\r\ntogether, perhaps two to three hundred feet being the closest,\r\nnatural cross-pollenating was not expected. However, after the\r\ncross-pollenations by hand were made and fruits set, and even matured,\r\nit was found that some clusters had from one to three more nuts than\r\nwere hand treated. Many of the clusters had less nuts than the number of\r\npistils treated, which was to be expected.\r\n\r\nBut how to account for the extra sets is a problem not clear for it is\r\npossible that pollenation might have occurred in one of two ways--by\r\nstray pollen grains from the hand operations by wind-carried grains from\r\nthe trees. In any event only the fruiting of the trees from the nuts\r\nunder consideration will settle it, and as these have been planted we\r\nare on the way to the solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDIANA PECANS\r\n\r\nR. L. MCCOY, INDIANA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pecan is probably the best nut that grows. It belongs to the hickory\r\nfamily which is indigenous to North America. Since water is its natural\r\ndistributing agent it is most generally found growing intermixed with\r\nthe large hickory nut or shagbark in creek and river bottoms. While the\r\nhickory is hardy enough to thrive even into the Canadian provinces the\r\npecan is not so hardy and is seldom found in the northern tier of\r\nstates. It thrives well as far north as the northern boundary of\r\nIllinois. The writer has seen a transplanted tree in bearing in Branch\r\nCounty, Michigan, and native trees along the Mississippi River near the\r\nmouth of the Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nThe nuts in the extreme northern limit are not much larger than a hazel\r\nnut. But the nuts that grow in Indiana and Illinois from the Ohio River\r\non the south to Rock Island on the northwest and Lafayette on the\r\nnortheast are much larger. Here are found many superior nuts worthy of\r\npropagation. In fact, the writer has before him a great many nuts of\r\nnamed and un-named varieties which he and Mr. Littlepage and others have\r\ndiscovered in their search for worthy nuts in the native pecan woods.\r\nThere are many thousand acres of these groves on the Ohio, Green, Wabash\r\nand Illinois rivers where many trees are found which bear nuts as large\r\nas some of the varieties which are being propagated in the Gulf Coast\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the Evansville group are especially noted for their fine\r\nflavor. The people of this section will not eat southern pecans if they\r\ncan get native nuts. This year several carloads of these native wild\r\nnuts will be shipped to the Cleveland, Boston, and New York markets.\r\nWhile the finer nuts seldom get into the markets at all but are bought\r\nby wealthy men in the locality where they grow. Many men buy from a\r\nspecial tree year after year--its flavor suiting their taste.\r\n\r\nThe yield from some of these larger trees (and there are many of them\r\nfour feet in diameter and some as large as nineteen feet four inches in\r\ncircumference at shoulder height) is very good. The writer has seen a\r\nnumber in the last few days which were estimated to have from four to\r\nsix hundred pounds, the most of the crop having not yet been gathered.\r\nHe knows of one tree which bore (17) seventeen bushels and Mr. Louis\r\nHuber of Shawneetown gathered 718 pounds from another tree. Two hundred\r\nand eighty-five pounds of nuts were gathered and weighted from the Luce\r\ntree. These nuts were gathered green for fear of their being stolen and\r\nit was estimated that fifteen pounds were left on the tree. Also that\r\nthe hail storm in early September destroyed fifty (50) pounds more.\r\nHence the Luce bore approximately eight bushels. The Kentucky tree had\r\nfour and one-half bushels by measurement. The Warrick tree had, the best\r\nwe can estimate, about 150 pounds. The Grayville, or Posey as Mr.\r\nLittlepage wishes to call it, bore at least two hundred pounds by\r\nweight. One hundred and sixty pounds were gathered from the Major and\r\ntwo hundred and fifty pounds from the Green River tree. We do not think\r\nthe Hinton bore to exceed two pounds of nuts. We do not know the amount\r\nof nuts gathered from the Indiana and the Busseron trees. The Buttrick\r\ntree had some three or four bushels of nuts this year but as a dredge\r\nditch was recently constructed by it, destroying half of its root\r\nsystem, it did not mature its crop. This tree has been in bearing since\r\n1817 and it has not been known to miss a crop previous to this year.\r\n\r\nIn our search for nuts worthy of being propagated we have found several\r\nnuts as yet un-named that are in our opinion much superior to any\r\nnorthern nut that has been brought to public notice. But as we know\r\nlittle of their bearing record and do not wish to burden the nurserymen\r\nwith too many varieties we will keep these trees under observation for a\r\nyear or two before naming them.\r\n\r\nWe have been trying to propagate some of the best varieties at our\r\nnursery for about three years. Our first attempt was root-grafting in\r\nwhich our success varied from 15 per cent to 75 per cent under the best\r\nconditions. We found after some experience that it was not difficult to\r\nroot-graft. But last winter, 1911-12, was the coldest winter for some\r\nyears, the thermometer registering as low as 20 degrees below. Most of\r\nour root-grafts were killed back to the ground but few if any of them\r\nwere killed outright. When spring came they started new growth and are\r\nnow about four feet high. The fall of 1911 was very warm and wet and\r\nthey were in vigorous growth until the first week in November when we\r\nhad a hard freeze which killed the wheat, causing the worst failure in\r\nthat crop ever known in this section. The winter then following being\r\nvery cold we had two conditions against spring root-grafted pecans. But\r\nwe failed to see any budded ones that were injured. However, we only had\r\npecans budded to hickory which was done by Mr. Paul White in May, 1911\r\nand, so far as we know, this was the first hickory top-worked to pecan\r\nin Indiana. However, he now has quite a number top-worked last spring\r\nthat have made a growth of three or four feet. We also have both budded\r\nand root-grafted pecans from last spring and summer so that in the\r\nspring we will have a better opportunity to see what effect the winter\r\nwill have on them.\r\n\r\nSo far as we are able to determine from our observation of a few\r\norchards all pecan trees bought from southern nurserymen and planted in\r\nthis section have either died out or made very feeble growth. Although\r\nsome large Texas nuts have been planted here and grown, yet they have\r\neither not fruited at all or the nuts have proved no better than our\r\nnative nuts.\r\n\r\nThe northern pecan timber is not brash like the southern pecan but is\r\nvery elastic and tough. An axe-handle made from northern pecan sells for\r\nten cents more than one made from hickory and pecan timber is much\r\nsought after by axe-handle makers.\r\n\r\nThe people in this section have in the last few years awakened to the\r\nfact that their swamps studded with pecan trees are about the most\r\nvaluable lands they possess and many are the inquiries: \"Where can we\r\nget good budded or grafted pecans?\"\r\n\r\nThe idea of propagating the northern pecan is of very recent origin and\r\nwhile the few attempts at propagation have not as yet met with any very\r\ngreat success, yet we are hoping that the time will be when many acres\r\nof our lands shall be set in valuable pecan orchards and our highways\r\nlined with long rows of fine pecans, chestnuts, and English walnuts\r\nwhich shall serve the three-fold purpose of beautifying Mother Earth,\r\nyielding delicious food, and furnishing a place of rest for the weary\r\ntraveler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nREPORT OF THE SECRETARY AND TREASURER\r\n\r\n  Bal. on hand, date of last report                 $ 48.73\r\n  Annual dues and life membership                    178.00\r\n  Advertisements in Annual Report                     25.00\r\n  Sale of report                                      18.00\r\n  Dr. Crocker, paid for list of names                  2.00\r\n  Prof. Collins, paid for reprints                     8.00\r\n                                                   ________\r\n\r\n  Total receipts                                    $279.73\r\n\r\n  Expenses:\r\n\r\n  Expenses of Prof. Collins               $ 20.85\r\n  Printing report and reprints             195.16\r\n  Other printing                            38.00\r\n  Postage                                   35.75\r\n  Typewriting                               16.24\r\n  Stationery                                 4.50\r\n  Miscellaneous                             14.30\r\n                                          _______\r\n\r\n  Total expenses                          $324.80\r\n\r\n  Bill receivable                                      1.00\r\n  Bill payable                              22.00\r\n                                          _______   _______\r\n                                          $346.80   $280.73\r\n  Deficit                                                    $66.07\r\n\r\n     Our first annual report, embodying the transactions at the first\r\n     and second annual meetings, was issued in May, and copies were sent\r\n     to all members, to the principal libraries of the country, to\r\n     officials of the Agricultural Department at Washington, and to some\r\n     state agricultural officials, to several agricultural and other\r\n     periodicals for notice and review, and to various persons\r\n     especially interested.

That we extend our thanks to the Mayor and citizens of Lancaster for\r\nthe welcome and entertainment they have afforded us while here and for\r\nthe excellent auditorium they have placed at our disposal.\r\n\r\n2. That we extend our thanks to Messrs. Rush and Jones and their\r\nentertainment committee.\r\n\r\n3. That we extend our thanks to the Pennsylvania Chestnut Tree Blight\r\nCommission for the attendance of their representatives. We note with\r\nkeen interest their expressions of hope for the control of this\r\ncyclopean menace.\r\n\r\n4. That we express our deep appreciation of the great interest and\r\nvaluable services of Dr. Morris, the retiring President, and Dr. Deming,\r\nthe Secretary and Treasurer, two officers to whose untiring efforts this\r\nAssociation is largely due.\r\n\r\n5. That we express the thanks of the Association to those members and\r\nothers who have enriched this meeting by their interesting exhibits.\r\n\r\n6. That the following letter be sent from this Association to the,--\r\n\r\n  Secretary of Agriculture,\r\n  Persons in authority in the United States Bureau of Plant Industry,\r\n  The Presidents of Agricultural Colleges,\r\n  The Directors of Agricultural Experiment Stations,\r\n  And leading Teachers in Agriculture Colleges.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Nut Growers' Association, by resolution passed at its third\r\nannual meeting, held at Lancaster, Pa., in December 1912, calls your\r\nattention to the importance of, and need for, the breeding of new types\r\nof crop yielding trees. We now have the possibility of a new, but as yet\r\nlittle developed, agriculture which may (A) nearly double our food\r\nsupply and also (B) serve as the greatest factor in the conservation of\r\nour resources.\r\n\r\n(A) Our agriculture at the present time depends chiefly upon the grains\r\nwhich were improved by selection in pre-historic times, because they\r\nwere annuals and quick yielders. The heavy yielding plants, the engines\r\nof nature, are the trees, which have in most cases remained unimproved\r\nand largely unused until the present time because of the slowness of\r\ntheir generations and the absence of knowledge concerning plant\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\nWe now know something about plant breeding, and its possibilities as\r\napplied to the crop yielding trees seem to be enormous. They certainly\r\nwarrant immediate and widespread effort at plant breeding. A member of\r\nthis Association has shown that the chinquapin can be crossed with the\r\noak; that all the walnuts freely hybridize with each other and with the\r\nopen bud hickories, a class which includes the toothsome and profitable\r\npecan. There is in California a tree which is considered to be a cross\r\nbetween the native walnut and the live oak. The Mendelian Law in\r\nconnection with past achievements in plant breeding, and the experiments\r\nof Loeb in crossing the sea urchin and the star fish are profoundly\r\nsuggestive.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of plant breeding as applied to crop yielding trees\r\nseem to be enormous. They certainly warrant immediate and widespread\r\neffort toward the creation of useful strains which may become the basis\r\nof a new agriculture yielding food for both man and the domestic\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n(B) The time for constructive conservation has come. Our most vital\r\nresource is the soil. It is possibly the only resource for which there\r\nis no substitute. Its destruction is the most irreparable waste. So long\r\nas the earth remains in place the burnt forest may return and the\r\nexhausted field may be restored by scientific agriculture. But once the\r\ngully removes this soil, it is the end so far as our civilization is\r\nconcerned--forest, field and food are impossible and even water power is\r\ngreatly impaired. Our present system of agriculture, depending upon the\r\ngrains, demands the plowing of hillsides and the hillsides wash away.\r\nThis present dependence upon the plow means that one-third of our soil\r\nresources is used only for forest, one-third is being injured by\r\nhillside erosion, and only one-third, the levelest, is being properly\r\nused for plow crops.\r\n\r\nThe present alternative of Forestry for hillsides is often impossible\r\nbecause the yields are too meagre. Almost any land that can produce a\r\nforest, and much that has been considered too dry for forest, can\r\nproduce an annual harvest of value to man or his animals when we have\r\ndevoted sufficient attention to the breeding of walnuts, chestnuts,\r\npecans, shellbarks, acorn yielding oaks, beech nuts, pine nuts, hazel\r\nnuts, almonds, honey locust, mesquite, screw bean, carob, mulberry,\r\npersimmon, pawpaw, and many other fruit and nut trees of this and other\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nThe slowness and expense of the process of plant introduction and tree\r\nbreeding limits this work to a few individuals with patience and\r\nscientific tastes and to governmental and other institutions of a\r\npermanent nature. The United States Government and each state experiment\r\nstation should push this work vigorously and we appeal to you to use\r\nyour influence in that direction. You may find material of interest in\r\nour published proceedings and in the Fruit and Nut Journal, the organ of\r\nthe industry, published at Petersburg, Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF COMMITTEE\r\n\r\nON THE DEATH OF PROFESSOR JOHN CRAIG\r\n\r\nRead by Dr. Morris\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Northern Nut Growers' Association suffered very great loss in the\r\ndeath of Professor John Craig, at Siasconset, Massachusetts, on August\r\n10, 1912.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Craig, from his many responsible positions in the\r\nhorticultural world, had acquired a wealth of information which was\r\nalways at the disposal of his friends and students. His training as a\r\nteacher gave such facility in expression of view, that his part in our\r\ndiscussions inspired the audience and called forth the best that others\r\nhad to offer.\r\n\r\n\"His type of mind was essentially scientific, and combined with this\r\ntype of mind there was a rare quality of critical faculty in relation to\r\nthe relative practical values of horticultural ideas and methods. His\r\ninterest in the Northern Nut Growers Association belonged to a natural\r\nfondness for everything that promised new development, and he\r\nestablished at Cornell University the first course in nuciculture,--so\r\nfar as we are aware,--that has ever been formulated at an educational\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\n\"The personality of Professor Craig, characteristic of that of the\r\nscientist, was marked by simplicity and directness of manner, impatience\r\nwith error due to carelessness or intent, but unlimited benign tolerance\r\nof all men who honestly expressed views opposing his own or who made\r\nconscientious mistakes. Professor Craig possessed that broad humanity\r\nwhich found quite as large interest in his fellow man as it found in his\r\nspecial study of plants, and his charming personality, strong manly\r\nbearing, scholarship, and active interest in whatever engaged his\r\nattention at all, will be ever remembered by those of us who had the\r\npleasure and the profit of his acquaintance.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Littlepage: I would just like to say, in connection with the very\r\nappropriate and excellent words which the President used in reference to\r\nProf. Craig, that it certainly meets the most hearty approval of all of\r\nus who knew Prof. Craig, that this association go on record in this\r\nmanner. At the first meeting that was held, by the few of us who met in\r\nBronx Park Museum at New York, to start this organization, you will\r\nremember the enthusiasm and the words of encouragement that Prof. Craig\r\ngave us at that time. He was there among the first and there was always\r\nintermingled with the scientific phase of the subjects that he\r\ndiscussed, the practical, genial good fellowship that made everyone like\r\nhim; and after all, it is but proper that we stop for a moment and\r\nexpress our deep appreciation. In this life of turmoil and business\r\nhustle, I think that we sometimes do not quite realize the shortness of\r\nlife, the shortness of the time that we have to accomplish any of those\r\nthings in which we are interested; and it is the men who are giving\r\ntheir time to these scientific subjects, the results of which will inure\r\nto all humanity, who are certainly entitled to consideration and a\r\nkindly remembrance. That is why it was that I heard with such\r\ngratification the words of the President about Prof. Craig.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF COMMITTEE ON EXHIBITS\r\n\r\nRead by Professor Hutt\r\n\r\nBy J.

W. Merkel, Forester, New York Zoological Park; representing Bronx,\r\n    Valley Parkway Commission.\r\n\r\n  Dr. W. A. Murrill, Acting Director, New York Botanical Garden.\r\n\r\n  J. J.

Parrott, Entomologist, State Experiment Station, Geneva.\r\n\r\n  F. C. Stewart, Botanist, State Experiment Station, Geneva.\r\n\r\nAfter a prolonged discussion the following resolution was unanimously\r\nadopted:\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, the hickory bark borer is at present extremely injurious and\r\ndestructive to hickory trees in and around New York City, and has\r\nalready destroyed and is threatening the destruction of thousands of\r\nvaluable trees; and\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, it has been demonstrated in several instances, on a large\r\nscale, that the hickory bark borer can be practically controlled;\r\ntherefore, be it RESOLVED, that we hereby respectfully request the\r\ncommissioner of agriculture to take such steps as may be necessary to\r\nbring about the enforcement of the provisions of the agricultural law\r\nrelative to insect pests and diseases with particular reference to\r\ncontrol of the hickory bark borer; and be it further\r\n\r\nRESOLVED, that the thanks of the conference are hereby tendered to\r\nCommissioner of Agriculture Huson for his courtesies and the calling of\r\nthe conference.\r\n\r\nThe following \"News Items\" of no date, but received in the early part of\r\nJune, shows what action has so far been taken:\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nNews Items\r\n\r\nCommissioner Huson of the State Department of Agriculture is receiving\r\nconsiderable information relative to a serious outbreak of the hickory\r\nbark borer in the vicinity of New York and on Long Island. This borer is\r\nthe principal cause of the death of thousands of hickory trees. The\r\ngreatest infested area is in the northern part of New York City, in\r\nWestchester County, in Queens and Nassau Counties, though much injury\r\nhas been observed throughout Suffolk County, particularly along the\r\nnorthern shore of the island. The area of infested hickories is about\r\nthe same as the territory where the chestnut trees have succumbed to the\r\nattacks of the chestnut bark disease. Now that the chestnuts have so\r\nnearly disappeared and the fact that the hickory trees are also\r\nthreatened with entire extermination because of the hickory borer,\r\nrequests have been made by many citizens, that the Commissioner of\r\nAgriculture should exercise such authority as the law gives him in the\r\ncontrol of this pest. That the hickory trees that have not been attacked\r\nmay be saved, or in a very large measure protected has been proven in\r\nthe Zoological Park and in the parks of Brooklyn. The able\r\nsuperintendents of these two parks have for the last two or three years,\r\nbeen cutting out every infested hickory tree and in that way the other\r\ntrees are found at this time to be free from insects and they have been\r\nsaved from certain destruction.\r\n\r\nThe hickory borer eats its way into the bark of the hickory trees in\r\nmid-summer. Eggs are laid which hatch and the grubs feed in peculiar\r\ngalleries in the bark and between the wood and the bark is such a way as\r\nto cut off the flow of the sap, thus causing the death of the trees.\r\nThese grubs are in these galleries at this time of the year and will\r\nremain so until about the middle of June. It is, therefore, necessary\r\nthat the infested trees be cut and destroyed before that time in order\r\nto prevent further widespread of the insects. The Commissioner has been\r\npromised the hearty cooperation of many influential and interested\r\ncitizens in this movement and agents of this Department are on the\r\nground with authority to inspect trees to ascertain the limit of\r\ninfestation and they have been directed to mark such trees as should be\r\nremoved and destroyed at once.\r\n\r\nAll persons are requested to inform the Department of the location of\r\ninfested hickory trees and to extend to the inspectors such assistance\r\nas may be desired.\r\n\r\nDepartment Circular Number 64 on \"Dying Hickory Trees\" will be sent to\r\nall applicants.\r\n\r\n                                                     CALVIN J.

At one time we had under test about 15 distinct varieties. After\r\nseveral years tests they all succumbed to the blight; a blight that\r\nattacked the old wood and killed it. Some of our bushes or trees got as\r\nmuch as six inches in diameter before they were entirely killed back.\r\nPossibly by thorough spraying from the setting of trees a success might\r\nbe made. Some varieties tested were very prolific and of fine quality.\r\nWe succeeded in getting a fine lot of walnuts from the tree southeast of\r\nthe potato house by applying pollen. They are as fine and as well filled\r\nand as large as any I have ever seen. Several of our crosses had a few\r\nnuts this year, most of them are rather thick shelled. The trees though\r\nseem to be perfectly hardy. We have several Japan walnut trees bearing\r\nthis year some of which I consider first class, equal to the best\r\nshellbarks or pecans in cracking quality; besides they are so very\r\nprolific, producing as many as a dozen in a cluster. We can show\r\nspecimens from several distinct varieties or types. The Cordiformis\r\nseems to be one of the best. We also have some very fine black walnuts.\r\nOne of our seedlings from the select nuts produces the largest walnuts\r\nthat I have ever seen. The tree did not have very many on it this year.\r\nSeveral of the other seedlings from the same planting produced fine nuts\r\nwith good cracking qualities. We also had several pecan trees to bear a\r\nfew nuts this year; most of the nuts were rather small but of fine\r\nquality, very thin shells and well filled. Our Japan chestnuts bore\r\nquite full.\r\n\r\nI think it possible to produce Persian walnuts successfully in our\r\nlocality. I also think the Japan walnut offers a good field for\r\ninvestigation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE STATE VICE-PRESIDENT FOR COLORADO\r\n\r\nDec. 11, 1912.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can learn only two attempts have been made in this state to\r\ngrow nuts. The first one consists in the setting out of about one\r\nhundred Japanese walnuts by the Antlers Orchard Co. Their place is on\r\nthe western slope in the fruit district and I am informed that the first\r\nwinter the tops were killed but new shoots put out from the roots and\r\nthe trees did well this year.\r\n\r\nThe other attempt is one I made last spring. I set out a few pecan trees\r\nas an experiment near Colorado Springs. Six of the seven trees lived and\r\nput out some leaves but did not make much growth. If they survive the\r\nwinter I purpose planting more pecans and some other nuts,--chestnuts,\r\nblack walnuts and possibly Persian walnuts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                         Hilton, N. Y.\r\n                                                        Nov. 29, 1912.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nIn reply to your inquiry I am inclosing notes on walnut culture in this\r\nlocality. This noble fruit is not generally known here. I do not know of\r\nmore than twelve or fifteen bearing trees in my county. Of these all are\r\nwithout doubt seedlings, and are located in places where the peach will\r\nthrive. The soil in which they grow is varied: Dunkirk fine sand,\r\nDunkirk silt loam, Ontario fine sand loam, and Ontario loam. (See soil\r\nsurvey of _Monroe county_, N. Y. U. S. Dept. Agriculture.) The altitude\r\nis comparatively low. The highest point in the county is only 682 ft.\r\nabove lake Ontario, and the average elevation is not more than 300 ft.\r\nThe \"Holden\" walnuts are growing at a still lower level. This tree,\r\nconsidering its surroundings and location, had a good crop this year.\r\nStanding on the lawn uncultivated and unfertilized, hemmed in on three\r\nsides by other trees, it gave us at least three bushels of fine nuts.\r\n\r\nThe wood showed no injury after last winter's intense cold. Growth\r\nstarted in the spring just as the apple blossoms came out. The catkins\r\nare very large, at least much larger than those on the other trees we\r\nhave, and hang on longer. One of our trees loses its male blossoms\r\nbefore the female bloom appears, but the \"Holden\" is the last to lose\r\nthem. About half of the clusters of fruit have two or three nuts in\r\nthem. We began harvesting the nuts Sept. 15th, just four months from the\r\nblossom. The dropping continued for a month, prolonged on account of\r\nlack of frost.\r\n\r\nLast week the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported the appearance\r\nof the first load of English walnuts ever brought on the local market.\r\nThey were grown on fifteen year old seedlings, at East Avon, N. Y., by\r\nAdelbert Thompson. His orchard is said to contain 200 trees. It seems\r\nvery probable that the next twenty-five years will see the development\r\nof Persian walnut growing, to commercial proportions, in those\r\nlocalities in the state where the peach will grow.\r\n\r\nI had a little experience last spring with southern grown walnut trees.\r\nLast spring I received from Louisiana eleven trees of the \"Holden\"\r\nvariety grafted on black walnut stocks. They were fine trees, the\r\nlargest at least eight feet tall. Six of these I set out in my own\r\norchards and gave them intensive care and cultivation, but alas, growth\r\nwas weak and at last they died. If I were to deduce any conclusions it\r\nwould be that there is too great a difference between Louisiana and New\r\nYork conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE SECRETARY OF THE MINNESOTA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY\r\n\r\nDear Sir:--\r\n\r\nI am addressing you as secretary of the Northern Nut Growers'\r\nAssociation in hopes that you can refer me to some one, perhaps a member\r\nof your society, in this part of the country to whom we can appeal to\r\ntake part at the coming annual meeting of this society as champion of\r\nnut growing. While in our state we cannot successfully grow pecans, nor\r\nperhaps the sweet chestnut and some other nuts, yet some varieties do\r\nwell with us and a larger interest in their growing should be\r\nstimulated.\r\n\r\n                          Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                 A. W. Latham, Sec'y.",
