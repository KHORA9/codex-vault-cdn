The first is entitled _The\r\nSacred Beetle and Others_; the second and the third will be known as\r\n_The Life of the Weevil_ and _More Beetles_ respectively.\r\n\r\n_The Glow-worm_, which gives its name to the present book, did not\r\nform part of the _Souvenirs entomologiques_ as originally published.\r\nIt is one of two essays written specially, at my request, for\r\ntranslation into English, towards the close of Henri Fabre's life; in\r\nfact, this and _The Ant-lion_, a short essay for children, were the\r\nlast works that came from the veteran author's pen. _The Glow-worm_\r\nappeared first in the _Century Magazine_. Of the remaining chapters,\r\nseveral have appeared in various periodicals, notably the _English\r\nReview_ and in _Land and Water_, the editor and proprietors of which\r\nadmirable weekly have shown the most enlightened interest in Fabre's\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nA part of the chapter entitled _The Dung-beetles of the Pampas_\r\nfigures in Messrs. Adam & Charles Black's volume, _The Life and Love\r\nof the Insect_ (New York: the Macmillan Co.), translated by myself;\r\nand the chapters on the Capricorn and Burying-beetles will be found in\r\nMr. T. Fisher Unwin's volume, _The Wonders of Instinct_ (New York: the\r\nCentury Co.), translated by myself and Mr. Bernard Miall, which also\r\ncontains _The Glow-worm_. These chapters are included in the present\r\nedition by consent of and arrangement with the publishers named.\r\n\r\nLastly, Mr. Bernard Miall has earned my gratitude by the valuable\r\nassistance which he has given me in preparing the translation of the\r\ngreater part of this volume.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER TEIXEIRA DE MATTOS.\r\n\r\nCHELSEA, _5 September_, 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nTHE GLOW-WORM\r\n\r\n\r\nFew insects in our climes vie in popular fame with the Glow-worm, that\r\ncurious little animal which, to celebrate the little joys of life,\r\nkindles a beacon at its tail-end. Who does not know it, at least by\r\nname? Who has not seen it roam amid the grass, like a spark fallen\r\nfrom the moon at its full? The Greeks of old called it [Greek:\r\nlampouris], meaning, the bright-tailed. Science employs the same term:\r\nit calls the lantern-bearer, _Lampyris noctiluca_, LIN. In this case,\r\nthe common name is inferior to the scientific phrase, which, when\r\ntranslated, becomes both expressive and accurate.\r\n\r\nIn fact, we might easily cavil at the word \"worm.\" The Lampyris is not\r\na worm at all, not even in general appearance. He has six short legs,\r\nwhich he well knows how to use; he is a gad-about, a trot-about. In\r\nthe adult state, the male is correctly garbed in wing-cases, like the\r\ntrue Beetle that he is. The female is an ill-favoured thing who knows\r\nnaught of the delights of flying: all her life long, she retains the\r\nlarval shape, which, for the rest, is similar to that of the male, who\r\nhimself is imperfect so long as he has not achieved the maturity that\r\ncomes with pairing-time. Even in this initial stage, the word \"worm\"\r\nis out of place. We French have the expression \"Naked as a worm,\" to\r\npoint to the lack of any defensive covering. Now the Lampyris is\r\nclothed, that is to say, he wears an epidermis of some consistency;\r\nmoreover, he is rather richly coloured: his body is dark brown all\r\nover, set off with pale pink on the thorax, especially on the lower\r\nsurface. Finally, each segment is decked at the hinder edge with two\r\nspots of a fairly bright red. A costume like this was never worn by a\r\nworm.\r\n\r\nLet us leave this ill-chosen denomination and ask ourselves what the\r\nLampyris feeds upon. That master of the art of gastronomy,\r\nBrillat-Savarin,[1] said:\r\n\r\n\"Show me what you eat and I will tell you what you are.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Anthelme Brillat-Savarin (1755-1826), author of _La\r\nPsychologie du gout_.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nA similar question should be addressed, by way of a preliminary, to\r\nevery insect whose habits we propose to study, for, from the least to\r\nthe greatest in the zoological progression, the stomach sways the\r\nworld; the data supplied by food are the chief of all the documents of\r\nlife. Well, in spite of his innocent appearance, the Lampyris is an\r\neater of flesh, a hunter of game; and he follows his calling with rare\r\nvillainy. His regular prey is the Snail.\r\n\r\nThis detail has long been known to entomologists. What is not so\r\nwell-known, what is not known at all yet, to judge by what I have\r\nread, is the curious method of attack, of which I have seen no other\r\ninstance anywhere.\r\n\r\nBefore he begins to feast, the Glow-worm administers an anaesthetic:\r\nhe chloroforms his victim, rivalling in the process the wonders of our\r\nmodern surgery, which renders the patient insensible before operating\r\non him. The usual game is a small Snail hardly the size of a cherry,\r\nsuch as, for instance, _Helix variabilis_, DRAP., who, in the hot\r\nweather, collects in clusters on the stiff stubble and on other long,\r\ndry stalks, by the roadside, and there remains motionless, in profound\r\nmeditation, throughout the scorching summer days. It is in some such\r\nresting-place as this that I have often been privileged to light upon\r\nthe Lampyris banqueting on the prey which he had just paralyzed on its\r\nshaky support by his surgical artifices.\r\n\r\nBut he is familiar with other preserves. He frequents the edges of the\r\nirrigating-ditches, with their cool soil, their varied vegetation, a\r\nfavourite haunt of the mollusc. Here, he treats the game on the\r\nground; and, under these conditions, it is easy for me to rear him at\r\nhome and to follow the operator's performance down to the smallest\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nI will try to make the reader a witness of the strange sight. I place\r\na little grass in a wide glass jar. In this I install a few Glow-worms\r\nand a provision of Snails of a suitable size, neither too large nor\r\ntoo small, chiefly _Helix variabilis_. We must be patient and wait.\r\nAbove all, we must keep an assiduous watch, for the desired events\r\ncome unexpectedly and do not last long.\r\n\r\nHere we are at last. The Glow-worm for a moment investigates the prey,\r\nwhich, according to its habit, is wholly withdrawn in the shell,\r\nexcept the edge of the mantle, which projects slightly. Then the\r\nhunter's weapon is drawn, a very simple weapon, but one that cannot be\r\nplainly perceived without the aid of a lens. It consists of two\r\nmandibles bent back powerfully into a hook, very sharp and as thin as\r\na hair. The microscope reveals the presence of a slender groove\r\nrunning throughout the length. And that is all.\r\n\r\nThe insect repeatedly taps the Snail's mantle with its instrument. It\r\nall happens with such gentleness as to suggest kisses rather than\r\nbites. As children, teasing one another, we used to talk of\r\n\"tweaksies\" to express a slight squeeze of the finger-tips, something\r\nmore like a tickling than a serious pinch. Let us use that word. In\r\nconversing with animals, language loses nothing by remaining juvenile.\r\nIt is the right way for the simple to understand one another.\r\n\r\nThe Lampyris doles out his tweaks. He distributes them methodically,\r\nwithout hurrying, and takes a brief rest after each of them, as though\r\nhe wished to ascertain the effect produced. Their number is not great:\r\nhalf-a-dozen, at most, to subdue the prey and deprive it of all power\r\nof movement. That other pinches are administered later, at the time of\r\neating, seems very likely, but I cannot say anything for certain,\r\nbecause the sequel escapes me. The first few, however--there are never\r\nmany--are enough to impart inertia and loss of all feeling to the\r\nmollusc, thanks to the prompt, I might almost say, lightning methods\r\nof the Lampyris, who, beyond a doubt, instils some poison or other by\r\nmeans of his grooved hooks.\r\n\r\nHere is the proof of the sudden efficacity of those twitches, so mild\r\nin appearance: I take the Snail from the Lampyris, who has operated on\r\nthe edge of the mantle some four or five times. I prick him with a\r\nfine needle in the fore-part, which the animal, shrunk into its shell,\r\nstill leaves exposed. There is no quiver of the wounded tissues, no\r\nreaction against the brutality of the needle. A corpse itself could\r\nnot give fewer signs of life.\r\n\r\nHere is something even more conclusive: chance occasionally gives me\r\nSnails attacked by the Lampyris while they are creeping along, the\r\nfoot slowly crawling, the tentacles swollen to their full extent. A\r\nfew disordered movements betray a brief excitement on the part of the\r\nmollusc and then everything ceases: the foot no longer slugs; the\r\nfront-part loses its graceful swan-neck curve; the tentacles become\r\nlimp and give way under their weight, dangling feebly like a broken\r\nstick. This conditions persists.\r\n\r\nIs the Snail really dead? Not at all, for I am free to resuscitate the\r\nseeming corpse. After two or three days of that singular condition\r\nwhich is no longer life and yet not death, I isolate the patient and,\r\nalthough this is not really necessary to success, I give him a douche\r\nwhich will represent the shower so dear to the able-bodied mollusc. In\r\nabout a couple of days, my prisoner, but lately injured by the\r\nGlow-worm's treachery, is restored to his normal state. He revives, in\r\na manner; he recovers movement and sensibility. He is affected by the\r\nstimulus of a needle; he shifts his place, crawls, puts out his\r\ntentacles, as though nothing unusual had occurred. The general torpor,\r\na sort of deep drunkenness, has vanished outright. The dead returns to\r\nlife. What name shall we give to that form of existence which, for a\r\ntime, abolishes the power of movement and the sense of pain? I can see\r\nbut one that is approximately suitable: anaesthesia. The exploits of a\r\nhost of Wasps whose flesh-eating grubs are provided with meat that is\r\nmotionless though not dead[2] have taught us the skilful art of the\r\nparalyzing insect, which numbs the locomotory nerve-centres with its\r\nvenom. We have now a humble little animal that first produces complete\r\nanaesthesia in its patient. Human science did not in reality invent\r\nthis art, which is one of the wonders of our latter-day surgery. Much\r\nearlier, far back in the centuries, the Lampyris and, apparently,\r\nothers knew it as well. The animal's knowledge had a long start of\r\nours; the method alone has changed. Our operators proceed by making us\r\ninhale the fumes of ether or chloroform; the insect proceeds by\r\ninjecting a special virus that comes from the mandibular fangs in\r\ninfinitesimal doses. Might we not one day be able to benefit by this\r\nhint? What glorious discoveries the future would have in store for us,\r\nif we understood the beastie's secrets better!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Cf. _The Hunting Wasps_, by J. Henri Fabre, translated by\r\nAlexander Teixeira de Mattos: _passim_.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nWhat does the Lampyris want with anaesthetical talent against a\r\nharmless and moreover eminently peaceful adversary, who would never\r\nbegin the quarrel of his own accord? I think I see. We find in Algeria\r\na Beetle known as _Drilus maroccanus_, who, though non-luminous,\r\napproaches our Glow-worm in his organization and especially in his\r\nhabits. He too feeds on land molluscs. His prey is a Cyclostome with a\r\ngraceful spiral shell, tight-closed with a stony lid which is attached\r\nto the animal by a powerful muscle. The lid is a movable door which is\r\nquickly shut by the inmate's mere withdrawal into his house and as\r\neasily opened when the hermit goes forth. With this system of closing,\r\nthe abode becomes inviolable; and the Drilus knows it.\r\n\r\nFixed to the surface of the shell by an adhesive apparatus whereof the\r\nLampyris will presently show us the equivalent, he remains on the\r\nlook-out, waiting, if necessary, for whole days at a time. At last,\r\nthe need of air and food oblige the besieged noncombatant to show\r\nhimself; at least, the door is set slightly ajar. That is enough. The\r\nDrilus is on the spot and strikes his blow. The door can no longer be\r\nclosed and the assailant is henceforth master of the fortress. Our\r\nfirst impression is that the muscle moving the lid has been cut with a\r\nquick-acting pair of shears. This idea must be dismissed. The Drilus\r\nis not well enough equipped with jaws to gnaw through a fleshy mass so\r\npromptly. The operation has to succeed at once, at the first touch: if\r\nnot, the animal attacked would retreat, still in full vigour, and the\r\nsiege must be recommenced, as arduous as ever, exposing the insect to\r\nfasts indefinitely prolonged. Although I have never come across the\r\nDrilus, who is a stranger to my district, I conjecture a method of\r\nattack very similar to that of the Glow-worm. Like our own\r\nSnail-eater, the Algerian insect does not cut its victim into small\r\npieces: it renders it inert, chloroforms it by means of a few tweaks\r\nwhich are easily distributed, if the lid but half-opens for a second.\r\nThat will do. The besieger thereupon enters and, in perfect quiet,\r\nconsumes a prey incapable of the least muscular effort. That is how I\r\nsee things by the unaided light of logic.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the Glow-worm. When the Snail is on the ground,\r\ncreeping, or even shrunk into his shell, the attack never presents any\r\ndifficulty. The shell possesses no lid and leaves the hermit's\r\nfore-part to a great extent exposed. Here, on the edges of the mantle\r\ncontracted by the fear of danger, the mollusc is vulnerable and\r\nincapable of defence. But it also frequently happens that the Snail\r\noccupies a raised position, clinging to the tip of a grass-stalk or\r\nperhaps to the smooth surface of a stone. This support serves him as a\r\ntemporary lid; it wards off the aggression of any churl who might try\r\nto molest the inhabitant of the cabin, always on the express condition\r\nthat no slit show itself anywhere on the protecting circumference. If,\r\non the other hand, in the frequent case when the shell does not fit\r\nits support quite closely, some point, however tiny, be left\r\nuncovered, this is enough for the subtle tools of the Lampyris, who\r\njust nibbles at the mollusc and at once plunges him into that profound\r\nimmobility which favours the tranquil proceedings of the consumer.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings are marked by extreme prudence. The assailant has to\r\nhandle his victim gingerly, without provoking contractions which would\r\nmake the Snail let go his support and, at the very least, precipitate\r\nhim from the tall stalk whereon he is blissfully slumbering. Now any\r\ngame falling to the ground would seem to be so much sheer loss, for\r\nthe Glow-worm has no great zeal for hunting-expeditions: he profits by\r\nthe discoveries which good luck sends him, without undertaking\r\nassiduous searches. It is essential, therefore, that the equilibrium\r\nof a prize perched on the top of a stalk and only just held in\r\nposition by a touch of glue should be disturbed as little as possible\r\nduring the onslaught; it is necessary that the assailant should go to\r\nwork with infinite circumspection and without producing pain, lest any\r\nmuscular reaction should provoke a fall and endanger the prize. As we\r\nsee, sudden and profound anaesthesia is an excellent means of enabling\r\nthe Lampyris to attain his object, which is to consume his prey in\r\nperfect quiet.\r\n\r\nWhat is his manner of consuming it? Does he really eat, that is to\r\nsay, does he divide his food piecemeal, does he carve it into minute\r\nparticles, which are afterwards ground by a chewing-apparatus? I think\r\nnot. I never see a trace of solid nourishment on my captives' mouths.\r\nThe Glow-worm does not eat in the strict sense of the word: he drinks\r\nhis fill; he feeds on a thin gruel into which he transforms his prey\r\nby a method recalling that of the maggot. Like the flesh-eating grub\r\nof the Fly, he too is able to digest before consuming; he liquefies\r\nhis prey before feeding on it.\r\n\r\nThis is how things happen: a Snail has been rendered insensible by the\r\nGlow-worm. The operator is nearly always alone, even when the prize is\r\na large one, like the Common Snail, _Helix aspersa_. Soon a number of\r\nguests hasten up--two, three or more--and, without any quarrel with\r\nreal proprietor, all alike fall to. Let us leave them to themselves\r\nfor a couple of days and then turn the shell, with the opening\r\ndownwards. The contents flow out as easily as would soup from an\r\noverturned saucepan. When the sated diners retire from this gruel,\r\nonly insignificant leavings remain.\r\n\r\nThe matter is obvious: by repeated tiny bites, similar to the tweaks\r\nwhich we saw distributed at the outset, the flesh of the mollusc is\r\nconverted into a gruel on which the various banqueters nourish\r\nthemselves without distinction, each working at the broth by means of\r\nsome special pepsine and each taking his own mouthfuls of it. In\r\nconsequence of this method, which first converts the food into a\r\nliquid, the Glow-worm's mouth must be very feebly armed apart from the\r\ntwo fangs which sting the patient and inject the anaesthetic poison\r\nand, at the same time, no doubt, the serum capable of turning the\r\nsolid flesh into fluid. These two tiny implements, which can just be\r\nexamined through the lens, must, it seems, have some other object.\r\nThey are hollow and in this resemble those of the Ant-lion, which\r\nsucks and drains its capture without having to divide it; but there is\r\nthis great difference, that the Ant-lion leaves copious remnants,\r\nwhich are afterwards flung outside the funnel-shaped trap dug in the\r\nsand, whereas the Glow-worm, that expert liquefier, leaves nothing, or\r\nnext to nothing. With similar tools, the one simply sucks the blood of\r\nits prey and the other turns every morsel of his to account, thanks to\r\na preliminary liquefaction.\r\n\r\nAnd this is done with exquisite precision, though the equilibrium is\r\nsometimes anything but steady. My rearing-glasses supply me with\r\nmagnificent examples. Crawling up the sides, the Snails imprisoned in\r\nmy apparatus sometimes reach the top, which is closed with a glass\r\npane, and fix themselves to it by means of a speck of glair. This is a\r\nmere temporary halt, in which the mollusc is miserly with its adhesive\r\nproduct, and the merest shake is enough to loosen the shell and send\r\nit to the bottom of the jar.\r\n\r\nNow it is not unusual for the Glow-worm to hoist himself to the top,\r\nwith the help of a certain climbing-organ that makes up for his weak\r\nlegs. He selects his quarry, makes a minute inspection of it to find\r\nan entrance-slit, nibbles it a little, renders it insensible and,\r\nwithout delay, proceeds to prepare the gruel which he will consume for\r\ndays on end.\r\n\r\nWhen he leaves the table, the shell is found to be absolutely empty;\r\nand yet this shell, which was fixed to the glass by a very faint\r\nstickiness, has not come loose, has not even shifted its position in\r\nthe smallest degree: without any protest from the hermit gradually\r\nconverted into broth, it has been drained on the very spot at which\r\nthe first attack was delivered. These small details tell us how\r\npromptly the anaesthetic bite takes effect; they teach us how\r\ndexterously the Glow-worm treats his Snail without causing him to fall\r\nfrom a very slippery vertical support and without even shaking him on\r\nhis slight line of adhesion.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions of equilibrium, the operator's short, clumsy\r\nlegs are obviously not enough; a special accessory apparatus is needed\r\nto defy the danger of slipping and to seize the unseizable. And this\r\napparatus the Lampyris possesses. At the hinder end of the animal we\r\nsee a white spot which the lens separates into some dozen short,\r\nfleshy appendages, sometimes gathered into a cluster, sometimes spread\r\ninto a rosette. There is your organ of adhesion and locomotion. If he\r\nwould fix himself somewhere, even on a very smooth surface, such as a\r\ngrass-stalk, the Glow-worm opens his rosette and spreads it wide on\r\nthe support, to which it adheres by its own stickiness. The same\r\norgan, rising and falling, opening and closing, does much to assist\r\nthe act of progression. In short, the Glow-worm is a new sort of\r\nself-propelled cripple, who decks his hind-quarters with a dainty\r\nwhite rose, a kind of hand with twelve fingers, not jointed, but\r\nmoving in every direction: tubular fingers which do not seize, but\r\nstick.\r\n\r\nThe same organ serves another purpose: that of a toilet-sponge and\r\nbrush. At a moment of rest, after a meal, the Glow-worm passes and\r\nrepasses the said brush over his head, back, sides and hinder-parts, a\r\nperformance made possible by the flexibility of his spine. This is\r\ndone point by point, from one end of the body to the other, with a\r\nscrupulous persistency that proves the great interest which he takes\r\nin the operation. What is his object in thus sponging himself, in\r\ndusting and polishing himself so carefully? It is a question,\r\napparently, of removing a few atoms of dust or else some traces of\r\nviscidity that remain from the evil contact with the snail. A wash and\r\nbrush-up is not superfluous when one leaves the tub in which the\r\nmollusc has been treated.\r\n\r\nIf the Glow-worm possessed no other talent than that of chloroforming\r\nhis prey by means of a few tweaks resembling kisses, he would be\r\nunknown to the vulgar herd; but he also knows how to light himself\r\nlike a beacon; he shines, which is an excellent manner of achieving\r\nfame. Let us consider more particularly the female, who, while\r\nretaining her larval shape, becomes marriageable and glows at her best\r\nduring the hottest part of summer. The lighting-apparatus occupies the\r\nlast three segments of the abdomen. On each of the first two, it takes\r\nthe form, on the ventral surface, of a wide belt covering almost the\r\nwhole of the arch; on the third, the luminous part is much less and\r\nconsists simply of two small crescent-shaped markings, or rather two\r\nspots which shine through to the back and are visible both above and\r\nbelow the animal. Belts and spots emit a glorious white light,\r\ndelicately tinged with blue. The general lighting of the Glow-worm\r\nthus comprises two groups: first, the wide belts of the two segments\r\npreceding the last; secondly, the two spots of the final segments. The\r\ntwo belts, the exclusive attribute of the marriageable female, are the\r\npart richest in light: to glorify her wedding, the future mother dons\r\nher brightest gauds; she lights her two resplendent scarves. But,\r\nbefore that, from the time of the hatching, she had only the modest\r\nrush-light of the stern. This efflorescence of light is the equivalent\r\nof the final metamorphosis, which is usually represented by the gift\r\nof wings and flight. Its brilliance heralds the pairing-time. Wings\r\nand flight there will be none: the female retains her humble larval\r\nform, but she kindles her blazing beacon.\r\n\r\nThe male, on his side, is fully transformed, changes his shape,\r\nacquires wings and wing-cases; nevertheless, like the female, he\r\npossesses, from the time when he is hatched, the pale lamp of the end\r\nsegment. This luminous aspect of the stern is characteristic of the\r\nentire Glow-worm tribe, independently of sex and season. It appears\r\nupon the budding grub and continues throughout life unchanged. And we\r\nmust not forget to add that it is visible on the dorsal as well as on\r\nthe ventral surface, whereas the two large belts peculiar to the\r\nfemale shine only under the abdomen.\r\n\r\nMy hand is not so steady nor my sight so good as once they were, but,\r\nas far as they allow me, I consult anatomy for the structure of the\r\nluminous organs. I take a scrap of the epidermis and manage to\r\nseparate pretty neatly half of one of the shining belts. I place my\r\npreparation under the microscope. On the skin, a sort of white-wash\r\nlies spread, formed of a very fine, granular substance. This is\r\ncertainly the light-producing matter. To examine this white layer more\r\nclosely is beyond the power of my weary eyes. Just beside it is a\r\ncurious air-tube, whose short and remarkably wide stem branches\r\nsuddenly into a sort of bushy tuft of very delicate ramifications.\r\nThese creep over the luminous sheet, or even dip into it. That is all.\r\n\r\nThe luminescence, therefore, is controlled by the respiratory organs\r\nand the work produced is an oxidization. The white sheet supplies the\r\noxidizable matter and the thick air-tube spreading into a tufty bush\r\ndistributes the flow of air over it. There remains the question of the\r\nsubstance whereof this sheet is formed. The first suggestion was\r\nphosphorus, in the chemist's sense of the word. The Glow-worm has been\r\ncalcined and treated with the violent reagents that bring the simple\r\nsubstances to light; but no one, so far as I know, has obtained a\r\nsatisfactory answer along these lines. Phosphorus seems to play no\r\npart here, in spite of the name of phosphorescence which is sometimes\r\nbestowed upon the Glow-worm's gleam. The answer lies elsewhere, no one\r\nknows where.\r\n\r\nWe are better informed as regards another question. Has the Glow-worm\r\na free control of the light which he emits? Can he turn it on or down\r\nor put it out as he pleases? Has he an opaque screen which is drawn\r\nover the flame at will, or is that flame always left exposed? There is\r\nno need for any such mechanism: the insect has something better for\r\nits revolving light.\r\n\r\nThe thick tube supplying the light-producing sheet increases the flow\r\nof air and the light is intensified; the same air-tube, swayed by the\r\nanimal's will, slackens or even suspends the passage of air and the\r\nlight grows fainter or even goes out. It is, in short, the mechanism\r\nof a lamp which is regulated by the access of air to the wick.\r\n\r\nExcitement can set the attendant air-duct in motion. We must here\r\ndistinguish between two cases: that of the gorgeous scarves, the\r\nexclusive ornament of the female ripe for matrimony, and that of the\r\nmodest fairy-lamp on the last segment, which both sexes kindle at any\r\nage. In the second case, the extinction caused by a flurry is sudden\r\nand complete, or nearly so. In my nocturnal hunts for young\r\nGlow-worms, measuring about 5 millimetres long,[3] I can plainly see\r\nthe glimmer on the blades of grass; but, should the least false step\r\ndisturb a neighbouring twig, the light goes out at once and the\r\ncoveted insect becomes invisible. Upon the full-grown females, lit up\r\nwith their nuptial scarves, even a violent start has but a slight\r\neffect and often none at all.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: .195 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nI fire a gun beside a wire-gauze cage in which I am rearing my\r\nmenagerie of females in the open air. The explosion produces no\r\nresult. The illumination continues, as bright and placid as before. I\r\ntake a spray and rain down a slight shower of cold water upon the\r\nflock. Not one of my animals puts out its light; at the very most,\r\nthere is a brief pause in the radiance; and then only in some cases. I\r\nsend a puff of smoke from my pipe into the cage. This time, the pause\r\nis more marked. There are even some extinctions, but these do not last\r\nlong. Calm soon returns and the light is renewed as brightly as ever.\r\nI take some of the captives in my fingers, turn and return them, tease\r\nthem a little. The illumination continues and is not much diminished,\r\nif I do not press too hard with my thumb. At this period, with the\r\npairing close at hand, the insect is in all the fervour of its\r\npassionate splendour; and nothing short of very serious reasons would\r\nmake it put out its signals altogether.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, there is not a doubt but that the Glow-worm\r\nhimself manages his lighting-apparatus, extinguishing and rekindling\r\nit at will; but there is one point at which the voluntary agency of\r\nthe insect is without effect. I detach a strip of the epidermis\r\nshowing one of the luminescent sheets and place it in a glass tube,\r\nwhich I close with a plug of damp wadding, to avoid too rapid an\r\nevaporation. Well, this scrap of carcass shines away merrily, although\r\nnot quite as brilliantly as on the living body.\r\n\r\nLife's aid is now superfluous. The oxidizable substance, the\r\nluminescent sheet, is in direct communication with the surrounding\r\natmosphere; the flow of oxygen through an air-tube is not necessary;\r\nand the luminous emission continues to take place, in the same way as\r\nwhen it is produced by the contact of the air with the real phosphorus\r\nof the chemists. Let us add that, in aerated water, the luminousness\r\ncontinues as brilliant as in the free air, but that it is extinguished\r\nin water deprived of its air by boiling. No better proof could be\r\nfound of what I have already propounded, namely, that the Glow-worm's\r\nlight is the effect of a slow oxidization.\r\n\r\nThe light is white, calm and soft to the eyes and suggests a spark\r\ndropped by the full moon. Despite its splendour, it is a very feeble\r\nilluminant. If we move a Glow-worm along a line of print, in perfect\r\ndarkness, we can easily make out the letters, one by one, and even\r\nwords, when these are not too long; but nothing more is visible beyond\r\na narrow zone. A lantern of this kind soon tires the reader's\r\npatience.\r\n\r\nSuppose a group of Glow-worms placed almost touching one another. Each\r\nof them sheds its glimmer, which ought, one would think, to light up\r\nits neighbours by reflexion and give us a clear view of each\r\nindividual specimen. But not at all: the luminous party is a chaos in\r\nwhich our eyes are unable to distinguish any definite form at a medium\r\ndistance. The collective lights confuse the link-bearers into one\r\nvague whole.\r\n\r\nPhotography gives us a striking proof of this. I have a score of\r\nfemales, all at the height of their splendour, in a wire-gauze cage in\r\nthe open air. A tuft of thyme forms a grove in the centre of their\r\nestablishment. When night comes, my captives clamber to this pinnacle\r\nand strive to show off their luminous charms to the best advantage at\r\nevery point of the horizon, thus forming along the twigs marvellous\r\nclusters from which I expected magnificent effects on the\r\nphotographer's plates and paper. My hopes are disappointed. All that I\r\nobtain is white, shapeless patches, denser here and less dense there\r\naccording to the numbers forming the group. There is no picture of the\r\nGlow-worms themselves; not a trace either of the tuft of thyme. For\r\nwant of satisfactory light, the glorious firework is represented by a\r\nblurred splash of white on a black ground.\r\n\r\nThe beacons of the female Glow-worms are evidently nuptial signals,\r\ninvitations to the pairing; but observe that they are lighted on the\r\nlower surface of the abdomen and face the ground, whereas the summoned\r\nmales, whose flights are sudden and uncertain, travel overhead, in the\r\nair, sometimes a great way up. In its normal position, therefore, the\r\nglittering lure is concealed from the eyes of those concerned; it is\r\ncovered by the thick bulk of the bride. The lantern ought really to\r\ngleam on the back and not under the belly; otherwise the light is\r\nhidden under a bushel.\r\n\r\nThe anomaly is corrected in a very ingenious fashion, for every female\r\nhas her little wiles of coquetry. At nightfall, every evening, my\r\ncaged captives make for the tuft of thyme with which I have\r\nthoughtfully furnished the prison and climb to the top of the upper\r\nbranches, those most in sight. Here, instead of keeping quiet, as they\r\ndid at the foot of the bush just now, they indulge in violent\r\nexercises, twist the tip of their very flexible abdomen, turn it to\r\none side, turn it to the other, jerk it in every direction. In this\r\nway, the search-light cannot fail to gleam, at one moment or another,\r\nbefore the eyes of every male who goes a-wooing in the neighbourhood,\r\nwhether on the ground or in the air.\r\n\r\nIt is very like the working of the revolving mirror used in catching\r\nLarks. If stationary, the little contrivance would leave the bird\r\nindifferent; turning and breaking up its light in rapid flashes, it\r\nexcites it.\r\n\r\nWhile the female Glow-worm has her tricks for summoning her swains,\r\nthe male, on his side, is provided with an optical apparatus suited to\r\ncatch from afar the least reflection of the calling-signal. His\r\ncorselet expands into a shield and overlaps his head considerably in\r\nthe form of a peaked cap or eye-shade, the object of which appears to\r\nbe to limit the field of vision and concentrate the view upon the\r\nluminous speck to be discerned. Under this arch are the two eyes,\r\nwhich are relatively enormous, exceedingly convex, shaped like a\r\nskull-cap and contiguous to the extent of leaving only a narrow groove\r\nfor the insertion of the antennae. This double eye, occupying almost\r\nthe whole face of the insect and contained in the cavern formed by the\r\nspreading peak of the corselet, is a regular Cyclop's eye.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of the pairing, the illumination becomes much fainter,\r\nis almost extinguished; all that remains alight is the humble\r\nfairy-lamp of the last segment. This discreet night-light is enough\r\nfor the wedding, while, all around, the host of nocturnal insects,\r\nlingering over their respective affairs, murmur the universal\r\nmarriage-hymn. The laying follows very soon. The round, white eggs are\r\nlaid, or rather strewn at random, without the least care on the\r\nmother's part, either on the more or less cool earth or on a blade of\r\ngrass. These brilliant ones know nothing at all of family-affection.\r\n\r\nHere is a very singular thing: the Glow-worm's eggs are luminous even\r\nwhen still contained in the mother's womb. If I happen by accident to\r\ncrush a female big with germs that have reached maturity, a shiny\r\nstreak runs along my fingers, as though I had broken some vessel\r\nfilled with a phosphorescent fluid. The lens shows me that I am wrong.\r\nThe luminosity comes from the cluster of eggs forced out of the ovary.\r\nBesides, as laying-time approaches, the phosphorescence of the eggs is\r\nalready made manifest without this clumsy midwifery. A soft opalescent\r\nlight shines through the skin of the belly.\r\n\r\nThe hatching follows soon after the laying. The young of either sex\r\nhave two little rush-lights on the last segment. At the approach of\r\nthe severe weather, they go down into the ground, but not very far. In\r\nmy rearing-jars, which are supplied with fine and very loose earth,\r\nthey descend to a depth of three or four inches at most. I dig up a\r\nfew in mid-winter. I always find them carrying their faint\r\nstern-light. About the month of April, they come up again to the\r\nsurface, there to continue and complete their evolution.\r\n\r\nFrom start to finish, the Glow-worm's life is one great orgy of light.\r\nThe eggs are luminous; the grubs likewise. The full-grown females are\r\nmagnificent light-houses, the adult males retain the glimmer which the\r\ngrubs already possessed. We can understand the object of the feminine\r\nbeacon; but of what use is all the rest of the pyrotechnic display? To\r\nmy great regret, I cannot tell. It is and will be, for many a day to\r\ncome, perhaps for all time, the secret of animal physics, which is\r\ndeeper than the physics of the books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nTHE SITARES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe high banks of sandy clay in the country round about Carpentras are\r\nthe favourite haunts of a host of Bees and Wasps, those lovers of a\r\nthoroughly sunny aspect and of soils that are easy to excavate. Here,\r\nin the month of May, two Anthophorae[1] are especially abundant,\r\ngatherers of honey and, both of them, makers of subterranean cells.\r\nOne, _A. parietina_, builds at the entrance of her dwelling an\r\nadvanced fortification, an earthy cylinder, wrought in open work, like\r\nthat of the Odynerus,[2] and curved like it, but of the width and\r\nlength of a man's finger. When the community is a populous one, we\r\nstand amazed at the rustic ornamentation formed by all these\r\nstalactites of clay hanging from the facade. The other, _A. pilipes_,\r\nwho is very much more frequent, leaves the opening of her corridor\r\nbare. The chinks between the stones in old walls and abandoned hovels,\r\nthe surfaces of excavations in soft sandstone or marl, are found\r\nsuitable for her labours; but the favourite spots, those to which the\r\ngreatest number of swarms resort, are vertical stretches, exposed to\r\nthe south, such as are afforded by the cuttings of deeply sunken\r\nroads. Here, over areas many yards in width, the wall is drilled with\r\na multitude of holes, which impart to the earthy mass the look of some\r\nenormous sponge. These round holes might be fashioned with an auger,\r\nso regular are they. Each is the entrance to a winding corridor, which\r\nruns to a depth of four to six inches. The cells are distributed at\r\nthe far end. If we would witness the labours of the industrious Bee,\r\nwe must repair to her workshop during the latter half of May. Then,\r\nbut at a respectful distance, if, as novices, we are afraid of being\r\nstung, we may contemplate, in all its bewildering activity, the\r\ntumultuous, buzzing swarm, busied with the building and the\r\nprovisioning of the cells.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Cf. _The Mason-bees_, by J. Henri Fabre, translated by\r\nAlexander Teixeira de Mattos: chap. viii.; and _Bramble-bees and\r\nOthers_, by J. Henri Fabre, translated by Alexander Teixeira de\r\nMattos: _passim_.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Cf. _The Mason-wasps_, by J. Henri Fabre, translated by\r\nAlexander Teixeira de Mattos: chaps. vi. and x.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nIt is most often during the months of August and September, those\r\nhappy months of the summer holidays, that I have visited the banks\r\ninhabited by the Anthophora. At this period all is silent near the\r\nnests; the work has long been completed; and numbers of Spiders' webs\r\nline the crevices or plunge their silken tubes into the Bee's\r\ncorridors. Let us not, however, hastily abandon the city once so\r\npopulous, so full of life and bustle and now deserted. A few inches\r\nbelow the surface, thousands of larvae and nymphs, imprisoned in their\r\ncells of clay, are resting until the coming spring. Might not such a\r\nsucculent prey as these larvae, paralysed and incapable of defence,\r\ntempt certain parasites who are industrious enough to attain them?\r\n\r\nHere indeed are some Flies clad in a dismal livery, half-black,\r\nhalf-white, a species of Anthrax (_A. sinuata_),[3] flying indolently\r\nfrom gallery to gallery, doubtless with the object of laying their\r\neggs there; and here are others, more numerous, whose mission is\r\nfulfilled and who, having died in harness, are hanging dry and\r\nshrivelled in the Spiders' webs. Elsewhere the entire surface of a\r\nperpendicular bank is hung with the dried corpses of a Beetle\r\n(_Sitaris humeralis_), slung, like the Flies, in the silken meshes of\r\nthe Spiders. Among these corpses some male Sitares circle, busy,\r\namorous, heedless of death, mating with the first female that passes\r\nwithin reach, while the fertilized females thrust their bulky abdomens\r\ninto the opening of a gallery and disappear into it backwards. It is\r\nimpossible to mistake the situation: some grave interest attracts to\r\nthis spot these two insects, which, within a few days, make their\r\nappearance, mate, lay their eggs and die at the very doors of the\r\nAnthophora's dwellings.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Cf. _The Life of the Fly_, by J. Henri Fabre, translated\r\nby Alexander Teixeira de Mattos: chaps. ii. and iv.--_Translator's\r\nNote_.]\r\n\r\nLet us now give a few blows of the pick to the surface beneath which\r\nthe singular incidents already in our mind must be occurring, beneath\r\nwhich similar things occurred last year; perhaps we shall find some\r\nevidence of the parasitism which we suspected. If we search the\r\ndwellings of the Anthophorae during the early days of August, this is\r\nwhat we see: the cells forming the superficial layer are not like\r\nthose situated at a greater depth. This difference arises from the\r\nfact that the same establishment is exploited simultaneously by the\r\nAnthophora and by an Osmia (_O. tricornis_)[4] as is proved by an\r\nobservation made at the working-period, in May. The Anthophorae are\r\nthe actual pioneers, the work of boring the galleries is wholly\r\ntheirs; and their cells are situated right at the end. The Osmia\r\nprofits by the galleries which have been abandoned either because of\r\ntheir age, or because of the completion of the cells occupying the\r\nmost distant part; she builds her cells by dividing these corridors\r\ninto unequal and inartistic chambers by means of rude earthen\r\npartitions. The Osmia's sole achievement in the way of masonry is\r\nconfined to these partitions. This, by the way, is the ordinary\r\nbuilding-method adopted by the various Osmiae, who content themselves\r\nwith a chink between two stones, an empty Snail-shell, or the dry and\r\nhollow stem of some plant, wherein to build their stacks of cells, at\r\nsmall expense, by means of light partitions of mortar.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Cf. _Bramble-bees and Others_: _passim_.--_Translator's\r\nNote_.]\r\n\r\nThe cells of the Anthophora, with their faultless geometrical\r\nregularity and their perfect finish, are works of art, excavated, at a\r\nsuitable depth, in the very substance of the loamy bank, without any\r\nmanufactured part save the thick lid that closes the orifice. Thus\r\nprotected by the prudent industry of their mother, well out of reach\r\nin their distant, solid retreats, the Anthophora's larvae are devoid\r\nof the glandular apparatus designed for secreting silk. They therefore\r\nnever spin a cocoon, but lie naked in their cells, whose inner surface\r\nhas the polish of stucco.\r\n\r\nIn the Osmia's cells, on the other hand, means of defence are\r\nrequired, for these are situated in the surface layer of the bank;\r\nthey are irregular in form, rough inside and barely protected, by\r\ntheir thin earthen partitions, against external enemies. The Osmia's\r\nlarvae, in fact, contrive to enclose themselves in an egg-shaped\r\ncocoon, dark brown in colour and very strong, which preserves them\r\nboth from the rough contact of their shapeless cells and from the\r\nmandibles of voracious parasites, Acari,[5] Cleri[6] and Anthreni,[7]\r\nthose manifold enemies whom we find prowling in the galleries, seeking\r\nwhom they may devour. It is by means of this equipoise between the\r\nmother's talents and the larva's that the Osmia and the Anthophora, in\r\ntheir early youth, escape some part of the dangers which threaten\r\nthem. It is easy therefore, in the bank excavated by these two Bees,\r\nto recognize the property of either species by the situation and form\r\nof the cells and also by their contents, which consist, with the\r\nAnthophora, of a naked larva and, with the Osmia, of a larva enclosed\r\nin a cocoon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Mites and Ticks.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: A genus of Beetles of which certain species (_Clerus\r\napiarius_ and _C. alvearius_) pass their preparatory state in the\r\nnests of Bees, where they feed on the grubs.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Another genus of Beetles. The grub of _A. musaeorum_, the\r\nMuseum Beetle, is very destructive to\r\ninsect-collections.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nOn opening a certain number of these cocoons, we end by discovering\r\nsome which, in place of the Osmia's larva, contain each a curiously\r\nshaped nymph. These nymphs, at the least shock received by their\r\ndwelling, indulge in extravagant movements, lashing the walls with\r\ntheir abdomen till the whole house shakes and dances. And, even if we\r\nleave the cocoon intact, we are informed of their presence by a dull\r\nrustle heard inside the silken dwelling the moment after we move it.\r\n\r\nThe fore-part of this nymph is fashioned like a sort of boar's-snout\r\narmed with six strong spikes, a multiple ploughshare, eminently\r\nadapted for burrowing in the soil. A double row of hooks surmounts the\r\ndorsal ring of the four front segments of the abdomen. These are so\r\nmany grappling-irons, with whose assistance the creature is enabled to\r\nprogress in the narrow gallery dug by the snout. Lastly, a sheaf of\r\nsharp points forms the armour of the hinder-part. If we examine\r\nattentively the surface of the vertical wall which contains the\r\nvarious nests, it will not be long before we discover nymphs like\r\nthose which we have been describing, with one extremity held in a\r\ngallery of their own diameter, while the fore-part projects freely\r\ninto the air. But these nymphs are reduced to their cast skins, along\r\nthe back and head of which runs a long slit through which the perfect\r\ninsect has escaped. The purpose of the nymph's powerful weapons is\r\nthus made manifest: it is the nymph that has to rend the tough cocoon\r\nwhich imprisons it, to excavate the tightly-packed soil in which it is\r\nburied, to dig a gallery with its six-pointed snout and thus to bring\r\nto the light the perfect insect, which apparently is incapable of\r\nperforming these strenuous tasks for itself.\r\n\r\nAnd in fact these nymphs, taken in their cocoons, have in a few days'\r\ntime given me a feeble Fly (_Anthrax sinuata_) who is quite incapable\r\nof piercing the cocoon and still more of making her exit through a\r\nsoil which I cannot easily break up with my pick. Although similar\r\nfacts abound in insect history, we always notice them with a lively\r\ninterest. They tell us of an incomprehensible power which suddenly, at\r\na given moment, irresistibly commands an obscure grub to abandon the\r\nretreat in which it enjoys security, in order to make its way through\r\na thousand difficulties and to reach the light, which would be fatal\r\nto it on any other occasion, but which is necessary to the perfect\r\ninsect, which could not reach it by its own efforts.\r\n\r\nBut the layer of Osmia-cells has been removed; and the pick now\r\nreaches the Anthophora's cells. Among these cells are some which\r\ncontain larvae and which result from the labours of last May; others,\r\nthough of the same date, are already occupied by the perfect insect.\r\nThe precocity of metamorphosis varies from one larva to another;\r\nhowever, a few days' difference of age is enough to explain these\r\ninequalities of development. Other cells, as numerous as the first,\r\ncontain a parasitical Hymenopteron, a Melecta (_M. armata_), likewise\r\nin the perfect state. Lastly, there are some, indeed many, which\r\ncontain a singular egg-shaped shell, divided into segments with\r\nprojecting breathing-pores. This shell is extremely thin and fragile;\r\nit is amber-coloured and so transparent that one can distinguish quite\r\nplainly, through its sides, an adult Sitaris (_S. humeralis_), who\r\noccupies the interior and is struggling as though to set herself at\r\nliberty. This explains the presence here, the pairing and the\r\negg-laying of the Sitares whom we but now saw roaming, in the company\r\nof the Anthrax-flies, at the entrance to the galleries of the\r\nAnthophorae. The Osmia and the Anthophora, the joint owners of the\r\npremises, have each their parasite: the Anthrax attacks the Osmia and\r\nthe Sitaris the Anthophora.\r\n\r\nBut what is this curious shell in which the Sitaris is invariably\r\nenclosed, a shell unexampled in the Beetle order? Can this be a case\r\nof parasitism in the second degree, that is, can the Sitaris be living\r\ninside the chrysalis of a first parasite, which itself exists at the\r\ncost of the Anthophora's larva or of its provisions? And, even so, how\r\ncan this parasite, or these parasites, obtain access to a cell which\r\nseems to be inviolable, because of the depth at which it lies, and\r\nwhich, moreover, does not reveal, to the most careful examination\r\nunder the magnifying-glass, any violent inroad on the enemy's part?\r\nThese are the questions that presented themselves to my mind when for\r\nthe first time, in 1855, I observed the facts which I have just\r\nrelated. Three years of assiduous observation enabled me to add one of\r\nits most astonishing chapters to the story of the formation of\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nAfter collecting a fairly large number of these enigmatical shells\r\ncontaining adult Sitares, I had the satisfaction of observing, at\r\nleisure, the emergence of the perfect insect from the shell, the act\r\nof pairing and the laying of the eggs. The shell is easily broken; a\r\nfew strokes of the mandibles, distributed at random, a few kicks are\r\nenough to deliver the perfect insect from its fragile prison.\r\n\r\nIn the glass jars in which I kept my Sitares I saw the pairing follow\r\nvery closely upon the first moments of freedom. I even witnessed a\r\nfact which shows emphatically how imperious, in the perfect insect, is\r\nthe need to perform, without delay, the act intended to ensure the\r\npreservation of its race. A female, with her head already cut out of\r\nthe shell, is anxiously struggling to release herself entirely; a\r\nmale, who has been free for a couple of hours, climbs on the shell\r\nand, tugging here and there, with his mandibles, at the fragile\r\nenvelope, strives to deliver the female from her shackles. His efforts\r\nare soon crowned with success; and, though the female is still three\r\nparts swathed in her swaddling-bands, the coupling takes place\r\nimmediately, lasting about a minute. During the act, the male remains\r\nmotionless on the top of the shell, or on the top of the female when\r\nthe latter is entirely free. I do not know whether, in ordinary\r\ncircumstances, the male occasionally thus helps the female to gain her\r\nliberty; to do so he would have to penetrate into a cell containing a\r\nfemale, which, after all, is not beyond his powers, seeing that he has\r\nbeen able to escape from his own. Still, on the actual site of the\r\ncells, the coupling is generally performed at the entrance to the\r\ngalleries of the Anthophorae; and then neither of the sexes drags\r\nabout with it the least shred of the shell from which it has emerged.\r\n\r\nAfter mating, the two Sitares proceed to clean their legs and antennae\r\nby drawing them between their mandibles; then each goes his own way.\r\nThe male cowers in a crevice of the earthen bank, lingers for two or\r\nthree days and perishes. The female also, after getting rid of her\r\neggs, which she does without delay, dies at the entrance to the\r\ncorridor in which the eggs are laid. This is the origin of all those\r\ncorpses swinging in the Spiders' web with which the neighbourhood of\r\nthe Anthophora's dwellings is upholstered.\r\n\r\nThus the Sitares in the perfect state live long enough only to mate\r\nand to lay their eggs. I have never seen one save upon the scene of\r\ntheir loves, which is also that of their death; I have never surprised\r\none browsing on the plants near at hand, so that, though they are\r\nprovided with a normal digestive apparatus, I have grave reasons to\r\ndoubt whether they actually take any nourishment whatever. What a life\r\nis theirs! A fortnight's feasting in a storehouse of honey; a year of\r\nslumber underground; a minute of love in the sunlight; then death!\r\n\r\nOnce fertilized, restlessly the female at once proceeds to seek a\r\nfavourable spot wherein to lay her eggs. It was important to note\r\nwhere this exact spot is. Does the female go from cell to cell,\r\nconfiding an egg to the succulent flanks of each larva, whether this\r\nlarva belong to the Anthophora or to a parasite of hers, as the\r\nmysterious shell whence the Sitaris emerges would incline one to\r\nbelieve? This method of laying the eggs, one at a time in each cell,\r\nwould appear to be essential, if we are to explain the facts already\r\nascertained. But then why do the cells usurped by the Sitares retain\r\nnot the slightest trace of the forcible entry which is indispensable?\r\nAnd how is it that, in spite of lengthy investigations during which my\r\nperseverance has been kept up by the keenest desire to cast some light\r\nupon all these mysteries, how is it, I say, that I have never come\r\nacross a single specimen of the supposed parasites to which the shell\r\nmight be attributed, since this shell appears not to be a Beetle's?\r\nThe reader would hardly suspect how my slight acquaintance with\r\nentomology was unsettled by this inextricable maze of contradictory\r\nfacts. But patience! We may yet obtain some light.\r\n\r\nLet us begin by observing precisely at what spot the eggs are laid. A\r\nfemale has just been fertilized before my eyes; she is forthwith\r\nplaced in a large glass jar, into which I put, at the same time, some\r\nclods of earth containing Anthophora-cells. These cells are occupied\r\npartly by larvae and partly by nymphs that are still quite white; some\r\nare slightly open and afford a glimpse of their contents. Lastly, in\r\nthe inner surface of the cork which closes the jar I sink a\r\ncylindrical well, a blind alley, of the same diameter as the corridors\r\nof the Anthophora. In order that the insect, if it so desire, may\r\nenter this artificial corridor, I lay the bottle horizontally.\r\n\r\nThe female, painfully dragging her big abdomen, perambulates all the\r\nnooks and corners of her makeshift dwelling, exploring them with her\r\npalpi, which she passes everywhere. After half an hour of groping and\r\ncareful investigation, she ends by selecting the horizontal gallery\r\ndug in the cork. She thrusts her abdomen into this cavity and, with\r\nher head hanging outside, begins her laying. Not until thirty-six\r\nhours later was the operation completed; and during this incredible\r\nlapse of time the patient creature remained absolutely motionless.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are white, oval and very small. They measure barely\r\ntwo-thirds of a millimetre[8] in length. They stick together slightly\r\nand are piled in a shapeless heap which might be likened to a\r\ngood-sized pinch of the unripe seeds of some orchid. As for their\r\nnumber, I will admit that it tried my patience to no purpose. I do\r\nnot, however, believe that I am exaggerating when I estimate it as at\r\nleast two thousand. Here are the data on which I base this figure: the\r\nlaying, as I have said, lasts thirty-six hours; and my frequent visits\r\nto the female working in the cavity in the cork convinced me that\r\nthere was no perceptible interruption in the successive emission of\r\nthe eggs. Now less than a minute elapses between the arrival of one\r\negg and that of the next; and the number of these eggs cannot\r\ntherefore be lower than the number of minutes contained in thirty-six\r\nhours, or 2160. But the exact number is of no importance: we need only\r\nnote that it is very large, which implies, for the young larvae\r\nissuing from the eggs, very numerous chances of destruction, since so\r\nlavish a supply of germs is necessary to maintain the species in the\r\nrequisite proportions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: .026 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nEnlightened by these observations and informed of the shape, the\r\nnumber and the arrangement of the eggs, I searched the galleries of\r\nthe Anthophorae for those which the Sitares had laid there and\r\ninvariably found them gathered in a heap inside the galleries, at a\r\ndistance of an inch or two from the orifice, which is always open to\r\nthe outer world. Thus, contrary to what one was to some extent\r\nentitled to suppose, the eggs are not laid in the cells of the pioneer\r\nBee; they are simply dumped in a heap inside the entrance to her\r\ndwelling. Nay more, the mother does not make any protective structure\r\nfor them; she takes no pains to shield them from the rigours of\r\nwinter; she does not even attempt, by stopping for a short distance,\r\nas best she can, the entrance-lobby in which she has laid them, to\r\nprotect them from the thousand enemies that threaten them; for, as\r\nlong as the frosts of winter have not arrived, these open galleries\r\nare trodden by Spiders, by Acari, by Anthrenus-grubs and other\r\nplunderers, to whom these eggs, or the young larvae about to emerge\r\nfrom them, must be a dainty feast. In consequence of the mother's\r\nheedlessness, the number of those who escape all these voracious\r\nhunters and the inclemencies of the weather must be curiously small.\r\nThis perhaps explains why she is compelled to make up by her fecundity\r\nfor her deficient industry.\r\n\r\nThe hatching occurs a month later, about the end of September or the\r\nbeginning of October. The season being still propitious, I was led to\r\nsuppose that the young larvae must at once make a start and disperse,\r\nin order that each might seek to gain access, through some\r\nimperceptible fissure, to an Anthophora-cell. This presumption turned\r\nout to be entirely at fault. In the boxes in which I had placed the\r\neggs laid by my captives, the young larvae, little black creatures at\r\nmost a twenty-fifth of an inch long, did not move away, provided\r\nthough they were with vigorous legs; they remained higgledy-piggledy\r\nwith the white skins of the eggs whence they had emerged.\r\n\r\nIn vain I placed within their reach lumps of earth containing nests of\r\nthe Anthophora, open cells, larvae and nymphs of the Bee: nothing was\r\nable to tempt them; they persisted in forming, with the egg-skins, a\r\npowdery heap of speckled black and white. It was only by drawing the\r\npoint of a needle through this pinch of living dust that I was able to\r\nprovoke an active wriggling. Apart from this, all was still. If I\r\nforcibly removed a few larvae from the common heap, they at once\r\nhurried back to it, in order to hide themselves among the rest.\r\nPerhaps they had less reason to fear the cold when thus collected and\r\nsheltered beneath the egg-skins. Whatever may be the motive that\r\nimpels them to remain thus gathered in a heap, I recognized that none\r\nof the means suggested by my imagination succeeded in forcing them to\r\nabandon the little spongy mass formed by the skins of the eggs, which\r\nwere slightly glued together. Lastly, to assure myself that the\r\nlarvae, in the free state, do not disperse after they are hatched, I\r\nwent during the winter to Carpentras and inspected the banks inhabited\r\nby the Anthophorae. There, as in my boxes, I found the larvae piled\r\ninto heaps, all mixed up with the skins of the eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nTHE PRIMARY LARVA OF THE SITARES\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing new happens before the end of the following April. I shall\r\nprofit by this long period of repose to tell you more about the young\r\nlarva, of which I will begin by giving a description. Its length is a\r\ntwenty-fifth of an inch, or a little less. It is hard as leather, a\r\nglossy greenish black, convex above and flat below, long and slender,\r\nwith a diameter increasing gradually from the head to the hinder\r\nextremity of the metathorax, after which it rapidly diminishes. Its\r\nhead is a trifle longer than it is wide and is slightly dilated at the\r\nbase; it is pale-red near the mouth and darker about the ocelli.\r\n\r\nThe labrum forms a segment of a circle; it is reddish, edged with a\r\nsmall number of very short, stiff hairs. The mandibles are powerful,\r\nred-brown, curved and sharp; when at rest they meet without crossing.\r\nThe maxillary palpi are rather long, consisting of two cylindrical\r\nsections of equal length, the outer ending in a very short bristle.\r\nThe jaws and the lower lip are not sufficiently visible to lend\r\nthemselves to accurate description.\r\n\r\nThe antennae consist of two cylindrical segments, equal in length, not\r\nvery definitely divided; these segments are nearly as long as those of\r\nthe palpi; the outer is surmounted by a cirrus whose length is as much\r\nas thrice that of the head and tapers off until it becomes invisible\r\nunder a powerful pocket-lens. Behind the base of either antennae are\r\ntwo ocelli, unequal in size and almost touching.\r\n\r\nThe thoracic segments are of equal length and increase gradually in\r\nwidth from front to back. The prothorax is wider than the head, but is\r\nnarrower in front than at the base and is slightly rounded at the\r\nsides. The legs are of medium length and fairly robust, ending in a\r\nlong, powerful, sharp and very mobile claw. On the haunch and thigh of\r\neach leg is a long cirrus, like that of the antennae, almost as long\r\nas the whole limb and standing at right angles to the plane of\r\nlocomotion when the creature moves. There are a few stiff bristles on\r\nthe legs.\r\n\r\nThe abdomen has nine segments, of practically equal length, but\r\nshorter than those of the thorax and diminishing very rapidly in width\r\ntoward the last. Fixed below the eighth segment, or rather below the\r\nstrip of membrane separating this segment and the last, we see two\r\nspikes, slightly curved, short, but with strong, sharp, hard points,\r\nand placed one to the right and the other to the left of the median\r\nline. These two appendages are able, by means of a mechanism\r\nrecalling, on a smaller scale, that of the Snail's horns, to withdraw\r\ninto themselves, as a result of the membranous character of their\r\nbase. They can also retreat under the eighth segment, borne, as they\r\nare, by the anal segment, when this last, as it contracts, withdraws\r\ninto the eighth. Lastly, the ninth or anal segment bears on its hinder\r\nedge two long cirri, like those of the legs and the antennae, curving\r\nbackwards from tip to base. At the rear of this segment a fleshy\r\nnipple appears, more or less prominent; this is the anus. I do not\r\nknow where the stigmata are placed; they have evaded my\r\ninvestigations, though these were undertaken with the aid of the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nWhen the larva is at rest, the various segments overlap evenly; and\r\nthe membranous intervals, corresponding with the articulations, do not\r\nshow. But, when the larva walks, all the articulations, especially\r\nthose of the abdominal segments, are distended and end by occupying\r\nalmost as much space as the horny arches. At the same time the anal\r\nsegment emerges from the sheath formed by the eighth; the anus, in\r\nturn, is stretched into a nipple; and the two points of the\r\npenultimate ring rise, at first slowly, and then suddenly stand up\r\nwith an abrupt motion similar to that of a spring when released. In\r\nthe end, these two points diverge like the horns of a crescent. Once\r\nthis complex apparatus is unfolded, the tiny creature is ready to\r\ncrawl upon the most slippery surface.\r\n\r\nThe last segment and its anal button are curved at right angles to the\r\naxis of the body; and the anus comes and presses upon the surface of\r\nlocomotion, where it ejects a tiny drop of transparent, treacly fluid,\r\nwhich glues and holds the little creature firmly in position,\r\nsupported on a sort of tripod formed by the anal button and the two\r\ncirri of the last segment. If we are observing the animal's manner of\r\nlocomotion on a strip of glass, we can hold the strip in a vertical\r\nposition, or even turn it upside down, or shake it lightly, without\r\ncausing the larva to become detached and fall, held fast as it is by\r\nthe glutinous secretion of the anal button.\r\n\r\nIf it has to proceed along a surface where there is no danger of a\r\nfall, the microscopic creature employs another method. It crooks its\r\nbelly and, when the two spikes of the eighth segment, now fully\r\noutspread, have found a firm support by ploughing, so to speak, the\r\nsurface of locomotion, it bears upon that base and pushes forward by\r\nexpanding the various abdominal articulations. This forward movement\r\nis also assisted by the action of the legs, which are far from\r\nremaining inactive. This done, it casts anchor with the powerful claws\r\nof its feet; the abdomen contracts; the various segments draw\r\ntogether; and the anus, pulled forward, obtains a fresh purchase, with\r\nthe aid of the two spikes, before beginning the second of these\r\ncurious strides.\r\n\r\nDuring these manoeuvres, the cirri of the flanks and thighs drag along\r\nthe supporting surface and by their length and elasticity appear\r\nfitted only to impede progress. But let us not be in a hurry to\r\nconclude that we have discovered an inconsistency: the least of\r\ncreatures is adapted to the conditions amid which it has to live;\r\nthere is reason to believe that these filaments, far from hampering\r\nthe pigmy's progress, must, in normal circumstances, be of some\r\nassistance to it.\r\n\r\nEven the little that we have just learnt shows us that the young\r\nSitaris-larva is not called upon to move on an ordinary surface. The\r\nspot, whatever it may be like, where this larva is to live later\r\nexposes it to the risk of many dangerous falls, since, in order to\r\nprevent them, it is not only equipped with strong and extremely mobile\r\ntalons and a steel-shod crescent, a sort of ploughshare capable of\r\nbiting into the most highly polished substance, but is further\r\nprovided with a viscous liquid, sufficiently tenacious and adhesive to\r\nhold it in position without the help of other appliances. In vain I\r\nracked my brains to guess what the substance might be, so shifting, so\r\nuncertain and so perilous, which the young Sitares are destined to\r\ninhabit; and I discovered nothing to explain the necessity for the\r\nstructure which I have described. Convinced beforehand, by an\r\nattentive examination of this structure, that I should witness some\r\npeculiar habits, I waited with eager impatience for the return of the\r\nwarm weather, never doubting that by dint of persevering observation\r\nthe mystery would be disclosed to me next spring. At last this spring,\r\nso fervently desired, arrived; I brought to bear all the patience, all\r\nthe imagination, all the insight and discernment that I may possess;\r\nbut, to my utter shame and still greater regret, the secret escaped\r\nme. Oh, how painful are those tortures of indecision, when one has to\r\npostpone till the following year an investigation which has led to no\r\nresult!\r\n\r\nMy observations made during the spring of 1856, although purely\r\nnegative, nevertheless have an interest of their own, because they\r\nprove the inaccuracy of certain suppositions to which the undeniable\r\nparasitism of the Sitares naturally inclines us. I will therefore\r\nrelate them in a few words. At the end of April, the young larvae,\r\nhitherto motionless and concealed in the spongy heap of the egg-skins,\r\nemerge from their immobility, scatter and run about in all directions\r\nthrough the boxes and jars in which they have passed the winter. By\r\ntheir hurried gait and their indefatigable evolutions we readily guess\r\nthat they are seeking something which they lack. What can this\r\nsomething be, unless it be food? For remember that these larvae were\r\nhatched at the end of September and that since then, that is to say,\r\nfor seven long months, they have taken no nourishment, though they\r\nhave spent this period in the full enjoyment of their vitality, as I\r\nwas able to assure myself all through the winter by irritating them,\r\nand not in a state of torpor similar to that of the hibernating\r\nanimals. From the moment of their hatching they are doomed, although\r\nfull of life, to an absolute abstinence of seven months' duration; and\r\nit is natural to suppose, when we see their present excitement, that\r\nan imperious hunger sets them bustling in this fashion.\r\n\r\nThe desired nourishment could only be the contents of the cells of the\r\nAnthophora, since we afterwards find the Sitares in these cells. Now\r\nthese contents are limited to honey or larvae. It just happens that I\r\nhave kept some Anthophora-cells occupied by larvae or nymphs. I place\r\na few of these, some open, some closed, within reach of the young\r\nSitares, as I had already done directly after the hatching. I even\r\nslip the Sitares into the cells: I place them on the sides of the\r\nlarva, a succulent morsel to all appearances; I do all sorts of things\r\nto tempt their appetite; and, after exhausting my ingenuity, which\r\ncontinues fruitless, I remain convinced that my famished grubs are\r\nseeking neither the larvae nor nymphs of the Anthophora.\r\n\r\nLet us now try honey. We must obviously employ honey prepared by the\r\nsame species of Anthophora as that at whose cost the Sitares live. But\r\nthis Bee is not very common in the neighbourhood of Avignon; and my\r\nengagements at the college[1] do not allow me to absent myself for the\r\npurpose of repairing to Carpentras, where she is so abundant. In\r\nhunting for cells provisioned with honey I thus lose a good part of\r\nthe month of May; however, I end by finding some which are newly\r\nsealed and which belong to the right Anthophora. I open these cells\r\nwith the feverish impatience of a sorely-tried longing. All goes well:\r\nthey are half-full of fluid, dark, nauseating honey, with the Bee's\r\nlately-hatched larva floating on the surface. This larva is removed;\r\nand taking a thousand precautions, I lay one or more Sitares on the\r\nsurface of the honey. In other cells I leave the Bee's larva and\r\ninsert Sitares, placing them sometimes on the honey and sometimes on\r\nthe inner wall of the cell or simply at the entrance. Lastly, all the\r\ncells thus prepared are put in glass tubes, which enable me to observe\r\nthem readily, without fear of disturbing my famished guests at their\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Fabre, as a young man, was a master at Avignon College.\r\nCf. _The Life of the Fly_: chaps. xii., xiii., xix. and\r\nxx.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nBut what am I saying? Their meal? There is no meal! The Sitares,\r\nplaced at the entrance to a cell, far from seeking to make their way\r\nin, leave it and go roaming about the glass tube; those which have\r\nbeen placed on the inner surface of the cells, near the honey, emerge\r\nprecipitately, half-caught in the glue and tripping at every step;\r\nlastly, those which I thought I had favoured the most, by placing them\r\non the honey itself, struggle, become entangled in the sticky mass and\r\nperish in it, suffocated. Never did experiment break down so\r\ncompletely! Larvae, nymphs, cells, honey: I have offered you them all!\r\nThen what do you want, you fiendish little creatures?\r\n\r\nTired of all these fruitless attempts, I ended where I ought to have\r\nbegun: I went to Carpentras. But it was too late: the Anthophora had\r\nfinished her work; and I did not succeed in seeing anything new.\r\nDuring the course of the year I learnt from Leon Dufour,[2] to whom I\r\nhad spoken of the Sitares, that the tiny creature which he had found\r\non the Andrenae[3] and described under the generic name of\r\nTriungulinus, was recognized later by Newport[4] as the larva of a\r\nMeloe, or Oil-beetle. Now it so happened that I had found a few\r\nOil-beetles in the cells of the same Anthophora that nourishes the\r\nSitares. Could there be a similarity of habits between the two kinds\r\nof insects? This idea threw a sudden light for me upon the subject;\r\nbut I had plenty of time in which to mature my plans: I had another\r\nyear to wait.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Jean Marie Leon Dufour (1780-1865), an army surgeon who\r\nserved with distinction in several campaigns, and subsequently\r\npractised as a doctor in the Landes, where he attained great eminence\r\nas a naturalist. Fabre often refers to him as the Wizard of the\r\nLandes. Cf. _The Life of the Spider_, by J. Henri Fabre, translated by\r\nAlexander Teixeira de Mattos: chap. i.; and _The Life of the Fly_:\r\nchap. i.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: A genus of Burrowing Bee, the most numerous in species\r\namong the British Bees.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: George Newport (1803-1854), an English surgeon and\r\nnaturalist, president of the Entomological Society from 1844 to 1845\r\nand an expert in insect anatomy.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nWhen April came, my Sitaris-larvae began, as usual, to bestir\r\nthemselves. The first Bee to appear, an Osmia, is dropped alive into a\r\nglass jar containing a few of these larvae; and after a lapse of some\r\nfifteen minutes I inspect them through the pocket-lens. Five Sitares\r\nare embedded in the fleece of the thorax. It is done, the problem's\r\nsolved! The larvae of the Sitares, like those of the Oil-beetles,\r\ncling like grim death to the fleece of their generous host and make\r\nhim carry them into the cell. Ten times over I repeat the experiment\r\nwith the various Bees that come to plunder the lilac flowering outside\r\nmy window and in particular with male Anthophorae; the result is still\r\nthe same: the larvae embed themselves in the hair of the Bees' thorax.\r\nBut after so many disappointments one becomes distrustful and it is\r\nbetter to go and observe the facts upon the spot; besides, the Easter\r\nholidays fall very conveniently and afford me the leisure for my\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nI will admit that my heart was beating a little faster than usual when\r\nI found myself once again standing in front of the perpendicular bank\r\nin which the Anthophora nests. What will be the result of the\r\nexperiment? Will it once more cover me with confusion? The weather is\r\ncold and rainy; not a Bee shows herself on the few spring flowers that\r\nhave come out. Numbers of Anthophorae cower, numbed and motionless, at\r\nthe entrance to the galleries. With the tweezers, I extract them one\r\nby one from their lurking-places, to examine them under the lens. The\r\nfirst has Sitaris-larvae on her thorax; so has the second; the third\r\nand fourth likewise; and so on, as far as I care to pursue the\r\nexamination. I change galleries ten times, twenty times; the result is\r\ninvariable. Then, for me, occurred one of the moments which come to\r\nthose who, after considering and reconsidering an idea for years and\r\nyears from every point of view, are at last able to cry: \"Eureka!\"\r\n\r\nOn the days that followed, a serene and balmy sky enabled the\r\nAnthophorae to leave their retreats and scatter over the countryside\r\nand despoil the flowers. I renewed my examination on those Anthophorae\r\nflying incessantly from one flower to another, whether in the\r\nneighbourhood of the places where they were born or at great distances\r\nfrom these places. Some were without Sitaris-larvae; others, more\r\nnumerous, had two, three, four, five or more among the hairs of their\r\nthorax. At Avignon, where I have not yet seen _Sitaris humeralis_, the\r\nsame species of Anthophora, observed at almost the same season, while\r\npillaging the lilac-blossom, was always free of young Sitaris-grubs;\r\nat Carpentras, on the contrary, where there is not a single\r\nAnthophora-colony without Sitares, nearly three-quarters of the\r\nspecimens which I examined carried a few of these larvae in their\r\nfleece.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, if we look for these larvae in the\r\nentrance-lobbies where we found them, a few days ago, piled up in\r\nheaps, we no longer see them. Consequently, when the Anthophorae,\r\nhaving opened their cells, enter the galleries to reach the exit and\r\nfly away, or else when the bad weather and the darkness bring them\r\nback there for a time, the young Sitaris-larvae, kept on the alert in\r\nthese same galleries by the stimulus of instinct, attach themselves to\r\nthe Bees, wriggling into their fur and clutching it so firmly that\r\nthey need not fear a fall during the long journeys of the insect which\r\ncarries them. By thus attaching themselves to the Anthophorae the\r\nyoung Sitares evidently intend to get themselves carried, at the\r\nopportune moment, into the victualled cells.\r\n\r\nOne might even at first sight believe that they live for some time on\r\nthe Anthophora's body, just as the ordinary parasites, the various\r\nspecies of Lice, live on the body of the animal that feeds them. But\r\nnot at all. The young Sitares, embedded in the fleece, at right angles\r\nto the Anthophora's body, head inwards, rump outwards, do not stir\r\nfrom the point which they have selected, a point near the Bee's\r\nshoulders. We do not see them wandering from spot to spot, exploring\r\nthe Anthophora's body, seeking the part where the skin is more\r\ndelicate, as they would certainly do if they were really deriving some\r\nnourishment from the juices of the Bee. On the contrary, they are\r\nnearly always established on the toughest and hardest part of the\r\nBee's body, on the thorax, a little below the insertion of the wings,\r\nor, more rarely, on the head; and they remain absolutely motionless,\r\nfixed to the same hair, by means of the mandibles, the feet, the\r\nclosed crescent of the eighth segment and, lastly, the glue of the\r\nanal button. If they chance to be disturbed in this position, they\r\nreluctantly repair to another point of the thorax, pushing their way\r\nthrough the insect's fur and in the end fastening on to another hair,\r\nas before.\r\n\r\nTo confirm my conviction that the young Sitaris-grubs do not feed on\r\nthe Anthophora's body, I have sometimes placed within their reach, in\r\na glass jar, some Bees that have long been dead and are completely\r\ndried up. On these dry corpses, fit at most for gnawing, but certainly\r\ncontaining nothing to suck, the Sitaris-larvae took up their customary\r\nposition and there remained motionless as on the living insect. They\r\nobtain nothing, therefore, from the Anthophora's body; but perhaps\r\nthey nibble her fleece, even as the Bird-lice nibble the birds'\r\nfeathers?\r\n\r\nTo do this, they would require mouth-parts endowed with a certain\r\nstrength and, in particular, horny and sturdy jaws, whereas their jaws\r\nare so fine that a microscopic examination failed to show them to me.\r\nThe larvae, it is true, are provided with powerful mandibles; but\r\nthese finely-pointed mandibles, with their backward curve, though\r\nexcellent for tugging at food and tearing it to pieces, are useless\r\nfor grinding it or gnawing it. Lastly, we have a final proof of the\r\npassive condition of the Sitaris-larvae on the body of the Anthophorae\r\nin the fact that the Bees do not appear to be in any way incommoded by\r\ntheir presence, since we do not see them trying to rid themselves of\r\nthe grubs. Some Anthophorae which were free from these grubs and some\r\nothers which were carrying five or six upon their bodies were placed\r\nseparately in glass jars. When the first disturbance resulting from\r\ntheir captivity was appeased, I could see nothing peculiar about those\r\noccupied by the young Sitares. And, if all these arguments were not\r\nsufficient, I might add that a creature which has already been able to\r\nspend seven months without food and which in a few days' time will\r\nproceed to drink a highly-flavoured fluid would be guilty of a\r\nsingular inconsistency if it were to start nibbling the dry fleece of\r\na Bee. It therefore seems to me undeniable that the young Sitares\r\nsettle on the Anthophora's body merely to make her carry them into the\r\ncells which she will soon be building.\r\n\r\nBut until then the future parasites must hold tight to the fleece of\r\ntheir hostess, despite her rapid evolutions among the flowers, despite\r\nher rubbing against the walls of the galleries when she enters to take\r\nshelter and, above all, despite the brushing which she must often give\r\nherself with her feet to dust herself and keep spick and span. Hence\r\nno doubt the need for that curious apparatus which no standing or\r\nmoving upon ordinary surfaces could explain, as was said above, when\r\nwe were wondering what the shifting, swaying, dangerous body might be\r\non which the larva would have to establish itself later. This body is\r\na hair of a Bee who makes a thousand rapid journeys, now diving into\r\nher narrow galleries, now forcing her way down the tight throat of a\r\ncorolla, and who never rests except to brush herself with her feet and\r\nremove the specks of dust collected by the down which covers her.\r\n\r\nWe can now easily understand the use of the projecting crescent whose\r\ntwo horns, by closing together, are able to take hold of a hair more\r\neasily than the most delicate tweezers; we perceive the full value of\r\nthe tenacious adhesive provided by the anus to save the tiny creature,\r\nat the least sign of danger, from an imminent fall; we realize lastly\r\nthe useful function that may be fulfilled by the elastic cirri of the\r\nflanks and legs, which are an absolute and most embarrassing\r\nsuperfluity when walking upon a smooth surface, but which, in the\r\npresent case, penetrate like so many probes into the thickness of the\r\nAnthophora's down and serve as it were to anchor the Sitaris-larva in\r\nposition. The more we consider this arrangement, which seems modelled\r\nby a blind caprice so long as the grub drags itself laboriously over a\r\nsmooth surface, the more do we marvel at the means, as effective as\r\nthey are varied, which are lavished upon this fragile creature to help\r\nit to preserve its unstable equilibrium.\r\n\r\nBefore I describe what becomes of the Sitaris-grubs on leaving the\r\nbody of the Anthophorae, I must not omit to mention one very\r\nremarkable peculiarity. All the Bees invaded by these grubs that have\r\nhitherto been observed have, without one exception, been male\r\nAnthophorae. Those whom I drew from their lurking-places were males;\r\nthose whom I caught upon the flowers were males; and, in spite of the\r\nmost active search, I failed to find a single female at liberty. The\r\ncause of this total absence of females is easy to understand.\r\n\r\nIf we remove a few clods from the area occupied by the nests, we see\r\nthat, though all the males have already opened and abandoned their\r\ncells, the females, on the contrary, are still enclosed in theirs, but\r\non the point of soon taking flight. This appearance of the males\r\nalmost a month before the emergence of the females is not peculiar to\r\nthe Anthophorae; I have observed it in many other Bees and\r\nparticularly in the Three-horned Osmia (_O. tricornis_), who inhabits\r\nthe same site as the Hairy-footed Anthophora (_A. pilipes_). The males\r\nof the Osmia make their appearance even before those of the Anthophora\r\nand at so early a season that the young Sitaris-larvae are perhaps not\r\nyet aroused by the instinctive impulse which urges them to activity.\r\nIt is no doubt to their precocious awakening that the males of the\r\nOsmia owe their ability to traverse with impunity the corridors in\r\nwhich the young Sitaris-grubs are heaped together, without having the\r\nlatter fasten to their fleece; at least, I cannot otherwise explain\r\nthe absence of these larvae from the backs of the male Osmiae, since,\r\nwhen we place them artificially in the presence of these Bees, they\r\nfasten on them as readily as on the Anthophorae.\r\n\r\nThe emergence from the common site begun by the male Osmiae is\r\ncontinued by the male Anthophorae and ends with the almost\r\nsimultaneous emergence of the female Osmiae and Anthophorae. I was\r\neasily able to verify this sequence by observing at my own place, in\r\nthe early spring, the dates at which the cells, collected during the\r\nprevious autumn, were broken.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of their emergence, the male Anthophorae, passing\r\nthrough the galleries in which the Sitaris-larvae are waiting on the\r\nalert, must pick up a certain number of them; and those among them\r\nwho, by entering empty corridors, escape the enemy on this first\r\noccasion will not evade him for long, for the rain, the chilly air and\r\nthe darkness bring them back to their former homes, where they take\r\nshelter now in one gallery, now in another, during a great part of\r\nApril. This constant traffic of the males in the entrance-lobbies of\r\ntheir houses and the prolonged stay which the bad weather often\r\ncompels them to make provide the Sitares with the most favourable\r\nopportunity for slipping into the Bees' fur and taking up their\r\nposition. Moreover, when this state of affairs has lasted a month or\r\nso, there can be only very few if any larvae left wandering about\r\nwithout having attained their end. At that period I was unable to find\r\nthem anywhere save on the body of the male Anthophora.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore extremely probable that, on their emergence, which\r\ntakes place as May draws near, the female Anthophorae do not pick up\r\nSitaris-larvae in the corridors, or pick up only a number which will\r\nnot compare with that carried by the males. In fact, the first females\r\nthat I was able to observe in April, in the actual neighbourhood of\r\nthe nests, were free from these larvae. Nevertheless it is upon the\r\nfemales that the Sitaris-larvae must finally establish themselves, for\r\nthe males upon whom they now are cannot introduce them into the cells,\r\nsince they take no part in the building or provisioning. There is\r\ntherefore, at a given moment, a transfer of Sitaris-larvae from the\r\nmale Anthophorae to the females; and this transfer is, beyond a doubt,\r\neffected during the union of the sexes. The female finds in the male's\r\nembraces both life and death for her offspring; at the moment when she\r\nsurrenders herself to the male for the preservation of her race, the\r\nvigilant parasites pass from the male to the female, with the\r\nextermination of that same race in view.\r\n\r\nIn support of these deductions, here is a fairly conclusive\r\nexperiment, though it reproduces the natural circumstances but\r\nroughly. On a female taken in her cell and therefore free from\r\nSitares, I place a male who is infested with them; and I keep the two\r\nsexes in contact, suppressing their unruly movements as far as I am\r\nable. After fifteen or twenty minutes of this enforced proximity, the\r\nfemale is invaded by one or more of the larvae which at first were on\r\nthe male. True, experiment does not always succeed under these\r\nimperfect conditions.\r\n\r\nBy watching at Avignon the few Anthophorae that I succeeded in\r\ndiscovering, I was able to detect the precise moment of their work;\r\nand on the following Thursday,[5] the 21st of May, I repaired in all\r\nhaste to Carpentras, to witness, if possible, the entrance of the\r\nSitares into the Bee's cells. I was not mistaken: the works were in\r\nfull swing.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Thursday is the weekly holiday in French\r\nschools.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nIn front of a high expanse of earth, a swarm stimulated by the sun,\r\nwhich floods it with light and heat, is dancing a crazy ballet. It is\r\na hover of Anthophorae, a few feet thick and covering an area which\r\nmatches the sort of house-front formed by the perpendicular soil. From\r\nthe tumultuous heart of the cloud rises a monotonous, threatening\r\nmurmur, while the bewildered eye strays through the inextricable\r\nevolutions of the eager throng. With the rapidity of a lightning-flash\r\nthousands of Anthophorae are incessantly flying off and scattering\r\nover the country-side in search of booty; thousands of others also are\r\nincessantly arriving, laden with honey or mortar, and keeping up the\r\nformidable proportions of the swarm.\r\n\r\nI was at that time something of a novice as regards the nature of\r\nthese insects:\r\n\r\n\"Woe,\" said I to myself, \"woe to the reckless wight bold enough to\r\nenter the heart of this swarm and, above all, to lay a rash hand upon\r\nthe dwellings under construction! Forthwith surrounded by the furious\r\nhost, he would expiate his rash attempt, stabbed by a thousand\r\nstings!\"\r\n\r\nAt this thought, rendered still more alarming by the recollection of\r\ncertain misadventures of which I had been the victim when seeking to\r\nobserve too closely the combs of the Hornet (_Vespa crabro_), I felt a\r\nshiver of apprehension pass through my body.\r\n\r\nYet, to obtain light upon the question which brings me hither, I must\r\nneeds penetrate the fearsome swarm; I must stand for whole hours,\r\nperhaps all day, watching the works which I intend to upset; lens in\r\nhand, I must scrutinize, unmoved amid the whirl, the things that are\r\nhappening in the cells. The use moreover of a mask, of gloves, of a\r\ncovering of any kind is impracticable, for utter dexterity of the\r\nfingers and complete liberty of sight are essential to the\r\ninvestigations which I have to make. No matter: even though I leave\r\nthis wasps'-nest with a face swollen beyond recognition, I must to-day\r\nobtain a decisive solution of the problem which has preoccupied me too\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nA few strokes of the net, aimed, beyond the limits of the swarm, at\r\nthe Anthophorae on their way to the harvest or returning, soon\r\ninformed me that the Sitaris-larvae are perched on the thorax, as I\r\nexpected, occupying the same position as on the males. The\r\ncircumstances therefore could not be more favourable. We will inspect\r\nthe cells without further delay.\r\n\r\nMy preparations are made at once: I button my clothes tightly, so as\r\nto afford the Bees the least possible opportunity, and I enter the\r\nheart of the swarm. A few blows of the mattock, which arouse a far\r\nfrom reassuring crescendo in the humming of the Anthophorae, soon\r\nplace me in possession of a lump of earth; and I beat a hasty retreat,\r\ngreatly astonished to find myself still safe and sound and unpursued.\r\nBut the lump of earth which I have removed is from a part too near the\r\nsurface; it contains nothing but Osmia-cells, which do not interest me\r\nfor the moment. A second expedition is made, lasting longer than the\r\nfirst; and, though my retreat is effected without great precipitation,\r\nnot an Anthophora has touched me with her sting, nor even shown\r\nherself disposed to fall upon the aggressor.\r\n\r\nThis success emboldens me. I remain permanently in front of the work\r\nin progress, continually removing lumps of earth filled with cells,\r\nspilling the liquid honey on the ground, eviscerating larvae and\r\ncrushing the Bees busily occupied in their nests. All this devastation\r\nresults merely in arousing a louder hum in the swarm and is not\r\nfollowed by any hostile demonstration. The Anthophorae whose cells are\r\nnot hurt go about their labours as if nothing unusual were happening\r\nround about them; those whose dwellings are overturned try to repair\r\nthem, or hover distractedly in front of the ruins; but none of them\r\nseems inclined to swoop down upon the author of the damage. At most, a\r\nfew, more irritated than the rest, come at intervals and hover before\r\nmy face, confronting me at a distance of a couple of inches, and then\r\nfly away, after a few moments of this curious inspection.\r\n\r\nDespite the selection of a common site for their nests, which might\r\nsuggest an attempt at communistic interests among the Anthophorae,\r\nthese Bees, therefore, obey the egotistical law of each one for\r\nhimself and do not know how to band themselves together to repel an\r\nenemy who threatens one and all. Taken singly, the Anthophora does not\r\neven know how to dash at the enemy who is ravaging her cells and drive\r\nhim away with her stings; the pacific creature hastily leaves its\r\ndwelling when disturbed by undermining and escapes in a crippled\r\nstate, sometimes even mortally wounded, without thinking of making use\r\nof its venomous sting, except when it is seized and handled. Many\r\nother Hymenoptera, honey-gatherers or hunters, are quite as\r\nspiritless; and I can assert to-day, after a long experience, that\r\nonly the Social Hymenoptera, the Hive-bees, the Common Wasps and the\r\nBumble-bees, know how to devise a common defence; and only they dare\r\nfall singly upon the aggressor, to wreak an individual vengeance.\r\n\r\nThanks to this unexpected lack of spirit in the Mason-bee, I was able\r\nfor hours to pursue my investigations at my leisure, seated on a stone\r\nin the midst of the murmuring and distracted swarm, without receiving\r\na single sting, though I took no precautions whatever. Country-folk,\r\nhappening to pass and beholding me seated, unperturbed, in the midst\r\nof the whirl of Bees, stopped aghast to ask me whether I had bewitched\r\nthem, whether I charmed them, since I appeared to have nothing to fear\r\nfrom them:\r\n\r\n\"_Me, moun bel ami, li-z-ave doun escounjurado que vous pougnioun pas,\r\ncaneu de sort!_\"\r\n\r\nMy miscellaneous impedimenta spread over the ground, boxes, glass jars\r\nand tubes, tweezers and magnifying-glasses, were certainly regarded by\r\nthese good people as the implements of my wizardry.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to examine the cells. Some are still open and\r\ncontain only a more or less complete store of honey. Others are\r\nhermetically sealed with an earthen lid. The contents of these latter\r\nvary greatly. Sometimes we find the larva of a Bee which has finished\r\nits mess or is on the point of finishing it; sometimes a larva, white\r\nlike the first, but more corpulent and of a different shape; at other\r\ntimes honey with an egg floating on the surface. The honey is liquid\r\nand sticky, with a brownish colour and a very strong, repulsive smell.\r\nThe egg is of a beautiful white, cylindrical in shape, slightly curved\r\ninto an arc, a fifth or a sixth of an inch in length and not quite a\r\ntwenty-fifth of an inch in thickness; it is the egg of the Anthophora.\r\n\r\nIn a few cells this egg is floating all alone on the surface of the\r\nhoney; in others, very numerous these, we see, lying on the egg of the\r\nAnthophora, as on a sort of raft, a young Sitaris-grub with the shape\r\nand the dimensions which I have described above, that is to say, with\r\nthe shape and the dimensions which the creature possesses on leaving\r\nthe egg. This is the enemy within the gates.\r\n\r\nWhen and how did it get in? In none of the cells where I have observed\r\nit was I able to distinguish a fissure which could have allowed it to\r\nenter; they are all sealed in a quite irreproachable manner. The\r\nparasite therefore established itself in the honey-warehouse before\r\nthe warehouse was closed; on the other hand, the open cells, full of\r\nhoney, but as yet without the egg of the Anthophora, are always free\r\nfrom parasites. It is therefore during the laying, or afterwards, when\r\nthe Anthophora is occupied in plastering the door of the cell, that\r\nthe young larva gains admittance. It is impossible to decide by\r\nexperiment to which of these two periods we must ascribe the\r\nintroduction of the Sitares into the cell; for, however peaceable the\r\nAnthophora may be, it is evident that we cannot hope to witness what\r\nhappens in the cell at the moment when she is laying an egg or at the\r\nmoment when she is making the lid. But a few attempts will soon\r\nconvince us that the only second which would allow the Sitaris to\r\nestablish itself in the home of the Bee is the very second when the\r\negg is laid on the surface of the honey.\r\n\r\nLet us take an Anthophora-cell full of honey and furnished with an egg\r\nand, after removing the lid, place it in a glass tube with a few\r\nSitaris-grubs. The grubs do not appear at all eager for this wealth of\r\nnectar placed within their reach; they wander at random about the\r\ntube, run about the outside of the cell, sometimes happen upon the\r\nedge of the orifice and very rarely venture inside. When they do, they\r\ndo not go far in and they come out again at once. If one happens to\r\nreach the honey, which only half fills the cell, it tries to escape as\r\nsoon as it has perceived the shifting nature of the sticky soil upon\r\nwhich it was about to enter; but, tottering at every step, because of\r\nthe viscous matter clinging to its feet, it often ends by falling back\r\ninto the honey, where it dies of suffocation.\r\n\r\nAgain, we may experiment as follows: having prepared a cell as before,\r\nwe place a larva most carefully on its inner wall, or else on the\r\nsurface of the food itself. In the first case, the larva hastens to\r\nleave the cell; in the second case, it struggles awhile on the surface\r\nof the honey and ends by getting so completely caught that, after a\r\nthousand efforts to gain the shore, it is swallowed up in the viscous\r\nlake.\r\n\r\nIn short, all attempts to establish the Sitaris-grub in an\r\nAnthophora-cell provisioned with honey and furnished with an egg are\r\nno more successful than those which I made with cells whose store of\r\nfood had already been broached by the larva of the Bee, as described\r\nabove. It is therefore certain that the Sitaris-grub does not leave\r\nthe fleece of the Mason-bee when the Bee is in her cell or at the\r\nentrance to it, in order itself to make a rush for the coveted honey;\r\nfor this honey would inevitably cause its death, if it happened by\r\naccident to touch the perilous surface merely with the tip of its\r\ntarsi.\r\n\r\nSince we cannot admit that the Sitaris-grub leaves the furry corselet\r\nof its hostess to slip unseen into the cell, whose orifice is not yet\r\nwholly walled up, at the moment when the Anthophora is building her\r\ndoor, all that remains to investigate is the second at which the egg\r\nis being laid. Remember in the first place that the young Sitaris\r\nwhich we find in a closed cell is always placed on the egg of the Bee.\r\nWe shall see in a minute that this egg not merely serves as a raft for\r\nthe tiny creature floating on a very treacherous lake, but also\r\nconstitutes the first and indispensable part of its diet. To get at\r\nthis egg, situated in the centre of the lake of honey, to reach, at\r\nall costs, this raft, which is also its first ration, the young larva\r\nevidently possesses some means of avoiding the fatal contact of the\r\nhoney; and this means can be provided only by the actions of the Bee\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, observations repeated _ad nauseam_ have shown me\r\nthat at no period do we find in each invaded cell more than a single\r\nSitaris, in one or other of the forms which it successively assumes.\r\nYet there are several young larvae established in the silky tangle of\r\nthe Bee's thorax, all eagerly watching for the propitious moment at\r\nwhich to enter the dwelling in which they are to continue their\r\ndevelopment. How then does it happen that these larvae, goaded by such\r\nan appetite as one would expect after seven or eight months' complete\r\nabstinence, instead of all rushing together into the first cell within\r\nreach, on the contrary enter the various cells which the Bee is\r\nprovisioning one at a time and in perfect order? Some action must take\r\nplace here independent of the Sitares.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy those two indispensable conditions, the arrival of the\r\nlarva upon the egg without crossing the honey and the introduction of\r\na single larva among all those waiting in the fleece of the Bee, there\r\ncan be only one explanation, which is to suppose that, at the moment\r\nwhen the Anthophora's egg is half out of the oviduct, one of the\r\nSitares which have hastened from the thorax to the tip of the abdomen,\r\none more highly favoured by its position, instantly settles upon the\r\negg, a bridge too narrow for two, and with it reaches the surface of\r\nthe honey. The impossibility of otherwise fulfilling the two\r\nconditions which I have stated gives to the explanation which I am\r\noffering a degree of certainty almost equivalent to that which would\r\nbe furnished by direct observation, which is here, unfortunately,\r\nimpracticable. This presupposes, it is true, in the microscopic little\r\ncreature destined to live in a place where so many dangers threaten it\r\nfrom the first, an astonishingly rational inspiration, which adapts\r\nthe means to the end with amazing logic. But is not this the\r\ninvariable conclusion to which the study of instinct always leads us?\r\n\r\nWhen dropping her egg upon the honey, therefore, the Anthophora at the\r\nsame time deposits in her cell the mortal enemy of her race; she\r\ncarefully plasters the lid which closes the entrance to the cell; and\r\nall is done. A second cell is built beside it, probably to suffer the\r\nsame fatal doom; and so on until the more or less numerous parasites\r\nsheltered by her down are all accommodated. Let us leave the unhappy\r\nmother to continue her fruitless task and turn our attention to the\r\nyoung larva which has so adroitly secured itself board and lodging.\r\n\r\nIn opening cells whose lid is still moist, we end by discovering one\r\nin which the egg, recently laid, supports a young Sitaris. This egg is\r\nintact and in irreproachable condition. But now the work of\r\ndevastation begins: the larva, a tiny black speck which we see running\r\nover the white surface of the egg, at last stops and balances itself\r\nfirmly on its six legs; then, seizing the delicate skin of the egg\r\nwith the sharp hooks of its mandibles, it tugs at it violently until\r\nit breaks, spilling its contents, which the larva eagerly drinks up.\r\nThus the first stroke of the mandibles which the parasite delivers in\r\nthe usurped cell is aimed at the destruction of the Bee's egg. A\r\nhighly logical precaution! The Sitaris-larva, as we shall see, has to\r\nfeed upon the honey in the cell; the Anthophora-larva which would\r\nproceed from that egg would require the same food; but the portion is\r\ntoo small for two; so, quick, a bite at the egg and the difficulty\r\nwill be removed. The story of these facts calls for no comment. This\r\ndestruction of the cumbersome egg is all the more inevitable inasmuch\r\nas special tastes compel the young Sitaris-grub to make its first\r\nmeals of it. Indeed we see the tiny creature begin by greedily\r\ndrinking the juices which the torn wrapper of the egg allows to\r\nescape; and for several days it may be observed, at one time\r\nmotionless on this envelope, in which it rummages at intervals with\r\nits head, at others running over it from end to end to rip it open\r\nstill wider and to cause a little of the juices, which become daily\r\nless abundant, to trickle from it; but we never catch it imbibing the\r\nhoney which surrounds it on every side.\r\n\r\nFor that matter, it is easy to convince ourselves that the egg\r\ncombines with the function of a life-buoy that of the first ration. I\r\nhave laid on the surface of the honey in a cell a tiny strip of paper,\r\nof the same dimensions as the egg; and on this raft I have placed a\r\nSitaris-larva. Despite every care, my attempts, many times repeated,\r\nalways failed. The larva, placed in a paper boat in the centre of the\r\nmass of honey, behaves as in the earlier experiments. Not finding what\r\nsuits it, it tries to escape and perishes in the sticky toils as soon\r\nas it leaves the strip of paper, which it soon does.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we can easily rear Sitaris-grubs by taking\r\nAnthophora-cells not invaded by the parasites, cells in which the egg\r\nis not yet hatched. All that we have to do is to pick up one of these\r\ngrubs with the moistened tip of a needle and to lay it delicately on\r\nthe egg. There is then no longer the least attempt to escape. After\r\nexploring the egg to find its way about, the larva rips it open and\r\nfor several days does not stir from the spot. Henceforth its\r\ndevelopment takes place unhindered, provided that the cell be\r\nprotected from too rapid evaporation, which would dry up the honey and\r\nrender it unfit for the grub's food. The Anthophora's egg therefore is\r\nabsolutely necessary to the Sitaris-larva, not merely as a boat, but\r\nalso as its first nourishment. This is the whole secret, for lack of\r\nknowing which I had hitherto failed in my attempts to rear the larvae\r\nhatched in my glass jars.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a week, the egg, drained by the parasite, is nothing but\r\na dry skin. The first meal is finished. The Sitaris-larva, whose\r\ndimensions have almost doubled, now splits open along the back; and\r\nthrough a slit which comprises the head and the three thoracic\r\nsegments a white corpusculum, the second form of this singular\r\norganism, escapes to fall on the surface of the honey, while the\r\nabandoned slough remains clinging to the raft which has hitherto\r\nsafeguarded and fed the larva. Presently both sloughs, those of the\r\nSitaris and the egg, will disappear, submerged under the waves of\r\nhoney which the new larva is about to raise. Here ends the history of\r\nthe first form adopted by the Sitaris.\r\n\r\nIn summing up the above, we see that the strange little creature\r\nawaits, without food, for seven months, the appearance of the\r\nAnthophorae and at last fastens on to the hairs on the corselet of the\r\nmales, who are the first to emerge and who inevitably pass within its\r\nreach in going through their corridors. From the fleece of the male\r\nthe larva moves, three or four weeks later, to that of the female, at\r\nthe moment of coupling; and then from the female to the egg leaving\r\nthe oviduct. It is by this concatenation of complex manoeuvres that\r\nthe larva in the end finds itself perched upon an egg in the middle of\r\na closed cell filled with honey. These perilous gymnastics on the hair\r\nof a Bee in movement all the day, this passing from one sex to the\r\nother, this arrival in the middle of the cell by way of the egg, a\r\ndangerous bridge thrown across the sticky abyss, all this necessitates\r\nthe balancing-appliances with which it is provided and which I have\r\ndescribed above. Lastly, the destruction of the egg calls, in its\r\nturn, for a sharp pair of scissors; and such is the object of the\r\nkeen, curved mandibles. Thus the primary form of the Sitares has as\r\nits function to get itself carried by the Anthophora into the cell and\r\nto rip up her egg. This done, the organism becomes transformed to such\r\na degree that repeated observations are required to make us believe\r\nthe evidence of our eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nTHE PRIMARY LARVA OF THE OIL-BEETLES\r\n\r\n\r\nI interrupt the history of the Sitares to speak of the Meloes, those\r\nuncouth Beetles, with their clumsy belly and their limp wing-cases\r\nyawning over their back like the tails of a fat man's coat that is far\r\ntoo tight for its wearer. The insect is ugly in colouring, which is\r\nblack, with an occasional blue gleam, and uglier still in shape and\r\ngait; and its disgusting method of defence increases the repugnance\r\nwith which it inspires us. If it judges itself to be in danger, the\r\nMeloe resorts to spontaneous bleeding. From its joints a yellowish,\r\noily fluid oozes, which stains your fingers and makes them stink. This\r\nis the creature's blood. The English, because of its trick of\r\ndischarging oily blood when on the defensive, call this insect the\r\nOil-beetle. It would not be a particularly interesting Beetle save for\r\nits metamorphoses and the peregrinations of its larva, which are\r\nsimilar in every respect to those of the larva of the Sitares. In\r\ntheir first form, the Oil-beetles are parasites of the Anthophorae;\r\ntheir tiny grub, when it leaves the egg, has itself carried into the\r\ncell by the Bee whose victuals are to form its food.\r\n\r\nObserved in the down of various Bees, the queer little creature for a\r\nlong time baffled the sagacity of the naturalists, who, mistaking its\r\ntrue origin, made it a species of a special family of wingless\r\ninsects. It was the Bee-louse (_Pediculus apis_) of Linnaeus;[1] the\r\nTriungulin of the Andrenae (_Triungulinus andrenetarum_) of Leon\r\nDufour. They saw in it a parasite, a sort of Louse, living in the\r\nfleece of the honey-gatherers. It was reserved for the distinguished\r\nEnglish naturalist Newport to show that this supposed Louse was the\r\nfirst state of the Oil-beetles. Some observations of my own will fill\r\na few lacunae in the English scientist's monograph. I will therefore\r\nsketch the evolution of the Oil-beetles, using Newport's work where my\r\nown observations are defective. In this way the Sitares and the\r\nMeloes, alike in habits and transformations, will be compared; and the\r\ncomparison will throw a certain light upon the strange metamorphoses\r\nof these insects.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Carolus Linnaeus (Karl von Linne, 1707-1778), the\r\ncelebrated Swedish botanist and naturalist, founder of the Linnaean\r\nsystem of classification.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThe same Mason-bee (_Anthophora pilipes_) upon whom the Sitares live\r\nalso feeds a few scarce Meloes (_M. cicatricosus_) in its cells. A\r\nsecond Anthophora of my district (_A. parietina_) is more subject to\r\nthis parasite's invasions. It was also in the nests of an Anthophora,\r\nbut of a different species (_A. retusa_), that Newport observed the\r\nsame Oil-beetle. These three lodgings adopted by _Meloe cicatricosus_\r\nmay be of some slight interest, as leading us to suspect that each\r\nspecies of Meloe is apparently the parasite of diverse Bees, a\r\nsuspicion which will be confirmed when we examine the manner in which\r\nthe larvae reach the cell full of honey. The Sitares, though less\r\ngiven to change of lodging, are likewise able to inhabit nests of\r\ndifferent species. They are very common in the cells of _Anthophora\r\npilipes_; but I have found them also, in very small numbers, it is\r\ntrue, in the cells of _A. personata_.\r\n\r\nDespite the presence of _Meloe cicatricosus_ in the dwellings of the\r\nMason-bee, which I so often ransacked in compiling the history of the\r\nSitares, I never saw this insect, at any season of the year, wandering\r\non the perpendicular soil, at the entrance of the corridors, for the\r\npurpose of laying its eggs there, as the Sitares do; and I should know\r\nnothing of the details of the egg-laying if Godart,[2] de Geer[3] and,\r\nabove all, Newport had not informed us that the Oil-beetles lay their\r\neggs in the earth. According to the last-named author, the various\r\nOil-beetles whom he had the opportunity of observing dig, among the\r\nroots of a clump of grass, in a dry soil exposed to the sun, a hole a\r\ncouple of inches deep which they carefully fill up after laying their\r\neggs there in a heap. This laying is repeated three or four times\r\nover, at intervals of a few days during the same season. For each\r\nbatch of eggs the female digs a special hole, which she does not fail\r\nto fill up afterwards. This takes place in April and May.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Jean Baptiste Godart (1775-1823), the principal editor of\r\n_L'Histoire naturelle des lepidopteres de France_.--_Translator's\r\nNote_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Baron Karl de Geer (1720-1778), the Swedish entomologist,\r\nauthor of _Memoires pour servir a l'histoire des insectes_\r\n(1752-1778).--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThe number of eggs laid in a single batch is really prodigious. In the\r\nfirst batch, which, it is true, is the most prolific of all, _Meloe\r\nproscarabaeus_, according to Newport's calculations, produces the\r\nastonishing number of 4,218 eggs, which is double the number of eggs\r\nlaid by a Sitaris. And what must the number be, when we allow for the\r\ntwo or three batches that follow the first! The Sitares, entrusting\r\ntheir eggs to the very corridors through which the Anthophora is bound\r\nto pass, spare their larvae a host of dangers which the larvae of the\r\nMeloe have to run, for these, born far from the dwellings of the Bees,\r\nare obliged to make their own way to their hymenopterous\r\nfoster-parents. The Oil-beetles, therefore, lacking the instinct of\r\nthe Sitares, are endowed with incomparably greater fecundity. The\r\nrichness of their ovaries atones for the insufficiency of instinct by\r\nproportioning the number of germs in accordance with the risks of\r\ndestruction. What transcendent harmony is this, which thus holds the\r\nscales between the fecundity of the ovaries and the perfection of\r\ninstinct!\r\n\r\nThe hatching of the eggs takes place at the end of May or in June,\r\nabout a month after they are laid. The eggs of the Sitares also are\r\nhatched after the same lapse of time. But the Meloe-larvae, more\r\ngreatly favoured, are able to set off immediately in search of the\r\nBees that are to feed them; while those of the Sitares, hatched in\r\nSeptember, have to wait motionless and in complete abstinence for the\r\nemergence of the Anthophorae the entrance to whose cells they guard. I\r\nwill not describe the young Meloe-larva, which is sufficiently well\r\nknown, in particular by the description and the diagram furnished by\r\nNewport. To enable the reader to understand what follows, I will\r\nconfine myself to stating that this primary larva is a sort of little\r\nyellow louse, long and slender, found in the spring in the down of\r\ndifferent Bees.\r\n\r\nHow has this tiny creature made its way from the underground lodging\r\nwhere the eggs are hatched to the fleece of a Bee? Newport suspects\r\nthat the young Oil-beetles, on emerging from their natal burrow, climb\r\nupon the neighbouring plants, especially upon the Cichoriceae, and\r\nwait, concealed among the petals, until a few Bees chance to plunder\r\nthe flower, when they promptly fasten on to their fur and allow\r\nthemselves to be borne away by them. I have more than Newport's\r\nsuspicions upon this curious point; my personal observations and\r\nexperiments are absolutely convincing. I will relate them as the first\r\nphase of the history of the Bee-louse. They date back to the 23rd of\r\nMay, 1858.\r\n\r\nA vertical bank on the road from Carpentras to Bedoin is this time the\r\nscene of my observations. This bank, baked by the sun, is exploited by\r\nnumerous swarms of Anthophorae, who, more industrious than their\r\ncongeners, are in the habit of building, at the entrance to their\r\ncorridors, with serpentine fillets of earth, a vestibule, a defensive\r\nbastion in the form of an arched cylinder. In a word, they are swarms\r\nof _A. parietina_. A sparse carpet of turf extends from the edge of\r\nthe road to the foot of the bank. The more comfortably to follow the\r\nwork of the Bees, in the hope of wresting some secret from them, I had\r\nbeen lying for a few moments upon this turf, in the very heart of the\r\ninoffensive swarm, when my clothes were invaded by legions of little\r\nyellow lice, running with desperate eagerness through the hairy\r\nthickets of the nap of the cloth. In these tiny creatures, with which\r\nI was powdered here and there as with yellow dust, I soon recognized\r\nan old acquaintance, the young Oil-beetles, whom I now saw for the\r\nfirst time elsewhere than in the Bees' fur or the interior of their\r\ncells. I could not lose so excellent an opportunity of learning how\r\nthese larvae manage to establish themselves upon the bodies of their\r\nfoster-parents.\r\n\r\nIn the grass where, after lying down for a moment, I had caught these\r\nlice were a few plants in blossom, of which the most abundant were\r\nthree composites: _Hedypnois polymorpha_, _Senecio gallicus_ and\r\n_Anthemis arvensis_. Now it was on a composite, a dandelion, that\r\nNewport seemed to remember seeing some young Oil-beetles; and my\r\nattention therefore was first of all directed to the plants which I\r\nhave named. To my great satisfaction, nearly all the flowers of these\r\nthree plants, especially those of the camomile (_Anthemis_) were\r\noccupied by young Oil-beetles in greater or lesser numbers. On one\r\nhead of camomile I counted forty of these tiny insects, cowering\r\nmotionless in the centre of the florets. On the other hand, I could\r\nnot discover any on the flowers of the poppy or of a wild rocket\r\n(_Diplotaxis muralis_) which grew promiscuously among the plants\r\naforesaid. It seems to me, therefore, that it is only on the composite\r\nflowers that the Meloe-larvae await the Bees' arrival.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this population encamped upon the heads of the\r\ncomposites and remaining motionless, as though it had achieved its\r\nobject for the moment, I soon discovered yet another, far more\r\nnumerous, whose anxious activity betrayed a fruitless search. On the\r\nground, in the grass, numberless little larvae were running in a great\r\nflutter, recalling in some respects the tumultuous disorder of an\r\noverturned Ant-hill; others were hurriedly climbing to the tip of a\r\nblade of grass and descending with the same haste; others again were\r\nplunging into the downy fluff of the withered everlastings, remaining\r\nthere a moment and quickly reappearing to continue their search.\r\nLastly, with a little attention, I was able to convince myself that\r\nwithin an area of a dozen square yards there was perhaps not a single\r\nblade of grass which was not explored by several of these larvae.\r\n\r\nI was evidently witnessing the recent emergence of the young\r\nOil-beetles from their maternal lairs. Part of them had already\r\nsettled on the groundsel- and camomile-flowers to await the arrival of\r\nthe Bees; but the majority were still wandering in search of this\r\nprovisional refuge. It was by this wandering population that I had\r\nbeen invaded when I lay down at the foot of the bank. It was\r\nimpossible that all these larvae, the tale of whose alarming thousands\r\nI would not venture to define, should form one family and recognize a\r\ncommon mother; despite what Newport has told us of the Oil-beetles'\r\nastonishing fecundity, I could not believe this, so great was their\r\nmultitude.\r\n\r\nThough the green carpet was continued for a considerable distance\r\nalong the side of the road, I could not detect a single Meloe-larva\r\nelsewhere than in the few square yards lying in front of the bank\r\ninhabited by the Mason-bee. These larvae therefore could not have come\r\nfar; to find themselves near the Anthophorae they had had no long\r\npilgrimage to make, for there was not a sign of the inevitable\r\nstragglers and laggards that follow in the wake of a travelling\r\ncaravan. The burrows in which the eggs were hatched were therefore in\r\nthat turf opposite the Bees' abode. Thus the Oil-beetles, far from\r\nlaying their eggs at random, as their wandering life might lead one to\r\nsuppose, and leaving their young to the task of approaching their\r\nfuture home, are able to recognize the spots haunted by the\r\nAnthophorae and lay their eggs in the near neighbourhood of those\r\nspots.\r\n\r\nWith such a multitude of parasites occupying the composite flowers in\r\nclose proximity to the Anthophora's nests, it is impossible that the\r\nmajority of the swarm should not become infested sooner or later. At\r\nthe time of my observations, a comparatively tiny proportion of the\r\nstarving legion was waiting on the flowers; the others were still\r\nwandering on the ground, where the Anthophorae very rarely alight; and\r\nyet I detected the presence of several Meloe-larvae in the thoracic\r\ndown of nearly all the Anthophorae which I caught and examined.\r\n\r\nI have also found them on the bodies of the Melecta- and\r\nCoelioxys-bees,[4] who are parasitic on the Anthophorae. Suspending\r\ntheir audacious patrolling before the galleries under construction,\r\nthese spoilers of the victualled cells alight for an instant on a\r\ncamomile-flower and lo, the thief is robbed! A tiny, imperceptible\r\nlouse has slipped into the thick of the downy fur and, at the moment\r\nwhen the parasite, after destroying the Anthophora's egg, is laying\r\nher own upon the stolen honey, will creep upon this egg, destroy it in\r\nits turn and remain sole mistress of the provisions. The mess of honey\r\namassed by the Anthophora will thus pass through the hands of three\r\nowners and remain finally the property of the weakest of the three.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Cf. _The Mason-bees_: chaps. viii. and ix.--_Translator's\r\nNote_.]\r\n\r\nAnd who shall say whether the Meloe, in its turn, will not be\r\ndispossessed by a fresh thief; or even whether it will not, in the\r\nstate of a drowsy, fat and flabby larva, fall a prey to some marauder\r\nwho will munch its live entrails? As we meditate upon this deadly,\r\nimplacable struggle which nature imposes, for their preservation, on\r\nthese different creatures, which are by turns possessors and\r\ndispossessed, devourers and devoured, a painful impression mingles\r\nwith the wonder aroused by the means employed by each parasite to\r\nattain its end; and, forgetting for a moment the tiny world in which\r\nthese things happen, we are seized with terror at this concatenation\r\nof larceny, cunning and brigandage which forms part, alas, of the\r\ndesigns of _alma parens rerum_!\r\n\r\nThe young Meloe-larvae established in the down of the Anthophorae or\r\nin that of the Melecta- and the Coelioxys-bees, their parasites, had\r\nadopted an infallible means of sooner or later reaching the desired\r\ncell. Was it, so far as they were concerned, a choice dictated by the\r\nforesight of instinct, or just simply the result of a lucky chance?\r\nThe question was soon decided. Various Flies--Drone-flies and\r\nBluebottles (_Eristalis tenax_ and _Calliphora vomitoria_)--would\r\nsettle from time to time on the groundsel- or camomile-flowers\r\noccupied by the young Meloes and stop for a moment to suck the sweet\r\nsecretions. On all these Flies, with very few exceptions, I found\r\nMeloe-larvae, motionless in the silky down of the thorax. I may also\r\nmention, as infested by these larvae, an Ammophila (_A. hirsuta_),[5]\r\nwho victuals her burrows with a caterpillar in early spring, while her\r\nkinswomen build their nests in autumn. This Wasp merely grazes, so to\r\nspeak, the surface of a flower; I catch her; there are Meloes moving\r\nabout her body. It is clear that neither the Drone-flies nor the\r\nBluebottles, whose larvae live in putrefying matter, nor yet the\r\nAmmophilae who victual theirs with caterpillars, could ever have\r\ncarried the larvae which invaded them into cells filled with honey.\r\nThese larvae therefore had gone astray; and instinct, as does not\r\noften happen, was here at fault.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: For the Wasp known as the Hairy Ammophila, who feeds her\r\nyoung on the Grey Worm, the caterpillar of the Turnip Moth, cf. _The\r\nHunting Wasps_, chaps. xviii. to xx.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nLet us now turn our attention to the young Meloes waiting expectant\r\nupon the camomile-flowers. There they are, ten, fifteen or more,\r\nlodged half-way down the florets of a single blossom or in their\r\ninterstices; it therefore needs a certain degree of scrutiny to\r\nperceive them, their hiding-place being the more effectual in that the\r\namber colour of their bodies merges in the yellow hue of the florets.\r\nSo long as nothing unusual happens upon the flower, so long as no\r\nsudden shock announces the arrival of a strange visitor, the Meloes\r\nremain absolutely motionless and give no sign of life. To see them\r\ndipping vertically, head downwards, into the florets, one might\r\nsuppose that they were seeking some sweet liquid, their food; but in\r\nthat case they ought to pass more frequently from one floret to\r\nanother, which they do not, except when, after a false alarm, they\r\nregain their hiding-places and choose the spot which seems to them the\r\nmost favourable. This immobility means that the florets of the\r\ncamomile serve them only as a place of ambush, even as later the\r\nAnthophora's body will serve them solely as a vehicle to convey them\r\nto the Bee's cell. They take no nourishment, either on the flowers or\r\non the Bees; and, as with the Sitares, their first meal will consist\r\nof the Anthophora's egg, which the hooks of their mandibles are\r\nintended to rip open.\r\n\r\nTheir immobility is, as we have said, complete; but nothing is easier\r\nthan to arouse their suspended activity. Shake a camomile-blossom\r\nlightly with a bit of straw: instantly the Meloes leave their\r\nhiding-places, come up and scatter in all directions on the white\r\npetals of the circumference, running over them from one end to the\r\nother with all the speed which the smallness of their size permits. On\r\nreaching the extreme end of the petals, they fasten to it either with\r\ntheir caudal appendages, or perhaps with a sticky substance similar to\r\nthat furnished by the anal button of the Sitares; and, with their\r\nbodies hanging outside and their six legs free, they bend about in\r\nevery direction and stretch as far out as they can, as though striving\r\nto touch an object out of their reach. If nothing offers for them to\r\nseize upon, after a few vain attempts they regain the centre of the\r\nflower and soon resume their immobility.\r\n\r\nBut, if we place near them any object whatever, they do not fail to\r\ncatch on to it with surprising agility. A blade of grass, a bit of\r\nstraw, the handle of my tweezers which I hold out to them: they accept\r\nanything in their eagerness to quit the provisional shelter of the\r\nflower. It is true that, after finding themselves on these inanimate\r\nobjects, they soon recognize that they have gone astray, as we see by\r\ntheir bustling movements to and fro and their tendency to go back to\r\nthe flower if there still be time. Those which have thus giddily flung\r\nthemselves upon a bit of straw and are allowed to return to their\r\nflower do not readily fall a second time into the same trap. There is\r\ntherefore, in these animated specks, a memory, an experience of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nAfter these experiments I tried others with hairy materials imitating\r\nmore or less closely the down of the Bees, with little pieces of cloth\r\nor velvet cut from my clothes, with plugs of cotton wool, with pellets\r\nof flock gathered from the everlastings. Upon all these objects,\r\noffered with the tweezers, the Meloes flung themselves without any\r\ndifficulty; but, instead of keeping quiet, as they do on the bodies of\r\nthe Bees, they soon convinced me, by their restless behaviour, that\r\nthey found themselves as much out of their element on these furry\r\nmaterials as on the smooth surface of a bit of straw. I ought to have\r\nexpected this: had I not just seen them wandering without pause upon\r\nthe everlastings enveloped with cottony flock? If reaching the shelter\r\nof a downy surface were enough to make them believe themselves safe in\r\nharbour, nearly all would perish, without further attempts, in the\r\ndown of the plants.\r\n\r\nLet us now offer them live insects and, first of all, Anthophorae. If\r\nthe Bee, after we have rid her of the parasites which she may be\r\ncarrying, be taken by the wings and held for a moment in contact with\r\nthe flower, we invariably find her, after this rapid contact, overrun\r\nby Meloes clinging to her hairs. The larvae nimbly take up their\r\nposition on the thorax, usually on the shoulders or sides, and once\r\nthere they remain motionless: the second stage of their strange\r\njourney is compassed.\r\n\r\nAfter the Anthophorae, I tried the first live insects that I was able\r\nto procure at once: Drone-flies, Bluebottles, Hive-bees, small\r\nButterflies. All were alike overrun by the Meloes, without hesitation.\r\nWhat is more, there was no attempt made to return to the flowers. As I\r\ncould not find any Beetles at the moment, I was unable to experiment\r\nwith them. Newport, experimenting, it is true, under conditions very\r\ndifferent from mine, since his observations related to young Meloes\r\nheld captive in a glass jar, while mine were made in the normal\r\ncircumstances, Newport, I was saying, saw Meloes fasten to the body of\r\na Malachius and stay there without moving, which inclines me to\r\nbelieve that with Beetles I should have obtained the same results as,\r\nfor instance, with a Drone-fly. And I did, in fact, at a later date,\r\nfind some Meloe-larvae on the body of a big Beetle, the Golden\r\nRose-chafer (_Cetonia aurata_), an assiduous visitor of the flowers.\r\n\r\nAfter exhausting the insect class, I put within their reach my last\r\nresource, a large black Spider. Without hesitation they passed from\r\nthe flower to the arachnid, made for places near the joints of the\r\nlegs and settled there without moving. Everything therefore seems to\r\nsuit their plans for leaving the provisional abode where they are\r\nwaiting; without distinction of species, genus, or class, they fasten\r\nto the first living creature that chance brings within their reach. We\r\nnow understand how it is that these young larvae have been observed\r\nupon a host of different insects and especially upon the early Flies\r\nand Bees pillaging the flowers; we can also understand the need for\r\nthat prodigious number of eggs laid by a single Oil-beetle, since the\r\nvast majority of the larvae which come out of them will infallibly go\r\nastray and will not succeed in reaching the cells of the Anthophorae.\r\nInstinct is at fault here; and fecundity makes up for it.\r\n\r\nBut instinct recovers its infallibility in another case. The Meloes,\r\nas we have seen, pass without difficulty from the flower to the\r\nobjects within their reach, whatever these may be, smooth or hairy,\r\nliving or inanimate. This done, they behave very differently,\r\naccording as they have chanced to invade the body of an insect or some\r\nother object. In the first case, on a downy Fly or Butterfly, on a\r\nsmooth-skinned Spider or Beetle, the larvae remain motionless after\r\nreaching the point which suits them. Their instinctive desire is\r\ntherefore satisfied. In the second case, in the midst of the nap of\r\ncloth or velvet, or the filaments of cotton, or the flock of the\r\neverlasting, or, lastly, on the smooth surface of a leaf or a straw,\r\nthey betray the knowledge of their mistake by their continual coming\r\nand going, by their efforts to return to the flower imprudently\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nHow then do they recognize the nature of the object to which they have\r\njust moved? How is it that this object, whatever the quality of its\r\nsurface, will sometimes suit them and sometimes not? Do they judge\r\ntheir new lodging by sight? But then no mistake would be possible; the\r\nsense of sight would tell them at the outset whether the object within\r\nreach was suitable or not; and emigration would or would not take\r\nplace according to its decision. And then how can we suppose that,\r\nburied in the dense thicket of a pellet of cotton-wool or in the\r\nfleece of an Anthophora, the imperceptible larva can recognize, by\r\nsight, the enormous mass which it is perambulating?\r\n\r\nIs it by touch, by some sensation due to the inner vibrations of\r\nliving flesh? Not so, for the Meloes remain motionless on insect\r\ncorpses that have dried up completely, on dead Anthophorae taken from\r\ncells at least a year old. I have seen them keep absolutely quiet on\r\nfragments of an Anthophora on a thorax long since nibbled and emptied\r\nby the Mites. By what sense then can they distinguish the thorax of an\r\nAnthophora from a velvety pellet, when sight and touch are out of the\r\nquestion? The sense of smell remains. But in that case what exquisite\r\nsubtlety must we not take for granted? Moreover, what similarity of\r\nsmell can we admit between all the insects which, dead or alive, whole\r\nor in pieces, fresh or dried, suit the Meloes, while anything else\r\ndoes not suit them? A wretched louse, a living speck, leaves us\r\nmightily perplexed as to the sensibility which directs it. Here is yet\r\none more riddle added to all the others.\r\n\r\nAfter the observations which I have described, it remained for me to\r\nsearch the earthen surface inhabited by the Anthophorae: I should then\r\nhave followed the Meloe-larva in its transformations. It was certainly\r\n_cicatricosus_ whose larvae I had been studying; it was certainly this\r\ninsect which ravaged the cells of the Mason-bee, for I found it dead\r\nin the old galleries which it had been unable to leave. This\r\nopportunity, which did not occur again, promised me an ample harvest.\r\nI had to give it all up. My Thursday was drawing to a close; I had to\r\nreturn to Avignon, to resume my lessons on the electrophorus and the\r\nToricellian tube. O happy Thursdays! What glorious opportunities I\r\nlost because you were too short!\r\n\r\nWe will go back a year to continue this history. I collected, under\r\nfar less favourable conditions, it is true, enough notes to map out\r\nthe biography of the tiny creature which we have just seen migrating\r\nfrom the camomile-flowers to the Anthophora's back. From what I have\r\nsaid of the Sitaris-larvae, it is plain that the Meloe-larvae perched,\r\nlike the former, on the back of a Bee, have but one aim: to get\r\nthemselves conveyed by this Bee to the victualled cells. Their object\r\nis not to live for a time on the body that carries them.\r\n\r\nWere it necessary to prove this, it would be enough to say that we\r\nnever see these larvae attempt to pierce the skin of the Bee, or else\r\nto nibble at a hair or two, nor do we see them increase in size so\r\nlong as they are on the Bee's body. To the Meloes, as to the Sitares,\r\nthe Anthophora serves merely as a vehicle which conveys them to their\r\ngoal, the victualled cell.\r\n\r\nIt remains for us to learn how the Meloe leaves the down of the Bee\r\nwhich has carried it, in order to enter the cell. With larvae\r\ncollected from the bodies of different Bees, before I was fully\r\nacquainted with the tactics of the Sitares, I undertook, as Newport\r\nhad done before me, certain investigations intended to throw light on\r\nthis leading point in the Oil-beetle's history. My attempts, based\r\nupon those which I had made with the Sitares, resulted in the same\r\nfailure. The tiny creatures, when brought into contact with\r\nAnthophora-larvae or -nymphs, paid no attention whatever to their\r\nprey; others, placed near cells which were open and full of honey, did\r\nnot enter them, or at most ventured to the edge of the orifice;\r\nothers, lastly, put inside the cell, on the dry wall or on the surface\r\nof the honey, came out again immediately or else got stuck and died.\r\nThe touch of the honey is as fatal to them as to the young Sitares.\r\n\r\nSearches made at various periods in the nests of the Hairy-footed\r\nAnthophora had taught me some years earlier that _Meloe cicatricosus_,\r\nlike the Sitares, is a parasite of that Bee; indeed I had at different\r\ntimes discovered adult Meloes, dead and shrivelled, in the Bee's\r\ncells. On the other hand, I knew from Leon Dufour that the little\r\nyellow animal, the Louse found in the Bee's down, had been recognized,\r\nthanks to Newport's investigations, as the larva of the Oil-beetle.\r\nWith these data, rendered still more striking by what I was learning\r\ndaily on the subject of the Sitares, I went to Carpentras, on the 21st\r\nof May, to inspect the nests of the Anthophorae, then building, as I\r\nhave described. Though I was almost certain of succeeding, sooner or\r\nlater, with the Sitares, who were excessively abundant, I had very\r\nlittle hope of the Meloes, which on the contrary are very scarce in\r\nthe same nests. Circumstances, however, favoured me more than I dared\r\nhope and, after six hours' labour, in which the pick played a great\r\npart, I became the possessor, by the sweat of my brow, of a\r\nconsiderable number of cells occupied by Sitares and two other cells\r\nappropriated by Meloes.\r\n\r\nWhile my enthusiasm had not had time to cool at the sight, momentarily\r\nrepeated, of a young Sitaris perched upon an Anthophora's egg floating\r\nin the centre of the little pool of honey, it might well have burst\r\nall restraints on beholding the contents of one of these cells. On the\r\nblack, liquid honey a wrinkled pellicle is floating; and on this\r\npellicle, motionless, is a yellow louse. The pellicle is the empty\r\nenvelope of the Anthophora's egg; the louse is a Meloe-larva.\r\n\r\nThe story of this larva becomes self-evident. The young Meloe leaves\r\nthe down of the Bee at the moment when the egg is laid; and, since\r\ncontact with the honey would be fatal to the grub, it must, in order\r\nto save itself, adopt the tactics followed by the Sitaris, that is to\r\nsay, it must allow itself to drop on the surface of the honey with the\r\negg which is in the act of being laid. There, its first task is to\r\ndevour the egg which serves it for a raft, as is attested by the empty\r\nenvelope on which it still remains; and it is after this meal, the\r\nonly one that it takes so long as it retains its present form, that it\r\nmust commence its long series of transformations and feed upon the\r\nhoney amassed by the Anthophora. This was the reason of the complete\r\nfailure both of my attempts and of Newport's to rear the young\r\nMeloe-larvae. Instead of offering them honey, or larvae, or nymphs, we\r\nshould have placed them on the eggs recently laid by the Anthophora.\r\n\r\nOn my return from Carpentras, I meant to try this method, together\r\nwith that of the Sitares, with which I had been so successful; but, as\r\nI had no Meloe-larvae at my disposal and could not obtain any save by\r\nsearching for them in the Bees' fleece, the Anthophora-eggs were all\r\ndiscovered to have hatched in the cells which I brought back from my\r\nexpedition, when I was at last able to find some. This lost experiment\r\nis little to be regretted, for, since the Meloes and the Sitares\r\nexhibiting the completest similarity not only in habits but also in\r\ntheir method of evolution, there is no doubt whatever that I should\r\nhave succeeded. I even believe that this method may be attempted with\r\nthe cells of various Bees, provided that the eggs and the honey do not\r\ndiffer too greatly from the Anthophora's. I should not, for example,\r\ncount on being successful with the cells of the three-horned Osmia,\r\nwho shares the Anthophora's quarters: her egg is short and thick; and\r\nher honey is yellow, odourless, solid, almost a powder and very\r\nfaintly flavoured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nHYPERMETAMORPHOSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nBy a Machiavellian stratagem the primary larva of the Oil-beetle or\r\nthe Sitaris has penetrated the Anthophora's cell; it has settled on\r\nthe egg, which is its first food and its life-raft in one. What\r\nbecomes of it once the egg is exhausted?\r\n\r\nLet us, to begin with, go back to the larva of the Sitaris. By the end\r\nof a week the Anthophora's egg has been drained dry by the parasite\r\nand is reduced to the envelope, a shallow skiff which preserves the\r\ntiny creature from the deadly contact of the honey. It is on this\r\nskiff that the first transformation takes place, whereafter the larva,\r\nwhich is now organized to live in a glutinous environment, drops off\r\nthe raft into the pool of honey and leaves its empty skin, split along\r\nthe back, clinging to the pellicle of the egg. At this stage we see\r\nfloating motionless on the honey a milk-white atom, oval, flat and a\r\ntwelfth of an inch long. This is the larva of the Sitaris in its new\r\nform. With the aid of a lens we can distinguish the fluctuations of\r\nthe digestive canal, which is gorging itself with honey; and along the\r\ncircumference of the flat, elliptical back we perceive a double row of\r\nbreathing-pores which, thanks to their position, cannot be choked by\r\nthe viscous liquid. Before describing the larva in detail we will wait\r\nfor it to attain its full development, which cannot take long, for the\r\nprovisions are rapidly diminishing.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity however is not to be compared with that with which the\r\ngluttonous larvae of the Anthophora consume their food. Thus, on\r\nvisiting the dwellings of the Anthophorae for the last time, on the\r\n25th of June, I found that the Bee's larvae had all finished their\r\nrations and attained their full development, whereas those of the\r\nSitares, still immersed in the honey, were, for the most part, only\r\nhalf the size which they must finally attain. This is yet another\r\nreason why the Sitares should destroy an egg which, were it to\r\ndevelop, would produce a voracious larva, capable of starving them in\r\na very short time. When rearing the larvae myself in test-tubes, I\r\nhave found that the Sitares take thirty-five to forty days to finish\r\ntheir mess of honey and that the larvae of the Anthophora spend less\r\nthan a fortnight over the same meal.\r\n\r\nIt is in the first half of July that the Sitaris-grubs reach their\r\nfull dimensions. At this period the cell usurped by the parasite\r\ncontains nothing beyond a full-fed larva and, in a corner, a heap of\r\nreddish droppings. This larva is soft and white, about half an inch in\r\nlength and a quarter of an inch wide at its broadest part. Seen from\r\nabove as it floats on the honey, it is elliptical in form, tapering\r\ngradually towards the front and more suddenly towards the rear. Its\r\nventral surface is highly convex; its dorsal surface, on the contrary,\r\nis almost flat. When the larva is floating on the liquid honey, it is\r\nas it were steadied by the excessive development of the ventral\r\nsurface immersed in the honey, which enables it to acquire an\r\nequilibrium that is of the greatest importance to its welfare. In\r\nfact, the breathing-holes, arranged without means of protection on\r\neither edge of the almost flat back, are level with the viscous liquid\r\nand would be choked by that sticky glue at the least false movement,\r\nif a suitably ballasted hold did not prevent the larva from heeling\r\nover. Never was corpulent abdomen of greater use: thanks to this\r\nplumpness of the belly the larva is protected from asphyxia.\r\n\r\nIts segments number thirteen, including the head. This head is pale,\r\nsoft, like the rest of the body, and very small compared with the rest\r\nof the creature. The antennae are excessively short and consist of two\r\ncylindrical joints. I have vainly looked for the eyes with a powerful\r\nmagnifying-glass. In its former state, the larva, subject to strange\r\nmigrations, obviously needs the sense of sight and is provided with\r\nfour ocelli. In its present state, of what use would eyes be to it at\r\nthe bottom of a clay cell, where the most absolute darkness prevails?\r\n\r\nThe labrum is prominent, is not distinctly divided from the head, is\r\ncurved in front and edged with pale and very fine bristles. The\r\nmandibles are small, reddish toward the tips, blunt and hollowed out\r\nspoonwise on the inner side. Below the mandibles is a fleshy part\r\ncrowned with two very tiny nipples. This is the lower lip with its two\r\npalpi. It is flanked right and left by two other parts, likewise\r\nfleshy, adhering closely to the lip and bearing at the tip a\r\nrudimentary palp consisting of two or three very tiny joints. These\r\ntwo parts are the future jaws. All this apparatus of lips and jaws is\r\ncompletely immobile and in a rudimentary condition which is difficult\r\nto describe. They are budding organs, still faint and embryonic. The\r\nlabrum and the complicated lamina formed by the lip and the jaws leave\r\nbetween them a narrow slit in which the mandibles work.\r\n\r\nThe legs are merely vestiges, for, though they consist of three tiny\r\ncylindrical joints, they are barely a fiftieth of an inch in length.\r\nThe creature is unable to make use of them, not only in the liquid\r\nhoney upon which it lives, but even on a solid surface. If we take the\r\nlarva from the cell and place it on a hard substance, to observe it\r\nmore readily, we see that the inordinate protuberance of the abdomen,\r\nby lifting the thorax from the ground, prevents the legs from finding\r\na support. Lying on its side, the only possible position because of\r\nits conformation, the larva remains motionless or only makes a few\r\nlazy, wriggling movements of the abdomen, without ever stirring its\r\nfeeble limbs, which for that matter could not assist it in any way. In\r\nshort, the tiny creature of the first stage, so active and alert, is\r\nsucceeded by a ventripotent grub, deprived of movement by its very\r\nobesity. Who would recognize in this clumsy, flabby, blind, hideously\r\npot-bellied creature, with nothing but a sort of stumps for legs, the\r\nelegant pigmy of but a little while back, armour-clad, slender and\r\nprovided with highly perfected organs for performing its perilous\r\njourneys?\r\n\r\nLastly, we count nine pairs of stigmata: one pair on the mesothorax\r\nand the rest on the first eight segments of the abdomen. The last\r\npair, that on the eighth abdominal segment, consists of stigmata so\r\nsmall that to detect them we have to gather their position by that in\r\nthe succeeding states of the larva and to pass a very patient\r\nmagnifying-glass along the direction of the other pairs. These are as\r\nyet but vestigial stigmata. The others are fairly large, with pale,\r\nround, flat edges.\r\n\r\nIf in its first form the Sitaris-larva is organized for action, to\r\nobtain possession of the coveted cell, in its second form it is\r\norganized solely to digest the provisions acquired. Let us take a\r\nglance at its internal structure and in particular at its digestive\r\napparatus. Here is a strange thing: this apparatus, in which the hoard\r\nof honey amassed by the Anthophora is to be engulfed, is similar in\r\nevery respect to that of the adult Sitaris, who possibly never takes\r\nfood. We find in both the same very short oesophagus, the same\r\nchylific ventricle, empty in the perfect insect, distended in the\r\nlarva with an abundant orange-coloured pulp; in both the same\r\ngall-bladders, four in number, connected with the rectum by one of\r\ntheir extremities. Like the perfect insect, the larva is devoid of\r\nsalivary glands or any other similar apparatus. Its nervous system\r\ncomprises eleven ganglia, not counting the oesophageal collar, whereas\r\nin the perfect insect there are only seven: three for the thorax, of\r\nwhich the last two are contiguous, and four for the abdomen.\r\n\r\nWhen its rations are finished the larva remains a few days in a\r\nmotionless condition, ejecting from time to time a few reddish\r\ndroppings until the digestive canal is completely cleared of its\r\norange-coloured pulp. Then the creature contracts itself, huddles\r\nitself together; and before long we see coming detached from its body\r\na transparent, slightly crumpled and extremely fine pellicle, forming\r\na closed bag, in which the successive transformations will take place\r\nhenceforth. On this epidermal bag, this sort of transparent leather\r\nbottle, formed by the larva's skin detached all of a piece, without a\r\nslit of any kind, we can distinguish the several well-preserved\r\nexternal organs: the head, with its antennae, mandibles, paws and\r\npalpi; the thoracic segments, with their vestiges of legs; the\r\nabdomen, with its chain of breathing-holes still connected one to\r\nanother by tracheal threads.\r\n\r\nThen beneath this pellicle, which is so delicate that it can hardly\r\nbear the most cautious touch, we see a soft, white mass taking shape,\r\na mass which in a few hours acquires a firm, horny consistency and a\r\nvivid yellow hue. The transformation is now complete. Let us tear the\r\nfine gauze bag enclosing the organism which has just come into being\r\nand direct our investigation to this third form of the Sitaris-larva.\r\n\r\nIt is an inert, segmented body, with an oval outline, a horny\r\nconsistency, just like that of pupae and chrysalids, and a\r\nbright-yellow colour, which we can best describe by likening it to\r\nthat of a lemon-drop. Its upper surface forms a double inclined plane\r\nwith a very blunt ridge; its lower surface is at first flat, but, as\r\nthe result of evaporation, becomes more concave daily, leaving a\r\nprojecting rim all around its oval outline. Lastly, its two\r\nextremities or poles are slightly flattened. The major axis of the\r\nlower surface averages half an inch in length and the minor axis a\r\nquarter of an inch.\r\n\r\nAt the cephalic pole of this body is a sort of mask, modelled roughly\r\non the head of the larva, and at the opposite pole a small circular\r\ndisk deeply wrinkled at the centre. The three segments that come after\r\nthe head bear each a pair of very minute knobs, hardly visible without\r\nthe lens: these are, to the legs of the larva in its previous form,\r\nwhat the cephalic mask is to the head of the same larva. They are not\r\norgans, but indications, landmarks placed at the points where these\r\norgans will appear later. On either side we count nine stigmata, set\r\nas before on the mesothorax and the first eight abdominal segments.\r\nThe first eight breathing-holes are dark brown and stand out plainly\r\nagainst the yellow colour of the body. They consist of small, shiny,\r\nconical knobs, perforated at the top with a round hole. The ninth\r\nstigma, though fashioned like the others, is ever so much smaller; it\r\ncannot be distinguished without the lens.\r\n\r\nThe anomaly, already so manifest in the change from the first form to\r\nthe second, becomes even more so here; and we do not know what name to\r\ngive to an organism without a standard of comparison, not only in the\r\norder of Beetles, but in the whole class of insects. While, on the one\r\nhand, this organism offers many points of resemblance to the pupae of\r\nthe Flies in its horny consistency, in the complete immobility of its\r\nvarious segments, in the all but absolute absence of relief which\r\nwould enable one to distinguish the parts of the perfect insect;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, it approximates to the chrysalids, because\r\nthe creature, to attain this condition, has to shed its skin, as the\r\ncaterpillars do, it differs from the pupa because it has for covering\r\nnot the surface skin, which has become horny, but rather one of the\r\ninner skins of the larva; and it differs from the chrysalids by the\r\nabsence of mouldings which in the latter betray the appendages of the\r\nperfect insect. Lastly, it differs yet more profoundly from the pupa\r\nand the chrysalis because from both these organisms the perfect insect\r\nsprings straightway, whereas that which follows what we are\r\nconsidering is simply a larva like that which went before. I shall\r\nsuggest, to denote this curious organism, the term _pseudochrysalis_;\r\nand I shall reserve the names _primary larva_, _secondary larva_ and\r\n_tertiary larva_ to denote, in a couple of words, each of the three\r\nforms under which the Sitares possess all the characteristics of\r\nlarvae.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Sitaris, on assuming the form of the pseudochrysalis, is\r\ntransfigured outwardly to the point of baffling the science of\r\nentomological phases, this is not so inwardly. I have at every season\r\nof the year examined the viscera of the pseudochrysalids, which\r\ngenerally remain stationary for a whole year, and I have never\r\nobserved other forms among their organs than those which we find in\r\nthe secondary larva. The nervous system has undergone no change. The\r\ndigestive apparatus is absolutely void and, because of its emptiness,\r\nappears only as a thin cord, sunk, lost amid the adipose sacs. The\r\nstercoral intestine has more substance; its outlines are better\r\ndefined. The four gall-bladders are always perfectly distinct. The\r\nadipose tissue is more abundant than ever: it forms by itself the\r\nwhole contents of the pseudochrysalis, for in the matter of volume the\r\ninsignificant threads of the nervous system and the digestive\r\napparatus count for nothing. It is the reserve upon which life must\r\ndraw for its future labours.\r\n\r\nA few Sitares remain hardly a month in the pseudochrysalis stage. The\r\nother phases are achieved in the course of August; and at the\r\nbeginning of September the insect attains the perfect state. But as a\r\nrule the development is slower; the pseudochrysalis goes through the\r\nwinter; and it is not, at the earliest, until June in the second year\r\nthat the final transformations take place. Let us pass in silence over\r\nthis long period of repose, during which the Sitaris, in the form of a\r\npseudochrysalis, slumbers at the bottom of its cell, in a sleep as\r\nlethargic as that of a germ in its egg, and come to the months of June\r\nand July in the following year, the period of what we might call a\r\nsecond hatching.\r\n\r\nThe pseudochrysalis is still enclosed in the delicate pouch formed of\r\nthe skin of the secondary larva. Outside, nothing fresh has happened;\r\nbut important changes have taken place inside. I have said that the\r\npseudochrysalis displayed an upper surface arched like a hog's back\r\nand a lower surface at first flat and then more and more concave. The\r\nsides of the double inclined plane of the upper or dorsal surface also\r\nshare in this depression occasioned by the evaporation of the fluid\r\nconstituents; and a time comes when these sides are so depressed that\r\na section of the pseudochrysalis through a plane perpendicular to its\r\naxis would be represented by a curvilinear triangle with blunted\r\ncorners and inwardly convex sides. This is the appearance displayed by\r\nthe pseudochrysalis during the winter and spring.\r\n\r\nBut in June it has lost this withered appearance; it represents a\r\nperfect balloon, an ellipsoid of which the sections perpendicular to\r\nthe major axis are circles. Something has also come to pass of greater\r\nimportance than this expansion, which may be compared with that which\r\nwe obtain by blowing into a wrinkled bladder. The horny integuments of\r\nthe pseudochrysalis have become detached from their contents, all of a\r\npiece, without a break, just as happened the year before with the skin\r\nof the secondary larva; and they thus form a fresh vesicular envelope,\r\nfree from any adhesion to the contents and itself enclosed in the\r\npouch formed of the secondary larva's skin. Of these two bags without\r\noutlet, one of which is enclosed within the other, the outer is\r\ntransparent, flexible, colourless and extremely delicate; the second\r\nis brittle, almost as delicate as the first, but much less translucent\r\nbecause of its yellow colouring, which makes it resemble a thin flake\r\nof amber. On this second sac are found the stigmatic warts, the\r\nthoracic studs and so forth, which we noted on the pseudochrysalis.\r\nLastly, within its cavity we catch a glimpse of something the shape of\r\nwhich at once recalls to mind the secondary larva.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, if we tear the double envelope which protects this\r\nmystery, we recognize, not without astonishment, that we have before\r\nour eyes a new larva similar to the secondary. After one of the\r\nstrangest transformations, the creature has gone back to its second\r\nform. To describe the new larva is unnecessary, for it differs from\r\nthe former in only a few slight details. In both there is the same\r\nhead, with its various appendages barely outlined; the same vestiges\r\nof legs, the same stumps transparent as crystal. The tertiary larva\r\ndiffers from the secondary only by its abdomen, which is less fat,\r\nowing to the absolute emptiness of the digestive apparatus; by a\r\ndouble chain of fleshy cushions extending along each side; by the rim\r\nof the stigmata, crystalline and slightly projecting, but less so than\r\nin the pseudochrysalis; by the ninth pair of breathing-holes, hitherto\r\nrudimentary but now almost as large as the rest; lastly by the\r\nmandibles ending in a very sharp point. Evicted from its twofold\r\nsheath, the tertiary larva makes only very lazy movements of\r\ncontraction and dilation, without being able to advance, without even\r\nbeing able to maintain its normal position, because of the weakness of\r\nits legs. It usually remains motionless, lying on its side, or else\r\ndisplays its drowsy activity merely by feeble, wormlike movements.\r\n\r\nBy dint of these alternate contractions and dilations, indolent though\r\nthey be, the larva nevertheless contrives to turn right round in the\r\nsort of shell with which the pseudochrysalidal integuments provide it,\r\nwhen by accident it finds itself placed head downwards; and this\r\noperation is all the more difficult inasmuch as the larva almost\r\nexactly fills the cavity of the shell. The creature contracts, bends\r\nits head under its belly and slides its front half over its hinder\r\nhalf by wormlike movements so slow that the lens can hardly detect\r\nthem. In less than a quarter of an hour the larva, at first turned\r\nupside down, finds itself again head uppermost. I admire this\r\ngymnastic feat, but have some difficulty in understanding it, so small\r\nis the space which the larva, when at rest in its cell, leaves\r\nunoccupied, compared with that which we should be justified in\r\nexpecting from the possibility of such a reversal. The larva does not\r\nlong enjoy the privilege which enables it to resume inside its cell,\r\nwhen this is moved from its original position, the attitude which it\r\nprefers, that is to say, with its head up.\r\n\r\nTwo days, at most, after its first appearance it relapses into an\r\ninertia as complete as that of the pseudochrysalis. On removing it\r\nfrom its amber shell, we see that its faculty of contracting or\r\ndilating at will is so completely paralysed that the stimulus of a\r\nneedle is unable to provoke it, though the integuments have retained\r\nall their flexibility and though no perceptible change has occurred in\r\nthe organization. The irritability, therefore, which in the\r\npseudochrysalis is suspended for a whole year, reawakens for a moment,\r\nto relapse instantly into the deepest torpor. This torpor will be\r\npartly dispelled only at the moment of the passing into the nymphal\r\nstage, to return immediately afterwards and last until the insect\r\nattains the perfect state.\r\n\r\nFurther, on holding larvae of the third form, or nymphs enclosed in\r\ntheir cells, in an inverted position, in glass tubes, we never see\r\nthem regain an erect position, however long we continue the\r\nexperiment. The perfect insect itself, during the time that it is\r\nenclosed in the shell, cannot regain it, for lack of the requisite\r\nflexibility. This total absence of movement in the tertiary larva,\r\nwhen a few days old, and also in the nymph, together with the\r\nsmallness of the space left free in the shell, would necessarily lead\r\nto the conviction, if we had not witnessed the first moments of the\r\ntertiary larva, that it is absolutely impossible for the creature to\r\nturn right round.\r\n\r\nAnd now see to what curious inferences this lack of observations made\r\nat the due moment may lead us. We collect some pseudochrysalids and\r\nheap them in a glass jar in all possible positions. The favourable\r\nseason arrives; and with very legitimate astonishment we find that, in\r\na large number of shells, the larva or nymph occupies an inverted\r\nposition, that is to say, the head is turned towards the anal\r\nextremity of the shell. In vain we watch these reversed bodies for any\r\nindications of movement; in vain we place the shells in every\r\nimaginable position, to see if the creature will turn round; in vain,\r\nonce more, we ask ourselves where the free space is which this turning\r\nwould demand. The illusion is complete: I have been taken in by it\r\nmyself; and for two years I indulged in the wildest conjectures to\r\naccount for this lack of correspondence between the shell and its\r\ncontents, to explain, in short, a fact which is inexplicable once the\r\npropitious moment has passed.\r\n\r\nOn the natural site, in the cells of the Anthophora, this apparent\r\nanomaly never occurs, because the secondary larva, when on the point\r\nof transformation into the pseudochrysalis, is always careful to place\r\nits head uppermost, according as the axis of the cell more or less\r\nnearly approaches the vertical. But, when the pseudochrysalids are\r\nplaced higgledy-piggledy in a box or jar, all those which are upside\r\ndown will later contain inverted larvae or nymphs.\r\n\r\nAfter four changes of form so profound as those which I have\r\ndescribed, one might reasonably expect to find some modifications of\r\nthe internal organization. Nevertheless, nothing is changed; the\r\nnervous system is the same in the tertiary larva as in the earlier\r\nphases; the reproductive organs do not yet show; and there is no need\r\nto mention the digestive apparatus, which remains invariable even in\r\nthe perfect insect.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the tertiary larva is a bare four or five weeks, which\r\nis also about the duration of the second. In July, when the secondary\r\nlarva passes into the pseudochrysalid stage, the tertiary larva passes\r\ninto the nymphal stage, still inside the double vesicular envelope.\r\nIts skin splits along the back in front; and with the assistance of a\r\nfew feeble contractions, which reappear at this juncture, it is thrust\r\nbehind in the shape of a little ball. There is therefore nothing here\r\nthat differs from what happens in the other Beetles.\r\n\r\nNor does the nymph which succeeds this tertiary larva present any\r\npeculiarity: it is the perfect insect in swaddling-bands, yellowish\r\nwhite, with its various external members, clear as crystal, displayed\r\nunder the abdomen. A few weeks elapse, during which the nymph partly\r\ndons the livery of the adult state; and, in about a month, the insect\r\nmoults for a last time, in the usual manner, in order to attain its\r\nfinal form. The wing-cases are now of a uniform yellowish white, as\r\nare the wings, the abdomen and the greater part of the legs; very\r\nnearly all the rest of the body is of a glossy black. In the space of\r\ntwenty-four hours, the wing-cases assume their half-black, half-russet\r\ncolouring; the wings grow darker; and the legs finish turning black.\r\nThis done, the adult organism is completed. However, the Sitaris\r\nremains still a fortnight in the intact shell, ejecting at intervals\r\nwhite droppings of uric acid, which it pushes back together with the\r\nshreds of its last two sloughs, those of the tertiary larva and of the\r\nnymph. Lastly, about the middle of August, it tears the double bag\r\nthat contains it, pierces the lid of the Anthophora's cell, enters a\r\ncorridor and appears outside in quest of the other sex.\r\n\r\nI have told how, while digging in search of the Sitaris, I found two\r\ncells belonging to _Meloe cicatricosus_. One contained an Anthophora's\r\negg; with this egg was a yellow Louse, the primary larva of the Meloe.\r\nThe history of this tiny creature we know. The second cell also was\r\nfull of honey. On the sticky liquid floated a little white larva,\r\nabout a sixth of an inch in length and very different from the other\r\nlittle white larvae belonging to Sitares. The rapid fluctuations of\r\nthe abdomen showed that it was eagerly drinking the strong-scented\r\nnectar collected by the Bee. This larva was the young Meloe in the\r\nsecond period of its development.\r\n\r\nI was not able to preserve these two precious cells, which I had\r\nopened wide to examine the contents. On my return from Carpentras, I\r\nfound that their honey had been spilt by the motion of the carriage\r\nand that their inhabitants were dead. On the 25th of June, a fresh\r\nvisit to the nests of the Anthophorae furnished me with two larvae\r\nlike the foregoing, but much larger. One of them was on the point of\r\nfinishing its store of honey, the other still had nearly half left.\r\nThe first was put in a place of safety with a thousand precautions,\r\nthe second was at once immersed in alcohol.\r\n\r\nThese larvae are blind, soft, fleshy, yellowish white, covered with a\r\nfine down visible only under the lens, curved into a fish-hook like\r\nthe larvae of the Lamellicorns, to which they bear a certain\r\nresemblance in their general configuration. The segments, including\r\nthe head, number thirteen, of which nine are provided with\r\nbreathing-holes with a pale, oval rim. These are the mesothorax and\r\nthe first eight abdominal segments. As in the Sitaris-larvae, the last\r\npair of stigmata, that of the eighth segment of the abdomen, is less\r\ndeveloped than the rest.\r\n\r\nThe head is horny, of a light brown colour. The epistoma is edged with\r\nbrown. The labrum is prominent, white and trapezoidal. The mandibles\r\nare black, strong, short, obtuse, only slightly curved, sharp-edged\r\nand furnished each with a broad tooth on the inner side. The maxillary\r\nand labial palpi are brown and shaped like very small studs with two\r\nor three joints to them. The antennae, inserted just at the base of\r\nthe mandibles, are brown, and consist of three sections: the first is\r\nthick and globular; the two others are much smaller in diameter and\r\ncylindrical. The legs are short, but fairly strong, able to serve the\r\ncreature for crawling or digging; they end in a strong black claw. The\r\nlength of the larva when fully developed is one inch.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can judge from the dissection of the specimen preserved in\r\nalcohol, whose viscera were affected by being kept too long in that\r\nliquid, the nervous system consists of eleven ganglia, not counting\r\nthe oesophageal collar; and the digestive apparatus does not differ\r\nperceptibly from that of an adult Oil-beetle.\r\n\r\nThe larger of the two larvae of the 25th of June, placed in a\r\ntest-tube with what remained of its provisions, assumed a new form\r\nduring the first week of the following month. Its skin split along the\r\nfront dorsal half and, after being pushed half back, left partly\r\nuncovered a pseudochrysalis bearing the closest analogy with that of\r\nthe Sitares. Newport did not see the larva of the Oil-beetle in its\r\nsecond form, that which it displays when it is eating the mess of\r\nhoney hoarded by the Bees, but he did see its moulted skin\r\nhalf-covering the pseudochrysalis which I have just mentioned. From\r\nthe sturdy mandibles and the legs armed with a powerful claw which he\r\nobserved on this moulted skin, Newport assumed that, instead of\r\nremaining in the same Anthophora-cell, the larva, which is capable of\r\nburrowing, passes from one cell to another in search of additional\r\nnourishment. This suspicion seems to me to be well-founded, for the\r\nsize which the larva finally attains exceeds the proportions which the\r\nsmall quantity of honey enclosed in a single cell would lead us to\r\nexpect.\r\n\r\nLet us go back to the pseudochrysalis. It is, as in the Sitares, an\r\ninert body, of a horny consistency, amber-coloured and divided into\r\nthirteen segments, including the head. Its length is 20\r\nmillimetres.[1] It is slightly curved into an arc, highly convex on\r\nthe dorsal surface, almost flat on the ventral surface and edged with\r\na projecting fillet which marks the division between the two. The head\r\nis only a sort of mask on which certain features are vaguely carved in\r\nstill relief, corresponding with the future parts of the head. On the\r\nthoracic segments are three pairs of tubercles, corresponding with the\r\nlegs of the recent larva and the future insect. Lastly, there are nine\r\npairs of stigmata, one pair on the mesothorax and the eight following\r\npairs on the first eight segments of the abdomen. The last pair is\r\nrather smaller than the rest, a peculiarity which we have already\r\nnoted in the larva which precedes the pseudochrysalis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: .787 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nOn comparing the pseudochrysalids of the Oil-beetles and Sitares, we\r\nobserve a most striking similarity between the two. The same structure\r\noccurs in both, down to the smallest details. We find on either side\r\nthe same cephalic masks, the same tubercles occupying the place of the\r\nlegs, the same distribution and the same number of stigmata and,\r\nlastly, the same colour, the same rigidity of the integuments. The\r\nonly points of difference are in the general appearance, which is not\r\nthe same in the two pseudochrysalids, and in the covering formed by\r\nthe cast skin of the late larva. In the Sitares, in fact, this cast\r\nskin constitutes a closed bag, a pouch completely enveloping the\r\npseudochrysalis; in the Oil-beetles, on the contrary, it is split down\r\nthe back and pushed to the rear and, consequently, only half-covers\r\nthe pseudochrysalis.\r\n\r\nThe post-mortem examination of the only pseudochrysalis in my\r\npossession showed me that, similarly to that which happens in the\r\nSitares, no change occurred in the organization of the viscera,\r\nnotwithstanding the profound transformations which take place\r\nexternally. In the midst of innumerable little sacs of adipose tissue\r\nis buried a thin thread in which we easily recognize the essential\r\nfeatures of the digestive apparatus, both of the preceding larval form\r\nand of the perfect insect. As for the medullary cord of the abdomen,\r\nit consists, as in the larva, of eight ganglia. In the perfect insect\r\nit comprises only four.\r\n\r\nI could not say positively how long the Oil-beetle remains in the\r\npseudochrysalid form; but, if we consider the very complete analogy\r\nbetween the evolution of the Oil-beetles and that of the Sitares,\r\nthere is reason to believe that a few pseudochrysalids complete their\r\ntransformation in the same year, while others, in greater numbers,\r\nremain stationary for a whole year and do not attain the state of the\r\nperfect insect until the following spring. This is also the opinion\r\nexpressed by Newport.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, I found at the end of August one of these\r\npseudochrysalids which had already attained the nymphal stage. It is\r\nwith the help of this precious capture that I shall be able to finish\r\nthe story of the Oil-beetle's development. The horny integuments of\r\nthe pseudochrysalis are split along a fissure which includes the whole\r\nventral surface and the whole of the head and runs up the back of the\r\nthorax. This cast skin, which is stiff and keeps its shape, is\r\nhalf-enclosed, as was the pseudochrysalis, in the skin shed by the\r\nsecondary larva. Lastly, through the fissure, which divides it almost\r\nin two, a Meloe-nymph half-emerges; so that, to all appearances, the\r\npseudochrysalis has been followed immediately by the nymph, which does\r\nnot happen with the Sitares, which pass from the first of these two\r\nstates to the second only by assuming an intermediary form closely\r\nresembling that of the larva which eats the store of honey.\r\n\r\nBut these appearances are deceptive, for, on removing the nymph from\r\nthe split sheath formed by the integuments of the pseudochrysalis, we\r\nfind, at the bottom of this sheath, a third cast skin, the last of\r\nthose which the creature has so far rejected. This skin is even now\r\nadhering to the nymph by a few tracheal filaments. If we soften it in\r\nwater, we easily recognize that it possesses an organization almost\r\nidentical with that which preceded the pseudochrysalis. In the latter\r\ncase only, the mandibles and the legs are not so robust. Thus, after\r\npassing through the pseudochrysalid stage, the Oil-beetles for some\r\ntime resume the preceding form, almost without modification.\r\n\r\nThe nymph comes next. It presents no peculiarities. The only nymph\r\nthat I have reared attained the perfect insect state at the end of\r\nSeptember. Under ordinary conditions would the adult Oil-beetle have\r\nemerged from her cell at this period? I do not think so, since the\r\npairing and egg-laying do not take place until the beginning of\r\nspring. She would no doubt have spent the autumn and the winter in the\r\nAnthophora's dwelling, only leaving it in the spring following. It is\r\neven probable that, as a rule, the development is even slower and that\r\nthe Oil-beetles, like the Sitares, for the most part spend the cold\r\nseason in the pseudochrysalid state, a state well-adapted to the\r\nwinter torpor, and do not achieve their numerous forms until the\r\nreturn of the warm weather.\r\n\r\nThe Sitares and Meloes belong to the same family, that of the\r\nMeloidae.[2] Their strange transformations must probably extend\r\nthroughout the group; indeed, I had the good fortune to discover a\r\nthird example, which I have not hitherto been able to study in all its\r\ndetails after twenty-five years of investigation. On six occasions, no\r\noftener, during this long period I have set eyes on the\r\npseudochrysalis which I am about to describe. Thrice I obtained it\r\nfrom old Chalicodoma-nests built upon a stone, nests which I at first\r\nattributed to the Chalicodoma of the Walls and which I now refer with\r\ngreater probability to the Chalicodoma of the Sheds. I once extracted\r\nit from the galleries bored by some wood-eating larva in the trunk of\r\na dead wild pear-tree, galleries afterwards utilized for the cells of\r\nan Osmia, I do not know which. Lastly, I found a pair of them in\r\nbetween the row of cocoons of the Three-pronged Osmia (_O.\r\ntridentata_, DUF.), who provides a home for her larvae in a channel\r\ndug in the dry bramble stems. The insect in question therefore is a\r\nparasite of the Osmiae. When I extract it from the old\r\nChalicodoma-nests, I have to attribute it not to this Bee but to one\r\nof the Osmiae (_O. tricornis_ and _O. Latreillii_) who, when making\r\ntheir nests, utilize the old galleries of the Mason-bee.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Later classifiers place both in the family of the\r\nCantharidae.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThe most nearly complete instances that I have seen furnishes me with\r\nthe following data: the pseudochrysalis is very closely enveloped in\r\nthe skin of the secondary larva, a skin consisting of fine transparent\r\npellicle, without any rent whatever. This is the pouch of the Sitaris,\r\nsave that it lies in immediate contact with the body enclosed. On this\r\njacket we distinguish three pairs of tiny legs, reduced to short\r\nvestiges, to stumps. The head is in place, showing quite perceptibly\r\nthe fine mandibles and the other parts of the mouth. There is no trace\r\nof eyes. Each side has a white edging of shrivelled tracheae, running\r\nfrom one stigmatic orifice to another.\r\n\r\nNext comes the pseudochrysalis, horny, currant-red, cylindrical,\r\ncone-shaped at both ends, slightly convex on the dorsal surface and\r\nconcave on the ventral surface. It is covered with delicate, prominent\r\nspots, sprinkled very close together; it takes a lens to show them. It\r\nis 1 centimetre long and 4 millimetres wide.[3] We can distinguish a\r\nlarge knob of a head, on which the mouth is vaguely outlined; three\r\npairs of little shiny brown specks, which are the hardly perceptible\r\nvestiges of the legs; and on each side a row of eight black specks,\r\nwhich are the stigmatic orifices. The first speck stands by itself, in\r\nfront; the seven others, divided from the first by an empty space,\r\nform a continuous row. Lastly, at the opposite end is a little pit,\r\nthe sign of the anal pore.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: .393 x .156 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nOf the six pseudochrysalids which a lucky accident placed at my\r\ndisposal, four were dead; the other two were furnished by _Zonitis\r\nmutica_. This justified my forecast, which from the first, with\r\nanalogy for my guide, made me attribute these curious organizations to\r\nthe genus Zonitis. The meloidal parasite of the Osmiae, therefore, is\r\nrecognized. We have still to make the acquaintance of the primary\r\nlarva, which gets itself carried by the Osmia into the cell full of\r\nhoney, and the tertiary larva, the one which, at a given moment, must\r\nbe found contained in the pseudochrysalis, a larva which will be\r\nsucceeded by the nymph.\r\n\r\nLet us recapitulate the strange metamorphoses which I have sketched.\r\nEvery Beetle-larva, before attaining the nymphal stage, undergoes a\r\ngreater or smaller number of moults, of changes of skin; but these\r\nmoults, which are intended to favour the development of the larva by\r\nridding it of covering that has become too tight for it, in no way\r\nalter its external shape. After any moult that it may have undergone,\r\nthe larva retains the same characteristics. If it begin by being\r\ntough, it will not become tender; if it be equipped with legs, it will\r\nnot be deprived of them later; if it be provided with ocelli, it will\r\nnot become blind. It is true that the diet of these non-variable\r\nlarvae remains the same throughout their duration, as do the\r\nconditions under which they are destined to live.\r\n\r\nBut suppose that this diet varies, that the environment in which they\r\nare called upon to live changes, that the circumstances accompanying\r\ntheir development are liable to great changes: it then becomes evident\r\nthat the moult may and even must adapt the organization of the larva\r\nto these new conditions of existence. The primary larva of the Sitaris\r\nlives on the body of the Anthophora. Its perilous peregrinations\r\ndemand agility of movement, long-sighted eyes and masterly\r\nbalancing-appliances; it has, in fact, a slender shape, ocelli, legs\r\nand special organs adapted to averting a fall. Once inside the Bee's\r\ncell, it has to destroy the egg; its sharp mandibles, curved into\r\nhooks, will fulfil this office. This done, there is a change of diet:\r\nafter the Anthophora's egg the larva proceeds to consume the ration of\r\nhoney. The environment in which it has to live also changes: instead\r\nof balancing itself on a hair of the Anthophora, it has now to float\r\non a sticky fluid; instead of living in broad daylight, it has to\r\nremain plunged in the profoundest darkness. Its sharp mandibles must\r\ntherefore become hollowed into a spoon that they may scoop up the\r\nhoney; its legs, its cirri, its balancing-appliances must disappear as\r\nuseless and even harmful, since all these organs can only involve the\r\nlarva in serious danger, by causing it to stick in the honey; its\r\nslender shape, its horny integuments, its ocelli, being no longer\r\nnecessary in a dark cell where movement is impossible, where there are\r\nno rough encounters to be feared, may likewise give place to complete\r\nblindness, to soft integuments, to a heavy, slothful form. This\r\ntransfiguration, which everything shows to be indispensable to the\r\nlife of the larva, is effected by a simple moult.\r\n\r\nWe do not so plainly perceive the necessity of the subsequent forms,\r\nwhich are so abnormal that nothing like them is known in all the rest\r\nof the insect class. The larva which is fed on honey first adopts a\r\nfalse chrysalid appearance and afterwards goes back to its earlier\r\nform, though the necessity for these transformations escapes us\r\nentirely. Here I am obliged to record the facts and to leave the task\r\nof interpreting them to the future. The larva of the Meloidae,\r\ntherefore, undergo four moults before attaining the nymphal state; and\r\nafter each moult their characteristics alter most profoundly. During\r\nall these external changes, the internal organization remains\r\nunchangingly the same; and it is only at the moment of the nymph's\r\nappearance that the nervous system becomes concentrated and that the\r\nreproductive organs are developed, absolutely as in the other Beetles.\r\n\r\nThus, to the ordinary metamorphoses which make a Beetle pass\r\nsuccessively through the stages of larva, nymph and perfect insect,\r\nthe Meloidae add others which repeatedly transform the larva's\r\nexterior, without introducing any modification of its viscera. This\r\nmode of development, which preludes the customary entomological forms\r\nby the multiple transfigurations of the larva, certainly deserves a\r\nspecial name: I suggest that of _hypermetamorphosis_.\r\n\r\nLet us now recapitulate the more prominent facts of this essay.\r\n\r\nThe Sitares, the Meloes, the Zonites and apparently other Meloidae,\r\npossibly all of them, are in their earliest infancy parasites of the\r\nharvesting Bees.\r\n\r\nThe larva of the Meloidae, before reaching the nymphal state, passes\r\nthrough four forms, which I call the _primary larva_, the _secondary\r\nlarva_, the _pseudochrysalis_ and the _tertiary larva_. The passage\r\nfrom one of these forms to the next is effected by a simple moult,\r\nwithout any changes in the viscera.\r\n\r\nThe primary larva is leathery and settles on the Bee's body. Its\r\nobject is to get itself carried into a cell filled with honey. On\r\nreaching the cell, it devours the Bee's egg; and its part is played.\r\n\r\nThe secondary larva is soft and differs completely from the primary\r\nlarva in its external characteristics. It feeds upon the honey\r\ncontained in the usurped cell.\r\n\r\nThe pseudochrysalis is a body deprived of all movement and clad in\r\nhorny integuments which may be compared with those of the pupae and\r\nchrysalids. On these integuments we see a cephalic mask without\r\ndistinct or movable parts, six tubercles indicating the legs and nine\r\npairs of breathing-holes. In the Sitares the pseudochrysalis is\r\nenclosed in a sort of sealed pouch and in the Zonites in a\r\ntight-fitting bag formed of the skin of the secondary larva. In the\r\nMeloes it is simply half-sheathed in the split skin of the secondary\r\nlarva.\r\n\r\nThe tertiary larva reproduces almost exactly the peculiarities of the\r\nsecond; it is enclosed, in the Sitares and probably also the Zonites,\r\nin a double vesicular envelope formed of the skin of the secondary\r\nlarva and the slough of the pseudochrysalis. In the Meloes, it is\r\nhalf-enclosed in the split integuments of the pseudochrysalis, even as\r\nthese, in their turn, are half-enclosed in the skin of the secondary\r\nlarva.\r\n\r\nFrom the tertiary larva onwards the metamorphoses follow their\r\nhabitual course, that is to say, this larva becomes a nymph; and this\r\nnymph the perfect insect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nCEROCOMAE, MYLABRES AND ZONITES\r\n\r\n\r\nAll has not been told concerning the Meloidae, those strange\r\nparasites, some of which, the Sitares and the Oil-beetles, attach\r\nthemselves, like the tiniest of Lice, to the fleece of various Bees to\r\nget themselves carried into the cell where they will destroy the egg\r\nand afterwards feed upon the ration of honey. A most unexpected\r\ndiscovery, made a few hundred yards from my door, has warned me once\r\nagain how dangerous it is to generalize. To take it for granted, as\r\nthe mass of data hitherto collected seemed to justify us in doing,\r\nthat all the Meloidae of our country usurp the stores of honey\r\naccumulated by the Bees, was surely a most judicious and natural\r\ngeneralization. Many have accepted it without hesitation; and I for my\r\npart was one of them. For on what are we to base our conviction when\r\nwe imagine that we are stating a law? We think to take our stand upon\r\nthe general; and we plunge into the quicksands of error. And behold,\r\nthe law of the Meloidae has to be struck off the statutes, a fate\r\ncommon to many others, as this chapter will prove.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of July, 1883, I was digging, with my son Emile, in the\r\nsandy heap where, a few days earlier, I had been observing the labours\r\nand the surgery of the Mantis-killing Tachytes. My purpose was to\r\ncollect a few cocoons of this Digger-wasp. The cocoons were turning up\r\nin abundance under my pocket-trowel, when Emile presented me with an\r\nunknown object. Absorbed in my task of collection, I slipped the find\r\ninto my box without examining it further than with a rapid glance. We\r\nleft the spot. Half-way home, the ardour of my search became assuaged;\r\nand a thought of the problematical object, so negligently dropped into\r\nthe box among the cocoons, flashed across my mind.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo!\" I said to myself. \"Suppose it were _that_? Why not? But, no,\r\nyes, it _is_ that; that's just what it is!\"\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly turning to Emile, who was rather surprised by this\r\nsoliloquy:\r\n\r\n\"My boy,\" I said, \"you have had a magnificent find. It's a\r\npseudochrysalis of the Meloidae. It's a document of incalculable\r\nvalue; you've struck a fresh vein in the extraordinary records of\r\nthese creatures. Let us look at it closely and at once.\"\r\n\r\nThe thing was taken from the box, dusted by blowing on it and\r\ncarefully examined. I really had before my eyes the pseudochrysalis of\r\nsome Meloid. Its shape was unfamiliar to me. No matter: I was an old\r\nhand and could not mistake its source. Everything assured me that I\r\nwas on the track of an insect that rivalled the Sitares and the\r\nOil-beetles in the strangeness of its transformations; and, what was a\r\nstill more precious fact, its occurrence amid the burrows of the\r\nMantis-killer told me that its habits would be wholly different.\r\n\r\n\"It's very hot, my poor Emile; we are both of us pretty done. Never\r\nmind: let's go back to our sand-hill and dig and have another search.\r\nI must have the larva that comes before the pseudochrysalis; I must,\r\nif possible, have the insect that comes out of it.\"\r\n\r\nSuccess responded amply to our zeal. We found a goodly number of\r\npseudochrysalids. More often still, we unearthed larvae which were\r\nbusy eating the Mantes, the rations of the Tachytes. Are these really\r\nthe larvae that turn into the pseudochrysalids? It seems very\r\nprobable, but there is room for doubt. Rearing them at home will\r\ndispel the mists of probability and replace them by the light of\r\ncertainty. But that is all: I have not a vestige of the perfect insect\r\nto inform me of the nature of the parasite. The future, let us hope,\r\nwill fill this gap. Such was the result of the first trench opened in\r\nthe heap of sand. Later searches enriched my harvest a little, without\r\nfurnishing me with fresh data.\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed to examine my double find. And first of all the\r\npseudochrysalis, which put me on the alert. It is a motionless, rigid\r\nbody, of a waxen yellow, smooth, shiny, curved like a fish-hook\r\ntowards the head, which is inflected. Under a very powerful\r\nmagnifying-glass the surface is seen to be strewn with very tiny\r\npoints which are slightly raised and shinier than the surface. There\r\nare thirteen segments, including the head. The dorsal surface is\r\nconvex, the ventral surface flat. A blunt ridge divides the two\r\nsurfaces. The three thoracic segments bear each a pair of tiny conical\r\nnipples, of a deep rusty red, signs of the future legs. The stigmata\r\nare very distinct, appearing as specks of a deeper red than the rest\r\nof the integuments. There is one pair, the largest, on the second\r\nsegment of the thorax, almost on the line dividing it from the first\r\nsegment. Then follow eight pairs, one on each segment of the abdomen\r\nexcept the last, making in all nine pairs of stigmata. The last pair,\r\nthat of the eighth abdominal segment, is the smallest.\r\n\r\nThe anal extremity displays no peculiarity. The cephalic mask\r\ncomprises eight cone-shaped tubercles, dark red like the tubercles of\r\nthe legs. Six of these are arranged in two lateral rows; the others\r\nare between the two rows. In each row of three nipples, the one in the\r\nmiddle is the largest; it no doubt corresponds with the mandibles. The\r\nlength of this organism varies greatly, fluctuating between 8 and 15\r\nmillimetres.[1] Its width is from 3 to 4 millimetres.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: .312 to .585 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: .117 to .156 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nApart from the general configuration, it will be seen that we have\r\nhere the strikingly characteristic appearance of the pseudochrysalids\r\nof the Sitares, Oil-beetles and Zonites. There are the same rigid\r\ninteguments, of the red of a cough-lozenge or virgin wax; the same\r\ncephalic mask, in which the future mouth-parts are represented by\r\nfaintly marked tubercles; the same thoracic studs, which are the\r\nvestiges of the legs; the same distribution of the stigmata. I was\r\ntherefore firmly convinced that the parasite of the Mantis-hunters\r\ncould only be a Meloid.\r\n\r\nLet us also record the description of the strange larva found\r\ndevouring the heap of Mantes in the burrows of the Tachytes. It is\r\nnaked, blind, white, soft and sharply curved. Its general appearance\r\nsuggests the larva of some Weevil. I should be even more accurate if I\r\ncompared it with the secondary larva of _Meloe cicatricosus_, of which\r\nI once published a drawing in the _Annales des sciences\r\nnaturelles_.[3] If we reduce the dimensions considerably, we shall\r\nhave something very like the parasite of the Tachytes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: It was his essays in this periodical, on the\r\nmetamorphoses of the Sitares and Oil-beetles, that procured Fabre his\r\nfirst reputation as an entomologist.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThe head is large, faintly tinged with red. The mandibles are strong,\r\nbent into a pointed hook, black at the tip and a fiery red at the\r\nbase. The antennae are very short, inserted close to the root of the\r\nmandibles. I count three joints: the first thick and globular, the\r\nother two cylindrical, the second of these cut short abruptly. There\r\nare twelve segments, apart from the head, divided by fairly definite\r\ngrooves. The first thoracic segment is a little longer than the rest,\r\nwith the dorsal plate very slightly tinged with russet, as is the top\r\nof the head. Beginning with the tenth segment, the body tapers a\r\nlittle. A slight scalloped rim divides the dorsal from the ventral\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe legs are short, white and transparent and end in a feeble claw. A\r\npair of stigmata on the mesothorax, near the line of junction with the\r\nprothorax; a stigma on either side of the first eight abdominal\r\nsegments; in all nine pairs of stigmata, distributed like those of the\r\npseudochrysalis. These stigmata are small, tinged with red and rather\r\ndifficult to distinguish. Varying in size, like the pseudochrysalid\r\nwhich seems to come from it, this larva averages nearly half an inch\r\nin length and an eighth of an inch in width.\r\n\r\nThe six little legs, feeble though they be, perform services which one\r\nwould not at first suspect. They embrace the Mantis that is being\r\ndevoured and hold her under the mandibles, while the grub, lying on\r\nits side, takes its meal at its ease. They also serve for locomotion.\r\nOn a firm surface, such as the wooden top of my table, the larva can\r\nmove about quite well; it toddles along, dragging its belly, with its\r\nbody straight from end to end. On fine, loose sand, change of position\r\nbecomes difficult. The grub now bends itself into a bow; it wriggles\r\nupon its back, upon its side; it crawls a little way; it digs and\r\nheaves with its mandibles. But let a less crumbling support come to\r\nits assistance; and pilgrimages of some length are not beyond its\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nI reared my guests in a box divided into compartments by means of\r\npaper partitions. Each space, representing about the capacity of a\r\nTachytes-cell, received its layer of sand, its pile of Mantes and its\r\nlarva. And more than one disturbance arose in this refectory, where I\r\nhad reckoned upon keeping the banqueters isolated one from the other,\r\neach at its special table. This larva, which had finished its ration\r\nthe day before, was discovered next day in another chamber, where it\r\nwas sharing its neighbour's repast. It had therefore climbed the\r\npartition, which for that matter was of no great height, or else had\r\nforced its way through some chink. This is enough, I think, to prove\r\nthat the grub is not a strict stay-at-home, as are the larvae of the\r\nSitares and the Oil-beetles when devouring the ration of the\r\nAnthophora.\r\n\r\nI imagine that, in the burrows of the Tachytes, the grub, when its\r\nheap of Mantes is consumed, moves from cell to cell until it has\r\nsatisfied its appetite. Its subterranean excursions cannot cover a\r\nwide range, but they enable it to visit a few adjacent cells. I have\r\nmentioned how greatly the Tachytes' provision of Mantes varies.[4] The\r\nsmaller rations certainly fall to the males, which are puny dwarfs\r\ncompared with their companions; the more plentiful fall to the\r\nfemales. The parasitic grub to which fate has allotted the scanty\r\nmasculine ration has not perhaps sufficient with this share; it wants\r\nan extra portion, which it can obtain by changing its cell. If it be\r\nfavoured by chance, it will eat according to the measure of its hunger\r\nand will attain the full development of which its race allows; if it\r\nwander about without finding anything, it will fast and will remain\r\nsmall. This would explain the differences which I note in both the\r\ngrubs and the pseudochrysalids, differences amounting in linear\r\ndimensions to a hundred per cent and more. The rations, rare or\r\nabundant according to the cells lit upon, would determine the size of\r\nthe parasite.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The essay on the Tachytes has not yet appeared in\r\nEnglish. It will form part of a volume entitled _More Hunting\r\nWasps_.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nDuring the active period, the larva undergoes a few moults; I have\r\nwitnessed at least one of these. The creature stripped of its skin\r\nappears as it was before, without any change of form. It instantly\r\nresumes its meal, which was interrupted while the old skin was shed;\r\nit embraces with its legs another Mantis on the heap and proceeds to\r\nnibble her. Whether simple or multiple, this moult has nothing in\r\ncommon with the renewals due to the hypermetamorphosis, which so\r\nprofoundly change the creature's appearance.\r\n\r\nTen days' rearing in the partitioned box is enough to prove how right\r\nI was when I looked upon the parasitic larva feeding on Mantes as the\r\norigin of the pseudochrysalis, the object of my eager attention. The\r\ncreature, which I kept supplied with additional food as long as it\r\naccepted it, stops eating at last. It becomes motionless, retracts its\r\nhead slightly and bends itself into a hook. Then the skin splits\r\nacross the head and down the thorax. The tattered slough is thrust\r\nback; and the pseudochrysalis appears in sight, absolutely naked. It\r\nis white at first, as the larva was; but by degrees and fairly rapidly\r\nit turns to the russet hue of virgin wax, with a brighter red at the\r\ntips of the various tubercles which indicate the future legs and\r\nmouth-parts. This shedding of the skin, which leaves the body of the\r\npseudochrysalis uncovered, recalls the mode of transformation observed\r\nin the Oil-beetles and is different from that of the Sitares and the\r\nZonites, whose pseudochrysalis remains wholly enveloped in the skin of\r\nthe secondary larva, a sort of bag which is sometimes loose, sometimes\r\ntight and always unbroken.\r\n\r\nThe mist that surrounded us at the outset is dispelled. This is indeed\r\na Meloid, a true Meloid, one of the strangest anomalies among the\r\nparasites of its tribe. Instead of living on the honey of a Bee, it\r\nfeeds on the skewerful of Mantes provided by a Tachytes. The\r\nNorth-American naturalists have taught us lately that honey is not\r\nalways the diet of the Blister-beetles: some Meloidae in the United\r\nStates devour the packets of eggs laid by the Grasshoppers. This is a\r\nlegitimate acquisition on their part, not an illegal seizure of the\r\nfood-stores of others. No one, as far as I am aware, had as yet\r\nsuspected the true parasitism of a carnivorous Meloid. It is\r\nnevertheless very remarkable to find in the Blister-beetles, on both\r\nsides of the Atlantic, this weakness for the flavour of Locust: one\r\ndevours her eggs; the other a representative of the order, in the\r\nshape of the Praying Mantis and her kin.\r\n\r\nWho will explain to me this predilection for the Orthopteron in a\r\ntribe whose chief, the Oil-beetle, accepts nothing but the mess of\r\nhoney? Why do insects which appear close together in all our\r\nclassifications possess such opposite tastes? If they spring from a\r\ncommon stock, how did the consumption of flesh supplant the\r\nconsumption of honey? How did the Lamb become a Wolf? This is the\r\ngreat problem which was once set us, in an inverse form, by the\r\nSpotted Sapyga, a honey-eating relative of the flesh-eating Scolia.[5]\r\nI submit the question to whom it may concern.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The essays on these will appear in the volume, entitled\r\n_The Hunting Wasps_, aforementioned.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThe following year, at the beginning of June, some of my\r\npseudochrysalids split open transversely behind the head and\r\nlengthwise down the whole of the median line of the back, except the\r\nlast two or three segments. From it emerges the tertiary larva, which,\r\nfrom a simple examination with the pocket-lens, appears to me, in its\r\ngeneral features, identical with the secondary larva, the one which\r\neats the Tachytes' provisions. It is naked and pale-yellow, the colour\r\nof butter. It is active and wriggles with awkward movements.\r\nOrdinarily it lies upon its side, but it can also stand in the normal\r\nposition. The creature is then trying to use its legs, without finding\r\nsufficient purchase to enable it to walk. A few days later, it\r\nrelapses into complete repose.\r\n\r\nThirteen segments, including the head, which is large, with a\r\nquadrilateral cranium, rounded at the sides. Short antennae,\r\nconsisting of three knotted joints. Powerful curved mandibles, with\r\ntwo or three little teeth at the end, of a fairly bright red. Labial\r\npalpi rather bulky, short and with three joints, like the antennae.\r\nThe mouth-parts, labrum, mandibles and palpi are movable and stir\r\nslightly, as though seeking food. A small brown speck near the base of\r\neach antenna, marking the place of the future eyes. Prothorax wider\r\nthan the segments that come after it. These are all of one width and\r\nare distinctly divided by a furrow and a slight lateral rim. Legs\r\nshort, transparent, without a terminal claw. They are three-jointed\r\nstumps. Pale stigmata, eight pairs of them, placed as in the\r\npseudochrysalis, that is, the first and largest pair on the line\r\ndividing the first two segments of the thorax and the seven others on\r\nthe first seven abdominal segments. The secondary larva and the\r\npseudochrysalis also have a very small stigma on the penultimate\r\nsegment of the abdomen. This stigma has disappeared in the tertiary\r\nlarva; at least I cannot detect it with the aid of a good\r\nmagnifying-glass.\r\n\r\nLastly, we find the same strong mandibles as in the secondary larva,\r\nthe same feeble legs, the same appearance of a Weevil-grub. The\r\nmovements return, but are less clearly marked than in the primary\r\nform. The passage through the pseudochrysalid state has led to no\r\nchange that is really worth describing. The creature, after this\r\nsingular phase, is what it was before. The Meloes and Sitares, for\r\nthat matter, behave similarly.\r\n\r\nThen what can be the meaning of this pseudochrysalid stage, which,\r\nwhen passed, leads precisely to the point of departure? The Meloid\r\nseems to be revolving in a circle: it undoes what it has just done, it\r\ndraws back after advancing. The idea sometimes occurs to me to look\r\nupon the pseudochrysalis as a sort of egg of a superior organization,\r\nstarting from which the insect follows the ordinary law of\r\nentomological phases and passes through the successive stages of\r\nlarva, nymph and perfect insect. The first hatching, that of the\r\nnormal egg, makes the Meloid go through the larval dimorphism of the\r\nAnthrax and the Leucospis. The primary larva finds its way to the\r\nvictuals; the secondary larva consumes them. The second hatching, that\r\nof the pseudochrysalis, reverts to the usual course, so that the\r\ninsect passes through the three customary forms: larva, nymph, adult.\r\n\r\nThe tertiary larval stage is of brief duration, lasting about a\r\nfortnight. The larva then sheds its skin by a longitudinal rent along\r\nthe back, as did the secondary larva, uncovering the nymph, in which\r\nwe recognize the Beetle, the genus and species being almost\r\ndeterminable by the antennae.\r\n\r\nThe second year's development turned out badly. The few nymphs which I\r\nobtained about the middle of June shrivelled up without attaining the\r\nperfect form. Some pseudochrysalids remained on my hands without\r\nshowing any sign of approaching transformation. I attributed this\r\ndelay to lack of warmth. I was in fact keeping them in the shade, on a\r\nwhat-not, in my study, whereas under natural conditions they are\r\nexposed to the hottest sun, beneath a layer of sand a few inches deep.\r\nTo imitate these conditions without burying my charges, whose progress\r\nI wished to follow comfortably, I placed the pseudochrysalids that\r\nremained on a layer of fresh sand at the bottom of a glass receiver.\r\nDirect exposure to the sun was impracticable: it would have been fatal\r\nat a period when life is subterranean. To avoid it, I tied over the\r\nmouth of the receiver a few thicknesses of black cloth, to represent\r\nthe natural screen of sand; and the apparatus thus prepared was\r\nexposed for some weeks to the most brilliant sunshine in my window.\r\nUnder the cloth cover, which, owing to its colour, favours the\r\nabsorption of heat, the temperature, during the day-time, became that\r\nof an oven; and yet the pseudochrysalids persisted in remaining\r\nstationary. The end of July was near and nothing indicated a speedy\r\nhatching. Convinced that my attempts at heating would be fruitless, I\r\nreplaced the pseudochrysalids in the shade, on the shelves, in glass\r\ntubes. Here they passed a second year, still in the same condition.\r\n\r\nJune returned once more and with it the appearance of the tertiary\r\nlarva, followed by the nymph. For the second time this stage of\r\ndevelopment was not exceeded; the one and only nymph that I succeeded\r\nin obtaining shrivelled, like those of the year before. Will these two\r\nfailures, arising no doubt from the overdry atmosphere of my\r\nreceivers, conceal from us the genus and the species of the\r\nMantis-eating Meloid? Fortunately, no. The riddle is easily solved by\r\ndeduction and comparison.\r\n\r\nThe only Melodiae in my part of the country which, though their habits\r\nare still unknown, might correspond in size with either the larva or\r\nthe pseudochrysalis in question are the Twelve-pointed Mylabris and\r\nSchaeffer's Cerocoma. I find the first in July on the flowers of the\r\nsea scabious; I find the second at the end of May and in June on the\r\nheads of the Iles d'Hyeres everlasting. This last date is best-suited\r\nto explain the presence of the parasitic larva and its pseudochrysalis\r\nin the Tachytes' burrows from July onwards. Moreover, the Cerocoma is\r\nvery abundant in the neighbourhood of the sand-heaps haunted by the\r\nTachytes, while the Mylabris does not occur there. Nor is this all:\r\nthe few nymphs obtained have curious antennae, ending in a full,\r\nirregular tuft, the like of which is found only in the antennae of the\r\nmale Cerocoma. The Mylabris, therefore, must be eliminated; the\r\nantennae, in the nymph, must be regularly jointed, as they are in the\r\nperfect insect. There remains the Cerocoma.\r\n\r\nAny lingering doubts may be dispelled: by good fortune, a friend of\r\nmine, Dr. Beauregard, who is preparing a masterly work upon the\r\nBlister-beetles, had some pseudochrysalids of Schreber's Cerocoma in\r\nhis possession. Having visited Serignan for the purpose of scientific\r\ninvestigations, he had searched the Tachytes' sand-heaps in my company\r\nand taken back to Paris a few pseudochrysalids of grubs fed on Mantes,\r\nin order to follow their development. His attempts, like mine, had\r\nmiscarried; but, on comparing the Serignan pseudochrysalids with those\r\nof Schreber's Cerocoma, which came from Aramon, near Avignon, he was\r\nable to establish the closest resemblance between the two organisms.\r\nEverything therefore confirms the supposition that my discovery can\r\nrelate only to Schaeffer's Cerocoma. As for the other, it must be\r\neliminated: its extreme rarity in my neighbourhood is a sufficient\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nIt is tiresome that the diet of the Aramon Meloid is not known. If I\r\nallowed myself to be guided by analogy, I should be inclined to regard\r\nSchreber's Cerocoma as a parasite of _Tachytes tarsina_, who buries\r\nher hoards of young Locusts in the high sandy banks. In that case, the\r\ntwo Cerocomae would have a similar diet. But I leave it to Dr.\r\nBeauregard to elucidate this important characteristic.\r\n\r\nThe riddle is deciphered: the Meloid that eats Praying Mantes is\r\nSchaeffer's Cerocoma, of whom I find plenty, in the spring, on the\r\nblossoms of the everlasting. Whenever I see it, my attention is\r\nattracted by an unusual peculiarity: the great difference of size that\r\nis able to exist between one specimen and another, albeit of the same\r\nsex. I see stunted creatures, females as well as males, which are\r\nbarely one third the length of their better-developed companions. The\r\nTwelve-spotted Mylabris and the Four-spotted Mylabris present\r\ndifferences quite as pronounced in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe cause which makes a dwarf or a giant of the same insect,\r\nirrespective of its sex, can be only the smaller or greater quantity\r\nof food. If the larva, as I suspect, is obliged to find the Tachytes'\r\ngame-larder for itself and to visit a second and a third, when the\r\nfirst is too frugally furnished, it may be imagined that the hazard of\r\nthe road does not favour all in the same way, but rather allots\r\nabundance to one and penury to another. The grub that does not eat its\r\nfill remains small, while the one that gluts itself grows fat. These\r\ndifferences of size, in themselves, betray parasitism. If a mother's\r\npains had amassed the food, or if the family had had the industry to\r\nobtain it direct instead of robbing others, the ration would be\r\npractically equal for all; and the inequalities in size would be\r\nreduced to those which often occur between the two sexes.\r\n\r\nThey speak, moreover, of a precarious, risky parasitism, wherein the\r\nMeloid is not sure of finding its food, which the Sitaris finds so\r\ndeftly, getting itself carried by the Anthophora, after being born at\r\nthe very entrance to the Bee's galleries and leaving its retreat only\r\nto slip into its host's fleece. A vagabond obliged to find for itself\r\nthe food that suits it, the Cerocoma incurs the risk of Lenten fare.\r\n\r\nOne chapter is lacking to complete the history of Schaeffer's\r\nCerocoma: that which treats of the beginning, the laying of the eggs,\r\nthe egg itself and the primary larva. While watching the development\r\nof the Mantis-eating parasite, I took my precautions, in the first\r\nyear, to discover its starting-point. By eliminating what was known to\r\nme and seeking among the Meloidae of my neighbourhood for the size\r\nthat corresponded with the pseudochrysalids unearthed from the\r\nTachytes' burrows, I found, as I have said, only Schaeffer's Cerocoma\r\nand the Twelve-spotted Mylabris. I undertook to rear these in order to\r\nobtain their eggs.\r\n\r\nAs a standard of comparison, the Four-spotted Mylabris, of a more\r\nimposing size, was added to the first two. A fourth, _Zonitis mutica_,\r\nwhom I did not need to consult, knowing that she was not connected\r\nwith the matter in hand and being familiar with her pseudochrysalis,\r\ncompleted my school of egg-layers. I proposed, if possible, to obtain\r\nher primary larva. Lastly, I had formerly reared some Cantharides with\r\nthe object of observing their egg-laying. In all, five species of\r\nBlister-beetles, reared in a breeding-cage, have left a few lines of\r\nnotes in my records.\r\n\r\nThe method of rearing is of the simplest. Each species is placed under\r\na large wire-gauze dome standing in a basin filled with earth. In the\r\nmiddle of the enclosure is a bottle full of water, in which the food\r\nsoaks and keeps fresh. For the Cantharides, this is a bundle of\r\nash-twigs; for the Four-spotted Mylabris, a bunch of bindweed\r\n(_Convolvus arvensis_) or psoralea (_P. biluminosa_), of which the\r\ninsect nibbles only the corollae. For the Twelve-spotted Mylabris, I\r\nprovide blossoms of the scabious (_Scabiosa maritima_); for the\r\nZonitis, the full-blown heads of the eryngo (_Eryngium campestre_);\r\nfor Schaeffer's Cerocoma, the heads of the Iles d'Hyeres everlasting\r\n(_Helichrysum stoechas_). These three last nibble more particularly\r\nthe anthers, more rarely the petals, never the leaves.\r\n\r\nA sorry intellect and sorry manners, which hardly repay the minute\r\ncares involved in the rearing. To browse, to love her lord, to dig a\r\nhole in the earth and carelessly to bury her eggs in it: that is the\r\nwhole life of the adult Meloid. The dull creature acquires a little\r\ninterest only at the moment when the male begins to toy with his mate.\r\nEvery species has its own ritual in declaring its passion; and it is\r\nnot beneath the dignity of the observer to witness the manifestations,\r\nsometimes so very strange, of the universal Eros, who rules the world\r\nand brings a tremor to even the lowest of the brute creation. This is\r\nthe ultimate aim of the insect, which becomes transfigured for this\r\nsolemn function and then dies, having no more to do.\r\n\r\nA curious book might be written on the subject of love among the\r\nbeasts. Long ago the subject tempted me. For a quarter of a century my\r\nnotes have been slumbering, dustily, in a corner of my library. I\r\nextract from them the following details concerning the Cantharides. I\r\nam not the first, I know, to describe the amorous preludes of the\r\nMeloid of the Ash-tree; but the change of narrator may give the\r\nnarrative a certain value: it confirms what has already been said and\r\nthrows light upon some points which may have escaped notice.\r\n\r\nA female Cantharides is peacefully nibbling her leaf. A lover comes\r\nupon the scene, approaches her from behind, suddenly mounts upon her\r\nback and embraces her with his two pairs of hind-legs. Then with his\r\nabdomen, which he lengthens as much as possible, he energetically\r\nslaps that of the female, on the right side and the left by turns. It\r\nis like the strokes of a washerwoman's bat, delivered with frenzied\r\nrapidity. With his antennae and his fore-legs, which remain free, he\r\nfuriously lashes the neck of the victim. While the blows fall thick as\r\nhail, in front and behind, the head and corselet of the amorous swain\r\nare shaken by an extravagant swaying and trembling. You would think\r\nthat the creature was having an epileptic fit.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the beloved makes herself small, opening her wing-cases\r\nslightly, hiding her head and tucking her abdomen under her, as though\r\nto escape the erotic thunderstorm that is bursting upon her back. But\r\nthe paroxysm calms down. The male extends his fore-legs, shaken by a\r\nnervous tremor, like the arms of a cross and in this ecstatic posture\r\nseems to call upon the heavens to witness the ardour of his desires.\r\nThe antennae and the belly are held motionless, in a straight line;\r\nthe head and the corselet alone continue to heave rapidly up and down.\r\nThis period of repose does not last long. Short as it is, the female,\r\nher appetite undisturbed by the passionate protestations of her wooer,\r\nimperturbably resumes the nibbling of her leaf.\r\n\r\nAnother paroxysm bursts forth. Once more the male's blows rain upon\r\nthe neck of the tightly-clasped victim, who hastens to bow her head\r\nupon her breast. But he has no intention of allowing his lady-love to\r\nescape. With his fore-legs, using a special notch placed at the\r\njuncture of the leg and the tarsus, he seizes both her antennae. The\r\ntarsus folds back; and the antennae are held as in a vice. The suitor\r\npulls; and the callous one is forced to raise her head. In this\r\nposture the male reminds one of a horseman proudly sitting his steed\r\nand holding the reins in both hands. Thus mastering his mount, he is\r\nsometimes motionless and sometimes frenzied in his demonstrations.\r\nThen, with his long abdomen, he lashes the female's hinder-parts,\r\nfirst on one side, then on the other; the front part he flogs, hammers\r\nand pounds with blows of his antennae, head and feet. The object of\r\nhis desires will be unfeeling indeed if she refuse to surrender to so\r\npassionate a declaration.\r\n\r\nNevertheless she still requires entreating. The impassioned lover\r\nresumes his ecstatic immobility, with his quivering arms outstretched\r\nlike the limbs of a cross. At brief intervals the amorous outbursts,\r\nwith blows conscientiously distributed, recur in alternation with\r\nperiods of repose, during which the male holds his fore-legs\r\ncrosswise, or else masters the female by the bridle of her antennae.\r\nAt last the flagellated beauty allows herself to be touched by the\r\ncharm attendant on his thumps. She yields. Coupling takes place and\r\nlasts for twenty hours. The heroic part of the male's performance is\r\nover. Dragged backwards behind the female, the poor fellow strives to\r\nuncouple himself. His mate carts him about from leaf to leaf, wherever\r\nshe pleases, so that she may choose the bit of green stuff to her\r\ntaste. Sometimes he also takes a gallant resolve and, like the female,\r\nbegins to browse. You lucky creatures, who, so as not to lose a moment\r\nof your four or five weeks' existence, yoke together the cravings of\r\nlove and hunger! Your motto is, \"A short life and a merry one.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cerocoma, who is a golden green like the Cantharides, seems to\r\nhave partly adopted the amorous rites of her rival in dress. The male,\r\nalways the elegant sex in the insect tribe, wears special ornaments.\r\nThe horns or antennae, magnificently complicated, form as it were two\r\ntufts of a thick head of hair. It is to this that the name Cerocoma\r\nrefers: the creature crested with its horns. When a bright sun shines\r\ninto the breeding-cage, it is not long before the insects form couples\r\non the bunch of everlastings. Hoisted on the female, whom he embraces\r\nand holds with his two pairs of hind-legs, the male sways his head and\r\ncorselet up and down, all in a piece. This oscillatory movement has\r\nnot the fiery precipitation of that of the Cantharides; it is calmer\r\nand as it were rhythmical. The abdomen moreover remains motionless and\r\nseems unskilled in those slaps, as of a washerwoman's bat, which the\r\namorous denizen of the ash-tree so vigorously distributes with his\r\nbelly.\r\n\r\nWhile the front half of the body swings up and down, the fore-legs\r\nexecute magnetic passes on either side of the tight-clasped female,\r\nmoving with a sort of twirl, so rapidly that the eye can hardly follow\r\nthem. The female appears insensible to this flagellatory twirl. She\r\ninnocently curls her antennae. The rejected suitor leaves her and\r\nmoves on to another. His dizzy, twirling passes, his protestations are\r\neverywhere refused. The moment has not yet arrived, or rather the spot\r\nis not propitious. Captivity appears to weigh upon the future mothers.\r\nBefore listening to their wooers they must have the open air, the\r\nsudden joyful flight from cluster to cluster on the sunlit slope, all\r\ngold with everlastings. Apart from the idyll of the twirling passes, a\r\nmitigated form of the Cantharides' blows, the Cerocoma refused to\r\nyield before my eyes to the last act of the bridal.\r\n\r\nAmong males the same oscillations of the body and the same lateral\r\nflagellations are frequently practised. While the upper one makes a\r\ntremendous to-do and whirls his legs, the one under him keeps quiet.\r\nSometimes a third scatterbrain comes on the scene, sometimes even a\r\nfourth, and mounts upon the heap of his predecessors. The uppermost\r\nbobs up and down and makes swift rowing-strokes with his fore-legs;\r\nthe others remain motionless. Thus are the sorrows of the rejected\r\nbeguiled for a moment.\r\n\r\nThe Zonites, a rude clan, grazing on the heads of the prickly eryngo,\r\ndespise all tender preliminaries. A few rapid vibrations of the\r\nantennae on the males' part; and that is all. The declaration could\r\nnot be briefer. The pairing, with the creatures placed end to end,\r\nlasts nearly an hour.\r\n\r\nThe Mylabres also must be very expeditious in their preliminaries, so\r\nmuch so that my cages, which were kept well-stocked for two summers,\r\nprovided me with numerous batches of eggs without giving me a single\r\nopportunity of catching the males in the least bit of a flirtation.\r\nLet us therefore consider the egg-laying.\r\n\r\nThis takes place in August for our two species of Mylabres. In the\r\nvegetable mould which does duty as a floor to the wire-gauze dome, the\r\nmother digs a pit four-fifths of an inch deep and as wide as her body.\r\nThis is the place for the eggs. The laying lasts barely half an hour.\r\nI have seen it last thirty-six hours with Sitares. This quickness of\r\nthe Mylabris points to an incomparably less numerous family. The\r\nhiding-place is next closed. The mother sweeps up the rubbish with her\r\nfore-legs, collects it with the rake of her mandibles and pushes it\r\nback into the pit, into which she now descends to stamp upon the\r\npowdery layer and cram it down with her hind-legs, which I see swiftly\r\nworking. When this layer is well packed, she starts raking together\r\nfresh material to complete the filling of the hole, which is carefully\r\ntrampled stratum by stratum.\r\n\r\nI take the mother from her pit while she is engaged in filling it up.\r\nDelicately, with the tip of a camel-hair pencil, I move her a couple\r\nof inches. The Beetle does not return to her batch of eggs, does not\r\neven look for it. She climbs up the wire gauze and proceeds to graze\r\namong her companions on the bindweed or scabious, without troubling\r\nherself further about her eggs, whose hiding-place is only\r\nhalf-filled. A second mother, whom I move only one inch, is no longer\r\nable to return to her task, or rather does not think of doing so. I\r\ntake a third, after shifting her just as slightly, and, while the\r\nforgetful creature is climbing up the trellis-work, bring her back to\r\nthe pit. I replace her with her head at the opening. The mother stands\r\nmotionless, looking thoroughly perplexed. She sways her head, passes\r\nher front tarsi through her mandibles, then moves away and climbs to\r\nthe top of the dome without attempting anything. In each of these\r\nthree cases I have to finish filling in the pit myself. What then are\r\nthis maternity, which the touch of a brush causes to forget its\r\nduties, and this memory, which is lost at a distance of an inch from\r\nthe spot? Compare with these shortcomings of the adult the expert\r\nmachinations of the primary larva, which knows where its victuals are\r\nand as its first action introduces itself into the dwelling of the\r\nhost that is to feed it. How can time and experience be factors of\r\ninstinct? The newborn animalcule amazes us with its foresight; the\r\nadult insect astonishes us with its stupidity.\r\n\r\nWith both Mylabres, the batch consists of some forty eggs, a very\r\nsmall number compared with those of the Oil-beetle and the Sitaris.\r\nThis limited family was already foreseen, judging by the short space\r\nof time which the egg-layer spends in her underground lodging. The\r\neggs of the Twelve-spotted Mylabris are white, cylindrical, rounded at\r\nboth ends and measure a millimetre and a half in length by half a\r\nmillimetre in width.[6] Those of the Four-spotted Mylabris are straw\r\ncoloured and of an elongated oval, a trifle fuller at one end than at\r\nthe other. Length, two millimetres; width, a little under one\r\nmillimetre.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: .058 x .019 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: .078 x .039 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nOf all the batches of eggs collected, one alone hatched. The rest were\r\nprobably sterile, a suspicion corroborated by the lack of pairing in\r\nthe breeding-cage. Laid at the end of July, the eggs of the\r\nTwelve-spotted Mylabris began to hatch on the 5th of September. The\r\nprimary larva of this Meloid is still unknown, so far as I am aware;\r\nand I shall describe it in detail. It will be the starting-point of a\r\nchapter which perhaps will give us some fresh sidelights upon the\r\nhistory of the hypermetamorphosis.\r\n\r\nThe larva is nearly 2 millimetres long.[8] Coming out of a good-sized\r\negg, it is endowed with greater vigour than the larvae of the Sitares\r\nand Oil-beetles. The head is large, rounded, slightly wider than the\r\nprothorax and of a rather brighter red. Mandibles powerful, sharp,\r\ncurved, with the ends crossing, of the same colour as the head, darker\r\nat the tips. Eyes black, prominent, globular, very distinct. Antennae\r\nfairly long, with three joints, the last thinner and pointed. Palpi\r\nvery much pronounced.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: .078 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThe first thoracic segment has very nearly the same diameter as the\r\nhead and is much longer than those which come after. It forms a sort\r\nof cuirass equal in length to almost three abdominal segments. It is\r\nsquared off in front in a straight line and is rounded at the sides\r\nand at the back. Its colour is bright red. The second ring is hardly a\r\nthird as long as the first. It is also red, but a little browner. The\r\nthird is dark brown, with a touch of green to it. This tint is\r\nrepeated throughout the abdomen, so that in the matter of colouring\r\nthe creature is divided into two sections: the front, which is a\r\nfairly bright red, includes the head and the first two thoracic\r\nsegments; the second, which is a greenish brown, includes the third\r\nthoracic segment and the nine abdominal rings.\r\n\r\nThe three pairs of legs are pale red, strong and long, considering the\r\ncreature's smallness. They end in a single long, sharp claw.\r\n\r\nThe abdomen has nine segments, all of an olive brown. The membranous\r\nspaces which connect them are white, so that, from the second thoracic\r\nring downwards, the tiny creature is alternatively ringed with white\r\nand olive brown. All the brown rings bristle with short, sparse hairs.\r\nThe anal segment, which is narrower than the rest, bears at the tip\r\ntwo long cirri, very fine, slightly waved and almost as long as the\r\nwhole abdomen.\r\n\r\nThis description enables us to picture a sturdy little creature,\r\ncapable of biting lustily with its mandibles, exploring the country\r\nwith its big eyes and moving about with six strong harpoons as a\r\nsupport. We no longer have to do with the puny louse of the\r\nOil-beetle, which lies in ambush on a cichoriaceous blossom in order\r\nto slip into the fleece of a harvesting Bee; nor with the black atom\r\nof the Sitaris, which swarms in a heap on the spot where it is\r\nhatched, at the Anthophora's door. I see the young Mylabris striding\r\neagerly up and down the glass tube in which it was born.\r\n\r\nWhat is it seeking? What does it want? I give it a Bee, a Halictus,[9]\r\nto see if it will settle on the insect, as the Sitares and Oil-beetles\r\nwould not fail to do. My offer is scorned. It is not a winged\r\nconveyance that my prisoners require.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Cf. _Bramble-bees and Others_: chaps. xii. to\r\nxiv.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThe primary larva of the Mylabris therefore does not imitate those of\r\nthe Sitaris and the Oil-beetle; it does not settle in the fleece of\r\nits host to get itself carried to the cell crammed with victuals. The\r\ntask of seeking and finding the heap of food falls upon its own\r\nshoulders. The small number of the eggs that constitute a batch also\r\nleads to the same conclusion. Remember that the primary larva of the\r\nOil-beetle, for instance, settles on any insect that happens to pay a\r\nmomentary visit to the flower in which the tiny creature is on the\r\nlook-out. Whether this visitor be hairy or smooth-skinned, a\r\nmanufacturer of honey, a canner of animal flesh or without any\r\ndetermined calling, whether she be Spider, Butterfly, Fly or Beetle\r\nmakes no difference: the instant the little yellow louse espies the\r\nnew arrival, it perches on her back and leaves with her. And now it\r\nall depends on luck! How many of these stray travellers must be lost;\r\nhow many will never be carried into a warehouse full of honey, their\r\nsole food! Therefore, to remedy this enormous waste, the mother\r\nproduces an innumerable family. The Oil-beetle's batch of eggs is\r\nprodigious. Prodigious too is that of the Sitaris, who is exposed to\r\nsimilar misadventures.\r\n\r\nIf, with her thirty or forty eggs, the Mylabris had to run the same\r\nrisks, perhaps not one larva would reach the desired goal. For so\r\nstrictly limited a family a safer method is needed. The young larva\r\nmust not get itself carried to the game-basket, or more probably to\r\nthe honey-pot, at the risk of never reaching it; it must travel on its\r\nown legs. Allowing myself to be guided by the logic of things, I shall\r\ntherefore complete the story of the Twelve-spotted Mylabris as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nThe mother lays her eggs underground near the spots frequented by the\r\nfoster-mothers. The recently-hatched young grubs leave their lodgings\r\nin September and travel within a restricted radius in search of\r\nburrows containing food. The little creature's sturdy legs allow of\r\nthese underground investigations. The mandibles, which are just as\r\nstrong, necessarily play their part. The parasite, on forcing its way\r\ninto the food-pit, finds itself faced with either the egg or the young\r\nlarva of the Bee. These are competitors, whom it is important to get\r\nrid of as quickly as possible. The hooks of the mandibles now come\r\ninto play, tearing the egg or the defenceless grub. After this act of\r\nbrigandage, which may be compared with that of the primary larva of\r\nthe Sitaris ripping open and drinking the contents of the Anthophora's\r\negg, the Meloid, now the sole possessor of the victuals, doffs its\r\nbattle array and becomes the pot-bellied grub, the consumer of the\r\nproperty so brutally acquired. These are merely suspicions on my part,\r\nnothing more. Direct observation will, I believe, confirm them, so\r\nclose is their connection with the known facts.\r\n\r\nTwo Zonites, both visitors of the eryngo-heads during the heats of\r\nsummer, are among the Meloidae of my part of the country. They are\r\n_Zonitis mutica_ and _Z. praeusta_. I have spoken of the first in\r\nanother volume;[10] I have mentioned its pseudochrysalis found in the\r\ncells of two Osmiae, namely, the Three-pronged Osmia, which piles its\r\ncells in a dry bramble-stem, and the Three-horned Osmia and also\r\nLatreille's Osmia, both of which exploit the nests of the Chalicodoma\r\nof the Sheds. The second Zonitis is to-day adding its quota of\r\nevidence to a story which is still very incomplete. I have obtained\r\nthe Burnt Zonitis, in the first place, from the cotton pouches of\r\n_Anthidium scapulare_, who, like the Three-toothed Osmia, makes her\r\nnests in the brambles; in the second place, from the wallets of\r\n_Megachile sericans_, made with little round disks of the leaves of\r\nthe common acacia; in the third place, from the cells which _Anthidium\r\nbellicosum_[11] builds with partitions of resin in the shell of a dead\r\nSnail. This last Anthidium is the victim also of the Unarmed Zonitis.\r\nThus we have two closely-related exploiters for the same victim.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Cf. _Bramble-bees and Others_: chaps. i., iii. and\r\nx.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: For the Cotton-bee, Leaf-cutter and Resin-bee mentioned,\r\ncf. _Bramble-bees and Others_: _passim_.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nDuring the last fortnight of July, I witness the emergence of the\r\nBurnt Zonitis from the pseudochrysalis. The latter is cylindrical,\r\nslightly curved and rounded at both ends. It is closely wrapped in the\r\ncast skin of the secondary larva, a skin consisting of a diaphanous\r\nbag, without any outlet, with running along each side a white tracheal\r\nthread which connects the various stigmatic apertures. I easily\r\nrecognize the seven abdominal stigmata; they are round and diminish\r\nslightly in width from front to back. I also detect the thoracic\r\nstigma. Lastly, I perceive the legs, which are quite small, with weak\r\nclaws, incapable of supporting the creature. Of the mouth-parts I see\r\nplainly only the mandibles, which are short, weak and brown. In short,\r\nthe secondary larva was soft, white, big-bellied, blind, with\r\nrudimentary legs. Similar results were furnished by the shed skin of\r\nthe secondary larva of _Zonitis mutica_, consisting, like the other,\r\nof a bag without an opening, fitting closely over the pseudochrysalis.\r\n\r\nLet us continue our examination of the relics of the Burnt Zonitis.\r\nThe pseudochrysalis is red, the colour of a cough-lozenge. It remains\r\nintact after opening, except in front, where the adult insect has\r\nemerged. In shape it is a cylindrical bag, with firm, elastic walls.\r\nThe segmentation is plainly visible. The magnifying-glass shows the\r\nfine star-shaped dots already observed in the Unarmed Zonitis. The\r\nstigmatic apertures have a projecting, dark-red rim. They are all,\r\neven the last, clearly marked. The signs of the legs are mere studs,\r\nhardly protruding, a little darker than the rest of the skin. The\r\ncephalic mask is reduced to a few mouldings which are not easy to\r\ndistinguish.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of this pseudochrysalidal sheath I find a little white\r\nwad which, when placed in water, softened and then patiently\r\nunravelled with the tip of a paint-brush, yields a white, powdery\r\nsubstance, which is uric acid, the usual product of the work of the\r\nnymphosis, and a rumpled membrane, in which I recognize the cast skin\r\nof the nymph. There should still be the tertiary larva, of which I see\r\nnot a trace. But, on taking a needle and gradually breaking the\r\nenvelope of the pseudochrysalis, after soaking it awhile in water, I\r\nsee it dividing into two layers, one an outer layer, brittle, horny in\r\nappearance and currant-red; the other an inner layer, consisting of a\r\ntransparent, flexible pellicle. There can be no doubt that this inner\r\nlayer represents the tertiary larva, whose skin is left adhering to\r\nthe envelope of the pseudochrysalis. It is fairly thick and tough, but\r\nI cannot detach it except in shreds, so closely does it adhere to the\r\nhorny, crumbly sheath.\r\n\r\nSince I possessed a fair number of pseudochrysalids, I sacrificed a\r\nfew in order to ascertain their contents on the approach of the final\r\ntransformations. Well, I never found anything that I could detach; I\r\nnever succeeded in extracting a larva in its tertiary form, though\r\nthis larva is so easily obtained from the amber pouches of the Sitares\r\nand, in the Oil-beetles and Cerocomae, emerges of its own accord from\r\nthe split wrapper of the pseudochrysalis. When, for the first time,\r\nthe stiff shell encloses a body which does not adhere to the rest,\r\nthis body is a nymph and nothing else. The wall surrounding it is a\r\ndull white inside. I attribute this colouring to the cast skin of the\r\ntertiary larva, which was inseparably fixed to the shell of the\r\npseudochrysalis.\r\n\r\nThe Zonites, therefore, display a peculiarity which is not offered by\r\nthe other Meloidae, namely, a series of tightly-fitting shells, one\r\nwithin the other. The pseudochrysalis is enclosed in the skin of the\r\nsecondary larva, a skin which forms a pouch without an orifice, fitted\r\nvery closely to its contents. The slough of the tertiary larva fits\r\neven more closely to the inner surface of the pseudochrysalid sheath.\r\nThe nymph alone does not adhere to its envelope. In the Cerocomae and\r\nthe Oil-beetles, each form of the hypermetamorphosis becomes detached\r\nfrom the preceding skin by a complete extraction; the contents are\r\nremoved from the ruptured container and have no further connection\r\nwith it. In the Sitares, the successive casts are not ruptured and\r\nremain enclosed inside one another, but with an interval between, so\r\nthat the tertiary larva can move and turn as it wishes in its multiple\r\nenclosure. In the Zonites, there is the same arrangement, with this\r\ndifference, that, until the nymph appears, there is no empty space\r\nbetween one slough and the next. The tertiary larva cannot budge. It\r\nis not free, as witness its cast skin, which fits so precisely to the\r\nenvelope of the pseudochrysalis. This form would therefore pass\r\nunperceived if its existence were not proclaimed by the membrane which\r\nlines the inside of the pseudochrysalid pouch.\r\n\r\nTo complete the story of the Zonites, the primary larva is lacking. I\r\ndo not yet know it, for, when rearing the insect under wire-gauze\r\ncovers, I never succeeded in obtaining a batch of eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nTHE CAPRICORN\r\n\r\n\r\nMy youthful meditations owe some happy moments to Condillac's[1]\r\nfamous statue which, when endowed with the sense of smell, inhales the\r\nscent of a rose and out of that single impression creates a whole\r\nworld of ideas. My twenty-year-old mind, full of faith in syllogisms,\r\nloved to follow the deductive jugglery of the abbe-philosopher: I saw,\r\nor seemed to see, the statue take life in that action of the nostrils,\r\nacquiring attention, memory, judgment and all the psychological\r\nparaphernalia, even as still waters are aroused and rippled by the\r\nimpact of a grain of sand. I recovered from my illusion under the\r\ninstruction of my abler master, the animal. The Capricorn shall teach\r\nus that the problem is more obscure than the abbe led me to believe.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Etienne Bonnot de Condillac, Abbe de Mureaux (1715-1780),\r\nthe leading exponent of sensational philosophy. His most important\r\nwork is the _Traite des sensations_, in which he imagines a statue,\r\norganized like a man, and endows it with the senses one by one,\r\nbeginning with that of smell. He argues by a process of imaginative\r\nreconstruction that all human faculties and all human knowledge are\r\nmerely transformed sensation, to the exclusion of any other principle,\r\nthat, in short, everything has its source in sensation: man is nothing\r\nbut what he has acquired.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nWhen wedge and mallet are at work, preparing my provision of firewood\r\nunder the grey sky that heralds winter, a favourite relaxation creates\r\na welcome break in my daily output of prose. By my express orders, the\r\nwoodman has selected the oldest and most ravaged trunks in his stack.\r\nMy tastes bring a smile to his lips; he wonders by what whimsy I\r\nprefer wood that is worm-eaten, _chirouna_, as he calls it, to sound\r\nwood, which burns so much better. I have my views on the subject; and\r\nthe worthy man submits to them.\r\n\r\nAnd now to us two, O my fine oak-trunk seamed with scars, gashed with\r\nwounds whence trickle the brown drops smelling of the tan-yard. The\r\nmallet drives home, the wedges bite, the wood splits. What do your\r\nflanks contain? Real treasures for my studies. In the dry and hollow\r\nparts, groups of various insects, capable of living through the bad\r\nseason of the year, have taken up their winter quarters: in the\r\nlow-roofed galleries, galleries built by some Buprestis Beetle,\r\nOsmiae, working their paste of masticated leaves, have piled their\r\ncells one above the other; in the deserted chambers and vestibules,\r\nMegachiles have arranged their leafy jars; in the live wood, filled\r\nwith juicy saps, the larvae of the Capricorn (_Cerambyx miles_), the\r\nchief author of the oak's undoing, have set up their home.\r\n\r\nStrange creatures, of a verity, are these grubs, for an insect of\r\nsuperior organization: bits of intestines crawling about! At this time\r\nof year, the middle of autumn, I meet them of two different ages. The\r\nolder are almost as thick as one's finger; the others hardly attain\r\nthe diameter of a pencil. I find, in addition, pupae more or less\r\nfully coloured, perfect insects, with a distended abdomen, ready to\r\nleave the trunk when the hot weather comes again. Life inside the\r\nwood, therefore, lasts three years. How is this long period of\r\nsolitude and captivity spent? In wandering lazily through the\r\nthickness of the oak, in making roads whose rubbish serves as food.\r\nThe horse in Job swallows the ground[2] in a figure of speech; the\r\nCapricorn's grub eats its way literally. With its carpenter's-gouge, a\r\nstrong black mandible, short, devoid of notches, scooped into a\r\nsharp-edged spoon, it digs the opening of its tunnel. The piece cut\r\nout is a mouthful which, as it enters the stomach, yields its scanty\r\njuices and accumulates behind the worker in heaps of wormed wood. The\r\nrefuse leaves room in front by passing through the worker. A labour at\r\nonce of nutrition and of road-making, the path is devoured while\r\nconstructed; it is blocked behind as it makes way ahead. That,\r\nhowever, is how all the borers who look to wood for victuals and\r\nlodging set about their business.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"Chafing and raging, he swalloweth the ground, neither\r\ndoth he make account when the noise of the trumpet soundeth.\"--Job,\r\nxxxix, 23 (Douai version).--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nFor the harsh work of its two gouges, or curved chisels, the larva of\r\nthe Capricorn concentrates its muscular strength in the front of its\r\nbody, which swells into a pestle-head. The Buprestis-grubs, those\r\nother industrious carpenters, adopt a similar form; they even\r\nexaggerate their pestle. The part that toils and carves hard wood\r\nrequires a robust structure; the rest of the body, which has but to\r\nfollow after, continues slim. The essential thing is that the\r\nimplement of the jaws should possess a solid support and a powerful\r\nmotor. The Cerambyx-larva strengthens its chisels with a stout, black,\r\nhorny armour that surrounds the mouth; yet, apart from its skull and\r\nits equipment of tools, the grub has a skin as fine as satin and as\r\nwhite as ivory. This dead white comes from a copious layer of grease\r\nwhich the animal's spare diet would not lead us to suspect. True, it\r\nhas nothing to do, at every hour of the day and night, but gnaw. The\r\nquantity of wood that passes into its stomach makes up for the dearth\r\nof nourishing elements.\r\n\r\nThe legs, consisting of three pieces, the first globular, the last\r\nsharp-pointed, are mere rudiments, vestiges. They are hardly a\r\nmillimetre[3] long. For this reason, they are of no use whatever for\r\nwalking; they do not even bear upon the supporting surface, being kept\r\noff it by the obesity of the chest. The organs of locomotion are\r\nsomething altogether different. The Cetonia-grub[4] has shown us how,\r\nwith the aid of the hairs and the pad-like excrescences upon its\r\nspine, it manages to reverse the universally-accepted usage and to\r\nwriggle along on its back. The grub of the Capricorn is even more\r\ningenious: it moves at the same time on its back and belly; instead of\r\nthe useless legs of the thorax, it has a walking-apparatus almost\r\nresembling feet, which appear, contrary to every rule, on the dorsal\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: .039 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: For the grub of the Cetonia, or Rose-chafer, cf. _The\r\nLife and Love of the Insect_, by J. Henri Fabre, translated by\r\nAlexander Teixeira de Mattos: chap. xi.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThe first seven segments of the abdomen have, both above and below, a\r\nfour-sided facet, bristling with rough protuberances. This the grub\r\ncan either expand or contract, making it stick out or lie flat at\r\nwill. The upper facets consist of two excrescences separated by the\r\nmid-dorsal line; the lower ones have not this divided appearance.\r\nThese are the organs of locomotion, the ambulacra. When the larva\r\nwishes to move forwards, it expands its hinder ambulacra, those on the\r\nback as well as those on the belly, and contracts its front ones.\r\nFixed to the side of the narrow gallery by their ridges, the hind-pads\r\ngive the grub a purchase. The flattening of the fore-pads, by\r\ndecreasing the diameter, allows it to slip forward and to take half a\r\nstep. To complete the step, the hind-quarters have to be brought up\r\nthe same distance. With this object, the front pads fill out and\r\nprovide support, while those behind shrink and leave free scope for\r\ntheir segments to contract.\r\n\r\nWith the double support of its back and belly, with alternate puffings\r\nand shrinkings, the animal easily advances or retreats along its\r\ngallery, a sort of mould which the contents fill without a gap. But,\r\nif the locomotory pads grip only on one side, progress becomes\r\nimpossible. When placed on the smooth wood of my table, the animal\r\nwriggles slowly; it lengthens and shortens without advancing by a\r\nhair's-breadth. Laid on the surface of a piece of split oak, a rough,\r\nuneven surface, due to the gash made by the wedge, it twists and\r\nwrithes, moves the front part of its body very slowly from left to\r\nright and right to left, lifts it a little, lowers it and begins\r\nagain. These are the most extensive movements made. The vestigial legs\r\nremain inert and absolutely useless.\r\n\r\nThen why are they there? Better to lose them altogether, if it be true\r\nthat crawling inside the oak has deprived the animal of the good legs\r\nwith which it started. The influence of environment, so well-inspired\r\nin endowing the grub with ambulatory pads, becomes a mockery when it\r\nleaves it these ridiculous stumps. Can the structure, perchance, be\r\nobeying other rules than those of environment?\r\n\r\nThough the useless legs, the germs of the future limbs, persist, there\r\nis no sign in the grub of the eyes wherewith the Cerambyx will be\r\nrichly gifted. The larva has not the least trace of organs of vision.\r\nWhat would it do with sight, in the murky thickness of a tree-trunk?\r\nHearing is likewise absent. In the never-troubled silence of the oak's\r\ninmost heart, the sense of hearing would be a non-sense. Where sounds\r\nare lacking, of what use is the faculty of discerning them? Should\r\nthere be any doubts, I will reply to them with the following\r\nexperiment. Split lengthwise, the grub's abode leaves a half-tunnel\r\nwherein I can watch the occupant's doings. When left alone, it now\r\ngnaws the front of its gallery, now rests, fixed by its ambulacra to\r\nthe two sides of the channel. I avail myself of these moments of quiet\r\nto enquire into its power of perceiving sounds. The banging of hard\r\nbodies, the ring of metallic objects, the grating of a file upon a saw\r\nare tried in vain. The animal remains impassive. Not a wince, not a\r\nmove of the skin; no sign of awakened attention. I succeed no better\r\nwhen I scratch the wood close by with a hard point, to imitate the\r\nsound of some neighbouring larva gnawing the intervening thickness.\r\nThe indifference to my noisy tricks could be no greater in a lifeless\r\nobject. The animal is deaf.\r\n\r\nCan it smell? Everything tells us no. Scent is of assistance in the\r\nsearch for food. But the Capricorn-grub need not go in quest of\r\neatables: it feeds on its home, it lives on the wood that gives it\r\nshelter. Let us make an attempt or two, however. I scoop in a log of\r\nfresh cypress-wood a groove of the same diameter as that of the\r\nnatural galleries and I place the worm inside it. Cypress-wood is\r\nstrongly-scented; it possesses in a high degree that resinous aroma\r\nwhich characterizes most of the pine family. Well, when laid in the\r\nodoriferous channel, the larva goes to the end, as far as it can go,\r\nand makes no further movement. Does not this placid quiescence point\r\nto the absence of a sense of smell? The resinous flavour, so strange\r\nto the grub which has always lived in oak, ought to vex it, to trouble\r\nit; and the disagreeable impression ought to be revealed by a certain\r\ncommotion, by certain attempts to get away. Well, nothing of the kind\r\nhappens: once the larva has found the right position in the groove, it\r\ndoes not stir. I do more: I set before it, at a very short distance,\r\nin its normal canal, a piece of camphor. Again, no effect. Camphor is\r\nfollowed by naphthaline. Still nothing. After these fruitless\r\nendeavours, I do not think that I am going too far when I deny the\r\ncreature a sense of smell.\r\n\r\nTaste is there, no doubt. But such taste! The food is without variety:\r\noak, for three years at a stretch, and nothing else. What can the\r\ngrub's palate appreciate in this monotonous fare? The tannic relish of\r\na fresh piece, oozing with sap; the uninteresting flavour of an\r\nover-dry piece, robbed of its natural condiment: these probably\r\nrepresent the whole gustative scale.\r\n\r\nThere remains touch, the far-spreading passive sense common to all\r\nlive flesh that quivers under the goad of pain. The sensitive schedule\r\nof the Cerambyx-grub, therefore, is limited to taste and touch, both\r\nexceedingly obtuse. This almost brings us to Condillac's statue. The\r\nimaginary being of the philosopher had one sense only, that of smell,\r\nequal in delicacy to our own; the real being, the ravager of the oak,\r\nhas two, inferior, even when put together, to the former, which so\r\nplainly perceived the scent of a rose and distinguished it so clearly\r\nfrom any other. The real case will bear comparison with the\r\nfictitious.\r\n\r\nWhat can be the psychology of a creature possessing such a powerful\r\ndigestive organism combined with such a feeble set of senses? A vain\r\nwish has often come to me in my dreams: it is to be able to think, for\r\na few minutes, with the crude brain of my Dog, to see the world with\r\nthe faceted eyes of a Gnat. How things would change in appearance!\r\nThey would change much more if interpreted by the intellect of the\r\ngrub. What have the lessons of touch and taste contributed to that\r\nrudimentary receptacle of impressions? Very little; almost nothing.\r\nThe animal knows that the best bits possess an astringent flavour;\r\nthat the sides of a passage not carefully planed are painful to the\r\nskin. This is the utmost limit of its acquired wisdom. In comparison,\r\nthe statue with the sensitive nostrils was a marvel of knowledge, a\r\nparagon too generously endowed by its inventor. It remembered,\r\ncompared, judged, reasoned: does the drowsy, digesting paunch\r\nremember? Does it compare? Does it reason? I defined the\r\nCapricorn-grub as a bit of an intestine that crawls about. The\r\nundeniable accuracy of this definition provides me with my answer: the\r\ngrub has the aggregate of sense-impressions that a bit of an intestine\r\nmay hope to have.\r\n\r\nAnd this nothing-at-all is capable of marvellous acts of foresight;\r\nthis belly, which knows hardly anything of the present, sees very\r\nclearly into the future. Let us take an illustration on this curious\r\nsubject. For three years on end, the larva wanders about in the thick\r\nof the trunk; it goes up, goes down, turns to this side and that; it\r\nleaves one vein for another of better flavour, but without moving too\r\nfar from the inner depths, where the temperature is milder and greater\r\nsafety reigns. A day is at hand, a dangerous day for the recluse\r\nobliged to quit its excellent retreat and face the perils of the\r\nsurface. Eating is not everything: we have to get out of this. The\r\nlarva, so well-equipped with tools and muscular strength, finds no\r\ndifficulty in going where it pleases, by boring through the wood; but\r\ndoes the coming Capricorn, whose short spell of life must be spent in\r\nthe open air, possess the same advantages? Hatched inside the trunk,\r\nwill the long-horned Beetle be able to clear itself a way of escape?\r\n\r\nThat is the difficulty which the worm solves by inspiration. Less\r\nversed in things of the future, despite my gleams of reason, I resort\r\nto experiment with a view to fathoming the question. I begin by\r\nascertaining that the Capricorn, when he wishes to leave the trunk, is\r\nabsolutely unable to make use of the tunnel wrought by the larva. It\r\nis a very long and very irregular maze, blocked with great heaps of\r\nwormed wood. Its diameter decreases progressively from the final blind\r\nalley to the starting-point. The larva entered the timber as slim as a\r\ntiny bit of straw; it is to-day as thick as one's finger. In its three\r\nyears' wanderings, it always dug its gallery according to the mould of\r\nits body. Evidently, the road by which the larva entered and moved\r\nabout cannot be the Capricorn's exit-way: his immoderate antennae, his\r\nlong legs, his inflexible armour-plates would encounter an insuperable\r\nobstacle in the narrow, winding corridor, which would have to be\r\ncleared of its wormed wood and, moreover, greatly enlarged. It would\r\nbe less fatiguing to attack the untouched timber and dig straight\r\nahead. Is the insect capable of doing so? We shall see.\r\n\r\nI make some chambers of suitable size in oak logs chopped in two; and\r\neach of my artificial cells receives a newly-transformed Cerambyx,\r\nsuch as my provisions of firewood supply, when split by the wedge, in\r\nOctober. The two pieces are then joined and kept together with a few\r\nbands of wire. June comes. I hear a scraping inside my billets. Will\r\nthe Capricorns come out, or not? The delivery does not seem difficult\r\nto me: there is hardly three-quarters of an inch to pierce. Not one\r\nemerges. When all is silence, I open my apparatus. The captives, from\r\nfirst to last, are dead. A vestige of sawdust, less than a pinch of\r\nsnuff, represents all their work.\r\n\r\nI expected more from those sturdy tools, their mandibles. But, as we\r\nhave seen before, the tool does not make the workman.[5] In spite of\r\ntheir boring-implements, the hermits die in my cases for lack of\r\nskill. I subject others to less arduous tests. I enclose them in\r\nspacious reed-stumps, equal in diameter to the natal cell. The\r\nobstacle to be pierced is the natural diaphragm, a yielding partition\r\ntwo or three millimetres[6] thick. Some free themselves; others\r\ncannot. The less valiant ones succumb, stopped by the frail barrier.\r\nWhat would it be if they had to pass through a thickness of oak?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Cf. _The Life and Love of the Insect_: chap. iii. \"The\r\ntool does not make the workman. The insect exerts its gifts as a\r\nspecialist with any kind of tool wherewith it is supplied. It can saw\r\nwith a plane or plane with a saw, like the model workman of whom\r\nFranklin tells us.\"--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: .078 to .117 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nWe are now persuaded: despite his stalwart appearance, the Capricorn\r\nis powerless to leave the tree-trunk by his unaided efforts. It\r\ntherefore falls to the worm, to the wisdom of that bit of an\r\nintestine, to prepare the way for him. We see renewed, in another\r\nform, the feats of prowess of the Anthrax, whose pupa, armed with\r\ntrepans, bores through rock on the feeble Fly's behalf. Urged by a\r\npresentiment that to us remains an unfathomable mystery, the\r\nCerambyx-grub leaves the inside of the oak, its peaceful retreat, its\r\nunassailable stronghold, to wriggle towards the outside, where lives\r\nthe foe, the Woodpecker, who may gobble up the succulent little\r\nsausage. At the risk of its life, it stubbornly digs and gnaws to the\r\nvery bark, of which it leaves no more intact than the thinnest film, a\r\nslender screen. Sometimes, even, the rash one opens the window wide.\r\n\r\nThis is the Capricorn's doorway. The insect will have but to file the\r\nscreen a little with its mandibles, to bump against it with its\r\nforehead, in order to bring it down; it will even have nothing to do\r\nwhen the window is free, as often happens. The unskilled carpenter,\r\nburdened with his extravagant head-dress, will emerge from the\r\ndarkness through this opening when the summer heats arrive.\r\n\r\nAfter the cares of the future come the cares of the present. The\r\nlarva, which has just opened the aperture of escape, retreats some\r\ndistance down its gallery and, in the side of the exit-way, digs\r\nitself a transformation-chamber more sumptuously furnished and\r\nbarricaded than any that I have ever seen. It is a roomy niche, shaped\r\nlike a flattened ellipsoid, the length of which reaches some eighty to\r\na hundred millimetres.[7] The two axes of the cross-section vary: the\r\nhorizontal measures twenty-five to thirty millimetres;[8] the vertical\r\nmeasures only fifteen.[9] This greater dimension of the cell, where\r\nthe thickness of the perfect insect is concerned, leaves a certain\r\nscope for the action of its legs when the time comes for forcing the\r\nbarricade, which is more than a close-fitting mummy-case would do.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: 3 to 4 inches.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: .975 to 1.17 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: .585 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThe barricade in question, a door which the larva builds to exclude\r\nthe dangers from without, is two- and even three-fold. Outside, it is\r\na stack of woody refuse, of particles of chopped timber; inside, a\r\nmineral hatch, a concave cover, all in one piece, of a chalky white.\r\nPretty often, but not always, there is added to these two layers an\r\ninner casing of shavings. Behind this compound door, the larva makes\r\nits arrangements for the metamorphosis. The sides of the chamber are\r\nrasped, thus providing a sort of down formed of ravelled woody fibres,\r\nbroken into minute shreds. The velvety matter, as and when obtained,\r\nis applied to the wall in a continuous felt at least a millimetre\r\nthick.[10] The chamber is thus padded throughout with a fine\r\nswan's-down, a delicate precaution taken by the rough worm on behalf\r\nof the tender pupa.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: .039 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nLet us hark back to the most curious part of the furnishing, the\r\nmineral hatch or inner door of the entrance. It is an elliptical\r\nskull-cap, white and hard as chalk, smooth within and knotted without,\r\nresembling more or less closely an acorn-cup. The knots show that the\r\nmatter is supplied in small, pasty mouthfuls, solidifying outside in\r\nslight projections which the animal does not remove, being unable to\r\nget at them, and polished on the inside surface, which is within the\r\nworm's reach. What can be the nature of that singular lid whereof the\r\nCerambyx furnishes me with the first specimen? It is as hard and\r\nbrittle as a flake of lime-stone. It can be dissolved cold in nitric\r\nacid, discharging little gaseous bubbles. The process of solution is a\r\nslow one, requiring several hours for a tiny fragment. Everything is\r\ndissolved, except a few yellowish flocks, which appear to be of an\r\norganic nature. As a matter of fact, a piece of the lid, when\r\nsubjected to heat, blackens, which proves the presence of an organic\r\nglue cementing the mineral matter. The solution becomes muddy if\r\noxalate of ammonia be added and deposits a copious white precipitate.\r\nThese signs indicate calcium carbonate. I look for urate of ammonia,\r\nthat constantly-recurring product of the various stages of the\r\nmetamorphoses. It is not there: I find not the least trace of\r\nmurexide. The lid, therefore, is composed solely of carbonate of lime\r\nand of an organic cement, no doubt of an albuminous character, which\r\ngives consistency to the chalky paste.\r\n\r\nHad circumstances served me better, I should have tried to discover in\r\nwhich of the worm's organs the stony deposit dwells. I am, however,\r\nconvinced: it is the stomach, the chylific ventricle, that supplies\r\nthe chalk. It keeps it separate from the food, either as original\r\nmatter or as a derivative of the ammonium urate; it purges it of all\r\nforeign bodies, when the larval period comes to an end, and holds it\r\nin reserve until the time comes to disgorge it. This freestone-factory\r\ncauses me no astonishment: when the manufacturer undergoes his change,\r\nit serves for various chemical works. Certain Oil-beetles, such as the\r\nSitaris, locate in it the urate of ammonia, the refuse of the\r\ntransformed organism; the Sphex, the Pelopaei, the Scoliae,[11] use it\r\nto manufacture the shellac wherewith the silk of the cocoon is\r\nvarnished. Further investigations will only swell the aggregate of the\r\nproducts of this obliging organ.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Three species of Digger-wasps.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nWhen the exit-way is prepared and the cell upholstered in velvet and\r\nclosed with a three-fold barricade, the industrious worm has concluded\r\nits task. It lays aside its tools, sheds its skin and becomes a nymph,\r\na pupa, weakness personified, in swaddling-clothes, on a soft couch.\r\nThe head is always turned towards the door. This is a trifling detail\r\nin appearance; but it is everything in reality. To lie this way or\r\nthat in the long cell is a matter of great indifference to the worm,\r\nwhich is very supple, turning easily in its narrow lodging and\r\nadopting whatever position it pleases. The coming Capricorn will not\r\nenjoy the same privileges. Stiffly girt in his horn cuirass, he will\r\nnot be able to turn from end to end; he will not even be capable of\r\nbending, if some sudden wind should make the passage difficult. He\r\nmust absolutely find the door in front of him, lest he perish in the\r\ncasket. Should the grub forget this little formality, should it lie\r\ndown to its nymphal sleep with its head at the back of the cell, the\r\nCapricorn is infallibly lost: his cradle becomes a hopeless dungeon.\r\n\r\nBut there is no fear of this danger: the knowledge of the bit of an\r\nintestine is too sound in things of the future for the grub to neglect\r\nthe formality of keeping its head to the door. At the end of spring,\r\nthe Capricorn, now in possession of his full strength, dreams of the\r\njoys of the sun, of the festivals of light. He wants to get out. What\r\ndoes he find before him? A heap of filings easily dispersed with his\r\nclaws; next, a stone lid which he need not even break into fragments:\r\nit comes undone in one piece; it is removed from its frame with a few\r\npushes of the forehead, a few tugs of the claws. In fact, I find the\r\nlid intact on the threshold of the abandoned cells. Last comes a\r\nsecond mass of woody remnants as easy to disperse as the first. The\r\nroad is now free: the Cerambyx has but to follow the spacious\r\nvestibule, which will lead him, without the possibility of mistake, to\r\nthe exit. Should the window not be open, all that he has to do is to\r\ngnaw through a thin screen: an easy task; and behold him outside, his\r\nlong antennae aquiver with excitement.\r\n\r\nWhat have we learnt from him? Nothing from him; much from his grub.\r\nThis grub, so poor in sensory organs, gives us with its prescience no\r\nlittle food for reflection. It knows that the coming Beetle will not\r\nbe able to cut himself a road through the oak and it bethinks itself\r\nof opening one for him at its own risk and peril. It knows that the\r\nCerambyx, in his stiff armour, will never be able to turn and make for\r\nthe orifice of the cell; and it takes care to fall into its nymphal\r\nsleep with its head to the door. It knows how soft the pupa's flesh\r\nwill be and upholsters the bedroom with velvet. It knows that the\r\nenemy is likely to break in during the slow work of the transformation\r\nand, to set a bulwark against his attacks, it stores a calcium pap\r\ninside its stomach. It knows the future with a clear vision, or, to be\r\naccurate, behaves as though it knew the future. Whence did it derive\r\nthe motives of its actions? Certainly not from the experience of the\r\nsenses. What does it know of the outside world? Let us repeat, as much\r\nas a bit of an intestine can know. And this sense-less creature\r\nastounds us! I regret that the clever logician, instead of conceiving\r\na statue smelling a rose, did not imagine it gifted with some\r\ninstinct. How quickly he would have recognized that, quite apart from\r\nsense-impressions, the animal, including man, possesses certain\r\npsychological resources, certain inspirations that are innate and not\r\nacquired!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF THE SIREX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cherry-tree supports a small jet-black Capricorn, _Cerambyx\r\ncerdo_, whose larval habits it was as well to study in order to learn\r\nwhether the instincts are modified when the form and the organization\r\nremain identical. Has this pigmy of the family the same talents as the\r\ngiant, the ravager of the oak-tree? Does it work on the same\r\nprinciples? The resemblance between the two, both in the larval state\r\nand in that of the perfect insect, is complete; the denizen of the\r\ncherry-tree is an exact replica, on a smaller scale, of the denizen of\r\nthe oak. If instinct is the inevitable consequence of the organism, we\r\nought to find in the two insects a strict similarity of habits; if\r\ninstinct is, on the other hand, a special aptitude favoured by the\r\norgans, we must expect variations in the industry exercised. For the\r\nsecond time the alternative is forced upon our attention: do the\r\nimplements govern the practice of the craft, or does the craft govern\r\nthe employment of the implements? Is instinct derived from the organ,\r\nor is the organ instinct's servant? An old dead cherry-tree will\r\nanswer our question.\r\n\r\nBeneath its ragged bark, which I lift in wide strips, swarms a\r\npopulation of larvae all belonging to _Cerambyx cerdo_. There are big\r\nlarvae and little larvae; moreover, they are accompanied by nymphs.\r\nThese details tell us of three years of larval existence, a duration\r\nof life frequent in the Longicorn series. If we hunt the thick of the\r\ntrunk, splitting it again and again, it does not show us a single grub\r\nanywhere; the entire population is encamped between the bark and the\r\nwood. Here we find an inextricable maze of winding galleries, crammed\r\nwith packed sawdust, crossing, recrossing, shrinking into little\r\nalleys, expanding into wide spaces and cutting, on the one hand, into\r\nthe surface layer of the sap-wood and, on the other, into the thin\r\nsheets of the inner bark. The position speaks for itself: the larva of\r\nthe little Capricorn has other tastes than its large kinsman's; for\r\nthree years it gnaws the outside of the trunk beneath the thin\r\ncovering of the bark, while the other seeks a deeper refuge and gnaws\r\nthe inside.\r\n\r\nThe dissimilarity is yet more marked in the preparations for the\r\nnymphosis. Then the worm of the cherry-tree leaves the surface and\r\npenetrates into the wood to a depth of about two inches, leaving\r\nbehind it a wide passage, which is hidden on the outside by a remnant\r\nof bark that has been discreetly spared. This spacious vestibule is\r\nthe future insect's path of release; this screen of bark, easily\r\ndestroyed, is the curtain that masks the exit-door. In the heart of\r\nthe wood the larva finally scoops out the chamber destined for the\r\nnymphosis. This is an egg-shaped recess an inch and a quarter to an\r\ninch and three-quarters in length by two-fifths of an inch in\r\ndiameter. The walls are bare, that is to say, they are not lined with\r\nthe blanket of shredded fibres dear to the Capricorn of the Oak. The\r\nentrance is blocked first by a plug of fibrous sawdust, then by a\r\nchalky lid, similar, except in point of size, to that with which we\r\nare already familiar. A thick layer of fine sawdust packed into the\r\nconcavity of the chalky lid, completes the barricade. Need I add that\r\nthe grub lies down and goes to sleep, for the nymphosis, with its head\r\nagainst the door? Not one forgets to take this precaution.\r\n\r\nThe two Capricorns have, in short, the same system of closing their\r\ncells. Note above all the lens-shaped stony lid. In each case we find\r\nthe same chemical composition, the same formation, like the cup of an\r\nacorn. Dimensions apart, the two structures are identical. But no\r\nother genus of Longicorn, so far as I am aware, practises this craft.\r\nI will therefore complete the classic description of the\r\nCerambyx-beetles by adding one characteristic: they seal their\r\nmetamorphosis-chambers with a chalk slab.\r\n\r\nThe similarities of habit go no farther, despite the identity of\r\nstructure. There is even a very sharp contrast between the methods\r\npursued. The Capricorn of the Oak inhabits the deep layers of the\r\ntrunk; the Capricorn of the Cherry-tree inhabits the surface. In the\r\npreparations for the transformation, the first ascends from the wood\r\nto the bark, the second descends from the bark to the wood; the first\r\nrisks the perils of the outer world, the second shuns them and seeks a\r\nretreat inside. The first hangs the walls of its chamber with velvet,\r\nthe second knows nothing of this luxury. Though the work is almost the\r\nsame in its results, it is at least carried out by contrary methods.\r\nThe tool, therefore, does not govern the trade. This is what the two\r\nCerambyx-beetles tell us.\r\n\r\nLet us vary the testimony of the Longicorns. I am not selecting; I am\r\nrecording it in the order of my discoveries. The Shagreen Saperda (_S.\r\ncarcharias_) lives in the black poplar; the Scalary Saperda (_S.\r\nscalaris_) lives in the cherry-tree. In both we find the same\r\norganization and the same implements, as is fitting in two\r\nclosely-related species. The Saperda of the Poplar adopts the method\r\nof the Capricorn of the Oak in its general features. It inhabits the\r\ninterior of the trunk. On the approach of the transformation, it makes\r\nan exit-gallery, the door of which is open or else masked by a remnant\r\nof bark. Then, retracing its steps, it blocks the passage with a\r\nbarricade of coarse packed shavings; and, at a depth of about eight\r\ninches, not far from the heart of the tree, it hollows out a cavity\r\nfor the nymphosis without any particular upholstering. The defensive\r\nsystem is limited to the long column of shavings. To deliver itself,\r\nthe insect will only have to push the heap of woody rubbish back, in\r\nso many lots; the path will open in front of it ready-made. If some\r\nscreen of bark hide the gallery from the outside, its mandibles will\r\neasily dispose of that: it is soft and not very thick.\r\n\r\nThe Scalary Saperda imitates the habits of its messmate, the Capricorn\r\nof the Cherry-tree. Its larva lives between the wood and the bark. To\r\nundergo its transformation, it goes down instead of coming up. In the\r\nsap-wood, parallel with the surface of the trunk, under a layer of\r\nwood barely a twenty-fifth of an inch in thickness, it makes a\r\ncylindrical cell, rounded at the ends and roughly padded with ligneous\r\nfibres. A solid plug of shavings barricades the entrance, which is not\r\npreceded by any vestibule. Here the work of deliverance is the\r\nsimplest. The Saperda has only to clear the door of his chamber to\r\nfind beneath his mandibles the little bit of bark that remains to be\r\npierced. As you see, we once more have to do with two specialists,\r\neach working in his own manner with the same tools.\r\n\r\nThe Buprestes, as zealous as the Longicorns in the destruction of\r\ntrees, whether sound or ailing, tell us the same tale as the Cerambyx-\r\nand Saperda-beetles. The Bronze Buprestis (_B. aenea_) is an inmate of\r\nthe black poplar. Her larva gnaws the interior of the trunk. For the\r\nnymphosis it installs itself near the surface in a flattened, oval\r\ncell, which is prolonged at the back by the wandering-gallery, firmly\r\npacked with wormed wood, and in front by a short, slightly curved\r\nvestibule. A layer of wood not a twenty-fifth of an inch thick is left\r\nintact at the end of the vestibule. There is no other defensive\r\nprecaution; no barricade, no heap of shavings. In order to come out,\r\nthe insect has only to pierce an insignificant sheet of wood and then\r\nthe bark.\r\n\r\nThe Nine-spotted Buprestis (_Ptosima novemmaculata_) behaves in the\r\napricot-tree precisely as the Bronze Buprestis does in the poplar. Its\r\nlarva bores the inside of the trunk with very low-ceilinged galleries,\r\nusually parallel with the axis; then, at a distance of an inch and a\r\nquarter or an inch and a half from the surface, it suddenly makes a\r\nsharp turn and proceeds in the direction of the bark. It tunnels\r\nstraight ahead, taking the shortest road, instead of advancing by\r\nirregular windings as at first. Moreover, a sensitive intuition of\r\ncoming events inspires its chisel to alter the plan of work. The\r\nperfect insect is a cylinder; the grub, wide in the thorax but slender\r\nelsewhere, is a strap, a ribbon. The first, with its unyielding\r\ncuirass, needs a cylindrical passage; the second needs a very low\r\ntunnel, with a roof that will give a purchase to the ambulatory\r\nnipples of the back. The larva therefore changes its manner of boring\r\nutterly: yesterday, the gallery, suited to a wandering life in the\r\nthickness of the wood, was a wide burrow with a very low ceiling,\r\nalmost a slot; to-day the passage is cylindrical: a gimlet could not\r\nbore it more accurately. This sudden change in the system of\r\nroad-making on behalf of the coming insect once more suggests for our\r\nmeditation the eminent degree of foresight possessed by a bit of an\r\nintestine.\r\n\r\nThe cylindrical exit-way passes through the strata of wood along the\r\nshortest line, almost normally, after a slight bend which connects the\r\nvertical with the horizontal, a curve with a radius large enough to\r\nallow the stiff Buprestis to tack about without difficulty. It ends in\r\na blind-alley, less than a twelfth of an inch from the surface of the\r\nwood. The eating away of the untouched sheet of wood and of the bark\r\nis all the labour that the grub leaves the insect to perform. Having\r\nmade these preparations, the larva withdraws, strengthening the wooden\r\nscreen, however, with a layer of fine sawdust; it reaches the end of\r\nthe round gallery, which is prolonged by the completely choked flat\r\ngallery; and here, scorning a special chamber or any upholstery, it\r\ngoes to sleep for the nymphosis, with its head towards the exit.\r\n\r\nI find numbers of specimens of a black Buprestis (_B. octoguttata_) in\r\nthe old stumps of pine-trees left standing in the ground, hard outside\r\nbut soft within, where the wood is as pliable as tinder. In this\r\nyielding substance, which has a resinous aroma, the larvae spend their\r\nlife. For the metamorphosis they leave the unctuous regions of the\r\ncentre and penetrate the hard wood, where they hollow out oval\r\nrecesses, slightly flattened, measuring from twenty-five to thirty\r\nmillimetres[1] in length. The major axis of these cells is always\r\nvertical. They are continued by a wide exit-path, sometimes straight,\r\nsometimes slightly curved, according as the tree is to be quitted\r\nthrough the section above or through the side. The exit-channel is\r\nnearly always bored completely; the window by which the insect escapes\r\nopens directly upon the outside world. At most, in a few rare\r\ninstances, the grub leaves the Buprestis the trouble of piercing a\r\nleaf of wood so thin as to be translucent. But, if easy paths are\r\nnecessary to the insect, protective ramparts are no less needed for\r\nthe safety of the nymphosis; and the larva plugs the liberating\r\nchannel with a fine paste of masticated wood, very different from the\r\nordinary sawdust. A layer of the same paste divides the bottom of the\r\nchamber from the low-ceilinged gallery, the work of the grub's active\r\nlife. Lastly, the magnifying-glass reveals upon the walls of the cell\r\na tapestry of woody fibres, very finely divided, standing erect and\r\nclosely shorn, so as to make a sort of velvet pile. This quilted\r\nlining, of which the Cerambyx of the Oak showed us the first example,\r\nis, it seems to me, pretty often employed by the wood-eaters,\r\nBuprestes as well as Longicorns.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: .975 to 1.17 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nAfter these migrants, which travel from the centre of the tree to the\r\nsurface, we will mention some others which from the surface plunge\r\ninto the interior. A small Buprestis who ravages the cherry-trees,\r\n_Anthaxia nitidula_, passes his larval existence between the wood and\r\nthe bark. When the time comes for changing its shape, the pigmy\r\nconcerns itself, like the others, with future and present needs. To\r\nassist the perfect insect, the grub first gnaws the under side of the\r\nbark, leaving a thin screen of cuticle untouched, and then sinks in\r\nthe wood a perpendicular well, blocked with unresisting sawdust. That\r\nis on behalf of the future: the frail Buprestis will be able to leave\r\nwithout hindrance. The bottom of the well, better wrought than the\r\nrest and ceiled with the aid of an adhesive fluid which holds the fine\r\nsawdust of the stopper in place, is a thing of the present; it is the\r\nnymphosis-chamber.\r\n\r\nA second Buprestis, _Chrysobothrys chrysostigma_, likewise an\r\nexploiter of the cherry-tree, between the wood and the bark, although\r\nmore vigorous, expends less labour on its preparations. Its chamber,\r\nwith modestly varnished walls, is merely an expanded extension of the\r\nordinary gallery. The grub, disinclined for persistent labour, does\r\nnot bore the wood. It confines itself to hollowing a slanting dug-out\r\nin the bark, without touching the surface layer, through which the\r\ninsect will have to gnaw its own way.\r\n\r\nThus each species displays special methods, tricks of the trade which\r\ncannot be explained merely by reference to its tools. As these minute\r\ndetails have consequences of some importance, I do not hesitate to\r\nmultiply them: they all help to throw light upon the subject which we\r\nare investigating. Let us once more see what the Longicorns are able\r\nto tell us.\r\n\r\nAn inhabitant of old pine-stumps, _Criocephalus ferus_ makes an\r\nexit-gallery which yawns widely on the outside world, opening either\r\non the section of the stump or on the sides. The road is barricaded\r\nabout two inches down with a long plug of coarse shavings. Next comes\r\nthe nymph's cylindrical, compressed apartment, which is padded with\r\nwoody fibres. It is continued underneath by the labyrinth of the\r\nlarva, the burrow crammed full of digested wood. Note also the\r\ncomplete boring of the liberating passage, including the bark when\r\nthere is any.\r\n\r\nI find _Stromatium strepens_ in ilex-logs which have been stripped of\r\ntheir bark. There is the same method of deliverance, the same passage\r\ncurving gently towards the nearest outside point, the same barricade\r\nof shavings above the cell. Was the passage also carried through the\r\nbark? The stripped logs leave me ignorant as to this detail.\r\n\r\n_Clytus tropicus_, a sapper of the cherry-tree, _C. arietis_ and _C.\r\narvicola_, sappers of the hawthorn, have a cylindrical exit-gallery,\r\nwith a sharp turn to it. The gallery is masked on the outside by a\r\nremnant of bark or wood, hardly a millimetre thick,[2] and widens, not\r\nfar from the surface, into a nymphosis-chamber, which is divided from\r\nthe burrow by a mass of packed sawdust.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: .039 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nTo continue the subject would entail an excess of monotonous\r\nrepetition. The general law stands out very clearly from these few\r\ndata: the wood-eating grubs of the Longicorns and Buprestes prepare\r\nthe path of deliverance for the perfect insect, which will have merely\r\nin one case to pass a barricade of shavings or wormed wood, or in\r\nanother to pierce a slight thickness of wood or bark. Thanks to a\r\ncurious reversal of its usual attributes, youth is here the season of\r\nenergy, of strong tools, of stubborn work; adult age is the season of\r\nleisure, of industrial ignorance, of idle diversions, without trade or\r\nprofession. The infant has its paradise in the arms of its mother, its\r\nprovidence; here the infant, the grub, is the providence of the\r\nmother. With its patient tooth, which neither the perils of the\r\noutside world nor the difficult task of boring through hard wood are\r\nable to deter, it clears a way for her to the supreme delights of the\r\nsun. The youngster prepares an easy life for the adult.\r\n\r\nCan these armour-wearers, so sturdy in appearance, be weaklings? I\r\nplace nymphs of all the species that come to hand in glass tubes of\r\nthe same diameter as the natal cell, lined with coarse paper, which\r\nwill provide a good purchase for the boring. The obstacle to be\r\npierced varies: a cork a centimetre thick;[3] a plug of poplar, very\r\nmuch softened by decay; a circular disk of sound wood. Most of my\r\ncaptives easily pierce the cork and the soft wood; these represent to\r\nthem the barricade to be overthrown, the bark curtain to be\r\nperforated. A few, however, succumb before the front to be attacked;\r\nand all perish, after fruitless attempts, before the disk of hard\r\nwood. Thus perished the strongest of them all, the Great Capricorn, in\r\nmy artificial oak-wood cells and even in my reed-stumps closed with\r\ntheir natural partitions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: .39 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThey have not the strength, or rather the patient art; and the larva,\r\nmore highly gifted, works for them. It gnaws with indomitable\r\nperseverance, an essential to success even for the strong; it digs\r\nwith amazing foresight. It knows the future shape of the adult,\r\nwhether round or oval, and bores the exit-passage accordingly, making\r\nit cylindrical in one case and elliptical in the other. It knows that\r\nthe adult is very impatient to reach the light; and it leads her\r\nthither by the shortest way. In its wandering life in the heart of the\r\ntree, it loves low-roofed, winding tunnels, just big enough to pass\r\nthrough, or widening into stations when it strikes a vein with a\r\nbetter flavour; now, it makes a short, straight, roomy corridor,\r\nleading with a sharp bend to the outside world. It had plenty of time\r\nduring its capricious wanderings; the adult has none to spare: his\r\ndays are numbered; he must get out as quickly as he can. Hence the\r\nshortest road and as little encumbered by obstacles as is consistent\r\nwith safety. The grub knows that the too sudden junction of the\r\nhorizontal and the vertical part would stop the stiff, inflexible\r\ninsect and bends it towards the outside with a gentle curve. This\r\nelbow changing the direction occurs whenever the larva ascends from\r\nthe depths; it is very short when the nymphosis-chamber is next to the\r\nsurface, but continues for some length when the chamber is well inside\r\nthe trunk. In this case, the path traced by the grub has so regular a\r\ncurve that you feel inclined to subject the work to geometrical\r\nmeasurement.\r\n\r\nFor want of sufficient data, I should have left this elbow in the\r\nshadow of a note of interrogation, had I had at my disposal only the\r\nemergence-galleries of the Longicorns and Buprestes, which are too\r\nshort to lend themselves to trustworthy examination with the\r\ncompasses. A lucky find provided me with the factors required. This\r\nwas the trunk of a dead poplar, riddled, to a height of several yards,\r\nwith an infinite number of round holes the diameter of a pencil. The\r\nprecious pole, still standing, is uprooted with due respect, in view\r\nof my designs, and carried into my study, where it is sawn into\r\nlongitudinal sections planed smooth.\r\n\r\nThe wood, while retaining its structure, has been greatly softened by\r\nthe presence of the mycelium of a mushroom, the agaric of the poplar.\r\nThe inside is decayed. The outer layers, to a depth of over four\r\ninches, are in good condition, save for the innumerable curved\r\npassages that cut through them. In a section involving the whole\r\ndiameter of the trunk, the galleries of the late occupant produce a\r\npleasing effect, of which a sheaf of corn gives us a pretty faithful\r\nimage. Almost straight, parallel with one another and assembled in a\r\nbundle down the middle, they diverge at the top and spread into a\r\ncluster of wide curves, each of which ends in one of the holes on the\r\nsurface. It is a sheaf of passages which has not the single head of a\r\nsheaf of corn, but shoots its innumerable sprouts hither and thither,\r\nat all heights.\r\n\r\nI am enraptured by this magnificent specimen. The curves, of which I\r\nuncover a layer at every stroke of the plane, far exceed my\r\nrequirements; they are strikingly regular; they afford the compasses\r\nthe full space needed for accurate measurement.\r\n\r\nBefore calling in geometry, let us, if possible, name the creator of\r\nthese beautiful curves. The inhabitants of the poplar have\r\ndisappeared, perhaps long ago, as is proved by the mycelium of the\r\nagaric; the insect would not gnaw and bore its way through timber all\r\npermeated with the felt-like growth of the cryptogam. A few weaklings,\r\nhowever, have died without being able to escape. I find their remains\r\nswathed in mycelium. The agaric has preserved them from destruction by\r\nwrapping them in tight cerements. Under these mummy-bandages, I\r\nrecognise a Saw-fly, _Sirex augur_, KLUG., in the state of the perfect\r\ninsect. And--this is an important detail--all these adult remains,\r\nwithout a single exception, occupy spots which have no means of\r\ncommunication with the outside. I find them sometimes in a\r\npartly-constructed curved passage, beyond which the wood remains\r\nintact, sometimes at the end of the straight central gallery, choked\r\nwith sawdust, which is not continued in front. These remains, with no\r\nthoroughfare before them, tell us plainly that the Sirex adopts for\r\nits exit methods not employed by the Buprestes and the Longicorns.\r\n\r\nThe larva does not prepare the path of deliverance; it is left for the\r\nperfect insect to open itself a passage through the wood. What I have\r\nbefore my eyes tells me more or less plainly the sequence of events.\r\nThe larva, whose presence is proved by galleries blocked with packed\r\nsawdust, do not leave the centre of the trunk, a quieter retreat, less\r\nsubject to the vicissitudes of the climate. Metamorphosis is effected\r\nat the junction of the straight gallery and the curved passage which\r\nis not yet made. When strength comes, the perfect insect tunnels ahead\r\nfor a distance of more than four inches and opens up the exit-passage,\r\nwhich I find choked, not with compact sawdust, but with loose powdery\r\nrubbish. The dead insects which I strip of their mycelium-shrouds are\r\nweaklings whose strength deserted them mid-way. The rest of the\r\npassage is lacking because the labourer died on the road.\r\n\r\nWith this fact of the insect itself boring the exit passage, the\r\nproblem assumes a more troublesome form. If the larva, rich in leisure\r\nand satisfied with its sojourn in the interior of the trunk,\r\nsimplifies the coming emergence by shortening the road, what must not\r\nthe adult do, who has so short a time to live and who is in so great a\r\nhurry to leave the hateful darkness? He above any other should be a\r\njudge of short cuts. To go from the murky heart of the tree to the\r\nsun-steeped bark, why does he not follow a straight line? It is the\r\nshortest way.\r\n\r\nYes, for the compasses, but not perhaps for the sapper. The length\r\ntraversed is not the only factor of the work accomplished, of the\r\ntotal activity expended. We must take into account the resistance\r\novercome, a resistance which varies according to the depth of the more\r\nor less hard strata and according to the method of attacking the woody\r\nfibres, which are either broken across or divided lengthwise. Under\r\nthese conditions, whose value remains to be determined, can there be a\r\ncurve involving a minimum of mechanical labour in cutting through the\r\nwood?\r\n\r\nI was already trying to discover how the resistance may vary according\r\nto depth and direction; I was working out my differentials and my\r\nminimum integrals, when a very simple idea overturned my slippery\r\nscaffolding. The calculation of variations has nothing to do with the\r\nmatter. The animal is not the moving body of the mathematicians, the\r\nparticle of matter guided in its trajectory solely by the motive\r\nforces and the resistance of the medium traversed; it bears within\r\nitself conditions which control the others. The adult insect does not\r\neven enjoy the larva's privileges; it cannot bend freely in all\r\ndirections. Under its harness it is almost a stiff cylinder. To\r\nsimplify the explanation, we may liken the insect to a section of an\r\ninflexible straight line.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the Sirex, reduced by abstraction to its axis. The\r\nmetamorphosis is effected not far from the centre of the trunk. The\r\ninsect lies lengthwise in the tree with its head up, very rarely with\r\nits head down. It must reach the outside as quickly as possible. The\r\nsection of an inflexible straight line that represents it nibbles away\r\na little wood in front of it and obtains a shallow cavity wide enough\r\nto allow of a very slight turn towards the outside. An infinitesimal\r\nadvance is made; a second follows, the result of a similar cavity and\r\na similar turn in the same direction. In short, each change of\r\nposition is accompanied by the tiny deviation permitted by the slight\r\nexcess of width of the hole; and this deviation invariably points the\r\nsame way. Imagine a magnetic needle swung out of its position and\r\ntending to return to it while moving with a uniform speed through a\r\nresisting medium in which a sheath of a diameter slightly greater than\r\nthe needle's opens bit by bit. The Sirex behaves more or less in the\r\nsame fashion. His magnetic pole is the light outside. He makes for\r\nthat direction by imperceptible deviations as his tooth digs.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the Sirex is now solved. The trajectory is composed of\r\nequal elements, with an invariable angle between them; it is the curve\r\nwhose tangents, divided by infinitely small distances, retain the same\r\ninclination between each one and the next; the curve, in a word, with\r\na constant angle of contingence. This characteristic betrays the\r\ncircumference of the circle.\r\n\r\nIt remains to discover whether the facts confirm the logical argument.\r\nI take accurate tracings of a score of galleries, selecting those\r\nwhose length best lends itself to the test of the compasses. Well,\r\nlogic agrees with reality: over lengths which sometimes exceed four\r\ninches, the track of the compasses is identical with that of the\r\ninsect. The most pronounced deviations do not exceed the small\r\nvariations which we must reasonably expect in a problem of a physical\r\nnature, a problem incompatible with the absolute accuracy of abstract\r\ntruths.\r\n\r\nThe Sirex' exit-gallery then is a wide arc of a circle whose lower\r\nextremity is connected with the corridor of the larva and whose upper\r\nextremity is prolonged in a straight line which ends at the surface\r\nwith a perpendicular or slightly oblique incidence. The wide\r\nconnecting arc enables the insect to tack about. When, starting from a\r\nposition parallel with the axis of the tree, the Sirex has passed\r\ngradually to a transversal position, he completes his course in a\r\nstraight line, which is the shortest road.\r\n\r\nDoes the trajectory imply the minimum of work? Yes, under the\r\nconditions of the insect's existence. If the larva had taken the\r\nprecaution to place itself in a different direction when preparing for\r\nthe nymphosis, to turn its head towards the nearest point of the bark\r\ninstead of turning it lengthwise with the trunk, obviously the adult\r\nwould escape more easily: he would merely have to gnaw straight in\r\nfront of him in order to pass through the minimum thickness. But\r\nreasons of convenience whereof the grub is the sole judge, reasons\r\ndictated perhaps by weight, cause the vertical to precede the\r\nhorizontal position. In order to pass from the former to the latter,\r\nthe insect veers round by describing the arc of a circle. When this\r\nturn has been effected, the distance is completed in a straight line.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the Sirex at his starting-point. His stiffness of\r\nnecessity compels him to turn gradually. Here the insect can do\r\nnothing of its own initiative; everything is mechanically determined.\r\nBut, being free to pivot on its axis and to attack the wood on either\r\nside of the sheath, it has the option of attempting this reversal in a\r\nhost of different ways, by a series of connected arcs, not in the same\r\nplane. Nothing prevents it from describing winding curves by revolving\r\nupon itself: spirals, loops constantly changing their direction, in\r\nfact, the complicated route of a creature that has lost its way. It\r\nmight wander in a tortuous maze, making fresh attempts here, there and\r\neverywhere, groping for ever so long without succeeding.\r\n\r\nBut it does not grope and it succeeds very well. Its gallery is still\r\ncontained within one plane, the first condition of the minimum of\r\nlabour. Moreover, of the different vertical planes that can pass\r\nthrough the eccentric starting-point, one, the plane which passes\r\nthrough the axis of the tree, corresponds on the one side with the\r\nminimum of resistance to be overcome and on the other with the\r\nmaximum. Nothing prevents the Sirex from tracing his path in any one\r\nof the multitude of planes on which the path would possess an\r\nintermediate value between the shortest and the longest. The insect\r\nrefuses them all and constantly adopts the one which passes through\r\nthe axis, choosing, of course, the side that entails the shortest\r\npath. In brief, the Sirex' gallery is contained in a plane pointing\r\ntowards the axis of the tree and the starting-point; and of the two\r\nportions of this plane the channel passes through the less extensive.\r\nUnder the conditions, therefore, imposed upon him by his stiffness the\r\nhermit of the poplar-tree releases himself with the minimum of\r\nmechanical labour.\r\n\r\nThe miner guides himself by the compass in the unknown depths\r\nunderground, the sailor does the same in the unknown ocean solitudes.\r\nHow does the wood-eating insect guide itself in the thickness of a\r\ntree-trunk? Has it a compass? One would almost say that it had, so\r\nsuccessfully does it keep to the quickest road. Its goal is the light.\r\nTo reach this goal, it suddenly chooses the economical plane\r\ntrajectory, after spending its larval leisure in roaming tortuous\r\npassages full of irregular curves; it bends it in an arc which allows\r\nit to turn about; and, with its head held plumb with the adjacent\r\nsurface, it goes straight ahead by the nearest way.\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary obstacles are powerless to turn it aside from\r\nits plane and its curve, so imperative is its guiding force. It will\r\ngnaw metal, if need be, rather than turn its back upon the light,\r\nwhich it feels to be close at hand. The entomological records place\r\nthis incredible fact beyond a doubt. At the time of the Crimean War,\r\nthe Institut de France received some packets of cartridges in which\r\nthe bullets had been perforated by _Sirex juvencus_; a little later,\r\nat the Grenoble Arsenal, _S. gigas_ carved himself a similar exit. The\r\nlarva was in the wood of the cartridge-boxes; and the adult insect,\r\nfaithful to its direction of escape, had bored through the lead\r\nbecause the nearest daylight was behind that obstacle.\r\n\r\nThere is an exit-compass, that is incontestable, both for the larvae\r\npreparing the passage of deliverance and for the adult insect, the\r\nSirex obliged to make that passage for himself. What is it? Here the\r\nproblem becomes surrounded with a darkness which is perhaps\r\nimpenetrable; we are not well enough equipped with means of receiving\r\nimpressions even to imagine the causes which guide the creature. There\r\nis, in certain events, another world of the senses in which our organs\r\nperceive nothing, a world which is closed to us. The eye of the camera\r\nsees the invisible and photographs the image of the ultra-violet rays;\r\nthe tympanum of the microphone hears what to us is silence. A\r\nscientific toy, a chemical contrivance surpass us in sensibility.\r\nWould it be rash to attribute similar faculties to the delicate\r\norganization of the insect, even with regard to agencies unknown to\r\nour science, because they do not fall within the domain of our senses?\r\nTo this question there is no positive reply; we have suspicions and\r\nnothing more. Let us at least dispel a few false notions that might\r\noccur to us.\r\n\r\nDoes the wood guide the insect, adult or larva, by its structure?\r\nGnawed across the grain, it must produce a certain impression; gnawed\r\nlengthwise, it must produce a different impression. Is there not\r\nsomething here to guide the sapper? No, for in the stump of a tree\r\nleft standing the emergence takes place, according to the proximity of\r\nthe light, sometimes by way of the horizontal section, by means of a\r\nrectilinear path running along the grain, and sometimes by way of the\r\nside, by means of a curved road cutting across the grain.\r\n\r\nIs the compass a chemical influence, or electrical, or calorific, or\r\nwhat not? No, for in an upright trunk the emergence is effected as\r\noften by the north face, which is always in the shade, as by the south\r\nface, which receives the sun all day long. The exit-door opens in the\r\nside which is nearest, without any other condition. Can it be the\r\ntemperature? Not that either, for the shady side, though cooler, is\r\nutilized as often as the side facing the sun.\r\n\r\nCan it be sound? Not so. The sound of what, in the silence of\r\nsolitude? And are the noises of the outside world propagated through\r\nhalf an inch of wood in such a way as to make differences perceptible?\r\nCan it be weight? No again, for the trunk of the poplar shows us more\r\nthan one Sirex travelling upside down, with his head towards the\r\nground, without any change in the direction of the curved passages.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the guide? I have no idea. It is not the first time that\r\nthis obscure question has been put to me. When studying the emergence\r\nof the Three-pronged Osmia from the bramble-stems shifted from their\r\nnatural position by my wiles, I recognized the uncertainty in which\r\nthe evidence of physical science leaves us; and, in the impossibility\r\nof finding any other reply, I suggested a special sense, the sense of\r\nopen space. Instructed by the Sirex, the Buprestes, the Longicorns, I\r\nam once again compelled to make the same suggestion. It is not that I\r\ncare for the expression: the unknown cannot be named in any language.\r\nIt means that the hermits in the dark know how to find the light by\r\nthe shortest road; it is the confessions of an ignorance which no\r\nhonest observer will blush to share. Now that the evolutionists'\r\ninterpretations of instinct have been recognized as worthless, we all\r\ncome to that stimulating maxim of Anaxagoras', which laconically sums\r\nup the result of my researches:\r\n\r\n\"[Greek: Nous panta diekosmese]. Mind orders all things.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nTHE DUNG-BEETLES OF THE PAMPAS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo travel the world, by land and sea, from pole to pole; to\r\ncross-question life, under every clime, in the infinite variety of its\r\nmanifestations: that surely would be glorious luck for him that has\r\neyes to see; and it formed the radiant dream of my young years, at the\r\ntime when _Robinson Crusoe_ was my delight. These rosy illusions, rich\r\nin voyages, were soon succeeded by dull, stay-at-home reality. The\r\njungles of India, the virgin forests of Brazil, the towering crests of\r\nthe Andes, beloved by the Condor, were reduced, as a field for\r\nexploration, to a patch of pebbles enclosed within four walls.\r\n\r\nHeaven forfend that I should complain! The gathering of ideas does not\r\nnecessarily imply distant expeditions. Jean-Jacques Rousseau[1]\r\nherborized with the bunch of chick-weed whereon he fed his Canary;\r\nBernardin de Saint-Pierre[2] discovered a world on a strawberry-plant\r\nthat grew by accident in a corner of his window; Xavier de Maistre,[3]\r\nusing an arm-chair by way of post-chaise, made one of the most famous\r\nof journeys around his room.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), author of the\r\n_Confessions_, _La Nouvelle Heloise_, etc.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Jacques Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (1737-1814),\r\nauthor of _Paul et Virginie_, _La Chaumiere idienne_ and _Etudes de la\r\nnature_.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Xavier de Maistre (1763-1852), best known for his _Voyage\r\nautour de ma chambre_ (1795).--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThis manner of seeing country is within my means, always excepting the\r\npost-chaise, which is too difficult to drive through the bushes. I go\r\nthe circuit of my enclosure over and over again, a hundred times, by\r\nshort stages; I stop here and I stop there; patiently, I put questions\r\nand, at long intervals, I receive some scrap of a reply.\r\n\r\nThe smallest insect village has become familiar to me: I know each\r\nfruit-branch where the Praying Mantis[4] perches; each bush where the\r\npale Italian Cricket[5] strums amid the calmness of the summer nights;\r\neach downy plant scraped by the Anthidium, that maker of cotton bags;\r\neach cluster of lilac worked by the Megachile, the Leaf-cutter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Cf. _The Life of the Grasshopper_: chaps. vi. to\r\nix.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Cf. _idem_: chap. xvi.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nIf cruising among the nooks and corners of the garden do not suffice,\r\na longer voyage shows ample profit. I double the cape of the\r\nneighbouring hedges and, at a few hundred yards, enter into relations\r\nwith the Sacred Beetle,[6] the Capricorn, the Geotrupes,[7] the\r\nCopris,[8] the Decticus,[9] the Cricket,[10] the Green\r\nGrasshopper,[11] in short, with a host of tribes the telling of whose\r\nstory would exhaust a lifetime. Certainly, I have enough and even too\r\nmuch to do with my near neighbours, without leaving home to rove in\r\ndistant lands.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Cf. _The Sacred Beetle and Others_, by J. Henri Fabre,\r\ntranslated by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos: chaps i. to\r\nvi.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Cf. _idem_: chaps. xii. to xiv.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Cf. _idem_: chaps. ix. and xvi.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Cf. _The Life of the Grasshopper_: chaps. xi. to\r\nxiii.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Cf. _idem_: chaps. xv. and xvi.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Cf. _idem_: chap. xiv.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nBesides, roaming the world, scattering one's attention over a host of\r\nsubjects, is not observing. The travelling entomologist can stick\r\nnumerous species, the joy of the collector and the nomenclator, into\r\nhis boxes; but to gather circumstantial evidence is a very different\r\nmatter. A Wandering Jew of science, he has no time to stop. Where a\r\nprolonged stay would be necessary to study this or that fact, he is\r\nhurried past the next stage. We must not expect the impossible of him\r\nunder these conditions. Let him pin his specimens to cork tablets, let\r\nhim steep them in jars of spirit, and leave to the sedentary the\r\npatient observations that require time.\r\n\r\nThis explains the extreme penury of history outside the dry\r\ndescriptions of the nomenclator. Overwhelming us with its numbers, the\r\nexotic insect nearly always preserves the secret of its manners.\r\nNevertheless, it were well to compare what happens under our eyes with\r\nthat which happens elsewhere; it were excellent to see how, in the\r\nsame guild of workers, the fundamental instinct varies with climatic\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThen my longing to travel returns, vainer to-day than ever, unless one\r\ncould find a seat on that carpet of which we read in the _Arabian\r\nNights_, the famous carpet whereon one had but to sit to be carried\r\nwhithersoever he pleased. O marvellous conveyance, far preferable to\r\nXavier de Maistre's post-chaise! If I could only find just a little\r\ncorner on it, with a return-ticket!\r\n\r\nI do find it. I owe this unexpected good fortune to a Brother of the\r\nChristian Schools, to Brother Judulien, of the La Salle College at\r\nBuenos Aires. His modesty would be offended by the praises which his\r\ndebtor owes him. Let us simply say that, acting on my instructions,\r\nhis eyes take the place of mine. He seeks, finds, observes, sends me\r\nhis notes and his discoveries. I observe, seek and find with him, by\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nIt is done; thanks to this first-rate collaborator, I have my seat on\r\nthe magic carpet. Behold me in the pampas of the Argentine Republic,\r\neager to draw a parallel between the industry of the Serignan[12]\r\nDung-beetles and that of their rivals in the western hemisphere.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Serignan, in Provence, where the author ended his\r\ndays.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nA glorious beginning! An accidental find procures me, to begin with,\r\nthe Splendid Phanaeus (_P. splendidulus_), who combines a coppery\r\neffulgence with the sparkling green of the emerald. One is quite\r\nastonished to see so rich a gem load its basket with ordure. It is the\r\njewel on the dung-hill. The corselet of the male is grooved with a\r\nwide hollow and he sports a pair of sharp-edged pinions on his\r\nshoulders; on his forehead he plants a horn which vies with that of\r\nthe Spanish Copris. While equally rich in metallic splendour, his mate\r\nhas no fantastic embellishments, which are an exclusive prerogative of\r\nmasculine dandyism among the Dung-beetles of La Plata as among our\r\nown.\r\n\r\nNow what can the gorgeous foreigner do? Precisely what the Lunary\r\nCopris[13] does with us. Settling, like the other, under a flat cake\r\nof Cow-dung, the South American Beetle kneads egg-shaped loaves\r\nunderground. Not a thing is forgotten: the round belly with the\r\nlargest volume and the smallest surface; the hard rind which acts as a\r\npreservative against premature desiccation; the terminal nipple where\r\nthe egg is lodged in a hatching-chamber; and, at the end of the\r\nnipple, the felt stopper which admits the air needed by the germ.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 13: Cf. _The Sacred Beetle and Others_: chap.\r\nxvi.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nAll these things I have seen here and I see over there, almost at the\r\nother end of the world. Life, ruled by inflexible logic, repeats\r\nitself in its works, for what is true in one latitude cannot be false\r\nin another. We go very far afield in search of a new spectacle to\r\nmeditate upon; and we have an inexhaustible specimen before our eyes,\r\nbetween the walls of our enclosure.\r\n\r\nSettled under the sumptuous dish dropped by the Ox, the Phanaeus, one\r\nwould think, ought to make the very best use of it and to stock her\r\nburrow with a number of ovoids, after the example of the Lunary\r\nCopris. She does nothing of the sort, preferring to roam from one find\r\nto the other and to take from each the wherewithal to model a single\r\npellet, which is left to itself for the soil to incubate. She is not\r\ndriven to practise economy even when she is working the produce of the\r\nSheep far from the pastures of the Argentine.\r\n\r\nCan this be because the jewel of the pampas dispenses with the\r\nfather's collaboration? I dare not follow up the argument, for the\r\nSpanish Copris would give me the lie, by showing me the mother\r\noccupied alone in settling the family and nevertheless stocking her\r\none pit with a number of pellets. Each has her share of customs the\r\nsecret of which escapes us.\r\n\r\nThe two next, _Megathopa bicolor_ and _M. intermedia_, have certain\r\npoints of resemblance with the Sacred Beetle, for whose ebon hue they\r\nsubstitute a blue black. The first besides brightens his corselet with\r\nmagnificent copper reflections. With their long legs, their forehead\r\nwith its radiating denticulations and their flattened wing-cases, they\r\nare fairly successful smaller editions of the famous pill-roller.\r\n\r\nThey also share her talent. The work of both is once again a sort of\r\npear, but constructed in a more ingenious fashion, with an almost\r\nconical neck and without any elegant curves. From the point of view of\r\nbeauty, it falls short of the Sacred Beetle's work. Considering the\r\ntools, which have ample free play and are well adapted for clasping, I\r\nexpected something better from the two modellers. No matter: the work\r\nof the Megathopae conforms with the fundamental art of the other\r\npill-rollers.\r\n\r\nA fourth, _Bolbites onitoides_, compensates us for repetitions which,\r\nit is true, widen the scope of the problem but teach us nothing new.\r\nShe is a handsome Beetle with a metallic costume, green or copper-red\r\naccording as the light happens to fall. Her four-cornered shape and\r\nher long, toothed fore-legs make her resemble our Onites.[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Cf. _The Sacred Beetle and Others_: chap.\r\nxvi.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nIn her, the Dung-beetles' guild reveals itself under a very unexpected\r\naspect. We know insects that knead soft loaves; and here are some\r\nwhich, to keep their bread fresh, discover ceramics and become\r\npotters, working clay in which they pack the food of the larvae.\r\nBefore my housekeeper, before any of us, they knew how, with the aid\r\nof a round jar, to keep the provisions from drying during the summer\r\nheats. The work of the Bolbites is an ovoid, hardly differing in shape\r\nfrom that of the Copres; but this is where the ingenuity of the\r\nAmerican insect shines forth. The inner mass, the usual dung-cake\r\nfurnished by the Cow or the Sheep, is covered with a perfectly\r\nhomogeneous and continuous coating of clay, which makes a piece of\r\nsolid pottery impervious to evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe earthen pot is exactly filled by its contents, without the\r\nslightest interval along the line of junction. This detail tells us\r\nthe worker's method. The jar is moulded on the provisions. After the\r\nfood-pellet has been formed in the ordinary baker's fashion and the\r\negg laid in its hatching-chamber, the Bolbites takes some armfuls of\r\nthe clay near at hand, applies it to the foodstuff and presses it\r\ndown. When the work is finished and smoothed to perfection with\r\nindefatigable patience, the tiny pot, built up piecemeal, looks as\r\nthough made with the wheel and rivals our own earthenware in\r\nregularity.\r\n\r\nThe hatching-chamber, in which the egg lies, is, as usual, contrived\r\nin the nipple at the end of the pear. How will the germ and the young\r\nlarva manage to breathe under that clay casing, which intercepts the\r\naccess of the air?\r\n\r\nHave no fears: the pot-maker knows quite well how matters stand. She\r\ntakes good care not to close the top with the plastic earth which\r\nsupplied her with the walls. At some distance from the tip of the\r\nnipple, the clay ceases to play its part and makes way for fibrous\r\nparticles, for tiny scraps of undigested fodder, which, arranged one\r\nabove the other with a certain order, form a sort of thatched roof\r\nover the egg. The inward and outward passage of the air is assured\r\nthrough this coarse screen.\r\n\r\nOne is set thinking in the presence of this layer of clay, which\r\nprotects the fresh provisions, and this vent-hole stopped with a truss\r\nof straw, which admits the air freely, while defending the entrance.\r\nThere is the eternal question, if we do not rise above the\r\ncommonplace: how did the insect acquire so wise an art?\r\n\r\nNot one fails in obeying those two laws, the safety of the egg and\r\nready ventilation; not one, not even the next on my list, whose talent\r\nopens up a new horizon: I am now speaking of Lacordaire's Gromphas.\r\nLet not this repellant name of Gromphas (the old sow) give us a wrong\r\nnotion of the insect. On the contrary, it is, like the last, an\r\nelegant Dung-beetle, dark-bronze, thickset, square-shaped like our\r\nBison Onitis[15] and almost as large. It also practises the same\r\nindustry, at least as regards the general effect of the work.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Cf. _The Sacred Beetle and Others_: chap.\r\nxvi.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nIts burrow branches into a small number of cylindrical cells, forming\r\nthe homes of as many larvae. For each of these the provisions consist\r\nof a parcel of Cow-dung, about an inch deep. The material is carefully\r\npacked and fills the bottom of the cavity, just as a soft paste would\r\ndo when pressed down in a mould. Until now the work is similar to that\r\nof the Bison Onitis; but the resemblance goes no farther and is\r\nreplaced by profound and curious differences, having no connection\r\nwith what the Dung-beetles of our own parts show us.\r\n\r\nAs we know, our sausage-makers, Onites and Geotrupes alike, place the\r\negg at the lower end of their cylinder, in a cell contrived in the\r\nvery midst of the mass of foodstuffs. Their rival in the pampas adopts\r\na diametrically opposite method: she places the egg above the\r\nvictuals, at the upper end of the sausage. In order to feed, the grub\r\ndoes not have to work upwards; on the contrary, it works downwards.\r\n\r\nMore remarkable still: the egg does not lie immediately on top of the\r\nprovisions; it is installed in a clay chamber with a wall about\r\none-twelfth of an inch in thickness. This wall forms an\r\nhermetically-sealed lid, curves into a cup and then rises and bends\r\nover to make a vaulted ceiling.\r\n\r\nThe germ is thus enclosed in a mineral box, having no connection with\r\nthe provision-store, which is kept strictly shut. The newborn grub\r\nmust employ the first efforts of its teeth to break the seals, to cut\r\nthrough the clay floor and to make a trap-door which will take it to\r\nthe underlying cake.\r\n\r\nA rough beginning for the feeble mandible, even though the material to\r\nbe bored through is a fine clay. Other grubs bite at once into a soft\r\nbread which surrounds them on every side; this one, on leaving the\r\negg, has to make a breach in a wall before taking nourishment.\r\n\r\nOf what use are these obstacles? I do not doubt that they have their\r\npurpose. If the grub is born at the bottom of a closed pot, if it has\r\nto chew through brick to reach the larder, I feel sure that certain\r\nconditions of its well-being demand this. But what conditions? To\r\nbecome acquainted with them would call for an examination on the spot;\r\nand all the data that I possess are a few nests, lifeless things very\r\ndifficult to interrogate. However, it is possible to catch a glimpse\r\nof one or two points.\r\n\r\nThe Gromphas' burrow is shallow; those little cylinders, her loaves,\r\nare greatly exposed to drought. Over there, as here, the drying up of\r\nthe victuals constitutes a mortal danger. To avert this peril, by far\r\nthe most sensible course is to enclose the food in absolutely shut\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nWell, the receptacle is dug in very fine, homogeneous, water-tight\r\nearth, with not a bit of gravel, not an atom of sand in it. Together\r\nwith the lid that forms the bottom of its round chamber, in which the\r\negg is lodged, this cavity becomes an urn whose contents are safe from\r\ndrought for a long time, even under a scorching sun. However late the\r\nhatching, the new-born grub, on finding the lid, will have under its\r\nteeth provisions as fresh as though they dated from that very day.\r\n\r\nThe clay food-pit, with its closely-fitting lid, is an excellent\r\nmethod, than which our agricultural experts have discovered no better\r\nway of preserving fodder; but it possesses one drawback: to reach the\r\nstack of food, the grub has first to open a passage through the floor\r\nof its chamber. Instead of the pap called for by its weakly stomach,\r\nit begins by finding a brick to chew.\r\n\r\nThe rude task would be avoided if the egg lay directly on top of the\r\nvictuals, inside the case itself. Here our logic is at fault: it\r\nforgets an essential point, which the insect is careful not to\r\ndisregard. The germ breathes. Its development requires air; and the\r\nperfectly-closed clay urn does not allow any air to enter. The grub\r\nhas to be born outside the pot.\r\n\r\nAgreed. But, in the matter of breathing, the egg is no better off for\r\nbeing shut up, on top of the provisions, in a clay casket quite as\r\nair-tight as the jar itself. Examine the thing more closely, however,\r\nand you will receive a satisfactory reply. The walls of the\r\nhatching-chamber are carefully glazed inside. The mother has taken\r\nmeticulous pains to give them a stucco-like finish. The vaulted\r\nceiling alone is rugged, because the building-tool now works from the\r\noutside and is unable to reach the inner surface of the lid and smooth\r\nit. Moreover, in the centre of this curved and embossed ceiling, a\r\nsmall opening has been made. This is the air-hole, which allows of\r\ngaseous exchanges between the atmosphere inside the box and that\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nIf it were entirely free, this opening would be dangerous: some\r\nplunderer might take advantage of it to enter the casket. The mother\r\nforesees the risk. She blocks the breathing-hole with a plug made of\r\nthe ravelled vegetable fibres of the Cow-dung, a stopper which is\r\neminently permeable. It is an exact repetition of that which the\r\nvarious modellers have shown us at the top of their calabashes and\r\npears. All of them are acquainted with the nice secret of the felt\r\nstopper as a means of ventilating the egg in a water-tight enclosure.\r\n\r\nYour name is not an attractive one, my pretty Dung-beetle of the\r\npampas, but your industrial methods are most remarkable. I know some\r\namong your fellow-countrymen, however, who surpass you in ingenuity.\r\nOne of these is _Phanaeus Milon_, a magnificent insect, blue-black all\r\nover.\r\n\r\nThe male's corselet juts forward. On the head is a short, broad,\r\nflattened horn, ending in a trident. The female replaces this ornament\r\nby simple folds. Both carry on the forehead two spikes which form a\r\ntrusty digging-implement and also a scalpel for dissecting. The\r\ninsect's squat, sturdy, four-cornered build resembles that of _Onitis\r\nOlivieri_, one of the rarities of the neighbourhood of Montpellier.\r\n\r\nIf similarity of shape implied purity of work, we ought unhesitatingly\r\nto attribute to _Phanaeus Milon_ short, thick puddings like those made\r\nby Olivier's Onitis.[16] Alas, structure is a bad guide where instinct\r\nis concerned! The square-chined, short-legged Dung-beetle excels in\r\nthe art of manufacturing gourds. The Sacred Beetle herself supplies\r\nnone that are more correctly shaped nor, above all, more capacious.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: I owe this detail on the work of Olivier's Onitis to a\r\nnote and a sketch communicated by Professor Valery-Mayer, of the\r\nMontpellier School of Agriculture.--_Author's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThe thickset insect astonishes me with the elegance of its work, which\r\nis irreproachable in its geometry: the neck is shorter, but\r\nnevertheless combines grace with strength. The model seems derived\r\nfrom some Indian calabash, the more so as it has an open mouth and the\r\nbelly is engraved with an elegant engine-turned pattern, produced by\r\nthe insect's tarsi. One seems to see a pitcher protected by a\r\nwickerwork covering. The whole attains and even exceeds the size of a\r\nHen's egg.\r\n\r\nIt is a very curious piece of work and of a rare perfection,\r\nespecially when we consider the artist's clumsy and massive build. No,\r\nonce again, the tool does not make the workman, among Dung-beetles any\r\nmore than among ourselves. To guide the modeller there is something\r\nbetter than a set of tools: there is what I have called the bump, the\r\ngenius of the animal.\r\n\r\n_Phanaeus Milon_ scoffs at difficulties. He does much more than that:\r\nhe laughs at our classifications. The word Dung-beetle implies a lover\r\nof dung. He sets no value on it, either for his own use or for that of\r\nhis offspring. What he wants is the sanies of corpses. He is to be\r\nfound under the carcasses of birds, Dogs or Cats, in the company of\r\nthe undertakers-in-ordinary. The gourd which I will presently describe\r\nwas lying in the earth under the remains of an Owl.\r\n\r\nLet him who will explain this conjunction of the appetites of the\r\nNecrophorus[17] with the talents of the Sacred Beetle. As for me,\r\nbaffled by tastes which no one would suspect from the mere appearance\r\nof the insect, I give it up.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Or Burying-beetle. Cf. Chapters XI. and XII. of the\r\npresent volume.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nI know in my neighbourhood one Dung-beetle and one alone who also\r\nworks among carrion. This is _Onthophagus ovatus_, LIN., a constant\r\nfrequenter of dead Moles and Rabbits. But the dwarf undertaker does\r\nnot on that account scorn stercoraceous fare: he feasts upon it like\r\nthe other Onthophagi. Perhaps there is a twofold diet here: the bun\r\nfor the adult; the highly-spiced, far-gone meat for the grub.\r\n\r\nSimilar facts are encountered elsewhere, with differing tastes. The\r\nHunting Wasp takes her fill of honey drawn from the nectaries of the\r\nflowers, but feeds her little ones on game. Game first and then sugar,\r\nfor the same stomach! How that digestive pouch must change during\r\ndevelopment! And yet no more than our own, which scorns in later life\r\nthe food that delighted it when young.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the work of _Phanaeus Milon_ more thoroughly. The\r\ncalabashes reached me in a state of complete desiccation. They are\r\nvery nearly as hard as stone; their colour inclines to a pale\r\nchocolate. Neither inside nor out does the lens discover the slightest\r\nligneous particle pointing to a vegetable residue. The strange\r\nDung-beetle does not, therefore, use cakes of Cow-dung or anything\r\nlike them; he handles products of another class, which at first are\r\nrather difficult to specify.\r\n\r\nHeld to the ear and shaken, the object rattles slightly, as would the\r\nshell of a dry fruit with a stone lying free inside it. Does it\r\ncontain the grub, shrivelled by desiccation? Does it contain the dead\r\ninsect? I thought so, but I was wrong. It contains something much more\r\ninstructive than that.\r\n\r\nI carefully rip up the gourd with the point of a knife. Within a\r\nhomogenous wall, whose thickness is over three-quarters of an inch in\r\nthe largest of my three specimens, is encased a spherical kernel,\r\nwhich fills the cavity exactly, but without sticking to the wall at\r\nany part. The small amount of free play allowed to this kernel\r\naccounts for the rattling which I heard when I shook the thing.\r\n\r\nIn the colour and general appearance of the whole, the kernel does not\r\ndiffer from the wrapper. But break it open and minutely examine the\r\npieces. We now recognize tiny fragments of bone, flocks of down,\r\nthreads of wool, scraps of flesh, the whole mixed in an earthy paste\r\nresembling chocolate.\r\n\r\nThis paste, when placed on hot charcoal, sifted under the lens and\r\ndeprived of its particles of dead bodies, becomes much darker, is\r\ncovered with shiny bubbles and sends forth puffs of that acrid smoke\r\nby which we so readily recognize burnt animal matter. The whole mass\r\nof the kernel, therefore, is strongly impregnated with sanies.\r\n\r\nTreated in the same manner, the wrapper also turns black, but not to\r\nthe same extent; it hardly smokes; it does not become covered with\r\njet-black bubbles; lastly, it would not anywhere contain bits of\r\ncarcase similar to those in the central kernel. In both cases, the\r\nresidue after calcination is a fine, reddish clay.\r\n\r\nThis brief analysis tells us all about the table of _Phanaeus Milon_.\r\nThe fare served to the grub is a sort of meat-pie. The sausage-meat\r\nconsists of a mince of all that the two scalpels of the forehead and\r\nthe toothed knives of the fore-legs have been able to remove from the\r\ncorpse: hair and down, small crushed bones, strips of flesh and skin.\r\nNow hard as brick, the thickening of this mincemeat was originally a\r\npaste of fine clay steeped in the liquor of corruption. Lastly, the\r\nlight crust of our meat-pies is here represented by a covering of the\r\nsame clay, less rich in extract of meat than the other.\r\n\r\nThe pastry-cook gives his work an elegant shape; he decorates it with\r\nrosettes, with twists, with scrolls. _Phanaeus Milon_ is no stranger\r\nto these culinary aesthetics. She turns the crust of her meat-pie into\r\na splendid gourd, with a finger-print ornamentation.\r\n\r\nThe outer covering, an unprofitable crust, insufficiently steeped in\r\nsavoury juices, is not, we can easily guess, intended for consumption.\r\nIt is possible that, somewhat later, when the stomach becomes robust\r\nand is not repelled by coarse fare, the grub scrapes a little from the\r\nsides of its pasty walls; but, until the adult insect emerges, the\r\ncalabash as a whole remains intact, having acted at first as a\r\nsafeguard of the freshness of the force-meat and all the while as a\r\nprotecting casket for the recluse.\r\n\r\nAbove the cold pastry, right at the base of the neck of the gourd, is\r\ncontrived a round cell with a clay wall continuing the general wall. A\r\nfairly thick floor, made of the same material, separates it from the\r\nstore-room. This is the hatching-chamber. Here is laid the egg, which\r\nI find in its place but dried up; here is hatched the grub, which, to\r\nreach the ball of food, must first open a trap-door through the\r\npartition that separates the two stories.\r\n\r\nWe have here, in short, the edifice of the Gromphas, in a different\r\nstyle of architecture. The grub is born in a casket surmounting the\r\nstack of food but not communicating with it. The budding larva must\r\ntherefore, at the opportune moment, itself pierce the covering of the\r\npot of preserves. As a matter of fact, later, when the grub is on the\r\nsausage-meat, we find the floor perforated with a hole just large\r\nenough for it to pass through.\r\n\r\nWrapped all round in a thick casing of pottery, the meat keeps fresh\r\nas long as is required by the duration of the hatching-process, a\r\ndetail which I have not ascertained; in its cell, which is also of\r\nclay, the egg lies safe. Capital; so far, all is well. _Phanaeus\r\nMilon_ is thoroughly acquainted with the secrets of fortification and\r\nthe danger of victuals evaporating too soon. There remain the germ's\r\nrespiratory requirements.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy these, the insect has been equally well-inspired. The neck\r\nof the calabash is pierced, in the direction of its axis, with a tiny\r\nchannel which would admit at most the slenderest of straws. Inside,\r\nthis conduit opens at the top of the dome of the hatching-chamber;\r\noutside, at the tip of the nipple, it spreads into a wide mouth. This\r\nis the ventilating-shaft, protected against intruders by its extreme\r\nnarrowness and by grains of dust which obstruct it a little without\r\nstopping it up. I said it was simply marvellous. Was I wrong? If a\r\nconstruction of this sort is a fortuitous result, we must admit that\r\nblind chance is gifted with extraordinary powers of foresight.\r\n\r\nHow does the clumsy insect manage to accomplish so delicate and\r\ncomplex a piece of building? Exploring the pampas as I do through the\r\neyes of an intermediary, my only guide in this question is the\r\nstructure of the work, a structure whence we can deduct the workman's\r\nmethod without going far astray. I therefore imagine the building to\r\nproceed in this manner: a small carcase is found, the oozing of which\r\nhas softened the underlying loam. The insect collects more or less of\r\nthis loam, according to the richness of the vein. There are no precise\r\nlimits here. If the plastic material be plentiful, the collector is\r\nlavish with it and the provision-box becomes all the more solid. Then\r\nenormous calabashes are obtained, exceeding a Hen's egg in volume and\r\nformed of an outer wall three-quarters of an inch thick. But a mass of\r\nthis description is beyond the strength of the modeller, is badly\r\nhandled and betrays, in its shape, the awkwardness attendant on an\r\nover-difficult task. If the material be rare, the insect confines its\r\nharvesting to what is strictly necessary; and then, freer in its\r\nmovements, it obtains a magnificently regular gourd.\r\n\r\nThe loam is probably first kneaded into a ball and then scooped out\r\ninto a large and very thick cup by the pressure of the fore-legs and\r\nthe work of the forehead. Even thus do the Copris and the Sacred\r\nBeetle act when preparing, on the top of their round pill, the bowl in\r\nwhich the egg will be laid before the final manipulation of the ovoid\r\nor pear.\r\n\r\nIn this first business, the Phanaeus is simply a potter. So long as it\r\nbe plastic, any clay serves her turn, however meagrely saturated with\r\nthe juices running from the carcase.\r\n\r\nShe now becomes a pork-butcher. With her toothed knife, she carves,\r\nshe saws some tiny shreds from the rotten animal; she tears off, cuts\r\naway what she deems best suited to the grub's entertainment. She\r\ncollects all these fragments and mixes them with choice loam in the\r\nspots where the sanies abounds. The whole, cunningly kneaded and\r\nsoftened, becomes a ball made on the spot, without any\r\nrolling-process, in the same way as the sphere of the other\r\npill-manufacturers. Let us add that this ball, a ration calculated by\r\nthe needs of the grub, is very nearly constant in size, whatever the\r\ndimensions of the final calabash.\r\n\r\nThe sausage-meat is now ready. It is set in place in the wide-open\r\nclay bowl. Loosely packed, without compression, the food will remain\r\nfree, will not stick to its wrapper.\r\n\r\nNext, the potter's work is renewed. The insect presses the thick lips\r\nof the clay cup, rolls them out and applies them to the prepared\r\nforce-meat, which is eventually contained by a thin partition at the\r\ntop end and by a thick layer every elsewhere. A wide circular pad is\r\nleft on the top partition, which is thin in view of the weakness of\r\nthe grub that is to perforate it later, when making for the\r\nprovisions. Manipulated in its turn, this pad is converted into a\r\nhemispherical hollow, in which the egg is forthwith laid.\r\n\r\nThe work is completed by rolling out and joining the edges of the\r\nlittle crater, which closes and becomes the hatching-chamber. Here,\r\nespecially, a delicate dexterity becomes essential. At the same time\r\nthat the nipple of the calabash is being shaped, the insect, when\r\npacking the material, must leave the little channel which is to form\r\nthe ventilating-shaft, following the line of the axis. This narrow\r\nconduit, which an ill-calculated pressure might stop up beyond hope of\r\nremedy, seems to me extremely difficult to obtain. The most skilful of\r\nour potters could not manage it without the aid of a needle, which he\r\nwould afterwards withdraw. The insect, a sort of jointed automaton,\r\nmakes its channel through the massive nipple of the gourd without so\r\nmuch as a thought. If it did give it a thought, it would not succeed.\r\n\r\nThe calabash is made: there remains the decoration. This is the work\r\nof patient after-touches which perfect the curves and leave on the\r\nsoft loam a series of stippled impressions similar to those which the\r\npotter of prehistoric days distributed over his big-bellied jars with\r\nthe ball of his thumb.\r\n\r\nThat finishes the work. The insect will begin all over again under a\r\nfresh carcase; for each burrow has one calabash and no more, even as\r\nwith the Sacred Beetle and her pears.\r\n\r\nHere is another of these artists of the pampas. All black and as big\r\nas the largest of our Onthophagi,[18] whom she greatly resembles in\r\ngeneral build, _Canthon bispinus_ is likewise an exploiter of dead\r\nbodies, if not always on her own behalf, at least on that of her\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Cf. _The Sacred Beetle and Others_: chaps. xi. xvii.,\r\nand xviii.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nShe introduces very original innovations into the pill-maker's art.\r\nHer work, strewn like the aforementioned with finger-prints, is the\r\npilgrim's gourd, the double-bellied gourd. Of the two stories, which\r\nare joined together by a fairly plainly-marked groove, the upper is\r\nthe smaller and contains the egg in an incubating-chamber; the lower\r\nand bulkier is the food-stack.\r\n\r\nImagine the Sisyphus' little pear with its hatching-chamber swollen\r\ninto a globule a trifle smaller than the sphere at the other end;\r\nsuppose the two protuberances to be divided by a sort of wide open\r\ngroove like that of a pulley; and we shall have something very like\r\nthe Canthon's work in shape and size.\r\n\r\nWhen placed on burning charcoal, this double-bellied gourd turns\r\nblack, becomes covered with shiny warts that look like jet beads,\r\nemits a smell like that of grilled meat and leaves a residue of red\r\nclay. It is therefore formed of clay and sanies. Moreover, the paste\r\nis sprinkled with little scraps of dead flesh. At the smaller end is\r\nthe egg, in a chamber with a very porous roof, to allow the air to\r\nenter.\r\n\r\nThe little undertaker has something better to show than her double\r\nsausage. Like the Bison Onitis, the Sisyphus and the Lunary Copris,\r\nshe enjoys the collaboration of the father. Each burrow contains\r\nseveral cradles, with the father and mother invariably present. What\r\nare the two inseparables doing? They are watching their brood and, by\r\ndint of assiduous repairs, keeping the little sausages, which are in\r\nconstant danger of cracking or drying up, in good condition.\r\n\r\nThe magic carpet which has allowed me to take this trip to the pampas\r\nsupplies me with nothing else worth noting. Besides, the New World is\r\npoor in pill-rollers and cannot compare with Senegambia and the\r\nregions of the Upper Nile, that paradise of Copres and Sacred Beetles.\r\nNevertheless we owe it one precious detail: the group which is\r\ncommonly known by the name of Dung-beetles is divided into two\r\ncorporations, one of which exploits dung, the other corpses.\r\n\r\nWith very few exceptions, the latter has no representatives in our\r\nclimes. I have mentioned the little Oval Onthophagus as a lover of\r\ncarrion corruption; and my memory does not recall any other example of\r\nthe kind. We have to go to the other world to find such tastes.\r\n\r\nCan it be that there was a schism among the primitive scavengers and\r\nthat these, at first addicted to the same industry, afterwards divided\r\nthe hygienic task, some burying the ordure of the intestines, the\r\nothers the ordure of death? Can the comparative frequency of this or\r\nthe other provender have brought about the formation of two\r\ntrade-guilds?\r\n\r\nThat is not admissible. Life is inseparable from death; wherever a\r\ncorpse is, there also, scattered at random, are the digestive residues\r\nof the live animal; and the pill-roller is not fastidious as to the\r\norigin of this waste matter. Dearth therefore plays no part in the\r\nschism, if the true dung-worker has actually turned himself into an\r\nundertaker, or if the undertaker has turned himself into a true\r\ndung-worker. At no time have materials for the work been lacking in\r\neither case.\r\n\r\nNothing, not the scarcity of provisions, nor the climate, nor the\r\nreversed seasons, would explain this strange divergence. We must\r\nperforce regard it as a matter of original specialities, of tastes not\r\nacquired but prescribed from the beginning. And what prescribed them\r\nwas anything but the structure.\r\n\r\nI would defy the greatest expert to tell me, simply from the insect's\r\nappearance and without learning the facts by experiment, the manner of\r\nindustry to which _Phanaeus Milon_, for instance, devotes himself.\r\nRemembering the Onites, who are very similar in shape and who\r\nmanipulate stercoral matter, he would look upon the foreigner as\r\nanother manipulator of dung. He would be mistaken: the analysis of the\r\nmeat-pie has told us so.\r\n\r\nThe shape does not make the real Dung-beetle. I have in my collection\r\na magnificent insect from Cayenne, known to the nomenclators as\r\n_Phanaeus festivus_, a brilliant Beetle in festive attire, charming,\r\nbeautiful, glorious to behold. How well he deserves his name! His\r\ncolouring is a metallic red, which flashes with the fire of rubies;\r\nand he sets off this splendid jewellery by studding his corselet with\r\ngreat spots of glowing black.\r\n\r\nWhat trade do you follow under your torrid sun, O gleaming carbuncle?\r\nHave you the bucolic tastes of your rival in finery, the Splendid\r\nPhanaeus? Can you be a knacker, a worker in putrid sausage-meat, like\r\n_Phanaeus Milon_? Vainly do I consider you and marvel at you: your\r\nequipment tells me nothing. No one who has not seen you at work is\r\ncapable of naming your profession. I leave the matter to the\r\nconscientious masters, to the experts who are able to say: I do not\r\nknow. They are scarce, in our days; but after all there are some, less\r\neager than others in the unscrupulous struggle which creates upstarts.\r\n\r\nThis excursion to the pampas leans to one conclusion of some\r\nimportance. We find in another hemisphere, with reversed seasons, a\r\ndifferent climate and dissimilar biological conditions, a series of\r\ntrue dung-workers whose habits and industry repeat, in their essential\r\nfacts, the habits and industry of our own. Prolonged investigations,\r\nmade at first hand and not, like mine, at second hand, would add\r\ngreatly to the list of similar workers.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not only in the grassy plains of La Plata that the modellers\r\nof dung proceed according to the principles usual over here; we may\r\nsay, without fear of being mistaken, that the magnificent Copres of\r\nEthiopia and the big Sacred Beetles of Senegambia work exactly like\r\nour own.\r\n\r\nThe same similarity of industry exists in other entomological series,\r\nhowever distant their country. My books give details of a\r\nPelopaeus[19] in Sumatra, who is an ardent Spider-huntress like our\r\nown, who builds mud cells inside houses and who, like her, is fond of\r\nthe loose hangings of the window-curtains for the shifting foundation\r\nof her nests. They tell me of a Scolia[20] in Madagascar who serves\r\neach of her grubs with a fat rasher, an Oryctes-larva,[21] even as our\r\nown Scoliae feed their family on prey of similar organization, with a\r\nhighly concentrated nervous system, such as the larvae of Cetoniae,\r\nAnoxiae and even Oryctes. They tell me that in Texas a Pepsis, a\r\nhuntress of big game akin to the Calicurgi, gives chase to a\r\nformidable Tarantula and vies in daring with our Ringed\r\nCalicurgus,[22] who stabs the Black-bellied Lycosa.[23] They tell me\r\nthat the Sphex-wasps of the Sahara, a rival of our own White-banded\r\nSphex,[24] operate on Locusts. But we must limit these quotations,\r\nwhich could easily be multiplied.\r\n\r\n[Footnote  19: Cf. _The Mason-wasps_, by J. Henri Fabre, translated by\r\nAlexander Teixeira de Mattos: chaps. iii. to vi.--_Translator's\r\nNote_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: The chapters on the Scoliae will appear in _More Hunting\r\nWasps_. Meanwhile, cf. _The Life and Love of the Insect_, by J.

It is a\r\nvague, elastic phrase, which does not compromise us by compelling us\r\nto be too precise and it supplies an apparent explanation of the\r\ninexplicable. But is this influence so powerful as they say?\r\n\r\nI grant you that to some small extent it modifies the shape, the fur\r\nor feather, the colouring, the outward accessories. To go farther\r\nwould be to fly in the face of facts. If the surroundings become too\r\nexacting, the animal protests against the violence endured and\r\nsuccumbs rather than change. If they go to work gently, the creature\r\nsubjected to them adapts itself as best it can, but invincibly refuses\r\nto cease to be what it is. It must live in the form of the mould\r\nwhence it issued, or it must die: there is no other alternative.\r\n\r\nInstinct, one of the higher characteristics, is no less rebellious to\r\nthe injunctions of environment than are the organs, which serve its\r\nactivity. Innumerable guilds divide the work of the entomological\r\nworld; and each member of one of these corporations is subject to\r\nrules which not climate, nor latitude, nor the most serious\r\ndisturbances of diet are able to alter.\r\n\r\nLook at the Dung-beetles of the pampas. At the other end of the world,\r\nin their vast flooded pastures, so different from our scanty\r\ngreenswards, they follow, without notable variations, the same methods\r\nas their colleagues in Provence. A profound change of surroundings in\r\nno way effects the fundamental industry of the group.\r\n\r\nNor do the provisions available affect it. The staple food to-day is\r\nmatter of bovine origin. But the Ox is a newcomer in the land, an\r\nimportation of the Spanish conquest. What did the Megathopae, the\r\nBolbites, the Splendid Phanaeus eat and knead, before the arrival of\r\nthe present purveyor? The Llama, that denizen of the uplands, was not\r\nable to feed the Dung-beetles confined to the plains. In days of old,\r\nthe foster-father was perhaps the monstrous Megatherium, a\r\ndung-factory of incomparable prodigality.\r\n\r\nAnd from the produce of the colossal beast, whereof naught remains but\r\na few rare skeletons, the modellers passed to the produce of the Sheep\r\nand the Ox, without altering their ovoids or their gourds, even as our\r\nSacred Beetle, without ceasing to be faithful to her pear, accepts the\r\nCow's flat cake in the absence of the favourite morsel, the Sheep's\r\nbannock.\r\n\r\nIn the south as in the north, at the antipodes as here, every Copris\r\nfashions ovoids with the egg at the smaller end; every Sacred Beetle\r\nmodels pears or gourds with a hatching-chamber in the neck; but the\r\nmaterials employed vary greatly according to the season and locality\r\nand can be furnished by the Megatherium, the Ox, the Horse, the Sheep\r\nor by man and several others.\r\n\r\nWe must not allow this diversity to lead us to believe in changes of\r\ninstinct: that would be to strain at a Gnat and swallow a Camel. The\r\nindustry of the Megachiles, for instance, consists of manufacturing\r\nwallets with bits of leaves; that of the Cotton-bees of making bags of\r\nwadding with the flock gathered from certain plants. Whether the\r\npieces be cut from the leaves of this shrub or that, or at need from\r\nthe petals of some flower; whether the cotton-wool be collected here\r\nor there, as chance may direct the encounter, the industry undergoes\r\nno essential changes.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, nothing changes in the art of the Dung-beetle,\r\nvictualling himself with materials in this mine or that. Here in truth\r\nwe have immutable instinct, here we behold the rock which our\r\ntheorists are unable to shake.\r\n\r\nAnd why should it change, this instinct, so logical in its workings?\r\nWhere could it find, even with chance assisting, a better plan? In\r\nspite of an equipment which varies in the different genera, it\r\nsuggests to every modelling Dung-beetle the spherical shape, a\r\nfundamental structure which is hardly affected when the egg is placed\r\nin position.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, without the use of compasses, without any mechanical\r\nrolling, without shifting the thing on its base, one and all obtain\r\nthe ball, the delicately executed compact body supremely favourable to\r\nthe grub's well-being. To the shapeless lump, demanding no pains, they\r\nall prefer the sphere, lovingly fashioned and calling for much\r\nmanipulation, the globe which is the preeminent form and best-adapted\r\nfor the preservation of energy, in the case of a sun and of a\r\nDung-beetle's cradle alike.\r\n\r\nWhen Macleay[25] gave the Sacred Beetle the name of Heliocantharus,\r\nthe Black-beetle of the Sun, what had he in mind? The radiating\r\ndenticulations of the forehead, the insect's gambols in the bright\r\nsunlight? Was he not thinking rather of the symbol of Egypt, the\r\nScarab who, on the pediment of the temples, lifts towards the sky, by\r\nway of a pill, a vermilion sphere, the image of the sun?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: William Sharp Macleay (1792-1865), author of _Horae\r\nEntomologicae_; or, _Essays on Annulose Animals_ (1819-1821), on which\r\nI quote the _Dictionary of National Biography_:\r\n\r\n\"He propounded the circular or quinary system, a forcedly artificial\r\nattempt at a natural system of classification, which soon became a\r\nbyword among naturalists.\"--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThe comparison between the mighty bodies of the universe and the\r\ninsect's humble pellet was not distasteful to the thinkers on the\r\nbanks of the Nile. For them supreme splendour found its effigy in\r\nextreme abjection. Were they very wrong?\r\n\r\nNo, for the pill-roller's work propounds a grave problem to whoso is\r\ncapable of reflection. It compels us to accept this alternative:\r\neither to credit the Dung-beetle's flat head with the signal honour of\r\nhaving of itself solved the geometrical problem of preserved food, or\r\nelse to fall back upon a harmony ruling all things under the eye of an\r\nIntelligence Which, knowing everything, has provided for everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nINSECT COLOURING\r\n\r\n\r\n_Phanaeus splendidulus_, the glittering, the resplendent: this is the\r\nepithet selected by the official nomenclators to describe the\r\nhandsomest Dung-beetle of the pampas. The name is not at all\r\nexaggerated. Combining the fire of gems with metallic lustre, the\r\ninsect, according to the incidence of the light, emits the green\r\nreflections of the emerald or the gleam of ruddy copper. The\r\nmuck-raker would do honour to the jeweller's show-cases.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, our own Dung-beetles, though usually modest in their\r\nattire, also have a leaning toward luxurious ornament. One Onthophagus\r\ndecorates his corselet with Florentine bronze; another wears garnets\r\non his wing-cases. Black above, the Mimic Geotrupes is the colour of\r\ncopper pyrites below; also black in all parts exposed to the light of\r\nday, the Stercoraceous Geotrupes displays a ventral surface of a\r\nglorious amethyst violet.\r\n\r\nMany other series, of greatly varied habits, Carabi,[1] Cetoniae,\r\nBuprestes, Chrysomelae,[2] rival and even surpass the magnificent\r\nDung-beetles in the matter of jewellery. At times we encounter\r\nsplendours which the imagination of a lapidary would not venture to\r\ndepict. The Azure Hoplia,[3] the inmate of the osier-beds and elders\r\nby the banks of the mountain streams, is a wonderful blue, tenderer\r\nand softer to the eye than the azure of the heavens. You could not\r\nfind an ornament to match it save on the throats of certain\r\nHumming-birds and the wings of a few Butterflies in equatorial climes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Cf. Chapter XIV. of the present volume.--_Translator's\r\nNote_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Golden Apple-beetles.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: A genus of Cockchafer. Cf. _The Life of the Fly_: chap.\r\nvii.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nTo adorn itself like this, in what Golconda does the insect gather its\r\ngems? In what diggings does it find its gold nuggets? What a pretty\r\nproblem is that of a Buprestis' wing-case! Here the chemistry of\r\ncolours ought to reap a delightful harvest; but the difficulties are\r\ngreat, it seems, so much so that science cannot yet tell us the why\r\nand the wherefore of the humblest costume. The answer will come in a\r\nremote future, if indeed it ever comes completely, for life's\r\nlaboratory may well contain secrets denied to our retorts. For the\r\nmoment, I shall perhaps be contributing a grain of sand to the future\r\npalace if I describe the little that I have seen.\r\n\r\nMy basic observation dates a long way back. I was at that time busy\r\nwith the Hunting Wasps, following their larval development from the\r\negg to the cocoon. Let us take an instance from my notes, which cover\r\nnearly all the game-hunters of my district. I will choose the larva of\r\nthe Yellow-winged Sphex,[4] which, with its convenient size, will\r\nfurnish an easy object-lesson.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Cf. _The Hunting Wasps_: chap. iv.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nUnder the transparent skin of the larva, which has been recently\r\nhatched and is consuming its first Cricket, we soon perceive some fine\r\nwhite spots, which rapidly increase in size and number and eventually\r\ncover the whole body, except the first two or three segments. On\r\ndissecting the grub, we find that these spots have to do with the\r\nadipose layer, of which they form a considerable part, for, far from\r\nbeing scattered only on the surface, they run through its whole\r\nthickness and are present in such numbers that the forceps cannot\r\nseize the least fragment of this tissue without picking up a few of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThough perfectly visible without the help of a lens, these puzzling\r\nspots call for the microscope if we wish to study them in detail. We\r\nthen find that the adipose tissue is made up of two kinds of vesicles:\r\nsome, bright yellow and transparent, are filled with oily drops; the\r\nrest, opaque and starch-white, are distended with a very fine powder,\r\nwhich spreads in a cloudy trail when the vesicle containing it is\r\nbroken on the object-slide. Intermingled without apparent order, the\r\ntwo kinds of bags are of the same shape and the same size. The first\r\ngo to make up the nutritive reserves, the fatty tissue properly\r\nso-called; the second form the white dots which we will study for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nAn inspection under the microscope tells us that the contents of the\r\nwhite cells are composed of very fine, opaque grains, insoluble in\r\nwater and of greater density. The use of chemical reagents on the\r\nobject-slide proves that nitric acid dissolves these grains, with\r\neffervescence and without leaving the least residue, even when they\r\nare still enclosed in their vesicles. On the other hand, the true\r\nfatty cells suffer in no way when attacked by this acid; they merely\r\nturn a little yellower.\r\n\r\nLet us take advantage of this property to operate on a larger scale.\r\nThe adipose tissue taken from a number of larvae is treated with\r\nnitric acid. The effervescence is as lively as if the reaction were\r\ntaking effect on a bit of chalk. When it has subsided, some yellow\r\nclots are floating on the surface. These are easily separated. They\r\ncome from the fatty substance and the cellular membranes. There\r\nremains a clear liquid containing the white granules in solution.\r\n\r\nThe riddle of these granules was being presented to me for the first\r\ntime; my predecessors had provided no physiological or anatomical data\r\nto guide me; great therefore was my joy when, after a little fumbling,\r\nI succeeded in hitting upon their characteristic feature.\r\n\r\nThe solution is evaporated in a small porcelain capsule, placed on the\r\nhot embers. On the residue I pour a few drops of ammonia, or else\r\nsimply water. A glorious crimson colour at once makes its appearance.\r\nThe problem is solved: the colouring-matter which has just formed is\r\nmurexide; and consequently the powdery substance which filled the\r\ncells was none other than uric acid, or more precisely ammonium urate.\r\n\r\nA physiological fact of this importance can hardly stand alone.\r\nIndeed, since this basic experiment I have discovered grains of uric\r\nacid in the adipose tissue of the larvae of all the Hunting Wasps of\r\nour parts, as well as in the Bees at the moment of the nymphosis. I\r\nhave observed them in many other insects, either in the larval or in\r\nthe perfect state; but in this respect there is none to equal the grub\r\nof the game-hunting Wasp, which is all speckled with white. I think I\r\nsee the reason.\r\n\r\nLet us consider two larvae which eat live prey: that of the Sphex and\r\nthat of the Hydrophilus.[5] Uric acid, the inevitable product of the\r\nvital transformations, or at all events one of its analogues, must be\r\nformed in both. But the Hydrophilus' larva shows no accumulation of it\r\nin its adipose layer, whereas the Sphex' is full of it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The Great Water-beetle.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nIn the latter the duct through which the solid excretions pass is not\r\nyet in working order; the digestive apparatus, tied at the lower end,\r\nis not discharging an atom. The urinary products, being unable, for\r\nwant of an open outlet, to flow away as formed, accumulate in the\r\nadipose tissue, which thus serves as a common store-house for the\r\nresidues of the present and the plastic material of the future organic\r\nprocesses. Here something occurs analogous to what we see in the\r\nhigher animals after the removal of the kidneys; the urea at first\r\ncontained in the blood, in imperceptible quantities accumulates and\r\nbecomes manifest when the means by which it is eliminated disappear.\r\n\r\nIn the larva of the Hydrophilus, on the other hand, the excretions\r\nenjoy a free outlet from the beginning; and the urinary products\r\nescape as and when formed and are no longer deposited in the adipose\r\ntissue. But during the intense labour of the metamorphosis, any\r\nexcretion becomes impossible; the uric acid must and does collect in\r\nthe adipose substance of the different larvae.\r\n\r\nIt would be out of place, despite its importance, to pursue the\r\nproblem of the uric residues any further. Our subject is coloration.\r\nLet us return to it with the evidence supplied by the Sphex. Her\r\nalmost transparent larva has the neutral tint of fluid white of egg.\r\nUnder its fine translucid skin there is nothing coloured, save the\r\nlong digestive pouch, which is swollen a deep purple by the pulp of\r\nthe consumed Crickets. But against this indefinite, vitreous\r\nbackground the opaque white uric cells stand out distinctly in their\r\nmyriads; and the effect of this stippling is a sketchy but by no means\r\ninelegant costume. It is skimpy in the extreme, but at any rate it is\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nWith the urinary broth of which its intestine is unable to get rid,\r\nthe larva has discovered a means of making itself look a little smart.\r\nThe Anthidia have shown us how, in their cotton-wool wallets, they\r\nmanufacture a sort of jewellery with their ordure. The robe studded\r\nwith grains of alabaster is a no less ingenious invention.\r\n\r\nTo beautify themselves cheaply by using up their own refuse is a very\r\ncommon method even among insects endowed with all that is wanted for\r\nevacuating waste matter. While the larvae of the Hunting Wasps, unable\r\nto do better, stipple themselves with uric acid, there are plenty of\r\nindustrious creatures that are able to make themselves a superb dress\r\nby preserving their excretions in spite of their own open sewers. With\r\na view to self-embellishment, they collect and treasure up the dross\r\nwhich others hasten to expel. They turn filth into finery.\r\n\r\nOne of these is the White-faced Decticus (_D. albifrons_, FAB.), the\r\nbiggest sabre-bearer of the Provencal fauna. A magnificent insect is\r\nthis Grasshopper, with a broad ivory face, a full, creamy-white belly\r\nand long wings flecked with brown. In July, the season for the\r\nwedding-dress, let us dissect him under water.\r\n\r\nThe adipose tissue, which is abundant and yellowish white, consists of\r\na lace of wide, irregular, criss-cross meshes. It is a tubular network\r\nswollen with a powdery matter which condenses into minute chalk-white\r\nspots, standing out very plainly against a transparent background.\r\nWhen crushed in a drop of water, a fragment of this fabric yields a\r\nmilky cloud in which the microscope shows an infinite number of opaque\r\nfloating atoms, without revealing the smallest blob of oil, the sign\r\nof fatty matter.\r\n\r\nHere again we have ammonium urate. Treated with nitric acid, the\r\nadipose tissue of the Decticus produces an effervescence similar to\r\nthat of chalk and yields enough murexide to redden a tumblerful of\r\nwater. A strange adipose body, this bundle of lace crammed with uric\r\nacid without a trace of fatty matter! What would the Decticus do with\r\nnutritive reserves, seeing that he is near his end, now that the\r\nnuptial season has arrived? Delivered from the necessity of saving for\r\nthe future, he has only to spend in gaiety the few days left to him;\r\nhe has only to adorn himself for the supreme festival.\r\n\r\nHe therefore converts into a paint-factory what at first was a\r\nwarehouse for storing up foodstuffs; and with his chalk-like uric pulp\r\nhe lavishly daubs his belly, which turns a creamy white, and smears it\r\non his forehead, his face, his cheeks, until they assume the\r\nappearance of old ivory. All those parts, in fact, which lie\r\nimmediately under the translucid skin are covered with a layer of\r\npigment which can be turned into murexide and is identical in nature\r\nwith the white powder of the adipose lace.\r\n\r\nBiological chemistry can hardly offer a simpler and more striking\r\nexperiment than this analysis of the Decticus' finery. To those who\r\nhave not this curious Grasshopper handy, I recommend the Ephippiger of\r\nthe Vines, who is much more widely distributed. His ventral surface,\r\nwhich also is of a creamy white, likewise owes its colour to a\r\nplastering of uric acid. In the Grasshopper family many other species\r\nof smaller size and requiring more delicate handling would give us the\r\nsame results in varying degrees.\r\n\r\nWhite, slightly tinged with yellow, is all that the urinary palette of\r\nthe Locustidae shows us. A caterpillar, the Spurge Hawk-moth's, will\r\ntake us a little farther. Dappled red, black, white and yellow, its\r\nlivery is the most remarkable in our part of the country. Reaumur in\r\nfact calls it _la Belle_. The flattering title is well-deserved. On\r\nthe black background of the larva, vermillion-red, chrome-yellow and\r\nchalk-white figure side by side in circles, spots, freckles and\r\nstripes, as clearly marked as the glaring patches of a harlequin's\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nLet us dissect the caterpillar and apply the lens to its mosaic. On\r\nthe inner surface of the skin, except in the portions coloured black,\r\nwe observe a pigmentary layer, a coating here red, there yellow or\r\nwhite. We will cut a strip from this coat of many colours, after\r\ndepriving it of its muscular fibres, and subject it to the action of\r\nnitric acid. The pigment, no matter what its hue, dissolves with\r\neffervescence and afterwards yields murexide. Here again, then, it is\r\nto uric acid, present, however, in small quantities in the adipose\r\ntissue, that the caterpillar's rich livery is due.\r\n\r\nThe black parts are an exception. Unassailable by nitric acid, they\r\nretain their sombre tint after treatment as before, whereas the\r\nportions stripped of their pigment by the reagent become almost as\r\ntransparent as glass. The skin of the handsome caterpillar thus has\r\ntwo sorts of coloured patches.\r\n\r\nThose of an intense black may be likened to dyers' products: they are\r\ncompletely impregnated with the colouring matter, which is part and\r\nparcel of the molecular constitution and cannot be isolated by the\r\nnitric solvent. The others, red, yellow or white, are actually\r\npainted: on a translucid sheet is a wash of urinary pigment, which is\r\ndischarged by the minute ducts issuing from the adipose layer. When\r\nthe action of the nitric acid has ceased, the transparent circles of\r\nthe latter stand out against the black background of the former.\r\n\r\nYet one more example taken from a different order. As regards elegance\r\nof costume, the Banded Epeira[6] is the most highly favoured of our\r\nSpiders. On the upper surface of her corpulent belly alternate, in\r\ntransversal bands, bright black, a vivid yellow like that of yolk of\r\negg and a dazzling white like that of snow. The black and yellow also\r\nshow underneath, but arranged differently. The yellow, in particular,\r\nforms two longitudinal ribbons, ending in orange-red on either side of\r\nthe spinnerets. A pale purple is faintly diffused over the sides.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Cf. _The Life of the Spider_: chaps. ii., vii., xi. and\r\nxiii.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nExamined from the outside with the lens, the black parts reveal\r\nnothing out of the common. The black is homogeneous and everywhere of\r\nequal depth. On the other hand, in the coloured portions, we see\r\nlittle polygonal, granular masses, forming a close-meshed network. By\r\ncutting round the circumference of the abdomen with a pair of\r\nscissors, the horny integument of the dorsal surface may readily be\r\nremoved in one piece, without any shreds of the organs which it\r\nprotected. This large strip of skin is transparent in the zones that\r\ncorrespond with the white bands in the natural state; it is black or\r\nyellow on the black or yellow bands. These last indeed owe their\r\ncolouring to a layer of pigment which the point of a paintbrush will\r\neasily loosen and remove.\r\n\r\nAs for the white bands, their origin is this: once the skin has been\r\nremoved, the dorsal surface of the abdomen, whose graceful mosaic is\r\nnot in any way disturbed, reveals a layer of polygonal white spots,\r\ndistributed in belts, here densely and there less so. The denser belts\r\ncorrespond with the white bands. It is their magnificent opaque white\r\ngranulations which, seen through the transparent skin, form the\r\nsnow-white stripes in the live Spider.\r\n\r\nTreated with nitric acid on the microscopic slide, they do not\r\ndissolve nor produce effervescence. Uric acid then is not present in\r\nthis case; and the substance must be guanine, an alkaloid known to be\r\nthe urinary product of the Spiders. The same is true of the yellow,\r\nblack, purple or orange pigment that forms a coating under the skin.\r\nIn short, by utilizing, in a different chemical combination, the waste\r\nproducts of animal oxidization, the magnificent Spider rivals the\r\nmagnificent caterpillar; she beautifies herself with guanine as the\r\nother does with its uric acid.\r\n\r\nLet us abridge this dry subject; let us be content with these few\r\ndata, which could if necessary be corroborated by many others. What\r\ndoes the little that we have learnt teach us? It tells us that the\r\nmaterials rejected by the organism, guanine, uric acid and other dross\r\nfrom life's refinery, play an important part in the coloration of the\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\nTwo cases are distinguishable, according as the colour is dyed or\r\nsimply painted. The skin, itself colourless and transparent, is in\r\nplaces illumined by a coloured varnish, which can be removed by a\r\ntouch with a paintbrush. Here we have paint, the result of the urinary\r\ncompound laid on the inner surface of the covering, just as the\r\nchromatic ingredients of our glass-painters are laid on our\r\nstained-glass windows.\r\n\r\nAt other places the skin is coloured in its very substance; the\r\ncolouring-matter forms an integral part of it and can no longer be\r\nswept away with a camel-hair brush. Here we have a dyed fabric,\r\nrepresented in our windows by the panes of coloured glass which the\r\ncrucible decorates uniformly with this or that tint, by means of the\r\nincorporated metallic oxides.\r\n\r\nWhereas, in these two cases, there is a profound difference in the\r\ndistribution of the chromatic materials, is this true of their\r\nchemical nature as well? The suggestion is hardly admissible. The\r\nworker in stained glass dyes or paints with the same oxides. Life,\r\nthat incomparable artist, must even more readily obtain an infinite\r\nvariety of results by uniformity of method.\r\n\r\nIt shows us, on the back of the Spurge Caterpillar,[7] black spots\r\njumbled up with other spots, white, yellow or red. Paints and dyes lie\r\nside by side. Is there on this side of the dividing line a paint-stuff\r\nand on the other side a dye-stuff, absolutely different in character\r\nfrom the first? While chemistry is not yet in a position to\r\ndemonstrate, with its reagents, the common origin of the two\r\nsubstances, at least the most convincing analogies point to it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The caterpillar of the Spurge Hawk-moth.--_Translator's\r\nNote_.]\r\n\r\nIn this delicate problem of the insect's colouring, one single point\r\nthus far comes within the domain of observed facts: the progressive\r\nadvance of chromatic evolution. The carbuncle of the Dung-Beetle of\r\nthe Pampas suggested the question. Let us then inquire of his near\r\nneighbours, who will perhaps enable us to advance a step farther.\r\n\r\nNewly stripped of his cast-off nymphal skin, the Sacred Beetle\r\npossesses a strange costume, bearing no resemblance to the ebony black\r\nwhich will be the portion of the mature insect. The head, legs and\r\nthorax are a bright rusty red; the wing-cases and abdomen are white.\r\nAs a colour, the red is almost that of the Spurge Caterpillar, but it\r\nis the result of a dye on which nitric acid has no effect as a\r\ndetector of urates. The same chromatic principle must certainly exist\r\nin a more elaborate form and under a different molecular arrangement\r\nin the skin of the abdomen and the wing-cases which will presently\r\nreplace white by red.\r\n\r\nIn two or three days the colourless becomes the coloured, a process\r\nwhose rapidity implies a fresh molecular structure rather than a\r\nchange of composition. The building-stone remains the same, but is\r\narranged in a different order; and the structure alters in appearance.\r\n\r\nThe Scarabaeus is now all red. The first brown stains show themselves\r\non the denticulations of the forehead and fore-legs, the sign of an\r\nearlier maturity in the implements of labour, which are to acquire an\r\nexceptional hardness. The smoky tinge spreads more or less all over\r\nthe insect, replaces the red, turns darker and finally becomes the\r\nregulation black. In less than a week the colourless insect turns a\r\nrusty red, next a sooty brown and then an ebony black. The process is\r\ncompleted; the insect possesses its normal colouring.\r\n\r\nEven so do the Copres, the Gymnopleuri,[8] the Onites, the Onthophagi\r\nand many others behave; even so must the jewel of the pampas, the\r\nSplendid Phanaeus set to work. With as much certainty as though I had\r\nhim before my eyes at the moment when he divests himself of his\r\nnymphal swaddling-bands, I see him a dull red, rusty or crimson,\r\nexcepting on the wing-covers and the abdomen, which are at first\r\ncolourless and presently turn the same colour as the rest. In the\r\nSacred Beetle this initial red is followed by black; the Phanaeus\r\nreplaces it by the brilliance of copper and the reflections of the\r\nemerald. Ebony, metal, the gem: have they the same origin here then?\r\nEvidently.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Cf. _The Sacred Beetle and Others_: chap.\r\nviii.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThe metallic lustre does not call for a change of nature; a mere\r\nnothing is enough to produce it. Silver, when very finely subdivided\r\nby the methods whereof chemistry knows the secret, becomes a dust as\r\npoor to look at as soot. When pressed between two hard bodies, this\r\ndirty powder, which might be dried mud, at once acquires the metallic\r\nsheen and again becomes the silver which we know. A mere molecular\r\ncontact has wrought the miracle.\r\n\r\nDissolved in water, the murexide derived from uric acid is a\r\nmagnificent crimson. Solidified by crystallization, it rivals in\r\nsplendour the gold-green of the Cantharides. The widely-used fuschine\r\naffords a well-known example of like properties.\r\n\r\nEverything, then, appears to show that the same substance, derived\r\nfrom urinary excretions, yields, according to the mode in which its\r\nultimate particles are grouped, the metallic red of the Phanaeus, as\r\nwell as the white, the dull red and the black of the Sacred Beetle. It\r\nbecomes black on the dorsal surface of the Stercoraceous Geotrupes and\r\nthe Mimic Geotrupes; and, with a quick change, it turns into amethyst\r\nunder the belly of the first and into copper pyrites under the belly\r\nof the second. It covers the back of _Cetonia floricola_ with golden\r\nbronze and the under surface with metallic purple. According to the\r\ninsect, according to the part of the body, it remains a dingy compound\r\nor sparkles with reflections even more vivid and varied than those\r\npossessed by the metals.\r\n\r\nLight seems irrelevant to the development of these splendours; it\r\nneither accelerates nor retards them. Since direct exposure to the\r\nsun, owing to the excess of heat, is fatal to the delicate process of\r\nthe nymphosis, I shaded the solar rays with a screen of water\r\ncontained between slips of glass; and to the bright light thus\r\nmoderated in temperature I daily, throughout the period of chromatic\r\nevolution, subjected a number of Sacred Beetles, Geotrupes and\r\nCetoniae. As standards of comparison I had witnesses of whom I kept\r\nsome in diffused light and others in complete darkness. My experiments\r\nhad no appreciable result. The development of the colours took place\r\nin the sunlight and in the dark alike, neither more rapidly nor more\r\nslowly and without difference in the tints.\r\n\r\nThis negative result was easy to foresee. The Buprestis emerging from\r\nthe depths of the trunk in which he has spent his larval life; the\r\nGeotrupes and the Phanaeus leaving their natal burrows possess their\r\nfinal adornments, which will not become richer in the rays of the sun,\r\nat the time when they make their appearance in the open air. The\r\ninsect does not claim the assistance of the light for its colour\r\nchemistry, not even the Cicada,[9] who bursts her larval scabbard and\r\nchanges from pale green to brown as easily in the darkness of my\r\napparatus as in the sunlight, in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Cf. _The Life of the Grasshopper_: chaps. i. to\r\nv.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThe chromatics of the insect, having as its basis the urinary waste\r\nproducts, might well be found in various animals of a higher order. We\r\nknow of at least one example. The pigment of a small American lizard\r\nis converted into uric acid under the prolonged action of boiling\r\nhydrochloric acid.[10] This cannot be an isolated instance; and there\r\nis reason to believe that the reptilian class daubs its garments with\r\nsimilar products.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: A. B. Griffiths, Transactions of the Academie des\r\nsciences, 26 November, 1894.--_Author's Note_.]\r\n\r\nFrom the reptile to the bird is no great distance. Then the\r\nWood-pigeon's iridescent hues, the eyes on the Peacock's tail, the\r\nKingfisher's sea-blue, the Flamingo's carmine are more or less closely\r\nconnected with the urinary excretions? Why not? Nature, that sublime\r\neconomist, delights in these vast antitheses which upset all our\r\nconceptions of the values of things. Of a pinch of common charcoal she\r\nmakes a diamond; of the same clay which the potter fashions into a\r\nbowl for the Cat's supper she makes a ruby; of the filthy waste\r\nproducts of the organism she makes the splendours of the insect and\r\nthe bird. The metallic marvels of the Buprestis and the Ground-beetle;\r\nthe amethyst, ruby, sapphire, emerald and topaz of the Humming-bird;\r\nglories which would exhaust the language of the lapidary jeweller:\r\nwhat are they in reality? Answer: a drop of urine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nTHE BURYING-BEETLES: THE BURIAL\r\n\r\n\r\nBeside the footpath in April lies the Mole, disembowelled by the\r\npeasant's spade; at the foot of the hedge the pitiless urchin has\r\nstoned to death the Lizard, who was about to don his green,\r\npearl-embellished costume. The passer-by has thought it a meritorious\r\ndeed to crush beneath his heel the chance-met Adder; and a gust of\r\nwind has thrown a tiny unfledged bird from its nest. What will become\r\nof these little bodies and so many other pitiful remnants of life?\r\nThey will not long offend our sense of sight and smell. The sanitary\r\nofficers of the fields are legion.\r\n\r\nAn eager freebooter, ready for any task, the Ant is the first to come\r\nhastening and begin, particle by particle, to dissect the corpse. Soon\r\nthe odour attracts the Fly, the genitrix of the odious maggot. At the\r\nsame time, the flattened Silpha,[1] the glistening, slow-trotting\r\nCellar-beetle, the Dermestes,[2] powdered with snow upon the abdomen,\r\nand the slender Staphylinus,[3] all, whence coming no one knows, hurry\r\nhither in squads, with never-wearied zeal, investigating, probing and\r\ndraining the infection.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Or Carrion-beetle.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Or Bacon-beetle.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Or Rove-beetle.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nWhat a spectacle, in the spring, beneath a dead Mole! The horror of\r\nthis laboratory is a beautiful sight for one who is able to observe\r\nand to meditate. Let us overcome our disgust; let us turn over the\r\nunclean refuse with our foot. What a swarming there is beneath it,\r\nwhat a tumult of busy workers! The Silphae, with wing-cases wide and\r\ndark, as though in mourning, flee distraught, hiding in the cracks in\r\nthe soil; the Saprini,[4] of polished ebony which mirrors the\r\nsunlight, jog hastily off, deserting their workshop; the Dermestes, of\r\nwhom one wears a fawn-coloured tippet flecked with white, seek to fly\r\naway, but, tipsy with the putrid nectar, tumble over and reveal the\r\nimmaculate whiteness of their bellies, which forms a violent contrast\r\nwith the gloom of the rest of their attire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The Saprinus is a very small carnivorous Beetle. Cf. _The\r\nLife of the Fly_: chap. xvi.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nWhat were they doing there, all these feverish workers? They were\r\nmaking a clearance of death on behalf of life. Transcendent\r\nalchemists, they were transforming that horrible putrescence into a\r\nliving and inoffensive product. They were draining the dangerous\r\ncorpse to the point of rendering it as dry and sonorous as the remains\r\nof an old slipper hardened on the refuse-heap by the frosts of winter\r\nand the heats of summer. They were working their hardest to render the\r\ncarrion innocuous.\r\n\r\nOthers will soon put in their appearance, smaller creatures and more\r\npatient, who will take over the relic and exploit it ligament by\r\nligament, bone by bone, hair by hair, until the whole has been\r\nrestored to the treasury of life. All honour to these purifiers! Let\r\nus put back the Mole and go our way.\r\n\r\nSome other victim of the agricultural labours of spring, a\r\nShrew-mouse, Field-mouse, Mole, Frog, Adder, or Lizard, will provide\r\nus with the most vigorous and famous of these expurgators of the soil.\r\nThis is the Burying-beetle, the Necrophorus, so different from the\r\ncadaveric mob in dress and habits. In honour of his exalted functions\r\nhe exhales an odour of musk; he bears a red tuft at the tip of his\r\nantennae; his breast is covered with nankeen; and across his\r\nwing-cases he wears a double, scalloped scarf of vermillion. An\r\nelegant, almost sumptuous costume, very superior to that of the\r\nothers, but yet lugubrious, as befits your undertaker's man.\r\n\r\nHe is no anatomical dissector, cutting his subject open, carving its\r\nflesh with the scalpel of his mandibles; he is literally a\r\ngrave-digger, a sexton. While the others--Silphae, Dermestes,\r\nCellar-beetles--gorge themselves with the exploited flesh, without, of\r\ncourse, forgetting the interests of the family, he, a frugal eater,\r\nhardly touches his find on his own account. He buries it entire, on\r\nthe spot, in a cellar where the thing, duly ripened, will form the\r\ndiet of his larvae. He buries it in order to establish his progeny.\r\n\r\nThis hoarder of dead bodies, with his stiff and almost heavy\r\nmovements, is astonishingly quick at storing away wreckage. In a shift\r\nof a few hours, a comparatively enormous animal, a Mole, for instance,\r\ndisappears, engulfed by the earth. The others leave the dried, emptied\r\ncarcass to the air, the sport of the winds for months on end; he,\r\ntreating it as a whole, makes a clean job of things at once. No\r\nvisible trace of his work remains but a tiny hillock, a burial-mound,\r\na tumulus.\r\n\r\nWith his expeditious method, the Necrophorus is the first of the\r\nlittle purifiers of the fields. He is also one of the most celebrated\r\nof insects in respect of his psychical capacities. This undertaker is\r\nendowed, they say, with intellectual faculties approaching to reason,\r\nsuch as are not possessed by the most gifted of the Bees and Wasps,\r\nthe collectors of honey or game. He is honoured by the two following\r\nanecdotes, which I quote from Lacordaire's[5] _Introduction a\r\nl'entomologie_, the only general treatise at my disposal:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Clairville,\" says the author, \"reports that he saw a _Necrophorus\r\nvespillo_, who, wishing to bury a dead Mouse and finding the soil on\r\nwhich the body lay too hard, went to dig a hole at some distance, in\r\nsoil more easily displaced. This operation completed, he attempted to\r\nbury the Mouse in the cavity, but, not succeeding, he flew away and\r\nreturned a few moments later, accompanied by four of his fellows, who\r\nassisted him to move the Mouse and bury it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Jean Theodore Lacordaire (1801-1870), author of _Genera\r\ndes coleopteres_ (1854-1876) and of the work quoted above\r\n(1837-1839).--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nIn such actions, Lacordaire adds, we cannot refuse to admit the\r\nintervention of reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The following case,\" he continues, \"recorded by Gleditsch,[6] has\r\nalso every indication of the intervention of reason. One of his\r\nfriends, wishing to desiccate a Frog, placed it on the top of a stick\r\nthrust into the ground, in order to make sure that the Necrophori\r\nshould not come and carry it off. But this precaution was of no\r\neffect; the insects, being unable to reach the Frog, dug under the\r\nstick and, having caused it to fall, buried it as well as the\r\nbody.\"[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Johann Gottlieb Gleditsch (1714-1786), the German\r\nbotanist.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Suites a Buffon. Introduction a l'entomologie_, vol.\r\nii., pp. 460-61.--_Author's Note_.]\r\n\r\nTo grant, in the intellect of the insect, a lucid understanding of the\r\nrelations between cause and effect, between the end and the means, is\r\nto make a statement of serious import. I know of scarcely any more\r\nsuited to the philosophical brutalities of my time. But are these two\r\nanecdotes really true? Do they involve the consequences deduced from\r\nthem? Are not those who accept them as sound evidence just a little\r\ntoo simple?\r\n\r\nTo be sure, simplicity is needed in entomology. Without a good dose of\r\nthis quality, a mental defect in the eyes of practical folk, who would\r\nbusy himself with the lesser creatures? Yes, let us be simple, without\r\nbeing childishly credulous. Before making insects reason, let us\r\nreason a little ourselves; let us, above all, consult the experimental\r\ntest. A fact gathered at random, without criticism, cannot establish a\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nI do not propose, O valiant grave-diggers, to depreciate your merits;\r\nsuch is far from being my intention. I have that in my notes, on the\r\nother hand, which will do you more honour than the story of the gibbet\r\nand the Frog; I have gleaned, for your benefit, examples of prowess\r\nwhich will shed a new lustre upon your reputation.\r\n\r\nNo, my intention is not to belittle your renown. Besides, it is not\r\nthe business of impartial history to maintain a given thesis; it\r\nfollows facts. I wish simply to question you upon the power of logic\r\nattributed to you. Do you or do you not enjoy gleams of reason? Have\r\nyou within you the humble germ of human thought? That is the problem\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\nTo solve it we will not rely upon the accidents which good fortune may\r\nnow and again procure for us. We must employ the breeding-cage, which\r\nwill permit of assiduous visits, continuous enquiry and a variety of\r\nartifices. But how to stock the cage? The land of the olive-tree is\r\nnot rich in Necrophori. To my knowledge it possesses only a single\r\nspecies, _N. vestigator_, HERSCH.; and even this rival of the\r\ngrave-diggers of the north is pretty scarce. The discovery of three or\r\nfour in the spring was as much as my hunting-expeditions yielded in\r\nthe old days. This time, if I do not resort to the ruses of the\r\ntrapper, I shall obtain no more than that, whereas I stand in need of\r\nat least a dozen.\r\n\r\nThese ruses are very simple. To go in search of the sexton, who exists\r\nonly here and there in the country-side, would be nearly always a\r\nwaste of time; the favourable month, April, would be past before my\r\ncage was suitably stocked. To run after him is to trust too much to\r\naccident; so we will make him come to us by scattering in the orchard\r\nan abundant collection of dead Moles. To this carrion, ripened by the\r\nsun, the insect will not fail to hasten from the various points of the\r\nhorizon, so accomplished is he in detecting such a delicacy.\r\n\r\nI make an arrangement with a gardener in the neighbourhood, who, two\r\nor three times a week, makes up for the penury of my two acres of\r\nstony ground by providing me with vegetables raised in a better soil.\r\nI explain to him my urgent need of Moles in unlimited numbers.\r\nBattling daily with trap and spade against the importunate excavator\r\nwho uproots his crops, he is in a better position than any one to\r\nprocure for me what I regard for the moment as more precious than his\r\nbunches of asparagus or his white-heart cabbages.\r\n\r\nThe worthy man at first laughs at my request, being greatly surprised\r\nby the importance which I attribute to the abhorrent animal, the\r\n_Darboun_; but at last he consents, not without a suspicion at the\r\nback of his mind that I am going to make myself a gorgeous winter\r\nwaist-coat with the soft, velvety skins of the Moles. A thing like\r\nthat must be good for pains in the back. Very well. We settle the\r\nmatter. The essential thing is that the _Darbouns_ reach me.\r\n\r\nThey reach me punctually, by twos, by threes, by fours, packed in a\r\nfew cabbage-leaves, at the bottom of the gardener's basket. The\r\nexcellent fellow who lent himself with such good grace to my strange\r\nwishes will never guess how much comparative psychology will owe him!\r\nIn a few days I was the possessor of thirty Moles, which were\r\nscattered here and there, as they reached me, in bare spots of the\r\norchard, among the rosemary-bushes, the strawberry-trees and the\r\nlavender-beds.\r\n\r\nNow it only remained to wait and to examine, several times a day, the\r\nunder-side of my little corpses, a disgusting task which any one would\r\navoid whose veins were not filled with the sacred fire of enthusiasm.\r\nOnly little Paul, of all the household, lent me the aid of his nimble\r\nhand to seize the fugitives. I have already said that the entomologist\r\nneeds simplicity of mind. In this important business of the\r\nNecrophori, my assistants were a small boy and an illiterate.\r\n\r\nLittle Paul's visits alternating with mine, we had not long to wait.\r\nThe four winds of heaven bore forth in all directions the odour of the\r\ncarrion; and the undertakers hurried up, so that the experiments,\r\nbegun with four subjects, were continued with fourteen, a number not\r\nattained during the whole of my previous searches, which were\r\nunpremeditated and in which no bait was used as decoy. My trapper's\r\nruse was completely successful.\r\n\r\nBefore I report the results obtained in the cage, let us stop for a\r\nmoment to consider the normal conditions of the labours that fall to\r\nthe lot of the Necrophori. The Beetle does not select his head of\r\ngame, choosing one in proportion to his strength, as do the Hunting\r\nWasps; he accepts what chance offers. Among his finds some are small,\r\nsuch as the Shrew-mouse; some medium-sized, such as the Field-mouse;\r\nsome enormous, such as the Mole, the Sewer-rat and the Snake, any of\r\nwhich exceeds the digging-powers of a single sexton. In the majority\r\nof cases, transportation is impossible, so greatly disproportioned is\r\nthe burden to the motive-power. A slight displacement, caused by the\r\neffort of the insects' backs, is all that can possibly be effected.\r\n\r\nAmmophila and Cerceris,[8] Sphex and Pompilus excavate their burrows\r\nwherever they please; they carry their prey on the wing, or, if too\r\nheavy, drag it afoot. The Necrophorus knows no such facilities in his\r\ntask. Incapable of carting the monstrous corpse, no matter where\r\nencountered, he is forced to dig the grave where the body lies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Cf. _The Hunting Wasps_: chaps. i. to iii.--_Translator's\r\nNote_.]\r\n\r\nThis obligatory place of sepulture may be in stony soil or in shifting\r\nsand; it may occupy this or that bare spot, or some other where the\r\ngrass, especially the couch-grass, plunges into the ground its\r\ninextricable network of little cords. There is a great probability,\r\ntoo, that a bristle of stunted brambles may be supporting the body at\r\nsome inches above the soil. Slung by the labourer's spade, which has\r\njust broken his back, the Mole falls here, there, anywhere, at random;\r\nand where the body falls, no matter what the obstacles, provided that\r\nthey be not insurmountable, there the undertaker must utilize it.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of inhumation are capable of such variety as causes\r\nus already to foresee that the Necrophorus cannot employ fixed methods\r\nin performing his task. Exposed to fortuitous hazards, he must be able\r\nto modify his tactics within the limits of his modest discernment. To\r\nsaw, to break, to disentangle, to lift, to shake, to displace: these\r\nare so many means which are indispensable to the grave-digger in a\r\npredicament. Deprived of these resources, reduced to uniformity of\r\nprocedure, the insect would be incapable of pursuing its calling.\r\n\r\nWe see at once how imprudent it would be to draw conclusions from an\r\nisolated case in which rational co-ordination or premeditated\r\nintention might appear to play its part. Every instinctive action no\r\ndoubt has its motive; but does the animal in the first place judge\r\nwhether the action is opportune? Let us begin by a careful\r\nconsideration of the creature's labours; let us support each piece of\r\nevidence by others; and then we shall perhaps be able to answer the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, a word as to diet. A general scavenger, the\r\nBurying-beetle refuses no sort of cadaveric putrescence. All is good\r\nto his senses, feathered game or furry, provided that the burden do\r\nnot exceed his strength. He exploits the batrachian or the reptile\r\nwith no less animation. He accepts without hesitation extraordinary\r\nfinds, probably unknown to his race, as witness a certain Goldfish, a\r\nred Chinese Carp, whose body, placed in one of my cages, was forthwith\r\nconsidered an excellent tit-bit and buried according to the rules. Nor\r\nis butcher's meat despised. A mutton-cutlet, a strip of beef-steak, in\r\nthe right stage of maturity, disappeared beneath the soil, receiving\r\nthe same attentions as those lavished on the Mole or the Mouse. In\r\nshort, the Necrophorus has no exclusive preferences; anything putrid\r\nhe conveys underground.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of his industry, therefore, presents no sort of\r\ndifficulty. If one kind of game be lacking, some other, the first to\r\nhand, will very well replace it. Nor is there much trouble in fixing\r\nthe site of his industry. A capacious wire-gauze cover, resting on an\r\nearthen pan filled to the brim with fresh, heaped sand, is sufficient.\r\nTo obviate criminal attempts on the part of the Cats, whom the game\r\nwould not fail to tempt, the cage is installed in a closed\r\nglass-house, which in winter shelters the plants and in summer serves\r\nas an entomological laboratory.\r\n\r\nNow to work. The Mole lies in the centre of the enclosure. The soil,\r\neasily shifted and homogeneous, realizes the best conditions for\r\ncomfortable work. Four Necrophori, three males and a female, are there\r\nwith the body. They remain invisible, hidden beneath the carcase,\r\nwhich from time to time seems to return to life, shaken from end to\r\nend by the backs of the workers. An observer not in the secret would\r\nbe somewhat astonished to see the dead creature move. From time to\r\ntime, one of the sextons, almost always a male, comes out and walks\r\nround the animal, which he explores, probing its velvet coat. He\r\nhurriedly returns, appears again, once more investigates and creeps\r\nback under the corpse.\r\n\r\nThe tremors become more pronounced; the carcase oscillates, while a\r\ncushion of sand, pushed out from below, grows up all around it. The\r\nMole, by reason of his own weight and the efforts of the\r\ngrave-diggers, who are labouring at their task underneath, gradually\r\nsinks, for lack of support, into the undermined soil.\r\n\r\nPresently the sand which has been pushed out quivers under the thrust\r\nof the invisible miners, slips into the pit and covers the interred\r\nMole. It is a clandestine burial. The body seems to disappear of\r\nitself, as though engulfed by a fluid medium. For a long time yet,\r\nuntil the depth is regarded as sufficient, the body will continue to\r\ndescend.\r\n\r\nIt is, on the whole, a very simple operation. As the diggers below\r\ndeepen the cavity into which the corpse, shaken and tugged above,\r\nsinks without the direct intervention of the sextons, the grave fills\r\nof itself by the mere slipping of the soil. Stout shovels at the tips\r\nof their claws, powerful backs, capable of creating a little\r\nearthquake: the diggers need nothing more for the practice of their\r\nprofession. Let us add--for this is an essential point--the art of\r\ncontinually jerking the body, so as to pack it into a lesser volume\r\nand make it glide through difficult passages. We shall soon see that\r\nthis art plays a leading part in the industry of the Necrophori.\r\n\r\nAlthough he has disappeared, the Mole is still far from having reached\r\nhis destination. Let us leave the undertakers to finish their job.\r\nWhat they are now doing below ground is a continuation of what they\r\ndid on the surface and would teach us nothing new. We will wait for\r\ntwo or three days.\r\n\r\nThe moment has come. Let us inform ourselves of what is happening down\r\nthere. Let us visit the place of corruption. I shall never invite\r\nanybody to the exhumation. Of those about me, only little Paul has the\r\ncourage to assist me.\r\n\r\nThe Mole is a Mole no longer, but a greenish horror, putrid, hairless,\r\nshrunk into a sort of fat, greasy rasher. The thing must have\r\nundergone careful manipulation to be thus condensed into a small\r\nvolume, like a fowl in the hands of the cook, and, above all, to be so\r\ncompletely deprived of its furry coat. Is this culinary procedure\r\nundertaken in respect of the larvae, which might be incommoded by the\r\nfur? Or is it just a casual result, a mere loss of hair due to\r\nputridity? I am not certain. But it is always the case that these\r\nexhumations, from first to last, have revealed the furry game furless\r\nand the feathered game featherless, except for the pinion- and\r\ntail-feathers. Reptiles and fish, on the other hand, retain their\r\nscales.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the unrecognizable thing that was once a Mole. The\r\ntit-bit lies in a spacious crypt, with firm walls, a regular workshop,\r\nworthy of being the bake-house of a Copris. Except for the fur, which\r\nlies scattered about in flocks, it is intact. The grave-diggers have\r\nnot eaten into it: it is the patrimony of the sons, not the provision\r\nof the parents, who, to sustain themselves, levy at most a few\r\nmouthfuls of the ooze of putrid humours.\r\n\r\nBeside the dish which they are kneading and protecting are two\r\nNecrophori; a couple, no more. Four collaborated in the burial. What\r\nhas become of the other two, both males? I find them hidden in the\r\nsoil, at a distance, almost on the surface.\r\n\r\nThis observation is not an isolated one. Whenever I am present at a\r\nfuneral undertaken by a squad in which the males, zealous one and all,\r\npredominate, I find presently, when the burial is completed, only one\r\ncouple in the mortuary cellar. After lending their assistance, the\r\nrest have discreetly retired.\r\n\r\nThese grave-diggers, in truth, are remarkable fathers. They have\r\nnothing of the happy-go-lucky paternal carelessness that is the\r\ngeneral rule among insects, which pester the mother for a moment with\r\ntheir attentions and then leave her to care for the offspring! But\r\nthose who would be idlers in the other castes here labour valiantly,\r\nnow in the interest of their own family, now in that of another's,\r\nwithout distinction. If a couple is in difficulties, helpers arrive,\r\nattracted by the odour of carrion; anxious to serve a lady, they creep\r\nunder the body, work at it with back and claw, bury it and then go\r\ntheir ways, leaving the master and mistress of the house to their\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nFor some time longer these two manipulate the morsel in concert,\r\nstripping it of fur or feather, trussing it and allowing it to simmer\r\nto the grub's taste. When everything is in order, the couple go forth,\r\ndissolving their partnership; and each, following his fancy, begins\r\nagain elsewhere, even if only as a mere auxiliary.\r\n\r\nTwice and no oftener hitherto have I found the father preoccupied by\r\nthe future of his sons and labouring in order to leave them rich: it\r\nhappens with certain dung-workers and with the Necrophori, who bury\r\ndead bodies. Scavengers and undertakers both have exemplary morals.\r\nWho would look for virtue in such a quarter?\r\n\r\nWhat follows--the larval existence and the metamorphosis--is a\r\nsecondary and, for that matter, a familiar detail. It is a dry subject\r\nand I will deal with it briefly. At the end of May, I exhume a Brown\r\nRat, buried by the grave-diggers a fortnight earlier. Transformed into\r\na black, sticky mass, the horrible dish provides me with fifteen\r\nlarvae already, for the most part, of the normal size. A few adults,\r\nunquestionably connections of the brood, are also swarming amid the\r\nputrescence. The laying-time is over now and victuals are plentiful.\r\nHaving nothing else to do, the foster-parents have sat down to the\r\nfeast with the nurslings.\r\n\r\nThe undertakers are quick at rearing a family. It is at most a\r\nfortnight since the Rat was laid in the earth; and here already is a\r\nvigorous population on the verge of the metamorphosis. This precocity\r\namazes me. It would seem as though carrion liquefaction, deadly to any\r\nother stomach, were in this case a food productive of special energy,\r\nwhich stimulates the organism and accelerates its growth, so that the\r\nfare may be consumed before its approaching conversion into mould.\r\nLiving chemistry makes haste to outstrip the ultimate reactions of\r\nmineral chemistry.\r\n\r\nWhite, naked, blind, possessing the customary attributes of life spent\r\nin the dark, the larva, with its tapering outline, is slightly\r\nreminiscent of the Ground-beetles'. The mandibles are black and\r\npowerful and make excellent dissecting-scissors. The limbs are short,\r\nbut capable of a quick, toddling gait. The segments of the abdomen are\r\nclad on the upper surface in a narrow red plate, armed with four\r\nlittle spikes, whose office apparently is to furnish points of support\r\nwhen the larva quits the natal dwelling and dives into the soil, there\r\nto undergo the transformation. The thoracic segments are provided with\r\nwider plates, but unarmed.\r\n\r\nThe adults discovered in the company of their larval family, in this\r\nputrescence which was a Rat, are all abominably verminous. So shiny\r\nand neat in their attire, when at work under the first Moles of April,\r\nthe Necrophori, when June approaches, become odious to look upon. A\r\nlayer of parasites envelops them; insinuating itself into the joints,\r\nit forms an almost continuous crust. The insect presents a misshapen\r\nappearance under this overcoat of vermin, which my hair-pencil can\r\nhardly brush aside. Driven off the belly, the horde runs round the\r\nsufferer, perches on his back and refuses to let go.\r\n\r\nI recognize the Beetle's Gamasus, the Tick who so often soils the\r\nventral amethyst of our Geotrupes. No, life's prizes do not go to the\r\nuseful. Necrophori and Geotrupes devote themselves to the general\r\nhealth; and these two corporations, so interesting in their hygienic\r\nfunctions, so remarkable for their domestic morals, fall victims to\r\nthe vermin of poverty. Alas, of this discrepancy between the services\r\nrendered and the harshness of life there are many other examples\r\noutside the world of scavengers and undertakers!\r\n\r\nThe Burying-beetles display an exemplary domestic morality, but it\r\ndoes not continue till the end. In the first fortnight of June, the\r\nfamily being sufficiently provided, the sextons strike work and my\r\ncages are deserted on the surface, in spite of new arrivals of Mice\r\nand Sparrows. From time to time, some grave-digger leaves the subsoil\r\nand comes crawling languidly into the fresh air.\r\n\r\nAnother rather curious fact now attracts my attention. All those who\r\nclimb up from underground are maimed, with limbs amputated at the\r\njoints, some higher up, some lower down. I see one cripple who has\r\nonly one leg left entire. With this odd limb and the stumps of the\r\nothers, lamentably tattered, scaly with vermin, he rows, as it were,\r\nover the sheet of dust. A comrade emerges, better off for legs, who\r\nfinishes the invalid and cleans out his abdomen. Thus do my thirteen\r\nremaining Necrophori end their days, half-devoured by their\r\ncompanions, or at least shorn of several limbs. The pacific relations\r\nof the outset are succeeded by cannibalism.\r\n\r\nHistory tells us that certain peoples, the Massagetae and others, used\r\nto kill off their old men to save them from senile misery. The fatal\r\nblow on the hoary skull was in their eyes an act of filial piety. The\r\nNecrophori have their share of these ancient barbarities. Full of days\r\nand henceforth useless, dragging out a weary existence, they mutually\r\nexterminate one another. Why prolong the agony of the impotent and the\r\nimbecile?\r\n\r\nThe Massagetae might plead, as an excuse for their atrocious custom, a\r\ndearth of provisions, which is an evil counsellor; not so the\r\nNecrophori, for, thanks to my generosity, victuals are more than\r\nplentiful, both beneath the soil and on the surface. Famine plays no\r\npart in this slaughter. What we see is an aberration due to\r\nexhaustion, the morbid fury of a life on the point of extinction. As\r\nis generally the case, work bestows a peaceable disposition on the\r\ngrave-digger, while inaction inspires him with perverted tastes.\r\nHaving nothing left to do, he breaks his kinsman's limbs and eats him\r\nup, heedless of being maimed or eaten himself. It is the final\r\ndeliverance of verminous old age.\r\n\r\nThis murderous frenzy, breaking out late in life, is not peculiar to\r\nthe Necrophorus. I have described elsewhere the perversity of the\r\nOsmia, so placid in the beginning. Feeling her ovaries exhausted, she\r\nsmashes her neighbours' cells and even her own; she scatters the dusty\r\nhoney, rips open the egg, eats it. The Mantis devours the lovers who\r\nhave played their parts; the mother Decticus willingly nibbles a thigh\r\nof her decrepit husband; the merry Crickets, once the eggs are laid in\r\nthe ground, indulge in tragic domestic quarrels and with not the least\r\ncompunction slash open one another's bellies. When the cares of the\r\nfamily are finished, the joys of life are finished likewise. The\r\ninsect then sometimes becomes depraved; and its disordered mechanism\r\nends in aberrations.\r\n\r\nThe larva has nothing striking to show in the way of industry. When it\r\nhas fattened to the desired extent, it leaves the charnel-house of the\r\nnatal crypt and descends into the earth, far from the putrefaction.\r\nHere, working with its legs and its dorsal armour, it presses back the\r\nsand around it and makes itself a close cabin wherein to rest for the\r\nmetamorphosis. When the lodge is ready and the torpor of the\r\napproaching moult arrives, it lies inert; but, at the least alarm, it\r\ncomes to life and turns round on its axis.\r\n\r\nEven so do several nymphs spin round and round when disturbed, notably\r\nthat of _AEgosomus scabricornis_ which I have now before my eyes in\r\nJuly. It is always a fresh surprise to see these mummies suddenly\r\nthrow off their immobility and gyrate on their own axis with a\r\nmechanism whose secret deserves to be fathomed. The science of\r\nrational mechanics might find something here to whet its finest\r\ntheories upon. The strength and litheness of a clown cannot compare\r\nwith those of this budding flesh, this hardly coagulated glair.\r\n\r\nOnce isolated in its cell, the larva of the Necrophorus becomes a\r\nnymph in ten days or so. I lack the evidence furnished by direct\r\nobservation, but the story is completed of itself. The Necrophorus\r\nmust assume the adult form in the course of the summer; like the\r\nDung-beetle, he must enjoy in the autumn a few days of revelry free\r\nfrom family cares. Then, when the cold weather draws near, he goes to\r\nearth in his winter quarters, whence he emerges as soon as spring\r\narrives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\nTHE BURYING-BEETLES: EXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us come to the feats of reason which have earned for the\r\nNecrophorus the best part of his fame and, to begin with, submit the\r\ncase related by Clairville, that of the too hard soil and the call for\r\nassistance, to the test of experiment.\r\n\r\nWith this object I pave the centre of the space beneath the cover,\r\nflush with the soil, with a brick, which I sprinkle with a thin layer\r\nof sand. This will be the soil that cannot be dug. All around it, for\r\nsome distance and on the same level, lies the loose soil, which is\r\neasy to delve.\r\n\r\nIn order to approach the conditions of the anecdote, I must have a\r\nMouse; with a Mole, a heavy mass, the removal would perhaps present\r\ntoo much difficulty. To obtain one, I place my friends and neighbours\r\nunder requisition; they laugh at my whim but none the less proffer\r\ntheir traps. Yet, the moment a very common thing is needed, it becomes\r\nrare. Defying decency in his speech, after the manner of his\r\nancestors' Latin, the Provencal says, but even more crudely than in my\r\ntranslation:\r\n\r\n\"If you look for dung, the Donkeys become constipated!\"\r\n\r\nAt last I possess the Mouse of my dreams! She comes to me from that\r\nrefuge, furnished with a truss of straw, in which official charity\r\ngrants a day's hospitality to the pauper wandering over the face of\r\nthe fertile earth, from that municipal hostel whence one inevitably\r\nissues covered with Lice. O Reaumur,[1] who used to invite\r\nmarchionesses to see your caterpillars change their skins, what would\r\nyou have said of a future disciple conversant with such squalor as\r\nthis? Perhaps it is well that we should not be ignorant of it, so that\r\nwe may have compassion with that of the beast.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Rene Antoine Ferchault de Reaumur (1683-1757), the\r\ninventor of the Reaumur thermometer and author of _Memoires pour\r\nservir a l'histoire naturelle des insectes_\r\n(1734-1742).--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThe Mouse so greatly desired is mine. I place her upon the centre of\r\nthe brick. The grave-diggers under the wire cover are now seven in\r\nnumber, including three females. All have gone to earth; some are\r\ninactive, close to the surface; the rest are busy in their crypts. The\r\npresence of the fresh corpse is soon perceived. About seven o'clock in\r\nthe morning, three Necrophori come hurrying up, two males and a\r\nfemale. They slip under the Mouse, who moves in jerks, a sign of the\r\nefforts of the burying-party. An attempt is made to dig into the layer\r\nof sand which hides the brick, so that a bank of rubbish accumulates\r\nround the body.\r\n\r\nFor a couple of hours the jerks continue without results. I profit by\r\nthe circumstance to learn the manner in which the work is performed.\r\nThe bare brick allows me to see what the excavated soil would conceal\r\nfrom me. When it is necessary to move the body, the Beetle turns over;\r\nwith his six claws he grips the hair of the dead animal, props himself\r\nupon his back and pushes, using his forehead and the tip of his\r\nabdomen as a lever. When he wants to dig, he resumes the normal\r\nposition. So, turn and turn about, the sexton strives, now with his\r\nlegs in the air, when it is a question of shifting the body or\r\ndragging it lower down; now with his feet on the ground, when it is\r\nnecessary to enlarge the grave.\r\n\r\nThe point at which the Mouse lies is finally recognized as\r\nunassailable. A male appears in the open. He explores the corpse, goes\r\nround it, scratches a little at random. He goes back; and immediately\r\nthe dead body rocks. Is he advising his collaborators of what he has\r\ndiscovered? Is he arranging the work with a view to their establishing\r\nthemselves elsewhere, on propitious soil?\r\n\r\nThe facts are far from confirming this idea. When he shakes the body,\r\nthe others imitate him and push, but without combining their efforts\r\nin a given direction, for, after advancing a little towards the edge\r\nof the brick, the burden goes back again, returning to the point of\r\ndeparture. In the absence of a concerted understanding, their efforts\r\nof leverage are wasted. Nearly three hours are occupied by\r\noscillations which mutually annul one another. The Mouse does not\r\ncross the little sand-hill heaped about her by the rakes of the\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nFor the second time, a male appears and makes a round of exploration.\r\nA boring is effected in loose earth, close beside the brick. This is a\r\ntrial excavation, to learn the nature of the soil, a narrow well, of\r\nno great depth, into which the insect plunges to half its length. The\r\nwell-sinker returns to the other workers, who arch their backs, and\r\nthe load progresses a finger's-breadth towards the point recognized as\r\nfavourable. Have we done the trick this time? No, for after a while\r\nthe Mouse recoils. There is no progress towards a solution of the\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nNow two males come out in search of information, each of his own\r\naccord. Instead of stopping at the point already sounded, a point most\r\njudiciously chosen, it seemed, on account of its proximity, which\r\nwould save laborious carting, they precipitately scour the whole area\r\nof the cage, trying the soil on this side and on that and ploughing\r\nsuperficial furrows in it. They get as far from the brick as the\r\nlimits of the enclosure permit.\r\n\r\nThey dig, by preference, against the base of the cover; here they make\r\nseveral borings, without any reason, so far as I can see, the bed of\r\nsoil being everywhere equally assailable away from the brick; the\r\nfirst point sounded is abandoned for a second, which is rejected in\r\nits turn. A third and fourth are tried; then another. At the sixth\r\npoint the choice is made. In all these cases the excavation is by no\r\nmeans a grave destined to receive the Mouse, but a mere trial boring,\r\nof inconsiderable depth and of the diameter of the digger's body.\r\n\r\nBack again to the Mouse, who suddenly shakes, swings, advances,\r\nrecoils, first in one direction, then in another, until in the end the\r\nhillock of sand is crossed. Now we are free of the brick and on\r\nexcellent soil. Little by little the load advances. This is no cartage\r\nby a team hauling in the open, but a jerky removal, the work of\r\ninvisible levers. The body seems to shift of its own accord.\r\n\r\nThis time, after all those hesitations, the efforts are concerted; at\r\nleast, the load reaches the region sounded far more rapidly than I\r\nexpected. Then begins the burial, according to the usual method. It is\r\none o'clock. It has taken the Necrophori halfway round the clock to\r\nascertain the condition of the locality and to displace the Mouse.\r\n\r\nIn this experiment it appears, in the first place, that the males play\r\na major part in the affairs of the household. Better-equipped,\r\nperhaps, than their mates, they make investigations when a difficulty\r\noccurs; they inspect the soil, recognize whence the check arises and\r\nchoose the spot at which the grave shall be dug. In the lengthy\r\nexperiment of the brick, the two males alone explored the surroundings\r\nand set to work to solve the difficulty. Trusting her assistants, the\r\nfemale, motionless beneath the Mouse, awaited the result of their\r\nenquiries. The tests which are to follow will confirm the merits of\r\nthese valiant auxiliaries.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the points where the Mouse lies being recognized\r\nas presenting an insurmountable resistance, there is no grave dug in\r\nadvance, a little farther off, in the loose soil. All the attempts are\r\nlimited, I repeat, to shallow soundings, which inform the insect of\r\nthe possibility of inhumation.\r\n\r\nIt is absolute nonsense to speak of their first preparing the grave to\r\nwhich the body will afterwards be carted. In order to excavate the\r\nsoil, our sextons have to feel the weight of their dead upon their\r\nbacks. They work only when stimulated by the contact of its fur.\r\nNever, never in this world, do they venture to dig a grave unless the\r\nbody to be buried already occupies the site of the cavity. This is\r\nabsolutely confirmed by my two months and more of daily observations.\r\n\r\nThe rest of Clairville's anecdote bears examination no better. We are\r\ntold that the Necrophorus in difficulties goes in search of assistance\r\nand returns with companions who assist him to bury the Mouse. This, in\r\nanother form, is the edifying story of the Sacred Beetle whose pellet\r\nhas rolled into a rut. Powerless to withdraw his booty from the abyss,\r\nthe wily Dung-beetle summons three or four of his neighbours, who\r\nkindly pull out the pellet and return to their labours when the work\r\nof salvage is done.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For the confutation of this theory, cf. _The Sacred\r\nBeetle and Others_: chap. i.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThe ill-interpreted exploit of the thieving pill-roller sets me on my\r\nguard against that of the undertaker. Shall I be too particular if I\r\nask what precautions the observer took to recognize the owner of the\r\nMouse on his return, when he reappears, as we are told, with four\r\nassistants? What sign denotes that one of the five who was able, in so\r\nrational a manner, to call for help? Can we even be sure that the one\r\nto disappear returns and forms one of the band? There is nothing to\r\ntell us so; and this was the essential point which a sterling observer\r\nwas bound not to neglect. Were they not rather five chance Necrophori\r\nwho, guided by the smell, without any previous understanding, hastened\r\nto the abandoned Mouse to exploit her on their own account? I incline\r\nto this opinion, the likeliest of all in the absence of exact\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nProbability becomes certainty if we check the fact by experiment. The\r\ntest with the brick already tells us something. For six hours my three\r\nspecimens exhausted themselves in efforts before they succeeded in\r\nremoving their booty and placing it on practicable soil. In this long\r\nand heavy job, helpful neighbours would have been most welcome. Four\r\nother Necrophori, buried here and there under a little sand, comrades\r\nand acquaintances, fellow-workers of the day before, were occupying\r\nthe same cage; and not one of the busy ones thought of calling on them\r\nto assist. Despite their extreme embarrassment, the owners of the\r\nMouse accomplished their task to the end, without the least help,\r\nthough this could have been so easily requisitioned.\r\n\r\nBeing three, one might say, they deemed themselves strong enough; they\r\nneeded no one else to lend them a hand. The objection does not hold\r\ngood. On many occasions and under conditions even more difficult than\r\nthose presented by a hard soil, I have again and again seen isolated\r\nNecrophori wearing themselves out against my artifices; yet not once\r\ndid they leave their workshop to recruit helpers. Collaborators, it is\r\ntrue, often arrive, but they are summoned by their sense of smell, not\r\nby the first occupant. They are fortuitous helpers; they are never\r\ncalled in. They are received without strife but also without\r\ngratitude. They are not summoned; they are tolerated.\r\n\r\nIn the glazed shelter where I keep the cage I happened to catch one of\r\nthese chance assistants in the act. Passing that way in the night and\r\nscenting dead flesh, he had entered where none of his kind had yet\r\npenetrated of his own accord. I surprised him on the dome of the\r\ncover. If the wire had not prevented him, he would have set to work\r\nincontinently, in company with the rest. Had my captives invited this\r\none? Assuredly not. Heedless of others' efforts, he hastened up,\r\nattracted by the odour of the Mole. So it was with those whose\r\nobliging assistance is extolled. I repeat, in respect of their\r\nimaginary prowess, what I have said elsewhere of the Sacred Beetle's:\r\nit is a child's story, worthy to rank with any fairytale for the\r\namusement of the simple.\r\n\r\nA hard soil, necessitating the removal of the body, is not the only\r\ndifficulty with which the Necrophori are acquainted. Frequently,\r\nperhaps more often than not, the ground is covered with grass, above\r\nall with couch-grass, whose tenacious rootlets form an inextricable\r\nnetwork below the surface. To dig in the interstices is possible, but\r\nto drag the dead animal through them is another matter: the meshes of\r\nthe net are too close to give it passage. Will the grave-digger find\r\nhimself helpless against such an obstacle, which must be an extremely\r\ncommon one? That could not be.\r\n\r\nExposed to this or that habitual impediment in the exercise of its\r\ncalling, the animal is always equipped accordingly; otherwise its\r\nprofession would be impracticable. No end is attained without the\r\nnecessary means and aptitudes. Besides that of the excavator, the\r\nNecrophorus certainly possesses another art: the art of breaking the\r\ncables, the roots, the stolons, the slender rhizomes which check the\r\nbody's descent into the grave. To the work of the shovel and the pick\r\nmust be added that of the shears. All this is perfectly logical and\r\nmay be clearly foreseen. Nevertheless, let us call in experiment, the\r\nbest of witnesses.\r\n\r\nI borrow from the kitchen-range an iron trivet whose legs will supply\r\na solid foundation for the engine which I am devising. This is a\r\ncoarse network made of strips of raffia, a fairly accurate imitation\r\nof that of the couch-grass. The very irregular meshes are nowhere wide\r\nenough to admit of the passage of the creature to be buried, which\r\nthis time is a Mole. The machine is planted by its three feet in the\r\nsoil of the cage, level with the surface. A little sand conceals the\r\nropes. The Mole is placed in the centre; and my bands of sextons are\r\nlet loose upon the body.\r\n\r\nThe burial is performed without a hitch in the course of an afternoon.\r\nThe raffia hammock, almost the equivalent of the natural network of\r\nthe couch-grass, scarcely disturbs the burying-process. Matters do not\r\nproceed quite so quickly; and that is all. No attempt is made to shift\r\nthe Mole, who sinks into the ground where he lies. When the operation\r\nis finished, I remove the trivet. The network is broken at the spot\r\nwhere the corpse was lying. A few strips have been gnawed through; a\r\nsmall number, only as many as were strictly necessary to permit the\r\npassage of the body.\r\n\r\nWell done, my undertakers! I expected no less of your skill and tact.\r\nYou foiled the experimenter's wiles by employing the resources which\r\nyou use against natural obstacles. With mandibles for shears, you\r\npatiently cut my strings as you would have gnawed the threads of the\r\ngrass-roots. This is meritorious, if not deserving of exceptional\r\nglorification. The shallowest of the insects that work in earth would\r\nhave done as much if subjected to similar conditions.\r\n\r\nLet us ascend a stage in the series of difficulties. The Mole is now\r\nfixed by a strap of raffia fore and aft to a light horizontal\r\ncross-bar resting on two firmly-planted forks. It is like a joint of\r\nvenison on the spit, eccentrically fastened. The dead animal touches\r\nthe ground throughout the length of its body.\r\n\r\nThe Necrophori disappear under the corpse and, feeling the contact of\r\nits fur, begin to dig. The grave grows deeper and an empty space\r\nappears; but the coveted object does not descend, retained as it is by\r\nthe cross-bar which the two forks keep in place. The digging slackens,\r\nthe hesitations become prolonged.\r\n\r\nHowever, one of the grave-diggers climbs to the surface, wanders over\r\nthe Mole, inspects him and ends by perceiving the strap at the back.\r\nHe gnaws and ravels it tenaciously. I hear the click of the shears\r\nthat completes the rupture. Crack! The thing is done. Dragged down by\r\nhis own weight, the Mole sinks into the grave, but slantwise, with his\r\nhead still outside, kept in place by the second strap.\r\n\r\nThe Beetles proceed with the burial of the hinder part of the Mole;\r\nthey twitch and jerk it now in this direction, now in that. Nothing\r\ncomes of it; the thing refuses to give. A fresh sortie is made by one\r\nof them, to find out what is happening overhead. The second strap is\r\nperceived, is severed in turn; and henceforth the work goes on as well\r\nas could be wished.\r\n\r\nMy compliments, perspicacious cable-cutters! But I must not\r\nexaggerate. The Mole's straps were for you the little cords with which\r\nyou are so familiar in turfy soil. You broke them, as well as the\r\nhammock of the previous experiment, just as you sever with the blades\r\nof your shears any natural thread stretching across your catacombs. It\r\nis an indispensable trick of your trade. If you had had to learn it by\r\nexperience, to think it out before practising it, your race would have\r\ndisappeared, killed by the hesitations of its apprenticeship, for the\r\nspots prolific of Moles, Frogs, Lizards and other viands to your taste\r\nare usually covered with grass.\r\n\r\nYou are capable of much better things still; but, before setting forth\r\nthese, let us examine the case when the ground bristles with slender\r\nbrushwood, which holds the corpse at a short distance from the ground.\r\nWill the find thus hanging where it chances to fall remain unemployed?\r\nWill the Necrophori pass on, indifferent to the superb morsel which\r\nthey see and smell a few inches above their heads, or will they make\r\nit drop from its gibbet?\r\n\r\nGame does not abound to such a point that it can be despised if a few\r\nefforts will obtain it. Before I see the thing happen, I am persuaded\r\nthat it will fall, that the Necrophori, often confronted with the\r\ndifficulties of a body not lying on the soil, must possess the\r\ninstinct to shake it to the ground. The fortuitous support of a few\r\nbits of stubble, of a few interlaced twigs, so common in the fields,\r\ncannot put them off. The drop of the suspended body, if placed too\r\nhigh, must certainly form part of their instinctive methods. For the\r\nrest, let us watch them at work.\r\n\r\nI plant in the sand of the cage a meagre tuft of thyme. The shrub is\r\nat most some four inches in height. In the branches I place a Mouse,\r\nentangling the tail, the paws and the neck among the twigs to increase\r\nthe difficulty. The population of the cage now consists of fourteen\r\nNecrophori and will remain the same until the close of my\r\ninvestigations. Of course they do not all take part simultaneously in\r\nthe day's work: the majority remain underground, dozing or occupied in\r\nsetting their cellars in order. Sometimes only one, often two, three\r\nor four, rarely more, busy themselves with the corpse which I offer\r\nthem. To-day, two hasten to the Mouse, who is soon perceived overhead\r\non the tuft of thyme.\r\n\r\nThey gain the top of the plant by way of the trelliswork of the cage.\r\nHere are repeated, with increased hesitation, due to the inconvenient\r\nnature of the support, the tactics employed to remove the body when\r\nthe soil is unfavourable. The insect props itself against a branch,\r\nthrusting alternately with back and claws, jerking and shaking\r\nvigorously until the point whereat it is working is freed from its\r\nfetters. In one brief shift, by dint of heaving their backs, the two\r\ncollaborators extricate the body from the tangle. Yet another shake;\r\nand the Mouse is down. The burial follows.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing new in this experiment: the find has been treated\r\njust as though it lay on soil unsuitable for burial. The fall is the\r\nresult of an attempt to transport the load.\r\n\r\nThe time has come to set up the Frog's gibbet made famous by\r\nGleditsch. The batrachian is not indispensable; a Mole will serve as\r\nwell or even better. With a ligament of raffia I fix him, by his\r\nhind-legs, to a twig which I plant vertically in the ground, inserting\r\nit to no great depth. The creature hangs plumb against the gibbet, its\r\nhead and shoulders making ample contact with the soil.\r\n\r\nThe grave-diggers set to work beneath the part which lies along the\r\nground, at the very foot of the stake; they dig a funnel into which\r\nthe Mole's muzzle, head and neck sink little by little. The gibbet\r\nbecomes uprooted as they descend and ends by falling, dragged over by\r\nthe weight of its heavy burden. I am assisting at the spectacle of the\r\noverturned stake, one of the most astonishing feats of reason with\r\nwhich the insect has ever been credited.\r\n\r\nThis, for one who is considering the problem of instinct, is an\r\nexciting moment. But let us beware of forming conclusions just yet; we\r\nmight be in too great a hurry. Let us first ask ourselves whether the\r\nfall of the stake was intentional or accidental. Did the Necrophori\r\nlay it bare with the express purpose of making it fall? Or did they,\r\non the contrary, dig at its base solely in order to bury that part of\r\nthe Mole which lay on the ground? That is the question, which, for the\r\nrest, is very easy to answer.\r\n\r\nThe experiment is repeated; but this time the gibbet is slanting and\r\nthe Mole, hanging in a vertical position, touches the ground at a\r\ncouple of inches from the base of the apparatus. Under these\r\nconditions, absolutely no attempt is made to overthrow it. Not the\r\nleast scrape of a claw is delivered at the foot of the gibbet. The\r\nentire work of excavation is performed at a distance, under the body,\r\nwhose shoulders are lying on the ground. Here and here only a hole is\r\ndug to receive the front of the body, the part accessible to the\r\nsextons.\r\n\r\nA difference of an inch in the position of the suspended animal\r\ndestroys the famous legend. Even so, many a time, the most elementary\r\nsieve, handled with a little logic, is enough to winnow a confused\r\nmass of statements and to release the good grain of truth.\r\n\r\nYet another shake of this sieve. The gibbet is slanting or\r\nperpendicular, no matter which; but the Mole, fixed by his hind-legs\r\nto the top of the twig, does not touch the soil; he hangs a few\r\nfingers'-breadths from the ground, out of the sextons' reach.\r\n\r\nWhat will they do now? Will they scrape at the foot of the gibbet in\r\norder to overturn it? By no means; and the ingenuous observer who\r\nlooked for such tactics would be greatly disappointed. No attention is\r\npaid to the base of the support. It is not vouchsafed even a stroke of\r\nthe rake. Nothing is done to overturn it, nothing, absolutely nothing!\r\nIt is by other methods that the Burying-beetles obtain the Mole.\r\n\r\nThese decisive experiments, repeated under many different forms, prove\r\nthat never, never in this world, do the Necrophori dig, or even give a\r\nsuperficial scrape, at the foot of the gallows, unless the hanging\r\nbody touch the ground at that point. And, in the latter case, if the\r\ntwig should happen to fall, this is in no way an intentional result,\r\nbut a mere fortuitous effect of the burial already commenced.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, did the man with the Frog, of whom Gleditsch tells us,\r\nreally see? If his stick was overturned, the body placed to dry beyond\r\nthe assaults of the Necrophori must certainly have touched the soil: a\r\nstrange precaution against robbers and damp! We may well attribute\r\nmore foresight to the preparer of dried Frogs and allow him to hang\r\nhis animal a few inches off the ground. In that case, as all my\r\nexperiments emphatically declare, the fall of the stake undermined by\r\nthe sextons is a pure matter of imagination.\r\n\r\nYet another of the fine arguments in favour of the reasoning-power of\r\ninsects flies from the light of investigation and founders in the\r\nslough of error! I wonder at your simple faith, O masters who take\r\nseriously the statements of chance-met observers, richer in\r\nimagination than in veracity; I wonder at your credulous zeal, when,\r\nwithout criticism, you build up your theories on such absurdities!\r\n\r\nLet us continue. The stake is henceforth planted perpendicularly, but\r\nthe body hanging on it does not reach the base: a condition enough to\r\nensure that there will never be any digging at this point. I make use\r\nof a Mouse, who, by reason of her light weight, will lend herself\r\nbetter to the insect's manoeuvres. The dead animal is fixed by the\r\nhind-legs to the top of the apparatus with a raffia strap. It hangs\r\nplumb, touching the stick.\r\n\r\nSoon two Necrophori have discovered the morsel. They climb the greased\r\npole; they explore the prize, poking their foreheads into its fur. It\r\nis recognized as an excellent find. To work, therefore. Here we have\r\nagain, but under more difficult conditions, the tactics employed when\r\nit was necessary to displace the unfavourably situated body: the two\r\ncollaborators slip between the Mouse and the stake and, taking a grip\r\nof the twig and exerting a leverage with their backs, they jerk and\r\nshake the corpse, which sways, twirls about, swings away from the\r\nstake and swings back again. All the morning is passed in vain\r\nattempts, interrupted by explorations on the animal's body.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, the cause of the check is at last recognized; not\r\nvery clearly, for the two obstinate gallow-robbers first attack the\r\nMouse's hind-legs, a little way below the strap. They strip them bare,\r\nflay them and cut away the flesh about the foot. They have reached the\r\nbone, when one of them finds the string of raffia beneath his\r\nmandibles. This, to him, is a familiar thing, representing the\r\ngrass-thread so frequent in burials in turfy soil. Tenaciously the\r\nshears gnaw at the bond; the fibrous fetter is broken; and the Mouse\r\nfalls, to be buried soon after.\r\n\r\nIf it stood alone, this breaking of the suspending tie would be a\r\nmagnificent performance; but considered in connection with the sum of\r\nthe Beetle's customary labours it loses any far-reaching significance.\r\nBefore attacking the strap, which was not concealed in any way, the\r\ninsect exerted itself for a whole morning in shaking the body, its\r\nusual method. In the end, finding the cord, it broke it, as it would\r\nhave broken a thread of couch-grass encountered underground.\r\n\r\nUnder the conditions devised for the Beetle, the use of the shears is\r\nthe indispensable complement of the use of the shovel; and the modicum\r\nof discernment at his disposal is enough to inform him when it will be\r\nwell to employ the clippers. He cuts what embarrasses him, with no\r\nmore exercise of reason than he displays when lowering his dead Mouse\r\nunderground. So little does he grasp the relation of cause and effect\r\nthat he tries to break the bone of the leg before biting the raffia\r\nwhich is knotted close beside him. The difficult task is attempted\r\nbefore the extremely easy one.\r\n\r\nDifficult, yes, but not impossible, provided that the Mouse be young.\r\nI begin over again with a strip of iron wire, on which the insect's\r\nshears cannot get a grip, and a tender Mousekin, half the size of an\r\nadult. This time a tibia is gnawed through, sawed in two by the\r\nBeetle's mandibles, near the spring of the heel. The detached leg\r\nleaves plenty of space for the other, which readily slips from the\r\nmetal band; and the little corpse falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nBut, if the bone be too hard, if the prize suspended be a Mole, an\r\nadult Mouse or a Sparrow, the wire ligament opposes an insurmountable\r\nobstacle to the attempts of the Necrophori, who, for nearly a week,\r\nwork at the hanging body, partly stripping it of fur or feather and\r\ndishevelling it until it forms a lamentable object, and at last\r\nabandon it when desiccation sets in. And yet a last resource remained,\r\none as rational as infallible: to overthrow the stake. Of course, not\r\none dreams of doing so.\r\n\r\nFor the last time let us change our artifices. The top of the gibbet\r\nconsists of a little fork, with the prongs widely opened and measuring\r\nbarely two-fifths of an inch in length. With a thread of hemp, less\r\neasily attacked than a strip of raffia, I bind the hind-legs of an\r\nadult Mouse together, a little above the heels; and I slip one of the\r\nprongs in between. To bring the thing down one has only to slide it a\r\nlittle way upwards; it is like a young Rabbit hanging in the window of\r\na poulterer's shop.\r\n\r\nFive Necrophori come to inspect what I have prepared. After much\r\nfutile shaking, the tibiae are attacked. This, it seems, is the method\r\nusually employed when the corpse is caught by one of its limbs in some\r\nnarrow fork of a low-growing plant. While trying to saw through the\r\nbone--a heavy job this time--one of the workers slips between the\r\nshackled legs; in this position, he feels the furry touch of the Mouse\r\nagainst his chine. No more is needed to arouse his propensity to\r\nthrust with his back. With a few heaves of the lever the thing is\r\ndone: the Mouse rises a little, slides over the supporting peg and\r\nfalls to the ground.\r\n\r\nIs this manoeuvre really thought out? Has the insect indeed perceived,\r\nby the light of a flash of reason, that to make the morsel fall it was\r\nnecessary to unhook it by sliding it along the peg? Has it actually\r\nperceived the mechanism of the hanging? I know some persons--indeed, I\r\nknow many--who, in the presence of this magnificent result, would be\r\nsatisfied without further investigation.\r\n\r\nMore difficult to convince, I modify the experiment before drawing a\r\nconclusion. I suspect that the Necrophorus, without in any way\r\nforeseeing the consequences of his action, heaved his back merely\r\nbecause he felt the animal's legs above him. With the system of\r\nsuspension adopted, the push of the back, employed in all cases of\r\ndifficulty, was brought to bear first upon the point of support; and\r\nthe fall resulted from this happy coincidence. That point, which has\r\nto be slipped along the peg in order to unhook the object, ought\r\nreally to be placed at a short distance from the Mouse, so that the\r\nNecrophori may no longer feel her directly on their backs when they\r\npush.\r\n\r\nA wire binds together now the claws of a Sparrow, now the heels of a\r\nMouse and is bent, three-quarters of an inch farther away, into a\r\nlittle ring, which slips very loosely over one of the prongs of the\r\nfork, a short, almost horizontal prong. The least push of this ring is\r\nenough to bring the hanging body to the ground; and because it stands\r\nout it lends itself excellently to the insect's methods. In short, the\r\narrangement is the same as just now, with this difference, that the\r\npoint of support is at a short distance from the animal hung up.\r\n\r\nMy trick, simple though it be, is quite successful. For a long time\r\nthe body is repeatedly shaken, but in vain; the tibiae, the hard claws\r\nrefuse to yield to the patient saw. Sparrows and Mice grow dry and\r\nshrivel, unused, upon the gallows. My Necrophori, some sooner, some\r\nlater, abandon the insoluble mechanical problem: to push, ever so\r\nlittle, the movable support and so to unhook the coveted carcase.\r\n\r\nCurious reasoners, in faith! If, just now, they had a lucid idea of\r\nthe mutual relations between the tied legs and the suspending peg; if\r\nthey made the Mouse fall by a reasoned manoeuvre, whence comes it that\r\nthe present artifice, no less simple than the first, is to them an\r\ninsurmountable obstacle? For days and days they work on the body,\r\nexamining it from head to foot, without noticing the movable support,\r\nthe cause of their mishap. In vain I prolong my watch; I never see a\r\nsingle one of them push the support with his foot or butt it with his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nTheir defeat is not due to lack of strength. Like the Geotrupes, they\r\nare vigorous excavators. When you grasp them firmly in your hand, they\r\nslip into the interstices of the fingers and plough up your skin so as\r\nto make you quickly loose your hold. With his head, a powerful\r\nploughshare, the Beetle might very easily push the ring off its short\r\nsupport. He is not able to do so, because he does not think of it; he\r\ndoes not think of it, because he is devoid of the faculty attributed\r\nto him, in order to support their theories, by the dangerous\r\ngenerosity of the evolutionists.\r\n\r\nDivine reason, sun of the intellect, what a clumsy slap in thy august\r\ncountenance, when the glorifiers of the animal degrade thee with such\r\ndenseness!\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the mental obscurity of the Necrophori under\r\nanother aspect. My captives are not so satisfied with their sumptuous\r\nlodging that they do not seek to escape, especially when there is a\r\ndearth of labour, that sovran consoler of the afflicted, man or beast.\r\nInternment within the wire cover palls upon them. So, when the Mole is\r\nburied and everything in order in the cellar, they stray uneasily over\r\nthe trellised dome; they clamber up, come down, go up again and take\r\nto flight, a flight which instantly becomes a fall, owing to collision\r\nwith the wire grating. They pick themselves up and begin all over\r\nagain. The sky is splendid; the weather is hot, calm and propitious\r\nfor those in search of the Lizard crushed beside the footpath. Perhaps\r\nthe effluvia of the gamy tit-bit have reached them from afar,\r\nimperceptible to any other sense than that of the grave-diggers. My\r\nNecrophori therefore would be glad to get away.\r\n\r\nCan they? Nothing would be easier, if a glimmer of reason were to aid\r\nthem. Through the trelliswork, over which they have so often strayed,\r\nthey have seen, outside, the free soil, the promised land which they\r\nwant to reach. A hundred times if once have they dug at the foot of\r\nthe rampart. There, in vertical wells, they take up their station,\r\ndrowsing whole days on end while unemployed. If I give them a fresh\r\nMole, they emerge from their retreat by the entrance-corridor and come\r\nto hide themselves beneath the belly of the beast. The burial over,\r\nthey return, one here, one there, to the confines of the enclosure and\r\ndisappear underground.\r\n\r\nWell, in two and a half months of captivity, despite long stays at the\r\nbase of the trellis, at a depth of three-quarters of an inch beneath\r\nthe surface, it is rare indeed for a Necrophorus to succeed in\r\ncircumventing the obstacle, in prolonging his excavation beneath the\r\nbarrier, in digging an elbow and bringing it out on the other side, a\r\ntrifling task for these vigorous creatures. Of fourteen only one\r\nsucceeds in escaping.\r\n\r\nA chance deliverance and not premeditated; for, if the happy event had\r\nbeen the result of a mental combination, the other prisoners,\r\npractically his equals in powers of perception, would all, from first\r\nto last, have discovered by rational means the elbowed path leading to\r\nthe outer world; and the cage would promptly be deserted. The failure\r\nof the great majority proves that the single fugitive was simply\r\ndigging at random. Circumstances favoured him; and that is all. We\r\nmust not put it to his credit that he succeeded where all the others\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nWe must also beware of attributing to the Necrophori a duller\r\nunderstanding than is usual in insect psychology. I find the ineptness\r\nof the undertaker in all the Beetles reared under the wire cover, on\r\nthe bed of sand into which the rim of the dome sinks a little way.\r\nWith very rare exceptions, fortuitous accidents, not one thinks of\r\ncircumventing the barrier by way of the base; not one manages to get\r\noutside by means of a slanting tunnel, not even though he be a miner\r\nby profession, as are the Dung-beetles _par excellence_. Captives\r\nunder the wire dome and anxious to escape, Sacred Beetles, Geotrupes,\r\nCopres, Gymnopleuri,[3] Sisyphi,[4] all see about them the free space,\r\nthe joys of the open sunlight; and not one thinks of going round under\r\nthe rampart, which would present no difficulty to their pickaxes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Cf. _The Sacred Beetle and Others_: chap.\r\nvii.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Cf. _idem_: chap. xv.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nEven in the higher ranks of animality, examples of similar mental\r\nobfuscation are not lacking. Audubon[5] tells us how, in his days,\r\nwild Turkeys were caught in North America. In a clearing known to be\r\nfrequented by these birds, a great cage was constructed with stakes\r\ndriven into the ground. In the centre of the enclosure opened a short\r\ntunnel, which dipped under the palisade and returned to the surface\r\noutside the cage by a gentle slope, which was open to the sky. The\r\ncentral opening, wide enough to give a bird free passage, occupied\r\nonly a portion of the enclosure, leaving around it, against the circle\r\nof stakes, a wide unbroken zone. A few handfuls of maize were\r\nscattered in the interior of the trap, as well as round about it, and\r\nin particular along the sloping path, which passed under a sort of\r\nbridge and led to the centre of the contrivance. In short, the\r\nTurkey-trap presented an ever-open door. The bird found it in order to\r\nenter, but did not think of looking for it in order to go out.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: John James Audubon (1780-1851), the noted American\r\nornithologist, of French descent, author of _Birds of America_\r\n(1827-1830) and _Ornithological Biography_ (1831-1839).--_Translator's\r\nNote_.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the famous American ornithologist, the Turkeys, lured by\r\nthe grains of maize, descended the insidious slope, entered the short\r\nunderground passage and beheld, at the end of it, plunder and the\r\nlight. A few steps farther and the gluttons emerged, one by one, from\r\nbeneath the bridge. They distributed themselves about the enclosure.\r\nThe maize was abundant; and the Turkeys' crops grew swollen.\r\n\r\nWhen all was gathered, the band wished to retreat, but not one of the\r\nprisoners paid any attention to the central hole by which he had\r\narrived. Gobbling uneasily, they passed again and again across the\r\nbridge whose arch was yawning beside them; they circled round against\r\nthe palisade, treading a hundred times in their own footprints; they\r\nthrust their necks, with their crimson wattles, through the bars; and\r\nthere, with their beaks in the open air, they fought and struggled\r\nuntil they were exhausted.\r\n\r\nRemember, O inept one, what happened but a little while ago; think of\r\nthe tunnel that led you hither! If that poor brain of yours contains\r\nan atom of ability, put two ideas together and remind yourself that\r\nthe passage by which you entered is there and open for your escape!\r\nYou will do nothing of the kind. The light, an irresistible\r\nattraction, holds you subjugated against the palisade; and the shadow\r\nof the yawning pit, which has but lately permitted you to enter and\r\nwill quite as readily permit you to go out, leaves you indifferent. To\r\nrecognize the use of this opening you would have to reflect a little,\r\nto recall the past; but this tiny retrospective calculation is beyond\r\nyour powers. So the trapper, returning a few days later, will find a\r\nrich booty, the entire flock imprisoned!\r\n\r\nOf poor intellectual repute, does the Turkey deserve his name for\r\nstupidity? He does not appear to be more limited than another. Audubon\r\ndepicts him as endowed with certain useful ruses, in particular when\r\nhe has to baffle the attacks of his nocturnal enemy, the Virginian\r\nOwl. As for his behaviour in the snare with the underground passage,\r\nany other bird, impassioned of the light, would do the same.\r\n\r\nUnder rather more difficult conditions, the Necrophorus repeats the\r\nineptness of the Turkey. When he wishes to return to the daylight,\r\nafter resting in a short burrow against the rim of the cover, the\r\nBeetle, seeing a little light filtering through the loose soil,\r\nreascends the entrance-well, incapable of telling himself that he has\r\nonly to prolong the tunnel as far in the opposite direction to reach\r\nthe outer world beyond the wall and gain his freedom. Here again is\r\none in whom we shall seek in vain for any sign of reflection. Like the\r\nrest, in spite of his legendary renown, he has no guide but the\r\nunconscious promptings of instinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\nTHE GIANT SCARITES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe military profession can hardly be said to favour the talents.\r\nConsider the Carabus, or Ground-beetle, that fiery warrior among the\r\ninsect people. What can he do? In the way of industry, nothing or next\r\nto nothing. Nevertheless the dull butcher is magnificent in his\r\nindescribably sumptuous jerkin. It has the refulgency of copper\r\npyrites, of gold, of Florentine bronze. While clad in black, he\r\nenriches his sombre costume with a vivid amethyst hem. On the\r\nwing-cases, which fit him like a cuirass, he wears little chains of\r\nalternate pins and bosses.\r\n\r\nOf a handsome and commanding figure, slender and pinched in at the\r\nwaist, the Carabus is the glory of our collections, but only for the\r\nsake of his appearance. He is a frenzied murderer; and that is all. We\r\nwill ask nothing more of him. The wisdom of antiquity represented\r\nHercules, the god of strength, with the head of an idiot. And indeed\r\nmerit is not great when limited to brute force. And this is the case\r\nwith the Carabus.\r\n\r\nTo see him so richly adorned, who would not wish to find him a fine\r\nsubject for investigation, one worthy of history, a subject such as\r\nhumbler natures provide with lavish generosity? From this ferocious\r\nransacker of entrails we expect nothing of the kind. His art is that\r\nof slaying.\r\n\r\nWe may without trouble observe him at his bandit's work. I rear him in\r\na large breeding-cage on a layer of fresh sand. A few potsherds\r\nscattered about the surface enable him to take shelter beneath the\r\nrocks; a tuft of grass planted in the centre makes a grove and\r\nenlivens the establishment.\r\n\r\nThree species compose the population: the common _Jardiniere_, or\r\nGolden Beetle, the usual inmate of our gardens; _Procrustes\r\ncoriaceus_, the sombre and powerful explorer of the grassy thickets at\r\nthe foot of walls; and the rare Purple Carabus, who trims the ebony of\r\nhis wing-cases with metallic violet. I feed them on Snails, after\r\npartly removing the shell.\r\n\r\nHidden at first promiscuously under the potsherds, the Carabi make a\r\nrush for the wretched Snail, who, in his despair, alternately puts out\r\nand withdraws his horns. Three of them at a time, then four, then five\r\nbegin by devouring the edge of his mantle, specked with chalky atoms.\r\nThis is the favourite morsel. With their mandibles, those stout\r\npincers, they lay hold of it through the froth; they tug at it, tear\r\noff a shred and retire to a distance to swallow it at their ease.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the legs, streaming with slime, pick up grains of sand and\r\nbecome covered with heavy gaiters, which are extremely cumbersome but\r\nto which the Beetle pays no attention. Heavy with mire, he staggers\r\nback to his prey and cuts off another morsel. He will think of\r\npolishing his boots presently. Others do not stir, but gorge\r\nthemselves on the spot, with the whole fore-part of their body\r\nimmersed in the froth. The feast lasts for hours on end. The guests do\r\nnot leave the joint until the distended belly lifts the roof of the\r\nwing-cases and uncovers the nudities of the stern.\r\n\r\nFonder of shady nooks, the Procrustes form a separate company. They\r\ndrag the Snail into their lair, under the shelter of a potsherd, and\r\nthere, peacefully and in common, dismember the mollusc. They love the\r\nSlug, as easier to cut up than the Snail, who is defended by his\r\nshell; they regard the Testacella,[1] who bears a chalky shell, shaped\r\nlike a Phrygian cap, right at the hinder end of her foot, as a\r\ndelicious tit-bit. The game has firmer flesh and is less nauseously\r\nslimy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Or Shell-bearing Slug, found along the shores of the\r\nMediterranean.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nTo feast gluttonously on a Snail whom I myself have rendered\r\ndefenseless by breaking her shell is nothing for a warrior to boast\r\nabout; but we shall soon see the Carabus display his daring. I offer a\r\nPine-chafer, in the pink of strength, to the Golden Beetle, whose\r\nappetite has been whetted by a few days' fasting. The victim is a\r\ncolossus beside the Golden Carabus; an Ox facing a Wolf.\r\n\r\nThe beast of prey prowls round the peaceful creature and selects its\r\nmoment. It rushes forward, recoils, hesitates and returns to the\r\ncharge. And lo, the giant is overthrown! Incontinently the other\r\ndevours him, ransacking his belly. If this had happened in a higher\r\norder of the animal world, it would make one's flesh creep to watch\r\nthe Carabus half immersed in the big Cockchafer and rooting out his\r\nentrails.\r\n\r\nI test the eviscerator with a more difficult quarry. This time the\r\nvictim is _Oryctes nasicornis_, the powerful Rhinoceros Beetle, an\r\ninvincible giant, one would think, under the shelter of his armour.\r\nBut the hunter knows the weak point of the horn-clad prey, the fine\r\nskin protected by the wing-cases. By means of attacks which the\r\nassailant renews as soon as they are repulsed by the assailed, the\r\nCarabus contrives to raise the cuirass slightly and to slip his head\r\nbeneath it. From the moment that the pincers have made a gash in the\r\nvulnerable skin, the Rhinoceros is lost. Soon there will be nothing\r\nleft of the colossus but a pitiful empty carcase.\r\n\r\nThose who wish for a more hideous conflict must apply to _Calosoma\r\nsycophanta_, the handsomest of our flesh-eating insects, the most\r\nmajestic in costume and size. This prince of Carabi is the butcher of\r\nthe caterpillars. He is not to be overawed even by the sturdiest of\r\nrumps.\r\n\r\nHis struggle with the huge caterpillar of the Great Peacock Moth[2] is\r\na thing to see once, not oftener: a single experience of such horrors\r\nis enough to disgust one. The contortions of the eviscerated insect,\r\nwhich, with a sudden heave of the loins, hurls the bandit in the air\r\nand lets him fall, belly uppermost, without managing to make him\r\nrelease his hold; the green entrails spilt quivering on the ground;\r\nthe tramping gait of the murderer, drunk with slaughter, slaking his\r\nthirst at the springs of a horrible wound: these are the main features\r\nof the combat. If entomology had no other scenes to show us, I should\r\nwithout the least regret turn my back upon my insects.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Cf. _The Life of the Caterpillar_: chap.\r\nxi.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nNext day, offer the sated Beetle a Green Grasshopper or a White-faced\r\nDecticus, serious adversaries both, armed with powerful lower jaws.\r\nWith these big-bellied creatures the slaughter will begin anew, as\r\neagerly as on the day before. It will be repeated later with the Pine-\r\nchafer and the Rhinoceros Beetle, accompanied by the usual atrocious\r\ntactics of the Carabi. Even better than these last does the Calosoma\r\nknow the weak point of the armoured Beetles, concealed beneath the\r\nwing-cases. And this will go on so long as we keep him provided with\r\nvictims, for this drinker of blood is never satiated.\r\n\r\nAcrid exhalations, the products of a fiery temperament, accompany this\r\nfrenzy for carnage. The Carabi elaborate caustic humours; the\r\nProcrustes squirts a jet of vinegar at any one who takes hold of him;\r\nthe Calosoma makes the fingers smell of mouldy drugs; certain Beetles,\r\nsuch as the Brachini,[3] understand explosives and singe the\r\naggressor's whiskers with a volley of musketry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Or Bombardier Beetles. When disturbed, they eject a fluid\r\nwhich volatilizes, on contact with the air, with a slight report.--\r\n_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nDistillers of corrosives, gunners throwing lyddite, bombers employing\r\ndynamite: what can all these violent creatures, so well equipped for\r\nbattle, do beyond committing slaughter? Nothing. We find no art, no\r\nindustry, not even in the larva, which practices the adult's trade and\r\nmeditates its crimes while wandering under the stones. Nevertheless it\r\nis to one of these dull-witted warriors that I am deliberately\r\nproposing to apply to-day, prompted by the wish to solve a certain\r\nquestion. Let me tell you what it is.\r\n\r\nYou have surprised this or that insect, motionless on a bough,\r\nblissfully basking in the sun. Your hand is raised, open, ready to\r\ndescend on it and seize it. Hardly have you made the movement when the\r\ninsect drops to the ground. It is a wearer of armoured wing-cases,\r\nslow to disengage the wings from their horny sheath, or perhaps an\r\nincomplete form, with no wing-surfaces. Incapable of sudden flight,\r\nthe surprised insect lets itself fall. You look for it in the grass,\r\noften in vain. If you do find it, it is lying on its back, with its\r\nlegs folded, without stirring.\r\n\r\nIt is shamming dead, people will tell you; it is pretending, in order\r\nto escape its enemy. Man is certainly unknown to it; we count for\r\nnothing in its little world. What does it care for our hunting,\r\nwhether we be children or scientists? It does not fear the collector\r\nwith his long pin; but it realizes danger in general; and it dreads\r\nits natural enemy, the insectivorous bird, which swallows it with a\r\nsingle snap. To outwit the assailant, it lies upon its back, draws up\r\nits legs and simulates death. The bird, or any other persecutor, will\r\ndespise it in this condition; and its life will be saved.\r\n\r\nThis, we are assured, is how the insect would reason if suddenly\r\nsurprised. The trick has long been famous. Once upon a time, two\r\nfriends, at the end of their resources, sold the skin of a Bear before\r\nthey had killed the brute. The encounter was unfortunate: they had to\r\ntake to their heels. One of them stumbled, fell, held his breath and\r\nshammed dead. The Bear came up, turned the man over and over, explored\r\nhim with his paw and his muzzle, sniffed at his face:\r\n\r\n\"He smells already,\" he said and, without more ado, turned away.\r\n\r\nThat Bear was a simpleton.\r\n\r\nThe bird would not be duped by this clumsy stratagem. In those happy\r\ndays when the discovery of a nest marked a red-letter day, I never saw\r\nmy Sparrows or Greenfinches refuse a Locust because he was not moving,\r\nor a Fly because she was dead. Any mouthful that does not kick is\r\neagerly accepted, provided that it be fresh and pleasant to the taste.\r\n\r\nIf the insect, therefore, relies on the appearance of death, it would\r\nseem to me to be very badly inspired. More wary than the Bear in the\r\nfable, the bird, with its perspicacious eye, will recognize the fraud\r\nin a moment and proceed to business. Besides, had the object really\r\nbeen a corpse, but still fresh, it would none the less have gobbled it\r\nup.\r\n\r\nMore insistent doubts occur to my mind when I consider the serious\r\nconsequences to which the insect's artfulness might lead. It shams\r\ndead, says the popular idiom, which recks little of weighing the value\r\nof its term; it simulates death, scientific language repeats, happy to\r\nfind some gleams of reason in the insect. What truth is there in this\r\nunanimous statement, which in the one case is too unreflecting and in\r\nthe other too much inclined to favour theoretical fancies?\r\n\r\nLogical arguments are insufficient here. It is essential that we\r\nshould obtain the verdict of experiment, which alone can furnish a\r\nvalid reply. But to which of the insects shall we go first?\r\n\r\nI remember something that dates back some forty years. Delighted with\r\na recent University triumph, I was staying at Cette, on my return from\r\nToulouse, where I had just passed my examination as a licentiate in\r\nnatural science. It gave me a fine chance of renewing my acquaintance\r\nwith the seaside flora, which had delighted me a few years before on\r\nthe shores of the wonderful Gulf of Ajaccio. It would have been\r\nfoolish to neglect it. A degree does not confer the right to cease\r\nstudying. If one really has a touch of the sacred fire in one's veins,\r\none remains a student all one's life, not of books, which are a poor\r\nresource, but of the great, inexhaustible school of actual things.\r\n\r\nOne day, then, in July, in the cool stillness of the dawn, I was\r\nbotanizing on the foreshore at Cette. For the first time I plucked the\r\n_Convolvulus soldanella_, which trails along the high-water mark its\r\nropes of glossy green leaves and its great pink bellflowers. Withdrawn\r\ninto his white, flat, heavily-keeled shell, a curious Snail, _Helix\r\nexplanata_, was slumbering, in groups, on the bent grasses.\r\n\r\nThe dry shifting sands showed here and there long series of imprints,\r\nrecalling, on a smaller scale and under another form, the tracks of\r\nlittle birds in the snow which used to arouse a delightful flutter in\r\nmy youthful days. What do these imprints mean?\r\n\r\nI follow them, a hunter on the trail of a new species. At the end of\r\neach track, by digging to no great depth, I unearth a magnificent\r\nCarabus, whose very name is almost unknown to me. It is the Giant\r\nScarites (_S. gigas_, FAB.).\r\n\r\nI make him walk on the sand. He exactly reproduces the tracks which\r\nput me on the alert. It was certainly he who, questing for game in the\r\nnight, marked the trail with his feet. He returned to his lair before\r\ndaylight; and now not a single Beetle is to be seen in the open.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic thrusts itself upon my notice. If I shake him\r\nfor a moment and then place him on the ground upon his back, he\r\nremains a long time without stirring. No other insect has yet\r\ndisplayed such persistent immobility, though I confess that my\r\ninvestigations in this respect have been only superficial. The detail\r\nis so thoroughly engraved on my memory that, forty years later, when I\r\nwant to experiment on the insects which are experts in the art of\r\nsimulating death, I at once think of the Scarites.\r\n\r\nA friend sends me a dozen from Cette, from the very beach on which I\r\nonce passed a delightful morning in the company of this skilful mimic\r\nof the dead. They reach me in perfect condition, mixed up in the same\r\npackage with some Pimeliae (_P. bipunctata_, FAB.), their compatriots\r\nin the sands beside the sea. Of these last, a pitiable crew, many have\r\nbeen disembowelled, absolutely emptied; others have merely stumps\r\ninstead of legs; a few, but only a few, are unwounded.\r\n\r\nIt was what one might have expected of these Carabidae, lawless\r\nhunters one and all. Tragic events took place in the box during the\r\njourney from Cette to Serignan. The Scarites gormandized riotously on\r\nthe peaceable Pimeliae.\r\n\r\nTheir tracks, which I followed long ago on the actual spot, bore\r\nevidence to their nocturnal rounds, apparently in search of their\r\nprey, the pot-bellied Pimelia, whose sole defence consists of a strong\r\narmour of welded wing-cases.[4] But what can such a cuirass avail\r\nagainst the bandit's ruthless pincers?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The Pimelia is a wingless Beetle.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nHe is indeed a mighty hunter, this Nimrod of the sea-shore. All black\r\nand glossy, like a jet bugle, his body is divided by a very narrow\r\ngroove at the waist. His weapon of offence consists of a pair of\r\nclaw-like mandibles of extraordinary vigour. None of our insects\r\nequals him in strength of jaw, if we except the Stag-beetle, who is\r\nfar better armed, or rather decorated, for the antlered mandibles of\r\nthe inmate of the oak are ornaments of the male's attire, not a\r\npanoply of battle.\r\n\r\nThe brutal Carabid, the eviscerator of the Pimeliae, knows how strong\r\nhe is. If I tease him a little on the table, he at once adopts a\r\nposture of defence. Well braced upon his short legs, especially the\r\nfore-legs, which are toothed like rakes, he dislocates himself in two,\r\nso to speak, thanks to the groove that divides him behind the\r\ncorselet; he proudly raises the fore-part of the body, his wide,\r\nheart-shaped thorax and massive head, opening his threatening pincers\r\nto their full extent. He is now an awesome sight. More: he has the\r\naudacity to rush at the finger which has touched him. Here of a surety\r\nis one not easily intimidated. I look twice before I handle him.\r\n\r\nI lodge my strangers partly under a wire-gauze cover and partly in\r\nglass jars, all supplied with a layer of sand. Each of them without\r\ndelay digs himself a burrow. The insect bends his head a long way down\r\nand, with the points of his mandibles, brought together to form a\r\npick-axe, he hews, digs and excavates with a will. The fore-legs,\r\nspread out and armed with hooks, gather the dust and rubbish into a\r\nload which is thrust backwards. In this way, a mound rises on the\r\nthreshold of the burrow. The dwelling grows deeper quickly and by a\r\ngentle slope reaches the bottom of the jar.\r\n\r\nChecked in the downward direction, the Scarites now digs against the\r\nglass wall and continues his work horizontally until he has obtained a\r\nlength of nearly twelve inches in all.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement of the gallery, almost the whole of which runs just\r\nunder the glass, is very useful to me, enabling me to follow the\r\ninsect in the privacy of its home. If I wish to observe its\r\nunderground operations, all that I need do is to remove the opaque\r\nsheath which I have been careful to put over the jar, in order to\r\nspare the creature the annoyance of the light.\r\n\r\nWhen the house is deemed to be long enough, the Scarites returns to\r\nthe entrance, which he works more carefully than the rest. He makes a\r\nfunnel of it, a pit with shifting, sloping sides. It is the Ant-lion's\r\ncrater on a larger scale and constructed in a more rustic fashion.\r\nThis mouth is continued by an inclined plane, kept free of all\r\nrubbish. At the foot of the slope is the vestibule of the horizontal\r\ngallery. Here, as a rule, the hunter lurks, motionless, with his\r\npincers half open. He is waiting.\r\n\r\nThere is a sound overhead. It is a specimen of game which I have just\r\nintroduced, a Cicada, a luscious morsel. The drowsy trapper at once\r\nwakes; he moves his palpi, which quiver with cupidity. Cautiously,\r\nstep by step, he climbs his inclined plane. He takes a glance outside\r\nthe funnel. The Cicada is seen.\r\n\r\nThe Scarites darts out of his pit, runs forward, seizes the Cicada and\r\ndrags her backwards. The struggle is brief, thanks to the trap of the\r\nentrance, which yawns like a funnel to receive even a bulky quarry and\r\ncontracts into a crumbling precipice that paralyses all resistance.\r\nThe slope is fatal: who crosses the brink can no longer escape the\r\nmurderer.\r\n\r\nHead first, the Cicada dives into the abyss, down which the spoiler\r\ndrags her by successive jerks. She is drawn into the low-ceilinged\r\ntunnel. Here the wings cease to flutter, for lack of space. She\r\nreaches the knacker's cellar, at the end of the corridor. The Scarites\r\nnow works at her for some time with his pincers, in order to reduce\r\nher to complete immobility, fearing lest she should escape; then he\r\nreturns to the mouth of the charnel-house.\r\n\r\nIt is not everything to possess plenty of game; the question next\r\narises how to consume it in peace. The door is therefore closed\r\nagainst importunate callers, that is to say, the insect fills the\r\nentrance to the tunnel with his mound of rubbish. Having taken this\r\nprecaution, he goes back again and sits down to his meal. He will not\r\nreopen his hiding-place nor remake the pit at the entrance until\r\nlater, when the Cicada has been digested and hunger makes its\r\nreappearance. Let us leave the glutton with his quarry.\r\n\r\nThe brief morning which I spent with him in his native place did not\r\nenable me to watch him at his hunting, on the sands of the beach; but\r\nthe facts gathered in captivity are enough to tell us all about it.\r\nThey show us in the Scarites a bold hero who is not to be intimidated\r\nby the biggest or strongest adversary.\r\n\r\nWe have seen him coming up from underground, falling on the\r\npassers-by, seizing them at some distance from the burrow and dragging\r\nthem forcibly into his cut-throat den. The Rose-chafer, the Common\r\nCockchafer are but small deer for him. He dares to attack the Cicada,\r\nhe dares to dig his hooks into the corpulent Pine-chafer. He is a\r\nfearless ruffian, ready for any crime.\r\n\r\nUnder natural conditions his audacity can be no less. On the contrary,\r\nthe familiar spots, freedom of movement, unlimited space and his\r\nbeloved salt air excite the warrior to yet greater feats of daring.\r\n\r\nHe has dug himself a refuge in the sand, with a wide, crumbling mouth.\r\nThis is not so that he may, like the Ant-lion, wait at the bottom of\r\nhis funnel for the passing of a victim which stumbles on the shifting\r\nslope and rolls into the pit. The Scarites disdains these petty\r\npoachers' methods, these fowlers' snares; he prefers a run across\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nHis long trails on the sand tell us of nocturnal rounds in search of\r\nbig game, often the Pimelia, sometimes the Half-spotted Scarab.[5] The\r\nfind is not consumed on the spot. To enjoy it at his ease, he needs\r\nthe peaceful darkness of the underground manor; and so the captive,\r\nseized by one leg with the pincers, is forcibly dragged along the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Cf. _The Sacred Beetle and Others_: chaps. ii. and vii.--\r\n_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nIf no precautions were taken, the introduction of the victim into the\r\nburrow would be impracticable, with a huge quarry offering a desperate\r\nresistance. But the entrance to the tunnel is a wide crater, with\r\ncrumbling walls. However large he be, the captive, tugged from below,\r\nenters and tumbles into the pit. The crumbling rubbish immediately\r\nburies him and paralyses his movements. The thing is done. The bandit\r\nnow proceeds to close his door and empty his prey's belly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\nTHE SIMULATION OF DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first insect that we will put to the question is that audacious\r\ndisemboweller, the savage Scarites. To provoke his state of inertia is\r\na very simple matter: I handle him for a moment, rolling him between\r\nmy fingers; better still, I drop him on the table, twice or thrice in\r\nsuccession, from a small height. When the shock due to the fall has\r\nbeen administered and, if need be, repeated, I turn the insect on its\r\nback.\r\n\r\nThis is enough: the prostrate Beetle no longer stirs, lies as though\r\ndead. The legs are folded on the belly, the antennae extended like the\r\narms of a cross, the pincers open. A watch beside me tells me the\r\nexact minute of the beginning and the end of the experiment. Nothing\r\nremains but to wait and especially to arm one's self with patience,\r\nfor the insect's immobility lasts long enough to become tedious to the\r\nobserver watching for something to happen.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the lifeless posture varies greatly on the same day,\r\nunder the same atmospheric conditions and with the same subject,\r\nthough I cannot fathom the causes which shorten or lengthen it. How to\r\ninvestigate the external influences, so numerous and often so slight,\r\nwhich intervene in such a case; above all, how to scrutinize the\r\ninsect's private impressions: these are impenetrable mysteries. Let us\r\nconfine ourselves to recording the results.\r\n\r\nImmobility continues fairly often for as long as fifty minutes; in\r\ncertain cases, even, it lasts more than an hour. The most frequent\r\nlength of time averages twenty minutes. If nothing disturbs the\r\nBeetle, if I cover him with a glass shade, protecting him from the\r\nFlies, who are importunate visitors in the hot weather prevailing at\r\nthe time of my experiment, the inertia is complete: not a quiver of\r\nthe tarsi, nor of the palpi, nor of the antennae. Here indeed is a\r\nsimulacrum of death, with all its inertia.\r\n\r\nAt last the apparently deceased comes back to life. The tarsi quiver,\r\nthose of the fore-legs first; the palpi and the antennae move slowly\r\nto and fro: this is the prelude to the awakening. Now the legs begin\r\nto kick. The insect bends slightly at its pinched waist; it buttresses\r\nitself on its head and back; it turns over. There it goes, jogging\r\naway, ready to become an apparent corpse once more if I renew my shock\r\ntactics.\r\n\r\nLet us repeat the experiment immediately. The newly resuscitated\r\nBeetle is for a second time lying motionless on his back. He prolongs\r\nhis make-believe of death longer than he did at first. When he wakes\r\nup, I renew the test a third, a fourth, a fifth time, with no\r\nintervals of repose. The duration of the motionless condition\r\nincreases each time. To quote the figures, the five consecutive\r\nexperiments, from the first to the last, have continued respectively\r\nfor 17, 20, 25, 33 and 50 minutes. Starting with a quarter of an hour,\r\nthe attitude of death ends by lasting nearly a whole hour.\r\n\r\nWithout being constant, similar facts recur repeatedly in my\r\nexperiments, the duration, of course, varying. They tell us that as a\r\ngeneral rule the Scarites lengthens the period of his lifeless posture\r\nthe oftener the experiment is repeated. Is this a matter of practice,\r\nor is it an increase of cunning employed in the hope of finally tiring\r\na too persistent enemy? It would be premature to draw conclusions: the\r\ncross-examination of the insect has not yet been thorough enough.\r\n\r\nLet us wait. Besides, we need not imagine that it is possible to go on\r\nlike this until our patience is exhausted. Sooner or later, flurried\r\nby my pestering, the Scarites refuses to sham dead. Scarcely is he\r\nlaid on his back after a fall, when he turns over and takes to his\r\nheels, as though he judged a stratagem which succeeded so\r\nindifferently to be henceforth useless.\r\n\r\nIf we were to stop here, it would certainly seem that the insect, a\r\ncunning hoaxer, seeks, as a means of defence, to cheat those who\r\nattack him. He counterfeits death; he repeats the process, becoming\r\nmore persistent in his fraud in proportion as the aggression is\r\nrepeated; he abandons his trickery when he deems it futile. But\r\nhitherto we have subjected him only to a friendly\r\nexamination-in-chief. The time has come to put a string of searching\r\nquestions and to trick the trickster if there be really any deception.\r\n\r\nThe Beetle under experiment is lying on the table. He feels beneath\r\nhim a hard body which gives him no chance of digging. As he cannot\r\nhope to take refuge underground, an easy task for his nimble and\r\nvigorous tools, the Scarites lies low in his death-like pose, keeping\r\nit up, if need be, for an hour. If he were reclining on the sand, the\r\nloose soil with which he is so familiar, would he not regain his\r\nactivity more rapidly, would he not at least betray by a few twitches\r\nhis desire to escape into the basement?\r\n\r\nI was expecting to see him do so; and I was mistaken. Whether I place\r\nhim on wood, glass, sand or garden mould, the Beetle in no way\r\nmodifies his tactics. On a surface readily excavated he continues his\r\nimmobility as long as on an unassailable surface.\r\n\r\nThis indifference to the nature of the support half opens the door to\r\ndoubt; what follows opens it wide. The patient is on the table before\r\nme and I watch him closely. With his gleaming eyes, overshadowed by\r\nhis antennae, he also sees me; he watches me; he observes me, if I may\r\nso express myself. What can be the visual impression of the insect\r\nwhen face to face with that monstrosity, man? How does the pigmy\r\nmeasure the enormous monument that is the human body? Seen from the\r\ndepths of the infinitely little, the immense perhaps is nothing.\r\n\r\nWe will not go so far as that; we will admit that the insect watches\r\nme, recognizes me as his persecutor. So long as I am here, he will\r\nsuspect me and refuse to budge. If he does decide to do so, it will be\r\nafter he has exhausted my patience. Let us therefore move away. Then,\r\nsince any trickery will be needless, he will hasten to take to his\r\nlegs again and make off.\r\n\r\nI move ten paces farther from him, to the other end of the room. I\r\nhide, I do not move a muscle, for fear of breaking the silence. Will\r\nthe insect pick itself up? No, my precautions are superfluous. Alone,\r\nleft to itself, perfectly quiet, it remains motionless for as long a\r\ntime as when I was standing close beside it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the clear-sighted Scarites has seen me in my corner, at the\r\nother end of the room; perhaps a subtle scent has revealed my presence\r\nto him. We will do more, then. I cover him with a bell-glass which\r\nwill save him from being worried by the Flies and I leave the room; I\r\ngo downstairs into the garden. There is no longer anything likely to\r\ndisturb him. Doors and windows are closed. Not a sound from without;\r\nno cause for alarm indoors. What will happen in the midst of that\r\nprofound silence?\r\n\r\nNothing more and nothing less than usual. After twenty, forty minutes'\r\nwaiting out of doors, I come upstairs again and return to my insect. I\r\nfind him as I left him, lying motionless on his back.\r\n\r\nThis experiment, many times repeated with different subjects, throws a\r\nvivid light upon the question. It expressly assures us that the\r\nattitude of death is not the ruse of an insect in danger. Here there\r\nis nothing to alarm the creature. Around him all is silence, solitude,\r\nrepose. When he persists in his immobility it cannot now be to deceive\r\nan enemy. I have no doubt about it: there is something else involved.\r\n\r\nBesides, why should he need special defensive artifices? I could\r\nunderstand that a weak, pacific, ill-protected insect might resort to\r\nruses when in danger; but in him, the warlike bandit, so well\r\narmoured, it is more than I can understand. No insect on his native\r\nsea-shore has the strength to resist him. The most powerful of them,\r\nthe Sacred Beetle and the Pimelia, are easy-going creatures which, so\r\nfar from molesting him, are fine booty for his burrow.\r\n\r\nCan he be threatened by the birds? It is very doubtful. As a Carabus,\r\nhe is saturated with acrid humours which must make his body a far from\r\npleasing mouthful. For the rest, he lives hidden from the light of day\r\nin a burrow where no one sees him; he emerges only at night, when the\r\nbirds are no longer inspecting the beach. There are no beaks about for\r\nhim to fear.\r\n\r\nAnd this butcher of the Pimeliae and even occasionally of the Sacred\r\nBeetles, this bully whom no danger threatens, is supposed to be such a\r\ncoward as to sham death on the slightest alarm! I take the liberty of\r\ndoubting this more and more.\r\n\r\nI am confirmed in my doubts by the Smooth-skinned Scarites (_S.\r\nlavigatus_, FAB.), a denizen of the same shores. The first insect is a\r\ngiant; the second, by comparison, is a dwarf. Otherwise he displays\r\nthe same shape, the same jet-black costume, the same armour, the same\r\nhabits of brigandage. Well, the Smooth-skinned Scarites, in spite of\r\nhis weakness and his smallness, is almost ignorant of the trick of\r\npretending to be dead. When molested for a moment and then turned on\r\nhis back, he at once picks himself up and flees. I can hardly obtain a\r\nfew seconds' immobility; once only, daunted by my obstinacy, the dwarf\r\nremains motionless for a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nHow different from the giant, motionless the moment that he is thrown\r\nupon his back, sometimes picking himself up only after an hour of\r\ninaction! It is the reverse of what ought to happen, if the apparent\r\ndeath were really a defensive ruse. The giant, confident in his\r\nstrength, should disdain this cowardly posture; the timid dwarf should\r\nbe quick to have recourse to it. And it is just the other way about.\r\nWhat is there behind all this?\r\n\r\nLet us try the influence of danger. With what natural enemy shall I\r\nconfront the big Scarites, motionless on his back? I know none. Let us\r\nthen create a make-believe assailant. The Flies put me on the track of\r\none.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of their importunity during my investigations in the hot\r\nseason. If I do not employ a bell-glass or keep an assiduous watch,\r\nrarely does the shrewish Dipteron fail to alight upon my patient and\r\nexplore him with her proboscis. We will let her have her way this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHardly has the Fly grazed this apparent corpse with her legs, when the\r\nScarites' tarsi quiver as though twitched by a slight electric shock.\r\nIf the visitor be merely passing, matters go no farther; but, if she\r\npersist, particularly near the Beetle's mouth, moist with saliva and\r\ndisgorged secretions of food, the tormented Scarites promptly kicks,\r\nturns over and makes off.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he did not think it opportune to prolong his fraud in the face\r\nof so contemptible an enemy. He resumes his activity because he has\r\nrecognized the absence of danger. Then let us call in another\r\ninterloper, one of formidable size and strength. I happen to have\r\nhandy a Great Capricorn, with powerful claws and mandibles. That the\r\nlong-horned insect is a peaceful creature I am well aware; but the\r\nScarites does not know it; on the sands of the shore he has never\r\nencountered such a colossus as this, who is capable of impressing less\r\ntimid creatures than he. Fear of the unknown will merely aggravate the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nGuided by the tip of my straw, the Capricorn sets his foot upon the\r\nprostrate insect. The Scarites' tarsi begin to quiver immediately. If\r\nthe contact be prolonged or multiplied, or if it become aggressive,\r\nthe dead insect gets on its legs again and scuttles off, just as the\r\ntitillations of the Fly have already shown me. When danger is imminent\r\nand all the more to be dreaded because its nature is unknown, the\r\ntrick of the simulation of death disappears and flight takes its\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe following experiment is not without value. I take some hard\r\nsubstance and knock the foot of the table on which the insect is lying\r\non its back. The shock is very slight, not enough to shake the table\r\nperceptibly. The whole thing is limited to the inner vibrations of a\r\nresilient body which has received a blow. But it is quite enough to\r\ndisturb the insect's immobility. At each tap the tarsi are flexed and\r\nquiver for a moment.\r\n\r\nLastly, let us try the effect of light. So far, the patient has been\r\ntreated in the shade of my cabinet, away from the direct sunlight. The\r\nsun is shining full upon the window. What will the motionless insect\r\ndo if I carry it thither, from my table to the window, into the bright\r\nlight? That we can find out in a moment. Under the direct rays of the\r\nsun, the Scarites immediately turns over and moves off.\r\n\r\nThis is enough. Patient, persecuted creature, you have half-betrayed\r\nyour insect. When the Fly tickles you, drains your moist lip, treats\r\nyou as a corpse whose juices she would like to suck; when the huge\r\nCapricorn appears to your horrified gaze and puts a foot on your\r\nbelly, as though to take possession of his prey; when the table\r\nquivers, that is to say, when, for you, the ground shakes, undermined\r\nperhaps by some invader of your burrow; when a bright light surrounds\r\nyou, favouring the designs of your enemies and imperilling your safety\r\nas an insect that loves the dark, then, in truth, it would be wiser\r\nnot to move, if really your chief resource, when danger threatens you,\r\nis to simulate death.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, at those critical moments, you give a start; you\r\nmove, you resume your normal attitude, you run away. Your fraud is\r\ndiscovered; or, to put it more plainly, there is no trick. Your\r\ninertia is not simulated; it is real. It is a condition of temporary\r\ntorpor into which you are plunged by your delicate nervous\r\norganization. A mere nothing makes you fall into it; a mere nothing\r\nwithdraws you from it, above all a bath of light, that sovran stimulus\r\nof activity.\r\n\r\nIn respect of prolonged immobility as the result of emotion, I find a\r\nrival of the Giant Scarites in a large black Buprestis, with a\r\nflour-speckled corselet, a lover of the blackthorn, the hawthorn and\r\nthe apricot-tree. His name is _Capnodis tenebrionis_, LIN. At times I\r\nsee him, with his legs closely folded and his antennae lowered,\r\nprolonging his motionless posture upon his back for more than an hour.\r\nAt other times the insect is bent upon escaping, apparently influenced\r\nby atmospheric conditions of which I do not know the secret. One or\r\ntwo minutes' immobility is as much as I can then obtain.\r\n\r\nLet me recapitulate: in my various subjects the attitude of death is\r\nof very variable duration, governed as it is by a host of unsuspected\r\ncircumstances. Let us take advantage of favourable opportunities,\r\nwhich are fairly frequent. I subject the Cloudy Buprestis to the\r\ndifferent tests undergone by the Giant Scarites. The results are the\r\nsame. When you have seen the first, you have seen the second. There is\r\nno need to linger over them.\r\n\r\nI will only mention the promptness with which the Buprestis, lying\r\nmotionless in the shade, recovers his activity when I carry him away\r\nfrom my table into the broad sunlight of the window. After a few\r\nseconds of this bath of heat and light, the insect half-opens his\r\nwing-cases, using them as levers, and turns over, ready to take flight\r\nif my hand did not instantly snap him up. He is a passionate lover of\r\nthe light, a devotee of the sun, intoxicating himself in its rays upon\r\nthe bark of his blackthorn-trees on the hottest afternoons.\r\n\r\nThis love of tropical temperature suggests the following question:\r\nwhat would happen if I were to chill the creature in its immobile\r\nposture? I foresee a more prolonged inertia. The chill, of course,\r\nmust not be great, for it would be followed by the lethargy into which\r\ninsects capable of surviving the winter fall when benumbed by the\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the Buprestis must as far as possible retain his full\r\nvitality. The lowering of the temperature must be gentle, very\r\nmoderate and such that the insect, under similar climatic conditions,\r\nwould retain his powers of action in ordinary life. I have a\r\nconvenient refrigerator at my disposal. It is the water of my well,\r\nwhose temperature, in summer, is nearly twenty-two degrees Fahrenheit\r\nbelow that of the surrounding air.\r\n\r\nThe Buprestis, in whom I have just produced inertia by means of a few\r\ntaps, is installed on his back in a little flask which I seal\r\nhermetically and immerse in a bucket full of this cold water. To keep\r\nthe bath as cool as at first, I gradually renew it, taking care not to\r\nshake the flask in which the patient is lying, in his attitude of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe result rewards my pains. After five hours under water, the insect\r\nis still motionless. Five hours, I say, five long hours; and I might\r\ncertainly say longer, if my exhausted patience had not put an end to\r\nthe experiment. But this is enough to banish any idea of fraud on the\r\ninsect's part. Here, beyond a doubt, the insect is not shamming dead.\r\nHe is actually somnolent, deprived of the power of movement by an\r\ninternal disturbance which my teasing produced at the outset and which\r\nis prolonged beyond its usual limits by the surrounding coolness.\r\n\r\nI try the effect of a slight decrease in temperature upon the Giant\r\nScarites by subjecting him to a similar sojourn in the cold water of\r\nthe well. The result does not respond to the hopes which the Buprestis\r\ngave me. I do not succeed in obtaining more than fifty minutes'\r\ninertia. I have often obtained as long periods of immobility without\r\nresorting to the refrigerating artifice.\r\n\r\nIt might have been foreseen. The Buprestis, a lover of the burning\r\nsunshine, is affected by the cold bath in a different degree from the\r\nScarites, who prowls about by night and spends his day in the\r\nbasement. A fall of a few degrees in temperature takes the chilly\r\ninsect by surprise and has no effect upon the one accustomed to the\r\ncoolness underground.\r\n\r\nOther experiments on these lines tell me nothing more. I see the inert\r\ncondition persisting sometimes for a longer, sometimes for a shorter\r\nperiod, according as the insect seeks the sunlight or avoids it. Let\r\nus change our method.\r\n\r\nI evaporate a few drops of sulphuric ether in a glass jar and put in a\r\nStercoraceous Geotrupes and a specimen of _Buprestis tenebrionis_, at\r\nthe same time. In a few moments both subjects are motionless,\r\nanaesthetized by the etheric vapour. I take them out quickly and lay\r\nthem on their backs in the open air.\r\n\r\nTheir attitude is exactly that which they would have assumed under the\r\ninfluence of a shock or any other cause of alarm. The Buprestis has\r\nhis legs symmetrically folded against his chest and belly; the\r\nGeotrupes has his outspread, stretched in disorder, rigid and as\r\nthough attacked by catalepsy. You could not tell if they were dead or\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nThey are not dead. In a minute or two, the Geotrupes' tarsi twitch,\r\nthe palpi quiver, the antennae wave gently to and fro. Then the\r\nfore-legs move; and a quarter of an hour has not elapsed before the\r\nother legs are struggling. The activity of the insect made motionless\r\nby the concussion of a shock would reawaken in precisely the same\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nAs for the Buprestis, he is in a state of inertia so profound that at\r\nfirst I really believe him to be dead. He recovers during the night;\r\nand next day I find him in possession of his usual activity. The ether\r\nexperiment, which I took care to stop at the moment when it produced\r\nthe desired effect, has not been fatal to him; but it has had much\r\nmore serious consequences for him than for the Geotrupes. The insect\r\nmore sensitive to the alarm due to concussion or to a fall of\r\ntemperature is also the more sensitive to the action of ether.\r\n\r\nThus the enormous difference which I observe in these two insects,\r\nwith regard to the inertia provoked by a shock or by handling them in\r\none's fingers, is explained by nice differences of impressionability.\r\nWhereas the Buprestis remains motionless for nearly an hour, the\r\nGeotrupes is struggling violently after a minute or two. And even then\r\nI rarely attain this limit.\r\n\r\nIn what respect has the Geotrupes, to defend itself, less need of the\r\nstratagem of simulated death than the Black Buprestis, well protected\r\nby his massive build and his armour, which is so hard that it resists\r\nthe point of a pin and even of a needle? We should be perplexed by the\r\nsame question in respect of a multitude of insects, some of which\r\nremain motionless while others do not; and we could not possibly\r\nforesee what would happen from the genus of the subject, its form, or\r\nits way of living.\r\n\r\n_Buprestis tenebrionis_, for example, exhibits a persistent inertia.\r\nWill it be the same, because of similarity of structure, with other\r\nmembers of the same group? Not at all. My chance finds provide me with\r\nthe Brilliant Buprestis (_B. rutilans_, FAB.), and the Nine-spotted\r\nBuprestis (_Ptosima novemmaculata_, FAB.). The first resists all my\r\nattempts. The splendid creature grips my fingers, grips my tweezers\r\nand insists on getting up the moment that I lay it on its back. The\r\nsecond readily becomes immobile; but how brief is its attitude of\r\ndeath! Four or five minutes at most.\r\n\r\nA Melasoma-beetle, _Omocrates abbreviatus_, OLIV., whom I frequently\r\ndiscover under the broken stones on the neighbouring hills, continues\r\nmotionless for over an hour. He rivals the Scarites. We must not\r\nforget to add that very often the awakening takes place within a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nCan he owe his long period of inertia to the fact that he is one of\r\nthe Tenebrionidae, or Darkling Beetles? By no means, for here in the\r\nsame group is _Pimelia bipunctata_, who turns a somersault on his\r\nround back and finds his feet the moment he has turned over; here is a\r\nCellar-beetle (_Blaps similis_, LATR.), who, unable to turn with his\r\nflat back, his big belly and his welded wing-cases,[1] struggles\r\ndesperately after a minute or two of inertia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Cellar-beetle is one of the wingless\r\nBeetles.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThe short-legged Beetles, trotting along with tiny steps, ought, one\r\nwould think, to make up in cunning, more fully than the others, for\r\ntheir incapacity for rapid flight. The facts do not correspond with\r\nthis apparently well-founded forecast. I have consulted the genera\r\nChrysomela,[2] Blatta,[3] Silpha, Cleonus,[4] Bolboceras,[5] Cetonia,\r\nHoplia, Coccinella,[6] and so on. A few minutes or a few seconds are\r\nnearly always long enough for the return to activity. Several of them\r\neven obstinately refuse to sham death.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Golden-apple Beetles.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Blackbeetles or Cockroaches.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: A genus of Weevils.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: A mushroom-eating Beetle. Cf. _The Life of the Fly_:\r\nchap. xviii.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Ladybirds.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nAs much must be said of the Beetles well-equipped for pedestrian\r\nescape. Some remain motionless for a few seconds; others, more\r\nnumerous still, behave in an ungovernable fashion. In short, there is\r\nno guide to tell us in advance:\r\n\r\n\"This one will readily assume the posture of a dead insect; this one\r\nwill hesitate; that one will refuse.\"\r\n\r\nThere is nothing but shadowy probabilities, until experiment has given\r\nits verdict. From this muddle shall we draw a conclusion which will\r\nset our minds at rest? I hope so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\nSUICIDE OR HYPNOSIS?\r\n\r\n\r\nYou do not imitate the unfamiliar; you do not counterfeit a thing of\r\nwhich you know nothing: that is obvious. The simulation of death,\r\ntherefore, implies a certain knowledge of death.\r\n\r\nWell, has the insect, or rather, has any kind of animal, a\r\npresentiment that its life cannot last for ever? Does the perturbing\r\nproblem of an end occur to its dense brain? I have associated a great\r\ndeal with animals, I have lived on intimate terms with them and I have\r\nnever observed anything to justify me in saying yes. The animal, with\r\nits humbler destiny, is spared that apprehension of the hour of death\r\nwhich constitutes at once our torment and our greatness.\r\n\r\nLike the child still in the limbo of unconsciousness, it enjoys the\r\npresent without taking thought of the future; free from the bitterness\r\nof a prospective ending, it lives in the blissful calm of ignorance.\r\nIt is ours alone to foresee the briefness of our days; it is ours\r\nalone anxiously to question the grave regarding the last sleep.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this glimpse of the inevitable destruction calls for a\r\ncertain maturity of mind and, for that reason, is rather late in\r\ndeveloping. I had a touching example of it this very week.\r\n\r\nA pretty little Kitten, the joy of all the household, after languidly\r\ndragging itself about for a couple of days, died in the night. Next\r\nmorning the children found it lying stark in its basket. General\r\naffliction. Anna, especially, a little girl of four, considered with a\r\npensive glance the little friend with which she had so often played.\r\nShe petted it, called it, offered it a drop of milk in a cup:\r\n\r\n\"Kitty won't play,\" said the child. \"She doesn't want my breakfast any\r\nmore. She's asleep. I've never seen her sleep like this before. When\r\nwill she wake up?\"\r\n\r\nThis simplicity in the presence of death's harsh problem wrung my\r\nheart. Hastily I led the girl away from the sight and had the dead\r\nKitten secretly buried. As, from this time onward, it no longer\r\nappeared by the table at meal-times, the grief-stricken child at last\r\nunderstood that she had seen her little friend sleeping the profound\r\nslumber that knows no awaking. For the first time a vague idea of\r\ndeath found its way into her mind.\r\n\r\nHas the insect the signal honour of knowing what we do not know in our\r\nearly childhood, at a time when thought is already manifesting itself,\r\nfar superior, however feeble it be, to the dull understanding of the\r\nanimal? Has it the power to foresee an ending, an attribute which in\r\nits case would be inconvenient and useless? Before deciding, let us\r\nconsult, not the abstruse theories of science, a doubtful guide, but\r\nthe Turkey, an eminently truthful one.\r\n\r\nI recall one of the most vivid memories that remain to me from my\r\nbrief sojourn at the Royal College of Rodez. So they called it then;\r\nto-day they call it a grammar-school; what improvement as the world\r\ngrows older!\r\n\r\nThe thrice-blessed Thursday had come; our bit of translation was done,\r\nour dozen Greek roots had been learnt by heart; and we trooped down to\r\nthe far end of the valley, so many bands of madcaps. With our trousers\r\nturned up to our knees, we exploited, artless fishermen that we were,\r\nthe peaceful waters of the river, the Aveyron. What we hoped to catch\r\nwas the Loach, no bigger than our little finger, but tempting, thanks\r\nto his immobility on the sand amid the waterweeds. We fully expected\r\nto transfix him with our trident, a fork.\r\n\r\nThis miraculous catch, the object of such shouts of triumph when it\r\nsucceeded, was very rarely vouchsafed to us: the Loach, the rascal,\r\nsaw the fork coming and with three strokes of his tail disappeared!\r\n\r\nWe found compensation in the apple-trees in the neighbouring pastures.\r\nThe apple has from all time been the urchin's delight, above all when\r\nplucked from a tree which does not belong to him. Our pockets were\r\nsoon crammed with the forbidden fruit.\r\n\r\nAnother distraction awaited us. Flocks of Turkeys were not rare,\r\nroaming at their own sweet will and gobbling up the Locusts around the\r\nfarms. If no watcher hove in sight, we had great sport. Each of us\r\nwould seize a Turkey, tuck her head under her wing, rock it in this\r\nattitude for a moment and then place her on the ground, lying on her\r\nside. The bird no longer budged. The whole flock of Turkeys was\r\nsubjected to our hypnotic handling; and the meadow assumed the aspect\r\nof a battle-field strewn with the dead and dying.\r\n\r\nAnd now look out for the farmer's wife! The loud gobbling of the\r\nharassed birds had told her of our wicked pranks. She would run up\r\narmed with a whip. But we had good legs in those days! And we had a\r\ngood laugh too, behind the hedges, which favoured our retreat!\r\n\r\nO delightful days when we put the Turkeys to sleep, can I recover the\r\nskill which I then possessed? To-day it is no longer the playful trick\r\nof a schoolboy; it is a matter of serious research. I happen to have\r\nthe very subject that I need: a Turkey-hen, doomed soon to be the\r\nvictim of our Christmas merry-making. I repeat with her the method of\r\nmanipulation which I employed so successfully on the banks of the\r\nAveyron. I tuck her head well under her wing and, molding it in this\r\nattitude with both hands, I rock the bird gently up and down for a\r\ncouple of minutes.\r\n\r\nThe strange effect is produced; my childhood's manoeuvres obtained no\r\nbetter result. Laid on the ground, on her side and left to herself, my\r\npatient is a lifeless bundle. One would think her dead, if a slight\r\nrise and fall of the plumage did not reveal the breathing. She looks\r\nreally like a dead bird which, in a last convulsion, had drawn its\r\nchilled feet, with their shrivelled toes, under its belly. The\r\nspectacle has a tragic air; and I feel overcome by a certain anxiety\r\nwhen I gaze upon the results of my evil spells. Poor Turkey! What if\r\nshe were never to wake again!\r\n\r\nWe need not be afraid: she is waking; she stands up, staggering a\r\nlittle, it is true, with drooping tail and a shamefaced expression.\r\nThat soon passes off; not a trace of it remains. In a few moments the\r\nbird is once more what it was before the experiment.\r\n\r\nThis torpor, the mean between true sleep and death, is of variable\r\nduration. When repeatedly provoked in my Turkey-hen, with suitable\r\nintervals of repose, immobility lasts sometimes for half an hour and\r\nsometimes for a few minutes. Here, as in the insect, it would be very\r\ndifficult to analyse the causes of these differences. With the\r\nGuinea-fowl I succeed even better. The torpor lasts so long that I\r\nbecome alarmed by the bird's condition. The plumage reveals no trace\r\nof breathing. I ask myself, anxiously, whether the bird is not\r\nactually dead. I push it a little way along the ground with my foot.\r\nThe patient does not stir. I do it again. And lo, the Guinea-fowl\r\nfrees her head, stands up, regains her balance and scurries off! Her\r\nstate of lethargy has lasted more than half an hour.\r\n\r\nNow for the Goose. I have none. The gardener next door trusts me with\r\nhis. She is brought to my house, which she fills with her trumpeting\r\nas she waddles about. Shortly afterwards there is absolute silence:\r\nthe web-footed Amazon is lying on the ground, with her head tucked\r\nunder her wing. Her immobility is as profound and as prolonged as that\r\nof the Turkey and the Guinea-fowl.\r\n\r\nIt is the Hen's turn now and the Duck's. They too succumb, but, so it\r\nseems to me, less persistently. Can it be that my hypnotic tricks are\r\nless efficacious with small birds than with large ones? To judge by\r\nthe Pigeon, this may well be so. He yields to my art only to the\r\nextent of two minutes' sleep. A still smaller bird, a Greenfinch, is\r\neven more refractory: all that I obtain from him is a few seconds'\r\ndrowsiness.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, then, that, in proportion as the activity is\r\nconcentrated in a body of less volume, the torpor has less hold. The\r\ninsect has already shown us this. The Giant Scarites does not stir for\r\nan hour, while the Smooth-skinned Scarites, a pigmy, wearies my\r\npersistence in turning him over; the large Cloudy Buprestis submits to\r\nmy manoeuvres for a long period, whereas the Glittering Buprestis, a\r\npigmy again, obstinately refuses to do so.\r\n\r\nWe will leave on one side, as insufficiently investigated, the\r\ninfluence of the bodily mass and remember only this fact, that it is\r\npossible, by a very simple artifice, to reduce a bird to a condition\r\nof apparent death. Do my Goose, my Turkey and the others resort to\r\ntrickery with the object of deceiving their tormentor? It is certain\r\nthat none of them thinks of shamming dead; they are actually immersed\r\nin a deep torpor; in a word, they are hypnotized.\r\n\r\nThese facts have long been known; they are perhaps the first in date\r\nin the science of hypnosis or artificial sleep. How did we, the little\r\nRodez schoolboys, learn the secret of the Turkey's slumber? It was\r\ncertainly not in our books. Coming from no one knows where,\r\nindestructible as everything that enters into children's games, it was\r\nhanded down, from time immemorial, from one initiate to another.\r\n\r\nThings are just the same to-day in my village of Serignan, where there\r\nare numbers of youthful adepts in the art of putting poultry to sleep.\r\nScience often has very humble beginnings. There is nothing to tell us\r\nthat the mischief of a pack of idle urchins is not the starting-point\r\nof our knowledge of hypnosis.\r\n\r\nI have just been practising on insects tricks which to all appearances\r\nare as puerile as those which we practised on the Turkeys in the days\r\nwhen the farmer's wife used to run after us cracking her whip. Do not\r\nlaugh: a serious problem looms behind this artlessness.\r\n\r\nMy insects' condition bears a strange resemblance to that of my\r\npoultry. Both present the image of death, inertia, the contraction of\r\nconvulsed limbs. In both again the immobility is dispelled before its\r\ntime by the agency of a stimulus, by sound in the case of the bird, by\r\nlight in that of the insect. Silence, darkness and tranquillity\r\nprolong it. Its duration varies greatly in different species and\r\nappears to increase with corpulence.\r\n\r\nAmong ourselves, who are very unequal subjects for induced sleep, the\r\nhypnotist is obliged to pick and choose. He succeeds with one and not\r\nwith another. Similarly, among the insects, a selection is necessary,\r\nfor they do not all of them, by a long way, respond to the\r\nexperimenter's attempts. My best subjects have been the Giant Scarites\r\nand the Cloudy Buprestis; but how many others have resisted quite\r\nindomitably, or remained motionless for only a few seconds!\r\n\r\nThe insect's return to the active state presents certain peculiarities\r\nwhich are well worthy of attention. The key to the problem lies here.\r\nLet us return for a moment to the patients who have been subjected to\r\nthe ordeal of ether. These are really hypnotized. They do not remain\r\nmotionless by way of a ruse, there is no doubt upon that point; they\r\nare actually on the threshold of death; and, if I did not take them in\r\ngood time out of the flask in which a few drops of ether have been\r\nevaporated, they would never recover from the torpor whose last stage\r\nis death.\r\n\r\nNow what symptoms herald their return to activity? We know the\r\nsymptoms: the tarsi tremble, the palpi quiver, the antennae wave to\r\nand fro. A man emerging from a deep sleep stretches his limbs, yawns\r\nand rubs his eyes. The insect awaking from the etheric sleep likewise\r\nhas its own fashion of marking its recovery of consciousness: it\r\nflutters its tiny digits and the more mobile of its organs.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider an insect which, upset by a shock, perturbed by\r\nsome sort of excitement, is believed to be shamming dead, lying on its\r\nback. The return to activity is announced exactly in the same fashion\r\nand in the same order as after the stupefying effect of ether. First\r\nthe tarsi quiver; then the palpi and antennae wave feebly to and fro.\r\n\r\nIf the creature were really shamming, what need would it have of these\r\nminute preliminaries to the awakening? Once the danger has\r\ndisappeared, or is deemed to have done so, why does the insect not\r\nswiftly get upon its feet, to make off as quickly as possible, instead\r\nof dallying with untimely pretences? I am quite sure that, once the\r\nBear was gone, the comrade who had shammed dead under the animal's\r\nnose did not think of wasting time in stretching himself or rubbing\r\nhis eyes. He jumped up at once and took to his heels.\r\n\r\nAnd the insect is supposed to carry its cunning to the length of\r\ncounterfeiting resuscitation down to the least details! No, no and\r\nagain no; it would be madness. Those quiverings of the tarsi, those\r\nawakening movements of the palpi and antennae are the obvious proof of\r\na genuine torpor, now coming to an end, a torpor similar to that\r\ninduced by ether but less intense; they show that the insect struck\r\nmotionless by my artifice is not shamming dead, as the vulgar idiom\r\nhas it and as the fashionable theories repeat. It is really\r\nhypnotized.\r\n\r\nA shock which disturbs its nerve-centres, an abrupt fright which\r\nseizes upon it reduce it to a state of somnolence like that of the\r\nbird which is swung for a second or two with its head under its wing.\r\nA sudden terror sometimes deprives us human beings of the power of\r\nmovement, sometimes kills us. Why should not the insect's organism, so\r\ndelicate and subtle, give way beneath the grip of fear and momentarily\r\nsuccumb? If the emotion be slight, the insect shrinks into itself for\r\nan instant, quickly recovers and makes off; if it be profound,\r\nhypnosis supervenes, with its prolonged immobility.\r\n\r\nThe insect, which knows nothing of death and therefore cannot\r\ncounterfeit it, knows nothing either of suicide, that desperate means\r\nof cutting short excessive misery. No authentic example has ever been\r\ngiven, to my knowledge, of an animal of any kind robbing itself of its\r\nown life. That those most richly endowed with the capacity of\r\naffection sometimes allow themselves to die of grief I grant you; but\r\nthere is a great difference between this and stabbing one's self or\r\ncutting one's throat.\r\n\r\nYet the recollection occurs to me of the Scorpion's suicide, sworn to\r\nby some, denied by others. What truth is there in the story of the\r\nScorpion who, surrounded by a circle of fire, puts an end to his\r\nsuffering by stabbing himself with his poisoned sting? Let us see for\r\nourselves:\r\n\r\nCircumstances favour me. I am at this moment rearing, in large earthen\r\npans, with a bed of sand and with potsherds for shelter, a hideous\r\nmenagerie which hardly comes up to my expectations as regards the\r\nstudy of morals.[1] I will profit by it in another way. It consists of\r\nsome twenty-four specimens of _Buthus occitanus_, the large White\r\nScorpion of the south of France. The odious animal abounds, always\r\nisolated, under the flat stones of the neighbouring hills, in the\r\nsandy spots which enjoy the most sunlight. It has a detestable\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For the habits of the White or Languedocian Scorpion, cf.\r\n_The Life and Love of the Insect_: chaps. xvii. and\r\nxviii.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nOn the effects of its sting I personally have nothing to say, having\r\nalways avoided, by a little caution, the danger to which my relations\r\nwith the formidable captives in my study might have exposed me.\r\nKnowing nothing of it myself, I get people to tell me of it,\r\nwood-cutters in particular, who from time to time fall victims to\r\ntheir imprudence. One of them tells me the following story:\r\n\r\n\"After having my dinner, I was dozing for a moment among my faggots,\r\nwhen I was roused by a sharp pain. It was like the prick of a red-hot\r\nneedle. I clapped my hand to the place. Sure enough, there was\r\nsomething moving! A Scorpion had crept under my trousers and stung me\r\nin the lower part of the calf. The ugly beast was full as long as my\r\nfinger. Like that, sir, like that!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, adding gesture to speech, the worthy man extended his great\r\nfore-finger. This size did not surprise me: while insect-hunting, I\r\nhave seen Scorpions as large.\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to go on with my work,\" he continued, \"but I came out in a\r\ncold sweat; and my leg swelled up so you could see it swelling. It got\r\nas big as that, sir, as big as that.\"\r\n\r\nMore mimicry. Our friend spreads his two hands round his leg, at a\r\ndistance, so as to denote the girth of a small barrel:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, like that, sir, like that; I had great trouble to get home,\r\nthough it was only half a mile away. The swelling crept up and up.\r\nNext day it had got so high.\"\r\n\r\nA gesture indicates the height.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, for three days I couldn't stand up. I bore it as well as I\r\ncould, with my leg stretched out on a chair. Soda-compresses did the\r\ntrick; and there you are, sir, there you are.\"\r\n\r\nAnother woodcutter, he adds, was also stung in the lower part of the\r\nleg. He was binding faggots together at some distance and had not the\r\nstrength to regain his home. He collapsed by the side of the road.\r\nSome men passing by carried him on their shoulders:\r\n\r\n\"_A la cabro morto, moussu, a la cabro morto!_\"\r\n\r\nThe story of the rustic narrator, more versed in mimicry than in\r\nspeech, does not seem to me exaggerated. A White Scorpion's sting is a\r\nvery serious accident for a human being. When stung by his own kind,\r\nthe Scorpion himself quickly succumbs. Here I have something better\r\nthan the evidence of strangers: I have my own observations.\r\n\r\nI take two healthy specimens from my menagerie and place them together\r\nat the bottom of a glass jar on a layer of sand. Excited with the tip\r\nof a straw which brings them face to face again whenever they draw\r\nback, the two harassed creatures decide on mortal combat. Each no\r\ndoubt attributes to the other the annoyances of which I myself am the\r\ncause. The claws, those weapons of defence, are displayed in a\r\nsemicircle and open to keep the adversary at a distance; the tails, in\r\nsudden jerks, are flung forward above the back; the poison-phials\r\nclash together; a tiny drop, limpid as water, beads the point of the\r\nsting.\r\n\r\nThe fight does not last long. One of the Scorpions receives the full\r\nforce of the other's poisoned weapon. It is all over: in a few minutes\r\nthe wounded one succumbs. The victor very calmly proceeds to gnaw the\r\nfore-part of the victim's cephalothorax, or, in less crabbed terms,\r\nthe bit at which we look for a head and find only the entrance to a\r\nbelly. The mouthfuls are small, but long-drawn-out. For four or five\r\ndays, almost without a break, the cannibal nibbles at his murdered\r\ncomrade. To eat the vanquished, that's good warfare, the only sort\r\nexcusable. What I do not understand, nor shall until we tin the meat\r\non the battle-field for food, is our wars between nations.\r\n\r\nWe now have authentic information: the Scorpion's sting is fatal,\r\npromptly fatal, to the Scorpion himself. Let us come to the matter of\r\nsuicide, such as it has been described to us. When surrounded by a\r\ncircle of live embers, the animal, so we are told, stabs itself with\r\nits sting and finds an end of its torment in voluntary death. This\r\nwould be very fine on the creature's part if it were true. We shall\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of a ring of burning charcoal, I place the largest\r\nspecimen from my menagerie. The bellows increase the glow. At the\r\nfirst smart of the heat, the animal moves backwards within the circle\r\nof fire. It collides by inadvertence with the burning barrier. Now\r\nfollows a disorderly retreat, in every direction, at random, renewing\r\nthe agonizing contact. At each attempt to escape, the burning is\r\nrepeated more severely than before. The animal becomes frantic. It\r\ndarts forward and scorches itself. In a desperate frenzy, it\r\nbrandishes its weapon, crooks it, straightens it, lays it down flat\r\nand raises it again, all with such disorderly haste that I am quite\r\nunable to follow its movements accurately.\r\n\r\nThe moment ought to have come for the Scorpion to release himself from\r\nhis torture with a blow of the stiletto. And indeed, with a sudden\r\nspasm, the long-suffering creature becomes motionless, lies at\r\nfull-length, flat upon the ground. There is not a movement; the\r\ninertia is complete. Is the Scorpion dead? It really looks like it.\r\nPerhaps he has pinked himself with a thrust of his sting that escaped\r\nme in the turmoil of the last efforts. If he has actually stabbed\r\nhimself, if he has resorted to suicide, then he is dead beyond a\r\ndoubt: we have just seen how quickly he succumbs to his own venom.\r\n\r\nIn my uncertainty, I pick up the apparently dead body with the tip of\r\nmy forceps and lay it on a bed of cool sand. An hour later, the\r\nalleged corpse returns to life, as lusty as before the ordeal. I\r\nrepeat the process with a second and third specimen. The results are\r\nthe same. After the frantic plunges of the desperate victim, we have\r\nthe same sudden inertia, with the creature sprawling flat as though\r\nstruck by lightning, and the same return to life on the cool sand.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that those who invented the story of the Scorpion\r\ncommitting suicide were deceived by this sudden swoon, this paralysing\r\nspasm, into which the high temperature of the enclosure throws the\r\nexasperated beast. Too quickly convinced, they left the victim to burn\r\nto death. Had they been less credulous and withdrawn the animal in\r\ngood time from its circle of fire, they would have seen the apparently\r\ndead Scorpion return to life and thus assert its profound ignorance of\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\nApart from man, no living thing knows the last resource of a voluntary\r\nend, because none has a knowledge of death. As for us, to feel that we\r\nhave the power to escape from the miseries of life is a noble\r\nprerogative, upon which it is good to meditate, as a sign of our\r\nelevation above the commonalty of the animal world; but in point of\r\nfact it becomes cowardice if from the possibility we pass to action.\r\n\r\nHe who proposes to go to that length should at least repeat to himself\r\nwhat Confucius, the great philosopher of the yellow race, said\r\nfive-and-twenty centuries ago. Having surprised a stranger in the\r\nwoods fixing to the branch of a tree a rope wherewith to hang himself,\r\nthe Chinese sage addressed him in words the gist of which was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"However great your misfortunes, the greatest of all would be to yield\r\nto despair. All the rest can be repaired; this one is irreparable. Do\r\nnot believe that all is lost for you and try to convince yourself of a\r\ntruth which has been proved indisputable by the experience of the\r\ncenturies. And that truth is this: so long as a man has life, there is\r\nno need for him to despair. He may pass from the greatest misery to\r\nthe greatest joy, from the greatest misfortune to the highest\r\nfelicity. Take courage and, as though you were this very day beginning\r\nto recognize the value of life, strive at every moment to make the\r\nmost of it.\"\r\n\r\nThis humdrum Chinese philosophy is not without merit. It suggests the\r\nmoralizing of the fabulist:\r\n\r\n\"_... Qu'on me rende impotent,\r\nCul-de-jatte, goutteux, manchot, pourvu qu'en somme\r\nJe vive, c'est assez: je suis plus que content._\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"... So powerless let me lie,\r\n              Gout-ridden, legless, armless; if only, after all,\r\n              I live, it is enough: more than content am I.\"]\r\n\r\nYes, yes, La Fontaine and Kung the philosopher are right: life is a\r\nserious matter, which it will not do to throw away into the first bush\r\nby the roadside like a useless garment. We must look upon it not as a\r\npleasure, nor yet as a punishment, but as a duty of which we have to\r\nacquit ourselves as well as we can until we are given leave to depart.\r\n\r\nTo anticipate this leave is cowardly and foolish. The power to\r\ndisappear at will through death's trap-door does not justify us in\r\ndeserting our post; but it opens to us certain vistas which are\r\nabsolutely unknown to the animal.\r\n\r\nWe alone know how life's pageant closes, we alone can foresee our end,\r\nwe alone profess devotion to the dead. Of these high matters none\r\nother has any suspicion. When would-be scientists proclaim aloud, when\r\nthey declare that a wretched insect knows the trick of simulating\r\ndeath, we will ask them to look more closely and not to confound the\r\nhypnosis due to terror with the pretence of a condition unknown to the\r\nanimal world.\r\n\r\nOurs alone is the clear vision of an end, ours alone the glorious\r\ninstinct of the beyond. Here, filling its modest part, speaks the\r\nvoice of entomology, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Have confidence; never did an instinct fail to keep its promises.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\nTHE CRIOCERES\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a stubborn disciple of St. Thomas the Apostle and, before I agree\r\nto anything, I want to see and touch it, not once, but twice, thrice,\r\nan indefinite number of times, until my incredulity bows beneath the\r\nweight of evidence. Well, the Rhynchites[1] have told us that the\r\nbuild does not determine the instincts, that the tools do not decide\r\nthe trade. And now, yes, the Crioceres come and add their testimony. I\r\nquestion three of them, all common, too common, in my paddock. At the\r\nproper season, I have them before my eyes, without searching for them,\r\nwhenever I want to ask them for information.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A genus of Weevils, the essays upon whom will appear in a\r\nlater volume to be entitled _The Life of Weevil_.--_Translator's\r\nNote_.]\r\n\r\nThe first is the Crioceris of the Lily, or Lily-beetle. Since Latin\r\nwords offend our modesty let us just once mention her scientific name,\r\n_Crioceris merdigera_, LIN., without translating it, or, above all,\r\nrepeating it. Decency forbids. I have never been able to understand\r\nwhy natural history need inflict upon a lovely flower or an engaging\r\nanimal an odious name.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, our Crioceris, so ill-treated by the\r\nnomenclators, is a sumptuous creature. She is nicely shaped, neither\r\ntoo large nor too small, and a beautiful coral red, with jet-black\r\nhead and legs. Everybody knows her who in the spring has ever glanced\r\nat the lily, when its stem is beginning to show in the centre of the\r\nrosette of leaves. A Beetle, of less than the average size and\r\ncoloured sealing-wax red, is perched up on the plant. Your hand goes\r\nout to seize her. Forthwith, paralysed with fright, she drops to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nLet us wait a few days and return to the lily, which is gradually\r\ngrowing taller and beginning to show its buds, gathered together in a\r\nbundle. The red insect is still there. Further, the leaves, which are\r\nseriously bitten into, are reduced to tatters and soiled with little\r\nheaps of greenish ordure. It looks as if some witchcraft had mashed up\r\nthe leaves and then splashed the mess all over the place.\r\n\r\nWell, this filth moves, travels slowly along. Let us overcome our\r\nrepugnance and poke the heaps with a straw. We uncover, indeed we\r\nunclothe an ugly, pot-bellied, pale-orange larva. It is the grub of\r\nthe Crioceris.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the garment of which we have just stripped it would be\r\nunmentionable, save in the world of the insect, that manufacturer\r\ndevoid of shame. This doublet is, in fact, obtained from the\r\ncreature's excretions. Instead of evacuating downwards, on the\r\nsuperannuated principle, the Crioceris' larva evacuates upwards and\r\nreceives upon its back the waste products of the intestine, materials\r\nwhich move from back to front as each fresh pat is dabbed upon the\r\nothers. Reaumur has complacently described how the quilt moves forward\r\nfrom the tail to the head by wriggling along inclined planes, making\r\nso many dips in the undulating back. There is no need to return to\r\nthis stercoral mechanism after the master has done with it.\r\n\r\nWe now know the reasons that procured the Lily-beetle an ignominious\r\ntitle, confined to the official records: the grub makes itself an\r\novercoat of its excrements.\r\n\r\nOnce the garment is completed so as to cover the whole of the\r\ncreature's dorsal surface, the clothing-factory does not cease work on\r\nthat score. At the back a fresh hem is added from moment to moment;\r\nbut the overlapping superfluity in front drops off of its own weight\r\nat the same time. The coat of dung is under continual repair, being\r\nrenovated and lengthened at one end as it wears and grows shorter at\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nSometimes also the stuff is too thick and the heap capsizes. The\r\ndenuded grub recks nothing of the lost overcoat; its obliging\r\nintestine repairs the disaster without delay.\r\n\r\nWhether by reason of the clipping that results from the excessive\r\nlength of a piece which is always on the loom, or of accidents that\r\ncause a part or the whole of the load to fall off, the grub of the\r\nCrioceris leaves accumulations of dirt in its track, till the lily,\r\nthe symbol of purity, becomes a very cess-pool. When the leaves have\r\nbeen browsed, the stem next loses its cuticle, thanks to the nibbling\r\nof the grub, and is reduced to a ragged distaff. The flowers even,\r\nwhich have opened by now, are not spared: their beautiful ivory\r\nchalices are changed into latrines.\r\n\r\nThe perpetrator of the misdeed embarks on his career of defilement\r\nearly. I wanted to see him start, to watch him lay the first course of\r\nhis excremental masonry. Does he serve an apprenticeship? Does he work\r\nbadly at first, then a little better and then well? I now know all\r\nabout it: there is no noviciate, there are no clumsy attempts; the\r\nworkmanship is perfect from the outset, the product ejected spreads\r\nover the hinder part. Let me tell you what I saw.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are laid in May, on the under surface of the leaves, in short\r\ntrails averaging from three to six. They are cylindrical, rounded at\r\nboth ends, of a bright orange-red, glossy and varnished with a\r\nglutinous wash which makes them stick to the leaves throughout their\r\nlength. The hatching takes ten days. The shell of the egg, now a\r\nlittle wrinkled, but still of a bright orange colour, retains its\r\nposition, so that the group of eggs, apart from its slightly withered\r\nappearance, remains just as it was.\r\n\r\nThe young larva measures a millimetre and a half[2] in length. The\r\nhead and legs are black, the rest of the body a dull amber-red. On the\r\nfirst segment of the thorax is a brown sash, interrupted in the\r\nmiddle; lastly, there is a small black speck on each side, behind the\r\nthird segment. This is the initial costume. Presently orange-red will\r\ntake the place of the pale amber. The tiny creature, which is\r\nexceedingly fat, sticks to the leaf with its short legs and also with\r\nits hind-quarters, which act as a lever and push the round belly\r\nforwards. The motion reminds you of a cripple sitting in a bowl.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: .959 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThe grubs emerging from any one group of eggs at once begin to browse,\r\neach beside the empty skin of its egg. Here, singly, they nibble and\r\ndig themselves a little pit in the thickness of the leaf, while\r\nsparing the cuticle of the opposite surface. This leaves a translucent\r\nfloor, a support which enables them to consume the walls of the\r\nexcavation without risking a fall.\r\n\r\nSeeking for better pasture, they move lazily on. I see them scattered\r\nat random; a few of them are grouped in the same trench; but I never\r\nsee them browsing economically abreast as Reaumur relates. There is no\r\norder, no understanding between messmates, contemporaries though they\r\nbe and all sprung from the same row of eggs. Nor is any heed paid to\r\neconomy: the lily is so generous!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the paunch swells and the intestine labours. Here we are! I\r\nsee the first bit of the overcoat evacuated. As is natural in extreme\r\ninfancy, it is liquid and there is not much of it. The scanty flow is\r\nused all the same and is laid methodically, right at the far end of\r\nthe back. Let the little grub be. In less than a day, piece by piece,\r\nit will have made itself a suit.\r\n\r\nThe artist is a master from the first attempt. If its baby-flannel is\r\nso good to start with, what will the future ulster be, when the stuff,\r\nbrought to perfection, is of much better quality? Let us proceed; we\r\nknow what we want to know concerning the talents of this manufacturer\r\nof excremental broadcloth.\r\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of this nasty great-coat? Does the grub employ it\r\nto keep itself cool, to protect itself against the attacks of the sun?\r\nIt is possible: a tender skin need not be afraid of blistering under\r\nsuch a soothing poultice. Is it the grub's object to disgust its\r\nenemies? This again is possible: who would venture to set tooth to\r\nsuch a heap of filth? Or can it be simply a caprice of fashion, an\r\noutlandish fancy? I will not say no. We have had the crinoline, that\r\nsenseless bulwark of steel hoops; we still have the extravagant\r\nstove-pipe hat, which tries to mould our heads in its stiff sheath.\r\nLet us be indulgent to the evacuator nor disparage his eccentric\r\nwardrobe. We have eccentricities of our own.\r\n\r\nTo feel our way a little in this delicate question, we will question\r\nthe near kinsmen of the Lily-beetle. In my acre or two of pebbles I\r\nhave planted a bed of asparagus. The crop, from the culinary point of\r\nview, will never repay me for my trouble: I am rewarded in another\r\nfashion. On the scanty shoots which I allow to display themselves\r\nfreely in plumes of delicate green, two Crioceres abound in the\r\nspring: the field species (_C. campestris_, LIN.) and the\r\ntwelve-spotted species (_C. duodecimpunctata_, LIN.). A splendid\r\nwindfall, far better than any bundle of asparagus.\r\n\r\nThe first has a tricolor costume which is not without merit. Blue\r\nwing-cases, braided with white on the outer edge and each adorned with\r\nthree white dots; a red corselet, with a blue disk in the centre. Its\r\neggs are olive-green and cylindrical and, instead of lying flat,\r\ngrouped in short lines, after the manner of the lily-dweller's, occur\r\nsingly and stand on end on the leaves of the asparagus-plant, on the\r\ntwigs, on the flower-buds, more or less everywhere, without any fixed\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThough living in the open air on the leaves of its plant and thus\r\nexposed to all the various perils that may threaten the Lily-grub, the\r\nlarva of the Field Crioceris knows nothing whatever of the art of\r\nsheltering itself beneath a layer of ordure. It goes through life\r\nnaked and always perfectly clean.\r\n\r\nIt is of a bright greenish yellow, fairly fat behind and thinner in\r\nfront. Its principal organ of locomotion is the end of the intestine,\r\nwhich protrudes, curves like a flexible finger, clasps the twig and\r\nsupports the creature while pushing it forward. The true legs, which\r\nare short and placed too far in front with regard to the length of the\r\nbody, would find it very difficult by themselves to drag the heavy\r\nmass that comes after. Their assistant, the anal finger, is remarkably\r\nstrong. With no support, the larva turns over, head downwards, and\r\nremains suspended when shifting from one sprig to another. This\r\nJack-in-the-bowl is a rope-dancer, a consummate acrobat, performing\r\nits evolutions amid the slender sprigs without fear of a fall.\r\n\r\nIts attitude in repose is curious. The heavy stern rests on the two\r\nhind-legs and especially on the crooked finger, the end of the\r\nintestine. The fore-part is lifted in a graceful curve, the little\r\nblack head is raised and the creature looks rather like the crouching\r\nSphinx of antiquity. This pose is common at times of slumber and\r\nblissful digestion in the sun.\r\n\r\nAn easy prey is this naked, plump, defenceless grub, snoozing in the\r\nheat of a blazing day. Various Gnats, of humble size, but very likely\r\nterribly treacherous, haunt the foliage of the asparagus. The larva of\r\nthe Crioceris, motionless in its sphinx-like attitude, does not appear\r\nto be on its guard against them, even when they come buzzing above its\r\nrump. Can they be as harmless as their peaceful frolics seem to\r\nproclaim? It is extremely doubtful: the Fly rabble are not there\r\nmerely to imbibe the scanty exudations of the plant. Experts in\r\nmischief, they have no doubt hastened hither with another object.\r\n\r\nAnd, in truth, on the greater number of the Crioceris-larvae we find,\r\nadhering firmly to the skin, certain white specks, very small and of a\r\nchina-white. Can these be the sowing of a bandit, the spawn of a\r\nMidge?\r\n\r\nI collect the grubs marked with these white specks and rear them in\r\ncaptivity. A month later, about the middle of June, they shrivel,\r\nwrinkle and turn brown. All that is left of them is a dry skin which\r\ntears from end to end, half uncovering a Fly-pupa. A few days later,\r\nthe parasite emerges.\r\n\r\nIt is a small, greyish Fly, fiercely bristling with sparse hairs, half\r\nthe size of the House-fly, whom it resembles slightly. It belongs to\r\nthe Tachina group, who, in their larval form, so often inhabit the\r\nbodies of caterpillars.\r\n\r\nThe white spots sprinkled over the larva of the Crioceris were the\r\neggs of the hateful Fly. The vermin born of those eggs have perforated\r\nthe victim's paunch. By subtle wounds, which cause little pain and are\r\nalmost immediately healed, they have penetrated the body, reaching the\r\nhumours in which the entrails are bathed. At first the larva invaded\r\nis not aware of its danger; it continues to perform its rope-dancer's\r\ngymnastics, to fill its belly and to take its siestas in the sun, as\r\nthough nothing serious had occurred.\r\n\r\nReared in a glass tube and often examined under the lens, my\r\nparasite-ridden larvae betray no uneasiness. The fact is that the\r\nTachina's children display an infernal judgment in their first\r\nactions. Until the moment when they are ready for the transformation,\r\ntheir portion of game has to hold out, must be kept fresh and alive.\r\nThey therefore gorge themselves with the reserves intended for future\r\nuse, the fats, the savings which the Crioceris hoards in view of the\r\nremodelling whence the perfect insect will emerge; they consume what\r\nis not essential to the life of the moment and are very careful not to\r\ntouch the organs which are indispensable at the present time. If these\r\nreceived a bite, the host would die and so would they. Towards the end\r\nof their growth, prudence and discretion being no longer essential,\r\nthey make a complete clearance of the victim, leaving only the skin,\r\nwhich will serve them for a shelter.\r\n\r\nOne satisfaction is vouchsafed me in these horrible orgies: I see that\r\nthe Tachina in her turn is subjected to severe reductions. How many\r\nwere there on the larva's back? Perhaps eight, ten or more. One Midge,\r\nnever more than one, comes out of the victim's skin, for the morsel is\r\ntoo small to provide food for many. What has become of the others? Has\r\nthere been an internecine battle inside the poor wretch's body? Have\r\nthey eaten one another up, leaving only the strongest to survive, or\r\nthe one most favoured by the chances of the fight? Or has one of them,\r\nearlier developed than the rest, found himself master of the\r\nstronghold and have the others preferred to die outside rather than\r\nenter a grub already occupied, where famine would be rife if the\r\nmessmates numbered even two? I am all for mutual extermination.\r\nKinsman's flesh or stranger's flesh must be all one to the fangs of\r\nthe vermin swarming in the Crioceris' belly.\r\n\r\nFierce though the competition is among these bandits, the Beetle's\r\nrace does not threaten to die out. I review the innumerable troop on\r\nmy asparagus-bed. A good half of them have Tachina-eggs plainly\r\nvisible as tiny white specks on their green skins. The blemished\r\nlarvae tell me of a paunch already or on the point of being invaded.\r\nOn the other hand, it is doubtful whether those which are unscathed\r\nwill all remain in that condition. The malefactor is incessantly\r\nprowling around the green plumes, watching for a favourable\r\nopportunity. Many larvae free from white spots to-day will show them\r\nto-morrow or some other day, so long as the Fly's season lasts.\r\n\r\nI estimate that the vast majority of the troop will end by being\r\ninfested. My rearing-experiments tell me much on this point. If I do\r\nnot make a careful selection when I am stocking my wire-gauze-covers,\r\nif I go to work at random in picking the branches colonized with\r\nlarvae, I obtain very few adult Crioceres; nearly all of them are\r\nresolved into a cloud of Midges.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible for us to wage war effectually upon an insect, I\r\nshould advise asparagus-growers to have recourse to the Tachina,\r\nthough I should cherish no illusions touching the results of the\r\nexpedient. The exclusive tastes of the insect auxiliary draw us into a\r\nvicious circle: the remedy allays the evil, but the evil is\r\ninseparable from the remedy. To rid ourselves of the ravages of the\r\nasparagus-beds, we should need a great many Tachinae; and to obtain a\r\ngreat many Tachinae we should first of all need a great many ravagers.\r\nNature's equilibrium balances things as a whole. Whenever Crioceres\r\nabound, the Midges that reduce them arrive in numbers; when Crioceres\r\nbecome rare, the Midges decrease, but are always ready to return in\r\nmasses and repress a surplus of the others during a return of\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nUnder its thick mantle of ordure the grub of the Lily-beetle escapes\r\nthe troubles so fatal to its cousin of the asparagus. Strip it of its\r\novercoat: you will never find the terrible white specks upon its skin.\r\nThe method of preservation is most effective.\r\n\r\nWould it not be possible to find a defensive system of equal value\r\nwithout resorting to detestable filth? Yes, of course: the insect need\r\nonly house itself under a covering where there would be nothing to\r\nfear from the Fly's eggs. This is what the Twelve-spotted Crioceris\r\ndoes, occupying the same quarters as the Field Crioceris, from whom\r\nshe differs in size, being rather larger, and still more in her\r\ncostume, which is rusty red all over, with twelve black spots\r\ndistributed symmetrically on the wing-cases.\r\n\r\nHer eggs, which are a deep olive-green and cylindrical, pointed at one\r\npole and squared off at the other, closely resemble those of the Field\r\nCrioceris and, like these, usually stand up on the supporting surface,\r\nto which they are fastened by the square end. It would be easy to\r\nconfuse the two if we had not the position which they occupy to guide\r\nus. The Field Crioceris fastens her eggs to the leaves and the thin\r\nsprays; the other plants them exclusively on the still green fruit of\r\nthe asparagus, globules the size of a pea.\r\n\r\nThe grubs have to open a tiny passage for themselves and to make their\r\nown way into the fruit, of which they eat the pulp. Each globule\r\nharbours one larva, no more, or the ration would be insufficient.\r\nOften, however, I see two, three or four eggs on the same fruit. The\r\nfirst grub hatched is the one favoured by luck. He becomes the owner\r\nof the pill, an intolerant owner capable of wringing the neck of any\r\nwho should come and sit down at table beside him. Always and\r\neverywhere this pitiless competition!\r\n\r\nThe grub of the Twelve-spotted Crioceris is a dull white, with an\r\ninterrupted black scarf on the first segment of the thorax. This\r\nsedentary creature has none of the talents of the acrobat grazing on\r\nthe swaying foliage of the asparagus; it cannot take a grip with its\r\nposterior, turned into a prehensile finger. What use would it have for\r\nsuch a prerogative, loving repose as it does and destined to put on\r\nfat in its cell, without roaming in quest of food? In the same group\r\neach species has its own gifts, according to the kind of life that\r\nawaits it.\r\n\r\nIt is not long before the occupied fruit falls to the ground. Day by\r\nday, it loses its green colour as the pulp is consumed. It becomes, at\r\nlast, a pretty, diaphanous opal sphere, while the berries which have\r\nnot been injured ripen on the plant and acquire a rich scarlet hue.\r\n\r\nWhen there is nothing left to eat inside the skin of its pill, the\r\ngrub makes a hole in it and goes underground. The Tachinae have spared\r\nit. Its opal box, the hard rind of the berry, has ensured its safety\r\njust as well as a filthy overcoat would have done and perhaps even\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\nTHE CRIOCERES (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crioceris has found safety inside its opal globe. Safety? Ah, but\r\nwhat an unfortunate expression I have used! Is there any one in the\r\nworld who can flatter himself that he has escaped the spoiler?\r\n\r\nIn the middle of July, at the time when the Twelve-spotted Crioceris\r\ncomes up from under the ground in the adult form, my rearing-jars\r\nyield me swarms of a very small Gall-fly, a slender, graceful,\r\nblue-black Chalcid, without any visible boring-tool. Has the puny\r\ncreature a name? Have the nomenclators catalogued it? I do not know,\r\nnor do I much care; the main thing is to learn that the covering of\r\nthe asparagus-berry, which becomes an opal globe when the grub has\r\nemptied it, has failed to save the recluse. The Tachina-midge drains\r\nher victim by herself; this other, tinier creature feasts in company.\r\nTwenty or more of them batten on the grub together.\r\n\r\nWhen everything seems to foretell a quiet life, a pigmy among pigmies\r\nappears, charged with the express duty of exterminating an insect\r\nwhich is protected first by the casket of the berry and next by the\r\nshell, the underground work of the grub. To eat the Twelve-spotted\r\nCrioceris is its mission in life, its special function. When and how\r\ndoes it deliver its attack? I do not know.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, proud of her vocation and finding life sweet, the Chalcid\r\ncurls her antennae into a crook and waves them to and fro: she rubs\r\nher tarsi together, a sign of satisfaction; she dusts her belly. I can\r\nhardly see her with the naked eye; and yet she is an agent of the\r\nuniversal extermination, a wheel in the implacable machine which\r\ncrushes life as in a wine-press.\r\n\r\nThe tyranny of the belly turns the world into a robber's cave. Eating\r\nmeans killing. Distilled in the alembic of the stomach, the life\r\ndestroyed by slaughter becomes so much fresh life. Everything is\r\nmelted down again, everything has a fresh beginning in death's\r\ninsatiable furnace.\r\n\r\nMan, from the alimentary point of view, is the chief brigand,\r\nconsuming everything that lives or might live. Here is a mouthful of\r\nbread, the sacred food. It represents a certain number of grains of\r\nwheat which asked only to sprout, to turn green in the sun, to shoot\r\nup into tall stalks crowned with ears. They died that we might live.\r\nHere are some eggs. Left undisturbed with the Hen, they would have\r\nemitted the Chickens' gentle cheep. They died that we might live. Here\r\nis beef, mutton, poultry. Horror, it smells of blood, it is eloquent\r\nof murder! If we gave it a thought, we should not dare to sit down to\r\ntable, that altar of cruel sacrifices.\r\n\r\nHow many lives does the Swallow, to mention only the most peaceable,\r\nharvest in the course of a single day! From morning to evening he\r\ngulps down Crane-flies, Gnats and Midges joyously dancing in the\r\nsunbeams. Quick as lightning he passes; and the dancers are decimated.\r\nThey perish; then their melancholy remnants fall from the nest\r\ncontaining the young brood, in the form of guano which becomes the\r\nturf's inheritance. And so it is with all and everything, with large\r\nand small, from end to end of the animal progression. A perpetual\r\nmassacre perpetuates the flux of life.\r\n\r\nAppalled by these butcheries, the thinker begins to dream of a state\r\nof affairs which would free us from the horrors of the maw. This ideal\r\nof innocence, as our poor nature vaguely sees it, is not an\r\nimpossibility; it is partly realized for all of us, men and animals.\r\n\r\nBreathing is the most imperious of needs. We live by the air before we\r\nlive by bread; and this happens of itself, without painful struggles,\r\nwithout costly labour, almost without our knowledge. We do not set\r\nout, armed for war, to conquer the air by rapine, violence, cunning,\r\nbarter and desperate labour; the supreme element of life enters our\r\nbodies of its own accord; it penetrates us and quickens us. Each of us\r\nhas his generous share of it without giving the matter a thought.\r\n\r\nTo crown perfection, it is free. And this will last indefinitely until\r\nan ever ingenious Treasury invents distributing-taps and pneumatic\r\nreceivers from which the air will be doled out to us at so much a\r\npiston-stroke. Let us hope that we shall be spared this particular\r\nitem of scientific progress, for that, woe betide us, would be the end\r\nof all things: the tax would kill the tax-payer!\r\n\r\nChemistry, in its lighter moods, promises us, in the future, pills\r\ncontaining the concentrated essence of food. These cunning compounds,\r\nthe product of our laboratories, would not end our longing to possess\r\na stomach no more burdensome than our lungs and to feed even as we\r\nbreathe.\r\n\r\nThe plant partly knows this secret: it draws its carbon quietly from\r\nthe air, in which each leaf is impregnated with the wherewithal to\r\ngrow tall and green. But the vegetable is inactive; hence its innocent\r\nlife. Action calls for strongly flavoured spices, won by fighting. The\r\nanimal acts; therefore it kills. The highest phase, perhaps, of a\r\nself-conscious intelligence, man, deserving nothing better, shares\r\nwith the brute the tyranny of the belly as the irresistible motive of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nBut I have wandered too far afield. A living speck, swarming in the\r\npaunch of a grub, tells us of the brigandage of life. How well it\r\nunderstands its trade as an exterminator! In vain does the\r\nCrioceris-larva take refuge in an unassailable casket: its executioner\r\nmakes herself so small that she is able to reach it.\r\n\r\nAdopt such precautions as you please, you pitiable grubs, pose on your\r\nsprigs in the attitude of a threatening Sphinx, take refuge in the\r\nmysteries of a box, arm yourself with a cuirass of dung: you will none\r\nthe less pay your tribute in the pitiless conflict; there will always\r\nbe operators who, varying in cunning, in size, in implements, will\r\ninoculate you with their deadly germs.\r\n\r\nNot even the lily-dweller, with her dirty ways, is safe. Her grub is\r\nas often the prey of another Tachina, larger than that of the Field\r\nCrioceris. The parasite, I am convinced, does not sow her eggs upon\r\nthe victim so long as the latter is wrapped in its repulsive\r\ngreat-coat; but a moment's imprudence gives her a favourable\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nWhen the time comes for the grub to bury itself in the ground, there\r\nto undergo the transformation, it lays aside its mantle, with the\r\nobject perhaps of easing itself when it descends from the top of the\r\nplant, or else with the object of taking a bath in that kindly\r\nsunlight whereof it has hitherto tasted so little under its moist\r\ncoverlet. This naked journey over the leaves, the last joy of its\r\nlarval life, is fatal to the traveller. Up comes the Tachina, who,\r\nfinding a clean skin, all sleek with fat, loses no time in dabbing her\r\neggs upon it.\r\n\r\nA census of the intact and of the injured larvae provides us with\r\nparticulars which agree with what we foresaw from the nature of their\r\nrespective lives. The most exposed to parasites is the Field\r\nCrioceris, whose larva lives in the open air, without any sort of\r\nprotection. Next comes the Twelve-spotted Crioceris, who is\r\nestablished in the asparagus-berry from her early infancy. The most\r\nfavoured is the Lily-beetle, who, while a grub, makes an ulster of her\r\nexcretions.\r\n\r\nFor the second time, we are here confronted by three insects which\r\nlook as if they had all come out of one mould, so much are they alike\r\nin shape. If the costumes were not different and the sizes dissimilar,\r\nwe should not know how to tell one from another. And this pronounced\r\nresemblance in figure is accompanied by a no less pronounced lack of\r\nresemblance in instinct.\r\n\r\nThe evacuator that soils its back cannot have inspired the hermit\r\nliving in cleanly retirement inside its globe; the occupant of the\r\nasparagus-berry did not advise the third to live in the open and\r\nwander like an acrobat through the leafage. None of the three has\r\ninitiated the customs of the other two. All this seems to me as clear\r\nas daylight. If they have issued from the same stock, how have they\r\nacquired such dissimilar talents?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, have these talents developed by degrees? The Lily-beetle\r\nis prepared to tell us. Her grub, let us suppose, once conceived the\r\nnotion, when tormented by the Tachina, of making the stercoral slit\r\nopen above. By accident, with no definite purpose in view, it emptied\r\nthe contents of its intestine over its back. The natty Fly hesitated\r\nin the presence of this filth. The grub, in its cunning, recognized,\r\nas time went on, the benefit to be derived from its poultice; and what\r\nat first was an unpremeditated pollution became a prudent custom.\r\n\r\nAs success followed upon success, with the aid of the centuries, of\r\ncourse, for these inventions always take centuries, the dung overcoat\r\nwas extended from the hinder end to the fore-part, right down to the\r\nforehead. Finding itself the gainer by this invention, setting the\r\nparasite at defiance under its coverlet, the grub made a strict law of\r\nwhat was an accident; and the Crioceris faithfully handed down the\r\nrepulsive great-coat to her offspring.\r\n\r\nSo far this is not so bad. But things now begin to become complicated.\r\nIf the insect was really the inventor of its defensive methods, if it\r\ndiscovered for itself the advantage of hiding under its ordure, I look\r\nto its ingenuity to keep up the tricks until the precise moment has\r\ncome for burying itself. But, on the contrary, it undresses itself\r\nsome time beforehand; it wanders about naked, taking the air on the\r\nleaves, at a time when its fair round belly is more than ever likely\r\nto tempt the Fly. It completely forgets, on its last day, the prudence\r\nwhich it acquired by the long apprenticeship of the centuries.\r\n\r\nThis sudden change of purpose, this heedlessness in the face of danger\r\ntells me that the insect forgets nothing, because it has learnt\r\nnothing, because it has invented nothing. When the instincts were\r\nbeing distributed, it received as its share the overcoat, of whose\r\nmethods it is ignorant, though it benefits by its advantages. It has\r\nnot acquired it by successive stages, followed by a sudden halt at the\r\nmost dangerous moment, the moment most calculated to inspire it with\r\ndistrust; it is no more and no less gifted than it was in the\r\nbeginning and is unable in any way to alter its tactics against the\r\nTachina and its other enemies.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we must not be in a hurry to attribute to the garment of\r\nfilth the exclusive function of protecting the grub against the\r\nparasite. It is difficult to see in what respect the Lily-grub is more\r\ndeserving than the Asparagus-grub, which possesses no defensive arts.\r\nPerhaps it is less fruitful and, to make up for the poverty of the\r\novaries, boasts an ingenuity which safeguards the race. Nor is there\r\nanything to tell us that the soft coverlet is not at the same time a\r\nshelter which screens a too sensitive skin from the sun. And, if it\r\nwere a mere fal-lal, a furbelow of larval coquetry, even that would\r\nnot surprise me. The insect has tastes which we cannot judge by our\r\nown. Let us end with a doubt and proceed.\r\n\r\nMay is not over when the grub, now fully-grown, leaves the lily and\r\nburies itself at the foot of the plant, at no great depth. Working\r\nwith its head and rump, it forces back the earth and makes itself a\r\nround recess, the size of a pea. To turn the cell into a hollow pill\r\nwhich will not be liable to collapse, all that remains for it to do is\r\nto drench the wall with a glue which soon sets and grips the sand.\r\n\r\nTo observe this work of consolidation, I unearth some unfinished cells\r\nand make an opening which enables me to watch the grub at work. The\r\nhermit is at the window in a moment. A stream of froth pours from his\r\nmouth like beaten-up white of egg. He slavers, spits profusely; he\r\nmakes his product effervescence and lays it on the edge of the breach.\r\nWith a few spurts of froth the opening is plugged.\r\n\r\nI collect other grubs at the moment of their interment and install\r\nthem in glass tubes with a few tiny bits of paper which will serve\r\nthem as a prop. There is no sand, no building-material other than the\r\ncreature's spittle and my very few shreds of paper. Under these\r\nconditions can the pill-shaped cell be constructed?\r\n\r\nYes, it can; and without much difficulty. Supporting itself partly on\r\nthe glass, partly on the paper, the larva begins to slaver all around\r\nit, to froth copiously. After a spell of some hours, it has\r\ndisappeared within a solid shell. This is white as snow and highly\r\nporous; it might almost be a globule of whipped albumen. Thus, to\r\nstick together the sand in its pill-shaped nest, the larva employs a\r\nfrothy albuminous substance.\r\n\r\nLet us now dissect the builder. Around the oesophagus, which is fairly\r\nlong and soft, are no salivary glands, no silk-tubes. The frothy\r\ncement is therefore neither silk nor saliva. One organ forces itself\r\nupon our attention: it is the crop, which is very capacious, and\r\ndilated with irregular protuberances that put it out of shape. It is\r\nfilled with a colourless, viscous fluid. This is certainly the raw\r\nmaterial of the frothy spittle, the glue that binds the grains of sand\r\ntogether and consolidates them into a spherical whole.\r\n\r\nWhen the preparations for the metamorphosis are at hand, the stomachic\r\npouch, having no longer to do duty as a digestive laboratory, serves\r\nthe insect as a factory, or a warehouse for different purposes. Here\r\nthe Sitares store up their uric waste products; here the Capricorns\r\ncollect the chalky paste which becomes the stone lid for the entrance\r\nto the cell; here caterpillars keep in reserve the gums and powders\r\nwith which they strengthen the cocoon; hence the Hymenoptera draw the\r\nlacquer which they employ to upholster their silken edifice. And now\r\nwe find the Lily-beetle using it as a store for frothy cement.[1] What\r\nan obliging organ is this digestive pouch!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This subject is continued in the essay on the Foamy\r\nCicadella. Cf. _The Life of the Grasshopper_: chap. xx.--_Translator's\r\nNote_.]\r\n\r\nThe two Asparagus-beetles are likewise proficient dribblers, worthy\r\nrivals of their kinswoman of the lily in the matter of building. In\r\nall three cases the underground shell has the same shape and the same\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nWhen, after a subterranean visit of two months' duration, the\r\nLily-beetle returns to the surface in her adult form, a botanical\r\nproblem remains to be solved before the history of the insect is\r\ncompleted. We are now at the height of summer. The lilies have had\r\ntheir day. A dry, leafless stick, surmounted by a few tattered\r\ncapsules, is all that is left of the magnificent plant of the spring.\r\nOnly the onion-like bulb remains a little way down. There, postponing\r\nthe process of vegetation, it waits for the steady rains of the\r\nautumn, which will renew its strength and make it burgeon into a sheaf\r\nof leaves.\r\n\r\nHow does the Lily-beetle live during the summer, before the return of\r\nthe green foliage dear to its race? Does it fast during the extreme\r\nheat? If abstinence is its rule of life in this season of vegetable\r\ndearth, why does it emerge from underground, why does it abandon its\r\nshell, where it could sleep so peacefully, without the necessity of\r\neating? Can it be need of food that drives it from the substratum and\r\nsends it to the sunlight so soon as the wing-cases have assumed their\r\nvermilion hue? It is very likely. For the rest, let us look into the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nOn the ruined stems of my white lilies I find a portion covered with a\r\nscrap of green skin. I set it before the prisoners in my jars, who\r\nemerged from their sandy bed a day or two ago. They attack it with an\r\nappetite which is extremely conclusive; the green morsel is stripped\r\nbare to the wood. Soon I have nothing left, in the way of their\r\nregulation diet, to offer my famished captives. I know that all the\r\nlilies, native or exotic, the Turk's cap lily, or Martagon, the lily\r\nof Chalcedon, the tiger lily and many others, are to their taste; I do\r\nnot forget that the crown imperial fritillary and the Persian\r\nfritillary are equally welcome; but most of these delicate plants have\r\nrefused the hospitality of my two acres of pebbles and those which it\r\nis more or less possible for me to grow are now as tattered as the\r\ncommon lily. There is not a patch of green left on them.\r\n\r\nIn botany the lily gives its name to the family of the Liliaceae, of\r\nwhich it is the leading representative. Those who feed upon the lily\r\nought also, in the absence of anything better, to accept the other\r\nplants of the same group. This is my opinion at first; it is not that\r\nof the Crioceris, who knows more than I do about the virtues of\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThe family of the Liliaceae is subdivided into three tribes: the\r\nlilies, the daffodils and the asparaguses. Not any of the daffodil\r\ntribe suit my famishing prisoners, who allow themselves to die of\r\ninanition on the leaves of the following genera, the only varieties\r\nwith which the modest resources of my garden have allowed me to\r\nexperiment: asphodel, funkia, or niobe, agapanthus, or African lily,\r\ntritelia, hemerocallis, or day lily, tritoma, garlic, ornithogalum, or\r\nstar of Bethlehem, squill, hyacinth, muscari, or grape-hyacinth. I\r\nrecord, for whom it may concern, this profound contempt of the\r\nCrioceris for the daffodils. An insect's opinion is not to be\r\ndespised: it tells us that we should obtain a more natural arrangement\r\nby separating the daffodils farther from the lilies.\r\n\r\nIn the first of the three tribes, the classic white lily, the plant\r\npreferred by the insect, takes the chief place; next come the other\r\nlilies and the fritillaries, a diet almost as much sought after; and\r\nlastly the tulips, which the season is too far advanced to allow me to\r\nsubmit for the approval of the Crioceris.\r\n\r\nThe third tribe had a great surprise in store for me. The red\r\nCrioceris fed, though with a very scornful tooth, on the foliage of\r\nthe asparagus, the favourite dish of the Field Crioceris and the\r\nTwelve-spotted Crioceris. On the other hand, she feasted rapturously\r\non the lily of the valley (_Convallaria maialis_) and on Solomon's\r\nseal (_Polygonatum vulgare_), both of which are so different from the\r\nlily to any eye untrained in the niceties of botanical analysis.\r\n\r\nShe did more: she browsed, with every appearance of a contented\r\nstomach, on a prickly creeper, _Smilax aspera_, which tangles itself\r\nin the hedges with its corkscrew tendrils and produces, in the autumn,\r\ngraceful clusters of small red berries, which are used for Christmas\r\ndecorations. The fully-developed leaves are too hard for her, too\r\ntough; she wants the tender tips of the nascent foliage. When I take\r\nthis precaution, I can feed her on the intractable vine as readily as\r\non the lily.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the smilax is accepted gives me confidence in the\r\nprickly butcher's-broom (_Ruscus aculeatus_), another shrub of sturdy\r\nconstitution, admitted to the family rejoicings at Christmas because\r\nof its handsome green leaves and its red berries, which are like big\r\ncoral beads. In order not to discourage the consumer with leaves that\r\nare too hard, I select some young seedlings, newly sprouted and still\r\nbearing the round berry, the nutritive gourd, hanging at their base.\r\nMy precautions lead to nothing: the insect obstinately refuses the\r\nbutcher's-broom, on which I thought that I might rely after the smilax\r\nhad been accepted.\r\n\r\nWe have our botany; the Crioceris has hers, which is subtler in its\r\nappreciation of affinities. Her domain comprises two very natural\r\ngroups, that of the lily and that of the smilax, which, with the\r\nadvance of science, has become the family of the Smilaceae. In these\r\ntwo groups she recognizes certain genera--the more numerous--as her\r\nown; she refuses the others, which ought perhaps to be revised before\r\nbeing finally classified.\r\n\r\nAn exclusive taste for the asparagus, one of the foremost\r\nrepresentatives of the Smilaceae, characterizes the two other\r\nCrioceres, those eager exploiters of the cultivated asparagus. I find\r\nthem also pretty often on the needle-leaved asparagus (_A.\r\nacutifolius_), a forbidding-looking shrub with long, flexible stems\r\nbearing many branches, which the Provencal vine-grower uses, under the\r\nname of _roumieu_, as a filter before the tap of the wine-vat, to\r\nprevent the refuse of the grapes from choking up the vent-hole. Apart\r\nfrom these two plants, the two Crioceres refuse absolutely everything,\r\neven when in July they come up from the earth with the famishing\r\nstomachs which the long fast of the metamorphosis has given them. On\r\nthe same wild asparagus, disdainful of the rest, lives a fourth\r\nCrioceris (_C. paracenthesia_), the smallest of the group. I do not\r\nknow enough of her habits to say anything more about her.\r\n\r\nThese botanical details tell us that the Crioceres, which hatch early,\r\nin the middle of summer, have no reason to fear famine. If the\r\nLily-beetle can no longer find her favourite plant, she can browse\r\nupon Solomon's seal and smilax, not to mention the lily of the valley\r\nand, I dare say, a few others of the same family. The other three are\r\nmore favoured. Their food-plant remains erect, green and well provided\r\nwith leaves until the end of autumn. The wild asparagus even,\r\nundaunted by the extreme cold, maintains a sturdy existence all the\r\nyear round. Belated resources, moreover, are superfluous. After a\r\nbrief period of summer freedom, the various Crioceres seek their\r\nwinter quarters and go to earth under the dead leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\nTHE CLYTHRAE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lily-beetle dresses herself: with her ordure she makes herself a\r\ncosy gown, an infamous garment, it is true, but an excellent\r\nprotection against parasites and sunstroke. The weaver of faecal cloth\r\nhas hardly any imitators. The Hermit-crab dresses himself: he selects\r\nto fit him, from the discarded wardrobe of the Sea-snail, an empty\r\nshell, damaged by the waves; he slips his poor abdomen, which is\r\nincapable of hardening, inside it and leaves outside his great fists\r\nof unequal size, clad in stone boxing-gloves. This is yet another\r\nexample rarely followed.\r\n\r\nWith a few exceptions, all the more remarkable because they are so\r\nrare, the animal, in fact, is not burdened by the need of clothing\r\nitself. Endowed, without having to manufacture a thing, with all that\r\nit wants, it knows nothing of the art of adding defensive extras to\r\nits natural covering.\r\n\r\nThe bird has no need to take thought of its plumage, the furry beast\r\nof its coat, the reptile of its scales, the Snail of his shell, the\r\nGround-beetle of his jerkin. They display no ingenuity with the object\r\nof securing protection from the inclemencies of the atmosphere. Hair,\r\ndown, scales, mother-of-pearl and other items of the animal's apparel:\r\nthese are all produced of their own accord, on an automatic loom.\r\n\r\nMan, for his part, is naked; and the severities of the climate oblige\r\nhim to wear an artificial skin to protect his own. This poverty has\r\ngiven rise to one of our most attractive industries.\r\n\r\nHe invented clothing who, shivering with cold, first thought of\r\nflaying the Bear and covering his shoulders with the brute's hide. In\r\na distant future this primitive cloak was gradually to be replaced by\r\ncloth, the product of our industry. But under a mild sky the\r\ntraditional fig-leaf, the screen of modesty, was for a long while\r\nsufficient. Among peoples remote from civilization, it still suffices\r\nin our day, together with its ornamental complement, the fish-bone\r\nthrough the cartilage of the nose, the red feather in the hair, the\r\nstring round the loins. We must not forget the smear of rancid butter,\r\nwhich serves to keep off the Mosquito and reminds us of the unguent\r\nemployed by the grub that dreads the Tachina.\r\n\r\nIn the first rank of the animals protected against the bite of the\r\natmosphere without the intervention of a handicraft are those which go\r\nclad in hair, dressed free of cost in fleeces, furs or pelts. Some of\r\nthese natural coats are magnificent, surpassing our downiest velvets\r\nin softness.\r\n\r\nDespite the progress of weaving, man is still jealous of them. To-day,\r\nas in the ages when he sheltered under a rock, he values furs greatly\r\nfor the winter. At all seasons he holds them in high esteem as\r\nornamental accessories; he glories in sewing on his attire a shred of\r\nsome wretched flayed beast. The ermine of kings and judges, the white\r\nrabbit-tails with which the university graduate adorns his left\r\nshoulder on solemn occasions carry us back in thought to the age of\r\nthe cave-dwellers.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the fleecy animals still clothe us in a less primitive\r\nfashion. Our woollens are made of hairs interlaced. Ever since the\r\nbeginning, without hoping to find anything better, man has clothed\r\nhimself at the expense of the hairy orders of creation.\r\n\r\nThe bird, a more active producer of heat, whose maintenance is a more\r\ndelicate matter, covers itself with feathers, which overlap evenly,\r\nand puts round its body a thick cushion of air on a bed of down. It\r\nhas on its tail a pot of cosmetic, a bottle of hair-oil, a fatty gland\r\nfrom which the beak obtains an ointment wherewith it preens the\r\nfeathers one by one and renders them impermeable to moisture. A great\r\nexpender of energy by reason of the exigencies of flight, it is\r\nessentially, chilly creature that it is, better-adapted than any other\r\nto the retention of heat.\r\n\r\nFor the slow-moving reptile the scales suffice, preserving it from\r\nhurtful contacts, but playing hardly any part as a bulwark against\r\nchanges of temperature.\r\n\r\nIn its liquid environment, which is far more constant than the air,\r\nthe fish requires no more. Without effort on its part, without violent\r\nexpenditure of motor force, the swimmer is borne up by the mere\r\npressure of the water. A bath whose temperature varies but little\r\nenables it to live in ignorance of excessive cold or heat.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, the mollusc, for the most part a denizen of the seas,\r\nleads a blissful life in its shell, which is a defensive fortress\r\nrather than a garment. Lastly the crustacean confines itself to making\r\na suit of armour out of its mineral skin.\r\n\r\nIn all these, from the hairy to the crustaceous, the real coat, the\r\ncoat turned out by a special industry, does not exist. Hair, fur,\r\nfeather, scale, shell, stony armour require no intervention of the\r\nwearer; they are natural products, not the artificial creations of the\r\nanimal. To find clothiers able to place upon their backs that which\r\ntheir organization refuses them, we must descend from man to certain\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nRidiculous attire, of which we are so proud, made from the slaver of a\r\ncaterpillar or the fleece of a silly sheep: among its inventors the\r\nfirst and foremost is the Crioceris-larva, with its jacket of dung! In\r\nthe art of clothing itself, it preceded the Eskimo, who scrapes the\r\nbowels of the seal to make himself a suit of dittos; it forestalled\r\nour ancestor the troglodyte, who borrowed the fur-coat of his\r\ncontemporary the Cave-bear. We had not got beyond the fig-leaf, when\r\nthe Crioceris already excelled in the manufacture of homespun, both\r\nproviding the raw material and piecing it together.\r\n\r\nFor reasons of economy and easy acquisition, its disgusting method,\r\nbut with very elegant modifications, suits the clan of the Clythrae\r\nand Cryptocephali, those pretty and magnificently coloured Beetles.\r\nTheir larva, a naked little grub, makes itself a long, narrow pot, in\r\nwhich it lives just like the Snail in his shell. As a coat and as a\r\ndwelling the timid creature makes use of a jar, better still, of a\r\ngraceful vase, the product of its industry.\r\n\r\nOnce inside, it never comes out. If anything alarms it, with a sudden\r\nrecoil it withdraws completely into its urn, the opening of which is\r\nclosed with the disk formed by the flat top of the head. When quiet is\r\nrestored, it ventures to put out its head and the three segments with\r\nlegs to them, but is very careful to keep the rest, which is more\r\ndelicate and fastened to the back, inside.\r\n\r\nWith tiny steps, weighted by the burden, it makes its way along,\r\nlifting its earthenware container behind it in a slanting position. It\r\nmakes one think of Diogenes, dragging his house, a terra-cotta tub,\r\nabout with him. The thing is rather unwieldy, because of the weight,\r\nand is liable to heel over, owing to the excessive height of the\r\ncentre of gravity. It makes progress all the same, tilting like a\r\nbusby rakishly cocked over one ear. One of our Land-snails, the\r\nBulimus, whose shell is continued into a turret, moves almost in the\r\nsame fashion, tumbling repeatedly as he goes.\r\n\r\nThe Clythra's is a shapely jar and does credit to the insect's art of\r\npottery. It is firm to the touch, of earthy appearance and smooth as\r\nstucco inside, while the outside is relieved by delicate diagonal,\r\nsymmetrical ribs, which are the traces of successive enlargements. The\r\nback part is slightly dilated and is rounded off at the end with two\r\nslight bumps. These two terminal projections, with the central furrow\r\nwhich divides them, and the ribs marking additions, which match on\r\neither side, are evidence of work done in two parts, in which the\r\nartist has followed the rules of symmetry, the first condition of the\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nThe front part is of rather smaller diameter and is cut off on a\r\nslant, which enables the jar to be lifted and supported on the larva's\r\nback as it moves. Lastly, the mouth is circular, with a blunt edge.\r\n\r\nAny one finding one of these jars for the first time, among the stones\r\nat the foot of an oak, and wondering what its origin could be, would\r\nbe greatly puzzled. Is it the stone of some unknown fruit, emptied of\r\nits kernel by the patient tooth of the Field-mouse? Is it the capsule\r\nof a plant, from which the lid has dropped, allowing the seeds to\r\nfall? It has all the accuracy, all the elegance of the masterpieces of\r\nthe vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nAfter learning the origin of the object, he would be no less doubtful\r\nas to the nature of the materials, or rather of their cement. Water\r\nwill not soften, will not disintegrate the shell. This must be so,\r\nelse the first shower of rain would reduce the grub's garment to pulp.\r\nFire does not affect it greatly either. When exposed to the flame of a\r\ncandle, the jar, without changing shape, loses its brown colour and\r\nassumes the tint of burnt ferruginous earth. The groundwork of the\r\nmaterial therefore is of a mineral nature. It remains for us to\r\ndiscover what the cement can be that gives the earthy element its\r\nbrown colour, holds it together and makes it solid.\r\n\r\nThe grub is ever on its guard. At the least flurry, it shrinks into\r\nits shell and does not budge for a long time. Let us be as patient as\r\nthe grub. We shall surely, some day or other, manage to surprise it at\r\nwork. And indeed I do. It suddenly backs into its jar, disappearing\r\ninside entirely. In a moment it reappears, carrying a brown pellet in\r\nits mandibles. It kneads the pellet and works it up with a little\r\nearth gathered on the threshold of its dwelling; it softens the\r\nmixture as required and then spreads it artistically in a thin strip\r\non the edge of the sheath.\r\n\r\nThe legs take no part in the job. Only the mandibles and the palpi\r\nwork, acting as tub, trowel, beater and roller in one.\r\n\r\nOnce more the grub backs into its shell: once more it returns,\r\nbringing a second clod, which is prepared and used in the same manner.\r\nFive or six times over, it repeats the process, until the whole\r\ncircumference of the mouth has been increased by the addition of a\r\nrim.\r\n\r\nThe potter's compound, as we have seen, consists of two ingredients.\r\nOne of these, the first earth that comes to hand, is collected on the\r\nthreshold of the workshop; the other is fetched from inside the pot,\r\nfor, each time that the grub returns, I see it carrying a brown pellet\r\nin its teeth. What does it keep in the back-shop? Though we can\r\nscarcely find out by direct observation, we can at least guess.\r\n\r\nObserve that the jar is absolutely closed behind, without the smallest\r\nwaste-pipe by which the physiological needs from which the grub is\r\ncertainly not immune can be relieved. The grub is boxed in and never\r\nstirs out of doors. What becomes of its excretions? Well, they are\r\nevacuated at the bottom of the pot. By a gentle movement of the rump,\r\nthe product is spread upon the walls, strengthening the coat and\r\ngiving it a velvet lining.\r\n\r\nIt is better than a lining; it is a precious store of putty. When the\r\ngrub wants to repair its shell or to enlarge it to fit its figure,\r\nwhich increases daily, it proceeds to clean out its cess-pool. It\r\nturns round and, with the tips of its mandibles, collects singly, from\r\nthe back, the brown pellets which it has only to work up with a little\r\nearth to make a ceramic paste of the highest quality.\r\n\r\nObserve also that the grub's pottery is shaped like the legs of our\r\npeg-top trousers and is wider inside than at the opening. This\r\nexcessive girth has its obvious use. It enables the animal to bend and\r\nturn when the contents of the cess-pit are needed for a fresh course\r\nof masonry.\r\n\r\nA garment should be neither too short nor too tight. It is not enough\r\nto add a piece which lengthens it as the body grows longer; we must\r\nalso see that it has sufficient fulness not to hamper the wearer and\r\nto give him liberty of movement.\r\n\r\nThe Snail and all the molluscs with turbinate shells increase the\r\ndiameter of their corkscrew staircase by degrees, so that the last\r\nwhorl is always an exact measure of their actual condition. The lower\r\nwhorls, those of childhood, when they become too narrow, are not\r\nabandoned, it is true; they become lumber-rooms in which the organs of\r\nleast importance to active life find shelter, drawn out into a slender\r\nappendage. The essential portion of the animal is lodged in the upper\r\nstory, which increases in capacity.\r\n\r\nThe big Broken Bulimus, that lover of crumbling walls and limestone\r\nrocks leaning in the sun, sacrifices the graces of symmetry to\r\nutility. When the lower spirals are no longer wide enough, he abandons\r\nthem altogether and moves higher up, into the spacious staircase of\r\nrecent formation. He closes the occupied part with a stout\r\npartition-wall at the back; then, dashing against the sharp stones, he\r\nchips off the superfluous portion, the hovel not fit to live in. The\r\nbroken shell loses its accurate form in the process, but gains in\r\nlightness.\r\n\r\nThe Clythra does not employ the Bulimus' method. It also disdains that\r\nof our dressmakers, who split the overtight garment and let in a piece\r\nof suitable width between the edges of the opening. To break the jar\r\nwhen it becomes too small would be a wilful waste of material; to\r\nsplit it lengthwise and increase its capacity by inserting a strip\r\nwould be an imprudent expedient, which would expose the occupant to\r\ndanger during the slow work of repair. The hermit of the jar can do\r\nbetter than that. It knows how to enlarge its gown while leaving it,\r\nexcept for its fulness, as it was before.\r\n\r\nIts paradoxical method is this: of the lining it makes cloth, bringing\r\nto the outside what was inside. Little by little, as the need makes\r\nitself felt, the grub scrapes and strips the interior of its cell.\r\nReduced to a soft paste by means of a little putty furnished by the\r\nintestine, the scrapings are applied over the whole of the outer\r\nsurface, down to the far end, which the grub, thanks to its perfect\r\nflexibility, is able to reach without taking too much trouble or\r\nleaving its house.\r\n\r\nThis turning of the coat is accomplished with a delicate precision\r\nwhich preserves the symmetrical arrangement of the ornamental ridges;\r\nlastly, it increases the capacity by a gradual transfer of the\r\nmaterial from the inside to the outside. This method of renewing the\r\nold coat is so accurate that nothing is thrown aside, nothing treated\r\nas useless, not even the baby-wear, which remains encrusted in the\r\nkeystone at the original top of the structure.\r\n\r\nIf fresh materials were not added, obviously the jar would gain in\r\nsize at the cost of thickness. The shell would become too thin, by\r\ndint of being turned in order to make space, and would sooner or later\r\nlack the requisite solidity. The grub guards against that. It has in\r\nfront of it as much earth as it can wish for; it keeps putty in a\r\nback-shop; and the factory which produces it never slacks work. There\r\nis nothing to prevent it from thickening the structure at will and\r\nadding as much material as it thinks proper to the inner scrapings\r\nfrom the shell.\r\n\r\nInvariably clad in a garment that is an exact fit, neither too loose\r\nnor too tight, the grub, when the cold weather comes, closes the mouth\r\nof its earthenware jar with a lid of the same mixed compound, a paste\r\nof earth and stercoral cement. It then turns round and makes its\r\npreparations for the metamorphosis, with its head at the back of the\r\npot and its stern near the entrance, which will not be opened again.\r\nIt reaches the adult stage in April and May, when the ilex becomes\r\ncovered with tender shoots, and emerges from its shell by breaking\r\nopen the hinder end. Now come the days of revelry on the leafage, in\r\nthe mild morning sun.\r\n\r\nThe Clythra's jar is a piece of work entailing no little delicacy of\r\nexecution. I can quite well see how the grub lengthens and enlarges\r\nit; but I cannot imagine how it begins it. If it has nothing to serve\r\nas a mould and a base, how does it set to work to assemble the first\r\nlayers of paste into a neatly-shaped cup?\r\n\r\nOur potters have their lathe, the tray which keeps the work rotating\r\nand implements to determine its outline. Could the Clythra, an\r\nexceptional ceramic artist, work without a base and without a guide?\r\nIt strikes me as an insurmountable difficulty. I know the insect to be\r\ncapable of many remarkable industrial feats; but, before admitting\r\nthat the jar can be based on nothing, we should have to see the\r\nnew-born artist at work. Perhaps it has resources bequeathed to it by\r\nits mother; perhaps the egg presents peculiarities which will solve\r\nthe riddle. Let us rear the insect, collect its eggs; then the pottery\r\nwill tell us the secret of its beginnings.\r\n\r\nI install three species of Clythrae under wire-gauze covers, each with\r\na bed of sand and a bottle of water containing a few young\r\nilex-shoots, which I renew as and when they fade. All three species\r\nare common on the holm-oak: they are the Long-legged Clythra (_C.\r\nlongipes_, FAB.), the Four-spotted Clythra (_C. quadripunctata_,\r\nLIN.), and the Taxicorn Clythra (_C. taxicornis_, FAB.).\r\n\r\nI set up a second menagerie with some Cryptocephali, who are closely\r\nrelated to the Clythrae. The inmates are the Ilex Cryptocephalus (_C.\r\nilicis_, OLIV.), the Two-spotted Cryptocephalus (_C. bipunctatus_,\r\nLIN.) and the Golden Cryptocephalus (_C. hypochoeridis_, LIN.), who\r\nwears a resplendent costume. For the first two I provide sprigs of\r\nilex; for the third, the heads of a centaury (_Centaurea aspera_),\r\nwhich is the favourite plant of this living gem.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing striking in the habits of my captives, who spend the\r\nmorning very quietly, the first five browsing on their oak-leaves and\r\nthe sixth on her centaury-blooms. When the sun grows hot, they fly\r\nfrom the bunch of leaves in the centre to the wire trellis and back\r\nfrom the trellis to the leaves, or wander about the top of the cage in\r\na state of great excitement.\r\n\r\nEvery moment couples are formed. They pester each other, pair without\r\npreliminaries, part without regrets and begin elsewhere all over\r\nagain. Life is sweet; and there are enough for all to choose from.\r\nSeveral are persistent. Mounted on the back of the patient female, who\r\nlowers her head and seems untouched by the passionate storm, they\r\nshake her violently. Thus do the amorous insects declare their flame\r\nand win the consent of the hesitating fair.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the couple now tells us the use of a certain organic\r\ndetail peculiar to the Clythra. In several species, though not in all,\r\nthe males' fore-legs are of inordinate length. What is the object of\r\nthese extravagant arms, these curious grappling-irons out of all\r\nproportion to the insect's size? The Grasshoppers and Locusts prolong\r\ntheir hind-legs into levers to assist them in leaping. There is\r\nnothing of the sort here: it is the fore-legs which are exaggerated;\r\nand their excessive length has nothing to do with locomotion. The\r\ninsect, whether resting or walking, seems even to be embarrassed by\r\nthese outrageous stilts, which it bends awkwardly and tucks away as\r\nbest it can, not knowing exactly what to do with them.\r\n\r\nBut wait for the pairing; and the extravagant becomes reasonable. The\r\ncouple take up their pose in the form of a T. The male, standing\r\nperpendicularly, or nearly, represents the cross-piece and the female\r\nthe shaft of the letter, lying on its side. To steady his attitude,\r\nwhich is so contrary to the usual position in pairing, the male flings\r\nout his long grappling-hooks, two sheet-anchors which grip the\r\nfemale's shoulders, the fore-edge of her corselet, or even her head.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the only moment that counts in the adult insect's\r\nlife, it is a good thing indeed to possess long arms, long hands, like\r\n_Clythra longimana_ and _C. longipes_, as the scientific nomenclature\r\ncalls them. Although their names are silent on the subject, the\r\nTaxicorn Clythra and the Six-spotted Clythra (_C. sexmaculata_, FAB.)\r\nand many others also have recourse to the same means of equilibrium:\r\ntheir fore-legs are utterly exaggerated.\r\n\r\nIs the difficulty of pairing in a transversal position the explanation\r\nof the long grappling-irons thrown out to a distance? We will not be\r\ntoo certain, for here is the Four-spotted Clythra, who would flatly\r\ncontradict us. The male has fore-legs of modest dimensions, in\r\nconformity with the usual rules; he places himself crosswise like the\r\nothers and nevertheless achieves his ends without hindrance. He finds\r\nit enough to modify slightly the gymnastics of his embrace. The same\r\nmay be said of the different Cryptocephali, who all have stumpy limbs.\r\nWherever we look, we find special resources, known to some and unknown\r\nto others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\nTHE CLYTHRAE: THE EGG\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us leave the long-armed and short-armed to pursue their amorous\r\ncontests as they please and come to the egg, the main object of my\r\ninsect-rearing. The Taxicorn Clythra is the first in the field; I see\r\nher at working during the last days of May. A most singular and\r\ndisconcerting batch of eggs is hers! Is it really a group of eggs? I\r\nhesitate until I surprise the mother using her hind-legs to finish\r\nextracting the strange germ which issues slowly and perhaps\r\nlaboriously from her oviduct.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed the Taxicorn Clythra's batch. Assembled in bundles of one\r\nto three dozen and each fastened by a slender transparent thread\r\nslightly longer than itself, the eggs form a sort of inverted umbel,\r\nwhich dangles sometimes from the trelliswork of the cover, sometimes\r\nfrom the leaves of the twigs that provide the grub with food. The\r\nbunch of grains quivers at the least breath.\r\n\r\nWe know the egg-cluster of the Hemerobius, the object of so many\r\nmistakes to the untrained observer. The little Lace-winged Fly with\r\nthe gold eggs sets up on a leaf a group of long, tiny columns as fine\r\nas a spider's thread, each bearing an egg as a capital. The whole\r\nresembles pretty closely a tuft of some long-stemmed mildew. Remember\r\nalso the Eumenes' hanging egg,[1] which swings at the end of a thread,\r\nthus protecting the grub when it takes its first mouthfuls of the heap\r\nof dangerous game. The Taxicorn Clythra provides us with a third\r\nexample of eggs fitted with suspension-threads, but so far nothing has\r\ngiven me an inkling of the function or the use of this string. Though\r\nthe mother's intentions escape me, I can at least describe her work in\r\nsome detail.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Cf. _The Mason-wasps_: chap. i.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThe eggs are smooth, coffee-coloured and shaped like a thimble. If you\r\nhold them to the light, you see in the thickness of their skin five\r\ncircular zones, darker than the rest and producing almost the same\r\neffect as the hoops of a barrel. The end attached to the\r\nsuspension-thread is slightly conical; the other is lopped off\r\nabruptly and the section is hollowed into a circular mouth. A good\r\nlens shows us inside this, a little below the rim, a fine white\r\nmembrane, as smooth as the skin of a drum.\r\n\r\nIn addition, from the edge of the orifice there rises a wide\r\nmembranous tab, whitish and delicate, which might be taken for a\r\nraised lid. Nevertheless there is no raising of a lid after the eggs\r\nare laid. I have seen the egg leave the oviduct; it is then what it\r\nwill be later, but lighter in colour. No matter: I cannot believe that\r\nso complicated a machine can make its way, with all sail set, through\r\nthe maternal straits. I imagine that the lid-like appendage remains\r\nlowered, closing the mouth, until the moment when the egg sees the\r\nlight. Then and not till then does it rise.\r\n\r\nGuided by the rather less complex structure of the eggs of the other\r\nClythrae and of the Cryptocephali, I think of trying to take the\r\nstrange germ to pieces; and I succeed after a fashion. Under the\r\ncoffee-coloured sheath, which forms a little five-hooped barrel, is a\r\nwhite membrane. This is what we see through the mouth and what I\r\ncompared with the skin of a drum. I recognize it as the regulation\r\ntunic, the usual envelope of any insect's egg. The rest, the little\r\nbrown barrel, broached at one end and bearing a raised lid, must\r\ntherefore be an accessory integument, a sort of exceptional shell, of\r\nwhich I do not as yet know any other example.\r\n\r\nThe Long-legged Clythra and the Four-spotted Clythra know nothing of\r\npacking their eggs in long-stemmed bundles. In June, from the height\r\nof the branches in which they are grazing, both of them carelessly\r\nallow their eggs to drop to the ground, one by one, here and there, at\r\nrandom and at long intervals, without giving the least thought to\r\ntheir installation. They might be little grains of excrement, unworthy\r\nof interest and ejected at hazard. The egg-factory and the\r\ndung-factory scatter their products with the same indifference.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, let us bring the lens to bear upon the minute particle\r\nso contumeliously treated. It is a miracle of elegance. In both\r\nspecies of Clythrae the eggs have the form of truncated ellipsoids,\r\nmeasuring about a millimetre in length.[2] The Long-legged Clythra's\r\nare a very dark brown and remind one of a thimble, a comparison which\r\nis the more exact inasmuch as they are dented with quadrangular pits,\r\narranged in spiral series which cross one another with exquisite\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: .039 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]\r\n\r\nThose of the Four-spotted Clythra are pale in colour. They are covered\r\nwith convex scales, overlapping in diagonal rows, ending in a point at\r\nthe lower extremity, which is free and more or less askew. This\r\ncollection of scales has rather the appearance of a hop-cone. Surely a\r\nvery curious egg, ill-adapted to gliding gently through the narrow\r\npassages of the ovaries. I feel sure that it does not bristle in this\r\nfashion when it descends the delicate natal sheath; it is near the end\r\nof the oviduct that it receives its coat of scales.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the three Cryptocephali reared in my cages, the eggs\r\nare laid later; their season is the end of June and July. As in the\r\nClythrae, there is the same lack of maternal care, the same hap-hazard\r\ndropping of the seeds from the centaury-blossoms and the ilex-twigs.\r\nThe general form of the egg is still that of a truncated ellipsoid.\r\nThe ornaments vary. In the eggs of the Golden Cryptocephalus and the\r\nIlex Cryptocephalus they consist of eight flattened, wavy ribs,\r\nwinding corkscrew-wise; in those of the Two-spotted Cryptocephalus\r\nthey take the form of spiral rows of pits.\r\n\r\nWhat can this envelope be, so remarkable for its elegance, with its\r\nspiral mouldings, its thimble-pits and its hop-scales? A few little\r\naccidental facts put me on the right track. To begin with, I acquire\r\nthe certainty that the egg does not descend from the ovaries as I find\r\nit on the ground. Its ornamentation, incompatible with a gentle\r\ngliding movement, had already told me as much; I now have a clear\r\nproof.\r\n\r\nMingled with the normal eggs of both the Golden Cryptocephalus and the\r\nLong-legged Clythra, I find others which differ in no respect from the\r\nusual run of insects' eggs. The eggs are perfectly smooth, with a\r\nsoft, pale-yellow shell. As the cage contains no other insects than\r\nthe Clythra under consideration or the Cryptocephalus, I cannot be\r\nmistaken as to the origin of my finds.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if any doubts remained, they would be dispelled by the\r\nfollowing evidence: in addition to the bare, yellow eggs there are\r\nsome whose base is set in a tiny brown, pitted cup, obviously the work\r\nof either the Two-spotted Cryptocephalus or the Long-legged Clythra,\r\naccording to the cage, but unfinished work, which half-clothed the\r\negg, as it left the ovaries, and then, when the dress-material ran\r\nshort, or something went wrong with the machinery, allowed it to cross\r\nthe outer threshold in the likeness of an acorn fixed in its cup.\r\n\r\nNothing could be prettier than this yellow egg, standing in its\r\nartistic egg-cup. Nor could anything tell us more conclusively where\r\nthe jewel is manufactured. It is in the cloaca, the chamber common to\r\nthe oviduct and the intestine, that the bird wraps its egg in a\r\ncalcareous shell, often decorating it with magnificent hues:\r\nolive-green for the Nightingale, sky-blue for the Wheatear, soft pink\r\nfor the Icterine Warbler. It is in the cloaca also that the Clythra\r\nand the Cryptocephalus produce the elegant armour of their eggs.\r\n\r\nIt remains to decide upon the material employed. From its horny\r\nappearance there is reason to believe that the little barrel of the\r\nTaxicorn Clythra and the scales of the Four-spotted Clythra are the\r\nproducts of a special secretion; and, now that it is too late, I much\r\nregret that I neglected to look for the apparatus yielding this\r\nsecretion in the neighbourhood of the cloaca. As for the thing so\r\nprettily wrought by the Long-legged Clythra and the Cryptocephali, let\r\nus admit without false shame that it is made of faecal matter.\r\n\r\nThe proof is furnished by certain specimens, by no means rare in the\r\nGolden Cryptocephalus, in which the customary brown is replaced by an\r\nunmistakable green, the sign of a vegetable pulp. In course of time,\r\nthese green eggs turn brown and become like the others, no doubt by\r\nreason of an oxidization which alters the natural qualities of the\r\ndigestive product still further. The egg, entering the cloaca in a\r\nsoft and utterly naked state, receives an artistic coat of the\r\nintestinal dross, even as the Hen's egg is covered by a shell formed\r\nof the chalky secretions.\r\n\r\n_Materiem superabat opus, nam Mulciber illic\r\nAEquora celerat_,\r\n\r\nsaid Ovid, in his description of the Palace of the Sun. The poet had\r\nprecious metals and gems wherewith to build his imaginary marvel. What\r\nhas the Clythra wherewith to achieve its ideal jewel? It has the\r\nshameful material whose name is banished from decent speech. And which\r\nis the Mulciber, the Vulcan, the artist-engraver that engraves the\r\ncovering of the egg so prettily? It is the terminal sewer. The cloaca\r\nrolls the material, flutes it, twists it into spirals, decks it with\r\nchains of little pits and makes it up into a scaly suit of armour,\r\nshowing how nature laughs at our paltry standards of value and how\r\nwell able she is to convert the sordid into the beautiful.\r\n\r\nIn the bird, the egg-shell is a temporary defensive cell which at\r\nhatching-time is broken and abandoned and is henceforth useless. Made\r\nof horny matter or stercoral paste, the shell of the Clythra and the\r\nCryptocephalus is, on the contrary, a permanent refuge, which the\r\ninsect will never leave so long as it remains a larva. Here the grub\r\nis born with a ready-made garment, of rare elegance and an exact fit,\r\na garment which it only has to enlarge, little by little, in the\r\noriginal manner described above. The shell, shaped like a little\r\nbarrel or thimble, is open in front. There is nothing therefore to\r\nbreak, nothing to cast aside at the moment of hatching, except perhaps\r\nthe actual envelope of the egg. Directly this membrane is burst, the\r\ntiny creature is free, with a handsome carved jacket, a legacy from\r\nits mother.\r\n\r\nLet us indulge in a crazy dream and imagine young birds which keep the\r\negg-shell intact, save for an opening through which they pass their\r\nhead, and which, all their lives long, remain clad in this shell, on\r\ncondition that they themselves enlarge it as they grow. This absurd\r\ndream is realized by our grub: it is dressed in the shell of its egg,\r\nexpanded by degrees as the grub itself grows bigger.\r\n\r\nIn July all my collection of eggs are hatched, each isolated in a\r\nlarge cup covered with a slip of glass which will moderate the\r\nevaporation. What an interesting family! My vermin are swarming amid\r\nthe miscellaneous vegetable refuse with which I have furnished the\r\npremises. They all move along with tiny steps, dragging their shells,\r\nwhich they carry lifted on a slant; they come halfway out and suddenly\r\npop in again; they tumble over if they merely attempt to scale a sprig\r\nof moss, pick themselves up again, forge ahead and cast about at\r\nrandom.\r\n\r\nHunger, we can no longer doubt, is the cause of this agitation. What\r\nshall I give my famished nurselings? They are vegetarians: there can\r\nbe no doubt whatever about that; but this is not enough to settle the\r\nbill of fare. What would happen under the natural conditions? Rearing\r\nthe insects in cages, I find the eggs scattered at random on the\r\nground. The mother drops them carelessly, here and there, from the top\r\nof the bough where she is refreshing herself by soberly notching some\r\ntender leaf. The Taxicorn Clythra fits a long stalk to her eggs and\r\nfixes them in clusters on the foliage. While I cannot yet make up my\r\nmind, in the absence of direct observation, whether the new-born larva\r\ncuts the suspension-thread itself, or whether the thread is broken\r\nmerely as a result of drying up, sooner or later these eggs are lying\r\non the ground, like the others.\r\n\r\nThe same thing must happen outside my cages: the eggs of the Clythrae\r\nand the Cryptocephali are scattered over the ground beneath the tree\r\nor plant on which the adult feeds.\r\n\r\nNow what do we find under the shelter of the oak? Turf, dead leaves,\r\nmore or less pickled by decay, dry twigs cased in lichens, broken\r\nstones with cushions of moss and, lastly, mould, the final residue of\r\nvegetable matters wrought upon by time. Under the tufts of the\r\ncentaury on which the Golden Cryptocephalus browses lies a black bed\r\nof the miscellaneous refuse of the plant.\r\n\r\nI try a little of everything, but nothing answers my expectations very\r\npositively. I observe, nevertheless, that a few disdainful mouthfuls\r\nare taken, a little bit here, a little bit there, enough to tell me\r\nthe nature of the first layers which the grub adds to its natal\r\nsheath. With the exception of the Taxicorn Clythra, whose egg, with\r\nits suspension-stalk, seems to denote rather special habits, I see my\r\nseveral charges begin to prolong their shell with a brown paste,\r\nsimilar in appearance to that with whose manufacture and employment we\r\nare already familiar.\r\n\r\nDiscouraged by a food which does not suit them and perhaps also tried\r\nby a season of exceptional drouth, my young potters soon relinquish\r\ntheir task; they die after adding a shallow rim to their pots.\r\n\r\nOnly the Long-legged Clythra thrives and repays me amply for my\r\ntroublesome nursing. I provide it with chips of old bark taken from\r\nthe first tree to hand, the oak, the olive, the fig-tree and many\r\nothers. I soften them by steeping them for a short time in water. The\r\ncork-like crusts, however, are not what my boarders eat. The actual\r\nfood, the butter on the bread, is on the surface. There is a little\r\nhere of all that the first beginnings of vegetable life add to old\r\ntree-trunks, all that breaks up decrepit age to turn it into perpetual\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nThere are tufts of moss, hardly a twelfth of an inch in height, which\r\nwere sleeping droughtily under the merciless sun of the dog-days, but\r\nwhich a bath in a glass of water awakens at once. They now display\r\ntheir ring of green leaflets, brightened up and restored to life for a\r\nfew hours. There are leprous efflorescences, with their white or\r\nyellow dust; tiny lichens radiating in ash-grey straps and covered\r\nwith glaucous, white-edged shields, great round eyes that seem to gaze\r\nfrom the depths of the limbo in which dead matter comes to life again.\r\nThere are collemas, which, after a shower, become dark and bloated and\r\nshake like jellies; sphaerias, whose pustules stand out like ebony\r\nteats, full of myriads of tiny sacs, each containing eight pretty\r\nseeds. A glance through the microscope at the contents of one of these\r\nteats, a speck only just visible to the eye, reveals an astounding\r\nworld: an infinity of procreative wealth in an atom. Ah, what a\r\nbeautiful thing life is, even on a chip of rotten bark no bigger than\r\na finger-nail! What a garden! What a treasure-house!\r\n\r\nThis is the best pasture put to the test. My Clythrae graze upon it,\r\ngathering in dense herds at the most luxuriant spots. One would take\r\nthis heap for pinches of some brown, modelled seed or other, the\r\nsnapdragon's, for instance; but these particular seeds push and sway;\r\nif one of them moves the least bit, the shells all clash together.\r\nOthers wander about, in search of a good place, staggering and\r\ntumbling under the weight of the overcoat; they wander at random\r\nthrough that great and spacious world, the bottom of my cup.\r\n\r\nNot a fortnight has elapsed before a strip, built up on the rim, has\r\ndoubled the length of the Long-legged Clythra's shell, in order to\r\nmaintain the capacity of the earthenware jar in proportion to the size\r\nof the grub, which has been growing from day to day. The recent\r\nportion, the work of the larva, is very plainly distinguishable from\r\nthe original shell, the product of the mother; it is smooth over its\r\nwhole extent, whereas the rest is ornamented with tiny holes arranged\r\nin spiral rows.\r\n\r\nPlaned away inside as it becomes too tight, the jar grows wider and at\r\nthe same time longer. The dust taken from it, once more kneaded into\r\nmortar, is reapplied outside, more or less everywhere, and forms a\r\nrubble under which the original beauties end by disappearing. The\r\nneatly-pitted masterpiece is swamped by a layer of brown plasterwork;\r\nnot always entirely, however, even when the structure reaches its\r\nfinal dimensions. If we pass an attentive lens between the two humps\r\nat the lower end, we very often see, encrusted in the earthy mass, the\r\nremains of the shell of the egg. This is the potter's mark. The\r\narrangement of the spiral ridges, the number and the shape of the pits\r\nenable us almost to read the name of the maker, Clythra or\r\nCryptocephalus.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first I could not imagine the worker in ceramic paste\r\ndesigning its own pottery by drafting the first outlines. My doubts\r\nwere justified. The grubs of the Clythra and the Cryptocephalus\r\npossess a maternal legacy in the shape of a shell, a garment which\r\nthey have only to enlarge. They are born the owners of a layette which\r\nbecomes the groundwork of their trousseau. They increase it, without,\r\nhowever, imitating its artistic elegance. A more vigorous age discards\r\nthe laces in which the mother delights to clothe the new-born child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nAcarus, 33, 44\r\n\r\nAdder, 294,
