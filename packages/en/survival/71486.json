Plate V, figs. 1–1_c_.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive features of this species are: Surface ornamented with\r\nboth pustules and granules, large interradial supporting plate above\r\ncalyx, ten short, massive arms.\r\n\r\nDescription: Calyx basin-shaped, shallow, quite concave below.\r\nInfrabasals partly covered, but located entirely within the body cavity.\r\nStem small and apparently round. The five basals are large, recurved\r\nbelow the middle, concave in the center of the more depressed part, four\r\napparently hexagonal and one heptagonal, and larger than the others\r\nsupporting the interradial; all higher than wide, sutures not much\r\ndepressed. There are five large, massive radials a trifle more than\r\ntwice as wide as high, well beveled, faceted, and apparently sagging a\r\nlittle on the upper articular surface. Interradial large, fully half\r\nwithin the calyx, higher than broad, and the upper portion very strongly\r\ncurved inward. This plate supports another entirely without the calyx,\r\nwhich is comparatively large and appears to be pentagonal when seen from\r\nwithout, the two upper sides being much longer than the rest, making the\r\nplate appear triangular at first sight, fitting closely between the arms\r\non either side. The five brachial plates are large, contiguous save on\r\nthe posterior side, and produced into an obtuse spinous process. Much of\r\nthe upper surface of these processes is faceted, supporting the costals,\r\nand in this manner giving the animal its greater lateral diameter above\r\nthe calyx, and affording more room for the massive arms which, when\r\nclosed, form a box around the inner part. The costals are ten in number,\r\ntwo to each brachial, large, nearly three times as broad as high, and\r\nconvex. The distichals are sometimes present and sometimes wanting, very\r\nbroad and thin when present. Arms ten, broad, outer surface of each\r\nnearly flat massive, composed of two series of interlocking plates, each\r\none of which bears a pinnule. Pinnulæ long and narrow. The articular\r\nsurface of the arm plates is minutely crenulated. These plates decrease\r\nin length though but little in height as they approach the tips of the\r\narms. The surface of almost the entire animal was ornamented with\r\ngranules, and the lower part with both granules and pustules.\r\n\r\n    Measurements:     height.        breadth.            length.\r\n  Calyx               11    mm.       30  mm.\r\n  Basals (vertical)   5½     „        12   „\r\n  Radials              9     „       18+   „\r\n  Brachials            7     „        17   „       8 mm. beyond calyx.\r\n  Costals              4     „         9 to 11 mm.\r\n  Distichals           2     „         9        „\r\n  Arm plates           2     „         3 to 5   „\r\n  Interradial          7     „         6        „\r\n\r\nAside from the markings mentioned, the calyx is also ornamented with\r\ndepressions which look at first like borings of some kind, but which\r\nhave the same granular character as the rest of the surface.\r\n\r\nPosition and locality: Carboniferous, Upper Coal Measures, Topeka, Kan.,\r\nfrom the Osage City shales, over the Osage coal.\r\n\r\nThe type was collected by Prof. W. A. Harshbarger, in honor of whom it\r\nis named. Type now in the collection of Washburn College.\r\n\r\nIn general appearance this species is strikingly like _C. craigii_\r\nWorthen, but differs in the following respects: The body is not smooth\r\nbut highly ornamented, and the anal piece is much larger. In all\r\nspecimens of _C. craigii_ that I have seen the body is smooth and\r\nglossy, and shows (even when apparently unworn) no indications of former\r\nsurface-markings, while this species possesses both pustules and\r\ngranules, the latter covering about the entire specimen. In mature\r\nindividuals the interradial is much larger. Two smaller specimens,\r\nprobably younger ones of this species, are figured in the accompanying\r\nplate, showing the relative growth of the calyx and interradial. In both\r\nthe ornamentation is the same as described in this species. _C.\r\nmonticulatus_ Beede is from the same locality and horizon, but has long,\r\nslender arms, brachials not spinous, and the calyx is deeper. The most\r\nfundamental difference, however, is the number of arms possessed by the\r\nlatter species, the number being sixteen or eighteen, while the one here\r\ndescribed has but ten.\r\n\r\n_C. nodulifera_ Butts differs from this species in having a node at the\r\nupper part of each basal and also on the radials. It also has more acute\r\nand apparently longer spines. Mr. Butts makes no mention of finer\r\nsurface-markings. The Topeka specimen is from a much higher horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Aviculopecten subequivalvus=, n. sp. Plate V, figs. 3, 3_a_.\r\n\r\nShell thick, moderately large, subequivalvular, rather convex, quite\r\noblique, ears well developed. The hinge is nearly straight, the beak\r\ndoes not project, the angle of divergence of its sides is about eighty\r\nto ninety degrees. The left valve, exclusive of the ears, is ovate;\r\nanterior ear well developed, obtusely angular, marked only by strong\r\nlines of growth; the rise from the ear to the body of the shell is\r\nabrupt; the marginal sinus separating the ear from the rest of the shell\r\nbroad, shallow, and ill-defined. The posterior ear is unknown. The\r\nanterior margin below the ear forms an ovate curve, which is probably\r\ncontinued on the ventral and postero-ventral margins. The surface of\r\nthis valve is apparently marked only by stronger and fainter concentric\r\nlines except on the front and back sides, where there are radiating rows\r\nof vaulted lamellæ. It is entirely probable that these marks once\r\nextended over the entire surface, but have been worn off from the more\r\nconvex portions. Judging from another specimen, the right valve is\r\nsomewhat flatter than the left and quite as oblique. Posterior ear very\r\nsmall and obtuse; anterior ear quite large, marked by obscure, large,\r\nradiating ribs and probably vaulted lamellæ, as well as strong\r\nconcentric markings; separated from the shell by a deep sulcus. Margin\r\nfrom the beak around the posterior to near the middle of the shell is a\r\nregular ovate curve, antero-ventral margin somewhat produced but\r\nrounded, extending obliquely toward the beak until the deep byssal sinus\r\nis reached. Ornamentation as in the other valve. In this specimen it\r\nseems that the radiating rows of scales covered the entire surface\r\nbefore being worn away. Length, 36 mm.; height, 32 mm.; hinge, 17 mm.;\r\nthickness, about 5 mm.\r\n\r\nPosition and locality: Thin limestone, south of Dover, Kan., in Upper\r\nCoal Measures. Type in author’s collection.\r\n\r\nThis shell may prove to be a _Pseudomonotis_, as the critical characters\r\nare not well known. It is not liable to be confused with any other shell\r\nfrom the Coal Measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pinna lata=, n. sp. Plate V, fig. 4.\r\n\r\nShell small for this genus, not very convex, probably plain except the\r\nusual growth marks, acutely pointed at the beaks, which are terminal.\r\nThe angle of divergence of the shell is thirty degrees. This species is\r\nbased on three casts. The type is not distorted, but the posterior end\r\nis broken away. There are two other specimens from the same locality,\r\nbut compressed dorso-ventrically, which show the same characters as the\r\ntype. The size is about that of _Aviculopinna americana_ Meek, but the\r\nform and markings as shown on the cast are very different, and the beaks\r\nare terminal. Length of type along hinge, 27 mm.; height (20 mm. back of\r\nbeak), 11 mm.\r\n\r\nPosition and locality: Carboniferous, Upper Coal Measures, Howard\r\nlimestone, Topeka, Kan.\r\n\r\nThe small size, great angle of divergence at the beak and sharp-pointed\r\nbeaks easily distinguish this species from other members of the genus\r\nfrom the Coal Measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pleurophorus whitei=, n. sp. Plate V, figs. 5, 5_b_.\r\n\r\nPleurophorus —? White, Bull. U. S. Geol. Surv. 77, p. 27, pl. iv, figs.\r\n5–10.\r\n\r\nShell of medium to large size, transversely ovate, with the depth of the\r\nshell greater at the anterior than at the posterior end. Beaks\r\nmoderately prominent, subterminal; umbonal ridge prominent, extending\r\nobliquely to postero-ventral margin. Hinge straight or arcuate, usually\r\nabout three-fourths the length of the specimen. The right posterior\r\nlamina is well shown on good casts. The anterior adductor impression is\r\nusually prominent, being set apart by the depression produced by the\r\nridge behind it. The impression of the two cardinal teeth is also\r\nvisible. The anterior margin drops obliquely downward from the beak\r\nnearly to the middle of the shell, when it rounds, rapidly at first,\r\ninto the ventral margin, which may be straight, somewhat sinuous or even\r\nconvex on approaching the postero-ventral region: at the end of the\r\numbonal ridge it rounds rapidly into the posterior, oblique truncation,\r\nreaching the hinge at an oblique angle. The lines formed by the hinge\r\nand ventral margins converge toward the posterior, thus leaving the\r\ngreatest depth of the shell in front. Above the umbonal ridge the shell\r\nis obliquely flattened to the hinge. The surface, as shown in excellent\r\nmolds, is ornamented only by fine lines of growth, which are sometimes a\r\nlittle stronger beneath the beak than elsewhere, and weaken on and above\r\nthe umbonal slope.\r\n\r\nPosition and locality: This species is found in the Upper Coal Measures,\r\nupper Wabaunsee stage, east of Barrett, Kan. This is the only locality\r\nknown to the writer where this shell, abundant in the Permian, is found\r\nbelow the Wreford limestone. Types from Permian west of Stockdale, Kan.,\r\n“about 100 feet above Cottonwood limestone.” Collected by Prof. E. A.\r\nPopenoe.\r\n\r\nThis species is extremely variable, as shown in Professor White’s\r\nfigures, above cited. The short shell with the posterior shallower than\r\nthe anterior end is in sharp contrast to most of the species of the\r\ngenus. In surface ornamentation it resembles _P. tropidophorus_ more\r\nclosely than any other species. It is distinguished from _P.\r\nsubcuneatus_ Meek by its short, thick form and larger size. This species\r\nis the more abundant of the two in the Permian rocks of the Big Blue\r\nseries, while _P. subcuneata_ only has been identified from the Cimarron\r\nseries.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Allorisma kansasensis=, n. sp. Plate V, figs. 6, 6_d_.\r\n\r\nShell small, rather gibbous, transversely subovate. Beaks prominent,\r\nincurved, approximate, located about one-third the length of the shell\r\nfrom the anterior end. Anterior outline descending obliquely from the\r\nbeaks nearly to the ventral margin, where it turns rather abruptly\r\nbackward along the nearly straight basal edge to the posterior\r\nextremity, where it rounds off regularly upward and then forward to meet\r\nthe hinge. The hinge is apparently straight and more than half as long\r\nas the shell. The umbonal ridge is prominent, rounded, ill-defined,\r\nfading away at the extremity of the shell. Above this ridge is a\r\ndepression which, with the smooth, elevated hinge, would cause a strong\r\nkeel on the shell back of the beaks. The concentric ribs are prominent,\r\nfading out at the upper part of the umbonal ridge and near the anterior\r\nborder. These ribs are quite as prominent on the casts as on the shell\r\nitself. On the central and postero-central regions are the\r\ncharacteristic distant, radiating rows of fine, closely set granules.\r\nThe shell is less convex below and back of the beak than on either side\r\nof this region, though it is not concave. The length varies from 1.7 to\r\n1.4 the height.\r\n\r\nPosition and locality: Upper Coal Measures, Howard limestone, Topeka,\r\nKan.\r\n\r\nThis species is very closely related to _A. curta_ Swallow, but differs\r\nfrom it in having a straighter hinge and a more remote beak. It is from\r\na lower horizon. In the latter respect it differs from McChesney’s\r\nspecies also.\r\n\r\n PALEONTOLOGICAL LABORATORY, INDIANA UNIVERSITY,\r\n                 MAY 22, 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Explanation of Plate V.\r\n\r\n       All figures about natural size.

W. BEEDE.\r\n\r\n                             With Plate VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to the systematic importance and the rarity of good material of\r\nthe brachial framework of the brachiopods, any light on the extent of\r\nindividual variation of these parts is of considerable importance. In\r\nthe spring of 1899 the University of Kansas received from Prof. C. N.\r\nGould a set of ten specimens of _Seminula argentia_ (Shepard) Hall that\r\nshow the position of the spires. These specimens were all from the same\r\nhorizon in the Lower Permian. The University also had another specimen\r\nshowing these characters, as did a specimen in the writer’s collection.\r\nRecently the study of these specimens was taken up and some remarkable\r\nresults developed.\r\n\r\nBoth valves of this species are quite convex and not infrequently as\r\nbroad as long. The older specimens are quite ventricose. However, the\r\nshell is subject to a considerable variation in form. Four of the twelve\r\nspecimens studied were somewhat compressed, but it so happens that three\r\nof these approach the normal type very closely, while the fourth does\r\nnot vary from it greatly. Those showing greatest variation have not been\r\nsubject to any visible external deformation. The specimens under\r\ndiscussion are of about the average size and form.\r\n\r\nThe normal position of the spire is with its apex pointing to the side,\r\nnear the line where the valves meet, at, or a little in front of, the\r\nmiddle of the shell, which is also the widest point. In the central part\r\nof the shell cavity the edges of the spires nearly meet. In front they\r\nflare apart, leaving a large, subcircular opening. For convenience, in\r\nthis paper, this opening will be spoken of as the frontal aperture of\r\nthe spiralia. It will also be necessary to orient the specimens so that\r\ndefinite positions may be referred to. For this purpose we will consider\r\nthe specimens as front toward (back away from) the observer, with the\r\nbrachial valve uppermost.\r\n\r\nA specimen from the Topeka limestone, Upper Coal Measures, at Topeka,\r\nKan., shows the spires with the apex of one of them pointing almost\r\ndirectly forward toward the anterior end of the shell, turned through a\r\nhorizontal angle of about ninety degrees from its normal position,\r\nwhile, as nearly as may be determined from the specimen as cut, the apex\r\nof the other one is directed toward the median line of the pedicle valve\r\njust in front of the hinge. This specimen was selected to be ground,\r\nbecause it was a good specimen, of normal form. Another specimen (No.\r\n3), from the Permian of Cowley county, Kansas, has the apices of the\r\nspires turned at an angle of about forty-five degrees or more in a\r\nvertical direction, causing the point of the spire to be located near\r\nthe middle of the right side of the brachial valve, while the other\r\npoints to the opposite of the pedicle valve. The spire is quite\r\nflattened, approaching disk shape, with the apex quite obtuse and the\r\nfrontal aperture very narrow and almost slit-like (this may be partially\r\ndue to a very slight compression, but the compression, if present, is so\r\nslight as to modify it very little), owing to the position of the spires\r\nin the shell, which prevents their flaring much at the front. The shell\r\nis not an old one, and, for this reason, is somewhat less ventricose\r\nthan many adults. The young specimens are much flatter than the old ones\r\nin this species.\r\n\r\nThe spiralia of No. 10 are turned in a similar manner, but through a\r\nmuch smaller angle. The frontal aperture is typical, as is also the\r\ngeneral form of the shell. The spiralia are conical, and the tips\r\nprobably acute. In No. 6 the position of the spiralia, their form and\r\nthat of the aperture are normal. Nos. 6 and 9 show spines on the spires.\r\nThe spines are closely set, thick, blunt, and nearly twice as long as\r\nbroad. In fact, some appear to be nearly as large at the tips as at the\r\nbase. In No. 9 the spires are normal, except that, instead of being\r\nflaring conical, they are more in the shape of a folded shield shape\r\nwith acute apex. In other words, the frontal aperture is produced by the\r\ndorso-ventral compression of the entire cone rather than the flaring of\r\nthe frontal portion. The apex of the left spire is bent somewhat\r\ndownward. The position of the spiralia in No. 7 is about normal, the\r\ntips obtuse, the spires almost perfectly depressed conical, frontal\r\naperture only slightly wider than the space farther back on the side\r\nnext the brachial valve. No. 5 has apparently been compressed laterally,\r\nthrough this compression did not affect the positions of the spiralia,\r\nfor they are normal. They appear to have been of the typical form in\r\nevery respect. In No. 8 the spires seem to have been turned through a\r\nslight vertical angle, though the incompleteness of the specimen\r\nprevents a close study of position. The form was apparently normal,\r\nexcept that the lower edges may have been somewhat pressed inward. Nos.\r\n1 and 4 are about normal throughout. No. 2 is normal as far as can be\r\nseen, except that the apices are turned through a small vertical angle.\r\nThe anterior portion of the pedicle valve is crushed in. No. 12 is\r\nnormal throughout.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that none of the specimens show the crural attachment\r\nof the spiralia. Such structures must certainly vary in order to support\r\nthe spires in their various positions.\r\n\r\nThe above facts would seem to indicate the following conclusions: First,\r\nin those spire-bearing brachiopods in which the form of the shell does\r\nnot govern the position of the spires, the Athyridæ in particular, the\r\nspires may be subject to a considerable variation in both position and\r\nform. Second, that the crural supports are probably so modified as to\r\naccommodate the spires in their various positions.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the foregoing, it will be seen that in the future it\r\nwill be necessary to study the structure of several specimens before\r\nusing small variations of internal structure in these shells as bases\r\nfor group divisions.\r\n\r\nOne might expect greater individual variation among the Flint Hills\r\nspecimens, owing to the physical changes that were taking place during\r\nthe close of the Carboniferous and the early Permian; changes which soon\r\ncaused this species, together with many others, to become extinct.\r\nHowever, this cannot be said of the most striking case (No. 11) from the\r\nTopeka limestone. It would seem that such variations as are found in\r\nNos. 3 and 11 would be decidedly detrimental to the well-being of the\r\nanimal, though the latter of the two seems to have been a vigorous\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n INDIANA UNIVERSITY, BLOOMINGTON,\r\n         APRIL 8, 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Explanation of Plate VI.\r\n\r\n Drawings by Sydney Prentice, except No. 12, which is by C.
