The present is distinguished from the last\r\nedition by the extension of such parts as were previously meagre; a\r\ntable of the constituents of food has been added, which it is hoped\r\nmay prove useful; a longer account of several varieties has been\r\ngiven, and the chapter on diseases has been considerably enlarged,\r\nand several new remedies indicated.\r\n\r\n_Willesden, Midsummer, 1854._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\nThe object of this little work is purely practical; its aim is to\r\nplace in the hands of persons who may not have had much experience,\r\na book which should contain all that is most essential to be known\r\nrespecting the housing, feeding, breeding, and treatment of fowls;\r\nand to this has been added such information as the experience of\r\nthe author has enabled him to give respecting the most profitable\r\nvarieties viewed as agricultural stock.\r\n\r\n_August, 1853._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PROFITABLE POULTRY,\r\n\r\n                               &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE FOWL HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe singular fact that our common domestic fowls are destitute of any\r\nparticular English name, points at once to their foreign origin; and,\r\nalthough in the course of many generations, they have become greatly\r\ninured to the rigors of our climate, they still retain so far their\r\noriginal constitution as to require the protection of habitation\r\nduring, at least, a great part of the year.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important requisites in a fowl house is absolute\r\ndryness, nothing being more fatal to poultry than damp; on clayey\r\nsoil, or in moist situations, dryness must be secured, either by\r\ndrainage or by raising the floor several inches above the surface of\r\nthe ground; in cold situations especially, the aspect of the house\r\nis also of some importance; if practicable, the windows and other\r\nopenings should face the south, as this secures a greater degree of\r\nwarmth during the winter, an advantage which is also obtained by\r\nhaving the roof ceiled.\r\n\r\nThe perches on which the fowls roost should be low, especially\r\nfor the larger varieties, as otherwise the violence with which\r\nthey descend causes lameness, and not unfrequently fracture of\r\nthe breast bone; in order to prevent the breast bones becoming\r\ncrooked (a circumstance which greatly injures their appearance,\r\nand consequently their value as table birds), the perches should be\r\nmuch larger than ordinary; a split fir pole, three inches across\r\non the flat side, which should be turned downwards, will be found\r\nadvantageous, and a height of not more than three or four feet is\r\ndesirable, as it enables the fowls to be readily caught after they\r\nhave gone to roost, and prevents lameness; for Cochins it is even\r\nnecessary that the perches should be much lower; their height should\r\ncertainly not exceed one foot from the ground, otherwise, from the\r\nimperfect powers of flight possessed by these birds, the evils\r\nalluded to are very apt to occur. Heavy birds of this variety are\r\nsometimes subject to inflammatory tenderness of the feet; to prevent\r\nas much as possible the tendency to this disease, it is advantageous\r\nin these cases to lay some straight straw lengthway along the top of\r\nthe perches, binding it in its place with string.\r\n\r\nThe ground below the perches should be strewed with sand, gravel,\r\nor ashes, to a considerable depth, so that the dung may be removed\r\nwithout soiling the floor. This should be done every morning early,\r\nand the house thrown open during the day, so as to be thoroughly\r\npurified. It seldom happens that fowl houses are so built, as to\r\nrequire any distinct contrivance for ventilation; in cases, however,\r\nwhere the door and window are air-tight, means should be afforded\r\nfor a proper supply of fresh air; there should be an opening at or\r\nnear the bottom, and another at the top, these should be covered with\r\npieces of perforated zinc, to prevent any direct draught of cold air,\r\nwhich is very injurious. Cleanliness is also a consideration of the\r\nhighest importance in a fowl house; if ashes or sand are used, as\r\nrecommended, and the dung removed daily, this is readily secured; and\r\nin order to prevent as far as possible the annoyance of vermin, the\r\nhouse should be lime-washed once or twice a year, and the birds also\r\nbe provided with a box full of dry dust or ashes to _bathe_ in.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the health of fowls thus cleanly and warmly\r\nhoused, and that of those compelled to roost in a dark, damp, dirty\r\nhabitation is very great; these latter never becoming in good\r\ncondition. So injurious is damp and cold, that I have known instances\r\nin which all the inhabitants of a poultry house have been attacked\r\nwith violent catarrh terminating in roup, from an east window\r\nhaving been left open on a cold wet night; and it has been found\r\nby experiment, that scrofula may always be produced in chickens by\r\nconfining them in damp, cold, and dark habitations.\r\n\r\nI have found that exceedingly economical and efficient poultry-houses\r\nmay be built against any wall that is conveniently situated, the\r\nsides and front being boarded, and the roof formed of inch deal\r\nboards, laid closely edge to edge, up and down the slope, and\r\nprojecting over the sides and front so as to throw off the rain; the\r\ntop should be covered with thin cheap calico tightly strained, and,\r\nby brushing this over with a good coating of coal-tar, it is cemented\r\nto the roof, which is thus rendered water-tight.\r\n\r\nThe patent Asphalte felt forms a cheap and warm roofing, but it also\r\nrequires to be tarred over, in order to resist the weather. If the\r\npoultry-house is tiled, the downward current of cold air in winter,\r\nmay be prevented by lining the roof with straw supported by laths\r\nnailed to the rafters; and in other cases I have found that stout\r\nbrown paper, oiled or painted, and tacked smoothly to the under side\r\nof the rafters, has been very efficient in increasing the warmth of\r\nthe house, and consequently the production of eggs in winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FEEDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no subject on which a greater diversity of opinion\r\nexists among poultry keepers, than respecting the relative value of\r\nthe different substances used as food. This difference of opinion\r\narises from the general ignorance that prevails with regard to the\r\ntrue principles of feeding. It cannot be too strongly impressed\r\non all feeders of stock that the food eaten has to serve several\r\ndistinct purposes when taken into the body. One portion is consumed\r\nin supporting the natural warmth of the animal; another set of\r\nsubstances supplies the nourishment required for the growth of the\r\nbody, and replaces the daily wasting that occurs; a third yields the\r\nmaterials from which the bones are formed; and a fourth supplies the\r\nfat which is stored up in the bodies of animals; we may, therefore,\r\nspeak of the following classes of foods:--\r\n\r\n1st. _Warmth-giving Food._--As starch, which forms almost the entire\r\nbulk of rice, and the solid portion of potatoes; gum, sugar, &c.\r\n\r\n2nd. _Flesh-forming Food._--As gluten, &c., which exists in large\r\nproportion in wheat, oatmeal, peas, beans, middlings and sharps, and\r\nin somewhat smaller quantity in barley, Indian corn, &c.\r\n\r\n3rd. _Bone-making Food._--Which is found in larger proportion in the\r\nbran, or outer part of the grain, than in the inner parts.\r\n\r\n4th. _Fat-forming Food._--Consisting of fatty or oily substances;\r\nthese occur, to a considerable extent, in Indian corn (the yellow\r\nvariety), oatmeal, middlings, bran, &c.\r\n\r\nAll experiments that have been made tend to prove that each of\r\nthese kinds of food is unable to serve the purposes of the others;\r\nthus, to give an example, neither warmth-giving nor fat-forming\r\nsubstances are capable of adding to the flesh of a growing animal,\r\nnor can flesh-forming food increase the quantity of fat. In a mere\r\nelementary work, like the present, it is impossible to go into this\r\nsubject at any great length. Those who desire the facts on which\r\nthese statements are grounded are referred to the works of Johnston,\r\nLiebig, and other eminent agriculturists and agricultural chemists.\r\nWe must take the principles as granted, and apply them to an\r\nexamination of the different substances usually employed in poultry\r\nfeeding.\r\n\r\nGRAIN forms the staple food of poultry, the varieties used being\r\ngenerally either barley, oats, wheat, Indian corn, or rice.\r\n\r\n_Barley_ is perhaps more frequently used than any other grain;\r\nit is better relished by fowls than oats, and its first cost is\r\nconsiderably below that of wheat. It contains from ten to eleven\r\npounds of flesh-forming, sixty of starchy substances, and two to\r\nthree of oil or fat in every hundred.\r\n\r\n_Oats_ are not taken so freely as barley, which is apparently owing\r\nto the large proportion of husk they contain, which lessens their\r\nvalue as poultry food; but when used in the form of grits or oatmeal\r\nthey are eaten with great avidity, and in this state furnish one\r\nof the most wholesome and nutritious varieties of food, containing\r\neighteen of flesh-forming, sixty-three of starchy substances, and\r\nsix pounds of fatty materials in every hundred. No grain contains a\r\nlarger proportion of flesh-forming substances than oatmeal--it is,\r\ntherefore, the one best adapted to growing animals, and I have found\r\nthat chicken make much more rapid progress when it forms the chief\r\nportion of their food than when fed on any other substances. Cochin,\r\nand Spanish chicken especially, show its good effects by the rapidity\r\nwith which they feather when fed with it.\r\n\r\n_Wheat_, contrary to the popular opinion, is not more nutritious than\r\noatmeal; it contains about twelve pounds of flesh-forming nutriment,\r\nseventy of starchy, and two to four of oil, in every hundred. Its\r\ncost operates considerably against its employment, although it is\r\nextensively used by some breeders of choice poultry, with whom\r\nexpense of feeding is a secondary consideration.\r\n\r\n_Indian Corn_ is remarkable for the large proportion of oil contained\r\nin the yellow varieties, which averages eight pounds in every\r\nhundred; its capability of putting on flesh is not greater than that\r\nof barley, as it contains only eleven per cent. of flesh-giving food,\r\nand sixty-six of starchy matters. Cochins seem remarkably fond of it,\r\nbut I have found that it is refused by Dorkings and Spanish, when\r\nthey are able to obtain other grain.\r\n\r\n_Rice_ is the least nutritious of all grains, and therefore the worst\r\nthat can be given to growing animals. In the husked state in which\r\nit is usually found in this country, it contains scarcely any fat,\r\nor bone-making materials, and only seven per cent. of flesh-forming\r\nfood, (less than half the quantity contained in oatmeal,) being\r\nalmost entirely composed of starch. Boiled rice is a useful variation\r\nin the food of fowls, and is much relished, but as the main support\r\nof growing chicken it is very objectionable.\r\n\r\n_Buckwheat Flour_ is about equal in nutritive properties to that\r\nof wheat, but the large proportion of husk that the unground seeds\r\ncontain, must be taken into account in estimating its money value; it\r\nis commonly supposed to cause a greatly increased production of eggs,\r\nbut its chemical composition does not shew any superiority over many\r\nother varieties of food.\r\n\r\n_Dhoora_, or Indian millet, a small grain largely cultivated in\r\nthe east, is employed by some poultry keepers; it is much relished\r\nby fowls; the nutritious properties of the flour are very similar\r\nto those of wheat, and as it contains very little husk, it may be\r\nregarded as a valuable addition to the poultry dietary.\r\n\r\n_Malt Dust_, _Malt Culm_, _and Cummins_, are names given to the small\r\nsprouts of the barley which are broken off in the process of malting,\r\nand form a coarse fibrous powder. Malt dust contains from two to\r\nthree times as large a proportion of flesh-forming food as wheat,\r\nand in this respect far surpasses any of the substances ordinarily\r\nused as poultry food; its value not being generally known, it is\r\nfrequently used as manure; mixed with soft food, it is much relished\r\nby fowls, and as it may be obtained at a remarkably cheap rate, its\r\nemployment is very advantageous.\r\n\r\n_Bran_, _Pollard or Randan_, _and Middlings or Sharps_, particularly\r\nthe latter, I regard as most valuable additions to the food of\r\npoultry. In the first place they are economical--and they contain\r\na very high proportion (eighteen per cent.) of flesh-forming\r\nsubstances, and a very considerable quantity of oil (six per cent.)\r\nAnother circumstance which adapts them to the use of chicken is the\r\nlarge proportion of bone-making materials they contain.\r\n\r\nMany poultry feeders are in the habit of preparing the grain before\r\nuse; some simply soak the barley or other corn, by placing it in\r\nwater the previous evening, this lessens the time it has to remain\r\nin the crop, before passing on into the gizzard; others boil their\r\ncorn, a proceeding which has the advantage of rendering it more\r\ndigestible, as it effects an important change in the starchy part\r\nof the grain. Rice, especially, should always be boiled before\r\nuse, and it should be cooked in such a mode as to allow the grains\r\nto remain separate, which may be easily managed by boiling it in\r\na large quantity of water, to which a small piece of fat, as lard\r\nor dripping, has previously been added. The experience of all\r\nexperimental agriculturists is in favour of cooked food for live\r\nstock of all descriptions: from the change effected in the starch\r\nit is more nutritious, and is more rapidly digested; hence, there\r\nis less work for the stomach and digestive organs to perform, and\r\ntherefore they are less liable to become diseased. From considerable\r\nexperience in its employment, I can strongly recommend the following\r\ncooked food, as being exceedingly well adapted to supply all the\r\nsubstances requisite to support a healthy and vigorous existence. A\r\nquantity of middlings, with or without half its bulk of barley-meal,\r\nor a corresponding proportion of malt-dust, is placed in a coarse red\r\nware pan, and baked for about an hour in a side oven, or until the\r\nmixture is thoroughly heated throughout; water is then poured in, and\r\nthe whole stirred together until it becomes a crumbly mass; if too\r\nmuch water is added, the mixture becomes cloggy, a defect which is\r\neasily remedied by stirring in a little dry meal. The advantage of\r\nthis method is that the food is prepared with scarcely any trouble,\r\nand there is no fear of its being burnt as in boiling. Sometimes the\r\nbarley meal is omitted, and the baked middlings mixed with rice which\r\nhas been previously boiled. This mixture forms the stock food of my\r\nold fowls, a liberal supply of grain being given during the day. I\r\nhave found that since its adoption they cost less in food, and that\r\nthey are in equally good or even in better condition than when fed on\r\nan unlimited supply of grain alone. Should the convenience for baking\r\nnot exist, it will be found more desirable to scald the middlings and\r\nmeal with boiling water than to mix them with cold.\r\n\r\nIf grain of any kind is broken or crushed, it should only be done\r\nshortly before use, unless it is thoroughly kiln dried; for when this\r\nis not done, the grain, from the moisture it contains, soon becomes\r\nmusty, sour, and unwholesome. Inferior samples of grain contain\r\nso large a proportion of husk that they are not desirable, and if\r\nregarded with reference to their nutritious properties the best will\r\nbe found the cheapest.\r\n\r\n_Potatoes_, when plentiful and free from disease, may be\r\nadvantageously substituted for rice, which they closely resemble, in\r\ncontaining a large amount of starch; there is less waste in their\r\nuse, if steamed, than when boiled.\r\n\r\n_Peas_, _Beans_, _and Lentils_, either whole or ground, are much\r\nused by many feeders; they contain a larger amount of flesh-forming\r\nfood than grain--on the average about twenty-four per cent., whilst\r\nthe quantity of fat is very small, not usually more than two in every\r\nhundred; but they are not easily digested, and are too stimulating to\r\nbe regarded as a wholesome diet. I have traced many cases of disease,\r\nsuch as white comb in Cochins, inflammation of the stomach and egg\r\npassage, &c., &c., to their employment.\r\n\r\n_Hemp Seed_ is frequently given to cause the increased production\r\nof eggs, an effect which it can only produce at the sacrifice of\r\nthe health of the fowls. Hemp is used in India as a most powerful\r\nmedicine; the evil effects of the seeds on caged birds are known to\r\nall bird keepers. I regard it as one of the most injurious substances\r\ngiven to fowls.\r\n\r\n_Fresh Green Vegetables_ form an indispensable addition to the\r\nfood of poultry. Those having a free range in the country supply\r\nthemselves with this kind of food; when they are kept in other\r\nsituations they should be supplied daily with turf, cabbage, lettuce,\r\nor turnip leaves, and in the absence of these substances, as on\r\nshipboard, a little moistened corn, allowed to sprout, will be found\r\nvery advantageous.\r\n\r\n_Cooked Vegetables_, such as parsnips, carrots, turnips, &c., are\r\nmuch relished, particularly the former; they form an useful and\r\nwholesome variation in the diet.\r\n\r\n_Animal Food._--The most advantageous animal food for fowls, and on\r\nwhich they make the most rapid and healthy progress, consists in the\r\nworms, snails and insects that they obtain naturally when unconfined;\r\nI do not think that there is any other kind of food which conduces\r\nso much to their healthy condition; where it cannot be obtained, a\r\nsmall quantity of fresh meat (either raw or cooked) may be chopped\r\nsmall and given to them; it is, however, but a poor substitute for\r\nthe natural insect food. The maggots of the flesh fly, obtained by\r\nhanging up some meat to putrefy, are often employed, but I doubt very\r\nmuch, whether, in wholesomeness, they are at all equal to worms, and\r\nthe plan is objectionable from the offensive odour of the putrefying\r\nmeat; if it is thought desirable to employ maggots the best mode is\r\nto allow the animal substance to remain exposed to the air until\r\nthoroughly fly-blown, if it is then buried eighteen inches deep,\r\nthe maggots remain under ground until they attain their full size,\r\nwhen they work their way towards the surface, before changing into\r\nthe perfect insects; the fowls soon discover their approach, and by\r\nscratching obtain a plentiful supply; the maggots by working their\r\nway through the soil are cleansed from any adhering putridity, and\r\nthe search for the gradual supply affords amusement for the fowls;\r\neven employed in this way, however, I do not think flesh maggots so\r\ndesirable as worms.\r\n\r\n_Tallow Chandler’s Greaves_, which are left on melting the fat from\r\nthe stale scraps of the butchers, and the putrid accumulation of\r\nthe marine store shop, are strongly recommended by some persons as\r\ncausing an increased quantity of eggs. Animal substances which have\r\nonce been in a state of putrefaction cannot by any subsequent process\r\nbe formed into healthy food, and I can state from experience that\r\ngreaves are exceedingly injurious to laying hens. Even dogs, when fed\r\nupon greaves, become offensive, mangy, and out of condition; their\r\neffect upon fowls cannot be less injurious.\r\n\r\nIt will not, I trust, be thought that the subject of food has been\r\ntreated at an undue length, for I am confident that by far the\r\ngreater number of diseases that occur in fowls arise from improper\r\nfeeding. I have, therefore, arranged the following Table, in order\r\nto render the comparison of the relative value of the different\r\nsubstances more easily made.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                TABLE\r\n\r\n    Showing the number of pounds of different substances contained\r\n                 in every 100lbs. of grain, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n  [When a (--) is used it signifies that the quantity has not been exactly\r\n                              ascertained.]\r\n\r\n  Column Key\r\n  B - Water.\r\n  C - Flesh-forming Food (Gluten, &c.)\r\n  D - Fat or Oil.\r\n  E - Warmth-giving Food (Starch, &c.)\r\n  F - Husk and Fibre.\r\n  G - Bonemaking Substances. &c., &c.\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------+------+-----+-------+------+-----+-------+\r\n  |    Every 100 lbs. of    |  B   |  C  |   D   |   E  |  F  |   G   |\r\n  +-------------------------+------+-----+-------+------+-----+-------+\r\n  |                         | lb.  | lb. |  lb.  |  lb. | lb. |  lb.  |\r\n  |Wheat            contains| 12   | 12  |   3   |  70  |   1 |   2   |\r\n  |Bran, Middlings, &c. ”   | 14   | 18  |   6   |  53  | --  |   5   |\r\n  |Oats, with husk      ”   |  9½  | 15  |   6   |  47  |  20 |   2   |\r\n  |Oatmeal              ”   |  9   | 18  |   6   |  63  |   2 |   2   |\r\n  |Barley               ”   | 11   | 11  |   2   |  60  |  14 |   2   |\r\n  |Malt Dust            ”   |  6   | 30  |   --  |  --  |  -- |   8   |\r\n  |Indian Corn          ”   | 10   | 11  |   8   |  66  |   5 |   1   |\r\n  |Rice, husked         ”   | --   |  7  |   --  |  80  |  -- |a trace|\r\n  |Dhoors               ”   | 12   | 11  |   --  |  70  |   4 |   2   |\r\n  |Buckwheat            ”   | --   | 11  |   --  |  --  |  -- |  --   |\r\n  |Peas, &c.          }     |      |     |       |      |     |       |\r\n  |Beans              } ”   | 15   | 25  |   2   |  48  |   8 |   2   |\r\n  |Tares              }     |      |     |       |      |     |       |\r\n  |Lentils            }     |      |     |       |      |     |       |\r\n  |Potato               ”   | 75   |  2  |a trace|  19  |   3 |    ¾  |\r\n  +-------------------------+------+-----+-------+------+-----+-------+\r\n\r\n\r\nMy position in connection with the _Cottage Gardener_, has given\r\nme the opportunity of examining more dead and diseased fowls than\r\nperhaps ever fell to the lot of one individual; and, as the most\r\ncertain result of my experience, I can state that more than one half\r\nthe cases that come under my care, or that are examined by me after\r\ndeath, are caused by errors in feeding.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the digestive stomach (which is situated between the\r\ncrop and the gizzard), caused by the use of peas, beans, hemp seed,\r\nor by the endeavour to force fowls forward for exhibition, or to make\r\nthem up for the sale room, is a most frequent result. Apoplexy from\r\nover-feeding, especially in laying hens, and paralysis from the same\r\ncause, are frequent. Inflammation of the egg passage is a common,\r\nand unless timely treated, another fatal complaint, generally taking\r\nits rise in over-stimulating food; and leg weakness, from the weight\r\nincreasing faster than the strength, is common in Cochins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Water._--A daily supply of fresh clean water is indispensable to\r\nthe health of fowls. Many diseases are caused by their drinking from\r\nstagnant ditches and the impure and filthy drainings of manure heaps,\r\n&c. A cheap fountain, the best that I have ever seen, inasmuch as\r\nit is capable of being cleansed internally, may be made out of any\r\nwide-mouth earthenware jar and common glazed flower-pot saucer; by\r\nboring a small hole in the jar, an inch or an inch and a half from\r\nthe edge, then filling it with water, putting the saucer on the top,\r\nbottom upwards, and quickly turning them both together upside down,\r\nwhen the water will be found to flow into the saucer to the height of\r\nthe hole in the jar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BREEDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch variety of opinion prevails respecting the best mode of\r\nconstructing the nests for laying and sitting hens. In this, as in\r\nall other cases, the nearer we can imitate nature the better; I\r\nobject to the rows of pigeon-holes so frequently employed, as the\r\nclose crowding of the fowls harbours vermin, and renders it difficult\r\nto thoroughly clean the nests after the eggs are hatched, and believe\r\nit will be found more conducive to health and comfort if the nests\r\nare quite distinct from each other, and are so formed that they can\r\nbe entirely removed after the chicken are hatched. The plan that I\r\nhave found to answer best is to use shallow baskets or boxes, which\r\ncan be partially filled with sifted coal ashes, road drift, sand, or\r\nany similar material; on this a little short straw is placed, and the\r\nhen hollows out a slight concavity, which prevents the eggs rolling\r\nfrom under her, and in this way a very good imitation of a natural\r\nnest is obtained. The ashes do not harbour vermin, and I have found\r\nthat eggs hatch much better than in those nests made solely of straw.\r\nCare should be taken so nearly to fill the basket or box that the hen\r\ncan leave without having to spring up from the eggs, and can return\r\nwithout jumping down upon them, otherwise there is great risk of\r\ntheir being broken. Should the hen be particularly fearful, a board\r\nplaced in a slanting position over the basket with the upper end\r\nleaning against the wall, will afford all the privacy required.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that hens should be allowed to sit where they have\r\nbeen previously laying, as there is usually much trouble, except in\r\nthe case of Cochins, in inducing a hen to sit steadily in a new nest.\r\nHens evince a strong desire to lay where there are other eggs, hence\r\nnest eggs are usually employed; they are frequently made of chalk,\r\nbut from the hardness of the material they are apt to break the new\r\nlaid egg; soft white wood, turned into the required shape, makes\r\nthe best that I have seen, as it does not break the eggs or lose its\r\nshape, and is capable of being easily washed, if soiled. Natural eggs\r\nare not desirable for nest eggs, as they are very apt to break when\r\nthey become stale, and so render the nest exceedingly foul.\r\n\r\nWhen a hen becomes broody, which is shewn by her remaining on the\r\nnest a longer time than usual, and by the peculiar _clucking_ noise\r\nshe makes, it is desirable to give her three or four nest eggs to sit\r\non, to test her steadiness for a day or two, and if she is found to\r\nsit well the eggs for hatching may be placed in the nest, either when\r\nshe leaves it to feed, or by lifting her off in the evening; if a\r\nbroody hen is removed from the nest during the day she usually flies\r\nback, at the great risk of breaking the eggs, whereas, if lifted off\r\nafter dark, she generally remains quietly on the ground and allows\r\nthe requisite number of eggs to be put into the nest, when she may be\r\nlifted back again.\r\n\r\nThe fresher the eggs that are used for hatching the better. If\r\npracticable, it is desirable that they should not have been laid\r\nmore than a fortnight; although they will hatch after a much longer\r\ntime, if carefully protected from the drying influence of the air and\r\nlight, and from too high or too low a temperature, in bran or some\r\nsimilar material.\r\n\r\nEggs intended for hatching, should be kept with the large end\r\nupwards, otherwise they should be moved occasionally to prevent the\r\nyolk adhering to the upper side; the lid of the box containing them\r\nshould be closed, in order to protect them from the light, and from\r\nthe rapid changes of temperature, and the whole should, especially in\r\nsummer, be kept in a cool place. When sittings of eggs are forwarded\r\nby railway or other public conveyance, it is customary to pack them\r\ntightly in bran, with considerable spaces between them, others\r\nrecommend oats to be used; my own experience is most decidedly in\r\nfavour of hay, or soft straw, which, by its elasticity prevents all\r\nshaking, and enables the eggs to be forwarded any distance without\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nThis season, I forwarded two sittings of eggs to the far north of\r\nEngland, one packed most carefully in bran, the other in hay; of the\r\nfirst not one egg hatched, whilst every one of the second produced a\r\nchick; and a sitting that I received this season, which was similarly\r\npacked, every egg was fertile, although the basket had travelled from\r\nthe north by coach, rail, and carrier.\r\n\r\nThe number of eggs placed under a hen usually varies from ten to\r\nfifteen; no fixed rule can be given--so much depends on the season of\r\nthe year, the size of the eggs, and that of the hen. If the eggs are\r\ncooled during the sitting, which necessarily happens if they are so\r\nnumerous that the outer ones are covered merely by the feathers, and\r\nnot by the body of the hen, the chicken will be weakly or deformed;\r\nand as the hen constantly shifts their position by pulling those\r\noutside into the centre, and so forcing out the others, all become\r\nchilled in their turn, and a weakly brood is the result. A hen when\r\nsitting, separates the feathers to so great an extent, that the eggs,\r\nif they are not in too great number, are in contact with the naked\r\nskin of the breast, and such a quantity should only be given, as can\r\nbe covered in that manner.\r\n\r\nI am quite confident that a larger number of chicken can be ensured\r\nby sitting a moderate than a large number of eggs, and as to their\r\nhealth and vigour there is no comparison.\r\n\r\nIn those varieties which lay large eggs, such as Dorkings, I never\r\ngive a hen more than thirteen eggs, and usually a smaller number; in\r\nwinter, I would not exceed eight or nine. In the case of Cochins,\r\nwhere the eggs are small and the hens large, a greater number may be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the age of the parents, I believe that it is not so\r\ndesirable to breed from hens in their first as in the second or third\r\nyears; the chicken of first year fowls, are more leggy, smaller, and\r\nless hardy and vigorous than those that are produced by more mature\r\nparents. When young birds are employed, it is desirable to mate\r\npullets with cocks two or three years old, and cockerels with old\r\nhens.\r\n\r\nSome persons even carry their objection so far, as not to allow young\r\nbirds to hatch the eggs of older birds, being under the impression\r\nthey do not sit with sufficient steadiness. This is certainly not\r\ntrue as regards Dorkings and Cochins, for I have found pullets of\r\neight months age, exemplary sitters and nurses; and at the time of\r\nwriting this in July, I have two Dorkings of fourteen months age,\r\nwhich are running about with their third broods, having hatched in\r\nJanuary, May, and July.\r\n\r\nTo ensure healthy and large-sized chicken it is absolutely necessary\r\nthat there should not be any relationship between the parents;\r\nbreeding “in and in,” as it is termed, is well known by all rearers\r\nof stock to produce diseased and weakly offspring, hence it is\r\nindispensable that there should be an introduction of fresh male\r\nbirds every two or three years. In farm-yards where there are large\r\nnumbers of poultry, it will be found by far the most desirable plan\r\nto keep separately a cock with from four to six of the best hens,\r\nand to hatch their eggs alone. By this means the chicken are all\r\ncertain of coming from the best birds, and a much smaller number of\r\ncocks may be kept with the main stock of hens than would otherwise\r\nbe desirable. The practice of allowing the hens to run with several\r\ncocks is calculated to deteriorate the breed materially, should\r\ntherefore a larger number of eggs be required for hatching, than\r\nfurnished by a cock and four or six hens, another set should be\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, over crowding must be carefully guarded against,\r\nespecially where poultry are kept in a confined situation, for if\r\nthe ground becomes tainted, the inevitable result is that disease\r\nbreaks out, and that the chicken, being less able to withstand its\r\ninfluence than older birds, die off rapidly, in spite of good food,\r\nwarm housing, and every attention that can possibly be paid to them.\r\n\r\nMany persons are in the habit of lifting off the sitting hens in\r\norder to feed them, I believe that all such interference is uncalled\r\nfor and injurious; the less a hen is disturbed whilst hatching the\r\nbetter--when hungry and thirsty she will leave the nest, and should\r\nbe then fed most liberally. Whole corn I think the best for hatching\r\nhens, as it remains longer in the crop and so satisfies hunger for a\r\ngreater length of time. In addition to food and water the hens should\r\nalways be provided with a heap of dry ashes, to roll in, to enable\r\nthem to free themselves from vermin.\r\n\r\nOn the twentieth day some of the chicken usually begin to chip\r\nthe shell, and, generally speaking, they are all hatched on the\r\ntwenty-first, that is on the same day three weeks that the eggs are\r\nplaced under the hen. The practice of removing the first hatched and\r\nplacing them in flannel by the fire side, is followed by many, but\r\nI do not see any possible advantage that can arise from so doing;\r\nit is impossible to give the exact temperature of the mother, and a\r\ndegree of heat higher or lower must necessarily be disadvantageous;\r\nthe only interference that I think desirable, is to remove, if it can\r\nbe readily accomplished, the empty shells, otherwise the unhatched\r\neggs are apt to slip into them, and the chicken, although furnished\r\nwith power to break through one shell are unable to force their way\r\nthrough two. The addled eggs (which are readily distinguished by\r\ngiving them the slightest possible shake, when the moving of the\r\nliquid contents is felt) may also be removed so as to give more room\r\nto the live birds.\r\n\r\nI am aware that these recommendations to leave natural operations to\r\nnature are contrary to what are frequently found in books, but I am\r\nmerely writing the results of my own experience, and I have always\r\nfound the more the hatching hens are meddled with, the worse the\r\nresult. It is a notorious fact that when a hen steals a nest in some\r\ncopse or place where she can remain unmolested, she almost invariably\r\nbrings forth a more numerous and stronger brood than when she sits in\r\nthe hen-house.\r\n\r\nThe chicken require neither food nor drink on the day on which they\r\nare hatched; in fact, _both are injurious_, as they interfere with\r\nthe natural digestion of the yolk, which is absorbed into the bowels\r\nat the period of hatching, and constitutes the first food. If grits,\r\noatmeal, &c., are spread before the hen on the twenty-first day, she\r\nis induced to leave the nest, and the last hatched chicken, which\r\nare not perhaps yet dried, are unable to follow, and being weakly,\r\nperish; or unhatched eggs may be left.\r\n\r\nIf undisturbed, the hen seldom leaves the nest on the twenty-first\r\nday, and on the twenty-second the chicken will be found strong enough\r\nto follow her, and any unhatched eggs may be destroyed, for those\r\nchicken that are not then able to follow her will seldom be found to\r\nrepay the trouble that may be taken with them. The plan of cramming\r\npeppercorns and other spices down the throats of chicken is cruel\r\nin the extreme, and moreover, exceedingly injurious. I have found\r\nthe best food to be two-thirds sweet coarse oatmeal and one-third\r\nbarley meal, mixed into a crumbly paste with water; this is very much\r\nrelished, and the chicken make surprising progress upon it, they are\r\nalso very fond of a little cold oatmeal porridge, and, by way of\r\nvariety, I sometimes give them a few scalded grits dusted over with a\r\nlittle barley meal to cause them to separate.\r\n\r\nMilk is frequently used to mix the barley or oatmeal, but from the\r\nextent to which it is then exposed to the air it soon becomes sour\r\nin summer, and is decidedly injurious if employed in that state; no\r\nmore food, therefore, should be mixed with milk than can be eaten in\r\na couple of hours. Sopped bread is by no means desirable, the chicken\r\nbecome weakly and affected with diarrhœa from its use, in fact it\r\nhas not that degree of solidity which is requisite to afford an\r\nopportunity for the exercise of the natural grinding action of the\r\ngizzard. A little chopped onion, or, still better, some finely shred\r\ngreen onion tops mixed with the food is highly advantageous, and, in\r\nthe opinion of many persons, lessens very much the susceptibility to\r\nroup.\r\n\r\nWith regard to animal food there is none equal to the natural supply\r\nof worms and insects obtained by the hen; small worms, or a barrow\r\nfull of mould, containing an ant’s nest, may be given if the chicken\r\nare in a confined situation, and will be found far superior to boiled\r\negg, chopped meat, or any more artificial substitute. Curds are\r\nfrequently used, and, I believe, furnish the best substitute for the\r\nnatural insect food, but I have had no experience in their use, as\r\nI have never kept, nor even think it desirable to keep fowls, or at\r\nall events to rear chicken, in situations where their natural food\r\nis unattainable. It is requisite that chicken should either have a\r\nconstant supply of food or be fed at very short intervals--even every\r\nhour is not too often, if practicable.\r\n\r\nCooping, which is so frequently employed to restrain the wandering\r\nof hens with chicken, I regard as exceedingly objectionable. In many\r\ncases I admit it to be a necessary evil, but not the less an evil;\r\na hen when cooped has no power of scratching for insects and worms\r\n(the best of all possible food), the chicken are therefore confined\r\nstrictly to the artificial diet with which they are supplied.\r\nWhatever also may be the difference in the temperature of the day or\r\nchange of weather, she cannot alter her position, or seek shelter\r\nfrom cold, wind, or wet; the ground under the coop becomes foul\r\nunless the latter is moved frequently, and the hen does not so soon\r\nrecover the effects of her confinement in sitting as when she is\r\nallowed her liberty and obtains green food to peck at.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently said that when hens are not cooped they roam so far\r\nthat the chicken become fagged, and that oftentimes they are left\r\nbehind by the hen. I believe that if the hen and chicken are well\r\nfed, and at short intervals, this will not occur; but should giving\r\nthem their entire liberty be objectionable, the plan of enclosing a\r\nsmall run with laths, wire-work, or netting, may be had recourse to.\r\nThese contrivances may be either moveable or fixed; in the latter\r\ncase the ground in the run may be turned up with the spade or fork\r\noccasionally, so as to give the hens fresh soil to scratch in. Many\r\npersons say they cannot confine their fowls in this manner, as they\r\nfly over; a little attention to the habits of the birds would enable\r\nthem to prevent this inconvenience. Fowls never fly _over_ any\r\nboundary, but always _on to_ it, preparatory to descending on the\r\nother side, and if the top is constructed in such a manner that they\r\ncannot rest upon it, they evince a great disinclination to attempt\r\nthe passage. The plan I adopt is to have five or six feet laths of a\r\ngreater or less degree of stoutness as required, nailed three inches\r\napart to two horizontal rails, the lower near the ground, the upper\r\nbeing eight inches below the tops of the laths, which are pointed.\r\n\r\nI have found that this fence is sufficient to confine Dorking,\r\nSpanish, and even Hamburghs, but then the fowls have always an\r\nunlimited supply of every variety of food; and when I receive a bird\r\nI usually lighten one wing by running the scissors down each side\r\nof the ten primary quill feathers, which is a much better plan than\r\ncutting the shafts across, as in the latter case the bird is much\r\ndisfigured.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with my suggestion, Messrs. Greening, of Church Gates,\r\nManchester, have manufactured some of their patent fencing on the\r\nsame plan, namely, spiked at the top and chicken proof below,\r\nas shewn in the cut; from experience I can recommend it as most\r\nefficient, and from its great strength and durability it is much more\r\neconomical than the ordinary hexagonal pattern in common use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDuring summer it is not requisite to remove the hen and chicken\r\nfrom these runs at night, but a little house made of a few boards\r\nnailed together, so as to resemble a dog-kennel, made water-tight, is\r\nnecessary for shelter.\r\n\r\nSome of the most successful breeders of Cochins have their grounds\r\nthus partitioned out and furnished with rude huts, boarded at the\r\nsides and covered on the top with some of the patent asphalte felt\r\nnow so much used for roofing. This, if properly tarred, is perfectly\r\nwaterproof, and being a bad conductor of heat, is warm in winter and\r\ncool in summer.\r\n\r\nThe common open circular wicker coop I regard as an exceedingly\r\nuseful article in a poultry-yard, but not for the purpose to which\r\nit is generally applied, of keeping the hens _in_, but, on the\r\ncontrary, for keeping them _out_. I have found it very convenient for\r\nfeeding chicken under; the oatmeal, grits, and other expensive food\r\nused for the young birds is apt to be devoured by those of advanced\r\ngrowth, an evil which is readily prevented by placing it under a\r\nlarge coop which admits the younger chicken, and enables them to feed\r\nundisturbed by the others.\r\n\r\nThe remark is often made, that chicken reared in the country by\r\ncottagers are more vigorous and healthy than those bred in the most\r\nexpensive poultry houses; this I believe to be entirely owing to the\r\nmore natural circumstances under which they are brought up. Fresh\r\nair, fresh grass, and fresh ground for the hens to scratch in, far\r\nmore than counterbalance the advantage of expensive diet and superior\r\nlodging, if these latter are unaccompanied with the more necessary\r\ncircumstances just described.\r\n\r\nThe plans here recommended I found to be more than ordinarily\r\nsuccessful during the most unfavourable chicken seasons, even on\r\nthe cold clay soil in the neighbourhood of London, and I have there\r\nseverely tested their perfect efficiency with regard to Cochins,\r\nDorkings, Spanish, and Hamburghs.\r\n\r\nIn cases where fowls are bred _in and in_ to preserve peculiar\r\nmarkings, or where, so to speak, a very artificial variety has been\r\nproduced, great delicacy necessarily results; this, for example, is\r\nthe case in the Sebright Bantam, and hardiness cannot be expected in\r\nsuch breeds; as well might the breeder of King Charles’ spaniels or\r\nItalian greyhounds expect similar success to that of the rearer of\r\nthe Scotch terrier or sheep dog.\r\n\r\nWhen chicken are hatched in the winter, or early spring months,\r\neither for competition in the chicken classes at the summer\r\npoultry shows, or for table use, some slight modification of these\r\nproceedings is requisite. I have tried enclosed rooms, both heated by\r\nstoves and fire-places and without, but have never found them answer,\r\nand am confident that even in winter chicken do better in an open\r\nshed than in any other situation; the shed, however, must face the\r\nsouth, and be warmly and closely sheltered from the north and east.\r\nThe hens must be placed in coops, where all the sun can reach them;\r\nand there should be a little run of a few feet, enclosed by laths,\r\nwire-work or netting, for the hen and chicken to exercise in. The\r\ncommon triangular wooden coop is a very useful one for early chicken;\r\nbut it should have a false bottom, to keep them off the cold ground,\r\nand this should be made to slide in and out, so as to be readily\r\nremoved and cleaned. The coops, at night, should be warmly covered up\r\nwith sacking or matting, and plenty of short hay or soft straw placed\r\nin the interior. The most successful breeder of early Cochins in the\r\nyear 1853, reared all his birds in a shed thus arranged; but, instead\r\nof coops, he employed snugly built brick boxes, with abundance of\r\nshort straw for the hen and chicken to sleep in; and in front of each\r\nbox was a little alley or run, enclosed by laths, for an exercise\r\nground,--the run not extending in front of the shed, so that it was\r\nnot subject to be damped by the rain or dew.\r\n\r\nAnother precaution necessary to be taken with early chicken, even\r\nafter they have attained some size, is to avoid letting them run in\r\nthe grass whilst it is wet with dew, otherwise they are very apt to\r\nget chilled, and die with cramp. When hens are cooped care must be\r\ntaken to supply them with gravel and a little mortar rubbish, or\r\nbroken oyster shells,--the first being required for the digestion of\r\nthe food, the second to furnish the materials of the bones of the\r\ngrowing chicken.\r\n\r\nAs I have elsewhere stated, the rearing of early chicken is always\r\nattended with risk and trouble, and extraordinary success must not\r\nbe expected; it should only therefore be attempted under favourable\r\ncircumstances; and unless chicken are bred for the summer poultry\r\nshows, or for early table use, for which purpose they fetch a high\r\nprice in the market, it is not a desirable proceeding; for the best\r\nand finest birds, that alone should be kept for stock, are those\r\nhatched in April and May, as they attain their full size without\r\nhaving their growth once checked by cold.\r\n\r\nChicken, on the contrary, which are hatched at a late period of\r\nthe year, have their growth checked by the colds of winter, and\r\nconsequently never make large birds; hence the practice of hatching\r\nBantams in autumn to prevent their attaining a large size, an object\r\nwhich is only accomplished by a sacrifice of constitutional strength\r\nand hardihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PROFITABLE VARIETIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a work of this extent it is impossible to do more than allude to\r\nseveral of the least important varieties of the domestic fowl, and\r\nthis is of less moment as the general directions given with regard to\r\nfeeding, breeding, &c., apply, with very slight variations, to all\r\nthe different breeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCHIN CHINA HEN.]\r\n\r\nCOCHINS OR SHANGHAES.--Cochins are perhaps the most popular fowl\r\nat the present time, and, in the opinion of many, deservedly take\r\nthe first place on account of their good qualities as profitable\r\nstock, no less than from the estimation in which they are held as\r\nfancy fowls. So extensively have they been diffused over the entire\r\nlength and breadth of the land, that a lengthened description of\r\ntheir peculiarities is scarcely requisite. Their large size,\r\npeculiar crow, small wings, rudimentary tail, and the extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of the fluffy feathers of the thighs and under parts of\r\nthe body are familiar to all; these remarkable characteristics are\r\ncarried to an extreme degree in the bird shown in the engraving,\r\nwhich is a representation of an imported hen, formerly the property\r\nof Mr. Andrews. In purchasing Cochins for stock, care should be\r\ntaken to obtain birds of good quality, as breeding from second and\r\nthird-rate fowls will be found exceedingly undesirable. As regards\r\nsize, the cocks should weigh at least 10lbs., the hens 8lbs., when\r\nfull grown; they should be short on the legs, which should be yellow\r\nand well feathered down to the tips of the outer toes, which should\r\nonly be four in number on each foot. The tail feathers should, in\r\nboth sexes, be very small, and almost hidden by the dense mass of\r\nsaddle feathers covering the back, and the fluff should be well\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nWith regard to colour, at present the fashion is entirely in favour\r\nof the light buff birds, which, to command the highest prices,\r\nmust even be destitute of dark markings on the neck hackle; or any\r\nslaty tinge in the downy under portions of the fluff, or of the\r\nbody feathers. The rage for light buff birds I regard as an undue\r\nprejudice, and believe the darker breeds will be found quite as\r\nvaluable for farming stock; in fact, the extreme prices which are\r\ncommanded by the lightest birds are simply owing to the difficulty of\r\nbreeding them perfectly free from dark colour; and am confident that\r\nit has had a very injurious effect upon the breed; for size and form\r\nhave been sacrificed in the endeavour to rear birds of the desired\r\ncolour, and in too many instances a set of small leggy almond shaped\r\nhens have taken the place of heavy square-built short-legged birds of\r\na darker colour.\r\n\r\nThe white birds, though exceedingly ornamental, are scarcely equal\r\nin character to the coloured varieties, and the black have hitherto\r\nbeen only produced by crossing a buff with a white, and, as might\r\nbe expected from such an origin, their progeny are very uncertain in\r\ntheir colour.\r\n\r\nPutting aside the value of Cochins as fancy fowls, their chief\r\nimportance as profitable poultry depends on the immense supply of\r\nwinter eggs yielded by the pullets of the year. This, I am confident,\r\nwill eventually be found their strongest recommendation; for table\r\nbirds, their length of leg, small breast, and game-like flavour, are\r\nobjectionable, and the colour of their skin renders them very unfit\r\nfor being used as boiled fowls. The attempt to breed pure Cochins\r\nwith a fuller breast I believe to be perfectly futile, their wings\r\nare so small in size that they never fly, and the muscles which\r\nmove the wings and form the entire mass of flesh on the breast, are\r\nconsequently of small size also; it would be as reasonable to expect\r\nthe muscles of a blacksmith in the arms of a draper, as the plumpness\r\nof a Dorking on the breast of a Cochin. The hens are extremely good\r\nsitters, their large size enabling them to cover a great number of\r\neggs, and their docility, and the readiness with which they sit in\r\nany situation in which they may be placed when broody, being also\r\ngreat recommendations. I have found that the eggs hatch remarkably\r\nwell, and that the chicken are equally, if not more hardy than those\r\nof other fowl.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of their good qualities, their contentedness in a\r\ncomparatively small space, their attachment to home, and the ease\r\nwith which they are confined by a three feet fence, must not be\r\nomitted. Their chocolate coloured eggs, though small, are of good\r\nflavour, but they have not yet been sufficiently introduced into the\r\nmarkets to state how they are appreciated by the public at large.\r\nWith regard to their laying twice in one day, such an event happens\r\nby far too rarely to be taken into consideration when speaking of\r\ntheir economical value, and when it does occur no egg is laid on the\r\nfollowing day. The great drawback to Cochins, as farmers’ fowls, is\r\nthe large quantity of food they require, which, notwithstanding all\r\nthat has been said to the contrary by their exclusive admirers, is\r\nconsiderably greater than that consumed by other varieties, and their\r\ndisposition leads them to remain at home instead of seeking for worms\r\nand other food in the fields; in fact, the old birds seem not to care\r\nfor the large earth worms, which are so greedily devoured by all\r\nother fowls.\r\n\r\nBRAHMA POOTRAS.--In the first edition of this book I inserted the\r\ndescription, from actual observation, of a pair of these birds that\r\nhad been sent to this country from the United States, by Dr. Bennett,\r\nwho claimed to be the original holder of the variety, and I left the\r\nquestion as to their being a distinct breed an open one; since that\r\narticle was published a more extended experience and the opportunity\r\nof making anatomical examinations of very many specimens, have led me\r\nto form a decided opinion respecting their origin and true character.\r\n\r\nAll the Brahmas that have come under my notice, and I have made a\r\npoint of seeing as many as possible, have been of either one or the\r\nother of the three following varieties, namely:--\r\n\r\n     1. Grey Cochins.\r\n     2. Cross-bred Cochin and Dorking.\r\n     3. Cross-bred Cochin and Malay, or Chittagong.\r\n\r\nThat the best of these birds are nothing more than grey Cochins,\r\nis proved by the fact that they have been frequently imported from\r\nShanghae with the buff birds, ever since the latter have been\r\nintroduced, and I know personally that the descendants of Grey\r\nCochins, which were thus introduced into this country before the name\r\nof Brahma was ever heard of, have taken prizes as Brahma Pootras; the\r\ncircumstance that those presented to the Royal Aviary were sent over\r\nfrom America as Grey Shanghaes would alone be sufficient to settle\r\nthe question. As to the name which has been given to these birds,\r\nthere is not one tittle of evidence to prove that they ever came\r\nfrom the region of the Brahma Pootra river, which, in the lower part\r\nof its course, is within one hundred and fifty miles of Calcutta,\r\nrunning through territory which has long been in the possession of\r\nthe British; further from its mouth it flows through the country of\r\nAssam, to which some years since the East India Company sent two\r\nmost observant naturalists to report on the natural history of the\r\nregion, and had any such remarkable fowls existed it is scarcely\r\ncredible that they could have escaped observation. A further and even\r\nmore conclusive proof, if one were needed, may be found in their\r\nanatomical peculiarities; it is a fact, universally recognized by\r\ncomparative anatomists, that the distinguishing characters of nearly\r\nallied animals are more strongly marked in the bones of the skull\r\nthan in any other part of the body; if the skull of a Cochin be\r\nexamined there will be found in the frontal bone, exactly under the\r\nbase of the comb, a deep narrow groove running from before backwards,\r\nthis remarkable structure is peculiar to these birds, being found in\r\nno other variety whatever, and is as strongly marked in the first\r\nnamed variety of so called Brahmas as in the Buff Cochins.\r\n\r\nWhen it was found that grey birds were realising large sums, every\r\nmode of raising them was put in practice; single grey Cochins were\r\nmated with buff, and the progeny, when of the desired colour, were\r\nsold as Brahmas; in other cases Buff Cochins were paired with light\r\nDorking hens, and many of the selected chicken found their way to\r\nthe sale room. Under my own eye last season many of these birds were\r\nso manufactured; during the autumn, after the breeding for stock\r\npurposes was over, a Buff Cochin cock was allowed to run with some\r\nDorking hens, the eggs of the lightest hen were hatched, and the\r\nChicken were all greys, some were clear-legged, some white-legged,\r\nothers five-toed; but several had well-feathered yellow legs with\r\nfour toes, and these were undistinguishable from a large number of\r\nthe birds sold as Brahmas. On examination I found the frontal groove\r\nstrongly marked, although, as might be expected, in a rather less\r\ndegree than in a pure bred Cochin.\r\n\r\nThe birds originating in the Malay or Chittagong cross have\r\nbeen chiefly imported from America, I cannot therefore give the\r\nparticulars of their manufacture, but the long snaky neck, the\r\nupright gait, and the peculiar carriage of the head, render other\r\nevidence unnecessary, These birds also have the characteristic\r\nfrontal groove.\r\n\r\nAfter what has been stated, it will scarcely be expected that any\r\nlengthened description of these birds should be given. The best are\r\nsimply Cochins, and as silver pencilled Shanghaes or Brahma Pootras,\r\nthey were originally avowedly exhibited at the London shows. The\r\nMongrels have every variety of form and almost of colour; from the\r\nmost celebrated yards are shewn clear legs and feathered legs; yellow\r\nlegs, and white legs; pea combs and single combs; white birds, grey\r\nbirds, and even black birds, all pure Brahmas!! One person writes\r\nthat they roam over acres, another authority states that they are\r\nmore domesticated than Cochins; on the one hand, you hear of their\r\nlaying eggs as large as those of turkeys, and on the other of their\r\nbeing of the average Cochin size; one day they are said to crow like\r\ntheir buff relations, and the next we hear that their voices are much\r\nmore mellifluous.\r\n\r\nMy opinion of their merits and demerits may be stated in a few words;\r\nof the half breeds I will only say that they are worthless for stock\r\npurposes, as they do not breed true to any particular character; of\r\nthe true grey Cochin I may state, as far as my experience goes, that\r\nthey are generally leggy compared with the best bred buffs, and that\r\nin many of them there is a remarkable tendency (especially in the\r\nhens) to accumulate internal abdominal fat, or in other words to “go\r\ndown behind” a state of things generally terminating in irregularity\r\nof the egg organs, which running on into inflammation is frequently\r\nfatal; at the same time, however, I have no doubt but that by careful\r\nbreeding for a season or two they may be produced in every respect\r\nequal to the buff birds; Dr. W. C. Gwynne, who has reared them longer\r\nthan any other amateur in this country, states his conviction that\r\nthe genuine strain are a very good variety of grey Cochin, without\r\nthe slightest cross: this verdict respecting them, coming as it\r\ndoes from one of the greatest admirers and most successful rearers\r\nof Brahmas, will, I have not the slightest doubt, be eventually\r\nuniversally acquiesced in; with regard to their hardihood as chicken,\r\nI may state that the most successful rearer of Cochins in the year\r\n1853, to whose plans I have already alluded, and who spared no\r\nexpense in getting first rate stock, informs me that he has reared\r\nBrahmas and Cochins in the same brood, and that he has not found the\r\nformer by any means the hardier variety.\r\n\r\nDORKINGS.--To those who rear chickens for the table there are no\r\nfowls so well adapted as the coloured Dorkings; though not remarkable\r\nas layers, as sitters and nurses they cannot be surpassed; whilst\r\ntheir large size, plump breasts, short legs, and delicate white\r\nflesh, render them the most desirable table birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPECKLED DORKINGS.]\r\n\r\nLatterly much attention has been paid to this variety, and the result\r\nhas been that great improvements in their size and good qualities\r\nhave been effected. The engraving represents one of the old birds,\r\nof whom it has been truly said, “Their qualities surpass their\r\ncharms.” In the improved kinds the head is smaller, the under part\r\nof the breast fuller, and the carriage of the bird more elegant, the\r\nbody being more compact; the feathers are also firmer, and I have\r\nfound along with this latter character that the birds are hardier\r\nand less subject to diseases of the egg organs. Dorkings vary very\r\nmuch in colour, and there is some difficulty in breeding them true\r\nto any marking. My own opinion is decidedly in favour of the dark\r\nbirds, both as to appearance and hardiness, and I think there are\r\nno more noble fowls than a heavy, broad-chested, dark Dorking cock\r\nand a compact short-legged hen. Dorkings are bred with both single\r\nand double, or rose combs, but the former are generally preferred,\r\non the score of appearance. In purchasing Dorkings for stock, broad\r\ncompact bodies and short white legs, with five toes on each foot,\r\nshould be regarded as indispensable; the weight of these birds varies\r\nvery considerably; in the pens which have taken prizes at the recent\r\npoultry shows the cocks have usually weighed about ten, and the hens\r\neight pounds, but these weights are beyond the average, and such\r\nbirds are not generally to be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe white Dorkings, although exceedingly ornamental, are not of equal\r\nvalue in an economical point of view, being much smaller in size,\r\nand narrower and longer in the body; they are almost invariably bred\r\nwith a rose or double comb, and are obviously a distinct variety from\r\nthe coloured Dorking, the latter having evidently derived its size,\r\naptitude to fatten, and other profitable characteristics from the\r\nlarge Surrey fowl, which differs only from what is now known as the\r\ncolored Dorking, in the absence of the fifth toe.\r\n\r\nThe great drawback to the value of this most useful breed is in\r\nthe delicacy of the chicken; in spite of every care they too often\r\nexhibit the evil effects of a constitutional delicacy when about\r\nthree weeks old, when their wings droop, and they die without any\r\nevident cause, whilst other birds hatched at the same time, and under\r\nthe same treatment, are running about full of health and vigour.\r\nThere is a very erroneous opinion, in many parts of the country,\r\nthat Dorkings can only be successfully reared in Kent or Surrey;\r\nthe absurdity of this statement is evident from the fact that the\r\nbest Dorkings, those that have carried off the first prizes at the\r\nvarious poultry shows, have not, with few exceptions, been natives\r\nof Surrey. The opinion has evidently arisen from their delicacy when\r\nchicken, and the fact that persons at a distance have often obtained\r\na stock of Dorkings, and then without any introduction of fresh\r\nblood, they have continued breeding “in and in” until the breed has\r\ndegenerated, not only in size, but in constitutional vigour; there is\r\nhowever no doubt but that on the dry chalky soil of Kent and Surrey\r\nthey are more likely to do well than in any situation where the\r\nground is wet or clayey.\r\n\r\nDorkings do not bear confinement well, requiring a good range;\r\nto attain a large size, and make good table birds, they must be\r\nliberally fed at every period of their lives, hence, and from the\r\nfact that they do not forage for themselves as well as the smaller\r\nvarieties, they are not the best fowls for the cottager, especially\r\nas their egg producing powers are not remarkable.\r\n\r\nI have found that pullets hatched in April and May usually, if well\r\nfed, begin to lay about Christmas, and there is no difficulty in\r\nhatching in the beginning of February, although there is always some\r\nuncertainty about rearing the chicken in cold weather; but I have\r\nfound that by cooping the hens in a shed open to the south they have\r\ndone much better than in an enclosed room.\r\n\r\nTo produce the fat fowls, that are seen in greater perfection in\r\nthe London markets than elsewhere, and which are generally termed\r\n(although they are not) capons, Dorkings are cooped for fatting\r\nat the age of three to four months in summer and five to six in\r\nwinter, being fed with oatmeal, mixed with water or milk; this must\r\nbe given fresh three times a day, the first meal being _early_ in\r\nthe morning; and, in addition, the birds should be supplied with\r\nwhole corn (either dry or boiled), gravel, clean water, and a turf\r\nor green meat; the most scrupulous cleanliness as to troughs, coops,\r\n&c., being observed. By these means a fowl, if previously well fed,\r\nwill be fat enough for any useful purpose in a fortnight to three\r\nweeks; should they be required very fat, some mutton suet; or, what\r\nis equally good, the parings of the loins of mutton, may be chopped\r\nup with the food. The unnatural process of cramming is frequently\r\nrecommended, but I have never found it necessary. It should be borne\r\nin mind that a fowl cannot be kept in the greatest degree of fatness\r\nfor any length of time, as the over repletion soon causes internal\r\ndisease. The houses must be dry, quiet, dark, and warm, and the\r\nfatting coops carefully kept from draught, and warmly covered at\r\nnight during cold weather.\r\n\r\nSPANISH.--The true Spanish fowls, known by their uniform black\r\ncolour, burnished with resplendant tints of green, the great\r\ndevelopment of comb and wattle, and the peculiar white face, which\r\nshould be free from any other colour, are magnificent birds. Regarded\r\nas profitable poultry, their strong recommendation consists in the\r\nnumber and very large size of the eggs laid by them. The hens seldom\r\nattempt to hatch, and are bad sitters and nurses; their eggs should\r\nconsequently be hatched by other varieties. The chicken are slow in\r\nfeathering, but I have not found them so delicate as is sometimes\r\nstated, it is not however desirable to hatch them very early in the\r\nseason, as they run about for a long time with naked necks and wings;\r\nand there is a remarkable difference in the fowls of the same brood,\r\nsome being far superior in size and qualities to the remainder. In\r\npurchasing Spanish, blue legs, the entire absence of white or colored\r\nfeathers in the plumage, and a large white face, with a very large\r\nhigh comb, which should be erect in the cock, though pendant in the\r\nhens, should be insisted upon. Although the flesh is of good quality,\r\nyet, from the want of size, the length and darkness of the legs,\r\nthe Spanish is not equal to the Dorking for the table, and from the\r\nlong period of their moulting, the laying in winter is considerably\r\ninterfered with; nevertheless, the large size and number of their\r\neggs renders them most profitable, and their handsome carriage and\r\nstriking contrast of colour in the comb, face, and plumage recommend\r\nthem to all; they are perhaps better adapted for a town fowl than\r\nany other variety, as when full grown they seem to suffer less\r\nfrom confinement to a small run; not unfrequently exceedingly good\r\nspecimens may be seen in the stable yards of London.\r\n\r\nThe price of very good white faced Spanish always ranges high,\r\nnotwithstanding that they have been largely bred in this country for\r\nmany years; this arises from the extreme uncertainty in the character\r\nof the chicken, for even when produced from eggs laid by first rate\r\nstock red faced birds constantly make their appearance, and these,\r\nthough equally useful as layers, are of no value as stock birds; it\r\nmay be remarked, that those cockerels and pullets are most promising\r\nthat exhibit a long bluish skinny face, as this generally changes\r\ninto pure white.\r\n\r\nIn the West of England, a variety of the Spanish known as Minorcas\r\nare much esteemed as profitable layers. They differ from their more\r\naristocratic relatives in possessing a white ear lobe merely, the\r\nface being red, and in a somewhat more compact and less leggy form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACK BREASTED RED GAME.]\r\n\r\nGAME FOWL.--This variety, formerly so extensively reared for the\r\ncock-pit, is still bred by many on account of its beauty and\r\nutility. The game cock is distinguished by a long head with a strong\r\nmassive beak, and a single upright comb; the chest is prominent and\r\nfleshy, the whole body muscular, the carriage bold and erect, and\r\nthe feathers particularly close and firm; the hens are remarkable\r\nfor their neat appearance, and are characterized by a large erect\r\nfan-shaped tail. In colour this breed varies greatly, amongst the\r\nmost esteemed strains are those known as the black breasted reds, the\r\nbrown breasted reds or gingers, the various piles, a term applied to\r\nsuch as have a proportion of white in the plumage, duckwings, blues\r\nor grays, and white and black. Game fowl fly well, and a good grass\r\nrun is absolutely essential to their well being; the hens usually lay\r\nabout five and twenty buff colored eggs before wanting to sit, and\r\nare unsurpassed as mothers and nurses; both sexes are good foragers,\r\nsupplying themselves with a great portion of their food. As table\r\nfowls they are small, though plump, the quality of the flesh being\r\nvery superior. The pugnacious disposition of the cockerels is much\r\nagainst them in a profitable point of view, and it is desirable to\r\ncut off their combs and wattles at the age of five or six months,\r\notherwise, from fighting, much suffering and loss of blood ensues,\r\nthis operation is usually performed with a pair of sharp scissors,\r\nand the application of a little green vitriol dissolved in water will\r\nbe found immediately to check the effusion of blood.\r\n\r\nHAMBURGH FOWLS.--There are two very distinct varieties of these\r\nbirds, the spangled and the pencilled; where fowls are kept mainly\r\nfor the production of eggs, no breeds are so advantageous; and as\r\nthey are comparatively unknown in many parts of the country, I\r\nhave entered rather fully into their description. I am indebted to\r\nan amateur, an extensive breeder of the spangled variety, for the\r\nfollowing account of their merits.\r\n\r\n“_Gold and Silver Spangled Hamburghs._--These very beautiful\r\nvarieties have not hitherto attracted the attention which their\r\nintrinsic merits so justly deserve. Indeed, except in the northern\r\ncounties, they have been until lately almost unknown.\r\n\r\n“I will endeavour, as briefly as possible, to put before my readers,\r\nfirstly, the origin, habits, and economical merits, and, lastly, the\r\ndesired points of beauty of these dandies (_par excellence_) of the\r\npoultry yard.\r\n\r\n“Firstly as to their history and origin--Unlike the pencilled\r\nHamburghs, which are imported wholesale from Holland, the spangled\r\nbirds are never so obtained, and although similar in some of their\r\nhabits, they are infinitely more hardy than their pencilled rivals,\r\nsuffer less from cold, lay better in winter, and are far less subject\r\nto roup; they also attain to a considerably greater weight and size.\r\nI am myself rather inclined to consider them, as they have for years\r\nundoubtedly been, natives of our northern counties, more especially\r\nYorkshire and Lancashire, although they are said to be common in\r\nRussia and the northern countries of Europe. The Spangled Hamburghs,\r\nor Pheasant Fowls, as the north country breeders call them, are, in\r\nmy judgment, the best and most regular layers I can recommend; but\r\nin this respect the gold and silver varieties somewhat differ. I\r\nhave generally found that the pullets of the former variety commence\r\nlaying at about six months old, and, if the season is moderately\r\nwarm, they continue to lay about nine eggs a fortnight, until their\r\nmoulting time the following year--I should say that on an average\r\nthey lay about 200 eggs per annum. They are everlasting layers, in\r\nthe strictest sense of the word, never sitting, and recommencing\r\ntheir labours of production about two months from the commencement\r\nof their moult. Their eggs are of a fair size, of a very light pinky\r\nbrown colour, and excellent flavour. Indeed, in the latter quality\r\nthe eggs of the Hamburgh fowls generally are not to be surpassed.\r\n\r\n“It is the birds of silver variety, however, which I regard and\r\nrecommend as perfect miracles of egg-producing constancy. They\r\ncommence laying, if in good health and with a _good run_ (an\r\nessential to the well-doing of both the varieties), at _five_ months\r\nold, and generally lay at least six days out of the seven, until the\r\nmoulting season arrives--in all probably some 250 eggs. They very\r\nquickly get their new plumage--and in six weeks recommence their\r\nlabours with the same praiseworthy diligence, until another season\r\npassed warns them that moulting time is again at hand. After the\r\nsecond year I do not consider it advisable to keep them for laying\r\npurposes, although I think the best chicken are bred from them after\r\nthat period with a young yearling cock.\r\n\r\n“Like their golden relations they never sit, and rarely evince the\r\nslightest desire to undertake the task of incubation. I feel quite\r\nconfident that no fowl produces so much _egg stuff_ with so _small\r\nan amount of food_. Give them a good run, a clean, dry, warm house\r\nat night, and one quarter of the food you bestow upon Cochins, and\r\nyou will have no further trouble with them. They feather early and\r\nquickly, and may safely be hatched early in April.\r\n\r\n“I must not, however, omit to state one drawback which there is to\r\nthe keeping my spangled pets--they fly like pheasants, and know not\r\nbounds. They are great enemies to flowers, fruit, vegetables, indeed,\r\nanything they can lay hold of; and although capable of being made as\r\ntame as any other fowls, in their instincts they seem almost more\r\nlike game than domesticated poultry. However, as a balance to this,\r\nthere is no fowl so capable of taking care of itself, of finding its\r\nown food, of avoiding danger, and of repaying its owner handsomely\r\nfor the slight care it demands at his or her hands. Indeed, I cannot\r\nrecommend to a beginner in poultry-keeping a more beautiful and\r\ninteresting, or a more profitable selection.\r\n\r\n“There is much difference of opinion about the desired points of\r\nbeauty in these birds. For the exact requirements in the north\r\ncountry shows I must refer my readers to the Rules of the Yorkshire\r\nSocieties, and I will therefore confine myself to a brief and general\r\ndescription of what I consider requisite for perfection in these\r\nbirds, and firstly as to the golden variety; although, with the\r\nexception of a few observations which I shall make about the cocks,\r\nthe same points are almost requisite in both varieties.\r\n\r\n“In the cocks, the comb should be flat, rose, stretching far back\r\non the head, and ending in a pike--at least an inch and a quarter\r\nin width, and as square in shape as possible; the ear lobe white;\r\nthe neck hackle in the golden variety, of which I am now speaking,\r\nblack fringed with gold; the back, breast, and legs, regularly\r\nspangled, and the larger and brighter green black the spangles the\r\nbetter; the saddle feathers small and spangled; the tail long, full,\r\nand of a brilliant green black; the legs light grey blue; toe nails\r\nwhite. The same description applies to the hens, who should have\r\na flat rose comb, not lopping, but upright; the ground colour of\r\nthe plumage should be a rich red gold or burnt sienna colour. One\r\ngreat point of beauty also, both in the cocks and hens, is that\r\nthe wing should be regularly laced, as in the spangled Polands. The\r\ngreat difficulty in breeding the cocks is the tendency they have to\r\ncome with black breasts and red backs--and for show such birds are\r\nvalueless, although it is said more likely to throw good pullets than\r\nthe spangled breasted birds which are sometimes termed hen-feathered.\r\nThe _silver_ spangled cock should not be hen-feathered, the hackle,\r\nand saddle feathers should be white, the latter very long, the tail\r\nspangled black and white, the breast regularly spangled up to the\r\nthroat, and in colour the clearest white for the ground, and the\r\nbrightest green black for the spangles is requisite. The lacing of\r\nthe wing in this variety is quite a _sine quâ non_, both in the cocks\r\nand hens; and in the latter the tail should be clear white, with\r\nthree or four large circular spangles upon it, but no other dark\r\nmarkings whatever. The neck, back, breast, rump, and legs, should be\r\nregularly spangled, and there should be a total absence of patchiness\r\nin the markings. In both varieties great distinctness of colour\r\nis requisite, and from the delicacy of the plumage the slightest\r\napproach to breeding _in and in_ is sure to make the produce utterly\r\nvalueless. In conclusion, the carriage of the cocks should be lofty\r\nand upright with the breast thrown forward like the Polands; the\r\nweight of the male birds from 5lb. to 6lb., of the hens from 4lb. to\r\n5lb., or a little more.”\r\n\r\nThere is, in addition to the gold and silver spangled, a third\r\nvariety of these fowls, in which the whole plumage is of a glossy\r\ngreen black, the other characters being similar to those above\r\ndescribed; these are termed Black Pheasant Fowls in the north of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe term pheasant fowl, as applied to the spangled Hamburgh, takes\r\nits origin from the crescentic moon shaped markings, which resemble\r\nthose of that bird; and the term Moonies is also sometimes applied to\r\nthem from the same cause.\r\n\r\n_Pencilled Hamburghs._--This variety is also of two colours, golden\r\nand silver, the hens in both should have the feathers of the body\r\ndistinctly pencilled or marked across with several separate bars of\r\nblack, the hackle in both sexes should be perfectly free from dark\r\nmarks, the comb a piked rose, the ear lobe white, and the legs blue\r\nas in the spangled Hamburghs, the tail should be very large and black\r\nor bronzed. The cocks do not show these pencillings, but are white or\r\nbrown in the silver or golden birds respectively. The birds are of a\r\ncompact form, and very graceful sprightly carriage. They do not sit,\r\nbut lay exceedingly well, hence one of their common names, that of\r\nDutch every day layers, they are also known in different parts of the\r\ncountry as Chitteprats, Creoles, or Corals; Bolton bays and grays;\r\nand in some parts of Yorkshire by the erroneous name of Corsican\r\nfowls. Large numbers are imported from Holland, but the birds bred\r\nin this country are much superior in size, retaining, however, their\r\nprofitable characteristics.\r\n\r\nPOLAND FOWLS.--Poland fowls are characterized by the presence of\r\na large top-knot, which, in the cocks, is composed of feathers\r\nresembling those of the hackle, and in the hens forms a dense\r\nglobular tuft; a very small crescent shaped comb is usually present,\r\nrising like two small horns from the arched and dilated nostrils.\r\nSeveral varieties of colour exist; in the black birds there should be\r\nan entire absence of white except in the top-knot, in which the less\r\nblack the better, the chest should be very prominent an fleshy, the\r\nlegs dark, the wattles large and pendulous.\r\n\r\nThe spangled Polands, both gold and silver, are rather larger and\r\nless compact; and in addition to the crest, many possess a large\r\ntufted beard. Other varieties, as buff, white, &c., also exist, but\r\nthey are less frequent. Polands are very good layers, but do not\r\nsit; as table birds they are not surpassed by any variety in quality\r\nand plumpness, although their small size is against them as a market\r\nfowl, and their delicacy as chicken is also a considerable drawback;\r\nfrom the latter circumstance, they will scarcely be found entitled\r\nto rank as profitable poultry, except on dry, sandy, or chalky soil,\r\nand in warm, sheltered situations.\r\n\r\nMALAY FOWLS.--Malays are large leggy fowls, with a very upright\r\ncarriage, small tail and clear legs, their heads and necks are long\r\nand snaky, and distinguished by a small warty comb; the hens are\r\nfair layers and remarkably good sitters and nurses. Malays are of\r\nalmost every variety of colour, black, white, grey, &c., though the\r\nmost common tint is a cinnamon brown. They are not as largely bred\r\nas formerly, for as egg producers they are not very profitable, and\r\ntheir large limbs are against their use as table fowls. What is\r\ntermed the Pheasant Malay originates in a bad cross between the Malay\r\nand spangled Hamburgh, in which the good qualities of both breeds are\r\nsacrificed.\r\n\r\nBANTAMS, SILK FOWLS, FRIZZLED AND RUMPLESS FOWLS, &c., &c., can\r\nhardly be regarded as profitable poultry, but come under the\r\ndescription of fancy fowls. As paying stock, my opinion is in favour\r\nof one or other of the following varieties:--\r\n\r\nFor market fowls for table use, the coloured Dorking is unequalled.\r\n\r\nFor the production of eggs, Hamburghs where there is a free range;\r\nCochins and Spanish where there is less space; the first being the\r\nbest winter layers, the latter yielding the largest eggs.\r\n\r\nMany persons recommend cross breeding fowls for the purpose of\r\nimproving upon certain varieties; it is difficult to see by what\r\ncross the qualities of Dorkings, as table fowls, can be improved; or\r\nthe superior laying properties of Hamburghs, Spanish, and Cochins,\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nTo improve the hardihood of Dorkings some very experienced persons\r\nhave recommended crossing a Malay cock with Dorking hens; in this\r\ncase care must be taken to kill all the cross-bred chicken, as,\r\nif bred from again, a set of variable, worthless mongrels are the\r\nresult. I have myself, however, never seen any cross-bred fowls equal\r\nfor the table to the pure Dorking.\r\n\r\nFor home consumption, yielding numerous eggs, and large size\r\nchicken, Cochins are very valuable; their hardihood, docility, and\r\nmatronly habits, enable a greater number to be reared from the same\r\nnumber of hens, than can be obtained from any other variety; but as\r\npoultry for the market they are of little value.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would strongly recommend persons who are at present\r\nbreeding from common fowls, not to attempt to improve them by the\r\nintroduction of one or two good male birds into the yard, but to\r\nobtain a good stock either by the purchase of birds or eggs, and to\r\nbreed from them alone, avoiding of course all intermarriage between\r\nblood relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe diseases of poultry may perhaps be more conveniently arranged\r\nunder the heads of the different parts that are affected than in any\r\nmore strictly scientific order. We may therefore describe them as\r\naffecting the Skin, Lungs and Air Passages, Digestive System, Egg\r\nOrgans, Brain, and the Organs of Motion.\r\n\r\nSKIN DISEASES.--When fowls are kept on unnatural food, and in\r\nclosely confined, dirty situations, they are very liable to lose\r\nthe feathers of the head and neck from a chronic disease of the\r\nskin. This complaint may be constantly seen in the fowls in the mews\r\nand stableyards in London, where it arises from the dirty, dark\r\nroosting places, and absence of fresh vegetable and insect food. Of\r\ncourse a radical cure is out of the question, unless the unnatural\r\ncircumstances producing the disease are removed; if this is done,\r\nand a five-grain Plummer’s pill given on two or three occasions, at\r\nintervals of three days, the disease is speedily removed, but the\r\nfeathers will not be replaced until the next moulting season.\r\n\r\nIn Cochins which have been highly fed, particularly if peas and\r\ngreaves have formed part of their food, a somewhat similar disease\r\nis often seen; and, as it commences with whiteness of the comb, it\r\nis frequently termed “white comb.” The treatment in severe cases is\r\nsimilar to that previously described; but mild attacks are said to\r\nyield to the application of turmeric mixed with cocoa-nut oil in the\r\nproportion of one part of the former to eight of the latter.\r\n\r\nMoulting, being a natural action, cannot be regarded as a disease,\r\nbut it frequently is much delayed, and the birds evidently suffer in\r\nsuch cases; it is therefore desirable, when fowls are not moulting\r\nfavourably, to treat them as invalids, giving them food which is more\r\nnourishing than usual, such as a little chopped meat, either raw or\r\ncooked, keeping them in a warm and sheltered habitation, &c.\r\n\r\nLice often infest fowls to an extreme degree, and cause a great\r\namount of irritation; this inconvenience may be prevented by giving\r\nthem dry ashes to scuffle in, and keeping the houses clean and well\r\nlime-washed. When they are very abundant, flour of brimstone dusted\r\nunder the feathers will be found a certain remedy; it is conveniently\r\nused if tied up in a piece of coarse muslin, or powdered from a flour\r\ndredger, or if more convenient, a pound or two may be added to the\r\ndust bath.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE LUNGS AND AIR PASSAGES.--Roup is the most serious\r\ndisease occurring in the poultry yard, not only on account of its\r\naffecting large numbers at one time, but also from the fact that\r\nit is not easily subdued by medical treatment; great confusion and\r\ndifference of opinion have occurred from several distinct diseases\r\nhaving been confounded under this name. True roup commences with a\r\nsticky discharge from the nostrils, at first clear, but afterwards\r\nthick and of a very peculiar and offensive smell, the nostrils become\r\npartially or entirely closed, and there is consequently some slight\r\ndifficulty of breathing, and a distention of the loose skin of the\r\nunder jaw may be noticed; froth frequently appears at the inner\r\ncorner of the eye, the lids swell, and in severe cases the sides of\r\nthe face swell greatly, the fowl becoming blind; from the discharge\r\nbeing wiped on the feathers of the side and under the wing, they\r\nbecome matted together; and in addition to these symptoms there is\r\nextreme thirst. Roup is essentially a disease of the membrane lining\r\nthe nose, similar in this respect to glanders in horses; I believe\r\nit to be highly contagious, and unless a roupy fowl is very valuable\r\nwould recommend its being at once killed. I think the disease is\r\noften communicated by the discharge from the nostrils running into\r\nthe water out of which the fowls drink. As to treatment, a roupy\r\nfowl should at once be removed from the yard, placed in a warm dry\r\nroom, the nostrils and eyes sponged with warm water, and a solution\r\nof ten grains of blue vitriol to an ounce of water dropped into the\r\nnostrils, either from the front or through the slit in the roof of\r\nthe mouth, warm stimulating food, as meal or bread and ale, and a\r\nlittle pepper should be given. Remedies given internally seem to have\r\nbut very little effect on the disease, but I think I have seen more\r\nbenefit from half a grain of blue vitriol given once a day in meal\r\nthan from any other medicine.\r\n\r\nCroup, from the similarity of its name is often confounded with Roup,\r\nfrom which, however, it is perfectly distinct, being inflammation\r\nof the wind-pipe, the symptoms are a difficulty of breathing and a\r\nrattling or peculiar noise in the throat, this, in some cases, is\r\neven musical; sometimes thick glairy mucus is coughed up, but there\r\nis never any swelling of the face or discharge from the nostrils, the\r\ndisease is most frequent in damp weather, and yields readily to warm\r\ndry housing, and one-twelfth of a grain of tartar emetic.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the lungs is known by a difficulty of breathing, but\r\nwithout the noise of croup, the same treatment with tartar emetic is\r\nadvisable.\r\n\r\nConsumption, arising from the presence of scrofulous matter in the\r\nlungs, is produced by cold, damp, bad food, and is also inherited\r\nfrom parents; this disease being hereditary, it is worse than useless\r\nto attempt to cure fowls that are affected, as the chicken are\r\ncertain to be tainted with the disease.\r\n\r\nPip is the name given to a dry horny scale which appears on the\r\ntongue, in all those diseases in which the fowl becomes feverish; it\r\nis only a symptom of internal fever and not a disease itself, the\r\nremedy is to remove the real disease causing it.\r\n\r\nGapes in chicken is caused by peculiar parasitic worms adhering to\r\nthe inside of the windpipe; they are readily removed by stripping a\r\nsmall quill of its side feather, except an inch of the end, dipping\r\nit in spirits of turpentine, and inserting it in the wind-pipe; but\r\nas this remedy often excites fatal inflammation, I have suggested\r\nfumigation with the vapour of turpentine, by shutting the chicken up\r\nin a box, with some shavings moistened with the spirit, as long as\r\nthey can withstand the action of the vapour, and the remedy has been\r\nfound very successful.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS are simple in their treatment. A\r\nfowl sometimes becomes crop-bound from overdistending that organ;\r\nwarm water poured down the throat frequently loosens the mass; but,\r\nif necessary, a perpendicular incision may be made at the upper part\r\nof the swelling sufficiently large to extract the swollen food, and\r\nit will be found to close again without the slightest difficulty;\r\nthe fowl should, however, be kept on soft food for several days\r\nafterwards. Inflammation of the stomach, which is situated between\r\nthe crop and the gizzard, is a very frequent cause of death in highly\r\nfed fowls--they mope, refuse to eat, pine away, and die; there is\r\nno cure for the disease, but it is readily prevented by the use of\r\nnatural food--peas, greaves, hemp seed, being rigorously excluded.\r\n\r\nIn Diarrhœa, five grains of chalk, two grains of cayenne, and five\r\ngrains of powdered rhubarb may be given, and if the discharge is\r\nnot speedily checked, a grain of opium and the same quantity of\r\nipecacuanha may be administered every four or six hours.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE EGG ORGANS.--The most important disease of these\r\norgans is inflammation of the egg passage, shewn by the laying\r\nof soft or imperfect eggs; this complaint is readily remedied by\r\ngiving one grain of calomel and one-twelfth of a grain of tartar\r\nemetic, made into a pill with meal; sometimes soft eggs arise from\r\na deficiency of lime, in which case, a little old mortar rubbish\r\nremedies the defect.\r\n\r\nThe calomel and tartar emetic, which I first recommended for this\r\ndisease in the _Cottage Gardener_, has been frequently given in\r\nother diseases, such as inflammation of the stomach, &c., and I need\r\nscarcely say with the effect of aggravating the evil very materially;\r\nthere is no universal poultry medicine.\r\n\r\nDisease of the ovary, or organ in which the yolks are formed, is\r\nnot unfrequent, when the comb and wattles become like those of the\r\ncock, and the hen crows frequently; such birds are generally but\r\nerroneously termed hen-cocks, they must not be confounded with the\r\nhen-feathered cocks spoken of in the article on Hamburghs.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE LIMBS.--Cramp in young chicken from exposure to cold\r\nand damp is very fatal to early hatches, it can be prevented only by\r\nwarmth and dryness.\r\n\r\nLeg weakness, which is most frequent in rapidly growing chicken\r\nand young birds, particularly Cochins, arises from a disproportion\r\nbetween the weight and strength of the animal, the bird in\r\nconsequence, sinks down upon its hocks; I have found four or five\r\ngrains of citrate of iron given daily in meal successful in every\r\ncase in which I have employed it.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the feet, closely resembling gout, I have seen in\r\nmany cases, particularly in Cochins; the feet become very hot and\r\nswell. One grain of calomel at night and three drops of colchicum\r\nwine twice a day, I have found afford considerable relief.\r\n\r\nThe bumble foot of Dorkings, is a swelling occurring in the ball of\r\nthe foot, not attended with heat, but followed by ulceration and\r\na diseased growth. I have found that it may, to a great degree, be\r\nprevented by having the perches broad and low, not above four feet\r\nin height, as the disease is evidently set up in many cases, and\r\nincreased in all, by the violence with which the heavy birds descend\r\nto the ground; from the low vitality of the parts affected, I have\r\nfound that no treatment is attended with any beneficial results.\r\n\r\nBroken wings are best treated by tying the points of the quill\r\nfeathers together in a natural position and keeping the bird in an\r\nempty place, where there is no perch to tempt it to fly. Broken legs\r\nmay be bandaged round by strips of stout brown paper soaked in white\r\nof egg well beaten up with a fork, the leg should be kept steady by\r\ntwo splints of wood until the paper has become dry, when it will be\r\nfound sufficiently firm to remain secure if wound round with a turn\r\nor two of thread.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE BRAIN are not unfrequent in overfed fowls, apoplexy\r\nbeing the most frequent. The birds affected fall suddenly from their\r\nperches and are found dead. Little can be done in the way of cure;\r\nmuch in the way of prevention, by abstaining from unnatural food; in\r\nan actual attack, if the bird is seen before death, it may be bled by\r\nopening the vein on the under side of the wing, but the chances of\r\nrecovery are but small. Paralysis also arises from the same cause.\r\nIn vertigo, which depends on an undue determination of blood to the\r\nbrain, the fowls run round and round or stagger about; letting a\r\nstream of cold water on the head immediately relieves, this should be\r\nfollowed by a grain of calomel or ten of jalap, in severe cases it\r\nmay be necessary to open a vein.\r\n\r\nIn most of the older poultry books certain nostrums, as rue and\r\nbutter, are constantly recommended; rue is a violent irritating\r\nstimulant, and I am not aware of any disease affecting fowls in which\r\nits use is at all likely to be productive of good effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n             King, Printer, 63, Queen Street, Cheapside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Note:\r\n\r\n\r\nWords and phrases in italics are surrounded by underscores, _like\r\nthis_.
