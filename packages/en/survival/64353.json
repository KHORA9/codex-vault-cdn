PUTNAM’S SONS\r\n  NEW YORK AND LONDON\r\n  1913\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFourteen years have passed since the first edition of this book\r\nwas published, and in revising it for this new edition I found\r\nat my disposal an immense mass of new materials, statistical and\r\ndescriptive, and a great number of new works dealing with the\r\ndifferent subjects that are treated in this book. I have thus had an\r\nexcellent opportunity to verify how far the previsions that I had\r\nformulated when I first wrote this book have been confirmed by the\r\nsubsequent economical evolution of the different nations.\r\n\r\nThis verification permits me to affirm that the economical tendencies\r\nthat I had ventured to foreshadow then have only become more and\r\nmore definite since. Everywhere we see the same decentralisation\r\nof industries going on, new nations continually entering the ranks\r\nof those which manufacture for the world market. Each of these\r\nnew-comers endeavours to develop, and succeeds in developing, on its\r\nown territory the principal industries, and thus frees itself from\r\nbeing exploited by other nations, more advanced in their technical\r\nevolution. All nations have made a remarkable progress in this\r\ndirection, as will be seen from the new data that are given in this\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, one sees, with all the great industrial nations,\r\nthe growing tendency and need of developing at home a more intensive\r\nagricultural productivity, either by improving the now existing\r\nmethods of extensive agriculture, by means of small holdings, “inner\r\ncolonisation,” agricultural education, and co-operative work, or by\r\nintroducing different new branches of intensive agriculture. This\r\ncountry is especially offering us at this moment a most instructive\r\nexample of a movement in the said direction. And this movement\r\nwill certainly result, not only in a much-needed increase of the\r\nproductive forces of the nation, which will contribute to free it\r\nfrom the international speculators in food produce, but also in\r\nawakening in the nation a fuller appreciation of the immense value\r\nof its soil, and the desire of repairing the error that has been\r\ncommitted in leaving it in the hands of great land-owners and of\r\nthose who find it now more advantageous to rent the land to be turned\r\ninto shooting preserves. The different steps that are being taken now\r\nfor raising English agriculture and for obtaining from the land a\r\nmuch greater amount of produce are briefly indicated in Chapter V.\r\n\r\nIt is especially in revising the chapters dealing with the small\r\nindustries that I had to incorporate the results of a great number\r\nof new researches. In so doing I was enabled to show that the growth\r\nof an infinite variety of small enterprises by the side of the very\r\ngreat centralised concerns is not showing any signs of abatement. On\r\nthe contrary, the distribution of electrical motive power has given\r\nthem a new impulse. In those places where water power was utilised\r\nfor distributing electric power in the villages, and in those cities\r\nwhere the machinery used for producing electric light during the\r\nnight hours was utilised for supplying motive power during the day,\r\nthe small industries are taking a new development.\r\n\r\nIn this domain I am enabled to add to the present edition the\r\ninteresting results of a work about the small industries in the\r\nUnited Kingdom that I made in 1900. Such a work was only possible\r\nwhen the British Factory Inspectors had published (in 1898, in virtue\r\nof the Factories Act of 1895) their first reports, from which I could\r\ndetermine the hitherto unknown numerical relations between the great\r\nand the small industries in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nUntil then no figures whatever as regards the distribution of\r\noperatives in the large and small factories and workshops of Great\r\nBritain were available; so that when economists spoke of the\r\n“unavoidable” death of the small industries they merely expressed\r\nhypotheses based upon a limited number of observations, which were\r\nchiefly made upon part of the textile industry and metallurgy. Only\r\nafter Mr. Whitelegge had published the first figures from which\r\nreliable conclusions could be drawn was it possible to see how little\r\nsuch wide-reaching conclusions were confirmed by realities. In this\r\ncountry, as everywhere, the small industries continue to exist, and\r\nnew ones continue to appear as a necessary growth, in many important\r\nbranches of national production, by the side of the very great\r\nfactories and huge centralised works. So I add to the chapter on\r\nsmall industries a summary of the work that I had published in the\r\n_Nineteenth Century_ upon this subject.\r\n\r\nAs regards France, the most interesting observations made by M.\r\nArdouin Dumazet during his many years’ travels all over the country\r\ngive me the possibility of showing the remarkable development of\r\nrural industries, and the advantages which were taken from them for\r\nrecent developments in agriculture and horticulture. Besides, the\r\npublication of the statistical results of the French industrial\r\ncensus of 1896 permits me to give now, for France, most remarkable\r\nnumerical data, showing the real relative importance of the great and\r\nthe small industries.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the recent publication of the results of the third\r\nindustrial census made in Germany in 1907 gives me the data for\r\nshowing how the German small industries have been keeping their\r\nground for the last twenty-five years--a subject which I could touch\r\nonly in a general way in the first editions. The results of this\r\ncensus, compared with the two preceding ones, as also some of the\r\nconclusions arrived at by competent German writers, are indicated in\r\nthe Appendix. So also the results recently arrived at in Switzerland\r\nconcerning its home industries.\r\n\r\nAs to the need, generally felt at this moment, of an education which\r\nwould combine a wide scientific instruction with a sound knowledge\r\nof manual work--a question which I treat in the last chapter--it can\r\nbe said that this cause has already been won in this country during\r\nthe last twenty years. The _principle_ is generally recognised by\r\nthis time, although most nations, impoverished as they are by their\r\narmaments, are much too slow in applying the principle in life.\r\n\r\n  P. KROPOTKIN.\r\n\r\n  BRIGHTON, _October_, 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the name of profits, rent, interest upon capital, surplus\r\nvalue, and the like, economists have eagerly discussed the benefits\r\nwhich the owners of land or capital, or some privileged nations,\r\ncan derive, either from the underpaid work of the wage-labourer, or\r\nfrom the inferior position of one class of the community towards\r\nanother class, or from the inferior economical development of one\r\nnation towards another nation. These profits being shared in a very\r\nunequal proportion between the different individuals, classes and\r\nnations engaged in production, considerable pains were taken to study\r\nthe present apportionment of the benefits, and its economical and\r\nmoral consequences, as well as the changes in the present economical\r\norganisation of society which might bring about a more equitable\r\ndistribution of a rapidly accumulating wealth. It is upon questions\r\nrelating to the right to that increment of wealth that the hottest\r\nbattles are now fought between economists of different schools.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the great question--“What have we to produce, and\r\nhow?” necessarily remained in the background. Political economy,\r\nas it gradually emerges from its semi-scientific stage, tends more\r\nand more to become a science devoted to the study of the needs of\r\nmen and of the means of satisfying them with the least possible\r\nwaste of energy,--that is, a sort of physiology of society. But few\r\neconomists, as yet, have recognised that this is the proper domain\r\nof economics, and have attempted to treat their science from this\r\npoint of view. The main subject of social economy--that is, the\r\n_economy of energy required for the satisfaction of human needs_--is\r\nconsequently the last subject which one expects to find treated in a\r\nconcrete form in economical treatises.\r\n\r\nThe following pages are a contribution to a portion of this vast\r\nsubject. They contain a discussion of the advantages which civilised\r\nsocieties could derive from a combination of industrial pursuits with\r\nintensive agriculture, and of brain work with manual work.\r\n\r\nThe importance of such a combination has not escaped the attention of\r\na number of students of social science. It was eagerly discussed some\r\nfifty years ago under the names of “harmonised labour,” “integral\r\neducation,” and so on. It was pointed out at that time that the\r\ngreatest sum total of well-being can be obtained when a variety of\r\nagricultural, industrial and intellectual pursuits are combined in\r\neach community; and that man shows his best when he is in a position\r\nto apply his usually-varied capacities to several pursuits in the\r\nfarm, the workshop, the factory, the study or the studio, instead of\r\nbeing riveted for life to one of these pursuits only.\r\n\r\nAt a much more recent date, in the ’seventies, Herbert Spencer’s\r\ntheory of evolution gave origin in Russia to a remarkable work, _The\r\nTheory of Progress_, by M. M. Mikhailovsky. The part which belongs\r\nin progressive evolution to _differentiation_, and the part which\r\nbelongs in it to an _integration_ of aptitudes and activities, were\r\ndiscussed by the Russian author with depth of thought, and Spencer’s\r\ndifferentiation-formula was accordingly completed.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, out of a number of smaller monographs, I must mention a\r\nsuggestive little book by J. R. Dodge, the United States statistician\r\n(_Farm and Factory: Aids derived by Agriculture from Industries_, New\r\nYork, 1886). The same question was discussed in it from a practical\r\nAmerican point of view.\r\n\r\nHalf a century ago a harmonious union between agricultural and\r\nindustrial pursuits, as also between brain work and manual work,\r\ncould only be a remote desideratum. The conditions under which the\r\nfactory system asserted itself, as well as the obsolete forms of\r\nagriculture which prevailed at that time, prevented such a union\r\nfrom being feasible. Synthetic production was impossible. However,\r\nthe wonderful simplification of the technical processes in both\r\nindustry and agriculture, partly due to an ever-increasing division\r\nof labour--in analogy with what we see in biology--has rendered the\r\nsynthesis possible; and a distinct tendency towards a synthesis of\r\nhuman activities becomes now apparent in modern economical evolution.\r\nThis tendency is analysed in the subsequent chapters--a special\r\nweight being laid upon the present possibilities of agriculture,\r\nwhich are illustrated by a number of examples borrowed from different\r\ncountries, and upon the small industries to which a new impetus is\r\nbeing given by the new methods of transmission of motive power.\r\n\r\nThe substance of these essays was published in 1888-1890 in the\r\n_Nineteenth Century_, and of one of them in the _Forum_. However, the\r\ntendencies indicated therein have been confirmed during the last ten\r\nyears by such a mass of evidence that a very considerable amount of\r\nnew matter had to be introduced, while the chapters on agriculture\r\nand the small trades had to be written anew.\r\n\r\nI take advantage of this opportunity to address my best thanks to\r\nthe editors of the _Nineteenth Century_ and the _Forum_ for their\r\nkind permission of reproducing these essays in a new form, as also\r\nto those friends and correspondents who have aided me in collecting\r\ninformation about agriculture and the petty trades.\r\n\r\n  P.

Even those of our contemporary economists who seldom revert\r\nto the works of the father of political economy, and often forget\r\nthe ideas which inspired them, know that chapter almost by heart, so\r\noften has it been copied and recopied since. It has become an article\r\nof faith; and the economical history of the century which has elapsed\r\nsince Adam Smith wrote has been, so to speak, an actual commentary\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n“Division of labour” was its watchword. And the division and\r\nsubdivision--the permanent subdivision--of functions has been\r\npushed so far as to divide humanity into castes which are almost as\r\nfirmly established as those of old India. We have, first, the broad\r\ndivision into producers and consumers: little-consuming producers\r\non the one hand, little-producing consumers on the other hand.\r\nThen, amidst the former, a series of further subdivisions: the\r\nmanual worker and the intellectual worker, sharply separated from\r\none another to the detriment of both; the agricultural labourers\r\nand the workers in the manufacture; and, amidst the mass of the\r\nlatter, numberless subdivisions again--so minute, indeed, that the\r\nmodern ideal of a workman seems to be a man or a woman, or even a\r\ngirl or a boy, without the knowledge of any handicraft, without any\r\nconception whatever of the industry he or she is employed in, who is\r\nonly capable of making all day long and for a whole life the same\r\ninfinitesimal part of something: who from the age of thirteen to that\r\nof sixty pushes the coal cart at a given spot of the mine or makes\r\nthe spring of a penknife, or “the eighteenth part of a pin.” Mere\r\nservants to some machine of a given description; mere flesh-and-bone\r\nparts of some immense machinery; having no idea how and why the\r\nmachinery performs its rhythmical movements.\r\n\r\nSkilled artisanship is being swept away as a survival of a past\r\ncondemned to disappear. The artist who formerly found æsthetic\r\nenjoyment in the work of his hands is substituted by the human\r\nslave of an iron slave. Nay, even the agricultural labourer, who\r\nformerly used to find a relief from the hardships of his life in\r\nthe home of his ancestors--the future home of his children--in his\r\nlove of the field and in a keen intercourse with nature, even he has\r\nbeen doomed to disappear for the sake of division of labour. He is\r\nan anachronism, we are told; he must be substituted, in a Bonanza\r\nfarm, by an occasional servant hired for the summer, and discharged\r\nas the autumn comes: a tramp who will never again see the field he\r\nhas harvested once in his life. “An affair of a few years,” the\r\neconomists say, “to reform agriculture in accordance with the true\r\nprinciples of division of labour and modern industrial organisation.”\r\n\r\nDazzled with the results obtained by a century of marvellous\r\ninventions, especially in England, our economists and political\r\nmen went still farther in their dreams of division of labour. They\r\nproclaimed the necessity of dividing the whole of humanity into\r\nnational workshops having each of them its own speciality. We were\r\ntaught, for instance, that Hungary and Russia are predestined by\r\nnature to grow corn in order to feed the manufacturing countries;\r\nthat Britain had to provide the world-market with cottons, iron\r\ngoods, and coal; Belgium with woollen cloth; and so on. Nay, within\r\neach nation, each region had to have its own speciality. So it has\r\nbeen for some time since; so it ought to remain. Fortunes have been\r\nmade in this way, and will continue to be made in the same way. It\r\nbeing proclaimed that the wealth of nations is measured by the amount\r\nof profits made by the few, and that the largest profits are made by\r\nmeans of a specialisation of labour, the question was not conceived\r\nto exist as to whether human beings _would_ always submit to such a\r\nspecialisation; whether nations could be specialised like isolated\r\nworkmen. The theory was good for to-day--why should we care for\r\nto-morrow? To-morrow might bring its own theory!\r\n\r\nAnd so it did. The narrow conception of life which consisted in\r\nthinking that _profits_ are the only leading motive of human society,\r\nand the stubborn view which supposes that what has existed yesterday\r\nwould last for ever, proved in disaccordance with the tendencies of\r\nhuman life; and life took another direction. Nobody will deny the\r\nhigh pitch of production which may be attained by specialisation.\r\nBut, precisely in proportion as the work required from the individual\r\nin modern production becomes simpler and easier to be learned, and,\r\ntherefore, also more monotonous and wearisome--the requirements\r\nof the individual for varying his work, for exercising all his\r\ncapacities, become more and more prominent. Humanity perceives that\r\nthere is no advantage for the community in riveting a human being for\r\nall his life to a given spot, in a workshop or a mine; no gain in\r\ndepriving him of such work as would bring him into free intercourse\r\nwith nature, make of him a conscious part of the grand whole, a\r\npartner in the highest enjoyments of science and art, of free work\r\nand creation.\r\n\r\nNations, too, refuse to be specialised. Each nation is a compound\r\naggregate of tastes and inclinations, of wants and resources, of\r\ncapacities and inventive powers. The territory occupied by each\r\nnation is in its turn a most varied texture of soils and climates, of\r\nhills and valleys, of slopes leading to a still greater variety of\r\nterritories and races. Variety is the distinctive feature, both of\r\nthe territory and its inhabitants; and that variety implies a variety\r\nof occupations. Agriculture calls manufactures into existence, and\r\nmanufactures support agriculture. Both are inseparable; and the\r\ncombination, the integration of both brings about the grandest\r\nresults. In proportion as technical knowledge becomes everybody’s\r\nvirtual domain, in proportion as it becomes international, and can be\r\nconcealed no longer, each nation acquires the possibility of applying\r\nthe whole variety of her energies to the whole variety of industrial\r\nand agricultural pursuits. Knowledge ignores artificial political\r\nboundaries. So also do the industries; and the present tendency of\r\nhumanity is to have the greatest possible variety of industries\r\ngathered in each country, in each separate region, side by side with\r\nagriculture. The needs of human agglomerations correspond thus to\r\nthe needs of the individual; and while a _temporary_ division of\r\nfunctions remains the surest guarantee of success in each separate\r\nundertaking, the _permanent_ division is doomed to disappear, and to\r\nbe substituted by a variety of pursuits--intellectual, industrial,\r\nand agricultural--corresponding to the different capacities of the\r\nindividual, as well as to the variety of capacities within every\r\nhuman aggregate.\r\n\r\nWhen we thus revert from the scholastics of our text-books, and\r\nexamine human life as a whole, we soon discover that, while all the\r\nbenefits of a temporary division of labour must be maintained, it is\r\nhigh time to claim those of the _integration of labour_. Political\r\neconomy has hitherto insisted chiefly upon _division_. We proclaim\r\n_integration_; and we maintain that the ideal of society--that is,\r\nthe state towards which society is already marching--is a society\r\nof integrated, combined labour. A society where each individual\r\nis a producer of both manual and intellectual work; where each\r\nable-bodied human being is a worker, and where each worker works both\r\nin the field and the industrial workshop; where every aggregation of\r\nindividuals, large enough to dispose of a certain variety of natural\r\nresources--it may be a nation, or rather a region--produces and\r\nitself consumes most of its own agricultural and manufactured produce.\r\n\r\nOf course, as long as society remains organised so as to permit the\r\nowners of the land and capital to appropriate for themselves, under\r\nthe protection of the State and historical rights, the yearly surplus\r\nof human production, no such change can be thoroughly accomplished.\r\nBut the present industrial system, based upon a permanent\r\nspecialisation of functions, already bears in itself the germs of\r\nits proper ruin. The industrial crises, which grow more acute and\r\nprotracted, and are rendered still worse and still more acute by the\r\narmaments and wars implied by the present system, are rendering its\r\nmaintenance more and more difficult. Moreover, the workers plainly\r\nmanifest their intention to support no longer patiently the misery\r\noccasioned by each crisis. And each crisis accelerates the day when\r\nthe present institutions of individual property and production will\r\nbe shaken to their foundations with such internal struggles as will\r\ndepend upon the more or less good sense of the now privileged classes.\r\n\r\nBut we maintain also that any socialist attempt at remodelling the\r\npresent relations between Capital and Labour will be a failure, if it\r\ndoes not take into account the above tendencies towards integration.\r\nThese tendencies have not yet received, in our opinion, due attention\r\nfrom the different socialist schools--but they must. A reorganised\r\nsociety will have to abandon the fallacy of nations specialised for\r\nthe production of either agricultural or manufactured produce. It\r\nwill have to rely on itself for the production of food and many,\r\nif not most, of the raw materials; it must find the best means of\r\ncombining agriculture with manufacture--the work in the field with a\r\ndecentralised industry; and it will have to provide for “integrated\r\neducation,” which education alone, by teaching both science and\r\nhandicraft from earliest childhood, can give to society the men and\r\nwomen it really needs.\r\n\r\nEach nation--her own agriculturist and manufacturer; each\r\nindividual working in the field and in some industrial art; each\r\nindividual combining scientific knowledge with the knowledge of a\r\nhandicraft--such is, we affirm, the present tendency of civilised\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe prodigious growth of industries in Great Britain, and the\r\nsimultaneous development of the international traffic which now\r\npermits the transport of raw materials and articles of food on a\r\ngigantic scale, have created the impression that a few nations of\r\nWest Europe were destined to become _the_ manufacturers of the world.\r\nThey need only--it was argued--to supply the market with manufactured\r\ngoods, and they will draw from all over the surface of the earth\r\nthe food they cannot grow themselves, as well as the raw materials\r\nthey need for their manufactures. The steadily increasing speed of\r\ntrans-oceanic communications and the steadily increasing facilities\r\nof shipping have contributed to enforce the above impression. If we\r\ntake the enthusiastic pictures of international traffic, drawn in\r\nsuch a masterly way by Neumann Spallart--the statistician and almost\r\nthe poet of the world-trade--we are inclined indeed to fall into\r\necstasy before the results achieved. “Why shall we grow corn, rear\r\noxen and sheep, and cultivate orchards, go through the painful work\r\nof the labourer and the farmer, and anxiously watch the sky in fear\r\nof a bad crop, when we can get, with much less pain, mountains of\r\ncorn from India, America, Hungary, or Russia, meat from New Zealand,\r\nvegetables from the Azores, apples from Canada, grapes from Malaga,\r\nand so on?” exclaim the West Europeans. “Already now,” they say,\r\n“our food consists, even in modest households, of produce gathered\r\nfrom all over the globe. Our cloth is made out of fibres grown and\r\nwool sheared in all parts of the world. The prairies of America and\r\nAustralia; the mountains and steppes of Asia; the frozen wildernesses\r\nof the Arctic regions; the deserts of Africa and the depths of\r\nthe oceans; the tropics and the lands of the midnight sun are our\r\ntributaries. All races of men contribute their share in supplying\r\nus with our staple food and luxuries, with plain clothing and fancy\r\ndress, while we are sending them in exchange the produce of our\r\nhigher intelligence, our technical knowledge, our powerful industrial\r\nand commercial organising capacities! Is it not a grand sight, this\r\nbusy and intricate exchange of produce all over the earth which has\r\nsuddenly grown up within a few years?”\r\n\r\nGrand it may be, but is it not a mere nightmare? Is it necessary? At\r\nwhat cost has it been obtained, and how long will it last?\r\n\r\nLet us turn a hundred years back. France lay bleeding at the end of\r\nthe Napoleonic wars. Her young industry, which had begun to grow\r\nby the end of the 18th century, was crushed down. Germany, Italy\r\nwere powerless in the industrial field. The armies of the great\r\nRepublic had struck a mortal blow to serfdom on the Continent; but\r\nwith the return of reaction efforts were made to revive the decaying\r\ninstitution, and serfdom meant no industry worth speaking of. The\r\nterrible wars between France and England, which wars are often\r\nexplained by merely political causes, had a much deeper meaning--an\r\neconomical meaning. They were wars for the supremacy on the world\r\nmarket, wars against French industry and commerce, supported by a\r\nstrong navy which France had begun to build--and Britain won the\r\nbattle. She became supreme on the seas. Bordeaux was no more a rival\r\nto London; as to the French industries, they seemed to be killed in\r\nthe bud. And, aided by the powerful impulse given to natural sciences\r\nand technology by a great era of inventions, finding no serious\r\ncompetitors in Europe, Britain began to develop her manufactures. To\r\nproduce on a large scale in immense quantities became the watchword.\r\nThe necessary human forces were at hand in the peasantry, partly\r\ndriven by force from the land, partly attracted to the cities by\r\nhigh wages. The necessary machinery was created, and the British\r\nproduction of manufactured goods went on at a gigantic pace. In the\r\ncourse of less than seventy years--from 1810 to 1878--the output of\r\ncoal grew from 10 to 133,000,000 tons; the imports of raw materials\r\nrose from 30 to 380,000,000 tons; and the exports of manufactured\r\ngoods from 46 to 200,000,000 pounds. The tonnage of the commercial\r\nfleet was nearly trebled. Fifteen thousand miles of railways were\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to repeat now at what a cost the above results were\r\nachieved. The terrible revelations of the parliamentary commissions\r\nof 1840-1842 as to the atrocious condition of the manufacturing\r\nclasses, the tales of “cleared estates,” and kidnapped children\r\nare still fresh in the memory. They will remain standing monuments\r\nfor showing by what means the great industry was implanted in\r\nthis country. But the accumulation of wealth in the hands of\r\nthe privileged classes was going on at a speed never dreamed of\r\nbefore. The incredible riches which now astonish the foreigner\r\nin the private houses of England were accumulated during that\r\nperiod; the exceedingly expensive standard of life which makes a\r\nperson considered rich on the Continent appear as only of modest\r\nmeans in Britain was introduced during that time. The taxed\r\nproperty alone doubled during the last thirty years of the above\r\nperiod, while during the same years (1810 to 1878) no less than\r\n£1,112,000,000--nearly £2,000,000,000 by this time--was invested\r\nby English capitalists either in foreign industries or in foreign\r\nloans.[1]\r\n\r\nBut the monopoly of industrial production could not remain with\r\nEngland for ever. Neither industrial knowledge nor enterprise could\r\nbe kept for ever as a privilege of these islands. Necessarily,\r\nfatally, they began to cross the Channel and spread over the\r\nContinent. The Great Revolution had created in France a numerous\r\nclass of peasant proprietors, who enjoyed nearly half a century of\r\na comparative well-being, or, at least, of a guaranteed labour. The\r\nranks of homeless town workers increased slowly. But the middle-class\r\nrevolution of 1789-1793 had already made a distinction between the\r\npeasant householders and the village _prolétaires_, and, by favouring\r\nthe former to the detriment of the latter, it compelled the labourers\r\nwho had no household nor land to abandon their villages, and thus to\r\nform the first nucleus of working classes given up to the mercy of\r\nmanufacturers. Moreover, the peasant-proprietors themselves, after\r\nhaving enjoyed a period of undeniable prosperity, began in their\r\nturn to feel the pressure of bad times, and their children were\r\ncompelled to look for employment in manufactures. Wars and revolution\r\nhad checked the growth of industry; but it began to grow again\r\nduring the second half of our century; it developed, it improved;\r\nand now, notwithstanding the loss of Alsace, France is no longer the\r\ntributary to England for manufactured produce which she was sixty\r\nyears ago. To-day her exports of manufactured goods are valued at\r\nnearly one-half of those of Great Britain, and two-thirds of them are\r\ntextiles; while her imports of the same consist chiefly of the finer\r\nsorts of cotton and woollen yarn--partly re-exported as stuffs--and\r\na small quantity of woollen goods. For her own consumption France\r\nshows a decided tendency towards becoming entirely a self-supporting\r\ncountry, and for the sale of her manufactured goods she is tending\r\nto rely, not on her colonies, but especially on her own wealthy home\r\nmarket.[2]\r\n\r\nGermany follows the same lines. During the last fifty years, and\r\nespecially since the last war, her industry has undergone a thorough\r\nre-organisation. Her population having rapidly increased from forty\r\nto sixty millions, this increment went entirely to increase the\r\nurban population--without taking hands from agriculture--and in the\r\ncities it went to increase the population engaged in industry.\r\nHer industrial machinery has been thoroughly improved, and her\r\nnew-born manufactures are supplied now with a machinery which mostly\r\nrepresents the last word of technical progress. She has plenty of\r\nworkmen and technologists endowed with a superior technical and\r\nscientific education; and in an army of learned chemists, physicists\r\nand engineers her industry has a most powerful and intelligent aid,\r\nboth for directly improving it and for spreading in the country\r\nserious scientific and technical knowledge. As a whole, Germany\r\noffers now the spectacle of a nation in a period of _Aufschwung_, of\r\na sudden development, with all the forces of a new start in every\r\ndomain of life. Fifty years ago she was a customer to England. Now\r\nshe is already a competitor in the European and Asiatic markets,\r\nand at the present speedy rate of growth of her industries, her\r\ncompetition will soon be felt even more acutely than it is already\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the wave of industrial production, after having had\r\nits origin in the north-west of Europe, spreads towards the east\r\nand south-east, always covering a wider circle. And, in proportion\r\nas it advances east, and penetrates into younger countries, it\r\nimplants there all the improvements due to a century of mechanical\r\nand chemical inventions; it borrows from science all the help that\r\nscience can give to industry; and it finds populations eager to grasp\r\nthe last results of modern knowledge. The new manufactures of Germany\r\nbegin where Manchester arrived after a century of experiments and\r\ngropings; and Russia begins where Manchester and Saxony have now\r\nreached. Russia, in her turn, tries to emancipate herself from her\r\ndependency upon Western Europe, and rapidly begins to manufacture all\r\nthose goods she formerly used to import, either from Britain or from\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nProtective duties may, perhaps, sometimes help the birth of new\r\nindustries: always at the expense of some other growing industries,\r\nand always checking the improvement of those which already exist;\r\nbut the decentralisation of manufactures goes on with or without\r\nprotective duties--I should even say, notwithstanding the protective\r\nduties. Austria, Hungary and Italy follow the same lines--they\r\ndevelop their home industries--and even Spain and Servia are going\r\nto join the family of manufacturing nations. Nay, even India, even\r\nBrazil and Mexico, supported by English, French, and German capital\r\nand knowledge, begin to start home industries on their respective\r\nsoils. Finally, a terrible competitor to all European manufacturing\r\ncountries has grown up of late in the United States. In proportion\r\nas technical education spreads more and more widely, manufactures\r\ngrow in the States; and they do grow at such a speed--an American\r\nspeed--that in a very few years the now neutral markets will be\r\ninvaded by American goods.\r\n\r\nThe monopoly of the first comers on the industrial field has ceased\r\nto exist. And it will exist no more, whatever may be the spasmodic\r\nefforts made to return to a state of things already belonging to the\r\ndomain of history. New ways, new issues must be looked for: the past\r\n_has_ lived, and it will live no more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore going farther, let me illustrate the march of industries\r\ntowards the east by a few figures. And, to begin with, let me take\r\nthe example of Russia. Not because I know it better, but because\r\nRussia is one of the latest comers on the industrial field. Fifty\r\nyears ago she was considered as the ideal of an agricultural nation,\r\ndoomed by nature itself to supply other nations with food, and to\r\ndraw her manufactured goods from the west. So it was, indeed--but it\r\nis so no more.\r\n\r\nIn 1861--the year of the emancipation of the serfs--Russia and Poland\r\nhad only 14,060 manufactories, which produced every year the value\r\nof 296,000,000 roubles (about £36,000,000). Twenty years later the\r\nnumber of establishments rose to 35,160, and their yearly production\r\nbecame nearly four times the above, _i.e._, 1,305,000,000 roubles\r\n(about £131,000,000); and in 1894, although the census left the\r\nsmaller manufactures and all the industries which pay excise duties\r\n(sugar, spirits, matches) out of account, the aggregate production\r\nin the Empire reached already 1,759,000,000 roubles, _i.e._,\r\n£180,000,000. The most noteworthy feature of this increase is, that\r\nwhile the number of workmen employed in the manufactures has not even\r\ndoubled since 1861 (it attained 1,555,000 in 1894, and 1,902,750\r\nin 1910), the production per workman has more than trebled in the\r\nleading industries. The average was less than £70 per annum in 1861;\r\nit reaches now £219. The increase of production is thus chiefly due\r\nto the improvement of machinery.[3]\r\n\r\nIf we take, however, separate branches, and especially the textile\r\nindustries and the machinery works, the progress appears still more\r\nstriking. Thus, if we consider the eighteen years which preceded 1879\r\n(when the import duties were increased by nearly 30 per cent. and a\r\nprotective policy was definitely adopted), we find that even without\r\nprotective duties the bulk of production in cottons increased three\r\ntimes, while the number of workers employed in that industry rose by\r\nonly 25 per cent. The yearly production of each worker had thus grown\r\nfrom £45 to £117. During the next nine years (1880-1889) the yearly\r\nreturns were more than doubled, attaining the respectable figure of\r\n£49,000,000 in money and 3,200,000 cwts. in bulk. Since that time,\r\nfrom 1890 to 1900, it has doubled once more, the quantity of raw\r\ncotton worked in the Russian factories having increased from 255,000\r\nto 520,700 cwts., and the number of spindles having grown from\r\n3,457,000 to 6,646,000 in 1900, and to 8,306,000 in 1910. It must\r\nalso be remarked that, with a population of 165,000,000 inhabitants,\r\nthe home market for Russian cottons is almost unlimited; while some\r\ncottons are also exported to Persia and Central Asia.[4]\r\n\r\nTrue, that the finest sorts of yarn, as well as sewing cotton, have\r\nstill to be imported. But Lancashire manufacturers will soon see\r\nto that; they now plant their mills in Russia. Two large mills for\r\nspinning the finest sorts of cotton yarn were opened in Russia in\r\n1897, with the aid of English capital and English engineers, and\r\na factory for making thin wire for cotton-carding has lately been\r\nopened at Moscow by a well-known Manchester manufacturer. Several\r\nmore have followed since. Capital is international and, protection or\r\nno protection, it crosses the frontiers.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of woollens. In this branch Russia was for a certain\r\ntime relatively backward. However, wool-combing, spinning and weaving\r\nmills, provided with the best modern plant, were built every year in\r\nRussia and Poland by English, German and Belgian mill-owners; so that\r\nnow four-fifths of the ordinary wool, and as much of the finer sorts\r\nobtainable in Russia, are combed and spun at home--one fifth part\r\nonly of each being sent abroad. The times when Russia was known as\r\nan exporter of raw wool are thus irretrievably gone.[5]\r\n\r\nIn machinery works no comparison can even be made between nowadays\r\nand 1861, or even 1870. Thanks to English and French engineers\r\nto begin with, and afterwards to technical progress within the\r\ncountry itself, Russia needs no longer to import any part of her\r\nrailway plant. And as to agricultural machinery, we know, from\r\nseveral British Consular reports, that Russian reapers and ploughs\r\nsuccessfully compete with the same implements of both American\r\nand English make. During the years 1880 to 1890, this branch of\r\nmanufactures has largely developed in the Southern Urals (as a\r\nvillage industry, brought into existence by the Krasnoufimsk\r\nTechnical School of the local District Council, or _zemstvo_), and\r\nespecially on the plains sloping towards the Sea of Azov. About\r\nthis last region Vice-Consul Green reported, in 1894, as follows:\r\n“Besides some eight or ten factories of importance,” he wrote, “the\r\nwhole of the consular district is now studded with small engineering\r\nworks, engaged chiefly in the manufacture of agricultural machines\r\nand implements, most of them having their own foundries.... The\r\ntown of Berdyansk,” he added, “can now boast of the largest reaper\r\nmanufactory in Europe, capable of turning out three thousand machines\r\nannually.”[6]\r\n\r\nLet me add that the above-mentioned figures, including only those\r\nmanufactures which show a yearly return of more than £200, do not\r\ninclude the immense variety of domestic trades which also have\r\nconsiderably grown of late, side by side with the manufactures. The\r\ndomestic industries--so characteristic of Russia, and so necessary\r\nunder her climate--occupy now more than 7,500,000 peasants, and\r\ntheir aggregate production was estimated a few years ago at more\r\nthan the aggregate production of all the manufactures. It exceeded\r\n£180,000,000 per annum. I shall have an occasion to return later on\r\nto this subject, so that I shall be sober of figures, and merely\r\nsay that even in the chief manufacturing provinces of Russia round\r\nabout Moscow domestic weaving--for the trade--shows a yearly return\r\nof £4,500,000; and that even in Northern Caucasia, where the petty\r\ntrades are of a recent origin, there are, in the peasants’ houses,\r\n45,000 looms showing a yearly production of £200,000.\r\n\r\nAs to the mining industries, notwithstanding over-protection, and\r\nnotwithstanding the competition of fuelwood and naphtha,[7] the\r\noutput of the coal mines of Russia has doubled during the years\r\n1896-1904, and in Poland it has increased fourfold.[8] Nearly all\r\nsteel, three-quarters of the iron, and two-thirds of the pig-iron\r\nused in Russia are home produce, and the eight Russian works for\r\nthe manufacture of steel rails are strong enough to throw on the\r\nmarket over 10,000,000 cwts. of rails every year (10,068,000 cwts. in\r\n1910).[9]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder, therefore, that the imports of manufactured goods\r\ninto Russia are so insignificant, and that since 1870--that is,\r\nnine years before the general increase of duties--the proportion\r\nof manufactured goods to the aggregate imports has been on a steady\r\ndecrease. Manufactured goods make now only one-fifth of the imports,\r\nand only occasionally rise to one-third, as was the case in 1910--a\r\nyear of maximal imports. Besides, while the imports of Britain into\r\nRussia were valued at £16,300,000 in 1872, they were only £6,884,500\r\nto £11,320,000 in the years 1894 to 1909. Out of them, manufactured\r\ngoods were valued at a little more than £2,000,000--the remainder\r\nbeing either articles of food or raw and half-manufactured goods\r\n(metals, yarn and so on). They reached £15,300,000 in 1910--a year\r\nof maximum, and consisted chiefly of machinery and coal. In fact,\r\nthe imports of British home produce have declined in the course of\r\nten years from £8,800,000 to £5,000,000, so as to reduce in 1910\r\nthe value of British manufactured goods imported into Russia to\r\nthe following trifling items: machinery, £1,320,000; cottons and\r\ncotton yarn, £360,000; woollens and woollen yarn, £480,000; chemical\r\nproduce, £476,000; and so on. But the depreciation of British goods\r\nimported into Russia is still more striking. Thus, in 1876 Russia\r\nimported 8,000,000 cwts. of British metals, and they were paid\r\n£6,000,000; but in 1884, although the same quantity was imported, the\r\namount paid was only £3,400,000. And the same depreciation is seen\r\nfor all imported goods, although not always in the same proportion.\r\n\r\nIt would be a gross error to imagine that the decline of foreign\r\nimports is mainly due to high protective duties. The decline of\r\nimports is much better explained by the growth of home industries.\r\nThe protective duties have no doubt contributed (together with other\r\ncauses) towards attracting German and English manufacturers to Poland\r\nand Russia. Lodz--the Manchester of Poland--is quite a German city,\r\nand the Russian trade directories are full of English and German\r\nnames. English and German capitalists, English engineers and foremen,\r\nhave planted within Russia the improved cotton manufactures of\r\ntheir mother countries; they are busy now in improving the woollen\r\nindustries and the production of machinery; while Belgians have\r\nrapidly created a great iron industry in South Russia. There is\r\nnow not the slightest doubt--and this opinion is shared, not only\r\nby economists, but also by several Russian manufacturers--that a\r\nfree-trade policy would not check the further growth of industries in\r\nRussia. It would only reduce the high profits of those manufacturers\r\nwho do not improve their factories and chiefly rely upon cheap labour\r\nand long hours.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as soon as Russia succeeds in obtaining more freedom, a\r\nfurther growth of her industries will immediately follow. Technical\r\neducation--which, strange to say, was for a long time systematically\r\nsuppressed by the Government--would rapidly grow and spread; and in a\r\nfew years, with her natural resources and her laborious youth, which\r\neven now tries to combine workmanship with science, Russia would\r\nsee her industrial powers increase tenfold. She _farà da sè_ in the\r\nindustrial field. She will manufacture all she needs; and yet she\r\nwill remain an agricultural nation.\r\n\r\nAt the present time only a little more than 1,500,000 men and women,\r\nout of the 112,000,000 strong population of European Russia, work in\r\nmanufactures, and 7,500,000 combine agriculture with manufacturing.\r\nThis figure may treble without Russia ceasing to be an agricultural\r\nnation; but if it be trebled, there will be no room for imported\r\nmanufactured goods, because an agricultural country can produce\r\nthem cheaper than those countries which live on imported food. Let\r\nus not forget that in the United Kingdom 1,087,200 persons, all\r\ntaken, are employed in _all_ the textile industries of England,\r\nScotland, Ireland and Wales, and that _only_ 300,000 out of them\r\nare males above eighteen years of age (311,000 in 1907); that these\r\nworkpeople keep going 53,000,000 spindles and more than 700,000\r\nlooms in the cotton factories only; and that the yearly production\r\nof textiles during the last few years was so formidable that it\r\nrepresented a value of £200,000,000, and that the average value of\r\ntextiles exported every year attained £136,257,500 in 1905-1910--to\r\nsay nothing of the £163,400,000 reached in the extraordinary year of\r\n1911.[10]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe same is still more true with regard to other European nations,\r\nmuch more advanced in their industrial development, and especially\r\nwith regard to Germany. So much has been written about the\r\ncompetition which Germany offers to British trade, even in the\r\nBritish markets, and so much can be learned about it from a mere\r\ninspection of the London shops, that I need not enter into lengthy\r\ndetails. Several articles in reviews; the correspondence exchanged\r\non the subject in _The Daily Telegraph_ in August, 1886; numerous\r\nconsular reports, regularly summed up in the leading newspapers, and\r\nstill more impressive when consulted in originals; and, finally,\r\npolitical speeches, have familiarised the public opinion of this\r\ncountry with the importance and the powers of German competition.[11]\r\nMoreover, the forces which German industry borrows from the technical\r\ntraining of her workmen, engineers and numerous scientific men, have\r\nbeen so often discussed by the promoters of technical education in\r\nEngland that the sudden growth of Germany as an industrial power can\r\nbe denied no more.\r\n\r\nWhere half a century was required in olden times to develop an\r\nindustry, a few years are sufficient now. In the year 1864 only\r\n160,000 cwts. of raw cotton were imported into Germany, and only\r\n16,000 cwts. of cotton goods were exported; cotton spinning and\r\nweaving were mostly insignificant home industries. Twenty years\r\nlater the imports of raw cotton were already 3,600,000 cwts., and\r\nin another twenty years they rose to 7,400,000 cwts.; while the\r\nexports of cottons and yarn, which were valued at £3,600,000 in\r\n1883, and £7,662,000 in 1893, attained £19,000,000 in 1905. A great\r\nindustry was thus created in less than thirty years, and has been\r\ngrowing since. The necessary technical skill was developed, and at\r\nthe present time Germany remains tributary to Lancashire for the\r\nfinest sorts of yarn only. However, it is very probable that even\r\nthis disadvantage will soon be equalised.[12] Very fine spinning\r\nmills have lately been erected, and the emancipation from Liverpool,\r\nby means of a cotton exchange established at Bremen, is in fair\r\nprogress.[13]\r\n\r\nIn the woollen trade we see the same rapid increase, and in 1910 the\r\nvalue of the exports of woollen goods attained £13,152,500 (against\r\n£8,220,300 in 1894), out of which £1,799,000 worth were sent on the\r\naverage to the United Kingdom during the years 1906-1910.[14] The\r\nflax industry has grown at a still speedier rate, and as regards\r\nsilks Germany is second only to France.\r\n\r\nThe progress realised in the German chemical trade is well known,\r\nand it is only too badly felt in Scotland and Northumberland; while\r\nthe reports on the German iron and steel industries which one finds\r\nin the publications of the Iron and Steel Institute and in the\r\ninquiry which was made by the British Iron Trade Association show how\r\nformidably the production of pig-iron and of finished iron has grown\r\nin Germany since 1871. (See Appendix D.) No wonder that the imports\r\nof iron and steel into Germany were reduced by one-half during the\r\ntwenty years, 1874-1894, while the exports grew nearly four times.\r\nAs to the machinery works, if the Germans have committed the error\r\nof too slavishly copying English patterns, instead of taking a new\r\ndeparture, and of creating new patterns, as the Americans did, we\r\nmust still recognise that their copies are good and that they very\r\nsuccessfully compete in cheapness with the tools and machinery\r\nproduced in this country. (See Appendix E.) I hardly need mention the\r\nsuperior make of German scientific apparatus. It is well known to\r\nscientific men, even in France.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the above, the imports of manufactured goods into\r\nGermany are, as a rule, in decline. The aggregate imports of textiles\r\n(inclusive of yarn) stand so low as to be compensated by nearly\r\nequal values of exports. And there is no doubt that not only the\r\nGerman markets for textiles will be soon lost for other manufacturing\r\ncountries, but that German competition will be felt stronger and\r\nstronger both in the neutral markets and those of Western Europe.\r\nOne can easily win applause from uninformed auditories by exclaiming\r\nwith more or less pathos that German produce can _never_ equal the\r\nEnglish! The fact is, that it competes in cheapness, and sometimes\r\nalso--where it is needed--in an equally good workmanship; and this\r\ncircumstance is due to many causes.\r\n\r\nThe “cheap labour” cause, so often alluded to in discussions about\r\n“German competition,” which take place in this country and in France,\r\nmust be dismissed by this time, since it has been well proved by\r\nso many recent investigations that low wages and long hours do not\r\nnecessarily mean cheap produce. Cheap labour and protection simply\r\nmean the possibility for a number of employers to continue working\r\nwith obsolete and bad machinery; but in highly developed staple\r\nindustries, such as the cotton and the iron industries, the cheapest\r\nproduce is obtained with high wages, short hours and the best\r\nmachinery. When the number of operatives which is required for each\r\n1000 spindles can vary from seventeen (in many Russian factories)\r\nto three (in England), and when one weaver can look either after\r\ntwenty Northrop machine-looms, as we see it in the United States, or\r\nafter two machine-looms only, as it is the case in backward mills,\r\nthen it is evident that no reduction of wages can compensate for\r\nthat immense difference. Consequently, in the best German cotton\r\nmills and ironworks the wages of the worker (we know it directly for\r\nthe ironworks from the above-mentioned inquiry of the British Iron\r\nTrade Association) are not lower than they are in Great Britain. All\r\nthat can be said is, that the worker in Germany gets more for his\r\nwages than he gets in this country--the paradise of the middleman--a\r\nparadise which it will remain so long as it lives chiefly on imported\r\nfood produce.\r\n\r\nThe chief reason for the successes of Germany in the industrial field\r\nis the same as it is for the United States. Both countries have only\r\nlately entered the industrial phase of their development, and they\r\nhave entered it with all the energy of youth. Both countries enjoy\r\na widely-spread scientifically-technical--or, at least, concrete\r\nscientific--education. In both countries manufactories are built\r\naccording to the newest and best models which have been worked out\r\nelsewhere; and both countries are in a period of awakening in all\r\nbranches of activity--literature and science, industry and commerce.\r\nThey enter now on the same phase in which Great Britain was in the\r\nfirst half of the nineteenth century, when British workers took such\r\na large part in the invention of the wonderful modern machinery.\r\n\r\nWe have simply before us a fact of _the consecutive development of\r\nnations_. And instead of decrying or opposing it, it would be much\r\nbetter to see whether the two pioneers of the great industry--Britain\r\nand France--cannot take a new initiative and do something new again;\r\nwhether an issue for the creative genius of these two nations must\r\nnot be sought for in a new direction--namely, the utilisation of both\r\nthe land and the industrial powers of man for securing well-being to\r\nthe whole nation instead of to the few.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See Appendix A.\r\n\r\n[2] See Appendix B.\r\n\r\n[3] For the last few years, since the Japanese war, the figures\r\nwere uncertain. It appeared, however, in 1910, that there were in\r\nthe empire, including the industries paying an excise duty, 19,983\r\nestablishments, employing 2,253,790 persons, and showing a yearly\r\nproduction of 4,565,400,000 roubles (£494,600,000). Out of them,\r\nthe industrial establishments under the factory inspectors in\r\nEuropean Russia proper, Poland, and the four northern provinces of\r\nCaucasia numbered 15,720, employing 1,951,955 workpeople, out of whom\r\n1,227,360 were men, 521,236 women, and 203,359 children.\r\n\r\n[4] The yearly imports of raw cotton from Central Asia and\r\nTranscaucasia represent, as a rule, about one-tenth part of the total\r\nimports of raw cotton (£1,086,000, as against £11,923,000 in 1910).\r\nThey are quite a recent growth, the first plantations of the American\r\ncotton tree having been introduced in Turkestan by the Russians, as\r\nwell as the first sorting and pressing establishments. The relative\r\ncheapness of the plain cottons in Russia, and the good qualities\r\nof the printed cottons, attracted the attention of the British\r\nCommissioner at the Nijni Novgorod Exhibition in 1897, and are spoken\r\nof at some length in his report.\r\n\r\n[5] The yearly production of the 1,037 woollen mills of Russia and\r\nPoland (149,850 workpeople) was valued at about £25,000,000 in 1910,\r\nas against £12,000,000 in 1894.\r\n\r\n[6] Report of Vice-Consul Green, _The Economist_, 9th June, 1894:\r\n“Reapers of a special type, sold at £15 to £17, are durable and go\r\nthrough more work than either the English or the American reapers.”\r\nIn the year 1893, 20,000 reaping machines, 50,000 ploughs, and so on,\r\nwere sold in that district only, representing a value of £822,000.\r\nWere it not for the simply prohibitive duties imposed upon foreign\r\npig-iron (two and a half times its price in the London market), this\r\nindustry would have taken a still greater development. But in order\r\nto protect the home iron industry--which consequently continued\r\nto cling to obsolete forms in the Urals--a duty of 61s. a ton of\r\nimported pig-iron was levied. The consequences of this policy for\r\nRussian agriculture, railways and State’s budget have been discussed\r\nin full in a work by A. A. Radzig, _The Iron Industry of the World_.\r\nSt. Petersburg, 1896 (Russian).\r\n\r\n[7] Out of the 1,500 steamers which ply on Russian rivers one-quarter\r\nare heated with naphtha, and one-half with wood; wood is also the\r\nchief fuel of the railways and ironworks in the Urals.\r\n\r\n[8] The output was, in 1910, 24,146,000 tons in European Russia, and\r\n1,065,000 tons in Siberia.\r\n\r\n[9] See Appendix C.\r\n\r\n[10] Here are the figures obtained by the official census of 1908. In\r\nall the cotton industry, only 220,563 men (including boys), 262,245\r\nwomen, and 90,061 girls less than eighteen years old were employed.\r\nThey produced 6,417,798,000 yards of unbleached gray, and 611,824,000\r\nyards of bleached white and coloured cottons--that is, 160 yards\r\nper head of population--and 1,507,381,000 lb. of yarn, valued\r\n£96,000,000. We have thus 12,271 yards of cotton, and 2,631 lb. of\r\nyarn per person of workpeople employed. For woollens and worsted\r\nthere were 112,438 men and boys, 111,492 women, and 34,087 girls\r\nunder eighteen. The value (incomplete) of the woven goods was about\r\n£40,250,000, and that of the yarn about £21,000,000. These figures\r\nare most instructive, as they show how much man can produce with the\r\npresent machinery. Unfortunately, the real productivity in a modern\r\nfactory is not yet understood by the economists. Thus, we saw lately\r\nRussian economists very seriously maintaining that it was necessary\r\nto “proletarize” the peasants (about 100,000,000) in order to create\r\na great industry. We see now that if one-fourth, or even one-fifth,\r\npart only of the yearly increase of the population took to industry\r\n(as it has done in Germany), Russian factories would soon produce\r\nsuch quantities of all sorts of manufactured goods, that they would\r\nbe able to supply with them 400 or 500 million people, in addition to\r\nthe population of the Russian Empire.\r\n\r\n[11] Many facts in point have also been collected in a little book,\r\n_Made in Germany_, by E. E. Williams. Unhappily, the facts relative\r\nto the recent industrial development of Germany are so often used\r\nin a partisan spirit in order to promote protection that their real\r\nimportance is often misunderstood.\r\n\r\n[12] Francke, _Die neueste Entwickelung der Textil-Industrie in\r\nDeutschland_.\r\n\r\n[13] _Cf._ Schulze Gäwernitz, _Der Grossbetrieb_, etc.--See\r\nAppendixes D, E, F.\r\n\r\n[14] The imports of German woollen stuffs into this country have\r\nsteadily grown from £607,444 in 1890 to £907,569 in 1894, and\r\n£1,822,514 in 1910. The British exports to Germany (of woollen stuffs\r\nand yarns) have also grown, but not in the same proportion. They were\r\nvalued at £2,769,392 in 1890, £3,017,163 in 1894, and £4,638,000 in\r\n1906-1910 (a five years’ average).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE DECENTRALISATION OF INDUSTRIES--(_continued_).\r\n\r\n  Italy and Spain--India--Japan--The United States--The cotton,\r\n  woollen, and silk trades--The growing necessity for each country\r\n  to rely chiefly upon home consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flow of industrial growths spreads, however, not only east; it\r\nmoves also south-east and south. Austria and Hungary are rapidly\r\ngaining ground in the race for industrial importance. The Triple\r\nAlliance has already been menaced by the growing tendency of Austrian\r\nmanufacturers to protect themselves against German competition; and\r\neven the dual monarchy has seen its two sister nations quarrelling\r\nabout customs duties. Austrian industries are a modern growth,\r\nand still they already give occupation to more than 4,000,000\r\nworkpeople.[15] Bohemia, in a few decades, has grown to be an\r\nindustrial country of considerable importance; and the excellence and\r\noriginality of the machinery used in the newly reformed flour-mills\r\nof Hungary show that the young industry of Hungary is on the right\r\nroad, not only to become a competitor to her elder sisters, but also\r\nto add her share to our knowledge as to the use of the forces of\r\nnature. Let me add, by the way, that the same is true to some extent\r\nwith regard to Finland. Figures are wanting as to the present state\r\nof the aggregate industries of Austria-Hungary; but the relatively\r\nlow imports of manufactured goods are worthy of note. For British\r\nmanufacturers Austria-Hungary is, in fact, no customer worth speaking\r\nof; but even with regard to Germany she is rapidly emancipating\r\nherself from her former dependence. (See Appendix G.)\r\n\r\nThe same industrial progress extends over the southern peninsulas.\r\nWho would have spoken in 1859 about Italian manufactures? And\r\nyet--the Turin Exhibition of 1884 has shown it--Italy ranks already\r\namong the manufacturing countries. “You see everywhere a considerable\r\nindustrial and commercial effort made,” wrote a French economist to\r\nthe _Temps_. “Italy aspires to go on without foreign produce. The\r\npatriotic watchword is, Italy all by herself. It inspires the whole\r\nmass of producers. There is not a single manufacturer or tradesman\r\nwho, even in the most trifling circumstances, does not do his best to\r\nemancipate himself from foreign guardianship.” The best French and\r\nEnglish patterns are imitated and improved by a touch of national\r\ngenius and artistic traditions. Complete statistics are wanting, so\r\nthat the statistical _Annuario_ resorts to indirect indications. But\r\nthe rapid increase of imports of coal (9,339,000 tons in 1910, as\r\nagainst 779,000 tons in 1871); the growth of the mining industries,\r\nwhich have trebled their production during the fifteen years, 1870 to\r\n1885; the increasing production of steel and machinery (£4,800,000\r\nin 1900), which--to use Bovio’s words--shows how a country having\r\nno fuel nor minerals of her own can have nevertheless a notable\r\nmetallurgical industry; and, finally, the growth of textile\r\nindustries disclosed by the net imports of raw cottons and the number\r\nof spindles[16]--all these show that the tendency towards becoming\r\na manufacturing country capable of satisfying her needs by her own\r\nmanufactures is not a mere dream. As to the efforts made for taking\r\na more lively part in the trade of the world, who does not know the\r\ntraditional capacities of the Italians in that direction?\r\n\r\nI ought also to mention Spain, whose textile mining and metallurgical\r\nindustries are rapidly growing; but I hasten to go over to countries\r\nwhich a few years ago were considered as eternal and obligatory\r\ncustomers to the manufacturing nations of Western Europe. Let us\r\ntake, for instance, Brazil. Was it not doomed by economists to grow\r\ncotton, to export it in a raw state, and to receive cotton goods in\r\nexchange? In 1870 its nine miserable cotton mills could boast only\r\nof an aggregate of 385 spindles. But already in 1887 there were in\r\nBrazil 46 cotton mills, and five of them had already 40,000 spindles;\r\nwhile altogether their nearly 10,000 looms threw every year on the\r\nBrazilian markets more than 33,000,000 yards of cotton stuffs.\r\n\r\nTwenty five years later, in 1912, there were already 161 cotton\r\nmills, with 1,500,000 spindles and 50,000 looms, employing over\r\n100,000 operatives.[17] Even Vera Cruz, in Mexico, under the\r\nprotection of customs officers, has begun to manufacture cottons, and\r\nboasted in 1887 its 40,200 spindles, 287,700 pieces of cotton cloth,\r\nand 212,000 lb. of yarn. Since that year progress has been steady,\r\nand in 1894 Vice-Consul Chapman reported that some of the finest\r\nmachines are to be found at the Orizaba spinning mills, while “cotton\r\nprints,” he wrote, “are now turned out as good if not superior to\r\nthe imported article.”[18] In 1910, 32,000 workpeople were already\r\nemployed in 145 cotton mills, which had 703,000 spindles, and 25,000\r\npower-looms.[19]\r\n\r\nThe flattest contradiction to the export theory has, however, been\r\ngiven by India. She was always considered as the surest customer for\r\nBritish cottons, and so she has been until quite lately. Out of the\r\ntotal of cotton goods exported from Britain she used to buy more than\r\none-quarter, very nearly one-third (from £17,000,000 to £22,000,000,\r\nout of an aggregate of about £75,000,000 in the years 1880-1890). But\r\nthings have begun to change, and in 1904-1907 the exports were only\r\nfrom £21,680,000 to £25,680,000 out of an aggregate of £110,440,000.\r\nThe Indian cotton manufactures, which--for some causes not fully\r\nexplained--were so unsuccessful at their beginnings, suddenly took\r\nfirm root.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 they consumed only 23,000,000 lb. of raw cotton, but the\r\nquantity was nearly four times as much in 1877, and it trebled again\r\nwithin the next ten years: 283,000,000 lb. of raw cotton were used in\r\n1887-1888. The number of cotton mills grew up from 40 in 1887 to 147\r\nin 1895; the number of spindles rose from 886,100 to 3,844,300 in the\r\nsame years; and where 57,188 workers were employed in 1887, we found,\r\nseven years later, 146,240 operatives. And now, in 1909-1910, we find\r\n237 cotton mills at work, with 6,136,000 spindles, 80,000 looms, and\r\n231,850 workpeople. As for the quality of the mills, the blue-books\r\npraise them; the German chambers of commerce state that the best\r\nspinning mills in Bombay “do not now stand far behind the best German\r\nones”; and two great authorities in the cotton industry, Mr. James\r\nPlatt and Mr. Henry Lee, agree in saying “that in no other country\r\nof the earth except in Lancashire do the operatives possess such a\r\nnatural leaning to the textile industry as in India.”[20]\r\n\r\nThe exports of cotton twist from India more than doubled in five\r\nyears (1882-1887), and already in 1887 we could read in the\r\n_Statement_ (p. 62) that “what cotton twist was imported was less\r\nand less of the coarser and even medium kind, which indicates that\r\nthe Indian (spinning) mills are gradually gaining hold of the home\r\nmarkets.” Consequently, while India continued to import nearly the\r\nsame amount of British cotton goods and yarn (from £16,000,000\r\nto £25,700,000 in 1900-1908), she threw already in 1887 on the\r\nforeign markets no less than £3,635,510 worth of her own cottons of\r\nLancashire patterns; she exported 33,000,000 yards of _gray cotton\r\npiece goods_ manufactured in India by Indian workmen. And the export\r\nhas continued to grow since, so that in the year 1910-1911 the value\r\nof the piece-goods and yarn exported from India reached the value of\r\n£7,943,700.\r\n\r\nThe jute factories in India have grown at a still speedier rate, and\r\nthe once flourishing jute trade of Dundee was brought to decay, not\r\nonly by the high tariffs of continental powers, but also by Indian\r\ncompetition.[21] Even woollen mills have lately been started; while\r\nthe iron industry took a sudden development in India, since the means\r\nwere found, after many experiments and failures, to work furnaces\r\nwith local coal. In a few years, we are told by specialists, India\r\nwill be self-supporting for iron. Nay, it is not without apprehension\r\nthat the English manufacturers see that the imports of Indian\r\nmanufactured textiles to this country are steadily growing, while\r\nin the markets of the Far East and Africa India becomes a serious\r\ncompetitor to the mother country.\r\n\r\nWhy should it not be so? What _might_ prevent the growth of Indian\r\nmanufactures? Is it the want of capital? But capital knows no\r\nfatherland; and if high profits can be derived from the work of\r\nIndian coolies whose wages are only one-half of those of English\r\nworkmen, or even less, capital will migrate to India, as it has gone\r\nto Russia, although its migration may mean starvation for Lancashire\r\nand Dundee. Is it the want of knowledge? But longitudes and latitudes\r\nare no obstacle to its spreading; it is only the first steps that are\r\ndifficult. As to the superiority of workmanship, nobody who knows the\r\nHindoo worker will doubt about his capacities. Surely they are not\r\nbelow those of the 36,000 children less than fourteen years of age,\r\nor the 238,000 boys and girls less than eighteen years old, who are\r\nemployed in the British textile manufactories.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwenty years surely are not much in the life of nations. And yet\r\nwithin the last twenty years another powerful competitor has grown\r\nin the East. I mean Japan. In October, 1888, the _Textile Recorder_\r\nmentioned in a few lines that the annual production of yarns in the\r\ncotton mills of Japan had attained 9,498,500 lb., and that fifteen\r\nmore mills, which would hold 156,100 spindles, were in course of\r\nerection.[22] Two years later, 27,000,000 lb. of yarn were spun in\r\nJapan; and while in 1887-1888 Japan imported five or six times as\r\nmuch yarn from abroad as was spun at home, next year two-thirds only\r\nof the total consumption of the country were imported from abroad.[23]\r\n\r\nFrom that date the production grew up regularly. From 6,435,000 lb.\r\nin 1886 it reached 91,950,000 lb. in 1893, and 153,444,000 lb. in\r\n1895. In nine years it had thus increased twenty-four times. Since\r\nthen it rose to 413,800,000 lb. in 1909; and we learn from the\r\n_Financial Economical Annual_ for the years 1910 and 1911, published\r\nat Tokio, that there were in Japan, in 1909, no less than 3,756\r\ntextile factories, with 1,785,700 spindles and 51,185 power-looms,\r\nto which 783,155 hand-looms must be added. Japan is thus already\r\na serious competitor of the great industrial nations for tissues\r\naltogether, and especially for cottons, in the markets of Eastern\r\nAsia; and it took it only five-and-twenty years to attain this\r\nposition. The total production of tissues, valued at £1,200,000 in\r\nthe year 1887, rapidly rose to £14,270,000 in 1895 and to £22,500,000\r\nin 1909--cottons entering into this amount to the extent of nearly\r\ntwo-fifths. Consequently, the imports of foreign cotton goods from\r\nEurope fell from £1,640,000 in 1884 to £849,600 in 1895, and to\r\n£411,600 in 1910, while the exports of silk goods rose to nearly\r\n£3,000,000.[24]\r\n\r\nAs to the coal and iron industries, I ventured in the first edition\r\nof this book to predict that the Japanese would not long remain a\r\ntributary to Europe for iron goods--that their ambition was also to\r\nhave their own shipbuilding yards, and that the previous year 300\r\nengineers left the Elswick works of Mr. Armstrong in order to start\r\nshipbuilding in Japan. They were engaged for five years only--the\r\nJapanese expecting to have learned enough in five years to be their\r\nown shipbuilders. This prediction has been entirely fulfilled.\r\nJapan has now 1,030 iron and machine works, and she now builds her\r\nown warships. During the last war, the progress realised in all\r\nindustries connected with war was rendered fully evident.[25]\r\n\r\nAll this shows that the much-dreaded invasion of the East upon\r\nEuropean markets is in rapid progress. The Chinese slumber still; but\r\nI am firmly persuaded from what I saw of China that the moment they\r\nwill begin to manufacture with the aid of European machinery--and\r\nthe first steps have already been made--they will do it with more\r\nsuccess, and necessarily on a far greater scale, than even the\r\nJapanese.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut what about the United States, which cannot be accused of\r\nemploying cheap labour or of sending to Europe “cheap and nasty”\r\nproduce? Their great industry is of yesterday’s date; and yet the\r\nStates already send to old Europe constantly increasing quantities of\r\nmachinery. In 1890 they began even to export iron, which they obtain\r\nat a very low cost, owing to admirable new methods which they have\r\nintroduced in metallurgy.\r\n\r\nIn the course of twenty years (1870-1890) the number of persons\r\nemployed in the American manufactures was more than doubled, and the\r\nvalue of their produce was nearly trebled; and in the course of the\r\nnext fifteen years, the number of persons employed increased again\r\nby nearly fifty per cent., while the value of the produce was nearly\r\ndoubled.[26] The cotton industry, supplied with excellent home-made\r\nmachinery, has been rapidly developing, so that the yearly production\r\nof textiles attained in 1905 a value of 2,147,441,400 dollars, thus\r\nbeing twice as large as the yearly production of the United Kingdom\r\nin the same branch (which was valued at about £200,000,000); and\r\nthe exports of cottons of domestic manufacture attained in 1910 the\r\nrespectable figure of £8,600,000.[27] As to the yearly output of\r\npig-iron and steel, it is already in excess of the yearly output in\r\nBritain;[28] and the organisation of that industry is also superior,\r\nas Mr. Berkley pointed out, already in 1891, in his address to the\r\nInstitute of Civil Engineers.[29]\r\n\r\nBut all this has grown almost entirely within the last thirty or\r\nforty years--whole industries having been created entirely since\r\n1860.[30] What will, then, American industry be twenty years, hence,\r\naided as it is by a wonderful development of technical skill, by\r\nexcellent schools, a scientific education which goes hand in hand\r\nwith technical education, and a spirit of enterprise which is\r\nunrivalled in Europe?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVolumes have been written about the crisis of 1886-1887, a crisis\r\nwhich, to use the words of the Parliamentary Commission, lasted since\r\n1875, with but “a short period of prosperity enjoyed by certain\r\nbranches of trade in the years 1880 to 1883,” and a crisis, I shall\r\nadd, which extended over all the chief manufacturing countries of the\r\nworld. All possible causes of the crisis have been examined; but,\r\nwhatever the cacophony of conclusions arrived at, all unanimously\r\nagreed upon one, namely, that of the Parliamentary Commission, which\r\ncould be summed up as follows: “The manufacturing countries do not\r\nfind such customers as would enable them to realise high profits.”\r\nProfits being the basis of capitalist industry, low profits explain\r\nall ulterior consequences.\r\n\r\nLow profits induce the employers to reduce the wages, or the number\r\nof workers, or the number of days of employment during the week, or\r\neventually compel them to resort to the manufacture of lower kinds\r\nof goods, which, as a rule, are paid worse than the higher sorts. As\r\nAdam Smith said, low profits ultimately mean a reduction of wages,\r\nand low wages mean a reduced consumption by the worker. Low profits\r\nmean also a somewhat reduced consumption by the employer; and both\r\ntogether mean lower profits and reduced consumption with that immense\r\nclass of middlemen which has grown up in manufacturing countries, and\r\nthat, again, means a further reduction of profits for the employers.\r\n\r\nA country which manufactures to a great extent for export, and\r\ntherefore lives to a considerable amount on the profits derived\r\nfrom her foreign trade, stands very much in the same position as\r\nSwitzerland, which lives to a great extent on the profits derived\r\nfrom the foreigners who visit her lakes and glaciers. A good “season”\r\nmeans an influx of from £1,000,000 to £2,000,000 of money imported by\r\nthe tourists, and a bad “season” has the effects of a bad crop in an\r\nagricultural country: a general impoverishment follows. So it is also\r\nwith a country which manufactures for export. If the “season” is bad,\r\nand the exported goods cannot be sold abroad for twice their value at\r\nhome, the country which lives chiefly on these bargains suffers. Low\r\nprofits for the innkeepers of the Alps mean narrowed circumstances\r\nin large parts of Switzerland; and low profits for the Lancashire\r\nand Scotch manufacturers, and the wholesale exporters, mean narrowed\r\ncircumstances in Great Britain. The cause is the same in both cases.\r\n\r\nFor many decades past we had not seen such a cheapness of wheat\r\nand manufactured goods as we saw in 1883-1884, and yet in 1886 the\r\ncountry was suffering from a terrible crisis. People said, of course,\r\nthat the cause of the crisis was over-production. But over-production\r\nis a word utterly devoid of sense if it does not mean that those who\r\nare in need of all kinds of produce have not the means for buying\r\nthem with their low wages. Nobody would dare to affirm that there is\r\ntoo much furniture in the crippled cottages, too many bedsteads and\r\nbedclothes in the workmen’s dwellings, too many lamps burning in the\r\nhuts, and too much cloth on the shoulders, not only of those who used\r\nto sleep (in 1886) in Trafalgar Square between two newspapers, but\r\neven in those households where a silk hat makes a part of the Sunday\r\ndress. And nobody will dare to affirm that there is too much food in\r\nthe homes of those agricultural labourers who earn twelve shillings\r\na week, or of those women who earn from fivepence to sixpence a day\r\nin the clothing trade and other small industries which swarm in the\r\noutskirts of all great cities. Over-production means merely and\r\nsimply a want of purchasing powers amidst the workers. And the same\r\nwant of purchasing powers of the workers was felt everywhere on the\r\nContinent during the years 1885-1887.\r\n\r\nAfter the bad years were over, a sudden revival of international\r\ntrade took place; and, as the British exports rose in four years\r\n(1886 to 1890) by nearly 24 per cent., it began to be said that\r\nthere was no reason for being alarmed by foreign competition; that\r\nthe decline of exports in 1885-1887 was only temporary, and general\r\nin Europe; and that England, now as of old, fully maintained her\r\ndominant position in the international trade. It is certainly true\r\nthat if we consider exclusively the money value of the exports for\r\nthe years 1876 to 1895, we see no permanent decline, we notice only\r\nfluctuations. British exports, like commerce altogether, seem to\r\nshow a certain periodicity. They fell from £201,000,000 sterling in\r\n1876 to £192,000,000 in 1879; then they rose again to £241,000,000\r\nin 1882, and fell down to £213,000,000 in 1886; again they rose\r\nto £264,000,000 in 1890, but fell again, reaching a minimum of\r\n£216,000,000 in 1894, to be followed next year by a slight movement\r\nupwards.\r\n\r\nThis periodicity being a fact, Mr. Giffen could make light in 1886 of\r\n“German competition” by showing that exports from the United Kingdom\r\nhad not decreased. It can even be said that, per head of population,\r\nthey had remained unchanged until 1904, undergoing only the usual ups\r\nand downs.[31] However, when we come to consider the _quantities_\r\nexported, and compare them with the _money values_ of the exports,\r\neven Mr. Giffen had to acknowledge that the prices of 1883 were\r\nso low in comparison with those of 1873 that in order to reach the\r\nsame money value the United Kingdom would have had to export four\r\npieces of cotton instead of three, and eight or ten tons of metallic\r\ngoods instead of six. “The aggregate of British foreign trade, if\r\nvalued at the prices of ten years previously, would have amounted to\r\n£861,000,000 instead of £667,000,000,” we were told by no less an\r\nauthority than the Commission on Trade Depression.\r\n\r\nIt might, however, be said that 1873 was an exceptional year, owing\r\nto the inflated demand which took place after the Franco-German war.\r\nBut the same downward movement continued for a number of years. Thus,\r\nif we take the figures given in the _Statesman’s Year-book_, we see\r\nthat while the United Kingdom exported, in 1883, 4,957,000,000 yards\r\nof piece goods (cotton, woollen and linen) and 316,000,000 lb. of\r\nyarn in order to reach an export value of £104,000,000, the same\r\ncountry had to export, in 1895, no less than 5,478,000,000 yards\r\nof the same stuffs and 330,000,000 lb. of yarn in order to realise\r\n£99,700,000 only. And the figures would have appeared still more\r\nunfavourable if we took the cottons alone. True, the conditions\r\nimproved during the last ten years, so that in 1906 the exports were\r\nsimilar to those of 1873; and they were better still in 1911, which\r\nwas a year of an extraordinary foreign trade, when 7,041,000,000\r\nyards of stuffs and 307,000,000 lb. of yarn were exported--the two\r\nbeing valued at £163,400,000. However, it was especially the yarn\r\nwhich kept the high prices, because it is the finest sorts of yarn\r\nwhich are now exported. But the great profits of the years 1873-1880\r\nare irretrievably gone.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that while the total value of the exports from the United\r\nKingdom, in proportion to its growing population, remains, broadly\r\nspeaking, unaltered for the last thirty years, the high prices which\r\ncould be got for the exports thirty years ago, and with them the\r\nhigh profits, are gone. And no amount of arithmetical calculations\r\nwill persuade the British manufacturers that such is not the case.\r\nThey know perfectly well that the home markets grow continually\r\noverstocked; that the best foreign markets are escaping; and that\r\nin the neutral markets Britain is being undersold. This is the\r\nunavoidable consequence of the development of manufactures all over\r\nthe world. (See Appendix J.)\r\n\r\nGreat hopes were laid, some time ago, in Australia as a market for\r\nBritish goods; but Australia will soon do what Canada already does.\r\nShe will manufacture. And the colonial exhibitions, by showing to\r\nthe “colonists” what they are able to do, and how they must do, are\r\nonly accelerating the day when each colony _farà da sè_ in her turn.\r\nCanada and India already impose protective duties on British goods.\r\nAs to the much-spoken-of markets on the Congo, and Mr. Stanley’s\r\ncalculations and promises of a trade amounting to £26,000,000 a\r\nyear if the Lancashire people supply the Africans with loin-cloths,\r\nsuch promises belong to the same category of fancies as the famous\r\nnightcaps of the Chinese which were to enrich England after the first\r\nChinese war. The Chinese prefer their own home-made nightcaps; and as\r\nto the Congo people, four countries at least are already competing\r\nfor supplying them with their poor dress: Britain, Germany, the\r\nUnited States, and, last but not least, India.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when this country had almost the monopoly in the\r\ncotton industries; but already in 1880 she possessed only 55 per\r\ncent. of all the spindles at work in Europe, the United States and\r\nIndia (40,000,000 out of 72,000,000), and a little more than one-half\r\nof the looms (550,000 out of 972,000). In 1893 the proportion was\r\nfurther reduced to 49 per cent. of the spindles (45,300,000 out of\r\n91,340,000), and now the United Kingdom has only 41 per cent. of\r\nall the spindles.[32] It was thus losing ground while the others\r\nwere winning. And the fact is quite natural: it might have been\r\nforeseen. There is no reason why Britain should always be the great\r\ncotton manufactory of the world, when raw cotton has to be imported\r\ninto this country as elsewhere. It was quite natural that France,\r\nGermany, Italy, Russia, India, Japan, the United States, and even\r\nMexico and Brazil, should begin to spin their own yarns and to weave\r\ntheir own cotton stuffs. But the appearance of the cotton industry in\r\na country, or, in fact, of any textile industry, unavoidably becomes\r\nthe starting-point for the growth of a series of other industries;\r\nchemical and mechanical works, metallurgy and mining feel at once\r\nthe impetus given by a new want. The whole of the home industries,\r\nas also technical education altogether, _must_ improve in order to\r\nsatisfy that want as soon as it has been felt.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened with regard to cottons is going on also with regard\r\nto other industries. Great Britain, which stood in 1880 at the head\r\nof the list of countries producing pig-iron, came in 1904 the third\r\nin the same list, which was headed by the United States and Germany;\r\nwhile Russia, which occupied the seventh place in 1880, comes now\r\nfourth, after Great Britain.[33] Britain and Belgium have no longer\r\nthe monopoly of the woollen trade. Immense factories at Verviers\r\nare silent; the Belgian weavers are misery-stricken, while Germany\r\nyearly increases her production of woollens, and exports nine times\r\nmore woollens than Belgium. Austria has her own woollens and exports\r\nthem; Riga, Lodz, and Moscow supply Russia with fine woollen cloths;\r\nand the growth of the woollen industry in each of the last-named\r\ncountries calls into existence hundreds of connected trades.\r\n\r\nFor many years France has had the monopoly of the silk trade.\r\nSilkworms being reared in Southern France, it was quite natural\r\nthat Lyons should grow into a centre for the manufacture of silks.\r\nSpinning, domestic weaving, and dyeing works developed to a great\r\nextent. But eventually the industry took such an extension that home\r\nsupplies of raw silk became insufficient, and raw silk was imported\r\nfrom Italy, Spain and Southern Austria, Asia Minor, the Caucasus and\r\nJapan, to the amount of from £9,000,000 to £11,000,000 in 1875 and\r\n1876, while France had only £800,000 worth of her own silk. Thousands\r\nof peasant boys and girls were attracted by high wages to Lyons and\r\nthe neighbouring district; the industry was prosperous.\r\n\r\nHowever, by-and-by new centres of silk trade grew up at Basel and in\r\nthe peasant houses round Zürich. French emigrants imported the trade\r\ninto Switzerland, and it developed there, especially after the civil\r\nwar of 1871. Then the Caucasus Administration invited French workmen\r\nand women from Lyons and Marseilles to teach the Georgians and the\r\nRussians the best means of rearing the silkworm, as well as the\r\nwhole of the silk trade; and Stavropol became a new centre for silk\r\nweaving. Austria and the United States did the same; and what are now\r\nthe results?\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1872 to 1881 Switzerland more than doubled the\r\nproduce of her silk industry; Italy and Germany increased it by\r\none-third; and the Lyons region, which formerly manufactured to the\r\nvalue of 454 million francs a year, showed in 1887 a return of only\r\n378 millions. The exports of Lyons silks, which reached an average\r\nof 425,000,000 francs in 1855-1859, and 460,000,000 in 1870-1874,\r\nfell down to 233,000,000 in 1887. And it is reckoned by French\r\nspecialists that at present no less than one-third of the silk stuffs\r\nused in France are imported from Zurich, Crefeld, and Barmen. Nay,\r\neven Italy, which has now 191,000 persons engaged in the industry,\r\nsends her silks to France and competes with Lyons.\r\n\r\nThe French manufacturers may cry as loudly as they like for\r\nprotection, or resort to the production of cheaper goods of lower\r\nquality; they may sell 3,250,000 kilogrammes of silk stuffs at the\r\nsame price as they sold 2,500,000 in 1855-1859--they will never\r\nagain regain the position they occupied before. Italy, Switzerland,\r\nGermany, the United States and Russia have their own silk factories,\r\nand will import from Lyons only the highest qualities of stuffs. As\r\nto the lower sorts, a foulard has become a common attire with the St.\r\nPetersburg housemaids, because the North Caucasian domestic trades\r\nsupply them at a price which would starve the Lyons weavers. The\r\ntrade has been decentralised, and while Lyons is still a centre for\r\nthe higher artistic silks, it will never be again the chief centre\r\nfor the silk trade which it was thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nLike examples could be produced by the score. Greenock no longer\r\nsupplies Russia with sugar, because Russia has plenty of her own\r\nat the same price as it sells at in England. The watch trade is no\r\nmore a speciality of Switzerland: watches are now made everywhere.\r\nIndia extracts from her ninety collieries two-thirds of her annual\r\nconsumption of coal. The chemical trade which grew up on the banks of\r\nthe Clyde and Tyne, owing to the special advantages offered for the\r\nimport of Spanish pyrites and the agglomeration of such a variety of\r\nindustries along the two estuaries, is now in decay. Spain, with the\r\nhelp of English capital, is beginning to utilise her own pyrites for\r\nherself; and Germany has become a great centre for the manufacture\r\nof sulphuric acid and soda--nay, she already complains about\r\nover-production.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut enough! I have before me so many figures, all telling the\r\nsame tale, that examples could be multiplied at will. It is time\r\nto conclude, and, for every unprejudiced mind, the conclusion is\r\nself-evident. Industries of all kinds decentralise and are scattered\r\nall over the globe; and everywhere a variety, an integrated variety,\r\nof trades grows, instead of specialisation. Such are the prominent\r\nfeatures of the times we live in. Each nation becomes in its turn a\r\nmanufacturing nation; and the time is not far off when each nation\r\nof Europe, as well as the United States, and even the most backward\r\nnations of Asia and America, will themselves manufacture nearly\r\neverything they are in need of. Wars and several accidental causes\r\nmay check for some time the scattering of industries: they will not\r\nstop it; it is unavoidable. For each new-comer the first steps only\r\nare difficult. But, as soon as any industry has taken firm root,\r\nit calls into existence hundreds of other trades; and as soon as\r\nthe first steps have been made, and the first obstacles have been\r\novercome, the industrial growth goes on at an accelerated rate.\r\n\r\nThe fact is so well felt, if not understood, that the race for\r\ncolonies has become the distinctive feature of the last twenty years.\r\nEach nation will have her own colonies. But colonies will not help.\r\nThere is not a second India in the world, and the old conditions\r\nwill be repeated no more. Nay, some of the British colonies already\r\nthreaten to become serious competitors with their mother country;\r\nothers, like Australia, will not fail to follow the same lines. As\r\nto the yet neutral markets, China will never be a serious customer\r\nto Europe: she can produce much cheaper at home; and when she begins\r\nto feel a need for goods of European patterns, she will produce them\r\nherself. Woe to Europe, if on the day that the steam engine invades\r\nChina she is still relying on foreign customers! As to the African\r\nhalf-savages, their misery is no foundation for the well-being of a\r\ncivilised nation.\r\n\r\nProgress must be looked for in another direction. _It is in producing\r\nfor home use._ The customers for the Lancashire cottons and the\r\nSheffield cutlery, the Lyons silks and the Hungarian flour-mills,\r\nare not in India, nor in Africa. The true consumers of the produce\r\nof our factories must be our own populations. And they _can_ be\r\nthat, once we organise our economical life so that they might issue\r\nfrom their present destitution. No use to send floating shops to\r\nNew Guinea with British or German millinery, when there are plenty\r\nof would-be customers for British millinery in these very islands,\r\nand for German goods in Germany. Instead of worrying our brains by\r\nschemes for getting customers abroad, it would be better to try\r\nto answer the following questions: Why the British worker, whose\r\nindustrial capacities are so highly praised in political speeches;\r\nwhy the Scotch crofter and the Irish peasant, whose obstinate labours\r\nin creating new productive soil out of peat bogs are occasionally\r\nso much spoken of, are no customers to the Lancashire weavers, the\r\nSheffield cutlers and the Northumbrian and Welsh pitmen? Why the\r\nLyons weavers not only do not wear silks, but sometimes have no food\r\nin their attics? Why the Russian peasants sell their corn, and for\r\nfour, six, and sometimes eight months every year are compelled to mix\r\nbark and auroch grass to a handful of flour for baking their bread?\r\nWhy famines are so common amidst the growers of wheat and rice in\r\nIndia?\r\n\r\nUnder the present conditions of division into capitalists and\r\nlabourers, into property-holders and masses living on uncertain\r\nwages, the spreading of industries over new fields is accompanied\r\nby the very same horrible facts of pitiless oppression, massacre of\r\nchildren, pauperism, and insecurity of life. The Russian Fabrics\r\nInspectors’ Reports, the Reports of the Plauen Handelskammer, the\r\nItalian inquests, and the reports about the growing industries of\r\nIndia and Japan are full of the same revelations as the Reports\r\nof the Parliamentary Commissions of 1840 to 1842, or the modern\r\nrevelations with regard to the “sweating system” at Whitechapel\r\nand Glasgow, London pauperism, and York unemployment. The Capital\r\nand Labour problem is thus universalised; but, at the same time,\r\nit is also simplified. To return to a state of affairs where corn\r\nis grown, and manufactured goods are fabricated, _for the use of\r\nthose very people who grow and produce them_--such will be, no\r\ndoubt, the problem to be solved during the next coming years of\r\nEuropean history. Each region will become its own producer and its\r\nown consumer of manufactured goods. But that unavoidably implies\r\nthat, at the same time, it will be its own producer and consumer\r\nof agricultural produce; and that is precisely what I am going to\r\ndiscuss next.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] During the census of 1902, there were in Austria 1,408,000\r\nindustrial establishments, with 1,787,000 horse-power, giving\r\noccupation to 4,049,300 workpeople; 1,128,000 workpeople were engaged\r\nin manufactures in Hungary.\r\n\r\n[16] The net imports of raw cotton reached 1,180,000 cwts. in 1885,\r\nand 4,120,000 cwts. in 1908; the number of spindles grew from\r\n880,000 in 1877 to 3,800,000 in 1907. The whole industry has grown\r\nup since 1859. In 1910 no less than 358,200 tons of pig-iron and\r\n671,000 tons of steel were produced in Italy. The exports of textiles\r\nreached the following values in 1905-1910: Silks, from £17,800,000\r\nto £24,794,000; cottons, £4,430,000 to £5,040,000; woollens, from\r\n£440,000 to £1,429,000.\r\n\r\n[17] _Times_, August 27, 1912.\r\n\r\n[18] _The Economist_, 12th May, 1894, p. 9: “A few years ago the\r\nOrizaba mills used entirely imported raw cotton; but now they use\r\nhome-grown and home-spun cotton as much as possible.”\r\n\r\n[19] _Annuario Estadistico_, 1911. They consumed 34,700 tons of raw\r\ncotton, and produced 13,936,300 pieces of cotton goods, and 554,000\r\ncwts. of yarn.\r\n\r\n[20] Schulze Gäwernitz, _The Cotton Trade_, etc., p. 123.\r\n\r\n[21] In 1882 they had 5,633 looms and 95,937 spindles. Thirteen\r\nyears later these figures were already doubled--there being 10,600\r\nlooms and 216,000 spindles. Now, or rather in 1909-1910, we find\r\n60 jute mills, with 31,420 looms, 645,700 spindles, and 204,000\r\nworkpeople. The progress realised in the machinery is best seen from\r\nthese figures. The exports of jute stuffs from India, which were\r\nonly £1,543,870 in 1884-1885, reached £11,333,000 in 1910-1911. (See\r\nAppendix H.)\r\n\r\n[22] _Textile Recorder_, 15th October, 1888.\r\n\r\n[23] 39,200,000 lb. of yarn were imported in 1886 as against\r\n6,435,000 lb. of home-spun yarn. In 1889 the figures were: 56,633,000\r\nlb. imported and 26,809,000 lb. home-spun.\r\n\r\n[24] In 1910 the imports of cotton and woollens were only £2,650,500,\r\nwhile the exports of cotton yarn, cotton shirtings, and silk\r\nmanufactures reached a value of £8,164,800.\r\n\r\n[25] The mining industry has grown as follows:--Copper extracted:\r\n2,407 tons in 1875; 49,000 in 1909.

The total value of products of the steel works and rolling\r\nmills reached in 1909 the immense value of £197,144,500.

It has shown the growth of\r\nquite new conditions, and new conditions require new adaptations. To\r\nendeavour to revive the past would be useless: a new departure must\r\nbe taken by civilised nations.\r\n\r\nOf course, there will be plenty of voices to argue that the former\r\nsupremacy of the pioneers must be maintained at any price: all\r\npioneers are in the habit of saying so. It will be suggested that the\r\npioneers must attain such a superiority of technical knowledge and\r\norganisation as to enable them to beat all their younger competitors;\r\nthat force must be resorted to if necessary. But force is reciprocal;\r\nand if the god of war always sides with the strongest battalions,\r\nthose battalions are strongest which fight for new rights against\r\noutgrown privileges. As to the honest longing for more technical\r\neducation--surely let us all have as much of it as possible: it\r\nwill be a boon for humanity; for humanity, of course--not for a\r\nsingle nation, because knowledge cannot be cultivated for home use\r\nonly. Knowledge and invention, boldness of thought and enterprise,\r\nconquests of genius and improvements of social organisation have\r\nbecome international growths; and no kind of progress--intellectual,\r\nindustrial or social--can be kept within political boundaries;\r\nit crosses the seas, it pierces the mountains; steppes are no\r\nobstacle to it. Knowledge and inventive powers are now so thoroughly\r\ninternational that if a simple newspaper paragraph announces\r\nto-morrow that the problem of storing force, of printing without\r\ninking, or of aerial navigation, has received a practical solution in\r\none country of the world, we may feel sure that within a few weeks\r\nthe same problem will be solved, almost in the same way, by several\r\ninventors of different nationalities.[34] Continually we learn that\r\nthe same scientific discovery, or technical invention, has been made\r\nwithin a few days’ distance, in countries a thousand miles apart; as\r\nif there were a kind of atmosphere which favours the germination of a\r\ngiven idea at a given moment. And such an atmosphere exists: steam,\r\nprint and the common stock of knowledge have created it.\r\n\r\nThose who dream of monopolising technical genius are therefore\r\nfifty years behind the times. The world--the wide, wide world--is\r\nnow the true domain of knowledge; and if each nation displays some\r\nspecial capacities in some special branch, the various capacities of\r\ndifferent nations compensate one another, and the advantages which\r\ncould be derived from them would be only temporary. The fine British\r\nworkmanship in mechanical arts, the American boldness for gigantic\r\nenterprise, the French systematic mind, and the German pedagogy, are\r\nbecoming international capacities. Sir William Armstrong, in his\r\nworks established in Italy and Japan, has already communicated to\r\nItalians and Japanese those capacities for managing huge iron masses\r\nwhich have been nurtured on the Tyne; the uproarious American spirit\r\nof enterprise pervades the Old World; the French taste for harmony\r\nbecomes European taste; and German pedagogy--improved, I dare say--is\r\nat home in Russia. So, instead of trying to keep life in the old\r\nchannels, it would be better to see what the new conditions are, what\r\nduties they impose on our generation.\r\n\r\nThe characters of the new conditions are plain, and their\r\nconsequences are easy to understand. As the manufacturing nations of\r\nWest Europe are meeting with steadily growing difficulties in selling\r\ntheir manufactured goods abroad, and getting food in exchange, they\r\nwill be compelled to grow their food at home; they will be bound to\r\nrely on home customers for their manufactures, and on home producers\r\nfor their food. And the sooner they do so the better.\r\n\r\nTwo great objections stand, however, in the way against the general\r\nacceptance of such conclusions. We have been taught, both by\r\neconomists and politicians, that the territories of the West European\r\nStates are so overcrowded with inhabitants that they cannot grow all\r\nthe food and raw produce which are necessary for the maintenance of\r\ntheir steadily increasing populations. Therefore the necessity of\r\nexporting manufactured goods and of importing food. And we are told,\r\nmoreover, that even if it were possible to grow in Western Europe all\r\nthe food necessary for its inhabitants, there would be no advantage\r\nin doing so as long as the same food can be got cheaper from abroad.\r\nSuch are the present teachings and the ideas which are current in\r\nsociety at large. And yet it is easy to prove that both are totally\r\nerroneous: plenty of food could be grown on the territories of\r\nWestern Europe for much more than their present populations, and an\r\nimmense benefit would be derived from doing so. These are the two\r\npoints which I have now to discuss.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo begin by taking the most disadvantageous case: is it possible that\r\nthe soil of Great Britain, which at present yields food for one-third\r\nonly of its inhabitants, could provide all the necessary amount and\r\nvariety of food for 41,000,000 human beings when it covers only\r\n56,000,000 acres all told--forests and rocks, marshes and peat-bogs,\r\ncities, railways and fields--out of which only 33,000,000 acres are\r\nconsidered as cultivable?[35] The current opinion is, that it by no\r\nmeans can; and that opinion is so inveterate that we even see men\r\nof science, who are generally cautious when dealing with current\r\nopinions, endorse that opinion without even taking the trouble of\r\nverifying it. It is accepted as an axiom. And yet, as soon as we try\r\nto find out any argument in its favour, we discover that it has not\r\nthe slightest foundation, either in facts or in judgment based upon\r\nwell-known facts.\r\n\r\nLet us take, for instance, J. B. Lawes’ estimates of crops which were\r\npublished every year in _The Times_. In his estimate of the year 1887\r\nhe made the remark that during the eight harvest years 1853-1860\r\n“nearly three-fourths of the aggregate amount of wheat consumed\r\nin the United Kingdom was of home growth, and little more than\r\none-fourth was derived from foreign sources”; but five-and-twenty\r\nyears later the figures were almost reversed--that is, “during the\r\neight years 1879-1886, little more than one-third has been provided\r\nby home crops and nearly two-thirds by imports.” But neither the\r\nincrease of population by 8,000,000 nor the increase of consumption\r\nof wheat by six-tenths of a bushel per head could account for the\r\nchange. In the years 1853-1860 the soil of Britain nourished one\r\ninhabitant on every two acres cultivated: why did it require three\r\nacres in order to nourish the same inhabitant in 1887? The answer is\r\nplain: merely and simply because agriculture had fallen into neglect.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the area under wheat had been reduced since 1853-1860 by\r\nfull 1,590,000 acres, and therefore the average crop of the years\r\n1883-1886 was below the average crop of 1853-1860 by more than\r\n40,000,000 bushels; and this deficit alone represented the food of\r\nmore than 7,000,000 inhabitants. At the same time the area under\r\nbarley, oats, beans, and other spring crops had also been reduced by\r\na further 560,000 acres, which, alone, at the low average of thirty\r\nbushels per acre, would have represented the cereals necessary to\r\ncomplete the above, for the same 7,000,000 inhabitants. It can thus\r\nbe said that if the United Kingdom imported cereals for 17,000,000\r\ninhabitants in 1887, instead of for 10,000,000 in 1860, it was simply\r\nbecause more than 2,000,000 acres had gone out of cultivation.[36]\r\n\r\nThese facts are well known; but usually they are met with the remark\r\nthat the character of agriculture had been altered: that instead of\r\ngrowing wheat, meat and milk were produced in this country. However,\r\nthe figures for 1887, compared with the figures for 1860, show that\r\nthe same downward movement took place under the heads of green crops\r\nand the like. The area under potatoes was reduced by 280,000 acres;\r\nunder turnips by 180,000 acres; and although there was an increase\r\nunder the heads of mangold, carrots, etc., still the aggregate area\r\nunder all these crops was reduced by a further 330,000 acres. An\r\nincrease of area was found only for permanent pasture (2,800,000\r\nacres) and grass under rotation (1,600,000 acres); but we should look\r\nin vain for a corresponding increase of live stock. The increase of\r\nlive stock which took place during those twenty-seven years was not\r\nsufficient to cover even the area reclaimed from waste land.[37]\r\n\r\nSince the year 1887 affairs went, however, from worse to worse. If\r\nwe take Great Britain alone, we see that in 1885 the area under\r\nall corn crops was 8,392,006 acres; that is very small, indeed, in\r\ncomparison to the area which could have been cultivated; but even\r\nthat little was further reduced to 7,400,227 acres in 1895. The\r\narea under wheat was 2,478,318 acres in 1885 (as against 3,630,300\r\nin 1874); but it dwindled away to 1,417,641 acres in 1895, while\r\nthe area under the other cereals increased by a trifle only--from\r\n5,198,026 acres to 5,462,184--the total loss on all cereals being\r\nnearly 1,000,000 _acres in ten years_! Another 5,000,000 people were\r\nthus compelled to get their food from abroad.\r\n\r\nDid the area under green crops increase correspondingly, as it would\r\nhave done if it were only the character of agriculture that had\r\nchanged? Not in the least! This area was further reduced by nearly\r\n500,000 acres (3,521,602 in 1885, 3,225,762 in 1895, and 3,006,000\r\nin 1909-1911). Or was the area under clover and grasses in rotation\r\nincreased in proportion to all these reductions? Alas no! It also was\r\nreduced (4,654,173 acres in 1885, 4,729,801 in 1895, and 4,164,000\r\nacres in 1909-1911). In short, taking all the land that is under\r\ncrops in rotation (17,201,490 acres in 1885, 16,166,950 acres in\r\n1895, 14,795,570 only in 1905, and 14,682,550 in 1909-1911), we see\r\nthat within the last twenty-six years another 2,500,000 acres went\r\nout of cultivation, without any compensation whatever. It went to\r\nincrease that already enormous area of more than 17,000,000 acres\r\n(17,460,000 in 1909-1911)--_more than one-half of the cultivable\r\narea_--which goes under the head of “permanent pasture,” and hardly\r\nsuffices to feed one cow on each three acres!\r\n\r\nNeed I say, after that, that quite to the contrary of what we are\r\ntold about the British agriculturists becoming “meat-makers” instead\r\nof “wheat-growers,” no corresponding increase of live stock took\r\nplace during the last twenty-five years. Far from devoting the land\r\nfreed from cereals to “meat-making,” the country further reduced its\r\nlive stock in 1885-1895, and began to show a slight increase during\r\nthe last few years only. It had 6,597,964 head of horned cattle in\r\n1885, 6,354,336 in 1895, and 7,057,520 in 1909-1911; 26,534,600 sheep\r\nin 1885, 25,792,200 in 1895, and from 26,500,000 to 27,610,000 in\r\n1909-1911. True, the number of horses increased; every butcher and\r\ngreengrocer runs now a horse “to take orders at the gents’ doors” (in\r\nSweden and Switzerland, by the way, they do it by telephone). But\r\nif we take the numbers of horses used in agriculture, unbroken, and\r\nkept for breeding, we find only small oscillations between 1,408,790\r\nin 1885 and 1,553,000 in 1909. But numbers of horses are imported, as\r\nalso the oats and a considerable amount of the hay that is required\r\nfor feeding them.[38] And if the consumption of meat has really\r\nincreased in this country, it is due to cheap imported meat, not to\r\nthe meat that would be produced in these islands.[39]\r\n\r\nIn short, agriculture has not changed its direction, as we are\r\noften told; it simply went down in all directions. Land is going\r\nout of culture at a perilous rate, while the latest improvements\r\nin market-gardening, fruit-growing and poultry-keeping are but a\r\nmere trifle if we compare them with what has been done in the same\r\ndirection in France, Belgium and America.\r\n\r\nIt must be said that during the last few years there was a slight\r\nimprovement. The area under all corn crops was slightly increasing,\r\nand it fluctuated about 7,000,000 acres, the increase being\r\nespecially notable for wheat (1,906,000 acres in 1911 as against\r\n1,625,450 in 1907), while the areas under barley and oats were\r\nslightly diminished. But with all that, the surface under corn\r\ncrops is still nearly _one-and-a-half million acres_ below what it\r\nwas in 1885, and nearly _two-and-a-half million acres_ below 1874.\r\nThis represents, let us remember it, the bread-food of _ten million\r\npeople_.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this general downward movement is self-evident. It is\r\nthe desertion, the abandonment of the land. Each crop requiring\r\nhuman labour has had its area reduced; and almost one-half of the\r\nagricultural labourers have been sent away since 1861 to reinforce\r\nthe ranks of the unemployed in the cities,[40] so that far from being\r\nover-populated, the fields of Britain are _starved of human labour_,\r\nas James Caird used to say. The British nation does not work on her\r\nsoil; _she is prevented from doing so_; and the would-be economists\r\ncomplain that the soil will not nourish its inhabitants!\r\n\r\nI once took a knapsack and went on foot out of London, through\r\nSussex. I had read Léonce de Lavergne’s work and expected to find\r\na soil busily cultivated; but neither round London nor still less\r\nfurther south did I see men in the fields. In the Weald I could walk\r\nfor twenty miles without crossing anything but heath or woodlands,\r\nrented as pheasant-shooting grounds to “London gentlemen,” as the\r\nlabourers said. “Ungrateful soil” was my first thought; but then I\r\nwould occasionally come to a farm at the crossing of two roads and\r\nsee the same soil bearing a rich crop; and my next thought was _tel\r\nseigneur, telle terre_, as the French peasants say. Later on I saw\r\nthe rich fields of the midland counties; but even there I was struck\r\nby not perceiving the same busy human labour which I was accustomed\r\nto admire on the Belgian and French fields. But I ceased to wonder\r\nwhen I learnt that only 1,383,000 men and women in England and\r\nWales work in the fields, while more than 16,000,000 belong to the\r\n“professional, domestic, indefinite, and unproductive class,” as\r\nthese pitiless statisticians say. One million human beings cannot\r\nproductively cultivate an area of 33,000,000 acres, unless they can\r\nresort to the Bonanza farm’s methods of culture.\r\n\r\nAgain, taking Harrow as the centre of my excursions, I could walk\r\nfive miles towards London, or turning my back upon it, and I could\r\nsee nothing east or west but meadow land on which they hardly cropped\r\ntwo tons of hay per acre--scarcely enough to keep alive one milch\r\ncow on each two acres. Man is conspicuous by his absence from those\r\nmeadows; he rolls them with a heavy roller in the spring; he spreads\r\nsome manure every two or three years; then he disappears until the\r\ntime has come to make hay. And that--within ten miles from Charing\r\nCross, close to a city with 5,000,000 inhabitants, supplied with\r\nFlemish and Jersey potatoes, French salads and Canadian apples. In\r\nthe hands of the Paris gardeners, each thousand acres situated within\r\nthe same distance from the city would be cultivated by at least 2,000\r\nhuman beings, who would get vegetables to the value of from £50 to\r\n£300 per acre. But here the acres which only need human hands to\r\nbecome an inexhaustible source of golden crops lie idle, and they say\r\nto us, “Heavy clay!” without even knowing that in the hands of man\r\nthere are no unfertile soils; that the most fertile soils are not in\r\nthe prairies of America, nor in the Russian steppes; that they are in\r\nthe peat-bogs of Ireland, on the sand downs of the northern sea-coast\r\nof France, on the craggy mountains of the Rhine, where they have been\r\nmade by man’s hands.\r\n\r\nThe most striking fact is, however, that in some undoubtedly fertile\r\nparts of the country things are even in a worse condition. My heart\r\nsimply ached when I saw the state in which land is kept in South\r\nDevon, and when I learned to know what “permanent pasture” means.\r\nField after field is covered with nothing but grass, three inches\r\nhigh, and thistles in profusion. Twenty, thirty such fields can\r\nbe seen at one glance from the top of every hill; and thousands\r\nof acres are in that state, notwithstanding that the grandfathers\r\nof the present generation have devoted a formidable amount of\r\nlabour to the clearing of that land from the stones, to fencing it,\r\nroughly draining it and the like. In every direction I could see\r\nabandoned cottages and orchards going to ruin. A whole population\r\nhas disappeared, and even its last vestiges must disappear if things\r\ncontinue to go on as they have gone. And this takes place in a part\r\nof the country endowed with a most fertile soil and possessed of a\r\nclimate which is certainly more congenial than the climate of Jersey\r\nin spring and early summer--a land upon which even the poorest\r\ncottagers occasionally raise potatoes as early as the first half of\r\nMay. But how can that land be cultivated when there is nobody to\r\ncultivate it? “We have fields; men go by, but never go in,” an old\r\nlabourer said to me; and so it is in reality.[41]\r\n\r\nSuch were my impressions of British agriculture twenty years ago.\r\nUnfortunately, both the official statistical data and the mass\r\nof private evidence published since tend to show that but little\r\nimprovement took place in the general conditions of agriculture in\r\nthis country within the last twenty years. Some successful attempts\r\nin various new directions have been made in different parts of the\r\ncountry, and I will have the pleasure to mention them further on, the\r\nmore so as they show what a quite average soil in these islands can\r\ngive when it is properly treated. But over large areas, especially\r\nin the southern counties, the general conditions are even worse than\r\nthey were twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nAltogether one cannot read the mass of review and newspaper articles,\r\nand books dealing with British agriculture that have been published\r\nlately, without realising that the agricultural depression which\r\nbegan in the “seventies” and the “eighties” of the nineteenth century\r\nhad causes much more deeply seated than the fall in the prices of\r\nwheat in consequence of American competition. However, it would lie\r\nbeyond the scope of this book to enter here into such a discussion.\r\nMoreover, anyone who will read a few review articles written from\r\nthe points of view of different parties, or consult such books as\r\nthat of Mr. Christopher Turnor,[42] or study the elaborate inquest\r\nmade by Rider Haggard in twenty-six counties of England--paying\r\nmore attention to the _data_ accumulated in this book than to\r\nthe sometimes biassed conclusions of the author--will soon see\r\nhimself what are the causes which hamper the development of British\r\nagriculture.[43]\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the conditions are equally bad. The population described\r\nas “rural” is in a steady decrease: in 1911 it was already less than\r\n800,000; and as regards the agricultural labourers, their number has\r\ndecreased by 42,370 (from 135,970 to 93,600) in the twenty years,\r\n1881 to 1901. _The land goes out of culture_, while the area under\r\n“deer forests”--that is, under hunting grounds established upon what\r\nformerly was _arable_ land for the amusement of the rich--increases\r\nat an appalling rate. No need to say that at the same time the Scotch\r\npopulation is emigrating, and Scotland is depopulated at an appalling\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nMy chief purpose being to show here what _can and ought to be_\r\nobtained from the land under a proper and intelligent treatment,\r\nI shall only indicate one of the disadvantages of the systems of\r\nhusbandry in vogue in this country. Both landlords and farmers\r\ngradually came of late to pursue other aims than that of obtaining\r\nfrom the land the greatest amount of produce than can be obtained;\r\nand when this problem of a maximum productivity of the land arose\r\nbefore the European nations, and therefore a complete modification of\r\nthe methods of husbandry was rendered imperative, such a modification\r\nwas _not_ accomplished in this country. While in France, Belgium,\r\nGermany and Denmark the agriculturists did their best to meet the\r\neffects of American competition by rendering their culture more\r\nintensive in all directions, in this country the already antiquated\r\nmethod of reducing the area under corn crops and laying land for\r\ngrass continues to prevail, although it ought to be evident that\r\nmere _grazing_ will pay no more, and that some effort in the right\r\ndirection would increase the returns of the corn crops, as also those\r\nof the roots and plants cultivated for industrial purposes. The land\r\ncontinues to go out of culture, while the problem of the day is to\r\nrender culture more and more intensive.\r\n\r\nMany causes have combined to produce that undesirable result. The\r\nconcentration of land-ownership in the hands of big landowners; the\r\nhigh profits obtained previously; the development of a class of both\r\nlandlords and farmers who rely chiefly upon other incomes than those\r\nthey draw from the land, and for whom farming has thus become a sort\r\nof pleasant by-occupation or sport; the rapid development of game\r\nreserves for sportsmen, both British and foreign; the absence of\r\nmen of initiative who would have shown to the nation the necessity\r\nof a new departure; the absence of a desire to win the necessary\r\nknowledge, and the absence of institutions which could widely spread\r\npractical agricultural knowledge and introduce improved seeds and\r\nseedlings, as the Experimental Farms of the United States and Canada\r\nare doing; the dislike of that spirit of agricultural co-operation to\r\nwhich the Danish farmers owe their successes, and so on--all these\r\nstand in the way of the unavoidable change in the methods of farming,\r\nand produce the results of which the British writers on agriculture\r\nare complaining.[44] But it is self-evident that in order to compete\r\nwith countries where machinery is largely used and new methods of\r\nfarming are resorted to (including the industrial treatment of farm\r\nproduce in sugar works, starch works, and the drying of vegetables,\r\netc., connected with farming), the old methods cannot do; especially\r\nwhen the farmer has to pay a rent of twenty, forty, and occasionally\r\nfifty shillings per acre for wheat-lands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may be said, of course, that this opinion strangely contrasts with\r\nthe well-known superiority of British agriculture. Do we not know,\r\nindeed, that British crops average twenty-eight to thirty bushels\r\nof wheat per acre, while in France they reach only from seventeen\r\nto twenty bushels? Does it not stand in all almanacs that Britain\r\ngets every year £200,000,000 sterling worth of animal produce--milk,\r\ncheese, meat and wool--from her fields? All that is true, and there\r\nis no doubt that in many respects British agriculture is superior to\r\nthat of many other nations. As regards obtaining the greatest amount\r\nof produce with the least amount of labour, Britain undoubtedly took\r\nthe lead until she was superseded by America in the Bonanza farms\r\n(now disappeared or rapidly disappearing). Again, as regards the fine\r\nbreeds of cattle, the splendid state of the meadows and the results\r\nobtained in separate farms, there is much to be learned from Britain.\r\nBut a closer acquaintance with British agriculture as a whole\r\ndiscloses many features of inferiority.\r\n\r\nHowever splendid, a meadow remains a meadow, much inferior in\r\nproductivity to a corn-field; and the fine breeds of cattle appear\r\nto be poor creatures as long as each ox requires three acres of land\r\nto be fed upon. As regards the crops, certainly one may indulge in\r\nsome admiration at the average twenty-eight or thirty bushels grown\r\nin this country; but when we learn that only 1,600,000 to 1,900,000\r\nacres out of the cultivable 33,000,000 bear such crops, we are quite\r\ndisappointed. Anyone could obtain like results if he were to put all\r\nhis manure into one-twentieth part of the area which he possesses.\r\nAgain, the twenty-eight to thirty bushels no longer appear to us so\r\nsatisfactory when we learn that without any manuring, merely by means\r\nof a good culture, they have obtained at Rothamstead an average of\r\n14 bushels per acre from the same plot of land for forty consecutive\r\nyears;[45] while Mr. Prout, in his farm near Sawbridgeworth (Herts),\r\non a cold heavy clay, has obtained since 1861 crops of from thirty\r\nto thirty-eight bushels of wheat, year after year, without any farm\r\nmanure at all, by good steam ploughing and artificial manure only.\r\n(R. Haggard, I. 528.) Under the allotment system the crops reach\r\nforty bushels. In some farms they occasionally attain even fifty and\r\nfifty-seven bushels per acre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Proportion of the cultivated area which is\r\ngiven to cereals altogether, and to wheat, in Great Britain and\r\nIreland.]\r\n\r\nIf we intend to have a correct appreciation of British agriculture,\r\nwe must not base it upon what is obtained on a few selected and\r\nwell-manured plots; we must inquire what is done with the territory,\r\ntaken as a whole.[46] Now, out of each 1,000 acres of the aggregate\r\nterritory of England, Wales and Scotland, 435 acres are left under\r\nwood, coppice, heath, buildings, and so on. We need not find fault\r\nwith that division, because it depends very much upon natural\r\ncauses. In France and Belgium one-third of the territory is in like\r\nmanner also treated as uncultivable, although portions of it are\r\ncontinually reclaimed and brought under culture. But, leaving\r\naside the “uncultivable” portion, let us see what is done with the\r\n565 acres out of 1,000 of the “cultivable” part (32,145,930 acres\r\nin Great Britain in 1910). First of all, it is divided into two\r\nparts, and one of them, the largest--308 acres out of 1,000--is left\r\nunder “permanent pasture,” that is, in most cases it is entirely\r\nuncultivated. Very little hay is obtained from it,[47] and some\r\ncattle are grazed upon it. More than one-half of the cultivable area\r\nis thus left without cultivation, and only 257 acres out of each\r\n1,000 acres are under culture. Out of these last, 124 acres are\r\nunder corn crops, twenty-one acres under potatoes, fifty-three acres\r\nunder green crops, and seventy-three acres under clover fields and\r\ngrasses under rotation. And finally, out of the 124 acres given to\r\ncorn crops, the best thirty-three, and some years only twenty-five\r\nacres (one-fortieth part of the territory, one-twenty-third of the\r\ncultivable area), are picked out and sown with wheat. They are\r\nwell cultivated, well manured, and upon them an average of from\r\ntwenty-eight to thirty bushels to the acre is obtained; and upon\r\nthese twenty-five or thirty acres out of 1,000 the world superiority\r\nof British agriculture is based.\r\n\r\nThe net result of all that is, that on nearly 33,000,000 acres\r\nof cultivable land the food is grown for one-third part only of\r\nthe population (more than two-thirds of the food it consumes\r\nis imported), and we may say accordingly that, although nearly\r\ntwo-thirds of the territory is cultivable, British agriculture\r\nprovides home-grown food for each 125 or 135 inhabitants only per\r\nsquare mile (out of 466). In other words, nearly three acres of the\r\n_cultivable area_ are required to grow the food for each person. Let\r\nus then see what is done with the land in France and Belgium.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow, if we simply compare the average thirty bushels per acre of\r\nwheat in Great Britain with the average nineteen to twenty bushels\r\ngrown in France within the last ten years, the comparison is all\r\nin favour of these islands; but such averages are of little value\r\nbecause the two systems of agriculture are totally different in\r\nthe two countries. The Frenchman also has his picked and heavily\r\nmanured “twenty-five to thirty acres” in the north of France and in\r\nIle-de-France, and from these picked acres he obtains average crops\r\nranging from thirty to thirty-three bushels.[48] However, he sows\r\nwith wheat, not only the best picked out acres, but also such fields\r\non the Central Plateau and in Southern France as hardly yield ten,\r\neight and even six bushels to the acre, without irrigation; and these\r\nlow crops reduce the average for the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman cultivates much that is left here under permanent\r\npasture--and this is what is described as his “inferiority” in\r\nagriculture. In fact, although the proportion between what we have\r\nnamed the “cultivable area” and the total territory is very much the\r\nsame in France as it is in Great Britain (624 acres out of each 1,000\r\nacres of the territory), the area under wheat crops is nearly _six\r\ntimes_ as great, in proportion, as what it is in Great Britain (182\r\nacres instead of twenty-five or thirty, out of each 1,000 acres): the\r\ncorn crops altogether cover nearly two-fifths of the cultivable area\r\n(375 acres out of 1000), and large areas are given besides to green\r\ncrops, industrial crops, vine, fruit and vegetables.\r\n\r\nTaking everything into consideration, although the Frenchman keeps\r\nless cattle, and especially grazes less sheep than the Briton, he\r\nnevertheless obtains from his soil nearly all the food that he and\r\nhis cattle consume. He imports, in an average year, but one-tenth\r\nonly of what the nation consumes, and he exports to this country\r\nconsiderable quantities of food produce (£10,000,000 worth), not only\r\nfrom the south, but also, and especially, from the shores of the\r\nChannel (Brittany butter and vegetables; fruit and vegetables from\r\nthe suburbs of Paris, and so on).[49]\r\n\r\nThe net result is that, although one-third part of the territory is\r\nalso treated as “uncultivable,” the soil of France yields the food\r\nfor 170 inhabitants per square mile (out of 188), that is, for forty\r\npersons more, per square mile, than this country.[50]\r\n\r\nIt is thus apparent that the comparison with France is not so much in\r\nfavour of this country as it is said to be; and it will be still less\r\nfavourable when we come, in our next chapter, to horticulture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe comparison with Belgium is even more striking--the more so\r\nas the two systems of culture are similar in both countries. To\r\nbegin with, in Belgium we also find an average crop of over thirty\r\nbushels of wheat to the acre; but the area given to wheat is five\r\ntimes as big as in Great Britain, in comparison to the cultivable\r\narea, and the cereals cover two-fifths of the land available for\r\nculture.[51] The land is so well cultivated that the average crops\r\nfor the years 1890-1899 (the very bad year of 1891 being left out\r\nof account) were from twenty-six and a half to twenty-eight and a\r\nhalf bushels per acre for winter wheat, and reached an average of\r\nthirty-three and a half bushels in 1900-1904; over fifty-four bushels\r\nfor oats (thirty-five to forty-one and a half in Great Britain),\r\nand from forty to forty-three and a half bushels for winter barley\r\n(twenty-nine to thirty-five in Great Britain); while on no less\r\nthan 475,000 acres catch crops of swedes (3,345,000 tons), carrots\r\n(155,000 tons), and more than 500,000 of lucerne and other grasses\r\nwere obtained.[52]\r\n\r\nAs to extraordinarily heavy crops, Mr. Seebohm Rowntree mentions,\r\nfor instance, the wheat crop in the commune of Oirbeck, near Louvain,\r\nwhich was, in 1906, on the average, fifty-seven bushels per acre,\r\nwhile the average of the whole country was only thirty-four bushels,\r\nor a yield of 111½ bushels of oats in the commune of Neuve-Eglise,\r\nwhile the average for Belgium was fifty-four bushels, and so on,\r\nthe average crops of several communes for some cereals being\r\nseventy-three per cent. in excess of the average for Belgium, and\r\nfrom 106 to 153 per cent. for roots.[53]\r\n\r\nAll taken, they grow in Belgium more than 76,000,000 bushels of\r\ncereals--that is, fifteen and seven-tenths bushels per acre of the\r\ncultivable area--while the corresponding figure for Great Britain is\r\nonly eight and a half bushels; and they keep almost twice as many\r\ncattle upon each cultivable acre as is kept in Great Britain.[54]\r\n\r\nMoreover, they even export cattle and horses. Up to 1890 Belgium\r\nexported from 36,000 to 94,000 head of cattle, from 42,000 to 70,000\r\nsheep, and from 60,000 to 108,600 swine. In 1890 these exports\r\nsuddenly came to an end--probably in consequence of a prohibition of\r\nsuch imports into Germany. Only horses continue to be exported to the\r\namount of about 25,000 horses and foals every year.\r\n\r\nLarge portions of the land are given besides to the culture of\r\nindustrial plants, potatoes for spirit, beet for sugar, and so on.\r\n\r\nHowever, it must not be believed that the soil of Belgium is more\r\nfertile than the soil of this country. On the contrary, to use the\r\nwords of Laveleye, “only one half, or less, of the territory offers\r\nnatural conditions which are favourable for agriculture”; the other\r\nhalf consists of a gravelly soil, or sands, “the natural sterility of\r\nwhich could be overpowered only by heavy manuring.” Man, not nature,\r\nhas given to the Belgium soil its present productivity. With this\r\nsoil and labour, Belgium succeeds in supplying nearly all the food\r\nof a population which is denser than that of England and Wales, and\r\nnumbers 589 inhabitants to the square mile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Proportion of the cultivated area which is\r\ngiven to cereals altogether, and to wheat, in Belgium. The square\r\nwhich encloses the wheat square represents the area given to both\r\nwheat and a mixture of wheat with rye.]\r\n\r\nIf the exports and imports of agricultural produce from and into\r\nBelgium be taken into account, we can ask ourselves whether\r\nLaveleye’s conclusions are not still good, and whether only one\r\ninhabitant out of each ten to twenty requires imported food. In the\r\nyears 1880-1885 the soil of Belgium supplied with home-grown food\r\nno less than 490 _inhabitants per square mile_, and there remained\r\nsomething for export--no less than £1,000,000 worth of agricultural\r\nproduce being exported every year to Great Britain. But it is not\r\npossible to say with certitude whether the conditions are the same at\r\nthe present time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Proportion of cultivated and uncultivated\r\nareas in Great Britain, Belgium, and France. _a_, Wheat; _b_, wheat\r\nand rye mixed; _c_, other cereals; _d′_, green crops; _d_, permanent\r\npasture; _e_, uncultivated.]\r\n\r\nSince 1880, when the duties on imported cereals were abolished\r\n(they were before that sixpence for each 220 lb.), and corn could be\r\nimported free, “the importers were no more obliged to make special\r\ndeclarations for merchandise which had to be re-exported; they\r\ndeclared their imports as if they were destined to be used within\r\nthe country.”[55] The result was, that while in the year 1870 the\r\nimports of cereals were 154 lb. per head of population, the same\r\nimports rose to 286 lb. in 1880. But no one can say how much of these\r\n286 lb. is consumed in Belgium itself; and if we deduct from the\r\ntotal of the imports the quantities re-exported the same year, we\r\nobtain figures which cannot be relied upon.[56] It is therefore safer\r\nto consider the figures of the _annual production_ of cereals in\r\nBelgium, such as they are given in the official _Annuaire_.\r\n\r\nNow, if we take the figures given in the _Annuaire Statistique de la\r\nBelgique_ for the year 1911, we come to the following results. The\r\nannual agricultural census, which is being made since 1901, gives for\r\nthe year 1909 that 2,290,300,000 lb. of wheat, rye, and wheat mixed\r\nwith rye were obtained on all the farms of Belgium larger than two\r\nand a half acres (2,002,000,000 lb. in 1895). Besides, 219,200,000\r\nlb. of barley, 1,393,000,000 lb. of oats, and a considerable quantity\r\nof oleaginous grains have been produced.\r\n\r\nIt is generally accepted that the average consumption of both winter\r\nand spring cereals attains 502 lb. per head of population; and as the\r\npopulation of Belgium was 7,000,000 on January 1, 1907, it appears\r\nthat no less than 3,524,400,000 lb. of cereals would have been\r\nrequired to supply the annual food of the population. If we compare\r\nthis figure with that of the annual production just mentioned, we\r\nsee then that, notwithstanding the considerable decrease of the area\r\ngiven to wheat since the abolition of the entrance duties, Belgium\r\nstill produces at least _two-thirds_ of the cereal food required for\r\nits very dense population, which is nearly 600 persons per square\r\nmile (596 in 1907).\r\n\r\nIt must be noticed that we should have come to a still higher figure\r\nif we took into account the other cereals (to say nothing of the\r\nleguminous plants and vegetables grown and consumed in Belgium),\r\nand still more so if we took into account what is grown upon the\r\nsmall holdings less than two and a half acres each. The number of\r\nsuch small holdings was 554,041 in 1895, and the number of people\r\nliving upon them reached nearly 2,000,000. _They are not included in\r\nthe official statistics, and yet upon most of them some cereals are\r\ngrown_, in addition to vegetables and fodder for cattle.\r\n\r\nIf Belgium produces in cereals the food of more than two-thirds\r\nof its very dense population, this is already a quite respectable\r\nfigure; but it must also be said that it exports every year\r\nconsiderable quantities of products of the soil. Thus, in the year\r\n1910 she exported 254,730 tons of vegetables (as against 187,000\r\nimported), 40,000 tons of fruit, 34,000 tons of plants and flowers\r\n(the whole nearly £3,000,000 worth), 256,000 of oleaginous grains,\r\n18,500 tons of wool, nearly 60,000 tons of flax, and so on. I do not\r\nmention the exports of butter, rabbits, skins, an immense quantity\r\nof sugar (about 180,000 tons), the vegetable oils and the spirits,\r\nbecause considerable quantities of beet and potatoes are imported. In\r\nshort, we have here _an export_ of agricultural produce grown in the\r\ncountry itself attaining the figure of 48s. per head of population.\r\n\r\nAll taken, there is thus no possibility of contesting the fact, that\r\nif the soil of Great Britain were cultivated only as the unfertile\r\nsoil of Belgium is cultivated--notwithstanding all the social\r\nobstacles which stand in the way of an intensive culture, in Belgium\r\nas elsewhere--a much greater part of the population of these islands\r\nwould obtain its food from the soil of its own land than is the case\r\nnowadays.[57]\r\n\r\nOn the other side it must not be forgotten that Belgium is a\r\nmanufacturing country which exports, moreover, manufactured home-made\r\ngoods to the value of 198s. per head of population, and 150s. worth\r\nof crude or half-manufactured produce, while the total exports from\r\nthe United Kingdom have only lately attained during the extraordinary\r\nyear of 1911 the value of 201s. per inhabitant. As to separate\r\nparts of the Belgian territory, the small and naturally unfertile\r\nprovince of West Flanders not only grew in 1890 the food of its 580\r\ninhabitants on the square mile, but exported agricultural produce\r\nto the value of 25s. per head of its population. And yet no one can\r\nread Laveleye’s masterly work without coming to the conclusion that\r\nFlemish agriculture would have realised still better results, were\r\nit not hampered in its growth by the steady and heavy increase of\r\nrent. In the face of the rent being increased each nine years, many\r\nfarmers have lately abstained from further improvements.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother example of what could be achieved by means of an effort of\r\nthe nation seconded by its educated classes is given by Denmark.\r\nAfter the war of 1864, which ended in the loss of one of their\r\nprovinces, the Danes made an effort widely to spread education\r\namongst their peasants, and to develop at the same time an intensive\r\nculture of the soil. The result of these efforts is now quite\r\nevident. The rural population of Denmark, instead of flocking to\r\nthe towns, has been increasing: in five years, 1906-1911, it rose\r\nfrom 1,565,585 to 1,647,350. Out of a total population of 2,775,100,\r\nno less than 990,900 find their living in agriculture, dairy work,\r\nand forestry. With a very poor soil, they have a cultivated area\r\na trifle below 7,000,000 acres, out of which 2,773,320 acres are\r\nunder cereals. Their wheat crops are on the average 40-6/10 bushels\r\nper acre, and the value of the home-grown food-stuffs is estimated\r\nat £40,000,000, which makes a little less than £6 per acre. As\r\nto their exports of home-grown produce, they exceed the imports\r\nby £14,483,000. The chief cause of these successes are: A highly\r\ndeveloped agricultural education, town markets accessible to all the\r\ngrowers, and, above all, co-operation, which again is a result of the\r\neffort that was made by the educated classes after the unfortunate\r\nwar of 1864.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that it is now Danish butter which rules the prices\r\nin the London market, and that this butter is of a high quality,\r\nwhich can only be attained in co-operative creameries with cold\r\nstorage and certain uniform methods in producing butter. But it is\r\nnot generally known that the Siberian butter, which is now imported\r\nin immense quantities into this country, is also a creation of the\r\nDanish co-operators. When they began to export their butter in large\r\nquantities, they used to import butter for their own use from the\r\nsouthern parts of the West Siberian provinces of Tobolsk and Tomsk,\r\nwhich are covered with prairies very similar to those of Winnipeg in\r\nCanada. At the outset this butter was of a most inferior quality,\r\nas it was made by every peasant household separately. The Danes\r\nbegan therefore to teach co-operation to the Russian peasants, and\r\nthey were rapidly understood by the intelligent population of this\r\nfertile region. The co-operative creameries began to spread with an\r\nastounding rapidity, without us knowing for some time wherefrom came\r\nthis interesting movement. At the present time a steamer loaded with\r\nSiberian butter leaves every week one of the Baltic ports and brings\r\nto London many thousands of casks of Siberian butter. If I am not\r\nwrong, Finland has also joined lately in the same export.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWithout going as far as China, I might quote similar examples from\r\nelsewhere, especially from Lombardy. But the above will be enough to\r\ncaution the reader against hasty conclusions as to the impossibility\r\nof feeding 46,000,000 people from 78,000,000 acres. They also will\r\nenable me to draw the following conclusions: (1) If the soil of the\r\nUnited Kingdom were cultivated only as it _was_ forty-five years ago,\r\n24,000,000 people, instead of 17,000,000, could live on home-grown\r\nfood; and this culture, while giving occupation to an additional\r\n750,000 men, would give nearly 3,000,000 wealthy home customers to\r\nthe British manufactures. (2) If the cultivable area of the United\r\nKingdom were cultivated as the soil is cultivated _on the average_ in\r\nBelgium, the United Kingdom would have food for at least 37,000,000\r\ninhabitants; and it might export agricultural produce without ceasing\r\nto manufacture, so as freely to supply all the needs of a wealthy\r\npopulation. And finally (3), if the population of this country came\r\nto be doubled, all that would be required for producing the food\r\nfor 90,000,000 inhabitants would be to cultivate the soil as it is\r\ncultivated in the best farms of this country, in Lombardy, and in\r\nFlanders, and to utilise some meadows, which at present lie almost\r\nunproductive, in the same way as the neighbourhoods of the big cities\r\nin France are utilised for market-gardening. All these are not fancy\r\ndreams, but mere realities; nothing but the modest conclusions from\r\nwhat we see round about us, without any allusion to the agriculture\r\nof the future.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf we want, however, to know what agriculture _can be_, and what can\r\nbe grown on a given amount of soil, we must apply for information\r\nto such regions as the district of Saffelare in East Flanders,\r\nthe island of Jersey, or the irrigated meadows of Lombardy, which\r\nare mentioned in the next chapter. Or else we may apply to the\r\nmarket-gardeners in this country, or in the neighbourhoods of Paris,\r\nor in Holland, or to the “truck farms” in America, and so on.\r\n\r\nWhile science devotes its chief attention to industrial pursuits, a\r\nlimited number of lovers of nature and a legion of workers whose very\r\nnames will remain unknown to posterity have created of late a quite\r\nnew agriculture, as superior to modern farming as modern farming is\r\nsuperior to the old three-fields system of our ancestors. Science\r\nseldom guided them, and sometimes misguided--as was the case with\r\nLiebig’s theories, developed to the extreme by his followers, who\r\ninduced us to treat plants as glass recipients of chemical drugs, and\r\nwho forgot that the only science capable of dealing with life and\r\ngrowth is physiology, not chemistry. Science seldom has guided them:\r\nthey proceeded in the empirical way; but, like the cattle-growers\r\nwho opened new horizons to biology, they have opened a new field\r\nof experimental research for the physiology of plants. They have\r\ncreated a totally new agriculture. They smile when we boast about the\r\nrotation system, having permitted us to take from the field one crop\r\nevery year, or four crops each three years, because their ambition\r\nis to have six and nine crops from the very same plot of land during\r\nthe twelve months. They do not understand our talk about good and bad\r\nsoils, because they make the soil themselves, and make it in such\r\nquantities as to be compelled yearly to sell some of it: otherwise\r\nit would raise up the level of their gardens by half an inch every\r\nyear. They aim at cropping, not five or six tons of grass on the\r\nacre, as we do, but from 50 to 100 tons of various vegetables on the\r\nsame space; not £5 worth of hay but £100 worth of vegetables, of the\r\nplainest description, cabbage and carrots, and more than £200 worth\r\nunder intensive horticultural treatment. This is where agriculture is\r\ngoing now.\r\n\r\nWe know that the dearest of all varieties of our staple food is\r\nmeat; and those who are not vegetarians, either by persuasion or\r\nby necessity, consume on the average 225 lb. of meat--that is,\r\nroughly speaking, a little less than the third part of an ox--every\r\nyear. And we have seen that, even in this country, and Belgium, two\r\nto three acres are wanted for keeping one head of horned cattle;\r\nso that a community of, say, 1,000,000 inhabitants would have to\r\nreserve somewhere about 1,000,000 acres of land for supplying it with\r\nmeat. But if we go to the farm of M. Goppart--one of the promoters\r\nof _ensilage_ in France--we shall see him growing, on a drained\r\nand well-manured field, no less than an average of 120,000 lb. of\r\ncorn-grass to the acre, which gives 30,000 lb. of dry hay--that is,\r\nthe food of one horned beast per acre. The produce is thus trebled.\r\n\r\nAs to beetroot, which is used also for feeding cattle, Mr. Champion,\r\nat Whitby, succeeded, with the help of sewage, in growing 100,000\r\nlb. of beet on each acre, and occasionally 150,000 and 200,000 lb.\r\nHe thus grew on each acre the food of, at least, two or three head\r\nof cattle. And such crops are not isolated facts; thus, M. Gros, at\r\nAutun, succeeds in cropping 600,000 lb. of beet and carrots, which\r\ncrop would permit him to keep four horned cattle on each acre. In\r\nfact, crops of 100,000 lb. of beet occur in numbers in the French\r\ncompetitions, and the success depends entirely upon good culture and\r\nappropriate manuring. It thus appears that while under ordinary high\r\nfarming we need 2,000,000 acres, or more, to keep 1,000,000 horned\r\ncattle, double that amount could be kept on one-half of that area;\r\nand if the density of population required it, the amount of cattle\r\ncould be doubled again, and the area required to keep it might still\r\nbe one-half, or even one-third of what it is now.[58]\r\n\r\n_French Gardening._--The above examples are striking enough, and\r\nyet those afforded by the market-gardening culture are still more\r\nstriking. I mean the culture carried on in the neighbourhood of big\r\ncities, and more especially the _culture maraîchère_ round Paris. In\r\nthis culture each plant is treated according to its age. The seeds\r\ngerminate and the seedlings develop their first four leaflets in\r\nespecially favourable conditions of soil and temperature; then the\r\nbest seedlings are picked out and transplanted into a bed of fine\r\nloam, under a frame or in the open air, where they freely develop\r\ntheir rootlets, and, gathered on a limited space, receive more than\r\nthe usual care. Only after this preliminary training are they bedded\r\nin the open ground, where they grow till ripe. In such a culture the\r\nprimitive condition of the soil is of little account, because loam\r\nis made out of the old forcing beds. The seeds are carefully tried,\r\nthe seedlings receive proper attention, and there is no fear of\r\ndrought, because of the variety of crops, the liberal watering with\r\nthe help of a steam engine, and the stock of plants always kept ready\r\nto replace the weakest individuals. Almost each plant is treated\r\nindividually.\r\n\r\nThere prevails, however, with regard to market-gardening, a\r\nmisunderstanding which it would be well to remove. It is generally\r\nsupposed that what chiefly attracts market-gardening to the great\r\ncentres of population is the market. It must have been so; and so it\r\nmay be still, but to some extent only. A great number of the Paris\r\n_maraîchers_, even of those who have their gardens within the walls\r\nof the city and whose main crop consists of vegetables in season,\r\nexport the whole of their produce to England. What chiefly attracts\r\nthe gardener to the great cities is stable manure; and this is not\r\nwanted so much for increasing the richness of the soil--one-tenth\r\npart of the manure used by the French gardeners would do for that\r\npurpose--but for keeping the soil at a certain temperature. Early\r\nvegetables pay best, and in order to obtain early produce not only\r\nthe air but the soil as well must be warmed; and this is done by\r\nputting great quantities of properly mixed manure into the soil;\r\nits fermentation heats it. But it is evident that with the present\r\ndevelopment of industrial skill, the heating of the soil could be\r\nobtained more economically and more easily by hot-water pipes.\r\nConsequently, the French gardeners begin more and more to make use\r\nof portable pipes, or _thermosiphons_, provisionally established in\r\nthe cool frames. This new improvement becomes of general use, and\r\nwe have the authority of Barral’s _Dictionnaire d’Agriculture_ to\r\naffirm that it gives excellent results. Under this system stable\r\nmanure is used mainly for producing loam.[59]\r\n\r\nAs to the different degrees of fertility of the soil--always the\r\nstumbling-block of those who write about agriculture--the fact\r\nis that in market-gardening the soil is always _made_, whatever\r\nit originally may have been. Consequently--we are told by Prof.\r\nDybowski, in the article “Maraîchers” in Barral’s _Dictionnaire\r\nd’Agriculture_--it is now a usual stipulation of the renting\r\ncontracts of the Paris _maraîchers_ that the gardener may carry\r\naway his soil, down to a certain depth, when he quits his tenancy.\r\nHe himself makes it, and when he moves to another plot he carts his\r\nsoil away, together with his frames, his water-pipes, and his other\r\nbelongings.[60]\r\n\r\nI could not relate here all the marvels achieved in market-gardening;\r\nso that I must refer the reader to works--most interesting\r\nworks--especially devoted to the subject, and give only a few\r\nillustrations.[61] Let us take, for instance, the orchard--the\r\n_marais_--of M. Ponce, the author of a well-known work on the\r\n_culture maraîchère_. His orchard covered only two and seven-tenths\r\nacres. The outlay for the establishment, including a steam engine for\r\nwatering purposes, reached £1,136. Eight persons, M. Ponce included,\r\ncultivated the orchard and carried the vegetables to the market, for\r\nwhich purpose one horse was kept; when returning from Paris they\r\nbrought in manure, for which £100 was spent every year. Another\r\n£100 was spent in rent and taxes. But how to enumerate all that was\r\ngathered every year on this plot of less than three acres, without\r\nfilling two pages or more with the most wonderful figures? One must\r\nread them in M. Ponce’s work, but here are the chief items: More\r\nthan 20,000 lb. of carrots; more than 20,000 lb. of onions, radishes\r\nand other vegetables sold by weight; 6,000 heads of cabbage; 3,000\r\nof cauliflower; 5,000 baskets of tomatoes; 5,000 dozen of choice\r\nfruit; and 154,000 heads of salad; in short, a total of 250,000 lb.\r\nof vegetables. The soil was made to such an amount out of forcing\r\nbeds that every year 250 cubic yards of loam had to be sold. Similar\r\nexamples could be given by the dozen, and the best evidence against\r\nany possible exaggeration of the results is the very high rent paid\r\nby the gardeners, which reaches in the suburbs of London from £10 to\r\n£15 per acre, and in the suburbs of Paris attains as much as £32 per\r\nacre. No less than 2,125 acres are cultivated round Paris in that\r\nway by 5,000 persons, and thus not only the 2,000,000 Parisians are\r\nsupplied with vegetables, but the surplus is also sent to London.\r\n\r\nThe above results are obtained with the help of warm frames,\r\nthousands of glass bells, and so on. But even without such costly\r\nthings, with only thirty-six yards of frames for seedlings,\r\nvegetables are grown _in the open air_ to the value of £200 per\r\nacre.[62] It is obvious, however, that in such cases the high selling\r\nprices of the crops are not due to the high prices fetched by early\r\nvegetables in winter; they are entirely due to the high crops of the\r\nplainest ones.\r\n\r\nLet me add also that all this wonderful culture has entirely\r\ndeveloped in the second half of the nineteenth century. Before that,\r\nit was quite primitive. But now the Paris gardener not only defies\r\nthe soil--he would grow the same crops on an asphalt pavement--he\r\ndefies climate. His walls, which are built to reflect light and\r\nto protect the wall-trees from the northern winds, his wall-tree\r\nshades and glass protectors, his frames and _pépinières_ have made\r\na real garden, a rich Southern garden, out of the suburbs of Paris.\r\nHe has given to Paris the “two degrees less of latitude” after\r\nwhich a French scientific writer was longing; he supplies his city\r\nwith mountains of grapes and fruit at any season; and in the early\r\nspring he inundates and perfumes it with flowers. But he does not\r\nonly grow articles of luxury. The culture of plain vegetables on a\r\nlarge scale is spreading every year; and the results are so good\r\nthat there are now practical _maraîchers_ who venture to maintain\r\nthat if all the food, animal and vegetable, necessary for 4,500,000\r\ninhabitants of the departments of Seine and Seine-et-Oise had to be\r\ngrown on their own territory (3,250 square miles), it could be grown\r\nwithout resorting to any other methods of culture than those already\r\nin use--methods already tested on a large scale and proved to be\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd yet the Paris gardener is not our ideal of an agriculturist. In\r\nthe painful work of civilisation he has shown us the way to follow;\r\nbut the ideal of modern civilisation is elsewhere. He toils, with\r\nbut a short interruption, from three in the morning till late in the\r\nnight. He knows no leisure; he has no time to live the life of a\r\nhuman being; the commonwealth does not exist for him; his world is\r\nhis garden, more than his family. He cannot be our ideal; neither\r\nhe nor his system of agriculture. Our ambition is, that he should\r\nproduce even _more_ than he does with _less_ labour, and should enjoy\r\nall the joys of human life. And this is fully possible.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, if we put aside those gardeners who chiefly\r\ncultivate the so-called _primeurs_--strawberries ripened in January,\r\nand the like--if we take only those who grow their crops in the\r\nopen field, and resort to frames exclusively for the earlier days\r\nof the life of the plant, and if we analyse their system, we see\r\nthat its very essence is, first, to create for the plant a nutritive\r\nand porous soil, which contains both the necessary decaying organic\r\nmatter and the inorganic compounds; and then to keep that soil and\r\nthe surrounding atmosphere at a temperature and moisture superior\r\nto those of the open air. The whole system is summed up in these\r\nfew words. If the French _maraîcher_ spends prodigies of labour,\r\nintelligence, and imagination in combining different kinds of\r\nmanure, so as to make them ferment at a given speed, he does so for\r\nno purpose but the above: a nourishing soil, and a desired equal\r\ntemperature and moisture of the air and the soil. All his empirical\r\nart is devoted to the achievement of these two aims. But both can\r\nalso be achieved in another and much easier way. The soil can be\r\n_improved_ by hand, but it need not be _made_ by hand. Any soil, of\r\nany desired composition, can be made by machinery. We already have\r\nmanufactures of manure, engines for pulverising the phosphorites, and\r\neven the granites of the Vosges; and we shall see manufactures of\r\nloam as soon as there is a demand for them.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that at present, when fraud and adulteration are\r\nexercised on such an immense scale in the manufacture of artificial\r\nmanure, and the manufacture of manure is considered as a chemical\r\nprocess, while it ought to be considered as a physiological one,\r\nthe gardener prefers to spend an unimaginable amount of labour\r\nrather than risk his crop by the use of a pompously labelled and\r\nunworthy drug. But that is a social obstacle which depends upon a\r\nwant of knowledge and a bad social organisation, not upon physical\r\ncauses.[63]\r\n\r\nOf course, the necessity of creating for the earlier life of the\r\nplant a warm soil and atmosphere will always remain, and sixty years\r\nago Léonce de Lavergne foretold that the next step in culture would\r\nbe to warm the soil. But heating pipes give the same results as the\r\nfermenting manures at a much smaller expense of human labour. And\r\nalready the system works on a large scale, as will be seen from the\r\nnext chapter. Through it the productive powers of a given area of\r\nland are increased more than a hundred times.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that now, when the capitalist system makes us pay for\r\neverything three or four times its labour value, we often spend\r\nabout £1 for each square yard of a heated conservatory. But how many\r\nmiddlemen are making fortunes on the wooden sashes imported from\r\nDrontheim? If we only could reckon our expenses in labour, we should\r\ndiscover to our amazement that, thanks to the use of machinery, the\r\nsquare yard of a conservatory does not cost more than half a day of\r\nhuman labour; and we will see presently that the Jersey and Guernsey\r\naverage for cultivating one acre under glass is only three men\r\nworking ten hours a day. Therefore the conservatory, which formerly\r\nwas a luxury, is rapidly entering into the domain of high culture.\r\nAnd we may foresee the day when the glass conservatory will be\r\nconsidered as a necessary appendix to the field, both for the growth\r\nof those fruits and vegetables which cannot succeed in the open air,\r\nand for the preliminary training of most cultural plants during the\r\nearlier stages of their life.\r\n\r\nHome-grown fruit is always preferable to the half-ripe produce which\r\nis imported from abroad, and the additional work required for keeping\r\na young plant under glass is largely repaid by the incomparable\r\nsuperiority of the crops. As to the question of labour, when we\r\nremember the incredible amount of labour which has been spent on the\r\nRhine and in Switzerland for making the vineyards, their terraces,\r\nand stone walls, and for carrying the soil up the stony crags, as\r\nalso the amount of labour which is spent every year for the culture\r\nof those vineyards and fruit gardens, we are inclined to ask, which\r\nof the two, all taken, requires less of human labour--a vinery (I\r\nmean the cold vinery) in a London suburb, or a vineyard on the\r\nRhine, or on Lake Leman? And when we compare the prices realised by\r\nthe grower of grapes round London (not those which are paid in the\r\nWest-end fruit shops, but those received by the grower for his grapes\r\nin September and October) with those current in Switzerland or on\r\nthe Rhine during the same months, we are inclined to maintain that\r\nnowhere in Europe, beyond the forty-fifth degree of latitude, are\r\ngrapes grown at less expense of human labour, both for capital outlay\r\nand yearly work, than in the vineries of the London and Brussels\r\nsuburbs.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, let us not overrate the productivity of the exporting\r\ncountries, and let us remember that the vine-growers of Southern\r\nEurope drink themselves an abominable _piquette_; that Marseilles\r\nfabricates wine for home use out of dry raisins brought from Asia;\r\nand that the Normandy peasant who sends his apples to London, drinks\r\nreal cider only on great festivities. Such a state of things will\r\nnot last for ever; and the day is not far when we shall be compelled\r\nto look to our own resources to provide many of the things which we\r\nnow import. And we shall not be the worse for that. The resources of\r\nscience, both in enlarging the circle of our production and in new\r\ndiscoveries, are inexhaustible. And each new branch of activity calls\r\ninto existence more and more new branches, which steadily increase\r\nthe power of man over the forces of nature.\r\n\r\nIf we take all into consideration; if we realise the progress made\r\nof late in the gardening culture, and the tendency towards spreading\r\nits methods to the open field; if we watch the cultural experiments\r\nwhich are being made now--experiments to-day and realities\r\nto-morrow--and ponder over the resources kept in store by science,\r\nwe are bound to say that _it is utterly impossible to foresee at the\r\npresent moment the limits as to the_ maximum _number of human beings\r\nwho could draw their means of subsistence from a given area of land_,\r\nor as to what a variety of produce they could advantageously grow in\r\nany latitude. Each day widens former limits, and opens new and wide\r\nhorizons. All we can say now is, that, _even now_, 600 persons could\r\neasily live on a square mile; and that, with cultural methods already\r\nused on a large scale, 1,000 human beings--not idlers--living on\r\n1,000 acres could easily, without any kind of overwork, obtain from\r\nthat area a luxurious vegetable and animal food, as well as the flax,\r\nwool, silk, and hides necessary for their clothing. As to what may\r\nbe obtained under still more perfect methods--also known but not yet\r\ntested on a large scale--it is better to abstain from any forecast:\r\nso unexpected are the recent achievements of intensive culture.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the over-population fallacy does not stand the very\r\nfirst attempt at submitting it to a closer examination. Those only\r\ncan be horror-stricken at seeing the population of this country\r\nincrease by one individual every 1,000 seconds who think of a human\r\nbeing as a mere claimant upon the stock of material wealth of\r\nmankind, without being at the same time a contributor to that stock.\r\nBut we, who see in each new-born babe a future _worker_ capable of\r\nproducing much more than his own share of the common stock--we greet\r\nhis appearance.\r\n\r\nWe know that a crowded population is a necessary condition for\r\npermitting man to increase the productive powers of his labour. We\r\nknow that highly productive labour is impossible so long as men are\r\nscattered, few in numbers, over wide territories, and are thus unable\r\nto combine together for the higher achievements of civilisation. We\r\nknow what an amount of labour must be spent to scratch the soil with\r\na primitive plough, to spin and weave by hand; and we know also how\r\nmuch less labour it costs to grow the same amount of food and weave\r\nthe same cloth with the help of modern machinery.\r\n\r\nWe also see that it is infinitely easier to grow 200,000 lb. of food\r\non one acre than to grow them on ten acres. It is all very well\r\nto imagine that wheat grows by itself on the Russian steppes; but\r\nthose who have seen how the peasant toils in the “fertile” black\r\nearth region will have one desire: that the increase of population\r\nmay permit the use of the steam-digger and gardening culture in the\r\nsteppes; that it may permit those who are now the beasts of burden of\r\nhumanity to raise their backs and to become at last men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe must, however, recognise that there are a few economists fully\r\naware of the above truths. They gladly admit that Western Europe\r\ncould grow much more food than it does; but they see no necessity nor\r\nadvantage in doing so, as long as there are nations which can supply\r\nfood in exchange for manufactured goods. Let us then examine how far\r\nthis view is correct.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that if we are satisfied with merely stating that it is\r\ncheaper to bring wheat from Riga than to grow it in Lincolnshire, the\r\nwhole question is settled in a moment. But is it so in reality? Is it\r\nreally cheaper to have food from abroad? And, supposing it is, are we\r\nnot yet bound to analyse that compound result which we call price,\r\nrather than to accept it as a supreme and blind ruler of our actions?\r\n\r\nWe know, for instance, how French agriculture is burdened by\r\ntaxation. And yet, if we compare the prices of articles of food in\r\nFrance, which herself grows most of them, with the prices in this\r\ncountry, which imports them, we find no difference in favour of the\r\nimporting country. On the contrary, the balance is rather in favour\r\nof France, and it decidedly was so for wheat until the new protective\r\ntariff was introduced. As soon as one goes out of Paris, one finds\r\nthat every _home produce_ is cheaper in France than it is in England,\r\nand that the prices decrease further when we go farther East on the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nThere is another feature still more unfavourable for this country:\r\nnamely, the enormous development of the class of middlemen who\r\nstand between the importer and the home producer on the one side\r\nand the consumer on the other. We have lately heard a good deal\r\nabout the quite disproportionate part of the prices we pay which\r\ngoes into the middleman’s pockets. We have all heard of the East-end\r\nclergyman who was compelled to become butcher in order to save his\r\nparishioners from the greedy middleman. We read in the papers that\r\nmany farmers of the midland counties do not realise more than 9d.\r\nfor a pound of butter, while the customer pays from 1s. 6d. to 1s.\r\n8d.; and that from 1½d. to 2d. for the quart of milk is all that the\r\nCheshire farmers can get, while we pay 4d. for the adulterated, and\r\n5d. for the unadulterated milk. An analysis of the Covent Garden\r\nprices and a comparison of the same with retail prices, which is\r\nbeing made from time to time in the daily papers, proves that the\r\ncustomer pays for vegetables at the rate of 6d. to 1s., and sometimes\r\nmore, for each penny realised by the grower. But in a country of\r\nimported food it _must_ be so: the grower who himself sells his own\r\nproduce disappears from its markets, and in his place appears the\r\nmiddleman.[64] If we move, however, towards the East, and go to\r\nBelgium, Germany, and Russia, we find that the cost of living is\r\nmore and more reduced, so that finally we find that in Russia, which\r\nremains still agricultural, wheat costs one-half or two-thirds of its\r\nLondon prices, and meat is sold throughout the provinces at about\r\nten farthings (kopecks) the pound. And we may therefore hold that it\r\nis not yet proved at all that it is cheaper to live on imported food\r\nthan to grow it ourselves.\r\n\r\nBut if we analyse _price_, and make a distinction between its\r\ndifferent elements, the disadvantage becomes still more apparent.\r\nIf we compare, for instance, the costs of growing wheat in this\r\ncountry and in Russia, we are told that in the United Kingdom the\r\nhundredweight of wheat cannot be grown at less than 8s. 7d.; while\r\nin Russia the costs of production of the same hundredweight are\r\nestimated at from 3s. 6d. to 4s. 9d.[65] The difference is enormous,\r\nand it would still remain very great even if we admit that there is\r\nsome exaggeration in the former figure. But why this difference? Are\r\nthe Russian labourers paid so much less for their work? Their money\r\nwages surely are much lower, but the difference is equalised as soon\r\nas we reckon their wages in produce. The twelve shillings a week\r\nof the British agricultural labourer represents the same amount of\r\nwheat in Britain as the six shillings a week of the Russian labourer\r\nrepresents in Russia. As to the supposed prodigious fertility of\r\nthe soil in the Russian prairies, it is a fallacy. Crops of from\r\nsixteen to twenty-three bushels per acre are considered good crops\r\nin Russia, while the average hardly reaches thirteen bushels, even\r\nin the corn-exporting parts of the empire. Besides, the amount\r\nof labour which is necessary to grow wheat in Russia with no\r\nthrashing-machines, with a plough dragged by a horse hardly worth\r\nthe name, with no roads for transport, and so on, is certainly much\r\ngreater than the amount of labour which is necessary to grow the same\r\namount of wheat in Western Europe.\r\n\r\nWhen brought to the London market, Russian wheat was sold in 1887\r\nat 31s. the quarter, while it appeared from the same _Mark Lane\r\nExpress_ figures that the quarter of wheat could not be grown in\r\nthis country at less than 36s. 8d., even if the straw be sold, which\r\nis not always the case. But the difference of the land rent in both\r\ncountries would alone account for the difference of prices. In the\r\nwheat belt of Russia, where the average rent stood at about 12s.\r\nper acre, and the crop was from fifteen to twenty bushels, the rent\r\namounted to from 3s. 6d. to 5s. 8d. in the costs of production of\r\neach quarter of Russian wheat; while in this country, where the rent\r\nand taxes are valued (in the _Mark Lane Express_ figures) at no less\r\nthan 40s. per each wheat-growing acre, and the crop is taken at\r\nthirty bushels, the rent amounts to 10s. in the costs of production\r\nof each quarter.[66] But even if we take only 30s. per acre of rent\r\nand taxes, and an average crop of twenty-eight bushels, we still have\r\n8s. 8d. out of the sale price of each quarter of wheat, which goes to\r\nthe landlord and the State. If it costs so much more in money to grow\r\nwheat in this country, while the amount of labour is so much less in\r\nthis country than in Russia, it is due to the very great height of\r\nthe land rents attained during the years 1860-1880. But this growth\r\nitself was due to the facilities for realising large profits on the\r\nsale of manufactured goods abroad. The false condition of British\r\nrural economy, not the infertility of the soil, is thus the chief\r\ncause of the Russian competition.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years have passed since I wrote these lines--the\r\nagricultural crisis provoked by the competition of cheap American\r\nwheat being at that time at its climax, and, I am sorry to say, I\r\nmust leave these lines such as they were written. I do not mean,\r\nof course, that no adaptation to the new conditions created by\r\nthe fall in the prices of wheat should have taken place during\r\nthe last quarter of a century, in the sense of a more intensive\r\nculture and a better utilisation of the land. On the contrary, I\r\nmention in different parts of this book the progress accomplished\r\nof late in the development of separate branches of intensive\r\nculture, such as fruit-culture, market-gardening, culture under\r\nglass, French gardening, and poultry farming, and I also indicate\r\nthe different steps taken to promote further improvements, such as\r\nbetter conditions of transport, co-operation among the farmers, and\r\nespecially the development of small holdings.\r\n\r\nHowever, after having taken into account all these improvements,\r\none cannot but see with regret that the same regressive movement in\r\nBritish agriculture, which began in the ’seventies, continues still;\r\nand while more and more of the land that was once under the plough\r\ngoes out of culture, no corresponding increase in the quantities of\r\nlive stock is to be seen. And if we consult the mass of books and\r\nreview articles which have been dealing lately with this subject, we\r\nsee that all the writers recognise that British agriculture _must_\r\nadapt itself to the new conditions by a thorough reform of its\r\ngeneral character; and yet the same writers recognise that only a\r\nfew steps were taken till now in the proper direction, and none of\r\nthem was taken with a sufficient energy. Society at large remains\r\nindifferent to the needs of British agriculture.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that the competition of American wheat\r\nhas made the same havoc in the agriculture of most European\r\ncountries--especially in France and Belgium; but in the last two\r\ncountries the adaptations which were necessary to resist the\r\neffects of the competition have already taken place to a great\r\nextent. Both in Belgium and in France the American imports gave a\r\nnew impetus toward a more intensive utilisation of the soil, and\r\nthis impetus was strongest in Belgium, where no attempt was made\r\nto protect agriculture by an increase of the import duties, as was\r\nthe case in France. On the contrary, the duties upon imported wheat\r\nwere abolished in Belgium precisely at the time when the American\r\ncompetition began to be felt--that is, between 1870 and 1880.\r\n\r\nIt was not only in England that the fall in the prices of wheat was\r\nfelt acutely by the farmers. In France, the hectolitre of wheat (very\r\nnearly three bushels), which was sold at 18s. 10d. in 1871-1875,\r\nfell to 15s. 5d. in 1881-1885, and to 12s. 6d. in 1893; and the same\r\nmust have been in Belgium, the more so as the protective duties were\r\nabolished. But here is what Mr. Seebohm Rowntree says about the\r\neffect of the prices in his admirable book on land and labour in\r\nBelgium:--\r\n\r\n  “For a time the Belgian agriculturist was hardly hit, but\r\n  gradually he adjusted himself to the new conditions. His\r\n  cultivation became more intensive, he made more and more use of\r\n  co-operation in various directions, and he devoted himself to new\r\n  branches of agriculture, especially the raising of live stock\r\n  and garden produce. He began to realise the value of artificial\r\n  manures, and to acknowledge that science could help him.”--_Land\r\n  and Labour_, p. 147.\r\n\r\nThese words by Mr. Rowntree are fully confirmed by the change in\r\nthe general aspects of the Belgian agriculture, as they appear from\r\nthe official statistical data. The same must be said of France. The\r\nabove-mentioned fall in prices induced agriculturists to intensify\r\ntheir methods of culture. I have mentioned already the rapid\r\nspreading of agricultural machinery among the French peasants during\r\nthe last twenty years; and I must mention also the equally remarkable\r\nincrease in the amounts of chemical manure used by the peasants;\r\nthe sudden development of agricultural syndicates since 1884; the\r\nextension taken by co-operation; the new organisation of transport\r\nwith cool storage, or in heated cars, for the export of fruit and\r\nflowers; the development taken by special industrial cultures; and\r\nstill more so the immense development of gardening in the South of\r\nFrance and market-gardening in the North. All these adaptations were\r\nintroduced on such a scale that one is bound to recognise that the\r\ncrisis has had the effect of giving quite a new aspect to French\r\nagriculture, taken as a whole.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMuch more ought to be said with regard to the American competition,\r\nand therefore I must refer the reader to the remarkable series\r\nof articles dealing with the whole of the subject which\r\nSchaeffle published in 1886 in the _Zeitschrift für die gesammte\r\nStaatswissenschaft_, and to the most elaborate article on the costs\r\nof growing wheat all over the world which appeared in April, 1887, in\r\nthe _Quarterly Review_. These articles were written at the time when\r\nAmerican competition was something new and made much havoc in English\r\nagriculture, causing a fall of from 30 to 50 per cent. in the rents\r\nof land for agricultural purposes. But the conclusions of these two\r\nwriters were fully corroborated by the yearly reports of the American\r\nBoard of Agriculture, and Schaeffle’s previsions were fully confirmed\r\nby the subsequent reports of Mr. J. R. Dodge. It appeared from these\r\nworks that the fertility of the American soil had been grossly\r\nexaggerated, as the masses of wheat which America sent to Europe from\r\nits north-western farms were grown on a soil the natural fertility of\r\nwhich is not higher, and often lower, than the average fertility of\r\nthe unmanured European soil. The Casselton farm in Dakota, with its\r\ntwenty bushels per acre, was an exception; while the average crop of\r\nthe chief wheat-growing States in the West was only eleven to twelve\r\nbushels. In order to find a fertile soil in America, and crops of\r\nfrom thirty to forty bushels, one must go to the old Eastern States,\r\nwhere the soil is made by man’s hands.[67]\r\n\r\nThe same applies to the American supplies of meat. Schaeffle pointed\r\nout that the great mass of live stock which appeared in the census\r\nof cattle in the States was not reared in the prairies, but in\r\nthe stables of the farms, in the same way as in Europe; as to the\r\nprairies, he found on them only one-eleventh part of the American\r\nhorned cattle, one-fifth of the sheep and one-twenty-first of the\r\npigs.[68] “Natural fertility” being thus out of question, we must\r\nlook for social causes; and we have them, for the Western States,\r\nin the cheapness of land and a proper organisation of production;\r\nand for the Eastern States in the rapid progress of _intensive_ high\r\nfarming.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the methods of culture must vary according to\r\ndifferent conditions. In the vast prairies of North America, where\r\nland could be _bought_ from 8s. to 40s. the acre, and where spaces\r\nof from 100 to 150 square miles in one block could be given to wheat\r\nculture, special methods of culture were applied and the results were\r\nexcellent. Land was bought--not rented. In the autumn, whole studs\r\nof horses were brought, and the tilling and sowing were done with\r\nthe aid of formidable ploughs and sowing machines. Then the horses\r\nwere sent to graze in the mountains; the men were dismissed, and one\r\nman, occasionally two or three, remained to winter on the farm. In\r\nthe spring the owners’ agents began to beat the inns for hundreds of\r\nmiles round, and engaged labourers and tramps, both freely supplied\r\nby Europe, for the crop. Battalions of men were marched to the wheat\r\nfields, and were camped there; the horses were brought from the\r\nmountains, and in a week or two the crop was cut, thrashed, winnowed,\r\nput in sacks, by specially invented machines, and sent to the next\r\nelevator, or directly to the ships which carried it to Europe.\r\nWhereupon the men were disbanded again, the horses were sent back to\r\nthe grazing grounds, or sold, and again only a couple of men remained\r\non the farm.\r\n\r\nThe crop from each acre was small, but the machinery was so\r\nperfected that in this way 300 days of one man’s labour produced\r\nfrom 200 to 300 quarters of wheat; in other words--the area of land\r\nbeing of no account--every man produced in one day his yearly bread\r\nfood (eight and a half bushels of wheat); and taking into account\r\nall subsequent labour, it was calculated that the work of 300 men in\r\none single day delivered to the consumer at Chicago the flour that\r\nis required for the yearly food of 250 persons. Twelve hours and a\r\nhalf of work are thus required in Chicago to supply one man with his\r\nyearly provision of wheat-flour.\r\n\r\nUnder the special conditions offered in the Far West this certainly\r\nwas an appropriate method for increasing all of a sudden the wheat\r\nsupplies of mankind. It answered its purpose when large territories\r\nof unoccupied land were opened to enterprise. But it could not\r\nanswer for ever. Under such a system of culture the soil was soon\r\nexhausted, the crop declined, and _intensive_ agriculture (which\r\naims at high crops on a limited area) had soon to be resorted to.\r\nSuch was the case in Iowa in the year 1878. Up till then, Iowa was\r\nan emporium for wheat-growing on the lines just indicated. But the\r\nsoil was already exhausted, and when a disease came the wheat plants\r\nhad no force to resist it. In a few weeks nearly all the wheat crop,\r\nwhich was expected to beat all previous records, was lost; eight to\r\nten bushels per acre of bad wheat were all that could be cropped.\r\nThe result was that “mammoth farms” had to be broken up into small\r\nfarms, and that the Iowa farmers (after a terrible crisis of short\r\nduration--everything is rapid in America) took to a more intensive\r\nculture. Now, they are not behind France in wheat culture, as they\r\nalready grow an average of sixteen and a half bushels per acre on an\r\narea of more than 2,000,000 acres, and they will soon win ground.\r\nSomehow, with the aid of manure and improved methods of farming, they\r\ncompete admirably with the mammoth farms of the Far West.\r\n\r\nIn fact, over and over again it was pointed out, by Schaeffle,\r\nSemler, Oetken, and many other writers, that the force of “American\r\ncompetition” is not in its mammoth farms, but in the countless small\r\nfarms upon which wheat is grown in the same way as it is grown\r\nin Europe--that is, with manuring--but with a better organised\r\nproduction and facilities for sale, and without being compelled\r\nto pay to the landlord a toll of one-third part, or more, of the\r\nselling price of each quarter of wheat. However, it was only after\r\nI had myself made a tour in the prairies of Manitoba in 1897, and\r\nthose of Ohio in 1901, that I could realise the full truth of\r\nthe just-mentioned views. The 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 bushels\r\nof wheat, which are exported every year from Manitoba, are grown\r\nalmost entirely in farms of one or two “quarter-sections”--that is,\r\nof 160 and 320 acres. The ploughing is made in the usual way, and\r\nin an immense majority of cases the farmers buy the reaping and\r\nbinding machines (the “binders”) by associating in groups of four.\r\nThe thrashing machine is rented by the farmer for one or two days,\r\nand the farmer carts his wheat to the elevator with his own horses,\r\neither to sell it immediately, or to keep it at the elevator if he is\r\nin no immediate need of money and hopes to get a higher price in one\r\nmonth or two. In short, in Manitoba one is especially struck with the\r\nfact that, even under a system of keen competition, the middle-size\r\nfarm has completely beaten the old mammoth farm, and that it is not\r\nmanufacturing wheat on a grand scale which pays best. It is also most\r\ninteresting to note that thousands and thousands of farmers produce\r\nmountains of wheat in the Canadian province of Toronto and in the\r\nEastern States, although the land is not prairie-land at all, and the\r\nfarms are, as a rule, small.\r\n\r\nThe force of “American competition” is thus not in the possibility\r\nof having hundreds of acres of wheat in one block. It lies in the\r\nownership of the land, in a system of culture which is appropriate\r\nto the character of the country, in a widely developed spirit of\r\nassociation, and, finally, in a number of institutions and customs\r\nintended to lift the agriculturist and his profession to a high level\r\nwhich is unknown in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn Europe we do not realise at all what is done in the States and\r\nCanada in the interests of agriculture. In every American State, and\r\nin every distinct region of Canada, there is an experimental farm,\r\nand all the work of preliminary experiment upon new varieties of\r\nwheat, oats, barley, fodder and fruit, which the farmer has mostly to\r\nmake himself in Europe, is made under the best scientific conditions\r\nat the experimental farms, on a small scale first and on a large\r\nscale next. The results of all these researches and experiments are\r\nnot merely rendered accessible to the farmer who would like to know\r\nthem, but they are brought to his knowledge, and, so to speak, are\r\nforced upon his attention by every possible means. The “Bulletins” of\r\nthe experimental stations are distributed in hundreds of thousands\r\nof copies; visits to the farms are organised in such a way that\r\nthousands of farmers should inspect the stations every year, and be\r\nshown by specialists the results obtained, either with new varieties\r\nof plants or under various new methods of treatment. Correspondence\r\nis carried on with the farmers on such a scale that, for instance,\r\nat Ottawa, the experimental farm sends out every year a hundred\r\nthousand letters and packets. Every farmer can get, free of charge\r\nand postage, five pounds of seed of any variety of cereals, out of\r\nwhich he can get next year the necessary seed for sowing several\r\nacres. And, finally, in every small and remote township there are\r\nheld farmers’ meetings, at which special lecturers, who are sent\r\nout by the experimental farms or the local agricultural societies,\r\ndiscuss with the farmers in an informal way the results of last\r\nyear’s experiments and discoveries relative to every branch of\r\nagriculture, horticulture, cattle-breeding, dairying and agricultural\r\nco-operation.[69]\r\n\r\nAmerican agriculture really offers an imposing sight--not in the\r\nwheat fields of the Far West, which soon will become a thing of\r\nthe past, but in the development of rational agriculture and the\r\nforces which promote it. Read the description of an agricultural\r\nexhibition, “the State’s fair,” in some small town of Iowa, with\r\nits 70,000 farmers camping with their families in tents during the\r\nfair’s week, studying, learning, buying, and selling, and enjoying\r\nlife. You see a _national_ fête, and you feel that you deal with a\r\nnation in which agriculture is in respect. Or read the publications\r\nof the scores of experimental stations, whose reports are distributed\r\nbroadcast over the country, and are read by the farmers and discussed\r\nat countless “farmers’ meetings.” Consult the “Transactions” and\r\n“Bulletins” of the countless agricultural societies, not royal but\r\npopular; study the grand enterprises for irrigation; and you will\r\nfeel that American agriculture is a real force, imbued with life,\r\nwhich no longer fears mammoth farms, and needs not to cry like a\r\nchild for protection.\r\n\r\n“Intensive” agriculture and gardening are already by this time as\r\nmuch a feature of the treatment of the soil in America as they are\r\nin Belgium. As far back as the year 1880, nine States, among which\r\nwere Georgia, Virginia and the two Carolinas, bought £5,750,000\r\nworth of artificial manure; and we are told that by this time the\r\nuse of artificial manure has immensely spread towards the West. In\r\nIowa, where mammoth farms used to exist twenty years ago, sown grass\r\nis already in use, and it is highly recommended by both the Iowa\r\nAgricultural Institute and the numerous local agricultural papers;\r\nwhile at the agricultural competitions the highest rewards are given,\r\nnot for extensive farming, but for high crops on small areas. Thus,\r\nat a recent competition in which hundreds of farmers took part, the\r\nfirst ten prizes were awarded to ten farmers who had grown, on three\r\nacres each, from 262 to 346¾ bushels of Indian corn, in other words\r\n_from 87 to 115 bushels to the acre_. This shows where the ambition\r\nof the Iowa farmer goes. In Minnesota, prizes were given already for\r\ncrops of 300 to 1,120 bushels of potatoes to the acre--that is, from\r\neight and a quarter to thirty-one tons to the acre--while the average\r\npotato crop in Great Britain is only six tons.\r\n\r\nAt the same time market-gardening is immensely extending in America.\r\nIn the market-gardens of Florida we see such crops as 445 to 600\r\nbushels of onions per acre, 400 bushels of tomatoes, 700 bushels of\r\nsweet potatoes, which testify to a high development of culture. As\r\nto the “truck farms” (market-gardening for export by steamer and\r\nrail), they covered, in 1892, 400,000 acres, and the fruit farms in\r\nthe suburbs of Norfolk, in Virginia, were described by Prof. Ch.\r\nBaltet[70] as real _models_ of that sort of culture--a very high\r\ntestimony in the mouth of a French gardener who himself comes from\r\nthe model _marais_ of Troyes.\r\n\r\nAnd while people in London continue to pay almost all the year\r\nround twopence for a lettuce (very often imported from Paris), they\r\nhave at Chicago and Boston those unique establishments in the world\r\nwhere lettuces are grown in immense greenhouses with the aid of\r\nelectric light; and we must not forget that although the discovery of\r\n“electric” growth is European (it is due to Siemens), it was at the\r\nCornell University that it was proved by a series of experiments that\r\nelectric light is an admirable aid for forwarding the growth of the\r\n_green_ parts of the plant.\r\n\r\nIn short, America, which formerly took the lead in bringing\r\n“extensive” agriculture to perfection, now takes the lead in\r\n“intensive,” or forced, agriculture as well. In this adaptability\r\nlies the real force of American competition.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[34] I leave these lines on purpose as they were written for the\r\nfirst edition of this book.\r\n\r\n[35] Twenty-three per cent. of the total area of England, 40 per\r\ncent. in Wales, and 75 per cent. in Scotland are now under wood,\r\ncoppice, mountain heath, water, etc. The remainder--that is,\r\n32,777,513 acres--which were under culture and permanent pasture\r\nin the year 1890 (only 32,094,658 in 1911), may be taken as the\r\n“cultivable” area of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[36] Average area under wheat in 1853-1860, 4,092,160 acres; average\r\ncrop, 14,310,779 quarters. Average area under wheat in 1884-1887,\r\n2,509,055 acres; average crop (good years), 9,198,956 quarters.\r\nSee Professor W. Fream’s _Rothamstead Experiments_ (London, 1888),\r\npage 83. I take in the above Sir John Lawes’ figure of 5·65 bushels\r\nper head of population every year. It is very close to the yearly\r\nallowance of 5·67 bushels of the French statisticians. The Russian\r\nstatisticians reckon 5·67 bushels of winter crops (chiefly rye) and\r\n2·5 bushels of spring crops (sarrazin, barley, etc.).\r\n\r\n[37] There was an increase of 1,800,000 head of horned cattle, and\r\na decrease of 4¼ million sheep (6⅔ millions, if we compare the year\r\n1886 with 1868), which would correspond to an increase of 1¼ million\r\nof units of cattle, because eight sheep are reckoned as equivalent\r\nto one head of horned cattle. But five million acres having been\r\nreclaimed upon waste land since 1860, the above increase should\r\nhardly do for covering that area, so that the 2¼ million acres which\r\nwere cultivated no longer remained fully uncovered. They were a pure\r\nloss to the nation.\r\n\r\n[38] According to a report read by Mr. Crawford before the\r\nStatistical Society in October, 1899, Britain imports every year\r\n4,500,000 tons of hay and other food for its cattle and horses. Under\r\nthe present system of culture, 6,000,000 acres could produce these\r\nfood-stuffs. If another 6,000,000 acres were sown with cereals, all\r\nthe wheat required for the United Kingdom could have been produced at\r\nhome with the methods of culture now in use.\r\n\r\n[39] No less than 5,877,000 cwts. of beef and mutton, 1,065,470 sheep\r\nand lambs, and 415,565 pieces of cattle were imported in 1895. In\r\n1910 the first of these figures rose to 13,690,000 cwts. Altogether,\r\nit is calculated (_Statesman’s Year-book_, 1912) that, in 1910,\r\n21 lb. of imported beef, 13½ lb. of imported mutton, and 7 lb. of\r\nother sorts of meat, per head of population, were retained for home\r\nconsumption; in addition to 11 lb. of butter, 262 lb. of wheat, 25\r\nlb. of flour, and 20 lb. of rice and rice-flour, imported.\r\n\r\n[40] Agricultural population (farmers and labourers) in England and\r\nWales: 2,100,000 in 1861; 1,383,000 in 1884; 1,311,720 in 1891;\r\n1,152,500 (including fishing population) in 1901.\r\n\r\n[41] Round the small hamlet where I stayed for two summers, there\r\nwere: One farm, 370 acres, four labourers and two boys; another,\r\nabout 300 acres, two men and two boys; a third, 800 acres, five men\r\nonly and probably as many boys. In truth, the problem of cultivating\r\nthe land with the least number of men has been solved in this spot\r\nby not cultivating at all as much as two-thirds of it. Since these\r\nlines were written, in 1890, a movement in favour of intensive\r\nmarket-gardening has begun in this country, and I read in November,\r\n1909, that they were selling at the Covent Garden market asparagus\r\nthat had been grown in South Devon in November. They begin also to\r\ngrow early potatoes in Cornwall and Devon. Formerly, nobody thought\r\nof utilising this rich soil and warm climate for growing early\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\n[42] _Land Problems and National Welfare_, London, 1911.\r\n\r\n[43] _Rural England_, two big volumes, London, 1902.\r\n\r\n[44] See H. Rider Haggard’s _Rural Denmark and its Lessons_, London,\r\n1911, pp. 188-212.\r\n\r\n[45] The _Rothamstead Experiments_, 1888, by Professor W. Fream, p.\r\n35 _seq._ It is well worth noting that Mr. Hall, who was the head\r\nof Rothamstead for many years, maintained from his own experience\r\nthat growing wheat in England is more profitable than rearing live\r\nstock. The same opinion was often expressed by the experts whose\r\ntestimonies are reproduced by Rider Haggard. In many places of his\r\n_Rural England_ one finds also a mention of high wheat crops, up to\r\nfifty-six bushels per acre, obtained in many places in this country.\r\n\r\n[46] The figures which I take for these calculations are given in\r\n_Agricultural Returns of the Board of Agriculture and Agricultural\r\nStatistics for 1911_, vol xlvi., pt. 1. They are as follows for the\r\nyear 1910:--\r\n\r\n                                           Acres.\r\n  Total area (Great Britain)             56,803,000\r\n  Uncultivable area                      24,657,070\r\n                                        (23,680,000 in 1895)\r\n  Cultivable area                        32,145,930\r\n  Out of it, under the plough            14,668,890\r\n  Out of it, under permanent pasture     17,477,040\r\n\r\n(During the last ten years, since the census of 1901, the cultivable\r\narea decreased by 323,000 acres, while the urban area increased by\r\n166,710 acres, thus reaching now 4,015,700 acres. Since 1901, 942,000\r\nacres were withdrawn from the plough, 661,000 acres in England,\r\n158,000 in Wales, and 123,000 in Scotland.)\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the area which is actually under the plough\r\nbetween the various crops varies considerably from year to year.\r\nTaking 1910 (an average year) we have the following:--\r\n\r\n                                           Acres.\r\n  Corn crops                             7,045,530\r\n  Clover and mature grasses              4,157,040\r\n  Green crops and orchards               2,994,890\r\n  Hops                                      32,890\r\n  Small fruit                               84,310\r\n  Flax                                         230\r\n  Bare fallow, etc.                        354,000\r\n  Total under culture (including that\r\n    part of permanent pasture which\r\n    gives hay)                          14,668,890\r\n                         (In 1901       15,610,890)\r\n                         (In 1895       16,166,950)\r\n\r\nOut of the 7,045,530 acres given to corn crops, 1,808,850 acres were\r\nunder wheat (nearly 200,000 acres less than in 1899 and 100,000 acres\r\nless than in 1911), 1,728,680 acres under barley (only 1,597,930 in\r\n1911), 3,020,970 acres under oats, about 300,000 under beans, and\r\nabout 52,000 acres under rye and buckwheat. From 540,000 to 570,000\r\nacres were given to potatoes. The area under clover and sown grasses\r\nis steadily declining since 1898, when it was 4,911,000 acres.\r\n\r\n[47] Only from each 52 acres, out of 308 acres, hay is obtained. The\r\nremainder are grazing grounds.\r\n\r\n[48] That is, thirty to thirty-three bushels on the average; forty\r\nbushels in good farms, and fifty in the best. The area under\r\nwheat was 16,700,000 acres in 1910, all chief corn crops covering\r\n33,947,000 acres; the cultivated area is 90,300,000 acres, and\r\nthe aggregate superficies of France, 130,800,000 acres.

The exports from Algeria are not taken in the above figures.\r\n\r\n[50] Each 1,000 acres of French territory are disposed of as follows:\r\n379 acres are under woods and coppices (176), buildings, communal\r\ngrazing grounds, mountains, etc., and 621 acres are considered as\r\n“cultivable.” Out of the latter, 130 are under meadows, now irrigated\r\nto a great extent, 257 acres under cereals (124 under wheat, and 26\r\nunder wheat mixed with rye), 33 under vineyards, 83 under orchards,\r\ngreen crops, and various industrial cultures, and the remainder is\r\nchiefly under permanent pasture or bare fallow. As to cattle, we\r\nfind in Great Britain, in 1910, which was an average year, 7,037,330\r\nhead of cattle (including in that number about 1,400,000 calves\r\nunder one year), which makes _twenty-two head_ per each 100 acres\r\nof the cultivable area, and 27,103,000 sheep--that is, _eighty-four\r\nsheep_ per each 100 acres of the same area. In France we find, in\r\nthe same year, 14,297,570 cattle (_nineteen_ head per each 100 acres\r\nof cultivable area), and only 17,357,640 sheep (_twenty-one_ sheep\r\nper 100 acres of the same). In other words, the proportion of horned\r\ncattle is nearly the same in both countries (twenty-two head and\r\nnineteen head per 100 acres), a considerable difference appearing in\r\nfavour of this country only as to the number of sheep (eighty-four\r\nas against twenty-one). The heavy imports of hay, oil-cake, oats,\r\netc., into this country must, however, not be forgotten, because,\r\nfor each head of cattle which lives on imported food, eight sheep\r\ncan be grazed, or be fed with home-grown fodder. As to horses, both\r\ncountries stand on nearly the same footing.\r\n\r\n[51] Out of each 1000 acres of territory, 673 are cultivated, and\r\n327 are left as uncultivable, and part of them are now used for\r\nafforestation. Out of the 673 cultivated acres, 273 are given to\r\ncereals, out of which 61 are under pure wheat, 114 under _méteil_ (a\r\nmixture of ⅔ of wheat and ⅓ of rye) and pure rye, and 98 under other\r\ncereals; 18 to potatoes, 45 to roots and fodder, and 281 to various\r\nindustrial cultures (beet for sugar, oleaginous grains, etc.); 27 are\r\nunder gardens, kitchen gardens and parks, 177 under woods, and 57 are\r\ncultivated periodically. On the other hand, each 65 acres out of 1000\r\ngive catch-crops of carrots, mangolds, etc.\r\n\r\n[52] _Annuaire Statistique de la Belgique pour_ 1910, Bruxelles,\r\n1911. In Mr. Seebohm Rowntree’s admirable work, _Land and Labour:\r\nLessons from Belgium_, published 1910 (London, Macmillan), the reader\r\nwill find all concerning Belgian agriculture dealt with in detail on\r\nthe basis of the author’s personal scrupulous inquiries on the spot,\r\nand all available statistical information.\r\n\r\n[53] _Land and Labour: Lessons from Belgium_, pp. 178, 179.\r\n\r\n[54] Taking all horses, cattle and sheep in both countries, and\r\nreckoning eight sheep as equivalent to one head of horned cattle, we\r\nfind that Belgium has _twenty-four_ cattle units and horses upon each\r\n100 acres of territory, as against _twenty_ same units and horses in\r\nGreat Britain. If we take cattle alone, the disproportion is much\r\ngreater, as we find _thirty-six_ cattle units on each 100 acres of\r\ncultivable area, as against _nineteen_ in Great Britain. The annual\r\nvalue of animal produce in Belgium is estimated by the _Annuaire\r\nStatistique de la Belgique_ (1910, p. 302) at £66,040,000, including\r\nmilk (£4,000,000), poultry (£1,600,000), and eggs (£1,400,000).\r\n\r\n[55] I take these lines from a letter which the Rural Office of the\r\nBelgian Ministry of Agriculture had been kind enough to write to me\r\non January 28, 1910, in reply to some questions which I had addressed\r\nto that Office in order to explain the striking oscillations of the\r\nBelgian exports between the years 1870 and 1880. A Belgian friend,\r\nhaving kindly taken new information upon this point, had the same\r\nopinion confirmed from another official source.\r\n\r\n[56] If we take the figures of imports and exports, which I also\r\nowe to the Belgian Rural Office, we find that the _net_ imports\r\nof wheat, rye, and wheat mixed with rye (_méteil_) reached 3,011\r\nmillion lb. in 1907 (3,374 million in 1910), which would give 429 lb.\r\n_per capita_ for a population of 7,000,000 inhabitants. But if this\r\namount be added to the local production of the same cereals, which\r\nreached the same year 2,426 million lb., we arrive at the figure of\r\n776 lb. per head of population. But such a figure is much too high,\r\nbecause the annual _per capita_ consumption _of both the winter\r\nand the spring cereals_ is generally estimated to be 502 lb. There\r\nmust be, therefore, either an error in the weight of the imports,\r\nwhich is improbable, or the figures of re-exported cereals are not\r\ncomplete. Let me add that in France the average annual consumption\r\n_per capita_ of _all_ cereals, including oats, has been in the\r\ncourse of twenty-nine years (1880-1908) 525 lb., which confirms the\r\nabove-mentioned figure. And in France people eat as much bread as in\r\nBelgium.\r\n\r\n[57] See Appendix K.\r\n\r\n[58] Assuming that 9,000 lb. of dry hay are necessary for keeping one\r\nhead of horned cattle every year, the following figures (taken from\r\nToubeau’s _Répartition métrique des impôts_) will show what we obtain\r\nnow under usual and under intensive culture:--\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------+--------------+-------------+----------+\r\n  |                       |              |             |Number of |\r\n  |                       |Crop per acre.|Equivalent in|cattle fed|\r\n  |                       |    Eng. lb.  |   dry hay.  |from each |\r\n  |                       |              |   Eng. lb.  |100 acres.|\r\n  +-----------------------+--------------+-------------+----------+\r\n  | Pasture               |      --      |     1,200   |     13   |\r\n  | Unirrigated meadows   |      --      |     2,400   |     26   |\r\n  | Clover, cut twice     |      --      |     4,800   |     52   |\r\n  | Swedish turnips       |    38,500    |    10,000   |    108   |\r\n  | Rye-grass             |    64,000    |    18,000   |    180   |\r\n  | Beet, high farming    |    64,000    |    21,000   |    210   |\r\n  | Indian corn, ensilage |   120,000    |    30,000   |    330   |\r\n  +-----------------------+--------------+-------------+----------+\r\n\r\n[59] I saw thermosiphons used by the market-gardeners at Worthing.\r\nThey said that they found them quite satisfactory. As to the cost\r\nof heating the soil, let me mention the experiments of H. Mehner,\r\ndescribed in _Gartenflora_, fascicules 16 and 17 of the year\r\n1906. He considers the cost quite small, in comparison with the\r\nincreased value of the crops. With £100 per _Morgen_, spent for the\r\ninstallation, and £10 every spring for heating, the author estimates\r\nthe increase in the value of crops (earlier vegetables) at £100 every\r\nyear. (Report to the German _Landwirthschafts Gesellschaft_, 1906.)\r\n\r\n[60] “Portable soil” is not the latest departure in agriculture. The\r\nlast one is the watering of the soil with special liquids containing\r\nspecial microbes. It is a fact that chemical manures, without organic\r\nmanure, seldom prove to be sufficient. On the other hand, it was\r\ndiscovered lately that certain microbes in the soil are a necessary\r\ncondition for the growth of plants. Hence the idea of _sowing_ the\r\nbeneficent microbes, which rapidly develop in the soil and fertilise\r\nit. We certainly shall soon hear more of this new method, which is\r\nexperimented upon on a large scale in Germany, in order to transform\r\npeat-bogs and heavy soils into rich meadows and fields.\r\n\r\n[61] Ponce, _La culture maraîchère_, 1869; Gressent, _Le potager\r\nmoderne_, 7th edition in 1886; Courtois-Gérard, _Manuel pratique\r\nde culture maraîchère_, 1863; L. G. Gillekens, _Cours pratique\r\nde culture maraîchère_, Bruxelles, 1895; Vilmorin, _Le bon\r\njardinier_ (almanac). The general reader who cares to know about\r\nthe productivity of the soil will find plenty of examples, well\r\nclassified, in the most interesting work _La Répartition métrique des\r\nimpôts_, by A. Toubeau, 2 vols., 1880. I do not quote many excellent\r\nEnglish manuals, but I must remark that the market-gardening culture\r\nin this country has also obtained results very highly prized by the\r\nContinental gardeners, and that the chief reproach to be addressed\r\nto it is its relatively small extension. French market-gardening\r\nhaving been lately introduced into England, several manuals have been\r\npublished for that purpose. The little work, _French Gardening_, by\r\nThomas Smith, London (Utopia Press), 1909, deserves special mention,\r\nas it contains the results of one year’s observation of the work\r\nof a French gardener, specially invited to England by Mr. Joseph\r\nFels, and gives (with illustrations) a mass of practical indications\r\nand numerical data as to the cost and the value of the produce.\r\nA subsequent work of the same author, _The Profitable Culture of\r\nVegetables for Market Gardeners, Small Holders, and Others_, London\r\n(Longmans, Green), 1911, deals in detail with the ordinary culture of\r\nvegetables and the intensive culture of the French gardeners.\r\n\r\n[62] _Manuel pratique de culture maraîchère_, by Courtois-Gérard, 4th\r\nedit., 1868.\r\n\r\n[63] Already it is partly removed in France and Belgium, owing to the\r\npublic laboratories where analyses of seeds and manure are made free.\r\nThe falsifications discovered by these laboratories exceed all that\r\ncould have been imagined. Manures, containing only one-fifth part of\r\nthe nutritious elements they were supposed to contain, were found to\r\nbe quite common; while manures containing injurious matters, and no\r\nnutritious parts whatever, were not unfrequently supplied by firms of\r\n“respectable” repute. With seeds, things stand even worse. Samples\r\nof grass seeds which contained 20 per cent. of injurious grasses, or\r\n20 per cent. of grains of sand, so coloured as to deceive the buyer,\r\nor even 10 per cent. of a deadly poisonous grass, passed through the\r\nGhent laboratory.\r\n\r\n[64] During the winter of 1890 a friend of mine, who lived in a\r\nLondon suburb, used to get his butter from Bavaria _per parcel post_.\r\nIt cost him 10s. the eleven pounds in Bavaria, parcel post inclusive\r\n(2s. 2d.), 6d. for the money order, and 2½d. the letter; total, less\r\nthan 11s. Butter of an inferior quality (out of comparison), with 10\r\nto 15 per cent. of water inclusive, was sold in London at 1s. 6d. the\r\nlb. at the same time.\r\n\r\n[65] The data for the calculation of the cost of production of wheat\r\nin this country are those given by the _Mark Lane Express_; they\r\nwill be found in a digestible form in an article on wheat-growing in\r\nthe _Quarterly Review_ for April, 1887, and in W. E. Bear’s book,\r\n_The British Farmer and his Competitors_, London (Cassell), 1888.\r\nAlthough they are a little above the average, the crop taken for\r\nthe calculations is also above the average. A similar inquiry has\r\nbeen made on a large scale by the Russian Provincial Assemblies,\r\nand the whole was summed up in an elaborate paper, in the _Vyestnik\r\nPromyshlennosti_, No. 49, 1887. To compare the paper kopecks with\r\npence I took the rouble at 63/100 of its nominal value: such was its\r\naverage quotation during the year 1886. I took 475 English lb. in the\r\nquarter of wheat.\r\n\r\n[66] The rents have declined since 1887, but the prices of wheat also\r\nwent down. It must not be forgotten that as the best acres only are\r\nselected for wheat-growing, the rent for each acre upon which wheat\r\nis grown must be taken higher than the average rent per acre in a\r\nfarm of from 200 to 300 acres.\r\n\r\n[67] L. de Lavergne pointed out as far back as fifty years ago that\r\nthe States were at that time the chief importers of guano. Already in\r\n1854 they imported it almost to the same amount as this country, and\r\nthey had, moreover, sixty-two manufactories of guano which supplied\r\nit to the amount of sixteen times the imports. Compare also Ronna’s\r\n_L’agriculture aux Etats Unis_, 1881; Lecouteux, _Le blé_; and J. R.\r\nDodge’s _Annual Report of the American Department of Agriculture_ for\r\n1885 and 1886. Schaeffle’s work was also summed up in Schmoller’s\r\n_Jahrbuch_.\r\n\r\n[68] See also J. R. Dodge’s _Farm and Factory_, New York, 1884.\r\n\r\n[69] Some additional information on this subject will be found in the\r\narticles of mine: “Some Resources of Canada,” and “Recent Science,”\r\nin the _Nineteenth Century_, January, 1898, and October, 1897. I see\r\nfrom the _Experimented Farms’ Reports_ for 1909 that on the average\r\n38,000 samples of seeds are sent in this way to the farmers every\r\nyear; in 1909 more than 38,000 farmers united in experiments as to\r\nthe relative merits of the different sorts of wheat, oats, and barley\r\nunder trial. I think that my friend, Dr. William Saunders, is quite\r\nright in saying that this system of supplying a great number of\r\nfarmers with small quantities of choice seeds has contributed notably\r\nto increase the yield of corn in Canada.\r\n\r\n[70] _L’Horticulture dans les cinq Parties du Monde._ Paris, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE POSSIBILITIES OF AGRICULTURE--(_continued_).\r\n\r\n  The doctrine of Malthus--Progress in wheat-growing--East\r\n  Flanders--Channel Islands--Potato crops, past and\r\n  present--Irrigation--Major Hallet’s experiments--Planted wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew books have exercised so pernicious an influence upon the general\r\ndevelopment of economic thought as Malthus’s _Essay on the Principle\r\nof Population_ exercised for three consecutive generations. It\r\nappeared at the right time, like all books which have had any\r\ninfluence at all, and it summed up ideas already current in the\r\nminds of the wealth-possessing minority. It was precisely when the\r\nideas of equality and liberty, awakened by the French and American\r\nrevolutions, were still permeating the minds of the poor, while the\r\nricher classes had become tired of their amateur excursions into the\r\nsame domains, that Malthus came to assert, in reply to Godwin, that\r\nno equality is possible; that the poverty of the many is not due to\r\ninstitutions, but is a natural _law_. Population, he wrote, grows too\r\nrapidly and the new-comers find no room at the feast of nature; and\r\nthat law cannot be altered by any change of institutions. He thus\r\ngave to the rich a kind of scientific argument against the ideas of\r\nequality; and we know that though all dominion is based upon force,\r\nforce itself begins to totter as soon as it is no longer supported by\r\na firm belief in its own rightfulness. As to the poorer classes--who\r\nalways feel the influence of ideas circulating at a given time\r\namid the wealthier classes--it deprived them of the very hope of\r\nimprovement; it made them sceptical as to the promises of the social\r\nreformers; and to this day the most advanced reformers entertain\r\ndoubts as to the possibility of satisfying the needs of all, in case\r\nthere should be a claim for their satisfaction, and a temporary\r\nwelfare of the labourers resulted in a sudden increase of population.\r\n\r\nScience, down to the present day, remains permeated with Malthus’s\r\nteachings. Political economy continues to base its reasoning upon\r\na tacit admission of the impossibility of rapidly increasing the\r\nproductive powers of a nation, and of thus giving satisfaction to\r\nall wants. This postulate stands, undiscussed, in the background\r\nof whatever political economy, classical or socialist, has to say\r\nabout exchange-value, wages, sale of labour force, rent, exchange,\r\nand consumption. Political economy never rises above the hypothesis\r\nof a _limited and insufficient supply of the necessaries of life_;\r\nit takes it for granted. And all theories connected with political\r\neconomy retain the same erroneous principle. Nearly all socialists,\r\ntoo, admit the postulate. Nay, even in biology (so deeply interwoven\r\nnow with sociology) we have recently seen the theory of variability\r\nof species borrowing a quite unexpected support from its having\r\nbeen connected by Darwin and Wallace with Malthus’s fundamental\r\nidea, that the natural resources must inevitably fail to supply the\r\nmeans of existence for the rapidly multiplying animals and plants.\r\nIn short, we may say that the theory of Malthus, by shaping into a\r\npseudo-scientific form the secret desires of the wealth-possessing\r\nclasses, became the foundation of a whole system of practical\r\nphilosophy, which permeates the minds of both the educated and\r\nuneducated, and reacts (as practical philosophy always does) upon the\r\ntheoretical philosophy of our century.\r\n\r\nTrue, the formidable growth of the productive powers of man in the\r\nindustrial field, since he tamed steam and electricity, has somewhat\r\nshaken Malthus’s doctrine. Industrial wealth _has_ grown at a rate\r\nwhich no possible increase of population could attain, and it _can_\r\ngrow with still greater speed. But agriculture is still considered\r\na stronghold of the Malthusian pseudo-philosophy. The recent\r\nachievements of agriculture and horticulture are not sufficiently\r\nwell known; and while our gardeners defy climate and latitude,\r\nacclimatise sub-tropical plants, raise several crops a year instead\r\nof one, and themselves make the soil they want for each special\r\nculture, the economists nevertheless continue saying that the surface\r\nof the soil is limited, and still more its productive powers; they\r\nstill maintain that a population which should double each thirty\r\nyears would soon be confronted by a lack of the necessaries of life!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few data to illustrate what _can_ be obtained from the soil were\r\ngiven in the preceding chapter. But the deeper one goes into the\r\nsubject, the more new and striking data does he discover, and the\r\nmore Malthus’s fears appear groundless.\r\n\r\nTo begin with an instance taken from culture in the open\r\nfield--namely, that of wheat--we come upon the following interesting\r\nfact. While we are so often told that wheat-growing does not pay,\r\nand England consequently reduces from year to year the area of its\r\nwheat fields, the French peasants steadily increase the area under\r\nwheat, and the greatest increase is due to those peasant families\r\nwhich themselves cultivate the land they own. In the course of the\r\nnineteenth century they have nearly doubled the area under wheat, as\r\nwell as the returns from each acre, so as to increase almost fourfold\r\nthe amount of wheat grown in France.[71]\r\n\r\nAt the same time the population has only increased by 41 per cent.,\r\nso that the ratio of increase of the wheat crop has been six\r\ntimes greater than the ratio of increase of population, although\r\nagriculture has been hampered all the time by a series of serious\r\nobstacles--taxation, military service, poverty of the peasantry, and\r\neven, up to 1884, a severe prohibition of all sorts of association\r\namong the peasants.[72] It must also be remarked that during\r\nthe same hundred years, and even within the last fifty years,\r\nmarket-gardening, fruit-culture and culture for industrial purposes\r\nhave immensely developed in France; so that there would be no\r\nexaggeration in saying that the French obtain now from their soil at\r\nleast six or seven times more than they obtained a hundred years ago.\r\nThe “means of existence” drawn from the soil have thus grown about\r\nfifteen times quicker than the population.\r\n\r\nBut the ratio of progress in agriculture is still better seen from\r\nthe rise of the standard of requirement as regards cultivation of\r\nland. Some thirty years ago the French considered a crop very good\r\nwhen it yielded twenty-two bushels to the acre; but with the same\r\nsoil the present requirement is at least thirty-three bushels,\r\nwhile in the best soils the crop is good only when it yields from\r\nforty-three to forty-eight bushels, and occasionally the produce\r\nis as much as fifty-five bushels to the acre.[73] There are whole\r\ncountries--Hesse, for example--which are satisfied only when the\r\n_average_ crop attains thirty-seven bushels, or Denmark, where the\r\naverage crop (1908-1910) is forty-one bushels per acre (forty-four\r\nbushels in 1910).[74] As to the experimental farms of Central France,\r\nthey produce from year to year, over large areas, forty-one bushels\r\nto the acre; and a number of farms in Northern France regularly\r\nyield, year after year, from fifty-five to sixty-eight bushels to the\r\nacre. Occasionally even so much as eighty bushels have been obtained\r\nupon limited areas under special care.[75] In fact, Prof. Grandeau\r\nconsiders it proved that by combining a series of such operations\r\nas the selection of seeds, sowing in rows, and proper manuring, the\r\ncrops can be largely increased over the best present average, while\r\nthe cost of production can be reduced by 50 per cent. by the use of\r\ninexpensive machinery; to say nothing of costly machines, like the\r\nsteam digger, or the pulverisers which make the soil required for\r\neach special culture. They are now occasionally resorted to here and\r\nthere, and they surely will come into general use as soon as humanity\r\nfeels the need of largely increasing its agricultural produce.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a considerable progress has already been realised in\r\nFrench agriculture by labour-saving machinery during the last\r\ntwenty-five years; but there still remains an immense field for\r\nfurther improvement. Thus, in 1908, France had already in use 25,000\r\nharvesting machines and 1,200 binders as against 180 only of the\r\nformer and sixty of the second, which were used in 1882; but it is\r\ncalculated that no less than 375,000 more harvesting machines and\r\n300,000 mowing machines are required to satisfy the needs of French\r\nagriculture. The same must be said as regards the use of artificial\r\nmanure, irrigation, pumping machinery, and so on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we bear in mind the very unfavourable conditions in which\r\nagriculture stands now all over the world, we must not expect to find\r\nconsiderable progress in its methods realised over wide regions; we\r\nmust be satisfied with noting the advance accomplished in separate,\r\nespecially favoured spots, where, for one cause or another, the\r\ntribute levied upon the agriculturist has not been so heavy as to\r\nstop all possibility of progress.\r\n\r\nOne such example may be seen in the district of Saffelare in East\r\nFlanders. Thirty years ago, on a territory of 37,000 acres, all\r\ntaken, a population of 30,000 inhabitants, all peasants, not only\r\nused to find its food, but managed, moreover, to keep no less than\r\n10,720 horned cattle, 3,800 sheep, 1,815 horses and 6,550 swine, to\r\ngrow flax, and to export various agricultural produce.[76] And during\r\nthe last thirty years it has continued steadily to increase its\r\nexports of agricultural produce.\r\n\r\nAnother illustration of this sort may be taken from the Channel\r\nIslands, whose inhabitants have happily not known the blessings of\r\nRoman law and landlordism, as they still live under the common law\r\nof Normandy. The small island of Jersey, eight miles long and less\r\nthan six miles wide, still remains a land of open-field culture;\r\nbut, although it comprises only 28,707 acres, rocks included, it\r\nnourishes a population of about two inhabitants to each acre, or\r\n1,300 inhabitants to the square mile, and there is not one writer\r\non agriculture who, after having paid a visit to this island, did\r\nnot praise the well-being of the Jersey peasants and the admirable\r\nresults which they obtain in their small farms of from five to twenty\r\nacres--very often less than five acres--by means of a rational and\r\nintensive culture.\r\n\r\nMost of my readers will probably be astonished to learn that the soil\r\nof Jersey, which consists of decomposed granite, with no organic\r\nmatter in it, is not at all of astonishing fertility, and that its\r\nclimate, though more sunny than the climate of these isles, offers\r\nmany drawbacks on account of the small amount of sun-heat during the\r\nsummer and of the cold winds in spring. But so it is in reality, and\r\nat the beginning of the nineteenth century the inhabitants of Jersey\r\nlived chiefly on imported food. (See Appendix L.) The successes\r\naccomplished lately in Jersey are entirely due to the amount of\r\nlabour which a dense population is putting in the land; to a system\r\nof land-tenure, land-transference and inheritance very different from\r\nthose which prevail elsewhere; to freedom from State taxation; and\r\nto the fact that communal institutions have been maintained, down to\r\nquite a recent period, while a number of communal habits and customs\r\nof mutual support, derived therefrom, are alive to the present time.\r\nAs to the fertility of the soil, it is made partly by the sea-weeds\r\ngathered free on the sea-coast, but chiefly by artificial manure\r\nfabricated at Blaydon-on-Tyne, out of all sorts of refuse--inclusive\r\nof bones shipped from Plevna and mummies of cats shipped from Egypt.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that for the last thirty years the Jersey peasants\r\nand farmers have been growing early potatoes on a great scale, and\r\nthat in this line they have attained most satisfactory results. Their\r\nchief aim being to have the potatoes out as early as possible, when\r\nthey fetch at the Jersey Weigh-Bridge as much as £17 and £20 the ton,\r\nthe digging out of potatoes begins, in the best sheltered places, as\r\nearly as the first days of May, or even at the end of April. Quite\r\na system of potato-culture, beginning with the selection of tubers,\r\nthe arrangements for making them germinate, the selection of properly\r\nsheltered and well situated plots of ground, the choice of proper\r\nmanure, and ending with the box in which the potatoes germinate and\r\nwhich has so many other useful applications,--quite a system of\r\nculture has been worked out in the island for that purpose by the\r\ncollective intelligence of the peasants.[77]\r\n\r\nIn the last weeks of May and in June, when the export is at its\r\nheight, quite a fleet of steamers runs between the small island\r\nof Jersey and various ports of England and Scotland. Every day\r\neight to ten steamers enter the harbour of St. Hélier, and in\r\ntwenty-four hours they are loaded with potatoes and steer for\r\nLondon, Southampton, Liverpool, Newcastle, and Scotland. From 50,000\r\nto 60,000 tons of potatoes, valued at from £260,000 to £500,000,\r\naccording to the year, are thus exported every summer; and, if the\r\nlocal consumption be taken into account, we have at least 60,000 to\r\n70,000 tons that are obtained, although no more than from 6,500 to\r\n7,500 acres are given to all potato crops, early and late--early\r\npotatoes, as is well known, never giving as heavy crops as the later\r\nones. Ten to eleven tons per acre is thus the average, while in this\r\ncountry the average is only six tons per acre.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the potatoes are out, the second crop of mangold or of\r\n“three months’ wheat” (a special variety of rapidly growing wheat)\r\nis sown. Not one day is lost in putting it in. The potato-field may\r\nconsist of one or two acres only, but as soon as one-fourth part of\r\nit is cleared of the potatoes it is sown with the second crop. One\r\nmay thus see a small field divided into four plots, three of which\r\nare sown with wheat at five or six days’ distance from each other,\r\nwhile on the fourth plot the potatoes are being dug out.\r\n\r\nThe admirable condition of the meadows and the grazing land in the\r\nChannel Islands has often been described, and although the aggregate\r\narea which is given in Jersey to green crops, grasses under rotation,\r\nand permanent pasture--both for hay and grazing--is less than 11,000\r\nacres, they keep in Jersey over 12,300 head of cattle and over 2,300\r\nhorses solely used for agriculture and breeding.\r\n\r\nMoreover, about 100 bulls and 1,600 cows and heifers are exported\r\nevery year,[78] so that by this time, as was remarked in an American\r\npaper, there are more Jersey cows in America than in Jersey Island.\r\nJersey milk and butter have a wide renown, as also the pears which\r\nare grown in the open air, but each of which is protected on the tree\r\nby a separate cap, and still more the fruit and vegetables which are\r\ngrown in the hothouses. In a word, it will suffice to say that on the\r\nwhole they obtain agricultural produce to the value of £50 to each\r\nacre of the aggregate surface of the island.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFifty pounds’ worth of agricultural produce from each acre of\r\nthe land is sufficiently good. But the more we study the modern\r\nachievements of agriculture, the more we see that the limits\r\nof productivity of the soil are not attained, even in Jersey.\r\nNew horizons are continually unveiled. For the last fifty years\r\nscience--especially chemistry--and mechanical skill have been\r\nwidening and extending the industrial powers of man upon organic\r\nand inorganic dead matter. Prodigies have been achieved in that\r\ndirection. Now comes the turn of similar achievements with living\r\nplants. Human skill in the treatment of living matter, and\r\nscience--in its branch dealing with living organisms--step in with\r\nthe intention of doing for the art of food-growing what mechanical\r\nand chemical skill have done in the art of fashioning and shaping\r\nmetals, wood and the dead fibres of plants. Almost every year brings\r\nsome new, often unexpected improvement in the art of agriculture,\r\nwhich for so many centuries had been dormant.\r\n\r\nWe just saw that while the average potato crop in the country is six\r\ntons per acre, in Jersey it is nearly twice as big. But Mr. Knight,\r\nwhose name is well known to every horticulturist in this country, has\r\nonce dug out of his fields no less than 1,284 bushels of potatoes, or\r\nthirty-four tons and nine cwts. in weight, on one single acre; and\r\nat a recent competition in Minnesota 1,120 bushels, or thirty tons,\r\ncould be ascertained as having been grown on one acre.\r\n\r\nThese are undoubtedly extraordinary crops, but quite recently the\r\nFrench Professor Aimé Girard undertook a series of experiments in\r\norder to find out the best conditions for growing potatoes in his\r\ncountry.[79] He did not care for show-crops obtained by means of\r\nextravagant manuring, but carefully studied all conditions: the best\r\nvariety, the depth of tilling and planting, the distance between the\r\nplants. Then he entered into correspondence with some 350 growers\r\nin different parts of France, advised them by letters, and finally\r\ninduced them to experiment. Strictly following his instructions,\r\nseveral of his correspondents made experiments on a small scale, and\r\nthey obtained--instead of the three tons which they were accustomed\r\nto grow--such crops as would correspond to twenty and thirty-six tons\r\nto the acre. Moreover, ninety growers experimented on fields more\r\nthan one-quarter of an acre in size, and more than twenty growers\r\nmade their experiments on larger areas of from three to twenty-eight\r\nacres. The result was that _none of them obtained less than twelve\r\ntons_ to the acre, while some obtained twenty tons, and the average\r\nwas, for the 110 growers, fourteen and a half tons per acre.\r\n\r\nHowever, industry requires still heavier crops. Potatoes are largely\r\nused in Germany and Belgium for distilleries; consequently, the\r\ndistillery owners try to obtain the greatest possible amounts of\r\nstarch from the acre. Extensive experiments have lately been made for\r\nthat purpose in Germany, and the crops were: Nine tons per acre for\r\nthe poor sorts, fourteen tons for the better ones, and thirty-two and\r\nfour-tenths tons for the best varieties of potatoes.\r\n\r\nThree tons to the acre and more than thirty tons to the acre are thus\r\nthe ascertained limits; and one necessarily asks oneself: Which of\r\nthe two requires _less labour_ in tilling, planting, cultivating and\r\ndigging, and less expenditure in manure--thirty tons grown on ten\r\nacres, or the same thirty tons grown on one acre or two? If labour\r\nis of no consideration, while every penny spent in seeds and manure\r\nis of great importance, as is unhappily very often the case with the\r\npeasant--he will perforce choose the first method. But is it the most\r\neconomic?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgain, I just mentioned that in the Saffelare district and Jersey\r\nthey succeed in keeping one head of horned cattle to each acre of\r\ngreen crops, meadows and pasture land, while elsewhere two or three\r\nacres are required for the same purpose. But better results still can\r\nbe obtained by means of irrigation, either with sewage or even with\r\npure water. In England, farmers are contented with one and a half and\r\ntwo tons of hay per acre, and in the part of Flanders just mentioned,\r\ntwo and a half tons of hay to the acre are considered a fair crop.\r\nBut on the irrigated fields of the Vosges, the Vaucluse, etc., in\r\nFrance, six tons of dry hay become the rule, even upon ungrateful\r\nsoil; and this means considerably more than the annual food of one\r\nmilch cow (which can be taken at a little less than five tons) grown\r\non each acre. All taken, the results of irrigation have proved so\r\nsatisfactory in France that during the years 1862-1882 no less than\r\n1,355,000 acres of meadows have been irrigated,[80] which means that\r\nthe annual meat-food of at least 1,500,000 full-grown persons, or\r\nmore, has been added to the yearly income of the country; home-grown,\r\nnot imported. In fact, in the valley of the Seine, the value of the\r\nland was doubled by irrigation; in the Saône valley it was increased\r\nfive times, and ten times in certain _landes_ of Brittany.[81]\r\n\r\nThe example of the Campine district, in Belgium, is classical. It was\r\na most unproductive territory--mere sand from the sea, blown into\r\nirregular mounds which were only kept together by the roots of the\r\nheath; the acre of it used to be sold, not rented, at from 5s. to 7s.\r\n(15 to 20 francs per hectare). But now it is capable, thanks to the\r\nwork of the Flemish peasants and to irrigation, to produce the food\r\nof one milch cow per acre--the dung of the cattle being utilised for\r\nfurther improvements.\r\n\r\nThe irrigated meadows round Milan are another well-known example.\r\nNearly 22,000 acres are irrigated there with water derived from\r\nthe sewers of the city, and they yield crops of from eight to ten\r\ntons of hay as a rule; occasionally some separate meadows will\r\nyield the fabulous amount--fabulous to-day, but no longer fabulous\r\nto-morrow--of eighteen tons of hay per acre, that is, the food of\r\nnearly four cows to the acre, and nine times the yield of good\r\nmeadows in this country.[82] However, English readers need not go\r\nso far as Milan for ascertaining the results of irrigation by sewer\r\nwater. They have several such examples in this country, in the\r\nexperiments of Sir John Lawes, and especially at Craigentinny, near\r\nEdinburgh, where, to use Ronna’s words, “the growth of rye grass is\r\nso activated that it attains its full development in one year instead\r\nof in three to four years. Sown in August, it gives a first crop in\r\nautumn, and then, beginning with next spring, a crop of four tons\r\nto the acre is taken every month; which represents in the fourteen\r\nmonths more than fifty-six tons (of green fodder) to the acre.”[83]\r\nAt Lodge Farm they grow forty to fifty-two tons of green crops per\r\nacre, after the cereals, without new manuring. At Aldershot they\r\nobtain excellent potato crops; and at Romford (Breton’s Farm) Colonel\r\nHope obtained, in 1871-1872, quite extravagant crops of various roots\r\nand potatoes.[84]\r\n\r\nIt can thus be said that while at the present time we give two and\r\nthree acres for keeping one head of horned cattle, and only in a few\r\nplaces one head of cattle is kept on each acre given to green crops,\r\nmeadows and pasture, man has already in irrigation (which very soon\r\nrepays when it is properly made) the possibility of keeping twice\r\nand even thrice as many head of cattle to the acre over parts of his\r\nterritory. Moreover, the very heavy crops of roots which are now\r\nobtained (seventy-five to 110 tons of beetroot to the acre are not\r\ninfrequent) give another powerful means for increasing the number of\r\ncattle without taking the land from what is now given to the culture\r\nof cereals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother new departure in agriculture, which is full of promises and\r\nprobably will upset many a current notion, must be mentioned in this\r\nplace. I mean the almost horticultural treatment of our corn crops,\r\nwhich is widely practised in the far East, and begins to claim our\r\nattention in Western Europe as well.\r\n\r\nAt the First International Exhibition, in 1851, Major Hallett, of\r\nManor House, Brighton, had a series of very interesting exhibits\r\nwhich he described as “pedigree cereals.” By picking out the best\r\nplants of his fields, and by submitting their descendants to a\r\ncareful selection from year to year, he had succeeded in producing\r\nnew prolific varieties of wheat and barley. Each grain of these\r\ncereals, instead of giving only two to four ears, as is the usual\r\naverage in a corn-field, gave ten to twenty-five ears, and the best\r\nears, instead of carrying from sixty to sixty-eight grains, had an\r\naverage of nearly twice that number of grains.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain such prolific varieties Major Hallett naturally\r\ncould not sow his picked grains broadcast; he planted them, each\r\nseparately, in rows, at distances of from ten to twelve inches from\r\neach other. In this way he found that each grain, having full room\r\nfor what is called “tillering” (_tallage_ in French[85]), would\r\nproduce ten, fifteen, twenty-five, and even up to ninety and 100\r\nears, as the case may be; and as each ear would contain from 60\r\nto 120 grains, crops of 500 to 2,500 grains, or more, could be\r\nobtained from each separately planted grain. He even exhibited at\r\nthe Exeter meeting of the British Association three plants of wheat,\r\nbarley, and oats, each from a single grain, which had the following\r\nnumber of stems: wheat, ninety-four stems; barley, 110 stems; oats,\r\neighty-seven stems.[86] The barley plant which had 110 stems thus\r\ngave something like 5,000 to 6,000 grains from one single grain. A\r\ncareful drawing of that wonderful stubble was made by Major Hallett’s\r\ndaughter and circulated with his pamphlets.[87] Again, in 1876, a\r\nwheat plant, with “105 heads growing on one root, on which more than\r\n8,000 grains were growing at once,” was exhibited at the Maidstone\r\nFarmers’ Club.[88]\r\n\r\nTwo different processes were thus involved in Hallett’s experiments:\r\na process of selection, in order to create new varieties of cereals,\r\nsimilar to the breeding of new varieties of cattle; and a method\r\nof immensely increasing the crop from each grain and from a given\r\narea, by planting each seed separately and wide apart, so as to have\r\nroom for the full development of the young plant, which is usually\r\nsuffocated by its neighbours in our corn-fields.[89]\r\n\r\nThe double character of Major Hallett’s method--the breeding of\r\n_new prolific varieties_, and the method of culture by _planting\r\nthe seeds wide apart_--seems, however, so far as I am entitled to\r\njudge, to have been overlooked until quite lately. The method was\r\nmostly judged upon its results; and when a farmer had experimented\r\nupon “Hallett’s Wheat,” and found out that it was late in ripening\r\nin his own locality, or gave a less perfect grain than some other\r\nvariety, he usually did not care more about the method.[90] However,\r\nMajor Hallett’s successes or non-successes in breeding such or\r\nsuch varieties are quite distinct from what is to be said about the\r\nmethod itself of selection, or the method of planting wheat seeds\r\nwide apart. Varieties which were bred, and which I saw grown still\r\nat Manor Farm, on the windy downs of Brighton may be, or may not be,\r\nsuitable to this or that locality. Latest physiological researches\r\ngive such an importance to evaporation in the bringing of cereals\r\nto maturity that where evaporation is not so rapid as it is on the\r\nBrighton Downs, other varieties must be resorted to and bred on\r\npurpose.[91] I should also suggest that quite different wheats than\r\nthe English ought to be experimented upon for obtaining prolific\r\nvarieties; namely, the quickly-growing Norwegian wheat, the Jersey\r\n“three months’ wheat,” or even Yakutsk barley, which matures with an\r\nastonishing rapidity. And now that horticulturists, so experienced in\r\n“breeding” and “crossing” as Vilmorin, Carter, Sherif, W. Saunders\r\nin Canada and many others are, have taken the matter in hand, we\r\nmay feel sure that future progress will be made. But breeding is\r\none thing; and the planting wide apart of seeds of an appropriate\r\nvariety of wheat is quite another thing.\r\n\r\nThis last method was lately experimented upon by M. Grandeau,\r\nDirector of the Station Agronomique de l’Est, and by M. Florimond\r\nDessprèz at the experimental station of Capelle; and in both cases\r\nthe results were most remarkable. At this last station a method which\r\nis in use in France for the choice of seeds was applied. Already\r\nnow some French farmers go over their wheat fields before the crop\r\nbegins, choose the soundest plants which bear two or three equally\r\nstrong stems, adorned with long ears, well stocked with grains, and\r\ntake these ears. Then they crop off with scissors the top and the\r\nbottom of each ear and keep its middle part only, which contains\r\nthe biggest seeds. With a dozen quarts of such selected grains\r\nthey obtain next year the required quantity of seeds of a superior\r\nquality.[92]\r\n\r\nThe same was done by M. Dessprèz. Then each seed was planted\r\nseparately, eight inches apart in a row, by means of a specially\r\ndevised tool, similar to the _rayonneur_ which is used for planting\r\npotatoes; and the rows, also eight inches apart, were alternately\r\ngiven to the big and to the smaller seeds. One-fourth part of an\r\nacre having been planted in this way, with seeds obtained from both\r\nearly and late ears, crops corresponding to 83·8 bushels per acre\r\nfor the first series, and 90·4 bushels for the second series, were\r\nobtained; even the small grains gave in this experiment as much as\r\n70·2 and 62 bushels respectively.[93]\r\n\r\nThe crop was thus more than doubled by the choice of seeds and by\r\nplanting them separately eight inches apart. It corresponded in\r\nDessprèz’s experiments to _600 grains obtained on the average from\r\neach grain sown_; and one-tenth or one-eleventh part of an acre was\r\nsufficient in such case to grow the eight and a half bushels of wheat\r\nwhich are required on the average for the annual bread food per head\r\nof a population which would chiefly live on bread.\r\n\r\nProf. Grandeau, Director of the French Station Agronomique de l’Est,\r\nhas also made, since 1886, experiments on Major Hallett’s method,\r\nand he obtained similar results. “In a proper soil,” he wrote, “one\r\nsingle grain of wheat can give as much as fifty stems (and ears), and\r\neven more, and thus cover a circle thirteen inches in diameter.”[94]\r\nBut as he seems to know how difficult it often is to convince people\r\nof the plainest facts, he published the photographs of separate wheat\r\nplants grown in different soils, differently manured, including pure\r\nriver sand enriched by manure.[95] He concluded that under proper\r\ntreatment 2,000 and even 4,000 grains could be easily obtained from\r\neach planted grain. The seedlings, growing from grains planted ten\r\ninches apart, cover the whole space, and the experimental plot\r\ntakes the aspect of an excellent cornfield, as may be seen from a\r\nphotograph given by Grandeau in his _Etudes agronomiques_.[96]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Wheat Plants. _a_, Has given 17 ears from\r\neach planted grain. Soil manured with chemical manure only. _b_, Has\r\ngiven 25 ears from each planted grain. Soil manured with both stable\r\nand chemical manure.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Squares at Professor Grandeau’s experimental\r\nstation, planted with grains of wheat, in three different soils: _a_,\r\npure sand; _b_ and _c_, manured arable soil; each grain 12 inches\r\napart.]\r\n\r\nIn fact, the eight and a half bushels required for one man’s annual\r\nfood were actually grown at the Tomblaine station on a surface of\r\n2,250 square feet, or forty-seven feet square--that is, on very\r\nnearly one-twentieth part of an acre.\r\n\r\nAgain, we may thus say, that where we require now three acres, one\r\nacre would be sufficient for growing the same amount of food, if\r\nplanting wide apart were resorted to. And there is, surely, no more\r\nobjection to planting wheat than there is to sowing in rows, which\r\nis now in general use, although at the time when the system was\r\nfirst introduced, _in lieu_ of the formerly usual mode of sowing\r\nbroadcast, it certainly was met with great distrust. While the\r\nChinese and the Japanese used for centuries to sow wheat in rows,\r\nby means of a bamboo tube adapted to the plough, European writers\r\nobjected, of course, to this method under the pretext that it would\r\nrequire too much labour. It is the same now with planting each seed\r\napart. Professional writers sneer at it, although all the rice that\r\nis grown in Japan is planted _and even replanted_. Everyone, however,\r\nwho will think of the labour which must be spent for ploughing,\r\nharrowing, fencing, and keeping free of weeds three acres instead of\r\none, and who will calculate the corresponding expenditure in manure,\r\nwill surely admit that all advantages are in favour of the one acre\r\nas against the three acres, to say nothing of the possibilities of\r\nirrigation, or of the planting machine-tool, which will be devised\r\nas soon as there is a demand for it.[97]\r\n\r\nMore than that, there is full reason to believe that even this\r\nmethod is liable to further improvement by means of _replanting_.\r\nCereals in such cases would be treated as vegetables are treated in\r\nhorticulture. Such is, at least, the idea which began to germinate\r\nsince the methods of cereal culture that are resorted to in China and\r\nJapan became better known in Europe. (See Appendix O.)\r\n\r\nThe future--a near future, I hope--will show what practical\r\nimportance such a method of treating cereals may have. But we need\r\nnot speculate about that future. We have already, in the facts\r\nmentioned in this chapter, an experimental basis for quite a number\r\nof means of improving our present methods of culture and of largely\r\nincreasing the crops. It is evident that in a book which is not\r\nintended to be a manual of agriculture, all I can do is to give only\r\na few hints to set people thinking for themselves upon this subject.\r\nBut the little that has been said is sufficient to show that we have\r\nno right to complain of over-population, and no need to fear it in\r\nthe future. Our means of obtaining from the soil whatever we want,\r\nunder _any_ climate and upon _any_ soil, have lately been improved\r\nat such a rate that we cannot foresee yet what is the limit of\r\nproductivity of a few acres of land. The limit vanishes in proportion\r\nto our better study of the subject, and every year makes it vanish\r\nfurther and further from our sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[71] The researches of Tisserand may be summed up as follows:\r\n\r\n  +---------+----------+-----------+------------+-------------+\r\n  |         |Population|Acres under|Average crop|Wheat crop in|\r\n  |  Year.  |    in    |   wheat.  | in bushels |   bushels.  |\r\n  |         | millions.|           |  per acre. |             |\r\n  +---------+----------+-----------+------------+-------------+\r\n  | 1789    |   27·0   |  9,884,000|      9     |  87,980,000 |\r\n  | 1831-41 |   33·4   | 13,224,000|     15     | 194,225,000 |\r\n  | 1882-88 |   38·2   | 17,198,000|     18     | 311,619,000 |\r\n  +---------+----------+-----------+------------+-------------+\r\n\r\n[72] In a recent evaluation, M.

For\r\npotatoes, the increase is still greater: while 198,800,000 cwt. of\r\npotatoes were grown in 1882, the crop of 1909 was already 328,300,000\r\ncwt., the average yield of the acre growing from 148 cwt. in 1882 to\r\n212 cwt. in 1909.\r\n\r\n[73] Grandeau, _Etudes agronomiques_, 2^e série. Paris, 1888.\r\n\r\n[74] Although 36 per cent. of the cultivable area is under cereals,\r\nthere were in Denmark, in 1910, 2,253,980 head of cattle, as against\r\n1,238,900 in 1871, and 1,470,100 in 1882.\r\n\r\n[75] Risler, _Physiologie et Culture du Blé_. Paris, 1886. Taking the\r\nwhole of the wheat crop in France, we see that the following progress\r\nhas been realised. In 1872-1881 the average crop was 16½ bushels per\r\nacre. In 1882-1890 it attained 17-9/10 bushels per acre. Increase by\r\n14 per cent. in ten years (Prof. C. V. Garola, _Les Céréales_, p. 70\r\n_seq._).\r\n\r\n[76] O. de Kerchove de Denterghen, _La petite Culture des Flandres\r\nbelges_, Gand, 1878.\r\n\r\n[77] One could not insist too much on the collective character of\r\nthe development of that branch of husbandry. In many places of the\r\nSouth coast of England early potatoes can also be grown--to say\r\nnothing of Cornwall and South Devon, where potatoes are obtained by\r\nseparate labourers in small quantities as early as they are obtained\r\nin Jersey. But so long as this culture remains the work of isolated\r\ngrowers, its results must necessarily be inferior to those which the\r\nJersey peasants obtain through their collective experience. For the\r\ntechnical details concerning potato-culture in Jersey, see a paper\r\nby a Jersey grower in the _Journal of Horticulture_, 22nd and 29th\r\nMay, 1890. Considerable progress has been made lately in Cornwall,\r\nespecially in the neighbourhood of Penzance, in the development of\r\npotato-growing and intensive market-gardening, and one may hope that\r\nthe successes of these growers will incite others to imitate their\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n[78] See Appendix L.\r\n\r\n[79] See the _Annales agronomiques_ for 1892 and 1893; also _Journal\r\ndes Economistes_, février, 1893, p. 215.\r\n\r\n[80] Barral in _Journal d’Agriculture pratique_, 2 février, 1889;\r\nBoitel, _Herbages et Prairies naturelles_, Paris, 1887.\r\n\r\n[81] The increase of the crops due to irrigation is most instructive.\r\nIn the most unproductive Sologne, irrigation has increased the hay\r\ncrop from two tons per hectare (two and a half acres) to eight tons;\r\nin the Vendée, from four tons of bad hay to ten tons of excellent\r\nhay. In the Ain, M. Puris, having spent 19,000 francs for irrigating\r\nninety-two and a half hectares (about £2 10s. per acre), obtained an\r\nincrease of 207 tons of excellent hay. In the south of France, a net\r\nincrease of over four bushels of wheat per acre is easily obtained\r\nby irrigation; while for market gardening the increase was found\r\nto attain £30 to £40 per acre. (See H. Sagnier, “Irrigation,” in\r\nBarral’s _Dictionnaire d’Agriculture_, vol. iii., p. 339.) I hardly\r\nneed mention the striking results obtained lately by irrigation in\r\nEgypt and on the dry plateaus of the United States.\r\n\r\n[82] _Dictionnaire d’Agriculture_, same article. See also Appendix M.\r\n\r\n[83] Ronna, _Les Irrigations_, vol. iii., p. 67. Paris, 1890.\r\n\r\n[84] Prof. Ronna gives the following figures of crops per acre:\r\nTwenty-eight tons of potatoes, sixteen tons of mangolds, 105 tons of\r\nbeet, 110 tons of carrots, nine to twenty tons of various cabbage,\r\nand so on.--Most remarkable results seem also to have been obtained\r\nby M. Goppart, by growing green fodder for ensilage. See his work,\r\n_Manuel de la Culture des Maïs et autres Fourrages verts_, Paris,\r\n1877.\r\n\r\n[85] “Shortly after the plant appears above ground it commences to\r\nthrow out new and distinct stems, upon the first appearance of which\r\na correspondent root-bud is developed for its support; and while\r\nthe new stems grow out flat over the surface of the soil, their\r\nrespective roots assume a corresponding development beneath it. This\r\nprocess, called ‘tillering,’ will continue until the season arrives\r\nfor the stems to assume an upright growth.” The less the roots have\r\nbeen interfered with by overcrowding the better will be the ears\r\n(Major Hallett, “Thin Seeding,” etc.).\r\n\r\n[86] Paper on “Thin Seeding and the Selection of Seed,” read before\r\nthe Midland Farmers’ Club, 4th June, 1874.\r\n\r\n[87] “Pedigree Cereals,” 1889. Paper on “Thin Seeding,” etc., just\r\nmentioned. Abstracts from _The Times_, etc., 1862. Major Hallett\r\ncontributed, moreover, several papers to the _Journal of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society_, and one to _The Nineteenth Century_.\r\n\r\n[88] _Agricultural Gazette_, 3rd January, 1876. Ninety ears, some of\r\nwhich contained as many as 132 grains each, were also obtained in New\r\nZealand.\r\n\r\n[89] It appears from many different experiments (mentioned in Prof.\r\nGarola’s excellent work, _Les Céréales_, Paris, 1892) that when\r\ntested seeds (of which no more than 6 per cent. are lost on sowing)\r\nare sown broadcast, to the amount of 500 seeds per square metre (a\r\nlittle more than one square yard), _only 148 of them give plants_.\r\nEach plant gives in such case from two to four stems and from two to\r\nfour ears; but nearly 360 seeds are entirely lost. When sown in rows,\r\nthe loss is not so great, but it is still considerable.\r\n\r\n[90] See Prof. Garola’s remarks on “Hallett’s Wheat,” which, by the\r\nway, seems to be well known to farmers in France and Germany (_Les\r\nCéréales_, p. 337).\r\n\r\n[91] Besides, Hallett’s wheat must not be sown later than the first\r\nweek of September. Those who may try experiments with planted wheat\r\nmust be especially careful to make the experiments in open fields,\r\nnot in a back garden, and to sow early.\r\n\r\n[92] Upon this method of selecting seeds opinions are, however, at\r\nvariance amongst agriculturists.\r\n\r\n[93] The straw was eighty-three and seventy-seven cwts. per acre in\r\nthe first case; fifty-nine and forty-nine cwts. in the second case\r\n(Garola, _Les Céréales_). In his above-mentioned paper on “Thin\r\nSeeding,” Major Hallett mentions a crop at the rate of 108 bushels to\r\nthe acre, obtained by planting nine inches apart.\r\n\r\n[94] L. Grandeau, _Etudes agronomiques_, 3^e série, 1887-1888, p. 43.\r\nThis series is still continued by one volume every year.\r\n\r\n[95] On one of these photographs one sees that in a soil improved by\r\nchemical manure only, seventeen stems from each grain are obtained;\r\nwith organic manure added to the former, twenty-five stems were\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n[96] Most interesting experiments for obtaining new sorts of wheat,\r\ncombining the qualities of Canadian wheat with those of the best\r\nBritish sorts, are being carried on now at the Cambridge University.\r\nSimilar experiments have been made in Germany by F. von Lochow, at\r\nPetkno, in order to produce new races of rye rich in gluten and\r\nprolific. These last experiments were made on Mr. Hallett’s method,\r\nand the results were satisfactory, as it appears from a report\r\npublished in Fuehling’s _Landwirthschaftliche Zeitung_, Leipzig,\r\nJanuary and February, 1900, pp. 29 and 45.\r\n\r\n[97] See Appendix N.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE POSSIBILITIES OF AGRICULTURE--(_continued_).\r\n\r\n  Extension of market-gardening and fruit growing: in France;\r\n  in the United States--Culture under glass--Kitchen gardens\r\n  under glass--Hothouse culture: in Guernsey and Jersey: in\r\n  Belgium--Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting features of the present evolution\r\nof agriculture is the extension lately taken by intensive\r\nmarket-gardening of the same sort as has been described in the\r\nthird chapter. What formerly was limited to a few hundreds of small\r\ngardens, is now spreading with an astonishing rapidity. In this\r\ncountry the area given to market-gardens, after having more than\r\ndoubled within the years 1879 to 1894, when it attained 88,210 acres,\r\nhas continued steadily to increase.[98] But it is especially in\r\nFrance, Belgium, and America that this branch of culture has lately\r\ntaken a great development. (See Appendix P.)\r\n\r\nAt the present time no less than 1,075,000 acres are given in France\r\nto market-gardening and intensive fruit culture, and a few years ago\r\nit was estimated that the _average_ yield of every acre given to\r\nthese cultures attains £33, 10s.[99] Their character, as well as the\r\namount of skill displayed in, and labour given to, these cultures,\r\nwill best appear from the following illustrations.\r\n\r\nAbout Roscoff, which is a great centre in Brittany for the export to\r\nEngland of such potatoes as will keep till late in summer, and of\r\nall sorts of vegetables, a territory, twenty-six miles in diameter,\r\nis entirely given to these cultures, and the rents attain and exceed\r\n£5 per acre. Nearly 300 steamers call at Roscoff to ship potatoes,\r\nonions and other vegetables to London and different English ports, as\r\nfar north as Newcastle. Moreover, as much as 4,000 tons of vegetables\r\nare sent every year to Paris.[100] And although the Roscoff peninsula\r\nenjoys a specially warm climate, small stone walls are erected\r\neverywhere, and rushes are grown on their tops in order to give still\r\nmore protection and heat to the vegetables.[101] The climate is\r\nimproved as well as the soil.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhoods of Cherbourg it is upon land conquered from\r\nthe sea that the best vegetables are grown--more than 800 acres of\r\nthat land being given to potatoes exported to London; another 500\r\nacres are given to cauliflower; 125 acres to Brussels sprouts; and\r\nso on. Potatoes grown under glass are also sent to the London market\r\nfrom the middle of April, and the total export of vegetables from\r\nCherbourg to England attains 300,000 cwts., while from the small port\r\nof Barfleur another 100,000 cwts. are sent to this country, and about\r\n60,000 cwts. to Paris. Nay, in a quite small commune, Surtainville,\r\nnear Cherbourg, £2,800 are made out of 180 acres of market-gardens,\r\nthree crops being taken every year: cabbage in February, early\r\npotatoes next, and various crops in the autumn--to say nothing of the\r\ncatch crops.\r\n\r\nAt Plougastel one hardly believes that he is in Brittany. Melons used\r\nto be grown at that spot, long since, in the open fields, with glass\r\nframes to protect them from the spring frost, and green peas were\r\ngrown under the protection of rows of furze which sheltered them from\r\nthe northern winds. Now, whole fields are covered with strawberries,\r\nroses, violets, cherries and plums, down to the very sea beach.[102]\r\nEven the _landes_ are reclaimed, and we are told that in five years\r\nor so there will be no more _landes_ in that district (p. 265). Nay,\r\nthe marshes of the Dol--“The Holland of Brittany”--protected from the\r\nsea by a wall (5,050 acres), have been turned into market-gardens,\r\ncovered with cauliflowers, onions, radishes, haricot beans and so on,\r\nthe acre of that land being rented at from £2, 10s. to £4.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhoods of Nantes could also be mentioned. Green peas are\r\ncultivated there on a very large scale. During the months of May and\r\nJune quite an army of working people, especially women and children,\r\nare picking them. The roads leading to the great preserving factories\r\nare covered at certain hours with rows of carts, upon which the\r\npeas and onions are carted one way, while another row of carts are\r\ncarrying the empty pods which are used for manure. For two months the\r\nchildren are missing in the schools; and in the peasant families of\r\nthe neighbourhood, when the question comes about some expenditure to\r\nbe made, the usual saying is, “Wait till the season of the green peas\r\nhas come.”\r\n\r\nAbout Paris no less than 50,000 acres are given to the field culture\r\nof vegetables and 25,000 acres to the forced culture of the same.\r\nSixty years ago the yearly rent paid by market-gardeners attained\r\nalready as much as £18 and £24 per acre, and yet it has been\r\nincreased since, as well as the gross receipts, which were valued by\r\nCourtois Gérard at £240 per acre for the larger market-gardeners,\r\nand twice as much for the smaller ones in which early vegetables are\r\ngrown in frames.\r\n\r\nThe fruit culture in the neighbourhoods of Paris is equally\r\nwonderful. At Montreuil, for instance, 750 acres, belonging to 400\r\ngardeners, are literally covered with stone walls, specially erected\r\nfor growing fruit, and having an aggregate length of 400 miles.\r\nUpon these walls, peach trees, pear trees and vines are spread, and\r\nevery year something like 12,000,000 peaches are gathered, as well\r\nas a considerable amount of the finest pears and grapes. The acre\r\nin such conditions brings in £56. This is how a “warmer climate”\r\nwas made, at a time when the greenhouse was still a costly luxury.\r\nAll taken, 1,250 acres are given to peaches (25,000,000 peaches\r\nevery year) in the close neighbourhood of Paris. Acres and acres\r\nare also covered with pear trees which yield three to five tons of\r\nfruit per acre, such crop being sold at from £50 to £60. Nay, at\r\nAngers, on the Loire, where pears are eight days in advance of the\r\nsuburbs of Paris, Baltet knows an orchard of five acres, covered with\r\npears (pyramid trees), which brings in £400 every year; and at a\r\ndistance of thirty-three miles from Paris one pear plantation brings\r\nin £24 per acre--the cost of package, transport and selling being\r\ndeducted. Likewise, the plantations of plums, of which 80,000 cwts.\r\nare consumed every year at Paris alone, give an annual money income\r\nof from £29 to £48 per acre every year; and yet, pears, plums and\r\ncherries are sold at Paris, fresh and juicy, at such a price that the\r\npoor, too, can eat fresh home-grown fruit.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Anjou one may see how a heavy clay, improved with\r\nsand taken from the Loire and with manure, has been turned, in the\r\nneighbourhoods of Angers, and especially at Saint Laud, into a soil\r\nwhich is rented at from £2, 10s. to £5 the acre, and upon that soil\r\nfruit is grown which a few years ago was exported to America.[103]\r\nAt Bennecour, a quite small village of 850 inhabitants, near Paris,\r\none sees what man can make out of the most unproductive soil. Quite\r\nrecently the steep slopes of its hills were only _mergers_ from which\r\nstone was extracted for the pavements of Paris. Now these slopes\r\nare entirely covered with apricot and cherry trees, black-currant\r\nshrubs, and plantations of asparagus, green peas and the like. In\r\n1881, £5,600 worth of apricots alone was sold out of this village,\r\nand it must be borne in mind that competition is so acute in the\r\nneighbourhoods of Paris that a delay of twenty-four hours in\r\nthe sending of apricots to the market will often mean a loss of\r\n8s.--one-seventh of the sale price on each hundred-weight.[104]\r\n\r\nAt Perpignan, green artichokes--a favourite vegetable in France--are\r\ngrown, from October till June, on an area covering 2,500 acres, and\r\nthe net revenue is estimated at £32 per acre. In Central France,\r\nartichokes are even cultivated in the open fields, and nevertheless\r\nthe crops are valued (by Baltet) at from £48 to £100 per acre. In\r\nthe Loiret, 1,500 gardeners, who occasionally employ 5,000 workmen,\r\nobtain from £400,000 to £480,000 worth of vegetables, and their\r\nyearly expenditure for manure is £60,000. This figure alone is the\r\nbest answer to those who are fond of talking about the extraordinary\r\nfertility of the soil, each time they are told of some success\r\nin agriculture. At Lyons, a population of 430,000 inhabitants is\r\nentirely supplied with vegetables by the local gardeners. The same\r\nis in Amiens, which is another big industrial city. The districts\r\nsurrounding Orléans form another great centre for market-gardening,\r\nand it is especially worthy of notice that the shrubberies of Orléans\r\nsupply even America with large quantities of young trees.[105]\r\n\r\nIt would take, however, a volume to describe the chief centres of\r\nmarket-gardening and fruit-growing in France; and I will mention\r\nonly one region more, where vegetables and fruit-growing go hand in\r\nhand. It lies on the banks of the Rhône, about Vienne, where we find\r\na narrow strip of land, partly composed of granite rocks, which has\r\nnow become a garden of an incredible richness. The origin of that\r\nwealth, we are told by Ardouin Dumazet, dates from some thirty years\r\nago, when the vineyards, ravaged by phylloxera, had to be destroyed\r\nand some new culture had to be found. The village of Ampuis became\r\nthen renowned for its apricots. At the present time, for a full 100\r\nmiles along the Rhône, and in the lateral valleys of the Ardèche and\r\nthe Drôme, the country is an admirable orchard, from which millions’\r\nworth of fruit is exported, and the land attains the selling price\r\nof from £325 to £400 the acre. Small plots of land are continually\r\nreclaimed for culture upon every crag. On both sides of the roads\r\none sees the plantations of apricot and cherry trees, while between\r\nthe rows of trees early beans and peas, strawberries, and all sorts\r\nof early vegetables are grown. In the spring the fine perfume of the\r\napricot trees in bloom floats over the whole valley. Strawberries,\r\ncherries, apricots, peaches and grapes follow each other in rapid\r\nsuccession, and at the same time cartloads of French beans, salads,\r\ncabbages, leeks, and potatoes are sent towards the industrial cities\r\nof the region. It would be impossible to estimate the quantity and\r\nvalue of all that is grown in that region. Suffice it to say that a\r\ntiny commune, Saint Désirat, exported during Ardouin Dumazet’s visit\r\nabout 2,000 cwts. of cherries every day.[106]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe results of this development are simply striking. Thus it appears,\r\nfrom an inquest made in 1906 by the French professors of agriculture,\r\nthat the yearly export of fresh flowers from the _département_ of the\r\nAlpes Maritimes attains as much as £400,000, and that of the flowers\r\nused for perfumes gives from £280,000 to £320,000 in addition to the\r\njust mentioned sum.[107] From the _département_ of the Var, 3,475\r\ntons of flowers, valued from £160,000 to £200,000, were exported in\r\n1902.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI must refer the reader to the work of Charles Baltet if he will\r\nknow more about the extension taken by market-gardening in different\r\ncountries, and will only mention Belgium and America.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe exports of vegetables from Belgium have increased twofold within\r\nthe last twenty years of the nineteenth century, and whole regions,\r\nlike Flanders, claim to be now the market-garden of England, even\r\nseeds of the vegetables preferred in this country being distributed\r\nfree by one horticultural society in order to increase the export.\r\nNot only the best lands are appropriated for that purpose, but even\r\nthe sand deserts of the Ardennes and peat-bogs are turned into rich\r\nmarket-gardens, while large plains (namely at Haeren) are irrigated\r\nfor the same purpose. Scores of schools, experimental farms, and\r\nsmall experimental stations, evening lectures, and so on, are opened\r\nby the communes, the private societies, and the State, in order to\r\npromote horticulture, and hundreds of acres of land are covered with\r\nthousands of greenhouses.\r\n\r\nHere we see one small commune exporting 5,500 tons of potatoes and\r\n£4,000 worth of pears to Stratford and Scotland, and keeping for\r\nthat purpose its own line of steamers. Another commune supplies the\r\nnorth of France and the Rhenish provinces with strawberries, and\r\noccasionally sends some of them to Covent Garden as well. Elsewhere\r\nearly carrots, which are grown amidst flax, barley and white poppies,\r\ngive a considerable addition to the farmer’s income. In another place\r\nwe learn that land is rented at £24 and £27 the acre, not for grapes\r\nor melon-growing but for the modest culture of onions; or that the\r\ngardeners have done away with such a nuisance as natural soil in\r\ntheir frames, and prefer to make their loam out of wood sawings,\r\ntannery refuse and hemp dust, “animalised” by various composts.[108]\r\n\r\nIn short, Belgium, which is one of the chief manufacturing countries\r\nof Europe, is now becoming one of the chief centres of horticulture.\r\n(See Appendix R.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe other country which must especially be recommended to the\r\nattention of horticulturists is America. When we see the mountains\r\nof fruit imported from America we are inclined to think that fruit\r\nin that country grows by itself. “Beautiful climate,” “virgin\r\nsoil,” “immeasurable spaces”--these words continually recur in the\r\npapers. The reality, however, is that horticulture--that is, both\r\nmarket-gardening and fruit culture--has been brought in America to\r\na high degree of perfection. Prof. Baltet, a practical gardener\r\nhimself, originally from the classical _marais_ (market-gardens) of\r\nTroyes, describes the “truck farms” of Norfolk in Virginia as real\r\n“model farms.” A highly complimentary appreciation from the lips of\r\na practical _maraîcher_ who has learned from his infancy that only\r\nin fairyland do the golden apples grow by the fairies’ magic wand.\r\nAs to the perfection to which apple-growing has been brought in\r\nCanada, the aid which the apple-growers receive from the Canadian\r\nexperimental farms, and the means which are resorted to, on a truly\r\nAmerican scale, to spread information amongst the farmers and to\r\nsupply them with new varieties of fruit trees--all this ought to be\r\ncarefully studied in this country, instead of inducing Englishmen to\r\nbelieve that the American supremacy is due to the golden fairies’\r\nhands. If one tenth part of what is done in the States and in Canada\r\nfor favouring agriculture and horticulture were done in this country,\r\nEnglish fruit would not have been so shamefully driven out of the\r\nmarket as it was a few years ago.\r\n\r\nThe extension given to horticulture in America is immense. The “truck\r\nfarms” alone--that is, the farms which work for export by rail or\r\nsteam--covered in the States in 1892 no less than 400,000 acres. At\r\nthe very doors of Chicago one single market-gardening farm covers 500\r\nacres, and out of these, 150 acres are given to cucumbers, 50 acres\r\nto early peas, and so on. During the Chicago Exhibition a special\r\n“strawberry express,” composed of thirty waggons, brought in every\r\nday 324,000 quarts of the freshly gathered fruit, and there are\r\ndays that over 10,000 bushels of strawberries are imported in New\r\nYork--three-fourths of that amount coming from the “truck farms” of\r\nVirginia by steamer.[109]\r\n\r\nThis is what can be achieved by an intelligent combination of\r\nagriculture with industry, and undoubtedly will be applied on a still\r\nlarger scale in the future.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHowever, a further advance is being made in order to emancipate\r\nhorticulture from climate. I mean the glasshouse culture of fruit and\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\nFormerly the greenhouse was the luxury of the rich mansion. It was\r\nkept at a high temperature, and was made use of for growing, under\r\ncold skies, the golden fruit and the bewitching flowers of the South.\r\nNow, and especially since the progress of technics allows of making\r\ncheap glass and of having all the woodwork, sashes and bars of a\r\ngreenhouse made by machinery, the glasshouse becomes appropriated for\r\ngrowing fruit for the million, as well as for the culture of common\r\nvegetables. The aristocratic hothouse, stocked with the rarest fruit\r\ntrees and flowers, remains; nay, it spreads more and more for growing\r\nluxuries which become more and more accessible to the great number.\r\nBut by its side we have the plebeian greenhouse, which is heated for\r\nonly a couple of months in winter and the still more economically\r\nbuilt “cool greenhouse,” which is a simple glass shelter--a big “cool\r\nframe”--and is stuffed with the humble vegetables of the kitchen\r\ngarden: the potatoes, the carrots, the French beans, the peas and the\r\nlike. The heat of the sun, passing through the glass, but prevented\r\nby the same glass from escaping by radiation, is sufficient to keep\r\nit at a very high temperature during spring and early summer. A\r\nnew system of horticulture--the market-garden under glass--is thus\r\nrapidly gaining ground.\r\n\r\nThe greenhouse for commercial purposes is essentially of British,\r\nor perhaps Scottish, origin. Already in 1851, Mr. Th. Rivers had\r\npublished a book, _The Orchard Houses and the Cultivation of Fruit\r\nTrees in Pots under Glass_; and we were told by Mr. D. Thomson, in\r\nthe _Journal of Horticulture_ (31st January, 1889), that nearly fifty\r\nyears ago grapes in February were sold at 25s. the pound by a grower\r\nin the north of England, and that part of them was sent by the buyer\r\nto Paris for Napoleon III.’s table, at 50s. the pound. “Now,” Mr.\r\nThomson added, “they are sold at the tenth or twentieth part of the\r\nabove prices. Cheap coal--cheap grapes; that is the whole secret.”\r\n\r\nLarge vineries and immense establishments for growing flowers under\r\nglass are of an old standing in this country, and new ones are\r\ncontinually built on a grand scale. Entire fields are covered with\r\nglass at Cheshunt, at Broxburn (fifty acres), at Finchley, at Bexley,\r\nat Swanley, at Whetstone, and so on, to say nothing of Scotland.\r\nWorthing is also a well-known centre for growing grapes and tomatoes;\r\nwhile the greenhouses given to flowers and ferns at Upper Edmonton,\r\nat Chelsea, at Orpington, and so on, have a world-wide reputation.\r\nAnd the tendency is, on the one side, to bring grape culture to the\r\nhighest degree of perfection, and, on the other side, to cover acres\r\nand acres with glass for growing tomatoes, French beans and peas,\r\nwhich undoubtedly will soon be followed by the culture of still\r\nplainer vegetables. This movement, as will be seen further on, has\r\nbeen steadily continuing for the last twenty years.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Channel Islands and Belgium still hold the lead in the\r\ndevelopment of glasshouse culture. The glory of Jersey is, of course,\r\nMr. Bashford’s establishment. When I visited it in 1890, it contained\r\n490,000 square feet under glass--that is, nearly thirteen acres--but\r\nseven more acres under glass have been added to it since. A long\r\nrow of glasshouses, interspersed with high chimneys, covers the\r\nground--the largest of the houses being 900 feet long and forty-six\r\nfeet wide; this means that about one acre of land, in one piece, is\r\nunder glass. The whole is built most substantially; granite walls,\r\ngreat height, thick “twenty-seven oz. glass” (of the thickness of\r\nthree pennies),[110] ventilators which open upon a length of 200\r\nand 300 feet by working one single handle; and so on. And yet the\r\nmost luxurious of these greenhouses was said by the owners to have\r\ncost less than 1s. the square foot of glass (13d. the square foot\r\nof ground), while the other houses have cost much less than that.\r\nFrom 5d. to 9d. the square foot of glass[111] is the habitual cost,\r\nwithout the heating apparatus--6d. being a current price for the\r\nordinary glasshouses.\r\n\r\nBut it would be hardly possible to give an idea of all that is grown\r\nin such glasshouses, without producing photographs of their insides.\r\nIn 1890, on the 3rd of May, exquisite grapes began to be cut in\r\nMr. Bashford’s vineries, and the crop was continued till October.\r\nIn other houses, cartloads of peas had already been gathered, and\r\ntomatoes were going to take their place after a thorough cleaning of\r\nthe house. The 20,000 tomato plants, which were going to be planted,\r\nhad to yield no less than eighty tons of excellent fruit (eight to\r\nten pounds per plant). In other houses melons were grown instead\r\nof the tomatoes. Thirty tons of early potatoes, six tons of early\r\npeas, and two tons of early French beans had already been sent away\r\nin April. As to the vineries, they yielded no less than twenty-five\r\ntons of grapes every year. Besides, very many other things were grown\r\nin the open air, or as catch crops, and all that amount of fruit\r\nand vegetables was the result of the labour of thirty-six men and\r\nboys only, under the supervision of one single gardener--the owner\r\nhimself; true that in Jersey, and especially in Guernsey, everyone is\r\na gardener. About 1,000 tons of coke were burnt to heat these houses.\r\nMr. W. Bear, who had visited the same establishment in 1886, was\r\nquite right to say that from these thirteen acres they obtained money\r\nreturns equivalent to what a farmer would obtain from 1,300 acres of\r\nland.\r\n\r\nI hardly need say that Mr. Rider Haggard, who visited Jersey and\r\nGuernsey in 1901, gave of these two islands the same enthusiastic\r\ndescription as his predecessors. “I can only state in conclusion,”\r\nhe wrote, “that for my part, here (in Jersey) as in Guernsey, I was\r\namazed at the prosperity of the place. That so small an area of\r\nland can produce so much wealth is nothing short of astonishing. It\r\nis true, as I have shown, that the inquirer hears some grumblings\r\nand fears for the future; but when on the top of them he sees a\r\nlittle patch of twenty-three and one-third acres of land, such as I\r\nhave instanced, and is informed that quite recently it sold at an\r\nauction for £5,760, to be used, not for building sites but for the\r\ncultivation of potatoes, he is perhaps justified in drawing his own\r\nconclusions.” It need not be added that, like all his predecessors,\r\nMr. Haggard disposes of the legend of extraordinary natural fertility\r\nof the soil, and shows at what a considerable expenditure the heavy\r\ncrops of potatoes are obtained.[112]\r\n\r\nHowever, it is in the small “vineries” that one sees, perhaps,\r\nthe most admirable results. As I walked through such glass-roofed\r\nkitchen gardens, I could not but admire this recent conquest of man.\r\nI saw, for instance, three-fourths of an acre heated for the first\r\nthree months of the year, from which about eight tons of tomatoes\r\nand about 200 lb. of French beans had been taken as a first crop\r\nin April, to be followed by two crops more. In these houses one\r\ngardener was employed with two assistants, a small amount of coke was\r\nconsumed, and there was a gas engine for watering purposes, consuming\r\nonly 13s. worth of gas during the quarter. I saw again, in cool\r\ngreenhouses--simple plank and glass shelters--pea plants covering the\r\nwalls, for the length of one quarter of a mile, which already had\r\nyielded by the end of April 3,200 lb. of exquisite peas and were yet\r\nas full of pods as if not one had been taken off.\r\n\r\nI saw potatoes dug from the soil in a cool greenhouse, in April, to\r\nthe amount of five bushels to the twenty-one feet square. And when\r\nchance brought me, in 1896, in company with a local gardener, to a\r\ntiny, retired “vinery” of a veteran grower, I could see there, and\r\nadmire, what a lover of gardening can obtain from so small a space as\r\nthe two-thirds of an acre. Two small “houses” about forty feet long\r\nand twelve feet wide, and a third--formerly a pigsty, twenty feet\r\nby twelve--contained vine trees which many a professional gardener\r\nwould be happy to have a look at; especially the whilom pigsty,\r\nfitted with “Muscats”! Some grapes (in June) were already in full\r\nbeauty, and one fully understands that the owner could get in 1895,\r\nfrom a local dealer, £4 for three bunches of grapes (one of them\r\nwas a “Colmar,” 13¾ lb. weight). The tomatoes and strawberries in\r\nthe open air, as well as the fruit trees, all on tiny spaces, were\r\nequal to the grapes; and when one is shown on what a space half a ton\r\nof strawberries can be gathered under proper culture, it is hardly\r\nbelievable.\r\n\r\nIt is especially in Guernsey that the simplification of the\r\ngreenhouse must be studied. Every house in the suburbs of St. Peter\r\nhas some sort of greenhouse, big or small. All over the island,\r\nespecially in the north, wherever you look, you see greenhouses.\r\nThey rise amid the fields and from behind the trees; they are piled\r\nupon one another on the steep crags facing the harbour of St.\r\nPeter; and with them a whole generation of practical gardeners has\r\ngrown up. Every farmer is more or less of a gardener, and he gives\r\nfree scope to his inventive powers for devising some cheap type of\r\ngreenhouses. Some of them have almost no front and back walls--the\r\nglass roofs coming low down and the two or three feet of glass in\r\nfront simply reaching the ground; in some houses the lower sheet of\r\nglass was simply plunged into a wooden trough standing on the ground\r\nand filled with sand. Many houses have only two or three planks, laid\r\nhorizontally, instead of the usual stone wall, in the front of the\r\ngreenhouse.\r\n\r\nThe large houses of one big company are built close to each\r\nother, and have no partitions between. But this system cannot be\r\nrecommended. Altogether, when I revisited Guernsey in 1903, I saw\r\nthat the system of greenhouses which prevailed was that of long\r\ntwo-roofed glass “tents,” placed by the side of each other, but\r\nseparated from each other by partitions preventing the circulation of\r\nthe air over the whole block. As to the extensive _cool_ greenhouses\r\non the Grande Maison estate, which are built by a company and are\r\nrented to gardeners for so much the 100 feet, they are simply made of\r\nthin deal board and glass. They are on the “lean to” or “one roof”\r\nsystem, and the back wall, ten feet high, and the two side walls are\r\nin simple grooved boards, standing upright. The whole is supported by\r\nuprights inserted into concrete pillars. They are said to cost not\r\nmore than 5d. the square foot, of glass-covered ground. And yet, even\r\nsuch plain and cheap houses yield excellent results. The potato crop\r\nwhich had been grown in some of them was excellent, as also the green\r\npeas.[113]\r\n\r\nIn Jersey I even saw a row of five houses, the walls of which were\r\nmade of corrugated iron, for the sake of cheapness. Of course, the\r\nowner himself was not over-sanguine about his houses. “They are too\r\ncold in winter and too hot in summer.” But although the five houses\r\ncover only less than one-fifth of an acre, 2,000 lb. of green peas\r\nhad already been sold as a first crop; and, in the first days of\r\nJune, the second crop (about 1,500 plants of tomatoes) was already in\r\ngood progress.\r\n\r\nIt is always difficult, of course, to know what are the money returns\r\nof the growers, first of all because Thorold Rogers’ complaint about\r\nmodern farmers keeping no accounts holds good, even for the best\r\ngardening establishments, and next because when the returns are known\r\nto me in all details, it would not be right for me to publish them.\r\n“Don’t prove too much; beware of the landlord!” a practical gardener\r\nonce wrote to me. Roughly speaking, I can only confirm Mr. Bear’s\r\nestimate to the effect that under proper management even a cool\r\ngreenhouse, which covers 4,050 square feet, can give a gross return\r\nof £180.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the Guernsey and Jersey growers have only three crops\r\nevery year from their greenhouses. They will start, for instance,\r\npotatoes in December. The house will, of course, not be heated,\r\nfires being made only when a sharp frost is expected at night; and\r\nthe potato crop (from eight to ten tons per acre) will be ready\r\nin April or May before the open-air potatoes begin to be dug out.\r\nTomatoes will be planted next and be ready by the end of the summer.\r\nVarious catch crops of peas, radishes, lettuce and other small things\r\nwill be taken in the meantime. Or else the house will be “started”\r\nin November with melons, which will be ready in April. They will\r\nbe followed by tomatoes, either in pots, or trained as vines, and\r\nthe last crop of tomatoes will be in October. Beans may follow and\r\nbe ready for Christmas. I need not say that every grower has his\r\npreference method for utilising his houses, and it entirely depends\r\nupon his skill and watchfulness to have all sorts of small catch\r\ncrops. These last begin to have a greater and greater importance, and\r\none can already foresee that the growers under glass will be forced\r\nto accept the methods of the French _maraîchers_, so as to have five\r\nand six crops every year, so far as it can be done without spoiling\r\nthe present high quality of the produce.\r\n\r\nAll this industry is of a relatively recent origin. One may see it\r\nstill working out its methods. And yet the exports from Guernsey\r\nalone are already represented by quite extraordinary figures. It was\r\nestimated some years ago that they were as follows: Grapes, 502 tons,\r\n£37,500 worth at the average price of 9d. the pound; tomatoes, 1,000\r\ntons, about £30,000; early potatoes (chiefly in the fields), £20,000;\r\nradishes and broccoli, £9,250; cut flowers, £3,000; mushrooms, £200;\r\ntotal, £99,950--to which total the local consumption in the houses\r\nand hotels, which have to feed nearly 30,000 tourists, must be added.\r\nSince then these figures have grown considerably. In June, 1896, I\r\nsaw the Southampton steamers taking every day from 9,000 to 12,000,\r\nand occasionally more, baskets of fruit (grapes, tomatoes, French\r\nbeans and peas), each basket representing from twelve to fourteen\r\npounds of fruit. Taking into account what was sent by other channels,\r\none could say that from 400 to 500 tons of tomatoes, grapes, beans\r\nand peas, worth from £20,000 to £25,000, were exported there every\r\nweek in June.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to Guernsey in 1903, I found that the industry of\r\nfruit-growing under glass had grown immensely since 1896, so that\r\nthe whole system of export had to be reorganised. In 1896 it was\r\nthe tourists’ boats which transported the fruit and vegetables to\r\nSouthampton, and the gardeners paid one shilling for each basket\r\ntaken at Guernsey and delivered at the Covent Garden market. In 1903\r\nthere was already a Guernsey Growers’ Association, which had its own\r\nboats keeping, during the summer, a regular daily service direct from\r\nGuernsey to London. The Association had its own storehouses on the\r\nquay and its own cranes, which lifted immense cubic boxes containing\r\non their shelves twenty or even a hundred baskets, and carrying\r\nthem to the boats. The cost of transport was thus reduced to 4d.\r\nper basket. All this crop is sold every morning at Covent Garden to\r\nthe London dealers and greengrocers. The importance of this export\r\nis seen from the fact that a special steamer has to leave Guernsey\r\nevery morning with its cargo of fruit and vegetables. As to the\r\ntotal exports of fresh flowers, plants and shrubs, various fruit\r\nand vegetables (including £555,275 worth of potatoes), they reached\r\n£1,115,650 in 1910.\r\n\r\nAll this is obtained from an island whose total area, rocks and\r\nbarren hill-tops included, is only 16,000 acres, of which only 9,884\r\nacres are under culture, and 5,189 acres are given to green crops and\r\nmeadows. An island, moreover, on which 1,480 horses, 7,260 head of\r\ncattle and 900 sheep find their existence. How many men’s food is,\r\nthen, grown on these 10,000 acres?\r\n\r\nBelgium has also made, within the last few years, an immense progress\r\nin the same direction. While no more than 250 acres, all taken, were\r\ncovered with glass some thirty years ago, more than 800 acres are\r\nunder glass by this time.[114] In the village of Hoeilaert, which is\r\nperched upon a stony hill, nearly 200 acres are under glass, given up\r\nto grape-growing. One single establishment, Baltet remarks, has 200\r\ngreenhouses and consumes 1,500 tons of coal for the vineries.[115]\r\n“Cheap coal--cheap grapes,” as the editor of the _Journal of\r\nHorticulture_ wrote. Grapes in Brussels are certainly not dearer in\r\nthe beginning of the summer than they are in Switzerland in October.\r\nEven _in March_, Belgian grapes were sold in Covent Garden at from\r\n4d. and 6d. the pound.[116] This price alone shows sufficiently how\r\nsmall are the amounts of labour which are required to grow grapes in\r\nour latitudes with the aid of glass. _It certainly costs less labour\r\nto grow grapes in Belgium than to grow them on the coasts of Lake\r\nLeman._[117]\r\n\r\nI will not conclude this chapter without casting a glance on the\r\nprogress that has been made in this country since the first edition\r\nof this book was published, in 1898, by fruit and flower farming, as\r\nalso by culture under glass, and on the attempts recently made to\r\nintroduce in different parts of England “French Gardening,”--that is,\r\nthe _culture maraîchère_ of the French gardeners.\r\n\r\nThere is not the slightest doubt that fruit-growing has notably\r\nincreased--the area under fruit orchards having grown in Great\r\nBritain from 200,000 acres in 1888 to 250,000 acres in 1908; while\r\nthe area under small fruit (gooseberries, currants, strawberries)\r\nhas grown from 75,000 acres in 1901 to 85,000 in 1908.[118] In fact,\r\nin some counties the acreage has trebled.[119] Large plantations\r\nof fruit have grown lately round London and all the large cities,\r\nand the counties of Kent, Devon, Hereford, Somerset, Worcester and\r\nGloucester have now more than 20,000 acres each under fruit orchards,\r\na great proportion of them being of a recent origin. Not only was\r\nthe area of fruit-growing considerably increased, but, owing to the\r\nexperiments carried on since 1894 at the Woburn Experimental Farm,\r\nwhere different sorts of fruit-trees and small fruit are tested,\r\nnew varieties have been introduced; and the system is spreading of\r\ngrowing fruit trees of the pyramidal or “bush” form (instead of\r\nthe old-fashioned standards)--a step the advantages of which I was\r\nenabled fully to appreciate in 1897 at the Agassiz Experimental Farm\r\nin British Columbia.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the culture of small fruit--gooseberries,\r\nraspberries, currants, and especially strawberries--took an immense\r\ndevelopment. Enormous quantities of strawberries are now grown in\r\nMid and South Kent, where we find the culture of fruit combined with\r\nlarge jam factories. One of such factories is connected with great\r\nfruit farms covering 2,000 acres at Swanley, and its yearly output\r\nattains 3,500 tons of jam, 850 tons of candied peel, and more than\r\n100,000 bottles of bottled fruit. An extensive horticulture has also\r\ndeveloped of late in Cambridgeshire, wherefrom fruit is sent partly\r\nfresh to London and Manchester, and partly is transformed on the\r\nspot in the jam factory at Histon. No less than 250 workpeople were\r\nemployed at this factory at the time of Rider Haggard’s visit in\r\n1900, and no less than 7,600 tons were exported; the most interesting\r\nresult of this industry combined with agriculture being that quite\r\na number of small farmers, renting from three to twenty acres each,\r\nhave grown round the jam factory. “Altogether,” Mr. Haggard wrote,\r\n“fruit and flower culture has increased enormously; so that, in\r\n1901, from 4,000 to 5,000 acres in the neighbourhood of Wisbech\r\nwere devoted to this trade. Plums, apples, pears, small fruit, as\r\nalso cauliflowers, asparagus, rhubarb, narcissi, pansies and other\r\nflowers were grown here on a grand scale, and as much as from 130\r\nto 140 tons of gooseberries and from 60 to 70 tons of strawberries\r\nwere despatched from Wisbech in one single day.” “The result of this\r\nindustry,” Mr. Haggard adds, “was that the population of Wisbech and\r\nthe number of houses in this little town have rapidly increased; the\r\nland has increased in value considerably in the past twenty years,\r\nand as much as £200 an acre had been given for choice land-holdings\r\nsuitable for fruit culture.” (_Rural England_, vol. ii., pp. 52,\r\n54, 55.) In other words, the net result of the labour spent by the\r\nfarmers and of the intelligent enterprise of the industrials was,\r\nas everywhere, immensely to increase the value of the land for\r\nthe benefit of the landlords. Mr. Haggard’s conclusion is worth\r\nmentioning, as he writes as follows: “Broadly, however, I may say\r\nthat where the farms are large and corn is chiefly grown, there is\r\nlittle or no prosperity, while where they are small and assisted by\r\npastures or fruit culture, both owners and tenants are doing fairly\r\nwell.”[120] A recognition well worth mentioning, as it comes from an\r\nexplorer who took at the outset of his inquest a most pessimistic\r\nview on unprotected agriculture.\r\n\r\nI also ought to mention Essex, where fruit-growing has taken of\r\nlate a notable development, and Hampshire, where the acreage under\r\nfruit has trebled since 1880, according to the testimony of the\r\nauthor of the already mentioned _Britannica_ article. The same\r\nmust be said of Worcestershire, and especially of the Evesham\r\ndistrict. This last is a most instructive region. Owing to certain\r\npeculiarities of its soil, which render it very profitable for\r\ngrowing asparagus and plum trees, and partly owing to the maintenance\r\nin this region of the old “Evesham custom” (according to which\r\nfrom times immemorial the ingoing tenant had to pay the outgoing\r\ntenant, not the landlord, for the agricultural improvements)--a\r\ncustom maintained till nowadays[121]--the small-holdings system and\r\nthe culture of vegetables and fruit have developed to a remarkable\r\nextent. The result is that out of a rural area of 10,000 acres,\r\n7,000 have already been taken in small holdings of under fifty acres\r\neach, and the demand for them, far from being satisfied, is still on\r\nthe increase, so that in 1911 there were still nearly four hundred\r\nfarmers waiting for 2,000 acres. A new town has grown at Evesham,\r\nits population of 8,340 persons being almost entirely composed of\r\ngardeners and gardeners’ labourers; its markets, held twice a week,\r\nremind one of markets in the south of France; and the export traffic\r\non the railways radiating from that little town is as lively as if it\r\nwere a busy industrial spot.\r\n\r\nOne cannot read the pages given by Mr. Rider Haggard to the Bewdley\r\nand Evesham districts without being impressed by what can be obtained\r\nfrom the soil in England, and by what has to be done by the nation\r\nand all those who care for its well-being in obtaining from the soil\r\nwhat it is ready to give, if only _labour_ be applied to it.\r\n\r\nIn the Bewdley district we see very well how the efforts of a\r\nSmall Holdings Society are giving the opportunity to a number\r\nof small farmers to transform an indifferent and sometimes very\r\npoor or stony land into a fertile soil which yields rich crops of\r\nfruit, and upon which the keeping of milch-cows is combined with\r\nfruit-growing. We see also how in the big farms, as well as in the\r\nsmall ones, fruit-growing is carried on with knowledge and care--and,\r\nconsequently, with a substantial profit for both the community and\r\nthe farmers--which makes the author exclaim: “How different in most\r\ncounties! In Norfolk, for instance (and I may add in Devonshire), the\r\nordinary farm orchard is stocked as a rule with faggot-headed trees\r\npruned only by the wind. Even the dead wood is left uncut; yet it is\r\ncommon to hear farmers complain of the quality of the fruit, and\r\nthat it will not pay to grow” (vol. i., p. 338).\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Catshill, Mr. Haggard gives also a very interesting\r\ninstance of how a colony of people called “Nailers,” who lived\r\nformerly by making nails by hand, and compelled to abandon this trade\r\nwhen machine-made nails were introduced, took to agriculture, and how\r\nthey succeed with it. Some intelligent people having bought a farm of\r\n140 acres and divided it into small farms, from 2½ to 8 acres, these\r\nsmall holdings were offered to the nailers; and at the time of Mr.\r\nHaggard’s visit “every instalment which was due had been paid up.” No\r\nable-bodied man out of them has gone on to the rates.\r\n\r\nBut the vale of Evesham is still more interesting. Suffice it to say,\r\nthat while in most rural parishes the population is decreasing, _it\r\nrose in the six parishes of the Evesham Union_ from 7,327 to 9,012 in\r\nthe ten years, 1891 to 1901.\r\n\r\nAlthough the soil of this district offers nothing extraordinary,\r\nand the conditions of sale are as bad as anywhere, owing to the\r\nimportance acquired by the middlemen, we see that an extremely\r\nimportant industry of fruit-growing has developed; so important that\r\nin the year 1900 about 20,000 tons of fruit and vegetables were sent\r\nfrom the Evesham stations, in addition to large quantities exported\r\nfrom the small stations within a radius of ten miles round Evesham\r\n(vol. i., p. 350). The soil, of course, is improved by digging into\r\nit large quantities of all sorts of manure--soot, fish guano, leather\r\ndust for cabbage (chamois dust being the best), and so on--and the\r\nmost profitable sorts of fruit-trees and vegetables are continually\r\ntested; all this being, of course, not the work of some scientist or\r\nof one single man, but the product of the collective experience of\r\nthe district.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought, however, that fruit-growing has been\r\noverdone. On the contrary, the imports of fruit into the United\r\nKingdom, both for food and for jam-making, continue to be enormous,\r\nand to increase every year. Suffice it to say, that this country\r\nimports every year about £1,000,000 of tomatoes and £2,000,000 of\r\napples, half a million worth of pears, nearly £730,000 worth of\r\ngrapes--giving thus a total of £4,200,000 worth of all fruit. And\r\nat the same time we learn that immense quantities of land go every\r\nyear out of culture, to be transformed into game reserves for rich\r\nEnglishmen and foreigners.\r\n\r\nFinally, I also ought to mention the recent development of fruit\r\nculture near the Broads of Norfolk, and especially in Ireland; but\r\nthe examples just given will do to show what is obtained from the\r\nland in England where no obstacle is laid to the development of\r\nhorticulture, and what amount of food can be obtained in the climate\r\nand from the soil of this country whenever it is properly cultivated.\r\nLet me only add that a similar development of fruit culture has\r\ntaken place within the last thirty years everywhere in the civilised\r\ncountries; and that in France, in Belgium, and in Germany the\r\nextension taken by horticulture during the last twenty or thirty\r\nyears has been much greater than in this country.[122]\r\n\r\nAs regards _market-gardening_, it has undoubtedly made remarkable\r\nprogress in the United Kingdom within recent years. However, accurate\r\ndata are failing, and those who have travelled over this country with\r\nthe special purpose of studying its agriculture have not yet given\r\nsufficient attention to the recent developments of market-gardening;\r\nbut it is quite certain that within the last five-and-twenty years\r\nit has taken a great development, especially in Ireland, but also in\r\nseveral parts of England, Scotland, and Wales.\r\n\r\nSuch are, for instance, the neighbourhoods of Penzance, in\r\nCornwall; those of St. Neots, in Huntingdonshire; Scotter, in\r\nLincolnshire, where the agricultural depression--we are told by Mr.\r\nRider Haggard--was not so badly felt as elsewhere on account of\r\nmarket-gardening; Benington, in the same county, where the soil is\r\na rich loam with silty subsoil, and where all sorts of vegetables,\r\npotatoes, and flower-bulbs are grown on a large scale, together with\r\nwheat.[123] Orpington is a well-known centre for market-gardening, as\r\nwell as for fruit-growing, and in this district culture under glass\r\nhas also taken lately some extension.\r\n\r\nThere are many other interesting centres of market-gardening,\r\nespecially in the neighbourhoods of all large cities, but I will\r\nmention only one more--namely, Potton, in Huntingdonshire. It is--we\r\nare told by Mr. Haggard--“a stronghold of small cultivators who\r\ngrow vegetables upon holdings of land varying in size from one up\r\nto twenty acres, or even more.” It has thus become an important\r\ncentre for market-gardening, “120 trucks of produce leaving Potton\r\ndaily during the season for London, in addition to fifty trucks\r\nwhich pass over the Great Northern line from Sandy station, together\r\nwith much more from sidings and other stations.” This is the more\r\ninteresting as within a short distance from this animated centre\r\n“thousands of acres are quite or very nearly derelict, and the\r\nfarmhouses, buildings, and cottages are slowly rotting down.” The\r\nworst is that “all this land was cultivated, and grew crops up to the\r\n’eighties.”[124]\r\n\r\nAnother oasis of market-gardening is offered by the county of\r\nBedfordshire. “Being a county of natural small-holdings, carved out\r\nbefore the passing of the 1907 Act,” it is rapidly becoming--we are\r\ntold by Mr. F. E. Green--“a county of market-gardens.” The fertility\r\nof its soil, the fact that it can easily be worked at any time of the\r\nyear, and that a race of skilled gardeners has developed there long\r\nsince, have contributed to that growth; but, of course, the whole\r\nis hampered by the heavy rents, which have grown up to £4 an acre\r\nfor the sites near the station, where manure is received in large\r\nquantities from London.[125] Happily enough, the Bedfordshire County\r\nCouncil has been eager to acquire land for small holdings, and, after\r\nhaving spent £40,000 in the acquisition of land, they have, up to\r\n30th June, 1911, provided one-third of the applicants with 2,759\r\nacres--the total demand, by a thousand applicants, having already\r\nattained 12,350 acres.\r\n\r\nAnd yet all this progress still appears insignificant by the\r\nside of the demand for vegetables which grows every year (and\r\nnecessarily _must_ grow, as is seen by comparing the low consumption\r\nof vegetables in this country with the consumption of home-grown\r\nvegetables in Belgium, indicated by Mr. Rowntree in his _Lessons\r\nfrom Belgium_). The result is a steadily increasing importation\r\nof vegetables to this country, which has attained now more than\r\n£8,000,000.[126]\r\n\r\nA branch of horticulture which has increased enormously since the\r\nfirst edition of this book was published, is the _growing of fruit\r\nand vegetables in greenhouses_, in the same way as it is done in the\r\nChannel Islands. All round London--we are told by Mr. John Weathers\r\nin the last edition of the _Encyclopædia Britannica_--the hothouse\r\nculture has taken a great development, and, in fact, along the\r\nrailways which radiate from London in all directions the glass-houses\r\nhave already become a familiar feature of the landscape. Immense\r\nquantities of grapes, tomatoes, figs, and of all sorts of early\r\nvegetables are grown at Worthing, where eighty-two acres are covered\r\nnow with glass-houses, as also in the parish of Cheshunt, in Herts,\r\nwhere the area under hothouses is already 130 acres; while a careful\r\nestimate put in 1908 the area of individual hothouses in England at\r\nabout 1,200 acres (_Encyclopædia Britannica_, vol. xi., p. 266). The\r\nelements of this culture having been developed by the experience\r\nof the Channel Islands growers, and by the wide extension which\r\nhothouses for the growing of flowers had taken long since in this\r\ncountry, it may be concluded from the various evidence we have at\r\nhand that on the whole this sort of culture is finding its reward,\r\nand is now firmly established.\r\n\r\nThe same, however, cannot yet be said of the _culture maraîchère_\r\nof the French market-gardeners which is being introduced now into\r\nthis country. Many attempts have been made in this direction in\r\ndifferent parts of the country with varied degrees of success; but\r\nlittle or nothing is known about the results. An attempt on a large\r\nscale was made, as is known, by some Evesham gardeners. Having read\r\nabout this sort of culture in France, and the wonderful results\r\nobtained by it, some of the Evesham gardeners went to Paris with\r\nthe intention of learning that culture from the Paris _maraîchers_.\r\nFinding that impossible, they invited a French gardener to Evesham,\r\ngave him three-quarters of an acre, and, after he had brought from\r\nhis Paris _marais_ his glass-bells, frames and lights, and, above\r\nall, his knowledge, he began gardening under the eyes of his Evesham\r\ncolleagues. “Happily enough,” he said to an interviewer, “I do not\r\nspeak English; otherwise I should have had to talk all the time\r\nand give explanations, instead of working. So I show them my black\r\ntrousers, and tell them in signs: ‘Begin by making the soil as\r\nblack as these trousers, then everything will be all right.’” Of\r\ncourse, to be profitable, immense quantities of stable manure are\r\nrequired, as also immense numbers of glass-bells and glass-frames,\r\nwhich represent a very costly outlay, and plenty of watering, to say\r\nnothing of the powers of observation required for developing a new\r\nbranch of gardening in new surroundings.\r\n\r\nWhat were the results obtained at Evesham it is difficult to say, the\r\nmore so as the money results which, according to some papers, were\r\nobtained the first year (_brutto_ income of £750 from three-quarters\r\nof an acre) seem to have been exaggerated for a first-year crop,\r\nand thus awakened scepticism with regard to that sort of culture\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nAnother experiment in the same direction was made on the estate of\r\nMayland, in Essex, which was bought by Mr. Joseph Fels in order\r\nto promote small farming in England. It must be said that, apart\r\nfrom the cold, damp climate of this part of England, the heavy clay\r\nof Essex represents the least appropriate soil for spade culture.\r\nIn England, as everywhere, this sort of culture has always been\r\ndeveloping in preference _on a light loam_, or in such places, like\r\nJersey, where a meagre granitic soil could easily be manured--in this\r\nspecial case by sea-weeds.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the aim of Mr. Fels having been chiefly educational,\r\nthis aim has certainly been achieved, as we have now, in three\r\ndifferent works of Mr. Thomas Smith, the manager of the farm,\r\npractical manuals teaching the would-be gardener the essentials of\r\n“French Gardening.”[127]\r\n\r\nA French _maraîcher_ having been invited for this purpose, and 2,500\r\nglass-bells, 1,000 lights for frames, a windmill pump, etc., having\r\nbeen bought at a considerable cost, the work of the French gardener\r\non two acres of land was carefully followed by the manager of the\r\nfarm, Mr. T. Smith, day by day, to be afterwards described and\r\nillustrated by photographs for the use of those who would like to try\r\ntheir hand at the same work.\r\n\r\nMost of my readers will probably ask first of all: What were the\r\nmoney results of this venture? But it would have been foolish to\r\nexpect that in this first experiment everything should have run as\r\nsmoothly as it runs, let us say, in the Channel Islands, where the\r\nmany years’ practice of a whole population has worked out the best\r\nmethods of culture.\r\n\r\nThus the frames were not ready in time for giving an early crop of\r\nmelons; and although the melons grown at Mayland were excellent, and\r\ngave the first year as much as £188, they would have given much more\r\nthan that had they been ready in the middle of June, which would have\r\nbeen possible if the frames and lights had been supplied in time.\r\n\r\nWith all that, the results obtained during the first year were\r\nreally striking. All taken, Mr. Smith shows that if the gardener\r\nhas a one-acre garden, and if £494 (say, £550) be spent for 1,000\r\nglass-bells, 300 lights and 100 frames, 500 mats, the water-supply,\r\nthe packing-shed, the fencing, the cart, horse and harness, etc.,\r\nand £413 (say, £450) for 500 tons of manure, the rent, rates and\r\nwater, and the wages and salaries (£250), the gross returns for the\r\nfirst year would reach £300 (making full allowance for “inexperience\r\nin this _special_ work”). They would reach from £400 to £450 during\r\nthe second year, there being greater productiveness and a lower\r\nexpenditure after the loam has been _made_ by heavy manuring, and\r\npersonal experience has been won, as well as experience for a given\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\nTaking a one-acre farm, of which only one-third is used for a French\r\ngarden, the first year’s expenditure for bells, lights, fencing,\r\nhorse manure, water, and rent and taxes would be a little less than\r\n£300, and the returns by the end of the first year would be about\r\n£150. “Afterwards the returns ought to reach from £200 to £250 each\r\nyear,” Mr. Smith writes.\r\n\r\nAll that need be added to these words is, that Mr. Smith is extremely\r\ncautious in his estimates, and that, seeing the high crops obtained\r\nat Mayland, and fully dealt with in Mr. Smith’s works, one is\r\nentitled to expect even better money results.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, after having worked at the farm for one year, the\r\nexperienced French gardener, who had obtained the just-mentioned\r\nresults, left Mayland. Two young French gardeners, far less\r\nexperienced, were invited instead, and they began to undo what their\r\npredecessor had done, in order to carry on the work on the lines they\r\nhad learned themselves. So that it is impossible to know yet what the\r\nresults of these new methods will be.\r\n\r\nEvery pioneer work has its unforeseen difficulties. But, so far\r\nas can be judged from the facts I have at my disposal, the two\r\nventures have proved that the climate of England is no obstacle\r\nto French gardening. Of course, the small amount of sunshine is\r\na great obstacle for ripening the produce as early as it can be\r\nripened in France, even in the suburbs of Paris. But home-grown\r\nfruit and vegetables have always many advantages in comparison with\r\nimported produce. Another disadvantage--the lack of horse manure--a\r\ndisadvantage which will go on increasing with the spread of motor\r\ncars--is felt in France as well. This is why the French growers\r\nare eagerly experimenting with the direct heating of the soil with\r\n_thermosiphons_.\r\n\r\nLet me add to these remarks that a decided awakening is to be noticed\r\nin this country for making a better use of the land than has been\r\nmade for the last fifty years. There are a few counties where the\r\nCounty Councils, and still more so, the Parish Councils, are doing\r\ntheir best to break at last the land monopoly, and to permit those\r\nsmall farmers who intend to cultivate the soil to do so. Here and\r\nthere we see a few timid attempts at imparting to the farmers and\r\ntheir children some knowledge of agriculture and horticulture. But\r\nall this is being made on too small a scale, and without a sincere\r\ndesire to learn from other European nations, and still more so from\r\nthe United States and Canada, what is being done in these countries\r\nto give to agriculture the new character of intensive culture\r\ncombined with industry, which is imposed upon it by the recent\r\nprogress of civilisation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe various data which have been brought together on the preceding\r\npages make short work of the over-population fallacy. It is\r\nprecisely in the most densely populated parts of the world that\r\nagriculture has lately made such strides as hardly could have been\r\nguessed twenty years ago. A dense population, a high development of\r\nindustry, and a high development of agriculture and horticulture,\r\ngo hand in hand: they are inseparable. As to the future, the\r\npossibilities of agriculture are such that, in truth, we cannot yet\r\nforetell what would be the limit of the population which could live\r\nfrom the produce of a given area. Recent progress, already tested on\r\na great scale, has widened the limits of agricultural production to\r\na quite unforeseen extent; and recent discoveries, now tested on a\r\nsmall scale, promise to widen those limits still farther, to a quite\r\nunknown degree.[128]\r\n\r\nThe present tendency of economical development in the world is--we\r\nhave seen--to induce more and more every nation, or rather every\r\nregion, taken in its geographical sense, to rely chiefly upon a home\r\nproduction of all the chief necessaries of life. Not to reduce, I\r\nmean, the world-exchange: it may still grow in bulk; but to limit it\r\nto the exchange of what really _must_ be exchanged, and, at the same\r\ntime, immensely to increase the exchange of novelties, produce of\r\nlocal or national art, new discoveries and inventions, knowledge and\r\nideas. Such being the tendency of present development, there is not\r\nthe slightest ground to be alarmed by it. There is not one nation in\r\nthe world which, being armed with the present powers of agriculture,\r\ncould not grow on its cultivable area all the food and most of the\r\nraw materials derived from agriculture which are required for its\r\npopulation, even if the requirements of that population were rapidly\r\nincreased as they certainly ought to be. Taking the powers of man\r\nover the land and over the forces of nature--_such as they are at\r\nthe present day_--we can maintain that two to three inhabitants to\r\neach cultivable acre of land would not yet be too much. But neither\r\nin this densely populated country nor in Belgium are we yet in such\r\nnumbers. In this country we have, roughly speaking, one acre of the\r\ncultivable area per inhabitant.\r\n\r\nSupposing, then, that each inhabitant of Great Britain were compelled\r\nto live on the produce of his own land, all he would have to do\r\nwould be, first, to consider the land of this country as a common\r\ninheritance, which must be disposed of to the best advantage of each\r\nand all--this is, evidently, an absolutely necessary condition. And\r\nnext, he would have to cultivate his soil, not in some extravagant\r\nway, but no better than land is already cultivated upon thousands\r\nand thousands of acres in Europe and America. He would not be bound\r\nto invent some new methods, but could simply generalise and widely\r\napply those which have stood the test of experience. He can do it;\r\nand in so doing he would save an immense quantity of the work which\r\nis now given for buying his food abroad, and for paying all the\r\nintermediaries who live upon this trade. Under a rational culture,\r\nthose necessaries and those luxuries which must be obtained from\r\nthe soil, undoubtedly _can_ be obtained with much less work than is\r\nrequired now for buying these commodities. I have made elsewhere (in\r\n_The Conquest of Bread_) approximate calculations to that effect, but\r\nwith the data given in this book everyone can himself easily test the\r\ntruth of this assertion. If we take, indeed, the masses of produce\r\nwhich are obtained under rational culture, and compare them with\r\nthe amount of labour which must be spent for obtaining them under\r\nan irrational culture, for collecting them abroad, for transporting\r\nthem, and for keeping armies of middlemen, we see at once how few\r\ndays and hours need be given, under proper culture, for growing man’s\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nFor improving our methods of culture to that extent, we surely\r\nneed not divide the land into one-acre plots, and attempt to grow\r\nwhat we are in need of by everyone’s separate individual exertions,\r\non everyone’s separate plot with no better tools than the spade;\r\nunder such conditions we inevitably should fail. Those who have\r\nbeen so much struck with the wonderful results obtained in the\r\n_petite culture_, that they go about representing the small culture\r\nof the French peasant, or _maraîcher_, as an ideal for mankind,\r\nare evidently mistaken. They are as much mistaken as those other\r\nextremists who would like to turn every country into a small number\r\nof huge Bonanza farms, worked by militarily organised “labour\r\nbattalions.” In Bonanza farms human labour is certainly reduced, but\r\nthe crops taken from the soil are far too small, and the whole system\r\nis robbery-culture, taking no heed of the exhaustion of the soil.\r\nThis is why the Bonanza farms have disappeared from their former\r\nhome, Ohio; and when I crossed part of this State in 1901 I saw its\r\nplains thickly dotted with medium-sized farms, from 100 to 200 acres,\r\nand with windmills pumping water for the orchards and the vegetable\r\ngardens. On the other side, in the spade culture, on isolated small\r\nplots, by isolated men or families, too much human labour is wasted,\r\neven though the crops are heavy; so that real economy--of both space\r\nand labour--requires different methods, representing a combination of\r\nmachinery work with hand work.\r\n\r\nIn agriculture, as in everything else, associated labour is the only\r\nreasonable solution. Two hundred families of five persons each,\r\nowning five acres per family, having no common ties between the\r\nfamilies, and compelled to find their living, each family on its\r\nfive acres, almost certainly would be an economical failure. Even\r\nleaving aside all _personal_ difficulties resulting from different\r\neducation and tastes and from the want of knowledge as to what has\r\nto be done with the land, and admitting for the sake of argument\r\nthat these causes do not interfere, the experiment would end in\r\na failure, merely for _economical_, for _agricultural_ reasons.\r\nWhatever improvement upon the present conditions such an organisation\r\nmight be, that improvement would not last; it would have to undergo a\r\nfurther transformation or disappear.\r\n\r\nBut the same two hundred families, if they consider themselves, say,\r\nas tenants of the nation, and treat the thousand acres as a common\r\ntenancy--again leaving aside the _personal_ conditions--would have,\r\neconomically speaking, from the point of view of the agriculturist,\r\nevery chance of succeeding, _if they know what is the best use to\r\nmake of that land_.\r\n\r\nIn such case they probably would first of all associate for\r\npermanently improving the land which is in need of immediate\r\nimprovement, and would consider it necessary to improve more\r\nof it every year, until they had brought it all into a perfect\r\ncondition. On an area of 340 acres they could most easily grow all\r\nthe cereals--wheat, oats, etc.--required for both the thousand\r\ninhabitants and their live stock, without resorting for that purpose\r\nto replanted or planted cereals. They could grow on 400 acres,\r\nproperly cultivated, and irrigated if necessary and possible, all\r\nthe green crops and fodder required to keep the thirty to forty\r\nmilch cows which would supply them with milk and butter, and, let us\r\nsay, the 300 head of cattle required to supply them with meat. On\r\ntwenty acres, two of which would be under glass, they would grow more\r\nvegetables, fruit and luxuries than they could consume. And supposing\r\nthat half an acre of land is attached to each house for hobbies\r\nand amusement (poultry keeping, or any fancy culture, flowers, and\r\nthe like)--they would still have some 140 acres for all sorts of\r\npurposes: public gardens, squares, manufactures and so on. The labour\r\nthat would be required for such an intensive culture would not be\r\nthe hard labour of the serf or slave. It would be accessible to\r\neveryone, strong or weak, town bred or country born; it would also\r\nhave many charms besides. And its total amount would be far smaller\r\nthan the amount of labour which every thousand persons, taken from\r\nthis or from any other nation, have now to spend in getting their\r\npresent food, much smaller in quantity and of worse quality. I mean,\r\nof course, the technically necessary labour, without even considering\r\nthe labour which we now have to give in order to maintain all our\r\nmiddlemen, armies, and the like. The amount of labour required to\r\ngrow food under a rational culture is so small, indeed, that our\r\nhypothetical inhabitants would be led necessarily to employ their\r\nleisure in manufacturing, artistic, scientific, and other pursuits.\r\n\r\nFrom the technical point of view there is no obstacle whatever for\r\nsuch an organisation being started to-morrow with full success. The\r\nobstacles against it are not in the imperfection of the agricultural\r\nart, or in the infertility of the soil, or in climate. They are\r\nentirely in our institutions, in our inheritances and survivals from\r\nthe past--in the “Ghosts” which oppress us. But to some extent they\r\nlie also--taking society as a whole--in our phenomenal ignorance. We,\r\ncivilised men and women, know everything, we have settled opinions\r\nupon everything, we take an interest in everything. We only know\r\nnothing about whence the bread comes which we eat--even though we\r\npretend to know something about that subject as well--we do not know\r\nhow it is grown, what pains it costs to those who grow it, what is\r\nbeing done to reduce their pains, what sort of men those feeders of\r\nour grand selves are ... we are more ignorant than savages in this\r\nrespect, and we prevent our children from obtaining this sort of\r\nknowledge--even those of our children who would prefer it to the\r\nheaps of useless stuff with which they are crammed at school.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[98] Charles Whitehead, _Hints on Vegetable and Fruit Farming_,\r\nLondon (J.

The industry of dried fruit, and especially of\r\ndried vegetables, has not yet developed in this country, the result\r\nbeing that during the Boer War Britain paid a weekly tribute to\r\nGermany for dried vegetables, which attained many thousands of pounds\r\nevery week. A nation cannot let its land be transformed into hunting\r\nreserves at the rate it is being done in this country without having\r\nto send the best and the most enterprising portion of its population\r\noverseas, and without relying for its daily food upon its neighbours\r\nand commercial rivals.\r\n\r\n[127] Thomas Smith, _French Gardening_, London (Utopia Press), 1909,\r\n128 pp.; _Profitable Culture of Vegetables, for Market Gardeners,\r\nSmall Holders, and Others_, London (Longmans, Green), 1911, 452 pp.;\r\nand a short summing up of the first of these works.\r\n\r\n[128] See Appendix T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nSMALL INDUSTRIES AND INDUSTRIAL VILLAGES.\r\n\r\n  Industry and agriculture--The small industries--Different\r\n  types--_Petty trades in Great Britain_: Sheffield, Leeds, Lake\r\n  District, Birmingham--Statistical data--_Petty trades in France_:\r\n  Weaving and various other trades--The Lyons region--Paris,\r\n  emporium of petty trades--Results of the census of 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two sister arts of agriculture and industry were not always so\r\nestranged from one another as they are now. There was a time, and\r\nthat time is not so far back, when both were thoroughly combined;\r\nthe villages were then the seats of a variety of industries, and the\r\nartisans in the cities did not abandon agriculture; many towns were\r\nnothing else but industrial villages. If the mediæval city was the\r\ncradle of those industries which bordered upon art and were intended\r\nto supply the wants of the richer classes, still it was the rural\r\nmanufacture which supplied the wants of the million, as it does until\r\nthe present day in Russia, and to a very great extent in Germany and\r\nFrance. But then came the water-motors, steam, the development of\r\nmachinery, and they broke the link which formerly connected the farm\r\nwith the workshop. Factories grew up and they abandoned the fields.\r\nThey gathered where the sale of their produce was easiest, or the raw\r\nmaterials and fuel could be obtained with the greatest advantage.\r\nNew cities rose, and the old ones rapidly enlarged; the fields were\r\ndeserted. Millions of labourers, driven away by sheer force from the\r\nland, gathered in the cities in search of labour, and soon forgot\r\nthe bonds which formerly attached them to the soil. And we, in our\r\nadmiration of the prodigies achieved under the new factory system,\r\noverlooked the advantages of the old system under which the tiller\r\nof the soil was an industrial worker at the same time. We doomed to\r\ndisappearance all those branches of industry which formerly used to\r\nprosper in the villages; we condemned in industry all that was not a\r\nbig factory.\r\n\r\nTrue, the results were grand as regards the increase of the\r\nproductive powers of man. But they proved terrible as regards the\r\nmillions of human beings who were plunged into misery and had to rely\r\nupon precarious means of living in our cities. Moreover, the system,\r\nas a whole, brought about those abnormal conditions which I have\r\nendeavoured to sketch in the two first chapters. We were thus driven\r\ninto a corner; and while a thorough change in the present relations\r\nbetween labour and capital is becoming an imperious necessity, a\r\nthorough remodelling of the whole of our industrial organisation has\r\nalso become unavoidable. The industrial nations are bound to revert\r\nto agriculture, they are compelled to find out the best means of\r\ncombining it with industry, and they must do so without loss of time.\r\n\r\nTo examine the special question as to the possibility of such a\r\ncombination is the aim of the following pages. Is it possible, from a\r\ntechnical point of view? Is it desirable? Are there, in our present\r\nindustrial life, such features as might lead us to presume that a\r\nchange in the above direction would find the necessary elements\r\nfor its accomplishment? Such are the questions which rise before\r\nthe mind. And to answer them, there is, I suppose, no better means\r\nthan to study that immense but overlooked and underrated branch of\r\nindustries which are described under the names of rural industries,\r\ndomestic trades, and petty trades: to study them, not in the works of\r\nthe economists who are too much inclined to consider them as obsolete\r\ntypes of industry, but in their life itself, in their struggles,\r\ntheir failures and achievements.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe variety of forms of organisation which is found in the small\r\nindustries is hardly suspected by those who have not made them a\r\nsubject of special study. There are, first, two broad categories:\r\nthose industries which are carried on in the villages, in connection\r\nwith agriculture; and those which are carried on in towns or in\r\nvillages, with no connection with the land--the workers depending for\r\ntheir earnings exclusively upon their industrial work.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, in France, in Germany, in Austria, and so on, millions\r\nand millions of workers are in the first case. They are owners or\r\noccupiers of the land, they keep one or two cows, very often horses,\r\nand they cultivate their fields, or their orchards, or gardens,\r\nconsidering industrial work as a by-occupation. In those regions,\r\nespecially, where the winter is long and no work on the land is\r\npossible for several months every year, this form of small industries\r\nis widely spread. In this country, on the contrary, we find the\r\nopposite extreme. Few small industries have survived in England\r\nin connection with land-culture; but hundreds of petty trades are\r\nfound in the suburbs and the slums of the great cities, and large\r\nportions of the populations of several towns, such as Sheffield and\r\nBirmingham, find their living in a variety of petty trades. Between\r\nthese two extremes there is evidently a mass of intermediate forms,\r\naccording to the more or less close ties which continue to exist\r\nwith the land. Large villages, and even towns, are thus peopled with\r\nworkers who are engaged in small trades, but most of whom have a\r\nsmall garden, or an orchard, or a field, or only retain some rights\r\nof pasture on the commons, while part of them live exclusively upon\r\ntheir industrial earnings.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the sale of the produce, the small industries offer\r\nthe same variety of organisation. Here again there are two great\r\nbranches. In one of them the worker sells his produce directly to the\r\nwholesale dealer; cabinet-makers, weavers, and workers in the toy\r\ntrade are in this case. In the other great division the worker works\r\nfor a “master” who either sells the produce to a wholesale dealer, or\r\nsimply acts as a middleman who himself receives his orders from some\r\nbig concern. This is the “sweating system,” properly speaking, under\r\nwhich we find a mass of small trades. Part of the toy trade, the\r\ntailors who work for large clothing establishments--very often for\r\nthose of the State--the women who sew and embroider the “uppers” for\r\nthe boot and shoe factories, and who as often deal with the factory\r\nas with an intermediary “sweater,” and so on, are in this case. All\r\npossible gradations of feudalisation and sub-feudalisation of labour\r\nare evidently found in that organisation of the sale of the produce.\r\n\r\nAgain, when the industrial, or rather technical aspects of the\r\nsmall industries are considered, the same variety of types is soon\r\ndiscovered. Here also there are two great branches: those trades,\r\non the one side, which are purely domestic--that is, those which\r\nare carried on in the house of the worker, with the aid of his\r\nfamily, or of a couple of wage-workers; and those which are carried\r\non in separate workshops--all the just-mentioned varieties, as\r\nregards connection with land and the divers modes of disposing\r\nof the produce, being met with in both these branches. All\r\npossible trades--weaving, workers in wood, in metals, in bone, in\r\nindia-rubber, and so on--may be found under the category of purely\r\ndomestic trades, with all possible gradations between the purely\r\ndomestic form of production and the workshop and the factory.\r\n\r\nThus, by the side of the trades which are carried on entirely at\r\nhome by one or more members of the family, there are the trades in\r\nwhich the master keeps a small workshop attached to his house and\r\nworks in it with his family, or with a few “assistants”--that is,\r\nwage-workers. Or else the artisan has a separate workshop, supplied\r\nwith wheel-power, as is the case with the Sheffield cutlers. Or\r\nseveral workers come together in a small factory which they maintain\r\nthemselves, or hire in association, or where they are allowed to\r\nwork for a certain weekly rent. And in each of these cases they\r\nwork either directly for the dealer or for a small master, or for a\r\nmiddleman.\r\n\r\nA further development of this system is the big factory, especially\r\nof ready-made clothes, in which hundreds of women pay so much for\r\nthe sewing-machine, the gas, the gas-heated irons, and so on, and\r\nare paid themselves so much for each piece of the ready-made clothes\r\nthey sew, or each part of it. Immense factories of this kind exist in\r\nEngland, and it appeared from testimony given before the “Sweating\r\nCommittee” that women are fearfully “sweated” in such workshops--the\r\nfull price of each slightly spoiled piece of clothing being deducted\r\nfrom their very low piecework wages.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, there is the small workshop (often with hired\r\nwheel-power) in which a master employs three to ten workers, who\r\nare paid in wages, and sells his produce to a bigger employer or\r\nmerchant--there being all possible gradations between such a workshop\r\nand the small factory in which a few time workers (five, ten to\r\ntwenty) are employed by an independent producer. In the textile\r\ntrades, weaving is often done either by the family or by a master who\r\nemploys one boy only, or several weavers, and after having received\r\nthe yarn from a big employer, pays a skilled workman to put the yarn\r\nin the loom, invents what is necessary for weaving a given, sometimes\r\nvery complicated pattern, and after having woven the cloth or the\r\nribbons in his own loom or in a loom which he hires himself, he is\r\npaid for the piece of cloth according to a very complicated scale of\r\nwages agreed to between masters and workers. This last form, we shall\r\nsee presently, is widely spread up to the present day, especially in\r\nthe woollen and silk trades; it continues to exist by the side of\r\nbig factories in which 50, 100, or 5,000 wage-workers, as the case\r\nmay be, are working with the employers’ machinery and are paid in\r\ntime-wages so much the day or the week.\r\n\r\nThe small industries are thus quite a world,[129] which, remarkable\r\nenough, continues to exist even in the most industrial countries,\r\nside by side with the big factories. Into this world we must now\r\npenetrate to cast a glimpse upon it: a glimpse only, because it\r\nwould take volumes to describe its infinite variety of pursuits and\r\norganisation, and its infinitely varied connection, with agriculture\r\nas well as with other industries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMost of the petty trades, except some of those which are connected\r\nwith agriculture, are, we must admit, in a very precarious position.\r\nThe earnings are very low, and the employment is often uncertain.\r\nThe day of labour is by two, three, or four hours longer than it is\r\nin well-organised factories, and at certain seasons it reaches an\r\nalmost incredible length. The crises are frequent and last for years.\r\nAltogether, the worker is much more at the mercy of the dealer or the\r\nemployer, and the employer is at the mercy of the wholesale dealer.\r\nBoth are liable to become enslaved to the latter, running into debt\r\nto him. In some of the petty trades, especially in the fabrication\r\nof the plain textiles, the workers are in dreadful misery. But those\r\nwho pretend that such misery is the rule are totally wrong. Anyone\r\nwho has lived among, let us say, the watch-makers in Switzerland and\r\nknows their inner family life, will recognise that the condition of\r\nthese workers was out of all comparison superior, in every respect,\r\nmaterial and moral, to the conditions of millions of factory hands.\r\nEven during such a crisis in the watch trade as was lived through\r\nin 1876-1880, their condition was preferable to the condition of\r\nfactory hands during a crisis in the woollen or cotton trade; and\r\nthe workers perfectly well knew it themselves.\r\n\r\nWhenever a crisis breaks out in some branch of the petty trades,\r\nthere is no lack of writers to predict that that trade is going to\r\ndisappear. During the crisis which I witnessed in 1877, living amidst\r\nthe Swiss watchmakers, the impossibility of a recovery of the trade\r\nin the face of the competition of machine-made watches was a current\r\ntopic in the press. The same was said in 1882 with regard to the silk\r\ntrade of Lyons, and, in fact, wherever a crisis has broken out in the\r\npetty trades. And yet, notwithstanding the gloomy predictions, and\r\nthe still gloomier prospects of the workers, that form of industry\r\ndoes not disappear. Even when some branch of it disappears, there\r\nalways remains something of it; some portions of it continue to exist\r\nas small industries (watchmaking of a high quality, best sorts of\r\nsilks, high quality velvets, etc.), or new connected branches grow\r\nup instead of the old ones, or the small industry, taking advantage\r\nof a mechanical motor, assumes a new form. We thus find it endowed\r\nwith an astonishing vitality. It undergoes various modifications, it\r\nadapts itself to new conditions, it struggles without losing hope of\r\nbetter times to come. Anyhow, it has not the characteristics of a\r\ndecaying institution. In some industries the factory is undoubtedly\r\nvictorious; but there are other branches in which the petty trades\r\nhold their own position. Even in the textile industries--especially\r\nin consequence of the wide use of the labour of children and\r\nwomen--which offer so many advantages for the factory system, the\r\nhand-loom still competes with the power-loom.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, the transformation of the petty trades into great\r\nindustries goes on with a slowness which cannot fail to astonish even\r\nthose who are convinced of its necessity. Nay, sometimes we may even\r\nsee the reverse movement going on--occasionally, of course, and only\r\nfor a time. I cannot forget my amazement when I saw at Verviers, some\r\nthirty years ago, that most of the woollen cloth factories--immense\r\nbarracks facing the streets by more than a hundred windows each--were\r\nsilent, and their costly machinery was rusting, while cloth was\r\nwoven in hand-looms in the weavers’ houses, for the owners of those\r\nvery same factories. Here we have, of course, but a temporary fact,\r\nfully explained by the spasmodic character of the trade and the heavy\r\nlosses sustained by the owners of the factories when they cannot run\r\ntheir mills all the year round. But it illustrates the obstacles\r\nwhich the transformation has to comply with. As to the silk trade,\r\nit continues to spread over Europe in its rural industry shape;\r\nwhile hundreds of new petty trades appear every year, and when they\r\nfind nobody to carry them on in the villages--as is the case in this\r\ncountry--they shelter themselves in the suburbs of the great cities,\r\nas we have lately learned from the inquiry into the “sweating system.”\r\n\r\nNow, the advantages offered by a large factory in comparison with\r\nhand work are self-evident as regards the economy of labour, and\r\nespecially--_this is the main point_--the facilities both for sale\r\nand for having the raw produce at a lower price. How can we then\r\nexplain the persistence of the petty trades? Many causes, however,\r\nmost of which cannot be valued in shillings and pence, are at work in\r\nfavour of the petty trades, and these causes will be best seen from\r\nthe following illustrations. I must say, however, that even a brief\r\nsketch of the countless industries which are carried on on a small\r\nscale in this country, and on the Continent, would be far beyond\r\nthe scope of this chapter. When I began to study the subject some\r\nthirty years ago, I never guessed, from the little attention devoted\r\nto it by the orthodox economists, what a wide, complex, important,\r\nand interesting organisation would appear at the end of a closer\r\ninquiry. So I see myself compelled to give here only a few typical\r\nillustrations, and to indicate the chief lines only of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Small Industries in the United Kingdom._\r\n\r\nWe have not for the United Kingdom such statistical data as are\r\nobtained in France and Germany by periodical censuses of all\r\nthe factories and workshops, and the numbers of the workpeople,\r\nforemen and clerks, employed on a given day in each industrial and\r\ncommercial establishment. Consequently, up to the present time all\r\nthe statements made by economists about the so-called “concentration”\r\nof the industry in this country, and the consequent “unavoidable”\r\ndisappearance of the small industries, have been based on mere\r\nimpressions of the writers,--not on statistical data. Up till now\r\nwe cannot give, as it is done further in these pages for France and\r\nGermany, the exact numbers of factories and workshops employing, let\r\nus say, from 1,000 to 2,000 persons, from 500 to 1,000, from 50 to\r\n500, less than 50, and so on. It is only since factory inspection has\r\nbeen introduced by the Factory Act of 1895 that we begin to find, in\r\nthe Reports published since 1900 by the Factory Inspectors (_Annual\r\nReport of the Chief Inspector of Factories and Workshops for the year\r\n1898_: London, 1900), information which permits us to get a general\r\nidea about the distribution of working men in factories of different\r\nsizes, and the extension that the petty trades have retained in this\r\ncountry up till now.[130] One may see it already from the following\r\nlittle table for the year 1897, which I take from the just-mentioned\r\nReport. These figures are not yet complete, especially as regards the\r\nworkshops, but they contain already the greater part of the English\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n  +---------------------+-------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n  |                     |  Number of  |  Number of   |    Average   |\r\n  |        1897.        |factories and|  operatives  |   number of  |\r\n  |                     |  workshops. |of both sexes.|operatives per|\r\n  |                     |             |              |establishment.|\r\n  +---------------------+-------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n  |Textile factories    |    10,883   |   1,051,564  |      97      |\r\n  |Non-textile factories|    79,059   |   2,755,460  |      35      |\r\n  |Various workshops    |    88,814   |     676,776  |       8      |\r\n  |                     +-------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n  |      Total          |   178,756   |   4,483,800  |      25      |\r\n  +---------------------+-------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n\r\nLet me remark that the Factory Inspectors consider as a _workshop_\r\nevery industrial establishment which has no mechanical motive power,\r\nand as a _factory_ every establishment provided with steam, gas,\r\nwater, or electric power.\r\n\r\nThese figures, however, are not complete, because only those\r\nworkshops are included where women and children are employed, as\r\nalso all the bakeries. The others were not submitted to inspection\r\nat the time when this table was compiled. There is, nevertheless, a\r\nmeans to find out the approximate numbers of workpeople employed in\r\nthe workshops. The number of women and female children employed in\r\nthe workshops in 1897 was 356,098, and the number of men and boys was\r\n320,678. But, as the proportion of male workers to the female in all\r\nthe factories was 2,654,716 males to 1,152,308 females, we may admit\r\nthat the same proportion prevails in the workshops. This would give\r\nfor the latter something like 820,000 male workers, and 1,176,000\r\npersons of both sexes, employed in 147,000 workshops. At the same\r\ntime, the grand total of persons employed in industry (exclusive of\r\nmining) would be 4,983,000.\r\n\r\nWe can thus say that _nearly one-fourth (24 per cent.) of all the\r\nindustrial workers of this country are working in workshops having\r\nless than eight to ten workers per establishment_.[131]\r\n\r\nIt must also be pointed out that out of the 4,483,800 workpeople\r\nregistered in the above-mentioned tables nearly 60,000 were children\r\nwho were working half-days only, 401,000 were girls less than\r\neighteen years old, 463,000 were boys from thirteen to eighteen\r\nwho were making full working days like the adults, and 1,077,115\r\nwere considered as _women_ (more than eighteen years old). In other\r\nwords, one-fifth part of all the industrial workers of this country\r\nwere girls and boys, and more than two-fifths (41 per cent.) were\r\neither women or children. All the industrial production of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, with its immense exports, was thus _giving work to\r\nless than three million adult men_--2,983,000 out of a population\r\nof 42,000,000, to whom we must add 972,200 persons working in the\r\nmines. As to the textile industry, which supplies almost one-half of\r\nthe English exports, _there are less than_ 300,000 _adult men who\r\nfind employment in it_. The remainder is the work of children, boys,\r\ngirls, and women.\r\n\r\nA fact which strikes us is that the 1,051,564 workpeople--men, women\r\nand children--who worked in 1897 in the textile industries of the\r\nUnited Kingdom were distributed over 10,883 factories, which gives\r\nonly an average of ninety-three persons per factory in all this\r\ngreat industry, notwithstanding the fact that “concentration” has\r\nprogressed most in this industry, and that we find in it factories\r\nemploying as many as 5,000 and 6,000 persons.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Factory Inspectors represent each separate branch\r\nof a given industry as a special establishment. Thus, if an employer\r\nor a society owns a spinning mill, a weaving factory, and a special\r\nbuilding for dressing and finishing, the three are represented as\r\nseparate factories. But this is precisely what is wanted for giving\r\nus an exact idea about the degree of concentration of a given\r\nindustry. Besides, it is also known that, for instance, in the\r\ncotton industry, in the neighbourhood of Manchester, the spinning,\r\nthe weaving, the dressing and so on belong very often to different\r\nemployers, who send to each other the stuffs at different degrees of\r\nfabrication; those factories which combine under the same management\r\nall the three or four consecutive phases of the manufacture are an\r\nexception.\r\n\r\nBut it is especially in the division of the non-textile industries\r\nthat we find an enormous development of small factories. The\r\n2,755,460 workpeople who are employed in all the non-textile\r\nbranches, with the exception of mining, are scattered in 79,059\r\nfactories, each of which has only an average of thirty-five workers.\r\nMoreover, the Factory Inspectors had on their lists 676,776\r\nworkpeople employed in 88,814 workshops (without mechanical power),\r\nwhich makes an average of eight persons only per workshop. These last\r\nfigures are, however, as we saw, below the real ones, as another\r\nsixty thousand workshops occupying half a million more workpeople\r\nwere not yet tabulated.\r\n\r\nSuch averages as _ninety-three and thirty-five workpeople per\r\nfactory, and eight per workshop_, distributed over 178,756 industrial\r\nestablishments, destroy already the legend according to which the big\r\nfactories have already absorbed most of the small ones. The figures\r\nshow, on the contrary, what an immense number of small factories\r\nand workshops resist the absorption by the big factories, and how\r\nthey multiply by the side of the great industry in various branches,\r\nespecially those of recent origin.\r\n\r\nIf we had for the United Kingdom full statistics, giving lists of\r\nall the factories, with the number of workpeople employed in each\r\nof them, as we have for France and Germany (see below), it would\r\nhave been easy to find the exact number of factories employing more\r\nthan 1,000, 500, 100, and 50 workmen. But such lists are issued\r\nonly for the mining industry. As to the statistics published by the\r\nFactory Inspectors, they do not contain such data, perhaps because\r\nthe inspectors have no time to tabulate their figures, or have not\r\nthe right to do so. Be it as it may, the Report of Mr. Whitelegge\r\nfor 1897 gives the number of factories (textile and non-textile) and\r\nworkshops for each of the 119 counties of the United Kingdom and for\r\neach of the nearly hundred sub-divisions of all the industries, as\r\nwell as the number of workpeople in each of these more than 10,000\r\nsub-divisions. So I was enabled to calculate the _averages_ of\r\npersons employed in the factories and workshops for each separate\r\nbranch of industry in each county. Besides, Mr. Whitelegge has had\r\nthe kindness to give me two very important figures--namely, the\r\nnumber of factories employing more than 1,000 workpeople, and the\r\nnumber of those _factories_ where less than ten workers are employed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us take, first of all, the TEXTILE industries, which include\r\ncotton, wool, silk, linen, jute, and hemp, as well as machine-made\r\nlace and knitting. Many of my readers will probably be astonished\r\nto learn that even in the cotton industry a great number of quite\r\nsmall factories continue to exist up to the present day. Even in the\r\nWest Riding district, which is second only to Lancashire for the\r\nnumber of its cotton mills, and where we find nearly one-third of all\r\nthe workpeople employed in the cotton industry (237,444 persons),\r\nthe average for all the 3,210 factories of this district is only\r\nseventy-three persons per factory. And even in Lancashire, where we\r\nfind nearly one-half of all the workpeople employed in the textiles,\r\nthese 434,609 men, women, and children are scattered in 3,132\r\nfactories, each of which has thus an average of only 139 workers. If\r\nwe remember that in this number there are factories employing from\r\n2,000 to 6,000 persons, one cannot but be struck by the quantity of\r\nsmall factories employing less than 100 persons, and which continue\r\nto exist by the side of the great cotton mills. But we shall just see\r\nthat the same is true for all industries.\r\n\r\nAs to Nottinghamshire, which is a centre for machine-made lace and\r\nknitting, its 18,434 workpeople are, most of them, working in small\r\nfactories. The average for the 386 establishments of this county is\r\nonly forty-eight persons per factory. The great industry is thus very\r\nfar from having absorbed the small one.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the textile factories in the other counties of\r\nthe United Kingdom is even more instructive. We learn that there are\r\nnearly 2,000 textile factories in forty-nine counties, and everyone\r\nof these factories has much less than 100 workpeople; while a very\r\nconsiderable number of them employ only from forty to fifty, from ten\r\nto twenty, and even less than ten persons.[132]\r\n\r\nThis could have been foreseen by everyone who has some practical\r\nknowledge of industry, but it is overlooked by the theorists, who\r\nknow industry mostly from books. In every country of the world there\r\nare by the side of the large factories a great number of small ones,\r\nthe success of which is due to the variety of their produce and the\r\nfacilities they offer to follow the vagaries of fashion. This is\r\nespecially true with regard to the woollens and the mixed stuffs made\r\nof wool and cotton.\r\n\r\nBesides, it is well known to British manufacturers that at the\r\ntime when the big cotton mills were established, the manufacturers\r\nof spinning and weaving machinery, seeing that they had no more\r\norders coming, after they had supplied this machinery to the great\r\nfactories, began to offer it at a reduced price and on credit to\r\nthe small weavers. These last associated--three, five, or more of\r\nthem--to buy the machinery, and this is why we have now in Lancashire\r\nquite a region where a great number of small cotton mills continue to\r\nexist till nowadays, without there being any reason to foresee their\r\ndisappearance. At times they are even quite prosperous.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the other side, when we examine the various branches of textile\r\nindustry (cotton, wool, silk, jute, etc.), we see that if the great\r\nfactories dominate in the spinning and weaving of cotton, worsted\r\nand flax, as well as in the spinning of silk (the result being that\r\nthe average for these branches reaches 150 workers per factory\r\nfor cotton, and 267 for the spinning of flax), _all other textile\r\nindustries belong to the domain of the middle-sized and the small\r\nindustry_. In other words, in the manufacture of woollens, shoddy,\r\nhemp, hair, machine-made lace, and mechanical knitting, as also\r\nin the weaving of silks, there are, of course, large factories;\r\nbut the majority of these establishments belong to the domain of\r\nthe small industry. Thus, for the 3,274 woollen factories, the\r\naverage is only from twenty to fifty workers per factory; it is also\r\nfrom twenty-seven to thirty-eight for shoddy, and thirty-seven to\r\nseventy-six for the other branches. Only for knitting do the averages\r\nrise to ninety-three persons per factory; but we are just going to\r\nsee that the small industry reappears in this branch in force under\r\nthe name of workshops.\r\n\r\nAll these important branches of the British textile industry, which\r\ngive work to more than 240,000 men and women, have thus remained up\r\ntill now at the stage of a small and middle-sized industry.\r\n\r\nIf we take now the NON-TEXTILE industries, we find, on the one side,\r\nan immense number of small industries which have grown up around\r\nthe great ones, and owing to them; and, on the other side, a large\r\npart of the fundamental industries have remained in the stage of\r\nsmall establishments. The average for all these branches, which give\r\noccupation to three-fourths of all the industrial workers of the\r\nUnited Kingdom--that is, 2,755,460 workers--hardly attains, we saw,\r\nthirty-five persons per factory--the workshops being not yet included\r\nin this division. However, it is especially when we go into details,\r\nand analyse the figures which I have calculated for each separate\r\nbranch, that we fully realise the importance of the petty trades\r\nin England. This is what we are going to do, mentioning first what\r\nbelongs here to the great industry, and studying next the small one.\r\n\r\nFollowing the classification adopted by the Factory Inspectors, we\r\nsee first that the gas-works belong to the domain of the fairly\r\nbig establishments (seventy-eight people on the average). The\r\nindia-rubber factories belong to the same category (125 workers\r\non the average); and amidst the 456 glass-works of the United\r\nKingdom there must be some big ones, as the average is eighty-seven\r\nworkpeople.\r\n\r\nNext come mining and metallurgy, which are carried on, as a rule,\r\non a great scale; but already in the iron foundries we find a great\r\nnumber of establishments belonging to the middle-sized and small\r\nindustry. Thus at Sheffield I saw myself several foundries employing\r\nonly from five to six workmen. For the making of huge machinery\r\nthere is, of course, a number of very large works, such as those of\r\nArmstrong, Whitworth, or those of the State at Woolwich. But it is\r\nvery instructive to see how very small works prosper by the side of\r\nbig ones; they are numerous enough to reduce the average to seventy\r\nworkers per establishment for the 5,318 works of this category.\r\n\r\nShipbuilding and the manufacture of metallic tubes evidently\r\nbelong to the great industry (averages, 243 and 156 persons per\r\nestablishment); and the same applies to the two great metallurgical\r\nworks of the State, which employ between them 23,455 workmen.\r\n\r\nGoing over to the chemical works, we find again a great industry in\r\nthe fabrication of alkalies and of matches (only twenty-five works);\r\nbut, on the contrary, the fabrication of soap and candles, as well\r\nas manures and all other sorts of chemical produce, which represents\r\nnearly 2,000 factories, belongs almost entirely to the domain of\r\nthe small industry. The average is only twenty-nine workpeople per\r\nfactory. There are, of course, half a dozen of very large soap\r\nworks--one knows them only too well by their advertisements on the\r\ncliffs and in the fields; but the low average of twenty-nine workmen\r\nproves how many small factories must exist by the side of the soap\r\nkings. The 2,500 works engaged in the fabrication of furniture, both\r\nin wood and in iron, belong again chiefly to the small industry.\r\nThe small and very small factories swarm by the side of a few great\r\nones, to say nothing of the thousands of the still smaller workshops.\r\nThe great storehouses of our cities are for the most part mere\r\nexhibitions of furniture made in very small factories and workshops.\r\n\r\nIn the fabrication of food produce we find several great sugar,\r\nchocolate, and preserves works; but by their side we find also a very\r\ngreat number of small establishments, which seem not to complain\r\nof the proximity of the big ones, as they occupy nearly two-thirds\r\nof the workers employed in this branch. I do not speak, of course,\r\nof the village windmills, but one cannot fail to be struck by the\r\nimmense number of small breweries (2,076 breweries have on the\r\naverage only twenty-four workmen each) and of the establishments\r\nengaged in the fabrication of aerated waters (they number 3,365, and\r\nhave on the average only eleven operatives per establishment).\r\n\r\nIn calico-printing we enter once more the domain of great factories;\r\nbut by their side we find a pretty large number of small ones;\r\nso that the average for all this category is 144 workpeople per\r\nfactory. We find also fourteen great factories, having an average\r\nof 394 workpeople each, for dyeing in Turkey red. But we find also\r\nby their side more than 100,000 working-men employed in 2,725 small\r\nestablishments of this class--bleaching, dressing, packing, and\r\nso on--and this gives us one more illustration of numerous small\r\nindustries growing round the main ones.\r\n\r\nIn the making of ready-made clothing and the fabrication of hats,\r\nlinen, boots and shoes, and gloves, we see the averages for the\r\nfactories of this description going up to 80, 100, and 150 persons\r\nper factory. But it is here also that countless small workshops come\r\nin. It must also be noticed that most of the factories of ready-made\r\nclothing have their own special character. The factory buys the cloth\r\nand makes the cutting by means of special machinery; but the sewing\r\nis done by women, who come to work in the factory. They pay so much\r\nthe sewing-machine, so much the motor power (if there is one), so\r\nmuch the gas, so much the iron, and so on, and they are on piece\r\nwork. Very often this becomes a “sweating system” on a large scale.\r\nRound the big factories a great number of small workshops are centred.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, we find great factories for the fabrication of\r\ngunpowder and explosives (they employ less than 12,000 workpeople),\r\nstuff buttons, and umbrellas (only 6,000 employees). But we find also\r\nin the table of workshops that in these last two branches there are\r\nthousands of them by the side of a few great factories.\r\n\r\nAll taken, Mr. Whitelegge writes to me that of factories employing\r\nmore than 1,000 workpeople each, he finds _only sixty-five in the\r\ntextile industries_ (102,600 workpeople) and only 128 (355,208\r\nworkpeople) _in all non-textile industries_.\r\n\r\nIn this brief enumeration we have gone over all that belongs to\r\nthe great industry. The remainder belongs almost entirely to the\r\ndomain of the small, and often the very small industry. Such are all\r\nthe factories for woodwork, which have on the average only fifteen\r\nmen per establishment, but represent a contingent of more than\r\n100,000 workmen and more than 6,000 employers. The tanneries, the\r\nmanufacture of all sorts of little things in ivory and bone, and even\r\nthe brick-works and the potteries, representing a total of 260,000\r\nworkpeople and 11,200 employers, belong, with a very few exceptions,\r\nto the small industry.\r\n\r\nThen we have the factories dealing with the burnishing and enamelling\r\nof metals, which also belong chiefly to the small industry--the\r\naverage being only twenty-eight workpeople per factory. But what is\r\nespecially striking is the development of the small and very small\r\nindustry in the fabrication of agricultural machinery (thirty-two\r\nworkers per factory), of all sorts of tools (twenty-two on the\r\naverage), needles and pins (forty-three), ironmongery, sanitary\r\napparatus, and various instruments (twenty-five), even of boilers\r\n(forty-eight per factory), chains, cables, and anchors (in many\r\ndistricts this work, as also the making of nails, is made by hand by\r\n_women_).\r\n\r\nNeedless to say that the fabrication of furniture, which occupies\r\nnearly 64,000 operatives, belongs chiefly--more than three-fourths\r\nof it--to the small industry. The average for the 1,979 factories of\r\nthis branch is only twenty-one workpeople, the workshops not being\r\nincluded in this number. The same is true of the factories for the\r\ncuring of fish, machine-made pastry, and so on, which occupy 38,030\r\nworkpeople in more than 2,700 factories, having thus an average of\r\nfourteen operatives each.\r\n\r\nJewelry and the manufacture of watches, photographic apparatus, and\r\nall sorts of luxury articles, again belong to the small and very\r\nsmall industry, and give occupation to 54,000 persons.\r\n\r\nAll that belongs to printing, lithography, bookbinding, and\r\nstationery again represents a vast field occupied by the small\r\nindustry, which prospers by the side of a small number of very large\r\nestablishments. More than 120,000 are employed in these branches in\r\nmore than 6,000 factories (workshops not yet included).\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, we find a large domain occupied by saddlery,\r\nbrush-making, the making of sails, basket-making, and the fabrication\r\nof a thousand little things in leather, paper, wood, metal, and so\r\non. This class is certainly not insignificant, as it contains more\r\nthan 4,300 employers and nearly 130,000 workpeople, employed in a\r\nmass of very small factories by the side of a few very great ones,\r\nthe average being only from twenty-five to thirty-five persons per\r\nfactory.\r\n\r\nIn short, in the different non-textile industries, the inspectors\r\nhave tabulated _32,042 factories employing, each of them, less than\r\nten workpeople_.\r\n\r\nAll taken, we find 270,000 workpeople employed in small factories\r\nhaving less than fifty and even twenty workers each, the result being\r\nthat the very great industry (the factories employing more than\r\n1,000 workpeople per factory) and the very small one (less than ten\r\nworkers) employ nearly the same number of operatives.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe important part played by the small industry in this country\r\nfully appears from this rapid sketch. And I have not yet spoken of\r\nthe workshops. The Factory Inspectors mentioned, as we saw, in their\r\nfirst report, 88,814 workshops, in which 676,776 workpeople (356,098\r\nwomen) were employed in 1897. But, as we have already seen, these\r\nfigures are incomplete. The number of workshops is about 147,000, and\r\nthere must be about 1,200,000 persons employed in them (820,000 men\r\nand about 356,000 women and children).\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this class comprises a very considerable number\r\nof bakers, small carpenters, tailors, cobblers, cartwrights, village\r\nsmiths, and so on. But there is also in this class an immense number\r\nof workshops belonging to industry, properly speaking--that is,\r\nworkshops which manufacture for the great commercial market. Some of\r\nthese workshops may of course employ fifty persons or more, but the\r\nimmense majority employ only from five to twenty workpeople each.\r\n\r\nWe thus find in this class 1,348 small establishments, scattered both\r\nin the villages and the suburbs of great cities, where nearly 14,000\r\npersons make lace, knitting, embroidery, and weaving in hand-looms;\r\nmore than 100 small tanneries, more than 20,000 cartwrights, and 746\r\nsmall bicycle makers. In cutlery, in the fabrication of tools and\r\nsmall arms, nails and screws, and even anchors and anchor chains, we\r\nfind again many thousands of small workshops employing something\r\nlike 60,000 workmen. All that, let us remember, without counting\r\nthose workshops which employ no women or children, and therefore\r\nare not submitted to the Factory Inspectors. As to the fabrication\r\nof clothing, which gives work to more than 350,000 men and women,\r\ndistributed over nearly 45,000 workshops, let it be noted that\r\nit is not small tailors that is spoken of here, but that mass of\r\n_workshops_ which swarm in Whitechapel and the suburbs of all great\r\ncities, and where we find from five to fifty women and men making\r\nclothing for the tailor shops, big and small. In these shops the\r\nmeasure is taken, and sometimes the cutting is made; but the clothing\r\nis sewn in the small workshops, which are very often somewhere in\r\nthe country. Even parts of the commands of linen and clothing for\r\nthe army find their way to workshops in country places. As to the\r\nunderclothing and mercery which are sold in the great stores, they\r\nare fabricated in small workshops, which must be counted by the\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of furniture, mattresses and cushions, hats,\r\nartificial flowers, umbrellas, slippers, and even cheap jewelry. The\r\ngreat shops, even the largest stores, mostly keep only an assortment\r\nof samples. All is manufactured at a very low price, and _day by\r\nday_, in thousands of small workshops.\r\n\r\nIt can thus be said that if we exclude from the class of workshops’\r\nemployees 100,000 or even 200,000 workpeople who do not work for\r\n_industry_ properly speaking, and if we add on the other side the\r\nnearly 500,000 workers who have not yet been tabulated by the\r\ninspectors in 1897, we find a population of more than 1,000,000 men\r\nand women who belong entirely to the domain of the small industry,\r\nand so must be added to those whom we found working in the small\r\nfactories. The artisans who are working single-handed were not\r\nincluded in this sketch.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that even in this country, which may be considered\r\nas representing the highest development of the great industry,\r\nthe number of persons employed in the small trade continues to be\r\nimmense. The small industries are as much a distinctive feature of\r\nthe British industry as its few immense factories and ironworks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGoing over now to what is known about the small industries of this\r\ncountry from direct observation, we find that the suburbs of London,\r\nGlasgow, and other great cities swarm with small workshops, and\r\nthat there are regions where the petty trades are as developed as\r\nthey are in Switzerland or in Germany. Sheffield is a well-known\r\nexample in point. The Sheffield cutlery--one of the glories of\r\nEngland--is _not_ made by machinery: it is chiefly made by hand.\r\nThere are at Sheffield a number of firms which manufacture cutlery\r\nright through from the making of steel to the finishing of tools,\r\nand employ wage-workers; and yet even these firms--I am told by\r\nEdward Carpenter, who kindly collected for me information about\r\nthe Sheffield trade--let out some part of their work to the “small\r\nmasters.” But by far the greatest number of the cutlers work in their\r\nhomes with their relatives, or in small workshops supplied with\r\nwheel-power, which they rent for a few shillings a week. Immense\r\nyards are covered with buildings, which are subdivided into numbers\r\nof small workshops. Some of these cover but a few square yards, and\r\nthere I saw smiths hammering, all the day long, blades of knives\r\non a small anvil, close by the blaze of their fires; occasionally\r\nthe smith may have one helper, or two. In the upper storeys scores\r\nof small workshops are supplied with wheel-power, and in each of\r\nthem, three, four, or five workers and a “master” fabricate, with\r\nthe occasional aid of a few plain machines, every description of\r\ntools: files, saws, blades of knives, razors, and so on. Grinding and\r\nglazing are done in other small workshops, and even steel is cast in\r\na small foundry, the working staff of which consists only of five or\r\nsix men.\r\n\r\nWhen I walked through these workshops I easily imagined myself in\r\na Russian cutlery village, like Pavlovo or Vorsma. The Sheffield\r\ncutlery has thus maintained its olden organisation, and the fact is\r\nthe more remarkable as the earnings of the cutlers are low as a rule;\r\nbut, even when they are reduced to a few shillings a week, the cutler\r\nprefers to vegetate on his small earnings than to enter as a waged\r\nlabourer in a “house.” The spirit of the old trade organisations,\r\nwhich were so much spoken of in the ’sixties of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, is thus still alive.\r\n\r\nUntil lately, Leeds and its environs were also the seat of extensive\r\ndomestic industries. When Edward Baines wrote, in 1857, his first\r\naccount of the Yorkshire industries (in Th. Baines’s _Yorkshire,\r\nPast and Present_), most of the woollen cloth which was made in that\r\nregion was woven by hand.[133] Twice a week the hand-made cloth\r\nwas brought to the Clothiers’ Hall, and by noon it was sold to the\r\nmerchants, who had it dressed in their factories. Joint-stock mills\r\nwere run by combined clothiers in order to prepare and spin the\r\nwool, but it was woven in the hand-looms by the clothiers and the\r\nmembers of their families. Twelve years later the hand-loom was\r\nsuperseded to a great extent by the power-loom; but the clothiers,\r\nwho were anxious to maintain their independence, resorted to a\r\npeculiar organisation: they rented a room, or part of a room, and\r\nsometimes also the power-looms, and they worked independently--a\r\ncharacteristic organisation partly maintained until now, and well\r\nadapted to illustrate the efforts of the petty traders to keep their\r\nground, notwithstanding the competition of the factory. And it must\r\nbe said that the triumphs of the factory were too often achieved only\r\nby means of the most fraudulent adulteration and the underpaid labour\r\nof the children.\r\n\r\nThe variety of domestic industries carried on in the Lake District is\r\nmuch greater than might be expected, but they still wait for careful\r\nexplorers. I will only mention the hoop-makers, the basket trade,\r\nthe charcoal-burners, the bobbin-makers, the small iron furnaces\r\nworking with charcoal at Backbarrow, and so on.[134] As a whole, we\r\ndo not well know the petty trades of this country, and therefore\r\nwe sometimes come across quite unexpected facts. Few continental\r\nwriters on industrial topics would guess, indeed, that twenty-five\r\nyears ago nails were made by hand by thousands of men, women, and\r\nchildren in the Black Country of South Staffordshire, as also in\r\nDerbyshire,[135] and that some of this industry remains still in\r\nexistence, or that the best needles are made by hand at Redditch.\r\nChains are also made by hand at Dudley and Cradley, and although the\r\nPress is periodically moved to speak of the wretched conditions of\r\nthe chain-makers, men and women, the trade still maintains itself;\r\nwhile nearly 7,000 men were busy in 1890 in their small workshops\r\nin making locks, even of the plainest description, at Walsall,\r\nWolverhampton, and Willenhall. The various ironmongeries connected\r\nwith horse-clothing--bits, spurs, bridles, and so on--are also\r\nlargely made by hand at Walsall.\r\n\r\nThe Birmingham gun and rifle trades, which also belong to the same\r\ndomain of small industries, are well known. As to the various\r\nbranches of dress, there are still important divisions of the United\r\nKingdom where a variety of domestic trades connected with dress\r\nis carried on on a large scale. I need only mention the cottage\r\nindustries of Ireland, as also some of them which have survived in\r\nthe shires of Buckingham, Oxford, and Bedford; hosiery is a common\r\noccupation in the villages of the counties of Nottingham and Derby;\r\nand several great London firms send out cloth to be made into\r\ndress in the villages of Sussex and Hampshire. Woollen hosiery is\r\nat home in the villages of Leicester, and especially in Scotland;\r\nstraw-plaiting and hat-making in many parts of the country; while at\r\nNorthampton, Leicester, Ipswich, and Stafford shoemaking was, till\r\nquite lately, a widely spread domestic occupation, or was carried\r\non in small workshops; even at Norwich it remains a petty trade to\r\nsome extent, notwithstanding the competition of the factories. It\r\nmust also be said that the recent appearance of large boot and shoe\r\nfactories has considerably increased the number of girls and women\r\nwho sew the “uppers” and embroider the slippers, either in their own\r\nhouses or in sweaters’ workshops, while new small factories have\r\ndeveloped of late for the making of heels, card-boxes, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe petty trades are thus an important factor of industrial life even\r\nin Great Britain, although many of them have gathered into the towns.\r\nBut if we find in this country so many fewer rural industries than on\r\nthe Continent, we must not imagine that their disappearance is due\r\nonly to a keener competition of the factories. The chief cause was\r\nthe compulsory exodus from the villages.\r\n\r\nAs everyone knows from Thorold Rogers’ work, the growth of the\r\nfactory system in England was intimately connected with that enforced\r\nexodus. Whole industries, which prospered till then, were killed\r\ndownright by the forced clearing of estates.[136] The workshops,\r\nmuch more even than the factories, multiply wherever they find\r\ncheap labour; and the specific feature of this country is, that\r\nthe cheapest labour--that is, the greatest number of destitute\r\npeople--is to be found in the great cities. The agitation raised\r\n(with no result) in connection with the “Dwellings of the Poor,” the\r\n“Unemployed,” and the “Sweating System,” has fully disclosed that\r\ncharacteristic feature of the economic life of England and Scotland;\r\nand the painstaking researches made by Mr. Charles Booth have shown\r\nthat one-quarter of the population of London--that is, 1,000,000 out\r\nof the 3,800,000 who entered within the scope of his inquest--would\r\nbe happy if the heads of their families could have regular earnings\r\nof something like £1 a week all the year round. Half of them would\r\nbe satisfied with even less than that. The same state of things was\r\nfound by Mr. Seebohm Rowntree at York.[137] Cheap labour is offered\r\nin such quantities in the suburbs of all the great cities of Great\r\nBritain, that the petty and domestic trades, which are scattered on\r\nthe Continent in the villages, gather in this country in the cities.\r\n\r\nExact figures as to the small industries are wanting, but a simple\r\nwalk through the suburbs of London would do much to realise the\r\nvariety of petty trades which swarm in the metropolis, and, in fact,\r\nin all chief urban agglomerations. The evidence given before the\r\n“Sweating System Committee” has shown how far the furniture and\r\nready-made clothing palaces and the “Bonheur des Dames” bazaars of\r\nLondon are mere exhibitions of samples, or markets for the sale of\r\nthe produce of the small industries. Thousands of sweaters, some\r\nof them having their own workshops, and others merely distributing\r\nwork to sub-sweaters who distribute it again amidst the destitute,\r\nsupply those palaces and bazaars with goods made in the slums or\r\nin very small workshops. The commerce _is_ centralised in those\r\nbazaars--not the industry. The furniture palaces and bazaars are thus\r\nmerely playing the part which the feudal castle formerly played in\r\nagriculture: they centralise the profits--not the production.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the extension of the petty trades, side by side with the\r\ngreat factories, is nothing to be wondered at. It is an economic\r\nnecessity. The absorption of the small workshops by bigger concerns\r\nis a fact which had struck the economists in the ’forties of the last\r\ncentury, especially in the textile trades. It is continued still in\r\nmany other trades, and is especially striking in a number of very\r\nbig concerns dealing with metals and war supplies for the different\r\nStates. But there is another process which is going on parallel with\r\nthe former, and which consists in the continuous creation of new\r\nindustries, usually making their start on a small scale. Each new\r\nfactory calls into existence a number of small workshops, partly to\r\nsupply its own needs and partly to submit its produce to a further\r\ntransformation. Thus, to quote but one instance, the cotton mills\r\nhave created an immense demand for wooden bobbins and reels, and\r\nthousands of men in the Lake District set to manufacture them--by\r\nhand first, and later on with the aid of some plain machinery. Only\r\nquite recently, after years had been spent in inventing and improving\r\nthe machinery, the bobbins began to be made on a larger scale in\r\nfactories. And even yet, as the machines are very costly, a great\r\nquantity of bobbins are made in small workshops, with but little aid\r\nfrom machines, while the factories themselves are relatively small,\r\nand seldom employ more than fifty operatives--chiefly children. As\r\nto the reels of irregular shape, they are still made by hand, or\r\npartly with the aid of small machines, continually invented by the\r\nworkers. New industries thus grow up to supplant the old ones; each\r\nof them passes through a preliminary stage on a small scale before\r\nreaching the great factory stage; and the more active the inventive\r\ngenius of a nation is, the more it has of these budding industries.\r\nThe countless small bicycle works which have lately grown up in\r\nthis country, and are supplied with ready-made parts of the bicycle\r\nby the larger factories, are an instance in point. The domestic\r\nand small workshops fabrication of boxes for matches, boots, hats,\r\nconfectionery, grocery and so on is another familiar instance.\r\n\r\nBesides, the large factory stimulates the birth of new petty trades\r\nby creating new wants. The cheapness of cottons and woollens, of\r\npaper and brass, has created hundreds of new small industries. Our\r\nhouseholds are full of their produce--mostly things of quite modern\r\ninvention. And while some of them already are turned out by the\r\nmillion in the great factory, all have passed through the small\r\nworkshop stage, before the demand was great enough to require the\r\ngreat factory organisation. The more we may have of new inventions,\r\nthe more shall we have of such small industries; and again, the more\r\nwe have of them, the more shall we have of the inventive genius,\r\nthe want of which is so justly complained of in this country (by W.\r\nArmstrong, amongst many others). We must not wonder, therefore, if\r\nwe see so many small trades in this country; but we must regret that\r\nthe great number have abandoned the villages in consequence of the\r\nbad conditions of land tenure, and that they have migrated in such\r\nnumbers to the cities, to the detriment of agriculture.\r\n\r\nIn England, as everywhere, the small industries are an important\r\nfactor in the industrial life of the country; and it is chiefly\r\nin the infinite variety of the small trades, which utilise the\r\nhalf-fabricated produce of the great industries, that inventive\r\ngenius is developed, and the rudiments of the future great industries\r\nare elaborated. The small bicycle workshops, with the hundreds\r\nof small improvements which they introduced, have been under our\r\nvery eyes the primary cells out of which the great industry of the\r\nmotor cars, and later on of the aeroplanes, has grown up. The small\r\nvillage jam-makers were the precursors and the rudiments of the great\r\nfactories of preserves which now employ hundreds of workers. And so\r\non.\r\n\r\nConsequently, to affirm that the small industries are doomed to\r\ndisappear, while we see new ones appear every day, is merely to\r\nrepeat a hasty generalisation that was made in the earlier part of\r\nthe nineteenth century by those who witnessed the absorption of\r\nhand-work by machinery work in the cotton industry--a generalisation\r\nwhich, as we saw already, and are going still better to see on the\r\nfollowing pages, finds no confirmation from the study of industries,\r\ngreat and small, and is upset by the censuses of the factories and\r\nworkshops. Far from showing a tendency to disappear, the small\r\nindustries show, on the contrary, a tendency towards making a further\r\ndevelopment, since the municipal supply of electrical power--such\r\nas we have, for instance, in Manchester--permits the owner of a\r\nsmall factory to have a cheap supply of motive power, exactly in the\r\nproportion required at a given time, and to pay only for what is\r\nreally consumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Petty Trades in France._\r\n\r\nSmall industries are met with in France in a very great variety,\r\nand they represent a most important feature of national economy.\r\nIt is estimated, in fact, that while one-half of the population of\r\nFrance live upon agriculture, and one-third upon industry, this\r\nthird part is equally distributed between the great industry and\r\nthe small one.[138] This last occupies about 1,650,000 workers\r\nand supports from 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 persons. A considerable\r\nnumber of peasants who resort to small industries without abandoning\r\nagriculture would have to be added to the just-mentioned items, and\r\nthe additional earnings which these peasants find in industry are\r\nso important that in several parts of France peasant proprietorship\r\ncould not be maintained without the aid derived from the rural\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nThe small peasants know what they have to expect the day they\r\nbecome factory hands in a town; and so long as they have not been\r\ndispossessed by the money-lender of their lands and houses, and\r\nso long as the village rights in the communal grazing grounds or\r\nwoods have not been lost, they cling to a combination of industry\r\nwith agriculture. Having, in most cases, no horses to plough the\r\nland, they resort to an arrangement which is widely spread, if not\r\nuniversal, among small French landholders, even in purely rural\r\ndistricts (I saw it even in Haute-Savoie). One of the peasants who\r\nkeeps a plough and a team of horses tills all the fields in turn. At\r\nthe same time, owing to a wide maintenance of the communal spirit,\r\nwhich I have described elsewhere,[139] further support is found in\r\nthe communal shepherd, the communal wine-press, and various forms\r\nof “aids” amongst the peasants. And wherever the village-community\r\nspirit is maintained, the small industries persist, while no effort\r\nis spared to bring the small plots under higher culture.\r\n\r\nMarket-gardening and fruit culture often go hand in hand with\r\nsmall industries. And wherever well-being is found on a relatively\r\nunproductive soil, it is nearly always due to a combination of the\r\ntwo sister arts.\r\n\r\nThe most wonderful adaptations of the small industries to new\r\nrequirements, and substantial technical progress in the methods\r\nof production, can be noted at the same time. It may even be\r\nsaid of France, as it has been said of Russia, that when a rural\r\nindustry dies out, the cause of its decay is found much less in\r\nthe competition of rival factories--in hundreds of localities the\r\nsmall industry undergoes a complete modification, or it changes\r\nits character in such cases--than in the decay of the population\r\n_as agriculturists_. Continually we see that only when the small\r\nlandholders have been ruined, as such, by a group of causes--the loss\r\nof communal meadows, or abnormally high rents, or the havoc made\r\nin some locality by the _marchands de biens_ (swindlers enticing\r\nthe peasants to buy land on credit), or the bankruptcy of some\r\nshareholders’ company whose shares had been eagerly taken by the\r\npeasants[140]--only then do they abandon both the land and the rural\r\nindustry and emigrate towards the towns.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, a new industry always grows up when the competition of the\r\nfactory becomes too acute--a wonderful, hardly suspected adaptability\r\nbeing displayed by the small industries; or else the rural artisans\r\nresort to some form of intensive farming, gardening, etc., and in the\r\nmeantime some other industry makes its appearance. A closer study of\r\nFrance under this aspect is instructive in a high degree.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in most textile industries the power-loom\r\nsupersedes the hand-loom, and the factory takes, or has taken\r\nalready, the place of the cottage industry. Cottons, plain linen, and\r\nmachine-made lace are now produced at such a low cost by machinery\r\nthat hand-weaving evidently becomes an anachronism for the plainest\r\ndescriptions of such goods. Consequently, though there were in\r\nFrance, in the year 1876, 328,300 hand-looms as against 121,340\r\npower-looms, it may safely be taken that the number of the former has\r\nbeen considerably reduced within the next twenty years. However, the\r\nslowness with which this change is being accomplished is one of the\r\nmost striking features of the present industrial organisation of the\r\ntextile trades of France.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this power of resistance of hand-loom-weaving become\r\nespecially apparent when one consults such works as Reybaud’s _Le\r\nCoton_, which was written in 1863, nearly half a century ago--that\r\nis, at a time when the cottage industries were still fully alive.\r\nThough an ardent admirer himself of the great industries, Reybaud\r\nfaithfully noted the striking superiority of well-being in the\r\nweavers’ cottages as compared with the misery of the factory hands\r\nin the cities. Already then, the cities of St. Quentin, Lille,\r\nRoubaix and Amiens were great centres for cotton-spinning mills and\r\ncotton-weaving factories. But, at the same time, all sorts of cottons\r\nwere woven in hand-looms, in the very suburbs of St. Quentin and in a\r\nhundred villages and hamlets around it, to be sold for finishing in\r\nthe city. And Reybaud remarked that the horrible dwellings in town,\r\nand the general condition of the factory hands, stood in a wonderful\r\ncontrast with the relative welfare of the rural weavers. Nearly\r\nevery one of these last had his own house and a small field which he\r\ncontinued to cultivate.[141]\r\n\r\nEven in such a branch as the fabrication of plain cotton velvets, in\r\nwhich the competition of the factories was especially keenly felt,\r\nhome-weaving was widely spread, in 1863 and even in 1878, in the\r\nvillages round Amiens. Although the earnings of the rural weavers\r\nwere small, as a rule, the weavers preferred to keep to their own\r\ncottages, to their own crops and to their own cattle; and only\r\nrepeated commercial crises, as well as several of the above-mentioned\r\ncauses, hostile to the small peasant, compelled most of them to give\r\nup the struggle, and to seek employment in the factories, while part\r\nof them have, by this time, again returned to agriculture or taken to\r\nmarket-gardening.\r\n\r\nAnother important centre for rural industries was in the\r\nneighbourhood of Rouen, where no less than 110,000 persons were\r\nemployed, in 1863, in weaving cottons for the finishing factories of\r\nthat city. In the valley of the Andelle, in the department of Eure,\r\neach village was at that time an industrial bee-hive; each streamlet\r\nwas utilised for setting into work a small factory. Reybaud described\r\nthe condition of the peasants who combined agriculture with work at\r\nthe rural factory as most satisfactory, especially in comparison with\r\nthe condition of the slum-dwellers at Rouen, and he even mentioned a\r\ncase or two in which the village factories belonged to the village\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nSeventeen years later, Baudrillart[142] depicted the same region in\r\nvery much the same words; and although the rural factories had had to\r\nyield to a great extent before the big factories, the rural industry\r\nwas still valued as showing a yearly production of 85,000,000 francs\r\n(£2,400,000).\r\n\r\nAt the present time, the factories must have made further progress;\r\nbut we still see from the excellent descriptions of M. Ardouin\r\nDumazet, whose work will have in the future almost the same value\r\nas Arthur Young’s _Travels_,[143] that a considerable portion of\r\nthe rural weavers has still survived; while at the same time one\r\ninvariably meets, even nowadays, with the remark that relative\r\nwell-being is prominent in the villages in which weaving is connected\r\nwith agriculture.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time, M. Ardouin Dumazet writes, “there is an\r\nindustry which gives work to many hand-looms in the villages; it\r\nis the weaving of various stuffs for umbrellas and ladies’ boots.”\r\nAmiens is the chief centre for this weaving.[144] In other places\r\nthey are making dresses out of Amiens velvet and various stuffs woven\r\nat Roubaix. It is a new industry; it has taken the place of the old\r\none, which was making of Amiens a second Lyons.\r\n\r\nIn the district of Le Thelle, to the south of Beauvais, there\r\nis “a multitude of petty trades, of which one hardly imagines\r\nthe importance. I have seen,” M. Dumazet says, “small factories\r\nof buttons made from bone, ivory, or mother-of-pearl, brushes,\r\nshoe-horns, keys for pianos, dominoes, counters and dice,\r\nspectacle-cases, small articles for the writing-table, handles for\r\ntools, measures, billiard keys--what not!... There is not one single\r\nvillage, however small, the population of which should not have its\r\nown industry.”[145] At the same time it must not be forgotten that\r\nthousands of small articles for the writing-table and for draughtsmen\r\nare fabricated on a large scale in the small factories in the same\r\nregion. Some of the workshops are situated in private houses, and in\r\nsome of them artistic work is made; but most of them are located in\r\nspecial houses, where the necessary power is hired by the owner of\r\nthe workshop. You see here “a fantastic activity”--the word is M.\r\nDumazet’s; the division of labour is very great, and everywhere they\r\ninvent new machine-tools.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the villages of the Vermandois district (department of\r\nthe Aisne), we find a considerable number of hand-looms (more than\r\n3,000) upon which mixed stuffs made of cotton, wool and silk are\r\nwoven.[146]\r\n\r\nOf course, it must be recognised that, as a rule, in northern France,\r\nwhere cottons are fabricated on a large scale in factory towns,\r\nhand-weaving in the villages is nearly gone. But, as is seen already\r\nfrom the preceding, new small industries have grown up instead, and\r\nthis is also the case in many other parts of France.\r\n\r\nTaking the region situated between Rouen in the north-east, Orléans\r\nin the south-east, Rennes in the north-west, and Nantes in the\r\nsouth-west--that is, the old provinces of Normandy, Perche and\r\nMaine, and partly Touraine and Anjou, as they were seen by Ardouin\r\nDumazet in 1895--we find there quite a variety of domestic and petty\r\nindustries, both in the villages and in the towns.\r\n\r\nAt Laval (to the south-east of Rennes), where drills (_coutils_) were\r\nformerly woven out of flax in hand-looms, and at Alençon, formerly\r\na great centre for the cottage-weaving of linen, as well as for\r\nhand-made lace, Ardouin Dumazet found both the house and the factory\r\nlinen industry in a lingering state. Cotton takes the lead. Drills\r\nare now made out of cotton in the factories, and the demand for flax\r\ngoods is very small. Both domestic and factory weaving of flax goods\r\nare accordingly in a poor condition. The cottagers abandoned that\r\nbranch of weaving, and the large factories, which had been erected\r\nat Alençon with the intention of creating a flax and hemp-cloth\r\nindustry, had to be closed. Only one factory, occupying 250 hands,\r\nremains; while nearly 23,000 weavers, who found occupation at Mans,\r\nFresnay and Alençon in hemp cloths and fine linen, had to abandon\r\nthat industry. Those who worked in factories have emigrated to other\r\ntowns, while those who had not broken with agriculture reverted to\r\nit. In this struggle of cotton _versus_ flax and hemp, the former was\r\nvictorious.\r\n\r\nAs to lace, it is made in such quantities by machinery at Calais,\r\nCaudry, St. Quentin and Tarare that only high-class artistic\r\nlace-making continues on a small scale at Alençon itself, but it\r\nstill remains a by-occupation in the surrounding country. Besides, at\r\nFlers, and at Ferté Macé (a small town to the south of the former),\r\nhand-weaving is still carried on in about 5,400 hand-looms, although\r\nthe whole trade, in factories and villages alike, is in a piteous\r\nstate since the Spanish markets have been lost. Spain has now plenty\r\nof her own cotton mills. Twelve big spinning mills at Condé (where\r\n4,000 tons of cotton were spun in 1883) were abandoned in 1893, and\r\nthe workers were thrown into a most miserable condition.[147]\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, in an industry which supplies the home\r\nmarket--namely, in the fabrication of linen handkerchiefs, which\r\nitself is of a quite recent growth--we see that cottage-weaving is,\r\neven now, in full prosperity. Cholet (in Maine-et-Loire, south-west\r\nof Angers) is the centre of that trade. It has one spinning mill\r\nand one weaving mill, but both employ considerably fewer hands than\r\ndomestic weaving, which is spread over no less than 200 villages of\r\nthe surrounding region.[148] Neither at Rouen nor in the industrial\r\ncities of Northern France are so many linen handkerchiefs fabricated\r\nas in this region in hand-looms, we are told by Ardouin Dumazet.\r\n\r\nWithin the curve made by the Loire as it flows past Orléans we find\r\nanother prosperous centre of domestic industries connected with\r\ncottons. “From Romorantin [in Loire-et-Cher, south of Orléans] to\r\nArgenton and Le Blanc,” the same writer says, “we have one immense\r\nworkshop where handkerchiefs are embroidered, and shirts, cuffs,\r\ncollars and all sorts of ladies’ linen are sewn or embroidered.\r\nThere is not one house, even in the tiniest hamlets, where the women\r\nwould not be occupied in that trade ... and if this work is a mere\r\n_passe-temps_ in vine-growing regions, here it has become the chief\r\nresource of the population.”[149] Even at Romorantin itself, where\r\n400 women and girls are employed in one factory, there are more than\r\n1,000 women who sew linen in their houses.\r\n\r\nThe same must be said of a group of industrial villages peopled with\r\nclothiers in the neighbourhood of another Normandy city, Elbœuf.\r\nWhen Baudrillart visited them in 1878-1880, he was struck with\r\nthe undoubted advantages offered by a combination of agriculture\r\nwith industry. Clean houses, clean dresses, and a general stamp of\r\nwell-being were characteristic of these villages.\r\n\r\nHappily enough, weaving is not the only small industry of both\r\nthis region and Brittany. On the contrary, scores of other small\r\nindustries enliven the villages and burgs. At Fougères (in\r\nIlle-et-Vilaine, to the north-east of Reims) one sees how the\r\nfactory has contributed to the development of various small and\r\ndomestic trades. In 1830 this town was a great centre for the\r\ndomestic fabrication of the so-called _chaussons de tresse_. The\r\ncompetition of the prisons killed, however, this primitive industry;\r\nbut it was soon substituted by the fabrication of soft socks in\r\nfelt (_chaussons de feutre_). This last industry also went down,\r\nand then the fabrication of boots and shoes was introduced, this\r\nlast giving origin, in its turn, to the boot and shoe factories,\r\nof which there are now thirty-three at Fougères, employing 8,000\r\nworkers[150] (yearly production about 5,000,000 pairs). But at the\r\nsame time domestic industries took a new development. Thousands of\r\nwomen are employed now in their houses in sewing the “uppers” and\r\nin embroidering fancy shoes. Moreover, quite a number of smaller\r\nworkshops grew up in the neighbourhood, for the fabrication of\r\ncardboard boxes, wooden heels, and so on, as well as a number of\r\ntanneries, big and small. And M. Ardouin Dumazet’s remark is, that\r\none is struck to find, owing to these industries, an undoubtedly\r\nhigher level of well-being in the villages--quite unforeseen in the\r\ncentre of this purely agricultural region.[151]\r\n\r\nIn Brittany, in the neighbourhood of Quimperlé, a great number of\r\nsmall workshops for the fabrication of the felt hats which are worn\r\nby the peasants is scattered in the villages; and rapidly improving\r\nagriculture goes hand in hand with that trade. Well-being is a\r\ndistinctive feature of these villages.[152] At Hennebont (on the\r\nsouthern coast of Brittany) 1,400 workers are employed in an immense\r\nfactory in the fabrication of tins for preserves, and every year\r\ntwenty-two to twenty-three tons of iron are transformed into steel,\r\nand next into tins, which are sent to Paris, Bordeaux, Nantes, and so\r\non. But the factory has created “quite a world of tiny workshops” in\r\nthis purely agricultural region: small tin-ware workshops, tanneries,\r\npotteries, and so on, while the slags are transformed in small\r\nfactories into manure.\r\n\r\nAgriculture and industry are thus going here hand in hand, the\r\nimportance of not severing the union being perhaps best seen at\r\nLoudéac, a small town in the midst of Brittany (department of\r\nCôtes-du-Nord). Formerly the villages in this neighbourhood were\r\nindustrial, all hamlets being peopled with weavers who fabricated\r\nthe well-known Brittany linen. Now, this industry having gone down\r\nvery much, the weavers have simply returned to the soil. Out of an\r\nindustrial town, Loudéac has become an agricultural market town;[153]\r\nand, what is most interesting, these populations conquer new lands\r\nfor agriculture and turn the formerly quite unproductive _landes_\r\ninto rich corn fields; while on the northern coast of Brittany,\r\naround Dol, on land which began to be conquered from the sea in the\r\ntwelfth century, market-gardening is now carried on to a very great\r\nextent for export to England.\r\n\r\nAltogether, it is striking to observe, on perusing M. Ardouin\r\nDumazet’s little volumes, how domestic industries go hand in hand\r\nwith all sorts of small industries in agriculture--gardening,\r\npoultry-farming, fabrication of fruit preserves, and so on--and how\r\nall sorts of associations for sale and export are easily introduced.\r\nMans is, as known, a great centre for the export of geese and all\r\nsorts of poultry to England.\r\n\r\nPart of Normandy (namely, the departments of Eure and Orne) is\r\ndotted with small workshops where all sorts of small brass goods and\r\nhardware are fabricated in the villages. Of course, the domestic\r\nfabrication of pins is nearly gone, and as for needles, polishing\r\nonly, in a very primitive form, has been maintained in the villages.\r\nBut all sorts of small hardware, including nails, lockets, etc.,\r\nin great variety, are fabricated in the villages, especially round\r\nLaigle. Stays are also sewn in small workshops in many villages,\r\nnotwithstanding the competition of prison work.[154]\r\n\r\nTinchebrai (to the west of Flers) is a real centre for a great\r\nvariety of smaller goods in iron, mother-of-pearl and horn. All\r\nsorts of hardware and locks are fabricated by the peasants during\r\nthe time they can spare from agriculture, and real works of art,\r\nsome of which were much admired at the exhibition of 1889, are\r\nproduced by these humble peasant sculptors in horn, mother-of-pearl\r\nand iron. Farther south, the polishing of marble goods is carried on\r\nin numbers of small workshops, scattered round Solesmes and grouped\r\nround one central establishment where marble pieces are roughly\r\nshaped with the aid of steam, to be finished in the small village\r\nworkshops. At Sablé the workers in that branch, who all own their\r\nhouses and gardens, enjoy a real well-being especially noticed by our\r\ntraveller.[155]\r\n\r\nIn the woody regions of the Perche and the Maine we find all sorts of\r\nwooden industries which evidently could only be maintained owing to\r\nthe communal possession of the woods. Near the forest of Perseigne\r\nthere is a small burg, Fresnaye, which is entirely peopled with\r\nworkers in wood.\r\n\r\n  “There is not one house,” Ardouin Dumazet writes, “in which\r\n  wooden goods would not be fabricated. Some years ago there was\r\n  little variety in their produce; spoons, salt-boxes, shepherds’\r\n  boxes, scales, various wooden pieces for weavers, flutes and\r\n  hautboys, spindles, wooden measures, funnels, and wooden bowls\r\n  were only made. But Paris wanted to have a thousand things in\r\n  which wood was combined with iron: mouse-traps, cloak-pegs,\r\n  spoons for jam, brooms.... And now every house has a workshop\r\n  containing either a turning-lathe, or some machine-tools for\r\n  chopping wood, for making lattice-work, and so on.... Quite a\r\n  new industry was born, and the most coquettish things are now\r\n  fabricated. Owing to this industry the population is happy. The\r\n  earnings are not high, but each worker owns his house and garden,\r\n  and occasionally a bit of field.”[156]\r\n\r\nAt Neufchâtel wooden shoes are made, and the hamlet, we are told,\r\nhas a most smiling aspect. To every house a garden is attached, and\r\nnone of the misery of big cities is to be seen. At Jupilles and in\r\nthe surrounding country other varieties of wooden goods are produced:\r\ntaps, boxes of different kinds, together with wooden shoes; while at\r\nthe forest of Vibraye two workshops have been erected for turning\r\nout umbrella handles by the million for all France. One of these\r\nworkshops having been founded by a worker sculptor, he has invented\r\nand introduced in his workshop the most ingenious machine-tools.\r\nAbout 150 men work at this factory; but it is evident that half\r\na dozen smaller workshops, scattered in the villages, would have\r\nanswered equally well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGoing now over to a quite different region--the Nièvre, in the centre\r\nof France, and Haute Marne, in the east--we find that both regions\r\nare great centres for a variety of small industries, some of which\r\nare maintained by associations of workers, while others have grown up\r\nin the shadow of factories. The small iron workshops which formerly\r\ncovered the country have not disappeared: they have undergone a\r\ntransformation; and now the country is covered with small workshops\r\nwhere agricultural machinery, chemical produce, and pottery are\r\nfabricated; “one ought to go as far as Guérigny and Fourchambault to\r\nfind the great industry;”[157] while a number of small workshops for\r\nthe fabrication of a variety of hardware flourish by the side of, and\r\nowing to the proximity of, the industrial centres.\r\n\r\nPottery makes the fortune of the valley of the Loire about Nevers.\r\nHigh-class art pottery is made in this town, while in the villages\r\nplain pottery is fabricated and exported by merchants who go about\r\nwith their boats selling it. At Gien a large factory of china buttons\r\n(made out of felspar-powder cemented with milk) has lately been\r\nestablished, and employs 1,500 workmen, who produce from 3,500 to\r\n4,500 lb. of buttons every day. And, as is often the case, part of\r\nthe work is done in the villages. For many miles on both banks of\r\nthe Loire, in all villages, old people, women and children sew the\r\nbuttons to the cardboard pieces. Of course, that sort of work is\r\nwretchedly paid; but it is resorted to only because there is no other\r\nsort of industry in the neighbourhood to which the peasants could\r\ngive their leisure time.\r\n\r\nIn the same region of the Haute Marne, especially in the\r\nneighbourhood of Nogent, we find cutlery as a by-occupation to\r\nagriculture. Landed property is very much subdivided in that part\r\nof France, and great numbers of peasants own but from two to three\r\nacres per family, or even less. Consequently, in thirty villages\r\nround Nogent, about 5,000 men are engaged in cutlery, chiefly of\r\nthe highest sort (artistic knives are occasionally sold at as\r\nmuch as £20 a piece), while the lower sorts are fabricated in the\r\nneighbourhoods of Thiers, in Puy-de-Dôme (Auvergne). The Nogent\r\nindustry has developed spontaneously, with no aid from without, and\r\nin its technical part it shows considerable progress.[158] At Thiers,\r\nwhere the cheapest sorts of cutlery are made, the division of labour,\r\nthe cheapness of rent for small workshops supplied with motive power\r\nfrom the Durolle river, or from small gas motors, the aid of a\r\ngreat variety of specially invented machine-tools, and the existing\r\ncombination of machine-work with hand-work have resulted in such a\r\nperfection of the technical part of the trade that it is considered\r\ndoubtful whether the factory system could further economise\r\nlabour.[159] For twelve miles round Thiers, in each direction, all\r\nthe streamlets are dotted with small workshops, in which peasants,\r\nwho continue to cultivate their fields, are at work.\r\n\r\nBasket-making is again an important cottage industry in several\r\nparts of France, namely in Aisne and in Haute Marne. In this last\r\ndepartment, at Villaines, everyone is a basket-maker, “and all the\r\nbasket-makers belong to a co-operative society,” Ardouin Dumazet\r\nremarks.[160] “There are no employers; all the produce is brought\r\nonce a fortnight to the co-operative stores and there it is sold for\r\nthe association. About 150 families belong to it, and each owns a\r\nhouse and some vineyards.” At Fays-Billot, also in Haute Marne, 1,500\r\nbasket-makers belong to an association; while at Thiérache, where\r\nseveral thousand men are engaged in the same trade, no association\r\nhas been formed, the earnings being in consequence extremely low.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother very important centre of petty trades is the French Jura,\r\nor the French part of the Jura Mountains, where the watch trade\r\nhas attained, as known, a high development. When I visited these\r\nvillages between the Swiss frontier and Besançon in the year 1878,\r\nI was struck by the high degree of relative well-being which I\r\ncould observe, even though I was perfectly well acquainted with\r\nthe Swiss villages in the Val de Saint Imier. It is very probable\r\nthat the machine-made watches have brought about a crisis in French\r\nwatch-making as they have in Switzerland. But it is known that\r\npart, at least, of the Swiss watch-makers have strenuously fought\r\nagainst the necessity of being enrolled in the factories, and that\r\nwhile watch factories grew up at Geneva and elsewhere, considerable\r\nnumbers of the watch-makers have taken to divers other trades which\r\ncontinue to be carried on as domestic or small industries. I must\r\nonly add that in the French Jura great numbers of watch-makers were\r\nat the same time owners of their houses and gardens, very often of\r\nbits of fields, and especially of communal meadows, and that the\r\ncommunal _fruitières_, or creameries, for the common sale of butter\r\nand cheese, are widely spread in that part of France.\r\n\r\nSo far as I could ascertain, the development of the machine-made\r\nwatch industry has not destroyed the small industries of the\r\nJura hills. The watch-makers have taken to new branches, and, as\r\nin Switzerland, they have created various new industries. From\r\nArdouin Dumazet’s travels we can, at anyrate, borrow an insight\r\ninto the present state of the southern part of this region. In the\r\nneighbourhoods of Nantua and Cluses silks are woven in nearly all\r\nvillages, the peasants giving to weaving their spare time from\r\nagriculture, while quite a number of small workshops (mostly less\r\nthan twenty looms, one of 100 looms) are scattered in the little\r\nvillages, on the streamlets running from the hills. Scores of\r\nsmall saw-mills have also been built along the streamlet Merloz,\r\nfor the fabrication of all sorts of little pretty things in wood.\r\nAt Oyonnax, a small town on the Ain, we have a big centre for the\r\nfabrication of combs, an industry more than 200 years old, which\r\ntook a new development since the last war through the invention of\r\ncelluloid. No less than 100 or 120 “masters” employ from two to\r\nfifteen workers each, while over 1,200 persons work in their houses,\r\nmaking combs out of Irish horn and French celluloid. Wheel-power was\r\nformerly rented in small workshops, but electricity, generated by\r\na waterfall, has lately been introduced, and is now distributed in\r\nthe houses for bringing into motion small motors of from one-quarter\r\nto twelve horse-power. And it is remarkable to notice that as soon\r\nas electricity gave the possibility to return to domestic work, 300\r\nworkers left at once the small workshops and took to work in their\r\nhouses. Most of these workers have their own cottages and gardens,\r\nand they show a very interesting spirit of association. They have\r\nalso erected four workshops for making cardboard boxes, and their\r\nproduction is valued at 2,000,000 fr. every year.[161]\r\n\r\nAt St. Claude, which is a great centre for briar pipes (sold in large\r\nquantities in London with English trade-marks, and therefore eagerly\r\nbought by those Frenchmen who visit London, as a _souvenir_ from the\r\nother side of the Channel), both big and small workshops, supplied by\r\nmotive force from the Tacon streamlet, prosper by the side of each\r\nother. Over 4,000 men and women are employed in this trade, while\r\nall sorts of small by-trades have grown by its side (amber and horn\r\nmouth-pieces, sheaths, etc.). Countless small workshops are busy\r\nbesides, on the banks of the two streams, with the fabrication of all\r\nsorts of wooden things: match-boxes, beads, sheaths for spectacles,\r\nsmall things in horn, and so on, to say nothing of a rather large\r\nfactory (200 workers) where metric measures are fabricated for the\r\nwhole world. At the same time thousands of persons in St. Claude,\r\nin the neighbouring villages and in the smallest mountain hamlets,\r\nare busy in cutting diamonds (an industry only fifteen years old in\r\nthis region), and other thousands are busy in cutting various less\r\nprecious stones. All this is done in quite small workshops supplied\r\nby water-power.[162]\r\n\r\nThe extraction of ice from some lakes and the gathering of oak-bark\r\nfor tanneries complete the picture of these busy villages, where\r\nindustry joins hands with agriculture, and modern machines and\r\nappliances are so well put in the service of the small workshops.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, at Besançon, which was, in 1878, when I visited\r\nit, a great centre for watch-making, “all taken, nothing has yet\r\nbeen changed in the habits of the working-class,” M. Dumazet wrote\r\nin 1901. The watch-makers continued to work in their houses or in\r\nsmall workshops.[163] Only there was no complete fabrication of the\r\nwatch or the clock. Many important parts--the wheels, etc.--were\r\nimported from Switzerland or from different towns of France. And, as\r\nis always the case, numerous small secondary workshops for making the\r\nwatch-cases, the hands, and so on, grew up in that neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe same has to be said of Montbéliard--another important centre of\r\nthe watch trade. By the side of the manufactures, where all the parts\r\nof the mechanism of the watch are fabricated by machinery, there is\r\nquite a number of workshops where various parts of the watch are made\r\nby skilled workmen; and this industry has already given birth to a\r\nnew branch--the making of various tools for these workshops, as also\r\nfor different other trades.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the same region, such as Héricourt, a variety of\r\nsmall industries has grown by the side of the great ironmongery\r\nfactories. The city spreads into the villages, where the population\r\nare making coffee-mills, spice-mills, machines for crushing the grain\r\nfor the cattle, as well as saddlery, small ironmongery, or even\r\nwatches. Elsewhere the fabrication of different small parts of the\r\nwatch having been monopolised by the factories, the workshops began\r\nto manufacture the small parts of the bicycles, and later on of the\r\nmotor-cars. In short, we have here quite a world of industries of\r\nmodern origin, and with them of inventions made to simplify the work\r\nof the hand.\r\n\r\nFinally, omitting a mass of small trades, I will only name the\r\nhat-makers of the Loire, the stationery of the Ardèche, the\r\nfabrication of hardware in the Doubs, the glove-makers of the\r\nIsère, the broom and brush-makers of the Oise (valued at £800,000\r\nper annum), and the house machine-knitting in the neighbourhoods of\r\nTroyes. But I must say a few words more about two important centres\r\nof small industries: the Lyons region and Paris.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the present time the industrial region of which Lyons is the\r\ncentre[164] includes the departments of Rhône, Loire, Drôme,\r\nSaône-et-Loire, Ain, the southern part of the Jura department, and\r\nthe western part of Savoy, as far as Annecy, while the silkworm\r\nis reared as far as the Alps, the Cévennes Mountains, and the\r\nneighbourhoods of Mâcon. It contains, besides fertile plains,\r\nlarge hilly tracks, also very fertile as a rule, but covered with\r\nsnow during part of the winter, and the rural populations are\r\ntherefore bound to resort to some industrial occupation in addition\r\nto agriculture; they find it in silk-weaving and various small\r\nindustries. Altogether it may be said that the _région lyonnaise_ is\r\ncharacterised as a separate centre of French civilisation and art,\r\nand that a remarkable spirit of research, discovery and invention has\r\ndeveloped there in all directions--scientific and industrial.\r\n\r\nThe Croix Rousse at Lyons, where the silk-weavers (_canuts_) have\r\ntheir chief quarters, is the centre of that industry, and in 1895 the\r\nwhole of that hill, thickly covered with houses, five, six, eight\r\nand ten storeys high, resounded with the noise of the looms which\r\nwere busily going in every department of that big agglomeration.\r\nElectricity has lately been brought into the service of this\r\ndomestic industry, supplying motive power to the looms.\r\n\r\nTo the south of Lyons, in the city of Vienne, hand-weaving is\r\ndisappearing. “Shoddy” is now the leading produce, and twenty-eight\r\nconcerns only remain out of the 120 _fabriques_ which existed thirty\r\nyears ago. Old woollen rags, rags of carpets, and all the dust\r\nfrom the carding and spinning in the wool and cotton factories of\r\nNorthern France, with a small addition of cotton, are transformed\r\nhere into cloth which flows from Vienne to all the big cities of\r\nFrance--20,000 yards of “shoddy” every day--to supply the ready-made\r\nclothing factories. Hand-weaving has evidently nothing to do in that\r\nindustry, and in 1890 only 1,300 hand-looms were at work out of the\r\n4,000 which were in motion in 1870. Large factories, employing a\r\ntotal of 1,800 workers, have taken the place of these hand-weavers,\r\nwhile “shoddy” has taken the place of cloth. All sorts of flannels,\r\nfelt hats, tissues of horse-hair, and so on, are fabricated at the\r\nsame time. But while the great factory thus conquered the city of\r\nVienne, its suburbs and its nearest surroundings became the centre\r\nof a prosperous gardening and fruit culture, which has already been\r\nmentioned in chapter iv.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the Rhône, between Ampuis and Condrieu, are one of\r\nthe wealthiest parts of all France, owing to the shrubberies and\r\nnurseries, market-gardening, fruit-growing, vine-growing, and\r\ncheese-making out of goats’ milk. House industries go there hand in\r\nhand with an intelligent culture of the soil; Condrieu, for instance,\r\nis a famous centre for embroidery, which is made partly by hand, as\r\nof old, and partly by machinery.\r\n\r\nIn the west of Lyons, at l’Arbresles, factories have grown up for\r\nmaking silks and velvets; but a large part of the population still\r\ncontinue to weave in their houses; while farther west, Panissières is\r\nthe centre of quite a number of villages in which linen and silks are\r\nwoven as a domestic industry. Not all these workers own their houses,\r\nbut those, at least, who own or rent a small piece of land or garden,\r\nor keep a couple of cows, are said to be well off, and the land, as a\r\nrule, is said to be admirably cultivated by these weavers.\r\n\r\nThe chief industrial centre of this part of the Lyons region\r\nis certainly Tarare. At the time when Reybaud wrote his\r\nalready-mentioned work, _Le Coton_, it was a centre for the\r\nmanufacture of muslins and it occupied in this industry the same\r\nposition as Leeds formerly occupied in this country in the woollen\r\ncloth trade. The spinning mills and the large finishing factories\r\nwere at Tarare, while the weaving of the muslins and the embroidery\r\nof the same were made in the surrounding villages, especially in the\r\nhilly tracts of the Beaujolais and the Forez. Each peasant house,\r\neach farm and _métayerie_ were small workshops at that time, and\r\none could see, Reybaud wrote, the lad of twenty embroidering fine\r\nmuslin after he had finished cleaning the farm stables, without the\r\nwork suffering in its delicacy from a combination of two such varied\r\npursuits. On the contrary, the delicacy of the work and the extreme\r\nvariety of patterns were a distinctive feature of the Tarare muslins\r\nand a cause of their success. All testimonies agreed at the same time\r\nin recognising that, while agriculture found support in the industry,\r\nthe agricultural population enjoyed a relative well-being.\r\n\r\nBy this time the industry has undergone a thorough transformation,\r\nbut still no less than 60,000 persons, representing a population of\r\nabout 250,000 souls, work for Tarare in the hilly tracts, weaving all\r\nsorts of muslins for all parts of the world, and they earn every year\r\n£480,000 in this way.\r\n\r\nAmplepuis, notwithstanding its own factories of silks and blankets,\r\nremains one of the local centres for such muslins; while close by,\r\nThizy is a centre for a variety of linings, flannels, “peruvian\r\nserges,” “oxfords,” and other mixed woollen-and-cotton stuffs which\r\nare woven in the mountains by the peasants. No less than 3,000\r\nhand-looms are thus scattered in twenty-two villages, and about\r\n£600,000 worth of various stuffs are woven every year by the rural\r\nweavers in this neighbourhood alone; while 15,000 power-looms are at\r\nwork in both Thizy and the great city of Roanne, in which two towns\r\nall varieties of cottons (linings, flannelettes, apron cloth) and\r\nsilk blankets are woven in factories by the million yards.\r\n\r\nAt Cours, 1,600 workers are employed in making “blankets,” chiefly of\r\nthe lowest sort (even such as are sold at 2s. and even 10d. a piece,\r\nfor export to Brazil); all possible and imaginable rags and sweepings\r\nfrom all sorts of textile factories (jute, cotton, flax, hemp, wool\r\nand silk) are used for that industry, in which the factory is, of\r\ncourse, fully victorious. But even at Roanne, where the fabrication\r\nof cottons has attained a great degree of perfection and 9,000\r\npower-looms are at work, producing every year more than 30,000,000\r\nyards--even at Roanne one finds with astonishment that domestic\r\nindustries are not dead, but yield every year the respectable amount\r\nof more than 10,000,000 yards of stuffs. At the same time, in the\r\nneighbourhood of that big city the industry of fancy-knitting has\r\ntaken within the last thirty years a sudden development. Only 2,000\r\nwomen were employed in it in 1864, but their numbers were estimated\r\nby M. Dumazet at 20,000; and, without abandoning their rural work,\r\nthey find time to knit, with the aid of small knitting-machines, all\r\nsorts of fancy articles in wool, the annual value of which, attains\r\n£360,000.[165]\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought, however, that textiles and connected trades\r\nare the only small industries in this locality. Scores of various\r\nrural industries continue to exist besides, and in nearly all of\r\nthem the methods of production are continually improved. Thus, when\r\nthe rural making of plain chairs became unprofitable, articles of\r\nluxury and stylish chairs began to be fabricated in the villages, and\r\nsimilar transformations are found everywhere.\r\n\r\nMore details about this extremely interesting region will be\r\nfound in the Appendix, but one remark must be made in this place.\r\nNotwithstanding its big industries and coal mines, this part of\r\nFrance has entirely maintained its rural aspect, and is now one\r\nof the best cultivated parts of the country. What most deserves\r\nadmiration is--not so much the development of the great industries,\r\nwhich, after all, here as elsewhere, are to a great extent\r\ninternational in their origins--as the creative and inventive powers\r\nand capacities of adaptation which appear amongst the great mass of\r\nthese industrious populations. At every step, in the field, in the\r\ngarden, in the orchard, in the dairy, in the industrial arts, in the\r\nhundreds of small inventions in these arts, one sees the creative\r\ngenius of the folk. In these regions one best understands why France,\r\ntaking the mass of its population, is considered the richest country\r\nof Europe.[166]\r\n\r\nThe chief centre for petty trades in France is, however, Paris. There\r\nwe find, by the side of the large factories, the greatest variety\r\nof petty trades for the fabrication of goods of every description,\r\nboth for the home market and for export. The petty trades at Paris so\r\nmuch prevail over the factories that the average number of workmen\r\nemployed in the 98,000 factories and workshops of Paris is less than\r\n_six_, while the number of persons employed in workshops which have\r\nless than five operatives is almost twice as big as the number of\r\npersons employed in the larger establishments.[167] In fact, Paris\r\nis a great bee-hive where hundreds of thousands of men and women\r\nfabricate in small workshops all possible varieties of goods which\r\nrequire skill, taste and invention. These small workshops, in which\r\nartistic finish and rapidity of work are so much praised, necessarily\r\nstimulate the mental powers of the producers; and we may safely\r\nadmit that if the Paris workmen are generally considered, and really\r\nare, more developed intellectually than the workers of any other\r\nEuropean capital, this is due to a great extent to the character of\r\nthe work they are engaged in--a work which implies artistic taste,\r\nskill, and especially inventiveness, always wide awake in order\r\nto invent new patterns of goods and steadily to increase and to\r\nperfect the technical methods of production. It also appears very\r\nprobable that if we find a highly developed working population in\r\nVienna and Warsaw, this depends again to a very great extent upon\r\nthe very considerable development of similar small industries, which\r\nstimulate invention and so much contribute to develop the worker’s\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nThe _Galerie du travail_ at the Paris exhibitions is always a most\r\nremarkable sight. One can appreciate in it both the variety of the\r\nsmall industries which are carried on in French towns and the skill\r\nand inventing powers of the workers. And the question necessarily\r\narises: Must all this skill, all this intelligence, be swept\r\naway by the factory, instead of becoming a new fertile source of\r\nprogress under a better organisation of production? must all this\r\nindependence and inventiveness of the worker disappear before the\r\nfactory levelling? and, if it must, would such a transformation be a\r\nprogress, as so many economists who have only studied figures and not\r\nhuman beings are ready to maintain?\r\n\r\nAt anyrate, it is quite certain that even if the absorption of the\r\nFrench petty trades by the big factories were possible--which seems\r\nextremely doubtful--the absorption would not be accomplished so soon\r\nas that. The small industry of Paris fights hard for its maintenance,\r\nand it shows its vitality by the numberless machine-tools which are\r\ncontinually invented by the workers for improving and cheapening the\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of motors which were exhibited at the last exhibitions in\r\nthe _Galerie du travail_ bear a testimony to the fact that a cheap\r\nmotor, for the small industry, is one of the leading problems of the\r\nday. Motors weighing only forty-five lb., including the boiler, were\r\nexhibited in 1889 to answer that want. Small two-horse-power engines,\r\nfabricated by the engineers of the Jura (formerly watch-makers) in\r\ntheir small workshops, were at that time another attempt to solve the\r\nproblem--to say nothing of the water, gas and electrical motors.[168]\r\nThe transmission of steam-power to 230 small workshops which was made\r\nby the _Société des Immeubles industriels_ was another attempt in the\r\nsame direction, and the increasing efforts of the French engineers\r\nfor finding out the best means of transmitting and subdividing power\r\nby means of compressed air, “tele-dynamic cables,” and electricity\r\nare indicative of the endeavours of the small industry to retain its\r\nground in the face of the competition of the factories. (See Appendix\r\nV.)\r\n\r\nSuch are the small industries in France, as they have been described\r\nby observers who saw them on the spot. Is is, however, most\r\ninteresting to have exact statistical items concerning the extension\r\nof the small industries, and to know their importance, in comparison\r\nwith the great industry. Fortunately enough, a general census of the\r\nFrench industries was made in the year 1896; its results have been\r\npublished in full, under the title of _Résultats statistiques du\r\nrecensement des industries et des professions_, and in the fourth\r\nvolume of this capital work we find an excellent summing up of the\r\nmain results of the census, written by M. Lucien March. I give a\r\n_résumé_ of these results in the Appendix, as otherwise I should have\r\nbeen compelled, in speaking of the distribution of great and small\r\nindustry in France, to repeat very much what I have said in this same\r\nchapter, speaking of the United Kingdom. There is so much in common\r\nin the distribution of small and large factories in the different\r\nbranches of industry in both countries that it would have been a\r\ntedious repetition. So I give here only the main items and refer the\r\nreader to Appendix W.\r\n\r\nThe general distribution of the workers’ population in large,\r\nmiddle-sized, and small factories in the year 1896 was as follows.\r\nFirst of all there was the great division of independent artisans\r\nwho worked single-handed, and working men and women who were without\r\npermanent employment on the day of the census. Part of this large\r\ndivision belongs to agriculture; but, after having deducted the\r\nagricultural establishments, M. March arrives at the figures of\r\n483,000 establishments belonging to this category in industry, and\r\n1,047,000 persons of both sexes working in these establishments, or\r\ntemporarily attached to some industrial establishment. To these we\r\nmust add 37,705 industrial establishments, where no hired workmen are\r\nemployed, but the head of the establishment works with the aid of\r\nthe members of his own family. We have thus, in these two divisions,\r\nabout 520,700 establishments and 1,084,700 persons which I inscribe\r\nin the following table under the head of “No hired operatives.” The\r\ntable then appears as follows:--\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------+---------------+--------------------+\r\n  |                             |   Number of   |Number of operatives|\r\n  |                             |establishments.|     and clerks.    |\r\n  +-----------------------------+---------------+--------------------+\r\n  |    No hired operatives      |    520,700    |      1,084,700     |\r\n  +-----------------------------+---------------+--------------------+\r\n  | From 1 to 10 employees      |    539,449    |      1,134,700     |\r\n  | From 11 to 50    ”          |     28,626    |        585,000     |\r\n  | From 51 to 100   ”          |      3,865    |        268,000     |\r\n  | From 101 to 500  ”          |      3,145    |        616,000     |\r\n  | From 501 to 1000 ”          |        295    |        195,000     |\r\n  | More than 1000   ”          |        149    |        313,000     |\r\n  +-----------------------------+---------------+--------------------+\r\n  |                             |    575,529    |      3,111,700     |\r\n  |                             +---------------+--------------------+\r\n  | Total (with first division).|  1,096,229    |      4,196,400     |\r\n  +-----------------------------+---------------+--------------------+\r\n\r\nThese figures speak for themselves and show what an immense\r\nimportance the small industry has in France. More details, showing\r\nthe distribution of the great, middle-sized and small industry in\r\ndifferent branches will be found in the Appendix, and there the\r\nreader will also see what a striking resemblance is offered under\r\nthis aspect by the industry of France and that of the United Kingdom.\r\nIn the next chapter it will be seen from a similar census that\r\nGermany stands in absolutely the same position.\r\n\r\nIt would have been very interesting to compare the present\r\ndistribution of industries in France with what it was previously.\r\nBut M. Lucien March tells us that “_no statistics previous to 1896\r\nhave given us a knowledge of that distribution_.” Still, an inquest\r\nmade between 1840 and 1845, and which M. March considers “very\r\ncomplete for the more important establishments which employed more\r\nthan fifty workmen,” was worked out by him, and he found that such\r\nestablishments numbered 3,300 in 1840; in 1896 they had already\r\nattained the number of 7,400, and they occupied more than fifty-five\r\nper cent. of all the workpeople employed in industry. As to the\r\nestablishments which employed more than 500 persons and which\r\nnumbered 133 in 1840 (six per cent. of all the workpeople), they\r\nattained the number of 444 in 1896, and sixteen per cent. of all the\r\nworkpeople were employed in them.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion to be drawn from these facts is thus worded by\r\nM. March: “To sum up, during the last fifty years a notable\r\nconcentration of the factories took place in the big establishments;\r\nbut the just-mentioned results, supported by the statistics of the\r\npatents, permit us to recognise that _this concentration does not\r\nprevent the maintenance of a mass of small enterprises, the average\r\nsizes of which increase but very slowly_.” This last is, in fact,\r\nwhat we have just seen from our brief sketch for the United Kingdom,\r\nand we can only ask ourselves whether--such being the facts--the\r\nword “concentration” is well chosen. What we see in reality is, the\r\nappearance, _in some branches of industry_, of a certain number of\r\nlarge establishments, and especially of middle-sized factories. But\r\nthis does not prevent in the least that very great numbers of small\r\nfactories should continue to exist, either in other branches, or\r\nin the very same branches where large factories have appeared (the\r\ntextiles, work in metal), or in branches connected with the main\r\nones, which take their origin in these main ones, as the industry of\r\nclothing takes its origin from that of the textiles.\r\n\r\nThis is the only conclusion which a serious analysis permits\r\nus to draw from the facts brought to light by the census of\r\n1896 and subsequent observations. As to the large deductions\r\nabout “concentration” made by certain economists, they are mere\r\n_hypotheses_--useful, of course, for stimulating research, but\r\nbecoming quite noxious when they are represented _as economical\r\nlaws_, when in reality they are not confirmed at all by the testimony\r\nof carefully observed facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[129] This is why the German economists find such difficulties\r\nin delimiting the proper domain of the domestic trades\r\n(_Hausindustrie_), and now identify this word with _Verlagssystem_,\r\nwhich means “working either directly or through the intermediary of\r\na middleman employer (or buyer) for a dealer or employer, who pays\r\nthe small producer for the goods he has produced, before they have\r\nreached the consumer.”\r\n\r\n[130] For more details about this subject, see an article of mine in\r\nthe _Nineteenth Century_, August, 1900.\r\n\r\n[131] The Chief Inspector, Mr. Whitelegge, wrote to me in 1900 that\r\nthe workshops which did not enter into his reports represented about\r\none-half of all the workshops. Since that time Mr. Whitelegge has\r\ncontinued to publish his interesting reports, adding to them new\r\ngroups of workshops. However, they still remain incomplete to some\r\nextent as regards this last point. In the last Report, published\r\nin 1911, we see that 147,000 workshops were registered at the\r\nend of 1907, and returns were received from 105,000 of them. But\r\nas in 32,000 workshops no women or young persons (below 18) were\r\nemployed, their returns were not published. The Report for 1907\r\ngives, therefore, only 91,249 workshops in which 638,335 persons\r\nwere employed (186,064 male and 282,324 female adults, 54,605 male\r\nand 113,728 female young persons--that is, full-timers from 14 to 18\r\nyears old--and 863 male and 751 female children under 14).\r\n\r\n[132] From the curve that I computed it appears that all the textile\r\nfactories are distributed as to their size as follows:--Not less than\r\n500 operatives, 200 factories, 203,100 operatives; from 499 to 200,\r\n660 factories, 231,000 operatives; from 199 to 100, 2,955 factories,\r\n443,120 operatives; from 99 to 50, 1,380 factories, 103,500\r\noperatives; less than 50, 1,410 factories, 42,300 operatives; total,\r\n6,605 factories, 1,022,020 operatives.--_Nineteenth Century_, August,\r\n1900, p. 262.\r\n\r\n[133] Nearly one-half of the 43,000 operatives who were employed\r\nat that time in the woollen trade of this country were weaving in\r\nhand-looms. So also one-fifth of the 79,000 persons employed in the\r\nworsted trade.\r\n\r\n[134] E.

M. Thun and Prof.\r\nIssaieff, on behalf of the Russian Petty Trades Commission, Emanuel\r\nHans Sax, Paul Voigt, and very many others. By this time the subject\r\nhas a bulky literature, and such impressive and suggestive pictures\r\nhave been drawn from life for different regions and trades that I\r\nfelt tempted to sum up these life-true descriptions. However, as in\r\nsuch a summary I should have to repeat much of what has already been\r\nsaid and illustrated in the preceding chapter, it will probably more\r\ninterest the general reader to know something about the conclusions\r\nwhich can be drawn from the works of the German investigators,[169]\r\nand to know the conclusions that may be drawn from the three censuses\r\nof industries which have been made in Germany in the years 1882,\r\n1895, and 1907. This is what I am going to do.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, the discussion upon this important subject has often\r\ntaken in Germany a passionate and even a personally aggressive\r\ncharacter.[170] On the one hand the ultra-conservative elements of\r\nGerman politics tried, and succeeded to some extent, in making of the\r\npetty trades and the domestic industries an arm for securing a return\r\nto the “olden good times.” They even passed a law intended to prepare\r\na re-introduction of the old-fashioned, closed and patriarchal\r\ncorporations which could be placed under the close supervision and\r\ntutorship of the State, and they saw in such a law a weapon against\r\nsocial democracy. On the other hand, the social democrats, justly\r\nopposed to such measures, but themselves inclined, in their turn, to\r\ntake too abstract a view of economical questions, bitterly attack all\r\nthose who do not merely repeat the stereotyped phrases to the effect\r\nthat “the petty trades are in decay,” and “the sooner they disappear\r\nthe better,” as they will give room to capitalist centralisation,\r\nwhich, according to the social democratic creed, “will soon achieve\r\nits own ruin.” In this dislike of the small industries they are, of\r\ncourse, at one with the economists of the orthodox school, whom they\r\ncombat on nearly all other points.[171]\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions, the polemics about the petty trades and the\r\ndomestic industries are evidently doomed to remain most unproductive.\r\nHowever, it is pleasant to see that a considerable amount of most\r\nconscientious work has been made for the investigation of the\r\npetty trades in Germany; and, by the side of such monographs, from\r\nwhich nothing can be learned but that the petty trades’ workers\r\nare in a miserable condition, and nothing whatever can be gathered\r\nto explain why these workers prefer their conditions to those of\r\nfactory hands--there is no lack of very detailed monographs (such as\r\nthose of Thun, Em. H. Sax, Paul Voigt on the Berlin cabinet-makers,\r\netc.), in which one sees the whole of the life of these classes of\r\nworkers, the difficulties which they have to cope with, and the\r\ntechnical conditions of the trade, and finds all the elements for an\r\nindependent judgment upon the matter.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a number of petty trades are already now doomed\r\nto disappear; but there are others, on the contrary, which are\r\nendowed with a great vitality, and all chances are in favour of their\r\ncontinuing to exist and to take a further development for many years\r\nto come. In the fabrication of such textiles as are woven by millions\r\nof yards, and can be best produced with the aid of a complicated\r\nmachinery, the competition of the hand-loom against the power-loom is\r\nevidently nothing but a survival, which may be maintained for some\r\ntime by certain local conditions, but finally must die away.\r\n\r\nThe same is true with regard to many branches of the iron industries,\r\nhardware fabrication, pottery, and so on. But wherever the direct\r\nintervention of taste and inventiveness are required, wherever new\r\npatterns of goods requiring a continual renewal of machinery and\r\ntools must continually be introduced in order to feed the demand, as\r\nis the case with all fancy textiles, even though they be fabricated\r\nto supply the millions; wherever a great variety of goods and the\r\nuninterrupted invention of new ones goes on, as is the case in the\r\ntoy trade, in instrument making, watch-making, bicycle making, and\r\nso on; and finally, wherever the artistic feeling of the individual\r\nworker makes the best part of his goods, as is the case in hundreds\r\nof branches of small articles of luxury, there is a wide field for\r\npetty trades, rural workshops, domestic industries, and the like.\r\nMore fresh air, more ideas, more general conceptions, and more\r\nco-operation are evidently required in those industries. But where\r\nthe spirit of initiative has been awakened in one way or another, we\r\nsee the petty industries taking a new development in Germany, as we\r\nhave just seen that being done in France.\r\n\r\nNow, in nearly all the petty trades in Germany, the position of\r\nthe workers is unanimously described as most miserable, and the\r\nmany admirers of centralisation which we find in Germany always\r\ninsist upon this misery in order to predict, and to call for, the\r\ndisappearance of “those mediæval survivals” which “capitalist\r\ncentralisation” must supplant for the benefit of the worker. The\r\nreality is, however, that when we compare the miserable conditions\r\nof the workers in the petty trades with the conditions of the wage\r\nworkers in the factories, in the same regions and in the same trades,\r\nwe see that the very same misery prevails among the factory workers.\r\nThey live upon wages of from nine to eleven shillings a week, in town\r\nslums instead of the country. They work eleven hours a day, and they\r\nalso are subject to the extra misery thrown upon them during the\r\nfrequently recurring crises. It is only after they have undergone all\r\nsorts of sufferings in their struggles against their employers that\r\nsome factory workers succeed, more or less, here and there, to wrest\r\nfrom their employers a “living wage”--and this again only in certain\r\ntrades.\r\n\r\nTo welcome all these sufferings, seeing in them the action of\r\na “natural law” and a _necessary_ step towards the _necessary_\r\nconcentration of industry, would be simply absurd. While to maintain\r\nthat the pauperisation of all workers and the wreckage of all village\r\nindustries are a _necessary_ step towards a higher form of industrial\r\norganisation would be, not only to affirm much more than one is\r\nentitled to affirm under the present imperfect state of economical\r\nknowledge, but to show an absolute want of comprehension of the sense\r\nof both natural and economic laws. Everyone, on the contrary, who has\r\nstudied the question of the growth of great industries on its own\r\nmerits, will undoubtedly agree with Thorold Rogers, who considered\r\nthe sufferings inflicted upon the labouring classes for that purpose\r\nas having been of _no necessity whatever_, and simply having been\r\ninflicted to suit the temporary interests of the few--by no means\r\nthose of the nation.[172]\r\n\r\nMoreover, everyone knows to what extent the labour of children and\r\ngirls is resorted to, even in the most prosperous factories--even\r\nin this country which stands foremost in industrial development.\r\nSome figures relative to this subject were given in the preceding\r\nchapter. And this fact is not an accident which might be easily\r\nremoved, as Maurice Block--a great admirer, of course, of the\r\nfactory system--tries to represent it.[173] The low wages paid to\r\nchildren and youths are now one of the _necessary_ elements in the\r\ncheapness of the factory produced textiles, and, consequently, of\r\nthe very competition of the factory with the petty trades. I have\r\nmentioned besides, whilst speaking of France, what are the effects\r\nof “concentrated” industries upon village life; and in Thun’s work,\r\nand in many others as well, one may find enough of ghastly instances\r\nof what are the effects of accumulations of girls in the factories.\r\nTo idealise the modern factory, in order to depreciate the so-called\r\n“mediæval” forms of the small industries, is consequently--to say the\r\nleast--as unreasonable as to idealise the latter and try to bring\r\nmankind back to isolated home-spinning and home-weaving in every\r\npeasant house.\r\n\r\nOne fact dominates all the investigations which have been made into\r\nthe conditions of the small industries. We find it in Germany, as\r\nwell as in France or in Russia. In an immense number of trades it\r\nis not the superiority of the _technical_ organisation of the trade\r\nin a factory, nor the economies realised on the prime-motor, which\r\nmilitate against the small industry in favour of the factories,\r\nbut the more advantageous conditions for _selling_ the produce\r\nand for _buying_ the raw produce which are at the disposal of big\r\nconcerns. Wherever this difficulty has been overcome, either by\r\nmeans of association, or in consequence of a market being secured\r\nfor the sale of the produce, it has always been found--first, that\r\nthe conditions of the workers or artisans immediately improved; and\r\nnext, that a rapid progress was realised in the technical aspects of\r\nthe respective industries. New processes were introduced to improve\r\nthe produce or to increase the rapidity of its fabrication; new\r\nmachine-tools were invented; or new motors were resorted to; or the\r\ntrade was reorganised so as to diminish the costs of production.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, wherever the helpless, isolated artisans and\r\nworkers continue to remain at the mercy of the wholesale buyers, who\r\nalways--since Adam Smith’s time--“openly or tacitly” agree to act as\r\none man to bring down the prices almost to a starvation level--and\r\nsuch is the case for the immense number of the small and village\r\nindustries--their condition is so bad that only the longing of the\r\nworkers after a certain relative independence, and their knowledge of\r\nwhat awaits them in the factory, prevent them from joining the ranks\r\nof the factory hands. Knowing that in most cases the advent of the\r\nfactory would mean no work at all for most men, and the taking of the\r\nchildren and girls to the factory, they do the utmost to prevent it\r\nfrom appearing at all in the village.\r\n\r\nAs to combinations in the villages, co-operation and the like, one\r\nmust never forget how jealously the German, the French, the Russian\r\nand the Austrian Governments have hitherto prevented the workers,\r\n_and especially the village workers_, from entering into any sort of\r\ncombination for economical purposes. In France the peasant syndicates\r\nwere permitted only by the law of 1884. To keep the peasant at the\r\nlowest possible level, by means of taxation, serfdom, and the like,\r\nhas been, and is still, the policy of most continental States. It\r\nwas only in 1876 that some extension of the association rights was\r\ngranted in Germany, and even now a mere co-operative association\r\nfor the sale of the artisans’ work is soon reported as a “political\r\nassociation” and submitted as such to the usual limitations, such as\r\nthe exclusion of women and the like.[174] A striking example of that\r\npolicy as regards a village association was given by Prof. Issaieff,\r\nwho also mentioned the severe measures taken by the wholesale buyers\r\nin the toy trade to prevent the workers from entering into direct\r\nintercourse with foreign buyers.\r\n\r\nWhen one examines with more than a superficial attention the life\r\nof the small industries and their struggles for life, one sees\r\nthat when they perish, they perish--not because “an economy can be\r\nrealised by using a hundred horse-power motor, instead of a hundred\r\nsmall motors”--this inconveniency never fails to be mentioned,\r\nalthough it is easily obviated in Sheffield, in Paris, and many\r\nother places by hiring workshops with wheel-power, supplied by\r\na central machine, and, still more, as was so truly observed by\r\nProf. W. Unwin, by the electric transmission of power. They do not\r\nperish because a substantial economy can be realised in the factory\r\nproduction--in many more cases than is usually supposed, the fact\r\nis even the reverse--but because the capitalist who establishes a\r\nfactory emancipates himself from the wholesale and retail dealers in\r\nraw materials; and especially, because he emancipates himself from\r\nthe buyers of his produce and can deal directly with the wholesale\r\nbuyer and exporter; or else he concentrates in one concern the\r\ndifferent stages of fabrication of a given produce. The pages which\r\nSchulze-Gäwernitz gave to the organisation of the cotton industry in\r\nEngland, and to the difficulties which the German cotton-mill owners\r\nhad to contend with, so long as they were dependent upon Liverpool\r\nfor raw cotton, are most instructive in this direction. And what\r\ncharacterises the cotton trade prevails in all other industries as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nIf the Sheffield cutlers who now work in their tiny workshops, in\r\none of the above-mentioned buildings supplied with wheel-power,\r\nwere incorporated in one big factory, the chief advantage which\r\nwould be realised in the factory would _not_ be an economy in the\r\ncosts of production, in comparison to the quality of the produce;\r\nwith a shareholders’ company the costs might even increase. And yet\r\nthe profits (including wages) probably would be greater than the\r\naggregate earnings of the workers, in consequence of the reduced\r\ncosts of purchase of iron and coal, and the facilities for the sale\r\nof the produce. The great concern would thus find its advantages not\r\nin such factors as are imposed by the _technical_ necessities of the\r\ntrade at the time being, but in such factors as could be eliminated\r\nby co-operative organisation. All these are elementary notions among\r\npractical men.\r\n\r\nIt hardly need be added that a further advantage which the factory\r\nowner has is, that he can find a sale even for produce of the most\r\ninferior quality, provided there is a considerable quantity of it to\r\nbe sold. All those who are acquainted with commerce know, indeed,\r\nwhat an immense bulk of the world’s trade consists of “shoddy,”\r\n_patraque_, “Red Indians’ blankets,” and the like, shipped to distant\r\ncountries. Whole cities--we just saw--produce nothing but “shoddy.”\r\n\r\nAltogether, it may be taken as one of the fundamental facts of the\r\neconomical life of Europe that the defeat of a number of small\r\ntrades, artisan work and domestic industries, came through their\r\nbeing incapable of organising the _sale_ of their produce--not from\r\nthe _production_ itself. The same thing recurs at every page of\r\neconomical history. The incapacity of organising the sale, without\r\nbeing enslaved by the merchant, was the leading feature of the\r\nMediæval cities, which gradually fell under the economical and\r\npolitical yoke of the Guild-Merchant, _simply because they were not\r\nable to maintain the sale of their manufactures by the community as\r\na whole_, or to organise the sale of a new produce in the interest\r\nof the community. When the markets for such commodities came to be\r\nAsia on the one side, and the New World on the other side, such was\r\nfatally the case; since commerce had ceased to be _communal_, and had\r\nbecome _individual_, the cities became a prey for the rivalries of\r\nthe chief merchant families.\r\n\r\nEven nowadays, when we see the co-operative societies beginning to\r\nsucceed in their productive workshops, while fifty years ago they\r\ninvariably failed in their capacity of producers, we may conclude\r\nthat the cause of their previous failures was not in their incapacity\r\nof properly and economically organising _production_, but in their\r\ninability of acting as _sellers_ and exporters of the produce they\r\nhad fabricated. Their present successes, on the contrary, are fully\r\naccounted for by the network of distributive societies which they\r\nhave at their command. The sale has been simplified, and production\r\nhas been rendered possible _by first organising the market_.\r\n\r\nSuch are a few conclusions which may be drawn from a study of the\r\nsmall industries in Germany and elsewhere. And it may be safely\r\nsaid, with regard to Germany, that if measures are not taken for\r\ndriving the peasants from the land on the same scale as they have\r\nbeen taken in this country; if, on the contrary, the numbers of\r\nsmall landholders multiply, they necessarily will turn to various\r\nsmall trades, in addition to agriculture, as they have done, and are\r\ndoing, in France. Every step that may be taken, either for awakening\r\nintellectual life in the villages, or for assuring the peasants’ or\r\nthe country’s rights upon the land, will necessarily further the\r\ngrowth of industries in the villages.\r\n\r\nIn this light it is extremely interesting to see the figures as to\r\nthe distribution of the German industries into a small, middle-sized,\r\nand great industry, which are given by three industrial censuses\r\ntaken during the last thirty years. But for these figures I refer the\r\nreader to the Appendix.[175]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Petty Trades in other Countries._\r\n\r\nIf it were worth extending our inquiry to other countries, we\r\nshould find a vast field for most interesting observations in\r\nSwitzerland. There we should see the same vitality in a variety\r\nof petty industries, and we could mention what has been done in\r\nthe different cantons for maintaining the small trades by three\r\ndifferent sets of measures: the extension of co-operation; a wide\r\nextension of technical education in the schools and the introduction\r\nof new branches of semi-artistic production in different parts of\r\nthe country; and the supply of cheap motive power in the houses by\r\nmeans of a hydraulic or an electric transmission of power borrowed\r\nfrom the waterfalls. A separate book of the greatest interest and\r\nvalue could be written on this subject, especially on the impulse\r\ngiven to a number of petty trades, old and new, by means of a cheap\r\nsupply of motive power. Such a book would also offer a great interest\r\nin that it would show to what an extent that mingling together of\r\nagriculture with industry, which I described in the first edition\r\nof this book as “the factory amidst the fields,” has progressed of\r\nlate in Switzerland. It strikes at the present time even the casual\r\ntraveller.[176]\r\n\r\nBelgium would offer an equal interest. Belgium is certainly a country\r\nof centralised industry, and a country in which the productivity of\r\nthe worker stands at a high level, the average annual productivity\r\nof each industrial workman--men, women, and children--attaining\r\nnow the high figure of at least £250 per head. Coal mines in which\r\nmore than a thousand workers are employed are numerous, and there\r\nis a fair number of textile factories in each of which from 300 to\r\n700 workers are occupied. And yet, if we exclude from the industrial\r\nworkers’ population of Belgium, which numbered 823,920 persons in\r\n1896 (1,102,240 with the clerks, travellers, supervisors and so\r\non), the 116,300 workpeople who are employed in the coal mines, and\r\nnearly 165,000 artisans working single or with the aid of their\r\nfamilies, we find that out of the remaining 565,200 workers very\r\nnearly one-half--that is, 270,200 persons--work in establishments\r\nin which less than fifty persons are employed, while 95,000 persons\r\nout of these last are employed in 54,500 workshops, which thus have\r\nan average of less than three workers per workshop.[177] We may thus\r\nsay that--taking the mines out of account--more than one-sixth part\r\nof the Belgian industrial workers are employed in small workshops\r\nwhich have, on the average, less than three workers each, besides\r\nthe master, and that four-tenths of all the workpeople are employed\r\nin factories and workshops having on the average less than thirteen\r\nworkpeople each.[178]\r\n\r\nWhat is still more remarkable is, that the number of small workshops,\r\nin which from one to four aids only are employed by the master,\r\nattains the considerable figure of 1,867 (2,293 in 1880) in the\r\ntextile industries, notwithstanding the high concentration of a\r\ncertain portion[179] of these industries. As to the machinery works\r\nand hardware trades, the small workshops in which the master works\r\nwith from two to four assistants or journeymen are very numerous\r\n(more than 13,300), to say nothing of the gun trade which is a petty\r\ntrade _par excellence_, and the furniture trade which has lately\r\ntaken a great development. A highly concentrated industry, and a\r\nhigh productivity, as well as a considerable export trade, which all\r\ntestify to a high industrial development of the country, thus go hand\r\nin hand with a high development of the domestic trades and small\r\nindustries altogether.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt hardly need be said that in Austria, Hungary, Italy, and even the\r\nUnited States, the petty trades occupy a prominent position, and play\r\nin the sum total of industrial activity an even much greater part\r\nthan in France, Belgium, or Germany. But it is especially in Russia\r\nthat we can fully appreciate the importance of the rural industries\r\nand the terrible sufferings which will be quite uselessly inflicted\r\non the population, if the policy of the State is going to be now the\r\npolicy advocated by a number of landlords and factory-owners--namely,\r\nif the State throws its tremendous weight in favour of a\r\npauperisation of the peasants and an artificial annihilation of the\r\nrural trades, in order to create a centralised great industry.[180]\r\n\r\nThe most exhaustive inquiries into the present state, the growth,\r\nthe technical development of the rural industries, and the\r\ndifficulties they have to contend with, have been made in Russia.\r\nA house-to-house inquiry which embraces nearly 1,000,000 peasants’\r\nhouses has been made in various provinces of Russia, and its results\r\nalready represent 450 volumes, printed by different county councils\r\n(_Zemstvos_). Besides, in the fifteen volumes published by the Petty\r\nTrades Committee, and still more in the publications of the Moscow\r\nStatistical Committee, and of many provincial assemblies, we find\r\nexhaustive lists giving the name of each worker, the extent and the\r\nstate of his fields, his live stock, the value of his agricultural\r\nand industrial production, his earnings from both sources, and his\r\nyearly budget; while hundreds of separate trades have been described\r\nin separate monographs from the technical, economical, and sanitary\r\npoints of view.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained from these inquiries were really imposing, as\r\nit appeared that out of the 80 or 90 million population of European\r\nRussia proper, no less than 7,500,000 persons were engaged in the\r\ndomestic trades, and that their production reached, at the lowest\r\nestimate, more than £150,000,000, and most probably £200,000,000\r\n(2,000,000,000 roubles) every year.[181] It thus exceeded the total\r\nproduction of the great industry. As to the relative importance of\r\nthe two for the working classes suffice it to say that even in the\r\ngovernment of Moscow, which is the chief manufacturing region of\r\nRussia (its factories yield upwards of one-fifth in value of the\r\naggregate industrial production of European Russia), the aggregate\r\nincomes derived by the population from the domestic industries are\r\nthree times larger than the aggregate wages earned in the factories.\r\n\r\nThe most striking feature of the Russian domestic trades is that\r\nthe sudden start which was made by the factories in Russia did not\r\nprejudice the domestic industries. On the contrary, it gave a new\r\nimpulse to their extension; they grew and developed precisely in\r\nthose regions where the factories were growing up fastest.\r\n\r\nAnother most suggestive feature is the following: although the\r\nunfertile provinces of Central Russia have been from time immemorial\r\nthe seat of all kinds of petty trades, several domestic industries\r\nof modern origin are developing in those provinces which are best\r\nfavoured by soil and climate. Thus, the Stavropol government of\r\nNorth Caucasus, where the peasantry have plenty of fertile soil, has\r\nsuddenly become the seat of a widely developed silk-weaving industry\r\nin the peasants’ houses, and now it supplies Russia with cheap silks\r\nwhich have completely expelled from the market the plain silks\r\nformerly imported from France. In Orenburg and on the Black Sea, the\r\npetty trades’ fabrication of agricultural machinery, which has grown\r\nup lately, is another instance in point.\r\n\r\nThe capacities of the Russian domestic industrial workers for\r\nco-operative organisation would be worthy of more than a passing\r\nmention. As to the cheapness of the produce manufactured in the\r\nvillages, which is really astonishing, it cannot be explained in full\r\nby the exceedingly long hours of labour and the starvation earnings,\r\nbecause overwork and very low wages are characteristic of the Russian\r\nfactories as well. It depends also upon the circumstance that the\r\npeasant who grows his own food, but suffers from a constant want\r\nof money, sells the produce of his industrial labour at any price.\r\nTherefore, all manufactured goods used by the Russian peasantry, save\r\nthe printed cottons, are the production of the rural manufacturers.\r\nBut many articles of luxury, too, are made in the villages,\r\nespecially around Moscow, by peasants who continue to cultivate their\r\nallotments. The silk hats which are sold in the best Moscow shops,\r\nand bear the stamp of _Nouveautés Parisiennes_, are made by the\r\nMoscow peasants; so also the “Vienna” furniture of the best “Vienna”\r\nshops, even if it goes to supply the palaces. And what is most to be\r\nwondered at is not the skill of the peasants--agricultural work is no\r\nobstacle to acquiring industrial skill--but the rapidity with which\r\nthe fabrication of fine goods has spread in such villages as formerly\r\nmanufactured only goods of the roughest description.[182]\r\n\r\nAs to the relations between agriculture and industry, one cannot\r\nperuse the documents accumulated by the Russian statisticians without\r\ncoming to the conclusion that, far from damaging agriculture, the\r\ndomestic trades, on the contrary, are the best means for improving\r\nit, and the more so, as for several months every year the Russian\r\npeasant has nothing to do in the fields. There are regions where\r\nagriculture has been totally abandoned for the industries; but\r\nthese are regions where it was rendered impossible by the very\r\nsmall allotments granted to the liberated serfs, the bad quality\r\nor the want of meadows in the land allotted to the peasants, and by\r\nthe general impoverishment of the peasants, following a very high\r\ntaxation and very high redemption taxes for the land. But wherever\r\nthe allotments are reasonable and the peasants are less over-taxed,\r\nthey continue to cultivate the land, and their fields are kept in\r\nbetter order; besides, the average numbers of live stock are higher\r\nwhere agriculture is carried on in association with the domestic\r\ntrades. Even those peasants whose allotments are small, find the\r\nmeans of renting more land if they earn some money from their\r\nindustrial work. As to the relative welfare, I need hardly add that\r\nit always stands on the side of those villages which combine both\r\nkinds of work. Vorsma and Pavlovo--two cutlery villages, one of which\r\nis purely industrial, while the inhabitants of the other continue\r\nto till the soil--could be quoted as a striking instance for such a\r\ncomparison.[183]\r\n\r\nMuch more ought to be said with regard to the rural industries\r\nof Russia, especially to show how easily the peasants associate\r\nfor buying new machinery, or for avoiding the middleman in their\r\npurchases of raw produce--as soon as misery is no obstacle to the\r\nassociation. Belgium, and especially Switzerland, could also be\r\nquoted for similar illustrations, but the above will be enough to\r\ngive a general idea of the importance, the vital powers, and the\r\nperfectibility of the rural industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusions._\r\n\r\nThe facts which we have briefly passed in review show, to some\r\nextent, the benefits which could be derived from a combination of\r\nagriculture with industry, if the latter could come to the village,\r\nnot in its present shape of a capitalist factory, but in the shape\r\nof a socially organised industrial production, with the full aid\r\nof machinery and technical knowledge. In fact, the most prominent\r\nfeature of the petty trades is that a relative well-being is found\r\nonly where they are combined with agriculture: where the workers\r\nhave remained in possession of the soil and continue to cultivate\r\nit. Even amidst the weavers of France or Moscow, who have to reckon\r\nwith the competition of the factory, relative well-being prevails\r\nso long as they are not compelled to part with the soil. On the\r\ncontrary, as soon as high taxation or the impoverishment during a\r\ncrisis has compelled the domestic worker to abandon his last plot of\r\nland to the usurer, misery creeps into his house. The sweater becomes\r\nall-powerful, frightful overwork is resorted to, and the whole trade\r\noften falls into decay.\r\n\r\nSuch facts, as well as the pronounced tendency of the factories\r\ntowards migrating to the villages, which becomes more and more\r\napparent nowadays, and found of late its expression in the ‘Garden\r\nCities’ movement, are very suggestive. Of course, it would be a\r\ngreat mistake to imagine that industry ought to return to its\r\nhand-work stage in order to be combined with agriculture. Whenever\r\na saving of human labour can be obtained by means of a machine, the\r\nmachine is welcome and will be resorted to; and there is hardly one\r\nsingle branch of industry into which machinery work could not be\r\nintroduced with great advantage, at least at some of the stages of\r\nthe manufacture. In the present chaotic state of industry, nails and\r\ncheap pen-knives can be made by hand, and plain cottons be woven\r\nin the hand-loom; but such an anomaly will not last. The machine\r\nwill supersede hand-work in the manufacture of plain goods. But at\r\nthe same time, handwork very probably will extend its domain in the\r\nartistic finishing of many things which are now made entirely in the\r\nfactory; and it will always remain an important factor in the growth\r\nof thousands of young and new trades.\r\n\r\nBut the question arises, Why should not the cottons, the woollen\r\ncloth, and the silks, now woven by hand in the villages, be woven by\r\nmachinery in the same villages, without ceasing to remain connected\r\nwith work in the fields? Why should not hundreds of domestic\r\nindustries, now carried on entirely by hand, resort to labour-saving\r\nmachines, as they already do in the knitting trade and many others?\r\nThere is no reason why the small motor should not be of a much more\r\ngeneral use than it is now, wherever there is no need to have a\r\nfactory; and there is no reason why the village should not have its\r\nsmall factory, wherever factory work is preferable, as we already see\r\nit occasionally in certain villages in France.\r\n\r\nMore than that. There is no reason why the factory, with its motive\r\nforce and machinery, should not belong to the community, as is\r\nalready the case for motive power in the above-mentioned workshops\r\nand small factories in the French portion of the Jura hills. It is\r\nevident that now, under the capitalist system, the factory is the\r\ncurse of the village, as it comes to overwork children and to make\r\npaupers out of its male inhabitants; and it is quite natural that it\r\nshould be opposed by all means by the workers, if they have succeeded\r\nin maintaining their olden trades’ organisations (as at Sheffield,\r\nor Solingen), or if they have not yet been reduced to sheer misery\r\n(as in the Jura). But under a more rational social organisation the\r\nfactory would find no such obstacles: it would be a boon to the\r\nvillage. And there is already unmistakable evidence to show that a\r\nmove in this direction _is being made_ in a few village communities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe moral and physical advantages which man would derive from\r\ndividing his work between the field and the workshop are\r\nself-evident. But the difficulty is, we are told, in the necessary\r\ncentralisation of the modern industries. In industry, as well as in\r\npolitics, centralisation has so many admirers! But in both spheres\r\nthe ideal of the centralisers badly needs revision. In fact, if we\r\nanalyse the modern industries, we soon discover that for some of\r\nthem the co-operation of hundreds, or even thousands, of workers\r\ngathered at the same spot is really necessary. The great iron works\r\nand mining enterprises decidedly belong to that category; oceanic\r\nsteamers cannot be built in village factories. But very many of our\r\nbig factories are nothing else but agglomerations under a common\r\nmanagement, of several distinct industries; while others are mere\r\nagglomerations of hundreds of copies of the very same machine; such\r\nare most of our gigantic spinning and weaving establishments.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture being a strictly private enterprise, its owners\r\nfind it advantageous to have all the branches of a given industry\r\nunder their own management; they thus cumulate the profits of the\r\nsuccessive transformations of the raw material. And when several\r\nthousand power-looms are combined in one factory, the owner finds his\r\nadvantage in being able to hold the command of the market. But from a\r\n_technical_ point of view the advantages of such an accumulation are\r\ntrifling and often doubtful. Even so centralised an industry as that\r\nof the cottons does not suffer at all from the division of production\r\nof one given sort of goods at its different stages between several\r\nseparate factories: we see it at Manchester and its neighbouring\r\ntowns. As to the petty trades, no inconvenience is experienced from\r\na still greater subdivision between the workshops in the watch trade\r\nand very many others.\r\n\r\nWe often hear that one horse-power costs so much in a small engine,\r\nand so much less in an engine ten times more powerful; that the\r\npound of cotton yarn costs much less when the factory doubles the\r\nnumber of its spindles. But, in the opinion of the best engineering\r\nauthorities, such as Prof. W. Unwin, the hydraulic, and especially\r\nthe electric, distribution of power from a central station sets\r\naside the first part of the argument.[184] As to its second part,\r\ncalculations of this sort are only good for those industries which\r\nprepare the half-manufactured produce for further transformations.\r\nAs to those countless descriptions of goods which derive their value\r\nchiefly from the intervention of skilled labour, they can be best\r\nfabricated in smaller factories which employ a few hundreds, or even\r\na few scores of operatives. This is why the “concentration” so much\r\nspoken of is often nothing but an amalgamation of capitalists for the\r\npurpose of _dominating the market_, not for cheapening the technical\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nEven under the present conditions the leviathan factories offer\r\ngreat inconveniences, as they cannot rapidly reform their machinery\r\naccording to the constantly varying demands of the consumers. How\r\nmany failures of great concerns, too well known in this country\r\nto need to be named, were due to this cause during the crisis of\r\n1886-1890. As for the new branches of industry which I have mentioned\r\nat the beginning of the previous chapter, they always must make a\r\nstart on a small scale; and they can prosper in small towns as well\r\nas in big cities, if the smaller agglomerations are provided with\r\ninstitutions stimulating artistic taste and the genius of invention.\r\nThe progress achieved of late in toy-making, as also the high\r\nperfection attained in the fabrication of mathematical and optical\r\ninstruments, of furniture, of small luxury articles, of pottery\r\nand so on, are instances in point. Art and science are no longer\r\nthe monopoly of the great cities, and further progress will be in\r\nscattering them over the country.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of industries in a given country\r\ndepends, of course, to a great extent upon a complexus of natural\r\nconditions; it is obvious that there are spots which are best suited\r\nfor the development of certain industries. The banks of the Clyde\r\nand the Tyne are certainly most appropriate for shipbuilding yards,\r\nand shipbuilding yards must be surrounded by a variety of workshops\r\nand factories. The industries will always find some advantages in\r\nbeing grouped, to some extent, according to the natural features of\r\nseparate regions. But we must recognise that now they are _not at\r\nall_ grouped according to those features. Historical causes--chiefly\r\nreligious wars and national rivalries--have had a good deal to do\r\nwith their growth and their present distribution; still more so the\r\nemployers were guided by considerations as to the facilities for sale\r\nand export--that is, by considerations which are already losing their\r\nimportance with the increased facilities for transport, and will lose\r\nit still more when the producers produce for themselves, and not for\r\ncustomers far away.\r\n\r\nWhy, in a rationally organised society, ought London to remain a\r\ngreat centre for the jam and preserving trade, and manufacture\r\numbrellas for nearly the whole of the United Kingdom? Why should the\r\ncountless Whitechapel petty trades remain where they are, instead\r\nof being spread all over the country? There is no reason whatever\r\nwhy the mantles which are worn by English ladies should be sewn at\r\nBerlin and in Whitechapel, instead of in Devonshire or Derbyshire.\r\nWhy should Paris refine sugar for almost the whole of France? Why\r\nshould one-half of the boots and shoes used in the United States\r\nbe manufactured in the 1,500 workshops of Massachusetts? There is\r\nabsolutely no reason why these and like anomalies should persist. The\r\nindustries must be scattered all over the world; and the scattering\r\nof industries amidst all civilised nations will be necessarily\r\nfollowed by a further scattering of factories over the territories of\r\neach nation.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this evolution, the natural produce of each region\r\nand its geographical conditions certainly will be _one_ of the\r\nfactors which will determine the character of the industries going\r\nto develop in this region. But when we see that Switzerland has\r\nbecome a great exporter of steam-engines, railway engines, and\r\nsteam-boats--although she has no iron ore and no coal for obtaining\r\nsteel, and even has no seaport to import them; when we see that\r\nBelgium has succeeded in being a great exporter of grapes, and that\r\nManchester has managed to become a seaport--we understand that in the\r\ngeographical distribution of industries, the two factors of local\r\nproduces and of an advantageous position by the sea are not yet the\r\ndominant factors. We begin to understand that, all taken, it is the\r\n_intellectual_ factor--the spirit of invention, the capacity of\r\nadaptation, political liberty, and so on--which counts for more than\r\nall others.\r\n\r\nThat all the industries find an advantage in being carried on in\r\nclose contact with a great variety of other industries the reader\r\nhas seen already from numerous examples. Every industry requires\r\n_technical surroundings_. But the same is also true of agriculture.\r\n\r\nAgriculture cannot develop without the aid of machinery, and the\r\nuse of a perfect machinery cannot be generalised without industrial\r\nsurroundings: without mechanical workshops, easily accessible to\r\nthe cultivator of the soil, the use of agricultural machinery is\r\nnot possible. The village smith would not do. If the work of a\r\nthrashing-machine has to be stopped for a week or more, because one\r\nof the cogs in a wheel has been broken, and if to obtain a new wheel\r\none must send a special messenger to the next province--then the\r\nuse of a thrashing-machine is not possible. But this is precisely\r\nwhat I saw in my childhood in Central Russia; and quite lately I\r\nhave found the very same fact mentioned in an English autobiography\r\nin the first half of the nineteenth century. Besides, in all the\r\nnorthern part of the temperate zone, the cultivators of the soil\r\nmust have some sort of industrial employment during the long winter\r\nmonths. This is what has brought about the great development of rural\r\nindustries, of which we have just seen such interesting examples. But\r\nthis need is also felt in the soft climate of the Channel Islands,\r\nnotwithstanding the extension taken by horticulture under glass. “We\r\nneed such industries. Could you suggest us any?” wrote to me one of\r\nmy correspondents in Guernsey.\r\n\r\nBut this is not yet all. Agriculture is so much in need of aid from\r\nthose who inhabit the cities, that every summer thousands of men\r\nleave their slums in the towns and go to the country for the season\r\nof crops. The London destitutes go in thousands to Kent and Sussex\r\nas hay-makers and hop-pickers, it being estimated that Kent alone\r\nrequires 80,000 additional men and women for hop-picking; whole\r\nvillages in France and their cottage industries are abandoned in\r\nthe summer, and the peasants wander to the more fertile parts of\r\nthe country; hundreds of thousands of human beings are transported\r\nevery summer to the prairies of Manitoba and Dacota. Every summer\r\nmany thousands of Poles spread at harvest time over the plains of\r\nMecklenburg, Westphalia, and even France; and in Russia there is\r\nevery year an exodus of several millions of men who journey from the\r\nnorth to the southern prairies for harvesting the crops; while many\r\nSt. Petersburg manufacturers reduce their production in the summer,\r\nbecause the operatives return to their native villages for the\r\nculture of their allotments.\r\n\r\nAgriculture cannot be carried on without additional hands in the\r\nsummer; but it still more needs temporary aids for _improving_ the\r\nsoil, for tenfolding its productive powers. Steam-digging, drainage,\r\nand manuring would render the heavy clays in the north-west of London\r\na much richer soil than that of the American prairies. To become\r\nfertile, those clays want only plain, unskilled human labour, such\r\nas is necessary for digging the soil, laying in drainage tubes,\r\npulverising phosphorites, and the like; and that labour would be\r\ngladly done by the factory workers if it were properly organised in a\r\nfree community for the benefit of the whole society. The soil claims\r\nthat sort of aid, and it would have it under a proper organisation,\r\neven if it were necessary to stop many mills in the summer for that\r\npurpose. No doubt the present factory owners would consider it\r\nruinous if they had to stop their mills for several months every\r\nyear, because the capital engaged in a factory is expected to pump\r\nmoney every day and every hour, if possible. But that is the\r\ncapitalist’s view of the matter, not the community’s view.\r\n\r\nAs to the workers, who ought to be the real managers of industries,\r\nthey will find it healthy _not_ to perform the same monotonous work\r\nall the year round, and they will abandon it for the summer, if\r\nindeed they do not find the means of keeping the factory running by\r\nrelieving each other in groups.\r\n\r\nThe scattering of industries over the country--so as to bring the\r\nfactory amidst the fields, to make agriculture derive all those\r\nprofits which it always finds in being combined with industry\r\n(see the Eastern States of America) and to produce a combination\r\nof industrial with agricultural work--is surely the next step to\r\nbe made, as soon as a reorganisation of our present conditions is\r\npossible. It is being made already, here and there, as we saw on\r\nthe preceding pages. This step is imposed by the very necessity\r\nof _producing for the producers themselves_; it is imposed by the\r\nnecessity for each healthy man and woman to spend a part of their\r\nlives in manual work in the free air; and it will be rendered the\r\nmore necessary when the great social movements, which have now\r\nbecome unavoidable, come to disturb the present international\r\ntrade, and compel each nation to revert to her own resources for\r\nher own maintenance. Humanity as a whole, as well as each separate\r\nindividual, will be gainers by the change, and the change will take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nHowever, such a change also implies a thorough modification of our\r\npresent system of education. It implies a society composed of men and\r\nwomen, each of whom is able to work with his or her hands, as well as\r\nwith his or her brain, and to do so in more directions than one. This\r\n“integration of capacities” and “integral education” I am now going\r\nto analyse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[169] The remarks of Prof. Issaieff--a thorough investigator of petty\r\ntrades in Russia, Germany and France--(see _Works of the Commission\r\nfor the Study of Petty Trades in Russia_ (Russian), St. Petersburg,\r\n1879-1887, vol. i.) were for me a valuable guide when I prepared\r\nthe first edition of this book. Since that time the two industrial\r\ncensuses of 1895 and 1907 have yielded such a valuable material,\r\nthat there are quite a number of German works which came to the same\r\nconclusions. I shall mention them further on.\r\n\r\n[170] See K. Buecher’s Preface to the _Untersuchungen über die Lage\r\ndes Handwerks in Deutschland_, vol. iv.\r\n\r\n[171] The foundation for this creed is contained in one of the\r\nconcluding chapters of Marx’s _Kapital_ (the last but one), in\r\nwhich the author spoke of the concentration of capital and saw in\r\nit the “fatality of a natural law.” In the “forties,” this idea of\r\n“concentration of capital,” originated from what was going on in the\r\ntextile industries, was continually recurring in the writings of\r\nall the French socialists, especially Considérant, and their German\r\nfollowers, and it was used by them as an argument in favour of the\r\nnecessity of a social revolution. But Marx was too much of a thinker\r\nthat he should not have taken notice of the subsequent developments\r\nof industrial life, which were not foreseen in 1848; if he had lived\r\nnow, he surely would _not_ have shut his eyes to the formidable\r\ngrowth of the numbers of small capitalists and to the middle-class\r\nfortunes which are made in a thousand ways under the shadow of the\r\nmodern “millionaires.” Very likely he would have noticed also the\r\nextreme slowness with which the wrecking of small industries goes\r\non--a slowness which could not be predicted fifty or forty years ago,\r\nbecause no one could foresee at that time the facilities which have\r\nbeen offered since for transport, the growing variety of demand, nor\r\nthe cheap means which are now in use for the supply of motive power\r\nin small quantities. Being a thinker, he would have studied these\r\nfacts, and very probably he would have mitigated the absoluteness\r\nof his earlier formulæ, as in fact he did once with regard to the\r\nvillage community in Russia. It would be most desirable that his\r\nfollowers should rely less upon abstract formulæ--easy as they may\r\nbe as watchwords in political struggles--and try to imitate their\r\nteacher in his analysis of _concrete_ economical phenomena.\r\n\r\n[172] _The Economic Interpretation of History._\r\n\r\n[173] _Les Progrès de la Science économique depuis Adam Smith_,\r\nParis, 1890, t. i., pp. 460, 461.\r\n\r\n[174] See the discussions in the Reichstag in January, 1909, on\r\nthe Polish Syndicates, and the application that is made to them of\r\nthe paragraph of the law of the associations relative to language\r\n(_Sprachenparagraph_).\r\n\r\n[175] See Appendix X.\r\n\r\n[176] See Appendix Y.\r\n\r\n[177] Here is the distribution of workpeople in all the industries,\r\naccording to the _Annuaire Statistique_ for the year 1909: Artisans\r\nworking single-handed or with the aid of their families, 165,000\r\nestablishments; very small industry, from one to four workpeople,\r\n54,000 establishments, 95,000 workpeople; small industry, from five\r\nto forty-nine workpeople per factory, 14,800 establishments, 177,000\r\nemployees; middle-sized and great industry, from 50 to 499 workpeople\r\nper factory, 1,500 establishments, 250,000 employees; very great\r\nindustry, above 500 workpeople per factory, 200 establishments,\r\n160,000 employees. Total, 236,000 employers great and small; or\r\n71,000 employers out of 7,000,000 inhabitants if we do not count the\r\nindependent artisans.\r\n\r\n[178] When shall we have for the United Kingdom a census as\r\ncomplete as we have it for France, Germany, and Belgium? that is,\r\na census in which the employed and the employers will be counted\r\nseparately--instead of throwing into one heap the owner of the\r\nfactory, the managers, the engineers, and the workers--and their\r\ndistribution in factories of different sizes will be given.\r\n\r\n[179] _Textile Industries_: Artisans working single or with the\r\naid of their families, 1,437; from one to four workmen, 430\r\nestablishments, 949 workpeople; from five to forty-nine workpeople,\r\n774 establishments, 14,051 workers; above fifty, 379 establishments,\r\n66,103 workers.\r\n\r\n[180] Since 1907 the Russian Government has inaugurated this policy,\r\nand has begun to destroy by violence the village community in the\r\ninterest of the landlord and the protected industries.\r\n\r\n[181] It appears from the house-to-house inquiry, which embodies\r\n855,000 workers, that the yearly value of the produce which they\r\nuse to manufacture reaches £21,087,000 (the rouble at 24d.),\r\nthat is, an average of £25 per worker. An average of £20 for the\r\n7,500,000 persons engaged in domestic industries would already\r\ngive £150,000,000 for their aggregate production; but the most\r\nauthoritative investigators consider that figure as below the reality.\r\n\r\n[182] Some of the produces of the Russian rural industries have\r\nlately been introduced in this country, and find a good sale.\r\n\r\n[183] Prugavin, in the _Vyestnik Promyshlennosti_, June, 1884.\r\nSee also the excellent work of V. V. (Vorontsoff) _Destinies of\r\nCapitalism in Russia_, 1882 (Russia).\r\n\r\n[184] I may add from my own experience that such is also the opinion\r\nof several Manchester employers: “I am saving a great deal by using\r\nmunicipal electric power in my factory, instead of the steam-engine.”\r\nI was told by one of the most respected members of the Manchester\r\ncommunity: “I pay for motive power according to the number of persons\r\nI employ--two hundred at certain times, and fifty in other parts of\r\nthe year. I need not buy coal and stock it in advance for all the\r\nyear; I have saved the room that was occupied by the steam-engine;\r\nand the room above it is not heated and shaken by the engine as it\r\nused to be.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nBRAIN WORK AND MANUAL WORK.\r\n\r\n  Divorce between science and handicraft--Technical\r\n  education--Complete education--The Moscow system: applied at\r\n  Chicago, Boston, Aberdeen--Concrete teaching--Present waste of\r\n  time--Science and technics--Advantages which science can derive\r\n  from a combination of brain work with manual work.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn olden times men of science, and especially those who have done\r\nmost to forward the growth of natural philosophy, did not despise\r\nmanual work and handicraft. Galileo made his telescopes with his own\r\nhands. Newton learned in his boyhood the art of managing tools; he\r\nexercised his young mind in contriving most ingenious machines, and\r\nwhen he began his researches in optics he was able himself to grind\r\nthe lenses for his instruments, and himself to make the well-known\r\ntelescope, which, for its time, was a fine piece of workmanship.\r\nLeibnitz was fond of inventing machines: windmills and carriages to\r\nbe moved without horses preoccupied his mind as much as mathematical\r\nand philosophical speculations. Linnæus became a botanist while\r\nhelping his father--a practical gardener--in his daily work. In\r\nshort, with our great geniuses handicraft was no obstacle to abstract\r\nresearches--it rather favoured them. On the other hand, if the\r\nworkers of old found but few opportunities for mastering science,\r\nmany of them had, at least, their intelligences stimulated by the\r\nvery variety of work which was performed in the then unspecialised\r\nworkshops; and some of them had the benefit of familiar intercourse\r\nwith men of science. Watt and Rennie were friends with Professor\r\nRobinson; Brindley, the road-maker, despite his fourteenpence-a-day\r\nwages, enjoyed intercourse with educated men, and thus developed his\r\nremarkable engineering faculties; the son of a well-to-do family\r\ncould “idle” at a wheel-wright’s shop, so as to become later on a\r\nSmeaton or a Stephenson.\r\n\r\nWe have changed all that. Under the pretext of division of labour, we\r\nhave sharply separated the brain worker from the manual worker. The\r\nmasses of the workmen do not receive more scientific education than\r\ntheir grandfathers did; but they have been deprived of the education\r\nof even the small workshop, while their boys and girls are driven\r\ninto a mine or a factory from the age of thirteen, and there they\r\nsoon forget the little they may have learned at school. As to the men\r\nof science, they despise manual labour. How few of them would be able\r\nto make a telescope, or even a plainer instrument! Most of them are\r\nnot capable of even designing a scientific instrument, and when they\r\nhave given a vague suggestion to the instrument-maker, they leave it\r\nwith him to invent the apparatus they need. Nay, they have raised\r\nthe contempt of manual labour to the height of a theory. “The man\r\nof science,” they say, “must discover the laws of nature, the civil\r\nengineer must apply them, and the worker must execute in steel or\r\nwood, in iron or stone, the patterns devised by the engineer. He must\r\nwork with machines invented for him, not by him. No matter if he does\r\nnot understand them and cannot improve them: the scientific man and\r\nthe scientific engineer will take care of the progress of science and\r\nindustry.”\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that nevertheless there is a class of men who\r\nbelong to none of the above three divisions. When young they have\r\nbeen manual workers, and some of them continue to be; but, owing\r\nto some happy circumstances, they have succeeded in acquiring some\r\nscientific knowledge, and thus they have combined science with\r\nhandicraft. Surely there are such men; happily enough there is a\r\nnucleus of men who have escaped the so-much-advocated specialisation\r\nof labour, and it is precisely to them that industry owes its\r\nchief recent inventions. But in old Europe, at least, they are the\r\nexceptions; they are the irregulars--the Cossacks who have broken\r\nthe ranks and pierced the screens so carefully erected between the\r\nclasses. And they are so few, in comparison with the ever-growing\r\nrequirements of industry--and of science as well, as I am about to\r\nprove--that all over the world we hear complaints about the scarcity\r\nof precisely such men.\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning, in fact, of the outcry for technical education\r\nwhich has been raised at one and the same time in England, in France,\r\nin Germany, in the States, and in Russia, if it does not express a\r\ngeneral dissatisfaction with the present division into scientists,\r\nscientific engineers, and workers? Listen to those who know industry,\r\nand you will see that the substance of their complaints is this: “The\r\nworker whose task has been specialised by the permanent division of\r\nlabour has lost the intellectual interest in his labour, and it is\r\nespecially so in the great industries: he has lost his inventive\r\npowers. Formerly, he invented very much. Manual workers--not men\r\nof science nor trained engineers--have invented, or brought to\r\nperfection, the prime motors and all that mass of machinery which\r\nhas revolutionised industry for the last hundred years. But since\r\nthe great factory has been enthroned, the worker, depressed by the\r\nmonotony of his work, invents no more. What can a weaver invent who\r\nmerely supervises four looms, without knowing anything either about\r\ntheir complicated movements or how the machines grew to be what they\r\nare? What can a man invent who is condemned for life to bind together\r\nthe ends of two threads with the greatest celerity, and knows nothing\r\nbeyond making a knot?\r\n\r\n“At the outset of modern industry, three generations of workers\r\n_have_ invented; now they cease to do so. As to the inventions of\r\nthe engineers, specially trained for devising machines, they are\r\neither devoid of genius or not practical enough. Those ‘nearly to\r\nnothings,’ of which Sir Frederick Bramwell spoke once at Bath, are\r\nmissing in their inventions--those nothings which can be learned\r\nin the workshop only, and which permitted a Murdoch and the Soho\r\nworkers to make a practical engine of Watt’s schemes. None but he\r\nwho knows the machine--not in its drawings and models only, but in\r\nits breathing and throbbings--who unconsciously thinks of it while\r\nstanding by it, can really improve it. Smeaton and Newcomen surely\r\nwere excellent engineers; but in their engines a boy had to open the\r\nsteam valve at each stroke of the piston; and it was one of those\r\nboys who once managed to connect the valve with the remainder of the\r\nmachine, so as to make it open automatically, while he ran away to\r\nplay with other boys. But in the modern machinery there is no room\r\nleft for naïve improvements of that kind. Scientific education on\r\na wide scale has become necessary for further inventions, and that\r\neducation is refused to the workers. So that there is no issue out\r\nof the difficulty, unless scientific education and handicraft are\r\ncombined together--unless integration of knowledge takes the place of\r\nthe present divisions.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the real substance of the present movement in favour of\r\ntechnical education. But, instead of bringing to public consciousness\r\nthe, perhaps, unconscious motives of the present discontent, instead\r\nof widening the views of the discontented and discussing the problem\r\nto its full extent, the mouthpieces of the movement do not mostly\r\nrise above the shopkeeper’s view of the question. Some of them\r\nindulge in jingo talk about crushing all foreign industries out of\r\ncompetition, while the others see in technical education nothing but\r\na means of somewhat improving the flesh-machine of the factory and of\r\ntransferring a few workers into the upper class of trained engineers.\r\n\r\nSuch an ideal may satisfy them, but it cannot satisfy those who keep\r\nin view the combined interests of science and industry, and consider\r\nboth as a means for raising humanity to a higher level. We maintain\r\nthat in the interests of both science and industry, as well as of\r\nsociety as a whole, every human being, without distinction of birth,\r\nought to receive such an education as would enable him, or her, to\r\ncombine a thorough knowledge of science with a thorough knowledge of\r\nhandicraft. We fully recognise the necessity of specialisation of\r\nknowledge, but we maintain that specialisation must follow general\r\neducation, and that general education must be given in science and\r\nhandicraft alike. To the division of society into brain workers and\r\nmanual workers we oppose the combination of both kinds of activities;\r\nand instead of “technical education,” which means the maintenance of\r\nthe present division between brain work and manual work, we advocate\r\nthe _éducation intégrale_, or complete education, which means the\r\ndisappearance of that pernicious distinction.\r\n\r\nPlainly stated, the aims of the school under this system ought to\r\nbe the following: To give such an education that, on leaving school\r\nat the age of eighteen or twenty, each boy and each girl should be\r\nendowed with a thorough knowledge of science--such a knowledge as\r\nmight enable them to be useful workers in science--and, at the same\r\ntime, to give them a general knowledge of what constitutes the bases\r\nof technical training, and such a skill in some special trade as\r\nwould enable each of them to take his or her place in the grand world\r\nof the manual production of wealth.[185] I know that many will find\r\nthat aim too large, or even impossible to attain, but I hope that if\r\nthey have the patience to read the following pages, they will see\r\nthat we require nothing beyond what can be easily attained. In fact,\r\n_it has been attained_; and what has been done on a small scale could\r\nbe done on a wider scale, were it not for the economical and social\r\ncauses which prevent any serious reform from being accomplished in\r\nour miserably organised society.\r\n\r\nThe experiment has been made at the Moscow Technical School for\r\ntwenty consecutive years with many hundreds of boys; and, according\r\nto the testimonies of the most competent judges at the exhibitions of\r\nBrussels, Philadelphia, Vienna, and Paris, the experiment has been a\r\nsuccess. The Moscow school admitted boys not older than fifteen,[186]\r\nand it required from boys of that age nothing but a substantial\r\nknowledge of geometry and algebra, together with the usual knowledge\r\nof their mother tongue; younger pupils were received in the\r\npreparatory classes. The school was divided into two sections--the\r\nmechanical and the chemical; but as I personally know better the\r\nformer, and as it is also the more important with reference to the\r\nquestion before us, so I shall limit my remarks to the education\r\ngiven in the mechanical section.\r\n\r\nAfter a five or six years’ stay at the school, the students left\r\nit with a thorough knowledge of higher mathematics, physics,\r\nmechanics, and connected sciences--so thorough, indeed, that it was\r\nnot second to that acquired in the best mathematical faculties of\r\nthe most eminent European universities. When myself a student of\r\nthe mathematical faculty of the St. Petersburg University, I had\r\nthe opportunity of comparing the knowledge of the students at the\r\nMoscow Technical School with our own. I saw the courses of higher\r\ngeometry some of them had compiled for the use of their comrades; I\r\nadmired the facility with which they applied the integral calculus\r\nto dynamical problems, and I came to the conclusion that while we,\r\nUniversity students, had more knowledge of a general character\r\n(for instance, in mathematical astronomy), they, the students of\r\nthe Technical School, were much more advanced in higher geometry,\r\nand especially in the applications of higher mathematics to the\r\nintricate problems of dynamics, the theories of heat and elasticity.\r\nBut while we, the students of the University, hardly knew the use\r\nof our hands, the students of the Technical School fabricated _with\r\ntheir own hands_, and without the help of professional workmen,\r\nfine steam-engines, from the heavy boiler to the last finely turned\r\nscrew, agricultural machinery, and scientific apparatus--all for the\r\ntrade--and they received the highest awards for the work of their\r\nhands at the international exhibitions. They were scientifically\r\neducated skilled workers--workers with university education--highly\r\nappreciated even by the Russian manufacturers who so much distrust\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nNow, the methods by which these wonderful results were achieved were\r\nthese: In science, learning from memory was not in honour, while\r\nindependent research was favoured by all means. Science was taught\r\nhand in hand with its applications, and what was learned in the\r\nschoolroom was applied in the workshop. Great attention was paid\r\nto the highest abstractions of geometry as a means for developing\r\nimagination and research.\r\n\r\nAs to the teaching of handicraft, the methods were quite different\r\nfrom those which proved a failure at the Cornell University, and\r\ndiffered, in fact, from those used in most technical schools. The\r\nstudent was not sent to a workshop to learn some special handicraft\r\nand to earn his existence as soon as possible; but the teaching\r\nof technical skill was prosecuted in the same systematical way as\r\nlaboratory work is taught in the universities, according to a scheme\r\nelaborated by the founder of the school, M. Dellavos, and now applied\r\nat Chicago and Boston. It is evident that drawing was considered as\r\nthe first step in technical education. Then the student was brought,\r\nfirst, to the carpenter’s workshop, or rather laboratory, and there\r\nhe was thoroughly taught to execute all kinds of carpentry and\r\njoinery. They did not teach the pupil to make some insignificant work\r\nof house decoration, as they do in the system of the _slöjd_--the\r\nSwedish method, which is taught especially at the Nääs school--but\r\nthey taught him, to begin with, to make very accurately a wooden\r\ncube, a prism, a cylinder (with the planing jack), and then--all\r\nfundamental types of joining. In a word, he had to study, so to say,\r\nthe philosophy of joinery by means of manual work. No efforts were\r\nspared in order to bring the pupil to a certain perfection in that\r\nbranch--the real basis of all trades.\r\n\r\nLater on, the pupil was transferred to the turner’s workshop, where\r\nhe was taught to make in wood the patterns of those things which he\r\nwould have to make in metal in the following workshops. The foundry\r\nfollowed, and there he was taught to cast those parts of machines\r\nwhich he had prepared in wood; and it was only after he had gone\r\nthrough the first three stages that he was admitted to the smith’s\r\nand engineering workshops. Such was the system which English readers\r\nwill find described in full in a work by Mr. Ch. H. Ham.[187] As for\r\nthe perfection of the mechanical work of the students, I cannot do\r\nbetter than refer to the reports of the juries at the above-named\r\nexhibitions.\r\n\r\nIn America the same system has been introduced, in its technical\r\npart, first, in the Chicago Manual Training School, and later on in\r\nthe Boston Technical School--the best, I am told, of the sort--and\r\nfinally at Tuskegee, in the excellent school for coloured young men.\r\nIn this country, or rather in Scotland, I found the system applied\r\nwith full success, for some years, under the direction of Dr. Ogilvie\r\nat Gordon’s College in Aberdeen. It is the Moscow or Chicago system\r\non a limited scale. While receiving substantial scientific education,\r\nthe pupils are also trained in the workshops--but not for one special\r\ntrade, as it unhappily too often is the case. They pass through the\r\ncarpenter’s workshop, the casting in metals, and the engineering\r\nworkshop; and in each of these they learn the foundations of each of\r\nthe three trades sufficiently well for supplying the school itself\r\nwith a number of useful things. Besides, as far as I could ascertain\r\nfrom what I saw in the geographical and physical classes, as also\r\nin the chemical laboratory, the system of “through the hand to the\r\nbrain,” and _vice versâ_, is in full swing, and it is attended with\r\nthe best success. The boys _work_ with the physical instruments, and\r\nthey study geography in the field, instruments in hands, as well as\r\nin the class-room. Some of their surveys filled my heart, as an old\r\ngeographer, with joy.[188]\r\n\r\nThe Moscow Technical School surely was not an ideal school.[189]\r\nIt totally neglected the humanitarian education of the young men.\r\nBut we must recognise that the Moscow experiment--not to speak of\r\nhundreds of other partial experiments--has perfectly well proved\r\nthe possibility of combining a scientific education of a very high\r\nstandard with the education which is necessary for becoming an\r\nexcellent skilled workman. It has proved, moreover, that the best\r\nmeans for producing really good skilled labourers is to seize the\r\nbull by the horns, and to grasp the educational problem in its great\r\nfeatures, instead of trying to give some special skill in some\r\nhandicraft, together with a few scraps of knowledge in a certain\r\nbranch of some science. And it has shown also what can be obtained,\r\nwithout over-pressure, if a rational economy of the scholar’s time\r\nis always kept in view, and theory goes hand in hand with practice.\r\nViewed in this light, the Moscow results do not seem extraordinary at\r\nall, and still better results may be expected if the same principles\r\nare applied from the earliest years of education.\r\n\r\nWaste of time is the leading feature of our present education. Not\r\nonly are we taught a mass of rubbish, but what is not rubbish is\r\ntaught so as to make us waste over it as much time as possible.\r\nOur present methods of teaching originate from a time when the\r\naccomplishments required from an educated person were extremely\r\nlimited; and they have been maintained, notwithstanding the immense\r\nincrease of knowledge which must be conveyed to the scholar’s mind\r\nsince science has so much widened its former limits. Hence the\r\nover-pressure in schools, and hence, also, the urgent necessity of\r\ntotally revising both the subjects and the methods of teaching,\r\naccording to the new wants and to the examples already given here and\r\nthere, by separate schools and separate teachers.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the years of childhood ought not to be spent\r\nso uselessly as they are now. German teachers have shown how the\r\nvery plays of children can be made instrumental in conveying to\r\nthe childish mind some concrete knowledge in both geometry and\r\nmathematics. The children who have made the squares of the theorem\r\nof Pythagoras out of pieces of coloured cardboard, will not look at\r\nthe theorem, when it comes in geometry, as on a mere instrument of\r\ntorture devised by the teachers; and the less so if they apply it\r\nas the carpenters do. Complicated problems of arithmetic, which so\r\nmuch harassed us in our boyhood, are easily solved by children seven\r\nand eight years old if they are put in the shape of interesting\r\npuzzles. And if the _Kindergarten_--German teachers often make of it\r\na kind of barrack in which each movement of the child is regulated\r\nbeforehand--has often become a small prison for the little ones, the\r\nidea which presided at its foundation is nevertheless true. In fact,\r\nit is almost impossible to imagine, without having tried it, how\r\nmany sound notions of nature, habits of classification, and taste\r\nfor natural sciences can be conveyed to the children’s minds; and,\r\nif a series of concentric courses adapted to the various phases of\r\ndevelopment of the human being were generally accepted in education,\r\nthe first series in all sciences, save sociology, could be taught\r\nbefore the age of ten or twelve, so as to give a general idea of\r\nthe universe, the earth and its inhabitants, the chief physical,\r\nchemical, zoological, and botanical phenomena, leaving the discovery\r\nof the _laws_ of those phenomena to the next series of deeper and\r\nmore specialised studies.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, we all know how children like to make toys\r\nthemselves, how they gladly imitate the work of full-grown people if\r\nthey see them at work in the workshop or the building-yard. But the\r\nparents either stupidly paralyse that passion, or do not know how to\r\nutilise it. Most of them despise manual work and prefer sending their\r\nchildren to the study of Roman history, or of Franklin’s teachings\r\nabout saving money, to seeing them at a work which is good for the\r\n“lower classes only.” They thus do their best to render subsequent\r\nlearning the more difficult.\r\n\r\nAnd then come the school years, and time is wasted again to an\r\nincredible extent. Take, for instance, mathematics, which every one\r\nought to know, because it is the basis of all subsequent education,\r\nand which so few really learn in our schools. In geometry, time\r\nis foolishly wasted by using a method which merely consists in\r\ncommitting geometry to memory. In most cases, the boy reads again\r\nand again the proof of a theorem till his memory has retained the\r\nsuccession of reasonings. Therefore, nine boys out of ten, if\r\nasked to prove an elementary theorem two years after having left\r\nthe school, will be unable to do it, unless mathematics is their\r\nspeciality. They will forget which auxiliary lines to draw, and they\r\nnever have been taught to _discover_ the proofs by themselves. No\r\nwonder that later on they find such difficulties in applying geometry\r\nto physics, that their progress is despairingly sluggish, and that so\r\nfew master higher mathematics.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, the other method which permits the pupil to\r\nprogress, as a whole, at a much speedier rate, and under which he who\r\nonce has learned geometry will know it all his life long. Under this\r\nsystem, each theorem is put as a problem; its solution is never given\r\nbeforehand, and the pupil is induced to find it by himself. Thus, if\r\nsome preliminary exercises with the rule and the compass have been\r\nmade, there is not one boy or girl, out of twenty or more, who will\r\nnot be able to find the means of drawing an angle which is equal to\r\na given angle, and to prove their equality, after a few suggestions\r\nfrom the teacher; and if the subsequent problems are given in a\r\nsystematic succession (there are excellent text-books for the\r\npurpose), and the teacher does not press his pupils to go faster than\r\nthey can go at the beginning, they advance from one problem to the\r\nnext with an astonishing facility, the only difficulty being to bring\r\nthe pupil to solve the first problem, and thus to acquire confidence\r\nin his own reasoning.\r\n\r\nMoreover, each abstract geometrical truth must be impressed on the\r\nmind in its concrete form as well. As soon as the pupils have solved\r\na few problems on paper, they must solve them in the playing-ground\r\nwith a few sticks and a string, and they must apply their knowledge\r\nin the workshop. Only then will the geometrical lines acquire a\r\nconcrete meaning in the children’s minds; only then will they see\r\nthat the teacher is playing no tricks when he asks them to solve\r\nproblems with the rule and the compass without resorting to the\r\nprotractor; only then will they _know_ geometry.\r\n\r\n“Through the eyes _and_ the hand to the brain”--this is the true\r\nprinciple of economy of time in teaching. I remember, as if it were\r\nyesterday, how geometry suddenly acquired for me a new meaning, and\r\nhow this new meaning facilitated all ulterior studies. It was as\r\nwe were mastering at school a Montgolfier balloon, and I remarked\r\nthat the angles at the summits of each of the twenty strips of paper\r\nout of which we were going to make the balloon must cover less than\r\nthe fifth part of a right angle each. I remember, next, how the\r\nsinuses and the tangents ceased to be mere cabalistic signs when\r\nthey permitted us to calculate the length of a stick in a working\r\nprofile of a fortification; and how geometry in space became plain\r\nwhen we began to make on a small scale a bastion with embrasures\r\nand barbettes--an occupation which obviously was soon prohibited on\r\naccount of the state into which we brought our clothes. “You look\r\nlike navvies,” was the reproach addressed to us by our intelligent\r\neducators, while we were proud precisely of being navvies, and of\r\ndiscovering the use of geometry.\r\n\r\nBy compelling our children to study real things from mere graphical\r\nrepresentations, instead of _making_ those things themselves, we\r\ncompel them to waste the most precious time; we uselessly worry\r\ntheir minds; we accustom them to the worst methods of learning; we\r\nkill independent thought in the bud; and very seldom we succeed in\r\nconveying a real knowledge of what we are teaching. Superficiality,\r\nparrot-like repetition, slavishness and inertia of mind are the\r\nresults of our method of education. We do not teach our children how\r\nto learn.\r\n\r\nThe very beginnings of science are taught on the same pernicious\r\nsystem. In most schools even arithmetic is taught in the abstract\r\nway, and mere rules are stuffed into the poor little heads. The idea\r\nof a unit, which is arbitrary and can be changed at will in our\r\nmeasurement (the match, the box of matches, the dozen of boxes, or\r\nthe gross; the metre, the centimetre, the kilometre, and so on),\r\nis not impressed on the mind, and therefore when the children come\r\nto the decimal fractions they are at a loss to understand them. In\r\nthis country, the United States and Russia, instead of accepting the\r\ndecimal system, which is the system of our numeration, they still\r\ntorture the children by making them learn a system of weights and\r\nmeasures which ought to have been abandoned long since. The pupils\r\nlose at that full two years, and when they come later on to problems\r\nin mechanics and physics, schoolboys and schoolgirls spend most\r\nof their time in endless calculations which only fatigue them and\r\ninspire in them a dislike of exact science. But even there, where the\r\ndecimal measures have been introduced, much time is lost in school\r\nsimply because the teachers are not accustomed to the idea that every\r\nmeasure is only approximate, and that it is absurd to calculate with\r\nthe exactitude of one gramme, or of one metre, when the measuring\r\nitself does not give the elements of such an exactitude. Whereas in\r\nFrance, where the decimal system of measures and money is a matter\r\nof daily life, even those workers who have received the plainest\r\nelementary education are quite familiar with decimals. To represent\r\ntwenty-five centimes, or twenty-five centimetres, they write “zero\r\ntwenty-five,” while most of my readers surely remember how this same\r\nzero at the head of a row of figures puzzled them in their boyhood.\r\nWe do all that is possible to render algebra unintelligible, and our\r\nchildren spend one year before they have learned what is not algebra\r\nat all, but a mere system of abbreviations, which can be learned by\r\nthe way, if it is taught together with arithmetic.[190]\r\n\r\nThe waste of time in physics is simply revolting. While young people\r\nvery easily understand the principles of chemistry and its formulæ,\r\nas soon as they themselves make the first experiments with a few\r\nglasses and tubes, they mostly find the greatest difficulties in\r\ngrasping the mechanical introduction into physics, partly because\r\nthey do not know geometry, and especially because they are merely\r\nshown costly machines instead of being induced to make themselves\r\nplain apparatus for illustrating the phenomena they study.\r\n\r\nInstead of learning the laws of force with plain instruments which a\r\nboy of fifteen can easily make, they learn them from mere drawings,\r\nin a purely abstract fashion. Instead of making themselves an\r\nAtwood’s machine with a broomstick and the wheel of an old clock,\r\nor verifying the laws of falling bodies with a key gliding on an\r\ninclined string, they are shown a complicated apparatus, and in\r\nmost cases the teacher himself does not know how to explain to them\r\nthe principle of the apparatus, and indulges in irrelevant details.\r\nAnd so it goes on from the beginning to the end, with but a few\r\nhonourable exceptions.[191]\r\n\r\nIf waste of time is characteristic of our methods of teaching\r\nscience, it is characteristic as well of the methods used for\r\nteaching handicraft. We know how years are wasted when a boy serves\r\nhis apprenticeship in a workshop; but the same reproach can be\r\naddressed, to a great extent, to those technical schools which\r\nendeavour at once to teach some special handicraft, instead of\r\nresorting to the broader and surer methods of systematical teaching.\r\nJust as there are in science some notions and methods which are\r\npreparatory to the study of all sciences, so there are also some\r\nfundamental notions and methods preparatory to the special study of\r\nany handicraft.\r\n\r\nReuleaux has shown in that delightful book, the _Theoretische\r\nKinematik_, that there is, so to say, a philosophy of all possible\r\nmachinery. Each machine, however complicated, can be reduced to\r\na few elements--plates, cylinders, discs, cones, and so on--as\r\nwell as to a few tools--chisels, saws, rollers, hammers, etc.;\r\nand, however complicated its movements, they can be decomposed\r\ninto a few modifications of motion, such as the transformation of\r\ncircular motion into a rectilinear, and the like, with a number of\r\nintermediate links. So also each handicraft can be decomposed into a\r\nnumber of elements. In each trade one must know how to make a plate\r\nwith parallel surfaces, a cylinder, a disc, a square, and a round\r\nhole; how to manage a limited number of tools, all tools being mere\r\nmodifications of less than a dozen types; and how to transform one\r\nkind of motion into another. This is the foundation of all mechanical\r\nhandicrafts; so that the knowledge of how to make in wood those\r\nprimary elements, how to manage the chief tools in wood-work, and\r\nhow to transform various kinds of motion ought to be considered as\r\nthe very basis for the subsequent teaching of all possible kinds of\r\nmechanical handicraft. The pupil who has acquired that skill already\r\nknows one good half of all possible trades.\r\n\r\nBesides, none can be a good worker in science unless he is in\r\npossession of good methods of scientific research; unless he has\r\nlearned to observe, to describe with exactitude, to discover mutual\r\nrelations between facts seemingly disconnected, to make inductive\r\nhypotheses and to verify them, to reason upon cause and effect,\r\nand so on. And none can be a good manual worker unless he has been\r\naccustomed to the good methods of handicraft altogether. He must grow\r\naccustomed to conceive the subject of his thoughts in a concrete\r\nform, to draw it, or to model, to hate badly kept tools and bad\r\nmethods of work, to give to everything a fine touch of finish, to\r\nderive artistic enjoyment from the contemplation of gracious forms\r\nand combinations of colours, and dissatisfaction from what is ugly.\r\nBe it handicraft, science, or art, the chief aim of the school is not\r\nto make a specialist from a beginner, but to teach him the elements\r\nof knowledge and the good methods of work, and, above all, to give\r\nhim that general inspiration which will induce him, later on, to put\r\nin whatever he does a sincere longing for truth, to like what is\r\nbeautiful, both as to form and contents, to feel the necessity of\r\nbeing a useful unit amidst other human units, and thus to feel his\r\nheart at unison with the rest of humanity.\r\n\r\nAs for avoiding the monotony of work which would result from the\r\npupil always making mere cylinders and discs, and never making full\r\nmachines or other useful things, there are thousands of means for\r\navoiding that want of interest, and one of them, in use at Moscow, is\r\nworthy of notice. It was, not to give work for mere exercise, but to\r\nutilise everything which the pupil makes, from his very first steps.\r\nDo you remember how you were delighted, in your childhood, if your\r\nwork was utilised, be it only as a part of something useful? So they\r\ndid at Moscow. Each plank planed by the pupils was utilised as a part\r\nof some machine in some of the other workshops. When a pupil came to\r\nthe engineering workshop, and was set to make a quadrangular block\r\nof iron with parallel and perpendicular surfaces, the block had an\r\ninterest in his eyes, because, when he had finished it, verified its\r\nangles and surfaces, and corrected its defects, the block was not\r\nthrown under the bench--it was given to a more advanced pupil, who\r\nmade a handle to it, painted the whole, and sent it to the shop of\r\nthe school as a paper-weight. The systematical teaching thus received\r\nthe necessary attractiveness.[192]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that celerity of work is a most important factor in\r\nproduction. So it might be asked if, under the above system, the\r\nnecessary speed of work could be obtained. But there are two kinds\r\nof celerity. There is the celerity which I saw in a Nottingham\r\nlace-factory: full-grown men, with shivering hands and heads,\r\nwere feverishly binding together the ends of two threads from the\r\nremnants of cotton-yarn in the bobbins; you hardly could follow their\r\nmovements. But the very fact of requiring such kind of rapid work\r\nis the condemnation of the factory system. What has remained of the\r\nhuman being in those shivering bodies? What will be their outcome?\r\nWhy this waste of human force, when it could produce ten times the\r\nvalue of the odd rests of yarn? This kind of celerity is required\r\nexclusively because of the cheapness of the factory slaves; so let us\r\nhope that no school will ever aim at this kind of quickness in work.\r\n\r\nBut there is also the time-saving celerity of the well-trained\r\nworker, and this is surely achieved best by the kind of education\r\nwhich we advocate. However plain his work, the educated worker makes\r\nit better and quicker than the uneducated. Observe, for instance,\r\nhow a good worker proceeds in cutting anything--say a piece of\r\ncardboard--and compare his movements with those of an improperly\r\ntrained worker. The latter seizes the cardboard, takes the tool\r\nas it is, traces a line in a haphazard way, and begins to cut;\r\nhalf-way he is tired, and when he has finished his work is worth\r\nnothing; whereas, the former will examine his tool and improve it\r\nif necessary; he will trace the line with exactitude, secure both\r\ncardboard and rule, keep the tool in the right way, cut quite easily,\r\nand give you a piece of good work.\r\n\r\nThis is the true time-saving celerity, the most appropriate for\r\neconomising human labour; and the best means for attaining it is an\r\neducation of the most superior kind. The great masters painted with\r\nan astonishing rapidity; but their rapid work was the result of a\r\ngreat development of intelligence and imagination, of a keen sense\r\nof beauty, of a fine perception of colours. And that is the kind of\r\nrapid work of which humanity is in need.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMuch more ought to be said as regards the duties of the school, but\r\nI hasten to say a few words more as to the desirability of the kind\r\nof education briefly sketched in the preceding pages. Certainly, I do\r\nnot cherish the illusion that a thorough reform in education, or in\r\nany of the issues indicated in the preceding chapters, will be made\r\nas long as the civilised nations remain under the present narrowly\r\negotistic system of production and consumption. All we can expect, as\r\nlong as the present conditions last, is to have some microscopical\r\nattempts at reforming here and there on a small scale--attempts which\r\nnecessarily will prove to be far below the expected results, because\r\nof the impossibility of reforming on a small scale when so intimate\r\na connection exists between the manifold functions of a civilised\r\nnation. But the energy of the constructive genius of society depends\r\nchiefly upon the depths of its conception as to what ought to be\r\ndone, and how; and the necessity of re-casting education is one of\r\nthose necessities which are most comprehensible to all, and are most\r\nappropriate for inspiring society with those ideals, without which\r\nstagnation or even decay are unavoidable.\r\n\r\nSo let us suppose that a community--a city, or a territory which has,\r\nat least, a few millions of inhabitants--gives the above-sketched\r\neducation to all its children, without distinction of birth (and we\r\n_are_ rich enough to permit us the luxury of such an education),\r\nwithout asking anything in return from the children but what they\r\nwill give when they have become producers of wealth. Suppose such an\r\neducation is given, and analyse its probable consequences.\r\n\r\nI will not insist upon the increase of wealth which would result\r\nfrom having a young army of educated and well-trained producers; nor\r\nshall I insist upon the social benefits which would be derived from\r\nerasing the present distinction between the brain workers and the\r\nmanual workers, and from thus reaching the concordance of interest\r\nand harmony so much wanted in our times of social struggles. I shall\r\nnot dwell upon the fulness of life which would result for each\r\nseparate individual, if he were enabled to enjoy the use of both\r\nhis mental and bodily powers; nor upon the advantages of raising\r\nmanual labour to the place of honour it ought to occupy in society,\r\ninstead of being a stamp of inferiority, as it is now. Nor shall I\r\ninsist upon the disappearance of the present misery and degradation,\r\nwith all their consequences--vice, crime, prisons, price of blood,\r\ndenunciation, and the like--which necessarily would follow. In short,\r\nI will not touch now the great social question, upon which so much\r\nhas been written and so much remains to be written yet. I merely\r\nintend to point out in these pages the benefits which science itself\r\nwould derive from the change.\r\n\r\nSome will say, of course, that to reduce men of science to the\r\n_rôle_ of manual workers would mean the decay of science and genius.\r\nBut those who will take into account the following considerations\r\nprobably will agree that the result ought to be the reverse--namely,\r\nsuch a revival of science and art, and such a progress in industry,\r\nas we only can faintly foresee from what we know about the times of\r\nthe Renaissance. It has become a commonplace to speak with emphasis\r\nabout the progress of science during the nineteenth century; and it\r\nis evident that our century, if compared with centuries past, has\r\nmuch to be proud of. But, if we take into account that most of the\r\nproblems which our century has solved already had been indicated, and\r\ntheir solutions foreseen, a hundred years ago, we must admit that\r\nthe progress was not so rapid as might have been expected, and that\r\nsomething hampered it.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical theory of heat was very well foreseen in the last\r\ncentury by Rumford and Humphry Davy, and even in Russia it was\r\nadvocated by Lomonosoff.[193] However, much more than half a century\r\nelapsed before the theory reappeared in science. Lamarck, and even\r\nLinnæus, Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Erasmus Darwin, and several others\r\nwere fully aware of the variability of species; they were opening the\r\nway for the construction of biology on the principles of variation;\r\nbut here, again, half a century was wasted before the variability\r\nof species was brought again to the front; and we all remember\r\nhow Darwin’s ideas were carried on and forced on the attention of\r\nuniversity people, chiefly by persons who were not professional\r\nscientists themselves; and yet in Darwin’s hands the theory of\r\nevolution surely was narrowed, owing to the overwhelming importance\r\ngiven to only one factor of evolution.\r\n\r\nFor many years past astronomy has been needing a careful revision of\r\nthe Kant and Laplace’s hypothesis; but no theory is yet forthcoming\r\nwhich would compel general acceptance. Geology surely has made\r\nwonderful progress in the reconstitution of the palæontological\r\nrecord, but dynamical geology progresses at a despairingly slow\r\nrate; while all future progress in the great question as to the laws\r\nof distribution of living organisms on the surface of the earth is\r\nhampered by the want of knowledge as to the extension of glaciation\r\nduring the Quaternary epoch.[194]\r\n\r\nIn short, in each branch of science a revision of the current\r\ntheories as well as new wide generalisations are wanted. And if the\r\nrevision requires some of that inspiration of genius which moved\r\nGalileo and Newton, and which depends in its appearance upon general\r\ncauses of human development, it requires also an increase in the\r\nnumber of scientific workers. When facts contradictory to current\r\ntheories become numerous, the theories must be revised (we saw it\r\nin Darwin’s case), and thousands of simple intelligent workers in\r\nscience are required to accumulate the necessary facts.\r\n\r\nImmense regions of the earth still remain unexplored; the study of\r\nthe geographical distribution of animals and plants meets with\r\nstumbling-blocks at every step. Travellers cross continents, and\r\ndo not know even how to determine the latitude nor how to manage a\r\nbarometer. Physiology, both of plants and animals, psycho-physiology,\r\nand the psychological faculties of man and animals are so many\r\nbranches of knowledge requiring more data of the simplest\r\ndescription. History remains a _fable convenue_ chiefly because it\r\nwants fresh ideas, but also because it wants scientifically thinking\r\nworkers to reconstitute the life of past centuries in the same way as\r\nThorold Rogers or Augustin Thierry have done it for separate epochs.\r\n\r\nIn short, there is not one single science which does not suffer\r\nin its development from a want of men and women endowed with a\r\nphilosophical conception of the universe, ready to apply their\r\nforces of investigation in a given field, however limited, and\r\nhaving leisure for devoting themselves to scientific pursuits. In a\r\ncommunity such as we suppose, thousands of workers would be ready to\r\nanswer any appeal for exploration. Darwin spent almost thirty years\r\nin gathering and analysing facts for the elaboration of the theory of\r\nthe origin of species. Had he lived in such a society as we suppose,\r\nhe simply would have made an appeal to volunteers for facts and\r\npartial exploration, and thousands of explorers would have answered\r\nhis appeal. Scores of societies would have come to life to debate and\r\nto solve each of the partial problems involved in the theory, and\r\nin ten years the theory would have been verified; all those factors\r\nof evolution which only now begin to receive due attention would\r\nhave appeared in their full light. The rate of scientific progress\r\nwould have been tenfold; and if the individual would not have the\r\nsame claims on posterity’s gratitude as he has now, the unknown mass\r\nwould have done the work with more speed and with more prospect for\r\nulterior advance than the individual could do in his lifetime. Mr.\r\nMurray’s dictionary is an illustration of that kind of work--the work\r\nof the future.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is another feature of modern science which speaks\r\nmore strongly yet in favour of the change we advocate. While\r\nindustry, especially by the end of the last century and during the\r\nfirst part of the present, has been inventing on such a scale as to\r\nrevolutionise the very face of the earth, science has been losing its\r\ninventive powers. Men of science invent no more, or very little. Is\r\nit not striking, indeed, that the steam-engine, even in its leading\r\nprinciples, the railway-engine, the steam-boat, the telephone, the\r\nphonograph, the weaving-machine, the lace-machine, the lighthouse,\r\nthe macadamised road, photography in black and in colours, and\r\nthousands of less important things, have _not_ been invented by\r\nprofessional men of science, although none of them would have refused\r\nto associate his name with any of the above-named inventions? Men\r\nwho hardly had received any education at school, who had merely\r\npicked up the crumbs of knowledge from the tables of the rich,\r\nand who made their experiments with the most primitive means--the\r\nattorney’s clerk Smeaton, the instrument-maker Watt, the brakesman\r\nStephenson, the jeweller’s apprentice Fulton, the millwright Rennie,\r\nthe mason Telford, and hundreds of others whose very names remain\r\nunknown, were, as Mr. Smiles justly says, “the real makers of modern\r\ncivilisation”; while the professional men of science, provided\r\nwith all means for acquiring knowledge and experimenting, have\r\ninvented little in the formidable array of implements, machines, and\r\nprime-motors which has shown to humanity how to utilise and to manage\r\nthe forces of nature.[195] The fact is striking, but its explanation\r\nis very simple: those men--the Watts and the Stephensons--knew\r\nsomething which the _savants_ do not know--they knew the use of their\r\nhands; their surroundings stimulated their inventive powers; they\r\nknew machines, their leading principles, and their work; they had\r\nbreathed the atmosphere of the workshop and the building-yard.\r\n\r\nWe know how men of science will meet the reproach. They will say: “We\r\ndiscover the laws of nature, let others apply them; it is a simple\r\ndivision of labour.” But such a rejoinder would be utterly untrue.\r\nThe march of progress is quite the reverse, because in a hundred\r\ncases against one the mechanical invention comes before the discovery\r\nof the scientific law. It was not the dynamical theory of heat which\r\ncame before the steam-engine--it followed it.\r\n\r\nWhen thousands of engines already were transforming heat into motion\r\nunder the eyes of hundreds of professors, and when they had done\r\nso for half a century, or more; when thousands of trains, stopped\r\nby powerful brakes, were disengaging heat and spreading sheaves\r\nof sparks on the rails at their approach to the stations; when\r\nall over the civilised world heavy hammers and perforators were\r\nrendering burning hot the masses of iron they were hammering and\r\nperforating--then, and then only, Séguin, senior, in France, and\r\na doctor, Mayer, in Germany, ventured to bring out the mechanical\r\ntheory of heat with all its consequences: and yet the men of science\r\nignored the work of Séguin and almost drove Mayer to madness by\r\nobstinately clinging to their mysterious caloric fluid. Worse than\r\nthat, they described Joule’s first determination of the mechanical\r\nequivalent of heat as “unscientific.”\r\n\r\nWhen thousands of engines had been illustrating for some time the\r\nimpossibility of utilising all the heat disengaged by a given amount\r\nof burnt fuel, then came the second law of Clausius. When all over\r\nthe world industry already was transforming motion into heat, sound,\r\nlight, and electricity, and each one into each other, then only came\r\nGrove’s theory of the “correlation of physical forces”; and Grove’s\r\nwork had the same fate before the Royal Society as Joule’s. The\r\npublication of his memoir was refused till the year 1856.\r\n\r\nIt was not the theory of electricity which gave us the telegraph.\r\nWhen the telegraph was invented, all we knew about electricity\r\nwas but a few facts more or less badly arranged in our books; the\r\ntheory of electricity is not ready yet; it still waits for its\r\nNewton, notwithstanding the brilliant attempts of late years. Even\r\nthe empirical knowledge of the laws of electrical currents was in\r\nits infancy when a few bold men laid a cable at the bottom of the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, despite the warnings of the authorised men of science.\r\n\r\nThe name of “applied science” is quite misleading, because, in the\r\ngreat majority of cases, invention, far from being an application\r\nof science, on the contrary creates a new branch of science. The\r\nAmerican bridges were no application of the theory of elasticity;\r\nthey came before the theory, and all we can say in favour of science\r\nis, that in this special branch, theory and practice developed\r\nin a parallel way, helping one another. It was not the theory of\r\nthe explosives which led to the discovery of gunpowder; gunpowder\r\nwas in use for centuries before the action of the gases in a gun\r\nwas submitted to scientific analysis. And so on. One could easily\r\nmultiply the illustrations by quoting the great processes of\r\nmetallurgy; the alloys and the properties they acquire from the\r\naddition of very small amounts of some metals or metalloids; the\r\nrecent revival of electric lighting; nay, even the weather forecasts\r\nwhich truly deserved the reproach of being “unscientific” when\r\nthey were started for the first time by that excellent observer\r\nof shooting stars, Mathieu de la Drôme, and by an old Jack tar,\r\nFitzroy--all these could be mentioned as instances in point.\r\n\r\nOf course, we have a number of cases in which the discovery, or the\r\ninvention, was a mere application of a scientific law (cases like\r\nthe discovery of the planet Neptune), but in the immense majority of\r\ncases the discovery, or the invention, is unscientific to begin with.\r\nIt belongs much more to the domain of art--art taking the precedence\r\nover science, as Helmholtz has so well shown in one of his popular\r\nlectures--and only after the invention has been made, science comes\r\nto interpret it. It is obvious that each invention avails itself of\r\nthe previously accumulated knowledge and modes of thought; but in\r\nmost cases it makes a start in advance upon what is known; it makes\r\na leap in the unknown, and thus opens a quite new series of facts\r\nfor investigation. This character of invention, which is to make a\r\nstart in advance of former knowledge, instead of merely applying a\r\nlaw, makes it identical, as to the processes of mind, with discovery;\r\nand, therefore, people who are slow in invention are also slow in\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, the inventor, however inspired by the general state\r\nof science at a given moment, starts with a very few settled\r\nfacts at his disposal. The scientific facts taken into account for\r\ninventing the steam-engine, or the telegraph, or the phonograph were\r\nstrikingly elementary. So that we can affirm that what we presently\r\nknow is already sufficient for resolving any of the great problems\r\nwhich stand in the order of the day--prime-motors without the use\r\nof steam, the storage of energy, the transmission of force, or the\r\nflying-machine. If these problems are not yet solved, it is merely\r\nbecause of the want of inventive genius, the scarcity of educated\r\nmen endowed with it, and the present divorce between science and\r\nindustry.[196] On the one side, we have men who are endowed with\r\ncapacities for invention, but have neither the necessary scientific\r\nknowledge nor the means for experimenting during long years; and, on\r\nthe other side, we have men endowed with knowledge and facilities\r\nfor experimenting, but devoid of inventive genius, owing to their\r\neducation, too abstract, too scholastic, too bookish, and to the\r\nsurroundings they live in--not to speak of the patent system,\r\nwhich divides and scatters the efforts of the inventors instead of\r\ncombining them.[197]\r\n\r\nThe flight of genius which has characterised the workers at the\r\noutset of modern industry has been missing in our professional men\r\nof science. And they will not recover it as long as they remain\r\nstrangers to the world, amidst their dusty bookshelves; as long\r\nas they are not workers themselves, amidst other workers, at the\r\nblaze of the iron furnace, at the machine in the factory, at the\r\nturning-lathe in the engineering workshop; sailors amidst sailors on\r\nthe sea, and fishers in the fishing-boat, wood-cutters in the forest,\r\ntillers of the soil in the field.\r\n\r\nOur teachers in art--Ruskin and his school--have repeatedly told\r\nus of late that we must not expect a revival of art as long as\r\nhandicraft remains what it is; they have shown how Greek and mediæval\r\nart were daughters of handicraft, how one was feeding the other. The\r\nsame is true with regard to handicraft and science; their separation\r\nis the decay of both. As to the grand inspirations which unhappily\r\nhave been so much neglected in most of the recent discussions about\r\nart--and which are missing in science as well--these can be expected\r\nonly when humanity, breaking its present bonds, shall make a new\r\nstart in the higher principles of solidarity, doing away with the\r\npresent duality of moral sense and philosophy.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, however, that all men and women cannot equally enjoy\r\nthe pursuit of scientific work. The variety of inclinations is such\r\nthat some will find more pleasure in science, some others in art, and\r\nothers again in some of the numberless branches of the production of\r\nwealth. But, whatever the occupations preferred by everyone, everyone\r\nwill be the more useful in his own branch if he is in possession of a\r\nserious scientific knowledge. And, whosoever he might be--scientist\r\nor artist, physicist or surgeon, chemist or sociologist, historian\r\nor poet--he would be the gainer if he spent a part of his life in\r\nthe workshop or the farm (the workshop _and_ the farm), if he were\r\nin contact with humanity in its daily work, and had the satisfaction\r\nof knowing that he himself discharges his duties as an unprivileged\r\nproducer of wealth.\r\n\r\nHow much better the historian and the sociologist would understand\r\nhumanity if they knew it, not in books only, not in a few of its\r\nrepresentatives, but as a whole, in its daily life, daily work, and\r\ndaily affairs! How much more medicine would trust to hygiene, and\r\nhow much less to prescriptions, if the young doctors were the nurses\r\nof the sick and the nurses received the education of the doctors of\r\nour time! And how much the poet would gain in his feeling of the\r\nbeauties of nature, how much better would he know the human heart,\r\nif he met the rising sun amidst the tillers of the soil, himself a\r\ntiller; if he fought against the storm with the sailors on board\r\nship; if he knew the poetry of labour and rest, sorrow and joy,\r\nstruggle and conquest! _Greift nur hinein in’s volle Menschenleben!_\r\nGoethe said; _Ein jeder lebt’s--nicht vielen ist’s bekannt._ But how\r\nfew poets follow his advice!\r\n\r\nThe so-called “division of labour” has grown under a system which\r\ncondemned the masses to toil all the day long, and all the life long,\r\nat the same wearisome kind of labour. But if we take into account\r\nhow few are the real producers of wealth in our present society, and\r\nhow squandered is their labour, we must recognise that Franklin was\r\nright in saying that to work five hours a day would generally do for\r\nsupplying each member of a civilised nation with the comfort now\r\naccessible for the few only.\r\n\r\nBut we have made some progress since Franklin’s time, and\r\nsome of that progress in the hitherto most backward branch of\r\nproduction--agriculture--has been indicated in the preceding\r\npages. Even in that branch the productivity of labour can be\r\nimmensely increased, and work itself rendered easy and pleasant.\r\nIf everyone took his share of production, and if production were\r\nsocialised--as political economy, if it aimed at the satisfaction of\r\nthe ever-growing needs of all, would advise us to do--then more than\r\none half of the working day would remain to everyone for the pursuit\r\nof art, science, or any hobby he or she might prefer; and his work in\r\nthose fields would be the more profitable if he spent the other half\r\nof the day in productive work--if art and science were followed from\r\nmere inclination, not for mercantile purposes. Moreover, a community\r\norganised on the principles of all being workers would be rich\r\nenough to conclude that every man and woman, after having reached\r\na certain age--say of forty or more--ought to be relieved from the\r\nmoral obligation of taking a direct part in the performance of the\r\nnecessary manual work, so as to be able entirely to devote himself\r\nor herself to whatever he or she chooses in the domain of art, or\r\nscience, or any kind of work. Free pursuit in new branches of art and\r\nknowledge, free creation, and free development thus might be fully\r\nguaranteed. And such a community would not know misery amidst wealth.\r\nIt would not know the duality of conscience which permeates our\r\nlife and stifles every noble effort. It would freely take its flight\r\ntowards the highest regions of progress compatible with human nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[185] In their examination of the causes of unemployment in York,\r\nbased not on economists’ hypotheses, but on a close study of the\r\nreal facts in each individual case (_Unemployment: a Social Study_,\r\nLondon, 1911), Seebohm Rowntree and Mr. Bruno Lasker have come to the\r\nconclusion that the chief cause of unemployment is that young people,\r\nafter having left the school (where they learn no trade), find\r\nemployment in such professions as greengrocer boy, newspaper boy, and\r\nthe like, which represent “a blind alley.” When they reach the age of\r\neighteen or twenty, they must leave, because the wages are a boy’s\r\nwages,--and they know no trade whatever!\r\n\r\n[186] Unfortunately, I must already say “admitted” instead of\r\n“admits.” With the reaction which began after 1881, under the reign\r\nof Alexander III., this school was “reformed”; that means that all\r\nthe spirit and the system of the school were destroyed.\r\n\r\n[187] _Manual Training: the Solution of Social and Industrial\r\nProblems._ By Ch. H. Ham. London: Blackie & Son, 1886. I can add that\r\nlike results were achieved also at the Krasnoufimsk _Realschule_, in\r\nthe province of Orenburg, especially with regard to agriculture and\r\nagricultural machinery. The achievements of the school, however, are\r\nso interesting that they deserve more than a short mention.\r\n\r\n[188] It is evident that the Gordon’s College industrial department\r\nis not a mere copy of any foreign school; on the contrary, I cannot\r\nhelp thinking that if Aberdeen has made that excellent move towards\r\ncombining science with handicraft, the move was a natural outcome\r\nof what has been practised long since, on a smaller scale, in the\r\nAberdeen daily schools.\r\n\r\n[189] What this school is now, I don’t know. In the first years\r\nof Alexander III.’s reign it was wrecked, like so many other good\r\ninstitutions of the early part of the reign of Alexander II. But the\r\nsystem was not lost. It was carried over to America.\r\n\r\n[190] To those readers who are really interested in the education of\r\nchildren, M. Leray, the French translator of this book, recommended\r\na series of excellent little works “conceived,” he wrote, “in the\r\nvery spirit of the ideas developed in this chapter. Their leading\r\nprinciple is that ‘in order to be soundly educative, all teaching\r\nmust be objective, especially at the outset,’ and that ‘systematical\r\nabstraction, if it be introduced into the teaching without an\r\nobjective (concrete) preparation, is noxious.’” M. Leray meant the\r\nseries of initiations published by the French publishers, Hachette:\r\n_Initiation mathématique_, by C. A. Laisant, a book completed by the\r\n_Initiateur mathématique_, which is a game with small cubes, very\r\ningenious and giving in a concrete form the proofs of arithmetics,\r\nthe metric system, algebra and geometry; _Initiation astronomique_,\r\nby C. Flammarion; _Initiation chimique_, by Georges Darzens;\r\n_Initiation à la mécanique_, by Ch. Ed. Guillaume; and _Initiation\r\nzoologique_, by E. Brucker. The authors of these works had--it\r\nwould not be just not to mention it--predecessors in Jean Mace’s\r\n_L’Arithmétique du grand-papa_, and René Leblanc, “whose excellent\r\nmanual, _Les Sciences physiques à l’Ecole primaire_”--M. Leray says\r\nthat from his own experience upon pupils from eleven to thirteen\r\nyears old--“gives even to the dullest children the taste or even the\r\npassion for physical experiment.”\r\n\r\n[191] Take, for instance, the description of Atwood’s machine in any\r\ncourse of elementary physics. You will find very great attention\r\npaid to the wheels on which the axle of the pulley is made to lie;\r\nhollow boxes, plates and rings, the clock, and other accessories will\r\nbe mentioned before one word is said upon the leading idea of the\r\nmachine, which is to slacken the motion of a falling body by making\r\na falling body of small weight move a heavier body which is in the\r\nstate of inertia, gravity acting on it in two opposite directions.\r\nThat was the inventor’s idea; and if it is made clear, the pupils\r\nsee at once that to suspend two bodies of equal weight over a\r\npulley, and to make them move by adding a small weight to one of\r\nthem, is one of the means (and a good one) for slackening the motion\r\nduring the falling; they see that the friction of the pulley must\r\nbe reduced to a minimum, either by using the two pairs of wheels,\r\nwhich so much puzzle the text-book makers, or by any other means;\r\nthat the clock is a luxury, and the “plates and rings” are mere\r\naccessories: in short, that Atwood’s idea can be realised with the\r\nwheel of a clock fastened, as a pulley, to a wall, or on the top of\r\na broomstick secured in a vertical position. In this case the pupils\r\nwill understand the _idea_ of the machine and of its inventor, and\r\nthey will accustom themselves to separate the leading idea from the\r\naccessories; while in the other case they merely look with curiosity\r\nat the tricks performed by the teacher with a complicated machine,\r\nand the few who finally understand it spend a quantity of time in the\r\neffort. In reality, all _apparatus used to illustrate the fundamental\r\nlaws of physics ought to be made by the children themselves_.\r\n\r\n[192] The sale of the pupils’ work was not insignificant, especially\r\nwhen they reached the higher classes, and made steam-engines.\r\nTherefore the Moscow school, when I knew it, was one of the cheapest\r\nin the world. It gave boarding and education at a very low fee. But\r\nimagine such a school connected with a farm school, which grows\r\nfood and exchanges it at its cost price. What will be the cost of\r\neducation then?\r\n\r\n[193] In an otherwise also remarkable memoir on the Arctic Regions.\r\n\r\n[194] The rate of progress in the recently so popular Glacial Period\r\nquestion was strikingly slow. Already Venetz in 1821 and Esmarck\r\nin 1823 had explained the erratic phenomena by the glaciation of\r\nEurope. Agassiz came forth with the glaciation of the Alps, the Jura\r\nmountains, and Scotland, about 1840; and five years later, Guyot had\r\npublished his maps of the routes followed by Alpine boulders. But\r\nforty-two years elapsed after Venetz wrote before one geologist of\r\nmark (Lyell) dared timidly to accept his theory, even to a limited\r\nextent--the most interesting fact being that Guyot’s maps, considered\r\nas irrelevant in 1845, were recognised as conclusive after 1863. Even\r\nnow--more than half a century after Agassiz’s first work--Agassiz’s\r\nviews are not yet either refuted or generally accepted. So also\r\nForbes’s views upon the plasticity of ice. Let me add, by the way,\r\nthat the whole polemics as to the viscosity of ice is a striking\r\ninstance of how facts, scientific terms, and experimental methods\r\nquite familiar to building engineers, were ignored by those who took\r\npart in the polemics. If these facts, terms and methods were taken\r\ninto account, the polemics would not have raged for years with no\r\nresult. Like instances, to show how science suffers from a want of\r\nacquaintance with facts and methods of experimenting both well known\r\nto engineers, florists, cattle-breeders, and so on, could be produced\r\nin numbers.\r\n\r\n[195] Chemistry is, to a great extent, an exception to the rule. Is\r\nit not because the chemist is to such an extent a manual worker?\r\nBesides, during the last ten years we see a decided revival in\r\nscientific inventiveness, especially in physics--that is, in a branch\r\nin which the engineer and the man of science meet so much together.\r\n\r\n[196] I leave on purpose these lines as they were in the first\r\nedition. All these desiderata are already accomplished facts.\r\n\r\n[197] The same remark ought to be made as regards the sociologists,\r\nand still more so the economists. What are most of them, including\r\nthe socialists, doing, but studying chiefly the books previously\r\nwritten and the systems, instead of studying the _facts_ of the\r\neconomical life of the nations, and the thousands of attempts at\r\ngiving to agriculture and industry new forms of organisation and new\r\nmethods, which are now made everywhere in Europe and America?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nReaders who have had the patience to follow the facts accumulated\r\nin this book, especially those who have given them a thoughtful\r\nattention, will probably feel convinced of the immense powers over\r\nthe productive forces of Nature that man has acquired within the\r\nlast half a century. Comparing the achievements indicated in this\r\nbook with the present state of production, some will, I hope, also\r\nask themselves the question which will be ere long, let us hope,\r\nthe main object of a scientific political economy: Are the means\r\nnow in use for satisfying human needs, under the present system of\r\npermanent division of functions and production for profits, really\r\n_economical_? Do they really lead to economy in the expenditure of\r\nhuman forces? Or, are they not mere wasteful survivals from a past\r\nthat was plunged into darkness, ignorance and oppression, and never\r\ntook into consideration the economical and social value of the human\r\nbeing?\r\n\r\nIn the domain of agriculture it may be taken as proved that if a\r\nsmall part only of the time that is now given in each nation or\r\nregion to field culture was given to well thought out and socially\r\ncarried out permanent improvements of the soil, the duration of work\r\nwhich would be required afterwards to grow the yearly bread-food for\r\nan average family of five would be less than a fortnight every year;\r\nand that the work required for that purpose would not be the hard\r\ntoil of the ancient slave, but work which would be agreeable to the\r\nphysical forces of every healthy man and woman in the country.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved that by following the methods of intensive\r\nmarket-gardening--partly under glass--vegetables and fruit can be\r\ngrown in such quantities that men could be provided with a rich\r\nvegetable food and a profusion of fruit, if they simply devoted to\r\nthe task of growing them the hours which everyone willingly devotes\r\nto work in the open air, after having spent most of his day in the\r\nfactory, the mine, or the study. Provided, of course, that the\r\nproduction of food-stuffs should not be the work of the isolated\r\nindividual, but the planned-out and combined action of human groups.\r\n\r\nIt has also been proved--and those who care to verify it by\r\nthemselves may easily do so by calculating the real expenditure for\r\nlabour which was lately made in the building of workmen’s houses by\r\nboth private persons and municipalities[198]--that under a proper\r\ncombination of labour, twenty to twenty-four months of one man’s\r\nwork would be sufficient to secure for ever, for a family of five,\r\nan apartment or a house provided with all the comforts which modern\r\nhygiene and taste could require.\r\n\r\nAnd it has been demonstrated by actual experiment that, by adopting\r\nmethods of education, advocated long since and partially applied\r\nhere and there, it is most easy to convey to children of an average\r\nintelligence, before they have reached the age of fourteen or\r\nfifteen, a broad general comprehension of Nature, as well as of\r\nhuman societies; to familiarise their minds with sound methods of\r\nboth scientific research and technical work, and inspire their\r\nhearts with a deep feeling of human solidarity and justice; and that\r\nit is extremely easy to convey during the next four or five years\r\na reasoned, scientific knowledge of Nature’s laws, as well as a\r\nknowledge, at once reasoned and practical, of the technical methods\r\nof satisfying man’s material needs. Far from being inferior to the\r\n“specialised” young persons manufactured by our universities, the\r\n_complete_ human being, trained to use his brain and his hands,\r\nexcels them, on the contrary, in all respects, especially as an\r\ninitiator and an inventor in both science and technics.\r\n\r\nAll this has been proved. It is an acquisition of the times we\r\nlive in--an acquisition which has been won despite the innumerable\r\nobstacles always thrown in the way of every initiative mind. It has\r\nbeen won by the obscure tillers of the soil, from whose hands greedy\r\nStates, landlords and middlemen snatch the fruit of their labour\r\neven before it is ripe; by obscure teachers who only too often fall\r\ncrushed under the weight of Church, State, commercial competition,\r\ninertia of mind and prejudice.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in the presence of all these conquests--what is the reality\r\nof things?\r\n\r\nNine-tenths of the whole population of grain-exporting countries\r\nlike Russia, one-half of it in countries like France which live on\r\nhome-grown food, work upon the land--most of them in the same way\r\nas the slaves of antiquity did, only to obtain a meagre crop from\r\na soil, and with a machinery which they cannot improve, because\r\ntaxation, rent and usury keep them always as near as possible to the\r\nmargin of starvation. In this twentieth century, whole populations\r\nstill plough with the same plough as their mediæval ancestors, live\r\nin the same incertitude of the morrow, and are as carefully denied\r\neducation as their ancestors; and they have, in claiming their\r\nportion of bread, to march with their children and wives against\r\ntheir own sons’ bayonets, as their grandfathers did hundreds of years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nIn industrially developed countries, a couple of months’ work, or\r\neven much less than that, would be sufficient to produce for a family\r\na rich and varied vegetable and animal food. But the researches of\r\nEngel (at Berlin) and his many followers tell us that the workman’s\r\nfamily has to spend one full half of its yearly earnings--that is,\r\nto give six months of labour, and often more--to provide its food.\r\nAnd what food! Is not bread and dripping the staple food of more than\r\none-half of English children?\r\n\r\nOne month of work every year would be quite sufficient to provide\r\nthe worker with a healthy dwelling. But it is from 25 to 40 per\r\ncent. of his yearly earnings--that is, from three to five months of\r\nhis working time every year--that he has to spend in order to get\r\na dwelling, in most cases unhealthy and far too small; and this\r\ndwelling will never be his own, even though at the age of forty-five\r\nor fifty he is sure to be sent away from the factory, because the\r\nwork that he used to do will by that time be accomplished by a\r\nmachine and a child.\r\n\r\nWe all know that the child ought, at least, to be familiarised with\r\nthe forces of Nature which some day he will have to utilise; that\r\nhe ought to be prepared to keep pace in his life with the steady\r\nprogress of science and technics; that he ought to study science and\r\nlearn a trade. Everyone will grant thus much; but what do we do? From\r\nthe age of ten or even nine we send the child to push a coal-cart in\r\na mine, or to bind, with a little monkey’s agility, the two ends of\r\nthreads broken in a spinning gin. From the age of thirteen we compel\r\nthe girl--a child yet--to work as a “woman” at the weaving-loom,\r\nor to stew in the poisoned, over-heated air of a cotton-dressing\r\nfactory, or, perhaps, to be poisoned in the death chambers of a\r\nStaffordshire pottery. As to those who have the relatively rare\r\nluck of receiving some more education, we crush their minds by\r\nuseless overtime, we consciously deprive them of all possibility of\r\nthemselves becoming producers; and under an educational system of\r\nwhich the motive is “profits,” and the means “specialisation,” we\r\nsimply work to death the women teachers who take their educational\r\nduties in earnest. What floods of useless sufferings deluge every\r\nso-called civilised land in the world!\r\n\r\nWhen we look back on ages past, and see there the same sufferings,\r\nwe may say that perhaps then they were unavoidable on account of the\r\nignorance which prevailed. But human genius, stimulated by our modern\r\nRenaissance, has already indicated new paths to follow.\r\n\r\nFor thousands of years in succession to grow one’s food was the\r\nburden, almost the curse, of mankind. But it need be so no more.\r\nIf you make yourselves the soil, and partly the temperature and\r\nthe moisture which each crop requires, you will see that to grow\r\nthe yearly food of a family, under rational conditions of culture,\r\nrequires so little labour that it might almost be done as a mere\r\nchange from other pursuits. If you return to the soil, and co-operate\r\nwith your neighbours instead of erecting high walls to conceal\r\nyourself from their looks; if you utilise what experiment has already\r\ntaught us, and call to your aid science and technical invention,\r\nwhich never fail to answer to the call--look only at what they have\r\ndone for warfare--you will be astonished at the facility with which\r\nyou can bring a rich and varied food out of the soil. You will admire\r\nthe amount of sound knowledge which your children will acquire by\r\nyour side, the rapid growth of their intelligence, and the facility\r\nwith which they will grasp the laws of Nature, animate and inanimate.\r\n\r\nHave the factory and the workshop at the gates of your fields and\r\ngardens, and work in them. Not those large establishments, of course,\r\nin which huge masses of metals have to be dealt with and which are\r\nbetter placed at certain spots indicated by Nature, but the countless\r\nvariety of workshops and factories which are required to satisfy\r\nthe infinite diversity of tastes among civilised men. Not those\r\nfactories in which children lose all the appearance of children in\r\nthe atmosphere of an industrial hell, but those airy and hygienic,\r\nand consequently economical, factories in which human life is of more\r\naccount than machinery and the making of extra profits, of which we\r\nalready find a few samples here and there; factories and workshops\r\ninto which men, women and children will not be driven by hunger,\r\nbut will be attracted by the desire of finding an activity suited\r\nto their tastes, and where, aided by the motor and the machine,\r\nthey will choose the branch of activity which best suits their\r\ninclinations.\r\n\r\nLet those factories and workshops be erected, not for making profits\r\nby selling shoddy or useless and noxious things to enslaved Africans,\r\nbut to satisfy the unsatisfied needs of millions of Europeans. And\r\nagain, you will be struck to see with what facility and in how short\r\na time your needs of dress and of thousands of articles of luxury\r\ncan be satisfied, when production is carried on for satisfying real\r\nneeds rather than for satisfying shareholders by high profits or for\r\npouring gold into the pockets of promoters and bogus directors. Very\r\nsoon you will yourselves feel interested in that work, and you will\r\nhave occasion to admire in your children their eager desire to become\r\nacquainted with Nature and its forces, their inquisitive inquiries as\r\nto the powers of machinery, and their rapidly developing inventive\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nSuch is the future--already possible, already realisable; such is\r\nthe present--already condemned and about to disappear. And what\r\nprevents us from turning our backs to this present and from marching\r\ntowards that future, or, at least, making the first steps towards\r\nit, is not the “failure of science,” but first of all our crass\r\ncupidity--the cupidity of the man who killed the hen that was laying\r\ngolden eggs--and then our laziness of mind--that mental cowardice so\r\ncarefully nurtured in the past.\r\n\r\nFor centuries science and so-called practical wisdom have said to\r\nman: “It is good to be rich, to be able to satisfy, at least, your\r\nmaterial needs; but the only means to be rich is to so train your\r\nmind and capacities as to be able to compel other men--slaves, serfs\r\nor wage-earners--to make these riches for you. You have no choice.\r\nEither you must stand in the ranks of the peasants and the artisans\r\nwho, whatsoever economists and moralists may promise them in the\r\nfuture, are now periodically doomed to starve after each bad crop\r\nor during their strikes, and to be shot down by their own sons the\r\nmoment they lose patience. Or you must train your faculties so as to\r\nbe a military commander of the masses, or to be accepted as one of\r\nthe wheels of the governing machinery of the State, or to become a\r\nmanager of men in commerce or industry.” For many centuries there was\r\nno other choice, and men followed that advice, without finding in it\r\nhappiness, either for themselves and their own children, or for those\r\nwhom they pretended to preserve from worse misfortunes.\r\n\r\nBut modern knowledge has another issue to offer to thinking men. It\r\ntells them that in order to be rich they need not take the bread\r\nfrom the mouths of others; but that the more rational outcome would\r\nbe a society in which men, with the work of their own hands and\r\nintelligence, and by the aid of the machinery already invented and\r\nto be invented, should themselves create all imaginable riches.\r\nTechnics and science will not be lagging behind if production takes\r\nsuch a direction. Guided by observation, analysis and experiment,\r\nthey will answer all possible demands. They will reduce the time\r\nwhich is necessary for producing wealth to any desired amount, so as\r\nto leave to everyone as much leisure as he or she may ask for. They\r\nsurely cannot guarantee happiness, because happiness depends as much,\r\nor even more, upon the individual himself as upon his surroundings.\r\nBut they guarantee, at least, the happiness that can be found in the\r\nfull and varied exercise of the different capacities of the human\r\nbeing, in work that need not be overwork, and in the consciousness\r\nthat one is not endeavouring to base his own happiness upon the\r\nmisery of others.\r\n\r\nThese are the horizons which the above inquiry opens to the\r\nunprejudiced mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[198] These figures may be computed, for instance, from the data\r\ncontained in “The Ninth Annual Report of the Commissioner of\r\nLabour of the United States, for the year 1893: Building and Loan\r\nAssociations.” In this country the cost of a workman’s cottage is\r\nreckoned at about £200, which would represent 700 to 800 days of\r\nlabour. But we must not forget how much of this sum is a toll raised\r\nby the capitalists and the landlords upon everything that is used in\r\nbuilding the cottage: the bricks and tiles, the mortar, the wood, the\r\niron, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.--BRITISH INVESTMENTS ABROAD.\r\n\r\nThe important question as to the amount of British capital invested\r\nin the colonies and in other countries has only quite lately received\r\ndue attention. For the last ten years or so one could find in the\r\n“Reports of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue” a mention of the\r\nrevenue derived from British capital invested in foreign loans to\r\nStates and Municipalities and in railway companies; but these returns\r\nwere still incomplete. Consequently, Mr. George Paish made in 1909\r\nand 1911 an attempt at determining these figures with more accuracy\r\nin two papers which he read before the Statistical Society.[199]\r\n\r\nMr. Paish based his researches on the Income Tax, completing these\r\ndata by special researches about private investments, which do not\r\nappear in the Income Tax returns. He has not yet got to the end of\r\nhis investigation; but, all taken, he estimates that the yearly\r\nincome received by this country from abroad from different sources\r\nreaches £300,000,000 every year.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.--FRENCH IMPORTS.\r\n\r\nAbout one-tenth part of the cereals consumed in France is still\r\nimported; but, as will be seen in a subsequent chapter, the progress\r\nin agriculture has lately been so rapid that even without Algeria\r\nFrance will soon have a surplus of cereals. Wine is imported, but\r\nnearly as much is exported. So that coffee and oil-seeds remain\r\nthe only food articles of durable importance for import. For coal\r\nand coke France is still tributary to Belgium, to this country,\r\nand to Germany; but it is chiefly the inferiority of organisation\r\nof coal extraction which stands in the way of the home supply. The\r\nother important items of imports are: raw cotton (from £12,440,000\r\nto £18,040,000 in 1903-1910), raw wool (from £15,160,000 to\r\n£23,200,000), and raw silk (from £10,680,000 to £17,640,000), as well\r\nas hides and furs, oil-seeds, and machinery (about £10,000,000).\r\nThe exports of manufactured goods were £80,000,000 in 1890, and\r\nin subsequent years from £119,000,000 to £137,000,000. Exports of\r\ntextiles, exclusive of yarn and linen, £29,800,000 in 1890, and\r\n£34,440,000 in 1908-1910; while the imports of all textiles are\r\ninsignificant (from £5,000,000 to £7,000,000).\r\n\r\n\r\nC.--GROWTH OF INDUSTRY IN RUSSIA.\r\n\r\nThe growth of industry in Russia will be best seen from the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n                             1880-81.        1893-94.          1910.\r\n                               Cwts.

From less than 100,000 tons in 1860, the\r\nextraction of coal and anthracite rose to 16,840,460 metric tons in\r\n1910. The extraction of iron ore rose from 377,000 tons in 1890 to\r\n3,760,000 tons in 1909. The production of cast iron, which was only\r\n29,270 tons in 1882, reached 2,067,000 tons in 1910, and the amount\r\nof refined iron and steel and their produce rose from 27,830 tons in\r\n1882 to 1,641,960 tons in 1910. In short, South Russia is becoming\r\nan exporting centre for the iron industry. (P.

Schulze-Gaewernitz, in his excellent work, _The Cotton Trade\r\nin England and on the Continent_ (English translation by Oscar S.\r\nHall, London, 1895), called attention to the fact that Germany\r\nhad certainly not yet attained, in her cotton industry, the high\r\ntechnical level of development attained by England; but he showed\r\nalso the progress realised. The cost of each yard of plain cotton,\r\nnotwithstanding low wages and long hours, was still greater in\r\nGermany than in England, as seen from the following tables. Taking a\r\ncertain quality of plain cotton in both countries, he gave (p. 151,\r\nGerman edition) the following comparative figures:--\r\n\r\n                                             England.       Germany.\r\n\r\n  Hours of labour                            9 hours        12 hours\r\n  Average weekly earnings of the operatives  16s. 3d.       11s. 8d.\r\n  Yards woven per week per operative         706 yards      466 yards\r\n  Cost per yard of cotton                    0·275d.        0·303d.\r\n\r\nBut he remarked also that in all sorts of printed cottons, in which\r\nfancy, colours and invention play a predominant part, _the advantages\r\nwere entirely on the side of the smaller German factories_.\r\n\r\nIn the spinning mills the advantages, on the contrary, continued to\r\nremain entirely on the side of England, the number of operatives per\r\n1,000 spindles being in various countries as follows (p. 91, English\r\nedition):--\r\n\r\n                    Per 1000 spindles.\r\n\r\n  Bombay              25 operatives.\r\n  Italy               13      ”\r\n  Alsace               9½     ”\r\n  Mulhouse             7½     ”\r\n  Germany, 1861       20 operatives.\r\n     ”     1882        8 to 9 ”\r\n  England, 1837        7      ”\r\n     ”     1887        3      ”\r\n\r\nConsiderable improvements had taken place already in the ten years\r\n1884-1894. “India shows us, since 1884, extraordinary developments,”\r\nSchulze-Gaewernitz remarked, and “there is no doubt that Germany also\r\nhas reduced the number of operatives per 1,000 spindles since the\r\nlast Inquest.” “From a great quantity of materials lying before me,\r\nI cull,” he wrote, “the following, which, however, refers solely to\r\nleading and technically distinguished spinning mills:--\r\n\r\n                                           Per 1000 spindles.\r\n\r\n  Switzerland                               6·2 operatives.\r\n  Mulhouse                                  5·8      ”\r\n  Baden and Würtemberg                      6·2      ”\r\n  Bavaria                                   6·8      ”\r\n  Saxony (new and splendid mills)           7·2      ”\r\n  Vosges, France (old spinning mills)       8·9      ”\r\n  Russia                                   16·6      ”\r\n\r\nThe average counts of yarn for all these were between twenties and\r\nthirties.”\r\n\r\nIt is evident that considerable progress has been realised since\r\nSchulze-Gaewernitz wrote these lines. As an exporter of cotton yarn\r\nand cottons, Germany has made rapid strides. Thus, in 1903, she\r\nexported £1,625,000 worth of cotton yarn, and £15,080,000 worth of\r\ncottons. For 1910 the figures given by the _Statistisches Jahrbuch\r\nfor 1911_ were already £2,740,000 and £18,255,000 respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nG.--MINING AND TEXTILES IN AUSTRIA.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the development of industries in Austria-Hungary,\r\nit is sufficient to mention the growth of her mining industries and\r\nthe present state of her textile industries.\r\n\r\nThe value of the yearly extraction of coal and iron ore in Austria\r\nappears as follows:--\r\n\r\n                            1880.          1890.          1910.\r\n\r\n  Coal                  £1,611,000    £25,337,000    £57,975,000\r\n  Brown coal             1,281,300     23,033,000     56,715,000\r\n  Raw iron               1,749,000     22,759,000     49,367,000\r\n\r\nAt the present time the exports of coal entirely balance the imports.\r\n\r\nAs to the textile industries, the imports of raw cotton into\r\nAustria-Hungary reached in 1907 the respectable value of £12,053,400.\r\nFor raw wool and wool yarn they were £6,055,600 worth, and for silk,\r\n£1,572,000; while £3,156,200 worth of woollens were exported.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census of 1902 (_Statistisches Jahrbuch for 1911_),\r\nthere were already, in Austria-Hungary, 1,408,855 industrial\r\nestablishments, occupying 4,049,320 workpeople, and having a\r\nmachinery representing 1,787,900 horse-power. The textile trades\r\nalone had in their service 257,500 horse-power (as against 113,280 in\r\n1890).\r\n\r\nThe small industry evidently prevailed, nearly one-half of all the\r\nworkpeople (2,066,120) being employed in 901,202 establishments,\r\nwhich had only from one to twenty persons each; while 443,235\r\nworkpeople were employed in 10,661 establishments (from twenty-one to\r\n100 workpeople each). Still, the great industry has already made its\r\nappearance in some branches--there being 3,021 establishments which\r\nemployed more than 100 workers each, and representing an aggregate of\r\n1,053,790 workpeople. Out of them 105 establishments employed even\r\nmore than 1,000 persons each (115 establishments, 179,876 workpeople\r\nin 1910).\r\n\r\nIn Hungary industry is also rapidly developing; it occupied 1,127,130\r\npersons in 1902 (34,160 in the textiles, and 74,000 in mining). In\r\n1910 the exports of all textiles (stuffs and yarns) from Hungary\r\nreached the sum of £7,040,500.\r\n\r\n\r\nH.--COTTON MANUFACTURE IN INDIA.\r\n\r\nThe views taken in the text about the industrial development of\r\nIndia are confirmed by a mass of evidence. One of them, coming from\r\nauthorised quarters, deserves special attention. In an article on the\r\nprogress of the Indian cotton manufacture, the _Textile Recorder_\r\n(15th October, 1888) wrote:--\r\n\r\n“No person connected with the cotton industry can be ignorant of the\r\nrapid progress of the cotton manufacture in India. Statistics of\r\nall kinds have recently been brought before the public, showing the\r\nincrease of production in the country; still it does not seem to be\r\nclearly understood that this increasing output of cotton goods must\r\nseriously lower the demand upon Lancashire mills, and that it is not\r\nby any means improbable that India may at no very distant period be\r\nno better customer than the United States is now.”\r\n\r\nOne hardly need add at what price the Indian manufacturers obtain\r\ncheap cottons. The report of the Bombay Factory Commission which\r\nwas laid before Parliament in August, 1888, contained facts of such\r\nhorrible cruelty and cupidity as would hardly be imagined by those\r\nwho have forgotten the disclosures of the inquiry made in this\r\ncountry in 1840-1842. The factory engines are at work, as a rule,\r\nfrom 5 A.M. till 7, 8, or 9 P.M., and the workers remain at work for\r\ntwelve, thirteen, fourteen hours, only releasing one another for\r\nmeals. In busy times it happens that the same set of workers remain\r\nat the gins and presses night and day with half an hour’s rest in the\r\nevening. In some factories the workers have their meals at the gins,\r\nand are so worn out after eight and ten days’ uninterrupted work that\r\nthey supply the gins mechanically “three parts asleep.”\r\n\r\n“It is a sad tale of great want on one side, and cruel cupidity\r\non the other,” the official report concludes. However, it would\r\nbe absolutely erroneous to conclude that Indian manufactures can\r\ncompete with the British ones as long as they continue the terrible\r\nexploitation of human labour which we see now. Forty years ago the\r\nBritish manufactures offered absolutely the same terrible picture of\r\ncruel cupidity. But times will come when Indian workers will restrain\r\nthe cupidity of the capitalists, and the manufacturers of Bombay will\r\nbe none the worse for that in their competition with the British\r\nmanufactures.\r\n\r\nThe figures relative to the latest growth of the textile industries\r\nin India, given in the text, fully confirm the previsions expressed\r\ntwenty-five years ago. As to the conditions of the workpeople in the\r\nIndian cotton-mills, they continue to remain abominable.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--THE COTTON INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nA few years ago the cotton industry in the United States attracted\r\nthe attention of the Manchester cotton manufacturers, and we have\r\nnow two very interesting works written by persons who went specially\r\nto the States in order to study the rapid progress made there in\r\nspinning and weaving.[200]\r\n\r\nThese two inquiries fully confirm what has been said in the text of\r\nthis book about the rapid progress made in the American industry\r\naltogether, and especially in the development of a very fine\r\ncotton-weaving machinery. In his preface to Mr. Young’s book, Mr.\r\nHelm says: “The results of this inquiry may not incorrectly be called\r\na revelation for Lancashire. It was, indeed, already known to a few\r\non this side of the ocean that there were wide differences between\r\nthe methods and organisation of American and English cotton-mills.\r\nBut it is only between the last three or four years that suspicion\r\nhas arisen amongst us that our competitors in the United States\r\nhave been marching faster than we have in the path of economy of\r\nproduction.”\r\n\r\nThe most important difference between the British and American\r\nmethods was, in Mr. Helm’s opinion, in “the extensive use of the\r\nautomatic loom.” Mr. Young’s investigation on the subject left no\r\ndoubts that the employment of this loom “substantially reduces the\r\ncost of production, and at the same time increases the earnings of\r\nthe weaver, because it permits him to conduct more looms” (p. 15).\r\nAltogether, we learn from Mr. Helm’s remarks that there are now\r\n85,000 automatic looms running in the United States, and that “the\r\ndemand for weavers is greater than ever” (p. 16). In a Rhode Island\r\nmill, 743 ordinary looms required 100 weavers, while 2,000 Northrop\r\n(or Draper) looms could be conducted by 134 weavers only, which means\r\nan average of fifteen looms for each weaver. At Burlington, Vermont,\r\nfrom sixteen to twenty Northrop looms were conducted by each weaver,\r\nand altogether these looms are spreading very rapidly. But it is not\r\nonly in the looms that such improvements have been introduced. “The\r\nspinning frames,” we are told by Mr. Young, “containing 112 spindles\r\na side, were tended by girls who ran four, six, eight, or ten sides\r\neach, according to the girl’s dexterity. The average for good\r\nspinners was about eight sides (896 spindles)” (p. 10).\r\n\r\nIn a New Bedford fine-spinning mill the ring-spinners were minding\r\n1,200 spindles each (p. 16).\r\n\r\nIt is also important to note the speed at which the cotton industry\r\nhas been developing lately in the States. The census of 1900 gave a\r\ntotal of 19,008,350 spindles. But in 1909 we find already 28,178,860\r\nspindles for cotton alone (34,500,000, including silk, wool, and\r\nworsted). And, what is still more important, most of this increase\r\nfell upon the Southern States, where machinery is also more perfect,\r\nboth for spinning and weaving, and where most of the work is being\r\ndone by the whites. In a South Carolina print-cloth mill, containing\r\n1,000 Draper looms, the average for narrow looms was 15½ looms to\r\neach weaver. (T. W. Uttley, _l.c._, pp. 4, 50, etc.)\r\n\r\nAs for the American competition in the Chinese markets, Mr. Helm\r\ngives imposing figures.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ.--MR. GIFFEN’S AND MR. FLUX’S FIGURES CONCERNING THE POSITION OF\r\nTHE UNITED KINGDOM IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE.\r\n\r\nA few remarks concerning these figures may be of some avail.\r\n\r\nWhen a sudden fall in the British and Irish exports took place in the\r\nyears 1882-1886, and the alarmists took advantage of the bad times to\r\nraise the never-forgotten war-cry of protection, especially insisting\r\non the damages made to British trade by “German competition,” Mr.\r\nGiffen analysed the figures of international trade in his “Finance\r\nEssays,” and in a report read in 1888 before the Board of Trade\r\nCommission. Subsequently, Mr. A. W. Flux analysed again the same\r\nfigures, extending them to a later period. He confirmed Mr. Giffen’s\r\nconclusions and endeavoured to prove that the famous “German\r\ncompetition” is a fallacy.\r\n\r\nMr. Giffen’s conclusions, quoted by Mr. A. W. Flux (“The Commercial\r\nSupremacy of Great Britain,” in _Economical Journal_, 1894, iv., p.\r\n457), were as follows:--\r\n\r\n“On the whole, the figures are not such as to indicate any great and\r\noverwhelming advance in German exports, in comparison with those of\r\nthe United Kingdom. There is greater progress in certain directions,\r\nbut, taken altogether, no great disproportionate advance, and in many\r\nimportant markets for the United Kingdom Germany hardly appears at\r\nall.”\r\n\r\nIn this subdued form, _with regard to German competition alone_--and\r\ndue allowance being made for figures in which no consideration is\r\ngiven to what sort of goods make a given value of exports, and in\r\nwhat quantities--Mr. Giffen’s statement could be accepted. But that\r\nwas all.\r\n\r\nIf we take, however, Mr. Giffen’s figures as they are reproduced in\r\nextended tables (on pp. 461-467 of the just quoted paper), tabulated\r\nwith great pains in order to show that Germany’s part in the imports\r\nto several European countries, such as Russia, Italy, Servia, etc.,\r\nhad declined, as well as the part of the United Kingdom, all we could\r\nconclude from these figures was, that there were other countries\r\nbesides Germany--namely, the United States and Belgium--which\r\ncompeted very effectively with England, France, and Germany for\r\nsupplying what manufactured goods were taken by Russia, Italy,\r\nServia, etc., from abroad.\r\n\r\nAt the same time such figures gave no idea of the fact that where\r\nmanufactured metal goods were formerly supplied, coal and raw metals\r\nwere imported for the home manufacture of those same goods; or, where\r\ndyed and printed cottons were imported, only yarn was required. The\r\nwhole subject is infinitely more complicated than it appeared in Mr.\r\nGiffen’s calculations; and, valuable as his figures may have been for\r\nappeasing exaggerated fears, they contained no answer whatever to the\r\nmany economic questions involved in the matters treated by Mr. Giffen.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions which I came to in these lines in the first edition\r\nof this book found further confirmation in the subsequent economical\r\ndevelopment of all nations in that same direction. The result is,\r\nthat--apart from the extraordinary exports of the years 1910 and 1911\r\n(which I venture to explain by the general prevision of a great\r\nEuropean war going to break out)--the exports from this country,\r\napart from their usual periodical fluctuations, continued to remain\r\nwhat they were, in proportion to the increasing population, and many\r\nof them became less profitable; while the exports from all other\r\ncountries increased in a much greater proportion.\r\n\r\n\r\nK.--MARKET-GARDENING IN BELGIUM.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 the superficies given to market gardening in Belgium was\r\n99,600 acres. In 1894 a Belgian professor of agriculture, who has\r\nkindly supplied me with notes on this subject, wrote:--\r\n\r\n“The area has considerably increased, and I believe it can be taken\r\nat 112,000 acres (45,000 hectares), if not more.” And further on:\r\n“Rents in the neighbourhood of the big towns, Antwerp, Liège, Ghent,\r\nand Brussels, attain as much as £5, 16s. and £8 per acre; the cost of\r\ninstalment is from £13 to £25 per acre; the yearly cost of manure,\r\nwhich is the chief expense, attains from £8 to £16 per acre the\r\nfirst year, and then from £5 to £8 every year.” The gardens are of\r\nthe average size of two and a half acres, and in each garden from\r\n200 to 400 frames are used. About the Belgian market-gardeners the\r\nsame remark must be made as has been made concerning the French\r\n_maraîchers_. They work awfully hard, having to pay extravagant\r\nrents, and to lay money aside, with the hope of some day being able\r\nto buy a piece of land, and to get rid of the blood-sucker who\r\nabsorbs so much of their money returns; having moreover every year\r\nto buy more and more frames in order to obtain their produce earlier\r\nand earlier, so as to fetch higher prices for it, they work like\r\nslaves. But it must be remembered that in order to obtain the same\r\namount of produce under glass, in greenhouses, the work of _three men\r\nonly_, working fifty-five hours a week, is required in Jersey for\r\ncultivating one acre of land under glass.\r\n\r\nBut I must refer my readers to the excellent work of my friend, B.\r\nSeebohm Rowntree’s _Land and Labour: Lessons from Belgium_, London\r\n(Macmillan), 1910, a strong volume of more than 600 pages, which\r\nis the result of several years of laborious studies. It is full\r\nof figures and personal observations, and will be consulted with\r\nadvantage for all the questions dealing with the economical life of\r\nBelgium.\r\n\r\n\r\nL.--THE CHANNEL ISLANDS--THE SCILLY ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nThe excellent state of agriculture in Jersey and Guernsey has\r\noften been mentioned in the agricultural and general literature of\r\nthis country, so I need only refer to the works of Mr. W. E. Bear\r\n(_Journal of the Agricultural Society_, 1888; _Quarterly Review_,\r\n1888; _British Farmer_, etc.) and to the exhaustive work of D. H.\r\nAnsted and R. G. Latham, _The Channel Islands_, third edition,\r\nrevised by E. Toulmin Nicolle, London (Allen), 1893.\r\n\r\nMany English writers--certainly not those just named--are inclined\r\nto explain the successes obtained in Jersey by the wonderful climate\r\nof the islands and the fertility of the soil. As to climate, it\r\nis certainly true that the yearly record of sunshine in Jersey is\r\ngreater than in any English station. It reaches from 1,842 hours a\r\nyear (1890) to 2,300 (1893), and thus exceeds the highest aggregate\r\nsunshine recorded in any English station by from 168 to 336 hours\r\n(exclusively high maximum in 1894) a year; May and August seeming\r\nto be the best favoured months.[201] But, to quote from the just\r\nmentioned work of Ansted and Latham:--\r\n\r\n“There is, doubtless, in all the islands, and especially in Guernsey,\r\n_an absence of sun heat_ and of the direct action of the sun’s rays\r\n_in summer_, which must have its effect, and _a remarkable prevalence\r\nof cold, dry, east wind in late spring, retarding vegetation_” (p.\r\n407). Everyone who has spent, be it only two or three weeks in late\r\nspring in Jersey, must know by experience how true this remark is.\r\nMoreover, there are the well-known Guernsey fogs, and “owing also to\r\nrain and damp the trees suffer from mildew and blight, as well as\r\nfrom various aphides.” The same authors remark that the nectarine\r\ndoes not succeed in Jersey in the open air “owing to the absence of\r\nautumn heat”; that “the wet autumns and cold summers do not agree\r\nwith the apricot;” and so on.\r\n\r\nIf Jersey potatoes are, on the average, three weeks in advance\r\nof those grown in Cornwall, the fact is fully explained by the\r\ncontinual improvements made in Jersey in view of obtaining, be\r\nit ever so small, quantities of potatoes a few days in advance,\r\neither by special care taken to plant them out as soon as possible,\r\nprotecting them from the cold winds, or by choosing tiny pieces of\r\nland naturally protected or better exposed. The difference in price\r\nbetween the earliest and the later potatoes being immense, the\r\ngreatest efforts are made to obtain an early crop.\r\n\r\nThe decline of prices per ton is best seen from the following prices\r\nin 1910:--\r\n\r\n                                Quantities           Prices.\r\n  Week ending                    exported.\r\n                                   Tons.              £   _s._  _d._\r\n\r\n  April 2-30                        210              30    11     0\r\n  May   7                           600              18    12     8\r\n   ”   14                         1,250              15    12     0\r\n   ”   21                         2,000              13     0     0\r\n   ”   28                         5,500              10     3     8\r\n  June  4                         7,825               8    13     4\r\n   ”   11                         9,200               6     5     8\r\n   ”   18                        13,000               4    17     6\r\n   ”   25                         9,650               4     8    10\r\n  July  2                         6,600               3    13     8\r\n   ”    9                         1,900               2    18     6\r\n   ”   16                           145               3     9     4\r\n   ”   23                            10               3    18     0\r\n                                 ------              --------------\r\n         Total                   57,890                    £381,373\r\n\r\nThe quantities of early potatoes exported varied during the years\r\n1901 to 1910 from 47,530 tons to 77,800 tons, and their value from\r\n£233,289 to £475,889.\r\n\r\nAs to the fertility of the soil, it is still worse advocacy, because\r\nthere is no area in the United Kingdom of equal size which would\r\nbe manured to such an extent as the area of Jersey and Guernsey is\r\nby means of artificial manure. In the seventeenth century, as may\r\nbe seen from the first edition of Falle’s _Jersey_, published in\r\n1694, the island “did not produce that quantity as is necessary for\r\nthe use of the inhabitants, who must be supplied from England in\r\ntime of peace, or from Dantzic in Poland.” In _The Groans of the\r\nInhabitants of Jersey_, published in London in 1709, we find the same\r\ncomplaint. And Quayle, who wrote in 1812 and quoted the two works\r\njust mentioned, in his turn complained in these terms: “The quantity\r\nat this day raised is quite inadequate to their sustenance, apart\r\nfrom the garrison.” (_General View of the Agriculture and the Present\r\nState of the Islands on the Coast of Normandy_, London, 1815, p.\r\n77.) And he added: “After making all allowance, the truth must be\r\ntold; the grain crops are here foul, in some instances execrably so.”\r\nAnd when we consult the modern writers, Ansted, Latham, and Nicolle,\r\nwe learn that the soil is by no means rich. It is decomposed granite,\r\nand easily cultivable, but “it contains no organic matter besides\r\nwhat man has put into it.”\r\n\r\nThis is certainly the opinion anyone will come to if he only visits\r\nthoroughly the island and looks attentively to its soil--to say\r\nnothing of the Quenvais where, in Quayle’s time, there was “an\r\nArabian desert” of sands and hillocks covering about seventy acres\r\n(p. 24), with a little better but still very poor soil in the north\r\nand west of it. The fertility of the soil has entirely been made,\r\nfirst, by the _vraic_ (sea-weeds), upon which the inhabitants have\r\nmaintained communal rights; later on, by considerable shipments of\r\nmanure, in addition to the manure of the very considerable living\r\nstock which is kept in the island; and finally, by an admirably good\r\ncultivation of the soil.\r\n\r\nMuch more than sunshine and good soil, it was the conditions of\r\nland-tenure and the low taxation which contributed to the remarkable\r\ndevelopment of agriculture in Jersey. First of all, the people of the\r\nIsles know but little of the tax-collector. While the English pay, in\r\ntaxes, an average of 50s. per head of population; while the French\r\npeasant is over-burdened with taxes of all imaginable descriptions;\r\nand the Milanese peasant has to give to the Treasury full 30 per\r\ncent. of his income--all taxes paid in the Channel Islands amount to\r\nbut 10s. per head in the town parishes and to much less than that\r\nin the country parishes. Besides, of indirect taxes, none are known\r\nbut the 2s. 6d. paid for each gallon of imported spirits and 9d. per\r\ngallon of imported wine.\r\n\r\nAs to the conditions of land-tenure, the inhabitants have happily\r\nescaped the action of Roman Law, and they continue to live under the\r\n_coutumier de Normandie_ (the old Norman common law). Accordingly,\r\nmore than one-half of the territory is owned by those who themselves\r\ntill the soil; there is no landlord to watch the crops and to raise\r\nthe rent before the farmer has ripened the fruit of his improvements;\r\nthere is nobody to charge so much for each cart-load of sea-weeds\r\nor sand taken to the fields; everyone takes the amount he likes,\r\nprovided he cuts the weeds at a certain season of the year, and\r\ndigs out the sand at a distance of sixty yards from the high-water\r\nmark. Those who buy land for cultivation can do so without becoming\r\nenslaved to the money-lender. One-fourth part only of the permanent\r\nrent which the purchaser undertakes to pay is capitalised and has\r\nto be paid down on purchase (often less than that), the remainder\r\nbeing a perpetual rent in wheat which is valued in Jersey at fifty\r\nto fifty-four _sous de France_ per cabot. To seize property for debt\r\nis accompanied with such difficulties that it is seldom resorted\r\nto (Quayle’s _General View_, pp. 41-46). Conveyances of land are\r\nsimply acknowledged by both parties on oath, and cost nearly nothing.\r\nAnd the laws of inheritance are such as to preserve the homestead,\r\nnotwithstanding the debts that the father may have run into (_ibid._,\r\npp. 35-41).\r\n\r\nAfter having shown how small are the farms in the islands (from\r\ntwenty to five acres, and very many less than that)--there being\r\n“less than 100 farms in either island that exceed twenty-five\r\nacres; and of these only about half a dozen in Jersey exceed fifty\r\nacres”--Messrs. Ansted, Latham, and Nicolle remark:--\r\n\r\n“In no place do we find so happy and so contented a country as in the\r\nChannel Islands....” “The system of land-tenure has also contributed\r\nin no small degree to their prosperity....” “The purchaser becomes\r\nthe absolute owner of the property, and his position cannot be\r\ntouched so long as the interest of these [wheat] rents be paid.\r\nHe cannot be compelled, as in the case of mortgage, to refund the\r\nprincipal. _The advantages of such a system are too patent to need\r\nany further allusion._” (_The Channel Islands_, third edition,\r\nrevised by E. Toulmin Nicolle, p. 401; see also p. 443.)\r\n\r\nThe following will better show how the cultivable area is utilised in\r\nJersey (_The Evening Post Royal Almanack_):--\r\n\r\n                                                  1894.  1911.\r\n                                                 Acres.

Out of it the following\r\nmay be taken as a perfectly reliable illustration, in addition to\r\nthose given in the text:--\r\n\r\nMr. B.’s greenhouse has a length of 300 feet and a width of 18 feet,\r\nwhich makes 5,400 square feet, out of which 900 square feet are under\r\nthe passage in the middle. The cultivable area is thus 4,500 square\r\nfeet. There are no brick walls, but brick pillars and boards are used\r\nfor front walls. Hot-water heating is provided, but is only used\r\noccasionally, to keep off the frosts in winter--the crops being early\r\npotatoes (which require no heating), followed by tomatoes. The latter\r\nare Mr. B.’s speciality. Catch crops of radishes, etc., are taken.\r\nThe cost of the greenhouse, without the heating apparatus, is 10s.\r\nper running foot of greenhouse, which makes £150 for one-eighth of an\r\nacre under glass, or a little less than 7d. per glass-roofed square\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nThe crops are: potatoes, four cabots per perch--that is,\r\nthree-quarters of a ton of early potatoes from the greenhouse; and\r\ntomatoes, in the culture of which Mr. B. attains extraordinary\r\nresults. He puts in only 1,000 plants, thus giving to his plants more\r\nroom than is usually given; and he cultivates a corrugated variety\r\nwhich gives very heavy crops but does not fetch the same prices as\r\nthe smooth varieties. In 1896 his crop was four tons of tomatoes, and\r\nso it would have been in 1897--each plant giving an average of twenty\r\npounds of fruit, while the usual crop is from eight to twelve pounds\r\nper plant.\r\n\r\nThe total crop was thus four and three-quarter tons of vegetables,\r\nto which the catch crops must be added--thus corresponding to 85,000\r\nlb. per acre (over 90,000 lb. with the catch crops). I again omit the\r\nmoney returns, and only mention that the expenditure for fuel and\r\nmanure was about £10 a year, and that the Jersey average is three\r\nmen, each working fifty-five hours a week (ten hours a day), for\r\nevery acre under glass.\r\n\r\n_The Scilly Islands._--These islands also give a beautiful\r\nillustration of what may be obtained from the soil by an intensive\r\ncultivation. When shipping and supplying pilots became a decaying\r\nsource of income, the Scillonians took to the growing of potatoes.\r\nFor many years, we are told by Mr. J. G. Uren (_Scilly and the\r\nScillonians_, Plymouth, 1907), this was a very profitable industry.\r\nThe crop was ready at least a month in advance of any other source\r\nof supply on the mainland. Every year about 1,000 tons of potatoes\r\nwere exported. “In its palmy days the potato harvest in Scilly was\r\nthe great event of the year. Gangs of diggers were brought across\r\nfrom the mainland,” and the prices went occasionally up to £28 a ton\r\nfor the earliest potatoes. Gradually, however, the export of potatoes\r\nwas reduced to less than one-half of what it was formerly. Then\r\nthe inhabitants of the islands went for fishing, and later on they\r\nbegan to grow flowers. Frost and snow being practically unknown in\r\nthe islands, this new industry succeeded very well. The arable area\r\nof the islands is about 4,000 acres, which are divided into small\r\nfarms, less than from fifteen to twenty acres, and these farms are\r\ntransmitted, according to the local custom, from father to son.\r\n\r\nIt is not long ago that they began to grow wild narcissuses, to\r\nwhich they soon added daffodils (a hundred varieties), and lilies,\r\nespecially arum-lilies, for Church decoration. All these are grown\r\nin narrow strips, sheltered from the winds by dwarf hedges. Movable\r\nglass-houses are resorted to shelter the flowers for a certain time,\r\nand in this way the gardeners have a succession of crops, beginning\r\nsoon after Christmas, and lasting until April or May.\r\n\r\nThe flowers are shipped to Penzance, and thence carried by rail in\r\nspecial carriages. At the top of the season thirty to forty tons are\r\nshipped in a single day. The total exports, which were only 100 tons\r\nin 1887, have now reached 1,000 in 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\nM.--IRRIGATED MEADOWS IN ITALY.\r\n\r\nIn the _Journal de l’Agriculture_ (2nd Feb., 1889) the following was\r\nsaid about the _marcites_ of Milan:--\r\n\r\n“On part of these meadows water runs constantly, on others it is\r\nleft running for ten hours every week. The former give six crops\r\nevery year; since February, eighty to 100 tons of grass, equivalent\r\nto twenty and twenty-five tons of dry hay, being obtained from the\r\nhectare (eight to ten tons per acre). Lower down, thirteen tons of\r\ndry hay per acre is the regular crop. Taking eighty acres placed in\r\naverage conditions, they will yield fifty-six tons of green grass\r\nper hectare--that is, fourteen tons of dry hay, or the food of three\r\nmilch cows to the hectare (two and a half acres). The rent of such\r\nmeadows is from £8 to £9, 12s. per acre.”\r\n\r\nFor Indian corn, the advantages of irrigation are equally apparent.\r\nOn irrigated lands, crops of from seventy-eight to eighty-nine\r\nbushels per acre are obtained, as against from fifty-six to\r\nsixty-seven bushels on unirrigated lands, also in Italy, and\r\ntwenty-eight to thirty-three bushels in France (Garola, _Les\r\nCéréales_).\r\n\r\n\r\nN.--PLANTED WHEAT.\r\n\r\n_The Rothamsted Challenge._\r\n\r\nSir A. Cotton delivered, in 1893, before the Balloon Society, a\r\nlecture on agriculture, in which lecture he warmly advocated deep\r\ncultivation and planting the seeds of wheat wide apart. He published\r\nit later on as a pamphlet (_Lecture on Agriculture_, 2nd edition,\r\nwith Appendix. Dorking, 1893). He obtained, for the best of his\r\nsort of wheat, an average of “fifty-five ears per plant, with three\r\noz. of grain of fair quality--perhaps sixty-three lbs. per bushel”\r\n(p. 10). This corresponded to ninety bushels per acre--that is,\r\nhis result was very similar to those obtained at the Tomblaine and\r\nCapelle agricultural stations by Grandeau and F. Dessprèz, whose work\r\nseems not to have been known to Sir A. Cotton. True, Sir A. Cotton’s\r\nexperiments were not conducted, or rather were not reported, in a\r\nthoroughly scientific way. But the more desirable it would have been,\r\neither to contradict or to confirm his statements by experiments\r\ncarefully conducted at some experimental agricultural station.\r\nUnfortunately, so far as I know, no such experiments have yet been\r\nmade, and the possibility of profitably increasing the wheat crop\r\nby the means indicated by Sir A. Cotton has still to be tested in a\r\nscientific spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\nO.--REPLANTED WHEAT.\r\n\r\nA few words on this method which now claims the attention of the\r\nexperimental stations may perhaps not be useless.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, rice is always treated in this way. It is treated as our\r\ngardeners treat lettuce and cabbage--that is, it is let first to\r\ngerminate; then it is sown in special warm corners, well inundated\r\nwith water and protected from the birds by strings drawn over the\r\nground. Thirty-five to fifty-five days later, the young plants, now\r\nfully developed and possessed of a thick network of rootlets, are\r\n_replanted_ in the open ground. In this way the Japanese obtain from\r\ntwenty to thirty-two bushels of _dressed_ rice to the acre in the\r\npoor provinces, forty bushels in the better ones, and from sixty\r\nto sixty-seven bushels on the best lands. The average, in six rice\r\ngrowing states of North America, is at the same time only nine and a\r\nhalf bushels.[202]\r\n\r\nIn China, replanting is also in general use, and consequently the\r\nidea has been circulated in France by M. Eugène Simon and the late\r\nM. Toubeau, that replanted wheat could be made a powerful means of\r\nincreasing the crops in Western Europe.[203] So far as I know, the\r\nidea has not yet been submitted to a practical test; but when one\r\nthinks of the remarkable results obtained by Hallet’s method of\r\nplanting; of what the market-gardeners obtain by replanting once\r\nand even twice; and of how rapidly the work of planting is done by\r\nmarket-gardeners in Jersey, one must agree that in replanted wheat\r\nwe have a new opening worthy of the most careful consideration.\r\nExperiments have not yet been made in this direction; but Prof.\r\nGrandeau, whose opinion I have asked on this subject, wrote to me\r\nthat he believes the method must have a great future. Practical\r\nmarket-gardeners (Paris _maraîcher_) whose opinion I have asked, see,\r\nof course, nothing extravagant in that idea.\r\n\r\nWith plants yielding 1,000 grains each--and in the Capelle experiment\r\nthey yielded an average of 600 grains--the yearly wheat-food of one\r\nindividual man (5·65 bushels, or 265 lbs.), which is represented by\r\nfrom 5,000,000 to 5,500,000 grains, could be grown on a space of\r\n250 square yards; while for an experienced hand replanting would\r\nrepresent no more than ten to twelve hours’ work. With a proper\r\nmachine-tool, the work could probably be very much reduced. In Japan,\r\ntwo men and two women plant with rice three-quarters of an acre in\r\none day (Ronna, _Les Irrigations_, vol. iii., 1890, p. 67 seq.). That\r\nmeans (Fesca, _Japanesische Landwirthschaft_, p. 33) from 33,000 to\r\n66,000 plants, or, let us say, a minimum of 8,250 plants a day for\r\none person. The Jersey gardeners plant from 600 (inexperienced) to\r\n1,000 plants per hour (experienced).\r\n\r\n\r\nP.--IMPORTS OF VEGETABLES TO THE UNITED KINGDOM.\r\n\r\nThat the land in this country is not sufficiently utilised for\r\nmarket-gardening, and that the largest portion of the vegetables\r\nwhich are imported from abroad could be grown in this country, has\r\nbeen said over and over again within the last twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that considerable improvements have taken place\r\nlately--the area under market-gardens, and especially the area\r\nunder glass for the growth of fruit and vegetables, having largely\r\nbeen increased of late. Thus, instead of 38,957 acres, which were\r\ngiven to market-gardening in Great Britain in 1875, there were, in\r\n1894, 88,210 acres, exclusive of vegetable crops on farms, given\r\nto that purpose (_The Gardener’s Chronicle_, 20th April, 1895, p.\r\n483). But that increase remains a trifle in comparison with similar\r\nincreases in France, Belgium, and the United States. In France, the\r\narea given to market-gardening was estimated in 1892 by M. Baltet\r\n(_L’horticulture dans les cinq parties du monde_, Paris, Hachette,\r\n1895) at 1,075,000 acres--four times more, in proportion to the\r\ncultivable area, than in this country; and the most remarkable of it\r\nis that considerable tracts of land formerly treated as uncultivable\r\nhave been reclaimed for the purposes of market-gardening as also of\r\nfruit growing.\r\n\r\nAs things stand now in this country, we see that very large\r\nquantities of the commonest vegetables, each of which could be grown\r\nin this country, are imported.\r\n\r\nLettuces are imported--not only from the Azores or from the south\r\nof France, but they continue until June to be imported from France,\r\nwhere they are mostly grown--not in the open air, but in frames.\r\nEarly cucumbers, also grown in frames, are largely imported from\r\nHolland, and are sold so cheaply that many English gardeners have\r\nceased to grow them.[204] Even beetroot and pickling cabbage are\r\nimported from Holland and Brittany (the neighbourhoods of Saint Malo,\r\nwhere I saw them grown in a sandy soil, which would grow nothing\r\nwithout a heavy manuring with guano, as a second crop, after a first\r\none of potatoes); and while onions were formerly largely grown in\r\nthis country, we see that, in 1894, 5,288,512 bushels of onions,\r\n£765,049 worth, were imported from Belgium (chief exporter), Germany,\r\nHolland, France, and so on.\r\n\r\nAgain, that early potatoes should be imported from the Azores and\r\nthe south of France is quite natural. It is not so natural, however,\r\nthat more than 50,000 tons of potatoes (58,060 tons, £521,141 worth,\r\non the average during the years 1891-1894) should be imported from\r\nthe Channel Islands, because there are hundreds if not thousands\r\nof acres in South Devon, and most probably in other parts of the\r\nsouth coast too, where early potatoes could be grown equally well.\r\nBut besides the 90,000 tons of early potatoes (over £700,000 worth)\r\nwhich are imported to this country, enormous quantities of late\r\npotatoes are imported from Holland, Germany, and Belgium; so that the\r\ntotal imports of potatoes reach from 200,000 to 450,000 tons every\r\nyear. Moreover, this country imports every year all sorts of green\r\nvegetables, for the sum of at least £4,000,000, and for £5,000,000\r\nall sorts of fruit (apart from exotic fruit); while thousands of\r\nacres lie idle, and the country population is driven to the cities in\r\nsearch of work, without finding it.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.--FRUIT-CULTURE IN BELGIUM.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the _Annuaire statistique de la belgique_ that, out\r\nof a cultivated area of 6,443,500 acres, the following areas were\r\ngiven in Belgium, at the time of the last census, to fruit-growing,\r\nmarket-gardening, and culture under glass: Orchards, 117,600 acres;\r\nmarket-gardens, 103,460 acres; vineries, 173 acres (increased since);\r\ngrowing of trees for afforestation, gardens, and orchards, 7,475\r\nacres; potatoes, 456,000 acres. Consequently, Belgium is able to\r\nexport every year about £250,000 worth more vegetables, and nearly\r\n£500,000 worth more fruit, than she imports. As to the vineries, the\r\nland of the communes of Hoeylart and Overyssche near Brussels is\r\nalmost entirely covered with glass, and the exports of home-grown\r\ngrapes attained, in 1910, 6,800 tons, in addition to 34,000 tons of\r\nother home-grown fruit. Besides, nearly 3,000 acres in the environs\r\nof Ghent are covered with horticultural establishments which export\r\npalms, azaleas, rhododendrons, and laurels all over the world,\r\nincluding Italy and the Argentine.\r\n\r\n\r\nR.--CULTURE UNDER GLASS IN HOLLAND.\r\n\r\nHolland in its turn has introduced gardening in hothouses on a great\r\nscale. Here is a letter which I received in the summer of 1909 from a\r\nfriend:--\r\n\r\n“Here is a picture-postcard which J. (a professor of botany in\r\nBelgium) has brought from Holland, and which he asks me to send you.\r\n[The postcard represents an immense space covered with frames and\r\nglass lights.] Similar establishments cover many square kilomètres\r\nbetween Rotterdam and the sea, in the north of Heuve. At the time\r\nwhen J. was there (June 10) they had cucumbers, quite ripe, and\r\nmelons as big as a head in considerable numbers, exported abroad. The\r\ncultures are made to a great extent without heating. The gardeners\r\nsow also radishes, carrots, lettuce, under the same glass. The\r\ndifferent produce comes one after the other. They also cultivate\r\nlarge quantities of strawberries in frames.\r\n\r\n“The glass-frames are transported at will, so as to keep under glass\r\nfor several days or weeks the plants sown in any part of the garden.\r\nJ. is full of admiration for the knowledge of the gardeners. Instead\r\nof the usual routine, they apply the last progress of science. He was\r\ntold that glass is broken very seldom; they have acquired the art of\r\nhandling glass-frames with facility and great skill.\r\n\r\n“Besides the frames represented on the photograph, the region between\r\nRotterdam and the sea, which is named Westland, has also countless\r\nglass-houses, where they cultivate, with or without heating, grapes,\r\npeaches, northern cherries, haricot beans, tomatoes, and other fruit\r\nand vegetables. These cultures have reached a very high degree of\r\nperfection. The gardeners take the greatest care to fight various\r\nplant diseases. They also cultivate ordinary fruit--apples, pears,\r\ngooseberries, strawberries, and so on--and vegetables in the open\r\nair. Westland being very much exposed to strong winds, they have\r\nbuilt numerous walls, which break the wind, and serve at the same\r\ntime for the culture of fruit upon the walls.\r\n\r\n“All the region feels the favourable influence of the agricultural\r\nschool of Naaldwijk, which is situated almost in the centre of the\r\nWestland.”\r\n\r\n\r\nS.--PRICES OBTAINED IN LONDON FOR DESSERT GRAPES CULTIVATED UNDER\r\nGLASS.\r\n\r\n_The Fruit and Market-Gardener_ gives every week the prices realised\r\nby horticultural and intensive gardening produce, as well as by\r\nflowers, at the great market of Covent Garden. The prices obtained\r\nfor dessert grapes--Colmar and Hamburg--are very instructive. I took\r\ntwo years--1907-1908--which differ from ordinary years by the winters\r\nhaving been foggy, which made the garden produce to be somewhat late.\r\n\r\nIn the first days of January the Colmar grapes arriving from the\r\nBelgian hothouses were still sold at relatively low prices--from\r\n6d. to 10d. the pound. But the prices slowly rose in January and\r\nFebruary; the Hamburg grapes were late that year, and therefore in\r\nthe middle of March and later on in April the Colmars fetched from\r\n1s. 6d. to 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\nThe English grapes, coming from Worthing and so on, are certainly\r\npreferred to those that come from Belgium or the Channel Islands. By\r\nthe end of April, 1907, and at the beginning of May, they were even\r\nsold at 2s. and 4s. the pound. The best and largest grapes for the\r\ndinners are evidently fetching fancy prices.\r\n\r\nBut at last the Hamburg grapes, which were late in 1907 and 1908,\r\nbegan to arrive from Belgium, the Channel Islands, and England, and\r\nthe prices suddenly fell. By the end of May the Belgian Hamburgs\r\nfetched only from 10d. to 1s. 4d. the pound, and the prices were\r\nstill falling. In June and July the gardeners could only get from 5d.\r\nto 7d., and during the months of September, October, and November,\r\n1908, the best Guernsey grapes were quoted at 6d. the pound. Very\r\nbeautiful ones fetched only 4d. the pound.\r\n\r\nIt was only in the first days of November that the prices went up to\r\n10d. and 1s. 1d. But already, in the second half of December, the new\r\ncrop of Colmars began to pour in from Belgium, and the prices fell to\r\n9d., and even to 6d. per pound about Christmas.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that, notwithstanding a great demand for the best\r\nhothouse grapes, with big grains and quite fresh cut, these grapes\r\nare sold in the autumn almost at the same prices as grapes grown\r\nunder the beautiful sun of the south.\r\n\r\nAs to the quantities of grapes imported to this country, the figures\r\nare also most instructive. The average for the three years 1905-1907\r\nwas 81,700,000 lbs., representing a value of £2,224,500.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.--THE USE OF ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nIn the first editions of this book I did not venture to speak about\r\nthe improvements that could be obtained in agriculture with the aid\r\nof electricity, or by watering the soil with cultures of certain\r\nuseful microbes. I preferred to mention only well-established facts\r\nof intensive culture; but now it would be impossible not to mention\r\nwhat has been done in these two directions.\r\n\r\nMore than thirty years ago I mentioned in _Nature_ the increase of\r\nthe crops obtained by a Russian landlord who used to place at a\r\ncertain height above his experimental field telegraph wires, through\r\nwhich an electric current was passed. A few years ago, in 1908, Sir\r\nOliver Lodge gave in the _Daily Chronicle_ of July 15 the results of\r\nsimilar experiments made in a farm near Evesham by Messrs. Newman and\r\nBomford, with the aid of Sir Oliver Lodge’s son, Mr. Lionel Lodge.\r\n\r\nA series of thin wires was placed above an experimental field at\r\ndistances of ten yards from each other. These wires were attached\r\nto telegraph poles, high enough not to stand in the way of the\r\ncarts loaded with corn. Another field was cultivated by the side of\r\nthe former, in order to ascertain what would be the crops obtained\r\nwithout the aid of electricity.\r\n\r\nThe poles, five yards high, were placed far away from each other, so\r\nthat the wires were quite loose. Owing to the high tension of the\r\ncurrents that had to be passed through the wires, the insulators on\r\nthe poles were very powerful. The currents were positive and of a\r\nhigh potential--about 100,000 volts. The escape of electricity under\r\nthese conditions was so great that it could be seen in the dark. One\r\ncould also feel it on the hair and the face while passing under the\r\nwires.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the expenditure of electric force was small, Sir Oliver\r\nLodge writes; because, if the potential was high, the quantity\r\nof consumed energy was, notwithstanding that, very small. It is\r\nknown, indeed, that this is also the case with the discharges of\r\natmospheric electricity, which are terrible in consequence of their\r\nhigh tension, but do not represent a great loss of energy. An oil\r\nmotor of two horse-power was therefore quite sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe results were very satisfactory. The wheat crop in the electrified\r\nfield was, in the years 1906-1907, by 29 to 40 per cent. greater, and\r\nalso of better quality, than in the non-electrified field. The straw\r\nwas also from four to eight inches longer.\r\n\r\nFor strawberries the increase of the crop was 35 per cent., and 25\r\nper cent. for beetroot.\r\n\r\nAs to the inoculation of useful microbes by means of watering the\r\nsoil with cultures of nitrifying bacteria, experiments on a great\r\nscale have been made in Prussia upon some peat-bogs. The German\r\nagricultural papers speak of these experiments as having given most\r\nsatisfactory results.\r\n\r\nMost interesting results have also been obtained in Germany by\r\nheating the soil with a mixture of air and hot steam passed along the\r\nordinary draining tubes. A society has been formed to propagate this\r\nsystem, and the photographs of the results published by the Society\r\nin a pamphlet, _Gartenkultur, Bodenheizung, Klimaverbesserung_\r\n(Berlin, 1906), seem to prove that with a soil thus heated the growth\r\nof certain vegetables is accelerated to some extent.\r\n\r\n\r\nU.--PETTY TRADES IN THE LYONS REGION.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhoods of St. Etienne are a great centre for all sorts of\r\nindustries, and among them the petty trades occupy still an important\r\nplace. Ironworks and coal-mines with their smoking chimneys, noisy\r\nfactories, roads blackened with coal, and a poor vegetation give\r\nthe country the well-known aspects of a “Black Country.” In certain\r\ntowns, such as St. Chamond, one finds numbers of big factories\r\nin which thousands of women are employed in the fabrication of\r\n_passementerie_. But side by side with the great industry the petty\r\ntrades also maintain a high development. Thus we have first the\r\nfabrication of silk ribbons, in which no less than 50,000 men and\r\nwomen were employed in the year 1885. Only 3,000 or 4,000 looms were\r\nlocated then in the factories; while the remainder--that is, from\r\n1,200 to 1,400 looms--belonged to the workers themselves, both at St.\r\nEtienne and in the surrounding country.[205] As a rule the women and\r\nthe girls spin the silk or make the winding off, while the father\r\nwith his sons weave the ribbons. I saw these small workshops in the\r\nsuburbs of St. Etienne, where complicated ribbons (with interwoven\r\naddresses of the manufacture), as well as ribbons of high artistic\r\nfinish, were woven in three to four looms, while in the next room the\r\nwife prepared the dinner and attended to household work.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when the wages were high in the ribbon trade\r\n(reaching over ten francs a day), and M. Euvert wrote me that\r\nhalf of the suburban houses of St. Etienne had been built by the\r\n_passementiers_ themselves. But the affairs took a very gloomy aspect\r\nwhen a crisis broke out in 1884. No orders were forthcoming, and the\r\nribbon weavers had to live on casual earnings. All their economies\r\nwere soon spent. “How many,” M. Euvert wrote, “have been compelled\r\nto sell for a few hundred francs the loom for which they had paid\r\nas many thousand francs.” What an effect this crisis has had on the\r\ntrade I could not say, as I have no recent information about this\r\nregion. Very probably a great number of the ribbon weavers have\r\nemigrated to St. Etienne, where artistic weaving is continued, while\r\nthe cheapest sorts of ribbon must be made in factories.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of arms occupies from 5,000 to 6,000 workers, half\r\nof whom are in St. Etienne, and the remainder in the neighbouring\r\ncounty. All work is done in small workshops, save in the great arm\r\nfactory of the State, which sometimes will employ from 10,000 to\r\n15,000 persons, and sometimes only a couple of thousand men.\r\n\r\nAnother important trade in the same region is the manufacture of\r\nhardware, which is all made in small workshops, in the neighbourhoods\r\nof St. Etienne, Le Chambon, Firminy, Rive de Giers, and St. Bonnet le\r\nChâteau. The work is pretty regular, but the earnings are low as a\r\nrule. And yet the peasants continue to keep to those trades, as they\r\ncannot go on without some industrial occupation during part of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe yearly production of silk stuffs in France attained no less\r\nthan 7,558,000 kilogrammes in 1881;[206] and most of the 5,000,000\r\nto 6,000,000 kilogrammes of raw silk which were manufactured in\r\nthe Lyons region were manufactured by hand.[207] Twenty years\r\nbefore--that is, about 1865--there were only from 6,000 to 8,000\r\npower-looms, and when we take into account both the prosperous\r\nperiod of the Lyons silk industry about 1876, and the crisis which\r\nit underwent in 1880-1886, we cannot but wonder about the slowness\r\nof the transformation of the industry. Such is also the opinion of\r\nthe President of the Lyons Chamber of Commerce, who wrote me that the\r\ndomain of the power-loom is increased every year, “by including new\r\nkinds of stuffs, which formerly were reputed as unfeasible in the\r\npower-looms; but,” he added, “the transformation of small workshops\r\ninto factories still goes on so slowly that the total number of\r\npower-looms reaches only from 20,000 to 25,000 out of an aggregate\r\nof from 100,000 to 110,000.” (Since that time it certainly must have\r\nconsiderably increased.)\r\n\r\nThe leading features of the Lyons silk industry are the following:--\r\n\r\nThe preparatory work--winding off, warping and so on--is mostly made\r\nin small workshops, chiefly at Lyons, with only a few workshops of\r\nthe kind in the villages. Dyeing and finishing are also made--of\r\ncourse, in great factories--and it is especially in dyeing, which\r\noccupies 4,000 to 5,000 hands, that the Lyons manufacturers have\r\nattained their highest repute. Not only silks are dyed there, but\r\nalso cottons and wools, and not only for France, but also to some\r\nextent for London, Manchester, Vienna, and even Moscow. It is also\r\nin this branch that the best machines have to be mentioned.[208]\r\n\r\nAs to the weaving, it is made, as we just saw, on from 20,000 to\r\n25,000 power-looms and from 75,000 to 90,000 hand-looms, which partly\r\nare at Lyons (from 15,000 to 18,000 hand-looms in 1885) and chiefly\r\nin the villages. The workshops, where one might formerly find several\r\n_compagnons_ employed by one master, have a tendency to disappear,\r\nthe workshops mostly having now but from two to three hand-looms, on\r\nwhich the father, the mother, and the children are working together.\r\nIn each house, in each storey of the Croix Rousse, you find until now\r\nsuch small workshops. The _fabricant_ gives the general indications\r\nas to the kind of stuff he desires to be woven, and his draughtsmen\r\ndesign the pattern, but it is the workman himself who must find\r\nthe way to weave in threads of all colours the patterns sketched\r\non paper. He thus continually creates something new; and many\r\nimprovements and discoveries have been made by workers whose very\r\nnames remain unknown.[209]\r\n\r\nThe Lyons weavers have retained until now the character of being\r\nthe _élite_ of their trade in higher artistic work in silk stuffs.\r\nThe finest, really artistic brocades, satins and velvets, are woven\r\nin the smallest workshops, where one or two looms only are kept.\r\nUnhappily the unsettled character of the demand for such a high style\r\nof work is often a cause of misery amongst them. In former times,\r\nwhen the orders for higher sorts of silks became scarce, the Lyons\r\nweavers resorted to the manufacture of stuffs of lower qualities:\r\n_foulards_, _crêpes_, _tulles_, of which Lyons had the monopoly in\r\nEurope. But now the commoner kinds of goods are manufactured by\r\nthe million, on the one side by the factories of Lyons, Saxony,\r\nRussia, and Great Britain, and on the other side by peasants in the\r\nneighbouring departments of France, as well as in the Swiss villages\r\nof the cantons of Basel and Zurich, and in the villages of the Rhine\r\nprovinces, Italy, and Russia.\r\n\r\nThe emigration of the French silk industry from the towns to the\r\nvillages began long ago--that is, about 1817--but it was especially\r\nin the ’sixties that this movement took a great development. About\r\nthe year 1872 nearly 90,000 hand-looms were scattered, not only\r\nin the Rhône department, but also in those of Ain, Isère, Loire,\r\nSaône-et-Loire, and even those of Drôme, Ardèche, and Savoie.\r\nSometimes the looms were supplied by the merchants, but most of them\r\nwere bought by the weavers themselves, and it was especially women\r\nand girls who worked on them at the hours free from agriculture. But\r\nalready since 1835 the emigration of the silk industry from the city\r\nto the villages began in the shape of great factories erected in\r\nthe villages, and such factories continue to spread in the country,\r\nmaking terrible havoc amidst the rural populations.\r\n\r\nWhen a new factory is built in a village it attracts at once the\r\ngirls, and partly also the boys of the neighbouring peasantry. The\r\ngirls and boys are always happy to find an independent livelihood\r\nwhich emancipates them from the control of the family. Consequently,\r\nthe wages of the factory girls are extremely low. At the same time\r\nthe distance from the village to the factory being mostly great, the\r\ngirls cannot return home every day, the less so as the hours of\r\nlabour are usually long. So they stay all the week at the factory,\r\nin barracks, and they only return home on Saturday evening; while at\r\nsunrise on Monday a waggon makes the tour of the villages, and brings\r\nthem back to the factory. Barrack life--not to mention its moral\r\nconsequences--soon renders the girls quite unable to work in the\r\nfields. And, when they are grown up, they discover that they cannot\r\nmaintain themselves at the low wages offered by the factory; but they\r\ncan no more return to peasant life. It is easy to see what havoc the\r\nfactory is thus doing in the villages, and how unsettled is its very\r\nexistence, based upon the very low wages offered to country girls.\r\nIt destroys the peasant home, it renders the life of the town worker\r\nstill more precarious on account of the competition it makes to him;\r\nand the trade itself is in a perpetual state of unsettledness.\r\n\r\nSome information about the present state of the small industries in\r\nthis region will be found in the text; but, unfortunately, we have no\r\nmodern description of the industrial life of the Lyons region, which\r\nwe might compare with the above.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--SMALL INDUSTRIES AT PARIS.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to enumerate here all the varieties of\r\nsmall industries which are carried on at Paris; nor would such an\r\nenumeration be complete, because every year new industries are\r\nbrought into life. I therefore will mention only a few of the most\r\nimportant industries.\r\n\r\nA great number of them are connected, of course, with ladies’\r\ndress. The _confections_--that is, the making of various parts of\r\nladies’ dress--occupy no less than 22,000 operatives at Paris, and\r\ntheir production attains £3,000,000 every year, while gowns give\r\noccupation to 15,000 women, whose annual production is valued at\r\n£2,400,000. Linen, shoes, gloves, and so on, are as many important\r\nbranches of the petty trades and the Paris domestic industries, while\r\none-fourth part of the stays which are sewn in France (£500,000 out\r\nof £2,000,000) are made in Paris.\r\n\r\nEngraving, book-binding, and all kinds of fancy stationery, as well\r\nas the manufacture of musical and mathematical instruments, are again\r\nas many branches in which the Paris workmen excel. Basket-making is\r\nanother very important item, the finest sorts only being made in\r\nParis, while the plainest sorts are made in the centres mentioned in\r\nthe text (Haute Marne, Aisne, etc.). Brushes are also made in small\r\nworkshops, the trade being valued at £800,000 both at Paris and in\r\nthe neighbouring department of Oise.\r\n\r\nFor furniture, there are at Paris as many as 4,340 workshops, in\r\nwhich three or four operatives per workshop are employed on the\r\naverage. In the watch trade we find 2,000 workshops with only\r\n6,000 operatives, and their production, about £1,000,000, reaches\r\nnevertheless nearly one-third part of the total watch production in\r\nFrance. The _maroquinerie_ gives the very high figure of £500,000,\r\nalthough it employs only 1,000 persons, scattered in 280 workshops,\r\nthis high figure itself testifying to the high artistic value of\r\nthe Paris leather fancy goods. The jewelry, both for articles of\r\nluxury, and for all descriptions of cheap goods, is again one of\r\nthe specialities of the Paris petty trades; and another well-known\r\nspeciality is the fabrication of artificial flowers. Finally, we must\r\nmention the carriage and saddlery trades, which are carried on in\r\nthe small towns round Paris; the making of fine straw hats; glass\r\ncutting, and painting on glass and china; and numerous workshops for\r\nfancy buttons, attire in mother-of-pearl, and small goods in horn and\r\nbone.\r\n\r\n\r\nW.--RESULTS OF THE CENSUS OF THE FRENCH INDUSTRIES IN 1896.\r\n\r\nIf we consult the results of the census of 1896, that were\r\npublished in 1901, in the fourth volume of _Résultats statistiques\r\ndu recensement des industries et des professions_, preceded by an\r\nexcellent summary written by M. Lucien March, we find that the\r\ngeneral impression about the importance of the small industries in\r\nFrance conveyed in the text is fully confirmed by the numerical data\r\nof the census.\r\n\r\nIt is only since 1896, M. March says in a paper read before the\r\nStatistical Society of Paris, that a detailed classification of the\r\nworkshops and factories according to the number of their operatives\r\nbecame possible;[210] and he gives us in this paper, in a series of\r\nvery elaborate tables, a most instructive picture of the present\r\nstate of industry in France.\r\n\r\nFor the industries proper--including the industries carried on by the\r\nState and the Municipalities, but excluding the transport trades--the\r\nresults of the census can be summed up as follows:--\r\n\r\nThere is, first of all, an important division of “heads of\r\nestablishments (_patrons_) working alone, independent artisans,\r\nand working-men without a permanent employment,” which contains\r\n1,530,000 persons. It has a very mixed character, as we find\r\nhere, in agriculture, the small farmer, who works for himself; and\r\nthe labourer, who works by the day for occasional farmers; and\r\nin industry the head of a small workshop, who works for himself\r\n(_patron-ouvrier_); the working-man, who on the day of the census\r\nhad no regular employment; the dressmaker, who works sometimes in\r\nher own room and sometimes in a shop; and so on. It is only in an\r\nindirect way that M. March finds out that this division contains, in\r\nits industrial part, nearly 483,000 artisans (_patrons-ouvriers_);\r\nand independent working-men and women; and about 1,047,000 persons of\r\nboth sexes, temporarily attached to some industrial establishment.\r\n\r\nThere are, next, 37,705 industrial establishments, of which the heads\r\nemploy no hired workmen, but are aided by one or more members of\r\ntheir own families.\r\n\r\nWe have thus, at least, 520,000 workshops belonging to the very small\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nNext to them come 575,530 workshops and factories, giving occupation\r\nto more than 3,000,000 persons. They constitute the bulk of French\r\nindustry, and their subdivision into small, middle-sized, and great\r\nindustry is what interests us at this moment.\r\n\r\nThe most striking point is the immense number of establishments\r\nhaving only from one to ten working-men each. No less than 539,449\r\nsuch workshops and factories have been tabulated, which makes 94 per\r\ncent. of all the industrial establishments in France; and we find in\r\nthem more than one-third of all workpeople of both sexes engaged in\r\nindustry--namely, 1,134,700 persons.\r\n\r\nNext comes the class, still very numerous (28,626 establishments\r\nand 585,000 operatives), where we find only from eleven to fifty\r\nworkmen per establishment. Nearly two-thirds of these small factories\r\n(17,342 establishments, 240,000 workmen) are so small that they give\r\noccupation to less than twenty persons each. They thus belong still\r\nto the small industry.\r\n\r\nAfter that comes a sudden fall in the figures. There are only 3,865\r\nfactories having from fifty-one to 100 employees. This class and the\r\npreceding one contain among them 5½ per cent. of all the industrial\r\nestablishments, and 27½ per cent. of their employees.\r\n\r\nThe class of factories employing from 101 to 500 workmen contains\r\n3,145 establishments (616,000 workmen and other employees). But\r\nthat of from 501 to 1,000 employees per factory has only 295\r\nestablishments, and a total of only 195,000 operatives. Taken\r\ntogether, these two classes contain less than 1 per cent. of all the\r\nestablishments (six per 1,000), and 26 per cent. of all the workmen.\r\n\r\nFinally, the number of factories and works having more than a\r\nthousand workmen and employees each is very small. It is only 149.\r\nOut of them, 108 have from 1,001 to 2,000 workmen, twenty-one have\r\nfrom 2,001 to 5,000, and ten only have more than 5,000 workmen. These\r\n149 very big factories and works give occupation to 313,000 persons\r\nonly, out of more than 3,000,000--that is, only 10 per cent. of all\r\nthe industrial workers.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that more than 99 per cent. of all the industrial\r\nestablishments in France--that is, 571,940 out of 575,529--have less\r\nthan 100 workmen each. They give occupation to 2,000,000 persons, and\r\nrepresent an army of 571,940 employers. More than that. The immense\r\nmajority of that number (568,075 employers) belong to the category\r\nof those who employ less than fifty workmen each. And I do not yet\r\ncount in their number 520,000 employers and artisans who work for\r\nthemselves, or with the aid of a member of the family.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in France, as everywhere, the petty trades\r\nrepresent a very important factor of the industrial life. Economists\r\nhave been too hasty in celebrating their death. And this conclusion\r\nbecomes still more apparent when one analyses the different\r\nindustries separately, taking advantage of the tables given in\r\n_Résultats Statistiques_. A very important fact appears from this\r\nanalysis--namely, that there are only three branches of industry\r\nin which one can speak of a strong “concentration”--the mines,\r\nmetallurgy, and the State’s industries, to which one may add the\r\ntextiles and ironmongery, but always remembering that in these two\r\nbranches immense numbers of small factories continue to prosper by\r\nthe side of the great ones.\r\n\r\nIn all other branches the small trades are dominant, to such an\r\nextent that more than _95 per cent. of the employers employ less\r\nthan fifty workmen each_. In the quarries, in all branches of the\r\nalimentation, in the book trade, clothing, leather, wood, metallic\r\ngoods, and even the brick-works, china and glass works, we hardly\r\nfind one or two factories out of each hundred employing more than\r\nfifty workmen.\r\n\r\nThe three industries that make an exception to this rule are, we\r\nhave said, metallurgy, the great works of the State, and the mines.\r\nIn metallurgy two-thirds of the works have more than fifty men each,\r\nand it is here that we find some twenty great works employing each\r\nof them more than one thousand men. The works of the State, which\r\ninclude the great shipbuilding yards, are evidently in the same\r\ncase. They contain thirty-four establishments, having more than 500\r\nmen each, and fourteen employing more than 1,000. And finally, in\r\nthe mines--one hardly would believe that--more than one-half of all\r\nestablishments employ less than fifty workmen each; but 15 per cent.\r\nof them have more than 500 workmen; forty-one mines are worked by\r\na staff of more than 1,000 persons each, and six out of them employ\r\neven more than 5,000 miners.\r\n\r\nIt is only in these three branches that one finds a rather strong\r\n“concentration”; and yet, the small industry continues to exist, as\r\nwe saw it already in England, by the side of the great one, even in\r\nmining, and still more so in all branches of metallurgy.\r\n\r\nAs to the _textile_ industries, they have exactly the same\r\ncharacter as in England. We find here a certain number of very\r\nlarge establishments (forty establishments having each of them more\r\nthan 1,000 workpeople), and especially we see a great development\r\nof the middle-sized factories (1,300 mills having from 100 to 500\r\nworkpeople). But on the other side, the small industry is also very\r\nnumerous.[211]\r\n\r\nQuite the same is also seen in the manufacture of all _metallic\r\ngoods_ (iron, steel, brass). Here, also, by the side of a few great\r\nworks (seventeen works occupy each of them more than 1,000 workpeople\r\nand salaried employees; out of them five employ more than 2,000\r\npersons, and one more than 5,000); and by the side of a great number\r\nof middle-sized works (440 establishments employing from 100 to 500\r\npersons), we find more than 100,000 artisans who work single-handed,\r\nor with the aid of their families; and 72,600 works which have only\r\nfrom three to four workpeople.\r\n\r\nIn the _india-rubber_ works, and those for the manufacture of\r\n_paper_, the middle-sized factories are still well represented (13\r\nper cent. of all the establishments have more than fifty workmen\r\neach); but the remainder belongs to the small industry. It is the\r\nsame in the _chemical works_. There is in this branch some ten\r\nfactories employing more than 500 persons, and 100 which employ\r\nfrom 101 to 500 people; but the remainder is 1,000 of small works\r\nemploying from ten to fifty people, and 3,800 of the very small works\r\n(less than ten workers).\r\n\r\nIn all other branches it is _the small or the very small industry_\r\nwhich dominates. Thus, in the manufacture of articles of food, there\r\nare only eight factories employing more than 500 people each, and\r\n92,000 small establishments having less than ten workpeople each. In\r\nthe printing industry the immense majority of establishments are very\r\nsmall, and employ from five to ten, or from ten to fifty workpeople.\r\n\r\nAs to the manufacture of _clothing_, it entirely belongs to the small\r\nindustry. Only five factories employ more than 200 each; but the\r\nremainder represents 630,000 independent artisans, men and women;\r\n9,500 workshops where the work is done by the family; and 132,000\r\nworkshops and factories occupying less than ten workpeople each.[212]\r\n\r\nThe different branches dealing with straw, feathers, hair, leather,\r\ngloves, again, belong to the small and the very small industry:\r\n125,000 artisans and 43,000 small establishments employing from three\r\nto four persons each.\r\n\r\nShall I speak of the factories dealing with wood, furniture,\r\nbrushes, and so on? True, there are in these branches two large\r\nfactories employing nearly 2,000 persons; but there are also 214,260\r\nindependent artisans and 105,400 small factories and workshops\r\nemploying less than ten persons each.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say that jewelry, the cutting of precious stones, and\r\nstone-cutting for masonry belong entirely to the small industry,\r\nno more than ten to twenty works employing more than 100 persons\r\neach. Only in ceramics and in brick-making do we find by the side\r\nof the very small works (8,930 establishments), and the small ones\r\n(1,277 establishments employing from ten to fifty workpeople), 334\r\nmiddle-sized works (fifty to 200 workpeople), ninety-three of the\r\ngreat industry (201 to 1,000), and seven of the very great (more than\r\n1,000 workpeople).[213]\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--THE SMALL INDUSTRIES IN GERMANY.\r\n\r\nThe literature of the small industries in Germany being very bulky,\r\nthe chief works upon this subject may be found, either in full or\r\nreviewed, in Schmoller’s _Jahrbücher_, and in Conrad’s _Sammlung\r\nnational-ökonomischer und statistischer Abhandlungen_. For a\r\ngeneral review of the subject and rich bibliographical indications,\r\nSchönberg’s _Volkwirthschaftslehre_, vol. ii., which contains\r\nexcellent remarks about the proper domain of small industries\r\n(p. 401 _seq._), as well as the above-mentioned publication\r\nof K. Bücher (_Untersuchungen über die Lage des Handwerks in\r\nDeutschland_), will be found most valuable. The work of O. Schwarz,\r\n_Die Betriebsformen der modernen Grossindustrie_ (in _Zeitschrift\r\nfür Staatswissenschaft_, vol. xxv., p. 535), is interesting by its\r\nanalysis of the respective advantages of both the great and the small\r\nindustries, which brings the author to formulate the following three\r\nfactors in favour of the former: (1) economy in the cost of motive\r\npower; (2) division of labour and its harmonic organisation; and (3)\r\nthe advantages offered for the sale of the produce. Of these three\r\nfactors, the first is more and more eliminated every year by the\r\nprogress achieved in the transmission of power; the second exists in\r\nsmall industries as well, and to the same extent, as in the great\r\nones (watchmakers, toy-makers, and so on); so that only the third\r\nremains in full force; but this factor, as already mentioned in the\r\ntext of this book, is a _social_ factor which entirely depends upon\r\nthe degree of development of the spirit of association amongst the\r\nproducers.\r\n\r\nA detailed industrial census having been taken in 1907, in addition\r\nto those of 1882 and 1895, most important and quite reliable data\r\nshowing the importance and the resistance of the small industries\r\nwere brought to light, and a series of most interesting monographs\r\ndealing with this subject have been published. Let me name,\r\ntherefore, some of those which could be consulted with profit:\r\nDr. Fr. Zahn, _Wirtschaftliche Entwicklung, unter besonderer\r\nBerücksichtigung der Volkszählung_, 1905, _sowie der Berufs und\r\nBetriebszählung_, 1907; _Sonderabdruck aus der Annalen des Deutschen\r\nReichs_, München, 1910 and 1911; Dr. Josef Grunzel, _System der\r\nIndustriepolitik_, Leipzig, 1905; and _Der Sieg des Industrialismus_,\r\nLeipzig, 1911; W. Sombart, “Verlagssystem (Hausindustrie)”, in\r\nConrad, _Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften_, 3te Auflage,\r\nBd. VIII.; R. van der Borght, _Beruf, Gesellschaftliche Gliederung\r\nund Betrieb im Deutschen Reiche_, in _Vorträge der Gehe-Stiftung_,\r\nBd. II., 1910; and Heinrich Koch, _Die Deutsche Hausindustrie_, M.\r\nGladbach, 1905. Many other works will be found mentioned by these\r\nauthors.\r\n\r\nIn all these books the reader will find a further confirmation of the\r\nideas about the small industries that are expressed in chapters vi.\r\nand vii. When I developed them in the first edition of this book, it\r\nwas objected to me that, although the existence of a great number\r\nof small industries is out of question, and although their great\r\nextension in a country so far advanced in its industrial development\r\nas England was not known to economists, still the fact proves\r\nnothing. These industries are a mere survival; and if we had data\r\nabout the different classes of industry _at different periods_, we\r\nshould see how rapidly the small industries are disappearing.\r\n\r\nNow we have such data for Germany, for a period of twenty-five years,\r\nin the three censuses of 1882, 1895, and 1907, and, what is still\r\nmore valuable, these twenty-five years belong to a moment in the life\r\nof Germany when a powerful industry has developed on an immense\r\nscale with a great rapidity. Here it is that the dying out of the\r\nsmall industries, their “absorption” by the great concerns, and the\r\nsupposed “concentration of capital” ought to be seen in full.\r\n\r\nBut the numerical results, as they appear from the three censuses,\r\nand as they have been interpreted by those who have studied them,\r\nare pointing out to quite the reverse. The position of the small\r\nindustries in the life of an industrial country is exactly the same\r\nwhich could have been foreseen twenty-five years ago, and very often\r\nit is described in the very same words that I have used.\r\n\r\nThe German _Statistisches Jahrbuch_ gives us the distribution of\r\nworkmen in the different industries of the German Empire in 1882 and\r\n1895. Leaving aside all the concerns which belong to trade and those\r\nfor the sale of alcoholic drinks (955,680 establishments, 2,165,638\r\nworkpeople), as also 42,321 establishments belonging to horticulture,\r\nfishing, and poultry (103,128 workpeople in 1895), there were, in\r\nall the industries, including mining, 1,237,000 artisans working\r\nsingle-handed, and over 900,000 establishments in which 6,730,500\r\npersons were employed. Their distribution in establishments of\r\ndifferent sizes was as follows:--\r\n\r\n           1895.                   Establish-     Employees.   Average\r\n                                      ments.                  per estab-\r\n                                                               lishment.\r\n  Artisans working single-handed    1,237,000     1,237,000[214]     --\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  From 1 to 5 employees               752,572     1,954,125       2·6\r\n   ”   6 to 50    ”                   139,459     1,902,049        13\r\n  Over 50         ”                    17,941     2,907,329       162\r\n                                    ---------     ---------       ---\r\n        Total                         909,972     6,763,503       7·5\r\n  (With the artisans)              (2,146,972)   (8,000,503)      (4)\r\n\r\n  Twelve years later the industries, as they appeared\r\n  in the next census, made in 1907, were distributed as\r\n  follows:--\r\n\r\n        1907.

Such an individual mode of production\r\nby hand is naturally on the decrease, even many artisans resorting\r\nnow to some sort of motive power and taking one or two hired aids;\r\nbut this does not prove in the least that the small industries\r\ncarried on with the aid of machinery should be on the wane. The\r\ncensus of 1907 proves quite the contrary, and all those who have\r\nstudied it are bound to recognise it.\r\n\r\n“Of a pronounced decay of the small establishments in which five or\r\nless persons are employed, is, of course, no sign,” writes Dr. Zahn\r\nin the afore-mentioned work. Out of the 14·3 million people who live\r\non industry, full 5·4 million belong to the small industry.\r\n\r\nFar from decreasing, this category has considerably increased since\r\n1895 (from 732,572 establishments with 1,954,125 employees in 1895,\r\nto 875,518 establishments and 2,205,539 employees in 1907). Moreover,\r\nit is not only the very small industry which is on the increase;\r\nit is also the small one which has increased even more than the\r\npreceding--namely, by 47,615 establishments and 812,139 employees.\r\n\r\nAs to the very great industry, a closer analysis of what the German\r\nstatisticians describe as giant establishments (_Riesenbetriebe_)\r\nshows that they belong chiefly to industries working for the State,\r\nor created in consequence of State-granted monopolies. Thus, for\r\ninstance, the Krupp Shareholders Company employ 69,500 persons in\r\ntheir nine different establishments, and everyone knows that the\r\nworks of Krupp are in reality a dependency of the State.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of the above-named German authors about the facts\r\nrevealed by the industrial censuses are very interesting.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the small industries in Germany, W. Sombart writes\r\nin the article, “Verlagssystem (Hausindustrie),” in Conrad’s\r\n_Handwörterbuch_: “It results from the census of 1907 that the losses\r\nin the small industries are almost exclusively limited to those\r\nhome industries which are usually described as the _old ones_; while\r\nthe increases belong to the home industries of modern origin.” The\r\nstatistical data thus confirm that “at the present time a sort of\r\nrejuvenation is going on in the home industries; instead of those\r\nof them which are dying out, new ones, almost equal in numbers, are\r\ngrowing up” (p. 242). Prof. Sombart points out that the same is going\r\non in Switzerland, and refers to some new works on this subject.[216]\r\n\r\nDr. J. Grunzel comes to a similar conclusion: “Life experience shows\r\nthat the home industries are not a form of industrial organisation\r\nwhich has had its time,” he writes in his afore-mentioned work. “On\r\nthe contrary, it proves to be possessed of a great life force in\r\ncertain branches. It is spread in all branches in which handwork\r\noffers advantages above the work of the machine” (p. 46). It is also\r\nretained wherever the value of labour exceeds very much the value of\r\nthe raw produce; and finally, in all the branches devoted to articles\r\nwhich are rapidly changing with the seasons or the vagaries of\r\nfashion. And he shows (pp. 46 and 149) how the home industries have\r\nbeen increasing in Germany from 1882 to 1895, and how they are widely\r\nspread in Austria, France, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, and England.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions of R. van der Borght are quite similar.\r\n\r\n“It is true,” Dr. van der Borght says, “that the numbers of artisans\r\nworking single-handed have diminished in numbers in most industries;\r\nbut they still represent two-fifths of all industrial establishments,\r\nand even more than one-half in several industries. At the same time,\r\nthe small establishments (having from one to five workers) have\r\nincreased in numbers, and they contain nearly one-half of all the\r\nindustrial establishments, and even more than that in several groups.”\r\n\r\nAs for Koch’s work, _Die Deutsche Hausindustrie_, it deserves special\r\nmention for the discussion it contains of the measures advocated,\r\non the one side, for the weeding out of the domestic industries,\r\nand, on the other side, for improving the condition of the workers\r\nand the industries themselves by the means of co-operation, credit,\r\nworkshops’ inspection, and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\nY.--THE DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES IN SWITZERLAND.\r\n\r\nWe have most interesting monographs dealing with separate branches\r\nof the small industries of Switzerland, but we have not yet such\r\ncomprehensive statistical data as those which have been mentioned\r\nin the text in speaking of Germany and France. It was only in\r\nthe year 1901 that the first attempt was made to get the exact\r\nnumbers of workpeople employed in what the Swiss statisticians\r\ndescribe as _Hausindustrie_, or “the domestic industries’ extension\r\nof the factory industries” (_der hausindustrielle Anhang der\r\nFabrikindustrie_). Up till then these numbers remained “an absolutely\r\nunknown quantity.” For many it was, therefore, a revelation when\r\na first rough estimate, made by the factory inspectors, gave the\r\nfigure of 52,291 workpeople belonging to this category, as against\r\n243,200 persons employed in all the factories, large and small,\r\nof the same branches. A few years later, Schuler, in _Zeitung für\r\nSchweizerische Statistik_, 1904 (reprinted since as a volume), came\r\nto the figure of 131,299 persons employed in the domestic industries;\r\nand yet this figure, although it is much nearer to reality than the\r\nformer, is still below the real numbers. Finally, an official census\r\nof the industries, made in 1905, gave the figure of 92,162 persons\r\nemployed in the domestic industries in 70,873 establishments, in the\r\nfollowing branches--textiles, watches and jewellery, straw-plaiting,\r\nclothing and dress, wood-carving, tobacco. They thus represent more\r\nthan one-fourth (28·5 per cent.) of the 317,027 operatives employed\r\nin Switzerland in these same branches, and 15·7 per cent. of all the\r\nindustrial operatives, who numbered 585,574 in 1905.\r\n\r\nOut of the just-mentioned 92,162 workpeople, registered as belonging\r\nto the domestic trades, nearly three-quarters (66,061 in 49,168\r\nestablishments) belong to the textile industry, chiefly knitting\r\nand the silks; then comes the watch-trade (12,871 persons in 9,186\r\nestablishments), straw-plaiting, and dress. However, these figures\r\nare still incomplete. Not only several smaller branches of the\r\ndomestic trades were omitted in the census, but also the children\r\nunder fourteen years of age employed in the domestic trades, whose\r\nnumbers are estimated at 32,300, were not counted. Besides, the\r\ncensus having been made in the summer, during the “strangers’\r\nseason,” a considerable number of persons employed in a variety of\r\ndomestic trades during the winter did not appear in the census.\r\n\r\nIt must also be noted that the Swiss census includes under the name\r\nof _Heimarbeit_ (domestic trades) only those “dependencies of the\r\nindustrial employers” which do not represent separate factories\r\nplaced under the employer’s management; so that those workshops\r\nand small factories, the produce of which is sold directly to the\r\nconsumers, as also the small factories directly managed by small\r\nemployers, are not included in this category. If all that be taken\r\ninto consideration, we must agree with the conclusion that the\r\n“domestic trades have in Switzerland a much greater extension than\r\nin any other country of Europe” (save Russia), which we find in\r\nan elaborate recent work, published in connection with the 1910\r\nexhibition of Swiss domestic industries, and edited by Herr Jac.\r\nLorenz (_Die wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Verhältnisse in der\r\nSchweizerischen Heimarbeit_, Zurich, 1910-1911, p. 27).\r\n\r\nA feature of importance which appears from this last work is, that\r\nmore than one-half of the workers engaged in domestic trades have\r\nsome other source of income besides these trades. Very many of them\r\ncarry on agriculture, so that it has been said that in Switzerland\r\n“the domestic trades’ question is as much _a peasant question_ as a\r\nlabour question.”\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to sum up in this place the interesting data\r\ncontained in the first four fascicles published by Herr Lorenz, which\r\ndeal with the cotton, the silk, and the linen domestic industries,\r\ntheir struggles against the machine, their defeats in some branches\r\nand their holding the ground in other branches, and so on. I must\r\ntherefore refer the reader to this very instructive publication.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[199] “Great Britain’s Capital Investments in Other Lands” (_Journal\r\nof the Statistical Society_, September 1909, vol. lxxii., pp.\r\n475-495), followed by a most interesting discussion; and “Great\r\nBritain’s Capital Investments in India, Colonial and Foreign\r\nCountries,” same journal, January 1911, vol. lxxiv., pp. 167-200.\r\n\r\n[200] T.

Euvert,\r\nPresident of the Chamber of Commerce of St. Etienne, who sent me,\r\nwhile I was in the Clairvaux prison, in April, 1885, a most valuable\r\nsketch of the various industries of the region, in reply to a letter\r\nof mine, and I avail myself of the opportunity for expressing to M.\r\nEuvert my best thanks for his courtesy. This information has now an\r\nhistorical value only. But it is such an interesting page of the\r\nhistory of the small industries that I retain it as it was in the\r\nfirst edition, the more so as it is most interesting to compare it\r\nwith the pages given in the text to the present conditions of the\r\nsame industries.\r\n\r\n[206] It had been 5,134,000 kilogrammes in 1872. _Journal de la\r\nSociété de Statistique de Paris_, September, 1883.\r\n\r\n[207] I take these figures from a detailed letter which the President\r\nof the Lyons Chamber of Commerce kindly directed to me in April,\r\n1885, to Clairvaux, in answer to my inquiries about the subject.
