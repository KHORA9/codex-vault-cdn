Its purpose is to aid in the industrial\r\ndevelopment of the state and nation by scientific research and by\r\nfurnishing information for the solution of engineering problems.\r\n\r\n     The scope of the work is twofold:--\r\n\r\n     (a) To investigate and to publish information concerning\r\n     engineering problems of a more or less general nature that would\r\n     be helpful in municipal, rural and industrial affairs.\r\n\r\n     (b) To undertake extended research and to publish reports on\r\n     engineering and scientific problems.\r\n\r\nThe control of the Station is vested in a Station Staff consisting of\r\nthe President of the University, the Dean of the College of Engineering\r\nas ex-officio Director, and seven members of the Faculty. The Staff\r\ndetermines the character of the investigations to be undertaken and\r\nsupervises the work. For administrative purposes the work of the Station\r\nis organized into seven divisions--\r\n\r\n  1. Forest Products\r\n  2. Mining and Metallurgy\r\n  3. Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry\r\n  4. Civil Engineering\r\n  5. Electrical Engineering\r\n  6. Mechanical Engineering\r\n  7. Physics Standards and Tests\r\n\r\nThe results of the investigations are published in the form of\r\nbulletins. Requests for copies of the bulletins and inquiries for\r\ninformation on engineering and industrial problems should be addressed\r\nto the Director, Engineering Experiment Station, University of\r\nWashington, Seattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  BULLETIN\r\n\r\n  UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n  ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION\r\n\r\n  ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION SERIES\r\n\r\n  BULLETIN NO. 12\r\n\r\n  MOTOR TRUCK LOGGING METHODS\r\n\r\n  BY\r\n\r\n  FREDERICK MALCOLM KNAPP\r\n\r\n  Student in the College of Forestry,\r\n  University of Washington.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON\r\n  PUBLISHED QUARTERLY BY THE UNIVERSITY\r\n  APRIL, 1921\r\n\r\n  Entered as second class matter, at Seattle, under the Act of\r\n  July 16, 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    Page\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTION                                                         5\r\n\r\n  HISTORY OF TRUCK LOGGING                                             5\r\n  First use of motor truck in logging--Development of logging\r\n  trailer--Possibilities in the use of motor trucks.\r\n\r\n  TRANSPORTATION OF LOGS--RAILROADS VERSUS MOTOR TRUCKS                7\r\n  Comparative advantages and uses of motor trucks and railroads--\r\n  Relative cost of road construction--Advantage of flexibility of\r\n  motor trucks.\r\n\r\n  COSTS                                                                8\r\n  Operating costs of a typical 5-ton truck--Actual cash outlay--\r\n  Total expense--Variable charges--Recapitulation of work\r\n  performed.\r\n\r\n  ROLLING STOCK EQUIPMENT                                             10\r\n  Rigid versus flexible truck bodies--Chain drive versus worm\r\n  drive--Weight of trucks--Speed--Depreciation.\r\n\r\n  INSURANCE                                                           14\r\n  Fire and theft insurance--Collision insurance--Liability\r\n  insurance--Property damage insurance.\r\n\r\n  TRUCK EQUIPMENT                                                     14\r\n  Bunks--Tires--Relative advantages of different types of  tires\r\n  --Laws governing operation of motor vehicles--Legal limit of\r\n  weight of load--Chain drives--Tops.\r\n\r\n  TRAILERS                                                            17\r\n  Draw-bar pull of motor trucks--Effect of grades on draw-bar\r\n  pull--Advantage of trailer--Description of trailer--Brakes on\r\n  trailer--Air brakes on trailers.\r\n\r\n  LIFE AND DEPRECIATION                                               20\r\n\r\n  COST DATA                                                           20\r\n  Operating expenses for 31/2 and 5-ton trucks--Fixed charges--\r\n  Total expenses.\r\n\r\n  ROAD CONSTRUCTION                                                   24\r\n  Sub-grade--Cross-plank roads--Fore and aft pole roads--Cement\r\n  roads--Guard rails--Cost of road construction.\r\n\r\n  BRIDGES                                                             36\r\n\r\n  TURNING DEVICES AND TURNOUTS                                        37\r\n  Construction of turn-tables--Turning of trucks.\r\n\r\n  TELEPHONES                                                          39\r\n\r\n  INCLINES                                                            39\r\n  Snubbing methods--Practicability of inclines.\r\n\r\n  YARDING                                                             41\r\n\r\n  LOADING AND HAULING                                                 41\r\n  Methods of loading trucks--Loading with boom--Rigging of\r\n  boom--Unloading.\r\n\r\n  TIME STUDIES                                                        45\r\n\r\n  CONCLUSION                                                          46\r\n  Future use of the motor truck--Motor trucks and forestry.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY                                                        48\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this paper an attempt has been made to bring together some useful\r\nfacts concerning the application of the motor truck to the logging\r\nindustry. The term \"motor truck\" as here used is applied to the ordinary\r\ntruck type of motor vehicle with trailer adapted to carrying logs, and\r\ndoes not include the \"tractor\" and the \"caterpillar tractor.\" These\r\nlatter types present special problems of their own. In the following\r\npages the discussion of motor truck logging is premised upon conditions\r\nas they exist in the forests of the Pacific Northwest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF TRUCK LOGGING\r\n\r\n\r\nMotor trucks in the logging industry are a comparatively recent\r\ndevelopment. As nearly as can be determined, the first use of a truck in\r\na logging operation was made in this region by Palms and Shields near\r\nCovington, Washington, in the spring of 1913. Since that time various\r\ntypes of road construction suitable for heavy trucks have been devised\r\nand the use of the motor truck for logging has steadily increased until\r\nat the present time there are about six hundred trucks operating in the\r\nwoods in the Northwest.\r\n\r\nThe first real progress in the use of the motor truck for logging\r\npurposes came with the development of the trailer. Although the motor\r\ntruck has been brought to its present high state of perfection in\r\neastern factories the problem of adapting it to the hauling of massive\r\nlogs was solved in Seattle, Washington, with the perfecting of a trailer\r\nwhich could carry unprecedented loads and stand up under the speed\r\nattained by a motor truck. In the early attempts to design a trailer,\r\nit was found that too great tractive effort on the part of the truck\r\nwas required if the trailer was patterned after older types with\r\nsimply increased dimensions in all of its parts. Through successive\r\nimprovements the modern form of heavy duty trailer was finally evolved.\r\nIt has solved a serious problem by permitting the hauling of heavier\r\nweights with the aid of the trailer than is possible with the use of the\r\ntruck alone. With the help of the trailer and an adjustable reach, the\r\nmotor truck has successfully entered the logging field.\r\n\r\nIn the Pacific Northwest tracts of timber of sufficient area well\r\nsituated for economical logging by old established methods are no longer\r\nplentiful. Almost every logging chance which exists today presents its\r\nown peculiar conditions and individual problems. An operator must\r\ntherefore analyze the situation thoroughly before arriving at a decision\r\nas to the most economical logging methods that will apply in any\r\nparticular case. Even in different sections of the same operation it is\r\noften necessary to use different methods. Since proper cost accounting\r\nsystems are not usually kept by logging companies, particularly the\r\nsmaller concerns, these companies often do not know that they are losing\r\nmoney upon one part of an operation because the success of the whole\r\nabsorbs this loss.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pioneer logging with a motor truck in 1913.]\r\n\r\nThe use of a motor truck has proved to be practicable in many instances,\r\nand bids fair to become of increasing importance. It will therefore\r\nbe advantageous for every operator to inquire into its possible\r\napplications. It should be emphasized, however, that the motor truck is\r\nnot economically adapted to all conditions. There have been many\r\nfailures. Each projected application of the motor truck in the logging\r\nfield must be thoroughly analyzed and if a doubt as to its successful\r\nperformance exists, expert advice should be sought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION OF LOGS--RAILROADS VERSUS MOTOR TRUCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal methods of transporting logs are by rail, by motor truck\r\nand by animal power. The last of these methods is, for obvious reasons,\r\nimpracticable in the Northwest, and so needs no further comment. While\r\nit is impossible to give specific details in a general discussion of\r\nthis kind to show where the motor truck may be more economically suited\r\nto the conditions at hand than the railroad, a comparison of the\r\nfundamental principles involved should enable any operator familiar with\r\nlogging to determine whether or not to use the truck for his particular\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nIn general the choice between railroad and motor truck logging depends,\r\nfundamentally, upon two things: (1) comparative cost, and (2)\r\nadaptability. Sufficient motive power and rolling stock can be obtained\r\nmuch more cheaply for motor truck logging than for a railroad. There\r\nare, of course, many situations where the locomotive and car costs, as\r\nwell as those of constructing a logging railroad, are obviously\r\nprohibitive, and the question revolves entirely upon the adaptability of\r\nthe motor truck to existing conditions. There is no question at all that\r\nthe logging railroad is not adapted to small, isolated and scattering\r\ntracts, and to certain portions of larger operations. There are almost\r\ninnumerable tracts situated close to public highways, or where temporary\r\nroads can be built, which may be very serviceable during the summer\r\nmonths, giving ample time to clean up the timber before wet weather sets\r\nin. In such instances, road construction and maintenance costs are of\r\nvery minor importance. In the larger operations and in the use of the\r\nmotor truck as an auxiliary to railroad logging, there are many\r\nopportunities for the reduction of logging costs. However, it is\r\nimpossible to discuss these problems specifically in a paper of this\r\nkind. They will need to be worked out on the ground with each case as a\r\ndistinct problem. The fundamental problems covered in this paper will\r\nserve as a basis for the more detailed problems that must be solved on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nWherever the item of road construction is important, it may be stated in\r\ngeneral that the time required and the cost of building roads for motor\r\ntrucks are very much less than for a logging railroad. This is due to\r\nthe lesser importance of grades, curves, ballasting, bridges and other\r\nconstruction work, all of which is much cheaper and takes less time. In\r\ncase a pole road is built the material found adjacent to the right of\r\nway can be utilized for what it costs to fell it.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of adaptability the motor truck is very flexible. It\r\ncan operate on grades and curves that are impossible with the railroad.\r\nThe whole logging equipment, including the donkey engine, can be loaded\r\non the truck and trailer and easily moved from one setting to another.\r\nBy replacing the log bunk with a platform the truck can take out all the\r\nsmaller marketable material, such as shingle bolts, poles and cordwood.\r\nThe modern truck can also be provided with the necessary equipment for\r\nuse in snaking out the logs in stands of small timber and when used with\r\na winch and an \"A\" shaped boom, will load itself. If the truck becomes\r\nmired in a mud hole, the winch may be used to pull it out. Finally, the\r\nitem of fire risk is practically negligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to arrive at definite figures as a basis for a comparison\r\nbetween railroad and motor truck transportation costs, the following\r\ncase is cited as an example representing average good conditions:[1] A\r\n5-ton truck with trailer was used, operating on a seven and one-half\r\nmile haul over ordinary unpaved roads. An average of four trips a day\r\nwere made and the actual running expense for hauling was $.901/2 per\r\nthousand feet. Adding to this the overhead expenses of interest,\r\ndepreciation, etc., the total cost of hauling was $1.44 per thousand\r\nfeet. The statement of this cost is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nACTUAL CASH OUTLAY IN HAULING 128,420 BOARD FEET OF LOGS\r\n\r\n  Gasoline, 284 gallons @ $.19                   $53.96\r\n  Oil, 3 gallons @ $.60                            1.80\r\n  Oil, 201/2 gallons @ $.45                          9.23\r\n  Incidentals--One electric light globe             .35\r\n    Hardware                                       4.03\r\n    Blacksmith                                     3.00\r\n  Driver, 11 days @ $4.00                         44.00\r\n                                               --------\r\n                  Total                         $116.37\r\n\r\n128,420 feet @ $116.37, or $.901/2 per thousand feet.\r\n\r\n  [1] West Coast Lumberman.

Four hours lost getting the road\r\n      cleared.\r\n\r\n  [3] Two hours lost at the landing due to a spring slipping out of\r\n      place, which made it necessary to unload and load again.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany loggers who have used both the steam railroad and the motor truck\r\nclaim that the latter is preferable in some cases and often is the only\r\nmethod by means of which logs can be gotten to the mill at a reasonable\r\ncost. Where the stand is scattered and of poor quality, the building of\r\na railroad is not practical. In such a case the motor truck may offer\r\nthe only solution.\r\n\r\nThe motor truck makes the best showing when hauling from one \"side.\"\r\nWith a two or three side operation the railroad is by far the more\r\npractical. It must be remembered, however, that the railroad and the\r\nmotor truck are not competitors in the logging industry--they are\r\nallies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROLLING STOCK EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general two plans are followed in building a motor truck. The first\r\nis to build a rigid truck so that it will resist all shocks and\r\ndistortions that come from rough and uneven roads. The second plan is to\r\nbuild a flexible body so that the chassis will \"give\" rather than resist\r\nwhen subjected to hard strains. Although the rigidly-built truck may be\r\nentirely satisfactory for most forms of trucking, it is practically\r\nimpossible to build one on the rigid principle that will stand up under\r\nthe heavy strains to which a logging truck is subjected unless it is to\r\nbe operated over good paved roads. When only ordinary unpaved public\r\nroads are available, flexibility is one of the most important\r\ncharacteristics to look for when selecting a truck. Where the operator\r\nis hauling over his own pole or plank road this consideration does not\r\nplay so important a part, as the road bed then is more likely to be free\r\nfrom holes and irregularities.\r\n\r\nAll makes of trucks are more or less alike in general construction,\r\ndiffering only in minor details, so that the personal whims of the buyer\r\nwill largely determine the kind he will select. It is advantageous to\r\nhave as long a distance as possible between the driver's seat and the\r\nbunk over the rear axle, in order to allow more of the load to be\r\ncarried by the truck, and less by the trailer, giving better traction to\r\nthe drive wheels, but necessitating extra strong rear springs and axles.\r\n\r\nThe type of power transmission best suited to the use of the logging\r\ntruck is a question that has received a great deal of attention. There\r\nare three general methods of transmitting the power: (1) by chain; (2)\r\nby worm drive, and (3) by internal gear drive. Each has its advantages.\r\nIt is claimed by many that the chain drive saves many hours of\r\n\"shut-down time\" due to the fact that if anything breaks in the\r\ntransmission, it will be a link in the chain as this is the weakest\r\npoint. It is then only a matter of a few minutes to insert another link.\r\nWith the worm driven vehicle, a break in the transmission requires an\r\nexpensive shut-down before the matter can be repaired. The worm drive,\r\non the other hand, very seldom breaks if proper care is used.\r\n\r\nThe chain drive also allows the replacement of the sprocket with one of\r\na larger or smaller diameter thereby giving a higher or lower gear\r\nratio, which cannot be done with the worm gear. This seems to be of some\r\nadvantage to an operator when changing his setting from one with a short\r\nhaul and steep grades where a low gear ratio is required, to one where\r\nthe haul is long and fairly level, and where speed in transit is an\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in starting on slippery grades or wherever the\r\ntraction is poor, the worm drive will give better traction than a chain\r\ndrive because there is difficulty in taking up the slack that is always\r\npresent in the chain before letting in the clutch fully. The slightest\r\njerk given to the wheels when the slack is taken up is likely to cause\r\nthem to spin, thereby losing all the tractive power of the drive wheels.\r\nIn the worm gear there is no slack to take up and the power can be\r\napplied more gradually, thus reducing the chances of spinning the wheels\r\nand losing the traction.\r\n\r\nThe question of the weight of the truck used for logging purposes is not\r\nas important now as it will be in the future. Laws are being passed in\r\nnearly every state limiting the maximum weight to be carried on each\r\nwheel by trucks using state or county roads so that the total weight of\r\nthe truck without load will be important. When operating over state or\r\ncounty roads the load is limited to from 2400 to 3000 feet, B. M., of\r\nDouglas fir, depending upon the locality. In such cases, it is an\r\nadvantage to have a lighter truck, say one of 31/2 tons capacity. By\r\nadding additional leaves to the rear springs of a truck of this capacity\r\nit may be made to carry a larger load than it would be possible to put\r\non a 5-ton truck and still comply with the law. The pulling power of the\r\n31/2-ton truck and the 5-ton truck is practically the same so that the\r\ndifference in dead weight between the two may be carried in a profitable\r\nmanner by adding four or five hundred feet B. M. of logs. Another\r\nadvantage of the lighter weight truck is _speed_. The 31/2-ton truck is\r\ngeared to make from 14 to 16 miles an hour, while the 5-ton truck is\r\nusually limited to from 10 to 12 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nWhenever the legal weight limit does not enter into the problem, as in\r\noperating over a pole or plank road for the entire distance, it is, of\r\ncourse, advantageous to carry the largest loads possible. In such cases\r\na 5-ton truck with an 81/2-ton trailer is the most profitable investment.\r\nThis allows a much larger load to be carried in proportion to the\r\noverhead charges. The disadvantage of the 5-ton truck is that it is very\r\nheavy and unless the roads are good, it will easily sink into the ground\r\nand cause trouble. A common fault of the 5-ton truck today is the\r\noverweight of the front end, which is too heavy for the width of tire on\r\nthe front wheels. This can be very easily overcome by the use of wider\r\ntires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE AND DEPRECIATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe life of a truck is directly proportional to the care that it\r\nreceives, hence, a good driver is a most important consideration. If the\r\nright man can be secured his wages should be a secondary consideration.\r\n\r\nThe charge to be made for the depreciation of a truck is an uncertain\r\nquestion. Some loggers figure on the basis of four and a half years,\r\nothers on as much as seven years. The depreciation charge on a truck\r\nused in the logging industry should depend largely upon the type of road\r\nover which it is operated. Loggers in general over-rate the life of\r\ntheir equipment because they do not fully realize the severity of the\r\nwork. Over a fore and aft plank road or a cement road, where the jar and\r\nvibration are reduced to a minimum, the wear and tear on the equipment\r\nis very much less than where the truck is operated over a cross-plank\r\nroad or an unpaved public road. The matter of depreciation, then, will\r\ndepend largely upon the type of road over which the truck is to operate.\r\nIn general a four-year depreciation charge less 25% sale value at the\r\nend of that time should be used as a basis for figuring costs unless the\r\nhauling conditions are very favorable. Only under very rare\r\ncircumstances should more than four years be allowed. It should be\r\nremembered that the depreciation on a truck is very heavy during the\r\nfirst year, and the sale value at the end of a year is only half the\r\noriginal price. Many truck operators now hauling over good roads who are\r\ndepreciating on the basis of five years say that a four-year\r\ndepreciation would be more nearly correct. Another factor in favor of a\r\nfour-year depreciation charge is that methods of logging are changing\r\nconstantly and that trucks in that time may be improved upon to such an\r\nextent that the use of the old equipment would be unprofitable and\r\ninefficient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Swivel bunk on truck equipped for motor truck logging.\r\nThe base on which the bunk rests is made of two heavy timbers about 18\r\ninches by 24 inches in section and 4 feet long, bolted together and\r\nclamped to the frame of the truck by means of heavy N-bolts, (D). The\r\nbunk is fastened by a king-pin (E) to the base and is free to rotate\r\nupon a steel center plate and two side-bearing plates (F).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSURANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe insurance rates on trucks depend upon the use to which they are put.\r\nThe insurance usually carried by loggers covers fire and theft, although\r\nsome companies also carry liability and either collision or property\r\ndamage insurance. The equipment can be insured for only ninety per cent\r\nof its value.\r\n\r\nFire and theft insurance is based upon the list price of the truck and\r\nbody when new and the usual premium for the logging truck is one dollar\r\nfor every hundred dollars of insured value. Theft rates on the trailer\r\nare based on a flat charge of twenty-five cents per hundred dollars of\r\ninsurance taken, regardless of age, list price, etcetera.\r\n\r\nCollision insurance is based upon the list price of the equipment and\r\ncovers full value at the time of loss of the damage to the truck by\r\ncolliding with anything movable or immovable.\r\n\r\nThe liability rate for logging trucks is $33.75 and is based upon\r\noccupation alone. This covers the public as well as the employee and is\r\nlimited to $5,000 for one person and $10,000 for two persons or more.\r\n\r\nThe property damage rate for logging trucks is $13.50, and covers the\r\ndamage done to the property of others. It is arrived at in the same way\r\nas liability insurance. The usual limit for property damage is $1,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRUCK EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bunks._ All trucks for use in log hauling are equipped with a patent\r\nbunk over the rear axle on which the logs rest (see illustration on page\r\n13). This is essentially a steel I-beam (A) which grips the logs so that\r\nthey will not slip. At each end of the bunk are V-shaped iron\r\nchock-blocks (B) held by chains which run under the I-beam and are\r\nfastened by an iron gooseneck hook (C) so that the load is kept from\r\nspreading. These blocks may be adjusted to any width of load. The whole\r\nbunk is mounted on a swivel so that it will turn with the logs when\r\nrounding a sharp turn in the road. When dumping the logs at the landing,\r\neach block is loosened from the opposite side so that the danger of the\r\nlogs rolling off on the men is greatly lessened.\r\n\r\n_Tires._ Solid rubber tires are generally conceded to be the best suited\r\nfor the heavy duty required in logging. The use of steel tires is\r\nrapidly declining. The jar on the equipment is in itself enough to\r\ncondemn their use. Rubber tires double the mileage of a day's work, more\r\nthan double the life of the equipment, allow the weight of the equipment\r\nto be cut in half, and work well on dirt, cement, or any other type of\r\nroad. The saving on the life of a pole or plank road by the use of\r\nrubber tires is also an item of considerable importance. There are three\r\ngeneral types of solid rubber tires in use on the logging truck: the\r\nso-called giant tires, the duals, and the non-skid or caterpillar tires.\r\nIt is a question as to which of the three is the best. Traction for the\r\ndrive wheels and also for the trailer wheels, if the latter are equipped\r\nwith brakes, is the problem to be solved.\r\n\r\nThe duals are satisfactory with light loads and easy grades, on cement,\r\nbrick, or other perfect surface road, but when the haul is heavy and the\r\nbraking difficult on account of heavy grades, the larger single-tread\r\ngiant tires are more efficient. During dry weather it is safe to work\r\nwith the single-tread tires on grades as high as nine or ten per cent,\r\nbut in wet weather a seven per cent grade should be the maximum unless\r\nsome extra means are taken to secure traction, and even then the wheels\r\nwill skid if particles of soil get on the surface of a plank road,\r\nunless chains are used or the wheel is wrapped with a light cable.[4]\r\nFor very heavy-duty trucking, where resiliency and long service are\r\nprime considerations, the giant type is rapidly superseding the old dual\r\ntype as the former contains more rubber and gives more mileage with the\r\nleast truck vibration.\r\n\r\n  [4] West Coast Lumberman. October, 1919. Page 25.\r\n\r\nThe non-skid or caterpillar tire may well be used on heavy grades or\r\nwhere the traction is very poor, the general opinion being that it gives\r\na firmer grip on the road and makes it safer to handle the truck in wet\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nThere is no standard width of tread for truck wheels. The widths usually\r\nused on the drive wheels of the logging truck and the wheels of the\r\ntrailer are twelve and fourteen inches, respectively. The use of tires\r\nof smaller width on either trailer or truck cannot be recommended. The\r\nwider the tires on the trailer, the better it is both for the life of\r\nthe equipment and for ease in handling the load. When the surface of the\r\ngiant tires becomes worn down so that the grooves become very shallow,\r\nit is desirable to have the tires re-grooved. They will last a great\r\ndeal longer if this is done and will also give better traction on the\r\nroad. The groove makes the tire lobes act separately on the uneven\r\nplaces in the road so that only one lobe is subjected to the strain of\r\nthe irregularities instead of the whole tire. This is also true with\r\nreference to the strains that are set up internally due to the twisting\r\nof the rubber.\r\n\r\n\r\n     LAWS GOVERNING THE OPERATION OF MOTOR VEHICLES\r\n\r\n     The Laws governing the operation of motor vehicles upon the\r\n     public highways of the State of Washington are contained and\r\n     summarized in Senate Bill No. 220, Session of 1921 of the\r\n     Legislature of the State of Washington. They include the\r\n     following provisions governing the operation of motor trucks and\r\n     trailers:\r\n\r\n     (a) Chapter 153 of the laws of 1913 and Chapter 142 of the laws\r\n     of 1915 are repealed.\r\n\r\n     (b) Motor truck vehicles weighing less than 1,500 pounds must pay\r\n     an annual license fee of ten dollars ($10.00); Trucks weighing\r\n     more than 1,500 pounds and not to exceed 6,500 pounds, ten\r\n     dollars ($10.00) plus forty cents per hundredweight for all in\r\n     excess of 1,500 pounds and in addition thereto fifty cents per\r\n     hundredweight at the rated carrying capacity. Motor trucks\r\n     weighing more than 6,500 pounds must pay a license fee of ten\r\n     dollars ($10.00) plus fifty cents per hundredweight for all in\r\n     excess of 1,500 pounds and in addition thereto fifty cents per\r\n     hundredweight at the rated carrying capacity. Trailers =used as\r\n     trucks= shall be classified and rated as, and shall pay the same\r\n     fees as hereinbefore provided for motor trucks of like weight and\r\n     capacity.\r\n\r\n     (c) No vehicle of four wheels or less whose gross weight with\r\n     load is over 24,000 pounds is permitted to operate over or along\r\n     a public highway. Any vehicle having a greater weight than 22,400\r\n     pounds on one axle, or any vehicle having a combined weight of\r\n     800 pounds per inch-width of tire concentrated upon the surface\r\n     of the highway (said width of tire in the case of solid rubber\r\n     tires to be measured between the flanges of the rim) is also\r\n     barred by the provisions of this law, with the following\r\n     exception:\r\n\r\n     PROVIDED, that in special cases vehicles whose weight including\r\n     loads whose weight exceeds those herein prescribed, may operate\r\n     under special written permits, which must be first obtained and\r\n     under such terms and conditions as to time, route, equipment,\r\n     speed and otherwise as shall be determined by the director of\r\n     licenses if it is desired to use a state highway; the county\r\n     commissioners, if it is desired to use a county road; the city or\r\n     town council, if it is desired to use a city or town street; from\r\n     each of which officer or officers such permit shall be obtained\r\n     in the respective cases. Provided, that no motor truck or trailer\r\n     shall be driven over or on a public highway with a load exceeding\r\n     the licensed capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chain Drive._ Trucks equipped with a chain drive should be supplied\r\nwith an extra set of chains so that they may be changed and cleaned\r\nevery week. To clean the chains, they should be soaked in kerosene which\r\nremoves the dirt, grease and gum that has accumulated. By doing this the\r\nlife of the chains will be quadrupled. The small amount of time that it\r\ntakes will pay.\r\n\r\n_Top._ The truck should come equipped with a top over the driver's seat\r\nthat is easily detachable. In bad weather the driver should be protected\r\nfrom the elements, but the top should be removed in good weather as it\r\nis in constant danger of being broken during loading. Many operators\r\nleave the top off entirely and the driver must dress for the weather. A\r\ngood demountable top will add to the comfort of the men and often helps\r\nto keep a good man at his job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAILERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe development of the trailer has made motor truck logging practical.\r\nEvery truck has greater tractive power than it can utilize in the\r\npropulsion of the ordinary load. Its limitations are due to a short-bulk\r\ncarrying capacity and not to any lack of pulling power. The ordinary\r\ntruck has a draw-bar pull of 2600 pounds. The draw-bar pull per ton of\r\nload varies from the minimum of 50 pounds on a level pavement to 250\r\npounds on a level dirt road, depending upon the character of surface.[5]\r\nTwenty pounds of additional pull are required for each degree of\r\ngradient. For example, a fore and aft plank road offers a resistance of\r\nabout 60 pounds pull to a ton of load. If this were located on a seven\r\nper cent grade, it would require a 60 pound pull to overcome the load\r\nresistance plus seven times twenty or 140 pounds additional pull for the\r\ngrade, a total of 200 pounds to pull one ton. Dividing 2600, the\r\ndraw-bar pull of the truck, by 200, the resistance offered by road and\r\ngrade, gives 13 tons as the load that can be pulled by the truck over\r\nthis surface and grade. As this must include the weight of the trailer,\r\nwhich when equipped for logging is about three tons, it leaves a total\r\nof 10 tons that the truck can pull. This is equivalent to about 3000\r\nfeet B. M. of Douglas fir logs, the average load that is hauled. While\r\nsuch an adverse grade as cited in this illustration is avoided if\r\npossible with a loaded truck, the illustration will serve to show the\r\npulling capacity of the truck. The hauling of loads of this size would\r\nbe impossible without the use of the trailer. The normal load, then, may\r\nbe increased two, three, or even four times, by the use of the trailer,\r\nover the maximum load that can be carried by the truck alone.\r\n\r\n  [5] Operating Cost of Motor Truck Computed. Timberman. Feb., 1918.\r\n      Page 60.\r\n\r\nObjection to the trailer that it tends to shorten the life of the truck\r\nis hardly worth consideration. According to a careful analysis it has\r\nbeen estimated that the use of the trailer does not shorten the life of\r\nthe truck by more than one year, which is of little consequence when the\r\nsaving due to the size of the load that can be carried is taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n_Description of the Trailer_: The frame of the trailer is constructed of\r\nheavy steel channel bars which support the twin bunks used for logging,\r\nand for the substructure to carry the body when used for other service.\r\nThe steel frame is supported by semi-elliptic springs held by shackles\r\nsimilar to those of the truck. The springs rest securely upon the axle,\r\nare clamped to it by U-bolts, and are relieved from side stresses by\r\nradius rods which connect the axle to the frame.\r\n\r\nThe trailer is coupled to the truck by a reach which is passed through\r\nguides secured to the hounds of the trailer. The latter may slide upon\r\nthe reach and is held in the desired position with reference to the\r\ntruck by means of clamps. The hounds are located fore and aft of the\r\naxle and are connected to it by steel plates. The square reach is more\r\nfavored generally by loggers than the round type for the reason that it\r\ncan be more easily adjusted, particularly the round reach that is cut in\r\nthe woods, which is irregular and has to be clamped very tightly in\r\norder to make it stay in place. Holes bored through the square reach\r\nmakes the adjustment easy. Combination steel and wood reaches, the sides\r\nbeing of channel iron and the center of wood, are favored by some\r\noperators.\r\n\r\nThe twin bunks of the trailer carry the load in balance upon the axle\r\nindependent of the reach, thereby relieving the reach of all vertical\r\nstress. (See illustration below). The rear bunk is just an ordinary\r\nwooden affair designed only to help support the weight of the logs. The\r\nfront bunk is of the same construction as the one on the truck\r\n(described above) and serves to hold the load in place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Type of trailer adapted for heavy Pacific coast logging.]\r\n\r\nThe trailer is guided through the reach directly to the axles, thus\r\nrelieving the springs and frame from side stresses. The springs and\r\ntheir suspension from the frame permit a limited movement of the frame\r\nand the load independent of the wheels and axles and vice versa. This\r\nenables the wheels to pass over an obstruction or drop into a hole\r\nwithout subjecting the trailer to shocks that would otherwise ensue.\r\n\r\nOther types of trailers are used to a limited extent. The trailer\r\ndescribed above was evolved by local engineers and is in almost\r\nuniversal use in motor truck logging operations.\r\n\r\n_Brakes._ All trailers should be equipped with brakes when negotiating\r\nheavy grades. A device connecting the trailer brakes to the truck\r\npermits a ready control from the driver's seat on the truck. The brake\r\noutfit is easily attached to the truck and consists of a ratchet and\r\nlever which winds a one-quarter inch cable on a small drum. The cable\r\nwinds around a second drum which is attached to the frame of the truck\r\nabout six feet back of the driver's seat. A third drum in the center of\r\nthe chassis attached to the shaft of the second drum winds a cable which\r\ngoes to an equalizing bar just in front of the trailer brake. As the\r\nratchet and drum are tightened, the motion is transmitted through the\r\nsecond and third drums to the equalizing bar. Two arms extend from this\r\nbar to roads which when pulled forward, move a bar attached to the road\r\nin such a way that the brake band in the inside of the brake shoe is\r\nextended against the shoe, applying the brakes evenly to each wheel no\r\nmatter how uneven the road-bed or how sharp the curve. A spring attached\r\nto the reach clamp pulls back the equalizing bar when the brakes are\r\nreleased. A heavy spring on the drum in the center of the shaft on the\r\ntruck allows for curves so that an even pressure is always maintained.\r\n\r\nThe use of a trailer equipped with brakes will do away with the numerous\r\ndevices for snubbing a load of logs down a grade not steeper than twelve\r\nper cent. Grades up to this degree of steepness are safe to operate over\r\nin dry weather without added braking power if the trailer is properly\r\nequipped.\r\n\r\nA simple and it is claimed an effective air brake for motor trucks and\r\ntrailers is now being marketed by an air-brake concern of San Francisco\r\nbut it has not yet been tried out in the logging industry. \"Braking\r\naction is secured by means of a diaphragm and pressure plate. The\r\ndiaphragm is directly connected to the brake-band lever. No air\r\ncompressor is used in this system. A small air receiver or storage tank\r\ntakes the spent gases from one of the cylinders by utilizing the outlet\r\nafforded by a priming cock. The brakes are applied by a control system\r\nmounted on the steering column. By means of a quickly adjusted hose\r\nconnection, air can be applied to the wheels of the trailer using the\r\ncontrol which governs the braking of the truck. The air pressure in the\r\nstorage tank is automatically maintained by means of an accumulator\r\nvalve which closes when the tank pressure reaches 150 to 175 pounds. If\r\nthe tank should be empty at the top of a long grade, sufficient pressure\r\nis generated by the compression of the engine to operate the brakes.\r\nOpening the throttle to full emergency position will apply maximum\r\nbraking effect without sliding the wheels.\"[6]\r\n\r\n  [6] Air Brakes for Trucks. Timberman. March, 1920. Page 48g.\r\n\r\nThis system has not been tried out under the conditions as found in the\r\nwoods but if it can be made to work satisfactorily it will be a big\r\nimprovement over the old system as the driver will then have\r\ninstantaneous control over the load at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE AND DEPRECIATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe life of the trailer is about the same as that of the truck, and in\r\ndepreciation, a period of four years is usually allowed. The maintenance\r\nand upkeep of the trailer is very low. It rarely gives out and with the\r\nordinary usage requires only a few minor repairs every two or three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST DATA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe items of expense are here segregated in such a manner that they may\r\nbe used as a basis for figuring the cost of hauling logs under average\r\nconditions. These costs are for the truck and trailer as a unit. If a\r\nroad has to be built, the overhead charge of the road per thousand feet\r\nof timber hauled over it together with the cost of upkeep must be added\r\nto the figures given below in order to know the total cost of\r\ntransportation per thousand feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n3000 FOOT CAPACITY, OUTFIT COMPLETE\r\n\r\nThe following figures are for a 31/2-ton logging truck with a 5-ton\r\ntrailer.

They will vary somewhat with the road conditions, loads,\r\ngrades, and the efficiency of the driver. These variations, however,\r\nwill be slight. They will not amount to more than one cent per thousand\r\nfeet per mile of haul. The investment pays the owner six per cent and\r\nprovides renewals for all time. The interest charge is based on the\r\ntotal cost of the equipment less the cost of the tires. The tire cost is\r\ndeducted in figuring the interest charges because this item is covered\r\nunder running expenses. The resale value of the truck at the end of four\r\nyears is not deducted from the interest charge, because this sum is tied\r\nup for that length of time. Renewal for the equipment is taken care of\r\nby the creation of a sinking fund based on an average life of four\r\nyears. Theoretically, on a 5-ton truck, $1157.13 is put aside each year\r\nfor four years at the expiration of which time the aggregate of these\r\nsavings together with the resale value of $1900, automatically provides\r\nfor the purchase of new equipment.[7]\r\n\r\n  [7] Timberman. Feb., 1918. Page 60.\r\n\r\nA fifty-mile haul may be used as an illustration for figuring the total\r\nrunning expense of the 5-ton truck. This means that the truck makes\r\ntrips enough to total fifty miles for the day's run. The cost per mile,\r\nincluding gasoline, oil and repairs is 26.4 cents. It will, therefore,\r\ncost $13.20 for the fifty miles. To this amount must be added $12.92,\r\ndaily overhead charge, making a total of $26.12 for fifty miles traveled\r\nor 52.2 cents a mile. With an average load of four thousand feet the\r\ncost will be 13.0 cents per mile per thousand feet. A glance at the\r\ntable will show that the greater the mileage and the larger the load,\r\nthe less will be the overhead expense and consequently the cost per mile\r\nper thousand feet. To these items must be added the cost and maintenance\r\nof the road if one has to be built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROAD CONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of the kind of road for hauling logs with the motor truck\r\nis a very important one. It is impossible to move a fifteen-ton load day\r\nin and day out unless there are good roads, and no motor truck operation\r\nof reasonably large proportions can be successfully maintained without a\r\nroad that is well constructed and which will not give way during any\r\nkind of weather, under the loads that are carried. One cannot\r\nsuccessfully and continuously operate on dirt or even gravel roads as\r\nthey are good only when dry. Good roads are as important to the motor\r\ntruck operator as the railroad is to the transportation of logs by rail.\r\n\r\nThe big handicap in motor truck logging in the past has been poor roads.\r\nThe same man who will survey, grade, carefully lay and ballast the steel\r\nfor a logging railroad will many times put a truck and trailer on a poor\r\ndirt road and expect the truck to haul economically and satisfactorily.\r\nA motor truck will haul over some mighty poor apologies for roads but it\r\ndoes not pay. A good road is an excellent investment. It makes larger\r\nloads and more trips a day possible, will save on tires and repairs, and\r\nwill require less gasoline to the mile; the efficiency and output will\r\nbe increased and the time and operating costs will be decreased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sub-grade for motor truck logging road.]\r\n\r\nThere have been some very successful operators who have secured a small\r\nbody of timber at a low price on a public road who made the motor truck\r\npay without building a road. This method of logging in a small way will\r\ncontinue to be carried on by small operators who will haul only during\r\nthree seasons of the year or even less. However, the big future for the\r\nmotor truck for logging is in the larger tracts of timber where it would\r\nnot pay to put in a railroad but where a good type of motor truck road\r\ncan be built cheaply and loads as large as the truck can handle be\r\ncarried with no road restrictions as to the weight.\r\n\r\nIn general four types of roads are used by loggers: (1) the cross-plank\r\nroad, (2) the fore and aft pole road, (3) the fore and aft plank road,\r\nand (4) the cement road. The puncheon road is a modification of the fore\r\nand aft plank road and will be taken up with the latter. The methods and\r\ncost of construction, the advantages and the disadvantages of these\r\nvarious types of roads follow in detail.\r\n\r\n_Sub-Grade_: The sub-grade is put in the same way for each type of road.\r\nThe average width of the truck is seven feet and six inches, calling for\r\na road about eight and a half feet wide, so that the sub-grade should be\r\ntwelve feet in width. An illustration of the amount of grading necessary\r\nis shown on page 25. Too much care cannot be taken in the matter of\r\nditches for draining. In a rainy climate, the water should be carried\r\naway from the hill side of the grade every fifty feet.\r\n\r\n_Cross-Plank Road_: The cross-plank road is constructed by laying cull\r\nties on hewn poles lengthwise of the road. Three rows, four feet apart\r\nare used and second grade ten foot plank, six inches thick and of random\r\nwidths, are securely nailed to the ties. Great care must be taken to\r\nhave the ties laid fairly smooth if the road is to be even. Plank less\r\nthan six inches in thickness should not be used as the thinner ones very\r\nsoon crack and go to piece under the excessive jar and vibration.\r\n\r\nThis is a very expensive road to build as it wastes material. Six\r\nthousand feet of lumber is necessary for every hundred foot station, at\r\na cost of $222 a station for the material alone, without considering the\r\ncost of laying it. The maintenance cost also is very heavy because the\r\nnails pull out as a result of the vibration caused by the truck. This\r\ntype of road is used only over short stretches, such as swampy ground\r\nin connection with the dirt road, and on steep grades and sharp turns in\r\nconnection with the pole or plank road.\r\n\r\nThe Esary Logging Company at Camano Island, Washington, put in a\r\ncross-plank road for a short distance on a sharp curve and a steep\r\ngrade, to see how it would affect the traction. It was found that cross\r\nplanking was not necessary on curves where the grade is ten per cent or\r\nless when coming down with a load, providing trailer brakes are used. In\r\nthe future the company will not use this type of road unless grades\r\nabove this maximum are encountered. It is impossible to lay a\r\ncross-plank road smoothly because the stringers settle and make the road\r\nbumpy. The resulting jar on the equipment and the fact that these\r\nstretches have to be taken at a much reduced speed, furnish ample reason\r\nto condemn its use.\r\n\r\nThe only real use for a cross-plank road is to secure better traction on\r\ngrades exceeding ten or twelve per cent, and then it should be laid with\r\na space of about one inch between the planks. Even in such cases it\r\nwould be better to use some other method for securing traction, such as\r\nsanding the track or winding the drive wheels with a light cable. The\r\nwaste of material and the excessive vibration limit the use of this type\r\nof road.\r\n\r\n_Fore and Aft Pole Road._ In the fore and aft pole road, poles from\r\ntwelve to fourteen inches in diameter are hewn on one or more faces and\r\nlaid longitudinally with the road, with one or more logs for each wheel\r\ntrack. This type of road is commonly used by motor truck loggers and is\r\none that lends itself readily to their use. It is the most practical\r\nroad that can be built unless there is a small saw-mill handy to saw\r\nplanks for the fore and aft plank road. The smaller material growing\r\nalong the right of way is used at an expense of only what it costs to\r\nfell it, hew it and put the poles in place. Hemlock poles may be used to\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nSome operators use the single large pole placed on cross-ties eight or\r\nten feet apart and use lighter eight-inch poles placed on the outside\r\nfor a guard rail to keep the truck from leaving the track. The main pole\r\nis laid in a ditch about eight inches deep, leaving it half buried. This\r\nhelps to keep the poles from spreading and increases their firmness and\r\nstrength. The pole is notched into the cross-ties, which are made of\r\nlogs not less than eight inches in diameter, and is securely nailed or\r\nbolted to prevent it from rolling. The outside guard rail is laid on\r\nthe surface of the ground close to the main track and is securely braced\r\nfrom the outside by means of posts sunk into the ground or it may be\r\nspiked to the main pole or to the ties. When running with the trailer on\r\nthis narrow type of road, the guard rail is very necessary.\r\n\r\nAfter the poles have been laid, the sub-grade should be ditched in the\r\ncenter deep enough to carry away the water that falls in the middle of\r\nthe road. The success of the road depends to a large extent upon good\r\ndrainage.\r\n\r\nThe Meicklejohn and Brown Logging Company near Monroe, Washington,\r\noperate over a pole road with three poles for each wheel. The poles are\r\nfrom ten to twelve inches in diameter at the small end and are hewn to a\r\nsix inch face, giving an eighteen inch bearing surface for each wheel.\r\n(See illustration on page 29.) The minimum sized pole that should be\r\nused for roads of this character is one eight inches in diameter at the\r\nsmall end. The road is constructed the same way as the single pole road\r\nand the poles are laid on cross ties twelve inches in diameter placed\r\nfrom eight to ten feet apart. Where the road is off the ground as when\r\ncrossing over a small depression, these sleepers must not be over five\r\nfeet apart. The guard rails at this operation are held in place by means\r\nof a wooden brace nailed from each end of the rail to a near-by stump.\r\nThe ends of the poles used for the track are adzed so that they match\r\nevenly. By breaking the joints and hewing them the road presents a level\r\nsurface with no bumps.\r\n\r\nIn planning the curves, it is necessary to make the tracks somewhat\r\nwider than on straight stretches in order to keep the trailer from\r\nrunning off. The track should be three feet wide on sharp curves and\r\nprovided with a stout guard rail if there is any danger of the truck\r\nleaving the track. The curves are banked on the opposite side from that\r\nused on railroad curves. That is, the inner rail is raised about three\r\ninches. This is to throw the load to the outside away from the inner\r\nguard rail, making it easier to make the turn without the rear wheels\r\nbinding. In this way a 35 degree curve may be negotiated with forty or\r\nfifty foot logs. As the curves have to be passed at a much reduced\r\nspeed, there is little danger of the logs rolling off due to the raised\r\ninner rail.\r\n\r\nThe grading for a road of this construction is usually light. The grades\r\nshould, if possible, be kept below five per cent. A truck will operate\r\nbetter on a ten per cent grade in dry weather than on a five per cent\r\none in wet weather. On a road of this type, grades up to ten per cent\r\ncan be operated over unless there is snow. When the grades are above\r\nthis and the weather is wet, traction still may be secured by sanding\r\nthe road or by tacking an old half inch steel cable to the road in the\r\nform of a figure \"s\". If this is sanded in addition, the truck may\r\nsafely be taken up a steeper grade than it would be safe to bring it\r\ndown without sanding.\r\n\r\nThe pole road could be greatly improved by hewing the faces of the poles\r\nwhere they come together side by side so that an even fit is made. The\r\ndetails of this improved form of construction are shown in figure 1,\r\npage 30.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The most common type of motor truck logging road--a\r\nfore-and-aft pole road.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1. Cross section of pole road. Scale--1 inch\r\nequals 2 feet.]\r\n\r\nAt the present time this is not done and there are one or more ruts in\r\nthe surface of the road due to the rounding off of the poles where they\r\nare placed side by side. The front wheels of the truck are constantly\r\ndropping into these ruts, tending to spread the track apart and making\r\nit harder for the driver to steer. The tires also suffer from uneven\r\nwear. With this deep groove in the track, a certain amount of the\r\ntraction of the rear wheels is also lost. Hence a much better road would\r\nbe one with the inner faces of the poles hewn so that a tight fit is\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nThis road can be built of two large poles or three smaller ones to give\r\na flat track two and a half feet wide for each wheel. Laid nearly flush\r\nwith the ground the guard rail can be eliminated with this width of\r\ntrack, except on sharp curves and other locations where there would be\r\ndanger if the truck left the track. On such a road the traction will\r\nalso be increased, better time can be made, the truck will be easier to\r\nsteer and hence safer to operate, and there will be less wear on the\r\ntires. Such a road can be very easily and cheaply built by bringing in a\r\nportable sawmill and slabbing the material on two sides to the desired\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe life of a good pole road is from three to four years if kept in good\r\nrepair. The maintenance cost is very light if the road is properly\r\nconstructed in the first place, consisting chiefly in removing a pole\r\nhere and there that shows signs of too much wear, and in bracing guard\r\nrails where they weaken. The use of two or three hewn poles laid\r\nlengthwise for each wheel without cross-ties does not pay as the poles\r\nsoon get out of place even when trenched, and the loss of traction due\r\nto the irregularities and of time and money in the upkeep of such a road\r\nmore than justifies putting in a good road in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe cost of a fore and aft pole road varies with the accessibility of\r\nthe material and the cost of the labor. In the past they have been built\r\nfor as low as $2000 a mile, but with the present prices costs will range\r\nfrom $5000 to $7000 a mile. One company within the year contracted the\r\ngrading and construction of the road for $70 a hundred foot station, not\r\nincluding the cost of clearing and chunking out the right of way. The\r\ntotal cost was about $125 a station or $6600 a mile.\r\n\r\nSome of the advantages of the pole road are that it is tough and strong\r\nand does not crack, split or break easily so that if it is properly put\r\nin it lasts and requires but little maintenance. The material for its\r\nconstruction is found along the right of way and being small in diameter\r\nis less expensive than other road materials.\r\n\r\n_Fore and Aft Plank Roads._ This type of road is constructed by placing\r\ncross-ties from eight to ten feet apart, center to center, upon which\r\nare placed lengthwise for each wheel, two or three sawed timbers not\r\nless than six inches in thickness and from twelve to fifteen inches in\r\nwidth. A good road of this type will deliver 150 million feet of logs at\r\na conservative estimate.\r\n\r\nThe grading is usually light and in many places entirely unnecessary.\r\nSecond-grade six by eight ties with the eight inch face placed down, or\r\nhewn poles are laid about eight feet apart. Where the road bed is soft,\r\nthe ties are placed closer and in some places as near as two and a half\r\nfeet apart. Over very swampy ground, the road known as the fore and aft\r\npuncheon road is used. It consists simply of cedar puncheon placed\r\ncrosswise of the road with the usual planking nailed securely to it. The\r\nplank used should never be less than six inches in thickness in the main\r\nroad as it has been proved that four inch plank very soon give way under\r\nthe heavy loads. On the spur lines it is practicable to use four inch\r\nplank because the road is used only a short time.\r\n\r\nThe total width of the road is eight feet and the plank are laid on top\r\nof the ground, but if they are sunk nearly to the level of the ground\r\nthe road is made considerably more firm and enduring, and of course is\r\nsafer. The ends are adzed smooth to present an even surface,\r\ndrift-bolted to the ties, and all joints broken.\r\n\r\nThe plank in the track are kept together by means of a three by four\r\ninch timber driven tightly between the tracks on top of the cross-ties\r\nat each joint, and a block nailed to the outside of the tie at each\r\njoint with a wedge-shaped piece of wood driven between it and the plank.\r\n(See illustration on page 33.) This wedge is driven in from time to time\r\nas occasion may demand. If, in addition to this construction, dirt or\r\ngravel is filled in the center to the level of the track, the road is\r\nmade very solid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fore-and-aft plank road with wedges on cross ties to\r\nfacilitate the re-aligning of the planks.]\r\n\r\nWith a good road of this type and a bearing surface of thirty inches,\r\nthe trouble and expense of a guard rail may be eliminated. When a light\r\ntruck is used for a small body of timber such a wide and heavily\r\nconstructed road is not practical. In this case, a four inch plank with\r\na fifteen inch surface and an eight inch pole for a guard rail would be\r\nused. Here again the track must be made wider on the sharp curves, often\r\nas wide as three and a half feet. Usually, the inner rail is made wider\r\nthan the outer one. On very sharp curves the track may have to be\r\nplanked solid to keep the trailer from running off. By sawing out chips\r\nfrom one-half to one inch wide two-thirds of the way through the plank,\r\nand about six feet apart on the inner side, a long plank may be bent\r\naround quite a sharp curve. The ties, of course, should be placed so as\r\nto allow the cut sections of the plank to rest squarely on them. This\r\ndoes away with the short pieces and so strengthens the track.\r\n\r\nThe company logging at Camano Island, Washington, operates over a road\r\nof this type, an illustration of which is shown on page 38. The\r\ndifficulties encountered in the construction of this particular road\r\nwere very considerable as a cut through very hard shale, in some places\r\nas much as seven feet, was necessary. The maintenance on this road is\r\nheavier than is usual. Two men are employed to work on it continually.\r\nThe work consists of blocking up the loose ties and plank, making any\r\nnecessary repairs and keeping sand and gravel on the steep grades. The\r\ncost of this work is good insurance as it keeps the road in the best of\r\ncondition at all times and saves on other operating expenses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detailed view of fore-and-aft plank road, showing method\r\nof wedging.]\r\n\r\n_Cost._ The first cost of a road of this type is high but it more than\r\npays in the long run if a large body of timber is to be hauled over it.\r\nThe timber used in its construction amounts to about 160 thousand feet\r\nper mile. Second grade material can be used at a cost of approximately\r\n$5,500 a mile for the plank. The total cost per mile varies from $6,000\r\nto $8,000. The plank road at Camano Island cost $20,000 for two and\r\nthree-quarter miles, which includes the cost of the plank, the grading\r\nand labor of putting the plank in place. This is at the rate of about\r\n$7,275 a mile, or approximately $138 a hundred foot station. The\r\noverhead charge for the road at this operation is $.75 a thousand feet\r\nof timber hauled over it. Plank roads of lighter construction have been\r\nbuilt for $4,000 a mile. The length of life is about the same as that of\r\na pole road, three to four years.\r\n\r\nThe fore and aft plank road is one of the best roads that can be put in\r\nwhere the timber is of sufficient quantity to justify the expense. The\r\nbig advantage is the speed that can be made and the saving in the\r\nequipment. Such a road is very free from bumps and the jar and vibration\r\non the truck is no greater than on a city pavement. The depreciation on\r\na truck depends to a great extent upon the road operated over. With the\r\nabove type, depreciation on the truck will not be less than five years.\r\nIn addition, tire mileage will be double that obtained over a pole road,\r\nand the gasoline and repair expense will be very materially cut. Owing\r\nto the very small vibration, a load of logs can be brought to the\r\nlanding as fast as it is safe to let the truck glide on a down grade.\r\nSpeeds as high as 20 miles an hour can easily be taken without excessive\r\nvibration. The traction is greater on this type of road than it is on\r\nthe pole road, due to the greater bearing surface. Traction on grades up\r\nto 12% is easily secured by sanding the plank.\r\n\r\n_Concrete Roads._ Concrete has been suggested as an ideal road material.\r\nHowever, up to the present time, loggers have not been very enthusiastic\r\nabout this type of road on account of the cost of construction, which is\r\nsomewhat more expensive than the other types of roads, and on account of\r\nthe permanence of the finished road which is beyond that needed. To the\r\nwriter's knowledge, there is no company operating in the Northwest over\r\na concrete road of their own building. In the future such roads may be\r\nused to a limited extent on the main haul by companies which have\r\noperations extending over at least a five year period. The spur roads\r\nwill probably always be of some other material.\r\n\r\nIn building such roads two tracks of concrete, one for each wheel are\r\nprovided. The sub-grade should be well ditched in the center with cross\r\nditches every fifty feet, as is done with the pole road. It has been\r\nsuggested that the ditches holding the track be six inches deep and\r\ntwenty-six inches wide. They are filled to the top with concrete and\r\nbuilt with a lip four inches high and four inches wide along the outside\r\non top of the main surface to serve as a guard rail. No forms are\r\nnecessary except for the guard lip.\r\n\r\nA word of caution here may not be amiss. Concrete roads of this nature\r\nmust be regarded as only experimental, for no specific data are\r\navailable for determining the proper section of concrete to be used for\r\ncarrying heavy loads on so narrow a bearing surface. It is evident that\r\nthe carrying capacity of such strips of concrete would be greatly\r\naffected by the character of the sub-base. It will therefore be\r\nimpossible to specify a standard that can be used under all conditions.\r\n\r\nThe use of the concrete guard rail is one of the disadvantages of this\r\nroad. The edges of the rail cannot be made rounding except by special\r\nforms and the rubbing of the tires against this rough surface would\r\ngreatly reduce the tire mileage. In addition, the rail is so exposed to\r\nweather and hard wear that it cannot be relied upon to serve effectively\r\nfor any great length of time. The placing of forms is also a\r\nconsiderable item of expense in building such a road. A method which\r\nwould eliminate such an expense and at the same time provide a more\r\npractical rail would be an advantage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2. Cross section of concrete road. Scale--1 inch\r\nequals 2 feet.]\r\n\r\nIt has already been said that guard rails are unnecessary with a thirty\r\ninch track except on sharp curves and otherwise dangerous places.\r\nHowever, where rails are necessary the wooden rail fastened by bolts\r\nembedded in the concrete as illustrated above, is quite effective and\r\nreadily installed. This consists of a four by six inch plank placed on\r\nedge and drift-bolted to the concrete every three to five feet by a\r\nthree-quarter inch bolt. These bolts are placed in the concrete when it\r\nis poured and should be embedded six inches. This will provide a rail\r\nless expensive to build than a concrete rail and one which will last\r\nlonger and save on tires. Replacements are easily made by removing the\r\nnuts and placing a new plank in place of the old. With a guard rail of\r\nthis type, there is left a twenty-six inch track for the wheels to run\r\nin.\r\n\r\nExperiments by W. D. Pence (Journ. West. Soc. Eng. Vol. VI, 1901, Page\r\n549) on 1:2:4 concrete give an average value of 0.0000055 inches per\r\ndegree Fahrenheit for the coefficient of expansion. The richer the\r\nconcrete, the greater the change in dimension. Due to the expansion, in\r\nlaying the concrete the track must be broken every twenty-five or thirty\r\nfeet by placing a half-inch board in the ditch when the concrete is\r\nbeing filled in. Later this board is removed and the joint filled with\r\nasphalt so that the concrete may expand without danger of cracking the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n_Cost._ The best mix to use in building this road is what is known as\r\nthe 1:21/2:5. For one cubic yard of concrete, the following amounts of\r\nmaterials will be used for the above mix: 1.21 barrels of cement, 0.46\r\ncubic yards of sand, and 0.92 cubic yards of stone. At the present\r\nprices, the cost for the materials for this road is about twenty cents a\r\ncubic foot or about $4,400 a mile. The total cost of the road including\r\nthe necessary grading, ditching and labor, will be from $7,000 to $9,000\r\nper mile.\r\n\r\nOne of the big advantages of the concrete road is the large gain in\r\ntraction secured when operating on steep grades. A motor truck will haul\r\nup a twelve per cent and down a fifteen per cent grade in wet weather on\r\nconcrete due to the roughened surface on which the tires do not easily\r\nslip. This, of course, would be dangerous to attempt on the other types\r\nof roads. Another advantage is the small item of upkeep necessary. A\r\nroad well laid in the first place should need no repair except to\r\nreplace worn guard rails as they show signs of weakening. The concrete\r\nroad, however, will not be generally used except on the mainline by the\r\nlarger concerns, or for short distances on steep grades where greater\r\ntraction is desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIDGES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn most cases the construction of bridges is unnecessary on account of\r\nthe steep grades the trucks can take and because they can negotiate\r\nsharp curves, which make it easier to avoid expensive bridge work.\r\nWhere they are absolutely necessary a serviceable bridge is made of\r\ncribwork.\r\n\r\nThe Esary Logging Company of Camano Island, Washington, operates over a\r\ncrib bridge 175 feet long and 15 feet high. The sub-structure of this\r\nbridge is made of logs laid alternately crosswise in tiers. Six by\r\ntwelve inch plank are laid diagonally on the cribbing and four by twelve\r\ninch plank are placed on crosswise to the road on top. This makes a\r\nbumpy surface. A better one could be made with cross-ties placed on the\r\ncribbing with fore and aft planking on top. A guard rail is placed on\r\nall bridges.\r\n\r\nShort bridges up to eighty or ninety feet in length are constructed by\r\nthe use of two large logs hewn flat on the upper surface. The logs\r\nshould be at least thirty-six inches in diameter and perfectly sound.\r\nThey are placed at the proper gauge and the regular road on cross-ties\r\nconstructed on top. On such short stretches this type of bridge has been\r\noperated over without supports. It is not used, however, for long\r\nstretches. The long bridges are, of course, constructed of bents or\r\npiling but are very seldom used in connection with motor truck\r\ntransportation on account of the expensive construction and because they\r\nare usually unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTURNING DEVICES AND TURNOUTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the truck and trailer reach the place where they are to be loaded,\r\nsome method must be used to turn them around. Various means are used to\r\naccomplish this. One is the motor truck turn-table. The turn-table\r\nshould be slightly longer than the length of the truck and trailer\r\ncombined. It is constructed of heavy plank and timbers so that each\r\ntrack is about 16 inches wide and tapers in thickness from about 14\r\ninches at the center to 4 inches at the ends. The two tracks are held\r\ntogether at the center and each end by heavy timbers. A heavy timber is\r\nsunk to the level of the road and at the center two circular saws are\r\nlaid. A king bolt through the center brace of the turn-table and through\r\nthe two saws into the sunken timber provides a pivot upon which the\r\ntable turns. When properly balanced and with a little oil between the\r\nsurfaces of the saws, the turn-table can be operated by hand with very\r\nlittle effort. It is usually placed at the end of the road. A turn-table\r\ncan be loaded on the truck and trailer when it is desired to move it, so\r\nthat as the road is extended into the timber, a means of turning the\r\ntruck can be obtained close to the point where the logs are to be\r\nloaded. This device can be built at a cost of from $75 to $125 and is\r\nvery serviceable. The main objection to its use is that the setting has\r\nto be just right to make it work satisfactorily and it is sometimes\r\ndifficult to get a spot that is level enough. It is always a difficult\r\nproblem and a different one for each set-up.\r\n\r\nThe use of the \"back around\" is more common with truck loggers at\r\npresent because it is easier to build. The back-around is simply a\r\npocket or short spur along the road above the landing ground which is\r\nplanked solid. The truck and trailer are backed into this far enough so\r\nthat the truck can pull ahead in the opposite direction. This method of\r\nturning the truck requires only a little extra clearing and grading and\r\nis less expensive and more easily constructed than a turn-table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Turn out on fore-and-aft plank road.]\r\n\r\nWhen two or more truck units are to be used on a single track, a careful\r\ncalculation must be made to determine the best passing places. The\r\nlocation of these points may determine the success of the operation.\r\nThey should be placed so that the truck returning empty can reach the\r\nturnout before the loaded one comes along in order that the loaded one\r\nmay not be held up. At the same time, the turnout should not be so far\r\naway from the loading ground that the loading crew will be idle for any\r\nlength of time while waiting for an empty truck. It is better to have an\r\nextra turnout, even if seldom used, than conditions that would hinder\r\nefficient operation or might even result in a collision which would tie\r\nup the logging for several days.\r\n\r\nA few loggers build a turnout of the same material as the main road for\r\na short distance to the side. An illustration of this type of turnout is\r\nshown above. Most of them, however, simply clear off a right of way and\r\nput in a gravel bottom for the road as the waiting truck at this point\r\nis empty and will not ordinarily sink into the ground and get stalled. A\r\nfew heavy planks laid fore and aft in the form of a track are sometimes\r\nused. The construction of passing places is very simple--the only\r\nimportant thing to be taken into consideration is the proper point at\r\nwhich the trucks should pass in order to keep the operation going at\r\nmaximum efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEPHONES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn connection with the passing places, the installation of a telephone\r\nline is an important but often neglected item. With two or more\r\ntransportation units, a telephone line is a handy if not well nigh\r\nindispensable accessory. It is a great advantage to have such a system\r\nwith stations at each end of the road and also at the passing places, as\r\nunavoidable delays will frequently allow a waiting truck to move on to\r\nanother passing place, thus saving time. To avoid accidents, the driver\r\nat the passing place should call the loader at the spar tree to see if\r\nthe road is clear before coming any farther.\r\n\r\nVery often something breaks on the yarding or loading donkey. With the\r\ntelephone, perhaps a half day of shutdown may be saved by calling the\r\nmain camp for the repair parts and having them brought up by the next\r\ntruck. The saving due to avoided accidents and the saving of time more\r\nthan pays for the initial expense of installation. The telephone line\r\nshould not be neglected at the larger operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCLINES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn rough country the use of the incline has been a great help and has\r\nproved to be entirely practical and quite economical. Grades as high as\r\nsixty or even seventy per cent can be safely taken with an incline if\r\nthe proper measures are taken to prevent accidents.\r\n\r\nA typical incline is successfully operated by the Meickeljohn, Brown\r\nLogging Company near Monroe, Washington. It is fifteen hundred feet long\r\nand the steepest grade is twenty-eight per cent. An 11-in. x 14-in.\r\nroader donkey located at the top of the incline snubs the loads down and\r\nhauls up the empty trucks. A one and one-eighth inch wire cable is\r\nthrown around the logs and made fast by means of a clevis. This holds\r\nthe truck and prevents the logs from slipping forward and injuring the\r\ndriver. On all inclines, the line should be choked around the logs\r\nrather than simply attached to the truck to prevent them from slipping\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nThe snubbing device consists of an ordinary donkey engine fitted with a\r\nhand brake of extra large size and special air valves so that air is\r\nsucked into the cylinders and let out of the exhaust when the engine is\r\nbeing pulled backwards by the weight of the load. The load is controlled\r\nby the amount of air let out of the valves. The braking action is very\r\npositive and the load can be stopped in a few revolutions of the crank\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\nThe average time to lower the load down the incline is three and a half\r\nminutes. At the bottom of the incline, the cable is released and the\r\ntruck goes on its way. The cable is attached to the waiting truck by\r\nmeans of a ring fastened to the frame and the donkey pulls the empty\r\ntruck to the top. The time taken to raise the trucks is three minutes.\r\n\r\nOn grades too steep to operate a truck safely with the ordinary brakes\r\nand yet not steep enough to warrant the expense of the donkey snubber,\r\nthe difficulty is overcome by means of a friction snubber. This consists\r\nsimply of a cable which is hooked to the truck and extends through a\r\nsystem of three or four pulleys and thence on down the track. The\r\nfriction of this line dragging on the ground and passing through the\r\npulleys is enough to hold the load so that the truck engine must exert\r\npower to pull the load down the grade. The line is made long enough so\r\nthat as the load reaches the bottom of the grade, the free end of the\r\ncable has been pulled up to the system of pulleys and is ready to be\r\nattached to the next load. This system is efficient for small grades, is\r\ninexpensive to install, and requires no further attention.\r\n\r\nBy the use of the incline with the donkey engine snubber, very heavy\r\ngrades can be taken. The construction of the incline is the same as the\r\nrest of the road and is only slightly more expensive to build because of\r\nthe inconvenience of laying it on such a steep slope. The use of the\r\nincline will not slow up the operation to any great extent as from fifty\r\nto seventy thousand feet of logs (which is about the average yarding and\r\nloading capacity of one motor-truck side), can be taken over it in a\r\nday. This method of hauling down steep grades is used in several\r\noperations and has been found to be entirely successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYARDING\r\n\r\n\r\nA variety of methods are used by motor truck loggers to get the logs to\r\nthe landing to be loaded. The larger operations invariably use the\r\nhigh-lead method of yarding as the logs come in quicker and with fewer\r\nhang-ups. In a few places the old ground method of yarding with a bull\r\nblock is still used. The horse team and skid road is used in a small\r\ntimber where poles and piling are being marketed. The latter is a slow\r\nmethod but will keep one truck busy and is still used in some places\r\nwhere small stands are located along the highway or in other readily\r\naccessible places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOADING AND UNLOADING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loading of a motor truck is very much the same proposition as the\r\nloading of a flat-car. The principal difficulties that trucks have had\r\nto contend with have been poor roads and inefficient methods of loading.\r\nIn loading, the main trouble has been in regulating the yarding so that\r\na supply of logs is always on hand. The use of the gin pole and crotch\r\nline operated by the straw drum of the yarding donkey ties up the\r\nyarding until the truck is loaded. This is being overcome by using a\r\nseparate engine with the high lead for yarding and doing the logging\r\nindependently of the yarding as is done in the case of railroad logging.\r\nIn this way the yarder can keep ahead of the loading engine and there\r\nwill be no delay at the landing.\r\n\r\nMost of the larger companies load with the Duplex loader and use tongs.\r\nThis is a safer way to load than with the crotch line as the logs can be\r\nmore easily controlled. The danger of dropping a log through the truck\r\nor of knocking off the top of the truck or the driver's seat is greatly\r\nlessened.\r\n\r\nIn pole and piling timber where a skid road and horses are used, loading\r\nis done by hand or with a team. A landing is built of cribwork and the\r\nlogs are simply rolled on the truck with peavies or cant hooks, or a\r\nparbuckle system with skids and horses is used. This works fairly well\r\nfor small operations in small timber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Loading a motor truck and trailer through the use of a\r\nboom.]\r\n\r\nThe latest development in loading is the boom. An illustration of this\r\nmethod is shown above. The boom itself is a fifty to sixty foot pole\r\nabout eighteen inches in diameter at the base and is attached to the\r\nspar tree by means of a metal strap with two lugs which are fitted into\r\nholes bored in the spar to keep the strap from slipping. The base of the\r\nboom is fitted with a metal joint which moves freely on an upright pin\r\nset in the metal strap. (See A, above.) The whole rig is set high enough\r\non the tree so that it may be swung in a semi-circle and clear the\r\nloaded truck by several feet. A light line (B) from the haulback drum of\r\nthe donkey passes through a block attached low on the spar tree and\r\nthence to another block on a stump to the right of the landing. From\r\nhere it passes through a third block at the end of the boom and back to\r\nthe stump again. This secures the needed pulling power from the haulback\r\ndrum.\r\n\r\nThe lifting line from the mainline drum passes through a block half way\r\nup the tree and thence through a free swinging block (C) and back to the\r\ntree again. On the second block is a ring to which two one inch lines\r\n(D) are attached. These lines pass through the boom stick on rollers (E)\r\nabout fifteen feet apart. On the ends of these lines hooks are attached.\r\nThese two lines should be so arranged that the hooks remain parallel to\r\nthe ground. Two three-quarters inch cables (F) with an eye splice in\r\neach end are attached to the hooks. These lines, or chokers, are then\r\nwrapped around the log and it is lifted clear of the ground by means of\r\nthe block hold in the main line.\r\n\r\nThe haulback line (B) from the donkey is slacked and the boom travels\r\nover to the truck by means of a line (G) attached from the boom to a\r\ndummy log running on a special guy line. A log two feet in diameter and\r\nsixteen feet long is wrapped at each end with a cable and fastened to a\r\npulley. The two pulleys and attached dummy log travel up and down the\r\nguy line as the boom moves. A line is attached to the boom and runs\r\nthrough a pulley attached to the dummy log and extends back to the boom\r\nagain. This pulls the boom over above the truck as the dummy log travels\r\ndown the guy line. The logs are held parallel to the ground above the\r\ntruck and the truck is run under the boom to the location designated by\r\nthe head loader. With this system the logs will not drop suddenly on the\r\ntrucks as the log will fall off while being carried over to the truck if\r\nthere is any danger of its falling at all. After the log is placed, the\r\nboom is pulled back to the landing by the haulback line. This system has\r\nworked with success in a number of motor truck operations and is a safer\r\nmethod than loading with tongs because the logs cannot accidentally drop\r\nand injure the truck. However, the loading situation should be studied\r\ncarefully. The most efficient loading device for the particular needs of\r\nthe operation may be installed as any loss of time in loading seriously\r\naffects the output of the operation.\r\n\r\nMost of the truck loggers unload their logs into water; either into a\r\nlake, a river that can be driven, or into tide-water. A few, however,\r\nunload directly into the log pond at the mill or at the log yard in case\r\nthe mill has no log pond.\r\n\r\nThe road is usually planked solid at the unloading ground. A great help\r\nin unloading is a dock from six to twelve inches higher on one side\r\nthan on the other so the logs will roll off the truck easily. The\r\nbrow-skid should be close to the log bunks and just a little lower than\r\nthese when the truck is tilted. When unloading into shallow water, such\r\nas a small river, six or eight skids a foot and a half in diameter are\r\nplaced so that they slope from the brow-skid to the water at an angle of\r\nforty-five degrees. An illustration of this method of unloading is shown\r\nbelow. The skids are so placed that the unloading ground will not be\r\nundermined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Unloading truck and trailer through the use of an\r\nincline, showing brow-skids and roll-way.]\r\n\r\nWhen the truck comes to a stop on the incline, the chock blocks are\r\nreleased from the opposite side and the logs roll off of their own\r\naccord. In some instances a gill-poke has been used in connection with\r\nthe unloading incline, the logs being sheared off as the truck moves\r\nahead. Usually the logs roll off readily without the use of the\r\ngill-poke and if a load does stick it can be loosened with a cant-hook,\r\nso that the gill-poke really is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nUnloading on public wharves or roads where no permanent incline can be\r\nused is accomplished by placing a portable wedge-shaped timber in front\r\nof the outside truck and trailer wheels and driving upon it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Parbuckling a load of logs from the truck and trailer.]\r\n\r\nIn the most efficient way of unloading the usual brow-skid is placed a\r\nfew inches below the log bunk and the logs are parbuckled from the truck\r\nand trailer, an illustration of which is shown above. The trucks are run\r\non an incline so that one side is raised about four inches. A\r\ncrotch-line consisting of two half-inch cables is attached to the\r\nbrow-skid and passed under the logs to a ring fastened to an inch cable.\r\nThe larger cable passes thru a block located on a gin pole. A light\r\nyarding or a land clearing donkey furnishes the power to parbuckle the\r\nlogs into the water. By this method the logs are lifted from the truck\r\nas they are rolled into the water with little danger of the top log\r\ndropping on the log bunk as is often the case when other methods are\r\nused, resulting in expensive repairs for broken springs or bearings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME STUDIES\r\n\r\n\r\nTime is a very important item in loading and unloading. Usually the most\r\ntime is consumed in loading, for which reason any improvement that will\r\nreduce the time taken to load will greatly increase the efficiency of\r\nthe operation. With the proper unloading devices, the truck may be\r\nunloaded in the time required to knock down the chock blocks.\r\n\r\nThe following table is a record kept for one day of the actual time\r\ntaken by a truck at each step in the hauling of logs at one operation.\r\nHowever, it is possible to give only arbitrary figures to fit the\r\nparticular operation of which they are taken. No average figures can be\r\ngiven that fit all conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n           DONKEY ENGINE                     DUMP AT MILL\r\n          Time            Time          Unload-          Time\r\n  Arrive Loading  Leave   Down   Arrive   ing    Leave    Up    Scale\r\n  A.M.\r\n   7:15  10 Min.   7:25  20 Min.  7:45  25 Min.   8:10  20 Min.  2592\r\n   8:30   5 Min.   8:35  27 Min.  8:57  13 Min.   9:10  20 Min.  2092\r\n   9:30  12 Min.   9:42  21 Min. 10:03   7 Min.  10:10  20 Min.  1908\r\n  10:30  12 Min.  10:42  33 Min. 11:15  30 Min.  11:45  20 Min.  3074\r\n  P.M.\r\n  12:05  10 Min.  12:15  35 Min. 12:50  17 Min.   1:07  20 Min.  2542\r\n   1:27  15 Min.   1:42  18 Min.  2:00  27 Min.   2:27  20 Min.  1828\r\n   2:47   8 Min.   2:55  21 Min.  3:16   8 Min.   3:24  20 Min.  1689\r\n   3:44  11 Min.   3:55  23 Min.  4:18   9 Min.   4:27  20 Min.  2407\r\n   4:47  14 Min.   5:01  26 Min.  5:27  12 Min.   5:39  20 Min.  2558\r\n                                                                -----\r\n                                               Total            20690\r\n\r\n\r\nLength of haul 5.9 miles round trip.\r\n\r\nAmount of gasoline, 15 gallons.\r\n\r\nThe above figures were taken several years ago when the facilities for\r\nunloading were slower than the present day methods, which accounts for\r\nthe excessive length of time taken to unload.[8]\r\n\r\n  [8] The writer is indebted to Mr. George Gunn, Jr., for these figures.\r\n\r\nThe unloading of a truck is a time when a little care taken will save\r\nconsiderable expense for repairs. Such a method as the parbuckling\r\nsystem should be used by companies with sufficient stumpage to warrant\r\nthe expense of the extra donkey, to prevent the top logs from dropping\r\nto the log bunks, thereby saving the cost of repairing broken springs\r\nand bearings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nAt present, the possibilities for the use of the motor truck for logging\r\nare just beginning to be realized. What effect their use will have upon\r\nthe future methods of logging remains to be seen. It is certain,\r\nhowever, that the advent of motor truck transportation will have a\r\nmarked effect upon the science of forestry and will bring about a closer\r\nutilization of our timber resources.\r\n\r\nThe motor truck and the portable band mill seem likely to furnish a\r\ncombination which will do away with the old wasteful circular mill\r\nbecause it supplies the cheapness and efficiency of railroad\r\ntransportation and is applicable to small and scattered tracts and to\r\nstands of low-grade lumber. The fact that the portable band mill may be\r\nmoved for a cut of a million feet assures adaptability. This is not only\r\nan industrial advance but also a silvicultural advance in that it\r\naffords the possibility of cuttings at frequent intervals without\r\ngreatly adding to the cost.\r\n\r\nA closer utilization of our present stands of timber may be practiced by\r\nthe use of the motor truck. In the northwest, only the larger material\r\nis taken from the forest, leaving a large amount of good timber on the\r\nground in the form of poles and piling and chunks too short to be made\r\ninto saw lumber but from which high grade ties can be made. The truck,\r\nin connection with a band mill, will furnish a means of utilizing this\r\npresent waste at a profit to the operator.\r\n\r\nThe motor truck will be a valuable aid in the working out of a sound\r\nnational forest policy for the proper use of our timber resources so\r\nthat the timber will be utilized to the greatest possible extent and at\r\nthe same time methods taken to provide for the perpetuation of the\r\nforest for future generations. This suggests a way of opening the timber\r\nfor the market on some of our national forests. Most of the government\r\nowned forests are situated in more or less rugged country back from the\r\nregular routes of travel. The timber on a great many of these forests is\r\nover-mature and should be cut but at this time it is inaccessible. The\r\nproblem confronting the country is how to make it accessible.\r\n\r\nThe plan for opening these forests is to build permanent concrete or\r\nasphalt roads from the nearest commercial centers thru these tracts\r\ntaking into consideration the aesthetic value of the location as well as\r\nthe possibilities of logging the timber from them. The timber, then, is\r\nto be taken out, under some silvicultural system and under government\r\nsupervision, by motor truck operators who build their own roads from the\r\nnearest concrete road to the timber to be cut. Under this system of\r\nmanagement, the state and federal government pays a part of the expense\r\nof building the permanent road and the operator pays a small sum for the\r\nuse of the road by being taxed additional stumpage.\r\n\r\nThe system of management has many advantages. In the first place, the\r\nmature timber will be logged, the older decadent material coming out\r\nfirst, in small bodies and at the same time care being taken to\r\nreproduce a new stand. The total area is divided so that as the timber\r\nis logged in rotation a continuous cutting will be assured. Due to the\r\nuse of the trucks and on account of the timber being cut in rotation,\r\nthe fire danger will be greatly lessened. In case a fire gets beyond\r\ncontrol, the roads thru the forest make an excellent way to bring in men\r\nand supplies to fight the fire. In this way, a fire is readily\r\naccessible in a few hours where formerly it took perhaps several days to\r\norganize the fire fighting party and reach the scene of action. The\r\nconcrete roads themselves make good fire lines. By means of the good\r\nroads, the forest is opened to campers and tourists each of whom pays a\r\nsmall sum as they enter the forest to help pay for the cost of building\r\nthe roads and to provide funds for more extensive highways. In this way\r\nthe forest is opened for the timber, the best methods of utilization and\r\nforest regeneration are practiced, fire hazard is reduced, and the area\r\nis opened as a recreational ground so that the greatest possible value\r\nis obtained from the tract.\r\n\r\nA great many other uses of the motor truck for logging and scientific\r\nforest utilization are being recognized, as example, for transporting\r\npulpwood, veneer stock, cordwood, rosin and turpentine, and other forest\r\nproducts. Suffice it to say that this method of transportation has\r\nfound a place in the industry and is here to stay. Its value has been\r\nrecognized beyond doubt and in the future will play an important part\r\nin the further development of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n  1916.
