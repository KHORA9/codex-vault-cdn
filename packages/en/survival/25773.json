That there have been portraits taken of _some_ of those\r\nsixty-nine English writers, whose names first occur in the following\r\npages, there can be no doubt; and those portraits may yet be with their\r\nsurviving relatives or descendants. I am not so presumptuous as to apply\r\nto the following most slight memorials, some of which relate to very\r\nobscure persons, who claimed neither \"the boast of heraldry, nor the\r\npomp of power,\" but whose\r\n\r\n                     ----useful toil,\r\n   Their homely joys and destiny obscure\r\n\r\nbenefited society by their honest labour;--I am not so vain as to apply\r\nto these, any part of the high testimony which Sir Walter Scott has so\r\njustly paid to the merit of Mr. Lodge's truly splendid work of the\r\nportraits of celebrated personages of English history. I can only take\r\nleave to disjoint, or to dislocate, or copy, a very few of his words,\r\nand to apply them to the following scanty pages, as it must be\r\ninteresting to have exhibited before our eyes _our fathers as they\r\nlived_, accompanied with such memorials of their lives and characters,\r\nas enable us to compare their persons and countenances with their\r\nsentiments:--portraits shewing us how \"our ancestors looked, moved, and\r\ndressed,\"--as the pen informs us \"how they thought, acted, lived and\r\ndied.\" One cannot help feeling kindness for the memories of those whose\r\nwritings have pleased us.[1]\r\n\r\nWhat native of the county of Hereford, but must wish to see their\r\ntown-hall ornamented with a life-breathing portrait of Dr. Beale,\r\nembodying, as it were, in the resemblance of the individual, (to use\r\nthe words of a most eloquent person on another occasion), \"his spirit,\r\nhis feelings, and his character?\" Or what elegant scholar but must wish\r\nto view the resemblance of the almost unknown Thomas Whately, Esq., or\r\nthat of the Rev. William Gilpin, whose vivid pen (like that of the late\r\nSir Uvedale Price), has \"realized painting,\" and enchained his readers\r\nto the rich scenes of nature?\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson calls portrait painting \"that art which is employed in\r\ndiffusing friendship, in reviving tenderness, in quickening the\r\naffections of the absent, and continuing the presence of the dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe horticultural intercourse that now passes between England and\r\nFrance, induces one to express a wish, that the portraits of many of\r\nthose delightful writers on this science, whose pens have adorned\r\nFrance, (justly termed from its climate _la terre classique\r\nd'horticulture_), were selected and engraved; for many of their\r\nportraits have never yet been engraved. If this selection were\r\naccompanied with a few brief notices of them and their works, it would\r\ninduce many in this country to peruse some of the most fascinating\r\nproductions that ever issued from the press. Amongst so many, whose\r\nportraits and memoirs would interest us, I will mention those of\r\nChampier, who distinguished himself at the battle of Aignadel, and who\r\npublished at Lyons, in 1533, Campus Elisius Galliae amenitate referens;\r\nCharles Etienne, who, in 1529, produced his Praedium Rusticum; and who\r\nwith Leibault published the Maison Rustique, of which upwards of thirty\r\neditions have been published, (and which our Gervase Markham calls _a\r\nwork of infinite excellencie_); Paulmier de Grenlemesnil, a most\r\nestimable man, physician to Charles IX., and who died at Caen in 1588,\r\nand wrote a treatise de Vino et Pomaceo; and the only act of whose long\r\nlife that one regrets is, that his great skill was the means of\r\nre-establishing the health of Charles, who, with his mother, directed\r\nthe horrid Massacre of St. Bartholomew; Cousin, who died in the prison\r\nof Besancon, and wrote De Hortorum laudibus; that patriarch of\r\nagriculture and of horticulture, Olivier de Serres, whose sage and\r\nphilosophic mind composed a work rich with the most profound\r\nreflections, and whose genius and merit were so warmly patronized by\r\n\"le bon Henri,\" and no less by Sully;[2] Boyceau, intendant of the\r\ngardens of Louis XIII., who, in 1638, published Traite du Jardinage,\r\nselon les raisons de la nature, et de l'art, avec divers desseins de\r\nparterres, pelouses, bosquets, &c.; Andre Mollet, who wrote Le Jardin de\r\nplaisir, &c.; Claude Mollet, head gardener to Henry IV. and Louis XIII.,\r\nwho, in 1595, planted the gardens of Saint Germain-en-laye, Monceau,\r\nand Fontainbleau, and whose name and memory (as Mr. Loudon observes),\r\nhas been too much forgotten; Bornefond, author of Jardinier Francois, et\r\ndelices de la campagne; Louis Liger, of consummate experience in the\r\nflorist's art, \"auteur d'un grand nombre d'ouvrages sur l'agriculture,\r\net le jardinage,\" and one of whose works was thought not unworthy of\r\nbeing revised by London and Wise, and of whose interesting works the\r\nBiographie Universelle (in 52 tomes) gives a long list, and mentions the\r\ngreat sale which his Jardinier fleuriste once had; Morin, the florist,\r\nmentioned by Evelyn, and whose garden contained ten thousand tulips; the\r\njustly celebrated Jean de la Quintinye, whose precepts, says Voltaire,\r\nhave been followed by all Europe, and his abilities magnificently\r\nrewarded by Louis; Le Notre, the most celebrated gardener (to use Mr.\r\nLoudon's words) that perhaps ever existed, and of whom the Biographie\r\nUniver. observes, that whatever might have been the changes introduced\r\nin whatever Le Notre cultivated, \"il seroit difficile de mettre plus de\r\ngrandeur et de noblesse;\"[3] Charles Riviere du Fresnoy \"qu'il joignot a\r\nun gout general pour tous les arts, des talens particuliers pour la\r\nmusique et le dessein. Il excelloit sur-tout dans l'art de destribuer\r\nles jardins. Il publia plusieurs _Chansons et les Amusemens serieux et\r\ncomiques_: petit ouvrage souvens re-imprime et pleins de peintures vives\r\net plaisantes, de la plupart des etats de la vie. On remarques dans\r\ntouts ses productions une imagination enjouee et singuliere;\"\r\nPontchasteau, who wrote on the cultivation of fruit trees, whose\r\npenitence and devotion were so severely austere, and whose very singular\r\nhistory is given us in the interesting \"Lettres de Madame la Comtesse de\r\nla Riviere;\" Linant, to whom Voltaire was a warm protector and friend,\r\nand who, in 1745, wrote his poem Sur la Perfection des Jardins, sous la\r\nregne de Louis XIV.; and of whom it was said that \"les qualites du\r\ncoeur ne le caracterisoient pas moins que celles de l'esprit;\" Le Pere\r\nRapin;[4] D'Argenville; Le Maistre, curate of Joinville, who in 1719\r\nadded to his \"Fruitier de la France,\" \"Une Dissertation historique sur\r\nl'origine et les progres des Jardins; Vaniere, who wrote the Praedium\r\nRusticum;[5] Arnauld d'Andilli, in so many respects rendered\r\nillustrious, who retired to the convent of Port Royal, (that divine\r\nsolitude, where the whole country for a league round breathed the air of\r\nvirtue and holiness, to quote Mad. de Sevigne's words), and who sent\r\neach year to the queen some of that choice fruit which he there with\r\nsuch zeal cultivated, and which Mazarin \"appelloit en riant des fruits\r\nbenis.\" This good man died at the age of eighty-six, and the letter of\r\nMad. de Sevigne, of the date of Sept. 23, 1671, will alone consign him\r\nto the respect of future ages;[6] Jean Paul de Ardenne, superior of the\r\ncongregation of the oratory of Marseilles, one of the most famous\r\nflorists of the period in which he lived, and who devoted great part of\r\nhis time in deeds of charity; Francis Bertrand, who, in 1757, published\r\nRuris delicae, being poems from Tibullus, Claudian, Horace, and from many\r\nFrench writers, on the pleasures of the country; Mons. de Chabanon;\r\nMorel, who assisted in laying out Ermenonville, and who wrote, among\r\nother works, Theorie des Jardins, ou l'art des Jardins de la Nature; the\r\nanimated Prevost; Gouges de Cessieres, who wrote Les Jardins d'Ornament,\r\nou les Georgiques Francoises; he, too, whom the Prince de Ligne calls\r\n\r\n                 ----_enchanteur_ De Lille!\r\n   _O_ Virgile _moderne_!\r\n\r\nand whose generous invocation to the memory of Captain Cook must endear\r\nhis name to every Englishman;[7] the Viscount Girardin, who wrote De la\r\nComposition des Paysages, who buried Rousseau in his garden at\r\nErmenonville, and who kept a band of musicians to perambulate those\r\ncharming grounds, performing concerts sometimes in the woods, and at\r\nother times on the water, and at night in a room adjoining his hall of\r\ncompany;[8] the venerable Malherbes, the undaunted defender of the\r\noppressed, who throughout his life lost no opportunity of drying up the\r\ntears of the afflicted, and never caused one to flow; whose whole life\r\nhad been consecrated to the happiness of his fellow-creatures and the\r\ndignity of his country, but whose spotless reputation could not save him\r\nfrom the guillotine at his age of seventy-two;[9] Schabol; Latapie, who\r\ntranslated Whately's Observations on Modern Gardening, to which he\r\nadded a discourse on the origin of the art, &c.; Watelet, who wrote\r\nEssai sur les Jardins, and whose name has given rise to some most\r\ncharming lines in De Lille's poem, and whose biography is interestingly\r\ndrawn in the Biog. Univers.; Lezay de Marnesia, whose poems de la Nature\r\nChampetre, and le Bonheur dans les Campagnes, have passed through many\r\neditions, and of whom pleasing mention is made in the above Biog.\r\nUnivers.; M. de Fontaine, author of Le Verger; Masson de Blamont, the\r\ntranslator of Mason's Garden, and Whately's Observations; Francois\r\nRosier; Bertholan, the friend of Franklin.\r\n\r\nI am indebted, in a great measure, for the above list of French authors,\r\nto that immense body of diffuse and elaborate information, the\r\nEncyclopaedia of Gardening, by Mr. Loudon.\r\n\r\nThose who are more conversant with the literature of France, than my\r\nvery limited researches have extended to, can, no doubt, easily\r\nenumerate many very distinguished persons of that country, many talented\r\nmen, who though they may not have written on the subject of gardens, yet\r\nevinced an ardent attachment to them, and became their munificent\r\npatrons. Let us not then omit the name of Charles the Great, or\r\nCharlemagne, in one of whose Capitulaires are _Directions concerning\r\nGardens, and what plants are best to set in them_. He died in 814, after\r\nreigning forty-seven years over France: \"Quoiqu'il ne sut pas ecriere\r\n(says the Nouv. Diet. Hist.), il fit fleurer les sciences. Aussi grand\r\npar ses conquetes, que par l'amour des lettres, et en fut le protecteur\r\net la restaurateur. Son palais fut l'asyle des sciences. Le nom de ce\r\nconquerant et de cet legislateur remplit la terre. Tout fut uni par le\r\nforce de son genie.\" De Sismondi calls him \"a brilliant star in that\r\ndark firmament.\" Mr. Loudon, in p. 40 of his Encyclopaedia, says, that\r\n\"The Abbe Schmidt informs us (_Mag. Encyc._) that this monarch, who had\r\ndomains in every part of France, gave the greatest encouragement to the\r\neradication of forests, and the substitution of orchards and vineyards.\r\nHe was on terms of friendship with the Saracenic prince Haroun al\r\nRaschid, and by that means procured for France the best sorts of pulse,\r\nmelons, peaches, figs, and other fruits.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis I. when he built his palace at Fontainbleau, introduced into its\r\ngardens, much of what he had seen in those of Italy, and when he\r\ncompleted St. Germains, its style of grandeur may be guessed at from its\r\nrocks, cascades, terraces and subterraneous grots.\r\n\r\nHenry IV.'s attachment to agriculture and to gardens, is well known. The\r\nmagnificent improvements he made at St. Germains, and the attention he\r\npaid to his gardens at la Fleche, Vendome, and the Thuilleries, shew\r\nthis. Indeed, his employing Claude Mollet, and Jean Robin, are\r\nsufficient proofs.[10]\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. magnificently rewarded La Quintinye, that original writer,\r\nwho conducted the fine gardens of Tambourneau, and whose precepts Mons.\r\nde Voltaire tells us were followed by all Europe. The zeal of Louis for\r\nthe decorations of gardens, met with an able assistant when he\r\npatronized Le Notre, to do justice to whose name, I can only refer my\r\nreader to the concise but rich review of the grand efforts of this\r\nsingular genius, as they are noticed in p. 35 of Mr. Loudon's\r\nEncyclopaedia, and which \"dazzled and enchanted every class of\r\nobservers.\"[11]\r\n\r\nMadame de Sevigne's delight in gardens pervades many of her letters:\r\nthat of July 1677, paints the charms which one in Paris gave her: \"I was\r\ninvited in the kindest manner possible to sup at Gourville's with Mad.\r\nde Scomberg, Mad. de Frontenac, Mad. de Coulanges, the Duke, M. de la\r\nRochefoucault, Barillon, Briole, Coulanges, Sevigne, in a garden of the\r\nhotel de Conde; there were water-works, bowers, terraces, six hautboys,\r\nsix violins, and the most melodious flutes; a supper which seemed to be\r\nprepared by enchantment, an admirable bass-viol, and a resplendent moon,\r\nwhich witnessed all our pleasures.\" Of her own garden, formed by her own\r\npure taste, M. de Coulanges thus speaks: \"I have spent a most delightful\r\nfortnight here. It is impossible sufficiently to praise the gardens of\r\nthe _Rocks_; they would have their beauties even at Versailles, which is\r\nsaying every thing.\" And that she delighted in what she well knew how to\r\ndescribe, is evident from her letter from _Chaulnes_: \"This is a very\r\nhandsome house, which carries with it an air of grandeur, though it is\r\npartly unfurnished, and the gardens neglected. There is scarcely any\r\nverdure to be seen, and not a nightingale to be heard; in short, it is\r\nstill winter, on the seventeenth of April. But it is easy to imagine the\r\nbeauties of these walks; every thing is regular and magnificent; a\r\nspacious parterre in front, bowling-greens opposite the wings, a large\r\nplaying fountain in the parterre, two in the bowling-greens, and another\r\nat a distance in the middle of a field, which is well named _the\r\nsolitary_; a fine country, beautiful apartments, and a pleasant\r\nprospect, though flat.\" She in another letter from _Chaulnes_ says; \"I\r\nwas walking alone the other day, in these beautiful alleys.\" And in a\r\nsubsequent one she says: \"It is a pity to be obliged to quit so\r\nbeautiful and so charming a place.\" Her frequent mention in her letters\r\nof _my pretty walks_ at the _Rocks_, sufficiently paints her delight in\r\nher own garden. In compliment to this lady, I cannot help applying to\r\nher the exact words which Petrarch applies to Laura: _une haute\r\nintelligence, un coeur pure, qui a la sagesse de l'age avance, ait le\r\nbrilliant de la belle jeunesse_.\r\n\r\nFew passed more happy hours in their garden at _Baville_, than the\r\nillustrious Lamoignon, of whom it was said, that \"Son ame egaloit son\r\ngenie; simple dans ses moeurs, austere dans sa conduite, il etoit le\r\nplus doux des hommes, quand la veuve et l'orphein etoient a ses pieds,\r\n_Boileau_, _Racine_, _Bourdaloue_, _Rapin_, composoit sa petite\r\ncour,\"--and whom Rapin invokes, not only in his poem on gardens,\r\n\r\n   _My flowers aspiring round your brows shall twine,\r\n   And in immortal wreaths, shall all their beauties join;_\r\n\r\nbut in his letters, preserved with those of Rabutin de Bussy, he paints\r\nin high terms the name of Lamoignon, and frequently dwells on his\r\nretreat at _Baville_. Mons. Rab. de Bussy, in a letter to Rapin, says:\r\n\"Que Je vous trouve heureux d'avoir deux mois a passer a _Baville_, avec\r\nMons. le presidant! Il est admirable a Paris; mais il est aimable a sa\r\nmaison de campagne, et vous savez qu'on a plus de plaisir a aimer qu'a\r\nadmirer.\" On his death, Rapin thus speaks of him: \"Il n'y eut jamais une\r\nplus belle ame jointe a un plus bel esprit. Le plus grand de tous les\r\neloges est, que le peuple l'a pleure; et chacun s'est plaint de sa mort\r\ncomme de la perte d'un ami, ou de celle d'un bienfacteur.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of Boileau is too interesting to be overlooked. Many of his\r\nletters and pages discover the delight he took in his garden at\r\n_Auteuil_. In his epistle to _Lamoignon_, he describes his seat there as\r\nhis \"bless'd abode,\" his \"dear delicious shades,\" and he then paints the\r\npleasures of his country seat:\r\n\r\n   _Give me these shades, these forests, and these fields,\r\n   And the soft sweets that rural quiet yields;\r\n   Oh, leave me to the fresh, the fragrant breeze,\r\n   And let me here awhile enjoy my ease.\r\n   Let me Pomona's plenteous blessings crop,\r\n   And see rich autumn's ripen'd burden drop,\r\n   Till Bacchus with full clusters crowns the year,\r\n   And gladdens with his load the vintager._\r\n\r\nHis celebrated epistle to _Anthony_, his old gardener, not only shews\r\nthe kind master, but his own love to his garden. I cannot refrain from\r\nquoting a few lines from Lempriere: \"As a poet, Boilieu has deservedly\r\nobtained the applauses of every man of genius and taste. Not only his\r\ncountrymen boast of the superior effusions of his muse, but foreigners\r\nfeel and admire the graces, the strength and harmony of his verse, and\r\nthat delicacy of satire, and energy of style, by which he raised himself\r\nto immortality.\" Another of his biographers says: \"La religion, qui\r\neclaira ses derniers momens, avoit anime toute sa vie.\" The author of\r\nthe Pursuits of Literature thus speaks of him: \"The most perfect of all\r\nmodern writers, in true taste and judgment. His sagacity was unerring;\r\nhe combined every ancient excellence, and appears original even in the\r\nadoption of acknowledged thoughts and allusions. He is the just and\r\nadequate representative of Horace, Juvenal, and Perseus, united, without\r\none indecent blemish; and for my own part, I have always considered him\r\nas the most finished gentleman that ever wrote.\" In his Life, translated\r\nby Ozell, we are told, that \"he was full of sentiments of humanity,\r\nmildness, and justice. He censured vice, and sharply attacked the bad\r\ntaste of his time, without one spark of envy, or calumny. Whatever\r\nshocked truth, raised in him an indignation which he could not master,\r\nand which accounts for that energy and fire which pervades his satires.\r\nThe sight of any learned man in want, made him so uneasy, that he could\r\nnot forbear lending money. His good nature and justice did farther\r\nappear in his manner of recompensing his domestics, and by his\r\nliberality to the poor. He gave by his will fifty thousand livres to the\r\nsmall parishes adjoining the church of Notre Dame; ten thousand livres\r\nto his valet de chambre, and five thousand to an old woman who had\r\nserved him a long time. But he was not contented to bestow his\r\nbenevolence at his death, and when he was no longer in a condition of\r\nenjoying his estate himself, he was, all his life long, studious in\r\nseeking opportunities of doing good offices.\" Part of this is confirmed\r\nby another biographer: \"Une piete sincere, une foi vive et une charite\r\nsi grande, qu'elle ne lui a presque fait reconnoitre d'autres heritiers\r\nque les pauvres.\" The Lettres of Mad. la Comtesse de la Riviere, and\r\nthose of de Sevigne, frequently mention the charm which attended the\r\nvisits of Boileau.[12] Rabutin du Bussy thus speaks of him, in a letter\r\nto the Pere Rapin, after eulogizing Moliere: \"Despreaux est encore\r\nmerveilleuse; personne ne'crit avec plus de purete; ses pensees sont\r\nfortes, et ce qui m'en plait, toujours vraies.\"\r\n\r\nThe above is a very cursory and brief allusion to what might be gathered\r\nrespecting those superb gardens in France, whose costly and magnificent\r\ndecorations so charmed many of our English nobility and gentry, when\r\ntravelling there, during the periods of Charles II., James II., William,\r\nAnne, and during subsequent reigns. One need recur only to a very few,\r\nas to Rose, who was sent there by Lord Essex, to view Versailles; to\r\nGeorge London, who was commissioned to go there, not only by the same\r\nRose, but who afterwards accompanied the Earl of Portland, King\r\nWilliam's ambassador; but to Evelyn, Addison, Dr. Lister, Kent, when he\r\naccompanied Lord Burlington through France to Italy; to the Earl of Cork\r\nand Orrery (the translator of Pliny's Letters), whose gardens at\r\n_Marston_, and at _Caledon_, and whose letters from Italy, all shew the\r\neagerness with which he must have viewed the gardens of France, when\r\npassing through the provinces towards Florence; to Ray, Lady M. W.\r\nMontague, Bolingbroke, Peterborough, Smollet, John Wilks, John Horne\r\n(when he met Mr. Sterne, or designed to meet him, at _Toulouse_), to\r\nGray, Walpole, R. P. Knight, who must have passed through the rich\r\nprovinces of France, as, in his work on Taste, he speaks of \"terraces\r\nand borders intermixed with vines and flowers, (_as I have seen them in\r\nItalian villas_, and in some old English gardens in the same style),\r\nwhere the mixture of splendour, richness, and neatness, was beautiful\r\nand pleasing in the highest degree;\" and to the lately deceased Sir U.\r\nPrice, who must also have passed through France, to view (with the\r\neagerness with which he did view) the rich and magnificently decorated\r\ngardens of Italy, \"aided with the splendour and magnificence of art,\"\r\ntheir ballustrades, their fountains, basons, vases and statues, and\r\nwhich he dwells on in his Essays with the same enthusiasm as when he\r\nthere contemplated the works of Titian, Paul Veronese, and other great\r\nmasters. Indeed, those pages where he regrets the demolition of many of\r\nour old English gardens, and when he dwells on the probability that even\r\nRaphael, Giulio Romano, and M. Angelo, (which last planted the famous\r\ncypresses in the garden of the Villa d'Este) were consulted on the\r\ndecorations of some of the old Italian ones; these pages at once shew\r\nthe fascinating charms of his classic pen.[13]\r\n\r\nEngland can boast too of very great names, who have been attached to\r\nthis art, and most zealously patronized it, though they have not written\r\non the subject:--Lord Burleigh, Lord Hudson, Sir Walter Raleigh, Lord\r\nCapell, who honoured himself by several years correspondence with La\r\nQuintinye; William the Third,--for Switzer tells us, that \"in the least\r\ninterval of ease, gardening took up a greater part of his time, in which\r\nhe was not only a delighter, but likewise a great judge,\"--the Earl of\r\nEssex, whom the mild and benevolent Lord William Russell said \"was the\r\nworthiest, the justest, the sincerest, and the most concerned for the\r\npublic, of any man he ever knew;\" Lord William Russell himself, too, on\r\nwhom Thomson says,\r\n\r\n   _Bring every sweetest flower, and let me strew\r\n   The grave where Russell lies_,\r\n\r\nwhose fall Switzer feelingly laments, as one of the best of masters, and\r\nencouragers of arts and sciences, particularly gardening, that that age\r\nproduced, and who \"made _Stratton_, about seven miles from Winchester,\r\nhis seat, and his gardens there some of the best that were made in those\r\nearly days, such indeed as have mocked some that have been done since;\r\nand the gardens of Southampton House, in Bloomsbury Square, were also of\r\nhis making;\" the generous friend of this Lord William Russell, the manly\r\nand patriotic Duke of Devonshire, who erected _Chatsworth_, that noble\r\nspecimen of a magnificent spirit;[14] Henry Earl of Danby, the Duke of\r\nArgyle, beheaded in 1685, for having supported the rebellion of\r\nMonmouth; the Earl of Halifax, the friend of Addison, Swift, Pope, and\r\nSteele, and on whom a funeral poem thus speaks,\r\n\r\n   _In the rich furniture of whose fair mind,\r\n   Those dazzling intellectual graces shin'd,\r\n   That drew the love and homage of mankind._[15]\r\n\r\nLord Weymouth; Dr. Sherard of Eltham; Collinson, \"to whose name is\r\nattached all that respect which is due to benevolence and virtue;\"\r\nGrindal, Bishop of London, who cultivated with great success the vine\r\nand other productions of his garden at Fulham; Compton, Bishop of\r\nLondon, eminent, as Mr. Falconer in his Fulham observes, for his\r\nunbounded charity and beneficence, and who was so struck with the\r\ngenius, the learning, and probity of Mr. Ray, that he was almost at the\r\nentire charge of erecting the monument to him; the Earl of Scarborough,\r\nan accomplished nobleman, immortalized by the enchanting pen of Pope,\r\nand the fine pen of Chesterfield; the Earl of Gainsborough; the great\r\nChatham, whose taste in the embellishment of rural nature has been\r\nexultingly acknowledged by Mr. Walpole, and by George Mason;[16] with\r\nnumerous other men of rank and science.[17] These have highly assisted\r\nin elevating gardening to the rank it has long since held, and has\r\nallured multitudes to this delightful science:--no wonder, when _Homer_\r\n=writeth how= _Laertes_ =the olde man, was wont with his travaile in his\r\nOrchards, to drive from his minde the sorrow hee tooke for the absence\r\nof his sonne=. When old Gerarde asks his _courteous and well-willing\r\nreaders_--\"whither do all men walk for their honest recreation, but\r\nwhere the earth hath most beneficially painted her face with flourishing\r\ncolours? and what season of the year more longed for than the spring,\r\nwhose gentle breath enticeth forth the kindly sweets, and makes them\r\nyield their fragrant smells?\" When the Lord Chancellor Bacon declares a\r\ngarden \"is the purest of human pleasures; it is the greatest refreshment\r\nto the spirits of man:\" and when this wonderfully gifted man thus fondly\r\ndwells on part of its allurements;--\"the breath of flowers is far\r\nsweeter in the air (where it comes and goes like the warbling of music),\r\nthan in the hand; therefore, nothing is more fit for that delight, than\r\nto know what be the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air; the\r\nflower, which above all others yields the sweetest smell in the air, is\r\nthe violet;[18] next to that is the musk rose, then the\r\nstrawberry-leaves, dying with a most-excellent cordial smell; then sweet\r\nbriar, then wall-flowers, which are very delightful to be set under a\r\nparlour, or lower chamber window; but those which perfume the air most\r\ndelightfully, not passed by as the rest, but being trodden upon and\r\ncrushed, are three--that is, burnet, wild thyme, and water-mints;\r\ntherefore you are to set whole alleys of them, to have the pleasure when\r\nyou walk or tread.\"[19] Or when Mr. Evelyn, in the joy of his\r\nenthusiasm, exultingly transposed from Virgil:--\r\n\r\n   O fortunatos nimium, bona si sua norint\r\n   _Horticulas_!\r\n\r\nand who declared, that the employ and felicity of an excellent gardener\r\nwas preferable to all other diversions. When Mr. Addison says that a\r\ngarden \"fills the mind with calmness and tranquillity, and lays all its\r\nturbulent passions at rest.\" When Sir William Temple (who infused into\r\nhis writings the graces of some of the best writers of ancient times),\r\nthus allures his readers: \"_Epicurus_, whose admirable wit, felicity of\r\nexpression, excellence of nature, sweetness of conversation, temperance\r\nof life, and constancy of death, made him so beloved by his friends,\r\nadmired by his scholars, and honoured by the Athenians, passed his time\r\nwholly in his garden; there he studied, there he exercised, there he\r\ntaught his philosophy; and indeed no other sort of abode seems to\r\ncontribute so much to both the tranquillity of mind, and indolence of\r\nbody, which he made his chief ends. The sweetness of air, the\r\npleasantness of smells, the verdure of plants, the cleanness and\r\nlightness of food, the exercises of working or walking; but above all,\r\nthe exemption from cares and solitude, seem equally to favour and\r\nimprove both contemplation and health, the enjoyment of sense and\r\nimagination, and thereby the quiet and ease both of the body and mind.\"\r\nWhen the industrious Switzer says:--\"'Tis in the quiet enjoyment of\r\nrural delights, the refreshing and odoriferous breezes of garden air,\r\nthat the deluge of vapours, and those terrors of hypochondraism, which\r\ncrowd and oppress the head are dispelled.\" When the industrious and\r\nphilosophic Bradley observes, that \"though the trouble of the mind wears\r\nand destroys the constitution even of the most healthful body, all kinds\r\nof gardens contribute to health.\" When Pope,[20] who loved to breathe\r\nthe sweet and fragrant air of gardens, in one of his letters says, \"I am\r\nin my garden, amused and easy; this is a scene where one finds no\r\ndisappointment.\" When that \"universally esteemed and beloved man,\" the\r\nPrince de Ligne, declares, \"Je voudrois echauffer tout l'univers de mon\r\ngout pour les jardins. Il me semble qu'il est impossible, qu'un mechant\r\npuisse l'avoir. Il n'est point de vertus que Je ne suppose a celui qui\r\naime a parler et a faire des jardins. Peres de famille, inspirez la\r\njardinomanie a vos enfans.[21] When a taste for gardening (as Mr. Cobbet\r\nobserves) \"is much more innocent, more pleasant, more free from\r\ntemptation to cost, than any other; so pleasant in itself! It is\r\nconducive to health, by means of the irresistible temptation which it\r\noffers to early rising; it tends to turn the minds of youth from\r\namusements and attachments of a frivolous or vicious nature; it is a\r\ntaste which is indulged at home; it tends to make home pleasant, and to\r\nendear us to the spot on which it is our lot to live.\" When Mr. Johnson\r\nforcibly paints the allurements to a love for this art, when concluding\r\nhis energetic volume on gardening, by quoting from Socrates, that \"it is\r\nthe source of health, strength, plenty, riches, and of a thousand sober\r\ndelights and honest pleasures.\"--And from Lord Verulam, that amid its\r\nscenes and pursuits, \"life flows pure, and the heart more calmly beats.\"\r\nAnd when M. le V. H. de Thury, president de la Societe d'Horticulture de\r\nParis, in his Discours d'Installation says: \"Dans tous les temps et dans\r\ntous les pays, les hommes les plus celebres, les plus grands capitaines,\r\nles princes, et les rois, se sont livres avec delices, et souvent avec\r\npassion, a la culture des plantes et des jardins.\" And among other\r\ninstances he cites \"Descartes, qui se livrait avec une egale ardeur a la\r\nscience des astres et a la culture des fleurs de son jardin, et qui\r\nsouvent, la nuit, quittait ses observations celestes pour etudier le\r\nsommeil et la floraison de ses plantes avant le lever du soliel.\"[22]\r\nPetrarch, too, who has enchanted every nation and every age, from his\r\nendeared Vaucluse, thus speaks of his garden: \"I have formed two; I do\r\nnot imagine they are to be equalled in all the world: I should feel\r\nmyself inclined to be angry with fortune, if there were any so beautiful\r\nout of Italy. I have store of pleasant green walks, with trees shadowing\r\nthem most sweetly.\" Indeed, what Cicero applies to another science, may\r\nwell apply to horticulture: \"nihil est _agriculturae_ melius, nihil\r\nuberius, nihil dulcius, nihil homine, nihil libero dignius.\" Let me\r\nclose with a most brilliant name;--the last resource in the _Candide_ of\r\nVoltaire is,--_cultivate your garden_.\r\n\r\nIn my transient review of the gardens of ancient times, at the\r\ncommencement of the following work, I have not even glanced at those of\r\nthe _Saxons_, in this island; when one should have thought that the\r\nmajestic name of ALFRED alone, would have made a search of this nature\r\ninteresting, even if such search were unavailing. I have also\r\ninadvertently omitted any allusion to those of the _Danes_ and the\r\n_Normans_. I have only then now to say, that Mr. Johnson's researches,\r\nas to these gardens, in pp. 31, 37, 38, 39 and 40 of his lately\r\npublished History of English Gardening, with his elegant language and\r\nthe flow of sentiment that pervades those pages, would make any search\r\nor review of mine presumptuous. In those pages, he dwells on the\r\ntendency which the then introduction of the christian religion had to\r\nsoften the manners of the people, and by thus rendering them more\r\ndomestic, gardening became an art congenial to their feelings; and\r\nwhilst the country at large was devastated by war, the property of the\r\nreligious establishments was held sacred, and varieties of vegetables\r\npreserved, which otherwise would soon have become extinct, if cultivated\r\nin less hallowed ground. He then traces the existence of many gardens,\r\norchards, and vineyards, belonging to our monasteries, proving, that\r\neven in the time of the _Danes_, horticulture continued \"silently to\r\nadvance,\" and that at the time of the arrival of the _Normans_, gardens\r\nwere generally in the possession of the laity, as well as of the\r\necclesiastics; and he refers to Doomsday Book for his assertion, that\r\n\"there is no reason to doubt, that at this period, every house, from the\r\npalace to the cottage, was possessed of a garden of some size.\" He\r\nconcludes with interesting references to the gardens, vineyards, and\r\norchards, of the Abbot of Ely and other monks.\r\n\r\nThe above work of Mr. Johnson's is the result of original thought, and\r\nof an ardent and extended scientific research. Mine is a compilation,\r\n\"made with a pair of scissors,\" to copy the words of Mr. Mathias, which\r\nhe applies to a certain edition of Pope. I content myself, however, with\r\nthe reflection of Mr. Walpole, that \"they who cannot perform great\r\nthings themselves, may yet have a satisfaction in doing justice to those\r\nwho can.\"\r\n\r\nHaving alluded at pp. 71 and 120 to Dr. Alison, and having given at p.\r\n211 Dr. Dibdin's tribute to him, I cannot omit reminding my reader, that\r\nthe graceful language, the sublime and solemn thoughts, which this\r\nadmirable divine has transfused into many of his Sermons on the Seasons,\r\nmake one doubly feel the truth and propriety with which he has so\r\nliberally reviewed Mr. Whately's _Observations on Modern Gardening_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   ON\r\n   THE PORTRAITS\r\n   OF\r\n   English Authors on Gardening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE PORTRAITS OF ENGLISH AUTHORS ON GARDENING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest accounts we have of gardens, are those recorded in Holy\r\nWrit; their antiquity, therefore, appears coeval with that of time\r\nitself. The Garden in Eden had every tree good for food, or pleasant to\r\nthe sight. Noah planted a Vineyard. Solomon, in the true spirit of\r\nhorticultural zeal, says, _I planted me Vineyards, I made me Gardens and\r\nOrchards, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit_. We have\r\nall heard of the grandeur of Nebuchadnezzar's Gardens.\r\n\r\nWhether that of Alcinous was fabulous or not, it gave rise to Homer's\r\nlofty strains:--\r\n\r\n   The balmy spirit of the western gale\r\n   Eternal breathes on flowers untaught to fail;\r\n   The same mild season gives the blooms to blow,\r\n   The buds to harden, and the fruit to grow.[23]\r\n\r\nThat Homer was all alive to the rich scenery of nature, is evident, even\r\nfrom his Calypso's Cave:--\r\n\r\n   All o'er the cavern'd rock a sprouting vine\r\n   Laid forth ripe clusters. Hence four limpid founts\r\n   Nigh to each other ran, in rills distinct,\r\n   Huddling along with many a playful maze.\r\n   Around them the soft meads profusely bloom'd\r\n   Fresh violets and balms.[24]\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians, the Persians, and other remote nations, prided themselves\r\non their magnificent gardens. Diodorus Siculus mentions one \"enriched\r\nwith palm trees, and vines, and every kind of delicious fruit, by\r\nflowery lawns and planes, and cypresses of stupendous magnitude, with\r\nthickets of myrtle, and laurel, and bay.\" He paints too the attachment\r\nwhich some of the ancients had to landscape scenery:--\r\n\r\n   None of art's works, but prodigally strown\r\n   By nature, with her negligence divine.\r\n\r\nThe splendid gardens at Damascus, were superintended by a native of\r\nMalaga, who \"traversed the burning sands of Africa, for the purpose of\r\ndescribing such vegetables as could support the fervid heat of that\r\nclimate.\" The cities of Samarcand, Balckd, Ispahan, and Bagdad, were\r\nenveloped and surrounded by luxurious and splendid gardens. No wonder\r\nwhen those countries were partly governed by such celebrated men as\r\nHaroun-al-Raschid, and his son Al-Mamoun, the generous protectors of\r\nArabian literature, and which son (about the year 813) has been justly\r\ntermed the _Augustus_ of Bagdad. \"Study, books, and men of letters, (I\r\nam quoting the eloquent pages of De Sismondi _On the Literature of the\r\nArabians_,) almost entirely engrossed his attention. Hundreds of camels\r\nmight be seen entering Bagdad loaded with nothing but manuscripts and\r\npapers. Masters, instructors, translators, and commentators, formed the\r\ncourt of Al-Mamoun, which appeared rather to be a learned academy than\r\nthe centre of government in a warlike empire.\"\r\n\r\nThe gardens of Epicurus, and of Pisistratus, Cimon, and Theophrastus,\r\nwere the most famous of any in the Grecian empire. Those of Herculaneum\r\nmay be seen in the 2nd vol. of the paintings found there. The luxurious\r\ngardens of the affluent Seneca, and the delight with which Cicero speaks\r\nof his paternal seat, (which enraptured his friend Atticus with its\r\nbeauty,) and the romantic ones of Adrian, at Tivoli, and of Lucullus, of\r\nSallust, of the rich and powerful Crassus, and of Pompey, shew the\r\ndelight which the old Romans took in them. One may gather this also from\r\nLivy; and Virgil's energy of language warmly paints the\r\n\r\n                             ----flowering pride\r\n   Of meads and streams that through the valleys glide.\r\n   A country cottage near a crystal flood,\r\n   A winding valley, and a lofty wood.\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   Leisure and calm in groves, and cooling vales;\r\n   Grottoes and babbling brooks, and darksome dales.\r\n\r\nMessaline (says a translation of Tacitus) avoit une passion extreme pour\r\nles jardins de Lucullus, qu'il embellisoit superbement, ajoutant tous\r\nles jours quelque nouvelles beautez a celles qu'ils avoint receues de\r\nleur premier maitre.\r\n\r\nWe are reminded in a magic page of our own immortal poet, of those of\r\nJulius Caesar, and of\r\n\r\n                         ----_his_ walks,\r\n   His private arbours, and new-planted orchards,\r\n\r\nwhen the noble Antony invokes the Romans to\r\n\r\n             ----kiss dead Caesar's wounds,\r\n   And dip their napkins in his sacred blood.\r\n\r\nHorace's incomparable lines on the happiness and delight of a country\r\nlife, his country granges, his woods, his garden, and his grove; and\r\nmany of the other Roman writers, abundantly shew their attachment to\r\ngardens, as accompaniments to their splendid villas. There was scarcely\r\na romantic valley that was not crowded with their villas.\r\n\r\nMartial and Juvenal ridicule the clipped box trees, cut dragons, and\r\nsimilar grotesque fancies, at some of their villas, both admiring the\r\nnobler grace with which nature adorned each spot.[25]\r\n\r\nThe Romans were perhaps the first who introduced that art into Britain,\r\nmeagerly as they did introduce it. The earliest account I can find of an\r\nEnglish writer on Gardening, is,\r\n\r\nAlfred, an _Englishman_, surnamed the Philosopher, much respected at\r\nRome. He died 1270, and left four books on the Meteors of Aristotle;\r\nalso one on _Vegetables_, and five on the Consolations of Boethius. We\r\nare not _very_ likely to discover _his_ portrait. Nor that of the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\nHENRY DANIEL, a Dominican friar, said to be well skilled in the natural\r\nphilosophy and physic of his time, left a manuscript inscribed _Aaron\r\nDanielis_. He therein treats De re Herbaria, de Arboribus, _Fructibus_,\r\n&c. He flourished about the year 1379.--N. B. I have copied this article\r\nfrom Dr. Pulteney's Sketches, vol. 1, page 23.[26]\r\n\r\nI believe there are no Portraits engraved, nor perhaps yet discovered,\r\nof the following sixty-nine persons; at least I know of none:--\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD ARNOLDE, who in his Chronicle, printed in 1502, has a chapter on\r\n\"The crafte of graffynge, and plantyne, and alterynge of fruyts, as well\r\nin colours, as in taste.\" The celebrated poem of the Nut-brown Maid\r\nfirst appeared in this Chronicle. Sir E. Brydges, in vol. 6 of his\r\nCensura Literaria, has transcribed the whole poem as it appears in\r\nArnolde.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS TUSSER, whose memory has had the felicity to merit the notice of\r\nMr. Warton, in his History of English Poetry, from his having published\r\nhis poem of \"A Hundreth good Pointes of Husbandrie, imprinted at London,\r\nin Flete strete, within Temple barre, at the syne of the Hand and\r\nStarre, by Richard Totell, An. 1577.\" A copy of this first edition\r\n(probably unique) is preserved in the British Museum. A re-print of this\r\nsingular literary rarity is given in Mr. Hazlewood's British\r\nBibliographer. The subsequent editions of this curious book are\r\ninterestingly enumerated by Mr. Mavor, in his edition of Tusser. No\r\nportrait I believe has been discovered of this benevolent man, whose\r\ngood sense, impressive maxims, enlightened and philosophic turn of mind\r\nand feeling for the poor, shine through most pages of his poem:--\r\n\r\n   What better bed than conscience good, to pass the night with sleep,\r\n   What better work, than daily care, from sin thyself to keep?\r\n   What better thought, than think on God, and daily him to serve,\r\n   What better gift than to the poor, that ready be to sterve?\r\n\r\nHis estimate of life is concise:--\r\n\r\n   To death we must stoop, be we high, be we low,\r\n   But how and how suddenly few be that know;\r\n   What carry we then but a sheet to the grave,\r\n   (To cover this carcass) of all that we have?\r\n\r\nHis hospitable heart thus pleads for the desolate, during the\r\nfestivities of Christmas, and his love of \"mirth and good cheer\" makes\r\nhim not forget Harvests home:--\r\n\r\n   At Christmas, the hardness of winter doth rage,\r\n   A griper of all things, and specially age;\r\n   Then sadly poor people, the young and the old,\r\n   Be sorest oppressed with hunger and cold.\r\n\r\n   At Christmas, by labour there's little to get,\r\n   That wanting--the poorest in danger are set:\r\n   What season then better, of all the whole year,\r\n   Thy needy, poor neighbour, to comfort and cheer.\r\n\r\n   At Christmas be merry, and thankful withal,\r\n   And feast thy poor neighbours, the great with the small:\r\n   Yea all the year long, to the poor let us give,\r\n   God's blessing to follow us, whiles we do live.\r\n\r\n   In harvest time, harvest folk, servants and all\r\n   Should make, all together, good cheer in the hall;\r\n   And fill out the black bowl of blythe to their song,\r\n   And let them be merry all harvest time long.\r\n\r\n   Once ended thy harvest, let none be beguil'd,\r\n   Please such as did help thee--man, woman, and child,--\r\n   Thus doing, with alway, such help as they can,\r\n   Thou winnest the praise of the labouring man.\r\n\r\n   Now look up to God-ward, let tongue never cease\r\n   In thanking of him, for his mighty increase,\r\n   Accept my good will--for a proof go and try;\r\n   The better thou thrivest, the gladder am I.\r\n\r\nTusser died about the year 1583, aged about sixty-five, and is buried in\r\nSt. Mildred's church, in the Poultry. His epitaph is preserved in\r\nStowe's Survey of London; and (as Mr. Mavor observes) it is perfectly in\r\ncharacter with the man and his writings; and if conjecture may be\r\nallowed, was penned by himself:--\r\n\r\n   Here Thomas Tusser, clad in earth, doth lie,\r\n   Who sometime made the Points of Husbandry.\r\n   By him then learn thou may'st. Here learn we must,\r\n   When all is done, we sleep and turn to dust.\r\n   And yet, through Christ, to heaven we hope to go:\r\n   Who reads his books, shall find his faith was so.\r\n\r\nHis book exhibits an authentic picture of the state of horticulture\r\nduring the time of Mary, and Elizabeth; and, as Mr. Warton observes, his\r\nwork \"is valuable as a genuine picture of the agriculture, the rural\r\narts, and the domestic oeconomy and customs of our industrious\r\nancestors.\"\r\n\r\nWalter Blith says of him:--\"As for Master Tusser, who rimeth out of his\r\nexperience, if thou delightest therein, thou mayst find things worthy\r\nthy observation.\"\r\n\r\nSir John Hawkins, in his History of Music, thus writes:--\"The life of\r\nthis poor man was a series of misfortunes; and is a proof of the truth\r\nof that saying in Holy Scripture, that 'the battle is not to the strong,\r\nnor the race to the swift.' As to the Points of Husbandry, it is written\r\nin familiar verse, and abounds with many curious particulars, that\r\nbespeak the manners, the customs, and the modes of living in the\r\ncountry, from the year 1520 to about half a century after; besides\r\nwhich, it discovers such a degree of oeconomical wisdom in the author,\r\nsuch a sedulous attention to the honest arts of thriving, such a general\r\nlove of mankind, such a regard to justice, and a reverence for religion,\r\nthat we do not only lament his misfortunes, but wonder at them; and are\r\nat a loss to account for his dying poor, who understood so well the\r\nmethod to become rich.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Literary Life and Select Works of Benjamin Stillingfleet,\" I\r\nselect a small part of what that worthy man says of Tusser:--\"He seems\r\nto have been a good-natured cheerful man, and though a lover of\r\noeconomy, far from meanness, as appears in many of his precepts,\r\nwherein he shews his disapprobation of that pitiful spirit, which makes\r\nfarmers starve their cattle, their land, and every thing belonging to\r\nthem; chusing rather to lose a pound than spend a shilling. Upon the\r\nwhole, his book displays all the qualities of a well-disposed man, as\r\nwell as of an able farmer. He wrote in the infancy of farming, and\r\ntherefore I shall give a full account of his practice, especially as his\r\nprecepts will be comprised in a narrow compass, and as a sort of justice\r\ndone to him as an original writer.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mavor observes, \"The precepts of Tusser indeed are so excellent,\r\nthat few can read them without profit and improvement; he appears to\r\nhave possessed such a degree of pious resignation to the will of the\r\nSupreme, of christian charity, and of good humour, under all his\r\nmiscarriages, that his character rises high in our esteem, independent\r\nof his merits as a writer. The cultivated and liberal mind of Tusser\r\nseems to have been ill-suited to his fortune, and to his vocation. A\r\nlove of hospitality probably kept him from independence; yet if he was\r\nimprudent, we cannot help loving the man and admiring the justness of\r\nhis sentiments on every subject connected with life and morals.\"\r\n\r\nFuller, in his _Worthies of Essex_, says, \"he spread his bread with all\r\nsorts of butter, yet none would stick thereon. Yet I hear no man to\r\ncharge him with any vicious extravagancy, or visible carelessness,\r\nimputing his ill success to some occult cause in God's counsel.\"\r\n\r\nI am indebted, in some degree, for these several testimonies, to Mr.\r\nMavor's spirited edition of this book, which he has enriched with a\r\nbiographical sketch of Tusser, and with many interesting illustrations\r\nof his poem. He exhibits another instance of the private character of\r\nTusser, in his concluding remarks on the last page of his work:--\"The\r\nmoral feeling and the pious resignation which breathe in the concluding\r\nstanzas of this poem, leave a powerful impression on the mind; and\r\nwhatever vicissitudes in life the Editor or his Readers may experience,\r\nhe wishes for Himself and for Them, the same philosophic and christian\r\ncomposure, on a retrospect of the past, and the anticipated view of\r\nfuturity.\"\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Warton's remarks on Tusser, Mr. Mavor thus partly speaks:--\"For\r\nthe personal kindness of Warton to me, at an early period of life, I\r\nshall ever retain an affectionate remembrance of him, and for his genius\r\nand high attainments in literature, I feel all that deference and\r\nrespect which can belong to his most enthusiastic admirers; but no man\r\nwas less a judge of the merits of a book on Husbandry and Huswifry.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Warton observes, that \"Tusser's general precepts have often an\r\nexpressive brevity, and are sometimes pointed with an epigrammatic turn,\r\nand smartness of allusion.\"\r\n\r\nIn Tusser's poetical account of his own unsuccessful life,\r\n\r\n   _How through the briers my youthful years\r\n   Have run their race_,--\r\n\r\nhow he was forced from his father's house when a little boy, and driven\r\nlike a POSTING HORSE, being impressed to sing as a chorister, at\r\nWallingford College; his miseries there, and the _stale bread_ they gave\r\nhim; the fifty-three stripes the poor lad received at Eton, when\r\nlearning Latin; his happy transfer to Trinity College, which to him\r\nseemed a removal from hell to heaven; the generosity of Lord Paget,\r\n\r\n   _Whose soul I trust is with the just_;\r\n\r\nthen his\r\n\r\n                      ----_good parents dy'd\r\n   One after one, till both were gone,\r\n   Whose souls in bliss, be long ere this._\r\n\r\nHis remaining ten years at court, where\r\n\r\n   _Cards and dice, with Venus' vice,\r\n   And peevish pride, from virtue wide,\r\n       With some so wraught,\r\n   That Tyburn play, made them away,\r\n       Or beggars state._\r\n\r\nHis residing in _Suffolk_, as a farmer,\r\n\r\n       _To moil and toil,\r\n   With loss and pain, to little gain,\r\n       To cram Sir Knave_;\r\n\r\nhis removal to near Dereham Abbey, which he left, (though stored with\r\nflesh and fish) from the squabbles and brawls of _lord with lord_; the\r\ndeath of the worthy Sir Richard Southwell,\r\n\r\n              ----_that jewel great,\r\n   Which op'd his door to rich and poor,\r\n   So bounteously_,--\r\n\r\non whose decease he was left to _sink or swim_; his removal to\r\nSalisbury, as a singing man; thence\r\n\r\n   _With sickness worn, as one forlorn,_\r\n\r\nhe removed to a parsonage house in Essex, to collect tithes, in its\r\n_miry ways_; his foreboding the parson's death, and foreseeing new\r\ncharges about to be made for tithes,\r\n\r\n                ----_I spy'd, if parson died,\r\n   (All hope in vain) to hope for gain,\r\n       I might go dance;\r\n   Once rid my hand, of pars'nage land,\r\n   Hence, by-and-by, away went I\r\n   To London straight, to hope and wait\r\n       For better chance._\r\n\r\nFrom which place the plague drove him to Cambridge, to\r\n\r\n   _The college, best of all the rest,_\r\n   _With thanks to thee, O Trinity!_\r\n   _Through thee and thine, for me and mine,_\r\n         _Some stay I got._\r\n\r\nHe concludes with pious resignation to God.[27]\r\n\r\n\r\nDIDYMUS MOUNTAIN, who, in 1571, wrote \"The Gardener's Labyrinth,\" in\r\n4to. \"wherein are set forth, divers knottes and mazes, cunningly handled\r\nfor the beautifying of gardens.\" And in 1577 appeared a second part,\r\n\"with the wittie ordering of other daintie hearbes, delectable flowres,\r\npleasaunt fruites, and fine rootes, as the like hath not heretofore been\r\nvttered of any.\" Other editions in 4to. 1608, and in folio 1652.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARNABY GOOCHE published The whole art and trade of Husbandry, contained\r\nin foure books, _enlarged_ by Barnaby Googe, Esq. 4to. black letter,\r\n1578. The two later editions, in 1614 and 1631, both in black letter,\r\nand in 4to. are said by Weston to have been re-printed by Gervaise\r\nMarkham. The 2nd book treats \"Of Gardens, Orchards, and Woods.\"\r\n\r\nIn the 2nd vol. of the _Censura Litt._ is some information respecting B.\r\nGooche, and his epistle to the reader shews his own liberal mind: \"I\r\nhaue thought it meet (good Reader) for thy further profit and pleasure,\r\nto put into English, these foure Bookes of Husbandry, _collected and\r\nset forth_, _by Master Conrade Heresbatch_, a great and a learned\r\nCounceller of the Duke of _Cleues_: not thinking it reason, though I\r\nhaue altered and increased his vvorke, _with mine owne readings and\r\nobseruations_, ioined with the experience of sundry my friends, to take\r\nfrom him (as diuers in the like case haue done) the honour and glory of\r\nhis owne trauaile: Neither is it my minde, that this either his doings,\r\nor mine, should deface, or any wayes darken the good enterprise, or\r\npainfull trauailes of such our Countrymen of England, as haue\r\nplentifully written of this matter: but alwayes haue, and do giue them\r\nthe reuerence and honour due to so vertuous, and well disposed\r\nGentlemen, namely, _Master Fitzherbert_, and _Master Tusser_: vvhose\r\nvvorkes may, in my fancie, without any presumption, compare with any,\r\neither _Varro_, _Columella_, or _Palladius_ of _Rome_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR HUGH PLATT, \"that learned and great observer,\" but of whom we know\r\nso little, was, as Mr. Weston, in his Catalogue of English Authors,\r\ninforms us, \"the most ingenious husbandman of the age he lived in: yet,\r\nso great was his modesty, that all his works seem to be posthumous,\r\nexcept the _Paradise of Flora_, which appeared in 1600, when it is\r\nprobable he was living. He spent part of his time at Copt-hall, in\r\nEssex, or at Bishop's-hall, in Middlesex, at each of which places he had\r\na country seat; but his town residence was Lincoln's Inn. He held a\r\ncorrespondence with all lovers of agriculture and gardening throughout\r\nEngland; and such was the justice and modesty of his temper, that he\r\nalways named the author of every discovery communicated to him.\" In 1606\r\nhe had a garden in St. Martin's Lane. A list of his works appears in the\r\nlate Dr. Watts's most laborious work, the Bibl. Brit. in 4 vols. 4to. In\r\nhis \"Floraes Paradise, beautified and adorned with sundry sorts of\r\ndelicate fruites and flowers, to be sold in Paule's church-yard, at the\r\nsigne of the Holy Ghost, 1608,\" 12mo. he thus concludes his address to\r\nthe studious and well affected reader:--\"_And thus, gentle Reader,\r\nhauing acquainted thee with my long, costly, and laborious Collections,\r\nnot written at adventure, or by an imaginary conceit in a Scholler's\r\npriuate Studie, but wrung out of the earth, by the painfull hand of\r\nexperience: and hauing also giuen thee a touch of Nature, whom no man as\r\nyet euer durst send naked into the worlde without her veyle; and\r\nexpecting, by thy good entertainement of these, some encouragement for\r\nhigher and deeper discoueries heereafter, I leaue thee to the God of\r\nNature, from whom all the true light of Nature proceedeth._\r\nBednall-greene, _neere London_, _this 2 of July, 1608_.\"\r\n\r\nIn his chapter of \"An offer of some new, rare, and profitable\r\nInventions,\" after speaking of \"the most rare and peerless plant of all\r\nthe rest, I meane the grape,\" he mentions the wholesomeness of the wine\r\nhe then made from his garden at _Bednall-greene_, _neere London_:--\"And\r\nif any exception shold be taken against the race and delicacie of them,\r\nI am content to submit them to the censure of the best mouthes, that\r\nprofesse any true skill in the iudgement of high country wines: although\r\nfor their better credit herein, I could bring in the French Embassador,\r\nwho (now almost two yeeres since, comming to my house of purpose to tast\r\nthese wines) gaue this sentence vpon them; that he neuer drank any\r\nbetter nevv Wine in France. And _Sir Francis Vere_, that martiall\r\nMirrour of our times, who is seldom or never without a cup of excellent\r\nwine, at his table, assured me that he neuer dranke the like vnto mine,\r\nbut once, and that in France. So that now mee thinks I begin to growe\r\nsomewhat strong in my supporters; and therefore I make some doubt,\r\nwhether I shall need to bring in that renowned Lady _Arabella_, the\r\nCountesse of _Cumberland_, the Lady _Anne Clifford_, the Lady\r\n_Hastings_, the Lady _Candish_, and most of the Maides of Honour, with\r\ndiuers Lordes, Knights, and Gentlemen of good worth, that haue generally\r\napplauded the same; or leaue it heere to worke out his owne credit in\r\nhis due time, because it is rich, and of a strong boiling nature.\"\r\n\r\nIn his chapter of \"Secrets in the ordering of Trees and Plants,\" he\r\nalludes to a gardener of the name of Maister _Andrew Hill_, or to his\r\ngarden, no less than twenty-three times; and frequently to one of the\r\nname of Maister _Pointer_,[28] _of Twickenham_. Also to one of the name\r\nof _Colborne_; and to a parson _Simson_. He thus concludes this\r\nchapter:--\"Heere I will conclude with a pretty conceit of that delicate\r\nknight, Sir _Francis Carew_; who, for the better accomplishment of his\r\nroyall entertainemet of our late Queene of happy memory, at his house at\r\n_Beddington_, led her Maiestie to a Cherrie tree, whose fruite hee had\r\nof purpose kept backe from ripening, at the least one month after all\r\nCherries had taken their farewell of England. This secret he performed,\r\nby straining a Tent or cover of canvas ouer the whole tree, and wetting\r\nthe same now and then with a scoope or horne, as the heate of the\r\nweather required; and so, by with-holding the sunne-beames from\r\nreflecting vppon the berries, they grew both great, and were very long\r\nbefore they had gotten their perfect cherrie-colour: and when hee was\r\nassured of her Maiesties comming, he remoued the Tent, and a few sunny\r\ndaies brought them to their full maturitie.\"\r\n\r\nIn the 2nd vol. of _Censura Litt._ is some information respecting Sir\r\nHugh.\r\n\r\n\r\nGABRIEL PLATTES, who (Harte says) \"had a bold, adventurous cast of\r\nmind.\" The author of \"Herefordshire Orchards,\" calls him \"a singular\r\nhonest man.\" Mr. Weston says, \"This author may be considered as an\r\noriginal genius in husbandry. This ingenious writer, whose labours were\r\nproductive of plenty and riches to others, was so destitute of the\r\ncommon necessaries of life, as to perish with hunger and misery. He was\r\nfound dead in the streets, without a shirt to cover him, to the eternal\r\ndisgrace of the government he lived under. He bequeathed his papers to\r\nS. Hartlib, whom a contemporary author addresses in this manner: 'none\r\n(but yourself, who wants not an enlarged heart, but a fuller hand to\r\nsupply the world's defect,) being found, with some few others, to\r\nadminister any relief to a man of so great merit.' Another friend of\r\nHartlib's, gives Plattes the following character: 'certainly that man\r\nhad as excellent a genius in agriculture, as any that ever lived in this\r\nnation before him, and was the most faithful seeker of his ungrateful\r\ncountry's good. I never think of the great judgement, pure zeal, and\r\nfaithful intentions of that man, and withal of his strange sufferings,\r\nand manner of death, but am struck with amazement, that such a man\r\nshould be suffered to fall down dead in the streets for want of food,\r\nwhose studies tended in no less than providing and preserving food for\r\nwhole nations, and that with as much skill and industry, so without\r\npride or arrogance towards God or man.'--A list of his many works\r\nappears in Watts's Bibl. Brit. and also in Weston's intelligent\r\nCatalogue; and much information is given of Plattes in vol. 2 of the\r\nCensura Litteraria. Two of his works appear to be,\r\n\r\n     1. Treatise of Husbandry; 1633, 4to.\r\n\r\n     2. Discourse of Infinite Treasure, hidden since the World's\r\n     beginning, in the way of Husbandry; 1632, 1653, 1656, 4to.[29]\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM LAWSON published in 1597, A New Orchard and Garden, in 4to.\r\nOther editions, in 4to., in 1623, and 1626. His singular assertions are\r\ntreated with great candor by the author of _Herefordshire\r\nOrchards_,--\"for I thought I found many signs of honesty and integrity\r\nin the man, a sound, clear, natural wit.\"\r\n\r\nSIMON HARWARD published in 1597, a Treatise on the Art of propagating\r\nVegetables; and annexed it to Lawson's New Orchard and Garden,\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JOHNSON, the learned editor of the enlarged and valuable edition\r\nof Gerarde. Wood calls him \"the best herbalist of his time.\" Mr.\r\nWeston, in his Catalogue, relates with great pleasure, the sanguine and\r\ninteresting tours which Mr. Johnson, and some friends, made in various\r\ncounties, to examine the native botanical beauties of his own country.\r\n\r\nWood further informs us, that at the siege of Basinghouse, \"he\r\nreceived a shot in the shoulder, of which he died in a fortnight after;\r\nat which time his work did justly challenge funeral tears; being then no\r\nless eminent in the garrison for his valour and conduct as a soldier,\r\nthan famous through the kingdom for his excellency as an herbalist and\r\nphysician.\" I have given in a note below, his approbation of Parkinson's\r\nwork, merely to shew Mr. Johnson's liberal mind.[30]\r\n\r\nRALPH AUSTEN, published his Treatise of Fruit Trees, shewing the manner\r\nof Grafting, Planting, &c. with the spiritual use of an Orchard, or\r\nGarden, in divers similitudes. _Oxford_, 1653 and 1657, 4to. He appears\r\nto have lived and died at Oxford. He dedicates it to his friend S.\r\nHartlib, Esq. Worlidge says, that in this treatise Austen hath \"very\r\ncopiously set forth the high applauses, dignities, advantages, and\r\nvariety of pleasures and contents, in the planting and enjoyment of\r\nfruit trees.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS AUSTEN, published in 1631, Observations on Sir Francis Bacon's\r\nNatural History, so far as concerns Fruit trees, 4to.

Mr. Weston, in his\r\ninteresting Catalogue, says, \"It is remarked in the Phil. Trans. that\r\nEngland has profited in agriculture to the amount of many millions, in\r\nconsequence of the Flanders husbandry having been made known by this\r\nlittle treatise. In another edition (I believe 1655) Hartlib, in order\r\nto enlarge, and better explain it, annexed Dr. Beatie's Annotations to\r\nit.\" Mr. Hartlib also published,\r\n\r\n     1, Legacie; or an Enlargement of the Discourse of Husbandry; 4to.\r\n     1650.

The author was an aged minister\r\n     of the Gospel, at Lovingland, near Yarmouth.\"\r\n\r\n     4, The Commonwealth of Bees, 1657.\r\n\r\nMr. Weston gives much information respecting Mr. Hartlib. I select only\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n\"He was a German gentleman by birth, a great promoter of husbandry\r\nduring the times of the commonwealth, and much esteemed by all ingenious\r\nmen in those days, particularly by Milton, who addressed to him his\r\nTreatise on Education; Sir William Petty also inscribed two letters to\r\nhim on the same subject. _Lond._ 4to. 1647 and 1648. Cromwell, who was a\r\ngreat favourer of agriculture, in consequence of this admirable\r\nperformance, allowed Hartlib a pension of L100. a year; and Hartlib\r\nafterwards, the better to fulfil the intentions of his benefactor,\r\nprocured Dr. Beatie's excellent annotations on the Legacy, with other\r\nvaluable pieces from his numerous correspondents. This famous work,\r\nattributed to Hartlib, and called the Legacy, was only drawn up at his\r\nrequest, and, passing through his correction and revision, was published\r\nby him.\" His name will ever stand honoured, from Milton having\r\ndedicated his _Tractate on Education_ to him, and from his having, in\r\nthis tract, painted with affection, and with warm and high colours, the\r\ncharacter of Mr. Hartlib.[31]\r\n\r\nDr. JOHN BEALE, author of that celebrated little tract, the\r\n\"Herefordshire Orchards, a pattern for the whole of England.\" _London_\r\n1657, 12mo.; 1724, 8vo. He addresses this to Mr. Hartlib, and thus\r\ncommences it:--\"Your industrious endeavours for the benefit of all men,\r\nand particularly for the good of this nation, hath well deserved the\r\ngrateful acknowledgement of all good men, and of my self in special; for\r\nthat in my rural retirement I have received some profit, and very much\r\ninnocent and refreshing delights in the perusal of those treatises,\r\nwhich are by your diligent hand communicated to the publick.\" He thus\r\naffectionately concludes it:--\"I briefly hint unto you what esteem we do\r\ntruly owe unto your labours. I pray the Lord to remember your diligence\r\nin the great day of his appearance in glory. Your hearty well-wisher.\"\r\nIn vol. 6 of the works of the Honourable Robert Boyle, are many letters\r\nfrom Dr. Beale. That dated Oct. 26, strongly paints his attachment to\r\nthe fruits of Herefordshire, or whatever may tend to the benefit of that\r\nhis native county. Mr. Boyle says of him, \"There is not in life, a man\r\nin this whole island, nor on the continents beyond the seas, that could\r\nbe made more universally useful to do good to all.\" And Mr. Gough, in\r\nhis Topography, records the benefits he conferred on that county. Such a\r\ntestimony as the above, from such a man as Mr. Boyle, is, indeed,\r\nhonourable. The learned Boerhaave tells us who Mr. Boyle was: \"Boyle,\r\nthe ornament of his age and country, succeeded to the genius and\r\nenquiries of the great Verulam. Which of all Boyle's writings shall I\r\nrecommend? All of them. To him we owe the secrets of fire, air, water,\r\nanimals, vegetables, fossils, so that from his works may be reduced the\r\nwhole system of natural knowledge.\" His charities amounted to L1000.\r\nannually. Dr. Beale resided chiefly at Hereford, (1660) when he was made\r\nRector of Yeovil, Somersetshire, where he died in 1683, at the age of\r\neighty. His other works are enumerated in Mr. Loudon's Encyclopaedia of\r\nGardening. Mr. Evelyn, in the greatest of his works, (his Sylva,) adds\r\nto it Dr. Beale's advertisement concerning Cyder.\r\n\r\nWilliam Brome, a principal ornament of Christ Church, a native of\r\nHerefordshire, and who afterwards lived in retirement at Ewithington, in\r\nthat county, \"formed the plan (says the late Mr. Dunster in his edition\r\nof Phillips's Cyder) of writing the Provincial History of his native\r\ncounty, a work for which he was eminently qualified, not only by his\r\ngreat and general learning, but as being particularly an excellent\r\nnaturalist and antiquary. After having made a considerable progress, he\r\nabandoned his design, and, which is still more to be lamented, destroyed\r\nthe valuable materials which he had collected.\" I merely introduce this\r\nto state, that from Mr. Brome, much information, in all likelihood,\r\nmight have been gathered respecting Dr. Beale. We have to regret, that\r\ntime and mortality, have now obliterated every fading trace of\r\ncontemporary recollection of a man, who, in his day, was so highly\r\nesteemed.[32]\r\n\r\nROBERT SHARROCK, Archdeacon of Winchester, and Rector of Bishop's\r\nWaltham, and of Horewood. Wood, in his Athenae, says, \"he was accounted\r\nlearned in divinity, in the civil and common law, and very knowing in\r\nvegetables, and all appertaining thereunto. He published The History of\r\nthe Propagation and Improvement of Vegetables, by the concurrence of art\r\nand nature. _Oxford_, 1660, 8vo., and 1672, 8vo.: an account of which\r\nbook you may see in the Phil. Trans. No. 84, page 5002.\" He also\r\npublished Improvements to the Art of Gardening; or an exact Treatise on\r\nPlants. _London_, 1694; folio. This must have been a posthumous work, as\r\nhe died in 1684.\r\n\r\n---- ILIFFE, in 1670, published in 12mo. The compleat Vineyard.\r\n\r\nJOHN REA, the author of \"Flora, Ceres, and Pomona.\" It is enriched by a\r\nfrontispiece engraved by D. Loggan. He dedicates the above folio, in\r\n1665, to Lord Gerard, of Gerard's Bromley. His lordship, it seems, about\r\nthat time, determined to erect that noble mansion, which Plot has given\r\nus a plate of; and Rea, in this folio, enumerates those plants, fruits,\r\nand flowers, which he thinks this then-intended garden ought to be\r\nfurnished with; and a small bit, or a piece or parcel, of which once\r\nmost sumptuous garden, Plot gives us. \"Altho' (says Rea) our country\r\ncannot boast the benignity of that beautiful planet which meliorates\r\ntheir fruit in Italy, France, and Spain; yet, by reflection from good\r\nwalks, well gravelled walks, the choice of fit kinds, we may plentifully\r\npartake the pleasure, and yearly enjoy the benefit, of many delicious\r\nfruits: as also the admiration and delight in the infinite varieties of\r\nelegant forms, various colours, and numerous kinds of noble plants, and\r\nbeautiful flowers, some whereof have been heretofore handled by a\r\nrenowned person of your name; but since his time, nature hath discovered\r\nmany new varieties, not known to former ages, as I hope shortly will\r\nappear in your own collections, gloriously adorning your spacious\r\ngarden, which I wish may correspond, both in fashion and furniture, with\r\nthat noble structure to which it appertaineth. Accept then, my honoured\r\nlord, this humble offering, which may possibly live to do you service,\r\nwhen I am dust and ashes, and, according to my highest ambition, remain\r\nas a testimony of my sincerest gratitude for the many favours I have\r\nreceived from your honour, your most accomplished lady, and that noble\r\nfamily from whence she is descended. I should here add my prayers for\r\nyour honour's preservation, did I not reserve them for my morning\r\nsacrifice, daily to be presented to the immortal deities by him that\r\nis, your most humble and most devoted servant, John Rea.\" He addresses\r\nalso a long poem to Lady Gerard, on Flora inviting her to walk in this\r\ngarden, in which he celebrates her \"bright beauty.\"\r\n\r\n   Self-loved _Narcissus_, if he look\r\n   On your fair eyes, will leave the brook,\r\n   And undeceived, soon will rue\r\n   He ever any loved but you.\r\n   If to the _hyacinth_ you turn,\r\n   He smiles, and quite forgets to mourn.\r\n   The enamoured _heliotrope_ will run\r\n   To your bright stars, and leave the sun.\r\n   Our _lilies_ here do make no show,\r\n   They whiter on your bosom grow,\r\n   And _violets_ appear but stains,\r\n   Compared with your bluer veins.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   New-blown buds, all scents excelling,\r\n   As you pass by, invite your smelling.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   Mark the glorious _tulips_ rise\r\n   In various dress, to take your eyes,\r\n   And how the fairest and all the rest\r\n   Strive which shall triumph on your breast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   Thus your rich beauty and rare parts\r\n   Excel all flowers, exceed all arts.\r\n   Live then, sweet lady, to inherit\r\n   Your father's fortune, and his spirit,\r\n   Your mother's face and virtuous mind.[33]\r\n\r\nThroughout this long poem, John Rea's warmth much exceeds that of the\r\nmost romantic lovers. One of the latter only observes, that the flowers\r\ncourted the tread of his fair one's foot; that the sky grew more\r\nbeautiful in her presence, and that the atmosphere borrowed new\r\nsplendour from her eyes. Rea's passion seems even warmer than this. In\r\nhis address to the reader, he says, \"I have continued my affection to\r\nthis honest recreation, without companion or encouragement; and now in\r\nmy old age, (wearied and weaned from other delights) find myself more\r\nhappy in this retired solitude, than in all the bustles and busie\r\nemployments of my passed days.\" He thus concludes his book:--\r\n\r\n              ---- this is all I crave:\r\n   Some gentle hand with flowers may strew my grave,\r\n   And with one sprig of bays my herse befriend,\r\n   When as my life, as now my book, doth end.\r\n\r\n   Laus Deo.\r\n\r\nRea gives us also another very long poem, being that of \"Flora to the\r\nLadies,\" which he thus concludes:--\r\n\r\n   Silent as flow'rs may you in virtues grow,\r\n   Till rip'ning time shall make you fit to blow,\r\n   Then flourish long, and seeding leave behind\r\n   A numerous offspring of your dainty kind;\r\n   And when fate calls, have nothing to repent,\r\n   But die like flow'rs, virtuous and innocent.\r\n   Then all your fellow flow'rs, both fair and sweet,\r\n   Will come, with tears, to deck your winding-sheet;\r\n   Hang down their pensive heads so dew'd, and crave\r\n   To be transplanted to your perfum'd grave.\r\n\r\nThese love poems seem all to have been written in his old age; and that\r\npassion causes him thus to open his first book:--\"Love was the inventor,\r\nand is still the maintainer, of every noble science. It is chiefly that\r\nwhich hath made my flowers and trees to flourish, though planted in a\r\nbarren desert, and hath brought me to the knowledge I now have in plants\r\nand planting; for indeed it is impossible for any man to have any\r\nconsiderable collection of plants to prosper, unless he love them: for\r\nneither the goodness of the soil, nor the advantage of the situation,\r\nwill do it, without the master's affection; it is that which renders\r\nthem strong and vigorous; without which they will languish and decay\r\nthrough neglect, and soon cease to do him service. I have seen many\r\ngardens of the new model, in the hands of unskilful persons, with good\r\nwalls, walks and grass-plots; but in the most essential adornments so\r\ndeficient, that a green meadow is a more delightful object; there nature\r\nalone, without the aid of art, spreads her verdant carpets,\r\nspontaneously embroidered with many pretty plants and pleasing flowers,\r\nfar more inviting than such an immured nothing. And as noble fountains,\r\ngrottoes, statues, &c. are excellent ornaments and marks of\r\nmagnificence, so all such dead works in gardens, ill done, are little\r\nbetter than blocks in the way to intercept the sight, but not at all to\r\nsatisfy the understanding. A choice collection of living beauties, rare\r\nplants, flowers and fruits, are indeed the wealth, glory, and delight of\r\na garden.\" He seems enamoured with tulips. He describes no less than one\r\nhundred and ninety different sorts. He calls them \"Flora's choicest\r\njewels, and the most glorious ornaments of the best gardens. Such is\r\ntheir rarity and excellence, and so numerous are the varieties, that it\r\nis not possible any one person in the world should be able to express,\r\nor comprehend the half of them, every new spring discovering many new\r\ndiversities never before observed, either arising from the seeds of some\r\nchoice kinds, the altering of off-sets, or by the busy and secret\r\nworking of nature upon several self-colours, in different soils and\r\nsituations, together with the help of art.\"[34] Switzer says, \"the\r\npractical and plain method in which he has delivered his precepts, are\r\nadmirable.\" There is a second edition of the Flora, _with additions_.\r\nWhat these are, I know not; unless they are the cuts of parterres, which\r\nwere omitted in the first edition. There is an edition in 1696.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN WORLIDGE published his Systema Agriculturae in folio, 1668; second\r\nedition in 1675, folio: fourth edition in 1687, folio. An octavo edition\r\n1716, with its English title of \"A compleat System of Husbandry and\r\nGardening, or the Gentleman's Companion in the Business and Pleasures of\r\na Country life.\" In the preface to this, and indeed throughout all his\r\nworks, we may trace his fondness for gardens. The great variety of rural\r\nsubjects treated on in this book, may be seen in its Index, or full\r\nAnalysis. In his second section \"Of the profits and pleasures of\r\nfruit-trees,\" he strongly enforces the planting of vineyards.\r\n\r\nHis Systema Horticulturae, or the Art of Gardening, was published in\r\n1677, 8vo.; a third edition 1688; a fourth edition 1719.\r\n\r\nVinetum Britannicum, or a Treatise on Cyder, and other Wines and Drinks,\r\nextracted from Fruits: to which is added, a Discourse on Bees; 8vo.,\r\n_second impression, much enlarged_, 1678. He therein thus paints the\r\npleasures of a garden:--\"The exercises of planting, grafting, pruning,\r\nand walking in them, very much tendeth to salubrity, as also doth the\r\nwholesome airs found in them, which have been experienced not only to\r\ncure several distempers incident to our nature, but to tend towards the\r\nprolongation of life. For nothing can be more available to health and\r\nlong life, than a sedate quiet mind, attended with these rural delights,\r\na healthful air, and moderate exercise, which may here be found in all\r\nseasons of the year.\"\r\n\r\nHe also published, The Second Parts of Systema Agriculturae, 8vo. 1689.\r\n\r\nThe Second Part of Vinetum Britannicum, 8vo. 1689. This is usually bound\r\nwith the above.\r\n\r\nHis attachment to whatever concerns a rural life, shines through most of\r\nhis pages. Take the few following for a specimen:--\r\n\r\nIn his description of the month of _April_, he says, \"In this month your\r\ngarden appears in its greatest beauty, the blossoms of the fruit-trees\r\nprognosticate the plenty of fruits for all the succeeding summer months,\r\nunless prevented by untimely frosts or blights. The bees now buz in\r\nevery corner of your garden to seek for food; the birds sing in every\r\nbush, and the sweet nightingale tunes her warbling notes in your\r\nsolitary walks, whilst the other birds are at their rest. The beasts of\r\nthe woods look out into the plains, and the fishes of the deep sport\r\nthemselves in the shallow waters. The air is wholesome, and the earth\r\npleasant, beginning now to be cloathed in nature's best array, exceeding\r\nall art's glory. This is the time that whets the wits of several nations\r\nto prove their own country to have been the _Garden of Eden_, or the\r\nterrestrial paradise, however it appears all the year besides. In case\r\nunseasonable weather hinders not, the pleasantness and salubrity of the\r\nair now tempts the sound to the free enjoyment of it, rather than to\r\nenjoy the pleasures of _Bacchus_ in a smoaky corner.\" In his month of\r\n_May_, he says, \"He that delights not in physick, let him now exercise\r\nhimself in the _garden_, and take the smell of the earth with the rising\r\nsun, than which to the virtuously inclined, there is nothing more\r\npleasant; for now is nature herself full of mirth, and the senses stored\r\nwith delights, and variety of pleasures.\" His month of _July_ thus\r\nrecommends itself: \"Grotts and shady groves are more seasonable to\r\nrecreate yourself in than the open air, unless it be late in the\r\nevening, or early in the morning, to such that can afford time to take a\r\nnap after noon.\"\r\n\r\nIn his Syst. Hort. he observes, that \"A fair stream or current flowing\r\nthrough or near your _garden_, adds much to the glory and pleasure of\r\nit: on the banks of it you may plant several aquatick exoticks, and have\r\nyour seats or places of repose under their umbrage, and there satiate\r\nyourself with the view of the curling streams, and its nimble\r\ninhabitants. These gliding streams refrigerate the air in a summer\r\nevening, and render their banks so pleasant, that they become resistless\r\ncharms to your senses, by the murmuring noise, the undulation of the\r\nwater, the verdant banks and shades over them, the sporting fish\r\nconfined within your own limits, the beautiful swans; and by the\r\npleasant notes of singing birds, that delight in groves, on the banks of\r\nsuch rivulets.\"[35]\r\n\r\nAnd in his preface to this last work, he says, \"My principal design\r\nbeing not only to excite or animate such as have fair estates, and\r\npleasant seats in the country, to adorn and beautifie them; but to\r\nencourage the honest and plain countryman in the improvement of his\r\nVille, by enlarging the bounds and limits of his _Gardens_, as well as\r\nhis _Orchards_, for the encrease of such esculent plants as may be\r\nuseful and beneficial to himself and his neighbors.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS DROPE, B. D., who died at Oxford, and whose father was Vicar of\r\nCumner, in Berkshire. Wood, in his Athenae, says, \"he hath written on a\r\nsubject which he much delighted in, and wherein he spent much time, but\r\nwhich was not published till his death: A short and sure guide to the\r\npractice of raising, and ordering of fruit trees, _Oxford_, 1672, 12mo.,\r\na large and laudable account of which you may see in the Phil. Trans.\r\nNo. 86, p. 10, 49.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSES COOKE, Gardener to the Earl of Essex, at Cashiobury, afterwards a\r\npartner with Lucre, Field and London, in the Brompton Park Nursery. He\r\nwrote \"The Art of making Cyder,\" published in Mr. Evelyn's works. The\r\nmanner of raising Forest Trees, 4to. 1696. Other editions in 8vo. in\r\n1717, 1724, and 1770. Mr. Evelyn (speaking of Cashiobury) says, \"The\r\ngardens are very rare, and cannot be otherwise, having so skilful an\r\nartist to govern them as Cooke.\" Moses Cooke, in his preface, justly\r\nsays, \"Planting and Gardening add much to the health and content of man;\r\nand these two jewels no man that well understands himself, would\r\nwillingly be without; for it is not only set down for a certain truth by\r\nmany wise men, but confirmed by experience. The learned Lord Bacon\r\ncommends the following of the plough in fresh ground, to be very\r\nhealthful for man; but more, the digging in gardens.\" His pages, here\r\nand there, record some of \"the fine stately trees that we have growing\r\nin the woods at Cashiobury.\" Cooke unfortunately fancied himself a poet;\r\nbut gratitude to his noble master, and loyalty to his king, seem to have\r\nbeen the motives of his inspiration. \"One night (methought) walking up\r\none of my Lord's lime-walks, I heard the grateful trees thus paying the\r\ntribute of their thanks to his lordship:--\r\n\r\n   Like pyramids our stately tops we'll raise,\r\n   To sing our noble benefactor's praise;\r\n   Freshly we will to after-ages show\r\n   What noble Essex did on us bestow:\r\n   For we our very being owe to him,\r\n   Or else we had long since intombed been\r\n   In crop of bird, or in beast's belly found,\r\n   Or met our death neglected on the ground.\r\n   By him we cherish'd were with dung and spade,\r\n   For which we'll recompense him with our shade.\r\n   And since his kindness saw us prun'd so well,\r\n   We will requite him with our fragrant smell;\r\n   In winter (as in gratitude is meet)\r\n   We'll strew our humble leaves beneath his feet.\r\n   Nay, in each tree, root, trunk, branch, all will be\r\n   Proud to serve him and his posterity.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he thus invokes the stately oak, after enumerating many of the rich\r\ncommodities which this tree bears through our Thames:--\r\n\r\n   Of silks and satins fine, to clothe the back;\r\n   Of wines, Italian, French, and Spanish sack.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   'T was faithful oak preserved our king, that we\r\n   Might thence learn lessons of true loyalty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   When in salt seas Sir Francis Drake did steer,\r\n   Sailing in oak he say'd one day i'th'year.\r\n   His oak, which the terrestrial globe did measure,\r\n   Through dangers led him t' honour, profit, pleasure.\r\n   No wood like oak that grows upon the ground,\r\n   To make our house and ships last long and sound;\r\n   No oak like ours: by love to oak let's then\r\n   Appear true subjects, and right Englishmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHONY LAWRENCE published in 4to. 1677, Nurseries, Orchards, Profitable\r\nGardens, and Vineyards Encouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN READ, \"one of the earliest Scotch gardening writers.\" He wrote \"The\r\nScotch Gardener,\" 1683, 4to. An Edinburgh edition in 8vo. 1766; to which\r\nis added, a short Treatise of Forest Trees, by the Earl of Haddington.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. GIBSON, who wrote A Short Account of several Gardens near London, as\r\nviewed in 1681, in vol. xii of the Archaeologia.\r\n\r\n\r\nT. LANGFORD wrote Plain and Full Instructions to raise all sorts of\r\nFruit Trees that prosper in England; with Directions for making Liquors\r\nof all sorts of Fruits; 8vo. 1681. To the second edition, in 1696, is\r\nprefixed a very handsome epistle from Mr. Evelyn, in which he says, \"As\r\nI know nothing extant that exceeds it, so nor do I of any thing which\r\nneeds be added to it.\" Also,\r\n\r\nThe Practical Planter of Fruit Trees; 8vo. 1681. Also, Systemae\r\nAgriculturae, being the Mystery of Husbandry Discovered; folio, 1681.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEONARD MEAGER'S Portrait perhaps we may not be very desirous to\r\ndiscover, when he tells his readers, neither to \"sow, plant, nor graft,\r\nor meddle with any thing relating to gardening, when the sun or moon is\r\neclipsed, or on that day, nor when the moon is afflicted by either of\r\nthe unfortunate planets, viz. Mars or Saturn.\"[36] His English Gardner,\r\nin 4to. with cuts, came out in 1683; the ninth edition came out in 1699,\r\n4to.; it contains several clearly pointed plates of knots, or parterres.\r\n\r\nMeager also published The New Art of Gardening, with the Gardener's\r\nAlmanack; 8vo. 1697; and\r\n\r\nThe Mystery of Husbandry; 12mo. 1699.\r\n\r\nThe many editions that came out of Meager's English Gardner,\r\nsufficiently shews the estimation in which his book was held.\r\n\r\nGEORGE LONDON and HENRY WISE, so eminent in their day, that, as a\r\ncontemporary says, \"If the stock of their nurseries at Brompton Park,\r\nwere valued at one penny a plant, the amount would exceed L40,000. Mr.\r\nEvelyn declares, that we may place the above nursery above the greatest\r\nworks of that kind ever seen or heard of, either in books or travels.\"\r\nMr. Evelyn again calls it \"that vast ample collection which I have\r\nlately seen, and well considered, at Brompton Park; the very sight of\r\nwhich alone, gives an idea of something that is greater than I can well\r\nexpress. One needs no more than to take a walk to Brompton Park, (on a\r\nfair morning) to behold and admire what a magazine these industrious men\r\nhave provided.\" The Rev. John Laurence, in his Clergyman's Recreation,\r\nwillingly attests their skill, integrity, and reputation, \"so well\r\nestablished amongst the nobility and gentry.\"\r\n\r\nMr. London's grateful apprentice, Switzer, thus affectionately and\r\nzealously records them in his History of Gardening, prefixed to his\r\nIconologia:--\"But now let us look amongst the nobility and gentry, which\r\nat this time were every where busied in making and adorning their\r\ngardens and plantations. To enumerate and set down the history of\r\ngardening in its several particulars in this reign, would require a\r\nvolume of itself, but will be for the most part summed up in the person\r\nand character of _George London, Esq._ Superintendent of their Majesties\r\ngardens, and Director-General of most of the gardens and plantations of\r\nGreat Britain. I am not well enough informed, neither is it material I\r\nshould go back to the birth and education of this eminent gardener; his\r\nindustry and natural parts soon and sufficiently recommended him to the\r\nnobility and gentry, that he was _courted and caressed by all_; so true\r\nit is, _That the gifts of nature are much more valuable than those of\r\noriginal birth and fortune, or even learning itself_. And to the eternal\r\nhonour of the present age be it spoken, never was virtue, laudable\r\nindustry, nor art more encouraged, of which the person we are here\r\nspeaking of is an undeniable instance. I shall content myself therefore\r\nto find him under the care and instruction of Mr. _Rose_ (whose\r\ncharacter has been already drawn). The early and vigorous appearances he\r\nmade in business were soon discovered by his master, who spared no\r\npains, nor hindered him of any liberty, whereby he might improve\r\nhimself. After he had been with him about four or five years, he sent\r\nhim (if I am right informed) into France, the great seat of learning at\r\nthat time in the world, especially in the errand he went about. Soon\r\nafter he returned, he was preferred to the Bishop of London's service\r\nbefore-mentioned; and, in a few years more, he (with his associates)\r\nentered on that great undertaking of Brompton Park; and upon the\r\nRevolution, was made superintendant of all their Majesties gardens, for\r\nwhich he had L200. a year, and a Page of the Back Stairs to Queen Mary.\r\nMr. London and Mr. Wise being joined partners, and thus, as it were,\r\nboth possessed of the royal favour, and the purses of the king, queen,\r\nand nobility, left no stone unturned to carry on their designs. Soon\r\nafter the peace of Reswyck, Mr. London took another journey into France,\r\nwith the Right Honourable the Earl of Portland, that was sent, by King\r\nWilliam, Ambassador-Extraordinary on that occasion; and then it was that\r\nhe made those observations on the fruit gardens at Versailles, which are\r\npublished in the preface to their abridgement. After the death of the\r\nQueen, and not many years after her the King, their royal successor,\r\nQueen Anne, of pious memory, committed the care of her gardens in chief\r\nto Mr. Wise, Mr. London still pursuing his business in the country. It\r\nwill perhaps be hardly believed in time to come, that this one person\r\nactually saw and gave directions once or twice a year in most of the\r\nnoblemen's and gentlemen's gardens in England. And since it was common\r\nfor him to ride fifty or sixty miles in a day, he made his northern\r\ncircuit in five or six weeks, and sometimes less; and his western in as\r\nlittle time; as for the south and east, they were but three or four\r\ndays' work for him; most times twice a year visiting all the country\r\nseats, conversing with gentlemen, and forwarding the business of\r\ngardening in such a degree as is almost impossible to describe. In the\r\nmean time his colleague managed matters nearer home with a dexterity and\r\ncare equal to his character; and in truth they have deserved so much of\r\nthe world, that it is but common justice to transmit their memory to\r\nages to come. To speak more particularly of the knowledge Mr. London was\r\nsupposed to be master of in this matter, the little opportunity he had\r\nin laying a foundation of learning, was, without doubt, a great\r\nobstruction to his progress in occult philosophy, which is involved in\r\nso many hard terms; this, nevertheless, he overcame purely by industry;\r\nand what he wanted in one, he abounded with in the other. He was\r\nperfectly well skilled in fruit, which seemed to be his master-piece; as\r\nfor other parts, as greens, trees, flowers, exoticks, and the like, he\r\ncertainly had as much knowledge as any one man living; and though he\r\nmight not come up to the highest pitch of design always, yet that might\r\nbe attributed to the haste he was generally in; and it can be no great\r\nblemish to his character, that he was not the greatest person in every\r\nthing, when it is surprising to find he could possibly know so much; so\r\ngreat a surprise indeed, that we must hardly ever expect his equal, much\r\nless any one that will exceed him. The planting and raising of all sorts\r\nof trees is so much due to this undertaking, that it will be hard for\r\nany of posterity to lay their hands on a tree in any of these kingdoms,\r\nthat have not been a part of their care. Mr. London, by his great\r\nfatigues in heat and cold, notwithstanding naturally of a healthy,\r\nstrong constitution, was at last seized with an illness, which carried\r\nhim off after a few months' sickness. I shall take no other notice of\r\nhim than what relates to my purpose in gardening, in which he has left a\r\nlaudable example to all that shall have the encouragement to enter, and\r\nthe courage and strength to perform what he did. He died towards\r\nChristmas in the year 1713.\"\r\n\r\nIn the preface to his Iconologia, he again mentions them:--\"Had their\r\nleisure been equal to their experience, the world might from them have\r\nreasonably expected the compleatest System of Gardening that any age or\r\ncountry has produced. It is to them we owe most of those valuable\r\nprecepts in gardening now in use, and their memory ought to be\r\ntransmitted to posterity, with the same care as those of the greatest\r\nand most laborious philosophers and heroes, who by their writing and\r\npractice have deserved so well of the world.\"\r\n\r\nHe again mentions his old master, Mr. London:--\"In fine, he was the\r\nperson that refined the business and pleasure of kitchen and fruit\r\ngardens to a pitch beyond what was ever till that time seen, and more\r\nthan was thought possible for one man ever to do; and (till the\r\nsuccession of two eminent persons in these kingdoms, who have very much\r\noutstript him) has not had his fellow in any century that history gives\r\nus account of.\"\r\n\r\nSwitzer, speaking of Dr. Compton, Bishop of London, says, \"He was a\r\ngreat encourager of Mr. London, and probably very much assisted him in\r\nhis great designs. This reverend father was one of the first that\r\nencouraged the importation, raising and increase of exoticks, in which\r\nhe was the most curious man in that time, or perhaps will be in any\r\nage. He had above one thousand species of exotick plants in his stoves\r\nand gardens.\"\r\n\r\nNo monument has, I believe, been erected to Mr. London's memory,\r\ndeservedly eminent and esteemed as he was in his day, _courted and\r\ncaressed by all_, nor can I find out even where he was born or buried.\r\nIf one could obtain a resemblance of him, one hopes his Picture, or his\r\nBust, may not deserve the censure of our noble poet:\r\n\r\n   What is the end of fame? 'tis but to fill\r\n   A certain portion of uncertain paper;\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   To have, when the original is dust,\r\n   A name, a wretched _picture_, and worse _bust_.[37]\r\n\r\nThe two following works were published by them:--\r\n\r\nThe Complete Gardener, &c. by Mons. de la Quintinye. Now compendiously\r\nabridged, and made of more use; with very considerable Improvements. By\r\nGeorge London and Henry Wise. To which is prefixed, An Address to the\r\nNobility and Gentry, by J. Evelyn, Esq.; folio, 1693; octavo, 1699,\r\n1717. Seventh edition in 1719. There is a curious plate of a garden\r\nprefixed, and two neat ones at page 22. There are also other cuts. Mr.\r\nEvelyn wrote this Address purposely to recommend their \"extraordinary\r\nand rare industry.\" And he also wrote the Preliminary Discourse to that\r\npart which relates to Fruit-trees, wherein he thus breaks out:--\"Let us\r\nbut take a turn or two in a well-contrived and planted garden; and see\r\nwhat a surprising scene presents itself in the vernal bloom, diffusing\r\nits fragrant and odoriferous wafts, with their ravishing sweets; the\r\ntender blossoms curiously enamelled; the variously-figured shapes of the\r\nverdant foliage, dancing about, and immantling the laden branches of the\r\nchoicest fruit; some hiding their blushing cheeks; others displaying\r\ntheir beauties, and even courting the eye to admire; others the hand to\r\ngather, and all of them to taste their delicious pulps. Can any thing be\r\nmore delightful, than to behold an ample square (in a benign aspect)\r\ntapestried and adorned with such a glorious embroidery of festoons, and\r\nfruitages, depending from the yielding boughs, pregnant with their\r\noffspring, and pouring forth their plenty and store, as out of so many\r\nAmalthean horns? Some tinctured with the loveliest white and red; others\r\nan azurine-purple; others striped with an incarnadine, as over a tissue\r\nof vegetable gold. Colours of an oriency, that mock the pencil of the\r\nmost exquisite artist; and with which their native beauty, perfume,\r\nfragrancy, and taste, gratify and entertain more senses at once, than\r\ndoes any sublunary object in all unvitiated nature besides.\"\r\n\r\nTheir other Work was thus announced in one of the original numbers of\r\nthe Spectator, which came out in small folio weekly numbers, and a\r\nportion of each number was appropriated to advertisements. It was thus\r\nadvertised in that of May 5th, 1711:--\"The Retired Gardener. Vol. i.\r\nBeing a Translation of Le Jardinier Solitaire; or, Dialogues between a\r\nGentleman and a Gardener: containing the methods of making, ordering,\r\nand improving a fruit and kitchen garden; together with the manner of\r\nplanting and cultivating flowers, plants, and shrubs, necessary for the\r\nadorning of gardens, &c. Vol. ii. containing the manner of planting and\r\ncultivating all sorts of flowers, plants, and shrubs, necessary for the\r\nadorning of gardens; in which is explained, the art of making and\r\ndisposing of parterres, arbours of greens, wood works, arches, columns,\r\nand other pieces and compartments usually found in the most beautiful\r\ngardens of country seats. The whole enriched with variety of Figures,\r\nbeing a Translation from the Sieur Louis Liger. To this volume is added,\r\na Description and Plan of Count Tallard's Garden, at Nottingham. The\r\nwhole revised by George London and Henry Wise. Printed for Jacob Tonson,\r\nat Shakspeare's Head, over against Catherine-street in the Strand.\" This\r\nbook, after giving the mode of culture of most flowers, generally gives\r\nwhat the author calls _its history_. I will merely give its history of\r\none flower:--\"On a day when they were keeping holiday in heaven, Flora\r\nsummoned all the deities that preside over gardens, and, when they were\r\nmet, addressed herself to them in this manner: 'You, who have always\r\nbeen the shining ornaments of my court, I have now called together, to\r\nconsult in a matter of great importance. I know I am the sovereign of\r\nall the flowery kind; but for the more firm establishment of my empire,\r\nI am thinking to choose them a Queen of a spotless and unblemished\r\nreputation; but will do nothing of this nature without your counsel and\r\nassistance.' To these words, all the deities that were present, having\r\nfirst filled the court with murmurs, answered in this manner: 'Great\r\ngoddess, be pleased to reflect a little on the animosities such a choice\r\nmay create among the rival flowers; even the worthless Thistle will\r\npretend to deserve the crown, and if denied, will perhaps grow factious,\r\nand disturb your peaceful reign.' 'Your fears are groundless,' replied\r\nthe goddess; 'I apprehend no such consequence; my resolution is already\r\nfixed; hear, therefore, what I have determined:--In the deep recesses of\r\na wood, where formerly the oaks were vocal, and pronounced oracles to\r\nmortals, at the foot of a little hill is a grotto, whose structure is\r\nnature's master-piece, there a wood nymph passed her quiet days; she was\r\nextremely beautiful, and charmed all that beheld her; her looks, her\r\nmien, and her behaviour had something of more than human; and indeed she\r\nwas the daughter of a Dryad, and of a sylvan god. Her chastity and\r\ndevotion equalled her beauty, she was perfectly resigned to the will of\r\nheaven, and never undertook any thing without having first implored our\r\nassistance; her heart was pure, and her hands undefiled. This nymph is\r\ndead, and my intention is to raise a flower from her precious remains,\r\nto be Queen of all the flowery race. The applauding gods straight\r\nprepared for the ceremony; _Priapus_ put on a grave countenance;\r\n_Vertumnus_ loaded himself with perfumes of an excellent scent; _Pomona_\r\nheaped up canisters with all sorts of richest fruits; _Venus_ was\r\nattended with a train of smiles and graces; _Vesta_ promised wonders;\r\nand _Bacchus_ supplied rivers of nectar, and crowned vast goblets with\r\nthat divine liquor. In this equipage they left their celestial mansions,\r\nand repaired to the grotto, where they saw the dead body of the nymph\r\nstretched along on a soft couch of turf, and approaching it with\r\nprofound awe and silence, prepared to pay the sacred rites; and Flora,\r\nhaving thrice bowed herself to the ground, was heard to pronounce this\r\nprayer:--'Almighty Jupiter, great ruler of the universe, exert thy\r\ncreating power, and from the dead corpse of this lovely nymph let a\r\nplant arise, and bear no less lovely flowers, to be Queen of all thou\r\nhast already created.' Scarce had she made an end, when, behold a\r\nwondrous change! The nymph's extended limbs were turned into branches,\r\nand her hair into leaves; a shrub sprung up, adorned with sprouting\r\nbuds, which straight unfolding, disclosed a fragrant and vermilion\r\nflower; a sudden light filled all the grotto, and the well-pleased\r\ngoddess breathed thrice on the new-born babe, to spread it into life,\r\nand give it an odorous soul. Then seeing the vegetable Queen adorned\r\nwith every grace, she kissed her thrice, and, breaking the general\r\nsilence, revealed her secret joy. 'Approach,' said she, 'at my command,\r\noh, all ye flowers, and pay your grateful homage to your Queen, the\r\nROSE, for that is the name I give her.' Then taking a crown in her hand,\r\nthat had been made on purpose in heaven, she placed it on the head of\r\nthe new-made majesty; while to complete the ceremony, the attending gods\r\nsung joyful _Io Paeans_, amidst a symphony of flutes, harps, and all\r\nother tuneful instruments, with which the air resounded, while Flora and\r\nher bright celestial train ascended back rejoicing into heaven.\"[38]\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN JAMES, who translated Le Blond's \"Theory and Practice of Gardening,\r\nwherein is fully handled all that relates to fine gardens, commonly\r\ncalled Pleasure-gardens,\" cuts, 4to. 1712.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. STEVENSON published in small 4to. 1661, a book called The Twelve\r\nMonths, being a Treatise on Husbandry and Gardening.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. HENRY STEVENSON, of East Retford, published \"The Young\r\nGardener's Director,\" 1716, 12mo. He has introduced Mr. Evelyn's advice\r\nas to having salads in each month. There is a neat cut of flower-knots,\r\nand the frontispiece exhibits a curious old garden. In the preface he\r\nsays, \"not to mention the profit to a family, nothing conduces more to a\r\nman's health, especially to one that lives a sedentary life. If these\r\nobservations and experiments I have made in gardening, be of use to any\r\nby drawing him to a way of diversion that will preserve his health, and\r\nperhaps put him upon a meditation on the great works of the creation,\r\nlet him give the Creator the praise.\" He also published \"The Gentleman\r\nGardener Instructed;\" eighth edition, 12mo. 1769.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID STEVENSON, in 1746, published in 12mo. The Gentleman Gardener\r\nInstructed. Is this the same book as the above?\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN SWITZER, of whose private history so very little is known, but\r\nwhose works shew him to have been an honest, unassuming, humane,\r\nreligious, most industrious, and ingenious man. We only know that he had\r\na garden on Milbank, and another _near_ Vauxhall; and that he died, I\r\nbelieve, about 1745. He dates his Letter on the Cythesis, from New\r\nPalace Yard, 1730. He was a native of _Hampshire_; for in his Fruit\r\nGardener, speaking of walnut-trees, he says, \"The best I ever saw are\r\nthose that grow upon chalk. Such are those that grow about _Ewell_, near\r\n_Epsom_, and in many places of my own native county of _Hampshire_,\r\nthere being one cut down some few years ago in the Park belonging to the\r\nRight Honourable the Lady _Russell_, at _Stratton_, that did spread, at\r\nleast, fifty yards diameter.\" He acknowledges, without murmuring, his\r\nmeanness of fortune, and his having industriously submitted \"to the\r\nmeanest labours of the scythe, spade, and wheel-barrow.\" He became,\r\nhowever, eminent in his day, and added much to the beauty and\r\nmagnificence of the gardens of many of our chief nobility and gentry. He\r\nwrote a history of the art he so loved, and therefore his classic\r\nHistory of Gardening, prefixed to his Ichnographia Rustica, merits the\r\nperusal of every one attached to gardens; and paints in strong colours\r\nhis own devotion to that art; and which he thus concludes:--\"In short,\r\nnext to the more immediate duties of religion, 'tis in the innocency of\r\nthese employs, thus doing, thus planting, dressing, and busying\r\nthemselves, that all wise and intelligent persons would be found, when\r\nDeath, the king of terrors, shall close their eyes, and they themselves\r\nbe obliged to bid an eternal farewell to these and all other sublunary\r\npleasures;\" and he who was thus fond of breathing the sweet and fragrant\r\nair of gardens, thus expresses his own (perhaps expiring) wish in the\r\nlines of Cowley:\r\n\r\n   Sweet shades, adieu! here let my dust remain,\r\n   Covered with flowers, and free from noise and pain;\r\n   Let evergreens the turfy tomb adorn,\r\n   And roseate dews (the glory of the morn)\r\n   My carpet deck; then let my soul possess\r\n   The happier scenes of an eternal bliss.\r\n\r\nHe asks \"What solid pleasure is there not to be found in gardening? Its\r\npursuit is easy, quiet, and such as put neither the body nor mind into\r\nthose violent agitations, or precipitate and imminent dangers that many\r\nother exercises (in themselves very warrantable) do. The end of this is\r\nhealth, peace, and plenty, and the happy prospect of felicities more\r\ndurable than any thing in these sublunary regions, and to which this is\r\n(next to the duties of religion) the surest path.\" His attachment to\r\nsome of our own poets, and to the classic authors of antiquity,\r\ndiscovers itself in many of his pages; and his devout turn of mind\r\nstrongly shines throughout. His allusion to Homer, in vol. iii. page 7,\r\nsufficiently shews how ardently this industrious servant, this barrow\r\nwheeler, must have searched the great writers of ancient times, to\r\ndiscover their attachment to rural nature, and to gardens. His candid\r\nand submissive mind thus speaks:--\"If we would, therefore, arrive at any\r\ngreater perfection than we are in gardening, we must cashiere that\r\nmathematical stiffness in our gardens, and imitate nature more; how that\r\nis to be done, will appear in the following chapters, which though they\r\nmay not be, as new designs scarce ever are, the most perfect, it will at\r\nleast excite some after-master to take pen and pencil in hand, and\r\nfinish what is here thus imperfectly begun, and this is my comfort, that\r\nI shall envy no man that does it. I have, God be praised, learned to\r\nadmire, and not envy every one that outgoes me: and this will, I hope,\r\ngo a great way in making me easy and happy under the pressures of a very\r\nnarrow fortune, and amidst the ruffles of an ill-natured world. I have\r\ntasted too severely of the lashes of man, to take any great\r\nsatisfaction in any thing but doing my duty.\"[39] In his devout and\r\nmagnificent Essay on the Sun, he says, \"'tis admirable that this planet\r\nshould, through so many ages of the world, maintain an uninterrupted\r\ncourse, that in so many thousands of revolving years, it should retain\r\nthe same light, heat, and vigour, and every morning renew its wonted\r\nalacrity, and dart its cherishing beams on these dull and gloomy scenes\r\nof melancholy and misery, and yet that so few of us rightly consider its\r\npower, or are thankful to Divine Omnipotence for it. The great Roscommon\r\n(not greater than good) speaks of it with divine transport, and exhorts\r\nmankind to admire it, from the benefits and celestial beams it displays\r\non the world:--\r\n\r\n   Great eye of all, whose glorious ray\r\n   Rules the bright empire of the day;\r\n   O praise his name, without whose purer light\r\n   Thou hadst been hid in an abyss of night.\"[40]\r\n\r\nSwitzer (as appears from the Preface to his Iconologia) was so struck\r\nwith the business and pleasures of a country life, that he collected, or\r\nmeant to collect, whatever he could respecting this subject, scattered\r\nup and down as they were in loose irregular papers and books; but this\r\nwork, we regret to say, never made its appearance. That he would have\r\ndone this well, may be guessed at from so many of his pages recording\r\nwhat he calls \"the eternal duration\" of Virgil's works, or those of \"the\r\nnoble and majestic\" Milton:--\r\n\r\n   Flowers worthy of Paradise, which no nice art\r\n   In beds, and curious knots, but nature boon\r\n   Pour'd forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain.\r\n\r\nThough prim regularity, and \"parterres embroidered like a petticoat,\"\r\nwere in his time in high vogue, yet his pages shew his enlarged views on\r\nthis subject, and the magnificent ideas he had formed, by surrounding\r\nthem by rural enclosures, (probably by reading Mr. Addison), perfumed\r\nwith blossoms, and bespangled with the rich tufts of nature. Nothing, he\r\nsays, is now so much wanted to complete the grandeur of the British\r\nnation, as noble and magnificent gardens, statues, and water-works; long\r\nextended shady walks, and groves, and the adjacent country laid open to\r\nview, and not bounded by high walls. The pleasant fields, and paddocks,\r\nin all the beautiful attire of nature, would then appear to be a part of\r\nit, and look as if the adjacent country were all a garden. Walls take\r\naway the rural aspect of any seat; wood, water, and such like, being the\r\nnoble and magnificent decorations of a country villa. Switzer calls\r\nwater the spirit and most enchanting beauty of nature. He is so struck\r\nwith \"the beautifulness and nobleness of terrace walks,\" and\r\nparticularly with that truly magnificent and noble one, belonging to the\r\nRight Honourable the Earl of Nottingham, at _Burleigh-on-the-Hill_, that\r\n\"for my own part I must confess, that that design creates an idea in my\r\nmind greater than I am well able to express.\" In his chapter of \"Woods\r\nand Groves,\" he enforces \"a particular regard to large old oaks, beech,\r\nand such like trees; in which case, one would as soon fire one's house,\r\nas cut them down, since it is the work of so many years, I may say ages,\r\nto rear them; those ancient trees which our forefathers had all along\r\npreserved with much care.\"[41] In some of the romantic embellishments\r\nwhich he proposed in the midst of a grove, or coppice, he hints at\r\nhaving \"little gardens, with caves, little natural cascades and grotts\r\nof water, with seats, and arbors of honeysuckles and jessamine, and, in\r\nshort, with all the varieties that nature and art can furnish.\" He\r\nadvises \"little walks and paths running through such pastures as adjoin\r\nthe gardens, passing through little paddocks, and corn fields, sometimes\r\nthrough wild coppices, and gardens, and sometimes by purling brooks, and\r\nstreams; places that are set off not by _nice art_, but by luxury of\r\nnature.\" And again, \"these hedge-rows mixed with primroses, violets, and\r\nsuch natural sweet and pleasant flowers; the walks that thus lead\r\nthrough them, will afford as much pleasure, nay, more so, than the\r\nlargest walk in the most magnificent and elaborate fine garden.\"[42] He\r\nconcludes his interesting Chapter of Woods and Coppices, with these\r\nlines of Tickell:--\r\n\r\n   Sweet solitude! when life's gay hours are past,\r\n   Howe'er we range, in thee we fix at last:\r\n   Tost thro' tempestuous seas, the voyage o'er,\r\n   Pale we look back, and bless the friendly shore.\r\n   Our own strict judges, our past life we scan,\r\n   And ask if glory have enlarg'd the span.\r\n   If bright the prospect, we the grave defy,\r\n   Trust future ages, and contented die.\r\n\r\nThe following appear to have been his works:--\r\n\r\n     1.

Mr. Lawrence\r\n     and Mr. Bradley, with their Two Letters of Recommendation.\r\n\r\nIn this later edition of 1731, are a few additions. In one of its\r\nconcluding chapters, he mentions \"my worthy and ingenious friend, Sir\r\nJames Thornhill.\" This pleasing volume, after stating the excellency of\r\nfruits, observes, \"if fruit trees had no other advantage attending them\r\nthan to _look_ upon them, how pleasurable would _that_ be? Since there\r\nis no flowering shrub excels, if equals that of a _peach_, or _apple\r\ntree_ in bloom. The tender enamelled blossoms, verdant foliage, with\r\nsuch a glorious embroidery of festoons and fruitages, wafting their\r\nodours on every blast of wind, and at last bowing down their laden\r\nbranches, ready to yield their pregnant offspring into the hands of\r\ntheir laborious planter and owner.\"[46]\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN TAVERNER published, in 1660, a little Treatise, called The Making\r\nof Fish Ponds, Breeding Fish, and _Planting Fruits_. Printed several\r\ntimes, says Wood, in his Athenae.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD BRADLEY. The Encyclopaedia of Gardening pronounces him \"a popular\r\nwriter of very considerable talent, and indefatigable industry;\" and\r\nspeaks highly of the interesting knowledge diffused through his very\r\nnumerous works, and gives a distinct list of them; so does Mr. Nicholls,\r\nin his Life of Bowyer; and Mr. Weston, in his Tracts, and Dr. Watts, in\r\nhis Bib. Britt. In Mr. Bradley's \"New Improvements of Planting and\r\nGardening,\" he has added the whole of that scarce Tract of Dr. Beale's,\r\nthe _Herefordshire Orchards_. One could wish to obtain his portrait,\r\nwere it only from his pen so well painting the alluring charms of\r\nflowers:--\"_Primroses_ and _Cowslips_, may be planted near the edges of\r\nborders, and near houses, for the sake of their pretty smell. I\r\nrecommend the planting some of the common sorts that grow wild in the\r\nwoods, in some of the most rural places about the house; for I think\r\nnothing can be more delightful, than to see great numbers of these\r\nflowers, accompanied with _Violets_, growing under the hedges, avenues\r\nof trees, and wilderness works. _Violets_, besides their beauty, perfume\r\nthe air with a most delightful odour.\"[47] Mr. Bradley, it appears, from\r\nthe Fruit Garden Kalendar, of the Rev. Mr. Lawrence, resided at Camden\r\nHouse, Kensington. They each of them in their letters, in 1717,\r\nsubscribe themselves, \"Your most affectionate friend.\" Mr. Lawrence\r\nfrequently styles him \"the most ingenious Mr. Bradley.\" Dr. Pulteney\r\nsays he \"was the author of more than twenty separate publications,\r\nchiefly on Gardening and Agriculture; published between the years 1716\r\nand 1730. His 'New Improvement of Planting and Gardening, both\r\nPhilosophical and Practical,' 8vo. 1717, went through repeated\r\nimpressions; as did his 'Gentleman's and Gardener's Kalendar,' (which\r\nwas the fourth part of the preceding book) both at home, and in\r\ntranslations abroad. His 'Philosophical Account of the Works of Nature,'\r\n4to. 1721, was a popular, instructive, and entertaining work, and\r\ncontinued in repute several years. The same may be said of his 'General\r\nTreatise of Husbandry and Gardening,' 8vo. 2 vols. 1726; and of his\r\n'Practical Discourses concerning the Four Elements, as they relate to\r\nthe Growth of Plants,' 8vo. 1727. His '_Dictionarium Botanicum_,' 8vo.\r\n1728, was, I believe, the first attempt of the kind in England.\" On the\r\nwhole (says Dr. Pulteney) Bradley's writings, coinciding with the\r\ngrowing taste for gardening, the introduction of exotics, and\r\nimprovements in husbandry, contributed to excite a more philosophical\r\nview of these arts, and diffuse a general and popular knowledge of them\r\nthroughout the kingdom.\"[48] Mr. Bradley has given at the end of his\r\ncurious \"Philosophical Account of the Works of Nature,\" which is\r\nembellished with neat engravings, a chapter \"Of the most curious Gardens\r\nin Europe, especially in Britain.\" In this chapter he justly observes,\r\nthat \"a gentle exercise in a fresh air, where the mind is engaged with\r\nvariety of natural objects, contributes to content; and it is no new\r\nobservation, that the trouble of the mind wears and destroys the\r\nconstitution even of the most healthful body. All kinds of gardens\r\ncontribute to health.\" This volume also preserves the account of Lord\r\nDucie's noted old chesnut tree at Tortworth, supposed to be more than a\r\nthousand years old; and of an elm belonging to his lordship, of a truly\r\ngigantic growth.[49] Switzer thus speaks of Bradley:--\"Mr. Bradley has\r\nnot only shewn himself a skilful botanist, but a man of experience in\r\nother respects, and is every where a modest writer.\" Mr. Bradley died in\r\n1732. Some writers have dwelt much upon his dissipation; let us\r\nremember, however, that\r\n\r\n   _Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues\r\n   We write in water._\r\n\r\nMr. Weston, in a communication inserted in the Gentleman's Magazine for\r\nNovember, 1806, says, \"Although this country had a great loss by the\r\ndeath of Evelyn, yet he was succeeded, in twenty years after, by another\r\nof equal abilities, and indefatigable in endeavouring to improve the art\r\nof gardening, as Bradley's numerous works will testify.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTIMOTHY NOURSE, whose \"Campania Foelix,\" 8vo. 1700, has prefixed to\r\nit, a very neat engraving by Vander Gucht, of rural life. He has\r\nchapters on Fruit Trees; on the several kinds of Apple Trees, and on\r\nCyder and Perry. In page 262 he, with great humanity, strongly pleads to\r\nacquit Lord Chancellor Bacon from the charge against him of corruption\r\nin his high office. His Essay \"Of a Country House,\" in this work, is\r\ncurious; particularly to those who wish to see the style of building,\r\nand the decorations of a country seat at that period. Mr. Nourse also\r\npublished \"A Discourse upon the Nature and Faculties of Man, with some\r\nConsiderations upon the Occurrences of Humane Life.\" Printed for Jacob\r\nTonson, at the Judge's Head, in Chancery-lane, 1686, 8vo. His chapter on\r\nSolitude, wherein he descants on the delights of rural scenery and\r\ngardens; and his conclusion, directing every man towards the attainment\r\nof his own felicity, are worth perusing. That on Death is forcibly\r\nwritten; he calls it \"no more than for a man to close up all the\r\ntravails, pains, and misfortunes of life, with one sweet and eternal\r\nsleep; he is now at everlasting rest; the fears and misery of poverty,\r\nthe anxieties of riches, the vexations of a process, do not devour him.\r\nHe does not fear the calumnies of the base, nor the frowns of the great.\r\n'Tis death which delivers the prisoner from his fetters, and the slave\r\nand captive from his chain; 'tis death which rescues the servant from\r\nthe endless toils of a laborious life, the poor from oppression, and\r\nmakes the beggar equal with princes. Here desperation finds a remedy,\r\nall the languors of disease, all the frustrations and tediousness of\r\nlife, all the infirmities of age, all the disquiets of the passions, and\r\nall the calamities of fortune, with whatever can make a man miserable,\r\nvanish in these shades.\" In his very curious \"Essay of a Country House,\"\r\nhe thus moralizes:--\"The variety of flowers, beautiful and fragrant,\r\nwith which his gardens are adorned, opening themselves, and dying one\r\nafter another, must admonish him of the fading state of earthly\r\npleasures, of the frailty of life, and of the succeeding generations to\r\nwhich he must give place. The constant current of a fountain, or a\r\nrivulet, must remind of the flux of time, which never returns.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL COLLINS, ESQ. of Archeton, Northamptonshire, author of \"Paradise\r\nRetrieved; 1717, 8vo. In the Preface to the Lady's Recreation, by\r\nCharles Evelyn, Esq. he is extremely severe on this \"Squire Collins,\"\r\nwhom he accuses of ignorance and arrogance.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN EVELYN, son of the author of _Sylva_. His genius early displayed\r\nitself; for when little more than fifteen, he wrote a Greek poem, which\r\nmust have some merit, because his father has prefixed it to the second\r\nedition of his _Sylva_. In Mr. Nicoll's Collection of Poems, are some by\r\nhim. There are two poems of his in Dryden's Miscellany. He translated\r\nPlutarch's Life of Alexander from the Greek; and the History of Two\r\nGrand Viziers, from the French. When only nineteen, he translated from\r\nthe Latin, Rapin on Gardens. He died in 1698. The Quarterly Review, in\r\nits review of Mr. Bray's Memoirs of Evelyn, thus speaks of this son, and\r\nof his father:--\"It was his painful lot to follow to the grave his only\r\nremaining son, in the forty-fourth year of his age, a man of much\r\nability and reputation, worthy to have supported the honour of his name.\r\nNotwithstanding these repeated sorrows, and the weight of nearly\r\nfourscore years, Evelyn still enjoyed uninterrupted health, and\r\nunimpaired faculties; he enjoyed also the friendship of the wise and the\r\ngood, and the general esteem beyond any other individual of his\r\nage.\"[50]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS FAIRCHILD, whose garden and vineyard at Hoxton, Mr. Bradley\r\nmentions in high terms, in numberless pages of his many works. I will\r\nmerely quote from one of his works, viz. from his Philosophical Account\r\nof the Works of Nature:--\"that curious garden of Mr. Thomas Fairchild,\r\nat Hoxton, where I find the greatest collection of fruits that I have\r\nyet seen, and so regularly disposed, both for order in time of ripening\r\nand good pruning of the several kinds, that I do not know any person in\r\nEurope to excel him in that particular; and in other things he is no\r\nless happy in his choice of such curiosities, as a good judgement and\r\nuniversal correspondence can procure.\" Mr. Fairchild published The City\r\nGardener; 8vo. 1722, price 1s. He corresponded with Linnaeus. He left\r\nfunds for a Botanical Sermon to be delivered annually at St. Leonard,\r\nShoreditch, on each Whitsun Tuesday, \"On the wonderful works of God in\r\nthe creation, or on the certainty of the resurrection of the dead,\r\nproved by the certain changes of the animal and vegetable parts of the\r\ncreation.\"[51] Dr. Pulteney thus speaks of Mr. Fairchild:--\"My plan does\r\nnot allow me to deviate so far as to cite authors on the subject of\r\ngardening, unless eminent for their acquaintance with English botany.\r\nSome have distinguished themselves in this way; and I cannot omit to\r\nmention, with applause, the names of Fairchild, Knowlton, Gordon, and\r\nMiller. The first of these made himself known to the Royal Society, by\r\nsome 'New Experiments relating to the different, and sometimes contrary\r\nmotion of the Sap;' which were printed in the Phil. Trans. vol. xxxiii.\r\nHe also assisted in making experiments, by which the sexes of plants\r\nwere illustrated, and the doctrine confirmed. Mr. Fairchild died in\r\nNovember, 1729.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE RICKETS, of Hoxton, was much noted about 1688 and 1689. Rea, in\r\nhis Flora, says of him, \"Mr. Rickets, of Hogsden, often remembered, the\r\nbest and most faithful florist now about London.\" Rea describes, in his\r\nFlora, one hundred and ninety different kinds of tulips, and says, \"All\r\nthese tulips, and _many others_, may be had of Mr. Rickets.\" Worlidge\r\nthus speaks of him:--\"he hath the greatest variety of the choicest\r\napples, pears, cherries, plums, apricots, peaches, malacolones,\r\nnoctorines, figgs, vines, currans, gooseberries, rasberries, mulberries,\r\nmedlars, walnuts, nuts, filberts, chesnuts, &c. that any man hath, and\r\ncan give the best account of their natures and excellencies.\" And again\r\nhe says, \"the whole nation is obliged to the industry of the ingenious\r\nMr. George Rickets, gardner at Hoxton or Hogsden without Bishopsgate,\r\nnear London, at the sign of the Hand there; who can furnish any planter\r\nwith all or most of the fruit trees before mentioned, having been for\r\nmany years a most laborious and industrious collector of the best\r\nspecies of all sorts of fruit from foreign parts. And hath also the\r\nrichest and most complete collection of all the great variety of\r\nflower-bearing trees and shrubs in the kingdom. That there is not a day\r\nin the year, but the trees, as well as the most humble plants, do there\r\nyield ornaments for Flora; with all sorts of curious and pleasant\r\nwinter-greens, that seemed to perpetuate the spring and summer, from the\r\nmost humble myrtle, to the very true cedar of Libanus. Not without\r\ninfinite variety of tulips, auriculaes, anemones, gillyflowers, and\r\nall other sorts of pleasant, and delicate flowers, that he may be truly\r\nsaid to be the master-flowrist of England; and is ready to furnish any\r\ningenious person with any of his choicest plants.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN COWEL appears to have been a noted gardener at Hoxton, about 1729.\r\nHe was the author of the \"Curious and Profitable Gardener.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHUGH STAFFORD, ESQ. of Pynes, in Devonshire, who published, in 1729, \"A\r\nTreatise on Cyder Making, with a Catalogue of Cyder Apples of Character;\r\nto which is prefixed, a Dissertation on Cyder, and Cyder-Fruit.\" Another\r\nedition in 1753.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN WHITMILL, Sen. and Jun. Gardeners at Hoxton, published the\r\nsixth edition, in small 8vo. of their \"Kalendarium Universale: or, the\r\nGardener's Universal Calendar.\" The following is part of their\r\nPreface:--\"The greatest persons, in all ages, have been desirous of a\r\ncountry retirement, where every thing appears in its native simplicity.\r\nThe inhabitants are religious, the fair sex modest, and every\r\ncountenance bears a picture of the heart. What, therefore, can be a more\r\nelegant amusement, to a good and great man, than to inspect the\r\nbeautiful product of fields and gardens, when every month hath its\r\npleasing variety of plants and flowers. And if innocence be our greatest\r\nhappiness, where can we find it but in a country life? In fields and\r\ngardens we have pleasures unenvied, and beauties unsought for; and any\r\ndiscovery for the improvement of them, is highly praiseworthy. In the\r\ngrowth of a plant, or a tree, we view the progress of nature, and ever\r\nobserve that all her works yield beauty and entertainment. To cultivate\r\nthis beauty, is a task becoming the wealthy, the polite, and the\r\nlearned; this is so generally understood, that there are few gentlemen\r\nof late, who are not themselves their chief gardeners. And it certainly\r\nredounds more to the honour and satisfaction of a gardener, that he is a\r\npreserver and pruner of all sorts of fruit trees, than it does to the\r\nhappiness of the greatest general that he has been successful in killing\r\nmankind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL TROWEL, of Poplar, published, in 1739, A New Treatise of\r\nHusbandry and Gardening; 12mo. 2s. 6d.

In\r\nthis Preface he also relates the origin of fruit gardens, by the\r\nhermits, and monastic orders. In his Introduction, he says, that \"every\r\nkind of fruit tree seems to contend in spring, who shall best entertain\r\nthe possessor with the beauty of their blossoms. Mankind are always\r\nhappy with the prospect of plenty; in no other scene is it exhibited\r\nwith such charming variety, as in the fruit garden and orchard. Are\r\ngentlemen fond of indulging their tastes? Nature, from the plentiful\r\nproductions of the above, regales them with a variety of the finest\r\nflavours and exalted relishes. To cool us in the heat of summer, she\r\ncopiously unites the acid to an agreeable sweetness. Flowering shrubs\r\nand trees are often purchased by gentlemen at a high price; yet not one\r\nof them can compare in beauty with an _apple tree_, when beginning to\r\nexpand its blossoms.\"[52] Speaking of the greengage, he says, \"its taste\r\nis so exquisitely sweet and delicious, that nothing can exceed it.\" He\r\nenlivens many of his sections on the cultivation of various fruits, by\r\nfrequent allusions to Theophrastus, Virgil, Pliny, and other _Rei\r\nrustica scriptores_. His chapter on Pears, (the various kinds of which\r\npossess \"a profusion of sweets, heightened by an endless variety of\r\ndelicious flavours,\") is particularly profuse.

There is\r\nanother edition in 1773, with additions. His intelligent Catalogue is\r\nbrought down to the end of the year 1772. This volume of Tracts contains\r\nan infinity of ingenious and curious articles. One of the chapters\r\ncontains \"A Plan for Planting all the Turnpike Roads in England with\r\nTimber Trees.\"[53] He most zealously wishes to encourage planting. \"I\r\nbelieve (says this candid writer) that one of the principal reasons why\r\nfew persons plant, springs from a fearful conjecture that their days\r\nwill have been passed, before the forest can have risen. But let not the\r\nparent harbour so selfish an idea; it should be his delight, to look\r\nforward to the advantage which his children would receive from the\r\ntimber which he planted, contented if it flourished every year beneath\r\nhis inspection; surely there is much more pleasure in planting of trees,\r\nthan in cutting of them down. View but the place where a fine tree\r\nstands, what an emblem does it afford of present beauty and of future\r\nuse; examine the spot after the noble ornament shall have been felled,\r\nand see how desolate it will appear. Perhaps there is not a better\r\nmethod of inducing youth to have an early inclination for planting,\r\nthan for fathers, who have a landed estate, to persuade those children\r\nwho are to inherit it, as soon as they come to years of discretion, to\r\nmake a small nursery, and to let them have the management of it\r\nthemselves; they will then see the trees yearly thriving under their\r\nhands: as an encouragement to them, they should, when the trees are at a\r\nfit growth to plant out, let them have the value of them for their\r\npocket money. This will, in their tender years, fix so strong an idea of\r\nthe value, and the great consequence of planting, as will never be\r\neradicated afterwards; and many youths, of the age of twenty-five,\r\nhaving planted quick growing trees, may see the industry of their\r\njuvenile years amply rewarded at that early age, a time when most young\r\nmen begin to know the value of money.\"[54] Mr. Pope, in one of his\r\nletters to Mr. Allen, thus discovers his own generous mind:--\"I am now\r\nas busy in planting for myself as I was lately in planting for another.\r\nI am pleased to think my trees will afford shade and fruit to others,\r\nwhen I shall want them no more.\" Mr. Addison's admirable recommendation\r\nof planting, forms No. 583 of the Spectator. He therein says, \"When a\r\nman considers that the putting a few twigs in the ground, is doing good\r\nto one who will make his appearance in the world about fifty years\r\nhence, or that he is perhaps making one of his own descendants easy or\r\nrich, by so inconsiderable an expence; if he finds himself averse to it,\r\nhe must conclude that he has a poor and base heart. Most people are of\r\nthe humour of an old fellow of a college, who, when he was pressed by\r\nthe society to come into something that might redound to the good of\r\ntheir successors, grew very peevish. _We are always doing_, says he,\r\n_something for posterity, but I would fain see posterity do something\r\nfor us._\"[55] Mr. Weston also published The Universal Botanist and\r\nNursery; 1770, 1774, 4 vols. 8vo. The Gardener and Planter's Calendar,\r\ncontaining the Method of Raising Timber Trees, Fruit Trees, and Quicks\r\nfor Hedges; with Directions for Forming and Managing a Garden every\r\nMonth in the Year; also many New Improvements in the Art of Gardening;\r\n8vo. 1773. Mr. Weston then appears to have lived at Kensington Gore. The\r\nGentleman's Magazine for November, 1806, says, that he died at\r\nLeicester, in 1806, aged seventy-four. He was formerly a thread hosier\r\nthere. It gives an amusing and full list of his various publications,\r\nparticularly of his intended \"Natural History of Strawberries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE MASON. The best edition of his \"Essay on Design in Gardening,\"\r\nappears to have been that of 1795, in 8vo. Two Appendixes were published\r\nin 1798, which are said to have been written by Mr. U. Price. In Mr.\r\nNichols's fourth volume of Illustrations of the Literary History of the\r\nEighteenth Century, are some particulars of Mr. Mason. He published\r\nHoccleve's Poems, with a Glossary; an Answer to Thomas Paine; the Life\r\nof Lord Howe; a Supplement to Johnson's Dictionary: in the ill-tempered\r\npreface to which, he thus strangely speaks of that Dictionary:--\"this\r\nmuddiness of intellect sadly besmears and defaces almost every page of\r\nthe composition.\" This is only a small instance of his virulence against\r\nJohnson in this preface. One would have thought that Mr. Mason's\r\nsarcasms would have been softened, or even subdued, by its glowing and\r\neloquent preface, which informs us that this great work was composed\r\n\"without one act of assistance, one word of encouragement, or one smile\r\nof favour.\" I am sorry to say, that Mr. Mason, even in the above Essay,\r\ndiscovers, in three instances, his animosity to our \"Dictionary writer,\"\r\nfor so he calls Dr. Johnson. Mr. Boswell, speaking of Johnson's preface,\r\nsays, \"We cannot contemplate without wonder, the vigorous and splendid\r\nthoughts which so highly distinguish that performance;\" and on the\r\nDictionary he observes, that \"the world contemplated with wonder, so\r\nstupendous a work, achieved by one man, while other countries had\r\nthought such undertakings fit only for whole academies.\" Linnaeus and\r\nHaller styled Ray's History of Plants, _opus immensi laboris_. One may\r\njustly apply the same words to this Dictionary. It was well for Mr.\r\nMason that he escaped (what Miss Seward called) \"the dead-doing\r\nbroadside of Dr. Johnson's satire.\" George Mason omits no opportunity of\r\ncensuring Mr. Whateley's Observations on Modern Gardening. In the above\r\nEssay, he censures him in seven different pages, and in his distinct\r\nchapter or division on this book of Mr. Whateley's, (consisting of\r\nthirteen pages) there are no less than thirty-three additional sneers,\r\nor faults, found with his opinions. He does not acknowledge in him one\r\nsingle solitary merit, except at page 191. In page 160, he nearly, if\r\nnot quite, calls him a _fool_, and declares that _vanity_ is the passion\r\nto which he is constantly sacrificing.[56] It would be an insult to any\r\none who has read Mr. Whateley's work, to endeavour to clear him from\r\nsuch a virulent and ill-founded attack. Neither Dr. Johnson, with all\r\nhis deep learning, nor Mr. Whateley, with all the cultivated fancy of a\r\nrich scholastic mind, would either of them have been able to comprehend,\r\nor to understand, or even to make head or tail of the first half of Mr.\r\nGeorge Mason's poem, with which he closes the above edition of his\r\nEssay. As he has been so caustically severe against Dr. Johnson, it\r\ncannot be ungenerous if one applies to the above part of his own poem,\r\nthe language of a French critic on another subject:--\"Le style en est\r\ndur, et scabreux. Il semble que l'auteur a ramasse les termes les plus\r\nextraordinaires pour se rendre inintelligible.\" Percy, Bishop of\r\nDromore, in vol. x. page 602, of the British Critic, has given a\r\ncritique of Mr. Mason's edition of Hoccleve, in which he chastises its\r\ninjustice, arrogance, and ignorance. Mr. Mason has been more liberal in\r\nwarmly praising Kent, and Shenstone, in acknowledging the great taste\r\nand elegance of Mr. Thomas Warton, when the latter notices Milton's line\r\nof\r\n\r\n   _Bosom'd high in tufted trees,_\r\n\r\nwhich picturesque remark of Mr. Warton's could not have been excelled\r\neven by the nice and critical pen of the late Sir U. Price; and when he\r\ninforms us, in more than one instance, of the great Earl of Chatham's\r\n\"turning his mind to the embellishment of rural nature.\"\r\n\r\nTHOMAS WHATELEY, on whose \"Observations on Modern Gardening,\" the\r\nEncyclopaedia of Gardening (that most comprehensive assemblage of every\r\nthing delightful and curious in this art,) observes, \"It is remarkable,\r\nthat so little is known of a writer, the beauty of whose style, and the\r\njustness of whose taste, are universally acknowledged.\" The same work\r\nfurther says, \"his excellent book, so frequently referred to by all\r\nsucceeding writers on garden scenery, ought to be in the hands of every\r\nman of taste.\" And the same work still further observes, that \"its style\r\nhas been pronounced by Ensor, inimitable, and the descriptions with\r\nwhich his investigations are accompanied, have been largely copied, and\r\namply praised by Alison, in his work On Taste. The book was soon\r\ntranslated into the continental languages, and is judiciously praised in\r\nthe _Mercure de France_, _Journal Encyclopedique_, and Weiland's\r\n_Journal_. G. Mason alone dissents from the general opinion, enlarging\r\non the very few faults or peculiarities which are to be found in the\r\nbook. Wheatley, or Whately (for so little is known of this eminent man,\r\nthat we have never been able to ascertain satisfactorily the orthography\r\nof his name,) was proprietor of Nonsuch Park, in Surrey; and was\r\nsecretary to the Earl of Suffolk. He published only this work, soon\r\nafter which he died. After his death, some remarks on Shakspeare, from\r\nhis pen, were published in a small 12mo.\" A second edition of this\r\nelegant little work was published in 1808, by Parson, Oxford; or\r\nRivington, St. Paul's; in which, the advertisement to the reader informs\r\nus, that \"the respectable author intended to have gone through eight or\r\nten of the principal characters of Shakspeare, but suspended his design,\r\nin order to finish his Observations on Modern Gardening, first published\r\nin the year 1770; immediately after which time, _he was engaged in such\r\nan active scene of public life_, as left him but little leisure to\r\nattend to the Belles Lettres; and in the year 1772 he died.\"[57]\r\n\r\nHis remarks on some of the characters of Shakspeare (whom, in his\r\n_Observations_, he calls _the great master of nature_) breathe in many\r\nof his pages, that fire, which he could have caught only from those of\r\nthe great poet. Such was his eagerness to complete his _Observations_,\r\nthat he for a short while \"suspended his design\" of examining other\r\ncharacters of the poet, when the bright effusions of his genius \"fled up\r\nto the stars from whence they came.\" This elegant little work is merely\r\na fragment, nay, even an unfinished fragment. It must, then, cause deep\r\nregret, that death should so prematurely have deprived us of that rich\r\ntreasure of animated thoughts, which, no doubt, would have sprung from\r\nhis further tracing the poet's deep and piercing knowledge of the human\r\nheart. One may safely apply to Mr. Whateley, what he himself applies to\r\nthe poet:--\"He had a genius to express all that his penetration could\r\ndiscover.\" The Journal Encyclopedique, Juilliet, 1771, when speaking of\r\nthe French translation of Whateley's Observations, says, \"On ne peut\r\ngueres se faire une idee de ces jardins, si l'on n'a ete a Londres.\r\nAccoutumes a la symetrie des notres, nous n'imaginons pas qu'on puisse\r\netablir une forme irreguliere, comme une regle principale: cependant\r\nceux qui sentent combien la noble simplicite de la nature est superieure\r\na tous les rafinemens symetriques de l'art, donneront peuetetre la\r\npreference aux jardins Anglois. C'est l'effet que doit produire la\r\nlecture de cet ouvrage, qui quoique destine aux amateurs et aux\r\ncompositeurs des jardins, offre aux gens de gout, aux artistes et\r\nsur-tout aux peintres, des observations fines et singulieres sur\r\nplusieurs effets de perspective et sur les arts en general; aux\r\nphilosophes, des reflections justes sur les affections de notre ame; aux\r\npoetes, des descriptions exactes, quoique vives, des plus beaux jardins\r\nd'Angleterre dans tous les genres, qui decelent dans l'Auteur un oeil\r\ninfiment exerce, une grande connoissance des beaux arts, une belle\r\nimagination et un esprit accoutume a penser.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"bloom of an orchard, the festivity of a hay field, and the carols\r\nof harvest home,\" could not have met with a more cheerful and benevolent\r\npen than Mr. Whateley's; a love of country pervades many of his pages;\r\nnor could any one have traced the placid scenery, or rich magnificence\r\nof nature, with a happier pen than when he records the walk to the\r\ncottage at Claremont, the grandeur and majesty of the scene at\r\n_Blenheim_, or _Stowe_, _Persfield_, _Wotton_ in the vale of\r\nAylesbury--the rugged, savage, and craggy points of _Middleton Dale_, \"a\r\nchasm rent in the mountain by some convulsion of nature, beyond the\r\nmemory of man, or perhaps before the island was peopled,\" with its many\r\nrills, springs, rivulets, and water-falls--the vast cliffs of rocks at\r\n_Matlock_, _Bath_, that \"scene of romantic magnificence; from such\r\nscenes, probably, was conceived the wild imagination, in ancient\r\nmythology, of the giants piling _Pelion_ upon _Ossa_; the loftiness of\r\nthe rocks, and the character of the _Derwent_, a torrent in which force\r\nand fury prevail; the cascades in it are innumerable; before the water\r\nis recovered from one fall, it is hurried down another; and its\r\nagitation being thus increased by repeated shocks, it pushes on with\r\nrestless violence to the next, where it dashes against fragments of\r\nrocks, or foams among heaps of stones which the stream has driven\r\ntogether\"--the dusky gloom at the iron forge, \"close to the cascade of\r\nthe Weir, (between _Ross_ and _Monmouth_) where the agitation of the\r\ncurrent is increased by large fragments of rocks, which have been swept\r\ndown by floods from the banks, or shivered by tempests from the brow;\r\nand the sullen sound, at stated intervals, from the strokes of the great\r\nhammers in the forge, deadens the roar of the water-fall\"--the solitude,\r\nthe loveliness, and the stillness of _Dovedale_, \"the whole of which has\r\nthe air of enchantment; grotesque as chance can cast, wild as nature can\r\nproduce\"--the monkish tomb-stones, and the monuments of benefactors long\r\nsince forgotten, which appear above the green sward, at _Tintern Abbey_,\r\nwith its maimed effigies, and sculpture worn with age and weather--his\r\nview to the approach to Lord _Cadogan's_, near _Reading_--his feeling\r\nand enchanting description of the _Leasowes_--\"the wonderful efforts\r\nwhich art has made at _Painshill_ to rival nature;\" where the massy\r\nrichness of its hanging wood \"gives an air of grandeur to the\r\nwhole\"--the _Tinian_, and other lawns, and noble and magnificent views\r\nin that vast sylvan scene _Hagley_, where, in a spot which once\r\ndelighted Mr. Pope, is inscribed an urn to his memory, \"which, when\r\nshewn by a gleam of moonlight through the trees, fixes that\r\nthoughtfulness and composure to which the mind is insensibly led by the\r\nrest of this elegant scene.\"\r\n\r\nHis section \"Of the Seasons,\" where he descants on the _spirit_ of the\r\nmorning, the _excess_ of noon, or the _temperance_ of evening,\" must\r\nstrike every one by its felicity of style; and the reader may judge of\r\nthe rich pages which this book contains, even from what he says of\r\nwater:--\"It accommodates itself to every situation; is the most\r\ninteresting object in a landscape, and the happiest circumstance in a\r\nretired recess; captivates the eye at a distance, invites approach, and\r\nis delightful when near; it refreshes an open exposure; it animates a\r\nshade; cheers the dreariness of a waste, and enriches the most crowded\r\nview; in form, in style, and in extent, may be made equal to the\r\ngreatest compositions, or adapted to the least; it may spread in a calm\r\nexpanse to soothe the tranquillity of a peaceful scene; or hurrying\r\nalong a devious course, add splendour to a gay, and extravagance to a\r\nromantic, situation. So various are the characters which water can\r\nassume, that there is scarcely an idea in which it may not concur, or an\r\nimpression which it cannot enforce; a deep stagnated pool, dank and dark\r\nwith shades which it dimly reflects, befits the seat of melancholy; even\r\na river, if it be sunk between two dismal banks, and dull both in motion\r\nand colour, is like a hollow eye which deadens the countenance; and over\r\na sluggard, silent stream, creeping heavily along all together, hangs a\r\ngloom, which no art can dissipate, nor even the sunshine disperse. A\r\ngently murmuring rill, clear and shallow, just gurgling, just dimpling,\r\nimposing silence, suits with solitude, and leads to meditation; a\r\nbrisker current, which wantons in little eddies over a bright sandy\r\nbottom, or babbles among pebbles, spreads cheerfulness all around; a\r\ngreater rapidity, and more agitation, to a certain degree are animating;\r\nbut in excess, instead of wakening, they alarm the senses; the roar and\r\nthe rage of a torrent, its force, its violence, its impetuosity, tend to\r\ninspire terror; that terror, which, whether as cause or effect, is so\r\nnearly allied to sublimity.\"[58]\r\n\r\n\r\nDANIEL MALTHUS, ESQ. purchased, in 1759, the Rookery, near Dorking,\r\nnoted for its beauties of hill, dale, wood, and water; he sold it in\r\n1768. He translated Gerardin, _De la Composition des Paysages_, 12mo.\r\n1783, to which he prefixed a preface, being, chiefly, remarks on what\r\nthe gardens of the Greeks and Romans were; a view of Rosseau's tomb is\r\nprefixed. Mr. Malthus justly observes, that this Essay \"is full of the\r\nmost insinuating eloquence, that it is wrote by the friend of Rousseau,\r\nand from scenes which realize some of its most beautiful descriptions.\"\r\nHe further observes, that \"trifling as this enquiry will appear in\r\nitself, it may add something towards the benevolent purpose of M.\r\nd'Ernonville, which is to make men sensible of the exhaustless charms of\r\nnature, to lead them back to their simple and original tastes, to\r\npromote the variety and resources of a country life, and to unite its\r\nusefulness with its embellishment.\"[59]\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN KENNEDY published a Treatise upon Planting, Gardening, &c. 8vo.\r\n_York_, 1776.\r\n\r\n\r\nN.

Desirous of conveying to our readers all\r\nthe information which we can compress, with propriety, within the limits\r\nof our plan, we wished to have given the _substance_ of this valuable\r\npaper; but finding it already in the language of simplicity, and being\r\naware of the mischiefs which generally ensue in _meddling_ with the\r\nproductions of genius, we had only one alternative: either wholly to\r\ntranscribe, or wholly to reject.\" Mr. Marshall, alluding to the above\r\nwork of his, says, \"Wheatley, Mason, and Nature, with some Experience,\r\nand much Observation, are the principal sources from which this part of\r\nour work was drawn; it was planned, and in part written, among the\r\nmagnificent scenes of nature, in Monmouthshire, Herefordshire, and\r\nGloucestershire, where the rich and the romantic are happily blended, in\r\na manner unparalleled in any other part of the island.\" In this same\r\nwork is preserved, Mr. Gray's letter on the scenery of _Grasmere Water_.\r\nHis descriptions of many trees and shrubs are extremely interesting; and\r\nhe has rendered them more so by his frequent quotations from Mr.\r\nHanbury. He also published, in 8vo. The Rural Economy of the Southern\r\nCounties; 2 vols.--of the Midland Counties, 2 vols.--of Gloucestershire,\r\n2 vols.--of Norfolk, 2 vols.--of Yorkshire, 2 vols.--Agriculture of the\r\nSouthern Counties, 2 vols.--Minutes of Agriculture--and a Review of the\r\nLandscape, a didactic poem--and of an Essay on the Picturesque. The\r\nEncyclop. of Gardening, after relating varied information respecting\r\nhim, says, that he \"finally retired to a considerable property he\r\npossessed in his native county, in the Vale of Cleveland, in 1808, where\r\nhe died, at an advanced age, in 1819. He was a man of little education,\r\nbut of a strong and steady mind: and pursued, in the most consistent\r\nmanner, from the year 1780 to his death, the plan he originally laid\r\ndown; that of collecting and condensing the agricultural practices of\r\nthe different counties of England, with a view to a general work on\r\nLanded Property, which he published; another on Agriculture, which he\r\ndid not live to complete, and a _Rural Institute_, in which he was\r\nsupplanted by the Board of Agriculture.\" His observations on the\r\n_Larch_, in vol. i. of his \"Planting and Rural Ornament,\" and the zeal\r\nwith which he recommends the planting of it on the infertile heathy\r\nflats of Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire, on the bleak and barren heights\r\nof Yorkshire, Westmoreland, Cornwall, and Devon, and on the Welch and\r\nSalopean hills; and the powerful language with which he enforces its\r\nvaluable qualities, merit the attention of every man of property.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM SPEECHLY. He wrote Hints on Domestic Rural Economy; 8vo. On the\r\nCulture of the Vine and Pine Apple, with Hints on the Formation of\r\nVineyards in England. On the Culture of the Pine Apple, and the\r\nManagement of the Hot-House; 8vo. He made a tour in Holland, chiefly to\r\nobserve the Dutch mode of cultivating the Pine, and the Grape. Mr.\r\nLoudon, in his Encyclop. calls him \"the Moses of modern British vine\r\ndressers;\" and in the Gardener's Magazine for January, 1828, has given\r\nan interesting and honourable character of him. He died at Great Milton,\r\nin 1819, aged eighty-six.[60] Marshall, in his Planting and Rural\r\nOrnament, has given us Mr. Speechley's sensible letter on the Duke of\r\nPortland's Plantations. Mr. Johnson says \"he perhaps surpassed every\r\npractical gardener of his age.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIP LE BROCQ, chaplain to the Duke of Gloucester, wrote,\r\n\r\n1, A Description of Certain Methods of Planting, Training, and Managing\r\nall Kinds of Fruit Trees, Vines, &c. London, 8vo. 1786.\r\n\r\n2, Sketch of a Plan for making the New Forest, a Real Forest.\r\n_Stockdale_, 8vo. 1793.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALTER NICHOL, whom Mr. Loudon, in his Encyclopaedia, calls an author of\r\nmerit, and informs us that Mr. Nichol, \"in the year 1810, undertook an\r\nextensive journey through England, for the purpose of visiting the\r\nprincipal seats and plantations, with a view, on his return, to compose\r\nthe _Planter's Calendar_. This work had scarcely commenced, when he was\r\nseized with an illness which carried him off suddenly, in March, 1811.\"\r\nHis works appear to be the following:--\r\n\r\nThe Gardener's Kalendar; or, Monthly Directory of every Branch of\r\nHorticulture; 8vo.\r\n\r\nThe Planter's Kalendar; or, the Nurseryman's and Forester's Guide; 8vo.\r\n\r\nThe Villa Garden Directory; or, Monthly Index of Work to be done in\r\nGardens, Shrubberies, &c.; 12mo.\r\n\r\nScotch Forcing Gardener; 8vo.\r\n\r\nThe Practical Planter.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson says \"his works are of the first authority, and rank as the\r\nequals of those of Abercrombie, being the result of long practice during\r\nan enlightened era of our art.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES MADDOCK, of the Society of Friends, and commercial florist, at\r\nWalworth, where, about the middle of last century, he established the\r\nflorist garden there, now belonging to Milliken and Curtis. He died\r\nabout 1806. He published the Florist's Directory, and Complete Treatise\r\non the Culture of Flowers; 8vo. 1792. New editions in 1810 and 1822.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS S. D. BUCKNALL, Esq. published the Orchardist; extracted from the\r\nSociety's Trans. for the Encouragement of Arts, &c.; _with additions_.\r\n8vo. 1797.\r\n\r\nI had omitted the following, for which I am indebted to Mr. Johnson's\r\nHistory of English Gardening:--\r\n\r\nRICHARD RICHARDSON. De cultu Hortorum, Carmen. 4to. London, 1669.\r\n\r\nOf either of the above enumerated Authors on Gardening, I have not been\r\nable to discover any Portrait.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n   Of the following we _have_ Portraits:--\r\n\r\nLEONARD MASCALL'S portrait appears at the bottom of the curious title\r\npage to his \"Government of Cattle,\" 4to. and is _scarce_. He published,\r\nin 1572, \"The New Art of Planting and Grafting;\" 4to. and in 12mo.\r\nAnother edition in 1652.\r\n\r\nDR. WILLIAM BULLEYN practised physic at Durham. He died in 1576. He had\r\nthe misfortune to lose great part of his library by shipwreck. He was\r\nthrown into prison for debt, where he wrote a great part of his medical\r\ntreatises. Bishop Tanner says he was a man of acute judgment, and true\r\npiety. He was universally esteemed as a polished scholar, and as a man\r\nof probity, benevolence, and piety. I gather the following from Dr.\r\nPulteney:--\"Of Dr. Bulleyn there is a profile with a long beard, before\r\nhis \"Government of Health,\" and a whole length of him, in wood, prefixed\r\nto the \"Bulwarke of Defence;\" which book is a collection of most of his\r\nworks. He was an ancestor of the late Dr. Stukely, who, in 1722, was at\r\nthe expence of having a small head of him engraved. He proves that we\r\nhad excellent apples, pears, plums, cherries and hops, of our own\r\ngrowth, (before the importation of these articles into England), by\r\nLondon and Kentish gardeners. His zeal for the promotion of the useful\r\narts of gardening, the general culture of the land, and the commercial\r\ninterests of the kingdom, deserved the highest praise; and for the\r\ninformation he has left of these affairs, in his own time, posterity owe\r\nhim acknowledgments.\" In a note to his Life, in the Biog. Dict., 7 vols.\r\nfolio, 1748, is a curious account of many fruits, &c. then in our\r\ngardens. The same note is in Kippis. Richardson's portraits to Granger\r\ngives us the above profile. Mr. Johnson, at page 51 of his History of\r\nEnglish Gardening, pointedly says, \"Dr. Bulleyn deserves the veneration\r\nof every lover of gardening, for his strenuous advocating its cause, at\r\na time when it had become a fashion to depreciate the products of our\r\nEnglish gardens.\" And at page 57, pays him a further just tribute.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS HYLL, who, in 1574, published, in 4to., \"The Profitable Arte of\r\nGardeninge.\" Another edition in 1593, 4to. His interesting chapter on\r\nBees is annexed to these editions.\"[61] There appears another edition in\r\nsmall 12mo. imprinted at London, in Flete-strete, neare to St.\r\nDunstone's Church, by Thomas Marshe, 1658. There are other editions, as\r\n1570 and 1574, 4to.; 1568, 12mo.; and 1563 and 1594, 16mo. Bromley thus\r\nmentions a portrait of him:--\"Thomas Hill, wooden cut, prefixed to his\r\nPhysiognomie; 12mo. 1571. Aged 42. A friend to Hyll, in a complimentary\r\nletter, prefixed to the above book, thus, in part, addresses the\r\nreader:--\r\n\r\n   _With painfull pen the writer hath exprest in English plane,\r\n   The needfull ayd, and mightie force, that doth in hearbes remaine,\r\n   The time to set, the time to plant, the time to raise again,\r\n   This man by treble diligence hath brought to light with paine._\r\n\r\nThe portraits of the Lord Chancellor BACON are well known; but in Mr.\r\nMontagu's late edition of his works, a new or juvenile portrait is\r\nadded, namely, a most expressive, intelligent, and beautiful miniature\r\nof him at his age of eighteen, by Hilyard, of whom Dr. Donne said,\r\n\r\n         ----_a hand or eye\r\n   By Hilyard drawn, is worth a history\r\n   By a worse painter._\r\n\r\nThis fine edition of his works is illustrated by five portraits, taken\r\nat different periods of his lordship's life; by engravings of his\r\nresidence, and monument, fac-similes, and other embellishments. In\r\nMallett's edition are two portraits, one by Vertue, finely\r\nengraved.[62]\r\n\r\nGERARDE'S portrait (a fine one) is prefixed to his own edition of his\r\nHerbal. Two coats of arms are at the bottom. No painter, or engraver's\r\nname, except the initials, W. R. intertwined, which I suppose are those\r\nof W. Rogers, the engraver. There is another good head of Gerarde, a\r\nsmall oval one, in the title page to Johnson's edition. A portrait, in\r\noil, of Gerarde, was sold by Mr. Christie, Nov. 11, 1826. Dr. Pulteney\r\nreviews both these Herbals. Gerarde is highly extolled by Dr. Bulleyn,\r\nand indeed attained deserved eminence in his day. Dr. Pulteney relates\r\nthat \"the thousand novelties which were brought into England by our\r\ncircumnavigators, Raleigh and Cavendish, in 1580 and 1588, excited a\r\ndegree of attention, which at this day cannot, without the aid of\r\nconsiderable recollection, be easily conceived. Raleigh himself appears\r\nto have possessed a larger share of taste for the curious productions of\r\nnature, than was common to the seafaring adventurers of that period. And\r\nposterity will rank these voyagers among the greatest benefactors to\r\nthis kingdom, in having been the means, if tradition may be credited, of\r\nintroducing the most useful root that Providence has held forth for the\r\nservice of man. A voyage round the globe, howsoever familiarized in\r\nours, was, in that age, a most interesting and fruitful occasion of\r\nenquiry. The return of Raleigh, and the fame of his manifold discoveries\r\nand collections, brought over from the continent the celebrated Clusius,\r\nthen in the fifty-fifth year of his age. He, who added more to the stock\r\nof botany, in his day, than all his contemporaries united, visited\r\nEngland for the third time, to partake, at this critical juncture, in\r\nthe general gratification. At this eventful period, Gerarde was in the\r\nvigour of life, and, without doubt, felt the influence, and reaped\r\nthe advantage of all the circumstances I have enumerated.\" One\r\nof the editions of Gerarde thus appears in a bookseller's\r\ncatalogue:--\"Gerarde's Herball; or Generall Historie of Plants, very\r\nmuch enlarged by Johnson, folio, _beautiful impression of the\r\nfrontispiece by Payne, fine copy, old Russia, gilt back, L3. 18s.\r\n1633_.[63]\r\n\r\n\r\nWALTER BLYTHE'S whole-length portrait (exhibiting a pensive and\r\npenetrating aspect), is prefixed to his \"English Improver Improved;\" and\r\nwhich work Professor Martyn terms \"an original and incomparable work for\r\nthe time.\" Dr. Beale calls him \"honest Captain Blithe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGERVASE MARKHAM'S portrait is prefixed to his \"Perfect Horseman;\" 8vo.\r\nIt is re-engraved for Richardson's portraits to Granger. Markham\r\nappears to have been a good soldier, as well as a good scholar. He\r\npublished in 4to. 1623, \"The Country House-Wife's Garden.\" He wrote\r\nHerod and Antipater, a tragedy. Langbaine speaks very much in his\r\npraise, and seemingly not without reason. Dr. Dibden, in his \"Library\r\nCompanion,\" says, \"on many accounts does Markham seem entitled to more\r\nnotice and commendation.\" He translated Leibault's Maison Rustique, in\r\n1616, in 4to. or small folio, and augmented it with many additions from\r\nOliver de Serres, and others. Weston, in his Catalogue, says he\r\nre-printed the editions in 1614 and 1631, of Barnaby Gooche's Husbandry.\r\nHe published many books on husbandry, on fowling, on angling, on\r\nmilitary discipline, on horsemanship. Many of their titles are\r\nenumerated in Langbaine, and in Weston, and they appear all to be more\r\nfully stated in Watts's Bibl. Brit. Much information, as to Markham, may\r\nbe seen in vol. ii. of the Censura Literaria; and in Sir E. Brydges's\r\nedition of Phillips's Theatrum Poetarum Anglicanorum, appears, perhaps,\r\nthe best list of his works, with a brief memoir.[64]\r\n\r\n\r\nPARKINSON'S excellent portrait, by Marshall, appears in the title page\r\nto his _Theatrum Botanicum_, in 1640. Some one _may_ now possess the\r\noriginal. In his _Paradisus_, 1635, there is a very scurvy engraving of\r\nhis healthy, and hearty-looking old countenance. In this miserable cut,\r\nwhich is on wood, the graver, Christopher Switzer, does not seem to have\r\nhad a strife \"_with nature to outdo the life_.\" Marshall's head is\r\nre-engraved for Richardson's Illustrations to Granger. Parkinson rose to\r\nsuch a degree of reputation, as to be appointed Apothecary to King\r\nJames. He was appointed herbalist to Charles I. Dr. Pulteney speaks\r\nhighly of both the above works, particularly of the _Theatrum_. All the\r\nmemorials we have of the private history of this most industrious and\r\nzealous herbalist, are very scanty. He died about 1645, aged about 78.\r\nThe curious contents of his _Paradisus_ are diffusively narrated in\r\nJohnson's English Gardening. When perusing the pages of either of the\r\nabove, one may exclaim,\r\n\r\n                           ----\"not a tree,\r\n   A plant, a leaf, a blossom, but contains\r\n   A folio volume. We may read, and read,\r\n   And read again; and still find something new,\r\n   Something to please, and something to instruct,\r\n   E'en in the humble weed.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe above is scarcely better than Switzer's. There appears no faithful\r\nportrait of Parkinson, but Marshall's, who _had the felicity_ to draw\r\nother portraits besides his.\r\n\r\nHollar's striking portraits of the TRADESCANTS, are well known. On their\r\ntomb, at Lambeth, the following lines form part of the inscription:--\r\n\r\n   These famous Antiquarians, that had been\r\n   Both Gardeners to the rose and lily Queen,\r\n   Transplanted now themselves, sleep here; and when\r\n   Angels shall with their trumpets waken men,\r\n   And fire shall purge the world, these hence shall rise,\r\n   And change this Garden for a Paradise.\r\n\r\nIn the Ashmolean Museum, is a portrait of the SON, _in his garden_, with\r\na spade in his hand. In Mr. Nichols's \"Illustrations to Granger,\"\r\nconsisting of seventy-five portraits, appear those of the Tradescants,\r\nfather and son. Smith also engraved John Tradescant, with his son, and\r\ntheir monument, 1793. Mr. Weston, in his Catalogue, fully describes the\r\n_Museum Tradescantium_. Dr. Pulteney observes, that \"in a work devoted\r\nto the commemoration of Botanists, their name stands too high not to\r\ndemand an honourable notice; since they contributed, at an early period,\r\nby their garden and museum, to raise a curiosity that was eminently\r\nuseful to the progress and improvement of natural history in general.\r\nThe reader may see a curious account of the remains of this garden,\r\ndrawn up in the year 1749, by the late Sir W. Watson, and printed in\r\nvol. xlvi. of the Phil. Trans. The son died in 1662. His widow erected a\r\ncurious monument, in memory of the family, in Lambeth church-yard, of\r\nwhich a large account, and engravings from a drawing of it in the\r\nPepysian Library, at Cambridge, are given by the late learned Dr.\r\nDucarel, in vol. lxiii. of the Phil. Trans.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR HENRY WOTTON, Provost of Eaton. His portrait is given in Isaac\r\nWalton's Lives of Wotton, and others. It, of course, accompanies\r\nZouch's, and the other well-known editions of Isaac Walton's Lives. In\r\nEvans's Illustrations to Granger, is Sir H. Wotton, from the picture in\r\nthe Bodleian Library, engraved by _Stow_. In Sir Henry's Reflections on\r\nAncient and Modern Learning, is his chapter \"On Ancient and Modern\r\nAgriculture and Gardening.\" Cowley wrote an elegy on him, which thus\r\ncommences:--\r\n\r\n   What shall we say since silent now is he,\r\n   Who when he spoke, all things would silent be;\r\n   Who had so many languages in store,\r\n   That only Fame can speak of him with more.\r\n\r\nIsaac Walton published the \"_Reliquiae Wottonianae_, or, Lives, Letters,\r\nPoems, &c. by Sir Henry Wotton,\" 12mo. 1654, with portraits of Wotton,\r\nCharles I., Earl of Essex, and Buckingham. Sir E. Brydges printed at his\r\nprivate press, at Lee Priory, Sir Henry's Characters of the Earl of\r\nEssex and Buckingham. In the _Reliquiae_, among many curious and\r\ninteresting articles, is preserved Sir Henry's delicately complimentary\r\nletter to Milton on receiving from him _Comus_. Sir Henry, when a\r\nresident at Venice, (where he was sent on three several embassies by\r\nJames) purchased for that munificent encourager of painting, the Duke of\r\nBuckingham, several valuable pictures, which were added to the Duke's\r\nmagnificent collection. Isaac Walton's Life of Wotton thus\r\nconcludes:--\"Dying worthy of his name and family, worthy of the love of\r\nso many princes, and persons of eminent wisdom and learning, worthy of\r\nthe trust committed unto him for the service of his prince and country.\"\r\nAnd, in his Angler, he thus sweetly paints the warm attachment he had\r\nfor Wotton:--\"a man with whom I have often fished and conversed, whose\r\nlearning, wit, and cheerfulness, made his company to be esteemed one of\r\nthe delights of mankind. Peace and patience, and a calm content, did\r\ncohabit in the cheerful heart of Sir Henry Wotton.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR THOMAS BROWNE. Mr. Dallaway, in his Anecdotes of the Arts, mentions\r\nthe following portrait of Sir Thomas:--\"At Devonshire-house is a family\r\ngroupe, by Dobson, of Sir Thomas Browne. He is smiling with the utmost\r\ncomplacency upon his children, who surround him.\" His portrait is also\r\nprefixed to his works. The Biograph. Dict., folio, 1748, says, \"his\r\npicture, in the College of Physicians, shews him to have been remarkably\r\nhandsome, and to have possessed, in a singular degree, the blessings of\r\na grave, yet cheerful and inviting, countenance.\" The same work farther\r\ngives him a most amiable character. Mr. Ray, in his Ornithology, does\r\nnot omit paying a just compliment to his assistant and friend, \"the\r\ndeservedly famous Sir Thomas Browne.\" Evelyn, in 1671, mentions Sir\r\nThomas Browne's garden at Norwich, as containing a paradise of\r\nvarieties, and the gardens of all the inhabitants as full of excellent\r\nflowers. Switzer says, \"The noble elegance of his style has since\r\ninduced many to read his works, (of which, that of _Cyrus's gardens_ is\r\nsome of the brightest,) though they have had little inclination to the\r\npractice of gardening itself. There remains nothing that I have heard of\r\nhis putting gardening actually into practice himself; but some of his\r\nlast works being observations on several scarce plants mentioned in\r\nScripture; and of Garlands and Coronary garden plants and flowers, 'tis\r\nreasonable to suppose he did; and the love he had so early and late\r\ndiscovered toward it, was completed in the delightful practice thereof.\"\r\nHe further says, \" his elaborate and ingenious pen has not a little\r\nadded to the nobleness of our subject.\"[65] His works were published in\r\n1 vol. folio, 1686, with his portrait, engraved by White. His portrait\r\nappears also to his \"Certain Miscellany Tracts,\" 8vo. A list of his\r\nnumerous works may be seen in the Biogr. Dictionaires, or in Watts's\r\nBibl. Britt. To his \"Christian Morals,\" Dr. Johnson has prefixed his\r\nLife. It is so masterly written, that it is impossible to give even an\r\nabstract. Dr. Kippis has, however, in part, transcribed it. He was\r\nchosen Honorary Fellow of the College of Physicians, as a man _virtute\r\net literas ornatissimus_. In 1671, he received the honour of Knighthood\r\nfrom Charles II., a prince, (says Dr. Johnson) \"who, with many frailties\r\nand vices, had yet skill to discover excellence, and virtue to reward it\r\nwith such honorary distinctions, at least, as cost him nothing, yet,\r\nconferred by a king so judicious and so much beloved, had the power of\r\ngiving merit new lustre and greater popularity.\" Thus he lived in high\r\nreputation, till, in his seventy-sixth year, an illness, which tortured\r\nhim a week, put an end to his life, at Norwich, on his birth-day,\r\nOctober 19, 1682. \"Some of his last words (we are told by _Whitefoot_)\r\nwere expressions of submission to the will of God, and fearlessness of\r\ndeath.\" Dr. Johnson observes, \"It is not on the praises of others, but\r\non his own writings, that he is to depend for the esteem of posterity;\r\nof which he will not be easily deprived, while learning shall have any\r\nreverence among men: for there is no science in which he does not\r\ndiscover some skill; and scarce any kind of knowledge, profane or\r\nsacred, abstruse or elegant, which he does not appear to have cultivated\r\nwith success. His exuberance of knowledge, and plenitude of ideas,\r\nsometimes obstruct the tendency of his reasoning, and the clearness of\r\nhis decisions. On whatever subject he employed his mind, there started\r\nup immediately so many images before him, that he lost one by grasping\r\nanother. His memory supplied him with so many illustrations, parallel or\r\ndependent notions, that he was always starting into collateral\r\nconsiderations. But the spirit and vigour of his pursuit always gives\r\ndelight; and the reader follows him, without reluctance, through his\r\nmazes, of themselves flowery and pleasing, and ending at the point\r\noriginally in view. There remains yet an objection against the writings\r\nof _Browne_, more formidable than the animadversions of criticism. There\r\nare passages from which some have taken occasion to rank him among\r\ndeists, and others among atheists. It would be difficult to guess how\r\nany such conclusion should be formed, had not experience shewn that\r\nthere are two sorts of men willing to enlarge the catalogue of infidels.\r\nWhen _Browne_ has been numbered among the contemners of religion by the\r\nfury of its friends, or the artifices of its enemies, it is no difficult\r\ntask to replace him among the most zealous professors of christianity.\r\nHe may perhaps, in the ardour of his imagination, have hazarded an\r\nexpression, which a mind intent upon faults may interpret into heresy,\r\nif considered apart from the rest of his discourse; but a phrase is not\r\nto be opposed to volumes. There is scarcely a writer to be found, whose\r\nprofession was not divinity, that has so frequently testified his belief\r\nof the sacred writings, has appealed to them with such unlimited\r\nsubmission, or mentioned them with such unvaried reverence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN EVELYN, ESQ. His portrait by Nanteuil, and that by Kneller, holding\r\nhis _Sylva_ in his hand, are well engraved in Mr. Bray's Memoirs. The\r\nfollowing remark is from the Quarterly Review, in its review of the same\r\nwork, in 1818:--\"At four years old he was taught to read by the parish\r\nschool-master, whose school was over the church porch; and 'at six his\r\npicture was drawn by one Chanteral, no ill painter.' If this portrait,\r\nas is not unlikely, be preserved in the family, it should have been\r\nengraved for the present work; it would have been very interesting to\r\ncompare the countenance of such a person, in childhood, in the flower of\r\nyears, when his head was engraved by Nanteuil, and in ripe old age, when\r\nhe sat to Sir G. Kneller.\" In Aubrey's Surrey, vol. iv. are many\r\ninteresting particulars of Mr. Evelyn, and his family, and he gives a\r\nlist of his works. He says \"his picture was thrice drawn in oil; first,\r\nin 1641, by one Vanderborcht, brought out of Germany at the same time\r\nwith Hollar, the graver, by the Earl of Arundel; a second time in 1648,\r\nby Walker; and the third time by Sir G. Kneller, for his friend Mr.\r\nPepys, of the Admiralty, of which that at the Royal Society is a copy.\r\nThere is a print of him by Nanteuil, who likewise drew him more than\r\nonce in black and white, with Indian ink; and a picture, in crayon, by\r\nLuterel.\" Mr. Evelyn lived in the busy times of Charles I., Cromwell,\r\nCharles II., James II., and William. He had much personal intercourse\r\nwith Charles II. and James II., and was in the habits of great intimacy\r\nwith many of the ministers of those two monarchs, and of the eminent men\r\nof those days. Foreigners, distinguished for learning or arts, who came\r\nto England, did not leave it without visiting him. His manners we may\r\npresume to have been of the most agreeable kind, for his company was\r\nsought by the greatest men, not merely by inviting him to their own\r\ntables, but by their repeated visits to him at his own house. Mr. Evelyn\r\nlived to the great age of eighty-six, and wished these words to be\r\ninscribed on his tomb:--\"all is vanity that is not honest, and there is\r\nno solid wisdom but in real piety.\"[66] Cowley, in a letter to him,\r\nsays, \"I know nobody that possesses more private happiness than you do\r\nin your garden; and yet no man who makes his happiness more publick, by\r\na free communication of the art and knowledge of it to others. All that\r\nI myself am able yet to do, is only to recommend to mankind the search\r\nof that felicity, which you instruct them how to find and to enjoy.\" The\r\nQuarterly Review thus speaks of his _Sylva_:--\"The Sylva remained a\r\nbeautiful and enduring memorial of his amusements, his occupations, and\r\nhis studies, his private happiness, and his public virtues. The greater\r\npart of the woods, which were raised in consequence of Evelyn's\r\nwritings, have been cut down; the oaks have borne the British flag to\r\nseas and countries which were undiscovered when they were planted, and\r\ngeneration after generation has been coffined in the elms. The trees of\r\nhis age, which may yet be standing, are verging fast toward their decay\r\nand dissolution: but his name is fresh in the land, and his reputation,\r\nlike the trees of an Indian Paradise, exists, and will continue to exist\r\nin full strength and beauty, uninjured by the course of time.\" Mr.\r\nLoudon, in his Encycl. of Gardening, thus speaks of him:--\"Evelyn is\r\nuniversally allowed to have been one of the warmest friends to\r\nimprovements in gardening and planting, that has ever appeared. He is\r\neulogized by Wotton, in his _Reflections on Ancient and Modern\r\nLearning_, as having done more than all former ages.\" Switzer calls him\r\n\"that good esquire, the king of gardeners.\" His life (says Mr. Walpole)\r\n\"was a course of inquiry, study, curiosity, instruction, and\r\nbenevolence. He knew that retirement, in his own hands, was industry and\r\nbenefit to mankind; in those of others, laziness and inutility.\"\r\n\r\nThere appears the following more modern publications respecting Mr.\r\nEvelyn:--\r\n\r\n1. Sylva, with Notes by Hunter; in 4to, and 8vo.\r\n\r\n2. Memoirs and Correspondence of Mr. Evelyn. Edited by Mr. Bray. 5 vols.\r\n8vo. _Portraits_, and other plates. L3. 10s. Another edition, in 2\r\nvols., 4to.\r\n\r\n3. Evelyn's Miscellaneous Writings, collected and edited, with Notes, by\r\nMr. Upcott. Forming a Supplement to the Evelyn Memoirs. 1 vol. 4to. with\r\nplates, 1825. L3. 10s.\r\n\r\nThe Encycl. of Gardening enumerates the whole of Mr. Evelyn's works. So\r\ndoes Dr. Watts in his Bibl. Britt.; and Mr. Johnson in his History of\r\nEnglish Gardening.[67]\r\n\r\nABRAHAM COWLEY. The portraits of him are well known. That in Bishop\r\nHurd's edition is very neat. This same portrait is also well engraved\r\nfor Ankars's edition of Cowley; and also in that by Aikens, in 8vo. Dean\r\nSprat has prefixed to his edition of Cowley, his portrait, engraved by\r\nFaithorne, and, in his preface, pays a warm and just tribute to his\r\nmemory. When his death was announced to Charles II., he declared, that\r\nMr. Cowley had not left a better man behind him in England. Cowley\r\naddresses his chapter _Of Gardens_ (which strongly paints his delight in\r\nthem) to Mr. Evelyn. He wrote this epitaph for himself:--\r\n\r\n   From life's superfluous cares enlarg'd,\r\n   His debt of human toil discharg'd,\r\n   Here COWLEY lies, beneath this shed,\r\n   To ev'ry worldly interest _dead_:\r\n   With decent poverty content;\r\n   His hours of ease not idly spent;\r\n   To fortune's goods a foe profess'd,\r\n   And, hating wealth, by all caress'd.\r\n   'Tis sure he's _dead_; for, lo! how small\r\n   A spot of earth is now his all!\r\n   O! wish that earth may lightly lay,\r\n   And ev'ry care be far away!\r\n   Bring flow'rs, the short-liv'd roses bring,\r\n   To _life deceased_ fit offering!\r\n   And sweets around the poet strow,\r\n   Whilst yet with life his ashes glow.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ROSE, head gardener to the Lord Essex, at Essex-house, in the\r\nStrand. He sent him to study the celebrated beauties in the gardens of\r\nVersailles. He became afterwards the chief gardener to Charles II., at\r\nthe royal gardens in St. James's Park. His portrait may be seen at\r\nKensington, in an oil painting, where he is presenting a pine to his\r\nMajesty, whilst on a visit to the Duchess of Cleveland, at Downey Court,\r\nBuckinghamshire. It has lately been engraved in mezzotinto. He was the\r\nauthor of \"The English Vineyard Vindicated, and the Way of Making Wine\r\nin France;\" first printed with Evelyn's French Gardener, in 1672, 12mo.\r\nOther editions in 1675, 1676, and 1690, in 8vo. The preface is by\r\nEvelyn, as well as The Art of Making Wine. Rose brought to great\r\nperfection dwarf fruit trees, in the gardens at Hampton Court, Carlton,\r\nand Marlborough House. Switzer thus speaks of him:--\"He was esteemed to\r\nbe the best of his profession in those days, and ought to be remembered\r\nfor the encouragement he gave to a servant of his, that has since made\r\nthe greatest figure that ever yet any gardener did, I mean Mr. London.\r\nMr. Rose may be well ranked amongst the greatest virtuosos of that time,\r\n(now dead) who were all well pleased to accept of his company while\r\nliving.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES COTTON. He published \"The Planter's Manual,\" 12mo. 1675. There\r\nis prefixed to it a rural frontispiece, by Van Houe. Mr. Johnson\r\nproperly calls him \"one of the _Scriptores minores_ of horticulture.\"\r\nHis \"devoted attachment to Izaak Walton, forms the best evidence we have\r\nof his naturally amiable disposition.\" His portrait is finely engraved\r\nin Mr. Major's extensively illustrated and most attractive editions of\r\nthe Angler; a delightful book, exhibiting a \"matchless picture of rural\r\nnature.\" Mr. Cotton's portrait is also well engraved in Zouch's Life of\r\nWalton; and in the many other curious and embellished editions of Walton\r\nand Cotton's Angler. He translated with such truth and spirit, the\r\ncelebrated Essays of Montaigne, that he received from that superior\r\ncritic, the Marquis of Halifax, a most elegant encomium. Sir John\r\nHawkins calls it \"one of the most valuable books in the English\r\nlanguage.\" A complete list of Mr. Cotton's works appears in Watts's\r\nBibl. Britt. When describing, in his _Wonders of the Peake_, the Queen\r\nof Scot's Pillar, he thus breaks out:--\r\n\r\n   Illustrious _Mary_, it had happy been,\r\n   Had you then found a cave like this to skreen\r\n   Your sacred person from those frontier spies,\r\n   That of a sovereign princess durst make prize,\r\n   When Neptune too officiously bore\r\n   Your cred'lous innocence to this faithless shore.\r\n   Oh, _England_! once who hadst the only fame\r\n   Of being kind to all who hither came\r\n   For refuge and protection, how couldst thou\r\n   So strangely alter thy good nature now,\r\n   Where there was so much excellence to move,\r\n   Not only thy compassion, but thy love?\r\n   'Twas strange on earth, save _Caledonian_ ground,\r\n   So impudent a villain could be found,\r\n   Such majesty and sweetness to accuse;\r\n   Or, after that, a judge would not refuse\r\n   Her sentence to pronounce; or that being done,\r\n   Even amongst bloody'st hangmen, to find one\r\n   Durst, though her face was veil'd, and neck laid down,\r\n   Strike off the fairest head e'er wore a crown.\r\n   And what state policy there might be here,\r\n   Which does with right too often interfere,\r\n   I 'm not to judge: yet thus far dare be bold,\r\n   A fouler act the sun did ne'er behold.[68]\r\n\r\nPlott, in his Staffordshire, calls Mr. Cotton \"his worthy, learned, and\r\nmost ingenious friend.\" Sir John Hawkins thus speaks of him:--\"He was\r\nboth a wit and a scholar; of an open, cheerful, and hospitable temper;\r\nendowed with fine talents for conversation, and the courtesy and\r\naffability of a gentleman.\" He farther thus speaks of one of his\r\npoems:--\"It is not for their courtly and elegant turn, that the verses\r\nof Charles Cotton ought to be praised; there is such a delightful flow\r\nof feeling and sentiment, so much of the best part of our nature mixed\r\nup in them, and so much fancy displayed, that one of our most\r\ndistinguished living poets has adduced several passages of his Ode upon\r\nWinter, for a general illustration of the characteristics of fancy.\" He\r\nmust have possessed many endearing qualities, for the benevolent and\r\npious Walton thus concludes a letter to his \"most honoured friend,\r\nCharles Cotton, Esq.:\"--\"though I be more than a hundred miles from you,\r\nand in the eighty-third year of my age, yet I will forget both, and next\r\nmonth begin a pilgrimage to beg your pardon: for I would die in your\r\nfavour, and till then will live, Sir, your most affectionate father and\r\nfriend, Isaac Walton.\" One cannot wonder at the good old man wishing to\r\nvisit the courteous and well-bred Mr. Cotton, and to enjoy the\r\nintercourse of hospitable urbanity, near the pastoral streams of the\r\nDove, when he had received such an invitation as the following,\r\naddressed to his \"dear and most worthy friend, Mr. Isaac Walton:\"--\r\n\r\n   Whilst in this cold and blustering clime,\r\n     Where bleak winds howl and tempests roar,\r\n   We pass away the roughest time\r\n     Has been of many years before;\r\n\r\n   Whilst from the most tempestuous nooks\r\n     The chillest blasts our peace invade,\r\n   And by great rains our smallest brooks\r\n     Are almost navigable made;\r\n\r\n   Whilst all the ills are so improved,\r\n     Of this dead quarter of the year,\r\n   That even you, so much beloved,\r\n     We would not now wish with us here;\r\n\r\n   In this estate, I say, it is\r\n     Some comfort to us to suppose,\r\n   That, in a better clime than this,\r\n     You, our dear friend, have more repose;\r\n\r\n   And some delight to me the while,\r\n     Though nature now does weep in rain,\r\n   To think that I have seen her smile,\r\n     And haply may I do again.\r\n\r\n   If the all-ruling Power please\r\n     We live to see another May,\r\n   We'll recompense an age of these\r\n     Foul days in one fine fishing day.\r\n\r\n   We then shall have a day or two,\r\n     Perhaps a week, wherein to try\r\n   What the best master's hand can do\r\n     With the most deadly killing fly:\r\n\r\n   A day with not too bright a beam,\r\n     A warm, but not a scorching sun,\r\n   A southern gale to curl the stream,\r\n     and, master, half our work is done.\r\n\r\n   There, whilst behind some bush we wait\r\n     The scaly people to betray,--\r\n   We'll prove it just, with treacherous bait\r\n     To make the preying _Trout_ our prey.\r\n\r\n   And think ourselves, in such an hour,\r\n     Happier than those, though not so high,\r\n   Who, like _Leviathans_, devour\r\n     Of meaner men the smaller fry.\r\n\r\n   This, my best friend, at my poor home\r\n     Shall be our pastime and our theme;\r\n   But then--should you not deign to come,\r\n     You make all this a flattering dream.\r\n\r\nIn wandering over the lovely scenes, the pleasant brooks, the\r\nflower-bespangled meadows, which the moral pages of Isaac Walton so\r\nunaffectedly delineate, it is impossible not to recur to the name of the\r\nlate author of _Salmonia_, and to reflect, that on these pages he oft\r\nunbended his vigorous mind from his severe and brilliant discoveries. We\r\ncan now only lament the (almost) premature death of this high-ranked\r\nphilosopher, this great benefactor to the arts, and deep promoter of\r\nscience, whose mortal remains were consigned to his unostentatious tomb,\r\nat Geneva, in one of the finest evenings of summer, followed by the\r\neloquent and amiable historian, De Sismondi, and by other learned and\r\nillustrious men. One may apply to his last moments at Geneva, (where he\r\nhad arrived only one day before) these lines of his own favourite\r\nHerbert:--\r\n\r\n   _Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,\r\n     The bridal of the earth and sky,\r\n   Sweet dews shall weep thy fall to-night,\r\n     For thou must die!_[69]\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL GILBERT'S portrait is prefixed to his \"Florist's Vade Mecum;\"\r\n12mo. In his \"Gardener's Almanack,\" is a particular description of the\r\nroses cultivated in the English gardens at that period. He was the\r\nauthor of \"Fons Sanitatis, or the Healing Spring at Willowbridge Wells.\"\r\nHe was son-in-law to John Rea, the author of Flora, and who planned the\r\ngardens at Gerard's Bromley. Willowbridge Wells are at a little distance\r\nfrom where these once superb gardens were.\r\n\r\nJACOB BOBART, the elder, is an admirable portrait, by D. Loggan, taken\r\nat his age of eighty-one, and engraved by Burghers. Granger says it is\r\nextremely scarce. Beneath the head, which is dated 1675, is this\r\ndistich:--\r\n\r\n   _Thou Germane prince of plants, each year to thee,\r\n   Thousands of subjects grant a subsidy._\r\n\r\nIt is a venerable countenance, of deep thought. Richardson re-engraved\r\nthis among his Illustrations to Granger. Granger mentions also a\r\nwhole-length of Bobart in a garden, dog, goat, &c. 4to. The Encycl. of\r\nGardening says, \"Bobart's descendants are still in Oxford, and known as\r\ncoach proprietors.\" Do none of them possess the original painting? The\r\nmunificence of the Earl of Danby placed Bobart in the physic garden at\r\nOxford, in 1632, as supervisor; and this garden flourished many years\r\nunder his care, and that of his son Jacob, whose zeal and diligence Dr.\r\nPulteney records. The elder Bobart was the author of the _Hortus\r\nOxoniensis_, 1648. Wood, in his Athenae, informs us, that \"Jacob Bobart\r\ndied in his garden-house, in February, 1679, whereupon his body was\r\nburied in the church of St. Peter, Oxon.\" He left two sons, _Jacob_ and\r\n_Tillemant_. Tillemant became a master coachman between Oxford and\r\nLondon, but having had the misfortune to break his leg, became one of\r\nthe beadles of the university. In the preface to Mr. Nicholls's late\r\ncurious work on autographs, among other _albums_, in the British Museum,\r\nit mentions that of David Krein, in which is the autograph of Jacob\r\nBobart, with these verses;--\r\n\r\n             ----\"virtus sua gloria.\r\n\r\n   Think that day lost whose descending sun\r\n   Views from thy hand no noble action done.\r\n\r\n         Yr success and happyness\r\n               is sincerely wished by\r\n                     Ja. Bobart, Oxford.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears from Ray's History of Plants, that Jacob Bobart, the son, was\r\na frequent communicator to him of scarce plants. It was this son who\r\npublished the second volume of Morrison's Oxford History of Plants, who\r\nwrote its excellent preface, and who engaged _Burghers_ to engrave many\r\nof the new plants; which engravings are highly commended by Pulteney.\r\nMr. Johnson, in page 148 of his History of Gardening, thus pays Bobart a\r\nhigh compliment:--\"a phalanx of botanists were then contemporaries,\r\nwhich previous ages never equalled, nor succeeding ones surpassed. Ray,\r\nTournefort, Plumier, Plukenet, Commelin, Rivinus, _Bobart_, Petiver,\r\nSherard, Boccone, Linnaeus, may be said to have lived in the same age.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES GARDINER. His portrait is engraved by Vertue, from after Verelst,\r\nand prefixed to his translation of _Rapin on Gardens_, 8vo. second\r\nedition; no date. A third edition, 8vo. 1728. I believe he also wrote\r\n\"On the Beatitudes;\" 2 vols. 8vo. Switzer says, that this \"incomparable\r\nLatin poem was translated by an ingenious and worthily dignified\r\nclergyman, and a great lover of gardening, Mr. Gardiner, Sub-Dean of\r\nLincoln.\" He became afterwards (I believe) Bishop of Lincoln; and a\r\nLatin epitaph on this bishop is in Peck's _Desid. Curiosa._ There is a\r\nprint of \"Jacobus Gardiner, Episc. Lincoln,\" engraved by George White,\r\nfrom after Dahl.\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM TEMPLE. The portraits of this worthy man are numerous.\r\nVanderbane's engraving, from Sir Peter Lely's, is particularly fine.\r\nVertue's engravings, from Sir Peter, in the folio editions of 1720 and\r\n1740, are also fine. This same portrait is neatly engraved in the late\r\nMr. Nichol's Collection of Poems. Houbraken has also engraved the same\r\nfor Birch's Lives. Sir William Temple, after spending twenty years in\r\nnegociations with foreign powers, retired in 1680 from public life, and\r\nemployed his time in literary pursuits. He was ambassador for many years\r\nat the court of Holland, and there acquired his knowledge and taste in\r\ngardening. He had a garden at Sheen, and afterwards, another at Moor\r\nPark, where he died in 1700; and though his body was buried in\r\nWestminster Abbey, his heart was enclosed in a silver urn under a\r\nsun-dial in the latter garden. His Essay \"Upon the Gardens of Epicurus,\r\nor of Gardening in the year 1685,\" is printed in all the editions of his\r\nworks.[70] These works are published in 2 vols. folio, and 4 vols. 8vo.\r\nSwitzer, in his History of Gardening, first published in 1715, says,\r\n\"That he was a great lover of gardening, appears by his own writings,\r\nand several kinds of fruit brought over by him out of Holland, &c. as\r\nwell as by the testimony of his neighbours _yet living_, the greatest\r\nconsolation of his life being, in the lucid intervals he had from public\r\nemploys, in his beloved gardens at _Sheen_.\" And, in his Fruit Gardener\r\nhe says, that \"the magnificence and generosity of this great lover of\r\nplanting, distributed vast numbers of the finest grapes among the\r\nnurserymen about London, as well as amongst the nobility and gentry.\"\r\nLord Mountmorris thus speaks of him:--\"The retirement of this great man\r\nhas bequeathed the most invaluable legacy to posterity. Of the taste and\r\nelegance of his writings too much can never be said, illuminated as they\r\nare by that probity and candour which pervade them, and those charms\r\nwhich render truth irresistible. Though other writers may be more the\r\nobjects of imitation to the scholar, yet his style is certainly the best\r\nadapted to the politician and the man of fashion; nor would such an\r\nopinion be given, were it not for an anecdote of Swift, which I had from\r\nthe late Mr. Sheridan, who told me the dean always recommended him as\r\nthe best model, and had repeatedly said that the style of Sir William\r\nTemple was the easiest, the most liberal, and the most brilliant\r\nin our language. In a word, when we consider his probity, his\r\ndisinterestedness, his contempt of wealth, the genuine beauty of his\r\nstyle, which was as brilliant, as harmonious, and as pure as his life\r\nand manners; when we reflect upon the treasures which he has bequeathed\r\nby his example and by his works to his country, which no man ever loved\r\nbetter, or esteemed more; we cannot avoid considering Sir William Temple\r\nas one of the greatest characters which has appeared upon the political\r\nstage; and he may be justly classed with the greatest names of\r\nantiquity, and with the most brilliant characters which adorn and\r\nillustrate the Grecian or Roman annals.\" Mr. Mason, in his English\r\nGarden, contrasts Sir William's idea of \"a perfect garden,\" with those\r\nof Lord Bacon, and Milton; but he candidly says,\r\n\r\n                        ----and yet full oft\r\n   O'er Temple's studious hour did truth preside,\r\n   Sprinkling her lustre o'er his classic page;\r\n   There hear his candour own, in fashion's spite,\r\n   In spite of courtly dulness hear it own,\r\n   _There is a grace in wild variety\r\n   Surpassing rule and order._ Temple, yes,\r\n   There is a grace; and let eternal wreaths\r\n   Adorn their brows who fixt its empire here.\"\r\n\r\nHe then, in glowing lines, pays an animated tribute to Addison, Pope,\r\nand Kent. Hume records that \"he was full of honour and humanity.\" Sir\r\nWilliam thus concludes one of his philosophic essays:--\"When this is\r\ndone, human life is, at the greatest and the best, but like a froward\r\nchild, that must be played with and humoured a little to keep it quiet\r\ntill it falls asleep, and then the care is over.\" His garden was one of\r\nhis last delights. He knew what kind of life was best fitted to make a\r\nman's last days happy. Mr. Walpole, though he censures Sir William's\r\nwarm panegyric on the garden at Moor Park, yet scruples not doing him\r\nfull justice, in styling him an excellent man, and an admired writer,\r\nwhose style, as to his garden, is animated with the colouring and glow\r\nof poetry. Mr. Cobbett, in his _English Gardener_, thus deplores the\r\nfate of Moor Park:--\"This really wise and excellent man, Sir W. Temple,\r\nwho, while he possessed the soundest judgment, and was employed in some\r\nof the greatest concerns of his country, so ardently, yet so rationally\r\nand unaffectedly, praises the pursuits of gardening, in which he\r\ndelighted from his youth to his old age; and of his taste in which, he\r\ngave such delightful proofs in those gardens and grounds at Moor Park,\r\nbeneath the turf of one spot of which, he caused by his will, his heart\r\nto be buried, and which spot, together with all the rest of the\r\nbeautiful arrangement, has been torn about and disfigured within the\r\nlast fifty years, by a succession of wine merchants, spirit merchants,\r\nWest Indians, and God knows what besides.\" And, in his _Woodlands_, he\r\nsays, \"I have stood for hours, when a little boy, looking at this object\r\n(the canal and borders of beautiful flowers at Moor Park); I have\r\ntravelled far since, and have seen a great deal; but I have never seen\r\nany thing of the gardening kind so beautiful in the whole course of my\r\nlife.\" Mr. Johnson, in his History of English Gardening, after noticing\r\nmany general particulars of Sir William, devotes an interesting page to\r\nSir William's attachment to gardening; and every line in this generous\r\npage, betrays his own delight in this art. He thus concludes this\r\npage:--\"Nothing can demonstrate more fully the delight he took in\r\ngardening, than the direction left in his will, that his heart should be\r\nburied beneath the sun-dial of his garden, at Moor Park, near Farnham,\r\nin Surrey. In accordance with which, it was deposited there in a silver\r\nbox, affording another instance of the ruling passion unweakened even in\r\ndeath. Nor was this an unphilosophical clinging to that which it was\r\nimpossible to retain; but rather that grateful feeling, common to our\r\nnature, of desiring finally to repose where in life we have been happy.\r\nIn his garden, Sir William Temple had spent the calmest hours of a\r\nwell-spent life, and where his heart had been most peaceful, he wished\r\nits dust to mingle, and thus, at the same time, offering his last\r\ntestimony to the sentiment, that in a garden\r\n\r\n   _Hic secura quies, et nescia fallere vita._\"\r\n\r\nJOHN LOCKE wrote \"Observations upon the Growth of Vines and Olives; the\r\nProduction of Silk, the Preservation of Fruits. Written at the request\r\nof the Earl of Shaftesbury; now first printed from the original\r\nmanuscript in the possession of the present Earl of Shaftesbury, 1s. 6d.\r\nSandby, 1766.\" Among the many portraits we have of this learned man, the\r\npublic are indebted to Lord King, for having prefixed to his Life of Mr.\r\nLocke, a very fine portrait of him, from after Greenhill. This great and\r\ngood man possessed, in the highest degree, those virtues that have\r\ngiven him a claim to the highest rank in the admiration of posterity. In\r\nRutter's delineations of a part of Somersetshire, he gives a neat\r\nwood-cut of the cottage at Wrington, wherein Locke was born, and he\r\ninforms us, that in the garden belonging to Mrs. Hannah More, near that\r\nvillage, she has placed an urn commemorative of Locke, which was a gift\r\nto her from the justly celebrated Mrs. Montague. He was drawn also by\r\nKneller. Bromley gives a list of many of his engraved portraits.\r\nHoubraken engraved one for Birch's Lives. Vertue gave two engravings\r\nfrom Kneller.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM FLEETWOOD, successively Bishop of St. Asaph and Ely, and who\r\ndied in 1723, was author of \"Curiosities of Nature and Art in Husbandry\r\nand Gardening,\" 8vo. 1707. His portrait is prefixed to his \"Sermons on\r\nthe Relative Duties,\" 8vo. 1716; and also to his \"Essay on the\r\nMiracles.\" His works were published in a collected form in 1 vol. folio,\r\n1737. He was incontestibly the best preacher in his time. Dr. Doddridge\r\ncalls him \"silver tongued.\" Pope's line of\r\n\r\n   _The gracious dew of pulpit eloquence_,\r\n\r\nmight, no doubt, have been justly applied to him. Dr. Drake, in the\r\nthird volume of his Essays, to illustrate the Tatler, Spectator, and\r\nGuardian, has some interesting pages respecting him. His benevolent\r\nheart and exemplary life, added great effect to his persuasive eloquence\r\nin the pulpit. \"His sermons (says Lempriere), and divinity tracts, were\r\nwidely circulated; but the firmness of his opinions drew upon him the\r\ncensure of the House of Commons. His preface to his sermons on the\r\ndeaths of Mary, the Duke of Gloucester, and of William, and on the\r\naccession of Anne, gave such offence to the ministry, that the book was\r\npublicly burnt in 1712; but it was more universally read, and even\r\nappeared in the Spectator, No. 384.\" As to this burning, Dr. Johnson\r\nremarked, that fire is a conclusive, but not a convincing argument; it\r\nwill certainly destroy any book, but it refutes none.[71] In an\r\n_Obituary_, preserved in Peck's Desid. Curiosa, it thus mentions the\r\ndeath of a Jeffery Fleetwood, \"leaving a wife and six little children\r\nbehind him. God bless them. One of these little children was the famous\r\nWilliam Fleetwood, Bishop of Ely.\"\r\n\r\nJOSEPH ADDISON, Esq. There is an original portrait of this eminent man,\r\nat Holland House. Another at Oxford. Noble's continuation of Granger\r\nenumerates several engravings of him, from Kneller's portraits. Dayl,\r\nthe painter, also drew him. His portrait appears in the Kit Cat Club. In\r\nIreland's \"Picturesque Views on the River Avon,\" he gives an interesting\r\ndescription of Mr. Addison's house at Bilton, near Rugby, two miles from\r\nDunchurch; with a view of the same. The house \"remains precisely in the\r\nstate it was at the decease of its former possessor, nor has the\r\ninterior suffered much change in its former decoration. The furniture\r\nand pictures hold their places with an apparent sacred attention to his\r\nmemory. Among the latter, are three of himself, at different periods of\r\nhis life; in each of which is strongly marked with the pencil, the ease\r\nof the gentleman, and the open and ingenuous character of the friend to\r\nhumanity.\" From Dr. Drake's Biographical Sketch of Addison, it appears,\r\nthat these portraits were still remaining in his house in 1797. A copy\r\nof the above view is given in the Monthly Magazine for February, 1822,\r\nand it there says, that \"the spacious gardens retain the fashion of the\r\nage of the Spectator.\" The origin of the modern style of landscape\r\ngardening, or the first writers on that subject, were unquestionably Mr.\r\nAddison, in Nos. 414 and 477 of the _Spectator_, and Mr. Pope in his\r\ncelebrated _Guardian_. The first artists who practised in this style,\r\nwere Bridgman and Kent.[72] Mr. Addison's pure taste on these subjects\r\nis visible even where he prefers Fontainebleau to the magnificent\r\nVersailles, in his paper in the _Guardian_, No. 101:--\"It is situated\r\namong rocks and woods, that give you a fine variety of savage prospects.\r\nThe king has humoured the genius of the place, and only made use of so\r\nmuch art as is necessary to help and regulate nature, without reforming\r\nher too much. The cascades seem to break through the clefts and cracks\r\nof rocks that are covered over with moss, and look as if they were piled\r\nupon one another by accident. There is an artificial wildness in the\r\nmeadows, walks, and canals; and the garden, instead of a wall, is fenced\r\non the lower end by a natural mound of rock-work that strikes the eye\r\nvery agreeably. For my part, I think there is something more charming in\r\nthese rude heaps of stone than in so many statues, and would as soon see\r\na river winding through woods and meadows, as when it is tossed up in so\r\nmany whimsical figures at Versailles.\" In No. 414 of his Spectator, he\r\nsays, \"English gardens are not so entertaining to the fancy as those in\r\nFrance, and Italy, where we see a large extent of ground covered over\r\nwith an agreeable mixture of garden, and forest, which represent every\r\nwhere an artificial rudeness, much more charming than that neatness and\r\nelegancy which we meet with in those of our own country.\" Mr. Murphy\r\nthus compares Addison with Johnson:--\"Addison lends grace and ornament\r\nto truth; Johnson gives it force and energy. Addison makes virtue\r\namiable; Johnson represents it as an awful duty.\" Addison has been\r\ncalled the English Fenelon. Johnson calls him the Raphael of essay\r\nwriters. The imposing and commanding attitude of the statue erected a\r\nfew years since in the Poets' Corner, seems to have arisen, and to have\r\nbeen devoted to his memory, from his _Reflections on the Tombs in the\r\nAbbey_. Those reflections I here subjoin; and I am sure my reader will\r\nagree with me, that I could not offer a purer honour to his genius and\r\nmemory:--\"No.26, Friday, March 30.\r\n\r\n   _Pallida mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas\r\n     Regumque turres, O beate sexti.\r\n   Vitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchoare longam,\r\n     Jam te premet nox, fabulaeque manes,\r\n   Et domus exilis Plutonia._--HOR.\r\n\r\n   With equal foot, rich friend, impartial fate\r\n   Knocks at the cottage, and the palace gate:\r\n   Life's span forbids thee to extend thy cares,\r\n   And stretch thy hopes beyond thy tender years:\r\n   Night soon will seize, and you must quickly go\r\n   To storied ghosts, and _Pluto's_ house below.--CREECH.\r\n\r\n\"When I am in a serious humour, I very often walk by myself in\r\nWestminster Abbey; where the gloominess of the place, and the use to\r\nwhich it is applied, with the solemnity of the building, and the\r\ncondition of the people who lie in it, are apt to fill the mind with a\r\nkind of melancholy, or rather thoughtfulness, that is not disagreeable.\r\nI yesterday passed a whole afternoon in the church-yard, the cloisters,\r\nand the church, amusing myself with the tomb-stones and inscriptions\r\nthat I met with in those several regions of the dead. Most of them\r\nrecorded nothing else of the buried person, but that he was born upon\r\none day and died upon another: the whole history of his life being\r\ncomprehended in those two circumstances, that are common to all mankind.\r\nI could not but look upon these registers of existence, whether of brass\r\nor marble, as a kind of satire upon the departed persons; who had left\r\nno other memorial of them, but that they were born and that they died.\r\nThey put me in mind of several persons mentioned in the battles of\r\nheroic poems, who have sounding names given them, for no other reason\r\nbut that they may be killed, and are celebrated for nothing but being\r\nknocked on the head.\r\n\r\n   _Glaucumque, Medontaque, Thersilochumque._--VIRG.\r\n\r\n\"The life of these men is finely described in holy writ by _the path of\r\nan arrow_, which is immediately closed up and lost. Upon my going into\r\nthe church, I entertained myself with the digging of a grave; and saw in\r\nevery shovel-full of it that was thrown up, the fragment of a bone or\r\nskull intermixed with a kind of fresh mouldering earth that some time or\r\nother had a place in the composition of an human body. Upon this I began\r\nto consider with myself what innumerable multitudes of people lay\r\nconfused together under the pavement of that ancient cathedral; how men\r\nand women, friends and enemies, priests and soldiers, monks and\r\nprebendaries, were crumbled amongst one another, and blended together in\r\nthe same common mass; how beauty, strength, and youth, with old age,\r\nweakness, and deformity, lay undistinguished in the same promiscuous\r\nheap of matter. After having thus surveyed this great magazine of\r\nmortality, as it were in the lump; I examined it more particularly by\r\nthe accounts which I found on several of the monuments which are raised\r\nin every quarter of that ancient fabrick. Some of them were covered with\r\nsuch extravagant epitaphs, that if it were possible for the dead person\r\nto be acquainted with them, he would blush at the praises which his\r\nfriends have bestowed upon him. There are others so excessively modest,\r\nthat they deliver the character of the person departed in _Greek_ or\r\n_Hebrew_, and by that means are not understood once in a twelvemonth. In\r\nthe poetical quarter, I found there were poets who had no monuments, and\r\nmonuments which had no poets. I observed indeed that the present war had\r\nfilled the church with many of these uninhabited monuments, which had\r\nbeen erected to the memory of persons whose bodies were buried in the\r\nplains of _Blenheim_, or in the bosom of the ocean. I could not but be\r\nvery much delighted with several modern epitaphs, which are written with\r\ngreat elegance of expression and justness of thought, and therefore do\r\nhonour to the living as well as to the dead. As a foreigner is very apt\r\nto conceive an idea of the ignorance or politeness of a nation from the\r\nturn of their public monuments and inscriptions, they should be\r\nsubmitted to the perusal of men of learning and genius before they are\r\nput in execution. Sir_Cloudesly Shovel's_ monument has very often given\r\nme great offence: instead of the brave rough _English_ admiral, which\r\nwas the distinguishing character of that plain gallant man, he is\r\nrepresented on his tomb by the figure of a beau, dressed in a long\r\nperiwig, and reposing himself upon velvet cushions under a canopy of\r\nstate. The inscription is answerable to the monument; for, instead of\r\ncelebrating the many remarkable actions he had performed in the service\r\nof his country, it acquaints us only with the manner of his death, in\r\nwhich it was impossible for him to reap any honour. The _Dutch_, whom we\r\nare apt to despise for want of genius, shew an infinitely greater taste\r\nof antiquity and politeness in their buildings and works of this nature,\r\nthan what we meet with in those of our own country. The monuments of\r\ntheir admirals, which have been erected at the public expense, represent\r\nthem like themselves; and are adorned with rostral crowns and naval\r\nornaments, with beautiful festoons of sea-weed, shells, and coral. But\r\nto return to our subject. I have left the repository of our English\r\nkings for the contemplation of another day, when I shall find my mind\r\ndisposed for so serious an amusement. I know that entertainments of this\r\nnature are apt to raise dark and dismal thoughts in timorous minds, and\r\ngloomy imaginations; but, for my own part, though I am always serious,\r\nI do not know what it is to be melancholy; and can therefore take a view\r\nof nature in her deep and solemn scenes, with the same pleasure as in\r\nher most gay and delightful ones. By this means I can improve myself\r\nwith those objects which others consider with terror. When I look upon\r\nthe tombs of the great, every emotion of envy dies in me; when I read\r\nthe epitaphs of the beautiful, every inordinate desire goes out; when I\r\nmeet with the grief of parents upon a tomb-stone, my heart melts with\r\ncompassion; when I see the tomb of the parents themselves, I consider\r\nthe vanity of grieving for those whom we must quickly follow: When I see\r\nkings lying by those who deposed them, when I consider rival wits placed\r\nside by side, or the holy men that divided the world with their contests\r\nand disputes, I reflect with sorrow and astonishment on the little\r\ncompetitions, factions, and debates of mankind. When I read the several\r\ndates of the tombs, of some that died yesterday, and some six hundred\r\nyears ago, I consider that great day when we shall all of us be\r\ncontemporaries, and make our appearance together.\"[73]\r\n\r\n\r\nREV. JOHN LAWRENCE published \"The Clergyman's Recreation, shewing the\r\nPleasure and Profit of the Art of Gardening;\" 8vo. 1714. Also a poem,\r\ncalled \"Paradise Regained, or the Art of Gardening;\" 8vo. 1728. The\r\nsixth edition of \"The Clergyman's Recreation\" has \"the effigies of the\r\nauthor, engraved by Vertue.\" I have seen eight copies of this sixth\r\nedition, and in neither of them has this portrait been. No doubt the\r\ncollecting to form Granger's, has deprived each copy of its portrait.\r\nThis is an expressive portrait, ornamented with a vine wreath, and with\r\na rich cornucopia or clusters of ripe fruit. The original picture from\r\nwhich Vertue's print was taken, was at Pallion, near Durham, the seat of\r\nhis grandson, John Goodchild, Esq. In Rodd's catalogue of engraved\r\nportraits, printed a few years ago, was \"John Lawrence, prebend of\r\nSalisbury, _original drawing by Vertue_, price 5s.\" Mr. Lawrence\r\npublished also, in folio, in 1726, his System of Agriculture and\r\nGardening. Mr. Nichols, in vol. iv. of his Literary Anecdotes, has given\r\na list of all his works, has preserved a few particulars respecting him,\r\nand pays a just tribute to him. A list of his works may also be seen in\r\nWatts's Bibl. Brit., and in Mr. Johnson's work. The Encycl. of Gardening\r\ninforms us that he was \"of a hospitable and benevolent disposition,\r\ntaking great pleasure in presenting a rich dessert of fruit to his\r\nfriends.\" He was presented to the rectory of Yelvertoft,\r\nNorthamptonshire, in 1703, \"by the extraordinary uncommon bounty of a\r\ngenerous patron.\" In 1721, he was presented to that of Bishop's\r\nWearmouth, Durham, where he died in 1732. He was also a prebend of\r\nSalisbury.[74]\r\n\r\nMr. Lawrence thus enforces the pleasures of a garden, to his own\r\norder:--\"to make them happy by loving an innocent diversion, the\r\namusements of a garden being not only most delightful to those that love\r\nthem, but most wholesome to those that use them. A good man knows how to\r\nrecapitulate all his pleasures in a devout lifting up of his hands, his\r\neyes and his heart, to the great and bountiful author of nature, who\r\ngives beauty, relish, and success to all our honest labours.\" His pen\r\nlikewise paints with \"soft and tempting colours,\" the extreme beauty of\r\nour fruit-trees, when clothed with their different coloured blossoms,\r\n(what Lord Byron calls _the sweet and blooming fruits of\r\nearth_):--\"What a pleasing entertainment is it to the eye, to behold\r\nthe apricot in its full blossom, white as snow, and at the same time the\r\npeach with its crimson-coloured blooms; both beginning to be\r\ninterspersed with green leaves! These are succeeded by the pear, the\r\ncherry, and the plum, whose blossoms and leaves make a very beautiful\r\nmixture in the spring; and it cannot be a less pleasant sight to see\r\nclusters of swelling fruit all the summer, as the earnest of the full\r\ngratification of another sense in autumn. And now we have come hither,\r\nwhat painter can draw a landskip more charming and beautiful to the eye,\r\nthan an old Newington peach-tree laden with fruit in August, when the\r\nsun has first begun to paint one side of the fruit with such soft and\r\ntempting colours? The apricot, the pear, the cherry and plum, when they\r\nappear in plenty as they ought, present themselves to the eye at the\r\ntime of ripening in very inviting blushes. In short, all the several\r\nsorts of fruit trees have such pleasing varieties, that were there no\r\nother sense to be gratified but the sight, they may vie with a parterre\r\neven of the finest flowers.\" He thus mentions the month of _July_:--\"How\r\nbeautiful and refreshing are the mornings and evenings of such days,\r\nwhen the very air is perfumed with pleasant odours, and every thing that\r\npresents itself to the eye gives fresh occasion to the devout admirer to\r\npraise and adore the Great Creator, who hath given such wisdom and power\r\nto man to diversify nature in such various instances, and (for his own\r\nuse, pleasure, and profit,) to assist her in all her operations.\" This\r\nworthy clergyman might have applied to the delights of a garden, the\r\nsacred words of scripture:--\"her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all\r\nher paths are peace.\"[75]\r\n\r\nALEXANDER POPE. Numerous are the engraved portraits of this graceful and\r\nharmonious poet. Noble's continuation of Granger, gives all, or the\r\ngreater part of the engravings from his portraits, from which it will be\r\nseen, that he was drawn by Kneller, by Richardson, by many others, and\r\nparticularly by his friend Jervas. As a portrait painter, Mr. Jervas\r\nwas far from eminent. Pope's attachment to him, however, has enshrined\r\nhis name in glowing lines to future generations. The portraits of Pope\r\nwhich Jervas drew, were done _con amore_. Mr. Jennings, of Cheapside,\r\nhas prefixed to his elegant folio edition of the \"Essay on Man,\" a\r\n_whole-length_ of Mr. Pope, from after Jervas. In Dodsley's Collection\r\nof Poems, vol. iii. is a very striking bust of Mr. Pope, as an\r\naccompaniment to Mr. Dodsley's affecting poem to his memory, which he\r\nentitles _The Cave of Pope_. Surely this bust must have strongly\r\nresembled Pope, or Mr. Dodsley would not have inserted it. The profile\r\nto Ruffhead's Life, in 4to. 1769, _must_ have been a likeness, or Bishop\r\nWarburton would not have permitted its insertion. His age was then\r\ntwenty-four. It is finely engraved by Ravenet, from Kneller. It is a\r\nstriking portrait. A copy of this is admirably engraved in Bell's Poets,\r\nrichly ornamented. A copy from that by Richardson is prefixed to\r\nWarton's edition. Among the portraits at _Hagley_, is that of Pope, and\r\nhis dog Bounce, by Richardson.[76] Lord Chesterfield thus speaks of\r\nPope:--\"His poor, crazy, deformed body, was a mere Pandora's box,\r\ncontaining all the physical ills that ever afflicted humanity. This,\r\nperhaps, whetted the edge of his satire, and may, in some degree, excuse\r\nit. I will say nothing of his works; they speak sufficiently for\r\nthemselves; they will live as long as taste and letters shall remain in\r\nthis country, and be more and more admired, as envy and resentment shall\r\nsubside. But I will venture this piece of classical blasphemy: which is,\r\nthat however he may be supposed to be obliged to Horace, Horace is more\r\nobliged to him.\" Mr. Ruffhead (generally supposed to have had his\r\ninformation from Dr. Warburton) thus states:--\"Mr. Pope was low in\r\nstature, and of a diminutive and misshapen figure, which no one\r\nridiculed more pleasantly than himself. His constitution was naturally\r\ntender and delicate, and in his temper he was naturally mild and\r\ngentle, yet sometimes betrayed that exquisite sensibility which is the\r\nconcomitant of genius. His lively perception and delicate feeling,\r\nirritated by wretched ill health, made him too quickly take fire, but\r\nhis good sense and humanity soon rendered him placable. With regard to\r\nthe extent of his genius, it was so wide and various, that perhaps it\r\nmay not be too much to say, that he excelled in every species of\r\ncomposition; and, beside his excellence as a poet, he was both an\r\nantiquarian and an architect, and neither in an inferior degree.[77] No\r\nman ever entertained more exalted notions of friendship, or was ever\r\nmore sincere, steady, warm, and disinterested, in all his attachments.\r\nEvery inch of his heart was let out in lodgings for his friends.\" Lord\r\nOrrery thus speaks of him:--\"His prose writings are little less\r\nharmonious than his verse; and his voice, in common conversation, was so\r\nnaturally musical, that I remember honest Tom Southern used to call him\r\nthe Little Nightingale; his manners were delicate, easy, and engaging;\r\nhe treated his friends with a politeness that charmed, and a generosity\r\nthat was much to his honour. Every guest was made happy within his\r\ndoors; pleasure dwelt under his roof, and elegance presided at his\r\ntable.\" One may trace Mr. Pope's hospitality throughout his letters. I\r\nwill merely select one or two instances. In a letter to _Swift_, he\r\nsays, \"My house is too large; my gardens furnish too much wood and\r\nprovision for _my_ use. My servants are sensible and tender of me. They\r\nhave intermarried, and are become rather low friends than servants.\r\nWould to God you would come over with Lord Orrery, whose care of you in\r\nthe voyage I could so certainly depend on; and bring with you your old\r\nhousekeeper, and two or three servants. I have room for all, a heart for\r\nall, and (think what you will) a fortune for all.\" In another letter to\r\nSwift, he says, \"I wish you had any motive to see this kingdom. I could\r\nkeep you; for I am rich, that is, I have more than I want. I can afford\r\nroom for yourself and two servants. I have, indeed, room enough, nothing\r\nbut myself at home: the kind and hearty housewife is dead! the agreeable\r\nand instructive neighbour is gone! yet my house is enlarged, and the\r\ngardens extend and flourish, as knowing nothing of the guests they have\r\nlost. I have more fruit trees and kitchen garden than you have any\r\nthought of; nay, I have good melons and pineapples of my own growth.\" In\r\na letter to _Mr. Allen_, he says, \"Let me know your day for coming, and\r\nI will have every room in my house as warm for you as the owner always\r\nwould be.\" Mr. Mathias, in his Pursuits of Literature, (besides\r\nexpatiating with fond delight, in numerous pages, on the genius of\r\nPope,) thus speaks of him:--\"Familiar with the great, intimate with the\r\npolite, graced by the attentions of the fair, admired by the learned, a\r\nfavourite with the nation, independent in an acquired opulence, the\r\nhonourable product of his genius, and of his industry; the companion of\r\npersons distinguished for their virtue, birth, high fashion, rank, or\r\nwit, and resident in the centre of all public information and\r\nintelligence; every avenue to knowledge, and every mode of observation\r\nwere open to his curious, prying, piercing, and unwearied\r\nintellect.\"[78]\r\n\r\nOne may with truth further apply to Mr. Pope what was said of Buchanan,\r\nthat his mind was stored with all the fire, and all the graces of\r\nancient literature. Mr. Pope's attachment to _gardens_, appears not only\r\nin his letter to Martha Blount, describing Sir W. Raleigh's seat--but in\r\nhis own garden at Twickenham, (where, as Mr. Loudon feelingly observes,\r\n_only the soil of which now remains_)--and in his letter to Mr. Blount,\r\ndescribing his grotto--but it also bursts forth in many passages\r\nthroughout his works--and in his celebrated _Guardian_ (No. 173), which\r\nattacks, with the keenest wit, \"our study to recede from nature,\" in our\r\ngiants made out of yews, and lavender pigs with sage growing in their\r\nbellies. His epistle to Lord Burlington confirms the charms he felt in\r\nstudying nature. Mr. Mason, in a note to his English Garden, says, \"I\r\nhad before called Bacon the prophet, and Milton, the herald of true\r\ntaste in gardening. The former, because, in developing the constituent\r\nproperties of a princely garden, he had largely expatiated upon that\r\nadorned natural wildness which we now deem the essence of the art. The\r\nlatter, on account of his having made this natural wildness the leading\r\nidea in his exquisite description of Paradise. I here call Addison,\r\n_Pope_, Kent, &c. the champions of this true taste.\" As Mr. Mason has\r\nadded an _&c._, may we not add to these respected names, that of honest\r\nold Bridgman? It was the determination of Lord Byron (had his life been\r\nlonger spared), to have erected, at his own expence, a monument to\r\nPope.[79] We can gather even from his rapid and hurried \"Letter on the\r\nRev. W. L. Bowles's Strictures,\" his attachment to the high name of\r\nPope:--\"If Lucretius had not been spoiled by the Epicurean system, we\r\nshould have had a far superior poem to any now in existence. As mere\r\npoetry, it is the first of Latin poems. What then has ruined it? His\r\nethics. Pope has not this defect; his moral is as pure as his poetry is\r\nglorious.\"--\"Pope's charities were his own, and they were noble and\r\nextensive, far beyond his fortune's warrant.\"--\"I have loved and\r\nhonoured the fame and name of that illustrious and unrivalled man, far\r\nmore than my own paltry renown, and the trashy jingle of the crowd of\r\nschools and upstarts, who pretend to rival, or even surpass him. Sooner\r\nthan a single leaf should be torn from _his_ laurel, it were better that\r\nall which these men, and that I, as one of their set, have ever\r\nwritten, should\r\n\r\n   Line trunks, clothe spice, or, fluttering in a row,\r\n   Befringe the rails of Bedlam, or Soho.\"\r\n\r\n\"The most _perfect_ of our poets, and the purest of our moralists.\"--\"He\r\nis the _moral_ poet of all civilization; and, as such, let us hope that\r\nhe will one day be the national poet of mankind. He is the only poet\r\nthat never shocks; the only poet whose _faultlessness_ has been made his\r\nreproach. Cast your eye over his productions; consider their extent, and\r\ncontemplate their variety:--pastoral, passion, mock-heroic, translation,\r\nsatire, ethics,--all excellent, and often perfect. If his great charm be\r\nhis _melody_, how comes it that foreigners adore him even in their\r\ndiluted translations?\"[80]\r\n\r\nMr. Mason has also farther recorded the resplendent fame of this\r\ncelebrated man; for in his _Musaeus_, a monody to the memory of Pope, he\r\ninvokes the shades of Chaucer, Spencer, and Milton, to do homage to his\r\ndeparting spirit:--\r\n\r\n                 ----to cheer thee at this rueful time\r\n   While black death doth on thy heart-strings prey.\r\n   So may we greet thee with a nobler strain,\r\n   When soon we meet for aye in yon star-sprinkled plain.\r\n\r\nMilton thus begins _his_ homage:--\r\n\r\n   Thrice hail, thou heaven-taught warbler, last and best\r\n   Of all the train! Poet, in whom conjoin'd\r\n   All that to ear, or heart, or head, could yield\r\n   Rapture; harmonious, manly, clear, sublime!\r\n   Accept this gratulation: may it cheer\r\n   Thy sinking soul; or these corporeal ills\r\n   Ought daunt thee, nor appal. Know, in high heav'n\r\n   Fame blooms eternal on that spirit divine,\r\n   Who builds immortal verse.\"[81]\r\n\r\nSir E. Brydges, in his \"Letters on the Genius of Lord Byron,\" thus\r\ncharacterizes the grace and sweetness of his pathetic powers, in his\r\n_Eloisa_:--\"When either his passions or imaginations _were_ roused, they\r\nwere deep, strong, and splendid. Notwithstanding _Eloisa_ was an\r\nhistorical subject, his invention of circumstances of detail, his\r\nimagery, the changes and turns of passion, the brilliancy of hues thrown\r\nupon the whole, the eloquence, the tenderness, the fire, the inimitable\r\ngrace and felicity of language, were all the fruits of creative genius.\r\nThis poem stands alone in its kind; never anticipated, and never likely\r\nto be approached hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nYoung uttered this sublime apostrophe when the death of Pope was first\r\nannounced to him:--\r\n\r\n   _Thou, who couldst make immortals_, art thou dead?\r\n\r\nOf his _Essay on Man_, the Nouveau Dict. Hist. Portatif thus\r\nspeaks:--\"Une metaphysique lumineuse, ornee des charmes de la poesie,\r\nune morale touchante, dont les lecons penetrent le coeur et\r\nconvainquent l'esprit, des peintures vives, ou l'homme apprend a se\r\nconnoitre, pour apprendre a deviner meilleur; tels sont les principaux\r\ncaracteres qui distinguent le poeme Anglois. Son imagination est\r\negalement sage et feconde, elle prodigue les pensees neunes, et donne le\r\npiquant de la nouveante, aux pensees anciennes; il embelloit les\r\nmatieres les plus seches, par la coloris d'une elocution noble, facile,\r\nenergeque, variee avec un art infini.\"\r\n\r\nIn the gardens of Stowe is the following inscription to\r\n\r\n                       ALEXANDER POPE,\r\n           Who, uniting the correctness of judgment\r\n                    To the fire of genius,\r\n           By the melody and power of his numbers,\r\n        Gave sweetness to sense, and grace to philosophy.\r\n          He employed the pointed brilliancy of his wit\r\n                    To chastise the vices,\r\n                 And the eloquence of poetry\r\n             To exalt the virtues of human nature;\r\n           And, being without a rival in his own age,\r\n   Imitated and translated with a spirit equal to the originals,\r\n                   The best Poets of antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM KENT, whose portrait appears in Mr. Dallaway's rich edition of\r\nthe Anecdotes of Painting. Kent, with Bridgman, Pope, and Addison, have\r\nbeen termed the fathers of landscape gardening.[82] Mr. Walpole, after\r\nreviewing the old formal style of our gardens, in language which it is\r\npainful to me thus only to advert to, instead of copying at length, (for\r\nI am fully \"aware of the mischiefs which generally ensue in _meddling_\r\nwith the productions of genius\"); and after stating that when _nature_\r\nwas taken into the plan, every step pointed out new beauties, and\r\ninspired new ideas: \"at that moment appeared Kent, painter enough to\r\ntaste the charms of landscape, bold and opiniative enough to dare and to\r\ndictate, and born with a genius to strike out a great system from the\r\ntwilight of imperfect essays. He leaped the fence, and saw that all\r\nnature was a garden. Thus the pencil of his imagination bestowed all the\r\narts of landscape on the scenes he handled. But of all the beauties he\r\nadded to the face of this beautiful country, none surpassed his\r\nmanagement of water. Thus, dealing in none but the colours of nature,\r\nand catching its most favourable features, men saw a new creation\r\nopening before their eyes.\" And again he calls him \"the inventor of an\r\nart that realizes painting, and improves nature: Mahomet imagined an\r\nelysium, but Kent created many.\" The greatest of all authorities tells\r\nus, that in Esher's peaceful grove, both\r\n\r\n   Kent and Nature vied for Pelham's love.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason, in his English Garden, thus panegyrises his elysian scenes:--\r\n\r\n                       ---- Kent, who felt\r\n   The pencil's power; but fix'd by higher hopes\r\n   Of beauty than that pencil knew to paint,\r\n   Work'd with the living lives that _nature_ lent,\r\n   And realized his landscapes.\r\n\r\nMr. Pope, as well as Kent, would, and Mr. Walpole, and Mr. Mason, must\r\neach of them have read with high approbation the following remark of the\r\nlate Sir Uvedale Price:--\"the noble and varied works of the eminent\r\npainters of every age and every country, and those of their supreme\r\nmistress, Nature, should be the great models of imitation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Whateley paints in glowing language, the genius of Kent, both at\r\nStowe, and at Claremont. Mr. George Mason thus honestly and finely\r\npleads for him:--\"According to my own ideas, all that has since been\r\ndone by the most deservedly admired designers, as Southcote, Hamilton,\r\nLyttleton, Pitt, Shenstone, Morris, for themselves, and by Wright for\r\nothers, all that has been written on the subject, even the gardening\r\ndidactic poem, and the didactic essay on the picturesque, have proceeded\r\nfrom Kent. Had Kent never exterminated the bounds of regularity, never\r\nactually traversed the way to freedom of manner, would any of these\r\ncelebrated artists have found it of themselves? Theoretic hints from the\r\nhighest authorities, had evidently long existed without sufficient\r\neffect. And had not these great masters actually executed what Kent's\r\nexample first inspired, them with, the design of executing, would the\r\nsubsequent writers on gardening have been enabled to collect materials\r\nfor precepts, or stores for their imaginations? Mr. Price acknowledges\r\nhimself an admirer of the water-scene at Blenheim. Would it ever have\r\nappeared in its present shape, if no Kent had previously abolished the\r\nstiffness of canals! If this original artist had barely rescued the\r\nliquid element from the constraint of right lines and angles, that\r\nservice alone would have given him an indubitable claim to the respect\r\nof posterity.\" The Rev. Mr. Coventry, in his admirable exposure of the\r\ngrotesque absurdities in gardening, (being No. 15 of the World) thus\r\nspeaks of Kent:--\"The great Kent at length appeared in behalf of nature,\r\ndeclared war against the taste in fashion, and laid the axe to the root\r\nof artificial evergreens. Gardens were no longer filled with yews in the\r\nshape of giants, Noah's ark cut in holly, St. George and the Dragon in\r\nbox, cypress lovers, laurustine bears, and all that race of root-born\r\nmonsters which flourished so long, and looked so tremendous round the\r\nedges of every grass-plat. The great master above mentioned, truly the\r\ndisciple of nature, imitated her in the agreeable wildness and beautiful\r\nirregularity of her plans, of which there are some noble examples still\r\nremaining, that abundantly show the power of his creative genius.\" Mr.\r\nDallaway, when treating on architecture, in his Anecdotes of the Arts,\r\nsays, \"Kent designed the noble hall at Holkham, terminated by a vast\r\nstaircase, producing, in the whole, an imposing effect of grandeur not\r\nto be equalled in England.\" Kent died in 1748. He was a contemporary\r\ntherefore of Horace Walpole. He was buried in the vault at Chiswick,\r\nbelonging to his friend and patron, Lord Burlington.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIDGMAN'S portrait was a private plate. It exhibited a kind-hearted,\r\nhale old countenance. As he has the honour of being classed with Mr.\r\n_Addison_, and with _Pope_, and _Kent_, as one of the champions who\r\nestablished the picturesque scenery of landscape gardening, (which\r\n_Bacon_, and _Spencer_, and _Milton_, as hath been observed, foresaw)\r\nhis portrait must surely be interesting. The engraved portrait which I\r\nsaw of him more than fifty years ago, made then a strong impression on\r\nme. I think it was an etching. It marked a venerable healthy man. I\r\nneither recollect its painter nor engraver; and it is so scarce, that\r\nneither Mr. Smith, of Lisle Street, nor Mr. Evans, of Great Queen\r\nStreet, the intelligent collectors and illustrators of Granger, have\r\nbeen able to obtain it. Perhaps it will be discovered that it was a\r\nprivate plate, done at the expence of his generous and noble employer,\r\nLord Cobham. Of this once able and esteemed man, I can procure little\r\ninformation. The Encycl. of Gardening says, \"Lord Cobham seems to have\r\nbeen occupied in re-modelling the grounds at _Stowe_, about the same\r\ntime that Pope was laying out his gardens at Twickenham. His lordship\r\nbegan these improvements in 1714, _employing Bridgman_, whose plans and\r\nviews for altering old Stowe from the most rigid character of the\r\nancient style to a more open and irregular design, are still in\r\nexistence. Kent was employed a few years afterwards, first to paint the\r\nhall, and afterwards in the double capacity of architect and\r\nlandscape-gardener; and the finest scenes there are his creation.\" The\r\nfinest views of Stowe gardens were drawn by Rigaud, and published by\r\n_Sarah Bridgman_, in 1739. The fine and magnificent amphitheatre at the\r\nDuke of Newcastle's, at Claremont, was designed, I believe, by Bridgman.\r\nWhen Queen Caroline added nearly three hundred acres from Hyde Park to\r\nthe gardens at Kensington, they were laid out by him. He also laid out\r\nthe gardens at Shardeloes, near Amersham. Mr. Walpole thus mentions\r\nBridgman, after alluding to the shears having been applied to the lovely\r\nwildness of nature: \"Improvements had gone on, till _London_ and _Wise_\r\nhad stocked our gardens with giants, animals, monsters, coats of arms,\r\nand mottos, in yew, box and holly. Absurdity could go no farther, and\r\nthe tide turned. _Bridgman_, the next fashionable designer of gardens,\r\nwas far more chaste; and whether from good sense, or that the nation had\r\nbeen struck and reformed by the admirable paper in the Guardian, No.\r\n173, he banished verdant sculpture, and did not even revert to the\r\nsquare precision of the foregoing age. He enlarged his plans, disdained\r\nto make every division tally to its opposite; and though he still\r\nadhered much to straight walks with high clipped hedges, they were only\r\nhis great lines, the rest he diversified by wilderness and with loose\r\ngroves of oak, though still within surrounding hedges. I have observed\r\nin the garden at Gubbins, in Hertfordshire, many detached thoughts, that\r\nstrongly indicate the dawn of modern taste. As his reformation gained\r\nfooting, he ventured farther, and in the royal garden at Richmond, dared\r\nto introduce cultivated fields, and even morsels of a forest appearance,\r\nby the sides of those endless and tiresome walks that stretched out of\r\none into another without intermission. But this was not till other\r\ninnovators had broke loose too from rigid symmetry. But the capital\r\nstroke, the leading step to all that has followed, was (_I believe the\r\nfirst thought was Bridgman's_) the destruction of walls for boundaries,\r\nand the invention of fosses,--an attempt then deemed so astonishing,\r\nthat the common people called them ha! ha's! to express their surprise\r\nat finding a sudden and unperceived check to their walk.[83] One of the\r\nfirst gardens planted in this simple though still formal style, was my\r\nfather's at Houghton. It was laid out by Mr. Eyre, an imitator of\r\nBridgman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIP MILLER died at the age of eighty, and was emphatically styled by\r\nforeigners _hortulanorum princeps_. Switzer bears testimony to his\r\n\"usual generosity, openness and freedom.\" Professor Martyn says, \"he\r\naccumulated no wealth from his respectable connection with the great, or\r\nfrom the numerous editions of his works. He was of a disposition too\r\ngenerous, and too careless of money, to become rich, and in all his\r\ntransactions observed more attention to integrity and honest fame, than\r\nto any pecuniary advantages.\" There is a finely engraved portrait of Mr.\r\nMiller, by Maillet, prefixed to the \"Dictionnaire des Jardiniers, de\r\nPhilipe Miller, traduit de l'Anglois,\" en 8 tom. 4to. Paris, 1785.\r\n\r\nDr. Pulteney says of him, \"He raised himself by his merit from a state\r\nof obscurity to a degree of eminence, but rarely, if ever before,\r\nequalled in the character of a gardener.\" Mr. Loudon (in that \"varied\r\nand voluminous mass of knowledge,\" his Encyclopaedia), thus\r\nremarks:--\"Miller, during his long career, had no considerable\r\ncompetitor, until he approached the end of it, when several writers took\r\nthe advantage of his unwearied labours of near half a century, and fixed\r\nthemselves upon him, as various marine insects do upon a decaying\r\nshell-fish. I except Hitt and Justice, who are both originals, as is\r\nalso Hill, after his fashion, but his gardening is not much founded in\r\nexperience.\" The sister of Mr. Miller married Ehret, whose fine taste\r\nand botanical accuracy, and whose splendid drawings of plants, are the\r\nfinest ornaments of a botanical library.\r\n\r\nMr. Miller fixed his residence adjoining that part of Chelsea\r\nchurch-yard where he lies interred. He died December 18, 1771. Mr.\r\nJohnson gives a list of his writings, and of the different editions of\r\nhis celebrated Dictionary, which he terms \"this great record of our\r\nart.\" He farther does full justice to him, by associating his name, at\r\np. 147 and p. 151, with that of \"the immortal Swede, whose master mind\r\nreduced the confusion and discord of botany to harmony.\" He calls Miller\r\n\"the perfect botanist and horticulturist.\"[84] The following spirited\r\ntribute to Mr. Miller, appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine for June,\r\n1828:--\r\n\r\n   \"_Chelsea, June 5._\r\n\r\n\"MR. URBAN,--In the first volume, page 250, of the second edition of\r\n_Faulkner's History of Chelsea_, just published, which contains a very\r\ncopious fund of historical, antiquarian, and biographical information, I\r\nfind inserted the monument and epitaph of Philip Miller, who was so\r\njustly styled 'the prince of horticulture' by contemporary botanists,\r\nand whose well-earned fame will last as long as the sciences of botany\r\nand horticulture shall endure. The epitaph of this distinguished man is\r\ncorrectly given; but the historian appears not to have duly appreciated,\r\nif he was even aware of, the circumstances which induced the Fellows of\r\nthe Linnaean and Horticultural Societies of London to erect this grateful\r\ntribute of respectful esteem to him, who in his life-time, had done more\r\nthan any individual, ancient or modern, towards enlarging the boundaries\r\nof the science of horticulture, and very extensively the far more\r\ndifficult one of botany likewise. These he accomplished in the numerous\r\neditions of his unrivalled Dictionary, and in his elaborate\r\nintroductions to botanical knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"The reasons which induced the above-mentioned societies to erect the\r\nmonument in question, were, chiefly, because neither monument, nor tomb,\r\nnor even any recording public notice whatever (the 'monumentum aere\r\nperennius' of his own immortal works excepted) had previously been\r\nprovided by any one.\r\n\r\n\"The relatives of Miller were very few; he had no family, save two sons,\r\none of whom died early, and the other, Charles Miller, at the age of 78,\r\nwho spent the greater part of his long life in India, and returned not\r\nuntil after his father's funeral; and over his grave, in the old\r\nchurch-yard of Chelsea, a stone and sculptured brass record his name and\r\nage and parentage, together with that of his aged and more distinguished\r\nsire. This stone, too, was placed by the above-mentioned public-spirited\r\nsocieties, (unto both which the writer has the honour to belong) at the\r\nsame time as the monument, stated by Faulkner, to the never-dying fame\r\nof the father.\r\n\r\n\"But it is even now scarcely known, that when those meritorious\r\ntestimonials of public gratitude were showered over the memory of Philip\r\nMiller, who had laboured so long and so successfully in the sciences\r\nwhich he loved, there was only one individual in existence, and that a\r\nvery aged person, who had seen and attended the funeral of Miller, and\r\nwho alone could point out the very spot where the 'Prince of\r\nHorticulture' was inhumed. This venerable person's name was Goodyer; he\r\nwas the parish clerk of Chelsea church for half a century, and died as\r\nsuch in 1818, at the great age of ninety-four.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, though last, it should not be concealed that I myself had\r\nactually stated and published, in the winter of 1794-5, the neglectful\r\nand opprobrious fact of Miller's having no single grave-stone, much less\r\na monument, nor even one funeral line, to designate the spot where\r\nrested in its 'narrow house' the mortal relics of so great a man; see my\r\nObservations on the Genus Mesembryanthemum, p. 311-14; and, as every\r\nreader may not possess that publication, the following extract from it\r\nis added:--\r\n\r\n\"'So much for Miller; he, alas! who pleased so well, or, rather let me\r\nsay, he who instructed and edified so much, and was even caressed by the\r\ngreat while living, now lies, forgotten by his friends, inhumed amongst\r\nthe common undistinguished dead, in the bleak cold yard of Chelsea\r\nchurch, the very theatre of his best actions, the physic gardens of the\r\nWorshipful Company of Apothecaries, at Chelsea, not half a mile distant,\r\nwithout a tomb! without a stone! nay, destitute of a single line to mark\r\nthe spot where rests, retired from all its cares and useful toils, the\r\ntime-worn frame of the 'Prince of Horticulture!' How are those\r\ndiscerning foreigners, who so meritoriously rendered the language of his\r\nDictionary into their own, to judge of this? by what measure are they to\r\nestimate the fact? Miller was the author of several publications,\r\nbesides the very numerous editions of his Dictionary and Kalendar.'\r\n\r\n   Yours, &c.\r\n\r\n   \"A. H. HAWORTH.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN HILL. His works are many of them enumerated in the Encyclo. of\r\nGardening. The most full list is in Weston's Catalogue. His portrait is\r\nengraved in metz by Houston, from after Coates. It is an oval, with a\r\n_solitaire_. A short account of his life and writings was published at\r\nEdinburgh in 1779. The most general account of him is in Hutchinson's\r\nBiog. Medica. 2 vols. 8vo. See also the Biog. Dramatica, 2nd edit.\r\n1782.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTY LANGLEY was born at Twickenham, where he resided. He was the\r\nauthor of,\r\n\r\n1. Practical Geometry, 1726.\r\n\r\n2.

On the first\r\nestablishment of the British Museum, he was most active in furnishing\r\nits garden, with no fewer than six hundred plants. His house (as Dr.\r\nPulteney observes) \"became the resort of the most ingenious and\r\nillustrious experimental philosophers that England could boast.\" Dr.\r\nPulteney has closed a very liberal memoir of him, by inserting Dr.\r\nGarthshore's testimony to the humane feeling, the social politeness, and\r\nbenignity of Sir William. His portrait is painted by Abbot, and engraved\r\nby Ryder, 1791. There is a full account of him in Chalmers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. WILLIAM HANBURY, the intimate friend of Churchill, and of\r\nLloyd, in his singular \"History of the Charitable Foundations at Church\r\nLangton,\" (and which exhibits his own benevolent heart, and great love\r\nfor planting and gardening) mentions, at page 185, a full-length\r\nportrait of himself, by Penny. Had there been any other portrait of him,\r\nit is likely Mr. Nicholls would have mentioned it in his Leicestershire,\r\nfor that gentleman, as well as Joseph Cradock, Esq. (both of whom are\r\nlately deceased), would have been most likely to have known, if any\r\nother portrait of this zealous planter did exist; so would Dr. Thomas\r\nWarton, who always spoke of Mr. Hanbury as a generous, disinterested,\r\nand benevolent man. Earlom engraved, in 1775, a three-quarter\r\nmetzotinto, from the above portrait by Penny. Mr. Hanbury also published\r\n\"A Complete Body of Planting and Gardening;\" 2 vols. folio. Also, \"An\r\nEssay on Planting, and a Scheme to make it conducive to the Glory of\r\nGod, and the Advantage of Society;\" Oxford, 8vo. 1s. 1758. And \"The\r\nGardener's New Calendar;\" 8vo. 1758.\r\n\r\nMr. Hanbury first conceived, in 1751, the establishing at Church\r\nLangton, for benevolent purposes, his immense plantations; having\r\nprocured (particularly from North America) \"almost every sort of seed\r\nthat could be procured.\" He proposed that an annual sermon should be\r\npreached, either in praise of church music, the duty of decorating\r\nreligious houses, charity in general, or the wonders of the creation;\r\nand that a hospital should be founded for the relief of the really\r\ndistressed. All these extensive plans were frustrated. Even when his\r\nfirst twenty thousand trees had just been planted out, the cattle\r\nbelonging to the tenants of Mrs. Dorothy Pickering, and Frances Byrd,\r\n(who a few years after died worth two hundred thousand pounds, and whose\r\nvillage biography is curiously dispersed throughout the above history)\r\nwere _purposely_ turned amongst the young trees, and in a little time\r\ndestroyed them all. \"Neither was this all; I was served for a trespass\r\nwith twenty-seven different copies of writs in one day (by their\r\nattorney, Valentine Price, of Leicester); to such a degree of rage and\r\nfury were these old gentlewomen raised, at what one should have thought\r\nevery heart would have rejoiced, and kindly lent an assisting hand.\" Mr.\r\nHanbury gives many instances of the \"venomous rage and passion\" of these\r\ntwo old women. They had, says he, \"the mortification to find themselves\r\ntotally despised. Not a gentleman or lady would go near them, two\r\nneighbouring clergymen excepted, who were invited to dine with them upon\r\nvenison.\" They attempted making a tool of the sow-gelder's son, to\r\nenable them to carry on their mean plans, and sent him word, that\r\nnothing they could do for him in the parish should be wanting. His\r\nanswer was, \"that favours granted from such people, on such terms, could\r\nnever prosper, and he desired the other to tell them, they were _two old\r\nbitches_.\"--\"This summer, (says Mr. Hanbury,) was murdered, in the most\r\nbarbarous manner, the best spaniel that perhaps ever entered the field,\r\nand the best greyhound that ever run. With these I had been often\r\nentertained in my morning walks. To deprive me of these pleasures,\r\nafforded me in my morning recreations, I had discharges from Mrs.\r\nPickering, and Mrs. Byrd, for taking them with me in their manors. To\r\nthese I paid no regard, and as they never brought any action on that\r\naccount, it may be supposed they could find no just cause to ground one.\r\nWhat then is to be done? Some method is to be contrived to deprive me of\r\nmy attendants; the spaniel therefore was the first object destined for\r\ndestruction. He was small, and of a beautiful black, and had been used\r\nto the parlour; and being absent about an hour, came reeling home in the\r\nagonies of death; and in about a quarter of an hour after, died in the\r\nseemingly most excruciating tortures. Suspecting some villany, I ordered\r\nhim to be opened, but found everything perfect and entire; I then\r\ndirected him to be skinned, and coming to the loins, found the traces of\r\na table-fork, which was stuck into the kidneys, and which was the\r\noccasion of his speedy and dreadful death. A few days after this, my\r\nbest greyhound was stuck in the loins, in the like barbarous manner,\r\nwhich brought on the same kind of speedy and agonizing death; and this\r\nwas the catastrophe of these two noted dogs, which had been much talked\r\nof, and were famous amongst sportsmen, as being most perfect in their\r\nkind. Some time after this, their game-keeper, in company with his\r\nnephew, _buried two dogs alive_; they were the property of Mr. Wade, a\r\nsubstantial grazier, who had grounds contiguous to a place of cover,\r\ncalled Langton Caudle, where was often game; and where the unfortunate\r\ntwo dogs, straying from their master, had been used to hunt. The\r\ngame-keeper and his nephew being shooting in this place, the dogs, upon\r\nthe report of the gun, made towards them. Their shooting them or hanging\r\nthem would have been merciful, but they buried them alive; and what\r\nwords can express the abhorrence of such barbarity to such innocent\r\ncreatures following the dictates of nature? To prevent a possibility of\r\ntheir scratching a way out, they covered them down with black thorns;\r\nover these they laid a sufficient quantity of earth and one large stone,\r\nwhich the rammed down with their heels. Day after day the dogs were\r\nheard in this place, with the howling, barking noise of dogs that were\r\nlost. Some people resorted to find them out, and wondered it was to no\r\npurpose, for nobody could suspect the dogs were under ground; and thus\r\nafter calling and whistling them, and seeking them for some time,\r\nreturned, amazed that lost dogs should continue so long in that place;\r\nbut a sight of none could ever be had. The noise was fancied to come\r\nsometimes from one quarter, sometimes from another; and when they came\r\nnear the place they were in, they ceased howling, expecting their\r\ndeliverance was at hand. I myself heard them _ten days_ after they had\r\nbeen buried; and seeing some people at a distance, enquired what dogs\r\nthey were. _They are some dogs that are lost, Sir_, said they; _they\r\nhave been lost some time_. I concluded only some poachers had been there\r\nearly in the morning, and by a precipitate flight had left their dogs\r\nbehind them. In short, the howling and barking of these dogs was heard\r\nfor near three weeks, when it ceased. Mr. Wade's dogs were missing, but\r\nhe could not suspect those to be his; and the noise ceasing, the\r\nthoughts, wonder, and talking about them, soon also ceased. Some time\r\nafter, a person being amongst the bushes where the howling was heard,\r\ndiscovered some disturbed earth, and the print of men's heels ramming it\r\ndown again very close; and seeing Mr. Wade's servant, told him, he\r\nthought something had been buried there. _Then_, said the man, _it is\r\nour dogs, and they have been buried alive: I will go and fetch a spade,\r\nand will find them, if I dig all Caudle over_. He soon brought a spade,\r\nand upon removing the top earth, came to the blackthorns, and then to\r\nthe dogs, the biggest of which had eat the loins and greatest share of\r\nthe hind parts of the little one.\" Mr. Hanbury states the deaths of\r\nthese two sisters in the course of a few months after. The sums they\r\naccumulated by their penurious way of living, were immense. They\r\nbequeathed legacies by will to almost every body that were no kin to\r\nthem except their assiduous attorney, Valentine Price, to whom they left\r\nnothing. \"But what is strange and wonderful, though their charities in\r\ntheir life-time at Langton were a sixpenny loaf a week only, which was\r\ndivided into as many parts as there were petitioners, and distributed by\r\neleven of the clock on a Sunday, unless they left the town the day\r\nbefore, which was often the case, and when the poor were sure to fail of\r\ntheir bounty; these gentlewomen, at the death of the last, bequeathed by\r\nwill upwards of twelve thousand pounds to the different hospitals and\r\nreligious institutions in the kingdom. A blaze of goodness issued from\r\nthem at last, and thus ended these two poor, unhappy, uncharitable,\r\ncharitable old gentlewomen.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Marshall calls him, \"the indefatigable Hanbury, whose immense\r\nlabours are in a manner lost to the public.\" No man delighted more than\r\nMr. Hanbury did, in describing the beauty of trees and shrubs: this is\r\nvisible in the extracts which Mr. Marshall has made in his \"Planting and\r\nRural Ornament.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM SHENSTONE, Esq., justly celebrated for his pure and classic\r\ntaste in landscape gardening. His tender and pathetic feelings shine\r\nthroughout most of his works; and the sweetness and simplicity of his\r\ntemper and manners, endeared him to the neighbourhood and to his\r\nacquaintance. Dr. Johnson says, his life was unstained by any crime. He\r\nfarther says of him, \"He began from this time to entangle his walks, and\r\nto wind his waters; which he did with such judgment and such fancy, as\r\nmade his little domain the envy of the great and the admiration of the\r\nskilful. His house was mean, and he did not improve it; his care was of\r\nhis grounds. When he came home from his walks, he might find his floor\r\nflooded by a shower through the broken roof; but could spare no money\r\nfor its reparation. In time his expences brought clamours about him,\r\nthat overpowered the lamb's bleat and the linnet's song; and his groves\r\nwere haunted by beings very different from fawns and fairies. He spent\r\nhis estate in adorning it, and his death was probably hastened by his\r\nanxieties. He was a lamp that spent its oil in blazing. It is said, that\r\nif he had lived a little longer he would have been assisted by a\r\npension: such bounty could not have been ever more properly bestowed;\r\nbut that it was ever asked is not certain; it is too certain that it\r\nnever was enjoyed.\"\r\n\r\nHis intimate friend, Robert Dodsley, thus speaks of him: \"Tenderness,\r\nindeed, in every sense of the word, was his peculiar characteristic; his\r\nfriends, his domestics, his poor neighbours, all daily experienced his\r\nbenevolent turn of mind. He was no economist; the generosity of his\r\ntemper prevented him from paying a proper regard to the use of money: he\r\nexceeded, therefore, the bounds of his paternal fortune, which before he\r\ndied was considerably incumbered. But when one recollects the perfect\r\nparadise he had raised around him, the hospitality with which he lived,\r\nhis great indulgence to his servants, his charities to the indigent, and\r\nall done with an estate not more than three hundred pounds a year, one\r\nshould rather be led to wonder that he left any thing behind him, than\r\nto blame his want of economy. He left, however, more than sufficient to\r\npay all his debts; and, by his will, appropriated his whole estate for\r\nthat purpose.\"\r\n\r\nHis portrait is prefixed to his works, published in 3 vols. 8vo. 1764.\r\nHis second volume contains his \"Unconnected Thoughts on Landscape\r\nGardening;\" and the description of the celebrated _Leasowes_, in that\r\nvolume, was written by (\"the modest, sensible, and humane\") Robert\r\nDodsley. His Epistolary Correspondence appeared in 2 vols. 8vo. The\r\ntitle pages of the above first three volumes are attractive from their\r\nvignette, or rural embellishments. A portrait of Shenstone was taken in\r\n1758, by Ross, which Hall engraved for Dodsley, in 1780; and this\r\npicture by Ross was in the possession of the late most worthy Dr.\r\nGraves, of Claverton, who died a few years ago, at the advanced age of\r\nninety. Bell's edition of the Poets has a neat copy of this portrait.\r\nDr. Graves wrote \"Recollections of the late William Shenstone.\" He also\r\ndedicated an urn to him, and inscribed these lines thereon:--\r\n\r\n   Stranger! if woods and lawns like these,\r\n   If rural scenes thy fancy please,\r\n   Ah! stop awhile, and pensive view\r\n   Poor Shenstone's urn: who oft, like you,\r\n   These woods and lawns well-pleased has rov'd,\r\n   And oft these rural scenes approv'd.\r\n   Like him, be thou fair virtue's friend,\r\n   And health and peace thy steps attend.\r\n\r\nMr. Shenstone died in 1763, and is buried in Hales Owen church yard. An\r\nurn is placed in the church to his memory, thus inscribed:--\r\n\r\n   Whoe'er thou art, with reverence tread\r\n   These sacred mansions of the dead.--\r\n   Not that the monumental bust\r\n   Or sumptuous tomb HERE guards the dust\r\n   Of rich or great: (Let wealth, rank, birth,\r\n   Sleep undistinguish'd in the earth;)\r\n   This simple urn records a name\r\n   That shines with more exalted fame.\r\n     Reader! if genius, taste refined,\r\n   A native elegance of mind;\r\n   If virtue, science, manly sense;\r\n   If wit, that never gave offence;\r\n   The clearest head, the tenderest heart,\r\n   In thy esteem e'er claim'd a part;\r\n   Ah! smite thy breast, and drop a tear,\r\n   For, know, THY Shenstone's dust lies here.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason thus speaks of Shenstone:\r\n\r\n                          ----\"Nor thou\r\n   Shalt pass without thy meed, thou son of peace,\r\n   Who knew'st perchance to harmonize thy shades\r\n   Still softer than thy song; yet was that song\r\n   Nor rude nor unharmonious, when attuned\r\n   To pastoral plaint, or tales of slighted love.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Whateley pays his memory the following tribute, previous to his\r\nmasterly survey of his far-famed and enchanting seat: \"An allusion to\r\nthe ideas of pastoral poetry evidently enters into the design of the\r\nLeasowes, where they appear so lovely as to endear the memory of their\r\nauthor, and justify the reputation of Mr. Shenstone, who inhabited, made\r\nand directed that celebrated place. It is a perfect picture of his mind,\r\nsimple, elegant, and amiable, and will always suggest a doubt whether\r\nthe spot inspired his verses, or whether, in the scenes which he formed,\r\nhe only realized the pastoral images which abound in his songs.\"[85]\r\nGeorge Mason, in many pages, pays high compliments to Shenstone's taste:\r\n\"Paine's Hill has every mark of creative genius, and Hagley of\r\ncorrectest fancy; but the most intimate _alliance with nature_ was\r\nformed by Shenstone.\" Mr. Marshall, in his \"Planting and Rural\r\nOrnament,\" has some critical remarks on the _Leasowes_, the expences in\r\nperfecting which threw Shenstone \"on the rack of poverty, and probably\r\nhastened the dissolution of an amiable and valuable man.\" He says that\r\n_Enville_ was originally designed by Shenstone, and that the cascade\r\nand chapel were spoken of, with confidence, as his.[86]\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD KAMES. His portrait is prefixed to the memoirs of him, by Lord\r\nWoodhouselee, in 2 vols. 4to. 1807. There is an edition of the same\r\nwork, in 3 vols. 8vo. 1814, with the same portrait, which is engraved\r\nfrom a drawing by D. Martin. His \"Gentleman Farmer\" spread his fame\r\nthrough Scotland. Its preface is particularly interesting. Mr. Smellie,\r\nin his Literary Lives of Gregory, Home, Hume, Adam Smith, and Lord\r\nKames, after giving many interesting particulars of the latter, and\r\nafter noticing his benevolence to the poor, during the whole course of\r\nhis long life, proceeds:--\"One great feature in the character of Lord\r\nKames, besides his literary talents, and his public spirit, was a\r\nremarkable innocency of mind. He not only never indulged in detraction,\r\nbut when any species of scandal was exhibited in his company, he either\r\nremained silent, or endeavoured to give a turn to the conversation. As\r\nnatural consequences of this amiable disposition, he never meddled with\r\npolitics, even when politics ran to indecent lengths in this country;\r\nand what is still more remarkable, he never wrote a sentence,\r\nnotwithstanding his numerous publications, without a direct and a\r\nmanifest intention to benefit his fellow creatures. In his temper he was\r\nnaturally warm, though kindly and affectionate. In the friendships he\r\nformed, he was ardent, zealous and sincere. So far from being inclined\r\nto irreligion, as some ignorant bigots insinuated, few men possessed a\r\nmore devout habit of thought. A constant sense of Deity, and a\r\nveneration for Providence, dwelt upon his mind. From this source arose\r\nthat propensity, which appears in all his writings, of investigating\r\nfinal causes, and tracing the wisdom of the Supreme Author of Nature.\"\r\nHe had the honour to be highly esteemed by the celebrated Mrs. Montagu.\r\n\r\nThe European Magazine of Nov. 1790, which gives an engraved portrait of\r\nhim, being a copy of the above, thus speaks: \"He was one of the very\r\nfirst who to great legal knowledge, added a considerable share of polite\r\nliterature. He arrived at the highest rank to which a lawyer could\r\nattain in his own country; and he has left to the world such literary\r\nproductions, as will authorize his friends to place him, if not in the\r\nhighest, yet much above the lowest, class of elegant and polite writers.\r\nHe died in 1783, leaving to the world a proof, that an attention to the\r\nabstrusest branches of learning, is not incompatible with the more\r\npleasing pursuits of taste and polite literature.\" He was kind-hearted\r\nand humane. His pure taste in landscape scenery, is acknowledged by Mr.\r\nLoudon, in p. 81 of the Encyclopaedia of Gardening. _Blair Drummond_ will\r\nlong be celebrated as having been his residence, and he there displayed\r\nhis superior taste in planting and improving.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Elements of Criticism,\" (a truly original work) there is a\r\ndistinct chapter on architecture and gardening. He therein thus\r\naddresses the reader:--\"These cursory observations upon gardening, shall\r\nbe closed with some reflections that must touch every reader. Rough\r\nuncultivated ground, dismal to the eye, inspires peevishness and\r\ndiscontent: may not this be one cause of the harsh manners of savages? A\r\nfield richly ornamented, containing beautiful objects of various kinds,\r\ndisplays in full lustre the goodness of the Deity, and the ample\r\nprovision he has made for our happiness. Ought not the spectator to be\r\nfilled with gratitude to his Maker, and with benevolence to his fellow\r\ncreatures? Other fine arts may be perverted to excite irregular and even\r\nvicious emotions; but gardening, which inspires the purest and most\r\nrefined pleasures, cannot fail to promote every good affection. The\r\ngaiety and harmony of mind it produceth, inclineth the spectator to\r\ncommunicate his satisfaction to others, and to make them happy as he is\r\nhimself, and tends naturally to establish in him a habit of humanity and\r\nbenevolence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ABERCROMBIE'S manly and expressive countenance is best given in the\r\nportrait prefixed to an edition in 2 vols. 8vo. published Feb. 1, 1783,\r\nby Fielding and Debrett. He is also drawn at full-length at his age of\r\nseventy-two, in the sixteenth edition, printed in 1800, with a pleasing\r\nview of a garden in the back-ground, neatly engraved. This honest,\r\nunassuming man, persevered \"through a long life of scarcely interrupted\r\nhealth,\" in the ardent pursuit of his favourite science. The tenor of\r\nhis life exemplified how much a garden calms the mind, and tranquilly\r\nsets at rest its turbulent passions. Mr. Loudon's Encyclop. of\r\nGardening, after giving some interesting points of his history, thus\r\nconcludes: \"In the spring of 1806, being in his eightieth year, he met\r\nwith a severe fall, by which he broke the upper part of his thigh bone.\r\nThis accident, which happened to him on the 15th of April, terminated in\r\nhis death. After lying in a very weak exhausted state, without much\r\npain, he expired in the night, between April and May, as St. Paul's\r\nchurch struck twelve. He was lamented by all who knew him, as cheerful,\r\nharmless, and upright.\" One of his biographers thus relates of him:\r\n\"Abercrombie from a fall down stairs in the dark, died at the age of\r\neighty, and was buried at St. Pancras. He was present at the famous\r\nbattle of Preston Pans, which was fought close to his father's garden\r\nwalls. For the last twenty years of his life he lived chiefly on tea,\r\nusing it three times a-day: his pipe was his first companion in the\r\nmorning, and last at night.[87] He never remembered to have taken a dose\r\nof physic in his life, prior to his last fatal accident, nor of having a\r\nday's illness but once.\" A list of his works appears in Watts's Bibl.\r\nBrit., and a most full one in Johnson's History of English Gardening,\r\nwho, with many collected particulars of Abercrombie, relates the great\r\nand continually increasing sale of some of his works.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAUNCELOT BROWNE, Esq.\r\nHis portrait was painted by Dance, and engraved by Sherwin. Under this\r\nportrait are engraved the following lines, from the pen of Mr. Mason,\r\nwhich are also inscribed on the tomb of Mr. Browne, in the church of\r\nFen-Staunton, Huntingdonshire:\r\n\r\n   _Ye sons of elegance, who truly taste\r\n     The simple charms which genuine art supplies,\r\n   Come from the sylvan scenes his genius drew,\r\n     And offer here your tributary sighs.\r\n   But know, that more than genius slumbers here,\r\n     Virtues were his that art's best powers transcend,\r\n   Come, ye superior train! who these revere,\r\n     And weep the christian, husband, father, friend._\r\n\r\nMr. Walpole, too, pays Mr. Browne this elegant compliment: \"Did living\r\nartists come within my plan, I should be glad to do justice to Mr.\r\nBrowne; but he may be a gainer by being reserved for some abler pen.\"\r\nThis celebrated landscape gardener died suddenly, in Hertford Street,\r\nMay Fair, on the 6th of February, 1783, on his return from a visit to\r\nhis old friend the Earl of Coventry. Mr. Browne, though bred a common\r\ngardener at Stowe, possessed a cultivated mind, and his society was much\r\ncourted. Joseph Cradock, Esq. called him \"a most agreeable, unassuming\r\nman.\" He amassed a large fortune. He was consulted by most of the\r\nnobility and gentry, and the places he laid out or altered, were, as Mr.\r\nLoudon observes, beyond all reckoning. Mr. Repton has given a list of\r\nhis principal works.\r\n\r\nIt has been the fate of this eminent master of landscape embellishment,\r\nto be severely censured by some, and lavishly praised by others. The\r\nlate keen and consummate observer of landscape scenery, Sir Uvedale\r\nPrice, harshly condemns the too frequent cold monotony and tameness of\r\nmany of Mr. Browne's creations, and his never transfusing into his works\r\nany thing of the taste and spirit which prevail in the poet Mason's\r\nprecepts and descriptions; and in one of his acute, yet pleasant pages,\r\nhe alludes to his having but _one_ and the same plan of operation;\r\n_Sangrado_-like, treating all disorders in the same manner. Perhaps the\r\ntoo general smoothness and tameness of Mr. Browne's pleasure-grounds ill\r\naccorded with Sir Uvedale's enthusiasm for the more sublime views of\r\nforest scenery, rapid and stony torrents and cascades, wild entangled\r\ndingles, and craggy breaks; or with the high and sublime notions he had\r\nimbibed from the rich scenery of nature so often contemplated by him in\r\nthe landscapes of _Claude_, or in those of _Rubens_, _Gaspar Poussin_,\r\n_Salvator Rosa_, or of _Titian_, \"the greatest of all landscape\r\npainters.\" Perhaps Sir Uvedale preferred \"unwedgeable and gnarled oaks,\"\r\nto \"the tameness of the poor pinioned trees of a gentleman's plantation,\r\ndrawn up straight,\" or the wooded banks of a river, to the \"bare shaven\r\nborder of a canal.\"[88]\r\n\r\nDaines Barrington happily said, \"Kent has been succeeded by Browne, who\r\nhath undoubtedly great merit in laying out pleasure-grounds; but I\r\nconceive that in some of his plans, I see rather traces of the\r\nkitchen-gardener of old Stowe, than of Poussin or Claude Lorraine: I\r\ncould wish, therefore, that Gainsborough gave the design, and that\r\nBrowne executed it.\"[89] Mr. Loudon observes, \"that Browne must have\r\npossessed considerable talents, the extent of his reputation abundantly\r\nproves; but that he was imbued with much of that taste for picturesque\r\nbeauty, which distinguished the works of Kent, Hamilton, and Shenstone,\r\nwe think will hardly be asserted by any one who has observed attentively\r\nsuch places as are known to be his creations.\" Mr. George Mason candidly\r\nasks, \"why Browne should be charged with all the defects of those that\r\nhave called themselves his followers, I have seen no good reason\r\nalleged, nor can I suppose it possible to produce one.\" Many of his\r\nimitators exhibited so little talent in their creations, that Mr.\r\nBrowne's name considerably suffered in the estimation of many.\r\n\r\nMr. Gilpin speaks of Browne's improvements at Blenheim in high terms.\r\nMr. Marshall in his Survey of Stowe and Fisherwick, in vol. i. of his\r\n\"Planting and Rural Ornament,\" and at p. 384, pays a fair tribute to\r\nhim. Much general information respecting him may be seen in Mr. Loudon's\r\nchapter \"Of the rise, progress, and present state of gardening in the\r\nBritish Isles.\" The candour and rich conciseness of this review,\r\nembraces the whole _magic of the art_, as respects landscape\r\ngardening.[90]\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS ZAVIER VISPRE wrote \"A Dissertation on the Growth of Wine in\r\nEngland\", Bath, 8vo. 1786. Mr. Vispre died poor, between thirty and\r\nforty years ago, in St. Martin's Lane. He excelled in painting portraits\r\nin crayons: Sir Joshua much esteemed him. He was a most inoffensive man,\r\nof the mildest manners, and of the purest integrity. I have seen his\r\nportrait in crayons, in an oval, finely finished by himself, but know\r\nnot now where that is. On his mode of training the vine _very near the\r\nground_, see p. 757 of the Encyclop. of Gardening.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM MASON, precentor and canon of York, died in 1797. His friend,\r\nSir Joshua Reynolds, painted an impressive portrait of him, which is\r\nengraved by Doughty. A masterly copy of this fine portrait is in Mr.\r\nCadell's Contemporary Portraits. A copy is also prefixed to the edition\r\nof his works, in 4 vols. 8vo. 1811, published by Mr. Cadell. His\r\nportrait was also taken by Vaslet, and engraved by Carter, 1771. It is a\r\nlarge metz etching. He translated Du Fresnoy's Art of Painting, to which\r\nSir Joshua added some notes. Mr. Mason has prefixed an Epistle to Sir\r\nJoshua, which thus concludes:\r\n\r\n   And oh! if ought thy poet can pretend\r\n   Beyond his favourite wish, to _call thee friend_:\r\n   Be it that here his tuneful toil has dress'd\r\n   The muse of _Fresnoy_ in a modern vest;\r\n   And, with what skill his fancy could bestow,\r\n   Taught the close folds to take an easier flow;\r\n   Be it that here, thy partial smile approv'd\r\n   The pains he lavish'd on the art he lov'd.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason's attachment to painting was an early one, is conspicuous in\r\nmany of his writings, and in his English Garden, is visible throughout:\r\n\r\n                                ----feel ye there\r\n   What _Reynolds_ felt, when first the Vatican\r\n   Unbarr'd her gates, and to his raptur'd eye\r\n   Gave all the god-like energy that flow'd\r\n   From _Michael's_ pencil; feel what _Garrick_ felt,\r\n   When first he breath'd the soul of _Shakspeare's_ page.\r\n\r\nSir Joshua, in his will, bequeaths his then supposed portrait of Milton\r\nto Mr. Mason.\r\n\r\nMr. Gray thus observes of Mason, when at Cambridge:--\"So ignorant of the\r\nworld and its ways, that this does not hurt him in one's opinion; so\r\nsincere and so undisguised, that no mind with a spark of generosity\r\nwould ever think of hurting him, he lies so open to injury; but so\r\nindolent, that if he cannot overcome this habit, all his good qualities\r\nwill signify nothing at all.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mason, in 1754, found a patron in the Earl of Holderness, who\r\npresented him with the living of _Aston_, in Yorkshire. This sequestred\r\nvillage was favourable to his love of poetry and picturesque scenery;\r\nwhich displayed itself at large in his English Garden, and was the\r\nfoundation of his lasting friendship with Mr. Gilpin, who to testify his\r\nesteem, dedicated to him his _Observations on the Wye_. A biographer of\r\nthe late Mr. Shore, of Norton Hall, (the friend of Priestley), thus\r\nmentions _Aston_:--\"That truly conscientious, and truly learned and\r\nexcellent man, Mr. Lindsey, spent a whole week in this neighbourhood. He\r\nwas during that time the guest of his friend Mr. Mason, who was residing\r\non his rectory at _Aston_, the biographer of Gray, and one whose taste,\r\ngave beauty, and poetry, celebrity, to that cheerful village.\" His\r\nfriendship for Mr. Gray, terminated only with the life of the latter. In\r\n1770 Mr. Mason was visited at Aston, for the last time, by him. His last\r\nletter to Mr. Mason was from Pembroke-hall, in May, 1771, and on the\r\n31st of the next month, and at that place, this sublime genius paid the\r\ndebt of nature. The following epitaph was written by Mr. Mason, and\r\ninscribed on the monument in Westminster Abbey:\r\n\r\n   No more the Grecian muse unrivall'd reigns;\r\n     To Britain let the nations homage pay:\r\n   She felt a Homer's fire in Milton's strains,\r\n     A Pindar's rapture in the lyre of Gray.\r\n\r\nHe farther evinced his attachment to this elegant scholar by publishing\r\nhis poems and letters, to which he prefixed memoirs of him. He commences\r\nthe third book of his English Garden with an invocation to his memory,\r\nand records, in lofty language, his eye glistening and his accents\r\nglowing, when viewing the charms of all-majestic Nature--the heights of\r\nSkiddaw and the purple crags of Borrowdale. And on a rustic alcove, in\r\nthe garden at Aston, which he dedicated to Mr. Gray, he inscribed this\r\nstanza from the celebrated elegy:\r\n\r\n   _Here scatter'd oft, the loveliest of the year,\r\n     By hands unseen, are showers of violets found;\r\n   The red-breast loves to build and warble here,\r\n     And little footsteps lightly print the ground._\r\n\r\nMr. Mason married in 1765 a most amiable woman; she fell at length into\r\na rapid consumption, and at Bristol hot-wells she died. Gray's letter to\r\nMr. Mason while at that place, is full of eloquence; upon which the\r\nlatter observes, \"I opened it almost at the precise moment when it would\r\nbe necessarily most affecting. His epitaph on the monument he erected on\r\nthis lady, in the Bristol cathedral, breathes such tender feeling and\r\nchaste simplicity, that it can need no apology for being noticed here:\r\n\r\n   Take, holy earth! all that my soul holds dear;\r\n     Take that best gift which heav'n so lately gave:\r\n   To Bristol's fount I bore with trembling care\r\n     Her faded form: she bow'd to taste the wave\r\n   And died. Does youth, does beauty, read the line?\r\n     Does sympathetic fears their breasts alarm?\r\n   Speak, dead Maria! breathe a strain divine:\r\n     E'en from the grave thou shalt have power to charm.\r\n   Bid them be chaste, be innocent, like thee;\r\n     Bid them in duty's sphere as meekly move;\r\n   And if so fair, from vanity as free;\r\n     As firm in friendship, and as fond in love.\r\n   Tell them, though 'tis an awful thing to die,\r\n     ('Twas e'en to thee) yet the dread path once trod,\r\n   Heav'n lifts its everlasting portals high,\r\n     And bids \"the pure in heart behold their God.\"\r\n\r\nA very short time after Mrs. Mason's death, he began his English\r\nGarden, and invokes the genius both of poetry and painting\r\n\r\n                         ----that at my birth\r\n   Auspicious smil'd, and o'er my cradle dropp'd\r\n   Those magic seeds of Fancy, which produce\r\n   A Poet's feeling, and a Painter's eye.\r\n   ----with lenient smiles to deign to cheer,\r\n   At this sad hour, my desolated soul.\r\n   For deem not ye that I resume the lyre\r\n   To court the world's applause; my years mature\r\n   Have learn'd to slight the toy. No, 'tis to soothe\r\n   That agony of heart, which they alone,\r\n   Who best have lov'd, who best have been belov'd,\r\n   Can feel, or pity: sympathy severe!\r\n   Which she too felt, when on her pallid lip\r\n   The last farewell hung trembling, and bespoke\r\n   A wish to linger here, and bless the arms\r\n   She left for heav'n.--She died, and heav'n is her's!\r\n   Be mine, the pensive solitary balm\r\n   That recollection yields. Yes, angel pure!\r\n   While memory holds her seat, thine image still\r\n   Shall reign, shall triumph there; and when, as now,\r\n   Imagination forms a nymph divine,\r\n   To lead the fluent strain, thy modest blush,\r\n   Thy mild demeanour, thy unpractis'd smile,\r\n   Shall grace that nymph, and sweet Simplicity\r\n   Be dress'd (ah, meek Maria!) in thy charms.\r\n\r\nDr. Thomas Warton thus speaks of the above poem, when reviewing Tusser's\r\nHusbandry:--\"Such were the rude beginnings in the English language of\r\ndidactic poetry, which, on a kindred subject, the present age has seen\r\nbrought to perfection, by the happy combination of judicious precepts,\r\nwith the most elegant ornaments of language and imagery, in Mr. Mason's\r\nEnglish Garden.\" His Elfrida and Caractacus, are admired for boldness of\r\nconception and sublime description. Elfrida was set to Music by Arne,\r\nand again by Giardini. Caractacus was also set to music. Mr. Mason's\r\nsuccess with both these dramatic poems was beyond his most sanguine\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\nDr. Darwin wrote an epitaph on Mr. Mason; these lines are its concluding\r\npart:\r\n\r\n   Weave the bright wreath, to worth departed just,\r\n   And hang unfading chaplets on his bust;\r\n   While pale Elfrida, bending o'er his bier,\r\n   Breathes the soft sigh and sheds the graceful tear;\r\n   And stern Caractacus, with brow depress'd\r\n   Clasps the cold marble to his mailed breast.\r\n   In lucid troops shall choral virgins throng,\r\n   With voice alternate chant their poet's song.\r\n   And, oh! in golden characters record\r\n   Each firm, immutable, immortal word!\r\n\r\n\"Those last two lines from the final chorus of Elfrida, (says Miss\r\nSeward), admirably close this tribute to the memory of him who stands\r\nsecond to Gray, as a lyric poet; whose English Garden is one of the\r\nhappiest efforts of didactic verse, containing the purest elements of\r\nhorticultural taste, dignified by freedom and virtue, rendered\r\ninteresting by episode, and given in those energetic and undulating\r\nmeasures which render blank verse excellent; whose unowned satires, yet\r\ncertainly his, the heroic epistle to Sir William Chambers, and its\r\npostscript, are at once original in their style, harmonious in their\r\nnumbers, and pointed in their ridicule; whose tragedies are the only\r\npathetic tragedies which have been written in our language upon the\r\nsevere Greek model. The Samson Agonistes bears marks of a stronger, but\r\nalso of an heavier hand, and is unquestionably less touching than the\r\nsweet Elfrida, and the sublime Caractacus.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mason, in 1756 published four Odes. \"It would be difficult to say,\r\n(says the biographer of the annual Necrology of 1797,) which is most to\r\nbe admired, the vividness of the conception, or the spirit of liberty,\r\nand the ardent love of independance throughout. The address to Milton in\r\nhis Ode to Memory, and to Andrew Marvel, in that to Independance, cannot\r\nbe too much admired. At the period when the Middlesex election was so\r\nmuch agitated, he united with those independant freeholders, who, by\r\ntheir declarations and petitions, throughout the nation, opposed\r\ncorruption, and claimed a reform in parliament; and when the county of\r\nYork assembled in 1779, he was of the committee, and had a great share\r\nin drawing up their spirited resolutions. The animated vindication of\r\nthe conduct of the freeholders, and other papers, though printed\r\nanonimously in the newspapers, and so printed in Mr. Wyvill's collection\r\nof political tracts, in 3 vols. are well known to be Mr. Mason's\r\nproduction. This conduct rendered him obnoxious to the court party. He\r\nwas at this time one of the king's chaplains, but when it became his\r\nturn to preach before the royal family, the queen appointed another\r\nperson to supply his place. It has been observed, that his sentiments in\r\na later period of his life, took a colour less favourable to liberty.\r\nWhether alarmed at the march of the French revolution, or from the\r\ntimidity of age, we know not. His friend Horace Walpole, charges him\r\nwith flat apostacy:\" The _Heroic Epistle_ to Sir W. Chambers, and the\r\n_Heroic Postscript_, are now positively said to have been written by Mr.\r\nMason. Mr. Thomas Warton observed, \"they may have been written by\r\nWalpole, and buckramed by Mason.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Sir U. Price, in the generous and patriotic conclusion of his\r\nletter to Mr. Repton, pays a delicate compliment to the genius of Mr.\r\nMason in whatever concerns rural scenery; and his respect for Mr. Mason,\r\nand his high opinion of his talents, is farther shewn in pp. 295 and\r\n371 of his first volume, and in p. 94 of vol. ii. Mr. Mathias, after\r\nsupposing Mr. Mason to have been the author of the Heroic Epistle, and\r\nafter paying a high compliment to his general poetry, thus concludes his\r\ngenerous tribute:\r\n\r\n   Whence is that groan? no more Britannia sleeps,\r\n   But o'er her lov'd Musaeus bends and weeps.\r\n   Lo, every Grecian, every British muse\r\n   Scatter the recent flowers and gracious dews\r\n   Where MASON lies!\r\n   And in his breast each soft affection dwelt,\r\n   That love and friendship know; each sister art,\r\n   With all that colours, and that sounds impart,\r\n   All that the sylvan theatre can grace,\r\n   All in the soul of MASON found their place!\r\n   Low sinks the laurell'd head: in Mona's land\r\n   I see them pass, 'tis Mador's drooping band,\r\n   To harps of woe, in holiest obsequies,\r\n   In yonder grave, they chant, our Druid lies!\r\n\r\nERASMUS DARWIN. In the life of this justly celebrated physician, by Miss\r\nSeward, she informs us, that in the year 1770, he sat to Mr. Wright of\r\nDerby; and that it was \"a contemplative portrait, of the most perfect\r\nresemblance.\" Whether it has been engraved I know not. He was then in\r\nhis thirty-eighth year. Dr. Thornton, in his superb work on botany, has\r\ngiven a fine portrait of Dr. Darwin, at a more advanced period of his\r\nlife. It breathes intelligence in every feature, and is a masterly\r\nlikeness. The late Mr. Archdeacon Clive preserved a highly-finished\r\nminiature portrait of him, which was ordered by Dr. Darwin for the\r\nexpress purpose of being presented to this worthy clergyman, whom he so\r\nmuch esteemed.[91]\r\n\r\nDr. Darwin published,\r\n\r\n1. Zoonomia, or the Laws of Organic Life.\r\n\r\n2. Phytologia, or the Philosophy of Agriculture and Gardening, 4to.\r\n1800. \"A vast field of treasured observation and scientific literature.\"\r\n\r\n3. The Botanic Garden.\r\n\r\nLord Byron, and others, have been severe on this poem. The lines,\r\nhowever, on the soldier's wife and infants, after watching the battle of\r\nMinden--those animated ones to Mr. Howard--or when the mother, during\r\nthe plague in London, commits her children to the grave,\r\n\r\n   _When o'er the friendless bier no rites were read,\r\n   No dirge slow chanted, and no pall outspread;_\r\n\r\nthese make one gladly acknowledge, that pathetic powers were the gift of\r\nDarwin's muse. The sublimity of the following address to our _first_\r\ndaring aeronaut, merits insertion:\r\n\r\n   --Rise, great Mongolfier! urge thy venturous flight\r\n   High o'er the moon's pale, ice-reflected light;\r\n   High o'er the pearly star, whose beamy horn\r\n   Hangs in the east, gay harbinger of morn;\r\n   Leave the red eye of Mars on rapid wing,\r\n   Jove's silver guards, and Saturn's dusky ring;\r\n   Leave the fair beams, which issuing from afar\r\n   Play with new lustres round the Georgian star;\r\n   Shun with strong oars the sun's attractive throne,\r\n   The burning Zodiac, and the milky Zone:\r\n   Where headlong comets with increasing force\r\n   Through other systems bend their burning course!\r\n   For thee Cassiope her chair withdraws,\r\n   For thee the Bear retracts his shaggy paws;\r\n   High o'er the north thy golden orb shall roll,\r\n   And blaze eternal round the wondering pole.[92]\r\n\r\nMiss Seward, after stating that professional generosity distinguished\r\nDr. Darwin's medical practice at Lichfield, farther says, that\r\n\"diligently also did he attend to the health of the poor in that city,\r\nand afterwards at Derby, and supplied their necessities by food, and all\r\nsorts of charitable assistance. In each of those towns, _his_ was the\r\ncheerful board of almost open-housed hospitality, without extravagance\r\nor pride; deeming ever the first unjust, the latter unmanly. Generosity,\r\nwit and science, were his household gods.\"[93] She again states that\r\nwhen he removed from Lichfield to Derby, \"his renown, as a physician,\r\nstill increased as time rolled on, and his mortal life declined from its\r\nnoon. Patients resorted to him more and more, from every part of the\r\nkingdom, and often from the continent. All ranks, all orders of society,\r\nall religions, leaned upon his power to ameliorate disease, and to\r\nprolong existence. The rigid and sternly pious, who had attempted to\r\nrenounce his aid, from a superstition that no blessing would attend the\r\nprescriptions of a sceptic, sacrificed, after a time, their\r\nsuperstitious scruples to their involuntary consciousness of his mighty\r\nskill.\" Mr. Mathias, though he severely criticizes some of Dr. Darwin's\r\nworks, yet he justly calls him \"this very ingenious man, and most\r\nexcellent physician, for such he undoubtedly was.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFrom scattered passages in Miss Seward's Life of him, one can easily\r\ntrace the delight he took (notwithstanding his immense professional\r\nengagements,) in the scenery of nature and gardens;--witness his\r\nfrequent admiration of the tangled glen and luxuriant landscape at\r\n_Belmont_, its sombre and pathless woods, impressing us with a sense of\r\nsolemn seclusion, like the solitudes of _Tinian_, or _Juan Fernandes_,\r\nwith its \"silent and unsullied stream,\" which the admirable lines he\r\naddresses to the youthful owner of that spot so purely and temperately\r\nallude to:--\r\n\r\n   O, friend to peace and virtue, ever flows\r\n   For thee my silent and unsullied stream,\r\n   Pure and untainted as thy blameless life!\r\n   Let no gay converse lead thy steps astray,\r\n   To mix my chaste wave with immodest wine,\r\n   Nor with the poisonous cup, which Chemia's hand\r\n   Deals (fell enchantress!) to the sons of folly!\r\n   So shall young Health thy daily walks attend,\r\n   Weave for thy hoary brow the vernal flower\r\n   Of cheerfulness, and with his nervous arm\r\n   Arrest th' inexorable scythe of Time.\r\n\r\nSo early, and indeed throughout his whole life, did Dr. Darwin enforce\r\nthe happy consequences of temperance and sobriety; from his conviction\r\nof the pernicious effects of all kinds of intemperance on the youthful\r\nconstitution. He had an absolute horror of spirits of all sorts, however\r\ndiluted. Pure water was, throughout the greater part of his temperate\r\nlife, his favourite beverage. He has been severely censured (no doubt\r\nvery justly so), for some of his religious prejudices. Old Walter Mapes,\r\nthe jovial canon of Salisbury, precentor of Lincoln, and arch-deacon of\r\nOxford, in the eleventh century, considered _water_ as fit only for\r\n_heretics_.\r\n\r\nOne may again trace his fondness for the rich scenery of nature, when he\r\nin 1777 purchased a wild umbrageous valley near Lichfield, with its\r\nmossy fountain of the purest water. This spot he fondly cultivated. The\r\nbotanic skill displayed by him on this spot, did not escape the\r\nsearching eye of Mr. Loudon, for in p. 807 of his Encyclop. of\r\nGardening, he pays a deserved compliment to him.[94] Miss Seward wrote\r\nsome lines on this favoured valley, and these are part of them:\r\n\r\n   O! may no ruder step these bowers profane,\r\n   No midnight wassailers deface the plain;\r\n   And when the tempests of the wintry day\r\n   Blow golden autumn's varied leaves away,\r\n   Winds of the north, restrain your icy gales,\r\n   Nor chill the bosom of these hallow'd vales.\r\n\r\nHis attachment to gardens, induced him to honour the memory of Mr.\r\nMason, by lines once intended for his monument; and he was suggesting\r\nimprovements at the priory at Derby (and which he had just described the\r\nlast morning of his life in a sprightly letter to a friend), when the\r\nfatal signal was given, and a few hours after, on the 18th of April,\r\n1802, and in his sixty-ninth year, he sunk into his chair and expired.\r\n\"Thus in one hour (says his affectionate biographer) was extinguished\r\nthat vital light, which the preceding hour had shone in flattering\r\nbrightness, promising duration; (such is often _the cunning flattery of\r\nnature_), that light, which through half a century, had diffused its\r\nradiance and its warmth so widely; that light in which penury had been\r\ncheered, in which science had expanded; to whose orb poetry had brought\r\nall her images; before whose influence disease had continually\r\nretreated, and death so often \"turned aside his levelled dart!\"[95] That\r\nDr. Darwin, as to his religious principles or prejudices, displayed\r\ngreat errors of judgment in his _Zoonomia_, there can be no doubt. An\r\neminent champion of Christianity, truly observed, that Dr. Darwin \"was\r\nacquainted with more links in the chain of _second_ causes, than had\r\nprobably been known to any individual, who went before him; but that he\r\ndwelt so much, and so _exclusively_ on second causes, that he too\r\ngenerally seems to have forgotten that there is a first.\" For these\r\nerrors he must long since have been called to his account, before one\r\nwho can appreciate those errors better than we can. Though the _Accusing\r\nSpirit_ must have blushed when he gave them in, yet, let us hope, that\r\nthe _Recording Angel_, out of mercy to his humane heart, and his many\r\ngood and valuable qualities, may have blotted them out for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\nREV. WILLIAM GILPIN, who, as Mr. Dallaway, in his Observations on the\r\nArts, observes, \"possesses unquestionably the happy faculty to paint\r\nwith words;\" and who farther highly compliments him in his supplementary\r\nchapter on Modern Gardening, annexed to his enriched edition of Mr.\r\nWalpole's Anecdotes. The Topographer says he \"describes with the\r\nlanguage of a master, the artless scenes of uncultivated nature.\" Mr.\r\nWalpole in his postscript to his Catalogue of Engravers, after\r\npremising, that it might, perhaps, be worth while \"to melt down this\r\nvolume and new cast it,\" pays this tribute to him: \"Were I of authority\r\nsufficient to name my successor, or could prevail on him to condescend\r\nto accept an office which he could execute with more taste and ability;\r\nfrom whose hands could the public receive so much information and\r\npleasure as from the author of the _Essay on Prints_, and from the\r\n_Tours_, &c.? And when was the public ever instructed by the pen and\r\npencil at once, with equal excellence in the style of both, but by Mr.\r\nGilpin?\"\r\n\r\nHad Mr. Gilpin written nothing more than his \"Lectures on the\r\nCatechism,\" that alone would have conferred on him the name of a\r\nmeritorious writer. His allusion to Plato, his reflections on the Last\r\nJudgment, his animated address to youth, and his conclusion of his\r\nsixteenth lecture, must strike deep into the heart of every reader. His\r\n\"Sermons preached to a Country Congregation,\" prove him a pious,\r\ncharitable, and valuable man.[96]\r\n\r\nThe glowing imagery of his style, when viewing the beautiful scenery in\r\nmany parts of England, and some of the vast and magnificent ones of\r\nScotland, is fraught with many fervid charms. Still we are forced to\r\njoin Mr. Mathias, in the remonstrance he so justly makes as to the\r\njargonic conceit of some of his language. Mr. Gilpin's first work on\r\npicturesque beauty, was his Observations on the River Wye, made in the\r\nyear 1770. He afterwards published:\r\n\r\nForest Scenery--Picturesque Beauties of the Highlands--Mountains of\r\nCumberland and Westmoreland--Western parts of England--Cambridge,\r\nNorfolk, Suffolk and Essex--Hampshire, Sussex and Kent. Three Essays, on\r\nPicturesque Beauty, on Picturesque Travel, and on Sketching Landscape,\r\nto which is added, a poem on Landscape Painting. A full account of his\r\nnumerous works may be seen in Watts's Bibl. Brit. A complete list of\r\nthem is also given by Mr. Nichols, in vol. i. of his Illustrations, with\r\na brief memoir. Mr. Johnson also gives a list of such of his works as\r\nrelate to picturesque scenery, with their titles at large. His portrait\r\nwas painted by Walton, and engraved in metz by Clint.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES ANDERSON published the following works; and I have given the price\r\nof such of them as appeared in the late Mr. Harding's Agricultural\r\nCatalogue:--\r\n\r\n     1. The Bee, or Literary Intelligencer, 18 vols. 8vo. _Edinb._ 1791.\r\n\r\n     2. Recreations in Agriculture, Natural History, Arts and\r\n     Miscellaneous Literature, 6 vols. 8vo. _Lond._ 3_l._ 10s.\r\n\r\n     3. Essays relating to Agriculture and Rural Affairs, 3 vols. 8vo.\r\n     1_l._ 7s.\r\n\r\n     4. Practical Treatise on draining Bogs, 8vo. 6s.\r\n\r\n     5. Practical Treatise on Peat Moss, 8vo. 5s.\r\n\r\n     6. On Lime as a Cement and Manure, 8vo. 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n     7. An Account of the different kinds of Sheep found in the Russian\r\n     Dominions, and amongst the Tartar Hordes, 8vo. 6s.\r\n\r\n     8. Investigation of the Causes of Scarcity of 1800. 8vo. 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\n     9. Miscellaneous Thoughts on Planting Timber Trees, chiefly for the\r\n     climate of Scotland, by Agricola, 8vo. _Edinb._ 1777.\r\n\r\n     10. Description of a Patent Hot-house, 1804. 12mo. 5s.\r\n\r\nIn \"Public Characters of 1800 and 1801,\" a portrait is given of him, a\r\nlist of his works, and it thus speaks of him: \"The manners of this\r\ningenious and very useful man were plain and frank, an indication of an\r\nhonest and good heart. He was benevolent and generous, a tender parent,\r\nand a warm friend, and very highly respected in the circle of his\r\nacquaintance.\" There is a portrait of him, painted by Anderson, and\r\nengraved by Ridley. A copy is given in the Mirror, (published by Vernon\r\nand Hood), of Nov. 1799. Another is given in the Gentleman's Magazine.\r\nHe died at West Ham, Essex, in 1808, aged 69. Mr. Lysons, in the\r\nSupplement to his Environs of London, gives a few particulars of him.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORACE WALPOLE. He was the youngest son of Sir Robert Walpole, who so\r\nlong guided the destinies of England, and whose attractive and\r\nbenevolent private life, seems to have fully merited the praise of\r\nPope's elegant muse:\r\n\r\n   _Seen him I have; but in his happier hour\r\n   Of social pleasure,--ill exchang'd for power--\r\n   Seen him uncumber'd with the venal tribe,\r\n   Smile without art, and win without a bribe._\r\n\r\nThe best portraits of this intelligent and acute writer, Horace Walpole,\r\nare the portrait in Mr. Dallaway's richly decorated edition of the\r\nAnecdotes of Painting, from Sir Joshua Reynolds, and that in Mr.\r\nCadell's Contemporary Portraits, from Lawrence. Dance also drew him.\r\nAnother portrait is prefixed to the ninth volume of his works, in 4to.\r\n1825, from a picture in the possession of the Marquis of Hertford. There\r\nis another portrait, engraved by Pariset, from Falconot. Mr. Walpole\r\ndied in March, 1797, at his favourite seat at Strawberry-hill, at the\r\nage of eighty. His manners were highly polished, from his having, during\r\nthe course of a long life, frequented the first societies. His\r\nconversation abounded with interesting anecdote and playful wit.\r\nFelicity of narration, and liveliness of expression, mark his graceful\r\npen. The Prince de Ligne (a perfect judge) thus speaks of his _History\r\nof the Modern Taste in Gardening_:--\"Je n'en admire pas moins\r\nl'eloquence, et la profondeur, de son ouvrage sur les jardins.\" Mr.\r\nWalpole himself says:--\"We have given the true model of gardening to the\r\nworld: let other countries mimic or corrupt our taste; but let it reign\r\nhere on its verdant throne, original by its elegant simplicity, and\r\nproud of no other art than that of softening nature's harshnesses, and\r\ncopying her graceful touch.\"\r\n\r\nSir U. Price, in vol. i. p. 18 of his Essays, pays high respect to Mr.\r\nWalpole, and differs from him \"with great deference and reluctance.\" He\r\nobserves:--\"I can hardly think it necessary to make any excuse for\r\ncalling Lord Orford, Mr. Walpole; it is the name by which he is best\r\nknown in the literary world, and to which his writings have given a\r\ncelebrity much beyond what any hereditary honour can bestow.\" Mr.\r\nJohnson observes:--\"To his sketch of the improvements introduced by\r\nBridgman and Kent, and those garden artists, their immediate successors,\r\nwe may afford the best praise; he appears to be a faithful, and is, an\r\neloquent annalist.\" It is impossible to pass by this tribute, without\r\nreminding my reader, that Mr. Johnson's own review of our ornamental\r\ngardening, is energetic and luminous; as is indeed the whole of his\r\ncomprehensive general review of gardening, from the earliest period,\r\ndown to the close of the last century.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HON. DAINES BARRINGTON. He devoted himself to literary pursuits; was\r\na profound antiquary, and a truly worthy man. He died in 1800, aged 73,\r\nat his chambers in the Temple, and was buried in the Temple church. The\r\nattractive improvements in the gardens there, may be said to have\r\noriginated with him. He possibly looked on them as classic ground; for\r\nin these gardens, the proud Somerset vowed to dye their white rose to a\r\nbloody red, and Warwick prophesied that their brawl\r\n\r\n                          ----in the Temple garden,\r\n   Shall send, between the red rose and the white,\r\n   A thousand souls to death and deadly night.\r\n\r\nHe published,\r\n\r\n     1. Observations on the more Ancient Statutes, 4to. To the 5th\r\n     edition of which, in 1796, is prefixed his portrait.\r\n\r\n     2. The Naturalist's Calendar, 8vo.\r\n\r\n     3. A translation of Orosius, ascribed to Alfred, with notes, 8vo.\r\n\r\n     4. Tracts on the probability of reaching the North Pole, 4to.\r\n\r\n     5. In vol. vii. of the Archaeologia, is his paper On the Progress of\r\n     Gardening. It was printed as a separate tract by Mr. Nichols, price\r\n     1s. 6d.\r\n\r\n     6. Miscellanies on various subjects, 4to.\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols, in his Life of Bowyer, calls him \"a man of amiable\r\ncharacter, polite, communicative and liberal;\" and in the fifth volume\r\nof his Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century,\r\nhe gives a neatly engraved portrait of Mr. Barrington, and some\r\nmemorials or letters of his. Mr. Boswell (\"the cheerful, the pleasant,\r\nthe inimitable biographer of his illustrious friend\"), thus relates Dr.\r\nJohnson's wish to become acquainted with Mr. Barrington:--\"Soon after he\r\nhad published his excellent Observations on the Statutes, Johnson\r\nwaited on that worthy and learned gentleman, and having told him his\r\nname, courteously said, 'I have read your book, Sir, with great\r\npleasure, and wish to be better known to you.' Thus began an\r\nacquaintance which was continued with mutual regard as long as Johnson\r\nlived.\" John Harris, Esq. the learned author of Philological Enquiries,\r\nthus speaks of Mr. Barrington's Observations on the Statutes:--\"a\r\nvaluable work, concerning which it is difficult to decide, whether it is\r\nmore entertaining or more instructive.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH CRADOCK, Esq. whose \"Village Memoirs\" display his fine taste in\r\nlandscape gardening. This feeling and generous-minded man, whose gentle\r\nmanners, polite learning, and excellent talents, entitled him to an\r\nacquaintance with the first characters of the age, died in 1826, at the\r\ngreat age of eighty-five. This classical scholar and polished gentleman,\r\nwho had (as a correspondent observes in the Gentleman's Magazine for\r\nJanuary, 1827) \"the habit of enlivening and embellishing every thing\r\nwhich he said with a certain lightning of eye and honied tone of voice,\"\r\nshone in the first literary circles, and ranked as his intimate and\r\nvalued friends (among many other enlightened persons), David Garrick,\r\nand Warburton, Hurd, Johnson, Goldsmith, Percy, and Parr. Dr. Johnson\r\ncalled him \"a very pleasing gentleman.\" Indeed, he appears from every\r\naccount to have been in all respects an amiable and accomplished person.\r\nHe had the honour of being selected to dance a minuet with the most\r\ngraceful of all dancers, Mrs. Garrick, at the Stratford Jubilee. It was\r\nto Mr. Cradock, that Dr. Farmer addressed his unanswerable Essay on the\r\nLearning of Shakspeare. In acts of humanity and kindness, he was\r\nsurpassed by few. Pope's line of _the gay conscience of a life well\r\nspent_, might well have been applied to Mr. Cradock. When in\r\nLeicestershire, \"he was respected by people of all parties for his\r\nworth, and idolized by the poor for his benevolence.\" This honest and\r\nhonourable man, depicted his own mind in the concluding part of his\r\ninscription, for the banks of the lake he formed in his romantic and\r\npicturesque grounds, in that county:--\r\n\r\n   _Here on the bank Pomona's blossoms glow,\r\n   And finny myriads sparkle from below;\r\n   Here let the mind at peaceful anchor rest,\r\n   And heaven's own sunshine cheer the guiltless breast._[97]\r\n\r\nIn 1773 he partly took his \"Zobeide\" from an unfinished tragedy by\r\nVoltaire. On sending a copy to Ferney, the enlightened veteran thus\r\nconcluded his answer: \"You have done too much honour to an old sick man\r\nof eighty. I am, with the most sincere esteem and gratitude,\r\n\r\n   \"Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n   \"VOLTAIRE.\"[98]\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain from adding a short extract from the above quoted\r\nmagazine, as it brings to one's memory another much esteemed and worthy\r\nman:--\"Here, perhaps, it may be allowable to allude to the sincere\r\nattachment between Mr. Cradock, and his old friend Mr. Nichols. For\r\nvery many years Mr. Nichols had been accustomed to pay Mr. Cradock an\r\nannual visit at Gumley Hall; but on Mr. Cradock settling in London, the\r\nintercourse became incessant, and we doubt not that the daily\r\ncorrespondence which took place between them, contributed to cheer the\r\nlatter days of these two veterans in literature. They had both of them\r\nin early life enjoyed the flattering distinction of an intimacy with the\r\nsame eminent characters; and to hear the different anecdotes elicited in\r\ntheir animated conversations respecting Johnson and others, was indeed\r\nan intellectual treat of no ordinary description. Mr. Cradock and Mr.\r\nNichols possessed a similarity in taste and judgment. They were both\r\nendowed with peculiar quickness of comprehension, and with powers and\r\naccuracy of memory rarely equalled.\" One may say of the liberal minded\r\nMr. Nichols, what Mr. Murphy said of Dr. Johnson, that his love of\r\nliterature was a passion that stuck to his last stand. The works of Mr.\r\nCradock have, since his decease, been published by Mr. J. B. Nichols, in\r\n4 vols. 8vo. They contain his Essay on Gardening and Village Memoirs.\r\nThey are enriched by a miniature portrait of him, by Hone, in 1764, when\r\nMr. Cradock was in his prime of life, in his twenty-second year, and\r\nwhen his piercing eyes and intelligent countenance, were thought to have\r\nresembled those of Mr. Garrick. There is also a profile shade of Mr.\r\nCradock, taken of him only a month before his decease. In the above\r\nquoted magazine, is a copy of this profile, with a memoir.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR JOSEPH BANKS. There is a fine portrait of him by Russel, engraved by\r\nCollyer. In Mr. Cadell's Contemporary Portraits is another fine one,\r\nfrom the pencil of Lawrence. His portrait is preserved by the\r\nHorticultural Society of London, and in the British Museum is his bust,\r\nchiselled and presented by the Hon. Mrs. Damer. A good copy of the\r\nengraving by Collyer is in the European Magazine for Feb. 1795, and\r\nfrom the memoir there given I select the following:\r\n\r\n\"If to support the dignity of the first literary society in the world,\r\nand by firmness and candour to conciliate the regard of its members; if\r\nrejecting the allurements of dissipation, to explore sciences unknown,\r\nand to cultivate the most manly qualities of the human heart; if to\r\ndispense a princely fortune in the enlargement of science, the\r\nencouragement of genius, and the alleviation of distress, be\r\ncircumstances which entitle any one to a more than ordinary share of\r\nrespect, few will dispute the claim of the person whose portrait\r\nornaments the present magazine.... In short, he is entitled to every\r\npraise that science, liberality, and intelligence can bestow on their\r\nmost distinguished favourites.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Pulteney, in his handsome dedication of his Sketches on the progress\r\nof Botany, to Sir Joseph, thus alludes to his voyage with Cook:--\"To\r\nwhom could a work of this nature with so much propriety be addressed, as\r\nto him who had not only relinquished, for a series of years, all the\r\nallurements that a polished nation could display to opulence; but had\r\nexposed himself to numberless perils, and the repeated risk of life\r\nitself, that he might attain higher degrees of that knowledge, which\r\nthese sketches are intended to communicate.\"\r\n\r\nThe Academy of Sciences at Dijon, in their \"Notice sur Sir Jos. Banks,\"\r\nthus apostrophizes his memory:--\"Ombre de Banks! apparois en ce lieu\r\nconsacre au culte des sciences et des lettres; viens occuper la place\r\nque t'y conservent les muses, accepter les couronnes qu'elles-memes\r\nt'ont tressees! viens recevoir le tribut de nos sentimens, temoignage\r\nsincere de notre douleur et de not regrets; et par le souvenir de tes\r\nvertus, viens enflammer nos coeurs de cet amour pour le bien, qui fut\r\nle mobile de toutes tes actions!\"[99]\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson, in his History of English Gardening, justly calls him \"This\r\nuniversal patron of the arts and sciences. Natural history was the\r\nfavourite of his scientific studies, and every part of it was enriched\r\nby his researches.\" He again hails him as \"a munificent friend of\r\nscience and literature.\" The name of Banks will always be associated\r\nwith that of Solander, the favourite pupil of Linnaeus, and with that of\r\nthe immortal Cook. De Lille closes his _Jardins_ with a most generous\r\nand animated invocation to the memory of this intrepid navigator.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM FALCONER. The portrait of this eminent physician of Bath, is\r\nengraved by Fitler, from a painting by Daniel, of Bath, in 1791. It is\r\nprefixed to his \"Influence of the Passions upon Disorders.\" He died in\r\nAugust, 1824, at the age of eighty-one. He published,\r\n\r\n     1. Essay on the Preservation of the Health of Persons employed in\r\n     Agriculture, 1s. Bath, 1789.\r\n\r\n     2. Miscellaneous Tracts relating to Natural History; selected from\r\n     the principal writers of antiquity. 1793. 4to.\r\n\r\n     3. Remarks on the Influence of Climate, Situation, Nature of\r\n     Country, &c. The Encyclop. of Gardening calls this \"a most\r\n     interesting work.\" A writer in the New Monthly Mag. says \"it\r\n     displays an almost unlimited extent of learning and research.\"\r\n\r\n     4. An Historical View of the Taste for Gardening and Laying out\r\n     Grounds among the Nations of Antiquity. 8vo. 1s. 6d. 1783. _Dilly._\r\n\r\nA list of his other works (nearly twenty in number), may be seen in the\r\nDictionary of Living Authors, or in vol. xii. of the New Monthly Mag.;\r\nwhich last work says that the late Lord Thurlow, at whose table he was\r\nalmost a constant guest, declared that \"he never saw such a man; that he\r\nknew every thing, and knew it better than any one else.\" Neither this\r\nlast publication, nor Dr. Watts in his Bibl. Brit. mention Dr.\r\nFalconer's Historical View of the Taste for Gardening.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CURTIS. This honest, much-esteemed, and inoffensive man, though\r\nso deservedly eminent as a botanist, published only the following work\r\non horticulture:--\"Directions for Cultivating the Crambe Maritima, or\r\nSea-kale for the Use of the Table.\" A new edition, enlarged, with three\r\nengravings. 2s. 6d. Mr. Loudon says, that this pamphlet has done more to\r\nrecommend the culture of _sea-kale_ and diffuse the knowledge of it,\r\nthan all his predecessors. Nearly three pages of the Encyclopaedia are\r\nenriched with the result of all that has appeared on the cultivation of\r\nthis vegetable by English, Scotch, or French writers.\r\n\r\nThe botanical works of Mr. Curtis have long been held in high esteem.\r\nThe first number of his Flora Londinensis appeared in 1777. He commenced\r\nhis Botanical Magazine in 1787. His Observations on British Grasses,\r\nappeared in a second edition, with coloured plates, in 1790. His\r\nLectures were published after his death, to which is prefixed his\r\nportrait. His portrait is also given in Dr. Thornton's Botany. He died\r\nin 1799, was buried in Battersea church-yard, and on his grave-stone\r\nthese lines are inscribed:--\r\n\r\n   _While living herbs shall spring profusely wild,\r\n     Or gardens cherish all that's sweet and gay,\r\n   So long thy works shall please, dear nature's child,\r\n     So long thy memory suffer no decay._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS MARTYN, Professor of Botany at Cambridge, whose striking\r\nportrait, from a picture by Russel, appears in Dr. Thornton's superb\r\nwork on botany. He died in June, 1825, in the ninetieth year of his age.\r\nHis edition of Miller's Gardener's Dictionary, appeared in 4 vols.\r\nfolio. Mr. Johnson observes, that this work \"requires no comment. It is\r\na standard, practical work, never to be surpassed.\" Mr. Martyn also\r\npublished _Flora Rustica_, a description of plants, useful or injurious\r\nin husbandry, _with coloured plates_, 4 vols. 8vo.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR W. CHAMBERS. There are portraits of him by Sir J. Reynolds, engraved\r\nby Collyer and by Green; one by Cotes, engraved by Houston, in 1772; and\r\na profile by Pariset, after a drawing by Falconot. He died in 1796, aged\r\nsixty-nine. He published,\r\n\r\n     1. Designs for Chinese Buildings.\r\n\r\n     2. Plans and Views of the Buildings and Gardens at Kew.\r\n\r\n     3. A Dissertation on Oriental Gardening, second edition, with\r\n     additions. To which is annexed an Explanatory Discourse, 4to.\r\n     1773. This work gave rise to those smart satires, _An Heroic\r\n     Epistle_, and _An Heroic Postscript_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMPHREY REPTON, Esq. His portrait is prefixed to his Observations on\r\nthe Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, folio. 1803. He also\r\npublished on this subject:\r\n\r\n     1. Letter to U. Price, Esq. on Landscape Gardening, 8vo. 1794.\r\n\r\n     2. Sketches and Hints on Landscape Gardening, folio, 1795.\r\n\r\n     3. Enquiry into the Changes in Landscape Gardening, 8vo. 1806.\r\n\r\n     4. On the Introduction of Indian Architecture and Gardening, folio,\r\n     1808.\r\n\r\n     5. On the supposed Effect of Ivy upon Trees. A charming little\r\n     essay inserted in the _Linn. Trans._ vol. xi.\r\n\r\n     6. Fragments on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening,\r\n     4to. 1816. In p. 80 of the Encyclop. of Gardening, is some general\r\n     information respecting Mr. Repton.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM FORSYTH, Esq. His portrait is prefixed to the seventh edition of\r\nhis Treatise on the Culture and Management of Fruit Trees, 8vo. 1824;\r\nalso to the 4to. edition of the same work in 1802. He also published\r\nObservations on the diseases, defects, and injuries in all kinds of\r\nFruit and Forest Trees, with an account of a particular method of cure,\r\n8vo. 1791. Mr. Forsyth died in 1804.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. JAMES DICKSON, who established the well-known seed and herb shop in\r\nCovent-garden, and died at the age of eighty-six, a few years ago,\r\nappears to have been very much esteemed. His family at Croydon possess\r\nhis portrait, and there is another preserved by the Horticultural\r\nSociety. He married for his second wife a sister of the intrepid\r\ntraveller Mungo Park. Mr. Dickson, when searching for plants in the\r\nHebrides, in 1789, was accompanied by him. Handsome mention is made of\r\nMr. Dickson in the Life of Mungo Park, prefixed to the \"Journal of a\r\nMission to the Interior of Africa.\" In the above life, the friendly and\r\ngenerous assistance which Sir Joseph Banks shewed both to Mr. Dickson,\r\nand to Mungo Park, is very pleasingly recorded. A memoir of Mr. Dickson\r\nis given in the 5th vol. of the Hort. Transactions. He published,\r\nFasciculus Plantarum Cryptog. Brit. 4 parts 4to. 1785-1801.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD PAYNE KNIGHT, Esq. author of The Landscape, a didactic poem,\r\n4to. 1794. A second edition, _with a preface_, appeared in 4to. in 1795.\r\nThis poem is the only production of Mr. Knight, on the subject of\r\nlandscape scenery, except his occasional allusions thereto, in his\r\nAnalytical Enquiry into the Principles of Taste, the second edition of\r\nwhich appeared in 8vo. in 1805. This latter work embraces a variety of\r\nsubjects, and contains many energetic pages, particularly those on\r\nHomer, and on the English drama. His philosophical survey of human life\r\n\"in its last stages,\" (at p. 461), and where he alludes to \"the hooks\r\nand links which hold the affections of age,\" is worthy of all praise; it\r\nis deep, solemn, and affecting. The other publications of this gentleman\r\nare enumerated in Dr. Watts's Bibl. Brit. Mr. Knight, in his Landscape,\r\nafter invoking the genius of Virgil, in reference to his\r\n\r\n   _----O qui me gelidis in vallibus Hoemi\r\n   Sistat, et ingenti ramorum protegat unbra,_\r\n\r\nthus proceeds, after severely censuring Mr. _Browne_, who\r\n\r\n   ----bade the stream 'twixt banks close shaved to glide;\r\n   Banish'd the thickets of high-bowering wood,\r\n   Which hung, reflected o'er the glassy flood:\r\n   Where screen'd and shelter'd from the heats of day,\r\n   Oft on the moss-grown stone reposed I lay,\r\n   And tranquil view'd the limpid stream below,\r\n   Brown with o'er hanging shade, in circling eddies flow.\r\n     Dear peaceful scenes, that now prevail no more,\r\n   Your loss shall every weeping muse deplore!\r\n   Your poet, too, in one dear favour'd spot,\r\n   Shall shew your beauties are not quite forgot:\r\n   Protect from all the sacrilegious waste\r\n   Of false improvement, and pretended taste,\r\n   _One tranquil vale!_[100] where oft, from care retir'd\r\n   He courts the muse, and thinks himself inspired;\r\n   Lulls busy thought, and rising hope to rest,\r\n   And checks each wish that dares his peace molest.\r\n\r\nAfter scorning \"wisdom's solemn empty toys,\" he proceeds:\r\n\r\n     Let me, retir'd from business, toil, and strife,\r\n   Close amidst books and solitude my life;\r\n   Beneath yon high-brow'd rocks in thickets rove,\r\n   Or, meditating, wander through the grove;\r\n   Or, from the cavern, view the noontide beam\r\n   Dance on the rippling of the lucid stream,\r\n   While the wild woodbine dangles o'er my head,\r\n   And various flowers around their fragrance spread.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   Then homeward as I sauntering move along,\r\n   The nightingale begins his evening song;\r\n   Chanting a requiem to departed light,\r\n   That smooths the raven down of sable night.\r\n\r\nAfter an animated tribute to _Homer_, he reviews the rising and the\r\nslumbering, or drooping of the arts, midst storms of war, and gloomy\r\nbigotry.\r\n\r\n   Hail, arts divine!--still may your solace sweet\r\n   Cheer the recesses of my calm retreat;\r\n   And banish every mean pursuit, that dares\r\n   Cloud life's serene with low ambitious cares.\r\n     Vain is the pomp of wealth: its splendid halls,\r\n   And vaulted roofs, sustain'd by marble walls.--\r\n   In beds of state pale sorrow often sighs,\r\n   Nor gets relief from gilded canopies:\r\n   But arts can still new recreation find,\r\n   To soothe the troubles of th' afflicted mind;\r\n   Recall the ideal work of ancient days,\r\n   And man in his own estimation raise;\r\n   Visions of glory to his eyes impart,\r\n   And cheer with conscious pride his drooping heart.\r\n\r\nAfter a review of our several timber trees, and a tribute to our native\r\nstreams, and woods; and after describing in happy lines _Kamtschatka's_\r\ndreary coast, he concludes his poem with reflections on the ill-fated\r\n_Queen of France_, whose\r\n\r\n   Waning beauty, in the dungeon's gloom,\r\n   Feels, yet alive, the horrors of the tomb!\r\n\r\nMr. Knight's portrait, painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence, is preserved at\r\nDownton Castle, near Ludlow; and is engraved among Cadell's Contemporary\r\nPortraits. It is also engraved by Bromley, from the same painter.\r\nAnother portrait was in the library of the late Mr. Johnes, at Havod.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. ANDREW DUNCAN. He died at Edinburgh in June 1828, at the great age\r\nof eighty-four. His portrait was drawn by Raiburn, and engraved by\r\nMitchell. He was a contemporary of several eminent persons, whose\r\nsociety and friendship formed one of the chief pleasures of his life.\r\nThere was scarcely an institution proposed for the benefit of his native\r\ncity, Edinburgh, to which his name will not be found a contributor. He\r\nwas, in fact, the patron and benefactor of all public charities. In 1809\r\nhe projected, and by his exertions, succeeded in establishing, the\r\nHorticultural Society of Edinburgh. His animated and scientific\r\ndiscourses, delivered at the meetings of the Caledonian Horticultural\r\nSociety, will always be perused with eager pleasure by every\r\nhorticulturist. In that delivered in December, 1814, and inserted in the\r\nfifth number of their Memoirs, this zealous well-wisher of his native\r\ncity, thus exults:--\"I am now, gentlemen, past the seventieth year of my\r\nage, and I have been a steady admirer both of Flora and Pomona from the\r\nvery earliest period of my youth. During a pretty long life, it has been\r\nmy lot to have had opportunities of visiting gardens in three different\r\nquarters of the globe, in Europe, in Asia, and in Africa; and from what\r\nI have seen, I am decidedly of opinion, that at the present day, there\r\nis not a large city in the world, which enjoys a supply of vegetable\r\nfood in more abundance, in greater variety, or in higher excellence,\r\nthan the city of Edinburgh. From the potatoe to the pine-apple,--from\r\nthe most useful to the most delicious productions of the vegetable\r\nkingdom, we are not at present outdone, as far as my observation goes,\r\nby any large city on the face of the earth.\" His medical talents may\r\nwell be believed not to have been small, when it is told, that he was\r\nthe rival in practice, and by no means an unsuccessful one, of the\r\nillustrious Cullen, of the Monros, and of Gregory. In private life, Dr.\r\nDuncan was eminently distinguished for his sociality, and the desire to\r\nbenefit all mankind. He was a member of several social clubs. His\r\nfavourite amusement was _gardening_. He possessed a garden in the\r\nneighbourhood of Edinburgh, which he cultivated entirely with his own\r\nhands, and on the door of which was placed, in conspicuous letters,\r\n'_hinc salus_.' He was particularly kind to the students attending his\r\nlectures, and gave a tea-drinking every Sunday evening to about a dozen\r\nof them, by rotation, who assembled at six o'clock and went away at\r\neight. When old, he used sometimes to forget the lapse of time, and in\r\nhis lectures, frequently spoke about the _late_ Mr. Haller, who lived a\r\ncentury before. To the last year of his life he never omitted going up,\r\non the morning of the 1st of May, to wash his face in the dew of the\r\nsummit of a mountain near Edinburgh, called Arthur's Seat. He had the\r\nmerit of being the father of the present Dr. Duncan, the celebrated\r\nauthor of the Edinburgh Dispensatory, and professor of materia medica.\r\nDr. Duncan's funeral was properly made a public one, at which the\r\nprofessors, magistrates, and medical bodies of Edinburgh attended, to\r\ntestify their sorrow and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR UVEDALE PRICE. His portrait was taken by Sir Thomas Lawrence, and is\r\nnow at Foxley.[101] The Hereford Journal of Wednesday, September 16,\r\n1829, thus relates his decease:--\"On Monday last died, at Foxley, in\r\nthis county, Sir Uvedale Price, Bart. in the eighty-third year of his\r\nage. The obituary of 1829 will not record a name more gifted or more\r\ndear! In a county where he was one of the oldest, as well as one of the\r\nmost constant of its inhabitants, it were superfluous to enumerate his\r\nmany claims to distinction and regret. His learning, his sagacity, his\r\nexquisite taste, his indefatigable ardour, would have raised to eminence\r\na man much less conspicuous by his station in life, by his\r\ncorrespondence with the principal literati of Europe, and by the\r\nattraction and polish of his conversation and manners. Possessing his\r\nadmirable faculties to so venerable an age, we must deplore that a\r\ngentleman who conferred such honour on our county is removed from that\r\nlearned retirement in which he delighted, and from that enchanting scene\r\nwhich, in every sense, he so greatly adorned. He is succeeded in his\r\ntitle by his only son, now Sir Robert Price, one of our\r\nrepresentatives.\"\r\n\r\nSir Uvedale published the following:\r\n\r\n     1. An Essay on the Picturesque, as compared with the Sublime and\r\n     Beautiful, and on the use of studying pictures for the purpose of\r\n     improving real landscape, 8vo. 1794. This volume was afterwards\r\n     published in 1796, in 8vo. with _considerable additions_, and in\r\n     1798 was published at _Hereford_ a second volume, being an Essay on\r\n     Artificial Water, an Essay on Decorations near the House, and an\r\n     Essay on Architecture and Buildings as connected with Scenery.\r\n\r\n     2. A Letter to H. Repton, Esq. on the application of the practice\r\n     and principles of Landscape Painting to Landscape Gardening.\r\n     Intended as a supplement to the Essays. To which is prefixed Mr.\r\n     Repton's Letter to Mr. Price. Lond. 1795, 8vo. Second edition,\r\n     _Hereford_, 1798, 8vo. This is a sportive display of pleasant wit,\r\n     polished learning, and deep admiration of the great landscape\r\n     painters. Keen as some of his pages are, and lamenting that there\r\n     should have been any controversy (\"or tilting at each other's\r\n     breasts,\") on the subject of Launcelot Browne's works, \"I trust,\r\n     (says he,) however, that my friends will vouch for me, that\r\n     whatever sharpness there may be in my style, there is no rancour in\r\n     my heart.\" Mr. Repton in his Enquiry into the Changes of Landscape\r\n     Gardening, acknowledges \"the elegant and gentleman-like manner in\r\n     which Mr. Price has examined my opinions.\" Indeed, many pages in\r\n     this present letter shew this.\r\n\r\n     3. A Dialogue on the distinct Characters of the Picturesque and the\r\n     Beautiful, in answer to the objections of Mr. Knight, 1801,\r\n     8vo.[102]\r\n\r\nA general review of Sir Uvedale's ideas on this subject, is candidly\r\ngiven by Mr. Loudon at p. 78 of his Encyclop. after a mature study of\r\n_all_ the modern writers who have endeavoured to form \"a taste for the\r\nharmony and connection of natural scenery.\" Mr. Loudon farther calls him\r\n\"the great reformer of landscape gardening.\"\r\n\r\nWe have to regret, that though so many springs must have cheered the\r\nlong life of Sir Uvedale Price, (and which he calls the _dolce prima\r\nvera, gioventu dell'anno_, and whose blossoms, flowers, and\r\n\"profusion of fresh, gay, and beautiful colours and sweets,\" he so\r\nwarmly dwelt on in many of his pages,) and though the number of these\r\nsprings must have nearly equalled those which gilded the days of Lord\r\nKames, of the honourable Horace Walpole, of Mr. Gilpin, and of Joseph\r\nCradock, Esq. yet we have to regret that his classic pen has presented\r\nto the public no other efforts of his genius and cultivated taste, than\r\nthe few respectable ones above stated. Had he chose to have indulged his\r\nown powers in describing what has been done towards \"embellishing the\r\nface of this noble kingdom,\" (to quote his own words,) we might have\r\nperused descriptive pages equal to his own critical and refined review\r\nof Blenheim, or of Powis Castle, and of a character as high and pure, as\r\nthose of Thomas Whateley. In proof of this, we need only refer to many\r\npages in his Essays,--not only when he so well paints the charms of\r\nsequestered nature, whether in its deep recesses, _o'er canopied with\r\nluscious eglantine_,--in the \"modest and retired character of a\r\nbrook,\"--the rural simplicity of a cottage, with its lilacs and fruit\r\ntrees, its rustic porch, covered with vine or ivy, but when he dwells on\r\nthe ruins and on \"the religious calm\" of our abbeys,[103] or on our old\r\nmansion-houses, with their terraces, their summer-houses covered with\r\nivy, and mixed with wild vegetation. And we need farther only to refer\r\nto those feeling pages in his second volume, where he laments that his\r\nown youth and inexperience should (in order to follow the silly folly of\r\n_being in the fashion_,) have doomed to sudden and total destruction an\r\nold paternal garden, with all its embellishments, and whose destruction\r\nrevives in these pages all the emotions of his youth; and he concludes\r\nthese pages of regret, by candidly confessing, that he gained little but\r\n\"much difficulty, expence and dirt,\" and that he thus detains his\r\nreaders in relating what so personally concerns himself, \"because there\r\nis nothing so useful to others, however humiliating to ourselves, as\r\nthe frank confession of our errors and of their causes. No man can\r\nequally with the person who committed them, impress upon others the\r\nextent of the mischief done, and the regret that follows it.\" It is\r\npainful to quit pages so interesting as those that immediately follow\r\nthis quotation.[104]\r\n\r\nThere are few objects that the enlightened mind of Sir Uvedale has not\r\nremarked. Take the following as an instance:\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is so captivating, or seems so much to accord with our ideas of\r\nbeauty, as the smiles of a beautiful countenance; yet they have\r\nsometimes a striking mixture of the other character. Of this kind are\r\nthose smiles which break out suddenly from a serious, sometimes from\r\nalmost a severe countenance, and which, when that gleam is over, leave\r\nno trace of it behind--\r\n\r\n   _Brief as the lightning in the collied night,\r\n   That in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth,\r\n   And e'er a man has time to say, behold!\r\n   The jaws of darkness do devour it up._\r\n\r\nThere is another smile, which seems in the same degree to accord with\r\nthe ideas of beauty only: it is that smile which proceeds from a mind\r\nfull of sweetness and sensibility, and which, when it is over, still\r\nleaves on the countenance its mild and amiable impression; as after the\r\nsun is set, the mild glow of his rays is still diffused over every\r\nobject. This smile, with the glow that accompanies it, is beautifully\r\npainted by Milton, as most becoming an inhabitant of heaven:\r\n\r\n   To whom the angel, with a smile that glow'd\r\n   Celestial rosy red, love's proper hue,\r\n   Thus answered.\"\r\n\r\nThe great object in the above Essays, is to improve the laying out of\r\ngrounds by studying the productions \"of those great artists _who have\r\nmost diligently studied the beauties of nature_. On this subject he has\r\nin these volumes poured forth the effusions of his richly gifted mind,\r\nin his contemplation of the works of those really great painters, whose\r\nlandscape scenery, from the most rural to the grandest, \"have been\r\nconsecrated by long uninterrupted admiration.\" Instead of the narrow,\r\nmechanical practice of a few English gardeners, or layers-out of\r\ngrounds, he wishes \"the noble and varied works of the eminent painters\r\nof every age, and of every country, and those of _their_ supreme\r\nmistress NATURE, should be the great models of imitation.\"[105] He has\r\nsupported many of his opinions or observations, or embellished or\r\nenlivened them, by acute allusions, not only to Milton but to\r\nShakspeare, whom he calls \"that most original creator, and most accurate\r\nobserver.\"[106]\r\n\r\nHe has depicted his own mind in p. 378 of the first volume of his\r\nEssays; for after lamenting that despotic system of improvement which\r\ndemands all to be laid open,--all that obstructs to be levelled to the\r\nground,--houses, orchards, gardens, all swept away,--nothing tending to\r\nhumanize the mind--and that a despot thinks every person an intruder who\r\nenters his domain, wishing to destroy cottages and pathways, and to\r\nreign alone, he thus proceeds:--\"Here I cannot resist paying a tribute\r\nto the memory of a beloved uncle, and recording a benevolence towards\r\nall the inhabitants around him, that struck me from my earliest\r\nremembrance; and it is an impression I wish always to cherish. It seemed\r\nas if he had made his extensive walks as much for them as for himself;\r\nthey used them as freely, and their enjoyment was his. The village bore\r\nas strong marks of his and of his brother's attentions (for in that\r\nrespect they appeared to have but one mind), to the comforts and\r\npleasures of its inhabitants. Such attentive kindnesses, are amply\r\nrepaid by affectionate regard and reverence; and were they general\r\nthroughout the kingdom, they would do much more towards guarding us\r\nagainst democratical opinions\r\n\r\n   _Than twenty thousand soldiers, arm'd in proof._\r\n\r\nThe cheerfulness of the scene I have mentioned, and all the interesting\r\ncircumstances attending it, (so different from those of solitary\r\ngrandeur,) have convinced me, that he who destroys dwellings, gardens\r\nand inclosures, for the sake of mere extent, and parade of property,\r\nonly extends the bounds of monotony, and of dreary, selfish pride; but\r\ncontrasts those of vanity, amusement and humanity.\"\r\n\r\nOne may trace, too, his feeling mind towards the conclusion of his\r\nsecond volume, where, after many pleasing pages on the rural scenery of\r\ncottages, and in hamlets and villages, (\"where a lover of humanity may\r\nfind so many sources of amusement and interest,\") and on the means of\r\nembellishing them, \"I could wish (says he) to turn the minds of\r\nimprovers from too much attachment to solitary parade, towards objects\r\nmore connected with general habitation and embellishment; ... and it may\r\nbe truly said, that there is no way in which wealth can produce such\r\nnatural unaffected variety, and such interest, as by adorning a real\r\nvillage, and promoting the comforts and enjoyments of its inhabitants.\r\n_Goldsmith_ has most feelingly described (more, I trust, from the warmth\r\nof a poetical imagination and quick sensibility than from real fact),\r\nthe ravages of wealthy pride. My aim is to shew, that they are no less\r\nhostile to real taste, than to humanity; and should I succeed, it is\r\npossible that those, whom all the affecting images and pathetic touches\r\nof Goldsmith would not have restrained from destroying a village, may\r\neven be induced to build one, in order to shew their taste in the\r\ndecoration and disposition of village-houses and cottages.\" After many\r\ntraces of village scenery, he thus proceeds: \"The church, together with\r\nthe church-yard, is, on various accounts, an interesting object to the\r\nvillagers of every age and disposition; to the old and serious, as a\r\nspot consecrated to the purposes of religion, where the living christian\r\nperforms his devotions, and where, after his death, his body is\r\ndeposited near those of his ancestors and departed friends, and\r\nrelations: to the young and thoughtless, as a place where, on the day of\r\nrest from labour, they meet each other in their holiday clothes; and\r\nalso (what forms a singular contrast with tombs and grave-stones), as\r\nthe place which at their wakes, is the chief scene of their gaiety and\r\nrural sports.\" After speaking of the yew, which from the solemnity of\r\nits foliage, is most suited to church-yards, being as much consecrated\r\nto the dead as the cypress among the ancients, he says that \"there seems\r\nto be no reason, why in the more southern parts of England, cypresses\r\nshould not be mixed with yews, or why cedars of Libanus, which are\r\nperfectly hardy, and of a much quicker growth than yews, should not be\r\nintroduced. In high romantic situations, particularly, where the\r\nchurch-yard is elevated above the general level, a cedar, spreading his\r\nbranches downwards from that height, would have the most picturesque,\r\nand at the same time, the most solemn effect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nPage 5.--I am enabled from Mr. Johnson's lately published History of\r\nEnglish Gardening, to add a very early tract on that subject, and I take\r\nthe liberty of transcribing his exact words: \"A Boke of Husbandry,\r\nLondon, 4to. This little work is very rare, being one of the productions\r\nfrom the press of Wynkin de Worde. It consists of but twelve leaves, and\r\nis without date, but certainly was not of a later year than 1500. The\r\nfollowing extracts explain its nature. 'Here begyneth a treatyse of\r\nHusbandry which Mayster Groshede somtyme Bysshop of Lyncoln made, and\r\ntranslated it out of Frensshe into Englyshe, whiche techeth all maner of\r\nmen to governe theyr londes, tenementes, and demesnes ordinately.'\r\n\r\n'Here endeth the Boke of Husbandry, _and of Plantynge, and Graffynge of\r\nTrees and Vynes_.'\"\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1797 the late Mr. Nichols printed the Life of Robert\r\n_Grosseteste_, the celebrated Bishop of Lincoln.

Price 13s. in boards.\r\n\r\nPage 17.--I have in this page alluded to the hard fate of Correggio.\r\nThat my reader may know who he was, let him inspect those pages in vol.\r\ni. of Sir U. Price's Essays, where he thus concludes a critique on his\r\ngenius: \"I believe that if a variety of persons, conversant in painting,\r\nwere asked what pictures (taking every circumstance together) appeared\r\nto them most beautiful, and had left the softest and most pleasing\r\nimpression,--the majority would fix upon Correggio.\"\r\n\r\nPage 17.--W. Lawson, in the dedication to his New Orchard and Garden,\r\ngives the name of an author on gardening, whose book I have not met\r\nwith. He dedicates it \"to the right worshipfull _Sir Henry Belosses_,\"\r\nand he acknowledges, \"1st. the many courtesies you have vouchsaved me.\r\n2dly. your delightfull skill in matters of this nature. 3dly. the profit\r\nwhich I received from your _learned discourse of Fruit-trees_. 4thly.\r\nyour animating and assisting of others to such endeavours. Last of all,\r\nthe rare worke of your owne in this kind, all which to publish under\r\nyour protection, I have adventured as you see.\" From this it would\r\nappear, that this \"learned discourse\" is transfused into the New Orchard\r\nand Garden. After all, perhaps, this \"learned discourse\" was merely in\r\nconversation. At all events, it has recorded the name of Sir Henry as\r\nwarmly devoted to orcharding, or to horticulture. W. Lawson, in his\r\npreface, dwells upon the praises of this art, \"how some, and not a few\r\nof the best, have accounted it a chiefe part of earthly happinesse to\r\nhave faire and pleasant orchards--how ancient, how profitable, how\r\npleasant it is.\" His fourteenth chapter is On the Age of Fruit-trees.\r\nAfter stating that some \"shall dure 1000 years,\" and the age of many of\r\nthe apple-trees in his little orchard, he says: \"If my trees be 100\r\nyeares old, and yet want 200 of their growth before they leave\r\nincreasing, which make 300, then we must needs resolve, that this 300\r\nyeere are but the third part of a tree's life, because (as all things\r\nliving besides) so trees must have allowed them for their increase one\r\nthird, another third for their stand, and a third part of time also for\r\ntheir decay.\"--\"So that I resolve upon good reason, that Fruit-trees\r\nwell ordered, may live and live 1000 yeeres, and beare fruit, and the\r\nlonger, the more, the greater, and the better, because his vigour is\r\nproud and stronger, when his yeeres are many. You shall see old trees\r\nput their buds and blossoms both sooner and more plentifully than young\r\ntrees by much. And I sensibly perceive my young trees to inlarge their\r\nfruit, as they grow greater, both for number, and greatnesse.\"--\"And if\r\nFruit-trees last to this age, how many ages is it to be supposed, strong\r\nand huge Timber-trees will last? whose huge bodies require the yeeres of\r\ndivers _Methushalaes_, before they end their days; whose sap is strong\r\nand better, whose barke is hard and thicke, and their substance solid\r\nand stiffe: all which are defences of health and long life. Their\r\nstrength withstands all forcible winds.\" His seventeenth chapter is on\r\nthe Ornaments of an Orchard. I here give the whole of that chapter:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Me thinks hitherto we haue but a bare Orchard for fruit, and but halfe\r\ngood, so long as it wants those comely ornaments, that should giue\r\nbeauty to all our labours, and make much for the honest delight of the\r\nowner and his friends.\r\n\r\n\"For it is not to be doubted: but as God hath giuen man things\r\nprofitable, so hath he allowed him honest comfort, delight, and\r\nrecreation in all the workes of his hands. Nay, all his labours vnder\r\nthe sunne without this are troubles, and vexation of mind: For what is\r\ngreedy gaine, without delight, but moyling, and turmoyling slauery? But\r\ncomfortable delight, with content, is the good of euery thing, and the\r\npatterne of heauen. A morsell of bread with comfort, is better by much\r\nthan a fat oxe with vnquietnesse. And who can deny, but the principall\r\nend of an Orchard, is the honest delight of one wearied with the works\r\nof his lawfull calling? The very workes of and in an Orchard and Garden,\r\nare better than the ease and rest of and from other labours. When God\r\nhad made man after his owne image, in a perfect state, and would haue\r\nhim to represent himselfe in authority, tranquillity and pleasure vpon\r\nthe earth, he placed him in Paradise. What was Paradise? but a Garden\r\nand Orchard of trees and hearbs, full of pleasure? and nothing there but\r\ndelights. The gods of the earth, resembling the great God of heauen in\r\nauthority, maiestie, and abundance of all things, wherein is their most\r\ndelight? and whither doe they withdraw themselues from the troublesome\r\naffaires of their estate, being tyred with the hearing and iudging of\r\nlitigious Controuersies? choked (as it were) with the close ayres of\r\ntheir sumptuous buildings, their stomacks cloyed with variety of\r\nBanquets, their eares filled and ouerburthened with tedious\r\ndiscoursings? whither? but into their Orchards, made and prepared,\r\ndressed and destinated for that purpose, to renue and refresh their\r\nsences, and to call home their ouer-wearied spirits. Nay, it is (no\r\ndoubt) a comfort to them, to set open their cazements into a most\r\ndelicate Garden and Orchard, whereby they may not onely see that,\r\nwherein they are so much delighted, but also to giue fresh, sweet, and\r\npleasant ayre to their galleries and chambers.\r\n\r\n\"And looke, what these men do by reason of their greatnes and ability,\r\nprouoked with delight, the same doubtlesse would euery of vs doe, if\r\npower were answerable to our desires, whereby we shew manifestly, that\r\nof all other delights on earth, they that are taken by Orchards, are\r\nmost excellent, and most agreeing with nature.\r\n\r\n\"For whereas euery other pleasure commonly filles some one of our\r\nsences, and that onely, with delight, this makes all our sences swimme\r\nin pleasure, and that with infinite variety, ioyned with no less\r\ncommodity.\r\n\r\n\"That famous philosopher, and matchlesse orator, M. T. C. prescribeth\r\nnothing more fit, to take away the tediousnesse and heauy load of three\r\nor foure score yeeres, than the pleasure of an Orchard.\r\n\r\n\"What can your eyes desire to see, your ears to hear, your mouth to\r\ntast, or your nose to smell, that is not to be had in an Orchard, with\r\nabundance and variety? What more delightsome than an infinite variety of\r\nsweet smelling flowers? decking with sundry colours, the greene mantle\r\nof the earth, vniuersall mother of vs all, so by them bespotted, so\r\ndyed, that all the world cannot sample them, and wherein it is more fit\r\nto admire the Dyer, than imitate his workemanship. Colouring not onely\r\nthe earth, but decking the ayre, and sweetning euery breath and spirit.\r\n\r\n\"The rose red, damaske, veluet, and double double prouince rose, the\r\nsweet muske rose, double and single, the double and single white rose.\r\nThe faire and sweet senting Woodbinde, double and single, and double\r\ndouble. Purple cowslips, and double cowslips, and double double\r\ncowslips. Primerose double and single. The violet nothing behinde the\r\nbest, for smelling sweetly. A thousand more will prouoke your content.\r\n\r\n\"And all these, by the skill of your gardner, so comely, and orderly\r\nplaced in your borders and squares, and so intermingled, that none\r\nlooking thereon, cannot but wonder, to see, what Nature corrected by Art\r\ncan doe.\r\n\r\n\"When you behold in diuers corners of your Orchard Mounts of stone, or\r\nwood curiously wrought within and without, or of earth couered with\r\nfruit-trees: Kentish cherry, damsons, plummes, &c. with staires of\r\nprecious workmanship. And in some corner (or moe) a true dyall or\r\nClocke, and some anticke workes, and especially siluer-sounding musique,\r\nmixt instruments and voices, gracing all the rest: How will you be rapt\r\nwith delight?\r\n\r\n\"Large walkes, broad and long, close and open, like the Tempe groves in\r\nThessalie, raised with grauell and sand, hauing seats and bankes of\r\ncammomile, all this delights the minde, and brings health to the body.\r\n\r\n\"View now with delight the workes of your owne hands, your fruit-trees\r\nof all sorts, loaden with sweet blossomes, and fruit of all tasts,\r\noperations, and colours: your trees standing in comely order which way\r\nsoeuer you looke.\r\n\r\n\"Your borders on euery side hanging and drooping with feberries,\r\nraspberries, barberries, currens, and the rootes of your trees powdred\r\nwith strawberries, red, white, and greene, what a pleasure is this? Your\r\ngardner can frame your lesser wood to the shape of men armed in the\r\nfield, ready to giue battell: or swift running greyhounds: or of well\r\nsented and true running hounds, to chase the deere, or hunt the hare.\r\nThis kind of hunting shall not waste your corne, nor much your coyne.\r\n\r\n\"Mazes well framed a mans height, may perhaps make your friends wander\r\nin gathering of berries, till he cannot recouer himselfe without your\r\nhelpe.\r\n\r\n\"To haue occasion to exercise within your Orchard: it shall be a\r\npleasure to haue a bowling alley, or rather (which is more manly, and\r\nmore healthfull) a paire of buts, to stretch your armes.\r\n\r\n\"Rosemary and sweete eglantine are seemely ornaments about a doore or\r\nwindow, and so is woodbinde.\r\n\r\n\"And in mine opinion, I could highly commend your Orchard, if either\r\nthrough it, or hard by it there should runne a pleasant riuer with\r\nsiluer streames: you might sit in your mount, and angle a pickled trout,\r\nor sleightie eele, or some other dainty fish. Or moats, whereon you\r\nmight row with a boate, and fish with nettes.\r\n\r\n\"Store of bees in a dry and warme bee-house, comely made of fir-boords,\r\nto sing, and sit, and feede vpon your flowers and sprouts, make a\r\npleasant noyse and sight. For cleanely and innocent bees, of all other\r\nthings, loue and become, and thriue in an Orchard. If they thriue (as\r\nthey must needes, if your gardner bee skilfull, and loue them: for they\r\nloue their friends, and hate none but their enemies) they will, besides\r\nthe pleasure, yeeld great profit, to pay him his wages. Yea, the\r\nincrease of twenty stockes or stooles, with other fees, will keepe your\r\nOrchard.\r\n\r\n\"You need not doubt their stings, for they hurt not whom they know, and\r\nthey know their keeper and acquaintance. If you like not to come amongst\r\nthem, you need not doubt them: for but neere their store, and in their\r\nowne defence, they will not fight, and in that case onely (and who can\r\nblame them?) they are manly, and fight desperately. Some (as that\r\nHonorable Lady at Hacknes, whose name doth much grace mine Orchard) vse\r\nto make seats for them in the stone wall of their Orchard, or Garden,\r\nwhich is good, but wood is better.\r\n\r\n\"A vine ouer-shadowing a seate, is very comely, though her grapes with\r\nvs ripe slowly.\r\n\r\n\"One chiefe grace that adornes an Orchard, I cannot let slip: A brood of\r\nnightingales, who with their seuerall notes and tunes, with a strong\r\ndelightsome voyce, out of a weake body, will beare you company night and\r\nday. She loues (and liues in) hots of woods in her hart. She will helpe\r\nyou to cleanse your trees of caterpillars, and all noysome wormes and\r\nflyes. The gentle robin red-breast will helpe her, and in winter in the\r\ncoldest stormes will keepe a part. Neither will the silly wren be behind\r\nin summer, with her distinct whistle (like a sweete recorder) to cheere\r\nyour spirits.\r\n\r\n\"The black-bird and threstle (for I take it the thrush sings not, but\r\ndeuoures) sing loudly in a May morning, delights the eare much (and you\r\nneede not want their company, if you haue ripe cherries or berries, and\r\nwould as gladly as the rest do you pleasure:) But I had rather want\r\ntheir company than my fruit.\r\n\r\n\"What shall I say? A thousand of pleasant delightes are attendant in an\r\nOrchard: and sooner shall I be weary, than I can recken the least part\r\nof that pleasure, which one that hath and loues an Orchard, may find\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\n\"What is there of all these few that I haue reckoned, which doth not\r\nplease the eye, the eare, the smell, and taste? And by these sences as\r\norganes, pipes, and windowes, these delights are carried to refresh the\r\ngentle, generous, and noble mind.\r\n\r\n\"To conclude, what ioy may you haue, that you liuing to such an age,\r\nshall see the blessings of God on your labours while you liue, and\r\nleaue behind you to heires or successors (for God will make heires) such\r\na worke, that many ages after your death, shall record your loue to\r\ntheir countrey? And the rather, when you consider (chap. 14.) to what\r\nlength of time your worke is like to last.\"\r\n\r\nPage 30.--Having briefly glanced in this page at the delight with which\r\nSir H. Davy, Mr. Worlidge, and Mr. Whateley, viewed the flowers of\r\nspring, I can only add this reflection of Sturm:--\"If there were no\r\nstronger proofs on earth of the power, goodness, and wisdom of God, the\r\nflowers of spring alone, would be sufficient to convince us of it.\"\r\n\r\nPage 45.--The character of this modest and candid man, (Switzer), has\r\nfound an able advocate in the honest pen of Mr. Johnson, who, in p. 159\r\nof his History of Gardening, after noticing the acrimony of his\r\nopponents, observes, \"Neglect has pursued him beyond the grave, for his\r\nworks are seldom mentioned or quoted as authorities of the age he lived\r\nin. To me he appears to be the best author of his time; and if I was\r\ncalled upon to point out the classic authors of gardening, _Switzer_\r\nshould be one of the first on whom I would lay my finger. His works\r\nevidence him at once to have been a sound, practical horticulturist, a\r\nman well versed in the botanical science of the day, in its most\r\nenlarged sense.\" Mr. Johnson enumerates the distinct contents of each\r\nchapter in the Iconologia--the Kitchen Gardener--and the Fruit Gardener.\r\n\r\nPage 59.--The Tortworth Chesnut was growing previous to the Norman\r\nConquest. It fixes the boundary of a manor. Even in the reign of\r\nStephen, it was known as the great chesnut of Tortworth.\r\n\r\nPage 62.--The author of this treatise, who is a zealous orchardist, is\r\nlavish in his praise of a then discovered apple-tree and its produce,\r\n\"for the little cot-house to which it belongs, together with the little\r\nquillet in which it stands, being several years since mortgaged for ten\r\npounds, the fruit of this tree alone, in a course of some years, freed\r\nthe house and garden, and its more valuable self, from that burden.\" A\r\nneighbouring clergyman, too, was equally lavish, for he \"talked of it in\r\nall conversations,\" and such was his praise of it, that every one \"fell\r\nto admiration.\" Mr. Stafford is so pleased with this reverend\r\ngentleman's zeal, in extending the cultivation of this apple, (_the\r\nRoyal Wilding_) that he says, \"I could really wish, whenever the\r\noriginal tree decayeth, his statue carved out of the stump, by the most\r\nexpert hand, and overlaid with gold, may be erected near the public\r\nroad, in the place of it, at the common charge of the country.\" He\r\ncelebrates also another apple, which \"in a pleasant conversation was\r\nnamed by a gentleman _super-celestial_. Another gentleman, in allusion\r\nto _Pynes_, the name of my house, and to the common story of the West\r\nIndia pineapple, (which is said to be the finest fruit in the world, and\r\nto represent every exquisite flavour that is known), determined that it\r\nshould be called the _pyne-apple_; and by either of these names it is\r\ntalked of when pleasantry and conversation bring the remembrance of it\r\nto the table.\"\r\n\r\nPage 64.--It is but justice to Mr. Gibson to say, that in his Fruit\r\nGardener, he has entered fully into the merits of Le Genre's _Le maniere\r\nde cultiver les arbres fruitiers_; and that his pages are extremely\r\ninteresting. The great merits of Quintinye are also not overlooked.\r\n\r\nPage 84.--To the list of those deceased authors, whose portraits I have\r\nnot been able to discover, I must add the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN BRADDICK, Esq. A zealous horticulturist and fruit grower. He\r\ncontributed four papers to the Horticultural Society of London. In the\r\nGardener's Mag. for Jan. 1827, is a communication by him, on some new\r\nFrench pears. The editor of this magazine acknowledges \"the very liberal\r\nand truly patriotic manner in which our highly-valued correspondent\r\nshares every novelty he receives with those whose interest it is to\r\nincrease and disseminate such novelties.\" In the above magazine for\r\nMarch, 1827, is another spirited communication by him, on these new\r\npears, introduced from France, in which he says:--\"And here I think it\r\nnecessary to premise, that the following list is the cream skimmed off\r\nsome thousands of new pears, which I have for many years past been\r\ngetting together from various parts of the world, about two-thirds of\r\nwhich yet remain for trial, not having fruited, together with some\r\nthousands of seedling pears, apples, plums, cherries, apricots, peaches\r\nand grapes, of my own raising; the fruits of some of which I hope will\r\ncontinue to gladden the hearts of horticulturists for many years to\r\ncome. As they are produced I will make them known to the public, with as\r\nmuch facility as lies in my power.\r\n\r\n\"_Boughton Mount, July 29, 1826._\"\r\n\r\nOne is sorry to relate, that Mr. Braddick died soon after this\r\nbenevolent wish; for he died at the above seat of his, near Maidstone,\r\nin April, 1828, at the age of sixty-three.\r\n\r\nPage 120.--Dr. Dibdin thus speaks of Archibald Alison: \"The beautiful\r\nand melodious style of this writer, renders his works deserving of a\r\nconspicuous place in every well-chosen library.\"\r\n\r\nPage 89.--In this page I have stated that Dr. Dibdin says, \"on many\r\naccounts does G. Markham seem entitled to more notice and commendation.\"\r\nI have given extracts from his \"English Husbandman,\" to shew his love\r\nfor flowers. The same attachment is visible where he enumerates them in\r\nhis \"Country House-wive's Garden.\"--By the bye, though I have stated\r\nthis last work to be his, it surely appears to have been written by W.\r\nLawson. I merely now give the following extract from Markham's \"English\r\nHouse-Wife:\"\r\n\r\n\"Next vnto this sanctity and holinesse of life, it is meet that our\r\nEnglish hous-wife be a woman of great modesty and temperance as well\r\ninwardly as outwardly; inwardly, as in her behauiour and cariage towards\r\nher husband, wherein she shall shunne all violence of rage, passion, and\r\nhumour, coueting lesse to direct then to be directed, appearing euer\r\nvnto him pleasant, amiable, and delightfull, and though occasion,\r\nmishaps, or the misgouernement of his will may induce her to contrary\r\nthoughts, yet vertuously to suppresse them, and with a mild sufferance\r\nrather to call him home from his error, then with the strength of anger\r\nto abate the least sparke of his euill, calling in her mind that euill\r\nand vncomely language is deformed though vttered euen to seruants, but\r\nmost monstrous and vgly when it appeares before the presence of a\r\nhusband: outwardly, as in her apparrell and diet, both which she shall\r\nproportion according to the competency of her husband's estate and\r\ncalling, making her circle rather strait then large, for it is a rule if\r\nwe extend to the vttermost, we take away increase, if we goe a hayre\r\nbreadth beyond, we enter into consumption: but if we preserue any part,\r\nwe build strong forts against the aduersaries of fortune, prouided that\r\nsuch preseruation be honest and conscionable: for a lauish prodigality\r\nis brutish, so miserable couetuousnesse is hellish. Let therefore the\r\nhus-wives garments be comly and strong, made aswel to preserue the\r\nhealth, as adorne the person, altogether without toyish garnishes, or\r\nthe glosse of light colours, and as far from the vanity of new and\r\nfantastick fashions, as neere to the comly imitations of modest\r\nmatrons.\"\r\n\r\nI must give an extract from his \"Country Contentements,\" as he reminds\r\nus of Shakspeare's lines on the tuneable cry of hounds; for Markham\r\ndwells on their sweetness of cry--\"their deepe solemne mouthes--their\r\nroaring and loud ringing mouthes, which must beare the counter-tenor,\r\nthen some hollow plaine sweete mouthes--a deep-mouthed dog--a couple or\r\ntwo of small singing beagles, which as small trebles, may warble amongst\r\nthem: the cry will be a great deale the more sweeter--the hollow deepe\r\nmouth--the loud clanging mouthe--deepe flewed, such as for the most part\r\nyour _Shropshire_ and pure _Worcestershire_ dogs are--the louder and\r\npleasanter your cry will be, especially if it be in sounding tall woods,\r\nor under the echo of rocks--and not above one couple of roarers, which\r\nbeing heard but now and then, as at the opening or hitting of a scent,\r\nwill give much sweetnesse to the solemns, and gravenesse of the cry, and\r\nthe musick thereof will bee much more delightfull to the eares of every\r\nbeholder.\"\r\n\r\nPage 123.--The memory of Pope has perhaps never been more affectionately\r\nhonoured (nor that of Lord Mendip, who so zealously preserved every part\r\nof the house and garden at Twickenham) than in the glowing and tender\r\nlines of De Lille, in his poem of _Les Jardins_.\r\n\r\nThe vignette in my title-page, and that at page 84, are two of those\r\nneat decorations which so profusely embellish the Encyclopaedia of\r\nGardening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\n   Abercrombie, 153\r\n\r\n   Addison, xxviii., xxxii., 49, 115\r\n     ---- reflections on the tombs, 117\r\n\r\n   Age of gardeners and horticulturists, 81\r\n\r\n   Alison, Dr. xxxviii., 71, 120, 211\r\n\r\n   Anderson, 69, 175\r\n\r\n   Ardenne, J.

This is strongly exemplified in several bequests in her will;\r\nnot only in her bequest to Emma Sneyd, and in that to Mrs. Powys, but\r\nalso in the following:--\"The miniature picture of my late dear friend,\r\nMr. Saville, drawn in 1770, by the late celebrated artist Smart, and\r\nwhich at the time it was taken, and during many successive years, was an\r\nexact resemblance of the original, I bequeath to his daughter, Mrs.\r\nSmith, who I know will value and preserve it as a jewel above all prize;\r\nand in case of her previous demise, I bequeath the said precious\r\nminiature to her daughter, Mrs. Honora Jager, exhorting the said Honora\r\nJager, and her heirs, into whose hands soever it may fall, to guard it\r\nwith sacred care from the sun and from damp, as I have guarded it, that\r\nso the posterity of my valued friend may know what, in his prime, was\r\nthe form of him whose mind through life, by the acknowledgment of all\r\nwho knew him, and could discern the superior powers of talent and\r\nvirtue, was the seat of liberal endowment, warm piety, and energetic\r\nbenevolence.\"\r\n\r\nBeing thus on the subject of portraits, let me remark, that it is not\r\nalways that we meet with a faithful likeness. A review of Mad. de\r\nGenlis's _Petrarch et Laure_, justly observes, that \"it is doubtful if\r\nany of the portraits of _Petrarch_, which still remain, were painted\r\nduring his life-time. However that may be, it is impossible to trace in\r\nthem, either the elevation of his mind, the fire of his imagination, or\r\nthe pensive melancholy of his soul.\" In the Essays on Petrarch, by Ugo\r\nFoscolo, he informs us, that \"_Petrarch's_ person, if we trust his\r\nbiographers, was so striking with beauties, as to attract universal\r\nadmiration. They represent him with large and manly features, eyes full\r\nof fire, a blooming complexion, and a countenance that bespoke all the\r\ngenius and fancy that shone forth in his works.\" Do we yet know one\r\nreally good likeness of _Mary Queen of Scots_?\r\n\r\n[2] It has often struck me (perhaps erroneously), that the attachment\r\nwhich the great Sully evinced for gardens, even to the last period of\r\nhis long-protracted life, (eighty-two), _might_ in some degree have been\r\ncherished or increased from the writings of the great Lord Bacon. When\r\nthis illustrious duke retired to his country seats, wounded to the heart\r\nby the baseness of those who had flattered him when Henry was alive, his\r\nnoble and honest mind indulged in the embellishment of his gardens. I\r\nwill very briefly quote what history relates:--\"The life he led in his\r\nretreat at _Villebon_, was accompanied with grandeur and even majesty,\r\nsuch as might be expected from a character so grave and full of dignity\r\nas his. His table was served with taste and magnificence; he admitted to\r\nit none but the nobility in his neighbourhood, some of the principal\r\ngentlemen, and the ladies and maids of honour, who belonged to the\r\nduchess of Sully. He often went into his gardens, and passing through a\r\nlittle covered alley, which separated the flower from the kitchen\r\ngarden, ascended by a stone staircase (which the present duke of Sully\r\nhas caused to be destroyed), into a large walk of linden trees, upon a\r\nterrace on the other side of the garden. It was then the taste to have a\r\ngreat many narrow walks, very closely shaded with four or five rows of\r\ntrees, or palisadoes. Here he used to sit upon a settee painted green,\r\namused himself by beholding on the one side an agreeable landscape, and\r\non the other a second alley on a terrace extremely beautiful, which\r\nsurrounded a large piece of water, and terminated by a wood of lofty\r\ntrees. There was scarce one of his estates, those especially which had\r\ncastles on them, where he did not leave marks of his magnificence, to\r\nwhich he was chiefly incited by a principle of charity, and regard to\r\nthe public good. At _Rosny_, he raised that fine terrace, which runs\r\nalong the Seine, to a prodigious extent, and those great gardens, filled\r\nwith groves, arbours, and grottos, with water-works. He embellished\r\n_Sully_ with gardens, of which the plants were the finest in the world,\r\nand with a canal, supplied with fresh water by the little river Sangle,\r\nwhich he turned that way, and which is afterwards lost in the Loire. He\r\nerected a machine to convey the water to all the basons and fountains,\r\nof which the gardens are full. He enlarged the castle of _La Chapelle\r\nd'Angillon_, and embellished it with gardens and terraces.\"\r\n\r\nThese gardens somewhat remind one of these lines, quoted by Barnaby\r\nGooche:\r\n\r\n   _Have fountaines sweet at hand, or mossie waters,\r\n   Or pleasaunt brooke, that passing through the meads, is sweetly seene._\r\n\r\nThat fine gardens delighted Sully, is evident even from his own\r\nstatement of his visit to the Duke d'Aumale's, at Anet, near Ivry,\r\n(where Henry and Sully fought in that famous battle), for he says,--\"Joy\r\nanimated the countenance of Madame d'Aumale the moment she perceived me.\r\nShe gave me a most kind and friendly reception, took me by the hand, and\r\nled me through those fine galleries and beautiful gardens, which make\r\nAnet a most enchanting place.\" One may justly apply to Sully, what he\r\nhimself applies to the Bishop of Evreaux: \"A man for whom eloquence and\r\ngreat sentiments had powerful charms.\"\r\n\r\nI had designed some few years ago, to have published a Review of some of\r\nthe superb Gardens in France, during the reign of Henry IV. and during\r\nthe succeeding reigns, till the demise of Louis XV., embellished with\r\nplates of some of the costly and magnificent decorations of those times;\r\nwith extracts from such of their eminent writers whose letters or works\r\nmay have occasionally dwelt on gardens.--My motto, for want of a better,\r\nmight have been these two lines from Rapin,\r\n\r\n   _----France, in all her rural pomp appears\r\n   With numerous gardens stored._\r\n\r\nPerhaps I might have been so greedy and insolent, as to have presumed to\r\nhave monopolized our Shakspeare's line,--\"I love _France_ so well, that\r\nI will not part with a village of it; I will have it all mine.\"\r\n\r\nIsaac Walton gives the following lines from a translation of a German\r\npoet, which makes one equally fond of England:\r\n\r\n   We saw so many woods, and princely bowers,\r\n   Sweet fields, brave palaces, and stately towers,\r\n   _So many gardens dress'd with curious care_,\r\n   That Thames with royal Tiber may compare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] The Encyclopaedia of Gardening has a rich page (35) devoted to Le\r\nNotre. The Nouveau Dict. Hist. thus records his genius and his grand and\r\nmagnificent efforts:--\"Ce grand homme fut choisi pour decorer les\r\njardins du chateau de Vau-le-Vicomte. Il en fit un sejour enchanteur,\r\npar les ornamens nouveaux, pleins de magnificence, qu'il y prodigua. On\r\nvit alors, pour la premiere fois, des portiques, des berceaux, des\r\ngrottes, des traillages, des labyrinths, &c. embellir varier le\r\nspectacle des jardins. Le Roi, temoin des ces merveilles, lui donna la\r\ndirection de tous ses parcs. Il embellit par son art, Versailles,\r\nTrianon, et il fit a St. Germain cette fameuse terrasse qu'on voit\r\ntoujours avec une nouvelle admiration. Les jardins de Clagny, de\r\nChantilly, de St. Cloud, de Meudon, de Sceaux, le parterre du Tibre, et\r\nles canaux qui ornent ce lieu champetre a Fontainbleau, sont encore son\r\nouvrage. Il demanda a faire voyage de l'Italie, dans l'esperance\r\nd'acquerir de nouvelles connoissances; mais son genie createur l'avoit\r\nconduit a la perfection. Il ne vit rien de comparable a ce qu'il avoit\r\nfait en France.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the above just and high tribute, I have no hesitation in\r\nsaying, that it is not superior to the magic picture which the\r\nfascinating pen of Mad. de Sevigne has drawn of le Notre's creative\r\ngenius, in her letter of Aug. 7, 1675. Many others of this charming\r\nwoman's letters breathe her love of gardens.\r\n\r\n[4] The Nouveau Dict. Hist. thus speaks of the Pere Rapin:--\"A un genie\r\nheureux, a un gout sur, il joignoit une probite exacte, un coeur droit,\r\nun caractere aimable et des moeurs douces. Il etoit naturellement\r\nhonnete, et il s'etoit encore poli dans le commerce des grands. Parmi\r\nses differentes Poesies Latines, on distingue le Poeme des Jardins.\r\nC'est son chef d'oeuvre; il est digne du siecle d'Auguste, dit l'Abbe\r\nDes Fontaines, pour l'elegance et la purete du langage, pour l'esprit et\r\nles graces qui y regnent.\" Among the letters of Rabutin de Bussy, are\r\nmany most interesting ones from this worthy father.\r\n\r\n[5] \"Rien n'est plus admirable que la peinture naive que la Pere Vaniere\r\nfait des amusemens champetres; on est egalement enchante de la richesse\r\net de la vivacite de son imagination, de l'eclat et de l'harmonie de sa\r\npoesie, du choix de la purete de ses expressions. Il mourut a Toulouse\r\nen 1739, et plusiers poetes ornerent de fleurs son tombeau.\"--Nouv.\r\nDict. Hist.\r\n\r\n[6] La Comtesse de la Riviere, thus alludes to this convent: \"Madame de\r\nSevigne a pour ce monastere une veneration qui est audela de toute\r\nexpression; elle assure qu'on n'approche pas de ce lieu sans sentir au\r\ndedans de soi une onction divine.\"\r\n\r\n[7] The late Sir U. Price, pays a very high compliment to this exquisite\r\npoem, in p. 31, vol. i. of his Essays, terming it full of the justest\r\ntaste, and most brilliant imagery.\r\n\r\n[8] In the Earl of Harcourt's garden, at Nuneham, in Oxfordshire, (laid\r\nout in some parts under the eye and fine taste of the poet Mason), on a\r\nbust of Rousseau are these lines:\r\n\r\n   Say, is thy honest heart to virtue warm?\r\n     Can genius animate thy feeling breast?\r\n   Approach, behold this venerable form;\r\n     'Tis Rousseau! let thy bosom speak the rest.\r\n\r\nThere are attractive pages in this little volume of the Viscount's,\r\nwhich would have interested either Shenstone, or Gainsborough,\r\nparticularly the pages 59, 143, 145, and 146, (of Mr. Malthus's\r\ntranslation), for in these pages \"we feel all the truth and energy of\r\nnature.\" A short extract from p. 131, will enable the reader to judge of\r\nthe writer's style:--\"When the cool evening sheds her soft and\r\ndelightful tints, and leads on the hours of pleasure and repose, then is\r\nthe universal reign of sublime harmony. It is at this happy moment that\r\nClaude has caught the tender colouring, the enchanting calm, which\r\nequally attaches the heart and the eyes; it is then that the fancy\r\nwanders with tranquillity over distant scenes. Masses of trees through\r\nwhich the light penetrates, and under whose foliage winds a pleasant\r\npath; meadows, whose mild verdure is still softened by the transparent\r\nshades of the evening; crystal waters which reflect all the near objects\r\nin their pure surface; mellow tints, and distances of blue vapour; such\r\nare in general the objects best suited to a western exposure. The sun,\r\nbefore he leaves the horizon, seems to blend earth and sky, and it is\r\nfrom sky that evening views receive their greatest beauty. The\r\nimagination dwells with delight upon the exquisite variety of soft and\r\npleasing colours, which embellishes the clouds and the distant country,\r\nin this peaceful hour of enjoyment and contemplation.\"\r\n\r\n[9] He was enthusiastically devoted to the cultivation of his gardens,\r\nwhich exhibited enchanting scenery, umbrageous walks, and magnificent\r\nwater-falls. When thus breathing the pure air of rural life, the\r\nblood-stained monsters of 1793 seized him in his garden, and led him to\r\nthe scaffold. \"He heard unmoved his own sentence, but the condemnation\r\nof his daughter and grand-daughter, tore his heart: the thought of\r\nseeing two weak and helpless creatures perish, shook his fortitude.\r\nBeing taken back to the _Conciergerie_, his courage returned, and he\r\nexhorted his children to prepare for death. When the fatal bell rung, he\r\nrecovered all his wonted cheerfulness; having paid to nature the tribute\r\nof feeling, he desired to give his children an example of magnanimity;\r\nhis looks exhibited the sublime serenity of virtue, and taught them to\r\nview death undismayed. When he ascended the cart, he conversed with his\r\nchildren, unaffected by the clamours of the ferocious populace; and on\r\narriving at the foot of the scaffold, took a last and solemn farewell of\r\nhis children; immediately after he was dismissed into eternity.\"\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott, after noticing \"the wild and squalid features\" of\r\nMarat, who \"lay concealed in some obscure garret or cellar, among his\r\ncut-throats, until a storm appeared, when, like a bird of ill omen, his\r\ndeath-screech was again heard,\" thus states the death of another of the\r\nmurderers of the Malherbes:--\"Robespierre, in an unsuccessful attempt to\r\nshoot himself, had only inflicted a horrible _fracture on his\r\nunder-jaw_. In this situation they were found like wolves in their lair,\r\nfoul with blood, mutilated, despairing, and yet not able to die.\r\nRobespierre lay on a table in an anti-room, his head supported by a deal\r\nbox, and his hideous countenance half-hidden by a bloody and dirty cloth\r\nbound round his shattered chin. As the fatal cars passed to the\r\nguillotine, those who filled them, but especially Robespierre, were\r\noverwhelmed with execrations. The nature of his previous wound, from\r\nwhich the cloth had never been removed till the executioner _tore_ it\r\noff, added to the torture of the sufferer. The shattered jaw dropped,\r\nand the wretch yelled aloud, to the horror of the spectators. A mask\r\ntaken from that dreadful head was long exhibited in different nations of\r\nEurope, and appalled the spectator by its ugliness, and the mixture of\r\nfiendish expression with that of bodily agony.\"\r\n\r\nMons. Malherbes loved to relate an answer made to him by a common\r\nfellow, during his stay at Paris, when he was obliged to go four times\r\nevery day to the prison of the Temple, to attend the king: his extreme\r\nage did not allow him to walk, and he was compelled to take a carriage.\r\nOne day, particularly, when the weather was intensely severe, he\r\nperceived, on coming out of the vehicle, that the driver was benumbed\r\nwith cold. \"My friend,\" said Malherbes to him, in his naturally tender\r\nmanner, \"you must be penetrated by the cold, and I am really sorry to\r\ntake you abroad in this bitter season.\"--\"That's nothing, M. de\r\nMalherbes; in such a cause as this, I'd travel to the world's end\r\nwithout complaining.\"--\"Yes, but your poor horses could not.\"--\"Sir,\"\r\nreplied the honest coachman, \"_my horses think as I do_.\"\r\n\r\n[10] I cannot pass by the name of Henry, without the recollection of\r\nwhat an historian says of him: \"L'Abbe Langlet du Fresnoy a publie\r\ncinquante-neuf lettres de a bon Roi, dans sa nouvelle edition du Journal\r\nde Henry III. on y remarque du feu de l'esprit, de l'imagination, et\r\nsur-tout cette eloquence du coeur, qui plait tout dans un monarque.--On\r\nl'exortoit a traiter avec rigueur quelques places de la Ligue, qu'il\r\navoit redites par la force: _La satisfaction qu'on tire de la vengeance\r\nne dure qu'un moment_ (repondit ce prince genereuse) _mais celle qu'on\r\ntire de la clemence est eternelle_. Plus on connoitre Henri, plus on\r\nl'aimera, plus on l'admiriroet.\"\r\n\r\n[11] The king, knowing his fine taste for sculpture and painting, sent\r\nhim to Italy, and the Nouv. Dict. Hist. gives this anecdote: \"La Pape\r\ninstruit de son merite, voulut le voir, et lui donna une assez longue\r\naudience, sur la fin de laquelle le Notre s'ecria en s'adressant au\r\nPape: J'ai vu les plus grands hommes du monde, Votre Saintete, et le Roi\r\nmon maitre. Il y a grande difference, dit le Pape; le Roi est un grand\r\nprince victorieux, je suis un pauvre pretre serviteur des serviteurs de\r\nDieu. Le Notre, charme de cette reponse, oublia qui la lui faisoit, et\r\nfrappant sur l'epaule du Pape lui repondit a son tour: Mon Reverend\r\nPere, vous vous portez bien et vous enterrerez tout la Sacre College. Le\r\nPape, qui entendoit le Francois, rit du pronostic. Le Notre, charme de\r\nplus en plus de sa bonte, et de l'estime particuliere qu'il temoignoit\r\npour le Roi, se jeta au cou du Pape et l'embrassa. C'etoit au reste sa\r\ncoutume d'embrasser tous ceux qui publioient les louanges de Louis XIV.,\r\net il embrassoit le Roi lui-meme, toutes les fois que ce prince revenoit\r\nde la campagne.\"\r\n\r\n[12] I will conclude by mentioning a justly celebrated man, who, it\r\nseems was not over fond of his garden, though warmly attached both to\r\nBoileau, and to Mad. de Sevigne,--I mean that most eloquent preacher\r\nBossuet, of whom a biographer, after stating that he was so absorbed in\r\nthe study of the ancient fathers of the church, \"qu'il ne se permettoit\r\nque des delassemens fort courts. Il ne se promenoit que rarement meme\r\ndans son jardin. Son jardinier lui dit un jour: _Si je plantois des\r\nSaint Augustins, et des Saint Chrysostomes, vous les viendriez voir;\r\nmais pour vos arbres, vous ne vous en souciez guere_.\"\r\n\r\n[13] Mr. Worlidge, who wrote during part of the reigns of Charles II.\r\nand James II. judiciously observes, that \"the glory of the French\r\npalaces, often represented to our English eyes in sculpture, are adorned\r\n_with their beauteous gardens before them_; which wanting, they would\r\nseem without lustre or grandeur.\"\r\n\r\n[14] He was fined L30,000 for having taken a favourite of the king's, in\r\nthe very presence chamber, by the nose, for having insulted him, and\r\nafterwards dragging him out of the room.\r\n\r\n[15] It was to this nobleman, that Addison addressed his elegant and\r\nsublime epistle, after he had surveyed with the eyes and genius of a\r\nclassical poet, the monuments and heroic deeds of ancient Rome.\r\n\r\n[16] Lord Chesterfield thus speaks of this distinguished man:--\"His\r\nprivate life was stained by no vices, nor sullied by any meanness. His\r\neloquence was of every kind; but his invectives were terrible, and\r\nuttered with such energy of diction and countenance, that he intimidated\r\nthose who were the most willing and the best able to encounter him.\" Sir\r\nW. Chatham Trelawney used to observe of him, that it was impossible for\r\nthe members of the side opposed to him in the House of Commons to look\r\nhim in the face when he was warmed in debate: he seemed to bid them all\r\na haughty defiance. \"For my own part,\" said Trelawney, \"I never dared\r\ncast my eyes towards his, for if I did, _they nailed me to the floor_.\"\r\n\r\nSmollet says, that he displayed \"such irresistible energy of argument,\r\nand such power of elocution, as struck his hearers with astonishment and\r\nadmiration. It flashed like the lightning of heaven against the\r\nministers and sons of corruption, blasting where it smote, and withering\r\nthe nerves of opposition; but his more substantial praise was founded\r\nupon his disinterested integrity, his incorruptible heart, his\r\nunconquerable spirit of independance, and his invariable attachment to\r\nthe interest and liberty of his country.\" Another biographer thus\r\nmentions him:--\"His elevated aspect commanded the awe and mute attention\r\nof all who beheld him, whilst a certain grace in his manner, conscious\r\nof all the dignities of his situation, of the solemn scene he acted in,\r\nas well as his own exalted character, seemed to acknowledge and repay\r\nthe respect he received; his venerable form, bowed with infirmity and\r\nage, but animated by a mind which nothing could subdue; his spirit\r\nshining through him, arming his eye with lightning, and cloathing his\r\nlips with thunder; or, if milder topics offered, harmonizing his\r\ncountenance in smiles, and his voice in softness, for the compass of his\r\npowers was infinite. As no idea was too vast, no imagination too\r\nsublime, for the grandeur and majesty of his manner; so no fancy was too\r\nplayful, nor any allusion too comic, for the ease and gaiety with which\r\nhe could accommodate to the occasion. But the character of his oratory\r\nwas dignity; this presided in every respect, even to his sallies of\r\npleasantry.\"\r\n\r\n[17] Sir Walter Scott's attachment to gardens, breaks out even in his\r\nLife of Swift, where his fond enquiries have discovered the sequestered\r\nand romantic garden of _Vanessa_, at Marley Abbey.\r\n\r\n[18] So thought Sir W. Raleigh;\r\n\r\n   Sweet violets, love's paradise, that spread\r\n     Your gracious odours ...\r\n   Upon the gentle wing of some calm-breathing wind,\r\n       That plays amidst the plain.\r\n\r\nThe lines in Twelfth Night we all recollect:\r\n\r\n   That strain again;--it had a dying fall:\r\n   O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet south\r\n   That breathes upon a bank of _violets_,\r\n   Stealing and giving odour.\r\n\r\nThat these flowers were the most favourite ones of Shakspeare, there can\r\nbe little doubt--Perditta fondly calls them\r\n\r\n   ----sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes\r\n   Or Cytherea's breath.\r\n\r\nWhen Petrarch first saw Laura: \"elle avail une robe verte, sa coleur\r\nfavorite, parsemee de _violettes_, la plus humble des fleurs.\"--Childe\r\nHarold thus paints this flower:\r\n\r\n   The sweetness of the violet's deep blue eyes\r\n   (Kiss'd by the breath of heaven) seems colour'd by its skies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[19] One almost fancies one perceives Lord Bacon's attachment to\r\ngardens, or to rural affairs, even in the speech he made before the\r\nnobility, when first taking his seat in the High Court of Chancery; he\r\nhoped \"that these same _brambles_ that _grow_ about justice, of needless\r\ncharge and expence, and all manner of exactions, might be rooted out;\"\r\nadding also, that immediate and \"_fresh_ justice was the _sweetest_.\"\r\nMr. Mason, in a note to his English Garden, after paying a high\r\ncompliment to Lord Bacon's picturesque idea of a garden, thus concludes\r\nthat note:--\"Such, when he descended to matters of more elegance (for,\r\nwhen we speak of Lord Bacon, to treat of these was to descend,) were the\r\namazing powers of this universal genius.\"\r\n\r\n[20] Mr. Pope's delight in gardens, is visible even in the condensed\r\nallusion he makes to them, in a letter to Mr. Digby; \"I have been above\r\na month strolling about in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, from garden\r\nto garden, but still returning to Lord Cobham's, with fresh\r\nsatisfaction. I should be sorry to see my Lady Scudamore's, till it has\r\nhad the full advantage of Lord Bathurst's improvements.\"\r\n\r\n[21] A biographer thus speaks of the Prince de Ligne: \"Quand les rois se\r\nreunirent a Vienne en 1814, ils se firent tous un devoir de l'accuellier\r\navec distinction, et furent enchante de la vivacite de son esprit, et de\r\nson intarissable gaiete, qui malgre ses infirmites et son grand age, ne\r\nl'avoit pasencore abandonne. Ses saillies, et ses bon mots etoient comme\r\nautrefois repetes pour tous.\" His generous heart thus speaks of the\r\nabused and unfortunate Marie Antoinette:--\"The breath of calumny has not\r\neven respected the memory of the loveliest and best of women, of whose\r\nspotless heart and irreproachable conduct, no one can bear stronger\r\nevidence than I. Her soul was as pure as her face was fair; yet neither\r\nvirtue nor beauty could save the victim of sanguinary liberty.\" In\r\nrelating this (says his biographer), his voice faultered, and his eyes\r\nwere suffused with tears. He thus briefly states, with his usual humour\r\nand vivacity, his conversation with Voltaire as to the garden at Ferney:\r\n\r\n_P. de L._--Monsieur, Monsieur, cela doit vous coupe beaucoup, quel\r\ncharmant jardin!\r\n\r\n_Volt._--Oh! mon jardinier est un bete: c'est moi meme qui ait fait\r\ntout.\r\n\r\n_P. de L._--Je le croi.\r\n\r\n[22] Monsieur Thomas, in his eulogy of Descartes says, it should have\r\nbeen pronounced at the foot of Newton's statue: or rather, Newton\r\nhimself should have been his panegyrist. Of this eulogy, Voltaire, in a\r\nmost handsome letter to Mons. Thomas, thus speaks:--\"votre ouvrage\r\nm'enchante d'un bout a l'autre, et Je vais le relire des que J'aurai\r\ndicte ma lettre.\" The sleep and expanding of flowers are most\r\ninterestingly reviewed by Mr. Loudon in p. 187 of his Encyclop., and by\r\nM. V. H. de Thury, in the above discourse, a few pages preceding his\r\nseducing description of the magnificent garden of M. de Boursault.\r\n\r\nSo late ago as the year 1804 it was proposed at Avignon, to erect an\r\nobelisk in memory of Petrarch, at Vaucluse: \"il a ete decide, qu'on\r\nl'elevera, vis-avis _l'ancien jardin_ de Petrache, lieu ou le lit de\r\nsorgue forme un angle.\"\r\n\r\n[23] This garden (as Mr. Walpole observes) was planted by the poet,\r\nenriched by him with the fairy gift of eternal summer.\r\n\r\n[24] Mr. Pope thus mentions the vines round this cave:--\r\n\r\n   Depending vines the shelving cavern skreen,\r\n   With purple clusters blushing through the green.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[25] Nearly eight pages of Mr. Loudon's Encyclop. are devoted to a very\r\ninteresting research on the gardens of the Romans. Sir Joseph Banks has\r\na paper on the Forcing Houses of the Romans, with a list of Fruits\r\ncultivated by them, now in our gardens, in vol. 1 of the _Hort. Trans._\r\n\r\n[26] Dr. Pulteney gives a list of several manuscripts in the Bodleian\r\nLibrary, the writers of which are unknown, and the dates not precisely\r\ndetermined, but supposed to have been written, if not prior to the\r\ninvention of printing, at least before the introduction of that art into\r\nEngland. I select the two following.--\r\n\r\nNo. 2543. De Arboribus, Aromatis, et _Floribus_.\r\n\r\nNo. 2562. Glossarium Latino-anglicum Arborum, _Fructuum_, Frugam, &c.\r\n\r\nAnd he states the following from Bib. S. Petri Cant:--\r\n\r\nNo. 1695. Notabilia de Vegetabilibus, et Plantis.\r\n\r\nDr. Pulteney observes, that the above list might have been considerably\r\nextended, but that it would have unnecessarily swelled the article he\r\nwas then writing.\r\n\r\nThe Nouv. Dict. Hist. mentions a personage whose attachment to his\r\ngarden, and one of whose motives for cultivating that garden, does not\r\ndeserve a notice:--\"Attale III. Roi de Pergame, fils de Stratonice,\r\nsoulla la throne en repandant le sang de ses amis et de sea parens. Il\r\nabandonna ensuite le soin de ses affaires _pour s'occuper entirement de\r\nson jardin_. Il y cultivoit des poisons, tels que l'aconit et la cigue,\r\nqu'il envoyoit quelque fois en present a ses amis. Il mourut 133 ans\r\navant Jesus Christ.\"\r\n\r\n[27] To have completed the various contrasting vicissitudes of this poor\r\n_Suffolk_ farmer's life, he should have added to his other employments,\r\nthose of another _Suffolk_ man, the late W. Lomax, who had been\r\n_grave-digger_ at the pleasant town of Bury St. Edmund's, for thirty-six\r\nyears, and who, also, for a longer period than thirty-six years, had\r\nbeen a _morrice-dancer_ at all the elections for that borough.\r\n\r\n[28] Gerarde, speaking of good sorts of apples and pears, thus mentions\r\nthe above named _Pointer_:--\"Master Richard Pointer has them all growing\r\nin his ground at Twickenham, near London, who is a most cunning and\r\ncurious grafter and planter of all manner of rare fruits; and also in\r\nthe ground of an excellent grafter and painful planter, Master Henry\r\nBunbury, of Touthil-street, near unto Westminster; and likewise in the\r\nground of a diligent and most affectionate lover of plants, Master\r\nWarner, neere Horsely Down, by London; and in divers other grounds about\r\nLondon.\"\r\n\r\n[29] The fate of this poor man reminds one of what is related of\r\nCorregio:--\"He received from the mean canons of Parma, for his\r\nAssumption of the Virgin, the small pittance of two hundred livres, and\r\nit was paid him in copper. He hastened with the money to his starving\r\nfamily; but as he had six or eight miles to travel from Parma, the\r\nweight of his burden, and the heat of the climate, added to the\r\noppression of his breaking heart, a pleurisy attacked him, which, in\r\nthree days, terminated his existence and his sorrows in his fortieth\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\nIf one could discover a portrait of either of the authors mentioned in\r\nthe foregoing list, one might, I think, inscribe under each of such\r\nportraits, these verses:\r\n\r\n   Ce pourtrait et maint liure\r\n   Par le peintre et l'escrit,\r\n   Feront reuoir et viure\r\n   Ta face et ton esprit.\r\n\r\nThey are inscribed under an ancient portrait, done in 1555, which Mr.\r\nDibdin has preserved in his account of Caen, and which he thus\r\nintroduces: \"As we love to be made acquainted with the _persons_ of\r\nthose from whom we have received instruction and pleasure, so take,\r\ngentle reader, a representation of Bourgueville.\"\r\n\r\n[30] \"Mr. John Parkinson, an apothecary of this city, (yet living, and\r\nlabouring for the common good,) in the year 1629, set forth a work by\r\nthe name of _Paradisus Terrestris_, wherein he gives the figures of all\r\nsuch plants as are preserved in gardens, for the beauty of their\r\nflowers, in use in meats or sauces; and also an orchard for all trees\r\nbearing fruit, and such shrubs as for their beauty are kept in orchards\r\nand gardens, with the ordering, planting, and preserving of all these.\r\nIn this work he hath not superficially handled these things, but\r\naccurately descended to the very varieties in each species, wherefore I\r\nhave now and then referred my reader, addicted to these delights, to\r\nthis work, especially in flowers and fruits, wherein I was loth to spend\r\ntoo much time, especially seeing I could adde nothing to what he had\r\ndone upon that subject before.\"\r\n\r\n[31] \"Mr. Hartlib (says Worlidge) tells you of the benefits of _orchard\r\nfruits_, that they afford curious walks for pleasure, food for cattle in\r\nthe spring, summer, and winter, (meaning under their shadow,) fewel for\r\nthe fire, shade for the heat, physick for the sick, refreshment for the\r\nsound, plenty of food for man, and that not of the worst, and drink also\r\nof the best.\"\r\n\r\nMilton also in the above Tractate thus speaks:--\"In those vernal seasons\r\nof the year, when the air is calm and pleasant, it were an injury and\r\nsullenness against nature, not to go out and see her riches, and partake\r\nin her rejoicing with heaven and earth.\"\r\n\r\n[32] In the above tract of Dr. Beale's, he thus breaks out in praise of\r\nthe Orchards of this _deep and rich_ county:--\"From the greatest person\r\nto the poorest cottager, all habitations are encompassed with orchards,\r\nand gardens, and in most places our hedges are enriched with rows of\r\nfruit trees, pears or apples. All our villages, and generally all our\r\nhighways, (all our vales being thick set with rows of villages), are in\r\nthe spring time sweetened and beautified with the blossomed trees, which\r\ncontinue their changeable varieties of ornament, till (in the end of\r\nautumn), they fill our garners with pleasant fruit, and our cellars with\r\nrich and winy liquors. Orchards, being the pride of our county, do not\r\nonly sweeten, but also purify the ambient air, which I conceive to\r\nconduce very much to the constant health and long lives for which our\r\ncounty hath always been famous. We do commonly devise a shadowy walk\r\nfrom our gardens, through our orchards (which is the richest, sweetest,\r\nand most embellished grove) into our coppice woods, or timber woods.\"\r\nDr. Beale does not praise the whole of their land. He describes some as\r\n\"starvy, chapt, and cheany, as the basest land upon the Welch\r\nmountains.\" He makes amends, however, for this, for he describes the\r\nnags bred on their high grounds, as very different from our present\r\nhackney-coach horses; they \"are airey and sinewy, full of spirits and\r\nvigour, in shape like the _barbe_, they rid ground, and gather courage\r\nand delight in their own speed.\"\r\n\r\n[33] A Lady Gerard is mentioned in two letters of Mr. Pope, to W.\r\nFortescue, Esq. They have no date to them. They appear in Polwhele's\r\nHistory of Devonshire. \"I have just received a note from Mrs. Blount,\r\nthat she and Lady Gerard will dine here to-day.\" And \"Lady Gerard was to\r\nsee Chiswick Gardens (as I imagined) and therefore forced to go from\r\nhence by five; it was a mortification to Mrs. Blount to go, when there\r\nwas a hope of seeing you and Mr. Fortescue.\" There are three more\r\nletters, without date, to Martha Blount, written from the Wells at\r\nBristol, and from Stowe, in which Pope says, \"I have no more room but to\r\ngive Lady Gerard my hearty services.\" And \"once more my services to Lady\r\nGerard.\" \"I desire you will write a post-letter to my man John, at what\r\ntime you would have the pine apples, to send to Lady Gerard.\" Probably\r\nMartha Blount's Lady Gerard was a descendant of Rea's.\r\n\r\n[34] A most curious account of the _Tulipomania_, or rage for tulips,\r\nformerly in Holland, may be seen in Phillips's Flora Historica.\r\n\r\n[35] Perhaps no one more truly painted rich pastoral scenes than Isaac\r\nWalton. This occurs in many, many pages of his delightful _Angler_. The\r\nlate ardently gifted, and most justly lamented Sir Humphry Davy too, in\r\nhis _Salmonia_, has fondly caught the charms of Walton's pages. His pen\r\nriots in the wild, the beautiful, the sweet, delicious scenery of\r\nnature:--\"how delightful in the early spring, to wander forth by some\r\nclear stream, to see the leaf bursting from the purple bud, to scent the\r\nodours of the bank, perfumed by the violet, and enamelled as it were\r\nwith the primrose, and the daisy; to wander upon the fresh turf below\r\nthe shade of trees, whose bright blossoms are filled with the music of\r\nthe bee.\" Mr. Worlidge, in his Systema Agriculturae, says, that the\r\ndelights in angling \"rouzes up the ingenious early in the spring\r\nmornings, that they have the benefit of the sweet and pleasant morning\r\nair, which many through sluggishness enjoy not; so that health (the\r\ngreatest treasure that mortals enjoy) and pleasure, go hand in hand in\r\nthis exercise. What can be more said of it, than that the most\r\ningenious, most use it.\" Mr. Whately, in his usual charming style, thus\r\npaints the spring:--\"Whatever tends to animate the scene, accords with\r\nthe season, which is full of youth and vigour, fresh and sprightly,\r\nbrightened by the verdure of the herbage, and the woods, gay with\r\nblossoms, and flowers, and enlivened by the songs of the birds in all\r\ntheir variety, from the rude joy of the skylark, to the delicacy of the\r\nnightingale.\"\r\n\r\n[36] Tusser seems somewhat of Meager's opinion:--\r\n\r\n   Sow peason and beans, in the wane of the moon,\r\n   Who soweth them sooner, he soweth too soon;\r\n   That they with the planet may rest and arise,\r\n   And flourish, with bearing most plentifull wise.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Quintinye says, \"I solemnly declare, that after a\r\ndiligent observation of the moon's changes for thirty years together,\r\nand an enquiry whether they had any influence in gardening, the\r\naffirmative of which has been so long established among us, I perceive\r\nit was no weightier than old wives' tales.\"\r\n\r\nThe moon (says Mr. Mavor) having an influence on the tides and the\r\nweather, she was formerly supposed to extend her power over all nature.\r\n\r\nThere is a treatise, by _Claude Gadrois_, on the _Influences des\r\nAstres_. Surely this merits perusal, when the Nouv. Dict. Hist. thus\r\nspeaks of him:--\"Il etoit ami du celebre Arnauld et meritoit de l'etre\r\npar _la justesse de son esprit_ et la purete de ses moeurs, par la bonte\r\nde son caractere et par la droiture de son coeur.\"\r\n\r\nThe following wise experiment occurs in an ancient book on husbandry;\r\nbut if the two parties there mentioned had lived with Leonard Meager,\r\none must not do him the injustice of supposing he would have been a\r\nconvert to their opinion:--\"_Archibius_ is said to have written (or sent\r\nword most likely) to _Antiochus_, king of _Syria_, that if you bury a\r\nspeckled toad inclosed in an earthen pot, in the middle of your garden,\r\nthe same will be defended from all hurtful weather and tempests.\"\r\nMeager, however, is kept in countenance by Mr. Worlidge, who, in his\r\nchapter of Prognostics, at the end of his interesting Systemae\r\nAgriculturae, actually states that\r\n\r\nIf dog's guts rumble and make a noise, it presageth rain or snow.\r\n\r\nThe cat, by washing her face, and putting her foot over her ear,\r\nforeshews rain.\r\n\r\nThe squeaking and skipping up and down of mice and rats, portend rain.\r\n\r\nLeonard Meager thus notices a nurseryman of his day:--\"Here follows a\r\ncatalogue of divers sorts of fruits, which I had of my very loving\r\nfriend, Captain Garrle, dwelling at the great nursery between\r\nSpittlefields and Whitechapel; a very eminent and ingenious nurseryman.\"\r\nPerhaps this is the same nurseryman that Rea, in his _Pomona_, mentions.\r\nHe says (after naming some excellent pear-trees) \"they may be had out of\r\nthe nurseries about London, especially those of Mr. Daniel Stepping, and\r\nMr. Leonard _Girle_, who will faithfully furnish such as desire these,\r\nor any other kinds of rare fruit-trees, of whose fidelity in the\r\ndelivery of right kinds, I have had long experience in divers\r\nparticulars, a virtue not common to men of that profession.\" At this\r\nperiod, the space between Spittlefields and Whitechapel, must have\r\nconsisted of gardens, and perhaps superb country houses. The Earl of\r\nDevonshire had a fine house and garden near Petticoat-lane. Sir W.\r\nRaleigh had one near Mile-end. Some one (I forget the author) says, \"On\r\nboth sides of this lane (Petticoat-lane) were anciently hedges and rows\r\nof elm trees, and the pleasantness of the neighbouring fields induced\r\nseveral gentlemen to build their houses here; among whom was the Spanish\r\nAmbassador, whom Strype supposes was Gondamour.\" Gondamour was the\r\nperson to please whom (or rather that James might the more easily marry\r\nhis son Charles to one of the daughters of Spain, with her immense\r\nfortune) this weak monarch was urged to sacrifice the life of Raleigh.\r\n\r\nWithin one's own memory, it is painful to reflect, on the many pleasant\r\nfields, neat paddocks, rural walks, and gardens, (breathing pure air)\r\nthat surrounded this metropolis for miles, and miles, and which are now\r\nill exchanged for an immense number of new streets, many of them the\r\nreceptacles only of smoke and unhealthiness.\r\n\r\n[37] These lines are from him, at whose death (says Sir W. Scott in his\r\ngenerous and glowing eulogy) we were stunned \"by one of those\r\ndeath-notes which are peeled at intervals, as from an archangel's\r\ntrumpet\"--they are from \"that mighty genius which walked amongst men as\r\nsomething superior to ordinary mortality, and whose powers were beheld\r\nwith wonder, and something approaching to terror, as if we knew not\r\nwhether they were of good or evil\"--they are from \"that noble tree which\r\nwill never more bear fruit, or blossom! which has been cut down in its\r\nstrength, and the past is all that remains to us of Byron: whose\r\nexcellences will _now_ be universally acknowledged, and his faults (let\r\nus hope and believe) not remembered in his epitaph.\" His \"deep\r\ntransported mind\" (to apply Milton's words to him) thus continues his\r\nmoralization:--\r\n\r\n   What are the hopes of man? old Egypt's king\r\n     CHEOPS, erected the first pyramid,\r\n   And largest; thinking it was just the thing\r\n     To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   But somebody or other rummaging,\r\n     Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:\r\n   Let not a monument give you, or me, hopes,\r\n   Since not a pinch of dust remains of CHEOPS.\r\n\r\nThe Quarterly Review, in reviewing Light's Travels, observes, that\r\n\"Cheops employed three hundred and sixty thousand of his subjects for\r\ntwenty years in raising this pyramid, or pile of stones, equal in weight\r\nto six millions of tons; and to render his precious dust more secure,\r\nthe narrow chamber was made accessible only by small intricate passages,\r\nobstructed by stones of an enormous weight, and so carefully closed,\r\nexternally, as not to be perceptible. Yet how vain are all the\r\nprecautions of man! Not a bone was left of Cheops, either in the stone\r\ncoffin, or in the vault, when Shaw entered the gloomy chamber.\" Sir\r\nWalter Scott himself, has justly received many eulogies. Perhaps none\r\nmore heart-felt, than the effusion delivered at a late Celtic meeting,\r\nby that eloquent and honest lawyer, the present Lord Chief Justice of\r\nthe Court of Exchequer, in Scotland, which was received by long, loud,\r\nand continued applause.\r\n\r\n[38] John Bauhine wrote a Treatise in 1591, De Plantis a Divis sanctisve\r\nnomen habentibus.\r\n\r\nTheir Preface to the above Vol. ii. has this observation: \"Plants, when\r\ntaken from the places whence they derive their extraction, and planted\r\nin others of different qualities, _betray such fondness for their native\r\nearth_, that with great difficulty they are brought to thrive in\r\nanother; and in this it is that the florist's art consists; for _to\r\nhumour each plant_ with the soil, the sun, the shade, the degrees of\r\ndryness or moisture, and the neighbourhood it delights in, (for there is\r\na natural antipathy between some plants, insomuch that they will not\r\nthrive near one another) are things not easily attainable, but by a\r\nlength of study and application.\"\r\n\r\n[39] What these ruffles and lashes were, I know not. Perhaps the words\r\nof Johnson may apply to them:--\r\n\r\n   Fate never wounds more deep the generous heart,\r\n   Than when a blockhead's insult points the dart.\r\n   This mournful truth is every where confess'd,\r\n   Slow rises worth, by poverty oppress'd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[40] Barnaby Gooche, in his Chapter on Gardens, calls the sun \"the\r\ncaptaine and authour of the other lights, _the very soule of the\r\nworld_.\"\r\n\r\n[41] A translation of De Lille's garden thus pleads:--\r\n\r\n   Oh! by those shades, beneath whose evening bowers\r\n   The village dancers tripp'd the frolic hours;\r\n   By those deep tufts that show'd your fathers' tombs,\r\n   Spare, ye profane, their venerable glooms!\r\n   To violate their sacred age, beware,\r\n   Which e'en the awe-struck hand of time doth spare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[42] Mr. Whateley observes, that \"The whole range of nature is open to\r\nhim, (the landscape gardener) from the parterre to the forest; and\r\nwhatever is agreeable to the senses, or the imagination, he may\r\nappropriate to the spot he is to improve; it is a part of his business\r\nto collect into one place, the delights which are generally dispersed\r\nthrough different species of country.\"\r\n\r\n[43] At page 24 he says, \"_Cato_, one of the most celebrated writers on\r\nHusbandry and Gardening among the Romans, (who, as appears by his\r\nIntroduction, took the model of his precepts from the _Greeks_) in his\r\nexcellent Treatise _De Re Rustica_, has given so great an encomium on\r\nthe excellence and uses of this good plant, (the Brocoli) not only as to\r\nits goodness in eating, but also in physick and pharmacy, that makes it\r\nesteemed one of the best plants either the field or garden produces.\"\r\n\r\n[44] His Chapter on the Water-Works of the Ancient Romans, French, &c.\r\nis charmingly written. Those who delight in the formation of rivers,\r\nfountains, falls of water, or cascades, as decorations to their gardens,\r\nmay inspect this ingenious man's Hydrostatics. And another specimen of\r\nhis genius may be seen in the magnificent iron gateway now remaining at\r\n_Leeswood_, near Mold, and of which a print is given in Pugh's _Cambria\r\nDepicta_.\r\n\r\n[45] In this volume is a letter written to Switzer, from his \"ingenious\r\nfriend Mr. Thomas Knowlton, Gardener to the Earl of Burlington, who, on\r\naccount of his own industry, and the opportunity he has had of being\r\neducated under the late learned Dr. Sherrard, claims a very advanced\r\nplace in the list of Botanists.\" This letter is dated Lansborough, July,\r\n1728. I insert part of this letter:--\"I hope, Sir, you will excuse the\r\nfreedom I take in giving you my opinion, having always had a respect for\r\nyour endeavours in Husbandry and Gardening, ever since you commenced an\r\nauthor. Your introduction to, and manner of handling those beloved\r\nsubjects, (the sale of which I have endeavoured to promote) is in great\r\nesteem with me; being (as I think) the most useful of any that have been\r\nwrote on these useful subjects. If on any subject, you shall hereafter\r\nrevise or write farther upon, any communication of mine will be useful\r\nor serviceable to you, I shall be very ready to do it. I heartily wish\r\nyou success in whatever you undertake, as it tends to a publick good.\"\r\nDr. Pulteney says of Knowlton, \"His zeal for English Botany was\r\nuncommonly great, and recommended him successfully to the learned\r\nBotanists of this country. From Sir Hans Sloane, he received eminent\r\ncivilities.\"\r\n\r\n[46] few short notices occur of names formerly eminent in\r\ngardening:--\"My late ingenious and laborious friend, Mr. _Oram_,\r\nNurseryman, of Brompton-lane.\"\r\n\r\n\"That great virtuoso and encourager of gardening, Mr. Secretary Johnson,\r\nat Twickenham.\"\r\n\r\n\"Their beautiful aspects in pots, (the nonpareil) and the middle of a\r\ndesert, has been the glory of one of the most generous encouragers of\r\ngardening this age has produced, I mean the Right Honourable the Lord\r\nCastlemain.\"\r\n\r\n\"The late noble and most publick spirited encourager of arts and\r\nsciences, especially gardening, his Grace the Duke of Montague, at\r\nDitton.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Elrouge Nectarine is also a native of our own, the name being the\r\nreverse of _Gourle_, a famous Nurseryman at Hogsden, in King Charles the\r\nSecond's time, by whom it was raised.\"\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of the successful cultivation of vines in the open air, he\r\nrefers to the garden of a Mr. _Rigaud_, near _Swallow-street_; and to\r\nanother great cultivator of the vine, \"of whose friendship I have proof,\r\nthe Rev. Mr. _Only_, of _Cottesmore_, in Rutland, some time since\r\ndeceased; one of the most curious lovers of gardening that this or any\r\nother age has produced.\" This gentleman, in 1765, published \"An Account\r\nof the care taken in most civilized nations for the relief of the poor,\r\nmore particularly in the time of scarcity and distress;\" 4to. 1s. Davis.\r\nI believe the same gentleman also published, in 1765, a Treatise \"Of the\r\nPrice of Wheat.\"\r\n\r\n[47] Lord Bacon says, \"Because the breath of flowers is far sweeter in\r\nthe air (where it comes and goes, like the warbling of musick) than in\r\nthe hand, therefore nothing is more fit for that delight, than to know\r\nwhat be the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air.\" The Prince\r\nde Ligne says,\r\n\r\n   Je ne veux point avoir l'orgueilleuse tulipe;\r\n   _L'odorat en jardin_ est mon premier principe.\r\n\r\nThe translation of _Spectacle de la Nature_, a very pleasing work,\r\nobserves that \"Flowers are not only intended to beautify the earth with\r\ntheir shining colours, but the greatest part of them, in order to render\r\nthe entertainment more exquisite, diffuse a fragrance that perfumes all\r\nthe air around us; and it should seem as if they were solicitous to\r\n_reserve their odours for the evening and morn_, when walking is most\r\nagreeable; but their sweets are very faint during the heat of the day,\r\nwhen we visit them the least.\"\r\n\r\nI must again trespass on the pages of the great Bacon, by briefly\r\nshewing the _natural wildness_ he wishes to introduce into one part of\r\nhis garden:--\"thickets, made only of sweet-briar and honeysuckle, and\r\nsome wild vine amongst, and the ground set with violets, strawberries,\r\nand primroses; for these are sweet, and prosper in the shade.\"\r\n\r\nThe dew or pearly drops that one sees in a morning on cowslips, remind\r\none of what is said of Mignon:--\"Ses ouvrages sont precieux par l'art\r\navec le quel il representoit les fleurs dans tout leur eclat, et les\r\nfruits avec toute leur fraicheur. La rosee et les goutes d'eau qu'elle\r\nrepand sur les fleurs, sont si bien imitees dans ses tableaux, qu'on est\r\ntente d'y porter la main.\" It is said also that in the works of\r\nVan-Huysum, \"le veloute des fruits, l'eclat des fleurs, le transparent\r\nde la rosee, tout enchante dans les tableaux de ce peintre admirable.\"\r\nSir U. Price observes of this latter painter, \"that nature herself is\r\nhardly more soft and delicate in her most delicate productions, than the\r\ncopies of them by Van-Huysum.\" Two flower pieces by this painter, sold\r\nat the Houghton sale for 1200_l._\r\n\r\nIn the pieces of _Bos_, a Flemish painter, the dew was represented so\r\nmuch like nature, as to deserve universal approbation.\r\n\r\nBernazzano painted strawberries on a wall so naturally, that, we are\r\ntold, the plaster was torn down by the frequent pecking of peacocks.\r\n\r\nAmidst these celebrated painters, these admiring judges of nature, let\r\nus not forget our never-dying Hogarth; his piercing eye even discovers\r\nitself in his letter to Mr. Ellis, the naturalist:--\"As for your pretty\r\nlittle seed cups, or vases, they are a sweet confirmation of the\r\npleasure nature seems to take in superadding an elegance of form to most\r\nof her works, wherever you find them. How poor and bungling are all the\r\ninventions of art!\"\r\n\r\n[48] The very numerous works of this indefatigable writer, embracing so\r\nmany subjects, make one think he must have been as careful of his time,\r\nas the celebrated friend of the witty _Boileau_: the humane, benevolent,\r\nand dignified Chancellor _Aguesseau_, who finding that his wife always\r\nkept him waiting an hour after the dinner bell had rung, resolved to\r\ndevote this time to writing a work on Jurisprudence. He put this project\r\nin execution, and in the course of time, produced a quarto work in four\r\nthick volumes.\r\n\r\n[49] This chesnut tree is thus noticed in a newspaper of August,\r\n1829:--\"The celebrated chesnut tree, the property of Lord Ducie, at\r\nTortworth, in the county of Gloucester, is the oldest, if not the\r\nlargest tree in England, having this year attained the age of 1002\r\nyears, and being 52 feet in circumference, and yet retains so much\r\nvigour, that it bore nuts so lately as two years ago, from which young\r\ntrees are now being raised.\"\r\n\r\n[50] There is an 8vo. published in 1717, called the \"Lady's Recreation,\"\r\nby _Charles_ Evelyn, Esq. There are two letters subjoined, written to\r\nthis author by the Rev. Mr. Lawrence. From page 103, 105, 129 and 141,\r\none should think this was not the son of the famous Mr. Evelyn. I now\r\nfind, that Mr. Lawrence, in the Preface to his Kalendar, inserted at the\r\nend of his fifth edition, assures the public, \"that the book called the\r\nLady's Recreation could not be published by my approbation, because it\r\nwas never seen by me till it was in print; besides, I have reason to\r\nthink it was an artifice of the booksellers to impose upon the world,\r\nunder the borrowed name of Evelyn.\"\r\n\r\n[51] This sermon was preached for several years by Dr. Colin Milne, by\r\nwhom it was published in 1799, and afterwards by the Rev. Mr. Ellis, of\r\nMerchant Taylors' School. Mr. Ellis, in his History of Shoreditch, gives\r\nus much information as to this bequest; in which the handsome conduct of\r\nMr. Denne, a former vicar, is not the least interesting. Mr. Nichols, in\r\nvol. iii. of his Literary Anecdotes, bears testimony to Dr. Denne's\r\nfeeling towards the poor and distressed, and to his attachment to\r\nliterary pursuits. Three of these Sermons are in the second volume of\r\n\"Thirty Sermons on Moral and Religious Subjects, by the Rev. W. Jones;\"\r\n2 vols. 8vo. 1790, price 16s. There are other editions of Mr. Jones's\r\nSermons, viz. Rev. W. Jones, of Nayland, his Theological, Philosophical,\r\nand Miscellaneous Works, with Life, 12 vols. 8vo. _neat_, 7_l._ 7_s._\r\n6_d._ 1801. Sermons by the late Rev. William Jones, of Nayland, Suffolk:\r\nChaplain to the Right Rev. George Horne, Bishop of Norwich; 1 vol. 8vo.\r\nwith Portrait of the Author, price 12_s._ Dove, St. John's Square,\r\nPrinter, 1828. \"Of this faithful servant of God, (the Rev. W. Jones) I\r\ncan speak both from personal knowledge and from his writings. He was a\r\nman of quick penetration, of extensive learning, and the soundest piety;\r\nand he had, beyond any other man I ever knew, the talent of writing upon\r\nthe deepest subjects to the plainest understandings.\"--_Bishop Horsley's\r\nCharges._ The Rev. Samuel Ayscough, of the British Museum, began, in\r\n1790, to preach this annual sermon, and, I believe, continued it for\r\nfourteen years.\r\n\r\n[52] Mr. Ellis, of _Little Gaddesden_, in his Practical Farmer, 8vo.\r\n1732, thus speaks on this subject:--\"What a charming sight is a large\r\ntree in blossom, and after that, when loaden with fruit, enough perhaps\r\nto make a hogshead of cyder or perry! A scene of beauty, hopes, and\r\nprofit, and all! It may be on less than two feet diameter of ground. And\r\nabove all, what matter of contemplation does it afford, when we let our\r\nthoughts descend to a single kernel of an apple or pear? And again, how\r\nheightened, on the beholding so great a bulk raised and preserved, by\r\nOmnipotent Power, from so small a body.\"\r\n\r\n[53] The thought of planting the sides of public roads, was first\r\nsuggested by the great _Sully_.\r\n\r\n[54] Mr. Weston, in his introduction to these Tracts, seems to have\r\npleasure in recording the following anecdote of La Quintinye, from\r\nHarte's Essay. \"The famous La Quintinie, director of the royal gardens\r\nin France, obtained from Louis XIV. an abbacy for his son, in one of the\r\nremote provinces; and going soon afterwards to make the abbot a visit,\r\n(who was not then settled in his apartments) he was entertained and\r\nlodged by a neighbouring gentleman with great friendliness and\r\nhospitality. La Quintinie, as was natural, soon examined the gardens of\r\nhis host; he found the situation beautiful, and the soil excellent; but\r\nevery thing was rude, savage, and neglected: nature had done much, art\r\nnothing. The guest, delighted with his friendly reception, took leave\r\nwith regret, and some months after, sent one of the king's gardeners,\r\nand four under-gardeners, to the gentleman, with strict command to\r\naccept of no gratuity. They took possession of his little inclosure the\r\nmoment they arrived, and having digged it many times over, they manured,\r\nreplanted it, and left one of their number behind them, as a settled\r\nservant in the family. This young man was soon solicited to assist the\r\nneighbourhood, and filled their kitchen gardens and fruit gardens with\r\nthe _best_ productions of every kind, which are preserved and propagated\r\nto this very hour.\"\r\n\r\nIt is pleasing to enquire who Mons. de la Quintinye was. _Perrault_, in\r\nhis _Hommes Illustres_, has given his Life, and Portrait. Dr. Gibson, in\r\nhis Fruit Gardener, calls him \"truly an original author;\" and further\r\npays him high compliments.\r\n\r\nThe Noveau Dict. Hist. thus speaks of him:--\"Il vint a Paris se faire\r\nrecevoir avocat. Une eloquence naturelle, cultivee avec soin, le fit\r\nbriller dans le Barreau, et lui consila l'estime des premiers\r\nmagistrais. Quoi qu'il eut peu de temps dont il put disposer, il en\r\ntrouvoit neanmoins suffisament pour satisfaire la passion qu'il avoit\r\npour l'agriculture. Il augmenta ses connoissances sur le jardinage, dans\r\nun voyage qu'il fit en Italie. De retour a Paris, il se livra tout\r\nentier a l'agriculture, et fit un grand nombre d'experiences curieuses\r\net utiles. Le grand Prince de _Conde_, qui aimoit l'agriculture, prenoit\r\nune extreme plaisir a s'entretenir avec lui; et Charles II. Roi\r\nd'Angleterre lui offrit une pension considerable pour l'attacher a la\r\nculture de ses Jardins, mais il refusa ses offres avantageuses par\r\nl'amour qu'il avoit pour sa patrie, et trouva en France les recompenses\r\ndue a son merite. On a de lui un excellent livre, intitule 'Instructions\r\npour les Jardins Fruitiers et Potagers, Paris, 1725, 2 tom. 4to.' _et\r\nplusieurs Lettres sur la meme matiere_.\" Switzer, in his History of\r\nGardening, says, that in Mons. de la Quintinye's \"Two Voyages into\r\nEngland, he gained considerable friendship with several lords with whom\r\nhe kept correspondence by letters till his death, and these letters,\r\nsays Perrault, are all _printed at London_.\" And he afterwards says,\r\nspeaking of Lord Capel's garden at Kew, \"the greatest advance made by\r\nhim herein, was the bringing over several sorts of fruits from France;\r\nand this noble lord we may suppose to be one that held for many years a\r\ncorrespondence with Mons. de la Quintinye.\" Such letters on such\r\ncorrespondence if ever printed, must be worth perusal.\r\n\r\n[55] Lamoignon de Malherbes (that excellent man) had naturalized a vast\r\nnumber of foreign trees, and at the age of eighty-four, saw every where,\r\nin France, (as Duleuze observes) plants of his own introduction.\r\n\r\nThe old Earl of _Tweedale_, in the reign of Charles II. and his\r\nimmediate successor, planted more than six thousand acres, in Scotland,\r\nwith fir trees. In a Tour through Scotland, in 1753, it mentions, that\r\n\"The county of Aberdeen is noted for its timber, having in it upwards of\r\nfive millions of fir trees, besides vast numbers of other kinds, planted\r\nwithin these seventy years, by the gentry at and about their seats.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Marshall, in his \"Planting and Rural Ornament,\" states, that \"In\r\n1792, his Grace the Duke of Athol (we speak from the highest authority)\r\nwas possessed of a thousand larch trees, then growing on his estates of\r\nDunkeld and Blair only, of not less than two to four tons of timber\r\neach; and had, at that time, a million larches, of different sizes,\r\nrising rapidly on his estate.\"\r\n\r\nThe zeal for planting in Scotland, of late years, has been stimulated by\r\nthe writings of James Anderson, and Lord Kames.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasing to transcribe the following paragraph from a newspaper of\r\nthe year 1819:--\"Sir Watkin Williams Wynn has planted, within the last\r\nfive years, on the mountainous lands in the vicinity of Llangollen,\r\nsituated from 1200 to 1400 feet above the level of the sea, 80,000 oaks,\r\n63,000 Spanish chesnuts, 102,000 spruce firs, 110,000 Scotch firs,\r\n90,000 larches, 30,000 wych elms, 35,000 mountain elms, 80,000 ash, and\r\n40,000 sycamores, all of which are, at this time, in a healthy and\r\nthriving condition.\" It is impossible, on this subject, to avoid paying\r\na grateful respect to the memory of that bright ornament of our church,\r\nand literature, the late Dr. Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, whose extensive\r\nplantations, near Ambleside, have long since enriched that part. The\r\nlate Richard Crawshay (surpassed by no being during the whole course of\r\nhis very long life, for either integrity or generosity) assured the\r\npresent writer, that during an early period of Dr. Watson's planting, he\r\noffered him, on the security of his note of hand only, and to be repaid\r\nat his own entire convenience, ten thousand pounds, and that he (with\r\ngrateful thanks to Mr. Crawshay) refused it.\r\n\r\n[56] How widely different has the liberal and classic mind of Dr. Alison\r\nviewed the rich pages of Mr. Whateley, in his deep and learned Essays on\r\nTaste, first published nearly twenty years after Mr. Whateley's decease.\r\nOne regrets that there is no Portrait of Mr. Whateley. Of Dr. Alison,\r\nthere is a masterly one by Sir Henry Raeburn, admirably engraved by W.\r\nWalker, of Edinburgh, in 1823. Perhaps it is one of the finest Portraits\r\nof the present day. One is happy to perceive marks of health expressed\r\nin his intellectually striking countenance.\r\n\r\n[57] In Biographical Anecdotes, 3 vols. 8vo. appears a correspondence in\r\nLondon, with Dr. Franklin, and William Whateley, and Joseph Whateley, in\r\n1774. This relates to a duel with Mr. Temple, by a brother of Thomas\r\nWhateley. In some of the Lives of Dr. Franklin, it appears, that\r\ninflammatory and ill-judged letters were written by George Hutchinson,\r\nand others, to _Thomas_ Whateley, Esq. _private Secretary to Lord\r\nGrenville_, respecting some disturbances in America, concerning Lord\r\nGrenville's Stamp Act. On the death of Thomas, these letters were placed\r\nin the hands of Dr. Franklin, whose duty, as agent to the colony, caused\r\nhim to transmit them to Boston. A quarrel arose between William Whateley\r\nand Mr. Temple, as to which of them gave up those letters, and a duel\r\nwas fought. Dr. Franklin immediately cleared both those gentlemen from\r\nall imputation. Of the celebrated interview in the council chamber,\r\nbetween Mr. Wedderburn and Dr. Franklin, an account is given by Dr.\r\nPriestley, in vol. xv. page 1. of the Monthly Magazine, and which candid\r\naccount entirely acquits Dr. Franklin from having deserved the rancorous\r\npolitical acrimony of Mr. Wedderburn, whose intemperate language is\r\nfully related in some of the Lives of Dr. Franklin, and in his Life,\r\npublished and sold by G. Nicholson, _Stourport_, 12mo. price 9d. and\r\nwhich also includes Dr. Priestley's account.\r\n\r\nLord Chatham spoke of Franklin in the highest strain of panegyric, when\r\nadverting, in the year 1777, to his dissuasive arguments against the\r\nAmerican war.\r\n\r\nWilliam Whateley was administrator of the goods and chattels of his\r\nbrother Thomas, who, of course, died without a will.\r\n\r\nIn vol. ii. of Seward's Biog. Lit. and Political Tracts, the nineteenth\r\nchapter consists of his account of two _Political_ Tracts, by Thomas\r\nWhateley, Esq. and he thus concludes this chapter:--\"Mr. Whateley also\r\nwrote a tract on laying out pleasure grounds.\" In vol. iii. is an\r\naccount of the quarrel and duel with Mr. Temple and one of the brothers.\r\nIt appears that Thomas Whateley died in June, 1772, and left two\r\nbrothers, William and Joseph. Thomas is called \"Mr. Secretary Whately.\"\r\n\r\nDebrett published \"Scarce Tracts,\" in 4 vols. 8vo. In vol. i. is one\r\ncalled \"The Budget,\" by D. Hartley, Esq. This same volume contains a\r\nreply to this, viz. \"Remarks on the Budget, by Thomas Whateley, Esq.\r\nSecretary to the Treasury.\" There is also in vol. ii. another tract by\r\nThomas Whateley, Esq. entitled \"Considerations on the Trade and Finances\r\nof the Kingdom.\" These two pamphlets, upon subjects so very different\r\nfrom the alluring one on landscape gardening, and his unfinished one on\r\nShakspeare, convinces us, what a powerful writer he would have been, had\r\nhis life been longer spared.\r\n\r\n[58] The reader will be amply gratified by perusing page 158 of the late\r\nSir U. Price's well known Letter to Mr. Repton, as well as Mr. Morris's\r\nObservations on Water, as regards Ornamental Scenery; inserted in the\r\nGardener's Magazine for May, 1827. Mr. Whateley's distinction between a\r\nriver, a rivulet, and a rill, form, perhaps, five of the most seductive\r\npages of his book. Our own Shakspeare's imagery on this subject, should\r\nnot be overlooked:--\r\n\r\n   The current that with gentle murmur glides,\r\n   Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;\r\n   But when his fair course is not hindered,\r\n   He makes sweet music with the enamelled stones,\r\n   Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge\r\n   He overtaketh in his pilgrimage:\r\n   And so by many winding nooks he strays\r\n   With willing sport to the wild ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[59] The benevolent mind of the marquis shines even in his concluding\r\nchapter; for he there wishes \"to bring us back to a true taste for\r\nbeautiful nature--to more humane and salutary regulations of the\r\ncountry--to produce the _moral_ landscapes which delight the mind. His\r\nview of the good mother, seeing her children playing round her at their\r\ncottage, near the common, thus \"endearing her home, and making even the\r\nair she breathed more delightful to her, make these sort of commons, to\r\nme, the most delightful of _English gardens_. The dwellings of the happy\r\nand peaceful husbandmen would soon rise up in the midst of compact\r\nfarms. Can there exist a more delightful habitation for man, than a neat\r\nfarm-house in the centre of a pleasing landscape? There avoiding disease\r\nand lassitude, useless expence, the waste of land in large and dismal\r\nparks, and above all, by preventing misery, and promoting happiness, we\r\nshall indeed have gained the prize of having united the agreeable with\r\nthe useful. Perhaps, when every folly is exhausted, there will come a\r\ntime, in which men will be so far enlightened as to prefer the real\r\npleasures of nature to vanity and chimera.\"\r\n\r\n[60] Perhaps it may gratify those who seek for health, by their\r\nattachment to gardens, to note the age that some of our English\r\nhorticulturists have attained to:--Parkinson died at about 78;\r\nTradescant, the father, died an old man; Switzer, about 80; Sir Thomas\r\nBrowne died at 77; Evelyn, at 86; Dr. Beale, at 80; Jacob Bobart, at 85;\r\nCollinson, at 75; a son of Dr. Lawrence (equally fond of gardens as his\r\nfather) at 86; Bishop Compton, at 81; Bridgman, at an advanced age;\r\nKnowlton, gardener to Lord Burlington, at 90; Miller, at 80; James Lee,\r\nat an advanced age; Lord Kames, at 86; Abercrombie, at 80; the Rev. Mr.\r\nGilpin, at 80; Duncan, a gardener, upwards of 90; Hunter, who published\r\n_Sylva_, at 86; Speechley, at 86; Horace Walpole, at 80; Mr. Bates, the\r\ncelebrated and ancient horticulturist of High Wickham, who died there in\r\nDecember, 1819, at the great age of 89; Marshall, at an advanced age;\r\nSir Jos. Banks, at 77; Joseph Cradock, at 85; James Dickson, at 89; Dr.\r\nAndrew Duncan, at 83; and Sir U. Price, at 83. Mr. Loudon, at page 1063\r\nof his Encyclop. inform us, that a market garden, and nursery, near\r\nParson's Green, had been, for upwards of two centuries, occupied by a\r\nfamily of the name of Rench; that one of them (who instituted the first\r\nannual exhibition of flowers) died at the age of ninety-nine years,\r\nhaving had thirty-three children; and that his son (mentioned by\r\nCollinson, as famous for forest trees) introduced the moss-rose, planted\r\nthe elm trees now growing in the Bird-cage Walk, St. James's Park, from\r\ntrees reared in his own nursery, married two wives, had thirty-five\r\nchildren, and died in 1783, in the same room in which he was born, at\r\nthe age of a hundred and one years. Reflecting on the great age of some\r\nof the above, reminds me of what a \"Journal Encyclopedique\" said of\r\nLestiboudois, another horticulturist and botanist, who died at Lille, at\r\nthe age of ninety, and who (for even almost in our ashes _live their\r\nwonted fires_) gave lectures in the very last year of his life. \"When he\r\nhad (says an ancient friend of his) but few hours more to live, he\r\nordered snow-drops, violets, and crocuses, to be brought to his bed, and\r\ncompared them with the figures in Tournefort. His whole existence had\r\nbeen consecrated to the good of the public, and to the alleviation of\r\nmisery; thus he looked forward to his dissolution with a tranquillity of\r\nsoul that can only result from a life of rectitude; he never acquired a\r\nfortune; and left no other inheritance to his children, but integrity\r\nand virtue.\"\r\n\r\n[61] About eighty years previous to Hyll's Treatise on Bees, Rucellai,\r\nan Italian of distinction, who aspired to a cardinal's hat, and who\r\nlaboured with zeal and taste (I am copying from De Sismondi's View of\r\nthe Literature of the South of Europe) to render Italian poetry\r\nclassical, or a pure imitation of the ancients, published his most\r\ncelebrated poem on Bees. \"It receives (says De Sismondi) a particular\r\ninterest from the real fondness which Rucellai seems to have entertained\r\nfor these creatures. There is something so sincere in his respect for\r\ntheir virgin purity, and in his admiration of the order of their\r\ngovernment, that he inspires us with real interest for them. All his\r\ndescriptions are full of life and truth.\"\r\n\r\n[62] Ben Jonson, in his _Discourses_, gives the following eulogy on this\r\nillustrious author:--\"No member of his speech but consisted of his own\r\ngraces. His hearers could not cough or look aside from him without loss.\r\nHe commanded where he spoke, and had his judges angry and pleased at his\r\ndevotion: no man had their affections more in his power; the fear of\r\nevery man that heard him was, lest he should make an end.\" Mr. Loudon,\r\nwhen treating on the study of plants, observes, that \"This wonderful\r\nphilosopher explored and developed the true foundations of human\r\nknowledge, with a sagacity and penetration unparalleled in the history\r\nof mankind.\" What Clement VIII. applied to the eight books of Hooker's\r\nEcclesiastical Polity, may well apply to the writings of Bacon:--\"there\r\nis no learning that this man hath not searched into. His books will get\r\nreverence by age, for there is in them such seeds of eternity, that they\r\nwill continue till the last fire shall devour all learning.\" Monsieur\r\nThomas, in his Eulogy of Descartes, says, \"Bacon explored every path of\r\nhuman knowledge, he sat in judgment on past ages, and anticipated those\r\nthat were to come.\" The reader will be gratified by inspecting the\r\nsecond volume of Mr. Malone's publication of Aubrey's Letters, in the\r\nBodleian Library, as well as the richly decorated and entertaining\r\nBeauties of England and Wales, and Pennant's Tour from Chester to\r\nLondon, for some curious notices of the ancient mansion, garden, and\r\norchard, at Gorhambury.\r\n\r\n[63] The reader will be amply gratified by Mr. Johnson's review of the\r\ngeneral state of horticulture at this period, in his History of English\r\nGardening, and with the zeal with which he records the attachment of\r\nJames I. and Charles, to this science; and where, in a subsequent\r\nchapter, he glances on the progress of our Botany, and proudly twines\r\nround the brows of the modest, but immortal, Ray, a most deserved and\r\ngenerous wreath.\r\n\r\n[64] I subjoin a few extracts from the first book of his English\r\nHusbandman, 4to. 1635:--\"A garden is so profitable, necessary, and such\r\nan ornament and grace to every house and housekeeper, that the\r\ndwelling-place is lame and maimed if it want that goodly limbe, and\r\nbeauty. I do not wonder either at the worke of art, or nature, when I\r\nbehold in a goodly, rich and fertill soyle, a garden adorned with all\r\nthe delights and delicacies which are within man's understanding,\r\nbecause the naturall goodnesse of the earth (which not enduring to bee\r\nidle) will bring forth whatsoever is cast into her; but when I behold\r\nupon a barren, dry, and dejected earth, such as the Peake-hills, where a\r\nman may behold snow all summer, or on the East-mores, whose best herbage\r\nis nothing but mosse, and iron-stone, in such a place, I say, to behold\r\na delicate, rich, and fruitful garden, it shewes great worthinesse in\r\nthe owner, and infinite art and industry in the workeman, and makes mee\r\nboth admire and love the begetters of such excellencies.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again,--\"For the situation of the garden-plot for pleasure, you\r\nshall understand, that it must ever bee placed so neare unto the\r\ndwelling-house as it is possible, both because the eye of the owner may\r\nbe a guard and support from inconveniences, as all that the especial\r\nroomes and prospects of the house may be adorned, perfumed, and inriched\r\nwith the delicate proportions, odoriferous smells, and wholesome airs\r\nwhich shall ascend and vaporate from the same.\"\r\n\r\nHe then gives a variety of cuts of knots and mazes, and labyrinths, of\r\nwhich he observes, that \"many other adornations and beautifyings there\r\nare, which belong to the setting forth of a curious garden, but for as\r\nmuch as none are more rare or more esteemed than these I have set down,\r\nbeing the best ornaments of the best gardens of this kingdome, I think\r\nthem tastes sufficient for every husbandman or other of better quality,\r\nwhich delighteth in the beauty, and well trimming of his ground.\" He\r\nthus remarks:--\"as in the composition of a delicate woman, the grace of\r\nher cheeke is the mixture of red and white, the wonder of her eye blacke\r\nand white, and the beauty of her hand blew and white, any of which is\r\nnot said to be beautifull if it consist of single or simple colours; and\r\nso in these walkes or alleyes the all greene, nor the all yellow cannot\r\nbe said to bee most beautifull, but the greene and yellow, (that is to\r\nsay, the untroade grasse, and the well knit gravell) being equally mixt,\r\ngive the eye both luster and delight beyond all comparison.\"\r\n\r\nHis description of the following flower is singular: \"_The Crowne\r\nEmperiall_, is, of all flowers, both forraigne and home-bred, the\r\ndelicatest, and strangest: it hath the true shape of an imperiall\r\ncrowne, and will be of divers colours, according to the art of the\r\ngardener. In the middest of the flower you shall see a round pearle\r\nstand, in proportion, colour, and orientnesse, like a true naturall\r\npearle, only it is of a soft liquid substance: this pearle, if you shake\r\nthe flower never so violently, will not fall off, neyther if you let it\r\ncontinue never so long, will it eyther encrease or diminish in the\r\nbignesse, but remaineth all one: yet if with your finger you take and\r\nwipe it away, in less than an hour after you shall have another arise in\r\nthe same place, and of the same bignesse. This pearle, if you taste it\r\nupon your tongue, is pleasant, and sweet like honey: this flower when\r\nthe sunne ariseth, you shall see it looke directly to the east, with the\r\nstalk bent lowe thereunto, and as the sunne ariseth higher and higher,\r\nso the flower will likewise ascend, and when the sunne is come into the\r\nmeridian or noone poynt, which is directly over it, then will it stand\r\nupright upon the stalke, and looke directly upward, and as the sunne\r\ndeclineth, so will it likewise decline, and at the sunne setting looke\r\ndirectly to the west only.\"\r\n\r\nHis mention of another flower is attractive:--\"Now for your _Wall\r\nGilliflower_, it delighteth in hard rubbish, limy, and stony grounds,\r\nwhence it commeth they covet most to grow upon walls, pavements, and\r\nsuch like barraine places. It may be sowen in any moneth or season, for\r\nit is a seed of that hardness, that it makes no difference betwixt\r\nwinter and summer, but will flourish in both equally, and beareth his\r\nflowers all the yeere, whence it comes that the husbandman preserves it\r\nmost in his _bee-garden_, for it is _wondrous sweet_, and affordeth much\r\nhoney. It would be sowen in very small quantity, for after it hath once\r\ntaken roote, it will naturally of itself overspread much ground, and\r\nhardly ever after be rooted out. It is of itselfe of so exceeding a\r\nstrong, and _sweet smell_, that it cannot be forced to take any other,\r\nand therefore is ever preserved in its owne nature.\"\r\n\r\n[65] Mr. Loudon, in his Encycl. of Gardening, fondly reviews the taste\r\nfor flowers which pervaded most ranks during the time of Elizabeth, and\r\nEvelyn.\r\n\r\nThe _Spectacle de la Nature_, of which we have a translation in 1740,\r\nhas a richly diffuse chapter on flowers. I here transcribe a small part\r\nthereof:--\r\n\r\n_Prior._ \"The beauty of flowers never fails to inspire us with joy; and\r\nwhen we have sufficiently examined the fairest, we are sensible they are\r\nonly proper to refresh the sight; and, indeed, the prospect they afford\r\nis so touching, and we experience their power to be so effectual, that\r\nthe generality of those arts which are ambitious to please, seem most\r\nsuccessful when they borrow their assistance. Sculpture imitates them in\r\nits softest ornaments; architecture bestows the embellishments of leaves\r\nand festoons on those columns and fronts, which would otherwise be too\r\nnaked. The richest embroideries are little more than foliage and\r\nflowers; the most magnificent silks are almost covered with these\r\ncharming forms, and are thought beautiful, in proportion as they\r\nresemble the lively tinge of natural flowers.\r\n\r\n\"These have always been the symbols, or representations of joy; they\r\nwere formerly the inseparable ornaments of feasts, and are still\r\nintroduced with applause, toward the close of our entertainments, when\r\nthey are brought in with the fruit, to enliven the festival that begins\r\nto languish. And they are so peculiarly adapted to scenes of pleasure,\r\nthat they are always considered as inconsistent with mourning. Decency,\r\ninformed by nature, never admits them into those places where tears and\r\naffliction are predominant.\r\n\r\n_Countess._ \"The festivals in the country are never celebrated without\r\ngarlands, and the entertainments of the polite are ushered in by a\r\nflower. If the winter denies them that gratification, they have recourse\r\nto art. A young bride, in all the magnificence of her nuptial array,\r\nwould imagine she wanted a necessary part of her ornaments, if she did\r\nnot improve them with a sprig of flowers. A queen, amidst the greatest\r\nsolemnities, though she is covered with the jewels of the crown, has an\r\ninclination to this rural ornament; she is not satisfied with mere\r\ngrandeur and majesty, but is desirous of assuming an air of softness and\r\ngaiety, by the mediation of flowers.\r\n\r\n_Prior._ \"Religion itself, with all its simplicity and abstraction, and\r\namidst the abhorrence it professes to theatrical pomp, which rather\r\ntends to dissipate the heart, than to inspire it with a due reverence\r\nfor sacred mysteries, and a sensibility of human wants, permits some of\r\nits festivals to be celebrated with boughs, and chaplets of flowers.\"\r\n\r\n[66] In his Diary is the following entry:--\"1658, 27 Jan. After six fits\r\nof an ague, died my son Richard, five years and three days old onely,\r\nbut, at that tender age, a prodigy for witt and understanding; for\r\nbeauty of body, a very angel; for endowment of mind, of incredible and\r\nrare hopes. He was all life, all prettinesse. What shall I say of his\r\nfrequent pathetical ejaculations uttered of himselfe: _Sweete Jesus,\r\nsave me, deliver me, pardon my sins, let thine angels receive me!_ So\r\nearly knowledge, so much piety and perfection! Such a child I never saw!\r\nfor such a child I blesse God in whose bosome he is!\"\r\n\r\nNanteuil's portrait is prefixed to his _Sylva_, 1664; and a fine copy of\r\nthe same, by Bartolozzi, is prefixed to Hunter's _Sylva_. Worlidge\r\nengraved a fine portrait of him, prefixed to his _Sculptura_. Gaywood\r\nengraved his portrait for the translation of _Lucretius_. In Walpole's\r\nAnecdotes is his portrait, by Bannerman.\r\n\r\n[67] In \"A Picturesque Promenade round Dorking,\" are selected many\r\ninteresting particulars of Mr. Evelyn.\r\n\r\n[68] Essex lost his head for having said that Elizabeth grew old and\r\ncankered, and that her mind was as crooked as her carcase. Perhaps the\r\nbeauty of Mary galled Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThe Quarterly Review of July, 1828, thus remarks:--\"When Elizabeth's\r\nwrinkles waxed many, it is reported that an unfortunate master of the\r\nMint incurred disgrace, by a too faithful shilling; the die was broken,\r\nand only one mutilated impression is now in existence. Her maids of\r\nhonour took the hint, and were thenceforth careful that no fragment of a\r\nlooking glass should remain in any room of the palace. In fact, the\r\nlion-hearted lady had not heart to look herself in the face for the last\r\ntwenty years of her life.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems that Elizabeth was fond of executions. She loved Essex, of all\r\nmen, best; and yet the same axe which murdered Anne Bulleyn, was used to\r\nrevenge herself on him. The bloody task took three strokes, which so\r\nenraged the multitude, (who loved Essex) that they would have torn the\r\nexecutioner to pieces, had not the soldiers prevented them. Mr. Hutton,\r\nin his \"Journey to London,\" observes, that \"their vengeance ought to\r\nhave been directed against the person who caused him to use it.\" What\r\nher reflections were on these two bloody acts when on her death-bed, we\r\nscarcely know. A modern writer on horticulture, nearly concludes a very\r\npleasing work, by enumerating (with slight historical notices) the\r\nseveral plants cultivated in our gardens. He thus concludes his account\r\nof one:--\"Queen Elizabeth, in her last illness, eat little but Succory\r\nPottage.\" Mr. Loudon says it is used \"as a fodder for cattle.\" The\r\nFrench call it Chicoree _sauvage_. Her taste must have been something\r\nlike her heart. Poor Mary eat no supper the night previous to _her_ last\r\nillness. Had it been possible for Elizabeth to have read those pages of\r\nRobertson, which paint the long succession of calamities which befel\r\nMary, and the insolence and brutality she received from Darnley, and\r\nwhich so eloquently plead for her frailties, perhaps even these pages\r\nwould not have softened her bloody disposition, which she seems to have\r\ninherited from that insolent monster, her father. \"Mary's sufferings\r\n(says this enchanting historian) exceed, both in degree and duration,\r\nthose tragical distresses which fancy has feigned, to excite sorrow and\r\ncommiseration; and while we survey them, we are apt altogether to forget\r\nher frailties; we think of her faults with less indignation, and approve\r\nof our tears as if they were shed for a person who had attained much\r\nnearer to pure virtue. With regard to the queen's person, all\r\ncontemporary authors agree in ascribing to Mary the utmost beauty of\r\ncountenance, and elegance of shape, of which the human form is capable.\r\nHer hair was black, though, according to the fashion of that age, she\r\nfrequently borrowed locks, and of different colours. Her eyes were a\r\ndark grey; her complexion was exquisitely fine, and her hands and arms\r\nremarkably delicate, both as to shape and colour. Her stature was of an\r\nheight that rose to the majestic. She danced, she walked, and she rode\r\nwith equal grace. She sung, and played upon the lute with uncommon\r\nskill.\"\r\n\r\n[69] I will merely give this brief extract as one out of many of great\r\nforce and beauty, from his _Salmonia_:--\"If we look with wonder upon the\r\ngreat remains of human works, such as the columns of Palmyra, broken in\r\nthe midst of the desert, the temples of Paestum, beautiful in the decay\r\nof twenty centuries, or the mutilated fragments of Greek sculpture in\r\nthe Acropolis of Athens, or in our own Museum, as proofs of the genius\r\nof artists, and power and riches of nations now past away, with how much\r\ndeeper feeling of admiration must we consider those grand monuments of\r\nnature, which mark the revolutions of the globe; continents broken into\r\nislands; one land produced, another destroyed; the bottom of the ocean\r\nbecome a fertile soil; whole races of animals extinct; and the bones and\r\nexuviae of one class covered with the remains of another, and upon the\r\ngraves of past generations--the marble or rocky tomb, as it were, of a\r\nformer animated world--new generations rising, and order and harmony\r\nestablished, and a system of life and beauty produced, as it were, out\r\nof chaos and death; proving the infinite power, wisdom, and goodness, of\r\nthe GREAT CAUSE OF ALL BEING!\" I must trespass on my reader, by again\r\nquoting from _Salmonia_:--\"I envy no quality of the mind or intellect in\r\nothers; not genius, power, wit, or fancy; but if I could choose what\r\nwould be most delightful, and I believe most useful to me, I should\r\nprefer _a firm religious belief_ to every other blessing; for it makes\r\nlife a discipline of goodness--creates new hopes, when all earthly hopes\r\nvanish; and throws over the decay, the destruction of existence, the\r\nmost gorgeous of lights; awakens life even in death, and from corruption\r\nand decay calls up beauty and divinity: makes an instrument of torture\r\nand of shame the ladder of ascent to Paradise; and, far above all\r\ncombinations of earthly hopes, calls up the most delightful visions of\r\npalms and amaranths, the gardens of the blest, the security of\r\neverlasting joys, where the sensualist and the sceptic view only gloom,\r\ndecay, annihilation, and despair!\"\r\n\r\n[70] In this delightful essay, he says, \"the most exquisite delights of\r\nsense are pursued, in the contrivance and plantation of gardens, which,\r\nwith fruits, flowers, shades, fountains, and the music of birds that\r\nfrequent such happy places, seem to furnish all the pleasures of the\r\nseveral senses.\"\r\n\r\n[71] Mr. Johnson, in his History of English Gardening, admirably\r\nconfirms this conflagration argument, by quoting the opinion or\r\ntestimony of the celebrated Goethe.\r\n\r\n[72] To this interesting subject is devoted, a part of Mr. Loudon's\r\nconcise and luminous review \"Of the Rise, Progress, and Present State of\r\nGardening in the British Isles;\" being chapter iv. of his Encyclopaedia.\r\n\r\n[73] Perhaps there are few pages that more awfully paint the sacredness\r\nof this spot, than page 36 in the fifth edition of Dr. Alison's Essays\r\non Taste.\r\n\r\n[74] I do not mean to apply to the hospitable table of this reverend\r\ngentleman, the lines of Peter Pindar:--\r\n\r\n   One cut from _venison_, to the heart can speak,\r\n   Stronger than ten quotations from the _Greek_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[75] I cannot prevent myself from quoting a very small portion of the\r\nanimated address of another clergyman, the Rev. J. G. Morris, as\r\nchairman to the Wakefield Horticultural Society. I am certain each one\r\nof my readers will blame me for not having inserted the whole of this\r\neloquent appeal. I copy it from the Gardener's Magazine for August,\r\n1828:--\"Conscious that I possessed no qualifications to fit me for the\r\ntask, and feeling that it ill became me to assume it, as I am as yet\r\nnearly a stranger amongst you; aware, too, that I should be surrounded\r\nby individuals so much more eligible, inasmuch as they are eminently\r\ngifted with botanical science and practical knowledge, the result of\r\ntheir horticultural pursuits and facilities, of which I am quite devoid;\r\nI wished and begged to decline the proffered honour. It appears,\r\nhowever, that my entreaties are not listened to, and that your kindness\r\nand partiality persist in selecting for your chairman one so inadequate\r\nto the situation. Gentlemen, I take the chair with much diffidence; but\r\nI will presume to say, that, in the absence of other qualities, I bring\r\nwith me a passionate love for plants and flowers, for the sweets and\r\nbeauties of the garden, and no inconsiderable fondness for its more\r\nsubstantial productions. Gardening, as a recreation and relaxation from\r\nseverer studies and more important avocations, has exquisite charms for\r\nme; and I am ready, with old _Gerarde_, to confess, that 'the principal\r\ndelight is in the mind, singularly enriched with the knowledge of these\r\nvisible things; setting forth to us the invisible wisdom and admirable\r\nworkmanship of Almighty God.' With such predilections, you will easily\r\ngive me credit, gentlemen, for participating with this assembly in the\r\nsincerest wishes for the complete and permanent establishment of a\r\nsociety amongst us, whose object shall be to promote, in the surrounding\r\ndistrict, the introduction of different sorts of flowers, culinary\r\nvegetables, fruits, improved culture and management generally, and _a\r\ntaste_ for botany as a science. These are pursuits, gentlemen, combining\r\nat once health and innocence, pleasure and utility. Wakefield and its\r\nvicinity appear to possess facilities for the accomplishment of such a\r\nproject, inferior to no district within this great palatinate, indeed,\r\nlittle inferior to any in the kingdom. The country is beautiful and\r\ncharmingly varied, and, from the diversity of soil, suited to varied\r\nproductions; the whole thickly interspersed with seats and villas of\r\npersons of opulence, possessing their conservatories, hot-houses, and\r\nstoves, their orchards, flower and kitchen gardens: whilst few towns can\r\nboast (as Wakefield can) of so many gardens within its enclosure,\r\ncultivated with so much assiduity and skill, so much taste and deserved\r\nsuccess. Seven years ago, I had the honour to originate a similar\r\nproject in Preston, in Lancashire, and with the happiest success. In\r\nthat borough, possessing far less advantages than Wakefield offers, a\r\nhorticultural society was established, which, in its four annual\r\nmeetings, assembles all the rank and fashion of a circuit of more than\r\nten miles, and numbers more than a hundred and twenty subscribers to its\r\nfunds. Those who have not witnessed the interesting sight, can form but\r\na faint idea of the animating scene which is presented in a spacious and\r\nhandsome room, tastefully adorned with the choicest exotics from various\r\nconservatories, and the more choice, because selected with a view to\r\ncompetition: decorated with the varied beauties of the parterre, vieing\r\nwith each other in fragrance, hue, and delicacy of texture; whilst the\r\ntables groan under the weight of delicious fruits and rare vegetables in\r\nendless variety, the joint produce of hot-houses, stoves, orchards, and\r\nkitchen gardens. Figure to yourselves, gentlemen, this elysium, graced\r\nby some hundreds of our fair countrywomen, an absolute galaxy of\r\nanimated beauty, and that music lends its aid, and you will agree with\r\nme that a more fascinating treat could hardly be devised. New flowers,\r\nnew fruits, recent varieties of those of long standing and established\r\ncharacter for excellence, are thus introduced, in lieu of those whose\r\ninferiority is no longer doubtful. New culinary vegetables, or, from\r\nsuperior treatment or mode of culture, rendered more salubrious and of\r\nexquisite flavour, will load the stalls of our market-gardeners. I call\r\nupon you, then, gentlemen, for your zealous support. Say not that you\r\nhave no gardens, or that your gardens are inconsiderable, or that you\r\nare no cultivators; you are all interested in having good and delicious\r\nfruits, nutritious and delicate culinary vegetables, and in procuring\r\nthem at a reasonable rate, which will be the results of improved and\r\nsuccessful cultivation. At our various exhibitions, let each contribute\r\nthat in which he excels, and our object will be attained. Gentlemen, I\r\nfear I have trespassed too long on your patience and indulgence. I will\r\njust urge one more motive for your warm support of our intended society;\r\nit is this: that, by diffusing a love of plants and gardening, you will\r\nmaterially contribute to the comfort and happiness of the laborious\r\nclasses; for the pleasure taken in such pursuits forms an\r\nunexceptionable relaxation from the toils of business, and every hour\r\nthus spent is subtracted from the ale-house and other haunts of idleness\r\nand dissipation.\"\r\n\r\n[76] In the grounds of _Hagley_, were once inscribed these lines:--\r\n\r\n   Here Pope!--ah, never must that tow'ring mind\r\n   To his loved haunts, or dearer friend return;\r\n   What art, what friendships! oh! what fame resign'd:\r\n   In yonder glade I trace his mournful urn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[77] At Holm-Lacey is preserved a sketch, in crayons, by Pope, (when on\r\na visit there) of Lord Strafford by Vandyke. It is well known that Pope\r\npainted Betterton in oil colours, and gave it to Lord Mansfield. The\r\nnoble lord regretted the loss of this memorial, when his house was\r\nconsumed at the time of the disgraceful and ignorant riots.\r\n\r\n[78] Sir Joshua Reynolds used to tell the following anecdote relative to\r\nPope.--\"When Reynolds was a young man, he was present at an auction of\r\nvery scarce pictures, which attracted a great crowd of _connoisseurs_\r\nand others; when, in the moment of a very interesting piece being put\r\nup, Mr. Pope entered the room. All was in an instant, from a scene of\r\nconfusion and bustle, a dead calm. The auctioneer, as if by instinct,\r\nsuspended his hammer. The audience, to an individual, as if by the same\r\nimpulse, rose up to receive the poet; and did not resume their seats\r\ntill he had reached the upper end of the room.\"\r\n\r\nA similar honour was paid to the Abbe Raynal, whose reputation was such,\r\nthat the Speaker of the House of Commons observing _him_ among the\r\nspectators, suspended the business of the house till he had seen the\r\neloquent historian placed in a more commodious seat. It is painful to\r\nrelate, that this powerful writer, and good man, who narrowly escaped\r\nthe guillotine, expired in a garret, in extreme poverty, at the age of\r\neighty-four; the only property he left being one assignat of fifty\r\nlivres, worth not threepence in ready money. Perhaps one might have\r\napplied the following anecdote (told by Dr. Drake in his Literary Hours)\r\nto Abbe Raynal:--\"A respectable character, having long figured in the\r\ngay world at Paris, was at length compelled to live in an obscure\r\nretreat in that city, the victim of severe misfortunes. He was so\r\nindigent, that he subsisted only on an allowance from the parish. Every\r\nweek bread was sent to him sufficient for his support, and yet at\r\nlength, he demanded more. On this the curate sent for him. 'Do you live\r\nalone?' said the curate. 'With whom, sir, is it possible I should live?\r\nI am wretched, since I thus solicit charity, and am abandoned by all the\r\nworld.' 'But, sir, if you live alone, why do you ask for more bread than\r\nis sufficient for yourself?' The other at last, with great reluctance,\r\nconfessed that he had a dog. The curate desired him to observe, that he\r\nwas only the distributor of the bread that belonged to the poor, and\r\nthat it was absolutely necessary that he should dispose of his dog. 'Ah,\r\nsir!' exclaimed the poor man, weeping, 'and if I lose my dog, who is\r\nthere then to love me?' The good pastor took his purse, and giving it to\r\nhim, 'take this, sir,' said he; 'this is mine--this I _can_ give.'\"\r\n\r\n[79] How applicable are Gray's lines to Lord Byron himself, now!\r\n\r\n   Can storied urn or animated bust\r\n     Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?\r\n   Can honour's voice provoke the silent dust,\r\n     Or flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of death?\r\n   Perhaps in this _neglected_ spot is laid\r\n     Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire!--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[80] Mr. Bowles, in some stanzas written since the death of Byron, thus\r\nfeelingly apostrophizes his noble spirit:--\r\n\r\n   But I will bid th' Arcadian cypress wave,\r\n     Pluck the green laurel from Peneus' side,\r\n   And pray thy spirit may such quiet have\r\n     That not one thought unkind be murmur'd o'er thy grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[81] Perhaps one motive (no doubt there were numberless others) that\r\n_might_ have induced Mr. Mason thus to honour the memory of Pope,\r\n\r\n   ----_letting cold tears bedew his silver urn_,\r\n\r\n_might_ have been from the recollection of his attachment to what\r\nequally charmed Mr. Mason--the love of gardens.\r\n\r\n[82] I know not whether Milton's portrait should have been here noticed.\r\nIn a note to the eloquent, the talented, and graceful \"Discours\r\nd'Installation, prononce par M. le Vicomte H. de Thury, president de la\r\nSociete d'Horticulture de Paris,\" it is beautifully observed, that\r\n\"Personne n'a mieux decrit ce delicieux jardin que Milton. Les Anglais\r\nregardent comme le type de tous les jardins paysagers, et pittoresques,\r\nla description que fait Milton du jardin d'Eden, et qui atteste que se\r\nsublime genie etoit egalement poete, peintre et paysagiste.\" As I have\r\nsought for the portraits of Mr. George Mason, and of Mr. Whateley, and\r\nhave noticed those of Launcelot Brown, and Mr. Walpole, Mr. Cradock, M.\r\nR. P. Knight and Sir U. Price, who were all _paysagists_; surely our\r\ngreat and severe republican was one.\r\n\r\nThe Prince de Ligne speaks thus of Milton:--\"les vers enchanteurs de ce\r\nRoi des poetes, et des _jardiniers_.\r\n\r\nI do not know that every one will agree with Switzer in the concluding\r\npart of what he says of Milton, in the History of Gardening, prefixed to\r\nhis Iconologia:--\"But although things were in this terrible combustion,\r\nwe must not omit the famous Mr. John Milton, one of Cromwell's\r\nSecretaries; who, by his excellent and never-to-be-equalled poem of\r\nParadise Lost, has particularly distinguished gardening, by taking that\r\nfor his theme; and shows, that though his eyes deprived him of the\r\nbenefit of seeing, yet his mind was wonderfully moved with the\r\nphilosophy, innocence, and beauty of this employ; his books, though\r\nmixed with other subjects, being a kind of a philosophical body of\r\ngardening, as well as divinity. Happy man! _had his pen been employed on\r\nno other subject_.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be needless reminding my reader, that Mr. Walpole's powerful pen\r\nhas taken care that our mighty poet, (who \"on evil days, though fallen,\r\nand with darkness and solitude compassed round,\") shall not be\r\n_defrauded of half his glory_.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to remark, that an edition of Paradise Lost is now\r\nannounced for publication, in which the zeal of its spirited proprietors\r\nhas determined, that every word shall be printed in letters of gold. The\r\nsanction of some of our most distinguished divines, and men of high\r\nrank, evince the pride with which we all acknowledge the devout zeal and\r\nmighty powers of the blind poet.\r\n\r\n[83] Mr. Garrick's fondness for ornamental gardening, induced him finely\r\nto catch at this invention, in his inimitable performance of Lord\r\nChalkstone.\r\n\r\n[84] Dr. Pulteney relates this anecdote of Mr. Miller: \"He was the only\r\nperson I ever knew who remembered to have seen Mr. Ray. I shall not\r\neasily forget the pleasure that enlightened his countenance, it so\r\nstrongly expressed the _Virgilium tantum vidi_, when, in speaking of\r\nthat revered man, he related to me that incident of his youth.\" I regret\r\nthat Mr. Ray only meditated a work to have been entitled _Horti_ Angliae.\r\nHad he written it, I should have felt a singular pride in introducing\r\nhis valued name in the present imperfect volume.\r\n\r\n[85] The generous minded reader will be gratified by referring to the\r\nkind tribute, paid to the memory of Shenstone, by Mr. Loudon, at p. 76\r\nof his Encyclopaedia. Of this Encyclopaedia, Mr. Johnson, in his History\r\nof Gardening, thus speaks:--\"Taken as a whole, it is the most complete\r\nbook of gardening ever published;\"--and that, with the exception of\r\nchymistry, \"every art and science, at all illustrative of gardening, are\r\nmade to contribute their assistance.\"\r\n\r\n[86] In his \"Unconnected Thoughts\" he admires the _Oak_, for \"its\r\nmajestic appearance, the rough grandeur of its bark, and the wide\r\nprotection of its branches: a large, branching, aged oak, is, perhaps,\r\nthe most venerable of all inanimate objects.\"\r\n\r\n[87] Tea was the favourite beverage of Dr. Johnson. When Hanway\r\npronounced his anathema against it, Johnson rose in defence of it,\r\ndeclaring himself \"in that article a hardened sinner, having for years\r\ndiluted my meals with the infusion of that fascinating plant; my\r\ntea-kettle has had no time to cool; with tea I have solaced the midnight\r\nhour, and with tea welcomed the morning.\" Mr. Pennant was a great lover\r\nof tea; a hardy honest Welch parson, on hearing that he usually retired\r\nin the afternoon to his summer-house to enjoy that beverage, was moved\r\nwith indignation, that any thing weaker than ale or wine should be drunk\r\nthere; and calling to mind the good hunting times of old, passionately\r\nexclaimed, \"his father would have scorned it.\"\r\n\r\n[88] Sir Uvedale thus expresses his own sensations when viewing some of\r\nthese plantations:--\"The inside fully answers to the dreary appearance\r\nof the outside; of all dismal scenes it seems to me the most likely for\r\na man to hang himself in; he would, however, find some difficulty in the\r\nexecution, for amidst the endless multitude of stems, there is rarely a\r\nsingle side branch to which a rope could be fastened. The whole wood is\r\na collection of tall naked poles.... Even its gloom is without\r\nsolemnity; it is only dull and dismal; and what light there is, like\r\nthat of hell,\r\n\r\n   _Serves only to discover scenes of woe,\r\n   Regions of sorrow, doleful shades._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[89] This observation confirms what Sir U. Price so pointedly enforces\r\nthroughout the whole of his causticly sportive letter to Mr. Repton:\r\n\"that the best landscape painters would be the best landscape gardeners,\r\nwere they to turn their minds to the practical part; consequently, a\r\nstudy of their works, the most useful study to an improver.\"--And that\r\n\"Van Huysum would be a much better judge of the merits and defects of\r\nthe most dressed scene--of a mere flower garden,--than a gardener.\"\r\n\r\n[90] Mr. Browne was not an author; yet the title of the present volume\r\nis \"On the Portraits of English _Authors_ on Gardening.\" Neither was old\r\nBridgman nor Kent _authors_ on this subject; still I could not prevail\r\non myself to pass over such names in total silence.\r\n\r\n[91] Mr. Clive resided at Moreton-Say, near Market-Drayton. He was a\r\nprebend of Westminster. Integrity marked every action of his life. In\r\nhis village, scarcely a poor man existed. His kindness and benevolence\r\nto the poor, could only be equalled by his friendly hospitality and kind\r\nfeeling to the more affluent in his neighbourhood:\r\n\r\n   _Thy works, and alms, and all thy good endeavour,\r\n   Follow thee up to joy and bliss for ever._\r\n\r\nMiss Seward thus concludes one of her letters to him:--\"I wish none were\r\npermitted to enter the lists of criticism but those who feel poetic\r\nbeauty as keenly as yourself, and who have the same generous desire that\r\nothers should feel it.\" I mention Mr. Clive with gratitude, from a\r\nrecollection of kindnesses received from him at a very early period of\r\nmy life, and which were of such a nature, as could not fail to animate\r\nthe mind of a young man to studious exertions. Archdeacon Plimley (now\r\nthe truly venerable Archdeacon Corbet, and who has been so long an\r\nhonour to his native county), in his Agricultural Survey of Shropshire,\r\nrespectfully introduces Mr. Clive's name; and when he addressed his\r\ncharge to the diocese of Hereford, in 1793, one really cannot but apply\r\nto Mr. Clive, what he so eloquently enforces in that charge to each\r\nclergyman:--\"to cultivate a pure spirit within their own bosoms; to be\r\nin every instance the right-hand neighbour to each parishioner; their\r\nprivate adviser, their public monitor, their example in christian\r\nconduct, their joy in health, their consolation in sickness.\" In the\r\nsame vault with Mr. Archdeacon Clive, lies buried Robert Lord Clive,\r\nconqueror of _Plassy_: on whose death appeared these extempore lines, by\r\na man of distinction, a friend to Lord Clive:--\r\n\r\n   Life's a surface, slippery, glassy,\r\n   Whereon tumbled Clive of Plassy;\r\n   All the wealth the east could give,\r\n   Brib'd not death to let him live:\r\n   There's no distinction in the grave\r\n   'Twixt the nabob and the slave.\r\n\r\nHis lordship's death, in 1774, was owing to the same cause which\r\nhastened that of the most worthy of men, Sir Samuel Romilly--from\r\nshattered and worn out nerves;--from severe study in the latter, and\r\nfrom the burning climate of the east in the former. Had Lord Clive lived\r\na few years longer, he would have enriched the whole neighbourhood round\r\nhis native spot. His vigorous, ardently-gifted, and penetrating mind,\r\nprojected plantations and other improvements, that could only have been\r\nconceived by such minds as Olivier de Serres, or by Sully, or by our own\r\nEvelyn. He was in private life beloved. He was generous, social and\r\nfriendly; and if ever charity to the poor warmed the breast of any\r\nmortal, it warmed that of Lord Clive. Few men had more kind affections\r\nthan Lord Clive.\r\n\r\n[92] The following passage from a favourite book of Dr. Darwin's, (the\r\nSystem of Nature, by Linnaeus) will well apply to that searching and\r\npenetrating mind, which so strongly possessed him through life.--\"How\r\nsmall a part of the great works of nature is laid open to our eyes, and\r\nhow many things are going on in secret which we know nothing of! How\r\nmany things are there which this age first was acquainted with! How many\r\nthings that we are ignorant of will come to light when all memory of us\r\nshall be no more! for nature does not at once reveal all her secrets. We\r\nare apt to look on ourselves as already admitted into the sanctuary of\r\nher temple; we are still only in the porch.\" How full of grace, of\r\ntenderness, and passion, is that elegy, which he composed the night he\r\nfeared a life he so passionately loved (Mrs. Pole, of Radburn,) was in\r\nimminent danger, and when he dreamed she was dead:\r\n\r\n   Stretch'd on her sable bier, the grave beside,\r\n     A snow-white shroud her breathless bosom bound,\r\n   O'er her white brow the _mimic lace_ was tied,\r\n     And loves, and virtues, hung their garlands round.\r\n\r\n   From these cold lips did softest accents flow?\r\n     Round that pale mouth did sweetest dimples play?\r\n   On this dull cheek the rose of beauty blow,\r\n     And those dim eyes diffuse celestial rays?\r\n\r\n   Did this cold hand unasking want relieve,\r\n     Or wake the lyre to every rapturous sound?\r\n   How sad, for other's woes, this breast could heave!\r\n     How light this heart, for other's transport, bound!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[93] It was at this period of his residence at Lichfield, that the\r\npresent writer heard him strongly enforce the cultivation of _papaver\r\nsomniferum_. What he may have also enforced to others, may possibly have\r\ngiven rise to some of those ingenious papers on its cultivation, which\r\nare inserted not only in the Transactions of the Society for the\r\nEncouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce; in other publications,\r\nbut in the first and fifth volumes of the Memoirs of the Caledonian\r\nHorticultural Society. The papers of Mr. Ball and Mr. Jones, on its\r\ncultivation, in the former of these transactions, are particularly\r\ndiffuse and valuable. They are fully noticed in Dr. Thornton's \"Family\r\nHerbal.\" The subjoined plate is a copy of that in the title page to\r\n\"_Opiologia_, ou traicte concernant le naturel proprietes, vraye\r\npreparation, et seur vsage de l'opium,\" a favourite volume with Dr.\r\nDarwin, printed at _la Haye_, 1614, 12mo. Dr. Darwin, in his Botanical\r\nGarden, thus speaks of opium: \"the finest opium is procured by wounding\r\nthe heads of large poppies with a three-edged knife, and tying\r\nmuscle-shells to them, to catch the drops. In small quantities it\r\nexhilirates the mind, raises the passions, and invigorates the body; in\r\nlarge ones, it is succeeded by intoxication, languor, stupor, and\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\n[94] _Sterne_ mentions a traveller who always set out with the spleen\r\nand jaundice,--\"without one generous connection, or pleasurable anecdote\r\nto tell of,--travelling straight on, looking neither to his right hand\r\nor his left, lest love or pity should seduce him out of the road.\" Mr.\r\nLoudon seems to be a very different kind of a traveller: for his\r\nhorticultural spirit and benevolent views, pervade almost every page of\r\nhis late tour through _Bavaria_. One envies his feelings, too, in\r\nanother rural excursion, through the romantic scenery of _Bury_, at Mr.\r\nBarclay's, and of Mr. Hope's at _Deepdene_; and particularly when he\r\npaints his own emotions on viewing the room of sculpture there. He even\r\ncould not, in October last, take his rural ride from _Edgware_ to _St.\r\nAlban's_ without thus awakening in each traveller a love of gardens, and\r\ngiving this gentle hint to an honest landlord:--\"A new inn, in the\r\noutskirts of _St. Alban's_, in the _Dunstable_ road, has an ample\r\ngarden, not made the most of. Such a piece of ground, and a gardener of\r\ntaste, would give an inn, so situated, so great a superiority, that\r\n_every one would be tempted to stop there_; but the garden of this\r\nBoniface, exhibits but the beginning of a good idea.\" When travelling\r\nalong our English roads, his mind no doubt frequently reverts to those\r\nroad-side gardens in the Netherlands, which he thus happily adverts to\r\nin p. 32 of his Encyclopaedia: \"The gardens of the cottagers in these\r\ncountries, are undoubtedly better managed and more productive than those\r\nof any other country; no man who has a cottage is without a garden\r\nattached; often small, but rendered useful to a poor family, by the high\r\ndegree of culture given to it.\" Linnaeus, in his eloquent oration at\r\nUpsal, enforces the pleasure of travelling in one's own country, through\r\nits fields _and roads_. Mr. Heath, the zealous and affectionate\r\nhistorian of Monmouth, in his account of that town and its romantic\r\nneighbourhood, (published in 1804,) omits no opportunity of noticing the\r\nmany neat gardens, which add to the other rural charms of its rich\r\nscenery, thus mentions another Boniface:--\"The late Thomas Moxley, who\r\nkept the public-house at Manson Cross, was a person that took great\r\ndelight in fruit-trees, and had a large piece of ground let him, for the\r\npurpose of planting it with apple-trees; but his death (which followed\r\nsoon after) prevented the plan from being carried to the extent he\r\nintended, though some of the land bears evidence of his zeal and\r\nlabour.\" Mr. Heath cannot even travel on the turnpike road, from\r\nMonmouth to Hereford, without benevolently remarking, that \"a number of\r\nlaborious families have erected small tenements, with a garden to each,\r\nmost of which are thickly planted with apple-trees, whose produce\r\nconsiderably adds to the owner's support.\"\r\n\r\n[95] Of this celebrated biographer of Dr. Darwin (whose Verses to the\r\nMemory of Mr. Garrick, and whose Monody on Captain Cook, will live as\r\nlong as our language is spoken,) Sir W. Scott thus describes his first\r\npersonal interview with:--\"Miss Seward, when young, must have been\r\nexquisitely beautiful; for, in advanced age, the regularity of her\r\nfeatures, the fire and expression of her countenance, gave her the\r\nappearance of beauty, and almost of youth. Her eyes were auburn, of the\r\nprecise shade and hue of her hair, and possessed great expression. In\r\nreciting, or in speaking with animation, they appeared to become darker;\r\nand, as it were, to flash fire. I should have hesitated to state the\r\nimpression which this peculiarity made upon me at the time, had not my\r\nobservation been confirmed by that of the first actress of this or any\r\nother age, with whom I lately happened to converse on our deceased\r\nfriend's expressive powers of countenance.\"\r\n\r\n[96] From one of these pleasing sermons I extract these few\r\nlines:--\"Among the most pleasing sights of a country village, is that of\r\na father and mother, followed by their family of different ages, issuing\r\nfrom their little dwelling on a Sunday morning, as the bell tolls to\r\nchurch. The children, with their ruddy, wholesome looks, are all neat\r\nand clean. Their behaviour at church shews what an impression their\r\nparents have given them of the holiness of the place, and of the duties\r\nthey have to perform. Though unregarded, as they return home, by their\r\nricher neighbours, they carry back with them to their humble cottage the\r\nblessing of God.--Pious parents! lead on your children from church to\r\nheaven. You are in the right road. Your heavenly father sees your\r\nhearts.\"\r\n\r\n[97] Mr. Cradock published in 8vo. in 1777, price 2s. 6d. an account of\r\nsome of the most remarkable places in North Wales.\r\n\r\n[98] Mons. de Voltaire was so charmed with the taste and talents, and\r\npolite engaging manners of La Fage, that he paid him the following\r\ncompliment; which may very justly be applied to Mr. Cradock:\r\n\r\n   _Il recut deux presens des Dieux,\r\n   Les plus charmans qu'ils puissent faire;\r\n   L'un etoit le talent de plaire,\r\n   L'autre le secret d'etre heureux._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[99] The Quarterly Review for April, 1821, observes, that \"The total\r\nnumber of exotics, introduced into this country, appears to be 11,970,\r\nof which the first forty-seven species, including the orange, apricot,\r\npomegranate, &c. were introduced previously or during the reign of Henry\r\nVIII., and no fewer than 6756 in the reign of George III. For this proud\r\naccession to our exotic botany in the last century, the public are\r\nchiefly indebted to Sir Joseph Banks, and Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, of\r\nthe Hammersmith nursery.\"\r\n\r\n[100] The invocation to this Vale, reminds one of Mr. Repton's\r\ndescription:--\"Downton Vale, near Ludlow, one of the most beautiful and\r\nromantic valleys that the imagination can conceive. It is impossible by\r\ndescription to convey an idea of its natural charms, or to do justice to\r\nthat taste which has displayed these charms to the greatest advantage,\r\n\r\n   _With art clandestine, and conceal'd design._\r\n\r\nA narrow, wild, and natural path, sometimes creeps under the beetling\r\nrock, close by the margin of a mountain stream. It sometimes ascends to\r\nan awful precipice, from whence the foaming waters are heard roaring in\r\nthe dark abyss below, or seen wildly dashing against its opposite banks;\r\nwhile, in other places, the course of the river _Teme_ being impeded by\r\nnatural ledges of rock, the vale presents a calm, glassy mirror, that\r\nreflects the surrounding foliage. The path, in various places, crosses\r\nthe water by bridges of the most romantic and contrasted forms; and,\r\nbranching in various directions, including some miles in length, is\r\noccasionally varied and enriched by caves and cells, hovels, and covered\r\nseats, or other buildings, in perfect harmony with the wild but pleasing\r\nhorrors of the scene.\"\r\n\r\n[101] Foxley, this far-famed seat of dignified and benevolent\r\nretirement, has on many occasions become interesting. I will merely\r\nmention one. It gave a peaceful asylum to Benjamin Stillingfleet, when\r\nhis mind was depressed by disappointment. The then owner, Robert Price,\r\nEsq. and his mild and amiable lady, both kindly pressed him to become an\r\ninmate of their domestic retreat, that his health might be restored, and\r\nhis mind calmed; and though he modestly refused being a constant\r\nintruder, yet he took up his residence in a cottage near them, and\r\ndelighted to pass his leisure hours in their happy domestic circle,\r\n\"blending his studious pursuits, with rural occupations,\" and\r\nparticularly with gardening. No doubt, to this protecting kindness, may,\r\non this spot, have been imbibed his great veneration for Theophrastus;\r\nand here he must have laid the foundation of those attainments, which,\r\nduring the future periods of his life, obtained for him the high\r\napprobation of the justly celebrated Mrs. Montagu, who, in her letters,\r\nspeaks of \"this invaluable friend,\" in the highest possible terms of\r\npraise. In this peaceful and consoling retreat, was written his original\r\nand masterly tribute to the talents of Xenophon; and here was first\r\nkindled his deep enthusiastic zeal for the classic authors of antiquity;\r\nand the materials for his then intended edition of Milton (who he says\r\nequalled all the ancients whom he imitated; the sublimity of Homer, the\r\nmajesty of Sophocles, the softness of Theocritus, and the gaiety of\r\nAnacreon,) enriched with parallel passages from holy writ, the classics,\r\nand the early Italian poets; and here he composed his matchless treatise\r\non the power and principles of Tartini's music (for it seems Mr. Price\r\nhimself \"was a master of the art.\") Here too, most probably, he\r\nsketched, or first gathered, his early memoranda towards his future\r\ngeneral history of husbandry, from the earliest ages of the world to his\r\nown time; and fostered a devoted zeal for Linnaeus, which produced that\r\nspirited eulogium on him, which pervades the preface to his translation\r\nof \"Miscellaneous Tracts on Natural History.\"\r\n\r\n[102] Sir Uvedale, about fifty years ago, translated _Pausanias_ from\r\nthe Greek. One may judge of the feeling with which he dwelt on the pages\r\nof this book, by what he says of that nation in vol. i. p. 65 of his\r\nEssays, where he speaks of being struck with the extreme richness of\r\nsome of the windows of our cathedrals and ruined abbeys: \"I hope it will\r\nnot be supposed, that by admiring the picturesque circumstances of the\r\nGothic, I mean to undervalue the symmetry and beauty of Grecian\r\nbuildings: whatever comes to us from the Greeks, has an irresistible\r\nclaim to our admiration; that distinguished people seized on the true\r\npoints both of beauty and grandeur in all the arts, and their\r\narchitecture has justly obtained the same high pre-eminence as their\r\nsculpture, poetry, and eloquence.\"\r\n\r\n[103] On the pomp of devotion in our ancient abbeys, Mr. R. P. Knight\r\nthus interests his readers, in the chapter \"Of the Sublime and\r\nPathetic,\" in the Inquiry into the principles of Taste:--\"Every person\r\nwho has attended the celebration of high mass, at any considerable\r\necclesiastical establishment, must have felt how much the splendour and\r\nmagnificence of the Roman Catholic worship tends to exalt the spirit of\r\ndevotion, and to inspire the soul with rapture and enthusiasm. Not only\r\nthe impressive melody of the vocal and instrumental music, and the\r\nimposing solemnity of the ceremonies, but the pomp and brilliancy of the\r\nsacerdotal garments, and the rich and costly decorations of the altar,\r\nraise the character of religion, and give it an air of dignity and\r\nmajesty unknown to any of the reformed churches.\"\r\n\r\n[104] In p. 130 and 179 of vol. ii. he thus adverts to the effects of\r\nthe levelling system of Launcelot Browne:--\"From this influence of\r\nfashion, and the particular influence of Mr. Browne, models of old\r\ngardens are in this country still scarcer in nature than in painting;\r\nand therefore what good parts there may be in such gardens, whether\r\nproceeding from original design, or from the changes produced by time\r\nand accident, can no longer be observed; and yet, from these specimens\r\nof ancient art, however they may be condemned as old fashioned, many\r\nhints might certainly be taken, and blended with such modern\r\nimprovements as really deserve the name.\"--\"Were my arguments in favour\r\nof many parts of the old style of gardening ever so convincing, the most\r\nI could hope from them at present, would be, to produce _some caution_;\r\nand to assist in preserving some of the few remains of old magnificence\r\nthat still exist, by making the owner less ready to listen to a\r\nprofessor, whose interest it is to recommend total demolition.\" Mr. R.\r\nP. Knight, in a note to his _landscape_, thus remarks on this subject:\r\n\"I remember a country clock-maker, who being employed to clean a more\r\ncomplex machine than he had been accustomed to, very confidently took it\r\nto pieces; but finding, when he came to put it together again, some\r\nwheels of which he could not discover the use, very discreetly carried\r\nthem off in his pocket. The simple artifice of this prudent mechanic,\r\nalways recurs to my mind, when I observe the manner in which our modern\r\nimprovers repair and embellish old places; not knowing how to employ the\r\nterraces, mounds, avenues, and other features which they find there,\r\nthey take them all away, and cover the places which they occupied with\r\nturf. It is a short and easy method of proceeding; and if their\r\nemployers will be satisfied with it, they are not to be blamed for\r\npersevering in it, as it may be executed by proxy, as well as in\r\nperson.\"\r\n\r\nSeverely (and no doubt justly), as the too generally smooth and\r\nmonotonous system of Mr. Browne has been condemned, yet he must have had\r\ngreat merit to have obtained the many encomiums he did obtain from some\r\nof our first nobility and gentry. The _evil_ which he did in many of\r\ntheir altered pleasure-grounds, _lives after him--the good is oft\r\ninterred in his grave_.\r\n\r\n[105] Mr. George Mason justly observes that \"Nature's favourite haunts\r\nare the school of gardening.\"\r\n\r\n[106] Dion. Chrysostom said of Xenophon, that \"he had something of\r\nwitchcraft in his writings.\" It would not be too much to say the same of\r\nthis poet.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n_Printed by Lowe and Harvey, Playhouse Yard, Blackfriars._",
