The chief aim of their authors seems to have been to\r\ncombine brevity with comprehensiveness. Brevity is, without doubt, a\r\ngreat advantage, inasmuch as the proverb is true, that a great book\r\nis a great evil; but in my opinion comprehensiveness ought not to be\r\nattempted in books intended for children. If it were desirable, I\r\nmight indeed confidently say, that it can never be obtained within\r\nthe necessary limits; and the attempt to effect it, will very often\r\nreduce the work to a mere dry table of classification. However neat and\r\nsystematic tables of genera and species, and lists of names may look,\r\nthey can never convey to the young the elements of sound scientific\r\nmethod; and will seldom fail in being useless or disgusting to the\r\nmind, at an age when it is seeking for that sort of knowledge which\r\nwill exercise the understanding, without burdening the memory. This\r\nhealthy appetite ought to be carefully cultivated; and I am satisfied\r\nthat if it were so, from the earliest stage of education, we should\r\nhave but few complaints of bad memories. The memory is apt to vanish\r\nfrom those who would make an idol of it; and I am disposed to think\r\nthat its cultivation may very safely be omitted, as a direct object\r\nof education, if due care is taken to keep the understanding active,\r\nand to present the matter on which it is to be engaged in the most\r\nentertaining form possible. In fact, what is often termed \"a good\r\nmemory,\" that is, a ready recollection independent of the connections\r\nwhich are made solely by the understanding, is, as we may see by its\r\nfruits in many persons of feeble intellect, by no means desirable. An\r\napt example of such a memory is afforded, in what Dame Quickly says\r\nto Sir John Falstaff, when she reminds him of a mixed multitude of\r\nunimportant circumstances, with no other principle of arrangement or\r\nconnection, than what was supplied by proximity of time and place.\r\n\r\nI would not, however, willingly be supposed to recommend books,\r\nin which systematic arrangement, or the most scrupulous regard to\r\naccurate statement, is overlooked. I had particularly in view that\r\nnumerous class of little books, which under various names come out in\r\nseries, each volume professing in a manner to comprise _the whole_\r\nof the branch of Natural History which may be the subject of it, by\r\nits containing a mere arrangement of the names of the phenomena which\r\nthe branch includes. There is another and widely different class of\r\nbooks, in which stories from travellers and other idle gossip of the\r\nlike kind, are compiled in an undigested mass, without regard to\r\nthe different names by which the same thing may be called, and not\r\nunfrequently to a common respect for truth, which is not much less to\r\nbe deprecated.\r\n\r\nAnd yet to books of this latter description, often of a very\r\nunworthy character, it is that many of us owe the first calling into\r\nconsciousness of that taste which may have made us travellers or\r\nnaturalists, or lovers of knowledge. I wish that, without copying the\r\nexample of their authors, we should learn a lesson from them, and put\r\nit in practice, by striving to form a taste to enjoy knowledge in them\r\nwe have to teach, before we attempt any mode of systematic instruction.\r\n\r\nThe following little book has been written under the impressions\r\nwhich I have here stated. I have selected a few of such phenomena\r\nof the Kingdoms of Nature, as seemed to me to have in them most to\r\nexcite wonder and admiration; and I have sought to convey distinct\r\nnotions with the least possible use of technical language; neither\r\nforgetting the connection of things, nor overloading the statements\r\nwith matters that are merely expletive of an arbitrary system. How far\r\nI may have succeeded, is for my little friends, and their instructors,\r\nwho have approved of my other books, to decide. Wishing the former as\r\nmuch pleasure in the reading, as I have had, for their sakes, in the\r\nwriting, I take my leave of them.\r\n\r\n  P.

A great number of them I\r\nhave seen myself in my travels through various countries, and others I\r\nhave only read of; but I shall tell you nothing that is not strictly\r\ntrue, for I do not wish so much to astonish you as to make you take\r\npleasure in contemplating the works of God, and to increase your\r\nknowledge of His goodness, wisdom, and power.\r\n\r\nI shall begin with some of the wonders of the earth which, as I suppose\r\nyou know, belong to the branch of natural history which is called\r\ngeology; and to enable you to understand what follows, I must first\r\nexplain how the materials which compose the ground you tread upon are\r\narranged.\r\n\r\nIf you hastily travel over any extensive tract of country, such as that\r\nbetween New York and Philadelphia, or between London and Bristol, you\r\nmight think that all the different substances, clay, chalk, limestone,\r\nand granite, were irregularly mixed together. This is, however, not\r\nthe case, when taken on a great scale; for if you more carefully\r\nexamine, you will find that the various sorts of earth are disposed in\r\nlayers, or _strata_, and that a uniform order of arrangement is nearly\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nIf these layers were perfectly horizontal, laid one over another like\r\nthe coats of an onion, we should have to dig through one before we\r\ncould get to the second, and our knowledge of what the globe consists,\r\nwould be much more limited than it is; for the greatest depth to which\r\nmen have descended in the deepest mines, is not much greater than the\r\nthickness of one of the strata.\r\n\r\nBut, instead of this, the surface is broken up by some force from\r\nbeneath elevating portions, so as to form mountains and hills; and in\r\nconsequence of this the edges of the strata appear on the surface one\r\nafter another; just as you would see the edges of a row of bricks that\r\nhad been set up on their ends, and then the last one thrown down so as\r\nto push down all the others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis is the way in which the strata are placed in the neighbourhood of\r\nWeymouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe chief reason why I wished you to understand this is, that you\r\nmay see how it is known that one stratum is older than another. It\r\nis evident that the substance marked _a_, in the section, which\r\nis limestone, must have been deposited before _b_, while _b_ must\r\ncertainly be older than _c_.\r\n\r\nNow in most of the strata above the granite, which is nearly always in\r\nthe position of the oldest formation, there are found various shells,\r\nplants, and bones of animals; and where certain remains of different\r\nanimals or vegetables are found in one stratum, it is concluded that\r\nthey must have been living about the same time.\r\n\r\nMost of the animals of the older strata were different in form from any\r\nat present known to exist; and some of them are very remarkable, and if\r\nthey were alive now, would seem to us very strange and awkward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I\r\n\r\nEXTINCT ANIMALS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWHAT CREATURES ONCE LIVED WHERE DORSETSHIRE NOW IS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will show you a picture of what creatures were once living where the\r\ntown of Lyme Regis, in Dorsetshire, now stands, and tell you something\r\nabout their structure and their habits. You may perhaps be ready to\r\nthink that a great deal of what we profess to know concerning them,\r\nis the work of fancy, but I can assure you it is not, and by and by I\r\nwill endeavour to convince you that there is reason enough for you to\r\nbelieve what I tell you.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ICHTHYOSAURUS.\r\n\r\nThat large animal lying on the ground, is called the _Icthyosaurus_,\r\nfrom two Greek words signifying _Fish-Lizard_, in consequence of his\r\npossessing some of the peculiarities of both fishes and lizards.\r\n\r\nThe usual length of this creature was from twenty to thirty feet. It\r\npossessed a most surprising combination of the powers and qualities of\r\ndifferent animals which are now in existence. In its general form and\r\ncharacter it must have been something like the modern porpoise; but it\r\nhad the teeth of a crocodile, the head of a lizard, the back-bone of a\r\nfish, and the fins or _paddles_, of a whale.\r\n\r\nI shall spend some little time in explaining to you each of these\r\nparticulars, that you may see how wisely all the parts of living things\r\nare framed to supply their wants, and adapt them to the circumstances\r\nin which they are placed.\r\n\r\nThe head was not very different from that of a crocodile, or lizard, in\r\nits general shape. The teeth were precisely like those of a crocodile,\r\nand grew up in the same manner. Creatures of this sort lead a ruffian\r\nsort of life, always biting something or other, and as they live very\r\nmuch in the dark at the bottom of the water, perhaps now and then snap\r\nat a stone or a piece of hard wood by mistake, and often break their\r\nteeth; and in order therefore to keep them in constant repair, they\r\nhave a fresh set once a year, or at very short intervals, so that they\r\nare always growing. The young tooth _a_, springs up inside the old one\r\n_b_, till it becomes so large that it splits its predecessor, and the\r\npieces fall off, just as the covering of some sorts of buds falls off\r\nas the flower expands, as you will see in this cut, representing one of\r\nthe fossil teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYou must have noticed in the picture the great length of his snout.\r\nIn a jaw-bone of such amazing length which was to be applied to such\r\nviolent purposes, it was necessary there should be great strength.\r\nThere were two ways of obtaining this: one would have been by having\r\nthe bones very hard and stout; but this would not do, because they\r\nwould then have been so heavy that the animal would have found\r\ndifficulty in raising his head to the surface of the water for the\r\npurpose of breathing, since it would have overbalanced the other part\r\nof his body. The other contrivance, which was the one adopted by the\r\nwisdom of the Creator, was to make the jaws consist of several thin\r\nbones, _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, strongly bound together, and terminating in\r\nsuccession like the plates of steel of which a carriage spring is made.\r\nThere are accordingly six of these bones thus disposed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut this was not all, the principal middle bone marked _b_, instead\r\nof having its fibres run straight, parallel with the others, had them\r\nplaced in a slanting position, and thus there was additional firmness\r\ngiven to the jaw by what ship-builders would call _diagonal bracing_, a\r\ncontrivance that you may often see used in the construction of houses\r\nand ships.\r\n\r\nIf you have ever seen a crocodile open its mouth, and then snap\r\ntogether its long thin jaws, so as to make you start with the noise,\r\nyou will see how necessary all these contrivances must be for him and\r\nthe Icthyosaurus, whose jaws were still thinner, to prevent them from\r\nbreaking their bones.\r\n\r\nThis however is not at all more wonderful than the eye, which in the\r\nold-fashioned animal I have been describing, was much larger than that\r\nof the crocodile, and not unfrequently bigger than a man's head. From\r\nthe very great quantity of light which such a large surface would\r\nreceive, the creature's power of seeing must have been very great. And\r\nbesides this advantage, it had the same faculty as is possessed by the\r\ngolden eagle, the turtle, the tortoise, and the lizard, of pressing the\r\neye forward to render it more convex. In man and most animals, the eye\r\nis placed in a fixed cavity of thin bone, something like an egg-cup,\r\nbut in the Icthyosaurus, the cavity was formed by several bones not\r\nquite touching each other; (as you may see in the last cut, and in\r\nfigure 2, you have two of the bones by themselves, taken out of the\r\nsocket of the eye;) and there were muscles to draw these bones closer\r\ntogether; so that by making the cup less deep, the eye was thrust\r\nforward and made to swell out in the middle. This is illustrated in\r\nthe ball _b_, which is pressed outwards, by drawing the plates of bone\r\n_cc_, together at _o_, close than those which have the ball _a_ between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYou must have seen that the more convex magnifying glasses are, the\r\nmore they magnify, and the nearer you must hold them to the object you\r\nare looking at. By this contrivance, the eye of the Icthyosaurus could\r\nbe made at pleasure into a microscope, so as to see with wonderful\r\nquickness things which were quite close to it, by pushing it forward\r\nand rendering it more convex; or it could be made into a telescope like\r\nthe eyes of some persons who are long-sighted, for seeing what is at a\r\ngreater distance, by drawing it back.\r\n\r\nIn all these particulars you may see how the skill of man leads him\r\nto adopt the same plans to produce the same ends in the works of\r\nart, as God has adopted before him in the works of nature, without\r\nhis being conscious of copying them; and this should remind you that\r\nman was created in the image of his Maker. If man had never made a\r\ncarriage-spring, or a diagonal bracing, he would not have understood\r\nthe structure of the jaw of the Icthyosaurus; and if he had never\r\ninvented the telescope, he would not have been able to explain the\r\nconstruction of the eye.\r\n\r\nYou have now seen the points in which the Icthyo-saurus chiefly\r\nresembled a crocodile or lizard; from which the latter half of its name\r\nis derived, _saurus_, _a lizard_. I must now tell you something of\r\nthose parts in which it is like a fish, from which it takes the other\r\npart of its name, _icthy_, for _icthus_, a fish.\r\n\r\nYou know that crocodiles live a good part of their time on land, and\r\nthey therefore have feet and a back-bone like land animals, which\r\nenable them to walk better, but do not allow them to swim so well as\r\nfish. The back-bone is heavy and firm, and each of the bones composing\r\nit has one side slightly hollow, and the other side swelling out to\r\nfit into the hollow in the one that comes next to it. But in fish both\r\nsides of the bones are hollow, and they are joined together by gristle,\r\nas you can easily see in the fish that are commonly eaten; this renders\r\nthe back-bone much more flexible and lighter, and therefore better\r\nadapted for an animal always swimming. That of the Icthyosaurus was\r\nformed in the same manner, and we therefore judge that he spent his\r\nwhole life in the water; for a back-bone so formed, would not have been\r\nable to support such a great heavy body when walking on the land.\r\n\r\nThe fins, or paddles, were very curious, and much like those of the\r\nwhale; they consisted of above a hundred small bones strongly united\r\ntogether, in a sort of pavement enclosed in a strong skin, and not\r\ndivided into toes, as you may observe in this representation of the\r\nentire skeleton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYou may see many specimens of the skeleton itself in the British\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nThe Icthyosaurus was a great tyrant, and used to prey on every creature\r\nthat came within his reach; this is known by the fossil remains\r\nfound in the inside of his body. He used at times even to act the\r\ncannibal, and eat his own relations, for a large one has been dug out\r\nof the cliff at Lyme Regis, with part of a small one in his stomach\r\nundigested; he must have been altogether a very unamiable character.\r\nBut as his family has been so long extinct, and we are told that we\r\nought to say nothing but what is good concerning the dead, I shall not\r\nsay any more about him, leaving you to form your own conclusions from\r\nwhat I have related to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLESIOSAURUS.\r\n\r\nThose still more strange looking animals with very long necks, which\r\nare represented swimming in the water, have been named _Plesiosauri_, a\r\nword signifying, _related to_, or _closely resembling_, a lizard. There\r\nare some nearly perfect specimens in the British Museum, and this is a\r\nrepresentation made up by taking the uninjured parts of several, so as\r\nto make up a perfect whole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTaking it altogether, there is not one of the fossil animals so much\r\nunlike anything at present known to exist. Its usual length was from 9\r\nto 15 feet, but it was at times very much larger.\r\n\r\nThe head was much shorter in proportion than that of the Icthyosaurus,\r\nbeing more like that of the guana, the lizard which people eat in the\r\nWest Indies. The neck must have been longer than that of any living\r\nanimal, not even excepting the swan; it contained thirty-three bones,\r\nor _vertebræ_, while the whole of the rest of the back-bone in the body\r\nand tail, contained only fifty-seven.\r\n\r\nThe faces of these vertebræ were nearly flat, and not hollow like those\r\nof the Icthyosaurus, which would better enable the animal to exist on\r\nland, and it appears to have moved about in the same manner as seals\r\ndo. From some very ingenious observations on certain parts of its\r\nanatomy, (which if I were to endeavour to explain to you, you would not\r\nunderstand, unless you possessed a great deal of anatomical knowledge,)\r\nnaturalists have supposed that it used to change the colour of its skin\r\nlike the chameleon. Its paddles were almost exactly like those of the\r\nturtle, and its body was something of the same shape, but not quite so\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nFrom its long neck, which, although it was strengthened by the solid\r\njoints and peculiar shapes of the bones, was not very strong, and\r\nits small head and jaws, the Plesiosaurus could not have been near a\r\nmatch for its neighbour, the Icthyosaurus, in combat, even when the\r\nindividuals were of the same size; neither would its form adapt it for\r\ncutting through the water so quickly. It must, therefore, no doubt,\r\nhave often fallen a prey to that voracious monster. Perhaps, however,\r\nit often played him a trick when he was pursuing it by running on shore\r\nout of his reach; or it might mostly have kept out of his way in very\r\nshallow water amongst the rushes and reeds, where it could every now\r\nand then dart its long neck like a swan, down at the little fish that\r\ncame near it; or else suddenly reaching aloft into the air, it may have\r\nseized upon some unlucky insect, or Pterodactyle, (a sort of bat of\r\nwhich I shall presently speak) and then laid down as quiet under the\r\nrushes as if nothing had happened, waiting for its next mouthful.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PTERODACTYLE.\r\n\r\nThat odd-looking creature which is flying in the air over the heads of\r\nthe Plesiosauri, has been called the Pterodactyle, which signifies\r\n_wing-fingered_. There were several varieties, of different sizes and\r\nfigures, from that of a snipe to that of a raven. The most remarkable\r\nof them was indeed a curious creature, and so you will say if you look\r\nat the picture of his skeleton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe was more like a bat in his general shape and habits, than anything\r\nelse we know of, but was very different in a great many respects.\r\n\r\nHe had a head like a lizard, with a long snout and sharp teeth; his\r\nribs were round and thread-like, not flat like those of birds and bats;\r\nhis eyes were large; and his wings like a bat's, being a membrane or\r\nskin, stretched out by one very long toe on each of his fore-feet. In\r\norder to support his long head, there were strong cords running down\r\neach side of the vertebræ of his neck, such as are found in some modern\r\nbirds, as is known by the forms of the bones to which the ends of them\r\nwere attached. His toes ended in sharp claws, and he had also claws at\r\nhis two principal joints, so that he could catch hold of the branches\r\nof trees with them, as bats do. These creatures used principally to\r\nfeed upon large dragon flies, beetles, and the other insects, of which\r\nthe remains are found, and some of which are represented in the picture.\r\n\r\nThere were also living at the same time with these creatures, several\r\nkinds of tortoises, and fish in immense varieties. The whole district\r\nwhere the south coast of England now is, seems to have then been a\r\nmarsh with no vegetation but sea-weeds, reeds, and the like; and its\r\nonly inhabitants were, fish, reptiles, and insects.\r\n\r\nAfter the races of animals which we have mentioned, became extinct,\r\na period followed in which they were succeeded by some monstrous\r\ncreatures, like lizards in all respects, except that they were fitted\r\nto live in the water by the construction of their back-bone, their\r\nhaving lungs of the same kind as those of fishes, and the possession of\r\nfins. One of these, called the Iguanodon, was sometimes seventy feet\r\nlong. It had a little horn near the end of its snout, placed something\r\nlike the horn of a rhinoceros, and must have borne considerable\r\nresemblance in its general form to the guana, which I mentioned before.\r\nTheir bones and teeth, are found at Lewes, in Sussex, and in the Isle\r\nof Wight, where you may pick them up on the shore, as you can the bones\r\nof Icthyosauri and Plesiosauri, at Lyme Regis, though not in such great\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted for a great deal of what I have told you about the\r\nanimals that once lived where Dorsetshire is now, to a lady, Miss\r\nAnning, who spends nearly her whole time in collecting fossils out of\r\nthe cliffs. No one ought to go near Lyme Regis without visiting her\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.\r\n\r\nEXTINCT ANIMALS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWHAT SORT OF A PLACE ONCE EXISTED WHERE THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF PARIS IS\r\nNOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall show you a picture representing a state of things much more\r\nlike the present, than the one we looked at before. It existed at a\r\nlater period, though still a great many years ago; and if you wish to\r\nknow why we conclude it to be later, since it is the other side of\r\nthe water and we are therefore prevented from distinctly tracing the\r\nsuccession of the strata, I will tell you.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the formations of Dorsetshire, in which the great\r\n_saurian_ or lizard-like reptiles are found, we come to chalk in\r\nHampshire and the Isle of Wight; and after the chalk, to some beds of\r\nclay, and then some beds of limestone. The formations above the chalk,\r\nare those called _tertiary_; those from the chalk down to the lowest\r\ncontaining animal and vegetable remains, are the _secondary_; and all\r\nbelow that, consisting mainly of various sorts of granite, are the\r\n_primary_.\r\n\r\nNow all this occurs in the same order in France, and the neighbourhood\r\nof Paris consisting of tertiary formations, just corresponds with\r\nthe tertiary strata of the Isle of Wight, and them we know to be\r\nmore recent than the secondary formations of Dorsetshire. Of course,\r\ntherefore, the animals found at Paris, must be more recent than those\r\nfound at Lyme Regis.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the animals represented in the plate, is called the\r\nPalæotherium.\r\n\r\nThe following is a picture of his skeleton, as it has been made out,\r\nbone by bone. A single tooth was first discovered, and the French\r\nnaturalist, Cuvier, was able to determine from this alone, a great many\r\nparticulars which have now been proved by the subsequent discovery\r\nof the bones; such was the knowledge he had acquired by comparing\r\nthe bones of different animals. He thus discovered that a certain\r\nshape of tooth always accompanied a certain shape of foot, as well as\r\nindicated what kind of food the animal lived upon. From this might be\r\njudged a great deal about the organs of digestion, and the internal\r\nstructure, and something of its habits and disposition. In all these\r\npoints and several others, Cuvier predicted from a single bone of the\r\nPalæotherium, what has been exactly confirmed by the entire skeleton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt was about the size of a small horse, and must have possessed a\r\nlittle trunk, or proboscis, like the modern Tapir, to which indeed it\r\nmust have borne a great resemblance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: American Tapir.]\r\n\r\nThe reason for thinking that it had a trunk, is because there is a\r\npeculiar contrivance in the bones to give strength to the neck, which\r\nonly exists in animals that have a proboscis. There are some Tapirs in\r\nthe Zoological Gardens, and if you have seen them, you will be able to\r\nform a pretty good notion of what the Palæotherium must have been. It\r\nhad perhaps rather more of the hog about it, than the Tapir has, with a\r\nmore dull heavy expression of countenance.\r\n\r\nThere were three varieties of Palæotherium distinguished by their size.\r\nThe smallest was not much larger than a little dog, and you may see the\r\nfigure of one of them in the picture, going down to the water to drink.\r\n\r\nThe more slender animal, which is walking towards the water, is the\r\nAnoplotherium, or un-armed beast. Its size varied from that of a hare,\r\nto that of a large dog; it had a very thick tail like that of the\r\nKangaroo. Everything about it would lead one to suppose that it was a\r\ntimid creature, whose swiftness and agility would protect it against\r\nstronger animals; not unlike in disposition to the antelope, or the\r\nhare of our times.\r\n\r\nAnother animal was living at the same period, which I must describe\r\nto you, as it was, as far as we know, the largest quadruped that ever\r\nlived upon the earth, and in some respects the most remarkable. It was\r\ncalled the Dinotherium, or _terrible wild beast_, and you will soon\r\nknow how well it deserved this name. The individual of which a part of\r\nthe head is now in the British Museum, must have been eighteen feet\r\nlong in the body, and proportionally large! If you compare this size\r\nwith that of the largest elephant you have ever seen, you will be able\r\nto form some notion of his enormous magnitude.\r\n\r\nIn his general form he somewhat resembled the Tapirs, but by no means\r\nso nearly as did the Palæotherium. He had a much longer trunk; and his\r\nshoulder blade is formed like that of the mole, by which we know that\r\nhe must have used his feet in digging. It seems almost certain that\r\nhe was amphibious: and the back part of his skull has a remarkable\r\nsimilarity to that of the whale, and cetaceous fishes in general.\r\nBut the most striking peculiarity in the bones which remain of this\r\nmonster, is the existence of two large tusks bending down from the\r\nlower jaw, like two hooks, as you may see represented in this cut, of\r\nthe head preserved in the Museum. His legs were probably rather short,\r\nand might have borne nearly the same proportion to his body, as those\r\nof the Hippopotamus do to his. From all we can collect, this must have\r\nbeen his general form and appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere can be but little doubt that he was of a savage disposition and\r\nlead a sulky sort of life divided between the water and the land, like\r\nthe Hippopotamus. His great tusks must have rendered him a formidable\r\nenemy; but as we know that he was a digging animal, it is very likely\r\nthat he more frequently used them as a sort of pickaxe, to grub up\r\nsuch roots as he wanted to eat, for he lived wholly upon vegetables.\r\nHe might also have employed them (as Dr. Buckland has conjectured), to\r\nstick into the banks of rivers to support his head above water, and to\r\nanchor himself so as not to be carried down by the stream, while his\r\nhuge body lay in his favourite element: or it does not seem unlikely\r\nthat he might at times have hooked them on to the lower boughs of\r\ntrees, to sustain himself while he plucked down from above the fruit\r\nand foliage with his trunk.\r\n\r\nHis bones have been found in various parts of France, Germany and\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\nWhen these animals were living, the climate must have been very\r\nmuch warmer than it is at present in France, for their bones are\r\nfound associated with palm trees, and other vegetable remains of hot\r\nclimates, and the bones of crocodiles, tortoises, and other creatures\r\nwhich only live in warm regions. The isle of Sheppey consists chiefly\r\nof land which was deposited about the same time, and it contains\r\na great quantity of fossil coffee, and similar plants at present\r\nrestricted to the East and West Indies, and countries near the equator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nOF GREAT CAVERNS IN ENGLAND, AND GERMANY, CONTAINING BONES OF WILD\r\nANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn several parts of England there are great caverns in limestone and\r\nother rocks, which contain an immense quantity of the bones of such\r\nanimals as are now found only in wild countries with warm climates.\r\nOne of the most celebrated of these caves, is that of Kirkdale, in\r\nYorkshire. Of the bones which most of them contain, three-fourths and\r\nupwards belong to bears, of a sort no longer to be found in the living\r\nstate. One-half, or perhaps two-thirds, of the remaining fourth, have\r\nbeen traced to a species of hyæna, which is also unknown at the present\r\nday. A smaller number may be referred to a sort of tiger or lion, and\r\nto some species of the wolf or dog family. The smallest specimens are\r\nof various small flesh-eating animals, such as the fox, the polecat,\r\nand other kindred species. There are also in some of them bones of the\r\nElephant, Rhinoceros, and Hippopotamus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.\r\n\r\nCAVE OF GAYLENREUTH]\r\n\r\nBut the largest and most remarkable of these caves, is at Gaylenreuth,\r\nin Germany, of which the picture represents a section. You will\r\nunderstand this representation, if you read the following account of it\r\nby Dr. Buckland, the Professor of Geology, in the University of Oxford.\r\n\r\n\"The first grotto turns to the right, and is upwards of 80 feet long.\r\nIt is divided into four parts by the unequal heights of the vaulted\r\nroof; the first three are from 15 to 20 feet high; whereas, the fourth\r\nis only from 4 to 5. On the bottom of this part, and on a level with\r\nthe floor, there is an orifice only two feet high, which leads into\r\nthe second grotto. This runs first southward for 60 feet, being 40\r\nwide and 18 high; it then turns to the west through a space of 70 feet,\r\nbecoming gradually lower till its altitude is only 5 feet. The passage\r\nto the third grotto is very incommodious, winding through several\r\ncorridors. It is thirty feet wide, and only five or six high. The loam\r\nof the floor is stuffed full of teeth and jaw-bones. Near the entrance\r\nto it, is a gulf of 15 or 20 feet, into which visitors descend by a\r\nladder. After going down, they arrive at a vault 15 feet diameter by\r\n30 feet in height; and on the side on which they descend, is a grotto\r\nall bestrewed with bones. By going down a little further still, they\r\nfall in with a new arcade which conducts to a grotto 40 feet long, and\r\na new gulf 18 or 20 feet deep. Even after this descent, another cavern\r\npresents itself 40 feet high, quite covered with bones. A passage now\r\nof 5 feet by 7 leads to a grotto 25 feet long and 12 wide; then alleys,\r\n20 feet long, conduct into another cave 20 feet high; and finally,\r\na grand grotto expands, 83 feet in width, and 24 in height, more\r\ncopiously furnished with bones than any of the rest. The sixth and\r\nlast grotto runs in a northerly direction, so that the whole series of\r\ncaverns and corridors, describes nearly a semicircle.\r\n\r\n\"A rift in the third grotto, disclosed in 1784, a new grotto, 15 feet\r\nlong by 4 wide, where the greatest number of hyænas' and lions' bones\r\nwere found. The opening was much too narrow to have allowed these\r\nanimals to have entered by it. A peculiar tunnel which terminated in\r\nthis small grotto, afforded an incredible number of bones, and large\r\nskulls quite entire.\"\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that these caves were inhabited by the fierce animals\r\nwhose bones they contain, and that the other more peaceable creatures\r\nwere dragged in by them for prey, since their bones have evidently been\r\ngnawed and crushed as they would be by fierce and powerful carnivorous\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nOF OTHER ANIMALS THAT ONCE LIVED IN ENGLAND AND ELSEWHERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELEPHANT.\r\n\r\nI have before mentioned to you the bones of Elephants, as occurring in\r\nthe bone caverns; they were, however, not just like the Elephants now\r\nliving in Africa and Asia. The tusks seem to have been larger, and the\r\nhead not quite so broad and blunt; the teeth were also different.\r\n\r\nThere are not perhaps many counties in England in which some of these\r\nremains have not been found, and generally not far below the surface of\r\nthe soil. About London, and at Woolwich in particular, a great many\r\nspecimens of the fossil tusks have been collected; they are chiefly of\r\nabout the consistency of chalk, but if you break them across and look\r\nat the end, you can see the grain of the ivory, just as you do on a\r\nbilliard-ball, or at the end of a knife-handle.\r\n\r\nBefore anatomy was understood so well as it is at present, the bones of\r\nthe Elephant, and those of several other large extinct animals, were\r\nconfounded together under the name of Mammoth. There is a remarkable\r\naccount of the discovery of what was at the time called a Mammoth, (but\r\nwhich was, doubtless, an Elephant,) imbedded in ice in Siberia, which\r\nI shall relate to you, as it is very well written and of undoubted\r\nveracity.\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1799, a Tungusian fisherman observed a strange shapeless\r\nmass projecting from an ice-bank, near the mouth of a river in the\r\nnorth of Siberia, the nature of which he did not understand, and which\r\nwas so high in the bank as to be beyond his reach. He next year\r\nobserved the same object, which was then rather more disengaged from\r\namong the ice; but was still unable to conceive what it was. Towards\r\nthe end of the following summer, 1801, he could distinctly see that\r\nit was the frozen carcass of an enormous animal, the entire flank of\r\nwhich, and one of its tusks, had become disengaged from the ice. In\r\nconsequence of the ice beginning to melt earlier, and to a greater\r\ndegree than usual, in 1803, the fifth year of this discovery, the\r\nenormous carcass became entirely disengaged, and fell down from the\r\nice-crag on a sand-bank, forming part of the coast of the Arctic Ocean.\r\nIn the month of March of that year, the Tungusian carried away the two\r\ntusks, which he sold for fifty rubles, about fifteen pounds sterling.\r\n\r\n\"Two years afterwards this animal still remained on the sand-bank where\r\nit had fallen from the ice; but its body was then greatly mutilated.\r\nThe peasants had taken away considerable quantities of its flesh\r\nto feed their dogs; and the wild animals, particularly the white\r\nbears, had also feasted on the carcass; yet the skeleton remained\r\nquite entire, except that one of the fore-legs was gone. The entire\r\nspine, the pelvis, one shoulder-blade, and three legs, were still\r\nheld together by their ligaments, and by some remains of the skin;\r\nand the other shoulder-blade was found at a short distance. The head\r\nremained, covered by the dried skin, and the pupil of the eyes was\r\nstill distinguishable. The brain also remained within the skull, but\r\na good deal shrunk and dried up; and one of the ears was in excellent\r\npreservation, still retaining a tuft of strong bristly hair. The upper\r\nlip was a good deal eaten away, and the under lip was entirely gone, so\r\nthat the teeth were distinctly seen. The animal had a long mane on its\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n\"The skin was extremely thick and heavy, and so much of it remained\r\nas required the exertions of ten men to carry away, which they did\r\nwith considerable difficulty. More than thirty pounds' weight of the\r\nhair and bristles of this animal were gathered from the wet sand-bank,\r\nhaving been trampled into the mud by the white bears, while devouring\r\nthe carcass. The hair was of three distinct kinds; one consisting of\r\nstiff black bristles, a foot or more in length; another of thinner\r\nbristles, or coarse flexible hair, of a reddish-brown colour; and the\r\nthird of a coarse reddish-brown wool, which grew among the roots of the\r\nhair. These afford an undeniable proof that this animal had belonged\r\nto a race of elephants inhabiting a cold region, with which we are now\r\nunacquainted, and by no means fitted to live in the torrid zone. It is\r\nalso evident that this enormous animal must have been frozen up by the\r\nice at the moment of its death.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GIGANTIC ELK.\r\n\r\nThere are frequently found in the peat bogs of England and Ireland, the\r\nbones and horns of a large Elk, called the gigantic Elk, and sometimes\r\nthe Irish Elk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.\r\n\r\nMEGATHERIUM   GIGANTIC ELK]\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of him; and you may judge how well he was entitled to\r\nhis name, when I tell you that some pairs of his horns have been found,\r\nwhich measured nearly twelve feet across from tip to tip. He must\r\nhave been considerably larger than the Wapiti Deer in the Zoological\r\nGardens, and of quite a different form.\r\n\r\nIt is not known when these creatures became extinct; but it is probable\r\nthat it may have been since Britain has been inhabited by man.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEGATHERIUM.\r\n\r\nThe bones of this great beast were first found at Buenos Ayres in South\r\nAmerica, and a skeleton nearly complete was sent home from thence by\r\nthe Governor to the Royal Cabinet of Madrid, in 1789. They were found\r\nin loose soil, and must apparently have belonged to nearly the same age\r\nas the Fossil Elephant and Irish Elk.\r\n\r\nThe head must have been very much like that of the sloth, but it seems\r\nto have possessed the addition of a small trunk like the Palæotherium I\r\ntold you of just now. The structure of its legs (and in particular its\r\nvery strong short thigh-bone, which is much stouter than that of any\r\nanimal living,) shows that it must have moved very slowly.\r\n\r\nIts teeth show that it lived on vegetables, and the great ungainly\r\nfore-feet, armed with tremendous claws, would lead one to suppose that\r\nit used to dig in the ground for roots, and tear down the branches of\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been covered with a thick shell or coating, thicker\r\nthan the hide of a rhinoceros, and rather resembling the covering of\r\nthe armadillo. I have seen a piece of this wonderful coat of armour in\r\nthe Museum at Paris, which was found along with the skeleton in South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIf one might decide from its likeness to other animals in its various\r\nparts, it was a sulky beast, and, if it could have spoken, would only\r\nhave said to its neighbours, \"Let me alone--I want nothing of you, if\r\nyou want nothing of me.\"\r\n\r\nIts length was full 13 feet, and its height about 9 feet; so you may\r\nsuppose armed, and defended as it was, there was not much chance of\r\nother animals being disposed to meddle with it, for it must have been\r\nbig enough and strong enough to take good care of itself, though it\r\ncould not run very fast.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEAVER.\r\n\r\nYou will, perhaps, be surprised to hear that Beavers once lived in\r\nEngland; but it is known from history, that they were found in Wales\r\nas late as the twelfth century. I have got the bones of some, that\r\nwere given me by a countryman, who picked them out of a peat bog in\r\nHampshire, without knowing what they were. They were buried close by\r\nsome hazel nuts, and some moss that had not lost its colour, and was\r\nin no degree decayed; such is the great power possessed by certain\r\nminerals that exist in these peat bogs, to preserve things from decay,\r\neven during a period which could hardly be less than a thousand years.\r\n\r\nIt is related, that the foot of a lady, which seemed quite fresh,\r\nwas found in peat, where it had lain in contact with some of these\r\nsubstances, with a sandal of a kind that must have been worn many\r\nhundreds of years ago. And though I will not assert that it is true,\r\nyet I will say, that it is very likely to be so, from what I have seen\r\nmyself, in regard to nuts, and moss, and various weeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DODO.\r\n\r\nWhen the Dutch in the 16th century, took possession of the Isle of\r\nFrance, now called Mauritius, which up to that time had not been\r\ninhabited by man, they found a large bird something of the Duck kind,\r\nof which they sent home specimens and representations. They called it\r\nthe Dodo, but why, I cannot tell you.\r\n\r\nThe race has now become extinct, so that many naturalists have declared\r\nthat it never existed, and that the account of it was naughtily\r\ninvented, and sent home for the gratification and delusion of\r\n\r\n   \"Those who greedily pursue\r\n    Things wonderful instead of true.\"\r\n\r\nBut there is not the least doubt of its being a fact, for in the Museum\r\nin London there is a painting said to have been taken from the living\r\nbird; there is also a leg and a plaster cast of the head placed near\r\nthe painting, which naturalists have determined could not have belonged\r\nto any other animal known, from their peculiar construction; there is\r\nalso another foot and the head from which the cast was taken, preserved\r\nin the Museum of the University of Oxford, being the remains of an\r\nentire specimen which was kept in the collection of curiosities made\r\nby Elias Ashmole, Esq. till it rotted. This is representation of these\r\ntwo valuable relics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe account of the removal of the bones was entered in the records of\r\nthe University, and the date is the 1st January, 1755.\r\n\r\nMore recently some of the bones have been found in the Mauritius, and\r\nhave been sent to Paris, where I have heard they may be seen now.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been the most unwieldy and inactive bird in existence,\r\nand to have held nearly the same kind of place among feathered animals\r\nas the sloth does among beasts. The body was very massive, and almost\r\nround, and seemed to be stuck upon two short thick legs like pillars.\r\nThe tail was strangely out of its place, according to the usual form\r\nof birds; and two little caricatures of wings were hung upon its great\r\nblank sides. A thick pursy neck supported the head, which consisted\r\nof two enormous chaps that opened far behind the eyes. You will best\r\nunderstand the form of the bill by looking at the cut copied from the\r\npainting which I mentioned before, and you may there see how like a\r\nmonk's cowl the feathers of his head looked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSome of the Dutch who met with this bird in its own country called\r\nit the nauseous bird, and declared that its flesh was intolerably\r\ndisagreeable to the taste; while others asserted that it was very good\r\neating, and that about three Dodos would feast a hundred men. But\r\nwhatever may have been the quality of the flesh, I do not believe what\r\nthe latter said of its quantity, for the head and leg which I have\r\nseen, and which appear to have belonged to a full grown bird, are not\r\nvery much larger than those of a swan.\r\n\r\nHowever this is now a question which of course will never be certainly\r\ndecided, as there are no more of them to be eaten. It appears that,\r\nlike the beavers and wolves in England, the progress of man and\r\ncultivation deprived them of their sources of sustenance.\r\n\r\nIf we may judge of what his character was, from his appearance, he\r\nmust have been a silly, voracious creature, with hardly any power of\r\nresistance or flight. However, like all the rest of God's works, he was\r\nno doubt adapted for the circumstances in which he was placed, and had\r\nenough means of enjoyment, to make it well worth his while to live as\r\nlong as he could.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPARLEY DESCRIBES VOLCANOES, EARTHQUAKES, AND HOT SPRINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have no doubt often heard of Volcanoes and Earthquakes, for almost\r\neverybody in all ages has felt a deep interest in them, and a curiosity\r\nto know what they are caused by. If you will listen to me, while I\r\nmerely describe them as they really exist, without \"drawing the long\r\nbow,\" as people say, I will then tell you how I think they are produced.\r\n\r\nIt is quite certain that there is an important connexion between\r\nVolcanoes and Earthquakes; and we may safely take this for granted, and\r\nat once call the cause of both, whatever it may be, _volcanic agency_.\r\n\r\nIt has been discovered by extensive observations, that this agency\r\ndoes not exert itself in individual spots, so as to produce here a\r\nVolcano and there an Earthquake; but its operations take place over\r\nlong tracts of country in which the Volcanoes are placed, and, in the\r\nspaces between them, Earthquakes are more or less frequent.\r\n\r\nThese tracts are called Volcanic bands; one of them extends nearly\r\nparallel with the West Coast of South America, along the chain of\r\nmountains called the Andes, which you will see marked on the map; and\r\nanother much smaller extends from Mount Vesuvius to Mount Etna, with\r\nthe Volcanic Island Stromboli, and several extinct Volcanoes lying\r\nbetween them, and then turns to the East, through several of the Greek\r\nIslands, and passes on to Syria, where Earthquakes are frequent.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes in their simplest form are nothing more than violent\r\nshakings of the ground; but sometimes the earth is split open;\r\nsometimes it is raised; and sometimes it is depressed.\r\n\r\nI shall tell you of some of the changes which took place in the great\r\nEarthquake of Calabria, which lies in the smaller volcanic band I\r\nmentioned to you between Vesuvius and Etna.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKE OF CALABRIA.\r\n\r\nThe shocks began in 1783, and lasted for nearly four years, till the\r\nend of 1786. During this time the King of Naples sent persons to take\r\ncorrect notes and representations of all that was going on, and we\r\nhave therefore got a better account of it than we have of any other\r\nEarthquake that ever occurred.\r\n\r\nThe convulsion of the earth, sea, and air, extended as far as Naples,\r\nand over the whole of Sicily; but the district over which it was so\r\nviolent as to excite intense alarm, was about five hundred miles in\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\n\"The first shock of February 5th, 1783, threw down, in two minutes,\r\nthe greater part of the houses in all the cities, towns, and villages,\r\nfrom the western sides of the Apennines in Calabria Ultra, to Messina\r\nin Sicily, and convulsed the whole surface of the country. Another\r\noccurred on the 28th of March, with almost equal violence. The chain of\r\ngranite mountains which passes through Calabria from north to south,\r\nand attains the height of many thousand feet, was shaken but slightly;\r\nbut it is said that a great part of the shocks which were spread with\r\na wave-like motion through the recent strata from west to east, became\r\nvery violent when they reached the point of junction with the granite,\r\nas if a reaction was produced where the wave-like movement of the soft\r\nstrata was suddenly arrested by the more solid rocks. The surface of\r\nthe country often heaved like the billows of a swelling sea, which\r\nproduced a swimming in the head like sea-sickness. It is particularly\r\nstated, in almost all the accounts, that just before each shock the\r\nclouds appeared motionless; and although no explanation is offered of\r\nthis phenomenon, it is obviously the same as that observed in a ship\r\nat sea when it pitches violently. The clouds seem arrested in their\r\ncareer as often as the vessel rises in a direction contrary to their\r\ncourse; so that the Calabrians must have experienced precisely the same\r\nmotion on the land.\"\r\n\r\nAt Messina in Sicily, the shore was rent; and the soil along the port,\r\nwhich before the shock was perfectly level, was inclined towards the\r\nsea, and the sea itself was considerably deeper, which showed that the\r\ninclination must have been occasioned by the bottom's sinking. The quay\r\nalso sunk down 14 inches below the level of the sea, and the houses in\r\nthe neighbourhood were much cracked.\r\n\r\nIn one town there was a large round tower of great strength, which was\r\ndivided by a perpendicular rent, and one-half was raised up several\r\nfeet, so as to show the foundations. Those who saw it, said that it\r\nlooked like a great tooth half extracted, showing the fangs. Along the\r\nline of the crack, the walls were found to fit so exactly together,\r\nthat you would not have known they had even been divided if the courses\r\nof the stones had not been disturbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere was a very curious difference between some of the walls which\r\nhad been thrown down, or very much shaken by some of the shocks. In\r\nsome of them, the separate stones were parted from the mortar, so as to\r\nleave an exact mould where they had rested; and in others, the mortar\r\nwas ground to dust between the stones. It was not less strange to see\r\nthe effect of what must have been whirling movements in the ground.\r\nIn some streets, one house would be thrown down, and leave the rest\r\nuninjured; while in others, all the houses but one were thrown down,\r\nand that one remained firm and unmoved. Two obelisks were twisted\r\nround, so that the stones of which they were composed, stood at cross\r\npurposes. This cut represents one of the two, as it stood after the\r\nearthquake, and before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"It appears evident that a great part of the rending and splitting of\r\nthe ground was the effect of a violent motion from below upwards; and\r\nin a multitude of cases where the rents and chasms opened and closed\r\nalternately, we must suppose that the earth was by turns heaved up,\r\nand then let fall again. We may conceive the same effect to be produced\r\non a small scale, if, by some mechanical force, a pavement composed\r\nof large flags of stone should be raised up and then allowed to fall\r\nsuddenly, so as to resume its original position. If any small pebbles\r\nhappened to be lying on the line of contact of two flags, they would\r\nfall into the opening when the pavement rose, and be swallowed up, so\r\nthat no trace of them would appear after the subsidence of the stones.\r\nIn the same manner, when the earth was upheaved, large houses, trees,\r\ncattle, and men were engulfed in an instant in chasms and fissures; and\r\nwhen the ground sunk down again, the earth closed upon them, so that\r\nno vestige of them was discoverable on the surface. In many instances\r\nindividuals were swallowed up by one shock, and then thrown out alive,\r\ntogether with large jets of water, by the shock which immediately\r\nsucceeded.\"\r\n\r\nThe district called Jerocarne, was torn in a surprising manner, and in\r\none spot the cracks resembled those in a starred pane of glass; and as\r\nthese cracks remained open when the earthquake was over, it seemed as\r\nif the middle had been permanently lifted up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"In the vicinity of Oppido, the central point from which the earthquake\r\ndiffused its violent movements, many houses were swallowed up by the\r\nyawning earth, which closed immediately over them. In the adjacent\r\ndistrict also of Cannamaria, four farm-houses, several oil-stores,\r\nand some spacious dwelling-houses were so completely engulphed in one\r\nchasm, that no vestige of them was afterwards discernible.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the many fissures that were opened, there was one, a mile long,\r\na hundred feet wide, and thirty feet deep; and another, three quarters\r\nof a mile long, one hundred and fifty feet wide, and one hundred feet\r\ndeep; and a third, about a quarter of a mile long, which was two\r\nhundred and twenty-five feet deep.\r\n\r\nA mountain was cleft completely in two; and a lake of considerable size\r\nwas formed by the opening of this great chasm, and springs bursting\r\nout at the bottom. The inhabitants of the neighbourhood were afraid\r\nthat the pool of nearly stagnant water which was thus formed would\r\ninjure their health, and were at great expense in trying to drain it;\r\nbut it was all in vain, for the springs that fed it at the bottom were\r\ninexhaustible.\r\n\r\nA great mass of earth, or hill, two hundred feet high, and four hundred\r\nfeet in diameter, was moved nearly four miles out of its place, with\r\ntrees growing upon it; and another similar mass, with a house on it,\r\nwhich was not at all injured. Some olive and mulberry trees travelled\r\na full mile. These great movements were aided by springs under the\r\nmasses of earth, which made a slimy sort of road for them; and, of\r\ncourse, the whole distance was down hill.\r\n\r\n\"Great agitation was frequently observed in the bed of the sea during\r\nthe shocks, and, on those parts of the coast where the movement was\r\nmost violent, all kinds of fish were taken in greater abundance, and\r\nwith much greater facility. Some rare species, which usually lie buried\r\nin the sand, were taken on the surface of the waters in great quantity.\r\nThe sea is said to have boiled up near Messina, and to have been\r\nagitated as if by a copious discharge of vapours from its bottom. The\r\nPrince of Scilla had persuaded a great part of his vassals to betake\r\nthemselves to their fishing-boats for safety, and he himself had gone\r\non board. On the night of the 5th of February, when some of the people\r\nwere sleeping in the boats, and others on a level plain, slightly\r\nelevated above the sea, the earth rocked, and suddenly a great mass\r\nwas torn from the contiguous Mount Jaci, and thrown down with a\r\ndreadful crash upon the plain. Immediately afterwards, the sea rising\r\nthirty palms above the level of this low tract, rolled foaming over it,\r\nand swept away the multitude. It then retreated, but soon rushed back\r\nagain with greater violence, bringing with it some of the people and\r\nanimals it had carried away. At the same time every boat was sunk or\r\ndashed against the beach, and some of them were swept far inland. The\r\naged Prince, with one thousand four hundred and thirty of his people,\r\nwas destroyed. The number of persons who perished during the earthquake\r\nis estimated at about forty thousand, and about twenty thousand more\r\ndied by diseases which were caused by insufficient nourishment,\r\nexposure to the atmosphere, and malaria, arising from the new stagnant\r\nlakes and pools. By far the greater number were buried under the ruins\r\nof their houses; while some were burnt to death in the conflagrations\r\nwhich almost invariably followed the shocks, and consumed immense\r\nmagazines of oil and other provisions. A small number were engulfed\r\nin chasms and fissures, and their skeletons are perhaps buried in the\r\nearth to this day, at the depth of several hundred feet, for such was\r\nthe profundity of some of the openings which did not close in again.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a fine description of the Earthquake and this melancholy\r\nresult, in Cowper's Task, which we shall quote.\r\n\r\n      Alas for Sicily! rude fragments now\r\n    Lie scatter'd where the shapely column stood.\r\n    Her palaces are dust. In all her streets\r\n    The voice of singing and the sprightly chord\r\n    Are silent. Revelry, and dance, and show\r\n    Suffer a syncope and solemn pause;\r\n    While God performs upon the trembling stage\r\n    Of his own works his dreadful part alone.\r\n    The rocks fall headlong, and the valleys rise,\r\n    The rivers die into offensive pools,\r\n    And charged with putrid verdure, breathe a gross\r\n    And mortal nuisance into all the air.\r\n    What solid was, by transformation strange,\r\n    Grows fluid; and the fix'd and rooted earth,\r\n    Tormented into billows, heaves and swells,\r\n    Or with vortiginous and hideous whirl\r\n    Sucks down its prey insatiable. Immense\r\n    The tumult and the overthrow, the pangs\r\n    And agonies of human and of brute\r\n    Multitudes, fugitive on every side,\r\n    And fugitive in vain. The sylvan scene\r\n    Migrates uplifted; and, with all its soil\r\n    Alighting in far distant fields, finds out\r\n    A new possessor, and survives the change.\r\n    Ocean has caught the frenzy, and upwrought\r\n    To an enormous and o'erbearing height,\r\n    Not by a mighty wind, but by that voice\r\n    Which winds and waves obey, invades the shore\r\n    With force resistless. Where now the throng,\r\n    That press'd the beach, and, hasty to depart,\r\n    Look'd to the sea for safety? They are gone,\r\n    Gone with the refluent wave into the deep--\r\n    A prince with half his people!\r\n\r\nYou will find a great many other astonishing effects of this Earthquake\r\ndescribed in Mr. Lyell's Work on Geology, from which I have extracted\r\nsome parts of the preceding account.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLCANOES.\r\n\r\nThe word Volcano comes from Vulcan, the name of the God of fire in the\r\nGreek mythology. You have read how the poets used to represent him as\r\nengaged underground in forging thunderbolts for Jupiter, and other\r\nwork of the same kind, with the assistance of his one-eyed journeymen\r\nthe Cyclopes. They feigned that Volcanoes were the chimneys of his\r\nworkshops, and that when an eruption took place he was busy forging his\r\niron.\r\n\r\nOthers pretended that when Jupiter had overcome the giants named\r\nTitans, who had rebelled against him, instead of putting them in the\r\nstocks, he placed mountains upon them, and that when the imprisoned\r\nmonsters turned themselves from one side to the other, earthquakes and\r\neruptions were the consequence.\r\n\r\nHowever, we don't believe any of these stories now, neither perhaps did\r\nthe ancients. But you must learn all about them and their meaning,\r\n(where they have any,) from your schoolmaster. My business now is to\r\ntell you what Volcanoes are.\r\n\r\nThey are openings in the surface of the earth, from whence ignited\r\nmatter of various kinds, smoke, and ashes, are sent forth by some\r\nsubterranean agency.\r\n\r\nFor the most part they do not always keep in activity, but have long\r\nintervals of rest for months, and sometimes for very many years,\r\nbetween the eruptions.\r\n\r\nOne of the few that always keeps in eruption, is Stromboli, one of the\r\nLipari Islands off the coast of Sicily, which there is good reason to\r\nthink, has been active for nearly 1600 years. This Volcano is merely\r\na mountain or rock, standing out of the sea, and the melted matter,\r\nthat occasionally runs down its sides, flows directly into the water,\r\nand at once kills and parboils the fish that happen to be near it, and\r\nthey are thus sometimes taken and eaten by the poor fishermen who live\r\nabout the base of the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe way in which an eruption takes place in a Volcano of the other\r\nkind, when it has been quiet for a long time, is as follows.\r\n\r\nGreat noises are heard about the foot of the mountain, and earthquakes\r\nfrequently occur for several days before any change is seen in the\r\nopening or _crater_, as it is called. The springs in the neighbourhood\r\noften disappear, and as you may suppose all these forebodings make the\r\npeople who live near gloomy enough.\r\n\r\nAfter a time a dreadful burst takes place, and the crater is in an\r\ninstant cleared of the stones and earth that may have fallen into it\r\nduring the period of repose; ashes and cinders, rocks and stones, are\r\nthrown up to an immense height in the air, and a great cloud of smoke\r\nand steam accompanies them.\r\n\r\nIn perfectly still weather, this vapour is seen to shape itself in\r\na very beautiful manner. The immense impulse from beneath sends it\r\nup to a vast height as straight and almost as distinct as a pillar.\r\nAt a certain elevation, it spreads abroad and assumes the appearance\r\nrepresented in the plate. When this occurs on Vesuvius, the Italians\r\ncall it the _pine tree cloud_, from the resemblance its form bears to\r\nthat of a pine tree.\r\n\r\nAs the eruption goes on the cloud of smoke which is always copiously\r\ncharged with electricity, sends out brilliant lightnings; its form\r\nbecomes disturbed, and the dark volumes of vapour are angrily sent\r\nforth in shapeless masses. Red-hot stones are sent into the air to a\r\nstupendous height; the melted matter boils up inside the crater and\r\nrolls down the sides of the mountain, setting fire to the trees that it\r\nmeets with, and destroying or enveloping whatever else remains in its\r\nway.\r\n\r\nYou will see their effect as they appear by night, in the other plate.\r\nI should tell you that the Volcano represented in both the pictures is\r\nMount Vesuvius.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.\r\n\r\nVESUVIUS N^o. 1]\r\n\r\nThe melted matter that boils up in the crater, and flows down the\r\nmountain, is called Lava. I dare say most of you have seen some pieces\r\nof this substance when polished and worked into ornaments. It is found\r\nin great variety, and is sometimes black, porous, and light like\r\ncinders; sometimes it consists of crystallized particles of quartz,\r\nfelspar, and other minerals, so as closely to resemble granite; and not\r\nunfrequently it is a solid dark-coloured mass, heavy and hard as the\r\nstone that our streets are paved with.\r\n\r\nIt issues from the crater in a melted state, bubbling and boiling like\r\nwater in a tea-kettle, but you must not therefore suppose that it runs\r\ndown the declivity of the mountain like water. On the contrary, its\r\nmotion is mostly very slow, seldom being faster when it gets at some\r\ndistance from the crater, than four miles an hour, which is about as\r\nfast as a man can walk. When it has run still further from its source\r\nit does not travel more than a few yards in a day.\r\n\r\nThe motion of a stream of Lava is very peculiar, for the surface\r\nexposed to the air is immediately formed into a crust, and hence it\r\nconstantly moves with a crackling noise, and when the stream is quite\r\nfresh no light is seen except in the cracks that are constantly being\r\nformed at the extremity.\r\n\r\nIn this way a current will sometimes go drawling on for months after\r\nthe eruption which gave rise to it has ceased.\r\n\r\nA very curious effect is produced when the lava runs in a certain state\r\nof fluidity down a steep descent. A thick, strong crust forms on the\r\noutside, and it is one of the qualities of lava when it has become\r\nhard, like most other stony substances, to present great opposition\r\nto the passage of heat. In consequence of this the liquid lava in the\r\ninside of the current is kept hot, and continues to run on for a long\r\ntime after the supply from the crater has ceased, and leaves the crust\r\nin the form of an arched passage.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have told you about lava streams, you will see that there\r\nis not much danger from them to living creatures, who may always get\r\nout of their way fast enough: but sometimes houses and even towns are\r\nenveloped in them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.\r\n\r\nVESUVIUS N^o. 2]\r\n\r\nHowever, from the peculiar mode in which they travel there is often a\r\nway of preventing this, and on one occasion it was resorted to, and\r\nthe town of Catania thereby saved. A current of lava from Mount Etna\r\nwas making its way straight towards the town, but a body of fifty bold\r\nstrong fellows went out to meet it, armed with crow bars; with these\r\nthey broke great holes in the crust at the side, and thus the stream\r\nwas turned into another course, and pursued its way on one side of the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nThroughout an eruption, a great quantity of dust is produced by the\r\nrubbing of the stones against each other which are thrown out from the\r\ncrater, and often fall back and are thrown up again several times.\r\n\r\nThis dust is driven over a great extent of country, and a gentleman\r\nwhom I visited, who lived about fourteen miles from Mount Vesuvius,\r\ntold me that during the great eruption of 1822, his garden was covered\r\nwith them, to the depth of full six inches.\r\n\r\nBut in more violent eruptions they are carried much further than this.\r\nIn an eruption of a Volcano in Sumbawa, an island which lies some miles\r\nto the East of Java, the ashes were carried to a distance of 270 miles\r\nin such quantities as to darken the air, and in another direction\r\nthey were found 300 miles off. They fell so heavily 40 miles away\r\nfrom the Volcano that they broke into many houses, and rendered them\r\nuninhabitable.\r\n\r\nQuantities of liquid lava are thrown upwards, and shape themselves into\r\nnearly the forms of fish by their passage through the air. These are\r\ncalled bombs by the inhabitants, and the fall of them is very justly\r\ndreaded, as they come with great violence.\r\n\r\nThe size of the largest of those from which the following picture was\r\ntaken, was six inches long, two inches and a quarter wide, and one\r\ninch and three quarters thick; but there are much larger sometimes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf you should have a chance of examining any of these, you may observe\r\nhow wisely the living principle, which gives the figure to fish, has\r\nbeen ordained by their Creator to provide the best form to assist their\r\nmotions, in a medium in which they are suspended, and do not move on\r\nground as the beasts do; seeing that it is precisely the same sort\r\nof figure as the laws of inanimate matter impress upon it, when in a\r\nyielding state, and being impelled to move under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nI must give you a notion of the quantity of lava sometimes sent out in\r\na single eruption.\r\n\r\nThe Volcano called Skapta Jokul, in Iceland, in the year 1794, sent\r\nout two great streams, one of which was 50 miles in length, from 10 to\r\n15 in breadth, and the ordinary depth about 100 feet, but in some deep\r\nvalleys it was more than 500 feet. The other was forty miles long,\r\nseven wide on the average, and about the same depth as the first.\r\n\r\nThese streams were not cold in the year 1805, eleven years after they\r\nhad issued from the earth, so that you may judge how long the hardened\r\nlava keeps in the heat.\r\n\r\nDuring the eruption in which this immense mass of melted matter was\r\nthrown out, twenty villages were destroyed, more than nine thousand\r\npersons killed, and an immense number of cattle.\r\n\r\nThe vapour which rises at first in immense clouds, when the eruption\r\nslackens, or when it gets out of the reach of the heat, condenses, and\r\nmingled with the dust thrown up with it, forms mud, which rushes in\r\ntorrents down the mountain. These streams of mud are called alluvions,\r\nand are very much more dreaded by the inhabitants than the lava\r\nstreams, because they are so much quicker in their movement.\r\n\r\nIt was one of these, and not a stream of lava which enveloped the\r\nRoman City Pompeii; and which entered the modern town of Torre del\r\nGreco, and so raised the ground that the lower rooms of the houses were\r\nconverted into cellars, and the people were obliged to make the street\r\ndoors on what had before been the second story.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT VOLCANO KIRAUEA, IN THE ISLAND OF HAWAII.\r\n\r\nThere is a very remarkable Volcano in the Island of Hawaii, where\r\nCaptain Cook was killed.\r\n\r\nThe crater, instead of being at the top of a mountain like those of\r\nmost other Volcanoes, is a large plain, seven miles in circumference,\r\nsunk below the surface of the surrounding country, and walled in by\r\nrugged cliffs more than seven hundred feet high.\r\n\r\nOn this plain there are fifty-one conical hillocks, which are almost\r\nconstantly sending out vapour and lava, and red hot stones. The\r\nsurrounding banks consist entirely of sulphur and lava.\r\n\r\nThe islanders, before they were taught the truths of Christianity,\r\nbelieved it to be the abode of their deities, the chief of whom they\r\ncall Pelé, and to her, they say, that everything which grows near the\r\nVolcano is sacred. When some missionaries were going to visit it, and\r\nplucked some juicy berries from the shrubs that grew there to quench\r\ntheir thirst, the native guides begged them to desist till they had\r\nmade an offering to Pelé. When they got to the edge of the crater, they\r\nthrew some of the berries in, and said, \"Pelé, here are your berries,\r\nand I am now going to eat some.\" They then ate fast enough, and were\r\nwilling that the missionaries should do the same.\r\n\r\nThe following are extracts from the account of our countryman, Mr.\r\nStewart's visit to this terrific place.\r\n\r\n\"I can compare the general aspect of the bottom of the crater, to\r\nnothing that will give a livelier image of it to your mind, than to\r\nthe appearance the Otsego Lake would present, if the ice with which\r\nit is covered in winter, were suddenly broken up by a heavy storm,\r\nand as suddenly frozen again, while large slabs and blocks were still\r\ntoppling, and dashing, and heaping against each other, with the motion\r\nof the waves. Just so rough and distorted was the black mass under\r\nour feet, only a hundred-fold more terrific, independently of the\r\ninnumerable cracks, fissures, deep chasms and holes, from which the\r\nsulphureous vapour, steam, and smoke were exhaled, with a degree of\r\nheat that testified the near vicinity of fire.\r\n\r\n\"At an inconsiderable distance from us, was one of the largest of the\r\nconical craters, whose laborious action had so greatly impressed our\r\nminds during the night, and we hastened to a nearer examination of it.\r\nOn reaching its base, we judged it to be one hundred and fifty feet\r\nhigh, a huge, irregularly shapen, inverted funnel of lava, covered\r\nwith clefts, orifices, and tunnels, from which bodies of steam escaped,\r\nwhile pale flames, ashes, stones, and lava, were propelled with equal\r\nforce and noise, from its ragged mouth.\r\n\r\n\"The chattering of the islanders around our cabins, and the occasional\r\nsound of voices in protracted conversation among our own number,\r\nhad scarcely ceased long enough to admit of sound sleep, when the\r\nvolcano again began roaring and labouring with redoubled activity.\r\nThe confusion of noises was prodigiously great. These sounds were not\r\nfixed or confined to one place, but rolled from one end of the crater\r\nto the other; sometimes seeming to be immediately under us, when a\r\nsensible tremor of the ground on which we lay took place; and then\r\nagain rushing to the farthest end with incalculable velocity. The whole\r\nair was filled with the tumult; and those most soundly asleep were\r\nquickly roused by it to thorough wakefulness. One of our party sprang\r\nup in his cot, exclaiming, 'We shall certainly have an eruption; such\r\npower must burst through everything;' He had barely ceased speaking,\r\nwhen a dense column of heavy black smoke was seen arising from the\r\ncrater directly in front of us; the subterranean struggle ceased,\r\nand immediately after, flames burst from a large cone, near which we\r\nhad been in the morning, and which then appeared to have been long\r\ninactive. Red-hot stones, cinders, and ashes, were also propelled to a\r\ngreat height with immense violence; and shortly after, the molten lava\r\ncame boiling up, and flowed down the sides of the cone, and over the\r\nsurrounding scoria, in two beautiful curved streams, glittering with\r\nindiscribable brilliance.\r\n\r\n\"At the same time a whole lake of fire opened in a more distant part.\r\nThis could not have been less than two miles in circumference; and its\r\naction was more horribly sublime than anything I ever imagined to\r\nexist, even in the ideal vision of unearthly things. Its surface had\r\nall the agitation of an ocean; billow after billow tossed its monstrous\r\nbosom in the air, and occasionally those from different directions\r\nburst with such violence, as in the concussion to dash the fiery spray\r\nforty and fifty feet high. It was at once the most splendidly beautiful\r\nand dreadfully fearful of spectacles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE FORMATION OF NEW ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nYou must know that most of the volcanic mountains bear evident traces\r\nof having been built up of matter thrown out, in the first place,\r\nfrom a crack or hole in the ground, and afterwards from the _crater_\r\nor _cup_, which would thus soon be formed. At every eruption a new\r\nlayer of dust, and cinders, and lava, is added, and thus a mountain is\r\ngradually produced.\r\n\r\nIn some instances, the successive layers may be seen is the crater,\r\nas is the case with Vesuvius, of the summit of which this would nearly\r\nrepresent the section, if we could cut it in two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nVolcanic operations can go on very nearly as well at the bottom of the\r\nsea, as upon dry land; and if you remember what I told you before,\r\nrespecting the mode in which the currents of lava flow, you will not be\r\nmuch surprised to hear that their progress is not stopped by the water,\r\nthough it may be somewhat impeded. It is certain that the streams often\r\ntravel a great way at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nWhen a Volcano breaks out under the sea, if the eruption send out a\r\nsufficient quantity of lava, and stones and dust, it gets above the\r\nsurface and makes such a Volcano as Stromboli.\r\n\r\nIf the Volcano should afterwards become quiet, then an island is the\r\nresult, and if large enough, it may be inhabited.\r\n\r\nA great many of the islands of the South Sea, and some of the Greek\r\nislands, originated in this manner; and, only two or three years ago,\r\nan island suddenly rose up off the coast of Sicily, and was taken\r\npossession of in due form by a British captain, in the name of the king\r\nof England; but, as the land consisted of loose earth, and had not much\r\nlava to bind it together, it soon sunk down, and now no trace of it is\r\nto be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE GEYSERS OF ICELAND.\r\n\r\nThere are many Volcanoes in Iceland, and the whole island seems to have\r\nbeen the produce of Volcanic agency. I am going to describe to you one\r\nof the most singular proofs of this.\r\n\r\nGeysers are springs which spout out at intervals great streams of\r\nhot water. The name is taken from the Icelandic word, _geysa_, which\r\nsignifies, _to rage_, or, _burst forth violently_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.\r\n\r\nGEYSERS OF ICELAND]\r\n\r\nThe Icelanders are a very simple, excellent people, and exceedingly\r\nkind and hospitable to strangers. This is not the place for me to tell\r\nyou how much kindness I experienced among them; but if I were to do\r\nso, you would have as high a regard for them as I have. They have in\r\ngeneral a considerable degree of intelligence, but I was surprised to\r\nfind that a great many of them did not know where the Geysers were, or\r\nanything about them.\r\n\r\nThere are many springs of the same kind in several parts of Iceland;\r\nbut those that are generally known as _the Geysers_, are near the town\r\nof Haukadal, in the south-west part of Iceland. To these I went in\r\ncompany with four other persons, and a guide.\r\n\r\nAfter a dreary ride through a wild volcanic looking country, we left\r\nour horses in a safe place, and then, proceeding some distance on foot,\r\nwe saw clouds of steam arising over the hills before us. A little\r\nfurther on we got into the plain, where the Geysers are situated, which\r\nis full of boiling springs and holes sending out steam like the valve\r\nof a steam-boiler.\r\n\r\nThe great Geyser is at the top of a hillock, which seems to have been\r\nformed in the course of years by the substances which the hot water\r\nholds in solution, and deposits as it cools.\r\n\r\nAt the top of this mound we found a pond of the shape of a saucer,\r\nlined with the most curious incrustations of spar, which exactly\r\nresembled the heads of cauliflowers. It was then about half full of the\r\nmost beautiful hot water, as clear as crystal, which was just stirred\r\nin gentle waves by the steam that rose up from the opening at the\r\nbottom of the basin.\r\n\r\nWe took advantage of this tranquil state of the spring, to examine this\r\nopening. We let down a line, with a weight at the end, to the depth\r\nof about eighty feet, and as nearly as we could judge, it went down\r\nperpendicularly.\r\n\r\nThe hole was nearly round, and about nine feet in diameter, but it got\r\ngradually wider towards the top like a funnel. The inside showed the\r\nsame kind of flinty incrustation as the hillock was composed of, worn\r\nas smooth as glass by the forcible passage of the water. The water was\r\nthen at a temperature of two hundred degrees.\r\n\r\nThe saucer-shaped reservoir was fifty feet across, and four feet deep.\r\n\r\nI ought to tell you that the waters of the Geysers have a petrifying\r\nproperty, and hence the ground all around them is covered with what was\r\nonce grass, moss, and sticks, converted into stone, of which we brought\r\naway many beautiful specimens.\r\n\r\nIt was very late in the evening when we had completed this examination,\r\nand fixed our tent where we intended to pass the night. The springs\r\nstill continued quiet, and you may judge how impatient we were for\r\nsomething to be going on. However, as it was dark, and we were very\r\ntired, having had a great deal of fatigue during the day, we lay down\r\nin the tent and went to sleep.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight we were suddenly called up by one of our party, to\r\nwitness the great Geyser in its full glory. It threw up several jets,\r\nshould think of at least ninety feet high, and sent off vast clouds of\r\nsteam. There was only just light enough for us to distinguish the water\r\nand steam; but the effect was very grand, and such as we shall never\r\nforget, though it did not leave much behind in our minds to talk about,\r\nas everything seemed indistinct and confused.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as soon as it was light, there was a beautiful\r\neruption of the _New Geyser_, as it is called. The column of water was\r\neight feet in diameter, and full sixty feet high, and the clouds of\r\nsteam were prodigious. The sun was just then rising, and the effect\r\nof his rays through the water and stream, was exquisitely beautiful,\r\nproducing many little rainbows. When the water had sunk down, its place\r\nwas taken by a tremendous jet of spray and steam, rushing out with a\r\ndeafening roar to nearly the same height as the water.\r\n\r\nWhen we threw some large stones into the pipe, the steam instantly\r\ncarried them up to an amazing height; and in several instances, when\r\nthey went up quite perpendicularly, kept them within its influence for\r\nsome minutes, throwing them upwards several times successively, in a\r\nvery strange manner; the Geyser seemed to play with them as a boy plays\r\nwith his ball when he throws it up and catches it again and again.\r\n\r\nWe were not yet satisfied, because we had not seen an eruption fairly\r\nfrom beginning to end; so we waited some time longer. At about seven\r\no'clock in the morning, we heard low grumbling sounds near the great\r\nGeyser, and the water in the basin bubbled up a little more actively.\r\n\r\nWe then had an hour and a half of anxious expectation, during which\r\nwe kept walking round the hillock; there were then about a dozen loud\r\nreports which made the earth tremble, and the water rose to near the\r\ntop of the basin, and became so restless that many of the waves washed\r\nover the edge.\r\n\r\nA little while afterwards, the reports became as loud as the firing of\r\nartillery; the ground shook violently under our feet; we ran down the\r\nmound, and had hardly got upon the level ground before the water rushed\r\nup the pipe with such thick clouds of steam, as completely to conceal\r\nthe stream. These bursts took place in this manner to the height of\r\nabout twenty feet.\r\n\r\nThere was then a rest for a few seconds, which was followed by several\r\njets from forty to sixty feet high; and after them a column was thrown\r\nup eighty feet high, and ten feet in diameter. But the last jet was the\r\nmost remarkable, for it was more than ninety feet high, and lasted for\r\nseven minutes.\r\n\r\nThis great effort seemed to have wearied the Geyser, for the water\r\ninstantly sunk down out of the basin into the pipe, quite out of sight;\r\nbut in a few minutes it rose again to within a foot of the edge of the\r\nbasin, and then remained stationary.\r\n\r\nBesides the great perpendicular jets, there were many little ones\r\ncurling and twisting about in all directions; and we were taught to be\r\ncareful of these by one of my companions getting badly scalded in the\r\nleg, for they were very sudden and uncertain in their movements.\r\n\r\nWhen we were quite sure it was all over, we tried the temperature of\r\nthe water in the basin, and found it to be twenty degrees cooler than\r\nbefore the eruption, which was probably caused by the exposure of the\r\nwater which had been thrown up into the air.\r\n\r\nIt seems there are generally about five or six eruptions of each of\r\nthe two great Geysers, within twenty-four hours. But while we were on\r\nthe spot, many of the smaller springs spouted up much oftener, and one\r\nbustling little thing darted out its waters in all directions, three or\r\nfour times in an hour.\r\n\r\nWe did not see any jet from the great Geyser above one hundred feet\r\nhigh; but some travellers have asserted that they are at times two or\r\nthree hundred feet in height. It would appear that the force of the\r\nGeysers varies considerably, and in some instances is affected by the\r\nearthquakes which often happen here; some of which seem to cripple, and\r\nothers to strengthen them.\r\n\r\nSome of the water of the great Geyser falls over the edge of the basin\r\ninto a deep hole in the rock below, which makes a capital warm bath,\r\nfor by the time the water reaches it, it is of the desirable coolness.\r\nI can assure you, we enjoyed a bathe in it very much indeed.\r\n\r\nThere are several other springs in Iceland of nearly the same\r\ncharacter, and the most remarkable are the Hot Springs of Reykium.\r\nThe largest of these has two openings, from one of which the water\r\nis incessantly flowing to the height of six or eight feet; the other\r\nopening is about ten feet distant, and is surrounded by an incrusted\r\nbrim, like that of the great Geyser. The eruptions take place from this\r\nabout fifteen times in twenty-four hours, to the height of about thirty\r\nfeet, accompanied with a great deal of steam.\r\n\r\nThere is also a most wonderful spring in Reykium, called the Badstofa.\r\nIt flows into a great cave, from the bottom of which the water keeps on\r\nretreating and flowing like the waves of the sea, with a deep rumbling\r\nsound for some time before the eruption, when the water rushes up to\r\nthe height of nearly twenty feet.\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile from this place, there are some Hot Springs that rise\r\nin the bed of a river, and force themselves quite through the cold\r\nwater which covers them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SULPHUR MOUNTAINS AND SULPHUR SPRINGS.\r\n\r\nThere is a wonderful place in Iceland, which I am sure you would like\r\nto hear about. It is in the south-west part of the island nearer the\r\nsea than the Geysers. Nearly the whole region consists of sulphur, and\r\nhot clay, and hot dirty water, and it contains some mountains, called\r\nthe _Sulphur Mountains_, from which great quantities of sulphur are\r\ncollected by the peasants, and sent to the continent of Europe for sale.\r\n\r\nThe vapour that is always rising from this wretched-looking country,\r\nmakes a sort of crust over the hot clay; and you will sometimes come to\r\na spot that appears solid, and as you go over it, your horse's hoofs\r\nwill make holes which will send out steam like little cauldrons. A\r\ngentleman who would go over one of these on foot, got terribly scalded\r\nby the crust breaking away under him.\r\n\r\nThere is here a sort of hut, from the bottom of which much steam rises,\r\nand it is used as a vapour bath. People that are affected with various\r\ndiseases, come to it from the surrounding country in considerable\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nAt a little distance from this you come to the brink of a cliff, and\r\nlooking over it, you see twelve large ponds or basins of black mud,\r\nboiling, and splashing, and raging perpetually, with large volumes\r\nof vapour rolling off their surfaces. Beyond these some dismal\r\nblack-looking mountains make a back ground. Can you imagine any thing\r\nmore fearful to look upon?\r\n\r\nBesides these, there is a kind of Geyser of mud, which just resembles\r\nthe real Geysers in its action; but instead of sending up beautiful\r\nclear water, it throws out black unsightly mud, as thick as porridge,\r\nwhich is caught in a nearly round reservoir of more than one hundred\r\nfeet in diameter. It is situated near the summit of a mountain called\r\n_Krabla_ and the reservoir seems to have been in time past a volcanic\r\ncrater.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE GEYSERS MAY BE CAUSED.\r\n\r\nOf course there cannot be hot water without some source of heat, and\r\nthere must, therefore, be a source of heat taken into consideration\r\nin the action of the Geysers. Now, I do not wish to speak of this\r\nhere, I only wish to make you understand how it seems likely that the\r\neruptions of the Geysers are occasioned, supposing there was a supply\r\nof hot water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis cut is intended to represent what may be a section of the\r\nsubterranean reservoir, S W, of the great Geyser, and the pipe, P,\r\nconnected with the saucer-shaped basin, B, at the top of the mound. You\r\nsee the cracks in the rock through which you must suppose hot water\r\nconstantly trickling into the reservoir.\r\n\r\nThe space S will be constantly full of steam, and the space below, W,\r\nwill be always full of water. The water will continue to rise till it\r\ngets to A, and it will then quite stop up the escape of the steam.\r\n\r\nThe steam in S will then press upon the surface of the water, and\r\nforce it up the pipe P with more or less violence, according to the\r\nsupply of heat; but when enough of the steam has escaped to render the\r\npressure less, and the water has sunk to near I, the eruption will\r\ncease.\r\n\r\nIf you will take the trouble to understand this section, you will see\r\nhow reasonable it is that the Geyser should be so constructed; and I\r\nhave seen a little apparatus made of glass, which showed exactly the\r\nsame sort of operations.\r\n\r\nSome little variation in the shape of the reservoir and pipe, may\r\nperhaps be needed to account for all that takes place; but the\r\nprinciple of the activity being produced by the agency of steam, acting\r\nin a space which may be enclosed by the water in its rising to a\r\ncertain height, seems to be certain and satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nOF THE ROCKS CALLED BASALTIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the world, there are rocks which are not stratified\r\nand arranged like those which I described to you some time ago, but are\r\nlaid over the surfaces, and in the crevices of others in this manner:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn this cut, _a_, _a_, _a_, are intended to represent the stratified\r\nrocks, and _b_, _b_, _b_, the others, which from their position are\r\nsometimes called _overlying rocks_, and they mostly consist of a\r\nsubstance called _basalt_, which is nearly black and very hard, and\r\noccasionally with white and coloured minerals imbedded in it. There are\r\ntwo states in which it is found; in one, it occurs in masses without\r\nany particular form, and in the other state it constitutes pillars\r\nshaped with great accuracy and regularity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.\r\n\r\nSTAFFA.]\r\n\r\nThe island of Staffa, one of the western islands of Scotland, and the\r\nGiant's Causeway, on the north coast of Ireland, near Londonderry, are\r\nremarkable instances of the latter state; and as I have seen them both,\r\nI will tell you what sort of places they are.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAFFA.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful island was not generally known to exist, even by the\r\ninhabitants of Scotland, till the last century, when Sir Joseph Bankes\r\nhappened to see it, and published an account of it. Since then it has\r\nbeen visited by numbers, and lately a steam-boat has regularly plied to\r\nit twice a week, from the little town of Oban, in Argyleshire.\r\n\r\nIt was in this way that I went, and a most delightful trip we had\r\nof it. The steam-boat left Oban in the afternoon, full of kind\r\nlight-hearted people, who seemed fully resolved to enjoy themselves. In\r\nthe evening we reached the island of Mull, where we were to spend the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Tobermory, (the little capital of Mull,) anxiously\r\nlook out for the arrival of the steam-boat, for they are very poor, and\r\nthe little money which the passengers spend, is a great object to them.\r\nOn these occasions the inns are seldom large enough to accommodate all\r\nthe strangers, and then a strange scramble takes place to get lodgings\r\nfor the night. Most of our party succeeded in doing so, and the rest\r\nremained on board the steam-boat.\r\n\r\nWe went to see a beautiful little estate on one side of the harbour of\r\nTobermory, which belongs to the son of the old Laird of Coll, whom Dr.\r\nJohnson visited. The grounds are nearly in the shape of a triangle, and\r\nthe two sides that are away from the sea, are formed by lofty rocks\r\nwith several beautiful waterfalls; and in the middle is a pretty lake.\r\nExcept the house on this estate, there are scarcely any good houses in\r\nor near Tobermory, and the inhabitants are very ignorant and poor. Many\r\nof them who could not speak any other English words, ran after us to\r\nask us for pence and tobacco.\r\n\r\nWe started early in the morning, and passed several small islands of\r\ncurious forms, composed of basalt; one in particular, which is called\r\nthe Dutchman's cap, shaped like this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs we approached Staffa, on the north side, we could see scarcely\r\nanything of the pillars. It appeared a mass of Basalt, of very\r\nirregular shape, rising abruptly out of the sea, scantily covered with\r\ngrass on the upper surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is the south side of the island that is chiefly remarkable, of which\r\nI will show you a picture that I made on the spot.\r\n\r\nIt has (as you may see) exactly the appearance of a great layer of\r\nearth swelling out at the edges, resting on a vast number of pillars\r\nstuck close together. The colour of the pillars is nearly black, and\r\nthat of the stratum above, lightish green, yellow, and brown, from the\r\ngrass and variously coloured lichens that grow upon it. The sea is very\r\ndeep, quite close to the cliffs.\r\n\r\nThe day I was there, was as fine as possible; not a cloud was to be\r\nseen, and the great ocean was as calm as a mill-pond, which is not very\r\ncommon in these parts, for there is mostly a considerable swell.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated cave of Fingal, as it is called, (but why, nobody\r\nknows,) is close to one extremity of the south side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate IX.\r\n\r\nFINGAL'S CAVE]\r\n\r\nIt seems just as if it had been formed by cutting away the middle of\r\nsome of the pillars, since you can see that many parts of the pillars\r\nnow remaining on the roof, are placed as if they were continuations of\r\nthe stumps on which you walk at the bottom.\r\n\r\nWe went into it in a boat, and when we were at the farther end, we got\r\nout upon the broken pillars and surveyed everything at our leisure.\r\n\r\nThe length of the cave is two hundred and fifty feet, the breadth about\r\nforty, and the height above one hundred feet at the entrance, and\r\nseventy at the inner end.\r\n\r\nAlong the middle of the roof, is a deep cleft, or fissure, which makes\r\nit something like a pointed arch, resembling the roof of a cathedral.\r\nThe sides of the fissure are variegated, yellow, red, brown, and white,\r\nin consequence of water containing various substances, soaking through\r\nfrom the surface above; and on each side of it, there are several rows\r\nof the top of the broken pillars, which look quite black.\r\n\r\nOn the sides at the bottom, the stumps form a sort of pavement like\r\nthis, which is an exact copy of a small portion of it, and will show\r\nyou the forms of the pillars; some stand higher than others; but there\r\nis not generally sufficient difference to prevent you from walking over\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBetween these pavements the water is very deep, and as it flows direct\r\nfrom the Atlantic Ocean without any dirty shore or shallows, it looks\r\nvery beautiful,--of a clear emerald green, showing at the bottom\r\nthe black basaltic pillars in ruins, and a very few long luxuriant\r\nsea-weeds gracefully waving with the undulations of the water.\r\n\r\nThe exposed surfaces of the pillars, between high and low water-marks,\r\nare covered with the little shell-fish called _balanus_, or BARNACLE,\r\nof colours varying from pink, which is the hue of those that are placed\r\ndeepest, to yellow and white, which are those that are least covered by\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the cave above these shells, are of a deep slate colour.\r\nThe pillars which compose them, are on the average about three feet\r\nin diameter, and they are fitted so close together that you cannot get\r\na penknife in between them. If separated at certain intervals, they\r\nbreak short off, and leave a remarkably level surface without the least\r\nsplinter. Between these joints they break roughly and irregularly.\r\n\r\nHere is a view of the inside of the cave.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that these wonderful pillars are formed by the cooling\r\nof a melted mass, and that this and other basaltic spots, are the\r\nremains of streams of lava from a volcano long ago extinct.\r\n\r\nIn some of the lava streams of Mount Vesuvius, there has been noticed\r\nan approach to this structure, though not quite so regular as what we\r\nhave been describing.\r\n\r\nYou may understand in some measure how it may come about, by examining\r\nstarch, which always hardens into little columns or pillars; and if\r\nyou look at the little sketch of a portion of the pavement of the cave\r\nwhich I have given you above, you will see that nearly all the pillars\r\nhave six sides, the same as the pieces of starch.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable what pains the basalt seems to have taken to get into\r\na six-sided form. I should think about two-thirds of the columns have\r\nsix sides, though sometimes one side is little more than a sharp edge\r\nblunted, because it seems to have been prevented by its neighbour\r\nmaking a similar effort to get its six sides complete.\r\n\r\nNone of the remaining third of the pillars, have more than nine, or, of\r\ncourse, less than three sides. You might look a long time before you\r\nwould find two pillars exactly alike.\r\n\r\nAll this you will find occurring just in the same manner in starch,\r\nexcept that the edges of the basalt pillars are quite even, while those\r\nof starch are more or less waved or twisted.\r\n\r\nNear the side of the cave there is a little rock formed by pillars into\r\na pretty regular cone, which you may see in the plate. It has a very\r\nstriking appearance as you approach the island.\r\n\r\nClose by the rock there is a little cave, the mouth of which is formed\r\nby bent pillars, in this manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe water in this is not very deep, but it was deep enough to give one\r\nof my companions a good ducking as he was trying to reach a shell which\r\none of the ladies of our party wanted to possess.\r\n\r\nYou will also often see something like these bent pillars in starch.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GIANT'S CAUSEWAY.\r\n\r\nOn the north coast of Ireland, the Giant's Causeway is a collection of\r\nsimilar pillars of rather a smaller size. They stretch far into the\r\nsea, and at low water you may walk a long distance upon the tops of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe pillars get higher as they approach the cliff, and in the cliff\r\nitself, just above them, is a remarkable layer of fossil wood in the\r\nstate called lignite, which closely resembles charcoal.\r\n\r\nAt some distance from the Causeway, some of the pillars stand up by\r\nthemselves, looking just like tall chimneys. There are also some\r\nwonderful caves in the Basaltic cliffs behind it, but none of them\r\nconsisting of pillars like the great cave of Staffa. It is called the\r\nGiant's Causeway, because some people have fancied that it resembled\r\nthe commencement of a great pier or causeway, which some beings of\r\nsuperhuman power had left unfinished. This is only a fancy for poets to\r\ntalk of; you and I are now engaged about facts.\r\n\r\nThere are some similar formations in Iceland, of very great extent, and\r\nin several other parts of the world; but those I have told you about,\r\nare the most remarkable which are known to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nWHY PARLEY BELIEVES THAT THERE IS A GREAT SOURCE OF HEAT WITHIN THE\r\nGLOBE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have attended to what I have already told you, you will\r\nhave seen that there must be a close connection between the causes\r\nof volcanoes, earthquakes, and hot springs, (if they are not all\r\nto be ascribed to one cause,) from their always occurring in the\r\nneighbourhood of each other. But there is something else that you ought\r\nto notice in reference to this connection.\r\n\r\nI said, that a volcanic eruption was almost always preceded by shakings\r\nof the ground round the root of the mountain. These shakings are\r\nsometimes so violent as to be dreadful earthquakes, and at other times\r\nthe earthquake will be at a long distance from the volcano.\r\n\r\nThere was once a great earthquake which kept on for some days on the\r\nnorth shore of South America, and then stopped quite suddenly. It was\r\nafterwards found out, that just at the moment it stopped, a tremendous\r\neruption burst forth from a volcano in one of the West-India islands,\r\nmore than 150 miles off.\r\n\r\nYou know what the safety-valve of a steam-engine is. Now it would seem\r\njust as if volcanoes were safety-valves for the power which causes\r\nearthquakes.\r\n\r\nVery well.--I am now going to tell you what people have thought\r\nthis power has been owing to. Before I do so, that you may not be\r\ndisappointed, I should tell you that we know very little on the\r\nsubject; nor shall we ever know much till somebody can get down to the\r\ncentre of the earth, unless some of the little black spirits, that\r\nthe Rosicrucians called Gnomes, and fabled to live in the middle of\r\nthe globe, should be kind enough to give us some information on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we can only guess; but we ought to guess as well as we\r\ncan, and see whether our guess is not much more likely to be true than\r\nany of the others.\r\n\r\nVolcanic bands are always near the sea-shore, and it has therefore been\r\ngenerally supposed that water has something to do with their action.\r\n\r\nIf you take a mixture of sulphur and iron filings, and mix them into\r\na paste with water, and then bury them in the ground, after a while\r\nthey will become hot and send out a great quantity of steam. Some\r\npeople have imagined that this is the way in which volcanic activity\r\nis produced, but no one thinks so now, and for very good reasons, for\r\nthere is nothing in the action so produced at all capable of accounting\r\nfor long continued eruptions, or for the flowing out of the lava.\r\n\r\nSir Humphrey Davy found out, that nearly all kinds of salt and earth,\r\nwhich had been before looked upon as simple substances, contained\r\ncertain metals united to oxygen, which, (as you should know,) is one\r\nof the parts of water, and, in the form of gas, of the air we breathe.\r\nIf you put a piece of one of these metals into water, it is in such a\r\nhurry to join itself to the oxygen of the water, that you set it on\r\nfire. A little piece of _potassium_, (the metal of the salt called\r\n_potash_, or _pearlash_,) will float for a few moments on the surface\r\nof the water, burning with a purple flame in the prettiest manner\r\nimaginable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSir Humphrey thought he had got the true explanation of the thing.\r\nThese wonderful metals formed the basis of every substance in lava,\r\nand supposing them to exist in the centre of the globe, it was only\r\nnecessary for water to get to them to set them on fire, and thus to\r\ngive rise to earthquakes and volcanoes. It appeared only to be required\r\nthat a crack should be made at the bottom of the sea, and the water\r\nflow into the beds of metal underneath, and the violent action produced\r\nwould burst through the surface, and throw out streams of melted\r\nmatter, accompanied with great clouds of steam, just as takes place in\r\nthe eruptions of Mount Vesuvius and other volcanoes.\r\n\r\nBut you would find it very difficult to think how this can account for\r\ncontinual and nearly steady operations, such as have been known to\r\nexist in the Geysers of Iceland for more than 1000 years, and in Mount\r\nStromboli for much longer than that, so we will try another guess.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed in descending deep mines, that the earth gets\r\nwarmer the deeper you go. The usual mode of trying it is to dig little\r\nholes, as you go down, in the sides and bottom of the mine, and put a\r\nthermometer into them. A great many observations of this kind, have\r\nbeen made in different parts of the world, and the greatest care has\r\nbeen taken to allow for all causes of irregularity, consisting in\r\nclimate and local peculiarities. Comparing these together, it has\r\nbeen determined that the temperature increases about one degree every\r\nfifteen feet of descent.\r\n\r\nA similar conclusion has been drawn from the heat of the water of the\r\nArtesian Wells. But, perhaps, you do not know what Artesian Wells are,\r\nso I will tell you.\r\n\r\nThey are deep borings in the earth, out of which water rises to, or\r\neven above, the surface of the ground. Wherever you bore, if you go\r\ndeep enough you may get plenty of water, and this water is always found\r\nto be warmer in proportion to the depth of the well in which it rises.\r\nThey are called _Artesian Wells_, from _Artois_, a town in France,\r\nwhere the first was constructed.\r\n\r\nIn a well of this kind near Rochelle, which was 316 feet deep, the\r\nwater near the surface was at a temperature of 55 degrees, and at the\r\nbottom 60 degrees. It was afterwards sunk to the depth of 369 feet,\r\nand the temperature at the bottom was then found to be 65 degrees.\r\n\r\nDo you not think it most likely that the heat continues to increase\r\nquite as fast in proportion below the deepest point that man has gone\r\ndown to? Well, if so, at the depth of some miles it must be hot enough\r\nto melt anything, even granite, and all kinds of stones.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose, on this evidence, that the centre of the globe is\r\nintensely heated, and that it gets gradually cooler towards the\r\nsurface, there is what at once will account for the hot springs, the\r\nincreasing heat in descending mines, the constant action of some\r\nvolcanoes, the occasional action of others, the streams of lava, and\r\nthe nature of all substances that are thrown out.\r\n\r\nIt is very natural to imagine that every now and then the action of\r\nthe great heated mass inside, would crack open the crust, and the sea\r\nwearing away its bottom in some places as it does, may have something\r\nto do in assisting this. Thus, new volcanoes would be formed, and\r\nearthquakes would happen where they never happened before; and over\r\nthese immense cracks there would be a volcanic band.\r\n\r\nThen, after a time, these cracks might be partially, or wholly, filled\r\nup by the matter thrown into them, and the volcanoes on the surface\r\nabove may become quiet for a time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nPARLEY TELLS SOMETHING ABOUT THE HISTORY OF MOUNT VESUVIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am going to relate to you the biography of a Volcano, and I hope you\r\nwill find it amusing.\r\n\r\nBefore the time of the Roman Emperor Trajan, Mount Vesuvius had been\r\nquiet for a great many centuries. It is known that it had had many\r\neruptions before then, because there are some great lava streams close\r\nby it, on which some of the most ancient Italian cities are built.\r\nIn particular, Herculaneum, which was said to have been built by\r\nthe Demi-god Hercules, and must therefore have been of the remotest\r\nantiquity, was built chiefly of blocks of lava, and founded upon a\r\nvast stream of the same substance.\r\n\r\nAnd besides, there is no doubt that the land all about the\r\nneighbourhood in the remotest times, bore evident marks of the action\r\nof fire; for it was here that the Poets pretended that the gate of Hell\r\nwas, and close by the black and dreary-looking lake Avernus, which you\r\nmay read about in the Æneid of Virgil. This was also the place where\r\nthe Cimmerians dwelt, whom Ulysses is said to have visited, according\r\nto Homer, on his way to the regions of the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GROTTO DEL CANO.\r\n\r\nNear here, too, was the celebrated Grotto del Cano, the cave which used\r\nto destroy the lives of small animals put into it, by means of the\r\nexhalations that rose from the bottom; but as these exhalations were\r\nheavier than the air, consisting chiefly of the gas called carbonic\r\nacid, they did not rise much above the bottom. This is what an old\r\nwriter, the account of whose travels I am very fond of, says of it.\r\n\r\n\"Whatsoever hath life, being thrust into the farre end, doth die in\r\nan instant. Yet entred it may be a good way with safety; neither\r\nheat nor cold will oppress you, nor is there any damp or vapour to\r\nbe discerned; being perspicuous to the bottome, and the sole thereof\r\ndusty. We made triall with a dog; which we no sooner had thrust in,\r\nbut without crying, or otherwise struggling than if shot to the heart,\r\nhis tongue hung out, and his eyes setled in his head, to our no small\r\namazement. Forthwith drawne out, starke, and to our seeming without\r\nshew of life, we threw him into the lake; when anon he recovered, and\r\nswimming to the shore, ran crying away as fast as hee could, to the\r\nnot farre distant _Osteria_: where they get no small part of their\r\nliving by shewing this place unto forreiners. And it is a sport to see\r\nhow the dogs thereabout will steale away, and scud to the tops of the\r\nmountaines, at the approach of a stranger. The _French_ King _Charles_,\r\nthe eighth of that name, who held the kingdome of _Naples_ for a\r\nwhile; made triall thereof with an Asse, which immediately died. The\r\nlike befell to a foole-hardy souldier. _Peter of Toledo_ caused two\r\noffenders to be thrust thereinto, and both expired in a moment. Nor\r\nfound those three gallants any better successe, who tempted God with\r\ntheir desperate entrance. This place was not unknowne to _Pliny_, who\r\ncalleth it the Cave of _Charon_. The cause of so deadly an effect, is\r\nsaid to proceede from the fervent vapours ascending at invisible pores,\r\nso thin, so dry, and subtile, as not to be discerned: yet thickned by\r\nthe cold that enters at the mouth of the Cave, convert into moisture,\r\nwhich hangs farre within on the roofe like to drops of quick-silver;\r\nand such esteemed to bee by a number. _Carona Pighyus_, desirous to\r\ninforme himselfe in the mysteries hereof, ventured so farre in as\r\nto touch one of those farre of shining drops, and shewed it to his\r\ncompanions, who entred also, and stayed therein about a minute of an\r\nhoure: sensibly perceiving the heat to arise from their feet to their\r\nthighs, till they did sweat at the browes without the endammaging of\r\ntheir senses, who return'd, to the wonder of the guide, that thought\r\nthey had preserved themselves by enchantments. By this their experiment\r\nit appeares that the aire is most deadly neere to the pores where\r\nit first ascended; especially to such creatures as hold their heads\r\ndowneward, exhaling at their nostrils the dry and hote vapours. Thrust\r\na torch neere the bottome, and it will forthwith go out: yet advanced\r\nhigher, re-inflames, which approves the former assertion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE DEATH OF PLINY THE NATURALIST.\r\n\r\nBut although there were such gloomy places in the neighbourhood, in the\r\nreign of Trajan, less than a hundred years after the Christian Era,\r\nMount Vesuvius was clothed with blooming vineyards, and corn fields,\r\nstudded with villas and beautiful gardens, and with three or four rich\r\nand populous cities near its foot.\r\n\r\nThe height of the mountain was then much less than it is at present,\r\nand it seems to have had a broad flat top, nearly surrounded by a ridge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis shape will account for the spot being chosen by the Roman rebel\r\nSpartacus to encamp in, with his gladiators and slaves, when he put\r\nRome in danger.\r\n\r\nFor some time before the first eruption on record, there were dreadful\r\nearthquakes, of which the effects are still to be seen in the cracked\r\nand ruined walls of Pompeii and Herculaneum. \"There were great\r\ndroughts,\" says the historian, \"and violent earthquakes, so that the\r\nwhole plain boiled and bubbled, and the hills leapt, and there were\r\nnoises under ground like thunder, and above ground like roaring; the\r\nseas made a noise, and the Heavens resounded, and then a sudden mighty\r\ncrash was heard, as if the mountains were dashed together; great\r\nstones were then hurled upwards, and were followed by mighty fires,\r\nand immense smoke, so that the whole air was overshadowed, and the sun\r\nquite hidden as in an eclipse.\"\r\n\r\nThe same writer then tells us about some wonderful giants appearing to\r\nwander about the summit of the mountain, which neither you nor I shall\r\nbe ready to believe.\r\n\r\nPliny, the great naturalist, was at that time living at the town of\r\nMisenum, and as he was a man always prying into nature, and wishing\r\nto know the causes of things, you may suppose his curiosity was very\r\nmuch excited by these strange occurrences. But he paid dearly for this\r\nlaudable curiosity, as you shall hear in the account which his nephew\r\nhas left us of the event.\r\n\r\n\"On the 24th of August, about one in the afternoon, my mother desired\r\nhim to observe a cloud which appeared of a very unusual size and shape.\r\nHe had just returned from taking the benefit of the sun, and after\r\nbathing himself in cold water, and taking a slight repast, had retired\r\nto his study. He immediately arose and went out upon an eminence, from\r\nwhence he might more distinctly view this very uncommon appearance.\r\nIt was not at that distance discernible from what mountain this cloud\r\nissued, but it was found afterwards to ascend from Mount Vesuvius. I\r\ncannot give a more exact description of its figure, than by comparing\r\nit to that of a pine-tree, for it shot up a great height in the form\r\nof a trunk, which extended itself at the top into a sort of branches;\r\noccasioned, I imagine, either by a sudden gust of air that impelled\r\nit, the force of which decreased as it advanced upwards, or the cloud\r\nitself being pressed back again by its own weight, expanded in this\r\nmanner: it appeared sometimes bright, and sometimes dark and spotted,\r\nas it was more or less impregnated with earth and cinders. This\r\nextraordinary phenomenon excited my uncle's philosophical curiosity to\r\ntake a nearer view of it. He ordered a light vessel to be got ready,\r\nand gave me the liberty, if I thought proper, to attend him. I rather\r\nchose to continue my studies; for, as it happened, he had given me an\r\nemployment of that kind. As he was coming out of the house, he received\r\na note from Rectina, the wife of Bassus, who was in the utmost alarm at\r\nthe imminent danger which threatened her; for her villa being situated\r\nat the foot of Mount Vesuvius, there was no way to escape but by sea:\r\nshe earnestly entreated him, therefore, to come to her assistance.\r\nHe accordingly changed his first design, and what he began with a\r\nphilosophical, he pursued with an heroical turn of mind. He ordered the\r\ngallies to put to sea, and went himself on board with the intention of\r\nassisting not only Rectina, but several others; for the villas stand\r\nextremely thick upon that beautiful coast. When hastening to the place\r\nfrom whence others fled with the utmost terror, he steered his direct\r\ncourse to the point of danger, and with so much calmness and presence\r\nof mind, as to be able to make and dictate his observations upon the\r\nmotion and figure of that dreadful scene. He was now so nigh the\r\nmountain, that the cinders, which grew thicker and hotter the nearer\r\nhe approached, fell into the ships, together with pumice-stones, and\r\nblack pieces of burning rock: they were likewise in danger, not only of\r\nbeing aground by the sudden retreat of the sea, but also from the vast\r\nfragments which rolled down from the mountain, and obstructed all the\r\nshore. Here he stopped to consider whether he should return back again;\r\nto which the pilot advising him, 'Fortune,' said he, 'befriends the\r\nbrave; carry me to Pomponianus.'\"\r\n\r\nHis nephew then goes on to relate that he joined his friend who was in\r\nanother vessel, and went on shore, where he took a bath and sat down\r\nto supper, not seeming to be in the least alarmed, when everybody\r\nabout him was in the greatest consternation. He then went to sleep so\r\nsoundly, that he was heard to snore. The ashes fell so thick in the\r\ncourt before his apartment, that it was getting nearly impassable, and\r\nhis servants thought proper to awaken him. The walls of the houses\r\nbegan to rock, and he and his friends then resolved to go out into the\r\nfields, lest the stones and bricks should fall upon them. They tied\r\npillows upon their heads, and went out with torches, for though it was\r\ndaytime, the clouds of steam and ashes made it quite dark. They went\r\ndown to the sea, and found it in violent commotion. Either a sudden\r\ngust of wind then brought the effluvia of the volcano towards them, or\r\nelse a little stream of deadly vapour burst out from a crack in the\r\nground, which dispersed the rest of the company. But Pliny, who was a\r\nfat asthmatic old man, had laid down upon the ground to watch what was\r\ngoing on. He attempted to rise, but almost before he had got on his\r\nfeet, he fell down dead.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as it was light again,\" says his nephew, \"which was not till\r\nthe third day after this melancholy accident, his body was found\r\nentire, and without any marks of violence upon it, exactly in the same\r\nposture that he fell.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in the same eruption that the two great cities, Herculaneum and\r\nPompeii were overwhelmed by substances thrown out by the volcano. It\r\ndoes not appear that a single stream of lava flowed out till many years\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nThere were several great eruptions between this time and the year 1306,\r\nand then the volcano was very nearly quiet for more than 300 years.\r\nDuring this time the volcanic power broke out in another place called\r\nPuzzuoli, at several miles distance. After a succession of violent\r\neruptions, the earth was cleft open, and a hill, which is now called\r\nthe Monte Nuovo, was thrown up in the space of a single night, which is\r\n440 feet high, and a mile and a half in circumference.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this period Vesuvius was richly covered with vegetation,\r\neven within the crater. But since the year 1650, there has not been ten\r\nyears pass without an eruption.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe form of the mountain has quite changed, and a little mountain has\r\ngrown up out of the old broad topped one, as you may see in the above\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERCULANEUM AND POMPEII.\r\n\r\nThese cities which were of great extent and importance, seem to have\r\nbeen almost forgotten during more than 1600 years. They are not often\r\nmentioned in Roman history, and, strange to say, the Latin writers who\r\ndescribe the eruption of Vesuvius, by which they must have been buried,\r\nhave said nothing about them, except a very vague allusion or two,\r\nwhich would hardly have attracted any notice, if what I am going to\r\ntell you of, had not happened.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1713, as some people were sinking a well, they discovered\r\ntwo statues, one of Hercules, and the other of Cleopatra; and\r\ncontinuing to dig in several directions, they found they had got into a\r\nRoman theatre, and after a while they discovered that this Theatre was\r\nthat of the City of Herculaneum. But in consequence of the hardness of\r\nthe ground, and the great depth of the city under the surface, which\r\nis one hundred feet, they have only been able to clear out a very few\r\nbuildings, and those cannot be seen except by torchlight, so that very\r\nlittle is known about it.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell you exactly how the ruins of Pompeii were first\r\ndiscovered to be the remains of a city. It appears that an architect,\r\nwho was employed to make a subterranean canal to convey water to the\r\ntown of Torre dell'Annunziata, nearly 300 years ago, met with some\r\nfragments of buildings; and about eighty years afterwards, enough was\r\nseen to convince the discoverers that the ruins were extensive. In the\r\nyear 1755, a regular plan of excavation was commenced, and nearly the\r\nwhole city is now exposed to the light of day.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Pompeii is considerably further from the crater of\r\nVesuvius than that of Herculaneum, and to that circumstance is owing\r\nthe superiority of its preservation, and the greater moveableness of\r\nthe substances which covered it. It is probable that both cities were\r\noriginally assailed by alluvions, or streams of mud, such as I told\r\nyou of some time ago, as well as by showers of cinders and stones. But\r\nwhile Pompeii was only fourteen or fifteen feet below the surface,\r\nand never had anything besides cinders and earth above it, several\r\nstreams of lava flowed over Herculaneum, with layers of the different\r\nsubstances, which the volcano throws into the air, between them, so as\r\nto raise the surface one hundred feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPompeii was three miles in circumference, and was a sea-port town,\r\nthough it is now a full mile from the sea. This is known, because the\r\nsteps which used to lead down from the quay, for the convenience of\r\npassengers going into boats, are still remaining, and so are some large\r\nmetal rings which were intended for cables to be fastened to.\r\n\r\nThere are several inscriptions in both cities commemorating the great\r\ninjuries done by an earthquake which happened in the reign of the\r\nEmperor Nero, sixteen years before they were destroyed. There are also\r\ngreat cracks to be seen in some of the walls, testifying of the same\r\nevent. This was one of the efforts of the volcanic power to get free\r\nbefore Vesuvius became the safety-valve.\r\n\r\nIt is very evident that there was ample warning of the catastrophe\r\nbefore it happened, and that most of the people had time to escape,\r\nfor the number of skeletons found has been but small. In the barracks,\r\nthere were the skeletons of two soldiers chained in the stocks. There\r\nwere seventeen persons found in the cellar of a house just out of the\r\ntown, who seem to have fled there for safety, and the deluge of mud\r\nthen seems to have flowed in upon them, for their bones were found\r\nin hardened mud. One of the number was a woman, with an infant in\r\nher arms, and the impression of her form in the mud, was wonderfully\r\nperfect, though there was nothing left of her but the bones. She seems\r\nto have been the mistress of the house, and a person of consequence,\r\nsince she had a chain of gold about her neck, and rich rings on her\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\nIn these instances, (and there are related several others similar,) the\r\ndestruction of the persons seems to be accounted for by the peculiar\r\ncircumstances in which they were placed. The soldiers, poor fellows,\r\nwould, doubtless, have gone off with their companions, if they had not\r\nbeen in the stocks; and the family of seventeen might have escaped if\r\nthey had fled into the open country, instead of into their cellar.\r\n\r\nThe warning does not however seem to have been very long before the\r\nsad event, perhaps only about an hour. There have recently been found\r\nthree skeletons, which seem to have belonged to a father, mother,\r\nand daughter, (the latter of whom was decorated with pearl-rings and\r\near-rings,) who were in the act of rushing out of their house. And in\r\none of the squares of the city, a traveller saw \"a new altar of white\r\nmarble, exquisitely beautiful, and apparently just out of the hands of\r\nthe sculptor, which had been erected there; an enclosure was building\r\nall round; the mortar, just dashed against the side of the wall, was\r\nbut half spread out; you saw the long sliding stroke of the trowel\r\nabout to return and obliterate its own track--but it never did return:\r\nthe hand of the workman was suddenly arrested, and, after the lapse of\r\n1800 years, the whole looks so fresh and new, that you would almost\r\nsay the mason was only gone to his dinner, and about to come back\r\nimmediately to smooth the roughness.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely that in the early part of the eruption, the ashes\r\nand cinders which the volcano threw out, fell in showers on the\r\ncities, and that the walls were shaken by the subterranean movements,\r\nso that most of the inhabitants thought themselves less in danger in\r\nthe open fields, like the people of Misenum, who went into the fields\r\nwith pillows tied on their heads, as described by Pliny the younger, in\r\nthe passage I quoted just now. Some few others, less afraid of their\r\nhouses tumbling down about their ears, than of the bombs and cinders,\r\nbetook themselves to their cellars, and such places as they thought\r\nsafest.\r\n\r\nI shall now tell you a little of what has been discovered relating to\r\nthe ancient state of the City.\r\n\r\nIts walls were about three miles in circumference; the streets were\r\ngenerally narrow, and paved with great flags of lava, which are\r\nfurrowed by very deep ruts made by the wheels of the carriages that\r\nonce passed busily along them. When the great hardness of the paving\r\nmaterial is considered, this circumstance is very remarkable, and shows\r\nthat the flags must have been laid down for a very long period, for\r\nthe like is not to be seen in the streets of the most ancient City in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X.\r\n\r\nFORUM OF POMPEII.]\r\n\r\nThe Forum was a very elegant building, and if you look in the plate,\r\nyou will see a correct representation of what remains of it. The Forums\r\nof ancient cities were not mere marketplaces, although provisions\r\nand other commodities were offered in them for sale; but they also\r\ncontained places fitted for meetings of the people, and other public\r\nuses. You will thus understand how it was that a place not larger than\r\nPompeii had such an extensive Forum.\r\n\r\nThe names of the owners over the door of each house are still to be\r\nseen, and some of them are perfectly legible; and the colours of the\r\npaintings on the walls of the houses, are as fresh as if they had\r\nbeen painted yesterday. Some books have been found, but they are less\r\nperfect than those in Herculaneum, where a whole library has been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nThe wood of the houses in Herculaneum is astonishingly perfect if\r\nyou just scrape off the surface, and some linen has been discovered,\r\nof which the texture could be distinctly seen. There were also some\r\nvessels full of almonds, chesnuts, and walnuts, in a fruiterer's shop,\r\nwhich preserved their form entire. A baker lived near neighbour to this\r\nfruiterer, and in his shop was a loaf with his stamp upon it, \"ELERIS\r\nQ. CRANI RISER.\" Not far off was an apothecary's shop, in which was a\r\nbox of pills, and a little roll of some kind of medicine ready to be\r\ncut into pills, with a jar of herbs and other medicines. Another shop\r\ncontained some sauces and olives, which were quite moist. These curious\r\nrelics have been sealed up in glass, and placed in the Museum of Naples.\r\n\r\nThere is a house in one of the streets of Pompeii, on one of the walls\r\nof which there has been scratched with some sharp-pointed instrument, a\r\nrude device like this:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe letters in the corner, are, \"_Campani victoria una cum Nucerinis\r\nperistis_.\" _Campanians, you perished in the victory along with the\r\nNucerians._ This was a jest of some merry fellow making fun of the\r\ninhabitants of Nuceria, a neighbouring city, and of some other parts\r\nof Campania, over whom they had gained a victory in a squabble. We are\r\ntold that the Nucerians, when they were dead beaten, went like cowards\r\nto the Emperor Nero, and laid their case before him. He decided in\r\ntheir favour, and punished the Pompeians in what may seem a strange\r\nway to you,--he forbade them to have any amusements in their theatre\r\nfor ten years. However, from what we know of the general disposition\r\nand habits of the ancient Greeks and Romans, this was a very severe\r\npunishment to them. From the scarcity of books, arising from their\r\nbeing copied by hand, instead of being printed, but few of them could\r\nspend their leisure time in reading, as so many of us do now; and in\r\nconsequence of this, the theatre was to them at once the principal\r\nsource of literary improvement and of amusement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XI.\r\n\r\nFALLS OF NIAGARA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPARLEY DESCRIBES THE FALLS OF NIAGARA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe river Niagara runs out of Lake Erie into Lake Ontario, and you may\r\nsee the direction it takes if you look in the map of North America. You\r\nmay likewise observe that Lake Erie is connected with three other vast\r\nLakes, and as its level is lower than theirs, the whole of their waters\r\npass through it into the Niagara.\r\n\r\nNearly half way between the Lakes Erie and Ontario, where the river is\r\nabout three quarters of a mile wide, it tumbles over a precipice of\r\n160 feet in height. I shall try to describe to you what I saw when I\r\nvisited this place; but I am quite certain I shall not be able to do\r\njustice to the scene. You must form your conceptions of it rather from\r\nthe bare facts I tell you respecting the mass of water and the height\r\nof the rocky ledge over which it falls.\r\n\r\nAs we travelled along from the town of Waterloo on a level road on the\r\nwest bank, we saw the river gradually become wider till it was cut into\r\ntwo streams by a long narrow island some miles in length. The streams\r\nafter passing the island, unite into one again, which continues its\r\ncourse as before.\r\n\r\nThere is a sullen unpretending majesty about this part of the river, as\r\nif it did not think it worth while to remind the traveller of the vast\r\ndistance which its mighty waters have come, or of the stupendous scene\r\nto which they are travelling onward. There is nothing remarkable in its\r\nappearance, and that very circumstance, coupled with what we knew and\r\nwhat we shortly expected to see, made us full of intense feeling; and\r\noften and often did we put our ears to the ground to hear whether the\r\nsound of the falls could reach us, and then remount and impatiently\r\nspur on our horses.\r\n\r\nThey say that the roar of the falls may be heard fifteen miles off when\r\nthe wind is favourable. But the day we went, there was hardly any wind,\r\nand we were within six miles of the spot before we heard the sound.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of three miles the waters seemed fretful and\r\ndiscontented, as they approached what are called the rapids; we\r\ncould see afar off \"a silver cloud rising slowly into the sky--the\r\neverlasting incense of the waters,\" consisting of vapour, or rather\r\nfine spray, which is dashed out by the violence of the fall; and the\r\nroar seemed deeper and more tumultuous.\r\n\r\nWithin half a mile the rapids commence in good earnest. A rapid means\r\nthe descent of a river down an inclined bed less sudden than a fall.\r\nThe descent here in half a mile, is fifty feet. The bed is rocky, and\r\nthe waters in rushing over it foam, and eddy, and tear along in all\r\ndirections in which they can possibly approach the awful precipice. The\r\nunity of the stream is broken by thousands of rocks and stones, and\r\nevery part of its broad surface seems earnestly taken up with driving\r\nforward to the falls.\r\n\r\nAfter we had enjoyed this scene awhile, we turned into the road again,\r\nand lost sight of the river till we reached a public-house, where we\r\ntook refreshment and put up our horses.\r\n\r\nThe precipice which here breaks the course of the river, is divided\r\ninto three parts by two large islands, and thus are formed three\r\ndistinct falls. One of these is called the _Great_, or _Horse Shoe\r\nFall_, from its peculiar shape, which you will see represented in the\r\npicture. This is by far the most extensive waterfall in the world, and\r\nis considered to be above a quarter of a mile in length. Then comes an\r\nisland a thousand feet in width, called Goat Island, which has a great\r\ndeal of wood growing on it. After that the Second Fall, not more than\r\ntwenty feet in width, then an island considerably smaller than the\r\nfirst; and lastly, Fort Scloper Fall, about a thousand feet wide, which\r\njoins the opposite bank of the river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water which descends every minute in the three falls,\r\nhas been estimated to be about 700,000 tons.\r\n\r\nWell, a path through the garden of the Inn at which we were, led us\r\ndown a steep and thickly wooded bank, to a complete shelf of rock,\r\nabout a foot in thickness, called the Table Rock, which stands out\r\nover the river.[A] Since I was there this piece of rock has broken away\r\nand fallen into the stream. I was not at all surprised when I heard\r\nthis intelligence, for I can assure you that though I am no coward, it\r\ndid not seem very secure when I was standing on it, and if I had not\r\nbeen quite taken up with what I was looking at, I should not have staid\r\nthere long. Here the whole scene on a sudden broke upon us. We were on\r\na level with the top of the precipice, with the Horse Shoe Fall just\r\nopposite, and to our left, the Second, and Fort Scloper Falls.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The print is copied by the kind permission of Messrs.\r\nAckermann, from one of the elegant series of engravings of the Falls of\r\nNiagara, published by them.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the loud roar and the violent rushing of the waters, the\r\nscene altogether produced on us feelings of deep tranquillity and\r\nbeauty. The portion of the river that falls over the Horse Shoe Fall,\r\ncomes on in such an unbroken mass, as if nothing dared to oppose the\r\nprogress of a single drop of its water. Then the deep transparent green\r\nof the middle stream, showing at a little depth beneath its surface,\r\nshreds of milky foam, the beautiful cloud of fine spray ever decorated\r\nwith a rich rainbow when the sun shines, and the thick woods of Goat\r\nIsland, (the island that limits the Horse Shoe Fall,) are in such\r\nlovely harmony. Altogether, I should say that the scene from the Table\r\nRock, is more remarkable for its beauty than its grandeur, though its\r\ngrandeur is quite equal to that of anything I ever looked upon in my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWe got down to the bottom of the falls by means of some rough steps\r\nwhich have been cut in the rock. As we stood on some large fragments\r\nwhich have fallen down from the cliff above, the roar fell with\r\noverpowering heaviness upon our ears, the fall was nearly hid from our\r\neyes by the spray, and the river rushed past our feet in a terrible\r\ntumult of white foam. By getting along on the stones under the cliff,\r\nwe went in under the fall so as actually to be between the rock and\r\nthe descending sheet of water. Your imagination must tell you better\r\nthan I can, the character of what we then saw by the broken light that\r\nmade its way through the descending mass of waters. We stopped there,\r\noverpowered by indescribable feelings, till we got wet through by the\r\nspray, and then went back to the inn, stored with recollections, which\r\nwill be a feast for us as long as we live.\r\n\r\nA traveller who visited the Falls in winter, adds some particulars\r\nwhich will be interesting to you.\r\n\r\n\"At the time of my visit,\" says he, \"the wind drove the floating ice\r\nout of Lake Erie, with the drift wood of its tributary rivers, and\r\nthese were constantly precipitated over the Falls, but we were not able\r\nto discover any vestiges of them in the eddies below. Immediately in\r\nfront of the sheet of falling water, on the American side, there was\r\nalso an enormous bank of snow, of nearly a hundred feet in height,\r\nwhich the power of the sun had not been fierce enough to dissolve, and\r\nwhich, by giving an Icelandic character to the landscape, produced a\r\nfine effect. It appeared to me to owe its accumulation to the fallen\r\nparticles of frozen spray.\r\n\r\n\"What has been said by Goldsmith, and repeated by others, respecting\r\nthe destructive influence of the rapids above, to ducks and other\r\nwater-fowl, is only an effect of the imagination. So far from being the\r\ncase, the wild duck is often seen to swim down the rapid to the brink\r\nof the Falls, and then fly out, and repeat the descent, seeming to take\r\na delight in the exercise. Neither are small land-birds affected on\r\nflying over the Falls, in the manner that has been stated. I observed\r\nthe blue bird and the wren, which had already made their annual visit\r\nto the banks of the Niagara, frequently fly within one or two feet of\r\nthe brink, apparently delighted with the gift of their wings, which\r\nenabled them to sport over such frightful precipices, without danger.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PART II.\r\n\r\n                          WONDERS OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPARLEY TELLS ABOUT THE FROZEN OCEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour old friend Peter loves to talk about the sea. Ever since he was\r\na child, he loved everything belonging to the sea, and when he was\r\na young man he went many long voyages, and met with many strange\r\nadventures, on the sea. Perhaps he did not find it quite so delightful\r\nto be shut up in the narrow compass of a ship, during long voyages,\r\nas he dreamt he should in his childhood. But he does not now regret\r\nwhatever labours or sufferings he may have endured, for the pleasure he\r\nfinds in telling you of them.\r\n\r\nBut I do not intend here to spin you a yarn (as the sailors say) about\r\nmyself, but merely to describe to you some of the wonderful things I\r\nhave seen during my voyages, that you may love and admire them.\r\n\r\nYou have never seen the sea frozen over in the same manner as you have\r\nseen ponds and rivers in winter. The waters of the sea, everywhere,\r\ncontain a large portion of salt, as you know from their taste, and\r\nthis prevents them from freezing, except where it is very cold. It is\r\nonly near the poles of the earth that the ocean freezes, and there are\r\nlarge masses of ice, both at the north and south poles, which are never\r\nthawed, but stand as stedfast as the everlasting hills of granite.\r\n\r\nIcebergs are large bodies of ice filling the valleys between the high\r\nmountains in northern latitudes. Sometimes they get loosened from the\r\nplaces where they were formed, by parts of them thawing, in seasons\r\nwhich are less cold than usual, and then rush down towards the sea,\r\nwhere they float about in all manner of fantastic and majestic forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Icebergs._]\r\n\r\nThese icebergs are the creation of ages, and annually increase by the\r\nfalling of snows, and of rain, which instantly freezes, and more than\r\nrepairs the loss occasioned by the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nI must tell you a little about the way in which cold converts water\r\ninto ice.\r\n\r\nEverything in nature is expanded or increased in bulk by heat. You\r\nmay see in a thermometer how the quick-silver or the coloured spirit\r\nrises in the tube, because it expands when the instrument is in a\r\nwarm place, and how it sinks in a cold place. It is just the same with\r\nsolids and gases. This would seem to be a universal law of nature,\r\nif it were not for the _single_ exception of water at the moment of\r\nits freezing. If water is cooled down to the freezing point, it will\r\ngradually diminish in bulk, but at the moment it turns into ice, it\r\nseems to spring outward, and increases considerably. In this way\r\nbottles are broken when the water in them freezes; and rocks are often\r\nsplit open in the same manner when the cracks in them contain water.\r\n\r\nYou have seen that ice does not sink in water, but floats upon the\r\nsurface; this takes place, because from the circumstance which I have\r\ntold you, a certain quantity of ice by weight, occupies more space than\r\nthe same quantity of water. Now it is worth while for you to see how\r\nwisely this is arranged, as it respects our own climate and country;\r\nfor if ice were to sink to the bottom, the lakes, and rivers, and\r\nponds, would become solid masses of ice during winter, which the sun's\r\nrays would never thoroughly thaw in summer, because, after the surface\r\nhad been thawed, the rays would have to pass through the water to get\r\nat the ice at the bottom, and thus our climate would be rendered very\r\nmuch colder than it is at present, and perhaps the springs would not\r\ncirculate, so that we should often suffer from scarcity of water.\r\n\r\nBut when the salt water freezes, the ice is very porous, almost like a\r\nhoneycomb, so that it is much lighter than frozen fresh water, and is\r\nvery buoyant upon the sea, and stands out boldly to a great height, as\r\nis represented in the cut of the Icebergs.\r\n\r\nI will tell you of a perilous situation in which I was placed in my\r\nyounger days, when I went a voyage to Greenland in a whale ship. It was\r\nat the end of the fishing season, and our ship was the last but one\r\nof the oil traders left in those seas; we had been very unsuccessful,\r\nhaving only taken five small whales, and we were anxious to amend our\r\nill luck by tarrying after all the other ships had sailed, in hopes\r\nof better success. We were gently sailing about in search of whales\r\namidst the broken ice when there suddenly arose a rather brisk breeze,\r\nat which time our ship was situated between two icebergs,--one of them\r\nvery high and resembling a lofty mountain, and the other considerably\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\nWell, at the time the breeze sprung up, the large iceberg was to the\r\nwindward of us, that is, on that side from whence the wind blew, and\r\nhaving a very large surface which caught the wind, it came sailing\r\ntowards us very fast.\r\n\r\nThe vast bulk of this iceberg sheltered the smaller one, which was\r\nto the leeward of us, so that it did not move in the least, and we\r\nwho were between the two, were completely becalmed. The ship was not\r\nadvancing a knot in an hour, and we could do nothing whatever to help\r\nourselves. We were in the greatest dismay, and could only consider\r\nthe way in which we should meet our entire destruction. The larger\r\nmountain of ice continued to bear down upon us, and in a few minutes\r\nour vessel was crushed between it and the smaller one, as if it had\r\nbeen put in a huge smith's vice.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, for us, the two icebergs clung together, the\r\ngreater one impelling the lesser one forward, and we thus had time to\r\nget out of the ship all our sea-chests, a large quantity of cordage,\r\nnearly all our provisions, and everything portable; but the smaller\r\niceberg soon shifted round the large one and let our ship loose, which\r\ninstantly sank, and we, being on the small iceberg, were left floating\r\non the ocean with despair staring us in the face. Our despair, however,\r\nwas soon put to flight, for we perceived a ship at a short distance, to\r\nwhich we made signal, and they came to our assistance.\r\n\r\nBut, now I come to a part of the event which I grieve to record.--The\r\ncaptain and crew of the vessel which came to our succour, seeing that\r\nwe had no other alternative, thought they could make an easy prey of\r\nus, and before they would consent to save us, required that we should\r\ngive up to them all the things which we had been enabled to rescue\r\nfrom our wrecked ship!--In such circumstances you need not ask what\r\nwe did,--life is sweet, it is said, and the pitiless prospect of the\r\nfrozen regions around us, sharpened our appetite for the enjoyment of\r\nit, and we surrendered all but the clothes in which we stood.\r\n\r\nShall I tell you the place where these savages came from? No. I will\r\nonly tell you that it lies in about 56 degrees North latitude, by 4-1/2\r\nWest longitude; you may, if you please, find its name by looking in the\r\nmap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF A LONG JOURNEY OVER THE ICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Esquimaux live in the most northern parts of America, where there\r\nis hardly anything but ice and snow to be seen from year's end to\r\nyear's end. They build their houses of snow, and make their longest\r\njourneys in sledges upon ice along the sea-shore.\r\n\r\nYou, who have been used to a very different kind of life, may wonder\r\nhow they can enjoy themselves, or even endure existence in such\r\ninhospitable regions. But I can assure you they love their native\r\ncountry so much, that they could by no means be happy out of it; and\r\ntheir pleasures are real pleasures, though they would not be pleasures\r\nto you. And thus you may learn that God wishes everybody to be happy,\r\nand enables them to be so if they choose to act according to the light\r\nwhich He has given them, and not be ever struggling for something which\r\nthey _cannot_, and therefore _ought_ not, to possess.\r\n\r\nAnd not only do the natives of these frozen countries endure perpetual\r\nfrost and snow, but good men have chosen to go and live among them for\r\nthe purpose of teaching the natives the doctrines of Christianity.\r\nI shall relate to you a most interesting narrative of some of these\r\nmen who were Moravians, and it will give you a better notion of the\r\ncharacter of these parts of the world, and of the sort of life men\r\nlead in them, than anything I could you of my own, for the story is\r\nextremely well told.\r\n\r\n\"Brother Samuel Liebisch was entrusted with the general care of the\r\nbrethren's missions on the coast of Labrador, and the duties of his\r\noffice required a visit to Okkak, the most northern of our settlements,\r\nand about one hundred and fifty English miles distant from Nain, the\r\nplace where he resided. Brother William Turner being appointed to\r\naccompany him, they left Nain on March the 11th, 1782, early in the\r\nmorning, with very clear weather, the stars shining with uncommon\r\nlustre. The sledge was driven by the baptized Esquimaux Mark, and\r\nanother sledge with Esquimaux joined company.\r\n\r\n\"An Esquimaux sledge is drawn by a species of dogs, not unlike a wolf\r\nin shape. Like them, they never bark, but howl disagreeably. They\r\nare kept by the Esquimaux in greater or larger packs or teams, in\r\nproportion to the affluence of the master. They quietly submit to be\r\nharnessed for their work, and are treated with little mercy by the\r\nheathen Esquimaux, who make them do hard duty for the small quantity\r\nof food they allow them. This chiefly consists in offal, old skins,\r\nentrails, such parts of whale-flesh as are unfit for other use, rotten\r\nwhale-fins, &c., and if they are not provided with this kind of dogs'\r\nmeat, they leave them to go and seek dead fish or muscles upon the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"When pinched with hunger they will swallow almost anything, and on\r\na journey it is necessary to secure the harness within the snow-house\r\nover night, lest by devouring it, they should render it impossible\r\nto proceed in the morning. When the travellers arrive at their\r\nnight-quarters, and the dogs are unharnessed, they are left to burrow\r\nin the snow, where they please, and in the morning are sure to come\r\nat their driver's call, when they receive some food. Their strength\r\nand speed, even with an hungry stomach, is astonishing. In fastening\r\nthem to the sledge, care is taken not to let them go abreast. They are\r\ntied by separate thongs, of unequal lengths, to an horizontal bar on\r\nthe fore-part of the sledge; an old knowing one leads the way, running\r\nten or twenty paces ahead, directed by the driver's whip, which is of\r\ngreat length, and can be well managed only by an Esquimaux. The other\r\ndogs follow like a flock of sheep. If one of them receives a lash, he\r\ngenerally bites his neighbour, and the bite goes round.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XII.\r\n\r\nESCAPE ON THE ICE]\r\n\r\n\"To return to our travellers: the two sledges contained five men, one\r\nwoman, and a child. All were in good spirits, and appearances being\r\nmuch in their favour, they hoped to reach Okkak in safety in two or\r\nthree days. The tract over the frozen sea was in the best possible\r\norder, and they went with ease at the rate of six or seven miles an\r\nhour. After they had passed the islands in the bay of Nain, they kept\r\nat a considerable distance from the coast, both to gain the smoothest\r\npart of the ice, and to weather the high rocky promontory of Kiglapeit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"About eight o'clock they met a sledge with Esquimaux turning in from\r\nthe sea. After the usual salutation, the Esquimaux alighting, held\r\nsome conversation, as is their general practice, the result of which\r\nwas, that some hints were thrown out by the strange Esquimaux, that it\r\nmight be better to return. However, as the missionaries saw no reason\r\nwhatever for it, and only suspected that the Esquimaux wished to enjoy\r\nthe company of their friends a little longer, they proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"After some time their own Esquimaux hinted that there was a ground\r\nswell under the ice. It was then hardly perceptible, except on lying\r\ndown and applying the ear close to the ice, when a hollow disagreeable\r\ngrating and roaring noise was heard, as if ascending from the abyss.\r\nThe weather remained clear, except towards the east, where a bank of\r\nlight clouds appeared, interspersed with some dark streaks. But the\r\nwind being strong from the North-west, nothing less than a sudden\r\nchange of weather was expected.\r\n\r\n\"The sun had now reached its height, and there was as yet little or\r\nno alteration in the appearance of the sky. But the motion of the sea\r\nunder the ice had grown more perceptible, so as rather to alarm the\r\ntravellers, and they began to think it prudent to keep closer to the\r\nshore. The ice had cracks and large fissures in many places, some\r\nof which formed chasms of one or two feet wide; but as they are not\r\nuncommon even in its best state, and the dogs easily leap over them,\r\nthe sledge following without danger, they are only terrible to new\r\ncomers.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the sun declined towards the west, the wind increased and\r\nrose to a storm, the bank of clouds from the east began to ascend, and\r\nthe dark streaks to put themselves in motion against the wind. The snow\r\nwas violently driven about by partial whirlwinds, both on the ice, and\r\nfrom off the peaks of the high mountains and filled the air. At the\r\nsame time the ground swell had increased so much, that its effect upon\r\nthe ice became very extraordinary and alarming. The sledges, instead\r\nof gliding along smoothly upon an even surface, sometimes ran with\r\nviolence after the dogs, and shortly after seemed with difficulty to\r\nascend the rising hill, for the elasticity of so vast a body of ice, of\r\nmany leagues square, supported by a troubled sea, though in some places\r\nthree or four yards in thickness, would, in some degree, occasion an\r\nundulatory motion not unlike that of a sheet of paper accommodating\r\nitself to the surface of a rippling stream. Noises were now likewise\r\ndistinctly heard in many directions, like the report of cannon, owing\r\nto the bursting of the ice at some distance.\r\n\r\n\"The Esquimaux therefore drove with all haste towards the shore,\r\nintending to take up their night-quarters on the south side of the\r\nNivak. But as it plainly appeared that the ice would break and disperse\r\nin the open sea, Mark advised to push forward to the north of the\r\nNivak, from whence he hoped the track to Okkak might still remain\r\nentire.\r\n\r\n\"To this proposal the company agreed, but when the sledges approached\r\nthe coast, the prospect before them was truly terrific. The ice\r\nhaving broken loose from the rocks, was forced up and down, grinding\r\nand breaking into a thousand pieces against the precipices, with a\r\ntremendous noise, which added to the raging of the wind, and the snow\r\ndriving about in the air, deprived the travellers almost of the power\r\nof hearing and seeing anything distinctly.\r\n\r\n\"To make the land at any risk, was now the only hope left, but it was\r\nwith the utmost difficulty the frightened dogs could be forced forward,\r\nthe whole body of ice sinking frequently below the surface of the\r\nrocks, then rising above it. As the only moment to land was that, when\r\nit gained the level of the coast, the attempt was extremely nice and\r\nhazardous. However, by God's mercy, it succeeded; both sledges gained\r\nthe shore, and were drawn up the beach with much difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"The travellers had hardly time to reflect with gratitude to God on\r\ntheir safety, when that part of the ice from which they had just now\r\nmade good their landing burst asunder, and the water forcing itself\r\nfrom below, covered and precipitated it into the sea. In an instant,\r\nas if by a signal given, the whole mass of ice, extending for several\r\nmiles from the coast, and as far as the eye could reach, began to burst\r\nand be overwhelmed by the immense waves towering above.\r\n\r\n\"The sight was tremendous and awfully grand; the large fields of ice,\r\nraising themselves out of the water, striking against each other, and\r\nplunging into the deep with a violence not to be described, and a noise\r\nlike the discharge of innumerable batteries of heavy guns. The darkness\r\nof the night, the roaring of the wind and sea, and the dashing of the\r\nwaves and ice against the rocks, filled the travellers with sensations\r\nof awe and horror, so as almost to deprive them of the power of\r\nutterance. They stood overwhelmed with astonishment at their miraculous\r\nescape, and even the heathen Esquimaux expressed gratitude to God for\r\ntheir deliverance.\r\n\r\n\"The Esquimaux now began to build a snow-house, about thirty paces from\r\nthe beach; but before they had finished their work, the waves reached\r\nthe place where the sledges were secured, and they were with difficulty\r\nsaved from being washed into the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"About nine o'clock all of them crept into the snow-house, thanking\r\nGod for this place of refuge; for the wind was piercingly cold and so\r\nviolent, that it required great strength to be able to stand against it.\r\n\r\n\"Before they entered this habitation, they could not help once more\r\nturning to the sea, which was now free from ice, and beheld with\r\nhorror, mingled with gratitude, the enormous waves, driving furiously\r\nbefore the wind, like huge castles, and approaching the shore, where\r\nwith dreadful noise, they dashed against the rocks, foaming and filling\r\nthe air with the spray. The whole company now got their supper, and\r\nhaving sung an evening hymn in the Esquimaux language, lay down to rest\r\nabout ten o'clock. They lay so close, that if any one stirred, his\r\nneighbours were roused by it.\r\n\r\n\"The Esquimaux were soon fast asleep, but brother Liebisch could not\r\nget any rest, partly on account of the dreadful roaring of the wind and\r\nsea, and partly owing to a sore throat, which gave him great pain. Both\r\nmissionaries were also much engaged in their minds in contemplating\r\nthe dangerous situations into which they had been brought, and amidst\r\nall thankfulness for their great deliverance from immediate death,\r\ncould not but cry unto their Heavenly Father for his help in this time\r\nof need.\r\n\r\n\"The wakefulness of the missionaries proved the deliverance of the\r\nwhole party from sudden destruction. About two o'clock in the morning,\r\nbrother Liebisch perceived some salt water to drop from the roof of the\r\nsnow-house upon his lips. Though rather alarmed on tasting the salt,\r\nwhich could not proceed from a common spray, he kept quiet, till the\r\nsame dropping being more frequently repeated, just as he was about to\r\ngive the alarm, on a sudden a tremendous surf broke close to the house,\r\ndischarging a quantity of water into it; a second soon followed, and\r\ncarried away the slab of snow placed as a door before the entrance. The\r\nmissionaries immediately called aloud to the sleeping Esquimaux, to\r\nrise and quit the place. They jumped up in an instant, one of them with\r\na large knife cut a passage through the side of the house, and each\r\nseizing some part of the baggage, it was thrown out upon a higher part\r\nof the beach, brother Turner assisting the Esquimaux. Brother Liebisch\r\nand the woman and child fled to a neighbouring eminence. The latter\r\nwere wrapt up by the Esquimaux in a large skin, and the former took\r\nshelter behind a rock, for it was impossible to stand against the wind,\r\nsnow, and sleet. Scarcely had the company retreated to the eminence\r\nwhen an enormous wave carried away the whole house, but nothing of\r\nconsequence was lost.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE JOURNEY OVER THE ICE CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They now found themselves a second time delivered from the most\r\nimminent danger of death; but the remaining part of the night,\r\nbefore the Esquimaux could seek and find another more safe place\r\nfor a snow-house, were hours of great trial to mind and body, and\r\nfilled every one with painful reflections. Before the day dawned, the\r\nEsquimaux cut a hole into a large drift of snow, to screen the woman\r\nand child, and the two missionaries.\r\n\r\n\"Brother Liebisch, however, could not bear the closeness of the air,\r\nand was obliged to sit down at the entrance, where the Esquimaux\r\ncovered him with skins, to keep him warm, as the pain in his throat was\r\nvery great.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as it was light, they built another snow-house, and miserable\r\nas such an accommodation is at all times, they were glad and thankful\r\nto creep into it. It was about eight feet square and six or seven feet\r\nhigh. They now congratulated each other on their deliverance, but found\r\nthemselves in a very bad plight.\r\n\r\n\"The missionaries had taken but a small stock of provisions with them,\r\nmerely sufficient for the short journey to Okkak. Joel, his wife and\r\nchild, and Kassigiak, the sorcerer, had nothing at all. They were\r\nobliged, therefore, to divide the small stock into daily portions,\r\nespecially as there appeared no hopes of soon quitting this place and\r\nreaching any dwellings. Only two ways were left for this purpose,\r\neither to attempt the land passage across the wild and unfrequented\r\nmountain Kiglapeit, or wait for a new ice track over the sea, which it\r\nmight require much time to form; they therefore resolved to serve out\r\nno more than a biscuit and a half per day.\r\n\r\n\"But as this would not by any means satisfy an Esquimaux's stomach, the\r\nmissionaries offered to give one of their dogs to be killed for them,\r\non condition, that in case distress obliged them to resort again to\r\nthat expedient, the next dog killed should be one of the Esquimaux's\r\nteam. They replied that they should be glad of it, if they had a kettle\r\nto boil the flesh in, but as that was not the case, they must even\r\nsuffer hunger, for they could not, even now, eat dogs' flesh in its raw\r\nstate. The missionaries now remained in the snow-house, and every day\r\nendeavoured to boil so much water over their lamp, as might serve for\r\ntwo dishes of coffee a-piece. Through mercy, they were preserved in\r\ngood health, and brother Liebisch quite unexpectedly recovered on the\r\nfirst day of his sore throat. The Esquimaux also kept up their spirits,\r\nand even the rough heathen Kassigiak declared, that it was proper to\r\nbe thankful that they were still alive, adding, that if they had\r\nremained a very little longer upon the ice yesterday, all their bones\r\nwould have been broken to pieces in a short time. He had, however,\r\nhis heels frozen, and suffered considerable pain. In the evening, the\r\nmissionaries sung an hymn with the Esquimaux, and continued to do it\r\nevery morning and evening. God was present with them, and comforted\r\ntheir hearts by his peace.\r\n\r\n\"Towards noon of the thirteenth, the weather cleared up and the sea\r\nwas seen, as far as the eye could reach, quite freed from ice. Mark\r\nand Joel went up the hills to reconnoitre, and returned with the\r\ndisagreeable news that not a morsel of ice was to be seen even from\r\nthence, in any direction, and that it had even been forced away from\r\nthe coast at Nuasornak. They were, therefore, of opinion, that we could\r\ndo nothing but force our way across the mountain Kiglapeit.\r\n\r\n\"To-day Kassigiak complained much of hunger, probably to obtain from\r\nthe missionaries a larger portion than the common allowance. They\r\nrepresented to him, that they had no more themselves, and reproved him\r\nfor his impatience. Whenever the victuals were distributed, he always\r\nswallowed his portion very greedily, and put out his hand for what he\r\nsaw the missionaries had left, but was easily kept from any further\r\nattempt by serious reproof.\r\n\r\n\"The Esquimaux eat to-day an old sack made of fish-skin, which proved\r\nindeed a dry and miserable dish. While they were at this singular\r\nmeal, they kept repeating, in a low humming tone, 'you was a sack but\r\na little while ago, and now you are food for us.' Towards evening\r\nsome flakes of ice were discovered driving towards the coast, and on\r\nthe fourteenth in the morning, the sea was covered with them. But the\r\nweather was again very strong, and the Esquimaux could not quit the\r\nsnow-house, which made them very low spirited and melancholy. Kassigiak\r\nsuggested, that it would be well to attempt to make good weather, by\r\nwhich he meant to practise his art, as a sorcerer, to make the weather\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\"The missionaries opposed it, and told him that his heathenish\r\npractices were of no use, but that the weather would become favourable\r\nas soon as it should please God. Kassigiak then asked, whether _Jesus_\r\ncould make good weather. He was told, that to _Jesus_ was given all\r\npower in heaven and earth; upon which he demanded, that he should\r\nbe applied to. Another time he said, I shall tell my countrymen at\r\nSeglek. The missionaries replied. 'Tell them that in the midst of this\r\naffliction, we placed our only hope and trust in Jesus Christ our\r\nSaviour, who loves all mankind, and has shed his blood to redeem them\r\nfrom eternal misery.'\r\n\r\n\"To-day the Esquimaux began to eat an old, filthy, and worn-out skin,\r\nwhich had served them for a mattress.\r\n\r\n\"On the fifteenth the weather continued extremely boisterous, and the\r\nEsquimaux appeared every now and then to sink under disappointment.\r\nBut they possess one good quality, namely, a power of going to sleep\r\nwhen they please, and, if need be, they will sleep for days and nights\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\"In the evening the sky became clear, and their hopes revived. Mark\r\nand Joel went out to reconnoitre, and brought word that the ice had\r\nacquired a considerable degree of solidity, and might soon be fit for\r\nuse. The poor dogs had, meanwhile, fasted for nearly four days, but\r\nnow in the prospect of a speedy release, the missionaries allowed to\r\neach a few morsels of food. The temperature of the air having been\r\nrather mild, it occasioned a new source of distress, for by the warm\r\nexhalations of the inhabitants, the roof of the snow-house got to be in\r\na melting state; which occasioned a continual dropping, and by degrees\r\nmade every thing soaking wet. The missionaries report, that they\r\nconsidered this the greatest hardship they had to endure, for they had\r\nnot a dry thread about them, nor a dry place to lie down in.\r\n\r\n\"On the sixteenth early, the sky cleared, but the fine particles of\r\nsnow were driven about like clouds. Joel and Kassigiak resolved to\r\npursue their journey to Okkak, by the way of Nuasornak, and set out,\r\nwith the wind and snow full in their faces. Mark could not resolve to\r\nproceed farther north, because, in his opinion, the violence of the\r\nwind had driven the ice off the coast at Tikkerasuk, so as to render it\r\nimpossible to land; but he thought he might yet proceed to the south\r\nwith safety, and get round Kiglapeit. The missionaries endeavoured to\r\npersuade him to follow the above mentioned company to Okkak, but it was\r\nin vain; and they did not feel at liberty to insist upon it, not being\r\nsufficiently acquainted with the circumstances. Their present distress\r\ndictated the necessity of venturing something to reach the habitations\r\nof men, and yet they were rather afraid of passing over the newly\r\nfrozen sea under Kiglapeit, and could not immediately determine what to\r\ndo. Brother Turner therefore went again with Mark to examine the ice,\r\nand both seemed satisfied that it would hold. They therefore came at\r\nlast to a resolution to return to Nain.\r\n\r\n\"On the seventeenth, the wind had considerably increased, with heavy\r\nshowers of snow and sleet, but they set off at half-past ten o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon. Mark ran all the way round Kiglapeit, before the sledge,\r\nthat he might find a good track, and about one o'clock, they were quite\r\nout of danger and reached the bay. Here they found a good track upon\r\nsmooth ice, made a meal of the remnant of their provisions, and got\r\nsome warm coffee. Thus refreshed, they resolved to proceed without\r\nstopping, till they reached Nain, where they arrived at twelve o'clock\r\nat night.\r\n\r\n\"The brethren at Nain rejoiced exceedingly to see them return, for by\r\nseveral hints of the Esquimaux, who first met them going out to sea,\r\nand who then in their own obscure way, had endeavoured to warn them\r\nof their danger of the ground-swell, but had not been attended to,\r\ntheir fellow-missionaries, and especially their wives, had been much\r\nterrified. One of these Esquimaux, whose wife had made some article of\r\ndress for brother Liebisch, whom they called Samuel, addressed her in\r\nthe following manner:--'I should be glad of the payment for my wife's\r\nwork.' 'Wait a little,' answered sister Liebisch, 'and when my husband\r\nreturns he will settle with you, for I am unacquainted with the bargain\r\nmade between you.' 'Samuel and William,' replied the Esquimaux, 'will\r\nnot return any more to Nain.' 'How not return! what makes you say so?'\r\nAfter some pause the Esquimaux replied in a low tone, 'Samuel and\r\nWilliam are no more! all their bones are broken, and in the stomachs of\r\nthe sharks.'\r\n\r\n\"Terrified at this alarming account, sister Liebisch called in the\r\nrest of the family, and the Esquimaux was examined as to his meaning;\r\nbut his answers were little less obscure. He seemed so certain of the\r\ndestruction of the missionaries, that he was with difficulty prevailed\r\non to wait some time for their return. He could not believe that they\r\ncould have escaped the effects of so furious a tempest, considering the\r\ncourse they were taking.\r\n\r\n\"It may easily be conceived, with what gratitude to God the whole\r\nfamily at Nain bid them welcome. During the storm, they had considered\r\nwith some dread, what might be the fate of their brethren, though at\r\nNain its violence was not felt so much as on a coast, unprotected by\r\nany islands. Added to this, the hints of the Esquimaux had considerably\r\nincreased their apprehensions for their safety, and their fears began\r\nto get the better of their hopes. All therefore joined most fervently\r\nin praise and thanksgiving to God, for this signal deliverance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE WHALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that the largest animal in nature should live in\r\nthese regions, where you would think everything must be starved by the\r\ncold. But so it is, and it should lead you to reflect, how wonderfully\r\nthe principle which animates living beings, by the outward form and\r\nconstitution which it gives to the bodies of animals, adapts them to\r\nsupport the various circumstances in which they are placed.\r\n\r\nThere are many kinds of whale which all agree in these particulars.\r\nThey are very much larger than any other creatures existing; they live\r\nin the sea and yet suckle their young with milk, and have warm blood\r\nand lungs like land animals, so that they can only breathe by putting\r\ntheir heads above water. Some people have doubted whether it was proper\r\nto call the whale a fish, but on the whole it is certainly more like\r\nfishes than it is like any other of the great divisions of animals,\r\nseeing that it swims with fins, and cannot live out of the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Greenland whale (naturalists call it _Balena Mysticetus_,) is the\r\nmost important of the varieties, as it is the one which produces train\r\noil in the largest quantities, and whalebone. In common with all the\r\nothers, it is a most awkward looking creature. Here is a picture of\r\none. Its usual length is from 40 to 60 feet; and the circumference of\r\nits body about 40. It not unfrequently weighs 60 or 70 tons, which is\r\nmore than the weight of 180 fat oxen.\r\n\r\nThe tail is commonly about 6 feet long, and 25 feet wide. It lies flat\r\nupon the water, and is what the creature principally uses in swimming,\r\nfor the fins near the head appear to be used merely to keep the body\r\nsteady in the water. It is also a weapon of defence, and possesses\r\nprodigious strength, as you shall hear by and by.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the mouth is, perhaps, the most wonderful part of the\r\nwhale, both from its size and construction. I was once in one, which\r\nwas 15 feet in length and 7 feet wide.\r\n\r\nIt is from the mouth that the _Whalebone_, as it is called, comes.\r\nThe jaws are not furnished with teeth, but in their place there is\r\nsomething which forms a curious sort of shrimp-trap, which I will\r\ndescribe to you. The whalebone is ranged along in blades upon the jaws,\r\nlike the laths of a Venetian blind, and the inner edge of each blade\r\nis furnished with a fringe of fibrous stuff almost like hair.\r\n\r\nThe natural position of the whale's mouth seems to be open, and it\r\nmostly swims along or lies near the surface, with its lower jaw hanging\r\ndown. Little fish and insects, most of them of the smallest size,\r\nthus come in contact with the smooth edge of the blades of bone, slip\r\nbetween them, and become entangled in the hairy fringe of the inner\r\nedge, so that they can never get out again. When the whale thinks he\r\nhas got enough in his mouth, he immediately raises his enormous lower\r\njaw and swallows. One of his mouthfuls must often consist of millions\r\nof living creatures, respecting the kinds of which I shall have\r\nsomething to tell you in a future page.\r\n\r\nI told you that he was obliged to rise to the surface of the water to\r\nbreathe. You would like to see him ascend for this purpose, and snort\r\nout a jet of thick vapour to the height of twenty feet, or more, and\r\nmaking such a noise, as may be heard at a distance of several miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nUnder the skin, all over the body, there is a covering of yellowish\r\nfat of about a foot thick, which keeps the animal warm, answering the\r\nsame purpose as the fur does on land animals. It is necessary, because\r\nthe whale is not cold in the inside like other fish, but has warm,\r\nred blood, which is of a higher temperature even than that of a human\r\nbeing. This is another circumstance which becomes the more remarkable\r\nfrom the cold climate in which he lives.\r\n\r\nThis fat is generally called blubber, and is what the oil comes from.\r\nWhen first it is taken from the whale, it has not the least unpleasant\r\nsmell, and it is not till the cargo is unstowed that a whale ship is at\r\nall disagreeable.\r\n\r\nThe largest sort of whale is called the _razor back_, from a ridge that\r\nruns along his back. They are often 100 feet in length. I never saw one\r\nof these taken, but the sailors told me that they were very difficult\r\nto come near, and after all, not worth the trouble of killing, for they\r\nhave very little blubber.\r\n\r\nThen there is the Cachalot, or Sperm Whale, which is smaller, and much\r\nmore slender than the common whale. It has teeth, and is of a very\r\nquarrelsome temper. It often fights with its own kind, and I have seen\r\nseveral of them which had been wounded in the jaws, and made blind by\r\nsuch conflicts. It is from the head of this animal that spermaceti is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nA number of vessels are sent out every year to catch these great\r\ncreatures, and this is the way in which they manage their work. Every\r\nvessel is furnished with five or six boats which are hung on the sides\r\nof the vessel in such a way as to be easily lowered into the water on\r\nthe shortest notice. One or two of the boats are usually kept upon the\r\nlook out, in each of which there is a harpoon attached to a rope above\r\n700 feet in length, and about as thick as a man's thumb. This is the\r\nshape of the harpoon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen they see a whale showing himself above the surface of the water,\r\nthe man who is to throw the harpoon, stations himself at the bow, and\r\nthe rest pull away as fast as they are able till they approach the\r\nwhale as near as possible, and this is often to within a very short\r\ndistance in consequence of his being slower of hearing than most other\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe harpooner then throws the harpoon with all his might, and if he\r\nis lucky, it goes through the poor creature's skin and blubber, into\r\nhis flesh. The moment he feels the wound, he mostly sinks to a great\r\ndepth, and drags out the line which is carefully coiled at the bottom\r\nof the boat, at a tremendous rate. One man stands by with a mop to keep\r\nthe edge of the boat over which the rope runs constantly wet, lest\r\nthe friction should set the boat on fire, and another holds a hatchet\r\nready to chop it in two in case it should become entangled. If it goes\r\nout smoothly, they add lines as long as they are necessary: and on\r\none occasion, for a whale which was very refractory, Captain Scoresby\r\nactually joined together three miles and three quarters of rope, the\r\nweight of which was nearly two tons! Was not this a great fishing-line?\r\n\r\nAs soon as the whale is struck, they hoist a flag, and the men who are\r\nin the ship, and constantly upon the look out, immediately come to\r\ntheir assistance. If the signal is made when any of them are asleep, up\r\nthey come with their clothes under their arms, and dress afterwards\r\nas they can, for not a moment is to be lost. This is no joke, when the\r\ncold is more than thirty degrees below the freezing point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHowever, they are obliged to go; and as many boats as there may be,\r\nthen watch anxiously for the re-appearance of the whale on the surface.\r\nAs soon as he shows himself, the men of the other boats immediately\r\nstrike their harpoons into him, and so secure him till he is faint from\r\nloss of blood, and at last comes up to the surface, spouting out blood\r\nmixed with the vapour from his nostrils. They then despatch him with an\r\ninstrument called a lance, and the great carcass rolls over upon its\r\nback. It is afterwards lashed by strong ropes to the side of the ship,\r\nand the blubber is cut up into lumps of convenient size, and stowed in\r\ncasks.\r\n\r\nIt occasionally happens, after the harpooner has thrown his weapon,\r\nthat the creature in agony, flaps about his tail with tremendous\r\nviolence before he goes down. Many boats have been upset in this\r\nmanner, and Captain Scoresby relates an instance of a boat being dashed\r\ncompletely in two.\r\n\r\nSome people have thought the whale a very stupid creature, but there\r\ndoes not seem much ground for this notion, though we can never be in a\r\ncondition to see much of its instinctive wisdom. As far as we can see,\r\nit is the very best thing it could do when struck by the harpoon, to\r\ngo downwards as it does; and this seems to prove that it has quite its\r\nshare of intelligence; and it is still more remarkable, that if a mass\r\nof ice be near when it is pursued, either before or after it has been\r\nstruck, it gets under it as quickly as possible, and often thus baffles\r\nits pursuers.\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting thing in the character of the whale is, its\r\nextreme love for its offspring, and a cruel use is often made by the\r\nwhalers of this beautiful disposition. They often strike a _cub_ or\r\n_sucker_, as they call the young whales, which would not be worth\r\ntaking itself, because they know its mother will instantly expose\r\nherself to an attack in its defence. You shall hear what Captain\r\nScoresby says on this, \"When the young whale is struck, its mother\r\njoins it at the surface of the water, whenever it has occasion to\r\nrise for respiration; encourages it to swim off; assists its flight,\r\nby taking it under her fin; and seldom deserts it while life remains.\r\nShe is then dangerous to approach; but affords frequent opportunities\r\nfor attack. She loses all regard for her own safety, in anxiety for\r\nthe preservation of her young;--dashes through the midst of her\r\nenemies;--despises the danger that threatens her;--and even voluntarily\r\nremains with her offspring, after various attacks on herself from the\r\nharpoons of the fishers. In June 1811, one of my harpooners struck a\r\nsucker, with the hope of its leading to the capture of the mother.\r\nPresently she arose close by the 'fast-boat;' and seizing the young\r\none, dragged about a hundred fathoms of line out of the boat with\r\nremarkable force and velocity. Again she arose to the surface; darted\r\nfuriously to and fro; frequently stopped short, or suddenly changed her\r\ndirection, and gave every possible intimation of extreme agony. For a\r\nlength of time she continued thus to act, though closely pursued by the\r\nboats; and, inspired with courage and resolution by her concern for her\r\noffspring, seemed regardless of the danger which surrounded her. At\r\nlength, one of the boats approached so near, that a harpoon was hove at\r\nher. It hit, but did not attach itself. A second harpoon was struck;\r\nthis also failed to penetrate: but a third was more effectual, and\r\nheld. Still she did not attempt to escape, but allowed other boats to\r\napproach; so that, in a few minutes, three more harpoons were fastened;\r\nand, in the course of an hour afterwards, she was killed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nA VOYAGE ON A TROPICAL SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo you, my little friends, who have always lived in a climate in which\r\nit seems as if the wind changed, and it became sun-shiny or cloudy, wet\r\nor dry, cold or hot, without any law or regularity, it is something\r\nstrange to hear of places where the inhabitants know almost to a day\r\nthat the wind will blow constantly in one direction during so many\r\nmonths in the year, and constantly in some other direction during the\r\nrest: and where, with equal certainty, they know when to expect rain\r\nand when fine weather.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, our changeable weather is under the influence of laws\r\nquite as certain and fixed as their uniform weather is, only that there\r\nare more partial causes operating in our climate, so that the effects\r\nare not so strictly periodical. We know as little about the way in\r\nwhich the laws operate in one case, as in the other.\r\n\r\nThe winds that always blow in one direction are called the Trade Winds,\r\nand those which blow in one direction regularly during a certain\r\nportion of the year, are called monsoons. They make navigation in some\r\nparts of the ocean, very certain, and you cannot think how odd it seems\r\nto a young sailor the first time he sails in them. He leads then a\r\nlazy sort of life; there is no tacking about, but day after day he has\r\nnothing to do but just such things as might be done on land.\r\n\r\nWhen the sailors of Columbus first found themselves in the Trade Wind\r\nblowing from the eastward, having sailed before it for many days, they\r\ngave themselves up to despair, because they thought they should never\r\nbe able to make their way back against it to their dear native country.\r\nThey did not know that it would by and by blow quite as certainly in\r\nanother direction.\r\n\r\nThese uniform winds blow only within a certain distance of the equator,\r\nand the cause of them is this. The heat of the climate there occasions\r\nthe air next to the surface of the earth to be always ascending, and\r\nother air rushes in from other parts of the world to supply its place.\r\nThe motion of the earth upon its axis operates with this, by bringing\r\nthe parts of its surface successively in contact with any certain point\r\nin the atmosphere, which does not revolve so rapidly as the earth\r\nitself, and a fixed direction is thus given to the wind.\r\n\r\nBut it is still much more dull to find one's self in a calm on a\r\ntropical sea. Only imagine to yourselves a stagnant and shoreless\r\nsea, often with unsightly masses of sea-weed floating on it, a sky\r\nconstantly of a gloomy-looking red, and nothing to be seen day after\r\nday except this sky and sea; insupportable thirst and bad water to\r\nquench it, and the ship all the time rocking to and fro with a nasty\r\ndull motion, and the ropes and sails idly flapping against the mast and\r\nyards.\r\n\r\nBut though I have seen and felt all this, I cannot describe it to you\r\nso well as the poet, so I will give you his words.\r\n\r\n   \"Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,\r\n      'Twas sad as sad could be,\r\n    And we did speak only to break\r\n      The silence of the sea.\r\n\r\n    \"All in a hot and copper sky,\r\n      The bloody sun at noon,\r\n    Right up above the mast did stand\r\n      No bigger than the moon.\r\n\r\n    \"Day after day, day after day,\r\n      We stuck, nor breath nor motion;\r\n    As idle as a painted ship\r\n      Upon a painted ocean.\r\n\r\n    \"Water, water, everywhere,\r\n      And all the boards did shrink;\r\n    Water, water, everywhere,\r\n      Nor any drop to drink.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE WATER-SPOUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell! one morning when we were only a few leagues off the West Coast of\r\nAfrica, to the South of the Cape Verd Islands, we thought we were going\r\nto have just such a calm as the poet has described. There had been a\r\nviolent storm during the night, but every breath of wind had died away,\r\nand left a long sleepy swell upon the sea.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o'clock, we noticed a cloud rising, or rather seeming to\r\nform, at some distance from us, and just below it a white spot of foam\r\nappeared on the surface of the water, and the waves raged over a little\r\nround space in a way that made me feel I don't know how, for I had\r\nnever seen such a thing before. The cloud grew blacker and blacker, and\r\npresently seemed to move down towards the sea and swell out in the same\r\ndirection, as if to provoke the waves below, which seemed straining up\r\ntowards it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIII.\r\n\r\nWATER SPOUTS]\r\n\r\nThere suddenly seemed to grow out of the middle of the spot of waves,\r\na complete pillar of water of a tapering shape, and at the same moment\r\nthe lower part of the cloud seemed to condense and turn to water, and\r\nshot downwards in a cone to meet it. They united and formed one pillar,\r\nalmost as distinct as if it had been of ice instead of water. You will\r\nsee a correct representation of this in the picture.\r\n\r\nThe size at the base must have been very large, not less than 250 feet\r\nin diameter, but it tapered off so much that at the middle it was not\r\nmore than three or four feet. Above the middle it increased in size,\r\nand its solidity seemed to get gradually less till it ended in a great\r\nblack cloud. Its height might have been about 700 feet.\r\n\r\nIts form changed considerably. It generally seemed as if it was\r\ncomposed of water sucked upwards in a spiral direction, and looked\r\nalmost like a great cable; but now and then it looked like a simple\r\nhollow tube.\r\n\r\nSometimes it inclined a little one way, and then another; and sometimes\r\nit was very considerably bent, and then suddenly straightened itself\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWhen the ship was nearest to it, we heard a noise from it like the\r\nrushing of a waterfall, and before it was over, heavy rain came on with\r\nlightning, but no thunder. The wind all the time was very unsteady,\r\nthough it was not violent.\r\n\r\nWhile we were looking at it, two smaller ones formed at some distance\r\nunder very nearly the same circumstances. One of them stood quite still\r\nfor some seconds, and then disappeared; but the other moved steadily on\r\nin a straight line, for several minutes.\r\n\r\nThe great one continued moving also very slowly for nearly half an\r\nhour, and then seemed to snap in two, and one half sank rapidly into\r\nthe sea, as if it had been unhooked from above, and the other half\r\nremained hanging from the cloud for some time, and then curled upwards\r\nand disappeared, throwing down a heavy torrent of rain.\r\n\r\nI have seen many water-spouts since, in my voyages over the great\r\nocean, but have never been so struck with the appearance of any one as\r\nof this.\r\n\r\nThere is a common notion that a cannon fired at a water-spout, will\r\ndisperse it by making a great concussion of the air; but I do not\r\nthink that this is true, unless the water-spout be very small. At all\r\nevents, it was not true in this case, for we fired right at the large\r\none several times, and it took no effect except in splashing the water\r\nabout as the ball went through.\r\n\r\nIt is also generally imagined that they are very dangerous to ships,\r\nand if they come close, that they throw such a quantity of water into\r\nthem as to sink them. I have somewhere read an account of a vessel\r\nhaving once been put in danger by one off the Coast of Guinea, and two\r\nor three of the men being washed overboard, and I once saw the sails\r\nand deck of a vessel, made very wet by a small one, myself. But my own\r\nopinion is, that there is not much to be dreaded from them, for they\r\nare not a solid mass of water, but merely condensed vapour in the form\r\nof a tube, with a hollow space in the middle. And I think if you were\r\nright under one of them, it would be no worse than rain descending in\r\nvery large drops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOnce I saw a much smaller water-spout on land. It was a gusty, cloudy\r\nday, and the wind had changed several times, when a dark cloud at some\r\ndistance from where I was, extended downwards till it came nearly to a\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to reach about three-fourths of the distance from the cloud\r\nto the ground, and moved along slowly for about ten minutes. When I\r\nafterwards made inquiry of the people over whose houses it passed, they\r\ntold me that it had let fall in its progress a tremendous quantity of\r\nrain, so as considerably to injure several houses.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW PARLEY SUPPOSES WATER-SPOUTS TO BE CAUSED.\r\n\r\nI suppose you would now like me to tell you how water-spouts are\r\ncaused. I wish I could, for your sakes; and, besides, I should very\r\nmuch like to know myself. I have, however, a tolerable guess upon the\r\nsubject, and that I will tell you of.\r\n\r\nI dare say you have often seen little eddies of wind which take up\r\ndust, straw, and other light substances, and carry them up, twirling\r\nthem round in a spiral direction like a cork-screw.\r\n\r\nWhen these occur on a larger scale, they are called whirlwinds, and are\r\noften very destructive in their effects, unroofing houses, and doing\r\nvarious other mischief. They are sometimes occasioned by draughts of\r\nair being disturbed in their course by mountains or hills, and meeting\r\neach other. But the largest are caused by two or more currents of wind,\r\nproduced by what ordinarily influences the direction of the wind,\r\nmeeting from different quarters, and then twisting round each other\r\njust as two strings, with weights at their ends, would do if you swung\r\nthem forcibly together so as to meet about the middle.\r\n\r\nA whirlwind occurred some years ago, near where I was living; it lasted\r\nabout ten minutes, and produced some very curious effects. It first met\r\nwith a milk-maid, who was carrying a pail of milk upon her head, and\r\ntore off her bonnet along with the pail, and carried both to a great\r\ndistance, where they were not found till some days afterwards. It next\r\ntwisted a wagon in pieces, and blew most of the fragments over a wall;\r\nit unroofed a house, and carried some of the tiles to a great distance;\r\nnext it dashed through the window of the room where I was sitting,\r\nswept all the ornaments off the mantelpiece, and made strange havock\r\nwith some of the furniture. It then passed on to a neighbouring park,\r\nwhere it tore up several trees. The wind had not been extremely violent\r\nbefore, neither was it immediately afterwards.\r\n\r\nSuppose a cloud happens to be exactly in the point of union of two\r\ncurrents of wind, meeting as they did in this whirlwind, it then\r\nbecomes twisted in along with them, and partially condensed; and if\r\nit is over the land, this is all that seems necessary to form the\r\nwater-spout.\r\n\r\nAnd if it happens to be over the sea, the wind, as it eddies round,\r\nworks up the waves into a ferment, and much spray and foam is produced,\r\nwhich is twisted in with the whirlwind in the same manner as the cloud,\r\nand carried upwards to meet it.\r\n\r\nWhether this is just the way in which the thing takes place, or not,\r\nit is pretty certain that the water-spout is caused by the meeting of\r\nwinds from various quarters, from what Dr. Franklin tells us in one of\r\nhis letters which I read the other day. He says that a sailor informed\r\nhim that he was in one of three vessels which chanced to be placed as\r\nat the three corners of a triangle; a water-spout was formed between\r\nthem which seemed to be to the leeward of each of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe cut will enable you to understand what I mean. The star in the\r\nmiddle represents the water-spout, and the three arrows the directions\r\nin which each of the three vessels found the wind come, which shows\r\nthat three diverse currents of air all set towards the water-spout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nCORAL REEFS AND ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we were sailing through the Pacific Ocean, I saw a great many\r\ncoral reefs and islands; and perhaps there is hardly one of the\r\nwonderful things which I have seen in my travels, that I remember with\r\nmore pleasure, or love more to think about, so I shall be glad to tell\r\nyou all I know of them.\r\n\r\nYou are acquainted with the appearance of Coral, as you have often seen\r\npieces of it in cabinets, and employed as ornaments; and you therefore\r\nknow that it always abounds with little holes, but its form, and the\r\nshape of these holes, vary considerably. Some of it occurs in branches,\r\nlike the branches of trees, and in consequence of this, and because\r\nit was known to increase in size from time to time, it was taken for a\r\nmarine plant, before its nature was fully investigated. The openings\r\nin this sort are placed in the form of stars, as you will see in this\r\nlittle piece of one of the branches magnified.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSometimes it is in large roundish masses, called brain stones, from its\r\nresemblance to the brain of an animal; the openings are then long holes\r\nplaced in two rows between high ridges, like this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd a third form is found consisting of thin pieces, thinner than\r\nwriting paper, placed on edge, spreading out from a centre, or from a\r\nline down the middle of a long strip, and the openings are then plain\r\ndeep furrows, running from the middle to the outside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere is also the precious red Coral of which beads and other trinkets\r\nare made, found principally in the Mediterranean Sea, and several other\r\nsorts, more or less rare. But what I have described to you are the\r\ncommonest.\r\n\r\nThis curious substance extends over hundreds of miles in various parts\r\nof the Tropical Seas, in islands of different forms. But before I\r\ndescribe these to you, I must tell you what is known respecting the\r\nlittle animals by which it is manufactured, for it is proved to be the\r\nwork of certain kinds of the little creatures called Polypes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CORAL-MAKING POLYPES.\r\n\r\nThe Polypes are a kind of animals apparently of very simple structure,\r\nwithout bones, or shells, or heads, or brains. They have very large\r\nmouths surrounded by a great number of _tentacula_, or feelers, which\r\nare threads of flesh possessing the sense of touch in great perfection;\r\nand to these _tentacula_ they owe the name _Polypes_, which comes from\r\ntwo Greek words signifying _many feet_. The ancient naturalists who\r\nnamed them, I suppose did not know but that they were feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIV.\r\n\r\nACTINIÆ CORAL BUILDERS]\r\n\r\nIf this was the case, they were not, however, quite right. Most kinds\r\nof Polypes very seldom move from one place to another in any way,\r\nbut stick themselves upon a rock by means of the flat part of their\r\nbodies, and there remain; and when they let go they generally suffer\r\nthemselves to be washed by the waves to some other place, where they\r\ncan conveniently fix again. If you have ever been at Brighton, or\r\nat any other places by the sea side, for any length of time, I dare\r\nsay you have seen the _sea anemones_, or _sea flowers_, as they are\r\ncalled, carried round by the fish people to show to their customers;\r\nor possibly you may have seen them in the holes on the rocks. They are\r\nproper Polypes, and the scientific name of them is _Actiniæ_. As they\r\nlead their lazy lives as if they were rooted in the rock, when they are\r\nhungry they spread out their tentacula to catch any little insects or\r\nminute fish, such as crabs and shrimps, which may come in their way.\r\nThe instant they feel anything, they close in all their tentacula with\r\nsurprising force. It is worth while to put one's finger just in the\r\ncentre of one of these \"flowers,\" to feel how strongly they can draw\r\nanything in. I have seen one suck in a little crab half as large as its\r\nown body, in this manner.\r\n\r\nWhen closed up they look an insensible lump of pulpy flesh, but when\r\ntheir fringe of tentacula is expanded, they are very beautiful indeed,\r\nand exhibit various rich colours. You may see them in each state in the\r\nplate (fig. 1.), where one is represented closed up, and two are open.\r\n\r\nIf one of these curious creatures is cut into several pieces in certain\r\ndirections, each piece will become an animal. You will say that this\r\nseems more like a plant which is propagated by cuttings, than a proper\r\nanimal. But for all this, and although it only appears to possess\r\nthe same sort of sensibility, in regard to light and touch, as some\r\nplants do, I can give you a very good reason for its being considered\r\nas an animal,--it can move itself according to its own _will_, and\r\nin choosing the time in which it moves, it exhibits instinctive\r\nintelligence. When it finds its little inch of rock in any respect\r\ninconvenient from its being too high above low water mark, or not\r\nsufficiently in the way of the little creatures on which it wants to\r\nsatisfy its appetite, it sucks in a great quantity of water, and swells\r\nitself out so as to become nearly as light as the water, and then\r\nlooses its hold and continues to float about till it comes in contact\r\nwith some more convenient home. When I first saw them thus full of\r\nwater, and carried about by the waves, I thought they were dead.\r\n\r\nNow the coral builders are all of the same general character as the\r\nActiniæ, in the construction of their bodies, their various colours,\r\ngreat mouths surrounded by feelers, and habits of taking their meals.\r\nBut besides their being such wonderful architects, they differ from the\r\nEnglish creature in being very sociable, and living together in immense\r\ncompanies. When you read of the Pyramids of Egypt, or of any other\r\ngreat structures, you may justly think them wonderful proofs of what\r\nthe labours of many men may do when directed to a single object; but\r\nhere you have not houses, pyramids, cities, nor even mere islands, but\r\nwhole continents constructed by the combined labours of little insects.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell you, neither can any one else, in what manner these\r\nlittle workmen perform their work. It is only certain that they have\r\nsome faculty by which they appropriate the particles of carbonate of\r\nlime contained in the sea water, and dispose them in the various forms\r\nI have mentioned to you. When the coral is in progress, it is coated\r\nwith a soft gluey sort of substance, and over the star-like clusters\r\nof openings, there may be seen, when the creatures are hungry, little\r\nrosettes of tentacula, more beautiful than you can conceive.\r\n\r\nIn fig. 2 of the plate, you may see some of these animals showing their\r\nrich rosettes on a piece of branch coral, such as is represented in the\r\nfirst wood cut, page 204.\r\n\r\nThere is another sort of branch coral, where the animal always lives at\r\nthe end of the branch, the whole of which it has to itself, and will\r\nthen spread out its tentacula in a star on the extremity, as you may\r\nsee in figs. 3 and 4.\r\n\r\nIn fig. 5, you may see one of the animals which construct the sort of\r\ncoral represented in the cut, page 205.\r\n\r\nSince these little creatures can lay down their tentacula in the\r\nopenings of their stony houses, when they are not hungry, or when they\r\nare alarmed by the approach of anything that would hurt them, they do\r\nnot want the tough skin with which the Actinia is covered, but have\r\nbodies of a very soft and yielding texture.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMS OF THE CORAL REEFS.\r\n\r\nAs I have now introduced to you, as well as I can by means of\r\ndescription and pictures, the inhabitants of these wonderful submarine\r\ncontinents, I shall now tell you something of the form in which they\r\narrange their habitations. Those that I saw about the Society and\r\nFriendly Islands, were mostly in three different conditions. One kind\r\nforms a nearly circular reef, sometimes with an opening in it. It is a\r\npart of the common design of the Polypes always to make this opening\r\non the Leeward side, when the place is one in which any particular\r\nwind blows during a great part of the year. I cannot tell you why\r\nthis is, but it is constantly observed wherever coral reefs are found.\r\nThis peculiarity makes the enclosed spaces of water, (which are called\r\nLagoons,) capital harbours for ships to anchor in, for they are nearly\r\nalways smooth, the windward side of the reef acting as a breakwater.\r\nHere is a map of three reefs of this form, in a part of the ocean where\r\nthe prevailing wind is South East, and you will see all the openings\r\nare towards the North West.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnother sort have an island of which the foundation is coral, in the\r\nmiddle of a ring like the above; and a third sort are merely the same\r\nkind of rings round large islands, composed of other sorts of rocks and\r\nearth. A very great number of the islands hereabouts,--perhaps most of\r\nthem, are surrounded in this manner.\r\n\r\nI well remember the first impressions which the sight of a coral\r\nreef made upon me. I always like to treasure up in my mind the first\r\nimpression produced by a beautiful scene; for however wonderful the\r\nobjects may be, when you have seen them many times, you become in some\r\ndegree indifferent to them. This first impression that I am going to\r\ndescribe to you, is a continual feast to me when I think upon it, and I\r\nwish you could enjoy it with me.\r\n\r\nThe first parts of the reef we saw were black, roundish masses,\r\nstanding up out of the water, having just the appearance of black men's\r\nheads, and when I asked the sailors what they were, they told me they\r\nwere \"negroes' heads.\" I was curious, as you may suppose, to know what\r\nthey could be, and I afterwards found they were masses of coral, which\r\nwere not covered by the sea, except at very high tides, and had become\r\nblackened by the weather.\r\n\r\nThe sun was shining brightly, and there was a smart breeze. The waves\r\nbreaking over the ragged surface of the coral threw up abundance of\r\nspray, which the sun's rays, every now and then, painted with the most\r\nbeautiful rainbow colours. We sailed through an opening, and when we\r\nhad got into the Lagoon, the sea was perfectly smooth. The water was as\r\nclear as crystal, and we saw the bottom, and what was going on there,\r\nnearly as well as if we had been close to it, though the depth was very\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNo flower garden was ever more exquisitely varied, both as to form and\r\ncolour, than the scene under the water. The coral itself, standing\r\nup in the forms of shrubs, wheat-sheaves, mushrooms, stags'-horns,\r\ncabbages, and cauliflowers, was mostly covered with millions of the\r\nlittle polypes, displaying their graceful rosettes of green, purple,\r\nyellow, brown and white. Among these were strewn innumerable shells\r\nfrom the smallest to the largest, and amongst the most conspicuous\r\nwere the gigantic clams, of which many specimens weigh hundreds of\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nThen there were seen fish darting in and out as they\r\n\r\n                                \"With quick glance,\r\n    Showed to the Sun their waved coats dropt with gold,\"\r\n\r\nthe variegated Zebra fish, and a hundred other species, often popping\r\nup from deep holes and caves, of which we could not see the bottom. All\r\nseemed life, beauty, and enjoyment, and when I had looked at it a long\r\ntime, it brought to my mind the time when God looked upon what he had\r\nformed, and said that it was good, for you could not wish anything to\r\nbe different from what it was; the scene appeared faultless, and quite\r\nfilled up the heart with emotions of love and beauty.\r\n\r\nThis reef was one of those which surrounded a good-sized island. The\r\ncut will show you nearly how it appeared to be situated in regard to\r\nthe land; _a_ is the land; _b_ the coral; and _c_ the Lagoon, the\r\nwidth of which was about a quarter of a mile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere were in it several masses of coral of a very curious shape, such\r\nas I have since found always exist in Lagoons. They are first built up\r\nin the form of a sugar-loaf, and when they get up somewhere between\r\nhigh and low-water-mark, the polypes extend them at the sides so as\r\nto make a sort of mushroom top, closely resembling the stones which\r\nfarmers place ricks upon, to keep them out of the way of rats and mice.\r\nTheir constructing these rocks in the sugar-loaf form, so as to make\r\nthem as firm as possible, is a proof that the labours of the polypes\r\nare directed by a common instinct, and that each one does not do as he\r\nlikes, without regard to the rest. I suppose the reason why they spread\r\nthem out at top, is because they love best the highest habitations they\r\ncan get, that are not quite out of the water; and therefore as many\r\npolypes as can, make their residences there.\r\n\r\nAs the tide went down, a considerable space of the shore of the reef\r\nwas left dry, towards the Lagoon, where it slanted off gently. Upon\r\nthis there were some of the large clam shells, such as you saw a\r\ncut of just now. They generally lay about half open, but they would\r\noccasionally shut their shells together with a loud report, and then\r\nspout up a stream of water three or four feet high. We boiled one of\r\nthese fish and tasted it, but found it very disagreeable. The fish\r\nweighed about four pounds, and the shell about fifty. There were many\r\nof a much larger size.\r\n\r\nThe reefs towards the sea outside the Lagoons go down very suddenly,\r\nand the soundings are generally deep, close alongside them. This is\r\nascribed to their being built upon the tops of submarine hills and\r\nmountains, for it is believed that the polypes cannot work at very\r\ngreat depths.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the reef is seldom quite so high as high-water-mark; but\r\nthey sometimes go along an incredible distance without interruption,\r\nvery near that point. The inhabitants of the group of islands called\r\nDisappointment Islands, and also of those called Duff's Islands, pay\r\nvisits to each other over a bridge of coral 600 miles in length, on a\r\ngreat part of which their feet are close to the water, so that they\r\nlook when on their journey at the time of high-water, just like troops\r\nmarching on the surface of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe natives of some of the Polynesian islands have actually employed\r\nsome of these wonderful little masons to build quays and piers. The\r\nway they do this, is to break off large masses of coral from any reef\r\nthat may be near, and drop them down where they want to form the pier.\r\nIn a short time the polypes will have stuck them together as firmly\r\nas possible. In an island called Barabora, a very fine quay has been\r\nthus constructed, where a good-sized vessel may conveniently take in or\r\ndischarge its cargo.\r\n\r\nThere were once coral islands where England is now, for in many\r\ncounties fossil coral is found in great quantities. It is indeed most\r\nlikely that there are large tracts in every part of the world, which\r\nowe their existence to the labours of polypes.\r\n\r\nThis would most probably be the history of the formation of one of\r\nthese tracts, if it were in the Pacific Ocean. A volcanic eruption\r\nwould throw up a mountain from the bottom of the sea, the top of which\r\nmight be 60 or 70 feet below the surface. As soon as the eruption had\r\nceased, some polypes who may have left their position on a neighbouring\r\nreef, might be brought by the tide into contact with the summit, and\r\nwould immediately begin to work. The race of polypes would multiply,\r\nand the building would go on year after year, till the reef reached the\r\nsurface. Pieces of wood which are always drifting about in the ocean,\r\nmight be washed into the Lagoon and rest upon the shore. A little soil\r\nmight thus be formed in the course of years, and a cocoa-nut or some\r\nother sort of seed, which would equally well bear soaking in the salt\r\nwater, might be brought from some distant land, and may take root and\r\nproduce a tree. The steady trade winds would also bring some of those\r\nseeds which are provided with wings, such as thistles. Various sea\r\nbirds might build their nests upon the infant land, which would thus be\r\nincreased in a hundred different ways. Small animals driven out to sea\r\non pieces of timber or trees, torn away from their original position\r\nby hurricanes, might land upon it; and after a succession of ages, man\r\nwould take possession, and a populous country in time be formed.\r\n\r\nIf you are fond of poetry, you would be much pleased with a very\r\nbeautiful description of such a process as this, in James Montgomery's\r\npoem, called the Pelican Island, which you should read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LUMINOUS APPEARANCE OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you were to go on a long voyage, there is nothing that you would be\r\nmuch more pleased with, than the occasional bright appearance of the\r\nsea at night. You might see this in all latitudes, but more frequently\r\nin the tropical, than in colder climates. It occurs in a variety\r\nof modes, and, as it seems, arises from several different causes.\r\nSometimes the wake of the vessel looks like a waving line of beautiful\r\nsilver light; sometimes the surface will be studded with spots of\r\nbright light, about as large as your heads; not unfrequently you may\r\nsee large islands of light; and now and then a shoal of Albicores,\r\nor some other fish, will pass the vessel, shaking sparks of dazzling\r\nbrightness from their fins in all directions.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed by some that the brightness in the track of a\r\nvessel, and that which sparkles and flashes in the spray on the tops of\r\nthe waves, is electrical light: whether it is so or not, I cannot tell\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nThe effect is, no doubt, sometimes produced by decayed animal and\r\nvegetable bodies, which appear bright in the dark. I dare say you have\r\nseen the bodies of dead fish, and the surface of rotten wood have\r\nthis appearance. The particles in which the brightness exists are so\r\nsmall, that you cannot see them, for, if you touch the luminous body,\r\nparticularly if it is a stinking fish, your fingers will immediately\r\nappear bright in the dark, and when you look at them in the light, you\r\nwill not be able to see anything on the surface of the skin.\r\n\r\nBut the most wonderful and extensive cause of all, is the existence\r\nof countless myriads of fish and insects, which are supplied with a\r\nfluid substance that oozes out of their bodies, and shines with a\r\ngreenish light upon their surface. Some of them may easily be taken,\r\nby dropping over a net where the luminous spots appear. A few of them\r\nare small shell-fish, of the crab or lobster kind. However, the greater\r\npart are an immense family of creatures called _Acalephæ_, or _sea\r\nnettles_. The word _Acalepha_ is the Greek for a sting nettle, and they\r\nare so called for a reason which I will tell you presently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere are a great many different forms of them, but they mostly agree\r\nin having their bodies shaped something like an umbrella, with long\r\nfilaments hanging down from them. This is a picture of one of the\r\nkind called Berenice. It takes its name from the resemblance of its\r\nfilaments, to the long hair of a lady. Berenice was the wife of a\r\nwarrior, who made a vow to sacrifice the hair of her head, which was\r\nsingularly beautiful, to Venus, if her husband returned from some\r\nsuccessful exploit in which he was engaged. He did so, and the lady\r\naccordingly hung up her hair in the temple of Venus, and thereby gained\r\nthe honor of giving her name to a constellation called the hair of\r\nBerenice, and the curious animal figured in the cut.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the body is a mere mass of jelly, mostly quite\r\ntransparent, but sometimes tinged with blue or green; and when deprived\r\nof life it becomes merely a salt liquid, and an extremely thin skin,\r\nweighing only a few grains.\r\n\r\nThe mouth is underneath, in amongst the filaments, which seem to be\r\nplaced where they are for the purpose of entangling small fish and\r\ninsects, to hold them till the Acalepha can swallow them. A very great\r\nnumber of them are of a kind called Medusa, from the resemblance of\r\ntheir filaments to the snakes, which were said to take the place of\r\nhair upon the head of Medusa, one of the Furies. One or two sorts have\r\na crest which they erect as a sail, and thus move along before the\r\nwind, on the surface of the sea, in calm weather. I will show you the\r\npicture of one of these called the Physalia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe size varies from that of a pin's head, to a foot or more in\r\ndiameter, and it is said that some have been found to weigh as much as\r\n50 pounds. Their weight is a very little more in proportion to their\r\nbulk than that of salt water, and they keep themselves afloat on the\r\nsurface, as long as they are inclined, by moving very slowly along,\r\nwhich they do by alternately contracting and expanding a very light\r\nring of muscle, which surrounds the umbrella. When they are tired of\r\ntheir snail's gallop, or they want to descend on any other account,\r\nthey cease moving, and down they go. In this respect they are just\r\nlike a man swimming, who sinks if he ceases to strike with his limbs.\r\n\r\nThere are some species peculiar to hot climates, where they are\r\ngenerally larger, and more luminous; and some to cold. But what is\r\nwanting in size is amply made up in number, in the Arctic regions. A\r\ncertain naturalist calculated by a fair average, how many Acalephæ\r\nthere were in two square miles of sea, and the result of his\r\ncalculation would fill up a whole line of this work with figures; you\r\nmay judge something of it, by his saying that to count the number would\r\nhave taken 80,000 persons all the time that has elapsed since the\r\ncreation of the world, counting as fast as they could! It is on these\r\ncreatures, most of them so small that they cannot be seen without a\r\nmicroscope, that the vast bodies of the whales are supported, caught in\r\nthe wonderful shrimp-trap, which I described to you in a former page!\r\n\r\nTwo or three kinds are found on your own shores, and I should not\r\nwonder if some of you may not before now have found them lying on\r\nthe sea-shore, which the tide has left dry, and taken them up in\r\nyour hands. If so, I am sure you will not forget it, nor be in any\r\ndifficulty to know why they are called _sea nettles_. They have a\r\nstinging power, which will make the hand smart that touches them.\r\nThis is owing to a caustic fluid with which a part of their bodies is\r\nconstantly covered.\r\n\r\nIt is this caustic fluid which is luminous. It oozes through the skin\r\nall round the muscular ring by which they move, and at the large\r\nfilaments. The whole body of the creature looks bright, but it is only\r\nfrom the light transmitted by these parts. You may get a very fair\r\nnotion of the appearance of one of their bodies, by rubbing together\r\ntwo partly transparent pebbles in the dark; the light is of nearly\r\nthe same colour, and though it is only produced just at the points of\r\ncontact of the pebbles, it illuminates their whole substance.\r\n\r\nAs they move along they are much brighter when they contract their\r\nbodies, than when they expand them; this is because in contracting they\r\npress out the luminous fluid. I will tell you of some experiments and\r\nobservations, which have been made on them.\r\n\r\nThe body of an Acalepha was squeezed over a glass of warm fresh water,\r\nand the fluid that dropped out communicated its luminous property to\r\nthe water. The same was then done with a glass of warm salt water, but\r\nthe effect was not nearly so great.\r\n\r\nOne was squeezed over a vessel containing nearly a quart of milk, which\r\nit made so resplendent that one could see to read by it. The milk\r\nretained its brightness for several hours, and when it faded, it could\r\nbe restored by stirring: even three days afterwards it was made bright\r\nby being warmed.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the Acalephæ communicate a slight degree of light to the\r\nsea-water, in which they swim; but, if they are put into fresh water,\r\nthe light spreads much further.\r\n\r\nI have often seen them round the ship, looking like so many moons,\r\nand emitting light enough for me to read by, some on the surface, and\r\nothers at various depths below it. Their appearance was exquisitely\r\nbeautiful when the weather was still and the night dark; but as I\r\nthought about it, I could not help having something of a melancholy\r\nfeeling at the strange kind of half-life these creatures lead. They\r\nmight enjoy themselves, but I could not tell how, for they had no sight\r\nnor hearing; they loved no light except their own selfish light; they\r\nmoved about in the open sea, without seeming to enjoy their freedom,\r\nfor they did not care which way they moved; they had no fixed homes or\r\nneighbourhoods to love, like the coral insects; and above all, they did\r\nnot care for their kind, for they appear to come near each other only\r\nby chance as the wind or the waves may drive them.\r\n\r\nBut as they were created by God, their life was given them for some\r\nwise end, and no doubt they have something to do in creation, and they\r\nare capable of enjoyment, though perhaps of nothing that would be\r\nenjoyment to us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV.\r\n\r\nSEPIAS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE CUTTLE FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever seen the bone of a cuttle fish? It is a flat, white, very\r\nlight thing, about the shape and size of a small sole, or flat fish,\r\nwhich may be often picked up on the sea-shore. One side is covered\r\nwith a very hard substance, which stands out and forms a border all\r\nround; but the other side, which has no covering, is so soft that you\r\ncan easily scrape it into powder with your nail. It is often used for\r\nmaking tooth-powder, and polishing certain things, such as hard woods\r\nand tortoise-shell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis comes from some of a most curious family of fishes, called by the\r\ngeneral name of _Cephalopods_, from the Greek words for head and feet,\r\nbecause their feet are placed round their heads, and they walk along\r\nwith their heads downwards.\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds represented in the plate, which will give you\r\na general notion of their form and appearance. In the structure of\r\ntheir bodies they possess much more in common with the kind of animals\r\nwith which you are familiar, than the Actiniæ which make the coral,\r\nor the Acalephæ which produce the luminous appearance on the sea;\r\nthough nothing can be more strange or unsightly than their aspect. They\r\nhave a complete system of circulation, though their blood is neither\r\nwarm nor red as ours is; their brains are enclosed in a strong case\r\nor skull of gristle, and their organs of sense are well developed;\r\nthey have large and perfect eyes, (as you may see in the picture,)\r\nstanding out prominently, and ears on each side of the brain. Their\r\nmouths are armed with very strong horny lips not unlike the bill of a\r\nparrot, between which is a very rough tongue. They have no noses, but\r\nit has been proved by experiment that they like some smells and dislike\r\nothers, and it has been supposed that the quality of substances which\r\naffects merely the organ of smell in us, affects in like manner the\r\nwhole surface of their bodies, or at least, of their heads. They not\r\nonly resemble birds in their mouths, but also in having gizzards.\r\n\r\nTheir great arms or legs, for they serve both purposes equally well,\r\nof which they generally have eight, are very wonderful. They have\r\nno bones in them to act as levers, but are merely long and muscular\r\nmasses of flesh which they move about with wonderful activity and power\r\nin all directions, having the most complete command over them. On\r\ntheir surfaces are great numbers of little suckers or cups resembling\r\nleather, which adhere very strongly to anybody which the animal chooses\r\nto embrace.\r\n\r\nYou have, no doubt, often played with a round piece of thick leather\r\nwith a string through it, by wetting it and pressing it with your foot\r\nupon a stone, so as to lift the stone up, if it be not too heavy. It is\r\njust on the same principle that the suckers of the Cuttle Fish act.\r\n\r\nThese curious creatures gather up some of their arms into a point, as\r\na sort of cut-water, as sailors would call it, and swim very rapidly,\r\nby means of the others, having their heads behind. They crawl in all\r\ndirections with equal facility.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTheir skin changes colour in spots like that of the Chameleon. But\r\nI shall now tell you their most remarkable peculiarities. They are\r\nprovided with a bag filled with black stuff, very like printer's ink.\r\nThis bag they can at pleasure open, and press out some of the ink; so\r\nwhen any voracious fish approaches, which the Cuttle Fish thinks will\r\nbe too strong for him, he squeezes his ink-bag and colours the water\r\nround him, and thus all of a sudden becomes enveloped in a dark cloud,\r\nin which his enemy gropes about in vain, while he makes the best of his\r\nway off. Is not this a most astonishing mode of defence?\r\n\r\nThe kind which is found most frequently in our country is represented\r\nin the plate fig. 2. Its skin is smooth and often of a dusky white,\r\nwith reddish brown spots, and its length about a foot. It is eaten by\r\nthe poor people on the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea. I never tasted\r\nit, but I do not think that either you or I should like it, from the\r\nlook of its flesh.\r\n\r\nThere is another species of which the ink makes the colour called\r\nsepia, which is of great value to artists.\r\n\r\nThe largest is called Octopus, and is figured No. 1, in the plate. It\r\nis a very powerful creature, and very ferocious in its disposition.\r\nIt is mostly found in the Indian Ocean, where it has been known to\r\ndrown men by throwing its great arms round their limbs as they were\r\nswimming. It is also much dreaded by the natives of some of the\r\nislands, who sail in small canoes; for an Octopus will sometimes\r\ncast one of its arms over the side of the canoe, and will be sure to\r\noverturn it, if the man does not instantly chop the arm off.\r\n\r\nLike most other very wonderful things, the accounts of the Octopus\r\nseem to have been strangely exaggerated, though we should not be too\r\nready to deny what a man who seems to be sensible and honest relates,\r\nmerely because it is not like our own experience. In regard to the\r\nlargest size to which the creature has been known to attain, it is very\r\ndifficult to tell what is the truth. I will relate to you what has been\r\nsaid on the subject.\r\n\r\nSome navigators have asserted that the largest vessels have been put in\r\ndanger by an Octopus raising its arms so as to get them entangled in\r\nthe rigging; and a great many have said the same respecting large boats.\r\n\r\nPliny, the Roman Naturalist, tells a story of one in particular, which\r\nwas a sad thief. I should tell you that the Octopus is able to walk on\r\nland when the surface is uneven, so that he can get something for his\r\nsuckers to adhere to. Well, this individual that Pliny mentions, used\r\nto visit a house near the sea-side, and steal all the provisions within\r\nhis reach. He was seen once or twice before he could be taken; but at\r\nlast his thefts were so important, that the inhabitants of the house\r\nwatched for him all night, and caught him by the help of dogs, as he\r\nwas striding over the rocks towards the sea. It is said that he weighed\r\n700 pounds, and that his arms were 30 feet in length, and so stout that\r\na man could not embrace them.\r\n\r\nStill more wonderful are the narrations which were commonly believed\r\nabout 150 years ago, respecting some Sepias that frequented the coast\r\nof Norway. They were then generally called Krakens, and were supposed\r\nto be at times nearly a quarter of a mile in length. It is related that\r\nsailors not unfrequently mistook them for islands.\r\n\r\nThis is alluded to by Milton in a passage of the Paradise Lost,--\r\n\r\n    Him haply slumbering on the Norway foam\r\n    The pilot of some small night-foundered skiff,\r\n    Deeming some island, oft, as seamen tell,\r\n    With fixed anchor on his scaly rind,\r\n    Moors by his side under the lee, and waits\r\n    The wished approach of morn.\r\n\r\nI dare say you will be ready to think that these things are very\r\nunlikely, and I shall not much differ from you if you do. But no doubt\r\nsome of these creatures must be very large, and much to be dreaded, or\r\nsuch things would never have been said of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVI.\r\n\r\nPAPER NAUTILUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE NAUTILUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there is one of these Sepias, or Cuttle Fish, which I like very\r\nmuch, though its character rests under as severe an imputation for\r\ndishonesty and rapacity, as that of the rest. It is that one which\r\ninhabits the beautiful white semi-transparent shell, and is called the\r\nPaper Nautilus, or Argonaut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIts body is represented out of the shell in the plate, fig. 3, and you\r\nwill there see that it is not very different from those that are not\r\nprovided with shells, except in having two of its eight arms spread out\r\nat the ends into a thin membrane or web. You shall hear presently the\r\npretty use which it makes of these webs.\r\n\r\nIt has no muscular attachment to the shell, as most other shell-fish\r\nhave, but merely adheres to it by means of its suckers. On this\r\naccount, some have thought that the Sepia must be an usurper, who has\r\nmurdered the original master of the shell, and taken possession of his\r\nhouse. But I do not believe there is any truth in this charge, for the\r\nsame sort of animal is always found in the same shell, and if it be\r\ntaken out, though it may be kept in salt water, it is sure to die.\r\n\r\nWhen at the bottom of the sea, he walks about with his shell uppermost,\r\nlike a snail, but of course with a much more rapid motion, and every\r\nnow and then snatches any mouthful that may take his fancy, with two of\r\nhis long arms, and conveys it to his horny beak.\r\n\r\nWhen the weather is fine, and he is disposed to enjoy it, he partly\r\nempties his shell of water, so as to make himself lighter than the\r\nsurrounding sea, and comes up to the surface, on which he floats like a\r\nlittle ship.\r\n\r\nI once had an excellent opportunity of watching one. The sea was\r\nbeautifully calm, and blue, and the sky perfectly clear, when I caught\r\nsight of something white coming upwards at a little distance from the\r\nship. In an instant the delicate white shell popped above the surface,\r\ntwirled round, and the Sepia spouted out the water remaining in his\r\nshell, spread out his two sails, and threw out his six remaining\r\nfeet, three on each side of the edge of his shell, which acted as\r\noars, and scudded away before the wind. If you had but seen the glad\r\nlittle creature, it would have done your heart good. He seemed full of\r\nfreedom, and life, and joy. The dark deep caves of ocean, with their\r\ncorals and sea-weeds, and strange variety of inhabitants; the broad\r\nsurface of the sea, the fresh breeze, the lovely blue sky, and the\r\nglorious light of the sun, were all at his command.\r\n\r\n   \"Thou the light sail boldly spreadest,\r\n    O'er the furrowed waters gliding,\r\n    Thou nor wreck nor foeman dreadest,\r\n    Thou nor help nor comfort needest,\r\n    While the sun is bright above thee,\r\n    While the bounding surges love thee,\r\n    In their deepening bosoms hiding,\r\n              Thou canst not fear\r\n              Small marinere;\r\n    For though the tides with restless motion\r\n    Bear thee to the desert ocean,\r\n    Far as the ocean stretches to the sea,\r\n    'Tis all thy own, 'tis all thy empery.\r\n\r\n   \"Lame is Art, and her endeavour\r\n    Follows Nature's course but slowly,\r\n    Guessing, toiling, seeking, ever,\r\n    Still improving, perfect never.\r\n    Little Nautilus, thou showest\r\n    Deeper wisdom than thou knowest;\r\n    Lore, which man should study slowly;\r\n              Bold faith and cheer,\r\n              Small marinere.\r\n    Are thine within thy pearly dwelling;\r\n    Thine, a law of life compelling\r\n    Obedience, perfect, simple, glad and free,\r\n    To the Great Will that animates the sea.\"\r\n\r\n  (_Hartley Coleridge._)\r\n\r\nYou should read these exquisite lines with deep attention. There is an\r\nallusion in the second verse to the common notion that the form of a\r\nship was first taken from the Nautilus; and, indeed, there is a very\r\ndistinct resemblance in a part of the shell to the keel, and in another\r\npart to the poop. The sails and oars you will see best in the picture.\r\n\r\nDo you think that if the Sepia were a murderer and a thief, in\r\npossession of what does not belong to him, according to the notion of\r\nsome naturalists which I was telling you of just now, that he could be\r\nso happy,--so in every way at home,--in his silver boat? If you had\r\nseen him as I did, I am sure you would agree with me in saying that he\r\ncould not be any other than the rightful owner.\r\n\r\nAfter \"the small marinere\" had sailed some distance, he folded up his\r\nsails and packed them and his oars close into his shell, and went down\r\nlike a stone.\r\n\r\nThe Paper Nautilus is mostly found in hot climates. It is never seen\r\non the surface unless at a long distance from land, and it is very\r\nshy of danger, so that it is not often you can get such a good chance\r\nof observing one as I had. I have been told by a person who was to be\r\ntrusted, that sometimes the Sepia will lay hold of a piece of drift\r\nwood, a large leaf, or any other floating substance, and use it as a\r\nraft, when it is not inclined to take the trouble of balancing its\r\nshell with its feet, and spreading its sails.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my little friends, what I have told you respecting these\r\nmarvellous Sepias, reminds me of something on which I may give you a\r\nuseful caution. Many people are very fond of congratulating you on\r\nthe great wisdom and knowledge of the times in which you live, and\r\nof making very light of what the ancients knew, or thought they knew,\r\nespecially respecting natural history. In doing this they are not\r\njust to those who lived before us, and very often deceive themselves\r\nin regard to the present state of our knowledge. Aristotle, the tutor\r\nof Alexander the Great, did more in investigating the nature of the\r\nNautilus, and all other kinds of Cuttle fish, than any other naturalist\r\nhas done, and in his writings, (if you could read them,) you might find\r\nnearly all the particulars I have mentioned, and a great many besides.\r\nAs to some foolish things that may be found related by him and other\r\nold writers, which are held up for your ridicule, it is not at all\r\nunlikely that future ages may find flaws and follies in what writings\r\nwe may leave behind us, as we now do in what our predecessors have left\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEARLY NAUTILUS, &C.\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of Nautilus, the shell of which is very strong,\r\nand marked with brown streaks. You will see it in plate XV, fig.\r\n4. It also differs from the Paper Nautilus, in being divided into a\r\nsuccession of cells or chambers, in this manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn this respect it is like the immense family of extinct shells called\r\nAmmonites, or Cornua Ammonis; but the partitions of the chambers of the\r\nlatter are undulated, thus\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs the cells are mostly filled with various hard earthy substances,\r\nso as to form one solid mass, they used to be called snake-stones,\r\nbecause it was fancied they were petrified snakes. There are a great\r\nnumber of them on the coast of Yorkshire, and the story was once\r\nbelieved that the place had been infested with an immense quantity of\r\nsnakes which were changed into stone at the prayer of St. Hilda. What I\r\nam going to tell you, relates both to the Ammonites and the Nautilus.\r\n\r\nIf you examine the first cut, you will see small openings connecting\r\nall the cells with each other, and the continuous passage thus formed\r\nthrough the whole of the shell, is called the siphuncle. The inhabitant\r\nof the shell is an animal of the Sepia kind, but without the webs which\r\nserve the Paper Nautilus for sails, and with its arms not so long. It\r\nalways resides in the outermost chamber, and it is supposed that it\r\nforms a new partition every year, so that the age of the animal may be\r\nknown by counting the number of chambers.\r\n\r\nWhen the Pearly Nautilus wishes to rise to the surface, it pumps out\r\nthe water from its shell through the siphuncle, and makes itself light.\r\nIt floats often with its shell upwards, and at other times it moves\r\nalong backwards for a considerable distance, by means of spouting out\r\nwater over the front edge of the shell. It never floats with the same\r\nbeautiful stateliness as the Argonaut.\r\n\r\nThere is also the pretty little shell of the Nautilus Spirula, not much\r\nlarger than a shilling, plate XVI, fig. 5, which does not contain a\r\nfish, but is merely annexed to the body of a Sepia, as is represented,\r\nfig. 6. Its use appears to be just the same as that of the shell of the\r\nPearly Nautilus, to answer the purpose of a float.\r\n\r\nThese two kinds are very rarely seen floating on the surface, though\r\nthere must be many of both of them in the ocean, from the number of\r\ntheir empty shells which are found. Perhaps this arises from their not\r\nbeing so buoyant as the Argonauts, and hence they more readily dip\r\nunder the surface at the approach of a vessel.\r\n\r\nIt is now time for us to bid adieu to the sea and its wonderful\r\ninhabitants, since I have promised to tell you of some of the wonders\r\nof the sky, (though I remember a great many more things that I should\r\nlike to tell you of).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PART III.\r\n\r\n                          WONDERS OF THE SKY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nCOLOUR OF THE SKY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I tell you of some of the wonders of the sky, I should like to\r\ntell you what the sky is: it is true you know pretty nearly as much as\r\nI do about it, but you perhaps have not thought so much on what you\r\nknow. The sky is everything above our heads which is not connected with\r\nthe earth: thus, you may speak of a cloudy sky, or a clear sky; or of\r\nthe stars, sun, and moon, being in the sky.\r\n\r\nIt may however be more proper to restrict the word to the blue\r\nappearance which the atmosphere above us assumes when it is not\r\nconcealed by clouds. This appearance is caused by looking into the\r\nair, which surrounds the globe to the height of forty or fifty miles\r\nabove its surface, and not by anything which exists above it; for\r\nmountains, when seen from a great distance, appear of the same colour,\r\nevidently from the extent of the air between the spectator and them.\r\n\r\nClimate and the season of the year, have a considerable influence on\r\nthe colour of the sky. You know what a rich full blue is over us in the\r\nhot months of summer; and I hope you have before now enjoyed the pale\r\nblue of a clear winter's day, when the brown and bare branches of the\r\ntrees have showed against it, and all the rivers and ponds have been\r\nfrozen as solid as a stone pavement. When I see some of you sliding and\r\nskating on the glassy ice, at such times I am ready to wish I was a boy\r\nagain, to join in your pleasures. However, I have had my turn, and old\r\nage has its pleasures as well as youth, only we are apt to get into a\r\nway of looking at all past times as happier than the present, which\r\nis both foolish and wicked. If we were to keep ourselves diligently\r\nengaged in doing our duty, we should always be happy, whether old or\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nBut the darkest blue sky you have ever seen in your country, is light\r\ncompared with the skies of hot climates. In them you often see a deep\r\nrich indigo; at other times you are under a canopy of reddish orange,\r\nalmost copper colour, like that which was called in the poem I quoted\r\nto you when describing the tropical sea, \"a hot and copper sky.\"\r\n\r\nThe elevation of the observer above the surface of the earth, is\r\nlikewise another cause of variation. I have never myself ascended a\r\nmountain sufficiently high to see this, but I have been told by a\r\ngentleman who had been at the top of Mont Blanc, that the sky there\r\nlooked nearly black.\r\n\r\nAs you must have seen them yourselves, I need only remind you of the\r\nglorious changes of colour by the alteration of the light at the\r\ndifferent times of day. I hope none of you are so lazy as not often\r\nto have enjoyed the rosy mornings; then there is the grey twilight of\r\nevening, and the splendours of the setting sun in the west, round which\r\nthe deep orange shades off into the most delicate yellow, which again\r\nglides imperceptibly into pale blue towards the east. Then the moon,\r\nwhen she has the heavens all to herself, and the stars, when they are\r\nshining out boldly in her absence, each make the sky so beautiful, and\r\nare so beautiful in themselves, that one cannot exceed the other.\r\n\r\nI love to look at the moon when the winds rend the clouds asunder, and\r\ndrive them tumultuously along, and you see her now and then in the\r\ndark blue depths between. But if I were to tell you all the ordinary\r\nappearances in the sky which I love, I should leave no room to describe\r\nits wonders; which will not do, because I meant this book to give you\r\nan account of things which most of you have not seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE AURORA BOREALIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months in the Polar Regions, the sun never rises\r\nabove the horizon; and during summer it performs in appearance a little\r\ncircle round the pole of the Heavens, and never goes out of sight.\r\nYou may learn in what manner this is occasioned by the position of\r\nthose countries on the surface of the earth, from the book called \"The\r\nWonders of the Telescope.\"\r\n\r\nThe year is thus in reality divided into one long day and one long\r\nnight. While the night continues, the ground is covered with snow, and\r\nno vegetable life is to be seen, and the animals have much to do to\r\nsupport themselves on what fish they may chance to pick up on the sea\r\nshore, by preying on each other, or else by scraping away the snow to\r\nget at that scanty vegetation which exists underneath. The odd-looking\r\nEsquimaux and Greenlanders would indeed be very badly off, if it\r\nwere not for the beautiful atmospheric phenomena which I am going to\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere are seldom intervals of many hours which are not illuminated by\r\nthese beautiful meteors, called Auroræ Boreales, or Northern Lights,\r\noccurring in a never-ending variety of form, colour, and intensity.\r\nThey generally have a tendency to form an irregular arch, and one side\r\nof them is always much better defined than the other. The more ragged\r\nside sends out brilliant corruscations, shooting out into the sharpest\r\nangles.\r\n\r\nSir John Ross describes one which was nearly the colour of the full\r\nmoon, and of equal brightness, in the form of a well-defined arch\r\nextending quite across the heavens, and reminded him of what he\r\nconceived must be the effect of Saturn's ring seen by the inhabitants\r\nof that planet from its surface. It lasted for several hours, and at\r\nlast broke up as it were into fragments of light, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe distinctness of its form is much influenced by the wind, and when\r\nthe air becomes agitated, showers of rays spread out in every direction\r\nwith the quickness of lightning. Sir Edward Parry describes long bands\r\nof light extending with immense rapidity, but always appearing to form\r\nround a fixed point, something like a riband held in the hand and\r\nshaken with an undulatory motion.\r\n\r\nLittle scraps of the brightest light dart about in the heavens, called\r\nby the sailors, \"merry dancers.\" In stormy weather these wild little\r\nthings assume all manner of fanciful shapes; sometimes they shoot like\r\nrockets across the firmament, then take a zigzag or waving direction,\r\nand frequently seem to become invisible, and shine out again a little\r\nfurther on. The Esquimaux say that these appearances are the spirits\r\nof their ancestors playing at ball with the head of a Walrus! You may\r\nperhaps laugh at this odd notion, and I will laugh with you, if you\r\nwill learn a lesson from it. You see that men in various states of\r\nsociety, are always looking out for the appearance of spiritual beings,\r\nand therefore that this disposition is a part of their constitution\r\nwhich is given them by God: and although their fancies may form strange\r\nnotions at times, yet the exercise of the faculty, in some way or\r\nother, is very important. Men had much better think that they see\r\nspirits in the Aurora Borealis, and that they hear them in the wind,\r\nthan forget that there are such things as spirits, and that they have\r\nspirits within them, which will live when their bodies are turned into\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nBut for you, my little friends, who are better instructed, there is no\r\noccasion to think you can see or hear spirits with your bodily ears\r\nand eyes; but I trust you will always _feel_ inwardly that there are\r\nspirits within you and around you, and one Great Spirit above you.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful form of the Aurora, is called the Corona. It is\r\na luminous ring generally just overhead, with long distinct rays\r\nvery slender, but extremely bright, diverging from it all round. It\r\nonly lasts a few seconds, and then seems to burst like a firework,\r\nscattering sparks in all directions.\r\n\r\nThe stars mostly shine through the Aurora, as through a veil of thin\r\ngauze. The darkness of the sky, with the stars shining in it above\r\nand below, produces a most astonishing effect, which you may see very\r\nwell represented in the frontispiece, where there is depicted a small\r\nportion of the middle of a luminous arch, very clearly defined.\r\n\r\nIt was considered, till quite lately, that the Aurora in the Northern\r\nregions, made a sort of rushing and rattling noise. This, however,\r\nseems to be false, for Captain Lyons used to stand on the ice with his\r\nears uncovered till they were nearly frost-bitten, listening with the\r\nutmost attention, but he could never hear the slightest sound. A very\r\nintelligent Danish traveller says, that he has often heard the sound,\r\nbut that he is convinced of its being produced by the wind blowing upon\r\nthe ice. The reason of its being heard while the Aurora is shining,\r\nseems to be that the Aurora often appears when it is windy, or has\r\nsomething to do with a change of weather, which also occasions the\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nThe Aurora often appears in this country, but not with nearly so much\r\nbrilliancy or frequency, as in more northern countries. I have,\r\nhowever, seen it very beautifully developed in light tints of red,\r\nyellow, and green, but very seldom with a clear outline and determinate\r\nform. It appears that it has been observed here much oftener than\r\nformerly, within the last hundred years, and this applies to nearly\r\nthe whole of Europe, where it occurs. In Sweden, before the year 1716,\r\nit was a great rarity, and about the same time the inhabitants of\r\nIceland were alarmed at its becoming so much more frequent than it had\r\npreviously been, supposing that it portended some great misfortunes to\r\nbe coming upon them. A similar fancy prevailed amongst ignorant persons\r\nin this country, and I have heard that people used to imagine that the\r\nappearance was a sign of an approaching war.\r\n\r\nI have very little to say to you respecting the cause of this wonderful\r\nphenomenon. The most reasonable notion seems to be, that it is\r\noccasioned by electric fluid playing about, and diffusing itself in\r\nthe upper regions of the atmosphere, where the air is very thin. A\r\nsimilar kind of light is produced by a very pretty experiment, which\r\nconsists in sending an electric spark through a long glass vessel, from\r\nwhich the air has been exhausted. When the air is more compressed,\r\nas it is near the surface of the earth, the electric fluid does not\r\nso spread itself abroad, but moves in more direct lines, and in\r\nmore compact masses, as you may see in lightning, or in the sparks\r\nof an electrifying machine sent into the atmosphere under ordinary\r\ncircumstances of density.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPARLEY TELLS OF SOME OTHER METEORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARHELIA OR MOCK SUNS.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many very wonderful appearances in a polar sky,\r\nbesides the Aurora Borealis. Perhaps the most remarkable of these are\r\nParhelia, or \"mock suns,\" which are often seen to shine in various\r\nparts of the sky. As many as six of them are sometimes seen at once,\r\nall shining with great brilliancy. They are generally brightest just\r\nbefore day-break, and fade away as the true sun ascends.\r\n\r\nParhelia have also been seen at different times on the continent of\r\nEurope. At Marienberg, in Prussia, many years ago, towards evening,\r\none was observed which seemed attached to a small white cloud that\r\nwas situated just below the sun. It was at first of a reddish colour,\r\nbut as the sun descended towards it, it assumed the aspect of the sun\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThree at once were seen at Sudbury, in Suffolk, and two were seen in a\r\npart of Rutlandshire. There are recorded many other appearances of this\r\nremarkable phenomenon, but they do not seem to differ much from each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThere is great uncertainty as to what occasions these mock suns.\r\nPerhaps they are merely reflections of the image of the true sun\r\nupon reflecting clouds, such as I shall describe to you presently.\r\nThe circumstance that seems to render this probable, is that they\r\nsometimes become brighter as the sun approaches them, which cannot\r\neasily be accounted for by supposing them to have any source of light\r\nin themselves. On the contrary, their fading away at times as he rises,\r\nmay be occasioned by the clouds on which they are reflected, becoming\r\nrarified; or the effect may be only comparative, just as the moon grows\r\npaler, and at last disappears, as day comes on. Thus you see the two\r\nopposite effects of the sun's approach may be equally well accounted\r\nfor, on the supposition of the Parhelia being mere reflections of the\r\nsun, and I do not think that they could on any other.\r\n\r\n\r\nIGNES FATUI.\r\n\r\nThe name Ignis Fatuus, or False Fire, is applied to a flickering,\r\nbluish light, which is often seen in marshy districts, and in damp\r\nburial grounds, either on the surface of the earth or only a small\r\ndistance above it. So you see it is not strictly a wonder of the sky;\r\nbut I introduce it here because it seems to be somewhat similar to some\r\nof the higher meteors, in the manner in which it is occasioned.\r\n\r\nA great many entertaining stories are told of persons having mistaken\r\nthese Ignes Fatui for real lights, and it is said that benighted\r\ntravellers have frequently been led far astray by them. They are\r\nvulgarly called in various parts of the country, Will-o'-the-Whisp,\r\nJack-o'-the-Lantern, Peg with her Lantern, and in burying grounds in\r\nScotland, Grave Candles; and strange superstitious notions are annexed\r\nto them. They keep constantly in motion; now rising a few feet above\r\nthe earth, now sinking to the surface; now seeming to be close to you,\r\ndisappearing in an instant, and shining out at some distance; at times\r\none of them dividing into two, or two seeming to join into one.\r\n\r\nI will presently tell you how you can try a simple experiment,\r\nthat will go a great way towards accounting for these idle\r\nWill-o'-the-Whisps. The inflammable gas called Hydrogen, is copiously\r\nproduced by the decomposition of animal and vegetable bodies. The\r\nsubstance called Phosphorus, is contained in animal bodies, and is set\r\nat liberty in small quantities by their decomposition. When phosphorus\r\nand hydrogen come together under certain circumstances, they mix, and\r\na gas called Phosphuretted Hydrogen is the result.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, no difficulty in supposing that most marshy\r\ngrounds may produce this gas; and this experiment will show that it is\r\nvery likely that the Will-o'-the-Whisp is nothing more.\r\n\r\nHydrogen may be obtained by pouring diluted Sulphuric acid on small\r\npieces of Iron or Zinc. If you mix very small pieces of Phosphorus\r\nwith very small pieces of Zinc, and put them into a glass, and pour\r\nover them the acid, Phosphuretted Hydrogen will be sent off, and the\r\nsurface of the acid will be covered with a beautiful blue flame of\r\nthe very colour of the Ignis Fatuus. The cause of the flame is, that\r\nthe phosphuretted hydrogen is so wonderfully inflammable, that the\r\nmoment it comes into air of a common temperature, it bursts into flame.\r\nIf you try this experiment, you will see how likely it is that the\r\nWill-o'-the-Whisp is an escape of this gas from the surface of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSHOOTING STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few of you who have not seen _falling_ or _shooting stars_,\r\nas they are called. Perhaps some of you have loved to walk out when the\r\nstars have been shining brightly in the blue sky overhead, to watch for\r\nthese shy wanderers that seem to come from no where, just to draw a\r\nline of silver light across the heavens, and then disappear. When I was\r\na little child, I used to think that each appearance of this kind was\r\nthe destruction of one of the countless worlds that surround us, and\r\npossibly the same fancy may, at some time or other, have occurred to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nIf you have taken delight in watching for them, you have many a\r\ntime been disappointed, because they would not show themselves more\r\nfrequently. It is, for the most part, only now and then that you can\r\ncatch sight of one; but there have been some occasions on which they\r\nhave appeared in immense numbers.\r\n\r\nThe most astonishing multitude of them on record, appeared in the year\r\n1833, in the night of the 13th of November, and was seen over nearly\r\nthe whole of North America, from the Gulf of Mexico to Baffin's Bay.\r\nThey came from all quarters of the Heavens, and are said at one time\r\nto have been half as thick as the flakes in a heavy fall of snow. It\r\nwas calculated, on the most moderate grounds, that 36,000 must have\r\nappeared every hour for seven hours successively.\r\n\r\nPreviously, in the year 1799, also on the 13th of November, a similar\r\nphenomenon was observed by Humboldt, the celebrated traveller, by some\r\nMoravian Missionaries in Greenland, and by many persons in Germany.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1822, on the same day of the same month, almost as great a\r\nnumber were seen in several parts of Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1831, a French Officer states, that on the 13th of\r\nNovember, while off the coast of Spain, he saw on an average more than\r\ntwo a minute during several hours of the night.\r\n\r\nSimilar observations were made in the year 1835, in some parts of\r\nFrance; and from several other instances, there seems to be good reason\r\nfor believing that there are more falling stars about the middle of\r\nNovember, than during any other part of the year.\r\n\r\nThere have been a great many vague and silly notions devised to account\r\nfor these remarkable phenomena, and some that are not unreasonable,\r\nthough none perhaps quite satisfactory. It has been considered that\r\nthey were clouds of hydrogen gas, suddenly ignited by electricity,\r\nwithin the range of our own atmosphere, and indeed only a very few\r\nmiles above the earth. Recent investigations have, however, rendered\r\nit most probable that they are at very considerable elevations, often\r\nas much as 500 miles above us.\r\n\r\nBut supposing the circumstance of great multitudes of them appearing\r\njust at one particular period of the year, to be a fact, a new light\r\nis thrown upon their origin which must then be considered as decidedly\r\nof an astronomical character. The theory which has been proposed,\r\nis this:--that immense quantities of fragments of matter revolve in\r\nregular orbits in our solar system in various planes, and that on\r\nthe 13th of November the earth passes near the orbit in which the\r\ngreatest number of such fragments move. Whether they are matter in a\r\ngaseous state, or approaching it, or quite solid; or whether they are\r\nconstantly illuminated, or are only rendered luminous by their relation\r\nto other bodies, such as reflection, or meeting with electric fluid,\r\nand so becoming ignited, are questions which must remain unanswered.\r\nThere may be a slight evidence in favour of the notion of their\r\nlight not being permanent in themselves, from the fact of a French\r\nnaturalist having observed on the 17th of June in 1777, a very large\r\nnumber of small black spots pass over the sun's disc. If these spots\r\nwere really bodies, which under other circumstances would have been\r\nfalling stars, it should not be forgotten that the earth in June is\r\nnearly in the opposite part of its orbit to that which it passes over\r\nin November.\r\n\r\nWell, after all, this is a very doubtful subject, and we may possibly\r\nbe very much out in our notions; but it is always worth while to see\r\nwhich is the best of two theories, though there may be ever so little\r\nto choose between them. We should make the best of what knowledge we\r\nhave, and never lazily satisfy ourselves by saying--\"nobody can tell\r\nwhich is true,\" which is almost as bad as being too obstinate and\r\ndogmatical. For even if we adopt a conclusion which is wrong, we shall\r\nbe more ready to receive the truth when our knowledge may be increased,\r\nthan if we have no conclusion at all. One of the wisest men who ever\r\nlived, said--\"Truth comes more easily out of positive error than out of\r\nconfusion.\"\r\n\r\nYou who have been interested with what I have told you respecting\r\nshooting stars, should compare with it what I shall tell you in my next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMETEORIC STONES OR AEROLITES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were a great many accounts in very early times, of stones having\r\nfallen from the sky. In China and some other eastern nations, they have\r\nlong had a notion that such occurrences were connected with political\r\nevents, and accordingly they have kept careful records of what they\r\nhave known to fall for centuries back. This was a vain superstition,\r\nbut it was not more vain than the incredulity with which these reports\r\nwere received by nearly all the learned of Europe, till about forty\r\nyears ago. They denied the existence of aerolites, for no other reason\r\nthan because they had not seen them.\r\n\r\nSome new statements attracted the attention of scientific men in\r\nEngland and on the Continent, to the subject, about the beginning of\r\nthe present century, and the conclusion of their researches was, that\r\nstones of various sizes do, in reality, not unfrequently fall from\r\nabove to the earth.\r\n\r\nIt appears that sometimes they fall singly, and at other times in great\r\nnumbers. I will relate to you some particular instances.\r\n\r\nNear Benares, in the East Indies, in the month of December in the\r\nyear 1798, a very bright meteor seemed to fall to the earth, about 8\r\no'clock in the evening, and a loud noise like thunder was heard, which\r\nwas followed by a shock like the fall of heavy bodies. No cloud was to\r\nbe seen in the sky. The light of the meteor was so great as to cast\r\nvery distinct shadows of the objects in its way. The ground where it\r\nappeared to have fallen, was afterwards examined, and was found to\r\nbe strangely torn up, having a number of small holes in it about six\r\ninches deep. At the bottom of each hole was an aerolite weighing on\r\nthe average about one pound and a half.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1803, a similar event took place in Normandy. The meteor,\r\nwhen first seen, must have been at a very great elevation, for the\r\ninhabitants of two places more than a league distant from each other,\r\nthought it was just over their respective towns. A hissing noise was\r\nalso heard, like that of a stone hurled by a sling. The space over\r\nwhich the stones were dispersed, must have been more than eight miles\r\nlong and three wide. There were about two thousand of them collected,\r\nof various weights, from two drachms to seventeen pounds.\r\n\r\nTwo stones, one of which weighed 200 and the other 300 pounds, fell in\r\nthe year 1668, at Verona. In 1680, several small ones are said to have\r\nfallen in London. In 1628, several fell near Hatford, in Berkshire, one\r\nof which weighed twenty-four pounds. In 1795, one weighing fifty-five\r\npounds, fell in Yorkshire. In 1810, a large aerolite fell, which was\r\nthe means of setting fire to five villages, and killing several\r\npersons, in India. The largest of these are, however, small compared\r\nwith some which are said, and there is good reason to believe, to have\r\nfallen from the sky, at some time or other. One of these, now at Bahia,\r\nin Brazil, weighs 14,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThis is a cut of an aerolite in the British Museum, which fell in\r\nBuenos Ayres. It weighs 1,400 pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey are generally covered over with a thin crust, which is quite\r\nblack, and have a very rough surface. Internally, they are greyish\r\nand of a granulated texture. By the help of a microscope, you may\r\ndistinguish roundish grains of a grey colour; others, like rusty iron;\r\nsome, angular pieces of perfectly metallic iron, which are attracted\r\nby the magnet; and the rest is an earthy sort of cement in which the\r\nothers are embedded. Their chemical composition is very uniform, with\r\nthe exception of some that consist almost entirely of iron; of which\r\nsort is the one represented on the preceding page.\r\n\r\nTheir descent appears to be quite independent of the state of the\r\natmosphere, from whence we may infer that the clouds have nothing at\r\nall to do with them, but that they come from much higher regions.\r\nWhen they have been found soon after falling, they have always been\r\nextremely hot, and, as I told you of one in India, they have been known\r\nto set on fire what they have come in contact with on the surface of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThere have been four schemes devised to account for the existence of\r\naerolites. It has been imagined that they were substances which had\r\nbeen cast out by volcanoes to immense heights from distant parts of the\r\nworld; but this is disproved by the fact that no substance of the same\r\ncomposition as aerolites, has ever been discovered amongst the known\r\nproducts of volcanoes.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Frenchman, La Place, thought they were substances that\r\nhad been cast out by volcanoes in the moon, with such violence as to\r\nsend them within the limits of the earth's attraction.\r\n\r\nSome have conjectured that they are formed in the air by the\r\nconsolidation of clouds of gaseous matters exhaled from the earth;\r\nbut according to Sir H. Davy's view of the nature of flame, the light\r\nof meteors must arise from the ignition of _solid_ bodies, so that\r\nat least they must become solid while they are in the condition of\r\nmeteors, and long enough before they approach the earth.\r\n\r\nI will tell you what I think, according to the present state of our\r\nknowledge, the likeliest explanation, though I do not say that the\r\nreasons in favour of it are very conclusive. You will remember what I\r\ntold you respecting the probability of falling stars being fragments\r\nof matter revolving in orbits, which the earth at certain times comes\r\nnear in its annual course round the sun. I suppose shooting stars and\r\naerolites to be the same things, only they are shooting stars while\r\nthey show in the sky, and aerolites after they have reached the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nBLOODY RAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are on record several instances of a fall of red liquid exactly\r\nresembling blood in appearance, which has often been accompanied by a\r\ndescent of aerolites. On the 15th of November 1755, there was a heavy\r\nshower of this kind at Ulm, and several parts of Russia and Sweden.\r\nThere was another, March 5, 1803, in Apulia, where it seemed to fall\r\nfrom a reddish black cloud. A descent of large quantities of dry dust\r\npreceded the latter, and has on several occasions occurred by itself.\r\n\r\nBefore this phenomenon was understood, you will easily suppose that\r\nit was looked upon as something dreadfully portentous, and the more\r\nso from its occurring so unfrequently. It is now known to be closely\r\nrelated to the aerolites, as you shall hear.\r\n\r\nSome of the liquid, looking just like congealed blood, which fell at\r\nUlm, was examined. It was found to have a sour taste, owing, as it\r\nwas thought, to the presence of sulphuric acid. When dried, the dust\r\nthat remained, which constituted the colouring matter, was found to\r\nbe subject to magnetic attraction, and in other respects to resemble\r\nthe substance of the meteoric stones; so there can be no doubt that\r\nthe dust is nothing more than what is caused by the fracture or the\r\nfriction one against the other, of aerolites, and that the rain is made\r\nred by the dust falling on the clouds, from which it is precipitated.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED SNOW.\r\n\r\nSeveral travellers have witnessed the existence of snow of a bright red\r\ncolour, in various parts of Baffin's Bay; and at Arezzo, in Italy, in\r\nMarch 1813, there was a fall of it, which lasted many hours.\r\n\r\nThere seems some reason to suppose that in the latter instance the\r\nredness was caused by aerolite dust; but a microscopic examination of\r\nsome of that at Baffin's Bay, has proved that its colour is owing to a\r\nstill more wonderful cause. The colouring particles are actually small\r\nplants or fungi, which take root and grow, and bear seed upon the snow\r\nitself!\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of this Lilliputian vegetation? One full-sized plant\r\nis no more than 1-1600th of an inch in diameter; and to cover a single\r\nsquare inch of its _cold bed_ of snow, 2,500,000 are necessary! It has\r\nbeen named by its discoverer, Mr. Bauer, _Uredo Nivalis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOWERS OF FROGS AND FISH.\r\n\r\nI dare say you have heard, before now, of its raining frogs and fish. I\r\nlike that you should have correct notions on these things, so I shall\r\njust tell you what seems to have given rise to these reports.\r\n\r\nIf you understood what I told you respecting the water-spout, you will\r\nsee how likely it is that any small fish that may be on the spot,\r\nshould be sucked upwards along with the water, even to the very top of\r\nthe spout; now they might be kept up there as long as the whirlwind\r\nkept up a rotatory motion in the cloud, after it had ceased to sustain\r\nthe column of water drawn up from the sea. When the whirlwind was\r\nexhausted, the little fish would naturally fall out of the cloud,\r\nperhaps after it had travelled far from where the water-spout occurred.\r\n\r\nIf the water-spout had passed over fresh-water lakes or rivers, frogs\r\nmight be drawn up instead of fish, and let fall in the same manner.\r\n\r\nBut I will relate to you another circumstance, which may have been\r\nimputed to a descent of fish from the clouds. I told you in the first\r\npart of this book respecting the alluvions, or torrents of mud, which\r\nmake their way after an eruption down the sides of Mount Vesuvius.\r\nIn some of the great volcanoes of South America, these alluvions have\r\nnot to be formed in the regular way, but mud of the consistence of pap\r\nis ejected from the craters themselves in amazing quantities. This\r\nmud is supplied by subterranean waters connected with the volcanic\r\nchannel, and it often contains myriads of little fishes of the kind\r\ncalled _Pimelodes Cyclopum_: they are generally about four inches long,\r\nand they exist in such vast numbers, that their putrifying has before\r\nnow bred a pestilence in the neighbourhood of the Volcano. There are\r\nplenty of the same fish in the contiguous streams. What renders the\r\ncircumstance so wonderful, is their being raised up to the level of\r\n8 or 9000 feet, and then thrown out from the crater with very little\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVIII.\r\n\r\nSPECTRE OF THE BROCKEN]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE SPECTRE OF THE BROCKEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am going to tell you respecting some of the appearances produced\r\nby clouds which reflect like mirrors; and by those changes in the\r\natmosphere which turn aside, in an irregular manner, the rays of light,\r\nwhich, as they pass from an object to the eye which is looking at it,\r\nexcite the sensation called vision.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable of these, has long been known by the name\r\nof \"The Spectre of the Brocken.\" The Brocken is the loftiest summit of\r\nthe Hartz Mountains, in Germany; it is said to be 3,300 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, and to command the prospect of a tract of land which\r\nis inhabited by more than five millions of people.\r\n\r\nIt appears that clouds, from some cause or other, which perhaps we\r\nshall never perfectly know, are wont at times to collect on the\r\nneighbouring heights, and reflect a very distinct shadow of great size\r\nof whatever object may be on the summit of the Brocken, when the sun\r\nis rising and casts his beams horizontally. The best account of this\r\nwonderful spectacle, is given by the Abbe Hauy, who visited it in 1797,\r\nand I shall give you his own statement.\r\n\r\n\"After having been here for the thirtieth time,\" says Mons. Hauy,\r\n\"I was at length so fortunate as to have the pleasure of seeing the\r\nSpectre. The sun rose about four o'clock, and the atmosphere being\r\nquite serene towards the east, his rays could pass without any\r\nobstruction over the Heinrichshohe.[A] In the south-west, however,\r\ntowards Achtermanshohe,[B] a brisk west wind carried before it thin\r\ntransparent vapours, which were not yet condensed into thick heavy\r\nclouds. About a quarter past four I went towards the inn, and looked\r\nround to see whether the atmosphere would permit me to have a free\r\nprospect to the south-west; when I observed, at a very great distance\r\ntowards Achtermanshohe, a human figure of a monstrous size. A violent\r\ngust of wind having almost carried away my hat, I clapped my hand\r\nto it by moving my arm towards my head, and the colossal figure did\r\nthe same. The pleasure which I felt on this discovery can hardly be\r\ndescribed, for I had already walked many a weary step in the hopes of\r\nseeing this shadowy image, without being able to gratify my curiosity.\r\nI immediately made another movement by bending my body, and the\r\ncolossal figure before me repeated it. I was desirous of doing the\r\nsame thing once more; but my colossus had vanished: I remained in the\r\nsame position, waiting to see whether it would return, and in a few\r\nminutes it again made its appearance on the Achtermanshohe. I paid\r\nmy respects to it a second time, and it did the same to me. I then\r\ncalled the landlord of the Brocken; and having both taken the same\r\nposition which I had taken alone, we looked towards the Achtermanshohe,\r\nbut saw nothing. We had not, however, stood long, when two such\r\ncolossal figures were formed over the above eminence, which repeated\r\nour compliments by bending their bodies as we did; after which they\r\nvanished. We retained our position, kept our eyes fixed on the same\r\nspot, and in a little time the two figures again stood before us, and\r\nwere joined by a third,\" (most likely by the double reflection of one\r\nof the spectators.) \"Every movement that we made by bending our bodies,\r\nthese figures imitated; but with this difference, that the phenomenon\r\nwas sometimes weak and faint, sometimes strong and well defined.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: Two others of the Hartz mountains.]\r\n\r\nThere are some remarkable circumstances attending the Brocken, that\r\nare doubtless in some degree connected with \"The Spectre,\" which\r\nwas once looked upon as a supernatural apparition. When Christianity\r\nwas introduced into Germany, the priests and votaries of the old\r\nsuperstition, retired to the Brocken as a refuge, and there long kept\r\nup the dark and mysterious rites of the great Saxon idol, Cortho. It is\r\na very wild place, full of clefts and caverns, and with rivulets and\r\nwaterfalls on all sides of it, so that it would answer their purpose\r\nremarkably well. After the inhabitants had taken up the profession of\r\nChristianity, they used to celebrate on this mountain a festival on\r\nMidsummer night, in honour of St. Walpurgis, a female saint, who had\r\nfirst introduced Christianity among them. A legend then prevailed,\r\nthat the summit of the mountain was occasionally haunted by a demon,\r\nwhich could have been no other than the Spectre. Everything about the\r\nmountain was looked upon with awe and veneration. A beautiful spring\r\nwhich runs down its side, is at this day called the Magic Spring;\r\na pretty little lily that abounds on the Mountain, is called the\r\nWizard's Flower; and two great square granite rocks are called the\r\nWizard's Chair. These names may be looked upon as monuments of the\r\nestimation in which the mountain was once held.\r\n\r\nWhile you ought, my young friends, to feel happy and grateful in being\r\ntaught what these natural things really are, and released from all\r\nsuperstitious fears or notions respecting them; you should be most\r\ncareful not to forget what you owe to a purer faith, of which the\r\ncharacter is to invite you to inquire into, and to know everything\r\nwithin your reach.\r\n\r\nI shall say something to you respecting the cause of the Spectre, in a\r\nfuture chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSOME OTHER INSTANCES OF AERIAL REFLECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has been something very like the Spectre of the Brocken, seen on\r\nSouter Fell, a mountain about half a mile high, in Cumberland.\r\n\r\nOne summer's evening, in the year 1743, as a farmer, named John Wren,\r\nand his servant were sitting at the door of his cottage, they saw a man\r\nwith a dog furiously chasing some horses along a ledge on the side of\r\nthe mountain which they knew was so narrow that a horse could hardly\r\nstand upon it. They seemed to go round one end of the mountain, and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the farmer and his servant went round the track which\r\nthe horses and man had seemed to take, fully expecting to find that\r\nthey had fallen over and been killed. You may guess how surprised they\r\nwere to find no trace whatever of them, not even the mark of a hoof on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nWell, they said nothing of what they had seen, and perhaps they almost\r\nforgot it by nearly the same season in the following year, when the\r\nservant, whose name was Daniel Strickett, saw one evening a whole troop\r\nof horsemen trot along the mountain-side, near the same spot. It seems\r\nthat he had been laughed at by those to whom he had related the other\r\napparition, so he was rather timid, and resolved to be well assured\r\nof the reality of this one before he mentioned it. He looked at the\r\nfigures for a considerable time, and then called another person to\r\nwitness the sight with him. Several others afterwards joined them, and\r\ncontinued looking at the aerial horsemen till it was quite dark. All\r\nthese circumstances were attested before a magistrate in the year 1785:\r\ntwenty-six persons are said to have been spectators of the sight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIX.\r\n\r\nDOVER CASTLE]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT A FRIEND OF PARLEY'S SAW.\r\n\r\nA gentleman with whom I am acquainted, who lives in the country, told\r\nme that he once left some labourers at the bottom of a very steep\r\nhill, whom he had ordered to do some earth work. As he was going down,\r\nintending to visit them again, about sun-set, he saw a part of the hill\r\nwhich he was descending, and one of the labourers wheeling a barrow\r\nupon the side of it, reflected on a cloud opposite with the greatest\r\ndistinctness. Though it was quite impossible that he could see the men\r\nin their true position, he knew exactly what this man was about, and\r\nwhat work had been done, from the reflected image.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOVER CASTLE.\r\n\r\nDover Castle stands upon the side of a hill, and when looked at from\r\nthe side towards Ramsgate, its four turrets may be just seen peeping\r\nover the top of the hill. You may see how it appears in the upper\r\nfigure of plate XIX. On the 6th of August 1806, when Professor Vince,\r\nof Cambridge, was staying near Ramsgate, he was astonished to see the\r\nappearance of the castle as if it stood on the side of the hill next to\r\nhim, as is represented in the lower figure of the plate. It continued\r\nso for nearly half an hour, during which he looked at it several times\r\nwith a telescope, and the image appeared quite clear and distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT HUMBOLDT SAW IN SOUTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nWhen Humboldt was residing at Cumana, he frequently saw two small\r\nislands which lie off the coast, suspended in the air. He once saw\r\nsome fishing boats seeming to float in the air for several minutes. In\r\nanother place he and his companion saw the figures of cows in the air\r\nat a great height; and they were told by a person worthy of credit,\r\nthat he had seen the forms of horses suspended in like manner, but with\r\ntheir legs upwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT CAPTAIN SCORESBY SAW IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS.\r\n\r\nCaptain Scoresby relates several remarkable appearances of a similar\r\nkind, one of which I will describe to you. He saw one morning the\r\ninverted image of a ship in the air, which he at once recognized to\r\nbe that in which his father was sailing. \"It was,\" says he, \"so well\r\ndefined, that I could distinguish by a telescope every sail, the\r\ngeneral rig of the ship, and its particular character; insomuch that\r\nI confidently pronounced it to be my father's ship, 'The Fame,' which\r\nit afterwards proved to be; though on comparing notes with my father,\r\nI found that our relative position at the time, gave a distance from\r\none another of thirty miles, being about seventeen miles beyond the\r\nhorizon, and some leagues beyond the limit of direct vision.\"\r\n\r\nMany other such things have been related by travellers, but with very\r\nlittle variation of circumstance.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARENT DISTANCE OF OBJECTS.\r\n\r\nIf you have never noticed the fact, you will be surprised to observe\r\nwhat a great difference appears to exist in the distance of the same\r\nobjects under different states of the atmosphere. I do not mean when it\r\nis merely clearer than at another time, but when it is equally clear,\r\nthe same object will show much higher above the horizon, and therefore\r\nseem to be nearer to some given spot, than at other times. We who have\r\nbeen at sea, have often seen this when we have been approaching land;\r\nbut you will better understand an instance which occurred at Hastings,\r\non the coast of Sussex. The gentleman who related it was surprised\r\none day to see a crowd of people running down to the sea-side, and on\r\ninquiry he found they were going in consequence of a report that the\r\ncoast of France had become visible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nHe went down to the beach, and actually saw the coast of France so\r\nplainly as to be able to distinguish objects, and with a telescope he\r\neven clearly saw French fishing-boats at anchor, close to the shore.\r\nThe illusion lasted for more than an hour, and occasionally grew faint\r\nand then brightened again. The distance is fifty miles, and Hastings\r\nwould therefore be hidden from the opposite coast of France by the\r\nconvexity of the earth; so that if a straight line were drawn from one\r\nto the other, it would pass through the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nOF THE FATA MORGANA AND THE MIRAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a very remarkable spectacle to be occasionally seen between\r\nthe coasts of Italy and Sicily, which the inhabitants call Fata\r\nMorgana, or _Fairy Illusion_.\r\n\r\nThe shores on each side are rich and beautiful in the extreme, and the\r\nnarrow strait being very deep, looks always blue and fresh. According\r\nto the best accounts of the Fata Morgana, it appears only when the sun\r\nis elevated at an angle of 45°. It consists in a reflection of the\r\nobjects on the shore more or less magnified, multiplied, distorted, and\r\noften decorated with the hues of the rainbow on the surface of the sea\r\nitself, and the portion of the atmosphere which is in immediate contact\r\nwith it. The inhabitants of the neighbourhood look on it as a good\r\nomen, and whenever it appears, run down to the sea-side joyously crying\r\nout, Morgana! Morgana!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XX.\r\n\r\nFATA MORGANA]\r\n\r\nThose who have seen it, declare that nothing can be more beautiful. The\r\nscene must look as wonderful as anything you have ever read about in\r\na fairy tale. Castles, palaces, temples, of the utmost magnificence,\r\nhouses, hills and valleys, woods, green pastures, all of the brightest\r\ncolours, and indeed every one of the beautiful objects on shore,\r\nbeautified tenfold. You will see in the plate the attempt of an\r\nintelligent traveller to convey a notion of this glorious phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MIRAGE.\r\n\r\nThis name is given to similar illusions which are seen in various parts\r\nof the world, and more particularly to the illusive appearance of\r\nwater, which is frequent in the sandy deserts of the East. You shall\r\nhear what the celebrated traveller, Dr. Clarke, says of it.\r\n\r\n\"We procured asses for our party, and, setting out for Rosetta, began\r\nto re-cross the desert, which appeared like an ocean of sand, but\r\nflatter and firmer as to its surface, than before. The Arabs, uttering\r\ntheir harsh guttural language, ran chattering by the side of our asses;\r\nuntil some of them calling out '_Raschid!_' we perceived its domes and\r\nturrets, apparently upon the opposite side of an immense lake or sea,\r\nthat covered all the intervening space between us and the city. Not\r\nhaving in my own mind, at the time, any doubt as to the certainty of\r\nits being water, and seeing the tall minarets and buildings of Rosetta,\r\nwith all its groves of dates and sycamores, as perfectly reflected\r\nby it as by a mirror, insomuch that even the minutest detail of the\r\narchitecture, and of the trees, might have been thence delineated, I\r\napplied to the Arabs to be informed in what manner we were to pass the\r\nwater. Our interpreter, although a Greek, and therefore likely to have\r\nbeen informed of such a phenomenon, was as fully convinced as any of\r\nus that we were drawing near to the water's edge, and became indignant\r\nwhen the Arabs maintained, that within an hour we should reach Rosetta,\r\nby crossing the sands in the direct line we then pursued, and that\r\nthere was no water. 'What,' said he, giving way to his impatience,\r\n'do you suppose me an idiot, to be persuaded contrary to the evidence\r\nof my senses?' The Arabs, smiling, soon pacified him, and completely\r\nastonished the whole party, by desiring us to look back at the desert\r\nwe had already passed, where we beheld a precisely similar appearance.\r\nIt was, in fact, _the Mirage_, a prodigy to which every one of us were\r\nthen strangers, although it afterwards became more familiar. Yet upon\r\nno future occasion did we ever behold this extraordinary illusion\r\nso marvellously displayed. The view of it enabled us to imagine the\r\nhorrible despondency to which travellers must sometimes be exposed,\r\nwho, in traversing the interminable desert, destitute of water, and\r\nperishing with thirst, have sometimes this deceitful prospect before\r\ntheir eyes.\"\r\n\r\nAnother traveller adds a particular which is well worthy of notice.\r\n\r\n\"The most singular quality of this vapour is its power of reflection.\r\nWhen a near observer is a little elevated, as on horseback, he will see\r\ntrees and other objects reflected as from the surface of a lake. The\r\nvapour, when seen at a distance of six or seven miles, appears to lie\r\nupon the earth like an opaque mass; and it certainly does not rise many\r\nfeet above the ground, for I observed that, while the lower part of\r\nthe town of Abusheher was hid from the view, some of the more elevated\r\nbuildings, and the tops of a few date-trees, were distinctly visible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nHOW PARLEY SUPPOSES THESE APPEARANCES TO BE PRODUCED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you wish to understand the manner in which it is most probable that\r\nthese illusions are produced, you must closely attend to what I am\r\ngoing to tell you. I will make my explanation as simple as I can, but I\r\nshall be able to teach you nothing, unless you do your part by paying\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nYou know that vision is produced by rays of light passing from the\r\nobject seen, to the eye of the spectator. These rays have a tendency\r\nto form straight lines, and they would be perfectly straight, if they\r\nhad only to pass through empty space; but this cannot be the case near\r\nthe surface of the earth, as they there have to go through air, and\r\nfrequently through other transparent substances.\r\n\r\nWhen these rays meet with a substance which they cannot go through, and\r\nwhich is therefore called opaque, such as a man or a house, they are\r\nturned back or _reflected_, and strike the eye of the person who may be\r\nlooking in that direction, so as to cause vision.\r\n\r\nBut when they meet with a body which they can pass through, called\r\ntherefore transparent, such as water or glass, they are turned aside\r\nout of their original course or _refracted_; and this refraction takes\r\nplace in different degrees, according to the density of the substance.\r\n\r\nThus, in looking at objects through air, you do not see anything\r\nexactly in its real position; but in looking at them through water,\r\nthe variation between the reality and the appearance is still greater,\r\nbecause the density of water being greater than that of air, it will\r\nrefract more. To prove this you need only put a stick obliquely into\r\nwater, and it will look as if it were broken or bent at the surface of\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe true position of the stick is marked by A B, and the apparent\r\nposition, by A C.\r\n\r\nWe see the rising sun some minutes before he has risen above our\r\nhorizon, and the setting sun after he has sunk below it, because his\r\nrays are refracted by our atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf the sun be at A, he will appear to a spectator on the surface of the\r\nearth at C, as if he were at B, because the rays will be refracted at\r\nD, which represents the limit of the atmosphere, towards C.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you knew all this before. Well, the knowledge of these laws\r\nwill very nearly enable you to understand the wonders of which I have\r\ntold you. I will try to explain to you the manner in which it seems\r\nthat the appearances are produced by the operation of the laws.\r\n\r\nIf a ray pass through a body that refracts it from its original course,\r\nit will go on when it has got through, in a line parallel with its\r\nfirst direction.\r\n\r\nThus, let A B be a thick piece of glass, and C D, a ray of light\r\npassing through it, which would be refracted from _c_ to _d_; C _c_\r\nwould be exactly parallel to _d_ D, and the point C would be seen from\r\nD as if it were at E.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf you think a little upon this, you will see that nothing is necessary\r\nto account for objects appearing nearer to a given point at one time\r\nthan another, or objects upon the earth appearing high up in the air,\r\nexcept different degrees of refraction. Thus in the instance of the\r\ncoast of France seeming to approach Hastings, it is evident that the\r\neffect would be produced by an extraordinary degree of refraction in a\r\nstratum of air over the sea, through which the rays of light producing\r\nvision must come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe explanation will be the same as that of the diagram of the rising\r\nsun in a former page; if the ray from A took the direction D, as under\r\nordinary circumstances it would do, it is evident that a spectator at\r\nC would see nothing. But instead of this, the ray was refracted near\r\nthe middle to the point C, which represents the town of Hastings, and\r\ntherefore the object A appeared as if it had been placed at B. You\r\nshall now hear what causes are likely to alter the refracting power of\r\nthe air at times.\r\n\r\nWhen air, water, or any other substance, is made hot, it becomes\r\nrarified, and its refracting power is thereby diminished. Have you ever\r\nwatched, while you have been on one side of a stove, or of any heated\r\nbody, the appearance of things on the other side through the air above\r\nit? If so, you must have seen how strangely they seem to tremble. Now\r\nthis is caused by a stream of irregularly heated air rising from the\r\nstove, and enabling you every instant to see the things beyond it more\r\nnearly in their true position than you can through air of the ordinary\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nIf you look through a magnifying glass at distant objects, they will\r\nappear upside down. You may learn why this takes place from books on\r\noptics. The same effect is produced by rays passing through a medium\r\nwhich becomes gradually denser, instead of suddenly passing from one\r\nstate to another. Thus, if you take a square glass bottle and put some\r\nclear syrup into it, and then carefully pour water on the top of that,\r\nanything, such as a written or printed line, seen through the space\r\nwhere the liquids are mixing, will appear inverted.\r\n\r\nAgain, if you take a tin tube full of water, stopped with a piece of\r\nplain glass at each end, warm the middle of the tube, and then look at\r\none end, you will see an object at the other end, if held at a proper\r\ndistance, magnified, and distant objects turned upside down, just as\r\nthey would be by a convex lens. If, on the contrary, you cool the\r\nmiddle of the tube, by applying ice to it, the same ensues as by using\r\na concave lens. If a space of cold air be between two spaces of hot\r\nair, or the contrary, a space of hot air be between two spaces of cold\r\nair, the effects would be the same, only they could not be produced in\r\nso small a compass as they could with water. The space where the two\r\ndifferent temperatures were gradually mixing, would influence the rays\r\nof light in the same manner as a lens on a very large scale.\r\n\r\nNow portions of air are often made of different temperature by the\r\nsun's rays, by evaporation, as from the surface of the sea, or\r\nof lakes, or from marshy districts, and by winds operating under\r\nparticular local circumstances. I do not want to lengthen out this dry\r\nstory, but if you have read attentively what I have said, you will see\r\nthat various positions of masses of air heated to different degrees,\r\nis all that is necessary to account for the instances which I have\r\nmentioned, in which objects have appeared inverted and out of their\r\ntrue positions; such as Dover Castle, Captain Scoresby's father's ship,\r\nthe French coast opposite Hastings, and the islands, and horses with\r\ntheir legs upwards, described by Humboldt.\r\n\r\nThe apparitions of Souter Fell may be accounted for in like manner.\r\nThe latter one was seen at a time of civil commotion, when there were\r\nprivate troops of horse exercised in all parts of the country, and so\r\nthe fact of armed horsemen being in the neighbourhood, is rendered\r\nvery probable. We have only to suppose the image of such a troop to be\r\nbrought to the side of Souter Fell, perhaps from the opposite side of\r\nthe mountain, by a complicated refraction, like that which appeared to\r\nmove Dover Castle out of its place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the Spectre of the Brocken, the Fata Morgana, and the image which\r\nmy friend saw of the side of the hill on which he was, require another\r\nsort of explanation, because the object and the image are seen both at\r\nonce; the latter could therefore have been no other than the reflection\r\nof the first.\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that some vapours are capable of receiving shadows.\r\nWhen I have been bathing in a river with a muddy bottom, I have often\r\nseen my shadow on the cloud of muddy particles which I have disturbed\r\nfrom the bottom, in a manner something similar to that in which I\r\nshould think this may occasionally take place.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another theory of it. When rays pass from a thin\r\nmedium into a denser medium, the whole do not go through, but they are\r\n_strained_, as it were, and a part are kept back and reflected. It is\r\nthus that you see a reflection on a transparent pane of glass.\r\n\r\nIf you breathe very lightly upon it, the reflection will be still more\r\ndistinct, and the resemblance to the phenomenon we are describing\r\nprobably greater. There are then two causes of reflection, the change\r\nof refracting power, and the presence of the watery particles.\r\n\r\nSomething of this kind perhaps occurs on the top of the Brocken. A rush\r\nof cold air may set up from deep ravines, with water and marshy land at\r\nthe bottom, on the West side, while the rising sun is genially warming\r\nthe air on the east side of the mountains. Mind, I do not say that it\r\nis so, but it does not seem unlikely that two currents, one of cold air\r\nand the other of hot, thus ascend close to each other; and according to\r\nwhat I have told you, there would be a reflecting power in the plane\r\nof contact, which might be increased by the watery particles carried\r\nupwards.\r\n\r\nA kind of aerial screen would thus be formed, which might catch\r\nthe shadow of a person on the opposite summit, cast upon it by the\r\nhorizontal rays of the morning sun. Thus you may account for the image,\r\nand its being so greatly magnified, requires no further explanation\r\nthan I have given above; as it only needs the supposition of a mass\r\nof heated air, with two colder ones on each side, being between the\r\npersons and the reflecting substance.\r\n\r\nThe doubling of one of the figures was possibly occasioned by a\r\nreflecting surface having been formed on a different plane from the\r\nfirst, which might very easily occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nOF SOME OTHER WONDERS, AND HOW WE OUGHT TO USE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE\r\nWONDERS OF NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. I have now given you, my little friends an account of a few of\r\nthe wonders of the wonderful world we live in, and I hope they have\r\nentertained you. I should like to have spoken to you of a great many\r\nother things, but it would make my book too large.\r\n\r\nSome of you, I dare say, are fond of some branch or other of natural\r\nhistory, and perhaps you may be in the habit of collecting shells,\r\nplants, insects, or fossils. Well, I hope a great many of you do so,\r\nfor it is a very delightful employment, when you are not learning your\r\nregular lessons. When I was a school-boy, I loved to dig fossils out\r\nof the earth, and many a sunny day have I spent with my hammer and\r\nchisel under the cliffs by the sea-side, or in a stone-quarry. Many\r\ntimes I laboured long without success, but at last I scraped together\r\na very pretty collection, and always managed to enjoy myself on these\r\nfossil-hunting days, whether I was successful or not.\r\n\r\nBut what I want particularly to say to you before we part is, that I\r\nhope none of you will rest satisfied with merely listening to what\r\nothers tell you, with making an orderly collection of specimens, or\r\nrecollecting merely the outsides of things. Though all these are very\r\ngood when in their proper places, they are not enough. You should\r\ncompare together different facts, and often turn them over in your\r\nminds, always keeping in view that there is something to be learned\r\nfrom them more interesting and more important than any knowledge,\r\nhowever correct, respecting the shapes of crystals, shells, or plants,\r\nor the habits of animals.\r\n\r\nIf you are diligent in thinking on what you know, you will see that\r\nnothing stands alone in nature; every single thing is connected with\r\nother things, so as to make up one great whole. It is true that you\r\nwill sometimes see what seems to be an exception to this; you will see\r\ninstances of conflict and disorder, and, as it seems, things destroyed\r\nwithout a reason; but you will also very often find, as you come to\r\nknow more, that what seemed at first an exception was not such in\r\nreality, and that it was what tends as much to the order and beauty of\r\nthe whole, as any of the particular things you admired at first.\r\n\r\nII. The ancients supposed that those parts of the world which were\r\nin the torrid zone, and those towards the North Pole, could not\r\nbe inhabited by man; and we find from their writings, that it was\r\nsomething of a puzzle to know of what use they could be. They did not,\r\nhowever, know much about the extent of them, for even the shape of the\r\nearth was then unknown,--some contending that it was in the form of a\r\ncylinder, some that it was pear-shaped, and others that it was round\r\nand flat like a trencher. A very few made a shrewd guess at its true\r\nfigure. No one was quite certain on the subject, till navigators had\r\nsailed round it, so as to reach, by continually going forward, the same\r\nspot as they started from.\r\n\r\nWhat men have learned within the last four centuries, has taught us\r\nthat only a small portion of the surface of the earth is uninhabitable.\r\nMan, by the wonderful constitution of his nature, is enabled to bear\r\nthe extremes of heat and cold better than any of the animals that\r\nare sent for his use, each of which is adapted for the particular\r\nclimate in which it may be placed. Under the most extreme variations\r\nof the temperature of the atmosphere, the heat of our bodies, when we\r\nare in health, is never increased or diminished more than a very few\r\ndegrees; so that a thermometer, with the bulb put into the mouth of an\r\nEsquimaux, in a climate much below freezing, will be only three or four\r\ndegrees below what it will be in the mouth of an inhabitant of the East\r\nIndies, where the temperature often exceeds 100 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe dog is almost the only animal that is prepared to accompany man in\r\nall climates. The form and habits of this faithful creature vary most\r\nsurprisingly, according to the circumstances in which he is placed;\r\nbut he is everywhere the loving friend and faithful associate of man,\r\nand ready to defend him and to share his toil, in the hot and parched\r\ndeserts of the East, or the icy regions of the North.\r\n\r\nThere are a few animals that undergo remarkable changes, to enable them\r\nto bear the vicissitudes of the climate in which they may be placed.\r\nThe hares and the foxes of the Northern regions become covered with\r\nwhite hair in winter. Now, it is proved, that a body hotter than the\r\nsurrounding atmosphere which has a white covering, cools much more\r\nslowly than one covered with a dark colour: hence, the heat generated\r\ninwardly is preserved and economized by the winter coats of these\r\nanimals, to the great benefit of their health and comfort.\r\n\r\nIII. Some kinds of birds that love warm climates, are taught to\r\nassemble together at a certain season near the end of summer, almost\r\nto a day, and start off on a pilgrimage to distant lands, where nature\r\nis still blooming. There are these birds which all live nearly the same\r\nsort of life,--the swift, the swallow, and the house marten, which\r\nall bear a strong resemblance to each other. They all come to us from\r\nthe south in spring, and take their departure before the next winter.\r\nThe swifts form themselves into companies, and take their leave of\r\nus before the middle of August; the swallows do the same about the\r\nmiddle of October, and the martens at the end of the same month. Thus\r\nthese happy creatures manage to live all their life long in summer and\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey are furnished with astonishing capabilities for performing these\r\nvery long journeys. You are acquainted with their slender forms, so\r\nexactly adapted for cutting through the air, and their long, beautiful\r\nwings. Each of these wings is moved by a muscle of prodigious power,\r\nsituated on each side of the breast-bone. Possibly you may have\r\nnoticed in larks and other birds, that are in the habit of flying long\r\ndistances, which are eaten, what a large proportion of their flesh is\r\nin these two muscles; in the swallow, it greatly exceeds the weight of\r\nthe flesh of all the other parts of the body. You will hardly believe\r\nit when I tell you, that the swift is able to fly at the rate of more\r\nthan a hundred miles in an hour. The little bird that perched upon\r\nyour chimney this morning, may perch to-morrow night upon one of the\r\npyramids of Egypt, and next week may be at the Cape of Good Hope. You\r\nthink a great deal of travelling twenty miles an hour on a railway, but\r\nyou see that is slow compared with the travelling of the swallows.\r\n\r\nInstead of thus following the summer about over the surface of the\r\nearth, some creatures, that love warmth, make the best of it where\r\nthey are. Some birds get into holes and other sheltered places, put\r\ntheir heads under their wings, and so sleep away the winter months. The\r\npretty little black-eyed dormouse makes up a snug nest, and does the\r\nsame, and so do some other of our common animals. During this inactive\r\nperiod, all the functions which are necessary to support life become\r\nfitted to a state of repose; the circulation gets slower, and the\r\nsupply of inward heat sinks to the lowest temperature which life will\r\nbear.\r\n\r\nI dare say you have often found some sorts of snail-shells with the\r\nsnail inside, and the mouth sealed up firmly, and have taken them for\r\ndead: this is not the case. The covering is only put over for the\r\nwinter to keep out the cold, and the creature lives till spring without\r\nfood or motion. How it must enjoy the first bright days of spring,\r\nwhen it opens its eyes after its long nap, reaching out its horns, and\r\ndragging its shell over the green grass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIV. Then, in the distribution of different animals, there is not less\r\nto engage our attention. The rein-deer is the support and comfort of\r\nthe Laplanders. It lives constantly on the scantiest, and apparently\r\nleast nourishing diet, and when brought into warmer climates it soon\r\nlanguishes and dies. The camel only flourishes where there are large\r\nsandy deserts, with precarious supplies both of water and solid food;\r\nand to fit him for his peculiar line of usefulness, he has a receptacle\r\nto contain a stock of water, which he can at pleasure turn into his\r\nstomach, and can go eight or nine days without a fresh supply; he eats\r\nany kind of vegetables, however dry they may be; and a pound a day is\r\nsufficient to support him for weeks together; though he is very much\r\nlarger than any of the animals which inhabit your country. It is usual\r\nfor camels to go the whole distance from Cairo to Suez, in Egypt,\r\nwithout tasting a morsel, and this remarkable faculty has been supposed\r\nto arise from the hump upon their backs. When the animal is well\r\nfed, this hump, which is of a fatty substance, fills out and becomes\r\nsolid; but when his food is scanty, it wastes away, and its substance\r\nappears to go to the nourishment of the more vital parts of his frame.\r\nHis large feet rest upon the sand without sinking in, and at the rate\r\nof about two miles an hour, he will travel thirty miles a day over a\r\nparched desert, bearing a burden of seven or eight hundred weight. He\r\nis called by the Arabs the Ship of the Desert.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nV. You may see that there is, in every variety of circumstance,\r\nsomething that enjoys itself, and has a place to fill up and a part to\r\nact amongst the creatures which God has made. But this is not all: the\r\nexistence of the cold of the Poles, and of the heat of the Tropics, is\r\nnecessary to the well-being of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe free air that surrounds the globe, which we breathe, and through\r\nwhich we see, and hear, and smell, and move, is the same in composition\r\nin every part of the world. It contains just the same proportions of\r\nthe two gases, oxygen and nitrogen, in the coldest and the hottest\r\nclimates, in the deepest valleys and on the tallest mountains. Now,\r\nthis air, considered on a large scale, is always blowing from the Poles\r\ntowards the Equator. The more direct rays of the sun heat that portion\r\nof the earth's surface which lies in the Torrid Zone, and therefore\r\nthe air above it is perpetually ascending to the upper regions of the\r\natmosphere, to make room for that which presses upon it from the Poles,\r\nbecause it is cooler and heavier.\r\n\r\nIt is this process, united with the motion of the earth on its axis,\r\nwhich causes the Trade Winds and Monsoons.\r\n\r\nNow, do you not see how necessary the cold Poles are to keep the rest\r\nof the world from becoming too hot, by supplying constant currents of\r\nfresh air setting in upon the hotter regions from both sides? Then the\r\nair, which ascends from the Equator, becomes cool, and travels down\r\nagain to join the air from the Poles; and so a healthful circulation is\r\nkept up, which is necessary for all climates.\r\n\r\nVI. It is very interesting to trace the dependance of the various\r\ntribes of vegetables and animals on each other, and to observe how one\r\nflourishes through the dissolution of another; and still more so to\r\nnotice the gradual development of the same parts in the kinds, as they\r\nascend one above another. You may see an instance of this in three of\r\nthe animals that I described to you, which were different enough in\r\nother respects, but agreed in being without a bony skeleton, and in\r\nhaving long organs round their mouths to catch their food with.\r\n\r\nIn the Acalephæ, or sea-nettles, these organs were merely filaments\r\nwithout sensation, of which the use seemed to be, to entangle little\r\ncreatures in, which chance might bring in their way. The animals\r\nthemselves would seem, at first sight, to be very ill able to destroy\r\nsmall crabs and other shell-fish. You would suppose that the struggles\r\nthey would make with their hard pointed legs, would tear the tender\r\nbodies of the Acalephæ; but the deficiency is supplied by the caustic\r\nluminous fluid which paralyzes the victim, and disables it for violent\r\nstruggles while it is detained by the filaments, before the Acalepha\r\nattempts to swallow it.\r\n\r\nIn the Actiniæ, you will find the loose disorderly filaments changed\r\ninto feelers, with wonderfully acute sensation, regularly disposed\r\nin a star. When a substance touches the feelers they close in with\r\nconsiderable power, but seem to act more like a mechanical trap,--as\r\nthe leaves of certain plants catch flies and other insects,--than in\r\ndirect dependance on the will of the animal. However, the Actinia has\r\nthe sense of feeling, and has a perception of light and of odours,\r\nthough without eyes or nose. Having greater muscular strength and\r\nmore compactures of film, he does not need the destructive fluid with\r\nwhich the Acalepha is furnished. Thus, one sort of power is made to\r\ncompensate for the loss of another.\r\n\r\nThe Sepia also catches his food by means of fleshy organs placed round\r\nhis mouth; but in him you find them possessed of amazing power, moving\r\nin strict subjection to his will; never loosely floating about as in\r\nthe others. Then he tastes, sees, and hears, by means of a tongue,\r\neyes, and ears, distinctly formed.\r\n\r\nA similar gradation is observed in the development of the various parts\r\ncomposing the hand and arm in animals with perfect skeletons, in which\r\nthe bones act as levers. There is a very interesting book[C] written\r\non this subject, which you would do well to read; and you will see\r\nin it that all sorts of birds, quadrupeds, and even fishes, have, in\r\ntheir fore feet, wings, and fore fins, elements resembling those of\r\nthe human hand and arm. Often, in comparing only two animals, you might\r\nfail to trace the slightest resemblance; but when one or two or more of\r\nother kinds are placed between them, you find a sort of ladder which,\r\nin an evident manner, unites the lowest with the highest tribes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: Sir Charles Bell's Treatise on the Hand.]\r\n\r\nAt distant periods of the earth's history, you may see the same sort of\r\norgans, and the same dependance of the creatures one on another. The\r\nfierce Icthyosaurus, and the sly, long-necked Plesiosaurus, had eyes,\r\nears, tongues, and other parts, the same as our contemporaries; and\r\nthey ate and digested their food, and moved from place to place, and\r\npreyed on each other in no other manner.\r\n\r\nIf our acquaintance with nature were much greater than it is, we should\r\ndoubtless be able to bring proofs that there is no sort of stones, of\r\nvegetables, or of animals, nor any process or movement of the elements,\r\nin which we have not an interest. There is no fact that is not in\r\nsome way or other connected with the whole, so as to influence its\r\nwell-being.\r\n\r\nVII. Not only are the creatures which inhabit the earth united together\r\nby bonds of similarity of structure and appetite, of common wants and\r\nenjoyments, and of mutual support; but we are also united with the\r\nboundless system of worlds which the night unveils to our view. The\r\nprinciple of gravitation, and the beneficent rays of the sun operating\r\non the planets and their moons, throw over us a plain and obvious tie\r\nof brotherhood with the stars that we may see night after night making\r\ntheir way amongst the constellations, as they move in their orbits,\r\ndistinguished by their steady light from the twinkling multitude of\r\nfixed stars. The law that unites us to them is the same as causes a\r\ndrop of rain to descend, or a weary fly to settle on the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable, that the aerolites (if the theory which I hinted\r\nat in a former chapter be true) may be fragments of original matter,\r\nwhich have never been appropriated by any globe, and now sometimes\r\npitch on one planet, and sometimes on another. If this be the case, we\r\nshould be warranted in concluding that the matter of our solar system\r\nis everywhere the same, chemically considered, and is, therefore,\r\ngoverned by the same chemical laws; for the aerolites contain no\r\nsubstance which is not to be found far below the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nSome ignorant persons, in all ages of the world, have fancied that the\r\nrelative positions of the stars to each other, at the moment of the\r\nbirth of an individual, must have an influence upon his character and\r\nthe future circumstances of his life. Thus arose what was called the\r\n_science_ of astrology, and the practice of _casting nativities_; and\r\nin vulgar conversation it is not unfrequent for people, who do not\r\nknow the origin of the expression, to \"thank their stars,\" or to talk\r\nof their \"unlucky stars,\" which arose from the prevalence of such a\r\nbelief. This, I need hardly tell you, is all nonsense, from beginning\r\nto end; but you may now know that there is, in reality, quite as\r\nwonderful a connection, and as direct a one, between yourselves and the\r\nstars, as this which was fancied to exist.\r\n\r\nVIII. But who can tell how wide the relationship of our earth and\r\neverything upon it is extended, through the agency of those wonderful\r\nprinciples Light, Heat, and Electricity? It may seem to you impossible,\r\nwhen I tell you that there is not a blade of grass or a flower on\r\nthis earth, which may not, in its little degree, affect the climate\r\nof a star far beyond the limits of our solar system; but if you will\r\nconsider the way in which the falling of dews is regulated, you will\r\nsee that there are grounds for such a notion.\r\n\r\nI must first tell you that it is a property of Heat, like Light, to\r\n_radiate_ or expand itself in all directions, without limit; so that a\r\nheated body is always sending out its heat.\r\n\r\nNow, this radiation is influenced by the surfaces of bodies: Heat will\r\nradiate more from a black rough surface than from a smooth white one,\r\nand a black body will therefore much sooner get cool than a white one,\r\nas I had occasion to tell you just now. The heat radiates rapidly from\r\nthe leaves of vegetables, though from different kinds of plants in very\r\ndifferent degrees, while from stones and dry wood it radiates very\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nHeat is also _reflected_, or turned back, by meeting with certain\r\nobjects; and in this respect, too, it resembles light. You have\r\npossibly seen experiments showing this, made with polished metal\r\nmirrors.\r\n\r\nAt night time, when the sun's rays are not present, as the heat\r\nradiates quickly from the plants on the ground, each plant becomes\r\nthereby cooler than the earth and stones which surround it. This causes\r\nthe watery particles which the air contains, to condense on its leaves\r\nand flowers, in the same manner as you see the moisture in the air of\r\na crowded room, settle on the outside of a glass of cold water; and,\r\nwhat is most wonderful, the surface of each plant is so constructed as\r\nto allow the escape of just so much heat, and to receive just so much\r\ndew in return, as its peculiar nature requires. You may see, if you\r\nlook, that some plants always have more dew on them than others.\r\n\r\nOn a cloudy night, when dews are not so much required, a great part of\r\nthe heat thus radiated is sent back, being reflected by the clouds.\r\nHence the dew falls less heavily at such a time than on a clear\r\nstarlight night, when every blade of grass and every little flower\r\nsends out its ray of heat to an indefinite extent, and may possibly\r\nmeet another ray from the Dog-stars or one of the Pleiades!\r\n\r\nThis is very wonderful; but if you think, you will perceive that it\r\nis not more wonderful than that a ray of light should travel so far.\r\nEvery particle of the surface of these stars does its part in emitting\r\nlight, and by that the light of our nights is increased; and if Light\r\nis affected by such remote influences, why should not Climate be so\r\naffected?\r\n\r\nIX. As everything has a place to fill up amongst the creatures by which\r\nit becomes connected with the universal system, we find innumerable\r\ninstances of things being most wonderfully provided with powers of\r\nretaining the position for which they were created, when circumstances\r\nmay oppose it. The tendency which every animal has to preserve its\r\nown life, supplies abundant illustration. It is this which causes the\r\nArctic animals to change their colour to white in winter, and the\r\nswallows to migrate to warmer regions. But there is something selfish\r\nin this, as the provision is merely to save the animal's own life.\r\nMuch more beautiful is it to observe the operation of the affections\r\nof parent animals towards their offspring, by which the young, when\r\nthey are incapable of taking care of themselves, are kept alive and\r\npreserved from injury often at the sacrifice of the enjoyment, and\r\neven of the life of their parent. You will remember what I told you\r\nrespecting the love of the old whales towards the _suckers_. Nothing\r\nparts with its own life willingly, but in a great many animals it may\r\nbe seen that there is a greater regard to the preservation of their\r\nrace than of their own individual lives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nX. These tendencies may be seen in vegetables as well as in animals.\r\nThe young buds of various plants, of the common poppy for example, hang\r\ndown their heads, so that the bottom of the _calyx_, as it is called by\r\nbotanists, is placed upwards, and forms a sort of thatch or roof. When\r\nthe flower spreads out its bright broad leaves, although its weight\r\nis increased, yet it then boldly lifts up its head to the sun, and\r\nthe neck of the stalk which seemed unable to bear up the bud, is well\r\nable to sustain the full flower. Now if it were otherwise, and if the\r\nbud held the same position as the flower, the rain would run into the\r\ncalyx and would lie there, so as to cause the _petals_ or leaves of the\r\nfuture flower to become rotten.\r\n\r\nIn this Kingdom of Nature, the unwillingness to part with life is even\r\nmore wonderfully exhibited than in animals.\r\n\r\nSeeds have been known to retain their principle of life for centuries,\r\nand long after they have seemed perfectly dead and dry, when placed\r\nin proper circumstances, they have sent out shoots and borne flowers\r\nand fruit. Mr. White relates, that when some old beech trees were\r\nremoved from a spot in the neighbourhood of Selborne, where they must\r\nhave stood for ages, some strawberry plants sprung up, of which the\r\nseeds must have lain dormant under the roots of the beeches. When the\r\nSpaniards took possession of Peru, many of the race of Incas, the\r\nrulers of that country, fled to the deserts and took with them what\r\nprovisions they could carry. There are now, sometimes, found in these\r\ndeserts, ancient vessels with very narrow mouths, containing at the\r\nbottom a few grains of _maize_ or Indian corn, the remains of the stock\r\nof those poor exiles. I have got one of the vessels; and the maize\r\nwhich came out of it was sown, and took root and bore seed, though it\r\nmust have been bottled up for considerably more than three centuries.\r\n\r\nBut now I am going to tell you something still more surprising than\r\nthis. The Ancient Egyptians, from some notion connected with their\r\nreligion, used at times to place in the hands and under the soles of\r\nthe feet of the bodies they embalmed, the roots of a kind of lily. The\r\nroots are of a bulbous sort, not much unlike an onion, and they have\r\noften been found on those mummies which have been uncovered. One or two\r\nof them have been set to vegetate, and have actually borne flowers and\r\nseed, after having slumbered in a mummy coffin for considerably more\r\nthan 2000 years!\r\n\r\nXI. You know that some seeds have wings or sails, by means of which\r\nthey are transported by the winds over land and sea for very many\r\nmiles. The thistle-down everybody is acquainted with. There is an\r\neastern annual plant whose seeds are provided with wings, which, in\r\na most curious manner, it only uses when it needs them, as you shall\r\nhear. It grows in the little pools that occur here and there in the\r\ndeserts of Arabia, which, as you may suppose, in a hot climate and a\r\nsandy soil, are very apt to dry up at some seasons of the year. The\r\nseeds grow on the stalk enclosed in a roll of flaxen fibres, and when\r\nthey are ripe they fall off, and if the water continues till the next\r\nyear, they spring up close by where their parent plant lived. But\r\nshould the pool dry up, the flaxen fibres become dry and spread out\r\ninto wings, the wind takes hold of them, and away flies the seed till\r\nit reaches a more favoured spot. When it is lucky enough to get to the\r\nwater, the pod speedily bursts open, and the seeds take root at the\r\nbottom. You see how, by a simple mechanical contrivance, this plant is\r\nenabled to do the same for the preservation of its species, as I told\r\nyou the Actinia did by a very simple exercise of instinct, for the\r\npreservation of itself.\r\n\r\nXII. Because you wonder at the works of creation, you feel a desire to\r\nsearch into them. You will find out many things, and you may learn to\r\nexplain a great many things, the reasons of which you are ignorant of\r\nat present. Still, your wonder will not be satisfied; on the contrary,\r\nthe further you go, the more it will be excited. You will have to\r\ngo wondering on, but if you proceed in the right disposition, every\r\naddition to your knowledge will increase your admiration and love;\r\nfor everything was made by the loving and wise God, and therefore\r\nthe whole must necessarily be beautiful and harmonious, and there is\r\nnothing which has not its place to fill, and its part to act. May you,\r\nmy little friends, ever keep in mind that you are not left out of this\r\nDivine Plan; and that there is a place to be filled, and duties to\r\nbe performed, by each one of you, which are not left to a mechanical\r\ncontrivance nor to animal instinct; but must be found out and fulfilled\r\nby a never dying Spirit, which must be conscious of what it is about,\r\nand is responsible to God for every action.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ.
