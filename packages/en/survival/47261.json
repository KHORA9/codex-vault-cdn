K. GILBERT,\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.\r\n\r\n    [A] Read to the American Association for the Advancement of\r\n        Science, at New York, June 26, 1900, as the address of the\r\n        retiring President.\r\n\r\n\r\nCustom dictates that in complying with the rule of the association I\r\nshall address you on some subject of a scientific character. But before\r\ndoing so I may be permitted to pay my personal tribute to the honored\r\nand cherished leader of whose loss we are so keenly sensible on this\r\noccasion. His kindly personality, the charm which his earnestness and\r\nsincerity gave to his conversation, the range of his accomplishment,\r\nare inviting themes; but it is perhaps more fitting that I touch\r\nthis evening on his character as a representative president of this\r\nbody. The association holds a peculiar position among our scientific\r\norganizations of national or continental extent. Instead of narrowing\r\nits meetings by limitations of subject matter or membership, it\r\ncultivates the entire field of research and invites the interest and\r\ncoöperation of all. It is thus not only the integrating body for\r\nprofessional investigators, but the bond of union between these and the\r\ngreat group of cultured men and women--the group from whose ranks the\r\nprofessional guild is recruited, through whom the scientific spirit\r\nis chiefly propagated, and through whose interest scientific research\r\nreceives its financial support. Its aims and form of organization\r\nrecognize, what pure science does not always itself recognize, that\r\npure science is fundamentally the creature and servant of the material\r\nneeds of mankind, and it thus stands for what might be called the\r\nhuman side of science. Edward Orton, throughout his career as teacher\r\nand investigator, was conspicuous for his attention to the human side\r\nof science. His most abstract work was consciously for the benefit\r\nof the community, and he ever sought opportunity to make its results\r\ndirectly available. In promoting the interests of the people of his\r\nadopted State he incidentally accomplished much for a larger community\r\nby helping it to an appreciation of the essential beneficence of the\r\nscientific study of nature and man. As an individual he was a diligent\r\nand successful laborer in the field which the association cultivates,\r\nand when the association selected him as its standard-bearer it made\r\nchoice of one who was peculiarly its representative.\r\n\r\nThe subject to which I shall invite your attention this evening is by\r\nno means novel, but might better be called perennial or recurrent; for\r\nthe problem of our earth’s age seems to bear repeated solution without\r\nloss of vigor or prestige. It has been a marked favorite, moreover,\r\nwith presidents and vice-presidents, retiring or otherwise, when called\r\nupon to address assemblies whose fields of scientific interest are\r\nsomewhat diverse--for the reason, I imagine, that while the specialist\r\nclaims the problem as his peculiar theme of study, he feels that other\r\ndenizens of the planet in question may not lack interest in the early\r\nlore of their estate.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of the problem inheres in the fact that it not only\r\ntranscends direct observation, but demands the extrapolation or\r\nextension of familiar physical laws and processes far beyond the\r\nordinary range of qualifying conditions. From whatever side it is\r\napproached, the way must be paved by postulates, and the resulting\r\nviews are so discrepant that impartial onlookers have come to be\r\nsuspicious of these convenient and inviting stepping stones.\r\n\r\nThat vain expectation may not be aroused, I admit at the outset that\r\nI have not solved the problem and shall submit to you no estimates.\r\nMy immediate interest is in the preliminary question of the available\r\nmethods of approach, and it leads to the consideration of the ways,\r\nor the classes of ways, in which the measurement of time has been\r\naccomplished or attempted.\r\n\r\nOf the artificial devices employed in practical horology there are two\r\nso venerable that their origins are lost in the obscurity of legendary\r\nmyth. These are the clepsydra and the taper. In the clepsydra advantage\r\nis taken of the approximately uniform rate at which water escapes\r\nthrough a small orifice, and time is measured by gaging the loss of\r\nwater from a discharging vessel or the gain in a receiving vessel.\r\nThe hour-glass is one of its latest forms, in which sand takes the\r\nplace of water. The taper depends for its value as a timepiece on the\r\napproximate uniformity of combustion when the area of fuel exposed to\r\nthe air is definitely regulated. It survives chiefly in the prayer\r\nstick and safety fuse, but the graduated candle is perhaps still used\r\nto regulate monastic vigils.\r\n\r\nThe pendulum, a comparatively modern invention, excelling the clepsydra\r\nand taper in precision, has altogether supplanted them as the servant\r\nof civilization. Its accuracy results from the remarkable property\r\nthat the period in which it completes an oscillation is almost exactly\r\nthe same, whatever the arc through which it swings. It regulates the\r\nmovements not only of our clocks, watches and chronometers, but of\r\nbarographs, thermographs and a great variety of other machines for\r\nrecording events and changes in their proper order and relation in\r\nrespect to time.\r\n\r\nI must mention also a special apparatus invented by astronomers and\r\ncalled a chronograph. It consists ordinarily of a revolving drum about\r\nwhich a paper is wrapped and against which rests a pen. As the drum\r\nturns the pen draws a line on the paper. Through an electric circuit\r\nthe pen is brought under the influence of a pendulum in such a way\r\nthat at the middle of each swing of the pendulum the pen is deflected,\r\nmaking a mark at right angles to the straight line. The series of\r\nmarks thus drawn constitutes a time scale. The electric arrangements\r\nare so made that the pen will also be disturbed in consequence of\r\nsome independent event, such as the firing of a gun or the transit of\r\na star; and the mark caused by such disturbance, being automatically\r\nplatted on the time scale, records the time of the event.\r\n\r\nNo attempt has been made to characterize these various timepieces with\r\nfullness, because they are already well known to most of those present,\r\nand, in fact, the chief motive for giving them separate mention is that\r\nthey may serve as the basis of a classification. In the use of the\r\nclepsydra and taper, time is measured in terms of a continuous movement\r\nor process; in the use of the pendulum time is measured in terms of a\r\nmovement which is periodically reversed. The classification embodies\r\nthe fundamental distinction between continuous motion and rhythmic\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nPassing now from the artificial to the natural measures of time, we\r\nfind that they are all rhythmic. It is true that the spinning of the\r\nearth on its axis is in itself a continuous motion, but it would\r\nyield no time measure if the earth were alone in space, and so soon\r\nas the motion is considered in relation to some other celestial body\r\nit becomes rhythmic. As viewed from, or compared with, a fixed star,\r\nthe period of its rhythm is the sidereal day; compared with the sun,\r\nit is the solar day, nearly four minutes longer; and compared with\r\nthe moon, it is the lunar day, still longer by 49 minutes. As the\r\nsun supplies the energy for most of the physical and all the vital\r\nprocesses of the earth’s surface, the rhythm of the solar day is\r\nimpressed in multitudinous ways on man and his environment, and he\r\nmakes it his primary or standard unit of time. He has arbitrarily\r\ndivided it into hours, minutes and seconds, and in terms of these units\r\nhe says that the length of the sidereal day is a little more than 23\r\nhours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds, and the average length of the lunar\r\nday is a little less than 24 hours and 49 minutes. The lunar day finds\r\nexpression in the tides and is of moment to maritime folk, but the\r\nsidereal is known only to astronomers.\r\n\r\nNext in the series of our natural time units is the month, or the\r\nrhythmic period of the moon regarded as a luminary. By our savage\r\nancestors, who credited the moon with powers of great importance\r\nto themselves, much use was made of this unit, but as progress in\r\nknowledge has shown that the influence of the satellite had been vastly\r\noverrated, less and less attention has been paid to the returning\r\ncrescent, and it is only in ecclesiastic calendars that the chronology\r\nof civilization now recognizes the natural month. Its shadow survives,\r\nwithout the substance, in the calendar month; and the week possibly\r\nrepresents an early attempt to subdivide it.\r\n\r\nIn passing to our third natural unit, the year, we again encounter\r\nsolar influence, and find the rhythm of the earth’s orbit echoed and\r\nreechoed in innumerable physical and vital vibrations. As the attitude\r\nof the earth’s axis inclines one hemisphere toward the sun for part\r\nof the year and the other hemisphere for the remainder, the whole\r\ncomplex drama of climate is annually enacted, and the sequence of man’s\r\nactivities is made to assume an annual rhythm. The year is second only\r\nto the day as a terrestrial unit of duration; and as the day is man’s\r\nstandard for the minute division of time, so the year is his standard\r\nfor larger divisions, and the decade, the century and the millenium are\r\nits multiples.\r\n\r\nBut the rhythms of day and night, of summer and winter, are not\r\nthe only tides in the affairs of men. At birth we are small, weak\r\nand dependent, we grow larger and stronger, we become mature and\r\nindependent, and then by reproducing our kind we complete the cycle,\r\nwhich begins again with our children. The cycle of human life is the\r\n_generation_, a time unit of somewhat indefinite length and varying\r\nin phase from family to family, but holding a place, nevertheless, in\r\nhuman chronology.\r\n\r\nStill less definite is the rhythm of hereditary rulership, progressing\r\nfrom vigor through luxury to degeneracy, and closing its cycle in\r\nusurpation; yet it makes an epoch in the life of a nation or empire,\r\nand so the _dynasty_ is one of the units of the historian.\r\n\r\nThe generation and the dynasty are of waning importance in human\r\nchronology, and they can claim no connection with the problem of\r\ngeologic time; but here again I have turned aside for a moment in order\r\nto illustrate a principle of classification. The daily rhythm of waking\r\nand sleeping, of activity and rest, does not originate with man, but is\r\nimposed on him by the rhythm of light and darkness, and that in turn\r\nsprings from the turning of the earth in relation to the shining sun.\r\nThe yearly rhythm of sowing and harvesting, of the fan and the furnace,\r\ndoes not originate with man, but is imposed on him by the rhythm of the\r\nseasons, and that in turn springs from certain motions of the earth in\r\nrelation to the glowing sun. But the rhythm of the generation and the\r\nrhythm of the dynasty have origin in the nature of man himself. The\r\nrhythms of human chronology may thus be grouped according to source in\r\ntwo classes, the _imposed_ and the _original_; and the same distinction\r\nholds for other rhythms. The lunar day is an original rhythm of the\r\nearth as seen from the moon; the ground swell is an original rhythm\r\nof the ocean; but the tide is an imposed rhythm of the ocean, being\r\nderived from the lunar day. The swing of the pendulum is an original\r\nrhythm, but the regular excursion of the chronograph pen, being caused\r\nby the swing of the pendulum, is an imposed rhythm.\r\n\r\nIn giving brief consideration to each of the more important ways by\r\nwhich the problem of the earth’s age has been approached, I shall\r\nmention first those which follow the action of some continuous process,\r\nand afterward those which depend on the recognition of rhythms.\r\n\r\nThe earliest computations of geologic time, as well as the majority of\r\nall such computations, have followed the line of the most familiar and\r\nfundamental of geologic processes. All through the ages the rains, the\r\nrivers and the waves have been eating away the land, and the product\r\nof their gnawing has been received by the sea and spread out in layers\r\nof sediment. These layers have been hardened into rocky strata, and\r\nfrom time to time portions have been upraised and made part of the\r\nland. The record they contain makes the chief part of geologic history,\r\nand the groups into which they are divided correspond to the ages and\r\nperiods of that history. In order to make use of these old sediments\r\nas measures of time it is necessary to know either their thickness\r\nor their volume, and also the rate at which they were laid down. As\r\nthe actual process of sedimentation is concealed from view, advantage\r\nis taken of the fact that the whole quantity deposited in a year is\r\nexactly equalled by the whole quantity washed from the land in the same\r\ntime, and measurements and estimates are made of the amounts brought to\r\nthe sea by rivers and torn from the cliffs of the shore by waves. After\r\nan estimate has been obtained of the total annual sedimentation at the\r\npresent time, it is necessary to assume either that the average rate in\r\npast ages has been the same or that it has differed in some definite\r\nway.\r\n\r\nAt this point the course of procedure divides. The computer may\r\nconsider the aggregate amount of the sedimentary rocks, irrespective\r\nof their subdivisions, or he may consider the thicknesses of the\r\nvarious groups as exhibited in different localities. If he views the\r\nrocks collectively, as a total to be divided by the annual increment,\r\nhis estimate of the total is founded primarily on direct measurements\r\nmade at many places on the continents, but to the result of such\r\nmeasurements he must add a postulated amount for the rocks concealed\r\nby the ocean, and another postulated amount for the material which has\r\nbeen eroded from the land and deposited in the sea more than once.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, he views each group of rocks by itself, and\r\ntakes account of its thickness at some locality where it is well\r\ndisplayed, he must acquire in some way definite conceptions of the\r\nrates at which its component layers of sand, clay and limy mud were\r\naccumulated, or else he must postulate that its average rate of\r\naccretion bore some definite ratio to the present average rate of\r\nsedimentation for the whole ocean. This course is, on the whole, more\r\ndifficult than the other, but it has yielded certain preliminary\r\nfactors in which considerable confidence is felt. Whatever may have\r\nbeen the absolute rate of rock building in each locality, it is\r\nbelieved that a group of strata which exhibits great thickness in many\r\nplaces must represent more time than a group of similar strata which is\r\neverywhere thin, and that clays and marls, settling in quiet waters,\r\nare likely to represent, foot for foot, greater amounts of time than\r\nthe coarser sediments gathered by strong currents; and studying the\r\nformations with regard to both thickness and texture, geologists have\r\nmade out what are called _time ratios_--series of numbers expressing\r\nthe relative lengths of the different ages, periods and epochs. Such\r\nestimates of ratios, when made by different persons, are found to vary\r\nmuch less than do the estimates of absolute time, and they will serve\r\nan excellent purpose whenever a satisfactory determination shall have\r\nbeen made of the duration of any one period.\r\n\r\nReade has varied the sedimentary method by restricting attention to the\r\nlimestones, which have the peculiarity that their material is carried\r\nfrom the land in solution; and it is a point in favor of this procedure\r\nthat the dissolved burdens of rivers are more easily measured than\r\ntheir burdens of clay and sand.\r\n\r\nAn independent system of time ratios has been founded on the principle\r\nof the evolution of life. Not all formations are equally supplied with\r\nfossils, but some of them contain voluminous records of contemporary\r\nlife; and when account is taken of the amount of change from each full\r\nrecord to the next, the steps of the series are found to be of unequal\r\nmagnitude. Though there is no method of precisely measuring the steps,\r\neven in a comparative way, it has yet been found possible to make\r\napproximate estimates, and these in the main lend support to the time\r\nratios founded on sedimentation. They bring aid also at a point where\r\nthe sedimentary data are weak, for the earliest formations are hard to\r\nclassify and measure. It is true that these same formations are almost\r\nbarren of fossils, but biologic inference does not therefore stop. The\r\noldest known fauna, the Eocambrian, does not represent the beginnings\r\nof life, but a well-advanced stage, characterized by development along\r\nmany divergent lines; and by comparing Eocambrian life with existing\r\nlife the paleontologist is able to make an estimate of the relative\r\nprogress in evolution before and after the Eocambrian epoch. The only\r\nabsolute blank left by the time ratios pertains to an azoic age which\r\nmay have intervened between the development of a habitable earth crust\r\nand the actual beginning of life.\r\n\r\nErosion and deposition have been used also, in a variety of ways,\r\nto compute the length of very recent geologic epochs. Thus, from\r\nthe accumulation of sand in beaches Andrews estimated the age of\r\nLake Michigan, and Upham the age of the glacial lake Agassiz; and\r\nfrom the erosion of the Niagara gorge the age of the river flowing\r\nthrough it has been estimated. But while these discussions have\r\nyielded conceptions of the nature of geologic time, and have served to\r\nillustrate the extreme complexity of the conditions which affect its\r\nmeasurement, they have accomplished little toward the determination\r\nof the length of a geologic period; for they have pertained only to a\r\nsmall fraction of what geologists call a period, and that fraction was\r\nof a somewhat abnormal character.\r\n\r\nWholly independent avenues of approach are opened by the study of\r\nprocesses pertaining to the earth as a planet, and with these the name\r\nof Kelvin is prominently associated.\r\n\r\nAs the rotation of the earth causes the tides, and as the tides expend\r\nenergy, the tides must act as a brake, checking the speed of rotation.\r\nTherefore the earth has in the past spun faster than now, and its rate\r\nof spinning at any remote point of time may be computed. Assuming that\r\nthe whole globe is solid and rigid, and that the geologic record could\r\nnot begin until that condition had been attained, there could not have\r\nbeen great checking of rotation since consolidation. For if there had\r\nbeen, it would have resulted in the gathering of the oceans about the\r\npoles and the baring of the land near the equator, a condition very\r\ndifferent from what actually obtains. This line of reasoning yields an\r\nobscure outer limit to the age of the earth.\r\n\r\nOn the assumption that the globe lacks something of perfect rigidity,\r\nG. H. Darwin has traced back the history of the earth and the moon to\r\nan epoch when the two bodies were united, their separation having been\r\nfollowed by the gradual enlargement of the moon’s orbit and the gradual\r\nretardation of the earth’s rotation; and this line of inquiry has also\r\nyielded an obscure outer limit to the antiquity of the earth as a\r\nhabitable globe.\r\n\r\nOne of the most elaborate of all the computations starts with the\r\nassumption that at an initial epoch, when the outer part of the earth\r\nwas consolidated from a liquid condition, the whole body of the planet\r\nhad approximately the same temperature; and that as the surface\r\nafterward cooled by outward radiation there was a flow of heat to the\r\nsurface by conduction from below. The rate of this flow has diminished\r\nfrom that epoch to the present time according to a definite law, and\r\nthe present rate, being known from observation, affords a measure of\r\nthe age of the crust. The strength of this computation lies in its\r\ndefiniteness and the simplicity of its data; its weakness in the fact\r\nthat it postulates a knowledge of certain properties of rock--namely,\r\nits fusibility, conductivity and viscosity--when subjected to pressures\r\nand temperatures far greater than have ever been investigated\r\nexperimentally.\r\n\r\nA parallel line of discussion pertains to the sun. Great as is the\r\nquantity of heat which that incandescent globe yields to the earth, it\r\nis but a minute fraction of the whole amount with which it continually\r\nparts, for its radiation is equal in all directions, and the earth is\r\nbut a speck in the solar sky. On the assumption that this immense loss\r\nof heat is accompanied by a corresponding loss of volume, the sun is\r\nshrinking at a definite rate, and a computation based on this rate has\r\ntold how many millions of years ago the sun’s diameter should have been\r\nequal to the present diameter of the earth’s orbit. Manifestly the\r\nearth can not have been ready for habitation before the passage of that\r\nepoch, and so the computation yields a superior limit to the extent of\r\ngeologic time.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to the next division of the subject--the computations\r\nbased on rhythms--a few words may be given to the results which have\r\nbeen obtained from the study of continuous processes. Realizing that\r\nyour patience may have been strained by the kaleidoscopic character of\r\nthe rapid review which has seemed unavoidable, I shall spare you the\r\nrecitation of numerical details and merely state in general terms that\r\nthe geologists, or those who have reasoned from the rocks and fossils,\r\nhave deduced values for the earth’s age very much larger than have\r\nbeen obtained by the physicists, or those who have reasoned from earth\r\ncooling, sun cooling and tidal friction. In order to express their\r\nresults in millions of years the geologists must employ from three\r\nto five digits, while the physicists need but one or two. When these\r\nenormous discrepancies were first realized it was seen that serious\r\nerrors must exist in some of the observational data or else in some of\r\nthe theories employed; and geologists undertook with zeal the revision\r\nof their computations, making as earnest an effort for reconciliation\r\nas had been made a generation earlier to adjust the elements of the\r\nHebrew cosmogony to the facts of geology. But after rediscussing the\r\nmeasurements and readjusting the assumptions so as to reduce the time\r\nestimates in every reasonable way--and perhaps in some that were not so\r\nreasonable--they were still unable to compress the chapters of geologic\r\nhistory between the narrow covers of physical limitation; and there\r\nthe matter rests for the present.\r\n\r\nThe rocks which were formed as sediments show many traces of rhythm.\r\nSome are composed of layers, thin as paper, which alternate in color,\r\nso that when broken across they exhibit delicate banding. In the time\r\nof their making there was a periodic change in the character of the mud\r\nthat settled from the water. Others are banded on a larger scale; and\r\nthere are also bandings of texture where the color is uniform. Many\r\nformations are divided into separate strata, as though the process of\r\naccretion had been periodically interrupted. Series of hard strata are\r\noften separated by films or thin layers of softer material. Strata of\r\ntwo kinds are sometimes seen to alternate through many repetitions.\r\nBorings in the delta of the Mississippi show soils and remains of trees\r\nat many levels, alternating with river silts. The rock series in which\r\ncoal occurs are monotonous repetitions of shale and sandstone. Belgian\r\ngeologists have been so impressed by the recurrence of short sequences\r\nof strata that they have based an elaborate system of rock notation\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nPassing to still greater units, the large aggregates of strata\r\nsometimes called systems show in many cases a regular sequence, which\r\nNewberry called a “circle of deposition.” When complete, it comprises\r\na sandstone or conglomerate, at base, then shale, limestone, shale and\r\nsandstone. This sequence is explained as the result of the gradual\r\nencroachment, or transgression, as it is called, of the sea over the\r\nland and its subsequent recession.\r\n\r\nIn certain bogs of Scandinavia deep accumulations of peat are traversed\r\nhorizontally by layers including tree stumps in such way as to indicate\r\nthat the ground has been alternately covered by forest and boggy\r\nmoss. The broad glaciers of the Ice age grew alternately smaller\r\nand larger--or else were repeatedly dissipated and reformed--and\r\ntheir final waning was characterized by a series of halts or partial\r\nreadvances, recorded in concentric belts of ice-brought drift. Of these\r\nbelts, called moraines of recession, Taylor enumerates seventeen in a\r\nsingle system.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of these and other repetitive series incorporated in the\r\nstructure of the earth’s crust, a variety of rhythmic causes have been\r\nadduced; and mention will be made of the more important, beginning with\r\nthose which have the character of original rhythms.\r\n\r\nA river flowing through its delta clogs its channel with sediment,\r\nand from time to time shifts its course to a new line, reaching the\r\nsea by a new mouth. Such changes interrupt and vary sedimentation in\r\nneighboring parts of the sea. Storms of rain make floods, and each\r\nflood may cause a separate stratum of sediment. Storms of wind give\r\ndestructive force to the waves that beat the shore, and each storm\r\nmay cause the deposit of an individual layer of sediment. Varying\r\nwinds may drive currents this way and that, causing alternations in\r\nsedimentation.\r\n\r\nTo explain the forest beds buried in the Mississippi silts it has\r\nbeen suggested that the soft deposits of the delta from time to time\r\nsettled and spread out under their own weight. Various alternations of\r\nstrata, and especially those of the coal measures, have been ascribed\r\nto successive local subsidences of the earth’s crust, caused by the\r\naddition of loads of deposit. It has been suggested also that land\r\nundergoing erosion may rise up from time to time because relieved\r\nof load, and the character of sediment might be changed by such\r\nrising. Subterranean forces, of whatever origin, seemingly slumber\r\nwhile strains are accumulating, and then become suddenly manifest in\r\ndislocations and eruptions, and such catastrophes affect sedimentation.\r\n\r\nA more general rhythm has been ascribed to the tidal retardation of\r\nrotation and the resulting change of the earth’s form. If the body\r\nof the earth has a rather high rigidity, we should expect that it\r\nwould for a time resist the tendency to become more nearly spherical,\r\nwhile the water of the ocean would accommodate itself to the changing\r\nconditions of equilibrium by seeking the higher latitudes. Eventually,\r\nhowever, the solid earth would yield to the strain and its figure\r\nbecome adjusted to the slower rotation, and then the mobile water\r\nwould return. Thus would be caused periodic transgressions by the sea,\r\noccurring alternately in high and low latitudes.\r\n\r\nAnother general rhythm has been recently suggested by Chamberlin in\r\nconnection with the hypothesis that secular variations of climate are\r\nchiefly due to variations of the quantity of carbon dioxide in the\r\natmosphere.[B] The system of interdependent factors he works out is too\r\ncomplex for presentation at this time, and I must content myself with\r\nsaying that his explanation of the moraines of recession involves the\r\ninteraction of a peculiar atmospheric condition with a condition of\r\nglaciation, each condition tending to aggravate the other, until the\r\ncumulative results brought about a reaction and the climatic pendulum\r\nswung in the opposite direction. With each successive oscillation the\r\nmomentum was less, and an equilibrium was finally reached.\r\n\r\n    [B] An attempt to frame a working hypothesis of the cause of\r\n        glacial periods on an atmospheric basis. _Journ. Geol._,\r\n        Vol. VII., 1899.\r\n\r\nFew of these original rhythms have been used in computations of\r\ngeologic time, and it is not believed that they have any positive\r\nvalue for that purpose. Nevertheless, account must be taken of them,\r\nbecause they compete with imposed rhythms for the explanation of\r\nmany phenomena, and the imposed rhythms, wherever established, yield\r\nestimates of time.\r\n\r\nThe tidal period, or the half of the lunar day, is the shortest\r\nimposed rhythm appealed to in the explanation of the features of\r\nsedimentation. It is quite conceivable that the bottom of a quiet\r\nbay may receive at each tide a thin deposit of mud which could be\r\ndistinguished in the resulting rock as a papery layer or lamina. If one\r\ncould in some way identify a rock thus formed, he might learn how many\r\nhalf-days its making required by counting its laminæ, just as the years\r\nof a tree’s age are learned by counting its rings of growth.\r\n\r\nThe next imposed rhythm of geologic importance is the year. There are\r\nrivers, like the Nile, having but one notable flood in each year,\r\nand so depositing annual layers of sediment on their alluvial plains\r\nand on the sea beds near their mouths. Where oceanic currents are\r\nannually reversed by monsoons, sedimentation may be regularly varied,\r\nor interrupted, once a year. Streams from a glacier cease to run in\r\nwinter, and this annual interruption may give a definite structure to\r\nresulting deposits. It is therefore probable that some of the laminæ\r\nor strata of rocks represent years, but the circumstances are rarely\r\nsuch that the investigator can bar out the possibility that part of\r\nthe markings or separations were caused by original rhythms of unknown\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe number of rhythms existing in the solar system is very large, but\r\nthere are only two, in addition to the two just mentioned, which seem\r\ncompetent to write themselves in a legible way in the geologic record.\r\nThese are the rhythms of precession and eccentricity.\r\n\r\nBecause the earth’s orbit is not quite circular and the sun’s position\r\nis a little out of the center, or eccentric, the two hemispheres into\r\nwhich the earth is divided by the equator do not receive their heat\r\nin the same way. The northern summer, or the period during which\r\nthe northern hemisphere is inclined toward the sun, occurs when the\r\nearth is farthest from the sun, and the northern winter occurs when\r\nthe earth is nearest to the sun, or in that part of the orbit called\r\nperihelion. These relations are exactly reversed for the southern\r\nhemisphere. The general effect of this is that the southern summer is\r\nhotter than the northern, and the southern winter is colder than the\r\nnorthern. In the southern part of the planet there is more contrast\r\nbetween summer and winter than in the northern. The sun sends to each\r\nhalf the same total quantity of heat in the course of a year, but the\r\ndifference in distribution makes the climates different. The physics of\r\nthe atmosphere is so intricate a subject that meteorologists are not\r\nfully agreed as to the theoretic consequences of these differences of\r\nsolar heating, but it is generally believed that they are important,\r\ninvolving differences in the force of the winds, in the velocity and\r\ncourse of ocean currents, in vegetation, and in the extent of glaciers.\r\n\r\nNow, the point of interest in the present connection is that the\r\nastronomic relations which occasion these peculiarities are not\r\nconstant, but undergo a slow periodic change. The relation of the\r\nseasons to the orbit is gradually shifting, so that each season in\r\nturn coincides with the perihelion; and the climatic peculiarities\r\nof the two hemispheres, so far as they depend on planetary motions,\r\nare periodically reversed. The time in which the cycle of change is\r\ncompleted, or the period of the rhythm, is not always the same, but\r\naverages 21,000 years. It is commonly called the precessional period.[C]\r\n\r\n    [C] Strictly speaking, 21,000 years is the period of the\r\n        precession of the equinoxes as referred to perihelion; but\r\n        the perihelion is itself in motion. As referred to a fixed\r\n        star the precession of the equinoxes has an average period\r\n        of about 25,700 years.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the climates of many parts of the earth are subject\r\nto a secular cycle, with contrasted phases every 10,500 years, we\r\nshould expect to find records of the cycle in the sediments. A moist\r\nclimate would tend to leach the calcareous matter from the rock,\r\nleaving an earthy soil behind, and in a succeeding drier climate the\r\nsoil would be carried away; and thus the adjacent ocean would receive\r\nfirst calcareous and then earthy sediments. The increase of glaciers\r\nin one hemisphere would not only modify adjacent sediments directly,\r\nbut, by adding matter on that side, would make a small difference in\r\nthe position of the earth’s center of gravity. The ocean would move\r\nsomewhat toward the weighted hemisphere, encroaching on some coasts\r\nand drawing down on others; and even a small change of that sort would\r\nmodify the conditions of erosion and deposition to an appreciable\r\nextent in many localities.\r\n\r\nBlytt ascribed to this astronomic cause the alternations of bog and\r\nforest in Scandinavia, as well as other sedimentary rhythms observed\r\nin Europe; and it has seemed to me competent to account for certain\r\nalternations of strata in the Cretaceous formations of Colorado. Croll\r\nused it to explain interglacial epochs, and Taylor has recently applied\r\nit to the moraines of recession.\r\n\r\nThe remaining astronomic rhythm of geologic import is the variation of\r\neccentricity. At the present time our greatest distance from the sun\r\nexceeds our least distance by its thirtieth part, but the difference\r\nis not usually so small as this. It may increase to the seventh part\r\nof the whole distance, and it may fall to zero. Between these limits\r\nit fluctuates in a somewhat irregular way, in which the property of\r\nperiodicity is not conspicuous. The effect of its fluctuation is\r\ninseparable from the precessional effect, and is related to it as a\r\nmodifying condition. When the eccentricity is large the precessional\r\nrhythm is emphasized; when it is small the precessional effect is weak.\r\n\r\nThe variation of eccentricity is connected with the most celebrated\r\nof all attempts to determine a limited portion of geologic time. In\r\nthe elaboration of the theory of the Ice age which bears his name,\r\nCroll correlated two important epochs of glaciation with epochs of\r\nhigh eccentricity computed to have occurred about 100,000 and 210,000\r\nyears ago. As the analysis of the glacial history progresses, these\r\ncorrelations will eventually be established or disproved, and should\r\nthey be established it is possible that similar correlations may be\r\nmade between events far more remote.\r\n\r\nThe studies of these several rhythms, while they have led to the\r\ncomputation of various epochs and stages of geologic time, have not yet\r\nfurnished an estimate either of the entire age of the earth or of any\r\nlarge part of it. Nevertheless, I believe that they may profitably be\r\nfollowed with that end in view.\r\n\r\nThe system of rock layers, great and small, constituting the record\r\nof sedimentation, may be compared to the scroll of a chronograph. The\r\ngeologic scroll bears many separate lines, one for each district where\r\nrocks are well displayed, but these are not independent, for they are\r\nlabeled by fossils, and by means of these labels can be arranged in\r\nproper relation. In each time line are little jogs--changes in kind\r\nof rock or breaks in continuity--and these jogs record contemporary\r\nevents. A new mountain was uplifted, perhaps, on the neighboring\r\ncontinent, or an old uplift received a new impulse. Through what Davis\r\ncalls stream piracy a river gained or lost the drainage of a tract of\r\ncountry. Escaping lava threw a dam across the course of a stream, or\r\nsome Krakatoa strewed ashes over the land and gave the rivers a new\r\nmaterial to work on. The jogs may be faint or strong, many or few, and\r\nfor long distances the lines may run smooth and straight; but so long\r\nas the jogs are irregular they give no clue to time. Here and there,\r\nhowever, the even line will betray a regularly recurring indentation or\r\nundulation, reflecting a rhythm and possibly significant of a remote\r\npendulum whose rate of vibration is known. If it can be traced to such\r\na pendulum there will result a determination of the rate at which the\r\nchronograph scroll moved when that part of the record was made; and\r\na moderate number of such determinations, if well distributed, will\r\nconvert the whole scroll into a definite time scale.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if a sufficient number of the rhythms embodied in\r\nstrata can be identified with particular imposed rhythms, the rates\r\nof sedimentation under different circumstances and at different times\r\nwill become known, and eventually so many parts of geologic time will\r\nhave become subject to direct calculation that the intervals can be\r\nrationally bridged over by the aid of time ratios.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose there is only one of the imposed rhythms of practical\r\nvalue, namely, the precessional; but that one is, in my judgment, of\r\nhigh value. The tidal rhythm can not be expected to characterize any\r\nthick formation. The annual is liable to confusion with a variety of\r\noriginal rhythms, especially those connected with storms. The rhythm\r\nof eccentricity, being theoretically expressed only as an accentuation\r\nof the precessional, can not ordinarily be distinguished from it. But\r\nnone of these qualifications apply to the precessional. It is not\r\nliable to confusion with the tidal and annual because its period is\r\nso much longer, being more than 2,000 times that of the annual. It has\r\nan eminently practical and convenient magnitude, in that its physical\r\nmanifestation is well above the microscopic plane, and yet not so large\r\nas to prevent the frequent bringing of several examples into a single\r\nview. It is also practically regular in period, rarely deviating from\r\nthe average length by more than the tenth part.\r\n\r\nFrom the greater number of original rhythms it is distinguished, just\r\nas from the annual and tidal, by magnitude. The practical geologist\r\nwould never confuse the deposit occasioned by a single storm, for\r\nexample, with the sediments accumulated during an astronomic cycle\r\nof 20,000 years. But there are other original rhythms, known or\r\nsurmised, which might have magnitudes of the same general order, and\r\nto discriminate the precessional from these it is necessary to employ\r\nother characters. Such characters are found in its regularity or\r\nevenness of period, and in its practical perpetuity. The diversion of\r\nthe mouth of a great river such as the Hoang Ho or the Mississippi\r\nmight recur only after long intervals; but from what we know of the\r\nbehavior of smaller streams we may be sure that such events would be\r\nvery irregular in time as well as in other ways. The intervals between\r\nvolcanic eruptions at a particular vent or in a particular district\r\nmay at times amount to thousands of years, but their irregularity is\r\na characteristic feature. The same is true of the recurrent uplifts\r\nby which mountains grow, so far as we may judge them by the related\r\nphenomena of earthquakes; and the same category would seem to hold also\r\nthe theoretically recurrent collapse of the globe under the strains\r\narising from the slowing of rotation. The carbon-dioxide rhythm,\r\nknown as yet only in the field of hypothesis, is hypothetically a\r\nrunning-down oscillation, like the lessening sway of the cradle when\r\nthe push is no longer given.\r\n\r\nBut the precessional motion pulses steadily on through the ages, like\r\nthe swing of a frictionless pendulum. Its throb may or may not be\r\ncaught by the geologic process which obtains in a particular province\r\nand in a particular era, but whenever the conditions are favorable and\r\nthe connection is made, the record should reflect the persistence and\r\nthe regularity of the inciting rhythm.\r\n\r\nThe search of the rocks for records of the ticks of the precessional\r\nclock is an out-of-door work. Pursued as a closet study it could have\r\nno satisfactory outcome, because the printed descriptions of rock\r\nsequences are not sufficiently complete for the purpose; and the closet\r\nstudy of geology is peculiarly exposed to the perils of hobby-riding.\r\nA student of the time problem cannot be sure of a persistent, equable\r\nsedimentary rhythm without direct observation of the characters of\r\nthe repeated layers. He needs to avail himself of every opportunity\r\nto study the series in its horizontal extent, and he should view the\r\nlocal problem of original _versus_ imposed rhythm with the aid of\r\nall the light which the field evidence can cast on the conditions of\r\nsedimentation.\r\n\r\nNeither do I think of rhythm seeking as a pursuit to absorb the\r\nwhole time and energy of an individual and be followed steadily to a\r\nconclusion; but hope rather that it may receive the incidental and\r\noccasional attention of many of my colleagues of the hammer, as other\r\nerrands lead them among cliffs of bedded rocks. If my suggestion\r\nshould succeed in adding a working hypothesis or point of view to the\r\nequipment of field geologists, I should feel that the search had been\r\nbegun in the most promising and advantageous manner. For not only\r\nwould the subject of rhythms and their interpretations be advanced by\r\nreactions from multifarious individual experiences, but the stimulus of\r\nanother hypothesis would lead to the discovery of unexpected meanings\r\nin stratigraphic detail.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the fortunate qualities of scientific research that its\r\nincidental and unanticipated results are not infrequently of equal or\r\neven greater value than those directly sought. Indeed, if it were not\r\nso, there would be no utilitarian harvest from the cultivation of the\r\nfield of pure science.\r\n\r\nIn advocating the adoption of a new point of view from which to peer\r\ninto the mysterious past, I would not be understood to advise the\r\nabandonment of old stand-points, but rather to emulate the surveyor,\r\nwho makes measurement to inaccessible points by means of bearings from\r\ndifferent sides. Every independent bearing on the earth’s beginning is\r\na check on other bearings, and it is through the study of discrepancies\r\nthat we are to discover the refractions by which our lines of sight are\r\nwarped and twisted. The three principal lines we have now projected\r\ninto the abyss of time miss one another altogether, so that there is no\r\npoint of intersection. If any one of them is straight, both the others\r\nare hopelessly crooked. If we would succeed we should not only take new\r\nbearings from each discovered point of vantage, but strive in every\r\nway to discover the sources of error in the bearings we have already\r\nattempted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHOTOGRAPHY OF SOUND WAVES.\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR R. W. WOOD,\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny one who has stood near a large naval gun during its discharge,\r\nwill, I think, be prepared to admit that the sound of the explosion\r\naffects not only the ears, but the whole body as well, which\r\nexperiences something not unlike a sudden blow. This blow, or\r\nconcussion, as it is generally termed, is merely the impact of the wave\r\nof compressed air, spreading out in all directions around the gun. In\r\nthe case of ordinary sounds, the compression of the air in the wave is\r\nso slight that only the delicate auditory nerves respond to the impact,\r\nhence we naturally conclude that sounds are perceived only by the ear.\r\nWhen dealing with sounds of very great intensity, this notion must be\r\nsomewhat modified, for they certainly can be felt as well as heard. In\r\nsome extreme cases, in fact, the sensation of feeling may be stronger\r\nthan that of hearing, as in the case of which I shall speak presently.\r\nIs it also possible that we can perceive sound through the medium of\r\nany other sense organ, say the eye? ‘To see a noise’ certainly sounds\r\nlike an absurdity; yet under certain conditions, sound waves in air\r\ncan be made as distinctly visible as the ripples on a pond surrounding\r\nthe splash of a stone. That they are not seen under ordinary\r\nconditions does not justify us in assuming them to be invisible. We\r\nall know that the currents of hot air rising from a stove, while not\r\nusually conspicuous, can be made visible by properly regulating the\r\nillumination, as by looking along the surface of the stove towards a\r\nwindow. The hot air is visible because in its optical properties it is\r\ndifferent from the cold air surrounding it. The rays of light, passing\r\nthrough the unequally heated portions of the air, are bent in different\r\ndirections, causing a distortion of objects seen through the heated\r\ncurrents. What we see, strictly speaking, is not the hot air itself,\r\nbut a wavering and swimming of the objects seen through it. Yet I think\r\nwe are justified in saying that the eye perceives the hot air.\r\n\r\nNow sound waves in air, which are merely regions where the air is\r\nsomewhat compressed, differ in their optical properties from the\r\nuncompressed portions, just as the hot air differs from the cold.\r\nAs the pictures illustrating this article testify, they may be seen\r\nand photographed under proper conditions of illumination as readily\r\nas solid objects. We must remember, in the first place, that a sound\r\nwave travels with a velocity something greater than a thousand feet a\r\nsecond, rather less than the speed of a modern rifle ball, yet ten\r\ntimes faster than the fastest express train. The wave, even if it were\r\nstationary, could be seen only by adjusting the illumination with far\r\ngreater care than was necessary in the case of the hot air, and we\r\nconsequently can easily understand why we never see the waves under\r\nordinary conditions.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that laboratory appliances are generally required to\r\nrender them visible, I should like at the outset to cite an example to\r\nshow that in the case of very loud sounds occurring in the open air\r\nthe wave can be perceived by the eye, without the aid of any apparatus\r\nwhatever. I will quote from an article by Prof. C. V. Boys, which\r\nappeared in ‘Nature,’ June 24, 1897. Mr. Boys first cites the following\r\nletter from Mr. E. J. Ryves: “On Tuesday, April 6th, I had occasion,\r\nwhile carrying out some experiments with explosives, to detonate one\r\nhundred pounds of a nitro-compound. The explosive was placed on the\r\nground in the center of a slight depression, and in order to view the\r\neffect, I stationed myself, at a distance of about three hundred yards,\r\non the side of a neighboring-hill. The detonation was complete, and a\r\nhole was made in the ground five feet deep and seven feet in diameter.\r\nA most interesting observation was made during the experiment. The sun\r\nwas shining brightly, and at the moment of detonation the shadow of the\r\nsound wave was most distinctly seen leaving the area of disturbance.\r\nI heard the explosion as the shadow passed me, and I could follow it\r\ndistinctly in its course down the valley for at least half a mile; it\r\nwas so plainly visible that I believe it would photograph well with a\r\nsuitable shutter.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Boys at once made preparations for photographing the\r\nphenomenon at the first opportunity. On May 19th the experiment was\r\nmade. One hundred and twenty pounds of a nitro-compound were exploded,\r\nand an attempt made to photograph the sound shadow, both with the\r\ncamera and the kinematograph, the latter instrument designed and\r\noperated by Mr. Paul. Writing of the experiment, Professor Boys says:\r\n“On the day on which I was present, about one hundred and twenty pounds\r\nof a nitro-compound were detonated, and ten pounds of black powder\r\nwere added to make sufficient smoke to show on the plate. As the\r\ngrowth of the smoke cloud is far less rapid than the expansion of the\r\nsound shadow, no confusion could result from this. At the time of the\r\nexplosion my whole attention was concentrated upon the camera, and for\r\nthe moment I had forgotten to look for the ‘Ryves ring,’ as I think\r\nit might be called; but it was so conspicuous that it forced itself\r\nupon my attention. I _felt_, rather than _heard_, the explosion at\r\nthe moment that it passed. We stationed ourselves as near as prudence\r\nwould allow, at a distance of one hundred and twenty yards, so that\r\nonly about one third of a second elapsed between the detonation and the\r\npassage of the shadow. The actual appearance of the ring was that of\r\na strong, black, circular line, opening out with terrific speed from\r\nthe point of explosion as a center. It was impossible to judge of the\r\nthickness of the shadow; it may have been three feet, or it may have\r\nbeen more at first, and have gradually become less in thickness, or\r\npossibly in depth of shade.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Professor Boys’s apparatus did not work satisfactorily,\r\nbut a most interesting series of pictures was secured by the\r\nkinematograph. This instrument had been constructed especially for\r\ntaking pictures at a very high rate of speed, viz., eighty exposures\r\na second, or four times the usual number. The sound wave appears in\r\nthe first dozen pictures as a hazy ring of light, opening out from\r\nthe center of explosion. The ring, though not very conspicuous when\r\nthe pictures are viewed singly, becomes a striking object when they\r\nare projected in rapid succession on the screen. We see the rush of\r\nsmoke along the ground to the box in which the explosion is confined\r\n(the smoke of the quick fuse); then comes the burst of the explosion\r\nwith such startling reality that we involuntarily jump. The image of\r\nthe sound wave flies out in the form of a white ring, and is gone in\r\na moment; and there remain only the rolling clouds of smoke. It is\r\ninteresting to observe the development of the explosion by running the\r\nmachine quite slowly, and by thus magnifying time to follow the changes\r\nwhich ordinarily occur in such rapid succession that the eye is unable\r\nto perceive them.\r\n\r\nOf this series of pictures, Professor Boys says: “The kinematograph\r\nfails to show any _black_ ring; and this is not surprising, as with the\r\nexposure of about one one hundredth of a second the shadow would have\r\nto be at least eleven feet thick in order that some part should remain\r\nobscured during the whole exposure. As a fact, there is clearly seen a\r\ncircular light shading, which does--so far as one can judge from the\r\nsupposed rate of working and the known distances--expand at about the\r\nsame rate as the observed shadow, but it is lighter than the ground and\r\nshaded, instead of being dark and sharp, as seen by the eye.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KINETOSCOPE FILM OF EXPLOSION.]\r\n\r\nSo much for the visibility of sound under ordinary conditions. In\r\nthe laboratory, by means of an optical contrivance due to the German\r\nphysicist Toepler, we can secure a means of illumination so sensitive\r\nthat the warm air rising from a person’s hand appears like dense\r\nblack smoke. Moreover, since we are working on a small scale, we can\r\nuse the electric spark as the source of light, and dispense with the\r\nphotographic shutter. This is a great advantage, for the time of the\r\nexposure is, under these conditions, only about one fifty-thousandth of\r\na second, during which time the sound wave will move scarcely a quarter\r\nof an inch. During the past year I have made a very complete series\r\nof photographs of sound waves, which illustrate in a most beautiful\r\nmanner the fundamental principles of wave motion. It is not practicable\r\nto give here a full description of the apparatus used, but a brief\r\noutline may make the method intelligible. The sound photographed in\r\neach case is the crack of an electric spark, which is illuminated and\r\nphotographed by the light of a second spark, occurring a brief instant\r\nlater. In front of a large lens (a telescope objective, for example)\r\ntwo brass balls are mounted, between which the ‘sound spark,’ as I\r\nshall call it, passes. The instant the spark jumps across the gap, a\r\nspherical wave of condensed air starts out, which, when it reaches\r\nour ear, gives the sensation of a snap. The object is to photograph\r\nthis wave before it gets beyond the limits of the lens. The camera is\r\nmounted in front of the lens and focussed on the brass balls, which\r\nappear in line in the picture, so that the sound spark is always hidden\r\nby the front one. The spark, on jumping between the balls, charges a\r\nLeyden jar, which instantly discharges itself between two wires placed\r\nbehind the lens, producing the illuminating spark. This second spark\r\ncan be made to lag behind the first just long enough to catch the sound\r\nwave when it is but a few inches in diameter, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat the spherical wave is expanding at the rate of eleven hundred feet\r\na second. The photographs show in every case the circle of the lens\r\nfilled up with the light of the illuminating spark, the brass balls\r\n(in line) and the rods that support them, and the sound wave, which\r\nappears in the simplest case as a circle of light and shade surrounding\r\nthe balls. By placing an obstacle in the way of the wave we get the\r\nreflected wave or echo, and we shall see that the form of this echo may\r\nbe very complicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. SOUND WAVE REFLECTED FROM A PLANE SURFACE.]\r\n\r\nIt will be well at the outset to remind the reader of the close analogy\r\nbetween sound and light. A burning candle gives out spherical light\r\nwaves, just as the snapping sparks give out sound waves. The form of\r\nthe reflected light wave will be identical with that of a sound wave\r\nreflected under similar conditions. As we can not see the light waves\r\nthemselves, we can only determine their form by calculation, and\r\nit is interesting to see that the forms photographed are identical\r\nin every case with the calculated ones. The object in view was to\r\nsecure acoustical illustrations of as many of the phenomena connected\r\nwith light as possible. We will begin with the very simplest case of\r\nall: the reflection of a spherical sound wave from a flat surface,\r\ncorresponding to the reflection of light from a plane mirror. It can be\r\nshown by geometry that the reflected wave or echo will be a portion of\r\na sphere, the center of which lies as far below the reflecting surface\r\nas the point at which the sound originates is above it. In the case of\r\nlight, this point constitutes the image in the mirror. Referring to the\r\nphotograph, we see the reflected wave in three successive positions,\r\nthe interval between the sound spark and the illuminating spark having\r\nbeen progressively increased. The brass balls are shown at A, and\r\nbeneath them the flat plate B, which acts as a reflector. In the first\r\npicture the sound wave C appears as a circle of light and shade, and\r\nhas just intersected the plate. The echo appears at D. In the next\r\ntwo pictures the original wave has passed out of the field, and there\r\nremains only the echo.\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be not out of place to remind the reader of the\r\nrelation between rays of light and the wave surface. What we term light\r\nrays have no real existence, the ray being merely the path traversed by\r\na small portion of consecutive wave surfaces. Since the wave surface\r\nalways moves in a direction perpendicular to itself, the rays are\r\nalways normal to it. For instance, in the above case of a spherical\r\nwave diverging from a point, the rays radiate in all directions\r\nfrom the point; the same is true in the case of the echo, the rays\r\nradiating from the image point below the reflecting surface. In all\r\nsubsequent cases the reader can, if interested in tracing the analogy\r\nbetween sound and light, draw lines perpendicular to the reflected wave\r\nsurfaces representing the system of reflected waves.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider a second case of reflection. We know that if a\r\nlamp is placed in the focus of a concave mirror, the rays, instead of\r\ndiverging in all directions, issue from the mirror in a narrow beam.\r\nThe headlight of a locomotive and the naval searchlight are examples of\r\nthe practical use made of this property. If the curvature of the mirror\r\nis parabolical, the rays leaving it are parallel; consequently mirrors\r\nof this form are employed rather than spherical ones. But what has\r\nthe mirror done to the wave surface which is obviously spherical when\r\nit leaves the lamp, and what is its form after reflection? The wave\r\nsurface, I have said, is always perpendicular to the rays; consequently\r\nin cases where we have parallel rays we should expect the wave to be\r\nflat or plane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. SPHERICAL SOUND WAVE.]\r\n\r\nExamine the second photograph, which shows a spherical, sound wave\r\nstarting at the focus of a parabolic mirror. The echo appears as a\r\n_straight line_, instead of a circle as in the previous case, which\r\nshows us that the wave surface is flat.\r\n\r\nIf now our mirror is a portion of a sphere instead of a paraboloid,\r\nour reflected wave is not flat, and the reflected rays are not all\r\nparallel, the departure from parallelism increasing as we consider\r\nrays reflected from points farther and farther away from the center\r\nof the mirror. A photograph illustrating the reflection of sound\r\nunder these conditions is next shown, the echo wave being shaped like\r\na flat-bottomed saucer. As the saucer moves upward the curved sides\r\nconverge to a focus at the edge of the flat bottom, disappearing for\r\nthe moment (as is shown in the fourth picture of the series), and then\r\nreappearing on the under side after passing through the focus, the\r\nsaucer turning inside out.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of having a hemisphere, as in the last case, we have a\r\ncomplete spherical mirror, shutting the wave up inside a hollow ball,\r\nwe get exceedingly curious forms; for the wave can not get out, and\r\nis bounced back and forth, becoming more and more complicated at each\r\nreflection. This is illustrated in our next photograph, the mirror\r\nbeing a broad strip of metal bent into a circle.[D] Intricate as\r\nthese wave surfaces are, they have all been verified by geometrical\r\nconstructions, as I shall presently show.\r\n\r\n    [D] Cylindrical mirrors have been used instead of spherical,\r\n        for obvious reasons. A sectional view of the reflected wave\r\n        is the same in this case as when produced by a spherical\r\n        surface.\r\n\r\nAnother very interesting case of reflection is that occurring inside\r\nan elliptical mirror. When light diverges from one of the two foci of\r\nsuch a mirror, all the rays are brought accurately to the other focus.\r\nIf rays of light come to a focus from all directions, it is evident\r\nthat the wave surface must be a sphere, which, instead of expanding,\r\nis collapsing. This is very beautifully shown in the photographs. The\r\nsound wave starts in one focus and the reflected wave, of spherical\r\nform also, shrinks to a point at the other focus. (See fig. 5.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. A WAVE REFLECTED FROM A PORTION OF A SPHERE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. A WAVE FROM A CYLINDRICAL MIRROR.]\r\n\r\nIn the next series the wave starts outside of the field of the lens,\r\nand enters a hemispherical mirror. We know that a concave mirror has\r\nthe power of bringing light to a focus at a point situated half-way\r\nbetween the surface of the mirror and its center of curvature. If the\r\nlight comes from a very distant point, and the mirror is parabolic in\r\nform, the rays are brought _accurately_ to a focus; which means that\r\nthe reflected wave is a converging sphere,--a condition the opposite of\r\nthat in which spherical waves start in the focus of such a mirror. If,\r\nhowever, the mirror is spherical, only a portion of the light comes to\r\na focus. On examining the pictures we see that the reflected wave has\r\na form resembling a volcanic cone with a bowl-shaped crater. See the\r\nthird and fourth pictures of the series. The bowl of the crater shrinks\r\nto a point half-way between the surface of the mirror and its center\r\nof curvature, and represents that portion of the light which comes to\r\na focus, while the sides of the cone run in under the collapsing bowl,\r\nand eventually cross. (No. 6 of the series.) From now on the portion\r\nwhich has come to a focus diverges, uniting with the sides of the cone,\r\nthe whole passing out of the mirror in the form of a horseshoe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. A WAVE FROM AN ELLIPTICAL MIRROR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. A WAVE STARTING OUTSIDE THE FIELD OF THE LENS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. A CASE OF REFRACTION.]\r\n\r\nWe will now consider a case of refraction, and show the slower velocity\r\nof the sound wave in carbonic acid. A narrow glass tank, covered with\r\nan exceedingly thin film of collodion, was filled with the heavy gas\r\nand placed under the brass balls. When the sound wave strikes the\r\ncollodion surface, it breaks up into two components, one reflected\r\nback into the air, the other transmitted down through the carbonic\r\nacid. An examination of the series shows that the reflected wave in air\r\nhas moved farther from the collodion film than the transmitted wave,\r\nwhich, as a matter of fact, has been flattened out into a hyperboloid.\r\nExactly the same thing happens when light strikes a block of glass. We\r\nhave rays reflected from the surface, and rays transmitted through the\r\nblock, the waves which give rise to the latter moving slower than the\r\nones in air.\r\n\r\nA complete discussion of all of the cases that have been studied in\r\nthis way would probably prove wearisome to the general reader. Prisms\r\nand lenses of collodion filled with carbonic acid and hydrogen gas\r\nhave been made, and their action on the wave surface photographed.\r\nDiffraction, or the bending of the waves around obstacles, and the\r\nvery complicated effects when the waves are reflected from corrugated\r\nsurfaces, are also well shown. I shall, however, omit further mention\r\nof them and speak of but one other case, possibly the most beautiful of\r\nall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. A MUSICAL TONE.]\r\n\r\nIn all the cases that we have considered, it must be remembered that\r\nwe have been dealing with a single wave--a pulse, as it is called.\r\nMusical tones are caused by trains of waves, the pitch of the note\r\ncorresponding to the distance between the waves, or to the rate\r\nat which the separate pulses beat upon the drum of the ear. For\r\nstudying the changes produced by reflection, wave trains would have\r\nbeen useless, owing to the confusion which would have resulted from\r\nthe superposition of the different waves. Moreover, it is doubtful\r\nwhether an ordinary musical tone could be photographed in this way;\r\nfor the distance between the waves, even in the shrillest tones, is\r\nfour or five inches, and the abrupt change in density, necessary for\r\nthe perception of the wave, is not present. It is possible, however,\r\nto create a wave train or musical tone which can be photographed.\r\nThe reader may perhaps have noticed that on a very still night, when\r\nwalking beside a picket fence or in front of a high flight of steps,\r\nthe sounds of his footsteps are echoed from the palings as metallic\r\nsqueaks. Each picket, as the single wave caused by the footfall sweeps\r\nalong the fence, reflects a little wave; consequently a train of waves\r\nfalls on the ear, the distance between the waves corresponding to the\r\ndistance between the pickets. The closer together the pickets, the\r\nshriller the squeak. In point of fact, the distance between the waves\r\nin such a train is twice the distance between the palings, since they\r\nare not struck simultaneously by the footstep wave, but in succession.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon, of the creation of a musical tone by the reflection\r\nof a noise, was reproduced by reflecting the crack of the spark from\r\na little flight of steps. In the first picture the wave is seen half\r\nway between its origin and the reflecting surface. In the second it\r\nhas struck the top stair, which is giving off its echo, the first wave\r\nof our artificially constructed musical tone. In the third we find the\r\noriginal wave at the sixth step, with a well-developed train of five\r\nwaves rising from the flight. The following three pictures show the\r\nfurther development of the wave train. The height of each step was\r\nabout a quarter of an inch; consequently the distance between the waves\r\nwas half an inch. This would correspond to a note about three octaves\r\nabove the highest ever used in music.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 9. THE REFLECTION INSIDE THE HOLLOW SPHERE.]\r\n\r\nWhile experimenting with the complete circular mirror, which, it will\r\nbe remembered, gave the most complicated forms, it occurred to me that\r\na very vivid idea of how these curious wave surfaces are produced\r\ncould be obtained by preparing a complete series in proper order on\r\na kinetoscope film, and then projecting them in succession on the\r\nscreen. The experimental difficulties were, however, too great to make\r\nit seem worth while to attempt to obtain a series of pictures of the\r\nactual waves, it being very difficult to accurately regulate the time\r\ninterval between the two sparks. The easier method of making a large\r\nnumber of geometrical constructions, and then photographing them in\r\nsuccession on the film, was accordingly adopted. Three complete sets\r\nof drawings, to the number of about one hundred each, were prepared for\r\nthree separate cases of reflection;--viz.: the entrance of a plane wave\r\ninto a hemispherical mirror, the passage of a spherical wave out from\r\nthe focus of a hemispherical mirror, and the multiple reflection of a\r\nspherical wave inside of a complete spherical mirror. Special methods\r\nwere devised for simplifying the constructions, and much less labor was\r\nrequired in the preparation of the diagrams than one would suppose. The\r\nresults fully justified the labor, the evolutions of the waves being\r\nshown in a most striking manner. These films I exhibited before the\r\nRoyal Society in February last, and a more complete description of the\r\nmanner of preparing them may be found in the Proceedings of the Society.\r\n\r\nA portion of one of these series is reproduced, about one in four or\r\nfive of the separate diagrams being given. The series runs from left to\r\nright in horizontal rows. When projected on the screen, the spherical\r\nwave is seen gradually to expand from the focus point, like a swelling\r\nsoap bubble; it strikes the surface, and the bowl-shaped echo bounces\r\noff and follows the unreflected portion across the field; these two\r\nportions are then reflected in turn, and the curiously looped wave\r\nflies back and forth across the mirror, changing continuously all the\r\ntime, and becoming more complicated at each reflection. These diagrams\r\nshould be compared with the photographs shown in the fourth series.\r\n\r\nOne must not suppose that these beautiful forms exist only in the\r\nlaboratory. Every time we speak, spherical waves bounce off the floor,\r\nceiling and walls of the room, while in any ordinary bowl or basin\r\nthe curious crater-shaped echoes are formed. Glance once more at the\r\nwave surfaces produced within a hollow sphere, and try to imagine the\r\ncomplexity of the aerial vibrations caused by a fly buzzing around in\r\nan empty water-caraffe! The photographs enable us to realize what is\r\ngoing on around us all the time--this our perceptions are fortunately\r\ntoo dull to perceive. Life would be a nightmare if we were obliged to\r\nsee the myriads of flying sound waves bounding and rebounding about\r\nus in every direction, and combining into grotesque and ever-changing\r\nforms. It is just as well, on the whole, that the light of the electric\r\nspark and the delicate optical device of Toepler are necessary to bring\r\nthem into view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF RED.\r\n\r\nBY HAVELOCK ELLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong all colors, the most poignantly emotional tone undoubtedly\r\nbelongs to red. The ancient observation concerning the resemblance\r\nof scarlet to the notes of a trumpet has often been repeated, though\r\nit was probably unknown to the young Japanese lady who, on hearing a\r\nboy sing in a fine contralto voice, exclaimed: “That boy’s voice is\r\nred.” On the one hand, red is the color that idiots most easily learn\r\nto recognize; on the other hand, Kirchhoff, the chemist, called it\r\nthe most aristocratic of colors; Pouchet, the zoölogist, was inclined\r\nto think that it was a color apart, not to be paralleled with any\r\nother chromatic sensation, and recalled that the retinal pigment is\r\nred; Laycock, the physician, confessed that he preferred the gorgeous\r\nred tints of an autumn sunset to either musical sounds or gustatory\r\nflavors. Artists more cautious than men of science in expressing such\r\na preference--knowing that a color possesses its special virtue in\r\nrelation to other colors, and that all are of infinite variety--yet\r\neasily reveal, one may often note, a predilection for red by\r\nintroducing it into scenes where it is not naturally obvious, whether\r\nwe turn to a great landscape painter like Constable or to a great\r\nfigure painter like Rubens, who, with the development of his genius,\r\ndisplayed even greater daring in the introduction of red pigments into\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\nIn all parts of the world red is symbolical of joyous emotion. Often,\r\neither alone or in association with yellow, occasionally with green,\r\nit is the fortunate or sacred color. In lands so far apart as France\r\nand Madagascar scarlet garments were at one time the exclusive\r\nprivilege of the royal family. A great many different colors are\r\nsymbolical of mourning in various parts of the world; white, gray,\r\nyellow, brown, blue, violet, black can be so used, but, so far as I\r\nam aware, red never. Everywhere we find, again, that red pigments and\r\ndyes, and especially red ochre, are apparently the first to be used\r\nat the beginning of civilization, and that they usually continue to\r\nbe preferred even after other colors are introduced. There is indeed\r\none quarter of the globe where the allied color of yellow, which often\r\nelsewhere is the favorite after red, may be said to come first. In a\r\nregion of which the Malay peninsula is the center and which includes a\r\nlarge part of China, Burmah and the lower coast of India, yellow is the\r\nsacred and preferred color, but this is the only large district which\r\npresents us with any exception to the general rule, among either higher\r\nor lower races, and since yellow falls into the same group as red, and\r\nbelongs to a neighboring part of the spectrum, even this phenomenon can\r\nscarcely be said to clash seriously with the general uniformity.[E]\r\n\r\n    [E] A further partial exception is furnished by the tendency to\r\n        prefer green which may be found in certain countries, now\r\n        or formerly Mahommedan, such as North Africa and to a large\r\n        extent Spain, which have an arid and more or less desert\r\n        climate.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to Australia, whither the anthropologist often turns\r\nin order to explore some of the most primitive and undisturbed\r\ndata of early human culture still available for study, we find the\r\npreference for red very well marked. In times of rejoicing the tribes\r\nat Port Mackay, Curr remarked, paint themselves red; in times of\r\nmourning, white. In describing the paintings and rock carvings of the\r\nAustralians, Mathews states that red, white, black and occasionally\r\nyellow pigments were used, precisely the four pigments which Karl von\r\nden Steinen found in use in Central Brazil. Prof. Baldwin Spencer and\r\nMr. Gillen, in their valuable work on the natives of Central Australia,\r\nhave pointed out the significance and importance of red ochre. One of\r\nthe most striking and characteristic features, they say, of Central\r\nAustralians’ implements and weapons is the coating of red ochre with\r\nwhich the native covers everything except his spear and spear-thrower.\r\nThe hair is greased and red-ochred, and red ochre is the most striking\r\nfeature in decoration generally. For ages past the Australian native\r\nhas been accustomed to rub this substance regularly over his most\r\nsacred objects, and then over ordinary objects.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no need to go so far afield in order to illustrate\r\nthe primitive use of red ochre. Our own European ancestors followed\r\nexactly the same methods, and the German woman of early ages used red\r\nand yellow ochre to adorn her face and body, while the finds of the\r\nice age at Schussenquelle, described by Fraas, included a brilliant\r\nred paste (oxide of iron with reindeer fat) evidently intended for\r\npurposes of adornment. Moreover, the early artists of classic times had\r\nprecisely the same predilections in color as the aboriginal Australian\r\nartists. Red, white, black and yellow are the dominant colors in the\r\n_Iliad_, and Pliny mentions that the most ancient pictures were painted\r\nin various reds, while at a later date red and yellow predominated. He\r\nalso mentions that yellow was the favorite color of women for garments,\r\nand was specially used at marriages, while red being a sacred color\r\nand apt to provoke joy, was used at popular festivals, in the form of\r\nminium and cinnabar, to smear the statues of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThis well-nigh universal recognition of the peculiarly intense\r\nemotional tone of red is reflected in language. The color words\r\nof civilized and uncivilized peoples have been investigated with\r\ninteresting and on the whole remarkably harmonious results. It is only\r\nnecessary here to refer to them briefly in so far as they are related\r\nto our present subject. It seems that in every country the words for\r\nthe colors at the red end of the spectrum are of earlier appearance,\r\nmore definite and more numerous, than for those at the violet end. On\r\nthe Niger it appears that there are only three color words, red, white\r\nand black, and everything that is not white or black is called red. The\r\ncareful investigation of the natives of Torres Straits and New Guinea\r\nby Dr. W. H. R. Rivers, of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition,\r\nhas shown that at Murray Island, Mabuiag and Kiwai there were definite\r\nnames for red, less definite for yellow, still less so for green, while\r\nany definite name for blue could not be found. In this way as we pass\r\nfrom the colors of long wave-length towards those of short wave-length\r\nwe find the color nomenclature becoming regularly less definite. In\r\nKiwai and Murray Island the same word was applied to blue and black,\r\nand at Mabuiag there was a word (for sea-color) which could be applied\r\neither to blue or green, while Australian natives from Fitzroy River\r\nseemed limited to words for red, white and black. In a neighboring\r\nregion of Northern Queensland Dr. Walter Roth has reached almost\r\nidentical results, the tribes having distinct names for red and yellow,\r\nas applied to ochre, while blue is confounded in nomenclature with\r\nblack. In Brazil, again, while all tribes use separate words for red,\r\nyellow, white and black, only one had a word for blue and green. Even\r\nso æsthetic a people as the Japanese have no general words for either\r\nblue or green, and apply the same color word to a green tree and the\r\nunclouded sky.\r\n\r\nHere again we may trace similar phenomena in Europe; the same greater\r\nprimitiveness, precision and copiousness of the color vocabulary\r\nat the long wave end of the spectrum are found among Europeans as\r\nwell as among the lowest savages. The vagueness of the Greek color\r\nvocabulary, especially at the violet end of the spectrum, has led to\r\nmuch controversy. Latin was especially rich in synonyms for red and\r\nyellow, very poor in synonyms for green and blue. The Latin tongue\r\nhad even to borrow a word for blue from Teutonic speech; _caeruleus_\r\noriginally meant dark. Even in the second century A. D. Aulus Gellius,\r\nwho knew seven synonyms for red and yellow, scarcely mentions green and\r\nblue. Magnus has pointed out that a preference for the colors at the\r\nviolet end of the spectrum coincided with the spread of Christianity,\r\nto which we owe it, he believes, that yellow ceased to be popular and\r\nwas treated with opprobrium.[F] Modern English bears witness that our\r\nancestors, like the Homeric poets, resembled the Australian aborigines\r\nin identifying the color of the short wave end of the spectrum\r\nwith entire absence of color, for ‘blue’ and ‘black’ appear to be\r\netymologically the same word.\r\n\r\n    [F] In this connection I may mention that the preference\r\n        for green, which, as I have shown elsewhere (“The Color\r\n        Sense in Literature,” _Contemporary Review_, May, 1896),\r\n        developed in English literature with the rise of Puritanism\r\n        in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nAt this point we come across an interesting and once warmly debated\r\nquestion. It was maintained some twenty years ago by writers who had\r\nbeen impressed by the defectiveness of the color vocabulary at the\r\nshort wave-length end of the spectrum, that primitive man generally,\r\nand early Hellenic man in particular, were insensitive to the colors\r\nat that end of the spectrum, and unable to distinguish them. On\r\ninvestigation of individuals belonging to savage races it appeared,\r\nhowever, that no marked inferiority in color discrimination could\r\nbe demonstrated. Hence it became clear that the vague and defective\r\nvocabulary for blue and green must be due to some other cause than\r\nvague and defective perception, and that sensation and nomenclature\r\nwere not sufficiently parallel to enable us to argue from one to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThat, in the main, is a conclusion which still holds good. In all parts\r\nof the world it has been found that color discrimination, even amongst\r\nthe lowest savages, is far more accurate than color nomenclature. Thus\r\nof an African Bantu tribe, the Mang’anja, Miss Werner states that\r\nthey can discriminate all varieties of blue in beads, but call them\r\nall black. The sky is black; so is any green, brown or grey article,\r\nthough a very bright grey counts as white. Violet or purple is black.\r\nYellow is either red or white. A word supposed sometimes to mean green\r\nreally means raw, unripe or even wet. Thus the Mang’anja only have\r\nthree colors--black, white and red. In quite a different region, the\r\nZulus, more advanced in color nomenclature, have not only black, white\r\nand red, but a word which may mean either green or blue, and another\r\nwhich means yellow, buff or grey, or some shade of brown. At the same\r\ntime it now appears that the earlier scientific writers on this subject\r\nwere not entirely wrong in stating that among savages there is some\r\nactual failure of perception at the short wave end of the spectrum,\r\nalthough they were wrong in arguing that it was necessarily involved\r\nin the defects of color vocabulary, and in imagining that it could\r\nbe as extensive as that hypothesis demanded. It now appears that the\r\nconclusions reached by Hugo Magnus of Breslau, as expressed in 1883\r\nin his study ‘Ueber Ethnologische Untersuchungen des Farbensinnes,’\r\nfairly answer to the facts. In large measure relying on the examination\r\nof 300 Chukchis made by Almquist during the Nordenskiold Expedition,\r\nMagnus concluded that although the color vision of the uncivilized has\r\nthe same range from red to violet as that of the civilized and all the\r\ncolors can usually be separately distinguished, there is sometimes a\r\ncertain dullness, a diminished energy of sensation, as regards green\r\nand blue, the shorter and more refrangible waves of the spectrum, while\r\nthe colors at the other end are perceived with much greater vividness.\r\nStephenson, more recently, among over one thousand Chinese, examined at\r\nvarious places, found only one case of color blindness, but a frequent\r\ntendency to confuse green and blue and also blue and purple, while\r\nDr. Adele Fielde, of Swatow, China, among 1,200 Chinese of both sexes\r\nexamined by Thomson’s wool test, found that more than half mixed up\r\ngreen and blue, and many even seemed to be quite blind to violet.\r\nErnest Krause also has argued that primitive man was most sensitive to\r\nthe red end of the spectrum, hence setting about to obtain red pigments\r\nand acquiring definite names for them, an explanation which is accepted\r\nby Karl von den Steinen to account for the phenomena among the Central\r\nBrazilians. The recent investigations of Rivers at Torres Straits have\r\nconfirmed the conclusions of Magnus. He found that, corresponding\r\nto the defect of color terminology, though to a much less degree,\r\nthere appeared to be an actual defect of vision for colors of short\r\nwave-length; in testing with colored wools no mistake was ever made\r\nwith reds, but blues and greens were constantly confused, as were blue\r\nand violet.\r\n\r\nIt may even be argued that the same defect exists to a minor degree\r\nnot only among the peoples of Eastern Asia whose æsthetic sense is\r\nhighly developed, but among civilized Europeans when any kind of\r\ncolor blindness is altogether excluded. This was noted long since by\r\nHolmgren, who remarked that some persons, though able to distinguish\r\nbetween blue and green wools when placed together, were liable to call\r\nthe blue wool green, and the green blue, when they saw them separately.\r\nMagnus also showed that such an inability is apt to appear at a very\r\nearly stage in some persons when the illumination is diminished,\r\nalthough the perception of red and yellow remains perfectly distinct.\r\nHe further showed that blue and green at certain distances are often\r\nmuch more difficult to recognize than red. Most people probably are\r\nconscious of difficulty in distinguishing blue and green pigments\r\nwith diminished light and find that blue easily passes into black.\r\nViolet also appears for many people to be merely a variety of blue;\r\nthe word itself, we may note, is recent in our language, and plays\r\na very small part in our poetic literature, and in fact the color\r\nitself, if we rigidly exclude purple, is extremely rare in nature. It\r\nis a noteworthy fact in this connection that in normal persons the\r\ncolor sense may be easily educated; this is not merely a fact of daily\r\nobservation, but has been exactly demonstrated by Féré, who by means of\r\nhis chromoptoscopic boxes, containing very dilute colored solutions,\r\nfound that with practice it was possible to recognize solutions which\r\nhad previously seemed uncolored. It is also noteworthy that in the\r\nachromatopsia of the hysterical, as Charcot showed and as Parimand has\r\nsince confirmed, the order in which the colors usually disappear is\r\nviolet, green, blue, red; sometimes the paradoxical fact is found that\r\nred will give a luminous sensation in a contracted visual field when\r\neven white gives no luminous sensation. This persistence of red vision\r\nin the hysterical is only one instance of a predilection for red which\r\nhas often been noted as very marked among the hysterical. Red also\r\nexerted a great fascination over the victims of the mediæval hysterical\r\nepidemics of tarantism in Italy, while the victims of the German\r\nmediæval epidemic of St. Vitus’s dance imagined that they were immersed\r\nin a stream of blood which compelled them to leap up.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that red and perhaps yellow have been stated to\r\nbe the only colors visible in dreams; this is possibly due to the\r\nblood-vessels. Such an explanation is probable with regard to the\r\nvarious subjective visual sensations which constitute an aura in\r\nepilepsy, among which, as Gowers notes, red and reddish yellow are most\r\nfrequently found. Féré has further noted that in various emotional\r\nstates somewhat resembling epilepsy, and even in mystic exaltation,\r\nred may be subjectively seen. Simroth has gone so far as to argue\r\nthat not only is red fundamental in human color psychology, but that\r\nin living organisms generally, even as a pigment, red is the most\r\nprimitive of colors, that since the algæ at the greatest sea-depths\r\nare red it is possible that protoplasm at first only responded to rays\r\nof long wave-length, and that with increased metabolism colors became\r\ndifferentiated, following the order in the spectrum.\r\n\r\nIf it is really the case that in the evolution of the race familiarity\r\nwith the red end of the spectrum has been earlier and more perfectly\r\nacquired than with the violet end, and that red and yellow made a more\r\nprofound impression on primitive man than green and blue, we should\r\nexpect to find this evolution reflected in the development of the\r\nindividual, and that the child would earlier acquire a sensitiveness\r\nfor red and orange and yellow than for green and blue and violet. This\r\nseems actually to be the case. The study of the color sense in children\r\nis, indeed, even more difficult than in savages; and many investigators\r\nhave probably succumbed to the fallacies involved in this study.\r\nDoubtless we may thus account for some discrepancies in the attempts\r\nto ascertain the facts of color perception and color preference in\r\nchildren, while doubtless also there are individual differences which\r\ndiscount the value of experiments made on only a single child. A few\r\ncareful and elaborate investigations, however, especially that of\r\nGarbini on 600 North Italian children of various ages, have thrown much\r\nlight on the matter. There is fairly general agreement that red is the\r\nfirst color that attracts young children and which they recognize. That\r\nis the result recorded by Uffelmann in Germany, while Preyer found\r\nyellow and red at the head; Binet in France concluded that red comes\r\nfirst; Wolfe in America reached the same result, and Luckey noted that\r\nhis own children seemed to enjoy red, orange and yellow very much\r\nearlier than they could perceive blue, which seemed to come last.\r\nBaldwin, indeed, found in the case of his own child that blue seemed\r\nmore attractive than red; his methods have, however, been criticised,\r\nand his experiments failed to include yellow. Mrs. Moore found that\r\nher baby, between the sixteenth and forty-fifth weeks, nearly always\r\npreferred a yellow ball to a red ball; this was doubtless not a\r\nmatter of color, but of brightness, for there is no reason to suppose\r\nchromatic perception at so early an age. Red, orange and yellow, it may\r\nbe added, are perceived by a slightly lower illumination than green,\r\nblue and violet, the last being the most difficult of all to perceive,\r\nso that it is not surprising that the colors at the violet end should\r\nbe inconspicuous to young infants. Garbini, whose experiments are worth\r\nnoting in more detail, found that the order of perception is red,\r\ngreen, yellow, orange, blue and violet, and as he experimented with a\r\nlarge number of children and used methods which so competent a judge as\r\nBinet regards as approaching perfection, his results may be considered\r\na fair approach to the truth. He found that for the first few days\r\nafter birth the infant shuns the light; then, about the fourteenth\r\nday, he ceases to be photophobic and begins to enjoy the light, as is\r\nshown by his being quieted when brought into a bright light and crying\r\nwhen taken from it; this may sometimes begin even about the fifth\r\nday. Between the fifth week and the eighteenth month children show\r\nsigns of distinguishing white, black and grey objects. It is not until\r\nafter the eighteenth month that their chromatic perception begins,\r\nany preference for red and yellow objects at an earlier age being due\r\nmerely to their greater luminosity. Garbini considers that it is the\r\ncenter of the retina, or the portion most sensitive to red and yellow,\r\nwhich is most exercised in young infants. Between the second and third\r\nyears children, both boys and girls, were found to be most successful\r\nin the recognition of red, then of green, but they very often confused\r\norange with red, and mixed up yellow, blue, violet and green; he thinks\r\nthey tend to confuse a color with the preceding color in spectral\r\norder. Under the age of three children may be said to be color-blind,\r\nand they are liable to confuse rosy tints with green. Between the ages\r\nof three and five they are able to distinguish red in any gradation,\r\ngreen nearly always, with an occasional confusion with red, while\r\nyellow is sometimes confused with orange, orange sometimes replaced\r\nby rose, blue often not recognized in its gradations, and violet\r\noften selected in place of blue. At this age, also (as in hysterical\r\nanæsthesia of the retina), blue seems dark or black. In the fifth and\r\nsixth years red, green and yellow are always correctly chosen; orange\r\ngradations are not always recognized, and blue and violet come last,\r\nbeing sometimes confused. In the sixth year children are perfecting\r\ntheir knowledge of orange, blue and violet and completing their\r\nknowledge of color designations. Garbini has reached the important\r\nresult that color perceptions and verbal expression of the perceptions\r\nfollow exactly parallel paths, so that in studying verbal expression\r\nwe are really studying perception, with the important distinction\r\nthat the expression comes much later than the perception.[G] These\r\ninvestigations of Garbini are very significant, and there can be little\r\ndoubt that the evolution of the child’s color sense repeats that of the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n    [G] Garbini, “Evoluzione del senso cromatico nella infanzia,”\r\n        _Archivio per l’Antropologia_, 1894. I.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the color perceptions of savages and children we are,\r\nof course, to some extent dealing more or less unconsciously with their\r\ncolor preferences. There is some interest from our present point of\r\nview in considering the conscious color preferences of young and adult\r\ncivilized persons. Red, as we have seen, is the color that fascinates\r\nour attention earliest, that we see and recognize most vividly; it\r\nremains the color that attracts our attention most readily and that\r\ngives us the greatest emotional shock. It by no means necessarily\r\nfollows that it is the most pleasurable color. As a matter of fact,\r\nsuch evidence as is available shows that very often it is not. There\r\nseems reason to think that after the first early perception of red,\r\nand early pleasure in it, yellow or orange is frequently the favorite\r\ncolor, the preference often lasting during several years of childhood;\r\nPreyer’s child liked and discriminated yellow best, and Miss Shinn was\r\ninclined to think that it was the favorite color of her niece, who in\r\nthe twenty-eighth month showed a special fondness for daffodils and\r\nfor a yellow dress. Barnes found that in children the love of yellow\r\ndiminishes with age. Binet’s child was specially preoccupied with\r\norange. Aars in an elaborate and frequently varied investigation into\r\nthe color preferences of eight children (four of each sex), between\r\nfour and seven years of age, found that with the boys the order of\r\npreference was blue and yellow (both equal), then red, lastly green;\r\nwhile with the girls the order was green, blue, red and yellow; in\r\ncombinations of two colors it was found that combinations of blue come\r\nfirst, then of yellow, then green, lastly red. It was found (as J. Cohn\r\nhas found among adults and cultivated people) that the deepest and most\r\nsaturated color was most pleasing; and also that the love of novelty\r\nand of variety was an important factor. It will be observed that at\r\nthis age green was the girls’ favorite color and that least liked by\r\nthe boys, whose favorite color, in combination, was blue; the number\r\nof individuals was, however, small. This was in Germany. In America,\r\namong 1,000 children, probably somewhat older on the average (though I\r\nhave not details of the inquiry), Mr. Earl Barnes found, like Dr. Aars,\r\nthat more boys than girls selected blue, while the girls preferred red\r\nmore frequently than the boys; Barnes considers that with growing years\r\nthere is a growing tendency to select red; as is well known, girls are\r\nmore precocious than boys. Among 100 students at Columbia University,\r\nthe order of preference was found to be blue (34 per cent), red (22.7\r\nper cent), and then at a more considerable distance violet, yellow,\r\ngreen. It is noteworthy that among 100 women students at Wellesley\r\nCollege the order of preference was not very different, being blue\r\n(38 per cent), red (18 per cent), yellow, green, violet; in a later\r\ninvestigation the order remained the same, there being only some\r\nincrease in the preference for red; it was considered that association\r\naccounted for the preference for blue, while more conscious as well as\r\nmore emotional elements entered into the preference for red.\r\n\r\nBy far the most extensive investigation of color preference was that\r\ncarried on at Chicago by Professor Jastrow on 4,500 persons, mostly\r\nadults, of both sexes and various nationalities.[H] Blue was found\r\nto be the favorite color, less than half as many persons preferring\r\nred; of every thirty men ten voted for blue and three for red, while\r\nof every thirty women five voted for red and four for blue. The men\r\nalso liked violet and on the whole confined their choice to but few\r\ncolors, the women also liked pink, green (very seldom chosen by men)\r\nand yellow, and showed a tendency to choose light and dainty shades.\r\nThere was on the whole a decided preference for dark shades; the least\r\nfavorite colors were yellow and orange. It is evident that, as we\r\nshould expect, within the elementary field of popular æsthetics, women\r\nshow a more trained feeling for color than men.\r\n\r\n    [H] J. Jastrow, “The Popular Æsthetics of Color,” _Popular\r\n        Science Monthly_, 1897.\r\n\r\nIt is not quite easy to coördinate the various phenomena of color\r\npredilection. Careful and extended observations are still required. It\r\nseems to me, however, that the facts, as at present ascertained, do\r\nsuggest a certain order and harmony in the phenomena. It is difficult\r\nnot to believe that there really is, both among many uncivilized\r\npeoples and also many children at an early age, even to a slight extent\r\namong civilized adults, a relative inability, by no means usually\r\nabsolute, to recognize and distinguish the tones of color at the more\r\nrefrangible end of the spectrum. The earliest writers on the subject\r\nwere wrong when they supposed that color nomenclature at all accurately\r\ncorresponded to color perception, and it is well recognized that there\r\nare no peoples who are wholly unable to distinguish between green\r\nand blue and black. But as Garbini has clearly shown, there really\r\nis a parallelism between color nomenclature and color recognition,\r\nand Garbini’s wide investigation has confirmed the experiments of\r\nPreyer on a single child by showing that there is a certain hesitancy\r\nand uncertainty in recognizing the colors at the more refrangible\r\nend of the spectrum, long after children are familiar with the less\r\nrefrangible end. In the same way the important investigations of\r\nRivers have confirmed the earlier observations of Magnus and Almquist\r\nin showing that savages in many cases exhibit a certain difficulty\r\nin recognizing and distinguishing blue and green, such as they never\r\nexperience with red and yellow. The vagueness of color nomenclature\r\nas regards blue and green thus indicates, though grossly exaggerating,\r\na real psychological fact, and in this way we have an explanation of\r\nthe curious fact that in widely separated parts of the world (at Torres\r\nStraits, among the Esthonians at Rome, etc.) as civilization progressed\r\nit was found necessary to borrow a word for blue from other languages.\r\n\r\nThere is almost complete harmony among a number of observers, now very\r\nconsiderable, in many countries, showing that the colors children first\r\ntake notice of and recognize are red and yellow, most observers putting\r\nred first. There is no true predilection for these colors at this early\r\nage because the other colors do not yet seem to have been perceived.\r\nAt first, doubtless, all colors appear to the infant as light or dark,\r\nwhite or black. That this is so is indicated by the experience of Dr.\r\nGeorge Harley, who at one period of his life, in order to cure an\r\ninjury to the retina caused by overwork at the microscope, resolutely\r\nspent nine months in absolutely total and uninterrupted darkness. When\r\nhe emerged he found that, like an infant, he was unable to appreciate\r\ndistance by the eye, while he had also lost the power of recognizing\r\ncolors; for the first month all light colors appeared to him perfectly\r\nwhite and all dark colors perfectly black. He fails to state the order\r\nin which the colors reappeared to him. It is well recognized, however,\r\nthat eyes long unexposed to light become color-blind for all colors\r\nexcept red. Preyer’s child in the fourth year was surprised that in the\r\ntwilight her bright blue stockings looked grey, while for some time\r\nlonger she always called dark green black. By the sixth year all colors\r\nare seen and known with fair correctness. Among young children at this\r\nage, so far as the evidence yet goes, red is rarely the preferred\r\ncolor, this being more often yellow, green or blue. There is doubtless\r\nroom here for a great amount of individual difference, but on the whole\r\nit appears that children prefer those colors which they have most\r\nrecently learnt to recognize, the colors which have all the charm of\r\nnovelty and newly-won possession. It is probable, too, that (as Groos\r\nhas also suggested) the stimulation of red is too painfully strong\r\nin this stage of the development of the color sense to be altogether\r\npleasurable, in the same way that orchestral music is often only a\r\ndisturbing noise to children.\r\n\r\nOne may note in this connection that hyperæsthesia to color is nearly\r\nalways an undue sensibility to red and very rarely to any other color.\r\nThe case has been recorded of a highly neurotic officer who, for more\r\nthan thirty years, was intolerant of red-colored objects. The dazzling\r\nproduced by scarlet uniforms, especially in bright sunshine, seriously\r\ninterfered with the performance of his duties, and in private life red\r\nparasols, shawls, etc., produced similar effects; he was often overcome\r\nin the streets by giddiness, sometimes almost before he realized that\r\nhe was looking at a red object. Many years ago Laycock referred to the\r\ncase of a lady who could not bear to look at anything red, and Elliston\r\nalso had a lady patient to whom red was very obnoxious, and who, when\r\nput into a room with red curtains, drank seven quarts of fluid a day.\r\nI am not aware that any such hyperæsthesia exists in the case of other\r\ncolors. It is also noteworthy that the morbid affection in which color\r\nis seen when it does not exist is most usually a condition in which\r\nred is seen (erythropsia), yellow being the color most frequently seen\r\nafter red (a condition called xanthopsia); the other colors are very\r\nrarely seen, and Hilbert, in his monograph on the pathology of the\r\ncolor sense, considers that this is due to the fact that red and yellow\r\nmake the most intense effect on the sensorium, which thus becomes\r\nliable not only to direct but to reflected irritation, in the absence\r\nof any external color stimulus. There are other facts which show that\r\nof all colors red is that which acts as the most powerful stimulus on\r\nthe organism. Münsterberg, in some interesting experiments which he\r\nmade to illustrate the motor power of visual impressions as measured\r\nby their arresting action on the eye-muscles, found that red and\r\nyellow have considerably more motor power in stimulating the eye than\r\nthe other colors. It may be added also that, as Quantz has found, we\r\noverestimate the magnitude of colors of the less refrangible part of\r\nthe spectrum and underestimate the others.\r\n\r\nAfter puberty blue seems still to maintain its position, but red has\r\nnow come more to the front, while yellow has definitely receded;\r\nalthough so favorite a color in classic antiquity, it is rarely the\r\npreferred color among ourselves. J. Cohn in Germany found that among a\r\ndozen students it was never in any degree of saturation the preferred\r\ncolor, while at Cornell Major found that all the subjects investigated\r\nconsidered yellow and orange either unpleasant or among the least\r\npleasant colors.\r\n\r\nWhile blue seems to be the color most usually preferred by men, red\r\nis more commonly preferred by women, who also show a more marked\r\npredilection for its complementary green. Whether the feminine love\r\nof red shows a fine judgment we could better decide if we knew among\r\nwhat classes of the population red lovers and blue lovers respectively\r\npredominate; it may be noted, however, that the necessities of dress\r\ngive the most ordinary woman an acquaintance with the elementary\r\næsthetics of color which the average man has no occasion to acquire. In\r\nany case it might have been anticipated that, even though the typically\r\n‘cold’ color should appeal most strongly to men, the most emotional of\r\ncolors should appeal most strongly to women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTERS ON THE STARS.\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR SIMON NEWCOMB, U. S. N.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTELLATIONS AND STAR NAMES.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times the practice was adopted of imagining the figures of\r\nheroes and animals to be so outlined in the heavens as to include in\r\neach figure a large group of the brighter stars. In a few cases some\r\nvague resemblance may be traced between the configurations of the stars\r\nand the features of the object they are supposed to represent; in\r\ngeneral, however, the arrangement seems quite arbitrary. One animal or\r\nman could be fitted in as well as another. There is no historic record\r\nor trace as to the time when the constellations were mapped out, or of\r\nthe process by which the outlines were traced. The names of heroes,\r\nsuch as Perseus, Cepheus, Hercules, etc., intermingled with the names\r\nof goddesses, show that the constellations were probably mapped out\r\nduring the heroic age. No maps are extant showing exactly how each\r\nfigure was placed in the constellation; but in the catalogue of stars\r\ngiven by Ptolemy in his ‘Almagest,’ the positions of particular stars\r\non the supposed body of the hero, goddess or animal are designated with\r\nsuch precision as he had at command, in some fairly precise position of\r\nthe figure. For example, Aldebaran is said to have formed the eye of\r\nthe Bull. Two other stars marked the right and left shoulders of Orion,\r\nand a small cluster marked the position of his head. A row of three\r\nstars in a horizontal line showed his belt, three stars in a vertical\r\nline below them his sword. In this way the position of the figure can\r\nbe reproduced with a fair degree of certainty.\r\n\r\nIn the well-known constellation _Ursa Major_, the Great Bear,\r\nfamiliarly known as the Dipper, three stars form the tail of the\r\nanimal, and four others a part of his body. This formation is not\r\nunnatural, yet the figure of a dipper fits the stars much better than\r\nthat of a bear. In Cassiopeia, which is on the opposite side of the\r\npole from the Dipper, the brighter stars may easily be imagined to form\r\na chair in which a lady may be seated without further difficulty. As a\r\ngeneral rule, however, the resemblances of the stars to the figure are\r\nso vague that the latter might be interchanged to any extent without\r\ndetracting from their appropriateness.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it was impossible so to arrange the figures that they\r\nshould cover the entire heavens; blank spaces were inevitably left\r\nin which stars might be found. In order to include every star in\r\nsome constellation, the figures have been nearly ignored by modern\r\nastronomers, and the heavens have been divided up, by somewhat\r\nirregular lines, into patches, each of which contains the entire figure\r\nas recognized by ancient astronomers. But all are not agreed as to the\r\nexact outlines of these extended constellations, and, accordingly, a\r\nstar is sometimes placed in one constellation by one astronomer and in\r\nanother constellation by another astronomer.\r\n\r\nThe confusion thus arising is especially great in the southern\r\nhemisphere, where it has been intensified by the subdivision of one\r\nof the old constellations. The ancient constellation _Argo_ covered\r\nso large a region of the heavens, and included so many conspicuous\r\nstars, that it was divided into four, representing various parts of a\r\nship--the sail, the poop, the prow and the hull.\r\n\r\nDr. Gould, while director of the Cordoba Observatory, during the years\r\n1870 to 1880, constructed the ‘Uranometria Argentina,’ in which all\r\nthe stars visible to the naked eye more than 10 degrees south of the\r\ncelestial equator were catalogued and mapped. He made a revision of the\r\nboundaries of each constellation in such a way as to introduce greater\r\nregularity. The rule generally followed was that the boundaries should,\r\nso far as possible, run in either an east and west or a north and south\r\ndirection on the celestial sphere. They were so drawn that the smallest\r\npossible change should be made in the notation of the conspicuous\r\nstars; that is, the rule was that, if possible, each bright star should\r\nbe in the same constellation as before. The question whether this new\r\ndivision shall replace the ancient one is one on which no consensus of\r\nview has yet been reached by astronomers. Simplicity is undoubtedly\r\nintroduced by Gould’s arrangement; yet, in the course of time, owing\r\nto precession, the lines on the sphere which now run north and south\r\nor east and west will no longer do so, but will deviate almost to any\r\nextent. The only advantage then kept will be that the bounding lines\r\nwill generally be arcs of great circles.\r\n\r\nWhen the heavens began to be carefully studied, two or three centuries\r\nago, new constellations were introduced by Hevelius and other\r\nastronomers to fill the vacant spaces left by the ancient ones of\r\nPtolemy. To some of these, rather fantastic names were given; the Bull\r\nof Poniatowski, for example. Some of these new additions have been\r\nretained to the present time, but in other cases the space occupied\r\nby the proposed new constellation was filled up by extending the\r\nboundaries of the older ones.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the astronomical world, by common consent,\r\nrecognizes eighty-nine constellations in the entire heavens. In this\r\nenumeration _Argo_ is not counted, but its four subdivisions are taken\r\nas separate constellations.\r\n\r\nNAMES OF THE STARS.\r\n\r\nA glance at the heavens will make it evident that the problem of\r\ndesignating a star in such a way as to distinguish it from all its\r\nneighbors must be a difficult one. If such be the case with the\r\ncomparatively small number of stars visible to the naked eye, how must\r\nit be with the vast number that can be seen only with the telescope?\r\nIn the case of the great mass of telescopic stars we have no method\r\nof designation except by the position of the star and its magnitude;\r\nbut with the brighter stars, and, indeed, with all that have been\r\ncatalogued, other means of identification are available.\r\n\r\nIt is but natural to give a special name to a conspicuous star.\r\nThat this was done in very early antiquity we know by the allusion\r\nto Arcturus in the Book of Job. At least two such names, Castor and\r\nPollux, have come down to us from classical antiquity, but most of the\r\nspecial names given to the stars in modern times are corruptions of\r\ncertain Arabic designations. As an example we may mention Aldebaran, a\r\ncorruption of Al Dabaran--The Follower. There is, however, a tendency\r\nto replace these special names by a designation of the stars on a\r\nsystem devised by Bayer early in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThis system of naming stars is quite analogous to our system of\r\ndesignating persons by a family name and a Christian name. The family\r\nname of a star is that of the constellation to which it belongs. The\r\nChristian name is a letter of the Greek or Roman alphabet, or a number.\r\nAs a number of men in different families may have the same Christian\r\nname, so the Greek letter or number may be given to a star in any\r\nnumber of constellations without confusion.\r\n\r\nThe work of Bayer was published under the title of ‘Uranometria,’ of\r\nwhich the first edition appeared in 1601. This work consists mainly\r\nof maps of the stars. In marking the stars with letters on the map,\r\nthe rule followed seems to have been to give the brighter stars the\r\nearlier letters in the alphabet. Were this system followed absolutely,\r\nthe brighter stars should always be called α; the next in order β,\r\netc. But this is not always the case. Thus in the constellation\r\n_Gemini_, the brighter star is Pollux, which is marked β, while α is\r\nthe second brightest. What system, if any, Bayer adopted in detail\r\nhas been a subject of discussion, but does not appear to have been\r\nsatisfactorily made out. Quite likely Bayer himself did not attempt\r\naccurate observations on the brightness of the stars, but followed the\r\nindications given by Ptolemy or the Arabian astronomers. As the number\r\nof stars to be named in several constellations exceeds the number of\r\nletters in the Greek alphabet, Bayer had recourse, after the Greek\r\nalphabet was exhausted, to letters of the Roman alphabet. In this\r\ncase the letter _A_ was used as a capital, in order, doubtless, that\r\nit should not be confounded with the Greek α. In other cases smaller\r\nitalics are used. In several catalogues since Bayer, new italic\r\nletters have been added by various astronomers. Sometimes these have\r\nmet with general acceptance, and sometimes not.\r\n\r\nFlamsteed was the first Astronomer Royal in England, and observed at\r\nGreenwich from 1666 to 1715. Among his principal works is a catalogue\r\nof stars in which the positions are given with greater accuracy than\r\nhad been attained by his predecessors. He slightly altered the Bayer\r\nsystem by introducing numbers instead of Greek letters. This had the\r\nadvantage that there was no limit to the number of stars which could\r\nbe designated in each constellation. He assigned numbers to all the\r\nbrighter stars in the order of their right ascension, irrespective\r\nof the letters used by Bayer. These numbers are extensively used to\r\nthe present day, and will doubtless continue to be the principal\r\ndesignations of the stars to which they refer. It is very common in\r\nour modern catalogues to give both the Bayer letter and the Flamsteed\r\nnumber in the case of Bayer stars.\r\n\r\nThe catalogues by Flamsteed do not include quite all the stars visible\r\nto the naked eye, but various uranometries have been published which\r\nwere intended to include all such stars. In such cases the designations\r\nnow used frequently correspond to the numbers given in the uranometries\r\nof Bode, Argelander and Heis.\r\n\r\nIn recent times these uranometries have been supplemented by censuses\r\nof the stars, which are intended to include all the stars to the ninth\r\nor tenth magnitude. I shall speak of these in the next section; at\r\npresent it will suffice to say that stars are very generally designated\r\nby their place in such a census.\r\n\r\nThere is still here and there some confusion both as to the boundaries\r\nof the constellations and as to the names of a few of the stars in\r\nthem. I have already remarked that, in drawing the imaginary boundaries\r\non a star map, as representing the celestial sphere, different\r\nastronomers have placed the lines differently. One of the regions in\r\nwhich this is especially true is in the neighborhood of the north pole,\r\nwhere some astronomers place stars in the constellation Cepheus which\r\nothers place in Ursa Minor. Hence in the Bayer system the same star may\r\nhave different names in different catalogues. Again, in extending the\r\nnames or numbers, some astronomers use names which others do not regard\r\nas authoritative. The remapping of the southern constellation by Dr.\r\nGould changed the boundaries of most of the southern constellations in\r\na way already mentioned.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the subdivision of the great constellation _Argus_\r\ninto four separate ones. Bayer having assigned to the principal\r\nstars in this constellation the Greek letters α, β, γ, etc., the\r\ngeneral practice among astronomers since the subdivision has been to\r\ncontinue the designation of the stars thus marked as belonging to the\r\nconstellation _Argo_. Thus, for example, we have _Argus_, which after\r\nthe subdivision belonged to the constellation _Carina_. The variable\r\nstar η Argus also belongs to the constellation _Carina_. But in the\r\ncase of stars not marked by Bayer, the names were assigned according to\r\nthe subdivided constellations, _Vela_, _Carina_, etc. Confusing though\r\nthis proceeding may appear to be, it is not productive of serious\r\ntrouble. The main point is that the same star should always have the\r\nsame name in successive catalogues. Still, however, it has recently\r\nbecome quite common to ignore the constellation _Argus_ altogether and\r\nuse only the names of its subdivisions. The reader must therefore be\r\non his guard against any mistake arising in this way in the study of\r\nastronomical literature.\r\n\r\nIn star catalogues the position of a star in the heavens is sometimes\r\ngiven in connection with its name. In this case the confusion arising\r\nfrom the same star having different names may be avoided, since a\r\nstar can always be identified by its right ascension and declination.\r\nThe fact is that, so far as mere identification is concerned,\r\nnothing but the statement of a star’s position is really necessary.\r\nUnfortunately, the position constantly changes through the precession\r\nof the equinoxes, so that this designation of a star is a variable\r\nquantity. Hence the special names which we have described are the most\r\nconvenient to use in the case of well-known stars. In other cases a\r\nstar is designated by its number in some well-known catalogue. But even\r\nhere different astronomers choose different catalogues, so that there\r\nare still different designations for the same star. The case is one in\r\nwhich action of uniformity of practice is unattainable.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATALOGUING AND NUMBERING THE STARS.\r\n\r\nA catalogue or list of stars is a work giving for each star listed its\r\nmagnitude and its position on the celestial sphere, with such other\r\nparticulars as may be necessary to attain the object of the catalogue.\r\nIf the latter includes only the more conspicuous stars, it is common\r\nto add the name of each star that has one; if none is recognized, the\r\nconstellation to which the star belongs is frequently given.\r\n\r\nThe position of a star on the celestial sphere is defined by its\r\nright ascension and declination. These correspond to the longitude\r\nand latitude of places on the earth, in the following way: Imagine a\r\nplane passing through the center of the earth and coinciding with its\r\nequator, to extend out so as to intersect the celestial sphere. The\r\nline of intersection will be a great circle of the celestial sphere,\r\ncalled the celestial equator. The axis of the earth, being also\r\nindefinitely extended in both the north and the south directions, will\r\nmeet the celestial spheres in two opposite points, known as the north\r\nand south celestial poles. The equator will then be a great circle 90°\r\nfrom each pole. Then as meridians are drawn from pole to pole on the\r\nearth, cutting the equator at different points, so imaginary meridians\r\nare conceived as drawn from pole to pole on the celestial sphere.\r\nCorresponding to parallels of latitude on the earth we have parallels\r\nof declination on the celestial sphere. These are parallel to the\r\nequator, and become smaller and smaller as we approach either pole. The\r\ncorrespondence of the terrestrial and celestial circles is this:\r\n\r\nTo _latitude_ on the earth’s surface corresponds _declination_ in the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nTo _longitude_ on the earth corresponds _right ascension_ in the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nA little study of these facts will show that the zenith of any point on\r\nthe earth’s surface is always in a declination equal to the latitude\r\nof the place. For example, for an observer in Philadelphia, in 40°\r\nlatitude, the parallel of 40° north declination will always pass\r\nthrough his zenith, and a star of that declination will, in the course\r\nof its diurnal motion, also pass through his zenith.\r\n\r\nSo also to an observer on the equator the celestial sphere always spans\r\nthe visible celestial hemisphere through the east and west points.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the right ascension, the relation between the\r\nterrestrial and celestial spheres is not constant, because of the\r\ndiurnal motion, which keeps the terrestrial meridians in constant\r\nrevolution relative to the celestial meridians. Allowing for this\r\nmotion, however, the system is the same. As we have on the earth’s\r\nsurface a prime meridian passing from pole to pole through the\r\nGreenwich Observatory, so in the heavens a prime meridian passes from\r\none celestial pole to the other through the vernal equinox. Then to\r\ndefine the right ascension of any star we imagine a great circle\r\npassing from pole to pole through the star, as we imagine one to pass\r\nfrom pole to pole through a city on the earth of which we wish to\r\ndesignate the longitude. The actual angle which this meridian makes\r\nwith the prime meridian is the right ascension of the star as it is the\r\nlongitude of the place on the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a difference in the unit of angular measurement\r\ncommonly used for right ascensions in the heavens and longitude on the\r\nearth. In astronomical practice, right ascension is very generally\r\nexpressed by hours, twenty-four of which make a complete circle,\r\ncorresponding to the apparent revolution of the celestial sphere in\r\ntwenty-four hours. The reason of this is that astronomers determine\r\nright ascension by the time shown by a clock so regulated as to read 0\r\nhrs., 0 min., 0 sec. when the vernal equinox crosses the meridian. The\r\nhour hand of this clock makes a revolution through twenty-four hours\r\nduring the time that the earth makes one revolution on its axis, and\r\nthus returns to 0 hrs., 0 min., 0 sec. when the vernal equinox again\r\ncrosses the meridian. A clock thus regulated is said to show sidereal\r\ntime. Then the right ascension of any star is equal to the sidereal\r\ntime at which it crosses the meridian of any point on the earth’s\r\nsurface. Right ascension thus designated in time may be changed to\r\ndegrees and minutes by multiplying by 15. Thus, one hour is equal to\r\n15°; one minute of time is equal to 15′ of arc, and one second of time\r\nto 1″ of arc.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that in astronomical practice terrestrial longitudes\r\nare also expressed in time, the longitude of a place being designated\r\nby the number of hours it may be east or west of Greenwich. Thus,\r\nWashington is said to be 5h. 8m. 15s. west of Greenwich. This, however,\r\nis not important for our present purpose.\r\n\r\nThe first astronomer who attempted to make a catalogue of all the known\r\nstars is supposed to be Hipparchus, who flourished about 150 B.C. There\r\nis an unverified tradition to the effect that he undertook this work\r\nin consequence of the appearance of a new star in the heavens, and a\r\ndesire to leave on record, for the use of posterity, such information\r\nrespecting the heavens in his time that any changes which might take\r\nplace in them could be detected. This catalogue has not come down to\r\nus--at least not in its original form.\r\n\r\nPtolemy, the celebrated author of the ‘Almagest,’ flourished A.D.\r\n150. His great work contains the earliest catalogue of stars which\r\nwe have. There seems to be a certain probability that this catalogue\r\neither may be that of Hipparchus adopted by Ptolemy unchanged, or may\r\nbe largely derived from Hipparchus. This, however, is little more than\r\na surmise, due to the fact that Ptolemy does not seem to have been a\r\ngreat observer, but based his theories very largely on the observations\r\nof his predecessors. The actual number of stars which it contains is\r\n1,030. The positions of these are given in longitude and latitude, and\r\nare also described by their places in the figure of the constellation\r\nto which each may belong. Not unfrequently the longitude or latitude is\r\na degree or more in error, showing that the instruments with which the\r\nposition was determined were of rather rough construction.\r\n\r\nSo far as the writer is aware, no attempt to make a new catalogue of\r\nthe stars is found until the tenth century. Then arose the Persian\r\nastronomer, Abd-Al-Rahman Al-Sufi, commonly known as Al-Sufi, who was\r\nborn A.D. 903 and lived until 986. Nothing is known of his life except\r\nthat he was a man celebrated for his learning, especially in astronomy.\r\nHis only work on the latter subject which has come down to us is a\r\ndescription of the fixed stars, which was translated from the Arabic\r\nby Schjellerup and published in 1874 by the St. Petersburg Academy of\r\nScience. This work is based mainly on the catalogue of Ptolemy, all\r\nthe stars of which he claimed to have carefully examined. But he did\r\nnot add any new stars to Ptolemy’s list, nor, it would seem, did he\r\nattempt to redetermine their positions. He simply used the longitudes\r\nand latitudes of Ptolemy, the former being increased by 12° 42′ on\r\naccount of the precession during the interval between his time and\r\nthat to which Ptolemy’s catalogue was reduced. The translator says of\r\nhis work that it gives a description of the starry heavens at the time\r\nof the author and is worthy of the highest confidence. The main body\r\nof the work consists of a detailed description of each constellation,\r\nmentioning the positions and appearances of the stars which it\r\ncontains. Here we find the Arabic names of the stars, which were not,\r\nhowever, used as proper names, but seem rather to have been Arabic\r\nwords representing some real or supposed peculiarity of the separate\r\nstars, or arbitrarily applied to them.\r\n\r\nFour centuries later arose the celebrated Ulugh Beigh, grandson of\r\nTamerlane, who reigned at Samarcand in the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. Bailey says of him: “Ulugh Beigh was not only a warlike and\r\npowerful monarch, but also an eminent promoter of the sciences and\r\nof learned men. During his father’s lifetime he had attracted to his\r\ncapital all the most celebrated astronomers from different parts of\r\nthe world; he erected there an immense college and observatory, in\r\nwhich above a hundred persons were constantly occupied in the pursuits\r\nof science, and caused instruments to be constructed of a better form\r\nand greater dimensions than any that had hitherto been used for making\r\nastronomical observations.”\r\n\r\nHis fate was one which so enlightened a promoter of learning little\r\ndeserved; he was assassinated by the order of his own son, who desired\r\nto succeed him on his throne; and in order to make his position the\r\nmore secure, also put his only brother to death. A catalogue of the\r\nstars bears the name of this monarch; he is supposed to have made many\r\nor most of the observations on which it is founded. Posterity will\r\nbe likely to suppose that a sovereign used the eyes of others more\r\nthan his own in making the observations. However this may be, his\r\ncatalogue seems to have been the first in which the positions of the\r\nstars given by Ptolemy were carefully revised. He found that there\r\nwere twenty-seven of Ptolemy’s stars too far south to be visible at\r\nSamarcand, and that eight others, although diligently looked after,\r\ncould not be discovered. It is curious that, like Al-Sufi, he does not\r\nseem to have added any new stars to Ptolemy’s list.\r\n\r\nNext in the order of time comes the work of Bayer, whose method of\r\nnaming the stars has already been described. The main feature of this\r\nwork consists of maps of all the constellations. Previous to his time,\r\ncelestial globes, made especially for the use of the navigator, took\r\nthe place of maps of the stars. The first edition of this book was\r\npublished in 1603, and is distinguished by the fact that a list of\r\nstars in each constellation is printed on the backs of the maps. Bayer\r\ndid not confine himself to the northern hemisphere, but extended his\r\nlist over the whole celestial sphere, from the north to the south pole.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue of the celebrated Tycho Brahe, prepared toward the end of\r\nthe sixteenth century, though of great historic value, is of no special\r\ninterest to the general reader at the present time. A supplement to\r\nit, continuing its list of stars to the south pole, was published by\r\nHalley, who made the necessary observations during a journey to St.\r\nHelena in 1677.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue of Hevelius, published in 1690, offers no feature of\r\nspecial interest, except the addition of several new constellations\r\nwhich he placed between those already known. Having the aid of the\r\ntelescope, he was able to include in his catalogue stars which had been\r\ninvisible to his predecessors.\r\n\r\nModern catalogues of the stars may be divided into two classes:\r\nThose which include only stars of a special class, or stars of which\r\nthe observer sought to determine the position or magnitude with all\r\nattainable precision; and catalogues intended to include all the\r\nstars in any given region of the heavens, down to some fixed order of\r\nmagnitude. It may appear remarkable that no attempt of the latter sort\r\nwas seriously made until more than two centuries after the telescope\r\nhad been pointed at the heavens by Galileo. A reason for the absence\r\nof such an attempt will be seen in the vast number of stars shown by\r\nthe telescope, the difficulty of stopping at any given point, and the\r\nseeming impossibility of assigning positions to hundreds of thousands\r\nof stars. The latter difficulty was overcome by the improved methods of\r\nobservation devised in modern times.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the present century the celebrated Argelander\r\ncommenced the work of actually cataloguing all the stars of the\r\nnorthern celestial hemisphere to magnitude 9½. This work was termed\r\na _Durchmusterung_ of the northern heavens, a term which has been\r\nintroduced into astronomy generally to designate a catalogue in which\r\nall the stars down to a certain magnitude are supposed to be mustered,\r\nas if a census of them were taken. The work fills three quarto volumes\r\nand contains more than 310,000 stars, of each of which the magnitude\r\nand the right ascension and declination are given. This work was\r\nextended by Schönfeld, Argelander’s assistant and successor, to 22° of\r\nsouth declination.\r\n\r\nIn the latitudes in which most of the great observatories of the\r\nworld are situated, that part of the celestial sphere within 40° or\r\n50° of the south pole always remains below the horizon. Around this\r\ninvisible region a belt of somewhat indefinite breadth, 10° or more,\r\ncan be only imperfectly observed, owing to the nearness of the stars\r\nto the horizon, and the brevity of the period between their rising\r\nand setting. Up to the middle of the nineteenth century, the few\r\nobservatories situated in the southern hemisphere were too ill-endowed\r\nto permit of their undertaking a complete census of this invisible\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nThe first considerable work emanating from the Cordoba Observatory,\r\nunder Gould, was a catalogue of all the stars from the south pole\r\nto 10° of north declination which could be seen with the naked eye.\r\nAnother work, which was not issued until after Dr. Gould’s death, was\r\ndevoted to photographs of southern clusters of stars.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Cordoba Observatory, with which we are more especially\r\nconcerned in the present connection, consists of a ‘Durchmusterung’ of\r\nthe southern heavens, commencing at 22° of south declination, where\r\nSchönfeld’s work ended, and continued to the south pole. This work\r\nis still incomplete, but two volumes have been published by Thome,\r\nextending to 41° of south declination. It is expected that the third is\r\napproaching completion. This catalogue is, in one point at least, more\r\ncomplete than that of Argelander and Schönfeld, as it contains all the\r\nstars down to the tenth magnitude. The two volumes give the positions\r\nand magnitudes of no less than 340,000 stars, and therefore more than\r\nthe catalogue of Argelander gives for the entire northern hemisphere.\r\nIf the remaining part of the heavens, from 42° to the south pole, is\r\nequally rich, it will contain nearly half a million stars, and the\r\nentire work will comprise more than 800,000 stars.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Observatory of the Cape of Good Hope, under the able and\r\nenergetic direction of Dr. David Gill, has undertaken a work of the\r\nsame kind, which is remarkable for being based on photography. The\r\nhistory of this work is of great interest. In 1882 Gill secured the\r\naid of photographers at the Cape of Good Hope to take pictures of\r\nthe brilliant comet of that year, with a large camera. On developing\r\nthe pictures the remarkable discovery was made that not only all the\r\nstars visible to the naked eye, but telescopic stars down to the ninth\r\nor tenth magnitude were also found on the negatives. This remarkable\r\nresult suggested to Gill that here was a new and simple method of\r\ncataloguing the stars. It was only necessary to photograph the heavens\r\nand then measure the positions of the stars on the glass negatives,\r\nwhich could be done with much greater ease and certainty than measures\r\ncould be made on the positions of the actual stars, which were in\r\nconstant apparent motion.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the necessary arrangements could be made and the apparatus\r\nput into successful operation, Gill proceeded to the work of\r\nphotographing the entire southern heavens from 18° of south declination\r\nto the celestial pole. The results of this work are found in the ‘Cape\r\nPhotographic Durchmusterung,’ a work in three quarto volumes, in which\r\nthe astronomers of all future time will find a permanent record of the\r\nsouthern heavens towards the end of the nineteenth century. The actual\r\nwork of taking the photographs extended from 1887 to 1891. This,\r\nhowever, was far from being the most difficult part of the enterprise.\r\nThe most arduous task of measuring the positions of a half-million of\r\nstars on the negatives, including the determining of the magnitude of\r\neach, was undertaken by Professor J. C. Kapetyn, of the University of\r\nGroningen, Holland, and brought to a successful completion in the year\r\n1899.\r\n\r\nWhat the work gives is, in the first place, the magnitude and\r\napproximate position of every star photographed. The determining of\r\nthe magnitude of a star is an important and delicate question. There\r\nis no difficulty in determining, from the diameter of the image of the\r\nstar as seen in the microscope, what its photographic magnitude was\r\nat the time of the exposure, as compared with other stars on the same\r\nplate. But can we rely upon similar photographic magnitudes on a plate\r\ncorresponding to similar brightnesses of the stars? In the opinion of\r\nGill and Kapetyn we cannot. The transparency of the air varies from\r\nnight to night, and on a very clear night the same star will give a\r\nstronger image than it will when the air is thick. Besides, slightly\r\ndifferent instruments were used in the course of the work. For these\r\nreasons a scale of magnitude was determined on each plate by comparing\r\nthe photographic intensity of the images of a number of stars with the\r\nmagnitudes as observed with the eye by various observers. Thus on each\r\nplate the magnitude was reduced to a visual scale.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow from this that the magnitudes are visual, and not\r\nphotographic. It is still true that a blue star will give a much\r\nstronger photographic image than a red star of equal visual brightness.\r\nIn a general way, it may be said that the catalogue includes all the\r\nstars to very nearly the tenth magnitude, and on most of the plates\r\nstars of 10.5 were included. In fact, now and then is found a star of\r\nthe eleventh magnitude.\r\n\r\nA feature of the work which adds greatly to its value is a careful\r\nand exhaustive comparison of its results with previous catalogues of\r\nthe stars. When a star is found in any other catalogue the latter is\r\nindicated. Most interesting is a complete list of catalogued stars\r\nwhich ought to be on the photographic negatives, but were not found\r\nthere. Every such case was inexhaustibly investigated. Sometimes the\r\nstar was variable, sometimes it was so red in color that it failed\r\nto impress itself on the plate, sometimes there were errors in the\r\ncatalogue.\r\n\r\nThe great enterprise of making a photographic map of the heavens\r\nnow being carried on as an international enterprise, having its\r\nheadquarters at Paris, is yet wider in its scope than the works we\r\nhave just described. One point of difference is that it is intended to\r\ninclude all the stars, however faint, that admit of being photographed\r\nwith the instruments in use. The latter are constructed on a uniform\r\nplan, the aperture of each being 34 centimetres, or 13.4 inches, and\r\nthe focal length 343 cm. Two sets of plates are taken, one to include\r\nall the stars that the instrument will photograph near poles, and the\r\nother only to take in those to the eleventh magnitude. Of the latter\r\nit is intended to prepare a catalogue. Some portions of the German and\r\nEnglish catalogues have already been published, and their results will\r\nbe made use of in the course of the present work.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBERING THE STARS.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the work of cataloguing the stars is that of\r\nenumerating them. In view of what may possibly be associated with\r\nany one star--planets with intellectual beings inhabiting them--the\r\nquestion how many stars there are in the heavens is one of perennial\r\ninterest. But beyond the general statement we have already made, this\r\nquestion does not admit of even an approximate answer. The question\r\nwhich we should be able to answer is this: How many stars are there\r\nof each easily visible magnitude? How many of the first magnitude, of\r\nthe second, of the third, and so on to the smallest that have been\r\nmeasured? Even in this form we cannot answer the question in a way\r\nwhich is at the same time precise and satisfactory. One magnitude\r\nmerges into another by insensible gradations, so that no two observers\r\nwill agree as to where the line should be drawn between them. The\r\ndifficulty is enhanced by the modern system--very necessary, it is\r\ntrue--of regarding magnitude as a continuously varying quantity and\r\nestimating it with all possible precision. In adjusting the new system\r\nto the old one, it may be assumed that an average star of any given\r\nmagnitude on the old system would be designated by the corresponding\r\nnumber on the new system. For example, an average star of the fourth\r\nmagnitude would be called 4.0; one of the fifth, 5.0, etc. Then the\r\nbrightest stars, which formerly were called of the fourth magnitude,\r\nwould now be, if the estimate were carried to hundredths, 3.50, while\r\nthe faintest would be 4.50. What were formerly called stars of the\r\nfifth magnitude would range from 4.50 to 5.50, and so on. But we have\r\nmeet with a difficulty when we come to the sixth magnitude. On the\r\nmodern system, magnitude 6.0 represents the faintest star visible to\r\nthe naked eye; but the stars formerly included in this class would,\r\non the average, be somewhat brighter than this, because none could be\r\ncatalogued except those so visible.\r\n\r\nThe most complete enumeration of the lucid stars by magnitudes has been\r\nmade by Pickering (‘Annals of the Harvard Observatory,’ Vol. XIV). The\r\nstars were classified by half magnitudes, calling\r\n\r\n                     M.      M.\r\n  Mag. 2.0 all from 1.75 to 2.25\r\n       2.5 all from 2.25 to 2.75\r\n       etc.,             etc.\r\n\r\nFor the northern stars Pickering used the Harvard Photometry; for the\r\nsouthern, Gould’s ‘Uranometria Argentina.’ A zone from the equator to\r\n30° south declination is common to both; for this zone I use Gould.\r\nThe number of each class in the entire sky, north and south of the\r\ncelestial equator, is as follows:\r\n\r\n            Northern     Southern\r\n           Hemisphere.  Hemisphere.\r\n            Pickering.     Gould.     Total.\r\n\r\n  1±              9          14          23\r\n  2.0            17          15          32\r\n  2.5            17          24          41\r\n  3.0            37          41          78\r\n  3.5            61          74         135\r\n  4.0           114         126         240\r\n  4.5           228         234         462\r\n  5.0           450         426         876\r\n  5.5           787         681       1,468\r\n  6.0           789       1,189       1,978\r\n              -----       -----       -----\r\n  Sum.        2,509       2,824       5,333\r\n\r\nIt would seem from this that the number of lucid stars in the southern\r\ncelestial hemisphere is 315 greater than in the northern. But this\r\narises wholly from a seemingly greater number of stars of magnitude 6.\r\nIn the zone 0° to 30° S., Pickering has 214 stars of this class fewer\r\nthan Gould. Hence it is not likely that there is any really greater\r\nrichness of the southern sky.\r\n\r\nThe total number of lucid stars is thus found to be 5,333. But it is\r\nnot likely that stars of magnitudes 6.1 and 6.2 should be included in\r\nthis class, though this is done in the above table. From a careful\r\nstudy and comparison of the same data from Pickering and Gould,\r\nSchiaparelli enumerated the stars to magnitude 6.0. He found:\r\n\r\n  North pole to 30° S.     3,113 stars.\r\n  30° S. to south pole     1,190 stars.\r\n                           -----\r\n     Total lucid stars     4,303\r\n\r\nFor most purposes a classification by entire magnitudes is more\r\ninstructive than one by half magnitudes. From the third magnitude\r\ndownward we may assume that 40 per cent. of the stars of each half\r\nmagnitude belong to the magnitude next above, and 60 per cent. to that\r\nnext below. We thus find that of\r\n\r\n                                        Total.\r\n  Mag. 0 and 1 there are 21 stars          21\r\n  Mag. 2 there are       52 stars          73\r\n  Mag. 3 there are      157 stars         230\r\n  Mag. 4 there are      506 stars         736\r\n  Mag. 5 there are    1,740 stars       2,476\r\n  Mag. 6 there are    5,171 stars       7,647\r\n\r\nHere it is to be remarked that under magnitude 6 are included many\r\nother than the lucid stars, namely, all down to magnitude 6.4. The last\r\ncolumn gives the entire number of stars down to each order of magnitude.\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked that the number of stars of each order is rather\r\nmore than three times that of the order next higher. How far does this\r\nlaw extend? Argelander’s ‘Durchmusterung,’ which is supposed to include\r\nall stars to magnitude 9.5, gives 315,039 stars for the northern\r\nhemisphere, from which it would be inferred that the whole sky contains\r\n630,000 stars to the ninth magnitude. Comparing this with the number\r\n7,647 of stars to the magnitude 6.5, we see that it is forty-fold, so\r\nthat it would require a ratio of about 3.5 from each magnitude to the\r\nnext lower. But it is now found that Argelander’s list contains, in the\r\ngreater part of the heavens, all the stars to the tenth magnitude.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Thome’s Cordoba ‘Durchmusterung’ gives 340,380 stars\r\nbetween the parallels -22° and -42°. This is 0.14725 of the whole sky,\r\nso that, on Thome’s scale of magnitude, there are about 2,311,000 stars\r\nto the tenth magnitude in the sky. This is more than three times the\r\nArgelander number to the ninth magnitude.\r\n\r\nIt would, therefore, seem that the ratio of number for each magnitude\r\nmust exceed 3, even up to the tenth. If a ratio of only 3 extends four\r\nsteps farther, the whole number of stars in the sky down to magnitude\r\n14.5 inclusive must approach 200 millions. Until the international\r\nphotographic chart of the sky is subjected to a detailed examination,\r\nit is impossible to make an estimation with any approach to certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONIES AND THE MOTHER COUNTRY (III).\r\n\r\nBY JAMES COLLIER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relations between a great state and its subject peoples will vary\r\naccording to the status of these, as the relations between father and\r\nson differ according as the latter is self-supporting or still under\r\ntutelage. Roman provinces under the empire were classed as imperial\r\nwhen they were directly controlled by the Emperor, or senatorial\r\nwhen they were governed by the Senate and possessed a simulacrum of\r\nself-government. The dual status in this mother country of nearly\r\nthe whole world foreshadows all subsequent relationships between a\r\nmother country and its dependencies. Spain and Portugal governed their\r\ncolonies imperially, appointing all officers, immediately or through\r\ntheir representative mediately enacting all laws, and leaving almost\r\nas little freedom to their own countrymen as to the down-trodden\r\nindigenes. More humanely, indeed, but in spite of conceded French\r\ncitizenship and theoretical equality, the French have ruled their\r\nscattered dependencies with as little of the reality of public life.\r\nThe Dutch colonies are similarly controlled. The British Empire\r\npresents a variegated picture where every color is blended and every\r\nform of policy known among men is displayed. From it alone an Aristotle\r\nmight delineate the metaphysics of government or a Spencer construct\r\nits physics. In Egypt and Crete, with practical possession, imperial\r\nEngland is vassal to the Sultan, and she now holds the conquered\r\nSoudan jointly with Egypt, but acknowledges no suzerainty. She is\r\nherself suzerain of the two South African Boer republics and regent of\r\nZanzibar. In her magnificent dependency of India, 692 sovereignties and\r\nchiefships form a ‘protected’ girdle around her own possessions, or\r\ninterlace or approach them. Between these beneficent despotisms and the\r\nfree states of Australia, South Africa or North America there seems to\r\nbe every possible variety of mingled absolutism and self-government.\r\nCertain territories are governed by chartered companies; one (Rhodesia)\r\nby a chartered company under the control of the Crown. Three native\r\nterritories are governed by officers under the High Commissioner of\r\nSouth Africa; four others by the officers of Cape Colony. The status\r\nof Crown colonies administered more or less directly by the Imperial\r\nGovernment is almost as various. One colony may be dependent on\r\nanother, as Natal was for years on Cape Colony. Others exhibit in an\r\nascending scale the acquisition of the attributes of self-government.\r\nThe governor rules at first alone despotically, then with an executive\r\ncouncil, next with a nominated legislative council, further with the\r\nlatter partly elected, and finally with it wholly elective. At these\r\nsuccessive stages the colony is in a decreasing degree under the\r\ncontrol of the Imperial Government, and a scale might be drawn showing\r\ngroups of colonies indefinitely arrested at one or another of them.\r\nOnly colonies destined for complete freedom victoriously pass through\r\nthem all and emerge into full political manhood.\r\n\r\nThe duration of their infancy and youth is determined by internal and\r\nexternal circumstances: (1) When a colony is systematically founded\r\nand quickly peopled it may rapidly traverse the period of dependence,\r\nand (like New Zealand or South Australia) be granted responsible\r\ngovernment in about fifteen years. (2) Convict colonies, like Tasmania\r\nand New South Wales, may have fifty or sixty years of pupilage. (3) A\r\ncolony of retarded growth, like West Australia, may be nearly as long\r\na minor. (4) Colonies that have long to struggle with an overwhelming\r\nmass of indigenes, like Cape Colony, may take half a century to ripen,\r\nand even then, like Natal, may retain traces of the earlier state. (5)\r\nWhen the mother country is herself despotically governed, as England\r\nwas under the Stuarts, the Commonwealth and the early Hanoverians,\r\ncolonies that possess every attribute qualifying them for freedom,\r\nlike many of the North American colonies, may be forcibly retained in\r\npartial dependence. (6) The New England colonies, free from the start,\r\nwere connected with Britain by a shadowy tie of nominal allegiance,\r\ntightened at times into real subjection. Lastly, a colony may revert,\r\nlike Jamaica, after years of Parliamentary institutions, to the\r\ndependent position of a Crown colony.\r\n\r\nSo various and so intricate, so weak here, so strong there, and withal\r\nso marvelously compacted, is the network of relations forming the\r\nanatomy of the wonderful new type of social organism constituted by a\r\nmother country, its free and its subject colonies, its protected states\r\nand its dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe brain sometimes inhibits natural movements and enforces injurious\r\nactions, as a morbid conscience often prescribes irksome duties and\r\nforbids innocent pleasures. Fathers have misdirected the career of\r\ntheir sons, and the unwisdom of mothers (Lady Ashton, in ‘The Bride of\r\nLammermoor,’ is a tragic, but far from a rare example) has destroyed\r\nthe happiness of their daughters. So governments inevitably hinder and\r\nblunder, worry colonies by vexatious interferences or goad them into\r\ninsurrection. For more than thirty years Bishop Fonseca, the president\r\nof the Council of the Indies, lay like an incubus on the Spanish\r\ncolonies in South America. His main object seemed to be to throw\r\nimpediments in the way of the great discoverers and rulers--Columbus\r\nand Cortez. When Cortez planned the conquest of Mexico he experienced\r\nprotracted opposition from Fonseca, who “discouraged recruits,\r\nstopped supplies and sequestered the property” Cortez sent to Spain.\r\nThe conqueror bitterly complained that he “had found it harder to\r\ncontend against his own countrymen than against the Aztecs.” The story\r\nof Spain’s South American colonies is one of injustice, oppression\r\nand downright robbery. The natives naturally suffered most. They were\r\ncondemned to forced labor in the mines under circumstances of extreme\r\nbarbarity, in order that large sums of money might be sent annually\r\nto Spain. This insatiable demand neutralized all the efforts of the\r\nbest-intentioned viceroys and rendered all attempts at good government\r\nnugatory. The Indians had further to submit to grinding oppression by\r\nthe local officials and to the exactions and tyranny of the priests.\r\nThe Spanish colonists had their own grievances. Articles of commerce\r\nwere excluded, or had their prices heightened by the monopoly of the\r\nCadiz merchants. They were oppressed by the military despotism of\r\nthe government. The political development of the colonies was made\r\nimpossible by the continued use of them for the purposes of the mother\r\ncountry. What Spain was for three centuries, that was she till the\r\nother day in her few remaining colonies. Lord Brassey writes of Cuba:\r\n“The casual visitor can not fail to be impressed with the evidences of\r\ninefficient administration. The fiscal policy is intensely exclusive.\r\nThe taxation is heavy, and the government absolutely despotic. The\r\npolice maintain a system of intolerable espionage. Every salaried\r\nservant of the local government is a Spaniard, who regards Cuba as a\r\nvassal state, over which Spain has unlimited rights, without reciprocal\r\nduties or obligations. The system has already severed all her noble\r\nsettlements in South America from the mother country. In time it must\r\ninvolve the loss of Cuba.”\r\n\r\nIf it were the case that the genesis and growth of the myriad buds\r\nformed round a prolific hydroid were accelerated by magnetic shoots\r\n(so to speak) from the parent zoöphyte, and ‘persons’ were thus\r\ndifferentiated, we should have a true analogue to a kind of action\r\nexercised by the mother country on its colonies. For it long supplies\r\nthem with the greater part of their brain power, governing force,\r\nculture, science and experience of all sorts, and when these have\r\ndone their work a new political, intellectual and moral center is\r\ncreated, which is henceforth self-subsistent; the colony has received a\r\nsoul, a mind, a heart. First, the governor is usually sent out by the\r\nmetropolis. Of six hundred and seventy-two rulers of South America,\r\nfrom its conquest to its independence, only eighteen were Americans.\r\nIn French and Dutch colonies there are possibly no exceptions. Many\r\nof the charter and proprietary colonies of North America elected\r\ntheir own governors, and the insurrectionary governor of a Crown\r\ncolony, New York, was popularly elected. The lieutenant-governors\r\nof the provinces of the Canadian Dominion are locally appointed.\r\nWith these and one or two other exceptions, the governor may be\r\nconsidered as symbolizing (in so far as he has the capacity) the entire\r\ncivilization of the mother country. He brings much or little to the\r\ncolony he comes to govern. Sometimes, as in the case of Sir George\r\nGray, he brings intellectual superiority, and he may thus stimulate\r\nits literary development, but that is rare. He oftener imparts an\r\naroma of gentility that is much appreciated by a certain class. He\r\nmay be of practical utility by applying the experience of a military\r\nengineer, as did Sir William Jervois. He may have had large colonial\r\nexperience, like Sir Hercules Robinson, and use that to solve the\r\nintricate political problems of his colony. If he is a collector, like\r\nSir George Gray, he may enrich it by bequests of libraries and museums.\r\nIf he possesses literary gifts and has passed through an eventful time,\r\nhe may enrich colonial history by dictating his biography, like one\r\ncolonial governor, or writing his reminiscences, like so many. And\r\nlastly, after returning to the mother-land, he may continue to watch\r\nover the interests of the colony or colonies he ruled; he may become\r\npresident or member of the Council of the Indies, like three viceroys\r\nof Peru, or Parliamentary under-secretary for the colonies, like Sir\r\nJames Fergusson, or even his former colony’s agent-general, like Sir\r\nW. Robinson. In Crown colonies the chief legal and administrative\r\nofficials are imperial appointees, and are only superseded by local\r\nministers when the colony is granted responsible government. In\r\na unique case, that of Queensland, after a constitution had been\r\nconceded, the first governor took out with him the first premier; and\r\nhe too was afterwards able to safeguard its interests as permanent\r\nunder-secretary in London.\r\n\r\nThe Greek metropolis sometimes sent priests to its colonies, and\r\nbishops are long appointed by the mother church. During the three\r\ncenturies of Peruvian dependence fully one in seven bishops--one\r\nhundred and five against seven hundred and six--were native Americans.\r\nCanada seems to have at length arrived at complete independence and\r\nappoints Canadians. In Australasia and South Africa the metropolitans\r\nand most of the suffragans are still nominated in England; a dean may\r\nbe transferred from one colony to another as a bishop; or a small and\r\npoor diocese may elect one of its incumbents. Local jealousies and\r\npossibly the absence of a commanding spirit combine with the desire\r\nto have the best the home church can afford to give or the colonial\r\nchurch procure to dictate the extraneous selection. The stream of\r\necclesiastical culture flows likewise through the immigration or\r\nimportation of ministers of all denominations. It means, among\r\nCatholics as among Protestants, the periodical addition to the\r\nspiritual wealth of the colonies of an amount of talent and high\r\ncharacter which they would have been slow to acquire by natural growth.\r\nUniversity or collegiate professors are for quite as long appointed\r\nby a committee of selection in the mother country. Such men--some\r\nof them brilliant, laborious, enthusiastic--are a real acquisition\r\nto communities immersed in material pursuits and cut off from the\r\nmovement of science in Europe, and their position is deservedly high\r\nand well remunerated. Doctors, lawyers, artists, teachers, experts in\r\nmany departments, place the colonies in the same position relatively\r\nto less-favored communities, as the sons of a squire relatively to\r\nthe sons of an artisan. In this respect, as in most others, a colony\r\nfollows the example of the mother country. The introduction of\r\nliterature, the sciences and the arts into the mother-land was to a\r\nlarge extent at all stages in its history the work of aliens. It is so\r\nstill; the names of Bunsen, Rosen, Max Müller, Goldstücker, Aufrecht,\r\nand a score of others, are proofs that men as well as things that are\r\n‘made in Germany’ are still imported into England. To descend to the\r\nmechanical arts, “the ranks of skilled workmen in America were and\r\nare renewed from the more fertile soil of Europe”; even the workmen\r\nin the Portland stone-quarries are imported from England. The second\r\nmode in which foreign culture was introduced into the mother-land\r\nin common with all others--visits made abroad for discipleship or\r\ninstruction--has all along been, and is now increasingly, maintained.\r\nColonial students go to Europe to be trained in medicine and law.\r\nExperts go to become acquainted with advances in science and medicine,\r\nor with recent improvements in mechanical processes. The wealthier\r\ncolonists who spend occasional seasons in Europe bring back new (or\r\nantiquated) social or political notions, and Americans who thus try\r\nto import into the United States an aristocratic style of living have\r\nto be ridiculed out of it. The third method by which an infusion of\r\nforeign civilization may pass into another community is by books, works\r\nof plastic art, music, tools, implements and instruments, and into\r\nthis vast inheritance of the mother country the daughter colonies have\r\nentered. They participate in the advances made by other countries as\r\nwell. The Canadian colonies owe only less to the United States than\r\nto England, and American railway cars, agricultural implements and\r\nhousehold utensils are in use in Australasia. In New Zealand a French\r\nMasonic lodge has struck root.\r\n\r\nThe new colonial centers thus formed react on the father-land, as we\r\nmay conceive the daughter buds to react on the parent hydroid. The\r\ndiscovery of the New World and the successive entrance of the five\r\ngreat maritime powers upon a long and fierce rivalry for its possession\r\ntransformed the politics of Europe. Great wars were undertaken solely\r\nwith this object. The political center of gravity was shifted from the\r\nMediterranean to the Atlantic. New industrial interests were created.\r\nInsular and stagnant powers, isolated Continental powers, received a\r\nfresh lease of life, and, along with warlike Continental powers, were\r\nexpanded to the measure of the globe. New sympathies were generated.\r\nWider horizons were opened out. The heart and brain of all were in a\r\nmanner enlarged. The policy of the mother country is even now being\r\nmodified by its colonies. “The paramount object in legislating for\r\ncolonies should be the welfare of the parent state,” frankly avows the\r\nlaw officer of the Dutch East India Company at the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nin 1779. The Ashburton Treaty and the Oregon Agreement were entered\r\ninto as if England and the United States were alone interested in\r\ntheir provisions. Treaties are now concluded in the interests of the\r\ncolonies. Treaties are ‘denounced’ in order to allow them freedom to\r\ntax foreign commodities. They are represented by commissioners, on an\r\nequal footing with those of Britain, at conferences preparatory to the\r\nconclusion of treaties, and colonial conferences are summoned in order\r\nthat the general views of the colonies may be ascertained.\r\n\r\nThere is a more direct reaction, resembling the adoption by an\r\nadmiring father of the sentiments and opinions of a son who is rising\r\nin the world. The Greek cities that had planted colonies imitated\r\nthe republican institutions of these and deposed their kings. “The\r\nAmerican colonists,” says Bancroft, “founded their institutions on\r\npopular freedom and ‘set an example to the nations.’ Already the ...\r\nAnglo-Saxon emigrants were the hope of the world.” The filial free\r\ncolonies of Britain are exerting an influence on the domestic policy\r\nof the father-land. An aged colonial ruler used to console himself\r\nfor exclusion from the English Parliament by cherishing the belief\r\nthat ideas and measures of his had passed into the public life of\r\nEngland. Much of this is mere hallucination; some of it is reality. The\r\ntestimony of a sagacious and experienced statesman on this subject is\r\ndecisive:\r\n\r\n    “To the influence of the American Union must be added that of\r\n    the British colonies. The success of popular self-government in\r\n    these thriving communities is reacting on political opinion at\r\n    home with a force that no statesman neglects, and that is every\r\n    day increasing. There is even a danger that the influence may go\r\n    too far. They are solving some of our problems, but not under our\r\n    conditions, and not in presence of the same difficulties. Still,\r\n    the effect of colonial prosperity--a prosperity alike of admirable\r\n    achievement and boundless promise--is irresistible. It imparts a\r\n    freedom, an elasticity, an expansiveness, to English political\r\n    notions, and gives our people a confidence in free institutions and\r\n    popular government, which they would never have drawn from the most\r\n    eloquent assumptions of speculative system-mongers, nor from any\r\n    other source whatever, save practical experience carefully observed\r\n    and rationally interpreted.”[I]\r\n\r\n    [I] Morley, ‘Studies in Literature,’ pp. 126-7.\r\n\r\nThe New Zealand system of local government is a model which Great\r\nBritain, at one time famous in that line, has not been ashamed to\r\nimitate; the English county councils have been molded on those of her\r\ncolony. From the same colony the mother country borrowed her First\r\nOffenders’ act. The restriction of electors to the exercise of a\r\nsingle vote--unimportant excepting in principle in populous England,\r\nbut important in young countries where property is widely held--was\r\nperseveringly proposed, and at length carried, by the aristocratic\r\nleader of the democratic party in New Zealand, whence it is spreading\r\nto the adjacent colonies; it has been for some years adopted by the\r\nBritish Liberals as an article in their programme, and it is also a\r\nplank in the European socialist platform. The general adhesion to an\r\neight hours’ day in the Australasian colonies is having an effect in\r\nEngland and is probably the measure to which Mr. Morley refers as\r\nlikely to be dangerous; his opposition to it cost him his seat at\r\nNewcastle. The adoption of female suffrage in two of these colonies\r\nand the certainty of its adoption in others are habitually cited by\r\nthe advocates of the cause in England as an argument for its adoption\r\nin England. The nationalization of the land has been a popular notion\r\nin these same colonies ever since Henry George’s famous book was\r\npublished, and the large extent of private lands bought back by the\r\ngovernments of New Zealand and Queensland has strengthened the hands of\r\nthe land-nationalizers in Europe. The advanced government socialism of\r\nmost of these colonies, made inevitable by the lack of private capital,\r\nand its apparent success, furnish socialists of the German type with\r\nweapons and encourage them to prophesy ‘the dawn of a revolutionary\r\nepoch.’\r\n\r\nThe spiritual reaction of the colonies on the mother-land is much\r\nless considerable, yet is not nil. One or two instances stand out\r\nprominently. Jonathan Edwards is one of the giants of British as\r\nwell as of American theology, and his treatise on the freedom of the\r\nwill has counted for as much as Butler’s Analogy in the development\r\nof English theological thought. Sam Slick has been the father or\r\nfoster-father of the portentous overgrowth of humor by which the United\r\nStates balances the devouring activity of its public and the overstrain\r\nof its private life, but he has been practically inoperative on the\r\nvery different quality of English humor. From South Africa have come\r\ninfluences of a sterner sort. “Who could have foreseen,” asks Mr.\r\nStead, “that the new, and in many respects the most distinctive, note\r\nof the literature of the last decade of the nineteenth century would\r\nbe sounded by a little chit of a girl reared in the solemn stillness\r\nof the Karoo, in the solitude of the African bush? The Cape has indeed\r\ndone yeoman’s service to the English-speaking world. To that pivot of\r\nthe empire we owe our most pronounced types of the imperial man and the\r\nemancipated woman”--Cecil Rhodes and Olive Schreiner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF DEGENERATION IN BLIND FISHES.\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR CARL H. EIGENMANN,\r\n\r\nINDIANA UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may now be profitable to take up the causes leading to the small\r\ndegree of degeneration found in Chologaster, the degenerations of the\r\neye in Amblyopsis, Typhlichthys and Troglichthys to a mere vestige,\r\ntogether with the total disappearance of some of the accessory\r\nstructures of the eye, as the muscles.\r\n\r\nIn the outset of this consideration we must guard against the almost\r\nuniversal supposition that animals depending on their eyes for food are\r\nor have been colonizing caves, or that the blind forms are the results\r\nof catastrophes that have happened to eyed forms depending on their\r\neyesight for their existence. This idea, so prevalent, vitiates nearly\r\neverything that has been written on the degeneration of the eyes of\r\ncave animals.\r\n\r\nAnother word of warning ought perhaps to be added. The process of\r\ndegeneration found in the Amblyopsidæ need not necessarily be expected\r\nto be identical with the degeneration of the same organs in another\r\ngroup of animals, and, however much the conditions in one group may\r\nilluminate the conditions in another, cross-country conclusions must be\r\nguarded against.\r\n\r\nThe degeneration of organs ontogenetically and phylogenetically has\r\nreceived a variety of explanations:\r\n\r\n1. The organ diminishes with disuse (ontogenetic degeneration--Lamarck,\r\nRoux, Packard), and the effect of this disuse appears to some extent in\r\nthe next generation (phylogenetic degeneration--Lamarck, Roux, Packard,\r\nKohl).\r\n\r\n2. Through a condition of panmixia the general average maintained\r\nby selection is reduced to the birth mean in one generation\r\n(ontogenetic--Romanes, Lankester, Lloyd Morgan, Weismann) to\r\nthe greatest possible degeneration in succeeding generations\r\n(phylogenetic--Weismann), or but little below the birth average of the\r\nfirst generation (Weismann’s later view, Romanes, Morgan, Lankester).\r\n\r\n3. Through natural selection (reversed), the struggle of persons,\r\nthe organ may be caused to degenerate either (A) by the migration\r\nof persons with highly developed eyes from the colony living in the\r\ndark (Lankester), or (B) through economy of weight and nutriment or\r\nliability to injury (phylogenetic purely--Darwin, Romanes).\r\n\r\n4. Through the struggle of parts for room or for food an unused organ\r\nin the individual may be crowded (ontogenetic--Roux). This may lead\r\nto the development of the used organ as against the disused through a\r\ncompensation of growth (Goethe, Saint-Hilaire, Roux); this ontogenetic\r\nresult becomes phylogenetic through transmission of the acquired\r\ncharacter (Roux), or is in its very nature phyloblastic (Kohl).\r\n\r\n5. Through the struggle between soma and germ to produce the maximum\r\nof efficiency of the former with the minimum expenditure to the latter\r\n(ontogenetic and phylogenetic--Lendenfeld).\r\n\r\n6. Through germinal selection, the struggle of the representatives of\r\norgans in the germ (ontogenetic and phylogenetic--Weismann).\r\n\r\nThe idea of ontogenetic degeneration is intimately bound up with the\r\nidea of phylogenetic degeneration. Logically we ought to consider first\r\nthe causes of individual degeneration, and then the processes or causes\r\nthat led to the transmission of this. Practically it is impossible to\r\ndo so, because many of the explanations are general. Only No. 4 of\r\nthe above may be taken in the ontogenetic sense purely, though it was\r\ncertainly also meant to explain phylogenetic degeneration. In many of\r\nthe explanations of particular cases of degeneration more than one\r\nof the above principles are invoked, though only one was meant to be\r\nused. In most cases, however, the discussions of degeneration have\r\nbeen in general terms, without direct bearing on any specific instance\r\nof degeneration in all its details. It must be evident that such\r\ndiscussions can only by accident lead to right results.\r\n\r\nBy the Lamarckian ontogenetic degeneration is considered the result\r\nof lack of use and consequent diminished blood supply. The results of\r\nthe diminution caused by the lack of use during one generation are\r\ntransmitted in some degree to the next generation, which thus starts at\r\na lower level. A continuation of the same conditions leads finally to\r\nthe great reduction and ultimate disappearance of an organ.\r\n\r\nNo one, so far as I am aware, has succeeded in accounting for\r\nthe degeneration of the eye by means of this view. Packard’s[J]\r\nexplanations are evidently a mixture of Lamarckism and Darwinism.\r\n\r\n    [J] _American Naturalist_, September, 1894, vol. xxviii, p. 727.\r\n\r\nPackard says: “When a number, few or many, of normal-seeing animals\r\nenter a totally dark cave or stream, some may become blind sooner than\r\nothers,” some having the eye slightly modified by disuse, while others\r\nmay have in addition physical or functional defects, especially in the\r\noptic nerves and ganglia. “The result of the union of such individuals\r\nand adaptation to their Stygian life would be broods of young, some\r\nwith vision unimpaired, others with a tendency to blindness, while\r\nin others there would be noticed the first steps in degeneration of\r\nnervous power and nervous tissue.” Packard evidently had invertebrates\r\nin mind. He clearly admits the cessation of selection or panmixia in\r\nthat those born with defects may breed with the others. He supposes\r\nthat the blind fauna may have arisen in but few or several generations,\r\na supposition that may be applicable to invertebrates, but certainly is\r\nnot to vertebrates. At first those becoming so modified that they can\r\ndo without the use of their eyes would greatly preponderate over those\r\n‘congenitally blind.’ “So all the while the process of adaptation was\r\ngoing on, the antennæ and other tactile organs increasing in length\r\nand in the delicacy of structures, while the eyes were meanwhile\r\ndiminishing in strength of vision and their nervous force giving\r\nout, after a few generations--perhaps only two or three--the number\r\nof congenitally blind would increase, and eventually they would, in\r\ntheir turn, preponderate in numbers.” Packard seems here to admit the\r\nprinciple of degeneration as the result of compensation of growth, the\r\nnervous force of the eye giving out with the increase of the tactile\r\nand olfactory organs. It is somewhat doubtful in what sense the term\r\n‘congenitally blind’ is used, but it probably means born blind as\r\nthe result of transmitted disuse, rather than blind as the result of\r\nfortuitous variation. The effects of disuse are thus supposed, through\r\ntheir transmission, to have given rise to generations of blind animals.\r\nThe continued degeneration is not discussed.\r\n\r\nRomanes maintained that the beginning of degeneration was due to\r\ncessation of selection, and continued degeneration to the reversal\r\nof selection and final failing of the power of heredity. Selection\r\nhe supposed to be reversed because the organ no longer of use “is\r\nabsorbing nutriment, causing weight, occupying space and so on,\r\nuselessly. Hence, even if it be not also a source of actual danger,\r\neconomy of growth will determine a reversal of selection against an\r\norgan which is now not only useless, but deleterious.” This process\r\nwill continue until the organ becomes rudimentary and finally\r\ndisappears.\r\n\r\nRoux[K] attempted chiefly to explain degeneration in the individual.\r\nDegeneration is looked upon as the result of a struggle among the\r\nparts for (_a_) room and (_b_) food. Without doubting that both these\r\nprinciples are active agents in degeneration, it may be seriously\r\ndoubted whether they are effective in the degeneration of the eyes in\r\nquestion. Certainly there can be no question of a struggle for room,\r\nfor the position and room formerly occupied by the eye is now filled\r\nwith fat, which can not have been operative against the eye. The\r\npresence of this large fat mass in the former location of the eye, the\r\nlarge reserve fat mass in the body, the uniformly good condition of\r\nthe fish and the low vitality, which enables them to live for months\r\nwithout visible food, all argue against the possibility that the\r\nstruggle for food between parts was an active agent in the degeneration\r\nof the eyes.\r\n\r\n    [K] Gesammelte Abhandlungen, 1895.\r\n\r\nKohl[L] considers that “_Der Grund und direkter oder indirekter Anlass\r\nzum Eintreten der Entwickelungshemmung ist Lichtmangel._” The method of\r\noperation of the lack of light he conceived to be as follows:\r\n\r\n    [L] Rudimentäre Wirbelthieraugen, 1893.\r\n\r\nOther organs were developed to compensate for the disuse of the\r\neye; and as the developmental force was used in the formation of\r\nthese organs, each succeeding generation developed its eye less. The\r\ndegeneration is thus explained as the result of a struggle of parts,\r\nalthough this term is nowhere used, acting through the principle of\r\ncompensation. The same objections may be offered to this explanation\r\nof Kohl as to all his theoretical discussions--they are based on the\r\nassumption of conditions and processes that have no existence. The\r\nhigh development of ‘compensating’ organs is not primarily the result\r\nof the loss of the eye, but the high development of the former organs\r\npermitted the disuse and later degeneration of the latter. His whole\r\nprocess is a phylogenetic one, without a preceding ontogenetic one,\r\nthough on this point he does not seem to be very clear himself, for on\r\none page we are told that degeneration leads to retardation, and on\r\nanother that degeneration is a consequence of retardation.\r\n\r\nLedenfeld[M] endeavors to apply Roux’s _Kampf der Theile_, with\r\nreversed selection, to explain the conclusions reached by Kohl on the\r\nprocesses and causes of degeneration. The struggle is represented as\r\ntaking place between the germ and soma, the former endeavoring to keep\r\nthe latter at the lowest efficient point as weapon for the germ. If a\r\nseries of individuals get into the dark the organs of vision are of no\r\nadvantage and reversed selection will bring about their degeneration.\r\nThe saving in ontogeny appears first as a retardation and then as a\r\ncessation of development.\r\n\r\n    [M] Zoölogischer Centralblatt, 1896.\r\n\r\nWeismann[N] more recently accepts the view of Romanes, Morgan and\r\nLankester on the inadequacy of panmixia to explain the whole phenomena\r\nof degeneration, and in his ‘Germinal Selection’ rejects the idea\r\nof reversed selection, and suggests a new explanation for what\r\nRomanes attributed to the failure of heredity and the Lamarckians to\r\ntransmission of the effects of disuse. The struggle of the parts of\r\nRoux has been crowded by him back to the representatives of these parts\r\nin the germ.\r\n\r\n    [N] The Monist, 1896, pp. 250-274.\r\n\r\n“The phenomena observed in the stunting, or degeneration, of parts\r\nrendered useless ... show distinctly that ordinary selection, which\r\noperates by the removal of entire persons--personal selection, as I\r\nprefer to call it--can not be the only cause of degeneration, for\r\nin most cases of degeneration it can not be assumed that slight\r\nindividual vacillations in the size of the organ in question have\r\npossessed selective value. On the contrary, we see such retrogressions\r\neffected apparently in the shape of a continuous evolutionary process\r\ndetermined by internal causes, in the case of which there can be no\r\nquestion whatever of selection of persons or of a survival of the\r\nfittest--that is, of individuals with the smallest rudiments. The\r\ngradual diminution continuing for thousands and thousands of years\r\nand culminating in its final and absolute effacement” can only be\r\naccomplished by germinal selection. Germinal selection as applied to\r\ndegeneration is the formal explanation of Romanes’ failure of heredity\r\nthrough the struggle of parts for food. “Powerful determinants will\r\nabsorb nutriment more rapidly than weaker determinants. The latter,\r\naccordingly, will grow more slowly and will produce weaker determinants\r\nthan the former.” If an organ is rendered useless, the size of this\r\norgan is no longer an element in personal selection. This alone would\r\nresult in a slight degeneration. Minus variations are, however,\r\nsupposed to rest “on the weaker determinants of the germ, such as\r\nabsorb nutriment less powerfully than the rest. This will enable the\r\nstronger determinants to deprive them even of the full quantum of food\r\ncorresponding to their weakened capacity of assimilation, and their\r\ndescendants will be weakened still more. Inasmuch, now, as no weeding\r\nout of the weaker determinants of the hind leg [or eye] by personal\r\nselection takes place on our hypothesis, inevitably the average\r\nstrength of this determinant must slowly but constantly diminish--that\r\nis, the hind leg [or eye] must grow smaller and smaller until it\r\nfinally disappears altogether.... Panmixia is the indispensable\r\nprecondition of the whole process; for, owing to the fact that persons\r\nwith weak determinants are just as capable of life as those with\r\nstrong, ... solely by this means is a further weakening effected in the\r\nfollowing generations.”\r\n\r\nThis theory presupposes the complex structure of the germ plasm\r\nformulated by Weismann and rejected by various persons for various\r\nreasons. But granting Weismann the necessary structure of the germ\r\nplasm, can germinal selection accomplish what is claimed for it? I\r\nthink not. Granting that variations occur about a mean, would not all\r\nthe effects claimed for minus variations be counteracted by positive\r\nvariations? Eye determinants, which, on account of their strength,\r\nsecure more than their fair share of food, and thereby produce eyes\r\nthat are as far above the mean as the others are below, and leave\r\ndescendent determinants that are still stronger than their ancestry\r\nwould balance the effect produced by weak-eye determinants. It is\r\nevident that a large, really extravagant development of the eye\r\nin such a fish as Chologaster would not effect the removal of the\r\nindividual by personal selection; still less so in Amblyopsis, which\r\nnot only lives in comparative abundance, but has lived for twenty\r\nmonths in confinement without visible food, and in which the eye is\r\nminute. It seems that all the admitted objections to degeneration by\r\npanmixia apply with equal force to germinal selection. This, however,\r\nwould be changed were the effect of disuse admitted to affect the\r\ndeterminants, and this it seems Weismann has unconsciously admitted.\r\nSo far we have considered germinal selection in the abstract only. All\r\nits suppositions are found to be but a house of cards when the actual\r\nconditions of degeneration are considered. We find that degeneration\r\nis not a horizontal process affecting all the parts of an organ\r\nalike, as Weismann presupposes, not even a process in the reverse\r\norder of phyletic development, but the more vital, most worked parts\r\ndegenerate first with disuse and panmixia; the passive structures\r\nremain longest. The rate of degeneration is proportional to the past\r\nactivity of the parts, and the statement that “passively functioning\r\nparts--that is, parts which are not alterable during the individual\r\nlife by function--by the same laws also degenerate when they become\r\nuseless” finds no basis in fact, and is an example of the inexact\r\nutterances abundant in the discussion of degeneration on which it is\r\nentirely unsafe to build lofty theoretical structures. As one example\r\nof the unequal degeneration we need only call attention to the scleral\r\ncartilages and the rest of the eye of Troglichthys rosæ.\r\n\r\nAll are agreed that natural selection alone is insufficient to explain\r\nall, if any, of the processes of degeneration. All either consciously\r\nor not admit the principle of panmixia, and all are now agreed that\r\nthis process alone can not produce extensive degeneration. All are\r\nagreed that the important point is degeneration beyond the point\r\nreached by panmixia, the establishment of the degenerating process,\r\nwhatever it may be, in the germ, or, in other words, the breaking of\r\nthe power of heredity. It is in the explanation of the latter that\r\nimportant differences of opinion exist.\r\n\r\nWeismann attempts to explain the degeneration beyond the point which\r\npanmixia can reach by a process which not only is insufficient, even\r\nif all his premises are granted, to produce the desired result without\r\nthe help of use transmission, but has as its result a horizontal\r\ndegeneration which has no existence in fact.\r\n\r\nRomanes supposed degeneration, beyond the point which may be reached\r\nby panmixia, to be the result of personal selection and the failure of\r\nthe hereditary force. The former is not applicable to the species in\r\nquestion, and is denied by such an ardent Darwinist as Weismann to be\r\napplicable at all in accounting for degeneration. Moreover, the process\r\nas explained by Romanes would result in a horizontal degeneration\r\nwhich has no existence in fact. The second assumption, the failure of\r\nhereditary force, is not distinguishable, as Morgan has pointed out,\r\nfrom the effect of use transmission.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 1-6.--Photographs of the upper halves of the heads\r\nof specimens of nearly the same length under the same magnification, to\r\nshow the gradual decrease of the eye.

It is not\r\naffected by the struggle for food, for stored food occupies the former\r\neye space. It could only be affected by the more active selection\r\nof specific parts of food by some actively functioning organ. It\r\nis possible that this has in fact affected the degeneration of the\r\neye. The theory explains degeneration in the individual, and implies\r\nthat the effect in the individual should be transmitted to the next\r\ngeneration. This second part seems but the explanation of the workings\r\nof the Lamarckian factor.\r\n\r\nThe Lamarckian view--that through disuse the organ is diminished\r\nduring the life of the individual, in part, at least, on account of\r\nthe diminution of the amount of blood going to a resting organ, and\r\nthat this effect is transmitted to succeeding generations--not only\r\nwould theoretically account for unlimited progressive degeneration,\r\nbut is the only view so far examined that does not on the face of it\r\npresent serious objections. Is this theory applicable in detail to the\r\nconditions found in the Amblyopsidæ? Before going further, objections\r\nmay again be raised against the universal assumption that the cessation\r\nof use and the consequent panmixia was a sudden process. This assumes\r\nthat the caves were peopled by a catastrophe. But it is absolutely\r\ncertain that the caves were not so peopled, that the cessation of use\r\nwas gradual, and the cessation of selection must also have been a\r\ngradual process. There must have been ever-widening bounds within which\r\nthe variation of the eye would not subject the possessor to elimination.\r\n\r\nChologaster is in a stage of panmixia as far as the eye is concerned.\r\nIt is true the eye is still functional, but that the fish can do\r\nwithout its use is evident by its general habit and by the fact that\r\nit sometimes lives in caves. The present conditions have apparently\r\nexisted for countless generations--as long as the present habits have\r\nexisted--and yet the eye still maintains a higher degree of structure\r\nthan reverse selection, if operative, would lead us to expect, and\r\na lower than the birth mean of fishes depending on their eyes, the\r\ncondition that the state of panmixia alone would lead us to expect.\r\nThere is a staying quality about the eye with the degeneration, and\r\nthis can only be explained by the degree of use to which the eye is\r\nsubjected.\r\n\r\nThe results in Chologaster are due to panmixia and the limited degree\r\nof use to which the eye is put. Chologaster Agassizii shows the rapid\r\ndiminution with total disuse.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the conditions between Chologaster and Amblyopsis,\r\nTyphlichthys and Troglichthys, is that in the former the eyes are still\r\nin use, except when living in caves; in the latter they have not been\r\nin a position to be used for hundreds of generations. The transition\r\nbetween conditions of possible use and absolute disuse may have been\r\nrapid with each individual after permanently entering a cave. Panmixia,\r\nas regards the minute eye, continued. Reversed selection, for economy,\r\ncan not have affected the eye for reasons already stated. The mere\r\nloss of the force of heredity, unless this was caused by disuse, or\r\nthe process of germinal selection, can not have brought about the\r\nconditions, because some parts have been affected more than others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Head of a very young _Amblyopsis_ before all\r\nthe yolk is absorbed.]\r\n\r\nConsidering the parts most affected and the parts least affected, the\r\ndegree of use is the only cause capable of explaining the conditions.\r\nThose parts most active during use are the ones reduced most--viz.,\r\nthe muscles, the retina, optic nerve and dioptric appliances, the lens\r\nand vitreous parts. Those organs occupying a more passive position,\r\ne. g., the scleral cartilages, have been much less affected. The lens\r\nis one of the latest organs affected, not at all during use, possibly\r\nbecause during use it would continuously be in use. It disappears most\r\nrapidly after the beginning of absolute disuse both ontogenetically\r\nand phylogenetically. All indications point to use and disuse as the\r\neffective agents in molding the eye. The process, however, does not\r\ngive results with mathematical precision. In Typhlichthys subterraneus\r\nthe pigmented layer is affected differently from that of Amblyopsis.\r\nThe variable development of the eye muscles in different species would\r\noffer another objection if we did not know of the variable condition\r\nof these structures in different individuals. Chilton has objected\r\nto the application of the Lamarckian factor to explain degeneration,\r\non account of the variable effects of degeneration in various\r\ninvertebrates. But such differences in the reaction are still less\r\nexplainable by any of the other theories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION AND PRESENT STATUS OF THE AUTOMOBILE.\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM BAXTER, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this closing year of a century which is marked by unparalleled\r\nadvances in science and its applications to the industrial arts,\r\nwe are very much inclined to take it for granted that none of the\r\ninventions that are regarded by us as indicative of the highest order\r\nof progressive tendency, could by any possibility have been thought\r\nof by our forefathers; and as the automobile is looked upon as an\r\nultra-progressive idea, no one who has not investigated the subject\r\nwould believe for a moment that its conception could antedate the\r\npresent generation, much less the present century. The records,\r\nhowever, show that the subject engrossed the attention of inventive\r\nminds many hundreds of years ago. In fact, as far back as the beginning\r\nof the thirteenth century a Franciscan monk named Roger Bacon\r\nprophesied that, the day would come when boats and carriages would be\r\npropelled by machinery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. CUGNOT’S STEAM GUN CARRIAGE, MADE IN 1763.]\r\n\r\nThe first authentic record of a self-propelled carriage dates back to\r\nthe middle of the sixteenth century. The inventor was Johann Haustach,\r\nof Nuremburg. The device is described as a chariot propelled by the\r\nforce of springs, and it is said that it attained a speed of two\r\nthousand paces per hour, about one mile and a quarter. Springs have\r\nbeen tried by many inventors since that time, but always without\r\nsuccess from the simple fact that the amount of energy that can be\r\nstored in a spring is practically insignificant.\r\n\r\nIn 1763 a Frenchman by the name of Cugnot devised a vehicle that\r\nwas propelled by steam, and a few years after the date of his first\r\nexperiment, constructed for the French Government a gun carriage which\r\nis shown in Fig. 1. As will be seen, the design was of the tricycle\r\ntype, and it was intended to mount the gun between the rear wheels. The\r\nboiler, which resembles a huge kettle, hung over the front end and was\r\napparently devoid of a smoke stack. Motion was imparted to the front\r\nwheel by means of a ratchet. Although this invention is very crude, it\r\nmust be regarded as meritorious if we consider that it was made before\r\nthe steam engine had been developed in a successful form for stationary\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. SYMINGTON’S STEAM COACH, MADE IN 1784.]\r\n\r\nThe next effort to solve the problem was made by W. Symington in the\r\nyear 1784, the carriage devised by him being illustrated in Fig. 2.\r\nThis coach, although pretentious in appearance, was crude mechanically,\r\nbut it actually ran. The service, however, was not what could be called\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. TREVITHICK’S STEAM CARRIAGE, MADE IN 1803.]\r\n\r\nIn 1803, Richard Trevithick brought out the carriage shown in Fig.\r\n3, which could run, but was artistically a failure. Moreover, the\r\nmachinery was such as would soon give out, even if well designed, on\r\naccount of its exposed position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. STEAM COACH, MADE BY JAMES AND ANDERSON, ABOUT\r\n1810.]\r\n\r\nBetween 1805 and 1830, quite a number of steam vehicles were invented\r\nand put into practical operation. Fig. 4 shows a very elaborate coach\r\nof this period, which was invented by W. H. James, and constructed with\r\nthe assistance of Sir James Anderson, Bart. The machinery used in this\r\ndesign consisted of two powerful steam engines, one being connected\r\nwith each one of the hind wheels in a manner similar to that employed\r\nin locomotives at the present time. The wheels were not fast upon the\r\naxle, hence they could revolve at different velocities in rounding\r\ncurves. In this respect this invention embodied one of the features\r\ncommonly used by automobiles of the latest design. Two boilers were\r\nprovided, one for each engine, and the record says that with one boiler\r\nthe speed was six to seven miles per hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. STEAM OMNIBUS, MADE BY HANCOCK.]\r\n\r\nFig. 5 shows an omnibus invented by Hancock. This vehicle ran on a\r\nregular route, carrying passengers from Pentonville to Finsbury\r\nSquare, London. Fig. 6 shows a carriage invented by Burstall and Hiel,\r\nwhich attracted a great deal of attention. It was probably the most\r\ncomplete and perfect mechanically of any invention that had been made\r\nup to that time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. BURSTALL AND HIEL’S STEAM CARRIAGE, MADE PRIOR\r\nTO 1825.]\r\n\r\nFig. 7 shows a carriage invented by Squire and Maceroni, who had\r\nbeen for a long time in the service of Goldsworth Gurney, one of the\r\nmost noted experimenters of his day in steam propulsion. A number of\r\ncarriages were made by these workers, on designs similar to Fig. 7, and\r\nit is said that they ran at a high rate of speed, probably ten miles\r\nper hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. STEAM CARRIAGE, MADE BY SQUIRE AND MACERONI.]\r\n\r\nFig. 8 illustrates an invention that is interesting from the fact that\r\nit was to be operated by compressed air, and perhaps was the first\r\neffort to utilize this form of stored energy for the propulsion of\r\nvehicles. It was not a success, but its failure was due to the fact\r\nthat the inventor labored under the delusion that the laws of nature\r\ncould be circumvented by skillfully contrived mechanical devices so as\r\nto obtain something from nothing. The body of the carriage was used as\r\na reservoir for the compressed air, and within the wheels were placed\r\na number of pumps, the short bars projecting from the peripheries\r\nbeing the ends of the plungers. The expectation was that as the wheels\r\nrevolved, the plungers would be depressed, and thus air would be\r\npumped into the reservoirs and this air would operate the engine that\r\npropelled the vehicle; hence the apparatus would supply its own power,\r\nand realize perpetual motion. If this attempt to controvert the laws\r\nof nature had not been relied upon, better results might have been\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. COMPRESSED AIR WAGON, MADE ABOUT 1810.]\r\n\r\nThe highly ornamental coach shown in Fig. 9 was invented by Dr.\r\nChurch about 1832. In addition to being ornamental, it was of massive\r\nconstruction and large capacity, being able to accommodate fifty\r\npassengers. Its operation is said to have been very satisfactory, a\r\nhigh rate of speed being attained and all grades on ordinary roads\r\nbeing easily mounted. The inventor swamped himself in endeavoring to\r\ncompete with railroads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. SIDE VIEW OF DR. CHURCH’S STEAM COACH, MADE IN\r\n1832.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most perfect of all the early automobiles was the one\r\ndevised by Scott Russell, the celebrated designer of the Great Eastern.\r\nThis carriage is shown in Fig. 10. It was operated successfully, and\r\nwas able to mount the steepest hills and to attain a high rate of\r\nspeed, but as coal was used for fuel and the engines were of large\r\ncapacity, it is probable that the smoke, exhaust steam and noise of\r\nthe machinery were decidedly objectionable features. A line of these\r\ncoaches was put in commission in Glasgow in 1846, each one having a\r\nseating capacity of twenty-six, six inside and twenty on the top. After\r\nseveral months of successful operation, the line was withdrawn on\r\naccount of the opposition of the authorities and of the general public.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9A. DR. CHURCH’S STEAM COACH ON THE ROAD.]\r\n\r\nThese few examples of the early attempts to solve the problem of\r\nmechanical propulsion of vehicles are sufficient to show that the\r\nautomobile is not entirely a creation of the progressive mind of the\r\nlatter part of the nineteenth century, but that it engrossed the\r\nattention of inventors more than one hundred and thirty years ago. The\r\nsuccess attained by the workers in this field at different periods was\r\ndirectly in proportion to the degree to which the form of power used\r\nhad been perfected at the time. The first inventors attained but slight\r\nsuccess, owing to the fact that, in their time, the steam engine was in\r\na crude form, but as the construction of the latter improved, so did\r\nthat of the vehicles operated by it.\r\n\r\nBefore the days of steam, the power of wind mills was utilized to\r\npropel vehicles, and with such success that in the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries wind-propelled wagons or ‘Charvolants,’ as\r\nthey were called, were very numerous upon the flat plains of the\r\nNetherlands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. SCOTT RUSSELL’S STEAM CARRIAGE, MADE IN 1845.]\r\n\r\nFrom 1845 up to the early nineties, a period of nearly half a century,\r\nvery little was done in the way of developing the automobile. From time\r\nto time inventors in various parts of the world devoted themselves to\r\nthe subject, but they were generally looked upon as visionary cranks,\r\nand their work attracted little attention. During this period there\r\nwas an almost universal prejudice against the use of any kind of\r\nmechanical power upon the streets or public highways, and it is even\r\npossible that if during these years any one had invented a horseless\r\ncarriage, perfect in every way, he would have failed to obtain proper\r\nrecognition. Prejudice against mechanically-propelled vehicles has\r\ngradually worn away, probably because of the introduction of cable\r\nand trolley cars, and at the present time the majority of people\r\ndesire to see the substitution of mechanical for animal power. As a\r\nresult of this change in public opinion, self-propelled vehicles are\r\naccepted as entirely satisfactory, which a few years ago would have\r\nbeen regarded as failures. Notwithstanding this tolerant feeling,\r\nhowever, it is very doubtful whether the cumbersome coaches of the\r\nearly part of the century would be received with favor at the present\r\ntime when taste and requirements are entirely different. What is now\r\ndesired is a light, fast-running and attractive vehicle, which could\r\nnot be constructed along the lines followed by the inventors of former\r\ndays. The automobile of to-day is a far more perfect device than its\r\npredecessors, although it can not be said to have reached a state of\r\nperfection. As motive power, steam, gasoline and electricity are used.\r\nWhich of the three is the best, taking all things into consideration,\r\nit would be difficult to say, as each one has its defects as well as\r\nits advantages, and the evident superiority of each one in a certain\r\ndirection is offset by deficiencies in other directions.\r\n\r\nIn every civilized country, where the mechanic arts are far enough\r\nadvanced, automobiles are now being manufactured, but France is the\r\ncountry where modern development first began, and up to the present\r\ntime it has maintained its leading position, although in quality of\r\nproduct, other nations, if not on a par with it, are certainly not very\r\nfar behind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. SERPOLLET CARRIAGE, A MODERN STEAM AUTOMOBILE\r\nOF FRENCH DESIGN.]\r\n\r\nThe perfection to which the steam automobile has been developed in\r\nthese latter days is due mainly to the efforts of L. Serpollet, a\r\ndistinguished French engineer. Other highly successful steam carriages\r\nare now manufactured in England and in this country, as well as in\r\nseveral European nations, but Serpollet was the first to bring forth\r\na successful fast-running and attractive vehicle, and the others have\r\nprofited by his work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. SIDE VIEW OF SERPOLLET CARRIAGE, SHOWING\r\nLOCATION OF ENGINE, BOILER, CONDENSER, ETC.]\r\n\r\nOne of the many designs of Serpollet carriages is shown in Fig. 11;\r\nFig. 12 shows more fully the arrangement and location of the machinery.\r\nThe engine used in these vehicles is made with four cylinders of the\r\nsingle action type; that is, they take steam at one end only. By using\r\nthis construction, while the number of cylinders is increased, the\r\nother parts are greatly simplified, as the piston rods, crossheads and\r\nguides can be dispensed with. In addition, the whole engine can be made\r\nvery compact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. SHOWING DETAILS OF THE BOILER OF THE SERPOLLET\r\nCARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe boiler is of the flash type; that is, it carries no water\r\nordinarily, but when the engine is in operation, a pump injects into\r\nthe boiler at each stroke of the engine as much water as may be\r\nrequired to generate the steam necessary to propel the vehicle; the\r\ninstant the water enters the boiler it is converted into steam. As\r\nthe amount of steam is proportional to the amount of water, it can\r\nbe seen that by regulating the water supply, the power of the engine\r\nand thereby the speed of the carriage, can be controlled. This is the\r\nmethod actually employed to control the speed. In starting, a handle\r\nis moved which connects the engine, the boiler and the pump in the\r\nproper relation; and while under way the velocity is varied by the\r\nmanipulation of a lever which controls the amount of water injected\r\ninto the boiler. The fuel used is kerosene, which is vaporized and then\r\nfed into a properly constructed burner. The amount of oil supplied to\r\nthe burner is regulated by the same lever that regulates the supply of\r\nwater, so that both are increased or reduced in the proper proportion.\r\nThe boiler is constructed of a number of steel tubes, which are about\r\ntwo and a half inches in diameter, and from three eighths to half an\r\ninch thick. These tubes are pressed into the form shown in Fig. 13, the\r\ndark line in the section marked A representing the interior space. A\r\nnumber of tubes collapsed in this form and bent into the shape B, are\r\nassembled as shown at C. The number of tubes depends upon the capacity\r\nof the boiler. As the tubes are very thick, they can, without any\r\ndanger of bursting, be heated to so high a temperature that the water\r\ninjected into them is at once turned into steam.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 12 it will be seen that the engine is located under the body\r\nof the carriage between the two axles, and that motion is imparted to\r\nthe hind wheels by means of chains and sprocket wheels. The boiler is\r\nlocated at the back of the vehicle, the lower part projecting some\r\ndistance below the rear axle. A small smoke stack at the rear of the\r\nbody allows the gases of combustion to escape. Between the front\r\nwheels, a compact condenser is located, and into this the steam from\r\nthe engine is exhausted. The condenser serves two purposes; it recovers\r\na portion of the water that would otherwise escape into the air, and\r\nthus increases the distance the carriage can run without a new supply,\r\nand at the same time it lessens the noise produced by the exhaust, and\r\nalso the volume of steam escaping into the atmosphere, which in cold or\r\nrainy weather becomes plainly visible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. AN AMERICAN STEAM CARRIAGE OF 1900.]\r\n\r\nAlthough we have been rather slow in this country in taking up the\r\nautomobile, inventors and manufacturers are now working at a pace that\r\nwill soon make up for lost time. We already have a number of designs\r\nof steam carriages whose operation is highly creditable. Fig. 14\r\nillustrates one of these. The design of the engine, boiler and other\r\nmechanism can be well understood from Fig. 15, in which a portion of\r\nthe body is removed to expose the internal parts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. SECTIONAL VIEW OF FIG. 14, SHOWING LOCATION OF\r\nENGINE, BOILER AND OTHER DETAILS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15A. PLAN OF STEAM CARRIAGE SHOWN IN FIGS. 14 AND\r\n15.]\r\n\r\nThe boiler is a very compact form of the upright type, such as is used\r\nin fire engines. It is about fourteen inches in diameter and twenty\r\ninches high. To increase its strength, it is surrounded with two layers\r\nof piano wire. The engine is of the locomotive type, consisting of two\r\ncylinders, the pistons of which are connected with cranks on the end\r\nof the shaft, these cranks being set at right angles, so as to prevent\r\ncatching the engine on the dead center. The direction of rotation\r\nis reversed by means of the ordinary link motion. The fuel used is\r\ngasoline, which is carried in the cylindrical tank located under the\r\nfront of the carriage. The gasoline is vaporized and then, mixed with a\r\nproper proportion of air, passes to a burner placed under the boiler.\r\nThe amount of steam generated is regulated by the amount of gasoline\r\nsupplied to the burner, and this supply in turn is regulated by the\r\npressure of the steam, so that the action is entirely automatic. The\r\ncylinder H is a reservoir of compressed air, connected with tank I, so\r\nthat the gasoline is under pressure, and therefore is forced through\r\nthe pipe to the burner under the boiler. Between the burner and the\r\ntank there is a valve controlled by the steam pressure, being opened\r\nwhen the pressure is low and closed when it is high. When the pressure\r\nreaches a certain point the valve is closed entirely, so that even if\r\nthe carriage is running very slowly, it is not possible to run the\r\npressure above the fixed limit. The exhaust passes from the engine\r\ncylinders into a muffler, from which it escapes into the pipe K. This\r\npipe projects downward into an opening through the center of the water\r\ntank, and the draught produced thereby draws the gases of combustion\r\nthrough from the top of the boiler to the under side of the carriage\r\nbody, where they escape into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. ENGINE OF CARRIAGE SHOWN IN FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\nDirectly in front of the exhaust muffler is seen the water gauge,\r\nwhich is in such a position as to be outside of the carriage body,\r\nas shown in Fig. 14. A mirror is placed at the front of the vehicle,\r\nand by looking into this the water gauge can be seen. Fig. 14 also\r\nshows clearly the position of the operating levers at the side of the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nThe actual construction of the engine is better shown in Fig. 16, in\r\nwhich A A are the cylinders, B is the steam chest and G G are the valve\r\nrods. The piston rods connect with the crossheads C. The connecting\r\nrods D transmit motion from the latter to the cranks E, and thus\r\nrotate the shaft S. The link motions, by means of which the direction\r\nof rotation is reversed, are at I I, and are operated by the lever G,\r\nwhich is mounted upon the shaft F F. This shaft is directly connected\r\nwith the starting lever. The boiler feed pump is located at M. The\r\nmotion of the engine is transmitted to the rear axle of the carriage by\r\nmeans of a chain that runs over the sprocket wheel L located between\r\nthe eccentrics K K. In Fig. 15, this wheel is located at D, and the\r\nchain F connects it with the axle sprocket E.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. AMERICAN STEAM AUTOMOBILE OF 1900.]\r\n\r\nFig. 17 shows another American steam carriage. In this vehicle the\r\nrunning gear is a complete truck, upon which the carriage body is\r\nsupported. The appearance of the truck with the body removed is shown\r\nin Fig. 18. The boiler is of the tubular type and the double cylinder\r\nengine is secured to its side. In this particular the construction\r\ndiffers from that of the previously described carriage, for in that the\r\nengine is attached to the cross-framing of the body of the vehicle.\r\nAlthough the general appearance of the mechanism of these two carriages\r\nis very similar, there are many differences in the details of their\r\nconstruction. In both, vertical tubular boilers are used, and the steam\r\nis generated by the use of gasoline, which is burned in the vaporized\r\nstate in specially constructed burners. The engine in both cases is\r\nof the vertical double cylinder type, and motion is transmitted to\r\nthe hind axle by means of sprocket wheels and a chain; but here the\r\nsimilarity ends; the minor details, which it is not necessary to refer\r\nto in this connection, are with few exceptions very different.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\nA careful examination of Figs. 11, 14 and 17 will show that from\r\nan artistic point of view these examples of steam carriages are\r\nsatisfactory. In regard to their operation it can be said that they\r\nhave sufficient power to run up the steepest grades encountered on\r\nordinary roads at a fair rate of speed, while on level ground their\r\nvelocity is more than enough to satisfy the average rider. The danger\r\nof explosion is so remote that it need not be considered. The Serpollet\r\nboiler is practically inexplosive, while those used in the American\r\nvehicles are so constructed that they can withstand a pressure far\r\ngreater than any they can be subjected to in practice. It might be\r\nexpected that the motion of the machinery would produce an unpleasant\r\nvibration, but on account of the lightness of the moving parts and\r\ncareful balancing, this effect is much reduced. The use of gasoline as\r\nfuel, in connection with automatic burners, eliminates the smoke and\r\nashes incident to the use of coal, and in addition reduces the labor of\r\nhandling the vehicle, as no attention need be given to the mechanism\r\nother than to see that the water in the boiler is maintained at the\r\nproper level. In the case of the Serpollet carriages, not even this\r\npoint need be looked after, as the feed of the boiler is perfectly\r\nautomatic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC RESULTS OF THE NORWEGIAN POLAR EXPEDITION, 1893-1896.[O]\r\n\r\nBY GENERAL A. W. GREELY, U. S. ARMY.\r\n\r\n    [O] The Norwegian North Polar Expedition, 1893-1896. Scientific\r\n        Results edited by Fridtjof Nansen. Vol. I. Longmans, Green\r\n        & Co. N. Y., 1900. 1-16, 3 pl. 1-147, 3 pl. 1-26, 2 pl.\r\n        1-53 pl. 1-137, 36 pl.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew Arctic expeditions have done so much to increase the world’s\r\nknowledge as to the physical condition of large areas of the north\r\npolar zone as has that of the _Fram_, initiated and commanded by Dr.\r\nFridtjof Nansen.\r\n\r\nThe expedition was unique in many respects. The _Fram_ was a departure\r\nfrom the accepted models of Arctic ships; the route followed was one\r\nunindorsed by any Arctic authority. The ship was destined to drift\r\nunprecedented distances, beset by the enormous ice-pack of the Arctic\r\nocean. The commander himself was not only to attain the highest\r\nnorth, but was to make a most hazardous journey, which was to have\r\na successful and unexpected issue partly through the aid of another\r\npolar expedition whose location and existence were unknown to the\r\nexpeditionary forces of the _Fram_. Electricity made the Arctic ship a\r\nglow of light, a phonograph brought well-known voices to cheer their\r\nhours of leisure. Indeed, every device that was deemed of value was\r\nutilized.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the Arctic ocean traversed by the _Fram_ is indicated by\r\nthe simple fact that she passed over 120 degrees of longitude above the\r\neightieth parallel of north latitude, a distance of one-third around\r\nthe world on that parallel.\r\n\r\nNansen and Johansen, in an attempt to reach the Pole, left the _Fram_\r\nMarch 14, 1895, in about 84° N., 100 E., but after an uneventful\r\njourney with dogs, they were obliged to turn back on April 7, 1895, in\r\nlatitude 86° 14′ N. They aimed to reach Spitzbergen and after months\r\nof weary effort and varying fortunes, these two hardy men landed on\r\nthe east coast of the Franz Josef archipelago. Coming winter forbade\r\nfurther progress, so they constructed a hut and subsisted on land and\r\nsea game that was fortunately abundant. In the spring of 1896, turning\r\nsouthward, they attempted to reach by the kyak the east coast of\r\nSpitzbergen, hoping to be picked up by Norwegian whalers who frequent\r\nthose waters. Fortunately for them, they met in April, 1896, Jackson,\r\nthe commander of the Jackson-Harmsworth expedition, near Cape Flora.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the _Fram_, continuing its westerly drift, in which it\r\npassed the most northerly point reached by Parry in boats in 1827,\r\nemerged from the ice-floe of the Arctic ocean in the late summer\r\nof 1896 and reached Norway on August 20, about ten days later than\r\nNansen’s own arrival with the English expedition from Franz Josef Land.\r\nThe _Fram_ returned with its frame uninjured and its expeditionary\r\nforce in health, after having covered in its voyage across the unknown\r\nPolar sea an enormous area, estimated at fifty thousand square miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. FRIDTJOF NANSEN.]\r\n\r\nThe most important discovery was the oceanic depth of the Arctic Sea,\r\nwhere for hundreds of miles this unknown ocean disclosed a depth of\r\nover two miles. Naturally the absence of land limited the phases of the\r\nscientific work of the expeditionary force, which devoted itself to\r\nrecording the phenomena of the air and the sea.\r\n\r\nNansen in his separate journey utilized his brief opportunities in\r\nFranz Josef Land so successfully that his contributions to the geology\r\nof that region are of no small importance.\r\n\r\nThe world has looked forward with a degree of impatience to the\r\npublication of the scientific results of this expedition, and now is\r\nfavored with the first volume, a beautiful quarto of some 479 pages,\r\nwith 46 fine plates. It consists of a series of memoirs on the building\r\nof the ship, on the birds of the air, on the crustacean forms of sea\r\nlife and a geological study of the southern part of the archipelago\r\nof Franz Josef Land. It is a striking tribute to English-speaking\r\nscientists that the work will appear in English text only. Although\r\nprinted in Christiana, such has been the vigilance of the editors that\r\ntypographical errors are comparatively few.\r\n\r\nThe account by Colin Archer of the construction of the _Fram_ is not\r\nwithout interest, in view of the fact that this vessel was built on\r\nnovel lines calculated to cause the ice to meet a sloping surface, so\r\nthat, pressing down under the bilge, it would cause the vessel to rise\r\nand thus insure its immunity from destruction.\r\n\r\nArcher says: “In order to utilize this principle, it was decided to\r\ndepart entirely from the usual deep-bilged form of section and to adopt\r\na shape which would afford the ice no point of attack normal to the\r\nship’s side, but would, as the horizontal pressure increased, force\r\nthe attacking floes to divide under the ship’s bottom, lifting her as\r\ndescribed above.... Plane or concave surfaces were avoided as much as\r\npossible by giving her round and full lines. This, while increasing the\r\npower to resist pressure from outside, also had the advantage of making\r\nit easy for the ice to glide along the bottom in any direction.”\r\n\r\nAs great length is an element of weakness, the _Fram’s_ length was cut\r\ndown as much as possible, with a tendency to make its form circular\r\nor oval. Various expedients were adopted to reduce the dead weight of\r\nthe ship by a judicious arrangement of materials. While economizing\r\nweight, the cargo-carrying capacity of the ship could not be too much\r\nreduced, and the great strength of the ship must be preserved. Inasmuch\r\nas the broadside of the ship, both structurally and from its shape,\r\nis its weakest part, it was necessary to adopt extraordinary measures\r\nto strengthen it. This was done largely by adding stays of yellow\r\npine placed nearly at right angles to the ship’s sides, and securely\r\nfastened with wooden knees. These were supplemented with upright\r\nstanchions tied by iron straps.\r\n\r\nWhile experienced whalers strongly advocated the square rig, Archer\r\ndecided to ignore their advice and rigged the _Fram_ as a fore-and-aft\r\nthree-masted schooner, which style of rig proved, under the\r\ncircumstances, to be most suitable. The slight increase in leakage is\r\nbelieved by Archer to be due in part to the drawing of the oakum out of\r\nthe seams and in part to the expansion and contraction of the timbers.\r\nWhile the _Fram_ was not subjected to such tremendous ice convulsions\r\nas have been many other Arctic ships, yet her experiences were very\r\nsevere and may be considered to prove that the design and system of\r\nconstruction adopted were the most efficient possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FRAM.]\r\n\r\nThe most extensive, if not the most important, of the treatises that\r\nform this volume, relate to regions and investigations with which the\r\nvoyage of the _Fram_ were only incidentally connected. Reference is\r\nhad to the papers on the geological formations of Cape Flora, Franz\r\nJosef Land, by Professors Nansen, Pompeckj and Nathorst. Dr. Nansen\r\nmost cordially acknowledges his great indebtedness to Mr. Jackson and\r\nDr. Reginald Koettlitz, respectively the leader and geologist of the\r\nJackson-Harmsworth expedition to Franz Josef Land, 1894-1896. The\r\nlatter of these gentlemen, in a spirit of broad scientific generosity,\r\naccorded Dr. Nansen full and equal access to his discoveries, covering\r\nthree years’ work on Northbrook Island, among fossils and geological\r\nconditions of special interest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP SHOWING REGIONS TRAVERSED.]\r\n\r\nNansen confines himself to a brief geological sketch of Cape Flora\r\nand its neighborhood; Pompeckj treats fully the Jurassic fauna, while\r\nNathorst briefly discusses the fossil plants.\r\n\r\nNansen says: “Through Jackson’s kindness and Koettlitz’s valuable\r\nassistance, I was enabled to make a collection of fossils and rocks\r\nfrom the Jurassic deposits of this locality.”\r\n\r\n“(Koettlitz) took me to places where, before my arrival, he had already\r\nfound fossils, or had observed anything of importance. Had it not been\r\nfor him I should certainly not have been able to do what little I did\r\nduring the few days at my disposal. I agree with Koettlitz on all\r\nessential points, and have nothing new of importance to add to what he\r\nhas already said.”\r\n\r\nAs Nansen elsewhere remarks, the memoirs of Pompeckj and Nathorst\r\nsupplement the papers of Koettlitz, Newton and Teall, which appeared in\r\nthe Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, 1897, pp. 477-519, and\r\n1898, pp. 620-651.\r\n\r\nPompeckj describes fully the various fossils, illustrates them with\r\nwealth of detail, discusses their stratigraphical relations, and\r\noutlines the paleographical history of Franz Josef Land.\r\n\r\nOf the twenty-six species collected by Nansen no less than seventeen\r\nare new as compared with the Jackson-Harmsworth collection, which\r\ncontains five species lacking to Nansen. There are representatives of\r\nsingle species only of echinoderms, vermes and gastropods, the scarcity\r\nof the last named being generally characteristic of the Jurassic\r\nfauna of the arctic regions, whether in Siberia, Greenland, or Arctic\r\nAmerica. On the other hand, at Cape Flora the cephalopods and the\r\nlamellibranchs predominate very largely. This fact makes most notable\r\nthe absence of the lamellibranch genus _Aucella_, with all other forms\r\nthat are especially characteristic of the higher Jura.\r\n\r\nThe following new species have been determined by Pompeckj:\r\n_Pseudomonotis Jacksoni_, an ornamented shell of a remarkably large\r\nAviculid form. _Macrocephalites Koettlitzi_, a shell with a very narrow\r\numbilicus and almost completely encircling whorls. _Cadoceras Nanseni_,\r\nan ammonite showing a flat disc-like growth, with moderately thick\r\nwhorls of which cross-sections are nearly elliptical. Another ammonite\r\nmay possibly be a variety of _C. Nanseni_, but Pompeckj considers that\r\nit is a separate species owing to its wider umbilicus, less pronounced\r\ninvolution and somewhat asymmetrical lobe-line.\r\n\r\nPompeckj’s outline of the paleontographical history of Franz Josef Land\r\nis worthy of careful consideration by all interested in this department\r\nof science, although many may differ from some of the conclusions\r\nreached by him. Commenting on the stratigraphical studies of Prof. E.\r\nT. Newton, Pompeckj states that his own investigations compel him to\r\ndiffer materially from the inferences drawn and theories advanced by\r\nthat scientist.\r\n\r\nPompeckj says: “The occurrence of these three genera of Ammonites\r\nproves that the marine fauna of Cape Flora contain representatives of\r\nthe Callovian. More recent marine horizons have certainly not been\r\nformed at Cape Flora, as far as I can judge from the collection of\r\nfossils before me.... The Oxfordian and all the more recent Jurassic\r\nhorizons do not occur as marine deposits at Cape Flora.”\r\n\r\nHe finds species pertaining to the Lower Bajocian, Lower, Middle and\r\nUpper Callovian horizons. It is most interesting to note that only\r\none other part of the arctic regions, Prince Patrick Island, Parry\r\nArchipelago, has produced fossils, described by Haughton as Lias, that\r\nare certainly older than the Callovian. It is, however, recognized as\r\npossible that Lundgreen’s fossils from East Greenland may form another\r\nexception.\r\n\r\nPompeckj points out that while the Bajocian fauna of Cape Flora is\r\nwithout analogy in the arctic regions, it nevertheless presents\r\ndistinct affinities to the Central European Jura, and especially\r\nresembles the Russian Callovian.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this Jurassic collection from Cape Flora is of special\r\nimportance in outlining the geographic distribution of that system.\r\nPompeckj adds: “Hence the existence of a Bajocian sea in the north of\r\nthe Eurasian Jura continent is proved beyond all doubt.... As early as\r\nthe Bajocian period, there existed a Shetland Straits, which separated\r\nthe Eurasian continent, existing through the Lias period until the end\r\nof the Bathonian, from the nearctic Jura continent.”\r\n\r\nThe comments relative to the transition of Nova Zembla, Spitzbergen,\r\nFranz Josef Land, and possibly Alaska, from land to sea and sea to\r\nland, are of marked interest, indicating as they do that large areas of\r\npolar regions were exposed in the mesozoic period to repeated and very\r\nconsiderable oscillations of the sea level.\r\n\r\nThe more interesting of the Jurassic fossils, found at Cape Flora,\r\nare shown in the accompanying illustration. _Cadocera Nanseni_ (n.\r\nsp.), 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. _Cadoceras_, sp. ex. aff. _Cad. Nanseni_ (n.\r\nsp.), 4. _Cadoceras Tchefkini_, d’Orb, 7. _Cadoceras_, sp. indet., 8.\r\n_Quenstedoceras vertumnum_, Sintzow, 9. _Cadoceras Frearsi_, d’Orb, 10.\r\n_Macrocephalites_, 11. _Macrocephalites Koettlitzi_, n. sp., 12.\r\n\r\nThe collections of fossil plants, made by Nansen in Franz Josef Land\r\nthrough the courtesy of the Jackson-Harmsworth expedition, are of\r\nscientific value as indicating the fossil Jurassic flora of Franz\r\nJosef Land as compared with that of Spitzbergen. These collections\r\nfill in a not inconsiderable gap in the Arctic regions, and Nathorst’s\r\ninvestigations serve to confirm the opinions and statements made by\r\nProfessor Heer, whose five volumes of Flora Fossilis Arctica constitute\r\na monumental work. As is well known, research has established the\r\nfact that at one time Spitzbergen was covered with a luxuriant\r\nmiocene vegetation--cypresses, birches, sequoiæ, oaks and planes. It\r\nmoreover appears that this growth was coincident with the period when\r\nSpitzbergen, Greenland, Franz Josef Land and Nova Zembla experienced a\r\ncontinental climate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JURASSIC FOSSILS FOUND AT CAPE FLORA.]\r\n\r\nAs fossil collections accumulate, one appreciates more and more\r\nthe masterly manner in which Heer summed up the results of polar\r\nexploration as regards Arctic vegetable paleontology. He was the\r\nfirst to present to the world a clear idea of the vegetation of the\r\nCretaceous land, scarcely known to science until elucidated by him.\r\nIt developed that in Heer’s time, among the fossil plants found in\r\nSpitzbergen alone were 7 ginkos, 8 pines, a short bamboo, 7 poplars, 3\r\nmaples and a fossil strawberry.\r\n\r\nDr. Nansen was fortunate in securing the co-operation of Prof. A. G.\r\nNathorst in the examination of the fossil plants collected in Franz\r\nJosef Land, as he has devoted much time to the flora, present and past,\r\nof various portions of the Arctic regions, especially Spitzbergen\r\nand King Charles Land. Nathorst had the advantage of the notes of\r\nNewton, J. H. Steele and R. Curtis on the fossils of Franz Josef Land,\r\npublished in the Quarterly Journal of Geological Science, London, vols.\r\n53-54, 1897-1898.\r\n\r\nMost unfortunately, the fossils were very fragmentary, the leaves in\r\nthemselves small and often indistinguishable in color from the rock, so\r\nthat their examination was made almost entirely under the magnifying\r\nlens. While the organic substance of the plants was sometimes still\r\nto be seen in a soft, brownish variety of rock, yet the harder\r\nyellowish varieties offered only impressions, or cavities, their\r\norganic substance having entirely disappeared. In cross fractures there\r\nwere sometimes cavities which were complete transverse sections of\r\nconiferous leaves.\r\n\r\nThere were twenty-nine species, of which the entire number are\r\nconiferous except one fungus, one fern, two palms and one uncertain.\r\n\r\nNathorst says: “The plant-bearing strata of Franz Josef Land, which are\r\nyet known to us, all belong, with the exception of those from Cook’s\r\nRock and Cape Stephen, the age of which is still uncertain, to the\r\nupper Jurassic, or the transition beds to the cretaceous, while as yet\r\nno tertiary strata have been discovered.”\r\n\r\nIn geological age, while the Franz Josef flora resembles most the\r\npreviously known Jurassic floras of Siberia and Spitzbergen, yet\r\nNathorst considers the geological age different, and naturally places\r\nit between the two, it being evidently younger than that of Siberia.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that Doctor Koettlitz found in an isolated\r\nbasalt nunatak (rock or hill protruding from a glacier) fossil plants\r\nsimilar to those found by himself and Nansen on the north side of\r\nCape Flora. These nunatak plants, which Koettlitz believed to be _in\r\nsitu_, are identified by Nathorst as Upper Jurassic, and came from an\r\nelevation variously estimated as from six hundred to seven hundred and\r\nfifty feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nNansen agrees with Koettlitz in believing that tree-trunks found by\r\nthem, charred into charcoal or partly silicified, chiefly belonged to\r\nconifers growing on the soil over which basalt flows were discharged\r\nduring the Upper Jurassic or Lower Cretaceous age, and that they have\r\nbeen charred by a flowing mass of lava that overwhelmed them.\r\n\r\nThese fossil plants tell the story of tremendous physical changes which\r\nhave produced very important modifications in climatic conditions\r\nin the Arctic regions. The changes in the types of vegetable life\r\nare apparently as extensive in high as in low latitudes. The lower\r\ncretaceous flora is almost tropical, as is shown by the predominating\r\nforms of this vegetation. Carboniferous formations obtain extensively\r\nin the Arctic regions, as they occur in the Parry Archipelago,\r\nSpitzbergen and in Siberia. During the carboniferous age there was a\r\ngreat extent of land near the North Pole closely resembling that of\r\nthe temperate latitude of the same period, as is shown by the small\r\nnumber of fossil plants that are peculiar to the Arctic regions. In the\r\ntertiary period miocene flora flourished in Spitzbergen, where even\r\nthe lime, the juniper and poplars have been found near latitude 79 N.\r\nThen also throve sequoias, which closely resemble trees growing in the\r\nsouthern part of the United States. The miocene flora gives evidence\r\nof a very great contrast between the climatic conditions at that epoch\r\nbetween Europe and the Arctic regions.\r\n\r\nThe cretaceous flora throws important light on the changes of climate\r\nin the Arctic regions, and, as has been pointed out, the tropical forms\r\npredominate in the vegetation of the Lower Cretaceous flora. Heer’s\r\nprediction that the plants found on the west coast of Spitzbergen would\r\nalso be found on the East Greenland coast has been fully verified.\r\nMiocene plants have been found from Spitzbergen westward through\r\nIceland and Greenland to Banks Land and in the Parry Archipelago, and\r\nit is interesting to note that more than one fourth of the Arctic\r\nplants are common to the miocene of Europe; in Greenland and on\r\nMcKenzie the percentage is nearly one half.\r\n\r\nIn all probability, the paper which is of the highest popular interest\r\nis the account of the birds by Robert Collet and Dr. Nansen. The\r\nfull notes regarding Arctic birds testify fully to the fact that\r\nthe observers had in view the principal points of ornithological\r\nimportance. These comprise not only a mere record of the presence or\r\nabsence of certain species, but also additional observations regarding\r\nthem in their Arctic habitat.\r\n\r\nCertainly the reproach can not be brought against the expedition of the\r\n_Fram_, which has obtained in the case of many Arctic expeditions, that\r\nit has added nothing to ornithological Arctic data.\r\n\r\nThe account of the birds, prepared by Mr. Robert Collet, has been\r\ncompiled from the various journals of the expeditionary force,\r\nsupplemented by verbal comments of Nansen. The memoir contains such\r\nspecific data as enable students to determine not only the general\r\ncharacter of the avifauna as one moves northward in the Siberian ocean,\r\nbut also the arrival and departure of the migrants and the presence of\r\nstragglers. Among the birds of special interest which were observed\r\nare the gray plover, the gray phalarope, the sabine gull and the\r\ncuneate or Ross’s gull.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest authorities on Arctic birds, Prof. Alfred Newton,\r\nof the University of Cambridge, has well said that in consideration of\r\nthe avifauna of any country its peculiarities can be determined only by\r\ndismissing accidental stragglers from the discussion. In elucidating\r\nthe great question of geographical distribution, one must confine\r\nhimself to either the birds that breed therein, or to those species\r\nwhich regularly frequent it for a considerable portion of the year.\r\n\r\nConsidering the enormous area covered by the _Fram_ expedition and\r\nits great diversity of physical conditions of sea and land, it was\r\nimpossible to treat under a single heading the birds observed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PSEUDALIBROTUS NANSENI, G. O. SARS.]\r\n\r\nMr. Collet has, therefore, been wise in dividing his notes into four\r\nsections, covering the Asiatic coast, the Siberian ocean, the sledge\r\njourney to Franz Josef Land, and the Arctic Ocean to the north of Franz\r\nJosef Land and Spitzbergen. But for this division, confusion would\r\nhave resulted from combining birds of regions so widely extended in\r\nlongitude and latitude.\r\n\r\nThe notes show conclusively what might have been anticipated, that the\r\navifauna of the Siberian Sea, and especially that portion of the Arctic\r\nOcean to the north of Franz Josef Land and Spitzbergen, is strictly\r\nlimited.\r\n\r\nIncluding the species observed during the entire voyage, there are only\r\nthirty-three recorded. Only twenty-one species pertain to the Arctic\r\nOcean, whether as regular migrants or stragglers, after excluding the\r\ntwelve species which were observed near the Asiatic coast. The presence\r\non the shores of the Siberian Sea of some of these twelve, however, is\r\nof ornithological interest. There may be specially mentioned the gray\r\ngoose (_Anser segetum_), long-tailed duck (_Harelda glacialis_), silver\r\ngull (_Larus argentatus_), snowy owl (_Nyctea scandiaca_), gray plover\r\n(_Squatarola helvetica_) and the red-necked phalarope (_Phalaropus\r\nhyperboreous_).\r\n\r\nConfining ourselves to birds observed to the north of 81° 30, attention\r\nis called to the abundant avifauna of the western as compared with the\r\neastern hemisphere. In Kennedy Channel, Grinnell Land, there have been\r\nrecorded no less than thirty-two species against twenty-one noted by\r\nthe _Fram_ in this voyage, including those seen in Franz Josef Land.\r\nThis is not surprising, however, when it is considered that the drift\r\nof the _Fram_ was across a deep ocean of large extent, which is covered\r\nperpetually by an unbroken ice-pack, unrelieved by any view of land\r\nuntil the north coast of Spitzbergen was seen.\r\n\r\nOmitting the birds observed in Franz Josef Land, the paucity of species\r\nfrequenting the great western Arctic Ocean is even more apparent. The\r\nstriking dissimilarity of the four regions traversed by the _Fram_\r\nis plainly evident from the bird-life recorded. While there were\r\nobserved nine species in the Siberian Sea, fifteen in the Franz Josef\r\nArchipelago, eighteen in the Arctic Ocean and twenty-three on the\r\nAsiatic coast, yet only five were common to all four regions, viz.:\r\nthe dovekie, the glaucous gull, the ivory gull, the kittiwake and the\r\nsnow-bird.\r\n\r\nThe Siberian Sea presented a most limited avifauna, as in addition to\r\nthe five common species, there were recorded in the first summer in the\r\nice only the little auk, the fulmar, the roseate gull and a small skua.\r\nThe entire absence of land or shore birds that frequent Arctic islands,\r\nomitting a single straggling snow-bird, indicates clearly that the\r\nSiberian Sea extends far northward unbroken by any land area.\r\n\r\nThe eighteen species of birds that were found in the Arctic Ocean,\r\nfar to the north, naturally demand special comment. The six following\r\nspecies are doubtless stragglers: the ringed plover (_Aegialitis\r\nhiaticula_), 82° 59′ N., the most northerly shore-bird of Spitzbergen,\r\nNordenskiold having observed it on Seven islands, 80° 45′ N.; the\r\neider duck (_Somateria mollissima_), 82° 55′ N., near Spitzbergen; the\r\narctic tern (_Sterna macrura_), 84° 32′ N.; the puffin (_Fratercula\r\narctica glacialis_), 83° 11′ N., near Spitzbergen; the black-backed\r\ngull (_Larus marinus_), 84° 35′ N. 75° E., and the Sabine gull (_Xema\r\nSabini_), 83° N., near Spitzbergen.\r\n\r\nOf other species, the roseate gull (_Rhodostethia rosea_), 84° 41′\r\nN., disappeared as the _Fram_ drifted west from the longitude of\r\nFranz Josef Land, to be replaced as Spitzbergen was neared by a\r\nwader (_Crymophilus fulicarius_), 83° 01′ N.; forked-tailed skuas\r\n(_Stercorarius pomatorhinus_), 82° 57′ N., and Bruennich’s guillemot\r\n(_Uria lomvia_), 83° 11′ N. The glaucous gull (_Larus glaucus_), 84°\r\n48′ N., and long-tailed skua (_Stercorarius longicaudus_), 84° 47′ N.,\r\nalthough seen both summers, were quite infrequent. These data indicate\r\nabsence of land at any near distance to the north, and disclose the\r\ninteresting fact that only the six following species, including the\r\nsnow-bird who is more probably a straggler, can be classed as regular\r\nsummer migrants to the vast ice-fields which cover the Arctic Ocean to\r\nthe north of Spitzbergen and Franz Josef Land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RHODOSTETHIA ROSEA (MAGG), 1824. YOUNG IN FIRST PLUMAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe little auk (_Alle alle_), 84° 48′ N., was visible almost daily near\r\nthe 83d parallel in great numbers during the summer season, wherever\r\nthere were numerous water channels near the _Fram_. Of 40 birds killed\r\nat one time, only ten were females.\r\n\r\nThe dovekie (_Cepphus mandti_), 84° 32′ N., with the little auk, was\r\nthe most numerous of all birds in very high latitudes, and nearly 150\r\nwere shot for the table. Out of 40 specimens only 14 were males. The\r\ndovekie came early, May 13, 1896.\r\n\r\nThe ivory gull (_Pagophila eburnea_) is also present the entire\r\nsummer. It was the first visitor in 1895, when on May 14 it was seen\r\nin 84° 38′ N., and what is of special interest, was flying from the\r\nnorth-northeast.\r\n\r\nThe snow bunting (_Plectrophenax nivalis_), although a land-bird, was\r\nseen both summers at somewhat infrequent intervals, as far as 84°\r\n45′ N. They fed on refuse near the ships, but were also seen near\r\nwater-holes, and appeared to be feeding on crustaceans. Two of three\r\nspecimens were males. The first specimen in 1895 visited the _Fram_\r\non May 22 in 84° 40′ N., and then flew towards the north. In 1896 it\r\nappeared on April 25, the first bird of the year, in 84° 17′ N.\r\n\r\nThe kittiwake (_Rissa tridactyla_) was much less numerous than\r\nthe ivory gull. It was seen in 82° 54′ N. They fed, as a rule, on\r\ncrustaceans, although in one bird were found parts of a _Gadus saida_\r\nabout 70 mm. in length. A _Gadus_ about 120 mm. in length was observed\r\non July 16, 1895, in 84° 42′ N., the most northerly point at which any\r\nfish has been found.\r\n\r\nThe fulmar (_Fulmarus glacialis_) came early in 1895, on May 13, and in\r\n1896 on May 22. This bold, voracious bird fed on crustaceans usually,\r\nand owing to its villainous smell was utilized principally as food for\r\ndogs. The last bird of 1895, a fulmar, was seen on September 14, when\r\nthe _Fram_ was in 85° 05′ N., 79° E. This is the most northern latitude\r\nin which any bird has ever been observed.\r\n\r\nThe fulmars and ivory gulls were very bold and noisy, the latter being\r\nspecially objectionable. Ivory gulls were seen at the winter hut in\r\nFranz Josef Land until October, when all water had long been frozen\r\nover, and appeared again as early as March 12, 1896.\r\n\r\nThe first roseate gulls were young birds observed August 3, 1894, in\r\n81° 05′ N., 120° E., about 500 kilometres from the nearest land. A\r\nlong and interesting description is given of these gulls in various\r\nstages. One of the beautiful plates, which is imperfectly reproduced,\r\nshows the plumage of a very young gull about a month old. Their food\r\nconsists exclusively of small fish and crustaceans, of the latter the\r\n_Hymenodora glacialis_ predominating. Large numbers of these beautiful\r\ngulls were seen in 1895 to the northeast of Franz Josef Land, which\r\npoints to their breeding in that locality. One was seen by Nansen on\r\nJuly 11, 1895, in 82° 08′ N., flying from the northeast.\r\n\r\nThe very full memoir on _Crustacea_ is by Dr. G. O. Sars, well known as\r\none of the editorial committee of the scientific work of the Norwegian\r\nNorth Atlantic Expedition. As the greater number of marine vertebrate\r\nanimals collected by the Norwegian North Polar Expedition belong to\r\nthe _Crustacea_, this memoir covers the greater part of the marine\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nThe _Copepoda_ are predominant, especially those belonging to the\r\n_Calanoid_ group, having been taken at nearly every haul along the\r\nwhole route of the _Fram_. The zoölogical equipment of the _Fram_ was\r\nbased unfortunately on the supposition that the Siberian basin was\r\nshallow, so that the enormous oceanic depths which were found were only\r\ninadequately explored by an extemporized sounding apparatus.\r\n\r\nWhile the results of the dredging operations indicate that there was\r\nvery little animal life at the bottom of the ocean, on the other hand,\r\nit appears that the entire surface of the sea, which consisted usually\r\nof small temporary openings in the ice-pack, was covered with abundant\r\nlife throughout the entire year even to the most northern latitudes.\r\n\r\nIncluding surface and deep-sea specimens, there were taken on October\r\n12, 1895, no less than eleven species in latitude 85° 13′ N., longitude\r\n79° E. On June 28, 1895, in 84° 32′ N., 76° E., there were taken from\r\nthe surface by tow net in a large water-channel fourteen species. This\r\nindicates abundant marine life in the sea immediately near the North\r\nPole.\r\n\r\nThe pelagic animals, therefore, were not found at the sea surface\r\nalone, but were also drawn from considerable depths. Many specimens\r\nwere obtained from strata at least 250 metres below the surface, and in\r\na number of instances from depths ranging between 500 and 1,000 metres.\r\nIt is to be added that the imperfect development of the visual organs\r\nof the peculiar amphipod, _Cyclocaris Guilelmi_, Chevreux, points to\r\nabyssal habits, as similar conditions do in the cases of other pelagic\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nIn general pelagic fauna in the Polar Sea resembles that of the\r\nnorthern Atlantic basin, the greater number of species being common\r\nto both. While several heretofore unknown forms collected by this\r\nexpedition may be peculiar to the polar basin, yet it is not improbable\r\nthat these forms also occur in the North Atlantic. This appears\r\nprobable, since the western part of the _Fram’s_ route lies on the\r\nborder of the two basins, where the fauna does not differ essentially\r\nfrom that in the eastern part.\r\n\r\nWhile the pelagic fauna of the Polar Sea, even in the lowest depths,\r\nresembles that of the Atlantic basin, the great salinity of its water\r\nclearly indicates that it comes from the North Atlantic, and it is\r\ntherefore more than probable that the migration of pelagic animals to\r\nthe North Polar Sea is also from the west.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Doctor Sars is of the opinion that the greater part of the\r\npelagic life of the north-polar basin comes by the underlying easterly\r\ncurrent from the North Atlantic. On the other hand, it is evident that\r\nthe westerly-flowing surface current of the Siberian Sea is of vital\r\nimportance as a means of supplying nourishment to the marine animals\r\nof the western Arctic Ocean. This food supply, microscopic algæ chiefly\r\n_Diatomeae_, while very abundant on the surface of the Siberian Sea,\r\ndiminishes gradually towards the west. “Indeed,” says Sars, “without\r\nsuch a constant conveyance of nourishing matter, there could be no such\r\nrich animal life in the Polar Sea.”\r\n\r\nA very remarkable fact was the presence of certain pelagic _Copepoda_,\r\nwhich hitherto had only been observed in southern waters, and a\r\n_Calanoid_ of the genus _Hemicalanus_ Claus, previously known only\r\nfrom the Mediterranean and tropical parts of the Atlantic and Pacific\r\noceans. Two species of the genus _Oncoea_, which accord perfectly with\r\nspecies in the Bay of Naples, were found in great abundance north of\r\nthe New Siberian Islands. Another copepod, of the genus _Lubbockia_\r\nClaus, heretofore only known in the Mediterranean and tropical oceans,\r\nwas found in the same locality, with which was a small perfectly\r\nhyaline copepod of the very remarkable genus _Mormonilla_, of which\r\nheretofore only two species have been recorded, both in the tropical\r\nPacific and south of the equator.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable forms are those mentioned by Doctor Sars,\r\nwhen he says: “The very close and apparently genetic relationship\r\nbetween the two polar species of the amphipodous genus _Pseudalibrotos_\r\nand those occurring in the Caspian Sea, is another remarkable instance\r\nwhich seems fully to corroborate the correctness of the assumption\r\nof geologists as to a direct connexion in olden times between this\r\nisolated basin and the North Polar Sea.”\r\n\r\nBoth species, taken near 85° N., are regarded as the primitive types\r\nfrom which the Caspian forms are descended. The more remarkable of the\r\nArctic forms, _P. Nanseni_, is reproduced on page 430.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, this volume is a most valuable contribution to the\r\nscientific literature of the Arctic regions. It has but one marked\r\nobjection, its publication in such beautiful form and high price as\r\nnecessarily places this series beyond the means of many scientific\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_LEGISLATION AGAINST MEDICAL DISCOVERY._[P]\r\n\r\n    [P] An open letter from President Eliot of Harvard University\r\n        to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the District of\r\n        Columbia.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: I observe that a new bill on the subject of vivisection has\r\nbeen introduced into the Senate, Bill No. 34. This bill is a slight\r\nimprovement on its predecessor, but it is still very objectionable. I\r\nbeg leave to state very briefly the objection to all such legislation.\r\n\r\n1. To interfere with or retard the progress of medical discovery is an\r\ninhuman thing. Within fifteen years medical research has made rapid\r\nprogress, almost exclusively through the use of the lower animals,\r\nand what such research has done for the diagnosis and treatment of\r\ndiphtheria it can probably do in time for tuberculosis, erysipelis,\r\ncerebro-spinal meningitis and cancer, to name only four horrible\r\nscourges of mankind which are known to be of germ origin.\r\n\r\n2. The human race makes use of animals without the smallest\r\ncompunctions as articles of food and as laborers. It kills them,\r\nconfines them, gelds them and interferes in all manner of ways with\r\ntheir natural lives. The liberty we take with the animal creation in\r\nusing utterly insignificant numbers of them for scientific researches\r\nis infinitesimal compared with the other liberties we take with\r\nanimals, and it is that use of animals from which the human race has\r\nmost to hope.\r\n\r\n3. The few medical investigators can not, probably, be supervised or\r\ninspected or controlled by any of the ordinary processes of Government\r\nsupervision. Neither can they properly be licensed, because there is no\r\ncompetent supervising or licensing body. The Government may properly\r\nlicense a plumber, because it can provide the proper examination\r\nboards for plumbers; it can properly license young men to practice\r\nmedicine, because it can provide the proper examination boards for that\r\nprofession, and these boards can testify to the fitness of candidates;\r\nbut the Government cannot provide any board of officials competent to\r\ntestify to the fitness of the medical investigator.\r\n\r\n4. The advocates of anti-vivisection laws consider themselves more\r\nhumane and merciful than the opponents of such laws. To my thinking\r\nthese unthinking advocates are really cruel to their own race. How\r\nmany cats or guinea pigs would you or I sacrifice to save the life\r\nof our child or to win a chance of saving the life of our child? The\r\ndiphtheria-antitoxin has already saved the lives of many thousands\r\nof human beings, yet it is produced through a moderate amount of\r\ninconvenience and suffering inflicted on horses and through the\r\nsacrifice of a moderate number of guinea pigs. Who are the merciful\r\npeople--the few physicians who superintend the making of the antitoxin\r\nand make sure of its quality, or the people who cry out against the\r\ninfliction of any suffering on animals on behalf of mankind?\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, possible to legislate against an improper use of\r\nvivisection. For instance, it should not be allowed in secondary\r\nschools or before college classes for purposes of demonstration only;\r\nbut any attempt to interfere with the necessary processes of medical\r\ninvestigation is, in my judgment, in the highest degree inexpedient,\r\nand is fundamentally inhuman.\r\n\r\n    Yours very truly,\r\n        C. W. ELIOT.\r\n\r\n  HON. JAMES MCMILLAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE HIGHER EDUCATION FOR COLORED YOUTH._\r\n\r\nProf. Shaler’s article in the June number of the POPULAR SCIENCE\r\nMONTHLY was in many ways sensible and timely, but it seems to the\r\nwriter that in common with many other people he is misleading in his\r\nremarks about higher education for the negro. One would think from\r\nthe great outcry against the higher education for young people of the\r\ncolored race, that scarcely any other kind of education was being given\r\nthem. On all sides we hear the familiar refrain: “The higher education\r\nfor the negro has been a failure.” Now success is a relative term. If\r\na mere handful of colored college graduates, in a few years, ought to\r\nhave settled the race problem, and induced their white fellow-citizens\r\nto treat these graduates and all members of their race fairly, then\r\nit has been a failure. But if the higher education should simply\r\ngive added power of mind, enlarge the mental grasp and capacity for\r\nusefulness, lift up, socially, morally, religiously and financially,\r\nnot only its disciples, but also thousands who have been induced to\r\nlook upward by the force of their example, then the higher education\r\nfor colored youth has been a tremendous success. Is not the latter the\r\nfair test? Of course the higher education of the few has not eliminated\r\ncrime. It has not done that for the white race. The writer is a colored\r\nman and a college graduate. He can not see that the higher education\r\nhas any different effect on the colored youth from what it has on the\r\nwhite. If there be any difference it is this: It raises the colored\r\nyouth from a lower social level, as a rule, and places him on a social\r\nplane, relatively, among his own people, higher than it does in the\r\ncase of the white youth. The higher training, therefore, should be more\r\nvaluable to the colored youth.\r\n\r\nIn a recent address before a graduating class at Howard University,\r\nthe Hon. W. T. Harris, Commissioner of Education, submitted statistics\r\nwhich showed that the proportionate number of secondary and higher\r\nstudents to the whole number of children attending school in the United\r\nStates had increased from 2.22 per cent in 1879 to 5.01 per cent in\r\n1897, nearly two and a half times; while the proportion of colored\r\nstudents in secondary schools and colleges had increased very little\r\nindeed, from 1 per cent to only 1.16 per cent. But the story is not yet\r\nhalf told. According to the report of the Commissioner of Education,\r\n1897-98, Vol. 2, page 2,097, the total number of students taking the\r\nhigher education in the United States, as a whole, was 144,477, being\r\n1,980 to each million of the total population. The same report, page\r\n2,480, gives the total number of colored students pursuing collegiate\r\ncourses in these much discussed colored colleges as 2,492. This is only\r\n310 to the million of colored population, whereas the whole of the\r\nUnited States, as shown above, had 1,980 to the million, nearly six\r\nand a half times as many in proportion to population. This does not\r\nlook as if the entire colored population were rapidly stampeding to the\r\nhigher education, or as if the labor supply in the Southern States were\r\nfalling off from this cause.\r\n\r\nThis is an age of higher education for the masses. The increase\r\nin the number of students taking the secondary and higher\r\neducation in the United States during the last ten years has been\r\nphenomenal--unprecedented. Is the person of color so much superior to\r\nthe white that he does not need so much educational training? I think\r\nnot. In view of the history and present condition of this race, there\r\nis an obvious necessity for a large number of educated and trained\r\nteachers, ministers, physicians, lawyers and pharmacists; and in view\r\nof the fact that this race has only one fifth of its quota pursuing\r\nstudies above the elementary grades, what fair mind will not say that\r\nthere is great need of more of the secondary and higher education for\r\ncolored youth, instead of less of it?\r\n\r\nAccording to the report above cited, 161 academies and colleges for\r\ncolored youth in the United States reported. The total number enrolled\r\nwas 42,328, of which 2,492 were reported in collegiate grades, 13,669\r\nin secondary grades and 26,167 in elementary grades. Even in these\r\ncolored colleges less than 6 per cent of the students are pursuing\r\ncollegiate courses. Of these, perhaps not more than 2 per cent are\r\npursuing a college course equal to that offered at Howard. Nearly\r\ntwo thirds of the total enrollment in these colored colleges are\r\nreceiving elementary instruction in the three R’s. Classified by\r\ncourses of study, 1,711--217 in a million--were taking the classical\r\ncourse; 1,200--150 in a million--the scientific; 4,449--555 to the\r\nmillion--the normal course in preparation for teaching; 1,285--160 in\r\na million--professional courses; 9,724 the English course, and 244 the\r\nbusiness course. In each of these courses the colored race has only\r\nabout one fifth or one sixth of its quota. Is there anything in these\r\nfigures to alarm the nation?\r\n\r\nAbout one third of the total number of students in these 161 colored\r\nschools and colleges are taking industrial training. When we consider\r\nthe great demand for educated colored ministers, teachers and\r\nphysicians, and the quick reward for ability in these lines, on the\r\none hand, and the exclusiveness of some trade-unions in shutting\r\nout colored workmen, on the other, the wonder is that one third of\r\nthe total number of colored youth in these schools have chosen the\r\nindustrial course. For it is by no means certain that they will be\r\nallowed to work at their trades after they have learned them.\r\n\r\nThe number of colored students who have had even a smattering of the\r\nhigher education has been shown to be ridiculously small, and the total\r\nnumber of colored graduates with the college degree proper does not at\r\nthe most liberal estimate exceed one thousand. Many of them are dead.\r\nOf the number now living, almost every one can be located in some\r\nuseful and uplifting employment as ministers, teachers, physicians,\r\nlawyers, business men, or as wives presiding over happy, prosperous,\r\ncultured homes which white persons seldom enter except on business.\r\nOur critics seem to know nothing of these homes, which, as a rule, are\r\nowned by their occupants. For the most part these homes are scattered\r\nthroughout the South, and are centers of culture and refinement that\r\nelevate the moral and social status of the entire community.\r\n\r\nTo deprive the youth of the colored race of the higher education is to\r\ndeprive them of all the nobler incentives to study, to sacrifice, to\r\nstruggle to get an education. Every thoughtful person knows that these\r\nincentives are necessary for the white race; they are equally necessary\r\nfor the colored race. Neither the white youth nor the colored, in large\r\nnumbers, will toil and struggle and apply himself to get an education,\r\nunless he sees that education brings power and a better living to its\r\npossessors.\r\n\r\nThe colored race, like every other part of our population, needs all\r\nkinds of education. It is a sheer fallacy and a grievous wrong to them\r\nto hold _all_ of them down to the rudiments of an education, with\r\nindustrial training. All can not profit by the industrial training any\r\nmore than all can profit by the higher training. There is no conflict\r\nbetween the advocates of industrial training and the higher education.\r\nBoth are right. Both are good in their respective spheres. At any\r\nrate, it is not necessary to disparage the magnificent achievements\r\nof colored persons who have received the higher training to make an\r\nargument in favor of training _all_ of them in the manual trades, or to\r\njustify their elimination from politics.\r\n\r\n      ANDREW F. HILGER,\r\n  _Washington, D. C._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_GEOLOGY._\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the general results of Mr. G. K. Gilbert’s\r\ninvestigation of recent earth movements in the Great Lakes region--that\r\nthe whole district is being lifted on one side or depressed on the\r\nother, so that its plane is bodily canted toward the south-southwest,\r\nand that the rate of change is such that the two ends of a line\r\none hundred miles long, running in a south-southwest direction,\r\nare relatively displaced four tenths of a foot in one hundred\r\nyears--certain general consequences ensue. The waters of each lake are\r\ngradually rising on the southern and western shores, or falling on\r\nthe northern and eastern shores, or both. This change is not directly\r\nobvious, because masked by temporary changes due to inequalities of\r\nrainfall and evaporation and various other causes, but it affects the\r\nmean height of the lake surface. In Lake Ontario the water is advancing\r\non all shores, the rate at any place being proportional to its distance\r\nfrom the isobase through the outlet. At Hamilton and Port Dalhousie\r\nit amounts to six inches in a century. The water also advances on all\r\nshores of Lake Erie, most rapidly at Toledo and Sandusky, where the\r\nchange is eight or nine inches a century. All about Lake Huron the\r\nwater is falling, most rapidly at the north and northeast; at Mackinac\r\nthe rate is six inches, and at the mouth of French River ten inches\r\na century. On Lake Superior the isobase of the outlet cuts the shore\r\nat the international boundary; the water is advancing on the American\r\nshore, and sinking on the Canadian. At Duluth the advance is six\r\ninches, and at Huron Bay the recession is five inches a century. The\r\nshores of Lake Michigan are divided by the Port Huron isobase. North\r\nof Oconto and Manistee the water is falling; south of these places it\r\nis rising, the rate at Milwaukee being five or six inches a century,\r\nand at Chicago nine or ten inches. Eventually, unless a dam is erected\r\nto prevent it, Lake Michigan will again overflow to the Illinois\r\nRiver, its discharge occupying the channel carved by the outlet of a\r\nPleistocene glacial lake. The summit in that channel is now about eight\r\nfeet above the mean level of the lake, and the time before it will be\r\novertopped may be computed. For the mean lake stage such discharge will\r\nbegin in about one thousand years, and after fifteen hundred years\r\nthere will be no interruption. In about two thousand years the Illinois\r\nRiver and the Niagara will carry equal portions of the surplus water\r\nof the Great Lakes. In twenty-five hundred years the discharge of the\r\nNiagara will be intermittent, failing at low stages of the lake, and in\r\nthirty-five hundred years there will be no Niagara. The basin of Lake\r\nErie will then be tributary to Lake Huron, the current being reversed\r\nin the Detroit and St. Clair channels.\r\n\r\n\r\n_GEOGRAPHY._\r\n\r\nRelating to the Royal Geographical Society the story of his exploration\r\nof the Bolivian Andes, Sir Martin Conway spoke of his journey by way of\r\nthe Arequipa Railroad, Peru, to Lake Titicaca. That remarkable sheet\r\nof water is fourteen times the size of the Lake of Geneva and twelve\r\nthousand feet above the sea, and might be regarded as the remnant of\r\na far greater inland sea, now shrunk away. Driving from Chililaya, he\r\nreached the snowy mountain called the Cordillera Real--the backbone of\r\nBolivia--which he had come especially to visit, and in the region of\r\nwhich he spent four months. To the east the mountains fell very rapidly\r\nto a low hill country and the fertile valleys that send their waters\r\nto the river Beni. On the other side lay a high plateau, at a uniform\r\naltitude of from twelve thousand to thirteen thousand feet, from which\r\nthe tops of low rocky hills here and there emerged. This plateau had\r\nobviously been at one time submerged; evidence was plentiful that in\r\nancient times the glaciers enveloped a large part of the slopes that\r\nled down to it from the main Cordilleras and reached down many miles\r\nfarther than now. In the immense pile of _débris_ left by the glaciers\r\ndeep valleys were afterward cut by the action of water, and into these\r\nvalleys the glaciers of a second period of advance protruded their\r\nsnouts, depositing moraines that could still be traced _in situ_ as\r\nmuch as four or five miles below the present limit of the ice. Contrary\r\nto the apparently general impression that the peaks of the Cordilleras\r\nwere volcanic, the author had not been able to find any trace of\r\nvolcanic action along the axis of the range. The Cordillera Real had\r\nbeen elevated by a great earth movement, and the heart of the range\r\nconsisted of granites, schists and similar rocks. The whole range might\r\nbe described as highly mineralized. Gold was found at several points,\r\nbut the chief auriferous valleys were those on the east side of the\r\nrange. Just below the snowy mass of Cacaaca on the west was a really\r\nenormous vein of tin; and antimony, cobalt and platinum have been found\r\nin different parts. The great copper deposits were not in this range,\r\nbut farther west. The flora of the high regions of the Cordillera\r\nReal was apparently sparse, but is probably more abundant in the\r\nrainy season. Bird life was more prolific and birds were numerous, at\r\nsuitable places, up to an altitude of seventeen thousand feet above the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_ZOOLOGY._\r\n\r\nThe most recent elementary text-book in zoölogy is from the press of\r\nThe Macmillan Co. Professor and Mrs. Charles B. Davenport are the joint\r\nauthors. It is recognized now-a-days that what the general high school\r\nor elementary student in zoölogy needs is not professional training\r\nin that subject, but rather an opportunity to view the field so that\r\nhe may have as wide an acquaintance as may be of the forms of animals\r\nand of their doings. This he needs that he may have an interest in\r\nthe things of nature and that he may be a more intelligent member of\r\nsociety in the things pertaining to his welfare as affected by animals.\r\nThe book is therefore an attempt to restore the old natural history\r\nin a newer garb. The text is divided into twenty-one chapters. The\r\nfirst of these deals with ‘The Grasshopper and its Allies,’ followed\r\nby others upon the butterfly, beetle, fly, spider, etc., similarly\r\ntreated. Each chapter has one or two ‘keys’--that is, arrangements\r\nwhereby the families of animals may be determined. The book is richly\r\nillustrated by means of half-tone and line reproduction; a number of\r\nphotographs are from life, and one of these is a flash-light photograph\r\nof a slug and an earthworm crawling upon a pavement at night! Outlines\r\nfor simple laboratory work and a list of books dealing with the\r\nclassification and habits of American animals are to be found in an\r\nappendix. Many good things might be said of this contribution to\r\nzoölogical text-books. This ought to be said, that it will be a book\r\nwhich will be of value to any person who, while upon his holiday trip,\r\nwishes to learn about the animals he may come across.\r\n\r\n\r\n_ORNITHOLOGY._\r\n\r\nMr. Chapman is equally at home with camera or pen. In ‘Bird Studies\r\nwith a Camera, with Introductory Chapters on the Outfit and Methods\r\nof the Bird Photographer,’ he gives us some of his many experiences\r\nfrom Central Park to the swamps of Florida and the bare rocks of the\r\nGulf of St. Lawrence. The first two chapters are devoted to a brief\r\ndiscussion of the outfit and methods of the bird photographer, and\r\nthese any one thinking of taking up this branch of art will do well\r\nto read carefully. Mr. Chapman considers that a 4×5 plate is the size\r\nbest adapted for general purposes, and notes that while a lens with\r\nshort focus may serve for photographing nests and eggs, for the birds\r\nthemselves a rapid lens with focus of fourteen to eighteen inches\r\nshould be used. The rest of the book is for the general reader, and\r\ncontains many facts of interest concerning the haunts, habits, and home\r\nlife of a number of birds from the well-known sparrow to the unfamiliar\r\npelican, the accounts of the Bird Rock and Pelican Island being the\r\nmost interesting. Some of the illustrations are a little disappointing,\r\nand emphasize the difficulties of photographing wild birds, but\r\nthere is ample compensation for these in the excellence of others,\r\nparticularly those devoted to Percé, Bonaventure and Bird Rock. This is\r\nequally true of birds and scenery, the views of Percé Rock being the\r\nfinest that have fallen under our notice. Mr. Chapman’s estimate of the\r\nfeathered population of Great Bird Rock, which he puts at 4,000, is by\r\nfar the smallest yet made, and probably has the soundest basis, and\r\nshows a sad diminution from the hosts of fifty years ago.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n‘Bird Homes,’ by A. Radclyffe Dugmore, seems well adapted for its\r\nstated purpose of stimulating the love of birds, helping the ordinary\r\nunscientific person to get some closer glimpses of them, and aiding\r\nin the study of their wonderfully adapted nests and beautiful eggs.\r\nFurthermore, it will probably create a strong desire in the reader to\r\nbecome a photographer of birds and their nests. To further these aims\r\nwe have a first part containing half-a-dozen chapters devoted among\r\nother things to birds’ nests and eggs, photographing nests and young\r\nbirds and the approximate dates when birds begin to nest, this being\r\nadapted to the vicinity of New York.\r\n\r\nFollowing this is the bulk of the volume, containing brief descriptions\r\nof the birds, their nests, nesting places and eggs, and here the author\r\nhas confessedly borrowed from Bendire, Davie and other well-known\r\nauthorities, although one might wish that Mr. Dugmore had introduced\r\nmore of his own observations, since those given incidentally in the\r\nfirst part are very interesting; where he indulges in theory he is\r\nless successful. In place of the usual method of studying the nest\r\nfrom the bird, we have that of studying the bird from the nest, and\r\nfor this purpose the nests are grouped in classes, a chapter being\r\ndevoted to each class; thus we have nests open, on the ground in open\r\nfields, marshes and generally open country; open nests in trees; nests\r\nin bridges, buildings, walls, etc. By this plan any one finding a nest\r\ncan, with a little care and observation, identify the bird that made\r\nit. The illustrations, largely of nests and eggs, are a noteworthy\r\nfeature of the book, although the three-color process which succeeded\r\nso admirably in Dr. Holland’s _Butterfly Book_, is here as equally\r\ndistinct a failure, the least bad of the colored plates being that\r\nshowing the nest of the yellow-breasted chat, the worst that of the\r\nnest of the Baltimore oriole. Those in black and white, however, merit\r\nthe highest praise, and this includes the smaller cuts introduced as\r\ndecorative features in the first portion of the book. It would seem\r\ndifficult in a half-tone to improve on the plate of young crested\r\nflycatchers for clearness of detail, while among others that deserve\r\nspecial mention for artistic effect is the wood thrush on nest, and\r\nthe nests of the chestnut-sided, yellow, blue-winged and worm-eating\r\nwarblers. The general ‘get-up’ of the book is excellent, and the\r\nprinting of the plates separately permits the use of a deadfaced paper\r\nfor the text, which is pleasant to the eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are able to publish in the present issue of the MONTHLY the address\r\ngiven by Mr. G. K. Gilbert as retiring president of the American\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science. The problem that he\r\ndiscusses is one of the most pressing for scientific workers, while at\r\nthe same time it is of interest to everyone, and the address is at once\r\nan important contribution to the subject and an exposition that all can\r\nunderstand. The mathematical physicists find that as an abode fitted\r\nfor life the earth can not be allowed a history indefinitely long--not\r\nlonger perhaps than 20,000,000 years--while the geologists with equally\r\nstrong arguments claim a much greater antiquity. The biologists\r\nare also concerned, owing to the time taken up by the processes of\r\nevolution, and their facts and interests range them with the geologists\r\nrather than with the physicists. The man not versed in science would\r\nalso prefer to assign a long history to the earth, for while he may\r\nbe ready to let the ‘dead past bury its dead,’ he looks forward even\r\nto the distant future, and the shorter the past history of the earth\r\nthe less the time it will continue to be habitable. We have thus a\r\nquestion in the solution of which all the sciences are concerned, and\r\none possessing a dramatic interest that appeals to everyone. The unity\r\nof science is well illustrated by such a problem. It was the subject of\r\nthe address of the retiring president of the Association, a geologist;\r\nit might be taken as the subject for the address of the newly elected\r\npresident, a biologist and student of the processes of evolution;\r\nand it is one to which the president of the meeting, a mathematical\r\nphysicist, has given special attention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Robert Simpson Woodward, who presided over the New York meeting of\r\nthe Association, is professor of mechanics and mathematical physics\r\nand dean of the Faculty of Pure Science in Columbia University. He\r\nwas born at Rochester, Oakland County, Michigan, July 21, 1849,\r\nand spent his early life on a farm with the exception of about two\r\nyears of experience in mercantile and manufacturing pursuits. He was\r\nprepared for college at the Rochester Academy, entered the University\r\nof Michigan in 1868, and was graduated in 1872 with the degree of C.\r\nE. Twenty years later the same institution conferred upon him the\r\ndegree of Ph. D. While yet an undergraduate he entered the U. S. Lake\r\nSurvey, and immediately after graduation he was appointed assistant\r\nengineer in that service. He was employed in the astronomical and\r\ngeodetic work of the Lake Survey until its completion in 1882. He then\r\naccepted the position of assistant astronomer to the U. S. Transit of\r\nVenus Commission and accompanied the expedition of Prof. Asaph Hall,\r\nU. S. N., to San Antonio, Tex., to observe the transit of December,\r\n1882. He remained with the Transit of Venus Commission until 1884,\r\nwhen he resigned in order to take the position of astronomer in the\r\nU. S. Geological Survey. After four years of service in this bureau\r\nhe resigned to accept the position of assistant in the U. S. Coast\r\nand Geodetic Survey. This he held until 1893, when he retired from\r\nthe public service and accepted the call of Columbia University to\r\nthe chair of mechanics. In 1895, and again in 1900, he was elected\r\nto the deanship of the graduate faculty of pure science in that\r\ninstitution. Professor Woodward has published many papers on subjects\r\nin astronomy, geodesy, mathematics and mechanics. He edited, and\r\ncontributed several chapters to the final report of the U. S. Lake\r\nSurvey, a volume of about one thousand quarto pages devoted chiefly to\r\na discussion of the geodetic work of the Survey done during the forty\r\nyears of its existence. He is the author of several of the Bulletins\r\nof the U. S. Geological Survey, and of a memoir on the Iced Bar and\r\nLong Tape Base Apparatus of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey.\r\nThese forms of apparatus, devised and perfected by him, involve many\r\nnovel features and secure a much higher precision at a much smaller\r\ncost than apparatus previously used. He prepared for the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution a volume entitled ‘Geographical Tables,’ being a manual\r\nfor astronomers, geographers, engineers and cartographers, published\r\nin 1894. Several of his most important mathematical papers relate to\r\ngeophysics, especially those bearing on the secular cooling and cubical\r\ncontraction of the earth, on the form and position of the sea surface,\r\nand on the profoundly difficult problem presented by the recently\r\ndiscovered phenomenon of the variation of terrestrial latitudes.\r\nAlthough most of his publications are necessarily of a highly technical\r\ncharacter, his semi-popular addresses and reviews have been widely read\r\nand appreciated. Professor Woodward was an associate editor of the\r\n‘Annals of Mathematics’ from 1889 to 1899 and has been an associate\r\neditor of ‘Science’ since 1894. He has taken an active part in the\r\nwork of the scientific societies with which he is connected, and in\r\naddition to the official positions he holds in the American Association\r\nfor the Advancement of Science, he has been honored by election to the\r\npresidency of the American Mathematical Society and to the presidency\r\nof the New York Academy of Sciences. Professor Woodward represents\r\nthe highest type of the man of science. Eminent for his original\r\ncontributions to science, a teacher of great intellectual and moral\r\ninfluence, an administrator with unfailing tact and unerring judgment,\r\nhe confers an honor on the Association which has elected him to its\r\nhighest office.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Low welcomed the American Association to New York and to\r\nColumbia University in an address which recounted the increased\r\nrecognition given to science by the city since the Association met\r\nthere thirteen years ago and the great progress of science itself. He\r\nconcluded with the following words: “I am especially glad to welcome\r\nyou because you are an Association for the _Advancement_ of Science.\r\nThat, after all, is what ought to make you feel at home in the\r\natmosphere of this university; for a university that does not assist\r\nthe advancement of science has hardly a right to call itself by that\r\ngreat name. I heard Phillips Brooks say, in a sermon that I heard him\r\npreach in Boston when this Association met there twenty years ago,\r\nthat you can get no idea of eternity, by adding century to century or\r\nby piling æon upon æon; but that, if you will remember how little you\r\nknew when you sat at your mother’s knee to learn the alphabet, and how\r\nwith every acquisition of knowledge which has marked the intervening\r\nyears you have come to feel, not how much more you know, but how much\r\nmore there is to be known, all can get some idea of how long eternity\r\ncan be, because all can understand that there never can be time enough\r\nto enable any one to learn all that there is to know. There is so\r\nmuch to be known, that even the great advances of the last generation\r\ndo not make us feel that everything is discovered, but they appeal\r\nto new aspirations and awaken renewed energy in order to make fresh\r\ndiscoveries in a region that teems with so much that is worthy of\r\nknowledge. I congratulate you upon your success, and I bid you welcome\r\nto Columbia.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the course of his reply, the president of the Association, Professor\r\nWoodward, said: “But surprising and gratifying as have been the\r\nachievements of science in our day, their most important indication to\r\nus is that there is indefinite room for improvement and advancement.\r\nWhile we have witnessed the establishment of the two widest\r\ngeneralizations of science, the doctrine of energy and the doctrine\r\nof evolution, we have also witnessed the accumulation of an appalling\r\naggregate of unrelated facts. The proper interpretation of these must\r\nlead to simplification and unification, and thence on to additional\r\ngeneralizations. An almost inevitable result of the rapid developments\r\nof the past three decades especially is that much that goes by the\r\nname of science is quite unscientific. The elementary teaching and\r\nthe popular exposition of science have fallen, unluckily, into the\r\nkeeping largely of those who can not rise above the level of a purely\r\nliterary view of phenomena. Many of the bare facts of science are so\r\nfar stranger than fiction that the general public has become somewhat\r\nover-credulous, and untrained minds fall an easy prey to the tricks\r\nof the magazine romancer or to the schemes of the perpetual motion\r\npromoter. Along with the growth of real science there has gone on also\r\na growth of pseudo-science. It is so much easier to accept sensational\r\nthan to interpret sound scientific literature, so much easier to\r\nacquire the form than it is to possess the substance of thought that\r\nthe deluded enthusiast and the designing charlatan are not infrequently\r\nmistaken by the expectant public for true men of science. There is,\r\ntherefore, plenty of work before us; and while our principal business\r\nis the direct advancement of science, an important, though less\r\nagreeable duty, at times, is the elimination of error and the exposure\r\nof fraud.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the Association in New York was of more than usual\r\nimportance. Not only did the nine sections of the Association hold\r\ntheir daily sessions, but there were also fifteen special scientific\r\nsocieties meeting simultaneously at Columbia University. Men of science\r\ncame together from all parts of the country to present the results of\r\nthe year’s research, to gain profit and pleasure from association with\r\nother workers, and to return to their homes with increased knowledge\r\nand renewed interest. It is obviously impossible to give here an\r\naccount of the hundreds of scientific papers presented, or even to\r\nreport upon the general proceedings of the Association. Two of the more\r\nimportant actions may, however, be mentioned. It was decided to send\r\n‘Science,’ our weekly journal of general science, to all members of the\r\nAssociation without charge, and a section devoted to physiology and\r\nexperimental medicine was established. It was thought that the receipt\r\nof a journal such as ‘Science’ would increase the membership of the\r\nAssociation and lead to a greater interest in its work, as even those\r\nwho are unable to attend the meetings will hereafter have a definite\r\nreturn for membership. The Association will be greatly strengthened\r\nby giving recognition to the great group of sciences--physiology,\r\nexperimental psychology, anatomy, embryology, histology, morphology,\r\npathology, bacteriology and their applications--which have developed\r\nwith such remarkable activity within the past few years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to report on the scientific work of the meeting in\r\npart owing to its magnitude--the papers would fill the volumes of this\r\njournal for several years to come. It is also true that each paper\r\ntaken singly is likely to be of interest only to the special student.\r\nSpecialization in science is absolutely necessary for its advance,\r\nbut the terminology required for exactness and economy makes the work\r\nin each department scarcely intelligible to those not immediately\r\nconcerned, while the great detail necessary in careful research seems\r\nalmost trivial until we realize that it is upon such special work that\r\nthe general principles and the applications of science depend. We all\r\nknow that our ways of thought and habits of life are chiefly based\r\non the results of modern science. This has not been the result of a\r\nsudden revelation, but of a continual growth, scarcely perceptible\r\nuntil viewed from a distance. The importance of current political\r\nevents is magnified by the common interest they excite, whereas in\r\nart, literature and science time is required before things can be\r\nseen in their right perspective. We can, however, take the reports of\r\nthe three committees of the Association to which small grants were\r\nmade for research and use these as examples of the scientific work\r\ndescribed at the meeting. These committees were on ‘Anthropometry,’ on\r\n‘The Quantitative Study of Variation’ and on ‘The Cave Fauna of North\r\nAmerica.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe committee on anthropometry is undertaking to make measurements of\r\nthe physical and mental traits of members of the Association, and to\r\nencourage such work elsewhere. At the present time there exists but\r\nlittle exact knowledge of how people differ from each other and of the\r\ncauses and results of such differences. Much has been written regarding\r\nmen of genius, criminals and other classes, but without an adequate\r\nfoundation of fact. The members of a scientific society are a fairly\r\nhomogeneous class, regarding whose heredity, education and achievements\r\ncorrect information can be secured. The measurements made at the New\r\nYork meeting, determining such traits as size of head, strength,\r\neyesight, quickness of perception, memory, etc., will supply the\r\nstandard type for scientific men and their variations from this type.\r\nWhen other classes of the community have been measured, comparisons can\r\nbe made and we shall know whether scientific men are more variable than\r\nothers, have larger heads, better memory and the like. Work of this\r\ncharacter has been carried on at Columbia University for some years.\r\nThe freshmen, both the men of Columbia College and the women of Barnard\r\nCollege, are measured and tested with care, equal attention being paid\r\nto mental and physical traits. Then the measurements are repeated at\r\nthe end of the senior year. Anthropometric work has also been done in\r\nGreat Britain under the auspices of Dr. Galton and Professor Pearson,\r\nand we may perhaps hope that the time will come when we shall have as\r\nexact knowledge about human differences as we now have about different\r\nkinds of butterflies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough geologists and botanists have defined hundreds of thousands\r\nof species, they have not as a matter of fact until very recently\r\nattempted to secure exact measurements of differences, and the\r\ncommittee of the Association on ‘The Quantitative Study of Variation,’\r\nof which Prof. Chas. B. Davenport is the recorder, aims to encourage\r\nsuch work. It is now over forty years since the facts and arguments\r\npresented in Darwin’s ‘Origin of Species’ paved the way for general\r\nacceptance of the doctrine of evolution. But the objection is hardly\r\nless valid to-day than it was then that the evidence for evolution\r\nis almost wholly indirect. Over and over again naturalists have been\r\nchallenged to cite one case where a species in nature has changed\r\nwithin historic times and repeatedly they have taken refuge in the\r\nplea that the historic period is too short for a noticeable change to\r\nhave taken place. This plea can be accepted, however, only so long as\r\nwe have no exact way of measuring race change. When we can express\r\nquantitatively the condition of a community to-day, we may hope to\r\nbe able to say whether any change has occurred after five, ten, or\r\na hundred years. The committee of the Association has especially\r\nconcerned itself with a piece of work which may be considered typical.\r\nIn the headwaters of the Tennessee River there lives a univalor mollusc\r\nwhich is found nowhere else in the world and which belongs to a family\r\nof molluscs that was early separated from its marine cogeners as a\r\nfluviatile species. This genus, Io, varies greatly in different parts\r\nof the Tennessee basin. In some places it is smooth; in others, spiny;\r\nin others, long drawn out. Under a grant of the Association, Mr. C. C.\r\nAdams, of Bloomington, Ill., visited this region; travelled down one of\r\nthe tributaries in a boat, collecting samples from every community of\r\nIos; and went by train up a second river collecting at every stopping\r\nplace. The results of this trip were, in a word, that in passing from\r\nthe mouth to the headwaters of the two parallel tributaries the shells\r\nvary in parallel fashion and show a uniform, continuous change from the\r\nspiny, elongated condition characteristic of the mouths of the rivers\r\nto the smooth, more globose condition characteristic of the headwaters.\r\nThe additional grant by the Association of one hundred dollars will\r\nassist Mr. Adams in making further quantitative studies on variation in\r\nthe genus Io.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHardly any fact has excited more interest among evolutionists than the\r\nblindness of cave animals; and various theories have been advanced\r\nto explain the fact. It is known that the blind condition is due to\r\na degeneration of formerly functional eyes. The difficulty has been\r\nto understand what advantage is gained by losing the eyes even in a\r\nlocality where eyes are of no use. It has been affirmed that ‘Nature\r\nis economical’ and will not expend energy in building an unnecessary\r\norgan. Weismann has suggested that the only reason why we have eyes at\r\nall is because Natural Selection is constantly weeding out poor eyes.\r\nWithdraw the necessity for good eyes, and poor eyes and good eyes will\r\nhave an equal chance of surviving. According to a third theory, the\r\nfunctional activity of any organ is essential to its maintenance. Just\r\nas the unused arm withers so the unused eye degenerates. Of course all\r\nthese theories assume that the ancestors of the blind species--for\r\ninstance, of the blind fishes--had originally no inherent tendency to\r\nblindness or degeneration of the eyes. This assumption has, however,\r\nbeen recently combatted by Professor Eigenmann, who has shown that\r\nalthough many kinds of fish are accidentally swept into caves, only\r\none kind has become blind; of this kind the nearest allies which live\r\nin open streams shun the light, live in crevices and under stones, and\r\nhave less perfect eyes than other fishes. Some of the allies of such\r\nlight-shunning fishes have made their way into caves, and have there\r\nworked out their tendency to a reduction of eyes. That has been the\r\nhistory of eyeless fishes. To continue the researches of Professor\r\nEigenmann, so auspiciously begun, the Association last year granted\r\none hundred dollars to a committee on the cave vertebrates of North\r\nAmerica. With the aid of the grant Dr. Eigenmann has during the past\r\nyear penetrated into numerous caves and obtained much additional\r\nmaterial for his researches.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe American Association will meet next year at Denver, beginning on\r\nAugust 26th.

Its\r\nmeetings give occasion for discussions of matters of educational\r\ntheory and practice in many ways comparable to the discussions in\r\nscientific societies. The program of the present meeting shows that\r\nlike the scientific associations, the National Educational Association\r\nhas become differentiated into a number of practically isolated\r\nsections with differing interests. There are separate departments of\r\nKindergarten Education, Manual Training, Child Study, Normal Schools,\r\nLibraries, etc. The Department of Superintendence now has a special\r\nmeeting at a different time and place. There are also general sessions,\r\nand these have not become mere formal business meetings. The leading\r\ntopic for discussion this year seems to have been the proposed National\r\nUniversity at Washington. The most obviously important service which\r\nthe Association has rendered to educational endeavor has been its\r\nelaboration (through efficient committees) and publication of reports\r\non Secondary Education, Elementary Education, Rural Schools and College\r\nEntrance Requirements. These reports represent if not demonstrable\r\nfacts, at least the well-considered opinion of competent judges and\r\nthey have had a highly beneficial influence. Dr. J. M. Green, of\r\nNewark, will preside over next year’s meeting. The decision in regard\r\nto the place has been left to the executive committee, the claims of\r\nDetroit, Cincinnati and Tacoma having been especially urged.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe opening of a summer school at Columbia University and the\r\nattendance at Harvard University of a large proportion of all the\r\nschool teachers of Cuba are important steps towards increasing the\r\nusefulness of our institutions for higher education. The grounds,\r\nbuildings and equipment of Columbia University have cost in the\r\nneighborhood of $10,000,000, and to let these lie idle and rusting\r\nfor nearly one-third of the year is evidently wasteful. But it is not\r\nonly a question of the most economical administration of these trust\r\nfunds that is at issue. The teachers of the country, perhaps 500,000\r\nin number, have had just enough education to profit particularly by\r\nattendance at a university. They are engaged at their work during\r\nthree-fourths of the year, but their summers can be spent in no more\r\npleasant and useful way than by attending a university summer school.\r\nIt would be good business policy for school boards to send their\r\nteachers to the summer schools, except that the benefit might not be\r\nreaped locally, as each teacher would soon deserve a better position\r\nthan he now has. It is, however, not only for teachers that university\r\nsessions during the summer are needed. The long vacation is largely a\r\ntradition from the time when boys were most usefully occupied on the\r\nfarm during the summer. It is doubtful whether students now come back\r\nto college in the autumn in an improved physical or moral condition.\r\nThey might spend their time to advantage, but are not likely to do so\r\nat the ordinary summer resort. It is admitted by everyone that young\r\nmen are too old when they leave college and the professional schools.\r\nReforms are needed in various directions, but an obvious one is not to\r\ntake four years for three years’ work. Though university professors,\r\nwho for the general good need freedom from routine teaching for other\r\nwork, should be allowed leave of absence for a part of the year, it\r\ndoes not follow that they should all be away at the same time. It seems\r\nprobable that the example set by the University of Chicago, which holds\r\nfour sessions extending through the year, will be followed by all our\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe third International Conference on a Catalogue of Scientific\r\nLiterature was held in London on June 12th and 13th. It will be\r\nremembered by those who are interested in the organization of science\r\nthat a conference on this subject was called by the Royal Society in\r\n1896 at which it was proposed to undertake by international coöperation\r\na catalogue of contributions to science. Certain details were arranged\r\nand others were left to a committee of the Royal Society. Under the\r\nauspices of this committee schedules of classification were drawn up\r\nand estimates of the cost secured. A second conference was held in\r\n1898, and after various changes in the plans for the catalogue it\r\nwas at the recent Conference definitely decided to proceed with its\r\npublication. It is estimated that the cost will be covered by the sale\r\nof three hundred sets, and different governments or national agencies\r\nhave made themselves responsible for a certain number of sets, Germany\r\nand Great Britain for example, subscribing for forty-five sets, each\r\ncosting £17. The Catalogue will be published in seventeen volumes\r\ndevoted to as many sciences, and will be both an author’s and a subject\r\nindex. The collection of material is to commence from January 1, 1901.\r\nWhile all scientific men welcome improvements in cataloguing scientific\r\nliterature, the arrangements proposed by the Royal Society and by the\r\ndifferent conferences have met with some criticism. The serious mistake\r\nhas been made of entirely ignoring the catalogues and bibliographies\r\nalready existing for most of the sciences, and it is not certain that\r\nthe elaborate and expensive machinery proposed will be as useful as\r\nsome plan would have been for unifying the existing agencies. Still\r\nin the end there must be some international and uniform method for\r\ncataloguing scientific literature, and it is to be hoped that our\r\nGovernment will do its share toward supporting the present undertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscribers’ Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a\r\npredominant preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced\r\nquotation marks retained.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.\r\n\r\nPage 342: “millenium” was printed that way.\r\n\r\nPage 366: “to smear the statues of Jupiter” was misprinted as\r\n“statutes”.\r\n\r\nPage 387: “we have meet with a difficulty” was printed that way.\r\n\r\nPage 387: “cm.” originally was printed as “c. m.”",
