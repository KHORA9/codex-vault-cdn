CURTLER\r\n\r\n\r\n  OXFORD\r\n  AT THE CLARENDON PRESS\r\n  1909\r\n\r\n\r\n  HENRY FROWDE, M.A.\r\n  PUBLISHER TO THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD\r\n  LONDON, EDINBURGH, NEW YORK\r\n  TORONTO AND MELBOURNE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\n'A husbandman', said Markham, 'is the master of the earth, turning\r\nbarrenness into fruitfulness, whereby all commonwealths are\r\nmaintained and upheld. His labour giveth liberty to all vocations,\r\narts, and trades to follow their several functions with peace and\r\nindustrie. What can we say in this world is profitable where\r\nhusbandry is wanting, it being the great nerve and sinew which\r\nholdeth together all the joints of a monarchy?' And he is confirmed\r\nby Young: 'Agriculture is, beyond all doubt, the foundation of every\r\nother art, business, and profession, and it has therefore been the\r\nideal policy of every wise and prudent people to encourage it to the\r\nutmost.' Yet of this important industry, still the greatest in\r\nEngland, there is no history covering the whole period.\r\n\r\nIt is to remedy this defect that this book is offered, with much\r\ndiffidence, and with many thanks to Mr. C.R.L. Fletcher of Magdalen\r\nCollege, Oxford, for his valuable assistance in revising the proof\r\nsheets, and to the Rev. A.H. Johnson of All Souls for some very\r\nuseful information.\r\n\r\nAs the agriculture of the Middle Ages has often been ably described,\r\nI have devoted the greater part of this work to the agricultural\r\nhistory of the subsequent period, especially the seventeenth,\r\neighteenth, and nineteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nW.H.R.

Co-operation in agriculture\r\nwas necessary because to each household were allotted separate strips\r\nof land, nearly equal in size, in each field set apart for tillage,\r\nand a share in the meadow and waste land. The strips of arable were\r\nunfenced and ploughed by common teams, to which each family would\r\ncontribute.\r\n\r\nApparently, as the land was cleared and broken up it was dealt out\r\nacre by acre to each cultivator; and supposing each group consisted of\r\nten families, the typical holding of 120 acres was assigned to each\r\nfamily in acre strips, and these strips were not all contiguous but\r\nmixed up with those of other families. The reason for this mixture of\r\nstrips is obvious to any one who knows how land even in the same field\r\nvaries in quality; it was to give each family its share of both good\r\nand bad land, for the householders were all equal and the principle on\r\nwhich the original distribution of the land depended was that of\r\nequalizing the shares of the different members of the community.[2]\r\n\r\nIn attributing ownership of lands to communities we must be careful\r\nnot to confound communities with corporations. Maitland thinks the\r\nearly land-owning communities blended the character of corporations\r\nand of co-owners, and co-ownership is ownership by individuals.[3] The\r\nvills or villages founded on their arrival in Britain by our English\r\nforefathers resembled those they left at home, and even there the\r\nstrips into which the arable fields were divided were owned in\r\nseveralty by the householders of the village. There was co-operation\r\nin working the fields but no communistic division of the crops, and\r\nthe individual's hold upon his strips developed rapidly into an\r\ninheritable and partible ownership. 'At the opening of Anglo-Saxon\r\nhistory absolute ownership of land in severalty was established and\r\nbecoming the rule.'[4]\r\n\r\nIn the management of the meadow land communal features were much more\r\nclearly brought out; the arable was not reallotted,[5] but the meadow\r\nwas, annually; while the woods and pastures, the right of using which\r\nbelonged to the householders of the village, were owned by the village\r\n'community'. There may have been at the time of the English conquest\r\nRoman 'villas' with slaves and _coloni_ cultivating the owners'\r\ndemesnes, which passed bodily to the new masters; but the former\r\ntheory seems true of the greater part of the country.\r\n\r\nAt first 'extensive' cultivation was practised; that is, every year a\r\nfresh arable field was broken up and the one cultivated last year\r\nabandoned, for a time at all events; but gradually 'intensive' culture\r\nsuperseded this, probably not till after the English had conquered the\r\nland, and the same field was cultivated year after year.[6] After the\r\nvarious families or households had finished cutting the grass in their\r\nallotted portions of meadow, and the corn on their strips of tillage,\r\nboth grass and stubble became common land and were thrown open for the\r\nwhole community to turn their stock upon.\r\n\r\nThe size of the strips of land in the arable fields varied, but was\r\ngenerally an acre, in most places a furlong (furrow long) or 220 yards\r\nin length, and 22 yards broad; or in other words, 40 rods of 5-1/2\r\nyards in length and 4 in breadth. There was, however, little\r\nuniformity in measurement before the Norman Conquest, the rod by which\r\nthe furlongs and acres were measured varying in length from 12 to 24\r\nfeet, so that one acre might be four times as large as another.[7] The\r\nacre was, roughly speaking, the amount that a team could plough in a\r\nday, and seems to have been from early times the unit of measuring the\r\narea of land.[8] Of necessity the real acre and the ideal acre were\r\nalso different, for the reason that the former had to contend with the\r\ninequalities of the earth's surface and varied much when no scientific\r\nmeasurement was possible. As late as 1820 the acre was of many\r\ndifferent sizes in England. In Bedfordshire it was 2 roods, in Dorset\r\n134 perches instead of 160, in Lincolnshire 5 roods, in Staffordshire\r\n2-1/4 acres. To-day the Cheshire acre is 10,240 square yards. As,\r\nhowever, an acre was and is a day's ploughing for a team, we may\r\nassume that the most usual acre was the same area then as now. There\r\nwere also half-acre strips, but whatever the size the strips were\r\ndivided one from another by narrow grass paths generally called\r\n'balks', and at the end of a group of these strips was the 'headland'\r\nwhere the plough turned, the name being common to-day. Many of these\r\ncommon fields remained until well on in the nineteenth century; in\r\n1815 half the county of Huntingdon was in this condition, and a few\r\nstill exist.[9] Cultivating the same field year after year naturally\r\nexhausted the soil, so that the two-field system came in, under which\r\none was cultivated and the other left fallow; and this was followed by\r\nthe three-field system, by which two were cropped in any one year and\r\none lay fallow, the last-named becoming general as it yielded better\r\nresults, though the former continued, especially in the North. Under\r\nthe three-field plan the husbandman early in the autumn would plough\r\nthe field that had been lying fallow during summer, and sow wheat or\r\nrye; in the spring he broke up the stubble of the field on which the\r\nlast wheat crop had been grown and sowed barley or oats; in June he\r\nploughed up the stubble of the last spring crop and fallowed the\r\nfield.[10] As soon as the crops began to grow in the arable fields and\r\nthe grass in the meadows to spring, they were carefully fenced to\r\nprevent trespass of man and beast; and, as soon as the crops came off,\r\nthe fields became common for all the village to turn their stock upon,\r\nthe arable fields being usually common from Lammas (August 1) to\r\nCandlemas (February 2) and the meadows from July 6, old Midsummer Day,\r\nto Candlemas[11]; but as in this climate the season both of hay and\r\ncorn harvest varies considerably, these dates cannot have been fixed.\r\n\r\nThe stock, therefore, besides the common pasture, had after harvest\r\nthe grazing of the common arable fields and of the meadows. The common\r\npasture was early 'stinted' or limited, the usual custom being that\r\nthe villager could turn out as many stock as he could keep on his\r\nholding. The trouble of pulling up and taking down these fences every\r\nyear must have been enormous, and we find legislation on this\r\nimportant matter at an early date. About 700 the laws of Ine, King of\r\nWessex, provided that if 'churls have a common meadow or other\r\npartible land to fence, and some have fenced their part and some have\r\nnot, and cattle stray in and eat up their common corn or grass; let\r\nthose go who own the gap and compensate to the others who have fenced\r\ntheir part the damage which then may be done, and let them demand such\r\njustice on the cattle as may be right. But if there be a beast which\r\nbreaks hedges and goes in everywhere, and he who owns it will not or\r\ncannot restrain it, let him who finds it in his field take it and slay\r\nit, and let the owner take its skin and flesh and forfeit the rest.'\r\n\r\nEngland was not given over to one particular type of settlement,\r\nalthough villages were more common than hamlets in the greater part of\r\nthe country.[12] The vill or village answers to the modern civil\r\nparish, and the term may be applied to both the true or 'nucleated'\r\nvillage of clustered houses and the village of scattered hamlets, each\r\nof a few houses, existing chiefly on the Celtic fringe. The population\r\nof some of the villages at the time of the Norman Conquest was\r\nnumerous, 100 households or 500 people; but the average townships\r\ncontained from 10 to 20 households.[13] There was also the single\r\nfarm, such as that at Eardisley in Herefordshire, described in\r\nDomesday, lying in the middle of a forest, perhaps, as in other\r\nsimilar cases, a pioneer settlement of some one more adventurous than\r\nhis fellows.[14]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch was the early village community in England, a community of free\r\nlandholders. But a change began early to come over it.[15] The king\r\nwould grant to a church all the rights he had in the village,\r\nreserving only the _trinoda necessitas_, these rights including the\r\nfeorm or farm, or provender rent which the king derived from the\r\nland--of cattle, sheep, swine, ale, honey, &c.--which he collected by\r\nvisiting his villages, thus literally eating his rents. The churchmen\r\ndid not continue these visits, they remained in their monasteries, and\r\nhad the feorm brought them regularly; they had an overseer in the\r\nvillage to see to this, and so they tightened their hold on the\r\nvillage. Then the smaller people, the peasants, make gifts to the\r\nChurch. They give their land, but they also want to keep it, for it is\r\ntheir livelihood; so they surrender the land and take it back as a\r\nlifelong loan. Probably on the death of the donor his heirs are\r\nsuffered to hold the land. Then labour services are substituted for\r\nthe old provender rents, and thus the Church acquires a demesne, and\r\nthus the foundations of the manorial system, still to be traced all\r\nover the country, were laid. Thegns, the predecessors of the Norman\r\nbarons, become the recipients of grants from the churches and from\r\nkings, and householders 'commend' themselves and their land to them\r\nalso, so that they acquired demesnes. This 'commendation' was\r\nfurthered by the fact that during the long-drawn out conquest of\r\nBritain the old kindred groups of the English lost their corporate\r\nsense, and the central power being too weak to protect the ordinary\r\nhouseholder, who could not stand alone, he had to seek the protection\r\nof an ecclesiastical corporation or of some thegn, first for himself\r\nand then for his land. The jurisdictional rights of the king also\r\npassed to the lord, whether church or thegn; then came the danegeld,\r\nthe tax for buying off the Danes that subsequently became a fixed land\r\ntax, which was collected from the lord, as the peasants were too poor\r\nfor the State to deal with them; the lord paid the geld for their\r\nland, consequently their land was his. In this way the free ceorl of\r\nAnglo-Saxon times gradually becomes the 'villanus' of Domesday.\r\nLandlordship was well established in the two centuries before the\r\nConquest, and the land of England more or less 'carved into\r\nterritorial lordships'.[16] Therefore when the Normans brought their\r\nwonderful genius for organization to this country they found the\r\nmaterial conditions of manorial life in full growth; it was their task\r\nto develop its legal and economic side.[17]\r\n\r\nAs the manorial system thus superimposed upon the village community\r\nwas the basis of English rural economy for centuries, there need be no\r\napology for describing it at some length.\r\n\r\nThe term 'manor', which came in with the Conquest,[18] has a technical\r\nmeaning in Domesday, referring to the system of taxation, and did not\r\nalways coincide with the vill or village, though it commonly did so,\r\nexcept in the eastern portion of England. The village was the agrarian\r\nunit, the manor the fiscal unit; so that where the manor comprised\r\nmore than one village, as was frequently the case, there would be more\r\nthan one village organization for working the common fields.[19]\r\n\r\nThe manor then was the 'constitutive cell' of English mediaeval\r\nsociety.[20] The structure is always the same; under the headship of\r\nthe lord we find two layers of population, the villeins and the\r\nfreeholders; and the territory is divided into demesne land and\r\ntributary land of two classes, viz. that of the villeins and that of\r\nthe freeholders. The cultivation of the demesne (which usually means\r\nthe land directly occupied and cultivated by the lord, though legally\r\nit has a wider meaning and includes the villein tenements), depends to\r\na certain extent on the work supplied by the tenants of the tributary\r\nland. Rents are collected, labour superintended, administrative\r\nbusiness transacted by a set of manorial officers.\r\n\r\nWe may divide the tillers of the soil at the time of Domesday into\r\nfive great classes[21] in order of dignity and freedom:\r\n\r\n  1. Liberi homines, or freemen.\r\n  2. Socmen.\r\n  3. Villeins.\r\n  4. Bordarii, cotarii, buri or coliberti.\r\n  5. Slaves.\r\n\r\nThe two first of these classes were to be found in large numbers in\r\nNorfolk, Suffolk, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, and\r\nNorthamptonshire. It is not easy to draw the line between them, but\r\nthe chief distinction lay in the latter being more burdened with\r\nservice and customary dues and more especially subject to the\r\njurisdictional authority of the lord.[22] They were both free, but\r\nboth rendered services to the lord for their land. Both the freemen\r\nand the slaves by 1086 were rapidly decreasing in number.\r\n\r\nThe most numerous class[23] on the manors was the third, that of the\r\nvilleins or non-free tenants, who held their land by payment of\r\nservices to the lord. The position of the villein under the feudal\r\nsystem is most complicated. He both was and was not a freeman. He was\r\nabsolutely at the disposal of the lord, who could sell him with his\r\ntenement, and he could not leave his land without his lord's\r\npermission. He laboured under many disabilities, such as the merchet\r\nor fine for marrying his daughter, and fines for selling horse or ox.\r\nOn the other hand, he was free against every one but his lord, and\r\neven against the lord was protected from the forfeiture of his\r\n'wainage' or instruments of labour and from injury to life and\r\nlimb.[24]\r\n\r\nHis usual holding was a virgate of 30 acres of arable, though the\r\nvirgate differed in size even in the same manors; but in addition to\r\nthis he would have his meadow land and his share in the common pasture\r\nand wood, altogether about 100 acres of land. For this he rendered the\r\nfollowing services to the lord of the manor:\r\n\r\n1. Week work, or labour on the lord's demesne for two or three days a\r\nweek during most of the year, and four or five days in summer. It was\r\nnot always the villein himself, however, who rendered these services,\r\nhe might send his son or even a hired labourer; and it was the holding\r\nand not the holder that was considered primarily responsible for the\r\nrendering of services.[25]\r\n\r\n2. Precarii or boon days: that is, work generally during harvest, at\r\nthe lord's request, sometimes instead of week work, sometimes in\r\naddition.\r\n\r\n3. Gafol or tribute: fixed payments in money or kind, and such\r\nservices as 'fold soke', which forced the tenants' sheep to lie on the\r\nlord's land for the sake of the manure; and suit of mill, by which the\r\ntenant was bound to grind his corn in the lord's mill.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the 'boon days' in harvest, it should be remembered\r\nthat harvest time in the Middle Ages was a most important event.\r\nAgriculture was the great industry, and when the corn was ripe the\r\nwhole village turned out to gather it, the only exceptions being the\r\nhousewives and sometimes the marriageable daughters. Even the larger\r\ntowns suspended work that the townsmen might assist in the harvest,\r\nand our long vacation was probably intended originally to cover the\r\nwhole work of gathering in the corn and hay. On the occasion of the\r\n'boon-day' work, the lord usually found food for the labourers which,\r\nthe Inquisition of Ardley[26] tells us, might be of the following\r\ndescription: for two men, porridge of beans and peas and two loaves,\r\none white, the other of 'mixtil' bread; that is, wheat, barley, and\r\nrye mixed together, with a piece of meat, and beer for their first\r\nmeal. Then in the evening they had a small loaf of mixtil bread and\r\ntwo 'lescas' of cheese. While harvest work was going on the better-off\r\ntenants, usually the free ones, were sometimes employed to ride about,\r\nrod in hand, superintending the others.\r\n\r\nThe services of the villeins were often very comprehensive, and even\r\nincluded such tasks as preparing the lord's bath; but on some manors\r\ntheir services were very light.[27] When the third of the above\r\nobligations, the gafol or tribute, was paid in kind it was most\r\ncommonly made in corn; and next came honey, one of the most important\r\narticles of the Middle Ages, as it was used for both lighting and\r\nsweetening purposes. Ale was also common, and poultry and eggs, and\r\nsometimes the material for implements.\r\n\r\nThese obligations were imposed for the most part on free and unfree\r\ntenants alike, though those of the free were much lighter than those\r\nof the unfree; the chief difference between the two, as far as tenure\r\nof the land went, lay in the fact that the former could exercise\r\nproprietary rights over his holding more or less freely, the latter\r\nhad none.[28] It seems very curious to the modern mind that the\r\nvillein, a man who farmed about 100 acres of land, should have been in\r\nsuch a servile condition.\r\n\r\nThe amount of work due from each villein came to be fixed by the\r\nextent or survey of the manor, but the quality of it was not[29];\r\nthat is, each one knew how many days he had to work, but not whether\r\nhe was to plough, sow, or harrow, &c. It is surprising to find, that\r\non the festival days of the Church, which were very numerous and\r\nobserved as holy days, the lord lost by no work being done, and the\r\nsame was the case in wet weather.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important duties of the tenant was the 'averagium', or\r\nduty of carrying for the lord, especially necessary when his manors\r\nwere often a long way apart. He would often have to carry corn to the\r\nnearest town for sale, the products of one manor to another, also to\r\nhaul manure on to the demesne. If he owned neither horse nor ox, he\r\nwould sometimes have to use his own back.[30]\r\n\r\nThe holding of the villein did not admit of partition by sale or\r\ndescent, it remained undivided and entire. When the holder died all\r\nthe land went to one of the sons if there were several, often to the\r\nyoungest. The others sought work on the manor as craftsmen or\r\nlabourers, or remained on the family plot. The holding therefore might\r\ncontain more than one family, but to the lord remained one and\r\nundivided.[31]\r\n\r\nIn the fourth class came the bordarii, the cotarii, and the coliberti\r\nor buri; or, as we should say, the crofters, the cottagers, and the\r\nboors.\r\n\r\nThe bordarii numbered 82,600 in Domesday, and were subject to the same\r\nkind of services as the villeins, but the amount of the service was\r\nconsiderably less.[32] Their usual holding was 5 acres, and they are\r\nvery often found on the demesne of the manor, evidently in this case\r\nlabourers on the demesne, settled in cottages and provided with a bit\r\nof land of their own. The name failed to take root in this country,\r\nand the bordarii seem to become villeins or cottiers.[33]\r\n\r\nThe cotarii, cottiers or cottagers, were 6,800 in number, with small\r\npieces of land sometimes reaching 5 acres.[34] Distinctly inferior to\r\nthe villeins, bordarii, and cottars, but distinctly superior to the\r\nslaves, were the buri or coliberti who, with the bordars and cottars,\r\nwould form a reserve of labour to supplement the ordinary working days\r\nat times when work was pressing, as in hay time and harvest. At the\r\nbottom of the social ladder in Domesday came the slaves, some 25,000\r\nin number, who in the main had no legal rights, a class which had\r\napparently already diminished and was diminishing in numbers, so that\r\nfor the cultivation of the demesne the lord was coming to rely more on\r\nthe labour of his tenants, and consequently the labour services of the\r\nvilleins were being augmented.[35] The agricultural labourer as we\r\nunderstand him, a landless man working solely for wages in cash, was\r\nalmost unknown.\r\n\r\nAll the arrangements of the manor aimed at supplying labour for the\r\ncultivation of the lord's demesne, and he had three chief officers to\r\nsuperintend it:\r\n\r\n1. The seneschal, who answers to our modern steward or land agent, and\r\nwhere there were several manors supervised all of them. He attended to\r\nthe legal business and held the manor courts. It was his duty to be\r\nacquainted with every particular of the manor, its cultivation,\r\nextent, number of teams, condition of the stock, &c. He was also the\r\nlegal adviser of his lord; in fact, very much like his modern\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\n2. The bailiff for each manor, who collected rents, went to market to\r\nbuy and sell, surveyed the timber, superintended the ploughing,\r\nmowing, reaping, &c., that were due as services from the tenants on\r\nthe lord's demesne; and according to _Fleta_ he was to prevent their\r\n'casting off before the work was done', and to measure it when\r\ndone.[36] And considering that those he superintended were not paid\r\nfor their work, but rendering more or less unwelcome services, his\r\ntask could not have been easy.\r\n\r\n3. The praepositus or reeve, an office obligatory on every holder of a\r\ncertain small quantity of land; a sort of foreman nominated from among\r\nthe villeins, and to a certain extent representing their interests.\r\nHis duties were supplementary to those of the bailiff: he looked after\r\nall the live and dead stock of the manor, saw to the manuring of the\r\nland, kept a tally of the day's work, had charge of the granary, and\r\ndelivered therefrom corn to be baked and malt to be brewed.[37]\r\nBesides these three officers, on a large estate there would be a\r\nmessor who took charge of the harvest, and many lesser officers, such\r\nas those of the akermanni, or leaders of the unwieldy plough teams;\r\noxherds, shepherds, and swineherds to tend cattle, sheep, and pigs\r\nwhen they were turned on the common fields or wandered in the waste;\r\nalso wardens of the woods and fences, often paid by a share in the\r\nprofits connected with their charge; for instance, the swineherd of\r\nGlastonbury Abbey received a sucking-pig a year, the interior parts of\r\nthe best pig, and the tails of all the others slaughtered.[38] On the\r\ngreat estates these offices tended to become hereditary, and many\r\nfamilies did treat them as hereditary property, and were a great\r\nnuisance in consequence to their lords. At Glastonbury we find the\r\nchief shepherd so important a person that he was party to an agreement\r\nconcerning a considerable quantity of land.[39] There were also on\r\nsome manors 'cadaveratores', whose duty was to look into and report on\r\nthe losses of cattle and sheep from murrain, a melancholy tale of the\r\nunhealthy conditions of agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe supervision of the tenants was often incessant and minute.\r\nAccording to the Court Rolls of the Manor of Manydown in Hampshire,\r\ntenants were brought to book for all kinds of transgressions. The\r\nfines are so numerous that it almost appears that every person on the\r\nestate was amerced from time to time. In 1365 seven tenants were\r\nconvicted of having pigs in their lord's crops, one let his horse run\r\nin the growing corn, two had cattle among the peas, four had cattle on\r\nthe lord's pasture, three had made default in rent or service, four\r\nwere convicted of assault, nine broke the assize of beer, two had\r\nfailed to repair their houses or buildings. In all thirty-four were in\r\ntrouble out of a population of some sixty families. The account is\r\neloquent of the irritating restrictions of the manor, and of the\r\ninconveniences of common farming.[40]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to compare the receipts of the lord of the manor at\r\nthis period with modern rents, or the position of the villein with the\r\nagricultural labourer; it may be said that the lord received a labour\r\nrent for the villein's holding, or that the villein received his\r\nholding as wages for the services done for the lord,[41] and part of\r\nthe return due to the lord was for the use of the oxen with which he\r\nhad stocked the villein's holding.\r\n\r\nThough in 1066 there were many free villages, yet by the time of\r\nDomesday they were fast disappearing and there were manors everywhere,\r\nusually coinciding with the village which we may picture to ourselves\r\nas self-sufficing estates, often isolated by stretches of dense\r\nwoodland and moor from one another, and making each veritably a little\r\nworld in itself. At the same time it is evident from the extent of\r\narable land described in Domesday that many manors were not greatly\r\nisolated, and pasture ground was often common to two or more\r\nvillages.[42]\r\n\r\nIf we picture to ourselves the typical manor, we shall see a large\r\npart of the lord's demesne forming a compact area within which stood\r\nhis house; this being in addition to the lord's strips in the open\r\nfields intermixed with those of his tenants. The mansion house was\r\nusually a very simple affair, built of wood and consisting chiefly of\r\na hall; which even as late as the seventeenth century in some cases\r\nserved as kitchen, dining room, parlour, and sleeping room for the\r\nmen; and one or two other rooms.[43] It is probable that in early\r\ntimes the thegns possessed in most cases only one manor apiece,[44] so\r\nthat the manor house was then nearly always inhabited by the lord, but\r\nafter the Conquest, when manors were bestowed by scores and even\r\nhundreds by William on his successful soldiers, many of them can only\r\nhave acted as the temporary lodging of the lord when he came to\r\ncollect his rent, or as the house of the bailiff. According to the\r\n_Gerefa_, written about 1000--and there was very little alteration for\r\na long time afterwards--the mansion was adjacent to a court or yard\r\nwhich the quadrangular homestead surrounded with its barns, horse and\r\ncattle stalls, sheep pens and fowlhouse. Within this court were ovens,\r\nkilns, salt-house, and malt-house, and perhaps the hayricks and wood\r\npiles. Outside and surrounding the homestead were the enclosed arable\r\nand grass fields of the portion of the demesne which may be called the\r\nhome farm, a kitchen garden, and probably a vineyard, then common in\r\nEngland. The garden of the manor house would not have a large variety\r\nof vegetables; some onions, leeks, mustard, peas, perhaps cabbage; and\r\napples, pears, cherries, probably damsons, plums,[45] strawberries,\r\npeaches, quinces, and mulberries. Not far off was the village or town\r\nof the tenants, the houses all clustering close together, each house\r\nstanding in a toft or yard with some buildings, and built of wood,\r\nturf, clay, or wattles, with only one room which the tenant shared\r\nwith his live stock, as in parts of Ireland to-day. Indeed, in some\r\nparts of Yorkshire at the beginning of the nineteenth century this\r\nprimitive simplicity still prevailed, live stock were still kept in\r\nthe house, the floors were of clay, and the family slept in boxes\r\nround the solitary room. Examples of farmhouses clustered together at\r\nsome distance from their respective holdings still survive, though\r\ngenerally built of stone. Next the village, though not always, for\r\nthey were sometimes at a distance by the banks of a stream, were the\r\nmeadows, and right round stretched the three open arable fields,\r\nbeyond which was the common pasture and wood,[46] and, encircling all,\r\nheath, forest, and swamp, often cutting off the manor from the rest of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe basis of the whole scheme of measurement in Domesday was the hide,\r\nusually of 120 acres, the amount of land that could be ploughed by a\r\nteam of 8 oxen in a year; a quarter of this was the virgate, an eighth\r\nthe bovate, which would therefore supply one ox to the common team.\r\nThese teams, however, varied; on the manors of S. Paul's Cathedral in\r\n1222 they were sometimes composed of horses and oxen, or of 6 horses\r\nonly, sometimes 10 oxen.[47]\r\n\r\nThe farming year began at Michaelmas when, in addition to the sowing\r\nof wheat and rye, the cattle were carefully stalled and fed only on\r\nhay and straw, for roots were in the distant future, and the corn was\r\nthreshed with the flail and winnowed by hand. In the spring, after the\r\nploughing of the second arable field, the vineyard, where there was\r\none, was set out, and the open ditches, apparently the only drainage\r\nthen known, cleansed. In May it was time to set up the temporary\r\nfences round the meadows and arable fields, and to begin fallowing the\r\nthird field.\r\n\r\nA valuable document, describing the duties of a reeve, gives many\r\ninteresting details of eleventh-century farming:--\r\n\r\n     'In May, June, and July one may harrow, carry out manure, set\r\n     up sheep hurdles, shear sheep, do repairs, hedge, cut wood,\r\n     weed, and make folds. In harvest one may reap; in August,\r\n     September, and in October one may mow, set woad with a dibble,\r\n     gather home many crops, thatch them and cover them over,\r\n     cleanse the folds, prepare cattle sheds and shelters ere too\r\n     severe a winter come to the farm, and also diligently prepare\r\n     the soil. In winter one should plough and in severe frosts\r\n     cleave timber, make an orchard, and do many affairs indoors,\r\n     thresh, cleave wood, put the cattle in stalls and the swine in\r\n     pigstyes, and provide a hen roost. In spring one should plough\r\n     and graft, sow beans, set a vineyard, make ditches, hew wood\r\n     for a wild deer fence; and soon after that, if the weather\r\n     permit, set madder, sow flax seed and woad seed, plant a garden\r\n     and do many things which I cannot fully enumerate that a good\r\n     steward ought to provide.'[48]\r\n\r\nThe methods of cultivation were simple. The plough, if we may judge by\r\ncontemporary illustrations, had in the eleventh century a large wheel\r\nand very short handles.[49] In the twelfth century Neckham describes\r\nits parts: a beam, handles, tongue, mouldboard, coulter, and\r\nshare.[50] Breaking up the clods was done by the mattock or beetle,\r\nand harrowing was done by hand with what looks like a large rake; the\r\nscythes of the haymakers and the sickles of the reapers were very like\r\nthose that still linger on in some districts to-day.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of tools and implements for the homestead: an axe,\r\nadze, bill, awl, plane, saw, spokeshave, tie hook, auger, mattock,\r\nlever, share, coulter, goad-iron, scythe, sickle, weed-hook, spade,\r\nshovel, woad dibble, barrow, besom, beetle, rake, fork, ladder, horse\r\ncomb, shears, fire tongs, weighing scales, and a long list of spinning\r\nimplements necessary when farmers made their own clothes. The author\r\nwisely remarks that one ought to have coverings for wains, plough\r\ngear, harrowing tackle, &c.; and adds another list of instruments and\r\nutensils: a caldron, kettle, ladle, pan, crock, firedog, dishes, bowls\r\nwith handles, tubs, buckets, a churn, cheese vat, baskets, crates,\r\nbushels, sieves, seed basket, wire sieve, hair sieve, winnowing fans,\r\ntroughs, ashwood pails, hives, honey bins, beer barrels, bathing tub,\r\ndishes, cups, strainers, candlesticks, salt cellar, spoon case, pepper\r\nhorn, footstools, chairs, basins, lamp, lantern, leathern bottles,\r\ncomb, iron bin, fodder rack, meal ark or box, oil flask, oven rake,\r\ndung shovel; altogether a very complete list, the compiler of which\r\nends by saying that the reeve ought to neglect nothing that should\r\nprove useful, not even a mousetrap, nor even, what is less, a peg for\r\na hasp.\r\n\r\nManors in 1086 were of all sizes, from one virgate to enormous\r\norganizations like Taunton or Leominster, containing villages by the\r\nscore and hundreds of dependent holdings.[51] The ordinary size,\r\nhowever, of the Domesday manor was from four to ten hides of 120 acres\r\neach, or say from 500 to 1,200 acres,[52] and the Manor of Segenehou\r\nin Bedfordshire may be regarded as typical. Held by Walter brother of\r\nSeiher it had as much land as ten ploughs could work, four plough\r\nlands belonging to the demesne and six to the villeins, of whom there\r\nwere twenty-four, with four bordarii and three serfs; thus the\r\nvilleins had 30 acres each, the normal holding. The manorial system\r\nwas in fact a combination of large farming by the lords, and small\r\nfarming by the tenants. Nor must we compare it to an ordinary estate;\r\nfor it was a dominion within which the lord had authority over\r\nsubjects of various ranks; he was not only a proprietor but a prince\r\nwith courts of his own, the arbiter of his tenants' rights as well as\r\nowner of the land.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking features of the Domesday survey is the large\r\nquantity of arable land and the small quantity of meadow, which\r\nusually was the only land whence they obtained their hay, for the\r\ncommon pasture cannot often have been mown.[53] Indeed, it is\r\ndifficult to understand how they fed their stock in hard winters.\r\n\r\nAccording to the returns, in many counties more acres were ploughed in\r\n1086 than to-day; in some twice as much. In Somerset in 1086 there\r\nwere 577,000 acres of arable; in 1907, 178,967. In Gloucestershire, in\r\n1086, 589,000 acres; in 1907, 238,456.[54] These are extreme\r\ninstances; but the preponderance of arable is startling, even if we\r\nallow for the recent conversion of arable to pasture on account of the\r\nlow price of corn. Between the eleventh century and the sixteenth, the\r\nlaying down of land to grass must have proceeded on a gigantic scale,\r\nfor Harrison tells us that in his day England was mainly a grazing\r\ncountry. No wonder Harrison's contemporaries complained of the decay\r\nof tillage.\r\n\r\nMediaeval prices and statistics are, it is well known, to be taken\r\nwith great caution; but we may assume that the normal annual value of\r\nland under cultivation in 1086 was about 2d. an acre.[55] Land indeed,\r\napart from the stock upon it, was worth very little: in the tenth and\r\neleventh centuries it appears that the hide, normally of 120 acres,\r\nwas only worth £5 to buy, apparently with the stock upon it. In the\r\ntime of Athelstan a horse was worth 120d., an ox 30d., a cow 20d., a\r\nsheep 5d., a hog 8d., a slave £1--so that a slave was worth 8\r\noxen[56]; and these prices do not seem to have advanced by the\r\nDomesday period.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Pipe Roll of 1156, wheat was 1s. 6d. a quarter; but\r\nprices then depended entirely on seasons, and we do not know whether\r\nthat was good or bad. However, many years later, in 1243 it was only\r\n2s. a quarter at Hawsted.[57] In dear years, nearly always the result\r\nof wet seasons, it went up enormously; in 1024 the English Chronicle\r\ntells us the acre seed of wheat, that is about 2 bushels, sold for\r\n4s.,[58] 3 bushels of barley for 6s. and 4 bushels of oats for 4s. In\r\n1190 Holinshed says that, owing to a great dearth, the quarter of\r\nwheat was 18s. 8d. The average price, however, in the twelfth century\r\nwas probably about 4s. a quarter.\r\n\r\nIn 1194 Roger of Hoveden[59] says an ox, a cow, and a plough horse\r\nwere the same price, 4s.; a sheep with fine wool 10d., with coarse\r\nwool 6d.; a sow 12d., a boar 12d.\r\n\r\nSometimes prices were kept down by imports; 1258 was a bad and dear\r\nyear, 'most part of the corn rotted on the ground,' and was not all\r\ngot in till after November 1, so excessive was the wet and rain. And\r\nupon the dearth a sore death and mortality followed for want of\r\nnecessary food to sustain the pining bodies of the poor people, who\r\ndied so thick that there were great pits made in churchyards to lay\r\nthe dead bodies in. And corn had been dearer if great store had not\r\ncome out of Almaine, but there came fifty great ships with wheat and\r\nbarley, meal and bread out of Dutchland, which greatly relieved the\r\npoor.[60]\r\n\r\nWere the manors as isolated as some writers have asserted? Generally\r\nspeaking, we may say the means of communication were bad and many an\r\nestate cut off almost completely from the outside world, yet the\r\nmanors must often have been connected by waterways, and sometimes by\r\ngood roads, with other manors and with the towns. Rivers in the Middle\r\nAges were far more used as means of communication than to-day, and\r\nmany streams now silted up and shallow were navigable according to\r\nDomesday. Water carriage was, as always, much cheaper than land\r\ncarriage, and corn could be carried from Henley to London for 2d. or\r\n3d. a quarter. The roads left by the Romans, owing to the excellence\r\nof their construction, remained in use during the Middle Ages, and\r\nmust have been a great advantage to those living near them; but the\r\nother roads can have been little better than mud tracks, except in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the few large towns. The keeping of the roads in\r\nrepair, one part of the _trinoda necessitas_ was imposed on all lands;\r\nbut the results often seem to have been very indifferent, and they\r\nappear largely to have depended on chance, or the goodwill or devotion\r\nof neighbouring landowners.[61] Perhaps they would, except in the case\r\nof the Roman roads, have been impassable but for the fact that the\r\ngreat lords and abbots were constantly visiting their scattered\r\nestates, and therefore were interested in keeping such roads in order.\r\nBut in those days people were contented with very little, and though\r\nEdward I enforced the general improvement of roads in 1285, in the\r\nfourteenth century they were decaying. Parliament adjourned thrice\r\nbetween 1331 and 1380 because the state of the roads kept many of the\r\nmembers away. In 1353 the high road running from Temple Bar, then the\r\nwestern limit of London, to Westminster was 'so full of holes and\r\nbogs' that the traffic was dangerous for men and carriages; and a\r\nlittle later all the roads near London were so bad, that carriers 'are\r\noftentimes In peril of losing what they bring.' What must remote\r\ncountry roads have been like when these important highways were in\r\nthis state? If members of Parliament, rich men riding good horses,\r\ncould not get to London, how did the clumsy wagons and carts of the\r\nday fare? The Church might well pity the traveller, and class him with\r\nthe sick 'and the captive among the unfortunates whom she recommended\r\nto the daily prayers of pious souls.'[62] Rivers were mainly crossed\r\nby ford or ferry, though there were some excellent bridges, a few of\r\nwhich still remain, maintained by the _trinoda necessitas_, by gilds,\r\nby 'indulgences' promised to benefactors, and by toll, the right to\r\nlevy which, called pontage, was often spent otherwise than on the\r\nrepair of the bridge.\r\n\r\nA few of the old open fields still exist, and the best surviving example\r\nof an open-field parish is that of Laxton in Nottinghamshire.[63]\r\nNearly half the area of the parish remains in the form of two great\r\narable fields, and two smaller ones which are treated as two parts of\r\nthe third field. The different holdings, freehold and leasehold,\r\nconsist in part of strips of land scattered all over these fields. The\r\nthree-course system is rigidly adhered to, first year wheat, second\r\nyear spring corn, third year fallow.\r\n\r\nIn a corner of the parish is Laxton Heath, a common covered with\r\ncoarse grass where the sheep are grazed according to a 'stint'\r\nrecently determined upon, for when it was unstinted the common was\r\noverstocked. The commonable meadows which the parish once had were\r\nenclosed at a date beyond anyone's recollection, though the\r\nneighbouring parish of Eakring still has some. There are other\r\nenclosures in the remote parts of the parish which apparently\r\nrepresent the old woodland. The inconvenience of the common-field\r\nsystem was extreme. South Luffenham in Rutland, not enclosed till\r\n1879, consisted of 1,074 acres divided among twenty-two owners into\r\n1,238 pieces. In some places furrows served to divide the lands\r\ninstead of turf balks, which were of course always being altered.\r\nAnother difficulty arose from there being no check to high winds,\r\nwhich would sometimes sweep the whole of the crops belonging to\r\ndifferent farmers in an inextricable heap against the nearest\r\nobstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Vinogradoff, _Growth of the Manor_, p. 18; Medley, _Constitutional\r\nHistory_, p. 15.\r\n\r\n[2] Vinogradoff, _Villeinage in England_, p. 257.\r\n\r\n[3] Maitland, _Domesday Book and Beyond_, pp. 341 et seq.\r\n\r\n[4] Stubbs, _Constitutional History_, §36.\r\n\r\n[5] Vinogradoff, _English Society in the Eleventh Century_, p. 282,\r\nsays, 'As a rule it was not subject to redivision.'\r\n\r\n[6] Cunningham, _Growth of English Industry and Commerce_, i. 42.\r\n\r\n[7] Maitland, _op. cit._ p. 368.\r\n\r\n[8] _Anonymous Treatise on Husbandry_, Royal Historical Society, pp.\r\nxli. and 68.

However, about\r\na hundred years ago, when oxen were in common use, we find teams of 8,\r\nas in Shropshire, for a single-furrow plough, 'so as to work them\r\neasily.' Six hours a day was the usual day's work, and when more was\r\nrequired one team was worked in the morning, another in the\r\nafternoon.--_Victoria County History: Shropshire, Agriculture_.

According to\r\nProfessor Thorold Rogers[64] there were two principal tenants, each\r\nholding the fourth part of a military fee. The prior of Holy Trinity,\r\nWallingford, held a messuage, a mill, and 6 acres of land in free\r\nalms; i.e. under no obligation or liability other than offering\r\nprayers on behalf of the donor. A free tenant had a messuage and 3-3/4\r\nacres, the rent of which was 3s. a year. He also had another messuage\r\nand nine acres, for which he paid the annual rent of 1 lb. of pepper,\r\nworth about 1s. 3d. The rector of the parish had part of a furrow,\r\ni.e. one of the divisions of the common arable field, and paid 2d. a\r\nyear for it. Another tenant held a cottage in the demesne under the\r\nobligation of keeping two lamps lighted in the church. Another person\r\nwas tenant-at-will of the parish mill, at a rent of 40s. a year. The\r\nrest of the tenants were villeins or cottagers, thirteen of the former\r\nand eight of the latter. Each of the villeins had a messuage and half\r\na virgate, 12 to 15 acres of arable land at least, for which his rent\r\nwas chiefly corn and labour, though there were two money payments, a\r\nhalfpenny on November 12 and a penny whenever he brewed. He had to pay\r\na quarter of seed wheat at Michaelmas, a peck of wheat, 4 bushels of\r\noats, and 3 hens on November 12, and at Christmas a cock, two hens,\r\nand two pennyworth of bread. His labour services were to plough, sow,\r\nand till half an acre of the lord's land, and give his work as\r\ndirected by the bailiff except on Sundays and feast days. In harvest\r\ntime he was to reap three days with one man at his own cost.\r\n\r\nSome of these tenants held, besides their half virgates, other plots\r\nof land for which each had to make hay for one day for the lord, with\r\na comrade, and received a halfpenny; also to mow, with another, three\r\ndays in harvest time, at their own charges, and another three days\r\nwhen the lord fed them. After harvest six pennyworth of beer was\r\ndivided among them, each received a loaf of bread, and every evening\r\nwhen work was over each reaper might carry away the largest sheaf of\r\ncorn he could lift on his sickle.\r\n\r\nThe cottagers paid from 1s. 2d. to 2s. a year for their holdings, and\r\nwere obliged to work a day or two in the hay-making, receiving\r\ntherefor a halfpenny. They also had to do from one to four days'\r\nharvest work, during which they were fed at the lord's table. For the\r\nrest of the year they were free labourers, tending cattle or sheep on\r\nthe common for wages or working at the various crafts usual in the\r\nvillage. This manor was a small one, and contained in all twenty-four\r\nhouseholds, numbering from sixty to seventy inhabitants.[65]\r\n\r\nOn most manors, as in Forncett,[66] which contained about 2,700 acres,\r\nfrom the preponderance of arable, the chief source of income to the\r\nlord was from the grain crops; other sources may be seen from the\r\nfollowing table of the lord's receipts and expenses in 1272-3:\r\n\r\n  RECEIPTS.\r\n                              £    s.    d.\r\n  Fixed rents                18    3    7-3/4\r\n  Farm of market              0    2    6\r\n  Chevage[67]                 0    8    6\r\n  Foldage                     0    3    9-1/2\r\n  Sale of works               5   13    2-3/4\r\n  Herbage                     1    0    4\r\n  Hay                         2   12   11\r\n  Turf, &c.                   1   13    6-1/2\r\n  Underwood                   5   10    2\r\n  Grain                      61   12    3-1/4\r\n  Cider                       1    1   11-1/4\r\n  Stock                       5    3    0\r\n  Dairy                       4    3    0-3/4\r\n  Pleas                      14    0    0\r\n  Tallage                    16   13    4\r\n                           ------------------\r\n                           £128    2    2-3/4\r\n\r\n EXPENSES.\r\n                              £    s.    d.\r\n\r\n  Rents paid and allowed      0    3    2-1/2\r\n  Ploughs and carts           2   17    4\r\n  Buildings and walls         4    5   10-1/2\r\n  Small necessaries           0    7   10-3/4\r\n  Dairy                       0    4    3-1/4\r\n  Threshing                   1   15    5-1/2\r\n  Meadow and autumn expenses  0    1    4\r\n  Stock                       0   16    7\r\n  Bailiff                     1   19    0\r\n  Steward                     1    6    9-1/2\r\n  Grain                       8    2    4-1/2\r\n  Expenses of acct.           1    0    8-1/2\r\n                            ------------------\r\n                            £23    0    9-3/4\r\n\r\nThe manor was almost entirely self-sufficing; of necessity, for towns\r\nwere few and distant, and the roads to them bad. Each would have its\r\nsmith, millwright, thatcher, &c., paid generally in kind for their\r\nservices. There was little trade with the outside world, except for\r\nsalt--an invaluable article when meat had to be salted down every\r\nautumn for winter use, since there were no roots to keep the cattle\r\non--and iron for some of the implements. Nearly everything was made in\r\nthe village.\r\n\r\nThe mediaeval system of tillage was compulsory; even the freeholders\r\ncould not manage their plots as they wished, because all the soil of\r\nthe township formed one whole and was managed by the entire village.\r\nEven the lord[68] had to conform to the customs of the community. Any\r\nother system than this, which must have been galling to the more\r\nenterprising, was impossible, for as the various holdings lay in\r\nunfenced strips all over the great common fields, individual\r\ninitiative was out of the question. As may be imagined, the great\r\nnumber of strips all mixed together often led to great confusion,\r\nsometimes 2 or 3 acres could not be found at all, and disputes owing\r\nto careless measurement were frequent.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the services by which the villeins paid rent\r\nfor their holdings to the lord very early began to be commuted for\r\nmoney; it was much more convenient to both parties; and with this\r\nchange from a 'natural economy' to a 'money economy' the destruction\r\nof the manorial system commenced, though it was to take centuries to\r\neffect it.\r\n\r\nThe first money payments apparently date from as early as 900,[69]\r\nbut must then have been very few, and services were the rule in the\r\nthirteenth and earlier centuries, though at the beginning of the\r\ntwelfth we find a great number of rent-paying tenants.[70] In the\r\nfourteenth century money began to be more generally available, and the\r\nprocess of commutation grew steadily; a process greatly accelerated by\r\nthe destruction of large numbers of tenants who paid rent in services\r\nby the Black Death of 1348-9, which forced lords of manors to let\r\ntheir lands for money or work them themselves with hired labour.\r\nBefore that visitation, however, it appears that commutation of labour\r\nservices for fixed annual payments had made very little progress.[71]\r\n\r\nWhen these services were commuted for money in the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries they were put at 1d. a day in winter, and 2d. a\r\nday in summer, and rather more in harvest[72]; and we may put the\r\nordinary agricultural labourers' wages from 1250-1350 all the year\r\nround at 2d. a day, and from 1350-1400 at 3d., but few were paid in\r\nthis way. Many were paid by the year, with allowances of food besides\r\nand sometimes clothes, and many were in harvest at all events paid by\r\nthe piece. At Crondal in Hampshire in 1248 a carter by the year\r\nreceived 4s., a herdsman 2s. 3d., a day a or dairymaid, 2s.[73] The\r\nchange to money payments was beneficial to both parties; it stopped\r\nmany of the dishonest practices of the lord's bailiff, apart from the\r\nfact that farming by officials was an expensive method. It meant, too,\r\nthat religious festivals and bad weather would no longer diminish the\r\nlord's profits; on the other hand, the tenant could devote himself\r\nentirely to his holding free from annoying labour services.[74]\r\n\r\nThe state of agriculture at the time of Domesday was apparently very\r\nlow, judging by the small returns of manors,[75] but by the time of\r\nEdward I it had made considerable progress. During the reign of Henry\r\nIII England had grown in opulence, and continued to do so under his\r\ngreat son, who found time from his manifold tasks to encourage\r\nagriculture and horticulture. Fruit and forest trees, shrubs and\r\nflowers, were introduced from the continent, and we are told that the\r\nhop flourished in the royal gardens.[76] At his death England was\r\nprosperous, the people progressing in comfort, the population\r\nadvancing, the agricultural labourers were increasing in numbers, the\r\nvalue of the land had risen and was rising. Then came a reaction from\r\nwhich England did not recover for two centuries, and Harrison, who\r\nwrote his description of England at the end of the sixteenth century,\r\nsays that many of the improvements began to be neglected in process of\r\ntime, so that from Henry IV till the latter end of Henry VII there was\r\nlittle or no use for them in England, 'but they remained unknown.'\r\n\r\nThe Hundred Rolls of Edward I, which embody the results of the labours\r\nof a commission appointed by that monarch to inquire into encroachments\r\non royal lands and royal jurisdiction, show clearly that there had\r\nbeen since the Domesday Survey a very great growth in the rural\r\npopulation, a sure sign that agriculture was flourishing; and on some\r\nestates the number of free tenants had increased largely, but the\r\nburdens of the villeins were not less onerous than they had been.\r\n\r\nIt was in the thirteenth century that the practice of keeping strict\r\nand minute accounts became general, and the accounts of the bailiff of\r\nthose days would be a revelation to the bailiff of these.\r\n\r\nAt the same time we must not forget that the earliest improvements in\r\nEnglish agriculture were largely due to the monks, who from their\r\nconstant journeys abroad were able to bring back new plants and seeds;\r\nwhile it is well known that many of the religious houses, the\r\nCistercians especially, who always settled in the remote country, were\r\nmost energetic farmers, their energy being materially assisted by\r\ntheir wealth. It is said that the great Becket when he visited a\r\nmonastery did not disdain to labour in the field.\r\n\r\nAmong other benefits that the landed interest gained at this time was\r\nthe more easy transference of land provided, _inter alia_, by the\r\nstatute of _Quia Emptores_, which led to many tenants selling their\r\nlands, provided the rights of the lord were preserved, and to a great\r\nincrease consequently of free tenants, many of whom had quite small\r\nholdings.[77] The amalgamation of holdings by the more industrious and\r\nskilful has, as we should expect, been a well-marked tendency all\r\nthrough the history of English agriculture, and began early. For\r\ninstance, according to the records of S. Paul's Cathedral, John\r\nDurant, whose ancestor in 1222 held only one virgate in 'Cadendon',\r\nhad in 1279 eight or ten at least. At 'Belchamp', Martin de Suthmere,\r\none of the free tenants, held 245 acres by himself and his tenants,\r\ntwenty-two in number, who rendered service to him; one of them being\r\nde Vere, Earl of Oxford, who held 17 acres under Martin. To such a\r\nposition had the abler of the small holders of a century or so before\r\nalready pushed their way, in spite of the heavy hand of feudalism,\r\nwhich did much to hinder individual initiative. At this period and\r\nuntil Tudor times England, as regards the cultivated land, was\r\nessentially a corn-growing country; the greater part of the lord's\r\ndemesne was arable, and the tillage fields of the villeins largely\r\nexceeded their meadows. For instance, in 1285 the cultivated lands at\r\nHawsted in Suffolk were nearly all under the plough; in seven holdings\r\nthere were 968 acres of arable and only 40 of meadow, a proportion of\r\n24 to 1. No doubt there was plenty of common pasture, but we cannot\r\ncall this cultivated land. The seven holdings were as follows:[78]\r\n\r\n                                                   Acres.\r\n\r\n                                         Arable.    Meadow.

The wheat was cut high, the\r\nstraw often apparently left standing 18 inches or 2 feet high; weeds\r\nof all kinds abounded, for the land was badly cleaned; and often only\r\nthe upper part of the high ridges, into which the land was thrown for\r\npurposes of drainage, was cultivated, the lower parts being left to\r\nnatural grass.[79]\r\n\r\nThe greatest authority for the farming of the thirteenth century is\r\nWalter of Henley, who wrote, about the middle of it, a work which held\r\nthe field as an agricultural textbook until Fitzherbert wrote in the\r\nsixteenth century, and much of his advice is valuable to-day. There\r\nwas from his time until the days of William Marshall, who wrote five\r\ncenturies afterwards, a controversy as to the respective merits of\r\nhorses and oxen as draught animals, and it is a curious fact that the\r\nlater writer agreed with the earlier as to the superiority of oxen. 'A\r\nplough of oxen', says Walter, 'will go as far in the year as a plough\r\nof horses, because the malice of the ploughman will not allow the\r\nplough of horses to go beyond their pace, no more than the plough of\r\noxen. Further, in very hard ground where the plough of horses will\r\nstop, the plough of oxen will pass. And the horse costs more than the\r\nox, for he is obliged to have the sixth part of a bushel of oats every\r\nnight, worth a halfpenny at least, and twelve pennyworth of grass in\r\nthe summer. Besides, each week he costs more or less a penny a week in\r\nshoeing, if he must be shod on all four feet;' which was not the\r\nuniversal custom.\r\n\r\n'But the ox has only to have 3-1/2 sheaves of oats per week (ten\r\nsheaves yielding a bushel of oats), worth a penny, and the same amount\r\nof grass as the horse.[80] And when the horse is old and worn out\r\nthere is nothing but his skin, but when the ox is old with ten\r\npennyworth of grass he shall be fit for the larder.'[81]\r\n\r\nThe labourer of the Middle Ages could not complain of lack of\r\nholidays; Walter of Henley tells us that, besides Sundays, eight weeks\r\nwere lost in the year from holidays and other hindrances.[82]\r\n\r\nHe advises the sowing of spring seed on clay or on stony land early,\r\nbecause if it is dry in March the ground will harden too much and the\r\nstony ground become dry and open; therefore fore sow early that corn\r\nmay be nourished by winter moisture. Chalky and sandy ground need not\r\nbe sown early. At sowing, moreover, do not plough large furrows, but\r\nlittle and well laid together, that the seed may fall evenly. Let your\r\nland be cleaned and weeded after S. John's Day, June 24, for before\r\nthat is not a good time; and if thistles are cut before S. John's Day\r\n'for every one will come two or three.' Do not sell your straw; if you\r\ntake away the least you lose much; words which many a landlord to-day\r\ndoubtless wishes were fixed in the minds of his tenants.\r\n\r\nManure should be mixed with earth, for it lasts only two or three\r\nyears by itself, but with earth it will last twice as long; for when\r\nthe manure and the earth are harrowed together the earth shall keep\r\nthe manure so that it cannot waste by descending in the soil, which it\r\nis apt to do.\r\n\r\n'Feed your working oxen before some one, and with chaff. Why? I will\r\ntell you. Because it often happens that the oxherd steals the\r\nprovender.'\r\n\r\nThe oxen were also to be bathed, and curried when dry with a wisp of\r\nstraw, which would cause them to lick themselves.\r\n\r\n'Change your seed every year at Michaelmas; for seed grown on other\r\nground will bring more profit than that which is grown on your own.'\r\n\r\nApparently the only drainage then practised was that of furrow and\r\nopen ditch; and we find him saying that to free your lands from too\r\nmuch water, let the marshy ground be well ridged, and the water made\r\nto run, and so the ground may be freed from water.\r\n\r\nHere is his estimate of the cost of wheat growing[83]:\r\n\r\n     'You know surely that an acre sown with wheat takes three\r\n     ploughings, except lands which are sown yearly; and that each\r\n     ploughing is worth 6d. and the harrowing 1d., and on the acre\r\n     it is necessary to sow at least two bushels. Now two bushels at\r\n     Michaelmas are worth at least 12d., and weeding 1/2d., and\r\n     reaping 5d., and carrying in August 1d., and the straw will pay\r\n     for the threshing.'[83]\r\n\r\nThe return was wretched: 'at three times your sowing you ought to have\r\n6 bushels, worth 3s.' The total cost is thus 3s. 1-1/2d.; and without\r\ndebiting anything for rent and manure, the loss would be 1-1/2d. an\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nThe anonymous _Treatise on Husbandry_ of about the same date says,\r\nhowever, that 'wheat ought to yield to the fifth grain, oats to the\r\nfourth, barley to the eighth, beans and peas to the sixth.'[84] In the\r\nyears 1243-8 the average yield of wheat at Combe, Oxfordshire, was 5\r\nbushels per acre, of barley a little over 5, oats 7. In the Manor of\r\nForncett, in various years from 1290 to 1306, wheat yielded about 10\r\nbushels, oats from 12 to 16, barley 16, and peas from 4 to 12 bushels\r\nper acre.[85]\r\n\r\nAs for the dairy, 2 cows, says Walter, should yield a wey, (2 cwt) of\r\ncheese annually, and half a gallon of butter a week, 'if sorted out\r\nand fed in pasture of salt marsh;' but 'in pasture of wood or in\r\nmeadows after mowing, or in stubble, it should take 3 cows for the\r\nsame.' Twenty ewes, which it was then the custom to milk, fed in\r\npasture of salt marsh, ought to yield the same as the 2 cows. A gallon\r\nof butter was worth 6d., and weighed 7 lb. And the anonymous treatise\r\nsays each cow ought to yield from the day after Michaelmas until the\r\nfirst kalends of May, twenty-eight weeks, 10d. more or less; and from\r\nthe first kalends of May till Michaelmas, twenty-four weeks, the milk\r\nof a cow should be worth 3s. 6d.; and she should give also 6 stones\r\n(14 lb. per stone) of cheese, and 'as much butter as shall make as\r\nmuch cheese.'[86] It was a common practice all through the Middle\r\nAges, and survives in localities to-day, to let out the cows by the\r\nyear, at from 3s. to 6s. 8d. a head, often to the daya or dairymaid,\r\nthe owner supplying the food, and the lessee agreeing to restore them\r\nin equal number and condition at the end of the term.[87] The\r\nanonymous treatise tells us that 'if you wish to farm out your stock\r\nyou can take 4s. 6d. clear for each cow and the tithe, and for a sheep\r\n6d. and the tithe, and a sow should bring you 6s. 6d. a year and\r\nacquit the tithe, and each hen 9d. and the tithe; and Walter says,\r\n'When I was bailiff the dairymaids had the geese and hens to farm, the\r\ngeese at 12d. and the hens at 3d.'\r\n\r\nAmong other information conveyed by these two treatises we learn that\r\nthe poor servants or labourers were accustomed to be fed on the\r\ndiseased sheep, salted and dried; but Walter adds, 'I do not wish you\r\nto do this.' Nor can we point the finger of scorn at this: for in the\r\ndisastrous season of 1879 numbers of rotten sheep were sold to the\r\nbutcher and consumed by the unsuspecting public without even being\r\nsalted and dried.\r\n\r\nHe further tells us that 'you can well have 3 acres weeded for 1d.,\r\nand an acre of meadow mown for 4d., and an acre of waste meadow for\r\n3-1/2d. And know that 5 men can well reap and bind 2 acres a day of\r\neach kind of corn, and where each takes 2d. a day then you must give\r\n5d. an acre.'[88] 'One ought to thresh a quarter of wheat or rye for\r\n2d. and a quarter of oats for 1d. A sow ought to farrow twice a year,\r\nhaving each time at least 7 pigs; and each goose 5 goslings a year and\r\neach hen 115 eggs and 7 chicks, 3 of which ought to be made capons;\r\nand for 5 geese you must have one gander, and for 5 hens one cock.'\r\nThe laying qualities of the hen, in spite of the talk of the 200-egg\r\nbird, were evidently as good then as to-day. In those days of\r\nself-supporting farms it was the custom to put together the farm\r\nimplements at home, and the farmer is advised that it will be well if\r\nhe can have carters and ploughmen who should know how to work all\r\ntheir own wood, though it should be necessary to pay them more.[89]\r\nThe village smith, however, seems, as we should expect, to have done\r\nmost of the iron work that was needed.[90]\r\n\r\nThese extracts have given the reader some insight into\r\nthirteenth-century prices, prices which in the case of grain altered\r\nvery little for nearly 300 years: for instance, the average price of\r\nwheat from 1259 to 1400 was 5s. 10-3/4d. a quarter, and from 1401 to\r\n1540 5s. 11-3/4d.; of barley, 4s. 3-3/4d. from 1259 to 1400, 3s.\r\n8-3/4d. from 1401 to 1540; of oats, 2s. 5-3/4d. and 2s. 2-1/4d. in the\r\nsame two periods respectively; of rye, 4s. 5d. and 4s. 7-3/4d.; and of\r\nbeans, 4s. 3-1/2d. and 3s. 9-1/4d.[91] Wheat fluctuated considerably,\r\nbeing as we have seen 2s. a quarter at Hawsted in 1243 and in 1290\r\n14s. 10d., a most exceptional price. Oxen, which were chiefly valued\r\nas working animals, were about 13s. apiece[92]; cows, 9s. 5d. Farm\r\nhorses were of two varieties: the 'affer' or 'stott', a rough small\r\nanimal, generally worth about 13s. 5d., and the cart-horse, probably\r\nthe ancestor of our shire horses, whose average price was 19s. 4d. A\r\ngood saddle-horse fetched as much as £5. Sheep were from 1s. 2d. to\r\n1s. 5d. each. In Hampshire in 1248 shoeing ten farm horses for the\r\nplough for a year cost 5s.; making a gate cost 12d. As Walter of\r\nHenley said, it cost a penny a week to shoe a horse on all four feet;\r\nthese horses must have been very roughly shod.[93] It is evident, from\r\nwhat Walter of Henley says, that horses were not always shod on all\r\nfour feet, and their shoes were generally very light. The roads were\r\nmere tracks without any metalling, so that there was little necessity\r\nfor heavy shoes; and as Professor Thorold Rogers suggests, it is quite\r\npossible that the hoofs of our horses have become weaker by reason of\r\nthe continual paring and protection which modern shoeing involves.[94]\r\nThey weighed usually less than half a pound, and cost about 4s. a\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nThe most striking fact about agricultural prices at this date is the\r\nlow price of land compared with that of its products. The annual rent\r\nof land was from 4d. to 6d.[95] an acre, and it was worth about ten\r\nyears' purchase. Consequently, a quarter of wheat was often worth more\r\nthan an acre of land, a good ox three times as much, a good cart-horse\r\nfour times, while a good war-horse was worth the fee-simple of a small\r\nfarm. A greater breadth of wheat was sown than of any other crop; but\r\nit seems that none was ever stored except in the castles and\r\nmonasteries, for in spite of successive abundant harvests a bad season\r\nwould send the price up at once. Barley was, as now, chiefly used for\r\nmaking beer, which was also made from oats and wheat, of course\r\nwithout hops, which were not used till the fifteenth century; and\r\nsometimes it was made of oats, barley, and wheat, a concoction worth\r\n3/4d. a gallon in 1283.[96] Cider was also drunk, and was sold at\r\nExminster in Devonshire in 1286 at 1/2d. a gallon, and apples fetched\r\n2d. a bushel. Thorold Rogers[97] says that wheat was the chief food of\r\nthe English labourer from the earliest times until perhaps the\r\nseventeenth century, when the enormous prices were prohibitive; but\r\nthis statement must be taken with reserve, as must that of Mr.\r\nProthero[98] that rye was the bread-stuff of the peasantry. Where the\r\nlabourer's food is mentioned as part of his wages, wheat, barley, and\r\nrye all occur, wheat and rye being often mixed together as 'mixtil';\r\nand it is most probable that in one district wheat, in another one of\r\nthe other cereals, formed his chief bread-stuff, according to the crop\r\nbest adapted to the soil of the locality.\r\n\r\nWalter of Henley mentions wheat as if it was the chief crop, for he\r\nselects it as best illustrating the cost of corn-growing[99]; and from\r\nthe enormous number of entries enumerated by Thorold Rogers in his\r\nmediaeval statistics it was apparently more grown than other cereals.\r\nThe chief meat of the lower classes then, as to-day, was bacon from\r\nthe innumerable herds of swine who roamed in the woods and wastes, but\r\nin bad years, when food was scarce, the poor ate nuts, acorns, fern\r\nroots, bark, and vetches.[100]\r\n\r\nAs the cattle of the Middle Ages were like the mountain cattle of\r\nto-day, so were the sheep like many of the sheep to be seen in the\r\nWelsh mountains; yet, unlike the cattle, an attempt seems to have been\r\nmade, judging by the high price of rams, to improve the breed; but\r\nthey were probably poor animals worth from 1s. to 1s. 6d. each, with a\r\nsmall fleece weighing about a pound and a half, worth 3d. a lb. or a\r\nlittle more.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[64] _Six Centuries of Work and Wages_, p. 39.

The weak government of Edward\r\nII, the long French War commenced by Edward III and lasting over a\r\nhundred years, and the Wars of the Roses, all combined to impoverish\r\nthe country. England, too, was repeatedly afflicted during the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries by pestilences, sometimes caused by\r\nfamines, sometimes coming with no apparent cause; all probably\r\naggravated, if not caused, by the insanitary habits of the people. The\r\nmention of plagues, indeed, at this time is so frequent that we may\r\ncall them chronic.\r\n\r\nAt this period corn and wool were the two main products of the farmer;\r\ncorn to feed his household and labourers, and wool to put money in his\r\npocket, a somewhat rare thing.\r\n\r\nEnglish wool, which came to be called 'the flower and strength and\r\nrevenue and blood of England', was famous in very early times, and was\r\nexported long before the Conquest. In Edgar's reign the price was\r\nfixed by law, to prevent it getting into the hands of the foreigner\r\ntoo cheaply; a wey, or weigh, was to be sold for 120d.[101] Patriotic\r\nEnglishmen asserted it was the best in the world, and Henry II, Edward\r\nIII, and Edward IV are said to have improved the Spanish breed by\r\npresents of English sheep. Spanish wool, however, was considered the\r\nbest from the earliest times until the Peninsular War, when the Saxon\r\nand Silesian wools deposed it from its pride of place. Smith, in his\r\n_Memoirs of Wool_,[102] is of the opinion that England 'borrowed some\r\nparts of its breed from thence, as it certainly did the whole from one\r\nplace or another.' Spanish wool, too, was imported into England at an\r\nearly date, the manufacture of it being carried on at Andover in\r\n1262.[103] Yet until the fourteenth century it was not produced in\r\nsufficient quantities to compete seriously with English wool in the\r\nmarkets of the Continent; and it appears to have been the long wools,\r\nsuch as those of the modern Leicester and Lincoln, from which England\r\nchiefly derived its fame as a wool-producing country.\r\n\r\nOur early exports went to Flanders, where weaving had been introduced\r\na century before the Conquest, and, in spite of the growth of the\r\nweaving industry in England, to that country the bulk of it continued\r\nto go, all through the Middle Ages, though in the thirteenth century a\r\ndetermined effort was made to divert a larger share of English wool to\r\nItaly.[104] During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the export\r\nof wool was frequently forbidden,[105] sometimes for political\r\nobjects, but also to gain the manufacture of cloth for England by\r\nkeeping our wool from the foreigner; but these measures did not stop\r\nthe export, they only hampered it and encouraged much smuggling. It\r\ncommanded what seems to us an astonishing price, for 3d. a lb. in the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries is probably equal to nearly 4s. in\r\nour money. Its value, and the ease with which it could be packed and\r\ncarried, made it an object of great importance to the farmer. In\r\n1337[106] we have a schedule of the price of wool in the various\r\ncounties of England, for in that year 30,000 sacks of the best wool\r\nwas ordered to be bought in various districts by merchants for Edward\r\nIII, to provide the sinews of war against France. The price for the\r\nbest wool was to be fixed by the king, his council, and the merchants;\r\nthe 'gross' wool being bought by agreement between buyer and seller.\r\nOf the former the highest price fixed was for the wool of Hereford,\r\nthen and for long afterwards famous for its excellent quality, 12\r\nmarks the sack of 364 lb.; and the lowest for that of the northern\r\ncounties, 5 marks the sack.\r\n\r\nSomewhat more than a century afterwards we have another similar list\r\nof wool prices, when in 1454 the Commons petitioned the king that 'as\r\nthe wools growing within this realm have hitherto been the great\r\ncommodity, enriching, and welfare of this land, and how of late the\r\nprice is greatly decayed so that the Commons were not able to pay\r\ntheir rents to their lords', the king would fix certain prices under\r\nwhich wools should not be bought. The highest price fixed was for the\r\nwool of 'Hereford, in Leominster', £13 a sack; the lowest for that of\r\nSuffolk, £2 12s.[107]; the average being about £4 10s.\r\n\r\nThe manorial accounts of the Knights' Hospitallers, who then held land\r\nall over England, afford valuable information as to agriculture in\r\n1338.[108] From these we gather that the rent of arable land varied\r\nfrom 2d. to 2s. an acre; but the latter sum was very exceptional, and\r\nthere are only two instances of it given, in Lincolnshire and Kent.\r\nMost of the tillage rented for less than 1s. an acre, more than half\r\nbeing at 6d. or under, and the average about 6d. On the other hand,\r\nmeadow land is seldom of less value than 2s. an acre, and in\r\nWarwickshire, Oxfordshire, and Norfolk rose to 3s. This is one of the\r\nnumerous proofs of the great value of meadow land at a time when hay\r\nwas almost the sole winter food of stock; in some places it was eight\r\nor ten times as valuable as the arable.[109] The pasture on the\r\nHospitallers' estates was divided into several and common pasture, the\r\nformer often reaching 1s. an acre and sometimes 2s., the latter rarely\r\nexceeding 4d. The most usual way, however, of stating the value of\r\npasture was by reckoning the annual cost of feeding stock per head,\r\ncows being valued at 2s., oxen at 1s., a horse at a little less than\r\nan ox, a sheep at 1d. The reign of Edward III was a great era for\r\nwool-growers, and the Hospitallers at Hampton in Middlesex had a flock\r\nof 2,000 sheep whose annual produce was six sacks of wool of 364 lb.\r\neach, worth £4 a sack, which would make the fleeces weigh a little\r\nmore than 1 lb. each. The profit of cows on one of their manors was\r\nreckoned at 2s. per head, on another at 3s.; and the profit of 100\r\nsheep at 20s.[110] The wages paid to the labourers for day work were\r\n2d. a day, and we must remember that when he was paid by the day his\r\nwages were rightly higher than when regularly employed, for day labour\r\nwas irregular and casual. The tenants about the same date obtained the\r\nfollowing prices[111] for some of their stock:--\r\n\r\n                                            £   s.  d.\r\n\r\n  A good ox, alive, fatted on corn          1   4   0\r\n       \"       \"        \"  not on corn         16   0\r\n  A fatted cow                                 12   0\r\n  A two-year-old hog                            3   4\r\n  A sheep and its fleece                        1   8\r\n  A fatted sheep, shorn                         1   2\r\n       \"   goose                                0   3\r\n  Hens, each[112]                               0   2\r\n  20 eggs                                       0   1\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the fourteenth century occurred the famous Black\r\nDeath, the worst infliction that has ever visited England. Its story\r\nis too well known for repetition, and it suffices to say that it was\r\nlike the bubonic plague in the East of to-day: it raged in 1348-9, and\r\nkilled from one-third to one-half of the people.[113] It is said to\r\nhave effected more important economic results than any other event in\r\nEnglish history. It is probable that the prices of labour were rising\r\nbefore this terrible calamity; the dreadful famine of 1315-6,[114]\r\nfollowed by pestilence, when wheat went up to 26s. a quarter, and\r\naccording to the contemporary chroniclers, in some cases much higher,\r\ndestroyed a large number of the population, and other plagues had done\r\ntheir share to make labour scarce, but after the Black Death the\r\nadvance was strongly marked. It also accelerated the break-up of the\r\nmanorial system. A large number of the free labourers were swept away,\r\nand their labour lost to the lord of the manor; the services of the\r\nvilleins were largely diminished from the same cause; many of the\r\ntenants, both free and unfree, were dead, and the land thrown on the\r\nlord's hands. Flocks and herds were wandering about over the country\r\nbecause there was no one to tend them. In short, most manors were in a\r\nstate of anarchy, and their lords on the verge of ruin. It is not to\r\nbe wondered at, therefore, that they immediately adopted strong\r\nmeasures to save themselves and their property and, no doubt they\r\nthought, the whole country. Englishmen had by this time learnt to turn\r\nto Parliament to remedy their ills, but as the plague was still raging\r\na proclamation was issued of which the preamble states that wages had\r\nalready gone up greatly. 'Many, seeing the necessity of masters and\r\ngreat scarcity of servants, will not serve unless they get excessive\r\nwages', and it is, therefore, hard to till the land. Every one under\r\nthe age of 60, it was ordered, free or villein, who can work, and has\r\nno other means of livelihood, is not to refuse to work for any one who\r\noffers the accustomed wages; no labourer is to receive more wages than\r\nhe did before the plague, and none are to give more wages under severe\r\npenalties. But besides regulating wages, the proclamation also insists\r\non reasonable prices for food and the necessaries of life: it was a\r\nfair attempt not only to protect the landlords but the labourers also,\r\nby keeping both wages and prices at their former rate, so that its\r\nobject was not tyrannous as has been stated.[115] It was at once\r\ndisregarded, a fate which met many of the proclamations and statutes\r\nof the Middle Ages, which often seem to have been regarded as mere\r\npious aspirations.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Statute of 1351, 25 Edw. III, Stat. 2, c. 1, states\r\nthat the servants had paid no regard to the ordinance regulating\r\nwages, 'but to their ease and singular covetise do withdraw themselves\r\nunless they have livery and wages to the double or treble of that they\r\nwere wont to take'. Accordingly, it was again laid down that they were\r\nto take liveries and wages as before the Black Death, and 'where wheat\r\nwas wont to be given they shall take for the bushel 10d. (6s. 8d. a\r\nquarter),[116] or wheat at the will of the giver. And that they be\r\nhired to serve by the whole year or by other usual terms, and not by\r\nthe day, and that none pay in the time of sarcling (weeding) or\r\nhay-making but a penny a day, and a mower of meadows for the acre 5d.,\r\nor by the day 5d., and reapers of corn in the first week of August\r\n2d., and the second 3d., without meat or drink.' And none were to take\r\nfor the threshing of a quarter of wheat or rye more than 2d., and for\r\nthe quarter of beans, peas, and oats more than 1d. These prices are\r\ncertainly difficult to understand. Hay-making has usually been paid\r\nfor at a rate above the ordinary, because of the longer hours; and\r\nhere we find the price fixed at half the usual wages, while mowing is\r\nfive times as much, and double the price paid for reaping, though they\r\nwere normally about the same price.[117]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to learn from the statute that there was a\r\nconsiderable migration of labourers at this date for the harvest, from\r\nStafford, Lancaster, Derby, Craven, the Marches of Wales and Scotland,\r\nand other places.\r\n\r\nSuch was the first attempt made to control the labourers' wages by the\r\nlegislature, and like other legislation of the kind it failed in its\r\nobject, though the attempt was honestly made; and if the rate of wages\r\nfixed was somewhat low, its inequity was far surpassed by the\r\nexorbitance of the labourers' demands.[118] It was an endeavour to set\r\naside economic laws, and its futility was rendered more certain by the\r\ndepreciation of the coinage in 1351, which led to an advance in\r\nprices, and compelled the labourers to persevere in their demands for\r\nhigher wages.[119]\r\n\r\nBoth wages and prices, except those of grain, continued to increase,\r\nand labour services were now largely commuted for money payments,[120]\r\nwith the result that the manorial system began to break up rapidly.\r\n\r\nOwing to the dearth of labourers for hire, and the loss of many of the\r\nservices of their villeins, the lords found it very hard to farm their\r\ndemesne lands. It should be remembered, too, that an additional\r\nhardship from which they suffered at this time was that the quit rents\r\npaid to them in lieu of services by tenants who had already become\r\nfree were, owing to the rise in prices, very much depreciated. Their\r\nchief remedy was to let their demesne lands. The condition of the\r\nManor of Forncett in Norfolk well illustrates the changes that were\r\nnow going on. There, in the period 1272-1307, there were many free\r\ntenants as well as villeins, and the holdings of the latter were\r\nsmall, usually only 5 acres. It is also to be noticed that in no year\r\nwere all the labour services actually performed, some were always sold\r\nfor money. Yet in the period named there was not much progress in the\r\ngeneral commutation of services for money payments, and the same was\r\nthe case in the manors, whose records between 1325 and 1350 Mr. Page\r\nexamined for his _End of Villeinage in England_.[121] The reaping and\r\nbinding of the entire grain crop of the demesne at Forncett was done\r\nby the tenants exclusively, without the aid of any hired labour.[122]\r\n\r\nHowever, in the period 1307-1376 the manor underwent a great change.\r\nThe economic position of the villeins, the administration of the\r\ndemesne, and the whole organization of the manor were revolutionized.\r\nMuch of the tenants' land had reverted to the lord, partly by the\r\ndeaths in the great pestilence, partly because tenants had left the\r\nmanor; they had run away and left their burdensome holdings in order\r\nto get high wages as free labourers. This of course led to a\r\ndiminution of labour rents, so the landlord let most of the demesne\r\nfor a term of years,[123] a process which went on all over England;\r\nand thus we have the origin of the modern tenant farmer. A fact of\r\nmuch importance in connexion with the Peasants' Revolt, soon to take\r\nplace, was that the average money rent of land per acre in Forncett in\r\n1378 was 10d., while the labour rents for land, where they were still\r\npaid by villeins who had not commuted or run away, were, owing to the\r\nrise in the value of labour, worth two or three times this. We cannot\r\nwonder that the poor villeins were profoundly discontented.\r\n\r\nOn this manor, as on others, some of the villeins, in spite of the\r\nmany disadvantages under which they lay, managed to accumulate some\r\nlittle wealth. In 1378 and in 1410 one bond tenant had two messuages\r\nand 78 acres of land; in 1441 another died seized of 5 messuages and\r\n52 acres; some had a number of servants in their households, but the\r\nmajority were very poor. There are several instances of bondmen\r\nfleeing from the manor; and the officers of the manor failed to catch\r\nthem. This was common in other manors, and the 'withdrawal' of\r\nvilleins played a considerable part in the disappearance of serfdom\r\nand the break-up of the system.[124] The following table shows the\r\ngradual disappearance of villeins in the Manor of Forncett:\r\n\r\n  In 1400 the servile families who had land numbered     16\r\n     1500        \"               \"             \"          8\r\n     1525        \"               \"             \"          5\r\n     1550        \"               \"             \"          3\r\n     1575        \"               \"             \"          0\r\n\r\nThere is no event of greater importance in the agrarian history of\r\nEngland, or which has led to more important consequences, than the\r\ndissolution of this community in the cultivation of the land, which\r\nhad been in use so long, and the establishment of the complete\r\nindependence and separation of one property from another.[125] As soon\r\nas the manorial system began to give way, and men to have a free hand,\r\nthe substitution of large for small holdings set in with fresh vigour,\r\nfor we have already seen that it had begun. It was one of the chief\r\ncauses of the stagnation of agriculture in the Middle Ages that it lay\r\nunder the heavy hand of feudalism, by which individualism was checked\r\nand hindered. Every one had his allotted position on the land, and it\r\nwas hard to get out of it, though some exceptional men did so; as a\r\nrule there was no chance of striking out a new line for oneself. The\r\nvillein was bound to the lord, and no lord would willingly surrender\r\nhis services. There could be little improvement in farming when the\r\ncustom of the manor and the collective ownership of the teams bound\r\nall to the same system of farming.[126] In fact, agriculture under\r\nfeudalism suffered from many of the evils of socialism.\r\n\r\nBut, though hard hit, the old system was to endure for many\r\ngenerations, and the modern triumvirate of landlord, tenant, and\r\nlabourer was not completely established in England until the era of\r\nthe first Reform Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[101] Cunningham, _Growth of English Industry and Commerce_, i. 130.

The wet\r\nseason was very disastrous to live stock; according to the accounts of\r\nthe manors of Christ Church, Canterbury, about this time (_Historical\r\nMSS. Commission, 5th Report_, 444) there died of the murrain on their\r\nestates 257 oxen, 511 cows, 4,585 sheep. Murrain was the name given to\r\nall diseases of stock in the Middle Ages, and is of constant\r\noccurrence in old records.\r\n\r\n[114] The cause of this as usual was incessant rain during the greater\r\npart of the summer; the chronicles of the time say that not only were\r\nthe crops very short but those that did grow were diseased and yielded\r\nno nourishment. The 'murrain' was so deadly to oxen and sheep that,\r\naccording to Walsingham, dogs and ravens eating them dropped down\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n[115] See Cunningham, _Industry and Commerce_, i. 335. Also in an age\r\nwhen the idea of Competitive price had not yet been evolved, and when\r\nregulation by authority was the custom, it was natural and right that\r\nthe Government in such a crisis should try to check the demands of\r\nboth labourers and producers, which went far beyond what employers or\r\nconsumers could pay.

The popular idea of a baron of the\r\nMiddle Ages is of a man who when he was not fighting was jousting or\r\nhunting. Such were, no doubt, his chief recreations; so fond was he of\r\nhunting, indeed, that his own broad lands were not enough, and he was\r\na frequent trespasser on those of others; the records of the time are\r\nfull of cases which show that poaching was quite a fashionable\r\namusement among the upper classes. But among the barons were many men\r\nwho, like their successors to-day, did their duty as landlords. Of one\r\nof the Lords of Berkeley in the fourteenth century, it was said he was\r\n'sometyme in husbandry at home, sometyme at sport in the field,\r\nsometyme in the campe, sometyme in the Court and Council of State,\r\nwith that promptness and celerity that his body might have bene\r\nbelieved to be ubiquitary'. Many of them were farmers on a very large\r\nscale, though they might not have so much time to devote to it as\r\nthose excellent landlords the monks.\r\n\r\nThomas Lord Berkeley, who held the Berkeley estates from 1326 to 1361,\r\nfarmed the demesnes of a quantity of manors, as was the custom, and\r\nkept thereon great flocks of sheep, ranging from 300 to 1,500 on each\r\nmanor.[127] The stock of the Bishop of Winchester, by an inquisition\r\ntaken at his death in 1367, amounted to 127 draught horses, 1,556 head\r\nof black cattle, and 12,104 sheep and lambs. Almost every manor had\r\none or two pigeon houses, and the number of pigeons reared is\r\nastonishing; from one manor Lord Berkeley obtained 2,151 pigeons in a\r\nsingle year. No one but the lord was allowed to keep them, and they\r\nwere one of the chief grievances of the villeins, who saw their seed\r\ndevoured by these pests without redress. Their dung, too, was one of\r\nthe most valued manures. Lord Berkeley, like other landlords, went\r\noften in progress from one of his manors and farmhouses to another,\r\nmaking his stay at each of them for one or two nights, overseeing and\r\ndirecting the husbandry. The castle of the great noble consumed an\r\nenormous amount of food in the course of the year; from two manors on\r\nthe Berkeley estate came to the 'standinghouse' of the lord in twelve\r\nmonths, 17,000 eggs, 1,008 pigeons, 91 capons, 192 hens, 288 ducks,\r\n388 chickens, 194 pigs, 45 calves, 315 quarters of wheat, 304 quarters\r\nof oats; and from several other manors came the like or greater store,\r\nbesides goats, sheep, oxen, butter, cheese, nuts, honey, &c.[128] Even\r\nthe lavish hospitality of the lords, and the great number of their\r\nretainers, must have had some difficulty in disposing of these huge\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nThe examining of their bailiff's accounts must have taken a\r\nconsiderable portion of the landlord's time, for those of each manor\r\nwere kept most minutely, and set forth, among other items, 'in what\r\nsort he husbanded' the demesne farms, 'what sorts of cattle he kept in\r\nthem, and what kinds of graine he yearly sowed according to the\r\nquality and condition of the ground, and how those kinds of graine\r\neach second or third yeare were exchanged or brought from one manor to\r\nanother as the vale corne into an upland soyle, and contrarily'. And\r\nwe are told incidentally he 'set with hand, not sowed his beanes'. He\r\nwas also accustomed to move his live stock from one manor to another,\r\nas they needed it.\r\n\r\nThe accounts also stated what days' works were due from each tenant\r\naccording to the season of the year, and at the end of each year there\r\nwas a careful valuation of live and dead stock.[129]\r\n\r\nThe difference\r\nbetween the smaller gentry and the more important yeomen[130] who\r\nfarmed their own land must have been very slight. No doubt both of\r\nthem were very rough and ignorant men, who knew a great deal about the\r\ncultivation of their land and very little about anything else. We may\r\nbe sure that the ordinary house of both was generally of wood; as\r\nthere is no stone in many parts of England, and bricks were not\r\nreintroduced till the fourteenth century and spread slowly. Even in\r\nElizabeth's reign, Harrison[131] tells us that 'the ancient houses of\r\nour gentry are yet for the most part of strong timber', and he even\r\nthinks that houses made of oak were luxurious, for in times past men\r\nhad been contented with houses of willow, plum, and elm, but now\r\nnothing but oak was good enough; and he quaintly says that the men who\r\nlived in the willow houses were as tough as oak, and those who lived\r\nin the oak as soft as willow. There are very few mansions left of the\r\ntime before Edward III, for being of timber they naturally decayed.\r\n\r\nIn a lease, dated 1152, of a manor house belonging to S. Paul's\r\nCathedral,[132] is a description of a manor house which contained a\r\nhall 35 feet long, 30 feet broad, and 22 feet high; that is, 11 feet\r\nto the tie beam and 11 feet from that to the ridge board; showing that\r\nthe roof was open and that there were no upper rooms. There was a\r\nchamber between the hall and the thalamus or inner room which was 12\r\nfeet long, 17 feet broad, and 17 feet high, the roof being open as in\r\nthe hall; and the thalamus was 22 feet long, 16 feet broad, and 18\r\nfeet high. About the same date the Manor house of Thorp was larger,\r\nand contained a hall, a chamber, tresantia (apparently part of the\r\nhall or chamber separated by a screen to form an antechamber), two\r\nprivate rooms, a kitchen, brew-house, malt-house, dairy, ox shed, and\r\nthree small hen-houses.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary manor house of the Middle Ages contained three rooms at\r\nleast, of mean aspect, the floor even of the hall, which was the\r\nprincipal eating and sleeping room, being of dirt; and when there was\r\nan upper room or solar added, which began to be done at the end of the\r\ntwelfth century,[133] access to it was often obtained by an outside\r\nstaircase.\r\n\r\nIf the manor house belonged to the owner of many manors, it was\r\nsometimes inhabited by his bailiff.\r\n\r\nThe barns on the demesnes were often as important buildings as the\r\nmanor houses; one at Wickham, belonging to the canons of S. Paul's[134]\r\nin the twelfth century, was 55 feet long, 13 feet high from the floor\r\nto the principal beam, and 10-1/2 feet more to the ridge board; the\r\nbreadth between the pillars was 19-1/2 feet, and on each side it had a\r\nwing or aisle 6-1/2 feet wide and 6-1/2 feet high. The amount of corn\r\nin the barn was often scored on the door-posts.[135] In the manor\r\nhouses chimneys rarely existed, the fire being made in the middle of\r\nthe hall. Even in the early seventeenth century in Cheshire there were\r\nno chimneys in the farmhouses, and there the oxen were kept under the\r\nsame roof as the farmer and his family.[136] When chimneys did come in\r\nthey were not much thought of. 'Now we have chimneys our tenderlings\r\ncomplain of rheums, catarrhs, and poses (colds);' for the smoke not\r\nonly hardened the timbers, but was said by Harrison to be an excellent\r\nmedicine for man. Instead of glass there was much lattice, and that\r\nmade either of wicker or fine rifts of oak in checkerwise, and horn\r\nwas also used. Beds, of course, were a luxury, the owner of the manor,\r\nhis guests, and retainers flung themselves down on the hall floor\r\nafter supper and all slept together, though sometimes rough mattresses\r\nwere brought in.\r\n\r\nFurniture was rude and scanty. In 1150 the farm implements and\r\nhousehold furniture on the Manor of 'Waleton' was valued and consisted\r\nof 4 carts, 3 baskets, a basket used in winnowing corn, a pair of\r\nmillstones, 10 tubs, 4 barrels, 2 boilers of lead with stoves, 2\r\nwooden bowls, 3 three-legged tables, 20 dishes or platters, 2\r\ntablecloths worth 6d., 6 metal bowls, half a load of the invaluable\r\nsalt, 2 axes, a table with trestles (the usual form of table), and 5\r\nbeehives made of rushes.[137] These articles were handed down from one\r\ngeneration to another, and in a lease made 150 years afterwards of the\r\nsame manor most of them reappear. The greater part of the furniture,\r\nuntil the fifteenth century, was most likely made by migratory\r\nworkmen, who travelled from village to village; for except the rudest\r\npieces it was beyond the village carpenter, and shops there were none.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be expected that when the master lived in this manner the\r\nlot of the labourer was a very good one. His home was miserably poor,\r\ngenerally of 'wattle and dab', sometimes wholly of mud and clay; many\r\nwith only one room for all purposes. A bill is still in existence for\r\na house, if it can be called one, built in 1306 for two labourers by\r\nQueen's College, Oxford, which cost 20s. in all, and was a mere hovel\r\nwithout floor, ceiling, or chimney.[138] Their wretched houses appear\r\nto have been built on the bare earth, and unfloored. Perhaps as time\r\nwent on a rude upper storey was added, the floor of which was made of\r\nrough poles or hurdles and was reached by a ladder. The furniture was\r\nmiserably poor; a few pots and pans, cups and dishes, and some tools\r\nwould exhaust the list.[139] The goods and chattels of a landless\r\nlabourer in 1431 consisted of a dish, an adze, a brass pot, 2 plates,\r\n2 augers, an axe, a three-legged stool, and a barrel.[140] Englishmen\r\nof all classes were hopelessly dirty in their habits; even till the\r\nsixteenth century they were noted above other countries for the\r\nprofuseness of their diet and their unclean ways. Erasmus spoke of the\r\nfloor of his house as inconceivably filthy. To save fuel, the\r\nlabourer's family in the cold season all lay huddled in a heap on the\r\nfloor, 'pleasantly and hot', as Barclay the poet tells us; and if he\r\never had a bed it was a bundle of fern or straw thrown down, with his\r\ncloak as a coverlet, though thus he was just as well off as his social\r\nsuperiors, for with them the loose cloak of the day was a common\r\ncovering for the night. He was constantly exposed to disease, for\r\nsanitary precautions were ignored; at the entrance of his hovel was a\r\nhuge heap of decaying refuse, poisoning air and water. Even in the\r\nsixteenth century a foreigner noticed that 'the peasants dwell in\r\nsmall huts and pile up their refuse out of doors in heaps so high that\r\nyou cannot see their houses'.[141] Diseased animals were constantly\r\neaten, vegetables were few, and in the winter there was no fresh meat\r\nfor any one, except game and rabbits and, for the well-to-do, fish,\r\nbut we may doubt if the peasant got any but salt fish. The consequence\r\nwas that leprosy and kindred ailments were common; and we do not\r\nwonder that plagues were frequent and slew the people like flies. The\r\npeasants' food consisted largely of corn. In the bailiff's accounts of\r\nthe Manor of Woodstock in 1242, six servants at Handborough received\r\n41-1/2 bushels of corn each, 2 ox herds at Combe received the same, and\r\n4 servants at Bladon had 36 bushels each. In 1274 at Bosham, and in\r\n1288 at Stoughton in Sussex, the allowance was the same.[142] The\r\nwriter of the anonymous _Treatise on Husbandry_ says that in his time,\r\nthe thirteenth century, the average annual allowance of corn to a\r\nlabourer was 36 bushels.[143] Fish, too, seem to have formed a large\r\nportion of his diet; all classes ate enormous quantities of fish,\r\nbefore the Reformation, in Lent and on fast days, and the labourer was\r\nconstantly given salt herrings as part of his pay. In 1359, at\r\nHawsted, the villeins when working were allowed 2 herrings a day, some\r\nmilk, a loaf, and some drink.[144] Eden[145] says his food consisted\r\nof a few fish, principally herrings, a loaf of bread, and some beer;\r\nbut we must certainly add pork, which was his stand-by then as\r\nnow.[146] In the fourteenth century, at all events, there were three\r\nkinds of bread in use--white bread, ration bread, and black bread; and\r\nit was no doubt the latter that the peasant ate.[147] Clothing was\r\ndear and cloth coarse, the most valuable personal property consisting\r\nof clothing and metal vessels. Shirts were the subject of charitable\r\ngifts.[148] By 37 Edw. III, c. 14, labourers were not to wear any\r\nmanner of cloth but 'blanket and russet wool of 12d.' and girdles of\r\nlinen. If they wore anything more extravagant it was forfeited to the\r\nking.\r\n\r\nTo the labourer of modern times the life of his forefathers would have\r\nseemed unutterably dull. No books, no newspapers, no change of scene\r\nby cheap excursions, no village school, no politics. The very\r\ncultivation of the soil by the old three-course system was monotonous.\r\nBut there were bright spots in his existence: the village church not\r\nonly afforded him the consolations of religion but also entertainments\r\nand society. Religion in the Middle Ages was a part of the people's\r\ndaily life, and its influence permeated even their amusements.\r\nMiracles and mystery plays, played in the churches and churchyards,\r\nwere a common feature in village life; as were the church ales or\r\nparish meetings held four or five times a year, where cakes and beer\r\nwere purchased from the churchwarden and consumed for the good of the\r\nparish. Indeed, there can be no doubt that there was much more\r\nsociability than to-day, in the country at least. Labour was lightened\r\nby the co-operation of the common fields; common shepherds and\r\nherdsmen watched the sheep and cattle of the different tenants, 'a\r\ncommon mill ground the corn, a common oven baked the bread, a common\r\nsmith worked at a common forge.' His existence, moreover, was\r\nenlivened by a considerable number of sports. A statute at the end of\r\nthe fourteenth century (12 Ric. II, c. 6) says he was fond of playing\r\nat tennis(!), football, quoits, dice, casting the stone, and other\r\ngames, which this statute forbad him, and enacted that he should use\r\nhis bow and arrows on Sundays and holidays instead of such idle sport.\r\nThis is a foretaste of the modern sentiment that seeks to wean him\r\nfrom watching football matches and take to miniature rifle clubs. He\r\nwas also, like some of his successors, fond of poaching, though he\r\nappears to have been rash enough to indulge in it by day. 13 Ric. II,\r\nc. 13, says he was prone on holidays, when good Christian people be in\r\nchurch hearing divine service, to go hunting with greyhounds and other\r\ndogs, in the parks and warrens of the lord and of others, and\r\nsometimes these hunts were turned into conferences and conspiracies,'\r\nfor to rise and disobey their allegiance', such as preceded the\r\nPeasants' Revolt of 1381; and accordingly no one who did not own lands\r\nworth 40s. a year was to keep a dog to hunt, or ferrets other\r\n'engines': the first game law on the English statute book.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[127] Smyth, _Lives of the Berkeleys_, i. 302.

Arable land had been until now largely in excess of\r\npasture, the cultivation of corn was the chief object of agriculture,\r\nbread forming a much larger proportion of men's diet than now. This\r\nbegan to change. Much of the land was laid down to grass, and there\r\nwas a steady increase in sheep farming; thus commenced that revolution\r\nin farming which in the sixteenth century led Harrison to say that\r\nEngland was mainly a stock-raising country. The lords also let a\r\nconsiderable amount of their demesne land on leases for years. 'Then\r\nbegan the times to alter' says Smyth of the Lord Berkeley of the end\r\nof the fourteenth century, 'and hee with them, and he began to tack\r\nother men's cattle on his pasture by the week, month, and quarter, and\r\nto sell his meadow grounds by the acre. And in the time of Henry IV\r\nstill more and more was let, and in succeeding times. As for the days'\r\nworks of the copyhold tenants, they also were turned into money.'[149]\r\nSuch leases had been used long before this, but this is the date of\r\ntheir great increase. In the thirteenth century a lease of 2 acres of\r\narable land in Nowton, Suffolk, let the land at 6d. an acre per annum\r\nfor a term of six years.[150] It contains no clauses about\r\ncultivation; the landlord warrants the said 2 acres to the tenant, and\r\nthe tenant agrees to give them up at the end of the term freely and\r\npeaceably. The deed was indented, sealed, and witnessed by several\r\npersons. The impoverished landlords also let much of their land on\r\nstock and land leases. The custom of stocking the tenants' land was a\r\nvery ancient one: the lord had always found the oxen for the plough\r\nteams of the villeins. In the leases of the manors of S. Paul's in the\r\ntwelfth century the tenant for life received stock both live and dead,\r\nwhich when he entered was carefully enumerated in the lease, and at\r\nthe end of the tenancy he had to leave behind the same quantity.[151]\r\nIt was a common practice also, before the Black Death, for the lord to\r\nlet out cows and sheep at so much per head per annum.[152] The stock\r\nand land lease therefore was no novelty. In 1410 there is a lease of\r\nthe demesne lands at Hawsted by which the landlord kept the manor\r\nhouse and its appurtenances in his own hands, the tenant apparently\r\nhaving the farm buildings, which he was to keep in repair. He was to\r\nreceive at the beginning of the term 20 cows and one bull, worth 9s.\r\neach; 4 stotts, worth 10s. each; and 4 oxen, worth 13s. 4d. each;\r\nwhich, or their value in money, were to be delivered up at the end of\r\nthe term. The tenant was also to leave at the end of the lease as many\r\nacres well ploughed, sown, and manured as he found at the beginning.\r\nOtherwise the landlord was not to interfere with the cultivation. If\r\nthe rent or any part thereof was in arrear for a fortnight after the\r\ntwo fixed days for payment, the landlord might distrain; and if for a\r\nmonth, he might re-enter: and both parties bound themselves to forfeit\r\nthe then huge sum of £100 upon the violation of any clause of the\r\nlease.[153] There is a lease[154] of a subsequent date (the twentieth\r\nyear of Henry VIII), but one which well illustrates the custom now so\r\nprevalent, granted by the Prior of the Monastery of Lathe in Somerset\r\nto William Pole of Combe, Edith his wife, and Thomas his son, for\r\ntheir lives. With the land went 360 wethers. For the land they paid 16\r\nquarters of best wheat, 'purelye thressyd and wynowed,' 22 quarters of\r\nbest barley, and were to carry 4 loads of wood and fatten one ox for\r\nthe prior yearly; the ox to be fattened in stall with the best hay,\r\nthe only way then known of fattening oxen. For the flock of wethers\r\nthey paid £6 yearly. The tenants were bound to keep hedges, ditches,\r\nand gates in repair. Also they were bound by a 'writing obligatory' in\r\nthe sum of £100 to deliver up the wether flock whole and sound, 'not\r\nrotten, banyd,[155] nor otherwise diseased.' The consequence of the\r\nspread of leases was that the portion of the demesne lands which the\r\nlords farmed themselves dwindled greatly, or it was turned from arable\r\ninto grass. Stock and land leases survived in some parts till the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century, when it was still the custom for\r\nthe landlord to stock the land and receive half the crop for\r\nrent.[156] According to the _Domesday of S. Paul_, in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, a survey of eighteen manors containing 24,000 acres showed\r\nthree-eighths of the land in demesne, the rest in the hands of the\r\ntenants. In 1359 the lord of the principal manor at Hawsted held in\r\nhis own hand 572 acres of arable land, worth 4d. to 6d. an acre rent,\r\nand 50 acres of meadow, worth 2s. an acre.[157] He had also pasture\r\nfor 24 cows, which was considered worth 36s. a year, and for 12 horses\r\nand 12 oxen worth 48s. a year, with 40 acres of wood, estimated at 1s.\r\nan acre. In 1387, however, the arable land had decreased to 320 acres,\r\nbut the stock had increased, and now numbered 4 cart horses, 6 stotts\r\nor smaller horses, 10 oxen, 1 bull, 26 cows, 6 heifers, 6 calves, 92\r\nwethers, 20 hoggerells or two-year-old sheep, 1 gander, 4 geese, 30\r\ncapons, 26 hens, and only one cock. The dairy of 26 cows was let out,\r\naccording to the custom of the time, for £8 a year; and we are told\r\nthat the oxen were fed on oats, and shod in the winter only.\r\n\r\nBut if the position of the lords was severely affected by the great\r\npestilence that of the villeins was also. The villein himself was\r\nbecoming a copyholder; in the thirteenth century the nature of his\r\nholding had been written on the court roll, before long he was given a\r\ncopy of the roll, and by the fifteenth century he was a\r\ncopyholder.[158] There was, too, a new spirit abroad in this century\r\nof disorganization and reform, which stirred even the villeins with a\r\ndesire for better conditions of life. These men, thus rising to a more\r\nassured position and animated by new hopes, saw all round them hired\r\nlabourers obtaining, in spite of the Statute of Labourers, double the\r\namount of wages they had formerly received, while they were bound down\r\nto the same services as before. The advance in prices was further\r\nincreased by the king's issuing in 1351 an entirely new coinage, of\r\nthe same fineness but of less weight than the old; so that the demands\r\nof the labourers after the Black Death were largely justified by the\r\ndepreciation in the currency.[159] There had also arisen at this time,\r\nowing to the increase in the wealth of the country, a new class of\r\nlandlords who did not care for the old system[160]; and it is probably\r\nthese men who are meant by the statute I Ric. II, c. 6, which\r\ncomplains that the villeins daily withdrew their services to their\r\nlords at the instigation of various counsellors and abettors, who made\r\nit appear by 'colour of certain exemplifications made out of the Book\r\nof Domesday' that they were discharged from their services, and\r\nmoreover gathered themselves in great routs and agreed to aid each\r\nother in resisting their lords, so that justices were appointed to\r\ncheck this evil. But there were other 'counsellors and abettors' of\r\nthe Peasants' Revolt than the new landlords. One of its most\r\ninteresting features to modern readers is its thorough organization.\r\nTravelling agents and agitators like John Ball were all over the\r\ncountry, money was subscribed and collected, and everything was ripe\r\nfor the great rising of 1381, which was brought to a head by the bad\r\ngrading of the poll tax of King Richard. It has been said that the\r\nchief grievance of the villeins was that the lords of manors were\r\nattempting to reimpose commuted services, but judging by the petition\r\nto the King when he met them at Mile-end there can be no doubt that\r\nthe chief grievance was the continuance of existing services. 'We\r\nwill', said they, 'that ye make us free for ever, and that we be\r\ncalled no more bond, or so reputed.' Also, as Walsingham says,[161]\r\nthey were careful to destroy the rolls and ancient records whereby\r\ntheir services were fixed, and to put to death persons learned in the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nAs every one knows, the revolt was a failure; and whether it\r\nultimately helped much to extinguish serfdom is doubtful. It probably,\r\nlike the pestilence, accelerated a movement which had been for some\r\ntime in progress and was inevitable. There is ample evidence to prove\r\nthat there was a very general continuance of predial services after\r\nthe revolt, though they went on rapidly decreasing. One of the chief\r\nmethods adopted by the villeins to gain their freedom was desertion,\r\nand so common did this become that apparently the mere threat of\r\ndesertion enabled the villein to obtain almost any concession from his\r\nlord, who was afraid lest his land should be utterly deserted. The\r\nresult was that by the middle of the fifteenth century the abolition\r\nof labour services was approaching completion.[162] It lingered on,\r\nand Fitzherbert lamented in Elizabeth's reign the continuance of\r\nvilleinage as a disgrace to England; but it had then nearly\r\ndisappeared, and was unheard of after the reign of James I.[163]\r\n\r\nSeven years after the Peasants' Revolt another attempt was made to\r\nregulate agricultural wages by the statute 12 Ric. II, c. 4, which\r\nstated that 'the hires of the said servants and labourers have not\r\nbeen put on certainty before this time', though we have seen that the\r\nAct of 1351 tried to settle wages. In the preamble it is said that the\r\nstatute was enacted because labourers 'have refused for a long season\r\nto work without outrageous and excessive hire', and owing to the\r\nscarcity of labourers 'husbands' could not pay their rents, a sentence\r\nwhich shows the general use of money rents.\r\n\r\nThe wages were as follows, apparently with food:--\r\n\r\n                                                     s.  d.\r\n\r\n  A bailiff annually, and clothing once a year       13  4\r\n  A master hind, without clothing                    10  0\r\n  A carter,          \"        \"                      10  0\r\n  A shepherd,        \"        \"                      10  0\r\n  An ox or cow herd  \"        \"                       6  8\r\n  Swine herd or female labourer, without clothing     6  0\r\n  A plough driver, without clothing                   7  0\r\n\r\nThe farm servants' food would be worth considerably more than the\r\nactual cash he received; a quarter of wheat, barley, and rye mixed\r\nevery nine weeks was no unusual allowance, which at 4s. 4d. would be\r\nworth about 25s. a year. He would also have his harvest allowance,\r\nthough the statute above forbids any perquisites, worth about 3s., and\r\nsometimes it was accompanied by the gift of a pig, some beer, or some\r\nherrings.[164] His wife also, at a time when women did the same work\r\nas the men, could earn 1d. a day, and his boy perhaps 1/2d. If his\r\nwages were wholly paid in money, we may say that in the last half of\r\nthe fourteenth century the ordinary labourer earned 3d. a day, so that\r\nas corn and pork, his chief food, had not risen at all, he was much\r\nbetter off than in the preceding 100 years.\r\n\r\nCullum, in his invaluable _History of Hawsted_, gives us a picture of\r\nharvesting on the demesne lands in 1389 which shows an extraordinarily\r\nbusy scene. There were 200 acres of all kinds of corn to be gathered\r\nin, and over 300 people took part; though apparently such a crowd was\r\nonly collected for the two principal days of the harvest, and it must\r\nbe remembered that the towns were emptied into the country at this\r\nimportant season. The number of people for one day comprised a carter,\r\nploughman, head reaper, cook, baker, brewer, shepherd, daya\r\n(dairymaid); 221 hired reapers; 44 pitchers, stackers, and reapers\r\n(not hired, evidently villeins paying their rents by work); 22 other\r\nreapers, hired for goodwill (_de amore_); and 20 customary tenants.\r\nThis small army of men consumed 22 bushels of wheat, 8 pennyworth of\r\nbeer, and 41 bushels of malt, worth 18s. 9-1/2d.; meat to the value of\r\n9s. 11-1/2d.; fish and herrings, 5s. 1d.; cheese, butter, milk, and\r\neggs, 8s. 3-1/2d.; oatmeal, 5d. salt, 3d.; pepper and saffron, 10d.,\r\nthe latter apparently introduced into England in the time of Edward\r\nIII, and much used for cooking and medicine, but it gradually went out\r\nof fashion, and by the end of the eighteenth century was only\r\ncultivated in one or two counties, notably Essex where Saffron Walden\r\nrecalls its use; candles, 6d.; and 5 pairs of gloves 10d.[165]\r\n\r\nThe presentation of gloves was a common custom in England; and these\r\nwould be presented as a sign of good husbandry, as in the case of the\r\nrural bridegroom in the account of Queen Elizabeth's visit to\r\nKenilworth who wore gloves to show he was a good farmer. Tusser bids\r\nthe farmer give gloves to his reapers. The custom was still observed\r\nat Hawsted in 1784, and in Eden's time, 1797, the bursars of New\r\nCollege, Oxford, presented each of their tenants with two pairs, which\r\nthe recipients displayed on the following Sunday at church by\r\nconspicuously hanging their hands over the pew to show their\r\nneighbours they had paid their rent. In this account of the Hawsted\r\nharvest the large number of hired men and the few customary tenants is\r\nnoteworthy as a sign of the times, for before the Black Death the\r\nharvest work on the demesne was the special work of the latter.\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century the long series of corn laws was commenced\r\nwhich was to agitate Englishmen for centuries, and after an apparently\r\nfinal settlement in 1846 to reappear in our day.[166] It was the\r\npolicy of Edward III to make food plentiful and cheap for the whole\r\nnation, without special regard to the agricultural interest: and by 34\r\nEdw. III, c. 20, the export of corn to any foreign part except Calais\r\nand Gascony, then British possessions, or to certain places which the\r\nking might permit, was forbidden. Richard II, however, reversed this\r\npolicy in answer to the complaints of agriculturists whose rents were\r\nfalling,[167] and endeavoured to encourage the farmer and especially\r\nthe corn-grower; for he saw the landlords turning their attention to\r\nsheep instead of corn, owing to the high price of labour. Accordingly,\r\nto give the corn-growers a wider market, he allowed his subjects by\r\nthe statute 17 Ric. II, c. 7, to carry corn, on paying the duties due,\r\nto what parts they pleased, except to his enemies, subject however to\r\nan order of the Council; and owing to the interference of the Council\r\nthe law probably became a dead letter, at all events we find it\r\nconfirmed and amended by 4 Hen. VI, c. 5.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition of export must have been a serious blow to those\r\ncounties near the sea, for it was much easier to send corn by ship to\r\nforeign parts than over the bad roads of England to some distant\r\nmarket.[168] Indeed, judging by the great and frequent discrepancy of\r\nprices in different places at the same date, the dispatch of corn from\r\none inland locality to another was not very frequent. Richard also\r\nattempted to stop the movement, which had even then set in, of the\r\ncountrymen to the growing towns, forbidding by 12 Ric. II, c. 5, those\r\nwho had served in agriculture until 12 years of age to be apprenticed\r\nin the towns, but to 'abide in husbandry'.\r\n\r\nOne of the most unjust customs of the Middle Ages was that which bade\r\nthe tenants of manors, except those who held the _jus faldae_, fold\r\ntheir sheep on the land of the lord, thus losing both the manure and\r\nthe valuable treading.[169] However, sometimes, as in Surrey, the\r\nsheepfold was in a fixed place and the manure from it was from time to\r\ntime taken out and spread on the land.[170]\r\n\r\nIn the same district horses had been hitherto used for farm work, as\r\nit was considered worthy of note that oxen were beginning to be added\r\nto the horse teams. The milk of two good cows in twenty-four weeks was\r\nconsidered able to make a wey of cheese, and in addition half a gallon\r\nof butter a week; and the milk of 20 ewes was equal to that of 3 cows.\r\n\r\nOn the Manor of Flaunchford, near Reigate, the demesne land amounted\r\nto 56 acres of arable and two meadows, but there must have been the\r\nusual pasture in addition to keep the following head of stock: 13\r\ncows, who in the winter were fed from the racks in the yard; 4 calves,\r\nbought at 1s. each; 12 oxen for ploughing, whose food was oats and\r\nhay--a very large number for 56 acres of arable, and they were\r\nprobably used on another manor; 1 stott, used for harrowing; a goat,\r\nand a sow.\r\n\r\n                                                   £   s.   d.\r\n\r\n  In 1382 the total receipts of this manor were    8   1   9-1/2\r\n  The total expenses                               7   0   5\r\n                                                  --------------\r\n                                 Profit           £1   1   4-1/2\r\n                                                  ==============\r\n\r\n  Among the receipts were:--\r\n    For the lord's plough, let to farmers (perhaps\r\n      this accounts for the large team of oxen kept)    6   8\r\n    14 bushels of apples                                1   2\r\n    5 loads of charcoal                                16   8\r\n    A cow                                              10   0\r\n  Among the payments:--\r\n    For keeping plough in repair, and the wages of a\r\n      blacksmith, one year by agreement                 6   8\r\n    Making a new plough from the lord's timber              6\r\n    Mowing 2 acres of meadow                            1   0\r\n    Making and carrying hay of ditto, with\r\n      help of lord's servants                               4\r\n    Threshing wheat, peas, and tares, per quarter           4\r\n       \"      oats, per quarter                             1-1/2\r\n    Winnowing 3 quarters of corn                            1\r\n    Cutting and binding wheat and oats, per acre            6\r\n\r\nOn the Manor of Dorking the harvest lasted five weeks as a rule; the\r\nfore feet only of oxen used for ploughing, and of heifers used for\r\nharrowing, were shod. For washing and shearing sheep 10d. a hundred\r\nwas the price; ploughing for winter corn cost 6d. an acre, and\r\nharrowing 1/2d. 30-1/2 acres of barley produced 41-1/2 quarters; 28\r\nacres of oats produced 38-1/2 quarters; 13 cows were let for the\r\nseason at 5s. each. In the same reign, at Merstham, the demesne lands\r\nof 166-1/2 acres were let on lease with all the live and dead stock,\r\nwhich was valued at £22 9s. 3d., and the rent was £36 or about 4s. 4d.\r\nan acre, an enormous price even including the stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[149] Smyth, _Lives of the Berkeleys_, ii. 5.

In 1527, according to Holinshed it rained from April 12 to\r\nJune 3 every day or night; in May thirty hours without ceasing; and\r\nthe floods did much damage to the corn. In 1528 incessant deluges of\r\nrain prevented the corn being sown in the spring, and grain had to be\r\nimported from Germany. The price of wheat was a trifle higher than in\r\nthe period 1259-1400; barley, oats, and beans lower; rye higher.[171]\r\nOxen and cows were dearer, horses about the same, sheep a little\r\nhigher, pigs the same, poultry and eggs dearer, wool the same, cheese\r\nand butter dearer. The price of wheat was sometimes subject to\r\nastonishing fluctuations: in 1439 it varied from 8s. to 26s. 8d.; in\r\n1440 from 4s. 2d. to 25s. The rent of land continued the same, arable\r\naveraging 6d. an acre,[172] though this was partly due to the fact\r\nthat rents, although now generally paid in money, were still fixed and\r\ncustomary; for the purchase value of land had now risen to twenty\r\nyears instead of twelve.[173] The art of farming hardly made any\r\nprogress, and the produce of the land was consequently about the same\r\nor a little better than in the preceding period.[174]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fourteenth century the ordinary wheat crop at\r\nHawsted was in favourable years about a quarter to the acre, but it\r\nwas often not more than 6 bushels; and this was on demesne land,\r\nusually better tilled than non-demesne land.[175] As for the labourer,\r\nit is well known that Thorold Rogers calls the fifteenth century his\r\ngolden age, and seeing that his days' wages, if he 'found himself',\r\nwere now 4d. and prices were hardly any higher all round than when he\r\nearned half the money in the thirteenth century, there is much to\r\nsupport his view. As to whether he was better off than the modern\r\nlabourer it is somewhat difficult to determine; as far as wages went\r\nhe certainly was, for his 4d. a day was equal to about 4s. now; it is\r\ntrue that on the innumerable holidays of the Church he sometimes did\r\nnot work,[176] but no doubt he then busied himself on his bit of\r\ncommon. But so many factors enter into the question of the general\r\nmaterial comfort of the labourer in different ages that it is almost\r\nimpossible to come to a satisfactory conclusion. Denton paints a very\r\ngloomy picture of him at this time[177]; so does Mr. Jessop, who says,\r\nthe agricultural labourers of the fifteenth century were, compared\r\nwith those of to-day, 'more wretched in their poverty, incomparably\r\nless prosperous in their prosperity; worse clad, worse fed, worse\r\nhoused, worse taught, worse governed; they were sufferers from\r\nloathsome diseases, of which their descendants know nothing; the very\r\nbeasts of the field were dwarfed and stunted; the disregard of to\r\nsell their corn at low prices to the detriment of the whole kingdom: a\r\ntypical example of the political economy of the time, which considered\r\nthe prosperity of agriculture indispensable to the welfare of the\r\ncountry, even if the consumer suffered. Accordingly, it was enacted\r\nthat wheat could be exported without a licence when it was under 6s.\r\n8d. a quarter, except to the king's enemies. On imports of corn there\r\nhad been no restriction until 1463, when 3 Edw. IV, c. 2 forbade the\r\nimport of corn when under 6s. 8d: a statute due partly to the fear\r\nthat the increase of pasture was a danger to tillage land and the\r\nnational food supply, and partly to the fact that the landed interest\r\nhad become by now fully awake to the importance of protecting\r\nthemselves by promoting the gains of the farmer.[178] It may be\r\ndoubted, however, if much wheat was imported except in emergencies at\r\nthis time, for many countries forbade export. These two statutes were\r\npractically unaltered till 1571,[179] and by that of 1463 was\r\ninitiated the policy which held the field for nearly 400 years.\r\n\r\nThorold Rogers denounces the landlords for legislating with the object\r\nof keeping up rents, but, as Mr. Cunningham has pointed out, this\r\nignores the fact that the land was the great fund of national wealth\r\nfrom which taxation was paid; if rents therefore rose it was a gain to\r\nthe whole country, since the fund from which the revenue was drawn was\r\nincreased.[180]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the high wages of agricultural labourers, the movement\r\ntowards the towns noticed by Richard II continued. The statute 7 Hen.\r\nIV, c. 17, asserts that there is a great scarcity of labourers in\r\nhusbandry and that gentlemen are much impoverished by the rate of\r\nwages; the cause of the scarcity lying in the fact that many people\r\nwere becoming weavers,[181] and it therefore re-enacted 12 Ric. II,\r\nc. 5, which ordained that no one who had been a servant in husbandry\r\nuntil 12 years old should be bound apprentice, and further enacted\r\nthat no person with less than 20s. a year in land should be able to\r\napprentice his son. Like many other statutes of the time this seems to\r\nhave been inoperative, for we find 23 Hen. VI, c. 12 (1444), enacting\r\nthat if a servant in husbandry purposed leaving his master he was to\r\ngive him warning, and was obliged either to engage with a new one or\r\ncontinue with the old. It also regulated the wages anew, those fixed\r\nshowing a substantial increase since the statute of 1388. By the\r\nyear:--\r\n\r\n  A bailiff was to have £1 3s. 4d., and 5s. worth of clothes.\r\n  A chief hind, carter, or shepherd, £1, and 4s. worth of clothes.\r\n  A common servant in husbandry, 15s., and 3s. 4d. worth of clothes.\r\n  A woman servant, 10s., and 4s. worth of clothes.\r\n  All with meat and drink.\r\n\r\nBy the day, in harvest, wages were to be:--\r\n\r\n  A mower, with meat and drink, 4d.; without, 6d.\r\n  A reaper or carter, with meat and drink, 3d.; without, 5d.\r\n  A woman or labourer, with meat and drink, 2d.; without, 4d.\r\n\r\nIn the next reign the labourer's dress was again regulated for him,\r\nand he was forbidden to wear any cloth exceeding 2s. a yard in price,\r\nnor any 'close hosen', apparently tight long stockings, nor any hosen\r\nat all which cost more than 14d.[182] Yeomen and those below them were\r\nforbidden to wear any bolsters or stuff of wool, cotton wadding, or\r\nother stuff in their doublets, but only lining; and somewhat\r\ngratuitously it was ordered that no one under the degree of a\r\ngentleman should wear pikes to his shoes.\r\n\r\nIn 1455 England's Thirty Years' War, the War of the Roses, began, and\r\nagriculture received another set back. The view that the war was a\r\nmere faction fight between nobles and their retainers, while the rest\r\nof the country went about their business, is somewhat exaggerated. No\r\ndoubt, the mass of Englishmen, as in the civil war of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, preferred to 'sit still', as Clarendon said, but the business\r\nof many must have been very much upset. The various armies were\r\ncompelled to obtain their supplies from the country, and with the\r\nlawless habits of the times plundered friend and foe alike, as\r\nCavalier and Roundhead did afterwards; and many a farmer must have\r\nseen all his stock driven off and his grain seized to feed the\r\ncombatants. For instance, it was said before the battle called Easter\r\nDay Field that all the tenants of Abbot's Ripton in Huntingdonshire\r\nwere copyholders of the Abbot of Ramsey, and the northern army lay\r\nthere so long that they impoverished the country and the tenants had\r\nto give up their copyholds through poverty.[183] The loss of life,\r\ntoo, must have told heavily on a country already suffering from\r\nfrequent pestilence. It is calculated that about one-tenth of the\r\nwhole population of the country were killed in battle or died of\r\nwounds and disease during the war; and as these must have been nearly\r\nall men in the prime of life, it is difficult to understand how the\r\neffect on the labour market was not more marked. The enclosing of land\r\nfor pasture farms, which we shall next have to consider, was probably\r\nin many cases an absolute necessity, for the number of men left to\r\ntill the soil must have been seriously diminished.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[171] See table at end of volume.

Enclosure\r\nwas of four kinds:\r\n\r\n  1. Enclosing the common arable fields for grazing, generally\r\n     in large tracts.\r\n\r\n  2. Enclosing the same by dividing them into smaller fields,\r\n     generally of arable.\r\n\r\n  3. Enclosing the common pasture, for grazing or tillage.\r\n\r\n  4. Enclosing the common meadows or mowing grounds.\r\n\r\nIt is the first mainly, and to a less degree the third of these, which\r\nwere so frequent a source of complaint in the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies; for the first, besides displacing the small holder, threw\r\nout of employment a large number of people who had hitherto gained\r\ntheir livelihood by the various work connected with tillage, and the\r\nthird deprived a large number of their common rights.\r\n\r\nThe first Enclosure Act was the Statute of Merton, passed in 1235, 20\r\nHenry III, c. 4, which permitted lords of manors to add to their\r\ndemesnes such parts of the waste pasture and woods as were beyond the\r\nneeds of the tenants. There is evidence, however, that enclosure,\r\nprobably of waste land, was going on before this statute, as the\r\ncharter of John, by which all Devonshire except Dartmoor and Exmoor\r\nwas deforested, expressly forbids the making of hedges, a proof of\r\nenclosure, in those two forests.[185] We may be sure that the needs of\r\nthe tenants were by an arbitrary lord estimated at a very low figure.\r\nAt the same time many proceeded in due legal form. Thomas, Lord\r\nBerkeley, about the period of the Act reduced great quantities of\r\nground into enclosures by procuring many releases of common land from\r\nfreeholders.[186] His successor, Lord Maurice, was not so observant of\r\nlegality. He had a wood wherein many of his tenants and freeholders\r\nhad right of pasture. He wished to make this into a park, and treated\r\nwith them for that purpose; but things not going smoothly, he made the\r\nwood into a park without their leave, and then treated with his\r\ntenants, most of whom perforce fell in with his highhanded plan; those\r\nwho did not 'fell after upon his sonne with suits, in their small\r\ncomfort and less gaines.'[187] Sometimes the rich made the law aid\r\ntheir covetousness, as did Roger Mortimer the paramour of the 'She\r\nWolf of France'. Some men had common of pasture in King's Norton Wood,\r\nWorcestershire, who, when Mortimer enclosed part of their common land\r\nwith a dike, filled the dike up, for they were deprived of their\r\ninheritance. Thereupon Mortimer brought an action of trespass against\r\nthem 'by means of jurors dwelling far from the said land', who were\r\nput on the panel by his steward, who was also sheriff of the county,\r\nand the commoners were convicted and cast in damages of £300, not\r\ndaring to appear at the time for fear of assault, or even death.[188]\r\nNeither dared they say a word about the matter till Mortimer was dead,\r\nwhen it is satisfactory to learn that Edward III gave them all their\r\nmoney back save 20 marks. We are told that Lord Maurice Berkeley\r\nconsolidated much of his demesne lands, throwing together the\r\nscattered strips and exchanging those that lay far apart from the\r\nmanor houses for those that lay near; trying evidently to get the home\r\nfarms into a ring fence as we should term it.[189] In this policy he\r\nwas followed by his successor Thomas the Second, who during his\r\nownership of the estate from 1281 to 1320, to the great profit of his\r\ntenants and himself, encouraged them to make exchanges, so as to make\r\ntheir lands lie in convenient parcels instead of scattered strips, by\r\nwhich he raised the rent of an acre from 4d. and 6d. to 1s. 6d.[190]\r\nThere is a deed of enclosure made in the year 1250, preserved, by\r\nwhich the free men of North Dichton 'appropriated and divided between\r\nthem and so kept for ever in fee all that place called Sywyneland,\r\nwith the moor,' and they were to have licence to appropriate that\r\nplace, which was common pasture (the boundaries of which are given),\r\n'save, however, to the grantor William de Ros and his heirs' common of\r\npasture in a portion thereof named by bounds, with entry and exit for\r\nbeasts after the wheat is carried. The men of North Dichton were also\r\nto have all the wood called Rouhowthwicke, and to do what they liked\r\nwith it.[191] In return they gave the lord 10 marks of silver and a\r\nconcession as regards a certain wood. It has been noticed that the\r\nBlack Death, besides causing many of the landlords to let their\r\ndemesnes, also made them turn much tillage into grass to save labour,\r\nwhich had grown so dear. We have also seen that the statutes\r\nregulating wages were of little effect, and they went on rising, so\r\nthat more land was laid down to grass. The landowners may be said to\r\nhave given up ordinary farming and turned to sheep raising.\r\n\r\nEnglish wool could always find a ready sale, although Spanish sheep\r\nfarming had developed greatly; and the profitable trade of growing\r\nwool attracted the new capitalist class who had sprung up, so that\r\nthey often invested their recently made fortunes in it, buying up many\r\nof the great estates that were scattered during the war.[192]\r\n\r\nThe increase of sheep farming was assisted by the fact that the\r\ndomestic system of the manufacture of wool, which supplanted the guild\r\nsystem, led, owing to its rapid and successful growth, to a constant\r\nand increasing demand for wool. At the same time this development of\r\nthe cloth industry helped to alleviate the evils it had itself caused\r\nby giving employment to many whom the agricultural changes wholly or\r\npartially deprived of work. 'It is important to remember, that where\r\npeasant proprietorship and small farming did maintain their ground it\r\nwas largely due to the domestic industries which supplemented the\r\nprofits of agriculture.'[193]\r\n\r\nMuch of the land laid down to grass was demesne land, but many of the\r\ncommon arable fields were enclosed and laid down. John Ross of Warwick\r\nabout 1460 compares the country as he knew it with the picture\r\npresented by the Hundred Rolls in Edward I's time, showing how many\r\nvillages had been depopulated; and he mentions the inconvenience to\r\ntravellers in having to get down frequently to open the gates of\r\nenclosed fields.[194]\r\n\r\nEnclosure was really a sure sign of agricultural progress; nearly all\r\nthe agricultural writers from Fitzherbert onwards are agreed that\r\nenclosed land produced much more than uninclosed. Fitzherbert, in the\r\nfirst quarter of the sixteenth century, said an acre of land rented\r\nfor 6d. uninclosed was worth 8d. when enclosed. Gabriel Plattes, in\r\nthe seventeenth century, said an acre enclosed was worth four in\r\ncommon. In fact, the history of enclosures is part of the history of\r\nthe great revolution in agriculture by which the manorial system was\r\nconverted into the modern system as we know it to-day of several\r\nownership and the triumvirate of landlord, tenant farmer, and\r\nlabourer. No one could have objected to the enclosure of waste; it was\r\nthat of the common arable fields and of the common pasture that\r\nexcited the indignation of contemporaries. They saw many of the small\r\nholders displaced and the countryside depopulated; many of the\r\nlabourers were also thrown out of employment, for there was no need in\r\nenclosed fields of the swineherd and shepherd and oxherd who had\r\ntended the common flocks of the villagers in the old unfenced fields.\r\nBut much of the opposition was founded on ignorance and hatred of\r\nchange; England had been for ages mainly a corn-growing land, and,\r\nmany thought, ought to remain so. As a matter of fact, what much of\r\nthe arable land wanted was laying down to grass; it was worn out and\r\nneeded a rest. The common field system was wasteful; the land, for\r\ninstance, could never be properly ploughed, for the long narrow strips\r\ncould not be cross-ploughed, and much of it must have suffered\r\ngrievously from want of manure at a time when hardly any stock was\r\nkept in the winter to make manure. The beneficial effect of the rest\r\nis shown by the fact that at the end of the sixteenth century, when\r\nsome of the land came to be broken up, the produce per acre of wheat\r\nhad gone up largely.[195] Marling and liming the land, too, which had\r\nbeen the salvation of much of it for centuries, had gone out partly\r\nbecause of insecurity of tenure, partly because in the unsettled state\r\nof England men knew not if they could reap any benefit therefrom; and\r\npartly because, says Fitzherbert, men were lazier than their fathers.\r\nThere can be no doubt that enclosures were often accompanied with\r\ngreat hardships and injustice. Dugdale, speaking of Stretton in\r\nWarwickshire,[196] says that in Henry VII's time Thomas Twyford,\r\nhaving begun the depopulation thereof, decaying four messuages and\r\nthree cottages whereunto 160 acres of 'errable' land belonged, sold it\r\nto Henry Smith; which Henry, following that example, enclosed 640\r\nacres of land more, whereby twelve messuages and four cottages fell to\r\nruins and eighty persons there inhabiting, being employed about\r\ntillage and husbandry, were constrained to depart thence and live\r\nmiserably. By means whereof the church grew to such ruin that it was\r\nof no other use than for the shelter of cattle. A sad picture, and\r\ntrue of many districts, but much of the depopulation ascribed to\r\nenclosures was due to the devastation of the Civil Wars.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these enclosures, which began to change the England of\r\nopen fields into the country we know of hedgerows and winding roads,\r\ngreat part of the land was in a wild and uncultivated state of fen,\r\nheath, and wood, the latter sometimes growing right up to the walls of\r\nthe towns.[197] An unbroken series of woods and fens stretched right\r\nacross England from Lincoln to the Mersey, and northwards from the\r\nMersey to the Solway and the Tweed; Warwickshire, Northamptonshire,\r\nand Leicestershire were largely covered by forests, and Sherwood\r\nForest extended over nearly the whole of Notts. Cannock Chase was\r\ncovered with oaks, and in the forest of Needwood in Camden's time the\r\nneighbouring gentry eagerly pursued the cheerful sport of hunting. The\r\ngreat forest of Andredesweald, though much diminished, still covered a\r\nlarge part of Sussex, and the Chiltern district in Bucks and\r\nOxfordshire was thick with woods which hid many a robber. The great\r\nfen in the east covered 300,000 acres of land in six counties, in\r\nspite of various efforts to reclaim the land, and was to remain in a\r\nstate of marsh and shallow water till the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nNorth and west of the great fen was Hatfield Chase, 180,000 acres\r\nmostly swamp and bog, with here and there a strip of cultivated land,\r\nmuch of which had been tilled and neglected; a great part too of\r\nYorkshire was swamp, heath, and forest, and of Lancashire marshes and\r\nmosses, some of which were not drained till recent times. The best\r\ncorn-growing counties were those lying immediately to the north of\r\nLondon, stretching from Suffolk to Gloucestershire, and including the\r\nsouthern portions of Staffordshire and Leicestershire; Essex was a\r\ngreat cheese county; Hants, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire, and\r\nBedfordshire were famous for malt, and Leicestershire for peas and\r\nbeans. The population of England in 1485 was probably from two to two\r\nand a half millions. At the time of Domesday it was under two\r\nmillions, and from that date increased perhaps to nearly four millions\r\nat the time of the Black Death in 1348-9, which swept away from\r\none-third to one-half of the people, and repeated wars and pestilences\r\nseem to have kept it from increasing until Tudor times. Of the whole\r\npopulation no fewer than eleven-twelfths were employed in\r\nagriculture.[198]\r\n\r\nIt was sought to remedy enclosure and depopulation by legislation, and\r\nthe statute of 4 Hen. VII, c. 19, was passed, which stated in its\r\npreamble that where in some towns (meaning townships or villages) 200\r\npersons used to be occupied and lived by their lawful labours, now\r\nthere are occupied only two or three herdsmen, so that the residue\r\nfall into idleness, and husbandry is greatly decayed, churches\r\ndestroyed, the bodies there buried not prayed for, the parsons and\r\ncurates wronged, and the defence of this land enfeebled and impaired;\r\nthe latter point being wisely deemed one of the most serious defects\r\nin the new system of farming. Indeed, the encouragement of tillage was\r\nlargely prompted by the desire to see the people fed on good\r\nhome-grown corn and made strong and healthy by rural labour for the\r\ndefence of England. It therefore enacted that houses which within\r\nthree years before had been let for farms with 20 acres of tillage\r\nland should be kept in that condition, under a penalty of forfeiting\r\nhalf the profits to the king or the lord of the fee. Soon after Henry\r\nVIII ascended the throne came another statute, 6 Hen. VIII, c. 5, that\r\nall townships, villages, &c., decayed and turned from husbandry and\r\ntillage into pasture, shall by the owner be rebuilt and the land made\r\nmete for tillage within one year; and this was repeated and made\r\nperpetual by a law of the next year.[199]\r\n\r\nBut legislation was in vain; the price of wool was now beginning to\r\nadvance so that the attraction of sheep farming was irresistible, and\r\nlaws, which asked landowners and farmers to turn from what was\r\nprofitable to what was not, were little likely to be observed,\r\nespecially as the administration of these laws was in the hands of\r\nthose whose interest it was that they should not be observed.\r\n\r\nTheir ill success, however, did not deter the Parliament from fresh\r\nefforts. 25 Hen. VIII, c. 13, sets forth the condition of affairs in\r\nits preamble: as many persons have accumulated into few, great\r\nmultitude of farms and great plenty of cattle, especially sheep,\r\nputting such land as they can get into pasture, and enhanced the old\r\nrents and raised the prices of corn, cattle, wool, and poultry almost\r\ndouble, 'by reason whereof a mervaylous multitude and nombre of the\r\npeople of this realme be not able to provide drynke and clothes\r\nnecessary for themselves, but be so discoraged with myserie and\r\npovertie that they fall dayly to thefte and robberye or pitifully dye\r\nfor hunger and colde.' So greedy and covetous were some of these\r\naccumulators that they had as many as 24,000 sheep; and a good sheep,\r\nthat was used to be sold for 2s. 4d. or 3s. at the most, was now from\r\n4s. to 6s.; and a stone of clothing wool, that in some shires was\r\naccustomed to be sold for 18d. or 20d., is now 3s. 4d. to 4s.; and in\r\nothers, where it was 2s. 4d. to 3s. it is now 4s. 8d. to 5s.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore enacted that no man, with some exceptions, was to\r\nkeep more than 2,000 sheep at one time in any part of the realm,\r\nthough lambs under one year were not to count. The frequency of these\r\nlaws proves their inefficacy, and the conduct of Henry VIII was the\r\nchief cause of it; for while Parliament was complaining of the\r\ndecrease of tillage he gave huge tracts of land taken from the\r\nmonasteries to greedy courtiers, who evicted the tenants and lived on\r\nthe profits of sheep farming.[200] For the dissolution of the\r\nmonasteries was now taking Place,[201] and the best landowners in\r\nEngland, some of whom farmed their own land long after most of the lay\r\nlandlords had given it up or turned it into grass, and whose lands are\r\nsaid to have fetched a higher rent than any others, were robbed and\r\nruined. Including the dissolution of the monasteries and the\r\nconfiscation of the chantry lands in 1549 by Edward VI, about\r\none-fifteenth of the land of England changed hands at this time. The\r\ntransfer of the abbey lands to Henry's favourites was very prejudicial\r\nto farming; it was a source of serious dislocation of agricultural\r\nindustry, marked by all the inconvenience, injustice, and loss that\r\nattends a violent transfer of property. It is probable also that many\r\nof the monastic lands were let on stock and land leases; and the stock\r\nwas confiscated, with inevitable ruin to the tenant as well as the\r\nlandlord.[202] And not only was a serious injury wrought to\r\nagriculture by the spoliation of a large number of landlords generally\r\nnoted for their generosity and good farming, but with the religious\r\nhouses disappeared a large number of consumers of country produce, the\r\namount of which may be gathered from the following list of stores of\r\nthe great Abbey of Fountains at the dissolution: 2,356 horned cattle,\r\n1,326 sheep, 86 horses, 79 swine, and large quantities of wheat, oats,\r\nrye, and malt, with 392 loads of hay.[203] It must indeed have seemed\r\nto many as if the poor farmer was never to have any rest; no sooner\r\nwere the long wars over and pestilences in some sense diminished, than\r\nthe evils of enclosure and the dissolution of the monasteries came\r\nupon him. Many ills were popularly ascribed to the fall of the\r\nmonasteries; in an old ballad in Percy's _Reliques_ one of the\r\ncharacters says, in western dialect:--\r\n\r\n     'Chill tell the what, good vellowe,\r\n     Before the friers went hence,\r\n     A bushel of the best wheate\r\n     Was zold vor vorteen pence,\r\n     And vorty eggs a penny\r\n     That were both good and newe.'\r\n\r\nNOTE.--If any further proof were needed of the constant attention\r\ngiven by Parliament to agricultural matters, it would be furnished by\r\nthe Acts for the destruction of vermin.[204] Our forefathers had no\r\ndoubt that rooks did more harm than good, yearly destroying a\r\n'wonderfull and marvelous greate quantitie of corne and graine'; and\r\ndestroying the 'covertures of thatched housery, bernes, rekes,\r\nstakkes, and other such like'; so that all persons were to do their\r\nbest to kill them, 'on pain of a grevous amerciament'.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[184] Much the same tendencies were at work in other countries,\r\nespecially in Germany.\r\n\r\n[185] Slater, _English Peasantry and Enclosure_, 248.\r\n\r\n[186] Smyth, _Lives of the Berkeleys_, i. 113.\r\n\r\n[187] _Cal.

He was one of the Justices of Common Pleas, and\r\nhad been a farmer for forty years before he wrote his books on\r\nhusbandry, and on surveying in 1523, so that he knew what he was\r\nwriting about; 'there is nothing touching husbandry contained in this\r\nbook but I have had experience thereof and proved the same.' In spite\r\nof the increase of grazing in his time he says the 'plough is the most\r\nnecessarie instrument that an husbandman can occupy', and describes\r\nthose used in various counties; in Kent, for instance, 'they have some\r\ngo with wheeles as they do in many other places'; but the plough of\r\nhis time is apparently the same as that of Walter of Henley, and\r\naltered little till the seventeenth century. The rudeness of it may be\r\njudged from the fact that in some places it only cost 10d. or 1s.\r\nthough in other parts they were as much as 6s. or even 8s. He\r\nsays[205] it was too costly for a farmer to buy all his implements,\r\nwherefore it is necessary for him to learn to make them, as he had\r\ndone in the Middle Ages before the era of ready-made implements, when\r\nhe always bought the materials and put them together at home. On the\r\nvexed question of whether to use horses or oxen for ploughing, he says\r\nit depends on the locality; for instance, oxen will plough in tough\r\nclay and upon hilly ground, whereas horses will stand still; but\r\nhorses go faster than oxen on even ground and light ground, and are\r\n'quicke for carriages, but they be far more costly to keep in winter.'\r\n\r\nAccording to him, oxen had no shoes as horses had.[206] Here is his\r\ndescription of a harrow: it is 'made of six final peeces of timber\r\ncalled harow bulles, made either of ashe or oke; they be two yardes\r\nlong, and as much as the small of a man's leg; in every bulle are five\r\nsharpe peeces of iron called harow tyndes, set somewhat a slope\r\nforward.' This harrow, drawn by oxen, was good to break the big clods,\r\nand then the horse harrow came after to break the smaller clods. It\r\ndiffered slightly from the former, some having wooden tines. For\r\nweeding corn the chief instrument 'is a pair of tongs made of wood,\r\nand in dry weather ye must have a weeding hoke with a socket set upon\r\na staffe a yard long.'[207]\r\n\r\nHe recommends that grass be mown early, for the younger and greener\r\nthe grass is the softer and sweeter it will be when it is hay, and the\r\nseeds will be in it instead of fallen out as when left late; advice\r\nwhich many slovenly farmers need to-day. He does not approve of the\r\ncustom of reaping rye and wheat high up and mowing them after, but\r\nadvises that they be cut clean; barley and oats, however, should be\r\ncommonly mown. Both wheat and rye were to be sown at Michaelmas, and\r\nwere cast upon the fallow and ploughed under, two London bushels of\r\nwheat and rye being the necessary amount of seed per acre. In spite of\r\nhis praise of the plough he allows that the sheep 'is the most\r\nprofitablest cattel that a man can have', and he gives a list of their\r\ndiseases, among the things that rot them being a grass called\r\nsperewort, another called peny grass, while marshy ground, mildewed\r\ngrass, and grass growing upon fallow and therefore full of weeds were\r\nall conducive to rot. The chief cause, however, is mildew, the sign of\r\nwhose presence is the honeydew on the oak leaves. In buying cattle to\r\nfeed the purchaser is to see that the hair stare not, and that the\r\nbeast lacks no teeth, has a broad rib, a thick hide, and be loose\r\nskinned, for if it stick hard to his ribs he will not feed[208]; it\r\nshould be handled to see if it be soft on the forecrop, behind the\r\nshoulder, on the hindermost rib upon the huck bone, and at the nache\r\nby the tail. Among other diseases of cattle he mentions the gout,\r\n'commonly in the hinder feet'; but he never knew a man who could find\r\na remedy. He was a great advocate of enclosures; for it was much\r\nbetter to have several closes and pastures to put his cattle in, which\r\nshould be well quick-setted, ditched, and hedged, so as to divide\r\nthose of different ages, as this was more profitable than to have his\r\ncattle go before the herdsman (in the common field).\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above that Fitzherbert made no idle boast in\r\nsaying he wrote of what he knew, and much of his advice is applicable\r\nto-day, though the time is past for the farmer's wife to 'wynowe all\r\nmanner of cornes, to make malte, to shere corne, and in time of nede\r\nto helpe her husbande to fyll the mucke wayne or dounge carte, dryve\r\nthe plough, lode heye, corne, and such other'; though she may go or\r\nride to the market 'to sel butter, cheese, milke, eggs, chekyns,\r\nhennes, and geese.'[209] It appears that the horses of England at this\r\ntime had considerably deteriorated, for the statute 27 Hen. VIII, c.\r\n6, mentions the great decay of the breed, the cause it is stated being\r\nthat 'in most places of this Realme little horsis and naggis of small\r\nstature and valeu be suffered to depasture and also to covour marys\r\nand felys of very small stature'; therefore owners and farmers of deer\r\nparks shall keep in every such park two brood mares of 13 'hand\r\nfulles' (hands) at least. Another statute, 32 Hen. VIII, c. 13, strove\r\nto remedy this evil by enacting that no entire horse under 15 hands\r\nwas to feed on any forest, chase, waste, or common land.\r\n\r\nThis statute was a useful one, so also was 21 Hen. VIII, c. 8, which\r\nforbade for three years the killing of calves between January 1 and\r\nMay 1, under a penalty of 6s. 8d., because so many had been killed by\r\n'covetous persons' that the cattle of the country were dwindling in\r\nnumber. Others, however, were merely meddlesome, and directed against\r\nthat unpopular man the dealer. For instance, owners refusing to sell\r\ncattle at assessed prices were to answer first in the Star Chamber (25\r\nHen. VIII, c. 1); and by 3 and 4 Edw. VI, c. 19, no cattle were to be\r\nbought but in open fair or market, and not to be resold then alive,\r\nthough a man might buy cattle anywhere for his own use. No person,\r\nagain, was to resell cattle within five weeks after he bought them (5\r\nEdw. VI, c. 14); and a common drover had by the same Act to have a\r\nlicence from three justices before he could buy and sell cattle. We\r\nmay be sure that these laws were more honoured in the breach than in\r\nthe observance, as they deserved to be.\r\n\r\nHops were said to have been introduced from the Low Countries about\r\nthe middle of Henry VIII's reign; but there can be no doubt that this\r\nis a mistake. It has been mentioned that they flourished in the\r\ngardens of Edward I, and a distinguished authority[210] says the hop\r\nmay with probability be reckoned a native of Britain; but it was first\r\nused as a salad or vegetable for the table, the young sprouts having\r\nthe flavour of asparagus and coming earlier. Hasted, the historian of\r\nKent, states[211] that a petition was presented to Parliament against\r\nthe hop plant in 1428 wherein it was called a 'wicked weed'. Harrison\r\nsays, 'Hops in time past were plentiful in this land, afterwards their\r\nmaintenance did cease, and now (cir. 1580) being revived where are\r\nanie better to be found?'[212] Even then growers had to face foreign\r\ncompetition, as the customs accounts prove that considerable\r\nquantities were imported into England. In 1482 a cwt. was sold for 8s.\r\nand 1 cwt. 21 lb. for 19s. 6d., an early example of that fluctuation\r\nin price which has long characterized them.[213] Their average price\r\nabout this time seems to have been 14s. 1/2d. a cwt.\r\n\r\nDuring the Tudor period the number of day labourers increased, largely\r\nowing to the enclosures having deprived the small holder and commoner\r\nof their land and rights. But judging by the statutes those paid\r\nyearly and boarded in the farm house were still most numerous.\r\n\r\nIn 1495 the hours of labourers were first regulated by law. The\r\nstatute II Hen. VII, c. 22, says that 23 Hen. VI, c. 12,[214] was\r\ninsufficiently observed; and besides increasing wages slightly set\r\nforth the following hours for work on the farm: the labourer was to be\r\nat his work from the middle of March to the middle of September before\r\n5 a.m., and have half an hour for breakfast and an hour and a half for\r\ndinner and sleep, when sleep was allowed, that is from the middle of\r\nMay to the middle of August; when sleep was not allowed, an hour for\r\ndinner and half an hour for his nonemete or lunch; and he was to work\r\ntill between 7 and 8 p.m. During the rest of the year he was to work\r\nfrom daylight to dark. The attempt to regulate hours, which seem fair\r\nand reasonable, no doubt met with better success than that to regulate\r\nwages, for 6 Hen. VIII, c. 3 (1514), says the previous statutes had\r\nbeen very much disregarded, and sets down the rates once more:--\r\n\r\n  A bailiff's yearly wages, with diet, were to be not more\r\n    than £1 6s. 8d., and 5s. for clothes.\r\n\r\n  A chief hind, carter, or chief shepherd, with diet, not more\r\n    than £1, and 5s. for clothes.\r\n\r\n  A common servant or labourer, with diet, not more than\r\n    16s. 8d., and 4s. for clothes.\r\n\r\n  A woman servant, with diet, not more than 10s., and 4s.\r\n    for clothes.\r\n\r\nBy the day, except in harvest, a common labourer from Easter to\r\nMichaelmas was to have 2d. with food and drink, 4d. without; and from\r\nMichaelmas to Easter 1-1/2d. with food and drink, and 3d. without. In\r\nharvest:--\r\n\r\n  A mower, with food, 4d. a day; without, 6d.\r\n  A reaper, with food, 3d. a day; without, 5d.\r\n  A carter, with food, 3d.; without, 5d.\r\n  Other labourers, with food, 2-1/2d.; without, 4-1/2d.\r\n  Women, with food, 2-1/2d.; without, 4-1/2d.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[205] _Booke of Husbandry_ (ed. 1568), fol. 5.

In 1543 Henry VIII, who had given away or\r\nsquandered, in addition to the great treasure left him by his thrifty\r\nfather, all the wealth obtained from the dissolution of the\r\nmonasteries, debased the coinage in order to get more money into his\r\ninsatiable hands, and prices went up in consequence. But there were\r\nother causes: the influx of precious metals from newly discovered\r\nAmerica into Europe had commenced to make itself felt, and the\r\npopulation of the country began to grow steadily. Also, it must not be\r\nforgotten that the seasons, which in the early part of the century had\r\nbeen normal, were for the next sixty years frequently rainy and bad.\r\nIt is unnecessary to say that this must have largely helped to raise\r\nthe price of corn. The average price of wheat from 1540-1583 was 13s.\r\n10-1/2d. a quarter; from 1583-1702, 39s. 0-1/2d. Corn was still\r\nsubject to extraordinary fluctuations: in 1557, Holinshed says before\r\nharvest wheat was 53s. 4d. a quarter, malt 44s. After harvest wheat\r\nwas 5s., malt 6s. 8d., the former prices being due to a terrible\r\ndrought in England. Oxen in the period 1583-1703 were worth 75s.\r\ninstead of under £1 in the period 1400-1540. Wool was from 9d. to 1s.\r\na lb. instead of about 3-1/2d., and all other farm products increased\r\nwith these.[215] Hops were from 1540-1582 about 26s. 8d. a cwt., and\r\nfrom 1583-1700, 82s. 9-1/2d. In 1574 Reynold Scott published the first\r\nEnglish treatise on hops,[216] in which he says, 'one man may well\r\nkeep 2,000 hils, upon every hil well ordered you shall have 3 lb. of\r\nhoppes at the least, one hundred pounds of these hoppes are commonly\r\nworth 26s. 8d., one acre of ground and the third part of one man's\r\nlabour with small cost beside, shall yield unto him that ordereth the\r\nsame well, fortie marks yearly and that for ever,' an optimistic\r\nestimate that many growers to-day would like to see realized. 'In the\r\npreparation of a hop garden', says the same writer, 'if your ground be\r\ngrasse, it should be first sowen with hempe or beanes which maketh the\r\nground melowe, destroyeth weedes, and leaveth the same in good season\r\nfor this purpose.[217] At the end of Marche, repayre to some good\r\ngarden to compound with the owner for choice rootes, which in some\r\nplaces will cost 5d. an hundredth. And now you must choose the biggest\r\nrootes you can find, such as are three or four inches about, and let\r\nevery root be nine or ten inches long, and contain three joints.'\r\nHoles were then to be dug at least 8 feet apart, one foot square, and\r\none foot deep, and in each two or three roots planted and well hilled\r\nup. Tusser, however, recommended them much closer:\r\n\r\n     'Five foot from another each hillock should stand,\r\n     As straight as a levelled line with the hand.\r\n     Let every hillock be four foot wide.\r\n     Three poles to a hillock, I pas not how long,\r\n     Shall yield the more profit set deeplie and strong.'\r\n\r\nThree or four poles were to be set to each hill 15 or 16 feet long,\r\nunless the ground was very rich, the poles 9 or 10 inches in\r\ncircumference at the butt, so as to last longer and stand the wind\r\nwell. After they were put up, the ground round the poles was to be\r\nwell rammed. Rushes or grass were used for tieing the hops. During\r\nthe growth of the hops, not more than two or three bines were to be\r\nallowed to each pole; and after the first year the hills were to be\r\ngradually raised from the alleys between the rows until, according to\r\nthe illustrations in Scott's book, they were 3 or 4 feet high, the\r\n'greater you make your hylles the more hoppes you shall have upon\r\nyour poals'. When the time for picking came, the bines when cut were\r\ncarried to a 'floore prepared for the purpose', apparently of\r\nhardened earth, where they were stripped into baskets, and Scott\r\nthought that 'it is not hurtfull greatly though the smaller leaves be\r\nmingled with the hoppes'. In wet weather the hops were to be stripped\r\nin the house. The fire for drying hops was of wood, and some dried\r\ntheir hops in the sun, both processes to us appearing very risky; as\r\nthe first would be too quick, and the latter next to impossible in\r\nSeptember in England. They were sometimes packed in barrels, as\r\nTusser tells us, 'Some close them up drie in a hogshead or vat, yet\r\ncanvas or sontage (coarse cloth) is better than that.'\r\n\r\nBy this time England had largely changed from a corn-growing to a\r\nstock-raising country; Harrison, writing in the middle of Queen\r\nElizabeth's reign, says, 'the soile of Britaine is more inclined\r\nto feeding and grazing than profitable for tillage and bearing of\r\ncorne ... and such store is there of cattle in everie place that the\r\nfourth part of the land is scarcely manured for the provision of\r\ngraine.' But this statement seems exaggerated. We know that by\r\nHarrison's time enclosures had affected but a small area, and the\r\ngreater part of the cultivated land was in open arable fields. The\r\nyield of corn was now much greater than in the Middle Ages; rye or\r\nwheat well tilled and dressed now produced 15 to 20 bushels to the\r\nacre instead of 6 or 8, barley 36 bushels, oats 4 or 5 quarters[218],\r\nthough in the north, which was still greatly behind the rest of\r\nEngland, crops were smaller. No doubt this was partly due to the\r\nmuch-abused enclosures: the industrious farmer could now do what he\r\nliked with his own, without hindrance from his lazy or unskilful\r\nneighbour. Tusser's preference for the 'several' field is very\r\ndecided; comparing it with the 'champion' or common field he says:--\r\n\r\n     The countrie inclosed I praise\r\n     the tother delighteth me not,\r\n     There swineherd that keepeth the hog\r\n     there neetherd with cur and his horne,\r\n     There shepherd with whistle and dog\r\n     be fence to the medowe and corne,\r\n     There horse being tide on a balke\r\n     is readie with theefe for to walke,\r\n     Where all things in common doth reste\r\n     corne field with the pasture and meade,\r\n     Tho' common ye do for the best\r\n     yet what doth it stand ye in steade?\r\n     More plentie of mutton and beefe\r\n     corne butter and cheese of the best\r\n     More wealth any where (to be briefe)\r\n     more people, more handsome and prest (neat.)\r\n     Where find ye? (go search any coaste)\r\n     than there where enclosure is most.\r\n     More work for the labouring man\r\n     as well in the towne as the fielde.\r\n     For commons these commoners crie\r\n     inclosing they may not abide,\r\n     Yet some be not able to bie\r\n     a cow with her calf by her side.\r\n     Nor laie (intend) not to live by their wurke,\r\n     But thievishly loiter and lurke.\r\n     What footpaths are made and how brode\r\n     Annoiance too much to be borne,\r\n     With horse and with cattle what rode\r\n     is made thorowe erie man's come.\r\n\r\nBut the rich graziers boasted that they did not grow corn because\r\nthey could buy it cheaper in the market; and they are said to have\r\ntraded on the necessity of the poor farmer to sell at Michaelmas in\r\norder to pay his rent, and when they had got the corn into their\r\nhands they raised the price. The corn-dealers of the time were looked\r\nupon with dislike by every one; many of the dearths then so frequent,\r\nand nearly always caused by bad seasons, were ascribed to 'engrossers\r\nbuying of corn and witholding it for sale'. By a statute of 1552 the\r\nfreedom of internal corn trade was entirely suppressed, and no one\r\ncould carry corn from one part of England to another without a\r\nlicence, and any one who bought corn to sell it again was liable to\r\ntwo months' imprisonment and forfeited his corn. Although we shall\r\nsee that this policy was reversed in the next century, the feeling\r\nagainst corn-dealers survived for many years and was loudly\r\nexpressed during the Napoleonic war; indeed, we may doubt if it\r\nis extinct to-day.\r\n\r\nMany of the fruits and garden produce, which had been neglected since\r\nthe first Edward, had by now come into use again, 'not onlie among the\r\npoor commons, I meane of melons, pompions, gourds, cucumbers,\r\nradishes, skirets (probably a sort of carrot), parsneps, carrots,\r\ncabbages, navewes (turnip radishes (?)), turnips,[219] and all kinds\r\nof salad herbes, but also at the tables of delicate merchants,\r\ngentlemen, and the nobilitie.'[220]\r\n\r\n'Also we have most delicate apples, plummes, pears, walnuts, filberts,\r\n&c., and those of sundrie sorts, planted within fortie years past, in\r\ncomparison of which most of the old trees are nothing worth: so have\r\nwe no less store of strange fruite, as abricotes, almonds, peaches,\r\nfigges, cornetrees (probably cornels) in noblemen's orchards. I have\r\nseen capers, orenges, and lemmons, and heard of wild olives growing\r\nhere, besides other strange trees.'[221]\r\n\r\nAs a proof of the growth of grass in proportion to tillage between\r\nthe fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, Eden gives several\r\nexamples,[222] of which the following are significant:--\r\n\r\n                                           Arable.

In 1517\r\na commission of inquiry instigated by Wolsey held inquisition on\r\nenclosures and the decay of tillage, and it seems to have been the\r\nonly honest effort to stop the evil. It was to inquire what decays,\r\nconversions, and park enclosures had been made since 1489, but the\r\nresult even of this attempt was small. In 1535 a fresh statute, 27\r\nHen. VIII, c. 22, stated that the Act limiting the number of sheep to\r\nbe kept had only been observed on lands held of the king, whereon many\r\nhouses had been rebuilt and much pasture reconverted to tillage; but\r\non lands holden of other lords this was not the case, therefore the\r\nking was to have the moiety of the profits of such lands as had been\r\nconverted from tillage to pasture since 4 Hen. VII until a proper\r\nhouse was built and the land returned to tillage; but the Act only\r\napplied to fourteen counties therein enumerated. The enclosing for\r\nsheep-runs still went on, however, often with ruthless selfishness;\r\nhouses and townships were levelled, says Sir Thomas More, and nothing\r\nleft standing except the church, which was turned into a sheep-house:\r\n\r\n     'The towns go down, the land decays,\r\n     Of corn-fields plain lays,\r\n     Great men maketh nowadays\r\n     A sheepcot of the church',\r\n\r\nsaid a contemporary ballad.\r\n\r\nLatimer wrote, 'where there were a great many householders and\r\ninhabitants there is now but a shepherd and his dog.' 'I am sorie to\r\nreport it,' says Harrison,[224] 'but most sorrowful of all to\r\nunderstand that men of great port and countenance are so far from\r\nsuffering their farmers to have anie gaine at all that they themselves\r\nbecome graziers, butchers, tanners, sheepmasters, and woodmen, thereby\r\nto enrich themselves.' The Act against pulling down farmhouses was\r\nevaded by repairing one room for the use of a shepherd; a single\r\nfurrow was driven across a field to prove it was still under the\r\nplough; to avoid holding illegal numbers of sheep flocks were held in\r\nthe names of sons and servants.[225] The country swarmed with heaps of\r\nmiserable paupers, 'sturdy and valiant' beggars, and thieves who,\r\nthough hanged twenty at a time on a single gallows, still infested all\r\nthe countryside, their numbers being swollen by the dissolution of the\r\nmonasteries and the breaking up of the bands of retainers kept by the\r\ngreat nobles.\r\n\r\nRents also were rising rapidly. Latimer's account of his father's farm\r\nis too well known to be again quoted; his opinions were shared by all\r\nthe writers of the day. Sir William Forrest, about 1540, says that\r\nlandlords now demand fourfold rents, so that the farmer has to raise\r\nhis prices in proportion, and beef and mutton were so dear that a poor\r\nman could not 'bye a morsell'. 'Howe joyne they lordshyp to\r\nlordshyppe, manner to manner, ferme to ferme. How do the rych men, and\r\nespecially such as be shepemongers, oppresse the king's people by\r\ndevourynge their common pastures with the shepe so that the poore are\r\nnot able to keepe a cowe, but are like to starve. And yet when was\r\nbeef ever so dere or mutton, wool now 8s. a stone.\r\n\r\n'Now', says another, later in the century, 'I can never get a horse\r\nshoed under 10d. or 12d., when I have also seen the common pryce was\r\n6d. And cannot your neighbour remember that within these thirty years\r\nI could bye the best pigge or goose that I could lay my hand on for\r\nfour pence which now costeth 12d., a good capon for 3d. or 4d., a hen\r\nfor 2d., which now costeth me double and triple.'[226]\r\n\r\nParliament, of course, tried to regulate the price of food; an Act of\r\n1532, 24 Hen. VIII, c. 3, ordained that beef and pork should be 1/2d.\r\na lb. and mutton and veal 5/8d. a lb. The decrease in the number of\r\ncows also received its attention; 2 and 3 Philip and Mary, c. 3,\r\nstates that forasmuch of late years a great number of persons have fed\r\nin their pastures sheep and cattle with no regard to breeding, so that\r\nthere was great scarcity of stock, therefore for every 60 sheep kept\r\none milk cow shall be kept, and for every 120 sheep one calf shall be\r\nbred, and for every 10 head of horned cattle shall be kept one milk\r\ncow, and for every two cows so kept one calf shall be bred. The Act\r\nwas to last seven years, but 13 Eliz. c. 25 made it perpetual.\r\n\r\nIn 1549 came the rising of Robert Kett in Norfolk, the last attempt of\r\nthe English labourer to obtain redress of his wrongs by force of arms,\r\nthough Kett himself belonged to the landlord class and took the side\r\nof the people probably by accident. The petition of grievances drawn\r\nup by his followers aimed at diminishing the power of lords of manors\r\nas regards enclosures, the keeping of dove-cots, and other feudal\r\nwrongs. 'We pray', said the insurgents, 'that all bondmen may be made\r\nfree, for God made all free with His precious blood-shedding.' The\r\nrebellion came to nothing, and some of the abuses at which it was\r\naimed were dying a natural death, though enclosure often acted hardly\r\non the poor man.\r\n\r\nThe manorial system went on steadily decaying, and by this time the\r\ndemesne lands had much diminished in area on most manors. Many parcels\r\nhad been sold to the new landlord class, who had made their fortunes\r\nin the towns and, like most Englishmen, desired to become country\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\nMuch of the demesne had been sold in small lots to well-off tradesmen,\r\nand as the villeins had become copyholders a large part of the land\r\nwas owned or occupied by yeomen or tenant farmers, who cultivated from\r\n20 to 150 acres. Many of the labourers also owned or rented cottages\r\nwith 4 or 5 acres attached to them. Such was the rural society at the\r\nend of the Tudor period. The progress of enclosures helped to destroy\r\nthis, for the labourers gradually ceased to own or occupy land, farms\r\nincreased in size, the ownership of land came to be more and more the\r\nprivilege of the rich, and people flocked in increasing numbers to the\r\ntowns.[227a] In five Norfolk manors in Elizabeth's time only from\r\none-seventh to one-tenth was in demesne, and little of what was left\r\nwas farmed by the lord, but let to farmers on leases.[227b] On some\r\nmanors the demesne land lay in compact blocks near the manor house; on\r\nothers it was in scattered strips of various size; in others it lay in\r\nblocks and strips. The following particulars of a manor in Norfolk\r\ngive a good picture of an estate in 1586-8, the tenants on it, their\r\nrank, and the size of their holdings:--\r\n\r\n  Horstead with Staninghall, 2,746 acres.\r\n\r\n  The tenants with messuages in the village were:--\r\n\r\n                               Acres.\r\n\r\n   1. J. Topliffe, gentleman     280\r\n   2. F. Woodhouse, Esquire      270\r\n   3. R. Ward, gentleman         265\r\n   4. H. Shreve                  180\r\n   5. A. Pightling, widow        120\r\n   6. W. Rose's heirs            110\r\n   7. G. Berde                    60\r\n   8. A. Thetford, gentleman      60\r\n   9. T. Pightling                60\r\n  10. R. Pightling                60\r\n  11. J. Rose                     40\r\n  12. R. Lincoln                  40\r\n  13. W. Jeckell                  20\r\n  14. W. Bulwer                   20\r\n  15. E. Newerby, gentleman       15\r\n  16. T. Barnard                  12\r\n  17. E. Sparke                   10\r\n\r\nThere were also 12 tenants without houses, holding from 1 to 20\r\nacres; the demesne was 230 acres; there were two glebes containing 84\r\nacres, and town lands of 7 acres. The waste amounted to 350 acres,\r\nwhich by 1599 had all disappeared.\r\n\r\nOn this manor the houses were not collected together in a village as\r\nusual in most parts of England, but scattered about the estate. In\r\ntwo other manors the amount of waste remaining at this period was\r\nvery small, but in three others little had been 'approved' and much\r\nconsequently remained; most of the 'approvements', where made, seem\r\nto have been of long standing, and all the enclosures made were for\r\ntillage, not for grass as we should expect. The 350 acres of waste\r\nthat remained at Horstead in 1586-8 was enclosed in 1599 by agreement\r\nbetween the lords of the manor and the tenants on the following\r\nterms:--\r\n\r\n  1. Lords to take 80 acres in severalty.\r\n\r\n  2. Lords to reserve all rights to treasure trove, minerals,\r\n     waifs, &c., with right of entry to take the same.\r\n\r\n  3. All rights of pasture, shack, and foldage were to be\r\n     extinguished on all lands in the village.\r\n\r\n  4. The tenants were to pay an annual quit rent of £7 14s. 5d.\r\n     for their shares of the common.\r\n\r\nBefore a man enclosed he consolidated his holding by exchange, so as\r\nto bring it into a compact parcel instead of scattered strips, a very\r\nlengthy process; then he ploughed up the bounds between the strips;\r\nafter which he changed the direction of the ploughing, ploughing the\r\nland crossways, a very necessary change, as it had all been ploughed\r\nlengthways for centuries; and lastly he erected his fences: the\r\nbounds of the strips, however, were sometimes left to show which were\r\nfreehold and which copyhold. On the other hand, there were exceptions\r\nto the curtailment of the demesne: on an Oxfordshire manor of the\r\nsixteenth century the greater part of the 64 yard-lands of which it\r\nconsisted had by then passed from the possession of the peasants to\r\nthe private use of the lord of the manor.[228] To each yard-land\r\nbelonged a house and farmyard, 24 to 28-3/4 acres of arable land, a\r\nshare in the commonable meadows which for each occupier came to some 8\r\nacres, also the right to turn out 8 oxen or cows, or 6 horses and 40\r\nsheep on to the common pasture. Probably, as in other manors in\r\nancient times, each occupier had a right to as much firewood as was\r\nnecessary, and timber for building purposes and fences. The arable\r\nland lay in numerous small plots of half an acre each and less,\r\nmingled together in a state of great confusion, and was farmed on the\r\nfour-field system--wheat, beans, oats, fallow--though 200 years before\r\nthe three-field system had been most common in the district. Many of\r\nthe common arable fields evidently often contained, in those days of\r\npoor cultivation and inefficient drainage, patches of boggy and poor\r\nland which were left uncultivated.[229] In the rolls of the Manor of\r\nScotter in Lincolnshire, in the early part of the sixteenth century,\r\nno one was to allow his horses to depasture in the arable fields\r\nunless they were tethered on these bad spots to prevent them wandering\r\ninto the growing corn.[230] Many of the other regulations of this\r\nmanor throw a flood of light on the farming of the day. In 1557 it was\r\nordered that no man should drive his cattle unyoked through the\r\ncorn-field under a penalty of 3s. 4d. Every man shall keep a\r\nsufficient fence against his neighbour under the same penalty. No man\r\nshall make a footpath over the corn-field, the penalty for so doing\r\nbeing 4d. Every one shall both ring and yoke their swine before S.\r\nEllen's Day (probably May 3), under a penalty of 6s. 8d., the custom\r\nof yoking swine to prevent them breaking fences being common until\r\nrecent times. It was the custom in some manors to sow peas in a plot\r\nespecially set apart for the poor. Another rule was that no one should\r\nbake or brew by night for fear of burning down the flimsy houses and\r\nbuildings. The penalty for ploughing up the balks which divided the\r\nstrips, or meere (marc) furrows as they were called in Lincolnshire,\r\nwas 2d., a very light one for so serious an offence. In 1565 a penalty\r\nof 10s. was imposed on Thomas Dawson for breaking his hemp, i.e.\r\nseparating the fibre from the bark in his large open chimney on winter\r\nnights, a habit which the manor courts severely punished owing to the\r\nrisk of fire, for hemp refuse is very inflammable. It 1578 it was laid\r\ndown that every one was to sow the outside portion of their arable\r\nlands, and not leave it waste for weeds to the damage of his\r\nneighbours; and that those who were too poor to keep sheep should not\r\ngather wool before 8 o'clock in the morning, in reference to the\r\ncustom of allowing the poor to pick refuse wool found on bushes and\r\nthorns, and this rule was to prevent them tearing wool from the sheep\r\nat night under that pretext. No man was to keep any beasts apart from\r\nthe herdsman, for if the herdsman did not know the animals he could\r\nnot tell them from strays. Every one was to sweep their chimney four\r\ntimes a year, for fear of sparks falling on the thatch. No man was to\r\nsuffer the nests of crows or magpies in his ground, but pull them down\r\nbefore May Day. In the meadows, before each man began to mow his grass\r\nhe was to mark the exact limits of his own land with 'wadsticks' or\r\ntall rods, so that there could be no mistake as to boundaries. The\r\nhealth of the community and of the live stock also received attention:\r\nin 1583 one Pattynson was fined 1s. for allowing a 'scabbed' horse to\r\ngo on the common; dead cattle were to be buried the day after death,\r\nand all unwholesome meat was to be buried.\r\n\r\nHarrison praises the farmer of his day highly: 'the soyle is even now\r\nin these oure dayes growne to be much more fruitfulle; the cause is\r\nthat our country men are grown more skilful and careful throwe\r\nrecompense of gayne.' He was also doing well by means of his skill and\r\ncare; and in spite of the raising of rents by the much-abused\r\nlandlords; for in former times 'for all their frugality they were\r\nscarcely able to live and pay their rents on rent day without selling\r\na cow or a horse'. Such also used to be their poverty, that if a\r\nfarmer went to the alehouse, 'a thing greatly used in those days,' and\r\nthere, 'in a braverie to show what store he had, did caste downe his\r\npurse and therein a noble or 6 shillings in silver unto them, it was\r\nvery likely that all the rest could not lay downe so much against it.'\r\nAnd In Henry's time, though rents of £4 had increased to £40, £50, or\r\n£100, yet the farmer generally had at the end of his term saved six or\r\nseven years' rent, besides a 'fair garnish of pewter on his cupboard',\r\nand odd vessels, also 'three or four feather beds, so manie coverlids\r\nand carpets of tapestry, a silver salt, a bowle for wine, and a dozzen\r\nof spoones to furnish up the sute'. His food consisted principally of\r\nbeef, and 'such food as the butcher selleth', mutton, veal, lamb,\r\npork, besides souse, brawn, bacon, fruit, fruit pies, cheese, butter,\r\nand eggs.[231] In feasting, the husbandman or farmer exceeded,\r\nespecially at bridals, purifications of women, and such other\r\nmeetings, where 'it is incredible to tell what meat is consumed and\r\nspent'. But, besides these, there were many poorer farmers who lived\r\nat home 'with hard and pinching diet'. Wheaten bread was at this time\r\na luxury confined to the gentility, the farmer's loaf, according to\r\nTusser, was sometimes wheat, sometimes rye, sometimes mastlin, a\r\nmixture of wheat and rye, though the poorer farmer on uninclosed land\r\nate bread made of beans.\r\n\r\nThe poor ate bread of rye or barley, and in time of dearth of beans,\r\npeas, and oats, and sometimes acorns.[232] According to Tusser, the\r\nlabourer was allowed roast meat twice a week,\r\n\r\n     'Good plowmen looke weekly of custom and right,\r\n     For roast meate on Sundaies, and Thursdaies at night';\r\n\r\nand Latimer calls bacon 'the necessary meate' of the labourer, and it\r\nseems to have been his great stand-by then as now. The bread and bacon\r\nwere supplemented largely by milk and porridge.[233] The statute, 24\r\nHen. VIII, c. 3, says that all food, and especially beef, mutton,\r\npork, and veal, 'which is the common feeding of mean and poor\r\npersons.' was too dear for them to buy, and fixed the price of beef\r\nand pork at 1/2d. a lb. and of mutton and veal at 5/8d. a lb.; but the\r\nstatute, like others of the kind, was of little avail, and the price\r\nof beef was in the middle of the sixteenth century about 1d. a lb. or\r\n8d. in our money. As the average price of wheat at the same date was\r\n14s. a quarter, or about 112s. in our money, fresh meat was\r\ncomparatively much cheaper, and it is no wonder that even the farmer\r\ncould not afford wheaten bread regularly. Moryson, writing in\r\nElizabeth's reign, says 'Englishmen eate barley and rye brown bread,\r\nand prefer it to white as abiding longer in the stomeck and not so\r\nsoon digested'.[234]\r\n\r\nA tithe dispute at North Luffenham in Rutlandshire throws considerable\r\nlight on the financial position of the various classes interested in\r\nthe land about 1576. At the trial several witnesses were examined, who\r\nall made statements as to the amount of their worldly wealth, and it\r\nis a noteworthy fact that even the humblest had saved something;\r\nperhaps because there was no poor law or State pension fund to\r\ndiscourage thrift.[235] Thomas Blackburne, a husbandman, who had\r\nserved his master as 'chief baylie of his husbandrie', had at the end\r\nof a long life saved £40. Another, William Walker, eighty years of\r\nage, during forty years of service to Mr. John Wymarke had put by £10.\r\nRobert Sculthorp, who had at one time been a farmer, was worth £26 6s.\r\n8d., but the size of his farm is unfortunately not told us. Roland\r\nWymarke, a gentleman farmer, who had farmed for forty years at North\r\nLuffenham, was little better off than Thomas Blackburne, the baylie,\r\nfor he estimated his capital at £50. £50, however, must not be taken\r\nas representing the average wealth of a 'gentleman', though a few\r\nhundred pounds was then considered a considerable fortune. In 1577\r\nThomas Corny, a prosperous landlord at Bassingthorpe, Lincolnshire,\r\nhad a house with a hall, three parlours, seven chambers, a high\r\ngarret, maid's garret, five chambers for yeomen hinds, shepherd, &c.,\r\ntwo kitchens, two larders, milk-house, brew-house, buttery, and\r\ncellar; and it was furnished with tables, carpets, cushions, pictures,\r\nbeds, curtains, chairs, chests, and numerous kitchen and other\r\nutensils, besides a quantity of plate, which was then looked upon not\r\nonly as a useful luxury but as a safe form of investment. The small\r\nsquire was not nearly so well off as this. In 1527 the house of John\r\nAsfordby, who was of that degree, contained a hall, parlour, small\r\nparlour, low parlour, a chamber over the parlour, gallery chamber,\r\nbuttery, and kitchen, and furniture was scanty, but the plate cupboard\r\nwas well filled.[236] A prosperous yeoman was often comparatively\r\nbetter off than the small squire. Richard Cust, of Pinchbeck in the\r\nsame county, though his house was small, consisting only of a hall,\r\nparlour with chamber over, kitchen with chamber over, brew-house,\r\nmilne-house (mill-house), and milk-house, was richer in furniture,\r\npossessing a folding-table, 4 chairs, 6 cushions, 27 pieces of pewter,\r\n10 candlesticks, 4 basins, 1 laver, 6 beds, and other articles.[237]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[215] See table at end, and Thorold Rogers's prices in Vol. V. of his\r\ngreat work.\r\n\r\n[216] 'A perfite platforme of a Hoppegarden', in _Arte of Gardening_,\r\nby R.

THE ASSESSMENT OF WAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cattle and sheep of this period have generally been described as\r\npoor animals, and no doubt they would seem small to us. To Jacob\r\nRathgib, a traveller, writing in 1592, they seemed worthy of praise:\r\n'England has beautiful oxen and cows, with very large horns, low and\r\nheavy and for the most part black; there is abundance of sheep and\r\nwethers, which graze by themselves winter and summer without\r\nshepherds.' The heaviest wethers, according to him, weighed 60 lb. and\r\nhad at the most 6 lb. of wool, a much heavier fleece than is generally\r\nascribed to them; others had 4 or 5 lb. Horses were abundant, and,\r\nthough low and small, were very fleet; the riding horses being\r\ngeldings and generally excellent. Immense numbers of swine were in the\r\ncountry, 'larger than in any other.' Six years later another\r\ntraveller, Hentzner, noticed that the soil abounded with cattle, and\r\nthe inhabitants were more inclined to feeding than ploughing. He saw,\r\ntoo, a Berkshire harvest-home: 'As we were returning to our inn (at\r\nWindsor) we happened to meet some country people celebrating their\r\nharvest-home, their last load of corn they crown with flowers, having\r\nbesides an image richly dressed by which perhaps they would signify\r\nCeres; this they keep moving about, while men and women, men and\r\nmaid-servants, riding through the streets in the cart, shout as loud\r\nas they can till they arrive at the barn.' Harrison[238] tells us, no\r\ndoubt with patriotic bias, that 'our oxen are such as the like are not\r\nto be found in any country of Europe both for greatness of body and\r\nsweetness of flesh, their horns a yard between the tips.' Cows had\r\ndoubled in price in his time, from 26s. 8d. to 53s. 4d. 'Our horses\r\nare high, but not of such huge greatness as in other places,' yet\r\nremarkable for the easiness of their pace; and 5 or 6 cart-horses will\r\ndraw 30 cwt. a long journey, and a pack-horse will carry 4 cwt.\r\nwithout any hurt,--a statement which is one more proof of the poorness\r\nof the roads. The chief horse fairs were at 'Ripon, Newportpond,\r\nWolfpit, and Harborow,' where horse dealers were as great rogues as\r\never. Pigeons were still the curse of the farmer, and their cotes were\r\ncalled dens of thieves.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the sixteenth century, certainly by the first quarter of\r\nthe seventeenth, the villein, who in the Middle Ages had formed the\r\nbulk of the population, had disappeared.[239] It is probable that even\r\nat the beginning of the Tudor period the great majority of the bondmen\r\nhad become free, and that the serf then only formed one per cent. of\r\nthe population, and many of those had left the country and become\r\nartizans in the towns, for personal serfdom had outlasted demesne\r\nfarming; though even there the heavy hand of the lord was upon them\r\nand enforced the ancient customs.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century flax was apparently grown upon most farms,\r\nthe statutes 34 Hen. VIII, c. 4, and 5 Eliz., c. 5, obliging every\r\nperson occupying 60 acres of tillage to have a quarter of an acre in\r\nflax or hemp, and Moryson says the husbandmen wore garments of coarse\r\ncloth made at home, so did their wives, and 'in generall' their linen\r\nwas coarse and made at home.[240]\r\n\r\n     'Good flax and good hemp to have of her own\r\n     In Maie a good housewife will see it be sowne',\r\n\r\nsings Tusser. The statute of Henry VIII enjoined the sowing of flax\r\nand hemp because of the great increase of idle people in the realm, to\r\nwhich the numerous imports, especially linen cloth, contributed.\r\n\r\nSaffron also was much grown, that at Saffron Walden in Essex was said\r\nto be the best in the world, the profit from it being reckoned at £13\r\nan acre. Its virtues were innumerable, if we may believe the\r\ncontemporary writers; it flavoured dishes, helped digestion, was good\r\nfor short wind, killed moths, helped deafness, dissolved gravel, and,\r\nlastly, 'drunk in wine doth haste on drunkenesse.'\r\n\r\nThe most important novelty of this century was the potato, which the\r\ncolonists, sent out in 1586 by Sir Walter Raleigh, brought from\r\nVirginia to Ireland, though it had been introduced into Europe by the\r\nSpaniards before this. According to Gerard, the old English botanist,\r\nit was, on its first introduction from America, only cultivated in the\r\ngardens of the nobility and gentry as a curious exotic; and in 1606 it\r\noccurs among the vegetables considered necessary for a nobleman's\r\nhousehold.[241] It is curious to find Gerard comparing it to what he\r\ncalls the 'common potato', in reality the sweet potato brought to\r\nEngland by Drake and Hawkins earlier in the century. In James I's\r\nreign the root was considered a great delicacy, and was sold to the\r\nqueen's household at 2s. a lb., an enormous price.\r\n\r\nLike most agricultural novelties it spread very slowly, but about the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century began to be planted out in the\r\nfields in small patches in Lancashire, whence it spread all over the\r\nkingdom and to France.[242] At this date it was looked upon as a very\r\nsecond-rate article of food, if we may judge by the _Spectator_ (No.\r\n232), which alludes to it as the diet of beggars. About 1690, Houghton\r\nsays, 'now they begin to spread all the kingdom over,' and recommends\r\nthem boiled or roasted and eaten with butter and sugar.[243] Eden\r\nnotes its increasing popularity during the eighteenth century, and by\r\nhis time (the end of that century) in many parts it was the staple\r\narticle of food for the poor; in Somerset the children mainly\r\nsubsisted on it, and in Devon it was made into bread. Its cultivation\r\non a large scale in the field did not, however, spread all over\r\nEngland till the Napoleonic war, and the ignorance and prejudice\r\nagainst it lasted for long; even Cobbett called it 'the lazy root,'\r\nand whole potatoes were used for seed regardless of the number of\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nIn 1563 was passed the famous Act, 5 Eliz., c. 4, which Thorold Rogers\r\nhas asserted to be the commencement of a conspiracy for cheating the\r\nEnglish workman of his wages, to tie him to the soil, to deprive him\r\nof hope, and to degrade him into irremediable poverty.[244] The\r\nviolence of this language is a prima facie reason for doubting the\r\ncorrectness of his assertion, which on examination is found to be\r\ngrossly exaggerated. Under Richard II the justices were authorized to\r\nfix the rate of wages, provided they did not exceed the maximum fixed\r\nby Parliament. The Elizabethan statute abolished the maximum and left\r\nthe justices to fix reasonable rates. So far from being an attempt to\r\nkeep wages down it seems to have been an honest effort to regulate\r\nthem according to prices,[245] whereas most previous statutes had\r\nmerely reduced wages. The preamble of the Act states this clearly\r\nenough, saying that the existing laws with regard to the hiring and\r\nwages of servants were insufficient; chiefly because the wages 'are in\r\ndyvers places to small and not answerable to this time respecting the\r\nadvancement of prices in all things that belong to the said servants\r\nand labourers, the said lawes cannot conveniently without the great\r\ngreefe and burden of the poore labourer and hired man be put in due\r\nexecution.' But as several of these Acts were still beneficial it was\r\nproposed to consolidate them into one statute in order to banish\r\nidleness, advance husbandry, and give the labourer decent wages. It\r\nwas enacted therefore that all persons between the ages of twelve\r\nyears and sixty, not being otherwise occupied, 'nor being a gentleman\r\nborn, nor having lands of the yearly value of 40s., nor goods to the\r\nvalue of £10,' should be compellable to serve in husbandry with 'any\r\nperson that keepeth husbandry' by the year, and the hours of work were\r\nre-enacted.\r\n\r\nThe rates of wages of artificers, husbandmen, &c., were to be\r\nascertained yearly by the justices and the sheriff, 'if he\r\nconveniently may,' at quarter sessions, 'calling unto them such\r\ndiscrete and grave persons as they shall thinck meete and conferring\r\ntogether respecting the plentie or scarcitie of the tyme and other\r\ncircumstances necessary to be considered,' and the wages fixed were to\r\nbe certified into Chancery. Then proclamations of the wages thus\r\ndetermined were to be made in the cities and market towns. Every\r\nperson who gave higher wages than those established by the\r\nproclamation was to be imprisoned for ten days and fined £5, every\r\nreceiver to be imprisoned twenty-one days. The importance still\r\nattached to the harvest season is shown by the section that all\r\nartificers and others were compellable to work in harvest or be put in\r\nthe stocks two days and a night. For the better advancement of\r\nhusbandry and tillage every householder farming 60 acres of tillage or\r\nmore might receive an apprentice in husbandry, but no tradesman or\r\nmerchant might take an apprentice save his own son, unless his parents\r\nhad freehold of the annual value of 40s.; and no person was to use\r\n'any art mistery or manual occupation now in use' unless he had served\r\nseven years' apprenticeship to it. There can be no doubt that the\r\nclauses last quoted confined a large portion of the population to\r\nagricultural work, but as we know that the people were deserting the\r\ncountry and flocking to the towns, this must have seemed to the\r\nframers of the law very desirable.\r\n\r\nThis method of fixing wages was in force until 1814, and its repeal\r\nthen was entirely contrary to the opinion of the artizan class; but it\r\nmay be doubted if the magistrates extensively used the powers given\r\nthem by the Act, and wages seem to have been settled generally by\r\ncompetition. Several instances remain, however, of wages drawn up\r\nunder this Act. Almost immediately after it was passed, in June 1564,\r\nthe Rutland magistrates met under the Act, and stated that the prices\r\nof linen, woollen, leather, corn, and other victuals were great, so\r\nthey drew up the following list of wages[246]:--\r\n\r\n  A bailiff in husbandry, having charge of two plough lands,\r\n    at least should have by the year 40s., and 8s.\r\n    for his livery.\r\n\r\n  A chief servant in husbandry, which can eire (plough), sow,\r\n    mow, thresh, make a rick, thatch and hedge, and can kill\r\n    and dress a hog, sheep, and calf, by the year 40s., and 6s.\r\n    for his livery.\r\n\r\n  A common servant in husbandry, which can mow, sow, thresh,\r\n    and load a cart, and cannot expertly make a rick, hedge, and\r\n    thatch, and cannot kill and dress a hog, sheep, or calf, by\r\n    the year 33s. 4d., and 5s. for his livery.\r\n\r\n  A mean servant in husbandry, which can drive the plough, pitch\r\n    The cart, and thresh, and cannot expertly sow, mow, thresh,\r\n    and load a cart, nor make a rick, nor thatch, by the year 24s.,\r\n    and 5s. for his livery.\r\n\r\nThe chief shepherd is only to receive 20s. and 5s. for his livery; but\r\nthis must be an error, as in the statutes 6 Hen. VIII, c. 3, and 23\r\nHen. VI, c. 12, he was placed next the bailiff as we should expect.\r\n\r\nThese wages were evidently 'with diet', and show a considerable\r\nadvance on those fixed by 6 Hen. VIII, c. 3.[247] By the day the\r\nordinary labourer was to have 6d. in winter, 7d. in summer, and 8d. to\r\n10d. in harvest time, 'finding himself.' A mower with meat earned 5d.,\r\nwithout meat 10d. a day; a man reaper with meat 4d., without 8d.; a\r\nwoman reaper 3d., and 6d.\r\n\r\nAs the price of corn and meat was three times what it had been in the\r\nfifteenth century, and the labourers' wages, taking into consideration\r\nhis harvest pay, not quite double, the Rutland magistrates hardly\r\nobserved the spirit of the Act. Rutland, moreover, judging by the\r\nassessments of the time, was a county where agriculture was very\r\nflourishing; and thirty years after we find in Yorkshire that the\r\nwinter wages of the labourer were 4d. and the summer 5d. a day: that\r\nis, he had little more wages than in the fifteenth century, with\r\nprovisions risen threefold. At Chester at the same date his day's\r\nwages were to be 4d. all the year round.[248] In 1610 the Rutland\r\nmagistrates at Oakham[249] decreed that an ordinary labourer was to\r\nhave 6d. a day in winter and 7d. in summer, the same wages as in 1564,\r\nyet wheat in that year averaged 32s. 7d. a quarter. A bailiff by the\r\nyear was now advanced to 52s., a manservant of the best sort, equal no\r\ndoubt to the chief servant in husbandry, to 50s., a 'common servant'\r\nto 40s., and a 'mean servant' to 29s., but all without livery. At\r\nChelmsford, in 1651, there was a very different rate fixed, the\r\nordinary labourer getting from 1s. to 1s. 2d. a day; but this seems to\r\nhave been exceptional, as at Warwick in 1684 he was only to have 8d.,\r\nand as late as 1725 in Lancashire 9d. to 10d. a day.[250] In 1682, by\r\nthe Bury St. Edmunds assessment, a common labourer got 10d. a day in\r\nwinter and 1s. in summer, and a reaper in harvest 1s. 8d. By the year\r\na bailiff was paid £6, a carter £5, and a common servant £3 10s., of\r\ncourse with food.[251] These figures clearly prove that the wages\r\nfixed by the magistrates were often terribly inadequate, though it\r\nmust be said in their defence that the great rise in prices probably\r\nstruck them as abnormal and not likely to last. It should be\r\nremembered, too, that besides his wages the labourer and his family\r\nhad often bye industries such as weaving to fall back upon, and in\r\nmost parts of England still a piece of common land to help him.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[238] _Description of Britain_, iii. 2.\r\n\r\n[239] _Transactions of the Royal Historical Society_ (New Series),\r\nxvii. 235.\r\n\r\n[240] Moryson, _Itinerary_ (ed. 1617), iii. 179.\r\n\r\n[241] _Archaeologia_ xiii. 371.\r\n\r\n[242] In 1650 it was much cultivated about London.\r\n\r\n[243] _Collections on Husbandry and Trade_, ii. 468.\r\n\r\n[244] _Six Centuries of Work and Wages_, p. 398.\r\n\r\n[245] Cunningham, _Industry and Commerce_, ii. 38.

It is strange to find food reckoned\r\nso highly; if the common labourer at Hawsted received his food, he was\r\nonly paid 5d. a day in winter, and 6d. in summer; if one man's food\r\nwas reckoned at half his wages, how far did the other half go in\r\nfeeding and clothing his family?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n1600-1700\r\n\r\nCLOVER AND TURNIPS.--GREAT RISE IN PRICES. MORE ENCLOSURE.--A FARMING\r\nCALENDAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth century was one of considerable progress in English\r\nagriculture. The decay of common-field farming was enabling individual\r\nenterprise to have its way. The population was rapidly growing; by\r\n1688 the returns of the hearth tax prove that the northern counties\r\nwere nearly as thickly populated as the southern, and prices during\r\nthe first half were continually rising, though after that they\r\nremained almost stationary, since the effect of the influx of precious\r\nmetals from the New World was exhausted. In the first half of the\r\ncentury John Smyth ascribes the advance of rents to the Castilian\r\nvoyages opening the New World, whereby such floods of treasure have\r\nflowed into Europe that the rates of Christendom are raised near\r\ntwentyfold'.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest agricultural event of the century was the\r\nintroduction of clover and the encouragement of turnips as grown in\r\nHolland, by Sir Richard Weston, about 1645. No doubt the turnip was\r\nalready well known in England. Tusser and Fitzherbert both mention it,\r\napparently as a garden root only; but Gerard in his _Herbal_, 1597,\r\nsays it grew in fields 'and divers vineyards or hoppe gardens in most\r\nplaces of England', which certainly points to an effort having been\r\nmade generally to use it as a field crop whenever an enclosed space\r\ngave it some protection from the depredations of the common herds.\r\nHowever, its cultivation must have declined, as long after this it was\r\nregarded as a novelty as a field crop in most parts of England.[252]\r\nIn Holland it had been used in the field universally, and this use\r\nwith that of 'great', as it was called, or broad clover, Weston\r\npressed on the English farmer. But their progress was wofully slow. At\r\nHawsted in Suffolk clover and turnips were first sown about 1700, and\r\nthe eastern portion of England was far ahead of the north and west; as\r\nlate as 1772 Arthur Young wrote that 'sainfoin, cabbages, potatoes,\r\nand carrots are not common crops in England; I do not imagine above\r\nhalf or at most two-thirds of the nation cultivate clover.'[253] Yet\r\ntheir introduction must have been of the greatest benefit to the\r\nfarmer and the public; his stock of hay was increased, he could\r\nutilize his fallows, and keep a much larger head of stock through the\r\nwinter, who would give him a greater quantity of manure. Every one\r\nwhere turnips were grown could now have fresh meat during the winter.\r\nThe slow progress of these great blessings is perhaps the strongest\r\ntestimony in our history of the innate conservatism of the farmer. The\r\ngreen crop was for long considered to be suited only to the garden,\r\nand as our forefathers were prejudiced against the spade it was\r\ndifficult to get such crops cultivated even there; but it should also\r\nbe remembered that no crop was possible in the common fields which did\r\nnot come to maturity before Lammas, unless some special agreement was\r\nmade as to it.[254] Clover, Sir Richard Weston said, thrives best when\r\nsown on the worst and barrenest ground, which was to be pared and\r\nburnt, and unslaked lime added to the ashes. Then it was to be well\r\nploughed and harrowed, and about 10 lb. of seed sown per acre in the\r\nend of March or in April. 'It will stand five years, and then when\r\nploughed up will yield three or four years running rich crops of\r\nwheat, and then a crop of oats, after which you may sow clover again.'\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century the practice of liming and marling, which\r\nhad been largely discontinued since the fourteenth century, was\r\nrevived (Westcote, in his _View of Devon_ in 1630, calls liming, &c.,\r\na new invention), and there was also a great improvement in\r\nimplements. Patents were taken out for draining machines in 1628, for\r\nnew manures in 1633-6, ploughs 1623-7 and 1634, mechanical sowing\r\n1634-9. Only six were taken out, however, between 1640 and 1760 that\r\nconcerned agriculture.[255] The Civil War checked the improvement, for\r\nthough the great mass of the people had nothing to do with either\r\nparty, the country was of necessity in a very unsettled state, and\r\nboth sides plundered indiscriminately. Yet in some parts, as in\r\nDevonshire, so many of the able men served in the two armies, that few\r\nbut old men, women, and children were left to manage the farms, and\r\neven they were afraid to grow more than enough to supply themselves\r\nsince both armies seized the crops.[256] These bad effects lasted for\r\nsome time afterwards; Chapple, a Devonshire land agent of the\r\neighteenth century, says he had talked with people who remembered the\r\nstate of husbandry in the last ten or twelve years of the reign of\r\nCharles II, when in many parts of Devonshire an acre or two of wheat\r\nwas esteemed a rarity.\r\n\r\nThat the rate of progress in the century was not more rapid is\r\nattributed by Blyth to several causes[257]:--\r\n\r\n  1. Want of leases, by which tenants were deprived of security.\r\n\r\n  2. Discouragement to flood (irrigate) land, from the risk of\r\n     law suits with neighbours.\r\n\r\n  3. Intermixture of different properties in common fields.\r\n\r\n  4. Unlimited pasturage on commons, by which they were overstocked.\r\n\r\n  5. The want of a law compelling all men to kill moles.\r\n\r\n  6. The excessive number of water-mills, to the great destruction\r\n     of much gallant land.\r\n\r\nThe average price of wheat during the seventeenth century was 41s. a\r\nquarter, of barley 22s., and oats 14s. 8-1/2d. Oxen averaged about £5\r\napiece, cows much less, about £3, and there was not much change in\r\ntheir value during the century. Sheep were about 10s. 6d., and a\r\ncart-horse in the first half of the century from £5 to £10, in the\r\nsecond half from £8 to £15. Beef rose from 2d. a lb. in the early part\r\nof the century to 3d. at the close of it. Wool remained stationary at\r\nfrom 9d. to 1s. per lb.\r\n\r\n[258]A proclamation of 1633 fixed the\r\nfollowing prices for London poulterers and victuallers:--\r\n\r\n                                     s.   d.\r\n\r\n  Best turkey-cock                   4    4\r\n  Duck                                    8\r\n  Best hen                           1    0\r\n  3 eggs                                  1\r\n  1 lb. best fresh butter in winter       6\r\n  1 lb. best fresh butter in summer       5\r\n  1 lb. best salt butter                  4-1/2\r\n  Best fat goose                      2   0\r\n   \"   crammed capon                  2   6\r\n   \"   pullet                         1   6\r\n   \"   chicken                            6\r\n\r\nAccording to the _Manydown Manor Rolls_ the Wootton churchwardens in\r\n1600 paid from 8s. to 11s. for calves, 4s. 4d. for a fat lamb, 8s. for\r\na sheep, 6s. 8d. for a barren ewe, 6d. for a couple of chickens, 1s.\r\n6d. for 500 faggots.[259]\r\n\r\nAfter the restoration in 1660 another period of prosperity set\r\nin,[260] and altogether the century was a prosperous one for farmers\r\nand manufacturers. The newly established Royal Society materially\r\nhelped agriculture. 'Since his majesty's most happy restoration the\r\nwhole land hath been fermented and stirred up by the profitable hints\r\nit hath received from the Royal Society, by which means parks have\r\nbeen disparked, commons enclosed, woods turned into arable, and\r\npasture lands improved by clover, St. foine, turnips, cole-seed, and\r\nmany other good husbandries, so that the food of cattle is increased\r\nas fast, if not faster, than the consumption, and by these means the\r\nrent of the kingdom is far greater than ever it was.'[261] The century\r\nwas distinguished also for the curious number of cycles of good and\r\nbad seasons; 1646-50 were years of prolonged dearth, wheat reaching an\r\nenormous price, and 1661-2, were famine years, while the end of the\r\ncentury was long famous for its barren years.\r\n\r\nWith the prices of produce rents rose enormously. Very early in the\r\ncentury[262] rents of arable land had increased ninefold, since the\r\nfifteenth century, and by 1688 Davenant and King estimated the average\r\nrent of arable land in England at 5s. 6d. per acre and of permanent\r\ngrass at 8s. 8d. Perhaps this is too high an estimate, as on the\r\nBelvoir estate of 17,837 acres in 1692 the rental all round was 3s.\r\n9-1/4d. an acre for land above the average in quality, though it must\r\nbe remembered that the Earls and Dukes of Rutland were indulgent\r\nlandlords.\r\n\r\nThe _History of Hawsted_ affords a valuable index of the increase of\r\nrents at this period.[263] In 1500 the average rent was 1s. 4d. an\r\nacre; in 1572, 39 acres of arable, meadow, and pasture were let for\r\n2s. 3d. an acre, the landlord, it is interesting to notice, reserving\r\nthe right of hawking, netting rabbits, hunting, and fowling; and about\r\nthe same date other lands on the estate were let at 1s. 3d. and 1s.\r\n6d. an acre, so that there had not generally been much advance since\r\n1500, which is what we should expect, as the great rise took place at\r\nthe end of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncenturies. In 1589, therefore, it is not surprising to find that 40\r\nacres of meadow and pasture let at 5s. an acre, and in 1611 some\r\nbuildings and 155 acres of park at 11s. an acre. In 1616, 366 acres of\r\narable and pasture and 39 acres of meadow were valued at 12s. an acre\r\nfor letting, and the Hall Farm of 175 acres (8-1/2 acres meadow) at\r\n10s.; and Great Pipers Farm of 138 acres (8 meadow) at 7s., while\r\nmeadow and pasture near the mansion was valued at 21s. an acre.\r\n\r\nIn 1658 the rent of the Hall Farm had advanced from 10s. an acre to\r\nabout 13s., though in 1682 it went down to 11s. 6d.[264] According to\r\nthe survey of the Manor of Manydown in Hampshire in 1650, meadow land\r\nwas worth 20s. an acre, pasture 8s. to 10s., arable from 2s. to 10s.,\r\nthe latter showing a great variation in quality.[265] In 1723 Bryers\r\nWood Farm at Hawsted, which had been let in 1620 for £15, was let at\r\n£29 5s. These rents are considerably higher than the estimate of\r\nDavenant and King; but it must be remembered that they were for land\r\nin the parts of England, where farming was at its best, and they, in\r\naccounting for the whole country, had to take into consideration a\r\nvast amount of land in the north and west which was worth very little.\r\nIn the Rawlinson Collection[266] in the Bodleian Library is a rental\r\nof Lord Kingston's estate in north Nottinghamshire in 1689, the rents\r\naveraging 10s. an acre; but this was an exceptionally good estate,\r\nmuch of the property being meadow and pasture. The farmhouses also\r\nwere above the average, while in two of the parishes the tenants had\r\nrights of common, and in two others the tenancies were tithe free.\r\nThere was very little arable land on the estate, three small holdings\r\nletting for 6s. 8d. an acre; and some of the pasture land was let at\r\n14s., 15s. 6d., and even 18s. an acre. The largest farm, Saundby Hall,\r\nof 607 acres, nearly all meadow and pasture, was 9s. 10d. an acre. The\r\ncottages were fortunate in having pieces of land attached to them. In\r\nSaundby, Richard Ffydall rented a cottage and 2 acres of arable land\r\nfor £1 13s. 4d.; Widow Johnson a cottage and yard for 13s. 4d.;\r\nWilliam Daubney a cottage with 6-1/2 acres of arable and 5-1/2 acres\r\nof pasture for £7 18s. 6d. A farm in Scrooby, consisting of a\r\nmessuage, cottage, and 113 acres of arable, meadow, and pasture, only\r\nlet at £23.\r\n\r\nAs to the freehold value of land, in 1621, according to D'Ewes, it was\r\nworth from sixteen to twenty years' purchase; yet, in 1688, Sir Josiah\r\nChild said that lands now sell at twenty years' purchase, which fifty\r\nor sixty years before sold at eight or ten; and he also states, 'the\r\nsame farms or lands to be now sold would yield treble and in some\r\ncases six times the money they were sold for fifty years ago'.[267]\r\nDavenant puts land at twelve years' purchase in 1600, at eighteen\r\nyears in 1688.[268] In 1729 the price of land was said to be\r\ntwenty-seven years' purchased.[269]\r\n\r\nThe legislation against laying down tillage to grass was continued\r\nuntil the end of the sixteenth century. The statute 39 Eliz., c. 1,\r\nrepealed 4 Hen. VII, c. 19, and all other Acts against pulling down\r\nhouses, and provided that a house of husbandry should be a house that\r\nhath or hath had 20 acres of arable land. All such houses which had\r\nbeen destroyed during the last seven years were to be rebuilt, and if\r\ndestroyed more than seven years only one-half was to be rebuilt; but\r\nto each of them at least 40 acres of land were to be attached.\r\n\r\nThe next statute, 39 Eliz., c. 2, sets forth once more the advantages\r\nof tillage, viz. the increase and multiplying of people for service in\r\nthe wars, and in time of peace the employment of a greater number of\r\npeople, the keeping of people from poverty, the dispersal of the\r\nwealth of the kingdom in many hands, and 'the standing of this realm\r\nupon itself without depending upon foreign countries'[270]; and\r\ntherefore enacts that lands converted from tillage to pasture shall be\r\nrestored to tillage within three years, and lands then in tillage\r\nshould be so continued; but this was only to extend to twenty-three\r\ncounties, and omitted most of those in the south-west. At the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth century a reaction set in; the price of\r\ncorn had risen immensely and continued to do so, the price of wool\r\nremained stationary, and tillage was as profitable as grass. In 1620\r\nCoke speaks of the man who only kept a shepherd and a dog as one who\r\nnever prospered. In 1624 several of the tillage laws were\r\nrepealed.[271]\r\n\r\nAs an example of the unenclosed fields, at the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, we may take the common fields at Daventry, which were three\r\nin number, containing respectively 368, 383, and 524 acres, divided\r\ninto furlongs, a term which had now a very wide signification, each of\r\nwhich was subdivided into lands nearly always half an acre in extent,\r\nseveral of these lands when adjoining being often held now by the same\r\nowner. One furlong may be taken as an example. It was 37 acres 1 rood\r\nin extent, and contained ninety-six lands, owned by seventeen people.\r\nThe meadows were divided still more minutely, some of the smaller\r\nportions being only a quarter of an acre each. The largest meadow\r\ncontained 50 acres, divided among fifty-three people. In the manor,\r\nbesides the arable and meadow, there were 300 acres of common\r\npasture, a park, and a small wood. There were forty-one freeholders\r\nand many leasehold tenants, the average freehold being 34 acres, the\r\naverage leasehold only half an acre, small holdings being the usual\r\nfeature of the unenclosed township.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century the price of wool ceased to operate as a\r\ncause of enclosure, but in many parts the change to pasture continued,\r\nowing to the rise in price of cattle and of wages. The same reason,\r\ntoo, for laying down land to grass that had been so powerful in the\r\npreceding centuries still existed, the common arable fields needed\r\nrest from continual cropping and poor manuring, while good crops of\r\ncorn could be grown from the virgin soil of the newly enclosed waste.\r\nThe preamble of the Durham decrees clearly states this: 'the land is\r\nwasted and worn with continual ploweing, and thereby made bare,\r\nbarren, and very unfruitful.'[272] We may, therefore, take Coke's\r\nwords as inapplicable to many districts. In the seventeenth century\r\nthere were several methods of enclosing. Sometimes the lord of the\r\nmanor enclosed and left the land of the tenants still in common; or a\r\ntenant enclosed piece by piece; or enclosures were made by Act of\r\nParliament, the earliest of which for common fields was passed in the\r\ntime of James I, a method at this period very seldom used; or there\r\nwas an agreement between lord and tenants often authorized by the\r\nCourts of Chancery or Exchequer.\r\n\r\nBesides enclosure, another process was going on, the consolidation of\r\nfarms by the amalgamation of small holdings into larger ones.\r\nFarmhouses, as we see them to-day, began to appear on the holdings\r\nthus consolidated, instead of being grouped together in villages. A\r\nwriter in 1604 says, 'we may see many of their houses built alone like\r\nraven's nests, no birds building neere them' so unwonted was the sight\r\nof isolated dwellings in most places at the time.\r\n\r\nHowever, in 1630 Charles I went back to the policy of his forefathers\r\nand issued letters to certain of the Midland counties ordering all\r\nenclosures of the last two years to be removed, and Commissions were\r\nissued to inquire into the matter in 1632, 1635, and 1636,[273] the\r\nchief evil feared from enclosures being depopulation, and enclosers\r\nwere prosecuted in the Court of Star Chamber.\r\n\r\nThe assertion that enclosures ceased during the seventeenth century\r\nhas been proved inaccurate by modern research, and there is no doubt\r\nthat they went on continuously. In 1607, in the Midlands, the\r\nenclosing of land produced serious armed resistance, probably because\r\nthe Midland counties were then the great corn-growing district of\r\nEngland, and the change to pasture and the consolidation of farms\r\ndisplaced a larger population there than elsewhere. Between 1628 and\r\n1630 enclosures in Leicestershire, for instance, were very numerous,\r\nno less than 10,000 acres being enclosed in that time, most of which\r\nwas converted to pasture. The attempt of the Government to check the\r\nmovement, initiated by Charles I, seems to have had considerable\r\neffect, but died away with the Civil War, and though other attempts\r\nwere made under the Commonwealth they came to nothing, and from this\r\ntime enclosures went on unchecked by the Government,[274] and were\r\nsoon to have its active support. Yet there was a vast amount still in\r\ncommon field: the whole of the cultivated land of England in 1685 was\r\nstated by King and Davenant to amount to not much more than half the\r\ntotal area, and of this cultivated portion three-fifths was still\r\nfarmed on the old common-field system. Northamptonshire,\r\nLeicestershire, Rutland, Huntingdonshire, and Bedfordshire were\r\ncomparatively unenclosed.[275] From the books and maps of the day 'it\r\nis clear that many routes which now pass through an endless succession\r\nof orchards, corn-fields, hay-fields, and bean-fields then ran through\r\nnothing but heath, swamp, and warren. In the drawings of an English\r\nlandscape made in that age for the Grand Duke Cosmo scarce a hedgerow\r\nis to be seen.... At Enfield, hardly out of sight of the smoke of the\r\ncapital, was a region of five-and-twenty miles in circumference which\r\ncontained only three houses and scarcely any enclosed fields.'[276]\r\nThe enclosure of these areas was to be mainly the work of the latter\r\nhalf of the eighteenth and the first quarter of the nineteenth\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nThe amount of enclosure in the fifteenth, sixteenth, and the first\r\nhalf of the seventeenth centuries was, according to the latest\r\nresearch, much, and perhaps very naturally, exaggerated by\r\ncontemporaries. Between 1455-1607 the enclosures in twenty-four\r\ncounties are said to have amounted to some 500,000 acres, or 2.76 of\r\ntheir total area,[277] but the evidence for this is by no means\r\nconclusive. However, there seems no reason to doubt that the enclosure\r\nof this period was but a faint beginning of that great outburst of it\r\nthat marked the agrarian revolution of the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and that it was mainly confined to the Midland counties, Mr.\r\nJohnson, in his recent Ford Lectures, has stated that the enclosure of\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was not accompanied by very\r\nmuch direct eviction of freeholders or bona fide copyholders of\r\ninheritance; yet the small holder suffered in many ways, e.g. by the\r\nlord disproving the hereditary character of the copyhold, or by\r\nchanging copyholds of inheritance into copyholds for lives or leases\r\nfor lives or years. He and his successors could then refuse to renew\r\nat the termination of lives or years except on payment of a\r\npractically prohibitory fine. In short, though there was not much\r\nviolation of legal right there was much injustice, and enclosure,\r\nthough its effects were exaggerated at this period, certainly tended\r\nto displace the small landholder. It does not appear, however, that\r\nthe moderate-sized proprietors were seriously affected. Many of the\r\nlarger freeholders and copyholders on manors enclosed on their own\r\naccount, and perhaps increased at the expense of the very large and\r\nthe very small. Indeed, the decrease of small landowners was chiefly\r\ndue to political and social causes. The old self-sufficing,\r\nagricultural economy of England, which we have seen beginning to break\r\nup in the fourteenth century, was becoming thoroughly disintegrated.\r\nThe capitalist class was increasing; the successful merchant and\r\nlawyer were acquiring land and becoming squires; there was an intense\r\nland hunger. Simon Degge, wilting of Staffordshire in 1669, says that\r\nin the previous sixty years half the lands had changed owners, not so\r\nmuch as of old they were wont to do, by marriage, but by purchase; and\r\nhe notices how many lawyers and tradesmen have supplanted the\r\ngentry.[278]\r\n\r\nIn fact, there was a much freer disposal of lands from the end of the\r\nfifteenth century, when the famous Taltarum's case enabled entailed\r\nestates to be barred, until the Restoration, than there has been\r\nbefore or since. For these two hundred years the courts of law and\r\nparliament resisted every effort to re-establish the system of\r\nentails; the owners of land constantly multiplied, and this tendency\r\nmust have counteracted the displacement of the small holder by\r\nenclosure. Sir Thomas Smith, writing towards the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, says that it was the yeomen who bought the lands of\r\n'unthrifty gentlemen;' and Moryson tells us that 'the buyers\r\n(excepting lawyers) are for the most part citizens and vulgar\r\nmen'.[279] It became one of the boasts of England that she had a large\r\nnumber of yeomen farming their own land. During the Civil War,\r\nhowever, it became important to landowners to protect their properties\r\nin the interest of children and descendants from forfeiture for\r\ntreason. The judges lent their aid, and the system of strict family\r\nsettlements was devised, under which the great bulk of the estates in\r\nEngland are now held. This system favoured the accumulation of lands\r\nin a few hands and the aggregation of great estates, and was largely\r\nresponsible for the disappearance of the small freeholder.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the progress of agriculture in the seventeenth century,\r\nthe drainage of the fen country of Lincolnshire and the adjoining\r\ncounties must not be forgotten. It had been for centuries the scene of\r\ndrainage operations on a more or less extended scale, few of which,\r\nhowever, met with success; but in the seventeenth century the growing\r\nvalue of land caused a serious revival of these efforts. Attempts made\r\nunder Elizabeth and James I had only succeeded in rescuing a certain\r\namount of land for pasture,[280] but in the reign of Charles I the\r\nscheme of Cornelius Vermuyden was more successful. His system,\r\nhowever, was defective, and in the reign of Charles II the Bedford\r\nLevel was in a lamentable state and in danger of reverting to its\r\nprimitive condition. Many of the works too were destroyed by the\r\n'stiltwalkers', and in 1793 Maxwell states that out of 44,000 acres of\r\nfen land in Huntingdonshire only 8,000 or 10,000 were productive[281];\r\nand in 1794 Stone tells us that the commons round the Isle of\r\nAxholme were chiefly covered with water.[282] Still to Vermuyden and\r\nhis contemporaries must be assigned the credit of the first\r\ncomprehensive scheme for rescuing these fertile lands from the waters\r\nthat covered them.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of this important century an old calendar of\r\n1606[283] clearly sets forth the farming work of the year:--\r\n\r\nJanuary and February are the best months for ploughing for peas,\r\nbeans, and oats, and to have peas soon in the year following sow them\r\nin the wane of the moon at S. Andrewstide before Christmas; which may\r\nbe compared to Tusser's advice for February,\r\n\r\n     'Go plow in the stubble, for now is the season\r\n     For sowing of fitches of beans and of peason.'\r\n\r\n'Clean grounds of all such rubbish as briars, brambles, blackthorns,\r\nand shrubbs' (then more often choking the ground than now), which are\r\nto be fagoted as good fuel for baking and brewing.\r\n\r\n'Do not plough in rainy weather, for it impoverisheth the earth.'\r\n\r\nMarch and April. Take up colts from grass to be broken. Sow beans,\r\npeas, and oats. In these months are all grounds where cattle went in\r\nthe last winter to be furthed (apparently managed) and cleared and the\r\nmole-hills scattered, that the fresh spring of grass may grow better.\r\nAll hedges and ditches to be made betwixt 'severals', evidently\r\nenclosures as distinguished from common fields. From March 25 to May 1\r\nsummer pastures are to be spared, that they may have time to get head\r\nbefore summer cattle be put in. In the meantime such cattle are to be\r\nbestowed in meadows till May Day, and after that date such meadows are\r\nto be cleansed and spared until the crops of hay be taken off. From\r\nnow till midsummer sell fat cattle and sheep, and with the money buy\r\nlean cattle and sheep. Sow barley.\r\n\r\nMay and June. Sort all cattle for their summer pasture on May Day,\r\nviz. draught oxen by themselves, milch cows by themselves, weaning\r\ncalves, yearlings, two-year-olds, three- and four-year-olds, every\r\nsort by themselves, which being divided in pasture fitting for them\r\nwill make larger and fairer cattle. Separate the horses in the same\r\nway. Wash sheep and shear four or five days after, which done the wool\r\nis to be well wound and weighed, and safely laid up in some place\r\nwhere there is not too much air or it will lose weight, nor where it\r\nis damp or it will increase too much in weight. Cleanse winter corn\r\nfrom thistles and weeds.\r\n\r\nJuly and August. First of all comes hay-making. In August wean lambs,\r\nand put them in good pasture, and in winter put them in fresh pasture\r\nuntil spring, and then put them with the 'holding' sheep.\r\n\r\nIn these months is corn to be 'shornne or mowen downe' (the writer, it\r\nis to be noticed, has no preference for either method); and after the\r\ncorn is carried put draught horses and oxen into the averish (corn\r\nstubble), to ease other pastures; and after them put hogs in. Gather\r\ncrabs in woods and hedgerows for making verjuice.\r\n\r\nSeptember and October. Have all plows and harrows neat and fit for\r\nsowing of wheat, rye, mesling (wheat and rye mixed), and vetches.[284]\r\n\r\nPick hops. Buy store cattle, both steers and heifers, of three or four\r\nyears old, which being well wintered at grass, or on straw at the barn\r\ndoors, will be the sooner fed the summer following, and they will\r\nsooner feed after straw than grass.\r\n\r\nFrom October to May are calves to be reared, because then they be more\r\nhardly bred and become the stronger cattle. Feed brawns, bacons,\r\nlards, and porkets on mast if there is any, if not on corn. 'In these\r\nmonths cleanse poundes or pools, this season being the driest;' an\r\nextraordinary assertion, unless the climate has changed, seeing that\r\naccording to the monthly averages from 1841-1906, taken at the Royal\r\nObservatory, Greenwich, October is the wettest month in the year.[285]\r\n\r\nNovember and December. Sort all kinds of sheep until Lady Day, viz.\r\nwethers by themselves, and weaning lambs by themselves; and do not put\r\nrams to the ewes before S. Lukestide, October 18, for those lambs fall\r\nabout March 25, and if they fall before then the scarcity of grass and\r\nthe cold will so nip and chill them that they will die or be\r\nweaklings. It is good at this time to take draught cattle and horses\r\nfrom grass into the house before any great storms begin. Thrash corn\r\nnow after it hath had a good sweat in the mow, and so dried again, and\r\ngive the straw to the draught oxen and cattle at the standaxe or at\r\nthe barn doors for sparing of hay, advice which Tusser also gives:\r\n\r\n     'Serve rie straw out first, then wheat straw and peas,\r\n     Then ote straw and barley, then hay if ye please.'\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[252] _R.A.S.E.

A SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ORCHARD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth century is distinguished by a number of agricultural\r\nwriters whose works, as they afford the best account of the farming of\r\nthe time, we may be pardoned for freely quoting. The best known of\r\nthem were, Sir John Norden, Gervase Markham, Sir Richard Weston,\r\nBlythe, Hartlib, Sir Hugh Plat, John Evelyn, John Worlidge, and\r\nHoughton.\r\n\r\nSir John Norden printed his _Surveyor's Dialogue_ in 1608, which is in\r\nthe form of a conversation between a farmer and a surveyor, the former\r\nat the outset telling the latter that men of his profession were then\r\nvery unpopular because 'you pry into men's titles and estates, and\r\noftentimes you are the cause that men lose their land, and customs are\r\naltered, broken, and sometimes perverted by your means. And above all,\r\nyou look into the values of men's lands, wherefore the lords of manors\r\ndo reckon their tenants to a higher rent, and therefore not only I but\r\nmany poore tenants have good cause to speak against the\r\nprofession'.[286]\r\n\r\nThe surveyor attributes the increase in prices to farmers outbidding\r\none another for farms, for the rents of farms and prices grow\r\ntogether; a statement which seems to have been quite true and disposes\r\nof the assertion that the landlords raised the rents unfairly, for\r\nthey were quite entitled to what rent they could get in the open\r\nmarket, the farmers being presumably wise enough not to offer rents\r\nwhich would preclude a profit. He further blames the farmer of his day\r\nfor being discontented with his lot: in former times 'farmers and\r\ntheir wives were content with mean dyet and base attire and held their\r\nchildren to some austere government, without haunting alehouses,\r\ntaverns, dice, and cards; now the husbandman will be equal to the\r\nyeoman, the yeoman to the gentleman, the gentleman to the squire, and\r\nthere is at this day thirty times as much vainely spent in a family of\r\nlike multitude and quality as was in former ages'; a complaint that\r\nhas been common in all ages. Contrary to what is the practice to-day,\r\nand apparently to common sense, the surveyor recommends that open\r\ndrains be made as narrow above as at the bottom, at the most not more\r\nthan a foot and a half broad.[287] Hops, he says, were then grown in\r\nSuffolk, Essex, and Surrey, 'in your loose and spongie grounds,\r\ntrenched.' 'Carret' roots were raised in Suffolk and Essex, and\r\nbeginning to increase in all parts of the realm[288]; but if he\r\nalludes to their cultivation in the open field the statement must be\r\ntaken with considerable qualification, as they were not so grown\r\ngenerally until the end of the eighteenth century or the beginning of\r\nthe next.\r\n\r\nKent was then, as now, the great fruit county of England; 'above all\r\nothers I think the Kentishmen be most apt and industrious in planting\r\norchards with pippins and cherries, especially near the Thames about\r\nFeversham and Sittingbourne.' But Devon and Hereford were also famous;\r\nWestcote about 1630 says the Devonshire men had of late much enlarged\r\ntheir orchards, and 'are very curious in planting and grafting all\r\nkinds of fruit'[289]; and John Beale in 1656 tells us Hereford 'is\r\nreputed the orchard of England'[290]; while Hartlib says there were\r\nmany orchards in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire.[291] He calls\r\n'Tandeane' near Taunton the Paradise of England, where the husbandry\r\nwas excellent, the land fruitful by nature and improved by the art and\r\nindustry of the farmers; 'they take extraordinary pains in soyling,\r\nploughing, and dressing their lands, and after the plow there goeth\r\nsome three or four with mattocks to break the clods and to draw up the\r\nearth out of the furrows that the lands may lye round, and that the\r\nwater annoy not the seed (the water evidently often lying long in the\r\nfurrows between the great high ridges), and to that end they most\r\ncarefully cut gutters and trenches in all places. And for the better\r\nenriching of their ploughing lands they cut up, cast, and carry in the\r\nunplowed headlands and places of no use. Their hearts, hands, eyes,\r\nand all their powers concurre in one to force the earth to yield her\r\nutmost fruit; and the crops of wheat that rewarded this industry were\r\nsometimes 8 and 10 quarters to an acre.\r\n\r\nA short pamphlet called the _Fruiterer's Secrets_, published in London\r\nin 1604, imparts some interesting and curious information about fruit\r\ngrowing.[292] There were then four sorts of cherries in England,\r\nFlemish,[293] English, Gascoyne, and black, and the preserving of them\r\nfrom birds, always a burden on the grower, the author says can be done\r\nby a gun or a sling; the worst enemies being jays and bullfinches, who\r\nate stones and all. Stone fruit should be gathered in dry weather, and\r\nafter the dew is off, for if gathered wet it loses colour and becomes\r\nmildewed. If nettles newly gathered are laid at the bottom of the\r\nbasket and on the top of the fruit, they will hasten the ripening of\r\nfruit picked unripe, and make it keep its colour.\r\n\r\nThose English farmers who still shake their apples from the trees to\r\nfall and be bruised on the ground had better listen to the careful\r\ndirections for placing the ladder on the trees where it will do no\r\ndamage, as to the use of the gathering hook so that the branches can\r\nbe brought within easy reach of the picker on his ladder, the wearing\r\nof a gathering apron, and the emptying of it gently into the baskets.\r\nGreen fern has the same effect on pears packed for carriage as nettles\r\non stone fruit; while apples should be packed in wheat, or better\r\nstill in rye straw. For long journeys the American system of packing\r\nin barrels is anticipated, the apples being carefully put in by hand,\r\nand the barrels lined at both ends with straw, but not at the sides to\r\navoid heating, while holes should be bored at either end to prevent\r\nheat. Pippins, John Apples, Pearmains, and other 'keepers' need not be\r\nturned until the week before Christmas, and again at the end of March,\r\nwhen they must be turned oftener; but never touch fruit during a frost\r\nor a thaw, or in rainy weather, or it will turn black.\r\n\r\nHartlib, a few years after, reckoned no less than 500 sorts of apples\r\nin England, though doubtless many of these were identical, since the\r\nsame apple often has two or three names in one parish. The best for\r\nthe table were the Jennetings, Harvey Apple, Golden Pippin, Summer and\r\nWinter Pearmains, John Apple, &c.; for cider the Red Streak (the great\r\nfavourite), Jennet Moyle, Eliot, Stocking Apple, &c. He was told that\r\nin Herefordshire a tenant bought the farm he rented with the fruit\r\ncrop of one year; £10 to £15 having been given per acre for cherries\r\nand more for apples and pears. Pears for the table were the Windsor,\r\n'Burgamet,' 'Boon Christians'! Greenfield, and others; and for perry,\r\nwhich John Beale, a well-known writer of the day considered 'a weak\r\ndrink, fit for our hindes and generally refused by our gentry as\r\nbreeding wind in the stomack', the Horse Pear, Bosbury, Choak,\r\n&c.[294] There were many kinds of plums, among them the Mistle Plum,\r\nDamazene, Violet, and Premorden.\r\n\r\nFour kinds of grafting were practised: in the cleft, and in the bark,\r\nthe two most usual ways; shoulder or whip grafting, and grafting by\r\napproach,[295] the last 'where the stock you intend to graft on and the\r\ntree from which you take your graft stand so near together that they\r\nmay be joined, then take the sprig you intend to graft and pare away\r\nabout three inches in length of the rind and wood near unto the very\r\npith, and cut also the stock on which you intend to graft the same\r\nafter the same manner that they may evenly join each other, and so\r\nbind them and cover them with clay or wax.' Inoculation was also\r\npractised, 'when the sap is at the fullest in the summer, the buds you\r\nintend to inoculate being not too young but sufficiently grown.' For\r\ntransplanting the middle of October is recommended, and the wise\r\nadvice added, 'plant not too deep,' and in clay plant as near the\r\nsurface as possible, for the roots will seek their way downward but\r\nrarely upward; and in transplanting 'you may prune the branches as\r\nwell as the roots of apples and pears, but not of plums.' The best\r\ndistance apart in an orchard for apples and pears was considered to be\r\nfrom 20 to 30 feet, the further apart the more they benefit from the\r\nsun and air, a piece of advice which many a subsequent planter has\r\nneglected. For cherries and plums 15 to 20 feet was thought right.\r\nWorlidge's directions for pruning are minute and careful, and should\r\nbe well hammered into many slovenly farmers to-day.\r\n\r\nCider-making was performed much as it is in old-fashioned farms\r\nto-day, by mashing the apples in a trough by means of a millstone set\r\nedgeways, and then pressing the juice out through hair mats, the\r\njuice, says Hartlib, 'having been let stand a day or two and the black\r\nscum that ariseth in that time taken off they tunne it, and in the\r\nbarrels it continueth to work some days longer, just as beer useth to\r\ndo.[296] Another method was to put the fruit in a clean vessel or\r\ntrough, and bruise or crush it with beetles, then put the crushed\r\nfruit in a bag of hair-cloth and press it.[297] After the cider was in\r\nthe barrels there was placed in them a linen bag containing cloves,\r\nmace, cinnamon, ginger, and lemon peel which was said to make the\r\ncider taste as pleasantly as Rhenish wine.\r\n\r\nWorlidge gives us what is perhaps the first mention of a poultry farm,\r\nand strangely enough it seems to have paid. 'I have been credibly\r\ninformed that a good farm hath been wholly stocked with poultry,\r\nspending the whole crop upon them and keeping severall to attend them,\r\nand that it hath redounded to a very considerable improvement'.[298]\r\nIncubators of a very rude sort were used, three or four dozen eggs\r\nbeing placed in a 'lamp furnace made of a few boards', and hatched by\r\nthe heat of a lamp or candle.\r\n\r\nIt must strike the reader that the accusation levelled against the\r\nEnglish farmer, of having made little progress in his art from the\r\nMiddle Ages to the commencement of the reign of George III is hardly\r\nwarranted. Their knowledge and skill in their business were evidently\r\nsuch as to make considerable progress inevitable, and then as now they\r\nwere in some cases assisted by their landlords, as in Herefordshire,\r\nwhere Lord Scudamore, after the assassination of his friend the Duke\r\nof Buckingham, devoted his energies to the culture of fruit, and with\r\nother public-spirited gentlemen turned that county into 'one entire\r\norchard', besides improving the pastures and woods[299]; though\r\nHartlib laments that gentlemen try so few experiments for the\r\nadvancement of agriculture, and that both landowners and farmers\r\ninstead of communicating their knowledge to each other kept it\r\njealously to themselves.[300] The chief hindrance to landlord and\r\ntenant was that the heavy hand of ancient custom lay upon them, with\r\nits antiquated communistic system of farming, which still in the\r\ngreater part of the land of England utterly prevented good husbandry\r\nand stifled individual effort. It was one of these Herefordshire\r\ngentlemen. Rowland Vaughan, who in 1610 wrote what is probably the\r\nfirst account of irrigation in England, though the art was mentioned\r\nby Fitzherbert and must have been known in Devon and Hampshire long\r\nbefore his time; indeed, it is another instance of the then isolation\r\nof country districts that he speaks as if he had made a new discovery.\r\nHe tells us that 'having sojourned two years in his father's house,\r\nwearied in doing nothing and fearing his fortunes had been overthrown,\r\nhe cast about what was best to be done to retrieve his reputation'.\r\nAnd one day he saw from a mole-hill on the side of a brook on his\r\nproperty a little stream of water issuing down the working of the\r\nmole, which made the ground 'pleasing green', and from this he was led\r\non to what he calls 'the drowning of his lands'. This was so\r\nsuccessful that he improved the value of his estate from £40 to £300 a\r\nyear, and his neighbours, who of course had first scoffed at him, came\r\nto learn from him. Not many years after 'drowning' was said to have\r\nbecome one of the most universal and advantageous improvements in\r\nEngland.[301] Vaughan says that he had counted as many as 300 persons\r\ngleaning in one field after harvest, and that in the mountains near\r\neggs were 20 a penny, and a good bullock 26s. 3d., but this was a\r\nbackward region.[302]\r\n\r\nBetween 1617 and 1621 the price of wheat fell from 43s. 3d. to 21s. a\r\nquarter, and immediately affected the payment of rent.[303] Mr. John\r\nChamberlain, in February, 1620, wrote to Sir Dudley Carleton, 'We are\r\nhere in a strange state to complain of plenty, but so it is that corn\r\nbeareth so low a price that farmers are very backward to pay their\r\nrents and in many places plead disability: for remedy whereof the\r\nCouncil have written letters into every shire to provide a granary\r\nwith a stock to buy corn and keep it for a dear year.' Sir Symonds\r\nD'Ewes notes in his diary that 'at this time (1621) the rates of all\r\nsorts of corn were so extremely low as it made the very prices of land\r\nfall from twenty years' purchase to sixteen or seventeen. For the best\r\nwheat was sold for 2s. 8d. and 2s. 6d. the bushel, the ordinary at 2s.\r\nBarley and rye at 1s. 4d. and 1s. 3d. the bushel, and the worser of\r\nthose grains at a meaner rate, the poorer sort that would have been\r\nglad but a few years before of coarse rye bread, did now usually\r\ntraverse the markets to find out the finer wheats as if nothing else\r\nwould please their palates'. Instead of being glad that they were for\r\nonce having a small share of the good things of this world, he\r\nrejoices that their unthankfulness and daintiness was soon punished by\r\nhigh prices and dearness of all sorts of grain.[304] The year 1630 was\r\nthe commencement of a series of dear seasons, when for nine\r\nconsecutive years the price of wheat did not fall below 40s. a quarter\r\nand actually touched 86s. The restraints laid on corn-dealers had,\r\nsince the principles of commerce were being better understood, been\r\nmodified in 1624, but the high prices revived the old hatred against\r\nthem, and we find Sir John Wingfield writing from Rutland that he has\r\n'taken order that ingrossers of corne shall be carefullie seen unto\r\nand that there is no Badger (corn-dealer) licensed to carry corne out\r\nof this countrye nor any starch made of any kind of graine'. He adds\r\nthat he had 'refrayned the maulsters from excessive making of mault,\r\nand had suppressed 20 alehouses'.[305] However, the senseless policy\r\nof preventing trade in corn received a severe blow from the statute 15\r\nCar. II, c. 7, which enacted that when corn was under 48s. persons\r\nwere to be allowed to buy and store corn and sell the same again\r\nwithout penalty, provided they did not sell it in the same market\r\nwithin three months of buying it, a statute which Adam Smith said\r\ncontributed more to the progress of agriculture than any previous law\r\nin the statute book.\r\n\r\nGervase Markham, who was born about 1568 and died in 1637, gives us a\r\ndescription of the day's work of the English farmer. He is to rise at\r\nfour in the morning, feed his cattle and clean his stable. While they\r\nare feeding he is to get his harness ready, which will take him two\r\nhours. Then he is to have his breakfast, for which half an hour is\r\nallowed. Getting the harness on his horses or cattle, he is to start\r\nby seven to his work and keep at it till between two and three in the\r\nafternoon. Then he shall bring his team home, clean them and give them\r\ntheir food, dine himself, and at four go back to his cattle and give\r\nthem more fodder, and getting into his barn make ready their food for\r\nnext day, not forgetting to see them again before going to his own\r\nsupper at six. After supper he is to mend shoes by the fireside for\r\nhimself and his family, or beat and knock hemp and flax, or pitch and\r\nstamp apples or crabs for cider or verjuice, or else grind malt, pick\r\ncandle-rushes, or 'do some husbandry office within doors till it\r\nbefall eight o'clock'. Then he shall take his lantern, visit his\r\ncattle once more, and go with all his household to rest. The farm\r\nroller of this time, according to Markham, was made of a round piece\r\nof wood 30 inches in circumference, 6 feet long, having at each end a\r\nstrong pin of iron to which shafts were made fast.[306] He mentions\r\nwooden and iron harrows, but this refers only to the tines, the wooden\r\nones being made of ash. From an illustration of a harrow which he\r\ngives, it appears it was much like Fitzherbert's and many used to-day:\r\na wooden frame, with the teeth set perhaps more closely than ours; the\r\nsingle harrow 4 feet square drawn by one horse, the double harrow 7\r\nfeet square by two oxen at least. Wheat he says, when the land is dug\r\n15 inches deep, and the seed dibbled in, will produce twelve times as\r\nmuch as when ploughed; but he admits the 'intricacy and trouble' of\r\nthis method.[307] As to the question of mowing or reaping corn, he is\r\nof opinion that though 'it is a custom in many countries of this\r\nkingdom not to sheare the wheat but to mow it, in my conceit it is not\r\nso good, for it both maketh the wheate foule and full of weede'.\r\nBarley, however, should be mown close to the ground, though many reap\r\nit; oats too were to be mown. His directions for planting an\r\norchard[308] are interesting, both as showing the kinds of fruit then\r\ngrown, the number of different sorts planted together, and the growth\r\nof the olive in England.[309] The orchard, he says, should be a\r\nsquare, divided into four quarters by alleys, and in the first quarter\r\nshould be apples of all sorts, in the second pears and wardens of all\r\nsorts, in the third quinces and chestnuts, in the fourth medlars and\r\nservices. A wall is the best fence, and on the north wall, 'against\r\nwhich the sunne reflects, you shall plant the abricot, verdochio,\r\npeache, and damaske plumbe; against the east side the white muskadine\r\ngrape, the pescod plumbe, and the Emperiale plumbe; against the west,\r\nthe grafted cherries and the olive tree; and against the south side\r\nthe almond and the figge tree.' As if this extraordinary mixture were\r\nnot enough, 'round about the skirts of the alleys' were to be planted\r\nplums, damsons, cherries, filberts and nuts of all sorts, and the\r\n'horse clog' and 'bulleye', the two latter being inferior wild plums.\r\nPlums were to be 5 feet apart, apples and other large fruit 12 feet.\r\n\r\nYoung trees should be watered morning and evening in dry summers, and\r\nold ones should have the earth dug away from the upper part of the\r\nroots from November to March, then the earth, mixed with dung or soap\r\nashes, replaced. Moss was carefully to be scraped off the trees with\r\nthe back of an old knife, and, to prevent it, the trees manured with\r\nswine's dung. Minute distinctions are given as to pruning and washing\r\nthe trees with strong brine of water and salt, either with a garden\r\npump placed in a tub or with 'squirtes which have many hoales', the\r\nforerunner of modern spraying.\r\n\r\nCider was then mostly made in the west, as in Devonshire and Cornwall,\r\nand perry in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire; but he leaves out\r\nHerefordshire, where it was certainly made at this time.[310]\r\n\r\nA curious help to fattening beasts, says Markham, is a lean horse or\r\ntwo kept with them, for the beasts delight to feed with them.\r\nFattening cattle were to have first bite at the pastures, then draught\r\ncattle, and then sheep; after Midsummer, when there is an\r\nextraordinary sweetness in the grass, suffer the cattle to eat the\r\ngrass closer till Lammas (August 1). Though some do not hold with him,\r\nhe thinks reading and writing not unprofitable to a husbandman, but\r\nnot much material 'to his bailiff'; for there is more trust in an\r\nhonest score chalked on a trencher than 'in a commen writen scrowle'.\r\nLandowners derived a good income from their woods and coppices. An\r\nacre of underwood of twenty-one years' growth, was at this time worth\r\nfrom £20 to £30; of twelve years' growth, £5 to £6; but on many of the\r\nbest lands it was only cut every thirty years.[311]\r\n\r\nIn 1742-3 oak timber was worth from 15d. to 18d. per cubic foot and\r\nash about 10d. During the Napoleonic war oak sold for 4s. 6d. a foot.\r\n\r\nIn Blyth's _Improver Improved_ we have one of the first accounts of\r\ncovered drains. The draining trench was to be made deep enough to go\r\nthe bottom of the 'cold spewing moist water' that feeds the flags and\r\nthe rushes; as for the width 'use thine own liberty' but be sure make\r\nit as straight as possible. The bottom was to be filled in with\r\nfaggots or stones to a depth of 15 inches, a method in some parts\r\nretained till comparatively modern times, with the top turf laid upon\r\nthem grass downward, and the drain filled in with the earth dug out of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nA country gentleman at this date could keep up a good establishment on\r\nan income which to-day would compel him to live economically in a\r\ncottage. From the accounts of Mr. Master, a landowner near\r\nChiselhurst, it appears that a man with an income of £300 or £400 a\r\nyear could live in some luxury, keep a stud of horses, and a\r\nconsiderable number of servants.[312] Some of them had no scruples\r\nabout adding to their incomes by turning corn-dealers, even selling\r\nsuch small quantities as pecks of peas, bushels of rye, and half pecks\r\nof oatmeal. From the accounts of one of them, Henry Best,[313] of\r\nElmswell, we learn many valuable details concerning farming in\r\nYorkshire about 1641. It was the custom to put the ram to the ewes\r\nabout October 18, but Best did so about Michaelmas, and generally used\r\none ram to 30 or 40 ewes, and he considered it necessary that the ewes\r\nshould be two-shear. 'Good handsome ewes', he says, could have been\r\nbought at Kilham fair for 3s. 6d. each, a price far below the average\r\nof the time. As for wages, mowers of grass had 10d. a day, and found\r\ntheir own food and their scythes, which cost them about 2s. 3d. each.\r\nHaymakers got 4d. a day, and had to 'meat themselves' and find their\r\nown forks and rakes. Shearers or reapers were paid from 8d. to 10d.,\r\nand found their own sickles; binders and stackers, 8d.; mowers of\r\n'haver', or oats, 10d., a good mower cutting 4 acres a day. In 1641 he\r\nsold oats for 14s. a quarter, best barley for 22s., rye 27s. 6d.,\r\nwheat 30s.[314] The roads were dreadful, and produce nearly all sent\r\nto market on pack-horses. 'Wee seldome send fewer than 8 horse loads\r\nto the market at a time, and with them two men, for one man cannot\r\nguide the poakes (sacks) of above four horses. When wee sende oats to\r\nthe market wee sack them up in 3 bushel poakes and lay 6 bushels on a\r\nhorse; when wee sende wheate, rye, or masseldene (rye and wheat) and\r\nbarley to market wee put it into mette poakes (2 bushel sacks),\r\nsometimes into half quarter sacks, and these we lay on horses that are\r\nshort coupled and well backed.' When the servants got to market they\r\nwere charged a halfpenny a horse for stabling and hay, but if they\r\ndined at the inn they paid nothing for their horses, and their dinners\r\ncost them 4d. a head. Butter was sold by the lb., or the 'cake' of 2\r\nlb., and in the beginning of Lent was 5d. a lb., by April 20, 3d., in\r\nthe middle of May, 2-1/2d. When William Pinder took 50 acres of land\r\n'of my Lord Haye' he paid a fine of £60 and a rent of £40; but this\r\nmust have been an extremely choice piece of land, for arable land\r\nrented apparently at less than 3s. an acre.[315] The rent of a cottage\r\nwas usually 10s. a year, 'though they have not so much as a yard or\r\nany backe side belonging to them.' There is more evidence, if such\r\nwere needed, of the beneficial effect of enclosure, which was said to\r\ntreble the value of pasture. Good meadow land fetched a great price:\r\n'The medow Sykes is about 5 acres of grounde, and was letten in the\r\nyear 1628 at £6 per annum, and in 1635 at £6 13s. 4d.\r\n\r\nThe requirements of a foreman on a farm were that he could sow, mow,\r\nstack peas, go well with 4 horses, and be accustomed to marketing; and\r\nfor this when hired by the year he received 5 marks, and perhaps half\r\na crown as earnest money. The next man got 50s., the next 46s. 6d.,\r\nthe fourth 35s. 'Christopher Pearson had the first year he dwelt here\r\n£3 5s. 0d. wages per annum and 5s. to a God's penny (earnest money);\r\nnext year he had £4 wages, and he was both a good seedsman,' before\r\nthe invention of drills a very valuable qualification, 'and did sow\r\nall our seed both the years. When you are about to hire a servant you\r\nare to call them aside and talk privately with them concerning their\r\nwage, and if the servants stand in the churchyard they usually call\r\nthem aside and walk to the back side of the church and there treat of\r\ntheir wage. I heard a servant asked what he could do, who made this\r\nanswer:\r\n\r\n     \"I can sowe,\r\n     I can mowe,\r\n     And I can stacke;\r\n     And I can doe\r\n     My master too\r\n     When my master turns his backe\".'\r\n\r\nIf we are to judge by the food provided for the thatchers, who were\r\nlittle better than ordinary labourers, the Yorkshire farm-hand fared\r\nwell on plenty of simple food, his three meals a day consisting of\r\nbutter, milk, cheese, and either eggs, pies, or bacon, sometimes\r\nporridge instead of milk.\r\n\r\nProbably, however, few country gentlemen were such industrious farmers\r\nas Best; many of them passed their days mostly in hunting and fowling\r\nand their evenings in drinking, though we know too that there were\r\nexceptions who did not care for this rude existence. Deer hunting, and\r\nwe must add deer poaching, was the great sport of the wealthy, but the\r\nsmaller gentry had to be content with simpler forms of the chase. For\r\nfox hunting each squire had his own little pack, and hunted only over\r\nhis own estate and those of his friends. He had also the otter, the\r\nbadger, and the hare to amuse him. Fowling was conducted, as in the\r\nMiddle Ages, by hawk or net, for the shot gun had not yet come into\r\nuse, and was forbidden by an old law.[316] The partridge and pheasant,\r\nas now, were the chief game birds. After the Restoration the country\r\ngentlemen seem to have been infected by the dissipation of the Court,\r\nand farming was left to the tenant farmer and yeoman: 'our gentry',\r\nsays Pepys, 'have grown ignorant of everything in good husbandry.'\r\n\r\nThe middle of the seventeenth century was the Golden Age of the\r\nyeoman who owned and farmed his land; even at the end of the Stuart\r\nperiod, when their decline had already begun, Gregory King estimated\r\ntheir numbers at 160,000 families, or about one-seventh of the\r\npopulation. The class included all those between the man who owned\r\nfreehold land worth 40s. a year and the wealthier yeoman who was\r\nhardly distinguishable from the small gentleman. Owning their own\r\nland they were a sturdy and independent class, and they 'took a jolly\r\npride in voting as in fighting on the opposite side of the\r\nneighbouring squire'. 'The yeomanry', wrote Fuller, 'is an estate of\r\npeople almost peculiar to England;' he 'wears russet clothes but\r\nmakes golden payment, having tin in his buttons and silver in his\r\npocket He seldom goes abroad, and his credit stretches farther than\r\nhis travel.' The tenant farmers were nearly as numerous, King\r\nestimating them at 150,000 families; economically they were about on\r\na level with the yeoman, their social standing, however, was\r\nconsiderably inferior.\r\n\r\nThe greatest improvement of the seventeenth century, the introduction\r\nfrom Holland of turnips and clover, was over-estimated by its author,\r\nSir Richard Weston; for he tells his sons that by sowing flax,\r\nturnips, and clover they might in five years improve 500 acres of poor\r\nland so as to bring in £7,000 a year.[317] To bring about this\r\ndesirable consummation, he provides his sons with accounts as to the\r\ncost, one of which shows the cost of growing an acre of flax and the\r\nprofit thereon, though this gentleman's estimates are clearly\r\noptimistic:\r\n\r\n                    DR.                          £   s.  d.\r\n\r\n  Devonshiring, i.e. paring and burning          1   0   0\r\n  Lime                                           0  12   0\r\n  Ploughing and harrowing                        0   6   0\r\n  3 bushels of seed                              2   0   0\r\n  Weeding                                        0   1   0\r\n  Pulling and binding                            0  10   0\r\n  Grassing the seed from the flax                0   6   0\r\n  Watering, drying, swinging, and beating        4  10   0\r\n                                                ----------\r\n                                                £9   5   0\r\n                                                ==========\r\n\r\n                    CR.                          £   s.  d.\r\n\r\n  900 lb. of flax                               40   0   0\r\n                                                 9   5   0\r\n                                               -----------\r\n                            Balance profit     £30  15   0\r\n                                               ===========\r\n\r\nTurnips were to come after flax, and were to be given to the cows as\r\nthey did in Flanders; that is, wash them clean, put them in a trough\r\nwhere they were to be stamped together with a spitter or small spade;\r\nand the turnips were to be followed by clover. All these, says Weston,\r\nwere already grown in England, but 'there is as much difference\r\nbetween what groweth here and there as is between the same thing which\r\ngroweth in a garden and that which groweth wild in the fields'.\r\nWorlidge soon after recommended that clover be sown on barley or oats\r\nabout the end of March or in April, and harrowed in, or by itself; and\r\nsays, with optimism equal to Weston's, one acre of clover will feed\r\nyou as many cows as 6 acres of ordinary grass and make the milk\r\nricher.[318]\r\n\r\nIt has been noticed that the price of wool altered little during the\r\ncentury, and from the private accounts of Sir Abel Barker[319] of\r\nHambleton, in the County of Rutland, we learn that in 1642 he sold his\r\nwool to his 'loving friend Mr. William Gladstone' for £1 a tod, though\r\nby 1648 it had gone up to 29s., a good price for those days. During\r\nthe Civil War some of Barker's horses were carried off for the service\r\nof the State, and he values them at £8 a piece, a fair price then.\r\nSome years later, for mowing 44 acres of grass he sets down in his\r\naccount £2 7s. 0d., for making the same £2 3s. 0d., and stacking it\r\n3s.\r\n\r\nSimon Hartlib, a Dutchman by birth and a friend of John Milton,\r\npublished his _Legacy_ in 1651, containing both rash statements and\r\nuseful information. We certainly cannot believe him when he states\r\nthat pasture employs more hands than tillage. His estimate of a good\r\ncrop of wheat was from 12 to 16 bushels per acre, and he speaks\r\nstrongly of the great fluctuations in prices, for he had known barley\r\nsell at Northampton at 6d. a bushel, and within 12 months at 5s., and\r\nwheat in London in one year varied from 3s. 6d. to 15s. a bushel. The\r\nenormous number of dovecotes was still a great nuisance, and the\r\npigeons were reckoned to eat 6,000,000 quarters of grain annually.\r\nHartlib recommends his countrymen to sow 'a seed commonly called Saint\r\nFoine, which in England is as much as to say Holy Hay,' as they do in\r\nFrance: especially on barren lands, advice which some of them\r\nfollowed, and in Wilts., soon after, sainfoin is said to have so\r\nimproved poor land that from a noble (6s. 8d.) per acre, the rent had\r\nincreased to 30s.[320] They were also to use 'another sort of fodder\r\nwhich they call La Lucern at Paris for dry and barren grounds'. So\r\nwasteful were they of labour in some parts that in Kent were to be\r\nseen 12 horses and oxen drawing one plough.[321]\r\n\r\nThe use of the spade was long looked askance at by English husbandmen;\r\nold men in Surrey had told Hartlib that they knew the first gardeners\r\nthat came into those parts to plant cabbages and 'colleflowers', and\r\nto sow turnips, carrots, and parsnips, and that they gave £8 an acre\r\nfor their land. The latter statement must be an exaggeration, as it is\r\nequivalent to a rent of about £40 in our money; but we may give some\r\ncredence to him when he says that the owner was anxious lest the spade\r\nshould spoil his ground, 'so ignorant were we of gardening in those\r\ndays.' Though it was not the case in Elizabeth's time, by now the\r\nlicorice, saffron, cherries, apples, pears, hops, and cabbages of\r\nEngland were the best in the world; but many things were deficient,\r\nfor instance, many onions came from Flanders and Spain, madder from\r\nZealand, and roses from France.[322] 'It is a great deficiency in\r\nEngland that we have not more orchards planted. It is true that in\r\nKent, and about London, and in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and\r\nWorcestershire[323] there are many gallant orchards, but in other\r\ncountry places they are very rare and thin, I know in Kent some\r\nadvance their ground from 5s. per acre to £5 by this means', and 30\r\nacres of cherries near Sittingbourne had realized £1,000 in one year.\r\nHis recipe for making old fruit trees bear well savours of a time\r\nwhen old women were still burnt as witches. 'First split his root,\r\nthen apply a compost of pigeon's dung, lees of wine, or stale wine,\r\nand a little brimstone'. The tithes of wine in Gloucestershire were\r\n'in divers parishes considerably great', and wine was then made in\r\nKent and Surrey, notably by Sir Peter Ricard, who made 6 or 8\r\nhogsheads yearly.[324] There is no doubt that the vine has been grown\r\nin the open in England from very early times until comparatively\r\nrecent ones. The Britons were taught to plant it by the Romans in A.D.\r\n280.[325] In Domesday there are 38 examples of vineyards, chiefly in\r\nthe south central counties. Neckham, who wrote in the twelfth century,\r\nsays the vineyard was an important adjunct to the mediaeval\r\nmansion.[326] William of Malmesbury praised the vines and wine of\r\nGloucestershire; and says that the vine was either allowed to trail on\r\nthe ground, or trained to small stakes fixed to each plant. Indeed,\r\nthe mention of them in mediaeval chronicles is frequent.\r\n\r\nTwo bushels of green grapes in 1332 fetched 7s. 6d.[327] Richard II\r\nplanted vines in great plenty, according to Stow, within the upper\r\npark of Windsor, and sold some part to his people. The wine made in\r\nEngland was sweetened with honey, and probably flavoured and coloured\r\nwith blackberries.[328] At the dissolution of the monasteries there\r\nwas a vineyard at Barking Nunnery. 'We might have a reasonable good\r\nwine growing in many places of this realme', says Barnaby Googe, about\r\n1577, 'as doubtless we had immediately after the Conquest, tyll,\r\npartly by slothfulnesse, partly by civil discord long continued, it\r\nwas left, and so with time lost.... There is besides Nottingham an\r\nancient house called Chylwel in which remaineth yet as an ancient\r\nmonument in a great wyndowe of glasse, the whole order of planting,\r\nproyning, stamping, and pressing of vines. Upon many cliffes and hills\r\nare yet to be seen the rootes and old remaines of vines.' Plot, in his\r\n_Natural History of Staffordshire_,[329] says 'the vine has been\r\nimproved by Sir Henry Lyttelton at Over (Upper) Arley, which is\r\nsituate low and warm, so that he has made wine there undistinguishable\r\nfrom the best French by the most judicious palates, but this I suppose\r\nwas done only in some over hot summer, and Dr. Bathurst made very good\r\nclaret at Oxon in 1685, a very mean year for the purpose.' In 1720 the\r\nfamous vineyard at Bath of 6 acres, planted with the 'white muscadene'\r\nand the 'black Chester grape,' produced 66 hogsheads of wine worth £10\r\na hogshead, but in unfavourable years grew very little.'[330] Mr.\r\nPeter Collinson, writing from Middlesex in 1747, says, 'the vineyards\r\nturn to good profit, much wine being made this year in England;' and\r\nagain in 1748, 'my vineyards are very ripe; a considerable quantity of\r\nwine will this year be made in England.'[331] However, the attempt\r\nmade to grow vines on the undercliff at Ventnor at the end of the\r\neighteenth century by Sir Richard Worsley ended in dismal failure, and\r\nit is probable that the English climate in its normal years seldom\r\nproduced good grapes out of doors whatever it may have done in\r\nexceptionally hot ones, unless we assume that it has changed\r\nconsiderably, for which there is little ground.\r\n\r\nHartlib was no friend of commons; they made the poor idle and trained\r\nthem for the gallows or beggary, and there were fewest poor where\r\nthere were fewest commons,[332] as in Kent--a statement re-echoed by\r\nmany observant writers; he also recommends enclosures, because they\r\ngave warmth and consequent fertility to the soil. He tells us that an\r\neffort had been made by James I to encourage the growth of mulberry\r\ntrees and the breeding of silkworms, the lords-lieutenant of the\r\ndifferent counties being urged to see to it, but it had little\r\neffect.[333]\r\n\r\nThe number of different sorts of wheat was by this time considerable.\r\nHartlib gives the white, red, bearded ('which is not subject to\r\nmildews as others'); some sorts with two rows, others with four and\r\nsix; some with one ear on a stalk, others with two; the red stalk\r\nwheat of Bucks; winter wheat and summer wheat. There were also twenty\r\nvarieties of peas that he knew, and the white, black, naked. Scotch,\r\nand Poland oats. Markham adds the whole straw wheat, the great brown\r\npollard, the white pollard, the organ, the flaxen, and the chilter\r\nwheat.\r\n\r\nThere was a sad lack of enterprise in the breeding of stock now and\r\nfor many generations before; indeed, it may be doubted if this\r\nimportant branch of farming, except perhaps in the case of sheep, was\r\nmuch attended to until the time of Bakewell and the Collings. In\r\nElizabeth's time a Frenchman had twitted England with having only\r\n3,000 or 4,000 horses worth anything, which was one of the reasons\r\nthat induced the Spaniards to invade us.[334] 'We are negligent, too,\r\nin our kine, that we advance not the best species.'\r\n\r\nThe size of cattle at this date, however, seems to have been greater\r\nthan is often stated. The Report of the Select Committee on the\r\nCultivation of Waste Lands in 1795, states that the average weight,\r\ndressed, of cattle at Smithfield in 1710 was only 370 lb.,[335] yet\r\nthe Household Book of Prince Henry at the commencement of the\r\nseventeenth century says that an ox should weigh 600 lb. the four\r\nquarters, and cost about £9 10s., a sheep about 45 lb., so that the\r\nlatter were apparently relatively smaller than the oxen. In 1603 oxen\r\nwere sold at Tostock in Suffolk weighing 1,000 lb. apiece, dead\r\nweight.[336] According to the records of Winchester College, the oxen\r\nsold there in the middle of the century averaged, dressed, about 575\r\nlb.; in 1677, 35 oxen sold there averaged 730 lb. 'Some kine,' it was\r\nsaid at the end of the century, 'have grown to be very bulky and a\r\ngreat many are sold for £10 or £12 apiece; there was lately sold near\r\nBury a beast for £30, and 'twas fatted with cabbage leaves. An ox near\r\nRipon weighed, dressed, 13-1/4 cwt.'[337] They were, of course,\r\nchiefly valued as beasts of draught, and no doubt the one Evelyn saw\r\nin 1649, 'bred in Kent, 17 foot in length, and much higher than I\r\ncould reach,' was a powerful animal for this purpose. The young ones\r\nwere taught to draw by yoking two of them, together with two old ones\r\nbefore and two behind, with a man on each side the young ones, 'to\r\nkeep them in order and speak them fair,' for if much beaten they\r\nseldom did well: for the first two or three days they were worked only\r\nthree or four hours a day, but soon they worked as long as the older\r\nones, that is from 6 to 11, then a bait of hay and rest till 1, with\r\nwork again till 5, at least in Lancashire. They were kept in the yoke\r\ntill nine or ten years old, then turned on to the best grass in May,\r\nand sold to the butcher.[338]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[286] _Surveyor's Dialogue_ (ed. 1608), p. 2.\r\n\r\n[287] _Surveyor's Dialogue_, p. 188.\r\n\r\n[288] Ibid. p. 207.\r\n\r\n[289] _Victoria County History: Devon, Agriculture_.\r\n\r\n[290] _Herefordshire Orchards a Pattern for All England_ (ed. 1724).\r\n\r\n[291] See infra, p. 136.\r\n\r\n[292] These extracts are from the original edition in the Bodleian\r\nLibrary.\r\n\r\n[293] 'The Flanders cherry excels', says Worlidge, _Syst.

Dymock, Hartlib's contemporary, questions 'whether\r\ncommons do not rather make poore by causing idlenesse than maintaine\r\nthem;' and he also asks how it is that there are fewest poor where\r\nthere are fewest commons.\r\n\r\nIn the common fields, too, there was continual strife and contention\r\ncaused by the infinite number of trespasses that they were subject\r\nto.[339] The absence of hedges, too, in these great open fields was\r\nbad for the crops, for there was nothing to mitigate drying and\r\nscorching winds, while in the open waste and meadows the live stock\r\nmust have sadly needed shelter and shade, 'losing more flesh in one\r\nhot day than they gained in three cool days.' Worlidge, a Hampshire\r\nman, joins in the chorus of praise of enclosures, for they brought\r\nemployment to the poor, and maintained treble 'the number of\r\ninhabitants' that the open fields did; and he gives further proof of\r\nthe enclosure of land in the seventeenth century, when he mentions\r\n'the great quantities of land that have within our memories lain open,\r\nand in common of little value, yet when enclosed have proved excellent\r\ngood land.' Why then was this most obvious improvement not more\r\ngenerally effected? Because there was a great impediment to it in the\r\nnumerous interests and diversity of titles and claims to almost every\r\ncommon field and piece of waste land in England, whereby one or more\r\nenvious or ignorant persons could thwart the will of the\r\nmajority.[340] Another hindrance, he says, was that many roads passed\r\nover the commons and wastes, which a statute was needed to stop.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century hop growing was not nearly so common in\r\nEngland as in the preceding, when Harrison had said, in his\r\n_Description of Britain_, 'there are few farmers or occupiers in the\r\ncountry which have not gardens and hops growing of their own, and\r\nthose far better than do come from Flanders.' There seems, indeed, to\r\nhave been a prejudice against the hop; Worlidge[341] says it was\r\nesteemed an unwholesome herb for the use it was usually put to, 'which\r\nmay also be supplied with several other wholesome and better herbs.'\r\nJohn Evelyn was very much against them, probably because he was such\r\nan advocate of cider: 'It is little more than an age,' he says, 'since\r\nhopps transmuted our wholesome ale into beer, which doubtless much\r\naltered our constitutions. That one ingredient, by some not unworthily\r\nsuspected, preserving drink indeed, and so by custom made agreeable,\r\nyet repaying the pleasure with tormenting diseases, and a shorter\r\nlife, may deservedly abate our fondness for it, especially if with\r\nthis be considered likewise the casualties in planting it, as seldom\r\nsucceeding more than once in three years.'[342] The City of London\r\npetitioned against hops as spoiling the taste of drink.\r\n\r\nYet its cultivation is said to have advanced the price of land to £40,\r\n£50, and sometimes £100 an acre, the latter an almost incredible price\r\nif we consider the value of money then. There were not enough planted\r\nto serve the kingdom, and Flemish hops had to be imported, though not\r\nnearly so good as English. A great deal of dishonesty, moreover, was\r\nshown by the foreign importers, so that in 1603 a statute (1 Jac. I,\r\nc. 18) was passed against the 'false packinge of forreine hops,' by\r\nwhich it appears that the sacks were filled up with leaves, stalks,\r\npowder, sand, straw, wood, and even soil, for increasing the weight,\r\nby which English growers it is said lost £20,000 a year. Such hops\r\nwere to be forfeited, and brewers using them were to forfeit their\r\nvalue. The chief cause of their decrease was that few farmers would\r\ntake the trouble and care required to grow them, in spite of the often\r\nexcellent prices, which at Winchester at this date averaged from 50s.\r\nto 80s. a cwt., sometimes, however, reaching over 200s., as in 1665\r\nand 1687, though then as now they were subject to great fluctuations,\r\nand in 1691 were only 31s. Many, too, were discouraged by the fact\r\n'they are the most of any plant that grows subject to the various\r\nmutations of the air, mildews sometimes totally destroying them,' no\r\ndoubt an allusion to the aphis blight. Hop yards were often protected\r\nat this early date by hedges of tall trees, usually ash or poplar, the\r\nelm being disapproved of as contracting mildews. Markham[343] says\r\nthat Hertfordshire then contained as good hops as he had seen\r\nanywhere, and there the custom was 250 hills to every rood, 'and every\r\nhill will bear 2-1/2 lb., worth on an average 4 nobles a cwt. (a noble\r\n= 6s. 8d.);' hills were to be 6 ft. apart at least, poles 16 to 18 ft.\r\nlong and 9 or 10 inches in circumference at the butt, of ash, oak,\r\nbeech, alder, maple or willow.\r\n\r\nSome planted the hills in 'plain squares chequerwise, which is the\r\nbest way if you intend to plough with horses between the hills. Others\r\nplant them in form of a quincunx, which is better for the hop, and\r\nwill do very well where your ground is but small that you may overcome\r\nit with either the breast plough or spade.' The manure recommended by\r\nWorlidge was good mould, or dung and earth mixed. The hills were like\r\nmole-hills 3 feet high, and sometimes were large enough to have as\r\nmany as 20 poles, so that some hop yards must have looked very\r\ndifferent then from what they do now, even when poles are retained;\r\nbut from two to five poles per hill was the more usual number.\r\nCultivation was much the same as in Reynold Scott's time, and picking\r\nwas still done on a 'floor' prepared by levelling the hills, watering,\r\ntreading, and sweeping the ground, round which the pickers sat and\r\npicked into baskets, but the hop crib was also used.\r\n\r\nIt was considered better not to let the hops get too ripe, as the\r\ngrowers were aware of the value of a fresh, green-looking sample; and\r\nWorlidge advises the careful exclusion of leaves and stalks, though\r\nMarkham does not agree with him. Kilns were of two sorts: the English\r\nkiln made of wood, lath, and clay; the French of brick, lime, and\r\nsand, not so liable to burn as the former and therefore better.[344]\r\nOne method of drying was finely to bed the kiln with wheat straw laid\r\non the hair-cloth, the hops being spread 8 inches thick over this,\r\n'and then you shall keepe a fire a little more fervent than for the\r\ndrying of a kiln full of malt,' the fire not to be of wood, for that\r\nmade the hops smoky and tasted the beer, but of straw! Worlidge,\r\nstrangely, recommended the bed of the kiln to be covered with tin, as\r\nmuch better than hair-cloth, for then any sort of fuel would do as\r\nwell as charcoal, since the smoke did not pass through the hops.\r\n\r\nBesides Hertfordshire, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, Leicestershire,\r\nand Rutlandshire; Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire were recommended by\r\nMarkham for hop growing, the great hop counties of to-day being passed\r\nover by him.\r\n\r\nThe growth of hemp and flax had by this time considerably decayed,\r\nowing to the want of encouragement to trade in these commodities, the\r\nlack of experience in growing them, and the tithes which in some years\r\namounted to more than the profits.[345] An acre of good flax was worth\r\nfrom £7 to £12; but if 'wrought up fit to sell in the market' from £15\r\nto £20.\r\n\r\nWoad was considered a 'very rich commodity', but according to Blyth it\r\nrobbed the land if long continued upon it, although if moderately used\r\nit prepared land for corn, drawing a 'different juice from what the\r\ncorn requires'. It more than doubled the rent of land, and had been\r\nsold at from £6 to £20 a ton, the produce of an acre. John Lawrence,\r\nwho wrote in the first quarter of the eighteenth century, says woad\r\nwas in his time cultivated by companies of people, men, women, and\r\nchildren, who hired the land, built huts, and grew and prepared the\r\ncrop for the dyer's use, then moved on to another place.[346]\r\n\r\nThere were proofs that man's inventive genius was at work among farm\r\nimplements. Worlidge mentions[347] an engine for setting corn,\r\ninvented by Gabriel Plat, made of two boards bored with wide holes 4\r\nin. apart, set in a frame, with a funnel to each hole. It was fitted\r\nwith iron pins 5 in. long to 'play up and down', and dibble holes into\r\nwhich the corn was to go from the funnels. This machine was so\r\nintricate and clumsy that Worlidge found no use for it. However, he\r\nrecommends another instrument which certainly seems to anticipate\r\nTull's drill, though Tull is said to have stated when Bradley showed\r\nhim a cut of it that it was only a proposal and it never got farther\r\nthan the cut.[348] It consisted of a frame of small square pieces of\r\ntimber 2 inches thick; the breadth of the frame 2 feet, the height 18\r\ninches, length 4 feet, placed on four good-sized wheels. In the middle\r\nof the frame a coulter was fixed to make a furrow for the corn, which\r\nfell through a wooden pipe behind, that dropped the corn out of a\r\nhopper containing about a bushel, the fall of the corn from the hopper\r\nbeing regulated by a wooden wheel in its neck. The same frame might\r\ncontain two coulters, pipes, and hoppers, and the instrument could be\r\nworked with one horse and one man. It was considered a great advance\r\non sowing broadcast, and by the use of it 'you may also cover your\r\ngrain with any rich compost you shall prepare for that purpose, either\r\nwith pigeon dung, dry or granulated, or any other saline or lixirial\r\n(alkaline, or of potash) substance, which may drop after the corn from\r\nanother hopper behind the one that drops the corn, or from a separate\r\ndrill'. The corn thus sown in rows was found easier to weed and hoe,\r\nso that it is clear that this advantage was well understood before\r\nTull's time.\r\n\r\nThere was a great diversity of ploughs at this date, almost every\r\ncounty having some variation.[349] The principal sorts were the\r\ndouble-wheel plough, useful upon hard land, usually drawn with horses\r\nor oxen two abreast, the wheels 18 in. to 20 in. high. The one-wheel\r\nplough, which could be used on almost any sort of land; it was very\r\n'light and nimble', so that it could be drawn by one horse and held by\r\none man, and thus ploughed an acre a day.\r\n\r\nThen there was a 'plain plough without either wheel or foot', very\r\neasy to work and fit for any lands; a double plough worked by four\r\nhorses and two men, of two kinds, one ploughing a double furrow, the\r\nother a double depth.\r\n\r\nThere were also ploughs with a harrow attached, others constructed to\r\nplough, sow, and harrow, but not of much value; and a turfing plough\r\nfor burning sod. Carts and waggons were of many sorts, according to\r\nthe locality, the greater wheels of the waggon being usually 18 feet\r\nin circumference the lesser 9 feet. A useful implement was the\r\ntrenching plough used on grass land to cut out the sides of trenches\r\nor drains, with a long handle and beam and with a coulter or knife\r\nfixed in it and sometimes a wheel or wheels. The following is a list\r\nof other implements then considered necessary for a farm.\r\n\r\n  _For the field._\r\n\r\n    Harrows          Mole spear        Beetles\r\n    Forks            Mole traps        Roller\r\n    Sickles          Weedhooks         Cradle scythe\r\n    Reaphooks        Pitchforks        Seedlip[350]\r\n    Sledds           Rakes\r\n\r\n  _For the barn and stable._\r\n\r\n    Flails           Pannels (pillions)   Pails\r\n    Winnowing fan    Pack-saddles         Mane combs\r\n    Sieves           Cart lines           Goads\r\n    Sacks            Ladders              Yokes\r\n    Bins             Corn measures        Wanteyes[351]\r\n    Curry combs      Brooms               Suffingles (surcingles?)\r\n    Whips            Skeps (baskets)      Screens for corn.\r\n    Harness\r\n\r\n  _For the meadows and pastures._\r\n\r\n    Scythes          Pitchforks           Cutting spade for hayrick\r\n    Rakes            Fetters and clogs    Horse-locks.\r\n                     Besides many tools.\r\n\r\nA considerable variety of manures were in use, chalk, lime, marl,\r\nfuller's earth, clay, sand, sea-weed, river-weed, oyster shells, fish,\r\ndung, ashes, soot, salt, rags, hair, malt dust, bones, horns, and the\r\nbark of trees. Of the oyster shells Worlidge says, 'I am credibly\r\ninformed that an ingenious gentleman living near the seaside laid on\r\nhis lands great quantities, which made his neighbours laugh at him (as\r\nusually they do at anything besides their own clownish road or custom\r\nof ignorance),' and after a year or two's exposure to the weather\r\n'they exceedingly enriched his land for many years after.' The bones\r\nthen used were marrow-bones and fish bones, or 'whatever hath any\r\noiliness or fatness in it', but the bones of horses and other animals\r\nwere also used, burnt before being applied to the land, crushing not\r\nbeing thought of till many years after.\r\n\r\nIn 1688 Gregory King,[352] who was much more accurate than most\r\nstatisticians of his time, gave the following estimate of the land of\r\nEngland and Wales:--\r\n\r\n                                   Acres.

The tenant farmer with a\r\nfamily of 5, only saved 25s. a year, while labouring families who, he\r\nsaid, averaged 3-1/2 (certainly an under estimate), lost annually 7s.,\r\nand cottagers and paupers with families of 3-1/4 (also an under\r\nestimate) lost 16s. 3d. a year. It will thus be seen that the tenant\r\nfarmers, labourers, and cottagers, the bulk of those who worked on the\r\nland, were very badly off; the tenant farmer saved considerably less\r\nthan the artisan. It will also be noticed that the rural population of\r\nEngland was about three-quarters of the whole.[354]\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1683-4 was marked by one of the severest frosts that\r\nhave ever visited England. Ice on the Thames is said to have been\r\neleven inches thick; by Jan. 9 there were streets of booths on it; and\r\nby the 24th, the frost continuing more and more severe, all sorts of\r\nshops and trades flourished on the river, 'even to a printing press,\r\nwhere the people and ladies took a fancy to have their names printed\r\nand the day and year set down when printed on the Thames.' Coaches\r\nplied, there was bull-baiting, horse and coach races, puppet plays and\r\ninterludes, tippling 'and other lewd places'--a regular carnival on\r\nthe water.[355] Altogether the frost which began at Christmas lasted\r\nninety-one days and did much damage on land, many of the trees were\r\nsplit as if struck by lightning, and men and cattle perished in some\r\nparts. Poultry and other birds and many plants and vegetables also\r\nperished. Wheat, however, was little affected, as the average price\r\nwas under 40s. a quarter. In 1692 a series of very bad seasons\r\ncommenced, lasting, with a break in 1694, until 1698, always known as\r\nthe 'ill' or 'barren' seasons, and the cause was the usual one in\r\nEngland, excessive cold and wet. In 1693 wheat was over 60s. a\r\nquarter, and in Kent turnips were made into bread for the poor.[356]\r\nThe difference in the price of farm produce in various localities was\r\nstriking, and an eloquent testimony to the wretched means of\r\ncommunication. At Newark, for instance, in 1692-3 wheat was from 36s.\r\nto 40s. a quarter, while at Brentford it touched 76s.; next year in\r\nthe same two places it was 32s. and 86s. respectively. In 1695-6 hay\r\nat Newark was 13s. 4d. a ton, at Northampton it was from 35s. to 40s.\r\n\r\nIn 1662 was passed the famous statute of parochial settlement, 14 Car.\r\nII, c. 12, which forged cruel fetters for the poor, and is said to\r\nhave caused the iron of slavery to enter into the soul of the English\r\nlabourer.[357] The Act states, that the reason for passing it was the\r\ncontinual increase of the poor throughout the kingdom, which had\r\nbecome exceeding burdensome owing to the defects in the law. Poor\r\npeople, moreover, wandered from one parish to another in order 'to\r\nsettle where there is the best Stocke, the largest commons or wastes\r\nto build cotages, and the most woods for them to burn and\r\ndestroy.'[358] It was therefore determined to stop these wanderings,\r\nand most effectually was it done. Two justices were empowered to\r\nremove any person who settled in any tenement under the yearly value\r\nof £10 within forty days to the place where he was last legally\r\nsettled, unless he gave sufficient security for the discharge of the\r\nparish in case he became a pauper.\r\n\r\nIt is true that certain relaxations were subsequently made. The Act of\r\n1691, 3 W. & M., c. 2, allowed derivative settlements on payment of\r\ntaxes for one year, serving an annual office, hiring for a year, and\r\napprenticeship; while the Act of 1696, 8 & 9 Wm. III, c. 30, allowed\r\nthe grant of a certificate of settlement, under which safeguard the\r\nholder could migrate to a district where his labour was required, the\r\nnew parish being assured he would not become chargeable to it, and\r\ntherefore not troubling to remove him till there was actual need: but\r\nthe statute acted as an effectual check on migration and prevented the\r\nlabourer carrying his work where it was wanted.[359] It became the\r\nobject of parishes to have as few cottages and therefore as few poor\r\nas possible. In 'close' parishes, i.e. where all the land belonged to\r\none owner, as distinguished from 'open' ones where it belonged to\r\nseveral, all the cottages were often pulled down so that labourers\r\ncoming to work in it had to travel long distances in all weathers. We\r\nshall see further relaxation in the law in 1795, but it was not until\r\nmodern times that this abominable system was destroyed. The\r\nagricultural labourer's difficulty in building a house was aggravated\r\nby the statute 31 Eliz., c. 7, before noticed, which in order to\r\nrestrain the building of cottages enacted that none, except in towns\r\nand certain other places, were to be built unless 4 acres of land were\r\nattached to them, under a penalty of £10, and 40s. a month for\r\ncontinuing to maintain it. This Act was not repealed until the reign\r\nof George III. However, it seems to have been frequently winked at. In\r\nShropshire, for instance, the fine often was only nominal; in the\r\nseventeenth century orders authorizing the building of cottages on the\r\nwaste were freely given by the Court of Quarter Sessions, and orders\r\nwere also made by the Court for the erection of cottages\r\nelsewhere.[360]\r\n\r\nAt the restoration of Charles II the corn laws had practically been\r\nunaltered since 1571,[361] when it had been enacted that corn might be\r\nexported from certain ports in certain ships at all times when\r\nproclamation was not made to the contrary, on a payment of 12d. a\r\nquarter on wheat and 8d. a quarter on other grain. Now both export and\r\nimport were subjected to heavy duties, but these caused such high\r\nprices in corn that they were reduced in 1663; yet high duties were\r\nagain imposed in 1673, which continued until the revolution. Then,\r\nowing to good crops and low prices, which brought distress on the\r\nlanded interest, a new policy was introduced: export duties were\r\nabolished and the other extreme resorted to, viz. a bounty on export\r\nof 5s. in the quarter as long as the home price did not exceed 48s. At\r\nthe same time import duties remained high, and this system lasted till\r\n1773. Never had the corn-growers of England been so thoroughly\r\nprotected, yet, owing to causes over which the legislators had no\r\ncontrol, namely bountiful seasons, the prices of wheat for the next\r\nseventy years was from 15 to 20 per cent. cheaper than in the previous\r\nforty. Modern economists have described this system as one of the\r\nworst instances of a class using their legislative power to subsidize\r\nthemselves at the expense of the community. As a matter of fact it was\r\nthe firm conviction of the statesmen and economists of the time, that\r\nhusbandry, being the main industry and prop of England, and the\r\nfoundation on which the whole political power of the country was\r\nbased, should receive every encouragement. At all events, in many ways\r\nthe policy was successful.[362] It encouraged investment in land, and\r\nmaterially assisted the agricultural improvement for which the\r\neighteenth century was noted, the export too employed English\r\nshipping, and thus aided industry. Arthur Young said it was the\r\nsingular felicity of this country to have devised a plan which\r\naccomplished the strange paradox of at once lowering the price of corn\r\nand encouraging agriculture, for by the system in vogue till 1773 if\r\ncorn was scarce it was imported, while if there was a glut at home\r\nexport was assisted so that great fluctuations in price were\r\nprevented.[363] It seemed of the utmost importance to men of that time\r\nthat England should be self-supporting and independent of possible\r\nadversaries for the necessaries of life; the wisdom of the policy was\r\nnever questioned, and was accepted by statesmen of every party.[364]\r\nTo blame the landowners for adopting what seemed the wisest course to\r\nevery sensible person is merely an instance of partisan spite.\r\n\r\nAt the Peace of Paris in 1763 the question as to whether England or\r\nFrance was to be the great colonizing country of the world was finally\r\nsettled, and a great development of English trade ensued. It was\r\naccompanied by a great increase of population, exports of corn were\r\nlargely reduced, and the balance began to incline the other way, so\r\nthat the next Act of importance was that of 1773 which permitted the\r\nimport of foreign wheat at a nominal duty of 6d. a quarter when it was\r\nover 48s., but prohibited export and the bounty on export when wheat\r\nwas at or above 44s. This was the nearest approach to free trade\r\nbefore 1846.\r\n\r\nThe time, however, was not yet ripe for this, and the nominal duty on\r\nimports was too small for landlords and farmers, so that in 1791 the\r\nprice when the same nominal duty was to come into force was raised to\r\n54s., while between 50s. and 54s. a duty of 2s. 6d. was imposed, and\r\nunder 50s. a duty of 24s. 3d.; and export was allowed without bounty\r\nwhen wheat was under 46s. Export of corn, however, by this time had\r\nbecome a matter of little moment, England having definitely ceased to\r\nbe an exporting country after 1789.\r\n\r\nNot only were English landowners after the Restoration anxious to\r\nprotect their corn, but they also took alarm at the imports of Irish\r\ncattle which they said lowered English rents, so that in 1665 and 1680\r\n(18 Car. II, c. 2, and 32 Car. II, c. 2) laws were framed absolutely\r\nprohibiting the import of Irish cattle, sheep, and swine, as well as\r\nof beef, pork, bacon, and mutton, and even butter and cheese. The\r\nstatute 12 Car. II, c. 4, also virtually excluded Irish wool from\r\nEngland by duties amounting to prohibition. It was not until 1759 that\r\nfree imports of cattle from Ireland were allowed for five years,[365]\r\na period prolonged by 5 Geo. III, c. 10, and a statute of 1772.\r\n\r\nIn 1699 wool was allowed to be shipped from six specified ports in\r\nIreland to eight specified ports in England,[366] and by 16 Geo. II,\r\nc. 11, wool might be sent from Ireland to any port in England under\r\ncertain restrictions.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[339] Worlidge, _Systema Agriculturae_ (ed. 1669), p. 10.\r\n\r\n[340] Ibid. p. 124.\r\n\r\n[341] Ibid. p. 124.\r\n\r\n[342] _Pomona_ (ed. 1664), p. 1.\r\n\r\n[343] Ed. 1635, Book i, p. 175.\r\n\r\n[344] Markham, _op. cit._ i. 188.\r\n\r\n[345] Worlidge, _Systema Agriculturae_, p. 38.

It first saw the application of\r\ncapital in large quantities to farming, the improvements of the time\r\nbeing largely initiated by rich landowners whom Young praises rightly\r\nas public-spirited men who deserved well of their country, though\r\nThorold Rogers attributes a meaner motive for the improvement of their\r\nestates, namely, their desire not to be outshone by the wealthy\r\nmerchants.[367] They were often ably assisted by tenant farmers, many\r\nof whom were now men with considerable capital, for whom the smaller\r\nfarms were amalgamated into large ones. After the agricultural\r\nrevolution of the latter half of the century, the tendency to\r\nconsolidate small holdings into large farms grew apace and was looked\r\non as a decided mark of progress. This agricultural revolution was\r\nlargely a result of the industrial revolution that then took place in\r\nEngland. Owing to mechanical inventions and the consequent growth of\r\nthe factory system, the great manufacturing towns arose, whence came a\r\ngreat demand for food, and, to supply this demand, farms, instead of\r\nbeing small self-sufficing holdings just growing enough for the\r\nfarmer and his family and servants, grew larger, and became\r\nmanufactories of corn and meat. The century was also remarkable for\r\nanother great change. England, hitherto an exporting country, became\r\nan importing one. The progress of the century was furthered by a band\r\nof men whose names are, or ought to be, household words with English\r\nfarmers: Jethro Tull, Lord Townshend, Arthur Young, Bakewell, Coke of\r\nHolkham, and the Collings. Further the century witnessed a great\r\nnumber of enclosures, especially when it was drawing to its close.\r\nAccording to the Report of the Committee on Waste Lands in 1797, the\r\nnumber of Enclosure Acts was: under Anne, 2 Acts, enclosing 1,439\r\nacres; under Geo. I, 16 Acts, enclosing 17,960 acres; under Geo. II,\r\n226 Acts, enclosing 318,778 acres; from 1760 to 1797, 1,532 Acts,\r\nenclosing 2,804,197 acres.\r\n\r\nThe period from 1700 to 1765 has been called the golden age of the\r\nagricultural classes, as the fifteenth century has been called the\r\ngolden age of the labourer, but the farmer and landlord were often\r\nhard pressed; rates were low, wages were fair, and the demand for the\r\nproduce of the farm constant owing to the growth of the population,\r\nyet prices for wheat, stock, and wool were often unremunerative to the\r\nfarmer, and we are told in 1734, 'necessity has compelled our farmers\r\nto more carefulness and frugality in laying out their money than they\r\nwere accustomed to in better times.'[368] The labourer's wages varied\r\naccording to locality. The assessment of wages by the magistrates in\r\nLancashire for 1725 remains, and according to that the ordinary\r\nlabourer earned 10d. a day in the summer and 9d. in the winter months,\r\nwith extras in harvest, and this may be taken as the average pay at\r\nthat date. Threshing and winnowing wheat by piece-work cost 2s. a\r\nquarter, oats 1s. a quarter. Making a ditch 4 feet wide at the top, 18\r\ninches wide at the bottom, and 3 feet deep, double set with quicks,\r\ncost 1s. a rood (8 yards), 10d. if without the quick.[369] The\r\nmagistrates remarked in their proclamation on the plenty of the times\r\nand were afraid that for the northern part of the county, which was\r\nthen very backward, the wages were too liberal. Wheat was,\r\nunfortunately, that year 46s. 1d. a quarter, but a few years before\r\nand after that date it was cheap--20s., 24s., 28s. a quarter--and\r\nfresh meat was only 3d. a lb., so that their wages went a long\r\nway.[370] A considerable portion of the wages was paid in kind, not\r\nonly in drink but in food, though this custom became less frequent as\r\nthe century went on.[371]\r\n\r\nAs for his food, Eden tells us[372] that the diet of Bedford workhouse\r\nin 1730 was much better than that of the most industrious labourer in\r\nhis own home, and this was the diet: bread and cheese or broth for\r\nbreakfast, boiled beef hot or cold, sometimes with suet pudding for\r\ndinner, and bread and cheese or broth for supper. This must have been\r\nsufficiently monotonous, and we may be sure the labourer at home very\r\nseldom had boiled beef for dinner; but in the north he was much\r\ncleverer than his southern brother in cooking cereal foods such as\r\noatmeal porridge, crowdie (also of oatmeal), frumenty or barley milk,\r\nbarley broth, &c.[373]\r\n\r\nThe village of the first half of the eighteenth century contained a\r\nmuch better graded society than the village of to-day. It had few\r\ngaps, so that there was a ladder from the lowest to the highest ranks,\r\nowing to the existence of many small holders of various degree, soon\r\nto be diminished by enclosure and consolidation.[374]\r\n\r\nThere was a great increase in the number of live stock owing to the\r\nspread, gradual though it was, of roots and clover, which increased\r\nthe winter food; 'of late years,' it was said in 1739, 'there have\r\nbeen improvements made in the breed of sheep by changing of rams, and\r\nsowing of turnips, grass seeds, &c.'[375] Crops, too, were improving;\r\nand enclosed lands about 1726 were said to produce over 20 bushels of\r\nwheat to the acre.[376]\r\n\r\nThough the number of Enclosure Acts at the beginning of the century\r\nwas nothing like the number at the end, the process was steadily going\r\non, often by non-parliamentary enclosure, and was approved by nearly\r\nevery one. Some, however, were opposed to it. John Cowper, who wrote\r\nan essay on 'Enclosing Commons' in 1732, said, a common was often the\r\nchief support of forty or fifty poor families, and even though their\r\nrights were bought out they were under the necessity of leaving their\r\nold homes, for their occupation was gone; but he says nothing of the\r\nwell-known increased demand for labour on the enclosed lands. The\r\nforce of his arguments may be gauged from his answer to Lawrence's\r\nstatement that enclosure is the greatest benefit to good husbandry,\r\nand a remedy for idleness. On the contrary, says he, who among the\r\ncountry people live lazier lives than the grazier and the dairyman?\r\nAll the dairyman has to do is to call his cows together to be milked!\r\n\r\nWorlidge in 1669 had lamented that turnips were so little grown by\r\nEnglish farmers in the field, and that it was a plant 'usually\r\nnourished in gardens',[377] and in a letter to Houghton in 1684, he is\r\nthe first to mention the feeding of turnips to sheep.[378] However, in\r\n1726 it was said that nothing of late years had turned to greater\r\nprofit to the farmer, who now found it one of his chief treasures; and\r\nthere were then three sorts: the round which was most common, the\r\nyellow, and the long.[379] For winter use they were to be sown from\r\nthe beginning of June to the middle of August, on fallow which had\r\nbeen brought to a good tilth, the seed harrowed in with a bush harrow,\r\nand if necessary rolled. When the plants had two or three leaves each\r\nthey were to be hoed out, leaving them five or six inches apart,\r\nthough some slovenly farmers did not trouble to do this; but there is\r\nno mention of hoeing between the rows. The fly was already recognized\r\nas a pest, and soot and common salt were used to fight it. Folding\r\nsheep in winter on turnips was then little practised, though Lawrence\r\nstrongly recommends it. According to Defoe,[380] Suffolk was\r\nremarkable for being the first county where the feeding and fattening\r\nof sheep and other cattle with turnips was first practised in England,\r\nto the great improvement of the land, 'whence', he says, 'the practice\r\nis spread over most of the east and south, to the great enriching of\r\nfarmers and increase of fat cattle.' There were great disputes as to\r\ncollecting the tithe, always a sore subject, on turnips; and the\r\ncustom seems to have been that if they were eaten off by store sheep\r\nthey went tithe free, if sheep were fattened on them the tithe was\r\npaid.[381]\r\n\r\nClover, the other great novelty of the seventeenth century, was now\r\ngenerally sown with barley, oats, or rye grass, about 15 lb. per acre.\r\nThis amount, sown on 2 acres of barley, would next year produce 2\r\nloads worth about £5. The next crop stood for seed, which was cut in\r\nAugust, the hay being worth £9, and the seed out of it, 300 lb., was\r\nsold much of it for 16d. a lb., the sum realized in that year from the\r\n2 acres being £30, without counting the aftermath. At this time most\r\nof the seed was still imported from Flanders.[382] Much of the common\r\nand waste land of England, not previously worth 6d. an acre, had been\r\nby 1732 vastly improved through sowing artificial grasses on it, so\r\nthat various people had gained considerable estates.[383]\r\n\r\nCarrots were also now grown as a field crop in places, especially near\r\nLondon, two sorts being known, the yellow and red, used chiefly by\r\nfarmers for feeding their hogs.[384] Of wheat the names were many, but\r\nthere were apparently only seven distinct sorts, the Double-eared,\r\nEggshell, Red or Kentish, Great-bearded, Pollard, Grey, and Flaxen or\r\nLammas.[385] The growth of saffron had declined, though the English\r\nvariety was the best in the world, according to Lawrence, and except\r\nin Cambridgeshire and about Saffron Walden it was little known.\r\n\r\nThough it was still some time before the days of Bakewell, increased\r\nattention was given to cattle-breeding; it was urged that a\r\nwell-shaped bull be put to cows, one that had 'a broad and curled\r\nforehead, long horns, fleshy neck, and a belly long and large.'[386]\r\nSuch in 1726 was the ideal type of the long-horns of the Midland and\r\nthe north, but it was noticed that of late years and especially in the\r\nnorth the Dutch breed was much sought after, which had short horns and\r\nlong necks, the breed with which the Collings were to work such\r\nwonders. The then great price of £20 had been given for a cow of this\r\nbreed. Bradley, Professor of Botany at Cambridge, and a well-known\r\nwriter on agriculture, divided the cattle of England into three sorts\r\naccording to their colour: the black, white, and red.[387] The black,\r\ncommonly the smallest, was the strongest for labour, chiefly found in\r\nmountainous countries; also bred chiefly in Cheshire, Yorkshire,\r\nLancashire, and Derbyshire, sixty years before this, and in those days\r\nCheshire cheese came from these cattle, apparently very much like the\r\nmodern Welsh breed.[388] The white were much larger, and very common\r\nin Lincolnshire at the end of the seventeenth century. They gave more\r\nmilk than the black sort but went dry sooner. They were also found in\r\nSuffolk and Surrey.\r\n\r\nThe red cattle were the largest in England, their milk rich and\r\nnourishing, so much so that it was given specially to consumptives.\r\nThey were first bred in Somerset, where in Bradley's time particular\r\nattention was paid to their breeding, and were evidently the ancestors\r\nof the modern Devons. About London these cows were often fed on\r\nturnips, given them tops and all, which made their milk bitter. They\r\nwere also found in Lincolnshire and some other counties, where 'they\r\nwere fed on the marshes', and Defoe saw, in the Weald of Kent, 'large\r\nKentish bullocks, generally all red with their horns crooked inward.'\r\nBradley gives the following balance sheet for a dairy of nine cows:[389]\r\n\r\n            DR.                                       £   s. d.\r\n\r\n  6 months' grass keep at 1s. 6d. per week per head   17 11  0\r\n  6 months' winter keep (straw, hay, turnips, and\r\n     grains) at 2s. per week per head                 23  8  0\r\n                                                     ---------\r\n                                                     £40 19  0\r\n                                                     =========\r\n            CR.\r\n  13,140 gallons of milk                             136 17  6\r\n                                                      40 19  0\r\n                                                     ---------\r\n                                    Balance (profit) £95 18  6\r\n                                                     =========\r\n\r\nA correspondent, however, pointed out to Bradley that this yield and\r\nprofit was far above the average, which was about £5 a cow, on whom\r\nBradley retorted that it could be made, though it was exceptional.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century the great trade of driving Scottish cattle\r\nto London began, Walter Scott's grandfather being the pioneer. The\r\nroute followed diverged from the Great North Road in Yorkshire in\r\norder to avoid turnpikes, and the cattle, grazing leisurely on the\r\nstrips of grass by the roadside, generally arrived at Smithfield in\r\ngood condition.[390]\r\n\r\nDefoe tells us that most of the Scottish cattle which came yearly\r\ninto England were brought to the village of S. Faiths, north of\r\nNorwich, 'where the Norfolk graziers go and buy them. These Scots\r\nrunts, coming out of the cold and barren highlands, feed so eagerly on\r\nthe rich pasture in these marshes that they grow very fat. There are\r\nabove 40,000 of these Scots cattle fed in this county every year. The\r\ngentlemen of Galloway go to England with their droves of cattle and\r\ntake the money themselves.'[391] It was no uncommon thing for a\r\nGalloway nobleman to send 4,000 black cattle and 4,000 sheep to\r\nEngland in a year, and altogether from 50,000 to 60,000 cattle were\r\nsaid to come to England from Galloway yearly. Gentlemen on the Border\r\nbefore the Union got a very pretty living by tolls from these cattle;\r\nand the Earl of Carlisle made a good income in this way.\r\n\r\nCattle were sometimes of a great size. In 1697, in the park of Sir\r\nJohn Fagg near Steyning, Defoe saw four bullocks of Sir John's own\r\nbreeding for which was refused in Defoe's hearing £26 apiece. They\r\nwere driven to Smithfield and realized £25 each, having probably sunk\r\non the way, but dressed they weighed 80 stone a quarter![392] These\r\nweights must have been very exceptional, but go to prove that cattle\r\nthen could be grown to much greater size than is generally credited. A\r\ngood price for a bullock in the first half of the eighteenth century\r\nwas from £7 to £10.\r\n\r\nThe best poultry at the same date (1736) were said to be 'the\r\nwhite-feathered sort', especially those that had short and white legs,\r\nwhich were esteemed for the whiteness of their flesh; but those that\r\nhad long yellow legs and yellow beaks were considered good for\r\nnothing.[393] Care was to be used in the choice of a cock, for those\r\nof the game kind were to be avoided as unprofitable. Bradley gives a\r\nbalance sheet for 12 hens and 2 cocks who had a free run in a farmyard\r\nand an orchard:[394]\r\n\r\n               DR.                         £   s.  d.\r\n\r\n  39 bushels of barley                     3   5   0\r\n  Balance, profit                             16   0\r\n                                          ----------\r\n                                          £4   1   0\r\n                                          ==========\r\n\r\n               CR.                         £   s.  d.\r\n\r\n  Eggs (number unfortunately not given)    1   5   0\r\n  20 early chickens at 1s.                 1   0   0\r\n  72 late chickens at 6d.                  1  16   0\r\n                                          ----------\r\n                                          £4   1   0\r\n                                          ==========\r\n\r\nHe also recommends that in stocking a farm of £200 a year the\r\nfollowing poultry should be purchased:\r\n\r\n                                    £  s. d.\r\n\r\n  24 chickens at 4d.                   8  0\r\n  20 geese                          1  0  0\r\n  20 turkeys                        1  0  0\r\n  24 ducks                            12  0\r\n  6 pair of pigeons                   12  0\r\n\r\nThe best way to fatten chickens, according to Bradley, was to put them\r\nin coops and feed them with barley meal, being careful to put a small\r\nquantity of brickdust in their water to give them an appetite.[395]\r\n\r\nOn this farm were 20 acres of cow pasture besides common, and this\r\nwith some turnips kept 9 cows, which gave about three gallons of milk\r\na day at least, the milk being worth 1d. a quart. His pigs were of the\r\n'Black Bantham' breed, which were better than the large sort common in\r\nEngland, for the flesh was much more delicate.\r\n\r\nSuffolk was famous for supplying London with turkeys.[396] Three\r\nhundred droves of turkeys, each numbering from 300 to 1000, had in one\r\nseason passed over Stratford Bridge on the road from Ipswich to\r\nLondon. Geese also travelled on foot to London in prodigious numbers\r\nfrom Norfolk, Suffolk, and the Fen country, often 1,000 to 3,000 in a\r\ndrove, starting in August when harvest was nearly over, so that the\r\ngeese might feed on the stubble by the way; 'and thus they hold on to\r\nthe end of October, when the roads begin to be too stiff and deep for\r\ntheir broad feet and short legs to march on.' There was, however, a\r\nmore rapid method of getting poultry to the great market, by means of\r\ncarts of four stages or stories, one above another, to carry the birds\r\nin, drawn by two horses, which by means of relays travelled night and\r\nday, and covered as much as 100 miles in two days and one night, the\r\ndriver sitting on the topmost stage.\r\n\r\nHop growing in 1729, according to Richard Bradley, paid well; he says,\r\n'ground never esteemed before worth a shilling an acre per annum, is\r\nrendered worth forty, fifty, or sometimes more pounds a year by\r\nplanting hops judiciously. An acre of hops shall bring to the owner\r\nclear profit about £30 yearly; but I have known hop grounds that have\r\ncleared above £50 yearly per acre.' At this date 12,000 acres in\r\nEngland were planted with hops.\r\n\r\nThe great market for hops was Stourbridge Fair, once the greatest mart\r\nin England and still preserving much of its former importance: 'there\r\nis scarce any price fixed for hops in England till they know how they\r\nsell in Stourbridge Fair.'[397] Thither they came from Chelmsford,\r\nCanterbury, Maidstone, and Farnham, where the bulk of the hops in\r\nEngland were then grown, though some were to be found at Wilton near\r\nSalisbury, in Herefordshire, and Worcestershire. Round Canterbury\r\nDefoe says there were 6,000 acres of hops, all planted within living\r\nmemory[398]; but the Maidstone district was called 'the mother of hop\r\ngrounds', and with the country round Feversham was famous for apples\r\nand cherries.\r\n\r\nThe finest wool still, it seems, came from near Leominster, where the\r\nsheep in Markham's time were described as small-boned and black-faced,\r\nwith a light fleece, and apparently they still had the same appearance\r\nat the beginning of the eighteenth century[399]; and large-boned\r\nsheep with coarser wool were to be found in the counties of Warwick,\r\nLeicester, Buckingham, Northampton, and Nottingham; in the north of\r\nEngland too were big-boned sheep with inferior wool, the largest with\r\ncoarse wool being found in the marshes of Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\nAbout this time wool had fallen much in price: 'Has nobody told you,'\r\nwrites a west country farmer to his absentee landlord in 1737, 'that\r\nwool has fallen to near half its price, and that we cannot find\r\npurchasers for a great part of it at any price whatsoever. When most\r\nof our estates (farms) were taken wool was generally 7d., 8d., or more\r\nby the pound; the same is now 4d. and still falling.'[400] But the\r\nlatter price was exceptionally low; Smith[401] gives the following\r\naverage prices per tod of 28 lb.:\r\n\r\n  1706             17s. 6d.\r\n  1717-8         23s. to 27s.\r\n  1737-42        11s. to 14s.\r\n  1743               20s.\r\n  1743-53            24s.\r\n\r\nAfter 1753 it fell again, largely owing to the great plague among\r\ncattle, which brought about a 'prodigious increase of sheep'[402];\r\nand about 1770 Young[403] favoured corn rather than wool, for there\r\nwas always a market for the former, but the foreign demand for cloth\r\nwas diminishing, especially in the case of France, besides prohibition\r\nof export kept down the price.[404] Yet although wool was being\r\ndeserted for corn it had in Young's time 'been so long supposed the\r\nstaple and foundation of all our wealth, that it is somewhat dangerous\r\nto hazard an opinion not consonant to its encouragement'.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the century, however, there was a rapid increase in the\r\nprice, partly due to increased demand by spinners and weavers who,\r\nowing to machinery, were working more economically; and partly to the\r\nenclosure of commons, and the ploughing up of land for corn.[405]\r\n\r\nCheshire had long been famous for cheese. Barnaby Googe, in the last\r\nquarter of the sixteenth century, says, 'in England the best cheese is\r\nthe Cheshyre and the Shropshyre, then the Banbury cheese, next the\r\nSuffolk and the Essex, and the very worst the Kentish cheese.' Camden,\r\nwho died in 1623, tells us that 'the grasse and fodder (in Cheshire)\r\nis of that goodness and vertue that cheeses be made here in great\r\nnumber, and of a most pleasing and delicate taste such as all England\r\nagain affordeth not the like, no though the best dairywomen otherwise\r\nand skillfullest in cheese making be had from hence;' and a little\r\nlater it was said no other county in the realm could compare with\r\nCheshire, not even that wonderful agricultural country Holland from\r\nwhich England learnt so much.[406] In Lawrence's time Cheddar cheese\r\nwas also famous, and there it had long been a custom for several\r\nneighbours to join their milk together to make cheeses, which were of\r\na large size, weighing from 30 lb. to 100 lb. Good cheese came also\r\nfrom Gloucestershire and Warwickshire. The Cheshire men sent great\r\nquantities by sea to London, a long and tedious voyage, or else by\r\nland to Burton-on-Trent, and down that river to Hull and then by sea\r\nto London. The Gloucestershire men took it to Lechlade and sent it\r\ndown the Thames; from Warwickshire it went by land all the way, or to\r\nOxford and thence down the Thames to London. Stilton, too, had lately\r\nbecome famous, and was considered the best of all, selling for the\r\nthen great price of 1s. a lb. on the farm, and 2s. 6d. at the Bell\r\nInn, Stilton, where it seems to have first been sold in large\r\nquantities, though Leicestershire perhaps claims the honour of first\r\nmaking it.[407]\r\n\r\nThe eastern side of Suffolk was, in Defoe's time, famous for the best\r\nbutter and perhaps the worst cheese in England, the butter being\r\n'barrelled and sometimes pickled up in small casks'.[408]\r\n\r\nRabbits were occasionally kept in large numbers for profit; at Auborne\r\nChase in Wilts, there was a warren of 700 acres surrounded by a\r\nwall--a most effective way of preventing escape, but somewhat\r\nexpensive. In winter time they were fed on hay, and hazel branches\r\nfrom which they ate the bark. They were never allowed to get below\r\n8,000 head, and from these, after deducting losses by poachers,\r\nweazles, polecats, foxes, &c., 24,000 were sold annually. These\r\nrabbits, owing to the quality of the grass, were famous for the\r\nsweetness of their flesh. The proprietor, Mr. Gilbert, began to kill\r\nthem at Bartholomewtide, Aug. 24, and from then to Michaelmas obtained\r\n9s. a dozen for them delivered free in London; but those from\r\nMichaelmas to Christmas realized 10s. 6d. a dozen.\r\n\r\nThe difference in price at the two periods is accounted for by the\r\nfact that their skins were much better in the latter, and the rabbits\r\nkept longer when killed; they must also have been larger. A skin\r\nbefore Michaelmas was only worth 1d., but soon after nearly 6d.; and\r\nin Hertfordshire was a warren where rabbit skins with silvery hair\r\nfetched 1s. each.[409]\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the period when the result of Jethro Tull's\r\nlabours was given to the world, his _Horse-hoeing Husbandry_ appearing\r\nin 1733. It is no exaggeration to say that agriculture owes more to\r\nTull than to any other man; the principles formulated in his famous\r\nbook revolutionized British agriculture, though we shall see that it\r\ntook a long time to do it. He has indeed been described as 'the\r\ngreatest individual improver agriculture ever knew'. He first realized\r\nthat deep and perfect pulverization is the great secret of vegetable\r\nnutrition, and was thus led on to perfect the system of drilling seed\r\nwide enough apart to admit of tillage in the intervals, and abandoning\r\nthe wide ridges in vogue, laid the land into narrow ridges 5 feet or 6\r\nfeet wide. He was born at Basildon in Berkshire, heir to a good\r\nestate, and was called to the bar in 1699, but on his marriage in the\r\nsame year settled on the paternal farm of Howberry in Oxfordshire. In\r\nhis preface to his book he throws a flash of light on country life at\r\na time when the roads were nearly as bad as in the Middle Ages, so\r\nthat they effectually isolated different parts of England, when he\r\nspeaks of 'a long confinement within the limits of a lonely farm, in a\r\ncountry where I am a stranger, having debarred me from all\r\nconversation'.[410]\r\n\r\nHe took to agriculture more by necessity than by choice, for he knew\r\ntoo much 'the inconveniency and slavery attending the exorbitant power\r\nof husbandry servants', and he further gives this extraordinary\r\ncharacter of the farm labourer of his day: ''Tis the most formidable\r\nobjection against our agriculture that the defection of labourers is\r\nsuch that few gentlemen can keep their land in their own hands, but\r\nlet them for a little to tenants who can bear to be insulted,\r\nassaulted, kicked, cuffed, and Bridewelled, with more patience than\r\ngentlemen are endowed with.'[411] Tull wrote just before it became the\r\nfashion for gentlemen to go into farming, and laments that the lands\r\nof the country were all, or mostly, in the hands of rack-renters,\r\nwhose supposed interest it was that they should never be improved for\r\nfear of fines and increased rents. Gentlemen then knew so little of\r\nfarming that they were unable to manage their estates. No doubt his\r\nscathing remarks helped to initiate the well-known change in this\r\nrespect, and soon, over all England, gentlemen of education and\r\nposition were engaged in removing this reproach from their class. The\r\nsame complaint as to their ignorance of matters connected with their\r\nland crops up again during the great French war, but they then had a\r\ngood excuse, as they were busy fighting the French.\r\n\r\nTull invented his drill about 1701 at Howberry. The first occasion for\r\nmaking it, he says, was that it 'was very difficult to find a man that\r\ncould sow clover tolerably; they had a habit to throw it once with the\r\nhand to two large strides and go twice in each cast; thus, with 9 or\r\n10 lb. of seed to an acre, two-thirds of the ground was unplanted. To\r\nremedy this I made a hopper, to be drawn by a boy, that planted an\r\nacre sufficiently with 6 lb. of seed; but when I added to this hopper\r\nan exceeding light plough that made 6 channels eight inches asunder,\r\ninto which 2 lb. to an acre being drilled the ground was as well\r\nplanted. This drill was easily drawn by a man, and sometimes by a\r\nboy.'\r\n\r\nHis invention was largely prompted by his desire to do without the\r\ninsolent farm servant whom he has described above, and the year after\r\nit was invented he certainly had his wish, for they struck in a body\r\nand were dismissed: 'it were more easy to teach the beasts of the\r\nfield than to drive the ploughman out of his way.'\r\n\r\nHis ideas were largely derived from the mechanism of the organ which,\r\nbeing fond of music, he had mastered in his youth--a rotary mechanism,\r\nwhich is the foundation of all agricultural sowing implements. His\r\nfirst invention may be described as a drill plough to sow wheat and\r\nturnip seed in drills three rows at a time, a harrow to cover the seed\r\nbeing attached. Afterwards he invented a turnip drill, so arranged as\r\nregards dropping the seed and its subsequent covering with soil that\r\nhalf the seed should come up earlier than the rest, to enable a\r\nportion at least to escape the dreaded fly. He was a great believer in\r\ndoing everything himself, and worked so hard at his drill that he had\r\nto go abroad for his health. He was somewhat carried away by his\r\ninvention, and asserts that the expense of a drilled crop of wheat was\r\none-ninth of that sown in the old way, giving the following figures to\r\nprove his assertion:\r\n\r\n  _The Old Way_\r\n                                                 £  s. d.\r\n\r\n  Seed, 2-1/2 bushels, at 3s.                       7  6\r\n  Three ploughings, harrrowing, and sowing         16  0\r\n  Weeding                                           2  0\r\n  Rent of preceding fallow                         10  0\r\n  Manure                                         2 10  0\r\n  Reaping                                           4  6\r\n                                               ---------\r\n                                               £ 4 10  0[412]\r\n                                               =========\r\n\r\n  _The New Way_\r\n\r\n\r\n  Seed, 3 pecks                                     2  3\r\n  Tillage                                           4  0\r\n  Drilling                                             6\r\n  Weeding                                              6\r\n  Uncovering (removing clods fallen on the wheat)      2\r\n  Brine and lime                                       1\r\n  Reaping                                           2  6\r\n                                                   -----\r\n                                                   10  0\r\n                                                   =====\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that he has omitted to charge rent for the year in\r\nwhich the crop was grown in both cases.\r\n\r\nHe considered fallowing and manure unnecessary, and grew without\r\nmanure 13 successive wheat crops on the same piece of ground, getting\r\nbetter crops than his neighbours who pursued the ordinary course of\r\nfarming. His three great principles, indeed, were drilling, reduction\r\nof seed, and absence of weeds, and he saw that dung was a great\r\ncarrier of the latter but lacked a due appreciation of its chemical\r\naction. Of course, like all _improvers_, he was met with unlimited\r\nopposition, and on the publication of his book he was assailed with\r\nabuse, which, being a sensitive man, caused him extreme annoyance. His\r\nhealth was bad, his troubles with his labourers unending, his son a\r\nspendthrift, and he died at his now famous home, Prosperous Farm, near\r\nHungerford, in 1741, having said not long before his death, 'Some,\r\nallowed as good judges, have upon a full view and examination of my\r\npractice declared their opinion that it would one day become the\r\ngeneral husbandry of England.'[413] Scotland was the first to perceive\r\nthe merits of the system, and it gradually worked southwards into\r\nEngland, but for many years had to fight against ignorance and\r\nprejudice, even so intelligent a man as Arthur Young being opposed to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFarm leases had by this time assumed their modern form, and\r\ncultivation clauses were numerous. In one of 1732, at Hawsted, the\r\ntenant was to keep the hedges in repair, being allowed bushes and\r\nstakes for so doing. He was also to bestow on some part of the lands\r\none load of good rotten muck over and above what was made on the farm\r\nfor every load of hay, straw, or stover (fodder) which he should carry\r\noff.[414] In another of 1740, he was to leave in the last year of the\r\ntenancy one-third of the arable land summer tilled, ploughed, and\r\nfallowed, for which he was to be paid according to the custom of the\r\ncountry. In 1753, in the lease of Pinford End Farm, there was a\r\npenalty of £10 an acre for breaking up pasture; a great increase in\r\nthe amount of the penalty. All compost, dung, soil, and ashes arising\r\non the farm were to be bestowed upon it.\r\n\r\nOnly two crops successively were to be taken on any of the arable\r\nland, but land sown with clover and rye-grass, if fed off, or with\r\nturnips which were fed on some part of the farm, were not to count as\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nThe ashes mentioned were those from wood, which were now carefully\r\nlooked after, as it had become the custom to sell them to the\r\nsoap-boilers, who came round to every farm collecting them. This is\r\nthe earliest mention in a Hawsted lease of rye-grass, clover, and\r\nturnips, though clover and turnips had been first cultivated there\r\nabout 1700, and soon spread.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1708-9 was very severe, a great frost lasting from\r\nOctober until the spring; wheat was 81s. 9d. a quarter, and high\r\nprices lasted until 1715.[415]\r\n\r\nFrom 1715 to 1765 was an era of good seasons and low prices generally;\r\nin that half-century Tooke says there were only five bad seasons. In\r\n1732 prices of corn were very low, wheat being about 24s. a quarter,\r\nso that we are not surprised to find that its cultivation often did\r\nnot pay at all.[416]\r\n\r\nAt Little Gadsden in Hertfordshire, in that year a fair season, and on\r\nenclosed land, the following is the balance sheet for an acre:\r\n\r\n                             DR.                      £  s. d.\r\n\r\n  Rent                                                  12  0\r\n  Dressing (manuring)                                 1  0  0\r\n  2-1/2 bushels of seed                                  7  6\r\n  Ploughing first time                                   6  0\r\n      \"     twice more                                   8  0\r\n  Harrowing                                                 6\r\n  Reaping and carrying                                   6  6\r\n  Threshing                                              3  9\r\n                                                     --------\r\n                                                      3  4  3\r\n                                                     ========\r\n\r\n                             CR.            £   s. d.\r\n\r\n  15 bushels of wheat (a poor crop, as\r\n    20 bushels was now about the average)    2  2  0\r\n  Straw                                        11  6\r\n\r\n                                                      2 13  6\r\n                                                     --------\r\n                             _LOSS_                     10  9\r\n                                                     ========\r\n\r\nOn barley, worth about £1 a quarter, the loss was 3s. 6d. an acre; on\r\noats, worth 13s. a quarter, however, the profit was 21s.; on beans,\r\n26s. 6d., these being that year exceptionally good and worth 20s. a\r\nquarter.[417] Ellis objected to the new mode of drilling wheat\r\nbecause, he said, the rows are more exposed to the violence of the\r\nwinds, rains, &c., by growing apart, than if close together, when the\r\nstalks support each other.[418] This estimate may be compared to that\r\nof Tull for the 'old way' of sowing wheat,[419] and to the following\r\nestimate of fifty years later in Surrey, when wheat was a much better\r\nprice:--\r\n\r\n                            DR.                    £  s. d.\r\n\r\n  Rent, tithe, taxes                               1  0  0\r\n  Team, &c.                                        1  0  0\r\n  2 bushels of seed                                  10  0\r\n  Carting and spreading manure and water furrowing    2  6\r\n  Brining                                                6\r\n  Weeding                                             1  6\r\n  Reaping and carrying                                9  0\r\n  Threshing and cleaning                              7  6\r\n  Binding straw                                       1  6\r\n                                                 ---------\r\n                                                  £3 12  6[420]\r\n                                                 =========\r\n\r\n                            CR.\r\n  20 bushels at 5s.                                5  0  0\r\n  1-1/2 loads of straw                             1  2  6\r\n                                                 ---------\r\n                                                  £6  2  6\r\n                                                 =========\r\n\r\nThe profit was thus £2 10s. 0d. an acre, and for barley it was £3 3s.\r\n6d., for oats £1 19s. 10d., for beans £1 13s. 0d.[421]\r\n\r\nThis crop of wheat was not very good, as the average in that district\r\nwas from 20 to 25 bushels per acre, and Young before this saw crops of\r\n30 bushels per acre growing. The over frequent use of fallows, which\r\nhad so long marked agriculture, was in the early half of the\r\neighteenth century beginning to be strongly disapproved of. Bradley\r\nadvocated the continuous cultivation of the ground with different\r\nkinds of crops, 'for I find', he said, 'by experience that if such\r\ncrops are sown as are full of fibrous roots, such roots greatly help\r\nto open the parts of grounds inclining to too much stiffness.'[422]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[367] _Six Centuries of Work and Wages_, p. 472.\r\n\r\n[368] See Baker, _Record of Seasons and Prices_, p. 185.\r\n\r\n[369] Eden, _State of the Poor_, iii p. cvii; Thorold Rogers, _Work\r\nand Wages_, p. 396.\r\n\r\n[370] In Herefordshire at this time it was 1-1/2d. per lb.\r\n\r\n[371] Hasbach, _op. cit._ p. 86.\r\n\r\n[372] Eden, _op. cit._ i. 286.\r\n\r\n[373] Ibid. i. 498.\r\n\r\n[374] Hasbach, _op. cit._ p. 71.\r\n\r\n[375] Smith, _Memoirs of Wool_, ii. 93.\r\n\r\n[376] John Lawrence, _New System of Agriculture_, p. 45.

FRUIT-GROWING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1730 Charles, second Viscount Townshend, retired from politics, on\r\nhis quarrel with his brother-in-law Walpole, who remarked that 'as\r\nlong as the firm was Townshend and Walpole the utmost harmony\r\nprevailed, but it no sooner became Walpole and Townshend than things\r\nwent wrong'. He devoted himself to the management of his Norfolk\r\nestates and set an example to English landlords in wisely and\r\ndiligently experimenting in farm practice which was soon followed on\r\nall sides, the names of Lords Ducie, Peterborough, and Bolingbroke\r\nbeing the best known of his fellow-labourers. A generation afterwards\r\nYoung wrote, 'half the County of Norfolk within the memory of man\r\nyielded nothing but sheep feed, whereas those very tracts of land are\r\nnow covered with as fine barley and rye as any in the world and great\r\nquantities of wheat besides.'[423] There can be no doubt from this\r\nstatement, made by an eyewitness of exceptional capacity, that he\r\ncommenced the work so nobly carried on by Coke. The same authority\r\ntells us that when Townshend began his improvements near Norwich much\r\nof the land was an extensive heath without either tree or shrub, only\r\na sheepwalk to another farm; so many carriages crossed it that they\r\nwould sometimes be a mile abreast of each other in pursuit of the best\r\ntrack. By 1760 there was an excellent turnpike road, enclosed on each\r\nside with a good quickset hedge, and all the land let out in\r\nenclosures and cultivated on the Norfolk system in superior style; the\r\nwhole being let at 15s. an acre, or ten times its original value.\r\nTownshend's two special hobbies were the field cultivation of turnips,\r\nand improvement in the rotation of crops. Pope says his conversation\r\nwas largely of turnips, and he was so zealous in advocating them that\r\nhe was nicknamed 'Turnip Townsend'.[424] He initiated the Norfolk or\r\nfour-course system of cropping, in which roots, grasses, and cereals\r\nwere wisely blended, viz. turnips, barley, clover and rye grass,\r\nwheat. He also reintroduced marling to the light lands of Norfolk, and\r\nfollowed Tull's system of drilling and horse-hoeing turnips, with the\r\nresult that the poor land of which his estate was largely composed was\r\nconverted into good corn and cattle-growing farms. Like all the\r\nprogressive agriculturists of the day, he was an advocate of\r\nenclosures, and he had no small share in the growth of the movement by\r\nwhich, in the reigns of Anne and the first two Georges, 244 enclosure\r\nActs were passed and 338,177 acres enclosed. The progress of enclosure\r\nwas alleged as a proof that England was never more prosperous than\r\nunder Walpole; the number of private gentlemen in Britain of ample\r\nestates was said to exceed that of any country in the world\r\nproportionately, and was far greater than in the reign of Charles II.\r\nThe value of land at twenty-six or twenty-seven years' purchase was a\r\nconclusive proof of the wealth of England.[425]\r\n\r\nThough, however, the first half of the century was generally\r\nprosperous there were bad times for farmer and landlord. We have seen\r\nthat wheat-growing paid little, although from 1689 to 1773 the farmer\r\nwas protected against imports and aided by a bounty on exports. In\r\n1738 Lord Lyttelton wrote: 'In most parts of England, gentlemen's\r\nrents are so ill paid and the weight of taxes lies so heavy upon them\r\nthat those who have nothing from the Court can scarce support their\r\nfamilies.'[426] Sheep in the damp climate of England have always been\r\nsubject to rot, and in 1735 there was, according to Ellis, the most\r\ngeneral rot in the memory of man owing to a very wet season; and, as\r\nin the disastrous year of 1879, which must be fresh in many farmers'\r\nmemories, other animals, deer, hares, and rabbits, were affected also;\r\nand the dead bodies of rotten sheep were so numerous in road and field\r\nthat the stench was offensive to every one. Another bad outbreak\r\noccurred in 1747. It is well known that farmers are always grumblers,\r\nprobably with an eye to the rent; but even in these much praised times\r\nthey apparently made small profits. The west country farmer quoted\r\nbefore, who had been fifty years on the same estate, and writes with\r\nthe stamp of sincerity, admits in 1737 that 'with all the skill and\r\ndiligence in the world he can hardly keep the cart upon the wheels.\r\nWool had gone down, wheat didn't pay and graziers were doing badly;\r\ntho' formerly our cattle and wool was always a sure card'. He says\r\nthat the profits of grazing were reckoned at one-third of the\r\nimprovement that ensued from the grazing, but the grazier was not now\r\ngetting this. He attributed much of the distress, however, to the\r\nextravagance of the times. Landlords, including his own, preferred\r\nLondon to the country, and spent their money there. How different was\r\nthe behaviour of his landlord's grandfather. 'Many a time would his\r\nworship send for me to go a-hunting or shooting with him; often would\r\nhe take me with him on his visits and would introduce me as his\r\nfriend. The country gentlewoman and the parson's wife, that used to\r\nstitch for themselves, are now so hurried with dressings and visits\r\nand other attractions that they hire an Abigail to do it.'\r\n\r\nHe thought, too, the labourers were getting too high wages; 'they are\r\nso puffed up by our provender as to offer us their heels and threaten\r\non any occasion to leave us to do our work ourselves.' One would like\r\nto hear the labourers' opinion on this point, but they were dumb. In\r\nspite of higher wages the young men and young women flocked to the\r\ncities, and those who remain were lazy and extravagant, even the\r\ncountry wenches contending about 'double caps, huge petticoats, clock\r\nstockings, and other trumpery'.[427]\r\n\r\nThe bounty now paid on the export of wheat was naturally resented by\r\nthe common people, as it raised the price of their bread. In 1737 a\r\nload belonging to Farmer Waters of Burford, travelling along the road\r\nto Redbridge for exportation, was stopped near White parish by a crowd\r\nof people who knocked down the leading horse, broke the wagon in\r\npieces, cut the sacks, and strewed about the corn, with threats that\r\nthey would do the like to all who sold wheat to export.[428] While\r\nEngland was paying farmers to export wheat she was also importing,\r\nthough in plentiful years importers had a very bad time. In 1730 there\r\nwere lying at Liverpool 33,000 windles (a windle--220 lb.) of imported\r\ncorn, unsaleable owing to the great crop in England.[429] The year\r\n1740 was distinguished by one of the severest winters on record. From\r\nJanuary 1 to February 5 the thermometer seldom reached 32°, and the\r\ncold was so intense that hens and ducks, even cattle in their stalls\r\ndied of it, trees were split asunder, crows and other birds fell to\r\nthe ground frozen in their flight. This extraordinary winter was\r\nfollowed by a cold and late spring; no verdure had appeared by May; in\r\nJuly it was still cold, and thousands of acres of turnips rotted in\r\nthe ground. Among minor misfortunes may be noticed the swarms of\r\ngrasshoppers who devastated the pastures near Bristol at the end of\r\nAugust 1742,[430] and the swarms of locusts who came to England in\r\n1748 and consumed the vegetables.[431]\r\n\r\nThe cattle plague of 1745[432] was so severe that owing to the\r\nscarcity of stock great quantities of grass land were ploughed up,\r\nwhich helped to account for the fact that in 1750 the export of corn\r\nfrom England reached its maximum; though the main cause of this was\r\nthe long series of excellent seasons that set in after 1740.[433] The\r\ncattle plague also raged in 1754 in spite of an Order in Council that\r\nall infected cattle should be shot and buried 4 ft. deep, and pitch,\r\ntar, rosin, and gunpowder burnt where infected cattle had died, and\r\ncow-houses washed with vinegar and water. Such were the sanitary\r\nprecautions of the time.[434] In 1756 came another bad year, corn was\r\nso scarce that there were many riots; the king expressed to Parliament\r\nhis concern at the suffering of the poor, and the export of corn was\r\ntemporarily prohibited. The fluctuations in price are remarkable: in\r\n1756, before the deficiency of the harvest was realized, wheat was\r\n22s. and it went up at the following rate: Jan., 1757, 49s.; Feb.,\r\n51s.; March, 54s.; April, 64s.; June, 72s.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the century, if we may judge from the _Compleat\r\nCyderman_ written in 1754 by experienced hands living in Devon,\r\nCornwall, Herefordshire, and elsewhere, fruit-growing received an\r\namount of attention which diminished greatly in after years. The\r\nauthors fully realized that an orchard under tillage causes apple\r\ntrees to grow as fast again as under grass, and this was well\r\nunderstood and practised in Kent, where crops of corn were grown\r\nbetween the trees.\r\n\r\nA Devonshire 'cyderist' urged that orchards should be well sheltered\r\nfrom the east winds, which 'bring over the narrow sea swarms of\r\nimperceptible eggs, or insects in the air, from the vast tracts of\r\nTartarian and other lands, from which proceeded infinite numbers of\r\nlice, flies, bugs, caterpillars, cobwebs, &c.' The best protection\r\nwas a screen of trees, and the best tree for the purpose, a perry pear\r\ntree. In the hard frosts of 1709, 1716, and 1740 great numbers of\r\nfruit and other trees had been destroyed. In Devon what was called the\r\n'Southams method' was used for top-dressing the roots of old apple\r\ntrees, which was done in November with soil from the roads and\r\nditches, or lime or chalk, laid on furze sometimes, 6 inches thick,\r\nfor 4 or 5 ft. all round the trees. Great attention was paid there to\r\nkeeping the heads of fruit trees in good order, so that branches did\r\nnot interfere with each other,[435] and the heads were made to spread\r\nas much as possible. Many of the trees were grown with the first\r\nbranches commencing 4 ft. 6 in. from the ground. It was claimed that\r\nDevon excelled all other parts of England in the management of fruit\r\ntrees, a reputation that was not maintained, according to the works of\r\nhalf a century later. The best cider apple In the county then was the\r\nWhite-sour, white in colour, of a middling size, and early ripe; other\r\ngood ones were the 'Deux-Anns, Jersey, French Longtail, Royal Wilding,\r\nCulvering, Russet, Holland Pippin, and Cowley Crab.' In Herefordshire\r\nit was the custom to open the earth about the roots of the apple trees\r\nand lay them bare and exposed for the 'twelve days of the Christmas\r\nholidays', that the wind might loosen them. Then they were covered\r\nwith a compost of dung, mould, and a little lime. 'The best way' to\r\nplant was to take off the turf and lay it by itself, then the next\r\nearth or virgin mould, to be laid also by itself. Next put horse\r\nlitter over the bottom of the hole with some of the virgin mould on\r\nthat, on which place the tree, scattering some more virgin mould over\r\nthe roots, then spread some old horse-dung over this and upon that the\r\nturf, leaving it in a basin shape. The ground between the trees in\r\nDevonshire in young orchards was first planted with cabbage plants,\r\nnext year with potatoes, next with beans, and so on until the heads of\r\nthe trees became large enough, when the land was allowed to return to\r\npasture, a proceeding which was quite contrary to their previously\r\nquoted assertion that tillage was best for fruit trees. The\r\ncider-makers were quite convinced, as many are to-day, that rotten\r\napples were invaluable for cider, and the lady who was famous for the\r\nbest cider in the county never allowed one to be thrown away. A\r\ngeneration later than this Marshall[436] noted that in Herefordshire\r\nthe management of orchards and their produce was far from being well\r\nunderstood, though 'it has ever borne the name of the first cider\r\ncounty'. All the old fruits were lost or declining in quality, the\r\nfamous Red Streak Apple was given up and the Squash Pear no longer\r\nmade to flourish.\r\n\r\nAs for prices, in 1707 apples were selling at Liverpool for 2s. 6d. a\r\nbushel,[437] a very good price if we allow for the difference in the\r\nvalue of money, but prices then were entirely dependent on the English\r\nseasons; no foreign apples were imported, and a night's frost would\r\ntreble prices in a day. In 1742 at Aspall Hall, Suffolk, apples,\r\napparently for cider, were 10d. a bushel, in 1745 1s. a bushel, in\r\n1746 only 4d., and in 1747 cider there was worth 6d. a gallon.[438] At\r\nthe end of the century, in 'the great hit' of 1784, common apples were\r\nless than 6d. a bushel, the best about 2s. in 1786 the price was twice\r\nas high, owing to a short crop. Incidentally there is mentioned in the\r\n_Compleat Cyderman_ a novel implement, 'a most profitable new invented\r\nfive-hoe plough, that after the ground has been once ploughed with a\r\ncommon plough will plough four or five acres in one day with only four\r\nhorses, and by a little alteration is fitted to hoe turnips or rape\r\ncrops as it is now practised by the ordinary farmers'; much too\r\nfavourable an estimate of the ordinary farmer, as Young found\r\nhorse-hoeing rare.\r\n\r\nAn acre of good orchard land at this time was let at £2 an acre; and\r\nthis is a fair balance sheet for an acre[439]:--\r\n\r\n                     DR.                              £   s. d.\r\n\r\n  Rent of one acre                                    2   0  0\r\n  Tithe on 10 hogsheads, @ 6d.                            5  0\r\n  Gathering, making, and carriage to and\r\n       from the pound, @ 3s. 6d. a hogshead           1  15  0\r\n  Racking twice, @ 6d.                                    5  0\r\n  Casks and cooperage                                     8  0\r\n                                                     ---------\r\n                                                     £4  13  0\r\n                                                     =========\r\n\r\n                     CR.                              £   s. d.\r\n\r\n  10 hogsheads diminished by racking\r\n     and waste to 8, @ 12s. 6d.                       5   0  0\r\n                                                      ========\r\n\r\nLeaving a balance of 7s. for spoiling, &c., so there was not much\r\nprofit in cider-making then.

When he was twenty-six he took a farm of 300 acres at Samford\r\nHall in Essex, and after five years of it paid a farmer £100 to take\r\nit off his hands, who thereupon made a fortune out of it. He had\r\nalready begun writing on agriculture, and it must be confessed that he\r\nbegan to advise people concerning the art of agriculture on a very\r\nlimited experience. It paid him, however, much better than farming,\r\nfor between 1766 and 1775 he realized £3,000 on his works, among which\r\nwere _The Farmer's Letters_, _The Southern_, _Northern_, and _Eastern\r\nTours_. These are his qualifications for writing on agriculture, from\r\nhis own pen: 'I have been a farmer these many years' (he was not yet\r\nthirty), 'and that not in a single field or two but upon a tract of\r\nnear 300 acres most part of the time. I have cultivated on various\r\nsoils most of the vegetables common in England and many never\r\nintroduced into field husbandry. I have always kept a minute register\r\nof my business in every detail of culture, expenses, and produce, and\r\nan accurate comparison of the old and new husbandry.'[440] It is said\r\nthat though he really understood the theory and practice of farming he\r\nfailed utterly in small economies. He was also far too vivacious and\r\nfond of society for the monotonous work of the plain farmer. At the\r\nsame time his failures gave his observant mind a clear insight into\r\nthe principles of agriculture. He was indefatigable in inquiries,\r\nresearches, and experiments; and the best proof of the value of his\r\nworks is that they were translated into Russian, German, and French.\r\nHe tells us in the preface to _Rural Economy_ that his constant\r\nemployment for the previous seven years, 'when out of my fields, has\r\nbeen registering experiments.' His pet aversions were absentee\r\nlandlords, obsolete methods of cultivation, wastes and commons, and\r\nsmall holdings (though towards the end of his life he changed his\r\nopinion as to the last); and the following, according to him, were the\r\nespecially needed improvements of the time:--\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of good rotations of crops so as to do away with\r\nfallows, which was to be effected by the general use of turnips,\r\nbeans, peas, tares, clover, &c., as preparation for white corn;\r\ncovered drains; marling, chalking, and claying; irrigation of meadows;\r\ncultivation of carrots, cabbages, potatoes, sainfoin, and lucerne;\r\nploughing, &c., with as few cattle as possible; the use of harness for\r\noxen; cultivation of madden liquorice, hemp, and flax where\r\nsuitable.[441] Above all, the cultivation of waste lands, which he was\r\nto live to see so largely effected.\r\n\r\nThere was little knowledge of the various sorts of grasses at this\r\ntime, and to Young is due the credit of introducing the cocksfoot, and\r\ncrested dog's tail.\r\n\r\nIn 1790 he contemplated retiring to France or America, so heavy was\r\ntaxation in England. 'Men of large fortune and the poor', he said, in\r\nwords which many to-day will heartily endorse, 'have reason to think\r\nthe government of this country the first in the world; the middle\r\nclasses bear the brunt.' Perhaps to-day 'men of large fortune' have\r\naltered their opinion and only 'the poor' are satisfied. However, he\r\nonly visited France, and gave us his vivid picture of that country\r\nbefore the great revolution.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 the Board of Agriculture was formed, and Young was made\r\nsecretary with a salary of £400 a year.\r\n\r\nAbout 1810 he wrote that the preceding half-century had been by far\r\nthe most interesting in the progress of agriculture, and ascribes the\r\nincrease of interest in it to the publication of his _Tours_. George\r\nIII told him he always took with him the _Farmer's Letters_. The\r\nimprovement, Young said, had been largely due to individual effort,\r\nfor commerce had been predominant in Parliament and agriculture had\r\nbegun to be neglected; a statement which, seeing that Parliament was\r\nthen almost entirely composed of landowners, must be accepted with\r\nsome reserve.\r\n\r\nYoung died in 1820, having been totally blind for some time, a\r\nmisfortune which did not prevent him working hard. In his well-known\r\n_Tours_ he often had much difficulty in obtaining information, and\r\nconfesses that he was forced to make more than one farmer drunk before\r\nhe got anything out of him.\r\n\r\nThe exodus from the country to the towns then, as so often in history,\r\nwas noted by thinking people, but Young says it was merely a natural\r\nconsequence of the demand for profitable employment and was not to be\r\nregretted; but he wrote in a time when the country population was\r\nstill numerous, and there was little danger of England becoming, what\r\nshe is to-day, a country without a solid foundation, with no reservoir\r\nof good country blood to supply the waste of the towns.\r\n\r\nWhen Young began to write, the example of Townshend and his\r\ncontemporaries was being followed on all sides, and this good movement\r\nwas stimulated by Young's writings. Farming was the reigning taste of\r\nthe day. There was scarce a nobleman without his farm, most of the\r\ncountry gentlemen were farmers, and attended closely to their business\r\ninstead of leaving it to stewards, 'who governed in matters of wheat\r\nand barley as absolutely as in covenants of leases,' and the squire\r\ndelighted in setting the country a staring at the novelties he\r\nintroduced. Even the stable and the kennel were ousted by farming from\r\nrural talk,[442] and citizens who breathed the smoke of London five\r\ndays a week were farmers the other two, and many young fellows of\r\nsmall fortune who had been brought up in the country took farms, and\r\nthe fashion was followed by doctors, lawyers, clergymen, soldiers,\r\nsailors, and merchants. The American and French War of 1775-83 and the\r\ngreat conflict with France from 1793 to 1815 were, however, to divert\r\nmany of the upper classes from agriculture, for they very properly\r\nthought their duty was then to fight for their country; so that we\r\nagain have numerous complaints of agents and stewards managing estates\r\nwho knew nothing whatever about their business. It was not to be\r\nwondered at that all this activity brought about considerable\r\nprogress. 'There have been,' said Young about 1770, 'more experiments,\r\nmore discoveries, and more general good sense displayed within these\r\nten years than in a hundred preceding ones,' a statement which perhaps\r\ndid not attach sufficient importance to the work of Townshend and his\r\ncontemporaries, and to the 'new husbandry' of Tull, which Young did\r\nnot appreciate at its full value.[443]\r\n\r\nThe place subsequently taken by the Board of Agriculture, and in our\r\ntime by the Royal Agricultural Society, was then occupied by the\r\nSociety for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce,\r\nwhich offered premiums for such objects as the cultivation of carrots\r\nin the field for stock, then little practised; for gathering the\r\ndifferent sorts of grass seeds and keeping them clean and free from\r\nall mixture with other grasses, a very rare thing at that time; for\r\nexperiments in the comparative merits of the old and new husbandry;\r\nfor the growth of madder; £20 for a turnip-slicing machine, then\r\napparently unknown, and for experiments whether rolling or harrowing\r\ngrass land was better, 'at present one of the most disputed points of\r\nhusbandry.'\r\n\r\nIn spite of this progress, many crops introduced years before were\r\nunknown to many farmers. Sainfoin, cabbages, potatoes, carrots, were\r\nnot common crops in every part of England, though every one of them\r\nwas well known in some part or other; not more than half, or at most\r\ntwo-thirds, of the nation cultivated clover. Many, however, of the\r\nnobility and gentry in the north had grown cabbages with amazing\r\nsuccess, lately, 30 guineas an acre being sometimes the value of the\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nHalf the cultivated lands, in spite of the progress of enclosure for\r\ncenturies, were still farmed on the old common-field system. When\r\nanything out of the common was to be done on common farms, all common\r\nwork came to a standstill. 'To carry out corn stops the ploughs,\r\nperhaps at a critical season; the fallows are frequently seen overrun\r\nwith weeds because it is seed time; in a word, some business is ever\r\nneglected.'[444] As for the outcry against enclosing commons and\r\nwastes, people forgot that the farmers as well as the poor had a right\r\nof common and took special care by their large number of stock to\r\nstarve every animal the poor put on the common.[445]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time that Young wrote these words there appeared a\r\npamphlet written by 'A Country Gentleman' on the advantages and\r\ndisadvantages of enclosing waste lands and common fields, which puts\r\nthe arguments against enclosure very forcibly.[446] The writer's\r\nopinion was that it was clearly to the landowner's gain to promote\r\nenclosures, but that the impropriator of tithes reaped most benefit\r\nand the small freeholder least, because his expenses increased\r\ninversely to the smallness of his allotment. As to diminution of\r\nemployment, he reckoned that enclosed arable employed about ten\r\nfamilies per 1,000 acres, open field arable twenty families, a\r\nstatement opposed to the opinion of nearly all the agricultural\r\nwriters of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It is surely an\r\nincontestable fact that enclosed land meant much better tillage, and\r\nbetter tillage meant more labour, the excessive amount of fallow\r\nnecessary under the common-field system, from the inability to grow\r\nroots except by special arrangement, is alone enough to prove this.\r\nThe same writer admitted that common pastures, wastes, &c., employed\r\nonly one family per 2,000 acres, but enclosed pasture five families\r\nper 1,000 acres, and enclosed wastes sixteen families.\r\n\r\nA 'Country Farmer', who wrote in 1786, states that many of the small\r\nfarmers displaced by enclosures sold their few possessions and\r\nemigrated to America.[447] The growing manufacturing towns also\r\nabsorbed a considerable number. That there was a considerable amount\r\nof hardship inflicted on small holders and commoners is certain, but\r\nindustrial progress is frequently attended by the dislocation of\r\nindustry and consequent distress; the introduction of machinery, for\r\ninstance, often causing great suffering to hand-workers, but\r\neventually benefiting the whole community. How many men has the\r\nself-binding reaping machine thrown for a time out of work? So\r\nenclosure caused distress to many individuals, but was for the good of\r\nthe whole nation. The history of enclosure is really the history of\r\nprogress in farming; the conversion of land badly tilled in the old\r\ncommon fields, and of waste land little more valuable than the\r\nprairies; into well-managed fruitful farms. That much of the\r\ncommon-field land when enclosed was laid down to grass is certainly\r\ntrue, and certainly inevitable if it paid best under grass.[448] No\r\none can expect the holders of land naturally best suited for grass to\r\nkeep it under tillage for philanthropic purposes. A vast number of the\r\ncommoners too were idle thriftless beings, whose rights on a few acres\r\nenabled them to live a life of pilfering and poaching; and it was a\r\nvery good thing when such people were induced to lead a more regular\r\nand respectable existence. The great blot on the process was that it\r\nmade the English labourer a landless man. Compensation was given him\r\nat the time of enclosure in the shape of allotments or sums of money,\r\nbut the former he was generally compelled to give up owing to the\r\nexpense he had been put to at allotment, and the latter he often spent\r\nin the public-house.\r\n\r\nAt this date the proprietors of large estates who wished to enclose by\r\nAct of Parliament, generally settled all the particulars among\r\nthemselves before calling any meeting of the rest of the proprietors.\r\nThe small proprietor had very little say either in regulating the\r\nclauses of the Act, or in the choice of commissioners. Any owner of\r\none-fifth of the land, however, could negative the measure and often\r\nused his right to impose unreasonable clauses. It is well known that\r\nthe legal expenses and fencing were very costly. The enclosure\r\ncommissioners too often divided the land in an arbitrary and ignorant\r\nmanner, and there was no appeal from them except by filing a bill in\r\nChancery. Accounts were hardly ever shown by the commissioners, and if\r\na proprietor refused to pay the sums levied they were empowered to\r\ndistrain immediately. All these evils attending enclosure made many\r\nwho were eager to benefit by it very chary in commencing it.[449]\r\n\r\nThen, as now, one of the commonest errors of farmers was that of\r\ntaking too much land for their capital; Young considered £6 an acre\r\nnecessary on an average, equal to more than £12 to-day; a sum which\r\nfew farmers at any time have in hand when they take a farm. As for\r\ngentlemen farmers, who were then rushing into the business, they were\r\nwarned that they had no chance of success if they kept any company or\r\namused themselves with anything but their own business, unless perhaps\r\nthey had a good bailiff.\r\n\r\nLime, one of the most ancient of manures, was then the most commonly\r\nused in England, 80 to 100 loads an acre being a common dressing, but\r\nmany farmers were very ignorant of its proper use. Marl, which to-day\r\nis seldom used, was considered to last for twenty years, though for\r\nthe first year no benefit was observable, and very little the second\r\nand the third, its value then becoming very apparent. In the last five\r\nyears, however, its value was nearly worn out. But it was much to be\r\nquestioned whether marl in its best state anywhere yields an increase\r\nof produce equal to that which a good manuring of dung will give.[450]\r\nMarl was applied in huge quantities on arable and grass, and often\r\nmade the latter look like arable land so thickly was it spread.\r\n\r\nAt this date (1770) the average crops on poor, and on good land were[451]:\r\n\r\n  On land worth 5s. an acre:\r\n\r\n    Wheat                         12 bushels per acre.\r\n    Rye                           16    \"       \"\r\n    Barley                        16    \"       \"\r\n    Oats                          20    \"       \"\r\n    Turnips, to the value of £1.\r\n    Clover         \"         \"\r\n\r\n  On land worth 20s. an acre:\r\n\r\n    Wheat                         28 bushels per acre.\r\n    Barley                        40     \"      \"\r\n    Oats                          48     \"      \"\r\n    Beans                         40     \"      \"\r\n    Turnips, to the value of £3.\r\n    Clover         \"       \"\r\n\r\nThe cost of cultivating the latter, which may be given in full, as it\r\naffords an excellent example of the price of growing various crops,\r\nand the methods of their cultivation at this period, was as follows:\r\n\r\n  First year, turnips:              £   s.  d.\r\n\r\n    Rent                            1   0   0\r\n    Tithe and 'town charges'            8   0\r\n    Five ploughings, @ 4s.          1   0   0\r\n    Three harrowings                    1   0\r\n    Seed                                    6\r\n    Sowing                                  3\r\n    Twice hand-hoeing                   7   0\r\n                                  -----------\r\n                                  £2   16   9\r\n                                  ===========\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed there was no horse-hoeing.\r\n\r\n  Second year, barley:              £   s.  d.\r\n\r\n    Rent, tithe, &c.                1   8   0\r\n    Three ploughings                   12   0\r\n    Three harrowings                    1   0\r\n    Seed                                8   0\r\n    Sowing                                  3\r\n    Mowing and harvesting               3   0\r\n    Water furrowing                         6\r\n    Threshing, @ 1s. a quarter          5   0\r\n                                  -----------\r\n                                   £2  17   9\r\n                                  ===========\r\n\r\n  Third year, clover:               £   s.  d.\r\n\r\n    Rent, &c.                       1   8   0\r\n    Seed                                5   0\r\n    Sowing                                  3\r\n                                   ----------\r\n                                   £1  13   3\r\n                                   ==========\r\n\r\n  Fourth year,[452] wheat:          £   s.  d.\r\n\r\n    Rent, &c.                       1   8   0\r\n    One ploughing                       4   0\r\n    Three harrowings                    1   0\r\n    Seed                               10   0\r\n    Sowing                                  3\r\n    Water furrowing                         9\r\n    Thistling                           1   6\r\n    Reaping and harvesting              7   0\r\n    Threshing, @ 2s. a quarter          7   0\r\n                                   ----------\r\n                                   £2  19   6\r\n                                   ==========\r\n\r\n  Fifth year, beans:                £   s.  d.\r\n\r\n    Rent, &c.                       1   8   0\r\n    Two ploughings                      8   0\r\n    Seed, 2 bushels                     8   0\r\n    Sowing                                  6\r\n    Twice hand-hoeing                  12   0\r\n    Twice horse-hoeing                  3   0\r\n    Reaping and harvesting              8   0\r\n    Threshing                           5   0\r\n                                   ----------\r\n                                   £3  12   6\r\n                                   ==========\r\n\r\n  Sixth year, oats:                 £   s.  d.\r\n\r\n    Rent, &c.                       1   8   0\r\n    Once ploughing                      4   0\r\n    Two harrowings                          8\r\n    Four bushels of seed                6   0\r\n    Sowing                                  3\r\n    Mowing and harvesting               3   0\r\n    Threshing, @ 1s. a quarter          6   0\r\n                                   ----------\r\n                                   £2   7  11\r\n                                   ==========\r\n\r\nGood land at a high rent is always better than poor land at a low\r\nrent; the average profit per acre on 5s. land was then about 8s. 8d.,\r\non 20s. land, 29s.\r\n\r\nGrass was much more profitable than tillage, the profit on 20 acres of\r\narable in nine years amounted to £88, whereas on grass it was £212, or\r\n9s. 9d. an acre per annum for the former and 23s. for the latter.[453]\r\nYet dairying, at all events, was then on the whole badly managed and\r\nunprofitable. The average cow ate 2-1/2 acres of grass, and the rent\r\nof this with labour and other expenses made the cost £5 a year per\r\ncow, and its average produce was not worth more than £5 6s. 3d.[454]\r\nThis scanty profit was due to the fact that few farmers used roots,\r\ncabbages, &c., for their cows, and to their wrong management of pigs,\r\nkept on the surplus dairy food.

In\r\nNorthumberland the profit was reckoned at 1s. a head, partly derived\r\nfrom cheese made from ewes' milk. The fleeces averaged 2 lb., and the\r\nwool was so bad as not to be worth more than 3d. or 4d. per lb.[455]\r\n\r\nPigs could be made to pay well, as the following account testifies:\r\n\r\nFood and produce of a sow in one year (1763), which produced seven\r\npigs in April and eleven in October:\r\n\r\n            DR.              £   s.  d.\r\n\r\n  Grains                        10   4\r\n  Cutting a litter               1   6\r\n  5 quarters peas            5   2   0\r\n  10 bushels barley          1   0   0\r\n  Expenses in selling[456]      11   6\r\n  10 bushels peas            1   6   3\r\n                            ----------\r\n                            £8  11   7\r\n                            ==========\r\n\r\n        CR.                 £   s.  d.\r\n\r\n  A pig                         2   3\r\n  A fat hog                 1   9   0\r\n  Another, 110 lb. wt.      1  12   9\r\n  Another, 116 lb. wt.      2   0   0\r\n  Heads                         5   3\r\n  3 fat hogs                6   7   0\r\n  1 fat hog                 2   0   0\r\n  10 young pigs             4  16   6\r\n                          -----------\r\n                          £18   12  9\r\n                            8   11  7\r\n                          -----------\r\n     Profit               £10    1  2\r\n                          ===========\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Young thought little of the 'new husbandry'; he does\r\nnot even give Tull the credit of inventing the drill: 'Mr. Tull\r\nperhaps _again_ invented it. He practised it upon an extent of ground\r\nfar beyond that of any person preceding him: the spirit of drilling\r\ndied with Mr. Tull and was not revived till within a few years.'[457]\r\nIt was doubtful if 50 acres of corn were then annually drilled in\r\nEngland. Lately drilling had been revived and there were keen disputes\r\nas to the old and new methods of husbandry, the efficacy of the new\r\nbeing far from decided. The cause of the slow adoption of drill\r\nhusbandry was the inferiority of the drills hitherto invented. They\r\nwere complex in construction, expensive, and hard to procure. It\r\nseemed impossible to make a drill or drill plough as it was called,\r\nfor such it then was--a combination of drill, plough, and\r\nharrow--capable of sowing at various depths and widths, and at the\r\nsame time light enough for ordinary use. All the drills hitherto made\r\nwere too light to stand the rough use of farm labourers: 'common\r\nploughs and harrows the fellows tumble about in so violent a manner\r\nthat if they were not strength itself they would drop to pieces. In\r\ndrawing such instruments into the field the men generally mount the\r\nhorses, and drag them after them; in passing gateways twenty to one\r\nthey draw them against the gate post.' Some of 'these fellows' are\r\nstill to be seen!\r\n\r\nAnother defect in drilling was that the drill plough filled up all the\r\nwater furrows, which, at a time when drainage was often neglected,\r\nwere deemed of especial importance, and they all had to be opened\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nFurther, said the advocates of the old husbandry, it was a question\r\nwhether all the horse-hoeings, hand-hoeings, and weedings of the new\r\nhusbandry, though undoubtedly beneficial, really paid. It was very\r\nhard to get enough labourers for these operations. With more reason\r\nthey objected to the principles of discarding manure and sowing a\r\nlarge number of white straw crops in succession, but admitted the new\r\nsystem was admirably adapted for beans, turnips, cabbages, and\r\nlucerne.\r\n\r\nHowever, there were many followers of Tull. The Author of\r\n_Dissertations on Rural Subjects_[458] thought the drill plough an\r\nexcellent invention, as it saved seed and facilitated hoeing; but he\r\nsaid Tull's drill was defective in that the distances between the rows\r\ncould not be altered, a defect which the writer claims to have\r\nremedied. Young's desire for a stronger drill seems to have been soon\r\nanswered, as the same writer says the barrel drill invented by\r\nDu-Hamel and improved by Craik was strong, cheap, and easily managed.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the latter half of the century was decidedly in favour\r\nof larger farms; it was a bad thing for the small holders, but it was\r\nan economic tendency which could not be resisted. The larger farmers\r\nhad more capital, were more able and ready to execute improvements;\r\nthey drained their land, others often did not; having sufficient\r\ncapital they were able both to buy and sell to the best advantage and\r\nnot sacrifice their produce at a low price to meet the rent, as the\r\nsmall farmer so often did and does. They could pay better wages and so\r\nget better men, kept more stock and better, and more efficient\r\nimplements. They also had a great advantage in being able by their\r\ngood teams to haul home plenty of purchased manure, which the small\r\nfarmer often could not do. The small tenants, who had no by-industry,\r\nthen, as now, had to work and live harder than the ordinary labourer\r\nto pay their way.\r\n\r\nYoung calculated as early as 1768 that the average size of farms over\r\nthe greater part of England was slightly under 300 acres.[459] In his\r\n_Tour in France_ Young, speaking of the smallness of French farms as\r\ncompared with English ones, and of the consequent great inferiority of\r\nFrench farming, says, 'Where is the little farmer to be found who will\r\ncover his whole farm with marl at the rate of 100 to 150 tons per\r\nacre; who will drain his land at the expense of £2 to £3 an acre; who\r\nwill, to improve the breed of his sheep, give 1,000 guineas for the\r\nuse of a single ram for a single season; who will send across the\r\nkingdom to distant provinces for new implements and for men to use\r\nthem? Deduct from agriculture all the practices that have made it\r\nflourishing in this island, and you have precisely the management of\r\nsmall farms.' In 1868 the _Report of the Commission on the Agriculture\r\nof France_[460] agreed with Young, noting the grave consequences of\r\nthe excessive subdivision of land, loss of time, waste of labour,\r\ndifficulties in rotation of crops, and of liberty of cultivation.\r\n\r\nFor stocking an arable farm of 70 acres Young considered the following\r\nexpenditure necessary, the items of which give us interesting\r\ninformation as to prices about 1770:--\r\n\r\n                                                       £    s.  d.\r\n\r\n  Rent, tithe, and town charges for first year         70   0   0\r\n  Household furniture                                  30   0   0\r\n  Wagon                                                25   0   0\r\n  Cart with ladders                                    12   0   0\r\n  Tumbril                                              10   0   0\r\n  Roller for broad lands (of wood)                      2   0   0\r\n       \"     narrow   \"      \"                          1  15   0\r\n  Cart harness for 4 horses                             8  17   0\r\n  Plough     \"     \"                                    2  16   0\r\n  2 ploughs                                             3   0   0\r\n  A pair of harrows                                     1  15   0\r\n  Screen, bushel, fan, sieves, forks, rakes, &c.        8   0   0\r\n  Dairy furniture                                       3   0   0\r\n  20 sacks                                              2  10   0\r\n  4 horses                                             32   0   0\r\n  Wear and tear, and shoeing one year                  13   0   0\r\n  Keep of 4 horses from Michaelmas to May Day, @\r\n      2s. 6d. each a week                              14   0   0\r\n  5 cows                                               20   0   0\r\n  20 sheep                                              5  10   0\r\n  One sow                                                  15   0\r\n  One servant's board and wages for one year           15   0   0\r\n  A labourer's wages for one year                      20   0   0\r\n  Seed for first year, 42 acres, @ 11s. 6d.            24   3   0\r\n  Harvest labour                                        1  10   0\r\n                                                     ------------\r\n                                                     £326  11   0\r\n                                                     ============\r\n\r\nOr nearly £5 an acre.\r\n\r\nAbout the same date the _Complete English Farmer_ reckoned that the\r\noccupier of a farm of 500 acres (300 arable, 200 pasture), ought to\r\nhave a capital of £1,500, and estimated that, after paying expenses\r\nand maintaining his family, he could put by £50 a year; 'but this\r\ncapital was much beyond what farmers in general can attain to.'[461]\r\n\r\nThe controversy of horses versus oxen for working purposes was still\r\nraging, and Young favoured the use of oxen; for the food of horses\r\ncost more, so did their harness and their shoeing, they are much more\r\nliable to disease, and oxen when done with could be sold for beef. One\r\nstout lad, moreover, could attend to 8 or 10 oxen, for all he had to\r\ndo was to put their fodder in the racks and clean the shed; no\r\nrubbing, no currying or dressing being necessary. No beasts fattened\r\nbetter than oxen that had been worked. A yoke of oxen would plough as\r\nmuch as a pair of horses and carry a deeper and truer furrow, while\r\nthey were just as handy as horses in wagons, carts, rollers, &c.\r\nWilliam Marshall, the other great agricultural writer of the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century, agreed with Young, yet in spite of all these\r\nadvantages horses were continually supplanting oxen.\r\n\r\nAmong the improvements in agriculture was the introduction of\r\nbroad-wheeled wagons; narrow-wheeled ones were usual, and these on the\r\nturnpikes were only allowed to be drawn by 4 horses so that the load\r\nwas small, but broad-wheeled wagons might use 8 horses. The cost of\r\nthe latter was £50 against £25 for the former.[462]\r\n\r\nYoung's opinion of the labouring man, like Tull's, was not a high one.\r\n'I never yet knew', he says, 'one instance of any poor man's working\r\ndiligently while young and in health to escape coming to the parish\r\nwhen ill or old.' This is doubtless too sweeping. There must have been\r\nothers like George Barwell, whom Marshall tells of in his _Rural\r\nEconomy of the Midlands_, who had brought up a family of five or six\r\nsons and daughters on a wage of 5s. to 7s. a week, and after they were\r\nout in the world saved enough to support him in his old age. The\r\nmajority, however, long before the crushing times of the French War,\r\nseem to have been thoroughly demoralized by indiscriminate parish\r\nrelief, and habitually looked to the parish to maintain them in\r\nsickness and old age. Cullum[463] a few years later, remarks on the\r\npoor demanding assistance without the scruple and delicacy they used\r\nto have, and says 'the present age seems to aim at abolishing all\r\nsubordination and dependence and reducing all ranks as near a level as\r\npossible.'! Idleness, drunkenness, and what was then often looked on\r\nwith disgust and contempt, excessive tea-drinking, were rife. Tea then\r\nwas very expensive, 8s. or 10s. a lb. being an ordinary price, so that\r\nthe poor had to put up with a very much adulterated article, most\r\npernicious to health. The immoderate use of this was stated to have\r\nworse effects than the immoderate use of spirits. The consumption of\r\nit was largely caused by the deficiency of the milk supply, owing to\r\nthe decrease of small farms; the large farmers did not retail such\r\nsmall commodities as milk and butter, but sent them to the towns so\r\nthat the poor often went without.[464]\r\n\r\nIn 1767 Young found wages differing according to the distance from\r\nLondon[465]:--\r\n\r\n                                                     s.  d.\r\n\r\n       20 miles from London they were per week      10   9\r\n  From 20 to 60       \"       \"       \"              7   8\r\n   \"   60 to 110      \"       \"       \"              6   4\r\n   \"  110 to 170      \"       \"       \"              6   3\r\n\r\nGiving an average of 7s. 9d. which, however, was often exceeded as\r\nthere was much piece-work which enabled the men to earn more.\r\n\r\nYoung drew up a dietary for a labourer, his wife, and a family of\r\nthree children, which he declared to be sufficient:--\r\n\r\n                                                         £  s.  d.\r\n\r\n  Food, 6s. per week[466]; per year                     15  12  0\r\n  Rent                                                   1  10  0\r\n  Clothes                                                2  10  0\r\n  Soap and candles                                       1   5  0\r\n  Loss of time through illness, and medicine             1   0  0\r\n  Fuel                                                   2   0  0\r\n                                                       ----------\r\n                                                       £23  17  0\r\n                                                       ==========\r\n\r\n                                                         £  s.  d.\r\n\r\n  The man's wages were, @ 1s. 3d. a day, for the year   19  10  0\r\n  The woman's, @ 3-3/4d. a day, for the year             4  17  6\r\n  The boy of fifteen could earn                          9   0  0\r\n  The boy of ten could earn                              4   7  6\r\n                                                       ----------\r\n                                                       £37  15  0\r\n                                                       ==========\r\n\r\nWhich would give the family a surplus of £13 18s. 0d. a year.\r\n\r\nWhat the man's food should consist of is shown by a list of 'seven\r\ndays' messes for a stout man':--\r\n\r\n                                                              s. d.\r\n\r\n  1st day.  2 lb. of bread made of wheat, rye, and\r\n              potatoes--'no bread exceeds it'                 2\r\n            Cheese, 2 oz. @ 4d. a lb                            1/2\r\n            Beer, 2 quarts                                    1\r\n  2nd day.

However, the bread he recommends\r\nwas not that eaten by a large number of them. Eden[467] states that in\r\n1764 about half the people of England were estimated to be using\r\nwheaten bread, and at the end of the century, although prices had\r\nrisen greatly, he says that in the Home Counties wheaten bread was\r\nuniversal among the peasant class. Young, indeed, acknowledges that\r\nmany insisted on wheaten bread.[468] In Suffolk, according to\r\nCullum,[469] pork and bacon were the labourer's delicacies, bread and\r\ncheese his ordinary diet.\r\n\r\nThe north of England was more thrifty than the south. At the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century barley and oaten bread were much used there.\r\nLancashire people fed largely on oat bread, leavened and unleavened;\r\nthe 33rd Regiment, which went by the name of the 'Havercake lads', was\r\nusually recruited from the West Riding where oat bread was in common\r\nuse, and was famous for having fine men in its ranks.[470] The\r\nlabourers of the north were also noted for their skill in making soups\r\nin which barley was an important ingredient. In many of the southern\r\ncounties tea was drunk at breakfast, dinner, and supper by the poor,\r\noften without milk or sugar; but alcoholic liquors were also consumed\r\nin great quantities, the southerner apparently always drinking a\r\nconsiderable amount, the northerner at rare intervals drinking deep.\r\nThe drinking in cider counties seems always to have been worse as far\r\nas quantity goes than elsewhere, and the drink bills on farms were\r\nenormous. Marshall says that in Gloucestershire drinking a gallon\r\n'bottle', generally a little wooden barrel, at a draught was no\r\nuncommon feat; and in the Vale of Evesham a labourer who wanted to be\r\neven with his master for short payment emptied a two-gallon bottle\r\nwithout taking it from his lips. Even this feat was excelled by 'four\r\nwell-seasoned yeomen, who resolved to have a fresh hogshead tapped,\r\nand setting foot to foot emptied it at one sitting.'[471] Yet in the\r\nbeer-drinking counties great quantities were consumed; a gallon a day\r\nper man all the year round being no uncommon allowance.[472]\r\n\r\nThe superior thrift of the north was shown in clothes as well as food,\r\nthe midland and southern labourer at the end of the century buying all\r\nhis clothes, the northerner making them almost all at home; there were\r\nmany respectable families in the north who had never bought a pair of\r\nstockings, coat, or waistcoat in their lives, and a purchased coat was\r\nconsidered a mark of extravagance and pride.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable feature of Young's dietary is that green\r\nvegetables are absolutely ignored. The peasant was supposed to need\r\nthem as little as in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nHowever, Young admits that very few labourers lived as cheaply as\r\nthis, and he found the actual ordinary budget for the same family to\r\nbe:--\r\n\r\n                                         £   s. d.\r\n\r\n  Food, per week, 7s. 6d.; per year     19  10  0\r\n  Beer      \"     1s. 6d.     \"          3  18  0\r\n  Soap and candles                       1   5  0\r\n  Rent                                   1  10  0\r\n  Clothes                                2  10  0\r\n  Fuel                                   2   0  0\r\n  Illness, &c.                           1   0  0\r\n  Infant                                 2  12  0\r\n                                       ----------\r\n                                       £34   5  0\r\n                                       ==========\r\n\r\nThis, with the same Income as before, left him with a surplus of £3\r\n10s. 0d.; but as it was not likely his wife could work all the year\r\nround, or that both his eldest children should be boys, it appears\r\nthat his expenses must often have exceeded his income. This being so,\r\nit is not surprising that he was often drunken and reckless, and ready\r\nto come on the parish for relief. To labour incessantly, often with\r\nwife and boys, to live very poorly, yet not even make both ends meet,\r\nwas enough to kill all spirit in any one.\r\n\r\nA great evil from which the labourer suffered was the restrictions\r\nthrown on him of settling in another parish. If he desired to take his\r\nlabour to a better market he often found it closed to him. His\r\nmarriage was discouraged,[473] because a single man did not want a\r\ncottage and a married one did. To ease the rates there was open war\r\nagainst cottages, and many were pulled down.[474] If a labourer in a\r\nparish to which he did not legally belong signified his intention of\r\nmarrying, he immediately had notice to quit the parish and retire to\r\nhis own, unless he could procure a certificate that neither he nor his\r\nwould be chargeable. If he went to his own parish he came off very\r\nbadly, for they didn't want him, and cottages being scarce he probably\r\nhad to put up with sharing one with one or more families. Sensible men\r\ncried out for the total abolition of the poor laws, the worst effects\r\nof which were still to be felt.\r\n\r\nYet there was a considerable migration of labour at harvest time when\r\nadditional hands were needed. Labourers came from neighbouring\r\ncounties, artisans left their workshops in the towns, Scots came to\r\nthe Northern counties, Welshmen to the western, and Irishmen appeared\r\nin many parts; and they were as a rule supplied by a contractor.[475]\r\n\r\nLondon was regarded as a source of great evil to the country by\r\nattracting the young and energetic thither. It used, men said, to be\r\nno such easy matter to get there when a stage coach was four or five\r\ndays creeping 100 miles and fares were high; but in 1770 a country\r\nfellow 100 miles from London jumped on a coach in the morning and for\r\n8s. or 10s. got to town by night, 'and ten times the boasts are\r\nsounded in the ears of country fools by those who have seen London to\r\ninduce them to quit their healthy clean fields for a region of dirt,\r\nstink, and noise.' A prejudice might well have been entertained\r\nagainst the metropolis at this time, for it literally devoured the\r\npeople of England, the deaths exceeding the births by 8,000 a year.\r\nOne of the causes that had hitherto kept people from London was the\r\ndread of the small-pox, but that was now said to be removed by\r\ninoculation. Among the troubles farmers had to contend with were the\r\naudacious depredations caused by poachers, generally labourers, who\r\nswarmed in many villages. They took the farmer's horses out of his\r\nfields after they had done a hard day's work and rode them all night\r\nto drive the game into their nets, blundering over the hedges,\r\nsometimes staking the horses, riding over standing corn, or anything\r\nthat was cover for partridges, and when they had sold their ill-gotten\r\ngame spent the money openly at the nearest alehouse. Then they would\r\ngo back and work for the farmers they had robbed, drunk, asleep, or\r\nidle the whole day. The subscription packs of foxhounds were also a\r\ngreat nuisance, many of the followers being townsmen who bored through\r\nhedges and smashed the gates and stiles, conduct not unknown to-day.\r\nIn spite of these drawbacks the long period of great abundance from\r\n1715 to 1765 and the consequent cheapness of food with an increase of\r\nwages was attended with a great improvement in the condition and habits\r\nof the people. Adam Smith refers to 'the peculiarly happy circumstances\r\nof the country'; Hallam described the reign of George II as 'the most\r\nprosperous period that England has ever experienced'[476]; and it was\r\nYoung's opinion about 1770 that England was in a most rich and\r\nflourishing situation, 'her agriculture is upon the whole good and\r\nspirited and every day improving, her industrious poor are well fed,\r\nclothed, and lodged at reasonable rates, the prices of all necessaries\r\nbeing moderate, our population increasing, the price of labour\r\ngenerally high.'[477] The great degree of luxury to which the country\r\nhad arrived within a few years 'is not only astonishing but almost\r\ndreadful to think of. Time was when those articles of indulgence which\r\nnow every mechanic aims at the possession of were enjoyed only by the\r\nbaron or lord.'[478] Great towns became the winter residence of those\r\nwho could not afford London, and the country was said to be everywhere\r\ndeserted, an evil largely attributed to the improvement of posting and\r\ncoaches. The true country gentleman was seldom to be found, the\r\nluxuries of the age had softened down the hardy roughness of former\r\ntimes and the 'country, like the capital, is one scene of dissipation.'\r\nThe private gentleman of £300 or £400 a year must have his horses,\r\ndogs, carriages, pictures, and parties, and thus goes to ruin. The\r\narticles of living, says the same writer, were 100 per cent. dearer\r\nthan some time back. This is a very different picture from that in\r\nwhich Young represents every one rushing into farming, but no doubt\r\ndepicts one phase of national life.\r\n\r\nAn excellent observer[479] noticed in 1792 that the preceding forty or\r\nfifty years had witnessed the total destruction in England of the once\r\ncommon type of the small country squire. He was:--\r\n\r\n     'An independent gentleman of £300 per annum who commonly\r\n     appeared in a plain drab or plush coat, large silver buttons, a\r\n     jockey cap, and rarely without boots. His travels never\r\n     exceeded the distance of the county town, and that only at\r\n     assize or session time, or to attend an election. Once a week\r\n     he commonly dined at the next market town with the attorneys\r\n     and justices. He went to church regularly, read the weekly\r\n     journal, settled the parochial disputes, and afterwards\r\n     adjourned to the neighbouring alehouse, where he generally got\r\n     drunk for the good of his country. He was commonly followed by\r\n     a couple of greyhounds and a pointer, and announced his arrival\r\n     at a neighbour's house by smacking his whip and giving a view\r\n     halloo. His drink was generally ale, except on Christmas Day,\r\n     the Fifth of November, or some other gala day, when he would\r\n     make a bowl of strong brandy. The mansion of one of these\r\n     squires was of plaster striped with timber, not unaptly called\r\n     callimanco work, or of red brick with large casemented bow\r\n     windows; a porch with seats in it and over it a study: the\r\n     eaves of the house well inhabited by swallows, and the court\r\n     set round with hollyhocks; near the gate a horse-block for\r\n     mounting. The hall was furnished with flitches of bacon, and\r\n     the mantelpiece with guns and fishing-rods of different\r\n     dimensions, accompanied by the broadsword, partisan, and dagger\r\n     borne by his ancestor in the Civil Wars. Against the wall was\r\n     posted King Charles's _Golden Rules_, Vincent Wing's _Almanac_\r\n     and a portrait of the Duke of Marlborough; in his window lay\r\n     Baker's _Chronicle_, Foxe's _Book of Martyrs_, Glanvill _On\r\n     Apparitions_, Quincey's _Dispensatory_, _The Complete Justice_,\r\n     and a _Book of Farriery_. In a corner by the fireside stood a\r\n     large wooden two-armed chair with a cushion, and within the\r\n     chimney corner were a couple of seats. Here at Christmas he\r\n     entertained his tenants, assembled round a glowing fire made of\r\n     the roots of trees; and told and heard the traditionary tales\r\n     of the village about ghosts and witches while a jorum of ale\r\n     went round. These men and their houses are no more.'\r\n\r\nThe farmer, in some parts at all events, was becoming a more civilized\r\nindividual; the late race had lived in the midst of their enlightened\r\nneighbours like beings of another order[480]; in their personal labour\r\nthey were indefatigable, in their fare hard, in their dress homely, in\r\ntheir manners rude. The French and American War of 1775-83 was a very\r\nprosperous time, and the farmer's mode of living greatly improved.\r\nFarmhouses in England, it was noticed, were in general well furnished\r\nwith every convenient accommodation. Into many of them a 'barometer\r\nhad of late years been introduced'. The teapot and the mug of ale\r\njointly possessed the breakfast table, and meat and pudding smoked on\r\nthe board every noon. Formerly one might see at church what was the\r\ncut of a coat half a century ago, now dress was spruce and\r\nmodern.[481] As a proof of the spirit of improvement among farmers,\r\nMarshall instances the custom in the Midlands of placing their sons as\r\npupils on other farms to widen their experience. 'Their entertainments\r\nare as expensive as they are elegant, for it is no uncommon thing for\r\none of these new-created farmers to spend £10 or £12, at one\r\nentertainment, and to have the most expensive wines; to set off the\r\nentertainment in the greatest splendour an elegant sideboard of plate\r\nis provided in the newest fashion.'[482] As to dress, no one could\r\ntell the farmer's daughter from the duke's. Marshall noticed that in\r\nWarwickshire the harness of the farmer's teams was often ridiculously\r\nornamented, and the horses were overfed and underworked to save their\r\nlooks. Before enclosure the farmer entertained his friends with bacon\r\nfed by himself, washed down with ale brewed from his own malt, in a\r\nbrown jug, or a glass if he was extravagant. He wore a coat of woollen\r\nstuff, the growth of his own flock, spun by his wife and daughters,\r\nhis stockings came from the same quarter, so did the clothes of his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nSome of these farmers were doing their share in helping the progress\r\nof agriculture. In 1764 Joseph Elkington, of Princethorpe in\r\nWarwickshire, was the first to practise the under drainage of sloping\r\nland that was drowned by the bursting of springs. He drained some\r\nfields at Princethorpe which were very wet, and dug a trench 4 or 5\r\nfeet deep for this purpose; but finding this did not reach the\r\nprincipal body of subjacent water, he drove an iron bar 4 feet below\r\nthe bottom of his trench and on withdrawing it the water gushed out.\r\nHe was thus led to combine the system of cutting drains, aided when\r\nnecessary by auger holes. His main principles were three: (1) Finding\r\nthe main spring, or cause of the mischief. (2) Taking the level of\r\nthat spring and ascertaining its subterranean bearings, for if the\r\ndrain is cut a yard below the line of the spring the water issuing\r\nfrom it cannot be reached, but on ascertaining the line by levelling\r\nthe spring can be cut effectually. (3) Using the auger to tap the\r\nspring when the drain was not deep enough for the purpose.[483] It was\r\nowing to the Board of Agriculture at the end of the century that he\r\nobtained the vote of £1,000 from Parliament, and a skilful surveyor\r\nwas appointed to observe his methods and give them to the public, for\r\nhe was too ignorant himself to give an intelligible account of his\r\nsystem. After the publication of the report his system was followed\r\ngenerally until Smith of Deanston in 1835 gave the method now in use\r\nto his country.\r\n\r\nRobert Bakewell, who did more to improve live stock than any other\r\nman, was born at Dishley, Leicestershire, in 1735, and succeeding to\r\nthe management of his father's farm in 1760 began to make experiments\r\nin breeding.[484] He scorned the old idea that the blood must be\r\nconstantly varied by the mixture of different breeds, and his new\r\nsystem differed from the old in two chief points: (1) small versus\r\nlarge bone, and consequently a greater proportion of flesh and a\r\ngreater tendency to fatten; (2) permissible in-breeding versus\r\nperpetual crossing with strange breeds. He took immense pains in\r\nselecting the best animals to breed from, and had at Dishley a museum\r\nof skeletons and pickled specimens for the comparison of one\r\ngeneration with another, and he conducted careful post-mortem\r\nexaminations on his stock. His great production was the new Leicester\r\nbreed of sheep,[485] which in half a century spread over every part of\r\nthe United Kingdom, as well as to Europe and America, and gave England\r\n2 lb. of meat where she had one before. Sheep at this time were\r\ndivided into two main classes: (1) short-woolled or field sheep, fed\r\nin the open fields; (2) long-woolled or pasture sheep, fed in\r\nenclosures. That they were not at a very high state of perfection may\r\nbe gathered from this description of the chief variety of the latter,\r\nthe 'Warwickshire' breed: 'his frame large and loose, his bones heavy,\r\nhis legs long and thick, his chine as well as his rump as sharp as a\r\nhatchet, his skin rattling on his ribs like a skeleton covered with\r\nparchments.' The origin of the new Leicester sheep is uncertain, but\r\napparently the old Lincoln breed was the basis of it, though this,\r\nlike other large breeds of English sheep, was itself an introduction\r\nof the last half century. The new sheep was described as having a\r\nclean head, straight broad flat back, barrel-like body, fine small\r\neyes, thin feet, mutton fat, fine-grained and of good flavour, wool 8\r\nlb. to the fleece, and wethers at two years old weighed from 20 to 30\r\nlb. a quarter.\r\n\r\nBy 1770 his rams were hired for 25 guineas a season, and soon after he\r\nmade £3,000 a year by their hire, one named 'Two-pounder' bringing him\r\n1,200 guineas in one year.\r\n\r\nOne of his theories was that the poorer the land the more it demanded\r\nwell-made sheep, which is no doubt true to a certain extent; but it\r\nhas been proved conclusively since that the quality of the breed\r\ngradually drops to the level of the land unless artificially assisted.\r\nAt his death he left two distinct breeds of sheep, for he improved on\r\nhis own new Leicester, so that the improved became the 'New Leicester'\r\nand the former the 'Old Leicester.' However, at the time and,\r\nafterwards, his sheep were generally called 'New Leicesters', and\r\nsometimes the 'Dishley breed'. There was much prejudice among farmers\r\nagainst the new breed; in the Midlands most of the farmers would have\r\nnothing to do with them, and 'their grounds were stocked with\r\ncreatures that would disgrace the meanest lands in the kingdom.' Yet\r\nin April, 1786, yearling wethers of the new breed were sold for 28s.\r\nwhile those of the old were 16s.\r\n\r\nThe cattle which he set to work to improve were the famous old longhorn\r\nbreed, the prevailing breed of the Midlands, which had already been\r\nconsiderably improved by Webster of Canley in Warwickshire, and\r\nothers, especially in Lancashire and the north. The kind of cattle\r\nesteemed hitherto had been 'the large, long-bodied, big-boned, coarse,\r\nflat-sided kind, and often lyery or black-fleshed.'[486] He founded\r\nhis herd upon two heifers of Webster's and a bull from Westmoreland,\r\nand from these bred all his cattle. The celebrated bull 'Twopenny' was\r\na son of the Westmoreland bull and one of these heifers, who came to\r\nbe celebrated in agricultural history as 'Old Comely', for she was\r\nslaughtered at the age of twenty-six. He bred his cattle so that they\r\nproduced an enormous amount of fat, as hitherto there had been a\r\ndifficulty in producing animals to fatten readily; but this he pushed\r\nto too great an extreme, so that there has been a reaction. The\r\nfollowing is a description of a six-year-old bull, got by 'Twopenny'\r\nout of a Canley cow: 'His head, chest, and neck remarkably fine and\r\nclean; his chest extraordinarily deep; his brisket bearing down to his\r\nknees; his chine thin, loin narrow at the chine, but remarkably wide\r\nat the hips. Quarters long, round bones snug, but thighs rather full\r\nand remarkably let down. The carcase throughout, chine excepted,\r\nlarge, roomy, deep, and well spread.'[487] The new longhorn, however\r\ngood for the grazier, was not a good milker. Bakewell was a great\r\nbeliever in straw as a food, and strongly objected to having it\r\ntrodden into manure; his beasts were largely fed on it, in such small\r\nquantities that they greedily ate what was before them and wasted\r\nlittle. His activity was not confined to the breeding of cattle and\r\nsheep, for he also produced a breed of black horses, thick and short\r\nin the body, with very short legs and very powerful, two ploughing 4\r\nacres a day, a statement which seems much exaggerated; and was famous\r\nfor his skill in irrigating meadows, by which he could cut grass four\r\ntimes a year. He was a firm believer in the wisdom of treating stock\r\ngently and kindly, and his sheep were kept as clean as racehorses. A\r\nvisitor to Dishley saw a bull of huge proportions, with enormous\r\nhorns, led about by a boy of seven. He travelled much, and admired the\r\nfarms of Norfolk most in England, and those of Holland and Flanders\r\nabroad, founding his own system on these. It was his opinion that the\r\nDevon breed of cattle were incapable of improvement by a cross of any\r\nother breed, and that from the West Highland heifer the best breed of\r\ncattle might be produced.\r\n\r\nHe died in 1795, and apparently did not keep what he made, owing\r\nlargely to his boundless hospitality, which had entertained Russian\r\nprinces, German royal dukes, English peers, and travellers from all\r\ncountries. His breed of cattle has completely disappeared, unless\r\ntraces survive in the lately resuscitated longhorn breed, but his\r\nprinciples are still acted upon, viz. the correlation of form, and the\r\npractice of consanguineous breeding under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nBakewell's earliest pupil was George Culley, who devoted himself to\r\nimproving the breed of cattle, and became one of the most famous\r\nagriculturists at the end of the eighteenth and the commencement of\r\nthe nineteenth centuries. Another farmer to whom English agriculture\r\nowes much was John Ellman of Glynde, born in 1753, who by careful\r\nselection firmly established the reputation of the Southdown sheep\r\nwhich had previously been hardly recognized. He was one of the\r\nfounders of the Smithfield Cattle Show in 1793, which helped\r\nmaterially to improve the live stock of the country.\r\n\r\nThe relations between landlord and tenant, judging from the accounts\r\nof contemporary writers, were generally good. Leases were less\r\nfrequent than agreements voidable by six months' notice on either\r\nside, and when there was a tenancy-at-will the tenant who entered as a\r\nyoung man was often expected to hand on the holding to his posterity,\r\nand therefore executed improvements at his own cost, so complete was\r\nthe trust between landlord and tenant. Tenants then did much that they\r\nwould refuse to do to-day, as the following lease, common in the\r\nMidlands in 1786, shows[488]:\r\n\r\n  Tenant agrees to take, &c., and to pay the stipulated rent\r\n    within forty days, without any deduction for taxes, and\r\n    double rent so long as he continues to hold after notice\r\n    given.\r\n\r\n  To repair buildings, accidents by fire excepted.\r\n\r\n  To repair gates and fences.\r\n\r\n  When required, to cut and plash the hedges, and make the\r\n    ditches 3 feet by 2 feet, or pay or cause to be paid to\r\n    the landlord 1s. per rood for such as shall not be done\r\n    after three months' notice has been given in writing.\r\n\r\n  Not to break up certain lands specified in the schedule,\r\n    'under £20 an acre.'\r\n\r\n  Not to plough more than a specified number of acres of the\r\n    rest of the land in any one year, under the same penalty.\r\n\r\n  To forfeit the same sum for every acre that shall be ploughed\r\n    for any longer time than three crops successively, without\r\n    making a clean summer fallow thereof after the third\r\n    crop.\r\n\r\n  And the like sum for every acre over and above a specified\r\n    number (clover excepted) that shall be mown in any one\r\n    year.\r\n\r\n  At the time of laying down arable lands to grass he shall\r\n    manure them with 8 quarters of lime per acre, and sow\r\n    the same with 12 lb. of clover seeds, and one bushel of\r\n    rye-grass per acre.\r\n\r\n  Shall spend on the premises all hay, straw, and manure, or\r\n      leave them at the end of the term.\r\n\r\n  Tenant on quitting to be allowed for hay left on the premises,\r\n      for clover and rye-grass sown in the last year, and for all\r\n      fallows made within that time.'[489]\r\n\r\nA striking picture of the conditions prevailing in many parts of\r\nEngland at this period is given by Mr. Loch in his account of the\r\nestates of the Marquis of Stafford.[490] When this nobleman inherited\r\nhis property in Staffordshire and Shropshire, much of the land, as in\r\nother parts of England, was held on leases for three lives, a system\r\nsaid to have been ruinous in its effects. Although the farms were held\r\nat one-third of their value, nothing could be worse than the course of\r\ncultivation pursued, no improvements were carried out, and all that\r\ncould be hoped for was that the land would not be entirely run out\r\nwhen the lease expired. The closes were extremely small and of the\r\nmost irregular shape; the straggling fences occupied a large portion\r\nof the land; the crookedness of the ditches, by keeping the water\r\nstagnant, added to, rather than relieved, the wetness of the soil.\r\nFarms were much scattered, and to enable the occupiers to get at their\r\nland, lanes wound backwards and forwards from field to field, covering\r\na large quantity of ground.\r\n\r\nIt is to the great credit of the Marquis of Stafford that this\r\nmiserable state of things was swept away. Lands were laid together,\r\nthe size of the fields enlarged, hedges and ditches straightened, the\r\ndrainage conducted according to a uniform plan, new and substantial\r\nbuildings erected, indeed the whole countryside transformed.\r\n\r\nAnother evil custom on the estate had been to permit huts of miserable\r\nconstruction to be erected to the number of several hundreds by the\r\npoorest, and in many instances the most profligate, of the population.\r\nThey were not regularly entered in the rental account, but had a\r\nnominal payment fixed upon them which was paid annually at the court\r\nleet. These cottages were built on the sides of the roads and on the\r\nlord's waste, which was gradually absorbed by the encroachment, which\r\nthe occupiers of these huts made from time to time by enclosing the\r\nland that lay next them. These wretched holdings gradually fell into\r\nthe hands of a body of middlemen, who underlet them at an extravagant\r\nrent to the occupiers; and these men began to consider that they had\r\nan interest independent of the landlord, and had at times actually\r\nmortgaged, sold, and devised it. This abuse was also put an end to,\r\nthe cottagers being made immediate tenants of the landlord, to their\r\ngreat gain, but to this day small aggregations of houses in Shropshire\r\ncalled 'Heaths' mark the encroachments of these squatters on the\r\nroadside wastes. This class, indeed, has been well known in England\r\nsince the Middle Ages. Norden speaks of them in 1602, and so do many\r\nsubsequent writers. Numbers of small holdings exist to-day obtained in\r\nthis manner, and the custom must to some extent have counteracted the\r\neffect of enclosure.[491]\r\n\r\nThe roads of England up to the end of the eighteenth century were\r\ngenerally in a disgraceful condition. Some improvement was effected in\r\nthe latter half of the century, but it was not until the days of\r\nTelford and Macadam that they assumed the appearance with which we are\r\nfamiliar; and long after that, though the main roads were excellent,\r\nthe by-roads were often atrocious, as readers of such books as\r\n_Handley Cross_, written in the middle of the nineteenth century, will\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nDefoe in his tour in 1724 found the road between S. Albans and\r\nNottingham 'perfectly frightful,' and the great number of horses\r\nkilled by the 'labour of these heavy ways a great charge to the\r\ncountry'. He notes, however, an improvement from turnpikes. Many of\r\nthe roads were much worn by the continual passing of droves of heavy\r\ncattle on their way to London. Sheep could not travel in the winter to\r\nLondon as the roads were too heavy, so that the price of mutton at\r\nthat season in town was high. Breeders were often compelled to sell\r\nthem cheap before they got to London, because the roads became\r\nimpassable for their flocks when the bad weather set in.[492]\r\n\r\nIn 1734 Lord Cathcart wrote in his diary: 'All went well until I\r\narrived within 3 miles of Doncaster, when suddenly my horse fell with\r\na crash and with me under him. I fancied myself crushed to death. I\r\nslept at Doncaster and had a bad night. I was so bad all day, that I\r\ncould get no further than Wetherby. Next day I was all right again. I\r\nhad another terrible fall between North Allerton and Darlington, but\r\nwas not a bit the worse.'[493]\r\n\r\nIt was owing to this defective condition of the roads that the prices\r\nof corn still differed greatly in various localities; there would be a\r\nglut in one place and a deficiency in another, with no means of\r\nequalizing matters. To the same cause must be attributed in great\r\nmeasure the slow progress made in the improvement of agriculture. New\r\ndiscoveries travelled very slowly; the expense of procuring manure\r\nbeyond that produced on the farm was prohibitive; and the uncertain\r\nreturns which arose from such confined markets caused the farmer to\r\nlack both spirit and ability to exert himself in the cultivation of\r\nhis land.[494] Therefore farming was limited to procuring the\r\nsubsistence of particular farms rather than feeding the public. The\r\nopposition to better roads was due in great measure to the landowners,\r\nwho feared that if the markets in their neighbourhood were rendered\r\naccessible to distant farmers their estates would suffer. But they\r\nwere not alone in their opposition; in the reign of Queen Anne the\r\npeople of Northampton were against any improvement in the navigation\r\nof the Nene, because they feared that corn from Huntingdon and\r\nCambridge would come up the river and spoil their market.[495] Horner\r\nwas very enthusiastic over the improvement recently effected: 'our\r\nvery carriages travel with almost winged expedition between every town\r\nof consequence in the kingdom and the metropolis' and inland\r\nnavigation was soon likely to be established in every part, in\r\nconsequence of which the demand for the produce of the land increased\r\nand the land itself became more valuable and rents rose. 'There never\r\nwas a more astonishing revolution accomplished in the internal system\r\nof any country'; and the carriage of grain was effected with half the\r\nformer number of horses.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, however, that he was easily satisfied, and this opinion\r\nmust be compared with the statements of Young and Marshall, who were\r\ncontinually travelling all over England some time after it was\r\nwritten, and found the roads, in many parts, in a very bad state.\r\n\r\nEven near London they were often terrible. 'Of all the cursed roads\r\nthat ever disgraced this kingdom in the very ages of barbarism, none\r\never equalled that from Billericay to the King's Head at Tilbury.[496]\r\nIt is for near 12 miles so narrow that a mouse cannot pass by any\r\ncarriage. I saw a fellow creep under his wagon to assist me to lift,\r\nif possible, my chaise over a hedge. The ruts are of an incredible\r\ndepth, and everywhere chalk wagons were stuck fast till 20 or 30\r\nhorses tacked to each drew them out one by one' Others said that\r\nturnpike roads were the enemies of cheapness; as soon as they opened\r\nup secluded spots, low prices vanished and all tended to one level.\r\nOwing to the work of Telford and Macadam, the high roads by the first\r\nquarter of the nineteenth century attained a high pitch of excellence;\r\nand were thronged with traffic, coaches, postchaises, private\r\ncarriages, equestrians, carts and wagons: so animated a sight that our\r\nforefathers built small houses called 'gazebos' on the sides of the\r\nroad, where they met to take tea and watch the ever varying stream. It\r\nshould not be forgotten, too, that the inns, where numbers of horses\r\nput up, were splendid markets for the farmers' oats, hay, and straw.\r\n\r\nThe seasons in the latter part of the eighteenth century were\r\ndistinguished for being frequently bad. In 1774 Gilbert White wrote,\r\n'Such a run of wet seasons as we have had the last ten or eleven years\r\nwould have produced a famine a century or two ago.' Owing to the\r\ndearness of bread in 1767 riots broke out in many places, many lives\r\nwere lost, and the gaols were filled with prisoners.[497] 1779 was,\r\nhowever, a year of great fertility and prices were low all round:\r\nwheat 33s. 8d., barley 26s., oats 13s. 6d., wool 12s. a tod of 28 lb.:\r\nand there were many complaints of ruined farmers and distressed\r\nlandlords. Though England was now becoming an importing country, the\r\namount of corn imported was insufficient to have any appreciable\r\neffect on prices, which were mainly influenced by the seasons, as the\r\nfollowing instance of the fluctuations caused by a single bad season\r\n(1782) testifies[498]:\r\n\r\n  Prices after harvest of 1781.      Prices after harvest of 1782.\r\n\r\n                         £ s. d.                             £  s. d.\r\n\r\n  Wheat, per bushel        5  0       Wheat, per bushel        10  6\r\n  Barley     \"             2  9       Barley     \"              7  2\r\n  Dutch oats for seed      1  8       Dutch oats for seed       3  6\r\n  Clover seed, per cwt. 1 11  6       Clover seed, per cwt.  5 10  0\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1783 was amazing and portentous and full of horrible\r\nphenomena, according to White, with a peculiar haze or smoky fog\r\nprevailing for many weeks. 'The sun at noon looked as blank as a\r\nclouded moon, and shed a rust-coloured ferruginous light on the ground\r\nand floors of rooms.' This was succeeded by a very severe winter, the\r\nthermometer on December 10 being 1° below zero; the worst since\r\n1739-40.\r\n\r\nIn 1788 occurred a severe drought in the summer, 5,000 horned cattle\r\nperishing for lack of water.[499] In 1791 there was a remarkable\r\nchange of temperature in the middle of June, the thermometer in a few\r\ndays falling from 75° to 25°, and the hills of Kent and Surrey were\r\ncovered with snow.\r\n\r\nWe have now to deal with one of those landowners whose great example\r\nis one of the glories of English agriculture. Coke of Holkham began\r\nhis great agricultural work about 1776 on an estate where, as old Lady\r\nTownshend said, 'all you will see will be one blade of grass and two\r\nrabbits fighting for that;' in fact it was little better than a rabbit\r\nwarren. It has been said that all the wheat consumed in the county of\r\nNorfolk was at this time imported from abroad; but this is in direct\r\ncontradiction to Young's assertion, already noted, that there were in\r\n1767 great quantities of wheat besides other crops in the county.\r\nCoke's estate indeed seems to have been considerably behind many parts\r\nof the shire when he began his farming career.[500] When Coke came\r\ninto his estate, in five leases which were about to expire the farms\r\nwere held at 3s. 6d. an acre; and in the previous leases they had been\r\n1s. 6d. an acre. We may judge of the quality of this land by comparing\r\nit with the average rent of 10s. which Young says prevailed at this\r\ntime. With a view to remedy this state of things he studied the\r\nagriculture of other counties, and his observations thereon reveal a\r\nvery poor kind of farming in many places: in Cheshire the rich pasture\r\nwas wasted and the poor impoverished by sheer ignorance, in Yorkshire\r\nluxuriant grass was understocked, in Shropshire there were hardly any\r\nsheep; in his own part of Norfolk the usual rotation was three white\r\nstraw crops and then broadcast turnips.[501] This Coke changed to two\r\nwhite crops and two years pasture, and he dug up and brought to the\r\nsurface the rich marl which lay under the flint and sand, so that\r\nclover and grasses began to grow. So successful was he in this that in\r\n1796 he cut nearly 400 tons of sainfoin from 104 acres of land\r\npreviously valued at 12s. an acre. He increased his flock of sheep\r\nfrom 800 worthless animals with backs as narrow as rabbits, the\r\ndescription of the Norfolk sheep of the day, to 2,500 good Southdowns.\r\nEncouraged by the Duke of Bedford, another great agriculturist, he\r\nstarted a herd of North Devons, and, fattening two Devons against one\r\nShorthorn, found the former weighed 140 stone, the latter 110, and the\r\nShorthorn had eaten more food than the two Devons. However, a single\r\nexperiment of this kind is not very conclusive.\r\n\r\nThe ploughs of Norfolk were, as in many other counties, absurdly\r\nover-horsed, from three to five being used when only two were\r\nnecessary; so Coke set the example of using two whenever possible, and\r\nwon a bet with Sir John Sebright by ploughing an acre of stiff land in\r\nHertfordshire in a day with a pair of horses. He transformed the bleak\r\nbare countryside by planting 50 acres of trees every year until he had\r\n3,000 acres well covered, and in 1832 had probably the unique\r\nexperience of embarking in a ship which was built of oak grown from\r\nthe acorns he had himself planted.[502] Between 1776 and 1842 (the\r\ndate of his death) he is said to have spent £536,992 on improving his\r\nestate, without reckoning the large sums spent on his house and\r\ndemesne, the home farm, and his marsh farm of 459 acres. This\r\nexpenditure paid in the long run, but when he entered upon it, it must\r\nhave seemed very doubtful if this would be the case. A good\r\nunderstanding between landlord and tenant was the basis of his policy,\r\nand to further this he let his farms on long leases, at moderate\r\nrents, with few restrictions. When farmers improved their holdings on\r\nhis estate the rent was not raised on them, so that the estate\r\nbenefited greatly, and good tenants were often rewarded by having\r\nexcellent houses built for them; so good, indeed, that his political\r\nopponents the Tories, whom he, as a staunch Whig detested, made it one\r\nof their complaints against him that he built palaces for farmhouses.\r\nAt first he met with that stolid opposition to progress which seems\r\nthe particular characteristic of the farmer. For sixteen years no one\r\nfollowed him in the use of the drill, though it was no new thing; and\r\nwhen it was adopted he reckoned its use spread at the rate of a mile a\r\nyear. Yet eventually he had his reward; his estate came to command the\r\npick of English tenant farmers, who never left it except through old\r\nage, and would never live under any other landlord. Even the Radical\r\nCobbett, to whom, as to most of his party, landlords were, and are,\r\nthe objects of inveterate hatred, said that every one who knew him\r\nspoke of him with affection. Coke was the first to distinguish between\r\nthe adaptability of the different kinds of grass seeds to different\r\nsoils, and thereby made the hitherto barren lands of his estate better\r\npasture land than that of many rich counties. Carelessness about the\r\nquality of grasses sown was universal for a long time. The farmer took\r\nhis seeds from his own foul hayrick, or sent to his neighbour for a\r\nsupply of rubbish; even Bakewell derived his stock from his hayloft.\r\nIt was not until the Society for the Encouragement of Arts offered\r\nprizes for clean hay seeds that some improvement was noticeable. In\r\nNorfolk, as in other parts of England, there was at this time a strong\r\nprejudice against potatoes; the villagers of Holkham refused to have\r\nanything to do with them, but Coke's invincible persistency overcame\r\nthis unreasoning dislike and soon they refused to do without them.\r\n\r\nCoke was a great advocate for sowing wheat early and very thick in the\r\nrows, and for cutting it when ear and stem were green and the grain\r\nsoft, declaring that by so doing he got 2s. a quarter more for it; he\r\nalso believed in the early cutting of oats and peas. It was his custom\r\nto drill 4 bushels of wheat per acre, which he said prevented\r\ntillering and mildew. He was the first to grow swedes on a large\r\nscale.[503] The famous Holkham Sheep-shearings, known locally as\r\n'Coke's Clippings', which began in 1778 and lasted till 1821, arose\r\nfrom his practice of gathering farmers together for consultation on\r\nmatters agricultural, and developed into world-famous meetings\r\nattended by all nationalities and all ranks, men journeying from\r\nAmerica especially to attend them, and Lafayette expressed it as one\r\nof his great regrets that he had never attended one. At these\r\ngatherings all were equal, the suggestion of the smallest tenant\r\nfarmer was listened to with respect, and the same courtesy and\r\nhospitality were shown to all whether prince or farmer. At the last\r\nmeeting in 1821 no less than 7,000 people were present. His skill,\r\nenergy, and perseverance worked a revolution in the crops; his own\r\nwheat crops were from 10 to 12 coombs an acre, his barley sometimes\r\nnearly 20. The annual income of timber and underwood was £2,700, and\r\nfrom 1776 to 1816 he increased the rent roll of his estate from £2,200\r\nto £20,000, which, even after allowing for the great advance in prices\r\nduring that period, is a wonderful rise. It is a very significant fact\r\nthat there was not an alehouse on the estate, and in connexion with\r\nthis, and with the fact that his improvements made a constant demand\r\nfor labour, we are not surprised to learn that the workhouse was\r\npulled down as useless, for it was always empty, and this at a time\r\nwhen the working-classes of England were pauperized to an alarming\r\ndegree. The year 1818 was one of terrible distress all over England in\r\ncountry and town, yet at his sheep-shearing of that year Coke was\r\nenabled to say he had trebled the population of his estate and not a\r\nsingle person was out of employment, though everywhere else farmers\r\nwere turning off hands and cutting down wages. Principally through his\r\nagency, between 1804 and 1821, no less than 153 enclosures took place\r\nin Norfolk, while between 1790 and 1810, 2,000,000 acres of waste land\r\nin England were brought under cultivation largely by his efforts. He\r\nis said, indeed, to have transformed agriculture throughout England,\r\nand, but for that, the country would not have been able to grow enough\r\nfood for its support during the war with Napoleon, and must have\r\nsuccumbed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[440] _Northern Tour_, i. 9.

It was a\r\nprosperity, however, that was largely fictitious, and when the high\r\nprices of the war time were over, it was succeeded by many disastrous\r\nyears. The prosperity, too, was also largely neutralized by a crushing\r\nweight of taxation and rates, while the labourer, although his wages\r\nwere increased, found prices grow at a much greater rate, and it was,\r\nas Thorold Rogers has said, the most miserable period in his history.\r\n\r\nIts commencement was marked by the foundation of the Board of\r\nAgriculture. On May 15, 1793, Sir John Sinclair[504] moved in the\r\nHouse of Commons, 'that His Majesty would take into his consideration\r\nthe advantages which might be derived from the establishment of such a\r\nboard, for though in some particular districts improved methods of\r\ncultivating the soil were practised, yet in the greatest part of these\r\nkingdoms the principles of agriculture are not sufficiently\r\nunderstood, nor are the implements of husbandry or the stock of the\r\nfarmer brought to that perfection of which they are capable. His\r\nMajesty's faithful Commons were persuaded that if it were founded a\r\nspirit of improvement might be encouraged, which would result in\r\nimportant national benefits.\r\n\r\nThe motion was carried by 101 to 26. By its charter the board\r\nconsisted of a president, 16 ex-officio and 30 ordinary members, with\r\nhonorary and corresponding members. It was not a Government department\r\nin the modern sense of the term, but a society for the encouragement\r\nof agriculture, as the Royal Society is for the encouragement of\r\nscience. It was, indeed, supported by parliamentary grants, receiving\r\na sum of £3,000 a year, but the Government had only a limited control\r\nover its affairs through the ex-officio members, among whom were the\r\nArchbishops of Canterbury and York, the Lord Chancellor, the First\r\nLord of the Admiralty, and the Speaker.\r\n\r\nThe first president was Sir John Sinclair, and the first secretary\r\nArthur Young, with a salary of £400 a year, which he thought\r\ninsufficient.[505] The first task of the new board was that of\r\npreparing statistical accounts of English agriculture, and it was\r\nintended to take in hand the commutation of tithes, which would have\r\nbeen a great boon to farmers, with whom the prevailing system of\r\ncollecting tithes was very unpopular; but the Primate's opposition\r\nstopped this. The board appointed lecturers, procured a reward for\r\nElkington for his draining system, encouraged Macadam in his plans for\r\nimproving roads, and Meikle the inventor of the thrashing machine, and\r\nobtained the removal of taxes on draining tiles, and other taxes\r\ninjurious to agriculture. It also recommended the allotment system,\r\nand Sinclair desired 3 acres and a cow for every industrious cottager.\r\nDuring the abnormally high prices of provisions from 1794-6, the\r\nquartern loaf in London in 1795 being 1s. 6d., though next year it\r\ndropped to 7-3/4d.,[506] the board made experiments in making bread\r\nwith substitutes for wheat, which resulted in a public exhibition of\r\neighty different sorts of bread. Its efforts were generally followed\r\nby increased zeal among agriculturists; but Sinclair, an able but\r\nimpetuous man,[507] appears to have taken things too much into his own\r\nhands and pushed them too speedily.\r\n\r\nFinancial difficulties came, chiefly owing to the cost of the surveys,\r\nwhich had been hurried on with undue haste and often with great\r\ncarelessness, the surveyors sometimes being men who knew nothing of\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nSinclair was deposed from the presidency in 1798, and succeeded by\r\nLord Somerville. He again was succeeded by Lord Carrington, under\r\nwhose presidency the board offered premiums (the first of £200), owing\r\nto the high price of wheat and consequent distress, for essays on the\r\nbest means of converting certain portions of grass land into tillage\r\nwithout exhausting the soil, and of returning the same to grass, after\r\na certain period, in an improved state, or at least without injury.\r\nThe general report, based on the information derived from these\r\nessays, states that no high price of corn or temporary distress would\r\njustify the ploughing up of old meadows or rich pastures, and that on\r\ncertain soils well adapted to grass age improves the quality of the\r\npasture to a degree which no system of management on lands broken up\r\nand laid down can equal. In spite of this, the cupidity of landowners\r\nand farmers, when wheat was a guinea a bushel or at prices near it,\r\nled to the ploughing up of much splendid grass land, which was never\r\nlaid down again until, perhaps in recent years, owing to the low price\r\nof grain; so that some of the land at all events has, owing to bad\r\ntimes, returned to the state best suited to it.\r\n\r\nThe board looked upon the enclosure and cultivation of waste lands,\r\nwhich in England they estimated at 6,000,000 acres,[508] as a panacea\r\nfor the prevailing distress, and after much opposition they managed to\r\npass through both Houses in 1801 a Bill cheapening and facilitating\r\nthe process of parliamentary enclosure. This Act, 41 Geo. III, c. 109,\r\n'extracted a number of clauses from various private Acts and enacted\r\nthat they should hold good in all cases where the special Act did not\r\nexpressly provide to the contrary.' Another benefit rendered to\r\nagriculture was the establishment in 1803 of lectures on agricultural\r\nchemistry, the first lecturer engaged being Mr., afterwards Sir\r\nHumphry, Davy, who may be regarded as the father of agricultural\r\nchemistry.\r\n\r\nIn 1806 Sinclair was re-elected president, and his second term was\r\nmainly devoted to completing the agricultural surveys of the different\r\ncounties, which, before his retirement in 1813, he had with one or two\r\nexceptions the satisfaction of seeing finished. Though over-impetuous,\r\nhe rendered valuable service to agriculture, not only by his own\r\nenergy but by stirring up energy in others; as William Wilberforce the\r\nphilanthrophist said, 'I have myself seen collected in that small room\r\nseveral of the noblemen and gentlemen of the greatest properties in\r\nthe British Isles, all of them catching and cultivating an\r\nagricultural spirit, and going forth to spend in the employment of\r\nlabourers, and I hope in the improvement of land, immense sums which\r\nmight otherwise have been lavished on hounds and horses, or squandered\r\non theatricals.'\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous subjects into which the board inquired was the\r\ndivining rod for finding water, which was tested in Hyde Park in 1801,\r\nand successfully stood the test. In 1805, Davy the chemist reported on\r\na substance in South America called 'guana', which he had analysed and\r\nfound to contain one-third of ammoniacal salt with other salts and\r\ncarbon, but its use was not to come for another generation. From the\r\ntime of Sinclair's retirement in 1813 the board declined. Arthur\r\nYoung, its secretary, had become blind and his capacity therefore\r\nimpaired. One year its lack of energy was shown by the return of\r\n£2,000 of the Government grant to the Treasury because it had nothing\r\nto spend it on. The Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, was against it,\r\nthe clergy feared the commutation of tithe which the board advocated,\r\nthe legal profession was against the Enclosure Act, the landed\r\ninterest thought the surveys were intended for purposes of taxation;\r\nand the grant being withdrawn, an effort to maintain the board by\r\nvoluntary subscription failed, so that it dissolved in 1822, after\r\ndoing much valuable work for English agriculture.\r\n\r\nBefore its extinction it had held in 1821, at Aldridge's Repository,\r\nthe first national agricultural show. £685 was given in prizes, and\r\nthe entries included 10 bulls, 9 cows and heifers, several fat steers\r\nand cows, 7 pens of Leicester and Cotswold rams and ewes; 12 pens of\r\nDown, and 9 or 10 pens of Merino rams and ewes.[509] Most of the\r\ncattle shown were Shorthorn, or Durham, as they were then called, with\r\nsome Herefords, Devons, Longhorns, and Alderneys. There were also\r\nexhibits of grass, turnip-seed, roots, and implements.\r\n\r\nThis first national show had been preceded by many local ones.[510]\r\nThe end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth centuries\r\nsaw the establishment all over England of farmers' clubs, cattle\r\nshows, and ploughing matches.\r\n\r\nThe period now before us is marked by the great work of the Collings,\r\nwho next to Bakewell did most to improve the cattle of the United\r\nKingdom. Charles Colling was born in 1751, and the scene of his famous\r\nlabours was Ketton near Darlington. He had learnt from Bakewell the\r\nall-importance of quality in cattle, and determined to improve the\r\nlocal Shorthorn breed near his own home, which had been described in\r\n1744 as 'the most profitable beasts for the dairyman, butcher, and\r\ngrazier, with their wide bags, short horns, and large bodies.' He was\r\nto make these 'profitable beasts' the best all-round cattle in the\r\nworld, and to succeed where George Culley had failed. The first bull\r\nof merit he possessed was 'Hubback',[511] described as a little\r\nyellow, red, and white five-year-old, which was mated with cows\r\nafterwards to be famous, named Duchess, Daisy, Cherry, and Lady\r\nMaynard. At first Colling was against in-breeding, and not until 1793\r\ndid he adopt it, more by accident than intention, but the experiment\r\nbeing successful he became an enthusiast. The experiment was the\r\nputting of Phoenix to Lord Bolingbroke, who was both her half-brother\r\nand her nephew, and the result was the famous Favourite. A young\r\nfarmer who saw Favourite and his sister at Darlington in 1799, was so\r\nstruck by them that he paid Colling the first 100 guineas ever given\r\nfor a Shorthorn cow.[512]\r\n\r\nOne of Hubback's daughters had in 1795, by Favourite, a roan calf\r\nwhich grew to be the celebrated Durham Ox, which at five and a half\r\nyears weighed 3,024 lb., and was sold for £140. It was sold again for\r\n£250, the second purchaser refusing £2,000 for it, and taking it round\r\nEngland on show made a profitable business out of it, in one day in\r\nLondon making £97. A still more famous animal was the bull Comet, born\r\n1804, which at the great sale in 1810 fetched 1,000 guineas. This bull\r\nwas the crowning triumph of Colling's career and the result of very\r\nclose breeding, being described as the best bull ever seen, with a\r\nfine masculine head, broad and deep chest, shoulders well laid back,\r\nloins good, hind-quarters long, straight and well packed, thighs\r\nthick, with nice straight hocks and hind legs. Perhaps Colling thought\r\nhe had pursued in-and-in breeding too far, at all events in 1810 he\r\ndispersed his famous herd. The sale was held at a most propitious\r\ntime, for the Durham Ox had advertised the name of Colling far and\r\nwide, and owing to the war prices were very high. Comet fetched 1,000\r\nguineas, and the other forty-seven lots averaged £151 8s. 5d., an\r\nunheard-of sale, yet all the auctioneer got was 5 guineas, much of the\r\nwork of the sale falling on the owner, and the former sold the stock\r\nwith a sand-glass.\r\n\r\nAfter the sale at Ketton, Brampton, the farm of Charles's brother\r\nRobert, became the centre of interest to the Shorthorn world. Robert\r\nobtained excellent prices for his stock, five daughters of his famous\r\nbull George fetching 200 guineas each. Probably he, like his brother,\r\npursued in-and-in breeding too far, and in 1818 there was another\r\ngreat sale; but war-prices had gone and agriculture was depressed, so\r\nthat the cattle fetched less than at Ketton, but still averaged £128\r\n14s. 9d. for 61 lots, and 22 rams averaged £39 6s. 4d. Robert died in\r\n1820, his brother in 1836.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that the Collings were the founders of a new breed\r\nof cattle; they were the collectors and preservers of an ancient breed\r\nthat might otherwise have disappeared.[513] The object of good\r\nbreeders was now to get their cattle fat at an early age, and they so\r\nfar succeeded as to sell three-year-old steers for £20 apiece,\r\ngenerally fed thus: in the first winter, hay and turnips; the\r\nfollowing summer, coarse pasture; the second winter, straw in the\r\nfoldyard and a few turnips; next summer, tolerable good pasture; and\r\nthe third winter, as many turnips as they could eat.[514]\r\n\r\nCattle at this time were classified thus: Shorthorns, Devons, Sussex,\r\nHerefords (the two latter said by Culley to be varieties of the\r\nDevon), Longhorned, Galloway or Polled, Suffolk Duns, Kyloes, and\r\nAlderneys.\r\n\r\nSheep thus: the Dishley Breed (New Leicesters), Lincolns, Teeswaters,\r\nDevonshire Notts, Exmoor, Dorsetshire, Herefordshire, Southdown,\r\nNorfolk, Heath, Herdwick, Cheviot, Dunfaced, Shetland, Irish.[515]\r\n\r\nWith the increased demand for corn and meat from the towns the\r\nnecessity of new and better implements became apparent, and many\r\npatents were taken out: by Praed, for drill ploughs, in 1781; by\r\nHorn, for sowing machines, in 1784; by Heaton, for harrows, in 1787;\r\nfor sowing machines, by Sandilands, 1788; for reaping machines, by\r\nBoyce, 1799; winnowing machines, by Cooch, 1800; haymakers, by Salmon,\r\n1816; and for scarifiers, chaff-cutters, turnip-slicers, and\r\nfood-crushers.[516] But the great innovation was the threshing machine\r\nof Meikle. Like most inventions, it had forerunners. The first\r\nthreshing machine is mentioned in the _Select Transactions of the\r\nSociety of Improvers in the Knowledge of Agriculture in Scotland_,\r\npublished in 1743 by Maxwell. It was invented by Michael Menzies, and\r\nby it one man could do the work of six. One machine was worked by a\r\ngreat water-wheel and triddles, another by a little wheel of 3 feet\r\ndiameter, moved by a small quantity of water. The first attempts to\r\nsubstitute horse or other power for manual in threshing were directed\r\nto the revolution of jointed flails, which should strike the floor on\r\nwhich the corn was spread, but this proved unsatisfactory, so that\r\nrubbing the grain out of the straw by revolving cylinders was\r\ntried,[517] Young, in his northern tour, met a Mr. Clarke at Belford\r\nin Northumberland, who was famous for mechanics,[518] among his\r\ninventions being a threshing machine worked by one horse, which does\r\nnot seem to have effected much. Eventually Mr. A. Meikle, of Houston\r\nMill near Haddington, in 1798 erected a machine the principles of\r\nwhich, much modified, are those of to-day; and in 1803 Mr. Aitchison,\r\nof Drumore in East Lothian, first applied steam to threshing. It was\r\nsome time, however, before this beneficent invention was generally\r\nused, and when the machines were used they were usually driven by\r\nhorse--or water-power until about 1850. In 1883 Messrs. Howard, of\r\nBedford, adapted a sheaf-binding apparatus to the threshing machine.\r\nWith new implements came new crops; the Swede turnip was grown on some\r\nfarms in Notts just before 1800, but it is not known who introduced\r\nit.[519] The mangel wurzel was introduced about 1780-5 by Parkyns, and\r\nprickly comfrey in 1811.\r\n\r\nThe year 1795 was one of great scarcity owing to the wet and stormy\r\nsummer, and in August wheat went up to 108s. a quarter.[520] As usual\r\nmany other causes but the right one were put forth, and the old\r\naccusations of monopoly, forestalling, and regrating were heard again.\r\nThe war with France, with more reason, was considered to have helped\r\nin raising prices, but the chief cause was the bad season. The members\r\nof both Houses of Parliament bound themselves to reduce the\r\nconsumption of bread in their homes by one-third, and recommended\r\nothers to a similar reduction. It was a period of terrible distress\r\nfor the agricultural labourer. His wages were about 9s. a week, and it\r\nwas impossible for him to live on them, so that what is known as 'the\r\nallowance system' came in. At Speenhamland in Berkshire, in this year,\r\nthe magistrates agreed that it was not expedient to help the labourer\r\nby regulating his wages according to the statute of Elizabeth, but\r\nrecommended the farmers to increase their pay in proportion to the\r\npresent price of provisions, and they also granted relief to all poor\r\nand industrious men according to the price of bread. They were merely\r\ngiving effect to Gilbert's Act of 1782, which legalized the\r\nsupplementing of the wages of able-bodied men from the rates, and the\r\ndecision was nicknamed the 'Speenhamland Act' because it was so\r\ngenerally followed. However well meant, the effect was most\r\ndemoralizing and the English labourer, already too prone to look to\r\nthe State for help, was induced to depend less on his own exertions.\r\nThe real remedy would have been a substantial increase of his scanty\r\nwages. As it was, landowner and farmer were often paying the labourer\r\nin rates money that would far better have come to him in wages, and\r\nthe rates in some districts became so burdensome that land was thrown\r\nout of cultivation. In the same year as the Speenhamland Act the\r\nstatute 36 Geo. III, c. 23, forbade the removal of persons from any\r\nparish until they were in actual need of support; but although the law\r\nwas thus relaxed, the fixed principle which caused the refusal of all\r\npermanent relief to labourers who had no settlement in the parish\r\nacted as a very efficient check on migration, though, as we have seen,\r\nit did not entirely check it. In 1796 the question of regulating the\r\nlabourers' wages by Parliament was raised; but Pitt, remembering such\r\nschemes had always failed, was hostile, and the matter dropped.[521]\r\nIn the same year Eden made his inquiries concerning the rate of wages\r\nand the cost of living. In Bedford, he found the agricultural labourer\r\nwas getting 1s. 2d. a day and beer, with extras in harvest[522]; but\r\nbacon was 10d. a lb. and wheat 12s. a bushel. However, parish\r\nallowances were liberal, a man, his wife, and four children sometimes\r\nreceiving 11s. a week from that source.\r\n\r\nIn Cumberland the labourer was being paid 10d. to 1s. a day with food,\r\nor 1s. 6d. to 1s. 8d. without; in Hertfordshire, 1s. 6d. a day; in\r\nSuffolk, 1s. 4d. a day and beer.\r\n\r\nNearly everywhere his expenditure was much in excess of his earnings,\r\nthe yearly budgets of fifty-three families in twelve different\r\ncounties showed generally large annual deficiencies, amounting in one\r\ncase to £21 18s. 4d. In one case in Lindsey, where the deficiency was\r\nsmall, the family lived on bread alone. The factory system, too, had\r\nalready deprived the labourer of many of his by-industries, and thus\r\nhelped the pauperism for which landlord and farmer had to pay in\r\nrates.\r\n\r\nAbout 1788 Sir William Young proposed to send the unemployed labourers\r\nround to the parishioners to get work, their wages being paid by their\r\nemployers and by the parish. This method of obtaining work was known\r\nas the 'roundsman system'.[523]\r\n\r\nLandlords, however, and farmers were profiting greatly by the high\r\nprices, which fortunately received a check by the abundant harvest of\r\n1796, which, with large imports,[524] caused the price of wheat to\r\nfall to 57s. 3d., and in 1798 to 47s. 10d. It is difficult to conceive\r\nwhat instability, speculation, and disaster such fluctuations must\r\nhave led to. In 1797 the Bank Restriction Act was passed, suspending\r\ncash payments, and thereby causing a huge growth in credit\r\ntransactions, a great factor in the inflated prosperity of this\r\nperiod. In January, 1799, wool was 2s. a lb., and prices at\r\nSmithfield:\r\n\r\n                              s. d.        s. d.\r\n\r\n  Beef, per stone of 8 lb.    3  0    to   3  4\r\n  Mutton      \"        \"      3  0     \"   4  2\r\n  Pork        \"        \"      2  8     \"   3  8\r\n\r\nThe summer of that year was uninterruptedly wet; some corn in the\r\nnorth was uncut in November, so that wheat went up to 94s. 2d., and in\r\nJune, 1800, was 134s. 5d., the scarcity being aggravated by the\r\nRussian Government laying an embargo on British shipping.[525] Yet\r\nPitt denied that the high prices were due to the war.[526] They were\r\ndue, indeed, to several causes:\r\n\r\n  1. Frequent years of scarcity.\r\n\r\n  2. Increase of consumption, owing to the great growth of\r\n     the manufacturing population, England during the war having\r\n     almost a monopoly of the trade of Europe.\r\n\r\n  3. Napoleon's obstructions to importation.\r\n\r\n  4. The unprecedented fall of foreign exchanges.\r\n\r\n  5. The rise in the price of labour, scanty as it was.\r\n\r\n  6. Suspension of cash payments, which produced a medium\r\n     of circulation of an unlimited nature, and led to speculation.[527]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1801, wheat was 156s.; beef at Smithfield, 5s. to 6s. 6d. a\r\nstone; and mutton, 6s. 6d. to 8s. A rise in wages was allowed on all\r\nsides to be imperative, but the labourer even now got on an average\r\nlittle more than 9s. a week,[528] a very inadequate pittance, though\r\ngenerally supplemented by the parish. Arthur Young[529] tells of a\r\nperson living near Bury in 1801, who, before the era of high prices,\r\nearned 5s. a week, and with that could purchase:\r\n\r\n  A bushel of wheat.\r\n        \"      malt.\r\n  1 lb. of butter.\r\n  1 lb. of cheese.\r\n  A pennyworth of tobacco.\r\n\r\nBut in 1801 the same articles cost him:\r\n\r\n                             s. d.\r\n\r\n  A bushel of wheat         16  0\r\n       \"      malt           9  0\r\n  1 lb. of butter            1  0\r\n  1 lb. of cheese               4\r\n  Tobacco                       1\r\n                         --------\r\n                         £1  6  5\r\n                         ========\r\n\r\nHis wages were now 9s., and his allowance from the rates 6s., so that\r\nthere was a deficiency of 11s. 5d.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the cost of living in the last thirty years is\r\nfurther illustrated by the following table:\r\n\r\n                        1773.       1793.       1799.       1800.\r\n                       £  s. d.    £  s. d.    £  s. d.    £  s. d.\r\n\r\n  Coomb of malt          12  0     1  3  0     1  3  0     2  0  0\r\n  Chaldron of coals    1 11  6     2  0  6     2  6  0     2 11  0\r\n  Coomb of oats           5  0       13  0       16  0     1  1  0\r\n  Load of hay          2  2  0     4 10  0     5  5  0     7  0  0\r\n  Meat, per lb.              4           5           7           9\r\n  Butter,  \"                 6          11          11        1  4\r\n  Loaf sugar, per lb.        8        1  0        1  3        1  4\r\n  Poor rates, in the £    1  0        2  6        3  0        5  0\r\n\r\nIt was again proposed by Mr. Whitbread in the House of Commons that\r\nwages should be regulated by the price of provisions, and a minimum\r\nwage fixed; but there was enough sense in the House to reject this\r\nreturn to obsolete methods.\r\n\r\nAfter March, 1801, prices commenced to fall, owing to a favourable\r\nseason and the reopening of the Baltic ports, which allowed imports to\r\ncome in more freely, for most of our foreign corn at this time came\r\nfrom Germany and Denmark. At the end of the year wheat averaged 75s.\r\n6d., and with fair seasons it came down in the beginning of 1804 to\r\n49s. 6d. Beef at Smithfield was from 4s. to 5s. 4d. a stone, mutton\r\nfrom 4s. to 4s. 6d.[530] This great drop in prices was accompanied by\r\nan increase in wages, the labourer from 1804 to 1810 getting on an\r\naverage 12s. a week[531]; the cost of implements rose, so did the rate\r\nof interest, and the cry of agricultural distress in 1804 was heard\r\neverywhere. More protection was demanded by those interested in the\r\nland, and accordingly a duty of 24s. 3d. was imposed when the price\r\nwas 63s. or under; a bounty was paid on export when it was 40s. or\r\nunder; and wheat might be exported without bounty up to 54s.\r\n\r\nHowever, 1804 was a very deficient harvest, owing to blight and\r\nmildew, and by the end of the year wheat was 86s. 2d. The harvests\r\ntill 1808 were not as bad as that of 1804, but not good enough to\r\nlower the prices. Also, owing to the Berlin and Milan Decrees of\r\nNapoleon and the Non-intercourse Act of the United States of America,\r\nimports were restricted so that at the end of 1808 wheat was 92s. In\r\nthis year the exports of wheat exceeded the imports, but it was due to\r\nthe requirements of our army in Spain; and 1789 was the last year when\r\nexports were greater under normal circumstances.[532] 1809 was a bad\r\nharvest, so was 1810; in the former rot being very prevalent among\r\nsheep; and by August, 1810, hay was £11 a load and wheat 116s., only\r\nlarge imports (1,567,126 quarters) preventing a famine. Down wool was\r\n2s. 1d. per lb., beef and mutton 8-1/2d., cheese 8d.[533]\r\n\r\nIn 1811 the whole of July and part of August were wet and cold; and\r\nin August, 1812, wheat averaged 155s., the finest Dantzic selling at\r\nMark Lane for 180s., and oats reached 84s. As our imports of corn then\r\nchiefly came from the north-west of Europe, which has a climate very\r\nsimilar to our own, crops there were often deficient from bad seasons\r\nin the same years as our own, and the price consequently high. On the\r\nother hand, it is a proof that produce will find the best market\r\nregardless of hindrances, that much of our corn at this time came from\r\nFrance. Corn in 1813 was seized on with such avidity that there was no\r\nneed to show samples. As high prices had now prevailed for some time\r\nand were still rising, landlords and farmers jumped to the conclusion\r\nthat they would be permanent; so that this is the period when rents\r\nexperienced their greatest increase, in some cases having increased\r\nfivefold since 1790, and speculations in land were most general. Land\r\nsold for forty years' purchase, many men of spirit and adventure very\r\ndifferent from farmers 'were tempted to risk their property in\r\nagricultural speculations',[534] and large sums were sunk in lands and\r\nimprovements in the spirit of mercantile enterprise. The land was\r\nconsidered as a kind of manufacturing establishment, and 'such powers\r\nof capital and labour were applied as forced almost sterility itself\r\nto become fertile.' Even good pastures were ploughed up to grow wheat\r\nat a guinea a bushel, and much worthless land was sown with corn.\r\nManure was procured from the most remote quarters, and we are told a\r\nnew science rose up, agricultural chemistry, which, 'with much\r\nfrivolity and many refinements remote from common sense, was not\r\nwithout great operation on the productive powers of land.'\r\n\r\nLand jobbing and speculation became general, and credit came to the\r\naid of capital. The larger farmers, as we have seen, were before the\r\nwar inclined to an extravagance that amazed their older\r\ncontemporaries; now we are told, some insisted on being called\r\nesquire, and some kept liveried servants.[535]\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat curious to learn that one of the drawbacks from which\r\nfarmers suffered at this time was the ravages of pigeons, which seem\r\nto have been as numerous as in the Middle Ages, when the lord's\r\ndovecote was the scourge of the villein's crops. In 1813 there was\r\nsaid to be 20,000 pigeon houses in England and Wales, each on an\r\naverage containing 100 pairs of old pigeons.[536]\r\n\r\nAnother pest was the large number of 'vermin', whose destruction had\r\nlong before been considered important enough to demand the attention\r\nof the legislature.[537] Some parishes devoted large portions of their\r\nfunds to this object; in 1786 East Budleigh in Devonshire, out of a\r\ntotal receipt of £20 1s. 8-1/2d., voted £5 10s. for vermin killing.\r\nThat now sacred animal the fox was then treated with scant respect,\r\nfarmers and landlords paying for his destruction as 'vermin'[538]; the\r\nparish accounts of Ashburton in Devonshire, for instance, from\r\n1761-1820 include payments for killing 18 foxes and 4 vixens, with no\r\nless than 153 badgers.\r\n\r\nBut the edifice of artificial prosperity was already tottering. After\r\n1812 prices fell steadily,[539] the abundant harvest of 1813 and the\r\nopening of the continental ports accelerated this, and by December,\r\n1813, wheat was 73s. 3d. Yet agriculture had made solid progress. The\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons which inquired into the state of the\r\ncorn trade in 1813 stated that through the extension of, and\r\nimprovements in, agriculture the agricultural produce of the kingdom\r\nhad increased one-fourth in the preceding ten years.[540] The high\r\nprices had attracted a large amount of capital to the land, so that\r\nthere was very rapid and extensive progress, the methods of tillage\r\nwere improved, large tracts of inferior pasture converted into arable,\r\nmuch, however, of which was soon to revert to weeds; there were many\r\nenclosures, and many fens, commons, and wastes reclaimed. But there\r\nwas a reverse side to this picture of prosperity, even in the case of\r\nlandlord and farmer. The burden of taxation was crushing; a\r\ncontemporary writer, a farmer of twenty-five years standing,[541]\r\nwrote that, with the land tax remaining the same, there was a high\r\nproperty tax, house and window taxes were doubled, poor rates in some\r\nplaces trebled, highway, church, and constable rates doubled and\r\ntrebled, and there were oppressive taxes on malt and horses, both nags\r\nand farm animals. A man renting a farm at £70 and keeping two\r\nfarm-horses, a nag, and a dog, would pay taxes for them of £5 0s. 6d.,\r\na fourteenth of his rent.[542] Indeed, poor rates of 16s. and 20s. in\r\nthe £ were known,[543] and they were occasionally more than the whole\r\nrent received by the landlord forty years before. A Devonshire\r\nlandowner complained that seven-sixteenths out of the annual value of\r\nevery estate in the county was taken from owners and occupiers in\r\ndirect taxes.[544] And the Committee on Agricultural Depression of\r\n1822 asserted that during the war taxes and rates were quadrupled.[545]\r\nBlacksmiths, whitesmiths, collar makers, ropers, carpenters, and many\r\nother tradesmen with whom the farmer dealt, raised their prices\r\nthreefold; and it was openly asserted that the high prices of grain\r\nand stock were not proportionate to the increase of other prices. Much\r\nof the grass land broken up in the earlier years of the war was before\r\nthe close in a miserable condition, for it was cropped year after year\r\nwithout manure, and was worn out. On the whole it may be doubted if\r\nthe bulk of the farmers of England made large profits during the war;\r\nmany no doubt profited by the extraordinary fluctuations in prices,\r\nand it was those men who 'kept liveried servants'; but there must have\r\nbeen many who lost heavily by the same means, and the rise of rent,\r\ntaxes, rates, labour, and tradesmen's prices largely discounted the\r\nprices of corn and stock. The landowners at this period have generally\r\nbeen described as flourishing at the expense of the community, but\r\ntheir increased rents were greatly neutralized by the weight of\r\ntaxation and the general rise in prices. A contemporary writer says\r\nthat owing to the heavy taxes, even in the war time, he 'often had not\r\na shilling at the end of the year.'[546]\r\n\r\nThe following accounts, drawn up in 1805,[547] do not show that\r\nfarmers were making much money with wheat at 10s. a bushel:\r\n\r\nAccount of the culture of an acre of wheat on good fallow land:\r\n\r\n       Dr.                       £  s. d.\r\n\r\n  Two years' rent                2  0  0\r\n  Hauling dung from fold           10  0\r\n  Four ploughings                2  0  0\r\n  Two harrowings                    4  0\r\n  Lime                           1 18  0\r\n  Seed, 2-1/2 bushels            1  5  0\r\n  Reaping                           5  0\r\n  Threshing                        10  0\r\n  Wages                             5  0\r\n  Tithes and taxes                 15  0\r\n                                --------\r\n                                £9 12  0\r\n                                ========\r\n\r\n             Cr.                 £  s. d.\r\n\r\n  20 bushels of wheat at 10s    10  0  0\r\n  The straw was set against\r\n  the value of the dung.\r\n  The tailend wheat was\r\n  Eaten by the family!\r\n                               ---------\r\n                               £10  0  0\r\n                               =========\r\n\r\nAnd on a farm on good land in the same county the following would be\r\nthe annual balance sheet at the same date:\r\n\r\n                      Dr.                           £   s. d.\r\n\r\n  Rent                                             200  0  0\r\n  Tithes                                            40  0  0\r\n  Wages                                             58  0  0\r\n  Extra harvestmen                                   7  0  0\r\n  Tradesmen's bills                                 50  0  0\r\n  Taxes and rates                                   58  0  0\r\n  Malt, hops, and cider                             60  0  0\r\n  Lime                                              20  0  0\r\n  Hop poles                                         10  0  0\r\n  Expenses at fairs and markets                      8  0  0\r\n  Clothing, groceries, &c., for the family          45  0  0\r\n  Interest on £1,500 capital, at 5 per cent.        75  0  0\r\n  Sundries                                          15  0  0\r\n                                                  ----------\r\n                                                  £646  0  0\r\n                                                  ==========\r\n\r\n                  Cr.                               £   s. d.\r\n\r\n  360 bushels of wheat, @ 10 s.                    180  0  0\r\n  300 bushels of barley, @ 6s.                      90  0  0\r\n  100 bushels of peas, @ 6s.                        30  0  0\r\n  20 cwt. hops                                      60  0  0\r\n  Sale of oxen, cows and calves                    150  0  0\r\n  Profits from sheep                               100  0  0\r\n     \"    from pigs, poultry, dairy, and sundries   50  0  0\r\n                                                  ----------\r\n                                                  £660  0  0\r\n                                                  ==========\r\n\r\nAccording to this the farmer did little more than pay rent, interest\r\non capital, and get a living. Yet prices of what he had to sell had\r\ngone up greatly: wheat in Herefordshire in 1760 was 3s. a bushel, in\r\n1805, 10s.; butcher's meat in 1760 was 1-1/2d. a lb., in 1804, 7d.;\r\nfresh butter 4-1/2d. in 1760, 1s. 3d. in 1804; a fat goose in Hereford\r\nmarket in 1740, 10d.; 1760, 1s.; 1804, 4s.; a couple of fowls in 1740,\r\n6d.; 1760, 7d.; 1804, 2s. 4d.[548] The winter of 1813-4 was\r\nextraordinarily severe, and the wheat crop was seriously injured, but\r\nthe increased breadth of cultivation, a large surplus, and great\r\nimportations kept the price down. Many sheep, however, were killed by\r\nthe hard winter, which also reduced the quality of the cattle, so that\r\nmeat was higher in 1814 than at any previous period.[549] At\r\nSmithfield beef was 6s. to 7s. a stone, mutton 7s. to 8s. 6d. With the\r\npeace of 1814 the fictitious prosperity came to an end, a large amount\r\nof paper was withdrawn from circulation, which lowered the price of\r\nall commodities, and a large number of country banks failed. The first\r\nsufferers were the agricultural classes, who happened at that time to\r\nhold larger supplies than usual, the value of which fell at once; the\r\nincomes of all were diminished, and the capital of many\r\nannihilated.[550] At the same time the demand for our manufactures\r\nfrom abroad fell off; the towns were impoverished, and bought less\r\nfrom the farmer.\r\n\r\nThe short period of war in 1815 had little effect on prices, and in\r\nJanuary, 1816, wheat was 52s. 6d., and the prices of live stock had\r\nfallen considerably. In 1815 protection reached its highest limit, the\r\nAct of that year prohibiting import of wheat when the price was under\r\n80s. a quarter, and other grain in proportion.[551] However, it was of\r\nno avail; and in the beginning of 1816 the complaints of agricultural\r\ndistress were so loud and deep that the Board of Agriculture issued\r\ncircular letters to every part of the kingdom, asking for information\r\non the state of agriculture.\r\n\r\nAccording to the answers given, rent had already fallen on an average\r\n25 per cent. and agriculture was in a 'deplorable state.'[552]\r\nBankruptcies, seizures, executions, imprisonments, were rife, many\r\nfarmers had become parish paupers. Rent was much in arrear, tithes and\r\npoor rates unpaid, improvements generally discontinued, live stock\r\ndiminished; alarming gangs of poachers and other depredators ranged\r\nthe country. The loss was greater on arable than on grass land, and\r\n'flock farms' had suffered less than others, though they had begun to\r\nfeel it heavily.\r\n\r\nAll classes connected with the land suffered severely; the landlords\r\ncould not get many of their rents; the farmer's stock had depreciated\r\n40 per cent.[553]; many labourers, who during the war had been getting\r\nfrom 15s. to 16s. a week and 18s. in summer,[554] were walking the\r\ncountry searching for employment. Many tenants threw up their farms,\r\nand it was often noticed that landlords, 'knowing very little of\r\nagriculture and taken by surprise,' could not manage the farms thrown\r\non their hands, and they went uncultivated. Some farmers paid up their\r\nrent to date, sold their stock, and went off without any notice;\r\nothers, less scrupulous, drove off their stock and moved their\r\nhousehold furniture in the night without settling.[555]\r\n\r\nFarmers and landowners were asked to state the remedies required. Some\r\nasked for more rent reduction and further prohibition of import, but\r\nthe most general cry was for the lessening of taxation.\r\n\r\nA Herefordshire farmer[556] stated that in 1815 the taxes on a farm of\r\n300 acres in that county were:\r\n\r\n                                                     £    s.  d.\r\n\r\n  Property tax, landlord and tenant                  95  16  10\r\n  Great tithes                                       64  17   6\r\n  Lesser tithes                                      29  15   0\r\n  Land tax                                           14   0   0\r\n  Window lights                                      24   1   6\r\n  Poor rates, landlord                               10   0   0\r\n       \"      tenant                                 40   0   0\r\n  Cart-horse duty, landlord, 3 horses                 2  11   0\r\n  Two saddle horses, landlord                         9   0   0\r\n  Gig                                                 6   6   0\r\n  Cart-horse duty,[557] tenant                        7   2   0\r\n  One saddle horse, tenant                            2  13   6\r\n  Landlord's malt duty on 60 bushels of barley       21   0   0\r\n  Tenant's duty for making 120 bushels of\r\n    barley into malt                                 42   0   0\r\n  New rate for building shire hall, paid by landlord  9   0   0\r\n          \"           \"           \"         tenant    3   0   0\r\n  Surcharge                                           2   8   0\r\n                                                   ------------\r\n                                                   £383  11   4\r\n                                                   ============\r\n\r\nThe parish of Kentchurch, in Herefordshire, paid in direct taxes a\r\ngreater sum than the lands of the whole parish could be let for.\r\n\r\nAnother very general complaint was of the collection of tithe in kind,\r\na most awkward and offensive method, causing great expense and waste,\r\nwhich, however, had given way in many places to compounding.\r\n\r\nSuch is the picture of agriculture after twenty years of high prices\r\nand protection.[558] One may naturally ask, if much money had been\r\nmade by farmers during these years, where had it all gone to that they\r\nwere reduced at the first breath of adversity to such straits? Some\r\nallowance must be made for the fact that these accounts come from\r\nthose interested in the land, who were always ready to make the most\r\nof misfortune with a view to further protection, and the farmer is a\r\nnotorious grumbler. It seems, however, that most landlords and tenants\r\nbelieved that the high prices would last for ever, and lived\r\naccordingly, and, as we have seen, many made no profit at all because\r\nof their increased burdens. As a matter of fact, both were grumbling\r\nbecause prices had come back to their natural level after an unnatural\r\ninflation.[559]\r\n\r\nHemp at this date was still grown in Lincolnshire and Somerset, and\r\nMarshall tells us that in 1803 there was a considerable quantity of\r\nhemp grown in Shropshire.[560] In that county there was a small plot\r\nof ground, called 'the hemp-yard,' appendant to almost every\r\nfarm-house and to many of the best sort of cottages. Whenever a\r\ncottager had 10 or 15 perches of land to his cottage, worth from 1s.\r\n6d. to 2s. 6d. a year, with the aid of his wife's industry it enabled\r\nhim to pay his rent. A peck of hempseed, costing 2s., sowed about 10\r\nperches of land, and this produced from 24 to 36 lb. of tow when\r\ndressed and fit for spinning. A dozen pounds of tow made 10 ells of\r\ncloth, worth generally about 3s. an ell. Thus a good crop on 10\r\nperches of land brought in £4 10s. 0d., half of which was nett profit.\r\nThe hemp was pulled a little before harvest, and immediately spread on\r\ngrass land, where it lay for a month or six weeks. The more rain there\r\nwas the sooner it was ready to take off the grass. When the rind\r\npeeled easily from the woody part, it was, on a dry day, taken into\r\nthe house, and when harvest was over well dried in fine weather and\r\ndressed, being then fit for the tow dresser, who prepared it for\r\nspinning. After the crop of hemp the land was sown with turnips, a\r\nvaluable resource for the winter.\r\n\r\nSince 1815 little hemp or flax has been grown in England[561]; in 1907\r\nthere were, according to the Agricultural Returns, 355 acres of flax\r\ngrown in England, and hemp was not mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[504] _R.A.S.E.

Those who lived in the\r\nfarm-house often fared best: in 1808 the diet of a Hampshire farm\r\nservant was, for breakfast, bacon, bread, and skim milk; for lunch,\r\nbread and cheese and small beer; for dinner, between 3 p.m. and 4\r\np.m., pickled pork or bacon with potatoes, cabbages, turnips, or\r\ngreens, and broths of wheat-flour and garden stuff. Supper consisted\r\nof bread and cheese and a pint of ale. His bread was usually made of\r\nwheat, which, considering the price, is remarkable. On Sundays he had\r\nfresh meat.

It was also because of the\r\nexpense[565] that many landlords desirous to enclose were unable to do\r\nso, and therefore devoted their attention to the improvement of the\r\ncommon fields. That agriculture benefited by enclosure there is no\r\npossible doubt, but it was attended with great hardships. The\r\nlandowner generally gained, for his rents increased largely. In\r\ntwenty-three parishes of Lincolnshire, for instance, his rents doubled\r\non enclosure. But the expenses were so heavy that his gain was often\r\nvery small, and sometimes he was a loser by the process. As for the\r\nfarmers, the poorer ones suffered, for more capital was needed for\r\nenclosed lands, and the process generally was so slow, taking from\r\ntwo to six years before the final award was given, that many farmers\r\nwere thrown out in the management of their farms, for they did not\r\nknow where their future lands would be allotted. That the poor\r\nsuffered greatly is indubitable: 'By nineteen Enclosure Acts out of\r\ntwenty the poor are injured, in some cases grossly injured,' wrote\r\nYoung in 1801.[566] In the Acts it was endeavoured to treat them\r\nfairly,[567] and allotments were made to them, or money paid on\r\nenclosure in lieu of their rights of common, or small plots of land;\r\nbut the expense of enclosing small allotments was proportionately very\r\ngreat, generally too great, and they had to be sold, while the sums of\r\nmoney were often spent in the alehouse. The results of sixty-eight\r\nActs were investigated in the eastern counties, with the result that\r\nin all but fifteen the poor were injured. It was generally found that\r\nthey had lost their cows.\r\n\r\nIts effect on the smallholder is well described by Davis in his\r\n_Report on Wilts_.[568] There, before enclosure, the tenants usually\r\noccupied yard-lands consisting of a homestead, 2 acres of meadow, 18\r\nacres of arable, generally in eighteen or twenty strips, with a right\r\non the common meadows, common fields and downs for 40 sheep, and as\r\nmany cattle as the tenant could winter with the fodder he grew. The 40\r\nsheep were kept by a common shepherd with the common herd, were taken\r\nevery day to the downs and brought back every night to be folded on\r\nthe arable fields, the rule being to fold 1,000 sheep on a 'tenantry'\r\nacre (three-quarters of a statute acre) every night.[569] In breeding\r\nsheep regard was had to 'folding quality,' i.e. the propensity to\r\ndrop manure only after being folded at night, as much as to quality\r\nand quantity of wool and meat. On enclosure the common flock was\r\nbroken up. The small farmer had no longer any common to turn his\r\nhorses on. The down on which he fed his sheep was largely curtailed,\r\nthe common shepherd was abolished, and the farmer had too few sheep to\r\nenable him individually to employ a shepherd. Therefore he had to part\r\nwith his flock. Having no cow common and very little pasture land he\r\ncould not keep cows. In such circumstances the small farmer, after a\r\nfew years, succumbed and became a labourer, or emigrated, or went to\r\nthe towns.\r\n\r\nIn a pamphlet called _The Case of Labourers in Husbandry_, 1795, the\r\nRev. David Davies said, 'by enclosure an amazing number of people have\r\nbeen reduced from a comfortable state of partial independence to the\r\nprecarious condition of mere hirelings, who when out of work\r\nimmediately come on the parish.' It has often been said that the poor\r\nwere robbed of their share in the land by the landowners; but as a\r\nmatter of fact it was the expense of securing the compensation allowed\r\nthem, much greater in proportion on small holdings than on large,\r\nwhich went into the pockets of surveyors and lawyers, that did this.\r\nIt was also often through the farmer that the labourer was deprived of\r\nhis land when he had retained an acre or two after enclosure. Wishing\r\nto make the labourer dependent on him, he persuaded the agent to let\r\nthe cottages with the farm, and the agent in order to avoid collecting\r\na number of small rents consented. As soon as the farmer had the\r\ncottages he took the land from them and added it to his own. The\r\npeasant's losses engaged the serious attention of many landlords; near\r\nTewkesbury, in 1773, the lord of the manor on enclosure, besides\r\nreserving 25 acres for the use of the poor, allowed land to each\r\ncottage sufficient to keep a horse or a cow, often added a small\r\nbuilding, and gave stocks for raising orchards. Even some of the\r\nidlest were thereby made industrious, poor rates sank to 4d. in the £,\r\nthough the population increased, and the labourer always had for sale\r\nsome poultry, or the produce of his cow, or some fruit.[570]\r\n\r\nIn 1800 the Board of Agriculture, composed almost entirely of\r\nlandowners, noticing that the poor of Rutland and Lincolnshire, who\r\nhad land for one or two cows and some potatoes, had not applied for\r\npoor relief, offered a gold medal for the most satisfactory account of\r\nthe best means of supporting cows on poor land, in a method applicable\r\nto cottagers.[571] Young recommended that in the case of extensive\r\nwastes every cottage on enclosure should be secured sufficient land on\r\nwhich to keep a cow, the land to be inalienable from the cottage and\r\nthe ownership vested in the parish.\r\n\r\nLord Winchelsea[572] urged that a good garden should always go with a\r\ncottage, and set the example himself, one which has been generally\r\nfollowed in England by the greater landlords with much success. As may\r\nbe imagined, these schemes or others similar to them were put into\r\neffect by the conscientious and energetic, but not by the apathetic\r\nand careless. Further, an Act was passed in the fifty-ninth year of\r\nGeorge III, which enabled parishes to lease or buy 20 acres of land\r\nfor the employment of their poor.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, it must be allowed, the grazing of the commons was\r\noften worth very little. Let one man, it was said in 1795, put a cow\r\non a common in spring for nothing, and let another pay a farmer 1s.\r\n6d. a week to keep a cow of equal value on enclosed land. When both\r\nare driven to market at Michaelmas the extra weight of the latter will\r\nmore than repay the cost of the keep, while her flow of milk meanwhile\r\nhas been much superior.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Waste Lands of 1795 attributed the great increase in\r\nthe weight of cattle not only to the improved methods of breeding, but\r\nto their being fed on good enclosed lands instead of wastes and\r\ncommons.[573] Even when commons were stinted they were in general\r\noverstocked, while disease was always being spread with enormous loss\r\nto the commoners. The larger holders, too, who had common rights,\r\noften crowded out the smaller.\r\n\r\nThere were often, as we have seen, a large number of 'squatters' on\r\ncommons who had seized and occupied land without any legal title. As a\r\nrule, if these people had been in possession twenty-one years their\r\ntitle was respected; if not, no regard was very justly paid to them on\r\nenclosure, and they were deprived of what they had seized.\r\n\r\nEden wrote when enclosure was at its height; he was a competent and\r\naccurate observer, and this is his picture of the 'commoner':[574]\r\n'The advantages which cottagers and poor people derive from commons\r\nand wastes are rather apparent than real; instead of sticking\r\nregularly to labour they waste their time in picking up a few dry\r\nsticks or in grubbing on some bleak moor. Their starved pig or two,\r\ntogether with a few wandering goslings, besides involving them in\r\nperpetual altercations with their neighbours, are dearly paid for in\r\ncare, time, and bought food. There are thousands and thousands of\r\nacres in the kingdom, now the sorry pastures of geese, hogs, asses,\r\nhalf-grown horses, and half-starved cattle, which want but to be\r\nenclosed to be as rich as any land now in tillage.'\r\n\r\nEnclosure worked an important social revolution. Before it the\r\nentirely landless labourer was rare: he nearly always had some holding\r\nin the common field or a right on the common pasture. With enclosure\r\nhis holding or right had generally disappeared, and he deteriorated\r\nsocially. It was very unfortunate, too, that when enclosure was most\r\nactive domestic industries, such as weaving, decayed, and deprived the\r\nlabourer and his family of a badly needed addition to his scanty\r\nincome.\r\n\r\nIn its physical and moral effects the system of domestic manufactures\r\nwas immensely preferable to that of the crowded factory, while\r\neconomically it enabled the tillers of the soil to exist on farms\r\nwhich could not support them by agriculture alone.\r\n\r\nThis uprooting of a great part of the agricultural population from the\r\nsoil by irresistible economic causes brought with it grave moral\r\nevils, and created divisions and antagonisms of interest from which we\r\nare suffering to-day.[575] If some such scheme as that of Arthur Young\r\nor Lord Winchelsea had been universally adopted, this blot on an\r\ninevitable movement might have been removed, and a healthy rural\r\npopulation planted on English soil. Another result followed, the\r\nlabourer no longer boarded as a rule in his employer's house, where\r\nthe farmer worked and lived with his men; the tie of mutual interest\r\nwas loosened, and he worked for this or that master indifferently. One\r\nadvantage, however, arose, in that, having to find a home of his own,\r\nhe married early, but this was vitiated by his knowledge that the\r\nparish would support his children, on which knowledge he was induced\r\nto rely.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the farmer often rose in the social scale. With\r\nthe abandonment of the handicaps and restrictions of the common-field\r\nsystem the efficient came more speedily to the front. It was they who\r\nhad amassed capital, and capital was now needed more than ever, so\r\nthey added field to field, and consolidated holdings.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1845 did away with the necessity for private Enclosure\r\nActs, still further reducing the expense; and since that date there\r\nhave been 80,000 or 90,000 acres of common arable fields and meadows\r\nenclosed without parliamentary sanction, and 139,517 acres of the same\r\nhave been enclosed with it,[576] besides many acres of commons and\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\nIn the _Report of the Committee of Enclosures_ of 1844,[577] there is\r\na curious description of the way in which common fields were sometimes\r\nallotted. There were in some open fields, lands called 'panes',\r\ncontaining forty or sixty different lands, and on a certain day the\r\nbest man of the parish appeared to take possession of any lot he\r\nthought fit. If his right was called in question there was a fight for\r\nit, and the survivor took the first lot, and so they went on through\r\nthe parish. There was also the old 'lot meadow' in which the owners\r\ndrew lots for choice of portions. On some of the grazing lands the\r\nright of grazing sheep belonged to a man called a 'flockmaster', who\r\nduring certain months of the year had the exclusive right of turning\r\nhis sheep on all the lands of the parish.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the subject of enclosure is that of the partial\r\ndisappearance of the small owner, both the yeoman who farmed his own\r\nlittle estate and the peasant proprietor. We have noticed above[578]\r\nGregory King's statement as to the number of small freeholders in\r\nEngland in 1688, no less than 160,000, or with their families about\r\none-seventh of the population of the country. This date, that of the\r\nRevolution, marks an epoch in their history, for from that time they\r\nbegan to diminish in proportion to the population. Their number in\r\n1688 is a sufficient answer to the exaggerated statement of\r\ncontemporaries in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as to the\r\ndepopulation caused by enclosures. Chamberlayne, in his _State of\r\nGreat Britain_, published at about the same time as Gregory King's\r\nfigures, says there were more freeholders in England than in any\r\ncountry of like extent in Europe: '£40 or £50 a year is very ordinary,\r\n£100 or £200 in some counties is not rare, sometimes in Kent and in\r\nthe Weald of Sussex £500 or £600 per annum, and £3,000 or £4,000 of\r\nstock.' In the first quarter of the eighteenth century he was a\r\nprominent figure. Defoe[579] describes the number and prosperity of\r\nthe Greycoats of Kent (as they were called from their homespun\r\ngarments), 'whose interest is so considerable that whoever they vote\r\nfor is always sure to carry it.'\r\n\r\nWhy has this sturdy class so dwindled in numbers, and left England\r\ninfinitely the weaker for their decrease? The causes are several;\r\nsocial, economic, and political. The chief, perhaps, is the peculiar\r\nform of Government which came in with the Revolution. The landed\r\ngentry by that event became supreme, the national and local\r\nadministration was entirely in their hands, and land being the\r\nfoundation of social and political influence was eagerly sought by\r\nthem where it was not already in their hands.[580] At the same time\r\nthe successful business men, whose numbers now increased rapidly from\r\nthe development of trade, bought land to 'make themselves gentlemen'.\r\nBoth these classes bought out the yeomen, who do not seem to have been\r\nvery loath to part with their land. The recently devised system of\r\nstrict family settlements enabled the old and the new gentlemen to\r\nkeep this land in their families. The complicated title to land made\r\nits transfer difficult and costly, so that there was little breaking\r\nup of estates to correspond with the constant buying up of small\r\nowners. To the smaller freeholder, as has been noticed, the enclosure\r\nof waste land did much harm, for it was necessary to his holding.\r\nAgain, smaller arable farms did not pay as well as large ones, so they\r\ntended to disappear. The decay of home industries was also a heavy\r\nblow to the smaller yeoman and the peasant proprietor.\r\n\r\nUnder this combination of circumstances many of the yeomen left the\r\nland. Yet though Young, less than a century after King and Davenant,\r\nsaid that the small freeholder had practically disappeared, there were\r\nat the end of the eighteenth century many left all over England, who\r\nhowever largely disappeared during the war and in the bad times after\r\nthe war.[581] But a contrary tendency was at work which helped to\r\nreplenish the class. The desire of the Englishman for land is not\r\nconfined to the wealthy classes. At the end of the eighteenth century\r\nmen who had made small fortunes in trade were buying small properties\r\nand taking the place of the yeomen.[582] In the great French War of\r\n1793-1815, many yeomen, attracted by the high prices of land, sold\r\ntheir properties, but at the same time many farmers, attracted by the\r\nhigh prices of produce, which had often enriched them, bought\r\nland.[583] During the 'good times' of 1853-75 many small holders, like\r\nthose of Axholme, noticed in the _Report_ of the Agricultural\r\nCommission of 1893, bought land.\r\n\r\nA new class of small owners also has sprung up, who, dwelling in or\r\nnear towns and railway stations, have bought small freeholds. The\r\nreturn of the owners of land of 1872-6 gave the following numbers of\r\nthose owning land in England and Wales[584]:\r\n\r\n  Total number of owners of:               Number.    Acreage.\r\n\r\n                 less than one acre        703,289    151,171\r\n                 1 acre and under 10       121,983    478,679\r\n                10       \"        50        72,640  1,750,079\r\n                50       \"       100        25,839  1,791,605\r\n               100       \"       500        32,317  6,827,346\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the first class here enumerated, those owning\r\nless than one acre, do not concern us, as they were evidently merely\r\nhouses and gardens not of an agricultural character, but a large\r\nnumber of the second class and most of the other three must have been\r\nagricultural, though unfortunately no distinction is made. It will be\r\nseen, therefore, that there were a considerable number of small\r\nowners in England in 1872, and their numbers have probably increased\r\nsince. Many of them, however, are of the new class mentioned above,\r\nand there appears to be no doubt that the number of the peasant\r\nproprietors and of the yeomen of the old sort has much diminished,\r\nespecially in proportion to the growth of population.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[562] Cf. supra, p. 163.\r\n\r\n[563] R.

The\r\nterm 'holdings', however, includes freeholds and leaseholds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n1816-1837\r\n\r\nDEPRESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1816 was wretched; the distress, aggravated by the bad\r\nseason, caused riots everywhere. At Bideford the mob interfered to\r\nprevent the export of a cargo of potatoes; at Bridport they broke\r\ninto the bakers' shops. Incendiary fires broke out night after night\r\nin the eastern counties. At Swanage six people out of seven were\r\npaupers, and in one parish in Cambridgeshire every person but one was\r\na pauper or a bankrupt.[585] Corn rose again: by June, 1817, it was 117s.,\r\nbut fell to 77s. in September.\r\n\r\nIn 1818 occurred a drought of four months, lasting from May till\r\nSeptember, and great preparations were made to ward off the expected\r\nfamine; immense quantities of wheat came from the Baltic, of maize\r\nfrom America, and beans and maize from Italy and Egypt, with hay from\r\nNew York, as it was selling at £10 a ton. However, rain fell in\r\nSeptember, brown fields suddenly became green, turnips sprang up\r\nwhere none had appeared, and even spring corn that had lain in the\r\nparched ground began to grow, so the fear of scarcity passed.\r\n\r\nIn 1822 came a good season, which produced a great crop of wheat; in\r\nthe lifetime of the existing generation old men declared that such a\r\nharvest had been known only once before; imports also came from\r\nIreland to the amount of nearly a million quarters, so that the price\r\nat the end of the year was 38s., and the average price for the year\r\nwas 44s. 7d. Beef went down to 2s. 5d. a stone and mutton to 2s. 2d.\r\nThe cry of agricultural distress again rose loudly. Farmers were\r\nstill, though some of the war taxes had been remitted, heavily taxed;\r\nfor the taxes on malt, soap, salt, candles, leather, all pressed\r\nheavily.[586] The chief cause of the distress was the long-felt\r\nreaction after the war, but it was aggravated by the return to cash\r\npayments in 1819. Gold had fallen to its real value, and the fall in\r\ngold had been followed by a fall in the prices of every other\r\narticle.[587] The produce of many thousand acres in England did not\r\nsell that year for as much money as was expended in growing it,\r\nwithout reckoning rent, taxes, and interest on capital.[588] Estates\r\nworth £3,000 a year, says the same writer, some years since, were now\r\nworth £1,000. Bacon had gone down from 6s. 6d. to 2s. 4d. a stone;\r\nSouthdown ewes from 50s. to 15s., and lambs from 42s. to 5s.\r\n\r\nA Dorset farmer told the Parliamentary committee that since 1815 he\r\nknew of fifty farmers, farming 24,000 acres, who had failed\r\nentirely.[589]\r\n\r\nIn the _Tyne Mercury_ of October 30, 1821, it was recorded that Mr.\r\nThos. Cooper of Bow purchased 3 milch cows and 40 sheep for £18 16s.\r\n6d. which sum four years previously would only have bought their\r\nskins. Prime beef was sold in Salisbury market at 4d. retail, and good\r\njoints of mutton at 3-1/2d.[590] Everywhere the farmers were\r\ncomplaining bitterly, but 'hanging on like sailors to the masts or\r\nhull of a wreck'. In Sussex labourers were being employed to dig holes\r\nand fill them in again, proof enough of distress but also of great\r\nfolly. Many thousands of acres were now a mass of thistles and weeds,\r\nonce fair grass land ploughed up during the war for wheat, and\r\nabandoned at the fall of prices. There were no less than 475 petitions\r\non agricultural distress presented to the House from 1820 to March 31,\r\n1822. In 1822, it was proposed that the Government should purchase\r\nwheat grown in England to the value of one million sterling and store\r\nit; also that when the average price of wheat was under 60s. the\r\nGovernment should advance money on such corn grown in the United\r\nKingdom as should be deposited in certain warehouses, to an extent not\r\nexceeding two-thirds the value of the corn.[591] There were not\r\nwanting men, however, who put the other side of the question. In a\r\ntract called _The Refutation of the Arguments used on the Subject of\r\nthe Agricultural Petition_, written in 1819, it was said that the\r\nincrease in the farmer's expenditure was the cause of his discontent.\r\n'He now assumes the manners and demands the equipage of a gentleman,\r\nkeeps a table like his landlord, anticipates seasons in their\r\nproductions, is as choice in his wines, his horses, and his\r\nfurniture.' Let him be more thrifty. 'Let him dismiss his steward, a\r\ncharacter a few years back only known to the great landowner, and\r\ncease from degrading the British farmer into a synonym for\r\nprodigality.' Lord Liverpool, in the House of Lords, in a speech which\r\nroused great opposition among agriculturists, minimized the distress;\r\ndistress there was, he admitted, but it was not confined to England,\r\nit was world-wide; neither was it produced by excessive taxation, for\r\nsince 1815 taxation had been reduced 25 per cent., while though rents\r\nand prices had fallen they were much higher than before the war.\r\nAnother writer said at the time, 'Individuals of all classes have of\r\nlate been as it were inflated above their natural size: let this\r\nunnatural growth be reduced; let them resume their proper places and\r\nappearances, and the quantum of substantial enjoyment, real comfort\r\nand happiness, will not be found lessened.' It was also asserted that\r\nthe taxes on malt, leather, soap, salt, and candles, were not very\r\npressing.\r\n\r\nThe persistent cries of distress produced a Bill giving still further\r\nprotection to corn-growers, which was fortunately not carried into\r\neffect. There was no doubt, however, about the reality of the crisis\r\nthrough which the landed classes were passing. Many of the landowners\r\nwere heavily in debt. Mortgages had been multiplied during the war,\r\nand while prices were high payment of interest was easy; but when\r\nprices fell and the tenant threw up his farm, the landlord could not\r\nthrow over the mortgage, and the interest hung like a dead weight\r\nround his neck.[592]\r\n\r\nThe price to which wheat fell at the end of 1822 was to be the lowest\r\nfor some years; it soon recovered, and until 1834 the average annual\r\nprices ranged from 53s. to 68s. 6d., while in 1825 beef at Smithfield\r\nwas 5s. and mutton 5s. 4d. a stone.\r\n\r\nIn 1823 there was a marked improvement, and the king's speech\r\ncongratulated the country on 'the gradual abatement of those\r\ndifficulties under which agriculture has so long suffered.'[593] In\r\n1824 'agriculture was recovering from the depression under which it\r\nlaboured.'[594] In 1825 it was said, 'there never was a period in the\r\nhistory of this country when all the great interests of the nation\r\nwere in so thriving a condition.'[595] In that year over-speculation\r\nproduced a panic and agricultural distress was again evident. In 1826\r\nCobbett said, 'the present stock of the farms is not in one-half the\r\ncases the property of the farmer, it is borrowed stock.'[596] In 1828\r\nall the farmers in Kent were said to be insolvent.[597]\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of Parliament in 1830 the king lamented the state of\r\naffairs, and ascribed it to unfavourable seasons and other causes\r\nbeyond the reach of legislative remedy. Many had learnt that high\r\nprotection was no protection for farmers, and it was stated more than\r\nonce that the large foreign supply of grain, though only then about\r\none-third of the home-grown, depressed our markets. At the same time,\r\nit must be admitted that agriculture, like all other industries, was\r\nsuffering from the crisis of 1825. In 1830, the country was filled\r\nwith unrest, in which the farm labourer shared. His motives, however,\r\nwere hardly political. He had a rooted belief that machinery was\r\ninjuring him, the threshing machine especially; and he avenged himself\r\nby burning the ricks of obnoxious farmers. Letters were sent to\r\nemployers demanding higher wages and the disuse of machines, and\r\nnotices signed 'Swing' were affixed to gates and buildings. Night\r\nafter night incendiary fires broke out, and emboldened by impunity the\r\nrioters proceeded to pillage by day. In Hampshire they moved in bodies\r\n1,500 strong. A special Commission was appointed, and the disorders\r\nput down at last with a firm hand. In 1828 there had been a relaxation\r\nin the duties on corn, the object of the Act passed in that year being\r\nto secure the farmer a constant price of 8s. a bushel instead of 10s.\r\nas in 1815, and by a sliding scale to prevent the disastrous\r\nfluctuations in prices. The best proof of its failure is afforded by\r\nthe appointment of another parliamentary committee in 1833 to inquire\r\ninto the distressed state of agriculture. At this inquiry many\r\nwitnesses asserted that the cultivation of inferior soils and heavy\r\nclays had diminished from one-fourth to one-fifth.[598] It was also\r\nasserted that farmers were paying rent out of capital.[599] Tooke,\r\nhowever, thought there was much exaggeration of the distress, which\r\nwas proved by the way the farmers weathered the low prices of 1835,\r\nwhen wheat, after a succession of four remarkably good seasons,\r\naveraged 39s. 4d. for the year. In these abundant years, too, he\r\nasserts that the home supply was equal to the demand,[600] though the\r\ncommittee of 1833 had stated that this had ceased to be the\r\ncase.[601] Another committee, the last for many years, sat in 1835 to\r\nconsider the distress; but although prices were low the whole tenor of\r\nthe evidence established the improvement of farming, the extension of\r\ncultivation, and the increase of produce, and it was noticed at this\r\ntime that towns dependent on agriculture were uniformly\r\nprosperous.[602]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, in spite of exaggeration from interested motives, the\r\ndistress for the twenty years after the battle of Waterloo was real\r\nand deep; twenty years of depression succeeded the same period of\r\nfalse exaltation. The progress, too, during that time was real, and\r\nmade, as was remarked, _because_ of adversity. From this time\r\nagriculture slowly revived.\r\n\r\nOn one point both of the two last committees were agreed, that the\r\ncondition of the labourer was improved, and they said he was better\r\noff than at any former period, for his wages remained the same, while\r\nprices of necessaries had fallen. That his wages went further is true,\r\nbut they were still miserably low, and he was often housed worse than\r\nthe animals on the farm. 'Wattle and dab' (or mud and straw) formed\r\nthe walls of his cottage, the floors were often of mud, and all ages\r\nand both sexes frequently slept in one room. A block of ten cottages\r\nwere put up in the parish of Holmer[603] at the commencement of the\r\nnineteenth century, which were said to have combined 'comfort,\r\nconvenience, and economy;' they each contained one room 12 feet by 14\r\nfeet and 6 feet high with a bedroom over, and cost £32 10s. each. They\r\nwere evidently considered quite superior dwellings, far better than\r\nthe ordinary run of labourer's cottages. Cobbett gives us a picture of\r\nsome in Leicestershire in 1826; 'hovels made of mud and straw, bits of\r\nglass, or of old cast-off windows, without frames or hinges\r\nfrequently, and merely stuck in the mud wall. Enter them and look at\r\nthe bits of chairs or stools, the wretched boards tacked together to\r\nserve for a table, the floor of pebble, broken brick, or of the bare\r\nground; look at the thing called a bed, and survey the rags on the\r\nbacks of the wretched inhabitants.'[604] The chief exceptions to this\r\nstate of affairs were the estates of many of the great landlords. On\r\nthat of the Earl of Winchelsea in Rutland, the cottages he had built\r\ncontained a kitchen, parlour, dairy, two bedrooms, and a cow-house,\r\nand several had small holdings attached of from 5 to 20 acres.[605]\r\nNot long before, wages in Hampshire and Wiltshire were 5s. and 6s. a\r\nweek.[606]\r\n\r\nIn 1822 it was stated that 'beef and mutton are things the taste of\r\nwhich was unknown to the mass of labourers. No one has lived more in\r\ncottages than I, and I declare solemnly I never remember once to have\r\nseen such a thing.'[607] A group of women labourers, whom Cobbett saw\r\nby the roadside in Hampshire, presented 'such an assemblage of rags as\r\nI never saw before even amongst the hoppers at Farnham.'[608]\r\n\r\nThe labourer's wages may have gone a little further, but he had lost\r\nhis by-industries, his bit of land and rights of common, and would\r\nhave had a very different tale to tell from that of the framers of the\r\nreports above quoted.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the complaints made that the improvements of the coaches\r\nand of the roads drew the countryman to the towns, many stirred hardly\r\nat all from their native parish, and their lives were now infinitely\r\nduller than in the Middle Ages. The great event of the year was the\r\nharvest home, which was usually a scene of great merry-making. In\r\nDevonshire, when a farmer's wheat was ripe he sent round notice to the\r\nneighbourhood, and men and women from all sides came to reap the crop.\r\nAs early as eleven or twelve, so much ale and cider had been drunk\r\nthat the shouts and ribald jokes of the company were heard to a\r\nconsiderable distance, attracting more helpers, who came from far and\r\nnear, but none were allowed to come after 12 o'clock. Between 12 and 1\r\ncame dinner, with copious libations of ale and cider, which lasted\r\ntill 2, when reaping was resumed and went on without interruption\r\nexcept from the squabbles of the company till 5, when what were called\r\n'drinkings', or more food and drink, were taken into the field and\r\nconsumed. After this the corn reaped was bound into sheaves till\r\nevening, when after the sport of throwing their reaping hooks at a\r\nsheaf which had been set up as a mark for a prize, all proceeded to\r\nsupper and more ale and cider till the small hours.[609]\r\n\r\nNo wages were paid at these harvestings, but the unlimited amount of\r\neating and drinking was very expensive, and about this date the\r\npractice of using hired labour had largely superseded this old custom.\r\n\r\nThe close of this period was marked by two Acts of great benefit to\r\nfarmers: the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 (4 & 5 Wm. IV, c. 76),\r\nwhich reduced the rates,[610] and marked 'the beginning of a period\r\nof slow recovery in the labourer's standard of life, moral and\r\nmaterial, though at first it brought him not a little adversity'[611];\r\nand the Tithe Commutation Act of 1836 (6 & 7 Wm. IV, c. 71), which\r\nsubstituted for the tithe paid in kind or the fluctuating commuted\r\ntithe, a tithe rent charge equivalent to the market value, on a\r\nseptennial average, of the exact quantities of wheat, barley, and\r\noats, which made up the legal tithes by the estimate in 1836. Thus was\r\nremoved a perpetual source of dispute and antagonism between\r\ntithe-payer and tithe-owner. The system hitherto pursued, moreover,\r\nwas wasteful. In exceptionally favourable circumstances the clergy did\r\nnot receive more than two-thirds of the value of the tithe in kind.\r\nThe delays were a frequent source of loss. In rainy weather, when the\r\nfarmer desired to get his crops in quickly, he was obliged to shock\r\nhis crops, give the tithe-owners notice to set out their tithes, and\r\nwait for their arrival; in the meantime the crop, perhaps, being badly\r\ndamaged.[612]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[585] Walpole, _History of England_, i. 161.\r\n\r\n[586] _Inquiry into Agricultural Distress_ (1822), p. 40.\r\n\r\n[587] Walpole, _op. cit._ ii. 22.\r\n\r\n[588] _A Letter to the Earl of Liverpool by an Old Tory_, 1822.

Instead of repeatedly calling on Parliament to help them\r\nthey had helped themselves, by spending large sums in draining and\r\nmanuring the land; they had adopted the subsoil plough, and the\r\ndrainage system of Smith of Deanston, used machinery to economize\r\nlabour, and improved the breed of stock. This was an object-lesson\r\nfor the English farmer, and he began to profit by it. It was high\r\ntime that he did. In spite of the undoubted progress made, farming\r\nwas still often terribly backward. Little or no machinery was used,\r\nimplements were often bad, teams too large, drilling little\r\npractised, drainage utterly inefficient; in fact, while one farmer\r\nused all the improvements made, a hundred had little to do with them.\r\nBut better times were at hand.\r\n\r\nAbout 1835 Elkington's system of drainage, which among the more\r\nadvanced agriculturists, at any rate, had been used for half a\r\ncentury, was superseded by that of James Smith of Deanston, a system\r\nof thorough drainage and deep ploughing, which effected a complete\r\nrevolution in the art of draining, and holds the field to-day.\r\nHitherto the draining of land had been done by a few drains where they\r\nwere thought necessary, which was often a failure. Smith initiated a\r\ncomplete system of parallel underground drains, near enough to each,\r\nother to catch all the superfluous water, running into a main drain\r\nwhich ran along the lowest part of the ground. His system has also\r\nbeen called 'furrow or frequent draining', as the drains were\r\ngenerally laid in the furrows from two to two-and-a-half feet deep at\r\nshort intervals. Even then the tributary drains were at first filled\r\nin with stones 12 inches deep, as they had been for centuries, and\r\nsometimes with thorns, or even turves, as tiles were still expensive;\r\nand the main was made of stonework. However, the invention of machines\r\nfor making tiles cheapened them, and the substitution of cylindrical\r\npipes for horse-shoe tiles laid on flat soles still further lowered\r\nthe cost and increased the efficiency.[613] In 1848, Peel introduced\r\nGovernment Drainage Loans, repayable by twenty-two instalments of 6\r\n1/2 per cent. This was consequently an era of extensive drainage works\r\nall over England, which sorely needed it; but even now the work was\r\noften badly done. In some cases it was the custom for the tenant to\r\nput in as many tiles as his landlord gave him, and they were often\r\nmerely buried. At Stratfieldsaye, for instance, where the Iron Duke\r\nwas a generous and capable landlord, the drains were sometimes a foot\r\ndeep, while others were 6 feet deep and 60 feet apart,[614] although\r\nthe soil required nothing of the kind.\r\n\r\nVast sums were also spent on farm-buildings, still often old and\r\nrickety, with deficient and insanitary accommodation; in Devonshire\r\nthe farmer was bound by his lease to repair 'old mud and wooden\r\nhouses', at a cost of 10 per cent. on his rent, and there were many\r\nsuch all over England. Farm-buildings were often at the extreme end\r\nof the holding, the cattle were crowded together in draughty sheds,\r\nand the farmyard was generally a mass of filth and spoiling manure,\r\nspoiling because all the liquid was draining away from it into the\r\npool where the live stock drank; a picture, alas, often true to-day.\r\nIt was to bring the great mass of landlords and farmers into line with\r\nthose who had made the most of what progress there had been, that the\r\nRoyal Society was founded in 1838, in imitation of the Highland\r\nSociety, but also owing to the realization of the great benefits\r\nconferred on farming during the last half-century by the exertions of\r\nAgricultural Societies, the Smithfield Club Shows having especially\r\naided the breeding of live stock.\r\n\r\nWriting on the subject of the Society, Mr. Handley[615] spoke of the\r\nwretched modes of farming still to be seen in the country, especially\r\nin the case of arable land, though there had been a marked improvement\r\nin the breeding of stock. Prejudice, as ever, was rampant. Bone\r\nmanure, though in the previous twenty years it had worked wonders, was\r\nin many parts unused. It was felt that what the English farmer needed\r\nwas 'practice with science'. The first President of the Society was\r\nEarl Spencer, and it at once set vigorously to work, recommending\r\nprizes for essays on twenty-four subjects, some of which are in the\r\nfirst volume of the Society's Journal. Prizes were also offered for\r\nthe best draining-plough, the best implement for crushing gorse, for a\r\nploughing match to be held at the first country meeting of the Society\r\nfixed at Oxford in 1839, for the best cultivated farm in Oxfordshire\r\nand the adjacent counties, and for the invention of any new\r\nagricultural implement.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 the Society was granted a charter under the title of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society of England, and its career since then has been\r\none of continued usefulness, and forms a prominent feature in the\r\nagricultural history of the times.\r\n\r\nIn 1839[616] the first country meeting of the Society was held at\r\nOxford, and its 247 entries of live stock and 54 of implements were\r\ndescribed as constituting a show of unprecedented magnitude. According\r\nto _Bell's Weekly Messenger_ for July 22, 1839, the show for some time\r\nhad been the all-absorbing topic of conversation not only among\r\nagriculturists, but among the community at large, and the first day\r\n20,000 people attended the show, many having come great distances by\r\nroad. Everybody and every exhibit had to get to Oxford by road; some\r\nShorthorn cattle, belonging to the famous Thomas Bates of\r\nKirkleavington, took nearly three weeks on the road, coming from\r\nLondon to Aylesbury by canal. But such a journey was not unusual then,\r\nfor cattle were often two or three weeks on the road to great fairs,\r\nand stood the journey best on hay; it was surprising how fresh and\r\nsound they finished.[617] The show ground covered 7 acres, and among\r\nthe implements tested was a subsoil plough, Biddell's Scarifier, and a\r\ndrill for depositing manure after turnips. There were only six classes\r\nfor cattle--Shorthorns, Herefords, Devons, Cattle of any other breed,\r\nDairy Cattle, and Oxen; one class for horses, and three for\r\nsheep--Leicesters, Southdown or other Short Wool, and Long Woolled;\r\nwith one for pigs.[618] The Shorthorns, with the exception of the\r\nKirkleavingtons, were bred in the neighbourhood, and many good judges\r\nsaid long afterwards that a finer lot had not been seen since. The\r\nDuchesses especially impressed all who saw them. The rest of the live\r\nstock was in no way remarkable.\r\n\r\nFrom this small beginning, then thought so much of, the show grew\r\nfast, and the Warwick meeting[619] of 1892, after several years of\r\nagricultural depression, illustrates the excellent work of the Society\r\nand the enormous progress made by English agriculture. The show ground\r\ncovered 90 acres; horses were now divided into Thoroughbred Stallions,\r\nHunters, Coach Horses, Hackneys, Ponies, Harness Horses and Ponies,\r\nShires, Clydesdales, Suffolks, and Agricultural Horses. Cattle were\r\nclassified as Shorthorns, Herefords, Devons, Sussex, Longhorns\r\n(described as few in number and of no particular quality, 'a breed\r\nwhich has now been many years on the wane', but has recently been\r\nrevived),[620] Welsh, Red Polled, Jerseys, Guernseys, Kerry and\r\nDexter-Kerry.\r\n\r\nThe increased variety of sheep was also striking; Leicesters,\r\nCotswolds, Lincolns, Oxford Downs, Shropshires, Southdowns, Hampshire\r\nDowns, Suffolks, Border Leicesters, Clun Forest, and Welsh Mountain.\r\n\r\nPigs were divided into Large, Middle, and Small white Berkshires, any\r\nother black breed, and Tamworths.\r\n\r\nAltogether the total number of stock exhibited was 1,858, and the\r\nnumber of implements was 5,430.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 appeared Liebig's _Chemistry in its Application to Agriculture\r\nand Physiology_, tracing the relations between the nutrition of plants\r\nand the composition of the soil, a book which was received with\r\nenthusiasm, and completely changed the attitude which agriculturists\r\ngenerally had maintained towards chemistry; one of contempt, founded\r\non ignorance.\r\n\r\nBut, as Mr. Prothero has said,[621] 'if the new agriculture was born\r\nin the laboratory of Glissen, it grew into strength at the\r\nexperimental station of Rothamsted.' There, for more than half a\r\ncentury, Lawes and Gilbert conducted experiments, of vast benefit to\r\nagriculture, in the objects, method, and effect of manuring; the\r\nscientific bases for the rotation of crops, and the results of various\r\nfoods on animals in the production of meat, milk, and manure.\r\n\r\nThe use of artificial manures now spread rapidly; bones, used long\r\nbefore uncrushed, are said to have been first crushed in 1772, and\r\ntheir value was realized by Coke of Holkham, but for long they were\r\ncrushed by hammer or horse mill, and their use was consequently\r\nlimited. Then iron rollers worked by steam ground them cheaply and\r\neffectively, and their use soon spread, though it was not till about\r\n1840 that it can be said to have become general. Its effects were\r\noften described as wonderful. In Cheshire, cheese-making had\r\nexhausted the soil, and it was said that by boning and draining an\r\nadditional cow could be kept for every 4 acres, and tenants readily\r\npaid 7 per cent. to their landlords for expenditure in bone manure.\r\nIts use had indeed raised many struggling farmers to comparative\r\nindependence.[622] A very large quantity of the bones used came from\r\nSouth America.[623] Porter also noticed that 'since 1840 an extensive\r\ntrade has been carried on in an article called Guano', the guana of\r\nDavy, 'from the islands of the Pacific and off the coast of Africa'.\r\nNitrate of soda was just coming in, but was not much used till some\r\nyears later. In 1840 Liebig suggested the treatment of bones with\r\nsulphuric acid, and in 1843 Lawes patented the process and set up his\r\nworks at Deptford.[624]\r\n\r\nItalian rye grass, not to be confounded with the old English ray\r\ngrass, had been introduced by Thomson of Banchory, in 1834, from\r\nMunich;[625] and though the swede was known at the end of the\r\neighteenth century, in many parts it had only just become common. In\r\nNotts it was in 1844 described as having recently become 'the\r\nsheet-anchor of the farmer'.[626] In Cheshire a writer at the same\r\ndate said, 'in the year 1814 there were not 5 acres of Swedish turnips\r\ngrown in the parish where I reside; now there are from 60 to 80, and\r\nin many parts of the county the increase has been in a much greater\r\nratio.'[627]\r\n\r\nAbout this time a remedy was found in the south for leaving the land\r\nidle during the nine months between harvesting the corn crop in\r\nAugust, and sowing the turnip crop in the following June, by sowing\r\nrye, which was eaten green by the sheep in May, a good preparation for\r\nthe succeeding winter crop. Turnip cutters were at last being used,\r\nand corn and cake crushers soon followed.\r\n\r\nThe seasons from 1838 to 1841 were bad, and must be characterized as\r\na period of dearth, wheat keeping at a good price.[628] That of 1844-5\r\nwas remarkable for the first general appearance of the potato disease,\r\nnot only in these islands but on the continent of Europe.[629] In\r\nAugust, 1846, the worst apprehensions of the failure of the crop were\r\nmore than realized, and the terrible results in Ireland are well\r\nknown. In the early part of 1847 there was a fear of scarcity in corn,\r\nand the price of wheat rose to 102s. 5d. in spite of an importation of\r\n4,500,000 quarters, but this was largely owing to the absence of any\r\nreliable agricultural statistics, which were not furnished till 1866,\r\nand the price soon fell.[630]\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the period of free trade, when the Corn Laws,\r\nwhich had protected agriculture more or less effectually for so long,\r\nwere definitely abandoned. That they had failed to prevent great\r\nfluctuations in the price of corn is abundantly evident, it is also\r\nequally evident that they kept up the average price; in the ten years\r\nfrom 1837 to 1846, the average price of wheat was 58s. 7d. a quarter,\r\nin the seven years from 1848 to 1853, the average price was 48s.\r\n2d.[631]\r\n\r\nThe average imports of wheat and flour for the same period were\r\n2,161,813 and 4,401,000 quarters respectively. But to obtain the real\r\neffect of free trade on prices, the prices for the period between 1815\r\nand 1846 must be compared with those between 1846 and the present day,\r\nwhen the fall is enormous.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1815, which Tooke said had failed to secure any one of the\r\nobjects aimed at by its promoters, had received two important\r\nalterations. In 1828 (9 Geo. IV, c. 60) a duty of 36s. 8d. was imposed\r\nwhen the price was 50s., decreasing to 1s. when it was 73s.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 (5 Vict. c. 14) a duty of 20s. was imposed when the price was\r\n50s., and the duty became 7s. when the price reached 65s.\r\n\r\nA contemporary writer denies that these duties benefited the farmer at\r\nall: 'if the present shifting scale of duty was intended to protect\r\nthe farmer, keep the prices of corn steady, insure a supply to the\r\nconsumer at a moderate price, and benefit the revenue, it has signally\r\nfailed. During the continuation of the Corn Laws the farmers have\r\nsuffered the greatest privations. The variations in price have been\r\nextreme, and when a supply of foreign corn has been required it has\r\nonly reached the consumer at a high price, and benefited the revenue\r\nlittle.'[632] Rents of farms were often calculated not on the market\r\nprice of wheat, but on the price thought to be fixed by the duties,\r\nwhich was occasionally much higher.[633]\r\n\r\nIt was also said that but for the restrictions that had been imposed\r\nin the supposed interests of agriculture, the skill and enterprise of\r\nfarmers would have been better directed than it had been. By means of\r\nthese restrictions and the consequent enhancement of the cost of\r\nliving, the cultivation of the land had been injuriously restricted,\r\nfor the energies of farmers had been limited to producing certain\r\ndescriptions of food, and they had neglected others which would have\r\nbeen far[634] more profitable. The landlord had profited by higher\r\nrents, but, according to Caird, a most competent observer, had\r\ngenerally speaking been induced by a reliance on protection to neglect\r\nhis duty to his estates, so that buildings were poor, and drainage\r\nneglected. The labourer was little if any better off than eighty years\r\nbefore. It was a mystery even to farmers how they lived in many parts\r\nof the country; 'our common drink,' said one, 'is burnt crust tea, we\r\nnever know what it is to get enough to eat.'[635] Against these\r\ndisadvantages can only be put the fact that protection had kept up the\r\nprice of corn, a calamity for the mass of the people.\r\n\r\nThe amount of wheat imported into England before the era of Corn Law\r\nrepeal was inconsiderable. Mr. Porter has shown[636] how very small a\r\nproportion of wheat used in this country was imported from 1801-44.\r\nFrom 1801 to 1810 the average annual import of wheat into the kingdom\r\nwas 600,946 quarters, or a little over a peck annually per head, the\r\naverage annual consumption per head being about eight bushels. Between\r\n1811 and 1820 the average importation was 458,578 quarters, or for the\r\nincreased population a gallon-and-a-half per head, and the same share\r\nfor each person was imported in the next decade 1821-30. From 1831-40\r\nthe average imports arose to 607,638 quarters, or two-and-a-quarter\r\ngallons per head, and in 1841-4 an average import of 1,901,495\r\nquarters raised the average supply to four-and-a-half gallons per\r\nperson, still a very small proportion of the amount consumed.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 a small association had been formed in London for advocating\r\nthe repeal of the Corn Laws, and in 1838 a similar association was\r\nformed in Manchester.[637] At one of its earliest meetings appeared\r\nRichard Cobden, under whose guidance the association became the\r\nAnti-Corn Law League, and at whose invitation John Bright joined the\r\nLeague. Under these two men the Anti-Corn Law League commenced its\r\ngreat agitation, its object being 'to convince the manufacturer that\r\nthe Corn Laws were interfering with the growth of trade, to persuade\r\nthe people that they were raising the price of food, to teach the\r\nagriculturist that they had not even the solitary merit of securing a\r\nfixed price for corn'. The country was deluged with pamphlets, backed\r\nup by constant public meetings; and these efforts, aided by\r\nunfavourable seasons, convinced many of the errors of protection. In\r\n1840 the League spent £5,700 in distributing 160,000 circulars and\r\n150,000 pamphlets, and in delivering 400 lectures to 800,000 people.\r\nBakers were persuaded to bake taxed and untaxed shilling loaves, and,\r\non the purchaser choosing the larger, to demand the tax from the\r\nlandlord; in 1843 the League collected £50,000, next year £100,000,\r\nand in 1845 £250,000 in support of their agitation.\r\n\r\nYet for some years they had little success in Parliament; even in 1842\r\nPeel only amended the laws; and it was not until 1846 that, convinced\r\nby the League's arguments, as he himself confessed, and stimulated by\r\nthe famine in Ireland, he introduced the famous Act, 9 & 10 Vict. c.\r\n22.\r\n\r\nBy this the maximum duty on imported wheat was at once to be reduced\r\nto 10s. a quarter when the price was under 48s., to 5s. on barley when\r\nthe price was under 26s., and to 4s. on oats when the price was under\r\n18s., with lower duties as prices rose above these figures, but the\r\nmost important part of the Act was that on February 1, 1849, these\r\nduties were to cease, and only a nominal duty of 1s. a quarter on\r\nforeign corn be retained, which was abolished in 1860.\r\n\r\nBy 9 and 10 Vict. c. 23 the duties on live stock were also abolished\r\nentirely. Down to 1842 the importation of horned cattle, sheep, hogs,\r\nand other animals used as food was strictly prohibited,[638] but in\r\nthat year the prohibition was withdrawn and they were allowed to enter\r\nthe country on a payment of 20s. a head on oxen and bulls, 15s. on\r\ncows, 3s. on sheep, 5s. on hogs; which duties continued till 1846.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to find that so shrewd an observer as McCulloch did\r\nnot expect any great increase in the imports of live animals from the\r\nreduction of the duties, but he anticipated a great increase in salted\r\nmeat from abroad; cold storage being then undreamt of.\r\n\r\nThe full effect of this momentous change was not to be felt for a\r\ngeneration, but the immediate effect was an agricultural panic\r\napparently justified by falling prices. In 1850 wheat averaged 40s.\r\n3d. and in 1851 38s. 6d. On the other hand, stock farmers were doing\r\nwell. But on the corn lands the prices of the protection era had to\r\ncome down; many farms were thrown up, some arable turned into pasture;\r\ndistress was widespread. Owing to the depressed state of agriculture\r\nin 1850, the _Times_ sent James Caird on a tour through England, and\r\none of the most important conclusions arrived at in his account of his\r\ntour is, that owing to protection, the majority of landowners had\r\nneglected their land; but another cause of neglect was that the great\r\nbody of English landlords knew nothing of the management of their\r\nestates, and committed it to agents who knew little more and merely\r\nreceived the rents. The important business of being a landowner is the\r\nonly one for which no special training is provided. Many of the\r\nlandlords, however, then, as now, were unable to improve their estates\r\nif they desired to do so, as they were hopelessly encumbered, and the\r\nexpense of sale was almost prohibitive. The contrast between good and\r\nbad farmers was more marked in 1850 than to-day, the efforts of the\r\nRoyal Agricultural Society to raise the general standard of farming\r\nhad not yet borne much fruit. In many counties, side by side, were\r\nfarmers who used every modern improvement, and those who still\r\nemployed the methods of the eighteenth century: on one farm wheat\r\nproducing 40 bushels an acre, threshed by steam at a cost of 3s. 6d.,\r\non the next 20 bushels to the acre threshed by the flail at a cost of\r\n9s.[639]\r\n\r\nDrainage in the counties where it was needed had made considerable\r\nprogress, the removal of useless hedgerows often crowded with timber,\r\nthat kept the sun from the crops and whose roots absorbed much of the\r\nnourishment of the soil, was slowly extending, but farm-buildings\r\nalmost everywhere were defective. 'The inconvenient ill-arranged\r\nhovels, the rickety wood and thatch barns and sheds devoid of every\r\nknown improvement for economizing labour, food, and manure, which are\r\nto be met with in every county in England, are a reproach to the\r\nlandlords in the eyes of all good farmers.'[640] The farm-buildings of\r\nBelgium, Holland, France, and the Rhenish Provinces were much\r\nsuperior. In parts of England indeed no progress seems to have been\r\nmade for generations at this date. Thousands of acres of peat moss in\r\nLancashire were unreclaimed, and many parts of the Fylde district were\r\ndifficult even to traverse. Even in Warwickshire, in the heart of\r\nEngland, between Knowle and Tamworth, instead of signs of industry and\r\nimprovement were narrow winding lanes leading to nothing, traversed by\r\nlean pigs and rough cattle, broad copse-like hedges, small and\r\nirregular fields of couch, amidst which straggled the stalks of some\r\nsmothered cereal; these with gipsy encampments and the occasional\r\nsound of the poacher's gun from woods and thickets around were the\r\ncharacteristics of the district.[641]\r\n\r\nLeases were the exception throughout England, though more prevalent in\r\nthe west.[642] The greater proportion of farms were held on yearly\r\nagreements terminable by six months' notice on either side, a system\r\npreferred by the landlord as enabling him to retain a greater hold\r\nover his land, and acquiesced in by the tenant because of easy rents.\r\nIn spite of this insecurity of tenure and the absence of Agricultural\r\nHoldings Acts, the tenants invested their capital largely with no\r\nother security than the landlord's character, 'for in no country of\r\nthe world does the character of any class of men stand so high for\r\nfair and generous dealing as that of the great body of the English\r\nlandlords.'\r\n\r\nThe custom of tenant-right was unknown except in certain counties,\r\nSurrey, Sussex, the Weald of Kent, Lincoln, North Notts, and in part\r\nof the West Riding of Yorkshire.[643] Where it existed, the\r\nagriculture was on the whole inferior to that of the districts where\r\nit did not, and it had frequently led to fraud in a greater or less\r\ndegree. Many farmers were in the practice of 'working up to a\r\nquitting', or making a profit by the difference which their ingenuity\r\nand that of their valuer enabled them to demand at leaving as compared\r\nwith what they paid on entry. The best farmers as well as the\r\nlandlords were said to be disgusted with the system. The dislike for\r\nleases in the days immediately before the repeal of the Corn Laws was\r\npartly due to the uncertainty how long protection would last; but\r\nchiefly then, as afterwards, to the fact that if a man improved his\r\nfarm under a lease he had nearly always to pay an increased rent on\r\nrenewal, but if he held from year to year his improvement, if any, was\r\nso gradual and imperceptible that it was hardly noticed and the rent\r\nwas not raised. It may also be attributable to the modern\r\ndisinclination to be bound down to a particular spot for a long\r\nperiod. At all events, the general dislike of farmers for leases is a\r\ncurious commentary on the assertions of those writers who said that\r\nleases were his chief necessity.\r\n\r\nThe disparity of the labourer's wages in 1850 was most remarkable,\r\nranging from 15s. a week in parts of Lancashire to 6s. in South Wilts,\r\nthe average of the northern counties being 11s. 6d., and of the\r\nsouthern 8s. 5d. a difference due wholly to the influence of\r\nmanufactures, which is still further proved by the fact that in\r\nLancashire in 1770 wages were below the average for England. In fact\r\nsince Young's time wages in the north had increased 66 per cent., in\r\nthe south only 14 per cent. In Berkshire and Wiltshire there had been\r\nno increase in that period, and in Suffolk an actual decrease. It is\r\nnot surprising to learn that in some southern counties wages were not\r\nsufficient for healthy sustenance, and the consequence was, that\r\nthere, the average amount of poor relief per head of population was\r\n8s. 8-1/2d., but in the north 4s. 7-3/4d., and the percentage of\r\npaupers was twice as great in the former as in the latter. This was\r\nmainly due to two causes: (1) the ratepayers of parishes in the south\r\nwere accustomed to divide among themselves the surplus labour, not\r\naccording to their requirements but in proportion to the size of their\r\nfarms, so that a farmer who was a good economist of labour was reduced\r\nby this system to the same level as his unskilful neighbours, and the\r\nlabourer himself had no motive to do his best, as every one, good and\r\nbad, was employed at the same rate. (2) To the system of close and\r\nopen parishes, by which large proprietors could drive the labourer\r\nfrom the parish where he worked to live in some distant village in\r\ncase he should become chargeable to the rates, so that it was a common\r\nthing to see labourers walking three or four miles each day to their\r\nwork and back, and in one county farmers provided donkeys for them.\r\nBetween 1840 and 1850 the labourer had, however, already benefited by\r\nfree trade, for the price of many articles he consumed fell 30%; on\r\nthe other hand the rent of his cottage in eighty years had increased\r\n100%, and meat 70%, which however did not, unfortunately, affect him\r\nmuch. The great development of railway construction also helped him by\r\nabsorbing much surplus labour, and the work of his wife and children\r\nwas more freely exploited at this date to swell the family\r\nbudget.[644]\r\n\r\nThe great difference between the wages of the north and the south is\r\na clear proof that the wages of the agricultural labourer are not\r\ndependent on the prices of agricultural produce, for those were the\r\nsame in both regions. It was unmistakably due to the greater demand\r\nfor labour in the north.\r\n\r\nThe housing of the labourer was, especially in the south, often a\r\nblack blot on English civilization. From many instances collected by\r\nan inquirer in 1844 the following may be taken. At Stourpaine in\r\nDorset, one bedroom in a cottage contained three beds occupied by\r\neleven people of all ages and both sexes, with no curtain or partition\r\nwhatever. At Milton Abbas, on the average of the last census there\r\nwere thirty-six persons in each house, and so crowded were they that\r\ncottagers with a desire for decency would combine and place all the\r\nmales in one cottage, and all the females in another. But this was\r\nrare, and licentiousness and immorality of the worst kind were\r\nfrequent.[645]\r\n\r\nAs for the farmer, the stock raiser was doing better than the corn\r\ngrower. The following table shows the rent of cultivated land per\r\nacre, the produce of wheat per acre in bushels, the price of\r\nprovisions, wages of labour, and rent of cottages in England at the\r\ndate of Young's tours, about 1770, and of Caird's in 1850[647]:\r\n\r\n             Rent of           Produce of\r\n          cultivated land        Wheat            Price per lb. of\r\n            per acre.          per acre.      Bread.   Meat.   Butter.\r\n\r\n  1770    13s.  4d.            23            1-1/2d.  3-1/4d.    6d.\r\n  1850    26s. 10d.            26-3/4[646]   1-1/4d.  5d.        1s.\r\n\r\n              Price of Wool   Cottage          Labourer's wages\r\n              per lb.         rents.             per week.\r\n\r\n  1770         5-1/2d.        34s. 8d.           7s. 3d.\r\n  1850           1s.          74s. 6d.           9s. 7d.\r\n\r\nThus in eighty years the average rent of arable land rose 100%, the\r\naverage wheat crop 14%, while the price of bread had decreased 16%.\r\nBut meat had increased 70%, wool over 100%, butter 100%. The chief\r\nbenefit to the farmer therefore lay in the increased value of live\r\nstock and its products, and it was found then, as in the present\r\ndepression, that the holders of strong wheat land suffered most, which\r\nwas further illustrated by the fact that the rent of the corn-growing\r\ncounties of the east coast averaged 23s. 8d. per acre; that of the\r\nmixed corn and grass counties in the midlands and west, 31s. 5d.\r\n\r\nWriting in 1847, Porter said rents had doubled since 1790.[648] In\r\nEssex farms could be pointed out which were let in 1790 at less than\r\n10s. an acre, but during the war at from 45s. to 50s. In 1818 the rent\r\nwent down to 35s., and in 1847 was 20s.\r\n\r\nIn Berks. and Wilts. farms let at 14s. per acre in 1790, rose by 1810\r\nto 70s., or fivefold; sank in 1820 to 50s., and in 1847 to 30s. In\r\nStaffordshire farms on one estate let for 8s. an acre in 1790, rose\r\nduring the war to 35s., and at the peace were lowered to 20s., at\r\nwhich price they remained. Owing to better farming light soils had\r\nbeen applied to uses for which heavy lands alone had formerly been\r\nconsidered fit, with a considerable increase of rent.\r\n\r\nOn the Duke of Rutland's[649] Belvoir estate, of from 18,000 to 20,000\r\nacres of above average quality, rents were in--\r\n\r\n  1799           19s. 3-3/4d. an acre.\r\n  1812           25s. 8-3/4d.    \"\r\n  1830           25s. 1-3/4d.    \"\r\n  1850           36s. 8d.        \"\r\n\r\nBut the Dukes of Rutland were indulgent landlords and evidently took\r\nno undue advantage of the high prices during the war, a policy whose\r\nwisdom was fully justified afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of most competent judges, even after the abolition\r\nof the Corn Laws, that English land would continue to rise in value.\r\nPorter stated that the United Kingdom could never be habitually\r\ndependent on the soil of other countries for the food of its people,\r\nthere was not enough shipping to transport it if it could.[650]\r\n\r\nCaird prophesied that in the next eighty years the value of land in\r\nEngland would more than double. The wellnigh universal opinion was\r\nthat as the land of England could not increase, and the population was\r\nconstantly increasing, land must become dearer. Men failed to foresee\r\nthe opening of millions of acres of virgin soil in other parts of the\r\nworld, and the improvement of transport to such an extent that wheat\r\nhas occasionally been carried as ballast. About twenty-five or thirty\r\nyears after these prophecies their fallacy began to be cruelly\r\nexposed.[651]\r\n\r\nAbout 1853[652] matters began to mend, chiefly owing to the great\r\nexpansion in trade that followed the great gold discoveries in America\r\nand Australia. Then, came the Crimean War, with the closing of the\r\nBaltic to the export of Russian corn, wheat in 1855 averaging 74s.\r\n8d., and in the next decade the American War crippled another\r\ncompetitor, the imports of wheat from the United States sinking from\r\n16,140,000 cwt in 1862, to 635,000 cwt. in 1866. From 1853 until 1875\r\nEnglish agriculture prospered exceedingly, assisted largely by good\r\nseasons. Between 1854 and 1865 there were ten good harvests, and only\r\ntwo below the average. Prices of produce rose almost continuously, and\r\nthe price and rent of land with them. The trade of the country was\r\ngood, and the demand for the farmer's products steadily grew; the\r\ncapital value of the land, live stock, and crops upon it, increased in\r\nthis period by £445,000,000.[653]\r\n\r\nIt appeared as if the abolition of the Corn Laws was not to have any\r\ngreat effect after all.\r\n\r\nNow at last the great body of farmers began to approach the standard\r\nset them long before by the more energetic and enterprising. Early\r\nmaturity in finishing live stock for the market by scientific feeding\r\nprobably added a fourth to their weight The produce of crops per acre\r\ngrew, and drainage and improvements were carried out on all sides, the\r\ngreatest improvement being made in the cultivation and management of\r\nstrong lands, of which drainage was the foundation, and enabled the\r\noccupier to add swedes to his course of cropping.[654]\r\n\r\nIt was in this period that Shorthorns, Herefords, and Devons attained\r\na standard of excellence which has made them sought after by the whole\r\nworld; and other breeds were perfected, the Sussex and Aberdeen Angus\r\nespecially; while in sheep the improvement was perhaps even\r\ngreater.[655] The improved Lincolns, Oxford Downs, Hampshire Downs,\r\nand Shropshires took their place as standard breeds at this period. In\r\n1866, after many years of expectation and disappointment,\r\nagriculturists were furnished with statistics which are trustworthy\r\nfor practical purpose, but are somewhat vitiated by the fact that the\r\nlive stock census was taken on March 5, which obviously omitted a\r\nlarge number of young stock; so that those for 1867, when the census\r\nwas taken on June 25, are better for purposes of comparison with those\r\nof subsequent years, when the census has been taken on June 4 or 5.\r\nBetween 1867 and 1878 the cattle in England and Wales had increased\r\nfrom 4,013,564 to 4,642,641, though sheep had diminished from\r\n22,025,498 to 21,369,810.[656] The total acreage under cultivation had\r\nincreased from 25,451,526 acres to 27,164,326 acres in the same\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one black shadow in this fair picture: in 1865\r\nEngland was invaded by the rinderpest, which spread with alarming\r\nrapidity, killing 2,000 cows in a month from its first appearance, and\r\nwithin six months infecting thirty-six counties.[657] The alarm was\r\ngeneral, and town and country meetings were held in the various\r\ndistricts where the disease appeared to concert measures of defence.\r\nThe Privy Council issued an order empowering Justices to appoint\r\ninspectors authorized to seize and slaughter any animal labouring\r\nunder such diseases; but, in spite of this, the plague raged with\r\nredoubled fury throughout September. There was gross mismanagement in\r\ncombating it, for the inspectors were often ignorant men, and no\r\ncompensation was paid for slaughter, so that farmers often sold off\r\nmost of their diseased stock before hoisting the black flag. The\r\nravages of the disease in the London cow-houses was fearful, as might\r\nbe expected, and they are said to have been left empty; by no means an\r\nunmixed evil, as the keeping of cow-houses in towns was a glaring\r\ndefiance of the most obvious sanitary laws. In October a Commission\r\nwas appointed to investigate the origin and nature of the disease, and\r\nthe first return showed a total of 17,673 animals attacked. By March\r\n9, 1866, 117,664 animals had died from the plague, and 26,135 been\r\nkilled in the attempt to stay it. By the end of August the disease had\r\nbeen brought within very narrow limits, and was eventually stamped out\r\nby the resolute slaughter of all infected animals. By November 24 the\r\nnumber of diseased animals that had died or been killed was\r\n209,332,[658] and the loss to the nation was reckoned at £3,000,000.\r\nThe disease was brought by animals exported from Russia, who came from\r\nRevel, via the Baltic, to Hull. In 1872, cattle brought to the same\r\nport infected the cattle of the East Riding of Yorkshire, but this\r\noutbreak was checked before much damage had been done, and since 1877\r\nthere has been no trace of this dreaded disease in the kingdom. The\r\ncattle plague, rinderpest, or steppe murrain, is said[659] to have\r\nfirst appeared in England in 1665, the year of the Great Plague, and\r\nreappeared in 1714, when it came from Holland, but did little damage,\r\nbeing chiefly confined to the neighbourhood of London. The next\r\noutbreak was in 1745, and lasted for twelve years, undoubtedly coming\r\nfrom Holland; it is said to have caused such destruction among the\r\ncattle, that much of the grass land in England was ploughed up and\r\nplanted with corn, so that the exports of grain increased largely. In\r\n1769 it came again, but only affected a few localities, and\r\ndisappeared in 1771, not to return till 1865.\r\n\r\nFoot and mouth disease was first observed in England in 1839,[660]\r\nand it was malignant in 1840-1, when cattle, sheep, and pigs were\r\nattacked as they were during the serious outbreak of 1871-2. In 1883\r\nno less than 219,289 cattle were attacked, besides 217,492 sheep, and\r\n24,332 pigs, when the disease was worse than it has ever been in\r\nEngland. Since then, though there have been occasional outbreaks, it\r\nhas much abated. Another dread scourge of cattle, pleuro-pneumonia,\r\nwas at its worst in 1872, a most calamitous year in this respect, when\r\n7,983 cattle were attacked. In 1890 the Board of Agriculture assumed\r\npowers with respect to it under the Diseases of Animals Act of that\r\nyear, and their consequent action has been attended with great success\r\nin getting rid of the disease.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this halcyon period farmers had to contend with a new\r\ndifficulty, the demand for higher wages by their labourers at the\r\ninstigation of Joseph Arch.[661] This famous agitator was born at\r\nBarford in Warwickshire in 1826, and as a boy worked for neighbouring\r\nfarmers, educating himself in his spare time. The miserable state of\r\nthe labourer which he saw all around him entered into his soul, meat\r\nwas rarely seen on his table, even bacon was a luxury in many\r\ncottages. Tea was 6s. to 7s. a lb., sugar 8d., and other prices in\r\nproportion; the labourers stole turnips for food, and every other man\r\nwas a poacher. Arch made himself master of everything he undertook,\r\nbecame famous as a hedger, mower, and ploughman, and being\r\nconsequently employed all over the Midlands and South Wales, began to\r\ngauge the discontent of the labourer who was then voiceless, voteless,\r\nand hopeless. His wages by 1872 had increased to 12s. a week, but had\r\nnot kept pace with the rise in prices. Bread was 7-1/2d. a loaf; the\r\nlabourer had lost the benefit of his children's labour, for they had\r\nnow all gone to school; his food was 'usually potatoes, dry bread,\r\ngreens, herbs, \"kettle broth\" made by putting bread in the kettle,\r\nweak tea, bacon sometimes, fresh meat hardly ever.'[662] It is\r\ndifficult to realize that at the end of the third quarter of the\r\nnineteenth century, when Gladstone said the prosperity of the country\r\nwas advancing 'by leaps and bounds', that any class of the community\r\n_in full work_ could live under such wretched conditions. Arch came to\r\nthe conclusion that labour could only improve its position when\r\norganized, and the Agricultural Labourers' Union was initiated in\r\n1872. Not that the idea of obtaining better conditions by combination\r\nwas new to the rural labourer. It was attempted in 1832 in Dorset, but\r\nspeedily crushed, and not till 1865 was a new union founded in\r\nScotland, which was followed by a strike in Buckinghamshire in 1867,\r\nand the foundation of a union in Herefordshire in 1871.[663] It was\r\ndetermined to ask for 16s. a week and a 9-1/2 hours' working day,\r\nwhich the farmers refused to grant, and the men struck. The agitation\r\nspread all over England, and was often conducted unwisely and with a\r\nbitter spirit, but the labourer was embittered by generations of\r\nsordid misery. Very reluctantly the farmers gave way, and generally\r\nspeaking wages went up during the agitation to 14s. or 15s. a week,\r\nthough Arch himself admits that even during the height of it they were\r\noften only 11s. and 12s. With the bad times, about 1879, wages began\r\nto fall again, and men were leaving the Agricultural Union; by 1882\r\nArch says many were again taking what the farmer chose to give. From\r\n1884 the Union steadily declined, and after a temporary revival about\r\n1890, practically collapsed in 1894. Other unions had been started,\r\nbut were then going down hill, and in 1906 only two remained in a\r\nmoribund condition. Their main object, to raise the labourer's wages,\r\nwas largely counteracted by the acute depression in agriculture, and\r\nthough there has since been considerable recovery, there are districts\r\nin England to-day where he only gets 11s. and 12s. a week.\r\n\r\nThe Labourers' Union helped to deal a severe blow to the 'gang\r\nsystem', which had grown up at the beginning of the century (when the\r\nhigh corn prices led to the breaking up of land where there were no\r\nlabourers, so that 'gangs' were collected to cultivate it[664]), by\r\nwhich overseers, often coarse bullies, employed and sweated gangs\r\nsometimes numbering 60 or 70 persons, including small children, and\r\nwomen, the latter frequently very bad specimens of their sex. These\r\ngangs went turnip-singling, bean-dropping, weeding &c., while\r\npea-picking gangs ran to 400 or 500. Though some of these gangs were\r\nproperly managed, the system was a bad one, and the Union and the\r\nEducation Acts helped its disappearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[613] Cylindrical pipes came in about 1843, though they had been\r\nrecommended in 1727 by Switzer.\r\n\r\n[614] _R.A.S.E.

The full force of\r\nfree trade was at last felt. The seasons assisted the decline, and\r\nthere was now no compensation in the shape of higher prices. In the\r\neight years between 1874 and 1882 there were only two good crops. A\r\nnew and formidable competitor had entered the field; between 1860 and\r\n1880 the produce of wheat in the United States had trebled. Vast\r\nstretches of virgin soil were opened up with the most astonishing\r\nrapidity by railroads, and European immigrants poured in. The cost of\r\ntransport fell greatly, and England was flooded with foreign corn and\r\nmeat. English land which had to support the landlord, the tithe-owner,\r\nthe land agent, the farmer, the labourer, and a large army of\r\npaupers,[665] had to compete with land where often one man was owner,\r\nfarmer, and labourer, with no tithe and no poor rates. Yet prices held\r\nup fairly well until 1884, when there was a collapse from which they\r\nhave not yet recovered. In 1877 wheat was 56s. 9d., in 1883 41s. 7d.,\r\nand in 1884 35s. 8d.; by 1894 the average price for the year was 22s.\r\n10d.[666]\r\n\r\nFarmers' capital was reduced from 30 to 50 per cent., and rents and\r\nthe purchase value of land in a similar proportion. Poor clays only\r\nfit for wheat and beans went out of cultivation, though much has since\r\nbeen laid down to grass, and much has 'tumbled down'. In fact most of\r\nthe increased value of the good period between 1853-75 disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe year 1879 will long be remembered as 'the Black Year'. It was the\r\nworst of a succession of wet seasons in the midland, western and\r\nsouthern counties of England, the average rainfall being one-fourth\r\nabove the average, and 1880 was little better. The land, saturated and\r\nchilled, produced coarser herbage, the finer grasses languished or\r\nwere destroyed, fodder and grain were imperfectly matured. Mould and\r\nergot were prevalent among plants, and flukes producing liver-rot\r\namong live stock, especially sheep. In 1879 in England and Wales\r\n3,000,000 sheep died or were sacrificed from rot,[667] by 1881\r\n5,000,000 had perished at an estimated loss of £10,000,000, and many,\r\nalas! were sent to market full of disease. Cattle also were infected,\r\nand hares, rabbits, and deer suffered. In some cases entire flocks of\r\nsheep disappeared. The disease was naturally worst on low-lying and\r\nill-drained pastures, but occurred even on the drier uplands hitherto\r\nperfectly free from liver-rot, carried thither no doubt by the\r\ndroppings of infected sheep, hares, and rabbits, and perhaps by the\r\nfeet of men and animals. Apart from medicine, concentrated dry food\r\ngiven systematically, the regular use of common salt, and of course\r\nremoval from low-lying and damp lands, were found the best\r\npreventives.\r\n\r\nBesides this great calamity, this year was distinguished by one of the\r\nworst harvests of the century, outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, of\r\npleuro-pneumonia, and a disastrous attack of foot-rot. The misfortunes\r\nof the landed interest produced a Commission in 1879 under the Duke of\r\nRichmond, which conducted a most laborious and comprehensive inquiry.\r\nTheir report, issued in 1882, stated that they were unanimously\r\nconvinced of the great intensity and extent of the distress that had\r\nfallen upon the agricultural community. Owner and occupier had alike\r\nbeen involved. Yet, though agricultural distress had prevailed over\r\nthe whole country, the degree had varied in different counties, and in\r\nsome cases in different parts of the same counties. Cheshire, for\r\ninstance, had not suffered to anything like the same extent as other\r\ncounties, nor was the depression so severe in Cumberland,\r\nWestmoreland, Northumberland, and parts of Yorkshire. The rainfall had\r\nbeen less in the northern counties. In the midlands, the eastern, and\r\nmost of the southern counties the distress was severe, in Essex the\r\nstate of agriculture was deplorable, but Kent, Devon, and Cornwall\r\nwere not hardly hit.[668]\r\n\r\nThe chief causes of the depression were said to be these:--\r\n\r\n  1. The succession of unfavourable seasons, causing crops\r\n     deficient in quantity and quality, and losses of live stock.\r\n\r\n  2. Low prices, partly due to foreign imports and partly to\r\n     the inferior quality of the home production.\r\n\r\n  3. Increased cost of production.\r\n\r\n  4. Increased pressure of local taxation by the imposition\r\n     of new rates, viz. the education rate and the sanitary rate;\r\n     and the increase of old rates, especially the highway rate, in\r\n     consequence of the abolition of turnpikes. Some exceptionally\r\n     bad instances of this were given. In the parish of\r\n     Didmarton, Gloucestershire, the average amount of rates paid\r\n     for the five years ending March 31, 1858, was £26 6s. 3d.,\r\n     for the five years ending March 31, 1878, £118 11s. 7d. In\r\n     the Northleach Union the rates had increased thus in decennial\r\n     periods from 1850:--\r\n\r\n         1850-1     £5,471\r\n         1860-1      5,534\r\n         1870-1      8,525\r\n         1878-9     10,089\r\n\r\n     On one small property in Staffordshire the increase of rates,\r\n     other than poor rates, amounted to 3s. 6d. in the £ on the\r\n     rateable value.\r\n\r\n  5. Excessive rates charged by railway companies for the\r\n     conveyance of produce, and preferential rates given to foreign\r\n     agricultural produce; the railway companies alleging, in defence\r\n     of this, that foreign produce was consigned in much greater\r\n     bulk, by few consignors, than home grown, and could be conveyed\r\n     much more economically than if picked up at different\r\n     stations in small quantities.\r\n\r\nAs to the effect of restrictive covenants on the depression, the\r\nbalance of evidence did not incline either way.[669]\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural Holdings Act of 1875 was stated to have done much\r\ngood in the matter of compensation to tenants for improvements,\r\nnotwithstanding its merely permissive character, as it had reversed\r\nthe presumption of law in relation to improvements effected by the\r\ntenant, prescribed the amount of compensation, and the mode in which\r\nit should be given.\r\n\r\nAs to the important subject of freedom of cropping and sale of\r\nproduce, there were diverse opinions, some advocating it wholly,\r\nothers not believing in it at all, others saying each landlord and\r\neach tenant should make their own bargains since each farm stands on\r\nits own footing, others again favouring modified restrictions. The\r\npreponderance of opinion was in favour of a modification of the law of\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\nThe Commission further said that the pressure of foreign competition\r\nwas greatly in excess of the anticipations of the supporters and of\r\nthe apprehensions of the opponents of Corn Law Repeal; if it had not\r\nbeen for this, English farmers would have been partly compensated for\r\nthe deficient yield by higher prices. On the other hand, the farmer\r\nhad had the advantage of an increased and cheapened supply of feeding\r\nstuffs, such as maize, linseed and cotton cakes, and of artificial\r\nmanures imported from abroad. At the same time the benefit to the\r\ncommunity from cheap food was immense. It seemed just, however, that\r\nas agriculture was suffering from low prices, by which the country\r\ngained as a whole, that the proportion of taxation imposed on the land\r\nshould be lessened; it was especially unjust that personal property\r\nwas exempted from local rates, contrary to the Act of 43 Eliz. c. 2,\r\nand the whole burden thrown on real property. The difficulties of\r\nfarmers were aggravated by the high price of labour, which had\r\nincreased 25 per cent. in twenty years, largely owing to the\r\ncompetition of other industries, and at the same time become less\r\nefficient. As provisions were cheap, and employment abundant, the\r\nlabourer had been scarcely affected by the distress. His cottage,\r\nhowever, especially if in the hands of a small owner, with neither the\r\nmeans nor the will to expend money on improvements, was often still\r\nvery defective.\r\n\r\nFarmers were already complaining of the results of the new system of\r\neducation, for which they had to pay, while it deprived them of the\r\nlabour of boys, and drained from the land the sources of future labour\r\nby making the young discontented with farm work. The Commission denied\r\nthat rents had been unduly raised previous to 1875[670]; and in the\r\nexceptional cases where they had been, it was due to the imprudent\r\ncompetition of tenant farmers encouraged by advances made by country\r\nbankers, the sudden withdrawal of which had greatly contributed to the\r\npresent distress. Districts where dairying was carried on had suffered\r\nleast, yet the yield of milk was much diminished, and the quality\r\ndeteriorated, owing to the inferiority of grass from a continuance of\r\nwet seasons. The production and sale of milk was increasing largely,\r\nso that the attention of farmers and landlords was being drawn to this\r\nimportant branch of farming, milk-sellers necessarily suffering less\r\nfrom foreign competition than any other farmers.\r\n\r\nLet us turn once more to the hop yards: in 1878 the acreage of hops in\r\nEngland reached its maximum. We have seen that in the first half of\r\nthe eighteenth century hop yards covered 12,000 acres; which between\r\n1750 and 1780 increased to 25,000, and by 1800 to 32,000. In 1878,\r\n71,789 acres were grown. The great increase prior to that year was due\r\nto the abolition of the excise duty in 1862, which on an average was\r\nequal to an annual charge of nearly £7 an acre.[671] This encouraged\r\nhop-growing more than the taking off of the import duty in the same\r\nyear discouraged it. In 1882 there was a very small crop in England,\r\nwhich raised the average price to £18 10s. a cwt.; some choice samples\r\nfetching £30 a cwt.; growers who had good crops realizing much more\r\nthan the freehold value of the hop yards. This, however, was most\r\nunfortunate for them, as it led to a great increase in the use of hop\r\nsubstitutes, such as quassia, chiretta, colombo, gentian, &c., which,\r\nwith the decreasing consumption of beer and the demand for lighter\r\nbeer, has done more than foreign competition to lower the price and\r\nthereby cause so large an area to be grubbed up as unprofitable, that\r\nin 1907 it was reduced to 44,938 acres. Yet the quality of the hops\r\nhas in the last generation greatly improved in condition, quality, and\r\nappearance. Growers also have in the same period often incurred great\r\nexpense in substituting various methods of wire-work for poles; and\r\nwashing, generally with quassia chips and soft soap and water, has\r\nbecome wellnigh universal, so that the expense of growing the crop has\r\nincreased, while the price has been falling.[672] The crop has always\r\nbeen an expensive one to grow; Marshall in 1798 put it at £20 an acre,\r\nexclusive of picking, drying, and marketing[673]; and Young estimated\r\nthe total cost at the same date at £31 10s. an acre[674]; to-day £40\r\nan acre is by no means an outside price. It may be some encouragement\r\nto growers to remember that hops have always been subject to great\r\nfluctuations in price; between 1693 and 1700, for instance, they\r\nvaried from 40s. to 240s. a cwt., so that they may yet see them at a\r\nremunerative figure. 'Upon the whole', says an eighteenth-century\r\nwriter, 'though many have acquired large estates by hops, their real\r\nadvantage is perhaps questionable. By engrossing the attention of the\r\nfarmer they withdraw him from slower and more certain sources of\r\nwealth, and encourage him to rely too much upon chance for his rent,\r\nrather than the honest labour of the plough. To the landlord the\r\ncultivation of hops is an evil, defrauding the arable land of its\r\nproper quantity of manure and thereby impoverishing his estate.'\r\n\r\nIt was by this time the general opinion of men with a thorough\r\nexperience of farming, that in many parts of Great Britain no\r\nsufficient compensation was secured to the tenant for his unexhausted\r\nimprovements. In some counties and districts this compensation was\r\ngiven by established customs, in others customs existed which were\r\ninsufficient, in many they did not exist at all. It must be confessed\r\nthat often when a tenant leaves his farm there is more compensation\r\ndue to the landlord than to the tenant. Human nature being what it is,\r\nthe temptation to get as much out of the land just before leaving it\r\nis wellnigh irresistible to many farmers.\r\n\r\nIn these days, when the landlord is often called upon by the tenant to\r\ndo what the tenant used to do himself, the question of compensation to\r\nthe tenant must on many estates appear to the landlord extremely\r\nironical. It is, in the greater number of cases, the landlord who\r\nshould receive compensation, and not the tenant; and though he has\r\npower to demand it, such power is over and over again not put in\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nAt the same time there are bad men in the landlord class as in any\r\nother, and from them the tenant required protection. By the\r\nAgricultural Holdings (England) Act of 1875, 38 & 39 Vict. c. 92,\r\nimprovements for which compensation could be claimed by the tenant\r\nwere divided into three classes. First class improvements, such as\r\ndrainage of land, erection or enlargement of buildings, laying down of\r\npermanent pasture, &c., required the previous consent in writing of\r\nthe landlord to entitle the tenant to compensation. Second class\r\nimprovements, such as boning of land with undissolved bones, chalking,\r\nclaying, liming, and marling the land, the latter now hardly ever\r\npractised, required notice in writing by the tenant to the landlord of\r\nhis intention, and if notice to quit had been given or received, the\r\nconsent in writing of the landlord was necessary. For third class\r\nimprovements, such as the application to the land of purchased manure,\r\nand consumption on the holding by cattle, sheep, or pigs, of cake or\r\nother feeding stuff not produced on the holding, no consent or notice\r\nwas required. Improvements in the first class were deemed to be\r\nexhausted in twenty years, in the second in seven, and in the third in\r\ntwo. It was the opinion of the Richmond Commission of 1879 that,\r\nnotwithstanding the beneficial effects of this Act, no sufficient\r\ncompensation for his unexhausted improvements was secured to the\r\ntenant.\r\n\r\nThe landlord and tenant also might agree in writing that the Act\r\nshould not apply to their contract of tenancy, so in 1883 when the\r\nAgricultural Holdings Act of that year (46 & 47 Vict. c. 61)[675] was\r\npassed, it was made compulsory as far as regarded compensation, and\r\nthe time limit as regards the tenant's claims for improvements was\r\nabolished, the basis for compensation for all improvements recognized\r\nby the Act being laid down as 'the value of the improvement to an\r\nincoming tenant'. Improvements for which compensation could be claimed\r\nwere again divided into three classes as before, but the drainage of\r\nland was placed in the second class instead of the first, and so only\r\nrequired notice to the landlord. This was the only improvement in the\r\nsecond class; the other improvements which had been in the second\r\nclass in the Act of 1875 were now placed in the third, where no\r\nconsent or notice was required.\r\n\r\nThe Act also effected three other important alterations in the law;\r\nfirst, as to 'Notices to Quit', a year's notice being necessary where\r\nhalf a year's notice had been sufficient, though this section might be\r\nexcluded by agreement; secondly, after January 1, 1885, the landlord\r\ncould only distrain for one year's rent instead of six years as\r\nformerly; and thirdly, as to fixtures. These formerly became the\r\nproperty of the landlord on the determination of the tenancy, but by\r\n14 & 15 Vict. c. 25 an agricultural tenant was enabled to remove\r\nfixtures put up by him with the consent of his landlord for\r\nagricultural purposes. Now all fixtures erected after the commencement\r\nof the Act were the property of and removable by the tenant, but the\r\nlandlord might elect to purchase them.\r\n\r\nThis Act was amended by the Act of 1900 (63 & 64 Vict. 50), and has\r\nbeen much altered by the Agricultural Holdings Act of 1906 (6 Edw.\r\nVII, c. 56), which has treated the landlord with a degree of severity,\r\nwhich considering the excellent relations that have for the most part\r\nexisted between English landlords and tenants for generations, is\r\nutterly unwarranted. In several respects indeed he has been treated by\r\nthe Act as if the land did not belong to him, while freedom of\r\ncontract, until recent years one of the most cherished principles of\r\nour law, is arbitrarily interfered with. The chief alterations made by\r\nthe Act of 1906 were:--\r\n\r\n1. _Improvements._--By the Act of 1883, in the valuation for\r\nimprovements under the first schedule, such part of the improvement as\r\nis justly due to the inherent capabilities of the soil was not\r\ncredited to the tenant This provision is repealed by the Act of 1906,\r\nin reference to which it must be said that the latent fertility of the\r\nsoil, sometimes very considerable, may be developed by a small outlay\r\non the part of the tenant for which outlay he is certainly entitled to\r\ncompensation. But the greater part of the improvement may be due to\r\nthe soil which belongs to the landlord, yet the Act credits the tenant\r\nwith the whole of this improvement. An addition is made to the list of\r\nimprovements which a tenant may make without his landlord's consent\r\nand for which he is entitled on quitting to compensation, viz. repairs\r\nto buildings, being buildings necessary for the proper working of the\r\nholding, other than repairs which the tenant is obliged to execute.\r\n\r\n2. _Damage by Game._ A tenant may now claim compensation for damage to\r\ncrops by deer, pheasants, partridges, grouse, and black game.\r\n\r\n3. _Freedom of Cropping and Disposal of Produce._ Prior to this Act it\r\nhad been the custom for generations to insert covenants in agreements\r\nproviding for the proper cultivation of the farm; as, for instance,\r\nforbidding the removal from the holding of hay, straw, roots, green\r\ncrops, and manure made on the farm. These and other covenants were\r\nmerely in the interests of good farming, and to prevent the soil\r\ndeteriorating. In recent times vexatious covenants formerly inserted\r\nhad practically disappeared, and where still existing were seldom\r\nenforced. By this Act, notwithstanding any custom of the country or\r\nany contract or agreement, the tenant may follow any system of\r\ncropping, and dispose of any of his produce as he pleases, but after\r\nso doing he must make suitable and adequate provision to protect the\r\nfarm from injury thereby: a proviso vague and difficult to enforce,\r\nand not sufficient to prevent an unscrupulous tenant greatly injuring\r\nhis farm.\r\n\r\n4. _Compensation for unreasonable disturbance._ If a landlord without\r\ngood cause, and for reasons inconsistent with good estate management,\r\nterminates a tenancy by notice to quit; or refuses to grant a renewal\r\nof the tenancy if so requested at least one year before the expiration\r\nthereof; or if a tenant quits his holding in consequence of a demand\r\nby the landlord for an increased rent, such demand being due to an\r\nincreased value in the holding owing to improvements done by the\r\ntenant; in either of such events the tenant is entitled to\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\nThis compensation for disturbance is in direct opposition to the\r\nrecommendation of the Commission of 1894,[676] and seems to be an\r\nunwarrantable interference with the owner's management of his own\r\nland.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit, and one long needed, was conferred on farmers by the\r\nGround Game Act of 1880, 43 & 44 Vict., c. 47. Before the Act the\r\ntenant had by common law the exclusive right to the game, including\r\nhares and rabbits, unless it was reserved to the landlord, which was\r\nusually the case. By this Act the right to kill ground game, which\r\noften worked terrible havoc in the tenant's crops, was rendered\r\ninseparable from the occupation of the land, though the owner may\r\nreserve to himself a concurrent right. One consequence of this Act has\r\nbeen that the hare has disappeared from many parts of England.\r\n\r\nThe greatest improvement in implements during this period was in the\r\ndirection of reaping and mowing machines, which have now attained a\r\nhigh degree of perfection. As early as 1780 the Society of Arts\r\noffered a gold medal for a reaping machine, but it was not till 1812\r\nthat John Common of Denwick, Northumberland, invented a machine which\r\nembodied all the essential principles of the modern reaper. Popular\r\nhostility to the machine was so great that Common made his early\r\ntrials by moonlight, and he ceased from working on them.[677] His\r\nmachine was improved by the Browns of Alnwick, who sold some numbers\r\nin 1822, and shortly afterwards emigrated to Canada taking with them\r\nmodels of Common's reapers. McCormick, the reputed inventor of the\r\nreaping machine, knew the Browns, and obtained from them a model of\r\nCommon's machine which was almost certainly the father of the famous\r\nmachine exhibited by him at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Various\r\nother inventors have assisted in improving this implement, and in 1873\r\nthe first wire binder was exhibited in Europe by the American, W.A.\r\nWood, wire soon giving place to string owing to the outcry of farmers\r\nand millers. The self-binding reaper is the most ingenious of\r\nagricultural machines, and has been of enormous benefit to farmers in\r\nsaving labour. Though the hay-tedding machine was invented in 1814 it\r\nis only during the last thirty years that its use has become common,\r\nthe spread of the mowing machine making it a necessity, cutting the\r\ngrass so fast that only a very large number of men with the old forks\r\ncould keep up with it. The tedder also rendered raking by hand too\r\nslow, and the horse-rake, patented first in 1841, has immensely\r\nimproved in the last thirty years.\r\n\r\nAnother enormous labour saver is the hay and straw elevator, having\r\nendless chains furnished with carrying forks at intervals of a few\r\nfeet, driven by horse gear. The steam cultivator invented by John\r\nFowler is much used, but cannot be said to have superseded the\r\nordinary working stock of the farm, though for deep ploughing on large\r\nfarms of heavy land it is invaluable. Improvements in dairying\r\nappliances have also been great, but the English farmer has generally\r\nfought shy of factories or creameries, so that his butter still lacks\r\nthe uniform quality of his foreign rivals.\r\n\r\nIn manures the most important innovation in the last generation has\r\nbeen the constantly growing use of basic slag, formerly left neglected\r\nat the pit mouth and now generally recognized as a wonderful producer\r\nof clover.\r\n\r\nMost of the suggestions of the Commission of 1879 were carried into\r\neffect. Rents were largely reduced, so that between 1880 and 1884 the\r\nannual value of agricultural land in England sank £5,750,000.[678]\r\nGrants were made by the Government in aid of local burdens, cottages\r\nwere improved although the landowners' capital was constantly\r\ndwindling, Settled Land Acts assisted the transfer of limited estates,\r\na Minister of Agriculture was appointed in 1889, and in 1891 the\r\npayment of the tithe was transferred from the tenant to the landlord,\r\nwhich generally meant that the whole burden was now borne by the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nStill foreign imports continued to pour in and prices to fall. Wheat\r\nland, which was subject to the fiercest competition, began to be\r\nconverted to other uses, and between 1878 and 1907 had fallen in\r\nEngland from 3,041,214 acres to 1,537,208, most of it being converted\r\nto pasture or 'tumbling down' to grass, while a large quantity was\r\nused for oats. The price of live stock was now falling greatly before\r\nincreasing imports of live animals and dead meat, while cheese,\r\nbutter, wool, and fruit were also pouring in. Farming, too, was now\r\nsuffering from a new enemy, gambling in farm produce, which began to\r\nshow itself about 1880 and has since materially contributed to\r\nlowering prices.[679] The enormous gold premium in the Argentine\r\nRepublic, with the steady fall in silver, was another factor. As Mr.\r\nProthero says, 'Enterprise gradually weakened, landlords lost their\r\nability to help, and farmers their recuperative power. The capital\r\nboth of landlords and tenants was so reduced that neither could afford\r\nto spend an unnecessary penny. Land deteriorated in condition,\r\ndrainage was practically discontinued ... less cake and less manure\r\nwere bought, labour bills were reduced, and the number of males\r\nemployed in farming dwindled as the wheat area contracted.'[680] The\r\nyear 1893 was remarkable for a prolonged drought in the spring; from\r\nMarch 2 to May 14 hardly any rain fell, and live stock were much\r\nreduced in quality from the parching of the herbage, while in many\r\nparts the difficulty of supplying them with water was immense.\r\n\r\nIn the same year another Commission on Agriculture was appointed,\r\nwhose description of the condition of agriculture was a lamentable\r\none. The Commission in their final report[681] stated that the seasons\r\nsince 1882 had on the whole been satisfactory from an agricultural\r\npoint of view, and the evidence brought forward showed that the\r\nexisting depression was to be mainly attributed to the fall in prices\r\nof farm produce. This fall had been most marked in the case of grain,\r\nparticularly wheat, and wool also had fallen heavily. It was not\r\nsurprising therefore to find that the arable counties[682] had\r\nsuffered most; in counties where dairying, market gardening, poultry\r\nfarming, and other special industries prevailed the distress was less\r\nacute, but no part of the country could be said to have escaped. In\r\nnorth Devon, noted for stock rearing, rents had only fallen 10 to 15\r\nper cent. since 1881, and in many cases there had been no reduction at\r\nall. In Herefordshire and Worcestershire good grass lands, hop lands,\r\nand dairy farms had maintained their rents in many instances, and the\r\nreductions had apparently seldom exceeded 15 per cent.; on the heavy\r\narable lands, however, the reduction was from 20 to 40 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn Cheshire, devoted mainly to dairying, there had been no general\r\nreduction of rent, though there had been remissions, and in some cases\r\nreductions, of 10 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn fact, grazing and dairy lands, which comprise so large an area of\r\nthe northern and western counties, were not badly affected, though the\r\ndepreciation in the value of live stock and the fall in wool had\r\nconsiderably diminished farm profits and rents. But of the eastern\r\ncounties, those in which there are still large quantities of arable\r\nland, a different tale was told. In Essex much of the clay land was\r\ngoing out of cultivation; many farms, after lying derelict for a few\r\nyears, were let as grass runs for stock at a nominal rent The rent of\r\nan estate near Chelmsford of 1,418 acres had fallen from £1,314 in\r\n1879 to £415 in 1892, or from 18s. 6d. an acre to 5s. 10d.[683] The\r\nnet rental of another had fallen from £7,682 in 1881 to £2,224 in\r\n1892, and the landlord's income from his estate of 13,009 acres in\r\n1892-3 was 1s. an acre. The balance sheet of the estate for the same\r\nyear is an eloquent example of the landowner's profits in these\r\ndepressed times[684]:\r\n\r\n  11:12 AM 7/25/2005RECEIPTS.\r\n                                      £    s.  d.\r\n\r\n  Tithe received                     798   5   9\r\n  Cottage rents                      495   8   6\r\n  Garden    \"                        213   5  10\r\n  Estate    \"                      7,452  14   8\r\n  Tithes refunded by tenants         530  15   2\r\n                                  --------------\r\n                                  £9,490   9  11\r\n                                  ==============\r\n\r\n  PAYMENTS.\r\n                                      £    s.  d.\r\n\r\n  Tithe, rates and taxes           2,964   1   9\r\n  Rent-charge and fee farm rents     179   0   4\r\n  Gates and fencing                    8   7   8\r\n  Estate repairs and buildings     4,350  12   8\r\n  Draining                           170   6   1\r\n  Brickyard                          170   1   8\r\n  Management                         936  14   7\r\n  Insurances                          58  11   5\r\n  Balance profit                     652  13   9\r\n                                 ---------------\r\n                                  £9,490   9  11\r\n                                 ===============\r\n\r\nIn the great agricultural county of Lincoln rents had fallen from 30\r\nto 75 per cent.[685] The average amount realized on an acre of wheat\r\nhad fallen from £10 6s. 3d. in 1873-7 to £2 18s. 11d. in 1892[686];\r\nand the fall in the price of cattle between 1882 and 1893 was a little\r\nover 30 per cent. Many of the large farmers in Lincolnshire before\r\n1875 had lived in considerable comfort and even luxury, as became men\r\nwho had invested large sums, sometimes £20,000, in their business.\r\nThey had carriages, hunters, and servants, and gave their children an\r\nexcellent start in life. But all this was changed; a day's hunting\r\noccasionally was the utmost they could afford, and wives and daughters\r\ntook the work from the servants. The small farmers had suffered more\r\nthan the large ones, and the condition of the small freeholders was\r\nsaid to be deplorable; a fact to be noted by those who think small\r\nholdings a panacea for distress.[687]\r\n\r\nEven near Boston, where the soil is favourable for market gardening,\r\nthe evidence of the small holder was 'singularly unanimous' as to\r\ntheir unfortunate condition. The small occupiers were better off than\r\nthe freeholders, because their rents had been reduced and they could\r\nleave their farms if they did not pay; but their position was very\r\nunsatisfactory. From the evidence given to the assistant commissioner\r\nit is clear that the small occupier and freeholder could only get on\r\nby working harder and living harder than the labourer. 'We all live\r\nhard and never see fresh meat,' said one. 'We can't afford butcher's\r\nmeat,' said another. Another said, 'In the summer I work from 4 a.m.\r\nto 8 p.m., and often do not take more than an hour off for meals. That\r\nis penal servitude, except you have your liberty. A foreman who earns\r\n£1 a week is better off than I am. He has no anxiety, and not half the\r\nwork.' These instances could be multiplied many times, so that it is\r\nnot surprising that the children of these men have flocked to the\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\nIn Norfolk, 'twenty or thirty years ago, no class connected with the\r\nland held their heads higher' than the farmers. Many of them owned the\r\nwhole or a part of the land they farmed, and lived in good style. All\r\nthis was now largely changed. 'The typical Norfolk farmer of to-day is\r\na harassed and hardworking man,' engaged in the struggle to make both\r\nends meet. Many were ruined.\r\n\r\nHowever, there were farmers who, by skill, enterprise, and careful\r\nmanagement, made their business pay even in these times, such as the\r\ntenant of the farm at Papplewick in Nottinghamshire who gained the\r\nfirst prize in the Royal Agricultural Society's farm competition in\r\n1888.[688]. This farm consisted of 522 acres, of which only 61 were\r\ngrass, but chiefly owing to the trouble taken in growing fine root\r\ncrops, a large number of live stock were annually purchased and sold\r\noff, the following balance sheet showing a profit of £3 1s. 0d. per\r\nacre:\r\n\r\n                           DR.                            £\r\n\r\n  Rent, tithes, rates, taxes, &c.                        278\r\n  Wages                                                  387\r\n  Purchase of cake, corn, seeds, manure, &c.             688\r\n  Purchase of live stock                               2,654\r\n                                                       -----\r\n                                                      £4,007\r\n  Profit                                               1,589\r\n                                                      ------\r\n                                                      £5,596\r\n                                                      ======\r\n\r\n                            CR.                           £\r\n\r\n  Corn, hay, potatoes, and like product sold             655\r\n  Live stock, poultry, dairy produce, and wool sold    4,941\r\n                                                      ------\r\n                                                      £5,596\r\n                                                      ======\r\n\r\nThe reductions of rents in various counties were estimated thus[689]:\r\n\r\n                       Per cent.

Many, indeed, have\r\nbeen driven from their estates, while others can only live on them by\r\nletting the mansion house and the shooting, and occupying some small\r\nhouse on the lands they are reluctant to leave. The agricultural\r\ndepression, which set in about 1875, may in short be said to have\r\neffected a minor social revolution, and to have completed the ruin of\r\nthe old landed aristocracy as a class. The depreciation of their\r\nrents may be judged from the following figures[690]:\r\n\r\n  Gross annual value of lands, including\r\n  tithes, under Schedule A in England.             Decrease.\r\n\r\n       1879-80               1893-4            Amount.

Sir James Caird, as\r\nearly as 1886, estimated the average reduction on agricultural rents\r\nat 30 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe loss in the capital value of land has inevitably been great from\r\nthis reduction in rents, and has been aggravated by the fact that the\r\nconfidence of the public in agricultural land as an investment has\r\nbeen much shaken. In 1875 thirty years' purchase on the gross annual\r\nvalue of land was the capital value, in 1894 only eighteen years'\r\npurchase; and whereas the capital value of land in the United Kingdom\r\nwas in 1875 £2,007,330,000, in 1894 it was £1,001,829,212, a decrease\r\nof 49.6 per cent. Moreover, landlords have incurred increased\r\nexpenditure on repairs, drainage, and buildings, and taxation has\r\ngrown enormously. On the occupiers of land the effect of the\r\ndepression was no less serious, their profits having fallen on an\r\naverage 40 per cent.[691] Occupying owners had suffered as much as any\r\nother class, both yeomen who farmed considerable farms and small\r\nfreeholders. Many of the former had bought land in the good times when\r\nland was dear and left a large portion of the purchase money on\r\nmortgage, with the result that the interest on the mortgage was now\r\nmore than the rent of the land.[692]\r\n\r\nThey were thus worse off than the tenant farmer, for they paid a\r\nhigher rent in the shape of interest; moreover, they could not leave\r\ntheir land, for it could only be sold at a ruinous loss. The\r\n'statesmen' of Cumberland were weighed down by the same burdens and\r\ntheir disappearance furthered; for instance, in the parish of Abbey\r\nQuarter, between 1780 and 1812 their number decreased from 51 to 38.\r\nBy 1837 it was 30; by 1864, 21; and in 1894 only 9 remained.\r\n\r\nThe small freeholders were also largely burdened with mortgages, and\r\neven in the Isle of Axholme were said to have suffered more than any\r\nother class; largely because of their passion for acquiring land at\r\nhigh prices, leaving most of the purchase money on mortgage, and\r\nstarting with insufficient capital.\r\n\r\nAs regards the agricultural labourer, the chief effect of the\r\ndepression had been a reduction of the number employed and a\r\nconsequent decrease in the regularity of employment. [693]\r\n\r\nTheir material condition had everywhere improved, though there were\r\nstill striking differences in the wages paid in different parts; and\r\nthe improvement, though partly due to increased earnings, was mainly\r\nattributable to the cheapening of the necessaries of life.[694] The\r\ngreat majority of ordinary labourers were hired by the week, except\r\nthose boarded in the farm-house, who were generally hired by the year.\r\nMen, also, who looked after the live stock were hired by the year.\r\nWeekly wages ranged from 10s. in Wilts, and Dorset to 18s. in\r\nLancashire, and averaged 13s. 6d. for the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe fall in the prices of agricultural produce is best represented in\r\ntabular form:\r\n\r\n  TRIENNIAL AVERAGE OF BRITISH\r\n  WHEAT, BARLEY, AND OATS PER QUARTER.\r\n\r\n              Wheat.

Other home-grown cereals had not been similarly\r\ndisplaced, but the large consumption of maize had affected the price\r\nof feeding barley and oats. As regards meat, while foreign beef and\r\nmutton had seriously affected the price of inferior British grades,\r\nthe influence on superior qualities had been much less marked. Foreign\r\ncompetition had been, on the whole, perhaps more severe in pork than\r\nin other classes of meat, but had been confined mainly to bacon and\r\nhams.\r\n\r\nThe successful competition of the foreigner in our butter and cheese\r\nmarkets was attributed mainly to the fact that the dairy industry is\r\nbetter organized abroad than in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe Commission found that another cause of the depression was the\r\nincreased cost of production, not so much from the increase of wages,\r\nas from the smaller amount of work done for a given sum. Where wages\r\nin the previous twenty years had remained stationary, the cost of work\r\nhad increased because the labourer did not work so hard or so well as\r\nhis forefathers.\r\n\r\nThe following table[696] is a striking proof of the increased ratio of\r\nthe cost of labour to gross profits:\r\n\r\n                                                             Ratio of\r\n                                          Average             cost of\r\n        Acreage  Period      Average       annual   Average    labour\r\n             of      of        gross      cost of  cost per  to gross\r\n  County. farm.   acct.      profit.      labour.     acre.  profits.\r\n\r\n                           £   s. d.     £  s. d.    s.  d.

'The result of all our experiments,' he said,\r\n'is that the reverse is the case. As you increase your crops so each\r\nbushel after a certain amount costs you more and more ... the last\r\nbushel always costs you more than all the others.' As prices went\r\nlower 'we must contract our farming to what I should call the average\r\nof the seasons'; and in the corn districts, the higher the farmer had\r\nfarmed his land by adding manure the worse had been the financial\r\nresults.[697]\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the injustice of the incidence of rates on agricultural land\r\nwas partly remedied, the occupier being relieved of half the rates on\r\nthe land apart from the buildings, which Act was continued in\r\n1901.[698] But the system is still inequitable, for a farmer who pays\r\na rent of £240 a year even now probably pays more rates than the\r\noccupier of a house rated at £120 a year. Yet the farmer's income\r\nwould very likely not be more than £200 a year, whereas the occupier\r\nof the house rated at £120 might have an income of £2,000 a year.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 and 1902 Mr. Rider Haggard, following in the footsteps of\r\nYoung, Marshall, and Caird, made an agricultural tour through England.\r\nHe considered that, after foreign competition, the great danger to\r\nEnglish farming was the lack of labour,[699] for young men and women\r\nwere everywhere leaving the country for the towns, attracted by the\r\nnominally high wages, often delusive, and by the glamour of the\r\npavement. Yet the labourer has come better out of the depression of\r\nthe last generation than either landowner or farmer: he is better\r\nhoused, better fed, better clothed, better paid, but filled with\r\ndiscontent. Since Mr. Haggard wrote, however, there seems to be a\r\nreaction, small indeed but still marked, against the townward\r\nmovement, and in most places the supply of labour is sufficient. The\r\nquality, however, is almost universally described as inferior; the\r\nlabourer takes no pride in his work, and good hedgers, thatchers,\r\nmilkers, and men who understand live stock are hard to obtain[700];\r\nand the reason for this is in large measure due to the modern system\r\nof education which keeps a boy from farm work until he is too old to\r\ntake to it. His wages to-day in most parts are good; near\r\nmanufacturing towns the ordinary farm hand is paid from 18s. to 20s. a\r\nweek with extras in harvest, and in purely agricultural districts from\r\n13s. to 15s. a week, often with a cottage rent free at the lower\r\nfigure. His cottage has improved vastly, especially on large estates,\r\nthough often leaving much to be desired, and the rent usually paid is\r\n£4 or £5 a year, rising to £7 and £8 near large towns. The wise custom\r\nof giving him a garden has spread, and is nearly always found to be\r\nmuch more helpful than an allotment. The superior or more skilled\r\nworkmen,[701] such as the wagoner, stockman, or shepherd, earns in\r\nagricultural counties like Herefordshire from 14s. to 18s. a week, and\r\nin manufacturing counties like Lancashire from 20s. to 22s. a week,\r\nwith extras such as 3d. a lamb in lambing time. At the lower wages he\r\noften has a cottage and garden rent free.\r\n\r\nThe improved methods of cutting and harvesting crops have so enabled\r\nthe farmer to economize labour that the once familiar figure of the\r\nIrish labourer with his knee-breeches and tall hat, who came over for\r\nthe harvest, has almost disappeared. Women, who formerly shared with\r\nthe men most of the farm work, now are little seen in most parts of\r\nEngland at work in the fields, and are better occupied in attending to\r\ntheir homes.\r\n\r\nThe divorce of the labourer from the land by enclosure had early\r\nexercised men's minds, and many efforts were made to remedy this.\r\nAbout 1836 especially, several landowners in various parts of England\r\nintroduced allotments, and the movement spread rapidly, so that in\r\n1893 the Royal Commission on Labour stated that in most places the\r\nsupply was equal to or in excess of the demand.[702] However, previous\r\nAllotments and Small Holdings Acts not being considered so successful\r\nas was desired, in 1907 an effort was made to give more effect to the\r\ncry of 'back to the land' by a Small Holdings and Allotments Act[703]\r\nwhich enables County Councils to purchase land by agreement or take it\r\non lease, and, if unable to acquire it by agreement, to do so\r\ncompulsorily, in order to provide small holdings for persons desiring\r\nto lease them. The County Council may also arrange with any Borough\r\nCouncil or Urban District Council to act as its agent in providing and\r\nmanaging small holdings. The duty of supplying allotments rests in the\r\nfirst instance with the Rural Parish Councils, though if they do not\r\ntake proper steps to provide allotments, the County Council may itself\r\nprovide them.\r\n\r\nIt is a praiseworthy effort, though marked by arbitrary methods and\r\nthat contempt for the rights of property, provided it belongs to some\r\none else, that is a characteristic of to-day. That it will succeed\r\nwhere the small holder has some other trade, and in exceptionally\r\nfavoured situations, is very probable; most of the small holders who\r\nwere successful before the Act had something to fall back upon: they\r\nwere dealers, hawkers, butchers, small tradesmen, &c. There is no\r\ndoubt, too, that an allotment helps both the town artisan and the\r\ncountry labourer to tide over slack times. Whether it will succeed in\r\nplanting a rural population on English soil is another matter. It is a\r\nconsummation devoutly to be wished, for a country without a sound\r\nreserve of healthy country-people is bound to deteriorate. The small\r\nholder, pure and simple, without any by-industry, has hitherto only\r\nbeen able to keep his head above water by a life which without\r\nexaggeration may be called one of incessant toil and frequent\r\nprivation, such a life as the great mass of our 'febrile factory\r\nelement' could not endure. And if there is one tendency more marked\r\nthan another in the history of English agriculture, it is the\r\ndisappearance of the small holding. In the Middle Ages it is probable\r\nthat the average size of a man's farm was 30 acres, with its attendant\r\nwaste and wood; since then amalgamation has been almost constant.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the occupier of a few acres often brings to bear on it\r\nan amount of industry which is greater in proportion than that\r\nbestowed on a large farm; but the large farmer has, as Young pointed\r\nout long ago, very great advantages. He is nearly always a man of\r\nsuperior intelligence and training. He has more capital, and can buy\r\nand sell in the best markets; he can purchase better stock, and save\r\nlabour and the cost of production by using the best machinery. By\r\nbuying in large quantities he gets manures, cakes, seeds, &c., better\r\nand cheaper than the small holder.\r\n\r\nBesides the small holders who have outside industries to fall back\r\nupon, those who are aided by some exceptionally favourable element in\r\nthe soil or climate, or proximity to good markets, should do well. Yet\r\nin the Isle of Axholme, the paradise of small holders, we have seen\r\nthat the Commission of 1894 reported that distress was severe. This,\r\nhowever, seems to have been largely due to the exaggerated land-hunger\r\nin the good times, which induced the tenants to buy lands at too high\r\na price; and under normal conditions, such as they are now returning\r\nto, the tenants seem to thrive. In this district the preference for\r\nownership as opposed to tenancy is, in spite of recent experiences,\r\nunqualified, though it is admitted that the best way is to begin by\r\nrenting and save enough to buy.[704] The soil is peculiarly favourable\r\nto the production of celery and early potatoes; and large tracts of\r\nland are divided into unfenced strips locally known as 'selions' of\r\nfrom a quarter of an acre to 3 acres each, cultivated by men who live\r\nin the villages, each having one or more strips, some as much as 20\r\nacres, and it is considered that 10 acres is the smallest area on\r\nwhich a man can support a family without any other industry to help\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nYet in the fen districts and on the marsh lands between Boston and the\r\neast coast of Lincolnshire, where the land is naturally very\r\nproductive, many people are making livings out of 5 or 6 acres, mainly\r\nby celery and early potatoes.[705] Other districts adapted naturally\r\nto small holdings are those of Rock and Far Forest, the famous Vale of\r\nEvesham, the Sandy and Biggleswade district of Bedfordshire; Upwey,\r\nDorset; Calstock and St. Dominick, Cornwall; Wisbech, Cambridgeshire;\r\nand Tiptree, Essex. Apart, however, from by-industries, and\r\nexceptional climate, soil, and situation, the small holding for the\r\npurpose of raising corn and meat, as distinguished from that which is\r\ndevoted to dairying, fruit-growing, and market gardening, does not\r\nseem to-day to have much chance of success. If farms were still\r\nself-sufficing, and simply provided food and clothing for the farmer,\r\nthe small producer even of corn and meat might do as well as the\r\nlarger farmer on a lower scale, but such conditions have gone; all\r\nholdings now are chiefly manufactories of food, and the smaller\r\nmanufactory has little chance in competition with the greater.\r\n\r\nThe example of foreign countries is usually held up to Englishmen in\r\nthis connexion, and the argument naturally used is that 'if small\r\nholdings answer in France and Belgium, why can they not do so in\r\nEngland?' On this point the testimony of Sir John Lawes is worth\r\nquoting.[706] 'In most, if not in all continental countries' he says,\r\n'the success of small holdings depends very materially on whether or\r\nnot the soil and the climate are suitable for what may be called\r\nindustrial crops: such as tobacco, hops, sugar beet, colza, flax,\r\nhemp, grapes, and other fruit and vegetables; where these conditions\r\ndo not exist the condition of the cultivators is such _as would not be\r\ntolerated in this country_.' That is the reason probably why small\r\nholdings, apart from exceptional conditions, do not answer in England;\r\nthe Englishman of to-day is not anxious to face the hard and grinding\r\nconditions under which the continental small holder lives.\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Haggard's tour the black clouds which have so long lowered\r\nover agriculture have shown signs of lifting. Rents have been adjusted\r\nto a figure at which the farmer has some chance of competing with the\r\nforeigner,[707] though the price of grain keeps wretchedly low; stock\r\nhas improved, and there is undoubtedly to-day (1908) a brisker demand\r\nfor farms, and in some localities rents have even advanced slightly.\r\nThe yeoman--that is, the man who owns and farms his own land, perhaps\r\nthe most sound and independent class in the community--has,\r\nunfortunately for England, largely disappeared. Even of those who\r\nremain, some prefer to let their property and rent holdings from\r\nothers! It has been noticed that the labourer's lot has improved in\r\nthis generation of adversity; and well it might, for his previous\r\ncondition was miserable in the extreme. The farmers have suffered\r\nseverely, many losing all their capital and becoming farm labourers.\r\nThe landlords have suffered most; they have not been able to throw up\r\ntheir land like the farmer, and until quite recently have watched it\r\nbecoming poorer and poorer. The depression, in short, has driven from\r\ntheir estates many who had owned them for generations. Those who have\r\nsurvived have usually been men with incomes from other sources than\r\nland, and they have generally deserved well of their country by\r\nkeeping their estates in good condition in spite of falling rents and\r\nincreasing taxation.\r\n\r\nNo class of men, indeed, have been more virulently and consistently\r\nabused than the landlords of England, and none with less justice.\r\nThere have been many who have forgotten that property has its duties\r\nas well as its rights; they have erred like other men, but as a rule\r\nthey play their part well. Even the worst are to some extent obliged\r\nby their very position to be public spirited, for the mere possession\r\nof an estate involves the employment of a number of people in healthy\r\noutdoor occupations which Englishmen to-day so especially need to\r\ncounteract the degenerating influences of town life. Many of the great\r\nestates[708] are carried on at a positive loss to their owners, and it\r\nmay be doubted whether agricultural property pays the possessor a\r\nreturn of 2 per cent. per annum; which is as much as to say that the\r\nlandlord furnishes the tenant with capital in the form of land at that\r\nrate for the purpose of his business. What other class is content with\r\nsuch a scanty return? They are often charged with not managing their\r\nestates on business principles, and no charge is worse founded. It\r\nwould be a sad day for the tenants on many an estate if they were\r\nmanaged on commercial lines. One of the first results would be that\r\nmany properties would be given up as a dead loss. They could only be\r\nmade to pay by raising the rents or cutting down the ever-recurring\r\nexpenditure on repairs and buildings which are necessary for the\r\nwelfare of the tenants. The Duke of Bedford, in his _Story of a Great\r\nEstate_, has said that the rent has completely disappeared from three\r\nof his estates. On the Thorney and Woburn estates over £750,000 was\r\nspent on new works and permanent improvements alone between 1816 and\r\n1895, and the result, owing to agricultural depression and increased\r\nburdens on the land, was a net loss of £7,000 a year; and every one\r\nwith any knowledge of the management of land knows that this is no\r\nisolated case, though it may be on an exceptionally large scale. Where\r\nwould many tenants be if commercial principles ruled on rent audit\r\ndays? The larger English landlords of to-day are as a rule not\r\ndependent on their rent rolls. To their great advantage, and to the\r\nadvantage of their tenants, they generally own other property, so that\r\nthey need not regard the land as a commercial investment. They can\r\ntherefore support the necessary outlay on a large estate, the capital\r\nexpenditure on improvements of all kinds, and thus relieve the tenant\r\nof any expense of this kind. The farms are let at moderate, not rack\r\nrents, such as the tenants can easily pay. Also the landlord can make\r\nlarge reductions of rent in years of exceptional distress.[709] Rents\r\nare generally collected three months after they are due, a\r\nconsiderable concession; and even then arrears are numerous, for any\r\nreasonable excuse for being behind with the rent is generously\r\nlistened to. It is owing to forbearance in this and other matters that\r\nthe relations between landlord and tenant are generally excellent.\r\nWhere are the best farm buildings, where the best cottages, where does\r\nthe owner carry on a home farm often for the assistance of the tenant\r\nby letting him have the use of entire horses, well-bred bulls, and\r\nrams, if not on the larger estates? The restrictions in leases, so\r\nmuch decried of late years, were nearly always in the interest of good\r\nfarming, and their abolition will lead to the deterioration of many a\r\nholding.\r\n\r\nBacon said, 'Where men of great wealth do stoop to husbandry, it\r\nmultiplieth riches exceedingly' and wiser words were never uttered.\r\nYet these are the men who are singled out for attack by agitators, who\r\nare only listened to because the greater number of modern Englishmen\r\nare ignorant of the land and everything connected with it. At a time\r\nwhen rents have dwindled, in some cases almost to vanishing point,\r\ntaxation has increased, and confiscatory schemes and meddlesome\r\nrestrictions have frightened away capital from the land. Many of the\r\nlandlords of England would clearly gain by casting off the burden of\r\ntheir heavily weighted property, but they nearly all stick nobly to\r\ntheir duty, and hope for that restoration of confidence in the\r\nsanctity of property and of respect for freedom of contract which\r\nwould do so much towards the rehabilitation of what is still the\r\ngreatest and most important industry in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[665] And an ever increasing burden of taxation.\r\n\r\n[666] See Appendix III.\r\n\r\n[667] _R.A.S.E.

Down to 1846 Germany\r\nsupplied more than half the wheat that was imported into England,\r\nDenmark sent more than Russia, and the United States hardly any.\r\nOther competitors who have since arisen were then unknown. By the end\r\nof the next decade Russia and the United States sent large\r\nquantities, as may be gathered from the following table [710]:\r\n\r\n  ANNUAL AVERAGE IMPORTS OF WHEAT AND FLOUR FOR\r\n  THE SEVEN YEARS 1859-1865.\r\n                                                   Cwt.\r\n\r\n  Russia                                        5,350,861\r\n  Denmark and the Duchies                         969,890\r\n  Germany                                       6,358,229\r\n  France                                        3,828,691\r\n  Spain                                           331,463\r\n  Wallachia and Moldavia                          295,475\r\n  Turkish dominions, not otherwise specified      528,568\r\n  Egypt                                         1,423,193\r\n  Canada                                        2,223,809\r\n  United States                                10,080,911\r\n  Other countries                               1,036,968\r\n\r\nIn the years 1871-5 the United States held the first place, Russia\r\ncame next, and Germany third with only about one-sixth of the\r\nAmerican imports, and Canada was running Germany close. Other\r\nformidable competitors were now arising, and by 1901 the chief\r\nimporting countries[711] were:\r\n\r\n                                               Cwt.\r\n\r\n  Argentina                                  8,309,706\r\n  Russia[712]                                2,580,805\r\n  United States of America                  66,855,025\r\n  Australia                                  6,197,019\r\n  Canada                                     8,577,960\r\n  India                                      3,341,500\r\n\r\nSince then the imports of wheat and flour from the United States have\r\ndecreased, and in 1904 India took the first place, Russia the second,\r\nArgentina the third, and the United States the fourth. However, in\r\n1907 the United States sent more than any other country, followed by\r\nArgentina, India, Canada, Russia, and Australia, in the order named.\r\n\r\nIt is probable in the near future that the imports from the United\r\nStates will decline considerably, for in the last quarter of a\r\ncentury its population has increased 68 per cent. and its wheat area\r\nonly 25 per cent. On the other hand, the population of Canada\r\nincreased 33 per cent. and her wheat area 158 per cent. in the same\r\ntime; while in Argentina an addition of 70 per cent. to the\r\npopulation has been accompanied by an increase of the wheat area from\r\nhalf a million to fourteen million acres. It is probable also that\r\nIndia and Australia will continue to send large supplies, and there\r\nare said to be vast wheat-growing tracts opened up by the Siberian\r\nRailway, so that there seems little chance of wheat rising very much\r\nin price for many years to come, apart from exceptional causes such\r\nas bad seasons and 'corners'.\r\n\r\nMcCulloch, writing in 1843,[713] says that, except Denmark and\r\nIreland, no country of Western Europe 'has been in the habit of\r\nexporting cattle'. Danish cattle, however, could rarely be sold in\r\nLondon at a profit, and Irish cattle alone disturbed the equanimity\r\nof the English farmer.\r\n\r\nFor a few years after the repeal of the corn laws and of the\r\nprohibition of imports of live stock, the imports of live stock, meat,\r\nand dairy produce were, except from Ireland, almost nil[714]; since\r\nthen they have increased enormously, and in 1907 the value of live\r\ncattle, sheep, and pigs imported was £8,273,640, not so great,\r\nhowever, as some years before, owing to restrictions imposed; but this\r\ndecrease has been made up by the increase in the imports of meat,\r\nwhich in 1907 touched their highest figure of 18.751,555 cwt, valued\r\nat the large sum of £41,697,905.[715]\r\n\r\nForty years ago hardly any foreign butter or cheese was imported;\r\nto-day it is perhaps no exaggeration to say that not one hundredth\r\npart of the butter eaten in London is British; in 1907 the amount of\r\nbutter imported was 4,310,156 cwt., and of cheese, 2,372,233 cwt. The\r\nincrease in the imports was largely assisted by the fact that in the\r\nlast half of the nineteenth century English farmers had directed their\r\nattention chiefly to meat-producing animals and neglected the milch\r\ncow. However, of late years great efforts have been made to recover\r\nlost ground, and in England the number of cows and heifers in milk or\r\nin calf has increased from 1,567,789 in 1878 to 2,020,340 in 1906.\r\n\r\nThe regulation of the imports and exports of live stock did not\r\nconcern the legislature so early as those of corn. One of the earliest\r\nstatutes on the subject is II Hen. VII, c. 13, which forbade the\r\nexport of horses and of mares worth more than 6s. 8d., because many\r\nhad been conveyed out of the land, so that there were few left for its\r\ndefence and the price of horses had been thereby increased. A\r\nsubsequent statute, 22 Hen. VIII, c. 7, says this law was disobeyed by\r\nmany who secretly exported horses, so it was enacted that no one\r\nshould export a horse without a licence; and 1 Edw. VI, c. 5,\r\ncontinued this. But after this date the export of horses does not seem\r\nto have occupied the attention of Parliament.\r\n\r\n22 Hen. VIII, c. 7, also forbade the export of cattle and sheep\r\nwithout a licence because so many had been carried out of the realm\r\nthat victual was scarce and cattle dear. By 22 Car. II, c. 13, oxen\r\nmight be exported on payment of a duty of 1s. each, the last statute\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\nAs for sheep, their export without the king's licence had been\r\nforbidden by 3 Hen. VI, c. 2, because men had been in the habit of\r\ntaking them to Flanders and other countries, where they sheared them\r\nand sold the wool and the mutton. 8 Eliz., c. 3, forbade their export,\r\nand 13 and 14 Car. II, c. 18, declared the export of sheep and wool a\r\nfelony.\r\n\r\nThe importation of cattle was forbidden by 15 Car. II, c. 7, which\r\nstated that the 'comeing in of late of vast numbers of cattle already\r\nfatted' had caused 'a very great part of the land of this kingdom to\r\nbe much fallen and like dayly to fall more in their rents and values';\r\ntherefore every head of great cattle imported was to pay 20s. to the\r\nking, 10s. to the informer, and 10s. to the poor after July 1, 1664.\r\nBy 18 Car. II, c. 2, the importation of cattle was declared a common\r\nnuisance, and if any cattle, sheep, or swine were imported they were\r\nto be seized and forfeited. By 32 Car. II, c. 2, this was made\r\nperpetual and continued in force till 1842, though it was repealed as\r\nto Ireland, as we have seen.[716]\r\n\r\nIt appears from the laws dealing with the matter that in the time of\r\nthe Plantagenets England exported butter and cheese. In the reign of\r\nEdward III they were merchandise of the staple, and therefore when\r\nexported had to go to Calais when the staple was fixed there. This\r\ncaused great damage, it is said, to divers persons in England, for the\r\nbutter and cheese would not keep until buyers came; therefore 3 Hen.\r\nVI, c 4, enacted that the chancellor might grant licence to export\r\nbutter and cheese to other places than to the staple.\r\n\r\nThe regulation of the export of wool frequently occupied the attention\r\nof Parliament It has been noticed[717] that the laws of Edgar fixed\r\nits price for export, and Henry of Huntingdon mentions its export in\r\nthe twelfth century, while during the reign of Edward I it was for\r\nsome time forbidden except by licence, which led to its being smuggled\r\nout in wine casks.[718] The _Hundred Rolls_ give the names of several\r\nItalian merchants who were engaged in buying wool for export, the\r\necclesiastical houses, especially the Cistercians, furnishing a great\r\nquantity, and the chief port then for the wool trade was Boston, The\r\nexport was again prohibited in 1337, the great object being to make\r\nthe foreigner pay dearly for our staple product: an object which was\r\ncertainly effected, for when Queen Philippa redeemed her crown from\r\npawn at Cologne in 1342 by a quantity of English wool, 1s. 3-1/2d. a\r\nlb. was the price, and it was even said to sell in Flanders at 3s. a\r\nlb., a price which, expressed in modern money, seems fabulous.[719]\r\nHowever, in the next reign English wool began to decline in price,\r\nowing probably to changes in fashion, but the long wools maintained\r\ntheir superiority and their export was forbidden by Henry VI and\r\nElizabeth.[720]\r\n\r\nIn the reign of James I it was confessed 'that the cloth of this\r\nkingdom hath wanted both estimation and vent in foreign parts, and\r\nthat the wools are fallen from their stated values', so that export\r\nwas prohibited entirely; and 13 and 14 Car. II, c. 18, declared the\r\nexport of wool a felony, though 7 and 8 Will. III, c. 28, says this\r\ndid not deter people from exporting it, so that the law was made more\r\nstringent on the subject, and export continued to be forbidden until\r\n1825.[721] In a letter written in 1677 the fall of rents in England,\r\nwhich had caused the value of estates to sink from twenty-one to\r\nsixteen or seventeen years' purchase, is ascribed mainly to the low\r\nprice of wool,[722] owing to the prohibition of export and increased\r\nimports from Ireland and Spain. It was now, said the writer, worth 7d.\r\ninstead of 12d., and a great quantity of Spanish wool was being sold\r\nin England at low rates. These 'low rates' were 2s. and 2s. 2d. a lb.\r\nfor the best wool, whereas in 1660 the best Spanish wool was 4s. and\r\n4s. 2d. a lb.\r\n\r\nWe have seen[723] that Spanish wool was imported into England in the\r\nMiddle Ages. In 1677, according to Smith,[724] England imported 2,000\r\nbags of 200 lb. each from Spain[725]; in the three years 1709-11,\r\n14,000 bags; in the three years 1713-14, 20,000 bags; and about 1730\r\nsome came from Jamaica, Maryland, and Virginia, and down to 1802\r\nimports were free.[726] In that year a duty of 5s. 3d. a cwt. was\r\nimposed, which in 1819 was raised to 56s. a cwt., which, however, was\r\nreduced to 1d. a lb. on 1s. wool and 1/2d. a lb. on wool under 1s. in\r\n1824. In 1825 colonial wool was admitted free, and in 1844 the duty\r\ntaken off altogether, and imports from our colonies and foreign\r\ncountries soon assumed enormous proportions. Down to 1814 nearly all\r\nour imports of wool came from Spain; after that the greater part came\r\nfrom Germany and the East Indies; but Russia and India soon began to\r\nsend large quantities, and in recent times Australasia has been our\r\nchief importer, in 1907 sending 321,470,554 lb., while New Zealand\r\nsent 158,406,255 lb. out of a total import of 764,286,625 lb. About\r\n1800 our imports of wool were 8,609,368 lb.![727] Of our enormous\r\nimports of wool, however, a very large quantity is re-exported.\r\n\r\nIn 1828 it was stated before the House of Lords that English wool had\r\ndeteriorated considerably during the previous thirty years, owing\r\nchiefly to the farmer increasing the weight of the carcase and the\r\nquantity of wool, so that fineness of fleece was injured. The great\r\nextension of turnips and the introduction of a large breed of sheep\r\nalso appeared to have lessened the value of the fleece, yet English\r\nwool to-day still commands a high price in comparison with that of\r\nother countries, though the price in recent years has declined\r\ngreatly; in 1871 it was 1s. 5-1/2d. a lb., in 1872 1s. 9-1/2d., in\r\n1873 1s. 7d. In 1907 Leicester wool was 12-1/2d., Southdown 14d. to\r\n15d., and Lincoln 12d. a lb.; Australian at the same date being 11d.,\r\nand New Zealand 11-1/2d.\r\n\r\nThe fruit-grower has also had to contend with an enormous foreign\r\nsupply, which nearly always has a better appearance than that grown in\r\nthese islands, though the quality is often inferior. In 1860 apples\r\nwere included with other raw fruits in the returns, so that the exact\r\nfigures are not given, but apparently about 500,000 cwt. came in; by\r\n1903 this had increased to 4,569,546 bushels, and in 1907 3,526,232\r\nbushels arrived. Enormous foreign supplies of grapes, pears, plums,\r\ncherries, and even strawberries have also combined to keep the home\r\nprice down.\r\n\r\nThe decrease in the acreage of hops, from its maximum of 71,789 acres\r\nin 1878 to 44,938 in 1907, was ascribed by the recent Commission to\r\nthe lessening demand for beer in England, the demand for lighter kinds\r\nof beer, and the use of hop substitutes, and not to increase in\r\nforeign competition; which the following figures seem to bear out:\r\n\r\n  IMPORTS OF HOPS.\r\n                                                           Cwt.\r\n\r\n  1861                                                   149,176\r\n  1867                                                   296,117\r\n  1869                                                   322,515\r\n  1870                                                   127,853\r\n  1875                                                   256,444\r\n  1877 (the year before the record acreage planted)      250,039\r\n  1879                                                   262,765\r\n  1903                                                   113,998\r\n  1904                                                   313,667\r\n  1905                                                   108,953\r\n  1906                                                   232,619\r\n  1907                                                   202,324\r\n\r\nIn recent years they have been a loss to the grower; as the average\r\ncrop is a little under 9 cwt. per acre, and the total cost of growing\r\nand marketing from £35 to £45 an acre, it is obvious that prices of\r\nabout £3 per cwt., which have ruled lately, are unremunerative.\r\n\r\nHowever disastrous to the farmer and landowner, the increased\r\nquantities and low prices of food thus obtained have been of\r\ninestimable benefit to the crowded population of England. In 1851 the\r\nwhole corn supply, both English and foreign, afforded 317 lb. per\r\nannum per head of the population of 27 millions. In 1889 the total\r\nsupply gave 400 lb. per head to a population of 37-1/2 millions at a\r\ngreatly reduced cost.[728] The supply of animal food presents similar\r\ncontrasts; in 1851 each person obtained 90 lb., in 1889 115 lb. The\r\naverage value of the imports of food per head in the period 1859-65\r\nwas about 25s.; in the period 1901-7, 65s.[729] The products which\r\nhave stood best against foreign competition are fresh milk, hay and\r\nstraw, the softer kinds of fruit that will not bear carriage well, and\r\nstock of the finest quality. These islands still maintain their great\r\nreputation for the excellent quality of their live stock, and exports,\r\nchiefly of pedigree animals, touched their highest figure in 1906:\r\n\r\n                                            Average per\r\n                 No.        Total Value.       head.\r\n                                £                 £\r\n\r\n  Cattle        5,616        327,335             58\r\n  Sheep        12,716        204,061             16\r\n  Pigs          2,221         20,292              9\r\n\r\n\r\n  1877.[730]\r\n\r\n  Acreage under crops and\r\n    grass in England           24,312,033\r\n\r\n  _Corn crops._\r\n  Wheat                         2,987,129\r\n  Barley or bere                2,000,531\r\n  Oats                          1,489,999\r\n  Rye                              48,604\r\n  Beans                           470,153\r\n  Peas                            306,356\r\n                                ---------\r\n                         Total  7,302,772\r\n\r\n  _Green crops._\r\n  Potatoes                        303,964\r\n  Turnips and swedes            1,495,885\r\n  Mangels                         348,289\r\n  Carrots                          14,445\r\n  Cabbage, kohl rabi, and rape    176,218\r\n  Vetches and other green crops   420,373\r\n                                ---------\r\n                          Total 2,759,174\r\n\r\n  Flax                              7,210\r\n  Hops                             71,239\r\n  Barefallow or uncropped arable  576,235\r\n  Clover, sainfoin, and\r\n    grasses under rotation      2,737,387\r\n                               ----------\r\n                  Total arable 13,454,017\r\n\r\n  Permanent grass, exclusive\r\n    of mountain or heath land  10,858,016\r\n                               ----------\r\n                               24,312,033\r\n\r\n\r\n  1907.\r\n\r\n  Total acreage under\r\n    crops and grass            24,585,455\r\n\r\n  _Corn crops._\r\n  Wheat                         1,537,208\r\n  Barley                        1,411,163\r\n  Oats                          1,967,682\r\n  Rye                              53,837\r\n  Beans                           296,186\r\n  Peas                            164,326\r\n                              -----------\r\n                         Total  5,430,402\r\n\r\n  Potatoes                        381,891\r\n  Turnips and swedes            1,058,292\r\n  Mangels                         436,193\r\n  Cabbage                          65,262\r\n  Kohl rabi                        20,572\r\n  Rape                             79,913\r\n  Vetches or tares                145,067\r\n  Lucerne                          63,379\r\n  Hops                             44,938\r\n  Small fruit                      73,372\r\n  Clover, sainfoin, and\r\n    grasses under rotation      2,611,722\r\n  Other crops                     117,914\r\n  Bare fallow                     248,678\r\n                               ----------\r\n                  Total arable 10,777,595\r\n               Permanent grass 13,807,860\r\n                               ----------\r\n                               24,585,455\r\n\r\n  The small fruit was divided into:\r\n    Strawberries                   23,623\r\n    Raspberries                     6,479-1/2\r\n    Currants and gooseberries      24,178-3/4\r\n    Others                         19,090\r\n                              ---------------\r\n                                   73,371-1/4\r\n\r\nAs arable land has suffered much more than grass from foreign\r\nimports, it was inevitable that this country should become more\r\npastoral; in 1877 the arable land of England amounted to 13,454,017\r\nacres, and permanent grass to 10,858,016. By 1907 this was\r\npractically reversed, the permanent grass amounting to 13,807,860\r\nacres and the arable to 10,777,595. In corn crops the great decrease\r\nhas been in the acreage of wheat, but barley, beans, and peas have\r\nalso diminished, while oats have increased. In green crops there has\r\nbeen a great decrease in turnips and swedes, compensated to some\r\nextent by an increase in mangels, and a sad decrease in hops. The\r\nchanges in thirty years can be gathered from the tables of the Board\r\nof Agriculture given on p. 331.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 no separate return of small fruit was made, but in 1878 the\r\norchards of England, including fruit trees of any kind, covered\r\n161,228 acres, which by 1907 had grown to a total area under fruit of\r\n294,910 acres, among which were 168,576 acres of apples, 8,365 of\r\npears, 11,952 of cherries, and 14,571 of plums.

It is the largest of draught\r\nhorses, attaining a height of 17 to 17.3 hands and a weight of 2,200\r\nlb., its general characteristics being immense strength, symmetrical\r\nproportions, bold free action, and docile disposition. In 1878 the\r\nShire Horse Society was established to improve the breed, and\r\ndistribute sound and healthy sires through the country.\r\n\r\nThe Clydesdale, whose native home is the valley of the Clyde, is not\r\nso large as the Shire, but strong, active, and a fine worker. They\r\nare either derived from a cross between Flemish stallions and\r\nLanarkshire mares, or are an improvement of the old Lanark breed.[734]\r\n\r\nThe Suffolk Punch looks what he is-a thorough farm horse. He stands\r\nlower than the two former breeds, but weighs heavily, often 2,000 lb.\r\nThey are generally chestnut or light dun in colour, and their legs\r\nare without the feather of the Clydesdale and Shire. They have been\r\nlong associated with Suffolk, and were mentioned by Camden in 1586.\r\nAccording to the Suffolk _Stud Book_ of 1880, the Suffolk horses\r\nof to-day are with few exceptions the descendants in the direct male\r\nline of the original breed described by Arthur Young.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATTLE\r\n\r\nWhat was the original breed of cattle in this island is uncertain. The\r\nReport of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in\r\n1887 favours the view that the herds of wild cattle, such as still\r\nexist at Chillingham, represent the original breed of Great Britain.\r\nIt states that the 'urus' was the only indigenous wild ox in this\r\ncountry, and the source of all our domesticated breeds as well as of\r\nthe few wild ones that remain, such as the Chillingham breed, which is\r\nsmall, white, with the inside of the ear red, and a brownish muzzle.\r\nSome, however, assert they are merely the descendants of a\r\ndomesticated breed run wild, which have reverted somewhat to the\r\nancient type.[735]\r\n\r\nAccording to Thorold Rogers, the cattle of the Middle Ages were small\r\nrough animals like the mountain breeds of to-day, and at the end of\r\nthe sixteenth century we have seen they had large horns, were low and\r\nheavy, and for the most part black.[736] The great variety of cattle\r\nin Great Britain may be due to their being the descendants of several\r\nspecies, or to difference of climate and soil, or to spontaneous\r\nvariation, but the chief cause is the diligent selection of breeders.\r\nMarshall is quite positive[737] that the Hereford, Devon, Sussex, and\r\nthe black mountain breeds of Scotland and Wales are all descended from\r\nthe original native breed of this island, that the Shorthorns came\r\nfrom the Continent, and the Longhorns probably from Ireland. Bradley's\r\ndivision of cattle into black, white, and red tells us little.[738]\r\nThere was very little attempt at improvement until the middle of the\r\neighteenth century, for peace was necessary for long continued\r\neffort, and 1746, the date of Culloden, the last battle fought on\r\nBritish soil, may be taken practically as the commencement of the era\r\nof progress.\r\n\r\nThe Shorthorn is the most famous and widely-spread breed of this\r\ncountry, if not in the world; it exceeds in number any other breed in\r\nthe United Kingdom, and most cross-breds have Shorthorn blood in them.\r\nIt adapts itself to any climate, and is equally noted for beef-making\r\nand milk-yielding.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Shorthorns is uncertain; they originated from the\r\nTeeswater and Holderness varieties, but where these came from is a\r\nmatter of dispute. Young, in his _Northern Tour_,[739] says, 'In\r\nYorkshire the common breed was the short-horned kind of cattle called\r\nHolderness, but really the Dutch sort'; and many have said the\r\nHolderness and the Teeswater breeds both came from Holland, and were\r\npractically the same, while others assert the original home of the\r\nTeeswaters was the West Highlands.[740]\r\n\r\nJohn Lawrence speaks of the Dutch breed with short horns in 1726;[741]\r\nbut, unless they were smuggled over, it certainly seems strange that\r\nany Dutch cattle should have been imported in the eighteenth century,\r\nfor the importation of cattle was strictly forbidden during the whole\r\ncentury. It was George Culley's opinion that they came from Holland,\r\nbecause few were found except along the eastern coast; he also knew\r\nfarmers who went over to Holland to buy bulls.[742]\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, it was the cattle of the Teeswater district in\r\nDurham that the Collings improved, and they are still called Durhams\r\nin many parts. The work of the Collings[743] was carried on by Thomas\r\nBooth, who farmed his own estate of Killerby in Yorkshire, where he\r\nturned his attention to Shorthorns about 1790, and by 1814 he was as\r\nwell known as the Collings. He improved the Shorthorns by reducing the\r\nbone, especially the length and coarseness of the legs, the too\r\nprominent hips, and the heavy shoulder bones. In 1819 he removed to\r\nWarlaby, and died there in 1835, having given up the Killerby estate\r\nto his son John, who with his brother Richard ably sustained their\r\nfather's reputation. 'Booth strains' equally with 'Bates strains', the\r\nresults of the work of Bates of Kirkleavington, whose cattle we have\r\nseen at the Oxford Show in 1839, and whose herd was dispersed in 1850,\r\nhave been the foundation of many famous herds, and can be traced in\r\nmany a pedigree animal of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe palmy days of the Shorthorns were the 'seventies' of the last\r\ncentury, when they made fabulous prices. At the great sale at New York\r\nMills, in 1873, eleven females of the Duchess tribe averaged £4,522\r\n14s. 2d., and one cow sold for £8,458 6s. 8d. In 1877 Mr. Loder bought\r\nThird Duchess of Hillhurst for 4,100 guineas; in 1876 Lord Bective\r\ngave 4,300 guineas for Fifth Duchess of Hillhurst, then 16 months old;\r\nand in 1875 the bull Duke of Connaught sold for 4,500 guineas. It was\r\nnot likely that with the advent of bad times these prices would\r\ncontinue, and nothing like them in the Shorthorn world has occurred\r\nsince.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Herefords._[744]\r\n\r\nHerefordshire cattle have long been famous as one of the finest\r\nbreeds in the world. Marshall, writing in 1788, does not hesitate to\r\nsay, 'The Herefordshire breed of cattle, taking it all in all, may\r\nwithout risque be deemed the first breed of cattle in the land.'\r\nTheir origin has been accounted for in various ways. Some say they\r\nwere originally brown or reddish-brown from Normandy or Devon, others\r\nthat they came from Wales, while it is recorded that Lord Scudamore\r\nin the latter half of the seventeenth century introduced red cows\r\nwith white faces from Flanders. However, they do not emerge from\r\nobscurity until about the middle of the eighteenth century, when\r\nMessrs. Tomkins, Weyman, Yeomans, Hewer, and Tully devoted their\r\nenergies to establishing a county breed. There were four varieties of\r\nHerefords, which have now practically merged into the red with white\r\nface, mane, and throat: the mottle face, with red marks intermixed\r\nwith the parts usually white; the dark greys; light greys; and the\r\nred with the white face. The rivalry between the breeders of the\r\nwhite and the mottle faces almost caused the failure of the Herd-Book\r\ncommenced in 1845 by Mr. Eyton. The mottle-faced party seems to have\r\nbeen then the most influential, but the dark and light grey varieties\r\nalso had strong adherents. In 1857 Mr. Duckham took over the\r\nmanagement of the Herd-Book, and to his exertions the breed owes a\r\ndeep debt of gratitude. One of the greatest supporters of the\r\nHerefordshire breed was Mr. Westcar of Creslow, who, starting in\r\n1779, attended Hereford October Fair for forty years, and when the\r\nSmithfield Show commenced in 1799 won innumerable first prizes there\r\nwith Herefordshire cattle. Between 1799 and 1811 twenty of his\r\nHerefordshire prize oxen averaged £106 6s. each, and at the sale of\r\nMr. Ben Tomkins's herd after his death in 1819 twenty-eight breeding\r\nanimals averaged £152, one cow fetching £262 15s. Herefords are\r\nfamous for their feeding qualities at grass, and good stores are\r\nscarce, the best being fattened on their native pastures. They are\r\nnot only almost the only breed in their own county, but few English\r\ncounties south of Shropshire are without them; they have done well in\r\nIreland, and in Canada, the United States, South America, and\r\nAustralia have attained great success. They are not so well qualified\r\nfor crossing as Shorthorns, but have blended well with that breed,\r\nand produced good crosses with Ayrshires and Jerseys, but not with\r\nDevons. It has been said that they are not a favourite sort with\r\nLondon butchers, as they require time to ripen, which does not suit a\r\nhurrying age. Hence they probably flourished best under the old\r\nschool of graziers, who sometimes kept them to six or seven years\r\nold. At all events they are a very fine breed for beef purposes,\r\ntheir meat being particularly tender, juicy, and fine-grained. They\r\nare seldom kept for dairy purposes, being poor milkers; consequently\r\nthe calf is nearly always allowed to run with the dam, which accounts\r\nfor the fact that one seldom sees pure-bred Herefords that are not\r\nwell grown. The highest price paid for a Hereford was 4,000 guineas\r\nfor Lord Wilton in 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Devons._\r\n\r\nThe cattle of North Devon can be traced as the peculiar breed of the\r\ncounty from which they take their name from the earliest records.\r\nBradley mentioned the red cattle of Somerset in 1726, and no doubt\r\nthere were many in Devonshire.[745] William Marshall states (1805),\r\nand he is supported by subsequent writers, that 'they are of the\r\nmiddle horn class', and in his time so nearly resembled the\r\nHerefordshire breed in frame, colour, and horn, as not to be\r\ndistinguishable from them, except in the greater cleanness of the head\r\nand fore-quarters, and their smaller size. Yet they could not have had\r\nthe white faces and throats of the Herefords, as they have always been\r\nfamous for their uniformity in colour--a fine dark red.[746] He also\r\ncompares them to the cattle of Sussex and the native cattle of\r\nNorfolk.[747] The Devons then differed very much in different parts of\r\nthe county; those of North Devon taking the lead, being 'nearly what\r\ncattle ought to be'. They were, considered as draught animals, the\r\nbest workers anywhere beyond all comparison, though rather small, for\r\nwhich deficiency they made up in exertion and agility. As dairy cattle\r\nthey were not very good, since rearing for the east country graziers\r\nhad long been the main object of Devon cattle farmers, but as grazing\r\ncattle they were excellent.\r\n\r\nVancouver, a few years after this, praised their activity in work and\r\ntheir unrivalled aptitude to fatten, but says they were then\r\ndeclining in their general standard of excellence, and in numbers,\r\nowing to the great demand for them from other parts of England, where\r\nthe buyers (Mr. Coke, who had established a valuable herd of them,\r\nand others) spared neither pains nor price to obtain those of the\r\nhighest excellence.\r\n\r\nThis danger was clearly perceived by Francis Quartly of Molland, who\r\nset to work to remedy it by systematically buying the choicest cows he\r\ncould procure. As the reputation and perhaps continuance of the Devon\r\nbreed is due to him more than to any other man, his account of his own\r\nefforts on behalf of it is specially valuable.[748] At the end of the\r\neighteenth century the principal North Devon yeomen were all breeders,\r\nand every week you might see in the Molton Market, their natural\r\nlocality, animals that would now be called choice. There were few\r\ncattle shows in those days, and therefore the relative value of\r\nanimals was not so easily tested. The war prices tempted many farmers\r\nto sell their best bulls and cows out of the district, so that good\r\nanimals were becoming scarce, and the breed generally going back. Mr.\r\nQuartly therefore for years bought all the best animals he could find\r\nwith rare skill and judgement, and continued to improve his stock till\r\nhe brought it to perfection. About the year 1834 cattle shows began at\r\nExeter, and for the first year or two Mr. Quartly did not compete;\r\nthen he allowed his nephews to enter in all the classes, and they\r\nbrought home all the prizes. This lead they kept, and at the Royal\r\nShow at Exeter in 1850 their stock obtained nine out of the ten prizes\r\nfor Devons. The _Devon Herd-Book_ was first published in 1851 by\r\nCaptain T.T. Davy, and a writer in 1858 says that of twenty-nine\r\nprize bulls in the first three volumes twenty-seven were descended\r\nfrom the Quartly bull Forester, and of thirty-four prize cows\r\ntwenty-nine from the cow Curly, also of their stock.\r\n\r\nAmong other famous breeders of Devons contemporary with Quartly were\r\nMessrs. Merson, Davy, Michael Thorne, Yapp, Buckingham, the Halses,\r\nand George Turner.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 Moore says, 'The young heifers of North Devon, with their\r\ntaper legs, the exact symmetry of their form, and their clear coats of\r\ndark red, are pictures of elegance.' Their superiority for grazing and\r\ndraught was proved by the high prices demanded for them, but they were\r\nnot equally esteemed as dairy animals,[749] though of late years this\r\nreproach has been removed. The ploughing of two acres of fallow land\r\nwas the common work of four oxen, which, when fattened at five years\r\nold, would reach eleven score a quarter.\r\n\r\nSince the publication of the Herd-Book, Devons have spread all over\r\nthe world, to Mexico, Jamaica, Canada, Australia, France, and United\r\nStates, and the fact that in their original home they have been\r\nlargely kept by tenant farmers proves them a good rent-paying breed.\r\nYet it cannot be pretended that away from their native country they\r\nare as much valued as the Shorthorn and Hereford.\r\n\r\nThe South Hams breed of South Devon is a distinct variety, though it\r\nis believed to be descended from the 'Rubies'[750] and apparently has\r\nat some time been crossed with the Guernsey; they are good milkers and\r\nattain a great size, but the quality of the meat is decidedly inferior\r\nto that of North Devon.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times the real Devon colour has been red, varying\r\nfrom a dark to a lighter or almost chestnut shade; half a century ago\r\nthe lighter ones were more numerous than at present, and they are\r\noften of richer quality though less hardy than the dark ones.\r\n\r\nThe Sussex is larger and coarser than the Devon, of a deep brown\r\nchestnut colour, very hardy, a beef-producing but not a milk-yielding\r\nsort.\r\n\r\nLonghorns,[751] a generation ago nearly extinct, once the favourite\r\ncattle of the midlands and portions of the north, are descended from a\r\nbreed long established in the Craven district of Yorkshire. 'The true\r\nLancashire,' said Young in 1770, 'were Longhorns, and in Derbyshire\r\nwere a bastard sort of Lancashires.'[752] It was this breed that\r\nBakewell improved, and of late years great efforts, chiefly in\r\nWarwickshire and Leicestershire, have been made to revive it.\r\n\r\nThe Red Polled, or Norfolk Polled, is the only hornless breed of\r\nEnglish cattle, and they are good milkers and fatteners.\r\n\r\nThe Lincoln Red is a small red variety of the Shorthorn.\r\n\r\nMany of the Welsh breeds have spread into the adjacent parts of\r\nEngland, and may be classified as North and South Welsh, or Angleseys\r\nand Castle Martins; black in colour, and generally with long horns.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish cattle--the Aberdeen Angus, the Galloways, the Highland\r\nbreed, and the Ayrshires--are also seen in England, but not so often\r\nas the Jerseys and Guernseys from the Channel Islands, while the\r\nsmall Dexters and Kerrys from Ireland are favourites with some\r\nEnglish farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEEP\r\n\r\nThe sheep of the British Isles may be divided into three main\r\nclasses:--\r\n\r\n1. Longwools, containing Leicesters, Border Leicester's, Cotswolds,\r\nLincolns, Kentish, Devon Longwool, South Devon, Wensleydale, and\r\nRoscommon.\r\n\r\n2. Shortwools: the Oxford Downs, Southdowns, Shropshires, Hampshire\r\nDowns, Suffolks, Ryelands, Somerset and Dorset Horned, and Clun\r\nForest.\r\n\r\n3. Mountain breeds: Cheviots, Blackfaced Mountain, Herdwick, Lonk,\r\nDartmoor, Exmoor, Welsh Mountain, and Limestone.\r\n\r\nThese are all English except the Border Leicester, Cheviot, and\r\nBlackfaced Mountain, which are Scotch; the Welsh Mountain is of\r\ncourse Welsh, and the Roscommon Irish.\r\n\r\n1. The Leicesters, the largest and in many respects the most\r\nimportant of British longwool sheep, are the sheep which Bakewell\r\nimproved so greatly. They are capable of being brought to a great\r\nweight, and their long fine wool averages 7 lb. to the fleece.\r\n\r\nThe Border Leicesters are an offshoot of the last named, bred on the\r\nScottish Border, and originating from the flock which George and\r\nMatthew Culley in 1767 took from the Tees to the Tweed.\r\n\r\nThe Cotswolds have been on the Gloucestershire hills for ages, and\r\nhave long been famous for the length of their fleece, hardiness, and\r\nbreeding qualities.\r\n\r\nThe Lincoln is the result of the old native breed of the county\r\nimproved by Leicester blood. They have larger heads and denser and\r\nheavier wool than the Leicesters, averaging 8 to 9 lb. to the fleece,\r\nbut have been known to yield 14 lb.\r\n\r\nThe Kentish or Romney Marsh have long existed in the district whence\r\nthey obtain their name, but are not much known away from that\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\nThe Devon Longwool is a result of the infusion of Leicester blood\r\namong the old Bampton stock of Devonshire called Bampton Notts or\r\npolled sheep.\r\n\r\nThe South Devons or South Hams are another local breed, and are a\r\nresult of the improvement of the South Hams Notts by the Leicester.\r\n\r\nThe Wensleydales are descendants of the old Teeswater breed, itself a\r\nvariety of the old Leicester and improved by the new Leicesters of\r\nCulley.\r\n\r\n2. Oxford Downs, a modern black-faced breed, now widely spread all\r\nover the midland counties, are a mixture of Cotswolds with Hampshire\r\nDowns and Southdowns, and originated at the beginning of Queen\r\nVictoria's reign, but were not definitely so called till 1857. This\r\ncross of two distinct varieties, the long and the short wool, has\r\napproximated to the shortwool type.\r\n\r\nThe Southdown, formerly Sussex Down, an old breed bred for ages on\r\nthe chalky soils of the South Downs, is 'perhaps', says Youatt, 'the\r\nmost valuable breed in the kingdom.' It was to John Ellman of Glynde,\r\nat the end of the eighteenth century, that they owe their present\r\nperfection, and they have exercised as much influence among the\r\nshortwools as the Leicesters among the longwools.\r\n\r\nThe Shropshire sheep is a descendant of the original Longmynd or old\r\nShropshire sheep, which began to be crossed by the Southdown at the\r\ncommencement of the nineteenth century.[753] They were recognized as a\r\ndistinct breed in 1853, and since then have become one of the most\r\nvalued breeds, combining the symmetry and quality of the Southdown\r\nwith the weight of the Cotswold and the fattening tendency of the\r\nLeicester, with a hardier constitution.\r\n\r\nThe Hampshire Down is another instance of the widespread influence of\r\nthe Southdown, being the result of crossing that breed with the old\r\nWiltshire sheep, which had long curling horns, and the Berkshire\r\nKnott. They are heavier than the Shropshire, and are perhaps more\r\ndistinguished for early maturity than any other breed.\r\n\r\nThe Suffolk is derived from the old horned Norfolk ewe mated with the\r\nSouthdown, and was first granted its name in 1859.\r\n\r\nThe Ryeland is a small, hornless, white-faced breed which has been in\r\nHerefordshire for centuries, but of late years has dwindled in numbers\r\nbefore the advent of the Shropshire.\r\n\r\nThe Somerset and Dorset Horned is another old breed, preserved in a\r\npure state, much improved in modern times, and very hardy.\r\n\r\nThe Clun Forest breed of West Shropshire and the adjacent parts of\r\nWales is a mixture of the Ryeland, Shropshire, and Welsh breeds.\r\n\r\n3. The Cheviot is found on both sides of the hills of that name,\r\nthough Northumberland is said to be its original home, and it was\r\nimproved in the eighteenth century by crossing with the Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe Blackfaced Mountain breed is found chiefly in Scotland, but\r\nthrives on the bleak grazing lands of the north of England.\r\n\r\nThe Herdwicks' home is the hills of Cumberland and Westmoreland,\r\nwhere they are hardy enough to fatten on the poor, thin pasture.\r\n\r\nThe Lonk is the largest mountain breed, belonging to the fells of\r\nYorkshire and Lancashire.\r\n\r\nThe Dartmoors and Exmoors almost certainly came from one stock,\r\nthough the former are now the larger, and are the few real survivors\r\nof the old forest or mountain breeds of England. The Exmoor is\r\nhorned, the Dartmoor hornless.\r\n\r\nThe Welsh Mountain is a small, hardy, soft-woolled breed, their\r\nmutton having the best flavour of any sheep, and their wool making\r\nthe famous Welsh flannel.\r\n\r\nThe Limestone is little known outside the fells of Westmoreland.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIGS\r\n\r\nOur pigs may be roughly divided into white, black, and red; the first\r\ncomprising the Large, Middle, and Small Whites, formerly called\r\nYorkshires; the second the Small Black (Suffolk or Essex), the Large\r\nBlack only recently recognized, but apparently very ancient, and the\r\nBerkshire, which often has white marks on face, legs, or tail. The\r\nred is the Tamworth, one of the oldest breeds, its skin being red\r\nwith dark spots.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[734] Youatt, _Complete Grazier_ (1900), p. 388; cf. pp. 104-5.\r\n\r\n[735] Youatt, _Complete Grazier_ (1900), p. 6.\r\n\r\n[736] See above.\r\n\r\n[737] _Rural Economy of West of England_, i. 235 cf. above, p. 235.\r\n\r\n[738] See above.\r\n\r\n[739] ii. 126; about 1770.\r\n\r\n[740] Youatt, _Complete Grazier_, p. 18, and see 'Druid', _Saddle and\r\nSirloin_.\r\n\r\n[741] Cf. supra, p. 167.\r\n\r\n[742] _Culley on Live Stock_ (1807), p. 42.\r\n\r\n[743] See p. 233.\r\n\r\n[744] Much of these accounts of Herefords and Devons is from the\r\nauthor's articles in the _Victoria County History_.\r\n\r\n[745] See above.\r\n\r\n[746] Risdon, _Survey_ (1810), Introd. p. viii.\r\n\r\n[747] _Rural Economy of West of England_, i. 235.
