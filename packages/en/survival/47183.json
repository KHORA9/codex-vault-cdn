FLINDERS PETRIE,\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR OF EGYPTOLOGY, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamiliar as we are with the methods of science--exact observation and\r\nrecord, comparison, and the strict weeding out of hypotheses--yet\r\nsuch methods have only gradually been applied to various branches of\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\nGeometry became a science long ago, zoölogy much later, medicine\r\nonly a generation or two ago, and the history of man is but just\r\nbeing developed into a science. What was done for other sciences by\r\nthe pioneers of the past is now being done in the present day for\r\narchæology. We now have to devise methods, to form a notation for\r\nrecording facts, and to begin to lay out our groundwork of knowledge.\r\nWith very few exceptions, it may be said of Egypt that there is no\r\npublication of monuments before this century that is of the least use,\r\nno record or dating of objects before 1860, and no comparison or study\r\nof the history of classes of products before 1890. Thus, the work of\r\nrecent years in Egyptology is really the history of the formation of a\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe great stride that has been made in the last six years is the\r\nopening up of prehistoric Egypt, leading us back some two thousand\r\nyears before the time of the pyramid builders. Till recently, nothing\r\nwas known before the age of the finest art and the greatest buildings,\r\nand it was a familiar puzzle how such a grand civilization could have\r\nleft no traces of its rise. This was only a case of blindness on the\r\npart of explorers. Upper Egypt teems with prehistoric remains, but,\r\nas most of what appears is dug up by plunderers for the market, until\r\nthere is a demand for a class of objects, very little is seen of them.\r\nNow that the prehistoric has become fashionable, it is everywhere to\r\nbe seen. The earlier diggers were dazzled by the polished colossi, the\r\nmassive buildings, the brilliant sculptures of the well-known historic\r\ntimes, and they had no eyes for small graves, containing only a few\r\njars or, at best, a flint knife.\r\n\r\nThe present position of the prehistory of Egypt is that we can now\r\ndistinguish two separate cultures before the beginning of the Egyptian\r\ndynasties, and we can clearly trace a sequence of manufactures and art\r\nthroughout long ages before the pyramid builders, or from say 6000 B.\r\nC., giving a continuous history of eight thousand years for man in\r\nEgypt. Continuous I say advisedly, for some of the prehistoric ways are\r\nthose kept up to the present time.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest stage of this prehistoric culture metal was already\r\nused and pottery made. Why no ruder stages are found is perhaps\r\nexplained by the fact that the alluvial deposits of the Nile do not\r\nseem to be much older than eight thousand years. The rate of deposit\r\nis well known--very closely one metre in a thousand years--and borings\r\nshow only eight metres thick of Nile mud in the valley. Before that\r\nthe country had enough rain to keep up the volume of the river, and\r\nit did not drop its mud. It must have run as a rapid stream through a\r\nbarren land of sand and stones, which could not support any population\r\nexcept paleolithic hunters. With the further drying of the climate, the\r\nriver lost so much velocity that its mud was deposited, and the fertile\r\nmud flats made cultivation and a higher civilization possible. At\r\nthis point a people already using copper came into the country. Their\r\nbodies were buried in shallow, circular pit-graves, covered with goat\r\nskins, which were fastened rarely by a copper pin; before the face was\r\nplaced a simple bowl of red and black pottery, and some of the valued\r\nmalachite was placed in the hands. The body was sharply contracted,\r\noften with the knees almost touching the face, and the hands were\r\nusually in front of the face.\r\n\r\nVery soon they developed their pottery into varied and graceful forms,\r\nand decorated it with patterns in white clay applied to the dark-red\r\nsurface, but it continued to be entirely hand-made, without the use of\r\nthe potter’s wheel. The patterns, usually copied from basketwork, show\r\nthe source of the forms of the cups and vases. The modern Kabyle, in\r\nthe highlands of Algeria, has kept up the same patterns on hand-made\r\npottery, and the same use of white clay on a red base. It is probably\r\nto a Libyan people that this civilization is first due, and the\r\nskulls of these prehistoric Egyptians are identical with those of the\r\nprehistoric Algerians from the dolmens and the modern Algerians. This\r\nfirst growth of the civilization not only developed pottery, but also\r\nthe carving of stone vases entirely by hand. The principal type of\r\nthese is the cylinder, with many small variations. Figures were carved\r\nin alabaster and bone, and modeled in clay and paste; these are rude,\r\nbut show that the type of the race was fine, with a high forehead and\r\npointed beard. The use of marks denoting property was common, and such\r\nmarks seem to be the earliest stages of the system of signs which\r\ndeveloped later into the alphabet. This civilization had apparently\r\npassed its best time, decoration had ceased on the pottery, when a\r\nchange came over all classes of work.\r\n\r\nThe second prehistoric civilization seems to have belonged to a people\r\nkindred to that of the first age, as much of the pottery continued\r\nunchanged, and only gradually faded away. But a new style arose of a\r\nhard, buff pottery, painted with patterns and subjects in red outline.\r\nShips are represented with cabins on them, and rowed by a long bank\r\nof oars. The use of copper became more general, and gold and silver\r\nappear also. Spoons of ivory, and rarely of precious metals, were\r\nmade, but hair combs, which were common before, ceased to be worn.\r\nStone vases were commonly carved in a variety of hard and ornamental\r\nstones, but always of the barrel outline and not the early cylinder\r\nshapes. Flint-working reached the highest stage ever known in any\r\ncountry, the most perfect mastery of the material having been acquired.\r\nThough this civilization was in many respects higher than that which\r\npreceded it, yet it was lower artistically, the figures being ruder\r\nand always flat, instead of in the round. Also the use of signs was\r\ndriven out, and disappeared in the later stage of this second period.\r\nThe separation of these two different ages has been entirely reached\r\nby the classification of many hundreds of tombs, the original order of\r\nwhich could be traced by the relation of their contents. In this way\r\na scale of sequence has been formed, which enables the range of any\r\nform of pottery or other object to be exactly stated, and every fact of\r\nconnection discovered can be at once reduced to a numerical scale as\r\ndefinite as a scale of years. For the first time a regular system of\r\nnotation has been devised for prehistoric remains, and future research\r\nin each country will be able to deal with such ages in as definite a\r\nmanner as with historic times. The material for this study has come\r\nentirely from excavations of my own party at Nagada (1895), Abadiyeh,\r\nand Hu (1899); but great numbers of tombs of these same ages have been\r\nopened without record by M. de Morgan (1896-’97), and by French and\r\nArab speculators in antiquities.\r\n\r\nThe connection between these prehistoric ages and the early historic\r\ntimes of the dynastic kings of Egypt is yet obscure. The cemeteries\r\nwhich would have cleared this have unhappily been looted in the last\r\nfew years without any record, and it is only the chance of some new\r\ndiscoveries that can be looked to for filling up the history. We can at\r\nleast say that the pottery of the early kings is clearly derived from\r\nthe later prehistoric types, and that much of the civilization was in\r\ncommon. But it is clear that the second prehistoric civilization was\r\ndegrading and losing its artistic taste for fine work before the new\r\nwave of the dynastic or historic Egyptians came in upon it.\r\n\r\nThese early historic people are mainly known by the remains of the\r\ntombs of the early kings, found by M. Amelineau at Abydos (1896-’99),\r\nand probably the first stage of the same race is seen in the rude\r\ncolossi of the god Min, which I found at Koptos (1894). Unhappily,\r\nthe work at Abydos was not recorded, and it is not known now out of\r\nwhich of many kings’ tombs, nor even out of which cemeteries, the\r\nobjects have come. Hence scientific results are impossible, unless\r\nenough material has escaped the careless and ignorant workmen to\r\nreward more accurate reworking of the same ground. We can at present\r\nonly glean a general picture of the early royal civilization from\r\nAbydos, supplemented by some splendid carvings of two reigns found at\r\nHierakonpolis (1897-’98) by Mr. Quibell.\r\n\r\nThe burials continued to be in tombs of the same form--rectangular pits\r\nlined with brickwork and roofed over with beams and brushwood. But they\r\nwere made larger, and, in the case of the royal tombs, great halls were\r\nformed about fifty by thirty-five feet, roofed with beams eighteen\r\nor twenty feet long. In these royal tombs were placed a profusion of\r\nvases of hard and beautiful stones, bowls of slate, and immense jars\r\nof alabaster; these contained the more valuable offerings of precious\r\nointments and other funereal treasures. Besides these, there were\r\nhundreds of great jars of pottery, containing provision of bread,\r\nmeats, dried fruits, water, beer, and wine. Doubtless there were many\r\nvases of metals, but these have been almost always robbed from the tomb\r\nanciently. Around the tomb were the small graves of the retainers of\r\nthe king, each with a lesser store like that of their master. The royal\r\ntomb was denoted by a great tablet bearing the king’s spiritual name\r\nby which he would be known in the future world. The private tombs had\r\nsmall tablets, about a foot and a half high, with the names of their\r\noccupants. As all these tablets show considerable weathering, it seems\r\nthat they were placed visible above the tomb. Tombs of the subsequent\r\nkings were elaborated with small chambers around the great one, to\r\ncontain the offerings, and even a long passage was formed with dozens\r\nof chambers along each side of it, each chamber containing a separate\r\nkind of offering.\r\n\r\nTurning now to some of the remains of these kings during their life,\r\nwe learn that they were occupied with frequent wars--the gradual\r\nconsolidation of the kingdom of Egypt. One king will record the myriads\r\nof slain enemies, another gives a picture of a captive king brought\r\nbefore him with over a million living captives, the regular Egyptian\r\nnotation for such large numbers being already complete. Another king\r\nshows his triumphal entry to the temple, with the slain enemies laid\r\nout before him. On other sculptures are shown the peaceful triumphs\r\nof canalization and reclamation of land, which are alluded to in the\r\ntraditions of the early dynasties preserved by Greek historians. All\r\nthese scenes are given us on the slate carvings and great mace heads\r\ncovered with sculpture from Hierakonpolis.\r\n\r\nThus in these great discoveries of the last few years we can trace at\r\nleast three successive peoples, and see the gradual rise of the arts,\r\nfrom the man who was buried in his goat skins, with one plain cup by\r\nhim, up to the king who built great monuments and was surrounded by\r\nmost sumptuous handiwork. We see the rise of the art of exquisite flint\r\nflaking, and the decline of that as copper came more commonly into use.\r\nWe see at first the use of signs, later on disused by a second race,\r\nand then superseded by the elaborate hieroglyph system of the dynastic\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nThe mixture of various races was surmised long ago from the varied\r\nportraiture of the early times. It is now shown more plainly than\r\never on these early monuments. We see represented the king of the\r\ndynastic type, a scribe with long, wavy hair, a chief of the dynastic\r\nshaven-headed type, another with long, lank hair, and another with a\r\nbeard, while the enemies are shown with curly hair and narrow beards\r\nlike Bedouin. Four different peoples are here in union against a\r\nfifth. And this diversity of peoples lasts on long into the historic\r\ntimes. After several centuries of a united Egypt, under the pyramid\r\nbuilders, we find that some people buried in the old contracted\r\nposition, others cut up the body and wrapped every bone separately in\r\ncloth, while others embalmed the body whole. Thus great diversity of\r\nbelief and custom still prevailed for perhaps a thousand years after\r\nthe unification of Egypt. So useless is it to think of “the ancient\r\nEgyptians” as an unmixed race gradually rising into “a consciousness of\r\nnationality.”\r\n\r\nThe excavations at Deshasheh in 1897, which first showed me the\r\ndiversity of burials, also showed that the type of the race had already\r\nbecome unified by intermixture, and that, strange to say, four thousand\r\nyears later, after untold crossings with many invaders, the type was\r\nunchanged. Later work at Dendereh and elsewhere has pointed to the\r\nconclusion that a mixture of a new race is subdued to the type of\r\nthe country by the effect of climate and surroundings within a few\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the purely classical Egyptian work, the principal\r\ndiscoveries of the last few years have given us new leading examples\r\nin every line. The great copper statue of King Pepy, with his son,\r\ndates from before 3000 B. C. It is over life size, and entirely wrought\r\nin hammered copper, showing a complete mastery in metal work of the\r\nhighest artistic power. Probably of the same age is a head of a figure\r\nof the sacred hawk, wrought hollow in a single mass of hammered gold,\r\nweighing over a pound; this again shows work of noble dignity and\r\npower. Both of these were found at Hierakonpolis in 1898, and are now\r\nin the Cairo Museum.\r\n\r\nSome centuries later was made the exquisite jewelry found at Dahshur in\r\nthe graves of three princesses. This is a revelation of the delicacy\r\npossible in goldsmith’s work. The soldering of the minute parts of\r\nthe gold is absolutely invisible. The figures of hawks are made up\r\nof dozens of microscopic pieces of colored stone--lazuli, turquoise,\r\ncarnelian--every one cut to the forms of the feathers, and every piece\r\nhaving a tiny cell of soldered gold strip to hold it in place, yet the\r\nwhole bird only about half an inch high. The finest colored enameling\r\never made would be child’s play compared with a piece of this early\r\njewelry. The exquisite grace of form, harmony of coloring, and sense of\r\nperfection leave the mind richer by a fresh emotion, after seeing such\r\na new world of skill. Coming down to about 1500 B. C., a large work\r\nhas been done in the last six years in clearing the temple of Queen\r\nHatshepsut at Deir el Bahri, on the western side of Thebes. That great\r\nruler had there commemorated the events of her reign, particularly\r\nthe expedition to the south of the Red Sea to obtain the plants of\r\nthe sacred incense and other valued products. The attention shown to\r\nexact figuring of plants and animals makes this valuable as a record of\r\nnatural history. This clearance has been made by Dr. Naville for the\r\nEnglish fund. Meanwhile, Franco-Egyptian officials have been clearing\r\nout the Temple of Karnak, on the opposite bank, but with disastrous\r\neffect. The huge columns, built poorly of small blocks by Rameses II,\r\nstand now below the level of the inundation, and, after removing the\r\nearth accumulated around them, the Nile water has free circulation.\r\nThis has dissolved the mortar so much that nine of these Titanic\r\ncolumns of the Great Hall fell last year, and three more threaten to\r\nfollow them.\r\n\r\nThe Valley of the Tombs of the Kings has been prohibited ground\r\nto foreign explorers for over forty years, although the official\r\ndepartment never did any work there. The native plunderers, however,\r\nturned up many years ago the beautiful chair of Queen Hatshepsut, and\r\nlately they found the entry to still unopened royal tombs. The secret\r\npassed--for a consideration--to the Department of Antiquities, and two\r\nroyal tombs were opened. These contained the bodies of several kings of\r\nthe eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties--one undisturbed, the others\r\nmoved from elsewhere. With these was a crowd of objects of funereal\r\nfurniture. Unhappily, nothing is published in detail of any official\r\ndiscoveries; with the exception of the first find of the Dahshur\r\njewelry, there has never been any full account issued of the great\r\ndiscoveries in the most important sites, which are reserved to the\r\nGovernment. The great group of kings found at Deir el Bahri, the great\r\nnecropolis of the priests of Amen, the second find of Dahshur jewelry,\r\nthe second group of royal mummies, of all these we know nothing but\r\nwhat has appeared in newspapers, or some partial account of one branch\r\nof the subject. Hardly any publication has ever appeared, such as\r\nthe English societies issue every year about the produce of their\r\nexcavations.\r\n\r\nMany of the royal temples of the nineteenth dynasty at Thebes were\r\nexplored by the English in 1896. The Ramesseum was completely examined,\r\nthrough all the maze of stone chambers around it. But the most\r\nimportant result was the magnificent tablet of black granite, about ten\r\nfeet high and five wide, covered on one side with an inscription of\r\nAmen Hotep III, and on the other side with an inscription of Merenptah.\r\nThe latter account, of about 1200 B. C., mentions the war with the\r\n“People of Israel”; this is the only naming of Israel on Egyptian\r\nrecords, and is several centuries earlier than any Assyrian record of\r\nthe Hebrews. It has, of course, given rise to much discussion, which is\r\ntoo lengthy to state here.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important results of historical Egyptian times is the\r\nlight thrown on prehistoric Greek ages. The pottery known as “Mykenæan”\r\nsince the discoveries of Schliemann in the Peloponnesus was first dated\r\nin Egypt at Gurob in 1889; next were found hundreds of vase fragments\r\nat Tell el Amarna in 1892; and since then several Egyptian kings’ names\r\nhave been found on objects in Greece, along with such pottery. The\r\nwhole of this evidence shows that the grand age of prehistoric Greece,\r\nwhich can well compare with the art of classical Greece, began about\r\n1600 B. C., was at its highest point about 1400 B. C., and became\r\ndecadent about 1200 B. C., before its overthrow by the Dorian invasion.\r\n\r\nBesides this dating, Greece is indebted to Egypt for the preservation\r\nof the oldest texts of its classics. Fragments of Plato almost\r\ncontemporary with his lifetime, pages of Thucydides, whole books of\r\nthe Iliad, and the celebrated recent publications of Bacchylides and\r\nHerondas, all are due to Egypt. Moreover, of Christian times we have a\r\nleaf of an early collection of Sayings of Jesus, a leaf of gospel about\r\ntwo centuries older than any other biblical manuscript, and a host of\r\ndocuments bearing on early Christianity, such as the Gospel of Peter\r\nand other apocryphal writings which were later banned by the Church.\r\n\r\nNow it may be asked how all these discoveries are made--indeed, many\r\npeople take for granted that some government kindly pays for it all.\r\nOn the contrary, the only official influences are a severe check\r\non such scientific work. While a native Egyptian can plunder tombs\r\nwith but little hindrance, any one desiring to preserve objects and\r\npromote knowledge must (after obtaining the permission of the Egyptian\r\nGovernment for the exact place he wants to work) be officially\r\ninspected at his own expense (a matter of twenty or thirty pounds a\r\nseason), and then, after all, give up to the Government half of all he\r\nfinds, without any recompense. The English Government long ago gave up\r\nall claim for British subjects to occupy any post in the Cairo Museum,\r\nthus putting a decisive bar on the hopes of would-be students and\r\nhindering the object very effectually.\r\n\r\nIn face of all these disadvantages, work has yet been carried on by\r\nthe Egypt Exploration Fund and by the Egyptian Research Account; both\r\nrely on English and American support, and the latter body is intended\r\nexpressly to help students in training. Besides these, private work has\r\nbeen carried on during several years by two or three other explorers,\r\npartly at their own cost, partly helped by friends. The two societies\r\nabove named have kept to the principles that everything shall be\r\npublished as soon as possible, and that all the antiquities removed\r\nfrom Egypt shall be divided among public museums as gifts in return\r\nfor the support from various places, nothing ever being sold publicly\r\nor privately. In this way several centers in America send large annual\r\ncontributions, have representatives on the London Committee of the\r\nExploration Fund, and receive their share for museums every year.\r\n\r\nBesides this organizing of ways and means, there is quite as important\r\norganization needed in the excavations. At present most of the\r\nabove-named work is done by a corps of men who have been engaged at\r\nit for many years. They leave their homes and assemble as soon as the\r\nwinter begins; any dealing in antiquities or misconduct since the last\r\nseason excludes them from rejoining. They each know their work, what\r\nto preserve, how to leave everything intact in the ground where found,\r\nand how best to manage different kinds of excavating. With such men it\r\nis always possible to screw more information out of a site, however\r\nmuch it may have been already wrecked in ancient or modern times. And\r\nit is far safer to leave such men unwatched, with the certainty that\r\nthey will receive a fair value for all they find, than it is to drive a\r\ngang under the lash, on bare wages, without rewards to keep them from\r\npilfering. The English system means mutual confidence and good faith;\r\nthe native and French system of force means the destruction of both\r\ninformation and antiquities.\r\n\r\nAnd yet besides this there is the essential business of observing and\r\nrecording. Every hole dug must have a meaning and be understood, as to\r\nthe date of the ground at different levels and the nature of the place.\r\nEverything must be spelled out as the work advances; any difficulties\r\nthat can not be explained must be tried with all possible hypotheses;\r\neach detail must either fall into place as agreeing with what is known,\r\nor be built in as a new piece of knowledge.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago nothing was known of the date of any Egyptian\r\nmanufactures, not even of pottery or beads, which are the commonest.\r\nNow, at present it is seldom that anything is found which can not be\r\ndated tolerably near by, and in some classes of remains the century or\r\neven the reign can be stated at once, without a single word to show it.\r\nThe science of Egyptian archæology is now in being.\r\n\r\nIn this, therefore, as in many other matters, the Anglo-Saxon taste\r\nfor private enterprise is the ruling power, and in spite of political\r\nobstacles and of taxation, which are happily unknown in other sciences,\r\nthe private work of individuals has quietly traced out the foundations\r\nof one of the earliest civilizations of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOLD SANDS OF CAPE NOME.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. ANGELO HEILPRIN,\r\n\r\nLATE PRESIDENT OF THE PHILADELPHIA GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting contributions to the history of gold and\r\ngold mining has undoubtedly been discovered in the region of Cape\r\nNome, Alaska, during the past summer. Vague reports have from time to\r\ntime, for a period of a year or more, been sent out from the bleak\r\nand inhospitable shores of Bering Sea of the discovery there of rich\r\ndeposits of placer gold, and of almost fabulous wealth acquired by a\r\nfew fortunate prospectors--a new Klondike on American soil--but these\r\ngained little credence beyond the portals of transportation companies\r\nand the organizers of “boom” enterprises. A few of the more credulous\r\nand those unmindful of adventure and hardship took practical action on\r\nthe receipt of the reports, and prepared to buffet the still ice-bound\r\nwaters of the Pacific to gain early access to the new land of promise.\r\nIn a brief period the fame of Golovnin Bay had been spread broadcast,\r\nonly to be again dimmed by the later announcements that the earlier\r\nreports of finds were only “fakes.” Making and unmaking are a part of\r\nall new mining centers, and in an incredibly short time all manner of\r\nconclusions are arrived at regarding the possibilities of a location.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OFF-SHORE VIEW OF NOME.]\r\n\r\nNew reports of finds made along the coast of Bering Sea, about fifty\r\nmiles west of Golovnin Bay, called renewed attention to the region,\r\nand those who in the early summer of the past year (1899) timidly\r\nventured their fortunes to share in a possible discovery, found, on\r\ntheir arrival at the tundra-bound shores about Cape Nome, that miles of\r\nterritory had already been located as claim sites, that sluice-boxes\r\nwere in full operation, and that sackfuls of gold dust and nuggets had\r\nbeen carefully laid to one side, representing “outputs” of tens of\r\nthousands of dollars. At this time many of the journals of civilization\r\nin the East, repeating the warnings that they persistently threw out\r\nfollowing the discovery of gold in the Klondike, jealously guarded\r\nthe secrets of the earth by doubting, or even denying, the claims\r\nto discovery, but, withal, wisely counseling against that haphazard\r\nand purseless rush which is one of the invariable accompaniments of\r\ngold announcements. A new mining district had suddenly sprung into\r\nexistence, and before two months had passed--i. e., by the early days\r\nof September--a full front of tents and frame houses took possession\r\nof what continues to remain a dreary and desolate expanse of ocean\r\nbeach--sufficiently pleasant in the quiet, balmy days of summer and\r\nautumn, but wofully exposed to the hurricane blasts of the arctic\r\nwinter--and gave shelter to from three to four thousand adventurers,\r\nwhere formerly a few Indians and Eskimos from the still farther\r\nnorthwest and King’s Island constituted a straggling and accidental\r\npopulation. This, in brief, is the initial history of the Nome or Anvil\r\nCity mining region, which will almost certainly call to it in the\r\ncoming spring fifteen to twenty thousand additional inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STREET IN NOME.]\r\n\r\nFar more interesting to the one who has not been properly rewarded\r\nin his search for placer claims than the placer deposits themselves\r\nare the gold-bearing beach sands, whose productivity will mainly be\r\nresponsible for the influx of population to the new region. From them,\r\nby crude and simple methods, has been taken, in barely more than two\r\nmonths, gold to the value of more than a million dollars, and what the\r\npossibilities for the future may be no one is wise enough to tell. So\r\nclearly exaggerated did the accounts of the free-sand rocking appear,\r\neven those coming from reputable miners who were personally known to\r\nme, that I could hardly bring myself to take them at their full value,\r\nbut, being accidentally drifted in the course of a summer’s wanderings\r\nto St. Michael, above the mouth of the Yukon River, I had easy\r\nopportunity to verify for myself the accuracy of the statements that\r\nhad been sent out, and to cast a geological glance at the situation. My\r\nexamination of the region was confined to a few of the later days of\r\nSeptember and to early October.\r\n\r\nThe geographical position of the Nome region is the southern face of\r\nthe peninsular projection of Alaska which separates Kotzebue Sound on\r\nthe north from Bering Sea on the south, and terminates westward in\r\nCape Prince of Wales the extent of the North American continent. In\r\na direct line of navigation, it lies about twenty-five hundred miles\r\nnorthwest of Seattle and one hundred and seventy miles southeast of\r\nSiberia. The nearest settlement of consequence to it prior to 1899\r\nwas St. Michael, a hundred miles to the southeast, the starting point\r\nof the steamers for the Yukon River; but during the year various\r\naggregations of mining population had built themselves up in closer\r\nrange, and reduced the isolation from the civilized world by some sixty\r\nmiles. The Nome district as settled centers about the lower course of\r\nthe Snake River, an exceedingly tortuous stream in its tundra course,\r\nwhich emerges from a badly degraded line of limestone, slaty, and\r\nschistose mountain spurs generally not over seven hundred to twelve\r\nhundred feet elevation, but backed by loftier granitic heights, and\r\ndischarges into the sea at a position thirteen miles west of Cape Nome\r\nproper. Three miles east of this mouth is the discharge of Nome River.\r\nBoth streams have a tidal course of several miles. Nome, or, as it was\r\nfirst called, Anvil City--named from a giant anvil-like protrusion of\r\nslate rock near to the summit of the first line of hills--occupies in\r\ngreater part the tundra and ocean beach of the eastern or left bank of\r\nSnake River, but many habitations, mainly of a temporary character,\r\nhave been placed on the bar beach which has been thrown up by the sea\r\nagainst the mouth of the stream, and deflected its course for some\r\ndistance parallel with the ocean front. A number of river steamers (one\r\neven of considerable size) and dredges have found a suitable anchorage\r\nor “harbor” in the barrier-bound waters, and much driftwood passes into\r\nthem at times of storms and higher waters, when the greatly constricted\r\nand shallow mouth is made passable. The entire region is treeless, and\r\nthe nearest approach to woodland is in the timber tract of Golovnin\r\nBay and its tributaries, about forty miles to the northeast. A fairly\r\ndense growth of scrub willow, three to five feet in height, with elms\r\nand alders, forms a fringe or delimiting line to parts of the courses\r\nof the streams in the tundra, which greatly undulates in the direction\r\nof the foothills and incloses tarnlike bodies of fresh and slightly\r\nbrackish waters. It is covered merely with a low growth of flowering\r\nherbaceous plants, grass, and moss, with a somewhat scantier admixture\r\nof the dwarf birch, arctic willow, and crowberry. The surface is\r\npre-eminently swampy during the warmer periods of the year, and walking\r\nover it means either wading through the water or risking continuous\r\njumps to and from the individual clumps of matted grass and moss--the\r\nso-called “nigger-heads.” The greater part of the tundra seems to rest\r\non gravel and sand--doubtless of both marine and fluviatile origin--and\r\nordinarily the frozen stratum is already reached at a depth of two or\r\nthree feet, sometimes less. In early October of the past year it was\r\nstill too “open” to permit of easy walking over it, but in quite early\r\nhours of the morning the surface afforded fair lodgment to moderate\r\nweights. Fragmentary parts of the skeleton of the mammoth have been\r\nfound here and there, even loose on the top grass, but where found\r\nin such situations it is by no means certain that they had not been\r\nredeposited by high tidal wash. A large fragment of thigh bone, with\r\nshoulder blade, which I found about an eighth of a mile inland and\r\nperhaps fifteen feet above the water, was associated with one of\r\nthe mandibular bones of the whale. I could obtain no information as\r\nto their having been possibly carried to their present position by\r\nman, but it may have been the case. A large skull, which I owe to the\r\nkindness of Mr. Inglestadt and to Mr. Louis Sloss, Jr., manager of the\r\nAlaska Commercial Company, was obtained, as nearly as I could determine\r\nthrough inquiry on the spot, from about the same locality. Where it\r\nabuts upon the sea the tundra stands from eight to twenty feet above\r\nit, at places descending to even lower levels. The sea face is almost\r\neverywhere an abrupt one, showing undercutting by high water, and it\r\nis continued by a broad, rapidly sloping sand and shingle beach, which\r\npacks firmly, and almost immediately beneath the surface exhibits a\r\ndistinctly stratified construction--the alternate layers of fine, flat\r\ngravel, coarse, clayey sand, and finer “ruby” (fragmented garnet) sand\r\nsloping like the surface, although generally with a milder pitch, to\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A NATIVE OF THE LAND OF NOME.]\r\n\r\nThe open sea front, with inland tundra, is continued for a distance\r\nof about fourteen miles westward of Nome, where it is interrupted\r\nby the mountains, in a west-southwest course, reaching the sea;\r\nflat-topped Sledge Island, so much recalling in aspect some of the\r\nislands lying off Whale Sound, in the northwest of Greenland, is their\r\noceanic continuation for some distance, with sharp breaks on both the\r\noceanic and inner sides. It is probable that much of the _débris_\r\nthat has resulted from the disruption of the mountain masses has been\r\ndistributed littorally by the sea, with an eastward wash, to form the\r\nbars and shallows which for some distance stretch along the coast;\r\nnor is it impossible that some of the giant bowlders of limestone,\r\nmarble, granite, and syenite which are found on the margin of the\r\nbeach about four or five miles west of Nome, some of them measuring\r\neight and twelve feet or more in diameter, and all of them smoothly\r\nrounded and evenly polished, represent a part of this destruction.\r\nAt the same time, there is good reason to suspect that they may have\r\nbeen deposited by ice action, either as erratics of floe ice coming\r\nfrom the northwest, or of glacial distribution from the region of the\r\nmountains. Whatever may have been the final stage in the history of the\r\namphitheater of Nome (the region included between Cape Nome and Sledge\r\nIsland), which my limited observation did not permit me to determine\r\nto full satisfaction, it is almost certain, even in the absence\r\nof the ordinary glacial testimony, that the region is one of past\r\nglaciation, and that much of the gravel and bowlder material of the\r\nocean front is of morainic origin, so modified and altered in position\r\nby readjustments of the land and water as to have lost its proper\r\nphysiographic contours. The aspect of the hills and valleys is almost\r\nprecisely that of some of the regions of Greenland which have only\r\nquite recently been vacated by the glaciers, while the composition of\r\nthe shingle--the inclusion over so long a front of bowlders from beyond\r\nthe first line of mountain heights, many of them most markedly grooved\r\nand polished--is also highly suggestive of glacial deposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HARBOR OF SNAKE RIVER (NOME).]\r\n\r\nThe gold sands, or sands that are worked for gold, are merely the\r\nordinary materials of the beach, loose and incoherent like most\r\nseashore sands, and particularly defining horizons three to six\r\nfeet below the surface. In regular stratified layers, with fine and\r\nmoderately coarse gravel, they embrace four or five distinct layers of\r\nfragmented garnets (the components of the so-called “ruby sand”), and\r\nit is from these, and at this time almost exclusively from the bottom\r\nlayer of three to five inches thickness, which is popularly described\r\nas lying on “bed rock”--in most places merely a hard-pan of arenaceous\r\nclay or argillaceous sand, with no true rock to define it--that most of\r\nthe gold is obtained. Each ruby band nearer to the top seems to contain\r\nless and less gold, and there is no question that the different layers\r\nare merely reformations by the sea from those of earlier deposition,\r\njust as surface shingle deposits generally are in part reconstructions\r\nof underlying beds. That the ocean is to-day depositing the ruby sand\r\nis unmistakably shown by the great patches of this sand lying on the\r\nsurface and its incoming in the path of nearly every storm. Even these\r\nsurface sands are mildly gold-bearing, showing that the gold, despite\r\nits high specific gravity, may be buoyed up and wafted in by such a\r\nlight medium as water when it has been reduced to sufficiently minute\r\nparticles or scalelike forms. It is little wonder that a general belief\r\nhas gained currency with the more enthusiastic locators that the sand\r\ngold is a deposition or precipitate from the sea.\r\n\r\nThe gold itself occurs in an exceedingly fine state of subdivision, too\r\nfine in most cases to be caught without mercury or the best arrangement\r\nof “blanketings.” Much of it is really in the condition of colors\r\ndissected nearly to their finest particles, and it is hardly surprising\r\nthat it should have so long escaped detection. Occasionally pieces to\r\nthe value of three to six cents are obtained in the pans, and I was\r\nwitness to the finding of a scale with the value of perhaps nearly\r\ntwenty cents. The usual magnetitic particles are associated with the\r\ngold, and their origin can clearly be traced to the magnetite which\r\nis so abundantly found in some of the schists (micaceous, chloritic,\r\nand talcose schists), which, judged by the fragments and bowlders\r\nthat everywhere lie in the path of the streams of the tundra, must be\r\nclosely similar to the series of schists of the Klondike region. The\r\nparticles of fragmented garnet, which by their astonishing abundance\r\ngive so distinctive a coloring to the layers which they compose or\r\nconstitute, are of about the ordinary fineness of seashore sand,\r\nperhaps a trifle coarser, but occasionally much coarser particles or\r\nmasses of particles are found; and in the placer deposits of Anvil\r\nCreek, as in the bunch of claims around “Discovery”--about five miles\r\ndue north of Nome--fragments of the size of lentils are not uncommon.\r\nI have seen full garnets obtained from the wash here which were of the\r\nsize of small peas. Nodules of manganese (manganite, pyrolusite) are at\r\nintervals found with them, and some stream-tin (cassiterite), as in the\r\nKlondike region, also appears to be present. Apart from the evidence\r\nthat is brought down by the magnetite and garnet, it would naturally be\r\nassumed that the gold had its primal source in the mountains back of\r\nthe coast. These, as has already been stated, have undergone exhaustive\r\ndegradation, and the materials resulting from their destruction,\r\nin whatever way brought about, have been thrown into the sea, and\r\nthere adjusted and readjusted--or, so far as the gold particles are\r\nconcerned, one might say “concentrated.” Latterly, and perhaps this is\r\nalso true to-day, the land has undergone elevation, and exposed much\r\nthat until recently properly belonged to the sea. The tundra is a part\r\nof this ocean floor, and it too doubtless contains much gold, perhaps\r\neven very much.\r\n\r\nThe length of the sea strip that was worked during the past summer,\r\nand so far in autumn as the clemency of the weather permitted, covered\r\na nearly continuous thirty or thirty-five miles, extending beyond\r\nSynrock on the west and, with interruptions, to Nome River on the east.\r\nThe full extent of the auriferous sands remains unknown, however, and\r\nreport claims for them reappearances throughout the entire coast as\r\nfar as Cape Prince of Wales. The season’s work gave easy and lucrative\r\nemployment to perhaps fifteen hundred, mostly needy, prospectors, who\r\nrealized on an average certainly not less than fifteen dollars per day,\r\nand many as much as sixty, seventy, and eighty dollars. It is claimed,\r\nand I have little reason to doubt the truthfulness of the statement,\r\nthat from a single rocker, although operated by two men, one hundred\r\nand fifty dollars had been taken out in the course of nine hours’\r\nwork. It is also asserted that two men realized a fortune of thirteen\r\nthousand dollars as the result of their combined season’s work, and\r\ntwo others are said to have rocked out forty-five hundred dollars in\r\nthe period of a month. Women have, to an extent, shared with men the\r\npleasures of “rocking gold from the sea,” and their application in\r\nthe toils of the sea plow, with booted forms, rolled-up sleeves, and\r\nsunbonnets, was certainly an interesting variation on the borders\r\nof the Arctic Circle from the scenes one has grown accustomed to at\r\nAtlantic City or Newport.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ERECTING A STEAM PUMP (NOME).]\r\n\r\nThe placer deposits of the Nome district are in the form of shallow,\r\nlargely or mostly unfrozen gravels, which occupy varying heights,\r\npartly in disrupted or overhanging benches, of the valleys and gulches\r\nwhich trench the slate and limestone mountains. Perhaps the most\r\nfavored ones are those of Anvil and Glacier Creeks (with Snow Gulch\r\nas an affluent of the latter), tributaries of Snake River, and Dexter\r\nCreek, a tributary of Nome River. My time and the conditions of weather\r\npermitted only of a visit to Anvil Creek, and an examination mainly of\r\nthe properties about “Discovery.” The diggings here are all shallow,\r\nfrom four to seven feet, when bed-rock, a steeply pitching and highly\r\nfissile slate, is reached. As before remarked, the gravels are not\r\nfrozen, and thereby present a marked contrast to the condition that\r\nprevails in the Klondike region, and one, it is hardly necessary to\r\nstate, which is eminently to the favor of economy in mining. A layer\r\nof ice, about eight inches in thickness, covers one side of the layers\r\nin claim “No. 1 below,” but beneath this the matrix is again open. In\r\nall these claims the pay-streak was at first reported to be very broad,\r\nbut it seems that the later work has narrowed down the probabilities\r\nof extension very measurably--at any rate, in the condition of a rich\r\nproducer. Of the wealth contained in these claims there is no question,\r\nbut it would probably be straining the truth to say that it is the\r\nequal of that of the best or even the better claims of the Klondike\r\nregion. A two days’ clean-up from “No. 1 below” is reported to have\r\nyielded thirteen thousand dollars, while the entire product of that\r\nclaim from July 26th, when the first wash was made, to September 21st,\r\nwas placed at one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars. Claim “No.\r\n1 above” appears to be equally good, and “Discovery” falls perhaps\r\nnot very far below either. A nugget of the value of three hundred\r\nand twelve dollars--a magnificent specimen, measuring upward of four\r\ninches in length--was obtained from the tailings of “No. 1 below”; a\r\nlarger one, of the value of four hundred and thirty-four dollars, is\r\nto the credit of “No. 1 above.” It is interesting to note that these\r\nrich claims are located at the very issuance of Anvil Creek from the\r\nmountains--i. e., at the contact with the upper rise of the tundra--and\r\nother good properties are found still lower down, a condition which\r\nmakes it certain that the inner reaches of the tundra, whatever the\r\nwhole tundra may be, must yield largely in gold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “DIGGING” THE SEASHORE SANDS FOR GOLD.]\r\n\r\nThe city of Nome itself might properly be termed a model of production.\r\nBefore the end of June, 1899, there was practically nothing on its\r\npresent site; in early July it was still a place of tents, but by\r\nthe middle of September it had blossomed out into a constructed town\r\nof three to four thousand inhabitants, more than one half of whom\r\nwere properly housed in well-built cabins, the lumber for which was\r\nin part brought from a distance of two thousand miles, and none of\r\nit from less than one hundred miles. Numerous stores and saloons had\r\narranged themselves on both sides of a well-defined street (which was\r\nhere and there centrally interrupted by building transgressions), the\r\nfamiliar signs of dancing and boxing bouts were displayed in front of\r\nmore than comfortably filled faro and roulette establishments, and\r\nin a general way the site wore the aspect of riding a boom swell.\r\nAnd indeed there was plenty of activity, for the final weeks of fine\r\nweather warned of the impending wintry snows and blasts, and much had\r\nto be done individually to shield one from these and other discomforts.\r\nThere was at that time a threatening shortage in building material,\r\nand fears were expressed for those who seemingly would be obliged\r\nto spend the winter months--a dreary expanse of nearly one half the\r\nyear, with hurricane blasts of icy wind blowing with a velocity of\r\nfifty to eighty miles an hour, and under the not very comfortable\r\ntemperature of -40° to -60° F.--in the frail shelter of tents. How\r\nmany, if any, remained in this condition can not now be known. Much\r\ndriftwood and some coal had been secured by many of the more fortunate\r\ninhabitants, and it is possible that some provision has been made by\r\nwhich everybody of the two or three thousand wintering inhabitants\r\nwill receive a proper measure of heating substance, without which the\r\nutmost discomfort must prevail. The last coal before my departure sold\r\nfor seventy-five dollars per ton, but I suspect that later importations\r\nmust have realized the better part of double this amount. In early\r\nOctober flour could still be purchased for seven to eight dollars per\r\nsack, and meat for a dollar a pound, but these prices were run up\r\nvery materially in the period of the next two weeks. Good meals were\r\nonly a dollar, and fractions of meals could be had for twenty-five\r\nand fifty cents. Magnificent oranges were only a quarter apiece, and\r\nwatermelons four and five dollars. All these prices were, at the\r\nleast, doubled before the first week in November, when the locality\r\nwas finally cut off from contact with the rest of the civilized world.\r\nThe principal commercial houses doing trade in Alaska--as the Alaska\r\nCommercial Company, the North American Trading and Transportation\r\nCompany, the Alaska Exploration Company, all of which, besides others,\r\nhave their agencies in Dawson and at various stations on the Yukon\r\nRiver--have well-constructed, iron-sheathed warehouses, and carry large\r\nlines of goods. The energy which in so short a period has planted\r\nthese interests here, and in so substantial a manner, is certainly\r\nastonishing. Who a year ago could have expected that the needs of a\r\nresident population situated close under the Arctic Circle, and along\r\nthe inhospitable shores of Bering Sea, would have demanded depots of\r\nsale of the size of those that one finds in cities of importance in the\r\ncivilized South?\r\n\r\nNome prints to-day three newspapers, the first issue of the first\r\njournal, the Nome News, appearing about the 10th of October. Its\r\nselling price was twenty-five cents. Up to the time of my leaving,\r\nthere were no serious disturbances of any kind, but indications of\r\ntrouble, resulting from the disputed rights of possession, whether in\r\nthe form of squatter sovereignty or of purchase, were ominously in the\r\nair, and it was feared that should serious trouble of any kind arise,\r\nneither the military nor civil authorities would be in a position\r\nto properly cope with it. It was freely admitted that the community\r\nwas not under the law that so strongly forces order in Dawson and\r\nthe Klondike region. Much more to be feared than disturbance, for at\r\nleast the first season, is the possibility of conflagration; closely\r\npacked as are the tents and shacks, with no available water supply for\r\ncombating flames, a headway of fire can not but be a serious menace\r\nto the entire location, and one which is in no way lessened through\r\nthe general indraught of hurricane winds. The experiences of Dawson\r\nshould have furnished a lesson, but they have seemingly not done so,\r\nnor has apparently the average inhabitant profited in any effort to\r\nward off the malignant influences arising from hard living, unnecessary\r\nexposure to the inclemencies of the weather, and a non-hygienic diet.\r\nHence, typhoid or typho-malarial disease, even if not in a very\r\npronounced form, has already sown its seeds of destruction, and warns\r\nof the dangers which here, as in Dawson, man brings to himself in his\r\ncustomary contempt for the working of Nature’s laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STATE OFFICIAL ON EXCESSIVE TAXATION.\r\n\r\nBY FRANKLIN SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not to government reports that a student of social science looks\r\nfor warnings against the perils lurking in the enormous expenditures\r\nand the extraordinary enlargement of the duties of the state. Officials\r\nare usually so deeply impressed with the importance of their positions\r\nand so anxious to magnify the worth of their labors that they are prone\r\nto take the rosiest view of any part of the great clanking machine\r\nintrusted to their care. With the keenest pride they point to their\r\nachievements in furthering the work of human welfare. If modesty does\r\nnot restrain them, they are certain to paint, with an artless faith\r\nin their own abilities, the still greater work that could be done\r\nwith a slight increase of funds and a little more assistance. Not all\r\nofficials, however, permit themselves to indulge in the natural vanity\r\nof bureaucrats. They refuse either to be blinded to the perpetual\r\nfailure of state-made civilization, or to deceive the impoverished\r\nvictims of the same costly system of modern magic. Of the very few of\r\nthis class Mr. James H. Roberts, for five years Comptroller of the\r\nState of New York,[A] is perhaps the most conspicuous. Astray as he is\r\non the question of a graded inheritance tax, and trustful as he is in\r\nthe virtue of State supervision, he puts himself beyond criticism in\r\nhis opposition to the policy of State socialism, now the rage at home\r\nand abroad. Indeed, no one could hold it up to graver reproach.\r\n\r\n    [A] He was in office from January 1, 1894, to January 1, 1899.\r\n\r\nWhenever an observer of the signs of the times in the United States\r\nventures to say that they offer little food for hope, he is branded as\r\npessimistic or unpatriotic. He is told that if he had the confidence\r\nin democratic institutions of a man with a good digestion and a fair\r\nintelligence, he would know that they possess a vitality, a power of\r\nrejuvenation, that does not belong to an autocracy nor an aristocracy.\r\nIf he is particularly despondent, and seeks to justify himself with\r\nfact and argument, he is denounced as a dangerous agitator, or, what\r\nis a shade more odious, as an absurd _doctrinaire_. But Mr. Roberts\r\nhas not been consigned to any such depths of contempt. He is known\r\nas a “hard-headed business man,” a title of honor that always frees\r\nthe most ridiculous optimist from any suspicion of the theorist or\r\nsentimentalist. Yet, as the supervisor of the finances of a great\r\nState, he was brought in contact with a mass of phenomena that forced\r\nupon him the conviction that something is wrong, and that if it is not\r\nrighted it will bring disaster. Indeed, I do not recall a pessimist,\r\nhowever dyspeptic, nor a _doctrinaire_, however visionary, that has\r\nstruck a more melancholy note than he. In all his reports much will\r\nbe found that indicates anything but a belief that a democracy that\r\nplunders and enslaves a people is any better than any other despotism\r\nguilty of the same offense, or that the practice in the one case will\r\nbe productive of greater prosperity and happiness than in the other.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in the report for 1897 that Mr. Roberts gives the\r\nfullest expression to his apprehensions. “This country,” he says\r\nin an elaborate argument for a graded inheritance tax, which he\r\nbelieved would bring some relief to the poor and discontented, “has\r\njust passed through the most threatening political campaign in its\r\nhistory. The portents in 1896 were vastly more dangerous than those of\r\n1860, when peace and internecine war hung in the balance. Issues were\r\nadvanced last year, and vigorously supported by a large element of the\r\nAmerican electorate, which, if adopted, would have undermined the very\r\nfoundations of American institutions. These issues were largely the\r\noutgrowth of discontent among the people. The farmer, as a class, the\r\nwork people, and the small trade folk were in distress.... Hundreds\r\nof thousands of industrious people were out of employment, the best\r\nefforts of the farmer had been attended with poor results, and the\r\nsmall tradesman and business man were worse off than if they had been\r\ndoing nothing.” In the report for the following year he spoke again of\r\nthe “public discontent and dissatisfaction with existing conditions\r\nin this State.” Instead of joining the comfortable and contented in a\r\ndenunciation of them as a delusion, born of envy or criminal instincts,\r\nhe expressed the opinion that they had a very substantial basis. “My\r\nfour years of close official study of the State finances,” he says,\r\n“compels me to say there is serious ground for complaint.” After giving\r\nan impressive summary in another place of the enormous increase of\r\npublic expenditures within recent years he is moved to ask, “Whither\r\nare we drifting?”\r\n\r\nThe answer commonly given to this question is one quite flattering\r\nto American vanity. It is that we are drifting away from “parochial”\r\nthings and taking our proper place as a great “world power.” Having\r\nsolved all the petty problems that have absorbed our thoughts and\r\nenergies for a hundred years, we have gone forth to “take up the white\r\nman’s burden,” and to solve the greater problems that a discriminating\r\nProvidence has so wisely confided to our ability and philanthropy. At\r\nthe same time we are going to have our say as to how the affairs of\r\nthe world outside of our narrow and cramping borders shall be managed.\r\nMr. Roberts, however, does not appear to take any such pleasant view\r\nof the future. He has none of the blood of Don Quixote flowing in his\r\nveins. The bestowal of the blessings of a Christian civilization with\r\nmachine guns upon breech-clouted savages has no attractions for him. He\r\nsees that we have made such a disgraceful failure of the management of\r\nthe contemptible things in which we have been so ignobly absorbed that\r\nwe are threatened with national decadence! “While the contests against\r\nunjust and oppressive taxation,” he says in his report for 1899, “have\r\nbeen the contests of freedom and civil and religious liberty in the\r\nworld, it must not be forgotten that unjust and burdensome taxation\r\nhas been in all ages the most prolific cause of national decadence\r\nas well. There are nations in Europe, once great and prosperous,” he\r\nadds, thus recalling the warnings of Lord Salisbury’s famous speech\r\non the same subject, “which to-day seem dying of dry rot because, to\r\nmeet their immense expenses and to pay interest on their great bonded\r\ndebts, taxation has been increased beyond the safe limit, and the very\r\nsources of national prosperity have been taxed so that they run dry,\r\nor send down a rill where it should be a river. Few national diseases\r\nare more dangerous or harder to cure than burdensome taxation. Can\r\nany one charged with the responsibility of making tax laws,” he asks,\r\nprofoundly stirred by the startling facts that have come under his\r\nobservation, “afford to ignore the undoubted lessons of history or the\r\nmanifest tendency of the times in the matter of revenue raising and\r\nexpending?”\r\n\r\nObvious as is the fitting answer to this question, it is one that few\r\npeople stop to give. Both the lessons of history and the tendency\r\nof the times are willfully and incessantly ignored. Not only are\r\nthey ignored by demagogues, who thrive most when public distress is\r\ngreatest, and by misguided philanthropists, who seek to relieve it in\r\nways that only intensify it. Even publicists, whose studies in history\r\nought to make them more familiar with the signs of social decadence\r\nthan a man of affairs with vision less extended, ignore them also. They\r\nseem to be as insensible to the real significance of what is going\r\non before their eyes as the wooden totems of a burning tepee. But to\r\nminds more alert and penetrating, even if less congested with musty\r\nlore and fine intentions, the flight of the farming population to the\r\ncities is something besides “a great natural movement toward urban life\r\nthat accompanies an advance in civilization”--it is a desperate but\r\nfutile attempt to escape conditions that have become too hard to be\r\nborne. The swarms of impoverished and degraded humanity that crowd the\r\nslums to suffocation are not altogether the product of willful sloth\r\nand incapacity; they are due, in a measure, to the growing taxation\r\nthat has wiped out the narrow margin that separates independence\r\nfrom dependence--self-support and self-respect from destitution and\r\npauperism. The hatred of the rich, the denunciation of capital, the\r\ncontempt for the Church, the bloody insurrections of labor, the\r\ngeneral feeling of rancor, accompanied by an increase of the tyranny\r\nof trades unions and government regulations, are not the inevitable\r\nmanifestations of envy, ignorance, and criminal instincts; they are\r\nthe inevitable fruits of the perpetual aggressions in a thousand forms\r\nthat spring from politics and war. But instead of acting upon this\r\nnatural interpretation of the signs of the times and seeking to solve\r\nthe social problem in the only way that it can be solved, the “new”\r\nreformers tormenting the world are engaged in the invention of schemes\r\nthat add to the public burdens and hasten the nation’s decay.\r\n\r\nThe reckless expenditure of public money in the United States has\r\nnot been confined to any particular political division nor to any\r\nparticular geographical section. The national, State, and municipal\r\ngovernments have seemed to vie with one another in the plunder of the\r\ntaxpayer. From the North, the South, the East, and the West have come\r\nthe same complaints of excessive burdens.[B] But figures are needed to\r\ngive these statements the vividness of reality. Beginning with national\r\nexpenditures, Mr. Roberts says that during the decade from 1820 to 1830\r\nthey were $1.07 per capita; from 1851 to 1861, they were $2.06; and for\r\nthe year 1894, $6.08. “In a word,” he adds, “the per capita expense of\r\nthe national Government in 1894 was nearly six times as great as it\r\nwas in 1820, and nearly three times as great as it was in the decade\r\nbefore our great civil war.” The per capita expenditures of the State\r\nof New York in 1830 were $1.30, thirty years later they were $1.89, in\r\n1890 they were $2.15, and “in 1897 the estimated per capita expenditure\r\nreached the alarming amount of $4.95.” That is to say, the combined\r\nexpenditures of the State and national governments gave a rate as high\r\nas that prevailing in France before the outbreak of the Revolution.\r\n“The tendency to increase,” says Mr. Roberts, commenting on these\r\nfigures, “is a persistent one. In 1881 the amount expended by the State\r\nwas $9,878,214.59; in 1884, $10,479,517.31; in 1887, $14,301,102.48;\r\nin 1890, $13,076,881.86; in 1893, $17,367,335.98; and in 1896,\r\n$20,020,022.47.” Coming to municipal expenditures, where the hand of\r\nthe prodigal has been most lavish, Mr. Roberts says that “between 1860\r\nand 1880 the municipal debts of our Union increased from $100,000,000\r\nto $682,000,000, and in fifteen cities, believed to represent the\r\naverage, the increase in taxation was 362.2 per cent, while the\r\nincrease in taxable valuation was but 156.9 per cent, and of population\r\nbut 70 per cent. In the year 1860 the direct taxes for State, county,\r\ntown, and city purposes in New York were $4.90 per capita, in 1880 it\r\nwas $8.20, and in 1896 it had reached $10.43, an increase in thirty-six\r\nyears of 213 per cent.” It should be added that the bonded debt--State,\r\ncounty, city, town, village, and school district--in the State is\r\nestimated by Mr. Roberts to be $450,000,000. Is it any wonder that\r\npeople so mercilessly plundered feel that the times are out of joint?\r\nIs it any wonder, either, that in 1896 Mr. Roberts was moved to say\r\nthat, without the discovery of new sources of revenue, “a low tax rate\r\nwould never again be enjoyed in this State”? Is it any wonder, finally,\r\nthat he declared again that if “we have not yet passed the danger limit\r\nof taxation,” we have reached “a point where there is a deep feeling of\r\nunrest and dissatisfaction, and where a halt should be called or there\r\nwill be danger”?\r\n\r\n    [B] From the mass of proofs of this statement in my possession\r\n        I will select only one. In a call for a convention at\r\n        Portland, Me., on the 10th of June last, of all persons\r\n        “interested in the revision of the present system of State\r\n        taxation and a more economical management of the State\r\n        affairs,” it is stated that “the expenses of the State\r\n        have increased fifty per cent in ten years, while the\r\n        wealth and population of the State have steadily declined.”\r\n        The object of the convention was “to protest against the\r\n        course of extravagance that is rapidly bringing reproach\r\n        upon the government of the State and reducing the farmers\r\n        and taxpayers to automatons to grind out revenue to be\r\n        absorbed by a rapacious and ever-multiplying horde of\r\n        office-holders, who devour the people’s substance as fast\r\n        as they produce it.” After showing how “once prosperous\r\n        farming towns and townships have been reduced to but\r\n        little better than a howling wilderness,” the call says\r\n        in conclusion: “These once prosperous farming communities\r\n        were redeemed from the native wilderness by men who were\r\n        no more temperate, industrious, or economical than the\r\n        farmers of to-day, and the prices they received for their\r\n        products were as low as, and in some instances lower than,\r\n        to-day, but the fruits of their honest toil were not drawn\r\n        from them as fast as acquired by national, State, county,\r\n        and, in many instances, by municipal extravagance, as it\r\n        is to-day.” The plundered peasantry of Spain, Italy, or\r\n        Russia, army ridden as they are, could not have made a more\r\n        just complaint.\r\n\r\nThe stock explanation of this growth of expenditure is that with\r\nthe advance of civilization the cost of government must increase in\r\nlike degree; there must be more regulation and supervision of the\r\nactivities becoming more numerous and complex. But this means, if it\r\nmeans anything, that the more enlightened and humane people are, the\r\nmore difficult it is to maintain order and enforce justice, the more\r\ninclined are they to attack and plunder one another--in a word, the\r\nmore barbarous they are. Preposterous as this theory of civilization\r\nis, it is precisely the one upon which the American people are acting\r\nwith unparalleled energy. While we should naturally think them moving\r\ntoward a point where they could get along without government, they are\r\nmoving toward a point where they will have nothing but government.\r\nReferring to the increase of expenditures already mentioned, Mr.\r\nRoberts says it “corresponds almost exactly with the increase of\r\nthe number of commissions and departments.... These departments and\r\ncommissions,” he continues, “are largely for the purpose of extending\r\nsocial supervision and regulation over many things which, in the\r\nearlier days of our Commonwealth, were left to the localities or to\r\nself-regulation.” Again he says: “The amount of State inspection\r\nhas become very great, reaching out constantly over new fields, and\r\nemploying in the aggregate an army of inspectors.... The system of\r\n_laissez faire_, which was the rallying cry of democracy and free\r\ngovernment at the beginning of the century, has yielded gradually to a\r\nsystem of supervision and control which monarchies never attempted....\r\nWhat our State has done in this line can not probably be undone,” he\r\nsays in a repetition of his warning, “but this tendency to expand\r\nand multiply and differentiate and segregate State supervision and\r\nregulation must cease, or the burden will soon become too grievous to\r\nbe borne.”\r\n\r\nBut there is no warrant for the assumption that the more civilized we\r\nare--that is, the greater our self-control--the more are we in need\r\nof inspection and regulation. Such an explanation of the enormous\r\nincrease in public expenditure is worthless. The true explanation lies\r\nin the greed of politicians and the delusion of social reformers. To\r\nboth of these causes must be attributed the evils that Mr. Roberts\r\ndeplores. “The truth of history,” he says, referring to the thirty-six\r\nnew offices and commissions created since 1880, “compels the statement\r\nthat it looks as if many of these creations were made not so much to\r\nsatisfy a public want as to relieve a political situation.” That is\r\nto say, they were designed to provide spoils for the insatiable maw\r\nof politicians. One of the most flagrant examples of this popular\r\nmethod of forwarding the beneficent work of civilization and hastening\r\nthe dawn of the millennium is the State Board of Mediation and\r\nArbitration, created in 1886. Up to the present year it has cost the\r\ntaxpayers $195,828.57. For this expenditure little can be shown but a\r\nshelf full of reports seldom read, and a pigeon hole of vouchers for\r\nsalaries never earned. With one of the former members of this board,\r\nwho served thirteen years and received $39,000 for his able services,\r\nI am personally acquainted. Of my own knowledge, I can say that for\r\nnearly three years at least his duties as commissioner never interfered\r\nperceptibly with his duties as editor. That most of the other offices\r\nand commissions are equally worthless there can be no doubt. Altogether\r\nthey have cost the State the startling sum of $31,768,899.85, and are\r\nincreasing the public burdens at the rate of more than $1,000,000 a\r\nyear. But their true character as asylums for decayed politicians,\r\nor as stepping stones for ambitious young ones, and at all times\r\nas centers of political intrigue and personal profit, is gradually\r\ndawning upon the public. Already several Governors have demanded, in\r\ntheir annual messages to the Legislature, that they be consolidated\r\nor abolished. As yet, however, it has been impossible to relax their\r\ngrip on the taxpayer. Obedient to the instincts of their kind, they are\r\ninventing new arguments to establish their claims to the confidence and\r\ngratitude of the victims of their greed and incompetency.\r\n\r\nBut the creation of new and needless offices is not the only\r\nmanifestation of what Mr. Roberts fitly calls “the vicious tendencies\r\nof legislation.” More demoralizing are the laws that actually encourage\r\nthe robbery of one class of people for the benefit of another. A\r\nfamiliar example is the bounty law for the destruction of fishing\r\nnets. Almost as soon as passed it produced a new industry--namely, the\r\nmanufacture of cheap nets, which were deposited in fishing waters,\r\nsubsequently discovered and seized by a pre-arrangement, and made the\r\nbasis of demands upon the public treasury out of proportion to their\r\nvalue. So great have been the frauds perpetrated under it that the\r\ncry for its repeal comes from every quarter. Another law even worse\r\nmorally was passed to meet the clamor of the bicyclists and bicycle\r\nmanufacturers. It provides that twenty-five per cent of the cost of\r\nso-called good roads to be built under it shall be paid by the State.\r\nAs cities and villages are exempt from its provisions, this sum, which\r\ncomes out of the pockets of all taxpayers, urban as well as rural, is,\r\nas Mr. Roberts says, simply “a gratuity to the towns for the benefit\r\nof country roads.” As a sign of the moral decadence of the times, I\r\nought to add that one of the most powerful and effective arguments in\r\nfavor of the law was this very discrimination. Still more shameless\r\nwas one of the chief arguments in favor of the Raines liquor law. With\r\na moral callousness truly astounding, its advocates framed tables of\r\nfigures to show how great a percentage of taxation it would shift from\r\nthe country to the city districts. In the heated political campaign\r\nthat followed, these tables were made to do service again to save from\r\ndefeat the party responsible for the enactment. To indicate, finally,\r\nhow legislation may encourage vice, I must not omit to mention the\r\nprovision that created the Raines hotel. Under it assignation houses\r\nhave multiplied to a degree that Satan himself could not have foreseen\r\nnor have been more enchanted with.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest inroads on the pockets of the taxpayer have been\r\nmade under the pretense of charity. I say “pretense” because it is a\r\ngross misuse of language to decorate with so fine a word the seizure\r\nof a man’s property under the forms of law and to devote it to the\r\nostensible relief of want and suffering. It is the infliction of an\r\naggression that has no more warrant in a court of sound morals than the\r\nseizure of his property in disregard of the forms of law. Yet this evil\r\nhas reached such vast proportions that Mr. Roberts was moved to protest\r\nagainst it. After speaking of “the tendency of the State in building up\r\na gigantic system” that “will call for an enormous and ever-increasing\r\nannual expenditure for maintenance,” he expressed the belief in 1896\r\nthat “the time has come to call a halt before this burden of taxation\r\nbecomes too heavy.” He then mentioned the significant fact that while\r\nthe State spent $6,000,000 for charity, $4,800,000 for public schools,\r\n$800,000 for the militia, it spent only $500,000 for judges’ salaries!\r\nHe pointed out also that the expenditures under the head of charity had\r\nincreased from $1,468,471.58 in 1887 to $5,888,193.74 in 1897, or over\r\nfour hundred per cent in ten years. He added the prophecy that it would\r\nbe “a matter of a short time only when the annual expenditures for\r\ncharity alone in this State will reach $10,000,000.” At that time five\r\nlarge State charitable institutions were in process of construction,\r\nand were soon to be thrown open to the public. In the following year\r\nhe reverted to the subject in still stronger terms. “God forbid,” he\r\nsays, “that I should put a straw in the way of charity rationally\r\ndirected; but my four years’ experience as comptroller ... compels me\r\nto say that charity is dispensed in this State with an almost lavish\r\nhand, and in my judgment it is in many cases unwisely dispensed.” In\r\nhis last report to the Legislature the aggregate cost of the fourteen\r\ngreat institutions in operation, with a population of 6,621, is put at\r\n$6,898,304.52.\r\n\r\nThat this enormous largess, wrested from the taxpayers without the\r\nslightest consideration for their own wants and sufferings, is unwisely\r\ndispensed in many cases Mr. Roberts furnishes the amplest proof. The\r\ncharges that he brings against this form of State activity are most\r\nserious. They reveal the same odious traits that characterize the\r\nmanagement of public affairs in no wise connected with the love of\r\nhumanity. “Nearly every locality,” says Mr. Roberts, “having a State\r\ncharitable institution deals with it as though it were established\r\nto afford that locality an avenue through which to reach the State\r\ntreasury, and in most cases, where a majority of the managers live\r\nunder or are dominated by local influence, the avenue has been\r\nprofitably traveled. The result of such predominance is combination\r\namong local dealers, a division of the furnishing of the supplies among\r\nthem at greatly advanced prices, the palming off upon the institution\r\nof inferior articles which would find no sale in the market, a row\r\nwith the superintendent if he undertakes to expend money outside of\r\nthe locality, and, through friction and disturbance, the work of the\r\ninstitution is more or less demoralized.” He charges that “the only\r\naim” of some institutions “seems to be the expenditure of their entire\r\nappropriation, irrespective of the number of inmates provided for or\r\nthe results obtained.” Putting the same charge in another way, he says\r\nthat “the cost of an institution is more frequently based upon the\r\namount of the appropriation granted by the Legislature than upon its\r\nreal or apparent necessities.” When it is remembered that the managers\r\nof the institutions against whom these astonishing charges are brought\r\nare picked people, representing much more than the average character\r\nand ability, the conclusion is not unnatural that ward heelers and\r\ncaucus packers have no monopoly of the rotten ethics of politics.\r\n\r\nIf we look a little further into the management of the institutions,\r\nall the familiar footprints of the unscrupulous politician become\r\nvisible. Money appropriated for specific purposes is diverted from\r\nthem. Over fifty-five per cent of the amount expended in 1898 under\r\nspecial appropriations was used for the benefit of two institutions,\r\nleaving less than forty-five per cent for the remaining fourteen.\r\nPlans for new buildings or the improvement of old are so changed as to\r\nrequire an expenditure considerably in excess of the money appropriated\r\nfor the purpose. Not infrequently the excess ranges from twenty-five to\r\nfifty per cent, and thus the way is paved for further appeals to the\r\nLegislature to meet the dishonest deficits. A more reprehensible use\r\nof public money is appropriations for new buildings and improvements\r\nof old ones belonging to private institutions. As examples, Mr.\r\nRoberts cites the expenditure of $77,473 upon the private property of\r\nthe Malone Institute for Deaf-Mutes, and $457,556 upon that of the\r\nRandall’s Island Reformatory. “In my judgment,” he says, expressing an\r\nopinion that every fair-minded person will approve, “this is a mistaken\r\npublic policy. If these institutions are to be steady recipients of\r\nState aid for permanent improvements, the title of the property should\r\nbe transferred to the State.” Otherwise any philanthropist might found\r\na charitable institution to provide himself with congenial employment,\r\nand, availing himself of the courtesy of the State to thrust his hands\r\ninto the pockets of his neighbors, make additions to it and keep it in\r\nrepair.\r\n\r\nBut these are by no means the only ways that money picked from the\r\npockets of taxpayers is poured into the bottomless pit of State\r\nphilanthropy. One of the most common and most expensive is the\r\nunjustifiable increase of salaries. In 1894 and 1895, when the country\r\nwas still in the throes of the great panic of 1893 and when hundreds\r\nof thousands of people were glad to get work at almost any pay, the\r\nsalary list of nine charitable institutions was increased forty\r\nthousand dollars a year. Indefensible variations in the per capita cost\r\nof practically the same service discloses another mode of waste. Mr.\r\nRoberts gives elaborate tables in exposure of this evil. While the per\r\ncapita cost of the inmates of the Western House of Refuge for Women at\r\nAlbion is $254.27, that of the inmates of the House of Refuge for Women\r\nat Hudson is $217.63. Again, while the per capita cost of the inmates\r\nof the State Industrial School at Rochester is $219.49, that of the\r\ninmates of the Reformatory on Randall’s Island is $210.59. Still again,\r\nwhile the per capita cost of the inmates of the State School for the\r\nBlind at Batavia is $313.74, that of the inmates of the Northern New\r\nYork Institute for Deaf-Mutes at Malone is $258.36. If it be remembered\r\nthat the institutions on Randall’s Island and at Malone are under\r\nprivate management, the lower rate prevailing there, compared with the\r\nhigher rate at the Batavia and Rochester institutions, suggest a fact\r\nof no slight significance. “Private institutions,” says Mr. Roberts,\r\ncalling attention to it, “are only paid in some instances $110 per\r\nannum for the care and support of inmates, ... while the cost in State\r\ninstitutions is more than $200 per annum.” Yet, despite the possible\r\nindefinite multiplication of such facts, the “new” reformer pins his\r\nfaith to the State as a fit agent for the regeneration of his fellows.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving these institutions I must call attention to another\r\ncharacteristic form of waste. I refer to the delicacies furnished to\r\nthe officials and inmates. “It has not seemed exactly right,” says\r\nMr. Roberts, setting forth the scandal in very moderate terms, “that\r\nthe taxpayers of the State should be required to pay for Blue Points,\r\nlobster, terrapin, frogs’ legs, partridge, quail, venison, and most of\r\nthe delicacies of the season to supply the tables of officials already\r\nwell paid and well housed by the State.” But solicitude about table\r\neconomies was never known to be a trait of bureaucratic parasites. They\r\nnever trouble themselves to prolong their vision to the meager tables\r\nof the poor and suffering robbed of the necessaries of life to load\r\ntheirs with luxuries. The same limited vision is exhibited on holidays\r\nin their generosity at other people’s expense. “Is it fair,” says Mr.\r\nRoberts, protesting against this touching display of human goodness,\r\n“that the average workingman should wear poor clothes and live on plain\r\nfare in order that he may bring up his family decently and honestly,\r\nwhile the inmates of State institutions are indulged with turkey at\r\neighteen cents a pound, footballs at $4.83 each, oranges, candy, nuts,\r\nice cream, and expensive luxuries?... It must not be forgotten,” he\r\nadds, mentioning a truth commonly forgotten even by people that have\r\nreached a higher civilization than that of the average State official,\r\n“that the money spent for these inmates is not voluntary contribution,\r\nbut is the product of enforced taxation.”[C]\r\n\r\n    [C] But I ought to add that this mismanagement of State\r\n        charitable institutions is duplicated in the management\r\n        of other State departments that came under Mr. Roberts’s\r\n        observation. Although more than $24,000,000 have been\r\n        spent on the new Capitol, it proves to be too small\r\n        for the purposes it was designed to meet. Mr. Roberts\r\n        recommends the conversion of the old State Hall into a\r\n        finance building. The State Library has become so large\r\n        that it will soon require a separate building. The racing\r\n        tax law was so bunglingly framed that the collections\r\n        under it in 1896 were attended with “more difficulty and\r\n        expense than usual.” As the forest-preserve law stood in\r\n        1896, it permitted people purchasing State lands to strip\r\n        them of lumber, and then, owing to certain irregularities\r\n        connected with the sale, making it illegal, to recover the\r\n        money originally paid with interest at six and seven per\r\n        cent added. Because of the absence of any law covering\r\n        the personal expenditures of members of legislative\r\n        investigating committees, claims for seven and eight\r\n        dollars a day are rendered, although four or five dollars\r\n        a day are believed to be ample. Let me add that these\r\n        investigations, which, during the period from 1879 to 1896\r\n        inclusive, cost $823,534.51, reveal another source of\r\n        waste from State management. Still another source of waste\r\n        is State printing. Pointing out the “growing expenses of\r\n        State printing,” Mr. Roberts shows that they have increased\r\n        from $95,029.51 in 1887 to $315,585.81 in 1896. At one time\r\n        the law was so defective that it was impossible to frame\r\n        specifications for bids that would allow for printing of\r\n        different kinds. For example, blanks varying from two to\r\n        three inches square to two and three feet had to be classed\r\n        in the same schedule and price. A needless quantity of\r\n        reports is printed. Some of them are printed in the highest\r\n        style of the art and richly embellished with expensive\r\n        plates and engravings. One report for 1895 cost $42,000,\r\n        and others cost as high as $20,000 and $30,000. “It does\r\n        not seem logical,” says Mr. Roberts, commenting on this\r\n        extravagance, “to spend as much on the illustration of a\r\n        report as it costs for clerk hire in many departments.”\r\n        Another evil is the failure of the Legislature to\r\n        appropriate money enough to meet the printing bills each\r\n        year, thus making it necessary either to borrow money to\r\n        pay them or to compel the printer to wait for his pay\r\n        at a loss of interest on the amount due him. In this\r\n        connection attention must be called to the failure of the\r\n        Legislature to provide money enough to cover expenditures\r\n        during the period intervening before funds are available\r\n        from taxation. Although Mr. Roberts recommended repeatedly\r\n        legislation for the avoidance of this difficulty, which\r\n        causes waste, no attention was paid to him. The management\r\n        of court and trust funds by county treasurers has been\r\n        particularly scandalous. In disregard of the express\r\n        direction of the courts, thousands of dollars were retained\r\n        by parties or their attorneys for their own personal\r\n        benefit. Money has been paid out by county treasurers\r\n        without certified orders of the courts merely upon the\r\n        assurance of attorneys that the payments were proper. The\r\n        rules framed by the comptroller in regard to this matter\r\n        were constantly disregarded. Excessive allowances were made\r\n        for costs of attorneys. In the case of one estate of $750,\r\n        thus robbed, only $60 remained for the payment of the debts\r\n        against it. By the defalcations of county treasurers, court\r\n        and trust funds are often depleted, and the beneficiaries,\r\n        often widows, orphans, and unfortunate litigants, are\r\n        robbed. Mr. Roberts has recommended legislation on this\r\n        subject, but no attention, as far as I know, has been paid\r\n        to it. It is one of those “parochial” questions that the\r\n        American people appear to have no taste for. But it would\r\n        seem as if the protection of citizens, especially the poor\r\n        and weak, was the first duty of the State.\r\n\r\nResistance to aggression is one of the fundamental instincts of the\r\nhuman race. It has been enforced during countless ages by the penalty\r\nof extermination. Only the people that refuse to be killed, or robbed\r\nand enslaved, which are modified forms of the same crime, can respond\r\nto a scriptural injunction; they alone can be fruitful, multiply, and\r\nreplenish the earth. All others must succumb to the pitiless law of the\r\nsurvival of the fittest. Efforts to escape taxation not sanctioned by\r\njustice, so common throughout the United States, are not, therefore,\r\nexhibitions of hopeless depravity; they are exhibitions of the natural\r\ndesire for self-preservation that demands study and heed.\r\n\r\nIn New York State the efforts of taxpayers to escape this increasing\r\naggression have had a deplorable effect. To still the voice of\r\ndiscontent and complaint, legislators have tried to lay on their\r\nburdens as lightly as possible. Acting upon a familiar definition\r\nof taxation, they have tried to pluck the goose so as to get the\r\nmost feathers with the least squawk. But in their observance of the\r\nprinciples of humanity they have shown but slight regard for the\r\nprinciples of economics or justice. Mr. Roberts characterizes their\r\nenactments as “confused, illogical, and conflicting”; he adds that they\r\nare “nearly all legislative makeshifts, and many of them blunders.”\r\nThe moral effect of the aggression has, however, been more disastrous\r\nthan either the economic or statutory. To escape it, the owners of\r\nevery class of property, no matter what their intelligence, their\r\nreligious professions, or their social standing, resort to every\r\npossible subterfuge. With the cries of the tortured fowl ringing in\r\nsympathetic ears, complaisant officials refuse to assess real estate,\r\nas required by law, at its full value. “The assessor,” says Mr.\r\nRoberts, describing this form of evasion and its evil consequences,\r\n“undertakes, by reducing valuations on his own responsibility and in\r\ndefiance of law, to protect his own county or town from paying more\r\nthan its fair proportion of tax, and self-interest lulls the moral\r\nsense of the community into support of his action.” The same law of\r\nassessment applies to the whole State, yet there are twenty-five rates\r\nof assessment in the sixty counties, and these rates range from fifty\r\nto ninety-two per cent of the value of the land. The owners of personal\r\nproperty avoid their obligations in a manner still more reprehensible.\r\nThey either conceal it or lie about it. While its amount during the\r\npast forty years has reached the enormous total of $18,000,000,000,\r\nor more than four times the value of the real estate, its assessed\r\nvalue has not increased. It is Mr. Roberts’s conviction, based upon\r\n“study and observation,” that not “more than three per cent” of it\r\nis assessed. The result is that, although real estate pays a revenue\r\nof over $9,000,000 a year, personal property pays one of only about\r\n$1,000,000. As to the corporations, they are equally alert in avoiding\r\ntheir obligations. Before the enactment of a recent law they did it by\r\nwatering their stocks and issuing bonds, thus creating an indebtedness\r\nequal to their capital. They do it now by incorporating in other States\r\nand carrying on business in this State. They do it also by neglecting\r\nfor a certain time to make the reports required by law, and then taking\r\nrefuge behind the statute of limitations. If the burdens thrust upon\r\nthem can not be shirked or borne, they fly to other States, where the\r\naggressions of the tax collector are less ruinous.\r\n\r\nTo compel officials to do their duty, countless expedients have been\r\ninvented from time immemorial. In the face of proof mountains high that\r\nno legislative or administrative device can uproot the selfishness\r\nimbedded in human nature or reshape the conduct molded to this\r\nimmutable fact, social quacks still continue to spawn their schemes\r\nto work the miracle. Slight as is Mr. Roberts’s sympathy with them,\r\nhe is no exception. As a panacea for the dishonesty and incompetency\r\nof the county treasurers that mismanage court and trust funds, he\r\nrecommends the substitution of State for local inspection. By a similar\r\napplication of hocus-pocus, he would transmute the extravagance of the\r\nmanagers of charitable institutions into exemplary economy. Disgusted\r\nwith the charlatans in charge of certain duties connected with these\r\ninstitutions requiring special skill and knowledge, he thinks “it would\r\nbe well to provide a corps of enthusiastic scientists ... who have more\r\nthan a pecuniary interest” in their work. But another recommendation of\r\nhis is a direct assault on this simple faith in the honor and integrity\r\nof specialists. Already many of the departments of the State are in\r\nthe hands of men supposed to have a special aptitude and liking for\r\ntheir duties. But Mr. Roberts finds that “leaving the department to\r\nexpend the money as it deems best,” instead of appropriating it for a\r\nspecific purpose, “is not in the interest of economy.” He says that\r\n“it absolutely deprives the Legislature of that judicial scrutiny of\r\nthe necessity of appropriations” that “it should always exercise, and\r\nleaves to the judgment of one what could often be better decided if\r\nconsidered by several.” Could a deadlier blow be given to a common\r\ntheory that under government management we have the same division of\r\nlabor and the same perfect adjustment of means to ends that we have\r\nunder private management? What legislative body, chosen by universal\r\nsuffrage, the most perfect instrument ever invented for the selection\r\nof incompetents, would enable it to exercise the supervision over the\r\nthousand activities of life that Mr. Roberts recommends?\r\n\r\nThe same futile ingenuity exhibited in making officials do their\r\nduty is exhibited in making taxpayers do theirs. One of the multitude\r\nof plans suggested is a single tax on land; but that does not\r\nseem promising, for it would not prevent the discriminations that\r\nassessors make--discriminations that Mr. Roberts himself believes\r\nto be beyond the reach of even State supervision. Another is a more\r\nrigid enforcement of the personal-property tax; but this is equally\r\nunpromising. “The fact is,” says Mr. Roberts, “that from the dawn\r\nof civilization the wit of man has failed to discover a plan by\r\nwhich intangible personal property could be made to pay its share of\r\ntaxation, and it will never be made to pay on the ordinary assessment\r\nplan.” Besides the increase of taxes on corporations, the taxation of\r\nfranchises, which has just been authorized, and a general revision\r\nand simplification of tax laws, it has been proposed that a graded\r\ninheritance tax be adopted. Mr. Roberts is particularly enamored of\r\nthis idea. But his advocacy of it betrays the same disregard of the\r\nrights of others, and leads to the same appeals to specious facts\r\nand arguments that always accompany the commission of aggression in\r\npolitics as well as in war. His reasoning is that since “special\r\nprivileges conferred by government,” such as tariff laws, corporation\r\nlaws, public franchises, etc., are “the foundation of most of the\r\ngreat fortunes of the country to-day”; since these fortunes are, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, “composed of personal property” that “very largely\r\nescapes taxation”; since the decedent has been “allowed the use and\r\nenjoyment of his fortune during life,” and the beneficiary simply\r\npays “a fee for the privilege of receiving an estate in the creation\r\nof which he had little or no hand”; and, finally, since he can make\r\nno just complaint against the payment of such a fee, as his right to\r\nreceive his fortune “comes from the State--is by the grace of the\r\nState”--the seizure at death of a certain percentage of all estates\r\nbeyond a prescribed amount would be only justice to “the mass of small\r\nlandowners and taxpayers who have from year to year borne more than\r\ntheir equitable share of the burden of taxation.” But, the fallacies of\r\nsuch an argument are easily exposed. The moral ownership of property\r\ndoes not lie in the State; it lies in the labor and skill of the man\r\nthat accumulated the property. The moral title to a bequest does not\r\nlie in that fiction either; it lies in the right of the decedent to do\r\nwhatever he pleases with his own. If great fortunes have been unjustly\r\nacquired in consequence of special privileges a great wrong has been\r\ncommitted, and it is not righted by the commission of another wrong.\r\nThe only reparation that can be made is to abolish the privileges. So\r\nobvious a suggestion does not, however, appear to have occurred to Mr.\r\nRoberts.\r\n\r\nBut even if all the reforms in taxation that could be imagined were\r\nput in operation they would not meet the situation; they would not\r\ndeliver the American people from the great and alarming evil of\r\nover-legislation and excessive taxation. An increase of revenue, like\r\nan increase of supervision, is almost certain to increase the injustice\r\nthat it was designed to abate. The first year’s operation of the Raines\r\nlaw contributed more than $3,500,000 to the State treasury, yet the\r\naddition to the public expenditures that accompanied its enactment made\r\na high tax rate necessary. What the situation requires, therefore,\r\nis not more but less social regulation and taxation. We need also a\r\ngradual restriction of the duties of the State to the limits laid down\r\nby Mr. Spencer--to the preservation of order and the enforcement of\r\njustice. Although not apparently a disciple of that philosopher, Mr.\r\nRoberts himself virtually subscribes to this view. In his last report\r\nhe demands “far greater economy and care in public expenditures, and no\r\nfurther excursions in the field of social supervision and regulation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS WITH THE X RAYS.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. JOHN TROWBRIDGE,\r\n\r\nDIRECTOR OF THE JEFFERSON PHYSICAL LABORATORY, HARVARD UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have become accustomed to seeing photographs of the bones of\r\nour hands, and we no longer stop at shop windows to look at X-ray\r\nphotographs. Indeed, they are rarely displayed, and the lecturer who\r\nonce gazed on a sea of faces as he endeavored to explain the most\r\nmarvelous electrical sensation of this century now addresses a mere\r\nhandful of listeners. Such patient hearers continuing to the end may\r\nstill hear of marvelous performances of this strange light of which the\r\ngreat public are even now ignorant, and in this paper I shall take my\r\nreaders into a physical laboratory and endeavor to make the generally\r\nunknown manifestation of the new rays plain and free from technical\r\nlanguage. I am sure that we shall all leave the laboratory with our\r\nimagination full of thoughts of unknown movements in the air about\r\nus--thoughts of possible telepathic waves through space, conceptions of\r\nnew ranges of nerve excitations, hopes of new lights, conceptions of\r\nthe vastness of the electrical whirls in that elevated region where the\r\nmolecules of the air, in their endeavor to fly into the abyss of space,\r\nare controlled by the earth’s forces and are endowed with electrical\r\nenergy by the sun.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, what is the present state of our knowledge of\r\nthe X rays? Have we more efficient methods of producing them, and\r\ncan we see farther into the recesses of the human body? In regard\r\nto the first question, we can say that, although we may not be able\r\nto answer dogmatically that we know what these rays are, we have\r\nvaluable hints in regard to their character, and our knowledge of their\r\nmanifestations and their relation to light waves and magnetic waves\r\nhas greatly increased during the four years which have elapsed since\r\ntheir discovery. They are now believed by the best authorities to be\r\nmagnetic and electrical pulses, or waves of extremely short length. In\r\nthe spectrum of sunlight formed by sending a beam through a prism of\r\nquartz the X-ray pulses or waves are to be found, according to this\r\nhypothesis, beyond the violet color of this spectrum--far into the dark\r\nregion invisible to the eye, and only brought into view at present by\r\nthe aid of photography. In this invisible region reside many singular\r\nmanifestations of energy closely analogous to those of the X rays. The\r\nultra-violet rays invisible to the eye have the property of refraction.\r\nThey can be bent out of their course by prisms made of quartz. The\r\nX rays, however, can not be directed from a straight course. This\r\nis their greatest peculiarity, and many attempts, both mathematical\r\nand experimental, have been made to elucidate it. It is not a fatal\r\nobjection to the X rays being classed with light waves, for, under\r\ncertain conditions, even light waves can be made to lose the power of\r\nbeing bent aside.\r\n\r\nLeaving for the present a further discussion of the question What are\r\nthe X rays? let us examine what the actual condition of the art of\r\nusing the rays is. Many attempts have been made to improve the Crooke’s\r\ntube, in which the rays are produced, but, like the hand telephone,\r\nits form has remained substantially unaltered since the first flush\r\nof discovery. Its present form consists of a bulb of thin glass,\r\nexhausted of air, containing a little concave mirror of aluminum, and\r\nopposite to this, separated by a gap of several inches, is an inclined\r\nsheet of thin platinum, called the focus plane, or anticathode. The\r\nelectrical discharge passes between this plane and the mirror, and the\r\nX rays are thrown off from the inclined sheet of platinum. They are\r\nnot reflected in the ordinary sense of the term, but the electric rays\r\nconverge from the mirror to a spot on the platinum which glows with a\r\nred heat, and the X rays emanate from the heated spot as if it were\r\ntheir source. Thousands of investigators have endeavored to improve\r\nthe form of tube, but, with several important minor appendages, it\r\nstill maintains the principal features of an aluminum concave mirror\r\nand an inclined plane of platinum. Aluminum is found to be the best\r\nmetal for the mirror from which the rays are generated, largely because\r\nits metallic particles are not torn off by the discharge, as would\r\nbe the case if it were made of platinum. It is also light, and can be\r\neasily fixed to a platinum wire. Among the important modifications of\r\nthe tube are those which enable the operator to control the degree of\r\nvacuum in the tube. This is accomplished by sealing to the main tube\r\nan appendage containing certain chemicals which, on being heated, give\r\noff a small amount of vapor, and which take it up again on cooling.\r\nThis modification is made necessary by the singular fact that after a\r\nCrooke’s tube is submitted to an electrical discharge for some time\r\nthe vacuum becomes more and more complete, and a higher and higher\r\nelectro-motive force or pressure is needed to produce the discharge\r\nin the tube. It prefers in time to jump over the surface. Thus, at\r\nthe very beginning of our use of the X rays we meet with a mystery.\r\nWhere do the remaining particles of air go? It is surmised that they\r\ndisappear in the platinum terminals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--The evolution of the Crooke’s tube.]\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of the X-ray tubes tests technical skill and the\r\npatience of the experimenter more highly, perhaps, than the preparation\r\nof any apparatus used in science. Glass working is a difficult art,\r\nand requires an absolute devotion to it. There is only one metal\r\nknown which will enable an electrical discharge to pass into and out\r\nof a rarefied space inclosed by glass. This is platinum. A wire of\r\nthis metal can be sealed into glass so that no air can leak into an\r\nexhausted space around the joints. All electric lamps, so commonly used\r\nin electric lighting, have little wires of platinum at their bases, by\r\nmeans of which the electric current enters and leaves the bulb. The\r\nCrooke’s tube is in principle an Edison lamp with the filament broken.\r\nThe maker of Crooke’s tubes should complete the making of the tube\r\nat one sitting, for reheating of the tube is very apt to lead to a\r\ndisastrous cracking of the glass. He must take the utmost precautions\r\nagainst unequal heating and sudden cooling, and he must, above all,\r\nhave phenomenal patience.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 shows the evolution of the Crooke’s tube which is used to\r\nproduce the X rays. The first form of tube was barely larger than a\r\ngoose’s egg. The size has been gradually increased, and at present it\r\nis three or four times larger than the original form. The interior\r\narrangement has not been materially changed, and consists, as we have\r\nsaid, of a concave mirror, which constitutes the negative electrode,\r\nand an inclined sheet of platinum, from which the X rays seem to\r\nemanate.\r\n\r\nThe later forms of tube have accessory chambers, filled with certain\r\nchemicals, which, on being slightly heated, reduce the vacuum to the\r\ndesired point. Certain forms of tubes have merely an additional chamber\r\nwhich, on being heated, reduces the vacuum in the main vessel. The\r\nlatest form of tube, devised by Dr. William Rollins, of Boston, has a\r\nhollow anode tube (_B C_, Fig. 1), through which a current of water\r\ncan circulate in order to save the tube from breaking. The end of this\r\nanode tube is small, in order to form a sharp radiant point of light.\r\nOne of the platinum wires (_P_) inserted in the tube projects outside\r\nsome distance. When the vacuum becomes too high in the tube, this\r\nplatinum wire is slightly heated in a gas flame; then the flame is\r\nblown out and the hydrogen is allowed to flow against the heated wire.\r\nA sufficient amount of the gas is absorbed by the heated wire to reduce\r\nthe vacuum in the tube. This tube stands very powerful electrical\r\ndischarges, and is the most scientifically designed tube at the command\r\nof the experimenter.\r\n\r\nThere are three methods of generating the electrical discharge which\r\nproduces the rays. The commonest method is that in which the Ruhmkorf\r\ncoil is used. This coil is what is now known as a transformer, and\r\nconsists of one coil of a few turns of coarse wire, which is connected\r\nto a battery or other source of electricity, and of another coil\r\nsurrounding the first of a great number of turns of fine wire. Any\r\nsudden change of the battery current produces an electric pressure or\r\nelectro-motive force at the ends of the fine coil of wire. By this\r\nsimple arrangement of two coils we can thus exalt a current of low\r\npressure to one of high electro-motive force. A battery current which\r\ncan barely produce an electric spark of one hundredth of an inch at the\r\nends of the coarse coil can cause a spark of eight inches or more at\r\nthe terminals of a fine coil.\r\n\r\nIn the second method one uses an ordinary electrical machine in which\r\nthe glass plates are supplanted by rubber ones, which are run at a\r\nhigh rate of speed. Both of these methods have their advocates. The use\r\nof the Ruhmkorf coil is the most universal.\r\n\r\nThe third method consists in charging a number of Leyden jars by a\r\nstorage battery and in discharging these one after another, so as to\r\nobtain a high electro-motive force. This method is a very flexible one.\r\nI can experiment with my apparatus over a range of electric pressure\r\nextending from twenty thousand units to three million. The electrical\r\ndischarge produced by three million units or volts is over six feet in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus for discharging the Leyden jars or condensers in series\r\nis represented in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Apparatus for producing electrical sparks six\r\nfeet in length.]\r\n\r\nA fourth method, first used by Professors Norton and Goodwin, of the\r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, consists in discharging a\r\nquantity of electricity through the coarse coil of a Ruhmkorf coil.\r\nThis method obviates the necessity of a mechanical break to interrupt\r\nthe battery current which is employed to excite the current in the\r\ncoarse coil of this apparatus.\r\n\r\nI have experimented with more powerful quantities of electricity than\r\nhave been hitherto used. The accompanying photograph gives an idea of\r\nthe magnitude of the quantity which I can use to excite the X rays.\r\n\r\nIt represents the discharge, burning a fine iron wire, and it makes a\r\nnoise resembling the crack of a pistol. Now, this discharge can be used\r\nin a variety of ways to excite various transformers in order to produce\r\nthe best conditions for exciting the X rays. The method of using this\r\npowerful discharge to excite a transformer seems at present the most\r\npromising one in seeking the best conditions for obtaining rays of high\r\npenetrating power.\r\n\r\nThere is still another method of obtaining the rays yet in its\r\ninfancy--the simplest method of all, for no apparatus is required.\r\n\r\nIt has been discovered that certain substances, like the salts of\r\nuranium, have the power of emitting rays which have all the properties\r\nof the X rays. The list of such substances is constantly increasing,\r\nand they are called radio-active substances. It is possible to take a\r\nshadow picture of the hand through a board by placing the hand on a\r\ncovered sensitive plate, resting the board on the back of the hand,\r\nand strewing the board with one of these radio-active substances in\r\nthe form of a powder. Can it be that all the skill and industry which\r\nhas been employed to perfect X-ray apparatus is to be supplanted by\r\na powder? The peculiar property shown by the radio-active substances\r\nleads investigators to surmise that we have evidence of new substances,\r\nand we have the waves radium and polonium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--The burning of an iron wire by the most\r\npowerful electric discharge yet produced.]\r\n\r\nThe methods by which the X rays are detected in practical employment in\r\nsurgery have not been essentially changed. The ordinary photographic\r\nplate, shielded in a plate holder, is still used to receive the\r\nshadow cast by the bones, and salts of barium or of calcium strewn\r\non pasteboard serve as fluorescent screens to receive on their\r\nluminous surfaces these shadows and to make them evident to the eye.\r\nAn interesting use of flexible sensitive films instead of glass plates\r\nhas been made in dentistry. The films are put in the mouth, and the\r\nCrooke’s tube placed outside in such a position that the rays can pass\r\nthrough the jaw. In this way the accompanying photographs were taken\r\n(Fig. 4).[D]\r\n\r\n    [D] Kindness of Dr. Dwight M. Clapp, Boston.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--1. Male patient, aged ten years.

Right temporary\r\ncentral cut incisor destroyed by a blow five years previous, showing\r\ngutta-percha filling put in at the time which, with the dead root,\r\nhas been absorbed (same as the live root of the other central).

In general,\r\nX-ray photographs convey more information to the skilled eye of the\r\nspecialist than to the untrained inspector of them. They should be\r\nstudied from the negatives themselves, for the delicate details can not\r\nbe reproduced in a print. It is remarkable that shadow pictures can\r\nshow so much definition. Here is a photograph of an elbow joint which\r\nshows the texture of the bones (Fig. 5).[E]\r\n\r\n    [E] Taken by Professor Goodspeed, University of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe use of the fluorescent screen, too, has been greatly extended. Dr.\r\nFrancis H. Williams, of Boston, has used it as a valuable instrument\r\nin medical diagnosis, especially in studying lung diseases. It has\r\nbeen used at the Harvard Medical School to follow the processes of\r\ndigestion. To accomplish this, in one instance a goose was fed with\r\nfood mixed with subnitrate of bismuth, a salt which absorbs X rays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Photograph of an elbow joint, showing the\r\ntexture of the bones.]\r\n\r\nThe passage of the dark mass down the long neck of the bird could be\r\ntraced on the fluorescent screen, and the peculiarities of its motion\r\nin the gullet could be studied. A cat was also fed with the same\r\nsubstance, and the movements of its stomach noted. These movements were\r\nanalogous to those of the heart--in other words, were rhythmical when\r\nthe processes of digestion were going on normally and uninterruptedly.\r\nWhen, however, the cat was irritated, it may be by the sight of a dog,\r\nthese pulsations instantly ceased. As soon as the source of vexation\r\nwas removed and the purring of the animal showed a contented frame of\r\nmind, the stomach resumed its rhythmical movements. The dependence of\r\nthe digestive apparatus on the state of the nervous system was thus\r\nclearly shown. The female cat was much more tractable under these\r\nexperiments than the male.\r\n\r\nThe use of the X rays is accompanied with some danger if the Crooke’s\r\ntube is not properly used. A long exposure to the X rays is apt to\r\nproduce bad burns which are like sunburns, and lead in certain cases\r\nto bad ulcerations. They are long in healing and are characterized by\r\na peculiar red glow, especially on exposure to a cold wind. To prevent\r\nthem one should place a sheet of thin aluminum between the Crooke’s\r\ntube and the part of the body submitted to the rays. This sheet should\r\nbe connected to the earth. This fact should be borne in mind when we\r\ncome to speak of the electrical region outside a Crooke’s tube.\r\n\r\nMany investigators, reflecting upon the singular fact that the rays\r\npass so freely through thin aluminum and that, on the contrary,\r\nglass absorbs such a large percentage, concluded that Crooke’s tubes\r\nprovided with aluminum windows would be an improvement upon the thin\r\nincandescent lamplike bulbs now used. The glass of these bulbs is very\r\nthin, not more than one thousandth of an inch in thickness, where the\r\nrays emerge, not thicker than a sheet of ordinary note paper, and\r\nthe absorption of such a sheet of glass is so small that it can not\r\nbe detected by photography. Thus a sliver of glass of this thickness\r\nin the hand would not appear on the X-ray photograph of this member,\r\nand would not cast a shadow in the fluoroscope. There does not\r\nseem, therefore, any advantage in supplying a Crooke’s tube with an\r\naluminum window. The mechanical difficulties, too, in accomplishing\r\nthis are very great. There is no way of joining the thin aluminum\r\ndisk to the glass so that an air-tight joint can be made. In the\r\nprocess of exhausting the Crooke’s tube, the tube must be heated to\r\na comparatively high temperature in order to drive off the air which\r\nclings to the inside of the glass. The rise of temperature would soften\r\nor melt any current which might be used to make the aluminum adhere to\r\nthe glass.\r\n\r\nWe can not expect, therefore, any improvement in the direction of\r\naluminum windows. At one time, I suppose that the rays were highly\r\nabsorbed in passing through atmospheric air, and that it would be an\r\nimprovement in the application of the rays to surgery to interpose, so\r\nto speak, a vacuum chamber between the body and the source of the X\r\nrays. The experiment led to some interesting results, but not in the\r\ndirection anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe vacuum chamber consisted of a glass cylinder three feet long and\r\nabout eight inches in diameter. The two ends were closed by sheets of\r\naluminum, and it could be exhausted through a side tube. The reader\r\nwill immediately ask, in view of what has been said, How could the\r\nglass tube be hermetically closed with sheets of aluminum? This was\r\nindeed a difficult matter, but less difficult than in the case of the\r\nCrooke’s tube, for the ends of the glass cylinder were provided with\r\nheavy brass flanges, which were perfectly flat, and the sheets of\r\naluminum lying smoothly could be confined by many bolts between the\r\nflange and suitable brass heads. This cylinder, having been exhausted,\r\nwas placed between the Crooke’s tube and the arm, for instance, in\r\nthe hope that a greater depth of human flesh and tissue might be\r\npenetrated by the rays. It was speedily seen that the absorption of\r\nthe layer of air three feet thick could not be detected either by\r\nphotographs or the fluorescent screen. The glass cylinder was then\r\nfilled with rarefied hydrogen, but no advantage was apparent. If the\r\nphotographs of the human hand were taken, one through the rarefied\r\ncylinder and the other through an equivalent thickness of air, no\r\ndifference in clearness or depth of definition could be perceived. The\r\namount of absorption by a column of air three feet in length is less\r\nthan ten per cent. This result interested me greatly, for it shows the\r\nremarkable difference between the X rays and the cathode rays, which\r\nhad been investigated by Crooke, Hittorf, and Lenard; for the cathode\r\nrays are greatly absorbed by atmospheric air, being reduced in passing\r\nthrough five or six inches of air to one four-hundredth part of their\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe small amount of absorption of the X rays lifts them into the realm\r\nof very short wave lengths of light, for their behavior in regard to\r\nthe absorption by air is very analogous to that of ultra-violet rays.\r\nAlthough the vacuum chamber, by which I looked, showed no absorption\r\nof the X rays, it disclosed a beautiful phenomenon. In a dark room\r\nthis large tube, three feet long and eight inches wide, was filled\r\nwith a roseate light, which wavered like the northern lights when the\r\nCrooke’s tube was emitting the X rays. If the finger was brought near\r\nthe glass walls of the cylinder a stream of light apparently emanated\r\nfrom a point on the inside wall of the cylinder. The hand thus had\r\nghostly streamers giving an image of it, although the hand itself was\r\ninvisible. These banners of light could be diverted in any direction\r\nby the hand or by any conducting body brought near, and gave a vivid\r\nconception of how the streaming of the aurora can be brought about by\r\nthis flitting of conducting clouds or the drifting of moisture-laden\r\nstrata of air below the rarefied space in which the beams of the\r\nnorthern light dart back and forth. Both in the case of the Crooke’s\r\ntube and the aurora these streamers are produced by electrical\r\ndischarges through rarefied air. The experiments show that outside the\r\nCrooke’s tube there is a strong electrical attraction and repulsion,\r\nwhich is only revealed in darkness and in a cold, lifeless, airless\r\nspace, such as exists between us and the sun. Can we not extend our\r\nthoughts from the contemplation of this laboratory experiment to that\r\nof the immensely greater play of electrical forces between the earth\r\nand the sun across the immense vacant space ninety millions of miles in\r\ndistance?\r\n\r\nThe mysterious effects of the X rays on the molecules in the air form\r\na great subject of inquiry, and the investigation of it promises to\r\nextend our knowledge of electricity and light and heat. When the\r\nCrooke’s tube is excited we are conscious of a mysterious activity\r\nwithin it, for its glass walls glow with a phosphorescent light, and\r\nif certain crystals, like the diamond or the ruby, are placed in the\r\ntube, this phosphorescent light is vivid. Outside the tube, in free\r\nair, these luminescent effects are also present. The air is under an\r\nelectrical strain, which is shown by the auroral streamers when this\r\nair is rarefied, and an electrical charge can not be maintained on a\r\npith ball--it is dissipated in some strange manner. Still stranger,\r\nan electrical current is greatly aided by the X rays in its endeavor\r\nto pass through air--they make for the time being air a conductor.\r\nFurthermore, these rays separate the air into positively laden and\r\nnegatively laden particles.\r\n\r\nThe electrical discharge in the Crooke’s tube is many-sided in its\r\nmanifestations. Its energy seems all-pervading in the room where it\r\noccurs. Before the discharge passes through the rarefied space in the\r\ntube its energy manifests itself by a crackling spark, a miniature\r\nlightning discharge. This spark, five or six inches in length, can\r\nsend out magnetic waves which extend far beyond the narrow limits of\r\nthe room. They can be detected, by the methods of wireless telegraphy,\r\nfifty miles. When the same amount of energy is developed in a Crooke’s\r\ntube the magnetic waves hardly pass beyond the walls of the room, and\r\nthe phenomenon of phosphorescence and fluorescence and the strange\r\nmolecular effects outside the Crooke’s tube spring into prominence.\r\nThe crackling spark outside the tube is far-reaching in its effect,\r\nyet it shows no signs of the X rays, its light can not penetrate the\r\nhuman body, it excites only a feeble phosphorescence at a distance\r\nof even two or three feet, while the same energy excited in the\r\nCrooke’s tube can cause luminescence at a distance of twenty feet.\r\nThe crackling spark, however, can be seen much farther than the light\r\nof the Crooke’s tube, and it can also impress a photographic plate at\r\nmuch greater distance. The following experiments will illustrate the\r\ndifferent manifestations of energy of which an electrical discharge\r\nis capable. I produced an electrical spark about six inches in length\r\nand exposed a photographic plate for six seconds, at a distance of\r\ntwo, ten, and twenty feet, to its light. A thin strip of tin, with a\r\ncircular hole cut in it, served as a shutter. The sensitive plate was\r\nthus protected, except in front of this aperture. The images exhibit\r\nthe decrease in light with the increase of distance. Another portion\r\nof the sensitive plate was exposed in the same manner during the same\r\nlength of time to the light of a Crooke’s tube which was excited by\r\nthis same spark. No image was obtained at a distance of ten feet,\r\nand barely one at three feet. The spark in air, therefore, was far\r\nmore energetic photographically than the X rays, but it could not\r\npenetrate solid materials. This property was given to it by its passage\r\nthrough rarefied space. I then covered a screen with a phosphorescent\r\nsubstance, and exposed it to the spark in air. The phosphorescent light\r\ncould barely be detected at a distance of three feet, while with a\r\nspark in rarefied air it could be seen at a distance of twenty feet.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider these experiments we see that the X rays act toward\r\nphosphorescent matter much as the spark in air behaves toward the\r\nphotographic plate. Now, these results, taken in connection with the\r\nstrong electrical effects in the neighborhood of an excited Crooke’s\r\ntube, points to a certain connection between phosphorescence and\r\nelectricity. Can it be that the strange light is excited by very short\r\nelectrical waves sent out from the tube, which can not travel far\r\nbut are very active in producing molecular effects? This activity,\r\nindeed, may prevent their extending to great distances. Wireless\r\ntelegraphy evidently depends upon one set of waves sent out by a spark,\r\nand X-ray photographs upon another set developed only in rarefied\r\nair. Phosphorescence can not be produced with ease by the spark in\r\nair. On the contrary, it is developed to a remarkable degree and\r\nat comparatively great distances by the discharge in rarefied air.\r\nIt has been shown by Mr. Burbank and myself that electrical force\r\ncan develop phosphorescent light in certain crystals. The sunlight\r\ncan do the same. Is sunlight an electrical phenomenon? That it is\r\nconstitutes the greatest hypothesis in physics of this century. When\r\nwe reflect, too, that the phosphorescence of the firefly is excited by\r\nsome manifestation of a living organism--nerve force or some related\r\nforce--shall we not include nerve force in the electrical category?\r\n\r\nThe X rays, therefore, bring into prominence strange lights which had\r\nheretofore been noticed chiefly by keen-eyed investigators, and which,\r\nwith their names, phosphorescence and fluorescence, were unknown to the\r\nbulk of mankind. The fluorescent screen, by means of which surgeons\r\nobserve the skeleton of the body, has now taken its place in medical\r\npractice with the stethoscope, by which the mechanism of the lungs is\r\nstudied, and hopes have been excited that the blind may yet use the\r\nX rays in detecting objects and in regaining a sense of vision, even\r\nthough this sense may be only partial. It is a curious fact that the\r\nretina of the eye is phosphorescent and fluorescent, and that one can\r\nsee the shadow of certain objects in the dark when one stands so that\r\nthe feeble X rays fall upon the eye. In other words, the retina acts\r\nas a fluorescent screen. The eye at present recognizes only a limited\r\nnumber of the waves that are surging about us. We can see the colors\r\nfrom red to violet, but the dark colors, so to speak, formed by waves\r\nlonger than 1/40000 of an inch and shorter than 1/100000 of an inch\r\nmake no recognizable impress upon our retina, unless, indeed, they\r\nconstitute telepathic signals which apparently stir our consciousness\r\nand make us believe that friends are communicating from a distance. The\r\nelectrical discharge has lifted, so to speak, a realm of short waves of\r\nenergy out of the darkness and made them visible. Can the human brain\r\nbe made conscious of other waves which fill space?\r\n\r\nBut we have not by any means exhausted the protean manifestations\r\nof the X rays. Besides the photographic, the phosphorescent, and\r\nfluorescent effects, there are still more singular properties of these\r\nrays. One of the most striking consists in their opening a path for a\r\ncurrent of electricity. The electrical discharge, feeble in itself,\r\nnot capable of lifting by means of a motor a pound weight a foot from\r\nthe floor, is yet competent to open a path for a current which can\r\nset all the trolley cars of a great city in motion. To exhibit this\r\nmysterious effect we bring the ends of the electrical current which\r\nwe wish to excite near each other, but not touching, in a glass tube\r\nwith thin walls, from which the air has been exhausted. When the X rays\r\nfall on the gap between the wires the electrical current immediately\r\njumps across the gap with a vivid light. We have here the mechanism\r\nof an electrical relay--the feeble energy of the electric discharge\r\ncan call into play a giant energy. By what energy does it accomplish\r\nthis? Is it by compelling molecules to put themselves in line, so that\r\nthe electrical current can bridge the gap? Is it by breaking down\r\nthis mysterious ether of space, as if we threw a stone at a turbid\r\nbull’s eye in a prison chamber and let in a flood of sunlight? How the\r\nimagination is stirred by this process, what seems dead and lifeless\r\ncan, by a physical agency, be stirred to endless activity! The rays are\r\nlike the touch of Ithuriel’s spear.\r\n\r\nThe electrical discharge can accomplish all this, but the story of\r\nits activity is not yet told. It can not be told, for each year adds\r\ninformation in regard to these activities, for there are thousands\r\nof investigators at work. Another far-reaching manifestation is\r\nthis: the rays can separate the air or a gas into its constituent\r\nparticles, much as a strong electrical current separates water into\r\noxygen and hydrogen. They can communicate electrical charges to these\r\nparticles--positive and negative charges. The charged air-particles,\r\nwhen forced through partitions of spun glass, does not give up their\r\nelectricity as they do when they are charged by an electrical machine.\r\nThis curious manifestation leads me to suspect that the electricity\r\nand magnetism of the earth may be caused by an X-ray effect on our\r\natmosphere. The sun and the earth are separated like the terminals of\r\na Crooke’s tube--two conductors with a vacuum between. An electrical\r\nexcitation from the sun may cause an electrical discharge between it\r\nand the earth. This discharge might consist of an X-ray effect which\r\ncould separate the upper layers of the atmosphere into positive and\r\nnegative charges. The velocity of the negatively charged particles is\r\ngreater than that of the positively charged ones, and the revolution\r\nof the earth may cause such a movement of these electrified particles\r\nthat electrical currents may be generated which in circulation around\r\nthe earth could produce the observed magnetism of the north and south\r\npoles, together with the auroral lights characteristic of those\r\nregions. This, I am well aware, is an audacious theory. It is certainly\r\na vast extension of the laboratory experiments I have described, but\r\nthe electrical radiations developed in electrical discharges are as\r\ncompetent to produce powerful magnetic whirls as the heat radiations\r\nin our atmosphere to develop cyclones. In the lower regions of our\r\natmosphere the air is an insulator like glass to the passage of an\r\nelectrical current. A layer a foot thick can prevent the circulation of\r\nthe most powerful current which is now used to generate horse power.\r\nWhen this air space is rarefied at a certain degree of rarefaction\r\nthe electrical current passes, especially, as we have seen, if it is\r\nilluminated by the X rays. When, therefore, we ascend to a height of\r\nten or twenty miles the rarefied air becomes an excellent conductor of\r\nelectricity of high electro-motive force. To my mind the conditions\r\nexist for developing an electrical state in the earth’s covering of\r\nair, which is competent to explain the electrical manifestations of\r\nthe air, the auroral gleam, and the mysterious effect on the magnetic\r\nneedle which keeps it directed to the magnetic north. Can not we\r\nconclude that the study of the X rays bids fair to greatly extend\r\nour conceptions of the constitution of matter and of the action and\r\ninteraction of Nature’s forces?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    A Himalayan explorer reported, a few years ago, that he had seen,\r\n    from one of the lofty summits of the Mount Everest district, a peak\r\n    which, beheld in the same view with Mount Everest, was evidently\r\n    higher than it. Nothing has been heard of the matter since then\r\n    till the recent appearance of Major L. A. Waddell’s book, Among\r\n    the Himalayas. This author, who has explored the same region,\r\n    represents that the Tibetans there say there is another mountain,\r\n    due north of Mount Everest, that exceeds that peak in height, thus\r\n    confirming the story of the former Alpinist. It appears that Mount\r\n    Everest is not called Gaurisankar or Deodunga, as some affirm,\r\n    but that the Tibetan name of the culminating peak of the group is\r\n    _Jomokang-kar_--“The Lady White Glacier.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA HUNDRED YEARS OF CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\nBY F. W. CLARKE,\r\n\r\nCHIEF CHEMIST, UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is hardly an exaggeration to say that chemistry, as a science, is\r\nthe creation of the nineteenth century. Chemical facts, indeed, were\r\nknown even in remote antiquity; some principles were dimly anticipated\r\nlong before the century began; Boyle had given the first rational\r\ndefinition of an element; the principal gases had been discovered;\r\ngreat foundations were laid, ready for the superstructure. But the\r\nmaking of bricks is not architecture, nor does the accumulation\r\nof details constitute a science. The scattered facts are needful\r\npreliminaries, but only with the discovery of laws and the development\r\nof broad generalizations does true science begin.\r\n\r\nThat truth can be born from error may seem paradoxical, but,\r\nnevertheless, the statement is exact. False hypotheses stimulate\r\ninvestigation, and so truth comes at last to light. In the history\r\nof chemistry this principle is clearly illustrated. During the\r\neighteenth century the doctrine of phlogiston was generally accepted;\r\nthis led to exhaustive researches upon combustion, and from these the\r\nscience of chemistry received its present shape. Becher and Stahl\r\nhad taught that every combustible substance contained a combustible\r\nprinciple--_phlogiston_--and that to the elimination of this principle\r\nthe phenomena of combustion were due. According to this theory, a metal\r\nwas regarded as a compound of its calx, or oxide, with phlogiston;\r\nhydrogen became a compound of water with phlogiston, and so the truth\r\nwas curiously inverted. The doctrine was vigorously and ingeniously\r\ndefended, and, although it was overthrown by Lavoisier, it had\r\npersistent supporters even after the present century began.\r\n\r\nThe weak point of the phlogistic theory was its practical disregard of\r\nthe phenomena of weight. That the calx weighed more than the metal was\r\nwell known, but quantitative considerations were subordinated to those\r\nof quality, and the form of matter was studied rather than its mass.\r\n\r\nIn 1770 the scientific career of Lavoisier began, and the balance\r\nbecame a chief instrument in chemical research. The constancy of\r\nweight during chemical change was experimentally established, and\r\nwhat had been a philosophical speculation--the increatability and\r\nindestructibility of matter--became a doctrine of science, a datum\r\nof knowledge instead of a hypothetical belief. In 1774 Priestley and\r\nScheele independently discovered oxygen, and with the aid of the\r\nbalance the phenomena of combustion were rendered intelligible. The\r\nfoundations of chemistry were laid, and upon them the nineteenth\r\ncentury has built. Lavoisier, the greatest of the founders, fell a\r\nvictim to the guillotine; the judge who condemned him refused all\r\nappeals for mercy, saying “the republic has no need for _savants_,”\r\nbut the necessity which judicial ignorance could not foresee presently\r\nmade itself felt. France, at war with all Europe, her ports closed to\r\nsupplies from without, fell back upon her own resources. Saltpeter\r\nwas needed for her guns, alkali for her industries, and the chemist\r\nwas called upon for help. The stress of continued warfare stimulated\r\nintellectual activity, and one result was the creation of chemical\r\nprocesses which revolutionized more than one industry. The dependence\r\nof modern civilization upon science then began to be recognized--a\r\ndependence which is, perhaps, the chief characteristic of the present\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nWith the opening of the new century a period of great activity began.\r\nThe constancy of matter was well established, and the fundamental\r\ndistinction between elements and compounds was clearly recognized; two\r\nstarting points for exact research had been gained. Only a small number\r\nof elements, however, had been identified as such; of some substances\r\nit was doubtful whether they were elementary or not, but the mine was\r\nopen and a rich body of ore was in sight. Furthermore, the utility of\r\nresearch had become evident, so that intellectual curiosity received a\r\nnew stimulus and a new direction. Theory and practice became partners,\r\nand have worked together to this day.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1803 and 1808 one of the greatest advances, in\r\nscientific chemistry was made, when John Dalton announced and developed\r\nhis famous atomic theory. In this we find a notable illustration of the\r\ndifference between metaphysics and science. The conception of matter as\r\nmade up of atoms, as discrete rather than continuous, was a commonplace\r\nof philosophical speculation. It had been taught by Democritus and\r\nLucretius; it was the theme of wordy wrangles during centuries;\r\nSwedenborg, Higgins, and other writers had sought to apply it to the\r\ndiscussion of chemical phenomena; but it remained only a speculation,\r\nunfruitful for discovery. Up to the time of Dalton it had led to\r\nnothing but intellectual gymnastics.\r\n\r\nA good scientific theory is never a product of the unaided imagination;\r\nit must serve some purpose in the correlation of phenomena which\r\nsuggest it to the mind. This was the case with Dalton’s discovery,\r\nwhich grew out of his observations upon definite and multiple\r\nproportions. That every chemical compound has a fixed and definite\r\ncomposition was recognized by Lavoisier, and by other chemists before\r\nhim; but the fact was disputed by Berthollet, and its verity was not\r\nestablished until 1808. Dalton went a step further, and found that to\r\nevery element a definite combining number could be assigned, and that\r\nwhen two elements united in more than one proportion even multiples of\r\nthat number appeared. Thus, taking the hydrogen weight as unity, oxygen\r\nalways combines with other elements in the proportion of eight parts\r\nor some simple multiple thereof, and so on through the entire list of\r\nelementary bodies. Each one has its own combining weight, and this was\r\nthe law for which Dalton sought an adequate explanation. Fractions of\r\nthe weights did not appear, fractional atoms could not exist; the two\r\nthoughts were connected by Dalton. Chemical union, to his mind, became\r\na juxtaposition of atoms, whose relative weights were indicated by\r\ntheir combining numbers, and so the atomic conception for the first\r\ntime was given quantitative expression. The facts were co-ordinated,\r\nthe special laws were combined in one general theory, and the mere\r\nsuppositions of other men were supplanted by a precise statement,\r\nwhich is a corner stone of chemistry to-day. The doctrine led at once\r\nto investigations, it rendered possible the discovery of new truth,\r\nchemical formulæ and chemical equations were developed from it; without\r\nits aid the growth of chemical science would probably have been\r\nslow. The nature of the atoms may be in doubt, they may be divisible\r\nor indivisible, but the value of the theory is independent of such\r\nconsiderations. It gives adequate expression to known laws, and it can\r\nonly be set aside, if ever, by absorption into some wider and deeper\r\ngeneralization.\r\n\r\nThe same year which saw the completion of Dalton’s theory (1807) was\r\nalso signalized by the remarkable discoveries of Sir Humphry Davy, who\r\ndecomposed the alkalies and proved them to be compounds of metals.\r\nIn 1810 chlorine, which was previously thought to be a compound, was\r\nproved to be elementary, and this fact was emphasized a year later\r\nby the discovery of iodine. These researches gave precision to the\r\nconception of an element, and prepared the way for later investigations\r\nupon many other oxides. All the so-called “earths”--lime, magnesia,\r\nalumina, and so on--were now seen to be oxy-compounds of metals, and\r\nan intelligent interpretation of all forms of inorganic matter became\r\npossible. The first step in the chain of research was the discovery\r\nof oxygen itself; from that, and from the teachings of Lavoisier, the\r\nlater discoveries logically followed.\r\n\r\nWhile the investigations of Dalton and of Davy were still incomplete,\r\nother chemists were actively studying the properties of gases and\r\nexploring the fertile border-land between chemistry and physics. In\r\n1805 Gay-Lussac and Humboldt determined the composition of water by\r\n_volume_; in 1808 Gay-Lussac extended these observations, and found\r\nthat in all compound gases simple volumetric relations existed; and\r\nin 1811 the entire subject was generalized into Avogadro’s law.\r\nAvogadro showed that equal volumes of gases, compared under equivalent\r\nconditions, must contain equal numbers of molecules, and although the\r\nforce of his discovery was not fully appreciated until much later,\r\nit is now recognized as one of the fundamental propositions of both\r\nphysics and chemistry. For the first time the distinction between atoms\r\nand molecules was clearly stated, and from the density of a gas the\r\nrelative weight of its molecule could be calculated. Avogadro’s law\r\nrounded out and completed the atomic theory, and to its application\r\nmuch of the advance in organic chemistry is due. Equally striking, but\r\nless far-reaching in its consequences, was the discovery announced by\r\nDulong and Petit in 1819, when it was shown that the specific heat of\r\nan element was inversely proportional to its atomic weight. Otherwise\r\nstated, this law asserts that the atoms of all the elements have the\r\nsame capacity for heat, and an important check upon determinations of\r\natomic weight was thus provided.\r\n\r\nThe next twenty years in the history of chemistry were years of\r\ndetail rather than of permanent generalizations. The multitudinous\r\nverification of known laws, the development of experimental methods,\r\nespecially methods of analysis, the discovery of new elements, the\r\npreparation of numberless new compounds, occupied the attention of most\r\nworkers. This period, which may be called the Berzelian period, was\r\nenormously fruitful in results, although but few of the theories then\r\nproposed have survived to the present day. During this period the name\r\nand influence of Berzelius overshadowed all others, and his marvelous\r\nresearches, carried out in a laboratory which was hardly more than\r\na kitchen, were of almost incredible variety. For the crude symbols\r\nof Dalton, Berzelius substituted a system of chemical formulæ which\r\ncould be used in chemical equations; in 1818 and 1826 he published\r\ntables of atomic weights, determined with far greater exactness than\r\never before; he discovered five new elements and a multitude of\r\ncompounds, devised methods of research, and proposed theories which,\r\nthough later to be overthrown, for many years dominated chemical\r\nscience. His electro-chemical experiments led him to his dualistic\r\ntheory of compounds, which interpreted each compound as made up of two\r\nparts--one positive, the other negative. The electro-positive oxides\r\nwere basic, the electro-negative groups were acid; chemical affinity\r\nwas electrical attraction between the two opposites; chemical union\r\nimplied a neutralization of one by the other. These ideas were more\r\nthan speculation, for they rested upon experiment and led to further\r\nexperimental research; but they went too far, and therefore could\r\nnot last. The theory, however, contained much that was true, and the\r\nformulæ developed by it gave the first general suggestion of what is\r\nnow known as chemical structure or constitution. The later study of\r\norganic compounds led up to the modern views.\r\n\r\nAlthough Berzelius and many other chemists did some work upon organic\r\ncompounds, their era was chiefly identified with inorganic researches.\r\nMineral chemistry received a great deal of attention, the relatively\r\nsimple acids, bases, and salts were studied, but the compounds of\r\ncarbon were thought to be more complex and received less consideration.\r\nTo-day, at the close of the century, nearly seventy thousand organic\r\ncompounds are known, and of these comparatively few were discovered\r\nbefore the year 1830. Since then organic chemistry has been the\r\ndominant line of investigation.\r\n\r\nAmong the earlier chemists of the nineteenth century it was commonly\r\nsupposed that organic and inorganic matter were radically different,\r\nand that the former could only be produced by the operation of a\r\npeculiar vital force. To this view there were some dissentients,\r\nBerzelius among them, but experimental proof for their contention\r\nwas lacking. In 1827, however, Wöhler succeeded in transforming the\r\ninorganic ammonium cyanate into the organic urea, and the barrier was\r\nbroken down. The era of synthetic chemistry had begun. Still earlier,\r\nin 1823, Liebig had found that silver cyanate and silver fulminate\r\npossessed the same percentage composition; in 1825 Faraday discovered\r\nan isomer of ethylene; and Wöhler’s research now gave a third example\r\nof the same kind. Two different substances could contain the same\r\nelements in the same proportions, and to explain this fact Berzelius\r\ninferred different arrangements of atoms within the molecule, and\r\nsuggested that their mode of union might be determined. A working\r\ntheory, however, was still lacking, and without it progress was\r\nnecessarily slow. The dualistic hypothesis explained the phenomena\r\nonly in part, and as the known facts increased in number it had to be\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nTwo important investigations paved the way for an advance. In 1832\r\nLiebig and Wöhler, studying benzoic acid, found that it and its\r\nderivatives contained in common a group of atoms, not isolable by\r\nitself, to which they gave the name of benzoyl. The conception of such\r\na group, a compound radicle, already existed, but it lacked clearness,\r\nand now for the first time it became truly a scientific idea. The\r\nsearch for, and the identification of, compound radicles began to\r\noccupy the attention of chemists, and a definite line of attack upon\r\norganic matter was recognized.\r\n\r\nTwo years later the second great step was taken. Dumas, studying the\r\naction of chlorine upon acetic acid, showed that the chlorine could\r\nreplace hydrogen atom for atom, or volume for volume, and that his\r\nobservations explained other reactions which had been unintelligible\r\nhitherto. This research led him to the famous theory of substitutions,\r\nwhich at first was received with ridicule, but soon found general\r\nacceptance. Electro-chemical conceptions, the Berzelian doctrines, were\r\nthen in vogue, and it seemed strange, even absurd, to suppose that\r\nelectro-negative chlorine could be substituted for electro-positive\r\nhydrogen. But the facts were stronger than the preconceived ideas, and\r\nthe latter soon gave way. In this discovery by Dumas the first germs of\r\nthe modern theory of valence are to be found.\r\n\r\nFor the study of inorganic substances, however, the dualistic theory\r\nwas long retained, with the result that inorganic chemistry degenerated\r\nto a great extent into analysis and compound making, without any\r\ngeneral conceptions which could stimulate scientific advance. It\r\nbecame a science of details rather than of principles, and was soon\r\novershadowed by the organic branch. In the latter, theory after theory\r\nsprang up, flourished, and died away, each one having partial truth,\r\nbut none being exhaustive and final. Still, the intellectual activity\r\nled to discoveries, and the warfare between doctrines, unlike the\r\nwarfare between men, was productive of good instead of destruction.\r\nFrom the conflict of ideas the truth gradually emerged, and a new\r\nsystem of chemical philosophy was developed. The theory of compound\r\nradicles, the nucleus theory, the theory of types, the conception of\r\nconjugated compounds, followed rapidly one after the other, until in\r\nthe discovery of valence all discrepancies were reconciled, structural\r\nchemistry came into existence, and a single doctrine, applicable alike\r\nto organic and inorganic substances, had possession of the field.\r\n\r\nThe theory of valence was a logical outgrowth from its predecessors,\r\nwhose valuable features it included in a wider generalization, but it\r\nwas the work of no one master mind. Many chemists contributed to its\r\nup-building, Frankland and Kekulé being among the leaders; but its\r\nfoundations are to be detected in the atomic theory itself, from which\r\nit is legitimately derived. To understand its full significance we must\r\ntake a step backward in history, and trace the change in atomic weights\r\nfrom their first form to the modern system.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the atomic theory, in the determinations by\r\nWollaston, Berzelius, and others, attention was chiefly paid to\r\nthe atomic weights in their aspect of combining numbers. They were\r\nprimarily of use as factors in chemical calculations, and chemists\r\nnaturally sought for their simplest expressions, with little regard to\r\ntheoretical considerations. The laws of Avogadro, of Dulong and Petit,\r\nhad, indeed, been announced, but the adjustment of the atomic weights\r\nto meet their requirements was long neglected. The importance of the\r\nadjustment was not realized, for it was obscured by the prevailing\r\ndualistic theory, but without it the deeper general relations of the\r\natoms could not appear. Accordingly, a system of chemical formulæ grew\r\nup which was based upon a deceptive apparent simplicity of ratios,\r\nand by which the theory of valence could not be even suggested. The\r\nold formula for water, HO, expressed only its composition by weight,\r\nignoring its composition by volume; it failed, therefore, to accord\r\nwith Avogadro’s law or to give the slightest hint as to the relations\r\nwhich are now covered by the conception of chemical structure. A part\r\nof the existing knowledge was accurately symbolized, but the larger\r\npart was ignored, a state of affairs which could not last, although the\r\nchange came about but slowly.\r\n\r\nThe incentive to reform came from two sources. Physics, in the\r\nkinetic theory of gases, gave a new demonstration of the truth of\r\nAvogadro’s law, and led chemists to realize more clearly than before\r\nthe distinction between atoms and molecules. Soon it was seen that the\r\nmolecule was the smallest particle of matter which could exist as such,\r\nwhile the atom was the smallest particle which could take part in any\r\nchemical change. The metaphysical atom was really the modern molecule;\r\nthe chemical atom was a new conception, due to the discoveries of\r\nchemistry alone. This distinction was found to hold good even for\r\nelementary bodies, and it became evident that free hydrogen or oxygen\r\nmust contain two atoms to the molecule, while phosphorus and arsenic\r\ncontained four. With mercury the atom and the molecule are identical,\r\nbut in most cases the greater complexity exists, and the elements as\r\nwe see them are compounds of like atoms with each other. That hydrogen\r\ncan unite with hydrogen, oxygen with oxygen, carbon with carbon, is a\r\nconception to which the early chemists never attained, but which is a\r\nnecessary consequence of Avogadro’s law in its application to observed\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nThe second impulse toward change originated in the study of organic\r\ncompounds, and gained its force from the struggle between contending\r\ntheories. The advocates of each theory sought for evidence in its\r\nfavor, and so innumerable discoveries were made, compound radicles\r\nwere recognized in great numbers, and the mass of data became so\r\noverwhelming that for a while chaos reigned. Classification of\r\ncompounds became imperatively necessary, and to that all speculation\r\nwas subordinated. In 1842 Schiel found that the alcohols formed a\r\nregular series, with progressive variation in their properties; Dumas\r\nobserved a similar relation among the fatty acids, and so something\r\nlike order began to appear.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 Charles Gerhardt proposed to use the law of Avogadro as a basis\r\nfor the determination of atomic weights. This involved the doubling of\r\nmany existing values, especially the atomic weights assigned to oxygen,\r\ncarbon, and sulphur. At first the proposition was violently opposed,\r\nand even ridiculed, but by slow degrees it managed to make its way,\r\nalthough it was not until after 1858 that it began to find anything\r\nlike general acceptance. In that year Cannizzaro put forth his revision\r\nof the atomic weights, adjusted to accord with physical laws, and a\r\nnew era in chemistry began. The modern theories of chemistry became\r\npossible, and the many researches in which they had been foreshadowed\r\nreceived a clearer meaning. Cannizzaro did not stand alone; his work\r\nwas but the capstone of a structure which had long been growing;\r\nLiebig, Dumas, Laurent, Gerhardt, Wurtz, Graham, Williamson, and\r\nFrankland were among the builders. But at last chemical and physical\r\nevidence were brought into full convergence, and each gave emphasis to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nDuring the formative period of the new doctrines, between 1840 and\r\n1858, many discoveries were made which helped toward the final\r\nconsummation. Even earlier than this the researches of Graham upon\r\nthe phosphoric acids had familiarized chemists with the idea that\r\ndifferent substances might have very different combining powers, and\r\nother polybasic acids were found to exist among organic compounds.\r\nThe discovery by Wurtz, in 1849, that the hydrogen of ammonia was\r\nreplaceable by organic radicles, forming the compound ammonias or\r\namines, was a logical extension of the theory of substitutions; and\r\nthe recognition at about the same time, by Hofmann, of ammonia as a\r\ndistinct type upon which many other substances could be modeled, was\r\nanother long step forward. In 1851 Williamson argued that nearly all\r\ninorganic and many organic molecules could be represented as analogous\r\nin structure to water, and a year later, as a result of his researches\r\nupon the organo-metallic bodies--zinc ethyl, tin ethyl, etc.--Frankland\r\nexpressed the belief that every elementary atom has a definite\r\ncombining power which limits the number of other atoms capable of\r\ndirect union with it. This was the theory of valence in its first and\r\nsimplest form, undeveloped to its consequences, but unmistakably clear.\r\nTo carbon compounds in general it was yet to be applied.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 the work of Cannizzaro appeared, and a general revision of\r\nchemical formulæ became necessary. The advanced views which a few\r\nchemists had held began to find a more general acceptance, and the\r\nsignificance of the change was gradually realized. In the same year\r\nKekulé showed that the atom of carbon had a combining capacity of\r\nfour, and furthermore that in many organic compounds the carbon atoms\r\nwere in part united with each other, and even linked, as it were, into\r\nchains. Still later, studying benzene, he found that its six carbon\r\natoms were best regarded as joined together in the form of a closed\r\nring, and with this conception the idea of chemical structure received\r\nat last a definite form. These linkages of atoms, these rings and\r\ntheir derivatives, could all be represented graphically to the eye,\r\nin accordance with the combining power of the several elements, and\r\nso the structural formulæ of modern chemistry came into vogue. Types,\r\nsubstitutions, compound radicles, were all covered by and included in\r\nthe new generalization, and each of the older theories was seen to be\r\nbut an expression of special cases, rather than of any general law. No\r\ntruth was set aside, but all were co-ordinated.\r\n\r\nTo the non-chemical reader the foregoing passages may seem vague\r\nand abstruse, but in an essay of this scope greater elaboration is\r\ninadmissible. It is clear, however, that each forward step has been a\r\nlogical development of the atomic theory, which, as we shall see later,\r\ndoes not end even here.\r\n\r\nThus, then, the chemical formulæ and atomic weights of Berzelius grew\r\nby slow degrees into the modern system, with its representations of\r\nstructure and atomic linking. The internal architecture of the molecule\r\nwas now revealed not to the imagination only, but to the eye of reason,\r\nand, speculative as the new conceptions may seem at first, they have\r\nled to astonishing practical consequences. The new formulæ at once\r\nindicated lines of research, and with their aid synthetic chemistry\r\nwas greatly stimulated. True, many syntheses of organic compounds\r\nhad already been made, but progress became more rapid and the work\r\nof discovery was systematized to a wonderful degree. In 1856 Perkin\r\ndiscovered the first of the coal-tar dyes, creating a new industry\r\nwhich has been assisted beyond measure by the structural symbols that\r\ncame into use only a few years later. In 1868 alizarin, the coloring\r\nprinciple of madder, was made artificially from the hydrocarbon\r\nanthracene; a host of other colors, a veritable chemical rainbow,\r\nhave been discovered; the synthesis of indigo has been effected; and\r\nwithin twenty years we have seen medicine enriched by a great variety\r\nof drugs, all prepared by purely chemical processes from the former\r\nwaste material--coal tar. To most of this work, at least since 1865,\r\nKekulé’s conception of the benzene ring has been the guiding clew,\r\nand it is certain that without the theory the practice would have\r\nadvanced much more slowly. Out of research for its own sake has come\r\nan enrichment of the world, which in any previous age would have been\r\ninconceivable.\r\n\r\nThe atomic theory, while replacing speculation in one sense, stimulated\r\nit in another. The human mind is always striving to get back of the\r\nknown, to see what lies beyond the limits of visibility, and the\r\nconception of an element with its atomic weight opened up a field for\r\nthe exercise of the imagination. What is an element ultimately? was\r\nan early question to ask. Are the elements really diverse, or do they\r\nmanifest but one fundamental kind of matter? To such queries the atomic\r\nweights offered a promising line for investigation, and more than one\r\nmind began traveling along it. In 1815 Prout put forth the supposition\r\nthat all atomic weights were even multiples of that assigned to\r\nhydrogen, and over this hypothesis a long warfare has raged. To-day\r\nit is practically abandoned by chemists, but the controversy which it\r\nprovoked led to some of the most accurate investigations in the history\r\nof science, and so served to give precision to our knowledge. Without\r\nthe instigation of Prout’s hypothesis, which hinted at hydrogen as\r\nthe ultimate form of matter, we might have been content with inferior\r\ndeterminations of atomic weight, and chemistry, as an exact science,\r\nwould have suffered.\r\n\r\nIn due time, however, it was perceived that the elements could\r\nbe arranged in groups, the members of each group having similar\r\nproperties and forming similar compounds. Serial relations, analogous\r\nto those discovered among organic compounds, became manifest, and\r\nmuch thought was expended in seeking to trace out their meaning. The\r\nclassification of the elements was more and more seen to be important,\r\nand regularities came to light which at first were unsuspected. Still,\r\nno general law, no one guiding principle, could be found so long as the\r\nold system of weights and formulæ was retained in common usage.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of Cannizzaro’s atomic weights and the establishment of\r\nthe theory of valence made possible a new attack upon the problem of\r\nclassification. In 1864 Newlands arranged the elements in the order of\r\ntheir atomic weights, and showed that at regular intervals there was a\r\nperiodic recurrence of certain characteristics. This observation, which\r\nforeshadowed the periodic law, was received with indifference and, to\r\nsome extent, with ridicule, but the path had been found which soon led\r\nto a great discovery. In 1869 Mendelejeff published his celebrated\r\nmemoir, and the periodic law took its place as a distinct addition to\r\nscience. Almost simultaneously Lothar Meyer announced similar views,\r\nbut independently, and controversy soon arose as to the relative merits\r\nof the two philosophers. With that controversy we have nothing to do,\r\nbut the law itself deserves our fuller attention.\r\n\r\nAccording to the periodic law, all the properties of the elements are\r\nperiodic functions of their atomic weights, varying from substance\r\nto substance in a perfectly regular manner. The elements thus fall\r\ninto periods, or octaves, as Newlands called them, of a very striking\r\ncharacter. If, for example, we start with univalent lithium, the next\r\nhigher element has a valence of two, the next of three, and then comes\r\ncarbon, whose atom is quadrivalent. Following carbon, the combining\r\npower of successive elements decreases until we reach sodium, in which\r\nsomething like the properties of lithium recur. Above sodium the same\r\nrise goes on to the fourth element higher, silicon, which resembles\r\ncarbon, and then follows the regular step-by-step falling away, to end\r\nwith chlorine, the last member of the second period. This periodic\r\nrising and falling is characteristic of all the elements, and they were\r\nso tabulated by Mendelejeff as to be perfectly clear, with a clearness\r\nwhich is not to be given by words. In Mendelejeff’s table certain gaps\r\nappeared, which he ascribed to the existence of undiscovered metals.\r\nFor three of these he predicted the properties, starting out from\r\nthe properties of their neighbors. This was a rash thing to do, but\r\nthe venture has been fully vindicated. In 1875 Lecoq de Boisbandram\r\ndiscovered gallium, which filled one of the gaps; scandium and\r\ngermanium filled the other two later. The predictions of Mendelejeff\r\nwere fulfilled; atomic weight, specific gravity, fusibility, the\r\ncharacter of the compounds to be formed, were all foreseen for each\r\nof the three new elements; and, so far as experiment has yet gone,\r\nhis anticipations have been perfectly realized. Every good theory is\r\nprophetic; but few generalizations have been so strikingly verified\r\nin this respect as has the periodic law. In spite of some outstanding\r\ndifficulties, yet to be explained, the law has served to great\r\nadvantage in the classification of the elements, and it has had much to\r\ndo with the late revival of inorganic chemistry. The latter branch of\r\nscience, long comparatively neglected, has now gained new interest, and\r\nfor it, in the near future, a great growth can be prophesied.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of the periodic law was to prove that the\r\nelements are connected with one another by general relations, and so\r\nto stimulate the belief in their possibly common origin. This view has\r\nmany upholders, although it is also strongly opposed, but the weight\r\nof argument seems to be in its favor. On philosophic grounds it is at\r\nleast more probable than the opposite opinion, which can not account\r\nin any way for the regularities which have been observed. From another\r\nsource, partly physical and partly chemical, the theory of the unity\r\nof matter has received strong support, and this statement brings us\r\nto another of the greatest discoveries made during the nineteenth\r\ncentury--that of the spectroscope and spectrum analysis.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1860 that Kirchhoff and Bunsen added this new weapon to\r\nthe arsenal of scientific research. The spectroscope itself, as\r\nan instrument, was an invention in the department of optics, but\r\nits applications to chemistry were among the most obvious and the\r\nmost startling of its achievements. With its aid new elements were\r\ndiscovered--rubidium, cæsium, thallium, indium, and gallium; in many\r\nlines of investigation it found immediate use; but, more than all, it\r\nmade possible the analysis of the heavenly bodies, and proved that the\r\nsame kinds of matter exist throughout the visible universe. Before the\r\nday of the spectroscope all speculation upon the chemistry of the stars\r\nwas in vain; with its advent the material unity of planets, suns, and\r\nnebulæ was made clear. To the astronomer, a new eye was given; to the\r\nchemist, a new laboratory. Three sciences were brought to a single\r\nfocus, and each one gained in power thereby.\r\n\r\nIn its application to what may be called chemical astronomy, one\r\nachievement of the spectroscope was particularly notable--namely, the\r\nrehabilitation of the nebular hypothesis. When the gigantic telescope\r\nof Lord Rosse had resolved some nebulæ into clusters of stars, it\r\nwas thought that all other nebulæ might be of the same character;\r\nthe visible basis of the hypothesis was gone. But the spectroscope\r\nsoon found among these celestial objects some which were truly clouds\r\nof incandescent gas, and so the nebular hypothesis received a new\r\nstanding, becoming stronger than ever before. One point, however,\r\nwas strange: these gaseous clouds were of the simplest composition;\r\nhydrogen and nitrogen were their chief constituents; how, then, could a\r\nworld like ours originate from them?\r\n\r\nFurther investigation, to which Huggins and Secchi were the chief\r\ncontributors, showed, however, that from nebula to planet there is\r\na regular, progressive order of chemical complexity. The nebulæ are\r\nsimple; in the hotter stars a few more elements appear; more still can\r\nbe detected in colored stars and the sun; but the planets, represented\r\nby our earth, are most complex of all. So far the facts; the scientific\r\nimagination now comes into play. If suns and planets were derived\r\nby a process of condensation from such nebulæ as exist to-day,\r\nperhaps the process of evolution was attended by an evolution of the\r\nchemical elements themselves. Upon that supposition the facts become\r\nintelligible; without it the evidence is not easily co-ordinated. This\r\nhint, together with the suggestions offered by the periodic law, has\r\nmade chemists more ready to consider the probable unity of matter,\r\neven though actual proof for or against the conception has not yet\r\nbeen attained. That the chemical elements are absolute and final few\r\nthinkers of to-day believe; the drift of opinion is mainly in one\r\ndirection, but no element has yet been decomposed or transmuted into\r\nanother. Some mathematical relations have been found connecting the\r\natomic weights of certain elements with the wave lengths of their\r\nspectral lines, and this field of investigation is a promising one for\r\nthe future. That the atomic weights are connected hardly admits of\r\ndoubt; to the mass of the atom its rate of vibration must be related;\r\nto that vibration the lines in the spectrum are due. The clews are\r\nobvious, and it will be strange if they do not lead to important\r\ndiscoveries ere long.\r\n\r\n[_To be concluded._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENCE OF ART FORM.\r\n\r\nBY D. CADY EATON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTaste is so free and so subjective, so largely a matter of personal\r\nfeeling, that any selection or limitation of attractive objects\r\nwould be met by plausible objection. Every honest and unprejudiced\r\ninvestigator must, however, admit nowadays that his individual taste\r\nmay be informed and purified, and that he is under obligations to\r\nbe ever ready to explain and to justify it. The day for the mere\r\nproclaiming of preference has passed. The proclamation must be\r\naccompanied by explanations which will satisfy others, if they do not\r\nconvince them, and which will be clear to one’s own understanding. The\r\nauthoritative explanation, “I like this, I dislike that,” will no more\r\npass current nor carry weight. Science has sufficiently studied the\r\nsentiments and emotions to know that they, too, are subject to laws\r\nwhich must be acknowledged and obeyed. Excitations for which there is\r\nno reasonable accounting, no justifiable source, must be relegated\r\nto the domain of folly. The reason for everything that appertains to\r\nthought and emotion, if not apparent, must be exposed and presented.\r\nArtists must explain their works to vulgar understanding. Writers must\r\nmake their criticisms plain to the humble intellect. The age in which\r\nwe live takes nothing for granted, accepts no man’s _ipse dixit_, hates\r\nshams, is intolerant of secrecy, hypocrisy, and fraud.\r\n\r\nI propose in this article, by contrasting good and bad examples, to put\r\nbefore readers a few of the simplest elements of decoration. You can\r\nhardly fail to note the differences, and when once the eye has acquired\r\nthe habit of discriminating there is no reason why there should not\r\nfollow a growth in perception which will result in delightful and\r\naugmenting artistic enjoyment. No attempt is to be made to develop a\r\nsystem, nor, of course, to cover the whole ground of the subject. The\r\nobject is simply to start perceptions in the right direction.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the ideas and the illustrations of this article are taken\r\nfrom a little work by Henri Mayeux, called _La Composition Décorative_.\r\nHenri Mayeux is Professor of Decorative Art in the École des Beaux-Arts\r\nin Paris. His work is one of the series of the _Bibliothèque de\r\nl’Enseignement des Beaux-Arts_, a series which should be among the very\r\nfirst works to be found in the library of every student of art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe very first of Mayeux’s illustrations (Fig. 1) introduces the style\r\nof the teaching of the volume and of this article. Let me translate\r\nhis accompanying description: “Here are two recipients of the same\r\nheight, made of the same material, and with about equal care. Each has\r\ntwo handles and is decorated by the same number of fillets. The one\r\nmarked _A_ is the work of an ordinary potter, without artistic instinct\r\nor education. The other, _B_, is a Greek vase of fine and delicate\r\ntaste. No one can fail to appreciate the superiority of _B_ to _A_. The\r\npurity of its profile, the graceful manner in which the handles are\r\nattached, the calculated division of the fillets, establish at once a\r\nconsiderable difference of artistic value between the two objects.” If\r\nMayeux were addressing beginners he might add that one reason why all\r\njugs and vases are round is that the shape is the easiest to make. The\r\npotter’s wheel must have been one of the very earliest inventions of\r\nsemi-civilized races. Besides, as a drop of water is globular, it seems\r\nappropriate that liquids should be contained in round receptacles. A\r\nsquare jug would not only seem inappropriate, but it would be ugly\r\nand perhaps difficult to handle. Notice in _B_ how much better the\r\ndifferent parts are distinguished: the neck from the body of the\r\nvessel, and the body of the vessel from the foot. Two fillets are also\r\nvery appropriately put where the vessel is largest, and where they seem\r\nto convey a sense of increased strength exactly where the pressure is\r\ngreatest. You will find all the way through the study of ornament that\r\nutility, or use, is a fundamental principle which can not be violated\r\nwithout impairing beauty.\r\n\r\nBefore presenting objects for comparison it may be well to pass in\r\nreview the elements which compose all objects. Decoration is the\r\napplication of ornament to form. It therefore presupposes knowledge\r\nof both form and ornament, for form must be understood by itself, and\r\nornament by itself, before the proper ornament may be selected for the\r\ngiven form. The elements of form are length, breadth, and thickness. A\r\nmathematical point is conceived to have no dimensions, a mathematical\r\nline but one, and a mathematical plane but two. But in actuality there\r\nis no tangible object without the third dimension--thickness. Still,\r\nwhere two dimensions are very much more prominent than the third--as,\r\nfor instance, in a plaque, in the side of a room, in a single\r\nelevation of a building, or whenever merely the surface of an object\r\nis viewed--the third dimension may be left out of consideration. Lines\r\nand the surfaces they bound--that is, length and breadth--are the two\r\nelements of form which play the chief part in decoration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nIf the two vases which are represented in the view by vertical and\r\nhorizontal, straight and curved lines, were actually before us you\r\nwould have difficulty in finding any vertical lines, and the horizontal\r\nlines would turn out to be circles. The lines in the view mark the\r\napparent terminations of the surfaces. For purposes of study, however,\r\nyou must regard objects of three dimensions as bounded by lines, just\r\nas they appear in photographs, drawings, or other flat representations,\r\ngeometric or perspective. In regarding objects from the point of view\r\nof decoration there is still another element to be considered; that is,\r\nthe element of material, the substance of which objects consist, for it\r\nis evident that the ornament which would be appropriate to wood, for\r\ninstance, might not be appropriate to metal or to stone. The element of\r\nmaterial is of great importance in practical decoration, but of less\r\nimportance in theoretical decoration. Lines and surfaces are therefore\r\nthe two chief elements of decoration to be considered at present.\r\nColor, being an element of an entirely independent nature, will not be\r\nconsidered at all.\r\n\r\nFirst, lines. The lines down one side of an object may be called the\r\nprofile of the object, while the lines surrounding the object may be\r\ncalled the contour or outline of the object.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nProfiles and outlines are made up of any number of straight and curved\r\nlines connected at any and every variety of angle. The view (Fig. 2)\r\nshows a few possibilities of combination of lines into profiles. The\r\nparticular thing to be observed in these profiles is that individual\r\ncurves are preceded or followed by curves which curve in the same\r\ndirection or in the opposite direction--that is, regarding the curves\r\nas concave or convex from a given side of the profile, sometimes a\r\nconcave curve meets a concave curve, sometimes it meets a convex curve.\r\nIn these particular profiles the straight lines which unite the curves\r\nare so small and so insignificant that they appear as mere connections.\r\nWhere the adjoining curves are homogeneous the connection is called\r\ncontinuous--_raccords continus_, as Mayeux puts it. When the adjoining\r\ncurves are different, the connection is called contrasted--_raccords\r\ncontrastés_. In the view all continuous connections are marked _a_; all\r\ncontrasted connections are marked _b_. Now follow these lines up and\r\ndown slowly and deliberately--not once or twice, but a number of times.\r\nSee exactly where the connections occur, and where the connections\r\nare continuous, and where they are contrasted. In these profiles are\r\nshown forth and made evident two of the most important and general laws\r\nnot only of ornament, but of all artistic composition: First, that\r\nconnected curves of the same kind must run substantially in the same\r\ndirection; and, second, that for purposes of strong contrast curves of\r\ndifferent kinds must be joined--that is to say, that where contrasted\r\nconnection is desired, the difference in direction must be abruptly\r\nand sharply indicated. In the profiles in the view the various curves\r\nhave been continued in dotted lines beyond the profiles, so as to bring\r\nout and make clear these two laws. You see that wherever there is a\r\n_b._ the dotted lines cross at, or nearly at, right angles, and that\r\nwherever there is an _a._ there is no crossing at all of the dotted\r\nlines. The essence of these two laws is of such importance in all\r\nartistic and decorative composition that beginners might well be put\r\nto drawing profiles until the principles involved have been absorbed\r\nand made a part of artistic apprehension. The profiles in the view are\r\nall pleasing, because the laws are observed. Try your hand at drawing\r\nprofiles in which the laws are not observed, and you will quickly\r\nperceive the difference. The most beautiful of pure profiles are those\r\npresented by Greek entablatures. The most beautiful of Greek outlines\r\nare those presented by Greek vases. The beauties of Greek sculpture and\r\nof renaissance design belong so strictly to the domain of pure art that\r\nthey may not be used for comparison in an article on ornament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nAs outlines are composed of profiles, the same laws govern. That\r\nthe curved line is the line of beauty stands out most evidently in\r\nthe study of antique designs. Vertical lines and horizontal lines\r\nare the lines of support and strength, and must always have proper\r\nconsideration; but in pure ornament the office of straight lines seems\r\nto be confined to connecting curves and to emphasizing their contrasts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\nThe next view (Fig. 3) is to illustrate the progress already made.\r\nOn the upper line are the three rough outline sketches for modern\r\narticles, of which the final use and destination are shown on the lower\r\nline. In the sketch to the left the fine effect is produced by a few\r\ncurves, of which the connections are boldly and finely contrasted. In\r\nthe second sketch an equally pleasing effect is produced by curves, of\r\nwhich the principal ones are continuously connected, while in the third\r\nsketch there is a pleasing exhibition of both kinds of connections.\r\nThe lower line gives you your first notion of the use of ornament in\r\nmarking and embellishing the lines of form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Contours bátards et indécis_ FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nThe next view (Fig. 4) exposes forms in which the above laws are\r\nviolated, and by whose ugliness you can not fail to be impressed. On\r\nthe top line are objects of which the curves are so weak and undecided\r\nthat it would be difficult to state whether the connections are\r\ncontinuous or contrasted. In the second line is shown how ugly is the\r\neffect when straight lines are substituted for curved lines, and in the\r\nthird line is shown how ugly effects may be produced even by curved\r\nlines when not used in obedience to some accepted and apprehended\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nThere is another presentation of form which is in reality but a\r\nmodification of profile, but which, because it looks as if it had\r\nbeen separately applied, and also because it is separately treated\r\nin books, must be considered by itself. The term “molding” has been\r\ngiven to variations in surfaces which have both useful and ornamental\r\nuses. Moldings are as old as architecture, and vary with schools of\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nIn the next view (Fig. 5), taken from Mayeux’s work, are given the most\r\nordinary Greek moldings with their French names. However necessary it\r\nmust be for the architect, and however admirable it may be for the art\r\nstudent, to know the names of all moldings by heart and to be able\r\nto describe each one accurately, such proficiency is not required at\r\npresent and is not necessary for the understanding of the present\r\ntheme. Some moldings have square edges, some round. The curved edges\r\nof some are simple, of others complex. Each has its name, and of some\r\nthe name is descriptive. The term molding would seem to indicate that\r\nmoldings were made apart and subsequently applied to the main object.\r\nWhatever be the origin of moldings, the same rules apply to them which\r\napply to other profiles, with the additional rule that moldings must\r\nalways be kept subordinate to the principal object. For instance, in\r\nthe view (Fig. 6) the pedestal marked _bon_ is good, because the body\r\nof the pedestal is the principal object and it is clearly seen that\r\nthe moldings at the base and at the top are subordinate and merely\r\nornamental, while the pedestal marked _mauvais_ is decidedly bad,\r\nbecause more vertical space is given to the moldings than to the shaft,\r\nconfusing outline, weakening the shaft, and destroying the sense of\r\nstrong and steady support.\r\n\r\nReaders may at once make use of the information already acquired by\r\nseeing how these rules apply to their own lamps, candlesticks, pieces\r\nof furniture, etc.\r\n\r\nThe next view (Fig. 7) shows incidentally how much better it is under\r\nall circumstances to mark with fillets and lines the changes from one\r\ncurve to another, for you certainly see how much more substantial\r\ncharacter and beauty has _B_ than _A_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nFinally, let it be said, and said emphatically, that though there\r\nare profiles which require the use of the compass to draw them, and\r\nthough all architectural details must be worked out with mathematical\r\naccuracy, those profiles and outlines are the most beautiful where it\r\nis evident that artistic skill governing a free hand has controlled and\r\nwhere mechanical assistance is so subordinate as to be overlooked.\r\n\r\nThere is very little to be said about surfaces or forms of two\r\ndimensions. The principal requirement is that outlines should be\r\nagreeable and must be well defined. In fact, the two qualities are\r\ninseparable, for a well-defined outline is agreeable and a badly\r\ndefined one is sure to be disagreeable. By well-defined is meant\r\nthat its particular shape should easily appear and be clearly\r\ndistinguishable. For instance, a square should appear with sides\r\ndistinctly equal; a circle should have but one center. In an\r\narchitectural opening either arch or entablature should prevail, and\r\nthe character of the arch should be evident. In the examples presented\r\n(Fig. 8) in the view these principles are violated. The first figure\r\nis so clearly a square that at first, and before you have examined\r\nit closely, you think it is a square. It leaves an indefinite and\r\nconsequently disagreeable impression. The same criticism applies to\r\nthe second object, apparently a mirror. The glass is round, but the\r\nframe is so irregular that the impress of the circle is destroyed, and\r\nthere is left an undecided and therefore uncomfortable sensation. In\r\nthe third example the arch is so poorly defined and so weak, while the\r\nentablature above it is so strong and so prominent, that the result\r\nis a composition that fails to give pleasure, because no distinct\r\nidea is conveyed. In the last example the outlines of the arch are so\r\nindefinite that its character is indistinguishable. You can not see\r\nwhich prevails, the round arch or the pointed arch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\nThe same principles apply to smaller objects and to details, as seen\r\nin the next view (Fig. 9). To the left the date plate on top is bad\r\nin comparison with the one beneath it, because its direction is not\r\nso well marked and its corner projections are too large. In the\r\nlambrequins on the right, those are good in which the general direction\r\nis properly marked, and in which subdivisions are kept properly\r\nsubordinated. Lambrequins have so entirely gone out of use nowadays\r\nthat it is difficult to recall the time when they were regarded as\r\nindispensable parts of furniture.\r\n\r\nThere is one other point to which your attention should be called--that\r\nis, stability. If an object be intended to stand, its center of\r\ngravity should be so well within its base that there will be no danger\r\nof its being upset by the ordinary uses to which it is exposed. Pots\r\nand pans, pitchers, lamps, and candlesticks, of general and daily\r\nhousehold use, should have bases so broad and weight so low that the\r\naccidental bump of the inexperienced “help” will not be inevitably\r\nfatal.\r\n\r\nWhen utensils are made more for show than for use, as those in Fig.\r\n10, and are to occupy places of comparative security, beauty more than\r\nutility may be considered in the proportions of their supports. Where\r\nutility has disappeared altogether and the suggested outline of a vase,\r\nfor instance, is used for purely ornamental purpose, supports may be\r\ndone away with altogether, as appears in these drawings of Italian\r\ntapestries of the seventeenth century (Fig. 11).\r\n\r\nThe stability of pendant objects must also be considered. It is\r\nevident that the perpendicular line of suspension must be the line of\r\nequilibrium, and that these two must correspond with the design (Fig.\r\n12). Whether any objects should under any circumstances be exposed to\r\nthe real and apparent danger of falling is a question. We have got so\r\ninto the habit of hanging pictures, engravings, and other works of art\r\nin our houses, and of seeing them hung in galleries, that we have lost\r\nsight of the incongruity of the custom. Pictures should be impaneled,\r\nand be permanent parts of the walls on which they appear. But, then,\r\nhow could they be moved when owners tire of them, or tire of their\r\nhouses, or how could they be gathered together in museums for purposes\r\nof study and public enjoyment? Picture frames are of comparatively\r\nmodern invention. The idea of buying a picture for the purpose of\r\nselling it again was not entertained before the fifteenth century.\r\nPictures were as substantial parts of churches and houses as were\r\nshrines and fireplaces.\r\n\r\nHaving very cursively reviewed the elements of form, we are in a\r\nposition to understand decoration, which is simply the application to\r\nform of ornament.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The highest authenticated points at which flowering plants have\r\n    heretofore been found growing upon the Andes are at about 17,000\r\n    feet, although the Kew Herbarium contains several specimens labeled\r\n    as having been found at altitudes of from 17,000 to 18,000 feet.\r\n    Sir Martin Conway has brought back from his recent explorations in\r\n    the Bolivian mountains at least half a dozen species from 18,000\r\n    feet and upward, the highest being from about 18,500 feet. They\r\n    include a saxifrage, a mallow, a valerian, and several _Compositæ_.\r\n    _Compositæ_ likewise attain the upper limit of phanerogamous\r\n    vegetation in Thibet, where, in latitudes from 30° to 34°, one was\r\n    found by Dr. Thorold at 19,000 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEAM TURBINES AND HIGH-SPEED VESSELS.[F]\r\n\r\nBY THE HON. CHARLES A. PARSONS, F. R. S.\r\n\r\n    [F] Abstract of the Presidential Address to the Institution of\r\n        Junior Engineers, November 3, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll heat engines at present in use take in heat from a source at a\r\nhigh temperature and discharge most of it at a lower temperature, the\r\ndisappearance of heat in the process being the equivalent of the work\r\ndone by the engine. In all cases at the present time the source of heat\r\nis from fuel of some kind, and after working the engine the residue\r\nis discharged in the case of the steam engine either to the condenser\r\nor in the exhaust steam when non-condensing. In the gas engine it is\r\ndischarged in the waste gases and into the water jacket around the\r\ncylinder.\r\n\r\nThe earliest records of heat engines are found in the Pneumatics of\r\nHero of Alexandria, about 200 B. C. He describes a reaction steam\r\nturbine, a spherical vessel mounted on axes supplied with steam through\r\none of the trunnions from a boiler beneath; the steam escaping through\r\ntwo nozzles diametrically opposite to each other and tangential to the\r\nsphere, causing the sphere to rotate by the reaction or momentum of the\r\nissuing steam, and analogous to a Barker’s water wheel.\r\n\r\nThus, the first engine deriving its motive power from fuel was a\r\ncrude form of steam turbine, and though it could have been applied to\r\nuseful work, and could easily have been made sufficiently economical\r\nto replace manual and horse power in many instances, yet it lay\r\ndormant till 1629 A. D., when Bianca suggested the same principle in\r\na different form. Bianca’s steam turbine consisted simply of a steam\r\njet fed from a boiler impinging against vanes or paddles attached to\r\nthe rim of a wheel which was blown round by the momentum of the steam\r\nissuing from the jet.\r\n\r\nThe piston engine is, however, of comparatively modern origin, and\r\ndates from about the year 1700 A. D. Engines of this class are so well\r\nknown that it suffices to say that they have been practically the sole\r\nmotive-power engines from fuel in use from 1700 up to 1845, and have\r\nconstituted one of the most important factors in the development of\r\nmodern engineering enterprise.\r\n\r\nAir engines were introduced about the year 1845, and although the\r\nlarger engines of the Stirling type were very economical in fuel, yet,\r\non account of the inherent difficulty of heating large volumes of air\r\nwithin metal chambers or pipes--a difficulty arising from the low\r\nconductibility of air and consequently the overheating and burning\r\nof the metal--they have only come into commercial use for very small\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--LONGITUDINAL DIAGRAM OF PARSONS’S STEAM\r\nTURBINE, WITH SIDE OF CONTAINING CASE REMOVED. The construction of\r\nthe blades and guide vanes is more clearly shown in Fig. 2. The steam\r\nenters at _J_ and exhausts after leaving the low-pressure cylinder _C_.]\r\n\r\nDuring the last thirty-five years gas engines have been perfected, and\r\nmore recently oil engines, and in point of efficiency both convert\r\na somewhat larger percentage of the heat energy of the fuel into\r\nmechanical energy than the best steam engines. All successful oil and\r\ngas engines are at present internal-combustion engines, the fuel being\r\nburned in a gaseous form inside the working cylinder.\r\n\r\nVery numerous attempts have, however, been made to construct\r\ninternal-combustion engines to burn solid fuel instead of gas. Some\r\nhave been so far successful as to work with good economy in fuel,\r\nbut the bar to their commercial success has been the cutting of the\r\ncylinder and valves by fine particles of fuel. This difficulty is not\r\npresent when the fuel is introduced in the gaseous or liquid form, and\r\nhence the success of gas and oil engines; but could this difficulty be\r\novercome, the solid fuel would be the cheaper to use.\r\n\r\nInternal-combustion engines, gas engines, oil engines, cannon, etc.,\r\nowe their superior economy in fuel to the very high temperature at\r\nwhich the heat is transferred from the fuel to the working substance\r\nof the engine, and consequently the great range of temperature in the\r\nworking substance of the engine. In steam engines the temperature is\r\nlimited by the practical difficulties of deterioration of metal and\r\nmaterials involved in the construction.\r\n\r\nAbout fifteen years ago I was led by circumstances to investigate\r\nthe subject of improving the steam turbine. In recent times several\r\nattempts had been made to apply steam turbine wheels of the Hero and\r\nBianca types to the driving of circular saws and fans. The velocity\r\nof rotation with either of these types must necessarily be very high\r\nin order to obtain a reasonable efficiency from the steam, a velocity\r\nmuch in excess of that suitable for the direct driving of almost all\r\nclasses of machinery; gearing was considered objectionable, and it\r\ntherefore appeared desirable to adopt some form of turbine in which the\r\nsteam should be gradually expanded in small steps or drops in pressure\r\nso as to keep the velocity of flow sufficiently low to allow of a\r\ncomparatively moderate speed of rotation of the turbine engine.\r\n\r\nThe method adopted was to gather a number of turbines of the parallel\r\nflow type on to one shaft and contained in one case, the turbines\r\neach consisting of a ring of guide and a ring of moving blades, the\r\nsuccessive rings of blades or turbines being graduated in size, those\r\nnearer the exhaust end being larger than those near the steam inlet, so\r\nas to allow a gradual expansion of the steam during its passage through\r\nthe turbines.\r\n\r\nThe form of the turbine was that of a rotating drum, with outwardly\r\nprojecting rings of blades which nearly touched the containing\r\ncylindrical case, and on the case inwardly projecting rings of guide\r\nblades which nearly touched the drum. In the first examples of the\r\nengine there were two groups of turbines right-and left-handed on each\r\nside of the steam inlet, the exhaust taking place at each end of the\r\nturbine case, so as to completely balance end pressure from the steam.\r\nMore recently one series of turbines only has been used, those on\r\nthe other side of the steam inlet being replaced by packing rings or\r\nrotating balance pistons which balance the end pressure and divert the\r\nwhole of the steam through the turbines on the other side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2 SHOWS THE ARRANGEMENT OF MOVING BLADES AND GUIDE\r\nVANES IN A PARSONS’S TURBINE. The top outer cover has been removed.\r\nThe cylinder containing the revolving barrel has, as will be seen, a\r\ngreater internal diameter than the diameter of the drum. It is the\r\nannular space thus formed through which the steam flows and which\r\ncontains the revolving blades and the fixed guide blades. Between each\r\ntwo rings of moving blades there is a ring of guide blades, the latter\r\nbeing keyed into the containing case. The vanes are set at an angle, so\r\nthat the steam acts on them as wind on the sails of a windmill.]\r\n\r\nThe steam entering the annular space between the shaft and the case\r\npasses firstly through a ring of guide blades attached to the case,\r\nand is given a rotational direction of flow; it then passes to the\r\nsucceeding ring of blades attached to the shaft, by which its direction\r\nof rotation is reversed, thereby impressing the difference of its\r\nrotational momentum in torque to the shaft. The steam then passes to\r\nthe second ring of guide blades, and the process is repeated, and so\r\non, gradually expanding by small increments at each ring of blades; the\r\nsucceeding rings of blades get longer and wider, and at intervals the\r\ndiameter of the turbine drums, cylinders, and rings are also increased.\r\nIn condensing turbine engines of the larger size an expansion ratio in\r\nthe turbines of one hundredfold and upward is attained before the steam\r\npasses to the exhaust pipe and condenser.\r\n\r\nThe loss of power present in engines of the piston class, due to\r\ncylinder condensation arising from the variation of steam pressure\r\nin the cylinder, is not present in the steam turbine, as the steam\r\npressure remains constant at each turbine ring and each part of the\r\ncylinder and barrel, and the numerous tests of steam consumption that\r\nhave been made have shown that compound steam turbine engines of\r\nmoderate sizes when working with a condenser are comparable in steam\r\nconsumption per effective horse power with the best compound or triple\r\ncondensing steam engines of the piston type. They have been constructed\r\nin sizes up to about one thousand horse power for driving alternators\r\nand dynamos, and several sets of about two thousand horse power are\r\nnearing completion.\r\n\r\nThe application of the compound steam turbine to the propulsion of\r\nvessels is a subject of considerable general interest, in view of the\r\npossible and probable general adoption of this class of engine in fast\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nIn the turbine is found an engine of extremely light weight, with a\r\nperfectly uniform turning moment, and very economical in steam in\r\nproportion to the power developed, and, further, it can be perfectly\r\nbalanced so that no perceptible vibration is imparted to the ship. The\r\nproblem of proportioning the engine to the screw propellers and to the\r\nship to be driven has been the subject of costly experiments extending\r\nover several years, with the result that a satisfactory solution has\r\nbeen found, giving very economical results in regard to pounds of\r\nsteam consumed in the engines per effective horse power developed in\r\npropelling the vessel, results which are equal or superior to those so\r\nfar obtained with triple-expansion engines of ordinary type in torpedo\r\nboats or torpedo-boat destroyers. The arrangement adopted may be best\r\ndescribed by saying that instead of placing, as usual, one engine to\r\ndrive one screw shaft, the turbine engine is divided into two, three,\r\nor sometimes more separate turbines, each driving a separate screw\r\nshaft, the steam passing successively through these turbines; thus\r\nwhen there are three turbines driving three shafts, the steam from the\r\nboiler passes through the high-pressure turbine, thence through the\r\nintermediate, and lastly through the low, and thence to the condenser.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--A SEVENTY-FIVE KILOWATT TURBINE ENGINE DIRECTLY\r\nCONNECTED TO A DYNAMO. The turbine engine is on the right.]\r\n\r\nAs to the propellers, these approach closely to the usual form. It has,\r\nhowever, been found best to place two propellers of approximately the\r\nsame pitch on each shaft at some considerable distance apart, so that\r\nthe after one shall not be seriously affected by the wash of the one\r\nin front. The advantage of this arrangement is that a sufficient blade\r\narea is obtained to carry the thrust necessary to drive the vessel with\r\na lesser diameter of propeller, and so permitting of a higher speed of\r\nrevolution of the engines.\r\n\r\nThe problem was complicated by the question of cavitation, which,\r\nthough previously anticipated, was first practically found to exist\r\nby Mr. Thornycroft and Mr. Barnaby in 1894, and by them it was\r\nexperimentally determined that cavitation, or the hollowing out of the\r\nwater into vacuous spaces and vortices by the blades of the propeller,\r\ncommences to take place when the mean thrust pressure on the projected\r\narea of the blades exceeds eleven pounds and a quarter per square\r\ninch. This limit has since been corroborated during the trials of the\r\nTurbinia.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon has also been further investigated in the case of\r\nmodel propellers working in an oval tank of water, and to permit of\r\ncavitation at more moderate speeds than would otherwise have been\r\nnecessary, the following arrangement was adopted: The tank was closed,\r\nplate-glass windows being provided on each side, through which the\r\npropeller could be observed, and the atmospheric pressure was removed\r\nfrom the surface of the water by an air pump; under this condition the\r\nonly forces tending to prevent cavitation were the small head of water\r\nabove the propeller, and capillary attraction.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a propeller of two inches in diameter, cavitation\r\ncommenced at about twelve hundred revolutions, and became very\r\npronounced at fifteen hundred. Had the atmospheric pressure not been\r\nremoved, speeds of twelve thousand and fifteen thousand respectively\r\nwould have been necessary.\r\n\r\nPhotographs were taken with a camera made for the purpose, with a focal\r\nplane shutter giving an exposure of about one thousandth of a second,\r\nthe illumination being by sunlight concentrated on the propeller from a\r\ntwenty-four-inch concave mirror.\r\n\r\nPhotographs were also taken by intermittent illumination of the\r\npropeller from an arc lamp, the arrangement consisting of an ordinary\r\nlantern condenser, which projected the beam on to a small concave\r\nmirror, mounted on a prolongation of the propeller shaft, the reflected\r\nbeam being caught by a small stationary concave mirror at a definite\r\nposition in each revolution and reflected on to the propeller. By this\r\nmeans the propeller was illuminated in a definite position at each\r\nrevolution, and to the eye it appeared as stationary. The cavities\r\nabout the blades could also be clearly seen and traced, the photographs\r\nbeing taken with an ordinary camera and about ten seconds’ exposure.\r\n\r\nA series of experiments was also made with model propellers in water\r\nat and just below the boiling point, dynamometric measurements being\r\ntaken of power and thrust with various widths of propeller blade, the\r\nconclusion arrived at being that wide and thin blades are essential for\r\nfast speeds at sea, as well as a coarse pitch ratio of propeller.\r\n\r\nThe first vessel fitted with steam turbine machinery was the Turbinia.\r\nShe was commenced in 1894, and, after many alterations and preliminary\r\ntrials, was satisfactorily completed in the spring of 1897. Her\r\nprincipal features are: Length, one hundred feet; beam, nine feet;\r\nfive-foot draught of water under the propellers; forty-four tons and\r\na half displacement on trial; she is fitted with a water-tube boiler\r\nof eleven hundred feet total heating surface, and forty-two square\r\nfeet of grate area, with closed stoke-holds supplied with air from a\r\ncentrifugal fan mounted on a prolongation of the low-pressure turbine\r\nshaft. The engines consist of three compound steam turbines, high\r\npressure, intermediate, and low pressure, each driving one screw shaft;\r\non each of the shafts are three propellers, making nine in all; the\r\ncondenser is of the usual type, and has four thousand square feet of\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nWhen officially tested by Professor Ewing, F. R. S., assisted by\r\nProfessor Dunkerley, she attained a mean speed on a measured mile of\r\nthirty-two knots and three quarters, and the consumption of steam\r\nfor all purposes was computed to be fourteen pounds and a half per\r\nindicated horse power of the main engines. Subsequently, after some\r\nsmall alterations to the steam pipe, she was further pressed, and is\r\nestimated to have reached the speed of thirty-four knots and a half.\r\nShe was, and still is, therefore, the fastest vessel afloat; she has\r\nbeen out in very rough weather, is an excellent sea boat, and at all\r\nspeeds there is an almost complete absence of vibration.\r\n\r\nIn the Turbinia the exceptional speed results principally from two\r\ncauses: 1. The engines, screws, and shafting are exceptionally light.\r\n2. The economy of steam in the main engines is greater than usual.\r\n\r\nAt full speed the steam pressure in the boiler is two hundred and ten\r\npounds; at the engines, one hundred and seventy-five; and the vacuum in\r\nthe condenser twenty-seven inches, representing an expansion ratio in\r\nthe turbines of about one hundred and ten after allowance has been made\r\nfor wire-drawing in the exhaust pipe.\r\n\r\nThe first vessels of larger size than the Turbinia to be fitted with\r\nsteam turbine machinery are the torpedo-boat destroyer Viper for\r\nthe British Government, and a similar vessel for Messrs. Sir W. G.\r\nArmstrong, Whitworth & Company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--THE TURBINIA RUNNING ABOUT FORTY MILES AN HOUR.]\r\n\r\nThese vessels are of approximately the same dimensions as the\r\nthirty-knot destroyers now in her Majesty’s service, but have slightly\r\nmore displacement. The boilers are about twelve per cent larger,\r\nand it is estimated that upward of ten thousand horse power will be\r\nrealized under the usual conditions, as against sixty-five hundred with\r\nreciprocating engines.\r\n\r\nThe engines of these vessels are in duplicate. Two screw shafts are\r\nplaced on each side of the vessel, driven respectively by a high- and\r\na low-pressure turbine; to each of the low-pressure turbine shafts\r\na small reversing turbine is permanently coupled for going astern,\r\nthe estimated speed astern being fifteen knots and a half, and ahead\r\nthirty-five knots; two propellers are placed on each shaft.[G]\r\n\r\n    [G] On her second trial trip the Viper attained a mean speed of\r\n        34.8 knots, her fastest trial being over 35 knots, or about\r\n        41 statute miles per hour, with an indicated horse power of\r\n        11,000. This vessel is of about 350 tons displacement.\r\n\r\nThe latter of these two vessels has commenced her preliminary trials,\r\nand has already reached a speed of thirty-two knots. The manipulation\r\nof the engines is a comparatively simple matter, as to reverse it is\r\nonly necessary to close one valve and open another, and, owing to there\r\nbeing no dead centers, small graduations of speed can be easily made.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the general application of turbine machinery to large\r\nships, the conditions appear to be more favorable in the case of the\r\nfaster class of vessels such as cross-Channel boats, faster passenger\r\nvessels, cruisers, and liners; in such vessels the reduction in weight\r\nof machinery, as well as economy in the consumption of coal per horse\r\npower, are important factors in the case, and in some vessels the\r\nabsence of vibration, both as regards the comfort of passengers, and in\r\nthe case of ships of war permitting greater accuracy in sighting of the\r\nguns, is a question of first importance.\r\n\r\nAs regards cross-Channel boats, the turbine system presents advantages\r\nin speed, absence of vibration, and, owing to the smaller diameter of\r\nthe propellers, reduced draught.\r\n\r\nAs an instance, a boat of two hundred and seventy feet length,\r\nthirty-three feet beam, one thousand tons displacement, and eight\r\nfeet six inches draught of water could be constructed with spacious\r\naccommodation for six hundred passengers, and with machinery developing\r\neighteen thousand horse power; she will have a sea speed of about\r\nthirty knots, as compared with the speed of nineteen to twenty-two\r\nknots of the present vessels of similar size and accommodation.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, interesting to examine the possibilities of speed\r\nthat might be attained in a special unarmored cruiser, a magnified\r\ntorpedo-boat destroyer of light build, with scanty accommodation\r\nfor her large crew, but equipped with an armament of light guns and\r\ntorpedoes. Let us assume that her dimensions are about double those of\r\nthe thirty-knot destroyers, with plates of double the thickness and\r\nspecially strengthened to correspond with the increased size--length,\r\nfour hundred and twenty feet; beam, forty-two feet; maximum draught,\r\nfourteen feet; displacement, twenty-eight hundred tons; indicated\r\nhorse power, eighty thousand; there would be two tiers of water-tube\r\nboilers; these, with the engine space, coal bunkers, etc., would occupy\r\nthe whole of the lower portion of the vessel; the crew’s quarters and\r\nguns would be on the upper decks. There would be eight propellers of\r\nnine feet in diameter revolving at about four hundred revolutions per\r\nminute, and her speed would be about forty-four knots.\r\n\r\nShe could carry coal at this speed for about eight hours, but she would\r\nbe able to steam at from ten to fourteen knots with a small section\r\nof the boilers more economically than other vessels of ordinary type\r\nand power, and, when required, all the boilers could be used, and full\r\npower exerted in about half an hour.\r\n\r\nIn the case of an Atlantic liner or a cruiser of large size, turbine\r\nengines would appear to present some considerable advantages. In the\r\nfirst place they would effect a reduction in weight of machinery and\r\nsome increase in economy of fuel per horse power developed, both thus\r\ntending either to a saving in coal on the one hand, or, if preferred,\r\nsome increase in speed.\r\n\r\nThe advantages are, however, less pronounced in this class of vessel on\r\naccount of the smaller relative power of the machinery and the large\r\nquantity of coal necessary for long voyages, but the complete absence\r\nof vibration at all speeds, not to mention many minor considerations\r\nof saving in cost and reduced engine-room staff, are questions of\r\nconsiderable importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SURVIVAL OF MEDIÆVAL CREDULITY.\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR E. P. EVANS.\r\n\r\n[_Concluded._]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth year of her age Miss Diana Vaughan joined the\r\nFreemasons, entering the lodge (“triangle”) of “The Eleven Seven,” at\r\nLouisville, and passing rapidly through the different grades until\r\nthe “Elect Palladistic Knighthood” was conferred upon her after she\r\nhad given satisfactory proofs of her Luciferian orthodoxy. One thing\r\nshe refused to do--namely, to stab the host with a dagger--since\r\nthis act implied a recognition of the sacramental character of the\r\nEucharist. She maintained that there would be no sense in piercing the\r\nconsecrated wafer unless it was believed to be the real body of Christ;\r\nbut as she rejected the doctrine of transubstantiation as a childish\r\nsuperstition, she was unwilling to make a fool of herself by assaulting\r\na piece of ordinary bread with a show of wrath. She would not hesitate\r\nto commit sacrilege, but did object to being silly. This scruple, or\r\nrather this lively sense of the ridiculous, rendered her unpopular with\r\nthe Freemasons, inasmuch as it marred the performance of their most\r\nimportant and impressive Satanic ceremony, and thus gave her rival,\r\nSophia Walder, an advantage, which she was quick to improve.\r\n\r\nWe need not follow the career of Sophia Walder, known to the infernals\r\nas Sophia Sapho. She is said to have been born in Strasburg, September\r\n29, 1863, as the supposititious daughter of a Protestant parson,\r\nPhilias Walder, and a Rosicrucian dame, Ida Jacobsen, with whom the\r\nclergyman lived after having murdered his wife in Copenhagen. Her\r\nreal father, however, was the devil Bitru, who declared her to be\r\nthe predestined great-grandmother of antichrist. In 1896, while in\r\nJerusalem, she gave birth to a daughter, the grandmother of antichrist;\r\nthis child was also of demoniac paternity. Owing to her uncompromising\r\nLuciferianism, she was a favorite of the Freemasons, and excited the\r\njealousy of Diana Vaughan, who tells with zest of the practical jokes\r\nplayed on her. Thus, at a banquet of the Freemasons, somebody put a few\r\ndrops of Lourdes water in her glass of lemonade, which caused terrible\r\npain and threw her into spasms, from which she finally found relief by\r\nvomiting fire. This incident is cited by a Catholic writer, Dr. Michael\r\nGermanus,[H] in his Secrets of Hell (_Geheimnisse der Hölle_), as\r\nconclusive proof that “Sophia was possessed.”\r\n\r\n    [H] Michael Germanus (a Latinization of “_Der deutsche\r\n        Michel_,” the personification of the German nation,\r\n        analogous to the English “John Bull” and the American\r\n        “Brother Jonathan”) is the pseudonym of a priest, Parson\r\n        Künzle, of Feldkirch, in the Tyrolese Voralberg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBitru’s proclamation of Sophia Sapho as the prospective\r\ngreat-grandmother of the incarnate antichrist is given in full. It\r\nwas dictated in Latin by Bitru at a meeting of Freemasons in Italy,\r\nand written down by Luigi Revello, and bears the devil’s signature,\r\ncomposed of Satanic signs and symbols, darts, sword, cords, lightning,\r\nbugle-horn, trident, and crowing cock.\r\n\r\nThis climax of absurdity ought to have served to expose the trickery\r\nand trumpery of the whole affair, but it produced the very opposite\r\neffect. Dr. Germanus refers to “Bitru’s sign-manual as highly\r\ninteresting,” and characterizes “the documentary evidence as thoroughly\r\nconvincing”; those who refuse to recognize the truth in the face of\r\nsuch positive proof he accuses of imitating the ostrich and willfully\r\nshutting their eyes to the light.[I]\r\n\r\n    [I] A photographic reproduction of this document is given in\r\n        Diana Vaughan’s biography of the Italian statesman Crispi,\r\n        which contains numerous illustrations and portraits of\r\n        Crispi, Mazzini, Lemmi, Garibaldi, Giordano Bruno, and\r\n        other “Palladists,” or Masonic worshipers of Satan. The\r\n        original French title of the book is “Le 33ᵉ ⁂ Crispi. Un\r\n        Palladiste Homme d’État démasqué. Biographie documentée du\r\n        Héros depuis sa Naissance jusqu’ à sa deuxième Mort. Par\r\n        Miss Diana Vaughan.”\r\n\r\nThe salvation of Diana Vaughan is described as due to her intense\r\nadmiration for Joan of Arc, a feeling which was ardently fostered by\r\nthe priests with whom she chanced to come in contact. One day, as she\r\nwas attended by Asmodeus, Astaroth, Beelzebub, and Moloch, incarnate in\r\n“the counterfeit presentment” of fine gentlemen, she obeyed a sudden\r\nand irresistible impulse to invoke the Maid of Orleans, when these\r\ndevils were immediately stripped of their disguise, and stood before\r\nher in their true character as imps of hell, with hoofs and horns, and\r\nemitted an intolerable stench. No sooner did they perceive that they\r\nwere unmasked than they vanished with a fearful howl. This miracle\r\nmade a deep impression upon her, and led to her conversion. She took\r\nrefuge in a Parisian cloister, and, after severe penance and proper\r\ninstruction, was received into the bosom of the Catholic Church. During\r\nthis period of penitential seclusion she wrote her Memoirs, which\r\nproduced an immense sensation in clerical circles, and were pronounced\r\nby a high ecclesiastical dignitary to be “worth more than their weight\r\nin gold.”\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that in weaving this tissue of fabrications Taxil\r\nshowed consummate skill as a romancer and a profound knowledge of the\r\npossibilities of human credulity. He made a happy hit in calling the\r\nheroine of his Stygian story Diana, since in the annals of witchcraft\r\nthe pagan goddess of the chase is wont to frequent the nocturnal\r\nassemblies of demons, and in mediæval theology the phrase “_congressus\r\nSabathi cum Diana_” was a common expression for intercourse with\r\nSatan. Another masterly stroke was to represent her deliverance from\r\nthe snares of evil spirits and the hallucinations of Luciferianism\r\nas a miracle of grace wrought through the mediation of Joan of Arc,\r\nthus furnishing an argument in favor of the canonization of the Maid\r\nof Orleans, which the cleverest _advocatus diaboli_ would be unable\r\nto answer. At this time Taxil prepared also a Catholic prayer book\r\nentitled _Eucharistic Novena_, published under the name of Diana\r\nVaughan, and containing forms of supplication against unbelief,\r\nworldly indifference and lukewarmness, hardness of heart, blasphemy,\r\nand unchastity. The covert sarcasm which pervades the entire manual\r\nof devotion comes out most clearly in the section on the violation of\r\nthe seventh commandment. A copy of the work, which had been approved\r\nby the Archbishop of Genoa, was sent to Cardinal Parocchi, with a\r\nletter signed “Your Eminence’s most devoted servant in Jesus, Mary, and\r\nJoseph, Diana Vaughan,” and five hundred francs, of which two hundred\r\nand fifty were to be used for organizing an international antimasonic\r\ncongress, and the rest to be given as Peter’s pence to the Pope. The\r\ncardinal replied with great cordiality to his “dear daughter in our\r\nLord,” called her conversion “one of the most glorious triumphs of\r\ngrace,” and added, “I am reading at this very moment your Memoirs with\r\nburning interest.” He gave her his blessing, and conveyed “the thanks\r\nand special benediction of his Holiness.” Numerous letters of a like\r\ncharacter were received from the Vatican. On May 27, 1896, the General\r\nSecretary of the Apostolic See, Verzichi, wrote that “his Holiness\r\nhad read her _Eucharistic Novena_ with extreme pleasure”; two months\r\nlater the Pope’s private secretary, Vincenzo Sardi, thanked her in the\r\nname of Leo XIII for her exposure of Crispi, and bade her “continue to\r\nwrite and to unmask the godless sect,” and the _Civiltà Cattolica_,\r\nthe official organ of the papacy, praised her “inexhaustibleness in\r\nprecious revelations, which are unparalleled for their accuracy and\r\nusefulness. Freemasonry is confounded, and seeks to evade the blows\r\nof the valiant championess by denying her existence, and treating her\r\nas a myth. It is a pitiable shift, but Freemasonry can find no better\r\nrefuge.” “Your pen and your piety,” wrote Monsignore Villard, October\r\n15, 1896, “are predestined to demolish the foes of mankind. The good\r\nworks of the saints have always met with opposition, and it is no\r\nwonder, therefore, that yours should be combated.”\r\n\r\nNaturally, there was intense curiosity to see this new convert and\r\npowerful defender of the faith. This inquisitiveness was easily allayed\r\nat first by the plea that the cloister to which she had retired must\r\nbe kept secret, in order that she might be safe from assassination\r\nby the Freemasons. Meanwhile the medium of correspondence was a\r\nbright American girl, employed as copyist in a Parisian typewriting\r\nestablishment, who wrote all the letters at Taxil’s dictation, and\r\nreceived a monthly salary of one hundred and fifty francs for her\r\nservices. After a time he deemed it politic to introduce her privately\r\nto select circles of Catholics, who were thereby enabled to testify\r\nto her existence, since they had seen and conversed with her. The\r\nfollowing incident may be mentioned to illustrate the adroitness with\r\nwhich she played her part: M. Pierre Lautier states that he once\r\nbreakfasted with her, and offered to pour a little Chartreuse into\r\nher coffee, but she refused it with a singular sign of aversion, and\r\ntook a few drops of old cognac instead. As an ex-Luciferian, she\r\ninstinctively shrank from a drink made in a cloister, or what she\r\ncalled “an Adonaïc liquor.” That she should have thought of such a\r\nfeint on the spur of the moment indicates that she had not only made a\r\nthorough study of her rôle, but also had been endowed by Nature with\r\ngenuine theatrical talent. A full account of the solemn sham, published\r\nin the _Revue Mensuelle_, served to strengthen the faith of waverers in\r\nthe reality of Diana Vaughan, and furnished an admirable opportunity\r\nfor discoursing on the difficulty of throwing off Satanic influences;\r\nfor here was a young lady who, although she had received absolution\r\nand thus become a child of grace, could not forget the terrible effect\r\nof a few drops of Lourdes water on one of her former demonolatrous\r\nassociates, and recoiled with horror from a glass of Chartreuse. Taxil\r\nand his confederates confess that they often “doubled up with laughter”\r\nover the success of their imposture, and indulged in jokes about it in\r\ntheir writings. Thus Dr. Bataille, in the first volume of The Devil in\r\nthe Nineteenth Century, remarks, as a peculiarity of Diana Vaughan,\r\nthat she “is very fond of wearing male attire,” but no allusions of\r\nthis kind, however pointed, seemed to have excited any suspicion of\r\nguile in minds predisposed to credulity by Nature and by education.\r\n\r\nTaxil’s long series of mystifications, extending over a dozen years,\r\nculminated in the convocation of an antimasonic congress at Trent, on\r\nSeptember 26, 1896, to the president of which Leo XIII addressed an\r\napostolical brief with his benediction, and expressed the hope that\r\nthe assembled representatives of the Church would not rest until the\r\n“detestable sect” had been unmasked and the evil utterly eradicated.\r\nA “central executive committee,” consisting of a score of Italian\r\npapists, issued a circular summoning all Catholics to join “the new\r\ncrusade,” and declaring that the Vatican had now raised a war-cry\r\nagainst Freemasonry, “the den of Satan,” as it did eight centuries\r\nago against Islam. Taxil was received with ovations, and did not\r\nhesitate to poke fun at the venerable prelates to their very faces.\r\nWith an assumption of modesty he reproved them for what might be\r\nmisplaced enthusiasm. “One can never be sure,” he said, “of a converted\r\nFreemason, but must always fear lest he may return to his former\r\nfriends. Not until the convert is dead can one be wholly free from\r\nthis anxiety. I am well aware that this general principle applies\r\nalso to myself.” But even this daring dash of irony, hardly hidden\r\nunder the gauzy disguise of self-distrust, did not cool the ardor\r\nof his admirers, who continued to greet the harlequin with “_Evviva\r\nTaxil_!” His photograph hung among the pictures of the saints, and\r\nthe mere mention of his name called forth loud applause, whereupon\r\nthe prince of mountebanks rose and bowed. A few Germans had the good\r\nsense and courage to protest against these demonstrations, and to\r\ndoubt the existence of Diana Vaughan and the sincerity of Taxil,\r\nwhose sole object, as Dr. Gratzfeld asserted, was to “lay a snare for\r\nCatholics and anti-Freemasons, and scoff at them when they are caught\r\nin it.” This skepticism created intense excitement, and was severely\r\nrebuked by an Italian priest and a Parisian prebendary, who averred\r\nthat they knew Diana Vaughan personally, and could vouch for her\r\nsaintliness. A French monk used such violent language in his reply to\r\nDr. Gratzfeld that the presiding officer, although indorsing his views,\r\nfelt constrained to call him to order. “Any doubt of Diana Vaughan’s\r\nexistence or of the genuineness of her revelations,” exclaimed the Abbé\r\nde Bessonies, “is a sin against the antimasonic cause!” The Spanish\r\ndelegates introduced a resolution demanding that all Freemasons should\r\nbe legally incapacitated to hold any civil office or military command;\r\nthe resolution was adopted, with the amendment that “wherever it may be\r\nfeasible” such laws should be enacted and executed. The manner in which\r\nTaxil met the allegations of his opponents is highly characteristic.\r\n“A priest of the Holy Sacrament, Father Delaporte, had often declared\r\nthat he would gladly give his life for the conversion of Diana Vaughan.\r\nShe attended mass in the cloister for the first time on Corpus Christi,\r\nand left her sacred retreat on the following Saturday. On the very day\r\nof her departure Father Delaporte died. And yet there are persons who\r\ndoubt the existence of Miss Vaughan!” The burst of applause elicited\r\nby this irrefragable argument proved his accurate appreciation of\r\nthe logical powers of his auditors, whose minds had been fed on the\r\nnutriment which may be wholesome as “milk for babes,” but, when\r\npersistently administered to adults, converts them into intellectual\r\nmilksops.\r\n\r\nAlthough the congress was attended by many of the chief dignitaries\r\nof the papal hierarchy, and the Romish Patriarch of Constantinople\r\nsat there in state with a golden crown on his head, Taxil was its\r\nruling spirit. On his motion, it was resolved to establish antimasonic\r\nassociations in every land under the auspices of the bishops and the\r\ndirection of national committees, and a commission was appointed to\r\ninvestigate the Diana Vaughan affair. A few months later, on January\r\n22, 1897, this commission made an indecisive and utterly nugatory\r\nreport, to the effect that “no thoroughly convincing evidence had been\r\nfurnished for or against the existence and conversion of Diana Vaughan\r\nand the authenticity of the writings attributed to her.” This evasion\r\nof the issue, however, did not shake the confidence of the ultramontane\r\npress, nor prevent its positive affirmation of the points which the\r\ncommission had discreetly left in doubt. As a reward for this fanatical\r\nzeal and steadfast credulity, the editor of The Pelican received a\r\nspecial apostolical benediction, and was thus encouraged to “resist the\r\nraging of Satan.” “Stand firm!” he exclaimed. “The Holy Father is with\r\nus, and who is over him?”\r\n\r\nWith the Congress of Trent the mystification which Taxil had been\r\nplaying off on papacy for so many years had reached the acme of\r\nsuccess, and nothing now remained but to wind up the plot with a\r\ndrastic _denouement_. Accordingly, Diana Vaughan issued an invitation\r\nto a conference to be held on April 19, 1897, in the great hall of\r\nthe Geographical Society of Paris. It was also stated that other\r\nconferences would be held in the principal cities of France, Italy,\r\nEngland, and the United States. The programme for the evening was quite\r\nelaborate, beginning with a lottery for an American typewriter and\r\nending with a series of fifty-four stereopticon pictures representing,\r\namong other fantastic scenes, Sophia Walder and her serpents, events in\r\nthe life of Diana Vaughan, the apparition of the devil Bitru in Rome,\r\nEden and Eve with the fatal apple, sacrilegious stabbing of the host\r\non a Satanic altar in a Masonic lodge at Berlin, and finally Leo XIII\r\nwith the encyclical letter _Humanum genus_ as a flaming sword in his\r\nhand, the archangel Michael on his right and the apocalyptic St. John\r\non his left treading the triple-headed dragon of Freemasonry under\r\nfoot. The audience consisted chiefly of priests, with a few Protestant\r\nclergymen and Freemasons, and an unusually large number of newspaper\r\nreporters. The typewriter was won by Ali Kemal, correspondent of the\r\nConstantinople journal _Ikdam_, who only regretted that it did not\r\nwrite Turkish. Taxil then appeared on the platform, and began his\r\naddress with the words: “Reverend sirs, ladies, and gentlemen! You\r\nwish to see Diana Vaughan. Look at me! I myself am that lady!” After\r\nthis startling exordium, he proceeded to relate how from his youth\r\nup he had always had an irresistible inclination to play practical\r\njokes. Once he frightened the inhabitants of Marseilles by discovering\r\na shoal of sharks in the harbor, and again he set the archæologists\r\nall agog by announcing the existence of a city, built on piles, at the\r\nbottom of Lake Leman. But these were “childish things” compared with\r\nthe manner in which he had humbugged the Catholic clergy for nearly a\r\ndozen years. We need not report the details of his discourse; it is\r\nsufficient to say that he gave a full account of the deep-laid plot\r\nfrom its first conception to its final consummation at the Congress of\r\nTrent. Each new disclosure called forth cries of “Liar!” “Scoundrel!”\r\n“Vilifier!” “Villain!” and similar epithets, but nothing could disturb\r\nthe cynical composure of the speaker. As a precautionary measure, all\r\npersons had been required to give up their canes and umbrellas at the\r\nentrance, otherwise the angry words would have been emphasized by\r\nblows. The shameless impostor coolly referred to the numerous presents\r\nreceived, among which was an Emmenthaler cheese, sent by the Marquis\r\nde Morès, with pious sayings carved in the rind. “It was an excellent\r\ncheese,” he added, “and served to strengthen me in my fight against\r\nFreemasonry.” The money remitted to Diana Vaughan in ten years amounted\r\nto more than half a million francs, and flowed into the pockets of\r\nTaxil and his confederates. He expressed his thanks to the clergy for\r\ntheir aid in carrying out his scheme, and attributed their co-operation\r\nchiefly to ignorance and imbecility, but partly also to dishonesty,\r\ndeclaring that among the many dupes there were not a few knaves. As\r\nhe left the hall he was threatened with violence, and took refuge\r\nin a neighboring _café_, under the protection of the police. No one\r\nthought any longer of the pictures which were to form such a novel and\r\nattractive feature of the entertainment; indeed, this forgetfulness\r\nconstituted an important although unprinted part of the programme in\r\nthe minds of those who arranged it.\r\n\r\nHow difficult it is for constitutionally credulous persons, in whom\r\nthis disposition has been nurtured by education, to take a rational\r\nview of things when a strong appeal is made to their prejudices, is\r\nevident from a statement published in the _Osservatore Cattolico_ of\r\nMilan, in May, 1897, that Leo Taxil was held in durance vile by the\r\nFreemasons, one of whom personated him on the occasion just described.\r\nAnother Catholic writer asserted that Diana Vaughan did not appear at\r\nthe conference because Taxil had been bribed by the Freemasons to have\r\nher shut up in a lunatic asylum.\r\n\r\nThe history of Taxil’s imposture has been circumstantially narrated\r\nin a book entitled _Leo XIII und der Satanskult_, by Dr. J. Ricks\r\n(Berlin: Hermann Walther, 1897, pp. xiv-301; price, three marks).\r\nThe author, a doctor of divinity and pastor of a Lutheran church at\r\nOlvenstadt, near Magdeburg, has collected his materials from authentic\r\nsources and treated the whole subject with remarkable thoroughness and\r\nimpartiality. His work is a valuable contribution to the voluminous\r\nannals of religious superstition and credulity.\r\n\r\nThe ease with which Taxil succeeded in duping so many prominent\r\nrepresentatives of the papal hierarchy naturally disturbed the\r\nequanimity of the most intelligent Catholics, especially in Germany,\r\nand caused them to sound a note of alarm. How is it possible, they\r\nasked themselves, for a large body of educated men, claiming to be\r\nthe spiritual guides of the people, to become the victims of so plump\r\nan imposition? Is it not due to radical defects in the development\r\nand discipline of the intellectual faculties? Nearly a century ago\r\nMadame de Staël remarked that “since the Reformation the Protestant\r\nuniversities stand unquestionably higher than the Catholic, and the\r\nwhole literary fame of Germany emanates from these institutions”;\r\nand this opinion has been quoted and indorsed by the unimpeachable\r\nauthority of an eminent Catholic theologian, the late Professor\r\nDöllinger.[J] Recently another Catholic, Dr. Hermann Schell, Professor\r\nof Apologetics in the University of Würzburg, has called attention to\r\nthe latest statistics of religious denominations in Germany, showing\r\nthe inferiority of Catholics, as indicated by their comparative lack\r\nof interest in higher education and the smaller percentage of them in\r\nthe learned professions.[K] In this connection he refers to Taxil’s\r\nsuccessful exposure of the intellectual deficiencies, which render\r\nthe hierophants of Roman Catholicism incapable of resisting the most\r\npalpable delusions of superstition. His two “tracts for the times,”\r\nas they might fitly be termed, _Der Katholicismus als Princip des\r\nFortschritts_ and _Die neue Zeit und der alte Glaube_, maintain that\r\nCatholicism should be progressive, and that the old faith can remain\r\na living force in each new era only by adapting itself to every real\r\nadvance of mankind in knowledge and thus becoming reanimated by the\r\nspirit of the age. Professor Schell expresses his sympathy with the\r\nmovement in favor of greater freedom of thought and independence of\r\nresearch, known as “Americanism” in the Catholic Church, and regards\r\nits extension to the Old World as a vital necessity.[L]\r\n\r\n    [J] _Cf._ Ignaz von Döllinger.

A noteworthy feature is the large\r\n        proportion of Jews, and curiously enough this laudable\r\n        characteristic is made by anti-Semitic agitators a ground\r\n        of crimination and used to prejudice the public mind. Not\r\n        long since a demagogue of that ilk in Berlin charged the\r\n        Jews with putting forth every effort for the education\r\n        of their sons, in order that they might more effectually\r\n        compete with Christians; “therefore down with the Jews!”\r\n\r\n\r\n    [L] Since these lines were written Professor Schell has been\r\n        disciplined and threatened with excommunication by the\r\n        See of Rome. We regret to be obliged to add that he did\r\n        not have the courage to maintain his opinions, but made a\r\n        public recantation of them. The cause of progress in the\r\n        Catholic Church has now found a new and apparently more\r\n        fearless advocate in a Bavarian priest, Dr. Müller, of\r\n        Munich, whose pamphlet on Reformkatholizismus can hardly\r\n        escape the interdict of the papal hierarchy.\r\n\r\nIt is creditable to the Catholic prelates in the United States that\r\nthey were not among the foolish birds caught with the lime laid by Leo\r\nTaxil. Indeed, the Bishop of Charleston went to Rome for the express\r\npurpose of warning Leo XIII against this trickster, but was sharply\r\nreprehended and admonished to be silent. A similar rebuke was given to\r\nthe Apostolic Vicar of Gibraltar for denying the existence there of\r\nTubal-Cain’s subterranean laboratory for manufacturing microbes.\r\n\r\nThe _Breviarium Romanum_, the daily use of which, as a manual of\r\ndevotion and edification, is enjoined by the Pope on the clergy, is\r\nfull of legends which are recorded as historical facts, and quite equal\r\nin absurdity to Taxil’s most extravagant and fantastic inventions. The\r\ntales there told of the miracles wrought by saints, their communion\r\nwith angels, and their combats with devils may have easily suggested\r\nmany incidents narrated in The Devil in the Nineteenth Century and\r\nthe Memoirs of Diana Vaughan. It is no wonder that minds accustomed\r\nto accept the marvels of hagiology as actual events should be readily\r\ndeceived by a clever caricature of them, especially when appealing to a\r\nprejudice so absurd and yet so strong as that entertained by the papacy\r\nagainst Freemasonry. It would seem from many indications that the\r\nRomish Church, as an ecclesiastical organization, bears about the same\r\nrelation to contemporary culture that Roman paganism did to the best\r\nthought of the period when Lucian wrote his sprightly dialogues and\r\nLucretius his genial and comprehensive didactic poem _De Rerum Natura_.\r\nIs it doomed to the same fate, or has it, as Professor Schell and Dr.\r\nMüller assert, a saving, recuperative power?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Of the geological age of the building stones used in the United\r\n    States, George P. Merrill observes, in his report to the Maryland\r\n    Geological Survey, that few stones are used to any extent that are\r\n    of later date than the Triassic, and few, if any, of our marbles\r\n    are younger than the Silurian, while nearly all our granites, as\r\n    now quarried, belong at least to Palæozoic or Archæan times. Stones\r\n    of later age than Triassic are, so far as relates to the eastern\r\n    United States, so friable or so poor in color as to have little\r\n    value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUINE STARCH FACTORIES.\r\n\r\nBY BYRON D. HALSTED, SC. D.,\r\n\r\nRUTGERS COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch in this world is neither upon first nor last analysis true to\r\nname. From the corner grocery we buy a pound of starch in a rectangular\r\npackage highly decorated with lithograph and lettering, setting\r\nforth the excellences of the product, “superior to all others,” and\r\nmanufactured, with the utmost care, by Messrs. So-and-So. The fact is\r\nthat the big seven-story establishment did not make a grain of the\r\nstarch, and the best that can be claimed is a satisfactory method\r\nof bringing the product already formed into the present acceptable\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nBut it is not the purpose of this paper to decry the refineries,\r\nwhether they be of starch, sugar, or this or that of a hundred natural\r\nproducts, but to direct attention to the source of that very common\r\nand, it may be safely said, indispensable substance known to the\r\nEnglish-speaking people as starch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--STARCH GRANULES OF THE POTATO.]\r\n\r\nIt will be no new surprise to state, by way of introduction to the\r\nsubject, that starch is the ordinary everyday product of ordinary\r\neveryday plants. So humble a vegetable as the potato has gained its way\r\ninto all lands of the more civilized peoples almost solely because it\r\nhas a habit of storing away, in large underground stems, a vast amount\r\nof starch. Let this provident tendency disappear in this plant for a\r\nsingle season, and the crop growers would discard it from their list of\r\nremunerative plants, while millions of people would turn with dismay to\r\nsome other source of a daily supply of starch. What this change in the\r\nnature of a single kind of plant would mean to the human race words can\r\nnot describe. If the famine in Ireland of 1845 and some later years,\r\ninduced by a rot in the potato, is any index, the misery would be\r\nsomething worse than we should care to even dream of. When there is a\r\nshortage of starch in India, a distress follows that is felt through\r\nthe bonds of sympathy, if in no other way, the whole world round. Let\r\nrice fail to mature its grain, which means, in short, not to store its\r\nstarch in available form for man, and the dependent race is brought\r\nto the ghostly condition of starvation and thrown upon the charity\r\nof those people whose starch is in their grain elevators, sacks, and\r\nbarrels almost without number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--STARCH GRANULES OF CORN.]\r\n\r\nStarch, it would seem from this, is the prime food element of the\r\nhuman family, the chief factor in the upbuilding of a race, because a\r\nfundamental aliment of our bodies.\r\n\r\nIf the starch factories do not make, in the true sense, the product of\r\ntheir mills, it may be to the point to consider how this all-important\r\nsubstance comes into existence. The organic chemist tells us that\r\nstarch is a ternary compound, and this agrees closely with the\r\ndefinition laid down by the dictionaries, only they add that it is\r\nodorless, tasteless, and insoluble in water. It is one of the proximate\r\nprinciples of plants, and is stored in the form of granules wonderfully\r\nvariable in size and shape, but each kind having a type that is adhered\r\nto with much regularity. For example, the ordinary potato (_Solanum\r\ntuberosum_ L.) produces a starch granule that is characterized by\r\na form resembling the shell of the oyster. Fig. 1 is from a camera\r\ndrawing of a cell from the center of a potato, with portions of\r\nadjoining cells, all of which were packed full of starch, a few grains\r\nonly being represented.\r\n\r\nStarch is acted upon differently by reagents, one of the leading tests\r\nfor it being a solution of iodine. A drop of a very weak solution will\r\ndetermine the presence of starch in a cuff or shirt front by leaving\r\na blue spot or streak where the iodine has been applied. By means of\r\nthis reagent the student of plant tissues is readily able to locate\r\nstarch when present in any slice of tissue he may have made. He would,\r\nfor example, find much more starch in the tuber of the potato than in\r\nany other portion of the plant, and there the grains will be found many\r\ntimes larger than in the stem or the cells of the green leaves. Of the\r\nrelation of the starch in the leaves to that in the underground stem\r\nsomething may be said later in this paper.\r\n\r\nIn the corn plant the starch is stored chiefly in the grain, and not in\r\nthe subterranean portions, as in the potato. The granules of the corn\r\nstarch are much smaller than those of the potato, as indicated by Fig.\r\n2, which is from a camera drawing of a cell from a grain of corn and\r\nmade to the same scale as Fig. 1. The granules are oval and not much\r\nmarked with striæ or lines, but chemically the substance is the same in\r\nboth cases.\r\n\r\nAnother leading starch is that of wheat, the form of the grains of\r\nwhich is shown in Fig. 3. While somewhat larger than the corn-starch\r\ngranules, they are not otherwise widely different.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--STARCH GRANULES OF WHEAT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--STARCH GRANULES OF RICE.]\r\n\r\nOne could scarcely overlook the starch produced by the rice plant, for\r\nit feeds more people than the potato, corn, or wheat. The relative size\r\nand form of the rice-starch granules are shown in Fig. 4. It is seen\r\nthat the grains are not large, and with a strong tendency to break up\r\ninto small angular pieces.\r\n\r\nThere are almost as many forms of starch as plants producing it,\r\nsome of them being very odd in shape. Thus the tapioca starch has a\r\ncharacteristic form, as also the sago; but it is not the purpose here\r\nto more than call attention to the form in which the substance under\r\nconsideration is laid down in plants. The student of food adulterations\r\nis an expert in the detection of starches, and, with his microscope and\r\nskill, is able to decide how much of one kind of starch and how much of\r\nanother is offered in the product under examination. It is a matter of\r\ncongratulation that Nature has set herself so strongly against fraud\r\nin food stuffs as to record the origin of each grain of starch in the\r\ngrain itself.\r\n\r\nAnd that brings us to a consideration of that origin. We must accord\r\nto plants the exalted prerogative of being the exclusive and universal\r\nstarch-formers in the world. Whether we note the growth of the potato\r\ntubers or the plumping out of the grains of corn, wheat, or rice, the\r\nsame fact remains that storehouses are being filled with the same\r\norganic compound. There must be many preliminary steps before this\r\nprocess of storing is complete, and for these we need to seek elsewhere\r\nin the growing plant.\r\n\r\nEven the most careless observer can not but be at home with the fact\r\nthat the whole port and bearing of ordinary plants is for sun exposure.\r\nThey rise from the ground as closely placed stems of grass or less\r\nneighborly orchard or forest trees, and hang out their leaves to catch\r\nthe sun. The economy of substance is so well studied that there is a\r\nvery large exposure at a minimum of expenditure of tissue. In short,\r\nthe leaves are the organs for association with the sunlight. They\r\nreach toward the sun where light is scanty, as in the window, and even\r\nturn their faces to the orb of day, shifting the position hour by hour\r\nfrom sunrise to nightfall. The rapidity with which we come to the\r\nfundamental fact that leaves are for the sun almost surprises one. The\r\npurpose is as easily inferred, but the steps in the process are not so\r\nquickly taken. The facts that leaves are _par excellence_ the starch\r\nfactories and the sunlight the inobtrusive chemist are granted, and it\r\nremains only to show something of the steps of proof that science may\r\nhave discovered.\r\n\r\nWe need, therefore, to consider starch from the standpoint of its\r\ncomposition, and upon this the chemists are fairly well agreed. It\r\nconsists of three elements, with their atoms so arranged that the\r\nmolecule of starch has the composition of six parts of carbon, ten\r\nof hydrogen, and five of oxygen, or, to express the formula in terse\r\nchemical terms, it stands C₆H₁₀O₅. If we can account for the bringing\r\nof these atoms together in the production of a single molecule of\r\nstarch the laboratory has been explored and the secret is ours, even if\r\nwe can not put it to practical use in our so-called “starch factories.”\r\n\r\nThe independent plant, beyond serious question, gets its food from\r\noutside itself. There are two sources for these substances--namely, the\r\nsoil-water bathing the absorbing roots, and the atmosphere, with which\r\nthe aërial branches and their leaves are constantly surrounded. From\r\nthe soil come the water and all the salts, ash constituents, and the\r\nlike that may be dissolved therein, while the gases of the atmosphere\r\nbring, among its chief contributions, a constant and, in an always\r\nexceedingly diluted form, the carbon dioxide, or, sometimes called,\r\nthe carbonic-acid gas. This compound, familiar to us as a product of\r\ncombustion, fermentation, and decay, is composed of carbon and oxygen,\r\nand has the symbol CO₂ associated with it by chemists.\r\n\r\nIn short, for the formation of our starch the water (H₂O) from the\r\nsoil and the CO₂ of the atmosphere, when brought together, may be made\r\nto combine with the formation of starch. A single diagram, while not\r\nperhaps an absolute statement of fact, may serve to represent the final\r\nresult:\r\n\r\n  {6CO₂\r\n  {     = C₆H₁₀O₅ + 12O.\r\n  {5H₂O\r\n\r\nIn other words, the six molecules of carbon dioxide and five of water\r\ncombine with the formation of one molecule of starch and the liberation\r\nof twelve atoms of oxygen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--DIAGRAMMATIC VIEW OF THE PROCESS OF\r\nPHOTO-SYNTHESIS.]\r\n\r\nThis driving off of such a large amount of oxygen, entirely against the\r\nwhole tendency of that element, it is assumed, is at the expenditure\r\nof much force. The only one adequate to this work is solar energy, and\r\nthis is abundantly at hand. That we need not seek further for this\r\npower is proved by many and conclusive tests. Vegetable physiologists\r\nto-day are able not only to locate the sun as the chemist, that\r\neffects the changes necessary for the production of starch, but can\r\nshow in what cells and portions of those cells the forces effect\r\nthe synthesis. The chlorophyll granules in the living cell are the\r\nmicroscopic laboratories in which a silent chemist, powerful beyond all\r\nmeasurements, builds out of inorganic materials the food substance of\r\nthe whole world of animals and plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--PORTION OF LEAF MAGNIFIED, ILLUSTRATING\r\nPHOTO-SYNTHESIS.]\r\n\r\nFig. 5 is an attempt to present the above statements as to\r\nphoto-synthesis in plants in such a form that it may appeal to the eye\r\nof the reader. A bit of maple twig is shown with one leaf in position.\r\nPassing up the stem in the young wood is the crude sap from the soil\r\nto the leaf. There is a downward flow of elaborated sap in the inner\r\nbark also represented. Solar energy is indicated by the wave lines as\r\nplaying upon the upper side of the leaf, while the direction of the\r\ncarbon dioxide is shown by the dotted lines entering from both above\r\nand below the leaf. Water of transportation is indicated as being\r\ngiven off, and upon a dry, hot day this is considerable, which, as it\r\nvaporizes in the tissue, tends to keep the latter cool. Lastly, with\r\nthe formation of starch there is the escape of oxygen set free from the\r\nbroken molecule of carbon dioxide or water or both in the formation of\r\nthe starch.\r\n\r\nFig. 6 is a similar attempt to show the process of starch formation\r\nwith the use of a portion of the leaf in section as it might appear\r\nunder the microscope. The under portion of the leaf is seen as having\r\nopenings in the skin, through which the gases and vapors pass, and the\r\nmiddle portion above shows the porous nature of that part that is most\r\nactive in synthesis. The small oval bodies in all the cells, except\r\nthose of the upper and under epidermis, represent the chlorophyll\r\ngranules, the special seat of the special activities which result in\r\nthe formation of the carbohydrate, familiar to all as starch. To the\r\nright is a leaf vein, through which the crude sap (_c. s._) reaches the\r\nsynthetic cells, and the elaborated sap (_e. s._) descends to places\r\nwhere it is needed for growth or for storage.\r\n\r\nWith the above facts in mind, there is no wonder at the activity that\r\nmay reside in a field of corn during a bright day in August. Starch is\r\nbeing made almost by the ton daily, and, if the conditions favor, the\r\nnext month will find a rich harvest for the husbandman who has assisted\r\nin supplying the conditions for the desired output of the leading\r\ncarbohydrate.\r\n\r\nThe genuine starch factories of the world are exceedingly small and\r\nequally numerous, and, with the sunlight as the active force, each\r\ngreen cell may contribute to the world’s gain in the food substances\r\nthat enable all creatures to live and move and enjoy a fairly\r\ncomfortable existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRADE CORPORATIONS IN CHINA.\r\n\r\nBY M. MAURICE COURANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remarkable longevity of a large number of business houses in China\r\nis not due solely to the general conditions of society or to those\r\nwhich are peculiar to the commercial class, but their stability and\r\ntheir fame rest upon a special organization, under which they are\r\nunited in groups. It is customary for all the houses possessing the\r\nsame specialty to form an association which I shall call a corporation,\r\nreserving to myself the privilege of pointing out a few exceptions to\r\nthe rule. These corporations, which seem to date from at least three\r\ncenturies back, are difficult subjects to study. Various in type,\r\nformed by the individuals interested, without the state having had\r\nanything to do with their regulations or even perhaps authorized them,\r\nthey exist by force of custom and live conformably to their traditions,\r\nwhile some, I have been told, have written regulations and even,\r\nperhaps, archives--which they have not thought fit to communicate to\r\nthe public. What is to be learned of them has, therefore, to be deduced\r\nfrom their visible transactions.\r\n\r\nThe corporation fixes the minimum price of articles of sale, and has\r\nsecret agents to watch that no house takes less, thereby setting bounds\r\nto competition and preventing the injurious depreciation of goods.\r\nOnly the public suffers from the existence of the minimum, but it does\r\nnot seem to perceive it, and the Government never interferes except in\r\nrespect to the price of grain, for which it fixes a maximum, and in\r\ntimes of great stress sells from its own granaries. The corporation,\r\ntoo, as represented in the banks and loan offices, fixes the rates of\r\ninterest to be paid or received, and the kinds of securities and moneys\r\nthat shall be accepted. In short, it adjusts the general regulations\r\nof business transactions, and defends the common interests of all\r\nthose associated in it. If one of them is implicated in a judicial\r\nproceeding of general interest the corporation sustains him with\r\nits credit and its funds. It further takes in hand injuries to the\r\ninterests of its associates. In 1883 the tea merchants’ corporation of\r\nHankow suspecting frauds by the agents of certain foreign houses, asked\r\nthose houses to designate themselves some foreigner to superintend\r\nthe weighings. Notwithstanding the good reputation of the corporation\r\nand the moderation of its requests, the foreign houses refused. All\r\ntransactions were suspended, and the official in authority declared\r\nthat he could not compel the merchants to sell contrary to their wish,\r\nand the foreign houses were eventually obliged to yield, one at a time.\r\n\r\nThe corporations likewise watch the transactions of their members,\r\noppose fraud which might harm the good name of the association so far\r\nthat the silversmiths will not permit one of their number to sell\r\nalloyed jewelry, even when the purchaser knows it is such. Some see\r\nthat the taxes and duties on production are regularly and properly\r\npaid. Others, in the interest of the stability of the houses, forbid\r\nall fictitious sales and purchases, and most of the stock operations\r\nand a large number of commercial transactions which seem very\r\nsimple to us would not be tolerated by them. The custom of selling\r\nshort having been introduced upon the silver exchange in Peking a\r\nfew years ago, a censor reported it as a kind of gambling, and the\r\nGovernment interdicted the operation--a very rare example of official\r\nintervention. Under a similar old-fashioned view, the corporation of\r\nbankers inquires into the total amount of the notes issued by its\r\nmembers. Every banker and every broker is free to issue notes, and\r\nlittle attention is paid to the precautions required by the law. But\r\nthe corporation has an infallible means of restricting extravagance in\r\nthe emission of bills. If a house is going so fast as to be in danger\r\nof compromising its credit and perhaps endangering the capital of\r\nothers associated with it, an order is given, all the notes are thrown\r\nbefore the public, and the imprudent bank has to suspend its payments\r\nand retire.\r\n\r\nThe corporation further maintains its reputation and keeps on good\r\nterms with public powers by expenditures on ceremonials and charities.\r\nEvery year it appropriates a sum for the opening of the kitchens from\r\nwhich rice and millet broths are distributed to the poor of Peking.\r\nIn case of famine or inundation, the quotas of the corporations do\r\nnot have to be waited for, while the more prominent commercial men\r\nalso contribute largely under their own names. They will subscribe\r\nfor a testimonial to a mandarin who has done good service, will help\r\nprepare the road over which an imperial procession is to pass, and will\r\ncontribute to the pageantry of popular religious ceremonials.\r\n\r\nEach corporation has its patron divinity, who is the object of a\r\nspecial cult. With one it is the god of riches; with another Koan Yu,\r\ngod of war; with others a spirit of more limited competency, like\r\nLou Pan, a famous mechanician of the time of Confucius, now patron of\r\nthe carpenters. Adored in every shop by all the patrons and clerks,\r\nthe festivals of the protecting genius are celebrated by the whole\r\ncorporation at fixed dates. To some divinities a sacrifice of meats and\r\nincense is offered in each warehouse, after which all the chiefs and\r\nthe men employed take part, while the spirit is supposed to be present.\r\nTo others, more rarely, a more bountiful sacrifice is made in a temple,\r\nand the banquet, held in a large hall, is enlivened by dramatic\r\nentertainments. The patron is also duly honored in the celebration of\r\nthe general feasts of the Chinese people.\r\n\r\nThe corporations have tribunals of arbitration and a common treasury,\r\nbut the method of operation of those departments is among the things\r\nthey do not reveal to the public. I have only learned a few general\r\nfacts on the subject. The corporations intervene, I have been told,\r\nin the disputes of the members and to prevent dishonest dealings and\r\nattempts to cheat one another, but I have not learned that they have\r\nany real judiciary authority. Their treasury is sustained by means of\r\nassessments and fines, and loans may be contracted on its account, for\r\nthe salt merchants of Tientsin are still paying interest on a number of\r\ndebts contracted by the corporation in the last century.\r\n\r\nGreat differences might be expected to exist between the corporations\r\nin respect to these points and many others. They have been constituted\r\nat different epochs, independently of one another, and are similar only\r\nin their essential features. The minimum price fixed by the assembly\r\nis not equally imperative in all. Thus, the price fixed by the fur\r\nmerchants at the beginning of the winter does not bind the members.\r\nIn most branches of commerce all the houses composing the corporation\r\nare on a footing of substantial equality, though, of course, the large\r\nbanks prevail over the small brokers, but there is no unlikeness in\r\nthe business or the situation. The policy of the tea trade is mainly\r\ncontrolled in Peking by the houses of the families Fang and Oou. They\r\nfix the price, determine the equivalence of weight (the standard is a\r\npound of four ounces instead of sixteen), and lead the corporation.\r\nIn fact, the retail dealers use their capital in the decoration of\r\ntheir shops with gilding and sculpture, at a cost of between sixteen\r\nhundred and two thousand dollars, while the goods are lent them by\r\none of the importers, who holds the decoration as security, so that\r\nthe whole corporation is in the hands of these two families. This is\r\na special condition, and there is nothing else like it, even among\r\nother importers of southern products. While most branches of trade\r\nare independent of official action, slaughter houses, of which there\r\nare only five in Peking, have to be authorized by the Government.\r\nA religious motive may be at the bottom of this restriction, the\r\nlarge cattle being reserved for the imperial sacrifices. Moreover,\r\nthe killing of animals has been interdicted at different times, and\r\neven now the slaughter houses are ordered closed, as an act of public\r\npenitence, in times of drought.\r\n\r\nThe loan houses also need an official authorization. They pay a tax\r\non their operations to the local authorities, and are divided into\r\nthree classes, according to the importance of their business. Those\r\nof the first class receive deposits from the authorities of various\r\nsums, on which they pay interest, the administration reasoning that\r\nby helping them increase their capital and enlarge their business it\r\nwill be doing a philanthropic work and assisting the people. These loan\r\noffices are not at all like our pawnbrokers’ shops, but are a credit\r\ninstitution, to which the middle class as well as the poor Chinaman has\r\nconstant recourse. Being conducted on equitable terms and serving their\r\nconvenience in various ways, they render great services to the Chinese\r\npeople, and have become necessary to their life, and this explains the\r\ndeparture of the Government from its usual policy of non-interference\r\nto supervise and favor them. China has, further, large and small\r\ncapitalists, and numerous credit establishments very much like ours.\r\nThey may be classified as exchange offices, banks, and banks of\r\ndiscount. The last are at Peking, where they were founded a few decades\r\nago by some men from Chan-Si. Their single industry is trading notes in\r\nall China and some of its dependencies. They have no monopoly, for some\r\nof the larger banks and more important traders were all doing the same;\r\nbut they have regulated the business, extended it to more places, and\r\nhave almost entirely suppressed the transportation of money in bulk.\r\n\r\nThe banks of exchange perform a variety of functions on a restricted\r\nscale, charging two per cent for exchanges, issuing notes without any\r\nsupervision, and lending money at two per cent a month in normal times.\r\nThey are not, however, always able to pay their notes at sight, and\r\nit is well, therefore, not to keep them too long. In the provinces a\r\nbank usually accepts only its own notes. In Peking some well-known\r\nsignatures are accepted everywhere after examination by an expert, who\r\nplaces his seal on the note he declares good, charges a fee for each\r\nverification, and is responsible for his mistakes.\r\n\r\nThe large banks, by accepting or refusing the notes of any house or by\r\nthrowing money or _sapiques_ on the market, rule in the corporation\r\nand have the whole fate of the market in their hands. The four Hengs,\r\nby the amount of their reserve, the solidity of their credit, and\r\nthe number of their branches or correspondents, have no rivals in\r\nnorth China. All exchange operations are carried on in the money\r\nmarket, which is held every day in the south-eastern part of the\r\ncity, on the street, near the Tauist Temple, where all the houses in\r\nPeking are represented, and every one takes care to be so, lest he\r\nbe thought in default. When the rate is fixed the news is dispatched\r\nby couriers, pigeons, etc., to all whom it concerns. The couriers of\r\nthe corporation, who communicate with the brokers and bankers, are\r\nalso the confidential agents of the syndics, are acquainted with the\r\namounts of the emissions of each house, know whether a certain patron\r\nis really ill or only feigning, and by their reports decide who shall\r\nbe boycotted or declared insolvent. All this goes on in full liberty,\r\nwithout surveillance by the state, without any tax on the transactions,\r\nand without any other interference than the prohibition of fictitious\r\ndealings. The corn market is in the same way the almost exclusive\r\ndomain of the corn corporation, the state never interfering except in\r\nthe case of a famine in the region.\r\n\r\nBesides the merchants’ corporations, there exist also corporations of\r\nartisans. The embroiderers, the makers of _cloisonné_, the tanners,\r\nand the carpenters have theirs. The carriers and the boatmen, who,\r\nbefore the opening of the railway, had the monopoly of transportation\r\nbetween Peking and the provinces without forming associations, met\r\nat their respective inns and established rules and rates for their\r\nbusiness. Informal organizations, varying among the different towns in\r\ntheir degrees of development, exist among the barbers--who at Peking\r\nmeet every year for a sacrifice and a banquet--the chair-bearers,\r\nand the _jinrikisha_ men, and so every city has its corporations and\r\nassociations which are not like those of the next city.\r\n\r\nSome branches of trade have no corporations, and the peasants, when\r\nthey come to town to sell their produce, trade on their own account,\r\nfor the best terms they can get, and have to accept, in the market,\r\nan organization the origin of which is forgotten. Every year, on the\r\nappearance of each sort of crop, the _King ki_ of the market, having\r\nagreed with the dealers, fixes the minimum price of the commodity for\r\nthe season. He also polices the market. The function of _King ki_ is\r\nthe property of the person who exercises it, who has bought it from his\r\npredecessor and will sell it to his successor by private contract, and\r\nnobody contests his right. In the market for _azaroles_ the position\r\nis hereditary. The monopoly of the corporations is often complicated\r\nwith a provincial question. The Chinaman regards every man who was born\r\nin another district as a foreigner--still more if he is of another\r\nprovince. Those who are of the same local origin, on the other hand,\r\nstand by one another. Hence it has come to pass that some trades have\r\nbeen monopolized by the people of some one province. Most of the\r\nbankers were originally from Chan-Si; all the great merchants came\r\nfrom Anhoei. The people of Chan-tung have three special occupations in\r\nPeking. They have the exclusive privilege of killing pigs and retailing\r\nmeat. They are the only water carriers, each one having his well on\r\nthe public highway, his watering place for horses and mules, and his\r\ndistrict where he sells water without permitting the people to provide\r\nfor themselves elsewhere. Such privileges are consecrated by usage and\r\nzealously defended by their holders, and respect for them is enforced,\r\nwhen necessary, by the authorities. Associations are formed, also, even\r\namong the coolies who work on the docks.\r\n\r\nThese details show by how great a variety of forms all the corporations\r\nassure the same result--the organization of labor. We see also how they\r\nextend beyond commerce. The Chinaman is in fact a social being bound\r\nclosely to his fellows--of the family, province, trade, or class--by\r\nevery tie and in every sphere of life. He is never a man living by\r\nhimself and for himself, and is not accustomed to independence. Hence\r\nthe authority of the corporation, instead of seeming strange, is a\r\nnecessity to him. Consequently the corporation has the right, by\r\nuniversal consent, to exact obedience from its members, and to compel\r\nthose who would stay out to come into it.--_Translated for the Popular\r\nScience Monthly from the Revue des Deux Mondes._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    M. L. Azoulay suggests, in the _Revue Scientifique_, that the\r\n    invitation given to Señor Rámon y Cajal, the celebrated Spanish\r\n    neurologist, to visit the United States and attend the celebration\r\n    of the tenth anniversary of Clark University, furnishes a good\r\n    example for France to follow. “It causes grievous chagrin to\r\n    me to think,” he says, “that while Germany, England, Austria,\r\n    Switzerland, and the United States are regularly accustomed\r\n    to invite to their scientific ceremonials, of which there are\r\n    more than one every year, students of other countries who have\r\n    illustrated any branch of human knowledge, France, formerly so\r\n    hospitable, refuses these international appeals.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    At the recent meeting of the British Archæological Association,\r\n    at Buxton, Dr. Brushfield described the prehistoric circle of\r\n    Arbor Low as, upon evidence which he cited, the earliest neolithic\r\n    monument in Britain. There are thirty-two stones in the circle, all\r\n    now lying prostrate, but they must originally have been erect. The\r\n    dolmen in the center is now level with the ground. The mound and\r\n    ditch--the latter being inside, between the mound and the stone\r\n    circle--are in a very perfect condition, notwithstanding the lapse\r\n    of time. The work has two openings--on the northeast and southwest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEditor’s Table.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SCIENCE AND DOGMA._\r\n\r\nAfter many uncomfortable turnings in his narrow theological quarters,\r\nthe eminent biologist, Professor St. George Mivart, seems to have made\r\nup his mind that he may as well, before he dies, know what it is to\r\nenjoy the air of liberty. For many years he has been pining for this,\r\nand almost inviting the authorities of the Church to give him his\r\npassports. The Church was not anxious, however, to quarrel with a man\r\nof recognized ability and wide knowledge, and therefore writings which\r\nmight well have been expected to give serious umbrage were allowed to\r\npass unnoticed. The professor then made a most audacious raid upon\r\nthe venerable doctrine that there remains for the majority of mankind\r\na place of unutterable and eternal misery. He ventured to speak of\r\nThe Happiness in Hell, maintaining that, while the inhabitants of\r\nthat abode would always have a profound and harrowing sense of having\r\nmissed the supreme happiness of heaven, they would still be able to\r\noccupy themselves in a variety of ways which would give them a certain\r\namount of happiness, just as in this world a man may carry a profound\r\nsorrow in his heart and yet, under the stimulus of business or society\r\nor intellectual study, have his attention happily diverted for many\r\nhours every day. At this point the authorities drew the line. It is\r\nrelated of an old Scotch lady that, referring to the Universalists,\r\nshe said, “Those people say that all men will be saved at last, but\r\n_we_ hope for better things.” Whether this was the point of view of\r\nthe ecclesiastical powers or not, certain it is that they refused to\r\nsanction the notion of any happiness, of howsoever humble an order,\r\nin the abode of gloom, and gave a peremptory order to the professor\r\nto take it all back. Well, he took it back as a matter of submission\r\nto those whom he regarded as his lawful spiritual guides, but the\r\nsubmission did not give him rest. If ecclesiastical authority was\r\nentitled to respect on one side, science was urging even stronger\r\nclaims on the other. In August last, as we now learn, the professor\r\nwrote to the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation of the Index,\r\nexplaining how he wished his submission to be understood, and as he and\r\nthe prefect could not come to an agreement about it, he withdrew the\r\nsubmission altogether. Then he resolved to relieve his mind. It took\r\ntwo articles in two separate magazines to do it--one in the Fortnightly\r\nand one in the Nineteenth Century--but then it was done in a manner\r\nadmitting of no recall. No sooner had these articles appeared than\r\nCardinal Vaughan drew up an iron-clad declaration affirming the falsity\r\nof every position the writer had taken, and required him to sign it.\r\nToo late! The biologist and evolutionist in Professor Mivart had\r\nfinally triumphed over the theologian, and he met the cardinal’s demand\r\nwith a flat refusal. Thereupon his Eminence issued an order excluding\r\nthe recalcitrant _savant_ from the sacraments of the Church.\r\n\r\nMr. Mivart now knows where he is. He occupies the broad ground of\r\nscientific truth. He breathes the free air of intellectual and moral\r\nliberty. He still professes loyalty to the Church according to his\r\nown conception of it, but he will no longer bow down to an authority\r\nthat assumes to prescribe his opinions in matters which he is quite\r\ncapable of judging for himself. He has arrived at the conclusion that\r\neven as regards the interpretation of Scripture the Church is just as\r\nliable to err as the humble layman. He quotes most persistently the\r\ncase of Galileo, in which the Church, in the most formal and official\r\nmanner, declared that Scripture taught what for nearly a century now\r\nit has admitted Scripture does not teach. If the highest organs of\r\necclesiastical authority could make such a blunder in Galileo’s day,\r\nwhat blunders may they not commit in our day? But if the Church can err\r\negregiously in what is its own peculiar province--if anything is--how\r\ngreat is likely to be its inaptitude when it undertakes to deal with\r\nscientific questions!\r\n\r\n“God has taught us,” says Mr. Mivart, “through history, that it is\r\nnot to ecclesiastical congregations but to men of science that he\r\nhas committed the elucidation of scientific questions, whether such\r\nquestions are or are not treated of by Scripture, the Fathers, the\r\nChurch’s common teaching, or special congregations or tribunals of\r\necclesiastics actually summoned for the purpose. This also applies to\r\nall science--to Scripture criticism, to biology, and to all questions\r\nconcerning evolution, the antiquity of man, and the origin of either\r\nhis body or his soul or of both. For all ecclesiastics who know nothing\r\nof natural science it is an act necessarily as futile as impertinent to\r\nexpress any opinion on such subjects.”\r\n\r\nThe opposition of the rulers of the Church to the true theory of\r\nthe solar system in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries is\r\nparalleled, according to Mr. Mivart, by their opposition to the\r\ndoctrine of evolution to-day. He refers to the fact that two Catholic\r\nprofessors who had ventured to give a partial support to the doctrine\r\nin question--one of them Father Zahm, who contributed an article,\r\nas many of our readers will remember, to this magazine a couple of\r\nyears ago--had both been compelled to retract and disavow what they\r\nhad published on the subject. Professor Mivart draws a distinction,\r\nhowever, between the rulers of the Church and the Church. The latter\r\nhe idealizes--and we by no means dispute his right to do so--as a\r\nvast organization the office of which is to keep alive man’s sense\r\nof spiritual things, and to bear eternal testimony in favor of those\r\ntruths of the heart which do not admit, like intellectual truths, of\r\nlogical demonstration. Though cut off by authority from participation\r\nin the rites of the Church, he feels himself still one in sympathy with\r\nall who in the Church are aspiring to a higher life. We look upon his\r\ncase as a very instructive one, affording as it does clear evidence of\r\nthe absolute incompatibility between any authoritative system of dogma\r\nand the free pursuit of truth. It has taken Professor Mivart a long\r\ntime to arrive at his present standpoint, but it is well that he has\r\ngot there at last. His example, we believe, will encourage not a few\r\nto assert in like manner their right to think freely and to utter what\r\nthey think.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A MORE EXCELLENT WAY._\r\n\r\nWhen our article of last month, entitled A Commission in Difficulties,\r\nwas written we had not seen the paper by Mr. Theodore Dreiser, in\r\nHarper’s Magazine for February, describing the important educational\r\nwork which the Western railways are doing with a view to promoting the\r\nprosperity of the agricultural regions through which they pass. In\r\nour article we observed that “the more interference there is between\r\nparties who, in the last resort, are dependent upon one another’s good\r\nwill, the less likely they are to recognize their substantial identity\r\nof interest.” What Mr. Dreiser clearly shows is how great the community\r\nof interest is between the railroads on the one side and the farming\r\ncommunity on the other, and how fully that community of interest is\r\nrecognized by the railways at least. The freight agent of a given line\r\nis charged with the duty of developing to the utmost--in the interest,\r\nprimarily, of his road, it may readily be granted--the agricultural\r\nresources of the country through which it runs. He has his assistants,\r\nwho look after different branches of the work, such as crop-raising,\r\ncattle-grazing, dairying, poultry-raising, etc. “Through this\r\ndepartment,” the writer says, “the railroads are doing a remarkably\r\nbroad educational work, not only of inspecting the land, but of\r\neducating the farmers and merchants, and helping them to become wiser\r\nand more successful. They give lectures on soil nutrition and vegetable\r\ngrowing, explain conditions and trade shipments, teach poultry-raising\r\nand cattle-feeding, organize creameries for the manufacture of cheese\r\nand butter, and explain new business methods to merchants who are slow\r\nand ignorant in the matter of conducting their affairs.” An agent of\r\nthe railway will visit every town along the line a certain number of\r\ntimes every year to see what he can do to quicken trade. Finally, in\r\nthe great centers there are special agents who “look after incoming\r\nshipments, and work for the interests of the merchants and farmers by\r\nfinding a market for their products.” Examples are given showing how\r\nthe railways are able to impart, and do impart, information of the\r\nhighest value to the farmers, such as puts them in the way of getting\r\ngreatly improved returns from their land.\r\n\r\nOf course, the railways want business, but it is eminently satisfactory\r\nwhen one party who wants business uses his best efforts on behalf of\r\nanother in order that by making him prosperous he himself may prosper.\r\nWhen things get into this shape they are all right, as the phrase is.\r\nThe accepted definition of a perfect action is one which benefits\r\nall who are parties to it. Things are on a much better foundation\r\nwhen people are mutually benefiting one another, each primarily in\r\nhis own interest, than when it is all philanthropy on one side and\r\npassive acceptance of benefits on the other. Philanthropy is an\r\nuncertain thing, and its effects are uncertain. Its quality will take,\r\nin general, a good deal of training; but business, on an honest and\r\nreciprocally helpful basis, is good all through.\r\n\r\nIt is a happy circumstance that there are natural laws and forces at\r\nwork which tend to produce a healthful social equilibrium. The true\r\nstatesman is he who is on the watch to discern these forces and these\r\nlaws, resolved that if he can not aid their operation he shall at least\r\nthrow no obstacle in the way of their activity. The amount of harm\r\nthat is done by coming between people who would be certain to arrange\r\ntheir business relations satisfactorily, if they were only left to do\r\nit without interference, can hardly be estimated. Man is fundamentally\r\na social animal, and he wants, if he can possibly get it, the good\r\nopinion of his fellows. This is a principle which legislation too much\r\noverlooks, but it is one on which, as we believe, the future progress\r\nof society depends, and which, in spite of the blunders of legislators,\r\nwill more and more assert itself as the years go on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFragments of Science.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Religious Suicides.=--Suicides from religious fanaticism, which are\r\nstill prescribed by some sects, are compared, as having a common\r\norigin, with propitiatory or expiatory human sacrifices, by Herr Lasch,\r\nin an article of which we find a review in the _Rivista Italiana di\r\nSociologica_. Voluntary sacrifices, which abound in the history of\r\nancient peoples, had nearly always in view the removal of perils or the\r\ncessation of public calamities by appeasing the anger of the divinity\r\nthrough the offering of a human victim. Thus Macaria, the daughter of\r\nHercules, at Athens during the Peloponnesian war, and Codrus and the\r\nAthenian youth Cratinus voluntarily offered their lives to aid their\r\ncountry by the sacrifice. The consul Decius gave himself up to assure\r\nvictory to his legions, and Adrian’s favorite Antinous to save his\r\nimperial protector. Spontaneous offerings of human victims to appease\r\noffended divinities are mentioned in the traditions of the ancient\r\nGermans, and it was usually their chief or king who suffered for the\r\ngood of the people. Offerings of this sort are far from infrequent\r\namong barbarous and half-civilized peoples. Among some tribes in China\r\na man is sacrificed every year for the public welfare. Such voluntary\r\nrenunciations of life to acquire merit with the divinity, to gain\r\nfavors, to atone for sins, and fulfill vows are very common in India,\r\nparticularly where Brahmanism is most influential. Special methods were\r\npointed out in the Hindu laws for performing such sacrifices as would\r\nbe sinful for a Brahman, but not for a Sutra, who, before abandoning\r\nlife, should make gifts to the Brahmans. A favorite method was to\r\ndrown one’s self in the Ganges, and particular spots in the river\r\nwere designated for this act. The sacred books mention five methods\r\nof performing sacrifice to assure a better fortune in the next life:\r\nStarving to death, being burned alive, burial in snow, being eaten by a\r\ncrocodile, and cutting the throat or being drowned at a particular spot\r\nin the Ganges. In fulfillment of vows, sons would sacrifice themselves\r\nfor their mothers by jumping from a rock. To keep up the courage of\r\nthe victim, the Sivaitic rituals promised many beatitudes to him who\r\ncourageously met death for his sins, and threatened eternal punishment\r\nto one who performed the sacrifice in a base manner. And when the\r\nsuicide had been decided upon they allowed no retreat or repentance,\r\nbut forced its consummation. A special apparatus for suicide formerly\r\nexisted in some of the villages in central India, consisting of a\r\nguillotine which the victim himself set in action. Casting one’s\r\nself under the wheels of the car of Juggernaut was another method of\r\nreligious suicide. Some philosophical schools prescribed subjection of\r\nthe body to various pains for the purification of the soul; and the\r\nbooks of Manu, which also impose the destruction of human sensibility,\r\nhave contributed much to preserve this idea in India and spread abroad,\r\nespecially in the Malay Archipelago, the usage of voluntary sacrifice\r\nto the divinity. The aborigines of the Canary Islands have employed\r\nvoluntary sacrifices on the coming of an epidemic, and the ancient\r\nMexicans and Peruvians observed them in honor of the divinity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=“Manuring with Brains.”=--“New Soil Science” is the name Mr. D.\r\nYoung gives, in the Nineteenth Century, to the results of the studies\r\nof soil bacteriology prosecuted by Mr. John Hunter and Professor\r\nMcAlpine on Lord Roseberry’s estate of Dalmeny, and “manuring with\r\nbrains” to the application of them. Attention has been called to\r\nthe value of the bacteria in the soil as nitrifying and fertilizing\r\nelements by the experiments of Sir John Bennet Lawes and Sir Joseph\r\nHenry Gilbert at Rothamsted, and more forcibly by experiments coming\r\nafter them but suggested by them. It had also been found that caustic\r\nlime used upon the soil is liable to destroy the nitrifying and other\r\nadvantageous organisms, while carbonate of lime is surely useful, and\r\na due proportion of lime compounds is essential to the best discharge\r\nof their functions. The discovery that the bacteria of the root\r\nnodules of leguminous plants possess the power of absorbing the free\r\nnitrogen of the atmosphere and rendering it available for the use of\r\nthe plant was made by Messrs. Hunter and McAlpine, according to Mr.\r\nYoung, and was taught by them to their students several years before\r\nHellriegel, to whom it is usually ascribed, fell upon it. They found\r\nthat several well-defined sets of bacteria were concerned in the work\r\nof nitrification, and isolated and cultivated the nitrous germ, but\r\ncould accomplish nothing with the nitric germ till they used old mortar\r\nor some lime dressing with it. They also found that lime compounds\r\nin the surface soil served a further important use by preventing the\r\nsoluble silicates from being taken up by the roots of the plant, the\r\nlime taking up those salts and forming insoluble silicates which\r\nwere retained in the soil and did not diffuse into the plant. So a\r\nnon-silicated stem, or a cellulose stem, was formed, which would bend\r\nbefore the wind without breaking, while the non-silicated straw was\r\nmuch superior in value to the silicated straw. Messrs. Hunter and\r\nMcAlpine denied that silica in the plant gave strength and solidity\r\nto the stem, and pointed out that it rather, like glass, made the\r\nstraw brittle. They found out, further, that large quantities of\r\ncarbonic acid were produced in the soil through the operation of the\r\nferments, and found an outlet through the subsoil drains. They made\r\nother discoveries which threatened to render it necessary to revise\r\nthe whole fabric of agricultural science, and were called to account\r\nby the institutions in which they were teachers for their heresies.\r\nThey maintained their position till the opportunity came to them to\r\nmake tests of their theories on Lord Rosebery’s Dalmeny farm. Among the\r\nresults of the Dalmeny experiments are proof of the value of a dressing\r\nof ground lime in proportions not large enough to kill the bacteria,\r\nemphasis of the value of potash for every crop, and the discovery of a\r\nremedial treatment for the finger-and-toe pest in turnips. “When these\r\nexperiments were commenced, ground lime for agricultural purposes had\r\nnever been heard of, whereas now there are at least six lime works\r\nwhere extensive grinding plants are kept hard at work to supply the\r\never-increasing demand for that substance. Since the principles for the\r\nnew soil science have been put in successful practice at Dalmeny the\r\nscientific authorities, who at first had branded these principles as\r\nabsurd heresies, have changed their tune,” and now the chemical adviser\r\nof the Highland Society has declared that he accepts the new doctrines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Plague Antitoxin.=--In justifying his belief in the efficacy of the\r\ninoculation treatment against the plague, Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of\r\nIndia, said, in a recent address at Poonah: “If I find, as I do find,\r\nout of one hundred plague seizures among uninoculated persons, the\r\naverage number who die is somewhere about seventy to eighty per cent,\r\nwhile, in a corresponding number of seizures among inoculated persons,\r\nthe proportions are entirely reversed and seventy to eighty per cent,\r\nif not more, are saved--and these calculations have been furnished from\r\nmore than one responsible quarter--I say figures of that kind can not\r\nfail to carry conviction; and I altogether fail to see how, in the face\r\nof them, it is possible for any one to argue that inoculation is not\r\na wise and necessary precaution.” He had been personally visiting the\r\nplague hospitals and camps about the city, and had already supported\r\nhis advocacy of this treatment by having himself and his party\r\ninoculated at Simla with the plague antitoxin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Cultivation of India Rubber.=--An article in the Bulletin of the\r\nBureau of American Republics represents that there are lands in\r\nMexico and Central America equally adapted to the cultivation of the\r\nIndia-rubber tree with the Brazilian plantations, and having, in\r\naddition, a salubrious climate. Formerly dependence for the supply of\r\nIndia rubber was placed in the product of wild trees, but with the\r\nincrease in the uses for it, and the consequent rise in prices, capital\r\nis being invested in this industry, and its profitable cultivation is\r\nbeing largely engaged in. The trees do not flourish at an elevation\r\nexceeding five hundred feet above sea level, and low land, moist but\r\nnot swampy, is the best. Land suitable for planting could be bought\r\nfor twenty-five cents an acre in large tracts, but it now brings from\r\ntwo dollars to five dollars Mexican. These lands can be used for other\r\ncrops while the trees are growing up, and thus made partly to repay\r\nthe cost of starting the plantation. So the expense of clearing the\r\nland preparatory to planting it is largely met, if facilities for\r\ntransplantation are at hand, by the sale of the dyewoods, sandalwood,\r\nsatinwood, ebony, and mahogany that are cut off. The land should be\r\nchosen along the banks of streams, where the soil is rich, deep, and\r\nloamy, and the presence of wild rubber trees is a sure indication of\r\nits suitability. These wild trees should be left standing, and young\r\nseedlings should be kept and transplanted into their proper places. The\r\ndensest plantation compatible with good results is fifteen feet apart,\r\ngiving about one hundred and ninety-three trees to the acre. Once in\r\nthe ground, the tree needs no attention or cultivation beyond keeping\r\ndown the undergrowth, which can be effected by the aid of a side crop.\r\nThe tree propagates itself by the seeds or nuts, which drop in May and\r\nJune. By the sixth or seventh year the grove will be in bearing, and\r\nthereafter should yield from three to five pounds of India rubber per\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=The New York Botanical Garden’s Museum.=--The museum building of the\r\nNew York Botanical Garden is substantially completed, and most of\r\nthe works are in an advanced state of forwardness. The museum cases\r\n(for public inspection) and the herbarium cases (for students) are in\r\nposition, and the herbarium cases are filled. Among the recent gifts\r\nof value to the institution are the miscellaneous collection of John\r\nJ. Crooke, made about thirty years ago and containing about twenty\r\nthousand specimens, among which are a set of the plants obtained by\r\nthe United States Pacific Exploring Expedition of about 1850; the\r\ncollection of between twenty and thirty thousand specimens made by Dr.\r\nF. M. Hexamer in Switzerland and the United States; a collection of\r\nseven or eight thousand numbers, made by Mr. and Mrs. A. A. Heller,\r\nrepresenting between twelve and thirteen hundred species, some of which\r\nare new to science; and specimens of crude drugs, for the Economic\r\nMuseum, presented by Parke, Davis & Co. A permanent microscopic\r\nexhibition is to be established by Mr. William E. Dodge, at his own\r\nexpense. It will be furnished with at least twenty-five microscopes,\r\nand with specimens carefully prepared and inclosed, to secure them\r\nfrom injury. A set of more than two hundred volumes on botany and\r\nhorticulture, which formed a part of the library of Dr. David Hosack,\r\nfounder of the first botanical garden in New York, has been presented\r\nby the New York Academy of Medicine, which received it from the New\r\nYork Hospital.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Action of Sea Water on Cements.=--As the result of examinations of\r\nmany masonry structures immersed in sea water, Dr. Wilhelm Michaelis\r\nhas found that Portland cement does not resist the chemical action of\r\nsuch water so well as do Roman cement and the hydraulic cements. The\r\nsoluble sulphates in the sea water appear to enter into a substitution\r\ncombination with the lime which exists in the cement in a free state\r\nor is liberated in the hardening, and it is converted into a sulphate,\r\nwhile disintegration ensues. In Roman cement the lime exists in\r\ncombination, and there is no inclination toward the formation of\r\na sulphate, and hydraulic limes resemble Roman cement in physical\r\nqualities. Dr. Michaelis suggests that hydraulic cementing materials\r\ncontaining more lime than is required for the formation of stable\r\nhydro-silicate and aluminate may be made suitable for submarine work by\r\nan admixture of trass or puzzolana, whereby the cementing strength of\r\nthe mass will be greatly increased, and it will be enabled to withstand\r\nthe disintegrating action of the sea water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Stories of Amazonian Pygmies.=--Dr. D. G. Brinton subjected the\r\nstories of the existence of pygmy tribes on the upper tributaries of\r\nthe Amazon to a careful examination, and came to the conclusion that\r\nthe facts did not show anything more than that there are undersized\r\ntribes in that part of South America, with occasional individual\r\nexamples of dwarfs, such as occur in all communities. It is still a\r\nquestion, he observed, “whether the rumor of a pygmy people somewhere\r\nin the tropical forests is not to be classed with the stories which\r\nthrew a strange glamour about those inaccessible regions in the early\r\ndays of the discovery. There were many of these, for I am speaking of\r\nthe part of the map where was located the El Dorado, the golden city of\r\nManoa, the home of the warlike Amazons; where dwelt the men with tails\r\nand the mysterious _Oyacoulets_, warriors with white skin, blue eyes,\r\nand long, blond beards. All have vanished from history but the pygmies,\r\nand their turn will probably soon come.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Relief and Pension Funds of Railroad Men.=--In instituting a pension\r\nfund for the men in its employ the Pennsylvania Railroad established,\r\nin addition and supplementary to the relief fund of which they\r\nenjoy the privilege, a special fund for those who are retired or\r\nsuperannuated, which is adjusted according to their length of service\r\nand the pay they have been receiving. The relief fund affords every\r\nman employed an opportunity to provide for himself in case of sickness\r\nor disability. It is co-operative, and is supported jointly by the\r\nemployed men, its members, and the company, the expenses of operation\r\nand the deficiencies in it being met by the company. The additional\r\npension is the company’s own undertaking. Besides the manifestly\r\nhumane purpose of this arrangement--to care for the present and future\r\ninterests of its men--it promises to work to increase and improve the\r\neffectiveness of the company’s service. Its tendency will be to give\r\nthe men greater heart in their work, and to cause them to identify\r\nthemselves more fully with it. Decent provision being made for the\r\nretirement of old hands, the service can be kept manned by a younger\r\nand more robust class. The new fund will effect the entire force on the\r\nlines of the Pennsylvania system east of Pittsburg and Erie, extending\r\nover a trackage of more than forty-one hundred miles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=The Broom as a Spreader of Disease.=--Dust being now generally\r\nrecognized as one of the most efficient vehicles of the germs of\r\ndisease, Dr. Max Girsdansky finds the broom to be one of the most\r\nactive agents in sending them into air, where it is diffused by\r\nwhatever breezes may be blowing there. The housewife digs the dust\r\nout of her carpets and stirs it out of the quiet corners where it has\r\naccumulated, wearing an old dress and covering her head while she\r\nleaves her lungs exposed, then shakes her rugs in the yard, and the\r\nstreet sweeper transfers the dust he has charge of from the pavement\r\nto the atmosphere, where we can breathe our fill of consumption from\r\nday to day. Therefore, the author holds, the broom, “far from serving\r\nany hygienic purpose, is the cause of the maintenance of organic dust\r\nin the atmosphere of the large cities of the world, and as such is the\r\nmost important cause of the existence and spread of tuberculosis.”\r\nFurther, the carpet is pronounced “an unhygienic article, serving\r\nas a fine breeding ground for vegetable parasites, necessitating\r\nthe use of the broom and the duster, and thereby becoming a reason\r\nfor the existence of organic dust.” As the only proper and safe way\r\nof procuring the cleanliness of the floors and streets of our large\r\ncities, Dr. Girsdansky advises the free use of water in the shape\r\nof showers, or with sprinkling wagons, hoes, mops, etc., and that\r\nall floors and floor coverings of the house and the street be so\r\nconstructed as to facilitate the free use of water in these ways.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Alkali Soils in Montana.=--Mr. F. W. Traphagen, of the Montana\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station, ascribes the origin of the alkali\r\nsoil in the arid regions to the failure of the elements to remove\r\nthe soda salts set free on the disintegration of the rocks, which in\r\nhumid regions are taken up and washed away by the rains. The soluble\r\nsalts are dissolved by the water that falls on the surface, and are\r\ncarried down when it soaks through the ground, to form an element in\r\nthe ground water. They return thence to the soil when water is brought\r\nup by capillary action to supply the place of that lost by surface\r\nevaporation, and accumulate there. Then, as the water evaporates\r\nthey are left on the surface, forming, when in sufficient quantity,\r\nthe white crusts seen in badly alkalied places. The most effective\r\nremedy for alkali might probably be found in underdrainage, which\r\nwould prevent the ground water rising to the top, and would carry\r\noff the salts. This being at present impracticable on the large scale\r\nthat would be required, such expedients as surface flooding and such\r\ncultivation of crops as would tend to check evaporation are suggested.\r\nThe pernicious effects of “black alkali” or sodium carbonate are\r\nseen when it forms as much as about one tenth of one per cent of the\r\nsoil, in the corrosion and solution of vegetable matter--the stems of\r\nplants--exposed to it. It also dissolves the humus or vegetable mold,\r\nforming dark-colored solutions and depositing a black residue upon\r\nthe evaporation of the water--whence its name--and it destroys the\r\ntillability of many soils. The “white alkali” or sodium sulphate can\r\nbe borne in much larger proportions in the soil, and promotes the best\r\ncrops just before it completely destroys them. The author remarks that\r\nthe foundations of a number of buildings in Billings, Montana, are\r\ngradually becoming insecure because of the disintegration of the rock,\r\ndue to the absorption of alkali salts, followed by the evaporation of\r\nthe water and the deposit of salts within the pores of the rock. As the\r\nprocess continues, the rock particles are forced apart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Future of the New York Canals.=--The Committee on Canals of New York\r\nState recommend decidedly in their report to the Governor that those\r\nhighways should not be abandoned but maintained, and the principal ones\r\nenlarged, while the others should be kept up as navigable feeders. Of\r\ntwo projects for enlarging the Erie Canal, that undertaken in 1895,\r\nwith modifications to be executed at a cost of $21,161,645, and a\r\nlarger one to cost $58,894,668, the committee prefer the larger one,\r\nbecause it will permanently secure the commercial supremacy of New\r\nYork, while the other is “at best only a temporary makeshift.” An\r\nimportant principle emphasized in the report is that the efficiency of\r\nthe canals depends upon their management as well as upon their physical\r\nsize. Therefore a policy should be followed that will encourage\r\ntransportation companies to seek the use of them; mechanical means of\r\ntraction should be employed, and mechanical power should be substituted\r\nfor hand power in certain operations; the force engaged upon them\r\nshould be organized on a more permanent basis of fitness, so as to\r\nfurnish an attractive career to graduates of scientific institutions;\r\nand efficient guards should be thrown over the expenditure of money “so\r\nas to make impossible a repetition of the unfortunate results of the\r\n$9,000,000 appropriation.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Floating Stones.=--While engaged in scientific research in southwest\r\nPatagonia, Mr. Erland Nordenskiold observed a considerable number of\r\nsmall fragments of slate floating upon the surface, packed together\r\nin larger or smaller clusters. The surface of the stones was dry, and\r\nthey sank immediately when it became wet. Their specific gravity was\r\n2.71, that of the water being 1.0049. The fragments contained no air\r\ncavities perceptible to the naked eye, but small, gaseous bubbles could\r\nbe seen attached to their under surfaces, and stones on the very fringe\r\nof the beach which were just beginning to float were observed to be\r\nlightened by gaseous bubbles. The author was not able to investigate\r\nthe phenomenon more closely, but believes that besides the visible\r\nbubbles they were surrounded by an envelope of gas, supported by an\r\ninsignificant coating of algæ, by which they are enveloped. The greasy\r\nsurface of the mineral also prevented the water from adhering to\r\nthem, and caused them to be surrounded with a concave meniscus, which\r\ncontributed much to their floating.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=The “Periodicity of War.”=--The doctrine of “the periodicity of\r\nwar” was presented at the Lake Mohonk Conference on International\r\nArbitration in May-June, 1899, by General Alfred C. Barnes, with the\r\nintroductory remark that “no one deprecates war more than the soldier\r\nwho serves from a sense of duty.” The speaker said that “with all\r\nour privileges, and in spite of the elevated spirit that undeniably\r\nprevails among us, the original savage lurks in the hearts of men here\r\nas elsewhere.” In two hundred and twenty-five years we have had ten\r\nprincipal wars--five during the colonial period and five since our\r\nindependence was undertaken. The average interval between wars has\r\nbeen about twenty years--“an extremely interesting periodicity, as it\r\nbrings into the arena a new race of fighting young men. So it seems\r\nthat for each fresh generation of our youth the temple gates of Janus\r\nhave to be opened, that the furies there confined may rush forth and\r\ndevastate the earth. It looks almost like the operation of a natural\r\nlaw.” General Barnes’s theory of the origin of the war that the United\r\nStates is still engaged in is the simple one that we were “spoiling for\r\na fight.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Expert Opinions respecting Food Preservatives.=--At a recent hearing\r\nbefore an English Official Committee on Preservatives and Coloring\r\nMatters in Food, the representative of an eminent firm of preservers\r\nsaid that preservatives were not very generally used with fruits and\r\njams. His firm regarded them as quite unnecessary, but he would not\r\nsay they ought to be prohibited if used in moderate quantity. Besides\r\ncoloring matter in vegetables, the only article used by his firm for\r\ncoloring was an extract of cochineal. Mr. John Tubb Thomas, a medical\r\nofficer, told of children who were injured by milk containing boracic\r\nacid, and said that in his experiments upon himself about fifteen\r\ngrains of that substance a day had upset his digestive organs and\r\nproduced sickness, with diarrhœa and headache. The use of the acid,\r\nhe said, should certainly be prohibited in new milk, which was so\r\nlargely the food of invalids and infants. Dr. W. H. Corfield said he\r\nhad found salicylic acid in the lighter wines and beers. It was a\r\nslightly acrid, irritating substance, which was used externally for the\r\nremoval of corns and warts, and was a most undesirable article to put\r\nin food. Mr. Walter Collingwood Williams, a public analyst, had found\r\nsalicylic acid in a number of temperance, non-alcoholic drinks. Dr.\r\nKaye, a medical officer of health, showed that the number of infant\r\ndeaths was increasing, while the general death rate was decreasing, and\r\nattributed the fact, partly at least, to the growing and excessive use\r\nof preservatives.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Pawnshops in Germany.=--Between half a dozen and a dozen of the\r\nstate pawnshops which were common in Germany in the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries still exist. The United States vice-consul at\r\nCologne has given a considerable list of municipal pawnshops in the\r\nmore important cities of all parts of Germany. On the whole, the\r\nnumber of these institutions is larger in Germany than in France, but\r\nsmaller than in Belgium, Holland, and Italy. The business of pawnshops\r\nappears, at least more recently, to depend less upon general economic\r\nthan on special, local causes. The German law has usually required\r\nprivate persons doing a pawnbroking business to take out special\r\nlicenses, and has exercised a more or less strict supervision over\r\nthem. The supervision practically lacked efficiency, and more stringent\r\nregulations were imposed by a statute enacted in 1879, which is now the\r\nbasis of the existing law of the German Empire. Under this law license\r\nis refused to persons who are unfitted for the business, and is not\r\nissued at any rate unless a necessity is shown for the institution.\r\nThe imperial law is supplemented by special laws of the various German\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Animals of the Ocean Depths.=--While plant life in the ocean is\r\nlimited to shallow waters, Sir John Murray says fishes and members\r\nof all the invertebrate groups are distributed over the floor of the\r\nocean at all depths. The majority of these deep-sea animals live by\r\neating the mud, clay, or ooze, or by catching the minute particles of\r\norganic matter which fall from the surface. It is probably not far from\r\nthe truth to say that three fourths of the deposits now covering the\r\nfloor of the ocean have passed through the alimentary canals of marine\r\nanimals. These mud-eating species, many of which are of gigantic size\r\nwhen compared with their allies living in the shallow coastal waters,\r\nbecome in turn the prey of numerous rapacious animals armed with\r\npeculiar prehensile and tactile organs. Many deep-sea animals present\r\narchaic characters; still, the deep sea can not be said to contain more\r\nremnants of fauna which flourished in remote geological periods than\r\nthe shallow and fresh waters of the continents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=The Site of Ophir.=--Dr. Carl Peters, an African explorer recently\r\nreturned to London, believes that he has found the Ophir whence King\r\nSolomon’s gold was brought, in the country between the Zambesi and\r\nthe Pungwa Rivers, in Portuguese Africa and eastern Mashonaland. Many\r\nrivers, some quite extensive, of undetermined origin, and traces of\r\nancient mining enterprises, are found in the region, and gold is still\r\nwashed there. One site is Fura, on the Muira River, about fifteen miles\r\nsouth of the Zambesi. The name Fura is said to be a native corruption\r\nof the word Afur, by which the Arabs of the sixteenth century called\r\nthe district, and that to be the Saharan or south Arabian form of the\r\nHebrew Ophir. The natives are unlike the ordinary Africans, and have a\r\ndistinctly Jewish type of face. A chief informed Dr. Peters concerning\r\nthe position of some ancient workings, and, following his directions,\r\nthe explorer found ruins “of an undoubtedly Semitic type.” Dr. Peters’s\r\nhypotheses and evidences must be accepted for what they are worth.\r\nOther explorers have found Ophir at various points in Africa and\r\nArabia, and even in India and elsewhere, and have been as satisfied and\r\nas sure as he with their identifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR PARAGRAPHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn instructive address, before the Iron and Steel Institute of\r\nGreat Britain, was recently delivered by Sir W. Roberts Austen on\r\nthe progress made in the iron and steel industries during the past\r\ncentury. The great revolution which the discovery of steel brought\r\nabout is dwelt upon at length, and its far-reaching importance, not\r\nonly in the iron industry itself but in all other industries and in the\r\ndestinies of England herself, pointed out. In the early days of the\r\nindustry it was held that the different qualities of iron were due to\r\nthe different localities from which the ore was obtained, but late in\r\nthe eighteenth century the great Swedish chemist, Bergman, of Upsala,\r\nclearly showed that carbon is the element to which steel and cast\r\niron owe their distinctive properties. Clouet’s celebrated experiment\r\non the carburization of iron by the diamond followed. “Well might\r\nBergman express astonishment at the action of carbon on iron. Startling\r\nas the statement may seem, the destinies of England throughout the\r\ncentury, and especially during the latter half of it, have been mainly\r\ninfluenced by the use of steel. Hardly a step of our progress or\r\nan incident of our civilization has not in one way or another been\r\ninfluenced by the properties of iron and steel. It is remarkable that\r\nthese properties have been determined by the relations subsisting\r\nbetween a mass of iron, itself protean in its nature, and the few\r\ntenths per cent of carbon it contains.” In 1800 the production of pig\r\niron in England was about 200,000 tons; in 1898 it was 8,769,249 tons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA note in Nature describes an ingenious arrangement for controlling\r\nthe direction of torpedoes by means of ether waves. Two solenoids,\r\ninto which are drawn iron cores, are attached to the rudder head, the\r\ncore which is drawn in depending, of course, upon the direction of the\r\nreceived current. Two rods projecting above the surface of the water\r\nreceive the waves and are in circuit with a coherer of special type,\r\nwhich affects a relay in the usual way. The actual processes involved\r\nin steering and controlling a torpedo are somewhat as follows: The\r\ntorpedo, containing a suitable combination of the apparatus above\r\nmentioned, is launched from a vessel containing the necessary sending\r\napparatus. Suppose the torpedo goes off its course. Then, by means of\r\na switch, an induction coil is supplied with an electric current, and\r\nwaves or oscillations are generated. These, on reaching the torpedo,\r\npass into the projecting wire and thence reach the coherer. This\r\noperates the relay, closing the secondary circuit. An electric current\r\nnow flows through a “selector” to one of the solenoids, the iron core\r\nis sucked into right or left, and the helm is thus turned. When the\r\ntorpedo has attained a proper course the switch is opened and the waves\r\ncease. The vibration in the neighborhood of the coherer restores it\r\nto the original resistance; the current passing through it becomes\r\nweaker and ceases to affect the relay coil, which therefore opens\r\nthe secondary circuit and allows the helm to fly back to the midship\r\nposition. A large model of the apparatus has been constructed, and it\r\nis said to work with entire success under all kinds of conditions. The\r\ninventors are Mr. Walter Jameson and Mr. John Trotter. It is stated\r\nthat Nikola Tesla has American patents for a somewhat similar device.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the absence of the author, Professor Dewar’s paper on the\r\nsolidification of hydrogen was read in the British Association by Sir\r\nWilliam Crook. It shows that solid hydrogen presents the appearance\r\nof frozen water, and not, as had been anticipated by many, of frozen\r\nmercury; hence it is now definitely decided that it is not metallic.\r\nThe temperature of the solid is 16° absolute at thirty-five millimetres\r\npressure, and it melts at 16° or 17° absolute, the practical limit\r\nof the temperature obtainable by its evaporation being 14° or 15°\r\nabsolute. Thus the last of the old gas has been solidified. It was\r\nfurther mentioned, in connection with these statements, that Professor\r\nDewar had succeeded in liquefying helium.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe organizing committees of the Congresses of Aëronautics and\r\nMeteorology--these being cognate subjects--of the Exposition of 1900\r\nhave decided to hold the meetings of these bodies in such a manner that\r\nall members can attend the sessions of both. The programme arranged for\r\nthe Aëronautical Congress contemplates the discussion, under aspects\r\nwhich are set forth in detail, of “problems” relating to free balloons,\r\ntheir management and use; captive balloons, steerable balloons, and\r\naviation; and the scientific applications of balloon observations to\r\nproblems in astronomy, meteorology, and physiology; also of their\r\nuse for purposes of reconnoissance and topographical surveys, and of\r\nphotography from balloons. In a different order of ideas, the congress\r\nmay occupy itself with questions of legislation and international law\r\nwhich concern aëronauts in times of peace and of war.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThree State catalogues of Ohio plants have heretofore been issued.\r\nThe first, by J. S. Newberry, was published in the State Agricultural\r\nReport in 1859; the second, by H. C. Beardslee, was published in\r\n1874, and was reprinted in the Agricultural Report for 1879; and\r\nthe third, by W. A. Kellerman and W. C. Werner, was included in the\r\nState Geological Report for 1893. This work contains a bibliography,\r\nand gives the names of the first known collectors of the less common\r\nspecies. A fourth catalogue, consisting of a checklist of the\r\n_Pteridophytes_ and _Spermophytes_, recently published by Prof. W. A.\r\nKellerman, contains the species and varieties numbered serially, as in\r\nthe State Herbarium of nearly ten thousand sheets, with the sequence of\r\ngroups as by Engler and Prantl, and the nomenclature as used by Britton\r\nand Brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\nThe committee of the St. Petersburg Astronomical Society for the\r\nrevision of the Russian calendar, to make it agree with the Gregorian,\r\nhas found it necessary to move slowly. The festivals prove a formidable\r\nobstacle to the desired reform, and the people will have to be prepared\r\nfor the change before it can be instituted. The plan now is to use\r\nboth dates, Russian and Gregorian, together till the new style can be\r\nmade familiar, and it is proposed to make the double use compulsory on\r\nprivate as well as on public documents and papers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA steamboat company is placing its little vessels on the canals of\r\nVenice, and the gondolas, which were one of the charms of the city to\r\ntravelers, are destined to disappear--unless a few may be reserved to\r\ngratify the curiosity of tourists.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Education of Rhode Island has issued a circular\r\nto teachers, calling attention to the work of the Audubon Society for\r\nthe Preservation of Birds, and to the incalculable value, from various\r\npoints of view, of bird life, and advises them to foster Nature study\r\nas furnishing a natural channel by means of which instruction and\r\ninformation on the subject may readily be brought before the children,\r\nand through them to the people generally.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a paper on The Ultimate Basis of Time Divisions in Geology, T.\r\nC.

He then raises the\r\nquestion whether this continuity of physical and vital action proceeded\r\nby heterogeneous impulses or by correlated pulsations. The author’s\r\nconclusion is in favor of the hypothesis of correlated pulsations\r\ninvolving a rhythmical periodicity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNettle fiber is said to be coming into great favor for the manufacture\r\nof fine yarns and tissues.

This estimate\r\nis for the aggregate areas within the boundaries of the reservations,\r\nbut the lands reserved are only the vacant public lands therein.

Seeds of barley, vegetable marrow, mustard, and\r\nthe pea were immersed in liquid hydrogen for six hours, cooled to a\r\ntemperature of 453° F. below the temperature of melting ice, and came\r\nout unchanged to the eye, and, when planted, all germinated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock, having been raised to the peerage, has adopted Lord\r\nAvebury as his title, and will be henceforth so known.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn our obituary list of men known to science are the names of N.
