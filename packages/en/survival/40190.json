Thus the parsnip, carrot, turnip, beet, &c., as we\r\nfind them in nature, have nowhere the large, fleshy, smooth appearance\r\nwhich belongs to their cultivated forms; and hence all the varieties of\r\nthese that we meet with in cultivation must be considered as\r\n_derivatives_ from original wild forms, obtained by _cultivative\r\nprocesses_; that is, collecting their seed, planting it in a prepared\r\nbed, stimulating the growth of the plants with manures, thinning,\r\nregulating, weeding, and such other acts as constitute farming or\r\ngardening, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nHence, then, it is concluded that such plants as are grown for their\r\nroots have a peculiar aptitude for laying on tissue, and thus increasing\r\nthe bulk of their “descending axis,” that is, that portion of their\r\nstructure which grows downwards—root. Besides this, they are remarkable\r\nfor their capability of producing varieties—a fact which, united with a\r\nconstancy in the maintenance of an induced form, renders it exceedingly\r\neasy to bring out new sorts which will maintain their characteristics\r\nunder great diversities of climate, soil, and treatment.\r\n\r\nThe facility with which different sorts of roots may be procured\r\ncan readily be understood from the many varieties, not only of\r\n_turnip_—which may perhaps be considered as an original species—but also\r\nof swede, which is a hybrid of the turnip and rape plant. Of the former\r\nwe have more than thirty sorts grown by the farmer, and as many\r\npeculiar to the garden; whilst there are probably more than twenty\r\nwell-recognized sorts of swedes. Of beets, with mangel-wurzel, we have\r\nalmost as great a variety; so also of carrots. Of parsnips we have fewer\r\nvarieties, to which may now be added the new form called the Student\r\nparsnip, the growth of which is so interesting that we shall here give a\r\nshort history of its production, as an illustration of the origin of\r\nroot crops.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 we collected some wild parsnip seed from the top of the\r\nCotteswolds, where this is among the most frequent of weeds. This seed,\r\nafter having been kept carefully during the winter, was sown in a\r\nprepared bed, in the spring of 1848, in drills about eighteen inches\r\napart. As the plants grew they were duly thinned out, leaving for the\r\ncrop, as far as it could be done, the specimens that had leaves with\r\nthe broadest divisions, lightest colour, and fewest hairs. As cultivated\r\nparsnips offer a curious contrast with the wild specimens in these\r\nrespects, we place the following notes, side by side, on the root-leaves\r\nof plants of the same period of growth.\r\n\r\n      1st.

Natural size.]\r\n\r\nWe have before remarked that neither in size nor form are the wild roots\r\nat all comparable with the cultivated ones. Our figures 1 and 2 were\r\ntaken from fine roots of the wild parsnip of the first year’s growth;\r\nthat is to say, just at the same time as a crop parsnip would be at its\r\nbest. They were purposely taken from specimens obtained from the same\r\ndistrict as the seed with which our experiments were commenced.\r\n\r\nOur first crop of roots from the wild seed presented great diversities\r\nin shape, being for the most part even more forked than the originals,\r\nbut still with a general tendency to fleshiness. Of these the best\r\nshaped were reserved for seeding; and having been kept the greater part\r\nof the winter in sand, some six of the best were planted in another plot\r\nfor seed. The seed, then, of 1849 was sown in the spring of 1850, in a\r\nfreshly-prepared bed, the plants being treated as before, the results\r\nshowing a decided improvement, with tendencies in some examples in the\r\nfollowing directions:—\r\n\r\n     1st. The round-topped long-root, having a resemblance to the\r\n     Guernsey parsnip. (_Panais long_ of the French.)\r\n\r\n     2nd. The hollow-crowned long-root. “Hollow-headed” of the gardener.\r\n     (_Panais Lisbonais_ type.)\r\n\r\n     3rd. The short, thick turnip-shaped root. “Turnip-rooted” of the\r\n     gardener. (_Panais rond_ form.)\r\n\r\nThese three forms were all of them much mis-shapen, with forked roots,\r\nthat is, _fingers and toes_; but still each of them offered\r\nopportunities of procuring three original varieties from this new\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nAs an example of progress, we offer the following engraving of a\r\nspecimen of our Round-topped parsnip of 1852. Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nThis it will be seen has strong, fleshy forks, and a tendency to form\r\ndivided tap-roots; otherwise the shape is greatly improved, and the skin\r\nis tolerably smooth.\r\n\r\nAt this time our stock was for the most part fleshy and soft on boiling;\r\nthe flavour, too, though much stronger than that of the usual esculent\r\nparsnip, was rather agreeable than otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis matter of flavour is a subject of interest, as most lovers of the\r\nparsnip, as a garden esculent, had got to complain of this root becoming\r\nmore and more tasteless. That this was so our own experience most fully\r\nconfirms; we have now, however, mended this root very materially in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nOur experiments were only carried on with examples of the Hollow-crowned\r\nform, which following out from year to year, we at length obtained so\r\nperfect in form, clean in outline, delicate in skin, and unexceptionable\r\nin flavour, that we were induced to cause its seed to be distributed\r\nthrough the medium of the trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 3._—Round-topped Parsnip, five generations from\r\nwild root.]\r\n\r\nIn 1881 we sowed a parcel of seed in our own garden obtained from the\r\nMessrs. Sutton, after having received from them the following notes upon\r\nthe growth of the roots in their grounds:—\r\n\r\n     We are happy to tell you that in lifting some of each of all the\r\n     varieties of parsnips in our trial-ground, your “Student” was\r\n     decidedly the best shape, varying in length, but always clean and\r\n     straight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 4._—Student Parsnip of 1861. Two-thirds of natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nThe engraving (Fig. 4) is taken from our garden stock of 1861, as being\r\na common shape of this new variety. It is not quite so long and slender\r\nas the usual Long-horned parsnip, but its clean unbranched outline and\r\nsolidity of structure recommend it as a good variety, whilst its flavour\r\nhas been highly extolled by the lover of this, to some, favorite root.\r\nIn size it is scarcely large enough for a field crop, but though not at\r\npresent recommenced for the farm, its history may well serve to explain\r\nthe origin of crop plants, as derived from the cultivation and\r\nimprovement of wild species.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] It may here be noted that the Student parsnip took the first prize\r\nfor this root at the International Show at the Horticultural Society’s\r\nGardens in 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nON THE ORIGIN OF SORTS OF ROOTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs crop plants are derived from wild ones, as the effect of cultivation,\r\nit follows as a matter of course that these will be varied, both in form\r\nand constitution, according to the circumstances under which they have\r\nbeen produced. Thus we may expect that any attempts to ennoble a wild\r\nroot in different countries would not, even if successful, be sure to\r\nbring about the same results. Much depends even upon the individual root\r\nwith which our trial may be started, and more upon the judgment employed\r\nin selecting the stock from which the experiments are to be continued.\r\n\r\nThat position and soil may make a great difference may be inferred from\r\nthe fact that the attempts to improve the wild parsnip and carrot have\r\nmet with varied success. De Candolle is reported to have tried to\r\nimprove the carrot with success, whilst with the parsnip he utterly\r\nfailed; whilst Professor Lindley, in Morton’s “Cyclopædia of\r\nAgriculture,” tells us that M. Ponsard has ascertained that “the wild\r\nparsnip becomes improved immediately when cultivated, and that\r\nexperiments in improving its quality promise well:” how well, indeed,\r\nmay be seen from the foregoing chapter. But still, we utterly failed\r\nwith the wild carrot. Having collected seeds of the _Daucus Carota_ (the\r\ncommon wild carrot) from some fine specimens growing on the road-side\r\nbetween Cirencester and Cheltenham, they were subjected to experiment at\r\nthe same time as the parsnip, but with little, if any, favourable\r\nresult. Upon this plant Professor Lindley observes as follows:—\r\n\r\n     That the hard-rooted wild carrot is really the parent of our\r\n     cultivated varieties, remarkable as they are for the succulence and\r\n     tenderness of their roots, has been experimentally proved by M.\r\n     Vilmorin, who succeeded in obtaining by cultivation perfectly\r\n     tender, eatable roots, from seeds saved from plants only three or\r\n     four generations off the wild species.\r\n\r\nStill, a modern French naturalist of great experience, M. Decaisne,\r\ntells us that he has tried to ennoble the wild carrot, and has not\r\nsucceeded; and from this he draws the conclusion that our cultivated\r\nforms were created specially for the use of man. As we should suppose\r\nthat very few botanists agree to this theory, we shall let the facts we\r\nhave already brought forward stand in maintenance of its opposite,\r\nnamely, that cultivated forms are derived from wild species often\r\napparently very different; but at the same time it may be well to state,\r\nthat in all probability some of the discrepancies of experimenters may\r\nhave arisen from some confusion in the species operated upon.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 we gathered some seed of the _Daucus maritima_ (sea-side carrot)\r\nat Bognor, which, on being sown in a prepared plot the following spring,\r\ncertainly resulted in fairly succulent roots, which on being cooked were\r\npronounced by our party of four to be excellent. While on this subject,\r\nit may be mentioned as not a little remarkable, that so many of our\r\ngarden esculents should be derived from sea-side plants. Thus, probably\r\ncarrot, but certainly celery, sea-kale, asparagus, and cabbage. This\r\nwould seem to point to the fact that cultivation requires a complete\r\nchange of the circumstances necessary to maintain a wild condition; and\r\nhence cultivated plants can only be kept up by the labours of a\r\ncultivator.\r\n\r\nNow, as regards the sea-side carrot, we are after all inclined to the\r\nbelief that it is the parent of the cultivated varieties, whilst, on the\r\nother hand, we view the _Daucus Carota_ (the wild inland carrot) as a\r\nprobable descendant from the cultivated or garden stock; and if this be\r\nso, the _Daucus maritima_ is the original species from which both the\r\nwild and cultivated races have descended. Bentham, indeed, carries this\r\nview a little further, the following remarks tending to throw doubts\r\nupon the carrot in any form as being a true native. Under the heading of\r\n_Daucus Carota_ he says:—\r\n\r\n     Probably an original native of the sea-coasts of modern Europe, but\r\n     of very ancient cultivation, and sows itself most readily, soon\r\n     degenerating to the wild form, with a slender root, and _now_ most\r\n     abundant in fields, pastures, waste places, &c., throughout Europe\r\n     and Russian Asia; common in Britain, especially near the sea.\r\n     _Flowers the whole summer and autumn._ A decidedly maritime\r\n     variety, with the leaves somewhat fleshy, with shorter segments,\r\n     more or less thickened peduncles, more spreading umbels, and more\r\n     flattened prickles to the fruits, is often considered as a distinct\r\n     species.\r\n\r\nSeeing then that crop plants are derivatives from a wild stock, we can\r\nreadily understand how the varying circumstances attendant upon the\r\ndevelopment of the former should tend to the production of varieties,\r\nand this merely as the result of the treatment of the fairly derived\r\nlegitimate seed. If, again, we take these variations for the purpose of\r\nobtaining hybrids, we need not wonder at the infinite variety of sorts\r\nwhich can be brought about, but rather that any sort could be maintained\r\nin that trueness of character or in that state of permanency which we\r\nsometimes find to be the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nON TRUENESS OF SORT IN ROOT CROPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of trueness and purity of seed arises from the evenness\r\nof growth of a good genuine strain; while if this quality be wanting we\r\nhave some parts of our crop growing well, whilst others get on but\r\npoorly. Thus a free-growing plant beside one over which it has got the\r\nadvantage, maintains it for the most part through the whole period of\r\ngrowth. Again, some sorts are of value for being early, others for\r\nlateness of growth, and some kinds are better fitted for early than late\r\nsowing; if, therefore, we have a mixture in these respects, we may at\r\nleast expect a partial failure; for whichever is _best_ for our purpose,\r\nif mixed will be accompanied by those which are not so good. A want of\r\ntrueness to sort may arise principally from the following causes:—\r\n\r\n1st. Want of selection in seeding bulbs.\r\n\r\n2nd. Hybridization.\r\n\r\n3rd. A mixture of seeds.\r\n\r\n1st. The propriety of selecting the specimens from which seed is to be\r\ngrown is admitted by all: by the seedsman, who always advertises his\r\nturnip and swede seed, for example, as being “from selected bulbs;” and\r\nby the farmer, as this announcement is only made to induce him to buy.\r\nIt is not only important that the roots should be selected, but that\r\nthey should be stored and then planted in a fresh soil; for as these\r\nlatter are among the _cultivative processes_ by which sorts have been\r\nobtained, so should they be repeated in order to ensure a continuance of\r\nthe induced condition. Seeding upon the same soil and in the same bed in\r\nwhich the seed is sown is hardly the way to keep up a form induced by\r\ncultivation, as this is exactly what would be done by the plants in a\r\nstate of wildness.\r\n\r\nIn selecting roots for seeding, care should be taken to choose\r\ngood-shaped examples, in which a clean unbranched bulb, not too large,\r\nwith a small tap-root and a small top, confined to a single central bud;\r\na branched root and a many-headed top being true signs of degeneracy.\r\nAnd no less so is neckiness in swedes and mangels, as well as a coarse\r\ncorrugated skin in roots of all kinds.\r\n\r\nTaking such points as these into consideration, how absurd must appear\r\nmost of the huge mis-shapen roots to which prizes are usually awarded at\r\nshows, where the specimens are chosen for size, and trimmed up with the\r\nknife, to make them look more presentable. As an evidence of the\r\nmistaken principles upon which prizes are awarded to bundles of roots,\r\nlet any one seed such examples, and we will venture to assert that such\r\nseed would produce a large proportion of degenerate examples, without\r\naffording so good a crop as would seed, from middle-sized but\r\nwell-shapen specimens.\r\n\r\n2nd. Some of the forms of roots, and more especially those belonging to\r\nthe _Brassicaceæ_, such as turnips and swedes, seem to have a wonderful\r\nfacility for hybridizing; and this not only to the extent of one sort of\r\nturnip with another, but sports may be caused by the fertilization of\r\nthe turnip with rape and its congeners. Indeed, the hybrid with turnip\r\nand rape is doubtless the origin of the Swedish turnip; but there is\r\nreason to believe that mixtures may accidentally be made with such wild\r\nplants as charlocks and mustards, the growth of which in the vicinity of\r\na seeding crop tends to the production of degeneracy. Seeding-patches,\r\nthen, and the ground about them, cannot be kept too clean.\r\n\r\nAgain, if trueness be aimed at, there should be no mixture of sorts in\r\nseeding examples; all of the same kind should be selected for\r\nseeding-plots, as even one or two of a wrong sort may result in a very\r\nmixed sample, as it would seem that sometimes strange plants exert more\r\nthan ordinary influence.\r\n\r\nOf course, the putting seeding-patches of different sorts side by side\r\nis to be reprehended. If more than one sort be seeded in a season, it is\r\nadvisable to place the patches as remote from each other as possible.\r\nAnd we would here remark, that, for seeding, the roots should, as a\r\nrule, be farther apart than when grown for bulbs, both in rows and in\r\nsets; as, if too close, the stems grow up thin instead of robust, and a\r\nsmaller seed, with a tendency to the growth of smaller roots, will be\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\n3rd. Mixtures of seeds should be avoided for the reason assigned, that\r\n“sorts” do not usually grow evenly; and when one sees (as is by no means\r\ninfrequent) a patch of swedes overshadowed by a mixture of some large\r\nearly turnip,—the Tankard, for example, our crop of swedes will\r\ncertainly suffer for it, even supposing the turnip to be as useful as\r\nthe swede, which is seldom the case.\r\n\r\nMixtures, again, do not come up at the same time; sorts may differ in\r\nthis respect, but especially do old and new seeds vary as to their\r\ngerminating powers: two-year-old seeds taking four or five days more to\r\ncome up than a new sample; thus giving a greater chance for the ravages\r\nof the flea-beetle than where the seed all comes up quickly.\r\n\r\nNow, as a practical application of these remarks, we here quote from an\r\narticle in the _Agricultural Gazette_ of May 24th, 1862.\r\n\r\n     Who among seedsmen does not profess to offer the seeds of swedes\r\n     and turnips from _selected bulbs_? And though it is quite true that\r\n     the practice is not so universal as is the profession of it, yet\r\n     the general assumption of its being so on the part of seed growers\r\n     and sellers is an admission that it would be for the advantage of\r\n     the buyer of seeds were the roots from which seeds are to be grown\r\n     carefully selected. And on the other hand, let the observant\r\n     agriculturist take a journey on any of our great lines of railway\r\n     (in early summer), and he will be struck with the many patches of\r\n     bright yellow flowers which he will not fail to notice on either\r\n     hand. In nine cases out of ten, these are fields or portions of\r\n     fields of turnips, either the Swedish or common kinds, which, from\r\n     the abundance of keep, it has been thought would be more profitable\r\n     to seed than to eat off, especially as they have so rapidly grown\r\n     out of the way. Are these patches of selected bulbs? We happen to\r\n     know, from a more than ordinarily careful examination, that not one\r\n     _per cent._ of seeding-patches are from selected roots; but they\r\n     are seeded just as they grew, and we do not know of a single\r\n     instance where in such seeding the objectionable roots have been\r\n     removed; but we do know of plenty of cases where the worst part of\r\n     a field has been saved for seed, doubtless as the most profitable\r\n     way of dealing with it under the circumstances wrought out by the\r\n     spring of 1862.\r\n\r\n     Of course, this will all come into the market, and too much of it,\r\n     under a stereotyped declaration of ‘_from selected bulbs_.’ That\r\n     all the seed grown in 1862 will be sown in 1863 is simply\r\n     impossible; but no matter, it will find a market somehow, some\r\n     time. With such facts as these before us, who can wonder that any\r\n     plant should become degenerate? Let some of the seed of this year\r\n     be watched, and we will answer for its evil results; and if these\r\n     be facts, it then behoves the farmer to look well to pedigree in\r\n     the matter of his seed.\r\n\r\n     But even here, his forethought must not end; for however select the\r\n     parent may be, there is still something in ‘bringing up;’ for,\r\n     however good the _sort_ of turnip, we shall not grow its seed in\r\n     perfection by selection merely, but we should _transplant_\r\n     well-chosen roots, and so put them in a new scene, away from\r\n     subjects which might contaminate them. This is indeed to bring them\r\n     up in a _good school_, for which their seed will amply repay the\r\n     trouble and expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nON DEGENERATE ROOTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the reader revert to page 6, Fig. 3, he will see that the progress\r\nfrom a wild to a better root-form is marked by a more fleshy, but still\r\na much forked, or finger-and-toed example. Now as it is held that a\r\nclear unbranched outline is essential to a well-formed root crop of\r\nevery kind, whenever a crop becomes fingered-and-toed, it is looked upon\r\nas a disease. It must be understood that we are here speaking of\r\nfinger-and-toe as distinct from anbury, which latter is a decidedly\r\ndiseased condition, whether caused by insects or resulting, as some\r\naffirm, from a defect in the soil.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the two states may be briefly summed up as follows:—\r\n\r\n        FINGER-AND-TOE.            |           ANBURY.\r\n                                   |\r\n  Root simply branched or forked,  | Root infested with irregular\r\n  with tapering fleshy rootlets;   | nodular protuberances, or with\r\n  occurs in turnips, parsnips,     | tumours suspended by roots,\r\n  carrots, and mangold. (See       | having very much the aspect of\r\n  figs. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,    | rows of ginger; occurs in\r\n  10.)                             | turnips alone. (See fig. 12.)\r\n\r\nThe example of a root at page 6 is a good form of a parsnip progressing\r\nfrom wildness to a better cultivated form. We now offer an engraving\r\n(fig. 5) of a hollow-crowned crop parsnip, fingered-and-toed, and\r\nevidently of a very objectionable form, as it will be seen on\r\ncomparison how nearly alike are figs. 3 and 5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 5._—Finger-and-toed degenerate Parsnip. Half nat.\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nNow, as every degenerate crop of parsnips will be found to offer a large\r\nproportion of such roots as fig. 5, we seem bound to conclude that,\r\ninasmuch as our fig. 3 _represents a root in progress towards\r\nennobling_, so fig. 5 is that of a root declining to its level,—in other\r\nwords, degenerating; seed, therefore, that produces such roots can only\r\ncome from a poor stock.\r\n\r\nOur next fig. (6) is of a parsnip that had prematurely flowered. Sending\r\nup flowered stems the first year, in the case of a biennial, can only be\r\nlooked upon as an instance of degeneracy. Plants that “run,” as it is\r\ntermed, being comparatively useless, the best use, indeed, that can be\r\nmade of them being that of pulling them up and giving them to the pigs.\r\n\r\nNow this propensity is always accompanied with forked roots, more\r\nespecially in carrots, which roots are even more degenerate than those\r\nrepresented in figs. 3 and 5, as those were fleshy and succulent; but\r\nwhen the roots of runners are examined, they are always found to be\r\ntough and woody, and, in fact, they very nearly resemble the wild\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 6._ Carrot of First Year run to Seed. Half nat.\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nFig. 7 is taken from a carrot that has run, and its rough, woody,\r\nnodular, forked root is fully apparent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 7._ Forked Carrot run to seed. Half nat. size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 8._ Forked Belgian Carrot. Half nat. size.]\r\n\r\nFig. 8, from a specimen of White Belgian carrot, forked as it is, is yet\r\nnot uncommon; still, here the divided roots are succulent. This differs\r\nfrom the annual or run-to-seed roots, as this is a real biennial; but\r\nits other mark of degeneracy, besides that of finger-and-toe, was in its\r\npossessing a top (removed for experiment before the drawing was made) of\r\nmany buds or heads. Now a _multiheaded_ root, whether in turnips,\r\ncarrots, parsnip, or mangel, is another sign of degeneracy, especially\r\nin the carrot or mangel, as the wild examples are remarkable for this\r\ncondition; and in ennobling these roots, one of the difficulties is to\r\nget rid of this propensity. Hence, at root shows all forked examples of\r\nbulbs, multiheaded and necky examples, should be rejected; they are,\r\nhowever, sometimes made so fat with manuring that they pass muster for\r\nsize, which indeed seems to be the great quality required at shows:\r\nwhich is a serious mistake, as being no sort of criterion of the state\r\nof a field of roots, unless it be an adverse one: as a 10 lb. malformed\r\nroot, with its huge top, will require more ground to grow than will half\r\na dozen roots averaging 2 lbs. each; whilst the latter are certain to be\r\nbetter and will keep longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF GROWING SEED FROM DEGENERATE ROOTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the seed of malformed roots would be likely to produce a poor crop\r\nwas a subject admitted by all; but neither the form nor extent of the\r\nmischief resulting therefrom had been stated upon the authority of exact\r\nexperiment. In order, therefore, to arrive at direct evidence upon a\r\npoint upon which so much of practical importance depends, we carefully\r\ncarried out the following experiments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 9._ A Malformed or Degenerate Parsnip. Two-thirds\r\nof nat. size.]\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of March, 1860, we selected two roots from a store, namely,\r\none of a Student parsnip from our own stock and one of a Skirving’s\r\nswede. Before committing these to the ground for the growth of seed, we\r\nmade careful portraits of the two roots, of which that of the parsnip\r\nwill be found in fig. 9, that of the swede in fig. 10.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 10._ A Malformed or Degenerate Swede. Two-thirds of\r\nnat. size.]\r\n\r\nNow had we been going to grow the best of seed, we should of course have\r\nselected the best-shaped roots for our purpose; but in this case, as\r\nwill be seen, the most viciously formed examples were chosen.\r\n\r\nBoth of the examples whose portraits we have here given, were planted in\r\nour private garden (where, it is right to say, they were the only\r\nseeding specimens), in due time their seed ripened, which was carefully\r\ncollected and stored.\r\n\r\nEarly in April, 1861, these seeds were sown in our experimental plots,\r\n_without manure_, in the following order:—\r\n\r\n  Plot _a._ Seed obtained from the malformed parsnip, fig. 9.\r\n\r\n       _b._ Seed of Student parsnip of the same year as that of\r\n            plot _a_.\r\n\r\n       _c._ Seed of malformed swede.\r\n\r\nThe plot _b_ was sown by way of comparison, and we can only regret that\r\nno plot of good swede seed was sown with the same object, and we must,\r\ntherefore, compare with a piece of swedes in an adjoining field.\r\n\r\nThe following are the tabulated results:—\r\n\r\n  TABLE OF RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\n                                          lb. oz.\r\n  Plot _a_. 75 roots, forming the crop }\r\n  from seed of the malformed           }   7   4\r\n  parsnip (fig. 8) weighed in all      }\r\n\r\n  Plot _b_. 63 roots forming the crop  }  14   0\r\n  from seed of good Student parsnips   }\r\n\r\n  Plot _c_. 70 roots of swedes from    }\r\n  seed of malformed plant (fig. 10.)   }  19   8\r\n\r\n            70 roots from a row in the }\r\n  field, at a distance of about 30     }  35   0\r\n  yards                                }\r\n\r\nThe roots from plot _a_ may be described as small, though not so much\r\nfingered-and-toed as we had expected; still there was only about half\r\nthe crop when compared with plot _b_, which latter, indeed, was only\r\nsmall in weight, which may be accounted for from being grown without\r\nmanure. During their progress of growth the difference was very\r\nperceptible—the small leaves of _a_ contrasting most unfavourably with\r\nthe broader, brighter coloured ones of _b_.\r\n\r\nAs regards the swedes, they were indeed a very poor crop, presenting all\r\nthe evils of degeneracy—neckiness, for which it will be seen that their\r\nparent was distinguished—want of a bulboid form; none of the 70 roots\r\nbeing better than a thin tap-root, and these were forked, shapeless, and\r\nfingered-and-toed in endless variety. Their spindle-shaped roots were\r\nquite remarkable, and they were the rule, although in good seed, however\r\nbad the soil, they would have been the exception. Those in the field\r\nhard by were bulboid, and averaged half a pound each—no great weight, as\r\nthe land in which they were grown is only second-rate. They, however,\r\nwere grown with manure, to which, of course, much of the difference is\r\ndue, and yet not so much as may fairly be imputed to the difference in\r\nseed. From these experiments we conclude:—\r\n\r\n     1st. That a degenerate stock will, as a rule, result from the\r\n     employment of degenerate or badly-grown seed.\r\n\r\n     2nd. That besides ugly, malformed roots, degenerated seed does not\r\n     produce nearly the weight of crop of good seed, under the same\r\n     circumstances of growth.\r\n\r\n     3rd. That by means of selection we may produce roots that are\r\n     well-shaped, and have the capabilities of affording the best crop.\r\n\r\n     4th. That by designedly selecting malformed degenerate roots for\r\n     seeding, we may produce a seed that will result in as great or\r\n     greater degeneracy.\r\n\r\n“That these are important conclusions”—we quote from the _Agricultural\r\nGazette_—“few will be disposed to deny. They have most interesting\r\nbearings on the subject of vegetable physiology, and consequently should\r\nbe studied by the farmer.”\r\n\r\nIt is a practice much to be desired, that not only should a proper\r\nchoice be made of seeding examples, but that there be a change of\r\nsituation, and, if possible, a time of storage before being planted for\r\nseed. These are all cultivative processes, and to the care with which\r\nthey are carried out must we look for permanence in our derivative\r\nroot-crops.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too strongly urged, that, as an efficient sort of root has\r\nonly been arrived at as the result of great care—that is, by successful\r\nbreeding,—so every care must be taken for its maintenance. Defect in\r\nseed results in defect in the produce of that seed; and downward\r\ntendencies of this kind are common results of even most careful\r\ncultivation. With carelessness in this respect we must not be surprised\r\nat rapid degeneracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nON THE ADULTERATION OF SEEDS, MORE PARTICULARLY OF TURNIPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to make the experiments which illustrate this chapter tell\r\ntheir tale to the fullest extent, we would set out with the two\r\nfollowing postulates:—\r\n\r\n     1st. All well-grown, well-preserved new seeds should be _capable_\r\n     of germinating to the extent of at least 90 per cent.\r\n\r\n     2nd. Seeds in general, and more especially turnip seeds, as usually\r\n     delivered to the farmer, are generally _incapable_ of germinating\r\n     to the extent of from 25 to 30 per cent., and very frequently even\r\n     more.\r\n\r\nWe shall hereafter see, that this want of germinating power is too often\r\nthe result of mixing charlock, Indian rape, and the like, by way of\r\nadulteration, which latter are killed to prevent “their telling tales.”\r\nBut to our experiments:—\r\n\r\nA number of tin cases were made of the following proportions: Length, 15\r\ninches; width, 10 inches; depth, 4 inches. These, which were well\r\nperforated at the bottom, were divided across into ten equal parts, each\r\nof which was filled to within an inch of the rim, with a mixture of fine\r\nmould and silver sand. In these, seeds of different sorts of turnips\r\nwere sown, and the whole was put into a bed of sand in our\r\nforcing-house. We could, however, see no difference in the results, nor\r\ncould we trace any in the germinal or cotyledon leaves of swedes,\r\nturnips, or charlock. But, of course, samples of turnip-seed could not\r\nbe tested as to freedom from charlock by this experiment, because\r\ncharlock is killed before being mixed with the turnip.\r\n\r\nNow, seeing that we could get no trustworthy results by this kind of\r\nexperiment, it struck us that our germination-pans might be used to test\r\nthe germinating power, not only of the samples we had obtained for a\r\ndifferent purpose, but of others also. We first, then, counted a hundred\r\nof each of the following sorts of seeds, and carefully dibbled them in a\r\nfresh mixture of soil, in September, 1860; the results, which were as\r\ncarefully noted from day to day, are shortly given in the following\r\ntable:—\r\n\r\nTABLE 1.—_Germination of Ten Sorts of Turnips._\r\n\r\n  +---+-------------------------------------+---------+------+---------+\r\n  |   |                                     | Came up |No. of|         |\r\n  |No.|       Name, Copy of Label.          |per cent.| Days.|         |\r\n  +---+-------------------------------------+---------+------+---------+\r\n  | 1 | Mousetail, 1859                     |    96   |  10  |         |\r\n  | 2 | Pomeranian, or White Globe, 1859    |    86   |  11  |         |\r\n  | 3 | Nimble Green Round, 1859            |    96   |   7  |         |\r\n  | 4 | Lincolnshire new Red Globe, 1860    |    90   |   9  |         |\r\n  | 5 | Yellow Tankard, 1859                |    92   |   9  |         |\r\n  | 6 | Smart’s Mousetail, 1860             |    98   |   7  |         |\r\n  | 7 | Green-topped Stone, 1860            |    84   |   8  |         |\r\n  | 8 | Sutton’s Imperial Green Globe, 1860 |    98   |   9  |         |\r\n  | 9 | Green-topped Scotch, 1860           |    90   |   9  |         |\r\n  |10 | Early Six-weeks, 1860               |    90   |  10  |         |\r\n  |   | Came up                            =|    92   |      |         |\r\n  |   | Failed                             =|     8   |      |         |\r\n  +---+-------------------------------------+---------+------+---------+\r\n\r\nWe would remark upon these results, that the temperature of the house\r\nwas kept at between 60° and 70°, and the greater part of the seeds came\r\nup in four days; the numbers for the days, then, have reference to the\r\ntime occupied before all that would germinate came up. Now this table is\r\nnot a little instructive, as showing that samples of turnip-seed can be\r\ngot in which only a very few of the seeds fail to germinate; but as\r\nexperience had taught us that these samples by no means represented the\r\nusual market condition of turnip-seeds, in order to test this we begged\r\nto be allowed permission to take samples direct from the bags of a\r\nretail seedsman as they were exposed in his shop, and the following\r\nresults will speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nIt should, however, be here premised that the samples were not grown by\r\nthe seedsman, but were said to be just as received from the wholesale\r\ndealers.\r\n\r\nTABLE 2.—_Germination of Ten Sorts of Turnip Seeds from Market Samples._\r\n\r\n  +---+-------------------------------------+---------+------+---------+\r\n  |   |                                     | Came up |No. of|         |\r\n  |No.|           Copy of Label.            |per cent.| Days.|         |\r\n  +---+-------------------------------------+---------+------+---------+\r\n  | 1 | Norfolk Green round                 |    76   |   9  |}        |\r\n  | 2 | White Globe                         |    78   |  15  |}        |\r\n  | 3 | Early Grey-topped Stone             |    80   |  10  |}        |\r\n  | 4 | Red Tankard, or Pudding             |    62   |  11  |}Taken   |\r\n  | 5 | Orange Jelly                        |    52   |  15  |}from the|\r\n  | 6 | Norfolk Round Red                   |    80   |  10  |}bags by |\r\n  | 7 | Purple-topped yellow Scotch         |    76   |  11  |}the     |\r\n  | 8 | White Dutch                         |    64   |  12  |}Author. |\r\n  | 9 | Early Green top                     |    64   |  13  |}        |\r\n  |10 | Yellow Tankard Pudding              |    48   |  12  |}        |\r\n  |   | Came up                            =|    68   |      |         |\r\n  |   | Failed                             =|    32   |      |         |\r\n  +---+-------------------------------------+---------+------+---------+\r\n\r\nEight samples of swedes from the same source are in the next table\r\nassociated with a sample of Skirving’s swede, grown in our own garden\r\n(8), of the following table, and another of turnip (9), grown on a\r\nneighbouring farm. We may remark upon the last-named sample, that we had\r\nobserved the growth of this seed, which was from a very poor crop, half\r\nof which had decayed on the ground with the early frost of 1860, and the\r\nrest, without transplanting or selection of any kind, was allowed to\r\nseed. Now, as this whole crop was so degenerated that it ought never to\r\nhave been seeded at all, we were anxious to get some of the seed from\r\nthe bulk, in order to test from its growth this year whether it will not\r\nbring forth a degenerate progeny. Its germinating qualities will be seen\r\nfrom the table, and yet it is by no means the worst sample, which seems\r\nto show that the others are not naturally bad, but so by mixture.\r\n\r\nTABLE 3.—_Germination of Swedes, &c., from Market Samples, &c._\r\n\r\n  +---+-------------------------------------+---------+------+---------+\r\n  |   |                                     | Came up |No. of|         |\r\n  |No.|           Copy of Label.            |per cent.| Days.|         |\r\n  +---+-------------------------------------+---------+------+---------+\r\n  | 1 | Ashcroft’s improved Purple Top      |    58   |  12  |}        |\r\n  | 2 | New Bangholm                        |    96   |  10  |}        |\r\n  | 3 | Skirving’s Liverpool                |    62   |  16  |}        |\r\n  | 4 | Green Top                           |    78   |  10  |}Taken   |\r\n  | 5 | Marshall’s improved Purple Top      |    90   |  10  |}from the|\r\n  | 6 | Hewer’s Improved White              |    68   |  17  |}bags by |\r\n  | 7 | Green Major                         |    86   |  10  |}the     |\r\n  | 8 | Skirving’s Swede (own grown)        |    96   |  10  |}Author. |\r\n  | 9 | Green Top Turnip, neighbour’s farm  |    78   |   6  |}        |\r\n  |10 | Fosterton Hybrid Turnip             |    64   |  10  |}        |\r\n  |   | Came up                            =|    77·6 |      |         |\r\n  |   | Failed                             =|    22·4 |      |         |\r\n  |   | Failed of seedsman’s specimens     =|    24·8 |      |         |\r\n  +---+-------------------------------------+---------+------+---------+\r\n\r\nNow, as “0 0 0” seed is supplied to customers under the designation here\r\ngiven, for the purpose of mixing, it is of little consequence whether it\r\nbe used by the wholesale house or the retail dealer; if, however, it be\r\nemployed by both, we should, indeed, get a bad sample.\r\n\r\nAs regards the seedsman’s samples in the Tables 2 and 3, we are quite\r\nunable to give exact details of their history, but we have reason to\r\nbelieve that the stock whence they were taken was purchased in the\r\nordinary course of business from different “wholesale houses,” as,\r\nthough the tradesman whence the samples came combines the business of\r\n“nurseryman” with that of seedsman, we happen to know that he is not a\r\ngrower of seeds, at least of turnip seeds. The average, then, of\r\neighteen samples of turnips and swedes from this source is that 28 _per\r\ncent._ are non-germinating seeds. The next samples are from people in a\r\nlarge way of business, who are not mere retailers, but to whom we must\r\naccord all the immunities of the trade as seed-growers, wholesale and\r\nretail seed-merchants, &c.\r\n\r\nBefore giving the tables with the results as regards these samples, it\r\nis necessary to state that they were not sent to us direct, but were\r\nforwarded through a farmer to whom they were sent in the ordinary small\r\npacket samples.\r\n\r\nWe would further remark, that as all that would germinate took so few\r\ndays about it, being an average of six days, whilst those of Table 1,\r\nbeing seeds partly of 1859 and partly of 1860, occupied nine days, and\r\nthose of Table 2, whose date we do not know, eleven days; in all\r\nprobability the seeds in question were tolerably new, most probably of\r\nthe last seed season.\r\n\r\nTABLE 4.—_Germination of Ten Samples of Turnips._\r\n\r\n  +---+-------------------------------------+---------+------+---------+\r\n  |   |                                     | Came up |No. of|         |\r\n  |No.|           Copy of Label.            |per cent.| Days.|         |\r\n  +---+-------------------------------------+---------+------+---------+\r\n  | 1 | Green Globe                         |    62   |   8  |}        |\r\n  | 2 | Dale’s Hybrid                       |    84   |   4  |}        |\r\n  | 3 | Red Globe                           |    90   |   6  |}Turnips |\r\n  | 4 | Orange Jelly                        |   100   |   4  |}from    |\r\n  | 5 | White round, or Norfolk             |    42   |   5  |}sample  |\r\n  | 6 | Green Tankard                       |    50   |   6  |}papers  |\r\n  | 7 | Scarisbrick (_sic_)                 |    88   |  11  |}communi-|\r\n  | 8 | White Globe                         |    74   |   4  |}cated.  |\r\n  | 9 | Golden Yellow                       |    82   |   4  |}        |\r\n  |10 | Green round                         |    30   |   6  |}        |\r\n  |   | Came up                            =|    70·2 |      |         |\r\n  |   | Failed                             =|    29·8 |      |         |\r\n  +---+-------------------------------------+---------+------+---------+\r\n\r\nThe specimens in next table were obtained in like manner as those of\r\nTable 4.\r\n\r\nTABLE 5.—_Germination of Samples of Common and Swede Turnips._\r\n\r\n  +---+-------------------------------------+---------+------+---------+\r\n  |   |                                     | Came up |No. of|         |\r\n  |No.|       Name.

This is of importance, as showing what genuine\r\nseed may be, the latter being doubtless as unmixed as the former was\r\nmixed.\r\n\r\nNow as regards the charge of mixing, we are not going to make it without\r\nsome evidence. In looking over the tables we have now given, it will be\r\nseen that genuine seed has but a small per-centage of non-germinating\r\nseeds—say from 5 to 10 per cent.; but not only the examples herein\r\nreferred to, with hosts of separate ones which have fallen under our\r\nnotice, show a general amount of dead seeds, of from 20 to 30 per cent.\r\nFor these figures compare Table 1 with Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5. In those\r\nof the first lot the samples were sent direct to us from a seedsman, and\r\ntheir behaviour shows us clearly enough that good seeds are to be\r\nobtained, but the other tables are as clear that from _some_ seedsmen,\r\nat any rate, though inferior samples, they are as good as are actually\r\nsold.\r\n\r\nThat seeds are mixed we have, then, good internal evidence; but we are\r\nalso in possession of facts more conclusive upon this important point,\r\nand we shall in this next chapter endeavour to enlighten our readers as\r\nto the art and mystery (especially) of turnip-seed adulteration.\r\n\r\nConfining our present remarks to turnip seeds, we assert that if farmers\r\nwill try the germinating powers from the _bulk_ of the seed which may be\r\nsent to them, they will find pretty nearly one-third to be rubbish. It\r\nis of no use to try from samples, except in comparison with bulk; and if\r\nall the farmers of Great Britain did this, and would communicate the\r\nresults, what an extraordinary tale would be unfolded, more especially\r\nif the evidence be completed by notes on the purity or otherwise of the\r\ncrop grown from such seeds!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nON THE ART AND MYSTERY OF TURNIP-SEED ADULTERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that turnip-seed is largely adulterated; it\r\nremains now to point out the nature of the admixtures, which may be\r\nsummed up under the following heads:—\r\n\r\n     1st. Old seeds are mixed with new.\r\n\r\n     2nd. Charlock, “Indian rape,” and other seeds of the _Brassicaceæ_,\r\n     are mixed with genuine seed.\r\n\r\n1st.—The crops of seeds vary so much in their produce per acre, in one\r\nyear, as compared with another, that in most years there is a\r\nsuperabundance of some kinds and a scarcity of others.\r\n\r\nNow, as most seeds are of comparatively little use except for sowing,\r\nthe surplus stock can only be disposed of at extremely low prices.\r\nAccordingly some wholesale seedsmen buy large quantities in the “glut\r\nseason,” as it is termed, and store them until the same articles fail in\r\ncrop. For instance, swede and turnip seeds, 1857 crop, could be bought\r\neverywhere at from 15 to 20 shillings per bushel; but owing to the\r\ndestruction of the roots in the winter of 1859, seedsmen in 1860 had to\r\npay the growers 50s. per bushel. Now, in 1860 there were wholesale\r\nhouses selling those seeds which they had by them for the same price.\r\nSuch people can, it is true, warrant their seeds to be genuine, as they\r\nwell know how much turnip-seeds deteriorate by keeping; the mixing of\r\nthis with good seed is still a species of adulteration; and if not mixed\r\nat all, we can then only say that the evil is so much the greater.\r\n\r\nAs an evidence of the amount of deterioration caused to turnip-seeds by\r\nkeeping, we here re-produce the table of trials of ten sorts of good\r\nseeds made in September, 1860, in contrast with experiments from the\r\nsame sample, in the same month of the present year (1862), premising\r\nthat the samples were kept in what we should consider a dry but not too\r\nwarm a temperature.\r\n\r\nTABLE 6.—_Germination of Ten Sorts of Turnips._\r\n\r\n  +---+-------------------------------------+--------+--------+\r\n  |   |                                     |Came up |Came up |\r\n  |No.|       Name.

Such is the great difference\r\nbetween two and three year old seeds.\r\n\r\n2nd.—Even the above _genuine seeds_ (!) are not unfrequently mixed, and\r\nwe may now examine the nature of some of these mixtures. Charlock and\r\nIndian rape are all _prepared_ for this purpose: that is to say, they\r\nare rendered incapable of germinating before mixture—“Dead men tell no\r\ntales.” Now rubbish, so prepared, is well known in the trade as 000\r\nseed. Under this denomination all seedsmen know it, and it can be\r\nprocured by the trade at about 7s. per bushel.\r\n\r\nWith respect to this 000 seed, we direct attention to the following\r\nletter addressed to a most respectable firm.\r\n\r\n     SOUTHAMPTON, _April 27, 1860_.\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN,—Being in possession of a new and improved method of\r\n     killing seeds without the use of any chemicals, so that the seed\r\n     when in a 000 state has not that unpleasant smell it has when\r\n     killed by the old method, and does not look perished if it be\r\n     crushed. A man by the new process may kill ten or twelve quarters\r\n     per day, and the apparatus is so constructed that it is impossible\r\n     for a single seed to leave it alive; and one great advantage is,\r\n     that if you want a sack of 000 seed in a hurry you may kill a sack\r\n     of rape or turnip, or any seed, and have it fit for use in an hour.\r\n     Seed in the process of killing increases in measure and weight, and\r\n     when you send it out to be killed, of course, the seed-killers keep\r\n     the extra weight and measure. If you think it worth your attention,\r\n     I will send you a small working model, so that you may kill a few\r\n     pounds of kale or cauliflower, or any small seeds in a few minutes,\r\n     and instructions for making a large one on receipt of a Post-office\r\n     order for £2.\r\n\r\n     Yours truly,\r\n\r\n     ——\r\n\r\nTo this the Messrs. Sutton append the following remarks:—\r\n\r\n     The writer of the above being unknown to us, we had the curiosity\r\n     to call at the address given, and ascertained that it was no\r\n     “hoax,” but was assured by the “inventor” that he had supplied\r\n     several tradesmen with the apparatus, and that he was _formerly_ in\r\n     the seed trade himself. We may add, that we have since heard from\r\n     the same individual at another sea-port town to which he has\r\n     removed.\r\n\r\nHaving got possession of this circular, and being desirous of becoming\r\nacquainted with so notable an invention, we lost no time in setting on\r\nfoot a negotiation for the possession of the secret, and having traced\r\nthe inventor in his removal from Southampton to Gosport, we then had\r\nletters addressed to him upon the subject, and, if promises had been of\r\nany avail, we might possibly at this time have been in possession of a\r\nvery improved and expeditious method of making 000 seeds, only that we\r\nhave learnt the undesirable nature of pay beforehand.\r\n\r\nOur next inquiry was for a sample of 000 seed itself; but, although it\r\nis well known in the trade, we have hitherto failed in procuring it. We\r\nhad hoped that our seedsmen might have been able to procure some through\r\nsome of their friends. The result was, that we made application to a\r\nmost respectable London firm, receiving the following reply:—\r\n\r\n     LONDON, _February 27, 1861_.\r\n\r\n     SIR,—In reply to your favour received this morning, we take leave\r\n     to say that we shall have pleasure in complying with your request\r\n     for a sample of 000 turnips, if we can obtain it. But we do not\r\n     keep it ourselves, nor do we know the parties who prepare it, it\r\n     being something of a trade secret. We will, however, apply to some\r\n     of our friends here to let us have a small quantity, but doubt if\r\n     they will let us have it, as it is a matter they are rather chary\r\n     respecting, and _although perfectly well known and understood in\r\n     the trade, they do not care to have it known beyond_, and our\r\n     asking for a small quantity will be sure to lead to the question,\r\n     “What do we want it for?” We could obtain a large quantity without\r\n     hesitation.\r\n\r\n     We remain, &c.,\r\n\r\n     ——\r\n\r\nThe sentence we have placed in italics will be quite sufficient to show\r\nhow well the matter of 000 seeds is understood in the trade, and how\r\neasy it is to get bushels of it, no questions being asked, while a small\r\nquantity, required only for investigation, may be refused.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that the machinery exists by which any one in the seed\r\ntrade may quietly and easily commit enormous frauds. And it is plain\r\nthat the very notoriety of this machinery, together with the condition\r\nof many of the samples of seed which we have examined (see Chap. VI.)\r\nprove that this machinery actually is employed by many seedsmen to the\r\ngreat injury of their customers.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, then, be doing wrong in urging any one to make trial of the\r\nseeds he is about to buy before he sows them, or even before he\r\npurchases them. Where the experience of a number of years already\r\nexists, the character of the seedsman is a guarantee for the good\r\nquality of his goods, and experience of this kind is indeed a more\r\nperfect carrying out of the system of preliminary trial or experiment,\r\nwhich we recommend especially to all new customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nON THE INJURIES CAUSED BY INSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoot-crops are especially liable to injury from the depredations of\r\ninsects. Thus the turnip may have its seed more or less destroyed by\r\nweevils. Immediately the seed appears above the ground, commences the\r\nattack by the turnip flea-beetles. The bulb is pierced by beetles,\r\nending in those excrescences called “turnip-warbles;” and there is\r\nreason to think that even the root-fibrils are in some soils made the\r\ndepositories of the eggs of insects, which give rise to extraordinary\r\nmalformations.\r\n\r\nCarrots and parsnips are liable to have the best-grown root made useless\r\nby its being pierced and eaten by the larvæ or grubs of a small fly,\r\nknown as the _Psila rosæ_.\r\n\r\nEven the mangel-wurzel, which has been so strenuously recommended as a\r\nsubstitute for the turnip on account of its freedom from insect attacks,\r\nand connected with which Curtis only describes a single insect, a\r\nleaf-miner, called _Anthomyia Betæ_, upon which he remarks that “these\r\ninsects will seldom cause any loss to the mangel-wurzel crops should\r\nthey ever abound to any extent.” In spite, however, of this, we find\r\nthat the increased growth of this crop has caused a corresponding\r\nincrease in the insect, to such an extent that, during the last two\r\nseasons, many crops have entirely failed from its depredations; as\r\nwitness the following communication to the _Agricultural Gazette_ for\r\nAugust 23rd, 1862:—\r\n\r\n     My mangel crop was drilled the 17th May, and came up most\r\n     favourably. On Monday, the 2nd June, I asked my bailiff what was\r\n     the matter with it; he said, “Oh, it was a sharp frost last night;”\r\n     but on examination I found that instead of frost the leaves had\r\n     within them a maggot, which had caused the plant to brown and die\r\n     off. The late rains and growing weather have enabled the plant\r\n     somewhat to revive, and also fresh plants to come up (for I had\r\n     drilled 7 lb. per acre), but found to-day several leaves with\r\n     maggots in them. My man told me “a quantity had eaten themselves\r\n     out of the leaf and dropped;” and that he saw “a vast number of\r\n     sparrows picking up those maggots.” I send you herewith some plants\r\n     I brought up from the farm. My idea is that the seed was damp and\r\n     bred the maggots, or that the leaves had been “struck with a fly,”\r\n     and then the maggot followed. You will please let me have your\r\n     ideas upon these points.—S. S.\r\n\r\nThe maggot, or larvæ, here described is that of a fly called the\r\n_Anthomyia (Pegomyia) betæ_, mangel-wurzel fly. An allied species will\r\nsometimes be found on the common dock-leaves, mining their galleries\r\nbetween the dermal cells of the leaves.\r\n\r\nWe have for some time observed the increase of this pest, and we are\r\nprepared to state that now we seldom see a crop that is not greatly\r\ninjured by its attacks. Mr. Curtis thinks that the best method to\r\ndestroy them is to employ boys to crush the leaves between the thumb and\r\nfingers at the part where the larvæ can be seen; and with this we fear\r\nwe must for the present be content, unless we could devise some means to\r\ntake the fly before its eggs are laid in the leaves.\r\n\r\nWe need not here dwell at length upon the natural history of those pests\r\nof the turnip—the _Haltica nemorum_ (striped flea-beetle), and _H.\r\nconcinna_ (black flea-beetle), as the nature of their ravages are\r\ntolerably well known. Thus much, however, may be said; namely:—\r\n\r\n     _a._ These insects are called fleas because they have the power of\r\n     hopping on being disturbed, much after the manner of a flea.\r\n\r\n     _b._ They have some five or six broods each year; the earlier ones\r\n     probably being bred on charlocks and other weeds of the same\r\n     natural order as the turnip; and hence, then, charlocks are pests,\r\n     not only as being weeds, but as breeding-places for one of our most\r\n     mischievous insects.\r\n\r\n     _c._ They migrate from their weed-haunts to the first crop of\r\n     turnips, where much of their mischief may be prevented by simply\r\n     dusting over the young plants with any fine powder, road-dirt\r\n     answering the purpose as well as anything else.\r\n\r\nVarious devices have been employed for keeping away and killing these\r\nlittle creatures. We have used a contrivance for catching them, which\r\nmay be described as follows:—\r\n\r\nSome thin board (or boards), making a surface of about 4 feet long by 2\r\nfeet wide, is furnished at one end with a pair of light wheels of just\r\nsufficient diameter to lift the board about 2 or 3 inches above the\r\nplants. To the other end may be attached two crooked handles in such a\r\nmanner that the machine can be wheeled flatly over the plants, or if\r\nfour wheels be employed, one at each corner, a single handle can be used\r\neither to push or pull the implement. When used, it should have its\r\nunderside painted over with tar or any handy viscid substance.\r\n\r\nThis should be used on bright days, the operator pushing it over the\r\nrows of turnips, so as, if possible, not to throw his shadow before. The\r\nmiddle of the day will be best, not only for this reason, but also\r\nbecause these creatures feed more actively at that time.\r\n\r\nNow, our experience in the use of this simple contrivance on small\r\nexperimental plots convinces us that a small boy could easily keep under\r\nthe enemy in a good-sized field.\r\n\r\nBut now comes a very important question for consideration. Cannot we do\r\nmore than kill a few of these creatures? cannot we adopt such plans as\r\nwill render our _crops_ tolerably safe from their depredations? We think\r\nso, and to this end advise the following method of proceeding:—\r\n\r\nLet each turnip-grower prepare for the enemy by sowing from the eighth\r\nto a quarter of an acre of turnips in a sunny part of the farm as early\r\nas the first week in April. These patches would quickly attract all the\r\nturnip flea-beetles from the wild _cruciferæ_ on which the first broods\r\nseem to depend, and in this small compass they can be killed in detail\r\nwith the simple contrivance just described, so that when the real crop\r\ncomes up there will be none, or at least only a few, beetles to emigrate\r\nto it; whereas, as we now manage, by the time the crop of turnips is\r\nsown, enough of the creatures are too often bred to render it necessary\r\nto sow two or three times before we can secure a crop.\r\n\r\n_Anbury_ is an affection to which only the different sorts of turnips\r\nare liable, in which case it differs from finger-and-toe, with which it\r\nhas been very much confounded, as this latter occurs in all kinds of\r\nroots; namely, turnips, carrots, mangel-wurzel, &c., as well as both the\r\ncommon and Swedish turnips.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 11_ (Fig. 8 repeated). Finger-and-toe Carrot. Half\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\nAs a sample of an extreme case of finger-and-toe—_digitate_ root,—we\r\nrepeat the following figure of a Belgian carrot, in which it will be\r\nseen that the forks gradually taper to the extremities; in fact, the\r\nwhole, instead of being a succulent fleshy tap or _fusiform_ root, in\r\nwhich case it could readily be stored, is divided in fingers-and-toes,\r\nwhich are liable to break off, and this renders the product next to\r\nuseless. Now, this affection may occur in any soil, as it is the result\r\nof a degeneracy in the stock of the plant; but in the affection now to\r\nbe described the case is wholly different, as here the bulk of the swede\r\n(fig. 12) is affected with rough, cancerous knobs, whilst the rootlets\r\nsupport irregular knobs of a like kind, which have more the aspect of\r\nsuspended rows of ginger than fingers-and-toes.\r\n\r\nRoots so affected soon rot, and have a fœtid odour, so that they are not\r\nonly useless themselves, but communicate canker and decay to the whole\r\nstore. In the putrid mass will be found maggots and flies and beetles of\r\ndifferent kinds; but as yet naturalists are not agreed as to whether the\r\nnodules of disease are caused by insects, or whether these creatures are\r\nmerely attracted by the fœtid matter. We are, however, inclined to the\r\nbelief that some insects are connected with the diseased appearance in\r\nthe first place, whilst others afterwards step in to fatten upon the\r\ndecaying matter, induced by the first lot; but still it must be\r\nconfessed that the subject requires much more attention than it has yet\r\nreceived, in order to settle these important questions.\r\n\r\nStill it may be observed that one point has been universally admitted;\r\nnamely, that anbury only occurs to any extent in sandy soils, where\r\nthere is an absence of lime, a good dressing of which mineral is the\r\nbest safeguard against this affection. Still, in soils that are liable\r\nto anbury, we should not recommend the continuance of turnip-growing, or\r\nat least not so frequently in the rotation as has hitherto been the\r\ncase, and more especially as the soils which produce anbury to the\r\ngreatest extent are just those best adapted for parsnips and carrots,\r\nwhich, if not wholly, may occasionally be very profitably grown in the\r\nplace of the turnip.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 12._ Swede affected with Anbury. Nat. size.]\r\n\r\nHaving given a few notes on the more prominent forms of insect attacks\r\nto which root crops are liable, we would now close this chapter, as\r\ndetails of all the insect pests would occupy more space than we can here\r\nallot to the subject; but to those who would inquire further upon this\r\nfertile theme, we would advise the perusal of “Farm Insects,” by J.\r\nCurtis, Esq., F.L.S., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\nTo render our subject as complete as possible, we direct attention to\r\nthe following practical conclusions, to which our whole argument upon\r\nthe science of root-growing points:—\r\n\r\n     First.—Cultivated roots are improved wild ones, only to be obtained\r\n     by gardening on the small, or farming on the large scale; this\r\n     gardening or farming being carried on by certain operations at\r\n     certain seasons which we have comprehended under the term of\r\n     cultivation processes.\r\n\r\n     Second.—The difference in sort of roots is caused either by\r\n     cross-breeding as the result of accident or design, or of the\r\n     education of some particular propensity which has been acted upon\r\n     by the intelligent seed-grower.\r\n\r\n     Third.—The maintenance of sorts in purity depends upon careful\r\n     selection of the right variety for the seeding examples.\r\n\r\n     Fourth.—The preservation of a good outline or shape of root can\r\n     only be maintained by selecting those of good _form_ to seed from;\r\n     for, as running to seed, multiform top, forkiness, “finger-and-toe”\r\n     in roots, is evidence of wild growth, so, then, cultivated plants\r\n     assuming this form are considered as degenerate, and seed from such\r\n     roots produces a malformed and poor crop.\r\n\r\n     Fifth.—The difficulties of getting good seed—whether of trueness to\r\n     sort, from carefully selected bulbs, or free from adulteration\r\n     either of old with new seed, or a mixture of charlock and others of\r\n     the same family—are very great. Where, however, good seed can be\r\n     depended upon, it is much cheaper, though at a considerable\r\n     increase of first seeds cost, as not only quality but the quantity\r\n     of live so considerably depends upon the truth and honesty of the\r\n     seedsman.\r\n\r\n     Sixth.—Injuries from insect attacks, though serious as affecting\r\n     the yield, are yet not due to the seed; and anbury, if it be due to\r\n     insects, only occurs in the turnip-crops, and then in particular\r\n     soils. The true insect attacks to be averted by simultaneous\r\n     action.\r\n\r\n     In fine.—_Good seed, of a true sort,—care in growth,—and a\r\n     watchfulness of enemies, includes the_ SCIENCE _and_ PRACTICE _of\r\n     Root Cultivation._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FURNISH YOUR HOUSE WITH THE BEST ARTICLES AT\r\n\r\nDEANE’S\r\n\r\nA.D 1700\r\n\r\nGENERAL FURNISHING IRONMONGERY WAREHOUSE\r\n\r\nAN ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUE POST FREE ON APPLICATION\r\n\r\nLONDON BRIDGE\r\n\r\nDEANE & C^o.

There is at the present day a\r\n     numerous and increasing class of intelligent readers who, without\r\n     being scientific, are nevertheless greatly interested in scientific\r\n     progress. They would willingly become acquainted with scientific\r\n     truths, but are too often deterred from the pursuit of such studies\r\n     by the abstruse or technical language in which these truths are\r\n     conveyed. In order to meet the requirements of this portion of the\r\n     community, every available means has been adopted to procure the\r\n     most accurate information on all subjects of which the journal\r\n     treats. No pains or expense has been spared to secure the most\r\n     skilful artists to illustrate its pages.\r\n\r\n     Each number contains systematic, instructive articles (illustrated\r\n     when needful) on subjects connected with some of the following\r\n     sciences, viz.:—\r\n\r\n  ASTRONOMY,    |  GEOGRAPHY,     |  MINERALOGY,\r\n  BOTANY,       |  GEOLOGY,       |  PHYSICS,\r\n  CHEMISTRY,    |  METALLURGY,    |  ZOOLOGY,\r\n  ETHNOLOGY,    |  MICROSCOPY,    |  &c. &c., and\r\n\r\n     SCIENCE applied to the Arts, Manufactures, Commerce, and\r\n     Agriculture.\r\n\r\n     LIST OF CONTRIBUTORS.\r\n\r\n  ANDREWS, W., M.R.I.A.

Viewed in this\r\nway, original pasture is not so extensive as may be supposed; indeed,\r\nthere is scarcely such a thing at all, as all pastures are the result of\r\nsomething like cultivation,—as, left to themselves, that is, to Nature,\r\nthey would soon resume the aspect of jungle, moor, or marsh, according\r\nto soil and situation.\r\n\r\nMeadows and pastures may, then, for our present purpose, be conveniently\r\ntabulated as follows:—\r\n\r\nA. PERMANENT PASTURES.\r\n\r\n     1. _Moors and uplands_, unenclosed or but partially fenced in.\r\n\r\n     2. _Commons_, unenclosed land, usually about villages, conferring\r\n     the right of cattle and goose grazing.\r\n\r\n     3. _River flats_ and lowlands, liable to floods.\r\n\r\n     4. _Irrigated Meadow_, in which the water is controllable.\r\n\r\n     5. _Meadows_, or permanent grass enclosures.\r\n\r\nB. ARTIFICIAL PASTURES.\r\n\r\n     6. _Seeds_, shifting crops of some grasses, clovers, saintfoin,\r\n     &c., used either mixed or separately.\r\n\r\n1. Moors, uplands, and downs (such as Dartmoor and Salisbury Plain) are\r\nmore or less wild according to their elevation and the geological\r\nformation on which they occur. They consist of large tracts of land\r\neither without fences at all, or only those of the most inefficient\r\nkind, rather boundary-lines than otherwise. They are never used for\r\nhaymaking, nor are they cultivated beyond depasturing. These are dotted\r\nwith patches of rough grass, thorns, briers, and shrubs or stunted\r\ntrees where the surface is much broken, and the animals they are made to\r\ncarry are few; but on the more rounded and smooth lines of the downs is\r\na finer herbage, kept so not only from the nature of the case, but from\r\nthe fact that such a position favours the more thickly stocking it with\r\nthat close-grazing animal the sheep.\r\n\r\nThese pasturages, though very extensive, are yet being encroached upon\r\nby a higher cultivation, and the hayfields one occasionally meets with\r\naround the squatter’s cabin even in the wild mountainous parts of Wales\r\nsufficiently testify to the greater productiveness of which the most\r\nunfavourable districts are capable.\r\n\r\n2. The village common is sometimes extensive; it, too, as the former, is\r\nonly grazed. Many of them have of late years been enclosed. Where much\r\ndepastured—and they usually carry as much stock as they can bear—there\r\nis a remarkable absence of plants other than grasses. Indeed,\r\ngrass-herbage, and usually of the best species, will prevail, unless in\r\nplaces where there may be stagnant water, in which cases a little\r\ndrainage would produce a large public benefit; but as what is\r\neverybody’s business is done by no one, the common is too often left\r\nmuch wilder, and thus made poorer than it need be.\r\n\r\n3. The river flats here meant are, for the most part, large fields\r\npartaking of the nature of common; that is, certain farmers and others\r\nhave the privilege of grazing during the autumn; but it is _aimed up_\r\nearly in spring, for the purpose of taking a crop of hay. Such lands\r\nwould be impoverished by such constant haymaking; but the winter floods\r\nleave behind them a deposit of silt and fluviatile materials, and\r\nperhaps beside act as a solvent; so that their fertility is wonderfully\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nMany such wide stretches of meadow occur on the banks of the Severn, as\r\nin the neighbourhood of Gloucester, Tewkesbury, Worcester, &c., where\r\nthey get the name of _Ham_. It is much to be regretted that these hams\r\nare not made the most of, for the same reason as applies with respect to\r\ncommon, for the want of some efficient officer to direct improvements;\r\nand so from the water here and there stagnating good herbage is ruined,\r\nand from the floods not being controllable, even hay is lost with the\r\nsummer freshets. But where such land is vested in single enterprising\r\nproprietors, not only is drainage insured, but embankments are made to\r\nkeep out the waters when not required, as so much met with on the banks\r\nof the Thames; and such fields are at once an evidence of the\r\ncapabilities of river flats, and the great importance of individual\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n4. The last case approaches very nearly to that of _irrigated_ meadows;\r\nbut these latter are mostly situate on small streams, which can be\r\ndirected to flow through, not over them, at any time: they offer a most\r\nimportant means of augmenting our pasturage in certain districts, and\r\nwill therefore receive a chapter to themselves.\r\n\r\n5. Permanent grass enclosures are of very varied sizes, from hundreds of\r\nacres, forming perhaps a park, to the small meadow of the homestead;\r\nthey may be seldom or never used for haymaking, but most of them are\r\naimed up for hay once, twice, or thrice in four or five years. These\r\nform the greater part of the grass-lands of our country, and are indeed\r\nnowhere greener or more productive than in the British Isles; still, as\r\nwe are an advocate for their cultivation—which, if it does not quite\r\nrealize the position of making two blades of grass grow where one grew\r\nbefore, may at least do much in this direction—we shall reserve further\r\nremarks upon this subject until we have particularly analyzed the\r\ncontents of a meadow.\r\n\r\n6. As shifting crops, grasses, and other fodder plants may be made\r\nexceedingly useful, these may therefore well occupy a chapter to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nON THE SPECIES OF MEADOW-GRASSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we possess more than a hundred species of native grasses, we\r\nshall rarely find a fourth of them even in a wide range of meadows; and\r\nif we do so, it is rather an argument against than in favour of the\r\nquality of their herbage, as, so few are the best grasses in number,\r\nthat it is almost a law for the best meadows to contain the fewest\r\nspecies of true grasses.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the good grasses be so few, whatever is not of these must be\r\ninferior, and, indeed, so bad are some grasses that they can only be\r\nconsidered as weeds. These weed-like forms are known to the farmer from\r\nhis observing that the cattle usually refuse to eat them, and hence he\r\nhas got to call them “sour grasses,”—a term which, though perhaps meant\r\nto convey the idea that such are objectionable in flavour, yet it is\r\noftener that they are refused from their want of flavour, or from some\r\nmechanical objection arising from their roughness of growth, some having\r\nsharp serrated cutting edges to their leaves, whilst the spicular awns,\r\nso conspicuous in the beard of barley, cause great irritation by\r\nsticking beneath the tongue and in the gums. Of these, the first are\r\nobjectionable for pasture, the last for hay, and should, therefore, not\r\nbe found in really good meadows.\r\n\r\nThe figures and descriptions which follow are given in illustration of\r\nsome of the more usual meadow species, which, though not fully or\r\nbotanically described, will yet aid the practical farmer in estimating\r\nthe species, and their value and significance, which he will commonly\r\nfind in his fields.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 13._ The Meadow Foxtail.]\r\n\r\nThe Meadow Foxtail (_Alopecurus pratensis_, fig. 13) is an early species\r\nof the _spicate_ form—_i.e._, the flowers grow close together, into a\r\nmore or less dense head. It yields a great quantity of herbage,\r\nespecially in moist situations; and is particularly adapted for the\r\nirrigated meadow. It should be distinguished from the _A. geniculatus_\r\n(Kneeling Foxtail), whose spike is only about half the length and size,\r\nas this is particularly a water species, so that if found when a meadow\r\nis dry, it is yet an evidence that water must have lain where it occurs\r\nfor a considerable period of the year. Also from the _A. agrestis_\r\n(Slender Foxtail), which has a longer and thinner spike, as this latter\r\nis a weed in poor hungry clays, which is useless except as serving to\r\nindicate that the land wants perhaps both drainage and manure. Here,\r\nthen, our first genus presents us with species indicating the varied\r\nconditions of rich meadow, wet places, and poor arable; and it is this\r\nvariableness in adaptability that makes the grasses such important\r\nindicators of the nature and condition of soils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 14._ The Catstail Grass.]\r\n\r\nThe Catstail Grass (_Phleum pratense_, fig. 14) in general form is not\r\nunlike the preceding, but it is much rougher in all its parts, and is\r\none of the latest instead of one of our earliest species. Its name of\r\ncatstail is due to its rough flowers, an enlarged drawing of one of\r\nwhich is given at _a_. It has also got the name of Timothy Grass, from\r\none Mr. Timothy Hanson, an American, to whom, probably, is owing its\r\nfirst introduction as a “self-crop,” large fields of this useful\r\nspecies, mostly by itself, being grown in Canada and the States as a\r\nfodder plant. It is very useful in the meadow, as supplying a late crop\r\nof stems and leaves; greatly augmenting the amount of herbage in some of\r\nthe colder though not poor districts.\r\n\r\nWe have never seen this grass used as a self-crop in England, but we are\r\nconvinced that on some of the rich alluvial flats, as in the lands\r\nreclaimed from the Severn, and warp soils in general, it would yield a\r\nlarge bulk of good feeding matter, which, though somewhat rough, would\r\nyet mix well with clovers, &c., in chaff-cutting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 15._ The Sweet Vernal Grass.]\r\n\r\nThe Sweet Vernal Grass (_Anthoxanthum odoratum_, fig. 15) is a very\r\nearly species, with a somewhat lax spike of flowers, which usually\r\nbecome of a bright straw-colour by the time the hayfield is ripe for the\r\nscythe. It does not yield much bulk, but its grateful bitter when fresh,\r\nand the peculiarly sweet hayfield odour which it yields on drying, would\r\nseem to make this grass of importance, from the flavour which it imparts\r\nto the produce of the field; indeed so much so, that much of the value\r\nof natural meadow hay over that of artificial pasture may be traced to\r\nthe presence of this grass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 16._ The Crested Dogstail.]\r\n\r\nThe Crested Dogstail (_Cynosurus cristatus_, fig. 16) has its florets\r\narranged in front of a series of abortive branches, as represented at\r\n_a_, enlarged. It has a very slender stem, which is hard and wiry when\r\nripe—a condition which it so universally attains, even in spite of\r\nconstant depasturing, that we never recommend its use in mixtures for\r\npermanent pasture, as its stems are particularly innutritious, and its\r\nherbage is so small as to be of little value. It never prevails much in\r\nour best pastures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 17._ Rye Grass, or Ray Grass.]\r\n\r\nRye Grass, or Ray Grass (_Lolium perenne_, fig. 17), has no connection\r\nwith the Cereal Rye. It is one of our commonest and most useful species,\r\nboth as a plant for the natural meadow or for arable culture, especially\r\nin mixture with clovers, which has the name of “seeds.” It yields good\r\nbulk for the rick, and will so readily grow after cutting or close\r\ndepasturing that it commonly affords the greater part of the herbage of\r\na pasture. From being so valuable, its seed has been much cultivated;\r\nand as it has a tendency to form more or less permanent varieties, so we\r\nfind in the market several different sorts; as “Pacey’s, Ruck’s,\r\nRussell’s, Stickney’s, Rye Grass,” &c. It should always form part in any\r\nmixture in laying down permanent pasture, in which case it should be\r\ndistinguished from the _Lolium Italicum_, the florets and seeds of\r\nwhich are awned-pointed, as at _a_. This latter is useful as an annual\r\nself-crop, but seedsmen too often mix it in permanent-pasture\r\ncollections, for the reason that it grows faster, and so makes a show\r\nthe first year, and so satisfies the customer; but it soon dies out,\r\nwhile its large growth has kept under the more enduring forms. _b_\r\nrepresents a bunch of the tumid flowers of the _Lolium temulentum_\r\n(Drunken Darnel), once a pest in cornfields, but now, fortunately, of\r\nrare occurrence, if we are to believe the tales told of its so-called\r\npoisonous seeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 18._ The Cocksfoot.]\r\n\r\nThe Cocksfoot (_Dactylis glomerata_, fig. 18), though a large and\r\nsomewhat coarse grass, is by no means inferior in quality, its hay being\r\nhighly nutritious, whilst its cut or cropped herbage is so quick of\r\ngrowth that it is capable of yielding a great deal of keep. It sends its\r\nroot deep into the soil, so that it can grow well in poor land if dry;\r\nbut it never flourishes in very wet situations. It is constant in good\r\nmeadows, unless when they are always depastured, as there the constant\r\ntreading greatly interferes with it: it is, therefore, by no means so\r\nabundant in sheep pastures; whence has arisen the idea with some farmers\r\nthat “too much sheep-grazing wears out the richer grasses.”\r\n\r\nWe should always recommend cocksfoot as a part of mixtures for permanent\r\npasture, taking care to well roll the meadow once or twice a year—a\r\nprocess of great importance—to keep the turf in an even pile, and so\r\nprevent that growing of large clusters or hassocks of one sort, a method\r\nof growth to which the cocksfoot is somewhat prone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 19._ The Rough-stalked Meadow Grass.]\r\n\r\nThe Rough-stalked Meadow Grass (_Poa trivialis_, fig. 19) is a common\r\nspecies in moist meadows, where it often forms a considerable portion of\r\nthe herbage: it is distinguished from the smooth-stalked by the\r\nlong-pointed tongue (_ligule_) to the leaves (_a_), and a stem which is\r\nsomewhat rough to the feel, especially when drawn downwards through the\r\nfingers. This grass yields a quantity of herbage, but our experience\r\nleads us to conclude that it does not possess quite so good a quality as\r\nSinclair and authors who have copied from him would lead us to suppose,\r\nas we have found it wanting in feeding qualities, or what the farmer\r\ncalls “proof.” It usually forms a large part of the hay of the irrigated\r\nmeadow, which, though often large in quantity, is yet not equal to that\r\nof ordinary good meadows in feeding properties.\r\n\r\nThe Smooth-stalked Meadow Grass (_Poa pratensis_), distinguished by a\r\nblunt ligule (_b_) and smooth stem, is as abundant in dry situations as\r\nthe former is in damp ones. We confess to a great partiality for this\r\ngrass, notwithstanding that authors speak slightingly of its value; but\r\nthe truth is, that it varies with soil and situation, it being a species\r\nwhich, when growing on a wild moor, is poor in both quantity and\r\nquality. But we know of no better sign of the improvement of a bad\r\nmeadow than the increase of this grass, and its putting on, as it will\r\ndo under such circumstances, of its richest green tint.\r\n\r\n_Poa nemoralis_ (Wood Meadow Grass) is a more slender form, whose wild\r\n_habitat_ is in woods and shady places, especially on calcareous soils.\r\nThis points it out as a useful grass for wood-glades and positions\r\nbeneath trees, in which it may very properly be employed.\r\n\r\nIn laying down permanent pastures we should, then, employ these three\r\npoas as follows:—\r\n\r\n     _Poa trivialis_, for low, damp situations and irrigated meadows.\r\n\r\n     _Poa pratensis_, for sound dry pastures and uplands.\r\n\r\n     _Poa nemoralis_, for rides between woods, wood-glades, and shady\r\n     places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 20._ Meadow Fescue.]\r\n\r\nMeadow Fescue (_Festuca pratensis_, fig. 20) may be taken as the type of\r\nthe broad-leaved fescues. It is a common and good succulent grass in\r\nrich meadows, and should always be employed in seed mixtures for such\r\nsituations, A variety, botanically known as _F. loliacea_, is\r\nunbranched, like the lolium or rye grass. The position of this is on\r\nrich river flats: we have seen it on the banks of the Isis at Oxford,\r\nforming a large part of most excellent herbage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 21._ The Tall Fescue.]\r\n\r\nThe Tall Fescue (_Festuca elatior_, fig. 21) is a larger and coarser\r\nform of _F. pratensis_, as seed of the latter will become the former by\r\nbeing sown on some stiff sandy clays. It occurs abundantly on the stiff\r\nalluvial deposits of our estuaries and river flats. It is an exceedingly\r\ncoarse grass, with a tendency to grow in large separate bunches; and\r\nhence its presence is destructive to good pastures: it may, however, be\r\nencouraged as a rough growth in its indicated _habitats_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 22._ Sheep’s Fescue.]\r\n\r\nSheep’s Fescue (_Festuca ovina_, fig. 22) may be taken as the type of\r\nthe small-leaved fescues. It is a native of our downs, and forms a large\r\nproportion of the sweet down sheep-pastures. It is known by its fine\r\nleaves, which come up immediately after the closest feeding; and if its\r\nquantity equalled its quality, it would be even more valuable than it\r\nis. A larger form, the Hard Fescue (_F. duriuscula_), is common to sound\r\nmeadows and the hill valleys. This has much the same properties as the\r\nformer, but it is taller, with longer and broader leaves. This should\r\nalways be encouraged, and in laying down grass for permanent pasture, it\r\nshould be plentifully added to the seed mixture.\r\n\r\nThe Downy Wild Oat (_Avena pubescens_, fig. 23) is a common grass on\r\nthin calcareous soils. As it is very light in structure, and yields but\r\nlittle grass, it is not worth much as a first-rate pasture plant,—and\r\nindeed it would scarcely prefer to grow on them.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a smaller-flowered species, the _Avena flavescens_\r\n(Yellow Oat-grass), which is better. It, too, occurs on chalky soils;\r\nwhile the _Avena pratensis_ (Meadow Oat-grass) is found too frequently\r\nin poor clays or on starved moors, in which its rigid leaves and harsh\r\nstructure render it little, if any, better than a weed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 23._ The Downy Wild Oat.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting species of the genus is the _Avena fatua_\r\n(Wild Oat), well known as a weed in stiff arable soils. This is the\r\nparent of the crop oats in cultivation, and there is reason to know that\r\nby degeneracy the crop oat in some districts leaves behind a pest of\r\nwild oats.[2]\r\n\r\n[2] See “Natural History of British Meadow and Pasture Grasses,” by the\r\nAuthor.\r\n\r\nThe Oat-like Grass (_Arrhenatherum avenaceum_, fig. 24), though a tall,\r\nsucculent-looking species, is still too common in poor soils, as its\r\nherbage is bitter and nauseous, and not liked by cattle; and hay from it\r\nis always inferior in quality. It is sometimes recommended by seedsmen,\r\nand usually put with their mixtures; but we should at all times refuse\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 24._ The Oat-like Grass.]\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiar form of this which occasionally occurs in sandy\r\ndistricts, called _A. avenaceum_, variety _bulbosum_ (Onion Couch), the\r\ntrivial name of which has been given from the fact that its nodes\r\nthicken below the soil, and present the appearance of small races of\r\nonions. This pest is got out of the land by harrowing and hand-picking;\r\nbut as every bulb grows like joints of real couch, it is very difficult\r\nto entirely eradicate it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 25._ The Soft Brome, or Lop Grasses.]\r\n\r\nThe Soft Brome, or Lop Grasses (_Bromus mollis_, fig. 25), and its\r\ncongeners, is an annual grass, and therefore very objectionable,\r\nwhether in the meadow or in “seeds,” to both of which, when poor and\r\nneglected, it becomes attached. In both positions it is sometimes mixed\r\nwith a kind that droops pretty considerably to one side; from which it\r\nhas got the name of “lop.” From the meadow it is soon got rid of by\r\nmanuring and depasturing; haymaking, though it cuts off the main stem,\r\nonly encourages smaller ones to spring up late, and so the seed is sown.\r\nIn “seeds” it is frequently mixed with rye-grass seed, as it too often\r\noccurs that a patch of rye-grass with much lop is seeded, as the most\r\nprofitable way to deal with it, as its seeds are heavy and large, and\r\ntherefore tell well, either by weight or measure. Our enlarged drawing\r\nof a seed with its envelopes is given to contrast with rye-grass seed,\r\nwhich is narrower and more pointed.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years a species of brome grass, which was formerly\r\nvery rare, has become a common weed: we mean the _B. arvensis_, Corn\r\nBrome-grass,—a species with smaller and more numerous heads of flowers\r\nthan the one just described. This has spread with the growth of foreign\r\nseeds, and so suddenly has it appeared in some places as to cause\r\nfarmers to come to the conclusion that poor cultivation has made the\r\nland spontaneously bring forth “a nasty sort of wild oat,” while others\r\nhave even concluded that a cereal crop had been transformed into this\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\nThe _Bromus erectus_ (Upright Brome Grass) is very constant to poor\r\ncalcareous soils. This is a perennial species, but very poor indeed in\r\nfeeding qualities; however, it looks green in park-glades, and if kept\r\ndown by rough stock, it may then be made useful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 26._ The Bent Grass.]\r\n\r\nThe Bent Grass (_Agrostis stolonifera_, fig. 26) is probably only a\r\nvariety of the common marsh species, _A. alba_. Under the name of Fiorin\r\nGrass, this plant has been much extolled for the meadow; but our\r\nexperience shows it to vary in value according to the nature of the\r\nposition in which it is placed: as thus, in an irrigated meadow it sends\r\nup a large quantity of quite rich pasturage, whilst in poor or dry\r\ndistricts its herbage is hard and harsh, and not at all relished by\r\ncattle or sheep.\r\n\r\nThe form we have figured is more particularly agrarian where its\r\ncreeping underground stem forms a kind of mischievous couch, and this,\r\nunited with a tangled growth derived from shoots rooting above the\r\nground, renders this one of the most pernicious weeds, especially in\r\nthin soils, on calcareous, brashy, or stony soils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 27._ Woolly Soft Grass.]\r\n\r\nWoolly Soft Grass (_Holcus lanatus_, fig. 27), though exceedingly pretty\r\nfrom its contrast in colour and form with its congeners, is still so\r\nworthless in point of feeding properties as to be little, if any, better\r\nthan a weed. It is too abundant in some moist meadows; and where it\r\nforms a very large portion of the herbage, it speaks of poverty as well\r\nas wet, and would lead to the inference that a little draining, less\r\nfrequent haymaking, and liberal doses of manure, would have a most\r\ndecidedly beneficial effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 28._ Quaking Grasses.]\r\n\r\nQuaking Grasses (_Briza media_, fig. 28, _B. minor_, _a_, and _B.\r\nmaxima_, _b_), though certainly amongst our pretty species, are all\r\nuseless to the farmer. The common species is well known in all wet or\r\npoor clay meadows, and where very abundant we should usually make our\r\ncalculations for something less than a ton of hay to the acre, and this\r\nwould generally be late, and offer little _aftermath_. Like the\r\npreceding, its indications are want of draining, manure, and\r\ndepasturing. If after the drains begin to act, sheep be folded upon a\r\nquaking-grass meadow, and fed with turnips, hay, pease, or cake, it will\r\nsoon be eradicated. _a_, the smaller species, is an annual, and is only\r\nnoticed here by way of distinction: its smaller and broader bunches of\r\nwhitish, not purple, flowers, and rectilinear branches, will distinguish\r\nit from the common form. It is comparatively rare; but we have had some\r\nfine specimens communicated by H. C. Watson, Esq., from Thames Ditton.\r\n_b_ is a garden specimen, remarkable for its larger flower bunches.\r\n\r\nThe Hair Grass (_Aira cæspitosa_, fig. 29) is commonly called hassock,\r\nor tussac grass, or bull-pates—names which its massive bunches of\r\nroot-leaves clearly indicate the meaning of. Its leaves are so rough,\r\nwith serrated edges, that cattle mostly refuse it, unless when very\r\nyoung. This grass is a never-failing indicator of wet,—so much so, that\r\nif a meadow be drained in which it abounds, the action of the drains is\r\nclearly indicated by its more or less gradual dying out. The quickest\r\nway, then, to subdue this large, coarse weed-grass is to drain, and then\r\nfold sheep upon the drying meadow: these animals tread the tussac grass\r\ninto manure, which goes to feed the better species. By this means, not\r\nonly this, but other rough or “sour” grasses are more quickly and more\r\ncertainly removed than by spudding them out; and this leads us to\r\nremark, in concluding this chapter, that in the meadow there will\r\nusually be found growing together two sets of grasses, which may be\r\ndesignated as follows:—\r\n\r\n     _a._ Grasses more or less nutritious—sweet.\r\n\r\n     _b._ Grasses more or less innutritious—sour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 29._ The Hair Tussac Grass.]\r\n\r\nIn a good meadow, the section _a_ maintain the ascendancy, and so keep\r\nunder those of _b_. In a bad meadow, the section _b_ will be master, and\r\nso tyrannize over what would be better.\r\n\r\nPerfect cultivation, then, of a meadow—for meadows should be\r\ncultivated—whilst it encourages the growth of _good_ herbage, equally\r\ndiscourages the progress of the _bad_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nON MEADOW PLANTS OTHER THAN GRASSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the grass of the field will usually be found a large proportion of\r\nplants of a very varied, variable, and different kind. Of these, many\r\nare useful as augmenting the mass, and even improving the quality of a\r\npasture; whilst, as others are altogether objectionable, we shall\r\npresently notice them under the head of “Meadow Weeds.”\r\n\r\nOf the more useful adjuncts of the meadow we may tabulate the\r\nfollowing:—\r\n\r\n  +----+------------------------+--------------------------+\r\n  |No. |     Trivial Names.     |     Botanical Names.     |\r\n  +----+------------------------+--------------------------+\r\n  | 1  | Red clover             | Trifolium pratense.      |\r\n  | 2  | Zigzag clover          |      „    medium.        |\r\n  | 3  | White or Dutch clover  |      „    repens.        |\r\n  | 4  | Birdsfoot              | Lotus corniculatus.      |\r\n  | 5  | Yellow vetchling       | Lathyrus pratensis.      |\r\n  | 6  | Purple vetchling       |     „    palustris.      |\r\n  | 7  | Saintfoin              | Onobrychis sativa.       |\r\n  | 8  | Burnet                 | Sanguisorba officinalis. |\r\n  | 9  | False burnet           | Poterium Sanguisorba.    |\r\n  |10  | Tormentil              | Tormentilla officinalis. |\r\n  |11  | Yarrow                 | Achillæa millefolia.     |\r\n  |12  | Agrimony               | Agrimonia Eupatoria.     |\r\n  |13  | Plantain               | Plantago lanceolata.     |\r\n  |    |         Some of the smaller Compositæ.            |\r\n  |    |              Ditto          Umbelliferæ.          |\r\n  +----+---------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nOf these, which are arranged pretty nearly in their order of merit, the\r\nclovers are by far the most important. These, as meadow plants, will\r\nusually be found under the following circumstances:—\r\n\r\n     No. 1. Plentiful in good, rich, sound meadows.\r\n\r\n     „ 2. Frequent in meadows on light sandy soils.\r\n\r\n     „ 3. On thin but good soil, upland meadows.\r\n\r\nThe clovers, and indeed the clover allies, _Papilionaceæ_, as a whole,\r\nare partial to lime,—so much so, that a dressing of this mineral to some\r\nfields in which clovers are scarcely represented will very quickly cause\r\nan accelerated growth of them; hence road dirt, when made from\r\ncalcareous stones, as are the _oolitic_ and mountain limestones, affords\r\na good vehicle for the admixture of manures or ameliorators, such as\r\nguano, burnt ashes, soot, nitrate of soda, &c.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks upon these three clovers are from a paper by the\r\nauthor in the _Bath and West of England Agricultural Journal_, vol. x.,\r\npart 2:—\r\n\r\n     1. _Trifolium pratense_—Meadow or Broad-leaved Clover—in its wild\r\n     state is too well known to need any lengthened description. A\r\n     careful examination of field specimens will show that even in the\r\n     wild state this plant is liable to run into numberless variations;\r\n     thus, we may have the leaflets of one plant broad and almost\r\n     obcordate at the extremity, whilst others will be more or less\r\n     ovate and lancet-shaped. In some we may see dense heads of purple\r\n     flowers, varying in shade until almost white, whilst less dense\r\n     heads of flowers and general variations in height, size, and\r\n     luxuriance of the whole plant, are all circumstances in the natural\r\n     history of this species in the wild state, which will prepare us\r\n     duly to understand the nature of the many forms of the plant which\r\n     are found in cultivation. Of these we have, besides others,\r\n     English, French, American, and Dutch sorts, which differ in such\r\n     minor details as a greater or less hairiness, or variations in the\r\n     colour and size of the flowers, leaves, _&c._ The most important\r\n     point connected with the broad-leaved clover is its permanency;\r\n     some sorts scarcely maintaining a plant for two years, whilst\r\n     others are said to be more or less perennial. This, however, is a\r\n     matter which we conceive depends more upon the soil and the kind\r\n     of cultivation than upon the sort; for although all seedsmen supply\r\n     two sorts, namely, _Trifolium pratense_ and _T. pratense perenne_,\r\n     yet they run so much the one into the other, that it is oftentimes\r\n     exceedingly difficult to distinguish them. If, therefore, a farmer\r\n     wants a good strain of broad clover, he should purchase his seed\r\n     from seedsmen possessing judgment and character; for experience has\r\n     taught us that a seed which may be all that is required in one\r\n     district may result in next to a failure in another. Thus,\r\n     clover-seed from the warmer parts of England does not succeed well\r\n     when sown in cold, exposed positions; but that from the latter is\r\n     improved on transmission to the former, whilst good changes are\r\n     effected by the occasional use of foreign seed.\r\n\r\n     The sort known in the market as _T. pratense perenne_ is probably\r\n     intermediate between the wild species _T. pratense_ and _T.\r\n     medium_. Our own experiments have shown that, on cultivating _T.\r\n     medium_, which is a sand-lover, in strong land, in three years it\r\n     has been very difficult to distinguish it from some of the\r\n     varieties of _T. pratense_. We incline, therefore, to the opinion\r\n     that as the _T. medium_ holds to sandy soils in the wild state, its\r\n     seed was brought into cultivation with a view to light-soil\r\n     cropping; and from this source has probably been derived the\r\n     so-called _T. pratense perenne_, which variety is certainly more\r\n     perennial in such light soils as would be quite unfit for the true\r\n     _T. pratense_. The latter, indeed, seems to be more permanent in\r\n     soils containing a quantity of lime, while the former, where it can\r\n     be got of a good sort, is certainly best adapted for sandy soils.\r\n\r\n     2. _Trifolium medium_—Zigzag Trefoil—is distinguished from the _T.\r\n     pratense_ by its larger, but more lax, head of reddish pink (not\r\n     purple) flowers, which are solitary, on the apex of a stalk, which\r\n     at each joint is bent at a considerable angle; hence its name. Its\r\n     leaflets are elliptical, and not broader at the upper margin. This\r\n     plant is a constant denizen of sands and light soils. In fact, its\r\n     naturally growing in soils unfitted for the broad-leaved clover\r\n     seems to recommend it for cultivation; and though, as before\r\n     pointed out, we more than suspect that the so-called cow-grass\r\n     clover was originally derived from this source, and that the _T.\r\n     medium_ is after all but a variety of the _T. pratense_, it is now\r\n     quite merged as a farm-plant into the broad-clover forms; so that,\r\n     if we are to possess it as a separate plant, it must be again grown\r\n     from the wild seed; and then, if it is to be kept pure, it must not\r\n     be cultivated on clays or limestones, or, if our view be correct,\r\n     it will soon lose its true distinctive character.\r\n\r\n     3. _Trifolium repens_—White Dutch Clover—has been long in\r\n     cultivation throughout Europe and America. It is one of our\r\n     commonest native plants, and appears to have become less changed by\r\n     cultivation than most other plants; yet there is reason to think\r\n     that with careful selection a much improved strain may be brought\r\n     about. In pastures an immense accession of Dutch clover is often\r\n     seen to follow some kind or another of top-dressing, especially of\r\n     lime, old mortar, or town rubbish. This is accounted for by the\r\n     fact that this clover is in reality of universal occurrence; and\r\n     its creeping habit of growth, besides seeding, causes it soon to\r\n     make a rapid increase where its conditions of growth are made\r\n     suitable. As an agricultural plant its position is in light soils,\r\n     for which it is usually mixed with other clovers and grasses in\r\n     varied proportions.\r\n\r\n4 and 5 are often found scattered in meadows, though not usually in any\r\nabundance in those of the richer kind; still, in laying down land for\r\npermanent pasture, there can be no objection to a small admixture of\r\ntheir seed.\r\n\r\n6, the _Purple Vetchling_, though local in rich river pastures, is yet a\r\ngood plant, and might perhaps be advantageously brought out as an\r\naddendum to mixtures designed for good lowland positions.\r\n\r\n7, _Saintfoin_, is a good pasture plant for chalks and limestones; and\r\nin laying down land for permanent pastures in such position, should not\r\nusually be omitted. It is also a good species to sow on railway banks,\r\nnot alone for the beauty of its flowers, but for the binding effects of\r\nits deeply-diving roots.\r\n\r\n8 and 9, the _Burnets_, will be found,—the _true_ in rich damp bottoms\r\nand on river flats, the _false_ on dry, calcareous soils. They are\r\nneither plants that we should care to grow; but in their wild state in\r\ntheir respective pastures we should, on the other hand, not be inclined\r\nto make war against them as weeds. The same opinion, indeed, might be\r\nbriefly expressed as regards Nos. 10, 12, and 13. In fact, the whole\r\nhere grouped may be said to possess more or less bitter and astringent\r\nqualities, and so become useful in checking the vapidity which is\r\nsometimes found in purely grass herbage.\r\n\r\n11, the _Yarrow_, should be encouraged in most pastures, as it not only\r\npossesses the qualities just mentioned, but its leaves are so small and\r\nits stems and flowers so easily dry when cut, that there is no chance of\r\nits smothering out the grass in growing, or of its retarding the process\r\nof haymaking. It also bears constant nibbling with sheep, which are\r\nremarkably fond of it, without injury, as it rather becomes finer for\r\nbeing depastured.\r\n\r\n12. The larger composite plants, as dandelion, the hawkweeds, blackhead,\r\n&c., are, from their coarseness and the room they take up, highly\r\nobjectionable; but the yellow hawkbits, thrincia, and the\r\nbefore-mentioned yarrow, are by no means objectionable.\r\n\r\n13. The above remarks will equally apply to the _Umbelliferæ_. Large\r\nplants like the cow-parsnip and common beaked parsley are objectionable\r\nfrom their size and want of feeding properties, whilst the small\r\npimpinella and earth-nut do not offer these objections. Here, however,\r\nit must be confessed that we are bordering on the domains of weeds in\r\npasture, to which we must devote a separate chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nON THE WEEDS OF PASTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Weeds in pasture!” said an old farmer friend; “I thought hay and grass\r\nwas all weeds.” This, which is by no means an uncommon notion,\r\nsufficiently explains the want of care in the cultivation of the best\r\nkinds of meadow produce, which can only be effected by the destruction\r\nof what is useless or mischievous.\r\n\r\nNow, if we proceed upon the assumption that the best kinds of meadow are\r\nremarkable for the possession of little else than the best kinds of the\r\ntrue grasses, we shall see that pasturage should, in the main, be\r\ncomposed of good grass-growth, with only some few other plants which may\r\nbe capable of augmenting quantity, by their nutritive matter, giving\r\nflavour, or improving quality.\r\n\r\nIt follows, then, that all plants having none of these requisites must\r\nbe, to all intents and purposes, only _mischievous weeds_; as thus a\r\nlarge useless plant in a meadow, as in an arable field, must not only\r\noccupy the space that would be better taken up by good plants, but it\r\nappropriates a large quantity of food to the prejudice of the better\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nViewed in this light, then, what a mass of weeds some of our pastures\r\nwill be found to contain! In fact, what with useless plants, other than\r\ngrasses, and coarse, sour, or useless grasses themselves, we meet with\r\nso-called meadows to which the terms of “barren moor” or waste land\r\nwould

Taking the broad-leaved plantain as the type of this list, we shall\r\nhave no difficulty in estimating the amount of mischief which it does.\r\nHere is a plant, a single specimen of which not unfrequently occupies\r\nnearly a square foot of ground, and as its leaves grow close to the\r\nsoil, it effectually prevents the growth of the grass, while few, if\r\nany, leaves are cut with the scythe. The bare patches which result from\r\nthe cutting up of plantains from a lawn will sufficiently establish the\r\nfirst position, whilst, if one occasionally meets with a few of the\r\nleaves cut off in haymaking, it commits the further mischief of being so\r\nlong in drying as to retard the process of haymaking, or else to\r\nendanger the safety of the rick. It is on account of this that the\r\nplantain has in some districts got the name of the “Fire Grass.”\r\n\r\nThese are easily removed by the spud, especially if a little salt be\r\nadded to their crowns.\r\n\r\n2. Taking it for granted that grasses are for the most part the best\r\nplants for pasturage and hay, it follows that the plants of this list\r\ncan only be weeds, from their taking up space and living at the expense\r\nof the wished-for crop, when, after all, the produce is either useless,\r\nor so inferior that the whole product of the field is vitiated by their\r\npresence. The best way to eradicate these and other large-leaved and\r\ntall-stemmed plants is to pull them early in the season—the true theory\r\nbeing, that by the repeated destruction of the leaves the rootstock\r\nultimately decays. Close depasturing also keeps them under for the same\r\nreason, as the feet of horses and cattle so damage the leaves as to ruin\r\nthe growth and progress of the other parts of the plant, which latter\r\nare requisite for its continuance.\r\n\r\n3. Added to the evils just adverted to, this group is injurious from its\r\nadverse mechanical appliances in spinous leaves, stings, and the like.\r\nAs regards thistles in pasture, they certainly argue great neglect, as\r\nthey may be so readily spudded out, in which the individual is\r\ndestroyed, and all hope of its progeny. It is, however, the fact that\r\nthese plants are sometimes left to seed that makes the matter of\r\ndestruction appear so hopeless, as the winged seeds of thistles may even\r\nfind their way to a clean farm from a dirty one, and roadsides and waste\r\nplaces are constant sources of annoyance from this cause.\r\n\r\nSo fast has the corn thistle increased in Tasmania, as to make the\r\npeople groan under a “plague of thistles,” for which they have invoked\r\nthe aid of special State legislation.\r\n\r\nThe spud should be kept in active operation in the field, so as to\r\nprevent these plants seeding, or indeed at all occupying any space; and\r\nroadsides and waste places should be freed from these pests, either as\r\npart of the duties of some public servant, or else as a matter of\r\nprivate necessity.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the fecundity of thistles, we append the following\r\nestimate of their seeding powers:—\r\n\r\nSEED-DEVELOPMENT OF THISTLES.\r\n\r\n  +-------------------+-------------+-----------------------------------+\r\n  |       Name.       | Seeds to a  |           Description.            |\r\n  |                   |single plant.|                                   |\r\n  +-------------------+-------------+-----------------------------------+\r\n  | Musk thistle      |    3,750    | 150 seeds to a single flower-head.|\r\n  | Spear thistle     |   30,000    | 300 seeds to each.                |\r\n  | Corn thistle      |    5,000    | This plant also increases by      |\r\n  |                   |             | creeping underground stems.       |\r\n  | Stemless thistle  |      600    | This is sometimes so thick on the |\r\n  |                   |             | downs that we have seen its flying|\r\n  |                   |             | seeds almost like a snowstorm in  |\r\n  |                   |             | quantity and whiteness.           |\r\n  +-------------------+-------------+-----------------------------------+\r\n\r\nFarmers, however, mostly refuse an early summer attack both upon\r\nthistles and nettles, quoting the following rustic rhyme for their\r\nneglect:—\r\n\r\n    If thistles be cut in April,\r\n    They appear in a little while;\r\n    If in May,\r\n    They peep out the next day;\r\n    If cut in June,\r\n    They reappear very soon,\r\n    If in July,\r\n    They’ll hardly die;\r\n    If cut in August,\r\n    Die they must.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that with spring-time they will bud forth again, but\r\nalways in a weakly condition. However, towards August the thistle has\r\nperformed all its functions for the year, and so prepared its larger\r\nrootstocks for the future season; so that he would not be altogether so\r\nmad who, in reference to the cutting of thistles and nettles in August\r\nand September, should say—\r\n\r\n    Kill a fool’s head of your own;\r\n    They’ll die of themselves if you let them alone.\r\n\r\nBeating nettles in the early part of the year with lithe ash sticks is\r\nmore effectual than the cleaner cut with the scythe, as the injuries are\r\nnot so easily got over.\r\n\r\n4. That there are many plants in pastures which if eaten exclusively\r\nwould act as poisons we can have but little doubt, but there are a few\r\nwhich would seem to be dangerous, even when partaken of in grass\r\nmixtures. Of these, the meadow saffron is one of the most powerful.\r\n\r\nThis plant is abundant on the oolitic rocks of the Cotteswolds, about\r\nwhich range we constantly hear of mischief from it. We extract the\r\nfollowing from a Cheltenham paper for September, 1844:—\r\n\r\n     It is only a few days since a farmer at Eyeford, near\r\n     Stow-on-the-Wold (Gloucestershire), had _ten calves killed by\r\n     eating of the flowers of the colchicum_, and two or three years\r\n     since three cows were destroyed by this plant in flower in the same\r\n     neighbourhood, whilst we frequently hear of many accidents to\r\n     cattle in the spring from eating the leaves, although it is\r\n     sometimes refused by them on account of its bitter and nauseous\r\n     taste. Yet there is no doubt but that accidents would be still more\r\n     frequent were it not that farmers keep their cattle from the\r\n     meadows in which it occurs in any quantity during the spring and\r\n     autumn months.\r\n\r\nPulling the leaves of the meadow saffron or colchicum will destroy it;\r\nbut a much more simple remedy is that of a thorough rolling with a\r\nCroskill at the season when the flowers begin to expand, and again when\r\nthe broad leaves come up in spring; this so crushes and bruises the\r\nwhole plant, that a season or two of such treatment will be enough to\r\nkeep it under, if not to destroy it outright.\r\n\r\nAs regards the buttercups, the most acrid one—viz., the upright tall\r\nspecies, a constant plant in marshy meadows and wet places—is the only\r\none to be particular about. Cattle do not usually eat it, but it finds\r\nits way into the hay, and there is reason to think to its prejudice. It\r\nis to be got under by draining and close depasturing, so that by\r\ntreading down it shall not seed; but poverty, induced by frequent\r\nhaymaking and wet, by keeping under the growth of what is better, gives\r\ngreater facility for the success of trash of this as well as of other\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\nErgotised grasses, by which we mean those affected with the black spur,\r\nin the place of the seed, or grain, is a common affection of grasses in\r\nautumn in low-lying or in damp places, or where fields may be enveloped\r\nin mist, as on some of our hill-ranges. This black spur is largest in\r\nthe cereal rye, but it occurs in most other species of grasses,\r\ndiffering according to the size of their seeds.\r\n\r\nErgot of rye is used medicinally, and there is little doubt but that\r\nergot in other grasses is equally active. Its effects seem to be to\r\nfavour abortion; and there is reason to believe that it has caused many\r\nvaluable animals to abort. Some few years since the late Earl Ducie\r\nsuffered a loss of calves to an extent which he calculated to equal as\r\nmuch as £1,000 in one year; at that time the grasses, consisting mostly\r\nof the perennial rye-grass, were submitted to our inspection, and they\r\nwere much affected by ergot.\r\n\r\nKeeping the cattle away from meadows known to present much of this\r\naffected grass is the best remedy; but this will seldom be necessary,\r\nexcept in unusually wet and warm seasons, which are sure to produce\r\nthese fungoid affections.\r\n\r\n5. All the plants in this section are known to give a garlic-like\r\nflavour to the dairy produce of the fields in which they grow. The two\r\nfirst especially render butter unfit for market; so that if abundant\r\nthey would take off a large portion of the value of the field. They\r\noccur mostly in patches, and should be pulled out as soon as strong\r\nenough: if this be done year by year, it will be found to diminish in an\r\nincreased ratio; and two or three seasons will be enough to rid the\r\nfield of so great a pest, and would be well worth doing if it cost\r\nmuch—which it ought not to do—as these weeds usually occur in otherwise\r\ntolerably good meadows.\r\n\r\nThe jack-by-the-hedge is usually confined to the vicinity of the fences,\r\nand may be removed by the hand or spud. It is a prolific seeder; so that\r\non no account should it ever be allowed to ripen its seed.\r\n\r\n6. Rough grasses and grass-like weeds are far too common in poor, wild,\r\nand neglected pastures. In their action they come closely to those of\r\nour second section; they are indications of a want of drainage, which\r\noperation well performed soon causes the death of this group, which end\r\nis greatly facilitated by manuring and depasturing as the drains begin\r\nto act.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this description, it may be well to remark that many more\r\nplants might have been included in the different sections; but enough\r\nhas been done to show that a pasture, to be good, must not consist of\r\nany plants which chance, accident, or more commonly neglect, may throw\r\ntogether. In arable culture one-half the expense is, in one way or\r\nother, connected with weeding, and we are of opinion, that if only one\r\nshilling per acre was spent on the weeding of pasture, it would yield\r\n300 per cent. profit on the outlay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nON THE IRRIGATED MEADOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nIrrigation, as a means of increasing the amount of pasturage, is so\r\nimportant a process that it may be well to describe it in this place.\r\n\r\nFor a perfect irrigated meadow, we should have full command of water\r\nwhenever it may be required. This water should be capable of flowing\r\nthrough, not of pouring over, and standing on the land,—this latter\r\nbeing flooding. The drainage should be so perfect that the land will be\r\nsound enough for us to walk over in the dry in a few hours after the\r\nwater has been turned off.\r\n\r\nWhere these conditions can be secured, irrigation will be found most\r\nuseful, not only in augmenting the supply of grass, but in producing it\r\nso much earlier than in the higher meadows that the farmer hereby gets a\r\nfresh green pasture, of great utility, especially in fattening and\r\nbringing on early lambs. From these circumstances it follows, that\r\nalthough some land is occupied in the water-conduits, yet the value is\r\nso far increased that meadow at 30_s._ per acre before irrigation has,\r\nunder one’s own eye, become worth £5 per acre in four years. There are,\r\nhowever, some necessary expenses in setting out the work, making\r\nfloodgates, &c., the extent of which will of course depend upon the\r\nnature of the ground. In Gloucestershire, on the banks of the Churn,\r\nwhere irrigation has been successfully carried on for years, there is a\r\npermanent cost of about 6_s._ an acre for keeping the works in order,\r\nand charges of the “drowner,” the name given to the man who overlooks\r\nthe works, in some instances of several proprietors or tenants.\r\n\r\nA peculiarity in irrigated meadow of the best quality is, the general\r\nabsence of coarse grasses on the one hand, and of any plants other than\r\ngrasses on the other; hence, then, good succulent and nutritious herbage\r\nis the rule, and anything that can be otherwise described is the rare\r\nexception. Indeed, so much is this the case, that a bit of coarse\r\ngrass—such, for instance, as _Aira cæspitosa_ (Tussac Grass)—making\r\nsuccessful growth in any part of the meadow, is at once an evidence of a\r\nstagnation of water at that spot—a condition that a clever drowner at\r\nonce looks to when he has discovered it.\r\n\r\nAs an evidence of the changes which go on as the process succeeds, as\r\nwell as of their nature, we give the following as the tabulated result\r\nof the irrigation of half of a meadow whose slope was too great to allow\r\nof the whole being operated upon. From these it will be seen that the\r\nproportionals of different pasture plants before and after irrigation\r\noffer a material change; and it may be added, that in some cases, what\r\nwould otherwise be a bad and useless grass, may become succulent and\r\nuseful from the beneficial action of water. One of this kind is the\r\n_Agrostis stolonifera_ (Fiorin Grass), which is in arable couch-grass\r\nweed, but in the irrigated meadow it becomes of a fine green colour, is\r\nnutritive in quality, and will bear with any amount of clipping. It may\r\nhere, too, be remarked that in cases where only a part of a meadow can\r\nbe irrigated, good accrues to the whole, as in depasturing the whole is\r\nranged over by our cattle and sheep.\r\n\r\nWe here give the following\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CHANGES IN GRASSES AND OTHER PLANTS UNDER IRRIGATION.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+------------------+------+--------+--------+\r\n  |   Trivial Names.     |Botanical Names.  |      | After  | After  |\r\n  |                      |                  |Before|2 Years’|4 Years’|\r\n  |                      |                  |  --- Irrigation. ---   |\r\n  +----------------------+------------------+------+--------+--------+\r\n  |Meadow Foxtail Grass  |Alopecurus        |   1  |    2   |    3   |\r\n  |                      |pratensis         |      |        |        |\r\n  |Field Meadow Grass    |Poa pratensis     |   2  |    3   |    4   |\r\n  |Rough-stalked ditto   | „  trivialis     |   1  |    2   |    1   |\r\n  |Quaking Grass         |Briza media       |   2  |    0   |    0   |\r\n  |Dogstail Grass        |Cynosurus         |   2  |    1   |    0   |\r\n  |                      |cristatus         |      |        |        |\r\n  |Hassock, or Tussac    |Aira cæspitosa    |   1  |    0   |    0   |\r\n  |Grass                 |                  |      |        |        |\r\n  |Marsh Bent            |Agrostis          |   1  |    2   |    3   |\r\n  |                      |stolonifera       |      |        |        |\r\n  |Cocksfoot Grass       |Dactylis glomerata|   1  |    2   |    3   |\r\n  |Yellow Oat-grass      |Avena flavescens  |   2  |    3   |    3   |\r\n  |Soft ditto            |  „   pubescens   |   1  |    1   |    1   |\r\n  |Meadow Barley         |Hordeum pratense  |   1  |    2   |    2   |\r\n  |Perennial Rye-grass   |Lolium perenne    |   2  |    4   |    6   |\r\n  |Meadow Crowfoot, or   |Ranunculus acris  |   1  |    3   |    1   |\r\n  |Buttercup             |                  |      |        |        |\r\n  |Bulbous ditto         |    „     bulbosus|   3  |    1   |    0   |\r\n  |Narrow-leaved Plantain|Plantago          |   3  |    1   |    1   |\r\n  |                      |        lanceolata|      |        |        |\r\n  |Broad-leaved ditto    |    „   asiatica  |   3  |    0   |    0   |\r\n  |Dutch Clover          |Trifolium repens  |   2  |    0   |    0   |\r\n  |Broad Clover          |   „     pratense |   1  |    2   |    2   |\r\n  |Common-beaked Parsley |Anthriscus        |   1  |    2   |    1   |\r\n  |                      |vulgaris          |      |        |        |\r\n  +----------------------+------------------+------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\nThe general conclusions from this table are, that large and innutritious\r\nherbage is, for the most part, destroyed by irrigation, and its place is\r\nsupplied by grasses; hence, then, the increased value conferred by the\r\nregulated action of water is due to an increase in quantity and quality\r\nof the grasses, added to a much more certain, as well as early,\r\nproduction of these. Of course the districts best adapted to irrigation\r\nwill be valleys of denudation, the centres of which are occupied by more\r\nor less copious and rapid streamlets. Some of these valleys in the\r\nCotteswolds having been scooped out of the oolitic freestones, have left\r\nthe spoils of the rock as a gravelly deposit, sometimes on the lias, at\r\nothers on the fuller’s earth, and then on the Oxford clays; so that,\r\nstiff as these soils would be by themselves, they now only tend to throw\r\nout the waters by natural drainage, which are again conducted over the\r\nporous gravels through which they flow with great regularity; thus\r\nfertilizing what would otherwise be but a scanty thin-soil herbage, and\r\nto such an extent that early depasturing, haymaking, and later pasturage\r\n(_lattermath_) are the rule year by year.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances make water-rights of great value, and which, if not\r\nin possession, are secured at a fixed charge per acre; this, however, is\r\nusually included in the expenses, which, as before stated, are covered\r\nby about 6_s._ per acre.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this chapter, we must say a few words in reference to\r\nflooded meadows. These will be found on the banks of the larger rivers\r\nor on streams of sufficient importance to be called rivers, as\r\ndistinguished from brooks or streamlets. Here the flooding is caused by\r\nthe water overflowing the banks, as the result of sudden thaws or an\r\nunusual quantity of rain. Here then the flood is not under control, and\r\nas it may happen at any and all times of the year, the grass may be\r\nspoiled by being covered with silt and drifted materials, or even the\r\nhay may be carried away by the flood.\r\n\r\nThese river flats, then, have seldom the requisites for carrying on\r\nirrigation, although the waters are of course more abundant than those\r\nsupplied by the smaller streams; for even if we could by embanking so\r\nfar control the water as to get it over the field when we might wish,\r\nyet alluvial flats like those of much of the Thames and Severn would not\r\nreadily drain.\r\n\r\nFrom facts like these it will at once be seen that there is a wide\r\ndifference between irrigation and flooding; and we have hence\r\nendeavoured to separate what is too often confounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nON THE LAYING DOWN OF PERMANENT PASTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we reflect upon the fact that much of the meadow of Great Britain is\r\nribbed by the ridge and furrow of former arable culture, we shall\r\nconclude that the laying down of land to permanent pasture is an ancient\r\nno less than a modern process.\r\n\r\nFormerly new pastures were made by sowing the collected seeds from a\r\nhayloft, but as in modern farming no one in his senses would let his\r\ngrass get ripe enough for seed before cutting, present practice\r\nnecessitates the mixing of such seeds as may be considered best in\r\nsuitable quantities for our purpose. We shall have, then, in this place\r\nto consider:—\r\n\r\n     1. The preparation of the land;\r\n\r\n     2. The kinds of seed best adapted for different places; and\r\n\r\n     3. The after-treatment of the new meadow.\r\n\r\n1. The plan usually adopted in a preparation for grass seeds is that of\r\nsowing our mixture with the barley crop. Now this, in the case of a\r\ntenant who is not sure of his tenure, would obviously recommend itself;\r\nbut to a proprietor wanting a quicker and surer result it offers many\r\nobjections.\r\n\r\nWe recommend, after turnips have been fed off on the land, to make the\r\nground as level as possible, then harrow and roll smooth with an iron or\r\nwooden roller. Upon this surface our mixture should be carefully sown;\r\nthen harrow with very light harrows just to cover the seed, and roll\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBy this plan you start the seeds in good soil instead of in that from\r\nwhich you have carried off a crop of ripened grass, straw, and seed; but\r\nbesides this, your grass will get a stronger constitution than when\r\ngrown as seedlings amid taller plants, which draw up the “seeds,” and\r\nthus make them so weak and attenuated as scarcely to be able to\r\nwithstand the rigour of winter—a matter of great consequence when our\r\nobject is to get a vigorously-growing swarth quickly.\r\n\r\n2. We come now to consider the kinds of seeds which should be sown;\r\nthese, though few in number, will yet vary according to soil and\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nOur remark that few kinds of grasses are required in laying down for\r\npermanent pasture may surprise those who have seen the usual\r\nprescriptions for this purpose; but if we start in our selection by\r\nleaving out coarse grasses,—such, for instance, as _Phalaris\r\ncanariensis_ (Reed Canary Grass), for damp meadows; annual forms, or at\r\nleast not permanent ones, such as _Lolium Italicum_ (Italian Rye-grass);\r\nand useless varieties, as _Poa nemoralis sempervirens_, _Phleum pratense\r\nmajus_, and the like,—we shall be then confined to as few species of\r\ngrass as we shall ever find will form the best parts of our best\r\nmeadows.\r\n\r\nNow, as regards sowing useless or annual species, we should recollect\r\nthat the better they come up the more mischief they create, as they take\r\nup the room that the more permanent forms should occupy, and so smother\r\nthem out. How often have we seen our friends in ecstasies at the success\r\nof their new pasture, when the smiling face had been suddenly put upon\r\nthe matter by the quick-growing Italian rye-grass having taken a\r\npossession, which, however, in a year or two it would most probably\r\nyield; and so it has happened, that while the seedsman has been\r\nadvertising a certificate vaunting of success, the pasture is declining,\r\nand the proprietor, looking for the reason for such a result, either\r\nhimself concludes, or is led so to do, that as the seeds came up well,\r\nthese were not in fault: it must then be the nature of the soil!\r\n\r\nIn giving such directions for grass mixtures as experience would seem to\r\nwarrant, we confess to a great deal of diffidence; for as scarcely two\r\ncases are alike, the difficulty is as great as would be that of a\r\nmedical man prescribing for his various patients without seeing them;\r\nindeed, to profess to do so in either case, as a general rule, savours\r\nsomewhat of quackery.\r\n\r\nThe following tables, then, it must be understood, are only meant to\r\nconvey some very general notions as to sorts of grasses and other fodder\r\nplants, and their quantities, which we should employ under the specified\r\nconditions of soil; albeit, even the quantities should be variable,\r\ndepending upon the quality of the seeds, the season, and the climate in\r\nwhich they are to be sown:—\r\n\r\n      1. _Proposed selection for rich loams in best grass-growing\r\n                              positions._\r\n  ------------------------------+---------------------------+----------\r\n         Botanical Name.        |       Trivial Name.       | Quantity\r\n                                |                           | Per Acre.\r\n  ------------------------------+---------------------------+----------\r\n                                |                           |  lb. oz.\r\n  Lolium perenne                | Perennial Rye             |  10   0\r\n  Poa pratensis                 | Meadow Grass              |   2   0\r\n  Dactylis glomerata            | Cocksfoot                 |   5   0\r\n  Festuca pratensis             | Meadow Fescue             |   3   0\r\n     „    duriuscula            | Hard     „                |   3   0\r\n  Alopecurus pratensis          | Foxtail                   |   2   0\r\n  Phleum pratense               | Catstail                  |   2   0\r\n  Anthoxanthum odoratum         | Sweet Vernal              |   0   8\r\n  Trifolium pratense            | Common Clover             |   4   0\r\n      „     repens              | Dutch    „                |   2   0\r\n\r\n    2. _Proposed selection for a poor stiff soil on a clay subsoil._\r\n\r\n  Lolium perenne                | Perennial Rye             |  12   0\r\n  Poa pratensis                 | Smooth Meadow Grass       |   3   0\r\n   „  trivialis                 | Rough     „     „         |   2   0\r\n  Festuca loliacea              | Lolium Fescue             |   2   0\r\n     „    duriuscula            | Hard     „                |   2   0\r\n  Phleum pratense               | Catstail                  |   2   0\r\n  Dactylis glomerata            | Cocksfoot                 |   6   0\r\n  Anthoxanthum odoratum         | Sweet Vernal              |   0   8\r\n  Trifolium pratense            | Common Clover             |   6   0\r\n      „     repens              | Dutch    „                |   2   0\r\n\r\n     3. _Proposed selection for thin uplands on calcareous soils._\r\n\r\n  Lolium perenne                | Perennial Rye             |  12   0\r\n  Poa pratensis                 | Smooth Meadow Grass       |   4   0\r\n  Festuca ovina                 | Sheep’s Fescue            |   2   0\r\n     „    duriuscula            | Hard       „              |   2   0\r\n  Avena flavescens              | Yellow Oat-Grass          |   1   0\r\n    „   pubescens               | Soft       „              |   1   0\r\n  Anthoxanthum odoratum         | Sweet Vernal              |   1   0\r\n  Trifolium pratense            | Common Clover             |   3   0\r\n      „     repens              | Dutch    „                |   5   0\r\n  Achillæa millefolia           | Yarrow                    |   0   8\r\n\r\n           4. _Proposed selection for light soils on sands._\r\n\r\n  Lolium perenne                | Perennial Rye             | 14   0\r\n  Poa pratensis                 | Smooth Meadow             |  3   0\r\n  Festuca duriuscula            | Hard Fescue               |  3   0\r\n  Avena flavescens              | Soft Oat-Grass            |  1   0\r\n  Anthoxanthum odoratum         | Sweet Vernal              |  0   8\r\n  Trifolium medium              | Zigzag Clover             |  4   0\r\n      „     pratense            | Meadow or Corn Clover     |  2   0\r\n      „     repens              | Dutch Clover              |  5   0\r\n  Lotus corniculatus            | Birdsfoot Trefoil         |  0   8\r\n  Achillæa millefolia           | Yarrow                    |  0   8\r\n  ------------------------------+---------------------------+----------\r\n\r\nThe above positions may so far be considered to present generic types of\r\nland which would be laid down in permanent pasture in the ordinary\r\ncourse of farming. Selections for park glades, covert, and the like, are\r\nexceptional, which must be provided for according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nWe should advise care in the selection of these seeds; the newer and\r\nfresher they are the better, as, perhaps, no seeds suffer more from\r\nkeeping than do those of the grasses. And we would further add that, as\r\na rule, we should prefer to procure our seeds separately and mix them\r\nourselves: for this we should expect to have more to pay at most houses,\r\nbut they will be much better. Of course, in all such strictures about\r\nseeds, we mean them to apply only to those who are not sufficiently\r\nparticular to keep from trade tricks, or who do not observe that care in\r\nselection and mixing that would be necessary to ensure the fullest\r\namount of success; for, as we are well aware that seeds, however old or\r\nworthless, are seldom destroyed, we should expect to have some of them\r\nsold to us if we did not look to the character, position, and judgment\r\nof our seedsman on the one hand, and be prepared to go to such, and so\r\npay a fair price, on the other.\r\n\r\nWe will now suppose that the seed has come up regularly, and so must\r\ndescribe the after-treatment. In the first year it will be all-important\r\nto look after weeds: should these make their appearance, it will be well\r\nto hoe or spud them out at once before they can seed, as then the grass\r\nwill not only have a better chance, but little provision will be left\r\nfor weed-continuance.\r\n\r\nIn the following winter, say about January, if the weather will suit, a\r\nslight but even dressing of not over-rotten manure will act as a\r\nprotection to the young plants, and provide food for their spring growth\r\nby its gradual decomposition and mixing with the soil.\r\n\r\nTowards the latter end of February, or early in March, bush-harrowing\r\nshould be employed to break up and disseminate the manure, and then the\r\nroller should be actively used to consolidate the whole; and, if the\r\ngrasses have at all thrown out, the croskill will prove a most efficient\r\nimplement. In the following May we should stock with sheep just thick\r\nenough to prevent any extent of seeding; and if the next year should\r\nshow vacant spaces, which it would be likely to do from failure or\r\nwire-worm (the latter will be less than when corn is grown), we must\r\nre-sow, mixing our seeds with a little mixed guano and soot.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are some of the simple rules upon which to act in growing a\r\npermanent pasture; and the more rigidly they are kept to at first, the\r\nsooner and the more perfect will our meadow assume the aspect we should\r\ndesire for permanency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nON THE MANAGEMENT OF PERMANENT PASTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever good our meadows and pastures may be, it is but natural that we\r\nshould wish to keep them in good condition, and, if not so good, our\r\nobject should be to improve them.\r\n\r\nWe have already adverted to weeding as a requisite in the improvement of\r\nmeadow; we are equally clear upon the subject of draining. On both of\r\nthese points, however, we have met with opposition. The farmer who\r\nconsiders that all is hay that he can get together in a rick, may look\r\nmore to mass than quality, though even here we are inclined to think\r\nthat if we take hay and pasture together, the more grasses and the less\r\nof rubbish we can get a field to grow, the greater will be our produce\r\nin quantity and quality.\r\n\r\nWith regard to draining, we are told that it takes the goodness out of\r\nthe meadow; but if we have a meadow on clay—we will suppose lias or\r\nOxford clay,—with only a few inches of a stiff soil at the surface, we\r\nshall find that those few inches are the only available root ground.\r\nDrain, and then we shall soon see that air will follow the water: this\r\nunited, air and water will decompose plant-feeding matter never before\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nNow, where the mistake has been made is, that from this time the herbage\r\ngets less and less coarse, and perhaps in some seasons would not produce\r\nthe weight of hay; but what there is both of hay and grass would be\r\nmuch improved, and would become capable of carrying better stock.\r\n\r\nThe following reply[3] of Mr. Bailey Denton to some objectors to\r\ndraining in Middlesex is, we think, much to the point on this important\r\nsubject:—\r\n\r\n     Mr. Denton stated that he had been recently over the estate of Lord\r\n     Northwick, near Harrow, in company with the noble lord and some\r\n     friends and tenants. On that occasion the question of the\r\n     reluctance of hay farmers to drain the land was discussed, and the\r\n     farmers said that as they always had a great deal of custom in\r\n     London for hay, of whatever quality it was, they did not seek so\r\n     much for quality as for quantity, and consequently did not think it\r\n     worth while to drain the land for feeding purposes, although they\r\n     admitted that draining made the herbage sweeter and better for\r\n     cattle. The present system, under which the grass-land of the\r\n     Harrow district had been cultivated for many years, alike\r\n     impoverished the hay farmers and the land; and he was of opinion\r\n     that if drained, the latter would produce grass of a much better\r\n     quality, and equally as much in quantity. He thought a good plan\r\n     would be to feed off part of the land and put the other into hay.\r\n\r\n[3] Discussion Royal Agricultural Society, March 21, 1863.\r\n\r\nIf asked what would be our criteria as to the necessity of draining, we\r\nshould say stagnant water at any time.\r\n\r\nPlants, however, afford evidence to be depended upon; as thus take the\r\nindications of a few weeds common to wet meadows:—\r\n\r\n  Sedges                 }    Show a want of        }\r\n  Rushes                 }    thorough drainage.    }\r\n  Bull-pates and other   } }  _Perhaps_ partial     }\r\n  coarse Grasses           }  or grip drainage      } Full\r\n  Devil’s-bit Scabious     }  may do.               } drainage\r\n  Buttercups (R. acris)    }  _Perhaps_ less        } certainly\r\n  Lousewort              } }  haymaking and more    } required.\r\n  Field Orchids          }    manure is indicated,  }\r\n  Cowslips               }    and draining _may_    }\r\n  Moss                   }    be done without.      }\r\n\r\nNow, as regards very wet meadows, it is found that they are seldom if\r\never manured; for, just as I was told as regards some of the low lands\r\non the banks of the Yeo, in Somersetshire, that it did not pay to manure\r\nthem; so one might easily imagine that where the land is full of water,\r\nand perhaps of moist _humus_, manure would not tend to the increase of\r\ngood grass, though it might to that of thistles and buttercups.\r\n\r\nMeadows that are sufficiently sound to yield tolerable hay are too much\r\nworked to this end, and are, we think, getting poorer. The Cheshire\r\npastures offer a good example of the effects of greed in this matter. A\r\ncentury ago we feel sure its grass-producing powers were far beyond what\r\nthey are now. Grass is gone in hay and bones and cheese, but for\r\ngenerations the farmer has gone on depasturing to make manure; but as it\r\nwill be seen, on reflection, that cattle can only deposit as manure,\r\nmatter which they have taken from the field and converted into manurial\r\nsubstance, they cannot add any new material: so then this method of\r\nrestoration must fail at last. Another restoration employed in this\r\ncounty was that of using their salt as a top-dressing. This, as it\r\nkilled all the coarse grass, and so converted it into manure, recovered\r\nthe pasture, by, out of bad and rough grass, growing good ones; but this\r\ntoo would fail in time. Hay, the framework of growing cattle, and\r\ncheese, have gone on converting the phosphates and the bone matted of\r\nthe soil into their substances, and it is now found that returning this\r\nin the shape of bones and superphosphates is rapidly effecting an\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nHence, then, we would recommend less of greed in haymaking. Do not\r\nripen the grasses too much before cutting. Don’t trust to grazing for\r\nrestoring the phosphates and other ingredients of the hay, but bring\r\nthem in the shape of manure.\r\n\r\nUse heavy rollers in spring to smooth and consolidate the soil; replant\r\nthe roots thrown out by worms; mat the turf more thoroughly together;\r\nand crush larger but useless plants.\r\n\r\nThere is, then, less difference between the cultivation of pasture and\r\nof arable land than would at first be thought.\r\n\r\nDrainage, acts of husbandry, amelioration of soil by rubbish of all\r\nkinds where too tenacious, manuring them by farmyard dung, or, failing\r\nthis, such artificial manures as bones, superphosphates, guano,\r\nnitrates, soot, &c.,—these are the sheet anchors in the improvement of\r\nour pastures; and by these we should realize the hope of _making two\r\nblades of good grass grow where one did before_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nON THE MANAGEMENT OF LAWNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe homes of our fair country are so much beautified by our\r\nnicely-shaven lawns, which nowhere are so green and smooth as in “Merrye\r\nEnglande,” that a few words upon their management can hardly be out of\r\nplace in a treatise on grasses; we would, therefore, direct attention to\r\nthe following questions connected with the maintenance of lawns in a\r\ngood condition.\r\n\r\n1. Lawns should have grasses which combine the finest possible\r\nleaf-growth with a capability of restoring growth and colour under\r\nconstant cutting.\r\n\r\n2. Lawns should be entirely free from plants other than grasses, unless\r\nwe except the Dutch clover.\r\n\r\n3. Lawn grasses should possess the property of intimately weaving one\r\nwith the other.\r\n\r\n4. After cutting, they should grow as near the same height as possible.\r\n\r\n1. _Fine Lawn Grasses._—The annexed engraving (_Festuca ovina_)\r\nrepresents one of our finest-leaved grasses; it is one, too, that will\r\neven bear the constant nibbling of sheep without losing either its\r\nvitality or its colour. This, and a larger variety called the _F.\r\nduriuscula_, are two forms of this genus well adapted for lawns.\r\n\r\nIf to these we add the _Lolium perenne_, _Poa pratensis_, and\r\n_Cynosurus cristatus_, we shall have nearly all the useful lawn grasses.\r\nAs regards _Poa pratensis_, we should, however, leave it out where we\r\nhave borders cut in the turf, as its creeping underground stems are\r\nmischievous, from their habit of getting into the borders with the\r\nflowers. This, of course, would lead us to discourage any couch-like\r\ngrass. If, then, we have plots, and the soil of the lawn be sufficiently\r\nmoist, we should recommend _Poa trivialis_ to be sought in its stead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 22_ (_bis_). Sheep’s Fescue.]\r\n\r\nSomething like uniformity of colour is desirable; as, if we see bunches\r\nof the silvery-leaved Soft Grass, or the brown patches of the _Fiorin_,\r\nit is so unsightly that we should feel the necessity of introducing a\r\nnew turf where it occurs.\r\n\r\n2. _Lawn Weeds._—Plantains, dandelions, and daisies can only be\r\nconsidered weeds whenever they occur in grass, but especially in the\r\nlawn. They are easily guarded against, if in laying down turf we only\r\nchoose clean specimens, or in laying down seeds we obtain pure samples,\r\nand sow them on well-cleaned ground. But however careful we may be, we\r\nshall be sure of a few weeds. These can be kept under by cutting them\r\nout with a knife, taking care to drop a pinch of salt on the crowns that\r\nwe leave behind; and then, if we use a little fine lawn-grass seed to\r\nthe vacant places, and well roll after the process, we shall certainly\r\nkeep them under. This should be done in spring, and not in autumn, as we\r\nshall then be more certain of success, upon the principle before\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nIf, despite all we do, a few crowns still send up shoots, our mowing\r\nmust always be frequent enough to prevent their seeding; and as in the\r\nheight of summer, seeding, in the case of all three of the plants, will\r\ntake place in a few days, such neglect as our own lawn once got when we\r\nwere away for a month’s vacation, in not being mowed sufficiently often,\r\nmay take years to remedy.\r\n\r\n3. _The Mixture of Grasses_ is secured by constant mowing and rolling,\r\nby which means anything like a wild method of grass-growth is avoided.\r\nWhen, however, a lawn is left for a long time without such careful\r\ntreatment, some of the grasses are sure to stool out and grow bunchy. In\r\nthis case, the quickest way of putting the matter to rights will be to\r\nremove the offending tufts, and introduce new turf, taking care to keep\r\nthe whole in order by the scythe and the roller.\r\n\r\nTalking, however, of these implements of lawn-culture reminds one to\r\nremark that with some the scythe and roller are almost discarded, at\r\nleast in summer. Our own lawn is rolled with an iron roller during the\r\nwinter and early spring; but when mowing begins, we prefer the new\r\nlawn-mowing machines. We have now used one of Samuelson’s for four\r\nyears, and it has not cost us a single sixpence for repairs; a strong\r\nboy can use it, and it possesses the advantages of cutting close and\r\nevenly, collecting not only the cut grass but scattered leaves as it\r\ngoes, and, withal, most completely rolling the turf at the same time. We\r\nare, too, not awoke by scythe whetting at four o’clock in the morning,\r\nto secure the dew upon the grass, as the dry part of the day is perhaps\r\nthe best for the use of the mowing-machine.\r\n\r\nThere is, then, no excuse for weeds or bunchy grass with a\r\nmowing-machine, as the whole operation, as here described, is done in\r\nless time than was formerly occupied in the scythe in mowing alone.\r\n\r\n4. _Evenness in height_ is a matter of importance for the lawn; for if\r\nwe have grasses together, some of which make three inches of growth\r\nwhile the majority are growing but one inch, the whole look uneven and\r\nugly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 31._ The Taller Grasses.]\r\n\r\nThe annexed cut (fig. 31) shows the effects of this, the taller grass\r\nbeing a root of cocksfoot, which is not only bunchy, but its leaves are\r\ntoo broad for a good lawn grass, and it grows twice as fast as the\r\nsmaller species (_a_); its colour, too, would be so much lighter than\r\nthat of the surrounding herbage as to be at once visible, and to strike\r\none as a great blemish. Here, again, the offending patch should be\r\nremoved, and better turf introduced, which operation should be performed\r\nin the autumn if possible, so as to have the full benefit the following\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nThese points in the cultivation of lawns are more particularly\r\napplicable in the process of laying down lawns with cut turves, which is\r\nthe usual practice, and especially when an immediate effect is required.\r\nIn this case, then, it cannot be too strongly urged that much trouble\r\nand expense may be saved by choosing the finest turf for our purpose;\r\nand the trouble of picking out an objectionable grass or weed before\r\nlaying down will be amply rewarded.\r\n\r\nIf it be thought desirable to sow grass seeds to get a lawn, we would\r\npropose the following mixture:—\r\n\r\n5. _Proposed mixture for lawns, cricket-grounds, bowling-greens, &c._\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+---------------------+-----------\r\n     Botanical Name.   |    Trivial Name.    | Quantity\r\n                       |                     | Per Acre.\r\n  ---------------------+---------------------+-----------\r\n                       |                     | lb.  oz.\r\n  Lolium perenne       | Perennial Rye       | 25    0\r\n  Festuca duriuscula   | Hard    Fescue      |  4    0\r\n     „    ovina        | Sheep’s   „         |  2    0\r\n  Poa pratensis        | Smooth Meadow       |  1    8\r\n   „  trivialis        | Rougher  „          |  1    8\r\n  Cynosurus cristatus  | Dogstail            |  7    0\r\n  Trifolium repens[4]  | Dutch Clover        |  8    0\r\n  ---------------------+---------------------+-----------\r\n\r\n[4] As some people object to Clover in a lawn, we should add a little\r\nmore Sheep’s Fescue in its stead.\r\n\r\nThese seeds should be sown upon clean, well-pulverized, and\r\nsmoothly-rolled ground, and the garden roller should be actively\r\nemployed from the time the grass seeds have well come up until they are\r\nfairly established, when, if mown the second year with the machine, its\r\nrolling will be sufficient.\r\n\r\nOccasionally there will be bald places in parks, such as some of the\r\nworn spots in Hyde Park, which it would be advisable to provide seed\r\nfor, that should have an immediate effect. In this case we should mix a\r\nsmall quantity of the _Poa annua_ with the above, as it not only effects\r\nthe object of making the whole look green very quickly, but so small a\r\ngrass scarcely interferes with the growth of the more permanent species,\r\nwhich would meanwhile be making their position, and so ultimately drive\r\nout the annual.\r\n\r\nIt now only remains to point out that the constant mowing of lawns,\r\nalthough it only takes away young grass, must in time have the effect of\r\nimpoverishing the lawn. In such case, the grass will not be of so bright\r\na colour as formerly, and it will become more or less mixed with moss.\r\nIn this state of matters the grasses die, and different species of\r\nagarics live upon the decaying roots.\r\n\r\nIn this condition we find that colour and fertility are restored by a\r\ngood sprinkling of soot, which usually operates very beneficially for\r\nfour or five years. After this period a little guano, say one part to\r\nthree parts of soot, will do better. Another method of restoring\r\nfertility is that of an occasional use of house slops, diluted with five\r\nparts of water; this showered evenly from a watering-pot, engine, or\r\nhydropult, usually has a most beneficial effect.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this subject of “How to Grow Good Grass,” the author would\r\nwish to impress upon his readers the important fact, that as our country\r\nis so peculiarly adapted for the growth of pasturage, and as this\r\ninteresting genus of plants furnishes the best kind of herbage, so then\r\nthe grass tribe is deserving of the most careful study of the\r\nhome-producer of MEAT, MILK, CHEESE, and BUTTER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE.—Belcher’s Plantain Extractor and Turf Inoculator will be found a\r\nmost efficient implement in extracting plantains, and preparing good\r\nturves to fill up the holes. We fancy, too, that it will be found useful\r\nin laying down land for permanent pasture by a system of inoculation,\r\nbut await the result of experiments before stating more positively.—_The\r\nAuthor._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trifolium repens. White Clover.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO GROW GOOD CLOVER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nON THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF THE CLOVER FAMILY OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nClovers are admitted by all to be such important adjuncts to the fodder\r\nplants of the farm as to render a scientific and practical treatise upon\r\nthem and their allies a matter not only of interest, but of general\r\nagricultural utility; for, if we except the grasses, perhaps no natural\r\norder of plants is of greater value to the farmer than that to which the\r\nclovers belong; for, though they differ in every point of their\r\nstructure, yet in their farm products they offer an interesting\r\nanalogy. Thus, whilst in the Graminaceous plants we have cereal or\r\ncorn-seed products, and meadow and pasture herbs, in the Leguminous\r\nplants we have a seed-producing group termed pulse, and a herb-growing\r\ngreen-food or fodder series. On either hand, in both groups, there are\r\ndifferently-cultivated forms; for, while the grass-cereals are wholly\r\nthe result of arable culture, the fodder grasses are for the most part\r\ngrown under conditions distinguished by the farmer as pasture. So of\r\nleguminous plants, pulse, such as peas and beans, belongs exclusively to\r\nthe arable part of the farm; but the fodder kinds, as clover, either mix\r\nwith the grass of the meadow, or are grown by themselves or with\r\ngrasses in shifting green crops: indeed, it is by reason of clovers\r\neking out grass, or being used as pasturage, that they have come to be\r\ndesignated “artificial grasses.”\r\n\r\nThe tribe of plants under review forms an exceedingly natural group,\r\nwhich has been named _Papilionaceæ_, from the fancied resemblance in the\r\narrangement of its flowers to the form and varied colouring of\r\nbutterflies: by others it is designated _Leguminosæ_ from the two-valved\r\nseed-pod, which by the botanist is termed a _legume_,—most perfect\r\nexamples of which are seen in the fruits of our more ordinary pea and\r\nbean.\r\n\r\nThough the flowers of the group are infinitely varied in size and in\r\ncolour, yet they afford most permanent characters in their irregular\r\npetals, which, after all, have the same parts in the variously coloured\r\nand showy sweet-pea as in the most minute clover; so that, once examine\r\nthe pea or bean, and the significance of the name of the order depending\r\nupon the flowers, will be easily understood. Again, varied as is the\r\nseed-pod, yet a little examination will show that its type is simple,\r\nthere being no structural difference between the straight legume of the\r\npea and the spirally-twisted one of the lucerne and medicks, or the\r\nmany-seeded smooth pod of the common broom and the single-seeded\r\nwrinkled pod of the sainfoin.\r\n\r\nThe seeds, again, may vary in colour; some, like those of the\r\nscarlet-runner, are curious as affording an infinite variety of\r\nself-colours for their different sorts, from pure white to absolute\r\nblack; or these may be so pencilled as to make a _testa_ or\r\nseed-covering as variously mottled as are the eggs of some of our birds.\r\nYet, whether rounded as in the pea, flat as in the bean, lenticular as\r\nin the lentil, or kidney-shaped as in the clovers, they are all readily\r\nreferred to one group by the flat, oval eye (_hilum_ of the botanist),\r\nand the fact of their ready capability of separating into two valves\r\n(_cotyledons_), so observable in our split peas and beans.\r\n\r\nBut of all the varieties in their parts presented by the pea-flowered\r\ntribe of plants,—if we except the fact that some are larger trees, as\r\nthe locust tree, ebony, laburnum, &c., whilst some are among our\r\nsmallest plants, as clovers and medicks,—the principal differences will\r\nbe found in the foliage. The grass vetchling, for example, is so named\r\nfrom its leaves being not unlike those of grasses, while the yellow\r\nvetchling, in its mature state, has the whole leaf converted into a\r\ntendril and the appendages at the bases of the leaves (_stipules_) are\r\nso enlarged as to be often mistaken for leaves: in another of the\r\nvetchlings, the everlasting sweet-pea, we find that, as so much of the\r\nleaf is converted into tendrils to enable this handsome plant to climb\r\nover the hedges and thickets, the stem is made four-winged with\r\nleaf-matter, to ensure the due performance of the leaf function. Now\r\nparts called stipules are present in this whole tribe, and, like all\r\nother parts of these plants, they vary in form, size, and markings, and\r\nhence afford important aid in the discrimination of species. Again, the\r\nold furze-bush will have its leaves converted into spines, though the\r\nseedling started with a trifoliate leaf. Points like these, however,\r\nthough most interesting to the student of vegetable physiology, are\r\nbeyond the scope of the present work.\r\n\r\nLike every other point connected with this interesting natural order of\r\nplants, their uses and properties are greatly varied, and perhaps\r\nvariable. The Sennas are renowned for their medicinal properties, being\r\nin some kinds aromatic and purgative. A powerful aroma is given off from\r\nthe Melilots, similar to that of the well-known sweet vernal grass\r\n(_Anthoxanthum odoratum_), on which account it has been recommended to\r\nmix a little of their seeds with clovers, or to cultivate separate\r\npatches of either the white or the yellow Melilot to place here and\r\nthere, sandwich-wise, in the clover hay-rick.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of this matter of flavour in food for cattle, we may here\r\nmention that the seed of one of this order, which is now being\r\nextensively employed for its flavouring principle, is the Fœnugræc\r\n(_Trigonella fœnum-græcum_), which was formerly used in large quantities\r\nby horse and cattle doctors as an ingredient in drenches or drinks for\r\nhorses, cows, and pigs. Latterly, however, it has been still more\r\nlargely employed as a flavouring matter in the different kinds of\r\n“Cattle Feeds.”[5]\r\n\r\n[5] We have cultivated these seeds in England, and found them to ripen\r\nvery well, and if the flavouring of food be correct in principle, the\r\nseeds might readily be ground with feeding stuffs, while the dried plant\r\ncould be mixed with hay and straw in chaff.\r\n\r\nNow, whether medicinal properties reside as a rule in all of the order,\r\nit would perhaps be difficult to determine; but, as we sometimes find\r\nthat certain clover crops are accused of causing “scouring,” there is\r\nperhaps reason to conclude this, but that its amount varies according to\r\nseason, soil, and cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nON THE FARM SPECIES OF CLOVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the true clovers belong to the genus _Trifolium_, of which the\r\nfollowing may be tabulated as agricultural species:—\r\n\r\n     (_Flowers red or purple._)\r\n\r\n     1. _Trifolium pratense_—Broad-leaved clover.\r\n\r\n     2. _Trifolium medium_—Zigzag, or true “cow-grass” clover.\r\n\r\n     3. _Trifolium incarnatum_—Carnation clover.\r\n\r\n     (_Flowers pink._)\r\n\r\n     4. _Trifolium hybridum_—Alsike clover.\r\n\r\n     5. _Trifolium fragiferum_—Strawberry-headed clover.\r\n\r\n     (_Flowers white._)\r\n\r\n     6. _Trifolium repens_—Dutch clover.\r\n\r\n     (_Flowers yellow._)\r\n\r\n     7. _Trifolium filiforme_—Suckling clover.\r\n\r\n     8. _Trifolium procumbens_—Hop clover.\r\n\r\n1. _Trifolium pratense_—Meadow or broad-leaved Clover,—in its wild\r\nstate, is too well known to need any lengthened description in order to\r\nits being understood. A careful examination of field specimens, however,\r\nwill show that, even in the wild state, this plant is liable to run into\r\nnumberless variations; thus, we may have the leaflets of one plant more\r\nor less ovate, whilst those of another may be broad and almost\r\nobcordate. In some we may see dense heads of purple flowers, varying in\r\nshade until almost white, whilst less dense heads of flowers and\r\ngeneral variations in height, size, and luxuriance of the whole plant,\r\nare all circumstances in the natural history of this species in the wild\r\nstate which will prepare us duly to understand the nature of the many\r\nforms of the plant which are found in cultivation. Of these we have,\r\nbesides others, English, French, American, and Dutch sorts, which differ\r\nin such minor details, as a greater or lesser hairiness, or variations\r\nin the colour and size of the flowers, leaves, &c. The most important\r\npoint connected with the broad-leaved clover is its permanency; some\r\nsorts scarcely maintaining a plant for two years, whilst others are said\r\nto be more or less perennial. This, however, is a matter which we\r\nconceive depends more upon the soil and the kind of cultivation than\r\nupon the sort; for, although all seedsmen supply two sorts, namely,\r\n_Trifolium pratense_ and _Trifolium pratense perenne_, yet they run so\r\nmuch the one into the other, that it is oftentimes exceedingly difficult\r\nto distinguish them.\r\n\r\nIn order that the reader may see the differences and agreements of the\r\nthree sorts,—1, _Trifolium pratense_ (of the meadow); 2, _Trifolium\r\npratense_ (the arable plant); and 3, _Trifolium pratense perenne_ (also\r\nof the arable),—we give their characters in parallel columns, on p.\r\n115.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS OF CLOVERS.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\r\n  |   1. _Trifolium      |    2. _Trifolium     |    3. _Trifolium     |\r\n  |       pratense._     |        pratense._    |  pratense, perenne._ |\r\n  |          ——          |           ——         |           ——         |\r\n  |    From a Natural    |From Messrs.

The stems are rounded—not channelled,—mostly\r\nof a purple colour, and clothed with short hairs. The leaves are smooth,\r\nwith elliptical—not emarginate—leaflets, sometimes, but seldom, with the\r\nwhite lunulate spot. The calyx is smooth. The heads of flowers are\r\nsolitary, on very short footstalks; they are of a bright pinkish red\r\nhue, and not of the lilac colour of the common clover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trifolium medium. Zigzag Trefoil.]\r\n\r\nIn its wild state the zigzag clover will be found in districts\r\nremarkable for the absence of lime, such as the sandstones. In the sandy\r\ndeposits accompanying the coal in Wales, as also in Staffordshire, this\r\nis the prevailing form of clover. Hence, then, this species seemed to\r\nrecommend itself for sandy lands, in which the common clover does not so\r\nwell succeed; and we conceive that, as a consequence, it was brought\r\ninto cultivation for this capability of “holding on” to such soils,\r\nwhich, if they will not grow the other kind, is considered clover sick.\r\nWe have reason to think that the _T. medium_ and _T. pratense_ are not\r\ndistinct species, but that the difference in their usual habitats has\r\ndetermined their difference in form, and we think that the _T. pratense\r\nperenne_ of the seedsman is a form intermediate between the two: if\r\nso the position of the three may be expressed as follows:—\r\n\r\n  _Trifolium pratense._            _Trifolium medium._\r\n              _Trifolium pratense perenne._\r\n\r\nAt all events, if this plant was ever distinct in cultivation, it has\r\nmerged into broad clover forms; so that, if we are to possess it as a\r\nseparate plant, it must again be grown from wild seed, and then, if it\r\nis to be kept pure, it must not be cultivated on clays or limestone, or,\r\nif our view be correct, it will soon lose its true distinctive\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n3. _Trifolium incarnatum_—Annual Carnation or Crimson Clover—is a large\r\nspecies with oblong heads of flowers of a fine carnation colour, hence\r\nits common name of “Carnation Clover.” It is a native of Southern\r\nEurope, and is said to have been found wild at the Lizard, in Cornwall.\r\nAs a cultivated plant, it has not long been introduced into England,\r\nwhere it has been much grown in the southern counties, as there it can\r\nbe sown soon enough on the wheat stubbles with only just a simple\r\nharrowing-in, when it has time to make a plant sufficiently strong to\r\nresist winter; this soon makes growth in the spring, giving an early\r\nfeed, or it may be mown; in either case it is off the land sufficiently\r\nearly to allow of a late sowing of turnips: so that, where the climate\r\nwill allow of it, we may snatch an intermediate crop by means of the\r\ncarnation clover. It yields a large crop, but its feeding qualities,\r\naccording to Dr. Voelcker, are somewhat inferior to those of the\r\nbroad-leaved clover. It should be noted that varieties having white\r\nflowers are in the market, and of both red and white there are earlier\r\nand later sorts which may be useful for succession.\r\n\r\n4. _Trifolium hybridum_—Alsike Clover—has, perhaps, got its specific\r\nname from possessing appearances and qualities intermediate between the\r\nbroad-leaf and the Dutch clovers. This species has been introduced from\r\nSweden, and its growth, duration, and feeding qualities certainly\r\nentitle it to rank high, and more especially for growth on some of the\r\nstronger soils. In our experience we have not found it to possess such\r\neminent perennial habits as have been claimed for it. It thins very much\r\nafter the second year, and almost disappears in three years, unless it\r\nbe renovated by being allowed to seed, when the new plants by no means\r\nattain to the vigour of their parents.\r\n\r\n5. _Trifolium fragiferum_—Strawberry-headed Clover—has been named from\r\nthe strawberry-like form which its head, of enlarged coloured calyxes,\r\nassumes after flowering; its flowers are pinkish, but otherwise of much\r\nthe same size and form as those of the Dutch clover, which latter it\r\nagain approaches in its creeping habit and form of its foliage. It is,\r\nhowever, here mentioned only to point out the difference of its habits\r\nand indications when compared with the Dutch or white clover. The\r\nstrawberry trefoil is a native of cold wet pastures, such as bear the\r\nname of “hungry clays;” when present in quantity it is not to be\r\nconfounded with Dutch clover, which would indicate a sound fertile soil.\r\n\r\n6. _Trifolium repens_—White Dutch Clover—is a plant of very general\r\ncultivation, both at home and in the States, and in both of which\r\nquarters of the globe it maintains its character with great constancy.\r\n\r\nDutch clover is a valuable pasture plant either in meadows or in seeds.\r\nIn the former it is much increased by the addition of nitrates, soot,\r\n&c., with guano or superphosphate. As a plant, in seed mixtures, it is\r\nusually sown with other trifoliate plants and rye grasses, but if the\r\nsoil be very light the Dutch clover may be increased or wholly used.\r\n\r\n7. _Trifolium filiforme_—Small Yellow Clover—is one of the least of our\r\nsmall yellow-flowered division. It is a common native species occurring\r\non the waysides, and has been brought into cultivation to only a limited\r\nextent, under the impression that its small herbage is suitable as a\r\nfirst bite for young stock, and hence the term “suckling clover” has\r\nbeen applied to it. It is of little value, and does not seem capable of\r\nbeing greatly improved. This species is often mistaken for the\r\nfollowing, even by pretended botanists, but its lax head of smaller\r\nflowers will well distinguish it.\r\n\r\n8. _Trifolium procumbens_ is called by the botanist “Hop Trefoil,” from\r\nthe fact that its dried head of persistent flowers[6] exactly resembles\r\nsmall bunches of hop _strobiles_ (fruiting heads). The foliage is much\r\nlike that of _Medicago lupulina_, nonsuch, or black medick, which is the\r\n“hop” of the farmer; but the whole plant of the true hop trefoil dries\r\nup so quickly under the sunshine, and is withal so wanting in succulency\r\nand quality, that it cannot be compared with _M. lupulina_ as a fodder\r\nplant, and hence it is but little cultivated in the present day.\r\n\r\n[6] Flowers are so called that remain enveloping the seed while it\r\nripens, which they do in all the clovers.\r\n\r\nThere are other clovers which have been recommended for cultivation,\r\nbut they are mostly foreign, and do not appear to possess those\r\nqualities which should lead us to prefer them before those in common\r\nuse. There are, too, several additional wild clovers, but they possess\r\nno agricultural interest, unless, perhaps, as indicators of soil. The\r\n_Trifolium pratense_ (Hare’s-foot Trefoil) is a pretty, wild species,\r\nnative to light sandy soils, the seed of which is sold for growing\r\n“bedding plants.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nON THE VARIETIES OF RED CLOVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Trifolium pratense_ of botanical authors is remarkable for the\r\ngreat number of varieties it assumes, even in its wild growth; but these\r\nare exceeded in the number of cultivated forms: thus in any rich meadow\r\nwe may make out several sorts which may be expected to be more or less\r\npermanent, whilst the market samples of seed will offer us several\r\nvarieties for the different countries of America, England, France,\r\nHolland, Germany, &c.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the more prominent of our native wild\r\nvarieties:—\r\n\r\n     1. _Trifolium pratense_—Common Red Clover.—Head of pink; flowers,\r\n     somewhat compact; leaves more or less broad; plant smooth[7] in\r\n     proportion to its size, the smaller wild specimens being usually\r\n     very hairy; stem more or less purple.\r\n\r\n[7] In this, as well as the generality of forms, the smoother and larger\r\ngrowth indicates cultivation, manuring will sometimes make the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\n     2. _Trifolium pratense_, var. _pallidum_—Pale-flowered Clover.—Head\r\n     of very light pink; flowers large, full, and more rotund than 1,\r\n     and almost double in size and in the number of its flowers; whole\r\n     plant more or less hairy; stem green.\r\n\r\n     3. _Trifolium pratense_, var. _album_—White Clover.—Flowers white;\r\n     herbage a very light green; in other respects much the same as the\r\n     last.\r\n\r\n     4. _Trifolium pratense perenne_—Perennial Red Clover.—Flowers less\r\n     compact than the common clover, whole plant having stems inclining\r\n     to dark purple; leaves narrower.\r\n\r\n     5. _Trifolium pratense perenne_, sub-var. _pallidum_—Pale Perennial\r\n     Clover.—A larger plant than the parent form, and less hairy.\r\n\r\n     6. _Trifolium pratense perenne_, sub-var. _album_—White Perennial\r\n     Clover.—Not common, but still, like 3, an albino form, and is,\r\n     perhaps, more delicate in constitution than the coloured sorts.\r\n\r\nNow, it appears to us that the descendants of the two types, _Trifolium\r\npratense_ and _T. medium_ (see Plate) form the basis of the red or\r\nbroad-leaved clover on the one hand, and the perennial or cow-grass\r\nclover on the other; whilst the market varieties have, perhaps, been\r\nmodified by climate, soil, and probably hybridization with other sorts.\r\nIt may, indeed, be that, after all, the plants described in chapter\r\nXVII. as two distinct species are only varieties, for though the common\r\nform of _T. pratense_ grows everywhere on mixed soils, the more sandy\r\npositions, as the sandstones connected with the coal in South Wales,\r\noffer a greater abundance of the _T. medium_; and, from experiments\r\nconducted with seed of this latter obtained from near Swansea,\r\nGlamorgan, and sown on forest marble clay of the Cotteswolds, we\r\ncertainly obtained plants differing very much from the typical form of\r\n_T. medium_, and assuming the usual broad-leaved clover variations.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is opened up a curious subject for inquiry, which the\r\nhistory of the seed trade as it relates to clover-seed may tend in some\r\nmeasure to elucidate. Some few years ago _T. pratense_ and _T. medium_\r\nwere advertised as on sale by most seedsmen; in fact, the latter was the\r\nname by which what is now called cow-grass clover was known. Now,\r\nhowever, it is doubtful if any seedsman would pretend to send out the\r\n_T. medium_; but the label _T. pratense perenne_ has been substituted\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nSinclair’s figure of “Trifolium medium, marl-clover, cow-grass,” in the\r\n“Hortus Gramineus Woburnensis,” facing page 141, is scarcely a true form\r\nof the plant, as its more or less emarginate leaflets incline to the\r\nform of _T. pratense_; and yet, at the time this author wrote, even this\r\nwas doubtful. _T. medium_ was difficult to obtain, as he says, “All the\r\nseeds and plants I have had for this (except that from Messrs. Gibbs &\r\nCo., which proved to be the present plant—_T. medium_ of Sinclair) have\r\nturned out only two-year lived plants, or never exceeding three, though\r\ncultivated on various soils.” We have repeatedly written for seed, and\r\nten years ago were always supplied with samples so labelled; but in no\r\ncase did we get it. Latterly seedsmen honestly confess that they have\r\nnot the seed, but can send _T. pratense perenne_.\r\n\r\nNow, that this latter is merely a variety of the broad-leaved clover\r\nthere can be but little doubt; still the fact that it is usually more\r\nperennial in its habit is of importance. We may easily understand why it\r\nshould be so, if we consider that the common broad-leaved clover in its\r\ncultivation is so much earlier than the cow-grass form, so that this\r\nenables two cuttings of the former to be made in one season, two crops\r\nof hay being taken very commonly indeed; and as the plant gets well in\r\nflower before it is cut the first time, and seed is saved from the\r\nsecond crop, a more exhaustive plan for the crop itself or its future\r\nperennial powers could hardly be brought about. The cow-grass clover,\r\nhowever, is a fortnight and more later, which renders it difficult to\r\ncut two crops; and so its method of growth is not so exhaustive. We know\r\nthat the common wild clover is said to last only two years, but with\r\nconstant depasturing we see no reason why the same roots should not send\r\nup herbage for five or even ten years.\r\n\r\nHowever theoretical such inquiries may be deemed, yet it must be\r\nconfessed that they are of great practical importance; for, if a plant\r\nhas a tendency to run into varieties, it makes it daily more difficult\r\nto get its seed true to sort; and if we are liable to have a sample,\r\npart of which may be less hardy or part more tardy in its development,\r\nit follows that much of it may never arrive at maturity, whilst if it\r\ndoes, as the crop will be uneven, it can never be reckoned upon for so\r\ngood a yield.\r\n\r\nMuch of the variable nature of the sorts which we observe in a\r\nclover-field may be the result of the mixing of seeds from different and\r\ndistant localities: if so, it is much to be regretted. But this only\r\ntends to show us how important it is that seed should be grown with\r\ncare, to which end, as regards clover-seed, we sadly want some\r\nwell-conducted experiments on different varieties, especially of a wild\r\nnative plant, with a view to obtain a sample with good, permanent, and\r\neven qualities. In fact, the question of true of sort is altogether\r\ndifferent from that of purity of sample; but that very serious mischief\r\narises from the want of the latter will be discussed in another\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nON THE CLOVER ALLIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the clovers proper, there are many native plants of the same\r\nnatural order that have been found useful as fodder: these it is now\r\nproposed to comment upon, premising that as we have had them all under\r\ncultivation, we are enabled to discuss their merits from a practical\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nOf these, the following is a list of the genera:—\r\n\r\n     I. ULEX.—A spinous shrub.\r\n\r\n     II. ANTHYLLIS.—Flowers in a dense head, with white expanded\r\n     calyces.\r\n\r\n     III. LOTUS.—Flowers in lax heads; pod straight, many-seeded.\r\n\r\n     IV. MEDICAGO.—Flowers various; pod spirally twisted.\r\n\r\n     V. MELILOTUS.—Flowers in spikes, drooping to one side; pod\r\n     straight, few-seeded.\r\n\r\n     VI. ONOBRYCHIS.—Flowers in spikes, drooping; pod wrinkled,\r\n     one-seeded.\r\n\r\n     VII. VICIA.—Flowers single or spicate in the axils of the leaves;\r\n     pod straight, many-seeded.\r\n\r\n     VIII. LATHYRUS.—Flowers one or many on long footstalks.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. ULEX—_Furze_.\r\n\r\nA genus of shrubby, spinous, pea-flowered plants, by far too common on\r\nour sandy heaths and wild hilly places, with varieties occupying wet\r\ncommons.\r\n\r\nWe possess, according to authors, some two or three native species; but\r\nwe incline to the belief that they are only varieties of the common _U.\r\nEuropæus_, of which these seem to be large and dwarf forms. This plant,\r\nunder the name of furze or gorse, has been from time to time highly\r\nextolled as a fodder plant, and machines have been invented for bruising\r\nits complicated spines; but although it will doubtless grow where\r\nscarcely anything else can be got to succeed, yet, taking into\r\nconsideration the expense attendant upon its growth and utilization, and\r\nthe low feeding powers which it possesses, we cannot at all agree in\r\nrecommending its general use. It is, however, but right here to say that\r\narticles are from time to time inserted in such journals as the\r\n_Agricultural Gazette_, the authors of which advocate the growth of\r\nfurze as an agricultural plant, and highly extol its feeding qualities;\r\nstill, as our own experience would lead us to conclude that as even\r\nyoung stock scarcely hold their own upon this plant, we cannot recommend\r\nit as possessing very valuable properties.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. ANTHYLLIS—_Ladies’ Fingers_.\r\n\r\nThe _Anthyllis vulneraria_ is well distinguished in its young state from\r\nits sometimes entire lancet-shaped, at others pinnate leaves, growing\r\nclose to the ground. These are usually clothed with long hairs, and it\r\nhas expanded downy calyces, when full grown. In its young condition it\r\nhas been very much extolled for sheep pasturage, while its hay is said\r\nto be abundant and nutritious, though grown on the very poorest of\r\nsoils. That it will grow more upright where sown, one plant drawing up\r\nanother, we know from experience, but we have little faith in any very\r\nsuperior qualities being found in plants that can grow so well under\r\nextremely poor conditions of soil; still it is just possible that its\r\nherbage may improve in quantity and quality by liberal treatment; yet we\r\nmust conclude that, as we already possess much better plants for growing\r\non better soils, we do not think much can be gained by its cultivation.\r\n\r\nAs a plant for hay it will yield a good cut, but its extreme hairyness\r\nand general want of what the farmer calls “proof” will never allow this\r\nplant to be extensively grown.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. LOTUS—_Bird’s-foot Trefoil_.\r\n\r\nThis plant is well known by its loosely-packed heads of bright yellow\r\nflowers, which are succeeded by long slender pods, dark-coloured or even\r\nblack when ripe, and not inaptly likened to a crow’s foot; and hence the\r\nname “Crowsfoot” which it commonly bears. We have three species, as\r\nfollow:—\r\n\r\n1. _Lotus corniculatus_—Common Bird’s-foot Trefoil—is common, especially\r\nin dry meadows, in which its herbage is duly appreciated by sheep and\r\ncattle, if one may judge from the pertinacity with which it is kept\r\ndown. It is no bad adjunct to the rick. We are so convinced of its value\r\nas always to recommend its use in the laying down of light land for\r\npermanent pasture, and a little seed sown in old meadows after a\r\ndressing of rubbish—old mortar, town refuse, &c.—will tend greatly to\r\nthe improvement of the herbage.\r\n\r\n2. _Lotus tenuis_—Slender-leaved Bird’s-foot Trefoil—is, perhaps, only a\r\nvariety of the former; it is, however, smaller in all its parts, and,\r\nthough a denizen of stiff soils, occurs chiefly in a wild state on the\r\nmargins of fields and on hedge-banks. It might be employed under the\r\nsame circumstances as the _L. corniculatus_, especially in thin\r\nclay-beds on upland brashes; but it hardly possesses such good\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\n3. _Lotus major_—Larger Bird’s-foot Trefoil—is much larger in all its\r\nparts than the other species. It occurs in moist situations, about\r\nbushes in wet land, in ditches, watercourses, and damp places generally.\r\nWe have experimented upon the growth of this plant in artificial\r\nmeadows, and from the size which it attains quite early in summer, and\r\nthe quantity of wholesome keep it is capable of affording, we are\r\ndisposed to think well of it as an occasional shifting crop, or it might\r\nbe well combined with rye-grass in deep stiff soils.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. MEDICAGO—_Medick, &c._\r\n\r\nThis genus is principally distinguished from _Trifolium_ by its twisted\r\nseed-pods, which in the _Medicago maculata_ (Spotted-leaved Medick) form\r\nquite a spiral coil, ornamented with a double fringe of stiff spines.\r\nThis plant is now becoming general as an agrarian weed, having been\r\ngreatly spread, owing to its intermixture with foreign seeds of\r\ndifferent kinds.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural species are:—\r\n\r\n_Medicago lupulina_—Yellow Sickle Medick.—“Hop trefoil” of the farmer,\r\nbut not of the botanist, who gives this name to the _Trifolium\r\nprocumbens_ (which see). From this latter the medick is easily\r\ndistinguished by its heads of naked, blackened, incurved seed-vessels.\r\nAs an agricultural plant it is of great value, especially in mixtures\r\ncalled “seeds.” It is a good adjunct to rye-grasses and common clovers,\r\nespecially on light soils; but on good strong land which will bear a\r\nfull crop of broad-leaved clover it would be mostly smothered out, and,\r\nif not, as we think it is properly held to be less nutritious than\r\nclover, its use is not recommended where first-rate clover crops can be\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\nWe have seen this trefoil grown with sainfoin to great advantage, as it\r\nyields a tolerable crop for the first two years, and then declines, just\r\nas the sainfoin has got possession of the soil.\r\n\r\n2. _Medicago sativa_—Lucerne—is a perfectly perennial plant, which,\r\nthough not so much grown in England as it deserves, yet scarcely needs\r\ndescription; however, its purple flowers and smooth twisted seed-pods\r\nserve to distinguish it from the rest of the genus. We have grown this\r\nplant upwards of a foot high by the 1st of May, and taken no less than\r\nthree cuttings of a good succulent herbage in one season. These\r\nqualities point out lucerne as an excellent green-food plant, for which\r\npurpose we should always, where practicable, recommend that at least a\r\npatch should be grown near the stable, as there is reason to believe\r\nthat its alterative effects upon the horses are of a most salutary kind.\r\nIt should be cultivated in drills of from 15 to 18 inches apart; and, if\r\nproperly weeded and not let get too old before cutting, it will last for\r\nmany years with an occasional dressing of manure.\r\n\r\nWe once had a patch one half of which was purposely neglected by way of\r\ncomparison with the other half, which was well cared for; that portion\r\nleft to itself yielded but poor crops, and almost disappeared at the end\r\nof four years, whilst the other portion scarcely began to decline after\r\nten years. This remark applies with full force to all the green-food\r\ncrops of this order. Weeding early, mowing when cut, and an occasional\r\ntop-dressing, would increase the durability of all the perennial\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. MELILOTUS—_Melilot_.\r\n\r\nThese are pea-flowered plants, with ternate leaves, and spikes of\r\nflowers drooping to one side: it is named from _mel_, honey, in allusion\r\nto its flavour, and the genus _Lotus_, by which we may understand it to\r\nbe a sweet-scented lotus-like plant. We have two native species,\r\ndistinguished thus:—\r\n\r\n_Melilotus officinalis_, an annual, with yellow flowers.\r\n\r\n_M. leucantha_, a biennial, with white flowers.\r\n\r\nOf these we may conclude that the flavour, which is like that of the\r\n_Anthoxanthum odoratum_—sweet vernal grass—is too strong and bitter to\r\nallow of its being recommended for culture alone; but we are inclined to\r\nthink that, if grown in small quantity with seeds, or if a separate\r\npatch be cut and arranged sandwich-wise in the seed-rick, the melilots\r\nwould give that sweet flavour which seems to be the principal cause of\r\nthe superior qualities and sweetness of natural meadow as compared with\r\nartificial grasses.\r\n\r\nSeeds have been forwarded to us of what is named “Cabool Clover,” and\r\nanother packet labelled “Bokhara Clover,” both of which appear to belong\r\nto the _M. leucantha_, though certainly of a larger form than our native\r\nspecies, and probably consisting of the _M. leucantha major_. This\r\nlatter must be cut young if used as recommended, as it soon gets woody.\r\nA correspondent of the Royal Agricultural Society has recently\r\nrecommended the full-grown plant for paper-making; and, if of value for\r\nthis purpose, we can affirm from experience that a large yield can be\r\ngot from soils of a very inferior quality, as our experiments on its\r\ngrowth have been made on a very stiff and poor bed of forest marble\r\nclay.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. ONOBRYCHIS—_Sainfoin_.\r\n\r\nSainfoin, or “holy fodder” of the French, is distinguished by its\r\nbrilliant spike of pink variegated flowers, which droop to one side, its\r\nwinged leaves of from six to eight pairs of oval leaflets, which are\r\nentire, that is, undivided at the margin, and its short, rounded,\r\nwrinkled, and spinose seed-vessels. The forms in cultivation are—\r\n\r\n_Onobrychis sativa_—Common Sainfoin. _Onobrychis sativa_, var.\r\n_bifera_—Giant Sainfoin. Of these the former has the preference in\r\nEngland, whilst the latter is much grown in France. Our experiments with\r\nboth lead us to conclude, that although the former flowers but once and\r\nthe latter twice in the season, the _O. sativa_ still gives the greatest\r\namount of food, as the second crop of the giant sort is usually poor and\r\nstraggling, with but little leaf; while the common sort sends up a thick\r\ngrowth of leaves after being cut.\r\n\r\nThe _O. sativa bifera_ is but a variety of the _O. sativa_, as by long\r\ncontinuance of growth from the same seed in this country it reverts to\r\nthe common form; and hence the giant sort should be frequently renewed\r\nfrom an imported stock. Sainfoin has been much cultivated on calcareous\r\nsoils, more especially on the free-stones of the oolite rocks, and on\r\nthe chalk, off which formations it is scarcely known, except on some\r\ncalcareous sands in the eastern counties. In the limestone and chalk\r\ndistricts sainfoin is grown as a permanent crop, and formerly lasted six\r\nor eight years. In the eastern counties the little there grown is by way\r\nof a shifting crop, in the same place and manner as common clover. The\r\npermanency of sainfoin is yearly becoming greatly diminished from the\r\ncircumstance that its seed is so much mixed with that of the burnet,\r\n_Poterium sanguisorba_, var. _muricata_. To such an extent does this\r\nevil occur, that we have examined samples of sainfoin seed in which\r\nthere were at the rate of from twenty to forty thousand of burnet\r\nseed-pods per bushel; and when we consider that these pods have for the\r\nmost part two ripened seeds, and those of a plant growing so much more\r\nrapidly than the sainfoin, we can form some notion how the desired crop\r\nis soon smothered and overpowered by the burnet, which at best is but a\r\nrank weed, of no agricultural value; for whatever of good there may be\r\nin our ordinary native salad burnet, which is a smaller and more\r\nsucculent plant, this sticky foreign interloper cannot possibly have any\r\nclaim to our regard.\r\n\r\nThe reason why it has gone on so long unchallenged is that the\r\nburnet-seed, though of an entirely different shape from the sainfoin, is\r\nsomewhat of the same colour; and then in their growth both plants have\r\nwinged leaves, and the difference between the entire leaflets of the\r\nsainfoin and the toothed leaflets of the burnet did not at first strike\r\nthe farmer; now, however, the difference is better understood, and\r\nfarmers begin to require that the burnet-seed shall be sifted from the\r\nsainfoin. This of course will demand the payment of a better price for\r\nthe better sample, as in the process of sifting many of the smaller\r\nsainfoin seeds go through with the burnet; but this will be well worth\r\na better price, as the larger seeds will undoubtedly tend to produce a\r\nbetter crop.\r\n\r\nIf, however, there should be any doubt about pure sainfoin seed, we\r\nshould recommend the decorticated seed being used, as in it the burnet\r\ncould not possibly escape detection.\r\n\r\nAs the history of burnet is so important in connection with the sainfoin\r\ncrop, it cannot be out of place to introduce the following description\r\nof this weed:—\r\n\r\nThe _Sanguisorba officinalis_ (false burnet), as a wild plant, never\r\nattains any great size, and as it is a denizen of dry calcareous\r\npastures and broken ground on limestones, and perfectly harmless in its\r\nproperties in this condition, it is scarcely noticeable as a weed;\r\nindeed, it is sometimes recommended for permanent pasture admixture on\r\ncalcareous uplands. There is, however, a larger form of the false\r\nburnet, which is now attracting considerable attention, as being by far\r\ntoo constant an attendant upon sainfoin seed.\r\n\r\nThis plant is referred by Professor Babington and the Continental\r\nbotanists to another species, viz., _Poterium muricatum_, which is by\r\nthem distinguished from the _P. sanguisorba_; but is “usually larger in\r\nall its parts” (Bab.), with a larger and more decidedly four-winged\r\nfruit. We, however, agree with Bentham in considering this to be a\r\nvariety only, and, in fact, an agrarian form, induced by its seed being\r\ngathered with a crop and treated as a crop plant, so that its larger\r\nform may be easily accounted for; and we are not wanting in evidence to\r\nshow that, under cultivation, the _P. sanguisorba_ greatly increases in\r\nsize, while, if left to grow wild, the cultivated form relapses into\r\nthe wilder state. But we incline to think that the agrarian burnet has\r\ngot into agriculture by being introduced with foreign seeds; and as its\r\nintroduction seems to have been small at first, it attracted but little\r\nnotice; for as the leaves both of the burnet and sainfoin were pinnate,\r\nthe difference that the botanist would observe in the leaflets, _i.e._\r\nthe former being serrate, and those of the latter having an entire\r\nmargin, would hardly attract the attention of the farmer; however, it\r\nsoon became so serious a matter that some crops of so-called sainfoin,\r\nin their second or third year, presented as much as 90 per cent. of\r\nburnet, and as the latter grew taller than the sainfoin, it effectually\r\nsmothered it out, and in its place supplied a sticky, non-succulent, and\r\ninnutritious herbage, that made farmers begin to inquire seriously about\r\nthe seed.\r\n\r\nHere, however, as the seeds, or rather the fruits, of both plants were\r\npretty much of the same colour, and both wrinkled, samples of fully half\r\nburnet passed muster in the seed-market; and, though these fruits are so\r\ndifferent in shape and size, yet we were astonished to find that, during\r\nthe trial of an action against a seedsman for supplying sainfoin seed\r\ncontaining a large quantity of burnet when good sainfoin seed was paid\r\nfor, the judge, jury, and most of the farmers present confessed their\r\ninability to distinguish them; it becomes, therefore, at this point, a\r\nduty to describe the two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 32._]\r\n\r\nFig. 32 _a_ represents a short wrinkled pea-pod, broad at the back and\r\nthin in front, as seen in the section _b_. In the interior is a single\r\npulse-seed, which is easily freed from its wrinkled shell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 33._]\r\n\r\nFig. 33 _a_ is a drawing of a fruit of false burnet. The section _b_\r\nshows it to be quadrangular, with a wing at each angle, and to possess\r\ntwo seeds in each capsule. The capsules are rather muricated (_i.e._\r\nfurnished with short excrescences, and not regularly wrinkled, like the\r\nsainfoin). Now the burnet is easily separable from a sample of sainfoin,\r\nas the former readily passes through the sieve; but the objection to\r\nsift it may be well understood when the bulk is diminished by the amount\r\nof the burnet, and also that of the smaller sainfoin seeds, which pass\r\nthrough at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe best plan, then, to pursue is to mill the sainfoin seed, in which\r\ncase its outer covering is removed, and you simply have a sample of\r\nkidney-shaped pure seed-like enlarged clover-seeds, in which the burnet\r\nmay be detected, because it will not mill, but simply gets its wings\r\nbroken off, so that the wrinkled two-seeded capsule still remains.\r\n\r\nNow the fact of the burnet being a two-seeded capsule is most important\r\nto be noticed, as, from analyses we have made of dirty sainfoin crops,\r\nwe have estimated as follows:—\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------+----------+--------+----------+\r\n  |           Crops.              | Sainfoin | Burnet |  Other   |\r\n  |                               |  Plant.  | Plant. |  Weeds.  |\r\n  +-------------------------------+----------+--------+----------+\r\n  |Crop in Berkshire, 3rd year    |    10    |   50   | 40 = 100 |\r\n  |Crop in Cirencester, 3rd year  |     5    |   25   | 70 = 100 |\r\n  +-------------------------------+----------+--------+----------+\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have a large proportion of burnet, surely much more than\r\ncould be accounted for from the number of capsules, at least we will\r\nhope so; but when we consider that the capsule of the sainfoin is\r\n_single-seeded_ and that of the burnet is _two-seeded_, we may readily\r\nconceive how each capsule of the latter may at least grow a single seed,\r\nbut the best sample of the former could hardly be expected to all come\r\nup. Now, as we have as many as 64,000 capsules of burnet in a bushel of\r\nsainfoin seed, that × 2 = 128,000 seeds, and when we consider that the\r\nburnet grows so much faster than the sainfoin, we have two elements for\r\nthe success of the former, namely, the certainty of getting its crop,\r\nand the equal certainty of smothering out a large proportional of what\r\nmay germinate of the seeds of the sainfoin.\r\n\r\nThis matter would not be of such importance if the burnet was equal in\r\npoint of feeding properties, but it is not so, for whatever quality be\r\nin the smaller and more succulent _P. sanguisorba_ form, the _P.\r\nmuricatum_ is, on the contrary, hard and woody, and almost useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nON CLOVER SICKNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn considering the important question involved in the term “Clover\r\nsickness,” we would first direct attention to the fact that crop clover\r\nis a derivative plant which has been so _forced_ that it is many times\r\nlarger and more juicy and succulent than the wild plant from which it\r\nsprung. This _derived_ nature (the propensity, as it were, for\r\nfattening) can only be maintained by a continuance from one generation\r\nto another of those luxuries to which the cultivated family has been\r\naccustomed; hence, then, if seed be brought from a richer soil to a\r\npoorer, or from a warmer to a colder climate, we may expect that its\r\nplants grown amid barley and drawn up during the summer would have but a\r\npoor constitution to withstand the rigours of winter; but can we in such\r\na case say that the _land_ is clover-sick, that is, sick of growing\r\nclover?\r\n\r\nOf course the seed here supposed will grow better in one place than in\r\nanother, as, for example, we have traced some American seed of\r\nbroad-leaved clover grown by itself in a deep rich soil in the Vale of\r\nGloucester, where the climate is so much milder as to be a fortnight\r\nbefore the elevated land of the Cotteswold Hills and producing an\r\nabundant crop; while the same forming part of a mixture of “seeds” with\r\nrye-grass and plantain on the hills, the two latter have taken\r\npossession of the soil, and the clover made no progress at all; whilst\r\nother seed, under precisely the same circumstances, has done remarkably\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nThat there is much reason for these conclusions will be found in the\r\nfact that the more seed we import from warmer climates the more\r\ndifficult is it found to make the land produce a plant; still\r\nimportation is rapidly on the increase, because warmer climates can\r\nproduce seed more certainly and in greater quantity than we can at home.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of growing from foreign seed increases in proportion to\r\nthe thinness of the soil and the backwardness of the climate, so that\r\nthe elevated districts on the stony Cotteswolds just adverted to\r\npresent, perhaps, more of the so-called clover-sick land than any other\r\nof like extent.\r\n\r\nThe seed of clover, then, has become more and more pampered—more the\r\noffspring of large crops from deep alluvial soils under the tropical\r\nsummer heat of the south of France and the United States, where it is\r\ngrown as a self-crop and not fed merely on what the corn could not carry\r\naway; and so while this enervation, or, if preferred, this civilization,\r\nof plant has gone on, we expect its seed all at once to withstand the\r\nshock of a lower temperature with constant climatal changes and cutting\r\nwinds; and if it does not succeed, we say that the land is clover-sick,\r\nwhen, in truth, it is the seed that sickens under these new and trying\r\nconditions. As well may we say that the Northern States sicken of the\r\nnegro, because he there dies out so rapidly, or that the warm south\r\nsickens of humanity, because those who are unacclimated sicken and die\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance which has contributed to an increased difficulty\r\nin growing clover on thin soils will be found in the farmer discarding\r\nas antiquated the practice of paring and burning, which was formerly the\r\nusual preparation for the turnip crop. In a paper on “Paring and\r\nBurning,” in the 18th volume of the _Journal of the Royal Agricultural\r\nSociety_, Professor Voelcker remarks:—\r\n\r\n     The ashes produced by paring and burning are especially useful to\r\n     turnips, and also to other green crops, because they contain a\r\n     large proportion of phosphates and potash—constituents which, it is\r\n     well known, favour in a high degree the luxuriant growth of\r\n     root-crops.\r\n\r\nFurther, the learned professor closes a most able paper with the\r\nfollowing conclusions:—\r\n\r\n     Paring and burning, instead of being an antiquated operation, is a\r\n     practice the advantages of which are fully confirmed and explained\r\n     by modern chemical science.\r\n\r\nParing and burning, to judge from our own experience, had the effect of\r\nconverting some of the hard limestone brash into lime, in which case it\r\nbroke up by the influences of air and rain, and so restored the lime and\r\nalumina which mostly exist together in limestone, the former of which is\r\nquickly lost in thin soils,—so much so, indeed, that not unfrequently\r\nthe whole depth of soil, even upon a limestone, will often be curiously\r\ndevoid of lime, which is a necessary ingredient in the constitution of a\r\nclover crop.\r\n\r\nAgain, we should conclude that the operation under discussion, from its\r\ndecomposing that dark vegetable matter called _humus_, which is always\r\nfound in large quantities on some of the soils which are called\r\n“_dead_,” from their inability to produce crops, and which often cause\r\nastonishment that such black, nice-looking earth should be unproductive.\r\nNow this soil, though it would favour the growth of some species of\r\npeat-loving plants, as Ling, Heath, &c., is not suitable for clover, as\r\nthe wild plant is curiously absent from peaty positions.\r\n\r\nProfessor Voelcker remarks that “the excess of undecomposed organic\r\nmatters in soils is decidedly injurious to vegetation. Roots, stems, and\r\nother vegetable matters remain buried in the ground for years without\r\nundergoing decomposition, and if we attentively study the subjoined\r\nanalysis of soil in the neighbourhood of Cirencester, well adapted for\r\nburning, we shall see how the _lime_, _alumina_, and _organic matter_\r\nmight be beneficially affected by the process:—\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF SOIL ADAPTED FOR BURNING, BY PROFESSOR VOELCKER.\r\n\r\n  Moisture                                             ·93\r\n  Organic matter                                     10·67\r\n  Oxides of iron and alumina                         13·40\r\n  Carbonate of lime with a little sulphate of lime   23·90\r\n  Carbonate of magnesia                               1·10\r\n  Phosphoric acid                                    trace\r\n  Potash                                               ·38\r\n  Soda                                                 ·13\r\n  Insoluble silicious matter                         49·66\r\n                                                    ------\r\n                                                    100·17”\r\n\r\nThe ashes, however, are obtained by burning a thin slice pared from the\r\nsurface of the land, so that they are derived from surface-soil and\r\nvegetable matter, the latter often yielding a sufficient amount of\r\nphosphoric acid with which to procure a crop, and, what is all important\r\nfor us to consider is, that this phosphorus, the alkalies, and lime, are\r\nrendered by the burning in a state just fitted for the growth of the\r\nplants that are to be grown upon them; whereas, before the process,\r\nthese ingredients were in a measure locked up, so that plants could not\r\ngrow for the want of sustenance; not that it was not in the soil, but\r\nthat it was insoluble. If, then, clover or any other plant had not\r\nsucceeded, it would have been called “clover-sick.”\r\n\r\nThe following analysis of vegetable ashes from a field in the\r\nneighbourhood of Cirencester will well repay attentive consideration, as\r\nillustrating these points:—\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF ASHES FROM PARING AND BURNING, BY PROFESSOR VOELCKER.\r\n\r\n  Moisture and organic matter          9·12\r\n  Oxides of iron and alumina          14·56\r\n  Carbonate of lime                   17·17\r\n  Sulphate of lime                     1·73\r\n  Magnesia                              ·40\r\n  Chloride of sodium                    ·08\r\n  Chloride of potassium                 ·32\r\n  Potash                               1·44\r\n  Phosphoric acid                      1·84\r\n    Equal to bone earth               (3·98)\r\n  Soluble silica (soluble in potash)   8·70\r\n  Insoluble silicious matter          44·64\r\n                                     ------\r\n                                     100·00\r\n\r\nNow, that land so burnt and containing such ingredients would, after the\r\nprocess, refuse to grow clovers we cannot at all believe; but we do know\r\nthat some of the land of a like composition will not grow even a crop of\r\nturnips until prepared as described; and though the taking a subsequent\r\nbarley crop off before the clover would not tend to the improvement of\r\nthe latter, it will be too often because the barley has taken all the\r\navailable manurial matter, so that there is little left for the clover\r\nto feed upon. In such cases we have seen the clover saved by top\r\ndressing. Paring and burning had also a salutary effect upon the clover\r\ncrop in the destruction which it wrought to various insect pests, and\r\nmore especially the wire-worm, which now makes such increasing inroads\r\nupon our crops of wheat and barley, and so afterwards in the clover; so\r\nthat bare patches, often of great extent, will be the consequence in\r\nevery crop in the rotation. Now, these bare patches in the clover crop\r\nare often appealed to as evidence of clover-sickness, whilst we do not\r\nat the same time say that land is wheat-sick or barley-sick.\r\n\r\nInsects, indeed, are yearly becoming more destructive, not only on\r\naccount of the difference in the mode of farming, but greatly from the\r\ndetermined destruction of birds. The food of birds is in general very\r\nmixed, but at one season of the year, when they are breeding, they are\r\nmost industrious destroyers of insects; but it is just at this time that\r\nthey are kept from the crops, exactly when insects are working the most\r\nmischief: hence, then, as the exigencies of a small growing family\r\nbecome more and more pressing, birds are driven to feed their young upon\r\nseeds, fruits, buds, and other vegetable matters, as unsuitable to build\r\nup the constitution of the young bird as bread diet for an infant.\r\n\r\nLet, however, our grand birds of prey be encouraged, instead of being\r\nshot by the keeper as vermin, or knocked over by the prowling\r\nbird-stuffer, in order to be perched up in a box for sale to some\r\nCockney, who would fain be considered as fond of sport because his\r\n“den,” perchance, contains a stuffed owl, hawk, magpie, or some other\r\n_specimen_.\r\n\r\nOn a recent visit to Dorsetshire, on our own farm, we saw a man employed\r\nto “keep the birds” from a field where several labourers were engaged\r\nbarley sowing; and it is quite true that, unless he had been there, the\r\nrooks would have as industriously followed the drill as they do the\r\nplough; but, as we thought, scarcely to pick up barley in the breeding\r\nseason, when there was metal more attractive in the recently-hatched\r\n_Elater obscurus_, parent of the wireworm, which were thicker than we\r\never saw them before, and, doubtless, the disturbance of the soil\r\nbrought these and two or three generations of wireworms to the surface.\r\nNow, we do not hesitate to give as our opinion that this birdkeeper\r\nwould have done more good to the barley and the succeeding clover crop\r\nby picking up a hundred or two of these beetles and destroying them than\r\nby blazing away at rooks for a twelvemonth, and this certainly might\r\nhave been done in an hour or two.\r\n\r\nStill, that some soils do get incapable of growing a clover crop is\r\npretty certain; and it may, we think, be equally settled that this does\r\nnot entirely depend upon their having been exhausted of the ingredients\r\nwhich analysis demonstrates clover to contain, for we certainly have\r\nseen clover succeed after the burning of so-called clover-sick land; and\r\nthough there is reason to think that this result was partially due to\r\nthe setting free of a fresh supply of manurial ingredients, we are still\r\nconvinced that the burning out of humus or peaty vegetable matter and\r\nthe destruction of insects had their share in the induced change.\r\n\r\nStill, however much we may suppose that the failure of the clover crop\r\nis influenced by the alteration of its constitution as the result of\r\ncultivation, the presence of choking weeds, or by the presence of\r\nprejudicial ingredients, especially in thin soils, there can be no doubt\r\nthat the principal cause of the difficulty will be found in the fact\r\nthat the corn crop with which the clover is grown exhausts the soil, in\r\nthe most unsparing manner, of the very chemical ingredients which the\r\nclover requires.\r\n\r\nThus, if sheep are folded on a crop of turnips, the whole of this crop\r\nis converted into a manure at once available for the grain crop, by\r\nwhich it is quickly appropriated and then taken away. Here, then, we may\r\nsuppose at starting that the clover is half starved; and, with a\r\nconstitution drawn up in the effort of the plants to obtain a glance of\r\nsunshine, and weakened for the want of nourishment, it is expected to\r\nbear our inclement winters.\r\n\r\nThis argument will be made all the clearer if we place side by side the\r\nresult of the analyses of barley and clovers, and especially if we\r\nconsider what a quantity of mineral matter is taken in a short time, and\r\nby a crop ripening its straw and seed.\r\n\r\nNow, if we look at these figures we shall see how much of the mineral\r\nmatter required for the clover has been previously abstracted by the\r\nbarley, and if at the same time we reflect that this robbery may, and\r\ntoo often does, co-exist with the other causes which we have instanced\r\nas tending to clover-sickness, we should no more call land sick of\r\nclover because it will not bear this crop under our exhaustive system of\r\ncultivation than we should call a barren sand wheat-sick for refusing to\r\ngrow corn.\r\n\r\nANALYSES OF BARLEY AND CLOVER.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+-----------------++-----------------+\r\n  |                      |    PLAYFAIR     ||       WAY.      |\r\n  |                      +--------+--------++--------+--------+\r\n  |                      | Barley | Barley ||  Red   |  White |\r\n  |                      | Grain. | Straw. || Clover.| Clover.|\r\n  +----------------------+--------+--------++--------+--------+\r\n  |Silica                |  28·97 |  46·30 ||  3·34  |  3·68  |\r\n  |Phosphoric acid       |  35·68 |   3·22 ||  6·35  | 11·53  |\r\n  |Sulphuric acid        |   1·22 |   2·61 ||  4·18  |  7·21  |\r\n  |Carbonic acid         |        |        || 16·93  | 18·03  |\r\n  |Lime                  |   3·06 |   7·59 || 35·39  | 26·41  |\r\n  |Magnesia              |   8·04 |   3·55 || 11·22  |  8·15  |\r\n  |                      |and loss|and loss||        |        |\r\n  |Peroxide of iron      |   1·94?|   4·35?||  0·97  |  1·96  |\r\n  |Potash                |  15·61 |  22·17 || 14·85  | 14·33  |\r\n  |Soda                  |   5·03 |   0·84 ||  1·40  |  3·72  |\r\n  |Chloride of sodium    |   0·45 |   9·37 ||  2·36  |  4·94  |\r\n  |Chloride of potassium |        |        ||  2·96  |        |\r\n  |                      | ------ | ------ || -----  | -----  |\r\n  |                      | 100·00 | 100·00 || 99·95  | 99·96  |\r\n  +----------------------+--------+--------++--------+--------+\r\n\r\nWe cannot better conclude this chapter than by quoting the following\r\nfrom Baron Liebig’s _Letters on Modern Agriculture_, so ably translated\r\nby Professor Blyth:—\r\n\r\n     The simplest peasant has sense enough to see, and all\r\n     agriculturists agree with him, that clover, turnips, hay, &c.,\r\n     cannot be sold off from a farm without most materially damaging the\r\n     cultivation of the corn. Every one willingly admits that the sale\r\n     and exportation of clover, turnips, &c., exercise a detrimental\r\n     influence on the growing of corn. “Above all, let us take care to\r\n     have plenty of fodder; the corn crop will then take care of\r\n     itself.” But that the _exportation of corn_ may possibly exercise\r\n     an injurious influence on the cultivation of clover or turnips;\r\n     that it is, above all, indispensable to restore to the soil the\r\n     mineral constituents of the corn, to enable the clover or turnip\r\n     crop to “take care of itself;” in other words, that in order to\r\n     grow clover, turnip, &c., we must manure the land—this is a notion\r\n     utterly incomprehensible, nay absolutely impossible, for most\r\n     agriculturists. For, is not the clover grown for the sake of\r\n     manure? What advantage, then, would there be if it were necessary\r\n     to manure again to produce the clover? _This clover the farmer\r\n     expects to grow for nothing._\r\n\r\n     The mutual relations existing in the order of nature between the\r\n     two classes of plants are, however, as clear as daylight. The\r\n     mineral constituents of the clover, turnips, &c., and of the corn,\r\n     form the conditions for the production of the clover, turnips, &c.,\r\n     and of the corn, and they are in their elements quite identical.\r\n     The clovers, &c., require for their growth a certain amount of\r\n     phosphoric acid, potash, lime, magnesia,—so does the corn. The\r\n     mineral constituents contained in the clover are the same as those\r\n     in the corn, _plus_ a certain excess of potash, lime, and sulphuric\r\n     acid. The clover draws these constituents from the soil; the cereal\r\n     plant receives them,—we may so represent it from the clover. In\r\n     selling his clover, therefore, the farmer removes from his land the\r\n     conditions for the production of corn. If, on the other hand, he\r\n     sells his corn, there will be no clover crop in the following year;\r\n     _for in his corn he has sold some of the most essential conditions\r\n     for the production of a clover crop_.—pp. 183-5.\r\n\r\nThis discussion, then, upon the so-called clover-sickness leads us to\r\nadopt the following propositions:—\r\n\r\nFirst. That the larger induced plant of our cultivated clovers has not,\r\nas a rule, that perennial constitution of the smaller wild species.\r\n\r\nSecond. Even its induced habit is much deteriorated by transportation\r\nunder adverse climatal circumstances.\r\n\r\nThird. The seed itself is often full of weeds, which, by gaining the\r\nmastery, kill out the young clover plant.\r\n\r\nFourth. This effect is enhanced by growing clover with barley, in which,\r\nif not smothered, it must become weakened.\r\n\r\nFifth. We ought not to expect to grow clover where we have taken away\r\nthe necessary substances for its growth in the corn crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nON THE WEEDS OF CLOVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat clover crops are often very full of weeds every farmer must be\r\nfully aware, but few among them have used sufficient penetration to have\r\ndiscovered the source of most of the weed growth, not only in clovers,\r\nbut in other crops: how much, then, may they be expected to be\r\nastonished if told that they cultivate weeds by sowing their seeds as\r\ncarefully as they do those of their crops, and that they pay the same\r\nprice for weed as for crop seeds!\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1859 we published the results of some analyses of the\r\nweed admixtures in several samples of different kinds of clover seeds,\r\nwhich we annex (table 1, p. 149), adding to them some further results\r\nobtained during the present spring, 1863, by way of comparison.\r\n\r\nThis presents a formidable array of figures, as it shows how much of\r\nmore than mere harmless matter is purchased and sown instead of good\r\nseed; and the fact of the mischief likely to accrue from putting so many\r\nenemies in the place of friends will become all the more plain by a\r\ncareful study of the next table (No. 2, p. 150).\r\n\r\nNow, in order to make this part of our argument still more complete, we\r\nadd another table (No. 3, p. 150), intending to show the number of weed\r\nplants absolutely separated from a single square yard of old seeds\r\ntaken from a field on the great oolite rock.\r\n\r\n1.

---+--------------------------+------------------------+----+----+----\r\n\r\nThese three fields are situate on the Agricultural College Farm, the\r\nsubstrata of which are forest marble and great oolite, and 2 and 3 were\r\nabsolutely adjoining each other. How different, then, are the species of\r\nwild plants in fields so close together, when out of a list of\r\nsixty-four species only twenty-four, or a little more than one-third,\r\nare common to all three of the fields examined; and yet we can safely\r\naffirm that the aboriginal flora of any three fields of the district\r\nwould scarcely offer half a dozen species in the one field that could\r\nnot be found in all; and, indeed, in a field that had lain fallow for\r\nseveral years not half of the present list would be found.\r\n\r\nThat these, then, have to a great extent been sown with the seed is\r\nquite certain; but what tends further to strengthen the argument is,\r\nthat the _Veronica Buxbaumii_ (Buxbaum’s Speedwell) and the\r\n_Petroselinum segetum_ (Corn Parsley) are not native to the farm; and,\r\nindeed, it is doubtful whether very many of our agrarian weeds are true\r\nnatives, as on examination many weeds will only be found in special\r\ncrops, and these occur in the same crops all over the world wherever\r\nthose crops can be cultivated. Our own country, then, has, doubtless,\r\nimported a large portion of her weed flora from abroad, just as we have\r\ntraced in the United States, European (not American) plants, tracking\r\nthe settlers from England, Ireland, and Scotland. It is thus that the\r\nEuropean daisy (_Bellis perennis_) has got the name of the “White Man’s\r\nFoot.”\r\n\r\nSeeing, then, that the clover seeds are so liable to be dirty, it\r\nbecomes an important inquiry as to whether it is possible to get pure\r\nseed; and in reply to this query we should answer, from a long\r\nexperience, that though one seldom sees pure clover seed, yet it\r\nsometimes falls in our way, or at least so pure that its weeds are\r\nreduced to a minimum. Such samples may be expected to be high-priced;\r\nbut still, how much cheaper than a dirty article!—for, independently of\r\nhaving only the seed of the crop you wish to cultivate, you are saved\r\nthe annoyance which must arise when a weed has taken root, in that then\r\nthe clover cannot grow, and you ultimately see the ground occupied by a\r\nspreading noxious plant, or, this dying out, there will be a vacant\r\nspot,—in either case resulting in a loss of nutriment.\r\n\r\nBut, besides the more natural method of selling dirty seed from weedy\r\npatches, seedsmen are too apt to mix the seed of plantain (_Plantago\r\nlanceolata_) with that of clover; for, as the colours of the seeds are\r\nnot unlike, and some people speak favourably of plantain as a\r\nsheep-feed, it is unblushingly mixed and sold with clover seed, though\r\nthe plantain at most is only worth about half the price.\r\n\r\nWhere it occurs naturally amongst clovers, it may be separated to make a\r\ngood sample, but only to be ultimately mixed again and sold to\r\ngreenhorns with a cheap sample. We have had before us samples of clover\r\ncontaining plantain as under:—\r\n\r\n5.

Both\r\nof these, some few years since, were comparatively rare as farm pests;\r\nbut as they are probably more abundant on Continental than on our home\r\nfarms, they are greatly increasing from the constant influx of foreign\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUSCUTA—_Dodder_.\r\n\r\nOf the genus _Cuscuta_ we have two species of agricultural\r\nimportance,—_Cuscuta epilinum_, the Flax Dodder, and _C. trifolii_, the\r\nClover Dodder. In both, the plant itself consists of a mass of pink and\r\nyellowish tendrils, upon which are placed here and there compact bunches\r\nof flowers varying alike in colour. The whole plant, in both species,\r\nbeing entirely parasitic—that is, it lives wholly on the juices of its\r\nfoster-parent,—it has no leaves of its own; still, however, the Dodder\r\nplant is in the first instance produced from seed, each flower being\r\nsucceeded by a capsule containing two small wrinkled seeds, which, not\r\nbeing larger or lighter in the _C. epilinum_ than a linseed, or in the\r\nstill smaller seed of the clover, in the case of the _C. trifolii_, the\r\nseed of flax or clover crops affected with dodder will never be entirely\r\nfree from it: as an evidence of its large increase, we remember once\r\nseeing a crop of flax grown from Riga seed diminished about\r\none-twentieth by the dodder; but on the seed so produced being sown in\r\nanother field of the same farm, the crop of flax was well-nigh\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nOur friend Professor Voelcker had some seed of the flax dodder sent to\r\nhim for analysis, the reason being that, as his correspondent had\r\nseparated a great number of bushels of this weed pest from a single crop\r\nof flax, he was desirous of ascertaining whether it possessed any\r\nfeeding properties or the reverse; and on this head it is satisfactory\r\nto learn that it is considered useless, though innocuous.\r\n\r\nIt was part of this sample with which we experimented on the mode of\r\ngrowth of dodder, which, although being the dodder of the flax or\r\nlinseed plant, yet its natural history will doubtless be that of the\r\nclover dodder;[8] we shall, therefore, describe the progress of our\r\nexperiments, and their results.\r\n\r\n[8] We are desirous of instituting special experiments on the growth of\r\nclover dodder, but have failed to procure ripe seed, the reason being\r\nthat the seed does not ripen after the clover has been cut down for its\r\nfirst crop.\r\n\r\nHaving prepared some finely-sifted soil in a garden saucer, we sowed a\r\nsmall quantity of flax seed with which had been purposely mixed a few of\r\nthe seeds of flax dodder; this, on being placed in a hot-house, showed\r\nthe progress indicated in the diagram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A. Seed-covering beneath which _radicle_ or young root is\r\npushing.\r\n\r\nB. Leafless stem or tendril growing upwards, bearing seed-covering on\r\nits apex.\r\n\r\nC. Young thread-like plant freed from seed-covering, on the look-out for\r\na foster-parent.\r\n\r\nD. Not finding a foster-parent, droops and dies.]\r\n\r\nOur next diagram shows the progress of dodder-growth when the parasite\r\nhas germinated sufficiently near to a young flax plant to be attracted\r\nto it. In such case, instead of dying, it seems all at once to be\r\nanimated by new vigour. The highly elastic thread, which now represents\r\nthe whole dodder plant, goes through the following stages:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A. The dodder, having just clasped a flax plant, has made\r\ntwo coils round the stem of the latter.\r\n\r\nB. Meanwhile the flax in growing lifts the dodder out of the soil.\r\n\r\nC. While the flax is getting still taller, the dodder sends out\r\nrootlets, which pierce and fix themselves into the flax. During this the\r\ndodder sends out buds upwards, which, elongating until new flax plants\r\nare met with, explains not only how the dodder commences a growth quite\r\nindependent of the soil, but, by spreading, from plant to plant, thus\r\nincreases to an indefinite extent.]\r\n\r\nIn this way, then, the dodder of flax, commencing from seeds at\r\ndifferent points, spreads in more or less extended patches, which, if\r\nsuch centre be few, will be distinct; if many, the pest may occupy the\r\ngreater part of the crop by spreading, and so becoming confluent.\r\n\r\nSuch is the method of growth of flax dodder, and we have no doubt but\r\nthat the dodder of the clover progresses in like manner; at all events,\r\nwe see the latter occupying more or less isolated patches in the\r\naffected crop; and in this case, as in the former, the crop-plant is not\r\nonly starved, from having “its verdure sucked out,” but it is borne down\r\nto the ground and ruined.\r\n\r\nAs regards its destruction, we should be careful to look at our crops in\r\ntheir early growth, as, if the sickly-looking, wire-like tendril be\r\nobserved then, it is easily removed by hand; if, however, it has made\r\nhead, the best way would be to make a trench of a foot wide around the\r\nplague-spots, which will prevent its spreading, as the plant must have\r\ncontiguous clovers to twist round if it is to extend; and then burn some\r\nstraw on the dodder plot, and it will be wasted to death. Probably,\r\nhowever, the easiest plan is to depasture the crop,—certainly not to\r\nseed it down—in which case it will be impossible for any dodder seeds to\r\nripen.\r\n\r\nBut here, as in other cases, the evil will be prevented by sowing pure\r\nseed, whether of flax or of clover; and as the dodder is a small, brown,\r\nroundish little seed, so different from that of either crop, there is no\r\ndifficulty in recognizing it where present.\r\n\r\n\r\nOROBANCHE—_Broomrape_.\r\n\r\nThe Broomrape is now becoming a very pernicious clover weed, especially\r\nin lighter soils. We have seen it on clover near Stonehenge so thick as\r\nto have positively spoiled the crop; and we should expect from its\r\nbitter, disagreeable flavour, that if cattle did not universally refuse\r\nto eat it, it might prove mischievous to them.\r\n\r\nThe species which attacks clover is the _Orobanche minor_—Lesser\r\nBroomrape,—which is at once distinguished in a clover field by its\r\nupright brownish spike of dead, dry-looking, lipped flowers; the stem\r\nwithout true leaves, but clothed with small brown leaf-like processes\r\n(_bracts_ of the botanist), which, with the stem, are clothed with\r\nhairs.\r\n\r\nThis plant, which is much larger and very different from the clover, is\r\nparasitic on the principal division of the clover root; so that if the\r\nsoil be carefully removed from the broomrape, it will be found to swell\r\nat the base, into which the clover root may be detected to be fastened,\r\nand a very odd appearance indeed has the small-stemmed clover united to\r\nso comparatively large a parasite.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of the broomrape are so small as scarcely to be detected in a\r\nsample of clover seed; indeed, several may be fastened to a seed as\r\ndust, so that whatever care may be used in the selection of seed will\r\nhardly prevent this pest. Any great injury to the clover crop may be\r\nspeedily stopped by hand-picking the broomrape; for, although it will\r\nsometimes branch up again, it will be much lessened, and the few\r\nsecondary shoots will usually be very weak.\r\n\r\nClovers are attacked by _Epiphytes_—that is, minute fungoid plants\r\ngrowing upon the leaves; but the natural history of these is too obscure\r\nfor a general treatise, nor are they of sufficient interest to the\r\npractical farmer.[9]\r\n\r\n[9] To such as may be interested in the study of the “rusts” of Clover,\r\nand some other plants, we would earnestly recommend a perusal of some\r\nmost interesting papers on the subject, by M. C. Cooke, Esq.,\r\nbeautifully illustrated by Messrs. West & Sowerby, which will be found\r\nin the _Popular Science Review_—a serial which should have a place in\r\nthe house of every country gentleman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Corn.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO GROW GOOD CORN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nNATURE OF CORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy corn, in its enlarged sense, the farmer means all such crops as are\r\ngrown for their seeds; so that all kinds of grain and pulse, such as\r\npeas and beans, belong to the corn crop, as distinguished from roots and\r\ngreen crops. In America the word “corn” is restricted to maize or Indian\r\ncorn, and other crops are called after their respective names. Our\r\ndictionaries define corn as “seeds which grow in ears, not pods;” and it\r\nis to these that the present treatise is meant exclusively to apply,\r\nconfining our remarks for the most part to such kinds as are more\r\ncommonly cultivated in this country.\r\n\r\nCorn, then, may be said to be derived from different species of grasses,\r\nwhose seeds are sufficiently large to enable them to be threshed from\r\nthe ear and become stored as grain, in which case it differs from the\r\nsmaller kinds, whose seeds may be grown for pasturage crops.\r\n\r\nHence, then, grasses afford us two sets, which are differently\r\nused,—one, as affording corn fabled to be the gift of the goddess\r\nCeres, and so called cereal or corn grasses; the other, not grown for\r\nthe sake of the grain, but for herbage, and named meadow and pasture\r\ngrasses.\r\n\r\nCorn grasses, then, belong exclusively to arable cultivation; and,\r\nindeed, it may be concluded that such have been derived from wild\r\nspecies, and that continued culture has brought them about, and still\r\nmaintains them in all their endless varieties, and also gives us a power\r\nto add to these to an extraordinary extent.\r\n\r\nIt is this facility for improvement, this capability for forming grain\r\non the one hand, and running into varieties on the other, which enables\r\ncorn to be grown under so wide a range of temperature and in such varied\r\nand variable climates; and it is a knowledge of the laws affecting these\r\nchanges, and the modes of action in the growth of corn consequent\r\nthereupon, which will constitute “Science and Practice in Corn\r\nCultivation,” and should lead to a knowledge of “How to Grow Good Corn.”\r\n\r\nIn following out this inquiry, we shall, for the most part, confine our\r\nobservations to the following crops:—\r\n\r\n  1. Wheat,  }\r\n  2. Oats,   } Their Origin, Cultivation, Diseases,\r\n  3. Barley, } Enemies, &c. &c.\r\n  4. Rye,    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nWHEAT: ITS ORIGIN AND ACCLIMATIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a popular belief that wheat, in a state fit for food, was a direct\r\ngift to man, and handed down to him unaltered in form, except in so far\r\nas relates to varieties; but if we consider how varied are the details\r\nof this plant, how very different from each other are the more remote\r\nvarieties, and yet how easy it is to fill up the links on the one hand,\r\nor to arrive at equally distinct and yet new forms on the other, we can\r\nonly conclude that wheat, like most, if not all, our vegetable\r\nesculents, is but a _derivative_ plant obtained from a wild form of\r\ngrass, and in very early times brought into cultivation because of the\r\nfacilities for change which it was capable of undergoing.\r\n\r\nNowhere is wheat, as such, found wild; for, although its grain has been\r\ncultivated in all parts of the world, its scattered seeds cannot\r\nmaintain a position for any length of time; for, as it has been obtained\r\nby cultivation, so its derived status can only be maintained by careful\r\nculture, without which there seems reason to believe that cereal wheat\r\nwould indeed become extinct.\r\n\r\nMany botanists had arrived at these or kindred views from observation\r\nand reasoning upon the subject, but it was not until a comparatively\r\nrecent period that we possessed any direct evidence derived from\r\nexperiment: this we now have, and upon it we quote the following from\r\nMr. Bentham, in the _Cyclopædia of Agriculture_, article “Triticum”:—\r\n\r\n     It has never been contended that their original types have become\r\n     extinct, and various, therefore, have been the conjectures as to\r\n     the transformations they may have successively undergone; and as no\r\n     accidental returns towards primitive forms have been observed, we\r\n     have till lately had but little to guide us in these vague\r\n     surmises. Within the last few years, however, the experiments and\r\n     observations of M. Esprit Fabre, of Agde, in the south of France,\r\n     seem to prove a fact which had been more than once suggested, but\r\n     almost always scouted, that our agricultural wheats are cultivated\r\n     varieties of a set of grasses common in the south of Europe, which\r\n     botanists have uniformly regarded as belonging to a different\r\n     genus, named _Ægilops_. The principal character by which the latter\r\n     genus had been distinguished, consisted in the greater fragility of\r\n     the ear, and in the glumes (_i.e._ the chaff-scales) being\r\n     generally terminated by three or four, and the pales by two or\r\n     three points or awns (beards). But M. Fabre has shown how readily\r\n     these characters become modified by cultivation; and, wide as is\r\n     the apparent difference between _Ægilops ovata_ and common wheat,\r\n     he has practically proved their botanical identity; for, from the\r\n     seeds of the _Ægilops_ first sown in 1838, carefully raised in a\r\n     garden soil, and re-sown every year from their produce, he had,\r\n     through successive transformations, by the eighth year (1846)\r\n     obtained crops of real wheat as good as the generality of those\r\n     cultivated in his neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIt was the description of the experiments of M. Fabre, in the _Journal\r\nof the Agricultural Society_, which led us to institute independent\r\ninquiries, to which end, having purchased some seeds of _Ægilops ovata_,\r\nwe sowed them in our experimental garden at Cirencester, in a prepared\r\nplot of five yards square, on a subsoil of forest marble. From this\r\nseeds were selected to carry on the experiments, whilst the mass of the\r\nplants in the plot were allowed to seed and come up spontaneously, which\r\nit did year after year, and so preserved the original type with which\r\nwe started. The preserved seeds were sown in fresh plots year by year,\r\nbut—perhaps owing to the coldness of the soil and the general lower\r\nclimate of the Cotteswolds—progress was only slow at first; however, in\r\nthe warm summer of 1859 our plot of the season had made fresh advances,\r\nwhich will be best understood by an examination of the accompanying\r\ndrawings.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 represents a spikelet of the type of _Ægilops ovata_, introduced\r\ninto our garden in 1855. In this some of the pales have double awns,\r\nothers single ones. Fig. 4, a spikelet of 1859, modified by cultivation.\r\nIn this the awns are single. Fig. 5, a spikelet from an ear of bearded\r\nwheat.\r\n\r\nNow, the close affinity of these three forms must strike any one; but we\r\nfeel justified in concluding that, had not our experiments been\r\nperemptorily stopped, and the results, as far as possible, spoiled from\r\nthe ignorance and jealousy of the new Principal, we should before this\r\nhave arrived at results much more satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe principles of the observed changes will be understood by stating the\r\nfollowing facts.\r\n\r\n_a._ _Ægilops ovata_ has a seed of sufficient size to be called a corn\r\ngrain, and which, though not so large as that of wheat, yet rapidly\r\nimproves by cultivation, which includes selection.\r\n\r\n_b._ The _rachis_ (the part on which the spikelets are placed in the\r\nwild grass) is exceedingly brittle, so that it readily breaks into bits\r\nbelow each spikelet; this brittleness annually gets less under\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n_c._ The wild grass has a trailing habit of growth; but uprightness and\r\na longer culm is at once induced by the closer contact of drilling the\r\nseeds in thick rows.\r\n\r\n_d._ The cultivation of _Ægilops_, and especially subjecting it to rich\r\nsoil, produces the same kinds of fungoid attacks as are found with\r\nwheats under like circumstances, as thus:—_Puccinia graminis_ (mildew)\r\nof the leaves and culms; _Uredo rubigo_ (red rust) of the chaff-scales;\r\n_Uredo caries_ (smut or bunt) of the grain.\r\n\r\nNow, all these circumstances seem to point to a similarity in essential\r\nstructure, and a uniformity of habit somewhat remarkable in plants which\r\nat first sight would strike one as being so different; but as these\r\ndifferences between _Ægilops_ and any variety of wheat are often all\r\nscarcely greater than is to be met with on contrasting two known\r\nvarieties of wheat, we may agree in concluding that the evidence\r\nwarrants the assumption that wheat, as a cultivated cereal, has been\r\nderived from _Ægilops_.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we view the wheat plant as a derivative, we shall be at no\r\nloss in understanding how the vast number of varieties have been brought\r\nabout—varieties applicable, too, to a wide range of climatal conditions;\r\nand the ease with which new forms can be brought about by hybridization\r\nand selection is a matter of importance, because older varieties, too\r\noften repeated, are apt to degenerate both in quality of grain and\r\nquantity of crop. But when we speak of acclimatizing wheat, we think it\r\nwould be excessively difficult to make any existing form grow well in a\r\nclimate not congenial to it, though it might be easy to arrive at a new\r\nvariety possessing some desired quality. We believe, however, that it is\r\nnot difficult to alter a climate to suit a sort, and, in all\r\nprobability, this at the present day much-used term of “acclimatization”\r\nsimply means no more than making our cultivation and climate accord as\r\nnearly as possible to the habits of the plant or animal to be\r\nentertained under new conditions.\r\n\r\nThus, when we see the finer white wheats growing good crops on farms\r\nwhere such would have been impossible a few years ago, we are hardly to\r\nconclude that we have at length got this more delicate sort to become\r\nmore hardy; but the climate has been ameliorated by draining and better\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nWe distinctly recollect when the lias clays of the Vale of Gloucester\r\ncould scarcely be made to grow a good crop of even the hardier sorts of\r\nred wheat, the common cone being the sort generally grown. This was\r\nsucceeded by many sorts of red wheat, and now only the best-cultivated\r\nfarms produce white wheats. These, however, are facts which will be more\r\nstrongly brought out when we consider the subject of cultivation; for\r\nthe present we would be content with the expression of a belief that\r\nwheat, as a cereal grain, is derived by cultivation from a wild grass,\r\nand it is due to the effects of cultivation that we have so many sorts,\r\nwith such variable adaptability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE WILD OAT AS THE ORIGIN OF THE CULTIVATED VARIETIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrop oats, like wheat, have ever been considered as a direct gift from\r\nCeres, and few, indeed, amongst scientific men were willing to believe\r\nthat they were derived from a wild and weed species. Still, the farmer\r\nhad long maintained that oats, when cultivated, often left behind them\r\nweed oats; and in some districts of Worcester, Gloucester, and Warwick,\r\nwe have known men refuse to grow oats as a crop from their fear of\r\nproducing the terrible weed, which, indeed, the wild oat is on all hands\r\nadmitted to be.\r\n\r\nNow, although we by no means wish to advance the theory of\r\ntransmutation, and cannot believe that by any plan barley can be\r\nconverted into oats, or oats into barley, we are yet confident that what\r\nhas been termed _ennobling_, or the producing of a cultivated plant from\r\na wild one, is oftentimes comparatively easy, and in none more so than\r\nin the production of crop oats from the wild species, _Avena fatua_.\r\n\r\nProfessor Lindley, in the article “Avena,” in Morton’s _Cyclopædia of\r\nAgriculture_, suggests that the cultivated oat “is a domesticated\r\nvariety of some wild species, and may be not improbably referred to\r\n_Avena strigosa_, bristle-pointed oat;” but our experiments would show\r\nthat the _Avena fatua_ is the form from which at least the domestic\r\nsorts in general cultivation seem to have sprung.\r\n\r\nThe _Avena fatua_ (wild oat) is an annual grass which almost universally\r\naccompanies agrarian circumstances; that is to say, it seldom, if ever,\r\noccurs in a truly wild aboriginal state, and is therefore not found in\r\nuncultivated tracts, but is the common attendant on tillage, and in some\r\nsoils is a most common and disagreeable weed in various agricultural\r\ncrops, but more especially amid grain, whether of wheat, barley, or\r\noats. Sometimes it is found with beans, peas, and vetches, and, indeed,\r\nit may be said to be a common weed in some districts in any crop from\r\nwhich it has not been eradicated by the hoe—an operation almost\r\nimpossible in grain, as its growth is so much like that of the crop\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIt is a tall grass, rivalling the height of the finest cultivated oat\r\ncrop, from some forms of which, and especially those with a lax panicle,\r\nit is at first not easily distinguished; however, a more careful\r\nexamination and comparison with the so-called _Avena sativa_ (cultivated\r\noat) enables us to make out the following differences:—\r\n\r\n       _Avena fatua, L._                _Avena fatua_, var. _sativa_.\r\n\r\n  The valves of the inner pales,      The valves of the inner pales not\r\n  which adhere to the seeds, thick,   not so coarse as in _A. fatua_,\r\n  and covered with stiff hairs,       and quite devoid of hairs. The\r\n  especially towards the base. The    outer valve with or without an\r\n  external valve has a long stiff     awn, which when present is not so\r\n  awn, which in the ripe seed is      stiff as in the wild plant,\r\n  usually twisted at the lower part,  sometimes twisted at the base,\r\n  and bent at nearly right angles     but seldom bent. Seeds large and\r\n  at about the middle. The grain-     full, forming the grain for which\r\n  seed very small and worthless.      the crop is cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe experiments about to be detailed were performed with the _Avena\r\nfatua_.\r\n\r\nIn 1851, a quantity of this plant was noticed by the author on the farm\r\nof C. Lawrence, Esq., near Cirencester. It was mixed with a patch of\r\nmangel-wurzel which had been planted for seed; and from these specimens\r\nsufficient seeds were preserved wherewith to sow one of our experimental\r\nplots.\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed that the substratum was forest marble, and no doubt\r\nthe seeds of the oat were brought with the manure by which the mangold\r\npatch was dressed.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1852 a plot of two and a half yards square was sown\r\nwith seed which had been kept during the winter—a fact which should be\r\ncarefully noted, as it forms a first and most important link in the\r\nchain of evidence, and constituting what we term a cultivative process,\r\ninasmuch as in wild growth the seeds are sown as soon as they become\r\nripe.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of the first crop came up well, and on ripening, towards\r\nautumn, the plants were tall and robust; the grains presented a scarcely\r\nappreciable difference from the wild examples; if any, there may have\r\nbeen a slight tendency to an increased plumpness of grain.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of crop No. 1 were again collected and preserved throughout\r\nthe winter, and sown in a patch of similar size, but in a different part\r\nof the garden, in the spring of 1853, repeating the process with the\r\nsuccessive crops in 1854 and 1855, with slight alterations from year to\r\nyear, though in some examples the following tendencies seemed from the\r\nfirst to be gaining strength in some few of the specimens:—\r\n\r\n1st. A gradual decrease in the quantity of hairs on the pales.\r\n\r\n2nd. A more tumid grain, in which the pales were less coarse and the awn\r\nnot so strong and rigid, and less black than in the wild example.\r\n\r\n3rd. A gradual increased development of kernel or flower.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of 1855 crop, without selection, were treated in the same\r\nmanner during the winter, and were sown in the spring of 1856, the\r\nresulting crop in August of the same year presenting the following\r\ncurious circumstances:—\r\n\r\n1st. _Avena fatua_ (typical wild oat), with large loose panicles of\r\nflowers,[10] thin hairy florets, with a bent awn twisted at the base.\r\nFive parts of crop.\r\n\r\n[10] Some examples of this plant, gathered at Framilode, in the Vale of\r\nGloucester, in the past autumn, gave as many as 750 seeds to a root,\r\nfrom which its rate of increase as a weed may be imagined.\r\n\r\n2nd. _Avena fatua_, var. _sativa_, with loose panicles of flowers,\r\nflorets quite smooth, tumid, with or without straight awns, some few\r\nexamples slightly hairy towards the base. This is the potato-oat type.\r\nSix parts of crop.\r\n\r\n3rd. _Avena fatua_, var. _sativa_—Panicles more compact, flowers\r\ninclining to one side, grains more tumid than 2nd, quite devoid of\r\nhairs, awn straight. These present the type of the white Tartarian oat.\r\nTwelve parts of crop. Fig. 2. See plate.\r\n\r\nHaving now procured a crop of separate types of oat from the same seed,\r\nwe preserved them distinct, and this year carried on our experiments by\r\ncultivating a patch of each, whilst the plot of 1856 was left with\r\nself-sown seeds, in order that it should again become wild by\r\ndegeneracy.\r\n\r\nFrom these experiments, then, we may conclude that different types of\r\ncrop oats are derived from the _Avena fatua_, or wild oat; but, besides\r\nthis, they open out a subject for inquiry of great practical interest\r\nand importance, which may be clearly stated as follows:—\r\n\r\nIf by cultivation the wild oat assumes the cultivated form, then by\r\ndegeneracy cultivated oats may become wild ones.\r\n\r\nThose who know what a detestable weed is the wild oat wherever it\r\noccurs, and how difficult it is to eradicate,[11] will at once see the\r\ncogency of the question involved.\r\n\r\n[11] The author once went with a rector of a parish in Gloucestershire\r\nto examine the glebe allotments of the poor people, when, catching sight\r\nof an apparent crop of oats, the landlord threatened to dispossess the\r\ntenant, “because he had carelessly left his crop without gathering.”\r\nHowever, the matter was explained when it was pointed out that the land\r\nwas planted with wheat, which the oats had quite smothered.\r\n\r\nFarmers in some districts, and more especially on stiff clay soils, have\r\never objected to the cultivation of oats, as they had always maintained\r\nthat they left behind a crop of weed oats. This, which was never a\r\nfavourite idea with the botanist, who is generally too much inclined to\r\nspecies-making, seems now to have a basis of truth, for not only is it\r\nconfirmed by the experiments described, but observation of an\r\nindependent kind points to the same truth.\r\n\r\nOn examining the produce of shed, or accidentally scattered oat seeds,\r\nthe first crop will often present the wild tendency in a partial\r\nreversion to the hairy state, an elongation and thickening of the awn,\r\nand a lessening of the size of the kernel; and this more particularly on\r\nheavy soils. It was, indeed, an observation of this change in oats\r\nscattered on forest marble clay which induced us to try the experiments\r\nabove detailed; and as the subsoil of our botanical garden is the same\r\nclay, we are, perhaps, indebted to this cause for arriving so soon at\r\nsuch signal results.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is known in farming that some clay lands will never produce\r\nheavy oats; a sample, however good, is sure to degenerate upon such\r\nsoils. Hence, then, the foregoing experiments and observations lead to\r\nthe following conclusions:—\r\n\r\n1st. The wild oat is perhaps not a native of Britain, but derived\r\nthrough the degeneracy of the cereal crop; and hence its occurrence only\r\nas an agrarian.\r\n\r\n2nd. The cereal oat, on the contrary, is the result of the impress of\r\ncultivative processes upon the wild form, and as such liable to lapse\r\ninto the wild state with greater or less celerity, according to the\r\ncircumstances of soil and situation.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions are of practical value, as they show the direction in\r\nwhich experiments should be conducted in order to attain to varieties,\r\nit being a well-known fact that one variety is suitable for one soil,\r\nand another for a different kind of land. And again, as some forms of\r\nplants would seem to have the tendency of wearing out by long\r\ncultivation, so we have the means of applying to the original source of\r\ntheir production, and thus of commencing a new generation.\r\n\r\nThey teach us, too, the necessity of avoiding the growth of the oat crop\r\nin some situations, and which in the case before us is not the result of\r\nthe “pigheadedness” with which the farmer is often so thoughtlessly\r\naccused, but a conclusion founded in reason; and if we consider how\r\nrobust is the growth of the wild oat, and that its support is secured by\r\nrobbing the grain crop with which it occurs as a weed—the difficulty of\r\nseparating it from the crop where it has gained a footing—and, above\r\nall, that its succession is secured by its seeds universally ripening a\r\nfew days before that of the crop with which it is mixed, and the moment\r\nthey are ripe they fall and become self-sown,[12]—we can see abundant\r\nreason for wholesome fear as to the introduction of cereal oats in\r\ndistricts liable to their degeneracy.\r\n\r\n[12] The wild forms shed their seeds much more readily than the\r\ncultivated ones, and are, besides, earlier in ripening, and thus much of\r\nour wild seed had dropped before the other forms were fully ripe; and it\r\nmuch assists experiments in transmutation not to let the seeds with\r\nwhich they are to be carried on become dead ripe. This is another\r\ncultivative process.\r\n\r\nThe annexed enlarged figure of a bunch of wild oat seeds will\r\nsufficiently illustrate the changes necessary to produce the cultivated\r\nform.\r\n\r\nUnder cultivation, which supposes the _selection, saving up, and sowing\r\nin a prepared_ bed of our seed, the wild oat seed gradually becomes\r\nsmooth externally, and its awn less coarse, while internally the grain\r\nbecomes larger and heavier; so that while the seed of the wild oat would\r\nweigh about 15 lb. per bushel, that of a fine sample of white cultivated\r\noat sown on our farm this year weighed as much as 48 lb. per bushel.\r\n\r\nNow, the proof of this theory consists in the facts—\r\n\r\n1st. That heavy oats degenerate by being _cultivated_ in poor soil.\r\n\r\n2nd. By _being let go wild_, they sink still lower, and gradually assume\r\nthe external hairs, stiff awns, and poor grain of the wild oat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Spikelet of the Wild Oat._[13]]\r\n\r\n[13] From _Popular Science Review_, vol. i. p. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nON THE SUPPOSED ORIGIN OF BARLEY AND RYE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cereal barley is found to offer three important forms, which can be\r\nbest explained by the annexed diagramatic arrangement:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n_Two-rowed—by abortion of four_\r\n\r\n_Four-rowed—by abortion of two_\r\n\r\n_Six-rowed—by fruition of all_\r\n\r\n_the seeds of a spikelet._]\r\n\r\nThe two-rowed barley has been named _Hordeum distichum_; and as we are\r\ninclined, with Professor Lindley, to the belief that this is the\r\noriginal from whence the other forms have sprung, we here quote the\r\nlearned Professor’s remarks upon this and the probably allied forms:—\r\n\r\n     “It is probable,” he says, “that all kinds of barley grown by\r\n     farmers are varieties of one species, of which, the _H. distichum_\r\n     of Linnæus is the type. The spikelets of this genus always standing\r\n     in threes, and the threes being placed back to back, it is evident\r\n     that every ear of barley must consist of six rows of spikelets. If\r\n     the middle spikelet of each set of threes is alone perfect, the\r\n     side spikelets being abortive, we have _H. distichum_, the common\r\n     two-rowed barley, and its many varieties; if the two-tuberal of\r\n     each set is perfect, and the central spikelet imperfect, as\r\n     sometimes happens, then we have four-rowed barley; if, on the other\r\n     hand, all the spikelets are perfect, we have six-rowed barley, or\r\n     _H. hexastichum_; but the cases of four-rowed barley have been\r\n     merely accidental—they may be referred to the six-rowed form; and\r\n     thus we have only two principal kinds of barley—namely, _H.\r\n     distichum_ and _H. hexastichum_.\r\n\r\n     “1. _H. distichum._—This is the only kind of barley that has been\r\n     found apparently wild. We have now before us specimens gathered in\r\n     Mesopotamia during Col. Chesney’s expedition to the Euphrates, with\r\n     narrow ears, a little more than an inch long, exclusive of the awn,\r\n     or four and a half inches awns included; and others from the ruins\r\n     of Persepolis, with ears scarcely so large as starved rye. Both are\r\n     straw-colour, but that from Mesopotamia has the glumes much more\r\n     hairy than the other. The plant is also said to inhabit Tartary.\r\n     The report that it grows wild in Sicily seems to have arisen from\r\n     the Mediterranean _Ægilops ovata_ having been mistaken for it. To\r\n     this species belong all the varieties, from one to sixteen,\r\n     formerly mentioned under Barley; as also does No. 20, fig.\r\n     34[14]—the _H. zeocriton_, sprat or battledore barley, an undoubted\r\n     result of domestication, chiefly remarkable for the ears being so\r\n     much broader at the base than the point as to produce a long ovate\r\n     figure.\r\n\r\n[14] See Morton’s _Cyclopædia of Agriculture_.\r\n\r\n     “2. _H. hexastichum._—We found no record of this having been found\r\n     wild, and presume it and its numerous varieties to be domesticated\r\n     forms of _H. distichum_. The common bere, or winter barley, may be\r\n     taken as the typical form to which Nos. 18, 21, and 22, and figs.\r\n     37 and 38[15] are evidently referable, varying in size, colour, and\r\n     hairiness, more than in any other circumstance deserving botanical\r\n     appreciation.\r\n\r\n[15] Ibid.\r\n\r\n     “The _H. vulgare_ of Linnæus is a form with the grains in four\r\n     rows, the naked-eared variety of which is again the _H. cœleste_ of\r\n     some writers.\r\n\r\n     “Both these forms of barley vary with naked seed, the pales losing\r\n     their adhesion to the grain. But this difference is attended with\r\n     no other peculiarity.\r\n\r\n     “3. The _H. trifurcatum_, also known under Dr. Royle’s name of _H.\r\n     ægiceras_, is a very remarkable naked-seeded species, with much the\r\n     appearance of wheat. It is a tall or glaucous six-rowed sort, but\r\n     the rows are not placed in lines with the same exactness as in the\r\n     two former kinds, so that the ears are round like wheat. The pales\r\n     are apparently in a monstrous form, the ends being three-lobed, and\r\n     curved back in the form of horns, which sometimes extend into awns.\r\n     It has been introduced from the Himalaya Mountains within a few\r\n     years, but its economical qualities remain to be determined.”[16]\r\n\r\n[16] _Cyclopædia of Agriculture_, vol. ii. p. 68.\r\n\r\nWe have had opportunities, through the kindness of Professor Lindley,\r\nwho contributed seeds, of cultivating all the forms just described; but\r\nour experiments for two years did not elicit anything new upon the\r\nsubject: we therefore feel justified in quoting the above entire,\r\nespecially as the different forms in our plots afforded sufficient\r\nevidence of an uniformity of origin on the one hand, with every\r\ndisposition for forming varieties on the other.\r\n\r\nRye (_Secale cereale_).—For the little that is known of the natural\r\nhistory and origin of this crop-plant we again quote from the\r\n_Cyclopædia of Agriculture_, which states as follows:—\r\n\r\n     “The common rye is a cereal grass, distinguished from wheat by its\r\n     narrow glumes and constantly twin narrow florets, with a membranous\r\n     abortion between them. Otherwise it is little different in\r\n     structure, although the quality of its grain is so inferior.\r\n     According to Karl Koch, it is found undoubtedly wild on the\r\n     mountains of the Crimea, especially all around the village of\r\n     Dshimil, on granite, at the elevation of from 5,000 to 6,000 feet.\r\n     In such places, its ears are not more than 1 to 2½ inches long. Its\r\n     native country explains the reason why it is so much hardier than\r\n     any variety of wheat, the southern origin of which is now\r\n     ascertained.”\r\n\r\nWe have not seen any of this so-called wild rye; it would, however, be\r\nof great service could some good experiments be made with it, with a\r\nview of noting the changes which take place on cultivation. Indeed, we\r\nhave long wished for authentic examples of all our wild, or supposed\r\nwild, cereals, with a view of examining side by side the nature and\r\namount of the changes which cultivation would most assuredly produce.\r\n\r\nRye, unlike either wheat or barley, is not remarkable for a long list of\r\nvarieties—a fact which may, perhaps, be attributed to the more limited\r\ngrowth of the former than the two latter. Its less extended cultivation\r\nmust be attributed to its inferior qualities as food; for, though rye is\r\nin the main a hardier plant than wheat, and therefore could withstand\r\nthe evils of a colder climate and colder treatment, yet with the\r\nadvanced climate—the acclimatization of a country rather than a\r\nplant—the superior plant, wheat, everywhere prevails; and this cause\r\nalso gives rise to the production of finer varieties, which are thus\r\ngrown where only coarser ones were possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nEPIPHYTICAL PARASITES (VEGETABLE BLIGHTS) OF CORN CROPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese forms of parasite are so numerous, that nearly every species of\r\nflowering plant may become the nidus even of several named genera, with\r\nmany species, or, at least, varieties of them. We here say attacked,\r\nbecause the advent of many of their forms passes under the name of\r\n“blight;” a term which at once recognises their injurious tendency.\r\n\r\nWhether these epiphytes are the causes of the so-called blighted\r\nconditions, or merely their effects, is a subject upon which no little\r\ndiscussion has been expended. We do not, however, mean to re-open the\r\nquestion here; we will only remark, that in all probability this very\r\nwide range of the lower tribes of the vegetable kingdom is very variable\r\nin these respects.\r\n\r\nAgain: it will be impossible to enter into details of the different\r\nspecies of epiphytes. We shall hope, therefore, to elucidate their\r\nnatural history, in so far as the farmer is concerned, by pointing out\r\nthe more general facts connected with the following forms:—\r\n\r\n   1. _Uredo segetum_—Smut or dust-brand of wheat, barley, and grasses.\r\n\r\n   2. _Uredo caries_ (_Tilletia_)—Bunt                }\r\n                                                      }\r\n   3. _Uredo rubigo_—Red gum or red robin             }\r\n                                                      } of wheat.\r\n   4. _Uredo linearis_     }                          }\r\n                           }—Straw-rust, or “mildew”  }\r\n   5. _Puccinia graminis_  }                          }\r\n\r\n   6. _Puccinia fabæ_—Bean-rust.\r\n\r\n   7. _Æcidium berberidis_—Barberry-rust.\r\n\r\n   8. _Cladosporium herbarum_—Corn-ear mould.\r\n\r\n   9. _Botrytis infestans_—Potato-mould and mildew.\r\n\r\n  10. _Botrytis_—Turnip-mildew.\r\n\r\n  11. _Oïdium erysiphioides_ }\r\n                             } Hop-mildew.\r\n  12. _Erysiphe macularis_   }\r\n\r\n  13. _Oïdium abortifaciens_—Ergot of grasses.\r\n\r\n1. _Uredo segetum_, Smut or Dust-brand, is common to barley, and not\r\nunfrequent in wheat; in both of which crops it is easily recognised from\r\nthe affected ears of corn appearing as though they had been powdered\r\nover from the sweep’s soot-bag. On closely examining these blackened\r\nears, we find that the whole flower has, as it were, effloresced into a\r\nblack powder, which, on being placed under the microscope, is shown to\r\nbe composed of myriads of granules, called by the fungologist _spores_,\r\nin which latter are contained still smaller grains, or _sporidia_.\r\n\r\nThese black spores are all washed away by the time the crop is ripe,\r\nleaving the stalks bare and grainless, so that the sample suffers no\r\ninjury from this blight, which, even if present after threshing, would\r\nonly tend to a slight discoloration of the sample, which is remediable\r\nby the smutter. Its chief effect, however, consists in causing the loss\r\nof much grain. We have observed it to the extent of as much as an\r\neighth, but usually the diminution is about equal to the amount of seed\r\nsown; though it is not improbable that the whole crop may in many cases\r\nbe greater when the smut is present. Sheep-folding previous to barley,\r\nspecial manuring for this crop, and other causes of increased fertility,\r\nare constant causes of the increase of the dust-brand.\r\n\r\n2. _Uredo caries_—Bunt, Pepper-brand, Smut-balls.—This blight differs\r\nfrom the preceding in the fact that in the grain no flower is formed,\r\nbut its interior becomes filled with a dark powder, which, when viewed\r\nunder a high magnifying power, is found to consist of granules, with a\r\nsurface which is rough, and not smooth as in the dust-brand.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, the whole grains of the ear will be so affected; in\r\nothers, only a portion of them. They will be gathered in the harvest,\r\nand as the diseased grain is readily crushed, the black powder\r\nmaterially damages the appearance of the sample. Nor is this all: this\r\nblight has a most disagreeable odour and flavour, both of which are\r\ncommunicated to the sample, and so, besides diminishing the amount of\r\nproduce, it greatly deteriorates it. Its specific name of _caries_ of\r\ncourse refers to this fact, as also does that of _U. fœtida_, adopted by\r\nBaur, an author to whom we are greatly indebted for information upon\r\nthese curious productions.\r\n\r\nBefore considering the remedy for this evil, it will be well to\r\ndistinguish it from the “purples, ear-cockle, or peppercorn” (_vibrio\r\ntritici_)—a name expressive of its animal origin, and frequently\r\nrendered “wheat-eels.” In the purples, the grain is shorter than a\r\nhealthy wheat grain, irregular in shape (cockled), and purple\r\nexternally; but its interior is filled with what, to the naked eye, is\r\nlike very short white cotton-wool. On placing a bit of this woolly\r\nsubstance with the point of a needle on a slip of glass, just touching\r\nit with water and submitting it to a high magnifying power, the term\r\n“wheat-eel” will at once be seen to be justified; for, if alive,\r\nthousands of eel-like creatures will be seen writhing in the fluid.\r\n\r\nThe differences of these two affections of wheat may be expressed as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n             _Bunt._                          _Ear-cockle._\r\n\r\n  Grain smooth externally, sometimes  Grain cockled and irregular in\r\n  appearing black from blackened      shape, purple externally, skin\r\n  interior grains showing through     thickened, interior of the grains\r\n  the thin epidermis (bran). These    stuffed with a white cottony\r\n  corns easily crush beneath the      substance, not compressible by\r\n  finger, emitting the black fungi.   the finger; but being opened, and\r\n                                      the interior magnified, exhibits\r\n                                      the living wheat-eels.\r\n\r\nAs regards the ear-cockle, we incline to the belief that a damp\r\natmosphere and cold soil are chiefly concerned in its spread, if not in\r\nits production. As we have shown the difference between it and bunt, we\r\nnow proceed to offer a few remarks upon the production of the latter,\r\nand its remedies.\r\n\r\nBunt is mainly produced by defective seed. It occurs on all kinds of\r\nsoils—sands, clays, and limestones—and is not peculiar to any climate.\r\nProfessor Henslow believes the disease to be wholly propagated by the\r\nspores of the fungus adhering to the wheat-seed. He says, “It has been\r\nclearly proved that wheat plants may be easily infected, and the disease\r\nthus propagated, by simply rubbing the seeds before they are sown with\r\nthe black powder or spores of the fungus. It is also clearly ascertained\r\nthat if seeds thus tainted be thoroughly cleansed, the plants raised\r\nfrom them will not be infected;” and he deduces from this a proof in\r\nfavour of steeping; for he says, “This fact is now so well established,\r\nthat the practice of washing or steeping seed wheat in certain\r\nsolutions almost universally prevails.”[17]\r\n\r\n[17] See an essay on _Diseases of Wheat_, in the _Journal of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society_ for 1841, by the Rev. Professor Henslow.\r\n\r\nOur own experiments, however, recorded in the “Journal of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society” for 1856, led us to conclude that the success\r\nderived from pickling wheat in different caustic and corrosive solutions\r\narose from the fact of diseased grain being destroyed in the process;\r\nand we extract the following record of experiments made in 1853, as\r\nexplaining this view of the matter.\r\n\r\nFour plots of wheat, all from the same sample, were sown in the\r\nfollowing order:—\r\n\r\n          1.               2.              3.               4.\r\n  +---------------++---------------++---------------++---------------+\r\n  | Much diseased || Much diseased;||Perfect picked || Perfect picked|\r\n  |    wheat,     ||  treated with ||     seed,     ||   seed, with  |\r\n  |without pickle.||  sulphate of  ||without pickle.||  sulphate of  |\r\n  |               ||    copper.    ||               ||   copper.     |\r\n  +---------------++---------------++---------------++---------------+\r\n\r\nThe results of these were as under:—\r\n\r\nPlot 1. Most of the seed germinated, but the crop was much blighted,\r\nboth in straw and grain; in fact, scarcely a perfect ear of the latter.\r\n\r\nPlot 2. A small quantity of the seed germinated; the few resulting ears\r\nwere free from blight.\r\n\r\nPlot 3. Germinated, with a good and clean resulting crop.\r\n\r\nPlot 4. The same result as Plot 3.\r\n\r\nThese experiments seemed to show that the pickling of wheat destroys the\r\nseed, so as to prevent germination when the seed is diseased or\r\nill-formed; but if perfect seed be always employed, no pickling at all\r\nis necessary, it being strictly true that a diseased progeny must result\r\nfrom an imperfect stock in plants no less than in animals.\r\n\r\nWe have said that bunt is not peculiar to any climate; we have, however,\r\nalways observed that employing seed from a warm district on a cold one,\r\nor using the finer white wheats in cold, exposed, or ill-drained\r\nsituations, is sure to produce a large quantity of this fungus.\r\nAutumn-sown wheat, too, is less liable to the infection than spring\r\nwheat, which we attribute to the fact that many of the weaker plants\r\nwill succumb to the cold rain and frost.\r\n\r\n3. _Uredo rubigo_ (Red-rust, Red-rag, Red-robin) makes its appearance in\r\nthe inside of the chaff-scales, and ultimately in the green epidermis of\r\nthe growing grains of wheat. Its first appearance is that of oval\r\npustules, caused by the raising of the skin, which, ultimately bursting,\r\nshows the orange-coloured spores of the epiphyte. This must not be\r\nconfounded with _Cecidomyia tritici_ (wheat-midge), the larvæ of which\r\nare of a bright orange-colour; in the latter, the living moving worms\r\nmay be easily detected by any common pocket lens or magnifying glass.\r\nBoth these pests, to which we would apply the distinctive terms of\r\n_Uredo rubigo_ (red-rust) and _Cecidomyia tritici_ (red-gum), are\r\nexceedingly common in some seasons, and not unfrequently in the same\r\ncrop. Good deep cultivation is the best remedy for the rust; but the\r\ntreatment of the fly is a different matter. We would suggest the burning\r\nof smother-heaps on calm days, just as the wheat is bursting into ear,\r\nas smoke is decidedly obnoxious to these small insects, which in some\r\nseasons may be seen in thousands about the bursting wheat.\r\n\r\n4 and 5. _Uredo linearis_; _Puccinia graminis_ (Straw-rust and\r\nMildew).—We refer to these epiphytes under one heading, as there can be\r\nbut little doubt that the latter is a more advanced state of the former.\r\nThey both occur in oblong patches on the leaves and straw of wheats and\r\nother grasses: in the _uredo_ stage, of a dull red colour; in the\r\n_puccinia_ stage, of a blackish hue. They are both, as, indeed, are all\r\nthese fungi, interesting microscopic objects; but our object now is to\r\ndescribe them popularly. Both will always be found in abundance in cold\r\npoor soils, and more especially if the finer wheats be grown in such\r\nsituations. The application of a dressing of salt to the soil is said to\r\nbe a preventive. Be this as it may, the disease is said to be rarer in\r\nCheshire, where salt is so much used by the farmer, than in any other\r\ncounty, in as far as we have observed.\r\n\r\nHere, again, we incline to think that these are morbid affections of the\r\nplant. They are, indeed, viewed as such by Unger, in his “Die Exantheme\r\nPflanzen,” in which the very title classes them with eruptive diseases\r\nof animals. Berkeley and Henslow, the two great authorities, however, do\r\nnot accord with this view: the former remarks in reference to it—“Surely\r\nthese plants are too distinctly, too regularly, and too beautifully\r\norganized to be the products of disease like warts or purulent matter in\r\nanimals.” As, however, the microscope demonstrates that warts and\r\neruptive diseases have also their special and curiously formed\r\norganisms, such a mode of reasoning is not conclusive.\r\n\r\nWeeds have a great influence in producing mildew, which perhaps may be\r\naccounted for from the fact that weeds are in active growth as the\r\nwheat-stalks decline in vigour; and hence the constant evaporation of\r\nmoisture from the weeds to the wheat is continually re-moistening an\r\never-drying surface—a most fertile source of mildew and moulds of\r\nseveral descriptions.\r\n\r\n6. _Puccinia fabæ_ (Bean-rust).[18]—The brown pustular rust-looking\r\nspots on the foliage of beans, and, indeed, occasionally on the stems\r\nand pods of beans, are sometimes common to this crop. They are usually\r\naccompanied by a lessening both in quantity and quality of this pulse,\r\nboth in the garden and in field culture, but certainly more generally in\r\nthe latter. Too gross manuring without well mixing the dung with the\r\nsoil would seem to be a constant source of the evil. In fact, highly\r\nnitrogenized manures appear to favour the development of all this class\r\nof epiphytes, just as too much meat might bring about different forms of\r\nrash or eruptions in the animal. Weeds, which are too much permitted in\r\nbeans, here aid in perfecting the mischief; hence, then, we may perhaps\r\ntake it for granted that the mention of the causes of mischief suggests\r\nthe remedy.\r\n\r\n[18] This blight is mentioned here on account of its affinity to the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n7. _Æcidium berberidis_ (Barberry-rust) is here referred to, from the\r\nopinion prevailing that it is the cause of rust and mildew in wheat. We\r\ncan no more believe that the barberry-rust would produce rust in wheat,\r\nthan the rust of any other plant would do so; for nearly all plants are\r\naffected with some kind or other of rust. This epiphyte, too, is very\r\ndifferent in structure from wheat-rust. Still, that wheat growing under\r\na barberry hedge may be more blighted than in the rest of the field is\r\nquite true; and so it is with wheat grown under any kind of hedge. High\r\nfences are known to favour wheat blights; open, exposed, well-cultivated\r\npositions, when not too elevated, and without trees or hedges, being\r\nthose in which the best wheats are grown.\r\n\r\n8. _Cladosporium herbarum_ (Corn-ear Mould) is a brown-coloured mildew,\r\nmostly occurring on the exterior of the chaff-scales of wheat, but\r\ncommon to many plants in a state of decadence. It consists of greenish\r\nor blackish tufts, which appear on the outside of the chaff-scales of\r\nwheat under the two following conditions:—\r\n\r\nOn wet soils, where the ears appear to have been prematurely starved.\r\n\r\nOn dry sands, where long-continued drought has caused some ears to\r\nwither and die before the seed was fully formed.\r\n\r\nIn both these cases we see that the plant has been previously injured.\r\nThe decay commences under alternations of moisture and drying, and hence\r\nthe fungoid attack. Here, then, the conditions necessary for preventing\r\nwill be deep cultivation and a due pulverization and mixture of the\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\n9-12. _Botrytis_, _&c._ (Mildew).—Under this head we include a multitude\r\nof epiphytes, to which the terms mildew, mealdew, mehlthau (Germ.) are\r\napplicable. They appear to the naked eye as patches of white dust or\r\nmeal on the leaves and stems of the affected plants. With the microscope\r\nwe see that they are beautifully-organized plants, having a kind of\r\nrootlet (mycelium) or spawn entering the tissues of the living plants on\r\nwhich they grow, and delicate pedicels supporting spores at the\r\nexternally visible portion of the plant. The botrytis of the potato and\r\nturnip, the erysiphe or oïdium of the hop, vine, and other plants, are\r\nonly different forms of mildew, which in some shape or another will be\r\nfound on most plants. That these attack living tissues is quite certain;\r\nbut in the case of the potato, the turnip, and the vine, there is reason\r\nto believe that they result, to a very considerable extent, from\r\ndiseased action in their tissues. For example: the botrytis of the\r\npotato seems to attack a crop much over-cultivated, on the approach of\r\nwet and cold nights after a prosperous growth in warm sunshine. So, the\r\noïdium seems to us to be most abundant on renewed growth after a season\r\nof dry weather. Again: mildew in turnips is sure to follow that check\r\nwhich a long season of dry weather brings after a prosperous and\r\nvigorous growth. All these circumstances at least show how these attacks\r\nare favoured by the conditions which bring disease. So much, indeed, is\r\nthis the case, that we found, upon experimenting with some cucumbers in\r\na warm stove, that as long as we regularly watered the plants and gave\r\nthem the requisite air, they kept healthy; but, by neglecting these\r\nconditions for a few days, we obtained mildew with the greatest\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe remedies against mildew are—to obtain as healthy a growth as\r\npossible, and to maintain this with as great regularity as\r\ncircumstances will permit. Of late years, both the mildew of the vine\r\nand the hop have been treated with flowers of sulphur. Dusting the\r\naffected hop-leaves with sulphur certainly arrests the mildew in an\r\nincredibly short time; and we found that by dusting sulphur from a fine\r\nsieve on our cucumber plants, the disease was immediately arrested in\r\nits progress. We therefore look upon this as an invaluable remedy in\r\nthese states of mildew, whether occurring on the vine, the hop, the\r\nturnip, the cucumber, or on other plants, as we have frequently seen it\r\nin hothouses—a circumstance which shows the near affinity of all those\r\nforms of epiphytes, which, perhaps, after all, only vary with the\r\nvariations in the structure and economy of the different plants on which\r\nthey occur.\r\n\r\n13. _Oïdium abortifaciens_ (Ergot); _Secale cornutum_ (Ergot of\r\nRye).—The black horn-looking spur which occurs in rye and other grasses\r\nwas formerly looked upon as a distinct fungus; now, however, it is known\r\nto be a diseased or malformed condition of the grain or seed, resulting\r\nfrom an attack by an oïdium on the immature seed.\r\n\r\nMost of the cereal and even the meadow grasses are liable to attacks of\r\nergot, which is increased by cold damp fogs and a moist condition of the\r\natmosphere, the difference of the size of the spur being in accordance\r\nwith the size of the affected grass seed. Thus, in rye we have seen\r\nspurs more than an inch long, while in the cock’s-foot grass it is\r\nseldom a quarter of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe ergot, as it occurs in the rye, is much used by medical men in\r\ndifficult cases of parturition; and we have had evidence before us, in\r\nsome cases of abortion in cows, that the constant depasturing on grasses\r\naffected with ergot (and the _Lolium perenne_ in aftermaths is often\r\nespecially so) has been the predisposing cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nINSECTS (ANIMAL BLIGHTS) AFFECTING CORN CROPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe different families and species of insects affecting the various\r\nkinds of corn crops in all their stages of growth are so numerous, that\r\na detailed list of them would occupy greater space than we can devote to\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\nIn this position of affairs we have thought it wise to confine our\r\nremarks to some of the commoner and more mischievous species, choosing\r\nthose more particularly which are common to the wheat crop, of which the\r\nfollowing may be at once introduced as a summary in itself sufficient to\r\nshow what the farmer may expect at each stage of growth:—\r\n\r\n  1. { The _Slug_,      } Attacking the plants soon after germination.\r\n     { The _Wire-worm_, }\r\n\r\n  2. { The _Gout Fly_, } That attacks the wheat stems as they begin to\r\n     { The _Saw Fly_,  } form.\r\n\r\n  3. The _Wheat Midge_—Commencing their injuries in the young flower.\r\n\r\n  4. The _Aphis Flea_—Which attacks the _rachis_ and floral envelopes.\r\n\r\n  5. { The _Ear cockle_, } Which destroys the growing grain.\r\n     { The _Corn Moth_,  }\r\n\r\n  6. The _Corn Weevil_—Which eats the flower from the grain.\r\n\r\n  7. The _Little-grain Moth_—Which attacks the grain in store.\r\n\r\n  8. The _Meal-worm Beetle_—Living upon ground corn or flour.\r\n\r\nNow, this list may be said to have reference to eight stages in the\r\ngrowth and preparation of wheat, and they mostly apply to other grains\r\nalso—namely, 1. The germinating plant; 2. The growing plant; 3. The\r\ngrowing flower; 4. The green ear of corn; 5. The young grain; 6. The\r\nperfected grain; 7. The stored grain; and 8. In the state of flour.\r\n\r\n1. The _Slug_ may be described as a houseless snail. There are several\r\nspecies, but the milky slug (_Limax agrestis_) and the black slug (_L.\r\nater_) are those most common to our corn crops, and are more especially\r\nmischievous to wheat; for, as this crop usually succeeds clover or\r\n“seeds,” in which they breed most rapidly, so, the older the clover lea,\r\nthe more eggs will be ready to hatch in the wheat crop, and this all the\r\nmore readily as the wheat is nearly always put in with a single\r\nploughing, and with as little cultivation as possible.\r\n\r\nThe best remedy will be found in encouraging insectivorous birds—the\r\nlark, rook, starling, peewit, and others, eating them either in the egg\r\nor young state with great avidity; a good assistance to whose labours\r\nmay be supplied in a few broods of ducks from the farmyard, which it\r\nwill pay well to have tended by a good boy—where such can be found—as\r\nthese birds are most efficient as destroyers of slugs and caterpillars.\r\n\r\nStore pigs turned into old leas, where they can do no mischief, will get\r\nno bad living where snails and insects abound.\r\n\r\n_Wire-worms._—The several species of beetle which produce the wire-worm\r\nbelong to the genus _Elater_. They are of a long oval shape: about half\r\nthe length belongs to the head and thorax, and the other to the abdomen.\r\nEvery schoolboy knows that when he holds the insect on its back it\r\nelevates the abdominal portion, and again lets it fall so as to make a\r\nbeating sound; and hence its generic name, and also its common name of\r\nclick-and-hammer beetle. If he remove his finger when in this position,\r\nthe creature immediately skips up and turns on its feet, from which\r\naction it has got the name of “skipjack.”\r\n\r\nCurtis has estimated nearly seventy species of click-beetles as\r\nproducing wire-worms in this country; but the three following are those\r\ngenerally met with—_Elater lineatus_, _E. obscurus_, and _E.\r\nruficaudis_. These all attack corn and almost every other kind of\r\nvegetable.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of these are very much alike, being hard, leathery, wiry\r\ncaterpillars, which vary in length to about three-quarters of an inch,\r\naccording to age. These are mostly smooth, and have six feet on their\r\nthoracic segments, and a false foot or _proleg_ in the middle of the\r\nunderpart of the terminal section of the abdomen—characters by which\r\nwire-worms may be distinguished from all others. Their length varies\r\nwith age; as they live for some years in the larva state, so the\r\ndifferent sizes mark so many broods, which in some fields are annually\r\nprovided for. It should here be observed that the wire-worm does not\r\nbreed; these larvæ can only be hatched from the eggs of the female\r\nclick-beetle: hence, then, destroying the worms prevents the development\r\nof their parent.\r\n\r\nNow, as we have seen whole fields of wheat destroyed by wire-worms, it\r\nbecomes important to examine the nature of this attack, with a view to\r\npoint out a remedy. If, then, we go into a corn field in early spring,\r\nand see the young wheat blades looking yellow and sickly, we shall\r\nseldom be long in finding the wire-worm, on carefully taking up some of\r\nthe affected plants. Its position will be at the base of the plant,\r\nsometimes eating its way into its centre, and so eating out its very\r\nheart; or perhaps it may nibble away the outer coat of the young stem,\r\nand so prevent any nutriment passing into the blade. One worm will be\r\nenough to kill a single blade; but, alas! it frequently happens that he\r\neither visits all the blades, or is assisted by many individuals to each\r\nplant. This abundance we have observed more particularly on the breaking\r\nup of old pastures, old seeds, or saintfoin _lea_, in which not only\r\nhave we many broods of wire-worms, but the eggs of a fresh lot, which\r\nhatch in time to eat the spring wheats. Again, this large increase we\r\nhave ever observed in districts where rooks are few or much molested.\r\nThe rook is a constant visitor to the clover field; but when the plant\r\nis young he is driven off, because the farmer “cannot think what else he\r\ncan come for but the clover buds;” and when he sees some of these\r\nstrewing the ground where the birds have been, he is confirmed in his\r\nopinion: but, if he carefully looked at the buds themselves, he would\r\nfind them of a sickly hue, however recent the attack, and, if he looked\r\ndeeper he might find the real enemy.\r\n\r\nFortified, then, with repeated observations of this kind, if asked how\r\nbest to keep under wire-worms, we say most unhesitatingly, encourage the\r\nrook: he is one of the farmer’s best labourers; and though, like John,\r\nand Dick, and Hodge, he will sometimes run into mischief, it is surely\r\nbetter to institute a judicious police than to condemn and execute\r\nwithout very strong evidence.\r\n\r\nYarrell, in his beautiful “British Birds,” has the following remarks\r\nupon this highly-important subject:—\r\n\r\n     The attempts occasionally made by man to interfere with the balance\r\n     of powers as arranged and sustained by Nature, are seldom\r\n     successful. An extensive experiment appears to have been made in\r\n     some of the agricultural districts on the Continent, the result of\r\n     which has been the opinion that farmers do wrong in destroying\r\n     rooks, jays, sparrows, and, indeed, birds in general on their\r\n     farms, particularly where there are orchards. In our own country,\r\n     particularly on some very large farms in Devonshire, the\r\n     proprietors determined, a few summers ago, to try the result of\r\n     offering a great reward for heads of rooks; but the issue proved\r\n     destructive to the farms, for nearly the whole of the crops failed\r\n     for three successive years, and they have since been forced to\r\n     import rooks and other birds to stock their farms with. A similar\r\n     experiment was made a few years ago in a northern county,\r\n     particularly in reference to rooks, but with no better success; the\r\n     farmers were obliged to reinstate the rooks to save their crops.\r\n\r\nBut as, perhaps, the most interesting account of the value of rooks will\r\nbe found in an extract from the _Magazine of Natural History_, vol. vi.\r\np. 142, we cannot do better than transcribe it:—\r\n\r\n     “In the neighbourhood of my native place (in the county of York),”\r\n     says the writer, Mr. T. Clithero, “is a rookery belonging to W.\r\n     Vavasour, Esq., of Weston, in Wharfdale, in which it is estimated\r\n     that there are 10,000 rooks; that 1 lb. of food a week is a very\r\n     moderate allowance for each bird, and that nine-tenths of their\r\n     food consists of worms, insects, and their larvæ; for, although\r\n     they do considerable damage to the fields for a few weeks in\r\n     seed-time, and a few weeks in harvest, particularly in backward\r\n     seasons, yet a very large proportion of their food, even at these\r\n     seasons, consists of insects and worms, which (if we except a few\r\n     acorns and walnuts in autumn) compose at all other times the whole\r\n     of their subsistence. Here, then, if my data be correct, there is\r\n     the enormous quantity of 468,000 lb., or 209 tons, of worms,\r\n     insects, and their larvæ, destroyed by the rooks of a single\r\n     rookery in one year. To everyone who knows how very destructive to\r\n     vegetation are the larvæ of the tribes of insects, as well as\r\n     worms, fed upon by rooks, some slight idea may be formed of the\r\n     devastation which rooks are the means of preventing.”\r\n\r\nLet this, then, suffice for the rooks; but starlings, wagtails, larks,\r\nand other birds, are also helpmates to the farmer; and therefore the\r\nwanton destruction of these will certainly bring, nay, has already\r\nbrought, a great amount of trouble upon the cultivator of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe destruction we speak of has been committed by clubs and societies\r\nestablished for the purpose; but, as their members are mostly filled up\r\nwith all sorts of prejudices—few being naturalists, or even accurate\r\nobservers—it becomes daily a matter of more pressing importance that\r\nmiddle-class education, if not National-school teaching, should\r\nrecognise the value of the natural sciences.\r\n\r\n2. The _Gout-fly_ (_Chlorops glabra_) and the _Saw-fly_ (_Sirex\r\npygmæus_) both lay their eggs below the first node or knot of the young\r\nplant, which, as soon as they hatch, form maggots that eat out the\r\nsubstance of the stems and the nodes, which thus become weakened and\r\nultimately break off, or, if left standing, the ears of corn as they\r\nappear will be dried, whitened, and infertile.\r\n\r\nIn these, as in most cases of insect attacks, we have an occasional\r\nblight of such extent as to destroy whole crops, against which we are\r\nalmost powerless, as we know so little of the economy of the creatures\r\nby whom the mischief is caused; still, there can be little doubt but\r\nthat their periodical appearance, to the extent to cause them to be\r\nrecognised as _blights_, is due to the thinning of their enemies; and we\r\nhave always observed that a paucity of the _Hirundines_—the swallow\r\ntribe of birds, their greatest enemies—is coupled with a great increase\r\nof the smaller insects which it is the vocation of swallows, bats, and\r\nothers of the hawking insectivorous creatures, to take on the wing.\r\n\r\n3. The _Wheat-midge_ (_Cecidomyia tritici_), also called the\r\nHessian-fly, is sometimes very destructive to the wheat crop. In 1860 we\r\nobserved the effects of this creature to a greater extent than we have\r\nbefore known, in not a few instances rendering the crop scarcely worth\r\nreaping. Upon this creature we sent the following notice to the\r\n_Agricultural Gazette_ for August 30, 1862:—\r\n\r\n     The wheat-midge (_Cecidomyia tritici_) has been so destructive for\r\n     the last two or three years, that every fact connected with its\r\n     history ought to be of great interest. Curtis tells us that “in\r\n     Scotland one-third of the crop was lost, and the farmers suffered\r\n     severely in 1828 and the three following years;” whilst “in Suffolk\r\n     the yield[19] of wheat was one-third less in some districts in 1841\r\n     than was expected.”\r\n\r\n     [19] We believe this creature to be one of the most common causes of\r\ndeficient yield, so that a knowledge of its history is all-important in\r\nestimating the value of a crop, which, as a rule, we should always put\r\nlower in the seasons when this blight abounds.\r\n\r\n     The presence or absence of this insect is so important as affecting\r\n     the yield, that we now never fail to look for it in every crop upon\r\n     which we would offer a judgment in this respect.\r\n\r\n     It is easily detected in the larva state on opening some of the\r\n     chaff-scales—pales—of affected crops, as in the interior of these\r\n     will be found some minute larvæ (maggots) of a bright yellow or\r\n     orange colour. In the earlier period of the blossom these larvæ\r\n     will be found about the stamens and pistils; later, upon the\r\n     grain, which is always shrivelled and lost where the attack has\r\n     been made.\r\n\r\n     The colour of the maggots is so much like that of the red-rust as\r\n     often to be mistaken for it; the difference, however, between the\r\n     bunches of minute granular fungi and living worms will be made\r\n     apparent to the most careless observer by the assistance of a\r\n     common pocket lens. We find two terms in use for these yellow\r\n     appearances—namely, red-rust and red-gum; and as we have so often\r\n     found them employed indiscriminately, we would restrict the former\r\n     to the fungus,[20] thus—_Uredo rubigo_, red-rust; and _Cecidomyia\r\n     tritici_, red-gum. Our observations on the latter this year have\r\n     chiefly been made in the counties of Sussex and Gloucester, in both\r\n     of which we have seen this insidious enemy at work to an alarming\r\n     extent. In the former county, with a very limited extent of\r\n     red-rust; in the latter, the later and more delicate wheats have\r\n     both red-rust and red-gum in the same crop: and the interest of the\r\n     subject will be the more forcibly apprehended when we say that in\r\n     some crops, which, from a first glance at the straw and ears, we\r\n     should have put down as somewhere about thirty bushels per acre, we\r\n     have, after a more minute inspection of the ears, estimated at less\r\n     than twenty bushels; and, indeed, in one field which we have\r\n     examined during the last week (August, 1862), affected by the\r\n     _Cladosporium_, _Uredo_, and _Cecidomyia_, there will scarcely be a\r\n     yield in good grains of the amount of the seed sown.\r\n\r\n[20] See _ante_, p. 185.\r\n\r\nThe fly which lays the eggs from which these yellow larvæ are derived is\r\nof about the size of a gnat, and usually takes the wing in the evening,\r\nin which case, if its enemies the bats are not numerous, smother fires\r\nlighted towards sundown on the wind side of the fields are not only\r\ndestructive to large numbers, but act as an offensive notice to quit to\r\nothers. Curtis says:—\r\n\r\n     With regard to the Hessian-fly, even if its presence could be\r\n     ascertained in the early stages, it does not seem possible to\r\n     devise any means of destroying the eggs or young larvæ, unless\r\n     feeding off the blade with sheep would effect the object; and when\r\n     their progress is detected by their mischievous works, at a more\r\n     advanced period, nothing, I apprehend, but sacrificing the crop\r\n     would arrest them. It appears, therefore, to be an evil to which we\r\n     must occasionally submit; but, to guard against its immediate\r\n     recurrence, it will only be necessary to collect and burn the\r\n     stubble after the corn is reaped, by which means the larvæ and pupæ\r\n     which are concealed at the base of the stalk will, of course, be\r\n     destroyed.\r\n\r\nNow, in reference to wheat stubbles, we would remark that the\r\nold-fashioned plan of leaving them long as a protection, and, we may\r\nadd, a preserve of food for partridges, had its good effects in an\r\nagricultural point of view; but if this be done, we advocate the burning\r\nof the stubs on the soil, as they will thus act better as a manure,\r\nwhile the destruction of insects by the process must be enormous. All\r\nconcur that modern agriculture suffers increasingly from insects; hence,\r\nthen, an extended study of their habits seems daily more desirable: and\r\nwe boldly assert that if our country schoolmasters would teach their\r\npupils to observe insect life, they may be doing more good to\r\nagriculture than all our present so-called agricultural colleges and\r\nschools put together.\r\n\r\n4. The _Aphis flea_ (_Aphis granaria_) is a creature destructive to the\r\ngrain by “sucking the verdure out on’t.” We have this year (1864) seen\r\nthis insect, more especially the _apterous_—wingless—females, sticking\r\non to the green wheat ears to such an extent as to render a walk into\r\nthe crop a disgustingly dirty process. It would seem that a continuous\r\ndry and warm season favours the increase of these creatures; but, as we\r\nhave always observed that the earlier sown wheats nearly always escape,\r\nfrom their coming into ear and advancing to ripeness before the aphis\r\nhas increased its countless broods; so then we should recommend early\r\nwheat sowing, wherever and whenever practicable, as a preventive of the\r\npest; in fact, the being in good time with all farm work has every\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n5. The two affections of the grain in our table are widely different in\r\ntheir modes of attack, but both tend to lessen the quantity of produce.\r\nThe first, the Ear-Cockle (_Vitrio tritici_) is an affection of the\r\ngrain, which at starting it will be well to distinguish from smut or\r\nbunt. In the latter, the grain is filled with what appears a black\r\npowder, the grains of which the microscope shows to be a fungus;[21]\r\nwhilst in the cockle the seed, which is purple externally—hence called\r\n“purples”—is filled with what appears to be white cotton wool. This,\r\nunder the microscope, has the appearance of a multitude of eels. These\r\nare, indeed, minute infusorial worms, and are exceedingly curious; the\r\nsmallest portion of the cottony substance taken on a pin’s point and\r\njust moistened with water, often showing thousands of the eels under a\r\ngood instrument; for drawings and descriptions of which and good\r\ndrawings (after Bauer), we should recommend the reader to consult\r\n“Curtis’s Farm Insects.” A damp season favours the production of these;\r\nhence drainage and such conditions as increase the effects of damp and\r\ncold are to be guarded against.\r\n\r\n[21] See _ante_, p. 183.\r\n\r\nThe _Corn Moth_ is best known by the presence of a small, slightly hairy\r\nmaggot, which is found to eat the flour from the grain; this is the\r\nlarva of a small moth, probably the _Butalis cerealella_. It is easily\r\nfound in the chaff scales; and during the summer of 1861 we saw as many\r\nas six in a single ear, and it was, indeed, one of the causes of the bad\r\nyield of that year. We know of no remedy for this evil; but, perhaps, if\r\nwe were better acquainted with the habits of the moth itself, means\r\nmight be devised for taking it before the eggs are laid in the young ear\r\nof corn.\r\n\r\n6. The _Corn or Granary Weevil_ (_Calandra granaria_) and others.—These\r\nattack corn in store, and probably differ in species according to the\r\nkind of corn. This is a small beetle, the female of which makes a hole\r\nin the grain and deposits an egg, which soon hatches into the maggot;\r\nthis eats out the grain with great assiduity until its partial period of\r\nrest in the pupa state; which passed, the beetle finishes the work, and\r\nmay frequently be found in the interior of wheat.\r\n\r\nThe usual structures of granaries and corn-stores contribute to the\r\nincrease of this pest, as they are mostly dark and ill-ventilated\r\nchambers. The best remedy is to expose the grain to the greatest\r\npossible amount of cold, by spreading it on the floors in hard frosts,\r\nand letting in light and air. Curtis quotes the “Bulletin des Sciences\r\nAgriculture” for July, 1826, for the following plan:—“Lay fleeces of\r\nwool, which have not been scoured, on the grain; the oily matter\r\nattracts the insects amongst the wool, where they soon die, from what\r\ncause is not exactly known. M. B. C. Payrandeau related to the\r\nPhilomatic Society of Paris that his father had made the discovery in\r\n1811, and had since practised it on a large scale.”\r\n\r\n7. The moth that visits granaries (_Tinia granella_) may here be\r\nadverted to. The presence of the larvæ of the little grain moth may soon\r\nbe ascertained in the granary, when one finds several grains of corn\r\nunited by a web, to which will be attached bunches of small granules,\r\nwhich are the exuviæ of the one or two caterpillars belonging to each\r\ngroup of corns.\r\n\r\nThe best method of preventing this is thorough cleanliness, light, and\r\nventilation in the granary. If, however, the moth has got possession,\r\nthen we recommend sulphur to be burnt in iron pans—old saucepan lids are\r\nas good as anything—stopping up all the crevices. This will be an\r\neffectual remedy, not only for the moth, but for the weevils and other\r\ninsect pests; and if a pound of sulphur be occasionally burnt in the\r\nbarn, even rats must succumb to the gas which is generated.\r\n\r\n8. The _Meal-worm Beetle_ (_Tenebrio molitor_), which generates commonly\r\nin the meal-bins of this country, and the _T. obscurus_, which has been\r\nintroduced in American flour, are two forms of beetle, the larvæ of\r\nwhich are “meal-worms.” These are best prevented by not keeping too\r\nlarge a store of flour, always having this dry and in the best\r\ncondition, and storing, as far as possible, in a clean, light, and airy\r\nposition. Indeed, as Curtis remarks, “Cleanliness is the best guard\r\nagainst these insects;” and we cannot better conclude this chapter than\r\nby further quoting the following from this excellent author:—\r\n\r\n     In looking back to the variety of insects that feed upon corn, and\r\n     the multitudes that are often congregated in one heap, there can be\r\n     no doubt that a very large portion must be occasionally ground up\r\n     with the corn and consumed by the public. This is not only a\r\n     disagreeable fact, but it may be the source of very serious\r\n     consequences, for I think it not improbable that many diseases\r\n     might be traced to the insects which are converted with the\r\n     infested flour into bread, amounting to such a large percentage,\r\n     that if they have the slightest medicinal or deleterious qualities,\r\n     it is impossible to deny the influence they must exercise upon the\r\n     human system. I have known bushels of cocoa-nuts, which were every\r\n     one worm-eaten and full of maggots, with their webs, excrement,\r\n     cast-off skins, pupæ, and cocoons, all ground down to make\r\n     chocolate, flavoured, I suppose, with vanilla!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nSCIENCE IN THE CULTIVATION OF CORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of the present chapter will be to point out the principles\r\nconcerned in the more immediate acts connected with the cultivation of\r\ncorn. In so doing in the present case, as in the discussion of the\r\npreceding subjects, it may not be out of place here to state that it has\r\nnot, nor will it be, our object to enter into the every-day practical\r\ndetails of crop-management, but to dwell more particularly upon those\r\npoints in cultivation which may be said to belong more especially to the\r\nscience of the subject.\r\n\r\nThis chapter, then, will be more especially devoted to the consideration\r\nof the three following subjects:—\r\n\r\n1st. On the uses of special manures for corn crops.\r\n\r\n2nd. On the quality and quantity of corn to be used for seed.\r\n\r\n3rd. On the period for harvesting corn.\r\n\r\n1st. _On the Uses of Manures._—It is pretty generally agreed that\r\nspecial manuring for corn, when grown in the ordinary shifting crop\r\nsystem, is positively injurious, and more truly so, if farmyard dung be\r\nemployed. Still, on our own farm we were over-persuaded to give a\r\ndressing of rotted dung to some wheat. As the previous crop, turnips,\r\nhad all but failed, we yielded on being told that it was a common Dorset\r\ncustom, but, fortunately, only to the extent of a few acres down the\r\nmiddle of the field, on which part, at harvest, the main of the crop had\r\nfallen to the ground, with the affection known as knee-bent. There was\r\nplenty of straw, not at all good; but the yield of plump grains can\r\nhardly be half of those of the other parts of the field.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, we have never observed special manuring to be useful\r\nexcept as top-dressings in early spring, at which time soot, or, better\r\nstill, a mixture of soot and guano, may be sown on most wheat crops to\r\nadvantage, and more especially where the young plant has been injured by\r\nthe slug or the wire-worm, as in these cases the lower joint and the\r\nwinter root are destroyed. If, then, the young plant be at this time\r\nstimulated with the mixture as advised, and the crop be afterwards\r\nrolled, we supply nutriment just in the form that it can be readily\r\nassimilated, the injured plants send out new roots from the second\r\njoint, and begin a fresh life, whilst the uninjured ones push out new\r\nbuds—_stolons_—and all grow the better, because the roller has aided in\r\nfirmly fixing the plants in the ground.\r\n\r\nThere have been those who would tell us that manure can be best used to\r\nwheat by subjecting the seed to various steeps; but we need hardly stop\r\nto question the folly of the assertions which from time to time\r\nre-appear, both at home and abroad, upon this point.\r\n\r\nThus far the subject of manures has been treated as for wheat as a\r\nshifting crop; but this crop has been grown year after year on the same\r\nsoil, and, in some cases, without an apparent diminution in quantity or\r\nquality. One instance that came under our own observation was in\r\nGloucestershire, where a cottager had grown wheat on the same plot of\r\nground for thirteen years, and, for aught I know, it may still be\r\ncontinued. Hence the subsoil was _Lias shale_; but it was well drained\r\nand cultivated as a garden, the manure employed being the contents of\r\nthe garden-house.\r\n\r\nIn cases of this kind, an annual application of manure is absolutely\r\nnecessary; and we are happy to find that different manures and their\r\neffects have been experimented upon and duly noted, _for the same\r\nplots_, during a period of no less than twenty years, and that by such\r\ncareful and reliable inquirers as J. B. Lawes, Esq., F.R.S., and Dr.\r\nGilbert, F.R.S.; full details of the results of whose labours upon this\r\nsubject will be found in Vol. XXV. of the _Journal of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society of England_, from which we have extracted some of\r\nthe following general conclusions as to average yield and weight of corn\r\nfor the lengthened periods quoted:—\r\n\r\n1.

We should,\r\nhowever, look for our seed, not from a richer soil or a warmer climate,\r\nbut the reverse. Oats, for example, as previously shown, degenerate,\r\neven to wild ones, if the poor seed be brought from a poor, cold soil,\r\nto be cultivated in land still poorer. We, however, on our farm, sowed\r\noats during the past season weighing 48 lb. per bushel on a sandy soil;\r\nand, although our return was not so large in bushels as though we had\r\nsown black oats, yet their weight was but just under that of the seed.\r\nNow, these oats were from Canada, and, no doubt, the warm climate of the\r\nwest of England suited them as to change.\r\n\r\nAs regards barley, we prefer a good sample for seed, if it be of\r\nhome-growth; at the same time, very thin samples from Russia, or the\r\nStates, often do well. Last season, we sowed some American barley of so\r\npoor a quality, that it was impossible to tell its name, but which gave\r\nfor 50 acres an average yield of 40 bushels per acre, so even and plump,\r\nthat only 28 sacks of “tailing” were separated, and the bulk—good\r\nChevallier barley—was equal to any in the market.\r\n\r\nIn cultivating wheat, climate must ever be considered, as only in warm\r\nsituations can the finest samples of white wheats be grown. Upland cold\r\npositions are suitable for red wheats, and so are undrained lowlands;\r\nstill, good farming will render it possible to grow white wheats where,\r\nbefore drainage and other ameliorating processes, such was impossible.\r\n\r\nAs regards the quantity to be sown per acre, it will be seen that the\r\nmargin is sufficiently wide, if we say that it lies between half a peck\r\nand half a quarter. In garden cultivation, with deep digging, and in the\r\nabsence of weeds, birds, or insects, where you can choose your time for\r\nevery operation, dibble in a seed in a place, the minimum quantity may\r\nsuffice, as good crops have been got from a very small quantity of seed;\r\nbut garden experimenters rather too positively lay down the law, when\r\nthey tell the farmer that this thin seeding will do equally well on\r\nbroad acres, where every operation is circumscribed by circumstances.\r\nWhere there is so much to do, you cannot always get everything done at\r\nthe right season, even if the soil were favourable for so doing; and the\r\nperiod at which you get your land ready for the seed, and the time of\r\nsowing it, makes a wide difference. But there is another point of\r\neven—if possible—greater importance; namely, the _quality_ of the seed.\r\nNow, on our farm we always ascertain the germinating power of every\r\nsample of seed before sowing; and from this, as well as from the results\r\nof numerous experiments on this subject, we have arrived at the\r\nconclusion, that there are immense differences in this respect, which\r\ncannot possibly be made out at sight, but can only be ascertained\r\nexperimentally. To make this matter clear, we append a table (2) of the\r\nresults of experiments on this point upon no less than forty-two\r\nsamples, which were tried in 1863.\r\n\r\nNow, these experiments showed a want of germinating power, in some of\r\nthe samples, of more than 50 per cent., and in the 42 samples an average\r\nof 24·5 per cent.; from which it will be seen that sometimes the thick\r\nsower is not the thick seeder, and his failure of a crop is not always\r\ndue to slugs and wireworms.\r\n\r\nThese experiments were published in the _Agricultural Gazette_, and they\r\nevoked some remarks from a learned divine, so unfair and uncandid, as\r\nonly to be excused by the nature of his professional education and modes\r\nof thought. Now, when this gentleman affected to believe that these\r\nthings could not be so, and that with him every seed germinated, we\r\ncould only conclude that the days of miracles had not quite ceased; but\r\nas, in later numbers of the _Gazette_, his opinions have been somewhat\r\nmodified in this respect, we yet think him capable of riding a hobby too\r\nhard, though not until the pace has thrown him down and broken his knees\r\nwill he own it.\r\n\r\n2.

On our own farm we\r\nsowed four and six pecks of wheat where double the quantity had been the\r\nrule before Christmas, and from six to eight pecks afterwards; six pecks\r\nof barley and oats, where a sack had previously been the rule. With the\r\nwheat and barley we were right, except in the very late-sown of the\r\nlatter, when time was only sufficient to grow a single head, and not to\r\nallow of stooling. Here a sack would have given a better result. The\r\nsame with our oats: thin seeding caused them to run to straw; they were\r\non a poor sand, taller than the men who cut them; but had we doubled our\r\nseed, we conclude we should have had shorter straw and more corn.\r\n\r\nIf, then, these things be so, the judgment of the farmer will be best\r\nshown in rightly weighing _all_ the circumstances of his case; and in\r\nthe matter of seeding, as with physic, he will find that homœopathy\r\n_alone_ is only quackery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nON HARVESTING CORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA knowledge of when corn is in the best condition to be harvested is a\r\nmatter of great importance; and hence some observations upon this\r\nsubject may fitly conclude this part of our work.\r\n\r\nNot to enter too deeply into chemical matters, we may state, at least as\r\na probable general conclusion, that there is a period in the growth of\r\ngrain and pulse crops before they are ripe, in which all the feeding\r\nqualities will be found diffused in the several plants; a little later,\r\nand the feeding matters will be found more particularly concentrated in\r\nthe seed. Now, if oats, peas, and beans, be cut in this “green” state,\r\nthey make either a fresh food, or can be dried into hay, which, when cut\r\ninto chaff, is found to be an excellent feeding material; and as such\r\ncrops can be quickly cleared and cheaply employed, there is no doubt but\r\nthat they will henceforward be more generally used in this way than\r\nformerly.\r\n\r\nBut, again, in ripening of wheat there would appear to be a point in its\r\nprogress short of “dead ripe,” in which every quality is fully stored in\r\nthe seed; and, after this period, the seed-covering becomes thicker, and\r\nmakes more bran in proportion to flour: facts made out from the\r\nfollowing results of experiments of samples in three different states:—\r\n\r\nTABLE OF THE RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS WITH WHEAT.\r\n\r\n     _Sample 1._—Wheat gathered when the grain was sweet, and almost\r\n     milky. The stalks green. Date, July 25th, 1856.\r\n\r\n     _Sample 2._—Wheat from the same field, gathered when in the state\r\n     of hardening grain. The stalk just yellowed all the way down.\r\n     August 2nd.\r\n\r\n     _Sample 3._—Wheat from the same field, gathered when what is termed\r\n     “dead ripe,” having been, in fact, left longer than it otherwise\r\n     would, for want of hands.

Still, it will be seen that sample 3\r\nhas the advantage in measure: hence, then, unless the miller will agree\r\nto give a better price for a “gay”[22] sample, it will be to the\r\nfarmer’s advantage to leave it to fully ripen, if he can make sure that\r\nit can be kept from shedding in harvesting, and the attacks of birds.\r\n\r\n[22] The farmer’s term for early-cut corn, in both the middle and West\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nAs regards barley, if our crop is required for home use for feeding\r\npurposes, we should cut at least a week earlier than most people, and we\r\nshould have as good feeding quality, without loss from winds, loss in\r\nharvesting, and from birds; but, if our land grows malting barley, the\r\nsample will be a better, and more uniform in germinating, when “dead\r\nripe.”\r\n\r\nDuring the last season (1864), our pupil, F. Witts, Esq., collected\r\nbunches of corn from a crop of fine white oats at the under-mentioned\r\ndates. From these we counted 500 seeds, and took their weights; and,\r\nthough we confess that many such experiments will be required to settle\r\nthe whole facts of the case, yet the results given in table 6 are so\r\ncurious, that we hope in future to direct our pupils in carrying out\r\nmany similar experiments.\r\n\r\nThe two samples, each of the 20th and 21st, were probably obtained from\r\ndifferent parts of the same field, yet they lead us to conclude, as do\r\nthose of the other dates, that a single day, if a hot summer, makes a\r\ngreat deal of difference. Now, the crop was not cut until a week after\r\nthe 21st, and yet we are persuaded that we should have gained by cutting\r\non the 20th rather than later, and, at least, we should have prevented\r\nmuch loss from “shed” seeds.\r\n\r\n6.

In treating this subject,\r\nthen, we shall endeavour to show that the study of how to grow good\r\nfences, by putting the matter upon correct principles, will tend to the\r\ngood of all parties concerned.\r\n\r\nFences are of two well-known types: _Dead fences_, such as the natural\r\nboundaries of streams, artificial ditches, raised mounds, walls,\r\nrailings, &c.; _Live fences_, grown from living trees or shrubs. These\r\nlatter, then, as forming no unimportant part of farm cultivation, will\r\noccupy our attention in the next few chapters.\r\n\r\nWith regard to dead fences, those in more general farm use may be\r\nbriefly described under the heads of railings, mounds, and stone walls.\r\n\r\nRailings are of various kinds, according to circumstances; the simplest\r\nform of these consist of piles driven into the ground at about five feet\r\napart and secured by split larch on the top, and either larch cross\r\npieces below or iron hoops. In making these the landlord usually finds\r\nthe rough material, the tenant paying for the work, the usual cost for\r\ncutting-out being a penny for each pile. This kind of fencing is mostly\r\nemployed as a protection to young live fences, or to fill up gaps in\r\nolder ones.\r\n\r\nMounds are simply lines of raised earthworks, and are used where stone\r\nor fencing materials are expensive, or where live fences can only be\r\ngrown with difficulty. Sometimes these elevations are crowned with\r\nprivet or some light hedge-plant. They are occasionally employed as\r\nfield boundaries by river sides, where they subserve the purpose of\r\nkeeping out floods, but usually the mound is more used as a division of\r\nproperty than as a fence.\r\n\r\nStone walls are the commonest fences over miles of country in the middle\r\nof England, the Cotteswold hills being remarkable for dry stone\r\nwalls—the stone for these “Oolite freestones” being well adapted for the\r\npurpose—of course they are dry, that is, built without mortar, as this\r\nwould render the work too costly for field boundaries. These walls have\r\na wild and desolate appearance, but they are commended by some as not\r\nharbouring birds or vermin; but this is a questionable good, for as\r\nregards birds, we contend that the stone wall districts would be better\r\noff if they afforded shelter for a few more; but stoats, mice, snails,\r\nbeetles, and small fry of the kind of no use whatever, are absolutely\r\nprotected by the stone wall.\r\n\r\nIt is said again, that the stone wall offers little chance for weeds,\r\nbut to those who have been accustomed to observe about a yard on either\r\nside of a wall constantly left unploughed and uncleaned, stone walls\r\nwill be considered as nurseries and protectors of weeds, and those, too,\r\nof a highly mischievous character, as couch thistles, docks, &c.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the couch grass (_Triticum repens_), we have traced it\r\nrunning from this source for a couple of yards into the ploughed field,\r\nwith the inevitable consequence that in the furrows it is cut into\r\nconvenient lengths to multiply the pest; and it has been on this account\r\nthat we have ever been careful to direct dragging and harrowing to be\r\ndone in the direction of the walls, before proceeding with these\r\noperations over the rest of the field, and we recommend the cutting down\r\nof weeds under these walls before a crop of corn be carried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nON THE PLANTS FOR “LIVE” FENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe native plants which have been employed for living fences include\r\nmost of our indigenous trees and shrubs, with some few which, if not\r\nnative, have yet been for a long time naturalised throughout Great\r\nBritain. The most important of these will be found in the following\r\nlist:—\r\n\r\n           { Oak          }\r\n           { Beech        } Forest trees usually forming\r\n  Group 1. { Hornbeam     } fences by means of undergrowth\r\n           { Ash          } from lopping and\r\n           { Elm          } cutting.\r\n           { Maple        }\r\n\r\n           { Whitethorn   }\r\n           { Blackthorn   } Trees and shrubs forming fences\r\n  Group 2. { Crab         } by reason of a thick-growth\r\n           { Buckthorn    } and repellant thorns and spines.\r\n           { Holly        }\r\n\r\n           { Nut          }\r\n           { Privet       } Shrubs which for the most part\r\n  Group 3. { Dogwood      } fill up badly-grown fences.\r\n           { Spearwood    } These are really weeds in\r\n           { Guelder Rose } good hedges.\r\n           { Elder        }\r\n\r\nIn the first group, it may be remarked, that oak, ash, and elm are\r\nseldom, if ever, planted for hedges; for in the first place these plants\r\nare usually too expensive, and in the next they are not esteemed as\r\nhedge plants. They mostly find their way in the fence by seeds being\r\nsown by the wind, as is often the case with ash-keys, or they may start\r\nup a bush of underwood after being cut down as hedge-row timber; in\r\neither case they are very unsightly in appearance, and far from good in\r\nhedges. Trees should not be grown in hedge-rows where the fence is to be\r\nperfect, as these overshadow the best hedge-plants, and the sides of the\r\nboles always offer weak places.\r\n\r\nBeech and hornbeam are frequently used for garden and smaller fences,\r\nand, when well grown, are really useful as a protection, as their\r\nwithered leaves are persistent, that is, they do not fall off until new\r\nones are formed. They are grown comparatively quickly, and will flourish\r\nin poor light soils, and if strong plants be made to cross each other in\r\nplanting, they may be trained to form a strong fence.\r\n\r\nIn the second group, the whitethorn (_Cratægus oxyacantha_) stands\r\ndeservedly at the top of the list; in fact, it is the very best\r\nhedge-row plant we possess. It is not slow of growth in congenial soil,\r\nespecially if well attended to. Its thorns render it thoroughly\r\nrepellant to cattle. It bears cutting, clipping, and trimming better\r\nthan any other; and though variable in its behaviour in different soils,\r\nit is, after all, capable of bearing a greater diversity in this respect\r\nthan any other of our list. The whitethorn, then, is deservedly held in\r\nthe highest repute for the growth of the most perfect live fence for all\r\nordinary farm purposes; the blackthorn, crab, and buckthorn being\r\ntolerated only because they possess some of the same characteristics as\r\nthe whitethorn. As regards the latter, it is exceedingly long-lived,\r\nand, if left to itself, forms trees of considerable size, which are\r\noccasionally very beautiful as forming part of park scenery; still in\r\nhedges it can be kept to any size, and cutting it in causes a new wood\r\nto spring up, which has all the characteristics of a young, quick plant.\r\n\r\nThese are merits of the greatest importance in favour of the whitethorn,\r\nwhich will ever make this the best hedge-row plant, as if we succeed to\r\na whitethorn fence, which has been trimmed and kept within due bounds,\r\nthere is no difficulty in continuing the process; and so if the hedge be\r\nleft to grow tall and wild it may be cut out either wholly or partially,\r\nsome stems cut half through—as in the process of _plashing_—laid down,\r\nand so a secure though not so tall a fence be formed, that will only\r\ngrow thicker year by year.\r\n\r\nBlackthorn—sloe (_Prunus spinosa_) is formidable enough as regards\r\nthorns, but it cannot stand the same amount of cutting as the\r\nwhitethorn, and, when cut, its young shoots being almost thornless,\r\nmakes a hedge of the sloe the less repellant the more vigorous are its\r\nshoots.\r\n\r\nThe crab-apple (_Pyrus malus_) and the buckthorn (_Rhamnus catharticus_)\r\nmay be considered as accidental in fences; and as, to a great extent,\r\nthey will grow with the quicks and suffer the same treatment without\r\ngrowing as upstarts on the one hand, or refusing to start again after\r\ncrippling on the other, they are both tolerated in fences without quite\r\ngetting a character for being hedgerow weeds.\r\n\r\nThe holly (_Ilex aquifolium_) possesses a wonderful repellant armour in\r\nits spinous, evergreen leaves, on which, account it is esteemed as a\r\nplant for fences:—\r\n\r\n    A hedge of holly, thieves that would invade,\r\n    Repulses like a growing palisade;\r\n    Whose numerous leaves such orient greens invest,\r\n    As in deep winter do the spring arrest.\r\n\r\nThis is one of our native trees, frequently attaining to a great size on\r\neven wild, stony places, with only a thin layer of soil. We have seen\r\nsome fine examples, large enough to secure the holly a place among our\r\nnative forest trees on the “stony Cotteswolds,” as Shakespeare calls the\r\nhigh Gloucestershire range; it is, however, of slow growth, or it would,\r\ndoubtless, be more used for fences: still in poor soils it will, after\r\nall, grow as fast as the whitethorn, Evelyn is eloquent in praise of\r\nholly. He says:—\r\n\r\n     Is there under heaven a more glorious and refreshing object of the\r\n     kind than an impregnable hedge of about four hundred feet in\r\n     length, nine feet high, and five in diameter, which I can show in\r\n     my now ruined gardens at Saye Court (thanks to the Czar of\r\n     Muscovy[23]), at any time of the year, glittering with its armed\r\n     and varnished leaves? The taller standards, at orderly distances,\r\n     blushing with their natural coral; it mocks the rudest assaults of\r\n     the weather, beasts, or hedge-breakers,—\r\n\r\n    Et illum nemo impunè lacessit.\r\n\r\n[23] The Czar Peter the Great resided at Mr. Evelyn’s house, in order\r\nthat he might be near the yard at Deptford, during his stay in England;\r\nbut we do not see why he should be thanked for the holly hedge.\r\n\r\n     It is with us of two eminent kinds, the prickly and smoother\r\n     leaved; or, as some term it, the free holly, not unwelcome, when\r\n     tender, to sheep and other cattle. There is also of the white\r\n     berried, and a golden and silver, variegated in six or seven\r\n     differences, which proceeds from no difference in the species, but\r\n     accidentally, and _naturæ lusu_, as most such variegations do,\r\n     since we are taught how to effect it artificially, namely by sowing\r\n     the seeds, and planting in gravelly soil mixed with store of chalk,\r\n     pressing it hard down: it being certain that they return to their\r\n     native colour when sown in richer mould, and that all the fibres of\r\n     the roots recover their natural food.\r\n\r\nThe differences in the colour of the fruit, as of the colour and shape\r\nof the leaves, is truly a matter of variety. The red-berried holly,\r\nunder the name of “Christmas,” is quite an article of commerce at the\r\nfestive season—so much so that a friend of ours in the neighbourhood of\r\nStroud, who this year (1864-5) had a large tree well covered with\r\nberries, assured us that he had great difficulty in preventing it going\r\nto market with some of the marauders, who scour the country in search of\r\nanything they can sell.\r\n\r\nIn the Worcester market we for many years noticed a sprinkling of white,\r\nor, rather, yellowish-berried holly, a spray or two of which was always\r\nput with the bundle of the red-berried in effecting the many Christmas\r\nsales.\r\n\r\nAs regards the difference in the leaves, although it is true that in the\r\ngardens we have a smooth and unarmed variety, however dwarf the specimen\r\nmay be, yet in wild examples the smooth leaves will, for the most part,\r\nonly be found on the upper parts of tall trees; the poet, then, has been\r\nas true to Nature as graceful in art in the poem of which the following\r\nlines form a part:—\r\n\r\n    Below, a circling fence, its leaves are seen\r\n      Wrinkled and keen.\r\n\r\n    No grazing cattle through their prickly round\r\n      Can reach to wound;\r\n    But as they grow where nothing is to fear,\r\n    Smooth and unarmed, the pointless leaves appear.\r\n\r\n_Southey._\r\n\r\nIn growing hedges, the clipping to keep them within bounds helps to keep\r\nthe holly spinous at any age.\r\n\r\nEvelyn further descants upon the excellency of holly for hedges; and as\r\nthe following remarks are so truly practical, we quote them in this\r\nplace:—\r\n\r\n     The holly is an excellent plant for hedges, and would claim the\r\n     preference to the hawthorn, were it not for the slowness of its\r\n     growth while young, and the difficulty of transplanting it when\r\n     grown to a moderate size. It will grow best in cold, stony land,\r\n     where, if once it takes well, the hedges may be rendered so close\r\n     and thick as to keep out all sorts of animals. These hedges may be\r\n     raised by sowing the berries in the place where they are designed\r\n     to remain, or by plants of three or four years’ growth; but as the\r\n     berries continue in the ground near eighteen months before the\r\n     plants appear, few persons care to wait so long; therefore, the\r\n     usual and best method is to plant the hedges with plants of the\r\n     before-mentioned age. But where this is practised, they should be\r\n     transplanted either early in autumn, or deferred till toward the\r\n     end of March; then the surface of the ground should be covered with\r\n     mulch near their roots, after they are planted, to keep the earth\r\n     moist; and if the season should prove dry, the plants should be\r\n     watered, at least once a-week, until they have taken root,\r\n     otherwise they will be in danger of miscarrying, for which reason\r\n     the autumnal planting is generally preferred to the spring,\r\n     especially in dry grounds. Columella’s description of a good hedge\r\n     is highly applicable to one made of holly, “Neu sit pecori, neu\r\n     pervia furi.” Of the rind of this tree birdlime is made.\r\n\r\n    Alas! in vain with warmth and food\r\n    You cheer the songsters of the wood;\r\n    The barbarous boy from you prepares,\r\n    On treacherous twigs, his viscous snares;\r\n    Yes, the poor bird you nursed shall find\r\n    Destruction in your rifled rind.\r\n\r\nIf we except the Privet, the examples of plants in our third group are\r\nquite unfit for hedge purposes, as they are entirely without offensive\r\narmature. Privet hedges are not unfrequent in gardens, where they are\r\nuseful for boundaries, blinds, and to act as shelter, but as a farm\r\nhedge-plant it is quite useless.\r\n\r\nThe nut, guelder rose, and elder have none of the qualities for hedge\r\ngrowth that are required by the former; on the contrary, they have large\r\nleaves, and so smother the quicks if they grow with them, and when cut\r\nthey shoot rapidly, especially in the case of the elder (_Sambucus\r\nniger_), and so make a hedgerow look ragged by here and there growing a\r\nyard or so above the ordinary hedge-plants; but, besides this, the lower\r\nstems get free from leaves, and hence gaps are easily made in bushes of\r\nnut, dogwood, elder, &c.\r\n\r\nIn the above description of hedgerow plants we have omitted all mention\r\nof yew, holly, laurustinas, furze, and the like, as being more properly\r\nmaterials for ornamental or garden hedges. The furze, however, is\r\nsometimes used on the tops of mounds, in some sandy districts, as a\r\nfence plant, but the constant dying of the old wood and the consequent\r\nexercise by the cottager of a fancied right to pull the hedge to pieces\r\nfor firing render it almost impossible to employ it to any advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nON THE REARING AND PLANTING OF HEDGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rearing of plants for hedges is a matter of so much importance that\r\none can well understand how it has come to be a business of itself; and\r\nas it is better that it should be so, both landlords and tenants will do\r\nrightly to encourage its being done well. If, then, we take it for\r\ngranted that the whitethorn is the best hedge-plant, it will be best to\r\ninquire—as a contribution to the science of the subject—whether there\r\nare not some important varieties of this plant; if so, we should\r\ndetermine which is the best, and encourage its cultivation. As the case\r\nat present stands, nurserymen take no pains in the matter; they usually\r\nemploy children to collect the “haws”—the name by which the fruits are\r\nknown—and it is a matter of perfect indifference where or how they\r\nobtain them.\r\n\r\nNow, as regards the common hawthorn, experience has taught us that seeds\r\nobtained from trees in cold, wild, stony places, such as have\r\nestablished themselves about old quarries on the Cotteswold-hills, more\r\nquickly make good plants than those from the pampered hedge-row in the\r\ndeep vale-lands.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to this, having some years ago observed that certain\r\nwhitethorn-trees came into flower a full fortnight before others, and\r\nthis on the cold forest-marble clays in the exposed country of North\r\nWilts and south of Cirencester, we were induced to examine this tree\r\nmore closely; and the result of the inquiry was to induce a belief that\r\nthis is a much hardier, quicker, and more certain growing plant for\r\nhedge-rows than the commoner form.\r\n\r\nWith these views established in our mind, we were not a little pleased\r\nto find that in the beautiful new edition of “English Botany,” by the\r\naccomplished editor, J. T. Syme, Esq., F.L.S., &c., figures and\r\ndescriptions are given of the two forms; and we here reproduce in\r\nopposite columns the descriptions referred to with a figure of the early\r\nform we have mentioned, that our readers may compare it with the common\r\nwhitethorn:—\r\n\r\n                          _Cratægus oxyacantha._\r\n                 /—————————————————^——————————————————\\\r\n    _Cratægus oxyacanthoides_               _Cratægus monogyna_\r\n    (_Glabrous Whitethorn_).

(See plate.)\r\n\r\nThat the glabrous whitethorn would make the best hedge-row form we have\r\nno doubt, as its free growth and early leafing particularly recommend\r\nit; and besides, though not the commonest, we cannot help thinking it to\r\nbe the hardiest variety, and one that would be likely to succeed in\r\nsoils where the ordinary one would be very slow in growth.\r\n\r\nWe have occasionally met with it in nursery-plantations, as well as in\r\nhedge-rows, where it is distinguished at a glance by its more freely\r\ngrowing twigs and brighter coloured, quite smooth leaves; so also, but\r\nmore rarely, we have met with the Glastonbury thorn in the hedge-row,\r\nwhich we look upon as a variety of the glabrous thorn, a specimen of\r\nwhich is now before us (January, 1865), with both leaves and flowers\r\nwell in bud, in the midst of a deep snow and a severe frost.\r\n\r\nThis variety is fabled to have sprung from Joseph of Arimathæa’s\r\nstaff, which he is supposed to have planted in the soil at Glastonbury,\r\non Christmas-day, prior to the foundation of the abbey at that\r\ninteresting place; and we have found some natives, both here and in\r\nHerefordshire—whither perhaps the thorn had spread with sorts of\r\napples,—who adduce the budding of this thorn, which is usually after our\r\npresent Christmas-tide, as an evidence that Old Christmas is the right\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBut we must not be too far led away by the legendary lore, much less the\r\npoetry connected with the whitethorn.\r\n\r\nWe come now to a description of the methods to be observed in planting\r\nfences, having taken for granted that quicks be employed for the\r\npurpose, and that we encourage the production of the sort best adapted\r\nto our purpose,—an end which, we conceive, will be well attained by\r\noffering prizes to nurserymen for good and well-grown quicks.\r\n\r\nIn planting hedges, then, our first care should be to prepare the\r\nground. This must be done according to the soil; and here it may be\r\nnoted that there are two plans of doing this most commonly used, namely,\r\nraising a mound, on which the quicks are to be planted without a ditch;\r\nand the making a ditch and planting the quicks on the top of the\r\nelevated soil. Now, curiously enough, the first method is the one\r\nusually adopted in light, porous soils, as on the sands of Dorsetshire;\r\nthe second, in porous stones, where ditches are not required, as in the\r\noolitic districts; or else in clay soils, where alone the ditch is at\r\nall advisable.\r\n\r\nWe advise that in light soils, as sandy loams, where drainage is not\r\nrequired, the ground be well dug on the flat before the planting of the\r\nquicks; that in thin soils on brashes the brash be loosened; and then\r\nthat some soil be carted on this surface, making an additional thickness\r\nof not more than six inches of soil. As regards the preparation for a\r\nfence, by previously making a ditch, we object to it on account of the\r\nloss of ground; the ditch, again, if forming part of the system of\r\ndrainage, is always liable to become choked by weeds, brambles, and the\r\nlike, with water-plants growing in it. Had we to begin the laying-out of\r\nground, we should make our drainage-system independent of the fences;\r\nand so, however stiff our clays if well drained, we should as a rule\r\nonly raise the soil where a fence was to be planted, by a few inches.\r\n\r\nWe speak the more strongly on this matter, because on our own farm we\r\nhave fences attempted to be grown on the top of mounds five feet high,\r\nand which are made out of some of the lightest agricultural soil in\r\nEngland, so light, indeed, as at first to appear to be a nearly pure\r\nsand. On the same farm, again, we have yawning ditches in oolitic\r\nlimestone, which never carried water; and Mr. Parkes made ditches of\r\nthis kind on the College-farm at Cirencester, which have ever been\r\nequally dry. These banks and ditches are worse than useless in our own\r\ncase: quicks will not grow at all; and so the bank is covered with all\r\nkinds of shrubs, mixed with weeds, neither sufficient to keep in cattle,\r\nnor prevent the workmen trespassing in every direction.\r\n\r\nThe next subject for consideration is that of the planting of the\r\nquicks. To this end we should choose our plants to be of about four or\r\nfive years old; and in all cases, if possible, should personally\r\nsuperintend their removal from the nursery. Old bundles of quicks, that\r\nhave stood it may be two or three weekly markets, will be sure to cause\r\ndisappointment. They should be removed so as to secure as many of the\r\nrootlets—not merely the larger roots—as possible.\r\n\r\nIn planting, which should be done as quickly as may be after removal,\r\navoid the dibble, or anything which would tend to combine the roots in a\r\nsmall compass. The best plan is to use the spade and to spread the roots\r\ncarefully; then cover them up, and tread the plants firmly into the\r\nground, taking care, if it be in a retentive soil, not to leave holes in\r\nwhich water could stagnate.\r\n\r\nWhen so planted, at about from six to nine inches, they should\r\nannually, or twice a year if necessary, be hoed and weeded and have the\r\nsurface-soil tolerably well stirred, and, usually at the end of about\r\nthe third or fourth year, be carefully cut down within six or eight\r\ninches of the ground, and the soil well stirred and manured. This would\r\nappear to be a waste of time; but a single year will restore the plants\r\nto even a greater height than before, and with all the elements for a\r\nthick impervious bottom, from which time annual careful trimming—always\r\nwhen the leaves have performed their functions and fall off—will be\r\nsufficient to keep the hedge in an improving state.\r\n\r\nWe have here advocated planting in single lines. Some, however, prefer\r\ndouble rows of quicks; but the latter are more difficult to keep clean\r\nand to cultivate; and we have ever seen that it is not the quantity, but\r\nthe quality and the after-treatment of the plants which result in the\r\ncompact and repellant hedge.\r\n\r\nOf course, all young hedges must be protected by a dead fence; and for\r\nthis purpose we prefer posts and rails of wood, or, if to keep back\r\nsheep, mixed with a line or two of hoop-iron: this, according to the\r\nsituation of the fence, will be required on only one or on both sides.\r\n\r\nIn planting young beech, or hornbeam, or any non-spinous plant, for\r\nhedges, it is advisable to cross the sets like a series of XXX’s,\r\noverlapping each other at about ten or twelve inches apart; by this\r\nmeans the branches interlace, and a compact fence, difficult to\r\npenetrate, will be formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _E.B. 2504._\r\n\r\nCratægus monogyna. Common White-thorn.]\r\n\r\nMaple may be used in the same way; but it never makes a strong fence,\r\nand it has not the advantage of the two former, as its leaves fall off\r\nat the approach of cold weather, which is not the case with either beech\r\nor hornbeam, whose leaves are eminently persistent, especially in the\r\nearlier part of their lives.\r\n\r\nIf furze hedges be required for any position, they may easily be grown,\r\neither by taking up young plants from the waste and planting them where\r\nwanted, or by sowing seed, which can readily be obtained from any\r\nseedsman.\r\n\r\nBefore sowing, the ground should be lightly dug, and the seeds, after\r\nbeing soaked for a few hours in water, be thinly sown, and be only just\r\ncovered up by the soil. This operation may be done in February; and when\r\nthe seeds come up, if they are covered over by branches of cut furze, or\r\nthese be stuck here and there in, or on, either side of the rows, the\r\nyoung plants will be protected from cattle and sheep, which are fond of\r\nnibbling the tender furze shoots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nWEEDS OF HEDGE-ROW FENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the hawthorn is usually recognized as the best plant for living\r\nfences for farm purposes, it will be expected that this has been almost\r\nexclusively employed; but, seeing that this is so, and has been so for\r\nmany years past, it is not a little interesting to trace in all hedges a\r\npredilection to grow anything else rather than that originally planted.\r\nOf course, with anything else we wished to grow, such interlopers would\r\nbe eradicated as weeds; but with hedges it would seem that all kinds of\r\nrubbish are left to accumulate, until a hedge originally all hawthorn\r\nhas become made up of extraneous matters, with occasional “gaps,” which\r\nare sure to occur where other plants are allowed, to the prejudice of\r\nthe quicks.

How this comes\r\nabout may be easily observed. Birds and other creatures are constantly\r\ntaking fruits of various plants to the hedge-rows, the seeds of which\r\nbeing dropped there, soon vegetate; and if shrubs with heavier twigs and\r\nbroader leaves once ascend into the hedge, they overshadow the smaller\r\nleaves of the quicks, and ultimately so discourage them that they all\r\nbut die out, and it is not at all difficult to see that the success of\r\nthe interlopers is only augmented by the injuries to the quicks.\r\n\r\nA more minute inquiry into the natural history and mode of operation of\r\nhedge-row weeds will be best preceded by a list of such plants as may be\r\nconsidered to act as weeds in a properly planted whitethorn hedge.\r\n\r\nIn doing this we may premise that, if our object has been to plant\r\nquicks, interlopers of all kinds, whether trees or shrubs—in fact, all\r\nbut the plant which we have purchased and planted—can scarcely be\r\nconsidered other than as weeds. To these interlopers, then, we may add\r\nthe following list, as containing a series of plants that will be,\r\nperhaps, more generally recognized as weeds:—\r\n\r\nLIST OF HEDGE-ROW WEEDS.\r\n\r\n  +---+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+\r\n  |No.|   Botanical Name.   |     Trivial Name.     |     Remarks.      |\r\n  +---+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+\r\n  | 1 |Salix species        |Willows, various       |                   |\r\n  | 2 |Berberis vulgaris    |Barberry               |}Spinous under-    |\r\n  | 3 |Rosa species         |Wild Roses (briars),   |}shrubs.           |\r\n  |   |                     |various                |}                  |\r\n  | 4 |Rubus species        |Brambles, various      | }Woody climbing   |\r\n  | 5 |Clematis vitalba     |Traveller’s Joy        | }plants.          |\r\n  | 6 |Hedera helix         |Ivy                    | }                 |\r\n  | 7 |Solanum dulcamara    |Bitter-sweet Nightshade|}Climbing          |\r\n  | 8 |Tamus communis       |Black Bryony           |}herbs,—mostly     |\r\n  | 9 |Bryonia dioica       |White Bryony           |}twisting around   |\r\n  |10 |Humulus lupulus      |Wild Hop               |}the stems of the  |\r\n  |11 |Convolvulus sepium   |Larger Bindweed        |}stronger hedge-   |\r\n  |12 |Galium species       |Bedstraw, various      |}plants.           |\r\n  |   |                     |                       |{Weeds of the lower|\r\n  |13 |Glechoma hederacea   |Ground Ivy             |{parts of hedges,  |\r\n  |14 |Geranium Robertianum |Herb, Robert Cranesbill|{which smother out |\r\n  |15 |Carduus varieties    |Various Thistles       |{young quicks, and |\r\n  |16 |Umbelliferæ varieties|Hedge Parsley, &c.     |{prevent the old   |\r\n  |17 |Graminaceæ varieties |Grasses                |{ones from being   |\r\n  |   |                     |                       |{thick at “bottom.”|\r\n  +---+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+\r\n\r\nAs regards the plants of this list, it will only be necessary to refer\r\nto a few of them, in order the more fully to impress the principles we\r\nhave laid down.\r\n\r\nThe roses (briars) and brambles, though spinous, are yet short-lived; so\r\nthat their old wood is continually dying out, thus causing gaps,\r\ninasmuch as such heavily-foliaged plants necessarily prevent the growth\r\nof the whitethorn or any other tolerable hedge-plant. But, besides this,\r\nthe bramble has the propensity to root at the ends of its long flexile\r\nbranches, and so spreads the pest in every direction, not escaping the\r\nditch when it forms part of the fence, that the whole becomes smothered\r\nup in a tangled, inextricable mass, always out of order and unsightly,\r\nmaking but a poor fence, though affording shelter to hares, rabbits, and\r\nother farm pests.\r\n\r\nThe clematis and ivy are large-foliaged plants, and their pliant stems\r\ninterlace on the hedge in such a manner as most surely to kill out the\r\nquicks, and so to become the usurping tenants; but, no sooner have they\r\nattained the mastery than they begin to decay, whole branches die, and\r\nthe result is a gap, which must either be patched up with thorns or be\r\nnewly planted, and then fenced with post and rails. As regards mending\r\ngaps with thorns, we ought to state that we view it as decidedly\r\ninjurious,—as dead matter in proximity with the living only prevents the\r\ngrowth of the latter: at best it is only a makeshift, which soon gets\r\nrotten, and tempts the petty wood-pilferer to pull the hedge further to\r\npieces for the sake of a few dry sticks.\r\n\r\nWith regard to those plants of which we may take the bryony and the hop\r\nas the types, it is true that their bine is annual; but each year the\r\nquantity and strength of this augments—each year the mass of foliage\r\nbecomes larger and thicker. The twining arms twist around any branch\r\nstrong enough to support them, and then, once at the top of the fence,\r\nthey spread over its surface, making so thick a mass that the legitimate\r\nhedge-plants are no longer visible; thus sun and air are excluded from\r\nthem, and they soon pine away. These are difficult to eradicate, as they\r\nhave stout rhizomata (underground stems) interlaced with the very roots\r\nof the hedge-plants: still, if pains be taken to pluck away the bine as\r\nsoon as it makes its appearance, it must in time be destroyed; for, like\r\neven the hawthorn tree, hardy as it is, if the leaves be kept from\r\nperfecting themselves, they soon pine away, and ultimately die\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nThe other plants are more properly weeds of the hedge-bank than of the\r\nhedge, and as such need only be mentioned with weeds in general as pests\r\nto be periodically removed by hoeing, digging, and otherwise clearing\r\nthe ground between and about the hedge-row work, more particularly\r\nnecessary in the first few years of planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nON HEDGE-ROW TIMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the many sources of mischief to which the farmer may be liable, we\r\ncan conceive none greater than that of being overgrown with hedge-row\r\ntimber. It is scarcely, if at all, second to that of being overstocked\r\nwith game—for as regards game, there is a chance of getting some\r\ncompensation for palpable injury; but the mischief which trees silently\r\nbut surely effect, when surrounding fields, is never allowed for, as it\r\nis not fully appreciated by the tenant, and never admitted by the\r\nlandlord; and so as hedge-row timber is usually thicker in the richer\r\nparts of the country, it is somehow considered as an evidence of\r\nfertility on the one hand, while it is looked upon as a legitimate mode\r\nof increasing income on the other.\r\n\r\nBut we are quite sure that hedge-row timber is almost useless in itself,\r\nand a pest to all who must live under it. Hedges themselves are usually\r\ntoo many, and these too thick through them; and when it comes to be\r\nunderstood that the enclosures are smaller, the hedges often greater,\r\nand hedge-row timber thicker on good than on bad lands, some idea may be\r\nformed of the mischief which is inflicted by thus hemming in fine land\r\nfrom light and air.\r\n\r\nThe following tables, by Mr. J. Bravender, land-surveyor, of\r\nCirencester, are the results of an “examination of the fields contained\r\nin 120 parishes:”—\r\n\r\nTABLE OF ADMEASUREMENT OF FENCES.\r\n\r\n  +---------------+--------+--------+---------+--------+---------+--------+\r\n  |               |Average |        | Length  |        |Quantity |Quantity|\r\n  |Geological     |quantity| Length |   of    | Width  |occupied |  per   |\r\n  |Formation, &c. |  of    |   of   |fencing, |   of   |by fences|hundred |\r\n  |               | each   |fencing.|per acre.|fencing.|per acre.| acres. |\r\n  |               | field. |        |         |        |   [24]  |        |\r\n  +---------------+--------+--------+---------+--------+---------+--------+\r\n  |               | Acres. | Chains.| Chains. | Links. |Perches. | Acres. |\r\n  | 1.

Now, if we inquire into the nature of these evils, we shall find\r\nthat they result from shade, drip, and exhaustion by roots.\r\n\r\nThere are those who speak in favour of hedge-row timber as affording\r\nshade for cattle; but we should remember that when this is so, the\r\ncattle, by being thus gathered to one spot, only aid in manuring those\r\nportions of the field where the grass is always more rank than\r\nnutritious, and this to the robbery of other portions of the field. For\r\nourselves, we would rather have our fields exposed to the influence of\r\nsun and air, and, if required, have some contrivances for shade which\r\ncould be moved about the fields at pleasure. The shade of trees keeps\r\noff those refreshing showers so important to vegetation, but in much wet\r\nthe trees send down a drip which is sometimes found to be so injurious\r\nas to prevent any good growth beneath them, and then as the leaves fall\r\noff they often poison the soil for some distance, while the roots\r\nimpoverish the land in every direction.\r\n\r\nWe have just visited a field, in the southern hedge of which are\r\ngrowing some beech trees; these not only keep off the southern sun, but\r\ntheir drip and fallen leaves render fully one-eighth of the field nearly\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nAgain, do we not everywhere find twice the number of hedges that are\r\nrequired; and, to add to the mischief, these filled with trees? In many\r\nplaces we see elms not more than three yards apart. Here the shade would\r\nbe intolerable, but the farmer is allowed to lop them until they look\r\nnot unlike the stuck-up tails of French poodle dogs—a process which\r\ncertainly diminishes the evils they entail upon the farmer, but renders\r\nthe timber comparatively useless.\r\n\r\nBut, say the advocates of tall hedges and hedge-row timber, “How\r\nbeautiful they make the country look! Your plan would leave it all bare\r\nand desolate; no song of birds to cheer the wayfarer,” &c. But stop,\r\ngood people; we love trees, but we do not care so much for straight\r\nlines of stuck-up _besoms_. Let the landlord grow his woods and his\r\ngroves, and plant his parks. Let him put trees in parts which will grow\r\nnothing better, and in belts to keep off malignant winds; and even here\r\n(the best places for them), let him be content with their pleasure and\r\nprofit as a rent for the ground they occupy, and not, as some do, insist\r\nupon the tenant yearly planting trees in positions which must injure so\r\nmuch land which he is still to pay rent for. This is about as tyrannical\r\nas to make a schoolboy carry a birch, and ask for its application.\r\n\r\nAs regards the loss of land by the division into smaller fields, we\r\ncannot do better than copy the former outlines of an arable field on our\r\nown farm. This, which is now one field of over fifty acres, was\r\nformerly in fifteen fenced fields, each with a ragged hedge—of anything\r\nbut quicks—planted upon raised mounds. Now, the gain in the removal of\r\nfences, indicated by the dotted lines (see fig. 1), may be explained by\r\nthe following calculations:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. _Field with its old divisions, now removed, as\r\nmarked by the dotted lines._]\r\n\r\n                                                        Acr. Rds.\r\n  Ground, 2 yards wide, occupied by the mounds and\r\n  hedges, about                                          1    2\r\n\r\n  One foot and a half on either side of the\r\n  mounds which cannot be ploughed, about                 0    3\r\n                                                        --------\r\n            Total of gain in 50 acres                    2    1\r\n                   Or, per cent., 4a. 2r.\r\n\r\nFrom these data, then, we may conclude that if available land equal in\r\nextent to a county may be gained by keeping fences within bounds, this\r\nmay be more than doubled by grubbing up, not merely useless, but\r\nmischievous fences, and discountenancing the growth of hedge-row timber.\r\n\r\nNow, although we reside in the county of the Dorsetshire poet, we are\r\nnot of those who would curtail the privileges of the poor by closing up\r\nall footpaths, or by too rigidly curtailing the road space; but as long\r\nas the farmer has to pay rent for the ground needlessly occupied by\r\nbadly-constructed hedge-rows, we think it due to him, and even to the\r\npoor themselves, that land now so occupied should in future be made\r\nfood-producing; and with these sentiments we would conclude this chapter\r\nby quoting the following\r\n\r\nDORSETSHIRE DITTY.\r\n\r\n(_From Poems by William Barnes._)\r\n\r\n    “They do zay that a travellin chap\r\n      Have a-put in the newspeäper now\r\n    That the bit o’ green ground on the knap\r\n      Should be all a-took in vor the plough.\r\n    He do fancy ’tis easy to show\r\n      That we can be but stunpolls at best,\r\n    Vor to leäve a green spot where a flower can grow\r\n      Or a foot-weary walker mid rest.\r\n    ’Tis hedge-grubbèn, Thomas, an’ ledge-grubbèn\r\n      Never a done,\r\n    While a sov’rèn mwore’s to be won.\r\n\r\n    “The road, he do zay, is so wide\r\n      As ’tis wanted vor travellers’ wheels;\r\n    As if all that did travel did ride,\r\n      An’ did never get galls on their heels.\r\n    He would leäve sich a thin strip o’ groun’\r\n      That if a man’s veet in his shoes\r\n    Wer a-burnèn an’ zore, why he coulden zit down\r\n      But the wheels would run over his tooes.\r\n    Vor ’tis meäke money, Thomas, an’ teäke money,\r\n      What’s zwold an’ bought\r\n    Is all that is worthy o’ thought.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    “The children will soon have noo pleäce\r\n      Vor to play in, an’ if they do grow,\r\n    They will have a thin musheroom feäce,\r\n      Wi’ their bodies so sumple as dough.\r\n    But a man is a meäde ov a child\r\n      An’ his limbs do grow worksome by play,\r\n    An’ if the young child’s little body’s a-spweil’d,\r\n      Why, the man’s wull the zooner decay.\r\n    But wealth is wo’th now mwore than health is wo’th;\r\n      Let it all goo\r\n    If ’t ’ull bring but a sov’rèn or two.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nON THE VERMIN OF FENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the great objections urged to more hedge-row fences than are\r\nnecessary, is that of harbouring _Vermin_; it therefore becomes\r\nnecessary to inquire into the history of those creatures designated by a\r\nname everywhere held in reproach.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the term vermin has not been very accurately defined.\r\nJohnson considers “any noxious animal” to belong to vermin; whilst\r\nBailey, anxious to be more specific, defines vermin to be “any kind of\r\nhurtful creature or insect, as rats, mice, lice, fleas, bugs, &c.;” but\r\nwhatever lexicographers may say upon the subject, there can be no doubt\r\nthat, in country language, what are known as noxious animals are\r\ndistinguished from noxious insects, the first being in most counties\r\nknown as “Varment,” to which belong rats, mice, stoats, &c., to which\r\nthe keeper would add kites, hawks, owls, magpies, and other birds; the\r\nsecond term being limited to those parasitic creatures by which both man\r\nand some inferior animals may be attacked.\r\n\r\nThe farmer’s notion of vermin, as applied to the hedge-row, differs from\r\nthese, as it includes all beasts, birds, reptiles, insects, &c., which\r\ndirectly injure the hedge, together with such as choose the hedge-row or\r\nthe bank on which it might be grown as a breeding-place, from which they\r\nmigrate to farm crops, and so become injurious, not to the hedge alone,\r\nbut to the farm in general.\r\n\r\nSome notion of these may be inferred from the following list:—\r\n\r\n  1. _Rabbits_—By burrowing in the hedge-bank.\r\n\r\n  2. _Hedge-hog_—Ignorantly included with hedge-row vermin\r\n     by the farmer.\r\n\r\n  3. {_Stoats_} These burrow or make the hedge-row or bank\r\n     {_Rats_  } a place of refuge and concealment.\r\n     {_Mice_  }\r\n\r\n  4. _Snakes_—Erroneously supposed to be injurious.\r\n\r\n  5. {_Slugs_ } Both breed extensively in hedge-rows, which\r\n     {_Snails_} often form these hybernacula.\r\n\r\n     {_Insects_ injurious to the growing hedge-plants.\r\n     {  _Do._   protected by the hedge, and migrating to the\r\n  6. {          farm crops.\r\n     {  _Do._   harboured by hedge-row weeds, and thence\r\n     {          migrating to the crops.\r\n\r\n  7. _Birds_ in general, according to the dictum of the Sparrow\r\n     Clubbists.\r\n\r\n1. The rabbit is one of the greatest pests to the bank on which hedges\r\nare too often grown, and therefore is injurious to the growing hedge, to\r\nsay nothing of the mischief which these creatures do to the crops. The\r\nother day we visited a field in which a hedge-bank had been undermined\r\nwith no less than fifty holes in the distance of five-and-twenty yards;\r\nthese ramified in every direction, not only through the raised mound,\r\nbut into the fields on either side of the hedge, and out of which\r\nrabbits were dug from a depth of as much as four feet. Here the\r\nridiculous nature of the mound was the primary cause of the mischief,\r\nand hence we here offer an illustration of the general facts which met\r\nour view:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Diagram of a Mound and Ditch in Oolite Sands._\r\n\r\n                                                       ft. in.\r\n  _a._ A rabbit hole.\r\n  1. and 5.

The hedge-hog is here only mentioned in the hope of dispelling a\r\npopular prejudice with regard to him. He is ruthlessly destroyed as\r\nvermin, on the supposition that the hedge screens a traitor who is ever\r\nready to suck eggs or to take a meal from the cow’s udder. Now, as\r\nregards the first charge, one would have thought that, from the\r\npertinacity displayed by those who bring it in destroying birds’ eggs\r\nand birds of every kind, they would have little care upon this head.\r\nHis sucking of cows has never been witnessed by any competent observer,\r\nand with such the idea was never entertained, nor can it be supposed\r\nthat a cow would suffer the approach of a creature so thoroughly armed\r\nwith spines as the hedge-hog. In the words of Yarrell we may conclude\r\nthat “this is about as well-founded an accusation as that of Pliny,\r\nexaggerated as it is by Sperling, who assures us that it ascends trees,\r\nknocks off the apples and pears, and, throwing itself down upon them\r\nthat they may stick to its spines, trots off with the prize! Ælian gives\r\nus the same story, substituting figs for apples, and omitting the\r\nclimbing power of the animal.”\r\n\r\n3. This section contains creatures for which few of us entertain any\r\naffection; at the same time, it may perhaps be true that some of the\r\ngreatest of farm pests, in the shapes of rats and mice, have greatly\r\nincreased since the destruction of the polecat, stoat, and other of our\r\nsmaller carnivorous quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nAs regards mice in general, one source of alarm connected with their\r\nformer occupancy of the hedge-row has nearly vanished from among us. We\r\nallude to the supposed injury they were thought to inflict on any\r\ncreature over which they might creep.\r\n\r\nAt one time, if a cow or sheep offered any symptom of paralysis or\r\ninjury, more particularly of the hind-quarters, the creature was said to\r\nbe “mouse-crope,” for which were several popular remedies, which were\r\nused by way of direct applications, such as a liberal application of\r\nrods of wytch-hazel, drawing twigs of mountain-ash or rowan-tree over\r\nthe affected parts; but the more general plan of action was to operate\r\nupon the offending creature upon the same principle as pertains to the\r\npresent day in the case of a bite by a dog—namely, that the bitten\r\nsubject is not safe from the direst calamities so long as the author of\r\nthe mischief is alive; and acting upon this, there are few persons in\r\nrural districts who would not demand the death of a dog by whom they may\r\nhave been bitten, and this not as a measure of precaution, to prevent\r\nthe like occurrence happening again, but as the first thing to be done\r\nto ensure a safe cure. So with a “mouse-crope” subject: action was at\r\nonce taken against the mouse, but this through the agency of the\r\n“shrew-ash,” which potent remedy is thus described by Gilbert White, in\r\nhis charming “Natural History of Selborne:”—\r\n\r\n     Now, a shrew-ash is an ash whose twigs or branches, when gently\r\n     applied to the limbs of cattle, will immediately relieve the pains\r\n     which a beast suffers from the running of a shrew-mouse over the\r\n     part affected; for it is supposed that a shrew-mouse is of so\r\n     baneful and deleterious a nature, that wherever it creeps over a\r\n     beast, be it horse, cow, or sheep, the suffering animal is\r\n     afflicted with cruel anguish, and threatened with the loss of the\r\n     use of the limb. Against this accident, to which they were\r\n     continually liable, our provident forefathers always kept a\r\n     shrew-ash at hand, which, when properly medicated, would maintain\r\n     its virtue for ever. A shrew-ash was made thus:—Into the body of\r\n     the tree a deep hole was bored with an augur, and a poor devoted\r\n     shrew-mouse was thrust in alive, and plugged in, no doubt, with\r\n     several quaint incantations, long since forgotten.\r\n\r\nThat the shrew-mouse was generally held in the greatest dread, there is\r\nno doubt; but, we find in Dorsetshire, where this notion still prevails,\r\nthat the idea of mischief is not confined to the shrew, but is believed\r\nof any mouse. We had a steer in one of our feeding-pits, which, as he\r\ndid not gain flesh, was said to be “moss-crop,” the western vernacular\r\nfor mouse-crope. Still, field mice, without regard to species, are\r\nsupposed to be the most baneful in this way; at the same time, we may\r\ntrace an evidence of the former generally prevailing belief in the\r\ninjurious tendencies of even our common mouse, in the fact that when you\r\nhave so far convinced a lady friend, who may have a “horror of a mouse,”\r\nof their harmless nature, you are sure to be met with the unanswerable\r\nremark, which gains point from the manner of its utterance, “But suppose\r\na mouse should creep over me?” We may now entirely discard every notion\r\nof the evils of mouse-crope cattle as an argument against the hedge-row\r\nas a harbour for rats and mice; still, these are vermin in the true\r\nsense of the word, and which hedge-rows, unless kept trim and clean at\r\nbottom, are sure to encourage.\r\n\r\n4. Snakes in hedge-rows are very common, and especially on banks facing\r\nthe south; of these, the common ringed snake and the slow-worm are often\r\nmet with. They excite great terror in most people; but still they may be\r\nsaid not merely to be quite harmless, but absolutely useful, as they\r\nlive upon insects and small fry in general, and so, in reality, they\r\nought not to be classed as vermin, but take their place amongst their\r\nmost decided enemies.\r\n\r\n5. The land mollusks, to which belong the snail and the slug, are\r\nsheltered in hedges by thousands; and highly destructive they are, and\r\nmore especially in small overshadowed enclosures. The quantity of\r\nvegetation which these consume is enormous, and we are sorry to think\r\nthat they are on the increase—a fact which we deem to be due to the\r\nindiscriminate slaughter of small birds, more especially the blackbird,\r\nthrush, and lark, which are their most determined enemies. As farmers,\r\nwe might well afford them a dessert of small fruit for the good they do\r\nin destroying slugs and snails.\r\n\r\n6. Hedge-row shrubs are liable to be injured by many insects, more\r\nespecially the caterpillars of different kinds of moths and butterflies,\r\nwhich sometimes eat away all their leaves, and so greatly retard the\r\ngrowth of the hedge. Upon this subject we quote from “Our Woodlands,\r\nHeaths, and Hedges,” for the purpose of introducing to our readers a\r\nsmall book by W. S. Coleman, which should be in the hands of all country\r\nreaders:—\r\n\r\n     The foliage of the hawthorn, remarkable for its elegance, is the\r\n     chosen food of a great number of interesting insects, principally\r\n     the caterpillars of various _lepidoptera_.\r\n\r\n     Several species of these are of a gregarious nature, living\r\n     together in extensive colonies under a thick net-work of silk,\r\n     which serves them for a common protection while feeding on the\r\n     foliage enclosed with themselves in a silken tent.\r\n\r\n     Among these social net-weavers are the caterpillars of a fine\r\n     insect, the black-veined white butterfly (_Pieris cratægi_), a\r\n     rarity in some districts, but in certain localities, and at certain\r\n     periods, abounding to such an extent as entirely to strip the\r\n     hawthorn hedges of their foliage. Similar depredations are\r\n     committed by the gaily-coloured progeny of the common lackey moth,\r\n     and of the gold-tailed and brown-tailed moths; but the most\r\n     formidable devastators, though the tiniest individually, are the\r\n     little ermine moths (_Yponomenta_), small silvery-grey creatures,\r\n     minutely spotted with black. The curious twig-like caterpillars of\r\n     the brimstone moth (a pretty canary-coloured creature, with brown\r\n     markings), and of several other geometers, are common upon\r\n     hawthorn.\r\n\r\nLast summer (1864), the hawthorn trees and hedges about the parks and\r\nsquares of London were entirely defoliated by caterpillars, which\r\nprogressed from tree to tree in squads of numberless individuals, only\r\nseeking a new site of action when the former one had been despoiled of\r\nevery vestige of leaf and bud.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only the hawthorn which becomes attacked by insects: all\r\nother hedge-row trees and shrubs have their peculiar enemies, to\r\ndescribe which would take more space than we have to spare, and we\r\ntherefore conclude the chapter with a few remarks upon the weeds of\r\ndirty hedge-rows. These harbour various insects, which migrate to our\r\ncrops, and do an immense amount of injury. For instance, such plants as\r\nJack by the Hedge (_Erysimum alliaria_), treacle mustard (_Sisymbrium\r\nofficinale_), wild mustards, and other forms of _Cruciferæ_, in\r\nhedge-rows, afford a winter nidus for the turnip flea beetles (_Haltica\r\nconcinna_ and _H. nemorum_),[25] from which they take their flight to\r\nthe more delicate turnip and swede crops as soon as these come up.\r\n\r\n[25] See _How to Grow Good Roots_, pp. 43 and 44 of the present work.\r\n\r\nBirds need only here be mentioned incidentally, as there is still a\r\nconflict of opinions as to the use of the bird family to the farmer; and\r\nthose species which mostly build in and frequent our hedges are perhaps\r\nthose upon which evil suspicions are most universally held. Amongst\r\nthese are the hedge-sparrow, finch, linnet, and others—and that these\r\nare mischievous at times, we are not prepared to deny; but we should be\r\nsorry if the curtailment of hedges, for which we are advocates, should\r\nresult in the destruction of our small birds, as we conclude most of the\r\nspecies to be at times eminently useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nON THE MANAGEMENT OF HEDGE-ROW FENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall, in the first place, treat the subject of management in\r\nreference to fences composed of hawthorn. In the newly-planted hedge we\r\nshall find that the better the soil in which it is planted, the quicker\r\nand stronger the young quicks will grow. If, then, the soil be not good,\r\nor if it be thin, it will be worth while to prepare it as well as\r\ncircumstances will permit. This may be done by deep digging, by bringing\r\ngood soil from a distance, or some aid may be given by means of any kind\r\nof manure. It should ever be borne in mind that to start with luxuriant\r\ngrowth is all-important, as neglect in this matter at first can only be\r\npartially remedied afterwards.\r\n\r\nGood quicks, selected and removed with care, carefully planted in\r\nwell-prepared ground, not elevated several feet on a dry sand-bank, or\r\ncarelessly grouted in a gutter of clay, will soon send out vigorous\r\nshoots. These should be well weeded and dug at least for three or four\r\nyears, during which time an occasional trimming of a wild shoot here and\r\nthere with the knife will rightly direct a more even growth.\r\n\r\nIn weeding, the first advent of briars and brambles should be looked to;\r\nso all seedling ash, elder, maple, and defenceless trees in general,\r\nshould be _taken out by the roots_, not cut off, as this only makes a\r\nthicket of a twig.\r\n\r\nAfter three or four years, if the growth be sufficiently strong, the\r\nyoung hedge may be trimmed to a desired shape with the shears or the\r\nhook; but if weak and straggling, we would strongly recommend that the\r\nwhole be boldly cut off within a few inches of the base, the ground to\r\nbe well dug and even manured about the roots, and the protecting\r\nrailings to be put in order, and a new growth be waited for, which,\r\ngenerally speaking, will not be long—for by this means we believe that a\r\ngood fence will be sooner arrived at than by allowing weak wood to go on\r\ngrowing still weaker.\r\n\r\nHawthorn fences are sometimes allowed to get several feet high before\r\nbeing brought into reasonable dimensions, in which case they get smooth,\r\nunarmed, and unbranched stems at the base. This state of things is too\r\noften attempted to be cured by cutting out a quantity of the wood and\r\nlaying the rest, by partially dividing them near the ground—a plan which\r\nis called “plashing.” This we think highly objectionable: it would be\r\nfar better to cut off the whole to within a few inches of the ground,\r\nand so trim the shoots as they grow again.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that plashing gets out of order, the layered sticks get\r\nout of place, and the whole is aided by stakes of dead wood, which soon\r\ndecay, or, if not, are almost certain to be removed by the constant\r\ncountry claimants to dead sticks in general.\r\n\r\nWe prefer that no dead materials should be put to a living fence; for if\r\nthere are gaps, it will be best to dig the ground well and put in some\r\nyoung quicks, fencing with posts and rails, to guard the plants as well\r\nas impound the cattle. Mending gaps with thorns only aggravates the\r\nevil, as the living part of the fence is so interfered with by the dead\r\nmatter that it grows but imperfectly, and the dead materials soon rot\r\naway, leaving a greater gap to be re-mended.\r\n\r\nWe have seen gaps tried to be repaired by old quicks, but this seldom\r\nsucceeds—for if they grow, they are never bushy enough to be repellant;\r\nbut they often die altogether, and at best with old plants, young quicks\r\nwill repair the mischief in less time.\r\n\r\nSeeing the difficulty there is sometimes in getting quicks to grow well\r\nin hedge gaps, it is not uncommon to fill up with various kinds of\r\nhedge-row plants, such as hazel, whitebeam, spindle-tree, dogwood,\r\nmaple, &c.; but the objection to these is, that they are often not\r\nrepellant in any way, and they help to make weaker places broader than\r\nthey found them, and, indeed, ultimately get possession of the greater\r\npart of the hedge-row. There is, then, nothing better to mend a\r\nwhitethorn hedge than quicks, and they will grow if attended to for the\r\nfirst two or three years; but why they usually fail is, that if planted\r\nin gaps they are usually closely hemmed in by old thorns, or allowed to\r\nbecome smothered by weeds.\r\n\r\nWith respect to very old hedges, made up of all sorts of materials, we\r\nprefer cutting them down about three feet from the ground, leaving all\r\nthe stubs to branch out, than to attempt to layer as shrubs, and then\r\nthe whitethorn succeeds even less with plashing. Where, however, we have\r\nrough, but, after all, not repellant fences, we should like to see them\r\nre-planted, by which they could mostly be curtailed, and at the same\r\ntime opportunity may be taken to get rid of some of them altogether, or\r\nto make them in a more convenient direction.\r\n\r\nWe are now in possession of a hedge composed of everything but hawthorn,\r\nand somewhere about twelve feet high. It is without gaps, but still\r\npregnable at any point, by reason of the want of armature in the shrubs\r\nof which it is composed. Still, as it stands on the top of a bank five\r\nfeet high, the mound and hedge together is not so bad a fence as its\r\nmaterials might warrant.\r\n\r\nWe here give a list of the plants of which this fence is composed, in\r\norder to the more clear explanation of what is to follow:—\r\n\r\nPLANTS IN A HEDGE AT BRADFORD ABBAS, ON THE INFERIOR OOLITE.\r\n\r\n                        Parts.\r\n\r\n  Ash                     4 }\r\n  Hazel                  20 } The whole\r\n  Cornel                 10 } intermixed\r\n  Spindle-tree           12 } with long\r\n  Blackthorn              6 } climbing brambles\r\n  Maple                  20 } and straggling\r\n  Mealy Guelder Rose      5 } briars, and the\r\n  Clematis                2 } bank covered with\r\n  Elder                   3 } the usual hedge-row\r\n  Elm                     3 } weeds.\r\n  Whitethorn              2 }\r\n\r\nNow, here is a tall hedge on the north side of our field, and so capable\r\nof affording no slight amount of shelter to stock; but how much southern\r\nsun does it keep off our neighbour’s field! And yet we have just\r\nsucceeded to a lease which contains a clause compelling this hedge to\r\nbe annually trimmed—a process which has not been performed for many\r\nyears, but which we shall hereafter show should be done, especially\r\nwhere hedges have been properly cared for, for the due keeping of the\r\nfence itself; but further, we feel convinced that a proprietor should be\r\nable to call upon the owner of a neighbouring estate to keep his portion\r\nof the fences within such bounds as may not be injurious.\r\n\r\nIn the case before us, what is best to be done? Custom says, “Lay it;\r\nplash it.” Still, the materials are not suitable for this process. “Cut\r\nit down and it will shoot up again,” says the hedger, who would be ready\r\nto do the work for the wood; but mark, that in order to get as much as\r\npossible, it would be cut close to the ground. Our plan will be to cut\r\nit at about a yard from the top of the mound, and afterwards to watch\r\nthe young shoots, so as carefully to trim them, in order to induce them\r\nto throw out laterals, and thus make, at least, a thick growth, though\r\nof unpromising materials.\r\n\r\nWith regard to trimming by the piece: if it be really a well-grown\r\nquick-set hedge, the keeping it to a certain standard may be easily\r\naccomplished; but if it be a weakly growth of all kinds of shrubs, the\r\nlabourer slashes as close to the ground as he can with the hook, in\r\norder to “have something to cut against”—a process which only makes the\r\nhedges weaker the oftener it is performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nCOVENANTS WITH REGARD TO FENCES, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what has been already advanced, it will be seen that the matter of\r\nfences is most important in connection with the arrangements between\r\nlandlord and tenant.\r\n\r\nThe landlord for the most part gets the same rent for the land occupied\r\nby fences as for the whole of the field, such land being calculated with\r\nthe acreage; and, further, with the tenant-at-will he insists upon their\r\nbeing kept in order—that is, if he cares for or knows anything about\r\norder—at the expense of the tenant. In leases there are usually inserted\r\ncovenants obliging annual trimming of fences and scouring of ditches;\r\nbut, generally speaking, the tenant does just as much as he likes, and\r\nthe landlord knows but little about it. At the same time, annual\r\ntrimming of hedges would often be mischievous; and again, as some hedges\r\nwould be well to be let grow tall, on account of the shelter they might\r\nafford, there will be so many circumstances to be considered in coming\r\nto a right conclusion about what should be done to fences, that it is no\r\nwonder that covenants are only insisted upon in a very partial manner,\r\nand the careless farmer, instead of repairing hedges in a permanent\r\nmanner, is content to mend gaps—or “shards,” as they are called in the\r\nmidland counties—only when he wants to keep his beasts in any\r\nparticular meadow or field.\r\n\r\nWe shall shortly discuss these views under the following heads:—\r\n\r\n1. Fences should not be kept up to a greater extent than is required.\r\n\r\n2. A tenant-at-will should not be expected to plant or take charge of\r\nfences.\r\n\r\n3. Evils of bad fences.\r\n\r\n1. The curtailment and removal of fences is, as already shown, a matter\r\nof great moment, not only as providing more available land for\r\ncultivation, but as exposing a greater surface even of the cultivated\r\nportions of fields to the influence of light and air. But on any estate\r\nwhere this has been deemed advisable, we have usually seen that as the\r\nwork has been, as it were, divided amongst the tenants, it has either\r\nbeen done without judgment, or, if performed well, yet by men of\r\ndifferent views, as having different requirements, so that it has\r\nresulted in a patchy and anything rather than an uniform improvement.\r\n\r\nWe would advise that the landlord or his agent take charge of this\r\nmatter, with a view to that uniform improvement which would affect the\r\nwhole estate. In this case it would be to the interest of the proprietor\r\nto make the run of the fences as straight as possible, to plant quicks,\r\nto mend gaps, and properly to fence them with rails. Were this the case,\r\nwe should hardly see gaps filled up with dead materials, only to widen\r\nthem as time advances by killing more of the living wood, or, what is\r\neven worse, left as roadways to tempt the trespasser. In fine, as the\r\nestate would be improved by having perfect fences, and therefore would\r\nfetch a better rent, it would appear to be the landlord’s duty to see it\r\nattended to, and not to expect to charge a tenant for bad fences, and to\r\ninsist upon his constantly mending them into the bargain, or it will\r\nnaturally follow that they will seldom be up to a high standard of\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\n2. A tenant-at-will, or even a leaseholder, should not be expected to\r\nplant new fences, or to cultivate those already planted, when it\r\ninvolves expenses from which he cannot reap the benefit. In the first\r\nplace, it is not only the planting, but weeding and pruning—not merely\r\nslashing—that is required, all involving time, expense, and judgment,\r\nwhich no man would be justified in expending upon a precarious holding.\r\n\r\nBut take the case of a leaseholder for seven years. In our own parish,\r\non the light oolite sands, is a quick-set hedge, which has been badly\r\nplanted—now entering upon the fourth year since—upon the top of a thin\r\nmound of sandy soil, from four to five feet high. The quicks are not so\r\ngood as when they were planted; it can _never_ make a good hedge. Briars\r\nand brambles, and various shrubs common to oolite soils, will smother\r\nout the quicks, and altogether it will result in failure. Here the\r\nlandlord should not expect his tenant to weed, and it is not worth his\r\nwhile to even find “rough timber” for forming a defence of such a hedge\r\nfrom the cattle, nor will it pay the tenant to employ a carpenter to\r\nwork it. In this case the landlord should level the soil and re-plant\r\nthe hedge—not on a mound of sand, but in the well-dug surface\r\nsoil—efficiently fence it, and see to its annual weeding. In this way,\r\ninstead of his having to find rough timber for fences for all time, one\r\nset of rails should be enough, and so he would ultimately save money for\r\ntime by a present judicious expenditure; and, besides, as he would give\r\nhis tenant more available land for his acreage, and this better secured,\r\nso that trespassers are kept from without and his cattle prevented\r\nstraying from within, the holding would certainly be more valuable.\r\n\r\n3. With bad fences the land is not at command. There has to be\r\nsuperintendence and mending whenever a field is wanted to be used. We\r\nrecollect a farmer who, having bought some pigs, on being asked by his\r\nman where he was to put ’em, replied, “Oh, put ’em in the garden, for if\r\nyou don’t they’ll very soon get there.”\r\n\r\nHere was a case of bad fences about the homestead, and we may be sure\r\neverywhere else too. And here we would controvert the assertion that is\r\ntoo often made, that “the farmer who is a careful gardener will be a bad\r\nfarmer.” We have ever seen that attention to neatness and order, at home\r\nand in the fields, will mark the good farmer, though it may not always\r\nassure us of the prosperous one. The truth is, that neatness is\r\nsometimes expensive; and as it does not always yield any greater reward\r\nthan gratification to the tenant, it should at all times be encouraged\r\nby the landlord with every possible assistance, as he can never be a\r\nloser thereby, but must be the gainer.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that there is nothing about estates or farms which so much\r\nrequires remodelling as the system of fences. They want lessening, as\r\nthe land is cut up into far too many awkward little pieces. They want\r\nstraightening and paralleling, if we may so express it. They should,\r\ntoo, be kept within due compass, both as to breadth and height, so that\r\naltogether, as to material, mode of planting, position, and general\r\nsupervision, the hedge-row really is in want of that kind of treatment\r\nwhich only a far-seeing, comprehensive overseer can direct, and which,\r\nwere we to come into the possession of a large estate, would be the\r\nfirst process for its amelioration and improvement that we should attend\r\nto.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it may be said that this subject is daily receiving a greater\r\nshare of attention, and that for a reason at first little suspected; but\r\nthe truth is, steam is asserting its power on the farm as on the road,\r\nand as the engine marches into our fields, fences will be levelled\r\nbefore his mightiness—all sorts of crooked corners and queer-shaped\r\nangles will be removed, and the whole will assume a more regular\r\noutline.\r\n\r\nThere are moral evils connected with bad fences which we think have\r\nhardly been duly considered. We have hinted at their encouragement of\r\ntrespassers and fostering of idle habits.\r\n\r\nIn our own parish are gaps leading from one field and from one farm to\r\nanother. This encourages idle vagabonds to go anywhere—everywhere—on\r\npretence of shooting small birds, many of which are often of more value\r\nthan themselves; and if there is no gap already, how easy to push\r\nthrough twigs of cornel, ash, guelder rose, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nSuch hedges, again, are mended with dead thorns and stakes and rails of\r\nwood, which soon decay and become a prey to all the old women and idle\r\nchildren in the parish, the latter of whom hasten the period when they\r\nmay claim them by climbing through and over them, and so prematurely\r\ndespoil what they soon take home as of right.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, then, we hazard the assertion that well-grown and\r\nwell-kept fences are a boon to all. They benefit the landlord, by\r\nenabling him to give well-secured acres in exchange for his rent. Like\r\ngood “buildings,” fences benefit the farmer by affording him protection\r\nfor his property. They benefit the poor, by removing a great source of\r\nlawless habits, and that commencement of petty larceny which too often\r\nleads to a complete negation of conscience.\r\n\r\nThey benefit all, inasmuch as Order, which “is Heaven’s first law,” is\r\nMan’s best friend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate I.\r\n\r\nJ.E.

To sit under the\r\nshadow of his own fig-tree, and drink of the fruit of his own vine, is\r\nthe reward promised, in Holy Writ, to the righteous man; and the\r\ngratification arising from the site of a favoured and long-remembered\r\ntree is one enjoyed in common by the peer, whom it reminds, as its\r\nbranches wave over his head whilst wandering in his hereditary domains,\r\nof the illustrious ancestors who may have seen it planted; and by the\r\npeasant, who recalls, as he looks on it in his way to his daily labours,\r\nthe sports of his infancy round its venerable trunk, and regards it at\r\nonce as his chronicler and landmark.\r\n\r\nWho indeed amongst us, in whatever position of life he may be, or in\r\nwhat land soever his lot may be cast, does not often find his mind’s eye\r\nresting upon some favourite tree; it may be some huge elm on his village\r\ngreen, where, in the dim twilight, he either told or listened to the\r\nfairy tale or exciting ghost story; or the spreading oak, beneath whose\r\nshade he has picnicked; or the haunted grove, where his tale, though\r\nonly whispered, yet spoke loudly to a willing listener.\r\n\r\n    Now shift the scene to moonlight glade,\r\n    Where dapper elves beneath the shade\r\n    Of oak or elm their revels keep,\r\n    What time we plodding mortals sleep.\r\n    Next lead me to some haunted grove,\r\n    Such as the Fauns and Dryads love;\r\n    Or seat me by some brook, whose swell\r\n    Makes music like a Naiad’s shell;\r\n    Then touch the tree ’neath which I lie,\r\n    Till it unclose to ear and eye\r\n    Whate’er it may have heard or seen\r\n    Since spring first clothed its stems with green.\r\n\r\n_Spirit of the Woods._\r\n\r\nBut we must not be led astray by the poetical emotions which are sure to\r\nrise up within us at the contemplation of forest trees; we shall\r\ntherefore confine ourself, in this treatise, more particularly to a\r\ngeneral description of the genera and species of trees usually grown in\r\nGreat Britain for timber, with an explanation of some of the principles\r\nconnected with the growth of timber.\r\n\r\nTimber in a country where trees are almost, if not wholly, planted,\r\naffords a subject for consideration very different from that of wild\r\naboriginal forests; in the former we have to consider our subjects as\r\nobjects for cultivation, and that with a view of yielding profit or\r\npleasure, or both, whilst the study of trees in the forest would\r\nnaturally resolve itself into a botanical and physiological inquiry into\r\nspecific forms. While, therefore, we would not here neglect the latter,\r\nour arrangement of trees and their history will have more particular\r\nreference to their cultivation, a subject which will probably address\r\nitself more especially to the landlord than to the tenant farmer.\r\n\r\nIn the main, then, the primary object of growing trees is that of\r\nprofit, whilst a secondary—or with some even primary—consideration will\r\nbe that of ornamentation; and we admit that, apart from any other\r\nconsideration, a landed estate without timber would be as bare, cold,\r\nand comfortless as a house without furniture; at the same time, too many\r\ntrees, and these in themselves awkwardly grown and stuck about in all\r\nsorts of awkward positions, would be like an over-furnished and\r\nill-regulated mansion.\r\n\r\nWe would, then, have that kind of thought exercised in planting which\r\nshould result, if not in profit, at least in providing ornament without\r\nloss, either to the tenant on the one hand, or the proprietor on the\r\nother. To this end we would advocate setting apart portions of the\r\nestate for the cultivation of timber in belt plantations, or even in\r\nwoods, having reference to the nature of the soil and general position,\r\nand this in preference to hedge-row planting, as long lines of ash or\r\nelm can never look ornamental however well-grown; but, inasmuch as this\r\nmode of growth necessitates lopping, the timber is so long in growing\r\nand then is never good, that it seldom pays even the expenses attendant\r\nupon its utilization.\r\n\r\nIn plantations, again, you can adopt such a system of growing nurses\r\nthat some return for the outlay will not be many years in commencing,\r\nand so profit by way of rent is not delayed as in hedge-row growth.[27]\r\n\r\n[27] We are aware that the landlord too often considers hedge-row timber\r\nas costless; but the injury which it entails upon the farm, and its\r\nnearly useless character, leads us to view the matter in a different\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand what we would call a forest nurse, let us suppose\r\nthat in a certain position our object is to grow a plantation of oak: we\r\nmight in this case mix beech, elm, larch, Scotch firs, and spruce with\r\nthe oak; these, by growing together, would increase an upward\r\ndevelopment; they would “pull each other up,” as usually expressed. Soon\r\nthis lateral growth would cause them to approach each other too closely,\r\nand then the larch would be first cut out, perhaps for hop-poles; next\r\nthe spruce and Scotch firs for fencing and other purposes; then the\r\nbeech and elm as they became useful; and at last, all the nurses gone,\r\nthe oak would be sufficient to occupy the space, and, though many years\r\nhave passed in the process, the wood has all the time yielded something\r\ntowards rent and expenses.\r\n\r\nIn planting, of course, the kinds to be planted will depend upon\r\ncircumstances, and so to a great extent will the methods to be adopted\r\nin planting; it may, however, be here stated that three plans of\r\npreparing the soil have been recommended:—1. _Trenching_; 2. _Pitting_;\r\nand 3. _Ploughing_.\r\n\r\n1. _Trenching_ is a very expensive process, and, upon the whole, is\r\nscarcely worth the cost. It is true that digging and turning over the\r\nsoil will cause a number of weeds to die, but, on the other hand, it\r\nencourages the growth of greater numbers than it destroys, and it is\r\ndoubtful whether weeding can be done so well in the loosened ground as\r\nit could before. Supposing, then, the young trees to be planted in old\r\nturf, we consider trenching to be quite unnecessary; but, as the plants\r\nwill flourish best when weeds and grass are kept under, we should advise\r\nthe skinning of the turf round them annually for about three years with\r\na common mattock, and at the same time advantage to be taken of the\r\nopportunity to tread in the trees more firmly when they may have become\r\nloosened; to remove any broken or decayed matter, as in the case of\r\nconifers, to see to the training of a single leader, rather than two or\r\nmore; and in all cases where young conifers show an increasing\r\ndisposition to grow a great quantity of fruits (cones), we should\r\neither dig around it, and, perhaps, apply a portion of manure, or\r\nsacrifice the plant and put a fresh one in its stead.\r\n\r\nThis premature fruiting arises sometimes from the roots of the plant\r\nhaving been too much crippled, either by breaking or drying from being\r\nkept too long out of the ground; we may here state, then, that, if only\r\nto prevent this, in all cases of transplantation, they should be taken\r\nout of the nursery with great care, so as to injure the roots as little\r\nas possible, and further be planted in their new home with the utmost\r\ndespatch. Disappointment is sure to result where trees of any kind have\r\nbeen kept long out of the ground, as they are when bought at market or\r\nin packets at sales. We should never purchase at the latter, unless they\r\nwere left in the ground to be fetched as might be required.\r\n\r\nAs we have been led incidentally to remark upon the subject of crippling\r\nby means of injured roots, we may now point out that the same thing\r\noccurs where young trees have been topped either for mischief, or\r\ninjudiciously pruned. We remember having some larches thus damaged by\r\nsome vagabond boy, and in seven years they were only dwarf cone-bearing\r\nbushes, whilst others planted at the same time were 15 feet in height.\r\nIn this case, then, instant removal, when discovered, and the being\r\nreplaced by fresh plants, would after all be a saving of time in getting\r\nuseful sticks.\r\n\r\n2. _Pitting._—In this process the soil is sometimes dug out so as to\r\nmake holes about 2 feet square, the soil being left to weather by the\r\nsides of the holes, and returned around the trees when they are\r\nplanted. This is not nearly so expensive as trenching; but it, too, is\r\nnot always advisable, for trees have the tendency to confine their roots\r\nto the dug-out space for some years, and so they do not get the hold\r\nupon the ground that they otherwise would.\r\n\r\nThis plan is that of partial trenching, and we should prefer the former\r\nto the pitting process, unless where stones, such as those found in the\r\noolite rocks, come to the surface. In such case, the removal of some of\r\nthe larger stones and supplementing them with soil from some other\r\nsource we have found to be of advantage.\r\n\r\n3. _Ploughing_ the soil is as expeditious a plan of preparing and\r\nclearing it as we possess; and now that steam cultivation can be brought\r\ninto action for a much greater depth than could be done with horses,\r\nsmashing-up the land by its means would be no bad preparation for\r\nplanting where this is to be done on tolerably level ground.\r\n\r\nWhile upon this subject we may here quote, as still worthy of attention,\r\nthe directions in the fourth edition of the “Sylva.”\r\n\r\n     Let us now see in what manner we are to prepare the ground for\r\n     their reception. The best way is by trenching, or double digging,\r\n     as deep as the soil will admit of; but as this is a very expensive\r\n     proceeding, and consequently can only be practised upon a small\r\n     scale, I shall recommend another good method of preparing the\r\n     ground. This is to be done by proper ploughing, and, if agreeable,\r\n     the year before the land is planted, it may bear a crop of oats,\r\n     rape, or turnips. By this means the sward will be effectually\r\n     destroyed. After the crop is off, let the ground be\r\n     trench-ploughed, and then harrowed with very heavy harrows, to\r\n     break the clods; about the end of October let it be again ploughed\r\n     crossways, and harrowed as before. This is the season for planting\r\n     the sets, for the ground, by being thus cross-ploughed and well\r\n     harrowed, will be in proper order for their reception. The manner\r\n     of planting the sets is as follows:—\r\n\r\n     First, carefully take the plants out of the seed-beds, shorten the\r\n     tap-root, and take off part of the side-shoots, that there may be\r\n     an equal proportion of strength between the stem and the root. If\r\n     the wood is designed to be but small, ten, twenty, or thirty acres,\r\n     then lines may be drawn, and the trees planted in rows, four feet\r\n     distant from each other, and the trees two feet asunder in the row:\r\n     each line must have a man and a boy for planting. The ground being\r\n     made light and pliable by cross-ploughing and harrowing, the man\r\n     strikes his spade into the earth close to the line; he then takes\r\n     it out, and gives another stroke at right angles with it; then the\r\n     boy, having a parcel of plants under his left arm, takes one with\r\n     his right hand, and readily puts it into the crevice made by the\r\n     spade at the second stroke; after this the man gently presses the\r\n     mould to it with his foot, and thus the young oakling is planted.\r\n     He proceeds in the same manner to the next, and so on till all is\r\n     finished. An active man with his boy will plant 1,500 or 2,000 in a\r\n     day; and while they are planting others should be employed in\r\n     taking up fresh sets from the seed-bed, sorting them, and preparing\r\n     their roots. In short, a sufficient number of hands should be set\r\n     to every part of this work, that the whole may be carried on with\r\n     despatch and regularity; for the ground cannot be too soon\r\n     furnished with its plants after it is in readiness to receive them,\r\n     neither can the plants be put too early into the ground after they\r\n     are taken up from the seminary. Those plants which are nearly of\r\n     the same size should be made to occupy a large quarter together,\r\n     and the weakest should be left in the seminary a year longer to\r\n     gain strength.\r\n\r\n     The trees, either for small or large plantations, being in the\r\n     ground, the first care should be to fence them well from cattle,\r\n     and even, if possible, from rabbits and hares. The next should be\r\n     to keep them clear from weeds, that they may not be incommoded in\r\n     their growth. In all lands weeds must be carefully watched and\r\n     destroyed at their first appearance. In small plantations hoeing\r\n     may do; but where the plantations are large and noble, a\r\n     double-shelving plough should be provided; and when the weeds are\r\n     got two or three inches high, this must be drawn exactly down the\r\n     middle of each row by horses with their mouths muzzled, somebody\r\n     leading the foremost horse; this plough will effectually throw a\r\n     ridge each way, so that the edge of it will be almost contiguous\r\n     to the plants on both sides. This being done, the whole surface of\r\n     the ground will be changed, and the weeds all buried, except a few\r\n     about the stems of the plants, which a man following the plough\r\n     should cut or pluck up. In this manner the ground may lie until a\r\n     fresh crop of weeds present themselves; when these are about three\r\n     inches high, a common plough should be provided to go up one side\r\n     of the row and down the other, to plough the ridges made by the\r\n     double-shelving plough into their former places, men following with\r\n     hoes to destroy such weeds as are near the stems of the trees. Thus\r\n     will the whole scene be changed again; the ground will appear as\r\n     new-tilled; and in this condition it may remain until the weeds\r\n     call for the double-shelving plough a second time, which must also\r\n     be followed alternately with the common plough as occasion may\r\n     require. By this means the ground will not only be kept clear of\r\n     weeds, but the earth, by constant stirring, will be more replete\r\n     with nourishing juices, the gentle showers will produce their good\r\n     effects, the sun will have his influence, and all the powers of\r\n     vegetation will combine to nourish and set forward the infant oak.\r\n     This work must be repeated every year, until the oaks are of a\r\n     height sufficient to destroy the weeds, which may be, perhaps, in\r\n     three or four years, according to the goodness of the ground in\r\n     which they are planted.\r\n\r\nStill, notwithstanding the care sometimes taken in planting, we have\r\noften observed that the simple method of making triangular or cruciform\r\nopenings with the spade, thus—[Y] [+], and carefully dividing the roots\r\nin putting the plants in their places, and afterwards well pressing the\r\nturf against them, has succeeded as well as any other method. Indeed, we\r\nhave known plants put in with only a single slit; but this never\r\nsucceeds so well, though it is more expeditiously performed. Where,\r\nhowever, trees are put in at so much an acre, the plan of action must be\r\nspecified, and the proceedings carefully watched, to ensure its due\r\nperformance, or the work will most likely be done in the quickest, and\r\nnot best, manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nON THE KINDS OF TIMBER BEST ADAPTED FOR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the growth and quality of timber will be influenced by the nature\r\nof the soil is a matter so well understood that it would scarcely\r\nrequire to be treated of in this place, if we did not daily see examples\r\nof planting in which all laws of growth have been set at defiance;\r\nstill, occasionally, experience has lent her aid and produced some\r\nsatisfactory results; and, as an exemplification of our meaning, and as\r\nshowing the influence of geological position upon planting, we would\r\ndirect attention to the following section:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALICE HOLT FOREST.\r\n\r\nBeech. Hops. Larch. Oak. Larch. Hops. Beech.\r\n\r\n4. Chalk. 3. Chalk Marl. 2. Upper G. S. 1. Gault Clay.]\r\n\r\nHere we have the oak—of both varieties known to planters, to be\r\nhereafter described—flourishing most luxuriantly on the stiff soil of\r\nthe gault; the chalk-marl, upper green sand, and gault—the two latter\r\nonly partially—being engaged in hop cultivation. The green sand\r\nsurrounding the forest is mostly devoted to the growth of larch or\r\nspruce, the thinnings of which are used for hop-poles and the larger\r\ntrees are left as timber-belts; whilst the beech will be found to favour\r\nthe chalk. Hops and other cultivated plants flourish according to\r\ngeological position.\r\n\r\nThat the geology of a district affects vegetation mainly, according to\r\nthe mechanical and chemical structure of its individual rocks and the\r\nclimate in which they are situate, is quite true; and yet the following\r\ntable will show that different formations favour the growth of trees\r\nupon other conditions than those named.\r\n\r\nChoosing figures to represent relative values, the annexed table is\r\nintended to show the amount of influence exercised by certain geological\r\nrocks in the growth of different fruit and forest trees met with in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n  +-----------+---+------------------+------+-----+----+----+------+-----+\r\n  |           |No.|Rocks.            |Apple.|Pear.|Oak.|Elm.|Beech.|Firs.|\r\n  +-----------+---+------------------+------+-----+----+----+------+-----+\r\n  |Cretaceous{| 1 |Chalk             |   2  |  0  |  2 |  4 |   8  |  5  |\r\n  |Rocks.    {| 2 |Green Sands       |   3  |  1  |  3 |  7 |   0  |  3  |\r\n  |          {| 3 |Gault             |   4  |  1  |  6 |  6 |   0  |  0  |\r\n  |Jurassique}| 4 |Oxford Clay       |   6  |  0  | 10 |  8 |   0  |  1  |\r\n  |Rocks.    }| 5 |Oolite Freestone  |   2  |  0  |  1 |  4 |  10  |  5  |\r\n  |          }| 6 |Lias              |  10  |  3  |  5 | 10 |   0  |  1  |\r\n  |           | 7 |New Red Sandstone |   8  | 10  |  7 | 12 |   0  |  2  |\r\n  |           | 8 |Mountain Limestone|   1  |  0  |  2 |  2 |   3  |  1  |\r\n  |           | 9 |Old Red Sandstone |  15  |  8  |  8 | 10 |   0  |  1  |\r\n  +-----------+---+------------------+------+-----+----+----+------+-----+\r\n\r\nThese figures may serve to express—although roughly—the capacities of\r\ndifferent formations for the production of fruit and forest trees, and\r\nit may be curious to note that, while the chalk and the oolite\r\nfreestones, both composed of carbonate of lime, offer a remarkable\r\nagreement in point of dendrological productions, the mountain limestone,\r\nalso consisting of carbonate of lime, affords very different results;\r\nhere, no doubt, the different kinds of scenery presented by the rocks\r\nthemselves have a decided influence on the general results.\r\n\r\nMuch, however, of any geological influence in the growth of trees must\r\ndepend upon the material rather than upon the position of the rocks\r\nforming the subsoil upon which they occur, and thus it may be expected\r\nthat clays, limestones, and sands, and different mixtures of these, will\r\neach favour the growth of a peculiar spontaneous or native vegetation;\r\nso that, if we looked to a larger list of trees and coupled it with\r\nlists of herbaceous plants, we might make out even a stronger case,\r\neither for the effects of geological or lithological conditions; but\r\nenough has been said to point out that various trees naturally affect\r\none position more than another, and so they succeed as the results of\r\nplanting and cultivation in one kind of soil in preference to another,\r\nand it may be laid down as a rule, that pomaceous fruits and hard-wooded\r\ntrees, as oak and elm, only _flourish_ in strong soils, though they may\r\nbe imperfectly grown in all soils, whilst soft-wooded trees, as beech,\r\nlime, and the coniferæ, succeed best in lighter soils; hence, then, the\r\nplanter who would try to grow vigorous oak on sandbeds would be\r\ndisappointed, and while beech is the “weed” of the Cotteswold oolite,\r\nwhoever tries to grow an orchard upon the freestone rocks is sure to\r\nmeet with disappointment.\r\n\r\nAs regards forest trees we shall, for the most part, confine our remarks\r\nto those of the following list, as, although of recent years many new\r\ngenera and species have been introduced, they are not yet in general\r\ncultivation even for ornamental purposes, much less as a source of\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n  LIST OF NATIVE OR NATURALIZED FOREST TREES.\r\n\r\n  Oak          }\r\n  Chestnut     } Our more common timber trees used\r\n  Walnut       } in buildings, furniture, cooperage,\r\n  Elm          } turnery, &c.\r\n  Ash          }\r\n  Beech        }\r\n\r\n  Birch        } Employed in furniture, turnery, &c.\r\n  Larch        } The British Coniferæ are not used\r\n  Spruce       } for timber, except for fencing and\r\n  Scotch Fir   } other common purposes.\r\n  Poplar       }\r\n\r\n  Plane        }\r\n  Mountain Ash } Employed for turnery, picture-frames,\r\n  Maple        } and occasional useful purposes.\r\n  Lime         }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nON THE BRITISH OAK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst the discussion is still pending, of iron against wooden bulwarks,\r\nif only for the love we feel towards the “brave old oak,” a few notes\r\nupon the forms of this truly national tree can hardly fail to be\r\nacceptable. At starting, however, we must bear in mind, that though we\r\nhave ever looked upon the oak as so thoroughly British that we had\r\nalmost been brought to think that it was made for the sole glory of our\r\nland, yet there are those who would wish to cast a doubt upon its true\r\naboriginal nature, and who, according to their custom, represent\r\neverything great as borrowed from the Continent. What says, however,\r\nthat pleasant discourser on forest trees, Jacob George Strutt, of\r\nimperishable sylvan fame:—“In proportion as the oak is valued above all\r\nother trees, so is the English oak esteemed above that of any other\r\ncountry, for its particular characteristics of hardness and toughness,\r\nqualities which so peculiarly fit it to be the ‘father of ships,’ and\r\nwhich are so admirably expressed in two epithets by that great poet, to\r\nwhom the book of nature and of the human heart seemed alike laid open:—\r\n\r\n    Thou rather with thy sharp and sulph’rous bolt\r\n    Splitt’st the _unwedgeable_ and _gnarled_ oak,\r\n    Than the soft myrtle.”—SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\nSelby again, in his “History of Forest Trees,” a work which should be\r\nin the hands of all lovers of the beautiful natural objects of which it\r\ntreats, describes the finding of some bog oaks, which would almost\r\nconnect the present race with a fossilized past:—\r\n\r\n     At the Linden, the seat of C. W. Bigge, Esq., the trunk of a\r\n     magnificent oak was extracted from a peat moss that fills a small\r\n     basin or hollow, evidently produced by the stagnation of a stream,\r\n     which now passes through it, and which, at some distant period, had\r\n     been dammed back by the fall of the trees upon its margins. This\r\n     oak was covered by a layer of the peat to the depth of about three\r\n     feet, and was discovered by probing the moss. The trunk, with a\r\n     small portion of one of the larger limbs, was with great labour and\r\n     difficulty dragged from its miry bed. The contents of the portion\r\n     recovered contained 545 cubic feet, although the whole of the\r\n     sap-wood had perished. The timber was perfectly sound, and the\r\n     tree, by whatever accident it had been overthrown, had fallen in\r\n     the vigour of its growth. When sawn up, the interior planks were\r\n     found of a deep rich brown colour; those nearer the exterior\r\n     darker, or approaching to black. A variety of elegant furniture has\r\n     been made from the wood; but it has been found necessary, for fine\r\n     cabinet-work, to have it cut into veneers, for, when worked in\r\n     bulk, it is apt to crack and become warped. Remains of other huge\r\n     oaks have also been met with on the banks of the Tyne, the Alne,\r\n     and other rivers, as well as in various bogs and morasses; and we\r\n     mention these instances to show that in a district where, at the\r\n     present day, nothing but recently-planted oak or dwarfish timber\r\n     from stock-shoots exists, in former times the monarch of the forest\r\n     grew luxuriantly, and attained a splendid development; and also as\r\n     an inducement to the planter not to neglect the liberal insertion\r\n     of this national tree wherever soil and situation are found\r\n     congenial to its growth. In other parts of England, the oak still\r\n     grows in all its native magnificence of form and dimensions, and\r\n     the remains of those ancient forests, which are chronicled by our\r\n     earliest writers, and which, in the time of our Saxon ancestors,\r\n     spread over the greater portion of the country, are still to be\r\n     traced in the venerable but living relics of enormous oaks, many of\r\n     which are supposed to number more than a thousand years.\r\n\r\nNot to neglect to plant the national tree! We hope indeed that there is\r\nno possessor of broad acres who does not esteem it a duty, regardless of\r\nprofit, to provide for a succession of forest kings, if only to beautify\r\nthe face of the country, and to leave the people of the present, some\r\ngrand living object to connect them with the history of the past. In\r\nfact, planting of the “British oak” has not only been considered a duty,\r\nbut followed out with the keenest pleasure by the country gentleman. In\r\nso doing, the question has scarcely until lately occurred, is the\r\nBritish oak always the same? or, are there not different species, or at\r\nleast varieties of the genus _quercus_ which have been confounded by the\r\nplanter? To this question we now propose to address our inquiries.\r\n\r\nOn referring to different authors, we shall find mention of the\r\nfollowing names as applied to the British oak:—\r\n\r\n  1. Quercus robur, _Linn_.\r\n\r\n  2.    „    sessiliflora, _Salisbury_.\r\n\r\n  3.    „    intermedia, _Don_.\r\n\r\nThis method of nomenclature would, however, be only tenable on the\r\nsupposition that we considered the trees so named _specifically_\r\ndistinct; but as we incline to believe them to be only varieties—though\r\nhighly important as such—we intend to treat of them as follows:—\r\n\r\n  1st. QUERCUS ROBUR PEDUNCULATA.\r\n\r\n  2nd.    „      „   SESSILIFLORA.\r\n\r\n  3rd.    „      „   INTERMEDIA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate II.\r\n\r\nJ. E. Sowerby, sc.\r\n\r\nW. West, imp.\r\n\r\nQuercus Robur Sessiliflora.]\r\n\r\n1st. _Quercus Robur pedunculata_ is readily distinguished in trees\r\nseparate from others by its robust habits, thick, gnarled, twisted, and\r\nmore or less horizontally inclined branches. The leaves have\r\ncomparatively few broad, wavy indentations, and are set on a short\r\nleaf-stalk (petiole) (Plate I. fig. _a_), the fruit being situate on\r\nlong footstalks (peduncles), varying from two to upwards of four inches\r\n(fig. _b_).\r\n\r\nThis is the typical British oak, the pride of our sailors, when men\r\nfought bravely and did not care to vie with each other as to who should\r\nmake the most secure skulking-places. The tree—\r\n\r\n                            Whose roots descend\r\n    As low towards Pluto’s realms, as high in air\r\n    Its massive branches rise.  The utmost rage\r\n    Of wintry storms howls o’er its strength in vain.\r\n    Successive generations of mankind,\r\n    Revolving ages flourish and decay,\r\n    Yet still immovable it stands, and throws\r\n    Its vigorous limbs around, and proudly bears\r\n    With firm and solid trunk its stately form,\r\n    A mighty canopy of thickest shade.\r\n\r\nVIRGIL, _Georg._ ii. 291.\r\n\r\nThis is the tree that seems to be longer lived than any other in\r\nBritain, and though it would appear to be the prey of nearly, if not\r\nquite, two hundred species of insects, it has still had vigour of\r\nconstitution to survive them all; and in many instances we might point\r\nto brave old trees which must have been veterans at the time of the\r\nNorman Conquest. Now, however, they are old and staggy, with hollow\r\ntrunks truly—but what trunks!—from forty to fifty feet in circumference,\r\npresenting the following picture to us as it did to Spenser:—\r\n\r\n    There grew an aged tree on the green,\r\n    A goodly oak some time had it been,\r\n    With arms full long, and largely displayed,\r\n    But of their leaves they were disarrayed;\r\n    The body big, and mightily pight,\r\n    Thoroughly rooted, and of wond’rous height:\r\n    Whilom had been the king of the field,\r\n    And mockel mast to the husband did yield;\r\n    And with his nuts larded many a swine,\r\n    But now the grey moss marred his rine;\r\n    His bared boughs were beaten with storms,\r\n    His top was bald and wasted with worms,\r\n    His honour decay’d, his branches sere.\r\n\r\n_Shepherd’s Calendar._\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, is a melancholy sight, like the Stag’s Horn Oak by the\r\nroadside between Farnham and Woolmer, in the ancient boundary of Alice\r\nHolt Forest; yet this has a young tree growing by its side, perhaps one\r\nof his own children, which gracefully conceals much of his gaunt\r\nnakedness. In the same forest are many old staggy trees, their contorted\r\nhorn-like branches sticking out in a most picturesque manner from the\r\ntop and sides of a still leafy head. In these the white owls may yet be\r\nseen peering out of dark cavernous hollows as they did in Gilbert\r\nWhite’s day; and during the summer of 1861 we with pleasure watched\r\ntheir motions, which so minutely agreed with those described by the\r\nfather of observing naturalists, that we cannot forbear quoting his\r\nremarks thereon in his “Natural History of Selborne,” a not very distant\r\nparish from the Holt, and to which he indeed often refers:—\r\n\r\n     As I have paid particular attention to the manner of life of these\r\n     birds (the White Owl), during their season of breeding, which lasts\r\n     the summer through, the following remarks may not be unacceptable.\r\n     About an hour before sunset (for then the mice begin to run), they\r\n     sally forth in quest of prey, and hunt all round the hedges of\r\n     meadows and small enclosures for them, which seem to be their only\r\n     food. In this irregular country we can stand on an eminence and see\r\n     them beat the fields over like a setting-dog, and often drop down\r\n     in the grass or corn. I have minuted these birds with my watch for\r\n     an hour together, and have found that they return to their nest,\r\n     the one or the other of them, about once in five minutes;\r\n     reflecting at the same time on the adroitness that every animal is\r\n     possessed of as far as regards the well-being of itself and\r\n     offspring.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the good done by these birds in keeping under mice, all\r\nour eloquence could scarcely preserve them from the onslaught of the\r\nkeeper; they were, however, protected during our pleasant sojourn at the\r\nHolt; but we much fear only, after all, to gratify the taste for stuffed\r\nbirds, a _love_ which is equally fatal to the feathered race (and\r\nespecially the finest examples thereof) as the _hate_ of the keeper.\r\n\r\nBut we are digressing sadly, and must return to _Quercus Robur\r\npedunculata_, and complete our observations thereon with the statement\r\nthat most, if not all, the nobler examples of oaks in England belong to\r\nthis form. Selby directs attention to the “Flitton Oak, in Devonshire,\r\nof the _Sessiliflora_ variety, supposed to be one thousand years old,\r\nand which is thirty-three feet in circumference at one foot from the\r\nground.” However, nearly every historical oak is of the pedunculate\r\nvariety. In the Holt forest are still left some huge examples; the same\r\nin the Dean forest; and Braydon, near Swindon, Wilts, though\r\ndisafforested, can yet show noble trees of this form. Indeed, throughout\r\nEngland it is difficult to meet with many examples of any other form,\r\nexcept in Wyre forest, Worcestershire, where the tree next to be\r\ndescribed is perhaps the more general, and it would also appear that in\r\nthe New Forest the _Q. sessiliflora_ is also frequently met with.\r\n\r\n_Quercus Robur sessiliflora_ may be generally described as of a more\r\nupright and formal habit. Limbs straighter and less gnarled. Bark\r\nusually smoother than the former. The leaf has many sinuosities, and is\r\nset on a comparatively long leaf-stalk (petiole) (Plate II. fig. _a_).\r\n\r\nThe fruit, on the contrary, is so nearly sessile that it may be said to\r\nhave little more than the indication of a peduncle (fig. _b_).\r\n\r\nWe have already stated our opinion that the sessile-fruited oak does not\r\nusually attain the huge dimensions of the pedunculate form; but on the\r\nother hand we incline to the belief that it grows more rapidly, and is\r\nbest adapted for a lighter soil than the latter. There are conditions\r\nwhich might to a greater or less extent affect the quality of its\r\ntimber, but we do not think that there is much difference in this\r\nrespect. We believe that their wood has been used indifferently, and the\r\nquality is influenced by surrounding circumstances. Selby, in his\r\n“History of Forest Trees,” states on this head:—“The result, perhaps, of\r\nsome original constitutional defect, or arising from the nature of the\r\nsoil, situation, or other local peculiarities of the ground upon which\r\nthe timber has been raised; such at least is the result of our own\r\nexperience, as we have met with oak of the _peduncled_ kind, its timber\r\npossessing all the inferior qualities attributed to, and supposed to be\r\npossessed exclusively by, _Q. sessiliflora_.” The longer, straighter\r\nspars of the Sessiliflora, in days when oak was so uniformly used for\r\nroofs, seem to have pointed out this variety for roof-timbering; and\r\nhence some of the finest ancient timbered roofs of this country have\r\nbeen ascertained to have been formed from its wood. With respect to\r\nthese the opinion long prevailed that they were formed of the wood of\r\nthe Spanish chestnut. This, however, is but a poor timber tree, as, long\r\nbefore it could afford so large a scantling as would be required by the\r\nroof of the Parliament House at Edinburgh or of Westminster Abbey (both\r\nof which were supposed to be of chestnut), the chestnut would begin to\r\ndecay at the heart; in fact, just at the period when the heart-wood of\r\noak begins to harden, that of the chestnut would appear to deteriorate.\r\n\r\n_Quercus Robur intermedia_, having a petiole intermediate in length\r\nbetween the other two varieties described, and a peduncle varying from a\r\nquarter to one inch in length, may with propriety be deemed a variety\r\nintermediate between “Sessiliflora” and “Pedunculata,” and a comparison\r\nof the three will substantiate its claim to this title.\r\n\r\nAs a tree it is impossible to make out any specific character from its\r\nmode of growth, and, indeed, without the fruit, it is extremely\r\ndifficult even to distinguish it as a variety.\r\n\r\nIt occurs—only occasionally—in the Cotteswold district, and we suppose\r\nthe same elsewhere. One meets with it here and there in the hedge-rows,\r\nand in Oakley Park, the seat of Earl Bathurst, we can point out a few\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Galls of the _Cynips Quercus petiolata_.\r\n\r\n(Natural size.)]\r\n\r\nPassing from the subject of the varieties of our British oak, it now\r\nremains to mention a most formidable enemy by which it has of late years\r\nbeen attacked, and so exclusively, that in plantations where may be\r\nfound the American oaks, the Ilex oak, and Turkey oak trees, it has been\r\nthe only one subjected to the operations of the new gall pest. It has\r\nlong been known that our native oaks were subject to excrescences of\r\ndifferent forms and sizes, such, for example, as oak-apples, oakleaf\r\ngalls, oak spangles, &c., all of which were ascertained to be caused by\r\nseveral species of _cynips_; but lately we have to lament the\r\nintroduction of a new species of the same insect, forming a new kind of\r\ngall, which, instead of attacking the backs of the leaves, as does the\r\noakleaf gall, occupies the stem that belongs to the leaf; in fact, the\r\nattacked leaves seem to be converted into bunches of galls, as\r\nrepresented in the adjoining figure, which presents an illustration of\r\nthe new pest. They are hard galls, more or less like the “nut-gall” from\r\nAleppo, of which ink is made, and it will be seen that the little twig\r\nsupports no less than five galls, in the interior of each of which may\r\nbe found the maggot or _larva_ of an insect; and, as this is affected at\r\nthe expense of the buds and leaves, the mode of injury must be obvious,\r\nas the new twigs which would have been formed, had there been no galls,\r\nwould in their turn have produced branches and leaves. Trees thus\r\ninfested are crippled as though they had been subjected to constant\r\npruning.\r\n\r\nAs much of the natural history of the _cynips_, by which these gall-nuts\r\nare formed, as is necessary for our purpose, may be gathered from a\r\npaper by Mr. Parfitt, who seems to have well studied the gall insect in\r\nDevon, its head-quarters. We quote it from the Journal of the Bath and\r\nWest of England Agricultural Society for 1861:—\r\n\r\n     The eggs deposited by the females in the oak buds in September\r\n     remain there in a state of apparent quiescence till the following\r\n     spring; then, as soon as the sap begins to flow, the irritant\r\n     injected into the wound at the same time the _egg_ was deposited,\r\n     or possibly the combined action of the egg and irritant, causes the\r\n     sap to diverge; that portion of the bud which should have formed a\r\n     young shoot is converted into a spherical ball; the outer scales of\r\n     the bud fall away, and it is the woody secretion which entirely\r\n     forms the gall. The cells in the gall are not elongated and\r\n     regular, as in the young shoot, but confused and irregular; and in\r\n     the centre of each gall lies a young grub of the _cynips_, forming\r\n     a living nucleus, around which is deposited a thin, hard, woody\r\n     envelope, much more compact in substance than the sponge-like\r\n     tissue which fills up the interstice between it and the shining\r\n     outer coat of the gall. This compactness of structure is a\r\n     necessary and all-wise provision of nature for protecting the\r\n     delicate insect which lies within from destruction; for if the gall\r\n     were composed entirely of large spongy cells, the rapid flow of sap\r\n     in the early spring would be more than the creature could consume,\r\n     and it would consequently be drowned. I am aware that some\r\n     naturalists incline to the opinion that the _larvæ_ of the _cynips_\r\n     feed on the gall. From this view, however, I venture to dissent;\r\n     for not only is it inconsistent with the structure of the\r\n     creature’s mouth, and the position in which the young _larvæ_ are\r\n     invariably found, with the head tucked under the apex of the\r\n     abdomen, but if they fed on the substance or crude material of the\r\n     gall, the undigested parts would certainly be found in the\r\n     interior of its cell: in other words, the excrement would be there,\r\n     for there is no outlet, and the lacteals or absorbent vessels of\r\n     the gall could not take it up. I therefore think that the creature\r\n     feeds entirely on the sap of the tree—an elaborate food fit for it\r\n     without the need of mastication. This explains how it happens that\r\n     the galls of commerce, with the insects in them, are so much better\r\n     and dearer than those from which the _cynips_ has escaped; in a\r\n     word, the tannic acid is more abundant.\r\n\r\n     It has been before observed, that there are two broods of the\r\n     insect in a season; thus, those which do not emerge from the gall\r\n     in September remain on till the following April or May. This is a\r\n     wise provision of nature for continuing the species, should\r\n     anything befall the autumn brood; and it is the more deserving of\r\n     notice, because the gall-producing _cynips_ has a deadly enemy\r\n     which accompanies or follows it in its flight from bud to bud, and\r\n     deposits an egg wherever it finds the egg of the _cynips_. Here, as\r\n     soon as the _cynips_ larva is hatched, the larva of the parasite is\r\n     hatched also; forthwith the latter proceeds to eat a hole in the\r\n     skin of the rightful occupant of the nidus, and the two larvæ go on\r\n     growing together till the _cynips_ is ready to assume the pupal\r\n     state; then the parasite cuts the vital thread of the _cynips_, and\r\n     uses its skin for a pupal envelope for itself; and thus, instead of\r\n     the gall-fly emerging into day, a beautiful green insect makes its\r\n     appearance on the stage of life. I had the pleasure of first\r\n     discovering this parasite while engaged in studying the _cynips_;\r\n     it belongs to the genus _Callimone_, and from the fact of having\r\n     discovered it in Devonshire, I gave it the name of _Callimone\r\n     Devoniensis_. It is one of the handsomest of our British insects;\r\n     its costume a brilliant green, shot with gold; the abdominal\r\n     segments green, gold, and purple; legs yellow; tarsi reddish; and\r\n     it has four beautiful transparent and iridescent wings.\r\n\r\n     It has been stated that oak-galls are produced at the expense of\r\n     acorns. From this view my experience leads me to dissent. In\r\n     exceptional instances it may have been the case; but as a rule the\r\n     _cynips_ confines its attacks to young trees and young growths in\r\n     hedges, within a range of ten or twelve feet from the ground, and\r\n     the nearer the ground the more numerous the galls. Young trees\r\n     which have not attained a greater height than that I have indicated\r\n     suffer so much that many of them can scarcely make headway against\r\n     their foe; and in several nurseries I have visited, where it might\r\n     be expected that greater care would be paid than in the case of\r\n     ordinary plantations, the young stock of oaks has been rendered\r\n     quite unsaleable by the pest. This year I have noticed the progress\r\n     of the insect on two groups of young English and Turkey oaks\r\n     growing side by side; and although there are hundreds of galls on\r\n     the English oaks, there are none on the Turkey oaks. From this I am\r\n     led to infer that the species of _cynips_ now under notice is\r\n     confined in its depredations to the English oak; and as it\r\n     invariably selects trees of younger or restricted growth—probably\r\n     because the temperature at a higher elevation than ten or twelve\r\n     feet from the earth is unfavourable to it—it would seem that\r\n     children might be advantageously employed in young plantations in\r\n     collecting the galls by means of cutting-hooks, such as are used\r\n     for thistles. The galls, when once collected, might either be\r\n     crushed for tanning purposes, or consumed by fire, and if the\r\n     process were repeated for two or three seasons, it is more than\r\n     probable that the plantation would be altogether free from the\r\n     pest.\r\n\r\nThese able remarks not only well describe the nature of the attack, but\r\nalso point to a cure—a matter to which we would direct the most serious\r\nattention of the planter; for we may state that, in 1853, we saw some\r\nvery small oak trees, in the neighbourhood of Dawlish, Devon, from which\r\nsome hundreds of these galls might have been gathered. This was the\r\nfirst time we had noticed this pest, though it appears that it had been\r\nunder Mr. Parfitt’s notice as long as a dozen years. Since then (1853)\r\nwe have traced it in its progress as follows:—\r\n\r\nHaving observed the galls in Devon in 1853, we were yearly on the\r\nlook-out in the Midland and Eastern counties for its appearance, and the\r\nfollowing dates will show that its spread, though gradual, was\r\nsufficiently rapid:—\r\n\r\n  The galls were gathered in Devon in                   1853\r\n  The same kind in Somerset, in                         1854\r\n  In Gloucester, on the west side of the river Severn,\r\n  Forest of Dean, in                                    1855\r\n  In Gloucester, east side of the Severn, and as far as\r\n  Oakley Park, Cirencester, in                          1856\r\n  In Worcestershire, in                                 1857\r\n  In North Wales, Beddgelert (pointed out to us by\r\n  John Savory, Esq.), in                                1859\r\n  In Sussex, very sparingly, in                         1860\r\n  In Alice Holt Forest, and far from abundant, in       1861\r\n  About Hastings, very plentifully, in                  1862\r\n\r\nWe have this season observed a lot of the young galls; but last year,\r\nfor the first time, we discovered that, in many cases, the maggot had\r\nbeen extracted by some small bird, one of the titmice (_Parus\r\ncæruleus_); and, if so, wherever young oaks may be growing, it should\r\nafford an additional reason for the protection of these useful birds.\r\nThe magnitude of the evil, unless checked by some means, may be\r\nestimated from the fact that, in 1856, we could scarcely find half a\r\ndozen galls within a wide district, and now all around may be found\r\ntrees, not more than 10 feet high, upon which are no less than from one\r\nto five hundred distinct galls.\r\n\r\nWe conclude these remarks upon our native oaks with the fervent hope\r\nthat in “Merry England” it may ever be as described by dear old\r\nChaucer:—\r\n\r\n                                A pleasant grove\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    In which were okes grete, streight as a line,\r\n    Undir the which the grass so fresh of hew\r\n    Was newly sprong, and an eight fote, or nine,\r\n    Every tree well from his fellow grew,\r\n    With branches brode, laden with levis new,\r\n    That, sprongin out agen, the sonnè shene.\r\n    Some very rede; and some a glad light grene.\r\n\r\n_The Floure and the Leafe._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nON THE CHESTNUT AND WALNUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chestnut and Walnut are here brought together, not only as producing\r\ntwo useful kinds of hard-wooded timber, but from the fact of both being\r\nbearers of esteemed kinds of fruit. They are neither grown to the same\r\nextent in England as on the Continent, and probably neither of them is\r\nindigenous to this country, although it is stated by Sir W. Hooker to\r\ngrow in woods apparently wild, in the south and south-west of England.\r\nAs regards the fruit of the former, it may be said that in parts of\r\nSpain “Spanish Chestnuts” are a staple article of food. In England they\r\nare sometimes brought to table as a stuffing for turkeys, or roasted for\r\ndessert; but their greatest consumption among us is with the poor, who,\r\nin winter, with a halfpenny-worth of roasted chestnuts enjoy the double\r\nluxury of warm fingers and a sweet nutritious diet. Walnuts, as a fruit,\r\nare highly esteemed by all classes: as much by those who crack and peel\r\nthem in a second or third class railway carriage, as by the squire who\r\ntakes them as a concomitant with his glass of port. With us they are\r\nonly cared for while they can be peeled, but abroad they are carefully\r\ndried, in which state they form an important article of commerce. In the\r\nPortuguese court of the International Exhibition of 1861, in our\r\ncapacity of juryman, we had brought before us specimens of dried walnuts\r\nfrom as many as fifty exhibitors.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish chestnut (_Castanea vulgaris_) has no relationship with the\r\nso-called horse-chestnut, which latter, we might just mention, is solely\r\nemployed as an ornamental tree, if we except its occasional use in\r\ncabinet-work. Evelyn, sixty years ago, speaks of it as being “all the\r\nmode for the avenues to their country palaces in France.” It has been\r\nmuch used for this purpose with us, and its magnificent flowers and fine\r\nfoliage will ever recommend it as an ornament about country residences.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Spanish chestnut. This tree is planted with us both\r\nfor the growth of timber or as underwood for poles; for the latter\r\npurpose it answers well, as it soon grows up again after cutting, and in\r\nits young state it goes so soon to heart-wood that the poles are\r\nremarkably strong and tough.\r\n\r\nAs a timber tree, the chestnut has been very extensively extolled both\r\nin this country and on the Continent; it may, however, be concluded that\r\nalthough its wood is exceedingly useful, it has never been put to the\r\nimportant uses which have been claimed for it.\r\n\r\nEvelyn, speaking of chestnut-wood, says:—“I had once a very large barn\r\nnear the city, framed entirely of this timber.”\r\n\r\nSir T. D. Lauder tells us that the roof of the Parliament House in\r\nEdinburgh is constructed of chestnut, and we have often seen it stated\r\nthat the magnificent roof of Westminster Hall has been framed of this\r\ntimber;[28] but to quote from Selby’s admirable “History of British\r\nForest Trees”:—\r\n\r\n     The fact is, as Buffon first observed, the wood of the oak, more\r\n     particularly that of the sessile-fruited variety, assumes, in\r\n     course of time, a near resemblance in colour to that of the\r\n     chestnut in its best condition, or when young and untainted at\r\n     heart; and as few chestnuts could have acquired the scantling\r\n     frequently observed in the timbers of these ancient buildings at\r\n     the age dialling or decay almost invariably commences, this in\r\n     itself furnishes a strong argument against the use of chestnut\r\n     timbers and beams by our ancestors, inasmuch as the trees must\r\n     become unfit for the purpose long before they had attained the\r\n     necessary dimensions.—P. 326.\r\n\r\n[28] Many of the most ancient houses in London were built of its\r\n(chestnut) wood, as is the roof of Westminster Hall, built by William\r\nRufus, in the year 1099, still free from any appearance of decay.—_Sylva\r\nBritannica_, p. 81.\r\n\r\nBut although we may safely dismiss the notion that chestnut is of the\r\nvalue formerly supposed, yet its timber is not without its uses; it is\r\nemployed for smaller beams, gate-posts, piles, and other purposes where\r\nlarge timber is not required. Its best use is for poles, for which\r\npurpose chestnut may be employed as nurses to oak, thinning out the\r\nformer as growth advances.\r\n\r\nDismissing, however, the subject of the economic value of the chestnut,\r\nwhether for timber or fruit, as an ornamental tree it has few equals.\r\nThere are many fine chestnut-trees in our country, but perhaps the\r\nfinest, as it is supposed to be the oldest, sylvan veteran in England is\r\nthe one at Tortworth, in Gloucestershire, of which Strutt says:—\r\n\r\n     In the reign of Stephen, who ascended the throne in 1135, it was\r\n     deemed so remarkable for its size, that, as appears upon record,\r\n     it was well known as a signal boundary to the Manor of Tortworth.\r\n     At the time that it was thus conspicuous for its magnitude and\r\n     vigour, we may reasonably suppose it to have been in its prime; if,\r\n     therefore, we pay any regard to the received opinion which is\r\n     applied to the chestnut, equally with the oak, that it is three\r\n     hundred years in coming to perfection, this calculation takes us\r\n     back to the beginning of the reign of Egbert, in the year 800, for\r\n     the commencement of the existence of the Tortworth Chestnut.\r\n\r\nWell then may we exclaim with the poet—\r\n\r\n    Hail, old patrician trees, so great and good!\r\n\r\nThe Walnut (_Juglans regia_) is supposed to have been introduced from\r\nPersia by the Romans; but although we can have no claim to it as a\r\nnative, yet it has thriven so remarkably well, as for many years since\r\nto have furnished us with a large quantity of a highly valuable timber.\r\nSo much indeed is its wood esteemed, as to have caused its use only in\r\nthe better kinds of cabinet-work, such as drawing-room furniture,\r\ninternal fittings, and where mahogany would now be considered as\r\nsomewhat common; it has, too, been ever esteemed as a wood for\r\ngun-stocks, as it combines hardness, toughness, and an agreeable colour\r\nwith a great degree of lightness—being of a less specific gravity than\r\nthat of any other kind of hard wood.\r\n\r\nFowling-pieces, gentlemen’s rifles, pistols, and all the finer kinds of\r\nsmall arms, usually have stocks of walnut, as its texture, colour, and\r\nthe sharpness with which fancy carvings can be worked, peculiarly adapt\r\nit for the purpose.\r\n\r\nDuring the continental war, English walnut fetched an enormous price.\r\nSelby tells us that a single tree was sold for £600, owing to which\r\nmany of the noblest specimens were sacrificed; and Loudon tells us that,\r\nabout 1806, no less than 12,000 trees were annually required for these\r\nuses in France.\r\n\r\nIn England this tree is principally grown for its fruit, which is a\r\ngreat favourite when ripe as an adjunct to the social glass. Still\r\nenormous quantities are never allowed to attain to ripeness, from their\r\nbeing used in a green state for the purposes of pickling, sauces, and\r\nthe like; indeed, so much is the green part of the walnut esteemed for\r\nits flavouring properties, that the very “hulls,” or coverings to the\r\nripened fruits, are employed as an ingredient in the preparation of\r\nsauces and flavourings.\r\n\r\nAnother use of the fruit, especially on the Continent, is that of making\r\noil, which is considered to be little, if at all, inferior to fine\r\nolive-oil.\r\n\r\nThe walnut-tree, then, may be considered as offering many claims for its\r\nmore extensive cultivation, for although native growths of timber have\r\nbeen of late years in a measure superseded by American walnut and\r\nhickory wood, still it offers no mean inducements to the planter upon\r\nthis score alone, at the same time it must be allowed that with us the\r\nchief inducement to the culture of this tree is the value of its fruit\r\nand the handsome tree which it makes.\r\n\r\nIn the growth of this and the preceding, it is always best to procure\r\ngood, healthy, young trees from the nurseryman; indeed, in planting all\r\nforest trees this may be considered as not only the best, but usually\r\nthe cheapest mode of proceeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nON THE ELM.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the critical botanist the study of the different kinds of Elm is one\r\nof the most perplexing subjects he has to cope with, the fact being,\r\nthat if the seed of any one form be cultivated, the results will seldom\r\nor never be uniform, for not only may several well-known varieties be\r\nproduced from the seed of a single tree, but even new forms may thus be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nOn this account have arisen the great discrepancies one meets with in\r\nauthors as regards nomenclature; some making many species of the Elms\r\ncommonly met with in Great Britain, while others reduce them to two;\r\nviz.—\r\n\r\n     _Ulmus campestris_—Small-leaved, Common Upright or English Elm.\r\n\r\n     _Ulmus montana_—Large-leaved, Spreading Scotch or Wych Elm.\r\n\r\nBut though these are the names used by most authors to distinguish these\r\ntwo well-recognized forms, yet they have been reversed in Dr. Arnott’s\r\nedition of Hooker’s “Flora,” thus:—\r\n\r\n     _Ulmus suberosa_ (Ehrh.)—Common or English Elm.\r\n\r\n     _Ulmus campestris_ (L.)—Broad-leaved or Wych Hazel.\r\n\r\nNow it is not our object to enter into a discussion on the much-vexed\r\nquestion of species, and therefore, without even determining whether the\r\nEnglish and Scotch Elms be absolutely distinct, we shall yet describe\r\nas two well-established forms of forest trees, and endeavour to put them\r\nin their proper position among profitable and ornamental timber trees,\r\nto which end we would distinguish them as follows:—\r\n\r\n        1. ULMUS CAMPESTRIS.                 2. ULMUS MONTANA.\r\n         (_English Elm._)                     (_Scotch Elm._)\r\n\r\n  Leaves small, doubly-notched at     Leaves larger, divided into\r\n  the margin, with an alternation     segments at the margin, which\r\n  of larger and smaller teeth         segments are notched with fine\r\n  (alternately serrate).              serrated teeth.\r\n\r\n  Fruit small and flat, with a deep   Fruit large and flat, with a slight\r\n  notch at the apex; bunches          notch at the apex; bunches large\r\n  somewhat small and inconspicuous.   and having the general\r\n                                      appearance of bunches of hops.\r\n\r\n  Branches more or less spreading,    Branches more or less upright,\r\n  inclining to be rough or even corky smooth, and even. Twigs sometimes\r\n  (_suberose_). Twigs more or less    clothed with a short down.\r\n  hairy.\r\n\r\n  Bole more or less towering upwards, Bole shorter, branching at a\r\n  its divisions having the same       moderate elevation into large\r\n  tendency. Arms more like those of   spreading arms, more like those of\r\n  the beech.                          the oak.\r\n\r\n  Roots throwing up suckers often at  Roots not stoloniferous.\r\n  a great distance from the tree.\r\n\r\n1. _Ulmus campestris._—The English Elm, though not the producer of the\r\nmost valuable timber, or of a kind for more refined purposes, is still\r\none of the most extensively useful of any kind whatsoever. The long\r\nstraight balks of this Elm caused it at one time to be employed for\r\nwater-pipes; these can be readily cut into boards of great length and\r\nwidth, which are useful for a variety of purposes. Selby sums up an\r\naccount of its character as follows:—\r\n\r\n     The wood when matured is of a deep-brown colour, compact and\r\n     fine-grained; according to Loudon, it loses nearly two-thirds of\r\n     its weight in drying, as when cut it weighs nearly seventy pounds\r\n     the cubic foot, and when seasoned not more than twenty-eight pounds\r\n     and a half. In the lateral adhesion of its fibre it surpasses the\r\n     _U. montana_, though perhaps inferior to it in longitudinal\r\n     toughness, and therefore not capable of supporting so severe a\r\n     cross strain. The former property, however, eminently qualifies it\r\n     for every purpose where a strong wood that will not split or crack,\r\n     either from concussion or the action of sun and wet, is required;\r\n     on this account, Matthew, in his able treatise on naval timber,\r\n     strongly recommends it for the “blocks, dead-eyes, and other wooden\r\n     furniture of rigging.” In country carpentry it is very extensively\r\n     used in all the Southern parts of England; but the purposes to\r\n     which it is applied it is unnecessary to enumerate, these having\r\n     already been described by Evelyn and subsequent authors. Its\r\n     durability under water, as well as the straightness and great\r\n     length of its stem, qualifies it for making the keels of large\r\n     ships, for which purpose it sells at a very high price.\r\n\r\nAs an ornamental tree for general purposes, few can surpass the elm, as\r\nwhen well-grown and not too much interfered with by the forester, it has\r\na gracefully aspiring form without a disposition to lankiness: its\r\nfoliage is thick enough to afford any amount of shade, and yet is never\r\nof a heavy appearance.\r\n\r\nIt flourishes best in good deep soil, in which the most solid balks are\r\ngrown: when planted on poor land or on gravel-beds it decays at the\r\nheart at a very early age. Some of the English elms in Hyde Park have\r\nthus decayed, whilst others have attained a respectable size and age,\r\nhaving been injured by storms:—\r\n\r\n    The wintry winds had passed\r\n      And swept an arm away,\r\n    And winter found a wound at last,\r\n      In which to work decay.\r\n\r\nIn good soil the English elm grows to an enormous size, remaining\r\nperfectly solid to a good old age. We remember the felling of a tree\r\ncalled “Piff’s Elm,” on the high-road between Cheltenham and Tewkesbury,\r\nin which the hole measured 28 feet in circumference at 4 feet from the\r\nground, and we counted 198 rings of annual growth. Still, when grown in\r\npoor gravelly soils and in the usual hedge mode, in which they are\r\nperiodically shrouded and crippled, they often begin to decay in the\r\ncentre at less than twenty years of age.\r\n\r\nThere are varieties of the _U. campestris_, which, as they are not of\r\nany particular importance as timber trees, need only be lightly touched\r\nupon in this place. They are as follows:—\r\n\r\n     1. _Ulmus suberosa_—Cork Elm, bark of the limbs exceedingly corky.\r\n\r\n     2. _Ulmus carpinifolia_—Hornbeam-leaved Elm, leaves\r\n     strongly-veined, serratures blunt; branches nearly smooth.\r\n\r\n     3. _Ulmus stricta_—Cornish Elm, leaves smooth and shining above,\r\n     doubly serrated, with obtuse teeth; branches bright-brown, smooth,\r\n     erect.\r\n\r\n     4. _Ulmus glabra_—Small-leaved Elm, leaves small and smooth;\r\n     branches pendulous.\r\n\r\n2. _Ulmus montana._—The Scotch Elm, the broad-leaved elm (wych hazel) of\r\nmost parts of England and Scotland, is well distinguished by its large\r\nbroad leaves, hop-like fruits, large limbs diverging from a less\r\ntowering trunk at an obtuse angle, branches more or less lax and\r\npendulous, bark of the twigs dark brown, smooth and not corky; of stem\r\nwhen rough, not _suberose_.\r\n\r\nThis tree is reputed wild, but there seems reason to think that this\r\nform, and certainly the _U. campestris_, has been introduced. One reason\r\nfor this conclusion is that although the _U. montana_ produces such an\r\nenormous amount of seed, yet, in as far as we know, none of this\r\nproduces young trees, or, in other words, this elm does not appear to\r\nincrease sporadically. Even in cultivation it is found to be exceedingly\r\ndifficult to replenish our nursery stock from seed, and hence the cost\r\nof young plants, as they have to be produced from suckers, or otherwise\r\nlayered, and occasionally grown from cuttings. Evelyn says:—\r\n\r\n     It seems to be so much more addicted to some places than to others,\r\n     that I have frequently doubted whether it be a pure indigene or\r\n     translatitious; and not only because I have hardly ever known any\r\n     considerable woods of them (besides some few nurseries near\r\n     Cambridge, planted, I suppose, for store), but most continually in\r\n     tufts, hedge-rows, and mounds; and that Shropshire, and several\r\n     other counties, have rarely any growing in many miles\r\n     together.—_Sylva_, vol. i. p. 127.\r\n\r\nTo this may be added the fact that the most notable elm trees will\r\nusually be found at cross-roads—as Maul’s Elm at Cheltenham, nearly 40\r\nfeet in circumference, or about dwellings; the fine old trunk at the\r\nSlade Farm, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, as much as 50 feet, for some\r\ntime hollow, and once used as a cider-mill; the fine elms in our parks,\r\nas at Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens, and others; and such avenues of\r\nelms as seen at Christchurch.\r\n\r\nAs a timber tree the Scotch elm is not esteemed so highly as is the\r\nEnglish sort. To begin with, it does not grow such straight even balks;\r\nit is more gnarled and knotty in sawing, and more difficult to work.\r\nSelby says that Scottish writers have arrived at a different conclusion,\r\nwhich he conceives to have arisen from the fact that “their estimate has\r\nbeen drawn from a comparison of the wood of _U. montana_ with that of\r\n_U. suberosa_ (considered by them to be the English elm), which produces\r\na soft, spongy wood, greatly inferior to most other trees of the genus.”\r\n\r\nIt is used for flooring and rough country work. The peculiar wen-like\r\nexcrescences that one sometimes meets with on the sides of wych elms are\r\ncarefully preserved and cut into veneers for fine loo-tables,\r\nwork-boxes, and other purposes, when a peculiar mottled fine-coloured\r\nwood is required for fancy-work.\r\n\r\nSome of the finest elms we have examined have been Maul’s elm, Piff’s\r\nelm, the Slade elm, before mentioned, and the following, measured at one\r\nand three feet from the ground.\r\n\r\n                                                   Circum. at  Circum. at\r\n                                                    1 foot.     3 feet.\r\n\r\n  _Ulmus montana_,    Oakley Park, Cirencester      38  0       33  6\r\n    Ditto,            Hyde Park                      —          20  6\r\n    Ditto,            Hyde Park                      —          20  0\r\n    Ditto,            group of twelve in Kensington\r\n                      Gardens, varying to            —          20  0\r\n  _Ulmus campestris_, Hyde Park, several varying\r\n                      from 20 ft. to                 —          30  0\r\n    Ditto,            in Oakley Park, from\r\n                      15 ft. to                      —          22  0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nON THE ASH, BEECH, AND OTHER WHITE-WOODED TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASH (_Fraxinus excelsior_), when well-grown and in good\r\nfoliage, is one of our most charming trees; its light, graceful, and\r\nagreeably-coloured leaves, united with a graceful disposition of lithe,\r\nsmoothly-formed limbs, altogether fully entitle it to be considered as\r\nthe “Venus of the Forest.”\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the common ash are pinnate, with from three to four pairs\r\nof leaflets and one terminal leaflet. This latter is sometimes absent\r\nwhen the apex is bifoliate, and a form called the double-leaf is\r\nproduced, which even at this day is reputed by the rustics to be capable\r\nof working various charms.\r\n\r\nIt is this pinnate pendent leaf which, loosely hanging on the flexile,\r\nmore or less pendent branches, gives so much grace to the tree.\r\n\r\nWe have been much pleased with some groups of ash trees in Earl\r\nBathurst’s park (Oakley Park) at Cirencester; but, as Strutt well\r\nobserves,—\r\n\r\n     It is in mountain scenery that the ash appears to peculiar\r\n     advantage; waving its slender branches over some precipice which\r\n     just affords it soil sufficient for its footing, or springing\r\n     between crevices of rock, a happy emblem of the hardy spirit which\r\n     will not be subdued by fortune’s scantiness. It is likewise a\r\n     lovely object by the side of some crystal stream, in which it views\r\n     its elegant pendent foliage, bending, Narcissus-like, over its own\r\n     charms.\r\n\r\nBut charming as is the ash when in its most perfect foliage, yet as its\r\næstivation is usually so late, and the fall of its leaves so early and\r\nrapid, it often displays all but naked limbs, even amidst the freshness\r\nof spring, as well as during the autumnal tinting of almost all other\r\ntrees. It would seem that its buds cannot expand in spring frosts,\r\nwhilst the first frost of autumn will frequently make the whole foliage\r\ndrop in one mass beneath the influence of the succeeding sunshine. This\r\nsusceptibility to spring cold is doubtless at the base of the country\r\nweather predictions which are made to depend upon the behaviour of the\r\nash in respect to its time of displaying its leaves:—\r\n\r\n    When the oak’s before the ash,\r\n    You may then expect a dash.\r\n\r\nGenerally held to mean, that if the leaves of the oak are seen before\r\nthose of the ash, a fine dry summer may be expected; but, on the\r\ncontrary,—\r\n\r\n    With the ash before the oak,\r\n    You may then expect a soak.\r\n\r\nThe truth of all this may be that a cold wet spring, which would retard\r\nthe bursting of the buds of the ash, may be expected to be followed by a\r\nfine summer; whilst, on the contrary, a genial forward spring is often\r\nsucceeded by a wet summer.\r\n\r\nSelby remarks on the early fall of the leaf, which, as he says, is\r\n“after the first autumnal frost, however early that may happen; and\r\nthis, in general, without undergoing any change of colour, or\r\ncontributing by the ’sear and yellow leaf’ to the waning beauty of\r\nautumnal foliage.” On this account, Sir T. D. Lauder recommends that\r\n“ash trees should be sparingly planted around a gentleman’s residence,\r\nto avoid the risk of their giving to it a cold, late appearance, at a\r\nseason when all nature should smile.”\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that although the ash seems to be so susceptible of\r\ncold, it nevertheless ripens its seeds most perfectly in any part of\r\nGreat Britain; and besides this, these seeds, or “keys,” when naturally\r\nsown, come up with the greatest certainty, so that young ash may be\r\nremoved from the wood and used for planting.\r\n\r\nThis renders it easy to cultivate young plants from seed; to which end,\r\nwhen the ripened keys are gathered in the autumn, they should be well\r\nexamined to see that the seed has not been eaten out by the ash-weevil,\r\nas it will most certainly be if a small orifice be observable on one\r\nside of the key or samara, just over the seed.\r\n\r\nIn growing ash with a view to profit, it is recommended to plant it by\r\nitself in belts or plantations, which are called ash-holts, as it\r\nusually, when well started, grows upwards too fast to be a good nurse to\r\nother trees, which latter would suffer from the whipping of the longer\r\nheavy flexile stems of the ash.[29]\r\n\r\n[29] Selby says, “The pitting system should always be adopted in\r\nplanting the ash, for the roots, even in young plants, are too numerous,\r\nlarge, and spreading, to be properly inserted by the splitting or [T]\r\nmethod.” We would also add, that they should be planted as soon upon\r\nremoval as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is too often planted in hedge-rows, where it is exceedingly\r\nobjectionable, not only from the ill effects on the scene of\r\ninterminable rows of one kind of tree, but the drip and the peculiar\r\ngrowth of the roots render it most destructive to the growth of crops\r\nplanted beneath its shade.\r\n\r\nThe uses to which the wood of this tree is turned are multifarious in\r\nthe extreme. Walking-sticks are made from ash saplings; and as, from\r\nyouth to age, it is so tough and elastic, it is used for handles and\r\nother parts of farm implements and machinery of all kinds. The\r\nwheelwright and coachmaker employ the wood extensively; so also the\r\ncooper. As a firewood its “offal” is always welcome, as it burns with a\r\nclear, bright flame, and that nearly as well in the green as in the dry\r\nstate; and the whole tree is so rich in potash that this alkali is often\r\nmade from its trimmings and loppings.\r\n\r\nWe had already mentioned some of the superstitions connected with the\r\nash, and at p. 250 will be found directions for making a shrew-ash; we\r\nshall now, therefore, only direct attention to another practice which\r\nthis tree was employed for, even to a somewhat recent period, as it will\r\naccount for some curious growths of ash which will sometimes be met\r\nwith. Evelyn says:—\r\n\r\n     I have heard it affirmed with great confidence, and upon\r\n     experience, that the rupture to which many children are obnoxious,\r\n     is healed, by passing the infant through a wide cleft made in the\r\n     bole or stem of the growing ash-tree; it is then carried a second\r\n     time round the ash, and caused to repass the same aperture as\r\n     before. The rupture of the child being bound up, it is supposed to\r\n     heal as the cleft of the tree closes and coalesces.\r\n\r\nAs, then, the healing of the child would seem to depend upon that of\r\nthe tree, this potent charm is not always successful, as may be gathered\r\nfrom the fact that young trees have been met with which never healed at\r\nall, and we recollect one of these, of which the accompanying wood-cut\r\nis a copy, having been presented at a Conversazione of the\r\nWorcestershire Natural History Society. The tree from whence it was\r\ntaken was of about ten years of age. Selby says that an instance of this\r\nuse of the ash is “related by the Rev. T. Bree, in the _Magazine of\r\nNatural History_, where a ruptured child was made to pass through the\r\nchasm of a young ash-tree, split for the purpose, in Warwickshire.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThese facts seem to point to the acting upon such superstitions to\r\nwithin a comparatively recent period, though doubtless the drawing a\r\nchild beneath the stolon or shoot of a bramble that has rooted at its\r\nextremity, and which we have known to be gravely recommended by a wise\r\n(!) woman, would be equally efficacious, and, upon the whole, easier to\r\nperform.\r\n\r\nEvelyn further says that “the chemists exceedingly commend the seed of\r\nthe ash to be an admirable remedy for the stone.” “But,” he adds,\r\n“whether by the power of magic or nature, I determine not.” We would\r\nsuggest that it was by the power its roots possess of riving the natural\r\nrock. So stone-crop, from decomposing the stones on which it grows, was\r\nheld to have the like effect. How strange, then, it is that with such\r\nevidences of the truth of the motto,—\r\n\r\n    Similia similibus curantur,\r\n\r\nphysicians of the present day should refuse to listen to this still (and\r\nvery small) voice of nature, and not all become homœopaths! Such may\r\nwell be the reasoning of many an old woman who still pretends to cures\r\neither by magic spells or infinitesimal globules.\r\n\r\nTwo interesting varieties of ash are met with: the pendulous or\r\nweeping-ash, which, Sir W. Hooker informs us, is said to have been first\r\ndiscovered in a field at Gamlingay, and the _Fraxinus heterophylla_, in\r\nwhich the leaf is simple, that is, it is in one piece, more the form of\r\na laurel-leaf than the usual pinnated ash-leaf. These variations are\r\neasily perpetuated by grafting, and are here only mentioned on account\r\nof their peculiar habits.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE BEECH (_Fagus sylvatica_) is admitted by all authors to be a native\r\nof Great Britain, and if the many magnificent giants one here and there\r\nmeets with be admitted as proofs of indigenous origin, few trees can put\r\nin a more imposing claim. The celebrated Burnham beeches, so well known\r\nto artists and lovers of nature in general, and the many fine examples\r\nof this tree in the Cotteswolds, upon which range it is said to grow as\r\na weed, testify to the age and size to which the beech may attain.\r\n\r\nThe plantations of beeches in Oakley Park are well worthy of note in\r\nspeaking of the Cotteswolds, for although they have been planted here,\r\nyet the fine, tall, clean balks, lofty tops, and the “twilight shades”\r\nbeneath, will not soon be forgotten by the author, who, beneath their\r\nboughs, through the liberality of Earl Bathurst, “has felt them all his\r\nown,” as says the poet Gray of the Burnham beeches. Here, too, has he\r\nmused, though not, like Pope, in “thoughts that burn,” yet much\r\nwondering at the curious plants which choose such seclusion for their\r\ndwelling. Of these the following may be here enumerated, as they really\r\nform part of the natural history of the beech wood:—\r\n\r\n     _Listera Nidus-avis_—Birds’-nest Orchis.\r\n\r\n     _Habenaria chlorantha_—Butterfly Orchis.\r\n\r\n     _Epipactis grandiflora_—Large White Helleborine.\r\n\r\n     _Epipactis ensifolia_—Narrow-leaved White Helleborine.\r\n\r\n     _Epipactis latifolia_—Broad-leaved Helleborine.\r\n\r\n     _Monotropa Hypopithys_—Yellow Birds’-nest.\r\n\r\n     _Pyrola minor_—Lesser Winter Green.\r\n\r\nSuch a list of plants found in the beech woods is sufficient to make\r\ntheir locality remarkable, and if we add to them the\r\n\r\n     _Tuber cibarium_—Truffle,\r\n\r\n     _Morchella esculenta_—Morell,\r\n\r\n     _Elaphomyces muricatus_—Sharp-warted _Elaphomyces_,\r\n\r\n—these, with various other curious fungi, will be sufficient to make\r\nOakley Park and its beeches a botanical habitat of no mean pretension.\r\n\r\nAs regards the truffle, we may mention that we have heard that a former\r\nEarl Bathurst kept dogs for the purpose of hunting them. We have\r\npartaken of the morells from this park several times, and always found\r\nthem delicious, and can recommend them stuffed with sausage-meat and\r\nfried, as a dish for an epicure: we have seen them exposed for sale in\r\nthe greengrocers’ shops of the good old town of Cirencester.\r\n\r\nBut we are sadly digressing from the subject of the beech tree in his\r\nhistory as a forest and ornamental tree. Under the latter aspect, then,\r\nmost authors, except Gilpin, view the beech to hold a very high place.\r\nColeman, in his “Woodlands,” considers that,—\r\n\r\n     Among our truly indigenous forest-trees, the beech must certainly\r\n     rank as second only to the oak for majesty and picturesqueness;\r\n     while, for the union of grace and nobility, it may claim precedence\r\n     over every other member of our sylva.\r\n\r\n     Having said this, we must, as a matter of course, dissent from the\r\n     opinion of Gilpin, the highly-gifted author of “Forest Scenery,”\r\n     who has, as we think, unjustly impugned the ornamental character of\r\n     this generally favourite tree, and this because he had some\r\n     crotchets of his own about landscape composition, and the shape\r\n     that trees ought to take to make them good subjects for the pencil.\r\n     The beech did not happen to fit itself to his theory, and so he\r\n     quarrelled with it, and called it hard names.\r\n\r\nAny one who has ever seen a well-grown beech tree, such as was once our\r\ndelight to visit at Hartley Bottom, near the source of the Thames, or\r\nwho has seen such masses of beech glowing with autumnal tints as may be\r\nwitnessed in a journey on the Great Western Railway between Swindon and\r\nCheltenham, will never speak disparagingly of the beech, which we think\r\nnoble, alike by itself as in masses, or as a sylvan denizen with other\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nBut it has other claims besides that of ornament; it is a highly useful\r\nwood, much employed in carpentry, cabinet-work, and turnery; in the\r\nmaking of charcoal; and increasingly so in the manufacture of\r\nwood-spirit.\r\n\r\nAs a firewood it excels most others, as it burns with a clear flame,\r\neven when wet, and leaves behind only a small quantity of ash. How,\r\nindeed, could it possess much ash when it flourishes in positions where\r\nscarcely four inches of soil covers up the oolitic stone, its roots\r\nspreading over the rock and occasionally dipping into its fissures in a\r\nmanner most aptly illustrative of the fact that this tree really derives\r\nbut little nutrition from the soil, the rocks upon which it grows, for\r\nthe most part, serving to moor the giant in position that it may spread\r\nforth its leaves to feed upon the atmosphere?\r\n\r\nThe beech is easily propagated from its fruit—“mast”—which, indeed, so\r\nreadily grows beneath the trees that thousands might be obtained for the\r\npurpose of pricking out in nursery lines, if looked after. The usual\r\nmethod of cultivation is to gather the mast in the autumn, to keep it\r\nwell in sand, and sow in the spring. After two years it is pricked out\r\nin nursery rows, and is fit for planting in three years more.\r\n\r\nWhere once established it will soon spread, as the mast grows\r\nsporadically with great readiness, and this tree has a faculty for\r\nextending undisputed possession; thus, in America will be found\r\nwide-extended forests of scarcely anything but beech, which, though\r\nperhaps a little varied from our own, is yet doubtless of the same\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThere are several ornamental varieties of beech to be obtained from the\r\nnurserymen, some of which are more curious than useful; but we must not\r\nomit to mention the Copper Beech (_Fagus sylvatica_, var. _purpurea_).\r\nThis, judiciously disposed, is capable of affording a great charm to the\r\nwood, and more especially in plantations near the homestead. They are\r\nfast-growing trees, and at present are here and there to be met with of\r\nconsiderable size. We once possessed a couple on our lawn, the largest\r\nof which must have been nearly six feet in circumference; and what from\r\nits colour, the thickness of its foliage, and the fine sweep of its\r\nbranches, it was capable of yielding shade and shelter of a most perfect\r\nand agreeable kind.\r\n\r\nThe drip of the beech is prejudicial to cultivation, we think, from the\r\ncircumstance that the hard, though thin, leaves are so difficult of\r\ndecomposition that where they fall they leave a thick carpet covering up\r\nthe ground. If, then, these trees are in such a position as to do\r\nmischief from this cause, the leaves should be removed, and they will,\r\nif stored, be found very useful in making hotbeds, linings to pots, and\r\nother gardening work.\r\n\r\nBeech is less liable to insect attacks than almost any other tree; the\r\nmost annoying is that of the _Aphis_, especially when near the house, as\r\nthis harbours insects of all kinds, and the exuding honey-dew much\r\ninjures the aspect of the tree.\r\n\r\nBeech timber would be more valuable than it is were it not for its\r\nliability, when in panels, tables, and furniture, to be attacked and\r\nbored by weevils. We once had our house so infested with these little\r\nbeetles, derived from some furniture of this wood, as to cause\r\nconsiderable alarm; but fortunately our domestic’s knowledge of natural\r\nhistory in the matter of bugs was somewhat defective, as she had\r\nmistaken the nature of the weevil. This pest can be removed by boiling\r\nin oil; but it is a great drawback to the use of a wood which otherwise\r\nmight be applied to various domestic purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nON SOFT-WOODED FOREST TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we shall shortly direct attention to such soft-wooded\r\ntrees as the sycamore, plane, horse-chestnut, lime, willow, poplar, and\r\nothers, which, though commonly grown, are yet more so for ornament than\r\nprofit; for though their woods are found to be more or less useful, as a\r\ngeneral rule they must take a comparatively low rank as timber trees.\r\n\r\nBoth the Sycamore and the Plane are introduced trees; both attain to a\r\nlarge size; and when judiciously mixed with other trees form a very\r\npleasing contrast. The plane has the property of withstanding the\r\neffects of smoke in towns better than any other tree, and therefore it\r\nis recommended for planting in public parks and town enclosures.\r\n\r\nThe Horse-Chestnut has much of the character of the above; it grows tall\r\nand large, and its fine foliage and handsome bunches of flowers are very\r\nattractive. It is an excellent tree for shade, and has the merit of\r\nquick growth; but its wood is so brittle as to cause great limbs to be\r\ntoo readily blown off with a high wind.\r\n\r\nThe Lime (_Tilia Europæa_) is one of our most charming native trees, for\r\nso it has been pretty clearly proved to be by E. Lees, Esq., F.L.S., who\r\nsays “that at Shrawley, eight miles north from Worcester, there is a\r\nwood, remote from any dwelling or public road, of about five hundred\r\nacres in extent, the greater part of the undergrowth of which is\r\ncomposed of _Tilia Europæa_, var. _Microphylla_;” and the same\r\ngentleman, in a communication to the Botanical Society of London,\r\nmentioned several places, in Worcestershire, Herefordshire,\r\nGloucestershire, Monmouthshire, and South Wales, where he considers the\r\nlime to be indigenous, and where he met with many remarkable and aged\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nWe shall not here enter into a discussion about species, but, from what\r\nwe saw in Shrawley wood and its district, we incline to the belief that\r\nseveral names made to depend mainly upon the leaves, might well be\r\nomitted, seeing that from Shrawley itself the leaves on the newly-sprung\r\nunderwood are fully five times larger than those on an old tree.\r\n\r\nPutting such questions aside, we may well consider the lime as a truly\r\nornamental tree, _whose varieties_ give great charm to the forest or the\r\nmore limited plantation about the homestead, where its shade, its\r\nperfume when in flower, and patience under lopping and training, must\r\never recommend it.\r\n\r\nThe Willow, though usually cultivated in the shape of twigs for\r\nbasket-making and the like purposes, for which many species are\r\nemployed, is nevertheless grown upon the margins of streams and in damp\r\nplaces about estates and farms for its lop, which is much used for\r\nhurdle-bonds, thatching-spars, &c.\r\n\r\nAmongst implements from this tree, the willow-wand of the cricketer has\r\nnow a fame in the New as well as in the Old world, and long may its\r\nmagic continue to develope the muscle and sharpen the faculties of the\r\nyouth of Old England; whilst well-developed muscle cannot better\r\nmaintain its tone than by a well-contested game of cricket.\r\n\r\nIn good situations the White Willow (_Salix alba_) attains to very\r\nmagnificent proportions. One at Siddington, near Cirencester, measures\r\n22 feet in girth, at one foot from the ground; 18 ft. 6 in. at three\r\nfeet; and 20 ft. 6 in. at six feet. The principal limb measured 12 ft. 6\r\nin., and the circumference of its fine top is as much as 72 feet. And\r\nfour trees by the Roman Amphitheatre at Cirencester, average somewhere\r\nabout 12 feet round at six feet from the ground. Trees of this size,\r\nfrom their light, silvery foliage, give great character to the\r\nsurrounding scenery.\r\n\r\nThese soft-wooded trees, with some poplar and other ornamental trees,\r\nfurnish a more or less light, soft, spongy wood, very inferior for\r\ntimber, but yet capable of being put to various uses in turnery,\r\ninternal work, &c., in which white wood is employed.\r\n\r\nThe _Coniferæ_ (Cone-bearers).—The Fir tribe may well form a subject\r\neven for a separate volume, for not only are some of them employed as\r\ntimber trees, but many are grown for their curious and interesting\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nThe _Pinetum_ has become to be a matter of amusement to many a country\r\ngentleman throughout the country; and in these are collected such new\r\nforms as may in time become useful to the planter, as well as such\r\nminute species as may illustrate the natural history of a subject well\r\nworthy of extended study.\r\n\r\nAmongst our giants of this natural order may be placed the yew (which\r\nhas been made a separate order under the name of _Taxaceæ_) and the\r\ncedar; the spruce-fir, Scotch-pine, and larch being the more useful\r\nmembers as timber trees.\r\n\r\nThe Yew (_Taxus baccata_) is generally considered as an indigenous tree,\r\nand as we can certainly point to individuals that must have weathered\r\nnearly, if not quite a thousand years, we are not disposed to quarrel\r\nwith the conclusion. Its former use in the construction of the English\r\nlong-bow is now obsolete, and so too has almost died out the taste for\r\ngrowing this tree to torture into grotesque shapes. Still, as a\r\npicturesque tree in woodland and home scenery, and even as an attendant\r\nupon the parish church, we should like to see the yew more extensively\r\ngrown. It is also a most useful tree for close hedges and blinds in the\r\ngarden, as it will bear being clipped within due bounds with a great\r\namount of patience.\r\n\r\nThe Cedar (_Cedrus Libani_), which was probably introduced to this\r\ncountry towards the end of the seventeenth century, has yet made such\r\nprogress as to rival in size and importance many of our more stately\r\nnative timber trees of far greater age.\r\n\r\nAmongst the more stately examples of this tree, we may mention those at\r\nthe Chelsea Botanical Garden. There are some fine groups in Oakley Park,\r\nCirencester, growing on almost a bare rock of the Great or Bath Oolite,\r\nand in the bleak Cotteswold country, attaining the circumference of from\r\n10 to 12 feet, at three feet from the ground. Long may the cedar be\r\ncultivated for the size and beauty to which it can attain, in which,\r\nperhaps, it may yet be excelled by the _Cedrus deodara_, not many years\r\nsince introduced from the Himalayas. We rejoice to see such noble\r\nspecimens of vegetation grown, independent of profit, which, indeed, is\r\nscarcely needed by a princely possessor of a fine estate handed down,\r\nperhaps, from generation to generation, in which each tree may have a\r\nhistory of its own.\r\n\r\nThe Spruce-Fir (_Abies excelsa_) is an elegant tree in composition, and\r\ngrows well on the thinnest and poorest soils. Its upright, tapering\r\nmode of growth renders it a good nurse, with beech, larch, and other\r\n_Coniferæ_. It may be planted thickly; the first thinning being used for\r\nhop-poles, the next for spars, masts, &c.; and ultimately a few may be\r\nleft to attain size and height as shelter and for effect.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch Pine (_Pinus sylvestris_) is a native of North Britain, where\r\nits fine trees in large forests or in great clumps, form a peculiar and\r\nat times magnificent appearance. It is much used in planting in this\r\ncountry, principally as a nurse; but its young sticks are not so durable\r\nas those of the spruce, and much inferior to the larch. Its larger wood\r\nforms the red deal—a timber so much used in all kinds of carpentry as to\r\ngive this tree a high value among timber trees.\r\n\r\nThe Larch (_Larix Europæa_) is a deciduous tree of the order, and though\r\nit has not been introduced into general use for very many years, yet its\r\nvalue is daily becoming more fully developed; and as a tree for general\r\nplantation, either as a nurse or in belts, it has few, if any, equals.\r\nAs a curious tree, it appears to have been grown early in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and some fine trees are noticed by Selby at Dalwick in\r\nPeeblesshire, and at Monzie in Argyleshire. The largest larch which we\r\nhave noticed was one which was felled in Oakley Park.\r\n\r\nIt had previously been injured by being struck with lightning, by which\r\nlarge pieces of the bark had been torn away. We examined it at Lord\r\nBathurst’s desire, when it was found to be bored into from the base of\r\nthe trunk to as high as we could see, by that curious insect the _Sirex\r\ngigas_, whose hornet-like appearance causes so much consternation in the\r\npine forests in Germany, from which it is often introduced into the\r\ndwellings of the peasant with fir logs. It is quite as large as the\r\nhornet, and much of the same bright colours, but its apparent sting of\r\nmore than half an inch in length is only an ovipositor, so that that\r\nformidable-looking creature is perfectly harmless after all. This tree\r\nwas nearly twelve feet in circumference, at three feet from the ground,\r\nin which condition its lower drooping branches give the larch a fine\r\npicturesque appearance.\r\n\r\nLarches, and, indeed, the whole of the _Coniferæ_, are best procured for\r\nplanting from the nursery, and much time will ultimately be saved by\r\nplanting them as soon after removal as possible, and that by the pit\r\nmethod; and so done, larch, unlike most other young trees, shoots away\r\nat once, and soon allows of thinning to profit.\r\n\r\nWe now bring this subject to an end, for the want of space; but we\r\ncannot part with friends we love so much without a benediction; in the\r\nwords of Cowley then we say,—\r\n\r\n    Hail, old patrician trees!\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.\r\n\r\n     Plate I.

This paucity of species,\r\nhowever, is amply compensated for in an extended and constantly\r\nextending list of _sorts_, or varieties, which, in both species, amount\r\nto several hundreds.\r\n\r\nThe apple, which we shall first describe, is admitted on all hands to be\r\nderived from the wild crab-apple (_Pyrus malus_), which is considered to\r\nbe a native tree, to which position its general appearance in woods and\r\nhedges all over the island would seem to give it no small claim.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the crab is exceedingly austere, and hence sour-tempered\r\npeople are said to be “crabbed.” The expressed juice makes a strong\r\nvinegar, called “Verjuice”—in the vulgar, “Varjes”—and hence Akerman, in\r\nhis “Wiltshire Tales,” has given a cross-grained woman the name of\r\n“Mistress Varjes.” Verjuice is a very popular remedy for sprains and\r\nbruises, and hence on most farms having trees of crab-apples, the fruit\r\nis made into vinegar, and kept separately for medicinal or domestic use.\r\n\r\nThe wild crab is very various in the size, colour, and flavour of its\r\nfruit, varying in the latter point from an austerity that, on biting an\r\napple, would make one wince again, to that of an agreeable acid flavour,\r\nalmost equal to some of our domestic apples.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration this disposition to run into varieties, even\r\nin a wild state, we shall not be surprised that, in cultivation, the\r\nsorts of apples should be endless, so much so, indeed, that Don, in his\r\n“General System of Gardening and Botany,” has copied a list[30] in which\r\nare described no less than one thousand four hundred sorts, and in a\r\nnurseryman’s list now before us, “Descriptive Catalogue of Fruit Trees,\r\nby John Scott, of Merriott Nurseries, Crewkerne, Somerset,” are\r\ndescribed as many as one hundred and sixty-six sorts, which he is\r\nprepared to supply to purchasers.\r\n\r\n[30] This list was made out by the Horticultural Society in 1832, and\r\nmay now be considerably augmented.\r\n\r\nAs an evidence of the facility with which new sorts can be obtained,\r\nthere is scarcely a country town or place in orchard districts but has\r\ngiven its name to some apple. Thus we have Canadian Pippin, Newtown\r\nPippin, Carlisle and Keswick Codlin, Hawthenden, &c.; and the names of\r\nfruit-growers and others attached to apples is almost endless; as thus:\r\nAshmead’s Kernel, Nelson’s Codlin, Lucombe’s Seedling, Lord Nelson, Lord\r\nRaglan, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nThe subject of “sorts,” as applied to fruit, is one of great interest,\r\nas the facility with which these can be obtained renders it possible to\r\nprocure fruit possessing very different properties and capabilities,\r\nadapted, not only to a great variety of uses, but with powers of\r\nadaptation to different soils, and a wide range of climatic differences.\r\n\r\nThese powers of adaptation have, indeed, resulted in the preservation of\r\nmany sorts, but it also causes the neglect of some others; for as\r\nfashion takes up with new favourites old ones are neglected until they\r\ndie out, and, if not become entirely lost, their stocks are lessened, so\r\nthat the chance of a good choice for their continuance becomes more\r\ndifficult year by year. We believe this to have more to do with the\r\ndecline of old favourites than any inherent principle of decay with\r\nwhich grafts are said to be endowed.\r\n\r\nThe many sorts of apples differing so much in flavour and keeping\r\npowers, enable this fruit to be employed for a variety of purposes, such\r\nas—\r\n\r\n     _Culinary Apples_, used for tarts, puddings, &c., &c.;\r\n\r\n     _Dessert Apples_, usually of a sweet sub-acid flavour and crisp\r\n     texture, eaten raw;\r\n\r\n     _Cider Apples_, the expressed juice of which forms English Cider\r\n     (_Cidre_, French).\r\n\r\nThe same distinctions apply to pears, with the difference that their\r\njuice is termed Perry.\r\n\r\nNow, with regard to the two first, we need here only mention them\r\nincidentally, as their description belongs more properly to the\r\nhorticulturist, or pomologist, than to the farmer; at the same time it\r\nmust be confessed that both culinary and dessert apples may be made a\r\nsource of profit by the farmer, as they would always find ready\r\npurchasers; but the difficulty a farmer meets with in their cultivation\r\nresults from the circumstance that it is not easy to exert that\r\nwatchfulness over broad acres necessary to protect sweet apples from the\r\npredatory urchins with which every country parish abounds, a propensity,\r\nindeed, not sufficiently checked by the elders, whose plea that “it is\r\nonly a few apples, and that children will be children,” affords just\r\nthat amount of encouragement which too often ends in more serious acts\r\nof larceny.\r\n\r\nAs regards cider fruit, we would here dissent from the common belief\r\nthat sour apples are the best for cider-making. We believe that the\r\nsweeter the apple, and the higher the specific gravity of the juice, the\r\nbetter the cider. Many, then, of our culinary and dessert apples would\r\nmake most excellent drink; at the same time there are many sorts that\r\nwill not “cook,” whose flesh cannot be got to become soft and pulpy, but\r\nrather hard and tough by the processes either of boiling or baking. Many\r\nsorts whose flavour is not sufficiently agreeable to be eaten raw, and\r\nyet these may yield on expression a sweet juice, resulting in a strong\r\nand agreeable cider.\r\n\r\nNow, although there can be little doubt but that the quality of cider is\r\nmuch influenced by the sort of fruit from which it is made, we are\r\ninclined to the belief that the nature of the soil has, if possible, a\r\nstill more decided influence upon the result. We therefore now direct\r\nattention to some of the best cider districts in England, which may be\r\nclassed as follows:—\r\n\r\n     Devonshire, Cider of the sweetest and richest kind;\r\n\r\n     Somersetshire, Cider rich and not so sweet;\r\n\r\n     Dorsetshire, Cider somewhat poor;\r\n\r\n     Herefordshire, Cider and Perry, very strong, but somewhat harsh;\r\n\r\n     Worcestershire, Perry and Cider, rich and not too harsh;\r\n\r\n     Gloucestershire, Cider and Perry, strong but not sweet.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing geological formations of these cider-producing counties\r\nmay be arranged as follows:—\r\n\r\n     1. Oolite Sands—Dorset, and parts of Somerset.\r\n\r\n     2. Lias—Gloucester, Somerset, and Dorset.\r\n\r\n     3. New Red Sandstone—Worcester, Devon and Hereford, in part.\r\n\r\n     4. Old Red Sandstone—Hereford and Devon.\r\n\r\n     5. Silurian System—Hereford, in part.\r\n\r\nHence, then, cider and perry are grown on the sub-soils of five\r\ngeological substrata, if, indeed, No. 1 should not here be classed with\r\nNo. 2, for the extent of orcharding upon the inferior oolite sands of\r\nSomerset and Dorset is rather due to its extension from the contiguous\r\nlias, and this on account of an occasional depth and tenacity of soil.\r\nIts produce, however, is usually inferior.\r\n\r\nIn Gloucestershire orchards always stop when the top of the lias is\r\nreached, and it is curious to see the sides of the Cotteswolds occupied\r\nwith well-to-do orchards until the oolite is reached, and then they\r\ncease altogether, except in some few instances, which are here referred\r\nto by way of warning.\r\n\r\nGloucestershire, for our present purpose, may be said to rest on liassic\r\nvalleys and oolitic hills. In the valleys are small farms with small\r\nenclosures, much of which is in orchard and meadow, whilst on the hills\r\nare large farms with fields of from 30 to 100 acres devoted to arable\r\ncultivation. Hence, then, this has brought about two sets of farms: the\r\nvale, with its fruits and dairy stock, producing good cider, perry,\r\nbutter, and cheese; the hills, mutton, wool, roots, barley, &c. Now, it\r\nhappens as a rule that the hill farmer stands higher in his profession\r\nthan he of the vale, for on the hills he can say—\r\n\r\n    “Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room.”\r\n\r\nThe skill and enterprise in breeding the magnificent Cotteswold sheep,\r\nfor which there is each year such a spirited competition, attest to this\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nNo sooner, then, does a vale farmer become possessed of sufficient\r\ncapital than he moves to the hills, and as in his former residence he\r\nhad imbibed a love for cider, his first act will be to plant an orchard\r\nat his new home; but, alas! the most successful farmer cannot command\r\ncrops in an uncongenial soil, and so it is not surprising that we should\r\nknow of instances where not even enough fruit for an annual apple\r\npudding has been produced from a Cotteswold orchard which had been\r\nplanted thirty years.\r\n\r\nApples only attain to perfection on deep tenacious soils, and in a\r\ngenial climate; the moment the roots get down to stones, the ends of the\r\nbranches begin to decay, and they become covered over with lichens as\r\nthickly as in wet ill-drained clays; besides this the trees look old and\r\nknotty, even in youth, a sure sign that they are not sufficiently\r\nnourished. These facts are so well known that in planting in our gardens\r\nwe prepare the soil, if not sufficiently deep and good, and make the\r\nclimate more genial by fencing and planting in sheltered situations; but\r\nthis is not possible on a large scale.\r\n\r\nPears prefer a lighter soil than apples, the new red sandstone deposit,\r\nespecially, the marls of this rock and the lias clays, when covered up,\r\nas in parts of the valley of the Severn, with sand drifts, suit pears\r\nadmirably.\r\n\r\nLike the apple, the pear is rich in sorts. It is said to be derived from\r\nthe _Pyrus communis_, which is referred to as a native tree; but though\r\nit is really wild in the temperate regions of the European continent,\r\nand in parts of Asia, there seems reason to conclude that our occasional\r\nhedge-row denizen has, after all, been derived from pear cultivation.\r\n\r\nPears for dessert are very numerous, and each year adds to the list.\r\nScott, of Crewkerne and Yeovil Nurseries, gives a list of two hundred\r\nand thirty sorts cultivated by himself, as Standards, Pyramids, and\r\nDwarf-trained for walls and espaliers. This list abounds in French names\r\ngiven by both French and Dutch horticulturists, with whom the pear is a\r\ngreat favourite.\r\n\r\nLindley, in his “Guide to the Orchard and Kitchen Garden,” describes but\r\nsix sorts of perry pears, of which there are doubtless several\r\nvarieties. They are as follows:—\r\n\r\n     ORIGIN OF NAMES.\r\n\r\n     _Barland_, from Barland, in the parish of Bosbury, Herefordshire.\r\n\r\n     _Holmore_, from the parish of Holmore, between Hereford and\r\n     Leominster.\r\n\r\n     _Huffcap_.\r\n\r\n     _Longland_, from the field in which the tree grew.\r\n\r\n     _Oldfield_, from Oldfield, near Ledbury.\r\n\r\n     _Teinton Squash_, from Teinton, in Gloucestershire.\r\n\r\nBesides these are Blakeney Red Trump Pear, Honey Pear, Moorcroft,\r\nMalvern Hill, &c. Pears, like apples, being named from places and\r\npeople, &c., each district having its own favourite sorts; but perhaps\r\nthose in the previous list are the favourite.\r\n\r\nThis subject of variety in both apple and pear is interesting, as it has\r\ngiven rise to innumerable names upon this head. My old pupil, Mr.\r\nClement Cadle, says:—\r\n\r\n     It is almost impossible to give satisfactory information on the\r\n     sorts of fruit, because the same sort is not only known by\r\n     different names in different localities, but it also assumes a\r\n     widely different character under the influence of broad\r\n     distinctions of soil and climate, and this is more frequently the\r\n     case with pears than apples. In a tour I made last autumn in the\r\n     south of Devonshire, I visited several farms in the neighbourhood\r\n     of Totnes and Paignton, and amongst a great number of sorts that I\r\n     there saw, I could in no instance recognize either an apple or tree\r\n     as being like those I had seen before in Herefordshire,\r\n     Gloucestershire, or Worcestershire.\r\n\r\n     In selecting for producing cider or perry it is very important, not\r\n     only to get those kinds which suit the district, but to get a\r\n     variety in their character, especially for making good cider. Thus,\r\n     some of the apples should be sour, others sweet, bitter-sweet,\r\n     tart, and harsh, as much of the keeping character of the cider\r\n     depends upon this mixture, which also makes it fine down well. It\r\n     may be remarked that sweet or eating sorts of pears seldom make\r\n     perry that will keep any length of time, or that fines well.\r\n\r\n     There is another peculiar feature in regard to sorts of fruit,\r\n     namely, that each variety has its day, then gradually dies out. The\r\n     trees become non-bearers, and their places are filled with new\r\n     sorts. This is especially the case with the Hagloe crab, Fox whelp,\r\n     and Skryme’s kernel, which seldom bear or grow well now, and are\r\n     nearly gone.\r\n\r\n     _R. A. S. Journal S.S._, vol. I. pp. 18, 19.\r\n\r\nAs regards pears, it should be stated that, while in Worcester,\r\nGloucester, and Hereford much perry is made, and it is highly esteemed,\r\nespecially for bottling, in Dorset this drink is almost unknown, and we\r\nwere last year greatly surprised that a farmer who had an immense crop\r\nof pears of a sort that were not fit for dessert or culinary purposes,\r\ncould not divine what to do with them, though he made excellent cider.\r\n\r\nWe conclude this portion of our subject with a quotation from the\r\nBotanical Looker-out, by our old friend and fellow worker, E. Lees,\r\nEsq.:—\r\n\r\n     A pear orchard in exuberant flower is a vegetable spectacle not\r\n     easily matched, for the bending branches of the pear tree give a\r\n     gracefulness to its outline far exceeding the stiff formality of\r\n     the apple tree, and oppressed with a multitudinous crowd of\r\n     blossoms its branches almost trail the ground, a bending load of\r\n     beauty that seems by moonlight a mass of silvery ingots. The\r\n     Barland Orchard, between Worcester and Malvern, containing more\r\n     than seventy trees, lofty as oaks, cannot be seen by a traveller\r\n     without admiration, and is the finest in the kingdom, though the\r\n     trees are now getting old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nON THE PRODUCTION AND CHOICE OF FRUIT TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough new sorts of fruits are easily obtainable from seeds, yet this\r\nmethod of production is much too slow for general purposes, and when\r\nkernel trees—that is those raised from seed—are in the slow progress of\r\nsuch events brought to produce fruit, it is ten to one if it be of any\r\nvalue; so that even seedling trees, when they have attained sufficient\r\nsize, are best used for stocks upon which to graft any desired sort.\r\n\r\nIn reproducing a constant supply of well-known sorts of fruit, three\r\nplans are usually practised, namely, _Budding_, _Grafting_, and\r\n_Cutting_.\r\n\r\n_Budding_ is usually employed in the case of smaller fruit or flower\r\ntrees, and but seldom with apples and pears; this well-known process,\r\nhowever, is frequently had recourse to in the nursery; it is performed\r\nfor fruit trees in the same way as for roses, and therefore needs no\r\ndescription in this place, as we can scarcely conceive the farmer doing\r\nmuch in this direction, except as a matter of amusement and experiment.\r\n\r\n_Grafting_ is a common process on most farms with orcharding; a sort of\r\nfruit may be wished to be changed or a promising tree may be broken, and\r\nin either case the farmer should know enough of the process of grafting\r\nto be able to do it himself or else to properly direct others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n1. The Graft.\r\n\r\n2. The Stock.]\r\n\r\nIn grafting, the first thing to be done is to secure good shoots from a\r\nhealthy tree of the sort you wish to grow—these are called the “grafts.”\r\nThe stem to receive the graft is called the stock. Now a stock may be\r\nsingle, in which case one graft will be sufficient, as in the\r\naccompanying diagram, or if an old tree has to be grafted, a graft may\r\nbe inserted on as many branches as may seem desirable. Our diagram\r\nrepresents the common practice of side grafting, but different plans are\r\nadopted according to the difference in size of the stock on the one\r\nhand, and the graft on the other, the principle to be aimed at in the\r\nprocess being to get _as complete an apposition of as much of the wood\r\nand bark of the graft, with that of the stock, as is possible by careful\r\ncutting and fitting_, and the tact and delicacy in manipulating this\r\nmatter make that successful result which marks the good grafter. In this\r\nas in other matters, practice and experience ensure success; and hence\r\nit is usually found expedient to employ a person who makes it his\r\nprofession, and such are always to be obtained in cider countries.\r\n\r\nWhen the grafts have been fitted, they must be kept in place by some\r\nplastic material, and that most commonly used is a compost of cow-dung\r\nand clay, well kneaded together, or merely chopped hay and clay; this is\r\npressed round the united parts in the form of a ball, and in cases\r\nwhere every care is taken the graft may be further protected by a wicker\r\nbasket, as in the diagram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Graft protected by a Wicker basket.]\r\n\r\n_Cutting._—The ease with which apple trees can be multiplied by cuttings\r\nwas forcibly impressed upon our attention at a very early age. When a\r\nboy, having seen a most promising branch cut from a favourite apple tree\r\nin the process of pruning, the thought struck us that we might get a\r\ntree of our own, and so, seizing the branch in question, we planted it\r\nin another part of the garden, only—sad to relate—to have it pulled up\r\nthe first time the gardener passed that way. With a boy’s perseverance\r\nor obstinacy—which the reader pleases—again and again did we replant\r\nthis same branch with a like result, until finding a quiet corner, we\r\nonce more planted our cutting, and this time, no evil chance overtaking\r\nit, it took root; and in two years from that time we enjoyed the taste\r\nof apples from what, we hope not undeservedly, was allowed to be\r\nconsidered our own tree. This was a matter for frequent reflection in\r\nafter-life, for, besides viewing the result as a reward for\r\nperseverance, it is just possible that our first disappointment may have\r\ntended after all to our success, for doubtless the unexposed sheltered\r\ncorner was just the place for ensuring this in rooting cuttings. Here,\r\nhowever, the cutting was a large branch, but for general purposes we\r\nshould recommend cuttings to be made of small unbranched shoots; these\r\nmay be planted in rows in a somewhat shaded situation, and when they\r\nhave become rooted and fit for independent trees, they may be removed to\r\ntheir permanent places, and so be either pruned for tall orchard trees,\r\nor, as they are well adapted to the purpose, be trained for dwarf\r\norchards.\r\n\r\n_Pruning_, in the cultivation and due keeping of an orchard, is one of\r\nthe most important operations connected with the subject. Its objects\r\nare:—\r\n\r\n1st. To circumscribe the growth in any given direction, to train the\r\ntree on the one hand, and to let in light and air by thinning on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n2nd. By pruning fruit trees we operate so as to check undue growth of\r\nwood and leaf, and thus, by what the botanist calls the “arrestation of\r\ndevelopment,” cause flower and fruit to be formed instead of leaves. In\r\nthe western counties, if a tree or plant of any kind grows leaves too\r\nfreely, it is said to be too “frum,” probably derived from the Saxon\r\n_from_, strong, stout.\r\n\r\nPruning, then, hastens the fruiting season in fruit trees, but at the\r\nsame time it brings on premature age, and hence the operation should be\r\nperformed with judgment, or else premature decay will be the\r\nconsequence. In pruning of large trees care should be taken to cut out,\r\nas smoothly as possible, all awkward or crossing branches, so as to\r\nexpose the whole of the fruiting limbs to light, warmth, and air. This\r\nagain is an operation requiring an experienced hand, and when such an\r\none is known, it is far better to employ him than to trust the matter\r\nto those who know little or nothing of the subject.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said and written upon the subject of rearing fruit trees,\r\nand when matter of this kind is addressed to the nurseryman, it is to be\r\nwelcomed if based upon sound botanical principles, but we cannot\r\nrecommend the farmer to grow his own fruit trees, as he rarely pays\r\nsufficient attention to their youthful training, and we therefore\r\nrecommend the purchase of fruit trees from the best growers, to get the\r\nbest sorts, and to get well-grown and healthy examples. These should be\r\ncarefully lifted and planted as soon as possible after leaving the\r\nnursery, always avoiding trees that have hawked the market week after\r\nweek, even if procurable for nothing.\r\n\r\nSome people insist upon the propriety of planting poor trees grown in\r\npoor soil, but our experience has shown that nothing could be a greater\r\nmistake. It is true that these often fruit soon; but getting crops of\r\nfruit from trees only a quarter grown, though sometimes welcome to a\r\ntenant with no sure holding, is a matter which should always be looked\r\nto by the landlord, who, indeed, should pay greater attention to his\r\norchards than is usually the case, if his desire be to hand them down to\r\nhis successors in anything like a good bearing condition. That fruit\r\ntrees must in time get old is quite true; at the same time it may be\r\nstated as an important fact, that poor stunted trees on the one hand, or\r\nthose too prodigal of their youth on the other, will too surely result\r\nin decrepitude ere half the span of a healthy tree be attained.\r\n\r\nFeeling so strongly as we do the importance of healthy young trees from\r\na good soil and climate to plant even in an unfavourable district,\r\ninstead of, as is generally sought after, trees from a poor soil, we are\r\nglad to have our opinion fortified by a successful practical grower of\r\nfruit trees, whose samples of young stock in apple trees, as we have\r\nseen them exhibited in Yeovil market, are patterns of healthiness in\r\nbark and models of form. The cultivator to whom we refer is Mr. J.\r\nScott, whose name and place we have before mentioned. He says, in his\r\nDescriptive Catalogue of Fruit Trees:—\r\n\r\n     There remains _one thing_ the writer would especially guard\r\n     intending planters against; that is, be careful _never to purchase_\r\n     trees off a poor soil. I know this is heterodox; but many years’\r\n     experience has taught me the fallacy of the popular dogma, _i.e._,\r\n     “Get your trees off poor soils, as they will be hardier, and endure\r\n     the storms better.” I could show examples, in numbers, in my\r\n     nursery, where the trees came from one of the so-called poor soils,\r\n     that never will be anything like healthy trees. They were\r\n     hide-bound and checked in their natures when I received them, and I\r\n     believe will ever remain so, less or more. A genial, moderately\r\n     rich, and naturally good soil is the soil I would choose my trees\r\n     from.\r\n\r\nExperience and observation, both in the garden and the orchard, fully\r\nconfirm us in this view of the case, and we would therefore only add to\r\nthe direction, “Get your trees from moderately rich soil,” that of,\r\n“Plant them in a soil of the like kind;” for if trees be brought from a\r\npoor soil, not fit for them, to a poorer, they will certainly not\r\nsucceed, and indeed the choice of poor land for orchard growth will be\r\nseen to end in disappointment.\r\n\r\nIn planting apples we should choose a mixture of several of the best\r\nsorts, and it is recommended that some should be sour; but we prefer to\r\nhave those that produce a juice of high specific gravity, though with\r\nall cider and perry fruit there will be great diversities in this\r\nrespect, depending upon soil, climate, and season.\r\n\r\nThe following list of apples contains such as are met with principally\r\nin the counties of Worcester, Hereford, and Gloucester; all may be used\r\nfor cider, but some are more especially adapted for house purposes:—\r\n\r\nI.—LIST OF APPLES.\r\n\r\n  Those marked with (A) are good for hoarding, and those with † are good\r\n  for boiling.\r\n\r\n   Skyrme’s Kernel—Tart; good for cider.\r\n   Royal Wilding—Bitter sweet; good for cider.\r\n   Black Foxwhelp—Moderately tart; good for cider.\r\n  †Red Foxwhelp (A)—Moderately tart; good for cider.\r\n   Cowan Red—Sweet; good for cider.\r\n  †Dymock Red (A)—Very sweet; good for cider.\r\n   White Norman—Bitter sweet; good for cider.\r\n   Red Norman—Bitter sweet; good for cider.\r\n   Hagloe Crab—Tart; good for cider.\r\n   Pawson—Tart; good for cider.\r\n  †Redstreak—Sweet; good for cider.\r\n   Yellow Styre—Sweet; good for cider.\r\n  †Hooper’s Kernel (A)—Moderately sweet; good for cider.\r\n  †Hill Barn Kernel (A)—Sweet; good for cider.\r\n  †Ribston Pippin (A)—Sweet; good for table and keeping.\r\n   Golden Harvey (A)—Sweet; good for table and for cider.\r\n   Siberian Harvey—Sweet; good for cider.\r\n   Farewell Blossom—Tart and bitter; large bearer.\r\n   Upright French—Bitter sweet; large bearer.\r\n   Black or Red French—Bitter sweet.\r\n   Knotted Kernel—Tart.\r\n   Leather Apple—Hardly any taste.\r\n   Ironsides (A)—Hardly any taste; good for keeping.\r\n  †Cats’-heads (A)—Sweet; good for cider.\r\n   Pigs’-eyes—Sweet.\r\n   Downton Pippin (A)—Sweet; table and eating.\r\n  †Codlings (A)—Sweet; good as boilers and for cider.\r\n  †May Blooms (A)—Sweet; good for cider, boiling, and keeping.\r\n   Rough Coat (A)—Dry and sweet; good keepers.\r\n   Brandy Apple (A)—Very sweet; makes strong cider.\r\n  †Cowarne Quinin (A) Sweet; good for cider.\r\n  †Blenheim Orange (A)—Very sweet; good for table.\r\n  †Golden Pippin (A)—Very sweet; good for table.\r\n   Old Pearmain (A)—Very sweet; good for table.\r\n   Brown Crests—Very sweet.\r\n   Under Leaves—Sweet; large bearer.\r\n   Red Kernel—Sweet; good for cider.\r\n  †Reynolds’s Kernel (A)—Sweet; large pot-fruit.\r\n   Newland Kernel—Bitter sweet; good for cider.\r\n   Jackson’s Kernel—Tart.\r\n  †Sam’s Crab—Tart.\r\n  †Bridgewater Pippin (A)—Sweet.\r\n  †Spice Apple (A)—Sweet.\r\n   White Beach—Bitter sweet; good for cider.\r\n   Handsome Mandy—Bitter sweet; good for cider.\r\n   Golden Rennet (A)—Sweet.\r\n   Pine Apple—Moderately tart; wood cankers.\r\n   Stoke Pippin (A)—Sweet; good bearers; pot-fruit and for cider; and\r\n   numerous others.\r\n\r\n  _From Prize Essay on Orchards, by Clement Cadle, from the Journal of\r\n  the Royal Society._\r\n\r\nThe next list is taken from Scott’s Descriptive Catalogue, by way of\r\ncontrast and comparison with the above, as it is more particularly\r\nadapted to Devon, Somerset, and Dorset.\r\n\r\nLIST II. CIDER APPLES.\r\n\r\n  The following is a list of some of the best Cider fruit, cultivated in\r\n  the best Cider counties throughout England.\r\n\r\n  167. Best Bache, spec. grav. 1073. A Herefordshire fruit of great\r\n       excellence.\r\n  168. Bringewood, a good cider fruit.\r\n  169. Bovey Redstreak.\r\n  170. Cadbury, supposed to be the same as Royal Somerset.\r\n  171. Coccagee, a splendid cider fruit of first-rate excellence.\r\n  172. Cowrane, red, spec. grav. 1069; an excellent sort.\r\n  173. Devonshire Redstreak.\r\n   37. Devonshire Quarrenden, a valuable hardy fruit; well known.\r\n   35. Downton Pippin, a most prolific and valuable cider fruit.\r\n  174. Forest Styre, spec. grav. 1076 to 1081, esteemed fruit.\r\n  175. Foxley, spec. grav. 1080, hardy and a great bearer, excellent\r\n       cider fruit.\r\n  176. Fox Whelp, spec. grav. 1076 to 1080, a celebrated cider fruit of\r\n       the richest kind.\r\n   54. Golden Harvey, spec. grav. 1085, a first-rate cider fruit. No\r\n       orchard should be without this.\r\n  177. Haglo Crab, spec. grav. 1081.\r\n  178. Jersey, early, very fine cider fruit.\r\n  179.

Kingston Black, first-rate cider fruit of first-rate excellence.\r\n   97. Minchal Crab, a very fine fruit.\r\n  181. Red Must, very large, yielding a fine cider from heavy soils.\r\n  182. Red Streak, spec. grav. 1079, one of the best cider apples.\r\n  183. Siberian Bitter Sweet, spec. grav. 1091.\r\n  184. Sops in Wine.\r\n  185. Tom Potter or Tom Put, a fine fruit.\r\n\r\n  Besides the above, many other choice sorts make splendid Cider.\r\n\r\nPears for perry differ in one respect from apples, in that, though the\r\nbest and purest perry is made from only one sort of fruit, and that\r\ngenerally from fruit utterly unfit for any other purpose. Pears, as has\r\nbeen stated, delight in a lighter soil than that which is suitable for\r\napples, and the trees have the advantage of growing so tall that even\r\ncereal cultivation is possible under them. It is, therefore, curious to\r\nnote how scarcely any perry pears are grown in the west of England,\r\nunless we view Gloucester as a western county. Though Somerset and\r\nDorset are particularly adapted for the pear, there are many places\r\nwhere its culture is never attempted; we would mention the district of\r\nsandy loam around Sherborne, Dorset, as one well adapted for the growth\r\nof perry, but where it is nevertheless almost unknown.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that although good cider—even the best—can be made from\r\ndessert and culinary fruit, yet dessert pears are not well adapted for\r\nperry, as their produce is usually watery, and does not fine well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nON FRUIT-GATHERING, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn making cider and perry there are several important matters to be\r\ntaken into consideration, as upon the due observance of these success\r\nwill mainly depend. These are—\r\n\r\nThe selection, gathering, and storing of the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe grinding of the fruit, and storage of the drink.\r\n\r\nThe after-management, keeping, fining, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nOrchard fruit is economized chiefly in the three following methods:—\r\n\r\n     1. Cooking Apples—used for culinary purposes.\r\n\r\n     2. Dessert Apples—some of the fine-flavoured varieties.\r\n\r\n     3. Cider Fruit—which includes all the others.\r\n\r\n1. Cooking apples may be hand-picked as they become ripe, and those that\r\nwill not keep long, as the various codlins, may be disposed of in the\r\nlump to the fruiterer, or sent to market in smaller quantities. The good\r\nkeeping apples may be sold in the lot when ripe, or kept in store to be\r\nretailed at market.\r\n\r\nBoth these sets of apples require to be gathered with some care; in\r\nshort, to be what are called “hand-picked,” as, when bruised, they not\r\nonly are injured for present use, but their keeping qualities are\r\ngreatly affected.\r\n\r\nFor store apples the fruit should be gathered before being what is\r\ncalled “dead ripe,” that is, when they are quite crisp and juicy; one of\r\nthe best indications of fitness being a bright light-brown kernel as\r\nopposed to a dull dark-brown.\r\n\r\nThe fruit should be kept in a dry room, from which frost is entirely\r\nexcluded, and where air can freely ventilate whenever required. The best\r\nplan is to fit up such a room with shelves made up of laths three inches\r\nwide, and placed an inch and a half or two inches apart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF SHELF FOR KEEPING FRUIT.]\r\n\r\nIn this way _a_ represents the laths, of which there may be many or few\r\nto each shelf according to the breadth required; _b_, the interspaces.\r\nHere, then, the fruit is placed in lines over the interspaces, the\r\nobject being thus to secure a free passage for the air all around the\r\nfruit; if placed in a single layer, faulty ones can be seen at a glance,\r\nand these should be removed as soon as detected.\r\n\r\nIf this plan be found too onerous, and fruit must be put together in\r\nlarger quantity, we would advise that they be so placed as that air can\r\nget to them from below. Keeping fruit in heaps in corners, or even\r\nspreading them between layers of straw, tends to their destruction\r\nrather than preservation. If, then, it be borne in mind that the end to\r\naim at, in order to keep fruit, is that of exposing sound examples to\r\nthe free access of the air, it will be seen that the nearer we can\r\nsecure this the better will be our result.\r\n\r\nWe say _sound_ fruit, for it is useless to put spotted and worm-eaten\r\napples or pears in the keeping-room. These had better be put by and used\r\nas soon as possible for whatever purpose they may be fit, for whenever\r\nthe air can get into the interior of fruit by reason of abrasions,\r\nborings, &c., decay soon sets in; and now, while we are writing, we have\r\na quantity of apples with the plague-spot of rottenness proceeding from\r\ntheir being “worm-eaten.”\r\n\r\n2. In storing dessert apples these directions are even more important.\r\nIf, then, the farm should produce one or several sorts in quantity, if\r\nthey are to be disposed of, we would advise their sale to the fruiterer\r\nwith the onus of gathering and managing them. Small farmers sometimes\r\nmake no bad addition to their income by thus disposing of fine fruits,\r\nand we always advise that such should be planted to a greater extent\r\nthan is usually done about farm homesteads. It is not a heavy matter for\r\nthe landlord to find a few sorts of choice fruit-trees for his smaller\r\nor even larger holdings, and, by thus adding to the comfort or even\r\nluxuries of his tenants, he will be benefiting not only himself but the\r\ncountry at large. We believe it to be a duty incumbent upon the landed\r\nproprietor thus to foster a love of fruits, and we honour the names of\r\nKnight, of Downton, and Williams, of Pitmaston, in that they loved to\r\npropagate new fruits, and to encourage their dissemination. It is said\r\nby Mr. Benjamin Maund, the author of “The Fruitist”:—\r\n\r\n     A propagator of apple and pear trees from seeds may be supposed to\r\n     possess not only patience, but a desire to benefit posterity.\r\n     Twelve or fourteen years cast a long shadow before them; and when,\r\n     after waiting this length of time, the uncertain value of the\r\n     substance is considered, it must be confessed that men deserve more\r\n     than praise, who originate new fruits. Apple trees rarely show the\r\n     real quality of their fruit in less than fourteen years. All,\r\n     however, who have the convenience of doing so, should raise\r\n     seedling trees; for it is to these only that we can look with any\r\n     degree of confidence for permanently furnishing our orchards, and\r\n     not to old or cankering varieties.\r\n\r\nIt is true that it is not within the province of all, even of the\r\npermanent owners of the soil, thus to add to the number of Pomona’s\r\ngifts, but all can inquire for and purchase esteemed sorts; and no\r\ntenant that is worth having will grudge them care and attention, be his\r\ntenure ever so precarious.\r\n\r\nWe would assign to the lords of the soil the duty of improving\r\nfruit-trees, while the gentleman who resides in the country, it may be\r\nfor only a short season, should make the best use of it to encourage a\r\nlove for the garden, and to increase its various attractions to charm\r\nthe eye, and to increase and vary the vegetable food of the people.\r\n\r\n3. Fruit for cider-making will consist of “wind-falls,” that is, such as\r\nhas fallen prematurely ripe, or been shaken off by the wind; and\r\ngathered fruit. As regards wind-falls, it is only necessary to state\r\nthat, although these can only be employed for an inferior kind of drink,\r\nyet even this may be improved by care, as thus:—Instead of picking up\r\nthe apples while they are still wet with dew, they should be gathered in\r\nas dry a state as possible, and then not, as is too often the case,\r\nhuddled together in a heap in the orchard, exposed to alternations of\r\nfrost, and wet, and dry.\r\n\r\nSuch fruit will often require to be kept for some time waiting temperate\r\nweather, which is best for cider-making. It should be kept then under\r\ncover, and in such a manner that the air can get beneath it; and for\r\nthis purpose we have found a few wattled hurdles well adapted for\r\nkeeping fruit on that is waiting to be ground.\r\n\r\nIn gathering cider-fruit we should consider it ripe at that period when\r\na not rude shake of a limb would cause most of it to fall pretty well at\r\none and the same time. We dislike beating off fruit with sticks, as it\r\ndamages the bearing shoots. In fine, in gathering fruit all undue\r\nviolence should be carefully avoided, as it is unwise to use that amount\r\nof hurry, which will only secure a large present crop, unless it can be\r\ndone in such a manner as not to injure our hopes of the future. It is a\r\ncurious circumstance that in the garden there is usually something like\r\na crop, even in a bad season; but in the orchard we seldom meet with\r\nanything like a crop the year following what is called a “hit of fruit,”\r\nand only the finer sorts of apples which are hand-gathered with care are\r\noften found to be most constant bearers, while the rougher cider-fruits\r\nseldom afford a good crop oftener than once in from three to five years.\r\nSurely, then, much of this must be the result of the rougher treatment\r\nto which cider-fruit is so carelessly subjected.\r\n\r\nWhen the fruit is collected, it should be put in a dry airy place, to\r\nawait the process of grinding. For this we adopt the plan of spreading\r\nit in sheds or outhouses on wattled hurdles. This keeps it from the\r\nrain, by which it becomes sodden when in exposed heaps: then the wind\r\nwill only partially dry it, and the result will be a general heating of\r\nthe mass, which results, if not in quick decay amounting to absolute\r\nrottenness, yet in that state, technically called “moisey,”[31] or dead,\r\nin which the juices are nearly dried up and the fruit flavourless.\r\n\r\n[31] Apple moise, or apple moce, was an old dish made of pressed apples.\r\nIn cider counties apples are called moisey when they are juiceless, dry,\r\nand without flavour—dead. (See Archaic Dictionaries.)\r\n\r\nWe have seen heaps of apples, consisting of many waggon-loads, in the\r\norchard at Christmas, when wet and frost had so preyed upon them that\r\nnone of their proper juices remained. This is certain to make a cider\r\nwhich will be of inferior quality; and though some of our friends boast\r\nof the good quality of their cider which has been made in the roughest\r\nmanner, yet one cannot help thinking how much better it might have been\r\nwith the fruit carefully collected, and kept until it could be ground.\r\nStill, with all our care in this matter, disappointment is sometimes the\r\nresult; for it is with cider as with wine, the season will have a great\r\ndeal to do with it, though with both, the manner of making and storing\r\nwill be all-important matters, to which we shall advert in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nWe much object to the gathering of fruit for any purpose in the wet.\r\nWere it not for the expense, it would be better to take advantage of dry\r\nweather, and to collect even cider-fruit by hand-picking before it has\r\nbecome dead ripe, and so let the ripening process be completed in some\r\ndry storing-place. In our own experience of cider-making, the two or\r\nthree casks made for home consumption from carefully picked and\r\nwell-kept fruit are usually of the best quality, and so made we believe\r\ncider to be a most agreeable and very wholesome beverage,—to paraphrase\r\nIsaac Walton, only fit for farmers or very honest men. As long, however,\r\nas rough people are about who never know when they have had enough, the\r\nrougher cider made by a ruder process is quite good enough.\r\n\r\nIt must be obvious to all that if a man can drink as much as four\r\ngallons of good cider in a day’s mowing, he would be better off with a\r\nless quantity of an inferior sort, supplemented with tea or coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nON CIDER-MAKING AND ITS MANAGEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn making cider or perry it is well not to begin unless the weather be\r\nmoderately cool, as in hot weather the changes in the fluid become too\r\nrapid, and it consequently does not keep well.\r\n\r\nThe first process will be to grind the fruit into as perfect a state of\r\npulp as possible. This will be effected when the kernels are decidedly\r\ncrushed. Such a state of pulp usually ensures the best results, not only\r\nfrom the fact that the whole juice of the fruit is not only set free,\r\nbut it is all exposed to the action of the air, by which both the colour\r\nand quality are greatly improved; and, besides this, every good quality\r\nis decidedly increased by having the principles and flavour of the\r\nkernels mixed with the other juices.\r\n\r\nThe method by which this is best effected is by grinding in the usual\r\ncircular stone horse-mill. This is confessedly a slow process, but\r\nnotwithstanding the newer methods, to be presently described, we still\r\nprefer it to all others, and that from the great completeness with which\r\nthe grinding is effected.\r\n\r\nOf late years cider-mills have been brought out which essentially\r\nconsist of a combination of gribbling teeth, by which the fruit is first\r\ntorn to pieces, and two cylindrical rollers, between which it is\r\nafterwards crushed with greater or less completeness.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the rollers are of iron, in others of hard stone: the\r\nlatter is preferable, as contact with iron, even where but slight,\r\ncauses the drink to assume a degree of blackness, especially on\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\nPortable mills of this kind are now very general, but we so fully agree\r\nwith the remarks of Mr. Cadle, that we here quote his description of\r\nsome portable cider-mills, with his comments upon their action.\r\n\r\n     About twenty-six years ago, Mr. Coleman, of Chaxhill,\r\n     Westbury-on-Severn, commenced making an improved cider-mill and\r\n     press, which could act either as a fixture or a portable mill. It\r\n     was found that the cider thus made fined better, and the process\r\n     was also more expeditious. These advantages, together with the cost\r\n     of keeping the old kind of mills in repair, which landlords were\r\n     unwilling to undertake, led to their being superseded, as they wore\r\n     out, by Coleman’s, or a similar mill.\r\n\r\n     Coleman’s mill consists of two pairs of rollers fixed in a strong\r\n     wooden frame; it is fed from a hopper, the apples passing through\r\n     the first pair of rollers, which are made of hard wood, with iron\r\n     teeth, so as to break the apples, which fall next between a pair of\r\n     stone rollers set close enough to break the kernels, and from these\r\n     the pulp drops into a trough placed beneath to receive it.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Latchem, of Hereford, has also paid considerable attention to\r\n     the construction of these mills, and has taken out a patent for\r\n     doing away with the iron in the feed-rollers, and substituting\r\n     steel teeth fitted into one roller, and working through other steel\r\n     teeth on a fixed plate, partly on the same principle as a\r\n     curd-mill. The fruit, after passing this “chewer,” is ground\r\n     between a pair of stone rollers, as before described.\r\n\r\n     Until the portable apple-mills became general, we had a mill to\r\n     almost every farm, and even to many of the cottages; but in\r\n     Devonshire one mill or pound-house serves for a number of makers,\r\n     and sometimes for a parish, each person paying so much per hogshead\r\n     for the making.\r\n\r\n     Most of the travelling portable machines in Herefordshire have two\r\n     presses with each mill, and are worked by two horses, making 1,000\r\n     to 1,500 gallons in a day; sometimes they are worked by a small\r\n     portable steam-engine. They are very expeditious, and do very well\r\n     for a second-class cider, but if you would have the best, they are\r\n     very objectionable, because the different sorts of fruit very\r\n     rarely get ripe at once in sufficient quantities to enable you to\r\n     make much at a time. Much cider is therefore spoiled, the fruit\r\n     being ground when too green, by those who are impatient to finish\r\n     the process. I think that each farm or holding should have a mill\r\n     of its own, even if it be only a small hand-mill.\r\n\r\n     There are several other rude plans of grinding, such as nut-mills,\r\n     graters, scratchers, &c., but they are so objectionable that they\r\n     hardly deserve notice.\r\n\r\n     All metallic substances should be kept from contact with the pulp,\r\n     as chemical combinations immediately take place on contact; for\r\n     instance, if you take a clean knife and cut an apple through, the\r\n     knife quickly becomes black, as well as the apple. For this reason\r\n     I think the iron teeth and cast-iron in the rollers are\r\n     objectionable; as also the steel ones, although perhaps not to the\r\n     same extent. I should recommend that this iron be removed, and\r\n     fluted rollers of larger diameter be made of some hard wood, such\r\n     as yew-tree, or American iron-wood. No doubt more power would then\r\n     be required to work the mills, but this would be of little\r\n     consequence if the produce was first-class cider.\r\n\r\n     When this new mode of grinding was first tried, there was great\r\n     complaint amongst the labourers that the cider did not agree with\r\n     them, and this was generally attributed to the iron; but in my\r\n     opinion, the green state of the fruit when ground made the juice\r\n     harsh, and caused irritation in the system.—_Journal R. A. S._,\r\n     vol. XXV. page 1.\r\n\r\nThe next point for consideration is the pressing out of the juice. This\r\nhas been done with screw-presses of various kinds, either wood or iron,\r\nwith single or double screws.\r\n\r\nHydraulic presses are now coming into fashion, and one advantage which\r\nthey possess is, that of easily and expeditiously getting _all_ the\r\njuice from the pulp.\r\n\r\nIn Dorsetshire the ground pulp or “pummy” is usually put upon a flat\r\nstage between layers of straw, which are deftly turned up at the edges\r\nso as to keep the “cheese” together. Upon the top of the cheese is\r\nplaced another flat board, which is acted upon by the press.\r\n\r\nIn Worcestershire and Hereford the pulp is pressed in hair cloths, which\r\nplan is much more perfect than with straw.\r\n\r\nIn pressing it is well to observe that the pulp be ground on one day and\r\npressed the next, as not only colour but general richness in quality\r\nresults from exposure. The dark colour which an apple assumes on being\r\ncut is due to this cause, not as supposed to the steel knife, for the\r\nchange mentioned is equally certain with a silver one. In the now almost\r\nexploded plan of scooping apples, the pulp of even sour apples becomes\r\nsweet by the process.\r\n\r\nAs the juice is exuded from the press it falls into a trough beneath,\r\nwhich is divided into two parts by a grating with small holes, by which\r\nthe particles of pulp are separated, and from this the clearer fluid is\r\nconveyed to the cask.\r\n\r\nAs regards straining, we have seen some of the finer sorts of perry made\r\nby a more complete straining than the above; in fact, a rough kind of\r\nfiltering in flannel bags. This would take too long a time for general\r\npurposes. It is, however, a good way of making drink for bottling.\r\n\r\nThe after-management of cider and perry is a subject upon which much has\r\nbeen both said and written. We, however, join in the country opinion,\r\nthat “if it be made well the less it is messed with the better.”\r\n\r\nWe prefer putting cider in large casks in a cool cellar—say of from one\r\nto two hundred gallons or more,—to each of which should be two\r\ntap-holes, one in the middle and one towards the bottom; the first\r\ntapping from the middle hole insures a clear fluid without disturbing\r\nthe lower part, which thus goes on “settling down.”\r\n\r\nIf cider from good fruit be made well, it will have an agreeable\r\nsub-acid flavour, derived from the malic acid, which is the principle\r\nwhich gives the refreshing juice of most fruits.\r\n\r\nFermentation is necessary to make good cider, as by it the sugar of the\r\nfruit is converted into alcohol or spirit; and if, when this process is\r\ncomplete, the fermentation ceases, we shall have a refreshing, exciting,\r\nand generous fluid; if, however, it passes from vinous to acetous\r\nfermentation, we get acetic acid, and the product is sour.\r\n\r\nCider made from good and well-ordered fruit in temperate weather, and\r\nput in casks in a cool cellar, will be likely to ferment equably, and to\r\nstop at the right time; if so, the product will be of the best; if,\r\nhowever, these conditions have not been complied with, the cider will be\r\nmore or less harsh or “hard,” and no means will avail to improve it.\r\nSulphur may be burnt in the casks to check fermentation; but we would\r\nafter all prefer acetic to sulphurous acid. Chalk and lime will\r\ndecompose the acid, but to little purpose. The London method of adding\r\nsugar or sugar-candy and water to sour cider—and to them all mature\r\ncider is sour—is in itself innocent enough.\r\n\r\nThere is, then, this consolation: if the cider be harsh, farm labourers\r\nwill drink it; and as they will not, as a rule, drink half so much of\r\nthe inferior as of the best, they will after all be the gainers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nON THE USES AND ECONOMY OF CIDER AND PERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we canvass the opinions of the mass of the people in cider-producing\r\nand non-cider-producing counties as to the relative merits of cider and\r\nbeer, we shall find opinions wider apart than even the counties\r\nthemselves. The “Beer-drinking Briton” cannot at all understand how the\r\nlover of cider can skin his throat with such sour stuff as cider, whilst\r\nthe agricultural labourer in cider districts infinitely prefers harsh\r\ncider to the finest ale. We recollect, in one of our geological trips in\r\nto Herefordshire, in company with an esteemed clerical friend, that a\r\nquarryman, working in Wenlock limestone, tendered us a few shells, on\r\nwhich we offered him sixpence, remarking, “Here’s a quart of beer for\r\nyour trouble.” This same man then gave our companion a couple of\r\ntrilobites, who presented him with a coin of like value to our own, but\r\nwith the remark, “Here, my friend, is a _gallon of cider_ for you.” The\r\neffect upon the man’s whole being will never be forgotten. He was the\r\nslave of the Church for the whole day, and ever thereafter for all we\r\ncan tell.\r\n\r\nIn cider districts the farmer, his family and friends, all relish cider,\r\nand with all, its proper use seems to agree in a most remarkable manner;\r\nbut it would be fun to a country cousin who could cease to look at the\r\nmatter in a serious light to see what a face his London relative would\r\nmake at a draught of his “own peculiar;” and yet he of the town\r\nprofesses to like sweet cider; but as his knowledge of sweet cider is\r\nobtained from the summer drink of the London houses, called “Prime\r\nDevonshire Cider,” the following recipe will explain it:—\r\n\r\n  Take of Vinegar (or sweeter still, cider)  1 pint.\r\n          Brown sugar (or treacle)           1 pound.\r\n          Water                              7 quarts.\r\n\r\nThe following will be found in Cooley’s “Cyclopædia of Practical\r\nReceipts:”—\r\n\r\n     CIDER, MADE.—An article under this name is made in Devonshire for\r\n     the supply of the London market, it having been found that the\r\n     ordinary cider will not stand a voyage to the metropolis without\r\n     some preparation. The finest quality of made cider is only ordinary\r\n     cider racked into a clean cask, and well sulphured; but the mass of\r\n     that which is sent to London is mixed with water, treacle, and\r\n     alum, and then fined down, after which it is racked into\r\n     well-matched casks (_i.e._, a burnt-sulphur match). The larger\r\n     portion of the cider sold in London, professing to be Devonshire\r\n     cider, would be rejected even by the farmers’ servants in that\r\n     county.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, then, that cider is not a favourite beverage when it is only\r\nused as a summer drink in some sophisticated form; but, when understood\r\nand obtained at all good, we believe it to be wholesome and palatable,\r\nand, indeed, we know it to be preferred before even the best ales in\r\ncider districts.\r\n\r\nThere is a common error amongst town-folk who prefer the above mixture\r\nthat cider is not intoxicating, that it has no strength in it; but we\r\nregret to say that it is not only intoxicating, but we believe more\r\nexciting than beer: it is true that its effects pass off sooner.\r\n\r\nDrunkenness with cider would seem to be so far different than in the\r\ncase of beer, in that while the latter makes its victim heavy and\r\nstupid, the former incites to motion, and leads to quarrelling,\r\nfighting, and foolhardiness.\r\n\r\nHence, then, cider so exhilarates the farm labourer that he will do any\r\namount of work if he is constantly plied with it, and all the while that\r\nit is but stimulating him, he fancies he is getting strength and vigour\r\nfrom it; but, alas! he is only thus drawing upon his capital; exhaustion\r\nfollows a hard day’s work got over amid hard drinking, which requires\r\nthe following day to be spent on the same high-pressure system, or else\r\nlittle will be done. Hence one of our own labourers, during barley\r\nmowing at so much _per acre_, was fain to confess that he “wanted a pint\r\nof cider at four o’clock in the morning worse nor any other time of\r\nday.”\r\n\r\nIt happens, then, that as harvest work is wanted to be done\r\nexpeditiously, it is let out by the piece, by which the labourer\r\ngets more money and more cider. But consider, my masters, that, when\r\nnot under these stimulants, you can only expect from the workman a\r\nlanguid day’s work when the excitement is over; and too often, indeed,\r\nthe poor man gets a long illness as the result of his forced, that is,\r\nstimulated labour, and, if not, such a system of drawing upon his\r\ncapital—strength—is certain to end in premature old age.\r\n\r\nSeeing, however, that the labourer has got to believe that drink keeps\r\nup his strength, it too often follows that he concludes that the more he\r\ngets of it the better; and hence, as a rule, there is no satisfying him\r\nupon this head, and the result is, that the labourer too often keeps\r\nhimself in that state of thirst and muzziness during his work that\r\nalmost compels him to seek the public-house when work is done. Here\r\nquarrels ensue, and it is a wonder that manslaughter is not more\r\nfrequently the result. Expelled from the scene of his debauch, he finds\r\nhis way home, unless, as is not unfrequent, he is “found drowned” in the\r\nriver by which he may have to pass.\r\n\r\nThis is no fancied sketch, as it is derived from the sad experience of\r\nthe author and the result of events in his own parish. On one melancholy\r\noccasion it was indeed sad to hear the Coroner, among other remarks,\r\nobserve that full four-fifths of the inquests in a cider county were the\r\nresult of drink.\r\n\r\nIs there not, then, a heavy responsibility resting upon the farmer in\r\nespecial connection with cider, while his men are partially paid in this\r\nfluid? It is different in the beer-drinking counties, as beer costs more\r\nmoney, and is never allowed in such quantity as cider. Put it down as\r\ntrue that the farmer _at times_ gets more work out of his men by plying\r\nthem with cider, yet we feel sure he thereby hastens the time when such\r\nmen can no longer work, and they have then to be chargeable to the\r\nparish, if in the mean time nothing worse should happen.\r\n\r\nMechanics are not paid in drink; they purchase what they require out of\r\nregular wages, and thus they have the option, which many of them take\r\nadvantage of, of leaving off strong drink altogether; and though they\r\ntoo are sometimes hard pressed to get a piece of work done, yet, by\r\nover-hours, for which they are rightly paid, not, as in the country,\r\nwholly by cider, but in money, the business is managed, and the workman\r\ncan afford extra meat and bread, by which his worn muscles are truly\r\nrenovated, and not merely stimulated to frantic action as by drink. The\r\ngreat rise in the price of meat, even before cattle disease became rife,\r\nis due to the cause that so much more meat has, within the last five\r\nyears, been eaten by the British workman. In this advance, however, the\r\nfarm labourer has had no part; he rarely gets meat twice a week, while\r\nall this time his wages have advanced so much as 25 _per cent._, which\r\nrise, in nine cases out of ten, is only looked upon as a boon, inasmuch\r\nas it enables the recipient to “enjoy himself,” which simply means he\r\nhas more to spend at the public-house.\r\n\r\nWe conclude, as the result of experience, that each sack of corn that\r\nfinds its way to market from a cider county costs 1s. (or 3d. per\r\nbushel) in drink, which, though it is produced on the farm, might yet\r\nhave been sold to produce that amount.\r\n\r\nWould it then not be better to sell such farm produce, and, by giving\r\nextra money instead of drink to the labourers, and so, by allowing him\r\nthe option of taking less drink but more meat, gradually to withdraw him\r\nfrom the temptations to get drunk, which beset him under the present\r\nsystem? For, while we feel quite sure that the morbid craving for the\r\npublic-house has commenced with drinking on the farm, we may be certain\r\nthat if by any means we can check this system, it will ultimately be a\r\ngreat gain to both master and man.\r\n\r\nWhere are farm labourers best off? We say in the non-cider counties. In\r\nthese he has learnt the use of skim-milk and the value of meat. In cider\r\ncounties the farm labourer despises skim-milk as “poor weak tack, only\r\nfit for pigs.” He cannot get meat, as he takes part of his wage in a\r\nstimulant which excites him to spend some of his money in falsely\r\n“_keeping up his strength_.”\r\n\r\nNow what are the results? We unhesitatingly assert, muscle, longevity,\r\nmore robust, honest, well-to-do families, healthier bodies and minds,\r\nbeyond the cider limits.\r\n\r\nIf, then, these things be so, some change in the use and economy of this\r\nwholesome drink is an object worthy of the deepest and most earnest\r\nconsideration. One man alone can do no good. Beneficial results can only\r\nfollow upon calm discussion and combined action by the masters, upon\r\nwell ascertained facts. We would not stint the labourer of that which is\r\nto do him good; and if we find that he is really willing and capable of\r\ntaking the whole responsibility connected with his drinking requirements\r\nupon his own shoulders, we cannot help thinking that it would be for the\r\ngood of all parties to pay increased wages in full rather than any\r\nportion in kind, and more especially of the kind we have thus\r\nanimadverted upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn bringing these Papers to a conclusion, we would, among other matters,\r\nmake a few remarks upon the title under which they have been issued,\r\nnamely, _Science and Practice of Farm Cultivation_.\r\n\r\nNow it will be seen that our object has not been to enter into the\r\nminutiæ of practical farming, but rather to point out some of the more\r\nimportant scientific principles by which much of practice is regulated.\r\nHence, then, we would beg the reader to amend the title as\r\nfollows:—“Science _of_ Practice _in_ Farm Cultivation.” This will more\r\nfully explain the aim and object we have had in view in the series of\r\nPapers now concluded.\r\n\r\nIt is now time to tender our best acknowledgements for the aid we have\r\nreceived in the many drawings with which this small work has been so\r\nliberally illustrated. We owe especial thanks to Mr. Hardwicke for\r\nseveral fine plates of interesting agricultural as well as botanical\r\nspecimens; to the Royal Agricultural Society of England for the loan of\r\nthe woodcuts of roots; and to our friend Mr. Wheeler, of Gloucester, for\r\nthe use of the woodcut illustrations of grasses; and as both the\r\ndrawings of roots and grasses were made by us direct on the wood, rough\r\nthough they may be, we yet hope they may be deemed more faithful than\r\nany second-hand copy.\r\n\r\nOur labours being ended, it only remains to add that we hope our little\r\nwork may have the effect of inducing some of our agricultural friends to\r\nlook into the principles connected with the various operations which\r\nthey daily superintend, as by so doing agriculture will be really\r\nelevated to a science; whereas, by merely copying what has been done\r\nbefore, we shall only be empirics, practising rational empiricism it is\r\ntrue, but still coming short of that light and knowledge which is the\r\nlife,—_the science_ of our profession.\r\n\r\nJ.
