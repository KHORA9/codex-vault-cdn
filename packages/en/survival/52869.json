Mixed fractions have been displayed with a hyphen between\r\nwhole number and fraction for clarity. Superscripted characters are\r\npreceded by ^ and when more than one character is superscripted, they\r\nare surrounded by {}. This book uses some unusual characters, such as\r\nthose representing the constellation Aries (♈) and Libra (♎). These\r\ncharacters may fail to display correctly if the font you are using does\r\nnot support them.\r\n\r\nSome corrections have been made to the printed text.

The\r\ncontemplation of the works of creation elevates the mind to the\r\nadmiration of whatever is great and noble; accomplishing the object of\r\nall study, which, in the eloquent language of Sir James Mackintosh, “is\r\nto inspire the love of truth, of wisdom, of beauty—especially of\r\ngoodness, the highest beauty—and of that supreme and eternal Mind, which\r\ncontains all truth and wisdom, all beauty and goodness. By the love or\r\ndelightful contemplation and pursuit of these transcendent aims, for\r\ntheir own sake only, the mind of man is raised from low and perishable\r\nobjects, and prepared for those high destinies which are appointed for\r\nall those who are capable of them.”\r\n\r\nAstronomy affords the most extensive example of the connection of the\r\nphysical sciences. In it are combined the sciences of number and\r\nquantity, of rest and motion. In it we perceive the operation of a force\r\nwhich is mixed up with everything that exists in the heavens or on\r\nearth; which pervades every atom, rules the motions of animate and\r\ninanimate beings, and is as sensible in the descent of a rain-drop as in\r\nthe falls of Niagara; in the weight of the air, as in the periods of the\r\nmoon. Gravitation not only binds satellites to their planet, and planets\r\nto the sun, but it connects sun with sun throughout the wide extent of\r\ncreation, and is the cause of the disturbances, as well as of the order\r\nof nature; since every tremor it excites in any one planet is\r\nimmediately transmitted to the farthest limits of the system, in\r\noscillations which correspond in their periods with the cause producing\r\nthem, like sympathetic notes in music, or vibrations from the deep tones\r\nof an organ.\r\n\r\nThe heavens afford the most sublime subject of study which can be\r\nderived from science. The magnitude and splendour of the objects, the\r\ninconceivable rapidity with which they move, and the enormous distances\r\nbetween them, impress the mind with some notion of the energy that\r\nmaintains them in their motions, with a durability to which we can see\r\nno limit. Equally conspicuous is the goodness of the great First Cause,\r\nin having endowed man with faculties, by which he can not only\r\nappreciate the magnificence of His works, but trace, with precision, the\r\noperation of His laws, use the globe he inhabits as a base wherewith to\r\nmeasure the magnitude and distance of the sun and planets, and make the\r\ndiameter (Note 1) of the earth’s orbit the first step of a scale by\r\nwhich he may ascend to the starry firmament. Such pursuits, while they\r\nennoble the mind, at the same time inculcate humility, by showing that\r\nthere is a barrier which no energy, mental or physical, can ever enable\r\nus to pass: that, however profoundly we may penetrate the depths of\r\nspace, there still remain innumerable systems, compared with which,\r\nthose apparently so vast must dwindle into insignificance, or even\r\nbecome invisible; and that not only man, but the globe he inhabits—nay,\r\nthe whole system of which it forms so small a part—might be annihilated,\r\nand its extinction be unperceived in the immensity of creation.\r\n\r\nA complete acquaintance with physical astronomy can be attained by those\r\nonly who are well versed in the higher branches of mathematical and\r\nmechanical science (N. 2), and they alone can appreciate the extreme\r\nbeauty of the results, and of the means by which these results are\r\nobtained. It is nevertheless true, that a sufficient skill in analysis\r\n(N. 3) to follow the general outline—to see the mutual dependence of the\r\ndifferent parts of the system, and to comprehend by what means the most\r\nextraordinary conclusions have been arrived at,—is within the reach of\r\nmany who shrink from the task, appalled by difficulties, not more\r\nformidable than those incident to the study of the elements of every\r\nbranch of knowledge. There is a wide distinction between the degree of\r\nmathematical acquirement necessary for making discoveries, and that\r\nwhich is requisite for understanding what others have done.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of external objects is founded upon experience, which\r\nfurnishes facts; the comparison of these facts establishes relations,\r\nfrom which the belief that like causes will produce like effects leads\r\nto general laws. Thus, experience teaches that bodies fall at the\r\nsurface of the earth with an accelerated velocity, and with a force\r\nproportional to their masses. By comparison, Newton proved that the\r\nforce which occasions the fall of bodies at the earth’s surface is\r\nidentical with that which retains the moon in her orbit; and he\r\nconcluded, that, as the moon is kept in her orbit by the attraction of\r\nthe earth, so the planets might be retained in their orbits by the\r\nattraction of the sun. By such steps he was led to the discovery of one\r\nof those powers with which the Creator has ordained that matter should\r\nreciprocally act upon matter.\r\n\r\nPhysical astronomy is the science which compares and identifies the laws\r\nof motion observed on earth with the motions that take place in the\r\nheavens: and which traces, by an uninterrupted chain of deduction from\r\nthe great principle that governs the universe, the revolutions and\r\nrotations of the planets, and the oscillations (N. 4) of the fluids at\r\ntheir surfaces; and which estimates the changes the system has hitherto\r\nundergone, or may hereafter experience—changes which require millions of\r\nyears for their accomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe accumulated efforts of astronomers, from the earliest dawn of\r\ncivilization, have been necessary to establish the mechanical theory of\r\nastronomy. The courses of the planets have been observed for ages, with\r\na degree of perseverance that is astonishing, if we consider the\r\nimperfection and even the want of instruments. The real motions of the\r\nearth have been separated from the apparent motions of the planets; the\r\nlaws of the planetary revolutions have been discovered; and the\r\ndiscovery of these laws has led to the knowledge of the gravitation\r\n(N. 5) of matter. On the other hand, descending from the principle of\r\ngravitation, every motion in the solar system has been so completely\r\nexplained, that the laws of any astronomical phenomena that may\r\nhereafter occur are already determined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SECTION I.\r\n\r\nAttraction of a Sphere—Form of Celestial Bodies—Terrestrial Gravitation\r\n  retains the Moon in her Orbit—The Heavenly Bodies move in Conic\r\n  Sections—Gravitation Proportional to Mass—Gravitation of the Particles\r\n  of Matter—Figure of the Planets—How it affects the Motions of their\r\n  Satellites—Rotation and Translation impressed by the same\r\n  Impulse—Motion of the Sun and Solar System.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT has been proved by Newton, that a particle of matter (N. 6) placed\r\nwithout the surface of a hollow sphere (N. 7) is attracted by it in the\r\nsame manner as if the mass of the hollow sphere, or the whole matter it\r\ncontains, were collected into one dense particle in its centre. The same\r\nis therefore true of a solid sphere, which may be supposed to consist of\r\nan infinite number of concentric hollow spheres (N. 8). This, however,\r\nis not the case with a spheroid (N. 9); but the celestial bodies are so\r\nnearly spherical, and at such remote distances from one another, that\r\nthey attract and are attracted as if each were condensed into a single\r\nparticle situate in its centre of gravity (N. 10)—a circumstance which\r\ngreatly facilitates the investigation of their motions.\r\n\r\nNewton has shown that the force which retains the moon in her orbit is\r\nthe same with that which causes heavy substances to fall at the surface\r\nof the earth. If the earth were a sphere, and at rest, a body would be\r\nequally attracted, that is, it would have the same weight at every point\r\nof its surface, because the surface of a sphere is everywhere equally\r\ndistant from its centre. But, as our planet is flattened at the poles\r\n(N. 11), and bulges at the equator, the weight of the same body\r\ngradually decreases from the poles, where it is greatest, to the\r\nequator, where it is least. There is, however, a certain mean (N. 12)\r\nlatitude (N. 13), or part of the earth intermediate between the pole and\r\nthe equator, where the attraction of the earth on bodies at its surface\r\nis the same as if it were a sphere; and experience shows that bodies\r\nthere fall through 16·0697 feet in a second. The mean distance (N. 14)\r\nof the moon from the earth is about sixty times the mean radius (N. 15)\r\nof the earth. When the number 16·0697 is diminished in the ratio (N. 16)\r\nof 1 to 3600, which is the square of the moon’s distance (N. 17) from\r\nthe earth’s centre, estimated in terrestrial radii, it is found to be\r\nexactly the space the moon would fall through in the first second of her\r\ndescent to the earth, were she not prevented by the centrifugal force\r\n(N. 18) arising from the velocity with which she moves in her orbit. The\r\nmoon is thus retained in her orbit by a force having the same origin,\r\nand regulated by the same law, with that which causes a stone to fall at\r\nthe earth’s surface. The earth may, therefore, be regarded as the centre\r\nof a force which extends to the moon; and, as experience shows that the\r\naction and reaction of matter are equal and contrary (N. 19), the moon\r\nmust attract the earth with an equal and contrary force.\r\n\r\nNewton also ascertained that a body projected (N. 20) in space (N. 21)\r\nwill move in a conic section (N. 22), if attracted by a force proceeding\r\nfrom a fixed point, with an intensity inversely as the square of the\r\ndistance (N. 23); but that any deviation from that law will cause it to\r\nmove in a curve of a different nature. Kepler found, by direct\r\nobservation, that the planets describe ellipses (N. 24), or oval paths,\r\nround the sun. Later observations show that comets also move in conic\r\nsections. It consequently follows that the sun attracts all the planets\r\nand comets inversely as the square of their distances from its centre;\r\nthe sun, therefore, is the centre of a force extending indefinitely in\r\nspace, and including all the bodies of the system in its action.\r\n\r\nKepler also deduced from observation that the squares of the periodic\r\ntimes (N. 25) of the planets, or the times of their revolutions round\r\nthe sun, are proportional to the cubes of their mean distances from its\r\ncentre (N. 26). Hence the intensity of gravitation of all the bodies\r\ntowards the sun is the same at equal distances. Consequently,\r\ngravitation is proportional to the masses (N. 27); for, if the planets\r\nand comets were at equal distances from the sun, and left to the effects\r\nof gravity, they would arrive at his surface at the same time (N. 28).\r\nThe satellites also gravitate to their primaries (N. 29) according to\r\nthe same law that their primaries do to the sun. Thus, by the law of\r\naction and reaction, each body is itself the centre of an attractive\r\nforce extending indefinitely in space, causing all the mutual\r\ndisturbances which render the celestial motions so complicated, and\r\ntheir investigation so difficult.\r\n\r\nThe gravitation of matter directed to a centre, and attracting directly\r\nas the mass and inversely as the square of the distance, does not belong\r\nto it when considered in mass only; particle acts on particle according\r\nto the same law when at sensible distances from each other. If the sun\r\nacted on the centre of the earth, without attracting each of its\r\nparticles, the tides would be very much greater than they now are, and\r\nwould also, in other respects, be very different. The gravitation of the\r\nearth to the sun results from the gravitation of all its particles,\r\nwhich, in their turn, attract the sun in the ratio of their respective\r\nmasses. There is a reciprocal action likewise between the earth and\r\nevery particle at its surface. The earth and a feather mutually attract\r\neach other in the proportion of the mass of the earth to the mass of the\r\nfeather. Were this not the case, and were any portion of the earth,\r\nhowever small, to attract another portion, and not be itself attracted,\r\nthe centre of gravity of the earth would be moved in space by this\r\naction, which is impossible.\r\n\r\nThe forms of the planets result from the reciprocal attraction of their\r\ncomponent particles. A detached fluid mass, if at rest, would assume the\r\nform of a sphere, from the reciprocal attraction of its particles. But\r\nif the mass revolve about an axis, it becomes flattened at the poles and\r\nbulges at the equator (N. 11), in consequence of the centrifugal force\r\narising from the velocity of rotation (N. 30); for the centrifugal force\r\ndiminishes the gravity of the particles at the equator, and equilibrium\r\ncan only exist where these two forces are balanced by an increase of\r\ngravity. Therefore, as the attractive force is the same on all particles\r\nat equal distances from the centre of a sphere, the equatorial particles\r\nwould recede from the centre, till their increase in number balance the\r\ncentrifugal force by their attraction. Consequently, the sphere would\r\nbecome an oblate or flattened spheroid, and a fluid, partially or\r\nentirely covering a solid, as the ocean and atmosphere cover the earth,\r\nmust assume that form in order to remain in equilibrio. The surface of\r\nthe sea is, therefore, spheroidal, and the surface of the earth only\r\ndeviates from that figure where it rises above or sinks below the level\r\nof the sea. But the deviation is so small, that it is unimportant when\r\ncompared with the magnitude of the earth; for the mighty chain of the\r\nAndes, and the yet more lofty Himalaya, bear about the same proportion\r\nto the earth that a grain of sand does to a globe three feet in\r\ndiameter. Such is the form of the earth and planets. The compression\r\n(N. 31) or flattening at their poles is, however, so small, that even\r\nJupiter, whose rotation is the most rapid, and therefore the most\r\nelliptical of the planets, may, from his great distance, be regarded as\r\nspherical. Although the planets attract each other as if they were\r\nspheres, on account of their distances, yet the satellites (N. 32) are\r\nnear enough to be sensibly affected in their motions by the forms of\r\ntheir primaries. The moon, for example, is so near the earth, that the\r\nreciprocal attraction between each of her particles, and each of the\r\nparticles in the prominent mass at the terrestrial equator, occasions\r\nconsiderable disturbances in the motions of both bodies; for the action\r\nof the moon on the matter at the earth’s equator produces a nutation\r\n(N. 33) in the axis (N. 34) of rotation, and the reaction of that matter\r\non the moon is the cause of a corresponding nutation in the lunar orbit\r\n(N. 35).\r\n\r\nIf a sphere at rest in space receive an impulse passing through its\r\ncentre of gravity, all its parts will move with an equal velocity in a\r\nstraight line; but, if the impulse does not pass through the centre of\r\ngravity, its particles, having unequal velocities, will have a rotatory\r\nor revolving motion, at the same time that it is translated (N. 36) in\r\nspace. These motions are independent of one another; so that a contrary\r\nimpulse, passing through its centre of gravity, will impede its\r\nprogress, without interfering with its rotation. The sun rotates about\r\nan axis, and modern observations show that an impulse in a contrary\r\ndirection has not been given to his centre of gravity, for he moves in\r\nspace, accompanied by all those bodies which compose the solar system—a\r\ncircumstance which in no way interferes with their relative motions;\r\nfor, in consequence of the principle that force is proportional to\r\nvelocity (N. 37), the reciprocal attractions of a system remain the same\r\nwhether its centre of gravity be at rest, or moving uniformly in space.\r\nIt is computed that, had the earth received its motion from a single\r\nimpulse, that impulse must have passed through a point about twenty-five\r\nmiles from its centre.\r\n\r\nSince the motions of rotation and translation of the planets are\r\nindependent of each other, though probably communicated by the same\r\nimpulse, they form separate subjects of investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION II.\r\n\r\nElliptical Motion—Mean and True\r\n  Motion—Equinoctial—Ecliptic—Equinoxes—Mean and True Longitude—Equation\r\n  of Centre—Inclination of the Orbits of Planets—Celestial\r\n  Latitude—Nodes—Elements of an Orbit—Undisturbed or Elliptical\r\n  Orbits—Great Inclination of the Orbits of the New Planets—Universal\r\n  Gravitation the Cause of Perturbations in the Motions of the Heavenly\r\n  Bodies—Problem of the Three Bodies—Stability of Solar System depends\r\n  upon the Primitive Momentum of the Bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PLANET moves in its elliptical orbit with a velocity varying every\r\ninstant, in consequence of two forces, one tending to the centre of the\r\nsun, and the other in the direction of a tangent (N. 38) to its orbit,\r\narising from the primitive impulse given at the time when it was\r\nlaunched into space. Should the force in the tangent cease, the planet\r\nwould fall to the sun by its gravity. Were the sun not to attract it,\r\nthe planet would fly off in the tangent. Thus, when the planet is at the\r\npoint of its orbit farthest from the sun, his action overcomes the\r\nplanet’s velocity, and brings it towards him with such an accelerated\r\nmotion, that at last it overcomes the sun’s attraction, and, shooting\r\npast him, gradually decreases in velocity until it arrives at the most\r\ndistant point, where the sun’s attraction again prevails (N. 39). In\r\nthis motion the _radii vectores_ (N. 40), or imaginary lines joining the\r\ncentres of the sun and the planets, pass over equal areas or spaces in\r\nequal times (N. 41).\r\n\r\nThe mean distance of a planet from the sun is equal to half the major\r\naxis (N. 42) of its orbit: if, therefore, the planet described a circle\r\n(N. 43) round the sun at its mean distance, the motion would be uniform,\r\nand the periodic time unaltered, because the planet would arrive at the\r\nextremities of the major axis at the same instant, and would have the\r\nsame velocity, whether it moved in the circular or elliptical orbit,\r\nsince the curves coincide in these points. But in every other part the\r\nelliptical, or true motion (N. 44), would either be faster or slower\r\nthan the circular or mean motion (N. 45). As it is necessary to have\r\nsome fixed point in the heavens from whence to estimate these motions,\r\nthe vernal equinox (N. 46) at a given epoch has been chosen. The\r\nequinoctial, which is a great circle traced in the starry heavens by the\r\nimaginary extension of the plane of the terrestrial equator, is\r\nintersected by the ecliptic, or apparent path of the sun, in two points\r\ndiametrically opposite to one another, called the vernal and autumnal\r\nequinoxes. The vernal equinox is the point through which the sun passes\r\nin going from the southern to the northern hemisphere; and the autumnal,\r\nthat in which he crosses from the northern to the southern. The mean or\r\ncircular motion of a body, estimated from the vernal equinox, is its\r\nmean longitude; and its elliptical, or true motion, reckoned from that\r\npoint, is its true longitude (N. 47): both being estimated from west to\r\neast, the direction in which the bodies move. The difference between the\r\ntwo is called the equation of the centre (N. 48); which consequently\r\nvanishes at the apsides (N. 49), or extremities of the major axis, and\r\nis at its maximum ninety degrees (N. 50) distant from these points, or\r\nin quadratures (N. 51), where it measures the excentricity (N. 52) of\r\nthe orbit; so that the place of the planet in its elliptical orbit is\r\nobtained by adding or subtracting the equation of the centre to or from\r\nits mean longitude.\r\n\r\nThe orbits of the principal planets have a very small obliquity or\r\ninclination (N. 53) to the plane of the ecliptic in which the earth\r\nmoves; and, on that account, astronomers refer their motions to this\r\nplane at a given epoch as a known and fixed position. The angular\r\ndistance of a planet from the plane of the ecliptic is its latitude\r\n(N. 54), which is south or north according as the planet is south or\r\nnorth of that plane. When the planet is in the plane of the ecliptic,\r\nits latitude is zero; it is then said to be in its nodes (N. 55). The\r\nascending node is that point in the ecliptic through which the planet\r\npasses in going from the southern to the northern hemisphere. The\r\ndescending node is a corresponding point in the plane of the ecliptic\r\ndiametrically opposite to the other, through which the planet descends\r\nin going from the northern to the southern hemisphere. The longitude and\r\nlatitude of a planet cannot be obtained by direct observation, but are\r\ndeduced from observations made at the surface of the earth by a very\r\nsimple computation. These two quantities, however, will not give the\r\nplace of a planet in space. Its distance from the sun (N. 56) must also\r\nbe known; and, for the complete determination of its elliptical motion,\r\nthe nature and position of its orbit must be ascertained by observation.\r\nThis depends upon seven quantities, called the elements of the orbit\r\n(N. 57). These are, the length of the major axis, and the excentricity,\r\nwhich determine the form of the orbit; the longitude of the planet when\r\nat its least distance from the sun, called the longitude of the\r\nperihelion; the inclination of the orbit to the plane of the ecliptic,\r\nand the longitude of its ascending node: these give the position of the\r\norbit in space; but the periodic time, and the longitude of the planet\r\nat a given instant, called the longitude of the epoch, are necessary for\r\nfinding the place of the body in its orbit at all times. A perfect\r\nknowledge of these seven elements is requisite for ascertaining all the\r\ncircumstances of undisturbed elliptical motion. By such means it is\r\nfound that the paths of the planets, when their mutual disturbances are\r\nomitted, are ellipses nearly approaching to circles, whose planes,\r\nslightly inclined to the ecliptic, cut it in straight lines, passing\r\nthrough the centre of the sun (N. 58). The orbits of the\r\nrecently-discovered planets deviate more from the ecliptic than those of\r\nthe ancient planets: that of Pallas, for instance, has an inclination of\r\n34° 42ʹ 29·8ʺ to it; on which account it is more difficult to determine\r\ntheir motions.\r\n\r\nWere the planets attracted by the sun only, they would always move in\r\nellipses, invariable in form and position; and because his action is\r\nproportional to his mass, which is much larger than that of all the\r\nplanets put together, the elliptical is the nearest approximation to\r\ntheir true motions. The true motions of the planets are extremely\r\ncomplicated, in consequence of their mutual attraction, so that they do\r\nnot move in any known or symmetrical curve, but in paths now approaching\r\nto, now receding from, the elliptical form; and their radii vectores do\r\nnot describe areas or spaces exactly proportional to the time, so that\r\nthe areas become a test of disturbing forces.\r\n\r\nTo determine the motion of each body, when disturbed by all the rest, is\r\nbeyond the power of analysis. It is therefore necessary to estimate the\r\ndisturbing action of one planet at a time, whence the celebrated problem\r\nof the three bodies, originally applied to the moon, the earth, and the\r\nsun—namely, the masses being given of three bodies projected from three\r\ngiven points, with velocities given both in quantity and direction; and\r\nsupposing the bodies to gravitate to one another with forces that are\r\ndirectly as their masses, and inversely as the squares of the distances,\r\nto find the lines described by these bodies, and their positions at any\r\ngiven instant; or, in other words, to determine the path of a celestial\r\nbody when attracted by a second body, and disturbed in its motion round\r\nthe second body by a third—a problem equally applicable to planets,\r\nsatellites, and comets.\r\n\r\nBy this problem the motions of translation of the celestial bodies are\r\ndetermined. It is an extremely difficult one, and would be infinitely\r\nmore so if the disturbing action were not very small when compared with\r\nthe central force; that is, if the action of the planets on one another\r\nwere not very small when compared with that of the sun. As the\r\ndisturbing influence of each body may be found separately, it is assumed\r\nthat the action of the whole system, in disturbing any one planet, is\r\nequal to the sum of all the particular disturbances it experiences, on\r\nthe general mechanical principle, that the sum of any number of small\r\noscillations is nearly equal to their simultaneous and joint effect.\r\n\r\nOn account of the reciprocal action of matter, the stability of the\r\nsystem depends upon the intensity of the primitive momentum (N. 59) of\r\nthe planets, and the ratio of their masses to that of the sun; for the\r\nnature of the conic sections in which the celestial bodies move depends\r\nupon the velocity with which they were first propelled in space. Had\r\nthat velocity been such as to make the planets move in orbits of\r\nunstable equilibrium (N. 60), their mutual attractions might have\r\nchanged them into parabolas, or even hyperbolas (N. 22); so that the\r\nearth and planets might, ages ago, have been sweeping far from our sun\r\nthrough the abyss of space. But as the orbits differ very little from\r\ncircles, the momentum of the planets, when projected, must have been\r\nexactly sufficient to ensure the permanency and stability of the system.\r\nBesides, the mass of the sun is vastly greater than that of any planet;\r\nand as their inequalities bear the same ratio to their elliptical\r\nmotions that their masses do to that of the sun, their mutual\r\ndisturbances only increase or diminish the excentricities of their\r\norbits by very minute quantities; consequently the magnitude of the\r\nsun’s mass is the principal cause of the stability of the system. There\r\nis not in the physical world a more splendid example of the adaptation\r\nof means to the accomplishment of an end than is exhibited in the nice\r\nadjustment of these forces, at once the cause of the variety and of the\r\norder of Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION III.\r\n\r\nPerturbations, Periodic and Secular—Disturbing Action equivalent to\r\n  three Partial Forces—Tangential Force the cause of the Periodic\r\n  Inequalities in Longitude, and Secular Inequalities in the Form and\r\n  Position of the Orbit in its own Plane—Radial Force the cause of\r\n  Variations in the Planet’s Distance from the Sun—It combines with the\r\n  Tangential Force to produce the Secular Variations in the Form and\r\n  Position of the Orbit in its own Plane—Perpendicular Force the cause\r\n  of Periodic Perturbations in Latitude, and Secular Variations in the\r\n  Position of the Orbit with regard to the Plane of the Ecliptic—Mean\r\n  Motion and Major Axis Invariable—Stability of System—Effects of a\r\n  Resisting Medium—Invariable Plane of the Solar System and of the\r\n  Universe—Great Inequality of Jupiter and Saturn.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE planets are subject to disturbances of two kinds, both resulting\r\nfrom the constant operation of their reciprocal attraction: one kind,\r\ndepending upon their positions with regard to each other, begins from\r\nzero, increases to a maximum, decreases, and becomes zero again, when\r\nthe planets return to the same relative positions. In consequence of\r\nthese, the disturbed planet is sometimes drawn away from the sun,\r\nsometimes brought nearer to him: sometimes it is accelerated in its\r\nmotion, and sometimes retarded. At one time it is drawn above the plane\r\nof its orbit, at another time below it, according to the position of the\r\ndisturbing body. All such changes, being accomplished in short periods,\r\nsome in a few months, others in years, or in hundreds of years, are\r\ndenominated periodic inequalities. The inequalities of the other kind,\r\nthough occasioned likewise by the disturbing energy of the planets, are\r\nentirely independent of their relative positions. They depend upon the\r\nrelative positions of the orbits alone, whose forms and places in space\r\nare altered by very minute quantities, in immense periods of time, and\r\nare therefore called secular inequalities.\r\n\r\nThe periodical perturbations are compensated when the bodies return to\r\nthe same relative positions with regard to one another and to the sun:\r\nthe secular inequalities are compensated when the orbits return to the\r\nsame positions relatively to one another and to the plane of the\r\necliptic.\r\n\r\nPlanetary motion, including both these kinds of disturbance, may be\r\nrepresented by a body revolving in an ellipse, and making small and\r\ntransient deviations, now on one side of its path, and now on the other,\r\nwhilst the ellipse itself is slowly, but perpetually, changing both in\r\nform and position.\r\n\r\nThe periodic inequalities are merely transient deviations of a planet\r\nfrom its path, the most remarkable of which only lasts about 918 years;\r\nbut, in consequence of the secular disturbances, the apsides, or\r\nextremities of the major axes of all the orbits, have a direct but\r\nvariable motion in space, excepting those of the orbit of Venus, which\r\nare retrograde (N. 61), and the lines of the nodes move with a variable\r\nvelocity in a contrary direction. Besides these, the inclination and\r\nexcentricity of every orbit are in a state of perpetual but slow change.\r\nThese effects result from the disturbing action of all the planets on\r\neach. But, as it is only necessary to estimate the disturbing influence\r\nof one body at a time, what follows may convey some idea of the manner\r\nin which one planet disturbs the elliptical motion of another.\r\n\r\nSuppose two planets moving in ellipses round the sun; if one of them\r\nattracted the other and the sun with equal intensity, and in parallel\r\ndirections (N. 62), it would have no effect in disturbing the elliptical\r\nmotion. The inequality of this attraction is the sole cause of\r\nperturbation, and the difference between the disturbing planet’s action\r\non the sun and on the disturbed planet constitutes the disturbing force,\r\nwhich consequently varies in intensity and direction with every change\r\nin the relative positions of the three bodies. Although both the sun and\r\nplanet are under the influence of the disturbing force, the motion of\r\nthe disturbed planet is referred to the centre of the sun as a fixed\r\npoint, for convenience. The whole force (N. 63) which disturbs a planet\r\nis equivalent to three partial forces. One of these acts on the\r\ndisturbed planet, in the direction of a tangent to its orbit, and is\r\ncalled the tangential force: it occasions secular inequalities in the\r\nform and position of the orbit in its own plane, and is the sole cause\r\nof the periodical perturbations in the planet’s longitude. Another acts\r\nupon the same body in the direction of its radius vector, that is, in\r\nthe line joining the centres of the sun and planet, and is called the\r\nradial force: it produces periodical changes in the distance of the\r\nplanet from the sun, and affects the form and position of the orbit in\r\nits own plane. The third, which may be called the perpendicular force,\r\nacts at right angles to the plane of the orbit, occasions the periodic\r\ninequalities in the planet’s latitude, and affects the position of the\r\norbit with regard to the plane of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed, that the radius vector of a planet, moving in a\r\nperfectly elliptical orbit, passes over equal spaces or areas in equal\r\ntimes; a circumstance which is independent of the law of the force, and\r\nwould be the same whether it varied inversely as the square of the\r\ndistance, or not, provided only that it be directed to the centre of the\r\nsun. Hence the tangential force, not being directed to the centre,\r\noccasions an unequable description of areas, or, what is the same thing,\r\nit disturbs the motion of the planet in longitude. The tangential force\r\nsometimes accelerates the planet’s motion, sometimes retards it, and\r\noccasionally has no effect at all. Were the orbits of both planets\r\ncircular, a complete compensation would take place at each revolution of\r\nthe two planets, because the arcs in which the accelerations and\r\nretardations take place would be symmetrical on each side of the\r\ndisturbing force. For it is clear, that if the motion be accelerated\r\nthrough a certain space, and then retarded through as much, the motion\r\nat the end of the time will be the same as if no change had taken place.\r\nBut, as the orbits of the planets are ellipses, this symmetry does not\r\nhold: for, as the planet moves unequably in its orbit, it is in some\r\npositions more directly, and for a longer time, under the influence of\r\nthe disturbing force than in others. And, although multitudes of\r\nvariations do compensate each other in short periods, there are others,\r\ndepending on peculiar relations among the periodic times of the planets,\r\nwhich do not compensate each other till after one, or even till after\r\nmany revolutions of both bodies. A periodical inequality of this kind in\r\nthe motions of Jupiter and Saturn has a period of no less than 918\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe radial force, or that part of the disturbing force which acts in the\r\ndirection of the line joining the centres of the sun and disturbed\r\nplanet, has no effect on the areas, but is the cause of periodical\r\nchanges of small extent in the distance of the planet from the sun. It\r\nhas already been shown, that the force producing perfectly elliptical\r\nmotion varies inversely as the square of the distance, and that a force\r\nfollowing any other law would cause the body to move in a curve of a\r\nvery different kind. Now, the radial disturbing force varies directly as\r\nthe distance; and, as it sometimes combines with and increases the\r\nintensity of the sun’s attraction for the disturbed body, and at other\r\ntimes opposes and consequently diminishes it, in both cases it causes\r\nthe sun’s attraction to deviate from the exact law of gravity, and the\r\nwhole action of this compound central force on the disturbed body is\r\neither greater or less than what is requisite for perfectly elliptical\r\nmotion. When greater, the curvature of the disturbed planet’s path, on\r\nleaving its perihelion (N. 64), or point nearest the sun, is greater\r\nthan it would be in the ellipse, which brings the planet to its aphelion\r\n(N. 65), or point farthest from the sun, before it has passed through\r\n180°, as it would do if undisturbed. So that in this case the apsides,\r\nor extremities of the major axis, advance in space. When the central\r\nforce is less than the law of gravity requires, the curvature of the\r\nplanet’s path is less than the curvature of the ellipse. So that the\r\nplanet, on leaving its perihelion, would pass through more than 180°\r\nbefore arriving at its aphelion, which causes the apsides to recede in\r\nspace (N. 66). Cases both of advance and recess occur during a\r\nrevolution of the two planets; but those in which the apsides advance\r\npreponderate. This, however, is not the full amount of the motion of the\r\napsides; part arises also from the tangential force (N. 63), which\r\nalternately accelerates and retards the velocity of the disturbed\r\nplanet. An increase in the planet’s tangential velocity diminishes the\r\ncurvature of its orbit, and is equivalent to a decrease of central\r\nforce. On the contrary, a decrease of the tangential velocity, which\r\nincreases the curvature of the orbit, is equivalent to an increase of\r\ncentral force. These fluctuations, owing to the tangential force,\r\noccasion an alternate recess and advance of the apsides, after the\r\nmanner already explained (N. 66). An uncompensated portion of the direct\r\nmotion, arising from this cause, conspires with that already impressed\r\nby the radial force, and in some cases even nearly doubles the direct\r\nmotion of these points. The motion of the apsides may be represented by\r\nsupposing a planet to move in an ellipse, while the ellipse itself is\r\nslowly revolving about the sun in the same plane (N. 67). This motion of\r\nthe major axis, which is direct in all the orbits except that of the\r\nplanet Venus, is irregular, and so slow that it requires more than\r\n109,830 years for the major axis of the earth’s orbit to accomplish a\r\nsidereal revolution (N. 68), that is, to return to the same stars; and\r\n20,984 years to complete its tropical revolution (N. 69), or to return\r\nto the same equinox. The difference between these two periods arises\r\nfrom a retrograde motion in the equinoctial point, which meets the\r\nadvancing axis before it has completed its revolution with regard to the\r\nstars. The major axis of Jupiter’s orbit requires no less than 200,610\r\nyears to perform its sidereal revolution, and 22,748 years to accomplish\r\nits tropical revolution from the disturbing action of Saturn alone.\r\n\r\nA variation in the excentricity of the disturbed planet’s orbit is an\r\nimmediate consequence of the deviation from elliptical curvature, caused\r\nby the action of the disturbing force. When the path of the body, in\r\nproceeding from its perihelion to its aphelion, is more curved than it\r\nought to be from the effect of the disturbing forces, it falls within\r\nthe elliptical orbit, the excentricity is diminished, and the orbit\r\nbecomes more nearly circular; when that curvature is less than it ought\r\nto be, the path of the planet falls without its elliptical orbit\r\n(N. 66), and the excentricity is increased; during these changes, the\r\nlength of the major axis is not altered, the orbit only bulges out, or\r\nbecomes more flat (N. 70). Thus the variation in the excentricity arises\r\nfrom the same cause that occasions the motion of the apsides (N. 67).\r\nThere is an inseparable connection between these two elements: they vary\r\nsimultaneously, and have the same period; so that, whilst the major axis\r\nrevolves in an immense period of time, the excentricity increases and\r\ndecreases by very small quantities, and at length returns to its\r\noriginal magnitude at each revolution of the apsides. The terrestrial\r\nexcentricity is decreasing at the rate of about 40 miles annually; and,\r\nif it were to decrease equably, it would be 39,861 years before the\r\nearth’s orbit became a circle. The mutual action of Jupiter and Saturn\r\noccasions variations in the excentricity of both orbits, the greatest\r\nexcentricity of Jupiter’s orbit corresponding to the least of Saturn’s.\r\nThe period in which these vicissitudes are accomplished is 70,414 years,\r\nestimating the action of these two planets alone; but, if the action of\r\nall the planets were estimated, the cycle would extend to millions of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThat part of the disturbing force is now to be considered which acts\r\nperpendicularly to the plane of the orbit, causing periodic\r\nperturbations in latitude, secular variations in the inclination of the\r\norbit, and a retrograde motion to its nodes on the true plane of the\r\necliptic (N. 71). This force tends to pull the disturbed body above, or\r\npush (N. 72) it below, the plane of its orbit, according to the relative\r\npositions of the two planets with regard to the sun, considered to be\r\nfixed. By this action, it sometimes makes the plane of the orbit of the\r\ndisturbed body tend to coincide with the plane of the ecliptic, and\r\nsometimes increases its inclination to that plane. In consequence of\r\nwhich, its nodes alternately recede or advance on the ecliptic (N. 73).\r\nWhen the disturbing planet is in the line of the disturbed planet’s\r\nnodes (N. 74), it neither affects these points, the latitude, nor the\r\ninclination, because both planets are then in the same plane. When it is\r\nat right angles to the line of the nodes, and the orbit symmetrical on\r\neach side of the disturbing force, the average motion of these points,\r\nafter a revolution of the disturbed body, is retrograde, and\r\ncomparatively rapid: but, when the disturbing planet is so situated that\r\nthe orbit of the disturbed planet is not symmetrical on each side of the\r\ndisturbing force, which is most frequently the case, every possible\r\nvariety of action takes place. Consequently, the nodes are perpetually\r\nadvancing or receding with unequal velocity; but, as a compensation is\r\nnot effected, their motion is, on the whole, retrograde.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the variations in the inclination, it is clear, that,\r\nwhen the orbit is symmetrical on each side of the disturbing force, all\r\nits variations are compensated after a revolution of the disturbed body,\r\nand are merely periodical perturbations in the planet’s latitude; and no\r\nsecular change is induced in the inclination of the orbit. When, on the\r\ncontrary, that orbit is not symmetrical on each side of the disturbing\r\nforce, although many of the variations in latitude are transient or\r\nperiodical, still, after a complete revolution of the disturbed body, a\r\nportion remains uncompensated, which forms a secular change in the\r\ninclination of the orbit to the plane of the ecliptic. It is true, part\r\nof this secular change in the inclination is compensated by the\r\nrevolution of the disturbing body, whose motion has not hitherto been\r\ntaken into the account, so that perturbation compensates perturbation;\r\nbut still a comparatively permanent change is effected in the\r\ninclination, which is not compensated till the nodes have accomplished a\r\ncomplete revolution.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the inclination are extremely minute (N. 75), compared\r\nwith the motion of the nodes, and there is the same kind of inseparable\r\nconnection between their secular changes that there is between the\r\nvariation of the excentricity and the motion of the major axis. The\r\nnodes and inclinations vary simultaneously; their periods are the same,\r\nand very great. The nodes of Jupiter’s orbit, from the action of Saturn\r\nalone, require 36,261 years to accomplish even a tropical revolution. In\r\nwhat precedes, the influence of only one disturbing body has been\r\nconsidered; but, when the action and reaction of the whole system are\r\ntaken into account, every planet is acted upon, and does itself act, in\r\nthis manner, on all the others; and the joint effect keeps the\r\ninclinations and excentricities in a state of perpetual variation. It\r\nmakes the major axes of all the orbits continually revolve, and causes,\r\non an average, a retrograde motion of the nodes of each orbit upon every\r\nother. The ecliptic (N. 71) itself is in motion from the mutual action\r\nof the earth and planets, so that the whole is a compound phenomenon of\r\ngreat complexity, extending through unknown ages. At the present time\r\nthe inclinations of all the orbits are decreasing, but so slowly, that\r\nthe inclination of Jupiter’s orbit is only about six minutes less than\r\nit was in the age of Ptolemy.\r\n\r\nBut, in the midst of all these vicissitudes, the length of the major\r\naxes and the mean motions of the planets remain permanently independent\r\nof secular changes. They are so connected by Kepler’s law, of the\r\nsquares of the periodic times being proportional to the cubes of the\r\nmean distances of the planets from the sun, that one cannot vary without\r\naffecting the other. And it is proved, that any variations which do take\r\nplace are transient, and depend only on the relative positions of the\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, according to theory, the radial disturbing force should\r\npermanently alter the dimensions of all the orbits, and the periodic\r\ntimes of all the planets, to a certain degree. For example, the masses\r\nof all the planets revolving within the orbit of any one, such as Mars,\r\nby adding to the interior mass, increase the attracting force of the\r\nsun, which, therefore, must contract the dimensions of the orbit of that\r\nplanet, and diminish its periodic time; whilst the planets exterior to\r\nMars’s orbit must have the contrary effect. But the mass of the whole of\r\nthe planets and satellites taken together is so small, when compared\r\nwith that of the sun, that these effects are quite insensible, and could\r\nonly have been discovered by theory. And, as it is certain that the\r\nlength of the major axes and the mean motions are not permanently\r\nchanged by any other power whatever, it may be concluded that they are\r\ninvariable.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of these two elements, it appears that all the bodies\r\nare in motion, and every orbit in a state of perpetual change. Minute as\r\nthese changes are, they might be supposed to accumulate in the course of\r\nages, sufficiently to derange the whole order of nature, to alter the\r\nrelative positions of the planets, to put an end to the vicissitudes of\r\nthe seasons, and to bring about collisions which would involve our whole\r\nsystem, now so harmonious, in chaotic confusion. It is natural to\r\ninquire, what proof exists that nature will be preserved from such a\r\ncatastrophe? Nothing can be known from observation, since the existence\r\nof the human race has occupied comparatively but a point in duration,\r\nwhile these vicissitudes embrace myriads of ages. The proof is simple\r\nand conclusive. All the variations of the solar system, secular as well\r\nas periodic, are expressed analytically by the sines and cosines of\r\ncircular arcs (N. 76), which increase with the time; and, as a sine or\r\ncosine can never exceed the radius, but must oscillate between zero and\r\nunity, however much the time may increase, it follows that when the\r\nvariations have accumulated to a maximum by slow changes, in however\r\nlong a time, they decrease, by the same slow degrees, till they arrive\r\nat their smallest value, again to begin a new course; thus for ever\r\noscillating about a mean value. This circumstance, however, would be\r\ninsufficient, were it not for the small excentricities of the planetary\r\norbits, their minute inclinations to the plane of the ecliptic, and the\r\nrevolutions of all the bodies, as well planets as satellites, in the\r\nsame direction. These secure the perpetual stability of the solar system\r\n(N. 77). However, at the time that the stability was proved by La Grange\r\nand La Place, the telescopic planets between Mars and Jupiter had not\r\nbeen discovered; but La Grange, having investigated the subject under a\r\nvery general point of view, showed that, if a planetary system be\r\ncomposed of very unequal masses, the whole of the larger would maintain\r\nan unalterable stability with regard to the form and position of their\r\norbits, while the orbits of the lesser might undergo unlimited changes.\r\nM. Le Verrier has applied this to the solar system, and has found that\r\nthe orbits of all the larger planets will for ever maintain an\r\nunalterable stability in form and position; for, though liable to\r\nmutations of very long periods, they return again exactly to what they\r\noriginally were, oscillating between very narrow limits; but he found a\r\nzone of instability between the orbit of Mars, and twice the mean\r\ndistance of the earth from the sun,[1] or between 1·5 and 2·00;\r\ntherefore the position and form of the orbits of such of the telescopic\r\nplanets as revolve within that zone will be subject to unlimited\r\nvariations. But the orbits of those more remote from the sun than Flora,\r\nor beyond 2·20, will be stable, so that their excentricities and\r\ninclinations must always have been, and will always remain, very great,\r\nsince they must have depended upon the primitive conditions that\r\nprevailed when these planetary atoms were launched into space. The 51st\r\nof these small bodies, which was discovered, and the elements of its\r\norbit determined, by M. Valz, at Nimes, has a mean distance of 1·88; so\r\nit revolves within the zone of instability. It has a shorter periodic\r\ntime than any of those previously discovered, and a greater\r\nexcentricity, with the exception of Nysa. Its orbit cuts that of Mars,\r\nand comes nearer to the earth than the orbits of either Mars or Venus, a\r\ncircumstance which would be favourable for correcting the parallax of\r\nthe sun, or confirming its accuracy. The telescopic planets, numerous as\r\nthey are, have no influence on the motions of the larger planets, for\r\nJupiter has a diameter of 90,734 miles, while that of Pallas, his\r\nnearest neighbour, is only 97 miles, little more than the distance from\r\nLondon to Bath. The diameter of Mars, on the other side of the small\r\nplanets, is 4546 miles, and that of the earth 7925-1/2 miles, so that\r\nthe telescopic group are too minute to disturb the others. M. Le Verrier\r\nfound another zone of instability between Venus and the sun, on the\r\nborder of which Mercury is revolving, the inclination of whose orbit to\r\nthe plane of the ecliptic is about 7°, which is more than that of any of\r\nthe large planets. Neptune’s orbit is, no doubt, as stable as that of\r\nany other of the large planets, as the inclination is very small, but he\r\nwill have periodical variations of very long duration from the\r\nreciprocal attraction between him and Uranus, one especially of an\r\nenormous duration, similar to those of Jupiter and Saturn, and, like\r\nthem, depending on the time of his revolution round the sun, being\r\nnearly twice as long as that of Saturn. Mr. Adams has computed that\r\nNeptune produces a periodical perturbation in the motion of Uranus,\r\nwhose duration is about 6800 years.\r\n\r\nThe equilibrium of the system, however, would be deranged if the planets\r\nmoved in a resisting medium (N. 78) sufficiently dense to diminish their\r\ntangential velocity, for then both the excentricities and the major axes\r\nof the orbits would vary with the time, so that the stability of the\r\nsystem would be ultimately destroyed. The existence of an ethereal\r\nmedium is now proved; and, although it is so extremely rare that\r\nhitherto its effects on the motions of the planets have been altogether\r\ninsensible, there can be no doubt that, in the immensity of time, it\r\nwill modify the forms of the planetary orbits, and may at last even\r\ncause the destruction of our system, which in itself contains no\r\nprinciple of decay, unless a rotatory motion from west to east has been\r\ngiven to this medium by the bodies of the solar system, which have all\r\nbeen revolving about the sun in that direction for unknown ages. This\r\nrotation, which seems to be highly probable, may even have been coeval\r\nwith its creation. Such a vortex would have no effect on bodies moving\r\nwith it, but it would influence the motions of those revolving in a\r\ncontrary direction. It is possible that the disturbances experienced by\r\ncomets, which have already revealed the existence of this medium, may\r\nalso, in time, disclose its rotatory motion.\r\n\r\nThe form and position of the planetary orbits, and the motion of the\r\nbodies in the same direction, together with the periodicity of the terms\r\nin which the inequalities are expressed, assure us that the variations\r\nof the system are confined within very narrow limits, and that, although\r\nwe do not know the extent of the limits, nor the period of that grand\r\ncycle which probably embraces millions of years, yet they never will\r\nexceed what is requisite for the stability and harmony of the whole; for\r\nthe preservation of which every circumstance is so beautifully and\r\nwonderfully adapted.\r\n\r\nThe plane of the ecliptic itself, though assumed to be fixed at a given\r\nepoch for the convenience of astronomical computation, is subject to a\r\nminute secular variation of 45ʺ·7, occasioned by the reciprocal action\r\nof the planets. But, as this is also periodical, and cannot exceed 2°\r\n42ʹ, the terrestrial equator, which is inclined to it at an angle[2] of\r\n23° 27ʹ 28ʺ·29, will never coincide with the plane of the ecliptic: so\r\nthere never can be perpetual spring (N. 79). The rotation of the earth\r\nis uniform; therefore day and night, summer and winter, will continue\r\ntheir vicissitudes while the system endures, or is undisturbed by\r\nforeign causes.\r\n\r\n                        Yonder starry sphere\r\n              Of planets and of fix’d, in all her wheels,\r\n              Resembles nearest mazes intricate,\r\n              Eccentric, intervolved, yet regular,\r\n              Then most, when most irregular they seem.\r\n\r\nThe stability of our system was established by La Grange: “a discovery,”\r\nsays Professor Playfair, “that must render the name for ever memorable\r\nin science, and revered by those who delight in the contemplation of\r\nwhatever is excellent and sublime.” After Newton’s discovery of the\r\nmechanical laws of the elliptical orbits of the planets, that of their\r\nperiodical inequalities, by La Grange, is, without doubt, the noblest\r\ntruth in the mechanism of the heavens; and, in respect of the doctrine\r\nof final causes, it may be regarded as the greatest of all.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the permanency of our system, the secular variations in\r\nthe planetary orbits would have been extremely embarrassing to\r\nastronomers when it became necessary to compare observations separated\r\nby long periods. The difficulty was in part obviated, and the principle\r\nfor accomplishing it established, by La Place, and has since been\r\nextended by M. Poinsot. It appears that there exists an invariable plane\r\n(N. 80), passing through the centre of gravity of the system, about\r\nwhich the whole oscillates within very narrow limits, and that this\r\nplane will always remain parallel to itself, whatever changes time may\r\ninduce in the orbits of the planets, in the plane of the ecliptic, or\r\neven in the law of gravitation; provided only that our system remains\r\nunconnected with any other. The position of the plane is determined by\r\nthis property—that, if each particle in the system be multiplied by the\r\narea described upon this plane in a given time, by the projection of its\r\nradius vector about the common centre of gravity of the whole, the sum\r\nof all these products will be a maximum (N. 81). La Place found that the\r\nplane in question is inclined to the ecliptic at an angle of nearly 1°\r\n34ʹ 15ʺ, and that, in passing through the sun, and about midway between\r\nthe orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, it may be regarded as the equator of\r\nthe solar system, dividing it into two parts, which balance one another\r\nin all their motions. This plane of greatest inertia, by no means\r\npeculiar to the solar system, but existing in every system of bodies\r\nsubmitted to their mutual attractions only, always maintains a fixed\r\nposition, whence the oscillations of the system may be estimated through\r\nunlimited time. Future astronomers will know, from its immutability or\r\nvariation, whether the sun and his attendants are connected or not with\r\nthe other systems of the universe. Should there be no link between them,\r\nit may be inferred, from the rotation of the sun, that the centre of\r\ngravity (N. 82) of the system situate within his mass describes a\r\nstraight line in this invariable plane or great equator of the solar\r\nsystem, which, unaffected by the changes of time, will maintain its\r\nstability through endless ages. But, if the fixed stars, comets, or any\r\nunknown and unseen bodies, affect our sun and planets, the nodes of this\r\nplane will slowly recede on the plane of that immense orbit which the\r\nsun may describe about some most distant centre, in a period which it\r\ntranscends the power of man to determine. There is every reason to\r\nbelieve that this is the case; for it is more than probable that, remote\r\nas the fixed stars are, they in some degree influence our system, and\r\nthat even the invariability of this plane is relative, only appearing\r\nfixed to creatures incapable of estimating its minute and slow changes\r\nduring the small extent of time and space granted to the human race.\r\n“The development of such changes,” as M. Poinsot justly observes, “is\r\nsimilar to an enormous curve, of which we see so small an arc that we\r\nimagine it to be a straight line.” If we raise our views to the whole\r\nextent of the universe, and consider the stars, together with the sun,\r\nto be wandering bodies, revolving about the common centre of creation,\r\nwe may then recognise in the equatorial plane passing through the centre\r\nof gravity of the universe the only instance of absolute and eternal\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\nAll the periodic and secular inequalities deduced from the law of\r\ngravitation are so perfectly confirmed by observation, that analysis has\r\nbecome one of the most certain means of discovering the planetary\r\nirregularities, either when they are too small, or too long in their\r\nperiods, to be detected by other methods. Jupiter and Saturn, however,\r\nexhibit inequalities which for a long time seemed discordant with that\r\nlaw. All observations, from those of the Chinese and Arabs down to the\r\npresent day, prove that for ages the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn\r\nhave been affected by a great inequality of a very long period, forming\r\nan apparent anomaly in the theory of the planets. It was long known by\r\nobservation that five times the mean motion of Saturn is nearly equal to\r\ntwice that of Jupiter; a relation which the sagacity of La Place\r\nperceived to be the cause of a periodic irregularity in the mean motion\r\nof each of these planets, which completes its period in nearly 918\r\nyears, the one being retarded while the other is accelerated; but both\r\nthe magnitude and period of these quantities vary, in consequence of the\r\nsecular variations in the elements of the orbits. Suppose the two\r\nplanets to be on the same side of the sun, and all three in the same\r\nstraight line, they are then said to be in conjunction (N. 83). Now, if\r\nthey begin to move at the same time, one making exactly five revolutions\r\nin its orbit while the other only accomplishes two, it is clear that\r\nSaturn, the slow-moving body, will only have got through a part of its\r\norbit during the time that Jupiter has made one whole revolution and\r\npart of another, before they be again in conjunction. It is found that\r\nduring this time their mutual action is such as to produce a great many\r\nperturbations which compensate each other, but that there still remains\r\na portion outstanding, owing to the length of time during which the\r\nforces act in the same manner; and, if the conjunction always happened\r\nin the same point of the orbit, this uncompensated inequality in the\r\nmean motion would go on increasing till the periodic times and forms of\r\nthe orbits were completely and permanently changed: a case that would\r\nactually take place if Jupiter accomplished exactly five revolutions in\r\nthe time Saturn performed two. These revolutions are, however, not\r\nexactly commensurable; the points in which the conjunctions take place\r\nare in advance each time as much as 8°·37; so that the conjunctions do\r\nnot happen exactly in the same points of the orbits till after a period\r\nof 850 years; and, in consequence of this small advance, the planets are\r\nbrought into such relative positions, that the inequality, which seemed\r\nto threaten the stability of the system, is completely compensated, and\r\nthe bodies, having returned to the same relative positions with regard\r\nto one another and the sun, begin a new course. The secular variations\r\nin the elements of the orbit increase the period of the inequality to\r\n918 years (N. 84). As any perturbation which affects the mean motion\r\naffects also the major axis, the disturbing forces tend to diminish the\r\nmajor axis of Jupiter’s orbit, and increase that of Saturn’s, during one\r\nhalf of the period, and the contrary during the other half. This\r\ninequality is strictly periodical, since it depends upon the\r\nconfiguration (N. 85) of the two planets; and theory is confirmed by\r\nobservation, which shows that, in the course of twenty centuries,\r\nJupiter’s mean motion has been accelerated by about 3° 23ʹ, and Saturn’s\r\nretarded by 5° 13ʹ. Several instances of perturbations of this kind\r\noccur in the solar system. One, in the mean motions of the Earth and\r\nVenus, only amounting to a few seconds, has been recently worked out\r\nwith immense labour by Professor Airy. It accomplishes its changes in\r\n240 years, and arises from the circumstance of thirteen times the\r\nperiodic time of Venus being nearly equal to eight times that of the\r\nEarth. Small as it is, it is sensible in the motions of the Earth.\r\n\r\nIt might be imagined that the reciprocal action of such planets as have\r\nsatellites would be different from the influence of those that have\r\nnone. But the distances of the satellites from their primaries are\r\nincomparably less than the distances of the planets from the sun, and\r\nfrom one another. So that the system of a planet and its satellites\r\nmoves nearly as if all these bodies were united in their common centre\r\nof gravity. The action of the sun, however, in some degree disturbs the\r\nmotion of the satellites about their primary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION IV.\r\n\r\nTheory of Jupiter’s Satellites—Effects of the Figure of Jupiter upon his\r\n  Satellites—Position of their Orbits—Singular Laws among the Motions of\r\n  the first Three Satellites—Eclipses of the Satellites—Velocity of\r\n  Light—Aberration—Ethereal Medium—Satellites of Saturn and Uranus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE changes which take place in the planetary system are exhibited on a\r\nsmaller scale by Jupiter and his satellites; and, as the period\r\nrequisite for the development of the inequalities of these moons only\r\nextends to a few centuries, it may be regarded as an epitome of that\r\ngrand cycle which will not be accomplished by the planets in myriads of\r\nages. The revolutions of the satellites about Jupiter are precisely\r\nsimilar to those of the planets about the sun; it is true they are\r\ndisturbed by the sun, but his distance is so great, that their motions\r\nare nearly the same as if they were not under his influence. The\r\nsatellites, like the planets, were probably projected in elliptical\r\norbits: but, as the masses of the satellites are nearly 100,000 times\r\nless than that of Jupiter; and as the compression of Jupiter’s spheroid\r\nis so great, in consequence of his rapid rotation, that his equatorial\r\ndiameter exceeds his polar diameter by no less than 6000 miles; the\r\nimmense quantity of prominent matter at his equator must soon have given\r\nthe circular form observed in the orbits of the first and second\r\nsatellites, which its superior attraction will always maintain. The\r\nthird and fourth satellites, being farther removed from its influence,\r\nrevolve in orbits with a very small excentricity. And, although the\r\nfirst two sensibly move in circles, their orbits acquire a small\r\nellipticity, from the disturbances they experience (N. 86).\r\n\r\nIt has been stated, that the attraction of a sphere on an exterior body\r\nis the same as if its mass were united in one particle in its centre of\r\ngravity, and therefore inversely as the square of the distance. In a\r\nspheroid, however, there is an additional force arising from the bulging\r\nmass at its equator, which, not following the exact law of gravity, acts\r\nas a disturbing force. One effect of this disturbing force in the\r\nspheroid of Jupiter is to occasion a direct motion in the greater axes\r\nof the orbits of all his satellites, which is more rapid the nearer the\r\nsatellite is to the planet, and very much greater than that part of\r\ntheir motion which arises from the disturbing action of the sun. The\r\nsame cause occasions the orbits of the satellites to remain nearly in\r\nthe plane of Jupiter’s equator (N. 87), on account of which the\r\nsatellites are always seen nearly in the same line (N. 88); and the\r\npowerful action of that quantity of prominent matter is the reason why\r\nthe motions of the nodes of these small bodies are so much more rapid\r\nthan those of the planet. The nodes of the fourth satellite accomplish a\r\ntropical revolution in 531 years, while those of Jupiter’s orbit require\r\nno less than 36,261 years;—a proof of the reciprocal attraction between\r\neach particle of Jupiter’s equator and of the satellites. In fact, if\r\nthe satellites moved exactly in the plane of Jupiter’s equator, they\r\nwould not be pulled out of that plane, because his attraction would be\r\nequal on both sides of it. But, as their orbits have a small inclination\r\nto the plane of the planet’s equator, there is a want of symmetry, and\r\nthe action of the protuberant matter tends to make the nodes regress by\r\npulling the satellites above or below the planes of their orbits; an\r\naction which is so great on the interior satellites, that the motions of\r\ntheir nodes are nearly the same as if no other disturbing force existed.\r\n\r\nThe orbits of the satellites do not retain a permanent inclination,\r\neither to the plane of Jupiter’s equator, or to that of his orbit, but\r\nto certain planes passing between the two, and through their\r\nintersection. These have a greater inclination to his equator the\r\nfarther the satellite is removed, owing to the influence of Jupiter’s\r\ncompression; and they have a slow motion corresponding to secular\r\nvariations in the planes of Jupiter’s orbit and equator.\r\n\r\nThe satellites are not only subject to periodic and secular inequalities\r\nfrom their mutual attraction, similar to those which affect the motions\r\nand orbits of the planets, but also to others peculiar to themselves. Of\r\nthe periodic inequalities arising from their mutual attraction the most\r\nremarkable take place in the angular motions (N. 89) of the three\r\nnearest to Jupiter, the second of which receives from the first a\r\nperturbation similar to that which it produces in the third; and it\r\nexperiences from the third a perturbation similar to that which it\r\ncommunicates to the first. In the eclipses these two inequalities are\r\ncombined into one, whose period is 437·659 days. The variations peculiar\r\nto the satellites arise from the secular inequalities occasioned by the\r\naction of the planets in the form and position of Jupiter’s orbit, and\r\nfrom the displacement of his equator. It is obvious that whatever alters\r\nthe relative positions of the sun, Jupiter, and his satellites, must\r\noccasion a change in the directions and intensities of the forces, which\r\nwill affect the motions and orbits of the satellites. For this reason\r\nthe secular variations in the excentricity of Jupiter’s orbit occasion\r\nsecular inequalities in the mean motions of the satellites, and in the\r\nmotions of the nodes and apsides of their orbits. The displacement of\r\nthe orbit of Jupiter, and the variation in the position of his equator,\r\nalso affect these small bodies (N. 90). The plane of Jupiter’s equator\r\nis inclined to the plane of his orbit at an angle of 3° 5ʹ 30ʺ, so that\r\nthe action of the sun and of the satellites themselves produces a\r\nnutation and precession (N. 91) in his equator, precisely similar to\r\nthat which takes place in the rotation of the earth, from the action of\r\nthe sun and moon. Hence the protuberant matter at Jupiter’s equator is\r\ncontinually changing its position with regard to the satellites, and\r\nproduces corresponding mutations in their motions. And, as the cause\r\nmust be proportional to the effect, these inequalities afford the means,\r\nnot only of ascertaining the compression of Jupiter’s spheroid, but they\r\nprove that his mass is not homogeneous. Although the apparent diameters\r\nof the satellites are too small to be measured, yet their perturbations\r\ngive the values of their masses with considerable accuracy—a striking\r\nproof of the power of analysis.\r\n\r\nA singular law obtains among the mean motions and mean longitudes of the\r\nfirst three satellites. It appears from observation that the mean motion\r\nof the first satellite, plus twice that of the third, is equal to three\r\ntimes that of the second; and that the mean longitude of the first\r\nsatellite, minus three times that of the second, plus twice that of the\r\nthird, is always equal to two right angles. It is proved by theory,\r\nthat, if these relations had only been approximate when the satellites\r\nwere first launched into space, their mutual attractions would have\r\nestablished and maintained them, notwithstanding the secular\r\ninequalities to which they are liable. They extend to the synodic\r\nmotions (N. 92) of the satellites; consequently they affect their\r\neclipses, and have a very great influence on their whole theory. The\r\nsatellites move so nearly in the plane of Jupiter’s equator, which has a\r\nvery small inclination to his orbit, that the first three are eclipsed\r\nat each revolution by the shadow of the planet, which is much larger\r\nthan the shadow of the moon: the fourth satellite is not eclipsed so\r\nfrequently as the others. The eclipses take place close to the disc of\r\nJupiter when he is near opposition (N. 93); but at times his shadow is\r\nso projected with regard to the earth, that the third and fourth\r\nsatellites vanish and reappear on the same side of the disc (N. 94).\r\nThese eclipses are in all respects similar to those of the moon: but,\r\noccasionally, the satellites eclipse Jupiter, sometimes passing like\r\nobscure spots across his surface, resembling annular eclipses of the\r\nsun, and sometimes like a bright spot traversing one of his dark belts.\r\nBefore opposition, the shadow of the satellite, like a round black spot,\r\nprecedes its passage over the disc of the planet; and, after opposition,\r\nthe shadow follows the satellite.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the relations already mentioned in the mean motions\r\nand mean longitudes of the first three satellites, they never can be all\r\neclipsed at the same time: for, when the second and third are in one\r\ndirection, the first is in the opposite direction; consequently, when\r\nthe first is eclipsed, the other two must be between the sun and\r\nJupiter. The instant of the beginning or end of an eclipse of a\r\nsatellite marks the same instant of absolute time to all the inhabitants\r\nof the earth; therefore, the time of these eclipses observed by a\r\ntraveller, when compared with the time of the eclipse computed for\r\nGreenwich, or any other fixed meridian (N. 95), gives the difference of\r\nthe meridians in time, and, consequently, the longitude of the place of\r\nobservation. The longitude is determined with extreme precision whenever\r\nit is possible to convey the time instantaneously by means of\r\nelectricity from one place to another, since it obviates the errors of\r\nclocks and chronometers. The eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites have been\r\nthe means of a discovery which, though not so immediately applicable to\r\nthe wants of man, unfolds one of the properties of light—that medium\r\nwithout whose cheering influence all the beauties of the creation would\r\nhave been to us a blank. It is observed, that those eclipses of the\r\nfirst satellite which happen when Jupiter is near conjunction (N. 96),\r\nare later by 16ʹ 26ʺ·6 than those which take place when the planet is in\r\nopposition. As Jupiter is nearer to us when in opposition by the whole\r\nbreadth of the earth’s orbit than when in conjunction, this circumstance\r\nis to be attributed to the time employed by the rays of light in\r\ncrossing the earth’s orbit, a distance of about 190,000,000 of miles;\r\nwhence it is estimated that light travels at the rate of 192,000 miles\r\nin one second. Such is its velocity, that the earth, moving at the rate\r\nof nineteen miles in a second, would take two months to pass through a\r\ndistance which a ray of light would dart over in eight minutes. The\r\nsubsequent discovery of the aberration of light has fully confirmed this\r\nastonishing result.\r\n\r\nObjects appear to be situate in the direction of the rays which proceed\r\nfrom them. Were light propagated instantaneously, every object, whether\r\nat rest or in motion, would appear in the direction of these rays; but,\r\nas light takes some time to travel, we see Jupiter in conjunction, by\r\nmeans of rays that left him 16^m 26^s·6 before; but, during that time,\r\nwe have changed our position, in consequence of the motion of the earth\r\nin its orbit: we therefore refer Jupiter to a place in which he is not.\r\nHis true position is in the diagonal (N. 97) of the parallelogram, whose\r\nsides are in the ratio of the velocity of light to the velocity of the\r\nearth in its orbit, which is as 192,000 to 19, or nearly as 10,000 to 1.\r\nIn consequence of the aberration of light, the heavenly bodies seem to\r\nbe in places in which they are not. In fact, if the earth were at rest,\r\nrays from a star would pass along the axis of a telescope directed to\r\nit; but, if the earth were to begin to move in its orbit with its usual\r\nvelocity, these rays would strike against the side of the tube; it\r\nwould, therefore, be necessary to incline the telescope a little, in\r\norder to see the star. The angle contained between the axis of the\r\ntelescope and a line drawn to the true place of the star is its\r\naberration, which varies in quantity and direction in different parts of\r\nthe earth’s orbit; but, as it is only 20ʺ·481, it is insensible in\r\nordinary cases (N. 98).\r\n\r\nThe velocity of light deduced from the observed aberration of the fixed\r\nstars perfectly corresponds with that given by the eclipses of the first\r\nsatellite. The same result, obtained from sources so different, leaves\r\nnot a doubt of its truth. Many such beautiful coincidences, derived from\r\ncircumstances apparently the most unpromising and dissimilar, occur in\r\nphysical astronomy, and prove connections which we might otherwise be\r\nunable to trace. The identity of the velocity of light, at the distance\r\nof Jupiter, and on the earth’s surface, shows that its velocity is\r\nuniform; and as light consists in the vibrations of an elastic medium or\r\nether filling space, the uniformity of its velocity shows that the\r\ndensity of the medium throughout the whole extent of the solar system\r\nmust be proportional to its elasticity (N. 99). Among the fortunate\r\nconjectures which have been confirmed by subsequent experience, that of\r\nBacon is not the least remarkable, “It produces in me,” says the\r\nrestorer of true philosophy, “a doubt whether the face of the serene and\r\nstarry heavens be seen at the instant it really exists, or not till some\r\ntime later: and whether there be not, with respect to the heavenly\r\nbodies, a true time and an apparent time, no less than a true place and\r\nan apparent place, as astronomers say, on account of parallax. For it\r\nseems incredible that the species or rays of the celestial bodies can\r\npass through the immense interval between them and us in an instant, or\r\nthat they do not even require some considerable portion of time.”\r\n\r\nGreat discoveries generally lead to a variety of conclusions: the\r\naberration of light affords a direct proof of the motion of the earth in\r\nits orbit; and its rotation is proved by the theory of falling bodies,\r\nsince the centrifugal force it induces retards the oscillations of the\r\npendulum (N. 100) in going from the pole to the equator. Thus a high\r\ndegree of scientific knowledge has been requisite to dispel the errors\r\nof the senses (N. 237).\r\n\r\nThe little that is known of the theories of the satellites of Saturn and\r\nUranus is, in all respects, similar to that of Jupiter. Saturn is\r\naccompanied by eight satellites. The seventh is about the size of Mars,\r\nand the eighth was simultaneously discovered by Mr. Bond in America, and\r\nthat distinguished astronomer Mr. Lassell, of Liverpool. The orbits of\r\nthe two last have a sensible inclination to the plane of the ring; but\r\nthe great compression of Saturn occasions the other satellites to move\r\nnearly in the plane of his equator. So many circumstances must concur to\r\nrender the two interior satellites visible, that they have very rarely\r\nbeen seen. They move exactly at the edge of the ring, and their orbits\r\nnever deviate from its plane. In 1789 Sir William Herschel saw them like\r\nbeads, threading the slender line of light which the ring is reduced to\r\nwhen seen edgewise from the earth. And for a short time he perceived\r\nthem advancing off it at each end, when turning round in their orbits.\r\nThe eclipses of the exterior satellites only take place when the ring is\r\nin this position. Mr. Lassell, with a powerful telescope, made by\r\nhimself, has seen Iapetus, the nearest of the two, on several occasions,\r\neven when the opening of the ring was very wide, which made it extremely\r\ndifficult to see so minute an object. Of the situation of the equator of\r\nUranus we know nothing, nor of his compression; but the orbits of his\r\nsatellites are nearly perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic; and,\r\nby analogy, they ought to be in the plane of his equator. Uranus is so\r\nremote that he has more the appearance of a planetary nebula than a\r\nplanet, which renders it extremely difficult to distinguish the\r\nsatellites at all; and quite hopeless without such a telescope as is\r\nrarely to be met with even in observatories. Sir William Herschel\r\ndiscovered the two that are farthest from the planet, and ascertained\r\ntheir approximate periods, which his son afterwards determined to be\r\n13^d 11^h 7^m 12^s·6 and 8^d 16^h 56^m 28^s·6 respectively. The\r\norbits of both seem to have an inclination of about 101°·2 to the plane\r\nof the ecliptic. The two interior satellites are so faint and small, and\r\nso near the edge of the planet, that they can with difficulty be seen\r\neven under the most favourable circumstances: however, Mr. Lassell has\r\nascertained that the more distant of the two revolves about Uranus in 4\r\ndays, and that nearest to the planet in 2-1/2 days, and from a long and\r\nminute examination he is convinced that the system only consists of four\r\nsatellites. Soon after Neptune was seen Mr. Lassell discovered the only\r\nsatellite known to belong to that planet. The satellites of Uranus and\r\nNeptune, the two planets on the remotest verge of the solar system,\r\noffer the singular and only instance of a revolution from east to west,\r\nwhile all the planets and all the other satellites revolve from west to\r\neast. Retrograde motion is occasionally met with in the comets and\r\ndouble stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SECTION V.\r\n\r\nLunar Theory—Periodic Perturbations of the Moon—Equation of\r\n  Centre—Evection—Variation—Annual Equation—Direct and Indirect\r\n  Action of Planets—The Moon’s Action on the Earth disturbs her\r\n  own Motion—Excentricity and Inclination of Lunar Orbit\r\n  invariable—Acceleration—Secular Variation in Nodes and\r\n  Perigee—Motion of Nodes and Perigee inseparably connected with\r\n  the Acceleration—Nutation of Lunar Orbit—Form and Internal\r\n  Structure of the Earth determined from it—Lunar, Solar, and\r\n  Planetary Eclipses—Occultations and Lunar Distances—Mean\r\n  Distance of the Sun from the Earth obtained from Lunar\r\n  Theory—Absolute Distances of the Planets, how found.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR constant companion, the moon, next claims our attention. Several\r\ncircumstances concur to render her motions the most interesting, and at\r\nthe same time the most difficult to investigate, of all the bodies of\r\nour system. In the solar system, planet troubles planet; but, in the\r\nlunar theory, the sun is the great disturbing cause, his vast distance\r\nbeing compensated by his enormous magnitude, so that the motions of the\r\nmoon are more irregular than those of the planets; and, on account of\r\nthe great ellipticity of her orbit, and the size of the sun, the\r\napproximations to her motions are tedious and difficult, beyond what\r\nthose unaccustomed to such investigations could imagine. The average\r\ndistance of the moon from the centre of the earth is only 238,793 miles,\r\nso that her motion among the stars is perceptible in a few hours. She\r\ncompletes a circuit of the heavens in 27^d 7^h 43^m 11^s·5, moving\r\nin an orbit whose excentricity is about 12,985 miles. The moon is about\r\nfour hundred times nearer to the earth than the sun. The proximity of\r\nthe moon to the earth keeps them together. For so great is the\r\nattraction of the sun, that, if the moon were farther from the earth,\r\nshe would leave it altogether, and would revolve as an independent\r\nplanet about the sun.\r\n\r\nThe disturbing action (N. 101) of the sun on the moon is equivalent to\r\nthree forces. The first, acting in the direction of the line joining the\r\nmoon and earth, increases or diminishes her gravity to the earth. The\r\nsecond, acting in the direction of a tangent to her orbit, disturbs her\r\nmotion in longitude. And the third, acting perpendicularly to the plane\r\nof her orbit, disturbs her motion in latitude; that is, it brings her\r\nnearer to, or removes her farther from, the plane of the ecliptic than\r\nshe would otherwise be. The periodic perturbations in the moon, arising\r\nfrom these forces, are perfectly similar to the periodic perturbations\r\nof the planets. But they are much greater and more numerous; because the\r\nsun is so large, that many inequalities which are quite insensible in\r\nthe motions of the planets, are of great magnitude in those of the moon.\r\nAmong the innumerable periodic inequalities to which the moon’s motion\r\nin longitude is liable, the most remarkable are, the Equation of the\r\nCentre, which is the difference between the moon’s mean and true\r\nlongitude, the Evection, the Variation, and the Annual Equation. The\r\ndisturbing force which acts in the line joining the moon and earth\r\nproduces the Evection: it diminishes the excentricity of the lunar orbit\r\nin conjunction and opposition, thereby making it more circular, and\r\naugments it in quadrature, which consequently renders it more\r\nelliptical. The period of this inequality is less than thirty-two days.\r\nWere the increase and diminution always the same, the Evection would\r\nonly depend upon the distance of the moon from the sun; but its absolute\r\nvalue also varies with her distance from the perigee (N. 102) of her\r\norbit. Ancient astronomers, who observed the moon solely with a view to\r\nthe prediction of eclipses, which can only happen in conjunction and\r\nopposition, where the excentricity is diminished by the Evection,\r\nassigned too small a value to the ellipticity of her orbit (N. 103). The\r\nEvection was discovered by Ptolemy from observation, about A.D. 140. The\r\nVariation produced by the tangential disturbing force, which is at its\r\nmaximum when the moon is 45° distant from the sun, vanishes when that\r\ndistance amounts to a quadrant, and also when the moon is in conjunction\r\nand opposition; consequently, that inequality never could have been\r\ndiscovered from the eclipses: its period is half a lunar month (N. 104).\r\nThe Annual Equation depends upon the sun’s distance from the earth: it\r\narises from the moon’s motion being accelerated when that of the earth\r\nis retarded, and _vice versâ_—for, when the earth is in its perihelion,\r\nthe lunar orbit is enlarged by the action of the sun; therefore, the\r\nmoon requires more time to perform her revolution. But, as the earth\r\napproaches its aphelion, the moon’s orbit contracts, and less time is\r\nnecessary to accomplish her motion—its period, consequently, depends\r\nupon the time of the year. In the eclipses the Annual Equation combines\r\nwith the Equation of the Centre of the terrestrial orbit, so that\r\nancient astronomers imagined the earth’s orbit to have a greater\r\nexcentricity than modern astronomers assign to it.\r\n\r\nThe planets disturb the motion of the moon both directly and indirectly;\r\ntheir action on the earth alters its relative position with regard to\r\nthe sun and moon, and occasions inequalities in the moon’s motion, which\r\nare more considerable than those arising from their direct action; for\r\nthe same reason the moon, by disturbing the earth, indirectly disturbs\r\nher own motion. Neither the excentricity of the lunar orbit, nor its\r\nmean inclination to the plane of the ecliptic, have experienced any\r\nchanges from secular inequalities; for, although the mean action of the\r\nsun on the moon depends upon the inclination of the lunar orbit to the\r\necliptic, and the position of the ecliptic is subject to a secular\r\ninequality, yet analysis shows that it does not occasion a secular\r\nvariation in the inclination of the lunar orbit, because the action of\r\nthe sun constantly brings the moon’s orbit to the same inclination to\r\nthe ecliptic. The mean motion, the nodes, and the perigee, however, are\r\nsubject to very remarkable variations.\r\n\r\nFrom the eclipse observed at Babylon, on the 19th of March, seven\r\nhundred and twenty-one years before the Christian era, the place of the\r\nmoon is known from that of the sun at the instant of opposition (N. 83),\r\nwhence her mean longitude may be found. But the comparison of this mean\r\nlongitude with another mean longitude, computed back for the instant of\r\nthe eclipse from modern observations, shows that the moon performs her\r\nrevolution round the earth more rapidly and in a shorter time now than\r\nshe did formerly, and that the acceleration in her mean motion has been\r\nincreasing from age to age as the square of the time (N. 105). All\r\nancient and intermediate eclipses confirm this result. As the mean\r\nmotions of the planets have no secular inequalities, this seemed to be\r\nan unaccountable anomaly. It was at one time attributed to the\r\nresistance of an ethereal medium pervading space, and at another to the\r\nsuccessive transmission of the gravitating force. But, as La Place\r\nproved that neither of these causes, even if they exist, have any\r\ninfluence on the motions of the lunar perigee (N. 102) or nodes, they\r\ncould not affect the mean motion; a variation in the mean motion from\r\nsuch causes being inseparably connected with variations in the motions\r\nof the perigee and nodes. That great mathematician, in studying the\r\ntheory of Jupiter’s satellites, perceived that the secular variation in\r\nthe elements of Jupiter’s orbit, from the action of the planets,\r\noccasions corresponding changes in the motions of the satellites, which\r\nled him to suspect that the acceleration in the mean motion of the moon\r\nmight be connected with the secular variation in the excentricity of the\r\nterrestrial orbit. Analysis has shown that he assigned the true cause of\r\nthe acceleration.\r\n\r\nIt is proved that the greater the excentricity of the terrestrial orbit,\r\nthe greater is the disturbing action of the sun on the moon. Now, as the\r\nexcentricity has been decreasing for ages, the effect of the sun in\r\ndisturbing the moon has been diminishing during that time. Consequently\r\nthe attraction of the earth has had a more and more powerful effect on\r\nthe moon, and has been continually diminishing the size of the lunar\r\norbit. So that the moon’s velocity has been gradually augmenting for\r\nmany centuries to balance the increase of the earth’s attraction. This\r\nsecular increase in the moon’s velocity is called the Acceleration, a\r\nname peculiarly appropriate at present, and which will continue to be so\r\nfor a vast number of ages; because, as long as the earth’s excentricity\r\ndiminishes, the moon’s mean motion will be accelerated; but when the\r\nexcentricity has passed its minimum, and begins to increase, the mean\r\nmotion will be retarded from age to age. The secular acceleration is now\r\nabout 11ʺ·9, but its effect on the moon’s place increases as the square\r\nof the time (N. 106). It is remarkable that the action of the planets,\r\nthus reflected by the sun to the moon, is much more sensible than their\r\ndirect action either on the earth or moon. The secular diminution in the\r\nexcentricity, which has not altered the equation of the centre of the\r\nsun by eight minutes since the earliest recorded eclipses, has produced\r\na variation of about 1° 48ʹ in the moon’s longitude, and of 7° 12ʹ in\r\nher mean anomaly (N. 107).\r\n\r\nThe action of the sun occasions a rapid but variable motion in the nodes\r\nand perigee of the lunar orbit. Though the nodes recede during the\r\ngreater part of the moon’s revolution, and advance during the smaller,\r\nthey perform their sidereal revolution in 6793^d 9^h 23^m 9^s·3, or\r\nabout 18-6/10 years; and the perigee accomplishes a revolution, called\r\nof the moon’s apsides, in 3232^d 13^h 48^m 29^s·6, or a little more\r\nthan nine years, notwithstanding its motion is sometimes retrograde and\r\nsometimes direct: but such is the difference between the disturbing\r\nenergy of the sun and that of all the planets put together, that it\r\nrequires no less than 109,830 years for the greater axis of the\r\nterrestrial orbit to do the same, moving at the rate of 11ʺ·8 annually.\r\nThe form of the earth has no sensible effect either on the lunar nodes\r\nor apsides. It is evident that the same secular variation which changes\r\nthe sun’s distance from the earth, and occasions the acceleration in the\r\nmoon’s mean motion, must affect the nodes and perigee. It consequently\r\nappears, from theory as well as observation, that both these elements\r\nare subject to a secular inequality, arising from the variation in the\r\nexcentricity of the earth’s orbit, which connects them with the\r\nAcceleration, so that both are retarded when the mean motion is\r\nanticipated. The secular variations in these three elements are in the\r\nratio of the numbers 3, 0·735, and 1; whence the three motions of the\r\nmoon, with regard to the sun, to her perigee, and to her nodes, are\r\ncontinually accelerated, and their secular equations are as the numbers\r\n1, 4·702, and 0·612. A comparison of ancient eclipses observed by the\r\nArabs, Greeks, and Chaldeans, imperfect as they are, with modern\r\nobservations, confirms these results of analysis. Future ages will\r\ndevelop these great inequalities, which at some most distant period will\r\namount to many circumferences (N. 108). They are, indeed, periodic; but\r\nwho shall tell their period? Millions of years must elapse before that\r\ngreat cycle is accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe moon is so near, that the excess of matter at the earth’s equator\r\noccasions periodic variations in her longitude, and also that remarkable\r\ninequality in her latitude, already mentioned as a nutation in the lunar\r\norbit, which diminishes its inclination to the ecliptic when the moon’s\r\nascending node coincides with the equinox of spring, and augments it\r\nwhen that node coincides with the equinox of autumn. As the cause must\r\nbe proportional to the effect, a comparison of these inequalities,\r\ncomputed from theory, with the same given by observation, shows that the\r\ncompression of the terrestrial spheroid, or the ratio of the difference\r\nbetween the polar and the equatorial diameters, to the diameter of the\r\nequator, is 1/305·05. It is proved analytically, that, if a fluid mass\r\nof homogeneous matter, whose particles attract each other inversely as\r\nthe squares of the distance, were to revolve about an axis as the earth\r\ndoes, it would assume the form of a spheroid whose compression is 1/230.\r\nSince that is not the case, the earth cannot be homogeneous, but must\r\ndecrease in density from its centre to its circumference. Thus the\r\nmoon’s eclipses show the earth to be round; and her inequalities not\r\nonly determine the form, but even the internal structure of our planet;\r\nresults of analysis which could not have been anticipated. Similar\r\ninequalities in the motions of Jupiter’s satellites prove that his mass\r\nis not homogeneous, and that his compression is 1/13·8. His equatorial\r\ndiameter exceeds his polar diameter by about 6000 miles.\r\n\r\nThe phases (N. 109) of the moon, which vary from a slender silvery\r\ncrescent soon after conjunction, to a complete circular disc of light in\r\nopposition, decrease by the same degrees till the moon is again\r\nenveloped in the morning beams of the sun. These changes regulate the\r\nreturns of the eclipses. Those of the sun can only happen in\r\nconjunction, when the moon, coming between the earth and the sun,\r\nintercepts his light. Those of the moon are occasioned by the earth\r\nintervening between the sun and moon when in opposition. As the earth is\r\nopaque and nearly spherical, it throws a conical shadow on the side of\r\nthe moon opposite to the sun, the axis of which passes through the\r\ncentres of the sun and earth (N. 110). The length of the shadow\r\nterminates at the point where the apparent diameters (N. 111) of the sun\r\nand earth would be the same. When the moon is in opposition, and at her\r\nmean distance, the diameter of the sun would be seen from her centre\r\nunder an angle of 1918ʺ·1. That of the earth would appear under an angle\r\nof 6908ʺ·3. So that the length of the shadow is at least three times and\r\na half greater than the distance of the moon from the earth, and the\r\nbreadth of the shadow, where it is traversed by the moon, is about\r\neight-thirds of the lunar diameter. Hence the moon would be eclipsed\r\nevery time she is in opposition, were it not for the inclination of her\r\norbit to the plane of the ecliptic, in consequence of which the moon,\r\nwhen in opposition, is either above or below the cone of the earth’s\r\nshadow, except when in or near her nodes. Her position with regard to\r\nthem occasions all the varieties in the lunar eclipses. Every point of\r\nthe moon’s surface successively loses the light of different parts of\r\nthe sun’s disc before being eclipsed. Her brightness therefore gradually\r\ndiminishes before she plunges into the earth’s shadow. The breadth of\r\nthe space occupied by the penumbra (N. 112) is equal to the apparent\r\ndiameter of the sun, as seen from the centre of the moon. The mean\r\nduration of a revolution of the sun, with regard to the node of the\r\nlunar orbit, is to the duration of a synodic revolution (N. 113) of the\r\nmoon as 223 to 19. So that, after a period of 223 lunar months, the sun\r\nand moon would return to the same relative position with regard to the\r\nnode of the moon’s orbit, and therefore the eclipses would recur in the\r\nsame order were not the periods altered by irregularities in the motions\r\nof the sun and moon. In lunar eclipses, our atmosphere bends the sun’s\r\nrays which pass through it all round into the cone of the earth’s\r\nshadow. And as the horizontal refraction (N. 114) or bending of the rays\r\nsurpasses half the sum of the semidiameters of the sun and moon, divided\r\nby their mutual distance, the centre of the lunar disc, supposed to be\r\nin the axis of the shadow, would receive the rays from the same point of\r\nthe sun, round all sides of the earth; so that it would be more\r\nilluminated than in full moon, if the greater portion of the light were\r\nnot stopped or absorbed by the atmosphere. Instances are recorded where\r\nthis feeble light has been entirely absorbed, so that the moon has\r\naltogether disappeared in her eclipses.\r\n\r\nThe sun is eclipsed when the moon intercepts his rays (N. 115). The\r\nmoon, though incomparably smaller than the sun, is so much nearer the\r\nearth, that her apparent diameter differs but little from his, but both\r\nare liable to such variations that they alternately surpass one another.\r\nWere the eye of a spectator in the same straight line with the centres\r\nof the sun and moon, he would see the sun eclipsed. If the apparent\r\ndiameter of the moon surpassed that of the sun, the eclipse would be\r\ntotal. If it were less, the observer would see a ring of light round the\r\ndisc of the moon, and the eclipse would be annular, as it was on the\r\n17th of May, 1836, and on the 15th of March, 1858. If the centre of the\r\nmoon should not be in the straight line joining the centres of the sun\r\nand the eye of the observer, the moon might only eclipse a part of the\r\nsun. The variation, therefore, in the distances of the sun and moon from\r\nthe centre of the earth, and of the moon from her node at the instant of\r\nconjunction, occasions great varieties in the solar eclipses. Besides,\r\nthe height of the moon above the horizon changes her apparent diameter,\r\nand may augment or diminish the apparent distances of the centres of the\r\nsun and moon, so that an eclipse of the sun may occur to the inhabitants\r\nof one country, and not to those of another. In this respect the solar\r\neclipses differ from the lunar, which are the same for every part of the\r\nearth where the moon is above the horizon. In solar eclipses, the light\r\nreflected by the atmosphere diminishes the obscurity they produce. Even\r\nin total eclipses the higher part of the atmosphere is enlightened by a\r\npart of the sun’s disc, and reflects its rays to the earth. The whole\r\ndisc of the new moon is frequently visible from atmospheric reflection.\r\nDuring the eclipse of the 19th of March, 1849, the spots on the lunar\r\ndisc were distinctly visible, and during that of 1856 the moon was like\r\na beautiful rose-coloured ball floating in the ether: the colour is\r\nowing to the refraction of the sun’s light passing through the earth’s\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn total solar eclipses the slender luminous arc that is visible for a\r\nfew seconds before the sun vanishes and also before he reappears,\r\nresembles a string of pearls surrounding the dark edge of the moon; it\r\nis occasioned by the sun’s rays passing between the tops of the lunar\r\nmountains: it occurs likewise in annular eclipses.\r\n\r\nA phenomenon altogether unprecedented was seen during the total eclipse\r\nof the sun which happened on the 8th of July, 1842. The moon was like a\r\nblack patch on the sky surrounded by a faint whitish light or corona\r\nabout the eighth of the moon’s diameter in breadth, which is supposed to\r\nbe the solar atmosphere rendered visible by the intervention of the\r\nmoon. In this whitish corona there appeared three rose-coloured flames\r\nlike the teeth of a saw. Similar flames were also seen in the white\r\ncorona of the total eclipse which took place in 1851, and a long\r\nrose-coloured chain of what appeared to be jagged mountains or sierras\r\nunited at the base by a red band seemed to be raised into the corona by\r\nmirage; but there is no doubt that the corona and red phenomena belong\r\nto the sun. This red chain was so bright that Mr. Airy saw it illuminate\r\nthe northern horizon through an azimuth of 90° with red light. M. Faye\r\nattributes the rose-coloured protuberances to the constitution of the\r\nsun, which, like Sir William Herschel, he conceives to be an\r\nincandescent globe, consisting of two concentric parts of very unequal\r\ndensity, the internal part being a dark spherical mass, the external a\r\nvery extensive atmosphere, at a certain height in which there is a\r\nstratum of luminous clouds which constitutes the photosphere of the sun;\r\nabove this rises his real atmosphere, so rare as to be only visible as a\r\nwhite aureola or corona during total and annular eclipses. M. Faye\r\nconceives that from the central mass gaseous eruptions issue, which form\r\nthe spots by dissipating and partly extinguishing the luminous clouds,\r\nand then rising into the rare atmosphere above that they appear as\r\nrose-coloured protuberances during annular eclipses. He estimates that\r\nthe volume of these vapours sometimes surpasses that of the earth a\r\nthousand or even two thousand times. Sir William Herschel attributed the\r\nspots to occasional openings in the luminous coating, which seems to be\r\nalways in motion; but whatever the cause of the spots may be, it is\r\ncertainly periodical. The white corona and beads were seen during the\r\neclipse of the 15th March, 1858, but there were no rose-coloured\r\nappearances, in England at least; but the sky was clouded, so that the\r\neclipse was only visible at intervals.\r\n\r\nPlanets sometimes eclipse one another. On the 17th of May, 1737, Mercury\r\nwas eclipsed by Venus near their inferior conjunction; Mars passed over\r\nJupiter on the 9th of January, 1591; and on the 30th of October, 1825,\r\nthe moon eclipsed Saturn. These phenomena, however, happen very seldom,\r\nbecause all the planets, or even a part of them, are very rarely seen in\r\nconjunction at once; that is, in the same part of the heavens at the\r\nsame time. More than 2500 years before our era the five great planets\r\nwere in conjunction. On the 15th of September, 1186, a similar\r\nassemblage took place between the constellations of Virgo and Libra; and\r\nin 1801 the Moon, Jupiter, Saturn, and Venus were united in the heart of\r\nthe Lion. These conjunctions are so rare, that Lalande has computed that\r\nmore than seventeen millions of millions of years separate the epochs of\r\nthe contemporaneous conjunctions of the six great planets.\r\n\r\nThe motions of the moon have now become of more importance to the\r\nnavigator and geographer than those of any other heavenly body, from the\r\nprecision with which terrestrial longitude is determined by occultations\r\nof stars, and by lunar distances. In consequence of the retrograde\r\nmotion of the nodes of the lunar orbit, at the rate of 3ʹ 10ʺ·64 daily,\r\nthese points make a tour of the heavens in a little more than eighteen\r\nyears and a half. This causes the moon to move round the earth in a kind\r\nof spiral, so that her disc at different times passes over every point\r\nin a zone of the heavens extending rather more than 5° 9ʹ on each side\r\nof the ecliptic. It is therefore evident that at one time or other she\r\nmust eclipse every star and planet she meets with in this space.\r\nTherefore the occultation of a star by the moon is a phenomenon of\r\nfrequent occurrence. The moon seems to pass over the star, which almost\r\ninstantaneously vanishes at one side of her disc, and after a short time\r\nas suddenly reappears on the other. A lunar distance is the observed\r\ndistance of the moon from the sun, or from a particular star or planet,\r\nat any instant. The lunar theory is brought to such perfection, that the\r\ntimes of these phenomena, observed under any meridian, when compared\r\nwith those computed for that of Greenwich, and given in the Nautical\r\nAlmanac, furnish the longitude of the observer within a few miles\r\n(N. 95.)\r\n\r\nFrom the lunar theory, the mean distance of the sun from the earth, and\r\nthence the whole dimensions of the solar system, are known; for the\r\nforces which retain the earth and moon in their orbits are respectively\r\nproportional to the radii vectores of the earth and moon, each being\r\ndivided by the square of its periodic time. And, as the lunar theory\r\ngives the ratio of the forces, the ratio of the distances of the sun and\r\nmoon from the earth is obtained. Hence it appears that the sun’s mean\r\ndistance from the earth is 399·7 or nearly 400 times greater than that\r\nof the moon. The method of finding the absolute distances of the\r\ncelestial bodies, in miles, is in fact the same with that employed in\r\nmeasuring the distances of terrestrial objects. From the extremities of\r\na known base (N. 116), the angles which the visual rays from the object\r\nform with it are measured; their sum subtracted from two right angles\r\ngives the angle opposite the base; therefore, by trigonometry, all the\r\nangles and sides of the triangle may be computed—consequently the\r\ndistance of the object is found. The angle under which the base of the\r\ntriangle is seen from the object is the parallax of that object. It\r\nevidently increases and decreases with the distance. Therefore the base\r\nmust be very great indeed to be visible from the celestial bodies. The\r\nglobe itself, whose dimensions are obtained by actual admeasurement,\r\nfurnishes a standard of measures with which we compare the distances,\r\nmasses, densities, and volumes of the sun and planets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION VI.\r\n\r\nForm of the Earth and Planets—Figure of a Homogeneous Spheroid in\r\n  Rotation—Figure of a Spheroid of variable Density—Figure of the Earth,\r\n  supposing it to be an Ellipsoid of Revolution—Mensuration of a Degree\r\n  of the Meridian—Compression and Size of the Earth from Degrees of\r\n  Meridian—Figure of Earth from the Pendulum.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE theoretical investigation of the figure of the earth and planets is\r\nso complicated, that neither the geometry of Newton, nor the refined\r\nanalysis of La Place, has attained more than an approximation. The\r\nsolution of that difficult problem has been accomplished by our\r\ndistinguished countryman Mr. Ivory. The investigation has been conducted\r\nby successive steps, beginning with a simple case, and then proceeding\r\nto the more difficult. But, in all, the forces which occasion the\r\nrevolutions of the earth and planets are omitted, because, by acting\r\nequally upon all the particles, they do not disturb their mutual\r\nrelations. A fluid mass of uniform density, whose particles mutually\r\ngravitate to each other, will assume the form of a sphere when at rest.\r\nBut, if the sphere begins to revolve, every particle will describe a\r\ncircle (N. 117), having its centre in the axis of revolution. The planes\r\nof all these circles will be parallel to one another and perpendicular\r\nto the axis, and the particles will have a tendency to fly from that\r\naxis in consequence of the centrifugal force arising from the velocity\r\nof rotation. The force of gravity is everywhere perpendicular to the\r\nsurface (N. 118), and tends to the interior of the fluid mass; whereas\r\nthe centrifugal force acts perpendicularly to the axis of rotation, and\r\nis directed to the exterior. And, as its intensity diminishes with the\r\ndistance from the axis of rotation, it decreases from the equator to the\r\npoles, where it ceases. Now it is clear that these two forces are in\r\ndirect opposition to each other in the equator alone, and that gravity\r\nis there diminished by the whole effect of the centrifugal force,\r\nwhereas, in every other part of the fluid, the centrifugal force is\r\nresolved into two parts, one of which, being perpendicular to the\r\nsurface, diminishes the force of gravity; but the other, being at a\r\ntangent to the surface, urges the particles towards the equator, where\r\nthey accumulate till their numbers compensate the diminution of gravity,\r\nwhich makes the mass bulge at the equator, and become flattened at the\r\npoles. It appears, then, that the influence of the centrifugal force is\r\nmost powerful at the equator, not only because it is actually greater\r\nthere than elsewhere, but because its whole effect is employed in\r\ndiminishing gravity, whereas, in every other point of the fluid mass, it\r\nis only a part that is so employed. For both these reasons, it gradually\r\ndecreases towards the poles, where it ceases. On the contrary, gravity\r\nis least at the equator, because the particles are farther from the\r\ncentre of the mass, and increases towards the poles, where it is\r\ngreatest. It is evident, therefore, that, as the centrifugal force is\r\nmuch less than the force of gravity—gravitation, which is the difference\r\nbetween the two, is least at the equator, and continually increases\r\ntowards the poles, where it is a maximum. On these principles Sir Isaac\r\nNewton proved that a homogeneous fluid (N. 119) mass in rotation assumes\r\nthe form of an ellipsoid of revolution (N. 120), whose compression is\r\n1/230. Such, however, cannot be the form of the earth, because the\r\nstrata increase in density towards the centre. The lunar inequalities\r\nalso prove the earth to be so constructed; it was requisite, therefore,\r\nto consider the fluid mass to be of variable density. Including this\r\ncondition, it has been found that the mass, when in rotation, would\r\nstill assume the form of an ellipsoid of revolution (N. 120); that the\r\nparticles of equal density would arrange themselves in concentric\r\nelliptical strata (N. 121), the most dense being in the centre; but that\r\nthe compression or flattening would be less than in the case of the\r\nhomogeneous fluid. The compression is still less when the mass is\r\nconsidered to be, as it actually is, a solid nucleus, decreasing\r\nregularly in density from the centre to the surface, and partially\r\ncovered by the ocean, because the solid parts, by their cohesion, nearly\r\ndestroy that part of the centrifugal force which gives the particles a\r\ntendency to accumulate at the equator, though not altogether; otherwise\r\nthe sea, by the superior mobility of its particles, would flow towards\r\nthe equator and leave the poles dry. Besides, it is well known that the\r\ncontinents at the equator are more elevated than they are in higher\r\nlatitudes. It is also necessary for the equilibrium of the ocean that\r\nits density should be less than the mean density of the earth, otherwise\r\nthe continents would be perpetually liable to inundations from storms\r\nand other causes. On the whole, it appears from theory, that a\r\nhorizontal line passing round the earth through both poles must be\r\nnearly an ellipse, having its major axis in the plane of the equator,\r\nand its minor axis coincident with the axis of the earth’s rotation\r\n(N. 122). It is easy to show, in a spheroid whose strata are elliptical,\r\nthat the increase in the length of the radii (N. 123), the decrease of\r\ngravitation, and the increase in the length of the arcs of the meridian,\r\ncorresponding to angles of one degree, from the poles to the equator,\r\nare all proportional to the square of the cosine of the latitude\r\n(N. 124). These quantities are so connected with the ellipticity of the\r\nspheroid, that the total increase in the length of the radii is equal to\r\nthe compression or flattening, and the total diminution in the length of\r\nthe arcs is equal to the compression, multiplied by three times the\r\nlength of an arc of one degree at the equator. Hence, by measuring the\r\nmeridian curvature of the earth, the compression, and consequently its\r\nfigure, become known. This, indeed, is assuming the earth to be an\r\nellipsoid of revolution; but the actual measurement of the globe will\r\nshow how far it corresponds with that solid in figure and constitution.\r\n\r\nThe courses of the great rivers, which are in general navigable to a\r\nconsiderable extent, prove that the curvature of the land differs but\r\nlittle from that of the ocean; and, as the heights of the mountains and\r\ncontinents are inconsiderable when compared with the magnitude of the\r\nearth, its figure is understood to be determined by a surface at every\r\npoint perpendicular to the direction of gravitation, or of the\r\nplumb-line, and is the same which the sea would have if it were\r\ncontinued all round the earth beneath the continents. Such is the figure\r\nthat has been measured in the following manner:—\r\n\r\nA terrestrial meridian is a line passing through both poles, all the\r\npoints of which have their noon contemporaneously. Were the lengths and\r\ncurvatures of different meridians known, the figure of the earth might\r\nbe determined. But the length of one degree is sufficient to give the\r\nfigure of the earth, if it be measured on different meridians, and in a\r\nvariety of latitudes. For, if the earth were a sphere, all degrees would\r\nbe of the same length; but, if not, the lengths of the degrees would be\r\ngreater, exactly in proportion as the curvature is less. A comparison of\r\nthe length of a degree in different parts of the earth’s surface will\r\ntherefore determine its size and form.\r\n\r\nAn arc of the meridian may be measured by determining the latitude of\r\nits extreme points by astronomical observations (N. 125), and then\r\nmeasuring the distance between them in feet or fathoms. The distance\r\nthus determined on the surface of the earth, divided by the degrees and\r\nparts of a degree contained in the difference of the latitudes, will\r\ngive the exact length of one degree, the difference of the latitudes\r\nbeing the angle contained between the verticals at the extremities of\r\nthe arc. This would be easily accomplished were the distance\r\nunobstructed and on a level with the sea. But, on account of the\r\ninnumerable obstacles on the surface of the earth, it is necessary to\r\nconnect the extreme points of the arc by a series of triangles (N. 126),\r\nthe sides and angles of which are either measured or computed, so that\r\nthe length of the arc is ascertained with much laborious calculation. In\r\nconsequence of the irregularities of the surface each triangle is in a\r\ndifferent plane. They must therefore be reduced by computation to what\r\nthey would have been had they been measured on the surface of the sea.\r\nAnd, as the earth may in this case be esteemed spherical, they require a\r\ncorrection to reduce them to spherical triangles. The officers who\r\nconducted the trigonometrical survey, in measuring 500 feet of a base in\r\nIreland twice over, found that the difference in the two measurements\r\ndid not amount to the 800th part of an inch; and in the General Survey\r\nof Great Britain, five bases were measured from 5 to 7 miles long, and\r\nsome of them 400 miles apart, yet, when connected by series of\r\ntriangles, the measured and computed lengths did not differ by more than\r\n3 inches, an unparalleled degree of accuracy; but such is the accuracy\r\nwith which these operations are conducted.\r\n\r\nArcs of the meridian have been measured in a variety of latitudes in\r\nboth hemispheres, as well as arcs perpendicular to the meridian. From\r\nthese measurements it appears that the length of the degrees increases\r\nfrom the equator to the poles, nearly in proportion to the square of the\r\nsine of the latitude (N. 127). Consequently, the convexity of the earth\r\ndiminishes from the equator to the poles.\r\n\r\nWere the earth an ellipsoid of revolution, the meridians would be\r\nellipses whose lesser axes would coincide with the axis of rotation, and\r\nall the degrees measured between the pole and the equator would give the\r\nsame compression when combined two and two. That, however, is far from\r\nbeing the case. Scarcely any of the measurements give exactly the same\r\nresults, chiefly on account of local attractions, which cause the\r\nplumb-line to deviate from the vertical. The vicinity of mountains\r\nproduces that effect. One of the most remarkable anomalies of this kind\r\nhas been observed in certain localities of northern Italy, where the\r\naction of some dense subterraneous matter causes the plumb-line to\r\ndeviate seven or eight times more than it did from the attraction of\r\nChimborazo, in the observations of Bouguer, while measuring a degree of\r\nthe meridian at the equator. In consequence of this local attraction,\r\nthe degrees of the meridian in that part of Italy seem to increase\r\ntowards the equator through a small space, instead of decreasing, as if\r\nthe earth was drawn out at the poles, instead of being flattened.\r\n\r\nMany other discrepancies occur, but from the mean of the five principal\r\nmeasurements of arcs in Peru, India, France, England, and Lapland, Mr.\r\nIvory has deduced that the figure which most nearly follows this law is\r\nan ellipsoid of revolution whose equatorial radius is 3962·824 miles,\r\nand the polar radius 3949·585 miles. The difference, or 13·239 miles,\r\ndivided by the equatorial radius, is 1/299 nearly[3] (N. 128). This\r\nfraction is called the compression of the earth, and does not differ\r\nmuch from that given by the lunar inequalities. Since the preceding\r\nquantities were determined, arcs of the meridian have been measured in\r\nvarious parts of the globe, of which the most extensive are the Russian\r\narc of 25° 20ʹ between the Glacial Sea and the Danube, conducted under\r\nthe superintendence of M. Struve, and the Indian arc extended to 21°\r\n21ʹ, by Colonel Everest. The compression deduced by Bessel from the sum\r\nof ten arcs is 298-3/4, the equatorial radius 3962·802, and the polar\r\n3949·554 miles, whilst Mr. Airy arrives at an almost identical result\r\n(3962·824, 3949·585, and 298-83/100) from a consideration of all the\r\narcs, measured up to 1831, including the great Indian and Russian ones.\r\nIf we assume the earth to be a sphere, the length of a degree of the\r\nmeridian is 69-14/100 English miles. Therefore 360 degrees, or the whole\r\nequatorial circumference of the globe, is 24,899 English miles.\r\nEratosthenes, who died 194 years before the Christian era, was the first\r\nto give an approximate value of the earth’s circumference, by the\r\nmeasurement of an arc between Alexandria and Syene.\r\n\r\nThere is another method of finding the figure of the earth, totally\r\ndifferent from the preceding, solely depending upon the increase of\r\ngravitation from the equator to the poles. The force of gravitation at\r\nany place is measured by the descent of a heavy body during the first\r\nsecond of its fall. And the intensity of the centrifugal force is\r\nmeasured by the deflection of any point from the tangent in a second.\r\nFor, since the centrifugal force balances the attraction of the earth,\r\nit is an exact measure of the gravitating force. Were the attraction to\r\ncease, a body on the surface of the earth would fly off in the tangent\r\nby the centrifugal force, instead of bending round in the circle of\r\nrotation. Therefore, the deflection of the circle from the tangent in a\r\nsecond measures the intensity of the earth’s attraction, and is equal to\r\nthe versed sine of the arc described during that time, a quantity easily\r\ndetermined from the known velocity of the earth’s rotation. Whence it\r\nhas been found that at the equator the centrifugal force is equal to the\r\n289th part of gravity. Now, it is proved by analysis that, whatever the\r\nconstitution of the earth and planets may be, if the intensity of\r\ngravitation at the equator be taken equal to unity, the sum of the\r\ncompression of the ellipsoid, and the whole increase of gravitation from\r\nthe equator to the pole, is equal to five halves of the ratio of the\r\ncentrifugal force to gravitation at the equator. This quantity with\r\nregard to the earth is 5/2 of 1/289 or 1/115·2. Consequently, the\r\ncompression of the earth is equal to 1/115·2 diminished by the whole\r\nincrease of gravitation. So that its form will be known, if the whole\r\nincrease of gravitation from the equator to the pole can be determined\r\nby experiment. This has been accomplished by a method founded upon the\r\nfollowing considerations:—If the earth were a homogeneous sphere without\r\nrotation, its attraction on bodies at its surface would be everywhere\r\nthe same. If it be elliptical and of variable density, the force of\r\ngravity, theoretically, ought to increase from the equator to the pole,\r\nas unity _plus_ a constant quantity multiplied into the square of the\r\nsine of the latitude (N. 127). But for a spheroid in rotation the\r\ncentrifugal force varies, by the laws of mechanics, as the square of the\r\nsine of the latitude, from the equator, where it is greatest, to the\r\npole, where it vanishes. And, as it tends to make bodies fly off the\r\nsurface, it diminishes the force of gravity by a small quantity. Hence,\r\nby gravitation, which is the difference of these two forces, the fall of\r\nbodies ought to be accelerated from the equator to the poles\r\nproportionably to the square of the sine of the latitude; and the weight\r\nof the same body ought to increase in that ratio. This is directly\r\nproved by the oscillations of the pendulum (N. 129), which, in fact, is\r\na falling body; for, if the fall of bodies be accelerated, the\r\noscillations will be more rapid: in order, therefore, that they may\r\nalways be performed in the same time, the length of the pendulum must be\r\naltered. By numerous and careful experiments it is proved that a\r\npendulum, which oscillates 86,400 times in a mean day at the equator,\r\nwill do the same at every point of the earth’s surface, if its length be\r\nincreased progressively to the pole, as the square of the sine of the\r\nlatitude.\r\n\r\nFrom the mean of these it appears that the whole decrease of gravitation\r\nfrom the poles to the equator is 0·0051449, which, subtracted from\r\n1/115·2, shows that the compression of the terrestrial spheroid is about\r\n1/285·26. This value has been deduced by the late Mr. Baily, president\r\nof the Astronomical Society, who devoted much attention to this subject;\r\nat the same time, it may be observed that no two sets of pendulum\r\nexperiments give the same result, probably from local attractions. The\r\ncompression obtained by this method does not differ much from that given\r\nby the lunar inequalities, nor from the arcs in the direction of the\r\nmeridian, and those perpendicular to it. The near coincidence of these\r\nthree values, deduced by methods so entirely independent of each other,\r\nshows that the mutual tendencies of the centres of the celestial bodies\r\nto one another, and the attraction of the earth for bodies at its\r\nsurface, result from the reciprocal attraction of all their particles.\r\nAnother proof may be added. The nutation of the earth’s axis and the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes (N. 146) are occasioned by the action of the\r\nsun and moon on the protuberant matter at the earth’s equator. And,\r\nalthough these inequalities do not give the absolute value of the\r\nterrestrial compression, they show that the fraction expressing it is\r\ncomprised between the limits 1/279 and 1/573.\r\n\r\nIt might be expected that the same compression should result from each,\r\nif the different methods of observation could be made without error.\r\nThis, however, is not the case; for after allowance has been made for\r\nevery cause of error, such discrepancies are found, both in the degrees\r\nof the meridian and in the length of the pendulum, as show that the\r\nfigure of the earth is very complicated. But they are so small, when\r\ncompared with the general results, that they may be disregarded. The\r\ncompression deduced from the mean of the whole appears not to differ\r\nmuch from 1/300; that given by the lunar theory has the advantage of\r\nbeing independent of the irregularities of the earth’s surface and of\r\nlocal attractions. The regularity with which the observed variation in\r\nthe length of the pendulum follows the law of the square of the sine of\r\nthe latitude proves the strata to be elliptical, and symmetrically\r\ndisposed round the centre of gravity of the earth, which affords a\r\nstrong presumption in favour of its original fluidity. It is remarkable\r\nhow little influence the sea has on the variation of the lengths of the\r\narcs of the meridian, or on gravitation; neither does it much affect the\r\nlunar inequalities, from its density being only about a fifth of the\r\nmean density of the earth. For, if the earth were to become fluid, after\r\nbeing stripped of the ocean, it would assume the form of an ellipsoid of\r\nrevolution whose compression is 1/304·8, which differs very little from\r\nthat determined by observation, and proves, not only that the density of\r\nthe ocean is inconsiderable, but that its mean depth is very small.\r\nThere are profound cavities in the bottom of the sea, but its mean depth\r\nprobably does not much exceed the mean height of the continents and\r\nislands above its level. On this account, immense tracts of land may be\r\ndeserted or overwhelmed by the ocean, as appears really to have been the\r\ncase, without any great change in the form of the terrestrial spheroid.\r\nThe variation in the length of the pendulum was first remarked by\r\nRichter in 1672, while observing transits of the fixed stars across the\r\nmeridian at Cayenne, about five degrees north of the equator. He found\r\nthat his clock lost at the rate of 2^m 28^s daily, which induced him\r\nto determine the length of a pendulum beating seconds in that latitude;\r\nand, repeating the experiments on his return to Europe, he found the\r\nseconds’ pendulum at Paris to be more than the twelfth of an inch longer\r\nthan that at Cayenne. The form and size of the earth being determined, a\r\nstandard of measure is furnished with which the dimensions of the solar\r\nsystem may be compared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION VII.\r\n\r\nParallax—Lunar Parallax found from Direct Observation—Solar Parallax\r\n  deduced from the Transit of Venus—Distance of the Sun from the\r\n  Earth—Annual Parallax—Distance of the Fixed Stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE parallax of a celestial body is the angle under which the radius of\r\nthe earth would be seen if viewed from the centre of that body; it\r\naffords the means of ascertaining the distances of the sun, moon, and\r\nplanets (N. 130). When the moon is in the horizon at the instant of\r\nrising or setting, suppose lines to be drawn from her centre to the\r\nspectator and to the centre of the earth: these would form a\r\nright-angled triangle with the terrestrial radius, which is of a known\r\nlength; and, as the parallax or angle at the moon can be measured, all\r\nthe angles and one side are given; whence the distance of the moon from\r\nthe centre of the earth may be computed. The parallax of an object may\r\nbe found, if two observers under the same meridian, but at a very great\r\ndistance from one another, observe its zenith distances on the same day\r\nat the time of its passage over the meridian. By such contemporaneous\r\nobservations at the Cape of Good Hope and at Berlin, the mean horizontal\r\nparallax of the moon was found to be 3459ʺ, whence the mean distance of\r\nthe moon is about sixty times the greatest terrestrial radius, or\r\n237,608 miles nearly.[4] Since the parallax is equal to the radius of\r\nthe earth divided by the distance of the moon, it varies with the\r\ndistance of the moon from the earth under the same parallel of latitude,\r\nand proves the ellipticity of the lunar orbit. When the moon is at her\r\nmean distance, it varies with the terrestrial radii, thus showing that\r\nthe earth is not a sphere (N. 131).\r\n\r\nAlthough the method described is sufficiently accurate for finding the\r\nparallax of an object as near as the moon, it will not answer for the\r\nsun, which is so remote that the smallest error in observation would\r\nlead to a false result. But that difficulty is obviated by the transits\r\nof Venus. When that planet is in her nodes (N. 132), or within 1-1/4° of\r\nthem, that is, in, or nearly in, the plane of the ecliptic, she is\r\noccasionally seen to pass over the sun like a black spot. If we could\r\nimagine that the sun and Venus had no parallax, the line described by\r\nthe planet on his disc, and the duration of the transit, would be the\r\nsame to all the inhabitants of the earth. But, as the semi-diameter of\r\nthe earth has a sensible magnitude when viewed from the centre of the\r\nsun, the line described by the planet in its passage over his disc\r\nappears to be nearer to his centre, or farther from it, according to the\r\nposition of the observer; so that the duration of the transit varies\r\nwith the different points of the earth’s surface at which it is observed\r\n(N. 133). This difference of time, being entirely the effect of\r\nparallax, furnishes the means of computing it from the known motions of\r\nthe earth and Venus, by the same method as for the eclipses of the sun.\r\nIn fact, the ratio of the distances of Venus and the sun from the earth\r\nat the time of the transit is known from the theory of their elliptical\r\nmotion. Consequently the ratio of the parallaxes of these two bodies,\r\nbeing inversely as their distances, is given; and as the transit gives\r\nthe difference of the parallaxes, that of the sun is obtained. In 1769\r\nthe parallax of the sun was determined by observations of a transit of\r\nVenus made at Wardhus in Lapland, and at Tahiti in the South Sea. The\r\nlatter observation was the object of Cook’s first voyage. The transit\r\nlasted about six hours at Tahiti, and the difference in duration at\r\nthese two stations was eight minutes; whence the sun’s horizontal\r\nparallax was found to be 8ʺ·72. But by other considerations it has been\r\nreduced by Professor Encke to 8ʺ·5776; from which the mean distance of\r\nthe sun appears to be about ninety-five millions of miles. This is\r\nconfirmed by an inequality in the motion of the moon, which depends upon\r\nthe parallax of the sun, and which, when compared with observation,\r\ngives 8ʺ·6 for the sun’s parallax. The transits of Venus in 1874 and\r\n1882 will be unfavourable for ascertaining the accuracy of the solar\r\nparallax, and no other transit of that planet will take place till the\r\ntwenty-first century; but in the mean time recourse may be had to the\r\noppositions of Mars.\r\n\r\nThe parallax of Venus is determined by her transits; that of Mars by\r\ndirect observation, and it is found to be nearly double that of the sun,\r\nwhen the planet is in opposition. The distance of these two planets from\r\nthe earth is therefore known in terrestrial radii, consequently their\r\nmean distances from the sun may be computed; and as the ratios of the\r\ndistances of the planets from the sun are known by Kepler’s law, of the\r\nsquares of the periodic times of any two planets being as the cubes of\r\ntheir mean distances from the sun, their absolute distances in miles are\r\neasily found (N. 134). This law is very remarkable, in thus uniting all\r\nthe bodies of the system, and extending to the satellites as well as the\r\nplanets.\r\n\r\nFar as the earth seems to be from the sun, Uranus is no less than\r\nnineteen, and Neptune thirty times farther. Situate on the verge of the\r\nsystem, the sun must appear from Uranus not much larger than Venus does\r\nto us, and from Neptune as a star of the fifth magnitude. The earth\r\ncannot even be visible as a telescopic object to a body so remote as\r\neither Uranus or Neptune. Yet man, the inhabitant of the earth, soars\r\nbeyond the vast dimensions of the system to which his planet belongs,\r\nand assumes the diameter of its orbit as the base of a triangle whose\r\napex extends to the stars.\r\n\r\nSublime as the idea is, this assumption proves ineffectual, except in a\r\nvery few cases; for the apparent places of the fixed stars are not\r\nsensibly changed by the earth’s annual revolution. With the aid derived\r\nfrom the refinements of modern astronomy, and of the most perfect\r\ninstruments, a sensible parallax has been detected only in a very few of\r\nthese remote suns. α Centauri has a parallax of one second of space,\r\ntherefore it is the nearest known star, and yet it is more than two\r\nhundred thousand times farther from us than the sun is. At such a\r\ndistance not only the terrestrial orbit shrinks to a point, but the\r\nwhole solar system, seen in the focus of the most powerful telescope,\r\nmight be eclipsed by the thickness of a spider’s thread. Light, flying\r\nat the rate of 190,000 miles in a second, would take more than three\r\nyears to travel over that space. One of the nearest stars may therefore\r\nhave been kindled or extinguished more than three years before we could\r\nhave been aware of so mighty an event. But this distance must be small\r\nwhen compared with that of the most remote of the bodies which are\r\nvisible in the heavens. The fixed stars are undoubtedly luminous like\r\nthe sun: it is therefore probable that they are not nearer to one\r\nanother than the sun is to the nearest of them. In the milky way and the\r\nother starry nebulæ, some of the stars that seem to us to be close to\r\nothers may be far behind them in the boundless depth of space; nay, may\r\nbe rationally supposed to be situate many thousand times farther off.\r\nLight would therefore require thousands of years to come to the earth\r\nfrom those myriads of suns of which our own is but “the remote\r\ncompanion.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION VIII.\r\n\r\nMasses of Planets that have no Satellites determined from their\r\n  Perturbations—Masses of the others obtained from the Motions of their\r\n  Satellites—Masses of the Sun, the Earth, of Jupiter and of the Jovial\r\n  System—Mass of the Moon—Real Diameters of Planets, how obtained—Size\r\n  of Sun, Densities of the Heavenly Bodies—Formation of Astronomical\r\n  Tables—Requisite Data and Means of obtaining them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE masses of such planets as have no satellites are known by comparing\r\nthe inequalities they produce in the motions of the earth and of each\r\nother, determined theoretically, with the same inequalities given by\r\nobservation; for the disturbing cause must necessarily be proportional\r\nto the effect it produces. The masses of the satellites themselves may\r\nalso be compared with that of the sun by their perturbations. Thus, it\r\nis found, from the comparison of a vast number of observations with La\r\nPlace’s theory of Jupiter’s satellites, that the mass of the sun is no\r\nless than 65,000,000 times greater than the least of these moons. But,\r\nas the quantities of matter in any two primary planets are directly as\r\nthe cubes of the mean distances at which their satellites revolve, and\r\ninversely as the squares of their periodic times (N. 135), the mass of\r\nthe sun and of any planets which have satellites may be compared with\r\nthe mass of the earth. In this manner it is computed that the mass of\r\nthe sun is 354,936 times that of the earth; whence the great\r\nperturbations of the moon, and the rapid motion of the perigee and nodes\r\nof her orbit (N. 136). Even Jupiter, the largest of the planets, has\r\nbeen found by Professor Airy to be 1047·871 times less than the sun;\r\nand, indeed, the mass of the whole Jovial system is not more than the\r\n1054·4th part of that of the sun. So that the mass of the satellites\r\nbears a very small proportion to that of their primary. The mass of the\r\nmoon is determined from several sources—from her action on the\r\nterrestrial equator, which occasions the nutation in the axis of\r\nrotation; from her horizontal parallax; from an inequality she produces\r\nin the sun’s longitude; and from her action on the tides. The three\r\nfirst quantities, computed from theory and compared with their observed\r\nvalues, give her mass respectively equal to the 1/71, 1/74·2, and\r\n1/69·2, part of that of the earth, which do not differ much from each\r\nother. Dr. Brinkley has found it to be 1/80 from the constant of lunar\r\nnutation: but, from the moon’s action in raising the tides, her mass\r\nappears to be about the 1/75 part of that of the earth—a value that\r\ncannot differ much from the truth.\r\n\r\nThe apparent diameters of the sun, moon, and planets are determined by\r\nmeasurement; therefore their real diameters may be compared with that of\r\nthe earth; for the real diameter of a planet is to the real diameter of\r\nthe earth, or 7926 miles, as the apparent diameter of the planet to the\r\napparent diameter of the earth as seen from the planet, that is, to\r\ntwice the parallax of the planet. According to Bessel, the mean apparent\r\ndiameter of the sun is 1923ʺ·64, and with the solar parallax 8ʺ·5776, it\r\nwill be found that the diameter of the sun is about 886,877 miles.\r\nTherefore, if the centre of the sun were to coincide with the centre of\r\nthe earth, his volume would not only include the orbit of the moon, but\r\nwould extend nearly as far again; for the moon’s mean distance from the\r\nearth is about sixty times the earth’s equatorial radius, or 238,793\r\nmiles: so that twice the distance of the moon is 477,586 miles, which\r\ndiffers but little from the solar radius; his equatorial radius is\r\nprobably not much less than the major axis of the lunar orbit. The\r\ndiameter of the moon is only 2160 miles; and Jupiter’s diameter of\r\n88,200 miles is very much less than that of the sun; the diameter of\r\nPallas does not much exceed 79 miles, so that an inhabitant of that\r\nplanet, in one of our steam carriages, might go round his world in a few\r\nhours. The diameters of Lutetia and Atalanta are only 8 and 4 miles\r\nrespectively; but the whole of the 55 telescopic planets are so small,\r\nthat their united mass is probably not more than the fifth or sixth part\r\nof that of the moon.\r\n\r\nThe densities of bodies are proportional to their masses, divided by\r\ntheir volumes. Hence, if the sun and planets be assumed to be spheres,\r\ntheir volumes will be as the cubes of their diameters. Now, the apparent\r\ndiameters of the sun and earth, at their mean distance, are 1923ʺ·6 and\r\n17ʺ·1552, and the mass of the earth is the 354,936th part of that of the\r\nsun taken as the unit. It follows, therefore, that the earth is four\r\ntimes as dense as the sun. But the sun is so large that his attractive\r\nforce would cause bodies to fall through about 334·65 feet in a second.\r\nConsequently, if he were habitable by human beings, they would be unable\r\nto move, since their weight would be thirty times as great as it is\r\nhere. A man of moderate size would weigh about two tons at the surface\r\nof the sun; whereas at the surface of some of the new planets he would\r\nbe so light that it would be impossible to stand steady, since he would\r\nonly weigh a few pounds. The mean density of the earth has been\r\ndetermined by the following method. Since a comparison of the action of\r\ntwo planets upon a third gives the ratio of the masses of these two\r\nplanets, it is clear that, if we can compare the effect of the whole\r\nearth with the effect of any part of it, a comparison may be instituted\r\nbetween the mass of the whole earth and the mass of that part of it. Now\r\na leaden ball was weighed against the earth by comparing the effects of\r\neach upon a pendulum; the nearness of the smaller mass making it produce\r\na sensible effect as compared with that of the larger: for by the laws\r\nof attraction the whole earth must be considered as collected in its\r\ncentre. By this method it has been found that the mean density of the\r\nearth is 5·660 times greater than that of water at the temperature of\r\n62° of Fahrenheit’s thermometer. The late Mr. Baily, whose accuracy as\r\nan experimental philosopher is acknowledged, was unremittingly occupied\r\nnearly four years in accomplishing this very important object. In order\r\nto ascertain the mean density of the earth still more perfectly, Mr.\r\nAiry made a series of experiments to compare the simultaneous\r\noscillations of two pendulums, one at the bottom of the Harton coal-pit,\r\n1260 feet deep, in Northumberland, and the other on the surface of the\r\nearth immediately above it. The oscillations of the pendulums were\r\ncompared with an astronomical clock at each station, and the time was\r\ninstantaneously transmitted from one to the other by a telegraphic wire.\r\nThe oscillations were observed for more than 100 hours continuously,\r\nwhen it was found that the lower pendulum made 2-1/2 oscillations more\r\nin 24 hours than the upper one. The experiment was repeated for the same\r\nlength of time with the same result; but on this occasion the upper\r\npendulum was taken to the bottom of the mine and the lower brought to\r\nthe surface. From the difference between the oscillations at the two\r\nstations it appears that gravitation at the bottom of the mine exceeds\r\nthat at the surface by the 1/19190 part, and that the mean density of\r\nthe earth is 6·565, which is greater than that obtained by Mr. Baily by\r\n·89. While employed on the trigonometrical survey of Scotland, Colonel\r\nJames determined the mean density of the earth to be 5·316, from a\r\ndeviation of the plumb-line amounting to 2ʺ, caused by the attraction of\r\nArthur’s Seat and the heights east of Edinburgh: it agrees more nearly\r\nwith the density found by Mr. Baily than with that deduced from Mr.\r\nAiry’s experiments. All the planets and satellites appear to be of less\r\ndensity than the earth. The motions of Jupiter’s satellites show that\r\nhis density increases towards his centre. Were his mass homogeneous, his\r\nequatorial and polar axes would be in the ratio of 41 to 36, whereas\r\nthey are observed to be only as 41 to 38. The singular irregularities in\r\nthe form of Saturn, and the great compression of Mars, prove the\r\ninternal structure of these two planets to be very far from uniform.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on the theory of rotation, it may not be foreign to the\r\nsubject to give some idea of the methods of computing the places of the\r\nplanets, and of forming astronomical tables. Astronomy is now divided\r\ninto the three distinct departments of theory, observation, and\r\ncomputation. Since the problem of the three bodies can only be solved by\r\napproximation, the analytical astronomer determines the position of a\r\nplanet in space by a series of corrections. Its place in its circular\r\norbit is first found, then the addition or subtraction of the equation\r\nof the centre (N. 48) to or from its mean place gives its position in\r\nthe ellipse. This again is corrected by the application of the principal\r\nperiodic inequalities. But, as these are determined for some particular\r\nposition of the three bodies, they require to be corrected to suit other\r\nrelative positions. This process is continued till the corrections\r\nbecome less than the errors of observation, when it is obviously\r\nunnecessary to carry the approximation further. The true latitude and\r\ndistance of the planet from the sun are obtained by methods similar to\r\nthose employed for the longitude.\r\n\r\nAs the earth revolves equably about its axis in 24 hours, at the rate of\r\n15° in an hour, time becomes a measure of angular motion, and the\r\nprincipal element in astronomy, where the object is to determine the\r\nexact state of the heavens and the successive changes it undergoes in\r\nall ages, past, present, and to come. Now, the longitude, latitude, and\r\ndistance of a planet from the sun are given in terms of the time, by\r\ngeneral analytical formulæ. These formulæ will consequently give the\r\nexact place of the body in the heavens, for any time assumed at\r\npleasure, provided they can be reduced to numbers. But before the\r\ncalculator begins his task the observer must furnish the necessary data,\r\nwhich are, obviously, the forms of the orbits, and their positions with\r\nregard to the plane of the ecliptic (N. 57). It is therefore necessary\r\nto determine by observation, for each planet, the length of the major\r\naxis of its orbit, the excentricity, the inclination of the orbit to the\r\nplane of the ecliptic, the longitudes of its perihelion and ascending\r\nnode at a given time, the periodic time of the planet, and its longitude\r\nat any instant arbitrarily assumed, as an origin from whence all its\r\nsubsequent and antecedent longitudes are estimated. Each of these\r\nquantities is determined from that position of the planet on which it\r\nhas most influence. For example, the sum of the greatest and least\r\ndistances of the planet from the sun is equal to the major axis of the\r\norbit, and their difference is equal to twice the excentricity. The\r\nlongitude of the planet, when at its least distance from the sun, is the\r\nsame with the longitude of the perihelion; the greatest latitude of the\r\nplanet is equal to the inclination of the orbit: the longitude of the\r\nplanet, when in the plane of the ecliptic in passing towards the north,\r\nis the longitude of the ascending node, and the periodic time is the\r\ninterval between two consecutive passages of the planet through the same\r\nnode, a small correction being made for the precession of the node\r\nduring the revolution of the planet (N. 137). Notwithstanding the\r\nexcellence of instruments and the accuracy of modern observers,\r\nunavoidable errors of observation can only be compensated by finding the\r\nvalue of each element from the mean of a thousand, or even many\r\nthousands of observations. For as it is probable that the errors are not\r\nall in one direction, but that some are in excess and others in defect,\r\nthey will compensate each other when combined.\r\n\r\nHowever, the values of the elements determined separately can only be\r\nregarded as approximate, because they are so connected that the\r\nestimation of any one independently will induce errors in the others.\r\nThe excentricity depends upon the longitude of the perihelion, the mean\r\nmotion depends upon the major axis, the longitude of the node upon the\r\ninclination of the orbit, and _vice versâ_. Consequently, the place of a\r\nplanet computed with the approximate data will differ from its observed\r\nplace. Then the difficulty is to ascertain what elements are most in\r\nfault, since the difference in question is the error of all; that is\r\nobviated by finding the errors of some thousands of observations, and\r\ncombining them, so as to correct the elements simultaneously, and to\r\nmake the sum of the squares of the errors a minimum with regard to each\r\nelement (N. 138). The method of accomplishing this depends upon the\r\nTheory of Probabilities; a subject fertile in most important results in\r\nthe various departments of science and of civil life, and quite\r\nindispensable in the determination of astronomical data. A series of\r\nobservations continued for some years will give approximate values of\r\nthe secular and periodic inequalities, which must be corrected from time\r\nto time, till theory and observation agree. And these again will give\r\nvalues of the masses of the bodies forming the solar system, which are\r\nimportant data in computing their motions. The periodic inequalities\r\nderived from a great number of observations are employed for the\r\ndetermination of the values of the masses till such time as the secular\r\ninequalities shall be perfectly known, which will then give them with\r\nall the necessary precision. When all these quantities are determined in\r\nnumbers, the longitude, latitude, and distance of the planet from the\r\nsun are computed for stated intervals, and formed into tables, arranged\r\naccording to the time estimated from a given epoch, so that the place of\r\nthe body may be determined from them by inspection alone, at any instant\r\nfor perhaps a thousand years before and after that epoch. By this\r\ntedious process, tables have been computed for all the great planets,\r\nand several of the small, besides the moon and the satellites of\r\nJupiter. In the present state of astronomy the masses and elements of\r\nthe orbits are pretty well known, so that the tables only require to be\r\ncorrected from time to time as observations become more accurate. Those\r\ncontaining the motions of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus have already been\r\ntwice constructed within the last thirty years, and the tables of\r\nJupiter and Saturn agree almost perfectly with modern observation. The\r\nfollowing prediction will be found in the sixth edition of this book,\r\npublished in the year 1842: “Those of Uranus, however, are already\r\ndefective, probably because the discovery of that planet in 1781 is too\r\nrecent to admit of much precision in the determination of its motions,\r\nor that possibly it may be subject to disturbances from some unseen\r\nplanet revolving about the sun beyond the present boundaries of our\r\nsystem. If, after a lapse of years, the tables formed from a combination\r\nof numerous observations should be still inadequate to represent the\r\nmotions of Uranus, the discrepancies may reveal the existence, nay, even\r\nthe mass and orbit, of a body placed for ever beyond the sphere of\r\nvision.”[5]\r\n\r\nThat prediction has been fulfilled since the seventh edition of this\r\nbook was published. Not only the existence of Neptune, revolving at the\r\ndistance of three thousand millions of miles from the sun, has been\r\ndiscovered from his disturbing action on Uranus, but his mass, the form\r\nand position of his orbit in space, and his periodic time had been\r\ndetermined before the planet had been seen, and the planet itself was\r\ndiscovered in the very point of the heavens which had been assigned to\r\nit. It had been noticed for years that the perturbation of Uranus had\r\nincreased in an unaccountable manner (N. 139). After the disturbing\r\naction of all the known planets had been determined, it was found that,\r\nbetween the years 1833 and 1837, the observed and computed distance of\r\nUranus from the sun differed by 240,000 miles, which is about the mean\r\ndistance of the moon from the earth, while, in 1841, the error in the\r\ngeocentric longitude of the planet amounted to 96ʺ. These discrepancies\r\nwere therefore attributed to the attraction of some unseen and unknown\r\nplanet, consequently they gave rise to a case altogether unprecedented\r\nin the history of astronomy. Heretofore it was required to determine the\r\ndisturbing action of one known planet upon another. Whereas the inverse\r\nproblem had now to be solved, in which it was required to find the place\r\nof an unknown body in the heavens, at a given time, together with its\r\nmass, and the form and position of its orbit, from the disturbance it\r\nproduced on the motions of another. The difficulty was extreme, because\r\nall the elements of the orbit of Uranus were erroneous from the action\r\nof Neptune, and those of Neptune’s orbit were unknown. In this dilemma\r\nit was necessary to form some hypothesis with regard to the unknown\r\nplanet; it was therefore assumed, according to Bode’s empirical law on\r\nthe mean distances of the planets, that it was revolving at twice the\r\ndistance of Uranus from the sun. In fact, the periodic time of Uranus is\r\nabout 84 years, and, as the discrepancies in his motions increased\r\nslowly and regularly, it was evident that it would require a planet with\r\na much longer periodic time to produce them—moreover, it was clear that\r\nthe new planet must be exterior to Uranus, otherwise it would have\r\ndisturbed the motions of Saturn.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance tended to lessen the difficulty; the latitude of\r\nUranus was not much affected, therefore it was concluded that the\r\ninclination of the orbit of the unknown body must be very small, and, as\r\nthat of the orbit of Uranus is only 46ʹ 28ʺ·4, both planets were assumed\r\nto be moving in the plane of the ecliptic, and thus the elements of the\r\norbit of the unknown planet were reduced from six to four. Having thus\r\nassumed that the unknown body was revolving in a circle in the plane of\r\nthe ecliptic, the analytical expression of its action on the motion of\r\nUranus, when in numerous points of its orbit, was compared with the\r\nobserved longitude of Uranus, through a regular series of years, by\r\nmeans of which the faulty elements of the orbit of Uranus were\r\neliminated, or got rid of, and there only remained a relation between\r\nthe mass of the new planet and three of the elements of its orbit; and\r\nit then was necessary to assume such a value for two of them as would\r\nsuit the rest. That was accomplished so dexterously, that the\r\nperturbations of Uranus were perfectly conformable to the motions of\r\nNeptune, moving in the orbit thus found, and the place of the new planet\r\nexactly agreed with observation. Subsequently its orbit and motions have\r\nbeen determined more accurately.\r\n\r\nThe honour of this admirable effort of genius is shared by Mr. Adams and\r\nM. Le Verrier, who, independently of each other, arrived at these\r\nwonderful results. Mr. Adams had determined the mass and apparent\r\ndiameter of Neptune, with all the circumstances of its motion, eight\r\nmonths before M. Le Verrier had terminated his results, and had also\r\npointed out the exact spot where the planet would be found; but the\r\nEnglish observers neglected to look for it till M. Le Verrier made known\r\nhis researches, and communicated its position to Dr. Galle, at Berlin,\r\nwho found it the very first night he looked for it, and then it was\r\nevident that it would have been seen in the place Mr. Adams had assigned\r\nto it eight months before had it been looked for. So closely did the\r\nresults of these two great mathematicians agree.\r\n\r\nNeptune has a diameter of 39,793 miles, consequently he is nearly 200\r\ntimes larger than the earth, and may be seen with a telescope of\r\nmoderate power. His motion is retrograde at present, and six times\r\nslower than that of the earth. At so great a distance from the sun it\r\ncan only have the 1/1300th part of the light and heat the earth\r\nreceives; but having a satellite, the deficiency of light may in some\r\nmeasure be supplied.\r\n\r\nThe prediction may now be transferred from Uranus to Neptune, whose\r\nperturbations may reveal the existence of a planet still further\r\nremoved, which may for ever remain beyond the reach of telescopic\r\nvision—yet its mass, the form and position of its orbit, and all the\r\ncircumstances of its motion may become known, and the limits of the\r\nsolar system may still be extended hundreds of millions of miles.\r\n\r\nThe mean distance of Neptune from the sun has subsequently proved to be\r\nonly 2893 millions of miles, and the period of his revolution 166 years,\r\nso that Baron Bode’s law, of the interval between the orbits of any two\r\nplanets being twice as great as the inferior interval and half of the\r\nsuperior, fails in the case of Neptune, though it was useful on the\r\nfirst approximation to his motions; and since Bode’s time it has led to\r\nthe discovery of fifty-five telescopic planets revolving between the\r\norbits of Mars and Jupiter, some by chance, others by a systematic\r\nsearch on the faith that these minute planets are fragments of a larger\r\nbody that has exploded, because their distances from the sun are nearly\r\nthe same; the lines of the nodes of some of their orbits terminate in\r\nthe same points of the heavens, and the inclinations of their orbits are\r\nsuch as might have taken place from their mutual disturbances at the\r\ntime of the explosion, and while yet they were near enough for their\r\nforms to affect their motions. The orbits of the more recently\r\ndiscovered asteroids show that this hypothesis is untenable.\r\n\r\nThe tables of Mars, Venus, and even those of the sun, have been greatly\r\nimproved, and still engage the attention of our Astronomer Royal, Mr.\r\nAiry, and other eminent astronomers. We are chiefly indebted to the\r\nGerman astronomers for tables of the four older telescopic planets,\r\nVesta, Juno, Ceres, and Pallas; the others have only been discovered\r\nsince the year 1845.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the path of a planet when disturbed by all the\r\nothers, a problem which has employed the talents of the greatest\r\nastronomers, from Newton to the present day, is only successfully\r\naccomplished with regard to the older planets, which revolve in nearly\r\ncircular orbits, but little inclined to the plane of the ecliptic. When\r\nthe excentricity and inclination of the orbits are great, their analysis\r\nfails, because the series expressing the co-ordinates of the bodies\r\nbecome extremely complicated, and do not converge when applied to comets\r\nand the telescopic planets. This difficulty has been overcome by Sir\r\nJohn Lubbock, and other mathematicians, who have the honour of having\r\ncompleted the theory of planetary motion, which becomes every day of\r\nmore importance, from the new planets that have been discovered, and\r\nalso with regard to comets, many of which return to the sun at regular\r\nintervals, and from whose perturbations the masses of the planets will\r\nbe more accurately determined, and the retarding influence of the\r\nethereal medium better known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION IX.\r\n\r\nRotation of the Sun and Planets—Saturn’s Rings—Periods of the Rotation\r\n  of the Moon and other Satellites equal to the Periods of their\r\n  Revolutions—Form of Lunar Spheroid—Libration, Aspect, and Constitution\r\n  of the Moon—Rotation of Jupiter’s Satellites.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE oblate form of several of the planets indicates rotatory motion.\r\nThis has been confirmed in most cases by tracing spots on their surface,\r\nby which their poles and times of rotation have been determined. The\r\nrotation of Mercury is unknown, on account of his proximity to the sun;\r\nthat of the new planets has not yet been ascertained. The sun revolves\r\nin twenty-five days and ten hours about an axis which is directed\r\ntowards a point half-way between the pole-star and α of Lyra, the plane\r\nof rotation being inclined by 7° 30ʹ, or a little more than seven\r\ndegrees, to the plane of the ecliptic: it may therefore be concluded\r\nthat the sun’s mass is a spheroid, flattened at the poles. From the\r\nrotation of the sun, there was every reason to believe that he has a\r\nprogressive motion in space, a circumstance which is confirmed by\r\nobservation. But, in consequence of the reaction of the planets, he\r\ndescribes a small irregular orbit about the centre of gravity of the\r\nsystem, never deviating from his position by more than twice his own\r\ndiameter, or a little more than seven times the distance of the moon\r\nfrom the earth. The sun and all his attendants rotate from west to east,\r\non axes that remain nearly parallel to themselves (N. 140) in every\r\npoint of their orbit, and with angular velocities that are sensibly\r\nuniform (N. 141). Although the uniformity in the direction of their\r\nrotation is a circumstance hitherto unaccounted for in the economy of\r\nnature, yet, from the design and adaptation of every other part to the\r\nperfection of the whole, a coincidence so remarkable cannot be\r\naccidental. And, as the revolutions of the planets and satellites are\r\nalso from west to east, it is evident that both must have arisen from\r\nthe primitive cause which determined the planetary motions.[6] Indeed,\r\nLa Place has computed the probability to be as four millions to one that\r\nall the motions of the planets, both of rotation and revolution, were at\r\nonce imparted by an original common cause, but of which we know neither\r\nthe nature nor the epoch.\r\n\r\nThe larger planets rotate in shorter periods than the smaller planets\r\nand the earth. Their compression is consequently greater, and the action\r\nof the sun and of their satellites occasions a nutation in their axes\r\nand a precession of their equinoxes (N. 147) similar to that which\r\nobtains in the terrestrial spheroid, from the attraction of the sun and\r\nmoon on the prominent matter at the equator. Jupiter revolves in less\r\nthan ten hours round an axis at right angles to certain dark belts or\r\nbands, which always cross his equator. (See Plate 1.) This rapid\r\nrotation occasions a very great compression in his form. His equatorial\r\naxis exceeds his polar axis by 6000 miles, whereas the difference in the\r\naxes of the earth is only about twenty-six and a half. It is an evident\r\nconsequence of Kepler’s law of the squares of the periodic times of the\r\nplanets being as the cubes of the major axes of their orbits, that the\r\nheavenly bodies move slower the farther they are from the sun. In\r\ncomparing the periods of the revolutions of Jupiter and Saturn with the\r\ntimes of their rotation, it appears that a year of Jupiter contains\r\nnearly ten thousand of his days, and that of Saturn about thirty\r\nthousand Saturnian days.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Saturn is unparalleled in the system of the world. He\r\nis a spheroid nearly 1000 times larger than the earth, surrounded by a\r\nring even brighter than himself, which always remains suspended in the\r\nplane of his equator: and, viewed with a very good telescope, it is\r\nfound to consist of two concentric rings, divided by a dark band. The\r\nexterior ring, as seen through Mr. Lassell’s great equatorial at Malta,\r\nhas a dark-striped band through the centre, and is altogether less\r\nbright than the interior ring, one half of which is extremely brilliant;\r\nwhile the interior half is shaded in rings like the seats in an\r\namphitheatre. Mr. Lassell made the remarkable discovery of a dark\r\ntransparent ring, whose edge coincides with the inner edge of the\r\ninterior ring, and which occupies about half the space between it and\r\nSaturn. He compares it to a band of dark-coloured crape drawn across a\r\nportion of the disc of the planet, and the part projected upon the blue\r\nsky is also transparent. At the time these observations were made at\r\nMalta, Captain Jacob discovered the transparent ring at Madras. It is\r\nconjectured to be fluid; even the luminous rings cannot be very dense,\r\nsince the density of Saturn himself is known to be less than the eighth\r\npart of that of the earth. A transit of the ring across a star might\r\nreveal something concerning this wonderful object. The ball of Saturn is\r\nstriped by belts of different colours. At the time of these observations\r\nthe part above the ring was bright white; at his equator there was a\r\nruddy belt divided in two, above which were belts of a bluish green\r\nalternately dark and light, while at the pole there was a circular space\r\nof a pale colour. (See Plate 2.) The mean distance of the interior part\r\nof the double ring from the surface of the planet is about 22,240 miles,\r\nit is no less than 33,360 miles broad, but, by the estimation of Sir\r\nJohn Herschel, its thickness does not much exceed 100 miles, so that it\r\nappears like a plane. By the laws of mechanics, it is impossible that\r\nthis body can retain its position by the adhesion of its particles\r\nalone. It must necessarily revolve with a velocity that will generate a\r\ncentrifugal force sufficient to balance the attraction of Saturn.\r\nObservation confirms the truth of these principles, showing that the\r\nrings rotate from west to east about the planet in ten hours and a half,\r\nwhich is nearly the time a satellite would take to revolve about Saturn\r\nat the same distance. Their plane is inclined to the ecliptic, at an\r\nangle of 28° 10ʹ 44ʺ·5; in consequence of this obliquity of position,\r\nthey always appear elliptical to us, but with an excentricity so\r\nvariable as even to be occasionally like a straight line drawn across\r\nthe planet. In the beginning of October, 1832, the plane of the rings\r\npassed through the centre of the earth; in that position they are only\r\nvisible with very superior instruments, and appear like a fine line\r\nacross the disc of Saturn. About the middle of December, in the same\r\nyear, the rings became invisible, with ordinary instruments, on account\r\nof their plane passing through the sun. In the end of April, 1833, the\r\nrings vanished a second time, and reappeared in June of that year.\r\nSimilar phenomena will occur as often as Saturn has the same longitude\r\nwith either node of his rings. Each side of these rings has alternately\r\nfifteen years of sunshine and fifteen years of darkness.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular result of theory, that the rings could not maintain\r\ntheir stability of rotation if they were everywhere of uniform\r\nthickness; for the smallest disturbance would destroy the equilibrium,\r\nwhich would become more and more deranged, till, at last, they would be\r\nprecipitated on the surface of the planet. The rings of Saturn must\r\ntherefore be irregular solids, of unequal breadth in different parts of\r\nthe circumference, so that their centres of gravity do not coincide with\r\nthe centres of their figures. Professor Struve has also discovered that\r\nthe centre of the rings is not concentric with the centre of Saturn. The\r\ninterval between the outer edge of the globe of the planet and the outer\r\nedge of the rings on one side is 11ʺ·272, and, on the other side, the\r\ninterval is 11ʺ·390, consequently there is an excentricity of the globe\r\nin the rings of 0ʺ·215. If the rings obeyed different forces, they would\r\nnot remain in the same plane, but the powerful attraction of Saturn\r\nalways maintains them and his satellites in the plane of his equator.\r\nThe rings, by their mutual action, and that of the sun and satellites,\r\nmust oscillate about the centre of Saturn, and produce phenomena of\r\nlight and shadow whose periods extend to many years. According to M.\r\nBessel the mass of Saturn’s ring is equal to the 1/118 part of that of\r\nthe planet.\r\n\r\nThe periods of rotation of the moon and the other satellites are equal\r\nto the times of their revolutions, consequently these bodies always turn\r\nthe same face to their primaries. However, as the mean motion of the\r\nmoon is subject to a secular inequality, which will ultimately amount to\r\nmany circumferences (N. 108), if the rotation of the moon were perfectly\r\nuniform and not affected by the same inequalities, it would cease\r\nexactly to counterbalance the motion of revolution; and the moon, in the\r\ncourse of ages, would successively and gradually discover every point of\r\nher surface to the earth. But theory proves that this never can happen;\r\nfor the rotation of the moon, though it does not partake of the periodic\r\ninequalities of her revolution, is affected by the same secular\r\nvariations, so that her motions of rotation and revolution round the\r\nearth will always balance each other, and remain equal. This\r\ncircumstance arises from the form of the lunar spheroid, which has three\r\nprincipal axes of different lengths at right angles to each other.\r\n\r\nThe moon is flattened at her poles from her centrifugal force, therefore\r\nher polar axis is the least. The other two are in the plane of her\r\nequator, but that directed towards the earth is the greatest (N. 142).\r\nThe attraction of the earth, as if it had drawn out that part of the\r\nmoon’s equator, constantly brings the greatest axis, and consequently\r\nthe same hemisphere, towards us, which makes her rotation participate in\r\nthe secular variations of her mean motion of revolution. Even if the\r\nangular velocities of rotation and revolution had not been nicely\r\nbalanced in the beginning of the moon’s motion, the attraction of the\r\nearth would have recalled the greatest axis to the direction of the line\r\njoining the centres of the moon and earth; so that it would have\r\nvibrated on each side of that line in the same manner as a pendulum\r\noscillates on each side of the vertical from the influence of\r\ngravitation. No such libration is perceptible; and, as the smallest\r\ndisturbance would make it evident, it is clear that, if the moon has\r\never been touched by a comet, the mass of the latter must have been\r\nextremely small. If it had been only the hundred thousandth part of that\r\nof the earth, it would have rendered the libration sensible. According\r\nto analysis, a similar libration exists in the motions of Jupiter’s\r\nsatellites, which still remains insensible to observation, and yet the\r\ncomet of 1770 passed twice through the midst of them.\r\n\r\nThe moon, it is true, is liable to librations depending upon the\r\nposition of the spectator. At her rising, part of the western edge of\r\nher disc is visible, which is invisible at her setting, and the contrary\r\ntakes place with regard to her eastern edge. There are also librations\r\narising from the relative positions of the earth and moon in their\r\nrespective orbits; but, as they are only optical appearances, one\r\nhemisphere will be eternally concealed from the earth. For the same\r\nreason the earth, which must be so splendid an object to one lunar\r\nhemisphere, will be for ever veiled from the other. On account of these\r\ncircumstances, the remoter hemisphere of the moon has its day a\r\nfortnight long, and a night of the same duration, not even enlightened\r\nby a moon, while the favoured side is illuminated by the reflection of\r\nthe earth during its long night. A planet exhibiting a surface thirteen\r\ntimes larger than that of the moon, with all the varieties of clouds,\r\nland, and water, coming successively into view, must be a splendid\r\nobject to a lunar traveller in a journey to his antipodes. The great\r\nheight of the lunar mountains probably has a considerable influence on\r\nthe phenomena of her motion, the more so as her compression is small,\r\nand her mass considerable. In the curve passing through the poles, and\r\nthat diameter of the moon which always points to the earth, nature has\r\nfurnished a permanent meridian, to which the different spots on her\r\nsurface have been referred, and their positions are determined with as\r\nmuch accuracy as those of many of the most remarkable places on the\r\nsurface of our globe. According to the observations of Professor Secchi\r\nat Rome, the mountains of the moon are mostly volcanic and of three\r\nkinds. The first and oldest have their borders obliterated, so that they\r\nlook like deep wells; the second, which are of an intermediate class,\r\nhave elevated, and, for the most part, regular unbroken edges, with the\r\nground around them raised to a prodigious extent in proportion to the\r\nsize of the volcano, with generally an insulated rock in the centre of\r\nthe crater. The third, and most recent class, are very small, and seem\r\nto be the last effort of the expiring volcanic force, which is probably\r\nnow extinct.\r\n\r\nThe distance and minuteness of Jupiter’s satellites render it extremely\r\ndifficult to ascertain their rotation. It was, however, accomplished by\r\nSir William Herschel from their relative brightness. He observed that\r\nthey alternately exceed each other in brilliancy, and, by comparing the\r\nmaxima and minima of their illumination with their positions relatively\r\nto the sun and to their primary, he found that, like the moon, the time\r\nof their rotation is equal to the period of their revolution about\r\nJupiter. Miraldi was led to the same conclusion with regard to the\r\nfourth satellite, from the motion of a spot on its surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SECTION X.\r\n\r\nRotation of the Earth invariable—Decrease in the Earth’s mean\r\n  Temperature—Earth originally in a state of Fusion—Length of Day\r\n  constant—Decrease of Temperature ascribed by Sir John Herschel to the\r\n  variation in the Excentricity of the Terrestrial Orbit—Difference in\r\n  the Temperature of the two Hemispheres erroneously ascribed to the\r\n  Excess in the Length of Spring and Summer in the Southern Hemisphere;\r\n  attributed by Sir Charles Lyell to the Operation of existing\r\n  Causes—Three principal Axes of Rotation—Position of the Axis of\r\n  Rotation on the Surface of the Earth invariable—Ocean not sufficient\r\n  to restore the Equilibrium of the Earth if deranged—Its Density and\r\n  mean Depth—Internal Structure of the Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rotation of the earth, which determines the length of the day, may\r\nbe regarded as one of the most important elements in the system of the\r\nworld. It serves as a measure of time, and forms the standard of\r\ncomparison for the revolutions of the celestial bodies, which, by their\r\nproportional increase or decrease, would soon disclose any changes it\r\nmight sustain. Theory and observation concur in proving that, among the\r\ninnumerable vicissitudes which prevail throughout creation, the period\r\nof the earth’s diurnal rotation is immutable. The water of rivers,\r\nfalling from a higher to a lower level, carries with it the velocity due\r\nto its revolution with the earth at a greater distance from the centre;\r\nit will therefore accelerate, although to an almost infinitesimal\r\nextent, the earth’s daily rotation. The sum of all these increments of\r\nvelocity, arising from the descent of all the rivers on the earth’s\r\nsurface, would in time become perceptible, did not nature, by the\r\nprocess of evaporation, raise the waters back to their sources, and\r\nthus, by again removing matter to a greater distance from the centre,\r\ndestroy the velocity generated by its previous approach; so that the\r\ndescent of rivers does not affect the earth’s rotation. Enormous masses\r\nprojected by volcanoes from the equator to the poles, and the contrary,\r\nwould indeed affect it, but there is no evidence of such convulsions.\r\nThe disturbing action of the moon and planets, which has so powerful an\r\neffect on the revolution of the earth, in no way influences its\r\nrotation. The constant friction of the trade winds on the mountains and\r\ncontinents between the tropics does not impede its velocity, which\r\ntheory even proves to be the same as if the sea, together with the\r\nearth, formed one solid mass. But, although these circumstances be\r\ninsufficient, a variation in the mean temperature would certainly\r\noccasion a corresponding change in the velocity of rotation. In the\r\nscience of dynamics it is a principle in a system of bodies or of\r\nparticles revolving about a fixed centre, that the momentum or sum of\r\nthe products of the mass of each into its angular velocity and distance\r\nfrom the centre is a constant quantity, if the system be not deranged by\r\na foreign cause. Now, since the number of particles in the system is the\r\nsame whatever its temperature may be, when their distances from the\r\ncentre are diminished, their angular velocity must be increased, in\r\norder that the preceding quantity may still remain constant. It follows,\r\nthen, that, as the primitive momentum of rotation with which the earth\r\nwas projected into space must necessarily remain the same, the smallest\r\ndecrease in heat, by contracting the terrestrial spheroid, would\r\naccelerate its rotation, and consequently diminish the length of the\r\nday. Notwithstanding the constant accession of heat from the sun’s rays,\r\ngeologists have been induced to believe, from the fossil remains, that\r\nthe mean temperature of the globe is decreasing.\r\n\r\nThe high temperature of mines, hot springs, and above all the internal\r\nfires which have produced, and do still occasion, such devastation on\r\nour planet, indicate an augmentation of heat towards its centre. The\r\nincrease of density corresponding to the depth and the form of the\r\nspheroid, being what theory assigns to a fluid mass in rotation, concurs\r\nto induce the idea that the temperature of the earth was originally so\r\nhigh as to reduce all the substances of which it is composed to a state\r\nof fusion or of vapour, and that in the course of ages it has cooled\r\ndown to its present state; that it is still becoming colder; and that it\r\nwill continue to do so till the whole mass arrives at the temperature of\r\nthe medium in which it is placed, or rather at a state of equilibrium\r\nbetween this temperature, the cooling power of its own radiation, and\r\nthe heating effect of the sun’s rays.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the formation of ice at the poles, the ancient lands of\r\nnorthern latitudes might, no doubt, have been capable of producing those\r\ntropical plants preserved in the coal-measures, if indeed such plants\r\ncould flourish without the intense light of a tropical sun. But, even if\r\nthe decreasing temperature of the earth be sufficient to produce the\r\nobserved effects, it must be extremely slow in its operation; for, in\r\nconsequence of the rotation of the earth being a measure of the periods\r\nof the celestial motions, it has been proved that, if the length of the\r\nday had decreased by the three-thousandth part of a second since the\r\nobservations of Hipparchus two thousand years ago, it would have\r\ndiminished the secular equation of the moon by 44ʺ·4. It is, therefore,\r\nbeyond a doubt that the mean temperature of the earth cannot have\r\nsensibly varied during that time. If, then, the appearances exhibited by\r\nthe strata are really owing to a decrease of internal temperature, it\r\neither shows the immense periods requisite to produce geological\r\nchanges, to which two thousand years are as nothing, or that the mean\r\ntemperature of the earth had arrived at a state of equilibrium before\r\nthese observations.\r\n\r\nHowever strong the indications of the primitive fluidity of the earth,\r\nas there is no direct proof of it, the hypothesis can only be regarded\r\nas very probable. But one of the most profound philosophers and elegant\r\nwriters of modern times has found in the secular variation of the\r\nexcentricity of the terrestrial orbit an evident cause of decreasing\r\ntemperature. That accomplished author, in pointing out the mutual\r\ndependencies of phenomena, says, “It is evident that the mean\r\ntemperature of the whole surface of the globe, in so far as it is\r\nmaintained by the action of the sun at a higher degree than it would\r\nhave were the sun extinguished, must depend on the mean quantity of the\r\nsun’s rays which it receives, or—which comes to the same thing—on the\r\ntotal quantity received in a given invariable time; and, the length of\r\nthe year being unchangeable in all the fluctuations of the planetary\r\nsystem, it follows that the total amount of solar radiation will\r\ndetermine, _cæteris paribus_, the general climate of the earth. Now, it\r\nis not difficult to show that this amount is inversely proportional to\r\nthe minor axis of the ellipse described by the earth about the sun\r\n(N. 143), regarded as slowly variable; and that, therefore, the major\r\naxis remaining, as we know it to be, constant, and the orbit being\r\nactually in a state of approach to a circle, and consequently the minor\r\naxis being on the increase, the mean annual amount of solar radiation\r\nreceived by the whole earth must be actually on the decrease. We have,\r\ntherefore, an evident real cause to account for the phenomenon.” The\r\nlimits of the variation in the excentricity of the earth’s orbit are\r\nunknown. But, if its ellipticity has ever been as great as that of the\r\norbit of Mercury or Pallas, the mean temperature of the earth must have\r\nbeen sensibly higher than it is at present. Whether it was great enough\r\nto render our northern climates fit for the production of tropical\r\nplants, and for the residence of the elephant and other animals now\r\ninhabitants of the torrid zone, it is impossible to say.\r\n\r\nOf the decrease in temperature of the northern hemisphere there is\r\nabundant evidence in the fossil plants discovered in very high\r\nlatitudes, which could only have existed in a tropical climate, and\r\nwhich must have grown near the spot where they are found, from the\r\ndelicacy of their structure and the perfect state of their preservation.\r\nThis change of temperature has been erroneously ascribed to an excess in\r\nthe duration of spring and summer in the northern hemisphere, in\r\nconsequence of the excentricity of the solar ellipse. The length of the\r\nseasons varies with the position of the perihelion (N. 64) of the\r\nearth’s orbit for two reasons. On account of the excentricity, small as\r\nit is, any line passing through the centre of the sun divides the\r\nterrestrial ellipse into two unequal parts, and by the laws of\r\nelliptical motion the earth moves through these two portions with\r\nunequal velocities. The perihelion always lies in the smaller portion,\r\nand there the earth’s motion is the most rapid. In the present position\r\nof the perihelion, spring and summer north of the equator exceed by\r\nabout eight days the duration of the same seasons south of it. And\r\n10,492 years ago the southern hemisphere enjoyed the advantage we now\r\npossess from the secular variation of the perihelion. Yet Sir John\r\nHerschel has shown that by this alternation neither hemisphere acquires\r\nany excess of light or heat above the other; for, although the earth is\r\nnearer to the sun while moving through that part of its orbit in which\r\nthe perihelion lies than in the other part, and consequently receives a\r\ngreater quantity of light and heat, yet as it moves faster it is exposed\r\nto the heat for a shorter time. In the other part of the orbit, on the\r\ncontrary, the earth, being farther from the sun, receives fewer of his\r\nrays; but because its motion is slower, it is exposed to them for a\r\nlonger time; and, as in both cases the quantity of heat and the angular\r\nvelocity vary exactly in the same proportion, a perfect compensation\r\ntakes place (N. 144). So that the excentricity of the earth’s orbit has\r\nlittle or no effect on the temperature corresponding to the difference\r\nof the seasons.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell, in his excellent works on Geology, refers the\r\nincreased cold of the northern hemisphere to the operation of existing\r\ncauses with more probability than most theories that have been advanced\r\nin solution of this difficult subject. The loftiest mountains would be\r\nrepresented by a grain of sand on a globe six feet in diameter, and the\r\ndepth of the ocean by a scratch on its surface. Consequently the gradual\r\nelevation of a continent or chain of mountains above the surface of the\r\nocean, or their depression below it, is no very great event compared\r\nwith the magnitude of the earth, and the energy of its subterranean\r\nfires, if the same periods of time be admitted in the progress of\r\ngeological as in astronomical phenomena, which the successive and\r\nvarious races of extinct beings show to have been immense. Climate is\r\nalways more intense in the interior of continents than in islands or\r\nsea-coasts. An increase of land within the tropics would therefore\r\naugment the general heat, and an increase in the temperate and frigid\r\nzones would render the cold more severe. Now it appears that most of the\r\nEuropean, North Asiatic, and North American continents and islands were\r\nraised from the deep after the coal-measures were formed in which the\r\nfossil tropical plants are found; and a variety of geological facts\r\nindicate the existence of an ancient and extensive archipelago\r\nthroughout the greater part of the northern hemisphere. Sir Charles\r\nLyell is therefore of opinion that the climate of these islands must\r\nhave been sufficiently mild, in consequence of the surrounding ocean, to\r\nclothe them with tropical plants, and render them a fit abode for the\r\nhuge animals whose fossil remains are so often found; that the\r\narborescent ferns and the palms of these regions, carried by streams to\r\nthe bottom of the ocean, were imbedded in the strata which were by\r\ndegrees heaved up by the subterranean fires during a long succession of\r\nages, till the greater part of the northern hemisphere became dry land\r\nas it now is, and that the consequence has been a continual decrease of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from the marine shells found on the tops of the highest\r\nmountains and in almost every part of the globe, that immense continents\r\nhave been elevated above the ocean which must have engulfed others. Such\r\na catastrophe would be occasioned by a variation in the position of the\r\naxis of rotation on the surface of the earth; for the seas tending to a\r\nnew equator would leave some portions of the globe and overwhelm others.\r\nNow, it is found by the laws of mechanics that in every body, be its\r\nform or density what it may, there are at least three axes at right\r\nangles to each other, round any one of which, if the solid begins to\r\nrotate, it will continue to revolve for ever, provided it be not\r\ndisturbed by a foreign cause, but that the rotation about any other axis\r\nwill only be for an instant, and consequently the poles or extremities\r\nof the instantaneous axis of rotation would perpetually change their\r\nposition on the surface of the body. In an ellipsoid of revolution the\r\npolar diameter and every diameter in the plane of the equator are the\r\nonly permanent axes of rotation (N. 145). Hence, if the ellipsoid were\r\nto begin to revolve about any diameter between the pole and the equator,\r\nthe motion would be so unstable that the axis of rotation and the\r\nposition of the poles would change every instant. Therefore, as the\r\nearth does not differ much from this figure, if it did not turn round\r\none of its principal axes, the position of the poles would change daily;\r\nthe equator, which is 90° distant, would undergo corresponding\r\nvariations; and the geographical latitudes of all places, being\r\nestimated from the equator, assumed to be fixed, would be perpetually\r\nchanging. A displacement in the position of the poles of only two\r\nhundred miles would be sufficient to produce these effects, and would\r\nimmediately be detected. But, as the latitudes are found to be\r\ninvariable, it may be concluded that the terrestrial spheroid must have\r\nrevolved about the same axis for ages. The earth and planets differ so\r\nlittle from ellipsoids of revolution, that in all probability any\r\nlibration from one axis to another, produced by the primitive impulse\r\nwhich put them in motion, must have ceased soon after their creation\r\nfrom the friction of the fluids at their surface.\r\n\r\nTheory also proves that neither nutation, precession, nor any of the\r\ndisturbing forces that affect the system, have the smallest influence on\r\nthe axis of rotation, which maintains a permanent position on the\r\nsurface, if the earth be not disturbed in its rotation by a foreign\r\ncause, as the collision of a comet, which might have happened in the\r\nimmensity of time. But, had that been the case, its effects would still\r\nhave been perceptible in the variations of the geographical latitudes.\r\nIf we suppose that such an event had taken place, and that the\r\ndisturbance had been very great, equilibrium could then only have been\r\nrestored with regard to a new axis of rotation by the rushing of the\r\nseas to the new equator, which they must have continued to do till the\r\nsurface was everywhere perpendicular to the direction of gravity. But it\r\nis probable that such an accumulation of the waters would not be\r\nsufficient to restore equilibrium if the derangement had been great, for\r\nthe mean density of the sea is only about a fifth part of the mean\r\ndensity of the earth, and the mean depth of the Pacific Ocean is\r\nsupposed not to be more than four or five miles, whereas the equatorial\r\ndiameter of the earth exceeds the polar diameter by about 26-1/2 miles.\r\nConsequently the influence of the sea on the direction of gravity is\r\nvery small. And, as it thus appears that a great change in the position\r\nof the axis is incompatible with the law of equilibrium, the geological\r\nphenomena in question must be ascribed to an internal cause. Indeed it\r\nis now demonstrated that the strata containing marine diluvia, which are\r\nin lofty situations, must have been formed at the bottom of the ocean,\r\nand afterwards upheaved by the action of subterraneous fires. Besides,\r\nit is clear, from the mensuration of the arcs of the meridian and the\r\nlength of the seconds’ pendulum, as well as from the lunar theory, that\r\nthe internal strata and also the external outline of the globe are\r\nelliptical, their centres being coincident and their axes identical with\r\nthat of the surface—a state of things which, according to the\r\ndistinguished author lately quoted, is incompatible with a subsequent\r\naccommodation of the surface to a new and different state of rotation\r\nfrom that which determined the original distribution of the component\r\nmatter. Thus, amidst the mighty revolutions which have swept innumerable\r\nraces of organized beings from the earth, which have elevated plains and\r\nburied mountains in the ocean, the rotation of the earth and the\r\nposition of the axes on its surface have undergone but slight\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\nThe strata of the terrestrial spheroid are not only concentric and\r\nelliptical, but the lunar inequalities show that they increase in\r\ndensity from the surface of the earth to its centre. This would\r\ncertainly have happened if the earth had originally been fluid, for the\r\ndenser parts must have subsided towards the centre as it approached a\r\nstate of equilibrium. But the enormous pressure of the superincumbent\r\nmass is a sufficient cause for the phenomenon. Professor Leslie observes\r\nthat air compressed into the fiftieth part of its volume has its\r\nelasticity fifty times augmented. If it continues to contract at that\r\nrate, it would, from its own incumbent weight, acquire the density of\r\nwater at the depth of thirty-four miles. But water itself would have its\r\ndensity doubled at the depth of ninety-three miles, and would even\r\nattain the density of quicksilver at a depth of 362 miles. Descending\r\ntherefore towards the centre through nearly 4000 miles, the condensation\r\nof ordinary substances would surpass the utmost powers of conception.\r\nDr. Young says that steel would be compressed into one-fourth and stone\r\ninto one-eighth of its bulk at the earth’s centre. However, we are yet\r\nignorant of the laws of compression of solid bodies beyond a certain\r\nlimit; from the experiments of Mr. Perkins they appear to be capable of\r\na greater degree of compression than has generally been imagined.\r\n\r\nBut a density so extreme is not borne out by astronomical observation.\r\nIt might seem to follow therefore that our planet must have a widely\r\ncavernous structure, and that we tread on a crust or shell whose\r\nthickness bears a very small proportion to the diameter of its sphere.\r\nPossibly, too, this great condensation at the central regions may be\r\ncounterbalanced by the increased elasticity due to a very elevated\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION XI.\r\n\r\nPrecession and Nutation—Their Effects on the Apparent Places of the\r\n  Fixed Stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT has been shown that the axis of rotation is invariable on the surface\r\nof the earth; and observation as well as theory prove that, were it not\r\nfor the action of the sun and moon on the matter at the equator, it\r\nwould remain exactly parallel to itself in every point of its orbit.\r\n\r\nThe attraction of an external body not only draws a spheroid towards it,\r\nbut, as the force varies inversely as the square of the distance, it\r\ngives it a motion about its centre of gravity, unless when the\r\nattracting body is situated in the prolongation of one of the axes of\r\nthe spheroid. The plane of the equator is inclined to the plane of the\r\necliptic at an angle of 23° 27ʹ 28ʺ·29; and the inclination of the lunar\r\norbit to the same is 5° 8ʹ 47ʺ·9. Consequently, from the oblate figure\r\nof the earth, the sun and moon, acting obliquely and unequally on the\r\ndifferent parts of the terrestrial spheroid, urge the plane of the\r\nequator from its direction, and force it to move from east to west, so\r\nthat the equinoctial points have a slow retrograde motion on the plane\r\nof the ecliptic of 50ʺ·41 annually. The direct tendency of this action\r\nis to make the planes of the equator and ecliptic coincide, but it is\r\nbalanced by the tendency of the earth to return to stable rotation about\r\nthe polar diameter, which is one of its principal axes of rotation.\r\nTherefore the inclination of the two planes remains constant, as a top\r\nspinning preserves the same inclination to the plane of the horizon.\r\nWere the earth spherical, this effect would not be produced, and the\r\nequinoxes would always correspond with the same points of the ecliptic,\r\nat least as far as this kind of motion is concerned. But another and\r\ntotally different cause which operates on this motion has already been\r\nmentioned. The action of the planets on one another and on the sun\r\noccasions a very slow variation in the position of the plane of the\r\necliptic, which affects its inclination to the plane of the equator, and\r\ngives the equinoctial points a slow but direct motion on the ecliptic of\r\n0ʺ·31 annually, which is entirely independent of the figure of the\r\nearth, and would be the same if it were a sphere. Thus the sun and moon\r\nby moving the plane of the equator cause the equinoctial points to\r\nretrograde on the ecliptic: and the planets by moving the plane of the\r\necliptic give them a direct motion, though much less than the former.\r\nConsequently the difference of the two is the mean precession, which is\r\nproved both by theory and observation to be about 50ʺ·1 annually\r\n(N. 146).\r\n\r\nAs the longitudes of all the fixed stars are increased by this quantity,\r\nthe effects of precession are soon detected. It was accordingly\r\ndiscovered by Hipparchus in the year 128 before Christ, from a\r\ncomparison of his own observations with those of Timocharis 155 years\r\nbefore. In the time of Hipparchus the entrance of the sun into the\r\nconstellation Aries was the beginning of spring; but since that time the\r\nequinoctial points have receded 30°, so that the constellations called\r\nthe signs of the zodiac are now at a considerable distance from those\r\ndivisions of the ecliptic which bear their names. Moving at the rate of\r\n50ʺ·1 annually, the equinoctial points will accomplish a revolution in\r\n25,868 years. But, as the precession varies in different centuries, the\r\nextent of this period will be slightly modified. Since the motion of the\r\nsun is direct, and that of the equinoctial points retrograde, he takes a\r\nshorter time to return to the equator than to arrive at the same stars;\r\nso that the tropical year of 365^d 5^h 48^m 49^s·7 must be increased\r\nby the time he takes to move through an arc of 50ʺ·1, in order to have\r\nthe length of the sidereal year. The time required is 20^m 19^s·6, so\r\nthat the sidereal year contains 365^d 6^h 9^m 9^s·6 mean solar days.\r\n\r\nThe mean annual precession is subject to a secular variation; for,\r\nalthough the change in the plane of the ecliptic in which the orbit of\r\nthe sun lies be independent of the form of the earth, yet, by bringing\r\nthe sun, moon, and earth into different relative positions from age to\r\nage, it alters the direct action of the two first on the prominent\r\nmatter at the equator: on this account the motion of the equinox is\r\ngreater by 0ʺ·455 now than it was in the time of Hipparchus.\r\nConsequently the actual length of the tropical year is about 4^s·21\r\nshorter than it was at that time. The utmost change that it can\r\nexperience from this cause amounts to 43 seconds.\r\n\r\nSuch is the secular motion of the equinoxes. But it is sometimes\r\nincreased and sometimes diminished by periodic variations, whose periods\r\ndepend upon the relative positions of the sun and moon with regard to\r\nthe earth, and which are occasioned by the direct action of these bodies\r\non the equator. Dr. Bradley discovered that by this action the moon\r\ncauses the pole of the equator to describe a small ellipse in the\r\nheavens, the axes of which are 18ʺ·5 and 13ʺ·674, the longer being\r\ndirected towards the pole of the ecliptic. The period of this inequality\r\nis about 19 years, the time employed by the nodes of the lunar orbit to\r\naccomplish a revolution. The sun causes a small variation in the\r\ndescription of this ellipse; it runs through its period in half a year.\r\nSince the whole earth obeys these motions, they affect the position of\r\nits axis of rotation with regard to the starry heavens, though not with\r\nregard to the surface of the earth; for in consequence of precession\r\nalone the pole of the equator moves in a circle round the pole of the\r\necliptic in 25,868 years, and by nutation alone it describes a small\r\nellipse in the heavens every 19 years, on each side of which it deviates\r\nevery half-year from the action of the sun. The real curve traced in the\r\nstarry heavens by the imaginary prolongation of the earth’s axis is\r\ncompounded of these three motions (N. 147). This nutation in the earth’s\r\naxis affects both the precession and obliquity with small periodic\r\nvariations. But in consequence of the secular variation in the position\r\nof the terrestrial orbit, which is chiefly owing to the disturbing\r\nenergy of Jupiter on the earth, the obliquity of the ecliptic is\r\nannually diminished, according to M. Bessel, by 0ʺ·457. This variation\r\nin the course of ages may amount to 10 or 11 degrees; but the obliquity\r\nof the ecliptic to the equator can never vary more than 2° 42ʹ or 3°,\r\nsince the equator will follow in some measure the motion of the\r\necliptic.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the places of all the celestial bodies are affected\r\nby precession and nutation. Their longitudes estimated from the equinox\r\nare augmented by precession; but, as it affects all the bodies equally,\r\nit makes no change in their relative positions. Both the celestial\r\nlatitudes and longitudes are altered to a small degree by nutation;\r\nhence all observations must be corrected for these inequalities. In\r\nconsequence of this real motion in the earth’s axis, the pole-star,\r\nforming part of the constellation of the Little Bear, which was formerly\r\n12° from the celestial pole, is now within 1° 24ʹ of it, and will\r\ncontinue to approach it till it is within 1/2°, after which it will\r\nretreat from the pole for ages; and 12,934 years hence the star α Lyræ\r\nwill come within 5° of the celestial pole, and become the polar star of\r\nthe northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION XII.\r\n\r\nMean and Apparent Sidereal Time—Mean and Apparent Solar Time—Equation of\r\n  Time—English and French Subdivisions of Time—Leap Year—Christian\r\n  Era—Equinoctial Time—Remarkable Eras depending upon the Position of\r\n  the Solar Perigee—Inequality of the Lengths of the Seasons in the two\r\n  Hemispheres—Application of Astronomy to Chronology—English and French\r\n  Standards of Weights and Measures.\r\n\r\n\r\nASTRONOMY has been of immediate and essential use in affording\r\ninvariable standards for measuring duration, distance, magnitude, and\r\nvelocity. The mean sidereal day measured by the time elapsed between two\r\nconsecutive transits of any star at the same meridian (N. 148), and the\r\nmean sidereal year which is the time included between two consecutive\r\nreturns of the sun to the same star, are immutable units with which all\r\ngreat periods of time are compared; the oscillations of the isochronous\r\npendulum measure its smaller portions. By these invariable standards\r\nalone we can judge of the slow changes that other elements of the system\r\nmay have undergone. Apparent sidereal time, which is measured by the\r\ntransit of the equinoctial point at the meridian of any place, is a\r\nvariable quantity, from the effects of precession and nutation. Clocks\r\nshowing apparent sidereal time are employed for observation, and are so\r\nregulated that they indicate 0^h 0^m 0^s at the instant the\r\nequinoctial point passes the meridian of the observatory. And as time is\r\na measure of angular motion, the clock gives the distances of the\r\nheavenly bodies from the equinox by observing the instant at which each\r\npasses the meridian, and converting the interval into arcs at the rate\r\nof 15° to an hour.\r\n\r\nThe returns of the sun to the meridian and to the same equinox or\r\nsolstice have been universally adopted as the measure of our civil days\r\nand years. The solar or astronomical day is the time that elapses\r\nbetween two consecutive noons or midnights. It is consequently longer\r\nthan the sidereal day, on account of the proper motion of the sun during\r\na revolution of the celestial sphere. But, as the sun moves with greater\r\nrapidity at the winter than at the summer solstice, the astronomical day\r\nis more nearly equal to the sidereal day in summer than in winter. The\r\nobliquity of the ecliptic also affects its duration; for near the\r\nequinoxes the arc of the equator is less than the corresponding arc of\r\nthe ecliptic, and in the solstices it is greater (N. 149). The\r\nastronomical day is therefore diminished in the first case, and\r\nincreased in the second. If the sun moved uniformly in the equator at\r\nthe rate of 59ʹ 8ʺ·33 every day, the solar days would be all equal. The\r\ntime therefore which is reckoned by the arrival of an imaginary sun at\r\nthe meridian, or of one which is supposed to move uniformly in the\r\nequator, is denominated mean solar time, and is given by clocks and\r\nwatches in common life. When it is reckoned by the arrival of the real\r\nsun at the meridian, it is true or apparent time, and is given by dials.\r\nThe difference between the time shown by a clock and a dial is the\r\nequation of time given in the Nautical Almanac, sometimes amounting to\r\nas much as sixteen minutes. The apparent and mean time coincide four\r\ntimes in the year; when the sun’s daily motion in right ascension is\r\nequal to 59ʹ 8ʺ·33 in a mean solar day, which happens about the 16th of\r\nApril, the 16th of June, the 1st of September, and the 25th of December.\r\n\r\nThe astronomical day begins at noon, but in common reckoning the day\r\nbegins at midnight. In England it is divided into twenty-four hours,\r\nwhich are counted by twelve and twelve; but in France astronomers,\r\nadopting the decimal division, divide the day into ten hours, the hour\r\ninto one hundred minutes, and the minute into a hundred seconds, because\r\nof the facility in computation, and in conformity with their decimal\r\nsystem of weights and measures. This subdivision is not now used in\r\ncommon life, nor has it been adopted in any other country; and although\r\nsome scientific writers in France still employ that division of time,\r\nthe custom is beginning to wear out. At one period during the French\r\nRevolution, the clock in the gardens of the Tuileries was regulated to\r\nshow decimal time. The mean length of the day, though accurately\r\ndetermined, is not sufficient for the purposes either of astronomy or\r\ncivil life. The tropical or civil year of 365^d 5^h 48^m 49^s·7,\r\nwhich is the time elapsed between the consecutive returns of the sun to\r\nthe mean equinoxes or solstices, including all the changes of the\r\nseasons, is a natural cycle peculiarly suited for a measure of duration.\r\nIt is estimated from the winter solstice, the middle of the long annual\r\nnight under the north pole. But although the length of the civil year is\r\npointed out by nature as a measure of long periods, the\r\nincommensurability that exists between the length of the day and the\r\nrevolution of the sun renders it difficult to adjust the estimation of\r\nboth in whole numbers. If the revolution of the sun were accomplished in\r\n365 days, all the years would be of precisely the same number of days,\r\nand would begin and end with the sun at the same point of the ecliptic.\r\nBut as the sun’s revolution includes the fraction of a day, a civil year\r\nand a revolution of the sun have not the same duration. Since the\r\nfraction is nearly the fourth of a day, in four years it is nearly equal\r\nto a revolution of the sun, so that the addition of a supernumerary day\r\nevery fourth year nearly compensates the difference. But in process of\r\ntime further correction will be necessary, because the fraction is less\r\nthan the fourth of a day. In fact, if a bissextile be suppressed at the\r\nend of three out of four centuries, the year so determined will only\r\nexceed the true year by an extremely small fraction of a day; and if in\r\naddition to this a bissextile be suppressed every 4000 years, the length\r\nof the year will be nearly equal to that given by observation. Were the\r\nfraction neglected, the beginning of the year would precede that of the\r\ntropical year, so that it would retrograde through the different seasons\r\nin a period of about 1507 years. The Egyptian year began with the\r\nheliacal rising of Sirius (N. 150), and contained only 365 days, by\r\nwhich they lost one year in every 1461 years, their Sothaic period, or\r\nthat cycle in which the heliacal rising of Sirius passes through the\r\nwhole year and takes place again on the same day. The division of the\r\nyear into months is very old and almost universal. But the period of\r\nseven days, by far the most permanent division of time, and the most\r\nancient monument of astronomical knowledge, was used by the Brahmins in\r\nIndia with the same denominations employed by us, and was alike found in\r\nthe calendars of the Jews, Egyptians, Arabs, and Assyrians. It has\r\nsurvived the fall of empires, and has existed among all successive\r\ngenerations, a proof of their common origin.\r\n\r\nThe day of the new moon immediately following the winter solstice in the\r\n707th year of Rome was made the 1st of January of the first year of\r\nJulius Cæsar. The 25th of December of his forty-fifth year is considered\r\nas the date of Christ’s nativity; and the forty-sixth year of the Julian\r\nCalendar is assumed to be the first of our era. The preceding year is\r\ncalled the first year before Christ by chronologists, but by astronomers\r\nit is called the year 0. The astronomical year begins on the 31st of\r\nDecember at noon; and the date of an observation expresses the days and\r\nhours which have actually elapsed since that time.\r\n\r\nSince solar and sidereal time are estimated from the passage of the sun\r\nand the equinoctial point across the meridian of each place, the hours\r\nare different at different places: while it is one o’clock at one place,\r\nit is two at another, three at another, &c.; for it is obvious that it\r\nis noon at one part of the globe at the same moment that it is midnight\r\nat another diametrically opposite to it: consequently an event which\r\nhappens at one and the same instant of absolute time is recorded at\r\ndifferent places as having happened at different times. Therefore, when\r\nobservations made at different places are to be compared, they must be\r\nreduced by computation to what they would have been had they been made\r\nunder the same meridian. To obviate this it was proposed by Sir John\r\nHerschel to employ mean equinoctial time, which is the same for all the\r\nworld, and independent alike of local circumstances and inequalities in\r\nthe sun’s motion. It is the time elapsed from the instant the mean sun\r\nenters the mean vernal equinox, and is reckoned in mean solar days and\r\nparts of a day.\r\n\r\nSome remarkable astronomical eras are determined by the position of the\r\nmajor axis of the solar ellipse, which depends upon the direct motion of\r\nthe perigee (N. 102) and the precession of the equinoxes conjointly, the\r\nannual motion of the one being 11ʺ·8, and that of the other 50ʺ·1. Hence\r\nthe axis, moving at the rate of 61ʺ·9 annually, accomplishes a tropical\r\nrevolution in 209·84 years. It coincided with the line of the equinoxes\r\n4000 or 4089 years before the Christian era, much about the time\r\nchronologists assign for the creation of man. In 6483 the major axis\r\nwill again coincide with the line of the equinoxes; but then the solar\r\nperigee will coincide with the equinox of autumn, whereas at the\r\ncreation of man it coincided with the vernal equinox. In the year 1246\r\nthe major axis was perpendicular to the line of the equinoxes; then the\r\nsolar perigee coincided with the solstice of summer, and the apogee with\r\nthe solstice of winter. According to La Place, who computed these\r\nperiods from different data, the last coincidence happened in the year\r\n1250 of our era, which induced him to propose that year as a universal\r\nepoch, the vernal equinox of the year 1250 to be the first day of the\r\nfirst year. These eras can only be regarded as approximate, since\r\nancient observations are too inaccurate, and modern observations too\r\nrecent, to afford data for their precise determination.\r\n\r\nThe variation in the position of the solar ellipse occasions\r\ncorresponding changes in the length of the seasons. In its present\r\nposition spring is shorter than summer, and autumn longer than winter;\r\nand while the solar perigee continues as it now is, between the solstice\r\nof winter and the equinox of spring, the period including spring and\r\nsummer will be longer than that including autumn and winter. In this\r\ncentury the difference is between seven and eight days. The intervals\r\nwill be equal towards the year 6483, when the perigee will coincide with\r\nthe equinox of spring; but, when it passes that point, the spring and\r\nsummer taken together will be shorter than the period including the\r\nautumn and winter (N. 151). These changes will be accomplished in a\r\ntropical revolution of the major axis of the earth’s orbit, which\r\nincludes an interval of 20,984 years. Were the orbit circular, the\r\nseasons would be equal; their difference arises from the excentricity of\r\nthe orbit, small as it is; but the changes are so trifling as to be\r\nimperceptible in the short span of human life.\r\n\r\nNo circumstance in the whole science of astronomy excites a deeper\r\ninterest than its application to chronology. “Whole nations,” says La\r\nPlace, “have been swept from the earth, with their languages, arts, and\r\nsciences, leaving but confused masses of ruins to mark the place where\r\nmighty cities stood; their history, with the exception of a few doubtful\r\ntraditions, has perished; but the perfection of their astronomical\r\nobservations marks their high antiquity, fixes the periods of their\r\nexistence, and proves that, even at that early time, they must have made\r\nconsiderable progress in science.” The ancient state of the heavens may\r\nnow be computed with great accuracy; and, by comparing the results of\r\ncalculation with ancient observations, the exact period at which they\r\nwere made may be verified if true, or, if false, their error may be\r\ndetected. If the date be accurate and the observation good, it will\r\nverify the accuracy of modern tables, and will show to how many\r\ncenturies they may be extended without the fear of error. A few examples\r\nwill show the importance of the subject.\r\n\r\nAt the solstices the sun is at his greatest distance from the equator;\r\nconsequently his declination at these times is equal to the obliquity of\r\nthe ecliptic (N. 152), which was formerly determined from the meridian\r\nlength of the shadow of the stile of a dial on the day of a solstice.\r\nThe lengths of the meridian shadow at the summer and winter solstices\r\nare recorded to have been observed at the city of Layang, in China, 1100\r\nyears before the Christian era. From these the distances of the sun from\r\nthe zenith (N. 153) of the city of Layang are known. Half the sum of\r\nthese zenith distances determines the latitude, and half their\r\ndifference gives the obliquity of the ecliptic at the period of the\r\nobservation; and, as the law of the variation of the obliquity is known,\r\nboth the time and place of the observations have been verified by\r\ncomputations from modern tables. Thus the Chinese had made some advances\r\nin the science of astronomy at that early period. Their whole chronology\r\nis founded on the observations of eclipses, which prove the existence of\r\nthat empire for more than 4700 years. The epoch of the lunar tables of\r\nthe Indians, supposed by Bailly to be 3000 years before the Christian\r\nera, was proved by La Place, from the acceleration of the moon, not to\r\nbe more ancient than the time of Ptolemy, who lived in the second\r\ncentury after it. The great inequality of Jupiter and Saturn, whose\r\ncycle embraces 918 years, is peculiarly fitted for marking the\r\ncivilization of a people. The Indians had determined the mean motions of\r\nthese two planets in that part of their periods when the apparent mean\r\nmotion of Saturn was at the slowest, and that of Jupiter the most rapid.\r\nThe periods in which that happened were 3102 years before the Christian\r\nera, and the year 1491 after it. The returns of comets to their\r\nperihelia may possibly mark the present state of astronomy to future\r\nages.\r\n\r\nThe places of the fixed stars are affected by the precession of the\r\nequinoxes; and, as the law of that variation is known, their positions\r\nat any time may be computed. Now Eudoxus, a contemporary of Plato,\r\nmentions a star situate in the pole of the equator, and it appears from\r\ncomputation that χ Draconis was not very far from that place about 3000\r\nyears ago; but, as it is only about 2150 years since Eudoxus lived, he\r\nmust have described an anterior state of the heavens, supposed to be the\r\nsame that was mentioned by Chiron about the time of the siege of Troy.\r\nThus every circumstance concurs in showing that astronomy was cultivated\r\nin the highest ages of antiquity.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that a knowledge of astronomy may lead to the\r\ninterpretation of hieroglyphical characters. Astronomical signs are\r\noften found on the ancient Egyptian monuments, probably employed by the\r\npriests to record dates. The author had occasion to witness an instance\r\nof this most interesting application of astronomy, in ascertaining the\r\ndate of a papyrus, sent from Egypt by Mr. Salt, in the hieroglyphical\r\nresearches of the late Dr. Thomas Young, whose profound and varied\r\nacquirements do honour to his country, and to the age in which he lived.\r\nThe manuscript was found in a mummy case; it proved to be a horoscope of\r\nthe age of Ptolemy, and its date was determined from the configuration\r\nof the heavens at the time of its construction.\r\n\r\nThe form of the earth furnishes a standard of weights and measures for\r\nthe ordinary purposes of life, as well as for the determination of the\r\nmasses and distances of the heavenly bodies. The length of the pendulum\r\nvibrating seconds of mean solar time, in the latitude of London, forms\r\nthe standard of the British measure of extension. Its approximate length\r\noscillating in vacuo at the temperature of 62° of Fahrenheit, and\r\nreduced to the level of the sea (N. 154), was determined by Captain\r\nKater to be 39·1393 inches. The weight of a cubic inch of water at the\r\ntemperature of 62° of Fahrenheit, barometer 30 inches, was also\r\ndetermined in parts of the imperial troy pound, whence a standard both\r\nof weight and capacity was deduced. The French have adopted the mètre,\r\nequal to 3·2808992 English feet, for their unit of linear measure, which\r\nis the ten-millionth part of the arc of the meridian which extends from\r\nthe equator to the pole, as deduced from the measures of the separate\r\narc extending from Formentera, the most southern of the Balearic\r\nIslands, to Dunkirk. Should the national standards of the two countries\r\never be lost, both may be recovered, since they are derived from natural\r\nand invariable ones. The length of the measure deduced from that of the\r\npendulum would be found again with more facility than the mètre. But, as\r\nno measure is mathematically exact, an error in the original standard\r\nmay at length become sensible in measuring a great extent, whereas the\r\nerror that must necessarily arise in measuring the quadrant of the\r\nmeridian (N. 155) is rendered totally insensible by subdivision in\r\ntaking its ten-millionth part. The French have adopted the decimal\r\ndivision, not only in time, but also in their degrees, weights, and\r\nmeasures, on account of the very great facility it affords in\r\ncomputation. It has not been adopted by any other country, though\r\nnothing is more desirable than that all nations should concur in using\r\nthe same standards, not only on account of convenience, but as affording\r\na more definite idea of quantity. It is singular that the decimal\r\ndivision of the day, of space, weights, and measures, was employed in\r\nChina 4000 years ago; and that at the time Ibn Junis made his\r\nobservations at Cairo, about the year 1000 of the Christian era, the\r\nArabs were in the habit of employing the vibrations of the pendulum in\r\ntheir astronomical observations as a measure of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION XIII.\r\n\r\nTides—Forces that produce them—Origin and Course of Tidal Wave—Its\r\n  Speed—Three kinds of Oscillations in the Ocean—The Semidiurnal\r\n  Tides—Equinoctial Tides—Effects of the Declination of the Sun and\r\n  Moon—Theory insufficient without Observation—Direction of the Tidal\r\n  Wave—Height of Tides—Mass of Moon obtained from her Action on the\r\n  Tides—Interference of Undulations—Impossibility of a Universal\r\n  Inundation—Currents.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE of the most immediate and remarkable effects of a gravitating force\r\nexternal to the earth is the alternate rise and fall of the surface of\r\nthe sea twice in the course of a lunar day, or 24^h 50^m 28^s of mean\r\nsolar time. As it depends upon the action of the sun and moon, it is\r\nclassed among astronomical problems, of which it is by far the most\r\ndifficult and its explanation the least satisfactory. The form of the\r\nsurface of the ocean in equilibrio, when revolving with the earth round\r\nits axis, is an ellipsoid flattened at the poles; but the action of the\r\nsun and moon, especially of the moon, disturbs the equilibrium of the\r\nocean. If the moon attracted the centre of gravity of the earth and all\r\nits particles with equal and parallel forces, the whole system of the\r\nearth and the waters that cover it would yield to these forces with a\r\ncommon motion, and the equilibrium of the seas would remain undisturbed.\r\nThe difference of the forces and the inequality of their directions\r\nalone disturb the equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThe particles of water under the moon are more attracted than the centre\r\nof gravity of the earth, in the inverse ratio of the square of the\r\ndistance. Hence they have a tendency to leave the earth, but are\r\nretained by their gravitation, which is diminished by this tendency. On\r\nthe contrary, the moon attracts the centre of the earth more powerfully\r\nthan she attracts the particles of water in the hemisphere opposite to\r\nher; so that the earth has a tendency to leave the waters, but is\r\nretained by gravitation, which is again diminished by this tendency.\r\nThus the waters immediately under the moon are drawn from the earth, at\r\nthe same time that the earth is drawn from those which are diametrically\r\nopposite to her, in both instances producing an elevation of the ocean\r\nof nearly the same height above the surface of equilibrium; for the\r\ndiminution of the gravitation of the particles in each position is\r\nalmost the same, on account of the distance of the moon being great in\r\ncomparison of the radius of the earth. Were the earth entirely covered\r\nby the sea, the waters thus attracted by the moon would assume the form\r\nof an oblong spheroid whose greater axis would point towards the moon;\r\nsince the columns of water under the moon, and in the direction\r\ndiametrically opposite to her, are rendered lighter in consequence of\r\nthe diminution of their gravitation; and, in order to preserve the\r\nequilibrium, the axes 90° distant would be shortened. The elevation, on\r\naccount of the smaller space to which it is confined, is twice as great\r\nas the depression, because the contents of the spheroid always remain\r\nthe same. If the waters were capable of assuming the form of equilibrium\r\ninstantaneously, that is, the form of the spheroid, its summit would\r\nalways point to the moon notwithstanding the earth’s rotation. But, on\r\naccount of their resistance, the rapid motion produced in them by\r\nrotation prevents them from assuming at every instant the form which the\r\nequilibrium of the forces acting upon them requires. Hence, on account\r\nof the inertia of the waters, if the tides be considered relatively to\r\nthe whole earth and open seas, there is a meridian about 30° eastward of\r\nthe moon, where it is always high water both in the hemisphere where the\r\nmoon is and in that which is opposite. On the west side of this circle\r\nthe tide is flowing, on the east it is ebbing, and on every part of the\r\nmeridian at 90° distant it is low water. This great wave, which follows\r\nall the motions of the moon as far as the rotation of the earth will\r\npermit, is modified by the action of the sun, the effects of whose\r\nattraction are in every respect like those produced by the moon, though\r\ngreatly less in degree. Consequently a similar wave, but much smaller,\r\nraised by the sun, tends to follow his motions, which at times combines\r\nwith the lunar wave, and at others opposes it, according to the relative\r\npositions of the two luminaries; but as the lunar wave is only modified\r\na little by the solar, the tides must necessarily happen twice in a day,\r\nsince the rotation of the earth brings the same point twice under the\r\nmeridian of the moon in that time, once under the superior and once\r\nunder the inferior meridian.\r\n\r\nThe periodic motions of the waters of the ocean, on the hypothesis of an\r\nellipsoid of revolution, entirely covered by the sea, are, however, very\r\nfar from according with observation. This arises from the great\r\nirregularities in the surface of the earth, which is but partially\r\ncovered by the sea, from the variety in the depths of the ocean, the\r\nmanner in which it is spread out on the earth, the position and\r\ninclination of the shores, the currents, and the resistance which the\r\nwaters meet with: causes impossible to estimate generally, but which\r\nmodify the oscillations of the great mass of the ocean. However, amidst\r\nall these irregularities, the ebb and flow of the sea maintain a ratio\r\nto the forces producing them sufficient to indicate their nature, and to\r\nverify the law of the attraction of the sun and moon on the sea. La\r\nPlace observes, that the investigation of such relations between cause\r\nand effect is no less useful in natural philosophy than the direct\r\nsolution of problems, either to prove the existence of the causes or to\r\ntrace the laws of their effects. Like the theory of probabilities, it is\r\na happy supplement to the ignorance and weakness of the human mind.\r\n\r\nSince the disturbing action of the sun and moon can only become sensible\r\nin a very great extent of deep water, the Antarctic Ocean is the origin\r\nand birthplace of our tides. A succession of tidal waves from that\r\nsource follow one another in a north-westerly direction down the Pacific\r\nand Atlantic Oceans, modified as they proceed by the depth of the water\r\nand the form of the coasts. For when the sun and moon are in the same\r\nmeridian, and pass over the mass of waters lying east from Van Diemen’s\r\nLand, New Zealand, and the South Pole, the resulting force of their\r\ncombined attraction, penetrating to the abyss of the deep and boundless\r\ncircuit of the Southern Ocean, raises a vast wave or ridge of water,\r\nwhich tends to follow the luminaries to the north and west, and\r\ncontinues to flow in that direction long after the bodies cease to act\r\nupon it; but it is so retarded by the rotation of the earth and by the\r\ninertia of the water, that it does not arrive at the different parts of\r\nthe coasts till after the moon’s southing (N. 156). When this tidal wave\r\nleaves the Antarctic Ocean and enters the Pacific, it rushes along the\r\nwestern coast of America to its farthest end, but it is so much\r\nobstructed by the number of islands in the middle of that ocean that it\r\nis hardly perceptible among them; while on the east it enters the Indian\r\nOcean, strikes with violence on the coasts of Hindostan and the shores\r\nat the mouths of the Ganges, and causes the terrific bore in the Hoogly.\r\nThe part of this tidal wave that enters the Atlantic passes impetuously\r\nalong the coasts of Africa and America, arriving later and later at each\r\nplace. It is modified, however, by a tide raised in the Atlantic, which\r\nis deep and free from islands; and this combined tidal wave, still\r\ncoming northward, pours its surge into the Gulf of Fundy to the height\r\nof fifty feet; then being deflected by the coast of America at right\r\nangles, it rushes eastward, bringing high water to the western coasts of\r\nIreland and England. It then goes round Scotland, brings high water to\r\nAberdeen and the opposite coasts of Norway and Denmark, and, continuing\r\nits course to the south, arrives at the mouth of the Thames and fills\r\nthe channels of that river on the morning of the third day after leaving\r\nthe Antarctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nThus the tides in our ports are owing to an impulse from the waters of\r\nthe Antarctic seas raised by the action of the sun and moon. No doubt a\r\nsimilar action raised that tide in the North Polar Ocean which Dr. Kane\r\nsaw rolling on the northern coast of Greenland in 82° N. latitude, but\r\nwhich, in the present state of the globe, is imprisoned by bars of ice\r\nand ice-bound lands.\r\n\r\nThe tidal wave extends to the bottom of the ocean, and moves uniformly\r\nand with great speed in very deep water, variably and slow in shallow\r\nwater; the time of propagation depends upon the depth of the sea, as\r\nwell as on the nature and form of the coasts. It varies inversely as the\r\nsquare of the depth—a law which theoretically affords the means of\r\nascertaining the proportionate depth of the sea in different parts. It\r\nis one of the great constants of nature, and is to fluids what the\r\npendulum is to solids—a connecting link between time and force.\r\n\r\nFor example: the tidal wave moves across the Southern Ocean with the\r\nvelocity of 1000 miles an hour, and in the Atlantic it is scarcely less\r\non account of the deep trough which runs through the centre of that\r\nocean; but the sea is so shallow on the British coast that it takes more\r\ntime to come from Aberdeen to London than to travel over an arc of 120°,\r\nbetween 60° S. lat. and 60° N. lat.\r\n\r\nIn deep water the tidal wave is merely a rise and fall of the surface;\r\nthe water does not advance, though the wave does. Indeed, if so heavy a\r\nbody as water were to move at the rate of 1000 miles an hour, it would\r\ncause universal destruction, since in the most violent hurricanes the\r\nvelocity of the wind is little more than 100 miles an hour. Besides, it\r\nis evident that no ship could either sail or steam against it. When the\r\nwater is shallow, however, there is a motion of translation in the water\r\nalong with the tide.\r\n\r\nIn the deep ocean the undulating motion consists of two distinct\r\nthings—an advancing form and a molecular movement. The motion of each\r\nparticle of water is in an ellipse lying wholly in the vertical plane;\r\nso that, after the momentary displacement during the passage of the\r\nwave, they return to their places again. The resistance of the sea-bed\r\nis insensible in deep water; but when the tidal wave, which extends to\r\nthe very bottom of the ocean, comes into shallow water with diminished\r\nvelocity, the particles of water moving in vertical ellipses strike the\r\nbottom, and by reaction the wave rises higher; and that being\r\ncontinually repeated, as the form moves on the wave rises higher and\r\nhigher, bends more and more forward, till at last it loses its\r\nequilibrium, and then both form and water roll to the shore, and the\r\nelliptical trajectories of the particles, which in deep water were\r\nvertical, incline more and more, till at length they become horizontal.\r\nThe distance from the shore at which the water begins to be translated\r\ndepends upon the depth, the nature of the coast, and the form of the\r\nshore. Mr. Scott Russell has demonstrated that in shallow water the\r\nvelocity of the wave is equal to that which a heavy body falling freely\r\nby its gravity would acquire in descending through half the depth of the\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\nIt is proved by daily experience, as well as by strict mathematical\r\nreasoning, that, if a number of waves or oscillations be excited in a\r\nfluid by different forces, each pursues its course and has its effect\r\nindependently of the rest. Now, in the tides there are three kinds of\r\noscillations, depending on different causes, and producing their effects\r\nindependently of each other, which may therefore be estimated\r\nseparately. The oscillations of the first kind, which are very small,\r\nare independent of the rotation of the earth, and, as they depend upon\r\nthe motion of the disturbing body in its orbit, they are of long\r\nperiods. The second kind of oscillations depend upon the rotation of the\r\nearth, therefore their period is nearly a day. The oscillations of the\r\nthird kind vary with an angle equal to twice the angular rotation of the\r\nearth, and consequently happen twice in twenty-four hours (N. 157). The\r\nfirst afford no particular interest, and are extremely small; but the\r\ndifference of two consecutive tides depends upon the second. At the time\r\nof the solstices this difference, which ought to be very great according\r\nto Newton’s theory, is hardly sensible on our shores. La Place has shown\r\nthat the discrepancy arises from the depth of the sea, and that if the\r\ndepth were uniform there would be no difference in the consecutive tides\r\nbut that which is occasioned by local circumstances. It follows,\r\ntherefore, that, as this difference is extremely small, the sea,\r\nconsidered in a large extent, must be nearly of uniform depth, that is\r\nto say, there is a certain mean depth from which the deviation is not\r\ngreat. The mean depth of the Pacific Ocean is supposed to be about four\r\nor five miles, that of the Atlantic only three or four, which, however,\r\nis mere conjecture. Possibly the great extent and uniformly small depth\r\nof the Atlantic over the telegraphic platform may prevent the difference\r\nof the oscillations in question from being perceptible on our shores.\r\nFrom the formulæ which determine the difference of these consecutive\r\ntides it is proved that the precession of the equinoxes and the nutation\r\nof the earth’s axis are the same as if the sea formed one solid mass\r\nwith the earth.\r\n\r\nThe oscillations of the third kind are the semi-diurnal tides so\r\nremarkable on our coasts. In these there are two phenomena particularly\r\nto be distinguished, one occurring twice in a month, the other twice in\r\na year.\r\n\r\nThe first phenomenon is, that the tides are much increased in the\r\nsyzygies (N. 158), or at the time of new and full moon: in both cases\r\nthe sun and moon are in the same meridian; for when the moon is new they\r\nare in conjunction, and when she is full they are in opposition. In each\r\nof these positions their action is combined to produce the highest or\r\nspring tides under that meridian, and the lowest in those points that\r\nare 90° distant. It is observed that the higher the sea rises in full\r\ntide, the lower it is in the ebb. The neap tides take place when the\r\nmoon is in quadrature. They neither rise so high nor sink so low as the\r\nspring tides. It is evident that the spring tides must happen twice in a\r\nmonth, since in that time the moon is once new and once full. Theory\r\nproves that each partial tide increases as the cube of the parallax or\r\napparent diameter of the body producing it, for the greater the apparent\r\ndiameter the nearer the body and the more intense its action upon the\r\nsea; hence the spring tides are much increased when the moon is in\r\nperigee, for then she is nearest to the earth.\r\n\r\nThe second phenomenon in the tides is the augmentation occurring at the\r\ntime of the equinoxes, when the sun’s declination is zero (N. 159),\r\nwhich happens twice in every year. The spring tides which take place at\r\nthat time are often much increased by the equinoctial gales, and, on the\r\nhypothesis of the whole earth covered by the ocean, would be the\r\ngreatest possible if the line of the moon’s nodes coincided with that of\r\nher perigee, for then the whole action of the luminaries would be in the\r\nplane of the equator. But since the Antarctic Ocean is the source of the\r\ntides, it is evident that the spring tide must be greatest when the moon\r\nis in perigee, and when both luminaries have their highest southern\r\ndeclination, for then they act most directly upon the great circuit of\r\nthe south polar seas.\r\n\r\nThe sun and moon are continually making the circuit of the heavens at\r\ndifferent distances from the plane of the equator, on account of the\r\nobliquity of the ecliptic and the inclination of the lunar orbit. The\r\nmoon takes about 29-1/2 days to vary through all her declinations, which\r\nsometimes extend 28-3/4° on each side of the equator, while the sun\r\nrequires nearly 365-1/4 days to accomplish his motions through 23-1/2°\r\non each side of the same plane, so that their combined action causes\r\ngreat variations in the tides. Both the height and time of high water\r\nare perpetually changing, and, although the problem does not admit of a\r\ngeneral solution, it is necessary to analyse the phenomena which ought\r\nto arise from the attraction of the sun and moon, but the result must be\r\ncorrected in each particular case for local circumstances, so that the\r\ntheory of the tides in each port becomes really a matter of experiment,\r\nand can only be determined by means of a vast number of observations,\r\nincluding many revolutions of the moon’s nodes.\r\n\r\nThe mean height of the tides will be increased by a very small quantity\r\nfor ages to come, in consequence of the decrease in the mean distance of\r\nthe moon from the earth; the contrary effect will take place after that\r\nperiod has elapsed, and the moon’s mean distance begins to increase\r\nagain, which it will continue to do for many ages. Thus the mean\r\ndistance of the moon and the consequent minute increase in the height of\r\nthe tides will oscillate between fixed limits for ever.\r\n\r\nThe height to which the tides rise is much greater in narrow channels\r\nthan in the open sea, on account of the obstructions they meet with. The\r\nsea is so pent up in the British Channel that the tides sometimes rise\r\nas much as fifty feet at St. Malo, on the coast of France; whereas on\r\nthe shores of some of the South Sea islands, near the centre of the\r\nPacific, they do not exceed one or two feet. The winds have great\r\ninfluence on the height of the tides, according as they conspire with or\r\noppose them. But the actual effect of the wind in exciting the waves of\r\nthe ocean extends very little below the surface. Even in the most\r\nviolent storms the water is probably calm at the depth of ninety or a\r\nhundred fathoms. The tidal wave of the ocean does not reach the\r\nMediterranean nor the Baltic, partly from their position and partly from\r\nthe narrowness of the Straits of Gibraltar and of the Categat, but it is\r\nvery perceptible in the Red Sea and in Hudson’s Bay. The ebb and flow of\r\nthe sea are perceptible in rivers to a very great distance from their\r\nestuaries. In the Narrows of Pauxis, in the river of the Amazons, more\r\nthan five hundred miles from the sea, the tides are evident. It requires\r\nso many days for the tide to ascend this mighty stream, that the\r\nreturning tides meet a succession of those which are coming up; so that\r\nevery possible variety occurs at some part or other of its shores, both\r\nas to magnitude and time. It requires a very wide expanse of water to\r\naccumulate the impulse of the sun and moon, so as to render their\r\ninfluence sensible; on that account the tides in the Mediterranean and\r\nBlack Sea are scarcely perceptible.\r\n\r\nThese perpetual commotions in the waters are occasioned by forces that\r\nbear a very small proportion to terrestrial gravitation: the sun’s\r\naction in raising the ocean is only the 1/38448000 of gravitation at the\r\nearth’s surface, and the action of the moon is little more than twice as\r\nmuch; these forces being in the ratio of 1 to 2.35333, when the sun and\r\nmoon are at their mean distances from the earth. From this ratio the\r\nmass of the moon is found to be only the 1/75 part of that of the earth.\r\nHad the action of the sun on the ocean been exactly equal to that of the\r\nmoon, there would have been no neap tides, and the spring tides would\r\nhave been of twice the height which the action of either the sun or moon\r\nwould have produced separately—a phenomenon depending upon the\r\ninterference of the waves or undulations.\r\n\r\nA stone plunged into a pool of still water occasions a series of waves\r\nto advance along the surface, though the water itself is not carried\r\nforward, but only rises into heights and sinks into hollows, each\r\nportion of the surface being elevated and depressed in its turn. Another\r\nstone of the same size, thrown into the water near the first, will\r\noccasion a similar set of undulations. Then, if an equal and similar\r\nwave from each stone arrive at the same spot at the same time, so that\r\nthe elevation of the one exactly coincides with the elevation of the\r\nother, their united effect will produce a wave twice the size of either.\r\nBut, if one wave precede the other by exactly half an undulation, the\r\nelevation of the one will coincide with the hollow of the other, and the\r\nhollow of the one with the elevation of the other; and the waves will so\r\nentirely obliterate one another, that the surface of the water will\r\nremain smooth and level. Hence, if the length of each wave be\r\nrepresented by 1, they will destroy one another at intervals of 1/2,\r\n3/2, 5/2, &c., and will combine their effects at the intervals 1, 2, 3,\r\n&c. It will be found according to this principle, when still water is\r\ndisturbed by the fall of two equal stones, that there are certain lines\r\non its surface of a hyperbolic form, where the water is smooth in\r\nconsequence of the waves obliterating each other, and that the elevation\r\nof the water in the adjacent parts corresponds to both the waves united\r\n(N. 160). Now, in the spring and neap tides arising from the combination\r\nof the simple solilunar waves, the spring tide is the joint result of\r\nthe combination when they coincide in time and place; and the neap tide\r\nhappens when they succeed each other by half an interval, so as to leave\r\nonly the effect of their difference sensible. It is, therefore, evident\r\nthat, if the solar and lunar tides were of the same height, there would\r\nbe no difference, consequently no neap tides, and the spring tides would\r\nbe twice as high as either separately. In the port of Batsha, in\r\nTonquin, where the tides arrive by two channels of lengths corresponding\r\nto half an interval, there is neither high nor low water on account of\r\nthe interference of the waves.\r\n\r\nThe initial state of the ocean has no influence on the tides; for,\r\nwhatever its primitive conditions may have been, they must soon have\r\nvanished by the friction and mobility of the fluid. One of the most\r\nremarkable circumstances in the theory of the tides is the assurance\r\nthat, in consequence of the density of the sea being only one-fifth of\r\nthe mean density of the earth, and the earth itself increasing in\r\ndensity towards the centre, the stability of the equilibrium of the\r\nocean never can be subverted by any physical cause. A general inundation\r\narising from the mere instability of the ocean is therefore impossible.\r\nA variety of circumstances, however, tend to produce partial variations\r\nin the equilibrium of the seas, which is restored by means of currents.\r\nWinds and the periodical melting of the ice at the poles occasion\r\ntemporary watercourses; but by far the most important causes are the\r\ncentrifugal force induced by the velocity of the earth’s rotation, and\r\nvariations in the density of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe centrifugal force may be resolved into two forces—one perpendicular,\r\nand another tangent to the earth’s surface (N. 161). The tangential\r\nforce, though small, is sufficient to make the fluid particles within\r\nthe polar circles tend towards the equator, and the tendency is much\r\nincreased by the immense evaporation in the equatorial regions from the\r\nheat of the sun, which disturbs the equilibrium of the ocean. To this\r\nmay also be added the superior density of the waters near the poles,\r\nfrom their low temperature. In consequence of the combination of all\r\nthese circumstances, two great currents perpetually set from each pole\r\ntowards the equator. But, as they come from latitudes where the rotatory\r\nmotion of the surface of the earth is very much less than it is between\r\nthe tropics, on account of their inertia, they do not immediately\r\nacquire the velocity with which the solid part of the earth’s surface is\r\nrevolving at the equatorial regions; from whence it follows that, within\r\ntwenty-five or thirty degrees on each side of the line, the ocean has a\r\ngeneral motion from east to west, which is much increased by the action\r\nof the trade winds. Both in the Pacific and Atlantic currents of\r\nenormous magnitude are deflected by the continents and islands to the\r\nnorth and south from this mighty mass of rushing waters, which convey\r\nthe warmth of the equator to temper the severity of the polar regions,\r\nwhile to maintain the equilibrium of the seas counter currents of cold\r\nwater are poured from the polar oceans to mingle with the warm waters at\r\nthe line, so that a perpetual circulation is maintained.\r\n\r\nIcebergs are sometimes drifted as far as the Azores from the Polar seas,\r\nand from the south pole they have come even to the Cape of Good Hope.\r\nBut the ice which encircles the south pole extends to lower latitudes by\r\n10° than that which surrounds the north. In consequence of the polar\r\ncurrent Sir Edward Parry was obliged to give up his attempt to reach the\r\nnorth pole in the year 1827, because the fields of ice were drifting to\r\nthe south faster than his party could travel over them to the north.\r\n\r\nKotzebue and Sir James Ross found a stratum of constant temperature in\r\nthe ocean at a depth depending upon the latitude: at the equator it is\r\nat the depth of 7200 feet, from whence it gradually rises till it comes\r\nto the surface in both hemispheres about the latitude of 56° 26ʹ, where\r\nthe water has the same temperature at all depths; it then descends to\r\n4500 feet below the surface about the 70th parallel both in the Arctic\r\nand Antarctic Seas. The temperature of that aqueous zone is about 39°·5\r\nof Fahrenheit.[7] It divides the surface of the ocean into five great\r\nzones of temperature, namely, a medial region, in which the highest mean\r\ntemperature is 82° Fahr., two temperate zones each of 39°·5 Fahr., and\r\ntwo polar basins at the freezing point of salt water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION XIV.\r\n\r\nMolecular Forces—Permanency of the ultimate Particles of\r\n  Matter—Interstices—Mossotti’s Theory—Rankin’s Theory of Molecular\r\n  Vortices—Gases reduced to Liquids by Pressure—Gravitation of\r\n  Particles—Cohesion—Crystallization—Cleavage—Isomorphism—Minuteness of\r\n  the Particles—Height of Atmosphere—Chemical Affinity—Definite\r\n  Proportions and Relative Weights of Atoms—Faraday’s Discovery with\r\n  regard to Affinity—Capillary Attraction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE oscillations of the atmosphere, and its action upon the rays of\r\nlight coming from the heavenly bodies, connect the science of astronomy\r\nwith the equilibrium and movements of fluids and the laws of molecular\r\nattraction. Hitherto that force has been under consideration which acts\r\nupon masses of matter at sensible distances; but now the effects of such\r\nforces are to be considered as act at inappreciable distances upon the\r\nultimate molecules of material bodies.\r\n\r\nAll substances consist of an assemblage of material particles, or\r\nmolecules, which are far too small to be visible by any means human\r\ningenuity has yet been able to devise, and which are much beyond the\r\nlimits of our perceptions. They neither can be created nor destroyed;\r\nbodies may be burned, but their particles are not consumed—they are\r\nmerely liberated from one combination to enter into another, nor are\r\ntheir peculiar properties ever changed; whatever combinations they may\r\nenter into, they are ever and invariably the same.\r\n\r\nSince every known substance may be reduced in bulk by pressure, it\r\nfollows that the particles of matter are not in actual contact, but are\r\nseparated by interstices; and it is evident that the smaller the\r\ninterstitial spaces the greater the density. These spaces appear to be\r\nfilled with air in some cases, as may be inferred from certain\r\nsemi-opaque minerals and other substances becoming transparent when\r\nplunged into water. Sometimes they may possibly contain some unknown and\r\nhighly elastic fluid, such as Sir David Brewster has discovered in the\r\nminute cavities of various minerals, which occasionally causes them to\r\nexplode under the hands of the lapidary; but as it is inconceivable that\r\nthe particles of matter should act upon one another without some means\r\nof communication, it is presumed that the interstices of material\r\nsubstances contain a portion of the ethereal medium with which the\r\nregions of space are filled.\r\n\r\nThe various hypotheses that have been formed as to the nature and action\r\nof the forces which unite the particles of matter, have been\r\nsuccessively given up as science advanced, and now nothing decisive has\r\nbeen attained, although Professor Mossotti, of Pisa, by a very able\r\nanalysis, has endeavoured to prove the identity of the cohesive force\r\nwith gravitation. As the particles of material bodies are not in actual\r\ncontact, he supposes that each is surrounded by an atmosphere of the\r\nethereal medium, which he conceives to be electricity; moreover he\r\nassumes that the atoms of the medium repel one another, that the\r\nparticles of matter also repel one another, but with less intensity, and\r\nthat there is a mutual attraction between the particles of matter and\r\nthe atoms of the medium, forces which are assumed to vary inversely as\r\nthe square of the distance.\r\n\r\nHence, when the material molecules of a body are inappreciably near to\r\none another, they mutually repel each other with a force which\r\ndiminishes rapidly as the infinitely small distance between the material\r\nmolecules augments, and at last vanishes. When the molecules are still\r\nfarther apart, the force becomes attractive. At that particular point\r\nwhere the change takes place the forces of repulsion and attraction\r\nbalance each other, so that the molecules of a body are neither disposed\r\nto approach nor recede, but remain in equilibrio. If we try to press\r\nthem nearer, the repulsive force resists the attempt; and if we\r\nendeavour to break the body so as to tear the particles asunder, the\r\nattractive force predominates and keeps them together. This is what\r\nconstitutes the cohesive force, or force of aggregation, by which the\r\nmolecules of all substances are united. The limits of the distance at\r\nwhich the negative action becomes positive vary according to the\r\ntemperature and nature of the molecules, and determine whether the body\r\nwhich they form be solid, liquid, or aëriform.\r\n\r\nBeyond this neutral point the attractive force increases as the distance\r\nbetween the molecules augments till it attains a maximum; when the\r\nparticles are more apart, it diminishes; and, as soon as they are\r\nseparated by finite or sensible distances, it varies directly as their\r\nmass and inversely as the square of the distance, which is precisely the\r\nlaw of universal gravitation.\r\n\r\nThus, on the hypothesis that the mutual repulsion between the electric\r\natoms is a little more powerful than the mutual repulsion between the\r\nparticles of matter, the ether and the matter attract each other with\r\nunequal intensities, which leaves an excess of attractive force\r\nconstituting gravitation. As the gravitating force is in operation\r\nwherever there is matter, the ethereal electric medium must encompass\r\nall the bodies in the universe; and, as it is utterly incomprehensible\r\nthat the celestial bodies should exert a reciprocal attraction through a\r\nvoid, the Professor concludes that the ethereal electrical medium fills\r\nall space.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this connexion between the molecular forces and\r\ngravitation depends upon hypothesis; but in the greater number of\r\nphysical investigations some hypothesis is requisite in the first\r\ninstance to aid the imperfection of our senses; and when the phenomena\r\nof nature accord with the assumption, we are justified in believing it\r\nto be a general law.\r\n\r\nMr. Rankin’s theory of molecular vortices, or the molecular structure of\r\nmatter, is independent of electricity. According to his hypothesis, each\r\natom of matter consists of an inappreciably small nucleus, encompassed\r\nby an elastic ethereal atmosphere which is retained in its position by\r\nattractive forces directed towards the molecule, whilst the molecules\r\nattract each other in the direction of straight lines joining their\r\ncentres. The nuclei may either be solid, or a high condensation of the\r\natmospheres which surround each with decreasing density. When the\r\nattraction between the molecules is such that the elasticity of the\r\natmospheres is insensible, the body is a perfect solid, the rigidity of\r\nwhich bears a certain definite proportion to the elasticity of the\r\nvolume. When the atmospheres are less condensed and the attraction of\r\nthe molecules merely produces a cohesive force sufficient to balance the\r\natomic elasticity of the atmosphere, the body is a perfect liquid; and\r\nwhen the attraction of the molecules is very small compared with the\r\nelasticity of their ethereal atmospheres, the body is a perfect gas.\r\nThese atmospheres are supposed to be portions of the ethereal medium\r\nwhich penetrates into the interstices of every substance, and their\r\nelasticity to be due to the heat generated by the centrifugal force or\r\noscillations among their atoms, for motion is the cause of heat, the\r\nforce producing the motions varying simply as the density of the ether.\r\n\r\nIn aëriform fluids, although the particles are more remote from each\r\nother than in liquids and solids, yet the pressure may be so great as to\r\nreduce an aëriform fluid to a liquid, and a liquid to a solid. Dr.\r\nFaraday has reduced some of the gases to a liquid state by very great\r\ncompression; but although atmospheric air is capable of a diminution of\r\nvolume to which we do not know a limit, it has hitherto always retained\r\nits gaseous qualities, and resumes its primitive volume the instant the\r\npressure is removed. Substances are said to be more or less elastic,\r\naccording to the facility with which they regain their bulk or volume\r\nwhen the pressure is removed; thus liquids resist compression on account\r\nof their elasticity, and in solids the resistance is much greater but\r\nvariable, and the effort required to break a substance is a measure of\r\nthe cohesive force exerted by its particles. In stone, iron, steel, and\r\nall brittle and hard substances, the cohesion of the particles is\r\npowerful but of small extent; in elastic bodies, on the contrary, its\r\naction is weak, but more extensive. An infinite variety of conditions\r\nmay be observed in the fusion of metals and other substances passing\r\nfrom hardness to toughness, viscidity, and through all the other stages\r\nto perfect fluidity and even to vapour. Since all bodies expand by heat,\r\nthe cohesive force is weakened by increase of temperature. The cohesion\r\nof matter or the strength of substances forms an important branch of\r\nstudy in engineering.\r\n\r\nEvery particle of matter, whether it forms a constituent part of a\r\nsolid, liquid, or aëriform fluid, is subject to the law of gravitation.\r\nThe weight of the atmosphere, of gases and vapour, shows that they\r\nconsist of gravitating particles. In liquids the cohesive force is not\r\nsufficiently powerful to resist the action of gravitation. Therefore,\r\nalthough their component particles still maintain their connexion, the\r\nliquid is scattered by their weight, unless when it is confined in a\r\nvessel or has already descended to the lowest point possible, and\r\nassumed a level surface from the mobility of its particles and the\r\ninfluence of the gravitating forces, as in the ocean, or a lake. Solids\r\nwould also fall to pieces by the weight of their particles, if the force\r\nof cohesion were not powerful enough to resist the efforts of\r\ngravitation.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena arising from the force of cohesion are innumerable. The\r\nspherical form of rain-drops; the difficulty of detaching a plate of\r\nglass from the surface of water; the force with which two plane surfaces\r\nadhere when pressed together; the drops that cling to the window-glass\r\nin a shower of rain—are all effects of cohesion entirely independent of\r\natmospheric pressure, and are included in the same analytical formula\r\n(N. 162) which expresses all the circumstances accurately, although the\r\nlaws according to which the forces of cohesion and repulsion vary are\r\nunknown. It is more than probable that the spherical form of the sun and\r\nplanets is due to the force of cohesion, as they have every appearance\r\nof having been at one period in a state of fusion.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable instance has occasionally been observed in plate-glass\r\nmanufactories. After the large plates of glass of which mirrors are to\r\nbe made have received their last polish, they are carefully wiped and\r\nlaid on their edges with their surfaces resting on one another. In the\r\ncourse of time the cohesion has sometimes been so powerful, that they\r\ncould not be separated without breaking. Instances have occurred where\r\ntwo or three have been so perfectly united, that they have been cut and\r\ntheir edges polished as if they had been fused together; and so great\r\nwas the force required to make the surfaces slide that one tore off a\r\nportion of the surface of the other.\r\n\r\nIn liquids and gases the forms of the particles have no influence, they\r\nare so far apart; but the structure of solids varies according to the\r\nsides which the particles present to one another during their\r\naggregation. Nothing is known of their form further than the\r\ndissimilarity of their different sides in certain cases, which appears\r\nfrom their reciprocal attractions during crystallisation being more or\r\nless powerful according to the sides they present to one another.\r\nCrystallisation is an effect of molecular attraction regulated by\r\ncertain laws, according to which atoms of the same kind of matter unite\r\nin regular forms—a fact easily proved by dissolving a piece of alum in\r\npure water. The mutual attraction of the particles is destroyed by the\r\nwater; but, if it be evaporated, they unite, and form in uniting\r\neight-sided figures called octahedrons (N. 163). These however are not\r\nall the same. Some have their angles cut off, others their edges, and\r\nsome both, while the remainder take the regular form. It is quite clear\r\nthat the same circumstances which cause the aggregation of a few\r\nparticles would, if continued, cause the addition of more; and the\r\nprocess would go on as long as any particles remain free round the\r\nprimitive nucleus, which would increase in size, but would remain\r\nunchanged in form, the figure of the particles being such as to maintain\r\nthe regularity and smoothness of the surfaces of the solid and their\r\nmutual inclinations. A broken crystal will by degrees resume its regular\r\nfigure when put back again into the solution of alum, which shows that\r\nthe internal and external particles are similar, and have a similar\r\nattraction for the particles held in solution. The original conditions\r\nof aggregation which make the molecules of the same substance unite in\r\ndifferent forms must be very numerous, since of carbonate of lime alone\r\nthere are many hundred varieties; and certain it is, from the motion of\r\npolarised light through rock crystal, that a very different arrangement\r\nof particles is requisite to produce an extremely small change in\r\nexternal form. A variety of substances in crystallising combine\r\nchemically with a certain portion of water which in a dry state forms an\r\nessential part of their crystals, and, according to the experiments of\r\nMM. Haidinger and Mitscherlich, seems in some cases to give the peculiar\r\ndetermination to their constituent molecules. These gentlemen have\r\nobserved that the same substance crystallising at different temperatures\r\nunites with different quantities of water and assumes a corresponding\r\nvariety of forms. Seleniate of zinc, for example, unites with three\r\ndifferent portions of water, and assumes three different forms,\r\naccording as its temperature in the act of crystallising is hot,\r\nlukewarm, or cold. Sulphate of soda also, which crystallises at 90° of\r\nFahrenheit without water of crystallisation, combines with water at the\r\nordinary temperature, and takes a different form. Heat appears to have a\r\ngreat influence on the phenomena of crystallisation, not only when the\r\nparticles of matter are free, but even when firmly united, for it\r\ndissolves their union, and gives them another determination. Professor\r\nMitscherlich found that prismatic crystals of sulphate of nickel\r\n(N. 164), exposed to a summer’s sun in a close vessel, had their\r\ninternal structure so completely altered without any exterior change,\r\nthat when broken open they were composed internally of octahedrons with\r\nsquare bases. The original aggregation of the internal particles had\r\nbeen dissolved, and a disposition given to arrange themselves in a\r\ncrystalline form. Crystals of sulphate of magnesia and of sulphate of\r\nzinc, gradually heated in alcohol till it boils, lose their transparency\r\nby degrees, and when opened are found to consist of innumerable minute\r\ncrystals totally different in form from the whole crystals; and\r\nprismatic crystals of zinc (N. 165) are changed in a few seconds into\r\noctahedrons by the heat of the sun: other instances might be given of\r\nthe influence of even moderate degrees of temperature on molecular\r\nattraction in the interior of substances. It must be observed that these\r\nexperiments give entirely new views with regard to the constitution of\r\nsolid bodies. We are led from the mobility of fluids to expect great\r\nchanges in the relative positions of their molecules, which must be in\r\nperpetual motion even in the stillest water or calmest air; but we were\r\nnot prepared to find motion to such an extent in the interior of solids.\r\nThat their particles are brought nearer by cold and pressure, or removed\r\nfarther from one another by heat, might be expected; but it could not\r\nhave been anticipated that their relative positions could be so entirely\r\nchanged as to alter their mode of aggregation. It follows, from the low\r\ntemperature at which these changes are effected, that there is probably\r\nno portion of inorganic matter that is not in a state of relative\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mitscherlich’s discoveries with regard to the forms of\r\ncrystallised substances, as connected with their chemical character,\r\nhave thrown additional light on the constitution of material bodies.\r\nThere is a certain set of crystalline forms which are not susceptible of\r\nvariation, as the die or cube (N. 166), which may be small or large, but\r\nis invariably a solid bounded by six square surfaces or planes. Such\r\nalso is the tetrahedron (N. 167) or four-sided solid contained by four\r\nequal-sided triangles. Several other solids belong to this class, which\r\nis called the Tessular system of crystallisation. There are other\r\ncrystals which, though bounded by the same number of sides, and having\r\nthe same form, are yet susceptible of variation; for instance, the\r\neight-sided figure with a square base, called an octahedron (N. 168),\r\nwhich is sometimes flat and low, and sometimes acute and high. It was\r\nformerly believed that identity of form in all crystals not belonging to\r\nthe Tessular system indicated identity of chemical composition.\r\nProfessor Mitscherlich, however, has shown that substances differing to\r\na certain degree in chemical composition have the property of assuming\r\nthe same crystalline form. For example, the neutral phosphate of soda\r\nand the arseniate of soda crystallise in the very same form, contain the\r\nsame quantities of acid, alkali, and water of crystallisation; yet they\r\ndiffer so far, that one contains arsenic and the other an equivalent\r\nquantity of phosphorus. Substances having such properties are said to be\r\nisomorphous, that is, equal in form. Of these there are many groups,\r\neach group having the same form, and similarity though not identity of\r\nchemical composition. For instance, one of the isomorphous groups is\r\nthat consisting of certain chemical substances called the protoxides of\r\niron, copper, zinc, nickel, and manganese, all of which are identical in\r\nform and contain the same quantity of oxygen, but differ in the\r\nrespective metals they contain, which are, however, nearly in the same\r\nproportion in each. All these circumstances tend to prove that\r\nsubstances having the same crystalline form must consist of ultimate\r\natoms having the same figure and arranged in the very same order; so\r\nthat the form of crystals is dependent on their atomic constitution.\r\n\r\nAll crystallised bodies have joints called cleavages, at which they\r\nsplit more easily than in other directions; on this property the whole\r\nart of cutting diamonds depends. Each substance splits in a manner and\r\nin forms peculiar to itself. For example, all the hundreds of forms of\r\ncarbonate of lime split into six-sided figures, called rhombohedrons\r\n(N. 169), whose alternate angles measure 105·55° and 75·05°, however far\r\nthe division may be carried; therefore the ultimate particle of\r\ncarbonate of lime is presumed to have that form. However this may be, it\r\nis certain that all the various crystals of that mineral may be formed\r\nby building up six-sided solids of the form described, in the same\r\nmanner as children build houses with miniature bricks. It may be\r\nimagined that a wide difference may exist between the particles of an\r\nunformed mass and a crystal of the same substance—between the common\r\nshapeless limestone and the pure and limpid crystal of Iceland spar; yet\r\nchemical analysis detects none; their ultimate atoms are identical, and\r\ncrystallisation shows that the difference arises only from the mode of\r\naggregation. Besides, all substances either crystallise naturally, or\r\nmay be made to do so by art. Liquids crystallise in freezing, vapours by\r\nsublimation (N. 170); and hard bodies, when fused, crystallise in\r\ncooling. Hence it may be inferred that all substances are composed of\r\natoms, on whose magnitude, density, and form, their nature and qualities\r\ndepend; and, as these qualities are unchangeable, the ultimate particles\r\nof matter must be incapable of wear—the same now as when created.\r\n\r\nThe size of the ultimate particles of matter must be small in the\r\nextreme. Organised beings, possessing life and all its functions, have\r\nbeen discovered so small, that a million of them would occupy less space\r\nthan a grain of sand. The malleability of gold, the perfume of musk, the\r\nodour of flowers, and many other instances might be given of the\r\nexcessive minuteness of the atoms of matter. Supposing the density of\r\nthe air at the surface of the earth to be represented by unity, Sir John\r\nHerschel has shown that, under any hypothesis as to its atoms, it would\r\nrequire a fraction having at least 1370 figures in its denominator to\r\nexpress its tenuity in the interplanetary space; yet the definite\r\nproportions of chemical compounds afford a proof that divisibility of\r\nmatter has a limit. The cohesive force, which has been the subject of\r\nthe preceding considerations, only unites particles of the same kind of\r\nmatter; whereas affinity, which is the cause of chemical compounds, is\r\nthe mutual attraction between particles of different kinds of matter,\r\ngenerally producing a compound which has no sensible property in common\r\nwith its component parts except that of their combined gravity, as, for\r\nexample, water, which is a compound of oxygen and hydrogen gases. It is\r\nmerely a result of the electrical state of the particles, chemical\r\naffinity and electricity being only forms of the same power. In most\r\ncases it produces electricity, as in the oxidation of metals and\r\ncombustion, and in every case without exception heat is evolved by\r\nbodies while combining chemically; and as heat is an expansive force,\r\nchemical action is changed into mechanical expansion, but it is not\r\nknown in this case why heat is produced, nor the manner in which the\r\nparticles act.\r\n\r\nIt is a permanent and universal law in vast numbers of unorganised\r\nbodies that their composition is definite and invariable, the same\r\ncompound always consisting of the same elements united together in the\r\nsame proportions. Two substances may indeed be mixed; but they will not\r\ncombine to form a third substance different from both, unless their\r\ncomponent particles unite in definite proportions; that is to say, one\r\npart by weight of one of the substances will unite with one part by\r\nweight of the other, or with two parts, or three, or four, &c., so as to\r\nform a new substance; but in any other proportions they will only be\r\nmechanically mixed. For example, one part by weight of hydrogen gas will\r\ncombine with eight parts by weight of oxygen gas, and form water; or it\r\nwill unite with sixteen parts by weight of oxygen, and form a substance\r\ncalled deutoxide of hydrogen; but, added to any other weight of oxygen,\r\nit will produce one or both of these compounds mingled with the portion\r\nof oxygen or hydrogen in excess. The law of definite proportion\r\nestablished by Dr. Dalton, on the principle that every compound body\r\nconsists of a combination of the atoms of its constituent parts, is of\r\nuniversal application, and is in fact one of the most important\r\ndiscoveries in physical science, furnishing information previously\r\nunhoped for with regard to the most secret and minute operations of\r\nnature, in disclosing the relative weights of the ultimate atoms of\r\nmatter. Thus an atom of oxygen uniting with an atom of hydrogen forms\r\nthe compound water; but, as every drop of water however small consists\r\nof eight parts by weight of oxygen and one part by weight of hydrogen,\r\nit follows that an atom of oxygen is eight times heavier than an atom of\r\nhydrogen. In the same manner sulphuretted hydrogen gas consists of\r\nsixteen parts by weight of sulphur and one of hydrogen; therefore an\r\natom of sulphur is sixteen times heavier than an atom of hydrogen. Also\r\ncarbonic oxide is constituted of six parts by weight of carbon and eight\r\nof oxygen; and, as an atom of oxygen has eight times the weight of an\r\natom of hydrogen, it follows that an atom of carbon is six times heavier\r\nthan one of hydrogen. Since the same definite proportion holds in the\r\ncomposition of a vast number of substances that have been examined, it\r\nhas been concluded that there are great differences in the weights of\r\nthe ultimate particles of matter. Although Dalton’s law is fully\r\nestablished, yet instances have occurred from which it appears that the\r\natomic theory deduced from it is not always maintained. M. Gay Lussac\r\ndiscovered that gases unite together by their bulk or volumes, in such\r\nsimple and definite proportions as one to one, one to two, one to three,\r\n&c. For example, one volume or measure of oxygen unites with two volumes\r\nor measures of hydrogen in the formation of water.\r\n\r\nDr. Faraday has proved, by experiments on bodies both in solution and\r\nfusion, that chemical affinity is merely a result of the electrical\r\nstate of the particles of matter. Now it must be observed that the\r\ncomposition of bodies, as well as their decomposition, may be\r\naccomplished by means of electricity; and Dr. Faraday has found that\r\nthis chemical composition and decomposition, by a given current of\r\nelectricity, is always accomplished according to the laws of definite\r\nproportions; and that the quantity of electricity requisite for the\r\ndecomposition of a substance is exactly the quantity necessary for its\r\ncomposition. Thus the quantity of electricity which can decompose a\r\ngrain weight of water is exactly equal to the quantity of electricity\r\nwhich unites the elements of that grain of water together, and is\r\nequivalent to the quantity of atmospheric electricity which is active in\r\na very powerful flash of lightning. This law is universal, and of that\r\nhigh and general order which characterises all great discoveries.\r\nChemical force is extremely powerful. A pound of the best coal gives\r\nwhen burnt sufficient heat to raise the temperature of 8086 pounds of\r\nwater one Centigrade degree, whence Professor Helmholtz of Bonn has\r\ncomputed that the magnitude of the chemical force of attraction between\r\nthe particles of a pound of coal and the quantity of oxygen that\r\ncorresponds to it, is capable of lifting a weight of 100 pounds to the\r\nheight of 20 miles.\r\n\r\nDr. Faraday has given a singular instance of cohesive force inducing\r\nchemical combination, by the following experiment, which seems to be\r\nnearly allied to the discovery made by M. Dœbereiner, in 1823, of the\r\nspontaneous combustion of spongy platinum (N. 171) exposed to a stream\r\nof hydrogen gas mixed with common air. A plate of platinum with\r\nextremely clean surfaces, when plunged into oxygen and hydrogen gas\r\nmixed in the proportions which are found in the constitution of water,\r\ncauses the gases to combine and water to be formed, the platinum to\r\nbecome red-hot, and at last an explosion to take place; the only\r\nconditions necessary for this curious experiment being excessive purity\r\nin the gases and in the surface of the plate. A sufficiently pure\r\nmetallic surface can only be obtained by immersing the platinum in very\r\nstrong hot sulphuric acid and then washing it in distilled water, or by\r\nmaking it the positive pole of a galvanic pile in dilute sulphuric acid.\r\nIt appears that the force of cohesion, as well as the force of affinity,\r\nexerted by particles of matter, extends to all the particles within a\r\nvery minute distance. Hence the platinum, while drawing the particles of\r\nthe two gases towards its surface by its great cohesive attraction,\r\nbrings them so near to one another that they come within the sphere of\r\ntheir mutual affinity, and a chemical combination takes place. Dr.\r\nFaraday attributes the effect in part also to a diminution in the\r\nelasticity of the gaseous particles on their sides adjacent to the\r\nplatinum, and to their perfect mixture or association, as well as to the\r\npositive action of the metal in condensing them against its surface by\r\nits attractive force. The particles when chemically united run off the\r\nsurface of the metal in the form of water by their gravitation, or pass\r\naway as aqueous vapour and make way for others.\r\n\r\nThe oscillations of the atmosphere, and the changes in its temperature,\r\nare measured by variations in the heights of the barometer and\r\nthermometer. But the actual length of the liquid columns depends not\r\nonly upon the force of gravitation, but upon the cohesive force or\r\nreciprocal attraction between the molecules of the liquid and those of\r\nthe tube containing it. This peculiar action of the cohesive force is\r\ncalled capillary attraction or capillarity. If a glass tube of extremely\r\nfine bore, such as a small thermometer tube, be plunged into a cup of\r\nwater or spirit of wine, the liquid will immediately rise in the tube\r\nabove the level of that in the cup; and the surface of the little column\r\nthus suspended will be a hollow hemisphere, whose diameter is the\r\ninterior diameter of the tube. If the same tube be plunged into a cupful\r\nof mercury, the liquid will also rise in the tube, but it will never\r\nattain the level of that in the cup, and its surface will be a\r\nhemisphere whose diameter is also the diameter of the tube (N. 172). The\r\nelevation or depression of the same liquid in different tubes of the\r\nsame matter is in the inverse ratio of their internal diameters\r\n(N. 173), and altogether independent of their thickness; whence it\r\nfollows that the molecular action is insensible at sensible distances,\r\nand that it is only the thinnest possible film of the interior surface\r\nof the tubes that exerts a sensible action on the liquid. So much indeed\r\nis this the case, that, when tubes of the same bore are completely\r\nwetted with water throughout their whole extent, mercury will rise to\r\nthe same height in all of them, whatever be their thickness or density,\r\nbecause the minute coating of moisture is sufficient to remove the\r\ninternal column of mercury beyond the sphere of attraction of the tube,\r\nand to supply the place of a tube by its own capillary attraction. The\r\nforces which produce the capillary phenomena are the reciprocal\r\nattraction of the tube and the liquid, and of the liquid particles on\r\none another; and, in order that the capillary column may be in\r\nequilibrio, the weight of that part of it which rises above or sinks\r\nbelow the level of the liquid in the cup must balance these forces.\r\n\r\nThe estimation of the action of the liquid is a difficult part of this\r\nproblem. La Place, Dr. Young, and other mathematicians, have considered\r\nthe liquid within the tube to be of uniform density; but M. Poisson, in\r\none of those masterly productions in which he elucidates the most\r\nabstruse subjects, has proved that the phenomena of capillary attraction\r\ndepend upon a rapid decrease in the density of the liquid column\r\nthroughout an extremely small space at its surface. Every indefinitely\r\nthin layer of a liquid is compressed by the liquid above it, and\r\nsupported by that below. Its degree of condensation depends upon the\r\nmagnitude of the compressive force; and, as this force decreases rapidly\r\ntowards the surface, where it vanishes the density of the liquid\r\ndecreases also. M. Poisson has shown that, when this force is omitted,\r\nthe capillary surface becomes plane, and that the liquid in the tube\r\nwill neither rise above nor sink below the level of that in the cup. In\r\nestimating the forces, it is also necessary to include the variation in\r\nthe density of the capillary surface round the edges from the attraction\r\nof the tube.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the resulting force determines the curvature of the\r\nsurface of the capillary column. In order that a liquid may be in\r\nequilibrio, the force resulting from all the forces acting upon it must\r\nbe perpendicular to the surface. Now it appears that, as glass is more\r\ndense than water or alcohol, the resulting force will be inclined\r\ntowards the interior side of the tube; therefore the surface of the\r\nliquid must be more elevated at the sides of the tube than in the centre\r\nin order to be perpendicular to it, so that it will be concave as in the\r\nthermometer. But, as glass is less dense than mercury, the resulting\r\nforce will be inclined from the interior side of the tube (N. 174), so\r\nthat the surface of the capillary column must be more depressed at the\r\nsides of the tube than in the centre, in order to be perpendicular to\r\nthe resulting force, and is consequently convex, as may be perceived in\r\nthe mercury of the barometer when rising. The absorption of moisture by\r\nsponges, sugar, salt, &c., are familiar examples of capillary\r\nattraction. Indeed the pores of sugar are so minute, that there seems to\r\nbe no limit to the ascent of the liquid. Wine is drawn up in a curve on\r\nthe interior surface of a glass; tea rises above its level on the side\r\nof a cup; but, if the glass or cup be too full, the edges attract the\r\nliquid downwards, and give it a rounded form. A column of liquid will\r\nrise above or sink below its level between two plane parallel surfaces\r\nwhen near to one another, according to the relative densities of the\r\nplates and the liquid (N. 175); and the phenomena will be exactly the\r\nsame as in a cylindrical tube whose diameter is double the distance of\r\nthe plates from each other. If the two surfaces be very near to one\r\nanother, and touch each other at one of their upright edges, the liquid\r\nwill rise highest at the edges that are in contact, and will gradually\r\ndiminish in height as the surfaces become more separated. The whole\r\noutline of the liquid column will have the form of a hyperbola. Indeed,\r\nso universal is the action of capillarity, that solids and liquids\r\ncannot touch one another without producing a change in the form of the\r\nsurface of the liquid.\r\n\r\nThe attractions and repulsions arising from capillarity present many\r\ncurious phenomena. If two plates of glass or metal, both of which are\r\neither dry or wet, be partly immersed in a liquid parallel to one\r\nanother, the liquid will be raised or depressed close to their surfaces,\r\nbut will maintain its level through the rest of the space that separates\r\nthem. At such a distance they neither attract nor repel one another; but\r\nthe instant they are brought so near as to make the level part of the\r\nliquid disappear, and the two curved parts of it meet, the two plates\r\nwill rush towards each other and remain pressed together (N. 176). If\r\none of the surfaces be wet and the other dry, they will repel one\r\nanother when so near as to have a curved surface of liquid between them;\r\nbut, if forced to approach a little nearer, the repulsion will be\r\novercome, and they will attract each other as if they were both wet or\r\nboth dry. Two balls of pith or wood floating in water, or two balls of\r\ntin floating in mercury, attract one another as soon as they are so near\r\nthat the surface of the liquid is curved between them. Two ships in the\r\nocean may be brought into collision by this principle. But two balls,\r\none of which is wet and the other dry, repel one another as soon as the\r\nliquid which separates them is curved at its surface. A bit of tea-leaf\r\nis attracted by the edge of the cup if wet, and repelled when dry,\r\nprovided it be not too far from the edge and the cup moderately full; if\r\ntoo full, the contrary takes place. It is probable that the rise of the\r\nsap in vegetables is in some degree owing to capillarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION XV.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the Atmosphere—Its Pressure—Law of Decrease in\r\n  Density—Law of Decrease in Temperature—Measurement of Heights\r\n  by the Barometer—Extent of the Atmosphere—Barometrical\r\n  Variations—Oscillations—Trade-Winds—Cloud-Ring—Monsoons—Rotation of\r\n  Winds—Laws of Hurricanes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE atmosphere is not homogeneous. It appears from analysis that, of 100\r\nparts, 99·5 consist of nitrogen and oxygen gases mixed in the\r\nproportions of 79 to 21 of volume, the remainder consists of 0·05 parts\r\nof carbonic acid and on an average 0·45 of aqueous vapour. These\r\nproportions are found to be the same at all heights hitherto attained by\r\nman. The air is an elastic fluid, resisting pressure in every direction,\r\nand is subject to the law of gravitation. As the space in the top of the\r\ntube of a barometer is a vacuum, the column of mercury suspended by the\r\npressure of the atmosphere on the surface of that in the cistern is a\r\nmeasure of its weight. Consequently every variation in the density\r\noccasions a corresponding rise or fall in the barometrical column. At\r\nthe level of the sea in latitude 42°, and at the temperature of melting\r\nice, the mean height of the barometer is 29·922 or 30 inches nearly. The\r\npressure of the atmosphere is about fifteen pounds on every square inch;\r\nso that the surface of the whole globe sustains a weight of\r\n11,671,000,000 hundreds of millions of pounds. Shell-fish, which have\r\nthe power of producing a vacuum, adhere to the rocks by a pressure of\r\nfifteen pounds upon every square inch of contact.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere when in equilibrio is an ellipsoid flattened at the poles\r\nfrom its rotation with the earth. In that state its strata are of\r\nuniform density at equal heights above the level of the sea; but since\r\nthe air is both heavy and elastic, its density necessarily diminishes in\r\nascending above the surface of the earth; for each stratum of air is\r\ncompressed only by the weight above it. Therefore the upper strata are\r\nless dense because they are less compressed than those below them.\r\nWhence it is easy to show, supposing the temperature to be constant,\r\nthat if the heights above the earth be taken in increasing arithmetical\r\nprogression, that is, if they increase by equal quantities, as by a foot\r\nor a mile, the densities of the strata of air, or the heights of the\r\nbarometer which are proportionate to them, will decrease in geometrical\r\nprogression. For example, at the level of the sea if the mean height of\r\nthe barometer be 29·922 inches, at the height of 18,000 feet it will be\r\n14·961 inches, or one half as great; at the height of 36,000 feet it\r\nwill be one-fourth as great; at 54,000 feet it will be one-eighth, and\r\nso on. Sir John Herschel has shown that the actual decrease is much more\r\nrapid, and that, in any hypothesis that has been formed with regard to\r\nthe divisibility of the aërial atoms, a vacuum exists at the height of\r\n80 or 90 miles above the earth’s surface, inconceivably more perfect\r\nthan any that can be produced in the best air-pumps. Indeed the decrease\r\nin density is so rapid that three-fourths of all the air contained in\r\nthe atmosphere is within four miles of the earth; and, as its\r\nsuperficial extent is 200 millions of square miles, its relative\r\nthickness is less than that of a sheet of paper when compared with its\r\nbreadth. The air even on mountain tops is sufficiently rare to diminish\r\nthe intensity of sound, to affect respiration, and to occasion a loss of\r\nmuscular strength. The blood burst from the lips and ears of M. de\r\nHumboldt as he ascended the Andes; and he experienced the same\r\ndifficulty in kindling and maintaining a fire at great heights which\r\nMarco Polo, the Venetian, felt on the mountains of Central Asia. M.\r\nGay-Lussac ascended in a balloon to the height of 4·36 miles, and he\r\nsuffered greatly from the rarity of the air. It is true that at the\r\nheight of thirty-seven miles the atmosphere is still dense enough to\r\nreflect the rays of the sun when 18° below the horizon; but the tails of\r\ncomets show that extremely attenuated matter is capable of reflecting\r\nlight. And although, at the height of fifty miles, the bursting of the\r\nmeteor of 1783 was heard on earth like the report of a cannon, it only\r\nproves the immensity of the explosion of a mass half a mile in diameter,\r\nwhich could produce a sound capable of penetrating air three thousand\r\ntimes more rare than that we breathe. But even these heights are\r\nextremely small when compared with the radius of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe density of the air is modified by various circumstances, chiefly by\r\nchanges of temperature, because heat dilates the air and cold contracts\r\nit, varying 1/480 of the whole bulk when at 32° for every degree of\r\nFahrenheit’s thermometer. Experience shows that the heat of the air\r\ndecreases as the height above the surface of the earth increases. It\r\nappears that the mean temperature of space is 226° below the zero point\r\nof Fahrenheit by the theories of Fourier and Pouillet, but Sir John\r\nHerschel has computed it to be -239° Fahr. from observations made during\r\nthe ascent in balloons. Such would probably be the temperature of the\r\nsurface of the earth also, were it not for the non-conducting power of\r\nthe air, whence it is enabled to retain the heat of the sun’s rays,\r\nwhich the earth imbibes and radiates in all directions. The decrease in\r\nheat is very irregular; each authority gives a different estimate,\r\nbecause it varies with latitude and local circumstances, but from the\r\nmean of five different statements it seems to be about one degree for\r\nevery 334 feet; the mean of observations made in balloons is 400 feet,\r\nwhich is probably nearer the truth. This is the cause of the severe cold\r\nand perpetual snow on the summits of the alpine chains. In the year 1852\r\nfour ascents in a balloon took place from the meteorological observatory\r\nat Kew, in which the greatest height attained was 22,370 feet. The\r\nobservations then made by Mr. Welsh furnished Sir John Herschel with\r\ndata for computing that the temperature of space is minus 239°, that is\r\n239° below the zero point of Fahrenheit, that the limiting temperature\r\nof the atmosphere is probably 77-1/2 degrees below that point at the\r\nequator, and 119-1/2 below it at the poles, with a range of temperature\r\nfrom the surface of 161-1/2° in the former case, and 119-1/2° in the\r\nlatter. During these ascents it was found that the temperature of the\r\nair decreases uniformly up to a certain point, where it is arrested and\r\nremains constant, or increases through a depth of 2000 or 3000 feet,\r\nafter which it decreases again according to the same law as before.\r\nThroughout this zone of constant temperature it either rains, or there\r\nis a great fall in the dew point; in short, it is the region of clouds,\r\nand the increase of temperature is owing to the latent or absorbed heat\r\nset free by the condensation of the aqueous vapour. In the latitude of\r\nKew the cloud region begins at altitudes varying between 2000 and 6500\r\nfeet, according to the state of the weather.\r\n\r\nWere it not for the effects of temperature on the density of the air,\r\nthe heights of mountains might be determined by the barometer alone; but\r\nas the thermometer must also be consulted, the determination becomes\r\nmore complicated. Mr. Ivory’s method of computing heights from\r\nbarometrical measurements has the advantage of combining accuracy with\r\nthe greatest simplicity. Indeed the accuracy with which the heights of\r\nmountains can be obtained by this method is very remarkable. Admiral\r\nSmyth, R.N., and Sir John Herschel measured the height of Etna by the\r\nbarometer, without any communication and in different years; Admiral\r\nSmyth made it 10,874 feet, and Sir John Herschel 10,873, the difference\r\nbeing only one foot. In consequence of the diminished pressure of the\r\natmosphere water boils at a lower temperature on mountain tops than in\r\nthe valleys, which induced Fahrenheit to propose this mode of\r\nobservation as a method of ascertaining their heights. It is very\r\nsimple, as Professor Forbes ascertained that the temperature of the\r\nboiling point varies in arithmetical proportion with the height, or 5495\r\nfeet for every degree of Fahrenheit, so that the calculation of height\r\nbecomes one of arithmetic only, without the use of any table.\r\n\r\nThe mean pressure of the atmosphere is not the same all over the globe.\r\nIt is less by 0·24 of an inch at the equator than at the tropics or in\r\nthe higher latitudes, in consequence of the ascent of heated air and\r\nvapour from the surface of the ocean. It is less also on the shores of\r\nthe Baltic Sea than it is in France, and it was observed by Sir James C.\r\nRoss that throughout the whole of the Antarctic Ocean, from 68° to 74°\r\nS. latitude, and from 8° to 7° W. longitude, there is a depression of\r\nthe barometer amounting to an inch and upwards, which is equivalent to\r\nan elevation above the sea level of 800 feet. A similar depression was\r\nobserved by M. Erman in the sea of Ochotzk, and in the adjacent\r\ncontinent of eastern Siberia. Sir John Herschel assigns as the cause of\r\nthese singular anomalies the great system of circulation of the trade\r\nand antetrade winds, in both hemispheres, reacting upon the general mass\r\nof the continents as obstacles in their path, which is modified by the\r\nconfiguration of the land.\r\n\r\nThere are various periodic oscillations in the atmosphere, which, rising\r\nand falling like waves in the sea, occasion corresponding changes in the\r\nheight of the barometer, but they differ as much from the trade-winds,\r\nmonsoons, and other currents, as the tides of the sea do from the\r\nGulf-stream and other oceanic rivers. The sun and moon disturb the\r\nequilibrium of the atmosphere by their attraction, and produce annual\r\nundulations which have their maximum altitudes at the equinoxes, and\r\ntheir minima at the solstices. There are also lunar tides, which ebb and\r\nflow twice in the course of a lunation. The diurnal tides, which\r\naccomplish their rise and fall in six hours, are greatly modified by the\r\nheat of the sun. Between the tropics the barometer attains its maximum\r\nheight about nine in the morning, then sinks till three or four in the\r\nafternoon; it again rises and attains a second maximum about nine in the\r\nevening, and then it begins to fall, and reaches a second minimum at\r\nthree in the morning, again to pursue the same course. According to M.\r\nBouvard, the amount of the oscillations at the equator is proportional\r\nto the temperature, and in other parallels it varies as the temperature\r\nand the square of the cosine of the latitude conjointly; consequently it\r\ndecreases from the equator to the poles, but it is somewhat greater in\r\nthe day than in the night.\r\n\r\nBesides these small undulations, there are vast waves perpetually moving\r\nover the continents and oceans in separate and independent systems,\r\nbeing confined to local, yet very extensive districts, probably\r\noccasioned by long-continued rains or dry weather over large tracts of\r\ncountry. By numerous barometrical observations made simultaneously in\r\nboth hemispheres, the courses of several have been traced, some of which\r\noccupy twenty-four, and others thirty-six, hours to accomplish their\r\nrise and fall. One especially of these vast barometric waves, many\r\nhundreds of miles in breadth, has been traced over the greater part of\r\nEurope; and not its breadth only, but also the direction of its front\r\nand its velocity, have been clearly ascertained. Although, like all\r\nother waves, these are but moving forms, yet winds arise dependent on\r\nthem like tide streams in the ocean. Mr. Birt has determined the periods\r\nof other waves of still greater extent and duration, two of which\r\nrequired seventeen days to rise and fall; and another which takes\r\nfourteen days to complete its undulation, called by Mr. Birt the\r\nNovember wave, passes annually over the British Islands, probably over\r\nthe whole of Europe and the seas on its northern coasts. Its crest,\r\nwhich appears to be 6000 miles in extent, moves from N.W. to S.E. at the\r\nrate of about 19 miles an hour; while the extent of its barometrical\r\nelevation from its trough to its crest is seldom less than an inch,\r\nsometimes double that quantity. The great crest is preceded and followed\r\nat about five days’ interval by two lower ones, and the beginning and\r\nend are marked by deep depressions. The researches of M. Leverrier leave\r\nno doubt that the great Crimean storm of the 14th November, 1854, was\r\npart of this phenomenon,[8] for even a very small difference of\r\natmospheric pressure is sufficient to raise a considerable wind. Since\r\neach oscillation has its perfect effect independently of the others,\r\neach one is marked by a change in the barometer, and this is beautifully\r\nillustrated by curves constructed from a series of observations. The\r\ngeneral form of the curve shows the course of the principal wave, while\r\nsmall undulations in its outline mark the maxima and minima of the minor\r\noscillations.\r\n\r\nThe trade-winds, which are the principal currents in the atmosphere, are\r\nonly a particular case of those very general laws which regulate the\r\nmotion of the winds depending on the rarefaction of the air combined\r\nwith the rotation of the earth on its axis. They are permanent currents\r\nof wind between the tropics, blowing to the N.E. on the N. side of the\r\nequator, and to the S.E. on the S. side.\r\n\r\nIf currents of air come from the poles, it is clear that equilibrium\r\nmust be restored by counter-currents from the equator; moreover, winds\r\ncoming from the poles, where there is no rotation, to the equator, which\r\nrevolves from W. to E. at the rate of 1000 miles an hour, must of\r\nnecessity move in a direction resulting from their own progressive\r\nmotion and that of rotation; hence, in blowing towards the equator the\r\nbias is to the E., and in blowing from it the bias is to the W. Thus as\r\nN. and S. winds from the poles blow along the surface from the tropics\r\nto the equator, in consequence of this composition of motions that from\r\nthe N. becomes the N.E. trade-wind, and that from the S. the S.E.\r\ntrade-wind. Now these winds being in contrary directions cross at the\r\nequator, balance each other through about 6 degrees of latitude, and\r\nproduce a belt of calms of that breadth encircling the globe, known as\r\nthe calms of the equator, or the Variables of seamen. The heat of the\r\nsun rarefies the air so much, that the trade-winds, after crossing at\r\nthe equator, ascend into the higher regions of the atmosphere, where\r\nthat from the N. goes to the tropic of Capricorn, and that from the S.\r\nto the tropic of Cancer. But while travelling in these lofty regions\r\nthey become cold and heavy, and, sinking to the surface at the tropics,\r\neach proceeds to the opposite pole from which it set out. Now, however,\r\nthey have a greater rotatory motion than the places they successively\r\narrive at, so the bias is to the W., and they become the N.W. and S.W.\r\nextra-tropical winds.\r\n\r\nIf on arriving at the poles the air were to accumulate there, the\r\ncirculation of the winds would cease; but currents rise into the upper\r\nregions, and flow back again to the tropics, where they sink down to\r\nfill the vacuum caused by the great precipitation of vapour in these\r\nregions, and then flow to the equator as trade-winds (N. 177). So the\r\ncurrents of air cross again at the tropics and produce two belts of\r\ncalms which surround the globe, named by Lieutenant Maury the Calms of\r\nCancer and the Calms of Capricorn, but generally known to sailors as the\r\nDoldrums. Thus the winds go from pole to pole and back again,\r\nalternately as under and upper currents. In their circuits the winds\r\ncross each other five times, producing regions of calms at the poles,\r\nthe tropics, and equator. The trade-winds generally extend for about 28°\r\non each side of the equator, but, on account of the greater quantity of\r\nland in the northern hemisphere, the N.E. trade-wind is narrower than\r\nthe S.E.\r\n\r\nThe sun is perpetually raising enormous quantities of vapour from the\r\nocean which the trade-winds carry to the equator: it is condensed when\r\nit rises with the air into the higher strata, and forms a ring of clouds\r\nalong the southern side of the belt of equatorial calms that surrounds\r\nthe earth, which, during the day, is perpetually pouring down torrents\r\nof rain, while the sun continually beating upon its upper surface\r\ndissolves the clouds into invisible vapour which is carried by the winds\r\nand condensed into rain on the extra-tropical regions. The whole system\r\nof trade-winds, equatorial and tropical calms, with the cloud ring,\r\nfollow the sun in declination; consequently in its journeys back and\r\nforwards it annually travels over 1000 miles of latitude, and regulates\r\nthe dry and rainy season in the tropical parts of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe monsoons, which are periodic winds in the Indian Ocean, in part\r\ndepend upon this movement. For when the sun is in the northern\r\nhemisphere the trade-winds come northward with him; and when his intense\r\nheat expands the air over the Great Gobi and other arid Asiatic deserts,\r\nit ascends; the N.E. trade-wind is drawn in to fill the vacuum and\r\nascends with it; then the S.E. trade-wind, being no longer met and\r\nbalanced by the N.E. trade, passes into the northern hemisphere, and as\r\nit proceeds northward from the equator it is deflected to the west by\r\nthe rotation of the earth, combined with the indraught over the heated\r\ndeserts, and becomes the S.W. monsoon, which blows while the sun is\r\nnorth of the equator, but as soon as he goes south, and no longer\r\nrarefies the air over the Indian deserts, the S.E. trade-wind resumes\r\nits usual course, and is then known as the S.E. monsoon. The influence\r\nof the heated deserts is perceptible to the distance of 1000 miles from\r\nthe shore; the monsoons prevail with great steadiness over the Arabian\r\nGulf, the Indian Ocean, and part of the China Sea. At the change,\r\ntorrents of rain and violent thunderstorms accompany the conflict\r\nbetween the contending winds.\r\n\r\nThe Sahara desert in North Africa, and those of Utah, Texas, and New\r\nMexico, occasion the monsoons which prevail in the North Atlantic and on\r\nboth sides of Central America, and the monsoons which blow to the north\r\nof Australia show the sterility of the interior, even if other proofs\r\nwere wanting. From the powerful effect of the land in drawing off the\r\nwinds from their course, it may be seen why the N.E. trade-winds are\r\nnarrower than the S.E. trades.\r\n\r\nIn the extra-tropical winds in the North Atlantic, which blow from the\r\n40th parallel to the pole, the north-westerly are to the easterly as 2\r\nto 1: hence there would be an accumulation of air at the pole at the\r\nexpense of the equator, did not a current rise at the pole and return to\r\nthe equator through the high regions of the atmosphere, which confirms\r\nthe theory of the rotation of the wind.\r\n\r\nThere are many proofs of the existence of the counter-currents above the\r\ntrade-winds. On the Peak of Teneriffe the prevailing winds are from the\r\nwest. Light clouds have frequently been seen moving rapidly from west to\r\neast at a very great height above the trade-winds, which were sweeping\r\nalong the surface of the ocean in a contrary direction. Rains, clouds,\r\nand nearly all the other atmospheric phenomena, occur below the height\r\nof 18,000 feet, and generally much nearer to the surface of the earth.\r\nThey are owing to currents of air running upon each other in horizontal\r\nstrata, differing in their electric state, in temperature and moisture,\r\nas well as in velocity and direction.\r\n\r\nWhen north and south winds blow alternately, the wind at any place will\r\nveer in one uniform direction through every point of the compass,\r\nprovided the one begins before the other has ceased. In the northern\r\nhemisphere a north wind sets out with a smaller degree of rotatory\r\nmotion than the places have at which it successively arrives,\r\nconsequently it passes through all the points of the compass from N. to\r\nN.E. and E. A current from the south, on the contrary, sets out with a\r\ngreater rotatory velocity than the places have at which it successively\r\narrives, so by the rotation of the earth it is deflected from S. to S.W.\r\nand W. Now, if the vane at any place should have veered from the N.\r\nthrough N.E. to E., and a south wind should spring up, it would combine\r\nits motion with the former and cause the vane to turn successively from\r\nthe E. to S.E. and S. But by the earth’s rotation this south wind will\r\nveer to the S.W. and W., and, if a north wind should now arise, it would\r\ncombine its motion with that of the west, and cause it to veer to the\r\nN.W. and N. Thus two alternations of north and south wind will cause the\r\nvane at any place to go completely round the compass, from N. to E., S.,\r\nW., and N. again. At the Royal Observatory at Greenwich the wind\r\naccomplishes five circuits in that direction in the course of a year.\r\nWhen circumstances combine to produce alternate north and south winds in\r\nthe southern hemisphere, the gyration is in the contrary direction.\r\nAlthough the general tendency of the wind may be rotatory, and is so in\r\nmany instances, at least for part of the year, yet it is so often\r\ncounteracted by local circumstances, that the winds are in general very\r\nirregular, every disturbance in atmospheric equilibrium from heat or any\r\nother cause producing a corresponding wind. The most prevalent winds in\r\nEurope are the N.E. and S.W.; the former arises from the north polar\r\ncurrent, and the latter from causes already mentioned. The law of the\r\nwind’s rotation was first described by Dr. Dalton, but has been\r\ndeveloped by Professor Dove, of Berlin.\r\n\r\nHurricanes are those storms of wind in which the portion of the\r\natmosphere that forms them revolves in a horizontal circuit round a\r\nvertical or somewhat inclined axis of rotation, while the axis itself,\r\nand consequently the whole storm, is carried forward along the surface\r\nof the globe, so that the direction in which the storm is advancing is\r\nquite different from the direction in which the rotatory current may be\r\nblowing at any point. In the West Indies, where hurricanes are frequent\r\nand destructive, they generally originate in the tropical regions near\r\nthe inner boundary of the trade-winds, and are caused by the vertical\r\nascent of a column of rarefied air, whose place is supplied by a rush of\r\nwind from the surrounding regions, set into gyration by the rotation of\r\nthe earth. By far the greater number of Atlantic hurricanes have begun\r\neastward of the lesser Antilles or Caribbean Islands.\r\n\r\nIn every case the axis of the storm moves in an elliptical or parabolic\r\ncurve, having its vertex in or near the tropic of Cancer, which marks\r\nthe external limit of the trade-winds north of the equator. As the\r\nmotion before it reaches the tropic is in a straight line from S.E. to\r\nN.W., and after it has passed it from S.W. to N.E., the bend of the\r\ncurve is turned towards Florida and the Carolinas. In the southern\r\nhemisphere the body of the storm moves in exactly the opposite\r\ndirection. The hurricanes which originate south of the equator, and\r\nwhose initial path is from N.E. to S.W., bend round at the tropic of\r\nCapricorn, and then move from N.W. to S.E.\r\n\r\nThe extent and velocity of these storms are great; for instance, the\r\nhurricane that took place on the 12th of August, 1830, was traced from\r\neastward of the Caribbee Islands, along the Gulf Stream, to the bank of\r\nNewfoundland, a distance of more than 3000 miles, which it passed over\r\nin six days. Although the hurricane of the 1st of September, 1821, was\r\nnot so extensive, its velocity was greater, as it moved at the rate of\r\n30 miles an hour: small storms are generally more rapid than those of\r\ngreater dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe action of these storms seems to be at first confined to the stratum\r\nof air nearest the earth, and then they seldom appear to be more than a\r\nmile high, though sometimes they are raised higher; or even divided by a\r\nmountain into two separate storms, each of which continues its new path\r\nand gyrations with increased violence. This occurred in the gale of the\r\n25th of December, 1821, in the Mediterranean, when the Spanish mountains\r\nand the Maritime Alps became new centres of motion.\r\n\r\nBy the friction of the earth the axis of the storm bends a little\r\nforward. This causes a continual intermixture of the lower and warmer\r\nstrata of air with those that are higher and colder, producing torrents\r\nof rain and violent electric explosions.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of the whirlwind is greatly augmented when the path of the\r\nstorm changes on crossing the tropic. The vortex of a storm has covered\r\nan extent of the surface of the globe 500 miles in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe revolving motion accounts for the sudden and violent changes\r\nobserved during hurricanes. In consequence of the rotation of the air,\r\nthe wind blows in opposite directions on each side of the axis of the\r\nstorm, and the violence of the blast increases from the circumference\r\ntowards the centre of gyration, but in the centre itself the air is in\r\nrepose: hence, when the body of the storm passes over a place, the wind\r\nbegins to blow moderately, and increases to a hurricane as the centre of\r\nthe whirlwind approaches; then, in a moment, a dead and awful calm\r\nsucceeds, suddenly followed by a renewal of the storm in all its\r\nviolence, but now blowing in a direction diametrically opposite to its\r\nformer course. This happened at the Island of St. Thomas on the 2nd of\r\nAugust, 1837, where the hurricane increased in violence till half-past\r\nseven in the morning, when perfect stillness took place for forty\r\nminutes, after which the storm recommenced in a contrary direction.\r\n\r\nThe sudden fall of the mercury in the barometer in the regions\r\nhabitually visited by hurricanes is a certain indication of a coming\r\ntempest. In consequence of the centrifugal force of these rotatory\r\nstorms the air becomes rarefied, and, as the atmosphere is disturbed to\r\nsome distance beyond the actual circle of gyration or limits of the\r\nstorm, the barometer often sinks some hours before its arrival, from the\r\noriginal cause of the rotatory disturbance. It continues sinking under\r\nthe first half of the hurricane, is at a maximum sometimes of two inches\r\nin the centre of gyration, and again rises during the passage of the\r\nlatter half, though it does not attain its greatest height till the\r\nstorm is over. The diminution of atmospheric pressure is greater and\r\nextends over a wider area in the temperate zones than in the torrid, on\r\naccount of the sudden expansion of the circle of rotation when the gale\r\ncrosses the tropic.\r\n\r\nAs the fall of the barometer gives warning of the approach of a\r\nhurricane, so the laws of the storm’s motion afford the seaman knowledge\r\nto guide him in avoiding it. In the northern temperate zone, if the gale\r\nbegins from the S.E. and veers by S. to W., the ship should steer to the\r\nS.E.; but, if the gale begins from the N.E., and changes through N. to\r\nN.W., the vessel should go to the N.W. In the northern part of the\r\ntorrid zone, if the storm begin from the N.E., and veer through E. to\r\nS.E., the ship should steer to the N.E.; but, if it begin from the N.W.,\r\nand veer by W. to S.W., the ship should steer to the S.W., because she\r\nis in the south-western side of the storm. Since the laws of storms are\r\nreversed in the southern hemisphere, the rules for steering vessels are\r\nnecessarily reversed also. A heavy swell is peculiarly characteristic of\r\nthese storms. In the open sea the swell often extends many leagues\r\nbeyond the range of the gale which produced it.\r\n\r\nWaterspouts are occasioned by small whirlwinds, which always have their\r\norigin at a great distance from that part of the sea from which the\r\nspout begins to rise, where it is generally calm. The whirl is produced\r\nby two currents of air, which, running in opposite directions, compress\r\none another by their impetus, so that they rise in spiral eddies to the\r\nclouds. They move slowly along the surface of the sea, sometimes in\r\nvertical, and sometimes in twisted spirals, putting the sea into violent\r\nagitation as they pass, and carrying the water aloft by the force of\r\ngyration. Occasionally the eddies begin in the clouds and dip down to\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION XVI.\r\n\r\nSound—Propagation of Sound illustrated by a Field of Standing\r\n  Corn—Nature of Waves—Propagation of Sound through the\r\n  Atmosphere—Intensity—Noises—A Musical Sound—Quality—Pitch—Extent of\r\n  Human Hearing—Velocity of Sound in Air, Water, and Solids—Causes of\r\n  the Obstruction of Sound—Law of its Intensity—Reflection of\r\n  Sound—Echoes—Thunder—Refraction of Sound—Interference of Sounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE of the most important uses of the atmosphere is the conveyance of\r\nsound. Without the air, deathlike silence would prevail through nature,\r\nfor in common with all substances it has a tendency to impart vibrations\r\nto bodies in contact with it. Therefore undulations received by the air,\r\nwhether it be from a sudden impulse, such as an explosion or the\r\nvibrations of a musical chord, are propagated in every direction, and\r\nproduce the sensation of sound upon the auditory nerves. A bell rung\r\nunder the exhausted receiver of an air-pump is inaudible, which shows\r\nthat the atmosphere is really the medium of sound. In the small\r\nundulations of deep water in a calm, the vibrations of the liquid\r\nparticles are made in the vertical plane, that is, up and down, or at\r\nright angles to the direction of the transmission of the waves. But the\r\nvibrations of the particles of air which produce sound differ from\r\nthese, being performed in the same direction in which the waves of sound\r\ntravel. The propagation of sound has been illustrated by a field of corn\r\nagitated by the wind. However irregular the motion of the corn may seem\r\non a superficial view, it will be found, if the velocity of the wind be\r\nconstant, that the waves are all precisely similar and equal, and that\r\nall are separated by equal intervals and move in equal times.\r\n\r\nA sudden blast depresses each ear equally and successively in the\r\ndirection of the wind, but, in consequence of the elasticity of the\r\nstalks and the force of the impulse, each ear not only rises again as\r\nsoon as the pressure is removed, but bends back nearly as much in the\r\ncontrary direction, and then continues to oscillate backwards and\r\nforwards in equal times, like a pendulum, to a less and less extent,\r\ntill the resistance of the air puts a stop to the motion. These\r\nvibrations are the same for every individual ear of corn. Yet, as their\r\noscillations do not all commence at the same time, but successively, the\r\nears will have a variety of positions at any one instant. Some of the\r\nadvancing ears will meet others in their returning vibrations, and, as\r\nthe times of oscillation are equal for all, they will be crowded\r\ntogether at regular intervals. Between these there will occur equal\r\nspaces where the ears will be few, in consequence of being bent in\r\nopposite directions; and at other equal intervals they will be in their\r\nnatural upright positions. So that over the whole field there will be a\r\nregular series of condensations and rarefactions among the ears of corn,\r\nseparated by equal intervals, where they will be in their natural state\r\nof density. In consequence of these changes the field will be marked by\r\nan alternation of bright and dark bands. Thus the successive waves which\r\nfly over the corn with the speed of the wind are totally distinct from,\r\nand entirely independent of the extent of the oscillations of each\r\nindividual ear, though both take place in the same direction. The length\r\nof a wave is equal to the space between two ears precisely in the same\r\nstate of motion, or which are moving similarly, and the time of the\r\nvibration of each ear is equal to that which elapses between the arrival\r\nof two successive waves at the same point. The only difference between\r\nthe undulations of a corn-field and those of the air which produce sound\r\nis, that each ear of corn is set in motion by an external cause, and is\r\nuninfluenced by the motion of the rest; whereas in air, which is a\r\ncompressible and elastic fluid, when one particle begins to oscillate,\r\nit communicates its vibrations to the surrounding particles, which\r\ntransmit them to those adjacent, and so on continually. Hence from the\r\nsuccessive vibrations of the particles of air the same regular\r\ncondensations and rarefactions take place as in the field of corn,\r\nproducing waves throughout the whole mass of air, though each molecule\r\nlike each individual ear of corn never moves far from its state of rest.\r\nThe small waves of a liquid, and the undulations of the air, like waves\r\nin the corn, are evidently not real masses moving in the direction in\r\nwhich they are advancing, but merely outlines, motions, or forms passing\r\nalong, and comprehending all the particles of an undulating fluid which\r\nare at once in a vibratory state. It is thus that an impulse given to\r\nany one point of the atmosphere is successively propagated in all\r\ndirections, in a wave diverging as from the centre of a sphere to\r\ngreater and greater distances, but with decreasing intensity, in\r\nconsequence of the increasing number of particles of inert matter which\r\nthe force has to move; like the waves formed in still water by a falling\r\nstone, which are propagated circularly all around the centre of\r\ndisturbance (N. 160).\r\n\r\nThe intensity of sound depends upon the violence and extent of the\r\ninitial vibrations of air; but, whatever they may be, each undulation\r\nwhen once formed can only be transmitted straight forwards, and never\r\nreturns back again unless when reflected by an opposing obstacle. The\r\nvibrations of the aërial molecules are always extremely small, whereas\r\nthe waves of sound vary from a few inches to several feet. The various\r\nmusical instruments, the human voice and that of animals, the singing of\r\nbirds, the hum of insects, the roar of the cataract, the whistling of\r\nthe wind, and the other nameless peculiarities of sound, show at once an\r\ninfinite variety in the modes of aërial vibration, and the astonishing\r\nacuteness and delicacy of the ear, thus capable of appreciating the\r\nminutest differences in the laws of molecular oscillation.\r\n\r\nAll mere noises are occasioned by irregular impulses communicated to the\r\near; and, if they be short, sudden, and repeated beyond a certain degree\r\nof quickness, the ear loses the intervals of silence, and the sound\r\nappears continuous. Still such sounds will be mere noise: in order to\r\nproduce a musical sound, the impulses, and consequently the undulations\r\nof the air, must be all exactly similar in duration and intensity, and\r\nmust recur after exactly equal intervals of time. If a blow be given to\r\nthe nearest of a series of broad, flat, and equidistant palisades, set\r\nedgewise in a line direct from the ear, each palisade will repeat or\r\necho the sound; and these echoes, returning to the ear at successive\r\nequal intervals of time, will produce a musical note. The quality of a\r\nmusical note depends upon the abruptness, and its intensity upon the\r\nviolence and extent of the original impulse. In the theory of harmony\r\nthe only property of sound taken into consideration is the pitch, which\r\nvaries with the rapidity of the vibrations. The grave or low tones are\r\nproduced by very slow vibrations, which increase in frequency as the\r\nnote becomes more acute. The lowest man’s voice makes 396 vibrations in\r\na second, whilst the highest woman’s voice makes 2112. Very deep tones\r\nare not heard by all alike, and Dr. Wollaston, who made a variety of\r\nexperiments on the sense of hearing, found that many people, though not\r\nat all deaf, are quite insensible to the cry of the bat or the cricket,\r\nwhile to others it is painfully shrill. From his experiments he\r\nconcluded that human hearing is limited to about nine octaves, extending\r\nfrom the lowest note of the organ to the highest known cry of insects;\r\nand he observes with his usual originality that, “as there is nothing in\r\nthe nature of the atmosphere to prevent the existence of vibrations\r\nincomparably more frequent than any of which we are conscious, we may\r\nimagine that animals like the Grylli, whose powers appear to commence\r\nnearly where ours terminate, may have the faculty of hearing still\r\nsharper sounds which we do not know to exist, and that there may be\r\nother insects hearing nothing in common with us, but endowed with a\r\npower of exciting, and a sense which perceives vibrations, of the same\r\nnature indeed as those which constitute our ordinary sounds, but so\r\nremote that the animals which perceive them may be said to possess\r\nanother sense, agreeing with our own solely in the medium by which it is\r\nexcited.”\r\n\r\nM. Savart, so well known for the number and beauty of his researches in\r\nacoustics, has proved that a high note of a given intensity, being heard\r\nby some ears and not by others, must not be attributed to its pitch, but\r\nto its feebleness. His experiments, and those more recently made by\r\nProfessor Wheatstone, show that, if the pulses could be rendered\r\nsufficiently powerful, it would be difficult to fix a limit to human\r\nhearing at either end of the scale. M. Savart had a wheel made about\r\nnine inches in diameter with 360 teeth set at equal distances round its\r\nrim, so that while in motion each tooth successively hit on a piece of\r\ncard. The tone increased in pitch with the rapidity of the rotation, and\r\nwas very pure when the number of strokes did not exceed three or four\r\nthousand in a second, but beyond that it became feeble and indistinct.\r\nWith a wheel of a larger size a much higher tone could be obtained,\r\nbecause, the teeth being wider apart, the blows were more intense and\r\nmore separated from one another. With 720 teeth on a wheel thirty-two\r\ninches in diameter, the sound produced by 12,000 strokes in a second was\r\naudible, which corresponds to 24,000 vibrations of a musical chord. So\r\nthat the human ear can appreciate a sound which only lasts the 24,000th\r\npart of a second. This note was distinctly heard by M. Savart and by\r\nseveral people who were present, which convinced him that with another\r\napparatus still more acute sounds might be rendered audible.\r\n\r\nFor the deep tones M. Savart employed a bar of iron, two feet eight\r\ninches long, about two inches broad, and half an inch in thickness,\r\nwhich revolved about its centre as if its arms were the spokes of a\r\nwheel. When such a machine rotates, it impresses a motion on the air\r\nsimilar to its own, and, when a thin board or card is brought close to\r\nits extremities, the current of air is momentarily interrupted at the\r\ninstant each arm of the bar passes before the card; it is compressed\r\nabove the card and dilated below; but the instant the spoke has passed a\r\nrush of air to restore equilibrium makes a kind of explosion, and, when\r\nthese succeed each other rapidly, a musical note is produced of a pitch\r\nproportional to the velocity of the revolution. When M. Savart turned\r\nthis bar slowly, a succession of single beats was heard; as the velocity\r\nbecame greater, the sound was only a rattle; but, as soon as it was\r\nsufficient to give eight beats in a second, a very deep musical note was\r\ndistinctly audible corresponding to sixteen single vibrations in a\r\nsecond, which is the lowest that has hitherto been produced. When the\r\nvelocity of the bar was much increased, the intensity of the sound was\r\nhardly bearable. The spokes of a revolving wheel produce the sensation\r\nof sound, on the very same principle that a burning stick whirled round\r\ngives the impression of a luminous circle. The vibrations excited in the\r\norgan of hearing by one beat have not ceased before another impulse is\r\ngiven. Indeed it is indispensable that the impressions made upon the\r\nauditory nerves should encroach upon each other in order to produce a\r\nfull and continued note. On the whole, M. Savart has come to the\r\nconclusion, that the most acute sounds would be heard with as much ease\r\nas those of a lower pitch, if the duration of the sensation produced by\r\neach pulse could be diminished proportionally to the augmentation of the\r\nnumber of pulses in a given time: and on the contrary, if the duration\r\nof the sensation produced by each pulse could be increased in proportion\r\nto their number in a given time, that the deepest tones would be as\r\naudible as any of the others.\r\n\r\nThe velocity of sound is uniform and independent of the nature, extent,\r\nand intensity of the primitive disturbance. Consequently sounds of every\r\nquality and pitch travel with equal speed. The smallest difference in\r\ntheir velocity is incompatible either with harmony or melody, for notes\r\nof different pitches and intensities, sounded together at a little\r\ndistance, would arrive at the ear in different times. A rapid succession\r\nof notes would in this case produce confusion and discord. But, as the\r\nrapidity with which sound is transmitted depends upon the elasticity of\r\nthe medium through which it has to pass, whatever tends to increase the\r\nelasticity of the air must also accelerate the motion of sound. On that\r\naccount its velocity is greater in warm than in cold weather, supposing\r\nthe pressure of the atmosphere constant. In dry air, at the freezing\r\ntemperature, sound travels at the rate of 1090 feet in a second, and for\r\nany higher temperature one foot must be added for every degree of the\r\nthermometer above 32°: hence at 62° of Fahrenheit its speed in a second\r\nis 1120 feet, or 765 miles an hour, which is about three-fourths of the\r\ndiurnal velocity of the earth’s equator. Since all the phenomena of the\r\ntransmission of sound are simple consequences of the physical properties\r\nof the air, they have been predicted and computed rigorously by the laws\r\nof mechanics. It was found, however, that the velocity of sound,\r\ndetermined by observation, exceeded what it ought to have been\r\ntheoretically by 173 feet, or about one-sixth of the whole amount. La\r\nPlace suggested that this discrepancy might arise from the increased\r\nelasticity of the air in consequence of a development of latent or\r\nabsorbed heat (N. 178) during the undulations of sound, and calculation\r\nconfirmed the accuracy of his views. The aërial molecules being suddenly\r\ncompressed give out their absorbed heat; and, as air is too bad a\r\nconductor to carry it rapidly off, it occasions a momentary and local\r\nrise of temperature, which, increasing the elasticity of the air without\r\nat the same time increasing its inertia, causes the movement to be\r\npropagated more rapidly. Analysis gives the true velocity of sound in\r\nterms of the elevation of temperature that a mass of air is capable of\r\ncommunicating to itself, by the disengagement of its own absorbed heat\r\nwhen suddenly compressed in a given ratio. This change of temperature\r\nhowever could not be obtained _directly_ by any experiments which had\r\nbeen made at that epoch; but by inverting the problem, and assuming the\r\nvelocity of sound as given by experiment, it was computed that the\r\ntemperature of a mass of air is raised nine-tenths of a degree when the\r\ncompression is equal to 1/116 of its volume.\r\n\r\nProbably all liquids are elastic, though considerable force is required\r\nto compress them. Water suffers a condensation of nearly 0·0000496 for\r\nevery atmosphere of pressure, and is consequently capable of conveying\r\nsound even more rapidly than air, the velocity in the former being 4708\r\nfeet in a second. A person under water hears sounds made in air feebly,\r\nbut those produced in water very distinctly. According to the\r\nexperiments of M. Colladon, the sound of a bell was conveyed under water\r\nthrough the Lake of Geneva to the distance of about nine miles. He also\r\nperceived that the progress of sound through water is greatly impeded by\r\nthe interposition of any object, such as a projecting wall; consequently\r\nsound under water resembles light in having a distinct shadow. It has\r\nmuch less in air, being transmitted all round buildings or other\r\nobstacles, so as to be heard in every direction, though often with a\r\nconsiderable diminution of intensity, as when a carriage turns the\r\ncorner of a street.\r\n\r\nThe velocity of sound in passing through solids is in proportion to\r\ntheir hardness, and is much greater than in air or water. A sound which\r\ntakes some time in travelling through the air passes almost\r\ninstantaneously along a wire six hundred feet long; consequently it is\r\nheard twice—first as communicated by the wire, and afterwards through\r\nthe medium of the air. The facility with which the vibrations of sound\r\nare transmitted along the grain of a log of wood is well known. Indeed\r\nthey pass through iron, glass, and some kinds of wood, at the rate of\r\n18,530 feet in a second. The velocity of sound is obstructed by a\r\nvariety of circumstances, such as falling snow, fog, rain, or any other\r\ncause which disturbs the homogeneity of the medium through which it has\r\nto pass. M. de Humboldt says that it is on account of the greater\r\nhomogeneity of the atmosphere during the night that sounds are then\r\nbetter heard than during the day, when its density is perpetually\r\nchanging from partial variations of temperature. His attention was\r\ncalled to this subject on the plain surrounding the Mission of the\r\nApures by the rushing noise of the great cataracts of the Orinoco, which\r\nseemed to be three times as loud by night as by day. This he illustrated\r\nby experiment. A tall glass half full of champagne cannot be made to\r\nring as long as the effervescence lasts. In order to produce a musical\r\nnote, the glass together with the liquid it contains must vibrate in\r\nunison as a system, which it cannot do in consequence of the fixed air\r\nrising through the wine and disturbing its homogeneity, because, the\r\nvibrations of the gas being much slower than those of the liquid, the\r\nvelocity of the sound is perpetually interrupted. For the same reason\r\nthe transmission of sound as well as light is impeded in passing through\r\nan atmosphere of variable density. Sir John Herschel, in his admirable\r\nTreatise on Sound, thus explains the phenomenon:—“It is obvious,” he\r\nsays, “that sound as well as light must be obstructed, stifled, and\r\ndissipated from its original direction by the mixture of air of\r\ndifferent temperatures, and consequently elasticities; and thus the same\r\ncause which produces that extreme transparency of the air at night,\r\nwhich astronomers alone fully appreciate, renders it also more\r\nfavourable to sound. There is no doubt, however, that the universal and\r\ndead silence generally prevalent at night renders our auditory nerves\r\nsensible to impressions which would otherwise escape notice. The analogy\r\nbetween sound and light is perfect in this as in so many other respects.\r\nIn the general light of day the stars disappear. In the continual hum of\r\nvoices, which is always going on by day, and which reach us from all\r\nquarters, and never leave the ear time to attain complete tranquillity,\r\nthose feeble sounds which catch our attention at night make no\r\nimpression. The ear, like the eye, requires long and perfect repose to\r\nattain its utmost sensibility.”\r\n\r\nMany instances may be brought in proof of the strength and clearness\r\nwith which sound passes over the surface of water or ice. Lieutenant\r\nForster was able to carry on a conversation across Port Bowen Harbour,\r\nwhen frozen, a distance of a mile and a half.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of sound depends upon the extent of the excursions of the\r\nfluid molecules, on the energy of the transient condensations and\r\ndilatations, and on the greater or less number of particles which\r\nexperience these effects. We estimate that intensity by the impetus of\r\nthese fluid molecules on our organs, which is consequently as the square\r\nof the velocity, and not by their inertia, which is as the simple\r\nvelocity. Were the latter the case, there would be no sound, because the\r\ninertia of the receding waves of air would destroy the equal and\r\nopposite inertia of those advancing; whence it may be concluded that the\r\nintensity of sound diminishes inversely as the square of the distance\r\nfrom its origin. In a tube, however, the force of sound does not decay\r\nas in open air, unless perhaps by friction against the sides. M. Biot\r\nfound, from a number of highly-interesting experiments made on the pipes\r\nof the aqueducts in Paris, that a continued conversation could be\r\ncarried on in the lowest possible whisper through a cylindrical tube\r\nabout 3120 feet long, the time of transmission through that space being\r\n2·79 seconds. In most cases sound diverges in all directions so as to\r\noccupy at any one time a spherical surface; but Dr. Young has shown that\r\nthere are exceptions, as, for example, when a flat surface vibrates only\r\nin one direction. The sound is then most intense when the ear is at\r\nright angles to the surface, whereas it is scarcely audible in a\r\ndirection precisely perpendicular to its edge. In this case it is\r\nimpossible that the whole of the surrounding air can be affected in the\r\nsame manner, since the particles behind the sounding surface must be\r\nmoving towards it whenever the particles before it are retreating. Hence\r\nin one half of the surrounding sphere of air its motions are retrograde,\r\nwhile in the other half they are direct; consequently, at the edges\r\nwhere these two portions meet, the motions of the air will neither be\r\nretrograde nor direct, and therefore it must be at rest.\r\n\r\nIt appears, from theory as well as daily experience, that sound is\r\ncapable of reflection from surfaces (N. 179) according to the same laws\r\nas light. Indeed any one who has observed the reflection of the waves\r\nfrom a wall on the side of a river, after the passage of a steam-boat,\r\nwill have a perfect idea of the reflection of sound and of light. As\r\nevery substance in nature is more or less elastic, it may be agitated\r\naccording to its own law by the impulse of a mass of undulating air; and\r\nreciprocally the surface by its reaction will communicate its\r\nundulations back again into the air. Such reflections produce echoes;\r\nand as a series of them may take place between two or more obstacles,\r\neach will cause an echo of the original sound, growing fainter and\r\nfainter till it dies away; because sound, like light, is weakened by\r\nreflection. Should the reflecting surface be concave towards a person,\r\nthe sound will converge towards him with increased intensity, which will\r\nbe greater still if the surface be spherical and concentric with him.\r\nUndulations of sound diverging from one focus of an elliptical shell\r\n(N. 180) converge in the other after reflection. Consequently a sound\r\nfrom the one will be heard in the other as if it were close to the ear.\r\nThe rolling noise of thunder has been attributed to reverberation\r\nbetween different clouds, which may possibly be the case to a certain\r\nextent. Sir John Herschel is of opinion that an intensely prolonged peal\r\nis probably owing to a combination of sounds, because, the velocity of\r\nelectricity being incomparably greater than that of sound, the thunder\r\nmay be regarded as originating in every point of a flash of lightning at\r\nthe same instant. The sound from the nearest point will arrive first;\r\nand if the flash run in a direct line from a person, the noise will come\r\nlater and later from the remote points of its path in a continued roar.\r\nShould the direction of the flash be inclined, the succession of sounds\r\nwill be more rapid and intense: and if the lightning describe a circular\r\ncurve round a person, the sound will arrive from every point at the same\r\ninstant with a stunning crash. In like manner the subterranean noises\r\nheard during earthquakes like distant thunder may arise from the\r\nconsecutive arrival at the ear of undulations propagated at the same\r\ninstant from nearer and more remote points; or if they originate in the\r\nsame point, the sound may come by different routes through strata of\r\ndifferent densities.\r\n\r\nSounds under water are heard very distinctly in the air immediately\r\nabove; but the intensity decays with great rapidity as the observer goes\r\nfarther off, and is altogether inaudible at the distance of two or three\r\nhundred yards. So that waves of sound, like those of light, in passing\r\nfrom a dense to a rare medium, are not only refracted, but suffer total\r\nreflection at very oblique incidences (N. 189).\r\n\r\nThe laws of interference extend also to sound. It is clear that two\r\nequal and similar musical strings will be in unison if they communicate\r\nthe same number of vibrations to the air in the same time. But if two\r\nsuch strings be so nearly in unison that one performs a hundred\r\nvibrations in a second, and the other a hundred and one in the same\r\nperiod—during the first few vibrations the two resulting sounds will\r\ncombine to form one of double the intensity of either, because the\r\naërial waves will sensibly coincide in time and place; but one will\r\ngradually gain on the other till at the fiftieth vibration it will be\r\nhalf an oscillation in advance. Then the waves of air which produce the\r\nsound being sensibly equal, but the receding part of the one coinciding\r\nwith the advancing part of the other, they will destroy one another, and\r\noccasion an instant of silence. The sound will be renewed immediately\r\nafter, and will gradually increase till the hundredth vibration, when\r\nthe two waves will combine to produce a sound double the intensity of\r\neither. These intervals of silence and greatest intensity, called beats,\r\nwill recur every second; but if the notes differ much from one another,\r\nthe alternations will resemble a rattle; and if the strings be in\r\nperfect unison, there will be no beats, since there will be no\r\ninterference. Thus by interference is meant the co-existence of two\r\nundulations in which the lengths of the waves are the same. And as the\r\nmagnitude of an undulation may be diminished by the addition of another\r\ntransmitted in the same direction, it follows that one undulation may be\r\nabsolutely destroyed by another when waves of the same length are\r\ntransmitted in the same direction, provided that the maxima of the\r\nundulations are equal, and that one follows the other by half the length\r\nof a wave. A tuning-fork affords a good example of interference. When\r\nthat instrument vibrates, its two branches alternately recede from and\r\napproach one another; each communicates its vibrations to the air, and a\r\nmusical note is the consequence. If the fork be held upright about a\r\nfoot from the ear, and turned round its axis while vibrating, at every\r\nquarter revolution the sound will scarcely be heard, while at the\r\nintermediate points it will be strong and clear. This phenomenon arises\r\nfrom the interference of the undulations of air coming from the two\r\nbranches of the fork. When the two branches coincide, or when they are\r\nat equal distances from the ear, the waves of air combine to reinforce\r\neach other; but at the quadrants, where the two branches are at unequal\r\ndistances from the ear, the lengths of the waves differ by half an\r\nundulation, and consequently destroy one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION XVII.\r\n\r\nVibration of Musical Strings—Harmonic Sounds—Nodes—Vibration of Air in\r\n  Wind-Instruments—Vibration of Solids—Vibrating\r\n  Plates—Bells—Harmony—Sounding Boards—Forced\r\n  Vibrations—Resonance—Speaking Machines.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN the particles of elastic bodies are suddenly disturbed by an\r\nimpulse, they return to their natural position by a series of\r\nisochronous vibrations, whose rapidity, force, and permanency depend\r\nupon the elasticity, the form, and the mode of aggregation which unites\r\nthe particles of the body. These oscillations are communicated to the\r\nair, and on account of its elasticity they excite alternate\r\ncondensations and dilatations in the strata of the fluid nearest to the\r\nvibrating body; from thence they are propagated to a distance. A string\r\nor wire stretched between two pins, when drawn aside and suddenly let\r\ngo, will vibrate till its own rigidity and the resistance of the air\r\nreduce it to rest. These oscillations may be rotatory, in every plane,\r\nor confined to one plane according as the motion is communicated. In the\r\npiano-forte, where the strings are struck by a hammer at one extremity,\r\nthe vibrations probably consist of a bulge running to and fro from end\r\nto end. Different modes of vibration may be obtained from the same\r\nsonorous body. Suppose a vibrating string to give the lowest C of the\r\npianoforte which is the fundamental note of the string; if it be lightly\r\ntouched exactly in the middle, so as to retain that point at rest, each\r\nhalf will then vibrate twice as fast as the whole, but in opposite\r\ndirections; the ventral or bulging segments will be alternately above\r\nand below the natural position of the string, and the resulting note\r\nwill be the octave above C. When a point at a third of the length of the\r\nstring is kept at rest, the vibrations will be three times as fast as\r\nthose of the whole string, and will give the twelfth above C. When the\r\npoint of rest is one-fourth of the whole, the oscillations will be four\r\ntimes as fast as those of the fundamental note, and will give the double\r\noctave; and so on. These acute sounds are called the harmonics of the\r\nfundamental note. It is clear, from what has been stated, that the\r\nstring thus vibrating could not give these harmonics spontaneously\r\nunless it divided itself at its aliquot parts into two, three, four, or\r\nmore segments in opposite states of vibration separated by points\r\nactually at rest. In proof of this, pieces of paper placed on the string\r\nat the half, third, fourth, or other aliquot points, according to the\r\ncorresponding harmonic sound, will remain on it during its vibration,\r\nbut will instantly fly off from any of the intermediate points. The\r\npoints of rest, called the nodal points of the string, are a mere\r\nconsequence of the law of interferences; for, if a rope fastened at one\r\nend be moved to and fro at the other extremity so as to transmit a\r\nsuccession of equal waves along it, they will be successively reflected\r\nwhen they arrive at the other end of the rope by the fixed point, and in\r\nreturning they will occasionally interfere with the advancing waves;\r\nand, as these opposite undulations will at certain points destroy one\r\nanother, the point of the rope in which this happens will remain at\r\nrest. Thus a series of nodes and ventral segments will be produced whose\r\nnumber will depend upon the tension and the frequency of the alternate\r\nmotions communicated to the moveable end. So, when a string fixed at\r\nboth ends is put in motion by a sudden blow at any point of it, the\r\nprimitive impulse divides itself into two pulses running opposite ways,\r\nwhich are each totally reflected at the extremities, and, running back\r\nagain along the whole length, are again reflected at the other ends. And\r\nthus they will continue to run backwards and forwards, crossing one\r\nanother at each traverse, and occasionally interfering, so as to produce\r\nnodes; so that the motion of a string fastened at both ends consists of\r\na wave or pulse continually doubled back on itself by reflection at the\r\nfixed extremities.\r\n\r\nHarmonics generally co-exist with the fundamental sound in the same\r\nvibrating body. If one of the lowest strings of the pianoforte be\r\nstruck, an attentive ear will not only hear the fundamental note, but\r\nwill detect all the others sounding along with it, though with less and\r\nless intensity as their pitch becomes higher. According to the law of\r\nco-existing undulations, the whole string and each of its aliquot parts\r\nare in different and independent states of vibration at the same time;\r\nand as all the resulting notes are heard simultaneously, not only the\r\nair, but the ear also, vibrates in unison with each at the same instant\r\n(N. 181).\r\n\r\nHarmony consists in an agreeable combination of sounds. When two chords\r\nperform their vibrations in the same time, they are in unison; but, when\r\ntheir vibrations are so related as to have a common period, after a few\r\noscillations they produce concord. Thus, when the vibrations of two\r\nstrings bear a very simple relation to each other, as where one of them\r\nmakes two, three, four, &c., vibrations in the time the other makes one;\r\nor, if it accomplishes three, four, &c., vibrations while the other\r\nmakes two, the result is a concord which is the more perfect the shorter\r\nthe common period. In discords, on the contrary, the beats are\r\ndistinctly audible, which produces a disagreeable and harsh effect,\r\nbecause the vibrations do not bear a simple relation to one another, as\r\nwhere one of two strings makes eight vibrations while the other\r\naccomplishes fifteen. The pleasure afforded by harmony is attributed by\r\nDr. Young to the love of order, and to a predilection for a regular\r\nrepetition of sensations natural to the human mind, which is gratified\r\nby the perfect regularity and rapid recurrence of the vibrations. The\r\nlove of poetry and dancing he conceives to arise in some degree from the\r\nrhythm of the one and the regularity of the motions in the other.\r\n\r\nA blast of air passing over the open end of a tube, as over the reeds in\r\nPan’s pipes; over a hole in one side, as in the flute; or through the\r\naperture called a reed, with a flexible tongue, as in the clarinet, puts\r\nthe internal column of air into longitudinal vibrations by the alternate\r\ncondensations and rarefactions of its particles. At the same time the\r\ncolumn spontaneously divides itself into nodes, between which the air\r\nalso vibrates longitudinally, but with a rapidity inversely proportional\r\nto the length of the divisions, giving the fundamental note or one of\r\nits harmonics. The nodes are produced on the principle of interferences\r\nby the reflection of the longitudinal undulations of the air at the ends\r\nof the pipe, as in the musical string, only that in one case the\r\nundulations are longitudinal, and in the other transverse.\r\n\r\nA pipe, either open or shut at both ends, when sounded, vibrates entire,\r\nor divides itself spontaneously into two, three, four, &c., segments\r\nseparated by nodes. The whole column gives the fundamental note by waves\r\nor vibrations of the same length with the pipe. The first harmonic is\r\nproduced by waves half as long as the tube, the second harmonic by waves\r\na third as long, and so on. The harmonic segments in an open and shut\r\npipe are the same in number, but differently placed. In a shut pipe the\r\ntwo ends are nodes, but in an open pipe there is half a segment at each\r\nextremity, because the air at these points is neither rarefied nor\r\ncondensed, being in contact with that which is external. If one of the\r\nends of the open pipe be closed, its fundamental note will be an octave\r\nlower: the air will now divide itself into three, five, seven, &c.,\r\nsegments; and the wave producing its fundamental note will be twice as\r\nlong as the pipe, so that it will be doubled back (N. 182). All these\r\nnotes may be produced separately by varying the intensity of the blast.\r\nBlowing steadily and gently, the fundamental note will sound; when the\r\nforce of the blast is increased the note will all at once start up an\r\noctave; when the intensity of the wind is augmented the twelfth will be\r\nheard; and, by continuing to increase the force of the blast, the other\r\nharmonics may be obtained, but no force of wind will produce a note\r\nintermediate between these. The harmonics of a flute may be obtained in\r\nthis manner, from the lowest C or D upwards, without altering the\r\nfingering, merely by increasing the intensity of the blast and altering\r\nthe form of the lips. Pipes of the same dimensions, whether of lead,\r\nglass, or wood, give the same tone as to pitch under the same\r\ncircumstances, which shows that the air alone produces the sound.\r\n\r\nMetal springs fastened at one end, when forcibly bent, endeavour to\r\nreturn to rest by a series of vibrations, which give very pleasing\r\ntones, as in musical boxes. Various musical instruments have been\r\nconstructed, consisting of metallic springs thrown into vibration by a\r\ncurrent of air. Among the most perfect of these are Mr. Wheatstone’s\r\nSymphonion, Concertina, and Æolian Organ, instruments of different\r\neffects and capabilities, but all possessing considerable execution and\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nThe Syren is an ingenious instrument, devised by M. Cagniard de la Tour,\r\nfor ascertaining the number of pulsations in a second, corresponding to\r\neach pitch: the notes are produced by jets of air passing through small\r\napertures, arranged at regular distances in a circle on the side of a\r\nbox, before which a disc revolves pierced with the same number of holes.\r\nDuring a revolution of the disc the currents are alternately intercepted\r\nand allowed to pass as many times as there are apertures in it, and a\r\nsound is produced whose pitch depends on the velocity of rotation.\r\n\r\nA glass or metallic rod, when struck at one end, or rubbed in the\r\ndirection of its length with a wet finger, vibrates longitudinally, like\r\na column of air, by the alternate condensation and expansion of its\r\nconstituent particles, producing a clear and beautiful musical note of a\r\nhigh pitch, on account of the rapidity with which these substances\r\ntransmit sound. Rods, surfaces, and, in general, all undulating bodies,\r\nresolve themselves into nodes. But in surfaces the parts which remain at\r\nrest during their vibrations are lines which are curved or plane\r\naccording to the substance, its form, and the mode of vibration. If a\r\nlittle fine dry sand be strewed over the surface of a plate of glass or\r\nmetal, and if undulations be excited by drawing the bow of a violin\r\nacross its edge, it will emit a musical sound, and the sand will\r\nimmediately arrange itself in the nodal lines, where alone it will\r\naccumulate and remain at rest, because the segments of the surface on\r\neach side will be in different states of vibration, the one being\r\nelevated while the other is depressed; and, as these two motions meet in\r\nthe nodal lines, they neutralise one another. These lines vary in form\r\nand position with the part where the bow is drawn across, and the point\r\nby which the plate is held. The motion of the sand shows in what\r\ndirection the vibrations take place. If they be perpendicular to the\r\nsurface, the sand will be violently tossed up and down till it finds the\r\npoints of rest. If they be tangential, the sand will only creep along\r\nthe surface to the nodal lines. Sometimes the undulations are oblique,\r\nor compounded of both the preceding. If a bow be drawn across one of the\r\nangles of a square plate of glass or metal held firmly by the centre,\r\nthe sand will arrange itself in two straight lines parallel to the sides\r\nof the plate, and crossing in the centre so as to divide it into four\r\nequal squares, whose motions will be contrary to each other. Two of the\r\ndiagonal squares will make their excursions on one side of the plate,\r\nwhile the other two make their vibrations on the other side of it. This\r\nmode of vibration produces the lowest tone of the plate (N. 183). If the\r\nplate be still held by the centre, and the bow applied to the middle of\r\none of the sides, the vibrations will be more rapid, and the tone will\r\nbe a fifth higher than in the preceding case: now the sand will arrange\r\nitself from corner to corner, and will divide the plate into four equal\r\ntriangles, each pair of which will make their excursions on opposite\r\nsides of the plate. The nodal lines and pitch vary not only with the\r\npoint where the bow is applied, but with the point by which the plate is\r\nheld, which being at rest necessarily determines the direction of one of\r\nthe quiescent lines. The forms assumed by the sand in square plates are\r\nvery numerous, corresponding to all the various modes of vibration. The\r\nlines in circular plates are even more remarkable for their symmetry,\r\nand upon them the forms assumed by the sand may be classed in three\r\nsystems. The first is the diametrical system, in which the figures\r\nconsist of diameters dividing the circumference of the plate into equal\r\nparts, each of which is in a different state of vibration from those\r\nadjacent. Two diameters, for example, crossing at right angles, divide\r\nthe circumference into four equal parts; three diameters divide it into\r\nsix equal parts; four divide it into eight, and so on. In a metallic\r\nplate, these divisions may amount to thirty-six or forty. The next is\r\nthe concentric system, where the sand arranges itself in circles, having\r\nthe same centre with the plate; and the third is the compound system,\r\nwhere the figures assumed by the sand are compounded of the other two,\r\nproducing very complicated and beautiful forms. Galileo seems to have\r\nbeen the first to notice the points of rest and motion in the\r\nsounding-board of a musical instrument; but to Chladni is due the whole\r\ndiscovery of the symmetrical forms of the nodal lines in vibrating\r\nplates (N. 184). Professor Wheatstone has shown, in a paper read before\r\nthe Royal Society in 1833, that all Chladni’s figures, and indeed all\r\nthe nodal figures of vibrating surfaces, result from very simple modes\r\nof vibration oscillating isochronously, and superposed upon each other;\r\nthe resulting figure varying with the component modes of vibration, the\r\nnumber of the superpositions, and the angles at which they are\r\nsuperposed. For example, if a square plate be vibrating so as to make\r\nthe sand arrange itself in straight lines parallel to one side of the\r\nplate, and if, in addition to this, such vibrations be excited as would\r\nhave caused the sand to form in lines perpendicular to the first had the\r\nplate been at rest, the combined vibrations will make the sand form in\r\nlines from corner to corner (N. 185).\r\n\r\nM. Savart’s experiments on the vibrations of flat glass rulers are\r\nhighly interesting. Let a lamina of glass 27^{in}·56 long, 0·59 of an\r\ninch broad, and 0·06 of an inch in thickness, be held by the edges in\r\nthe middle, with its flat surface horizontal. If this surface be strewed\r\nwith sand, and set in longitudinal vibration by rubbing its under\r\nsurface with a wet cloth, the sand on the upper surface will arrange\r\nitself in lines parallel to the ends of the lamina, always in one or\r\nother of two systems (N. 186). Although the same one of the two systems\r\nwill always be produced by the same plate of glass, yet among different\r\nplates of the preceding dimensions, even though cut from the same sheet\r\nside by side, one will invariably exhibit one system, and the other the\r\nother, without any visible reason for the difference. Now, if the\r\npositions of these quiescent lines be marked on the upper surface, and\r\nif the plate be turned so that the lower surface becomes the upper one,\r\nthe sand being strewed, and vibrations excited as before, the nodal\r\nlines will still be parallel to the ends of the lamina, but their\r\npositions will be intermediate between those of the upper surface\r\n(N. 187). Thus it appears that all the motions of one half of the\r\nthickness of the lamina, or ruler, are exactly contrary to those of the\r\ncorresponding points of the other half. If the thickness of the lamina\r\nbe increased, the other dimensions remaining the same, the sound will\r\nnot vary, but the number of nodal lines will be less. When the breadth\r\nof the lamina exceeds the 0·6 of an inch, the nodal lines become curved,\r\nand are different on the two surfaces. A great variety of forms are\r\nproduced by increasing the breadth and changing the form of the surface;\r\nbut in all it appears that the motions in one half of the thickness are\r\nopposed to those in the other half.\r\n\r\nM. Savart also found, by placing small paper rings round a cylindrical\r\ntube or rod, so as to rest upon it at one point only, that, when the\r\ntube or rod is continually turned on its axis in the same direction, the\r\nrings slide along during the vibrations, till they come to a quiescent\r\npoint, where they rest. By tracing these nodal lines he discovered that\r\nthey twist in a spiral or corkscrew round rods and cylinders, making one\r\nor more turns according to the length; but at certain points, varying in\r\nnumber according to the mode of vibration of the rod, the screw stops,\r\nand recommences on the other side, though it is turned in a contrary\r\ndirection; that is, on one side it is a right-handed screw, on the other\r\na left (N. 188). The nodal lines in the interior surface of the tube are\r\nperfectly similar to those in the exterior, but they occupy intermediate\r\npositions. If a small ivory ball be put within the tube, it will follow\r\nthese nodal lines when the tube is made to revolve on its axis.\r\n\r\nAll solids which ring when struck, such as bells, drinking glasses,\r\ngongs, &c., have their shape momentarily and forcibly changed by the\r\nblow, and from their elasticity, or tendency to resume their natural\r\nform, a series of undulations take place, owing to the alternate\r\ncondensations and rarefactions of the particles of solid matter. These\r\nhave also their harmonic tones, and consequently nodes. Indeed,\r\ngenerally, when a rigid system of any form whatever vibrates either\r\ntransversely or longitudinally, it divides itself into a certain number\r\nof parts which perform their vibrations without disturbing one another.\r\nThese parts are at every instant in alternate states of undulation; and,\r\nas the points or lines where they join partake of both, they remain at\r\nrest, because the opposing motions destroy one another.\r\n\r\nThe air, notwithstanding its rarity, is capable of transmitting its\r\nundulations when in contact with a body susceptible of admitting and\r\nexciting them. It is thus that sympathetic undulations are excited by a\r\nbody vibrating near insulated tended strings, capable of following its\r\nundulations, either by vibrating entire, or by separating themselves\r\ninto their harmonic divisions. If two chords equally stretched, of which\r\none is twice or three times longer than the other, be placed side by\r\nside, and if the shorter be sounded, its vibrations will be communicated\r\nby the air to the other, which will be thrown into such a state of\r\nvibration that it will be spontaneously divided into segments equal in\r\nlength to the shorter string. When a tuning-fork receives a blow and is\r\nmade to rest upon a piano-forte during its vibration, every string\r\nwhich, either by its natural length or by its spontaneous subdivisions,\r\nis capable of executing corresponding vibrations, responds in a\r\nsympathetic note. The same effect will be produced by the stroke of a\r\nbell near a piano or harp. Some one or other of the notes of an organ\r\nare generally in unison with one of the panes or with the whole sash of\r\na window, which consequently resounds when those notes are sounded. A\r\npeal of thunder has frequently the same effect. The sound of very large\r\norgan-pipes is generally inaudible till the air be set in motion by the\r\nundulations of some of the superior accords, and then the sound becomes\r\nextremely energetic. Recurring vibrations occasionally influence each\r\nother’s periods. For example, two adjacent organ-pipes nearly in unison\r\nmay force themselves into concord; and two clocks, whose rates differed\r\nconsiderably when separate, have been known to beat together when fixed\r\nto the same wall, and one clock has forced the pendulum of another into\r\nmotion, when merely standing on the same stone pavement. These forced\r\noscillations, which correspond in their periods with those of the\r\nexciting cause, are to be traced in every department of physical\r\nscience. Several instances of them have already occurred in this work.\r\nSuch are the tides, which follow the sun and moon in all their motions\r\nand periods. The nutation of the earth’s axis also, which corresponds\r\nwith the period, and represents the motion of the nodes of the moon, is\r\nagain reflected back to the moon, and may be traced in the nutation of\r\nthe lunar orbit. And, lastly, the acceleration of the moon’s mean motion\r\nrepresents the action of the planets on the earth reflected by the sun\r\nto the moon.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the facility with which the air communicates\r\nundulations, all the phenomena of vibrating plates may be exhibited by\r\nsand strewed on paper or parchment, stretched over a harmonica glass or\r\nlarge bell-shaped tumbler. In order to give due tension to the paper or\r\nvellum, it must be wetted, stretched over the glass, gummed round the\r\nedges, allowed to dry, and varnished over, to prevent changes in its\r\ntension from the humidity of the atmosphere. If a circular disc of glass\r\nbe held concentrically over this apparatus, with its plane parallel to\r\nthe surface of the paper, and set in vibration by drawing a bow across\r\nits edge, so as to make sand on its surface take any of Chladni’s\r\nfigures, the sand on the paper will assume the very same form, in\r\nconsequence of the vibrations of the disc being communicated to the\r\npaper by the air. When the disc is removed slowly in a horizontal\r\ndirection, the forms on the paper will correspond with those on the\r\ndisc, till the distance is too great for the air to convey the\r\nvibrations. If the disc while vibrating be gradually more and more\r\ninclined to the horizon, the figures on the paper will vary by degrees;\r\nand, when the vibrating disc is perpendicular to the horizon, the sand\r\non the paper will form into straight lines parallel to the surface of\r\nthe disc, by creeping along it instead of dancing up and down. If the\r\ndisc be made to turn round its vertical diameter while vibrating, the\r\nnodal lines on the paper will revolve, and exactly follow the motion of\r\nthe disc. It appears, from this experiment, that the motions of the\r\naërial molecules in every part of a spherical wave, propagated from a\r\nvibrating body as a centre, are parallel to each other, and not\r\ndivergent like the radii of a circle. When a slow air is played on a\r\nflute near this apparatus, each note calls up a particular form in the\r\nsand, which the next note effaces, to establish its own. The motion of\r\nthe sand will even detect sounds that are inaudible. By the vibrations\r\nof sand on a drum-head the besieged have discovered the direction in\r\nwhich a counter-mine was working. M. Savart, who made these beautiful\r\nexperiments, employed this apparatus to discover nodal lines in masses\r\nof air. He found that the air of a room, when thrown into undulations by\r\nthe continued sound of an organ-pipe, or by any other means, divides\r\nitself into masses separated by nodal curves of double curvature, such\r\nas spirals, on each side of which the air is in opposite states of\r\nvibration. He even traced these quiescent lines going out at an open\r\nwindow, and for a considerable distance in the open air. The sand is\r\nviolently agitated where the undulations of the air are greatest, and\r\nremains at rest in the nodal lines. M. Savart observed, that when he\r\nmoved his head away from a quiescent line towards the right the sound\r\nappeared to come from the right, and when he moved it towards the left\r\nthe sound seemed to come from the left, because the molecules of air are\r\nin different states of motion on each side of the quiescent line.\r\n\r\nA musical string gives a very feeble sound when vibrating alone, on\r\naccount of the small quantity of air set in motion; but when attached to\r\na sounding-board, as in the harp and piano-forte, it communicates its\r\nundulations to that surface, and from thence to every part of the\r\ninstrument; so that the whole system vibrates isochronously, and by\r\nexposing an extensive undulating surface, which transmits its\r\nundulations to a great mass of air, the sound is much reinforced. The\r\nintensity is greatest when the vibrations of the string or sounding body\r\nare perpendicular to the sounding-board, and least when they are in the\r\nsame plane with it. The sounding-board of the piano-forte is better\r\ndisposed than that of any other stringed instrument, because the hammers\r\nstrike the strings so as to make them vibrate at right angles to it. In\r\nthe guitar, on the contrary, they are struck obliquely, which renders\r\nthe tone feeble, unless when the sides, which also act as a\r\nsounding-board, are deep. It is evident that the sounding-board and the\r\nwhole instrument are agitated at once by all the superposed vibrations\r\nexcited by the simultaneous or consecutive notes that are sounded, each\r\nhaving its perfect effect independently of the rest. A sounding-board\r\nnot only reciprocates the different degrees of pitch, but all the\r\nnameless qualities of tone. This has been beautifully illustrated by\r\nProfessor Wheatstone in a series of experiments on the transmission\r\nthrough solid conductors of musical performances, from the harp, piano,\r\nviolin, clarinet, &c. He found that all the varieties of pitch, quality,\r\nand intensity are perfectly transmitted with their relative gradations,\r\nand may be communicated, through conducting wires or rods of very\r\nconsiderable length, to a properly disposed sounding-board in a distant\r\napartment. The sounds of an entire orchestra may be transmitted and\r\nreciprocated by connecting one end of a metallic rod with a\r\nsounding-board near the orchestra, so placed as to resound to all the\r\ninstruments, and the other end with the sounding-board of a harp, piano,\r\nor guitar, in a remote apartment. Professor Wheatstone observes, “The\r\neffect of this experiment is very pleasing; the sounds, indeed, have so\r\nlittle intensity as scarcely to be heard at a distance from the\r\nreciprocating instrument; but, on placing the ear close to it, a\r\ndiminutive band is heard in which all the instruments preserve their\r\ndistinctive qualities, and the pianos and fortes, the crescendos and\r\ndiminuendos, their relative contrasts. Compared with an ordinary band\r\nheard at a distance through the air, the effect is as a landscape seen\r\nin miniature beauty through a concave lens, compared with the same scene\r\nviewed by ordinary vision through a murky atmosphere.”\r\n\r\nEvery one is aware of the reinforcement of sound by the resonance of\r\ncavities. When singing or speaking near the aperture of a wide-mouthed\r\nvessel, the intensity of some one note in unison with the air in the\r\ncavity is often augmented to a great degree. Any vessel will resound if\r\na body vibrating the natural note of the cavity be placed opposite to\r\nits orifice, and be large enough to cover it, or at least to set a large\r\nportion of the adjacent air in motion. For the sound will be alternately\r\nreflected by the bottom of the cavity and the undulating body at its\r\nmouth. The first impulse of the undulating substance will be reflected\r\nby the bottom of the cavity, and then by the undulating body, in time to\r\ncombine with the second new impulse. This reinforced sound will also be\r\ntwice reflected in time to conspire with the third new impulse; and, as\r\nthe same process will be repeated on every new impulse, each will\r\ncombine with all its echoes to reinforce the sound prodigiously.\r\nProfessor Wheatstone, to whose ingenuity we are indebted for so much new\r\nand valuable information on the theory of sound, has given some very\r\nstriking instances of resonance. If one of the branches of a vibrating\r\ntuning-fork be brought near the embouchure of a flute, the lateral\r\napertures of which are stopped so as to render it capable of producing\r\nthe same sound as the fork, the feeble and scarcely audible sound of the\r\nfork will be augmented by the rich resonance of the column of air within\r\nthe flute, and the tone will be full and clear. The sound will be found\r\ngreatly to decrease by closing or opening another aperture; for the\r\nalteration in the length of the column of air renders it no longer fit\r\nperfectly to reciprocate the sound of the fork. This experiment may be\r\nmade on a concert flute with a C tuning-fork. But Professor Wheatstone\r\nobserves, that in this case it is generally necessary to finger the\r\nflute for B, because, when blown into with the mouth, the under-lip\r\npartly covers the embouchure, which renders the sound about a semitone\r\nflatter than it would be were the embouchure entirely uncovered. He has\r\nalso shown, by the following experiment, that any one among several\r\nsimultaneous sounds may be rendered separately audible. If two bottles\r\nbe selected, and tuned by filling them with such a quantity of water as\r\nwill render them unisonant with two tuning-forks which differ in pitch,\r\non bringing both of the vibrating tuning-forks to the mouth of each\r\nbottle alternately, in each case that sound only will be heard which is\r\nreciprocated by the unisonant bottle.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts have been made to imitate the articulation of the\r\nletters of the alphabet. About the year 1779, MM. Kratzenstein of St.\r\nPetersburg, and Kempelen of Vienna, constructed instruments which\r\narticulated many letters, words, and even sentences. Mr. Willis of\r\nCambridge has adapted cylindrical tubes to a reed, whose length can be\r\nvaried at pleasure by sliding joints. Upon drawing out a tube while a\r\ncolumn of air from the bellows of an organ is passing through it, the\r\nvowels are pronounced in the order, _i_, _e_, _a_, _o_, _u_. On\r\nextending the tube, they are repeated after a certain interval, in the\r\ninverted order, _u_, _o_, _a_, _e_, _i_. After another interval they are\r\nagain obtained in the direct order, and so on. When the pitch of the\r\nreed is very high, it is impossible to sound some of the vowels, which\r\nis in perfect correspondence with the human voice, female singers being\r\nunable to pronounce _u_ and _o_ in their high notes. From the singular\r\ndiscoveries of M. Savart on the nature of the human voice, and the\r\ninvestigations of Mr. Willis on the mechanism of the larynx, it may be\r\npresumed that ultimately the utterance or pronunciation of modern\r\nlanguages will be conveyed, not only to the eye, but also to the ear of\r\nposterity. Had the ancients possessed the means of transmitting such\r\ndefinite sounds, the civilised world would still have responded in\r\nsympathetic notes at the distance of many ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION XVIII.\r\n\r\nRefraction—Astronomical Refraction and its Laws—Formation of Tables of\r\n  Refraction—Terrestrial Refraction—Its Quantity—Instances of\r\n  extraordinary Refraction—Reflection—Instances of extraordinary\r\n  Reflection—Loss of Light by the Absorbing Power of the\r\n  Atmosphere—Apparent Magnitude of Sun and Moon in the Horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT only everything we hear but all we see is through the medium of the\r\natmosphere. Without some knowledge of its action upon light, it would be\r\nimpossible to ascertain the position of the heavenly bodies, or even to\r\ndetermine the exact place of very distant objects upon the surface of\r\nthe earth; for, in consequence of the refractive power of the air, no\r\ndistant object is seen in its true position.\r\n\r\nAll the celestial bodies appear to be more elevated than they really\r\nare; because the rays of light, instead of moving through the atmosphere\r\nin straight lines, are continually inflected towards the earth. Light\r\npassing obliquely out of a rare into a denser medium, as from vacuum\r\ninto air, or from air into water, is bent or refracted from its course\r\ntowards a perpendicular to that point of the denser surface where the\r\nlight enters it (N. 189). In the same medium, the sine of the angle\r\ncontained between the incident ray and the perpendicular is in a\r\nconstant ratio to the sine of the angle contained by the refracted ray\r\nand the same perpendicular; but this ratio varies with the refracting\r\nmedium. The denser the medium, the more the ray is bent. The barometer\r\nshows that the density of the atmosphere decreases as the height above\r\nthe earth increases. Direct experiments prove that the refractive power\r\nof the air increases with its density. It follows therefore that, if the\r\ntemperature be uniform, the refractive power of the air is greatest at\r\nthe earth’s surface, and diminishes upwards.\r\n\r\nA ray of light from a celestial object falling obliquely on this\r\nvariable atmosphere, instead of being refracted at once from its course,\r\nis gradually more and more bent during its passage through it so as to\r\nmove in a vertical curved line, in the same manner as if the atmosphere\r\nconsisted of an infinite number of strata of different densities. The\r\nobject is seen in the direction of a tangent to that part of the curve\r\nwhich meets the eye; consequently the apparent altitude (N. 190) of the\r\nheavenly bodies is always greater than their true altitude. Owing to\r\nthis circumstance, the stars are seen above the horizon after they are\r\nset, and the day is lengthened from a part of the sun being visible,\r\nthough he really is behind the rotundity of the earth. It would be easy\r\nto determine the direction of a ray of light through the atmosphere if\r\nthe law of the density were known; but, as this law is perpetually\r\nvarying with the temperature, the case is very complicated. When rays\r\npass perpendicularly from one medium into another, they are not bent;\r\nand experience shows, that in the same surface, though the sines of the\r\nangles of incidence and refraction retain the same ratio, the refraction\r\nincreases with the obliquity of incidence (N. 189). Hence it appears\r\nthat the refraction is greatest at the horizon, and at the zenith there\r\nis none. But it is proved that, at all heights above ten degrees,\r\nrefraction varies nearly as the tangent of the angular distance of the\r\nobject from the zenith, and wholly depends upon the heights of the\r\nbarometer and thermometer. For the quantity of refraction at the same\r\ndistance from the zenith varies nearly as the height of the barometer,\r\nthe temperature being constant; and the effect of the variation of\r\ntemperature is to diminish the quantity of refraction by about its 480th\r\npart for every degree in the rise of Fahrenheit’s thermometer. Not much\r\nreliance can be placed on celestial observations, within less than ten\r\nor twelve degrees of the horizon, on account of irregular variations in\r\nthe density of the air near the surface of the earth, which are\r\nsometimes the cause of very singular phenomena. The humidity of the air\r\nproduces no sensible effect on its refractive power; and it has been\r\nproved that the amount of refraction is the same whatever be the\r\nvelocity of the incident light, that is whether the light comes from a\r\nstar in that part of the heavens towards which the earth is going, or\r\nfrom one in that part of the sky whence it is receding.\r\n\r\nBodies, whether luminous or not, are only visible by the rays which\r\nproceed from them. As the rays must pass through strata of different\r\ndensities in coming to us, it follows that, with the exception of stars\r\nin the zenith, no object either in or beyond our atmosphere is seen in\r\nits true place. But the deviation is so small in ordinary cases that it\r\ncauses no inconvenience, though in astronomical and trigonometrical\r\nobservations due allowance must be made for the effects of refraction.\r\nDr. Bradley’s tables of refraction were formed by observing the zenith\r\ndistances of the sun at his greatest declinations, and the zenith\r\ndistances of the pole-star above and below the pole. The sum of these\r\nfour quantities is equal to 180°, diminished by the sum of the four\r\nrefractions, whence the sum of the four refractions was obtained; and,\r\nfrom the law of the variation of refraction determined by theory, he\r\nassigned the quantity due to each altitude (N. 191). The mean horizontal\r\nrefraction is about 35ʹ 6ʺ, and at the height of forty-five degrees it\r\nis 58ʺ·36. The effect of refraction upon the same star above and below\r\nthe pole was noticed by Alhazen, a Saracen astronomer of Spain, in the\r\nninth century; but its existence was known to Ptolemy in the second,\r\nthough he was ignorant of its quantity.\r\n\r\nThe refraction of a terrestrial object is estimated differently from\r\nthat of a celestial body. It is measured by the angle contained between\r\nthe tangent to the curvilineal path of the ray where it meets the eye,\r\nand the straight line joining the eye and the object (N. 192). Near the\r\nearth’s surface the path of the ray may be supposed to be circular; and\r\nthe angle at the centre of the earth corresponding to this path is\r\ncalled the horizontal angle. The quantity of terrestrial refraction is\r\nobtained by measuring contemporaneously the elevation of the top of a\r\nmountain above a point in the plain at its base, and the depression of\r\nthat point below the top of the mountain. The distance between these two\r\nstations is the chord of the horizontal angle; and it is easy to prove\r\nthat double the refraction is equal to the horizontal angle, increased\r\nby the difference between the apparent elevation and the apparent\r\ndepression. Whence it appears that, in the mean state of the atmosphere,\r\nthe refraction is about the fourteenth part of the horizontal angle.\r\n\r\nSome very singular appearances occur from the accidental expansion or\r\ncondensation of the strata of the atmosphere contiguous to the surface\r\nof the earth, by which distant objects, instead of being elevated, are\r\ndepressed. Sometimes, being at once both elevated and depressed, they\r\nappear double, one of the images being direct, and the other inverted.\r\nIn consequence of the upper edges of the sun and moon being less\r\nrefracted than the lower, they often appear to be oval when near the\r\nhorizon. The looming also or elevation of coasts, mountains, and ships,\r\nwhen viewed across the sea, arises from unusual refraction. A friend of\r\nthe author’s, while standing on the plains of Hindostan, saw the whole\r\nupper chain of the Himalaya Mountains start into view, from a sudden\r\nchange in the density of the air, occasioned by a heavy shower after a\r\nvery long course of dry and hot weather. Single and double images of\r\nobjects at sea, arising from sudden changes of temperature which are not\r\nso soon communicated to the water on account of its density as to the\r\nair, occur more rarely and are of shorter duration than similar\r\nappearances on land. In 1818 Captain Scoresby, whose observations on the\r\nphenomena of the polar seas are so valuable, recognised his father’s\r\nship by its inverted image in the air, although the vessel itself was\r\nbelow the horizon. He afterwards found that she was seventeen miles\r\nbeyond the horizon, and thirty miles distant. Two images are sometimes\r\nseen suspended in the air over a ship, one direct and the other\r\ninverted, with their topmasts or their hulls meeting, according as the\r\ninverted image is above or below the direct image (N. 193). Dr.\r\nWollaston has proved that these appearances are owing to the refraction\r\nof the rays through media of different densities, by the very simple\r\nexperiment of looking along a red-hot poker at a distant object. Two\r\nimages are seen, one direct and another inverted, in consequence of the\r\nchange induced by the heat in the density of the adjacent air. He\r\nproduced the same effect by a saline or saccharine solution with water\r\nand spirit of wine floating upon it (N. 194).\r\n\r\nMany of the phenomena that have been ascribed to extraordinary\r\nrefraction seem to be occasioned by a partial or total reflection of the\r\nrays of light at the surfaces of strata of different densities (N. 189).\r\nIt is well known that, when light falls obliquely upon the external\r\nsurface of a transparent medium, as on a plate of glass or a stratum of\r\nair, one portion is reflected and the other transmitted. But, when light\r\nfalls very obliquely upon the internal surface, the whole is reflected,\r\nand not a ray is transmitted. In all cases the angles made by the\r\nincident and reflected rays with a perpendicular to the surface being\r\nequal, as the brightness of the reflected image depends on the quantity\r\nof light, those arising from total reflection must be by far the most\r\nvivid. The delusive appearance of water, so well known to African\r\ntravellers and to the Arab of the desert as the Lake of the Gazelles, is\r\nascribed to the reflection which takes place between strata of air of\r\ndifferent densities, owing to radiation of heat from the arid sandy\r\nplains. The mirage described by Captain Mundy in his Journal of a Tour\r\nin India probably arises from this cause. “A deep precipitous valley\r\nbelow us, at the bottom of which I had seen one or two miserable\r\nvillages in the morning, bore in the evening a complete resemblance to a\r\nbeautiful lake; the vapour which played the part of water ascending\r\nnearly half way up the sides of the vale, and on its bright surface\r\ntrees and rocks being distinctly reflected. I had not been long\r\ncontemplating this phenomenon, before a sudden storm came on and dropped\r\na curtain of clouds over the scene.”\r\n\r\nAn occurrence which happened on the 18th of November, 1804, was probably\r\nproduced by reflection. Dr. Buchan, while watching the rising sun from\r\nthe cliff about a mile to the east of Brighton, at the instant the solar\r\ndisc emerged from the surface of the ocean, saw the cliff on which he\r\nwas standing, a windmill, his own figure and that of a friend, depicted\r\nimmediately opposite to him on the sea. This appearance lasted about ten\r\nminutes, till the sun had risen nearly his own diameter above the\r\nsurface of the waves. The whole then seemed to be elevated into the air,\r\nand successively vanished. The rays of the sun fell upon the cliff at an\r\nincidence of 73° from the perpendicular, and the sea was covered with a\r\ndense fog many yards in height, which gradually receded before the\r\nrising sun. When extraordinary refraction takes place laterally, the\r\nstrata of variable density are perpendicular to the horizon, and, if\r\ncombined with vertical refraction, the objects are magnified as when\r\nseen through a telescope. From this cause, on the 26th of July, 1798,\r\nthe cliffs of France, fifty miles off, were seen as distinctly from\r\nHastings as if they had been close at hand; and even Dieppe was said to\r\nhave been visible in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe stratum of air in the horizon is so much thicker and more dense than\r\nthe stratum in the vertical, that the sun’s light is diminished 1300\r\ntimes in passing through it, which enables us to look at him when\r\nsetting without being dazzled. The loss of light, and consequently of\r\nheat, by the absorbing power of the atmosphere, increases with the\r\nobliquity of incidence. Of ten thousand rays falling on its surface,\r\n8123 arrive at a given point of the earth if they fall perpendicularly;\r\n7024 arrive if the angle of direction be fifty degrees; 2831, if it be\r\nseven degrees; and only five rays will arrive through a horizontal\r\nstratum. Since so great a quantity of light is lost in passing through\r\nthe atmosphere, many celestial objects are altogether invisible from the\r\nplain, which may be seen from elevated situations. Diminished splendour,\r\nand the false estimate we make of distance from the number of\r\nintervening objects, lead us to suppose the sun and moon to be much\r\nlarger when in the horizon than at any other altitude, though their\r\napparent diameters are then somewhat less. Instead of the sudden\r\ntransitions of light and darkness, the reflective power of the air\r\nadorns nature with the rosy and golden hues of the Aurora and twilight.\r\nEven when the sun is eighteen degrees below the horizon, a sufficient\r\nportion of light remains to show that at the height of thirty miles it\r\nis still dense enough to reflect light. The atmosphere scatters the\r\nsun’s rays, and gives all the beautiful tints and cheerfulness of day.\r\nIt transmits the blue light in greatest abundance; the higher we ascend,\r\nthe sky assumes a deeper hue; but, in the expanse of space, the sun and\r\nstars must appear like brilliant specks in profound blackness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION XIX.\r\n\r\nConstitution of Light according to Sir Isaac Newton—Absorption of\r\n  Light—Colours of Bodies—Constitution of Light according to Sir David\r\n  Brewster—New Colours—Fraunhofer’s Dark Lines—Dispersion of Light—The\r\n  Achromatic Telescope—Homogeneous Light—Accidental and Complementary\r\n  Colours—M. Plateau’s Experiments and Theory of Accidental Colours.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is impossible thus to trace the path of a sunbeam through our\r\natmosphere without feeling a desire to know its nature, by what power it\r\ntraverses the immensity of space, and the various modifications it\r\nundergoes at the surfaces and in the interior of terrestrial substances.\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton proved the compound nature of white light, as emitted\r\nfrom the sun, by passing a sunbeam through a glass prism (N. 195),\r\nwhich, separating the rays by refraction, formed a spectrum or oblong\r\nimage of the sun, consisting of seven colours, red, orange, yellow,\r\ngreen, blue, indigo, and violet—of which the red is the least\r\nrefrangible, and the violet the most. But, when he reunited these seven\r\nrays by means of a lens, the compound beam became pure white as before.\r\nHe insulated each coloured ray, and, finding that it was no longer\r\ncapable of decomposition by refraction, concluded that white light\r\nconsists of seven kinds of homogeneous light, and that to the same\r\ncolour the same refrangibility ever belongs, and to the same\r\nrefrangibility the same colour. Since the discovery of absorbent media,\r\nhowever, it appears that this is not the constitution of the solar\r\nspectrum.\r\n\r\nWe know of no substance that is either perfectly opaque or perfectly\r\ntransparent. Even gold may be beaten so thin as to be pervious to light.\r\nOn the contrary, the clearest crystal, the purest air or water, stops or\r\nabsorbs its rays when transmitted, and gradually extinguishes them as\r\nthey penetrate to greater depths. On this account objects cannot be seen\r\nat the bottom of very deep water, and many more stars are visible to the\r\nnaked eye from the tops of mountains than from the valleys. The quantity\r\nof light that is incident on any transparent substance is always greater\r\nthan the sum of the reflected and refracted rays. A small quantity is\r\nirregularly reflected in all directions by the imperfections of the\r\npolish by which we are enabled to see the surface; but a much greater\r\nportion is absorbed by the body. Bodies that reflect all the rays appear\r\nwhite, those that absorb them all seem black; but most substances, after\r\ndecomposing the white light which falls upon them, reflect some colours\r\nand absorb the rest. A violet reflects the violet rays alone and absorbs\r\nthe others. Scarlet cloth absorbs almost all the colours except red.\r\nYellow cloth reflects the yellow rays most abundantly, and blue cloth\r\nthose that are blue. Consequently colour is not a property of matter,\r\nbut arises from the action of matter upon light. In fact, the law of\r\naction and reaction obtains in light as in every other department of\r\nnature, so that light cannot be reflected, refracted, much less\r\nabsorbed, by any medium without being reacted upon by it. Thus a white\r\nriband reflects all the rays, but, when dyed red, the particles of the\r\nsilk acquire the property of reflecting the red rays most abundantly and\r\nof absorbing the others. Upon this property of unequal absorption the\r\ncolours of transparent media depend; for they also receive their colour\r\nfrom their power of stopping or absorbing some of the colours of white\r\nlight, and transmitting others. As, for example, black and red inks,\r\nthough equally homogeneous, absorb different kinds of rays; and, when\r\nexposed to the sun, they become heated in different degrees; while pure\r\nwater seems to transmit all rays equally, and is not sensibly heated by\r\nthe passing light of the sun. The rich dark light transmitted by a\r\nsmalt-blue finger-glass is not a homogeneous colour like the blue or\r\nindigo of the spectrum, but is a mixture of all the colours of white\r\nlight which the glass has not absorbed. The colours absorbed are such as\r\nmixed with the blue tint would form white light. When the spectrum of\r\nseven colours is viewed through a thin plate of this glass, they are all\r\nvisible; and, when the plate is very thick, every colour is absorbed\r\nbetween the extreme red and the extreme violet, the interval being\r\nperfectly black; but, if the spectrum be viewed through a certain\r\nthickness of the glass intermediate between the two, it will be found\r\nthat the middle of the red space, the whole of the orange, a great part\r\nof the green, a considerable part of the blue, a little of the indigo,\r\nand a very little of the violet, vanish, being absorbed by the blue\r\nglass; and that the yellow rays occupy a larger space, covering part of\r\nthat formerly occupied by the orange on one side and by the green on the\r\nother: so that the blue glass absorbs the red light, which when mixed\r\nwith the yellow constitutes orange; and also absorbs the blue light,\r\nwhich when mixed with the yellow forms the part of the green space next\r\nto the yellow. Hence, by absorption, green light is decomposed into\r\nyellow and blue, and orange light into yellow and red: consequently the\r\norange and green rays, though incapable of decomposition by refraction,\r\ncan be resolved by absorption, and actually consist of two different\r\ncolours possessing the same degree of refrangibility. Difference of\r\ncolour, therefore, is not a test of difference of refrangibility, and\r\nthe conclusion deduced by Newton is no longer admissible as a general\r\ntruth. By this analysis of the spectrum, not only with blue glass but\r\nwith a variety of coloured media, Sir David Brewster, so justly\r\ncelebrated for his optical discoveries, is of opinion that the solar\r\nspectrum consists of three primary colours, red, yellow, and blue, each\r\nof which exists throughout its whole extent, but with different degrees\r\nof intensity in different parts; and that the superposition of these\r\nthree produces all the seven hues according as each primary colour is in\r\nexcess or defect. That since a certain portion of red, yellow, and blue\r\nrays constitute white light, the colour of any point of the spectrum may\r\nbe considered as consisting of the predominating colour at that point\r\nmixed with white light. Consequently, “by absorbing the excess of any\r\ncolour at any point of the spectrum above what is necessary to form\r\nwhite light, such white light will appear at that point as never mortal\r\neye looked upon before this experiment, since it possesses the\r\nremarkable property of remaining the same after any number of\r\nrefractions, and of being capable of decomposition by absorption alone.”\r\nThis analysis of light has been called in question by Professor Challis,\r\nof Cambridge, who does not admit of any resolution by absorbing media\r\ndifferent from that by the prism, though he admits that a mixture of\r\nblue and yellow solar light produces green. Professor Stokes, on the\r\ncontrary, does not allow that a mixture of blue and yellow solar light\r\nproduces green, although that mixture produces green when the light is\r\nfrom other sources, for he found the gradation from sunlight to pass\r\nfrom yellow through diluted yellow, white, diluted blue to blue; so he\r\ndoes not admit of Sir David Brewster’s analysis of the spectrum;\r\nhowever, there appears to be still a doubt as to the real character of\r\nthe phenomena presented by certain absorbing substances.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the seven colours of the Newtonian spectrum, Sir John\r\nHerschel has discovered a set of very dark red rays beyond the red\r\nextremity of the spectrum which can only be seen when the eye is\r\ndefended from the glare of the other colours by a dark blue cobalt\r\nglass. He has also found that beyond the extreme violet there are\r\nvisible rays of a lavender gray colour, which may be seen by throwing\r\nthe spectrum on a sheet of paper moistened by the carbonate of soda. The\r\nilluminating power of the different rays of the spectrum varies with the\r\ncolour. The most intense light is in the mean yellow ray, or, according\r\nto M. Fraunhofer, at the boundary of the orange and yellow.\r\n\r\nWhen the prism is very perfect and the sunbeam small, so that the\r\nspectrum may be received on a sheet of white paper in its utmost state\r\nof purity, it presents the appearance of a riband shaded with all the\r\nprismatic colours, having its breadth irregularly striped or subdivided\r\nby an indefinite number of dark, and sometimes black lines. The greater\r\nnumber of these rayless lines are so extremely narrow that it is\r\nimpossible to see them in ordinary circumstances. The best method is to\r\nreceive the spectrum on the object-glass of a telescope, so as to\r\nmagnify them sufficiently to render them visible. This experiment may\r\nalso be made, but in an imperfect manner, by viewing a narrow slit\r\nbetween two nearly closed window-shutters through a very excellent glass\r\nprism held close to the eye, with its refracting angle parallel to the\r\nline of light. The rayless lines in the red portion of the spectrum\r\nbecome most visible as the sun approaches the horizon, while those in\r\nthe blue extremity are most obvious in the middle of the day. When the\r\nspectrum is formed by the sun’s rays, either direct or indirect—as from\r\nthe sky, clouds, rainbow, moon, or planets—the black bands are always\r\nfound to be in the same parts of the spectrum, and under all\r\ncircumstances to maintain the same relative positions. Similar dark\r\nlines are also seen in the light of the stars, in the electric light,\r\nand in the flame of combustible substances, though differently arranged,\r\neach star and each flame having a system of dark lines peculiar to\r\nitself. Dr. Wollaston and M. Fraunhofer, of Munich, discovered these\r\nlines deficient of rays independently of each other. M. Fraunhofer found\r\nthat their number extends to nearly six hundred, but they are much more\r\nnumerous. There are bright lines in the solar spectrum which also\r\nmaintain a fixed position. Among the dark lines, M. Fraunhofer selected\r\nseven of the most remarkable, and determined their distances so\r\naccurately, that they now form standard and invariable points of\r\nreference for measuring the refractive powers of different media on the\r\nrays of light, which renders this department of optics as exact as any\r\nof the physical sciences. These lines are designated by the letters of\r\nthe alphabet, beginning with B, which is in the red near the end of the\r\nspectrum; C is farther advanced in the red; D is in the orange; E in the\r\ngreen; F in the blue; G in the indigo; and H in the violet. By means of\r\nthese fixed points, M. Fraunhofer has ascertained from prismatic\r\nobservation the refrangibility of seven of the principal rays in each of\r\nten different substances solid and liquid. The refraction increased in\r\nall from the red to the violet end of the spectrum. The rays that are\r\nwanting in the solar spectrum, which occasion the dark lines, were\r\nsupposed to be absorbed by the atmosphere of the sun. But the annular\r\neclipse which happened on the 15th of May, 1836, afforded Professor\r\nForbes the means of proving that the dark lines in question cannot be\r\nattributed to the absorption of the solar atmosphere; they were neither\r\nbroader nor more numerous in the spectrum formed during that phenomenon\r\nthan at any other time, though the rays came only from the circumference\r\nof the sun’s disc, and consequently had to traverse a greater depth of\r\nhis atmosphere.\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster found that in certain states of the atmosphere the\r\nobscure lines become much broader, and some of them deeply black; and he\r\nobserved also, that, at the time the sun was setting in a veil of red\r\nlight, part of the luminous spectrum was absorbed, whence he concluded\r\nthat the earth’s atmosphere had absorbed the rays of light which\r\noccupied the dark bands. By direct experiments also the atmosphere was\r\nobserved to act powerfully upon the rayless lines.\r\n\r\nWhen a lens is used along with a prism, longitudinal dark lines of\r\ndifferent breadths are seen to cross the bands, already described, at\r\nright angles; these M. Ragona-Scina and M. Babinet believe to be lines\r\nof interference which exist in light that has passed through a convex\r\nlens.\r\n\r\nThe lines are different both in kind and number in the spectra of gases\r\nand flames. In a highly-magnified spectrum from light passed through\r\nnitrous acid gas, Sir David Brewster counted 2000 dark bands. In the\r\nspectrum of a lamp, and generally of all white flames, none of the\r\ndefective lines are found; so all such flames contain rays which do not\r\nexist in the light of the sun or stars. Brilliant red lines appear in\r\nthe spectrum produced by the combustion of nitre upon charcoal; and in\r\nall artificial flames dark and bright bands exist, sometimes\r\ncorresponding in position with those in the solar spectrum, and\r\nsometimes not.\r\n\r\nA sunbeam received on a screen, after passing through a small round hole\r\nin a window-shutter, appears like a round white spot; but when a prism\r\nis interposed, the beam no longer occupies the same space. It is\r\nseparated into the prismatic colours, and spread over a line of\r\nconsiderable length, while its breadth remains the same with that of the\r\nwhite spot. The act of spreading or separation is called the dispersion\r\nof the coloured rays. Dispersion always takes place in the plane of\r\nrefraction, and is greater as the angle of incidence is greater. It\r\nvaries inversely as the length of a wave of light, and directly as its\r\nvelocity: hence towards the blue end of the spectrum, where the\r\nundulations of the rays are least, the dispersion is greatest.\r\nSubstances have very different dispersive powers; that is to say, the\r\nspectra formed by two equal prisms of different substances, under\r\nprecisely the same circumstances, are of different lengths. Thus, if a\r\nprism of flint-glass and one of crown-glass of equal refracting angles\r\nbe presented to two rays of white light at equal angles, it will be\r\nfound that the space over which the coloured rays are dispersed by the\r\nflint-glass is much greater than the space occupied by that produced by\r\nthe crown-glass: and as the quantity of dispersion depends upon the\r\nrefracting angle of the prism, the angles of the two prisms may be made\r\nsuch that, when the prisms are placed close together with their edges\r\nturned opposite ways, they will exactly oppose each other’s action, and\r\nwill refract the coloured rays equally, but in contrary directions, so\r\nthat an exact compensation will be effected, and the light will be\r\nrefracted without colour (N. 195). The achromatic telescope is\r\nconstructed on this principle. It consists of a tube with an\r\nobject-glass or lens at one end to bring the rays to a focus, and form\r\nan image of the distant object, and a magnifying-glass at the other end\r\nto view the image thus formed. Now it is found that the object-glass,\r\ninstead of making the rays converge to one point, disperses them, and\r\ngives a confused and coloured image: but by constructing it of two\r\nlenses in contact, one of flint and the other of crown-glass of certain\r\nforms and proportions, the dispersion is counteracted, and a perfectly\r\nwell-defined and colourless image of the object is formed (N. 196). It\r\nwas thought to be impossible to produce refraction without colour, till\r\nMr. Hall, a gentleman of Worcestershire, constructed a telescope on this\r\nprinciple in the year 1733; and twenty-five years afterwards the\r\nachromatic telescope was brought to perfection by Mr. Dollond, a\r\ncelebrated optician in London.\r\n\r\nBy means of Mr. Fraunhofer’s determination of the refraction of the\r\nprincipal rays in substances, their dispersive powers may be found\r\n(N. 197).\r\n\r\nA perfectly homogeneous colour is very rarely to be found; but the tints\r\nof all substances are most brilliant when viewed in light of their own\r\ncolour. The red of a wafer is much more vivid in red than in white\r\nlight; whereas, if placed in homogeneous yellow light, it can no longer\r\nappear red, because there is not a ray of red in the yellow light. Were\r\nit not that the wafer, like all other bodies, whether coloured or not,\r\nreflects white light at its outer surface, it would appear absolutely\r\nblack when placed in yellow light.\r\n\r\nAfter looking steadily for a short time at a coloured object, such as a\r\nred wafer, on turning the eyes to a white substance, a green image of\r\nthe wafer appears, which is called the accidental colour of red. All\r\ntints have their accidental colours: thus the accidental colour of\r\norange is blue; that of yellow is indigo; of green, reddish white; of\r\nblue, orange-red; of violet, yellow; and of white, black; and _vice\r\nversâ_. When the direct and accidental colours are of the same\r\nintensity, the accidental is then called the complementary colour,\r\nbecause any two colours are said to be complementary to one another\r\nwhich produce white when combined.\r\n\r\nFrom experiments by M. Plateau of Brussels, it appears that two\r\ncomplementary colours from direct impression, which would produce white\r\nwhen combined, produce black, or extinguish one another, by their union,\r\nwhen accidental; and also that the combination of all the tints of the\r\nsolar spectrum produces white light if they be from a direct impression\r\non the eye, whereas blackness results from a union of the same tints if\r\nthey be accidental; and in every case where the real colours produce\r\nwhite by their combination, the accidental colours of the same tints\r\nproduce black. When the image of an object is impressed on the retina\r\nonly for a few moments, the picture left is exactly of the same colour\r\nwith the object, but in an extremely short time the picture is succeeded\r\nby the accidental image. M. Plateau attributes this phenomenon to a\r\nreaction of the retina after being excited by direct vision, so that the\r\naccidental impression is of an opposite nature to the corresponding\r\ndirect impression. He conceives that when the eye is excited by being\r\nfixed for a time on a coloured object, and then withdrawn from the\r\nexcitement, it endeavours to return to its state of repose; but in so\r\ndoing, that it passes this point, and spontaneously assumes an opposite\r\ncondition, like a spring which, bent in one direction, in returning to\r\nits state of rest bends as much the contrary way. The accidental image\r\nthus results from a particular modification of the organ of sight, in\r\nvirtue of which it spontaneously gives us a new sensation after it has\r\nbeen excited by direct vision. If the prevailing impression be a very\r\nstrong white light, its accidental image is not black, but a variety of\r\ncolours in succession. According to M. Plateau, the retina offers a\r\nresistance to the action of light, which increases with the duration of\r\nthis action; whence, after looking intently at an object for a long\r\ntime, it appears to decrease in brilliancy. The imagination has a\r\npowerful influence on our optical impressions, and has been known to\r\nrevive the images of highly luminous objects months, and even years,\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION XX.\r\n\r\nInterference of Light—Undulatory Theory of Light—Propagation of\r\n  Light—Newton’s Rings—Measurement of the Length of the Waves of Light,\r\n  and of the Frequency of the Vibrations of Ether for each\r\n  Colour—Newton’s Scale of Colours—Diffraction of Light—Sir John\r\n  Herschel’s Theory of the Absorption of Light—Refraction and Reflection\r\n  of Light.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWTON and most of his immediate successors imagined light to be a\r\nmaterial substance, emitted by all self-luminous bodies in extremely\r\nminute particles, moving in straight lines with prodigious velocity,\r\nwhich, by impinging upon the optic nerves, produce the sensation of\r\nlight. Many of the observed phenomena have been explained by this\r\ntheory; it is, however, totally inadequate to account for the following\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen two equal rays of red light, proceeding from two luminous points,\r\nfall upon a sheet of white paper in a dark room, they produce a red spot\r\non it which will be twice as bright as either ray would produce singly,\r\nprovided the difference in the lengths of the two beams, from the\r\nluminous points to the red spot on the paper, be exactly the 0·0000258th\r\npart of an inch. The same effect will take place if the difference in\r\nthe lengths be twice, three times, four times, &c., that quantity. But\r\nif the difference in the lengths of the two rays be equal to one-half of\r\nthe 0·0000258th part of an inch, or to its 1-1/2, 2-1/2, 3-1/2, &c.,\r\npart, the one light will entirely extinguish the other, and will produce\r\nabsolute darkness on the paper where the united beams fall. If the\r\ndifference in the lengths of their paths be equal to the 1-1/4, 2-1/4,\r\n3-1/4, &c., of the 0·0000258th part of an inch, the red spot arising\r\nfrom the combined beams will be of the same intensity which one alone\r\nwould produce. If violet light be employed, the difference in the\r\nlengths of the two beams must be equal to the 0·0000157th part of an\r\ninch, in order to produce the same phenomena; and for the other colours,\r\nthe difference must be intermediate between the 0·0000258th and the\r\n0·0000157th part of an inch. Similar phenomena may be seen by viewing\r\nthe flame of a candle through two very fine slits in a card extremely\r\nnear to one another (N. 198); or by admitting the sun’s light into a\r\ndark room through a pin-hole about the fortieth of an inch in diameter,\r\nreceiving the image on a sheet of white paper, and holding a slender\r\nwire in the light. Its shadow will be found to consist of a bright white\r\nbar or stripe in the middle, with a series of alternate black and\r\nbrightly-coloured stripes on each side. The rays which bend round the\r\nwire in two streams are of equal lengths in the middle stripe; it is\r\nconsequently doubly bright from their combined effect; but the rays\r\nwhich fall on the paper on each side of the bright stripe, being of such\r\nunequal lengths as to destroy one another, form black lines. On each\r\nside of these black lines the rays are again of such lengths as to\r\ncombine to form bright stripes, and so on alternately till the light is\r\ntoo faint to be visible. When any homogeneous light is used, such as\r\nred, the alternations are only black and red; but on account of the\r\nheterogeneous nature of white light, the black lines alternate with\r\nvivid stripes or fringes of prismatic colours, arising from the\r\nsuperposition of systems of alternate black lines and lines of each\r\nhomogeneous colour. That the alternation of black lines and coloured\r\nfringes actually does arise from the mixture of the two streams of light\r\nwhich flow round the wire, is proved by their vanishing the instant one\r\nof the streams is interrupted. It may therefore be concluded, as often\r\nas these stripes of light and darkness occur, that they are owing to the\r\nrays combining at certain intervals to produce a joint effect, and at\r\nothers to extinguish one another. Now it is contrary to all our ideas of\r\nmatter to suppose that two particles of it should annihilate one another\r\nunder any circumstances whatever; while, on the contrary, two opposing\r\nmotions may; and it is impossible not to be struck with the perfect\r\nsimilarity between the interferences of small undulations of air or of\r\nwater and the preceding phenomena. The analogy is indeed so perfect,\r\nthat philosophers of the highest authority concur in the belief that the\r\ncelestial regions are filled with an extremely rare and highly elastic\r\nmedium or ether, whose particles are capable of receiving the vibrations\r\ncommunicated to them by self-luminous bodies, and of transmitting them\r\nto the optic nerves, so as to produce the sensation of light. The\r\nacceleration in the mean motion of Encke’s comet, as well as of the\r\ncomet discovered by M. Biela, renders the existence of such a medium\r\ncertain. It is clear that, in this hypothesis, the alternate stripes of\r\nlight and darkness are entirely the effect of the interference of the\r\nundulations; for, by actual measurement, the length of a wave of the\r\nmean red rays of the solar spectrum is equal to the 0·0000258th part of\r\nan inch; consequently, when the elevations of the waves combine, they\r\nproduce double the intensity of light that each would do singly; and\r\nwhen half a wave combines with a whole—that is, when the hollow of one\r\nwave is filled up by the elevation of another—darkness is the result. At\r\nintermediate points between these extremes, the intensity of the light\r\ncorresponds to intermediate differences in the lengths of the rays.\r\n\r\nThe theory of interferences is a particular case of the general\r\nmechanical law of the superposition of small motions; whence it appears\r\nthat the disturbance of a particle of an elastic medium, produced by two\r\nco-existent undulations, is the sum of the disturbances which each\r\nundulation would produce separately; consequently, the particle will\r\nmove in the diagonal of a parallelogram, whose sides are the two\r\nundulations. If, therefore, the two undulations agree in direction, or\r\nnearly so, the resulting motion will be very nearly equal to their sum,\r\nand in the same direction; if they nearly oppose one another, the\r\nresulting motion will be nearly equal to their difference; and, if the\r\nundulations be equal and opposite, the resultant will be zero, and the\r\nparticle will remain at rest.\r\n\r\nThe preceding experiments, and the inferences deduced from them, which\r\nhave led to the establishment of the doctrine of the undulations of\r\nlight, are the most splendid memorials of our illustrious countryman Dr.\r\nThomas Young, though Huygens was the first to originate the idea.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that the particles of luminous bodies are in a state of\r\nperpetual agitation, and that they possess the property of exciting\r\nregular vibrations in the molecules of the ethereal medium,\r\ncorresponding to the vibrations of their own molecules; and that, on\r\naccount of its elastic nature, one particle of the ether when set in\r\nmotion communicates its vibrations to those adjacent, which in\r\nsuccession transmit them to those farther off; so that the primitive\r\nimpulse is transferred from particle to particle, and the undulating\r\nmotion darts through ether like a wave in water; so that light is\r\nmotion, and therefore subject to the laws of dynamics and mathematical\r\nanalysis. Although the progressive motion of light is known by\r\nexperience to be uniform and in a straight line, the vibrations of the\r\nparticles are always at right angles to the direction of the ray. The\r\npropagation of light is like the spreading of waves in water; but, if\r\none ray alone be considered, its motion may be conceived by supposing a\r\nrope of indefinite length stretched horizontally, one end of which is\r\nheld in the hand. If it be agitated to and fro at regular intervals,\r\nwith a motion perpendicular to its length, a series of similar and equal\r\ntremors or waves will be propagated along it; and if the regular\r\nimpulses be given in a variety of planes, as up and down, from right to\r\nleft, and also in oblique directions, the successive undulations will\r\ntake place in every possible plane. An analogous motion in the ether,\r\nwhen communicated to the optic nerves, would produce the sensation of\r\ncommon light. It is evident that the waves which flow from end to end of\r\nthe cord in a serpentine form are altogether different from the\r\nperpendicular vibratory motion of each particle of the rope, which never\r\ndeviates far from a state of rest. So, in ether, each particle vibrates\r\nperpendicularly to the direction of the ray; but these vibrations are\r\ntotally different from and independent of the undulations which are\r\ntransmitted through it, in the same manner as the vibrations of each\r\nparticular ear of corn are independent of the waves that rush from end\r\nto end of a harvest-field when agitated by the wind.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of light depends upon the amplitude or extent of the\r\nvibrations of the particles of ether, while its colour depends upon\r\ntheir frequency. The time of the vibration of a particle of ether is, by\r\ntheory, as the length of a wave directly, and inversely as its velocity.\r\nNow, as the velocity of light is known to be 190,000 miles in a second,\r\nif the lengths of the waves of the different coloured rays could be\r\nmeasured, the number of vibrations in a second corresponding to each\r\ncould be computed. That has been accomplished as follows:—All\r\ntransparent substances of a certain thickness, with parallel surfaces,\r\nreflect and transmit white light; but, if they be extremely thin, both\r\nthe reflected and transmitted light is coloured. The vivid hues on\r\nsoap-bubbles, the iridescent colours produced by heat on polished steel\r\nand copper, the fringes of colour between the laminæ of Iceland spar and\r\nsulphate of lime, all consist of a succession of hues disposed in the\r\nsame order, totally independent of the colour of the substance, and\r\ndetermined solely by its greater or less thickness—a circumstance which\r\naffords the means of ascertaining the length of the waves of each\r\ncoloured ray, and the frequency of the vibrations of the particles\r\nproducing them. If a plate of glass be laid upon a lens of almost\r\nimperceptible curvature, before an open window, when they are pressed\r\ntogether a black spot will be seen in the point of contact, surrounded\r\nby seven rings of vivid colours, all differing from one another\r\n(N. 199). In the first ring, estimated from the black spot, the colours\r\nsucceed each other in the following order:—black, very faint blue,\r\nbrilliant white, yellow, orange, and red. They are quite different in\r\nthe other rings, and in the seventh the only colours are pale bluish\r\ngreen and very pale pink. That these rings are formed between the two\r\nsurfaces in apparent contact may be proved by laying a prism on the lens\r\ninstead of the plate of glass, and viewing the rings through the\r\ninclined side of it that is next to the eye, which arrangement prevents\r\nthe light reflected from the upper surface mixing with that from the\r\nsurfaces in contact, so that the intervals between the rings appear\r\nperfectly black—one of the strongest circumstances in favour of the\r\nundulatory theory; for, although the phenomena of the rings can be\r\nexplained by either hypothesis, there is this material difference, that,\r\naccording to the undulatory theory, the intervals between the rings\r\nought to be absolutely black, which is confirmed by experiment; whereas,\r\nby the doctrine of emanation, they ought to be half illuminated, which\r\nis not found to be the case. M. Fresnel, whose opinion is of the first\r\nauthority, thought this test conclusive. It may therefore be concluded\r\nthat the rings arise entirely from the interference of the rays: the\r\nlight reflected from each of the surfaces in apparent contact reaches\r\nthe eye by paths of different lengths, and produces coloured and dark\r\nrings alternately, according as the reflected waves coincide or destroy\r\none another. The breadths of the rings are unequal; they decrease in\r\nwidth, and the colours become more crowded, as they recede from the\r\ncentre. Coloured rings are also produced by transmitting light through\r\nthe same apparatus; but the colours are less vivid, and are\r\ncomplementary to those reflected, consequently the central spot is\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nThe size of the rings increases with the obliquity of the incident\r\nlight, the same colour requiring a greater thickness or space between\r\nthe glasses to produce it than when the light falls perpendicularly upon\r\nthem. Now, if the apparatus be placed in homogeneous instead of white\r\nlight, the rings will all be of the same colour with that of the light\r\nemployed, that is to say, if the light be red, the rings will be red,\r\ndivided by black intervals. The size of the rings varies with the colour\r\nof the light. They are largest in red, and decrease in magnitude with\r\nthe succeeding prismatic colours, being smallest in violet light.\r\n\r\nSince one of the glasses is plane and the other spherical, it is evident\r\nthat from the point of contact the space between them gradually\r\nincreases in thickness all round, so that a certain thickness of air\r\ncorresponds to each colour, which in the undulatory system measures the\r\nlength of the wave producing it (N. 200). By actual measurement Sir\r\nIsaac Newton found that the squares of the diameters of the brightest\r\npart of each ring are as the odd numbers, 1, 3, 5, 7, &c.; and that the\r\nsquares of the diameters of the darkest parts are as the even numbers,\r\n0, 2, 4, 6, &c. Consequently, the intervals between the glasses at these\r\npoints are in the same proportion. If, then, the thickness of the air\r\ncorresponding to any one colour could be found, its thickness for all\r\nthe others would be known. Now, as Sir Isaac Newton knew the radius of\r\ncurvature of the lens, and the actual breadth of the rings in parts of\r\nan inch, it was easy to compute that the thickness of air at the darkest\r\npart of the first ring is the 1/89000 part of an inch, whence all the\r\nothers have been deduced. As these intervals determine the length of the\r\nwaves on the undulatory hypothesis, it appears that the length of a wave\r\nof the extreme red of the solar spectrum is equal to the 0·0000266th\r\npart of an inch; that the length of a wave of the extreme violet is\r\nequal to the 0·0000167th part of an inch; and, as the time of a\r\nvibration of a particle of ether producing any particular colour is\r\ndirectly as the length of a wave of that colour, and inversely as the\r\nvelocity of light, it follows that the molecules of ether producing the\r\nextreme red of the solar spectrum perform 458 millions of millions of\r\nvibrations in a second; and that those producing the extreme violet\r\naccomplish 727 millions of millions of vibrations in the same time. The\r\nlengths of the waves of the intermediate colours, and the number of\r\ntheir vibrations, being intermediate between these two, white light,\r\nwhich consists of all the colours, is consequently a mixture of waves of\r\nall lengths between the limits of the extreme red and violet. The\r\ndetermination of these minute portions of time and space, both of which\r\nhave a real existence, being the actual results of measurement, do as\r\nmuch honour to the genius of Newton as that of the law of gravitation.\r\n\r\nThe number of advancing waves of light in an inch is known to be from\r\n37,600 to 59,880, and the number of lateral vibrations is from 458 to\r\n727 billions in a second, but the _extent_ of these lateral vibrations\r\nof the particles of the ethereal medium is not known, though both their\r\nextent and velocity are probably very small compared with the length of\r\nthe advancing waves and the velocity of propagation. Colour is\r\nidentified with the number of vibrations; but whether reflection,\r\nrefraction, absorption, &c., have any relations to the lateral\r\nvibrations, or whether they are dependent in part upon some physical\r\naction of the ethereal medium unknown and unsuspected, are points as yet\r\nundetermined. To ascertain these circumstances, Dr. Faraday instituted a\r\nseries of the most refined experiments upon the relation of the minute\r\nparticles of metals to the vibrations of light.\r\n\r\nGold acts powerfully on light, and possesses a real transparency,\r\ntransmitting green rays when very thin; and being capable of extreme\r\ndivision by solvents without losing its metallic character, its\r\nparticles transmit rays of various colours according to their size;\r\nthose that transmit the rose-colour in Bohemian glass are of\r\ninconceivable minuteness. The progressive waves of the ether are so long\r\ncompared with the dimensions of the molecules to which gold can be\r\nreduced, that it seemed probable to Dr. Faraday when the latter were\r\nplaced in a sunbeam that some effective relation might be discovered\r\nbetween them and the smaller vibrations of the ethereal medium; in which\r\ncase, if reflection, refraction, &c., depended upon such relations,\r\nthere was reason to expect that these functions would change sensibly by\r\nthe substitution of different sized particles of the gold for one\r\nanother. At one time Dr. Faraday hoped he had changed one colour into\r\nanother by means of gold, which would have been equivalent to a change\r\nin the number of vibrations; but although he has not yet confirmed that\r\nresult, his researches are of the greatest interest.[9]\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of the coloured rings takes place _in vacuo_ as well as\r\nin air, which proves that it is the distance between the lenses alone,\r\nand not the air, which produces the colours. However, if water or oil be\r\nput between them, the rings contract, but no other change ensues; and\r\nNewton found that the thickness of different media at which a given tint\r\nis seen is in the inverse ratio of their refractive indices, so that the\r\nthickness of laminæ which could not otherwise be measured may be known\r\nby their colour; and, as the position of the colours in the rings is\r\ninvariable, they form a fixed standard of comparison, well known as\r\nNewton’s scale of colours; each tint being estimated according to the\r\nring to which it belongs from the central spot inclusively. Not only the\r\nperiodical colours which have been described, but the colours seen in\r\nthick plates of transparent substances, the variable hues of feathers,\r\nof insects’ wings, mother-of-pearl, and of striated substances, all\r\ndepend upon the same principle. To these may be added the coloured\r\nfringes surrounding the shadows of all bodies held in an extremely small\r\nbeam of light, and the coloured rings surrounding the small beam itself\r\nwhen received on a screen.\r\n\r\nWhen a very slender sunbeam, passing through a small pin-hole into a\r\ndark room, is received on a white screen, or plate of ground-glass, at\r\nthe distance of a little more than six feet, the spot of light on the\r\nscreen is larger than the pin-hole: and, instead of being bounded by\r\nshadow, it is surrounded by a series of coloured rings separated by\r\nobscure intervals. The rings are more distinct in proportion to the\r\nsmallness of the beam (N. 201). When the light is white there are seven\r\nrings, which dilate or contract with the distance of the screen from the\r\nhole. As the distance of the screen diminishes, the white central spot\r\ncontracts to a point and vanishes; and, on approaching still nearer, the\r\nrings gradually close in upon it, so that the centre assumes\r\nsuccessively the most intense and vivid hues. When the light is\r\nhomogeneous—red, for example—the rings are alternately red and black,\r\nand more numerous; and their breadth varies with the colour, being\r\nbroadest in red light and narrowest in violet. The tints of the coloured\r\nfringes from white light, and their obliteration after the seventh ring,\r\narise from the superposition of the different sets of fringes of all the\r\ncoloured rays. The shadows of objects are also bordered by coloured\r\nfringes when held in this slender beam of light. If the edge of a knife\r\nor hair, for example, be held in it, the rays, instead of proceeding in\r\nstraight lines past its edge, are bent when quite close to it, and\r\nproceed from thence to the screen in curved lines called hyperbolas; so\r\nthat the shadow of the object is enlarged, and, instead of being at once\r\nbounded by light, is surrounded or edged with coloured fringes\r\nalternating with black bands, which are more distinct the smaller the\r\npin-hole (N. 202). The fringes are altogether independent of the form or\r\ndensity of the object, being the same when it is round or pointed, when\r\nof glass or platinum. When the rays which form the fringes arrive at the\r\nscreen, they are of different lengths, in consequence of the curved path\r\nthey follow after passing the edge of the object. The waves are\r\ntherefore in different phases or states of vibration, and either\r\nconspire to form coloured fringes or destroy one another in the obscure\r\nintervals. The coloured fringes bordering the shadows of objects were\r\nfirst described by Grimaldi in 1665; but, besides these, he noticed that\r\nthere are others within the shadows of slender bodies exposed to a small\r\nsunbeam, a phenomenon which has already been mentioned to have afforded\r\nDr. Young the means of proving, beyond all controversy, that coloured\r\nrings are produced by the interference of light.\r\n\r\nIt may be concluded that material substances derive their colours from\r\ntwo different causes: some from the law of interference, such as\r\niridescent metals, peacocks’ feathers, &c.; others from the unequal\r\nabsorption of the rays of white light, such as vermilion, ultramarine,\r\nblue, or green cloth, flowers, and the greater number of coloured\r\nbodies. The latter phenomena have been considered extremely difficult to\r\nreconcile with the undulatory theory of light, and much discussion has\r\narisen as to what becomes of the absorbed rays. But that embarrassing\r\nquestion has been ably answered by Sir John Herschel in a most profound\r\npaper on the Absorption of Light by coloured Media, and cannot be better\r\ngiven than in his own words. It must, however, be premised, that, as all\r\ntransparent bodies are traversed by light, they are presumed to be\r\npermeable to the ether. He says,—“Now, as regards only the general fact\r\nof the obstruction and ultimate extinction of light in its passage\r\nthrough gross media, if we compare the corpuscular and undulatory\r\ntheories, we shall find that the former appeals to our ignorance, the\r\nlatter to our knowledge, for its explanation of the absorptive\r\nphenomena. In attempting to explain the extinction of light on the\r\ncorpuscular doctrine, we have to account for the light so extinguished\r\nas a material body, which we must not suppose annihilated. It may,\r\nhowever, be transformed; and among the imponderable agents, heat,\r\nelectricity, &c., it may be that we are to search for the light which\r\nhas become thus comparatively stagnant. The heating power of the solar\r\nrays gives a _primâ facie_ plausibility to the idea of the\r\ntransformation of light into heat by absorption. But, when we come to\r\nexamine the matter more nearly, we find it encumbered on all sides with\r\ndifficulties. How is it, for instance, that the most luminous rays are\r\nnot the most calorific, but that, on the contrary, the calorific energy\r\naccompanies, in its greatest intensity, rays which possess comparatively\r\nfeeble illuminating powers? These and other questions of a similar\r\nnature may perhaps admit of answer in a more advanced state of our\r\nknowledge; but at present there is none obvious. It is not without\r\nreason, therefore, that the question, ‘What becomes of light?’ which\r\nappears to have been agitated among the photologists of the last\r\ncentury, has been regarded as one of considerable importance as well as\r\nobscurity by the corpuscular philosophers. On the other hand, the answer\r\nto this question, afforded by the undulatory theory of light, is simple\r\nand distinct. The question, ‘What becomes of light?’ merges in the more\r\ngeneral one, ‘What becomes of motion?’ And the answer, on dynamical\r\nprinciples, is, that it continues for ever. No motion is, strictly\r\nspeaking, annihilated; but it may be divided, and the divided parts made\r\nto oppose and _in effect_ destroy one another. A body struck, however\r\nperfectly elastic, vibrates for a time, and then appears to sink into\r\nits original repose. But this apparent rest (even abstracting from the\r\ninquiry that part of the motion which may be conveyed away by the\r\nambient air) is nothing else than a state of subdivided and mutually\r\ndestroying motion, in which every molecule continues to be agitated by\r\nan indefinite multitude of internally reflected waves, propagated\r\nthrough it in every possible direction, from every point in its surface\r\non which they successively impinge. The superposition of such waves\r\nwill, it is easily seen, at length operate their mutual destruction,\r\nwhich will be the more complete the more irregular the figure of the\r\nbody, and the greater the number of internal reflections.” Thus Sir John\r\nHerschel, by referring the absorption of light to the subdivision and\r\nmutual destruction of the vibrations of ether in the interior of bodies,\r\nbrings another class of phenomena under the laws of the undulatory\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Rankin’s hypothesis of Molecular Vortices[10] the\r\nabsorption of light and radiant heat consists in the transference of\r\nmotion from the molecules to their atmospheres, and conversely the\r\nemission of light and radiant heat is the transmission of motion from\r\nthe atmospheres to the molecules. The great velocity of light and heat\r\nis a natural consequence of this hypothesis, according to which the\r\nvibratory masses must be extremely small compared with the forces\r\nexerted by them.\r\n\r\nThe ethereal medium pervading space is supposed to penetrate all\r\nmaterial substances, occupying the interstices between their molecules;\r\nbut in the interior of refracting media it exists in a state of less\r\nelasticity compared with its density _in vacuo_; and, the more\r\nrefractive the medium, the less the elasticity of the ether within it.\r\nHence the waves of light are transmitted with less velocity in such\r\nmedia as glass and water than in the external ether. As soon as a ray of\r\nlight reaches the surface of a diaphanous reflecting substance, for\r\nexample a plate of glass, it communicates its undulations to the ether\r\nnext in contact with the surface, which thus becomes a new centre of\r\nmotion, and two hemispherical waves are propagated from each point of\r\nthis surface; one of which proceeds forward into the interior of the\r\nglass, with a less velocity than the incident waves; and the other is\r\ntransmitted back into the air, with a velocity equal to that with which\r\nit came (N. 203). Thus, when refracted, the light moves with a different\r\nvelocity without and within the glass; when reflected, the ray comes and\r\ngoes with the same velocity. The particles of ether without the glass,\r\nwhich communicate their motions to the particles of the dense and less\r\nelastic ether within it, are analogous to small elastic balls striking\r\nlarge ones; for some of the motion will be communicated to the large\r\nballs, and the small ones will be reflected. The first would cause the\r\nrefracted wave, and the last the reflected. Conversely, when the light\r\npasses from glass to air, the action is similar to large balls striking\r\nsmall ones. The small balls receive a motion which would cause the\r\nrefracted ray, and the part of the motion retained by the large ones\r\nwould occasion the reflected wave; so that, when light passes through a\r\nplate of glass or of any other medium differing in density from the air,\r\nthere is a reflection at both surfaces; but this difference exists\r\nbetween the two reflections, that one is caused by a vibration in the\r\nsame direction with that of the incident ray, and the other by a\r\nvibration in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nA single wave of air or ether would not produce the sensation of sound\r\nor light. In order to excite vision, the vibrations of the molecules of\r\nether must be regular, periodical, and very often repeated: and, as the\r\near continues to be agitated for a short time after the impulse by which\r\nalone a sound becomes continuous, so also the fibres of the retina,\r\naccording to M. d’Arcet, continue to vibrate for about the eighth part\r\nof a second after the exciting cause has ceased. The interval of time\r\nduring which the impression lasts is longer for the blue than for red or\r\nwhite light: it must not be less than 0ʺ·34. Every one must have\r\nobserved, when a strong impression is made by a bright light, that an\r\nobject remains visible for a short time after shutting the eyes, which\r\nis supposed to be in consequence of the continued vibrations of the\r\nfibres of the retina. Occasionally the retina becomes insensible to\r\nfeebly illuminated objects when continuously presented. If the eye be\r\nturned aside for a moment, the object becomes again visible. It is\r\nprobably on this account that the owl makes so peculiar a motion with\r\nits head when looking at objects in the twilight. It is quite possible\r\nthat many vibrations may be excited in the ethereal medium incapable of\r\nproducing undulations in the fibres of the human retina, which yet have\r\na powerful effect on those of other animals or of insects. Such may\r\nreceive luminous impressions of which we are totally unconscious, and at\r\nthe same time they may be insensible to the light and colours which\r\naffect our eyes, their perceptions beginning where ours end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION XXI.\r\n\r\nPolarization of Light—Defined—Polarization by Refraction—Properties of\r\n  the Tourmaline—Double Refraction—All doubly Refracted Light is\r\n  Polarized—Properties of Iceland Spar—Tourmaline absorbs one of the two\r\n  Refracted Rays—Undulations of Natural Light—Undulations of Polarized\r\n  Light—The Optic Axes of Crystals—M. Fresnel’s Discoveries on the Rays\r\n  passing along the Optic Axis—Polarization by Reflection.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN giving a sketch of the constitution of light, it is impossible to\r\nomit the extraordinary property of its polarization, “the phenomena of\r\nwhich,” Sir John Herschel says, “are so singular and various, that to\r\none who has only studied the common branches of physical optics it is\r\nlike entering into a new world, so splendid as to render it one of the\r\nmost delightful branches of experimental inquiry, and so fertile in the\r\nviews it lays open of the constitution of natural bodies, and the\r\nminuter mechanism of the universe, as to place it in the very first rank\r\nof the physico-mathematical sciences, which it maintains by the rigorous\r\napplication of geometrical reasoning its nature admits and requires.”\r\n\r\nLight is said to be polarized, which, by being once reflected or\r\nrefracted, is rendered incapable of being again reflected or refracted\r\nat certain angles. In general, when a ray of light is reflected from a\r\npane of plate-glass, or any other substance, it may be reflected a\r\nsecond time from another surface, and it will also pass freely through\r\ntransparent bodies. But, if a ray of light be reflected from a pane of\r\nplate-glass at an angle of 57°, it is rendered totally incapable of\r\nreflection at the surface of another pane of glass in certain definite\r\npositions, but it will be completely reflected by the second pane in\r\nother positions. It likewise loses the property of penetrating\r\ntransparent bodies in particular positions, whilst it is freely\r\ntransmitted by them in others. Light, so modified as to be incapable of\r\nreflection and transmission in certain directions, is said to be\r\npolarized.\r\n\r\nLight may be polarized by reflection from any polished surface, and the\r\nsame property is also imparted by refraction. It is proposed to explain\r\nthese methods of polarizing light, to give a short account of its most\r\nremarkable properties, and to endeavour to describe a few of the\r\nsplendid phenomena it exhibits.\r\n\r\nIf a brown tourmaline, which is a mineral generally crystallized in the\r\nform of a long prism, be cut longitudinally, that is, parallel to the\r\naxis of the prism, into plates about the thirtieth of an inch in\r\nthickness, and the surfaces polished, luminous objects may be seen\r\nthrough them, as through plates of coloured glass. The axis of each\r\nplate is in its longitudinal section parallel to the axis of the prism\r\nwhence it was cut (N. 204). If one of these plates be held\r\nperpendicularly between the eye and a candle, and turned slowly round in\r\nits own plane, no change will take place in the image of the candle. But\r\nif the plate be held in a fixed position, with its axis or longitudinal\r\nsection vertical, when a second plate of tourmaline is interposed\r\nbetween it and the eye, parallel to the first, and turned slowly round\r\nin its own plane, a remarkable change will be found to have taken place\r\nin the nature of the light. For the image of the candle will vanish and\r\nappear alternately at every quarter revolution of the plate, varying\r\nthrough all degrees of brightness down to total or almost total\r\nevanescence, and then increasing again by the same degrees as it had\r\nbefore decreased. These changes depend upon the relative positions of\r\nthe plates. When the longitudinal sections of the two plates are\r\nparallel, the brightness of the image is at its maximum; and, when the\r\naxes of the sections cross at right angles, the image of the candle\r\nvanishes. Thus the light, in passing through the first plate of\r\ntourmaline, has acquired a property totally different from the direct\r\nlight of the candle. The direct light would have penetrated the second\r\nplate equally well in all directions, whereas the refracted ray will\r\nonly pass through it in particular positions, and is altogether\r\nincapable of penetrating it in others. The refracted ray is polarized in\r\nits passage through the first tourmaline, and experience shows that it\r\nnever loses that property, unless when acted upon by a new substance.\r\nThus, one of the properties of polarized light is the incapability of\r\npassing through a plate of tourmaline perpendicular to it, in certain\r\npositions, and its ready transmission in other positions at right angles\r\nto the former.\r\n\r\nMany other substances have the property of polarizing light. If a ray of\r\nlight falls upon a transparent medium, which has the same temperature,\r\ndensity, and structure throughout every part, as fluids, gases, glass,\r\n&c., and a few regularly crystallized minerals, it is refracted into a\r\nsingle pencil of light by the laws of ordinary refraction, according to\r\nwhich the ray, passing through the refracting surface from the object to\r\nthe eye, never quits a plane perpendicular to that surface. Almost all\r\nother bodies, such as the greater number of crystallized minerals,\r\nanimal and vegetable substances, gums, resins, jellies, and all solid\r\nbodies having unequal tensions, whether from unequal temperature or\r\npressure, possess the property of doubling the image or appearance of an\r\nobject seen through them in certain directions; because a ray of natural\r\nlight falling upon them is refracted into two pencils which move with\r\ndifferent velocities, and are more or less separated, according to the\r\nnature of the body and the direction of the incident ray. Whenever a ray\r\nof natural light is thus divided into two pencils in its passage through\r\na substance, both of the transmitted rays are polarized. Iceland spar, a\r\ncarbonate of lime, which by its natural cleavage may be split into the\r\nform of a rhombohedron, possesses the property of double refraction in\r\nan eminent degree, as may be seen by pasting a piece of paper, with a\r\nlarge pin-hole in it, on the side of the spar farthest from the eye. The\r\nhole will appear double when held to the light (N. 205). One of these\r\npencils is refracted according to the same law as in glass or water,\r\nnever quitting the plane perpendicular to the refracting surface, and is\r\ntherefore called the ordinary ray. But the other does quit the plane,\r\nbeing refracted according to a different and much more complicated law,\r\nand on that account is called the extraordinary ray. For the same reason\r\none image is called the ordinary, and the other the extraordinary image.\r\nWhen the spar is turned round in the same plane, the extraordinary image\r\nof the hole revolves about the ordinary image, which remains fixed, both\r\nbeing equally bright. But if the spar be kept in one position, and\r\nviewed through a plate of tourmaline, it will be found that, as the\r\ntourmaline revolves, the images vary in their relative brightness—one\r\nincreases in intensity till it arrives at a maximum, at the same time\r\nthat the other diminishes till it vanishes, and so on alternately at\r\neach quarter revolution, proving both rays to be polarized. For in one\r\nposition the tourmaline transmits the ordinary ray, and reflects the\r\nextraordinary; and, after revolving 90°, the extraordinary ray is\r\ntransmitted, and the ordinary ray is reflected. Thus another property of\r\npolarized light is, that it cannot be divided into two equal pencils by\r\ndouble refraction, in positions of the doubly refracting bodies in which\r\na ray of common light would be so divided.\r\n\r\nWere tourmaline like other doubly refracting bodies, each of the\r\ntransmitted rays would be double; but that mineral, when of a certain\r\nthickness, after separating the light into two polarized pencils,\r\nabsorbs that which undergoes ordinary refraction, and consequently shows\r\nonly one image of an object. On this account tourmaline is peculiarly\r\nfitted for analyzing polarized light, which shows nothing remarkable\r\ntill viewed through it or something equivalent.\r\n\r\nThe pencils of light, on leaving a double refracting substance, are\r\nparallel; and it is clear, from the preceding experiments, that they are\r\npolarized in planes at right angles to each other (N. 206). But that\r\nwill be better understood by considering the change produced in common\r\nlight by the action of the polarizing body. It has been shown that the\r\nundulations of ether, which produce the sensation of common light, are\r\nperformed in every possible plane, at right angles to the direction in\r\nwhich the ray is moving. But the case is very different after the ray\r\nhas passed through a doubly refracting substance, like Iceland spar. The\r\nlight then proceeds in two parallel pencils, whose undulations are still\r\nindeed transverse to the direction of the rays, but they are\r\naccomplished in planes at right angles to one another, analogous to two\r\nparallel stretched cords, one of which performs its undulations only in\r\na horizontal plane, and the other in a vertical or upright plane\r\n(N. 206). Thus the polarizing action of Iceland spar and of all doubly\r\nrefracting substances is to separate a ray of common light, whose waves\r\nor undulations are in every plane, into two parallel rays, whose waves\r\nor undulations lie in planes at right angles to each other. By a simple\r\nmechanical law each vibratory motion of the first is resolved into two\r\nvibratory motions at right angles to one another. The ray of common\r\nlight may be assimilated to a round rod, whereas the two polarized rays\r\nare like two parallel long flat rulers, one of which is laid\r\nhorizontally on its broad surface, and the other horizontally on its\r\nedge. The alternate transmission and obstruction of one of these\r\nflattened beams by the tourmaline is similar to the facility with which\r\na card may be passed between the bars of a grating or wires of a cage,\r\nif presented edgeways, and the impossibility of its passing in a\r\ntransverse direction.\r\n\r\nAlthough it generally happens that a ray of light, in passing through\r\nIceland spar, is separated into two polarized rays, yet there is one\r\ndirection along which it is refracted in one ray only, and that\r\naccording to the ordinary law. This direction is called the optic axis\r\n(N. 207). Many crystals and other substances have two optic axes,\r\ninclined to each other, along which a ray of light is transmitted in one\r\npencil by the law of ordinary refraction. The extraordinary ray is\r\nsometimes refracted towards the optic axis, as in quartz, zircon, ice,\r\n&c., which are therefore said to be positive crystals; but when it is\r\nbent from the optic axis, as in Iceland spar, tourmaline, emerald,\r\nberyl, &c., the crystals are negative, which is the most numerous class.\r\nThe ordinary ray moves with uniform velocity within a doubly refracting\r\nsubstance, but the velocity of the extraordinary ray varies with the\r\nposition of the ray relatively to the optic axis, being a maximum when\r\nits motion within the crystal is at right angles to the optic axis, and\r\na minimum when parallel to it. Between these extremes its velocity\r\nvaries according to a determinate law.\r\n\r\nIt had been inferred, from the action of Iceland spar on light, that in\r\nall doubly refracting substances one only of two rays is turned aside\r\nfrom the plane of ordinary refraction, while the other follows the\r\nordinary law; and the great difficulty of observing the phenomena tended\r\nto confirm that opinion. M. Fresnel, however, proved by a most profound\r\nmathematical inquiry, _à priori_, that the extraordinary ray must be\r\nwanting in glass and other uncrystallized substances, and that it must\r\nnecessarily exist in carbonate of lime, quartz, and other bodies having\r\none optic axis, but that in a numerous class of substances, which\r\npossess two optic axes, both rays must undergo extraordinary refraction,\r\nand consequently that both must deviate from their original plane; and\r\nthese results have been perfectly confirmed by subsequent experiments.\r\nThis theory of refraction, which for generalization is perhaps only\r\ninferior to the law of gravitation, has enrolled the name of Fresnel\r\namong those which pass not away, and makes his early loss a subject of\r\ndeep regret to all who take an interest in the higher paths of\r\nscientific research.\r\n\r\nWhen a beam of common light is partly reflected at, and partly\r\ntransmitted through a transparent surface, the reflected and refracted\r\npencils contain equal quantities of polarized light, and their planes of\r\npolarization are at right angles to one another: hence, a pile of panes\r\nof glass will give a polarized beam by refraction. For, if a ray of\r\ncommon light pass through them, part of it will be polarized by the\r\nfirst plate, the second plate will polarize a part of what passes\r\nthrough it, and the rest will do the same in succession, till the whole\r\nbeam is polarized, except what is lost by reflection at the different\r\nsurfaces, or by absorption. This beam is polarized in a plane at right\r\nangles to the plane of reflection, that is, at right angles to the plane\r\npassing through the incident and reflected ray (N. 208).\r\n\r\nBy far the most convenient way of polarizing light is by reflection. A\r\nplane of plate-glass laid upon a piece of black cloth, on a table at an\r\nopen window, will appear of a uniform brightness from the reflection of\r\nthe sky or clouds. But if it be viewed through a plate of tourmaline,\r\nhaving its axis vertical, instead of being illuminated as before, it\r\nwill be obscured by a large cloudy spot, having its centre quite dark,\r\nwhich will readily be found by elevating or depressing the eye, and will\r\nonly be visible when the angle of incidence is 57°, that is, when the\r\nline from the eye to the centre of the black spot makes an angle of 33°\r\nwith the surface of the reflector (N. 209). When the tourmaline is\r\nturned round in its own plane, the dark cloud will diminish, and\r\nentirely vanish when the axis of the tourmaline is horizontal, and then\r\nevery part of the surface of the glass will be equally illuminated. As\r\nthe tourmaline revolves, the cloudy spot will appear and vanish\r\nalternately at every quarter revolution. Thus, when a ray of light is\r\nincident on a pane of plate-glass at an angle of 57°, the reflected ray\r\nis rendered incapable of penetrating a plate of tourmaline whose axis is\r\nin the plane of incidence. Consequently it has acquired the same\r\ncharacter as if it had been polarized by transmission through a plate of\r\ntourmaline, with its axis at right angles to the plane of reflection. It\r\nis found by experience that this polarized ray is incapable of a second\r\nreflection at certain angles and in certain positions of the incident\r\nplane. For if another pane of plate-glass, having one surface blackened,\r\nbe so placed as to make an angle of 33° with the reflected ray, the\r\nimage of the first pane will be reflected in its surface, and will be\r\nalternately illuminated and obscured at every quarter revolution of the\r\nblackened pane, according as the plane of reflection is parallel or\r\nperpendicular to the plane of polarization. Since this happens by\r\nwhatever means the light has been polarized, it evinces another general\r\nproperty of polarized light, which is, that it is incapable of\r\nreflection in a plane at right angles to the plane of polarization.\r\n\r\nAll reflecting surfaces are capable of polarizing light, but the angle\r\nof incidence at which it is completely polarized is different in each\r\nsubstance (N. 210). It appears that the angle for plate-glass is 57°; in\r\ncrown-glass it is 56° 55ʹ, and no ray will be completely polarized by\r\nwater unless the angle of incidence be 53° 11ʹ. The angles at which\r\ndifferent substances polarize light are determined by a very simple and\r\nelegant law, discovered by Sir David Brewster, “That the tangent of the\r\npolarizing angle for any medium is equal to the sine of the angle of\r\nincidence divided by the sine of the angle of refraction of that\r\nmedium.” Whence also the refractive power even of an opaque body is\r\nknown when its polarizing angle has been determined.\r\n\r\nIf a ray, polarized by refraction or by reflection from any substance\r\nnot metallic, be viewed through a piece of Iceland spar, each image will\r\nalternately vanish and reappear at every quarter revolution of the spar,\r\nwhether it revolves from right to left or from left to right; which\r\nshows that the properties of the polarized ray are symmetrical on each\r\nside of the plane of polarization.\r\n\r\nAlthough there be only one angle in each substance at which light is\r\ncompletely polarized by one reflection, yet it may be polarized at any\r\nangle of incidence by a sufficient number of reflections. For, if a ray\r\nfalls upon the upper surface of a pile of plates of glass at an angle\r\ngreater or less than a polarizing angle, a part only of the reflected\r\nray will be polarized, but a part of what is transmitted will be\r\npolarized by reflection at the surface of the second plate, part at the\r\nthird, and so on till the whole is polarized. This is the best\r\napparatus; but one plate of glass having its inferior surface blackened,\r\nor even a polished table, will answer the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION XXII.\r\n\r\nPhenomena exhibited by the Passage of Polarized Light through Mica and\r\n  Sulphate of Lime—The Coloured Images produced by Polarized Light\r\n  passing through Crystals having one and two Optic Axes—Circular\r\n  Polarization—Elliptical Polarization—Discoveries of MM. Biot, Fresnel,\r\n  and Professor Airy—Coloured Images produced by the Interference of\r\n  Polarized Rays—Fluorescence.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCH is the nature of polarized light and of the laws it follows. But it\r\nis hardly possible to convey an idea of the splendour of the phenomena\r\nit exhibits under circumstances which an attempt will now be made to\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\nIf light polarized by reflection from a pane of glass be viewed through\r\na plate of tourmaline, with its longitudinal section vertical, an\r\nobscure cloud, with its centre totally dark, will be seen on the glass.\r\nNow, let a plate of mica, uniformly about the thirtieth of an inch in\r\nthickness, be interposed between the tourmaline and the glass; the dark\r\nspot will instantly vanish, and, instead of it, a succession of the most\r\ngorgeous colours will appear, varying with every inclination of the\r\nmica, from the richest reds, to the most vivid greens, blues, and\r\npurples (N. 211). That they may be seen in perfection, the mica must\r\nrevolve at right angles to its own plane. When the mica is turned round\r\nin a plane perpendicular to the polarized ray, it will be found that\r\nthere are two lines in it where the colours entirely vanish. These are\r\nthe optic axes of the mica, which is a doubly refracting substance, with\r\ntwo optic axes, along which light is refracted in one pencil.\r\n\r\nNo colours are visible in the mica, whatever its position may be with\r\nregard to the polarized light, without the aid of the tourmaline, which\r\nseparates the transmitted ray into two pencils of coloured light\r\ncomplementary to one another, that is, which taken together would make\r\nwhite light. One of these it absorbs, and transmits the other; it is\r\ntherefore called the analyzing plate. The truth of this will appear more\r\nreadily if a film of sulphate of lime, between the twentieth and\r\nsixtieth of an inch thick, be used instead of the mica. When the film is\r\nof uniform thickness, only one colour will be seen when it is placed\r\nbetween the analyzing plate and the reflecting glass; as, for example,\r\nred. But, when the tourmaline revolves, the red will vanish by degrees\r\ntill the film is colourless; then it will assume a green hue, which will\r\nincrease and arrive at its maximum when the tourmaline has turned\r\nthrough ninety degrees; after that, the green will vanish and the red\r\nwill reappear, alternating at each quadrant. Thus the tourmaline\r\nseparates the light which has passed through the film into a red and a\r\ngreen pencil; in one position it absorbs the green and lets the red\r\npass, and in another it absorbs the red and transmits the green. This is\r\nproved by analyzing the ray with Iceland spar instead of tourmaline;\r\nfor, since the spar does not absorb the light, two images of the\r\nsulphate of lime will be seen, one red and the other green; and these\r\nexchange colours every quarter revolution of the spar, the red becoming\r\ngreen, and the green red; and, where the images overlap, the colour is\r\nwhite, proving the red and green to be complementary to each other. The\r\ntint depends on the thickness of the film. Films of sulphate of lime,\r\nthe 0·00124 and 0·01818 of an inch respectively, give white light in\r\nwhatever position they may be held, provided they be perpendicular to\r\nthe polarized ray; but films of intermediate thickness will give all\r\ncolours. Consequently, a wedge of sulphate of lime, varying in thickness\r\nbetween the 0·00124 and the 0·01818 of an inch, will appear to be\r\nstriped with all colours when polarized light is transmitted through it.\r\nA change in the inclination of the film, whether of mica or sulphate of\r\nlime, is evidently equivalent to a variation in thickness.\r\n\r\nWhen a plate of mica, held as close to the eye as possible, at such an\r\ninclination as to transmit the polarized ray along one of its optic\r\naxes, is viewed through the tourmaline with its axis vertical, a most\r\nsplendid appearance is presented. The cloudy spot in the direction of\r\nthe optic axis is seen surrounded by a set of vividly coloured rings of\r\nan oval form, divided into two unequal parts by a black curved band\r\npassing through the cloudy spot about which the rings are formed. The\r\nother optic axis of the mica exhibits a similar image (N. 212).\r\n\r\nWhen the two optic axes of a crystal make a small angle with one\r\nanother, as in nitre, the two sets of rings touch externally; and, if\r\nthe plate of nitre be turned round in its own plane, the black\r\ntransverse bands undergo a variety of changes, till, at last, the whole\r\nrichly coloured image assumes the form of the figure 8, traversed by a\r\nblack cross (N. 213). Substances with one optic axis have but one set of\r\ncoloured circular rings, with a broad black cross passing through its\r\ncentre, dividing the rings into four equal parts. When the analyzing\r\nplate revolves, this figure recurs at every quarter revolution; but in\r\nthe intermediate positions it assumes the complementary colours, the\r\nblack cross becoming white.\r\n\r\nIt is in vain to attempt to describe the beautiful phenomena exhibited\r\nby innumerable bodies which undergo periodic changes in form and colour\r\nwhen the analyzing plate revolves, but not one of them shows a trace of\r\ncolour without the aid of tourmaline, or something equivalent, to\r\nanalyze the light, and as it were to call these beautiful phantoms into\r\nexistence. Tourmaline has the disadvantage of being itself a coloured\r\nsubstance; but that inconvenience may be obviated by employing a\r\nreflecting surface as an analyzing plate. When polarized light is\r\nreflected by a plate of glass at the polarizing angle, it will be\r\nseparated into two coloured pencils; and, when the analyzing plate is\r\nturned round in its own plane, it will alternately reflect each ray at\r\nevery quarter revolution, so that all the phenomena that have been\r\ndescribed will be seen by reflection on its surface.\r\n\r\nColoured rings are produced by analyzing polarized light transmitted\r\nthrough glass melted and suddenly or unequally cooled; also through thin\r\nplates of glass bent with the hand, jelly indurated or compressed, &c.\r\n&c. In short, all the phenomena of coloured rings may be produced,\r\neither permanently or transiently, in a variety of substances, by heat\r\nand cold, rapid cooling, compression, dilatation, and induration; and so\r\nlittle apparatus is necessary for performing the experiments, that, as\r\nSir John Herschel says, a piece of window glass or a polished table to\r\npolarize the light, a sheet of clear ice to produce the rings, and a\r\nbroken fragment of plate-glass placed near the eye to analyze the light,\r\nare alone requisite to produce one of the most splendid of optical\r\nexhibitions.\r\n\r\nPressure produces remarkable changes in the optical properties of\r\ncrystals. Compression, perpendicular to the axis, transforms a crystal\r\nwith one optic axis into one with two. A slice of quartz and one of\r\nberyl, both cut perpendicularly to their axis, were compressed thus by\r\nMM. Moignot and Soleil. They found that the single system in the quartz,\r\nwhich is a positive crystal, was doubled in the direction of the\r\ncompression, while in the beryl, which is a negative crystal, the\r\nduplication was perpendicular to the compression. In the quartz the axis\r\nof the double system coincided with the line of pressure, but in the\r\ntourmaline, which is a negative crystal, the line which joins the\r\ncentres of the rings was perpendicular to the pressure.\r\n\r\nIf a positive crystal be compressed in the direction of its axis the\r\ntint of the rings descends, and that of a negative crystal rises. But if\r\nthe crystals be dilated in the direction of their optic axis, the tints\r\nin positive crystals rise, and negative descend.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed, that when a ray of light, polarized by reflection\r\nfrom any surface not metallic, is analyzed by a doubly refracting\r\nsubstance, it exhibits properties which are symmetrical both to the\r\nright and left of the plane of reflection, and the ray is then said to\r\nbe polarized according to that plane. This symmetry is not destroyed\r\nwhen the ray, before being analyzed, traverses the optic axis of a\r\ncrystal having but one optic axis, as evidently appears from the\r\ncircular forms of the coloured rings already described. Regularly\r\ncrystallized quartz, however, forms an exception. In it, even though the\r\nrays should pass through the optic axis itself, where there is no double\r\nrefraction, the primitive symmetry of the ray is destroyed, and the\r\nplane of primitive polarization deviates either to the right or left of\r\nthe observer, by an angle proportional to the thickness of the plate of\r\nquartz. This angular motion, or true rotation of the plane of\r\npolarization, which is called circular polarization, is clearly proved\r\nby the phenomena. The coloured rings produced by all crystals having but\r\none optic axis are circular, and traversed by a black cross concentric\r\nwith the rings; so that the light entirely vanishes throughout the space\r\nenclosed by the interior ring, because there is neither double\r\nrefraction nor polarization along the optic axis. But in the system of\r\nrings produced by a plate of quartz, whose surfaces are perpendicular to\r\nthe axis of the crystal, the part within the interior ring, instead of\r\nbeing void of light, is occupied by a uniform tint of red, green, or\r\nblue, according to the thickness of the plate (N. 214). Suppose the\r\nplate of quartz to be 1/25 of an inch thick, which will give the red\r\ntint to the space within the interior ring; when the analyzing plate is\r\nturned, in its own plane through an angle of 17-1/2°, the red hue\r\nvanishes. If a plate of rock crystal 2/25 of an inch thick be used, the\r\nanalyzing plate must revolve through 35° before the red tint vanishes,\r\nand so on, every additional 25th of an inch in thickness requiring an\r\nadditional rotation of 17-1/2°; whence it is manifest that the plane of\r\npolarization revolves in the direction of a spiral within the rock\r\ncrystal. It is remarkable that, in some crystals of quartz, the plane of\r\npolarization revolves from right to left, and in others from left to\r\nright, although the crystals themselves differ apparently only by a very\r\nslight, almost imperceptible, variety in form. In these phenomena the\r\nrotation to the right is accomplished according to the same laws, and\r\nwith the same energy, as that to the left. But if two plates of quartz\r\nbe interposed, which possess different affections, the second plate\r\nundoes, either wholly or partly, the rotatory motion which the first had\r\nproduced, according as the plates are of equal or unequal thickness.\r\nWhen the plates are of unequal thickness, the deviation is in the\r\ndirection of the strongest, and exactly the same with that which a third\r\nplate would produce equal in thickness to the difference of the two.\r\n\r\nM. Biot has discovered the same properties in a variety of liquids. Oil\r\nof turpentine, and an essential oil of laurel, cause the plane of\r\npolarization to turn to the left, whereas the syrup of sugar-cane, and a\r\nsolution of natural camphor, by alcohol, turn it to the right. A\r\ncompensation is effected by the superposition or mixture of two liquids\r\nwhich possess these opposite properties, provided no chemical action\r\ntakes place. A remarkable difference was also observed by M. Biot\r\nbetween the action of the particles of the same substances when in a\r\nliquid or solid state. The syrup of grapes, for example, turns the plane\r\nof polarization to the left as long as it remains liquid; but, as soon\r\nas it acquires the solid form of sugar, it causes the plane of\r\npolarization to revolve towards the right, a property which it retains\r\neven when again dissolved. Instances occur also in which these\r\ncircumstances are reversed.\r\n\r\nA ray of light passing through a liquid possessing the power of circular\r\npolarization is not affected by mixing other fluids with the liquid—such\r\nas water, ether, alcohol, &c.—which do not possess circular polarization\r\nthemselves, the angle of deviation remaining exactly the same as before\r\nthe mixture. Whence M. Biot infers that the action exercised by the\r\nliquids in question does not depend upon their mass, but that it is a\r\nmolecular action exercised by the ultimate particles of matter, which\r\ndepends solely upon the individual constitution, and is entirely\r\nindependent of the positions and mutual distances of the particles with\r\nregard to each other. These important discoveries show that circular\r\npolarization surpasses the power of chemical analysis in giving certain\r\nand direct evidence of the similarity or difference existing in the\r\nmolecular constitution of bodies, as well as of the permanency of that\r\nconstitution, or of the fluctuations to which it may be liable. For\r\nexample, no chemical difference has been discovered between syrup from\r\nthe sugar-cane and syrup from grapes. Yet the first causes the plane of\r\npolarization to revolve to the right, and the other to the left;\r\ntherefore some essential difference must exist in the nature of their\r\nultimate molecules. The same difference is to be traced between the\r\njuices of such plants as give sugar similar to that from the cane, and\r\nthose which give sugar like that obtained from grapes.\r\n\r\nIf chlorate of soda be dissolved in water, the liquid has no circular\r\npolarization; but if the solution be allowed to crystallize, some of the\r\ncrystals turn the light to the right and others to the left. Now, if all\r\nthose of one kind be gathered together and dissolved a second time, the\r\nliquid will have no circular polarization; but if crystals be allowed to\r\nform, some will turn the light to the right and others to the left,\r\nalthough only one kind was dissolved.[11]\r\n\r\nIt is a fact established by M. Biot, that in circular polarization the\r\nlaws of rotation followed by the different simple rays of light are\r\ndissimilar in different substances. Whence he infers that the deviation\r\nof the simple rays from one another ought not to result from a special\r\nproperty of the luminous principle only, but that the proper action of\r\nthe molecules must also concur in modifying the deviations of the simple\r\nrays differently in different substances.\r\n\r\nOne of the many brilliant discoveries of M. Fresnel is the production of\r\ncircular and elliptical polarization by the internal reflection of light\r\nfrom plate-glass. He has shown that, if light polarized by any of the\r\nusual methods be twice reflected within a glass rhomb (N. 169) of a\r\ngiven form, the vibrations of the ether that are perpendicular to the\r\nplane of incidence will be retarded a quarter of a vibration, which\r\ncauses the vibrating particles to describe circles, and the succession\r\nof such vibrating particles throughout the extent of a wave to form\r\naltogether a circular helix, or curve like a corkscrew. However, that\r\nonly happens when the plane of polarization is inclined at an angle of\r\n45° to the plane of incidence. When these two planes form an angle\r\neither greater or less, the succession of vibrating particles forms an\r\nelliptical helix, which curve may be represented by twisting a thread in\r\na spiral about an oval rod. These curves will turn to the right or left,\r\naccording to the position of the incident plane.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the ethereal medium in elliptical and circular\r\npolarization may be represented by the analogy of a stretched cord; for,\r\nif the extremity of such a cord be agitated at equal and regular\r\nintervals by a vibratory motion entirely confined to one plane, the cord\r\nwill be thrown into an undulating curve lying wholly in that plane. If\r\nto this motion there be superadded another similar and equal, but\r\nperpendicular to the first, the cord will assume the form of an\r\nelliptical helix; its extremity will describe an ellipse, and every\r\nmolecule throughout its length will successively do the same. But, if\r\nthe second system of vibrations commence exactly a quarter of an\r\nundulation later than the first, the cord will take the form of a\r\ncircular helix or corkscrew, the extremity will move uniformly in a\r\ncircle, and every molecule throughout the cord will do the same in\r\nsuccession. It appears, therefore, that both circular and elliptical\r\npolarization may be produced by the composition of the motions of two\r\nrays in which the particles of ether vibrate in planes at right angles\r\nto one another.\r\n\r\nProfessor Airy, in a very profound and able paper published in the\r\nCambridge Transactions, has proved that all the different kinds of\r\npolarized light are obtained from rock crystal. When polarized light is\r\ntransmitted through the axis of a crystal of quartz, in the emergent ray\r\nthe particles of ether move in a circular helix; and when it is\r\ntransmitted obliquely so as to form an angle with the axis of the prism,\r\nthe particles of ether move in an elliptical helix, the ellipticity\r\nincreasing with the obliquity of the incident ray; so that, when the\r\nincident ray falls perpendicularly to the axis, the particles of ether\r\nmove in a straight line. Thus quartz exhibits every variety of\r\nelliptical polarization, even including the extreme cases where the\r\nexcentricity is zero, or equal to the greater axis of the ellipse\r\n(N. 215). In many crystals the two rays are so little separated, that it\r\nis only from the nature of the transmitted light that they are known to\r\nhave the property of double refraction. M. Fresnel discovered, by\r\nexperiments on the properties of light passing through the axis of\r\nquartz, that it consists of two superposed rays, moving with different\r\nvelocities; and Professor Airy has shown that in these two rays the\r\nmolecules of ether vibrate in similar ellipses at right angles to each\r\nother, but in different directions; that their ellipticity varies with\r\nthe angle which the incident ray makes with the axis; and that, by the\r\ncomposition of their motions, they produce all the phenomena of\r\npolarized light observed in quartz.\r\n\r\nIt appears, from what has been said, that the molecules of ether always\r\nperform their vibrations at right angles to the direction of the ray,\r\nbut very differently in the various kinds of light. In natural light the\r\nvibrations are rectilinear, and in every plane. In ordinary polarized\r\nlight they are rectilinear, but confined to one plane; in circular\r\npolarization the vibrations are circular; and in elliptical polarization\r\nthe molecules vibrate in ellipses. These vibrations are communicated\r\nfrom molecule to molecule, in straight lines when they are rectilinear,\r\nin a circular helix when they are circular, and in an oval or elliptical\r\nhelix when elliptical.\r\n\r\nSome fluids possess the property of circular polarization naturally, as\r\noil of turpentine, the essential oils of laurel and lemon, sugar of\r\ngrapes, and various liquids.\r\n\r\nElliptical polarization is produced by reflection from metallic\r\nsurfaces. Mr. Baden Powell discovered it also in the light reflected\r\nfrom China ink, chromate of lead, plumbago, &c. Mr. Airy observed that\r\nthe light reflected from the diamond is elliptically polarized; and Mr.\r\nJamin has shown that this kind of polarization is generally produced by\r\nreflection from almost all transparent bodies, whatever their refractive\r\npower may be, especially from glass at angles very little different from\r\nthe law of the tangents.\r\n\r\nWater polarizes light circularly when between the points of maximum\r\ndensity and solidification; hence it becomes crystalline.\r\n\r\nThe coloured images from polarized light arise from the interference of\r\nthe rays (N. 216). MM. Fresnel and Arago found that two rays of\r\npolarized light interfere and produce coloured fringes if they be\r\npolarized in the same plane, but that they do not interfere when\r\npolarized in different planes. In all intermediate positions, fringes of\r\nintermediate brightness are produced. The analogy of a stretched cord\r\nwill show how this happens. Suppose the cord to be moved backwards and\r\nforwards horizontally at equal intervals; it will be thrown into an\r\nundulating curve lying all in one plane. If to this motion there be\r\nsuperadded another similar and equal, commencing exactly half an\r\nundulation later than the first, it is evident that the direct motion\r\nevery molecule will assume, in consequence of the first system of waves,\r\nwill at every instant be exactly neutralized by the retrograde motion it\r\nwould take in virtue of the second; and the cord itself will be\r\nquiescent in consequence of the interference. But, if the second system\r\nof waves be in a plane perpendicular to the first, the effect would only\r\nbe to twist the rope, so that no interference would take place. Rays\r\npolarized at right angles to each other may subsequently be brought into\r\nthe same plane without acquiring the property of producing coloured\r\nfringes; but, if they belong to a pencil the whole of which was\r\noriginally polarized in the same plane, they will interfere.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the coloured images are formed may be conceived by\r\nconsidering that, when polarized light passes through the optic axis of\r\na doubly refracting substance,—as mica, for example,—it is divided into\r\ntwo pencils by the analyzing tourmaline; and, as one ray is absorbed,\r\nthere can be no interference. But, when polarized light passes through\r\nthe mica in any other direction, it is separated into two white rays,\r\nand these are again divided into four pencils by the tourmaline, which\r\nabsorbs two of them; and the other two, being transmitted in the same\r\nplane with different velocities, interfere and produce the coloured\r\nphenomena. If the analysis be made with Iceland spar, the single ray\r\npassing through the optic axis of the mica will be refracted into two\r\nrays, polarized in different planes, and no interference will happen.\r\nBut, when two rays are transmitted by the mica, they will be separated\r\ninto four by the spar, two of which will interfere to form one image,\r\nand the other two, by their interference, will produce the complementary\r\ncolours of the other image when the spar has revolved through 90°;\r\nbecause, in such positions of the spar as produce the coloured images,\r\nonly two rays are visible at a time, the other two being reflected. When\r\nthe analysis is accomplished by reflection, if two rays are transmitted\r\nby the mica, they are polarized in planes at right angles to each other.\r\nAnd, if the plane of reflection of either of these rays be at right\r\nangles to the plane of polarization, only one of them will be reflected,\r\nand therefore no interference can take place; but in all other positions\r\nof the analyzing plate both rays will be reflected in the same plane,\r\nand consequently will produce coloured rings by their interference.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a great deal of the light we see must be polarized,\r\nsince most bodies which have the power of reflecting or refracting light\r\nalso have the power of polarizing it. The blue light of the sky is\r\ncompletely polarized at an angle of 74° from the sun in a plane passing\r\nthrough his centre.\r\n\r\nA constellation of talent almost unrivalled at any period in the history\r\nof science has contributed to the theory of polarization, though the\r\noriginal discovery of that property of light was accidental, and arose\r\nfrom an occurrence which, like thousands of others, would have passed\r\nunnoticed had it not happened to one of those rare minds capable of\r\ndrawing the most important inferences from circumstances apparently\r\ntrifling. In 1808, while M. Malus was accidentally viewing with a\r\ndoubly-refracting prism a brilliant sunset reflected from the windows of\r\nthe Luxembourg Palace in Paris, on turning the prism slowly round, he\r\nwas surprised to see a very great difference in the intensity of the two\r\nimages, the most refracted alternately changing from brightness to\r\nobscurity at each quadrant of revolution. A phenomenon so unlooked for\r\ninduced him to investigate its cause, whence sprung one of the most\r\nelegant and refined branches of physical optics.\r\n\r\nFluorescence, or the internal dispersion of light, though far from\r\npossessing the beauty or extensive consequences of polarized light, is\r\nscarcely less wonderful. A variety of substances, such as canary-glass,\r\na solution of sulphate of quinine, fluor-spar, and a great number of\r\norganic substances, have the property of diminishing the refrangibility\r\nof light by internal dispersion, consequently of increasing the length\r\nof the waves, and lowering the colour in the prismatic scale; it is\r\ntherefore called degraded light, or fluorescence, because first\r\ndiscovered in fluor-spar.\r\n\r\nIf a piece of glass coloured by cobalt be fixed in a hole in a\r\nwindow-shutter of a dark room, a slab of white porcelain placed near it\r\nwill appear blue; but if the slab be viewed through a yellow glass\r\ncoloured by silver, it will appear to be almost quite black, because the\r\nyellow glass absorbs all the rays transmitted by the blue glass. If,\r\nhowever, a piece of canary-glass be laid on the slab while it is dark,\r\nevery part of the canary-glass will shine as if it were self-luminous,\r\nand with so bright a light that anything written on the slab that was\r\ninvisible before may now be distinctly read. Such is the singular\r\nphenomenon of internal dispersion, degraded light, or fluorescence. The\r\nbrightness is by no means due to phosphorescence, because the\r\ncanary-glass only shines when under the influence of the active or blue\r\nrays, whereas phosphorescent bodies shine by their own light—the latter\r\nhas independent, the former dependent, emission; it is possible,\r\nhowever, that a connexion may hereafter be traced between them.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the analytical investigation of this phenomenon that the\r\nvibrations of the fluorescent substance are analogous to those of a\r\nsonorous body, as a bell or musical cord, which give the fundamental\r\nnote and its harmonics. Now since there is a reciprocal action between\r\nthe molecules of matter and light, when the light of the sun is absorbed\r\nby a substance capable of fluorescence, it puts the whole of its\r\nmolecules into vibrations the same as its own, analogous to the\r\nfundamental note, while at the same time a certain number of molecules\r\ntake more rapid vibrations exactly like the harmonics. The latter form\r\nnew centres of light throughout the substance, which impart their\r\nvibrations to the ethereal medium around, and constitute fluorescence or\r\ndegraded light. For example, in the experiment that has been described,\r\nthe blue light imparted its own vibrations to _all_ the molecules of the\r\ncanary-glass, and also more rapid vibrations to a certain number of\r\nthem. All of the blue rays were excluded by the yellow glass held before\r\nthe eye; but it was pervious to the rays emanating in more rapid\r\nvibrations from the smaller number of molecules, which thus became\r\nreally new centres of light, different from the sun’s light, though\r\nowing to it; the one celestial, the other terrestrial; and the latter\r\nvibrations being more rapid than those of the blue light, their\r\nrefrangibility was less, and therefore their colour lower in the\r\nprismatic scale. Mr. Power computed from his formulæ, that fluorescent\r\nlight is produced by undulations which are a major or minor third below\r\nthe pitch of the general vibration of the medium—that is to say, below\r\nthe vibrations which the whole molecules of the body most readily\r\nassume.\r\n\r\nProfessor Stokes, of Cambridge, who made the preceding experiment, found\r\nthat the chemical rays from a point in the solar spectrum produced, in a\r\nsolution of the sulphate of quinine, light of a sky-blue colour, which\r\nemanates in all directions from the liquid, and that this blue\r\nfluorescent light contains, when analysed, all the rays of the spectrum;\r\nhence he inferred that the dispersive power or fluorescence had lowered\r\nthe refrangibility of the chemical rays, so as to make them visible: and\r\nSir David Brewster observes that the new spectrum, of all colours into\r\nwhich they were transformed, must possess the extraordinary property of\r\nbeing a luminous spectrum, either without chemical rays or full of them.\r\nThe dispersion in the quinine solution is greatest near the surface, but\r\nthe blue emanation proceeds from every part of the liquid; and Sir John\r\nHerschel, who discovered the fluorescent property in this liquid, and\r\ngave it the name of epipolic light, found that the remainder of the\r\nbeam, when it issued from the solution, though not apparently different\r\nfrom the incident white light, is yet so much changed in passing through\r\nthe liquid, that it is no longer capable of producing fluorescence,\r\nthough still capable of common dispersion. The blue light from the\r\nsolution of quinine, when examined, consisted of rays extending over a\r\ngreat part of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nBy passing a sunbeam through a bluish kind of fluor-spar, Sir David\r\nBrewster perceived that the blue colour is not superficial, as it\r\nappears to be, but that some veins in the interior of the crystal\r\ndisperse blue light, others pink, and even white light; in short, he met\r\nwith fluorescence in such a variety of substances, that he concludes it\r\nmay prevail more or less in the greater number of solids and liquids.\r\n\r\nProfessor Draper, of New York, proved that the result is the same\r\nwhether the incident light be polarized or not, and that the dispersed\r\nor degraded light is never polarized, but that it emanates in all\r\ndirections, as if the substance were self-luminous; he made experiments\r\nwith light from all parts of the solar spectrum, and with various\r\nsubstances, and always found that the refrangibility of the incident ray\r\nwas diminished by internal dispersion, and that the colour was changed\r\nto suit the new refrangibility. Professor Draper has also shown that the\r\nlaw of action and reaction prevails in all the phenomena of the sunbeam,\r\nas in every other department of nature; so that a beam cannot be\r\nreflected, refracted, much less absorbed, without producing some change\r\nupon the recipient medium; and Mr. Power proved analytically that the\r\nsolar rays can exercise no action upon any medium through which they are\r\ntransmitted, without being accompanied by a diminution of refraction. He\r\nsays, “The new light emanating from the fluorescent media is just like\r\nany other light of the same prismatic composition. In its physical\r\nproperties it retains no trace of its parentage; it is of terrestrial\r\norigin, and its colour depends simply on its new refrangibility, having\r\nnothing to do with that of the producing rays, nor to the circumstance\r\nof their belonging to the visible or invisible part of the spectrum.”\r\nThese phenomena can only be explained by the undulatory theory of light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION XXIII.\r\n\r\nObjections to the Undulatory Theory, from a difference in the Action of\r\n  Sound and Light under the same circumstances, removed—The Dispersion\r\n  of Light according to the Undulatory Theory—Arago’s final proof that\r\n  the Undulatory Theory is the Law of Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE numerous phenomena of periodical colours arising from the\r\ninterference of light, which do not admit of satisfactory explanation on\r\nany other principle than the undulatory theory, are the strongest\r\narguments in favour of that hypothesis; and even cases which at one time\r\nseemed unfavourable to that doctrine have proved upon investigation to\r\nproceed from it alone. Such is the erroneous objection which has been\r\nmade, in consequence of a difference in the mode of action of light and\r\nsound, under the same circumstances, in one particular instance. When a\r\nray of light from a luminous point, and a diverging sound, are both\r\ntransmitted through a very small hole into a dark room, the light goes\r\nstraight forward and illuminates a small spot on the opposite wall,\r\nleaving the rest in darkness; whereas the sound on entering diverges in\r\nall directions, and is heard in every part of the room. These phenomena,\r\nhowever, instead of being at variance with the undulatory theory, are\r\ndirect consequences of it, arising from the very great difference\r\nbetween the magnitude of the undulations of sound and those of light.\r\nThe undulations of light are incomparably less than the minute aperture,\r\nwhile those of sound are much greater. Therefore when light, diverging\r\nfrom a luminous point, enters the hole, the rays round its edges are\r\noblique, and consequently of different lengths, while those in the\r\ncentre are direct, and nearly or altogether of the same lengths. So that\r\nthe small undulations between the centre and the edges are in different\r\nphases, that is, in different states of undulation. Therefore the\r\ngreater number of them interfere, and by destroying one another produce\r\ndarkness all around the edges of the aperture; whereas the central rays,\r\nhaving the same phases, combine, and produce a spot of bright light on a\r\nwall or screen directly opposite the hole. The waves of air producing\r\nsound, on the contrary, being very large compared with the hole, do not\r\nsensibly diverge in passing through it, and are therefore all so nearly\r\nof the same length, and consequently in the same phase or state of\r\nundulation, that none of them interfere sufficiently to destroy one\r\nanother. Hence all the particles of air in the room are set into a state\r\nof vibration, so that the intensity of the sound is very nearly\r\neverywhere the same. Strong as the preceding cases may be, the following\r\nexperiment, made by M. Arago, seems to be decisive in favour of the\r\nundulatory doctrine. Suppose a plano-convex lens of very great radius to\r\nbe placed upon a plate of very highly polished metal. When a ray of\r\npolarized light falls upon this apparatus at a very great angle of\r\nincidence, Newton’s rings are seen at the point of contact. But as the\r\npolarizing angle of glass differs from that of metal, when the light\r\nfalls on the lens at the polarizing angle of glass, the black spot and\r\nthe system of rings vanish. For although light in abundance continues to\r\nbe reflected from the surface of the metal, not a ray is reflected from\r\nthe surface of the glass that is in contact with it, consequently no\r\ninterference can take place; which proves beyond a doubt that Newton’s\r\nrings result from the interference of the light reflected from both the\r\nsurfaces apparently in contact (N. 199).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the successful adaptation of the undulatory system to\r\nphenomena, the dispersion of light for a long time offered a formidable\r\nobjection to that theory, which has been removed by Professor Powell of\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\nA sunbeam falling on a prism, instead of being refracted to a single\r\npoint of white light, is separated into its component colours, which are\r\ndispersed or scattered unequally over a considerable space, of which the\r\nportion occupied by the red rays is the least, and that over which the\r\nviolet rays are dispersed is the greatest. Thus the rays of the coloured\r\nspectrum, whose waves are of different lengths, have different degrees\r\nof refrangibility, and consequently move with different velocities,\r\neither in the medium which conveys the light from the sun, or in the\r\nrefracting medium, or in both; whereas rays of all colours come from the\r\nsun to the earth with the same velocity. If, indeed, the velocities of\r\nthe various rays were different in space, the aberration of the fixed\r\nstars, which is inversely as the velocity, would be different for\r\ndifferent colours, and every star would appear as a spectrum whose\r\nlength would be parallel to the direction of the earth’s motion, which\r\nis not found to agree with observation. Besides, there is no such\r\ndifference in the velocities of the long and short waves of air in the\r\nanalogous case of sound, since notes of the lowest and highest pitch are\r\nheard in the order in which they are struck. In fact, when the sunbeam\r\npasses from air into the prism, its velocity is diminished; and, as its\r\nrefraction, and consequently its dispersion, depend solely upon the\r\ndiminished velocity of the transmission of its waves, they ought to be\r\nthe same for waves of all lengths, unless a connexion exists between the\r\nlength of a wave and the velocity with which it is propagated. Now, this\r\nconnexion between the length of a wave of any colour, and its velocity\r\nor refrangibility in a given medium, has been deduced by Professor\r\nPowell from M. Cauchy’s investigations of the properties of light on a\r\npeculiar modification of the undulatory hypothesis. Hence the\r\nrefrangibility of the various coloured rays, computed from this relation\r\nfor any given medium, when compared with their refrangibility in the\r\nsame medium determined by actual observation, will show whether the\r\ndispersion of light comes under the laws of that theory. But, in order\r\nto accomplish this, it is clear that the length of the waves should be\r\nfound independently of refraction, and a very beautiful discovery of M.\r\nFraunhofer furnishes the means of doing so.\r\n\r\nThat philosopher obtained a perfectly pure and complete coloured\r\nspectrum, with all its dark and bright lines, by the interference of\r\nlight alone, from a sunbeam passing through a series of fine parallel\r\nwires covering the object glass of a telescope. In this spectrum, formed\r\nindependently of prismatic refraction, the positions of the coloured\r\nrays depend only on the lengths of their waves, and M. Fraunhofer found\r\nthat the intervals between them are precisely proportional to the\r\ndifferences of these lengths. He measured the lengths of the waves of\r\nthe different colours at seven fixed points, determined by seven of the\r\nprincipal dark and bright lines. Professor Powell, availing himself of\r\nthese measures, has made the requisite computations, and has found that\r\nthe coincidence of theory with observation is perfect for ten substances\r\nwhose refrangibility had been previously determined by the direct\r\nmeasurements of M. Fraunhofer, and for ten others whose refrangibility\r\nhas more recently been ascertained by M. Rudberg. Thus, in the case of\r\nseven rays in each of twenty different substances, solid and fluid, the\r\ndispersion of light takes place according to the laws of the undulatory\r\ntheory: and there can hardly be a doubt that dispersion in all other\r\nbodies will be found to follow the same law. It is, however, an express\r\ncondition of the connexion between the velocity of light and the length\r\nof its undulations, that the intervals between the vibrating molecules\r\nof the ethereal fluid should bear a sensible relation to the length of\r\nan undulation. The coincidence of the computed with the observed\r\nrefractions shows that this condition is fulfilled within the refracting\r\nmedia; but the aberration of the fixed stars leads to the inference that\r\nit does not hold in the ethereal regions, where the velocities of the\r\nrays of all colours are the same. Strong as all that precedes is in\r\nfavour of the undulatory theory, the relative velocity of light in air\r\nand water is the final and decisive proof. By the Newtonian theory the\r\nvelocity is greater in water than in air, by the undulatory theory it is\r\nless; hence if a comparison could be made it would decide which is the\r\nlaw of nature. The difficulty consisted in comparing the velocity of\r\nlight passing through a small extent of water with the velocity of light\r\nin air, which is 10,000 times greater than the velocity of the earth in\r\nits orbit. This delicate and difficult experiment was made by means of\r\nan instrument invented by Professor Wheatstone for measuring the\r\nvelocity of electricity. It consists of a small mirror which revolves in\r\nits own plane like a coin spinning on its edge. When it revolves very\r\nrapidly the reflected image of an object changes its place perceptibly\r\nin an inconceivably small fraction of a second. The mirrors used in the\r\nexperiment were made to revolve more than 1000 times in a second, by\r\nwhich means the places of the two images—one from light passing through\r\nair, and the other from light passing through an equal length of\r\nwater—were found to be such as to prove that the velocity of light in\r\nair and in water is as 4 to 3, while by the Newtonian theory it is as 3\r\nto 4. By this final and decisive proof the undulatory theory may from\r\nhenceforth be regarded as the law of nature. This experiment was\r\naccomplished by M. Fizeau and M. Léon-Faucault, at the suggestion of M.\r\nArago, whose eyesight did not permit him to undertake it himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION XXIV.\r\n\r\nChemical or Photographic Rays of Solar Spectrum—Scheele, Ritter, and\r\n  Wollaston’s Discoveries—Wedgwood’s and Sir Humphry Davy’s Photographic\r\n  Pictures—The Calotype—The Daguerreotype—The Chromatype—The\r\n  Cyanotype—Collodion—Sir John Herschel’s Discoveries in the Chemical\r\n  Spectrum—M.

Collodion and metallic salts,\r\nespecially those of silver, whose molecules are held together by an\r\nunstable equilibrium, are of all bodies the most susceptible of its\r\ninfluence; the effects, however, vary with the substances employed, and\r\nwith the different rays of the solar spectrum, the chemical properties\r\nof which are by no means alike. As early as 1772 M. Scheele showed that\r\nthe pure white colour of chloride of silver was rapidly darkened by the\r\nblue rays of the solar spectrum, while the red rays had no effect upon\r\nit: and in 1801 M. Ritter discovered that invisible rays beyond the\r\nviolet extremity have the property of blackening argentine salts, that\r\nthis property diminishes towards the less refrangible part of the\r\nspectrum, and that the red rays have an opposite quality, that of\r\nrestoring the blackened salt of silver to its original purity; from\r\nwhich he inferred that the most refrangible extremity of the spectrum\r\nhas an oxygenising power, and the other that of deoxygenating. Dr.\r\nWollaston found that gum guaiacum acquires a green colour in the violet\r\nand blue rays, and resumes its original tint in the red. No attempt had\r\nbeen made to trace natural objects by means of light reflected from\r\nthem, till Mr. Wedgwood, together with Sir Humphry Davy, took up the\r\nsubject: they produced profiles and tracings of objects on surfaces\r\nprepared with nitrate and chloride of silver, but they did not succeed\r\nin rendering their pictures permanent. This difficulty was overcome in\r\n1814 by M. Niepcé, who produced a permanent picture of surrounding\r\nobjects by placing in the focus of a camera-obscura a metallic plate\r\ncovered with a film of asphalt dissolved in oil of lavender.\r\n\r\nMr. Fox Talbot, without any knowledge of M. Niepcé’s experiments, had\r\nbeen engaged in the same pursuit, and must be regarded as an independent\r\ninventor of photography, one of the most beautiful arts of modern times:\r\nhe was the first who succeeded in using paper chemically prepared for\r\nreceiving impressions from natural objects; and he also discovered a\r\nmethod of fixing permanently the impressions—that is, of rendering the\r\npaper insensible to any further action of light. In the calotype, one of\r\nMr. Talbot’s applications of the art, the photographic surface is\r\nprepared by washing smooth writing-paper, first with a solution of\r\nnitrate of silver, then with bromide of potassium, and again with\r\nnitrate of silver, drying it at a fire after each washing; the paper is\r\nthus rendered so sensitive to light that even the passage of a thin\r\ncloud is perceptible on it, consequently it must be prepared by\r\ncandle-light. Portraits, buildings, insects, leaves of plants—in short,\r\nevery object is accurately delineated in a few seconds; and in the focus\r\nof a camera-obscura the most minute objects are so exactly depicted that\r\nthe microscope reveals new beauties.\r\n\r\nSince the effect of the chemical agency of light is to destroy the\r\naffinity between the salt and the silver, Mr. Talbot found that, in\r\norder to render these impressions permanent on paper, it was only\r\nnecessary to wash it with salt and water, or with a solution of iodide\r\nof potassium. For these liquids the liquid hyposulphites have been\r\nadvantageously substituted, which are the most efficacious in dissolving\r\nand removing the unchanged salt, leaving the reduced silver on the\r\npaper. The calotype picture is negative, that is, the lights and shadows\r\nare the reverse of what they are in nature, and the right-hand side in\r\nnature is the left in the picture; but if it be placed with its face\r\npressed against photographic paper, between a board and a plate of\r\nglass, and exposed to the sun a short time, a positive and direct\r\npicture, as it is in nature, is formed: engravings may be exactly copied\r\nby this simple process, and a direct picture may be produced at once by\r\nusing photographic paper already made brown by exposure to light.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Fox Talbot was engaged in these very elegant discoveries in\r\nEngland, M. Daguerre had brought to perfection and made public that\r\nadmirable process by which he has compelled Nature permanently to\r\nengrave her own works; and thus the talents of France and England have\r\nbeen combined in bringing to perfection this useful art. Copper, plated\r\nwith silver, was successfully employed by M. Daguerre for copying nature\r\nby the agency of light. The surface of the plate is converted into an\r\niodide of silver, by placing it horizontally with its face downwards in\r\na covered box, in the bottom of which there is a small quantity of\r\niodine which evaporates spontaneously. In three or four minutes the\r\nsurface acquires a yellow tint, and then, screening it carefully from\r\nlight, it must be placed in the focus of a camera obscura, where an\r\ninvisible image of external objects will be impressed on it in a few\r\nminutes. When taken out, the plate must be exposed in another box to the\r\naction of mercurial vapour, which attaches itself to those parts of the\r\nplate which had been exposed to light, but does not adhere to such parts\r\nas had been in shadow; and as the quantity of mercury over the other\r\nparts is in exact proportion to the degree of illumination, the shading\r\nof the picture is perfect. The image is fixed, first by removing the\r\niodine from the plate by plunging it into hyposulphite of soda, and then\r\nwashing it in distilled water; by this process the yellow colour is\r\ndestroyed, and in order to render the mercury permanent, the plate must\r\nbe exposed a few minutes to nitric vapour, then placed in nitric acid\r\ncontaining copper or silver in solution at a temperature of 61-1/4° of\r\nFahrenheit for a short time, and lastly polished with chalk. This final\r\npart of the process is due to Dr. Berre, of Vienna.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more beautiful than the shading of these chiaroscuro\r\npictures when objects are at rest, but the least motion destroys the\r\neffect; the method therefore is more applicable to buildings than\r\nlandscape. Colour is wanting; but the researches of Sir John Herschel\r\ngive reason to believe that even this will ultimately be attained.\r\n\r\nThe most perfect impressions of seaweeds, leaves of plants, feathers,\r\n&c., may be formed by bringing the object into close contact with a\r\nsheet of photographic paper, between a board and plate of glass; then\r\nexposing the whole to the sun for a short time, and afterwards fixing it\r\nby the process described. The colours of the pictures vary with the\r\npreparation of the paper, by which almost any tint may be produced.\r\n\r\nIn the chromatype, a peculiar photograph discovered by Mr. Hunt,\r\nchromate of copper is used, on which a dark brown negative image is\r\nfirst formed, but by the continued action of light it is changed to a\r\npositive yellow picture on a white ground; the farther effect of light\r\nis checked by washing the picture in pure water.\r\n\r\nIn cyanotypes, a class of photographs discovered by Sir John Herschel,\r\nin which cyanogen in its combinations with iron forms the ground, the\r\npictures are Prussian blue and white. In the chrysotype of the same\r\neminent philosopher, the image is first received on paper prepared with\r\nthe ammonia-citrate of iron, and afterwards washed with a neutral\r\nsolution of gold. It is fixed by water acidulated with sulphuric acid,\r\nand lastly by hydriodate of potash, from which a white and purple\r\nphotograph results. It is vain to attempt to describe the various\r\nbeautiful effects which Sir John Herschel obtained from chemical\r\ncompounds, and from the juices of plants; the juice of the red poppy\r\ngives a positive bluish purple image, that of the ten-week stock a fine\r\nrose colour on a pale straw-coloured ground.\r\n\r\nPictures may be made by exposure to sunshine, on all compound substances\r\nhaving a weak chemical affinity; but the image is often invisible, as in\r\nthe Daguerreotype, till brought out by washing in some chemical\r\npreparation. Water is frequently sufficient; indeed Sir John Herschel\r\nbrought out dormant photographs by breathing on them, and some\r\nsubstances are insensible to the action of light till moistened, as for\r\nexample, gum guaiacum. Argentine papers, however, are little subject to\r\nthe influence of moisture. The power of the solar rays is augmented in\r\ncertain cases by placing a plate of glass in close contact over the\r\nsensitive surface.\r\n\r\nAll these various experiments, though highly interesting, have now been\r\nsuperseded. It was found that paper did not always answer for\r\nphotography, on account of imperfections in its structure; silver plates\r\nwere too expensive; and glass was found to be unimpressable.\r\nNevertheless, M. Niepcé de Victor obtained beautiful results upon glass\r\ncoated with albumen mixed with sensitive substances, which suggested the\r\nmedium by means of which the art has been brought to its present\r\nperfection, and that final step is due to Mr. Scott Archer. He coated a\r\nplate of glass thinly with collodion, that is, gun-cotton dissolved in\r\nether and alcohol, which dries into a delicate transparent film of\r\nextreme adhesiveness, and of such intense sensibility that the action of\r\nlight upon it is so instantaneous that it arrests a stormy sea or a\r\nfleeting cloud before they have time to change. Now landscapes in\r\nchiaroscuro are produced of great beauty, which by the slower methods\r\nwere mere masses of deep shade and broad light. Architecture is even\r\nmore perfectly obtained, but it fails to give a pleasing representation\r\nof the human countenance.\r\n\r\nChemical action always accompanies the sun’s light, but the analysis of\r\nthe solar spectrum has partly disclosed the wonderful nature of the\r\nemanation. In the research, properties most important and unexpected\r\nhave been discovered by Sir John Herschel, who imprints the stamp of\r\ngenius on all he touches—his eloquent papers can alone convey an\r\nadequate idea of their value in opening a field of inquiry vast and\r\nuntrodden. The following brief and imperfect account of his experiments\r\nis all that can be attempted here:—\r\n\r\nA certain degree of chemical energy is distributed through every part of\r\nthe solar spectrum, and also to a considerable extent through the dark\r\nspaces at each extremity. This distribution does not depend on the\r\nrefrangibility of the rays alone, but also on the nature of the rays\r\nthemselves, and on the physical properties of the analyzing medium on\r\nwhich the rays are received, whose changes indicate and measure their\r\naction. The length of the photographic image of the _same_ solar\r\nspectrum varies with the physical qualities of the surface on which it\r\nis impressed. When the solar spectrum is received on paper prepared with\r\nbromide of silver, the chemical spectrum, as indicated merely by the\r\nlength of the darkened part, includes within its limits the whole\r\nluminous spectrum, extending in one direction far beyond the extreme\r\nviolet and lavender rays, and in the other down to the extremest red:\r\nwith tartrate of silver the darkening occupies not only all the space\r\nunder the most refrangible rays, but reaches much beyond the extreme\r\nred. On paper prepared with formobenzoate of silver the chemical\r\nspectrum is cut off at the orange rays, with phosphate of silver in the\r\nyellow, and with chloride of gold it terminates with the green, with\r\ncarbonate of mercury it ends in the blue, and on paper prepared with the\r\npercyanide of gold, ammonia, and nitrate of silver, the darkening lies\r\nentirely beyond the visible spectrum at its most refrangible extremity,\r\nand is only half its length, whereas in some cases chemical action\r\noccupies a space more than twice the length of the luminous image.\r\n\r\nThe point of maximum energy of chemical action varies as much for\r\ndifferent preparations as the scale of action. In the greater number of\r\ncases the point of deepest blackening lies about the lower edge of the\r\nindigo rays, though in no two cases is it exactly the same, and in many\r\nsubstances it is widely different. On paper prepared with the juice of\r\nthe ten-week stock (Mathiola annua) there are two maxima, one in the\r\nmean yellow and a weaker in the violet; and on a preparation of tartrate\r\nof silver Sir John Herschel found three, one in the least refrangible\r\nblue, one in the indigo, and a third beyond the visible violet. The\r\ndecrease in photographic energy is seldom perfectly alike on both sides\r\nof the maximum. Thus at the most refrangible end of the solar spectrum\r\nthe greatest chemical power is exerted in most instances where there is\r\nleast light and heat, and even in the space where both sensibly cease.\r\n\r\nNot only the intensity but the kind of action is different in the\r\ndifferent points of the solar spectrum, as evidently appears from the\r\nvarious colours that are frequently impressed on the same analyzing\r\nsurface, each ray having a tendency to impart its own colour. Sir John\r\nHerschel obtained a coloured image of the solar spectrum on paper\r\nprepared according to Mr. Talbot’s principle, from a sunbeam refracted\r\nby a glass prism and then highly condensed by a lens. The photographic\r\nimage was rapidly formed and very intense, and, when withdrawn from the\r\nspectrum and viewed in common daylight, it was found to be coloured with\r\nsombre but unequivocal tints imitating the prismatic colours, which\r\nvaried gradually from red through green and blue to a purplish black.\r\nAfter washing the surface in water, the tints became more decided by\r\nbeing kept a few days in the dark—a phenomenon, Sir John observes, of\r\nconstant occurrence, whatever be the preparation of the paper, provided\r\ncolours are produced at all. He also obtained a coloured image on\r\nnitrate of silver, the part under the blue rays becoming a blue brown,\r\nwhile that under the violet had a pinkish shade, and sometimes green\r\nappeared at the point corresponding to the least refrangible blue. Mr.\r\nHunt found on a paper prepared with fluoride of silver that a yellow\r\nline was impressed on the space occupied by the yellow rays, a green\r\nband on the space under the green rays, an intense blue throughout the\r\nspace on which the blue and indigo rays fell, and under the violet rays\r\na ruddy brown appeared; these colours remained clear and distinct after\r\nbeing kept two months.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great variety in the scale of action of the solar\r\nspectrum, the darkening or deoxydizing principle that prevails in the\r\nmore refrangible part rarely surpasses or even attains the mean yellow\r\nray which is the point of maximum illumination; it is generally cut off\r\nabruptly at that point which seems to form a limit between the opposing\r\npowers which prevail at the two ends of the spectrum. The bleaching or\r\noxydizing effect of the red rays on blackened muriate of silver\r\ndiscovered by M. Ritter of Jena, and the restoration by the same rays of\r\ndiscoloured gum guaiacum to its original tint by Dr. Wollaston, have\r\nalready been mentioned as giving the first indications of that\r\ndifference in the mode of action of the chemical rays at the two ends of\r\nthe visible spectrum, now placed beyond a doubt.\r\n\r\nThe action exerted by the less refrangible rays beyond and at the red\r\nextremity of the solar spectrum, in most instances, so far from\r\nblackening metallic salts, protects them from the action of the diffused\r\ndaylight: but, if the prepared surface has already been blackened by\r\nexposure to the sun, they possess the remarkable property of bleaching\r\nit in some cases, and under other circumstances of changing the black\r\nsurface into a fiery red.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel, to whom we owe most of our knowledge of the\r\nproperties of the chemical spectrum, prepared a sheet of paper by\r\nwashing it with muriate of ammonia, and then with two coats of nitrate\r\nof silver; on this surface he obtained an impression of the solar\r\nspectrum exhibiting a range of colours very nearly corresponding with\r\nits natural hues. But a very remarkable phenomenon occurred at the end\r\nof least refrangibility; the red rays exerted a protecting influence\r\nwhich preserved the paper from the change which it would otherwise have\r\nundergone from the deoxydizing influence of the dispersed light which\r\nalways surrounds the solar spectrum, and this maintained its whiteness.\r\nSir John met with another instance on paper prepared with bromide of\r\nsilver, on which the whole of the space occupied by the visible spectrum\r\nwas darkened down to the very extremity of the red rays, but an\r\noxydizing action commenced beyond the extreme red, which maintained the\r\nwhiteness of the paper to a considerable distance beyond the last\r\ntraceable limit of the visible rays, thus evincing decidedly the\r\nexistence of some chemical power over a considerable space beyond the\r\nleast refrangible end of the spectrum. Mr. Hunt also found that on the\r\nDaguerreotype plate a powerful protecting influence is exercised by the\r\nextreme red rays. In these cases the red and those dark rays beyond them\r\nexert an action of an opposite nature to that of the violet and lavender\r\nrays.\r\n\r\nThe least refrangible part of the solar spectrum possesses also, under\r\ncertain circumstances, a bleaching property, by which the metallic salts\r\nare restored to their original whiteness after being blackened by\r\nexposure to common daylight, or to the most refrangible rays of the\r\nsolar spectrum.\r\n\r\nPaper prepared with iodide of silver, when washed over with ferrocyanite\r\nof potash, blackens rapidly when exposed to the solar spectrum. It\r\nbegins in the violet rays and extends over all the space occupied by the\r\ndark chemical rays, and over the whole visible spectrum down to the\r\nextreme red rays. This image is coloured, the red rays giving a reddish\r\ntint and the blue a blueish. In a short time a bleaching process begins\r\nunder the red rays, and extends upwards to the green, but the space\r\noccupied by the extreme red is maintained perfectly dark. Mr. Hunt found\r\nthat a similar bleaching power is exerted by the red rays on paper\r\nprepared with protocyanide of potassium and gold with a wash of nitrate\r\nof silver.\r\n\r\nThe application of a moderately strong hydriodate of potash to darkened\r\nphotographic paper renders it peculiarly susceptible of being whitened\r\nby further exposure to light. If paper prepared with bromide of silver\r\nbe washed with ferrocyanate of potash while under the influence of the\r\nsolar spectrum, it is immediately darkened throughout the part exposed\r\nto the visible rays down to the end of the red, some slight interference\r\nbeing perceptible about the region of the orange and yellow. After this\r\na bleaching action begins over the part occupied by the red rays, which\r\nextends to the green. By longer exposure an oval spot begins again to\r\ndarken about the centre of the bleached space; but, if the paper receive\r\nanother wash of the hydriodate of potash, the bleaching action extends\r\nup from the green, over the region occupied by the most refrangible rays\r\nand considerably beyond them, thus inducing a negative action in the\r\nmost refrangible part of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nIn certain circumstances the red rays, instead of restoring darkened\r\nphotographic paper to its original whiteness, produce a deep red colour.\r\nWhen Sir John Herschel received the spectrum on paper somewhat\r\ndiscoloured by exposure to direct sunshine, instead of whiteness, a red\r\nborder was formed extending from the space occupied by the orange, and\r\nnearly covering that on which the red fell. When, instead of exposing\r\nthe paper in the first instance to direct sunshine, it was blackened by\r\nthe violet rays of a prismatic spectrum, or by a sunbeam that had\r\nundergone the absorptive action of a solution of ammonia-sulphate of\r\ncopper, the red rays of the condensed spectrum produced on it, not\r\nwhiteness, but a full and fiery red, which occupied the whole space on\r\nwhich any of the visible red rays had fallen; and this red remained\r\nunchanged, however long the paper remained exposed to the least\r\nrefrangible rays.\r\n\r\nSunlight transmitted through red glass produces the same effect as the\r\nred rays of the spectrum in the foregoing experiment. Sir John Herschel\r\nplaced an engraving over a paper blackened by exposure to sunshine,\r\ncovering the whole with a dark red-brown glass previously ascertained to\r\nabsorb every ray beyond the orange: in this way a photographic copy was\r\nobtained in which the shades were black, as in the original engraving;\r\nbut the lights, instead of being white, were of the red colour of venous\r\nblood, and no other colour could be obtained by exposure to light,\r\nhowever long. Sir John ascertained that every part of the spectrum\r\nimpressed by the more refrangible rays is equally reddened, or nearly\r\nso, by the subsequent action of the less refrangible; thus the red rays\r\nhave the very remarkable property of assimilating to their own colour\r\nthe blackness already impressed on photographic paper.\r\n\r\nThat there is a deoxydating property in the more refrangible rays, and\r\nan oxydating action in the less refrangible part of the spectrum, is\r\nmanifest from the blackening of one and the bleaching effect of the\r\nother; but the peculiar action of the red rays in the experiments\r\nmentioned shows that some other principle exists different from\r\ncontrariety of action. These opposite qualities are balanced or\r\nneutralized in the region of the mean yellow ray. But, although this is\r\nthe general character of the photographic spectrum, under certain\r\ncircumstances even the red rays have a deoxydating power, while the blue\r\nand violet exert a contrary influence; but these are rare exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe photographic action of the two portions of the solar spectrum being\r\nso different, Sir John Herschel tried the effect of their united action\r\nby superposing the less refrangible part of the spectrum over the more\r\nrefrangible portion by means of two prisms; and he thus discovered that\r\ntwo rays of different refrangibility, and therefore of different lengths\r\nof undulation, acting simultaneously, produce an effect which neither,\r\nacting separately, can do.\r\n\r\nSome circumstances that occurred during the analysis of the chemical\r\nspectrum seem to indicate an absorptive action in the sun’s atmosphere.\r\nThe spectral image impressed on paper prepared with nitrate of silver\r\nand Rochelle salt commenced at, or very little below, the mean yellow\r\nray, of a delicate lead colour; and when the action was arrested, such\r\nwas the character of the whole photographic spectrum. But, when the\r\nlight of the solar spectrum was allowed to continue its action, there\r\nwas observed to come on suddenly a new and much more intense impression\r\nof darkness, confined in length to the blue and violet rays; and, what\r\nis most remarkable, confined also in breadth to the middle of the sun’s\r\nimage, so far at least as to leave a border of the lead-coloured\r\nspectrum traceable, not only round the clear and well-defined convexity\r\nof the dark interior spectrum at the less refrangible end, but also\r\nlaterally along both its edges; and this border was the more easily\r\ntraced, and less liable to be mistaken, from its striking contrast of\r\ncolour with the interior spectrum, the former being lead gray, the\r\nlatter an extremely rich deep velvety brown. The less refrangible end of\r\nthis interior brown spectrum presented a sharply terminated and\r\nregularly elliptical contour, the more refrangible a less decided one.\r\n“It may seem too hazardous,” Sir John continues, “to look for the cause\r\nof this very singular phenomenon in a real difference between the\r\nchemical agencies of those rays which issue from the central portion of\r\nthe sun’s disc, and those which, emanating from its borders, have\r\nundergone the absorptive action of a much greater depth of its\r\natmosphere; and yet I confess myself somewhat at a loss what other cause\r\nto assign for it. It must suffice, however, to have thrown out the hint,\r\nremarking only, that I have other, and I am disposed to think decisive,\r\nevidence of the existence of an absorptive solar atmosphere extending\r\nbeyond the luminous one.” M. Arago observed that the rays from the\r\ncentre of the sun have a greater photographic power than those from the\r\nedges, and the photographic images of the sun, taken on glass by M.\r\nNiepcé, were blood-red, much deeper in the centre, and on one occasion\r\nthe image was surrounded by an auriol. Several circumstances concur in\r\nshowing that there are influences also concerned in the transmission of\r\nthe photographic action which have not yet been explained, as, for\r\nexample, the influence which the time of the day exercises on the\r\nrapidity with which photographic impressions are made, the sun being\r\nmuch less effective two hours after passing the meridian than two hours\r\nbefore. There is also reason to suspect that the effect in some way\r\ndepends on the latitude, since a much longer time is required to obtain\r\nan image under the bright skies of the tropics than in England; and it\r\nis even probable that there is a difference in the sun’s light in high\r\nand low latitudes, because an image of the solar spectrum, obtained on a\r\nDaguerreotype plate in Virginia, by Dr. Draper, differed from a spectral\r\nimage obtained by Mr. Hunt on a similar plate in England. The inactive\r\nspaces discovered in the photographic spectrum by M. E. Becquerel,\r\nsimilar to those in the luminous spectrum, and coinciding with them, is\r\nalso a phenomenon of which no explanation has yet been given; possibly\r\nthe chemical rays may be absorbed by the atmosphere with those of light.\r\nAlthough chemical action extends over the whole luminous spectrum, and\r\nmuch beyond it, in gradations of more or less intensity, it is found by\r\ncareful investigation to be by no means continuous; numerous inactive\r\nlines cross it, coinciding with those in the luminous image as far as it\r\nextends; besides, a very great number exist in the portions that are\r\nobscure, and which overlap the visible part. There are three\r\nextraspectral lines beyond the red, and some strongly marked groups on\r\nthe obscure part beyond the violet; but the whole number of those\r\ninactive lines, especially in the dark spaces, is so great that it is\r\nimpossible to count them.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this coincidence in the inactive lines of the two\r\nspectra, photographic energy is independent of both light and heat,\r\nsince it exerts the most powerful influence in those rays where they are\r\nleast, and also in spaces where neither sensibly exist; but the\r\ntransmission of the sun’s light through coloured media makes that\r\nindependence quite evident. Heat and light pass abundantly through\r\nyellow glass, or a solution of chromate of potash; but the greater part\r\nof the chemical rays are excluded, and chlorine gas diluted with common\r\nair, though highly pervious to the luminous and calorific principles,\r\nhas the same effect. Sir John Herschel found that a slight degree of\r\nyellow London fog had a similar effect with that of pale yellow media:\r\nhe also remarked that a weak solution of azolitmine in potash, which\r\nadmits a great quantity of green light, excludes chemical action; and\r\nsome years ago the author, while making experiments on the transmission\r\nof chemical rays, observed that green glass, coloured by oxide of copper\r\nabout the 20th of an inch thick, excludes the photographic rays; and, as\r\nM. Melloni has shown that substance to be impervious to the most\r\nrefrangible calorific rays, it has the property of excluding the whole\r\nof the most refrangible part of the solar spectrum, visible and\r\ninvisible. Green mica, if not too thin, has also the same effect,\r\nwhereas amethyst, deep blue, and violet-coloured glasses, though they\r\ntransmit a very little light, allow the chemical rays to pass freely.\r\nThus light and photographic energy may be regarded as distinct parts of\r\nthe solar beam, and both being propagated by vibrations of the etherial\r\nmedium they are merely motion. Excellent images have been obtained of\r\nthe moon in its different phases by Professor Secchi, at Rome;\r\ncandlelight is nearly deficient of the chemical rays. How far they may\r\ninfluence crystallization and other molecular arrangements is unknown,\r\nbut their power is universal wherever the solar beam falls, although\r\ntheir effect only becomes evident in cases of unstable molecular\r\nequilibrium.\r\n\r\nIt is not by vision alone that a knowledge of the sun’s rays is\r\nacquired: touch proves that they have the power of raising the\r\ntemperature of substances exposed to their action. Sir William Herschel\r\ndiscovered that rays which produce the sensation of heat exist in the\r\nsolar spectrum independent of those of light; when he used a prism of\r\nflint glass, he found that the warm rays are most abundant in the dark\r\nspace a little beyond the red extremity of the spectrum, that from\r\nthence they decrease towards the violet, beyond which they are\r\ninsensible. It may be concluded therefore, that the calorific rays vary\r\nin refrangibility, and that those beyond the extreme red are less\r\nrefrangible than any rays of light. Since Sir William Herschel’s time it\r\nhas been discovered that the calorific spectrum exceeds the luminous one\r\nin length in the ratio of 42 to 25, but the most singular phenomenon is\r\nits want of continuity. Sir John Herschel blackened the under side of a\r\nsheet of very thin white paper by the smoke of a lamp, and, having\r\nexposed the white side to the solar spectrum, he drew a brush dipped in\r\nspirit of wine over it, by which the paper assumed a black hue when\r\nsufficiently saturated. The heat in the spectrum evaporated the spirit\r\nfirst on those parts of the paper where it fell with greatest intensity,\r\nthereby restoring their white colour, and he thus discovered that the\r\nheat increases uniformly and gradually throughout the luminous spectrum,\r\nand that it comes to a maximum and forms a spot at a considerable\r\ndistance beyond the extreme red. It then decreases, but again increasing\r\nit forms a second maximum spot, after which it ceases altogether through\r\na short space, but is again renewed and forms two more insulated spots,\r\nand even a fifth may be traced at a little distance from the latter.\r\nThese circumstances are probably owing to the absorbing action of the\r\natmospheres of the sun and earth. “The effect of the former,” says Sir\r\nJohn, “is beyond our control, unless we could carry our experiments to\r\nsuch a point of delicacy as to operate separately on rays emanating from\r\nthe centre and borders of the sun’s disc; that of the earth’s, though it\r\ncannot be eliminated any more than in the case of the sun’s, may yet be\r\nvaried to a considerable extent by experiments made at great elevations,\r\nunder a vertical sun, and compared with others where the sun is more\r\noblique, the situation lower, and the atmospheric pressure of a\r\ntemporarily high amount. Should it be found that this cause is in\r\nreality concerned in the production of the spots, we should see reason\r\nto believe that a large portion of solar heat never reaches the earth’s\r\nsurface, and that what is incident on the summits of lofty mountains\r\ndiffers not only in quantity but also in quality from what the plains\r\nreceive.”\r\n\r\nA remarkable phosphorescent property was discovered by M. E. Becquerel\r\nin the solar spectrum. Two luminous bands separated by a dark one are\r\nexcited by the solar spectrum on paper covered with a solution of gum\r\narabic, and strewed with powdered sulphuret of calcium or Canton’s\r\nphosphorus. One of the luminous bands occupies the space under the least\r\nrefrangible violet rays, and the other that beyond the lavender rays, so\r\nthat the dark band lies under the extreme violet and lavender rays. When\r\nthe action of the light is continued, the whole surface beyond the least\r\nrefrangible violet shines, the luminous bands already mentioned\r\nbrightest; but all the space from the least refrangible violet to the\r\nextreme red remains dark. If the surface, prepared either with the\r\nsulphuret of calcium or Bologna stone, be exposed to the sun’s light for\r\na little time, it becomes luminous all over; but when, in this state, a\r\nsolar spectrum is thrown upon it, the whole remains luminous except the\r\npart from the least refrangible violet to the extreme red, on which\r\nspace the light is extinguished; and when the temperature of the surface\r\nis raised by a lamp, the bright parts become more luminous and the dark\r\nparts remain dark. Glass stained by the protoxide of copper, which\r\ntransmits only the red and orange rays, has the same effect with the\r\nless refrangible part of the spectrum; hence there can be no doubt that\r\nthe most refrangible and obscure rays of the spectrum excite\r\nphosphorescence, while all the less refrangible rays of light and heat\r\nextinguish it.\r\n\r\nPaper prepared with the sulphuret of barium, when under the solar\r\nspectrum, shows only one space of maximum luminous intensity, and the\r\ndestroying rays are the same as in the sulphuret of calcium. Thus the\r\nobscure rays beyond the extreme violet produce light, while the luminous\r\nrays extinguish it.\r\n\r\nThe phosphoric spectrum has inactive lines which coincide with those in\r\nthe luminous and chemical spectra, at least as far as it extends; but in\r\norder to be seen the spectrum must be received for a few seconds upon\r\nthe prepared surface through an aperture in a dark room, then the\r\naperture must be closed, and the temperature of the surface raised two\r\nor three hundred degrees; the phosphorescent parts then shine\r\nbrilliantly and the dark lines appear black. Since the parts of similar\r\nrefrangibility in different spectra are traversed by the same dark\r\nlines, rays of the same refrangibility are probably absorbed at the same\r\ntime by the different media through which they pass.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the experiments of MM. Becquerel and Biot, that\r\nelectrical disturbances produce these phosphorescent effects. There is\r\nthus a mysterious connexion between the most refrangible rays and\r\nelectricity which the experiments of M. E. Becquerel confirm, showing\r\nthat electricity is developed during chemical action by the violet rays,\r\nthat it is feebly developed by the blue and indigo, but that none is\r\nexcited by the less refrangible part of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nA series of experiments by Sir John Herschel have disclosed a new set of\r\nobscure rays in the solar spectrum, which seem to bear the same relation\r\nto those of heat that the photographic or chemical rays bear to the\r\nluminous. They are situate in that part of the spectrum which is\r\noccupied by the less refrangible visible colours, and have been named by\r\ntheir discoverer Parathermic rays. It must be held in remembrance that\r\nthe region of greatest heat in the solar spectrum lies in the dark space\r\nbeyond the visible red. Now, Sir John Herschel found that in experiments\r\nwith a solution of gum guaiacum in soda, which gives the paper a green\r\ncolour, the green, yellow, orange, and red rays of the spectrum\r\ninvariably discharged the colour, while no effect was produced by the\r\nextra-spectral rays of heat, which ought to have had the greatest effect\r\nhad heat been the cause of the phenomenon. When an aqueous solution of\r\nchlorine was poured over a slip of paper prepared with gum guaiacum\r\ndissolved in soda, a colour varying from a deep somewhat greenish hue to\r\na fine celestial blue was given to it; and, when the solar spectrum was\r\nthrown on the paper while moist, the colour was discharged from all the\r\nspace under the less refrangible luminous rays, at the same time that\r\nthe more distant thermic rays beyond the spectrum evaporated the\r\nmoisture from the space on which they fell; so that the heat spots\r\nbecame apparent. But the spots disappeared as the paper dried, leaving\r\nthe surface unchanged; while the photographic impression within the\r\nvisible spectrum increased in intensity; the non-luminous thermic rays,\r\nthough evidently active _as to heat_, were yet incapable of effecting\r\nthat peculiar chemical change which other rays of much less heating\r\npower were all the time producing. Sir John having ascertained that an\r\nartificial heat from 180° to 280° of Fahrenheit changed the green tint\r\nof gum guaiacum to its original yellow hue when moist, but that it had\r\nno effect when dry, he therefore tried whether heat from a hot iron\r\napplied to the back of the paper used in the last-mentioned experiment\r\nwhile under the influence of the solar spectrum might not assist the\r\naction of the calorific rays; but, instead of doing so, it greatly\r\naccelerated the discoloration over the spaces occupied by the less\r\nrefrangible rays, but had no effect on the extra-spectral region of\r\nmaximum heat. Obscure terrestrial heat, therefore, is capable of\r\nassisting and being assisted in effecting this peculiar change by those\r\nrays of the spectrum, whether luminous or thermic, which occupy its red,\r\nyellow, and green regions; while, on the other hand, it receives no such\r\nassistance from the purely thermic rays beyond the spectrum acting under\r\nsimilar circumstances and in an equal state of condensation.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions drawn from these experiments are confirmed by that which\r\nfollows: a photographic picture formed on paper prepared with a mixture\r\nof the solutions of ammonia-citrate of iron and ferro-sesquicyanite of\r\npotash in equal parts, then thrown into water and afterwards dried, will\r\nbe blue and negative, that is to say, the lights and shadows will be the\r\nreverse of what they are in nature. If in this state the paper be washed\r\nwith a solution of proto-nitrate of mercury, the picture will be\r\ndischarged; but if it be well washed and dried, and a hot smoothing-iron\r\npassed over it, the picture instantly reappears, not blue, but brown; if\r\nkept some weeks in this state in perfect darkness between the leaves of\r\na portfolio, it fades, and almost entirely vanishes, but a fresh\r\napplication of heat restores it to its full original intensity. This\r\ncurious change is not the effect of light, at least not of light alone.\r\nA certain temperature must be attained, and that suffices in total\r\ndarkness; yet, on exposing to a very concentrated spectrum a slip of the\r\npaper used in the last experiment, after the uniform blue colour has\r\nbeen discharged and a white ground left, this whiteness is changed to\r\nbrown over the whole region of the red and orange rays, _but not beyond_\r\nthe luminous spectrum.\r\n\r\nSir John thence concludes:—1st. That it is the heat of these rays, not\r\ntheir light, which operates the change; 2ndly. That this heat possesses\r\na peculiar chemical quality which is not possessed by the purely\r\ncalorific rays outside of the visible spectrum, though far more intense;\r\nand, 3rdly. That the heat radiated from obscurely hot iron abounds\r\nespecially in rays analogous to those of the region of the spectrum\r\nabove indicated.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of these singular transformations may be noticed. The\r\npictures formed on cyanotype paper rendered more sensitive by the\r\naddition of corrosive sublimate are blue on a white ground and positive,\r\nthat is, the lights and shadows are the same as in nature, but, by the\r\napplication of heat, the colour is changed from blue to brown, from\r\npositive to negative; even by keeping in darkness the blue colour is\r\nrestored, as well as the _positive character_. Sir John attributes this,\r\nas in the former instance, to certain rays, which, regarded as rays of\r\nheat or light, or of some influence _sui generis_ accompanying the red\r\nand orange rays of the spectrum, are also copiously emitted by bodies\r\nheated short of redness. He thinks it probable that these invisible\r\nparathermic rays are the rays which radiate from molecule to molecule in\r\nthe interior of bodies, that they determine the discharge of vegetable\r\ncolours at the boiling temperature, and also the innumerable atomic\r\ntransformations of organic bodies which take place at the temperature\r\nbelow redness, that they are distinct from those of pure heat, and that\r\nthey are sufficiently identified by these characters to become\r\nlegitimate objects of scientific discussion.\r\n\r\nThe calorific and parathermic rays appear to be intimately connected\r\nwith the discoveries of Messrs. Draper and Moser. Daguerre has shown\r\nthat the action of light on the iodide of silver renders it capable of\r\ncondensing the vapour of mercury which adheres to the parts affected by\r\nit. Professor Moser of Königsberg has proved that the same effect is\r\nproduced by the simple contact of bodies, and even by their very near\r\njuxtaposition, and that in total darkness as well as in light. This\r\ndiscovery he announced in the following words:—“If a surface has been\r\ntouched in any particular parts by any body, it acquires the property of\r\nprecipitating all vapours, and these adhere to it or combine chemically\r\nwith it on these spots differently from what they do on the untouched\r\nparts.” If we write on a plate of glass or any smooth surface whatever\r\nwith blotting-paper, a brush, or anything else, and then clean it, the\r\ncharacters always reappear if the plate or surface be breathed upon, and\r\nthe same effect may be produced even on the surface of mercury; nor is\r\nabsolute contact necessary. If a screen cut in a pattern be held over a\r\npolished metallic surface at a small distance, and the whole breathed\r\non, after the vapour has evaporated so that no trace is left on the\r\nsurface, the pattern comes out when it is breathed on again.\r\n\r\nProfessor Moser proved that bodies exert a very decided influence upon\r\neach other, by placing coins, cut stones, pieces of horn, and other\r\nsubstances, for a short time on a warm metallic plate: when the\r\nsubstance was removed, no impression appeared on the plate till it was\r\nbreathed upon or exposed to the vapour of mercury, and then these\r\nvapours adhered only to the parts where the substance had been placed,\r\nmaking distinct images, which in some cases were permanent after the\r\nvapour was removed. Similar impressions were obtained on glass and other\r\nsubstances even when the bodies were not in contact, and the results\r\nwere the same whether the experiments were performed in light or in\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nMr. Grove found, when plates of zinc and copper were closely\r\napproximated, but not in contact, and suddenly separated, that one was\r\npositively and the other negatively electric; whence he inferred that\r\nthe intervening medium was either polarised, or that a radiation\r\nanalogous, if not identical, with that which produces Moser’s images\r\ntakes place from plate to plate.\r\n\r\nMr. Hunt has shown that many of these phenomena depend on difference of\r\ntemperature, and that, in order to obtain good impressions, dissimilar\r\nmetals must be used. For example, gold, silver, bronze, and copper coins\r\nwere placed on a plate of copper too hot to be touched, and allowed to\r\nremain till the plate cooled: all the coins had made an impression, the\r\ndistinctness and intensity of which were in the order of the metals\r\nnamed. When the plate was exposed to the vapour of mercury the result\r\nwas the same, but, when the vapour was wiped off, the gold and silver\r\ncoins only had left permanent images on the copper. These impressions\r\nare often minutely perfect, whether the coins are in actual contact with\r\nthe plate or one-eighth of an inch above it. The mass of the metal has a\r\nmaterial influence on the result; a large copper coin makes a better\r\nimpression on a copper plate than a small silver coin. When coins of\r\ndifferent metals are placed on the same plate they interfere with each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nWhen, instead of being heated, the copper plate was cooled by a freezing\r\nmixture, and bad conductors of heat laid upon it, as wood, paper, glass,\r\n&c., the result was similar.\r\n\r\nMr. Hunt, observing that a black substance leaves a stronger impression\r\non a metallic surface than a white, applied the property to the art of\r\ncopying prints, woodcuts, writing, and printing, on copper amalgamated\r\non one surface and highly polished, merely by placing the object to be\r\ncopied smoothly on the metal, and pressing it into close contact by a\r\nplate of glass: after some hours the plate is subjected to the vapour of\r\nmercury, and afterwards to that of iodine, when a black and accurate\r\nimpression of the object comes out on a grey ground. Effects similar to\r\nthose attributed to heat may also be produced by electricity. Mr.\r\nKarsten, by placing a glass plate upon one of metal, and on the glass\r\nplate a medal subjected to discharges of electricity, found a perfect\r\nimage of the medal impressed on the glass, which could be brought into\r\nevidence by either mercury or iodine; and, when several plates of glass\r\nwere interposed between the medal and the metallic plate, each plate of\r\nglass received an image on its upper surface after the passage of\r\nelectrical discharges. These discharges have the remarkable power of\r\nrestoring impressions that have been long obliterated from plates by\r\npolishing—a proof that the disturbances upon which these phenomena\r\ndepend are not confined to the surface of the metals, but that a very\r\ndecided molecular change has taken place to a considerable depth. Mr.\r\nHunt’s experiments prove that the electro-negative metals make the most\r\ndecided images upon electro-negative plates, and _vice versâ_. M.\r\nMatteucci has shown that a discharge of electricity does not visibly\r\naffect a polished silver plate, but that it produces an alteration which\r\nrenders it capable of condensing vapour.\r\n\r\nThe impression of an engraving was made by laying it face downwards on a\r\nsilver plate iodized, and placing an amalgamated copper plate upon it;\r\nit was left in darkness fifteen hours, during which time an impression\r\nof the engraving had been made on the amalgamated plate _through the\r\npaper_.\r\n\r\nAn iodized silver plate was placed in darkness with a coil of string\r\nlaid on it, and with a polished silver plate suspended one-eighth of an\r\ninch above it: after four hours they were exposed to the vapours of\r\nmercury, which became uniformly deposited on the iodized plate, but on\r\nthe silver one there was a sharp image of the string, so that this image\r\nwas formed in the dark, and even without contact. Coins or other objects\r\nleave their impressions in the same manner with perfect sharpness and\r\naccuracy, when brought out by vapour without contact, in darkness, and\r\non simple metals.\r\n\r\nRed and orange coloured media, smoked glass, and all bodies that\r\ntransmit or absorb the hot rays freely, leave strong impressions on a\r\nplate of copper, whether they be in contact or one-eighth of an inch\r\nabove it. Heat must be concerned in this, for a solar spectrum\r\nconcentrated by a lens was thrown on a polished plate of copper, and\r\nkept on the same spot by a heliostat for two or three hours: when\r\nexposed to mercurial vapour, a film of the vapour covered the plate\r\nwhere the diffused light which always accompanies the solar spectrum had\r\nfallen. On the obscure space occupied by the maximum heating power of\r\nSir William Herschel, and also on the great heat spot in the thermic\r\nspectrum of Sir John Herschel, the condensation of the mercury was so\r\nthick that it stood out a distinct white spot on the plate, while over\r\nthe whole space that had been under the visible spectrum the quantity of\r\nvapour was much less than that which covered the other parts, affording\r\ndistinct evidence of a negative effect in the luminous spectrum and of\r\nthe power of the hot rays, which is not always confined to the surface\r\nof the metal, since in many instances the impressions penetrated to a\r\nconsiderable depth below it, and consequently were permanent.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these singular effects appear to be owing to the mutual\r\naction of molecules in contact while in a different state, whether of\r\nelectricity or temperature: others clearly point at some unknown\r\ninfluence exerted between surfaces at a distance, and affecting their\r\nmolecular structure: possibly it may be the parathermic rays, which have\r\na peculiar chemical action even in total darkness. In the last\r\nexperiment the effect is certainly produced by the positive portion of\r\none of those remarkable antagonist principles which characterise the\r\nsolar spectrum.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that the prism resolves the pure white sunbeam into\r\nthree superposed spectra, each varying in refrangibility and intensity\r\nthroughout its whole length; the visible part is overlapped at one end\r\nby the chemical or photographic rays, and at the other by the thermic,\r\nbut the two latter so much exceed the visible part, that the linear\r\ndimensions of the three—the luminous, thermic, and photographic—are in\r\nproportion to the numbers 25, 42·10, and 55·10, so that the whole solar\r\nspectrum is twice as long as its visible part. The two extremities exert\r\na decided antagonist energy. The least refrangible luminous rays\r\nobliterate the action of the photographic rays, while the latter produce\r\nphosphorescent light, which is extinguished by the least refrangible\r\nluminous rays. According to Mr. Hunt’s experiment, the hot rays condense\r\nmercurial vapour on a polished metallic plate, while the luminous rays\r\nprevent its formation. Electricity is excited by the chemical rays,\r\nwhile the parathermic are found in the less refrangible rays alone. Each\r\nof the spectra is crossed by coloured and rayless lines peculiar to\r\nitself, and these are traversed at right angles by innumerable dark\r\nlines of various breadths, the whole forming an inexpressibly wonderful\r\nand glorious creation.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement varies a little according to the material of the prism\r\nand the manner of producing the spectrum, as in that obtained by\r\nProfessor Draper from diffracted light. It was formed by a beam\r\ndiffracted by passing through a netting of fine wire, or by reflection\r\nfrom a polished surface of steel, having fine parallel lines drawn on\r\nit. This diffracted spectrum is divided into two equal parts in the\r\ncentre of the yellow; and as in the prismatic spectrum, one half is\r\nantagonist to the other half, the red or negative end undoing what the\r\npositive or violet end has done. The centre of the yellow is the hottest\r\npart, and the heat decreases to both extremities. A line of cold is\r\nsupposed to exist on this spectrum answering to Fraunhofer’s dark line\r\nH.\r\n\r\nThe undulations of the ethereal medium which constitute a sunbeam must\r\nbe infinitely varied, each influence having a vibration peculiar to\r\nitself. Those of light are certainly transverse to the direction of the\r\nray; while Professor Draper believes that those of heat are normal, that\r\nis, in the direction of the ray, like those of sound. A doubt exists\r\nwhether the vibrations of polarised light are perpendicular to the plane\r\nof polarisation or in that plane. Professor Stokes of Cambridge has come\r\nto the conclusion, both from the diffracted spectrum and theory, that\r\nthey are perpendicular to the plane of polarisation, but M. Holtzmann is\r\nof opinion that they are in that plane, so the subject is still open to\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION XXV.\r\n\r\nSize and Constitution of the Sun—The Solar Spots—Intensity of the\r\n  Sun’s Light and Heat—The Sun’s Atmosphere—His influence on the\r\n  Planets—Atmospheres of the Planets—The Moon has none—Lunar\r\n  heat—The Differential Telescope—Temperature of Space—Internal\r\n  Heat of the Earth—Zone of constant Temperature—Increase of Heat\r\n  With the Depth—Central Heat—Volcanic Action—Quantity of Heat\r\n  received from the Sun—Isogeothermal Lines—Line of perpetual\r\n  Congelation—Climate—Isothermal Lines—Same quantity of Heat\r\n  annually received and radiated by the Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE sun is a globe 880,000 miles in diameter: what his body may be it is\r\nimpossible to conjecture, but it seems to be a dark mass surrounded by\r\nan extensive atmosphere at a certain height in which there is a stratum\r\nof luminous clouds which constitutes the photosphere of the sun. Above\r\nit rises the true solar atmosphere, visible as an aureola or corona\r\nduring annular and total eclipses, and probably the cause of the\r\npeculiar phenomena in the photographic image of the sun already\r\nmentioned. Through occasional openings in the photosphere or mottled\r\nocean of flame, the dark nucleus appears like black spots, often of\r\nenormous size. These spots are almost always comprised within a zone of\r\nthe sun’s surface, whose breadth measured on a solar meridian does not\r\nextend beyond 30-1/2° on each side of his equator, though they have been\r\nseen at a distance of 39-1/2°. The dark central part of the spots is\r\nsurrounded by a succession of obscure cloudy envelopes increasing in\r\nbrightness up to a penumbra, sometimes there are three or more shades,\r\nbut it requires a good telescope to distinguish the intermediate ones.\r\nThe spots gradually increase in size and number from year to year to a\r\nmaximum, and then as gradually decrease to a minimum, accomplishing\r\nregular vicissitudes in periods of about eleven years, and are\r\nsingularly connected with the cycles of terrestrial magnetism. From\r\ntheir extensive and rapid changes, there is every reason to believe that\r\nthe exterior and incandescent part of the sun is gaseous.\r\n\r\nDoubts have arisen as to the uniformity of the quantity of heat emitted\r\nby the sun. Sir William Herschel was the first to suspect that it was\r\naffected by the quantity and magnitude of the spots on his surface;\r\nProfessor Secchi has observed that the spots are less hot than the\r\nluminous part; and now Professor Wolf has perceived that the amount of\r\nheat emitted by the sun varies periodically with the spots every 11·11\r\nyears, or nearly nine times in a century, beginning at the commencement\r\nof the present one. He has discovered a sub-period in that of the spots,\r\nwhich no doubt has an effect on the quantity of solar heat. So the\r\nunaccountable vicissitudes in the temperature of different years may\r\nultimately be found to depend upon the constitution of the sun himself.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the sun’s light diminishes from the centre to the\r\ncircumference of the solar disc. His direct light has been estimated to\r\nbe equal to that of 5563 wax candles of moderate size placed at the\r\ndistance of one foot from an object; that of the moon is probably only\r\nequal to the light of one candle at the distance of 12 feet:\r\nconsequently the light of the sun is more than three hundred thousand\r\ntimes greater than that of the moon. According to Professor Secchi’s\r\nexperiments at Rome, the heat of the solar image is almost twice as\r\ngreat at the centre as at the edge. The maximum heat, however, is not in\r\nthe centre, but in the solar equator, and the spots are less hot than\r\nthe rest of the surface.\r\n\r\nThe oceans of light and heat probably arising from electric or chemical\r\nprocesses of immense energy that continually take place at the sun’s\r\nsurface (N. 217) are transmitted in undulations by the ethereal medium\r\nin all directions; but notwithstanding the sun’s magnitude and the\r\ninconceivable intensity of light and heat that must exist at his\r\nsurface, as the intensity of both diminishes as the square of the\r\ndistance increases, his kindly influence can hardly be felt at the\r\nboundaries of our system. In Uranus the sun must be seen like a small\r\nbrilliant star not above the hundred and fiftieth part as bright as he\r\nappears to us, but that is 2000 times brighter than our moon, so that he\r\nis really a sun to Uranus, and may impart some degree of warmth. But if\r\nwe consider that water would not remain fluid in any part of Mars, even\r\nat his equator, and that, in the temperate zones of the same planet,\r\neven alcohol and quicksilver would freeze, we may form some idea of the\r\ncold that must reign in Uranus and Neptune. The climate of Venus more\r\nnearly resembles that of the earth, though, excepting at her poles, much\r\ntoo hot for animal and vegetable life such as they exist here, for she\r\nreceives seven times as much light and heat as the earth does; but in\r\nMercury the mean heat from the intensity of the sun’s rays must be above\r\nthat of boiling quicksilver, and water would boil even at his poles.\r\nThus the planets, though kindred with the earth in motion and form, are,\r\naccording to our experience, totally unfit for the habitation of such a\r\nbeing as man, unless indeed their temperature should be modified by\r\ncircumstances of which we are not aware, and which may increase or\r\ndiminish the sensible heat so as to render them habitable. In our utter\r\nignorance it may be observed, that the earth, if visible at all from\r\nNeptune, can only be a minute telescopic object; that from the nearest\r\nfixed star the sun must dwindle to a mere point of light; that the whole\r\nsolar system would there be hid by a spider’s thread; and that the\r\nstarry firmament itself is only the first series of starry systems, the\r\nnumbers of which are bounded alone by the imperfection of our\r\nspace-penetrating instruments. In this overwhelming majesty of creation,\r\nit seems rash to affirm that the earth alone is inhabited by intelligent\r\nbeings, and thus to limit the Omnipotent, who has made nothing in vain.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the planets have extensive and dense atmospheres: according\r\nto Schroëter the atmosphere of Ceres is more than 668 miles high, and\r\nthat of Pallas has an elevation of 465 miles, but not a trace of an\r\natmosphere can be perceived round Vesta. The attraction of the earth has\r\nprobably deprived the moon of hers, for the refractive power of the air\r\nat the surface of the earth is at least a thousand times as great as at\r\nthe surface of the moon: the lunar atmosphere must therefore be of a\r\ngreater degree of rarity than can be produced by our best air-pumps.\r\nThis is confirmed by Arago’s observations during a solar eclipse, when\r\nno trace of a lunar atmosphere could be seen. Since then, however, some\r\nindications of air have been perceived in the lunar valleys. In taking\r\nphotographic images of the moon and Jupiter at Rome, Professor Secchi\r\nfound that the light of the full moon is to that of the quarter moon as\r\n3 to 1. Jupiter gives a photographic image as bright and vigorous as the\r\nbrightest part of the moon; but although the light of Jupiter is less\r\nthan that of the moon, he is nearly five times farther from the sun; and\r\nas light diminishes as the square of the distance increases, the light\r\nof Jupiter is proportionally greater than that of the moon, consequently\r\nJupiter’s atmosphere reflects more light than the dark volcanic soil of\r\nthe moon; thus Professor Secchi observes photography may in time reveal\r\nthe quality of the materials of which the celestial bodies are formed.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the earth’s atmosphere on lunar heat is remarkable.\r\nProfessor Forbes proved that the direct light of the full moon is\r\nincapable of raising a thermometer the one three thousandth part of a\r\nCentigrade degree, at least in England; but at an elevation of 8870 feet\r\non the Peak of Teneriffe, Mr. Piazzi Smyth found a very sensible heat\r\nfrom the moon, although she was then 19° south of the equator; so it is\r\nno doubt absorbed by our atmosphere at lower levels.\r\n\r\nSome exceedingly interesting experiments might be made by means of a\r\ntelescope having a prism attached to its objective extremity, and\r\nfurnished with a micrometer, because by it the difference of the\r\nillumination of objects might be determined with extreme accuracy—as for\r\nexample, the comparative intensity between the bright and dark parts of\r\nthe moon, the comparative intensity of the solar light reflected by the\r\nmoon, and the lumière cendré, or the light of the earth reflected on the\r\nmoon, whence a comparison might be made between the light of the sun and\r\nthat of the earth. Hence also it might be known whether the terrestrial\r\nhemispheres successively visible from the moon are more or less\r\nluminous, according as they contain more land or water, and at the same\r\ntime it might be possible to appreciate the more or less cloudy or clear\r\nstate of our atmosphere, so that in time we might ultimately find in the\r\nlumière cendré of the moon data upon the mean diaphaneity of different\r\nterrestrial hemispheres which are of different temperatures.\r\n\r\nIt is found by experience that heat is developed in opaque and\r\ntranslucent substances by their absorption of solar light, but that the\r\nsun’s rays do not sensibly alter the temperature of perfectly\r\ntransparent bodies through which they pass. As the temperature of the\r\npellucid planetary space can be but little affected by the passage of\r\nthe sun’s light and heat, neither can it be sensibly raised by the heat\r\nnow radiated from the earth.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the radiation of all the bodies in the universe maintains the\r\nethereal medium at a higher temperature than it would otherwise have,\r\nand must eventually increase it, but by a quantity so evanescent that it\r\nis hardly possible to conceive a time when a change will become\r\nperceptible.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of space being so low as -239° Fahrenheit, it becomes a\r\nmatter of no small interest to ascertain whether the earth may not be\r\nultimately reduced by radiation to the temperature of the surrounding\r\nmedium; what the sources of heat are; and whether they be sufficient to\r\ncompensate the loss, and to maintain the earth in a state fit for the\r\nsupport of animal and vegetable life in time to come. All observations\r\nthat have been made under the surface of the ground concur in proving\r\nthat there is a stratum at the depth of from 40 to 100 feet throughout\r\nthe whole earth where the temperature is invariable at all times and\r\nseasons, and which differs but little from the mean annual temperature\r\nof the country above. According to M. Boussingault, that stratum at the\r\nequator is at the depth of little more than a foot in places sheltered\r\nfrom the direct rays of the sun; but in our climates it is at a much\r\ngreater depth. In the course of more than half a century the temperature\r\nof the earth at the depth of 90 feet, in the cellars of the Observatory\r\nat Paris, has never been above or below 53° of Fahrenheit’s thermometer,\r\nwhich is only 2° above the mean annual temperature at Paris. This zone,\r\nunaffected by the sun’s rays from above, or by the internal heat from\r\nbelow, serves as an origin whence the effects of the external heat are\r\nestimated on one side, and the internal temperature of the globe on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAs early as the year 1740 M. Gensanne discovered in the lead-mines of\r\nGiromagny, in the Vosges mountains, three leagues from Béfort, that the\r\nheat of the ground increases with the depth below the zone of constant\r\ntemperature. A vast number of observations have been made since that\r\ntime, in the mines of Europe and America, by MM. Saussure, Daubuisson,\r\nHumboldt, Cordier, Fox, Reich, and others, which agree, without an\r\nexception, in proving that the temperature of the earth becomes higher\r\nin descending towards its centre. The greatest depth that has been\r\nattained is in the silver-mine of Guanaxato, in Mexico, where M. de\r\nHumboldt found a temperature of 98° at the depth of 285 fathoms, the\r\nmean annual temperature of the country being only 61°. Next to that is\r\nthe Dalcoath copper-mine, in Cornwall, where Mr. Fox’s thermometer stood\r\nat 68° in a hole in the rock at the depth of 230 fathoms, and at 82° in\r\nwater at the depth of 240 fathoms, the mean annual temperature at the\r\nsurface being about 50°. But it is needless to multiply examples, all of\r\nwhich concur in showing that there is a very great difference between\r\nthe temperature in the interior of the earth and at its surface. Mr.\r\nFox’s observations on the temperature of springs which rise at profound\r\ndepths in mines afford the strongest testimony. He found considerable\r\nstreams flowing into some of the Cornish mines at the temperature of 80°\r\nor 90°, which is about 30° or 40° above that of the surface, and also\r\nascertained that nearly 2,000,000 gallons of water are daily pumped from\r\nthe bottom of the Poldice mine, which is 176 fathoms deep at 90° or\r\n100°. As this is higher than the warmth of the human body, Mr. Fox\r\njustly observes that it amounts to a proof that the increased\r\ntemperature cannot proceed from the persons of the workmen employed in\r\nthe mines. Neither can the warmth of mines be attributed to the\r\ncondensation of the currents of air which ventilate them. Mr. Fox, whose\r\nopinion is of high authority in these matters, states that, even in the\r\ndeepest mines, the condensation of the air would not raise the\r\ntemperature more than 5° or 6°; and that, if the heat could be\r\nattributed to this cause, the seasons would sensibly affect the\r\ntemperature of mines, which it appears they do not where the depth is\r\ngreat. Besides, the Cornish mines are generally ventilated by numerous\r\nshafts opening into the galleries from the surface or from a higher\r\nlevel. The air circulates freely in these, descending in some shafts and\r\nascending in others. In all cases Mr. Fox found that the upward currents\r\nare of a higher temperature than the descending currents; so much so,\r\nthat in winter the moisture is often frozen in the latter to a\r\nconsiderable depth; the circulation of air, therefore, tends to cool the\r\nmine instead of increasing the heat. Mr. Fox has also removed the\r\nobjections arising from the comparatively low temperature of the water\r\nin the shafts of abandoned mines, by showing that observations in them,\r\nfrom a variety of circumstances which he enumerates, are too discordant\r\nto furnish any conclusion as to the actual heat of the earth. The high\r\ntemperature of mines might be attributed to the effects of the fires,\r\ncandles, and gunpowder used by the miners, did not a similar increase\r\nobtain in deep wells, and in borings to great depths in search of water,\r\nwhere no such causes of disturbance occur. In a well dug with a view to\r\ndiscover salt in the canton of Berne, and long deserted, M. de Saussure\r\nhad the most complete evidence of increasing heat. The same has been\r\nconfirmed by the temperature of many wells, both in France and England,\r\nespecially by the Artesian wells, so named from a peculiar method of\r\nraising water first resorted to in Artois, and since become very\r\ngeneral. An Artesian well consists of a shaft a few inches in diameter,\r\nbored into the earth till a spring is found. To prevent the water being\r\ncarried off by the adjacent strata, a tube is let down which exactly\r\nfills the bore from top to bottom, in which the water rises pure to the\r\nsurface. It is clear the water could not rise unless it had previously\r\ndescended from high ground through the interior of the earth to the\r\nbottom of the well. It partakes of the temperature of the strata through\r\nwhich it passes, and in every instance has been warmer in proportion to\r\nthe depth of the well; but it is evident that the law of increase cannot\r\nbe obtained in this manner. Perhaps the most satisfactory experiments on\r\nrecord are those made by MM. Auguste de la Rive and F. Marcet during the\r\nyear 1833, in a boring for water about a league from Geneva, at a place\r\n318 feet above the level of the lake. The depth of the bore was 727\r\nfeet, and the diameter only between four and five inches. No spring was\r\never found; but the shaft filled with mud, from the moisture of the\r\nground mixing with the earth displaced in boring, which was peculiarly\r\nfavourable for the experiments, as the temperature at each depth may be\r\nconsidered to be that of the particular stratum. In this case, where\r\nnone of the ordinary causes of disturbance could exist, and where every\r\nprecaution was employed by scientific and experienced observers, the\r\ntemperature was found to increase regularly and uniformly with the depth\r\nat the rate of about 1° of Fahrenheit for every 52 feet. Professor Reich\r\nof Freyberg has found that the mean of a great number of observations\r\nboth in mines and wells is 1° of Fahrenheit for every 55 feet of depth;\r\nand from M. Arago’s observations in the Grenelle Artesian well at Paris,\r\nthe increase is 1° of Fahrenheit for every 45 feet. Though there can be\r\nno doubt as to the increase of temperature in penetrating the crust of\r\nthe earth, there is still much uncertainty as to the law of increase,\r\nwhich varies with the nature of the soil and other local circumstances;\r\nbut, on an average, it has been estimated at the rate of 1° for every 50\r\nor 60 feet, which corresponds with the observations of MM. Marcet and De\r\nla Rive. In consequence of the rapid increase of internal heat, thermal\r\nsprings, or such as are independent of volcanic action, rising from a\r\ngreat depth, must necessarily be very rare and of a high temperature;\r\nand it is actually found that none are so low as 68° of Fahrenheit; that\r\nof Chaudes Aigues, in Auvergne, is about 136°. In many places warm water\r\nfrom Artesian wells will probably come into use for domestic purposes,\r\nand it is even now employed in manufactories near Stutgardt, in Alsace,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly to be expected that at present any information with regard\r\nto the actual internal temperature of the earth should be obtained from\r\nthat of the ocean, on account of the mobility of fluids, by which the\r\ncolder masses sink downwards, while those that are warmer rise to the\r\nsurface. Nevertheless, it may be stated that the temperature of the sea\r\ndecreases with the depth between the tropics; while, on the contrary,\r\nall our northern navigators found that the temperature increases with\r\nthe depth in the polar seas. The change takes place about the 70th\r\nparallel of latitude. Some ages hence, however, it may be known whether\r\nthe earth has arrived at a permanent state as to heat, by comparing\r\nsecular observations of the temperature of the ocean if made at a great\r\ndistance from the land.\r\n\r\nShould the earth’s temperature increase at the rate of 1° for every 50\r\nfeet, it is clear that at the depth of 200 miles the hardest substances\r\nmust be in a state of fusion, and our globe must in that case either be\r\nencompassed by a stratum of melted lava at that depth, or it must be a\r\nball of liquid fire 7600 miles in diameter, enclosed in a thin coating\r\nof solid matter; for 200 miles are nothing when compared with the size\r\nof the earth. No doubt the form of the earth, as determined by the\r\npendulum and arcs of the meridian, as well as by the motions of the\r\nmoon, indicates original fluidity and subsequent consolidation and\r\nreduction of temperature by radiation; but whether the law of increasing\r\ntemperature is uniform at still greater depths than those already\r\nattained by man, it is impossible to say. At all events, internal\r\nfluidity is not inconsistent with the present state of the earth’s\r\nsurface, since earthy matter is as bad a conductor of heat as lava,\r\nwhich often retains its heat at a very little depth for years after its\r\nsurface is cool. Whatever the radiation of the earth might have been in\r\nformer times, certain it is that it goes on very slowly in our days; for\r\nM. Fourier has computed that the central heat is decreasing from\r\nradiation by only about the 1/30000th part of a degree in a century. If\r\nso, there can be no doubt that it will ultimately be dissipated; but as\r\nfar as regards animal and vegetable life, it is of very little\r\nconsequence whether the centre of our planet be liquid fire or ice,\r\nsince its condition in either case could have no sensible effect on the\r\nclimate at its surface. The internal fire does not even impart heat\r\nenough to melt the snow at the poles, though nearer to the centre than\r\nany other part of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe immense extent of active volcanic fire is one of the causes of heat\r\nwhich must not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe range of the Andes from Chile to the north of Mexico, probably from\r\nCape Horn to Behring Straits, is one vast district of igneous action,\r\nincluding the Caribbean and the West Indian Islands on one hand; and\r\nstretching quite across the Pacific Ocean, through the Polynesian\r\nArchipelago, the New Hebrides, the Georgian and Friendly Islands, on the\r\nother. Another chain begins with the Aleutian Islands, extends to\r\nKamtschatka, and from thence passes through the Kurile, Japanese, and\r\nPhilippine Islands, to the Moluccas, whence it spreads with terrific\r\nviolence through the Indian Archipelago, even to the Bay of Bengal.\r\nVolcanic action may again be followed from the entrance of the Persian\r\nGulf to Madagascar, Bourbon, the Canaries, and Azores. Thence a\r\ncontinuous igneous region extends through about 1000 geographical miles\r\nto the Caspian Sea, including the Mediterranean, and extending north and\r\nsouth between the 35th and 40th parallels of latitude; and in central\r\nAsia a volcanic region occupies 2500 square geographical miles. The\r\nvolcanic fires are developed in Iceland in tremendous force; and the\r\nantarctic land discovered by Sir James Ross is an igneous formation of\r\nthe boldest structure, where a volcano in high activity rises 12,000\r\nfeet above the perpetual ice of these polar deserts, and within 19-1/2°\r\nof the south pole. Throughout this vast portion of the world the\r\nsubterraneous fire is often intensely active, producing such violent\r\nearthquakes and eruptions that their effects, accumulated during\r\nmillions of years, may account for many of the great geological changes\r\nof igneous origin that have already taken place in the earth, and may\r\noccasion others not less remarkable, should time—that essential element\r\nin the vicissitudes of the globe—be granted, and their energy last.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell, who has shown the power of existing causes with great\r\ningenuity, estimates that on an average twenty eruptions take place\r\nannually in different parts of the world; and many must occur or have\r\nhappened, even on the most extensive and awful scale, among people\r\nequally incapable of estimating their effects and of recording them. We\r\nshould never have known the extent of the fearful eruption which took\r\nplace in the island of Sumbawa, in 1815, but for the accident of Sir\r\nStamford Raffles having been governor of Java at the time. It began on\r\nthe 5th of April, and did not entirely cease till July. The ground was\r\nshaken through an area of 1000 miles in circumference; the tremors were\r\nfelt in Java, the Moluccas, a great part of Celebes, Sumatra, and\r\nBorneo. The detonations were heard in Sumatra, at the distance of 970\r\ngeographical miles in a straight line; and at Ternate, 720 miles in the\r\nopposite direction. The most dreadful whirlwinds carried men and cattle\r\ninto the air; and with the exception of 26 persons, the whole population\r\nof the island perished to the amount of 12,000. Ashes were carried 300\r\nmiles to Java in such quantities that the darkness during the day was\r\nmore profound than ever had been witnessed in the most obscure night.\r\nThe face of the country was changed by the streams of lava, and by the\r\nupheaving and sinking of the soil. The town of Tomboro was submerged,\r\nand water stood to the depth of 18 feet in places which had been dry\r\nland. Ships grounded where they had previously anchored, and others\r\ncould hardly penetrate the mass of cinders which floated on the surface\r\nof the sea for several miles to the depth of two feet. A catastrophe\r\nsimilar to this, though of less magnitude, took place in the island of\r\nBali in 1808, which was not heard of in Europe till years afterwards.\r\nThe eruption of Coseguina in the Bay of Fonseca, which began on the 19th\r\nof January, 1835, and lasted many days, was even more dreadful and\r\nextensive in its effects than that of Sumbawa. The ashes during this\r\neruption were carried by the upper current of the atmosphere as far\r\nnorth as Chiassa, which is upwards of 400 leagues to the windward of\r\nthat volcano. Many volcanoes supposed to be extinct have all at once\r\nburst out with inconceivable violence. Witness Vesuvius, on historical\r\nrecord; and the volcano in the island of St. Vincent in our own days,\r\nwhose crater was lined with large trees, and which had not been active\r\nin the memory of man. Vast tracts are of volcanic origin where volcanoes\r\nhave ceased to exist for ages. Whence it may be inferred that in some\r\nplaces the subterraneous fires are in the highest state of activity, in\r\nsome they are inert, and in others they appear to be extinct. Yet there\r\nare few countries that are not subject to earthquakes of greater or less\r\nintensity; the tremors are propagated like a sonorous undulation to such\r\ndistances that it is impossible to say in what point they originate. In\r\nsome recent instances their power must have been tremendous. In South\r\nAmerica, so lately as 1822, an area of 100,000 square miles, which is\r\nequal in extent to the half of France, was raised several feet above its\r\npresent level—a most able account of which is given in the ‘Transactions\r\nof the Geological Society,’ by an esteemed friend of the author’s, the\r\nlate Mrs. Graham, who was present during the whole time of that\r\nformidable earthquake, which recurred at short intervals for more than\r\ntwo months, and who possessed talents to appreciate, and had\r\nopportunities of observing, its effects under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances at Valparaiso, and for miles along the coast where it was\r\nmost intense. A considerable elevation of the land has again taken place\r\nalong the coast of Chile, in consequence of the violent earthquake which\r\nhappened on the 20th of February, 1835. In 1819 a ridge of land\r\nstretching for 50 miles across the delta of the Indus, 16 feet broad,\r\nwas raised 10 feet above the plain. The reader is referred to Sir\r\nCharles Lyell’s excellent ‘Principles of Geology,’ already mentioned,\r\nfor most interesting details of the phenomena and extensive effects of\r\nvolcanoes and earthquakes, too numerous to find a place here. It may\r\nhowever be mentioned that innumerable earthquakes are from time to time\r\nshaking the solid crust of the globe, and carrying destruction to\r\ndistant regions, progressively though slowly accomplishing the great\r\nwork of change. A most disastrous instance took place on the 15th of\r\nDecember, 1857, in the Neapolitan provinces of La Basilicata and\r\nPrincipato Citeriore, where the destruction was extensive and terrible;\r\nthe number of victims, according to the official accounts, being\r\nreturned at upwards of ten thousand. These terrible engines of ruin,\r\nfitful and uncertain as they may seem, must, like all durable phenomena,\r\nhave a law which may in time be discovered by long-continued and\r\naccurate observations.\r\n\r\nThe shell of volcanic fire that girds the globe at a small depth below\r\nour feet has been attributed to different causes. By some it is supposed\r\nto originate in an ocean of incandescent matter, still existing in the\r\ncentral abyss of the earth. Some conceive it to be superficial, and due\r\nto chemical action, in strata at no very great depth when compared with\r\nthe size of the globe. The more so as matter on a most extensive scale\r\nis passing from old into new combinations, which, if rapidly effected,\r\nare capable of producing the most intense heat. According to others,\r\nelectricity, which is so universally diffused in all its forms\r\nthroughout the earth, if not the immediate cause of the volcanic\r\nphenomena, at least determines the chemical affinities that produce\r\nthem. It is clear that a subject so involved in mystery must give rise\r\nto much speculation, in which every hypothesis is attended with\r\ndifficulties that observation alone can remove.\r\n\r\nBut the views of Mr. Babbage and Sir John Herschel on the general cause\r\nof volcanic action, and the changes in the equilibrium of the internal\r\nheat of the globe, accord more with the laws of mechanics and radiant\r\nheat than any that have been proposed. The theory of these distinguished\r\nphilosophers, formed independently of each other, is equally consistent\r\nwith observed phenomena, whether the earth be a solid crust encompassing\r\na nucleus of liquid lava, or that there is merely a vast reservoir or\r\nstratum of melted matter at a moderate depth below the superficial\r\ncrust. The author is indebted to the kindness of Sir Charles Lyell for\r\nthe perusal of a most interesting letter from Sir John Herschel, in\r\nwhich he states his views on the subject.\r\n\r\nSupposing that the globe is merely a solid crust, resting upon fluid or\r\nsemi-fluid matter, whether extending to the centre or not, the transfer\r\nof pressure from one part of its surface to another by the degradation\r\nof existing continents, and the formation of new ones, would be\r\nsufficient to subvert the equilibrium of heat in the interior, and\r\noccasion volcanic eruptions. For, since the internal heat of the earth\r\nis transmitted outwards by radiation, an accession of new matter on any\r\npart of the surface, like an addition of clothing, by keeping it in,\r\nwould raise the temperature of the strata below, and in the course of\r\nages would even reduce those at a great depth to a state of fusion. Some\r\nof the substances might be converted into gases; and should the\r\naccumulation of new matter take place at the bottom of the sea, as is\r\ngenerally the case, this lava would be mixed with water in a state of\r\nignition in consequence of the enormous pressure of the ocean, and of\r\nthe newly superimposed matter which would prevent it from expanding into\r\nsteam. Now Sir Charles Lyell has shown, with his usual talent, that the\r\nquantity of matter carried down by rivers from the surface of the\r\ncontinents is comparatively trifling, and that the great transfer to the\r\nbottom of the ocean is produced at the coast-line by the action of the\r\nsea; hence, says Sir John Herschel, “the greatest accumulation of local\r\npressure is in the central area of the deep sea, while the greatest\r\nlocal relief takes place along the abraded coast-lines. Here then should\r\noccur the chief volcanic vents.” As the crust of the earth is much\r\nweaker on the coasts than elsewhere, it is more easily ruptured, and, as\r\nMr. Babbage observes, immense rents might be produced there by its\r\ncontraction in cooling down after being deprived of a portion of its\r\noriginal thickness. The pressure on the bottom of the ocean would force\r\na column of lava mixed with ignited water and gas to rise through an\r\nopening thus formed, and, says Sir John Herschel, “when the column\r\nattains such a height that the ignited water can become steam, the joint\r\nspecific gravity of the column is suddenly diminished, and up comes a\r\njet of mixed steam and lava, till so much has escaped that the matter\r\ndeposited at the bottom of the ocean takes a fresh bearing, when the\r\nevacuation ceases and the crack becomes sealed up.”\r\n\r\nThis theory perfectly accords with the phenomena of nature, since there\r\nare very few active volcanoes at a distance from the sea, and the\r\nexceptions that do occur are generally near lakes, or they are connected\r\nwith volcanoes on the maritime coasts. Many break out even in the bottom\r\nof the ocean, probably owing to some of the supports of the superficial\r\ncrust giving way, so that the steam and lava are forced up through the\r\nfissures.\r\n\r\nFinally, Mr. Babbage observes that, “in consequence of changes\r\ncontinually going on, by the destruction of forests, the filling up of\r\nseas, the wearing down of elevated lands, the heat radiated from the\r\nearth’s surface varies considerably at different periods. In consequence\r\nof this variation, and also in consequence of the covering up of the\r\nbottom of the sea by the detritus of the land, the surfaces of equal\r\ntemperature within the earth are continually changing their form, and\r\nexposing thick beds near the exterior to alterations of temperature. The\r\nexpansion and contraction of these strata may form rents and veins,\r\nproduce earthquakes, determine volcanic eruptions, elevate continents,\r\nand, possibly, raise mountain chains.”\r\n\r\nThe numerous vents for the internal heat formed by volcanoes, hot\r\nsprings, and the emission of steam, so frequent in volcanic regions, no\r\ndoubt maintain the tranquillity of the interior fluid mass, which seems\r\nto be perfectly inert unless when put in motion by unequal pressure.\r\n\r\nBut, to whatever cause the increasing heat of the earth and the\r\nsubterranean fires may ultimately be referred, it is certain that,\r\nexcept in some local instances, they have no sensible effect on the\r\ntemperature of its surface. It may therefore be concluded that the heat\r\nof the earth, above the zone of uniform temperature, is entirely owing\r\nto the sun.\r\n\r\nThe power of the solar rays depends much upon the manner in which they\r\nfall, as we readily perceive from the different climates on our globe.\r\nAlthough the sun is about three millions of miles nearer to the earth in\r\nwinter than in summer, his rays strike the atmosphere in the northern\r\nhemisphere so obliquely that it absorbs a much greater quantity of heat\r\nthan when they are more direct (N. 217). Indeed it is so great that,\r\nwhen the sun has an altitude of 30°, one half of his heat is absorbed by\r\nthe atmosphere, and it increases very rapidly as he sinks towards the\r\nhorizon. However, that heat is not lost: it is most beneficial to the\r\nearth, being really the heat which supplies the greatest part of that\r\nwhich is radiated into space during the absence of the sun. Professor\r\nDove has shown, by taking at all seasons the mean of the temperatures of\r\npoints on the earth’s surface diametrically opposite to each other, that\r\nthe average temperature of the whole earth’s surface in June, when we\r\nare farthest from the sun, considerably exceeds that in December, when\r\nwe are nearest to him, owing to the excess of water in the southern\r\nhemisphere, and that of land in the northern, which gives a general\r\ninsular climate to the former, and a continental climate to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe observations of the north polar navigators, and those of Sir John\r\nHerschel at the Cape of Good Hope, show that the direct heating\r\ninfluence of the solar rays is greatest at the equator, and that it\r\ndiminishes gradually as the latitude increases. At the equator the\r\nmaximum is 48-3/4°, while in Europe it has never exceeded 29-1/2°.\r\n\r\nM. Pouillet has estimated with singular ingenuity, from a series of\r\nobservations made by himself, that the whole quantity of heat which the\r\nearth receives annually from the sun is such as would be sufficient to\r\nmelt a stratum of ice covering the whole globe 46 feet deep. Part of\r\nthis heat is radiated back into space; but by far the greater part\r\ndescends into the earth during the summer, towards the zone of uniform\r\ntemperature, whence it returns to the surface in the course of the\r\nwinter, and tempers the cold of the ground and the atmosphere in its\r\npassage to the ethereal regions, where it is lost, or rather where it\r\ncombines with the radiation from the other bodies of the universe in\r\nmaintaining the temperature of space. The sun’s power being greatest\r\nbetween the tropics, the heat sinks deeper there than elsewhere, and the\r\ndepth gradually diminishes towards the poles; but the heat is also\r\ntransmitted laterally from the warmer to the colder strata north and\r\nsouth of the equator, and aids in tempering the severity of the polar\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nThe mean heat of the earth, above the stratum of constant temperature,\r\nis determined from that of springs; and, if the spring be on elevated\r\nground, the temperature is reduced by computation to what it would be at\r\nthe level of the sea, assuming that the heat of the soil varies\r\naccording to the same law as the heat of the atmosphere, which is about\r\n1° of Fahrenheit’s thermometer for every 333·7 feet. From a comparison\r\nof the temperature of numerous springs with that of the air, Sir David\r\nBrewster concludes that there is a particular line passing nearly\r\nthrough Berlin, at which the temperature of springs and that of the\r\natmosphere coincide; that in approaching the arctic circle the\r\ntemperature of springs is always higher than that of the air, while,\r\nproceeding towards the equator, it is lower.\r\n\r\nSince the warmth of the superficial strata of the earth decreases from\r\nthe equator to the poles, there are many places in both hemispheres\r\nwhere the ground has the same mean temperature. If lines were drawn\r\nthrough all those points in the upper strata of the globe which have the\r\nsame mean annual temperature, they would be nearly parallel to the\r\nequator between the tropics, and would become more and more irregular\r\nand sinuous towards the poles. These are called isogeothermal lines. A\r\nvariety of local circumstances disturb their parallelism, even between\r\nthe tropics.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the ground at the equator is lower on the coasts and\r\nislands than in the interior of continents; the warmest part is in the\r\ninterior of Africa; but it is obviously affected by the nature of the\r\nsoil, especially if it be volcanic.\r\n\r\nMuch has been done to ascertain the manner in which heat is distributed\r\nover the surface of our planet, and the variations of climate, which, in\r\na general view, mean every change of the atmosphere, such as of\r\ntemperature, humidity, variations of barometric pressure, purity of air,\r\nthe serenity of the heavens, the effects of winds, and electric tension.\r\nTemperature depends upon the property which all bodies possess, more or\r\nless, of perpetually absorbing and emitting or radiating heat. When the\r\ninterchange is equal, the temperature of a body remains the same; but,\r\nwhen the radiation exceeds the absorption, it becomes colder, and _vice\r\nversâ_. In order to determine the distribution of heat over the surface\r\nof the earth, it is necessary to find a standard by which the\r\ntemperature in different latitudes may be compared. For that purpose it\r\nis requisite to ascertain, by experiment, the mean temperature of the\r\nday, of the month, and of the year, at as many places as possible\r\nthroughout the earth. The annual average temperature may be found by\r\nadding the mean temperatures of all the months in the year, and dividing\r\nthe sum by twelve. The average of ten or fifteen years will give it\r\napproximately; for, although the temperature in any place maybe subject\r\nto very great variations, yet it never deviates more than a few degrees\r\nfrom its mean state, which consequently offers a good standard of\r\ncomparison. As a standard, however, much greater accuracy is required.\r\n\r\nIf climate depended solely upon the heat of the sun, all places having\r\nthe same latitude would have the same mean annual temperature. The\r\nmotion of the sun in the ecliptic, indeed, occasions perpetual\r\nvariations in the length of the day, and in the direction of the rays\r\nwith regard to the earth; yet, as the cause is periodic, the mean annual\r\ntemperature from the sun’s motion alone must be constant in each\r\nparallel of latitude; for it is evident that the accumulation of heat in\r\nthe long days of summer, which is but little diminished by radiation\r\nduring the short nights, is balanced by the small quantity of heat\r\nreceived during the short days in winter, and its radiation in the long,\r\nfrosty, and clear nights. In fact, if the globe were everywhere on a\r\nlevel with the surface of the sea, and of uniform substance, so as to\r\nabsorb and radiate heat equally, the mean heat of the sun would be\r\nregularly distributed over its surface in zones of equal annual\r\ntemperature parallel to the equator, from which it would decrease to\r\neach pole as the square of the cosine of the latitude; and its quantity\r\nwould only depend upon the altitude of the sun and atmospheric currents.\r\nThe distribution of heat, however, in the same parallel, is very\r\nirregular in all latitudes except between the tropics, where the\r\nisothermal lines, or the lines passing through places of equal mean\r\nannual temperature, are more nearly parallel to the equator. The causes\r\nof disturbance are very numerous; but such as have the greatest\r\ninfluence, according to M. de Humboldt, to whom we are indebted for the\r\ngreater part of what is known on the subject, are the elevation of the\r\ncontinents, the distribution of land and water over the surface of the\r\nglobe exposing different absorbing and radiating powers; the variations\r\nin the surface of the land, as forests, sandy deserts, verdant plains,\r\nrocks, &c.; mountain-chains covered with masses of snow, which diminish\r\nthe temperature; the reverberation of the sun’s rays in the valleys,\r\nwhich increases it; and the interchange of currents, both of air and\r\nwater, which mitigates the rigour of climates; the warm currents from\r\nthe equator softening the severity of the polar frosts, and the cold\r\ncurrents from the poles tempering the intense heat of the equatorial\r\nregions. To these may be added cultivation, though its influence extends\r\nover but a small portion of the globe, only a fourth part of the land\r\nbeing inhabited.\r\n\r\nTemperature decreases with the height above the level of the sea, as\r\nwell as with the latitude. The air in the higher regions of the\r\natmosphere is much cooler than that below, because the warm air expands\r\nas it rises, by which its capacity for heat is increased, a great\r\nproportion becomes latent or absorbed, and less of it sensible. A\r\nportion of air at the surface of the earth whose temperature is 70° of\r\nFahrenheit, if carried to the height of two miles and a half, would\r\nexpand so much that its temperature would be reduced 50°; and in the\r\nethereal regions the temperature is 239° below the zero point of\r\nFahrenheit.\r\n\r\nThe height at which snow lies perpetually decreases from the equator to\r\nthe poles, and is higher in summer than in winter; but it varies from\r\nmany circumstances. Snow rarely falls when the cold is intense and the\r\natmosphere dry. Extensive forests produce moisture by their evaporation;\r\nand high table-lands, on the contrary, dry and warm the air, because the\r\nair at great elevations is too rare to absorb much of the sun’s heat. In\r\nthe Cordilleras of the Andes, plains of only twenty-five square leagues\r\nfrom their extent raise the temperature as much as 3° or 4° above what\r\nis found at the same altitude on the rapid declivity of a mountain,\r\nconsequently the line of perpetual snow varies according as one or other\r\nof these causes prevails. Aspect in general has also a great influence;\r\nyet the line of perpetual snow is much higher on the northern than on\r\nthe southern side of the Himalaya, partly because the air is nearly\r\ndeprived of its moisture by precipitation before it arrives at the\r\nnorthern side of the mountains. On the whole, it appears that the mean\r\nheight between the tropics at which the snow lies perpetually is about\r\n15,207 feet above the level of the sea; whereas snow does not cover the\r\nground continually at the level of the ocean till near the north pole.\r\nIn the southern hemisphere, however, the cold is greater than in the\r\nnorthern. In Sandwich Land, between the 54th and 58th degrees of\r\nlatitude, perpetual snow and ice extend to the sea-level; and in the\r\nisland of S. Georgia, in the 53rd degree of south latitude, which\r\ncorresponds with the latitude of the central counties of England,\r\nperpetual snow descends even to the level of the ocean. It has been\r\nshown that this excess of cold in the southern hemisphere cannot be\r\nattributed to the winter being longer than ours by 7-3/4 days. It is\r\nprobably owing to the open sea surrounding the south pole, which permits\r\nthe icebergs to descend to a lower latitude by 10° than they do in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, on account of the numerous obstructions opposed to\r\nthem by the islands and continents about the north pole. Icebergs from\r\nthe Arctic seas seldom float farther to the south than the Azores;\r\nwhereas those that come from the south pole descend to as low a latitude\r\nas that of the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nThe influence of mountain-chains does not wholly depend upon the line of\r\nperpetual congelation. They attract and condense the vapours floating in\r\nthe air, and send them down in torrents of rain. They radiate heat into\r\nthe atmosphere at a lower elevation, and increase the temperature of the\r\nvalleys by the reflection of the sun’s rays, and by the shelter they\r\nafford against prevailing winds. But, on the contrary, one of the most\r\ngeneral and powerful causes of cold arising from the vicinity of\r\nmountains is the freezing currents of wind which rush from their lofty\r\npeaks along the rapid declivities, chilling the surrounding valleys:\r\nsuch is the cutting north wind called the bise in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nNext to elevation, the difference in the radiating and absorbing powers\r\nof the sea and land has the greatest influence in disturbing the regular\r\ndistribution of heat. The extent of the dry land is not above the fourth\r\npart of that of the ocean; so that the general temperature of the\r\natmosphere, regarded as the result of the partial temperatures of the\r\nwhole surface of the globe, is most powerfully modified by the sea.\r\nBesides, the ocean acts more uniformly on the atmosphere than the\r\ndiversified surface of the solid mass does, both by the equality of its\r\ncurvature and its homogeneity. In opaque substances the accumulation of\r\nheat is confined to the stratum nearest the surface. The seas become\r\nless heated at their surface than the land, because the solar rays,\r\nbefore being extinguished, penetrate the transparent liquid to a greater\r\ndepth and in greater numbers than in the opaque masses. On the other\r\nhand, water has a considerable radiating power, which, together with\r\nevaporation, would reduce the surface of the ocean to a very low\r\ntemperature, if the cold particles did not sink to the bottom on account\r\nof their superior density. The seas preserve a considerable portion of\r\nthe heat they receive in summer, and from their saltness do not freeze\r\nso soon as fresh water. So that, in consequence of all these\r\ncircumstances, the ocean is not subject to such variations of heat as\r\nthe land, and, by imparting its temperature to the winds and by its\r\ncurrents, it diminishes the rigour of climate on the coasts and in the\r\nislands, which are never subject to such extremes of heat and cold as\r\nare experienced in the interior of continents, though they are liable to\r\nfogs and rain from the evaporation of the adjacent seas. On each side of\r\nthe equator to the 48th degree of latitude, the surface of the ocean is\r\nin general warmer than the air above it. The mean of the difference of\r\nthe temperature at noon and midnight is about 1°·37, the greatest\r\ndeviation never exceeding from 0°·36 to 2°·16, which is much cooler than\r\nthe air over the land.\r\n\r\nOn land the temperature depends upon the nature of the soil and its\r\nproducts, its habitual moisture or dryness. From the eastern extremity\r\nof the Sahara desert quite across Africa, the soil is almost entirely\r\nbarren sand; and the Sahara desert itself extends over an area of\r\n194,000 square leagues, equal to twice the area of the Mediterranean\r\nSea, and raises the temperature of the air by radiation from 90° to\r\n100°, which must have a most extensive influence. On the contrary,\r\nvegetation cools the air by evaporation and the apparent radiation of\r\ncold from the leaves of plants, because they absorb more caloric than\r\nthey give out. The graminiferous plains of South America cover an extent\r\nten times greater than France, occupying no less than about 50,000\r\nsquare leagues, which is more than the whole chain of the Andes, and all\r\nthe scattered mountain-groups of Brazil. These, together with the plains\r\nof North America and the steppes of Europe and Asia, must have an\r\nextensive cooling effect on the atmosphere if it be considered that in\r\ncalm and serene nights they cause the thermometer to descend 12° or 14°,\r\nand that in the meadows and heaths in England the absorption of heat by\r\nthe grass is sufficient to cause the temperature to sink to the point of\r\ncongelation during the night for ten months in the year. Forests cool\r\nthe air also by shading the ground from the rays of the sun, and by\r\nevaporation from the boughs. Hales found that the leaves of a single\r\nplant of helianthus three feet high exposed nearly forty feet of\r\nsurface; and, if it be considered that the woody regions of the river\r\nAmazons, and the higher part of the Orinoco, occupy an area of 260,000\r\nsquare leagues, some idea may be formed of the torrents of vapour which\r\nrise from the leaves of the forests all over the globe. However, the\r\nfrigorific effects of their evaporation are counteracted in some measure\r\nby the perfect calm which reigns in the tropical wildernesses. The\r\ninnumerable rivers, lakes, pools, and marshes interspersed through the\r\ncontinents absorb caloric, and cool the air by evaporation; but, on\r\naccount of the chilled and dense particles sinking to the bottom, deep\r\nwater diminishes the cold of winter, so long as ice is not formed.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the difference in the radiating and absorbing powers\r\nof the sea and land, their configuration greatly modifies the\r\ndistribution of heat over the surface of the globe. Under the equator\r\nonly one-sixth part of the circumference is land; and the superficial\r\nextent of land in the northern and southern hemispheres is in the\r\nproportion of three to one. The effect of this unequal division is\r\ngreater in the temperate than in the torrid zones, for the area of land\r\nin the northern temperate zone is to that in the southern as thirteen to\r\none, whereas the proportion of land between the equator and each tropic\r\nis as five to four. It is a curious fact, noticed by Mr. Gardner, that\r\nonly one twenty-seventh part of the land of the globe has land\r\ndiametrically opposite to it. This disproportionate arrangement of the\r\nsolid part of the globe has a powerful influence on the temperature of\r\nthe southern hemisphere. But, besides these greater modifications, the\r\npeninsulas, promontories, and capes, running out into the ocean,\r\ntogether with bays and internal seas, all affect temperature. To these\r\nmay be added the position of continental masses with regard to the\r\ncardinal points. All these diversities of land and water influence\r\ntemperature by the agency of the winds. On this account the temperature\r\nis lower on the eastern coasts both of the New and Old World than on the\r\nwestern; for, considering Europe as an island, the general temperature\r\nis mild in proportion as the aspect is open to the Atlantic Ocean, the\r\nsuperficial temperature of which, as far north as the 45th and 50th\r\ndegrees of latitude, does not fall below 48° or 51° of Fahrenheit, even\r\nin the middle of winter. On the contrary, the cold of Russia arises from\r\nits exposure to the northern and eastern winds. But the European part of\r\nthat empire has a less rigorous climate than the Asiatic, because it\r\ndoes not extend to so high a latitude.\r\n\r\nThe interposition of the atmosphere modifies all the effects of the\r\nsun’s heat. The earth communicates its temperature so slowly, that M.\r\nArago has occasionally found as much as from 14° to 18° of difference\r\nbetween the heat of the soil and that of the air two or three inches\r\nabove it.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which have been enumerated, and many more, concur in\r\ndisturbing the regular distribution of heat over the globe, and occasion\r\nnumberless local irregularities. Nevertheless the mean annual\r\ntemperature becomes gradually lower from the equator to the poles. But\r\nthe diminution of mean heat is most rapid between the 40th and 45th\r\ndegrees of latitude both in Europe and America, which accords perfectly\r\nwith theory; whence it appears that the variation in the square of the\r\ncosine of the latitude (N. 127), which expresses the law of the change\r\nof temperature, is a maximum towards the 45th degree of latitude. The\r\nmean annual temperature under the equator in America is about 81-1/2° of\r\nFahrenheit: in Africa it is said to be nearly 83°. The difference\r\nprobably arises from the winds of Siberia and Canada, whose chilly\r\ninfluence is sensibly felt in Asia and America, even within 18° of the\r\nequator.\r\n\r\nThe isothermal lines are nearly parallel to the equator, till about the\r\n22nd degree of latitude on each side of it, where they begin to lose\r\ntheir parallelism, and continue to do so more and more as the latitude\r\naugments. With regard to the northern hemisphere, the isothermal line of\r\n59° of Fahrenheit passes between Rome and Florence in latitude 43°; and\r\nnear Raleigh in North Carolina, latitude 36°: that of 50° of equal\r\nannual temperature runs through the Netherlands, latitude 51°; and near\r\nBoston in the United States, latitude 42-1/2°: that of 41° passes near\r\nStockholm, latitude 59-1/2°; and St. George’s Bay, Newfoundland,\r\nlatitude 48°: and lastly, the line of 32°, the freezing point of water,\r\npasses between Ulea in Lapland, latitude 66°, and Table Bay, on the\r\ncoast of Labrador, latitude 54°.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that the isothermal lines, which are nearly parallel to\r\nthe equator for about 22°, afterwards deviate more and more. From\r\nobservations made during the numerous voyages in the Arctic Seas, it is\r\nfound that the isothermal lines of Europe and America entirely separate\r\nin the high latitudes, and surround two poles of maximum cold: one, in\r\n79° N. lat. and 120° E. long., has a mean temperature of 2° Fahrenheit;\r\nand the other, whose temperature was determined by Sir David Brewster to\r\nbe 3-1/2° Fahrenheit, from the observations of Sir Edward Parry is near\r\nMelville Island. The pole of the earth’s rotation, whose mean\r\ntemperature is probably not below 15° Fahrenheit, is nearly midway\r\nbetween the two; and the line which joins these points of maximum cold\r\nis almost coincident with that diameter of the polar basin which bisects\r\nit, and passes through its two great outlets into the Pacific and\r\nAtlantic Oceans, a most remarkable feature, and strongly indicative of\r\nthe absence of land, and of the prevalence of a materially milder\r\nclimate in the polar Ocean, probably not under 15° Fahrenheit.[12] It is\r\nbelieved that two corresponding poles of maximum cold exist in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, though observations are wanting to trace the course\r\nof the southern isothermal lines with the same accuracy as the northern.\r\n\r\nThe isothermal lines, or such as pass through places where the mean\r\nannual temperature of the air is the same, do not always coincide with\r\nthe isogeothermal lines, which are those passing through places where\r\nthe mean temperature of the ground is the same. Sir David Brewster, in\r\ndiscussing this subject, finds that the isogeothermal lines are always\r\nparallel to the isothermal lines; consequently the same general formula\r\nwill serve to determine both, since the difference is a constant\r\nquantity obtained by observation, and depending upon the distance of the\r\nplace from the neutral isothermal line. These results are confirmed by\r\nthe observations of M. Kupffer of Kasan during his excursions to the\r\nnorth, which show that the European and the American portions of the\r\nisogeothermal line of 32° of Fahrenheit actually separate, and go round\r\nthe two poles of maximum cold. This traveller remarked, also, that the\r\ntemperature both of the air and of the soil decreases most rapidly\r\ntowards the 45th degree of latitude.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that places may have the same mean annual temperature, and\r\nyet differ materially in climate. In one, the winters may be mild and\r\nthe summers cool; whereas another may experience the extremes of heat\r\nand cold. Lines passing through places having the same mean summer or\r\nwinter temperature are neither parallel to the isothermal, the\r\ngeothermal lines, nor to one another, and they differ still more from\r\nthe parallels of latitude. In Europe, the latitude of two places which\r\nhave the same annual heat never differs more than 8° or 9°; whereas the\r\ndifference in the latitude of those having the same mean winter\r\ntemperature is sometimes as much as 18° or 19°. At Kasan, in the\r\ninterior of Russia, in latitude 55°·48, nearly the same with that of\r\nEdinburgh, the mean annual temperature is about 37°·6; at Edinburgh it\r\nis 47°·84. At Kasan the mean summer temperature is 64°·84, and that of\r\nwinter 2°·12; whereas at Edinburgh the mean summer temperature is\r\n58°·28, and that of winter 38°·66. Whence it appears that the difference\r\nof winter temperature is much greater than that of summer. At Quebec the\r\nsummers are as warm as those in Paris, and grapes sometimes ripen in the\r\nopen air: whereas the winters are as severe as in Petersburgh; the snow\r\nlies five feet deep for several months, wheel carriages cannot be used,\r\nthe ice is too hard for skating, travelling is performed in sledges, and\r\nfrequently on the ice of the river St. Lawrence. The cold at Melville\r\nIsland on the 15th of January, 1820, according to Sir Edward Parry, was\r\n55° below the zero of Fahrenheit’s thermometer; and when Dr. Kane was on\r\nthe northern coast of Greenland it was 70° below that point; yet the\r\nsummer heat during the day in these high latitudes is insupportable.\r\n\r\nObservations tend to prove that all the climates of the earth are\r\nstable, and that their vicissitudes are only periods or oscillations of\r\nmore or less extent, which vanish in the mean annual temperature of a\r\nsufficient number of years. This constancy of the mean annual\r\ntemperature of the different places on the surface of the globe shows\r\nthat the same quantity of heat which is annually received by the earth\r\nis annually radiated into space; and that would be the case even if the\r\nquantity of heat emitted by the sun should vary with his spots, for, if\r\nmore were received, more would be radiated. Nevertheless, a variety of\r\ncauses may disturb the climate of a place; cultivation may make it\r\nwarmer; but it is at the expense of some other place, which becomes\r\ncolder in the same proportion. There may be a succession of cold summers\r\nand mild winters, but in some other country the contrary takes place to\r\neffect the compensation; wind, rain, snow, fog, and the other meteoric\r\nphenomena, are the ministers employed to accomplish the changes. The\r\ndistribution of heat may vary with a variety of circumstances; but the\r\nabsolute quantity lost and gained by the whole earth in the course of a\r\nyear, if not invariably the same, is at least periodical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION XXVI.\r\n\r\nInfluence of Temperature on Vegetation—Vegetation varies with the\r\n  Latitude and Height above the Sea—Geographical Distribution of Land\r\n  Plants—Distribution of Marine Plants—Corallines, Shell-fish, Reptiles,\r\n  Insects, Birds, and Quadrupeds—Varieties of Mankind, yet identity of\r\n  Species.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE gradual decrease of temperature in the air and in the earth, from\r\nthe equator to the poles, is clearly indicated by its influence on\r\nvegetation. In the valleys of the torrid zone, where the mean annual\r\ntemperature is very high, and where there is abundance of light and\r\nmoisture, nature adorns the soil with all the luxuriance of perpetual\r\nsummer. The palm, the bombax ceiba, and a variety of magnificent trees,\r\ntower to the height of 150 or 200 feet above the banana, the bamboo, the\r\narborescent fern, and numberless other tropical productions, so\r\ninterlaced by creeping and parasitical plants, as often to present an\r\nimpenetrable barrier. But the richness of vegetation gradually\r\ndiminishes with the temperature; the splendour of the tropical forest is\r\nsucceeded by the regions of the vine and olive; these again yield to the\r\nverdant meadows of more temperate climes; then follow the birch and the\r\npine, which probably owe their existence in very high latitudes more to\r\nthe warmth of the soil than to that of the air. But even these enduring\r\nplants become dwarfish shrubs, till a verdant carpet of mosses and\r\nlichens, enamelled with flowers, exhibits the last sign of vegetable\r\nlife during the short but fervid summers at the polar regions. Such is\r\nthe effect of cold and diminished light on the vegetable kingdom, that\r\nthe number of species growing under the equator and in the northern\r\nlatitudes of 45° and 68° are in the proportion of the numbers 12, 4, and\r\n1. Notwithstanding the remarkable difference between a tropical and\r\npolar flora, light and moisture seem to be almost the only requisites\r\nfor vegetation, since neither heat, cold, nor even comparative darkness,\r\nabsolutely destroy the fertility of nature. In salt plains and sandy\r\ndeserts alone hopeless barrenness prevails. Plants grow on the borders\r\nof hot springs: they form the oases wherever moisture exists among the\r\nburning sands of Africa; they are found in caverns almost void of light,\r\nthough generally blanched and feeble. The ocean teems with vegetation.\r\nThe snow itself not only produces a red lichen, discovered by Saussure\r\nin the frozen declivities of the Alps, found in abundance by the author\r\ncrossing the Col de Bonhomme from Savoy to Piedmont, and by the polar\r\nnavigators in the Arctic regions, but it affords shelter to the\r\nproductions of these inhospitable climes against the piercing winds that\r\nsweep over fields of everlasting ice. Those undaunted mariners narrate\r\nthat under this cold defence plants spring up, dissolve the snow a few\r\ninches round, and the part above, being again quickly frozen into a\r\ntransparent sheet of ice, admits the sun’s rays, which warm and cherish\r\nthe plants in this natural hothouse, till the returning summer renders\r\nsuch protection unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe chemical action of light is, however, absolutely requisite for the\r\ngrowth of plants which derive their principal nourishment from the\r\natmosphere. They consume the carbonic acid gas, nitrogen, aqueous\r\nvapour, and ammonia it contains; but it is the chemical agency of light\r\nthat enables them to absorb, decompose, and consolidate these substances\r\ninto wood, leaves, flowers, and fruit. The atmosphere would soon be\r\ndeprived of these elements of vegetable life were they not perpetually\r\nsupplied by the animal creation; while, in return, plants decompose the\r\nmoisture they imbibe, and, having assimilated the carbonic acid gas,\r\nthey exhale oxygen for the maintenance of the animated creation, and\r\nthus preserve a just equilibrium. Hence it is the combined and powerful\r\ninfluences of the whole solar beams that give such brilliancy to the\r\ntropical forests, while, with their decreasing energy in the higher\r\nlatitudes, vegetation becomes less vigorous. On that account it is vain\r\nto expect that the fruit and flowers raised in our hothouses can ever\r\nhave the flavour, perfume, or colouring equal to that which they acquire\r\nfrom the vivid light of their native skies.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater number of the known species of plants are indigenous\r\nin equinoctial America; Europe contains about half the number; Asia,\r\nwith its islands, somewhat less than Europe; Australia, with the islands\r\nin the Pacific, still less; and in Africa there are fewer known\r\nvegetable productions than in any part of the globe of equal extent, for\r\nthat rich and luxuriant region discovered by Dr. Livingstone has yet to\r\nbe explored botanically. Very few social plants, such as grasses and\r\nheaths that cover large tracts of land, are to be found between the\r\ntropics, except on the sea-coasts and elevated plains. Some exceptions\r\nto this, however, are to be met with in the jungles of the Deccan, &c.\r\nIn the equatorial regions, where the heat is always great, the\r\ndistribution of plants depends upon the mean annual temperature; whereas\r\nin temperate zones the distribution is regulated in some degree by the\r\nsummer heat. Some plants require a gentle heat of long continuance,\r\nothers flourish most where the extremes of heat and cold are greater.\r\nThe range of wheat is very great; it may be cultivated as far north as\r\nthe 60th degree of latitude; but in the torrid zone it will seldom form\r\nan ear below an elevation of 4500 feet above the level of the sea from\r\nexuberance of vegetation; nor will it ripen generally above the height\r\nof 12,000 feet; in Tibet it ripens at a still greater elevation. Colonel\r\nSykes states that in the Deccan wheat thrives as low as 1800 feet above\r\nthe sea. The best wines are produced between the 30th and 45th degrees\r\nof north latitude. With regard to the vegetable kingdom, elevation is\r\nequivalent to latitude as far as temperature is concerned. In ascending\r\nthe mountains of the torrid zone, the richness of the tropical\r\nvegetation diminishes with the height; a succession of plants similar\r\nto, though not identical with, those found in latitudes of corresponding\r\nmean temperature takes place; the lofty forests by degrees lose their\r\nsplendour; stunted shrubs succeed; till at last the progress of the\r\nlichen is checked by perpetual snow. On the volcano of Teneriffe there\r\nare five successive zones, each producing distinct families of plants.\r\nThe first is the region of vines, the next that of laurels; these are\r\nfollowed by the region of pines, of Ericas or heaths, of grass; the\r\nwhole covering the declivity of the peak through an extent of 11,200\r\nfeet of perpendicular height.\r\n\r\nNear the equator oaks flourish at the height of 9200 feet above the sea;\r\nand, on the lofty range of the Himalaya, the primula, the convallaria,\r\nand the veronica flower, but not the primrose, the lily of the valley,\r\nor the veronica, which adorn our meadows; for, although the herbarium\r\ncollected by Moorcroft, on his route from Neetee to Daba and Gartope in\r\nChinese Tartary, at elevations as high or even higher than Mont Blanc,\r\nabound in Alpine and European genera, the species are universally\r\ndifferent, with the single exception of the Rhodiola rosea, which is\r\nidentical with the species that blooms in Scotland. It is not in this\r\ninstance alone that similarity of climate obtains without identity of\r\nproductions; throughout the whole globe a certain analogy both of\r\nstructure and appearance is frequently discovered between plants under\r\ncorresponding circumstances which are yet specifically different. It is\r\neven said that a difference of 25° of latitude occasions a total change,\r\nnot only of vegetable productions, but of organised beings. Certain it\r\nis that each separate region both of land and water, from the frozen\r\nshores of the polar circles to the burning regions of the torrid zone,\r\npossesses a flora peculiarly its own. The whole globe has been divided\r\nby physical geographers into various botanical districts, differing\r\nalmost entirely in their specific vegetable productions, the limits of\r\nwhich are most decided when they are separated by a wide expanse of\r\nocean, mountain chains, sandy deserts, salt plains, or internal seas. A\r\nconsiderable number of plants are common to the northern regions of\r\nAsia, Europe, and America, where the continents almost unite; but, in\r\napproaching the south, the floras of these three great divisions of the\r\nglobe differ more and more even in the same parallels of latitude, which\r\nshows that temperature alone is not the cause of the almost complete\r\ndiversity of species that everywhere prevails. The floras of China,\r\nSiberia, Tartary, of the European district including central Europe and\r\nthe coast of the Mediterranean, and the Oriental region comprising the\r\ncountries round the Black and Caspian Seas, all differ in specific\r\ncharacter. Only twenty-four species were found by MM. Humboldt and\r\nBonpland in Equinoctial America identical with those of the Old World;\r\nand Dr. Robert Brown not only found that a peculiar vegetation exists in\r\nAustralia between the 33rd and 35th parallels of south latitude, but\r\nthat at the eastern and western extremities of these parallels not one\r\nspecies is common to both, and that certain genera also are almost\r\nentirely confined to these spots. The number of species common to\r\nAustralia and Europe are only 166 out of 4100, and probably some of\r\nthese have been conveyed thither by the colonists; but the greater part\r\nof that continent is still unexplored. However, this proportion exceeds\r\nwhat has hitherto been observed in southern Africa, and, from what has\r\nbeen already stated, the proportion of European species in Equinoctial\r\nAmerica is still less.\r\n\r\nIslands partake of the vegetation of the nearest continents; but, when\r\nvery remote from land, their floras are altogether peculiar. The\r\nAleutian Islands, extending between Asia and America, partake of the\r\nvegetation of the northern parts of both continents, and may have served\r\nas a chain of communication. In Madeira and Teneriffe, the plants of\r\nPortugal, Spain, the Azores, and of the northern coast of Africa, are\r\nfound; and the Canaries contain a great number of plants belonging to\r\nthe African coast. But each of these islands possesses a flora that\r\nexists nowhere else; and St. Helena, standing alone in the midst of the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, produces only two or three species of plants recognised\r\nas belonging to any other part of the world.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the investigations of M. de Humboldt that between the\r\ntropics the plants, such as grasses and palms, which have only one\r\nseed-lobe, are to the tribe which have two seed-lobes, like most of the\r\nEuropean species, in the proportion of one to four; in the temperate\r\nzones they are as one to six; and in the Arctic regions, where mosses\r\nand lichens, which form the lowest order of the vegetable creation,\r\nabound, the proportion is as one to two. Annuals with one and two\r\nseed-lobes, in the temperate zones, amount to one-sixth of the whole,\r\nomitting the cryptogamia (N. 218); in the torrid zone they scarcely form\r\none-twentieth, and in Lapland one-thirtieth part. In approaching the\r\nequator the ligneous exceed the number of herbaceous plants; in America\r\nthere are 120 different species of forest trees, whereas in the same\r\nlatitudes in Europe only 34 are to be found.\r\n\r\nSimilar laws regulate the distribution of marine plants. Groups of algæ,\r\nor marine plants, affect particular temperatures or zones of latitude\r\nand different depths, though some few genera prevail throughout the\r\nocean. The polar Atlantic basin to the 40th degree of north latitude\r\npresents a well-defined vegetation. The West India seas, including the\r\nGulf of Mexico, the eastern coast of South America, the Indian Ocean and\r\nits gulfs, the shores of New Holland, and the neighbouring islands, have\r\neach their distinct species. The Mediterranean possesses a vegetation\r\npeculiar to itself, extending to the Black Sea; and the species of\r\nmarine plants on the coast of Syria and in the port of Alexandria differ\r\nalmost entirely from those of Suez and the Red Sea. It is observed that\r\nshallow seas have a different set of plants from such as are deeper and\r\ncolder; and, unlike terrestrial vegetation, the algæ are more numerous\r\nin the mean latitudes than either towards the equator or the poles. They\r\nvary also with the depth: completely different kinds affect different\r\ndepths, their seeds being of such specific gravity as to remain and\r\ngerminate where the parent plant grew. The quantity of algæ in that\r\naccumulation known as the sargassa or grassy sea is so great, that the\r\nearly navigators, Columbus and Lerius, compared it to extensively\r\ninundated meadows: it impeded their ships, and alarmed their sailors. It\r\nis in the North Atlantic, a little to the west of the meridian of Fayal,\r\none of the Azores, between the 25th and 36th parallels of latitude. A\r\nsmaller bank lies between the 22nd and 26th degrees of north latitude,\r\nabout 80 leagues west of the meridian of the Bahama Islands. These\r\nmasses chiefly consist of one or two species of sargassa, the most\r\nextensive genus of the order Fucoideæ.\r\n\r\nSome of the seaweeds grow to enormous lengths, and all are highly\r\ncoloured, though many of them must grow in deep water. Light, however,\r\nmay not be the only principle on which the colour of vegetables depends,\r\nsince Baron Humboldt met with green plants growing in complete darkness\r\nin one of the mines at Freyberg.\r\n\r\nIn the dark and tranquil caves of the ocean, on the shores alternately\r\ncovered and deserted by the restless waves, on the lofty mountain and\r\nextended plain, in the chilly regions of the north, and in the genial\r\nwarmth of the south, specific diversity is a general law of the\r\nvegetable kingdom, which cannot be accounted for by diversity of\r\nclimate; and yet the similarity, though not identity, of species is\r\nsuch, under the same isothermal lines, that if the number of species\r\nbelonging to one of the great families of plants be known in any part of\r\nthe globe, the whole number of the flowering or more perfect plants, and\r\nalso the number of species composing the other vegetable families, may\r\nbe estimated with considerable accuracy.\r\n\r\nVarious opinions have been formed on the original or primitive\r\ndistribution of plants over the face of the globe; but, since botanical\r\ngeography has become a science, the phenomena observed have led to the\r\nconclusion that vegetable creation must have taken place in a number of\r\ndistinctly different centres, as the islands and continents rose above\r\nthe ocean, each of which was the original seat of a certain number of\r\npeculiar species which at first grew there and nowhere else. Heaths are\r\nexclusively confined to the Old World; and no indigenous rose-tree has\r\never been seen in the New, the whole southern hemisphere being destitute\r\nof that beautiful and fragrant plant. But this is still more confirmed\r\nby multitudes of particular plants, having an entirely local and\r\ninsulated existence, growing spontaneously in some particular spot, and\r\nin no other place: for example, the cedar of Lebanon, which grows\r\nindigenously on that mountain, and in no other part of the world. On the\r\nother hand, as there can be no doubt that many races of plants have been\r\nextinguished, Sir John Herschel thinks it possible that these solitary\r\ninstances may be the last surviving remnants of the same group\r\nuniversally disseminated, but in course of extinction, or that perhaps\r\ntwo processes may be going on at the same time:—“Some groups may be\r\nspreading from their foci, others retreating to their last holds.”\r\n\r\nThe same laws obtain in the distribution of the animal creation. Even\r\nthe microscopic existences, which seem to be the most widely spread,\r\nhave their specific localities; and the zoophyte (N. 219), occupying the\r\nnext lowest place in animated nature, is widely scattered through the\r\nseas of the torrid zone, each species being confined to the district and\r\ndepth best suited to its wants. Mollusks, or the animals of shells,\r\ndecrease in size and beauty with their distance from the equator; and\r\nnot only each sea and every basin of the ocean, but each depth, is\r\ninhabited by its peculiar tribe of fish. Indeed, MM. Peron and Le Sueur\r\nassert that, among the many thousands of marine animals which they had\r\nexamined, there is not a single animal of the southern regions which is\r\nnot distinguishable by essential characters from the analogous species\r\nin the northern seas.\r\n\r\nReptiles are not exempt from the general law. The saurian (N. 220)\r\ntribes of the four quarters of the globe differ in species; and,\r\nalthough warm countries abound in venomous snakes, they are specifically\r\ndifferent in different localities, and decrease both in numbers and in\r\nthe virulence of their poison with decrease of temperature. The\r\ndispersion of insects necessarily follows that of the vegetables which\r\nsupply their food; and in general it is observed that each kind of plant\r\nis peopled by its peculiar inhabitants. Each species of bird has its\r\npeculiar haunt, notwithstanding the locomotive powers of the winged\r\ntribes. The emu is confined to Australia, the condor to the Andes and\r\ntheir declivities, and the bearded vulture or lemmergeyer to the Alps.\r\nSome birds, like the common sparrow, have a wide range; but those met\r\nwith in every country are few in number. Quadrupeds are distributed in\r\nthe same manner wherever man has not interfered. Such as are indigenous\r\nin one country are not the same with their congeners in another; and,\r\nwith the exception of some kind of bats, no mammiferous animal is\r\nindigenous in the Polynesian Archipelago, nor in any of the islands on\r\nthe borders of the central part of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the infinite variety of organised beings that people the\r\nsurface of the globe, nothing is more remarkable than the distinctions\r\nwhich characterise the different tribes of mankind, from the ebony skin\r\nof the torrid zone to the fair and ruddy complexion of the\r\nScandinavian—a difference which existed in the earliest recorded times,\r\nsince the African is represented in the sacred writings to have been as\r\nblack as he is at the present day, and the most ancient Egyptian\r\npaintings confirm that truth; yet it appears, from a comparison of the\r\nprincipal circumstances relating to the animal economy or physical\r\ncharacter of the various tribes of mankind, that the different races are\r\nidentical in species. Many attempts have been made to trace the various\r\ntribes back to a common origin, by collating the numerous languages\r\nwhich are or have been spoken. Some classes of these have few or no\r\nwords in common, yet exhibit a remarkable analogy in the laws of their\r\ngrammatical construction. The languages spoken by the native American\r\nnations afford examples of these; indeed, the refinement in the\r\ngrammatical construction of the tongues of the American savages leads to\r\nthe belief that they must originally have been spoken by a much more\r\ncivilised class of mankind. Some tongues have little or no resemblance\r\nin structure, though they correspond extensively in their vocabularies,\r\nas the Syrian dialects. In all these cases it may be inferred that the\r\nnations speaking the languages in question descended from the same\r\nstock; but the probability of a common origin is much greater in the\r\nIndo-European nations, whose languages, such as the Sanscrit, Greek,\r\nLatin, German, &c., have an affinity both in structure and\r\ncorrespondence of vocables. In many tongues not the smallest resemblance\r\ncan be traced; length of time, however, may have obliterated original\r\nidentity; but so many ages have passed before the subject became a\r\nstudy, and so many languages have worn out of use, that it may be\r\ndoubted whether any satisfactory result will ever be arrived at with\r\nregard to the original speech of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION XXVII.\r\n\r\nTerrestrial Heat—Radiation—Transmission—Melloni’s experiments—Heat\r\n  in Solar Spectrum—Polarization of Heat—Nature of\r\n  Heat—Absorptions—Dew—Rain—Combustion—Expansion—Compensation\r\n  Pendulum—Transmission through Crystals—Propagation—Dynamic Theory\r\n  of Heat—Mechanical equivalent of Heat—Latent Heat is the Force of\r\n  Expansion—Steam—Work performed by Heat—Conservation of\r\n  Force—Mechanical Power in the Tides—Dynamical Power of\r\n  Light—Analogy between Light, Heat, and Sound.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT heat producing rays exist independently of those of light is a\r\nmatter of constant experience in the abundant emission of them from\r\nboiling water. They dart in divergent straight lines from flame and from\r\neach point in the surfaces of hot bodies, in the same manner as\r\ndiverging rays of light proceed from every point of those that are\r\nluminous. According to the experiments of Sir John Leslie, radiation\r\nproceeds not only from the surface of substances, but also from the\r\nparticles at a minute depth below it. He found that the emission is most\r\nabundant in a direction perpendicular to the radiating surface, and that\r\nit is more rapid from a rough than from a polished surface: radiation,\r\nhowever, can only take place in air and in vacuo; it is altogether\r\nimperceptible when the hot body is enclosed in a solid or liquid. Heated\r\nsubstances, when exposed to the open air, continue to radiate heat till\r\nthey become nearly of the temperature of the surrounding medium. The\r\nradiation is very rapid at first, but diminishes according to a known\r\nlaw with the temperature of the heated body. It appears, also, that the\r\nradiating power of a surface is inversely as its reflecting power; and\r\nbodies that are most impermeable to heat radiate least. Substances,\r\nhowever, have an elective power, only reflecting heat of a certain\r\nrefrangibility. Mr. Grove gives paper, snow, and lime as instances,\r\nwhich, although all white, radiate heat of different refrangibilities,\r\nwhile metals, whatever their colour may be, radiate all kinds alike.\r\n\r\nRays of heat, whether they proceed from the sun, from flame, or other\r\nterrestrial sources, luminous or non-luminous, are instantaneously\r\ntransmitted through solid and liquid substances, there being no\r\nappreciable difference in the time they take to pass through layers of\r\nany nature or thickness whatever. They pass also with the same facility\r\nwhether the media be agitated or at rest; and in these respects the\r\nanalogy between light and heat is perfect. Radiant heat passes through\r\nthe gases with the same facility as light; but a remarkable difference\r\nobtains in the transmission of light and heat through most solid and\r\nliquid substances, the same body being often perfectly permeable to the\r\nluminous, and altogether impermeable to the calorific rays. For example,\r\nthin and perfectly transparent plates of alum and citric acid sensibly\r\ntransmit all the rays of light from an argand lamp, but stop eight or\r\nnine tenths of the concomitant heat; whilst a large piece of brown\r\nrock-crystal gives a free passage to the radiant heat, but intercepts\r\nalmost all the light. Alum united to green glass is also capable of\r\ntransmitting the brightest light, but it gives not the slightest\r\nindication of heat; while rock-salt covered thickly over with soot, so\r\nas to be perfectly opaque to light, transmits a considerable quantity of\r\nheat. M. Melloni has established the general law in uncrystallized\r\nsubstances such as glass and liquids, that the property of\r\ninstantaneously transmitting heat is in proportion to their refractive\r\npowers. The law, however, is entirely at fault in bodies of a\r\ncrystalline texture. Carbonate of lead, for instance, which is\r\ncolourless, and possesses a very high refractive power with regard to\r\nlight, transmits less radiant heat than Iceland spar or rock-crystal,\r\nwhich are very inferior to it in the order of refrangibility; whilst\r\nrock-salt, which has the same transparency and refractive power with\r\nalum and citric acid, transmits six or eight times as much heat. This\r\nremarkable difference in the transmissive power of substances having the\r\nsame appearance is attributed by M. Melloni to their crystalline form,\r\nand not to the chemical composition of their molecules, as the following\r\nexperiments prove. A block of common salt cut into plates entirely\r\nexcludes calorific radiation; yet, when dissolved in water, it increases\r\nthe transmissive power of that liquid: moreover, the transmissive power\r\nof water is increased in nearly the same degree, whether salt or alum be\r\ndissolved in it; yet these two substances transmit very different\r\nquantities of heat in their solid state. Notwithstanding the influence\r\nof crystallization on the transmissive power of bodies, no relation has\r\nbeen traced between that power and the crystalline form.\r\n\r\nThe transmission of radiant heat is analogous to that of light through\r\ncoloured media. When common white light passes through a red liquid,\r\nalmost all the more refrangible rays, and a few of the red, are\r\nintercepted by the first layer of the fluid; fewer are intercepted by\r\nthe second, still less by the third, and so on: till at last the losses\r\nbecome very small and invariable, and those rays alone are transmitted\r\nwhich give the red colour to the liquid. In a similar manner, when\r\nplates of the same thickness of any substance, such as glass, are\r\nexposed to an argand lamp, a considerable portion of the radiant heat is\r\narrested by the first plate, a less portion by the second, still less by\r\nthe third, and so on, the quantity of lost heat decreasing till at last\r\nthe loss becomes a constant quantity. The transmission of radiant heat\r\nthrough a solid mass follows the same law. The losses are very\r\nconsiderable on first entering it, but they rapidly diminish in\r\nproportion as the heat penetrates deeper, and become constant at a\r\ncertain depth. Indeed, the only difference between the transmission of\r\nradiant heat through a solid mass, or through the same mass when cut\r\ninto plates of equal thickness, arises from the small quantity of heat\r\nthat is reflected at the surface of the plates. It is evident,\r\ntherefore, that the heat gradually lost is not intercepted at the\r\nsurface, but absorbed in the interior of the substance, and that heat\r\nwhich has passed through one stratum of air experiences a less\r\nabsorption in each of the succeeding strata, and may therefore be\r\npropagated to a greater distance before it is extinguished. The\r\nexperiments of M. de Laroche show that glass, however thin, totally\r\nintercepts the obscure rays of heat when they flow from a body whose\r\ntemperature is lower than that of boiling water; that, as the\r\ntemperature increases, the calorific rays are transmitted more and more\r\nabundantly; and, when the body becomes highly luminous, that they\r\npenetrate the glass with perfect ease. The extreme brilliancy of the sun\r\nis probably the reason why his heat, when brought to a focus by a lens,\r\nis more intense than any that has been produced artificially. It is\r\nowing to the same cause that glass screens, which entirely exclude the\r\nheat of a common fire, are permeable by the solar heat.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by M. de Laroche have been confirmed by the\r\nexperiments of M. Melloni on heat radiated from sources of different\r\ntemperatures, whence it appears that the calorific rays pass less\r\nabundantly not only through glass, but through rock-crystal, Iceland\r\nspar, and other diaphanous bodies, both solid and liquid, according as\r\nthe temperature of their origin is diminished, and that they are\r\naltogether intercepted when the temperature is about that of boiling\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn fact, he has proved that the heat emanating from the sun or from a\r\nbright flame consists of rays which differ from each other as much as\r\nthe coloured rays do which constitute white light. This explains the\r\nreason of the loss of heat as it penetrates deeper and deeper into a\r\nsolid mass, or in passing through a series of plates; for, of the\r\ndifferent kinds of rays which dart from a vivid flame, all are\r\nsuccessively extinguished by the absorbing nature of the substance\r\nthrough which they pass, till those homogeneous rays alone remain which\r\nhave the greatest facility in passing through that particular substance;\r\nexactly as in a red liquid the violet, blue, green, orange, and yellow\r\nrays are extinguished, and the red are transmitted.\r\n\r\nM. Melloni employed four sources of heat, two of which were luminous and\r\ntwo obscure; namely, an oil-lamp without a glass, incandescent platina,\r\ncopper heated to 696°, and a copper vessel filled with water at the\r\ntemperature of 178-1/2° of Fahrenheit. Rock-salt transmitted heat in the\r\nproportion of 92 rays out of 100 from each of these sources; but all\r\nother substances pervious to radiant heat, whether solid or liquid,\r\ntransmitted more heat from sources of high temperature than from such as\r\nare low. For instance, limpid and colourless fluate of lime transmitted\r\nin the proportion of 78 rays out of 100 from the lamp, 69 from the\r\nplatina, 42 from the copper, and 33 from the hot water; while\r\ntransparent rock-crystal transmitted 38 rays in 100 from the lamp, 28\r\nfrom the platina, 6 from the copper, and 9 from the hot water. Pure ice\r\ntransmitted only in the proportion of 6 rays in the 100 from the lamp,\r\nand entirely excluded those from the other three sources. Out of 39\r\ndifferent substances, 34 were pervious to the calorific rays from hot\r\nwater, 14 excluded those from the hot copper, and 4 did not transmit\r\nthose from the platinum.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that heat proceeding from these four sources is of\r\ndifferent kinds: this difference in the nature of the calorific rays is\r\nalso proved by another experiment, which will be more easily understood\r\nfrom the analogy of light. Red light, emanating from red glass, will\r\npass in abundance through another piece of red glass, but it will be\r\nabsorbed by green glass; green rays will more readily pass through a\r\ngreen medium than through one of any other colour. This holds with\r\nregard to all colours; so in heat. Rays of heat of the same intensity,\r\nwhich have passed through different substances, are transmitted in\r\ndifferent quantities by the same piece of alum, and are sometimes\r\nstopped altogether; showing that rays which emanate from different\r\nsubstances possess different qualities. It appears that a bright flame\r\nfurnishes rays of heat of all kinds, in the same manner as it gives\r\nlight of all colours; and, as coloured media transmit some coloured rays\r\nand absorb the rest, so bodies transmit some rays of heat and exclude\r\nthe others. Rock-salt alone resembles colourless transparent media in\r\ntransmitting all kinds of heat, even that of the hand, just as they\r\ntransmit white light, consisting of rays of all colours. Radiant heat is\r\nunequally refracted by a prism of rock-salt like light, and the rays of\r\nheat thus dispersed are found to possess properties analogous to the\r\nrays of the coloured spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe property of transmitting the calorific rays diminishes to a certain\r\ndegree with the thickness of the body they have to traverse, but not so\r\nmuch as might be expected. A piece of very transparent alum transmitted\r\nthree or four times less radiant heat from the flame of a lamp than a\r\npiece of nearly opaque quartz about a hundred times as thick. However,\r\nthe influence of thickness upon the phenomena of transmission increases\r\nwith the decrease of temperature in the origin of the rays, and becomes\r\nvery great when that temperature is low. This is a circumstance\r\nintimately connected with the law established by M. de Laroche; for M.\r\nMelloni observed that the difference between the quantities of heat\r\ntransmitted by the same plate of glass, exposed successively to several\r\nsources of heat, diminished with the thinness of the plate, and vanished\r\naltogether at a certain limit; and that a film of mica transmitted the\r\nsame quantity of heat, whether it was exposed to incandescent platinum\r\nor to a mass of iron heated to 360°.\r\n\r\nColoured glasses transmit rays of light of certain degrees of\r\nrefrangibility, and absorb those of other degrees. For example, red\r\nglass absorbs the more refrangible rays, and transmits the red, which\r\nare the least refrangible. On the contrary, violet glass absorbs the\r\nleast refrangible, and transmits the violet, which are the most\r\nrefrangible. Now M. Melloni has found, that, although the colouring\r\nmatter of glass diminishes its power of transmitting heat, yet red,\r\norange, yellow, blue, violet, and white glass transmit calorific rays of\r\nall degrees of refrangibility; whereas green glass possesses the\r\npeculiar property of transmitting the least refrangible calorific rays,\r\nand stopping those that are most refrangible. It has therefore the same\r\nelective action for heat that coloured glass has for light, and its\r\naction on heat is analogous to that of red glass on light. Alum and\r\nsulphate of lime are exactly opposed to green glass in their action on\r\nheat, by transmitting the most refrangible rays with the greatest\r\nfacility.\r\n\r\nThe heat which has already passed through green or opaque black glass\r\nwill not pass through alum, whilst that which has been transmitted\r\nthrough glasses of other colours traverses it readily.\r\n\r\nBy reversing the experiment, and exposing different substances to heat\r\nthat had already passed through alum, M. Melloni found that the heat\r\nemerging from alum is almost totally intercepted by opaque substances,\r\nand is abundantly transmitted by all such as are transparent and\r\ncolourless, and that it suffers no appreciable loss when the thickness\r\nof the plate is varied within certain limits. The properties of the heat\r\ntherefore which issues from alum nearly approach to those of light and\r\nsolar heat.\r\n\r\nRadiant heat in traversing various media is not only rendered more or\r\nless capable of being transmitted a second time, but, according to the\r\nexperiments of Professor Powell, it becomes more or less susceptible of\r\nbeing absorbed in different quantities by black or white surfaces.\r\n\r\nM. Melloni has proved that solar heat contains rays which are affected\r\nby different substances in the same way as if the heat proceeded from a\r\nterrestrial source; whence he concludes that the difference observed\r\nbetween the transmission of terrestrial and solar heat arises from the\r\ncircumstance of solar heat containing all kinds of heat, whilst in other\r\nsources some of the kinds are wanting.\r\n\r\nRadiant heat, from sources of any temperature whatever, is subject to\r\nthe same laws of reflection and refraction as rays of light. The index\r\nof refraction from a prism of rock-salt, determined experimentally, is\r\nnearly the same for light and heat.\r\n\r\nLiquids, the various kinds of glass, and probably all substances,\r\nwhether solid or liquid, that do not crystallize regularly, are more\r\npervious to the calorific rays according as they possess a greater\r\nrefractive power. For example, the chloride of sulphur, which has a high\r\nrefractive power, transmits more of the calorific rays than the oils,\r\nwhich have a less refractive power: oils transmit more radiant heat than\r\nthe acids; the acids more than aqueous solutions; and the latter more\r\nthan pure water, which of all the series has the least refractive power,\r\nand is the least pervious to heat. M. Melloni observed also that each\r\nray of the solar spectrum follows the same law of action with that of\r\nterrestrial rays having their origin in sources of different\r\ntemperatures; so that the very refrangible rays may be compared to the\r\nheat emanating from a focus of high temperature, and the least\r\nrefrangible to the heat which comes from a source of low temperature.\r\nThus, if the calorific rays emerging from a prism be made to pass\r\nthrough a layer of water contained between two plates of glass, it will\r\nbe found that these rays suffer a loss in passing through the liquid as\r\nmuch greater as their refrangibility is less. The rays of heat that are\r\nmixed with the blue or violet light pass in great abundance, while those\r\nin the obscure part which follows the red light are almost totally\r\nintercepted. The first, therefore, act like the heat of a lamp, and the\r\nlast like that of boiling water.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances explain the phenomena observed by several\r\nphilosophers with regard to the point of greatest heat in the solar\r\nspectrum, which varies with the substance of the prism. Sir William\r\nHerschel, who employed a prism of flint glass, found that point to be a\r\nlittle beyond the red extremity of the spectrum; but, according to M.\r\nSeebeck, it is found to be upon the yellow, upon the orange, on the red,\r\nor at the dark limit of the red, according as the prism consists of\r\nwater, sulphuric acid, crown or flint glass. If it be recollected that,\r\nin the spectrum from crown glass, the maximum heat is in the red part,\r\nand that the solar rays, in traversing a mass of water, suffer losses\r\ninversely as their refrangibility, it will be easy to understand the\r\nreason of the phenomenon in question. The solar heat which comes to the\r\nanterior face of the prism of water consists of rays of all degrees of\r\nrefrangibility. Now, the rays possessing the same index of refraction\r\nwith the red light suffer a greater loss in passing through the prism\r\nthan the rays possessing the refrangibility of the orange light, and the\r\nlatter lose less in their passage than the heat of the yellow. Thus the\r\nlosses, being inversely proportional to the degree of refrangibility of\r\neach ray, cause the point of maximum heat to tend from the red towards\r\nthe violet, and therefore it rests upon the yellow part. The prism of\r\nsulphuric acid, acting similarly, but with less energy than that of\r\nwater, throws the point of greatest heat on the orange; for the same\r\nreason, the crown and flint glass prisms transfer that point\r\nrespectively to the red and to its limit. M. Melloni, observing that the\r\nmaximum point of heat is transferred farther and farther towards the red\r\nend of the spectrum, according as the substance of the prism is more and\r\nmore permeable to heat, inferred that a prism of rock-salt, which\r\npossesses a greater power of transmitting the calorific rays than any\r\nknown body, ought to throw the point of greatest heat to a considerable\r\ndistance beyond the visible part of the spectrum,—an anticipation which\r\nexperiment fully confirmed, by placing it as much beyond the dark limits\r\nof the red rays as the red part is distant from the blueish green band\r\nof the spectrum.\r\n\r\nIn all these experiments M. Melloni employed a thermomultiplier,—an\r\ninstrument that measures the intensity of the transmitted heat with an\r\naccuracy far beyond what any thermometer ever attained. It is a very\r\nelegant application of M. Seebeck’s discovery of thermo-electricity; but\r\nthe description of this instrument is reserved for a future occasion,\r\nbecause the principle on which it is constructed has not yet been\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the present century, not long after M. Malus had\r\ndiscovered the polarization of light, he and M. Berard proved that the\r\nheat which accompanies the sun’s light is capable of being polarized;\r\nbut their attempts totally failed with heat derived from terrestrial,\r\nand especially from non-luminous sources. M. Berard, indeed, imagined\r\nthat he had succeeded; but, when his experiments were repeated by Mr.\r\nLloyd and Professor Powell, no satisfactory result could be obtained. M.\r\nMelloni resumed the subject, and endeavoured to effect the polarization\r\nof heat by tourmaline, as in the case of light. It was already shown\r\nthat two slices of tourmaline, cut parallel to the axis of the crystal,\r\ntransmit a great portion of the incident light when looked through with\r\ntheir axes parallel, and almost entirely exclude it when they are\r\nperpendicular to one another. Should radiant heat be capable of\r\npolarization, the quantity transmitted by the slices of tourmaline in\r\ntheir former position ought greatly to exceed that which passes through\r\nthem in the latter, yet M. Melloni found that the quantity of heat was\r\nthe same in both cases: whence he inferred that heat from a terrestrial\r\nsource is incapable of being polarized. Professor Forbes of Edinburgh,\r\nwho prosecuted this subject with great acuteness and success, came to\r\nthe same conclusion in the first instance; but it occurred to him, that,\r\nas the pieces of tourmaline became heated by being very near the lamp,\r\nthe secondary radiation from them rendered the very small difference in\r\nthe heat that was transmitted in the two positions of the pieces of\r\ntourmaline imperceptible. Nevertheless he succeeded in proving, by\r\nnumerous observations, that heat from various sources is polarized by\r\nthe tourmaline; but that the effect with non-luminous heat is very\r\nminute and difficult to perceive, on account of the secondary radiation.\r\nThough light is almost entirely excluded in one position of the pieces\r\nof tourmaline, and transmitted in the other, a vast quantity of radiant\r\nheat passes through them in all positions. Eighty-four per cent. of the\r\nheat from an argand lamp passed through them in the case where light was\r\naltogether stopped. It is only the difference in the quantity of\r\ntransmitted heat that gives evidence of its polarization. The second\r\nslice of tourmaline, when perpendicular to the first, stops all the\r\nlight, but transmits a great proportion of heat; alum, on the contrary,\r\nstops almost all the heat, and transmits the light; whence it may be\r\nconcluded that heat, though intimately partaking the nature of light,\r\nand accompanying it under certain circumstances, as in reflection and\r\nrefraction, is capable of almost complete separation from it under\r\nothers. The separation has since been perfectly effected by M. Melloni,\r\nby passing a beam of light through a combination of water and green\r\nglass, coloured by the oxide of copper. Even when the transmitted light\r\nwas concentrated by lenses, so as to render it almost as brilliant as\r\nthe direct light of the sun, it showed no sensible heat.\r\n\r\nProfessor Forbes next employed two bundles of laminæ of mica, placed at\r\nthe polarizing angle, and so cut that the plane of incidence of the heat\r\ncorresponded with one of the optic axes of this mineral. The heat\r\ntransmitted through this apparatus was polarized from a source whose\r\ntemperature was even as low as 200°; heat was also polarized by\r\nreflection; but the experiments, though perfectly successful, are more\r\ndifficult to conduct.\r\n\r\nIt appears, from the various experiments of M. Melloni and Professor\r\nForbes, that all the calorific rays emanating from the sun and\r\nterrestrial sources are equally capable of being polarized by reflection\r\nand by refraction, whether double or single, and that they are also\r\ncapable of circular polarization by all the methods employed in the\r\ncircular polarization of light. Plates of quartz cut at right angles to\r\nthe axis of the prism possess the property of turning the calorific rays\r\nin one direction, while other plates of the same substance from a\r\ndifferently modified prism cause the rays to rotate in the contrary\r\ndirection; and two plates combined, when of different affection, and of\r\nequal thickness, counteract each other’s effects as in the case of\r\nlight. Tourmaline separates the heat into two parts, one of which it\r\nabsorbs, while it transmits the other; in short, the transmission of\r\nradiant heat is precisely similar to that of light.\r\n\r\nSince heat is polarized in the same manner as light, it may be expected\r\nthat polarized heat transmitted through doubly refracting substances\r\nshould be separated into two pencils, polarized in planes at right\r\nangles to each other; and that when received on an analyzing plate they\r\nshould interfere and produce invisible phenomena, perfectly analogous to\r\nthose described in Section XXII. with regard to light (N. 221).\r\n\r\nIt was shown, in the same section, that if light polarized by reflection\r\nfrom a pane of glass be viewed through a plate of tourmaline, with its\r\nlongitudinal section vertical, an obscure cloud, with its centre wholly\r\ndark, is seen on the glass. When, however, a plate of mica uniformly\r\nabout the thirteenth of an inch in thickness is interposed between the\r\ntourmaline and the glass, the dark spot vanishes, and a succession of\r\nvery splendid colours are seen; and, as the mica is turned round in a\r\nplane perpendicular to the polarized ray, the light is stopped when the\r\nplane containing the optic axis of the mica is parallel or perpendicular\r\nto the plane of polarization. Now, instead of light, if heat from a\r\nnon-luminous source be polarized in the manner described, it ought to be\r\ntransmitted and stopped by the interposed mica under the same\r\ncircumstances under which polarized light would be transmitted or\r\nstopped. Professor Forbes found that this is really the case, whether he\r\nemployed heat from luminous or non-luminous sources: and he had\r\nevidence, also, of circular and elliptical polarization of heat. It\r\ntherefore follows, that if heat were visible, under similar\r\ncircumstances we should see figures perfectly similar to those given in\r\nNote 213, and those following; and, as these figures are formed by the\r\ninterference of undulations of light, it may be inferred that heat, like\r\nlight, is propagated by undulations of the ethereal medium, which\r\ninterfere under certain conditions, and produce figures analogous to\r\nthose of light. It appears also, from Mr. Forbes’s experiments, that the\r\nundulations of heat are longer than the undulations of light; and it has\r\nalready been mentioned that Professor Draper considers them to be\r\nnormal, like those of sound.\r\n\r\nThat light and heat are both vibrations of the ethereal medium is not\r\nthe less true on account of the rays of heat being unseen, for the\r\ncondition of visibility or invisibility may only depend upon the\r\nconstruction of our eyes, and not upon the nature of the motion which\r\nproduces these sensations in us. The sense of seeing may be confined\r\nwithin certain limits. The chemical rays beyond the violet end of the\r\nspectrum may be too rapid, or not sufficiently excursive, in their\r\nvibrations, to be visible to the human eye; and the calorific rays\r\nbeyond the other end of the spectrum may not be sufficiently rapid, or\r\ntoo extensive, in their undulations, to affect our optic nerves, though\r\nboth may be visible to certain animals or insects. We are altogether\r\nignorant of the perceptions which direct the carrier-pigeon to his home,\r\nor of those in the antennæ of insects which warn them of the approach of\r\ndanger; nor can we understand the telescopic vision which directs the\r\nvulture to his prey before he himself is visible even as a speck in the\r\nheavens. So, likewise, beings may exist on earth, in the air, or in the\r\nwaters, which hear sounds our ears are incapable of hearing, and which\r\nsee rays of light and heat of which we are unconscious. Our perceptions\r\nand faculties are limited to a very small portion of that immense chain\r\nof existence which extends from the Creator to evanescence.\r\n\r\nThe identity of action under similar circumstances is one of the\r\nstrongest arguments in favour of the common nature of the chemical,\r\nvisible, and calorific rays. They are all capable of reflection from\r\npolished surfaces, of refraction through diaphanous substances, of\r\npolarization by reflection and by doubly refracting crystals; their\r\nvelocity is prodigious; they may be concentrated and dispersed by convex\r\nand concave mirrors; they pass with equal facility through rock-salt and\r\nare capable of radiation; and they are subject to the same law of\r\ninterference with those of light: hence there can be no doubt that the\r\nwhole assemblage of rays visible and invisible which constitute a solar\r\nbeam are propagated by the undulations of the ethereal medium, and\r\nconsequently as motions they come under the same laws of analysis.\r\n\r\nWhen radiant heat falls upon a surface, part of it is reflected and part\r\nof it is absorbed; consequently, the best reflectors possess the least\r\nabsorbing powers. The temperature of very transparent fluids is not\r\nraised by the passage of the sun’s rays, because they do not absorb any\r\nof them; and, as his heat is very intense, transparent solids arrest a\r\nvery small portion of it. The absorption of the sun’s rays is the cause\r\nboth of the colour and temperature of solid bodies. A black substance\r\nabsorbs all the rays of light, and reflects none; and since it absorbs,\r\nat the same time, all the calorific rays, it becomes sooner warm, and\r\nrises to a higher temperature, than bodies of any other colour. Blue\r\nbodies come next to black in their power of absorption. And, since\r\nsubstances of a blue tint absorb all the other colours of the spectrum,\r\nthey absorb by far the greatest part of the calorific rays, and reflect\r\nthe blue where they are least abundant. Next in order come the green,\r\nyellow, red, and, last of all, white bodies, which reflect nearly all\r\nthe rays both of light and heat. However, there are certain limpid and\r\ncolourless media, which in some cases intercept calorific radiations and\r\nbecome heated, while in other cases they transmit them and undergo no\r\nchange of temperature.\r\n\r\nAll substances may be considered to radiate heat, whatever their\r\ntemperature may be, though with different intensities, according to\r\ntheir nature, the state of their surfaces, and the temperature of the\r\nmedium into which they are brought. But every surface absorbs as well as\r\nradiates heat; and the power of absorption is always equal to that of\r\nradiation; for, under the same circumstances, matter which becomes soon\r\nwarm also cools rapidly. There is a constant tendency to an equal\r\ndiffusion of heat, since every body in nature is giving and receiving it\r\nat the same instant; each will be of uniform temperature when the\r\nquantities of heat given and received during the same time are\r\nequal—that is, when a perfect compensation takes place between each and\r\nall the rest. Our sensations only measure comparative degrees of heat:\r\nwhen a body, such as ice, appears to be cold, it imparts fewer calorific\r\nrays than it receives; and when a substance seems to be warm—for\r\nexample, a fire—it gives more heat than it takes. The phenomena of dew\r\nand hoar-frost are owing to this inequality of exchange; the heat\r\nradiated during the night by substances on the surface of the earth,\r\ninto a clear expanse of sky, is lost to us, and no return is made from\r\nthe blue vault, so that their temperature sinks below that of the air,\r\nwhence they abstract a part of that heat which holds the atmospheric\r\nhumidity in solution, and a deposition of dew takes place. If the\r\nradiation be great, the dew is frozen and becomes hoar-frost, which is\r\nthe ice of dew. Cloudy weather is unfavourable to the formation of dew,\r\nby preventing the free radiation of heat; and actual contact is\r\nrequisite for its deposition, since it is never suspended in the air\r\nlike fog. Plants derive a great part of their nourishment from this\r\nsource; and, as each possesses a power of radiation peculiar to itself,\r\nthey are capable of procuring a sufficient supply for their wants. The\r\naction of the chemical rays imparts to all substances more or less the\r\npower of condensing vapour on those parts on which they fall, and must\r\ntherefore have a considerable influence on the deposition of dew. There\r\nmay be a low degree of humidity in the air which may yet contain a great\r\nquantity of aqueous vapour, for vapour while it exists as gas is dry.\r\nThe temperature at which the atmosphere can contain no more vapour\r\nwithout precipitation is called the dew point, and is measured by the\r\nhygrometer. In foretelling the changes of weather it is scarcely\r\ninferior to the barometer.\r\n\r\nSteam is formed throughout the whole mass of a boiling liquid, whereas\r\nevaporation takes place only at the free surface of liquids, and that\r\nunder the ordinary temperature and pressure of the atmosphere. There is\r\na constant evaporation from the land and water all over the earth. The\r\nrapidity of the formation does not depend altogether on the dryness of\r\nthe air; according to Dr. Dalton’s experiments, it depends also on the\r\ndifference between the tension of the vapour which is forming, and that\r\nwhich is already in the atmosphere. In calm weather vapour accumulates\r\nin the stratum of air immediately above the evaporating surface, and\r\nretards the formation of more; whereas a strong wind accelerates the\r\nprocess by carrying off the vapour as soon as it rises, and making way\r\nfor a succeeding portion of dry air.\r\n\r\nRain is formed by the mixing of two masses of air of different\r\ntemperatures; the colder part, by abstracting from the other the heat\r\nwhich holds it in solution, occasions the particles to approach each\r\nother and form drops of water, which, becoming too heavy to be sustained\r\nby the atmosphere, sink to the earth by gravitation in the form of rain.\r\nThe contact of two strata of air of different temperatures, moving\r\nrapidly in opposite directions, occasions an abundant precipitation of\r\nrain. When the masses of air differ very much in temperature, and meet\r\nsuddenly, hail is formed. This happens frequently in hot plains near a\r\nridge of mountains, as in the south of France, from the sudden descent\r\nof an intensely cold current of wind into a mass of air nearly saturated\r\nwith vapour. Such also is the cause of the severe hail-storms which\r\noccasionally take place on extensive plains within the tropics.\r\n\r\nAn accumulation of heat invariably produces light: with the exception of\r\nthe gases, all bodies which can endure the requisite degree of heat\r\nwithout decomposition begin to emit light at the same temperature; but,\r\nwhen the quantity of heat is so great as to render the affinity of their\r\ncomponent particles less than their affinity for the oxygen of the\r\natmosphere, a chemical combination takes place with the oxygen, light\r\nand heat are evolved, and fire is produced. Combustion—so essential for\r\nour comfort, and even existence—takes place very easily from the small\r\naffinity between the component parts of atmospheric air, the oxygen\r\nbeing nearly in a free state; but, as the cohesive force of the\r\nparticles of different substances is very variable, different degrees of\r\nheat are requisite to produce their combustion. The tendency of heat to\r\na state of equal diffusion or equilibrium, either by radiation or\r\ncontact, makes it necessary that the chemical combination which\r\noccasions combustion should take place instantaneously; for, if the heat\r\nwere developed progressively, it would be dissipated by degrees, and\r\nwould never accumulate sufficiently to produce a temperature high enough\r\nfor the evolution of flame.\r\n\r\nIt is a general law that all bodies expand by heat and contract by cold.\r\nThe expansive force of heat has a constant tendency to overcome the\r\nattraction of cohesion, and to separate the constituent particles of\r\nsolids and fluids; by this separation the attraction of aggregation is\r\nmore and more weakened, till at last it is entirely overcome, or even\r\nchanged into repulsion. By the continual addition of heat, solids may be\r\nmade to pass into liquids, and from liquids to the aëriform state, the\r\ndilatation increasing with the temperature; and every substance expands\r\naccording to a law of its own. Gases expand more than liquids, and\r\nliquids more than solids. The expansion of air is more than eight times\r\nthat of water, and the increase in the bulk of water is at least\r\nforty-five times greater than that of iron. Metals dilate uniformly from\r\nthe freezing to the boiling points of the thermometer; the uniform\r\nexpansion of the gases extends between still wider limits; but, as\r\nliquidity is a state of transition from the solid to the aëriform\r\ncondition, the equable dilatation of liquids has not so extensive a\r\nrange. This change of bulk, corresponding to the variation of heat, is\r\none of the most important of its effects, since it furnishes the means\r\nof measuring relative temperature by the thermometer and pyrometer. The\r\nrate of expansion of solids varies at their transition to liquidity, and\r\nthat of liquidity is no longer equable near their change to an aëriform\r\nstate. There are exceptions, however, to the general laws of expansion;\r\nsome liquids have a maximum density corresponding to a certain\r\ntemperature, and dilate whether that temperature be increased or\r\ndiminished. For example—water expands whether it be heated above or\r\ncooled below 40°. The solidification of some liquids, and especially\r\ntheir crystallization, is always accompanied by an increase of bulk.\r\nWater dilates rapidly when converted into ice, and with a force\r\nsufficient to split the hardest substances. The formation of ice is\r\ntherefore a powerful agent in the disintegration and decomposition of\r\nrocks, operating as one of the most efficient causes of local changes in\r\nthe structure of the crust of the earth; of which we have experience in\r\nthe tremendous _éboulemens_ of mountains in Switzerland. But Professor\r\nW. Thomson has proved experimentally that it requires a lower\r\ntemperature to freeze water under pressure than when free.\r\n\r\nThe dilatation of substances by heat, and their contraction by cold,\r\noccasion such irregularities in the rate of clocks and watches as would\r\nrender them unfit for astronomical or nautical purposes, were it not for\r\na very beautiful application of the laws of unequal expansion. The\r\noscillations of a pendulum are the same as if its whole mass were united\r\nin one dense particle, in a certain point of its length, called the\r\ncentre of oscillation. If the distance of this point from the point by\r\nwhich the pendulum is suspended were invariable, the rate of the clock\r\nwould be invariable also. The difficulty is to neutralize the effects of\r\ntemperature, which is perpetually increasing or diminishing its length.\r\nAmong many contrivances, Graham’s compensation pendulum is the most\r\nsimple. He employed a glass tube containing mercury. When the tube\r\nexpands from the effects of heat, the mercury expands much more; so that\r\nits surface rises a little more than the end of the pendulum is\r\ndepressed, and the centre of oscillation remains stationary. Harrison\r\ninvented a pendulum which consists of seven bars of steel and of brass,\r\njoined in the shape of a gridiron, in such a manner that, if by change\r\nof temperature the bars of brass raise the weight at the end of the\r\npendulum, the bars of steel depress it as much. In general, only five\r\nbars are used; three being of steel, and two a mixture of silver and\r\nzinc. The effects of temperature are neutralized in chronometers upon\r\nthe same principle; and to such perfection are they brought, that the\r\nloss or gain of one second in twenty-four hours for two days running\r\nwould render one unfit for use. Accuracy in surveying depends upon the\r\ncompensation rods employed in measuring bases. Thus, the laws of the\r\nunequal expansion of matter judiciously applied have an immediate\r\ninfluence upon our estimation of time; of the motions of bodies in the\r\nheavens, and of their fall upon the earth; on our determination of the\r\nfigure of the globe, and on our system of weights and measures; on our\r\ncommerce abroad, and the mensuration of our lands at home.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the crystalline substances takes place under very\r\ndifferent circumstances from the dilatation of such as are not\r\ncrystallized. The latter become both longer and thicker by an accession\r\nof heat, whereas M. Mitscherlich has found that the former expand\r\ndifferently in different directions; and, in a particular instance,\r\nextension in one direction is accompanied by contraction in another: for\r\nexample, Iceland spar is dilated in the direction of its axis of double\r\nrefraction (N. 205), but at right angles to that axis it is contracted,\r\nwhich brings the crystal nearer to the form of the cube and diminishes\r\nits double refractive power. When heat is applied to crystals of\r\nsulphate of lime, the two optical axes (N. 207) gradually approach, and\r\nat last coincide; when the heat is increased, the axes open again, but\r\nin a direction at right angles to their former position. By experiment\r\nM. Senarmont has concluded, that in media constituted like crystals of\r\nthe rhomboidal (N. 169) system the conducting power varies in such a\r\nmanner, that, supposing a centre of heat to exist within them, and the\r\nmedium to be indefinitely extended in all directions, the isothermal\r\nsurfaces are concentric ellipsoids of revolution round the axes of\r\nsymmetry, or at least surfaces differing but little from them. The\r\ninternal structure of crystallized matter must be very peculiar thus to\r\nmodify the expansive power of heat.\r\n\r\nHeat applied to the surface of a fluid is propagated downwards very\r\nslowly, the warmer, and consequently lighter strata, always remaining at\r\nthe top. This is the reason why the water at the bottom of lakes fed\r\nfrom Alpine chains is so cold; for the heat of the sun is transfused but\r\na little way below the surface. When the heat is applied below a liquid,\r\nthe particles continually rise as they become specifically lighter, and\r\ndiffuse the heat through the mass, their place being perpetually\r\nsupplied by those that are more dense. The power of conducting heat\r\nvaries materially in different liquids. Mercury conducts twice as fast\r\nas an equal bulk of water, and therefore it appears to be very cold. A\r\nhot body diffuses its heat in the air by a double process: the air in\r\ncontact with it becoming lighter ascends and scatters its heat by\r\ntransmission, while at the same time another portion is discharged in\r\nstraight lines by the radiating power of the surface. Hence a substance\r\ncools more rapidly in air than in vacuo, because in the latter case the\r\nprocess is carried on by radiation alone. It is probable that the earth\r\nhaving been originally of very high temperature has become cooler by\r\nradiation alone, the ethereal medium being too rare to carry off much\r\nheat by contact.\r\n\r\nHeat is propagated with more or less rapidity through all bodies; air is\r\nthe worst conductor, and consequently mitigates the severity of cold\r\nclimates by preserving the heat imparted to the earth by the sun. On the\r\ncontrary, dense bodies, especially metals, possess the power of\r\nconduction in the greatest degree, but the transmission requires time.\r\nIf a bar of iron twenty inches long be heated at one extremity, the heat\r\ntakes four minutes in passing to the other. The particle of the metal\r\nthat is first heated communicates the heat to the second, and the second\r\nto the third: so that the temperature of the intermediate molecule at\r\nany instant is increased by the excess of the temperature of the first\r\nabove its own, and diminished by the excess of its own temperature above\r\nthat of the third. That however will not be the temperature indicated by\r\nthe thermometer, because as soon as the particle is more heated than the\r\nsurrounding atmosphere it loses its heat by radiation, in proportion to\r\nthe excess of its actual temperature above that of the air. The velocity\r\nof the discharge is directly proportional to the temperature, and\r\ninversely as the length of the bar. As there are perpetual variations in\r\nthe temperature of all terrestrial substances, and of the atmosphere,\r\nfrom the rotation of the earth, and its revolution round the sun, from\r\ncombustion, friction, fermentation, electricity, and an infinity of\r\nother causes, the tendency to restore the equability of temperature by\r\nthe transmission of heat must maintain all the particles of matter in a\r\nstate of perpetual oscillation, which will be more or less rapid\r\naccording to the conducting powers of the substances. From the motion of\r\nthe heavenly bodies about their axes, and also round the sun, exposing\r\nthem to perpetual changes of temperature, it may be inferred that\r\nsimilar causes will produce like effects in them too. The revolutions of\r\nthe double stars show that they are not at rest; and although we are\r\ntotally ignorant of the changes that may be going on in the nebulæ and\r\nmillions of other remote bodies, it is hardly possible that they should\r\nbe in absolute repose; so that, as far as our knowledge extends, motion\r\nis a law of the universe and the immediate cause of heat, as in the\r\nsunbeam so also in all terrestrial phenomena.\r\n\r\nThis is by no means hypothetical, but founded upon fact and experiment.\r\nHeat is produced by motion and is equivalent to it, for we measure heat\r\nby motion in the thermometer. The heat evolved by percussion is\r\nproportional to the force of the blow; by repeated blows iron becomes\r\nred hot; and the quantity of heat produced by friction, whether the\r\nmatter be solid or fluid, is always in proportion to the force employed:\r\nin cold weather we rub our hands to make them warm, and the harder we\r\nrub the warmer they become. The warmth of the sea after a storm is in\r\nproportion to the force of the wind; and in Sir Humphry Davy’s\r\nexperiment of melting ice by friction in the receiver of an air-pump\r\nkept at the freezing point, the heat which melted the ice was exactly\r\nproportional to the force of friction. This experiment proves the\r\nimmateriality of heat, since the capacity of ice for heat is less than\r\nthat of water. Thus mechanical action and heat are equivalent to one\r\nanother. Mr. Joule of Manchester[13] has proved that the quantity of\r\nheat requisite to raise the temperature of a pound of water one degree\r\nof Fahrenheit’s thermometer, is equivalent to the mechanical force\r\ndeveloped by the fall of a body weighing 772·69 pounds through the\r\nperpendicular height of one foot. This quantity is the mechanical\r\nequivalent of heat. Thus heat is motion, and it is measured by force. In\r\nfact, for every unit of force expended in friction or percussion, a\r\ndefinite quantity of heat is generated; and conversely, when work is\r\nperformed by the consumption of heat, for each unit of force gained, a\r\nunit of heat disappears. For since heat is a dynamical force of\r\nmechanical effect, there must be an equivalent between mechanical work\r\nand heat as between cause and effect. (N. 222.)\r\n\r\nBesides the temperature indicated by the thermometer, bodies absorb\r\nheat, and their capacity for heat is so various that very different\r\nquantities of heat are required to raise different substances to the\r\nsame sensible temperature. It is evident, therefore, that much of the\r\nheat is absorbed and becomes insensible to the thermometer. That portion\r\nof heat requisite to raise a body to a given temperature is its specific\r\nheat, but the latent or absorbed heat is an expansive force or energy,\r\nwhich, acting upon the ether surrounding the ultimate particles of\r\nbodies, changes them from solid to liquid, and from liquid to vapour or\r\ngas. According to the law of absorption, the transfer of heat from a\r\nwarm body to one that is cold is a mere transfer of force, in which the\r\nforce of compression is exactly proportional to the force of expansion.\r\nIce remains at the temperature of 32° Fahrenheit till it has absorbed\r\n140° of heat, and then it melts, but without raising the temperature of\r\nthe water above 32°. On the contrary, when a liquid is converted into a\r\nsolid, a quantity of heat leaves it without any diminution of\r\ntemperature. Thus water at 32° must part with 140° of heat before it\r\nfreezes. The slowness with which water freezes or ice thaws, is a\r\nconsequence of the time required for the ethereal atmospheres round the\r\nparticles of the water to contract or expand with a force equivalent to\r\n140° of heat. A considerable degree of cold is felt during a thaw,\r\nbecause the ice in its transition from a solid to a liquid state absorbs\r\nsensible heat from the atmosphere and surrounding objects. The heat\r\nabsorbed and evolved by the rarefaction and condensation of air is\r\nexactly proportional to the force evolved and absorbed in these\r\noperations. In fact, the changes of temperature produced by these\r\nrarefactions and condensations of air show that the heat of elastic\r\nfluids is the mechanical force possessed by them; and since the\r\ntemperature of a gas determines its elastic force, it follows that the\r\nelastic force or pressure must be the effect of the motion of the\r\nconstituent particles in any gas. Sir Humphry Davy, who first\r\ndemonstrated the immateriality of heat, assumed the hypothesis that the\r\nmotion we call heat is a rotation or vibration among the particles of\r\nthe fluid, which, according to Mr. Joule, agrees perfectly with the\r\nobserved phenomena, but he prefers the more simple view of Mr. Herapath,\r\nthat the elastic force or pressure is due to the impact of the particles\r\nagainst any surface presented to them. Absorbed or latent heat may be\r\nregarded as a quiescent energy ready to be restored to the form of\r\nsensible heat when called forth: its vibrations as heat are extinguished\r\nfor the time by being transferred to the internal expansive force, and\r\nare restored by compression. The absorbed heat of air and all elastic\r\nfluids may be forced out by sudden compression like squeezing water out\r\nof a sponge. The quantity of heat brought into action in this way is\r\nwell illustrated by the experiment of igniting tinder by the sudden\r\ncompression of air by a piston thrust into a cylinder closed at one end.\r\nThe development of heat on a stupendous scale is exhibited in lightning:\r\nit is proportional to the square of the quantity of electricity\r\ndischarged, and is due to its excessive velocity and the violent\r\ncompression of the air in its transit through the atmosphere. Prodigious\r\nquantities of heat are constantly absorbed or disengaged by the changes\r\nto which substances are liable in passing from the solid to the liquid\r\nand from the liquid to the gaseous form and the contrary, causing\r\nendless vicissitudes of temperature over the globe, and endless\r\nexpansions and contractions, which are correlative terms for heat and\r\ncold, while radiation of heat is merely a transfer of motion from the\r\nparticles on the surface of bodies to the adjacent particles of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nBy the continual application of heat, that is of the expansive force,\r\nliquids are converted into steam or vapour, which is invisible and\r\nhighly elastic. Under the mean pressure of the atmosphere, that is when\r\nthe barometer stands at 30 inches, water in a boiler absorbs heat\r\ncontinually till it attains the temperature of the boiling point, which\r\nis 212° Fahrenheit. After that it ceases to show any increase of\r\nsensible heat; but when it has absorbed an additional 1000° of heat or\r\nexpansive energy, that energy converts it into steam, and a condensing\r\nforce equivalent to 1000° of heat reduces it again to water. Water boils\r\nat different temperatures under different degrees of pressure. It boils\r\nat a lower temperature on the top of a mountain than on the plain below,\r\nbecause the weight of the atmosphere is less at the higher station.\r\nThere is no limit to the temperature to which water might be raised: it\r\nmight even be made red hot, could a vessel be found strong enough to\r\nresist the pressure, for the intensity of the expansive force prevented\r\nfrom having effect by the extreme pressure of the boiler would be\r\nconverted into sensible heat which might eventually render the water red\r\nhot. Thus, since the force of steam is in proportion to the temperature\r\nat which the water boils, or to the pressure, it is under control, and,\r\nperhaps with the exception of electricity, it is the greatest power that\r\nhas been made subservient to the wants of man.\r\n\r\nIt is found that the absolute quantity of heat consumed in the process\r\nof converting water into steam is the same at whatever temperature water\r\nmay boil, but that the absolute heat of the steam is greater exactly in\r\nproportion as its sensible heat is less. Thus, steam raised at 212°\r\nFahrenheit under the mean pressure of the atmosphere, and steam raised\r\nat 180° under half the pressure, contain the same quantity of heat, with\r\nthis difference, that the one has more absorbed heat and less sensible\r\nheat than the other. It is evident that, as the same quantity of heat is\r\nrequisite for converting a given weight of water into steam, at whatever\r\ntemperature or under whatever pressure the water may be boiled,\r\ntherefore, in the steam engine, equal weights of steam at a high\r\npressure and a low pressure are produced by the same quantity of fuel;\r\nand whatever the pressure of the steam may be, the consumption of fuel\r\nis proportional to the quantity of water converted into vapour. Steam of\r\nwhatever tension expands on being set free, but the expansion of high\r\npressure steam at the expense of its sensible heat is so great, that the\r\nhand may be plunged into it without injury the instant it issues from\r\nthe orifice of a boiler. The steam becomes hotter by friction in issuing\r\nthrough the orifice which maintains it in its dry form, for there is no\r\ndoubt that high-pressure steam is dry.\r\n\r\nThe elasticity or tension of steam, like that of common air, varies\r\ninversely as its volume—that is, when the space it occupies is doubled,\r\nits elastic force is reduced to one half. The expansion of steam is\r\nindefinite; the smallest quantity of water expanded into vapour will\r\noccupy many millions of cubic feet; a wonderful illustration of the\r\nminuteness of the ultimate particles of matter.\r\n\r\nThe force of steam, tremendous as the lightning itself when\r\nuncontrolled, is merely the result of chemical affinity: it is the\r\nchemical attraction between the particles of carbon, of coal or wood,\r\nand the oxygen of the atmosphere. Mr. Joule has ascertained that a pound\r\nof the best coal when burnt gives sufficient heat to raise the\r\ntemperature of 8086 pounds of water one degree of the Centigrade\r\nthermometer, whence it has been computed by M. Helmholtz that the\r\nchemical force arising from the combustion of that pound of coal is\r\ncapable of lifting a body of one hundred pounds weight to the height of\r\ntwenty miles. That is the _work_ performed by the heat arising from the\r\ncombustion of a pound of coal. In all cases where work is produced by\r\nheat, a quantity of heat proportional to the work done is expended; and\r\nconversely, by the expenditure of a like quantity of work, the same\r\namount of heat may be produced. The equivalence of heat and work is a\r\nlaw of nature. The mechanical force exerted by the steam engine for\r\nexample is exactly proportional to the consumption of heat, nor more nor\r\nless; if we could produce a greater quantity than its equivalent we\r\nshould have perpetual motion, which is impossible. Mechanical engines\r\ngenerate no force. We cannot create force; we can only avail ourselves\r\nof the inexhaustible stores of nature, the lightning, fire, water, wind,\r\nchemical action, &c. The quantity of mechanical power in nature is ever\r\nthe same; it is never increased, it is never diminished, throughout the\r\nwhole circuit of natural powers. The conservation of force is as\r\npermanent and unchangeable as matter. It may be dormant for a time, but\r\nit ever exists. We are unconscious of the enormous dynamic power that is\r\neither active or latent throughout the globe, because we do not attend\r\nto it. By the ebb and flow of the tide alone a power is exerted by which\r\n25,000 cubic miles of water is moved over a quarter of the globe every\r\ntwelve hours; and Professor W. Thomson has computed, by means of\r\nPouillet’s data of solar radiation and Mr. Joule’s mechanical equivalent\r\nof heat, that the mechanical value of the whole energy active and\r\npotential of the disturbances kept up in the ethereal medium by the\r\nvibrations of the solar light within a cubic mile of our atmosphere is\r\nequal to 12,050 times the unit of mechanical force, that is to say,\r\n12,050 times the force that would raise a pound of matter to the height\r\nof one foot, whence some idea may be formed of the vast amount of force\r\nexerted by the sun’s light within the limits of the whole terrestrial\r\natmosphere. (N. 223.)\r\n\r\nThe dynamic energy of the undulations of the solar light gives the\r\nleaves of plants the power of decomposing carbonic acid, and of\r\nseparating the particles of carbon and hydrogen from the oxygen for\r\nwhich they have so strong an affinity. In this operation the undulations\r\nof the sunbeam are extinguished as light and heat, and Professor W.\r\nThomson has proved that the quantity of these undulations thus\r\nextinguished is precisely equal to the potential or quiescent energy\r\nthus created, and that precisely that very quantity of light and heat is\r\nrestored when the plants are burned, whatever state they may be in; and\r\nthat thus, as Mr. George Stephenson[14] has truly and beautifully\r\nobserved, our coal fires and gas lamps restore to our use the light and\r\nheat of the sun of the early geological epochs which have rested as\r\ndormant powers under the seas and mountains for unnumbered ages. The sun\r\nis therefore the source of the mechanical energy of all the heat and\r\nmotion of inanimate things, of all the motions of the heat and light of\r\nfires and artificial flames, and of the heat of all living creatures.\r\nFor animal heat, and weights raised or resistance overcome, are\r\nmechanical effects of the chemical combination of food with oxygen; and\r\nfood is either directly or indirectly vegetable, consequently dependent\r\nupon the sun.\r\n\r\nProfessor Helmholtz of Bonn has put in a strong point of view the\r\nenormous store of force possessed by our system by comparing it with its\r\nequivalent of heat. The force with which the earth moves in its orbit is\r\nsuch, that if brought to rest by a sudden shock, a quantity of heat\r\nwould be generated by the blow equal to that produced by the combustion\r\nof fourteen such earths of solid coal; and supposing the capacity of the\r\nearth for heat as low as that of water, the globe would be heated to\r\n11,200° Cent. It would be quite fused and for the most part reduced to\r\nvapour. If it should fall to the sun, which it would certainly do, the\r\nquantity of heat developed by the shock would be four hundred times as\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nThe application of heat to the various branches of the mechanical and\r\nchemical arts has within the present century effected a greater change\r\nin the condition of man than had been accomplished in any equal period\r\nof his existence. Armed by the expansion and condensation of fluids with\r\na power equal to that of the lightning itself, conquering time and\r\nspace, he flies over plains, and travels on paths cut by human industry\r\neven through mountains with a velocity and smoothness more like\r\nplanetary than terrestrial motion; he crosses the deep in opposition to\r\nwind and tide; by releasing the strain on the cable, he rides at anchor\r\nfearless of the storm; he makes the lightning his messenger; and like a\r\nmagician he raises from the gloomy abyss of the mine the sunbeam of\r\nformer ages to dispel the midnight darkness.\r\n\r\nThe principal phenomena of heat may be illustrated by a comparison with\r\nthose of sound. Their excitation is not only similar but identical, as\r\nin friction and percussion; they are both communicated by contact and\r\nradiation; and Dr. Young observes that the effect of radiant heat in\r\nraising the temperature of a body upon which it falls, resembles the\r\nsympathetic agitation of a string when the sound of another string which\r\nis in unison with it is transmitted through the air. Light, heat, sound,\r\nand the waves of fluids are all subject to the same laws; their\r\nundulatory theories are perfectly similar: hence the interference of two\r\nhot rays must produce cold, that is, they must extinguish one another:\r\ndarkness results from the interference of two undulations of light,\r\nsilence ensues from the interference of two undulations of sound, and\r\nstill water or no tide is the consequence of the interference of two\r\ntides. The propagation of sound, however, requires a much denser medium\r\nthan that of light and heat; its intensity diminishes as the rarity of\r\nthe air increases: so that, at a very small height above the surface of\r\nthe earth, the noise of the tempest ceases, and the thunder is heard no\r\nmore in those boundless regions where the heavenly bodies accomplish\r\ntheir periods in eternal and sublime silence.\r\n\r\nA consciousness of the fallacy of our senses is one of the most\r\nimportant consequences of the study of nature. This study teaches us\r\nthat no object is seen by us in its true place, owing to aberration;\r\nthat the colours of substances are solely the effects of the action of\r\nmatter upon light; and that light itself as well as heat and sound are\r\nnot real beings, but mere motions communicated to our perceptions by the\r\nnerves. The human frame may therefore be regarded as an elastic system,\r\nthe different parts of which are capable of receiving the tremors of\r\nelastic media, and of vibrating in unison with any number of\r\nsuperimposed undulations, all of which have their perfect and\r\nindependent effect. Here our knowledge ends: the mysterious influence of\r\nmatter on mind will in all probability be for ever hid from man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SECTION XXVIII.\r\n\r\nCommon or Static Electricity, or Electricity of Tension—A Dual\r\n  Power—Methods of exciting it—Attraction and\r\n  Repulsion—Conduction—Electrics and\r\n  Non-electrics—Induction—Dielectrics—Tension—Law of the Electric\r\n  Force—Distribution—Laws of Distribution—Heat of Electricity—Electrical\r\n  Light and its Spectrum—Velocity—Atmospheric Electricity—Its\r\n  cause—Electric Clouds—Violent effects of Lightning—Back\r\n  Stroke—Electric Glow—Phosphorescence.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY is a dual power which gives no visible sign of its existence\r\nwhen in equilibrio, but when elicited forces are developed capable of\r\nproducing the most sudden, violent, and destructive effects in some\r\ncases, while in others their action, though generally less energetic, is\r\nof indefinite and uninterrupted continuance. These modifications of the\r\nelectric forces, incidentally depending upon the manner in which they\r\nare excited, present phenomena of great diversity, but yet so connected\r\nas to justify the conclusion that they originate in a common principle.\r\nThe hypothesis of electricity being a fluid is untenable in the present\r\nadvanced state of the science; we only know that it is a force whose\r\naction is twofold; that bodies in one electric state attract, and in\r\nanother repel each other; in the former the electricity is said to be\r\npositive, in the latter negative; and thus regarding it as a force, its\r\nmodes of action come under the laws of mechanics and mathematical\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\nElectricity may be called into activity by the friction of heterogeneous\r\nsubstances, as in the common electrifying machine, by mechanical power,\r\nheat, chemical action, and the influence of magnetism. We are totally\r\nignorant why it is roused from its neutral state by these means, or of\r\nthe manner of its existence in bodies; but when excited it seems to\r\nproduce a molecular polarity or chemical change in the ultimate\r\nparticles of matter.\r\n\r\nThe science is divided into various branches, of which static or common\r\nelectricity comes first under consideration, including that of the\r\natmosphere. Substances in a neutral state neither attract nor repel.\r\nThere is a numerous class called electrics in which the electric\r\nequilibrium is destroyed by friction; then the positive and negative\r\nelectricities are called into action or separated; the positive is\r\nimpelled in one direction, and the negative in another. Electricities of\r\nthe same kind repel, whereas those of different kinds attract each\r\nother. The attractive power is exactly equal to the repulsive power at\r\nequal distances, and when not opposed they coalesce with great rapidity\r\nand violence, producing the electric flash, explosion, and shock; then\r\nthe equilibrium is restored. One kind of electricity cannot be evolved\r\nwithout the evolution of an equal quantity of the opposite kind. Thus\r\nwhen a glass rod is rubbed with a piece of silk, as much positive\r\nelectricity is elicited in the glass as there is negative in the silk.\r\nThe kind of electricity depends more upon the mechanical condition than\r\non the nature of the surface; for when two plates of glass, one polished\r\nand the other rough, are rubbed against each other, the polished surface\r\nacquires positive and the rough negative electricity. The manner in\r\nwhich friction is performed also alters the kind of electricity. Equal\r\nlengths of black and white ribbon applied longitudinally to one another,\r\nand drawn between the finger and thumb so as to rub their surfaces\r\ntogether, become electric. When separated the white ribbon is found to\r\nhave acquired positive electricity, and the black negative; but if the\r\nwhole length of the black ribbon be drawn across the breadth of the\r\nwhite, the black will be positively and the white negatively electric\r\nwhen separated. The friction of the rubber on the glass plate of the\r\nelectrifying machine produces abundance of static electricity. The\r\nfriction of the steam on the valve of an insulated locomotive\r\nsteam-engine produces seven times the quantity of electricity that an\r\nelectrifying machine would do with a plate three feet in diameter,\r\nworked at the rate of 70 revolutions in a minute. Pressure is a source\r\nof electricity which M. Becquerel has found to be common to all bodies;\r\nbut it is necessary to separate them to prevent the reunion of the\r\nelectricities. When two substances of any kind whatever are insulated\r\nand pressed together they assume different electric states, but they\r\nonly show contrary electricities when one of them is a good conductor.\r\nWhen both are good conductors they must be separated with extreme\r\nrapidity to prevent a return to equilibrium. When the separation is very\r\nsudden the tension of the two electricities may be great enough to\r\nproduce light. M. Becquerel attributes the light produced by the\r\ncollision of icebergs to this cause. Iceland spar is made electric by\r\nthe smallest pressure between the finger and the thumb, and retains it\r\nfor a long time. All these circumstances are modified by the temperature\r\nof the substances, the state of their surfaces and that of the\r\natmosphere. Several crystalline bodies become electric when heated,\r\nespecially tourmaline, one end of which acquires positive, and the other\r\nnegative electricity, while the intermediate part is neutral. If the\r\ntourmaline be broken through the middle, each fragment is found to\r\npossess positive electricity at one end and negative at the other.\r\nElectricity is evolved by substances passing from a liquid to a solid\r\nstate, and by chemical action during the production and condensation of\r\nvapour, which is a great source of atmospheric electricity. In short, it\r\nmay be generally stated, that when any cause whatever tends to destroy\r\nmolecular attraction there is a development of electricity; if, however,\r\nthe substances be not immediately separated, there will be an\r\ninstantaneous restoration of equilibrium.\r\n\r\nElectricity may be transferred from one body to another in the same\r\nmanner as heat is communicated, and like it too the body loses by the\r\ntransmission.\r\n\r\nAlthough no substance is altogether impervious to electricity, nor is\r\nthere any that does not offer some resistance to its passage, yet it\r\nmoves with more facility through a certain class of substances called\r\nconductors, such as metals, water, the human body, &c., than through\r\natmospheric air, glass, silk, &c., which are therefore called\r\nnon-conductors. The conducting power is affected both by temperature and\r\nmoisture. The terrestrial globe is a conductor on account of its\r\nmoisture, though dry earth is not. Though metals are the best conductors\r\nof electricity, it affects their molecular structure, for the heat which\r\naccompanies its passage acts as a transverse expansive force, which\r\nincreases their breadth by diminishing their length, as may be seen by\r\npassing electricity through a platinum wire sufficiently thick to resist\r\nfusion. Through air the force is disruptive on account of its\r\nnon-conducting quality, and it seems to act chemically on the oxygen,\r\nproducing the substance known as ozone during its passage through the\r\natmosphere. If a conductor be good and of sufficient size the\r\nelectricity passes imperceptibly but it is shivered to pieces in an\r\ninstant if it be a bad conductor or too small to carry off the charge.\r\nIn that case the physical change is generally a separation of the\r\nparticles, or expansion from the heat, as in trees, where it turns the\r\nmoisture into steam, but all these effects are in proportion to the\r\nobstacles opposed to the freedom of its course.\r\n\r\nBodies surrounded by non-conductors are said to be insulated, because\r\nwhen charged the electricity cannot escape. When that is not the case,\r\nthe electricity is conveyed to the earth: consequently it is impossible\r\nto accumulate electricity in a conducting substance that is not\r\ninsulated. There are a great many substances called non-electrics in\r\nwhich electricity is not sensibly developed by friction unless they be\r\ninsulated, because it is carried off by their conducting power as soon\r\nas elicited. Metals, for example, which are said to be non-electrics can\r\nbe excited, but being conductors they cannot retain this state if in\r\ncommunication with the earth. It is probable that no bodies exist which\r\nare either perfect non-electrics or perfect non-conductors. But it is\r\nevident that electrics must be non-conductors to a certain degree,\r\notherwise they could not retain their electric state.\r\n\r\nA body charged with electricity, although perfectly insulated, so that\r\nall escape of electricity is prevented, tends to produce an electric\r\nstate of the opposite kind in all bodies in its vicinity. Positive\r\nelectricity tends to produce negative electricity in a body near to it,\r\nand _vice versâ_, the effect being greater as the distance diminishes.\r\nThis power which electricity possesses of causing an opposite electrical\r\nstate in its vicinity is called induction. A Leyden jar, for example, or\r\nglass jar coated half way up both outside and in with tin foil, when\r\ncharged with positive electricity, immediately induces negative\r\nelectricity on the tin foil outside. Notwithstanding their strong mutual\r\nattraction they are prevented from coalescing by the glass, which is a\r\nnon-conductor; but if the tin inside and out be connected by a\r\nconducting wire they instantly unite. When a body in either electric\r\nstate is presented to a neutral one, its tendency in consequence of the\r\nlaw of induction is to disturb the condition of the neutral body by\r\ninducing electricity contrary to its own in the adjacent side, and\r\ntherefore an electrical state similar to its own in the remote part.\r\nHence the neutrality of the second body is destroyed by the action of\r\nthe first, and the adjacent parts of the two, having now opposite\r\nelectricities, will attract each other. The attraction between\r\nelectrified and unelectrified substances is a consequence of the altered\r\nstate of their molecules. Induction depends upon the facility with which\r\nthe equilibrium of the neutral body can be overcome, a facility which is\r\nproportional to its conducting power. Consequently the attraction\r\nexerted by an electrified substance upon another substance previously\r\nneutral will be much more energetic if the latter be a conductor than if\r\nit be a non-conductor.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that one body cannot act upon another at a distance without\r\nsome means of communication. Dr. Faraday has proved that the intervening\r\nnon-conducting substance or dielectric has a great influence upon\r\ninduction. Thus the inductive force is greater when sulphur is\r\ninterposed between the two bodies than when shellac is the dielectric,\r\nand greater when shellac is the dielectric than glass, &c. Professor\r\nMatteucci has proved by the following experiment that the intervening\r\nsubstance is itself polarized by induction. A number of plates of mica\r\nin contact were placed between two plates of metal, one of which was\r\nelectrified, so that the whole was charged like a Leyden jar. On\r\nseparating the plates with insulating handles, each plate of mica was\r\nelectrified; one side of it was positive and the other negative, showing\r\ndecidedly a polarization by induction throughout the whole intervening\r\nnon-conducting substance; and thus, although the interposed substance or\r\ndielectric is incapable of conducting the electrical force from one body\r\nto the other, it becomes by induction capable of transmitting it. In the\r\natmosphere induction is transmitted by that of the intervening strata of\r\nair. It is true that induction takes place through the most perfect\r\nvacuum we can make, but there always remains some highly elastic air;\r\nand even if air could be altogether excluded, the ethereal medium\r\ncannot, and it must be capable of induction, since, however attenuated,\r\nit must consist of material atoms, otherwise it would be a nonentity.\r\n\r\nThe law of electrical attraction and repulsion has been determined by\r\nsuspending a needle of gum-lac horizontally by a silk fibre, the needle\r\ncarrying at one end a piece of electrified gold leaf. A globe in the\r\nsame or opposite electrical state when presented to the gold leaf will\r\nrepel or attract it, and will therefore cause the needle to vibrate more\r\nor less rapidly according to the distance of the globe. A comparison of\r\nthe number of oscillations performed in a given time at different\r\ndistances will determine the law of the variation of the electrical\r\nintensity, in the same manner that the force of gravitation is measured\r\nby the oscillations of the pendulum. Coulomb invented an instrument\r\nwhich balances the forces in question by the force of the torsion of a\r\nthread, which consequently measures the intensity; and Sir William Snow\r\nHarris has constructed an instrument with which he has measured the\r\nintensity of the electrical force in terms of the weight requisite to\r\nbalance it. By these methods it has been found that the intensity of\r\nelectrical attraction and repulsion varies inversely as the square of\r\nthe distance. However, the law of repulsive force is liable to great\r\ndisturbances from inductive action, which Sir William Snow Harris has\r\nfound to exist not only between a charged and neutral body, but also\r\nbetween bodies similarly charged; and that, in the latter case, the\r\ninductive process may be indefinitely modified by the various\r\ncircumstances of the quantity and intensity of the electricity and the\r\ndistance between the charged bodies.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of electricity bodies are capable of receiving does not\r\nfollow the proportion of their bulk, but depends principally upon the\r\nform and extent of their surface. It appears from the experiments of Sir\r\nW. S. Harris that a given quantity of electricity, divided between two\r\nperfectly equal and similar bodies, exerts upon external bodies only one\r\nfourth of the attractive force apparent when disposed upon one of them;\r\nand if it be distributed among three equal and similar bodies, the force\r\nis one ninth of that apparent when it is disposed on one of them. Hence,\r\nif the quantity of electricity be the same, the force varies inversely\r\nas the square of the surface on which it is disposed; and if the surface\r\nbe the same, the force varies directly as the square of the quantity of\r\nelectricity. These laws however do not hold when the form of the surface\r\nis changed. A given quantity of electricity disposed on a given surface\r\nhas the greatest intensity when the surface has a circular form, and the\r\nleast intensity when the surface is expanded into an indefinite straight\r\nline. The decrease of intensity seems to arise from some peculiar\r\narrangement of the electricity depending on the extension of the\r\nsurface. It is quite independent of the extent of the edge, the area\r\nbeing the same; for Sir W. S. Harris found that the electrical intensity\r\nof a charged sphere is the same with that of a plane circular area of\r\nthe same superficial extent, and that of a charged cylinder the same as\r\nif it were cut open and expanded into a plane surface.\r\n\r\nThe same able electrician has shown that the attractive force between an\r\nelectrified and a neutral uninsulated body is the same whatever be the\r\nforms of their unopposed parts. Thus two hemispheres attract each other\r\nwith precisely the same force as if they were spheres; and as the force\r\nis as the number of attracting points in operation directly, and as the\r\nsquares of the respective distances inversely, it follows that the\r\nattraction between a mere ring and a circular area is no greater than\r\nthat between two similar rings, and the force between a sphere and an\r\nopposed spherical segment of the same curvature is no greater than that\r\nof two similar segments, each equal to the given segment.\r\n\r\nElectricity may be accumulated to a great extent in insulated bodies,\r\nand so long as it is quiescent it occasions no sensible change in their\r\nproperties. When restrained by the non-conducting power of the\r\natmosphere, its tension or the pressure it exerts is proportional to the\r\ncoercive force of the air. If the pressure be less than the coercive\r\nforce, the electricity is retained; but the instant it exceeds that\r\nforce in any one point it escapes, and that more readily when the air is\r\nattenuated or saturated with moisture, for the resistance of the air is\r\nproportional to the square of its density, but the inductive action of\r\nelectricity on distant bodies is independent of atmospheric pressure.\r\nThe power of retaining electricity depends also on the shape of the\r\ncharged body. It is most easily retained by a sphere, next to that by a\r\nspheroid, but it readily escapes from a point, and a pointed object\r\nreceives it with most facility.\r\n\r\nThe heat produced by the electric shock is proportional to the square of\r\nthe quantity of electricity discharged, and is so intense that it fuses\r\nmetals and volatilizes substances, but its intensity is not felt to its\r\nfull extent on account of the shortness of its duration. It is only\r\naccompanied by light when the electricity is obstructed in its passage\r\nthrough substance.\r\n\r\nElectrical light when analysed by a prism differs very much from solar\r\nlight. Fraunhofer found that, instead of the fixed dark lines, the\r\nspectrum of an electric spark is crossed by numerous bright lines; and\r\nProfessor Wheatstone has observed that the number and position of the\r\nlines differ with the metal from which the spark is taken, and believes\r\nthe spark itself results from the ignition and volatilization of the\r\nmatter of the conductor.\r\n\r\nAccording to the experiments of Sir Humphry Davy, the density of the air\r\nhas an influence on the colour. He passed the electric spark through a\r\nvacuum over mercury, which from green became successively sea-green,\r\nblue, and purple, on admitting different quantities of air. When the\r\nvacuum was made over a fusible alloy of tin and bismuth, the spark was\r\nyellowish and extremely pale. Sir Humphry thence concluded that\r\nelectrical light principally depends upon some properties belonging to\r\nthe ponderable matter through which it passes, and that space is capable\r\nof exhibiting luminous appearances, though it does not contain an\r\nappreciable quantity of matter. He thought that the superficial\r\nparticles of bodies which form vapour, when detached by the repulsive\r\npower of heat, might be equally separated by the electric forces, and\r\nproduce luminous appearances in vacuo by the destruction of their\r\nopposite electric states.\r\n\r\nThe velocity of electricity is so great that the most rapid motion which\r\ncan be produced by art appears to be actual rest when compared with it.\r\nA wheel revolving with celerity sufficient to render its spokes\r\ninvisible, when illuminated by a flash of lightning, is seen for an\r\ninstant with all its spokes distinct, as if it were in a state of\r\nabsolute repose; because, however rapid the rotation may be, the light\r\nhas come and already ceased before the wheel has had time to turn\r\nthrough a sensible space. This beautiful experiment is due to Professor\r\nWheatstone, as well as the following variation of it, which is not less\r\nstriking: If a circular piece of pasteboard be divided into three\r\nsectors, one of which is painted blue, another yellow, and a third red,\r\nit will appear to be white when revolving quickly, because of the\r\nrapidity with which the impressions of the colours succeed each other on\r\nthe retina. But, the instant it is illuminated by an electric spark, it\r\nseems to stand still, and each colour is as distinct as if it were at\r\nrest. This transcendent speed of electricity has been ingeniously\r\nmeasured, as follows, by Professor Wheatstone, who has ascertained that\r\nit much surpasses the velocity of light.\r\n\r\nIn the horizontal diameter of a small disc, fixed on the wall of a\r\ndarkened room, are disposed six small brass balls, well insulated from\r\neach other. An insulated copper wire, half a mile long, is disjointed in\r\nits middle, and also near its two extremities; the six ends thus\r\nobtained are connected with the six-balls on the disc. When an electric\r\ndischarge is sent through the wire by connecting its two extremities,\r\none with the positive, and the other with the negative coating of a\r\nLeyden jar, three sparks are seen on the disc, apparently at the same\r\ninstant. At the distance of about ten feet a small revolving mirror is\r\nplaced so as to reflect these three sparks during its revolution. From\r\nthe extreme velocity of the electricity, it is clear that, if the three\r\nsparks be simultaneous, they will be reflected, and will vanish before\r\nthe mirror has sensibly changed its position, however rapid its rotation\r\nmay be, and they will be seen in a straight line. But if the three\r\nsparks be not simultaneously transmitted to the disc—if one, for\r\nexample, be later than the other two—the mirror will have time to\r\nrevolve through an indefinitely small arc in the interval between the\r\nreflection of the two sparks and that of the single one. However, the\r\nonly indication of this small motion of the mirror will be, that the\r\nsingle spark will not be reflected in the same straight line with the\r\nother two, but a little above or below it, for the reflection of all\r\nthree will still be apparently simultaneous, the time intervening being\r\nmuch too short to be appreciated.\r\n\r\nSince the number of revolutions which the revolving mirror makes in a\r\nsecond is known, and the angular deviation of the reflection of the\r\nsingle spark from the reflection of the other two can be measured, the\r\ntime elapsed between their consecutive reflections can be ascertained.\r\nAnd, as the length of that part of the wire through which the\r\nelectricity has passed is given, its velocity may be found.\r\n\r\nThe number of pulses in a second, requisite to produce a musical note of\r\nany pitch, are known; hence the number of revolutions accomplished by\r\nthe mirror in a given time may be determined from the musical note\r\nproduced by a tooth or peg, in its axis of rotation, striking against a\r\ncard, or from the notes of a siren attached to the axis. It was thus\r\nthat Professor Wheatstone found the mirror which he employed in his\r\nexperiments made 800 revolutions in a second; and, as the angular\r\nvelocity of the reflected image in a revolving mirror is double that of\r\nthe mirror itself, an angular deviation of one degree in the appearance\r\nof the two sparks would indicate an interval of the 576,000th of a\r\nsecond; the deviation of half a degree would, therefore, indicate more\r\nthan the millionth of a second. The use of sound as a measure of\r\nvelocity is a happy illustration of the connexion of the physical\r\nsciences.\r\n\r\nThe earth possesses a powerful electrical tension, and the atmosphere\r\nwhen clear is almost always positively electric. Its electricity is\r\nstronger in winter than in summer, during the day than in the night. The\r\nintensity increases for two or three hours from the time of sunrise,\r\ncomes to a maximum between seven and eight, then decreases towards the\r\nmiddle of the day, arrives at its minimum between one and two, and again\r\naugments as the sun declines till about the time of sunset, after which\r\nit diminishes and continues feeble during the night. The mere\r\ncondensation of vapour is a source of atmospheric electricity; but\r\nalthough it is also produced by the vapour that rises from the surface\r\nof the earth, it is not under all circumstances. M. Pouillet found that\r\nelectricity is only developed when accompanied by chemical action: for\r\nexample, when the water whence the vapour proceeds contains lime, chalk,\r\nor any solid alkali, negative electricity is produced; and when it holds\r\nin solution either gas, acid, or some of the salts, the vapour is\r\npositively electric. Besides, the contact of earth with salt and fresh\r\nwater generates positive electricity, and the contact of fresh and salt\r\ncurrents of water negative, so that the ocean must afford a great supply\r\nto the atmosphere; hence thunderstorms are most frequent near the\r\ncoasts: but as electricity of one kind or another is developed whenever\r\nthe molecules of matter are deranged from their natural state of\r\nequilibrium, there must be many partial variations in the electric state\r\nof the air. When the invisible vapour rises charged with electricity\r\ninto the cold regions of the atmosphere, it is condensed into cloud, in\r\nwhich the tension is increased because the electricity is confined to a\r\nsmaller space; and if the condensation be sufficient to produce drops of\r\nrain, they carry the electricity to the ground, so that in general a\r\nshower is a conductor between the clouds and the earth. When two clouds\r\ncharged with opposite kinds, but of equal tension, approach within a\r\ncertain distance, the intensity increases on the sides of the clouds\r\nthat are nearest to one another; and when the tension is great enough to\r\novercome the coercive pressure of the atmosphere, a discharge takes\r\nplace which causes a flash of lightning, the stroke being given either\r\nby the cloud or the rain. The actual quantity of electricity in any part\r\nof a cloud is extremely small. The intensity of the flash arises from\r\nthe great extent of surface over which it is spread, so that clouds may\r\nbe compared to enormous Leyden jars thinly coated with electricity,\r\nwhich only acquires its intensity by its instantaneous condensation. The\r\nrapid and irregular motions of thunder clouds are probably more owing to\r\nstrong electrical attractions and repulsions among themselves than to\r\ncurrents of air, though both are no doubt concerned in these hostile\r\nmovements. The atmosphere becomes intensely electric on the approach of\r\nrain, hail, snow, sleet, and wind; but it varies afterwards, and the\r\ntransitions are very rapid on the approach of a thunderstorm.\r\n\r\nSince air is a non-conductor, it does not convey the electricity from\r\nthe clouds to the earth, but it acquires from them an opposite kind, and\r\nwhen the tension is very great the force of the electricity becomes\r\nirresistible, and an interchange takes place between the clouds and the\r\nearth; but so rapid is the motion of lightning, that it is difficult to\r\nascertain whether it goes from the clouds to the earth or shoots upwards\r\nfrom the earth to the clouds, though there can be no doubt that it does\r\nboth. In a storm that occurred at Manchester in June 1835, the lightning\r\nwas observed to issue from various points of a road, attended by\r\nexplosions as if pistols had been fired out of the ground, and a man\r\nseems to have been killed by one of these explosions taking place under\r\nhis foot. M. Gay Lussac ascertained that a flash of lightning sometimes\r\ndarts more than three miles in a straight line. A person may be killed\r\nby lightning, although the explosion takes place at a distance of twenty\r\nmiles, by what is called the back stroke. Suppose that the two\r\nextremities of a highly charged cloud hang down towards the earth, they\r\nwill repel the electricity from the earth’s surface if it be of the same\r\nkind with their own, and will attract the other kind; and if a discharge\r\nshould suddenly take place at one end of the cloud, the equilibrium will\r\nbe instantly restored by a flash at that point of the earth which is\r\nunder the other. Though the back stroke is often sufficiently powerful\r\nto destroy life, it is never so terrible in its effects as the direct\r\nstroke, which is often of inconceivable intensity. Instances have\r\noccurred when large masses of iron and stone, and even many feet of a\r\nstone wall, have been carried to a considerable distance by a stroke of\r\nlightning. Rocks and the tops of mountains often bear the marks of\r\nfusion from its intense heat; and occasionally vitreous tubes descending\r\nmany feet into banks of sand mark its path. Dr. Fiedler exhibited\r\nseveral of these fulgorites in London of considerable length, which had\r\nbeen dug out of the sandy plains of Silesia and Eastern Prussia. One\r\nfound at Paderborn was forty feet long. Their ramifications generally\r\nterminate in pools or springs of water below the sand, which are\r\nsupposed to determine the course of the lightning. No doubt the soil and\r\nsubstrata must influence its direction, since it is found by experience\r\nthat places which have been once struck by lightning are often struck\r\nagain. An insulated conductor on the approach of a storm gives out such\r\nquantities of sparks that it is dangerous to approach it, as was fatally\r\nexperienced by Professor Richman at Petersburg, who was struck dead by a\r\nglobe of fire from the extremity of a conductor, while making\r\nexperiments on atmospheric electricity. Copper conductors afford the\r\nbest protection, especially if they expose a broad surface, since\r\nelectricity is conveyed along the surface of bodies. There is no\r\ninstance of an electric cloud of high tension being dispelled by a\r\nconductor, yet those invented by Sir William Snow Harris, and\r\nuniversally employed in the navy, afford a complete protection in the\r\nmost imminent danger. The Shannon, a 50-gun frigate, commanded by the\r\nbrave and lamented Sir William Peel, was enveloped in a thunder-storm\r\nwhen about 90 miles to the north-west of Java. It began at fifty minutes\r\npast four in the afternoon; the ship was driven before the storm, in a\r\nhigh sea, amid streams of vivid lightning, deafening thunder, hail, and\r\nrain. At five o’clock an immense ball of fire covered the maintopgallant\r\nmast, ran up the royal pole, and exploded in the air with a terrific\r\nconcussion, covering all the surrounding space with sparks of electric\r\nlight, which were driven rapidly to leeward by the wind. Fifteen minutes\r\nlater an immense mass of lightning struck the mainmast, attended by a\r\nviolent gust of wind; and another heavy discharge fell on it a quarter\r\nof an hour afterwards. From that time till six o’clock the ship was\r\ncontinually encompassed by sharp forked lightning, accompanied by\r\nincessant peals of thunder. Though actually enveloped in electricity,\r\nand struck three times, neither the hull nor the rigging sustained the\r\nslightest injury.\r\n\r\nWhen the air is rarefied by heat, its coercive power is diminished, so\r\nthat the electricity escapes from the clouds in those lambent diffuse\r\nflashes without thunder so frequent in warm summer evenings; and when\r\nthe atmosphere is highly charged with electricity, it not unfrequently\r\nhappens that electric light, in the form of a star, is seen on the\r\ntopmasts and yard-arms of ships. In 1831 the French officers at Algiers\r\nwere surprised to see brushes of light on the heads of their comrades,\r\nand at the points of their fingers when they held up their hands. This\r\nphenomenon was well known to the ancients, who reckoned it a lucky omen.\r\n\r\nMany substances, in decaying, emit light, which is attributed to\r\nelectricity, such as fish and rotten wood. Oyster-shells, and a variety\r\nof minerals, become phosphorescent at certain temperatures when exposed\r\nto electric shocks or friction: indeed, most of the causes which disturb\r\nmolecular equilibrium give rise to phosphoric phenomena. The minerals\r\npossessing this property are generally coloured or imperfectly\r\ntransparent; and, though the colour of this light varies in different\r\nsubstances, it has no fixed relation to the colour of the mineral. An\r\nintense heat entirely destroys this property, and the phosphorescent\r\nlight developed by heat has no connexion with light produced by\r\nfriction; for Sir David Brewster observed that bodies deprived of the\r\nfaculty of emitting the one are still capable of giving out the other.\r\nAmong the bodies which generally become phosphorescent when exposed to\r\nheat, there are some specimens which do not possess this property;\r\nwherefore phosphorescence cannot be regarded as an essential character\r\nof the minerals possessing it. Sulphuret of calcium, known as Canton’s\r\nphosphorus, and the sulphuret of barium, or Bologna stone, possess the\r\nphosphorescent property in an eminent degree.\r\n\r\nMultitudes of fish are endowed with the power of emitting light at\r\npleasure, no doubt to enable them to pursue their prey at depths where\r\nthe sunbeams cannot penetrate. Flashes of light are frequently seen to\r\ndart along a shoal of herrings or pilchards; and the Medusa tribes are\r\nnoted for their phosphorescent brilliancy, many of which are extremely\r\nsmall, and so numerous as to make the wake of a vessel look like a\r\nstream of silver. Nevertheless, the luminous appearance which is\r\nfrequently observed in the sea during the summer months cannot always be\r\nattributed to marine animalculæ, as the following narrative will show:—\r\n\r\nCaptain Bonnycastle, coming up the Gulf of St. Lawrence on the 7th of\r\nSeptember, 1826, was roused by the mate of the vessel in great alarm\r\nfrom an unusual appearance. It was a starlight night, when suddenly the\r\nsky became overcast in the direction of the high land, and an\r\ninstantaneous and intensely vivid light, resembling the aurora, shot out\r\nof the hitherto gloomy and dark sea on the lee bow, which was so\r\nbrilliant that it lighted everything distinctly even to the mast-head.\r\nThe light spread over the whole sea between the two shores, and the\r\nwaves, which before had been tranquil, now began to be agitated. Captain\r\nBonnycastle describes the scene as that of a blazing sheet of awful and\r\nmost brilliant light. A long and vivid line of light, superior in\r\nbrightness to the parts of the sea not immediately near the vessel,\r\nshowed the base of the high, frowning, and dark land abreast; the sky\r\nbecame lowering and more intensely obscure. Long tortuous lines of light\r\nshowed immense numbers of very large fish darting about as if in\r\nconsternation. The sprit-sail yard and mizen-boom were lighted by the\r\nglare, as if gaslights had been burning directly below them; and until\r\njust before daybreak, at four o’clock, the most minute objects were\r\ndistinctly visible. Day broke very slowly, and the sun rose of a fiery\r\nand threatening aspect. Rain followed. Captain Bonnycastle caused a\r\nbucket of this fiery water to be drawn up; it was one mass of light when\r\nstirred by the hand, and not in sparks as usual, but in actual\r\ncoruscations. A portion of the water preserved its luminosity for seven\r\nnights. On the third night, the scintillations of the sea reappeared;\r\nthe sun went down very singularly, exhibiting in its descent a double\r\nsun; and, when only a few degrees high, its spherical figure changed\r\ninto that of a long cylinder, which reached the horizon. In the night\r\nthe sea became nearly as luminous as before, but on the fifth night the\r\nappearance entirely ceased. Captain Bonnycastle did not think it\r\nproceeded from animalculæ, but imagined it might be some compound of\r\nphosphorus, suddenly evolved and disposed over the surface of the sea.\r\nIt had probably been that peculiar form of electricity known as the glow\r\ndischarge, of which the author once saw a very remarkable instance.\r\n\r\nM. E. Becquerel assures us that almost all substances are phosphorescent\r\nafter being exposed to the sun if instantly withdrawn into darkness, and\r\nthat it depends upon the arrangement of the particles and not upon\r\nchemical action. The salts of uranium give the same kind of\r\nphosphorescent light as that produced by the violet rays of the solar\r\nspectrum. A solution of the bisulphate of quinine emits a yellow\r\nphosphorescent light, whereas the fluorescent light of that liquid is\r\nblue. The colours of these two kinds of light are generally\r\ncomplementary to one another.\r\n\r\nPhosphorescence is probably more or less concerned in some, at least, of\r\na series of very curious experiments made by M. Niepcé de Saint-Victor,\r\non what he calls the saturation of substances with light. It has long\r\nbeen known that, if a person in an intensely dark room should expose his\r\narm to the sun through a hole in a window-shutter, it will shine on\r\nbeing drawn into the darkness. Now, M. de Saint-Victor found that if an\r\nengraving be exposed for a certain time to the sun, and instantly\r\nbrought into darkness, it will make a photographic impression on a\r\ncollodion or argentine surface, and that anything written or drawn with\r\ntartaric acid, or a solution of the salts of uranium, in large\r\ncharacters, is reproduced even at a small distance from a sensitive\r\nsurface. It may be presumed that the light communicates its vibrations\r\nto the surfaces exposed to it with sufficient force to enable them to\r\ndisturb the unstable equilibrium of such sensitive substances as\r\ncollodion or the argentine salts. M. de Saint-Victor has shown that\r\ntartaric acid, which is readily impressed by sunlight, is neither\r\nfluorescent nor phosphorescent, whence he concludes that his experiments\r\nare independent of both of these modes of action. Uranium appears to\r\nhave very peculiar properties: its salts are strongly luminous when\r\nexposed to the sun; they are very fluorescent; and the crystallized\r\nazitote of uranium becomes phosphorescent by percussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION XXIX.\r\n\r\nVoltaic Electricity—The Voltaic Battery—Intensity—Quantity—Static\r\n  Electricity, and Electricity in Motion—Luminous Effects—Mr.\r\n  Grove on the Electric Arc and Light—Decomposition of Water—Formation\r\n  of Crystals by Voltaic Electricity—Photo-galvanic\r\n  Engraving—Conduction—Heat of Voltaic Electricity—Electric Fish.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLTAIC or Dynamic electricity is elicited by the force of chemical\r\naction. It is connected with some of the most brilliant periods of\r\nBritish science, from the splendid discoveries to which it led Sir\r\nHumphry Davy and Dr. Faraday.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, while Galvani, Professor of Anatomy in Bologna, was making\r\nexperiments on electricity, he was surprised to see convulsive motions\r\nin the limbs of a dead frog accidentally lying near the machine during\r\nan electrical discharge. Though a similar action had been noticed long\r\nbefore his time, he was so much struck with this singular phenomenon,\r\nthat he examined all the circumstances carefully, and at length found\r\nthat convulsions take place when the nerve and muscle of a frog are\r\nconnected by a metallic conductor. This excited the attention of all\r\nEurope; and it was not long before Volta, Professor at Pavia, showed\r\nthat the mere contact of different bodies is sufficient to disturb\r\nelectrical equilibrium, and that a current of electricity flows in one\r\ndirection through a circuit of three conducting substances. From this he\r\nwas led, by acute reasoning and experiment, to the construction of the\r\nVoltaic pile, which, in its early form, consisted of alternate discs of\r\nzinc and copper, separated by pieces of wet cloth, the extremities being\r\nconnected by wires. This simple apparatus, perhaps the most wonderful\r\ninstrument that has been invented by the ingenuity of man, by divesting\r\nelectricity of its sudden and uncontrollable violence, and giving in a\r\ncontinued stream a greater quantity at a diminished intensity, has\r\nexhibited that force under a new and manageable form, possessing powers\r\nthe most astonishing and unexpected. The expression current has no\r\nrelation to a fluid, which is now considered to be as inconsistent with\r\nthe phenomena of dynamic as with static electricity. It was shown by\r\nGrotthus that the transmission of Voltaic electricity through liquids\r\nconsists of a series of chemical affinities acting in definite\r\ndirections; and Mr. Grove, from an examination of its action on the\r\nvarious kinds of matter, has come to the same conclusion. Indeed it is\r\nnow the generally received opinion that a current of electricity is\r\nmerely a continuous transmission of chemical affinity from particle to\r\nparticle of the substance through which it is passing, and consequently\r\nthat it is a continuous transmission of force. As the Voltaic battery\r\nhas become one of the most important engines of physical research, some\r\naccount of its present condition may not be out of place.\r\n\r\nThe disturbance of electric equilibrium, and a development of\r\nelectricity, invariably accompany the chemical action of a fluid on\r\nmetallic substances, and the electricity is most plentiful when that\r\naction occasions oxidation. Metals vary in the quantity of electricity\r\nafforded by their combination with oxygen. But the greatest abundance is\r\ndeveloped by the oxidation of zinc by weak sulphuric acid. And, in\r\nconformity with the law that one kind of electricity cannot be evolved\r\nwithout an equal quantity of the other being brought into activity, it\r\nis found that the acid is positively, and the zinc negatively electric.\r\nIt has not yet been ascertained why equilibrium is not restored by the\r\ncontact of these two substances, which are both conductors, and in\r\nopposite electrical states. However, the electrical and chemical changes\r\nare so connected, that, unless equilibrium be restored, the action of\r\nthe acid will go on languidly, or stop as soon as a certain quantity of\r\nelectricity is accumulated in it. Equilibrium, nevertheless, will be\r\nrestored, and the action of the acid will be continuous, if a plate of\r\ncopper be placed in contact with the zinc, both being immersed in the\r\nfluid; for the copper, not being acted upon by the acid, will serve as a\r\nconductor to convey the positive electricity from the acid to the zinc,\r\nand will at every instant restore the equilibrium, and then the\r\noxidation of the zinc will go on rapidly. Thus three substances are\r\nconcerned in forming a Voltaic circuit, but it is indispensable that one\r\nof them should be a fluid. The electricity so obtained will be very\r\nfeeble in overcoming resistances offered by imperfect conductors\r\ninterposed in the circuit, or by very long wires, but it may be\r\naugmented by increasing the number of plates. In the common Voltaic\r\nbattery, the electricity which the fluid has acquired from the first\r\nplate of zinc exposed to its action is taken up by the copper plate\r\nbelonging to the second pair, and transferred to the second zinc plate,\r\nwith which it is connected. The second plate of zinc, possessing equal\r\npowers, and acting in conformity with the first, having thus acquired a\r\nlarger portion of electricity than its natural share, communicates a\r\nlarger quantity to the fluid in the second cell. This increased quantity\r\nis again transferred to the next pair of plates; and thus every\r\nsucceeding alternation is productive of a further increase in the\r\nquantity of the electricity developed. This action, however, would stop\r\nunless a vent were given to the accumulated electricity, by establishing\r\na communication between the positive and negative poles of the battery\r\nby means of wires attached to the extreme plate at each end. When the\r\nwires are brought into contact, the Voltaic circuit is completed, the\r\nelectricities meet and neutralize each other, producing the shock and\r\nother electrical phenomena; and then the electric current continues to\r\nflow uninterruptedly in the circuit, as long as the chemical action\r\nlasts. The stream of positive electricity flows from the zinc to the\r\ncopper. The construction and power of the Voltaic battery have been much\r\nimproved of late years, but the most valuable improvement is the\r\nconstant battery of Professor Daniell. In all batteries of the ordinary\r\nconstruction, the power, however energetic at first, rapidly diminishes,\r\nand ultimately becomes very feeble. Professor Daniell found that this\r\ndiminution of power is occasioned by the adhesion of the evolved\r\nhydrogen to the surface of the copper, and by the precipitation of the\r\nsulphate formed by the action of the acid on the zinc. He prevents the\r\nlatter by interposing between the copper and the zinc, in the cell\r\ncontaining the liquid, a membrane which, without impeding the electric\r\ncurrent, prevents the transfer of the salt; and the former, by placing\r\nbetween the copper and the membrane solution of sulphate of copper,\r\nwhich being reduced by the hydrogen prevents the adhesion of this gas to\r\nthe metallic surface. Each element of the battery consists of a hollow\r\ncylinder of copper, in the axis of which is placed a cylindrical rod of\r\nzinc; between the zinc and the copper a membranous bag is placed, which\r\ndivides the cell into two portions, the inner of which is filled with\r\ndilute acid, and the one nearer the copper is supplied with crystals of\r\nthe sulphate of that metal. The battery consists of several of these\r\nelementary cells connected together by metallic wires, the zinc rod of\r\none with the copper cylinder of that next to it. The zinc rods are\r\namalgamated, so that local action, which, in ordinary cases, is so\r\ndestructive of the zinc, does not take place, and no chemical action is\r\nmanifested unless the circuit be completed. The rods are easily\r\ndetached, and others substituted for them when worn out. This battery,\r\nwhich possesses considerable power, and is constant in its effects for a\r\nvery long time, is greatly superior to all former arrangements, either\r\nas an instrument of research, or for exhibiting the ordinary phenomena\r\nof Voltaic electricity.\r\n\r\nA battery charged with water alone, instead of acid, is constant in its\r\naction, but the quantity of electricity it develops is comparatively\r\nvery small. Mr. Cross, of Broomfield in Somersetshire, kept a battery of\r\nthis kind in full force during twelve months. M. Becquerel had invented\r\nan instrument for comparing the intensities of the different kinds of\r\nelectricity by means of weights; but, as it is impossible to make the\r\ncomparison with Voltaic electricity produced by the ordinary batteries,\r\non account of the perpetual variation to which the intensity of the\r\ncurrent is liable, he has constructed a battery which affords a\r\ncontinued stream of electricity of uniform power, but it is also of very\r\nfeeble force. The current is produced by the chemical combination of an\r\nacid with an alkali.\r\n\r\nMetallic contact is not necessary for the production of Voltaic\r\nelectricity, which is entirely due to chemical action. The intensity of\r\nthe Voltaic electricity is in proportion to the intensity of the\r\naffinities concerned in its production, and the quantity produced is in\r\nproportion to the quantity of matter which has been chemically active\r\nduring its evolution. Dr. Faraday considers this definite production to\r\nbe one of the strongest proofs that electricity is of chemical origin.\r\n\r\nGalvanic or Voltaic electricity is manifested by two continuous forces\r\nor currents passing in opposite directions through the circuit: the zinc\r\nis the positive end or pole of the battery, and the copper the negative.\r\n\r\nVoltaic electricity is distinguished by two marked characters. Its\r\nintensity increases with the number of plates, its quantity with the\r\nextent of their surfaces. The most intense concentration of force is\r\ndisplayed by a numerous series of large plates: light and heat are\r\ncopiously evolved, and chemical decomposition is accomplished with\r\nextraordinary energy; whereas the electricity from one pair of plates,\r\nwhatever their size may be, is so feeble that it gives no sign either of\r\nattraction or repulsion. Common or static electricity is of greater\r\nintensity and has a greater power of overcoming resistance than Voltaic\r\nelectricity, but it acts upon a smaller quantity of matter. However, by\r\ndiminishing the size of the plates, and increasing their number, the\r\nintensity of a battery may be increased till it becomes equal to that of\r\nthe electrical machine.\r\n\r\nThe action of Voltaic electricity differs in some respects materially\r\nfrom that of the ordinary kind. When a quantity of common electricity is\r\naccumulated, the restoration of equilibrium is attended by an\r\ninstantaneous violent explosion, accompanied by the development of\r\nlight, heat, and sound. The concentrated power of the electricity forces\r\nits way through every obstacle, disrupting and destroying the cohesion\r\nof the particles of the bodies through which it passes, and occasionally\r\nincreasing its destructive effects by the conversion of fluids into\r\nsteam from the intensity of the momentary heat, as when trees are torn\r\nto pieces by a stroke of lightning. Even the vivid light which marks the\r\npath of the electricity is probably owing in part to the sudden\r\ncompression of the air and the rapidity of its passage. But the instant\r\nequilibrium is restored by this energetic action the whole is at an end.\r\nOn the contrary, when an accumulation takes place in a Voltaic battery,\r\nequilibrium is restored the moment the circuit is completed. But so far\r\nis the electric stream from being exhausted, that it continues to flow\r\nsilently and invisibly in an uninterrupted current supplied by a\r\nperpetual reproduction. And, although its action on bodies is neither so\r\nsudden nor so intense as that of common electricity, yet it acquires\r\nsuch power from constant accumulation and continued action, that it\r\nultimately surpasses the energy of the other. The two kinds of\r\nelectricity differ in no circumstance more than in the development of\r\nheat. Instead of a momentary evolution, the circulation of the Voltaic\r\nelectricity is accompanied by a continued development of heat, lasting\r\nas long as the circuit is complete, without producing either light or\r\nsound. Its intensity from a very powerful battery is greater than that\r\nof any heat that can be obtained by artificial means, so that it fuses\r\nsubstances which resist the action of the most powerful furnaces. The\r\ntemperature of every part of a Voltaic battery itself is raised during\r\nits activity. With the greater number of metals Mr. Grove found that the\r\npositive terminal or pole is hotter than the negative.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Joule, the quantity of heat generated in a unit of time\r\nis proportional to the strength of the current, and when a galvanic\r\ncurrent is employed in chemical analysis, the heat in the entire circuit\r\ngenerated in a unit of time is equal to the work expended in producing\r\nit, minus that employed in the analysis. In fact, a current of\r\nelectricity cannot pass through a homogeneous conductor without\r\ngenerating heat in overcoming resistance, an effect proved by Mr. Joule\r\nto be proportional to the square of the force of the current, and the\r\nsame in whatever direction the current may be flowing. Any other thermal\r\naction that can take place must depend upon the heterogeneousness of the\r\ncircuit, and must be reversible with the current. For example, if a\r\nsemicircle of bismuth be joined to a semicircle of antimony, an electric\r\ncurrent in passing through it produces cold where it passes from the\r\nbismuth to the antimony by absorption, and heat where it passes from the\r\nantimony to the bismuth.\r\n\r\nThe transit of the electricity from pole to pole is accompanied by\r\nlight, and in consequence of the continuous current sparks occur every\r\ntime the contact of the wires is either broken or renewed; but\r\nconsiderable intensity is requisite to enable the electricity to force\r\nits way through atmospheric air or gas. Both its length and colour are\r\naffected by the density of the medium through which it passes. If the\r\nmedium be gradually rarefied the discharge increases from a spark to a\r\nluminous glow, differing in colour in different gases, but white in air.\r\nWhen very much attenuated a discharge may be made to pass across 6 or 7\r\nfeet of space, while in air of the ordinary density it will not pass\r\nthrough an inch. In rarefied gas it resembles the Aurora by its\r\ncontinuous flashes. When the battery is powerful the luminous effects\r\nare very brilliant.\r\n\r\nThe most splendid artificial light known is produced by fixing pencils\r\nof charcoal at the extremities of the wires, and bringing them into\r\ncontact. This light is the more remarkable as it is independent of\r\ncombustion, since the charcoal suffers no apparent change, and,\r\nlikewise, because it is equally vivid in such gases as do not contain\r\noxygen. It depends upon the molecular arrangement of the charcoal; for\r\nMr. Grove observes that “carbon in a transparent crystalline state, as\r\ndiamond, is as perfect a non-conductor as we know, while in an opaque\r\namorphous state, as graphite or charcoal, it is one of the best\r\nconductors: thus in one state it transmits light and stops electricity,\r\nin the other it transmits electricity and stops light. It is a\r\ncircumstance worthy of remark, that the arrangement of molecules which\r\nrenders a solid body capable of transmitting light is most unfavourable\r\nto the transmission of electricity, transparent solids being very\r\nimperfect conductors of electricity; so all gases readily transmit\r\nlight, but are amongst the worst conductors of electricity, if indeed\r\nthey can be said to conduct it at all. The fact that the molecular\r\nstructure or arrangement of a body influences, indeed I may say\r\ndetermines, its conducting power, is by no means explained by the theory\r\nof a fluid; but if electricity be only a transmission of force or\r\nmotion, the influence of the molecular state is just what would be\r\nexpected.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Wheatstone, by fixing metallic points at the extremities of\r\nthe wires or poles, has found that the appearance of the spectrum of the\r\nvoltaic arc or vivid flame that is seen between the terminals of a\r\nbattery, depends, as in static electricity, upon the metal from whence\r\nit is taken. The spectrum of that from mercury consists of seven\r\ndefinite rays, separated from each other by dark intervals; these\r\nvisible rays are two orange lines close together, a bright green line,\r\ntwo blueish-green lines near each other, a very bright purple line, and,\r\nlastly, a blue line. It is the same when it passes through carbonic acid\r\ngas, oxygen gas, air, or vacuum. The light from zinc, cadmium, tin,\r\nbismuth, and lead, in a melted state, gives similar results; but the\r\nnumber, position, and colour of the lines vary so much in each case, and\r\nthe appearances are so different, that the metals may easily be\r\ndistinguished from one another by this mode of investigation. The\r\nelectric spark is considered by M. Angström to be the overlapping of two\r\nspectra, one of which belongs to the metal, and the other to the gas\r\nthrough which the spark passes, and that the bright lines vary with the\r\ngas as well as with the metal. In an oxygen spectrum the greatest number\r\nof bright lines occur in the blue and violet, in nitrogen in the green\r\nand yellow, and in hydrogen in the red. These effects must necessarily\r\nbe connected with the chemical and thermal properties of the gases.\r\n\r\nMr. Grove considers that the colour of the voltaic arc, or flame, which\r\nappears between the poles of a very powerful battery, depends upon the\r\nsubstance of the metal from whence it proceeds and on the medium through\r\nwhich it passes. The spark from zinc is blue, from silver it is green,\r\nfrom iron it is red and scintillating—precisely the colours afforded by\r\nthese metals in their ordinary combustion. But the colour varies also\r\nwith the medium through which the light passes, for when the medium is\r\nchanged a change takes place in the colour, showing an affection of the\r\nintervening matter. A portion of the metal terminals or poles is\r\nactually transmitted with every electrical or Voltaic discharge, whence\r\nMr. Grove concludes that the electrical discharge arises, at least in\r\npart, from an actual repulsion and severance of the electrified matter\r\nitself, which flies off at the points of least resistance. He observes\r\nthat “the phenomena attending the electric spark or Voltaic arc tends to\r\nmodify considerably our previous idea of the nature of the electric\r\nforce as a producer of ignition and combustion. The Voltaic arc is\r\nperhaps, strictly speaking, neither ignition nor combustion. It is not\r\nsimply ignition; because the matter of the terminals is not merely\r\nbrought to a state of incandescence, but is physically separated, and\r\npartially transferred from one terminal to another, much of it being\r\ndissipated in a vaporous state. It is not combustion; for the phenomena\r\nwill take place independently of atmospheric air, oxygen gas, or any of\r\nthe bodies usually called supporters of combustion; combustion being in\r\nfact chemical union attended with heat and light. In the Voltaic arc we\r\nmay have no chemical union, for if the experiment be performed in an\r\nexhausted receiver, or in nitrogen, the substance forming the terminals\r\nis condensed and precipitated upon the interior of the vessel, in,\r\nchemically speaking, an unaltered state. Thus, to take a very striking\r\nexample, if the Voltaic discharge be taken between zinc terminals in an\r\nexhausted receiver, a fine black powder of zinc is deposited on the\r\nsides of the receiver; this can be collected, and takes fire readily in\r\nair by being touched with a match, or ignited wire, instantly burning\r\ninto white oxide of zinc. To an ordinary observer the zinc would appear\r\nto be burned twice—first in the receiver, where the phenomenon presents\r\nall the appearance of combustion, and, secondly, in the real combustion\r\nin air. With iron the experiment is equally instructive. Iron is\r\nvolatilized by the Voltaic arc in nitrogen, or in an exhausted receiver;\r\nand when a scarcely perceptible film has lined the receiver, if it be\r\nwashed with an acid, it then gives, with ferrocyanide of potassium, the\r\nPrussian-blue precipitate. In this case we readily distil iron, a metal\r\nby ordinary means _fusible_ only at a very high temperature.”\r\n\r\nAnother strong evidence that the Voltaic discharge consists of the\r\nmaterial itself of which the terminals are composed, is the peculiar\r\nrotation which is observed in the light when iron is employed, the\r\nmagnetic character of this metal causing its particles to rotate by the\r\ninfluence of the Voltaic current. In short, Mr. Grove concludes that,\r\nalthough it would be hasty to assert that the electrical disruptive\r\ndischarge can in no case take place without the terminals being\r\naffected, yet he had met with no instance of such a result, provided the\r\ndischarge had been sufficiently prolonged, and the terminals in such a\r\nstate as could be expected to render manifest slight changes![15]\r\n\r\nSome years ago Mr. Grove discovered that the electrical discharge\r\npossesses certain phases or fits of an alternate character, forming\r\nrings of alternate oxidation and deoxidation on metallic surfaces. A\r\nhighly polished silver plate in an air-pump was connected with the pole\r\nof a powerful inductive battery, while a fine metallic wire, or even a\r\ncommon sewing needle, was fixed at the other pole, and so arranged as to\r\nbe perpendicular to the silver plate, and very near, but not touching\r\nit. By means of this apparatus the electrical discharge could be sent\r\nthrough any kind of rarefied media. In some of the experiments a series\r\nof concentric coloured rings of oxide alternating with rings of polished\r\nor unoxidated silver were formed on the plate under the point of the\r\nneedle or wire. When the plate was previously coated with a film of\r\noxide, the oxide was removed in concentric spaces by the discharge, and\r\nincreased on the alternate ones, showing an alternate positive and\r\nnegative electricity, or electricity of an opposite character in the\r\nsame discharge.\r\n\r\nWhen the silver plate was polished the centre of the rings formed on it\r\nwas yellow-green surrounded by blue-green; then a ring of polished\r\nsilver, followed by a crimson ring with a slight orange tint on the\r\ninner side and deep purple on the outer; lastly the indication of a\r\npolished one. When the air-pump was filled with attenuated olefiant gas\r\nthe rings were precisely the same with those seen in thin plates; hence\r\nthe effect is the same as that produced by the interference of light. In\r\nthese experiments the luminous appearance extended from three quarters\r\nof an inch to an inch round the point of the needle or wire.\r\n\r\nWhen the silver plate was connected with the negative pole of the\r\nbattery a polished point appeared upon it opposite the needle,\r\nsurrounded by a dusky ill-defined areola of a brown colour tinged with\r\npurple when viewed in one direction, and greenish-white when seen in\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nIn the present year Mr. Gassiot, Vice-President of the Royal Society,\r\nhas shown that the stratified character of the electric discharge is\r\nremarkably developed in the Torricellian vacuum. Among the various\r\nexperiments made by that gentleman two may be selected as strongly\r\nillustrative of this new and singular property of electrical light.\r\n\r\nIn a closed glass tube about an inch internal diameter and 38 inches\r\nlong, in which a vacuum had been made, two platinum wires were\r\nhermetically sealed, 32 inches apart, and connected with the poles of an\r\ninductive battery. The luminous appearance at the two poles was very\r\ndifferent when electricity passed through the wires. A glow surrounded\r\nthe negative pole, and in close approximation to the glow a well-defined\r\ndark space appeared, while from the positive pole or wire the light\r\nproceeded in a stream; but unless the charge be great or the tube short,\r\nthe stream will not extend to the black band, which is totally different\r\nfrom the intervening space. When discharges of electricity were sent\r\nthrough this vacuum tube a series of bands or stratifications were\r\nformed which were concave towards the positive pole; and as in the\r\nchanges in making and breaking the circuit the electricity emanates from\r\nthe different terminals or wires, their concavities were in opposite\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nWhen instead of platinum wires narrow tinfoil coatings were placed round\r\nthe exterior of the glass tube and connected with the wires of the\r\nbattery, brilliant stratifications filled the interior of the tube\r\nbetween the foil coatings, but no dark band appeared. At present Mr.\r\nGassiot is inclined to believe that the dark band is due to\r\ninterference; but that the stratifications arise from pulsations or\r\nimpulses of a force acting in a highly attenuated but resisting medium,\r\nfor even with the best air-pumps it is impossible to make a perfect\r\nvoid; he is still occupied with experiments on this new subject, and no\r\ndoubt will obtain very remarkable results, of which none can be more\r\nextraordinary than his discovery of the powerful influence of the magnet\r\non this electric light. The stratifications are formed in rapid\r\nsuccession in the tube with platinum wires and are turned different\r\nways, but they can be separated at any part of the tube by the pole of a\r\nmagnet round which the whole stratifications have a tendency to revolve.\r\nIn the second experiment, where the tinfoil was used, the discharge was\r\ndivided in two by the pole of a magnet, and the two parts had a tendency\r\nto rotate round the magnet in opposite directions.\r\n\r\nVoltaic electricity is a powerful agent in chemical analysis. When\r\ntransmitted through conducting fluids, it separates them into their\r\nconstituent parts, which it conveys in an invisible state through a\r\nconsiderable space or quantity of liquid to the poles, where they come\r\ninto evidence. Numerous instances might be given, but the decomposition\r\nof water is perhaps the most simple and elegant. Suppose a glass tube\r\nfilled with water, and corked at both ends; if one of the wires of an\r\nactive Voltaic battery be made to pass through one cork, and the other\r\nthrough the other cork, into the water, so that the extremities of the\r\ntwo wires shall be opposite and about a quarter of an inch asunder,\r\nchemical action will immediately take place, and gas will continue to\r\nrise from the extremities of both wires till the water has vanished. If\r\nan electric spark be then sent through the tube, the water will\r\nreappear. By arranging the experiment so as to have the gas given out by\r\neach wire separately, it is found that water consists of two volumes of\r\nhydrogen and one of oxygen. The hydrogen is given out at the positive\r\nwire of the battery, and the oxygen at the negative. The oxides are also\r\ndecomposed; the oxygen appears at the positive pole, and the metal at\r\nthe negative. The decomposition of the alkalies and earths by Sir\r\nHumphry Davy formed a remarkable era in the history of science. Soda,\r\npotash, lime, magnesia, and other substances heretofore considered to be\r\nsimple bodies incapable of decomposition, were resolved by electric\r\nagency into their constituent parts, and proved to be metallic oxides,\r\nby that illustrious philosopher. All chemical changes produced by\r\nelectricity are accomplished on the same principle; and it appears that,\r\nin general, combustible substances, metals, and alkalies go to the\r\nnegative wire, while acids and oxygen are evolved at the positive. The\r\ntransfer of these substances to the poles is not the least wonderful\r\neffect of the Voltaic battery. Though the poles be at a considerable\r\ndistance from one another, nay, even in separate vessels, if a\r\ncommunication be only established by a quantity of wet thread, as the\r\ndecomposition proceeds the component parts pass through the thread in an\r\ninvisible state, and arrange themselves at their respective poles.\r\nAccording to Dr. Faraday, electro-chemical decomposition is simply a\r\ncase of the preponderance of one set of chemical affinities more\r\npowerful in their nature over another set which are less powerful. And\r\nin electro-chemical action of any kind produced by a continuous current,\r\nthe amount of action in a given time is nearly, if not rigorously,\r\nproportional to the strength of the current. The great efficacy of\r\nVoltaic electricity in chemical decomposition arises not from its\r\ntension, but from the quantity set in motion and the continuance of its\r\naction. Its agency appears to be most exerted on fluids and substances\r\nwhich by conveying the electricity partially and imperfectly impede its\r\nprogress. But it is now proved to be as efficacious in the composition\r\nas in the decomposition or analysis of bodies.\r\n\r\nIt had been observed that, when metallic solutions are subjected to\r\ngalvanic action, a deposition of metal, sometimes in the form of minute\r\ncrystals, takes place on the negative wire. By extending this principle,\r\nand employing a very feeble Voltaic action, M. Becquerel has succeeded\r\nin forming crystals of a great proportion of the mineral substances,\r\nprecisely similar to those produced by nature. The electric state of\r\nmetallic veins makes it possible that many natural crystals may have\r\ntaken their form from the action of electricity bringing their ultimate\r\nparticles, when in solution, within the narrow sphere of molecular\r\nattraction. Both light and motion favour crystallization. Crystals which\r\nform in different liquids are generally more abundant on the side of the\r\njar exposed to the light; and it is well known that still water, cooled\r\nbelow 32°, starts into crystals of ice the instant it is agitated. A\r\nfeeble action is alone necessary, provided it be continued for a\r\nsufficient time. Crystals formed rapidly are generally imperfect and\r\nsoft, and M. Becquerel found that even years of constant Voltaic action\r\nwere necessary for the crystallization of some of the hard substances.\r\nIf this law be general, how many ages may be required for the formation\r\nof a diamond!\r\n\r\nThe deposition of metal from a metallic solution by galvanic electricity\r\nhas been most successfully applied to the arts of plating and gilding,\r\nas well as to the more delicate process of copying medals and copper\r\nplates. Indeed, not medals only, but any object of art or nature, may be\r\ncoated with precipitated metal, provided it be first covered with the\r\nthinnest film of plumbago, which renders a non-conductor sufficiently\r\nconducting to receive the metal. Photo-galvanic engraving depends upon\r\nthis. Gelatine mixed with bichromate of potash, nitrate of silver, and\r\niodide of potassium, is spread over a plate of glass, and when dry a\r\npositive print is laid upon it with its face downwards, which, when\r\nexposed to the sun, leaves its impression. When soaked in water the\r\ngelatine swells around all those parts where the light had fallen, thus\r\nforming an intaglio, a cast of which is taken in gutta-percha, which is\r\nthen coated with copper by the electro process, whence a copper plate in\r\nrelief is obtained.\r\n\r\nStatic electricity, on account of its high tension, passes through water\r\nand other liquids as soon as it is formed, whatever the length of its\r\ncourse may be. Voltaic electricity, on the contrary, is weakened by the\r\ndistance it has to traverse. Pure water is a very bad conductor; but ice\r\nabsolutely stops a current of Voltaic electricity altogether, whatever\r\nbe the power of the battery, although static or common electricity has\r\nsufficient power to overcome its resistance. Dr. Faraday has discovered\r\nthat this property is not peculiar to ice; that, with a few exceptions,\r\nbodies which do not conduct electricity when solid acquire that\r\nproperty, and are immediately decomposed, when they become fluid, and,\r\nin general, that decomposition takes place as soon as the solution\r\nacquires the capacity of conduction, which has led him to suspect that\r\nthe power of conduction may be only a consequence of decomposition.\r\n\r\nHeat increases the conducting power of some substances for Voltaic\r\nelectricity, and of the gases for both kinds. Dr. Faraday has given a\r\nnew proof of the connexion between heat and electricity, by showing\r\nthat, in general, when a solid, which is not a metal, becomes fluid, it\r\nalmost entirely loses its power of conducting heat, while it acquires a\r\ncapacity for conducting electricity in a high degree. M. Becquerel\r\nregards the production of heat and that of electricity to be\r\nconcomitant; their dependence being such, that when one is increased the\r\nother diminishes, and _vice versâ_, so that one may altogether disappear\r\nwith the increase of the other. For instance, when electricity\r\ncirculates in a metallic wire, the greater the heat produced, the less\r\nthe quantity of electricity which passes, and the contrary, so that the\r\naffair proceeds as if electricity were converted into heat, and heat\r\ninto electricity. Again, in a closed galvanic circuit the sum of the\r\nheat produced in the chemical action of the acidulated water upon the\r\nzinc and in the conducting wire is constant, so that the quantity of\r\nheat disengaged in the reaction is greater in proportion as less\r\nelectricity passes through the wire. These, and other circumstances,\r\nprove such an intimate connexion between the production of heat and\r\nelectricity, that in the change of condition of substances the\r\nelectrical effects might disappear or be annulled by the calorific\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nThe galvanic current affects all the senses: nothing can be more\r\ndisagreeable than the shock, which may even be fatal if the battery be\r\nvery powerful. A bright flash of light is perceived with the eyes shut,\r\nwhen one of the wires touches the face, and the other the hand. By\r\ntouching the ear with one wire, and holding the other, strange noises\r\nare heard; and an acid taste is perceived when the positive wire is\r\napplied to the tip of the tongue, and the negative wire touches some\r\nother part of it. By reversing the poles the taste becomes alkaline. It\r\nrenders the pale light of the glow-worm more intense. Dead animals are\r\nroused by it, as if they started again into life, and it may ultimately\r\nprove to be the cause of muscular action in the living.\r\n\r\nSeveral fish possess the faculty of producing electrical effects. The\r\nmost remarkable are the gymnotus electricus, found in South America; and\r\nthe torpedo, a genus of ray, frequent in the Mediterranean. The\r\nelectrical action of the torpedo depends upon an apparatus apparently\r\nanalogous to the Voltaic pile, which the animal has the power of\r\ncharging at will, consisting of membranous columns filled throughout\r\nwith laminæ, separated from one another by a fluid. The absolute\r\nquantity of electricity brought into circulation by the torpedo is so\r\ngreat, that it effects the decomposition of water, has power sufficient\r\nto make magnets, gives very severe shocks and the electric spark. It is\r\nidentical in kind with that of the galvanic battery, the electricity of\r\nthe under surface of the fish being the same with the negative pole, and\r\nthat in the upper surface the same with the positive pole. Its manner of\r\naction is, however, somewhat different; for, although the evolution of\r\nthe electricity is continued for a sensible time, it is interrupted,\r\nbeing communicated by a succession of discharges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION XXX.\r\n\r\nDiscovery of Electro-magnetism—Deflection of the Magnetic Needle by a\r\n  Current of Electricity—Direction of the Force—Rotatory Motion by\r\n  Electricity—Rotation of a Wire and a Magnet—Rotation of a Magnet about\r\n  its Axis—Of Mercury and Water—Electro-Magnetic Cylinder or\r\n  Helix—Suspension of a Needle in a Helix—Electro-Magnetic\r\n  Induction—Temporary Magnets—The Galvanometer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE disturbing effects of the aurora and lightning on the mariner’s\r\ncompass had been long known. In the year 1819 M. Oersted, Professor of\r\nNatural Philosophy at Copenhagen, discovered that a current of Voltaic\r\nelectricity exerts a powerful influence on a magnetized needle. This\r\nobservation has given rise to the theory of electro-magnetism—one of the\r\nmost interesting sciences of modern times, whether it be considered as\r\nleading us a step farther in generalization, by identifying two agencies\r\nhitherto referred to different causes, or as developing a new force,\r\nunparalleled in the system of the world, which, overcoming the\r\nretardation from friction, and the obstacle of a resisting medium,\r\nmaintains a perpetual motion as long as the action of a Voltaic battery\r\nis continued.\r\n\r\nWhen the two poles of a Voltaic battery are connected by a metallic\r\nwire, so as to complete a circuit, the electricity flows without\r\nceasing. If a straight portion of that wire be placed parallel to, and\r\nhorizontally above, a magnetized needle at rest in the magnetic\r\nmeridian, but freely poised like the mariner’s compass, the action of\r\nthe electric current flowing through the wire will instantly cause the\r\nneedle to change its position. Its extremity will deviate from the north\r\ntowards the east or west, according to the direction in which the\r\ncurrent is flowing; and, on reversing the direction of the current, the\r\nmotion of the needle will be reversed also. The numerous experiments\r\nthat have been made on magnetism and electricity, as well as those on\r\nthe various relative motions of a magnetic needle under the influence of\r\ngalvanic electricity, arising from all possible positions of the\r\nconducting wire, and every direction of the Voltaic current, together\r\nwith all the other phenomena of electro-magnetism, are explained by Dr.\r\nRoget in some excellent articles on these subjects in the Library of\r\nUseful Knowledge.\r\n\r\nAll experiments tend to prove that the force emanating from the electric\r\ncurrent, which produces such effects on the magnetic needle, acts at\r\nright angles to the current. The action of an electrical current upon\r\neither pole of a magnet has no tendency to cause the pole to approach or\r\nrecede, but to rotate about it. If the stream of electricity be supposed\r\nto pass through the centre of a circle whose plane is perpendicular to\r\nthe current, the direction of the force exerted by the electricity will\r\nalways be in the tangent to the circle, or at right angles to its radius\r\n(N. 223). Consequently, the tangential force of the electricity has a\r\ntendency to make the pole of a magnet move in a circle round the wire of\r\nthe battery.\r\n\r\nRotatory motion was suggested by Dr. Wollaston. Dr. Faraday was the\r\nfirst who actually succeeded in making the pole of a magnet rotate about\r\na vertical conducting wire. In order to limit the action of the\r\nelectricity to one pole, about two-thirds of a small magnet were\r\nimmersed in mercury, the lower end being fastened by a thread to the\r\nbottom of the vessel containing the mercury. When the magnet was thus\r\nfloating almost vertically with its north pole above the surface, a\r\ncurrent of positive electricity was made to descend perpendicularly\r\nthrough a wire touching the mercury, and immediately the magnet began to\r\nrotate from left to right about the wire. The force being uniform, the\r\nrotation was accelerated till the tangential force was balanced by the\r\nresistance of the mercury, when it became constant. Under the same\r\ncircumstances the south pole of the magnet rotates from right to left.\r\nIt is evident, from this experiment, that the wire may also be made to\r\nperform a rotation round the magnet, since the action of the current of\r\nelectricity on the pole of the magnet must necessarily be accompanied by\r\na corresponding reaction of the pole of the magnet on the electricity in\r\nthe wire. This experiment has been accomplished by a vast number of\r\ncontrivances, and even a small battery, consisting of two plates, has\r\nperformed the rotation. Dr. Faraday produced both motions at the same\r\ntime in a vessel containing mercury; the wire and the magnet revolved in\r\none direction about a common centre of motion, each following the other.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to make a magnet, and also a cylinder, revolve about\r\ntheir own axes, which they do with great rapidity. Mercury has been made\r\nto rotate by means of Voltaic electricity, and Professor Ritchie\r\nexhibited in the Royal Institution the singular spectacle of the\r\nrotation of water by the same means, while the vessel containing it\r\nremained stationary. The water was in a hollow double cylinder of glass,\r\nand, on being made the conductor of electricity, was observed to revolve\r\nin a regular vortex, changing its direction as the poles of the battery\r\nwere alternately reversed. Professor Ritchie found that all the\r\ndifferent conductors hitherto tried by him, such as water, charcoal,\r\n&c., give the same electro-magnetic results when transmitting the same\r\nquantity of electricity, and that they deflect the magnetic needle in an\r\nequal degree when their respective axes of conduction are at the same\r\ndistance from it. But one of the most extraordinary effects of this\r\nforce is exhibited by coiling a copper wire, so as to form a helix or\r\ncorkscrew, and connecting the extremities of the wire with the poles of\r\na galvanic battery. If a magnetized steel bar or needle be placed within\r\nthe screw, so as to rest upon the lower part, the instant a current of\r\nelectricity is sent through the wire of the helix, the steel bar starts\r\nup by the influence of this invisible power, and remains suspended in\r\nthe air in opposition to the force of gravitation (N. 224). The effect\r\nof the electro-magnetic power exerted by each turn of the wire is to\r\nurge the north pole of the magnet in one direction, and the south pole\r\nin the other. The force thus exerted is multiplied in degree and\r\nincreased in extent by each repetition of the turns of the wire, and in\r\nconsequence of these opposing forces the bar remains suspended. This\r\nhelix has all the properties of a magnet while the electrical current is\r\nflowing through it, and may be substituted for one in almost every\r\nexperiment. It acts as if it had a north pole at one extremity and a\r\nsouth pole at the other, and is attracted and repelled by the poles of a\r\nmagnet exactly as if it were one itself. All these results depend upon\r\nthe course of the electricity; that is, on the direction of the turns of\r\nthe screw, according as it is from right to left, or from left to right,\r\nbeing contrary in the two cases.\r\n\r\nThe action of Voltaic electricity on a magnet is not only precisely the\r\nsame with the action of two magnets on one another, but its influence in\r\nproducing temporary magnetism in iron and steel is also the same with\r\nmagnetic induction. The term induction, when applied to electric\r\ncurrents, expresses the power which these currents possess of inducing a\r\nparticular state upon matter in their immediate neighbourhood, otherwise\r\nneutral or indifferent. For example, the connecting wire of a galvanic\r\nbattery holds iron filings suspended like a magnet as long as the\r\ncurrent continues to flow through it: the iron becomes magnetic by the\r\ninduction of the current. The most powerful temporary magnets are\r\nobtained by bending a thick cylinder of soft iron into the form of a\r\nhorseshoe, and surrounding it with a coil of thick copper wire covered\r\nwith silk to prevent communication between its coils. When this wire\r\nforms part of a galvanic circuit the iron becomes so highly magnetic by\r\nthe induction of the current flowing through the wire that a temporary\r\nmagnet of this kind made by Professor Henry of the Albany Academy in the\r\nUnited States sustained a weight of nearly a ton. Another by Mr. Gage\r\nhas been applied with considerable success as a moving power: its spark\r\nis a bright flash, and the snap as loud as a pistol. But the most\r\npowerful known is that employed by Mr. Joule in his experiments, which\r\nsustains a weight of 2080 lbs. The iron loses its magnetism the instant\r\nthe electricity ceases to flow, and acquires it again as instantaneously\r\nwhen the circuit is renewed.\r\n\r\nThe action of an electric current causes a deviation of the compass from\r\nthe plane of the magnetic meridian. In proportion as the needle recedes\r\nfrom the meridian, the intensity of the force of terrestrial magnetism\r\nincreases, while at the same time the electro-magnetic force diminishes;\r\nthe number of degrees at which the needle stops, showing where the\r\nequilibrium between these two forces takes place, will indicate the\r\nintensity of the galvanic current. The galvanometer, constructed upon\r\nthis principle, is employed to measure the intensity of galvanic\r\ncurrents collected and conveyed to it by wires. This instrument is\r\nrendered much more sensible by neutralizing the effects of the earth’s\r\nmagnetism on the needle, which is accomplished by placing a second\r\nmagnetised needle so as to counteract the action of the earth on the\r\nfirst—a precaution requisite in all delicate magnetical experiments.\r\n\r\nIt has been ascertained by means of this instrument that the action of\r\nan electrical current upon a magnet is inversely as the square of the\r\ndistance, and the energy with which an electro magnet acts is directly\r\nas the power of the galvanic battery and the number of coils round the\r\ncore, and inversely as the resistance of the wire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION XXXI.\r\n\r\nElectro-Dynamics—Reciprocal Action of Electric Currents—Identity of\r\n  Electro-Dynamic Cylinders and Magnets—Differences between the Action\r\n  of Voltaic Electricity and Electricity of Tension—Effects of a Voltaic\r\n  Current—Ampère’s Theory—Dr. Faraday’s Experiment of Electrifying and\r\n  Magnetising a Ray of Light.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE science of electro-magnetism, which must render the name of M.\r\nOersted ever memorable, relates to the reciprocal action of electrical\r\nand magnetic currents: M. Ampère, by discovering the mutual action of\r\nelectrical currents on one another, has added a new branch to the\r\nsubject, to which he has given the name of electro-dynamics.\r\n\r\nWhen electric currents are passing through two conducting wires, so\r\nsuspended or supported as to be capable of moving both towards and from\r\none another, they show mutual attraction or repulsion, according as the\r\ncurrents are flowing in the same or in contrary directions; the\r\nphenomena varying with the relative inclinations and positions of the\r\nstreams of electricity. The mutual action of such currents, whether they\r\nflow in the same or in contrary directions, whether they be parallel,\r\nperpendicular, diverging, converging, circular, or heliacal, all produce\r\ndifferent kinds of motion in a conducting wire, both rectilineal and\r\ncircular, and also the rotation of a wire helix, such as that described,\r\nnow called an electro-dynamic cylinder on account of some improvements\r\nin its construction (N. 225). And, as the hypothesis of a force varying\r\ninversely as the square of the distance accords perfectly with all the\r\nobserved phenomena, these motions come under the same laws of dynamics\r\nand analysis as any other branch of physics.\r\n\r\nElectro-dynamic cylinders act on each other precisely as if they were\r\nmagnets during the time the electricity is flowing through them. All the\r\nexperiments that can be performed with the cylinder might be\r\naccomplished with a magnet. That end of the cylinder in which the\r\ncurrent of positive electricity is moving in a direction similar to the\r\nmotion of the hands of a watch, acts as the south pole of a magnet, and\r\nthe other end, in which the current is flowing in a contrary direction,\r\nexhibits northern polarity.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena mark a very decided difference between the action of\r\nelectricity in motion or at rest, that is, between Voltaic and static\r\nelectricity; the laws they follow are in many respects of an entirely\r\ndifferent nature, though the electricities themselves are identical.\r\nSince Voltaic electricity flows perpetually, it cannot be accumulated,\r\nand consequently has no tension, or tendency to escape from the wires\r\nwhich conduct it. Nor do these wires either attract or repel light\r\nbodies in their vicinity, whereas static or ordinary electricity can be\r\naccumulated in insulated bodies to a great degree, and in that state of\r\nrest the tendency to escape is proportional to the quantity accumulated\r\nand the resistance it meets with. In ordinary electricity, the law of\r\naction is, that dissimilar electricities attract and similar\r\nelectricities repel one another. In Voltaic electricity, on the\r\ncontrary, similar currents, or such as are moving in the same direction,\r\nattract one another, while a mutual repulsion is exerted between\r\ndissimilar currents, or such as flow in opposite directions. Common\r\nelectricity escapes when the pressure of the atmosphere is removed, but\r\nthe electro-dynamical effects are the same whether the conductors be in\r\nair or in vacuo.\r\n\r\nThe effects produced by a current of electricity depend upon the\r\ncelerity of its motion through a conducting wire. Yet we are ignorant\r\nwhether the motion be uniform or varied, but the method of transmission\r\nhas a marked influence on the results; for, when it flows without\r\nintermission, it occasions a deviation in the magnetic needle, but it\r\nhas no effect whatever when its motion is discontinuous or interrupted,\r\nlike the current produced by the common electrical machine when a\r\ncommunication is made between the positive and negative conductors.\r\n\r\nM. Ampère has established a theory of electro-magnetism suggested by the\r\nanalogy between electro-dynamic cylinders and magnets, founded upon the\r\nreciprocal attraction of electro-currents, to which he reduces all the\r\nphenomena of magnetism and electro-magnetism, by assuming that the\r\nmagnetic properties which bodies possess derive these properties from\r\ncurrents of electricity, circulating about every part in one uniform\r\ndirection. Although every particle of a magnet possesses like properties\r\nwith the whole, yet the general effect is the same as if the magnetic\r\nproperties were confined to the surface. Consequently, Ampère concludes\r\nthat the internal electro-currents must compensate one another, and that\r\nthe magnetism of a body must therefore arise from a superficial current\r\nof electricity constantly circulating in a direction perpendicular to\r\nthe axis of the magnet; so that the reciprocal action of magnets and all\r\nthe phenomena of electro-magnetism are reduced to the action and\r\nreaction of superficial currents of electricity, acting at right angles\r\nto their direction.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the experiments made by Ampère to elucidate the subject,\r\nthere is still an uncertainty in the theory of the induction of\r\nmagnetism by an electric current in a body near it. It does not appear\r\nwhether electric currents which did not previously exist are actually\r\nproduced by induction, or if its effect be only to give one uniform\r\ndirection to the infinite number of electric currents previously\r\nexisting in the particles of the body, and thus rendering them capable\r\nof exhibiting magnetic phenomena, in the same manner as polarization\r\nreduces the undulations of light to one plane, which had previously been\r\nperformed in every plane. Possibly both may be combined in producing the\r\neffect; for the action of the electric current may not only give a\r\ncommon direction to those already existing, but may also increase their\r\nintensity. However that may be, by assuming that the attractions and\r\nrepulsions of the elementary portions of electric currents vary\r\ninversely as the square of the distance, the actions being at right\r\nangles to the direction of the current, it is found that the attraction\r\nand repulsion of a current of indefinite length on the elementary\r\nportion of a parallel current at any distance from it are in the simple\r\nratio of the shortest distance between them: consequently, the\r\nreciprocal action of electric currents is reduced to the composition and\r\nresolution of forces, so that the phenomena of electro-magnetism are\r\nbrought under the laws of mechanics by the theory of Ampère. It appears\r\nthat Dr. Faraday’s very remarkable experiment of electrifying and\r\nmagnetising a ray of polarized light may possibly afford a demonstration\r\nof the reality of Ampère’s explanation of the ultimate nature of\r\nmagnetism.\r\n\r\nIn this experiment a copper wire 501 feet long was arranged in four\r\nconcentric spirals, the extremities of which were connected with the\r\npoles of a powerful galvanic battery, and a polished prism of heavy\r\nglass, or silicated borate of lead, was placed in the axis of the spiral\r\nas a core, through the length or axis of which a ray of polarized light\r\nwas sent. This ray, viewed through a piece of tourmaline or a Nichol’s\r\neye-piece, vanished and reappeared as usual at each quarter revolution\r\nof the eye-piece; but when a current of electricity was sent through the\r\nspiral at the time the ray had vanished, it instantly reappeared, and\r\nremained as long as the electric current continued to flow; but the\r\ninstant the electricity ceased the light vanished, and as often as the\r\nelectric current flowed through the spiral, or was interrupted, so often\r\ndid the polarized ray appear and vanish.\r\n\r\nThe character of the force thus impressed on the heavy glass is that of\r\nrotation, for the stopping and renewing of the electric current had the\r\nsame effect as the revolving motion of the eye-piece in making the light\r\nalternately appear and vanish. Accordingly, Dr. Faraday found that, when\r\nthe electricity flowed through the spiral in one direction, the rotation\r\nof the plane of polarization was right-handed; and when it flowed in the\r\nother direction, the rotation of the plane of polarization was\r\nleft-handed, the rotation increasing with the length of the prism and\r\nthe intensity of the electricity. The same phenomena were produced by a\r\nvery powerful magnet when a ray of polarized light was sent through the\r\nheavy glass parallel to the line of magnetic force.\r\n\r\nHeavy glass or silico-borate of lead has the property more than any\r\nother substance of making light rotate under electric and magnetic\r\ninfluence; but many substances have the property more or less, as flint\r\nand crown glass, rock salt, all the fixed and essential oils, water, and\r\nmany other liquids, but none of the gases possess it. In those\r\nsubstances that have the power of circular polarization naturally, the\r\nmagnetic and electric influences increase or diminish the rotation\r\naccording to its direction.\r\n\r\nPolarized heat is made to revolve in the same manner, when the medium\r\nthrough which it passes is subject to magnetic influence.\r\n\r\nMr. Grove observes that if light and heat be merely modes of force,\r\nwhich there is every reason to believe that they are, it may be fairly\r\nstated that in these experiments magnetism affects these forces\r\ndirectly; for light and heat being, in that view, motions of ordinary\r\nmatter, magnetism in affecting these movements affects the forces which\r\noccasion them. If, however, this effect of magnetism be a molecular\r\nchange of the matter transmitting the light and heat, then it follows\r\nthat the light and heat are indirectly affected by the electricity or\r\nmagnetism. Dr. Faraday says that the magnetic forces do not act on the\r\nray of light directly, without the intervention of matter, but through\r\nthe mediation of the substance in which they and the ray have a\r\nsimultaneous existence; the substances and the forces giving to and\r\nreceiving from each other the power of acting on the light. Dr. Thomson\r\nhas shown, by a mathematical investigation of the subject, that Dr.\r\nFaraday’s discovery seems to prove the truth of Ampère’s explanation of\r\nthe ultimate nature of magnetism. However, in Ampère’s theory, the\r\ncurrent of electricity flowing round the iron makes it a permanent\r\nmagnet, but it does not make the heavy glass or the other bodies, which\r\nhave the same property, either temporary magnets when the light is\r\nrotating within them, or permanent magnets when the inductive action of\r\nthe current of electricity ceases. Hence the molecular condition of the\r\nsubstances, when the light is rotating in them, must be specifically\r\ndistinct from that of magnetised iron: it must therefore be a new\r\nmagnetic condition, and the force which the matter in this state\r\npossesses must be a new magnetic force.\r\n\r\nAfter describing his admirable experiment, Dr. Faraday observes that “it\r\nhas established for the first time a true, direct relation and\r\ndependence between light and the magnetic and electric forces; and thus\r\na great addition is made to the facts and considerations which tend to\r\nprove that all natural forces are tied together, and have one common\r\norigin. It is no doubt difficult, in the present state of our knowledge,\r\nto express our expectations in exact terms; and though I have said that\r\nanother of the powers of nature is in these experiments directly related\r\nto the rest, I ought perhaps rather to say that another form of the\r\ngreat power is distinctly and directly related to the other forms; or\r\nthat the great power manifested by particular phenomena in particular\r\nforms is here further identified and recognised by the direct relation\r\nof its form of light to its forms of electricity and magnetism. The\r\nrelation existing between _polarized_ light and magnetism and\r\nelectricity is even more interesting than if it had been shown to exist\r\nwith common light only. It cannot but extend to common light; and, as it\r\nbelongs to light made in a certain respect more precise in its character\r\nand properties by polarization, it collates and connects it with these\r\npowers in that duality of character which they possess, and yields an\r\nopening, which before was wanting to us, for the appliances of these to\r\nthe investigation of the nature of this and other radiant agencies.”\r\nThus Dr. Faraday’s experiment not only shows the increasing connexion\r\nbetween the sciences, but the tendency of all the forces of nature to\r\nmerge in one great and universal power.\r\n\r\nIn the action of a magnet upon the stratifications of an electrical\r\ndischarge Mr. Gassiot has discovered a new instance of the connexion\r\nbetween magnetism and light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION XXXII.\r\n\r\nMagneto-Electricity—Volta-Electric Induction—Magneto-Electric\r\n  Induction—Identity in the Action of Electricity and\r\n  Magnetism—Description of a Magneto-Electric Apparatus and its\r\n  Effects—Identity of Magnetism and Electricity—The Submarine Telegraph.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM the law of action and reaction being equal and contrary, it might\r\nbe expected that, as electricity powerfully affects magnets, so,\r\nconversely, magnetism ought to produce electrical phenomena. By proving\r\nthis very important fact from the following series of interesting and\r\ningenious experiments, Dr. Faraday has added another branch to the\r\nscience which he has named magneto-electricity. A great quantity of\r\ncopper wire was coiled in the form of a helix round one half of a ring\r\nof soft iron, and connected with a galvanic battery; while a similar\r\nhelix connected with a galvanometer was wound round the other half of\r\nthe ring, but not touching the first helix. As soon as contact was made\r\nwith the battery, the needle of the galvanometer was deflected. But the\r\naction was transitory; for, when the contact was continued, the needle\r\nreturned to its usual position, and was not affected by the continual\r\nflow of the electricity through the wire connected with the battery. As\r\nsoon, however, as the contact was broken, the needle of the galvanometer\r\nwas again deflected, but in the contrary direction. Similar effects were\r\nproduced by an apparatus consisting of two helices of copper wire coiled\r\nround a block of wood, instead of iron, from which Dr. Faraday infers\r\nthat the electric current passing from the battery through one wire\r\ninduces a similar current through the other wire, but only at the\r\ninstant of contact, and that a momentary current is induced in a\r\ncontrary direction when the passage of the electricity is suddenly\r\ninterrupted. These brief currents or waves of electricity were found to\r\nbe capable of magnetizing needles, of passing through a small extent of\r\nfluid, and, when charcoal points were interposed in the current of the\r\ninduced helix, a minute spark was perceived as often as the contacts\r\nwere made or broken, but neither chemical action nor any other electric\r\neffects were obtained. A deviation of the needle of the galvanometer\r\ntook place when common magnets were employed instead of the Voltaic\r\ncurrent; so that the magnetic and electric forces are identical in their\r\neffects in this experiment. Again, when a helix formed of 220 feet of\r\ncopper wire, into which a cylinder of soft iron was introduced, was\r\nplaced between the north and south poles of two bar magnets, and\r\nconnected with the galvanometer by means of wires from each extremity,\r\nas often as the magnets were brought into contact with the iron cylinder\r\nit became magnetic by induction, and produced a deflection in the needle\r\nof the galvanometer. On continuing the contact the needle resumed its\r\nnatural position, and, when the contact was broken, deflection took\r\nplace in the opposite direction; when the magnetic contacts were\r\nreversed, the deflection was reversed also. With strong magnets, so\r\npowerful was the action, that the needle of the galvanometer whirled\r\nround several times successively; and similar effects were produced by\r\nthe mere approximation or removal of the helix to the poles of the\r\nmagnets. Thus it was proved that magnets produce the very same effects\r\non the galvanometer that electricity does. Though at that time no\r\nchemical decomposition was effected by these momentary currents which\r\nemanate from the magnets, they agitated the limbs of a frog; and Dr.\r\nFaraday justly observes, that “an agent which is conducted along\r\nmetallic wires in the manner described, which, whilst so passing,\r\npossesses the peculiar magnetic actions and force of a current of\r\nelectricity, which can agitate and convulse the limbs of a frog, and\r\nwhich finally can produce a spark by its discharge through charcoal, can\r\nonly be electricity.” Soon after he completely established the identity\r\nof the two powers by producing the spark, heating metallic wires, and\r\naccomplishing chemical decomposition. Hence it appears that electrical\r\ncurrents are evolved by magnets, which produce the same phenomena with\r\nthe electrical currents from the Voltaic battery: they, however, differ\r\nmaterially in this respect—that time is required for the exercise of the\r\nmagnetico-electric induction, whereas Volta-electric induction is\r\ninstantaneous.\r\n\r\nThus the effect of induction or the influence of the spiral wire in\r\nincreasing the electric and magnetic power is very great indeed, and to\r\nthat we are indebted for the electric telegraph, for Voltaic electricity\r\nalone is too feeble to overcome the resistance of a long wire.\r\n\r\nElectric currents, whatever their tension may be, produce the phenomena\r\nof induction; these again induce other currents in bodies capable of\r\ninduction, and so on indefinitely; the first and second flow in the same\r\ndirection, the others alternately opposite and direct. They all give the\r\nshock and can decompose water, but with Volta-electric currents the\r\nelevation of temperature as well as their physiological and magnetic\r\neffects are produced by instantaneous actions, which only depend upon\r\nthe quantity and tension of the current, and by no means on its\r\nduration, for induced currents only exist for a moment when the circuit\r\nof the battery is broken. The most energetic physiological effects are\r\nproduced by a small quantity of electricity moving with great velocity.\r\nThe apparatus first employed by Dr. Faraday is in effect a battery,\r\nwhere the agent is the magnetic instead of the Voltaic force, or, in\r\nother words, electricity, and is thus constructed:—\r\n\r\nA very powerful horseshoe magnet, formed of twelve steel plates in close\r\napproximation, is placed in a horizontal position. An armature,\r\nconsisting of a bar of the purest soft iron, has each of its ends bent\r\nat right angles, so that the faces of those ends may be brought directly\r\nopposite and close to the poles of the magnet when required. Ten copper\r\nwires—covered with silk, in order to insulate them—are wound round one\r\nhalf of the bar of soft iron, as a compound helix: ten other wires, also\r\ninsulated, are wound round the other half of the bar. The extremities of\r\nthe first set of wires are in metallic connexion with a circular disc,\r\nwhich dips into a cup of mercury, while the ends of the other ten wires\r\nin the opposite direction are soldered to a projecting screw-piece,\r\nwhich carries a slip of copper with two opposite points. The steel\r\nmagnet is stationary; but when the armature, together with its\r\nappendages, is made to rotate vertically, the edge of the disc always\r\nremains immersed in the mercury, while the points of the copper slip\r\nalternately dip in it and rise above it. By the ordinary laws of\r\ninduction, the armature becomes a temporary magnet while its bent ends\r\nare opposite the poles of the steel magnet, and ceases to be magnetic\r\nwhen they are at right angles to them. It imparts its temporary\r\nmagnetism to the helices which concentrate it; and, while one set\r\nconveys a current to the disc, the other set conducts the opposite\r\ncurrent to the copper slip. As the edge of the revolving disc is always\r\nimmersed in the mercury, one set of wires is constantly maintained in\r\ncontact with it, and the circuit is only completed when a point of the\r\ncopper slip dips in the mercury also; but the circuit is broken the\r\nmoment that point rises above it. Thus, by the rotation of the armature,\r\nthe circuit is alternately broken and renewed; and as it is only at\r\nthese moments that electric action is manifested, a brilliant spark\r\ntakes place every time the copper point leaves the surface of the\r\nmercury. Platinum wire is ignited, shocks smart enough to be\r\ndisagreeable are given, and water is decomposed with astonishing\r\nrapidity, by the same means; which proves, beyond a doubt, the identity\r\nof the magnetic and electric agencies, and places Dr. Faraday, whose\r\nexperiments established the principle, in the first rank of experimental\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\nA magneto-electric machine has been recently constructed by Mr. Henley,\r\nof enormous power. It consists of two permanent magnets, from which the\r\ninduction is obtained; each of these is formed of thirty horseshoe steel\r\nmagnets, two feet and a half long, and from four to five inches broad,\r\nand each is surrounded by a coil of wire six miles long, coated with\r\nsilk to insulate the coils. A shock from these wires would be\r\ninstantaneous death. This apparatus will ultimately be employed to send\r\na stream of electricity through long submarine and subterraneous wires;\r\nbut a Volta-electric machine has hitherto been used, in which the\r\nelectricity is generated by a galvanic battery instead of magnets.\r\n\r\nInduction, or the effect of the spiral wires in augmenting the power of\r\nVoltaic electricity, is admirably illustrated in the Atlantic telegraph.\r\n\r\nWires that are to convey electricity under ground, or through water,\r\nmust be defended from injury and insulated to prevent the lateral escape\r\nof the electricity. For that purpose the cable that is laid at the\r\nbottom of the Atlantic, from near Valentia in Ireland to Trinity Bay in\r\nNewfoundland, is formed of seven fine copper wires which convey the\r\nelectricity, bound together by a coating of gutta percha, over which\r\nthere are layers of cloth dipped in pitch, and then the whole is covered\r\nby steel wires twisted together in strands and twined round in long\r\nclose spirals, forming a cord or cable not more than an inch and a\r\nquarter in diameter, and 2100 miles long. The use of the gutta percha is\r\nto insulate the wires; the other coatings are merely for protection.\r\n\r\nThe Voltaic battery which generates the electricity consists of 40\r\ncells, the plates of which are alternately of zinc and platinized\r\nsilver, each about nine inches square, the exciting fluid being dilute\r\nsulphuric acid. Although the force developed by this battery is so great\r\nthat a piece of iron three inches long and three eighths of an inch in\r\ndiameter placed in contact with the poles may be consumed in a few\r\nminutes, it is absolutely incapable of sending a current of electricity\r\nthrough wires 2500 miles long, on account of their resistance, without\r\nthe aid of Dr. Faraday’s inductive action. It is only the primary agent\r\nfor inducing a current of sufficient strength.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish that, many thousand yards of fine copper wire coated with\r\nsilk are wound round a hollow soft iron cylinder; the whole is then\r\ncoated by gutta percha, and the end of the wire is joined to the wires\r\nin the cable so as to form a continuous line from Valentia to\r\nNewfoundland. A second copper wire, shorter but thicker than the\r\npreceding, and also insulated by a coating of silk, is wound round the\r\ncylinder above the gutta percha: when the ends of this thick wire are\r\nbrought into contact with the poles of the battery, currents of\r\nelectricity flow through it, between pole and pole, and in their passage\r\ntemporarily convert the hollow iron cylinder into a powerful\r\nelectro-magnet, which by its reaction induces a current of electricity\r\nin the fine wire of sufficient power to cross the Atlantic. The\r\nefficiency of the electric telegraph depends upon the power we possess\r\nof breaking and renewing the current at pleasure, since by that means\r\ndistinct and successive signals are made from station to station. In the\r\nAtlantic cable positive and negative electricity are transmitted\r\nalternately; the electricity is sent to America from alternate poles,\r\nand the current returns again through the water, which completes the\r\ncircuit.\r\n\r\nThe passage of electricity through a cable or telegraphic wire in air is\r\nsensibly instantaneous; that through a cable, whether extended in water\r\nor under ground, requires time on account of lateral induction through\r\nthe gutta percha; for the electricity, in passing through the wires,\r\ninduces the opposite electricity on the surface of the water or moist\r\nearth in contact with the cable, and in that respect it is precisely\r\nlike a Leyden jar, the gutta percha representing the glass. As the power\r\nof induction is proportional to the tension of the electricity, and as\r\nthe tension is continually diminished by the resistance of the wires,\r\nthe induction is continually diminished and requires a longer time.\r\nElectricity took two seconds to pass through a cable 768 miles long,\r\nlaid under ground from London to Manchester, and back again twice; while\r\nin air it was all but instantaneous, because the inductive capacity of\r\nair is very much less than that of water or moist earth. In the\r\nexperiment with the cable under ground it took two-thirds of a second to\r\novercome the resistance of the wires, and then the velocity of the\r\nelectricity was 1000 miles in a second, and it was the same whatever the\r\nintensity of the electricity.\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that the efficiency of the electric\r\ntelegraph depends upon the breaking and renewing the current of\r\nelectricity by means of which a succession of waves of electricity are\r\nsent through the conducting wires. Now it has been ascertained that\r\nthree electric waves may travel simultaneously through the wires of the\r\nAtlantic telegraph with sufficient intervals between them to record the\r\nindications they are intended to convey; that is, three signals can be\r\nintelligibly and practically transmitted in two seconds.\r\n\r\nThe original design, structure, and difficulty of depositing the cable\r\nare only equalled by the talent and perseverance with which it has been\r\ndone. The 5th of August, 1858, will be memorable for the accomplishment\r\nof the boldest enterprise that ever was undertaken by man, and which is\r\nonly the beginning of a vast submarine communication that will\r\nultimately encircle the globe. It has been granted to British genius\r\nthus to annihilate time and space, in order to connect all mankind into\r\none great family for their moral and religious advancement; and,\r\nwhatever may be the fate of the British Islands in the course of ages,\r\nto their energetic race the glory will remain of having been the chief\r\ninstruments in the hands of Providence for the civilization of the\r\nworld—a civilization which will extend with the development of their\r\nnumerous colonies into great independent Christian states, like those of\r\nthe Union in North America. The thunderbolt snatched from heaven by\r\nFranklin now passes through the depths of the Atlantic as a messenger of\r\npeace between the kindred nations.[16]\r\n\r\nIn telegraphs on land the intensity of the battery or magnets is\r\nincreased by induction on the same principle. It is by intensity that\r\nthe electric current is enabled to pass through the wires, and that is\r\naugmented by increasing the number of coils round the cylinder: however,\r\nit is only advantageous when the distance between the stations is great,\r\nfor then the resistance in the additional coils bears a small proportion\r\nto the resistance offered by very long wires, but a very great\r\nproportion to that opposed in very short ones. The nice adjustment for\r\neach case has been determined by the experiments of eminent\r\nelectricians, and all the arrangements have been brought to great\r\nperfection in this wonderful triumph of science, which is due to Volta,\r\nwho called into existence the fiery stream, and to Faraday, who has\r\ngiven it the energy of the lightning.\r\n\r\nWhen the length of the wire in the helices of an electro-magnet is very\r\ngreat, it offers increasing resistance to the passage of the\r\nelectricity, so that the cessation of magnetism is not instantaneous\r\nwhen the contact with the Voltaic battery is broken. To remedy that\r\ndefect an instrument has been invented which instantaneously deprives\r\nthe apparatus of the remaining electricity. A great length of fine wire\r\ngives the severest shocks, while a shorter and thicker wire gives the\r\nlongest sparks and ignites the greatest quantity of platinum wire.\r\n\r\nRuhmkorff’s electro-inductive apparatus has either been improved, or new\r\nmachines constructed, by Messrs. Grove, Gassiot, and Joule, of intense\r\nenergy. Indeed, so great is the energy of electro-induction, that hopes\r\nwere entertained of its superseding steam as a motive power. For the\r\ncurrent of electricity from an electro-magnet can be made to flow in\r\nopposite directions, so as to produce alternate attractions and\r\nrepulsions, and consequently a continued motion, which might be applied\r\nas a motive force to machinery. However, Mr. Joule has proved that the\r\npower developed by one pound of coal in combustion is to that produced\r\nby one pound of zinc consumed in Mr. Grove’s powerful electro-magnetic\r\napparatus as nine to one, so that, even if zinc were as cheap as coal,\r\nand a Voltaic battery as easily kept in order as an engine-furnace,\r\nelectricity will not supersede steam as a motive power.\r\n\r\nA current of electricity traversing a conductor gives out a quantity of\r\nheat determined by fixed laws, the amount of which is invariable as long\r\nas the machine to which it is applied remains at rest; but the instant\r\nthe machine is set in motion a reaction takes place in the intensity of\r\nthe current, causing a diminution in the quantity of heat, because the\r\nheat that disappears is converted into the mechanical force exerted by\r\nthe engine.\r\n\r\nMr. Joule’s experiments prove that, whenever a current of electricity is\r\ngenerated by a magneto-electric machine, the quantity of heat evolved by\r\nthat current has a constant relation to the power required to work the\r\nmachine; and on the other hand, whenever an engine is worked by a\r\nVoltaic battery, that the power developed is at the expense of the\r\ncalorific force of the battery for a given consumption of zinc, the\r\nmechanical effect produced having a fixed relation to the heat lost in\r\nthe Voltaic current. The obvious conclusion Mr. Joule draws from these\r\nexperiments is, that heat and mechanical power are convertible into one\r\nanother, and it becomes evident, therefore, that heat is either the vis\r\nviva or living force of ponderable particles, or a state of attraction\r\nand repulsion capable of generating vis viva (N. 222).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SECTION XXXIII.\r\n\r\nElectricity produced by Rotation—Direction of the Currents—Electricity\r\n  from the Rotation of a Magnet—M. Arago’s Experiment explained—Rotation\r\n  of a Plate of Iron between the Poles of a Magnet—Relation of\r\n  Substances to Magnets of three Kinds—Thermo-Electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. ARAGO discovered a source of magnetism in rotatory motion. If a\r\ncircular plate of copper be made to revolve immediately above or below a\r\nmagnetic needle or magnet, suspended in such a manner that it may rotate\r\nin a plane parallel to that of the copper plate, the magnet tends to\r\nfollow the circumvolution of the plate; or, if the magnet revolves, the\r\nplate tends to follow its motion; so powerful is the effect, that\r\nmagnets and plates of many pounds weight have been carried round. This\r\nis quite independent of the motion of the air, since it is the same when\r\na pane of glass is interposed between the magnet and the copper. When\r\nthe magnet and the plate are at rest, not the smallest effect,\r\nattractive, repulsive, or of any kind, can be perceived between them. In\r\ndescribing this phenomenon, M. Arago states that it takes place not only\r\nwith metals, but with all substances, solids, liquids, and even gases,\r\nalthough the intensity depends upon the kind of substance in motion.\r\nExperiments made by Dr. Faraday explain this singular action. He found\r\nthat, if a piece of metal or a metallic wire forming a circuit of any\r\nform be moved from right to left across the lines of force proceeding\r\nfrom the pole of a bar magnet, these lines of force induce a current of\r\nelectricity flowing in one direction; and when the motion of the metal\r\nor wire is reversed, the direction of the current is reversed also: the\r\nrotation of the magnet about its axis has no effect on these results,\r\nand no current is induced when the metal or wire is at rest. A plate of\r\ncopper, twelve inches in diameter and one fifth of an inch thick, was\r\nplaced between the poles of a powerful horseshoe magnet, consequently\r\ncrossing the magnetic lines of force at right angles, and connected at\r\ncertain points with a galvanometer by copper wires. When the plate was\r\nat rest no effect was produced; but as soon as the plate was made to\r\nrevolve rapidly the galvanometer needle was deflected sometimes as much\r\nas 90°, and by a uniform rotation the deflection was constantly\r\nmaintained at 45°. When the motion of the copper plate was reversed, the\r\nneedle was deflected in the contrary direction, and thus a permanent\r\ncurrent of electricity was evolved by an ordinary magnet. The intensity\r\nof the electricity collected by the wires, and conveyed by them to the\r\ngalvanometer, varied with the position of the plate relatively to the\r\npoles of the magnet.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the electricity in the copper plate may be conceived by\r\nconsidering that, merely by moving a single wire, like the spoke of a\r\nwheel, before a magnetic pole, a current of electricity tends to flow\r\nthrough it from one end to the other. Hence, if a wheel be constructed\r\nof a great many such spokes, and revolved near the pole of a magnet in\r\nthe manner of the copper disc, each radius or spoke will tend to have a\r\ncurrent produced in it as it passes the pole. Now, as the circular plate\r\nis nothing more than an infinite number of radii or spokes in contact,\r\nthe currents will flow in the direction of the radii if a channel be\r\nopen for their return; and, in a continuous plate, that channel is\r\nafforded by the lateral portions on each side of the particular radius\r\nclose to the magnetic pole. This hypothesis is confirmed by observation;\r\nfor the currents of positive electricity set from the centre to the\r\ncircumference, and the negative from the circumference to the centre,\r\nand _vice versâ_, according to the position of the magnetic poles and\r\nthe direction of rotation; so that a collecting wire at the centre of\r\nthe copper plate conveys positive electricity to the galvanometer in one\r\ncase, and negative in another; that collected by a conducting wire in\r\ncontact with the circumference of the plate is always the opposite of\r\nthe electricity conveyed from the centre. It is evident that, when the\r\nplate and magnet are both at rest, no effect takes place, since the\r\nelectric currents which cause the deflection of the galvanometer are\r\nonly induced by motion across the magnetic lines of force. When the\r\nplate is placed edgewise so as to be parallel to these lines of force,\r\nno revolution of it with the most powerful magnet produces the slightest\r\nsigns of a current at the galvanometer. The same phenomena may be\r\nproduced by electro-magnets. The effects are similar when the magnet\r\nrotates and the plate remains at rest. When the magnet revolves\r\nuniformly about its own axis, electricity of the same kind is collected\r\nat its poles, and the opposite electricity at its equator.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena which take place in M. Arago’s experiments may be\r\nexplained on this principle. When both the copper plate and the magnet\r\nare revolving, the action of the induced electric current tends\r\ncontinually to diminish their relative motion, and to bring the moving\r\nbodies into a state of relative rest; so that, if one be made to revolve\r\nby an extraneous force, the other will tend to revolve about it in the\r\nsame direction, and with the same velocity.\r\n\r\nWhen a plate of iron, or of any substance capable of being made either a\r\ntemporary or permanent magnet, revolves between the poles of a magnet,\r\nit is found that dissimilar poles on opposite sides of the plate\r\nneutralize each other’s effects, so that no electricity is evolved;\r\nwhile similar poles on each side of the revolving plate increase the\r\nquantity of electricity, and a single pole end-on is sufficient. But\r\nwhen copper, and substances not sensible to ordinary magnetic\r\nimpressions, revolve, similar poles on opposite sides of the plate\r\nneutralize each other; dissimilar poles on each side exalt the action;\r\nand a single pole at the edge of the revolving plate, or end-on, does\r\nnothing. This forms a test for distinguishing the ordinary magnetic\r\nforce from that produced by rotation. If unlike poles, that is, a north\r\nand south pole, produce more effect than one pole, the force will be due\r\nto electric currents; if similar poles produce more effect than one,\r\nthen the power is not electric. These investigations show that there are\r\nreally very few bodies magnetic in the manner of iron. Dr. Faraday\r\ntherefore arranges substances in three classes, with regard to their\r\nrelation to magnets:—those affected by the magnet when at rest, like\r\niron, steel, and nickel, which possess ordinary magnetic properties;\r\nthose affected when in motion, in which electric currents are evolved by\r\nthe inductive force of the magnet, such as copper; and, lastly, those\r\nwhich are perfectly indifferent to the magnet, whether at rest or in\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nIt has already been observed that three bodies are requisite to form a\r\ngalvanic circuit, one of which must be fluid. But, in 1822, Professor\r\nSeebeck, of Berlin, discovered that electric currents may be produced by\r\nthe partial application of heat to a circuit formed of two solid\r\nconductors. For example, when a semicircle of bismuth, joined to a\r\nsemicircle of antimony, so as to form a ring, is heated at one of the\r\njunctions by a lamp, a current of electricity flows through the circuit\r\nfrom the antimony to the bismuth; and such thermo-electric currents\r\nproduce all the electro-magnetic effects. A compass needle, placed\r\neither within or without the circuit, and at a small distance from it,\r\nis deflected from its natural position, in a direction corresponding to\r\nthe way in which the electricity is flowing. If such a ring be suspended\r\nso as to move easily in any direction, it will obey the action of a\r\nmagnet brought near it, and may even be made to revolve. According to\r\nthe researches of M. Seebeck, the same substance, unequally heated,\r\nexhibits electrical currents; and M. Nobili observed, that in all\r\nmetals, except zinc, iron, and antimony, the electricity flows from the\r\nhot part towards that which is cold. That philosopher attributes\r\nterrestrial magnetism to a difference in the action of heat on the\r\nvarious substances of which the crust of the earth is composed; and, in\r\nconfirmation of his views, he has produced electrical currents by the\r\ncontact of two pieces of moist clay, of which one was hotter than the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nM. Becquerel constructed a thermo-electric battery of one kind of metal,\r\nby which he has determined the relation between the heat employed and\r\nthe intensity of the resulting electricity. He found that, in most\r\nmetals, the intensity of the current increases with the heat to a\r\ncertain limit, but that this law extends much farther in metals that are\r\ndifficult to fuse, and which do not rust. The experiments of Professor\r\nCumming show that the mutual action of a magnet and a thermo-electric\r\ncurrent is subject to the same laws as those of magnets and galvanic\r\ncurrents; consequently all the phenomena of repulsion, attraction, and\r\nrotation may be exhibited by a thermo-electric current. M. Botto, of\r\nTurin, has decomposed water and some solutions by thermo-electricity;\r\nand the Cav. Antinori of Florence succeeded in obtaining a brilliant\r\nspark with the aid of an electro-dynamic coil.\r\n\r\nThe principle of thermo-electricity has been employed by MM. Nobili and\r\nMelloni for measuring extremely minute quantities of heat in their\r\nexperiments on the instantaneous transmission of radiant heat. The\r\nthermo-multiplier, which they constructed for that purpose, consists of\r\na series of alternate bars, or rather fine wires of bismuth and\r\nantimony, placed side by side, and the extremities alternately soldered\r\ntogether. When heat is applied to one end of this apparatus, the other\r\nremaining at its natural temperature, currents of electricity flow\r\nthrough each pair of bars, which are conveyed by wires to a delicate\r\ngalvanometer, the needle of which points out the intensity of the\r\nelectricity conveyed, and consequently that of the heat employed. This\r\ninstrument is so delicate that the comparative warmth of different\r\ninsects has been ascertained by means of it.\r\n\r\nThe conservation of force is strictly maintained throughout the whole\r\nscience and different forms of electricity. In static electricity the\r\npositive and negative forces exactly balance one another; they are\r\nalways simultaneous, and related often by curved lines of force; there\r\nis no defect or surplus, and the existence of one kind without the other\r\nis utterly impossible—it is absolutely a dual force. The very same may\r\nbe said of electric currents, whether produced by the Voltaic battery or\r\nin any other way—the current in one part of the circuit is absolutely\r\nthe same in amount and dual character as the other; and in the insulated\r\nVoltaic battery, where the sustaining power is internal, not the\r\nslightest development of the forces of either of these can occur till\r\nthe circuit is completed or induction allowed at the extremities; for if\r\nwhen there is no circuit the induction be prevented, not merely no\r\ncurrent, but no quantity of electricity at the poles ready to produce a\r\ncurrent, can be evolved in the slightest degree.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION XXXIV.\r\n\r\nMagnetism a Dual Power—Antithetic Character of Paramagnetism and\r\n  Diamagnetism—The Earth Paramagnetic—Properties of Paramagnetic\r\n  Bodies—Polarity—Induction—Lines of Magnetic Force—Currents of\r\n  Electricity induced by them—Proved to be Closed Curves—Analogy and\r\n  Identity of Electricity and Magnetism—Terrestrial Magnetism—Mean\r\n  Values of the Three Magnetic Elements—Their Variations in Double\r\n  Progression proved to consist of Two Superposed Variations—Discovery\r\n  of the Periodicity of the Magnetic Storms—The Decennial Period of the\r\n  Magnetic Elements the same with that of the Solar Spots—Magnetism of\r\n  the Atmosphere—Diamagnetism—Action of Electro-Magnetism on\r\n  Paramagnetic, Diamagnetic Bodies, and on Copper, very different—Proof\r\n  of Diamagnetic Polarity and Induction—Magnecrystallic Action—Effects\r\n  of Compression, Heat, and Cleavage on Magnetic Bodies—Mutual\r\n  Dependence of Light, Heat, Electricity, &c. &c.—The Conservation of\r\n  Force and the Permanency of Matter Primary Laws of Nature—Definition\r\n  of Gravity not according to that Law—Gravity only the Residual Force\r\n  of a Universal Power—Magnetism of the Ethereal Medium.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETISM may be regarded as a new science in consequence of the\r\nprofound researches and admirable discoveries of Dr. Faraday. Since the\r\nmagnetism of matter is only known by the action of a magnet or of\r\nelectricity upon it, by using an extremely energetic magnet or\r\nelectro-magnet he has proved that all known substances, whether solid,\r\nliquid, or aëriform, are more or less magnetic, but that the magnetism\r\nis very different in different substances. For example, if a bar of iron\r\nbe freely suspended between the poles of a very powerful magnet or\r\nelectro-magnet, it will be attracted by both poles, and will set or rest\r\nin the direction of a straight line joining them; but if a similar bar\r\nof bismuth be freely suspended in the same manner, it will rest in a\r\ndirection at right angles to that which the iron bar assumed. Thus the\r\ndirection in which the iron sets is axial or in the line of force, while\r\nthat which the bismuth assumes is equatorial or perpendicular to the\r\nline of force. Substances that are magnetic after the manner of iron are\r\nsaid to be paramagnetic, those that are magnetic after the manner of\r\nbismuth are diamagnetic. As far as we know, all matter comes under one\r\nor other of these laws. Many bodies are paramagnetic besides iron, as\r\nthe loadstone, which consists of the peroxide and protoxide of iron\r\nmixed with small portions of silica and alumina; also some of the gems\r\nand metals, as cobalt, nickel, &c. A substance is often paramagnetic if\r\nit contains only the 130,000th part of its weight of iron; but by far\r\nthe greater number are diamagnetic, as all animal and vegetable matter,\r\nacids, oils, sugar, starch, bread, &c., and all the gases except oxygen,\r\nwhich is highly paramagnetic; and its force increases with its density:\r\nbut notwithstanding the predominance of diamagnetic matter at the\r\nsurface, the terrestrial globe is paramagnetic—in fact it is a powerful\r\nmagnet.\r\n\r\nBesides the substances which are paramagnetic naturally, that property\r\nmay be imparted by a variety of methods, as by friction with magnets or\r\neven juxtaposition with them; and a bar of hard steel held at the angle\r\nof the dip will become a magnet on receiving a few strokes with a hammer\r\non its upper end.\r\n\r\nPolarity is one of the most distinguishing characters of magnetism: it\r\nis the property which a magnet possesses when freely suspended of\r\nresting spontaneously in the magnetic meridian, or nearly north and\r\nsouth, and always returning to that position when disturbed in\r\nconsequence of the mean magnetic attraction of the earth; yet the magnet\r\nhas no tendency to move to the north or south even when floating on\r\nwater, because the same pole that attracts one end repels the other.\r\nBoth poles of a magnet attract iron, which in return attracts either\r\npole of the magnet with an equal and contrary force. The action of a\r\nmagnet on unmagnetised iron is confined to attraction, whereas the\r\nreciprocal agency of magnets is characterised by a repulsive as well as\r\nby an attractive force; for a north pole repels a north pole, and a\r\nsouth pole repels a south pole; but a north and south pole mutually\r\nattract one another—which proves that paramagnetism is a dual power in\r\nwhich the conservation of force is perfectly maintained, for the force\r\nof attraction is exactly equal to the force of repulsion. One kind of\r\npolarity cannot exist without the other: they are absolutely\r\nsimultaneous, dependent, and of equal intensity.\r\n\r\nInduction is the power which a magnet possesses of exciting temporary or\r\npermanent paramagnetism in such bodies in its vicinity as are capable of\r\nreceiving it. By this property the mere approach of a magnet renders\r\niron and steel paramagnetic, the more powerfully the less the distance,\r\nbut the induced force is always exactly equal to the force which\r\nproduces it. When the north end of a magnet is brought near to, and in\r\nthe line with, an unmagnetised iron bar, the bar acquires all the\r\nproperties of a perfect magnet; the end next the north pole of the\r\nmagnet becomes a south pole, while the remote end becomes a north pole.\r\nExactly the reverse takes place when the south end is presented to the\r\nbar, so that each pole of a magnet induces the opposite polarity in the\r\nadjacent end of the bar, and the same polarity in the remote extremity;\r\nconsequently the nearest extremity of the bar is attracted, and the\r\nfarther repelled; but as the action is greater on the adjacent than on\r\nthe distant part, the resulting force is that of attraction. By\r\ninduction the iron bar not only acquires polarity, but the power of\r\ninducing paramagnetism in a third body; and although all these\r\nproperties vanish from the iron as soon as the magnet is removed, a\r\nlasting increase of intensity is generally imparted to the magnet itself\r\nby the reaction of the temporary paramagnetism of the iron. Iron\r\nacquires the inductive force more rapidly than steel, yet it loses it as\r\nquickly on the removal of the magnet, whereas the steel is impressed\r\nwith a lasting polarity.\r\n\r\nA certain time is requisite for induction, and it may be accelerated by\r\nanything that excites a vibratory motion in the particles of the steel;\r\nsuch as the smart stroke of a hammer, or heat succeeded by sudden cold.\r\nA steel bar may be converted into a magnet by the transmission of an\r\nelectric discharge through it; and as its efficacy is the same in\r\nwhatever direction the electricity passes, the effect arises from its\r\nmechanical operation exciting a vibration among the particles of the\r\nsteel. It has been observed that the particles of iron easily resume\r\ntheir neutral state after induction, while those of steel resist the\r\nrestoration of equilibrium, or a return to the neutral state: it is\r\ntherefore evident that any cause which removes or diminishes the\r\nresistance of the particles will tend to destroy the paramagnetism of\r\nthe steel; consequently the same mechanical means which develop the\r\npower will also destroy it. On that account a steel bar may lose its\r\nparamagnetism by any mechanical concussion, such as by falling on a hard\r\nsubstance, a blow with a hammer, and heating to redness, which makes the\r\nsteel soft. The circumstances which determine whether it shall gain or\r\nlose are its position with respect to the magnetic equator, and the\r\nhigher or lower intensity of its previous magnetic state.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the number of vibrations accomplished by the same\r\nmagnetised needle during the same time at different distances from a\r\nmagnet gives the law of paramagnetic intensity, which follows the\r\ninverse ratio of the square of the distance—a law that is not affected\r\nby the intervention of any substance whatever between the magnet and the\r\nneedle, provided the substance be not itself susceptible of magnetism.\r\nInduction and the reciprocal action of magnets are therefore subject to\r\nthe laws of mechanics; but the composition and resolution of the forces\r\nare complicated in consequence of four forces being constantly in\r\nactivity, two in each magnet. Mr. Were Fox discovered that the law of\r\nthe paramagnetic force changes from the inverse square of the distance\r\nto the simple inverse ratio when the distance between two magnets is as\r\nsmall as from the fourth to the eighth of an inch, or even as much as\r\nhalf an inch when the magnets are large; and in the case of repulsion,\r\nthat the change takes place at a still greater distance, especially when\r\nthe two magnets differ materially in intensity.\r\n\r\nWithout assuming any hypothesis of what magnetism is, or how that force\r\nis originated or sustained, Dr. Faraday regards a magnet as a source of\r\npower surrounded by curved lines of force which are not only\r\nrepresentants of the magnetic power in quality and direction, but also\r\nin quantity—an hypothesis which accords perfectly with experiment, and\r\nwith the action both of electricity and magnetism. The nature and form\r\nof these lines may be seen by placing a bar magnet upon a table,\r\nspreading a sheet of stiff paper over it so as to be perfectly level and\r\nfree from creases, and then sifting very clean iron filings through a\r\nfine sieve equably over it. The filings will instantly assume the form\r\nof the curved lines represented by fig. 1, plate 7, in consequence of\r\nthe action of the magnet. These lines are the true representatives of\r\nthe magnetic forces, and being related to a polar power, they have\r\nopposite qualities in opposite directions. When a magnet is broken\r\nacross the middle, each part is at once converted into a perfect magnet;\r\nthe part that originally had a south pole acquires a north pole at the\r\nfractured end; the part that had originally a north pole gets a south\r\npole; and as far as mechanical division can be carried, it is found that\r\neach fragment is a perfect magnet. Fig. 2, plate 7, shows the lines of\r\nforce in a fractured magnet when the ends are not yet separated; fig. 3\r\nshows them when they are.\r\n\r\nCurrents of electricity are produced in conducting bodies moved across\r\nthese lines of magnetic force. If a copper wire at a little distance\r\nabove the north pole of a bar magnet be moved from left to right, at any\r\nangle across the lines of magnetic force, they will induce a current of\r\nelectricity in the wire flowing from right to left; if the wire be moved\r\nwith the same velocity in the contrary direction, the induced current\r\nwill be of equal intensity, but it will flow from left to right. Similar\r\nresults are obtained from the south pole, and the phenomena are the same\r\nwhen the magnet is moved and the wire is at rest; in both cases the\r\nintensity is greater the swifter the motion. It appears that the\r\nquantity of electricity induced is directly as the amount of the\r\nmagnetic curves intersected, and when a wire is moving uniformly in a\r\nfield of equal magnetic force, the current of electricity generated is\r\nproportional to the time, and also to the velocity of motion; for when a\r\nmetallic disc is made to revolve through the lines of force, the current\r\ninduced is strongest near the edge where the velocity is greatest; and\r\nin different substances moving across the lines of force the intensity\r\nof the induced current is directly as the conducting power of the\r\nsubstance. Thus bodies moved near a magnet have an electrical current\r\ndeveloped in them, and conversely bodies affected by an electric current\r\nare definitely moved by a magnet near them.\r\n\r\nBy the preceding experiments it appears that magnetic polarity is\r\nmanifested in two ways; in the magnetised needle, by attraction and\r\nrepulsion, and in a wire moving across lines of magnetic force it is\r\nshown by the opposite directions in which the induced current flows\r\naccording as the body is moved from the right to the left, or left to\r\nright. Hence polarity consists in the opposite and antithetical actions\r\nmanifested at the opposite ends or opposite sides of a limited or\r\nunlimited line of force. Antithesis is the true and most general\r\ncharacter of magnetism, whatever may be its mode of action.\r\n\r\nIt was by the induction of electric currents in copper wires moving\r\nacross the lines of magnetic force that Dr. Faraday proved that the\r\nlines of force issuing from a magnet are closed curves which return\r\nagain and pass through the interior of the magnet. He placed two bar\r\nmagnets of the same length, size, and intensity with their similar poles\r\ntogether, so that they might act as one magnet. A copper wire was then\r\npassed between their axes, which after extending through half their\r\nlength was bent up equatorially and turned back along the outside, so\r\nthat the whole wire formed a loop, the two ends being connected with a\r\ngalvanometer. When the whole wire was made to revolve, no effect was\r\nproduced, although it crossed the lines of magnetic force; but when it\r\nwas cut in two, so as to separate the external from the internal part,\r\nelectrical currents of equal intensity, but in contrary directions, were\r\ninduced in each portion of the wire as they were made separately to\r\ncross the lines of force, for the apparatus was so constructed that that\r\ncould be done. The exterior wire crossed the lines of force which issued\r\nfrom the magnets at right angles to their axes, while the equatorial\r\npart of the interior wire traversed the returning lines of force. It is\r\nevident that these forces neutralized each other when the whole wire\r\nrevolved: consequently the internal and external lines of force must\r\nhave been of equal intensity and opposite in direction, so as to balance\r\none another. By this and a very great number of other experiments Dr.\r\nFaraday has proved that the magnetic lines of force are continuous\r\nclosed curves alike in shape, size, and power. They extend indefinitely\r\nbeyond the magnet, and undergo no change by distance.\r\n\r\nThus the magnetic force pervades the interior of the mass; if\r\nelectricity does the same, a compensation must either take place, or it\r\nalso must move in lines of force, sensible only at the surface.\r\nElectricity has a perpetual tendency to escape, and does escape, when\r\nnot prevented by the coercive power of the air, and other non-conducting\r\nsubstances. Such a tendency does not exist in magnetism, which never\r\nleaves the substance containing it under any circumstances whatever.\r\nThere must be some coercive force, analogous to friction, which arrests\r\nthe magnetic forces, so as first to oppose their separation, and then to\r\nprevent their reunion. In soft iron the coercive force is either wanting\r\nor extremely feeble, since iron is easily rendered paramagnetic by\r\ninduction, and as easily loses that quality; whereas in steel the\r\ncoercive force is extremely energetic, because it prevents the steel\r\nfrom acquiring the paramagnetic properties rapidly, and entirely hinders\r\nit from losing them when acquired. The feebleness of the coercive force\r\nin iron, and its energy in steel, with regard to the paramagnetic force,\r\nis perfectly analogous to the facility of transmission afforded to\r\nelectricity by non-electrics, and the resistance it experiences in\r\nelectrics. At every step the analogy between electricity and magnetism\r\nbecomes more striking. The agency of attraction and repulsion is common\r\nto both; the positive and negative electricities are similar to the\r\nnorthern and southern polarities, and are governed by the same\r\nlaws—namely, that between like powers there is repulsion, and between\r\nunlike powers there is attraction. Each of these four forces is capable\r\nof acting most energetically when alone; but as the electric equilibrium\r\nis restored by the union of the two electric states, and magnetic\r\nneutrality by the combination of the two polarities, they respectively\r\nneutralise each other when joined. All these forces vary inversely as\r\nthe square of the distance, and consequently come under the same\r\nmechanical laws.\r\n\r\nA like analogy extends to magnetic and electric induction. Iron and\r\nsteel are in a state of equilibrium when neutral; but this equilibrium\r\nis immediately disturbed on the approach of the pole of a magnet, which\r\nby induction transfers one kind of polarity to one end of an iron or\r\nsteel bar, and the opposite kind to the other—effects exactly similar to\r\nelectrical induction. There is even a correspondence between the\r\nfracture of a magnet and that of an electric conductor; for if an oblong\r\nconductor be electrified by induction, its two extremities will have\r\nopposite electricities; and if in that state it be divided across the\r\nmiddle, the two portions, when removed to a distance from one another,\r\nwill each retain the electricity that has been induced upon it. The\r\nanalogy, however, does not extend to transference. A body may transfer a\r\nredundant quantity of positive electricity to another, or deprive\r\nanother of its electricity—the one gaining at the expense of the other;\r\nbut a body cannot possess only one kind of polarity. With that\r\nexception, there is such perfect correspondence between the theories of\r\nmagnetic attractions and repulsions, and electric forces in conducting\r\nbodies, that they not only are the same in principle, but are determined\r\nby the same formulæ. Experiment concurs with theory in proving the\r\nidentity of these two influences. Hence, if the electrical phenomena be\r\ndue to a modification of the ethereal medium, the magnetic phenomena\r\nmust be owing to an analogous cause.\r\n\r\nCurved lines of magnetic force issue from every point of the earth’s\r\nsurface where there is sensible dip, and bending round enter the earth\r\nagain at the magnetic equator. They induce electric currents in\r\nconducting-wires, moving across them exactly the same as in artificial\r\nmagnets; and when a hollow helix, or coil of copper wire, whose\r\nextremities are connected with a galvanometer, is placed in the magnetic\r\ndip, and suddenly moved across the lines of force, the needle of the\r\ngalvanometer will vibrate through an arc of 80° or 90°, in consequence\r\nof the electric current induced by these lines of magnetic force in the\r\nwire, and the action is greater when a core of soft iron is placed in\r\nthe helix, which becomes a temporary magnet by induction. Again, if a\r\ncopper plate be connected with a galvanometer by two copper wires, one\r\nfrom the centre, and another from the circumference, in order to collect\r\nand convey the electricity, it is found that, when the plate is made to\r\nrevolve in a plane passing through the line of the dip, the galvanometer\r\nis not affected. But as soon as the plate is inclined to that plane,\r\nelectricity begins to be developed by its motion across the lines of\r\nmagnetic force; it becomes more powerful as the inclination increases,\r\nand arrives at a maximum when the plate revolves at right angles to the\r\nline of dip. When the revolution is in the same direction with that of\r\nthe hands of a watch, the current of electricity flows from its centre\r\nto the circumference; and when the rotation is in a contrary direction,\r\nthe current sets the opposite way. Thus a copper plate, revolving at\r\nright angles to the line of the dip, becomes a new electrical machine,\r\ndiffering from the common plate-glass machine by the copper being the\r\nmost perfect conductor, whereas glass is the most perfect non-conductor;\r\nbesides insulation, which is essential to the glass machine, is fatal to\r\nthe copper one. The quantity of electricity evolved by the metal does\r\nnot appear to be inferior to that devolved by the glass, though very\r\ndifferent in intensity. Even a ship crossing the lines of force must\r\nhave electric currents running through her. Dr. Faraday observes that\r\nsuch is the facility with which electricity is generated by the magnetic\r\nlines of force, that scarcely any piece of metal can be moved without a\r\ndevelopment of it; consequently, among the arrangements of steam-engines\r\nand metallic machinery, curious electro-magnetic combinations probably\r\nexist which have never yet been noticed. Thus magnetic lines of force\r\ncertainly issue from the surface of the globe.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the earth is a magnet on a vast scale, but it differs from all\r\nothers in having four poles of maximum magnetic force of different\r\nintensities, the two in the northern hemisphere having a secular motion\r\nin a contrary direction from the two in the southern. They are not even\r\nsymmetrically placed; hence the magnetic intensity varies so much in the\r\ndifferent points on the earth’s surface, that the dynamic equator, or\r\nline passing through all the points of least intensity, is a very\r\nirregular curve surrounding the globe, but by no means coinciding with\r\nthe terrestrial equator. In consequence of the mean action of these four\r\nforces, the north end of a magnetised needle, arranged so as to revolve\r\nin a vertical plane, dips or inclines beneath the horizon in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, and the south end in the southern. The two\r\nhemispheres are separated by a line encircling the earth, called the\r\nmagnetic equator, or line of no dip, in which the dipping or inclination\r\nneedle is horizontal. On each side of this line the inclination\r\nincreases till at last the needle becomes perpendicular to the horizon\r\nin two points, or rather small spaces, in each hemisphere, known as the\r\nmagnetic poles, which are quite different from the poles of the earth’s\r\nrotation. The mean action of the four poles of magnetic intensity causes\r\nthe mariner’s compass, or a magnetic needle suspended so as to revolve\r\nin a horizontal plane, to remain at rest when pointing to the two\r\nmagnetic poles. It is then in the magnetic meridian of the place of\r\nobservation, which is thus determined by the mean action of all the four\r\nmagnetic forces.\r\n\r\nThese mean values of the three magnetic elements, namely, the\r\ndeclination, inclination or dip, and magnetic intensity, are well known\r\nto be subject to secular, annual, and diurnal variations. The secular\r\nonly become sensible after some years, but the annual and diurnal\r\nvariations have a double progression—that is to say, two maximum and two\r\nminimum values in their respective periods of a year and twenty-four\r\nhours; for example, the declination needle makes two deviations to the\r\nwest and two to the east in the course of twenty-four hours, and that\r\nwith great regularity. Now General Sabine discovered that the double\r\nprogression arises from two combined or superposed variations having\r\ndifferent hours of maxima and minima, and that they are due to two\r\ndistinctly different causes—the one being the difference in the sun’s\r\nposition relatively to the place of observation at the different seasons\r\nof the year, and hours of the day and night; the other being a mean\r\nannual and diurnal variation proved by General Sabine to exist in those\r\ngreat magnetic storms or casual disturbances which affect the magnetic\r\nelements simultaneously over enormously extensive tracts of the globe.\r\n\r\nMoreover the General discovered that, besides these annual and diurnal\r\nvariations, the magnetic storms have a variation which accomplishes its\r\nvicissitudes in ten or more nearly eleven years, the increase from year\r\nto year being gradual, till its maximum becomes twice as great as its\r\nminimum value. In consequence of this inequality in the storms or casual\r\ndisturbances, each of the magnetic elements has a variation of similar\r\nperiod and similar maxima and minima. Now the number and magnitude of\r\nthe spots on the sun had been observed by M. Schwabe, of Dessau, to\r\nincrease to a maximum, and decrease again to a minimum, regularly in the\r\nvery same period of between ten and eleven years; and General Sabine\r\nfound that this variation in the solar spots, and that in the magnetic\r\nelements, not only have the same periods of maxima and minima, but that\r\nthey correspond in all their minutest vicissitudes. Thus a very\r\nremarkable and unexpected connexion exists between terrestrial and solar\r\nmagnetism. The dual and antagonist principle is perfectly maintained in\r\nthe earth’s magnetism, all the phenomena and their variations being in\r\nopposite directions in the two hemispheres. (N. 226.)\r\n\r\nNo doubt the magnetic lines of force in the earth are closed curves, as\r\nin artificial magnets; but in their circuitous courses they may extend\r\nto any distance in space, or rather in the ethereal medium, even to\r\nthousands or tens of thousands of miles; for the ethereal medium is\r\npermeable to lines of magnetic force, or rather transmits them,\r\notherwise the solar spots could not affect the variations of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism; besides, they pass through the Torricellian vacuum, which is\r\nnearly a void with respect to air, but not to the ethereal medium.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere which surrounds the earth to the height of about fifty\r\nmiles with sensible density, consists of three and a half parts by\r\nweight of nitrogen gas and one part of oxygen, uniformly mixed. The\r\nnitrogen is neutral whether dense or rare, hot or cold, while the oxygen\r\nis highly paramagnetic; but it loses a great part of its force when\r\nrarefied by heat; consequently the magnetic force of the atmosphere must\r\nincrease from the equator to the poles of maximum cold; it must vary\r\nsummer and winter, night and day. Its effect upon terrestrial magnetism\r\nis unknown; but it can hardly be without some influence. M. E. Becquerel\r\nobserves—“If we reflect that the earth is encompassed by a mass of air\r\nequivalent in weight to a layer of mercury of 30 inches, we may inquire\r\nwhether such a mass of magnetic gas, continually agitated, and submitted\r\nto the regular and irregular variations of pressure and temperature,\r\ndoes not intervene in some of the phenomena dependent upon terrestrial\r\nmagnetism. If we calculate, in fact, what is the magnetic force of this\r\nfluid mass, we find that it is equivalent to an immense plate of iron,\r\nof a thickness little more than 1/250 of an inch, which covers the whole\r\nsurface of the globe.” Both the conducting power of the air and its\r\ndensity are increased by cold; and as the sum of the magnetic forces\r\nwhich issue from the earth on one side of the line of no dip is equal to\r\ntheir sum on the other side, the intensity and concentration in our\r\nwinter are coincident with a diffusion and feebleness in the opposite\r\nhemisphere, so that the line of no dip will move annually from north to\r\nsouth and back again. The same holds with regard to day and night. Thus\r\nthe law of the conservation of force is rigorously maintained; and it is\r\nequally so in the effect of the atmosphere on the magnetic lines of\r\nforce, which refracts them as they pass through it, in one direction in\r\nsummer, and in the opposite direction in winter—in one direction in the\r\nenlightened hemisphere, in the other in that which is dark. The whole of\r\nthe magnetic lines about the earth are held by their mutual tension in\r\none connected, sensitive system, which feels in every part, even to the\r\nantipodes, a change in any particular place.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned as a well-known fact, that apparent anomalies have\r\nbeen found in the diurnal variation of the declination in the high\r\nmagnetic latitudes of the northern hemisphere when compared with their\r\ngreat regularity in other parts of the same hemisphere, and that the\r\nmagnetic storms are of much greater magnitude there than in lower\r\nlatitudes. Moreover, although Captain Maguire’s observations at Cape\r\nBarrow, in the North Polar Ocean, show that the annual and diurnal\r\nvariations of the casual disturbances or magnetic storms, as well as\r\nthose of the decennial period, are maintained, yet it appears that at\r\ncertain hours of the day the disturbance in the declination may be\r\neasterly at Point Barrow, and westerly at the Magnetic Observatory at\r\nToronto, in Upper Canada, and _vice versâ_: in fact, the magnetic storms\r\nare simultaneous at these two stations, but in opposite directions—a\r\ncircumstance not yet accounted for, and may possibly be due to the\r\nincreased magnetism of the air in these cold regions. The heat of the\r\nsun has no effect upon terrestrial magnetism unless possibly by its\r\nindirect action on the oxygen of the atmosphere; but hitherto it has\r\nbeen imperceptible. It is hardly possible that the aurora can be\r\nindependent of the magnetic character of the air, since it occurs in the\r\nhigh latitudes, where the atmospheric magnetism is most powerful.\r\nCaptain Maguire remarked that it frequently appeared at Point Barrow\r\nwhen the magnetic storms were at a maximum.\r\n\r\nWe are totally ignorant of the cause of terrestrial magnetism, though\r\nthe powerful influence of the solar spots renders it highly probable\r\nthat it will ultimately be found to originate in the sun himself. Mr.\r\nBarlow’s theory of electric currents revolving round the globe is borne\r\nout by Mr. Fox’s observations in the Cornish mines, which show that\r\nelectro-magnetism is extremely active in metallic veins; that not only\r\nthe nature of the metalliferous deposits must have been determined by\r\ntheir relative electrical conditions, but that the direction of the\r\nmetallic veins must have been influenced by the direction of the\r\nmagnetic meridians, and in fact almost all the metallic deposits in the\r\nworld tend from east to west, or from north-east to south-west. However,\r\nthese currents of electricity may be regarded as magnetic lines of\r\nforce, and are more likely to be the effect than the cause of\r\nterrestrial magnetism. They are found to have a powerful inductive\r\neffect on the Atlantic telegraph, disturbing the needles and\r\ngalvanometers at each end of the line to a considerable degree, and on\r\nthe night of the 6th of September, 1858, a magnetic storm passed over\r\nthe cable, which violently agitated the reflecting galvanometer in\r\nconnection with the telegraphic wires.\r\n\r\nWe are equally ignorant of the cause of the secular magnetic variations,\r\nbut we have no reason to believe that the earth is alone magnetic; on\r\nthe contrary, the planets are probably magnets, and we know that the sun\r\nand moon are magnetic; hence, as the magnetic, like the gravitating\r\nforce, is transmitted through the ethereal medium, the induction of the\r\nsun, moon, and planets, in all their secular and periodic changes, may\r\ncause perpetual variations in terrestrial magnetism, and it may not be\r\nbeyond the delicacy of modern observation to ascertain whether a planet,\r\nwhen nearest to the earth, has any sensible magnetism.\r\n\r\nDiamagnetism is also a dual power, but in complete antithesis to\r\nparamagnetism under the same circumstances. Dr. Faraday first discovered\r\nthis property in heavy glass, or silico-borate of lead, a piece of which\r\nwas repelled by the pole of a powerful electro-magnet, and an elongated\r\nprism of the same heavy glass, when freely suspended between the poles,\r\nset equatorially. He then found that so great a number of substances\r\nfollowed the same law, that it established the very remarkable fact of a\r\nhitherto unknown force having acted upon the substances submitted to its\r\ninfluence, a discovery which he subsequently confirmed by many\r\nexperiments, all of which proved the antithesis between the two modes of\r\nmagnetic action. He also discovered that magnetic bodies differ\r\nexceedingly in their magnetic power: of paramagnetic bodies iron is the\r\nmost powerful; then follow nickel, cobalt, and a long gradation down to\r\nosmium and a vacuum. The body that seems to have the lowest diamagnetic\r\npower is arsenic, and the series ascends to heavy glass, antimony,\r\nphosphorus, and bismuth; so iron and bismuth are the most powerful in\r\ntheir respective classes, and both have a small conducting power for\r\nelectricity. It may be presumed that many remarkable instances of\r\ndiamagnetism are to be met with in nature; among others, Dr. Faraday has\r\nsuggested the idea that Saturn’s ring, from its position, may be\r\ndiamagnetic with regard to the planet.\r\n\r\nWith very powerful magnets or electro-magnets, which are absolutely\r\nnecessary for all these experiments, it is found that no _simple_\r\nsubstance is neutral, but that such may be compounded by mixing in due\r\nproportion a diamagnetic and paramagnetic liquid, as water and\r\nprotosulphate of iron.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall proved diamagnetic polarity by placing two bismuth\r\nbars within two vertical coils or spirals of insulated copper wire,\r\nthrough which electric currents were transmitted from a galvanic\r\nbattery, and caused to act upon a steel magnet freely suspended without\r\nthe spirals. Now, when the excited magnetism is merely by induction, the\r\nelectric current, being momentary, only causes a shock or momentary\r\ndeviation in the magnet, which returns to its original position when the\r\ncurrent ceases. When, on the contrary, the magnetism is permanent, the\r\nsuspended magnet does not return to its original position when the\r\ncurrent ceases. In Professor Tyndall’s experiment the deviation was\r\npermanent, and it was equally so when a bismuth bar was freely suspended\r\nand the cores within the spirals were steel magnets. Had the effect been\r\nfrom currents induced in the mass of the bar of bismuth, division of the\r\nbar would have stopped them, but the result was the same with powdered\r\nbismuth as with the solid mass. Moreover, since the strength of induced\r\ncurrents depends upon the conducting power of the substance, and as the\r\nconducting power of copper is forty times as great as that of bismuth,\r\nhad the polarity been induced and not real, the effect ought to have\r\nbeen forty times greater when copper instead of bismuth cores were put\r\nin the spirals, whereas it was scarcely sensible. Besides these proofs,\r\nDr. Tyndall made experiments with eleven different diamagnetic\r\nsubstances, of which water was one, with similar results. He then\r\ndetermined the polarity of twelve paramagnetic bodies by the same\r\nmethod, whence it appeared that the same action which produced a north\r\npole in the paramagnetic bodies produced a south pole in those that were\r\ndiamagnetic, and _vice versâ_, whence he concludes that diamagnetic\r\npolarity is one of the most firmly established truths of science. It\r\nfollows from this that, when a man is standing, his head is a north pole\r\nand his feet a south, and the top of an iron railing on which he may be\r\nleaning is a south pole and the lower end a north. Diamagnetic bodies\r\nthus possess a polarity, the same in kind but opposite in direction to\r\nthat possessed by paramagnetic ones.[18] They are both dual powers, and\r\nthe two diamagnetic forces like the two paramagnetic being coexistent,\r\nsimultaneous, and mutually dependent, there can be no doubt that the\r\ndiamagnetic forces also are represented, or rather consist of curved and\r\nclosed lines of force passing through the interior of the substance. Dr.\r\nTyndall has proved that the attraction of iron, and the repulsion of\r\nbismuth, are as the square of the electro-magnetic current producing\r\nthem, and that diamagnetic substances are capable of induction.\r\n\r\nThe molecular structure of substances freely suspended between the poles\r\nof a magnet has a decided effect upon the position they assume.\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that the optic axis is a symmetrical line\r\nin a doubly refracting crystal in which there is no double refraction,\r\nand that in some crystals there are two such symmetrical lines. Now,\r\nProfessor Plücker of Bonn discovered, when such crystals are submitted\r\nto powerful magnetic influence, that the single optic axis in the one,\r\nand the resultant or mean line between the double optic axes in the\r\nother, set diametrically or at right angles to the line of magnetic\r\nforce; and so powerful did the Professor find the action of magnetism on\r\ncrystalline form, that the mineral cyanite, when suspended, arranges\r\nitself so definitely with regard to terrestrial magnetism, that it might\r\nbe used as a compass needle.\r\n\r\nDr. Faraday afterwards observed that amorphous substances, cut in the\r\nform of a sphere, have no tendency to set or be attracted or repelled in\r\none direction in preference to any other; but if the sphere be formed of\r\na crystallized substance, it is a general fact that, whether it be\r\nparamagnetic or diamagnetic, it is more powerfully attracted or repelled\r\nin one direction than in any other—a property named by Dr. Faraday\r\nmagnecrystallic action. For example, a sphere of calcareous spar, which\r\nis a diamagnetic crystal, is most strongly repelled in the direction of\r\nits principal optic axis, and least strongly in the direction of its\r\nleast axis. In a sphere of carbonate of iron, which has exactly the same\r\ncrystalline form and is highly paramagnetic, the line which in carbonate\r\nof lime sets equatorially, in this case sets axially, and more strongly\r\nin that direction than in any other. The law according to which the\r\nattraction of the carbonate of iron increases from the least to its\r\ngreatest or principal optic axis, is precisely the same as that\r\naccording to which the repulsion of the calcareous spar increases from\r\nthe least to the principal optic axis. These relations are not altered\r\nby the immersion of the spheres in liquids of either magnetism. Dr.\r\nFaraday observed that a line at right angles to the planes of principal\r\ncleavage in crystals takes the axial position, and on that account he\r\ncalled it the magnecrystallic axis. Its position was proved by MM.\r\nTyndall and Knoblauch to depend upon the general fact, that the mass is\r\nmost strongly repelled in the direction of the planes of principal\r\ncleavage, and that the elective position of crystals depends more upon\r\nthe direction of these planes with respect to the electric force, than\r\nupon the optic axis. The planes of principal cleavage set themselves\r\nequatorially in diamagnetic, and axially in paramagnetic substances: it\r\nwas thence inferred that the phenomena offered by crystals in the\r\nmagnetic field is a particular case of the general law, that the\r\nsuperior action of magnets upon matter in a particular direction is due\r\nto the particles of the body being closer together in that direction\r\nthan in any other: in short, the line of maximum density; the force\r\nexerted being attractive or repulsive according as the particles are\r\nparamagnetic or diamagnetic.\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, that the set of crystals with regard to the line of\r\nmagnetic force does not depend solely upon their density in particular\r\ndirections. Professor Matteucci, of Pisa, has proved that the\r\ndiamagnetic force is inversely as the conducting power of substances for\r\nelectricity, that the conducting power is a maximum in the planes of\r\nprincipal cleavage, and that a needle of crystallized bismuth, in which\r\nthe planes of cleavage are parallel to its length, places itself\r\nequatorially with more force when these planes are vertical, or at right\r\nangles to the force, than when they are horizontal or parallel to it.\r\nExperiments had hitherto been made only with diamagnetic or slightly\r\nparamagnetic bodies, which induced M. le Roux to try the effect of\r\nmagnetism on pulverized iron compressed by the hydraulic press, which\r\nreduced the grains of iron to lamellæ equivalent to planes of cleavage.\r\nCubes of this substance, suspended by a thread over a horseshoe magnet,\r\noscillated for a longer time when the lamellæ were perpendicular than\r\nwhen they were horizontal; that is, the force was stronger when the\r\nlamellæ were equatorial than when they were axial, exactly the same\r\nresult as in Professor Matteucci’s experiment with the needle of\r\nbismuth. Thus the vertical position of the cleavages, which increases\r\nthe diamagnetism of the bismuth, increases also the paramagnetism of the\r\niron. M. le Roux observes that these results are independent of the\r\ninfluence of the currents of electricity induced in the oscillating\r\nbody, for the fundamental character of the phenomena of Arago’s\r\ndiscovery of rotation by induction is, that the oscillations diminish\r\nrapidly in extent without any sensible diminution in their duration,\r\nwhile in his experiments the time of the oscillations varied. He\r\nconcludes that the arrangement of the molecules must be intimately\r\nconnected with paramagnetism or diamagnetism itself, since the effect of\r\nthat arrangement is equally sensible in bismuth and iron, although the\r\ndiamagnetism of the former is 25,000 times weaker than the paramagnetism\r\nof the latter.\r\n\r\nThe diamagnetism of conducting substances and metals, such as gold,\r\nsilver, and copper, is augmented by division. Compression has also a\r\ngreat effect on magnetic action. For example, a bar of soft iron sets\r\nwith its longest dimensions from pole to pole of a magnet, but a bar of\r\ncompressed carbonate of iron-dust, whose shortest dimensions coincide\r\nwith the line of pressure, sets equatorially. A bar of bismuth whose\r\nplane of principal cleavage is parallel to its length sets equatorially,\r\nbut a bar of compressed bismuth dust, whose shortest dimensions coincide\r\nwith the line of pressure, or a bar of bismuth whose principal planes of\r\ncleavage are transverse to its length, sets with its length axially. The\r\nantithesis is perfect whether the bars are under the influence of a\r\nmagnet or electro-magnet. For since the diamagnetic force is inversely\r\nas the conducting power of a body for electricity, and that the latter\r\nis a maximum in the direction of the planes of principal cleavage,\r\ntherefore when these planes are parallel to the axis of the bismuth bar\r\nit sets equatorially; but as the conducting power is augmented when the\r\nbismuth dust is compressed in the direction of the force, the\r\ndiamagnetic power is diminished, and the bar sets axially. Again, since\r\nthe paramagnetic force augments with the conducting power, the action of\r\nthe magnet on the iron is antithetic to that on the bismuth.\r\n\r\nThe action of an electro-magnet on copper is strongly contrasted with\r\nthat which it exerts on iron or bismuth. For when a copper bar suspended\r\nby a thread revolves before its pole, it is brought to a dead halt as\r\nsoon as the electric current acts upon it, and maintains its position\r\nwith considerable tenacity, for it does not return when pushed out of\r\nit, but keeps its new place with stiffness; however, as soon as the\r\nelectric current ceases, there is a strong revulsion, the bar revolving\r\nthe contrary way. Even when swinging with considerable force it may be\r\ncaught and retained in any position at pleasure, but there is no\r\nrevulsion when it is arrested either in the axial or equatorial\r\nposition; at any angle between these two, but especially midway, the\r\nelectricity will make it move towards the axis, but it is arrested\r\nbefore it comes to it. The action depends much on the form and\r\ndimensions of the bar and the magnetic pole, which ought to be flat. The\r\nphenomena are due to the high electro-conducting power of the copper,\r\nand are met with in some of the other pure metals, though in a far\r\ninferior degree.\r\n\r\nGreat magnetic power is requisite for all these experiments. Dr. Faraday\r\nemployed a magnet that could sustain a weight of 450 lbs. at each pole,\r\nand the poles were either pointed or flat surfaces at pleasure, as the\r\nkind of experiment required.\r\n\r\nHeat strongly affects the magnetic properties of bodies. Dr. Faraday\r\nfound that, when the temperature of nickel is increased, its magnetic\r\nforce diminishes; when that of iron is increased its magnetic force\r\nremains the same, while that of cobalt increases; which seems to\r\nindicate that there is a temperature at which the magnetic force is a\r\nmaximum, above and below which it diminishes. Nickel loses its magnetism\r\nat the temperature of boiling oil, iron at a red heat, and cobalt near\r\nthe temperature at which copper melts. Calcareous spar retains its\r\nmagnetic character at a very high temperature; but the same substance\r\nwhen it contains iron, and also oxide of iron, loses it entirely at a\r\ndull red heat. A crystal of the ferrocarbonate of lime was absolutely\r\nreversed by change of temperature, for at a low heat the optic axis\r\npointed axially, and at a high temperature equatorially. With the\r\nexception of these substances, magnecrystals, whether paramagnetic or\r\ndiamagnetic, are generally all affected alike by heat. The difference\r\nbetween the forces in any two different directions, as for instance the\r\ngreatest and least principal axes, diminishes as the temperature is\r\nraised, increases as the temperature is lowered, and is constant for a\r\ngiven temperature. No _unmixed_ or _pure_ substance has as yet passed by\r\nheat from the paramagnetic to the diamagnetic state. No _simple_\r\nmagnecrystal has shown any inversion of this kind, nor have any of the\r\nchief axes of power changed their characters or relations to one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nIt appears that, as the molecules of crystals and compressed bodies\r\naffect magnetism, so magnetism acts upon the molecules of matter, for\r\ntorsion diminishes the magnetic force, and the elasticity of iron and\r\nsteel is altered by magnetism. M. Matteucci has found that the\r\nmechanical compression of glass alters the rotatory power of a polarized\r\nray of light transmitted through it, and that a change takes place in\r\nthe temper of glass under the influence of powerful magnetism.\r\n\r\nEven from the limited view of the powers of nature which precedes, it is\r\nevident that the progress of science based upon experiment tends to show\r\nthat the various forces of light, heat, motion, chemical affinity,\r\nelectricity, and magnetism will ultimately be traced to one common\r\norigin; that they are so directly related, and mutually dependent, that\r\nthey are convertible, motion producing heat, and heat motion; chemical\r\naffinity producing electricity, and electricity chemical action, &c.,\r\neach mediately or immediately producing the other. These forces are\r\ntransmitted through substances; they act upon matter, causing changes in\r\nthe molecular structure of bodies either momentary or permanent, and\r\nreciprocally the changes indicate the action of these forces. Matter and\r\nforce are only known to us as manifestations of Almighty power: we are\r\nassured that we can neither create nor destroy them—that their amount is\r\nthe same now as in the beginning. In chemical attraction the powers with\r\nwhich a molecule of matter is endowed, and which give rise to various\r\nqualities, never change; even when passing through a thousand\r\ncombinations, the molecule and its power are ever the same.\r\n\r\nMachinery does not create force; it only enables us to turn the forces\r\nof nature to the best advantage; it is by the force of wind or falling\r\nwater that our corn is ground, and the steam engine owes its power to\r\nthe force of heat and chemical action. As force cannot be created,\r\nneither can it be annihilated. It may be dispersed in various\r\ndirections, and subdivided so as to become evanescent to our\r\nperceptions; it may be balanced so as to be in abeyance, or become\r\npotential as in static electricity; but the instant the impediment is\r\nremoved the force is manifested by motion; it may also be turned into\r\nheat by friction, but it is never lost. Every motion we make, every\r\nbreath, every word we utter, is a force that produces pulsations which\r\nare communicated to continually increasing particles of air, and\r\nconveyed through countless channels so as to become indeed imperceptible\r\nto our senses, yet they are demonstrated to exist as witnesses of the\r\nwords we have spoken or the actions we have performed, by analysis, that\r\nall-powerful instrument of human reason.[19]\r\n\r\nA body acquires heat in the exact proportion that the adjacent\r\nsubstances become cold, and when heat is absorbed by a body it becomes\r\nan expansive force at the expense of those around that contract, but it\r\nis not lost. In chemical action at a distance the principle of the\r\nconservation of force is maintained, for a chemical action may be\r\nproduced miles away from an electro-magnet, perfectly equivalent to the\r\ndominant chemical action in the battery. The two electricities are\r\ndeveloped in equal proportions, which may be combined so as to produce\r\nmany changes in their respective relations, yet the sum of the force of\r\none kind can never be made in the smallest degree either to exceed or to\r\ncome short of the sum of the other. Experimental research proves that\r\nthe conservation of force is an unalterable law of nature—“a principle\r\nin physics as large and sure as that of the indestructibility of matter\r\nor the invariability of gravity. No hypothesis should be admitted, nor\r\nany assertion of a fact credited, that denies this principle. No view\r\nshould be inconsistent or incompatible with it. Many of our hypotheses\r\nin the present state of science may not comprehend it, and may be unable\r\nto suggest its consequences, but none should oppose or contradict it.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus expressed his conviction of the truth of this great\r\nprinciple, Dr. Faraday considers the case of gravity, and concludes that\r\n“the definition of gravity as an attractive force between the particles\r\nof matter varying inversely as the square of the distance, while it\r\nstands as a full definition of the power, is inconsistent with the\r\nprinciple of the conservation of force.” For while in this definition\r\nthe principle is maintained of the constancy of the force _at the same\r\ndistance_, it implies a creation of force to an enormous amount when the\r\ndistance is diminished, and an equal amount annihilated when the\r\ndistance is increased,—“an effect,” he says, “which is equal in its\r\ninfinity and its consequences with creation, and only within the power\r\nof Him who creates.” He continues, “It will not be imagined for a moment\r\nthat I am opposed to what may be called the _law of gravitating action_,\r\nthat is, the law by which all the known effects of gravity are governed;\r\nwhat I am considering is the _definition_ of the _force_ of gravitation.\r\nThat the result of _one_ exercise of a power may be inversely as the\r\nsquare of the distance, I believe and admit; and I know that it is so in\r\nthe case of gravity, and has been verified to an extent that could\r\nhardly have been within the conception of Newton himself when he gave\r\nutterance to the law; but that the _totality_ of a force can be employed\r\naccording to that law I do not believe either in relation to\r\ngravitation, or electricity, or magnetism, or any other supposed form of\r\npower. That there should be a power of gravitation existing by itself,\r\nhaving no relation to the other natural powers, and no respect to the\r\nlaw of the conservation of force, is as little likely as that there\r\nshould be a principle of levity as well as gravity. Gravity may be only\r\nthe residual part of the other forces of nature, as Mossotti has tried\r\nto show; but that it should fall out from the law of all other forces,\r\nand should be outside the reach either of farther experiment or\r\nphilosophical conclusions, is not probable. So we must strive to learn\r\nmore of this outstanding power, and endeavour to avoid any definition of\r\nit which is incompatible with the principles of force generally, for all\r\nthe phenomena of nature lead us to believe that the great and governing\r\nlaw is one. Thus gravitation can only be considered as part of a more\r\ngeneral force whose law has yet to be discovered.”\r\n\r\nThe definition of the gravitating force immediately suggests the\r\nquestion of how it is transmitted; the full force of that question was\r\nfelt by Newton himself when, in his third letter to Bentley, he wrote,\r\n“That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so\r\nthat one body may act upon another at a distance, through a _vacuum_,\r\nwithout the mediation of anything else by and through which their action\r\nand force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an\r\nabsurdity that I believe no man who has in philosophic matters a\r\ncompetent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be\r\ncaused by an agent, acting constantly according to certain laws; but\r\nwhether this agent be material or immaterial I have left to the\r\nconsideration of my readers.”\r\n\r\nSince Newton’s time the continual decrease in the periodic times of the\r\ncomets belonging to our system, and the undulatory theory of light and\r\nheat, have proved the existence of an extremely rare elastic medium\r\nfilling space even to the most distant regions of which we are\r\ncognizant. But, rare as it may be, it has inertia enough to resist the\r\nmotion of comets, and therefore must be material, whether considered to\r\nbe ether or, according to Mr. Grove, the highly attenuated atmospheres\r\nof the celestial bodies. Professor William Thomson of Glasgow has\r\ncomputed that in the space traversed by the earth in its annual\r\nrevolution, a cube whose side is 1000 miles would contain not less than\r\na pound weight of the ethereal medium, and that the earth, in moving\r\nthrough it, would not displace the ·250th part of that pound of matter.\r\nYet that is enormously more dense than the continuation of the earth’s\r\natmosphere would be in interplanetary space, if rarefied according to\r\nBayle’s law. But whatever be the density or nature of the ether, there\r\nis every reason to believe that it is the medium which transmits the\r\ngravitating force from one celestial object to another, or possibly it\r\nmay possess a higher attribute with regard to gravity than its mere\r\ntransmission.\r\n\r\nDr. Faraday, who discovered the magnetism of the atmosphere, is led to\r\nbelieve that the ethereal medium too is magnetic by the following\r\nexperiment. Three solutions of the protosulphate of iron, _l_, _m_, _n_,\r\nthe first of which contained 4 grains of the salt dissolved in a cubic\r\ninch of water, the second 8 grains, and the third 16 grains—these were\r\nrespectively enclosed in three glass globules, all of which were\r\nattracted by the pole of a magnet. A quantity of the mean solution _m_\r\nwas then put into a vessel, and the globule containing the strongest\r\nsolution _n_ was immersed in it, which was attracted as before, but the\r\nglobule _l_, containing the weakest solution, was repelled when plunged\r\ninto the same liquid. Here there was a diamagnetic phenomenon, although\r\nthe glass globules and the liquid in which they were immersed contained\r\niron. The effect was evidently differential, for when the liquid was\r\nless attracted than the globule, the globule approached the pole, and\r\nwhen the liquid was more attracted than the globule, the latter appeared\r\nto recede from the pole. In fact, the effect is the same as that of\r\ngravity on a body immersed in water; if it be more forcibly attracted\r\nthan the water, it sinks; if less forcibly attracted, it rises, the\r\neffect being the same as if it were repelled by the earth. Hence the\r\nquestion, are all magnetic phenomena the result of a differential action\r\nof this kind, and is the ethereal medium less strongly attracted than\r\nsoft iron, and more strongly attracted than bismuth, thus permitting the\r\napproach of the iron, but causing the bismuth to recede from the pole of\r\na magnet? If such a medium exist, that is, if the ethereal medium be\r\nmagnetic, then diamagnetism is the same with paramagnetism, and the\r\npolarity of the magnetic force in iron and bismuth is one and the same.\r\n\r\nThe ethereal medium may be presumed to transmit the gravitating force;\r\nit transmits the magnetism of the solar spots, its undulations\r\nconstitute light, heat, and all the influences bound up in the solar\r\nbeam; and the most perfect vacuum we can make is capable of transmitting\r\nmechanical energy in enormous quantities, some of which differ but\r\nlittle from that of air or oxygen at an ordinary barometric pressure;\r\nand why not thus admit, says Mr. Thomson, the magnetic property, of\r\nwhich we know so little that we have no right to pronounce a negative?\r\n\r\nMr. Waterstone is also of opinion that it would be taking too narrow a\r\nview if we limited the function of the luminiferous ether to the\r\nconveying of physical pulses only. The atmosphere also conveys physical\r\npulses, but that is the least important of its functions in the economy\r\nof nature. There is nothing that should hinder us attributing to the\r\nmedia concerned in the radiation of light and heat the higher functions\r\nof electrical polarity and gravitation. The special dynamic arrangements\r\nby which this is effected may ever elude our research; but as there is\r\nno limit to the vis viva (N. 222) which such media may conserve in their\r\nminutest parts, so there is no physical impossibility in that vis viva\r\nbeing suddenly transferred to the molecules of ordinary matter in the\r\nproportion and sequence required to carry out the order and system of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle of action in such media must be in accordance\r\nwith _elastic impact_, for upon that the dynamic theory of heat and\r\nconservation of force rests as a foundation. The statical and dynamical\r\ncharacteristics of gravitation and transfusion of force conform to it,\r\nso that all the forces that hold the molecules of bodies together must\r\nalso be in subjection to it.[20]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION XXXV.\r\n\r\nEthereal Medium—Comets—Do not disturb the Solar System—Their Orbits and\r\n  Disturbances—M. Faye’s Comet probably the same with Lexel’s—Periods of\r\n  other three known—Acceleration in the mean Motions of Encke’s and\r\n  Biela’s Comets—The Shock of a Comet—Disturbing Action of the Earth and\r\n  Planets on Encke’s and Biela’s Comets—Velocity of Comets—The Comet of\r\n  1264—The great Comet of 1343—Physical Constitution—Shine by borrowed\r\n  Light—Estimation of their Number.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN considering the constitution of the earth, and the fluids which\r\nsurround it, various subjects have presented themselves to our notice,\r\nof which some, for aught we know, are confined to the planet we inhabit;\r\nsome are common to it and to the other bodies of our system. But an\r\nall-pervading ether must fill the whole visible creation, since it\r\nconveys, in the form of light, tremors which may have been excited in\r\nthe deepest recesses of the universe thousands of years before we were\r\ncalled into being. The existence of such a medium, though at first\r\nhypothetical, is proved by the undulatory theory of light, and rendered\r\ncertain by the motion of comets, and by its action upon the vapours of\r\nwhich they are chiefly composed. It has often been imagined that the\r\ntails of comets have infused new substances into our atmosphere.\r\nPossibly the earth may attract some of that nebulous matter, since the\r\nvapours raised by the sun’s heat, when the comets are in perihelio, and\r\nwhich form their tails, are scattered through space in their passage to\r\ntheir aphelion; but it has hitherto produced no effect, nor have the\r\nseasons ever been influenced by these bodies. The light of the comet of\r\nthe year 1811, which was so brilliant, did not impart any heat even when\r\ncondensed on the bulb of a thermometer of a structure so delicate that\r\nit would have made the hundredth part of a degree evident. In all\r\nprobability, the tails of comets may have passed over the earth without\r\nits inhabitants being conscious of their presence; and there is reason\r\nto believe that the tail of the great comet of 1843 did so. M. Valz\r\nobserved that the light of a brilliant comet was eclipsed as it passed\r\nover a star of the 7th magnitude, whence M. Babinet computed that the\r\nlight of the comet must have been sixty times less than that of the\r\nstar, and that matter so attenuated could not penetrate the earth’s\r\natmosphere, but the constitution of these bodies is still a matter of\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\nThe passage of comets has never sensibly disturbed the stability of the\r\nsolar system; their nucleus, being in general only a mass of vapour, is\r\nso rare, and their transit so rapid, even when they had a solid part,\r\nthat the time has not been long enough to admit of a sufficient\r\naccumulation of impetus to produce a perceptible action. Indeed, M.\r\nDusejour has shown that, under the most favourable circumstances, a\r\ncomet cannot remain longer than two hours and a half at a less distance\r\nfrom the earth than 10,500 leagues. The comet of 1770 passed within\r\nabout six times the distance of the moon from the earth, without even\r\naffecting our tides. According to La Place, the action of the earth on\r\nthe comet of 1770 augmented the period of its revolution by more than\r\ntwo days; and, if comets had any perceptible disturbing energy, the\r\nreaction of the comet ought to have increased the length of our year.\r\nHad the mass of that comet been equal to the mass of the earth, its\r\ndisturbing action would have increased the length of the sidereal year\r\nby 2^h 53^m; but, as Delambre’s computations from the Greenwich\r\nobservations of the sun show that the length of the year has not been\r\nincreased by the fraction of a second, its mass could not have been\r\nequal to the 1/5000th part of that of the earth. This accounts for the\r\nsame comet having twice swept through the system of Jupiter’s satellites\r\nwithout deranging the motion of these moons. M. Dusejour has computed\r\nthat a comet, equal in mass to the earth, passing at the distance of\r\n12,150 leagues from our planet, would increase the length of the year to\r\n367^d 16^h 5^m, and the obliquity of the ecliptic as much as 2°. So\r\nthe principal action of comets would be to alter the calendar, even if\r\nthey were dense enough to affect the earth.\r\n\r\nComets traverse all parts of the heavens; their paths have every\r\npossible inclination to the plane of the ecliptic, and, unlike the\r\nplanets, the motion of more than half of those that have appeared has\r\nbeen retrograde, that is, from east to west. They are only visible when\r\nnear their perihelia; then their velocity is such, that its square is\r\ntwice as great as that of a body moving in a circle at the same\r\ndistance: they consequently remain but a very short time within the\r\nplanetary orbits. And, as all the conic sections of the same focal\r\ndistance sensibly coincide, through a small arc, on each side of the\r\nextremity of their axis, it is difficult to ascertain in which of these\r\ncurves the comets move, from observations made, as they necessarily must\r\nbe, near their perihelia (N. 227). Probably they all move in extremely\r\nexcentric ellipses; although, in most cases, the parabolic curve\r\ncoincides most nearly with their observed motions. Some few seem to\r\ndescribe hyperbolas; such, being once visible to us, would vanish for\r\never, to wander through boundless space, to the remote systems of the\r\nuniverse. If a planet be supposed to revolve in a circular orbit, whose\r\nradius is equal to the perihelion distance of a comet moving in a\r\nparabola, the areas described by these two bodies in the same time will\r\nbe as unity to the square root of two, which forms such a connexion\r\nbetween the motion of comets and planets, that, by Kepler’s law, the\r\nratio of the areas described during the same time by the comet and the\r\nearth may be found; so that the place of a comet may be computed at any\r\ntime in its parabolic orbit, estimated from the instant of its passage\r\nat the perihelion. It is a problem of very great difficulty to determine\r\nall the other elements of parabolic motion—namely, the comet’s\r\nperihelion distance, or shortest distance from the sun, estimated in\r\nparts of the mean distance of the earth from the sun; the longitude of\r\nthe perihelion; the inclination of the orbit on the plane of the\r\necliptic; and the longitude of the ascending node. Three observed\r\nlongitudes and latitudes of a comet are sufficient for computing the\r\napproximate values of these quantities; but an accurate estimation of\r\nthem can only be obtained by successive corrections, from a number of\r\nobservations, distant from one another. When the motion of a comet is\r\nretrograde, the place of the ascending node is exactly opposite to what\r\nit is when the motion is direct. Hence the place of the ascending node,\r\ntogether with the direction of the comet’s motion, show whether the\r\ninclination of the orbit is on the north or south side of the plane of\r\nthe ecliptic. If the motion be direct, the inclination is on the north\r\nside; if retrograde, it is on the south side.\r\n\r\nThe identity of the elements is the only proof of the return of a comet\r\nto our system. Should the elements of a new comet be the same, or nearly\r\nthe same, with those of any one previously known, the probability of the\r\nidentity of the two bodies is very great, since the similarity extends\r\nto no less than four elements, every one of which is capable of an\r\ninfinity of variations. But, even if the orbit be determined with all\r\nthe accuracy the case admits of, it may be difficult, or even\r\nimpossible, to recognize a comet on its return, because its orbit would\r\nbe very much changed if it passed near any of the large planets of this\r\nor of any other system, in consequence of their disturbing energy, which\r\nwould be very great on bodies of so rare a nature.\r\n\r\nBy far the most curious and interesting instance of the disturbing\r\naction of the great bodies of our system is found in the comet of 1770.\r\nThe elements of its orbit, determined by Messier, did not agree with\r\nthose of any comet that had hitherto been computed, yet Lexel\r\nascertained that it described an ellipse about the sun, whose major axis\r\nwas only equal to three times the length of the diameter of the\r\nterrestrial orbit, and consequently that it must return to the sun at\r\nintervals of five years and a half. This result was confirmed by\r\nnumerous observations, as the comet was visible through an arc of 170°;\r\nyet this comet had never been observed before the year 1770, nor has it\r\never again been seen till 1843, though very brilliant. The disturbing\r\naction of the larger planets affords a solution of this anomaly, as\r\nLexel ascertained that in 1767 the comet must have passed Jupiter at a\r\ndistance less than the fifty-eighth part of its distance from the sun,\r\nand that in 1779 it would be 500 times nearer Jupiter than the sun;\r\nconsequently the action of the sun on the comet would not be the\r\nfiftieth part of what it would experience from Jupiter, so that Jupiter\r\nbecame the primum mobile. Assuming the orbit to be such as Lexel had\r\ndetermined in 1770, La Place found that the action of Jupiter, previous\r\nto the year 1770, had so completely changed the form of it, that the\r\ncomet which had been invisible to us before 1770 was then brought into\r\nview, and that the action of the same planet, producing a contrary\r\neffect, has subsequently to that year removed it from our sight, since\r\nit was computed to be revolving in an orbit whose perihelion was beyond\r\nthe orbit of Ceres. However, the action of Jupiter during the summer of\r\n1840 must have been so great, from his proximity to that singular body,\r\nthat he seems to have brought it back to its former path as he had done\r\nin 1767, for the elements of the orbit of a comet which was discovered\r\nin November 1843, by M. Faye, agree so nearly with those of the orbit of\r\nLexel’s comet that the two bodies were supposed to be identical; by the\r\nsubsequent computation of M. le Verrier, it appears, however, that they\r\nare not the same, that they were both brought to our system by Jupiter’s\r\nattraction, and that they have been in it more than a century, and have\r\nfrequently come near the earth without having been seen. From the\r\nsmallness of the excentricity of Lexel’s comet, the orbit resembles\r\nthose of the planets, but this comet is liable to greater perturbations\r\nthan any other body in the system, because it comes very near the orbit\r\nof Mars when in perihelion, and very near that of Jupiter when in\r\naphelion; besides, it passes within a comparatively small distance of\r\nthe orbits of the minor planets; and as it will continue to cross the\r\norbit of Jupiter at each revolution till the two bodies meet, its\r\nperiodic time, now about seven years, will again be changed, but in the\r\nmean time it ought to have returned to its perihelion in the year 1851.\r\nThis comet might have been seen from the earth in 1776, had its light\r\nnot been eclipsed by that of the sun. There is still so much doubt with\r\nregard to Lexel’s comet that during the present year, 1858, M. le\r\nVerrier has constructed a table of all the orbits in which the comet may\r\nhave moved after leaving Jupiter in 1770, which will enable astronomers\r\nto recognise the comet even should the elements of its orbit be much\r\naltered. He thinks it possible that its path may have become hyperbolic,\r\nbut that it is more likely an augmentation of its periodic time may have\r\ntaken place. It is quite possible that comets frequenting our system may\r\nbe turned away, or others brought to the sun, by the attraction of\r\nplanets revolving beyond the orbit of Neptune, or by bodies still\r\nfarther removed from the solar influence.\r\n\r\nOther comets, liable to less disturbance, return to the sun at stated\r\nintervals. Halley computed the elements of the orbit of a comet that\r\nappeared in the year 1682, which agreed so nearly with those of the\r\ncomets of 1607 and 1531, that he concluded it to be the same body\r\nreturning to the sun at intervals of about seventy-five years. He\r\nconsequently predicted its reappearance in the year 1758, or in the\r\nbeginning of 1759. Science was not sufficiently advanced in the time of\r\nHalley to enable him to determine the perturbations this comet might\r\nexperience; but Clairaut computed that, in consequence of the attraction\r\nof Jupiter and Saturn, its periodic time would be so much shorter than\r\nduring its revolution between 1607 and 1682, that it would pass its\r\nperihelion on the 18th of April, 1759. The comet did arrive at that\r\npoint of its orbit on the 12th of March, which was thirty-seven days\r\nbefore the time assigned. Clairaut subsequently reduced the error to\r\ntwenty-three days; and La Place has since shown that it would only have\r\nbeen thirteen days if the mass of Saturn had been as well known as it is\r\nnow. It appears, from this, that the path of the comet was not quite\r\nknown at that period; and, although many observations were then made,\r\nthey were far from attaining the accuracy of those of the present day.\r\nBesides, since the year 1759, the orbit of the comet has been altered by\r\nthe attraction of Jupiter in one direction, and that of Saturn, Uranus,\r\nand Neptune in the other; yet, notwithstanding these sources of\r\nuncertainty, and our ignorance of all the possible causes of derangement\r\nfrom unknown bodies on the confines of our system, or in the regions\r\nbeyond it, the comet appeared exactly at the time, and not far from the\r\nplace assigned to it by astronomers; and its actual arrival at its\r\nperihelion a little before noon on the 16th of November, 1835, only\r\ndiffered from the computed time by a very few days, which was probably\r\nowing to the attraction of Neptune.\r\n\r\nThe fulfilment of this astronomical prediction is truly wonderful, if it\r\nbe considered that the comet is seen only for a few weeks during its\r\npassage through our system, and that it wanders from the sun for\r\nseventy-five years to twice the distance of Uranus. This enormous orbit\r\nis four times longer than it is broad; its length is about 3420 millions\r\nof miles, or about thirty-six times the mean distance of the earth from\r\nthe sun. At its perihelion the comet comes within nearly fifty-seven\r\nmillions of miles of the sun, and at its aphelion it is sixty times more\r\ndistant. On account of this extensive range it must experience 3600\r\ntimes more light and heat when nearest to the sun than in the most\r\nremote point of its orbit. In the one position the sun will seem to be\r\nfour times larger than he appears to us, and at the other he will not be\r\napparently larger than a star (N. 228.)\r\n\r\nOn the first appearance of Halley’s comet, early in August 1835, it\r\nseemed to be merely a globular mass of dim vapour, without a tail. A\r\nconcentration of light, a little on one side of the centre, increased as\r\nthe comet approached the sun and earth, and latterly looked so like the\r\ndisc of a small planet, that it might have been mistaken for a solid\r\nnucleus. M. Struve, however, saw a central occultation of a star of the\r\nninth magnitude by the comet, at Dorpat, on the 29th of September. The\r\nstar remained constantly visible, without any considerable diminution of\r\nlight; and, instead of being eclipsed, the nucleus of the comet\r\ndisappeared at the moment of conjunction from the brilliancy of the\r\nstar. The tail increased as the comet approached its perihelion, and\r\nshortly before it was lost in the sun’s rays it was between thirty and\r\nforty degrees in length.\r\n\r\nAccording to the observations of M. Valz, the nebulosity increased in\r\nmagnitude as it approached the sun; but no other comet on record has\r\nexhibited such sudden and unaccountable changes of aspect. It was\r\ninvisible for two months when near its perihelion passage, and when it\r\nreappeared on the 24th of January, 1836, its aspect was completely\r\nchanged; it had no tail, and to the naked eye was like a hazy star; but\r\nwith a powerful telescope it presented a small, round, planetary-looking\r\nnucleus 2ʺ in diameter, surrounded by an extensive coma, and in the\r\ncentre it had a small, bright, solid part. The nucleus, clear and well\r\ndefined, like the disc of a planet, was observed on one occasion to\r\nbecome obscure and enlarged in the course of a few hours. But by far the\r\nmost remarkable circumstance was the sudden appearance of certain\r\nluminous brushes or sectors, diverging from the centre of the nucleus\r\nthrough the nebulosity. M. Struve describes the nucleus of the comet, in\r\nthe beginning of October, as elliptical, and like a burning coal, out of\r\nwhich there issued, in a direction nearly opposite to the tail, a\r\ndivergent flame, varying in intensity, form, and direction, appearing\r\noccasionally even double, and suggesting the idea of luminous gas\r\nbursting from the nucleus. On one occasion M. Arago saw three of these\r\ndivergent flames on the side opposite the tail, rising through the\r\nnebulosity, which they greatly exceeded in brilliancy: after the comet\r\nhad passed its perihelion, it acquired another of these luminous fans,\r\nwhich was observed by Sir John Herschel at the Cape of Good Hope.\r\nHevelius describes an appearance precisely similar, which he had\r\nwitnessed in this comet at its approach to the sun in the year 1682, and\r\nsomething of the kind seems to have been noticed in the comet of 1744.\r\nPossibly the second tail of the comet of 1724, which was directed\r\ntowards the sun, may have been of this nature.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the ethereal medium on the motions of Halley’s comet\r\nwill be known after another revolution, and future astronomers will\r\nlearn, by the accuracy of its returns, whether it has met with any\r\nunknown cause of disturbance in its distant journey. Undiscovered\r\nplanets, beyond the visible boundary of our system, may change its path\r\nand the period of its revolution, and thus may indirectly reveal to us\r\ntheir existence, and even their physical nature and orbit. The secrets\r\nof the yet more distant heavens may be disclosed to future generations\r\nby comets which penetrate still farther into space, such as that of\r\n1763, which, if any faith may be placed in the computation, goes nearly\r\nforty-three times farther from the sun than Halley’s does, and shows\r\nthat the sun’s attraction is powerful enough, at the enormous distance\r\nof 15,500 millions of miles, to recall the comet to its perihelion. The\r\nperiods of some comets are said to be of many thousand years, and even\r\nthe average time of the revolution of comets generally is about a\r\nthousand years; which proves that the sun’s gravitating force extends\r\nvery far. La Place estimates that the solar attraction is felt\r\nthroughout a sphere whose radius is a hundred millions of times greater\r\nthan the distance of the earth from the sun.\r\n\r\nAuthentic records of Halley’s comet do not extend beyond the year 1456,\r\nyet it may be traced, with some degree of probability, even to a period\r\npreceding the Christian era. But as the evidence only rests upon\r\ncoincidences of its periodic time, which may vary as much as eighteen\r\nmonths from the disturbing action of the planets, its identity with\r\ncomets of such remote times must be regarded as extremely doubtful.\r\n\r\nThis is the first comet whose periodicity has been established. It is\r\nalso the first whose elements have been determined from observations\r\nmade in Europe; for, although the comets which appeared in the years\r\n240, 539, 565, and 837, are the most ancient of those whose orbits have\r\nbeen traced, their elements were computed from Chinese observations.\r\n\r\nBesides Halley’s and Lexel’s comets, ten or twelve others are now known\r\nto form part of the solar system; that is to say, they return to the sun\r\nat stated periods. Six of them have periods of less than eight years.\r\nThat generally called Encke’s comet, or the comet of the short period,\r\nwas first seen by MM. Messier and Mechain in 1786, again by Miss\r\nHerschel in 1805, and its returns, in the years 1805 and 1819, were\r\nobserved by other astronomers, under the impression that all four were\r\ndifferent bodies. However, Professor Encke not only proved their\r\nidentity, but determined the circumstances of the comet’s motion. Its\r\nreappearance in the years 1825, 1828, and 1832, accorded with the orbit\r\nassigned by M. Encke, who thus established the length of its period to\r\nbe 1204 days, nearly. This comet is very small, of feeble light, and\r\ninvisible to the naked eye, except under very favourable circumstances,\r\nand in particular positions. It has no tail, it revolves in an ellipse\r\nof great excentricity inclined at an angle of 13° 22ʹ to the plane of\r\nthe ecliptic, and is subject to considerable perturbations from the\r\nattraction of the planets, which occasion variations in its periodic\r\ntime. Among the many perturbations to which the planets are liable,\r\ntheir mean motions, and therefore the major axes of their orbits,\r\nexperience no change; while, on the contrary, the mean motion of the\r\nmoon is accelerated from age to age—a circumstance at first attributed\r\nto the resistance of an ethereal medium pervading space, but\r\nsubsequently proved to arise from the secular diminution of the\r\nexcentricity of the terrestrial orbit. Although the resistance of such a\r\nmedium has not hitherto been perceived in the motions of such dense\r\nbodies as the planets and satellites, its effects on the revolutions of\r\nthe comets leave no doubt of its existence. From the numerous\r\nobservations that have been made on each return of the comet of the\r\nshort period, the elements have been computed with great accuracy on the\r\nhypothesis of its moving in vacuo. Its perturbations occasioned by the\r\ndisturbing action of the planets have been determined; and, after\r\neverything that could influence its motion had been duly considered, M.\r\nEncke found that an acceleration of about two days in each revolution\r\nhas taken place in its mean motion, precisely similar to that which\r\nwould be occasioned by the resistance of an ethereal medium. And, as it\r\ncannot be attributed to a cause like that which produces the\r\nacceleration of the moon, it must be concluded that the celestial bodies\r\ndo not perform their revolutions in an absolute void, and that, although\r\nthe medium be too rare to have a sensible effect on the masses of the\r\nplanets and satellites, it nevertheless has a considerable influence on\r\nso rare a body as a comet. Contradictory as it may seem that the motion\r\nof a body should be accelerated by the resistance of an ethereal medium,\r\nthe truth becomes evident if it be considered that both planets and\r\ncomets are retained in their orbits by two forces which exactly balance\r\none another; namely, the centrifugal force producing the velocity in the\r\ntangent, and the attraction of the gravitating force directed to the\r\ncentre of the sun. If one of these forces be diminished by any cause,\r\nthe other will be proportionally increased. Now, the necessary effect of\r\na resisting medium is to diminish the tangential velocity, so that the\r\nbalance is destroyed, gravity preponderates, the body descends towards\r\nthe sun till equilibrium is again restored between the two forces; and,\r\nas it then describes a smaller orbit, it moves with increased velocity.\r\nThus, the resistance of an ethereal medium actually accelerates the\r\nmotion of a body; but, as the resisting force is confined to the plane\r\nof the orbit, it has no influence whatever on the inclination of the\r\norbit, or on the place of the nodes. In computing its effect, M. Encke\r\nassumed the increase to be inversely as the square of the distance, and\r\nthat its resistance acts as a tangential force proportional to the\r\nsquares of the comet’s actual velocity in each point of its orbit.\r\nAnother comet belonging to our system, which returns to its perihelion\r\nafter a period of 6-3/4 years, has been accelerated in its motion by a\r\nwhole day during one revolution, which puts the existence of ether\r\nbeyond a doubt, and confirms the undulatory theory of light. Since this\r\ncomet, which revolves nearly between the orbits of the earth and\r\nJupiter, is only accelerated one day at each revolution, while Encke’s,\r\nrevolving nearly between the orbits of Mercury and Pallas, is\r\naccelerated two, the ethereal medium must increase in density towards\r\nthe sun. The comet in question was discovered by M. Biela at Josephstadt\r\non the 27th of February, 1826, and ten days afterwards it was seen by M.\r\nGambart at Marseilles, who computed its parabolic elements, and found\r\nthat they agreed with those of the comets which had appeared in the\r\nyears 1789 and 1795, whence he concluded them to be the same body moving\r\nin an ellipse, and accomplishing its revolution in 2460 days. The\r\nperturbations of this comet were computed by M. Damoiseau, who predicted\r\nthat it would cross the plane of the ecliptic on the 29th of October,\r\n1832, a little before midnight, at a point nearly 18,484 miles within\r\nthe earth’s orbit; and as M. Olbers of Bremen, in 1805, had determined\r\nthe radius of the comet’s head to be about 21,136 miles, it was evident\r\nthat its nebulosity would envelop a portion of the earth’s orbit,—a\r\ncircumstance which caused some alarm in France, from the notion that, if\r\nany disturbing cause had delayed the arrival of the comet for one month,\r\nthe earth must have passed through its head. M. Arago dispelled these\r\nfears by his excellent treatise on comets, in the Annuaire of 1832,\r\nwhere he proves that, as the earth would never be nearer the comet than\r\n18,000,000 British leagues, there could be no danger of collision. The\r\nearth is in more danger from these two small comets than from any other.\r\nEncke’s crosses the terrestrial orbit sixty times in a century, and may\r\nultimately come into collision, but both are so extremely rare, that\r\nlittle injury is to be apprehended.\r\n\r\nThe earth would fall to the sun in 64-1/2 days, if it were struck by a\r\ncomet with sufficient impetus to destroy its centrifugal force. What the\r\nearth’s primitive velocity may have been it is impossible to say.\r\nTherefore a comet may have given it a shock without changing the axis of\r\nrotation, but only destroying part of its tangential velocity, so as to\r\ndiminish the size of the orbit—a thing by no means impossible, though\r\nhighly improbable. At all events, there is no proof of this having\r\noccurred; and it is manifest that the axis of the earth’s rotation has\r\nnot been changed, because, as the ether offers no sensible resistance to\r\nso dense a body as the earth, the libration would to this day be evident\r\nin the variation it must have occasioned in the terrestrial latitudes.\r\nSupposing the nucleus of a comet to have a diameter only equal to the\r\nfourth part of that of the earth, and that its perihelion is nearer to\r\nthe sun than we are ourselves, its orbit being otherwise unknown, M.\r\nArago has computed that the probability of the earth receiving a shock\r\nfrom it is only one in 281 millions, and that the chance of our coming\r\nin contact with its nebulosity is about ten or twelve times greater.\r\nOnly comets with retrograde motions can come into direct collision with\r\nthe earth, and if the momentum were great the event might be fatal; but\r\nin general the substance of comets is so rare, that it is likely they\r\nwould not do much harm if they were to impinge; and even then the\r\nmischief would probably be local, and the equilibrium soon restored,\r\nprovided the nucleus were gaseous, or very small. It is, however, more\r\nprobable that the earth would only be deflected a little from its course\r\nby the approach of a comet, without being touched by it. The comets that\r\nhave come nearest to the earth were that of the year 837, which remained\r\nfour days within less than 1,240,000 leagues from our orbit: that of\r\n1770, which approached within about six times the distance of the moon.\r\nThe celebrated comet of 1680 also came very near to us; and the comet\r\nwhose period is 6-3/4 years was ten times nearer the earth in 1805 than\r\nin 1832, when it caused so much alarm.\r\n\r\nEncke’s and Biela’s comets are at present far removed from the influence\r\nof Jupiter, but they will not always remain so, because, the aphelia and\r\nnodes of the orbits of these two comets being the points which approach\r\nnearest to the orbit of Jupiter at each meeting of the planet and\r\ncomets, the major axis of Encke’s comet will be increased and that of\r\nBiela’s diminished, till in the course of time, when the proximity has\r\nincreased sufficiently, the orbits will be completely changed, as that\r\nof Lexel’s was in 1770. Every twenty-third year, or after seven\r\nrevolutions of Encke’s comet, its greatest proximity to Jupiter takes\r\nplace, and at that time his attraction increases the period of its\r\nrevolution by nine days—a circumstance which took place in the end of\r\nthe years 1820 and 1843. But from the position of the bodies there is a\r\ndiminution of three days in the six following revolutions, which reduces\r\nthe increase to six days in seven revolutions. Thus, before the year\r\n1819, the periodic time of Encke’s comet was 1204 days, and it was 1219\r\ndays in accomplishing the revolution that ended in 1845. By this\r\nprogressive increase the orbit of the comet will reach that of Jupiter\r\nin seven or eight centuries, and then by the very near approach of the\r\ntwo bodies it will be completely changed.\r\n\r\nAt present the Earth and Mercury have the most powerful influence on the\r\nmotions of Encke’s and Biela’s comets; and have had for so long a time\r\nthat, according to the computation of Mr. Airy, the present orbit of the\r\nlatter was formed by the attraction of the Earth, and that of Encke’s by\r\nthe action of Mercury. With regard to the latter comet, that event must\r\nhave taken place in February 1776. In 1786 Encke’s comet had both a tail\r\nand a nucleus, now it has neither; a singular instance of the\r\npossibility of their disappearance. It was in perihelio in 1855.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 Biela’s comet was divided into two distinct bodies, by what\r\nstrange accident is altogether a mystery. The nuclei of the two comets\r\nwere separated by about 150,000 miles, and they travelled together with\r\ntheir tails parallel, and an arch of light over their heads. Till that\r\ntime Biela’s comet never had been seen with a tail. The new head was\r\ndull at first, but increased in size and brightness till it surpassed\r\nits companion in both; besides, it had a bright flashing diamond-like\r\npoint in its centre—gradually it resumed its dull appearance, and its\r\nperiod was computed to be eight days longer than that of the original\r\nhead. They had separated to a greater distance from one another in 1853,\r\nbut were still travelling together, one having become smaller than the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nA comet discovered by M. Brorsen of Kiel, on the 26th of February, 1846,\r\ncame, on the 20th of April following, nearly as close to Jupiter as his\r\nfourth satellite, when Jupiter’s attraction must have been ten times\r\ngreater than that of the sun; so there is every reason to believe that\r\nthe comet’s orbit will be as much altered as that of Lexel’s; and\r\nanother discovered by Padre de Vico at Rome, on the 22nd of August,\r\nwill, in all probability, be as much disturbed by the same cause. One of\r\nthe comets found by that astronomer has a period which varies, according\r\nto different computations, from 55 to 99 years; it certainly has an\r\nelliptical orbit. That discovered at Naples by Mr. Peters revolves about\r\nthe sun in 16 years; but Olbers’s comet of 1815 must go nearly the same\r\ndistance into space with Halley’s, since its period is 74 years. Two\r\ndiscovered by M. Brorsen have periods, one of 500 and the other of 28\r\nyears; but of the latter there is some uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe comet which appeared in 1596 and 1845 has a period of 249 years; and\r\nshould M. Argelander’s computation be accurate, the orbit which has\r\nhitherto been assigned to the great comet of 1811 must be erroneous,\r\nsince he has ascertained its period to be 3066 years.\r\n\r\nThe great comet of 1264, which had a tail that extended over 100° of the\r\ncelestial vault, was observed and recorded by the Chinese, and was\r\nascertained to be the same that had appeared in 1556, and of whose\r\nmotions observations were taken at Vienna in the reign of the Emperor\r\nCharles V., but it was then less brilliant. In consequence of the\r\ndiscovery of the original observations of the comet of 1556, by\r\nFabricius at Vienna, and by Heller at Nuremburg, Mr. Hind was induced to\r\ncompute its orbit for that year; but after much labour, aided by all the\r\nimproved methods of calculation, he found Heller’s observations so\r\nconfused, and even erroneous, that he could not determine the curve\r\ndescribed by the comet at that time with any precision, and therefore\r\ncould only predict that the epoch of its return would be some time\r\nbetween 1848 and 1861. Before comets reach the sun they are rarely\r\nconspicuous; but if after passing their perihelion they come near the\r\nearth, then they have tails, and become brilliant in consequence of the\r\nsun’s action upon the matter of which they are formed. Now if the comet\r\nin question should pass its perihelion between the months of March and\r\nOctober, it possibly may be as remarkable as ever; but should it come\r\nnearest to the sun in winter, such is the position of its orbit with\r\nregard to the earth, that it may pass unnoticed—which is very unlikely,\r\nas search is being made for it at almost all the observatories in Europe\r\nand in the United States. Nearly the whole of its orbit lies below the\r\nplane of the ecliptic, and far from the paths of the larger planets, but\r\nit extends into space more than twice the distance of Neptune, or nearly\r\nsix thousand millions of miles from the sun.\r\n\r\nComets in or near their perihelion move with prodigious velocity. That\r\nof 1680 appears to have gone half round the sun in ten hours and a half,\r\nmoving at the rate of 880,000 miles an hour. If its enormous centrifugal\r\nforce had ceased when passing its perihelion, it would have fallen to\r\nthe sun in about three minutes, as it was then less than 147,000 miles\r\nfrom his surface. So near the sun, it would be exposed to a heat 27,500\r\ntimes greater than that received by the earth; and as the sun’s heat is\r\nsupposed to be in proportion to the intensity of his light, it is\r\nprobable that a degree of heat so intense would be sufficient to convert\r\ninto vapour every terrestrial substance with which we are acquainted. At\r\nthe perihelion distance the sun’s diameter would be seen from the comet\r\nunder an angle of 73°, so that the sun, viewed from the comet, would\r\nnearly cover the whole extent of the heavens from the horizon to the\r\nzenith. As this comet is presumed to have a period of 575 years, the\r\nmajor axis of its orbit must be so great, that at the aphelion the sun’s\r\ndiameter would only subtend an angle of about fourteen seconds, which is\r\nnot so great by half as the diameter of Mars appears to us when in\r\nopposition. The sun would consequently impart no heat, so that the comet\r\nwould then be exposed to the temperature of the ethereal regions, which\r\nis 239° below the zero point of Fahrenheit. A body of such tenuity as\r\nthe comet, moving with such velocity, must have met with great\r\nresistance from the dense atmosphere of the sun, while passing so near\r\nhis surface at its perihelion. The centrifugal force must consequently\r\nhave been diminished, and the sun’s attraction proportionally augmented,\r\nso that it must have come nearer to the sun in 1680 than in its\r\npreceding revolution, and would subsequently describe a smaller orbit.\r\nAs this diminution of its orbit will be repeated at each revolution, the\r\ncomet will infallibly end by falling on the surface of the sun, unless\r\nits course be changed by the disturbing influence of some large body in\r\nthe unknown expanse of creation. Our ignorance of the actual density of\r\nthe sun’s atmosphere, of the density of the comet, and of the period of\r\nits revolution, renders it impossible to form any idea of the number of\r\ncenturies which must elapse before this event takes place.\r\n\r\nThe same cause may affect the motions of the planets, and ultimately be\r\nthe means of destroying the solar system. But, as Sir John Herschel\r\nobserves, they could hardly all revolve in the same direction round the\r\nsun for so many ages without impressing a corresponding motion on the\r\nethereal medium, which may preserve them from the accumulated effects of\r\nits resistance. Should this material medium revolve about the sun like a\r\nvortex, it will accelerate the revolutions of such comets as have direct\r\nmotions, and retard those that have retrograde motions.\r\n\r\nThe comet which appeared unexpectedly in the beginning of the year 1843\r\nwas one of the most splendid that ever visited the solar system. It was\r\nin the constellation of Antinous in the end of January, at a distance of\r\n115 millions of miles from the earth, and it passed through its\r\nperihelion on the 27th of February, when it was lost in the sun’s rays;\r\nbut it began to be visible about the 3rd of March, at which time it was\r\nnear the star Iota Cetæ, and its tail extended towards the Hare. Before\r\nthe passage at the perihelion it had no tail; but at that epoch the tail\r\nsuddenly darted out, and extended to a distance of 1826 millions of\r\nmiles in about an hour and a half—a most inexplicable speed of\r\ndevelopment, which indicates some powerful repulsive force at the moment\r\nof the greatest proximity to the sun, at which time the tails are\r\nformed. The brightness of the comet and the length of its tail continued\r\nto increase till the latter stretched far beyond the constellation of\r\nthe Hare towards a point above Sirius. Stars were distinctly seen\r\nthrough it, and when near perihelion the comet was so bright that it was\r\nseen in clear sunshine, in the United States, like a white cloud. The\r\nmotion was retrograde, and on leaving the solar system it retreated so\r\nrapidly at once from the sun and earth that it was soon lost sight of\r\nfor want of light. On the 1st of April it was between the sun and the\r\nearth, and only 40 millions of miles from the latter; and as its tail\r\nwas at least 60 millions of miles long, and 20 millions of miles broad,\r\nwe probably passed through it without being aware of it. There is some\r\ndiscrepancy in the different computations of the elements of the orbit,\r\nbut in the greater number of cases the perihelion distance was found to\r\nbe less than the semidiameter of the sun, so that the comet must have\r\ngrazed his surface, if it did not actually impinge obliquely on him.\r\n\r\nThe perihelion distance of this comet differs little from that of the\r\ngreat comet of 1668, which came so near the sun. The motion of both was\r\nretrograde, and a certain resemblance in the two orbits makes it\r\nprobable that they are the same body performing a revolution in 175\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThough already so well acquainted with the motions of comets, we know\r\nnothing of their physical constitution. A vast number, especially of\r\ntelescopic comets, are only like clouds or masses of vapour, often\r\nwithout tails. The head commonly consists of a concentrated mass of\r\nlight, like a planet, surrounded by a very transparent atmosphere, and\r\nthe whole, viewed with a telescope, is so diaphanous, that the smallest\r\nstar may be seen even through the densest part of the nucleus; in\r\ngeneral their solid parts, when they have any, are so minute, that they\r\nhave no sensible diameter, like that of the comet of 1811, which\r\nappeared to Sir William Herschel like a luminous point in the middle of\r\nthe nebulous matter. The nuclei, which seem to be formed of the denser\r\nstrata of that nebulous matter in successive coatings, are sometimes of\r\ngreat magnitude. Those comets which came to the sun in the years 1799\r\nand 1807 had nuclei whose diameters measured 180 and 275 leagues\r\nrespectively, and the second comet of 1811 had a nucleus 1350 leagues in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be stated that, as comets are generally at prodigious\r\ndistances from the earth, the solid parts of the nuclei appear like mere\r\npoints of light, so minute that it is impossible to measure them with\r\nany kind of accuracy, so that the best astronomers often differ in the\r\nestimation of their size by one-half of the whole diameter. The transit\r\nof a comet across the sun would afford the best information with regard\r\nto the nature of the nuclei. It was computed that such an event was to\r\ntake place in the year 1827; unfortunately the sun was hid by clouds\r\nfrom the British astronomers, but it was examined at Viviers and at\r\nMarseilles at the time the comet must have been projected on its disc,\r\nbut no spot or cloud was to be seen, so that it must have had no solid\r\npart whatever. The nuclei of many comets which seemed solid and\r\nbrilliant to the naked eye have been resolved into mere vapour by\r\ntelescopes of high powers; in Halley’s comet there was no solid part at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe nebulosity immediately round the nucleus is so diaphanous, that it\r\ngives little light; but at a small distance the nebulous matter becomes\r\nsuddenly brilliant, so as to look like a bright ring round the body.\r\nSometimes there are two or three of these luminous concentric rings\r\nseparated by dark intervals, but they are generally incomplete on the\r\npart next the tail.\r\n\r\nThese annular appearances are an optical effect, arising from a\r\nsuccession of envelopes of the nebulous matter with intervals between\r\nthem, of which the first is sometimes in contact with the nucleus and\r\nsometimes not. The thickness of these bright diaphanous coatings in the\r\ncomets of 1799 and 1807 was about 7000 and 10,000 leagues respectively;\r\nand in the first comet of 1811 the luminous ring was 8000 leagues thick,\r\nand the distance between its interior surface and the centre of the head\r\nwas 10,000 leagues. The latter comet was by much the most brilliant that\r\nhas been seen in modern times; it was first discovered in this country\r\nby Mr. James Vietch of Inchbonny, and was observed in all its changes by\r\nSir William Herschel and M. Olbers. To the naked eye, the head had the\r\nappearance of an ill-defined round mass of light, which was resolved\r\ninto several distinct parts when viewed with a telescope. A very\r\nbrilliant interior circular mass of nebulous matter was surrounded by a\r\nblack space having a parabolic form, very distinct from the dark blue of\r\nthe sky. This dark space was of a very appreciable breadth. Exterior to\r\nthe black interval there was a luminous parabolic contour of\r\nconsiderable thickness, which was prolonged on each side in two\r\ndiverging branches, which formed the bifid tail of the comet. Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel found that the brilliant interior circular mass lost\r\nthe distinctness of its outline as he increased the magnifying power of\r\nthe telescope, and presented the appearance of a more and more diffuse\r\nmass of greenish or blueish green light, whose intensity decreased\r\ngradually, not from the centre, but from an eccentric brilliant speck,\r\nsupposed to be the truly solid part of the comet. The luminous envelope\r\nwas of a decided yellow, which contrasted strongly with the greenish\r\ntint of the interior nebulous mass. Stars were nearly veiled by the\r\nluminous envelope, whilst, on the contrary, Sir William Herschel saw\r\nthree extremely small stars shining clearly in the black space, which\r\nwas singularly transparent. As the envelopes were formed in succession\r\nas the comet approached the sun, Sir William Herschel conceived them to\r\nbe vapours raised by his heat at the surface of the nucleus, and\r\nsuspended round it like a vault or dome by the elastic force of an\r\nextensive and highly transparent atmosphere. In coming to the sun, the\r\ncoatings began to form when the comet was as distant as the orbit of\r\nJupiter, and in its return they very soon entirely vanished; but a new\r\none was formed after it had retreated as far as the orbit of Mars, which\r\nlasted for a few days. Indeed, comets in general are subject to sudden\r\nand violent convulsions in their interior, even when far from the sun,\r\nwhich produce changes that are visible at enormous distances, and baffle\r\nall attempts at explanation—probably arising from electricity, or even\r\ncauses with which we are unacquainted. The envelopes surrounding the\r\nnucleus of the comet on the side next to the sun diverge on the opposite\r\nside, where they are prolonged into the form of a hollow cone, which is\r\nthe tail. Two repulsive forces seem to be concerned in producing this\r\neffect; one from the comet and another from the sun, the latter being\r\nthe most powerful. The envelopes are nearer the centre of the comet on\r\nthe side next to the sun, where these forces are opposed to one another;\r\nbut on the other side the forces conspire to form the tail, conveying\r\nthe nebulous particles to enormous distances.\r\n\r\nThe lateral edges of the tail reflect more light than the central part,\r\nbecause the line of vision passes through a greater depth of nebulous\r\nmatter, which produces the effect of two streams somewhat like the\r\naurora. Stars shine with undiminished lustre through the central part of\r\nthe tail, because their rays traverse it perpendicularly to its\r\nthickness; but, though distinctly seen through its edges, their light is\r\nweakened by its oblique transmission. The tail of the great comet of\r\n1811 was of wonderful tenuity; stars which would have been entirely\r\nconcealed by the slightest fog were seen through 64,000 leagues of\r\nnebulous matter without the smallest refraction. Possibly some part of\r\nthe changes in the appearance of the tails arises from rotation. Several\r\ncomets have been observed to rotate about an axis passing through the\r\ncentre of the tail. That of 1825 performed its rotation in 20-1/2 hours,\r\nand the rapid changes in the luminous sectors which issued from the\r\nnucleus of Halley’s comet in all probability were owing to rotatory\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nThe two streams of light which form the edges of the tail in most cases\r\nunite at a greater or less distance from the nucleus, and are generally\r\nsituate in the plane of the orbit. The tails follow comets in their\r\ndescent towards the sun, but precede them in their return, with a small\r\ndegree of curvature; their apparent extent and form vary according to\r\nthe positions of the orbits with regard to the ecliptic. In some cases\r\nthe tail has been at right angles to the line joining the sun and comet.\r\nThe curvature is in part owing to the resistance of the ether, and\r\npartly to the velocity of the comet being greater than that of the\r\nparticles at the extremity of its tail, which lag behind. The tails are\r\ngenerally of enormous lengths; the comet of 1811 had one no less than a\r\nhundred millions of miles in length, and those which appeared in the\r\nyears 1618, 1680, and 1769, had tails which extended respectively over\r\n104, 90, and 97 degrees of space. Consequently, when the heads of these\r\ncomets were set, a portion of the extremity of their tails was still in\r\nthe zenith. Sometimes the tail is divided into several branches, like\r\nthe comet of 1744, which had six, separated by dark intervals, each of\r\nthem about 4° broad, and from 30° to 44° long. They were probably formed\r\nby three hollow cones of the nebulous matter proceeding from the\r\ndifferent envelopes, and enclosing one another, with intervals between;\r\nthe lateral edges of these cones would give the appearance of six\r\nstreams of light. The tails do not attain their full magnitude till the\r\ncomet has left the sun. When comets first appear, they resemble round\r\nfilms of vapour, with little or no tail. As they approach the sun, they\r\nincrease in brilliancy, and their tail in length, till they are lost in\r\nhis rays; and it is not till they emerge from the sun’s more vivid light\r\nthat they assume their full splendour. They then gradually decrease,\r\ntheir tails diminish, and they disappear, nearly or altogether, before\r\nthey are beyond the sphere of telescopic vision. Many comets have no\r\ntails, as, for example, Encke’s comet. Those which appeared in the years\r\n1585, 1763, and 1682, were also without tails, though the latter is\r\nrecorded to have been as bright as Jupiter. The matter of the tail must\r\nbe extremely buoyant to precede a body moving with such velocity:\r\nindeed, the rapidity of its ascent cannot be accounted for. It has been\r\nattributed to that power in the sun which produces those vibrations of\r\nether which constitute light; but as this theory will not account for\r\nthe comet of 1824, which is said to have had two tails, one directed\r\ntowards the sun, and a very short one diametrically opposite to it, our\r\nignorance on this subject must be confessed. In this case the repelling\r\npower of the comet seems to have been greater than that of the sun.\r\nWhatever that unknown power may be, there are instances in which its\r\neffects are enormous; for, immediately after the great comet of 1680 had\r\npassed its perihelion, its tail was 100,000,000 miles in length, and was\r\nprojected from the comet’s head in the short space of two days. A body\r\nof such extreme tenuity as a comet is most likely incapable of an\r\nattraction powerful enough to recall matter sent to such an enormous\r\ndistance; it is therefore, in all probability, scattered in space or\r\nabsorbed by the zodiacal light or nebula that surrounds the sun, which\r\nmay account for the rapid decrease observed in the tails of comets every\r\ntime they return to their perihelia. Should the great comet of 1843\r\nprove to be the same with that of 1668, its tail must have diminished\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that, although the tails of comets increase in length\r\nas they approach their perihelia, there is reason to believe that the\r\nreal diameter of the head contracts on coming near the sun, and expands\r\nrapidly on leaving him. Hevelius first observed this phenomenon, which\r\nEncke’s comet has exhibited in a very extraordinary degree. On the 28th\r\nof October, 1828, this comet was about three times as far from the sun\r\nas it was on the 24th of December; yet at the first date its apparent\r\ndiameter was twenty-five times greater than at the second, the decrease\r\nbeing progressive. M. Valz attributes the circumstance to a real\r\ncondensation of volume from the pressure of the ethereal medium, which\r\nincreases most rapidly in density towards the surface of the sun, and\r\nforms an extensive atmosphere around him. It did not occur to M. Valz,\r\nhowever, that the ethereal fluid would penetrate the nebulous matter\r\ninstead of compressing it. Sir John Herschel, on the contrary,\r\nconjectures that it may be owing to the alternate conversion of\r\nevaporable materials in the upper regions of the transparent atmosphere\r\nof comets into the states of visible cloud and invisible gas by the\r\neffects of heat and cold; or that some of the external nebulous\r\nenvelopes may come into view when the comet arrives at a darker part of\r\nthe sky, which were overpowered by the superior light of the sun while\r\nin his vicinity. The first of these hypotheses he considers to be\r\nperfectly confirmed by his observations on Halley’s comet, made at the\r\nCape of Good Hope, after its return from the sun. He thinks that, in all\r\nprobability, the whole comet, except the densest part of its head,\r\nvanished, and was reduced to a transparent and invisible state during\r\nits passage at its perihelion: for when it first came into view, after\r\nleaving the sun, it had no tail, and its aspect was completely changed.\r\nA parabolic envelope soon began to appear, and increased so much and so\r\nrapidly that its augmentation was visible to the eye. This increase\r\ncontinued till it became so large and so faint, that at last it vanished\r\nentirely, leaving only the nucleus and a tail, which it had again\r\nacquired, but which also vanished; so that at last the nucleus alone\r\nremained. Not only the tails, but the nebulous part of comets,\r\ndiminishes every time they return to their perihelia; after frequent\r\nreturns they ought to lose it altogether, and present the appearance of\r\na fixed nucleus: this ought to happen sooner to comets of short periods.\r\nM. de la Place supposes that the comet of 1682 must be approaching\r\nrapidly to that state. Should the substances be altogether, or even to a\r\ngreat degree, evaporated, the comet would disappear for ever. Possibly\r\ncomets may have vanished from our view sooner than they would otherwise\r\nhave done from this cause.\r\n\r\nThe comet discovered at Florence by Signore Donati, on the 2nd of June,\r\n1858, was one of the most beautiful that has been seen from our planet\r\nfor many years, whether for the brightness of the _nucleus_, or the\r\nlength and graceful form of the _coma_; when first discovered it was\r\nnear the star λ in the constellation of the Lion, being then at a\r\ndistance of 288,000,000 miles from the earth; during the month of August\r\nits nucleus assumed an almost planetary aspect from the concentration of\r\nits light; on the 27th of September the head appeared almost as bright\r\nas Mercury, but smaller; when near its perihelion passage, on September\r\n30th, its diameter, as ascertained by Signore Donati, was 3ʺ; during the\r\nearly part of October it continued to increase in brilliancy, the tail\r\nbecoming more elongated, and describing a beautiful arc in the heavens,\r\noccupying a space of nearly 40°, or a length of 40,000,000 miles in the\r\nsolar system. On the evening of the 5th of October it was seen from most\r\nparts of Britain, within 20ʹ of Arcturus, the brightest star in the\r\nnorthern heavens, across which the densest part nearly of the tail\r\npassed, and through which notwithstanding the star shone with\r\nundiminished brilliancy. On the 30th of October, when in perihelio, the\r\ncomet was only 55,000,000 miles from the sun; on the 10th it approached\r\nnearest to the earth, from which it was then distant 51,000,000 miles;\r\nand on the 15th of the same month near to Venus, being at that time less\r\nthan one-tenth the distance of the earth from the Sun; if the comet had\r\nreached its perihelion a few days earlier, Venus might have passed\r\nthrough its nucleus, the consequences of which to the planet it would be\r\nvery difficult to imagine. The motion of Donati’s comet is what\r\nastronomer’s call _retrograde_, or from east to west. It ceased to be\r\nvisible in our northern latitudes in the last week in October, having\r\npassed into the southern heavens, where it will traverse the\r\nconstellations of Sagittarius, Telescopium, and Indus, approaching the\r\nlarge star of Toucan; after which it will disappear until it has nearly\r\ncompleted its revolution round the sun. The observed orbit of this\r\nremarkable comet coincides more nearly with an ellipse than a parabola;\r\nthe longer diameter of the ellipse being 184 times that of the earth’s\r\norbit, or the immense distance of 35,100,000,000 miles—a space which,\r\nhowever great, is less than the thousandth of the distance of the\r\nnearest fixed star. According to the calculations of M. Loewy, and\r\nadopting an elliptic orbit, Donati’s comet will not return to the same\r\nplaces in the heavens for 2495 years, being 500 less than the period of\r\nrevolution of the great comet of 1811.\r\n\r\nSignore Donati observed that between the 25th and 30th September two\r\nconcentric, luminous, semicircular envelopes, with a dark space between\r\nthem, were formed in the head. From the extremities of these the cone of\r\nthe tail extended, and a non-luminous or dark space stretched for 20°\r\nfrom the nucleus into the tail. On the 1st October the two envelopes\r\nwere combined into one. This comet, like Halley’s, has shown some\r\nsingular irregularities, supposed to arise from the action of the sun\r\nwhen near its perihelion. At different periods of its apparition a\r\nviolent agitation was observed in its nucleus, with luminous jets,\r\nspiral offshoots, &c., as in the great comets of 1680, 1744, 1811. A ray\r\nof light was thrown out from one side of the nucleus towards the sun,\r\nwhile a gas-like jet proceeded from the other side, which appeared to\r\nform the origin of a second tail within the great tail, and which was\r\ntraced for half a degree by Mr. Hind on the 19th September. He observed\r\ndecided spiral convolutions in the tail, which show that this comet has\r\na rotatory motion about an axis passing through the tail.\r\n\r\nIf comets shine by borrowed light, they ought, in certain positions, to\r\nexhibit phases like the moon; but no such appearance has been detected,\r\nexcept in one instance, when they are said to have been observed by\r\nHevelius and La Hire, in the year 1682. In general, the light of comets\r\nis dull—that of the comet of 1811 was only equal to the tenth part of\r\nthe light of the full moon—yet some have been brilliant enough to be\r\nvisible in full daylight, especially the comet of 1744, which was seen\r\nwithout a telescope at one o’clock in the afternoon, while the sun was\r\nshining. Hence it may be inferred that, although some comets may be\r\naltogether diaphanous, others seem to possess a solid mass resembling a\r\nplanet. But whether they shine by their own or by reflected light has\r\nnever been satisfactorily made out till now. Even if the light of a\r\ncomet were polarized, it would not afford a decisive test, since a body\r\nis capable of reflecting light, though it shines by its own. M. Arago,\r\nhowever, has, with great ingenuity, discovered a method of ascertaining\r\nthis point, independent both of phases and polarization.\r\n\r\nSince the rays of light diverge from a luminous point, they will be\r\nscattered over a greater space as the distance increases, so that the\r\nintensity of the light on a screen two feet from the object is four\r\ntimes less than at the distance of one foot; three feet from the object\r\nit is nine times less; and so on, decreasing in intensity as the square\r\nof the distance increases. As a self-luminous surface consists of an\r\ninfinite number of luminous points, it is clear that, the greater the\r\nextent of surface, the more intense will be the light; whence it may be\r\nconcluded that the illuminating power of such a surface is proportional\r\nto its extent, and decreases inversely as the square of the distance.\r\nNotwithstanding this, a self-luminous surface, plane or curved, viewed\r\nthrough a hole in a plate of metal, is of the same brilliancy at all\r\npossible distances as long as it subtends a sensible angle, because, as\r\nthe distance increases, a greater portion comes into view; and, as the\r\naugmentation of surface is as the square of the diameter of the part\r\nseen through the whole, it increases as the square of the distance.\r\nHence, though the number of rays from any one point of the surface which\r\npass through the hole decreases inversely as the square of the distance,\r\nyet, as the extent of surface which comes into view increases also in\r\nthat ratio, the brightness of the object is the same to the eye as long\r\nas it has a sensible diameter. For example—Uranus is about nineteen\r\ntimes farther from the sun than we are, so that the sun, seen from that\r\nplanet, must appear like a star with a diameter of a hundred seconds,\r\nand must have the same brilliancy to the inhabitants that he would have\r\nto us if viewed through a small circular hole having a diameter of a\r\nhundred seconds. For it is obvious that light comes from every point of\r\nthe sun’s surface to Uranus, whereas a very small portion of his disc is\r\nvisible through the hole; so that extent of surface exactly compensates\r\ndistance. Since, then, the visibility of a self-luminous object does not\r\ndepend upon the angle it subtends as long as it is of sensible\r\nmagnitude, if a comet shines by its own light, it should retain its\r\nbrilliancy as long as its diameter is of a sensible magnitude; and, even\r\nafter it has lost an apparent diameter, it ought to be visible, like the\r\nfixed stars, and should only vanish in consequence of extreme\r\nremoteness. That, however, is far from being the case—comets gradually\r\nbecome dim as their distance increases, and vanish merely from loss of\r\nlight, while they still retain a sensible diameter, which is proved by\r\nobservations made the evening before they disappear. It may therefore be\r\nconcluded that comets shine by reflecting the sun’s light. The most\r\nbrilliant comets have hitherto ceased to be visible when about five\r\ntimes as far from the sun as we are. Most of the comets that have been\r\nvisible from the earth have their perihelia within the orbit of Mars,\r\nbecause they are invisible when as distant as the orbit of Saturn: on\r\nthat account there is not one on record whose perihelion is situate\r\nbeyond the orbit of Jupiter. Indeed, the comet of 1756, after its last\r\nappearance, remained five whole years within the ellipse described by\r\nSaturn without being once seen. More than a hundred and forty comets\r\nhave appeared within the earth’s orbit during the last century that have\r\nnot again been seen. If a thousand years be allowed as the average\r\nperiod of each, it may be computed, by the theory of probabilities, that\r\nthe whole number which range within the earth’s orbit must be 1400; but,\r\nUranus being about nineteen times more distant, there may be no less\r\nthan 11,200,000 comets that come within the orbit of Uranus. M. Arago\r\nmakes a different estimate; he considers that, as thirty comets are\r\nknown to have their perihelion distance within the orbit of Mercury, if\r\nit be assumed that comets are uniformly distributed in space, the number\r\nhaving their perihelion within the orbit of Uranus must be to thirty as\r\nthe cube of the radius of the orbit of Uranus to the cube of the radius\r\nof the orbit of Mercury, which makes the number of comets amount to\r\n3,529,470. But that number may be doubled, if it be considered that, in\r\nconsequence of daylight, fogs, and great southern declination, one comet\r\nout of two must be hid from us. According to M. Arago, more than seven\r\nmillions of comets come within the orbit of Uranus.\r\n\r\nThe different degrees of velocity with which the planets and comets were\r\noriginally propelled in space is the sole cause of the diversity in the\r\nform of their orbits, which depends only upon the mutual relation\r\nbetween the projectile force and the sun’s attraction.\r\n\r\nWhen the two forces are exactly equal to one another, circular motion is\r\nproduced; when the ratio of the projectile to the central force is\r\nexactly that of 1 to the square root of 2, the motion is parabolic; any\r\nratio between these two will cause a body to move in an ellipse, and any\r\nratio greater than that of 1 to the square root of 2 will produce\r\nhyperbolic motion (N. 229).\r\n\r\nThe celestial bodies might move in any one of these four curves by the\r\nlaw of gravitation: but, as one particular velocity is necessary to\r\nproduce either circular or parabolic motion, such motions can hardly be\r\nsupposed to exist in the solar system, where the bodies are liable to\r\nsuch mutual disturbances as would infallibly change the ratio of the\r\nforces, and cause them to move in ellipses in the first case, and\r\nhyperbolas in the other. On the contrary, since every ratio between\r\nequality and that of 1 to the square root of 2 will produce elliptical\r\nmotion, it is found in the solar system in all its varieties, from that\r\nwhich is nearly circular to such as borders on the parabolic from\r\nexcessive ellipticity. On this depends the stability of the system; the\r\nmutual disturbances only cause the orbits to become more or less\r\nexcentric without changing their nature.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason the bodies of the solar system might have moved in\r\nan infinite variety of hyperbolas, since any ratio of the forces,\r\ngreater than that which causes parabolic motion, will make a body move\r\nin one of these curves. Hyperbolic motion is however very rare; only two\r\ncomets appear to move in orbits of that nature, those of 1771 and 1824;\r\nprobably all such comets have already come to their perihelia, and\r\nconsequently will never return.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of the forces which fixed the nature of the celestial orbits\r\nis thus easily explained; but the circumstances which determined these\r\nratios, which caused some bodies to move nearly in circles and others to\r\nwander towards the limits of the solar attraction, and which made all\r\nthe heavenly bodies to rotate and revolve in the same direction, must\r\nhave had their origin in the primeval state of things; but as it pleases\r\nthe Supreme Intelligence to employ gravitation alone in the maintenance\r\nof this fair system, it may be presumed to have presided at its\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION XXXVI.\r\n\r\nThe Fixed Stars—Their Number—The Milky Way—Double Stars—Binary\r\n  Systems—Their Orbits and Periodic Times—Colours of the Stars—Stars\r\n  that have vanished—Variable Stars—Variation in Sun’s Light—Parallax\r\n  and Distances of the Fixed Stars—Masses of the Stars—Comparative Light\r\n  of the Stars—Proper Motions of the Stars—Apparent Motions of the\r\n  Stars—Motion and Velocity of the Sun and Solar System—The Nebulæ—Their\r\n  Number—Catalogue of them—Consist of Two Classes—Diffuse\r\n  Nebulæ—Definitely formed Nebulæ—Globular Clusters—Splendour of Milky\r\n  Way—Distribution of the Nebulæ—The Magellanic Clouds—Nebulæ round η\r\n  Argûs—Constitution of Nebulæ, and the Forces that maintain\r\n  them—Meteorites and Shooting Stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT as the number of comets appears to be, it is absolutely nothing in\r\ncomparison of the multitude of the fixed stars. About 2000 only are\r\nvisible to the naked eye; but when the heavens are viewed through a\r\ntelescope, their number seems to be limited only by the imperfection of\r\nthe instrument. The number registered amounts to 200,000; their places\r\nare determined with great precision, and they are formed into a\r\ncatalogue, not only for the purpose of ascertaining geographical\r\npositions by the occultations of the brightest among them, but also to\r\nserve as points of reference for marking the places of comets and other\r\ncelestial phenomena. Sirius, α Centauri, and Arcturus are the brightest\r\nstars in the heavens; the others are classed according to their apparent\r\nlustre, from the first to the seventeenth magnitudes. Capella, α Lyræ,\r\nProcyon, and twenty or twenty-one more, are of the first magnitude; α\r\nPersei, γ Orionis, α Cygni, and in all fifty or sixty, are of the\r\nsecond; and of the third there are about 200, such as η Bootis and η\r\nDraconis, the numbers increasing as the magnitude diminishes. Those of\r\nthe eighth magnitude are scarcely visible to the naked eye, and it\r\nrequires a very good telescope to see stars of the seventeenth. This\r\nsequence is perfectly arbitrary; but Sir John Herschel has ascertained\r\nby actual measurement the comparative lustre of a great many—for\r\nexample, he found that the light of a star of the sixth magnitude is 100\r\ntimes less than that of one of the first magnitude, and that Sirius\r\nwould make between three and four hundred of such little stars. Were the\r\nphotometric scale completed, it would be of the greatest importance with\r\nregard to the variable stars.\r\n\r\nThe three or four brightest classes of stars are scattered pretty\r\nequably over the sky, with the exception of a zone or belt following the\r\ncourse of the great circle passing through ε Orionis and α Crucis, where\r\nthey are very numerous, especially in the southern hemisphere. The stars\r\nof all magnitudes visible to the naked eye increase in numbers towards\r\nthe borders of the Milky Way, which derives its lustre and name from the\r\ndiffused light of myriads of stars; so numerous are they in some parts\r\nof it that more than 50,000 passed through the field of Sir William\r\nHerschel’s telescope in the course of an hour, in a zone only two\r\ndegrees broad; in many places they are numerous beyond estimation, and\r\nmost of them are extremely small on account of their enormous distances.\r\n\r\nThe Milky Way, which forms so conspicuous a part of the firmament, is a\r\nvast and somewhat flattened stratum or congeries of stars, encircling\r\nthe heavens in a broad band, split through one part of its circumference\r\ninto two streams of stars, bearing a strong resemblance to fig. 5, plate\r\n5. It is contorted and broken in some places, and occasionally\r\nlengthened into branches stretching far into space. Its thickness is\r\nsmall compared with its length and breadth; yet in some places it is\r\nunfathomable even with the best telescopes; in others there is reason to\r\nbelieve that it is possible to see through it, and even beyond it, in\r\nits own plane. There is a gradual but rapid increase in the crowding of\r\nthe stars on each side of the flat stratum towards the centre.\r\n\r\nThe solar system is deeply though excentrically plunged into this mass\r\nof stars, near that point where the circular stratum splits into two\r\nstreams. Sir John Herschel’s description of the stars of the southern\r\nhemisphere shows that the Milky Way is a most magnificent object there.\r\n“The general aspect of the southern circumpolar regions (including in\r\nthat expression 60° or 70° of south polar distance) is in a high degree\r\nrich and magnificent, owing to the superior brilliancy and large\r\ndevelopment of the Milky Way, which, from the constellation of Orion to\r\nthat of Antinous, is a blaze of light, strangely interrupted, however,\r\nwith vacant and entirely starless patches, especially in Scorpio, near α\r\nCentauri and the Cross, while to the north it fades away pale and dim,\r\nand is in comparison hardly traceable. I think it is impossible to view\r\nthis splendid zone, with the astonishingly rich and evenly distributed\r\nfringe of stars of the 3rd and 4th magnitude, which forms a broad skirt\r\nto its southern border like a vast curtain, without an impression\r\namounting almost to conviction, that the Milky Way is not a mere\r\nstratum, but annular, or at least that our system is placed within one\r\nof the poorer or almost vacant parts of its general mass, and that\r\neccentrically, so as to be much nearer to the region about the Cross\r\nthan to that diametrically opposite to it.”\r\n\r\nThose dark vacuities called “Coal Sacks” by the ancient navigators,\r\nwhich are so numerous between α Centauri and α Antaris, are among the\r\nmost extraordinary phenomena in the southern hemisphere; they are of\r\nintense blackness, though by no means void of extremely small telescopic\r\nstars; the darkness arises from the contrast these nearly vacant spaces\r\nform with the excessive brilliancy of the surrounding part of the Milky\r\nWay, and the sudden sharp transition from light to darkness. The largest\r\nand most conspicuous of them is a pear-shaped vacuity close to the\r\nSouthern Cross. That portion of the Milky Way that is split\r\nlongitudinally through its centre lies between α Centauri and the\r\nconstellation of Cygnus: the two bands are joined here and there by\r\nnarrow bridges of condensed stars, stretching across the darker space\r\nbetween them. In Scorpio and Sagittarius Sir John Herschel describes the\r\nMilky Way as composed of definite clouds of light running into clusters\r\nof extremely minute stars like sand, not strewed evenly as with a sieve,\r\nbut as if thrown down by handfuls, and by both hands at once, leaving\r\ndark intervals. In this astonishing profusion the stars are of all\r\nsizes, from the 14th to the 20th magnitude, and even down to nebulosity.\r\nAfter an interval the same profusion is renewed, the stars being\r\ninconceivably minute and numerous beyond description—they are in\r\nmillions and millions. Thus there is great irregularity in their\r\ndiffusion as well as magnitude—in some places intensely crowded, in\r\nothers the deep blackness of the sky, over which they are thinly\r\nscattered, irresistibly led to believe that in these regions the power\r\nof our telescopes fairly penetrates through the starry stratum, and\r\nbeyond it. Sometimes we look through a sheet of stars nearly of the same\r\nsize, of no great thickness compared with their distance from us, and\r\nnot unfrequently there is a double stratum, one of large stars spread\r\nover another of very small ones.\r\n\r\nThe most southerly of the two streams of stars which form the Milky Way\r\nin this part of the firmament maintains an unbroken course of extreme\r\nbrilliancy, containing some of the finest clusters of stars in the\r\nheavens. One round γ Sagittarii is an intense aggregate of stars, in\r\nsome parts of which they are so crowded as to exceed enumeration; at a\r\nvery moderate estimate Sir John Herschel thinks this group cannot\r\ncontain fewer than a hundred thousand stars. Other two groups between\r\nthe constellations of the Shield and Ophiuchus stand out like\r\npromontories of intense brilliancy in the dark space that separates the\r\nstarry streams of the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nThe distance of the fixed stars is too great to admit of their\r\nexhibiting a sensible disc, but they must be spherical if gravitation\r\npervades all space, as there is every reason to believe it does. With a\r\npowerful telescope the stars are like points of light: their\r\noccultations by the moon are therefore instantaneous. Their twinkling\r\narises from sudden changes in the refractive power of the air, which\r\nwould not be sensible if they had discs like planets. Thus nothing can\r\nbe known of their distance from us or from one another by their apparent\r\ndiameters. Although from the appearance of the stars no inference can be\r\ndrawn as to their distance, yet among the multitudes in the heavens a\r\nfew are found near enough to exhibit distinct parallactic motions\r\narising from the revolution of the earth in its orbit, from whence their\r\ndistance from the sun has been computed: α Centauri, the brightest star\r\nin the southern hemisphere, is a very remarkable instance. Professor\r\nHenderson at the Cape of Good Hope determined its parallax to be 1ʺ by a\r\nseries of observations on its position at opposite periods of the year,\r\nthat is, from opposite points in the earth’s orbit. The result was\r\nafterwards confirmed by Mr. Maclear, who found the amount to be 0ʺ·913.\r\nThe difference between the two is wonderfully small, considering the\r\nmany unavoidable sources of error in the determination of such minute\r\nquantities (N. 230).\r\n\r\nSince no star in the northern hemisphere has so great an amount of\r\nparallax, an arc of 1ʺ is assumed as the parallactic unit. Now radius is\r\nto the sine of 1ʺ as 206,265 is to 1; hence, α Centauri is 206,265 times\r\nmore distant from the sun than the sun is from the earth. Light flying\r\nat the rate of 192,000 miles in a second must take 3 years and 83 days\r\nto come to us from that star.\r\n\r\nOne or two tenths of a second becomes a very great error when the\r\nmaximum amount of parallax is only 1ʺ, and on that account, with the\r\nexception of α Centauri, it has been found impracticable to determine\r\nthe annual changes in the apparent motions of single stars affected by\r\nprecession, nutation, aberration, and the variations of temperature of\r\nthe instruments used in observing. However, as two stars in\r\njuxtaposition are equally affected by all of these; the difference in\r\ntheir motions is independent of them. Of two stars apparently in close\r\napproximation, one may be far behind the other in space. They may seem\r\nnear to one another when viewed from the earth in one part of its orbit,\r\nbut may separate widely when seen from the earth in another position,\r\njust as two terrestrial objects appear to be one when viewed in the same\r\nstraight line, but separate as the observer changes his position. In\r\nthis case the stars would not have real, but only apparent motion. One\r\nof them would seem to oscillate annually to and fro in a straight line\r\non each side of the other, a motion that could not be mistaken for that\r\nof a binary system where one star describes an ellipse about the other;\r\nor if the edge of the orbit be turned towards the earth, where the\r\noscillations require years for their accomplishment. The only\r\ncircumstances that can affect the stars unequally, and which must be\r\neliminated, are the proper motion of the stars in space, and specific\r\naberration, a very minute quantity arising from peculiarities in the\r\nstar’s light. This method of finding the distances of the fixed stars\r\nwas proposed by Galileo and attempted by Dr. Long without success. Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel afterwards applied it to some of the binary groups; and\r\nalthough he did not find the thing he sought for, it led to the\r\ndiscovery of the orbital motions of the double stars.\r\n\r\nM. Struve was the first to apply this method, and that in a very\r\ndifficult case. He perceived that a very small star is close to α Lyræ,\r\nand by a series of most accurate differential measurements from 1835 to\r\n1838 he found that α Lyræ has a parallax of 0ʺ·261, which was afterwards\r\ncorroborated by the observations of M. Peters; hence α Lyræ is 789,600\r\ntimes more distant from the sun than the earth is.\r\n\r\nIt was natural to suppose that in general the large stars are nearer to\r\nthe earth than the small ones; but there is now reason to believe that\r\nsome stars, though by no means brilliant, are nearer to us than others\r\nwhich shine with greater splendour. This is inferred from the\r\ncomparative velocity of their proper motions; all the stars have a\r\ngeneral motion of translation, which tends ultimately to mix those of\r\nthe different constellations; but none that we know of moves so rapidly\r\nas 61 Cygni, and on that account it was reckoned to be nearer to us than\r\nany other, for an object seems to move more quickly the nearer it is.\r\nNow M. Bessel saw that two minute and probably very remote stars are\r\nvery near 61 Cygni, their directions from that star being at right\r\nangles to one another; so that, during the revolution of the earth, one\r\nof these distances was a maximum and the other a minimum alternately\r\nevery three months. This alternation, although it indicated a parallax\r\nor difference of parallaxes of only 0ʺ·348, was maintained with such\r\nperfect regularity every three months, that it leaves not a doubt of its\r\naccuracy, which was afterwards confirmed by the observations of M.\r\nPeters at Polkova. It follows from that small parallax that 61 Cygni\r\nmust be 592,700 times farther from the earth than the sun is—a distance\r\nthat light would not pass over in less than nine years and three months.\r\n\r\nMr. Henderson found the parallax of Sirius, the brightest of all the\r\nstars, to be only 0ʺ·230; it is consequently more distant than 61 Cygni,\r\nthough the latter is but of the 6th magnitude.\r\n\r\nM. Argelander has calculated that the apparent magnitude of the stars\r\ndepends upon their distance. Supposing them all to be of the same size,\r\nthe smallest visible in Sir William Herschel’s 20 feet reflecting\r\ntelescope, namely those of the 17th magnitude, would be 228 times\r\nfarther off than those of the first magnitude; and M. Peters of Polkova\r\nfrom the annual parallax of thirty-five, seven of which are now very\r\naccurately determined, has ascertained the distance of the nearest of\r\nthem to be such, that light flying at the rate of 95 millions of miles\r\nin a second would take 15 years and a half to come from them to the\r\nearth, and that a star of the 17th magnitude might be extinguished for\r\n3541 years before we should be aware of it. (N. 231.)\r\n\r\nThe great gulfs that separate the stars from the sun, and probably from\r\none another, no doubt maintain the stability of the stellar system, in\r\nthe same manner that in the solar system the distances of the planets\r\nfrom the sun and the satellites from their primaries are so arranged as\r\nto preserve their mutual disturbances within due limits. The stars\r\nsupposed to be nearest the sun are probably in a great zone which\r\ncrosses the Milky Way between η Argûs and α Crucis. It comprises the\r\nbright stars of the constellations Orion, Canis Major, the Southern\r\nCross, Centaur, Lupus, and Scorpio. The axis of the zone is inclined at\r\nan angle of 20° to the medial line, or circle, passing through the\r\ncentre of the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nA very great number of stars undergo periodical changes of lustre,\r\nvarying in some cases from complete extinction to their original\r\nbrilliancy, strongly suggesting the idea that they are temporarily\r\nobscured, and sometimes completely hid, by opaque bodies revolving round\r\nthem in regular periodic times, as the planets do about the sun.\r\n\r\nThe star Mira, or ω Ceti, which was first noticed to be periodical by\r\nFabricius, in 1596, appears about twelve times in eleven years, or in\r\nperiods of 331^d 8^h 4^m 16^s; it remains at its greatest brightness\r\nabout a fortnight, being then on some occasions equal to a large star of\r\nthe second magnitude; then it decreases during about three months, till\r\nit becomes completely invisible to the naked eye, in which state it\r\nremains about five months; after that it continues increasing during the\r\nremainder of its period. Such is the general course of its changes; but\r\nit does not always return to the same degree of brightness, nor increase\r\nand diminish by the same gradations, neither are the successive\r\nintervals of its maxima equal. From the observations and investigations\r\nof M. Argelander, the mean period given is subject to fluctuation,\r\nembracing 88 such periods, and having the effect of gradually\r\nlengthening and shortening alternately those intervals to the extent of\r\n25 days one way and the other. The irregularities in the degree of\r\nbrightness attained at the maximum are probably also periodical. For\r\nfour years previous to 1676 it did not appear at all; and on October 5,\r\n1839, it exceeded α Ceti, and equalled β Aurigæ, in lustre. These\r\nirregularities may be occasioned by periodical perturbations among\r\nopaque bodies revolving about the star. Algol, or β Persei, is another\r\nvery remarkable instance of a variable star. It has the size of a star\r\nof the second magnitude for two days and thirteen and a half hours, and\r\nthen suddenly begins to diminish in splendour, till, in about three\r\nhours and a half, it is reduced to the size of a star of the fourth\r\nmagnitude; it then begins again to increase, and in three hours and a\r\nhalf more regains its brightness, going through all these vicissitudes\r\nin 2^d 20^h 48^m 54^s·7. Sir John Herschel and Mr. Goodricke, by\r\nwhom the variable nature of this star was discovered in 1782, considered\r\nthis to be a case strongly indicative of the revolution of an opaque\r\nbody, which, coming between us and Algol, cuts off a large portion of\r\nthe light. This star has been constantly observed, and the more recent\r\nobservations, compared with the ancient ones, indicated a diminution in\r\nthe periodic time. It is even proved that this decrease is not uniformly\r\nprogressive, but is actually proceeding with accelerated rapidity,\r\nwhich, however, will probably not continue, but will by degrees relax,\r\nand then be changed into increase, according to the laws of periodicity,\r\nwhich, as well as their causes, remain to be discovered. The first\r\nminimum of this star, in 1844, happened on January 3rd, at 4^h 14^m\r\nGreenwich time. γ Hydræ also vanishes and reappears every 494 days. β\r\nLyræ was discovered to be variable, in 1784, by Mr. Goodricke, and its\r\nperiod was ascertained by Argelander to be 12^d 21^h 53^m 10^s, in\r\nwhich time a double maximum and minimum takes place, the two maxima\r\nbeing nearly equal, but the two minima unequal; besides these\r\nsemi-periods, there is a slow aberration of period, which appears to be\r\nperiodical itself: from its discovery to 1840 the time was continually\r\nlengthening, but more and more slowly, till, in 1840, it ceased to\r\nincrease, and has since been slowly on the decrease.\r\n\r\nThe stars δ Cephei and η Aquilæ, or Antinoi, were discovered to be\r\nvariable in 1784; their respective periods, being 5^d 8^h 47^m 39^s\r\nand 7^d 4^h 13^m 53^s, have since been accurately determined.\r\nBesides these, the variations of between 30 and 40 have been\r\napproximately ascertained, and a great many more among the smaller stars\r\nhave been discovered to be variable by Mr. Hind, who has remarked that\r\nmany of those stars which continue visible at their minimum appear hazy\r\nand indistinct, as though some cloudy or nebulous medium intervened.\r\nSome of the variable stars are red, and others present successive\r\nchanges through blue, yellow, and red. When the brightness is increasing\r\nthe star has a blueish tinge, when it is past its maximum lustre it\r\nassumes a yellow tint, and while on its decrease it becomes ruddy with\r\nflashes of bright red light. These changes are very marked in a small\r\nstar near the star 77, at the extremity of the south wing of Virgo.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel, after having described the glory of the starry\r\nheavens, asks, “For what purpose are we to suppose such magnificent\r\nbodies scattered through the abyss of space? Surely not to illuminate\r\n_our_ nights, which an additional moon of the thousandth part the size\r\nof our own would do much better, nor to sparkle as a pageant void of\r\nmeaning and reality, and bewilder us with vain conjectures. Useful, it\r\nis true, they are to man as points of exact and permanent reference; but\r\nhe must have studied astronomy to little purpose who can suppose man to\r\nbe the only object of his Creator’s care, or who does not see in the\r\nvast and wonderful apparatus around us provision for other races of\r\nanimated beings. The planets, we have seen, derive their light from the\r\nsun, but that cannot be the case with the stars. These doubtless then\r\nare themselves suns, and may perhaps, each in its sphere, be the\r\npresiding centre round which other planets or bodies, of which we can\r\nform no conception from any analogy offered by our own system, may be\r\ncirculating.”\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance shows how probable it is that dark bodies are\r\nrevolving among the stars. The proper motion of Sirius is very\r\nirregular—sometimes it is rapid, and at other times slow; the cause is\r\nascribed by MM. Bessel and Peters to a dark companion which revolves\r\nwith Sirius about their common centre of gravity, and by its attraction\r\ndisturbs the equable motion of the star.\r\n\r\nSometimes stars have all at once appeared, shone with a bright light,\r\nand vanished. Several instances of these temporary stars are on record.\r\nA remarkable one occurred in the year 125, which is said to have induced\r\nHipparchus to form the first catalogue of stars. Another star appeared\r\nsuddenly near α Aquilæ in the year 389, which vanished after remaining\r\nfor three weeks as bright as Venus. On the 10th of October, 1604, a\r\nbrilliant star burst forth in the constellation of Serpentarius, which\r\ncontinued visible for a year; and on the 11th of November, 1572, a star\r\nall at once shone forth in Cassiopeia, which rapidly increased in\r\nbrightness till it surpassed that of Jupiter so much as to be visible at\r\nmidday. It began to decrease in December of the same year, and, in\r\nMarch, 1574, it had entirely disappeared, having exhibited a variety of\r\ntints. It is suspected, however, that this star is periodically variable\r\nand identical with stars which appeared in the years 945 and 1264. A\r\nmore recent case occurred in the year 1670, when a new star was\r\ndiscovered in the head of the Swan, which, after becoming invisible,\r\nreappeared, and, having undergone many variations in light, vanished\r\nafter two years, and has never since been seen. On the 28th of April,\r\n1848, Mr. Hind discovered a star of the 5th magnitude in the\r\nconstellation Ophiuchus, which was very conspicuous to the naked eye,\r\nand where he was certain no star even so bright as the 9th magnitude had\r\never existed, nor was there any record of such a star. From the time of\r\nits discovery it continued to diminish till it became extinct. Its\r\ncolour was ruddy, and was thought to undergo remarkable changes,\r\nprobably an effect of its low position, as its polar distance was 102°\r\n39ʹ 14ʺ.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel discovered very singular variations in the star η of\r\nthe constellation Argo. It is surrounded by a wonderful nebula, and\r\nbetween the years 1677 and 1826 it varied twice from the 4th to the 2nd\r\nmagnitude; but in the beginning of 1838 it suddenly increased in lustre,\r\nso as to be nearly as bright as α Centauri. Thence it diminished, but\r\nnot below the first magnitude till April 1843, when it had again\r\nincreased, so as to surpass Canopus, and nearly equal Sirius in\r\nsplendour. With regard to this singular phenomenon, Sir John Herschel\r\nobserves, that “Temporary stars heretofore recorded have all become\r\ntotally extinct. Variable stars, as far as they have been carefully\r\nattended to, have exhibited periodical and regular alternations (in some\r\ndegree at least) of splendour and comparative obscurity; but here we\r\nhave a star fitfully variable to an astonishing extent, and whose\r\nfluctuations are spread over centuries, apparently in no settled period,\r\nand in no regular progression. What origin can we ascribe to these\r\nsudden flashes and relapses? What conclusions are we to draw as to the\r\ncomfort or habitability of a system depending for its supply of light\r\nand heat on so variable a source? Its future career will be a subject of\r\nhigh physical interest. To this account I will only add, that in the\r\nbeginning of 1838 the brightness of this star was so great as materially\r\nto interfere with the observations of that part of the nebula\r\nsurrounding it.” Sir John has also discovered that α Orionis is\r\nvariable, a circumstance the more remarkable as it is one of the\r\nconspicuous stars of our hemisphere, and yet its changes had never been\r\nremarked. The inferences Sir John draws from the phenomena of variable\r\nstars are too interesting not to be given in his own words. “A periodic\r\nchange existing to so great an extent in so large and brilliant a star\r\nas α Orionis cannot fail to awaken attention to the subject, and to\r\nrevive the consideration of those speculations respecting the\r\npossibility of a change in the lustre of our sun itself, which were\r\nfirst put forth by my father. If there be really a community of nature\r\nbetween the sun and the fixed stars, every proof that we obtain of the\r\nextensive prevalence of such periodical changes in those remote bodies\r\nadds to the probability of finding something of the kind nearer home. If\r\nour sun were ever intrinsically much brighter than at present, the mean\r\ntemperature of the surface of our globe would of course be\r\nproportionally greater. I speak now not of periodical, but secular\r\nchanges. But the argument is complicated with the consideration of the\r\npossible imperfect transparency of space, which may be due to material\r\nnon-luminous particles, diffused irregularly in patches analogous to\r\nnebulæ, but of great extent—to cosmical clouds, in short, of whose\r\nexistence we have, I think, some indication in the singular and\r\napparently capricious phenomena of temporary stars, and perhaps in the\r\nrecent extraordinary increase, and hardly less sudden diminution, of η\r\nArgûs.” Mr. Hind has come to the same conclusion with Goodricke and Sir\r\nJohn Herschel, that the changes in the variable stars are owing to\r\nopaque bodies revolving round them; indeed there are strong reasons to\r\nbelieve that there are solar systems analogous to our own in the remote\r\nregions of space. Our sun requires nine times the period of Algol to\r\nperform a revolution on its axis, while, on the other hand, the periodic\r\ntime of an opaque revolving body, sufficiently large to produce a\r\nsimilar temporary obscuration of the sun seen from a fixed star, would\r\nbe less than fourteen hours.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the decrease of light in some of the variable stars\r\nmay arise from large spots on their surface, like those occasionally\r\nseen in the radiant fluid masses on the surface of the sun. One of these\r\nspots which was measured by Sir John Herschel on the 20th of March,\r\n1836, with its penumbra, occupied an area of 3780 millions of square\r\nmiles; and the black central part of a spot that appeared on the 25th of\r\nMay following would have allowed the globe of the earth to drop through\r\nit, leaving a thousand miles clear of contact all around this tremendous\r\nabyss.\r\n\r\nAll the variable stars on record of which the places are distinctly\r\nindicated have occurred without exception in, or close upon, the borders\r\nof the Milky Way, and that only within the following semicircle, the\r\npreceding having offered no example of the kind.\r\n\r\nMany stars have actually disappeared from the heavens. 42 Virginis seems\r\nto be of the number, having been missed by Sir John Herschel on the 9th\r\nof May, 1828, and not again found, though he frequently had occasion to\r\nobserve that part of the sky. Mr. Cooper, of the Markree Observatory,\r\nhas given a list of fifty stars that are missing since the publication\r\nof his list of stars in 1847. Comparing the present state of the heavens\r\nwith more ancient catalogues, a much greater number have disappeared.\r\n\r\nThousands of stars that seem to be only brilliant points of light, when\r\ncarefully examined are found to be in reality systems of two or more\r\nsuns, many of which are known to revolve about one another. These binary\r\nand multiple systems are very remote, requiring powerful telescopes to\r\nshow the stars separately. They are divided into eight classes,\r\naccording to the proximity of the two stars. The first class comprises\r\nonly such as are less than 1ʺ of space apart; those of the second class\r\nare more apart than 1ʺ and less than 2ʺ, &c. &c. Sometimes the two stars\r\nare of equal magnitude, but more frequently a conspicuous star is\r\naccompanied by a smaller companion. In some cases the conspicuous star\r\nitself is double, as in ζ Cancri, ξ Scorpio, 11 Monocerotis, and 12\r\nLyncis, which are triple stars. Each of the two stars of ε Lyræ is a\r\nbeautiful and close double star; so that which in a common telescope\r\nappears merely to be a double star, is found to be quadruple with a very\r\nexcellent instrument. The multiple system of θ Orionis is one of the\r\nmost remarkable objects in our hemisphere. To the naked eye and with an\r\nordinary telescope it seems to be a single star, but it really consists\r\nof four brilliant stars forming a trapezium, and accompanied by two\r\nexcessively minute and very close companions, to perceive _both_ of\r\nwhich is the severest test of a telescope.\r\n\r\nThe first catalogue of double stars in which their places and relative\r\npositions are given was accomplished by the talent and industry of Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel, who made so many great discoveries, and with whom the\r\nidea of their combination in binary and multiple systems originated; and\r\nthat important fact he established by the discovery of a revolving\r\nmotion in 50 or 60, and by the determination of the revolution of one\r\nstar about the other of Castor or α Geminorum, the largest and finest\r\ndouble star in the northern hemisphere. He even assigned the approximate\r\nperiodic times of this and of several other binary systems. More than\r\n100 stars are now known to be stellar systems. The positions of many\r\nhundreds were measured by Sir John Herschel and Sir James South; and the\r\ncatalogue of the double stars in the northern hemisphere, which have\r\nbeen micrometrically measured, has been increased to more than 6000 by\r\nMM. Bessel, Struve, and British astronomers.\r\n\r\nExtensive catalogues of double stars in the southern hemisphere have\r\nbeen published by the astronomers in our colonial establishments. To\r\nthese Sir John Herschel added 1081 during his residence at the Cape of\r\nGood Hope: the angles of position and distances of the stars from one\r\nanother he measured, and found that many of them have very rapid orbital\r\nmotions. The elliptical elements of the orbits and periodic times of\r\nfifteen have been determined by the most eminent astronomers with\r\nwonderful accuracy, considering the enormous distances and the extreme\r\ndelicacy and difficulty of the subject. M. Savary has the merit of\r\nhaving first determined the elements of the orbit of a double star from\r\nobservation. The difficulty of doing so is great, because the nearest\r\nfixed star is 211,000 times farther from the sun than the earth is, and\r\nthe orbit itself is only visible with the best telescopes; consequently\r\na very small error in observation occasions an enormous error in the\r\ndetermination of quantities at that distance.\r\n\r\nIn observing the relative position of the stars of a binary system, the\r\ndistance between them, and also the angle of position, that is, the\r\nangle which the meridian, or a parallel to the equator, makes with the\r\nline joining the two stars, are measured. The different values of the\r\nangle of position show whether the revolving star moves from east to\r\nwest, or the contrary; whether the motion be uniform or variable, and at\r\nwhat points it is greatest or least. The measures of the distances show\r\nwhether the two stars approach or recede from one another. From these\r\nthe form and nature of the orbit are determined. Were observations\r\nperfectly accurate, four values of the angle of position, and of the\r\ncorresponding distances at given epochs, would be sufficient to assign\r\nthe form and position of the curve described by the revolving star;\r\nthis, however, scarcely ever happens. The accuracy of each result\r\ndepends upon taking the mean of a great number of the best observations,\r\nand eliminating error by mutual comparison. The distances between the\r\nstars are so minute that they cannot be measured with the same accuracy\r\nas the angles of position; therefore, in order to determine the orbit of\r\na star independently of the distance, it is necessary to assume, as the\r\nmost probable hypothesis, that the stars are subject to the law of\r\ngravitation, and consequently that one of the two stars revolves in an\r\nellipse about the other, supposed to be at rest, though not necessarily\r\nin the focus. A curve is thus constructed graphically by means of the\r\nangles of position and the corresponding times of observation. The\r\nangular velocities of the stars are obtained by drawing tangents to this\r\ncurve at stated intervals, whence the apparent distances, or radii\r\nvectores of the revolving star, become known for each angle of position,\r\nbecause, by the laws of elliptical motion, they are equal to the square\r\nroots of the apparent angular velocities. Now that the angles of\r\nposition estimated from a given line, and the corresponding distances of\r\nthe two stars, are known, another curve may be drawn, which will\r\nrepresent on paper the actual orbit of the star projected on the visible\r\nsurface of the heavens; so that the elliptical elements of the true\r\norbit, and its position in space, may be determined by a combined system\r\nof measurements and computation. But, as this orbit has been obtained on\r\nthe hypothesis that gravitation prevails in these distant regions, which\r\ncould not be known _à priori_, it must be compared with as many\r\nobservations as can be obtained, to ascertain how far the computed\r\nellipse agrees with the curve actually described by the star.\r\n\r\nγ Virginis consists of two stars of nearly the same magnitude; they were\r\nso far apart in the beginning and middle of last century, that they were\r\nmentioned by Bradley, and marked in Mayer’s catalogue, as two distinct\r\nstars. Since that time they have been continually approaching each\r\nother, till in January, 1836, one star was seen to eclipse the other, by\r\nAdmiral Smyth at his Observatory at Bedford, and by Sir John Herschel at\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope. A series of observations since the beginning of\r\nthe present century has enabled Sir John to determine the form and\r\nposition of the elliptical orbit of the revolving star with\r\nextraordinary truth by the preceding method. According to his\r\ncalculation, it came to its perihelion on the 18th of August of the year\r\n1834. Its previous velocity was so great that the revolving star\r\ndescribed an angle of 68° in one year. By the laws of elliptical motion\r\nits angular velocity must diminish till it arrives at its aphelion. The\r\naccuracy with which the motions of the binary systems are measured, and\r\nthe skill employed in the deduction of the elliptical elements, are now\r\nso great, that the periodic time of γ Virginis, determined by Sir John\r\nHerschel and Admiral Smyth from their respective observatories, combined\r\nwith those of Sir William Herschel, only differ by two years, Sir John\r\nhaving obtained a period of 182 years, Admiral Smyth that of 180. By the\r\naid of more numerous observations Mr. Fletcher has found that the true\r\nperiod is 184·53 years, and that the revolving star passed its\r\nperihelion in 1837. It is by such successive steps that astronomy is\r\nbrought to perfection (N. 232).\r\n\r\nSome of the double stars have very long periods, such as ς Coronæ, where\r\nthe revolving star takes 737 years nearly to accomplish a circuit.\r\nOthers again have very short periods, as η Coronæ, ζ Cancri, and ξ Ursæ\r\nMajoris, whose periodic times are 42·500, 58·91, and 58·26 years\r\nrespectively: therefore each of these has performed more than one entire\r\nrevolution since their motions were observed. ζ Herculis, whose periodic\r\ntime is only about 30-1/4 years, has accomplished two complete circuits,\r\nthe lesser star having been eclipsed by the greater each time. The first\r\nof these two truly wonderful events, of one sun eclipsing another sun,\r\nwas seen by Sir William Herschel in 1782.\r\n\r\nThe orbits and periodic times of so many of these binary systems having\r\nbeen determined proves beyond a doubt that sun revolves about sun in the\r\nstarry firmament by the same law of gravitation that makes the earth and\r\nplanets revolve about the sun (N. 232).\r\n\r\nSince the parallax of 61 Cygni and that of α Centauri have been\r\ndetermined, Sir John Herschel has made the following approximation to\r\nthe dimensions of their orbits and masses. The distance between the two\r\nstars of 61 Cygni, that is the radius vector of the revolving star, has\r\nhardly varied from 15ʺ·5 ever since the earliest observations; while in\r\nthat time the star has moved through 50°; it is evident therefore that\r\nthe orbit must be nearly circular. It is at right angles to the visual\r\nray, and the periodic time is 514 years. The parallax or radius of the\r\nearth’s orbit as seen from the star is 0ʺ·348, while the radius of the\r\nstar’s orbit as seen from the earth is 15ʺ·5; hence the radius of the\r\nstar’s orbit is to that of the earth’s orbit as 15ʺ·5 to 0ʺ·348, or\r\nnearly as 45 to 1. So the orbit described by the two stars of 61 Cygni\r\nabout one another greatly exceeds that which Neptune describes about the\r\nsun. Since the mean distance of the stars and their periodic time are\r\ngiven, the sum of the masses of the two stars is computed to be 0·3529,\r\nthat of the sun being 1. Thus our sun is not vastly greater nor vastly\r\nless than the stars composing 61 Cygni, which is a small inconspicuous\r\nstar to the naked eye, not exceeding the 6th magnitude.\r\n\r\nOf all the double stars α Centauri is the most beautiful: it is the\r\nbrightest star in the southern hemisphere, equal, if not superior, to\r\nArcturus in lustre. The distance between the two stars has been\r\ndecreasing at the rate of half a second annually since the year 1822,\r\nwhile the angular motion has undergone very little change, which shows\r\nthat the plane of the orbit passes through the earth like the orbits of\r\n44 Boötes, and π Serpentarii; that is to say, the edge of the orbit in\r\nthese three stellar systems is presented to the earth, so that the\r\nrevolving star seems to move in a straight line, and to oscillate on\r\neach side of its primary. Were this libration owing to parallax, it\r\nwould be annual from the revolution of the earth about the sun; but as\r\nyears elapse before it amounts to a sensible quantity, it can only arise\r\nfrom a real orbital motion seen obliquely. In this case five\r\nobservations are sufficient for the determination of the orbit, provided\r\nthey be exact; but the quantities to be measured are so minute, that it\r\nis only by a very long series of observations that accuracy can be\r\nattained. In 1834 Captain Jacob determined the periodic time of the\r\nrevolving star of α Centauri to be 77 years, and the distance between\r\nthe two to be 17ʺ·5; and since the decrease is half a second annually,\r\nthe distance or radius vector of the revolving star was 12ʺ·5 in the\r\nyear 1822; and as Mr. Henderson had determined the parallax or radius of\r\nthe earth’s orbit as seen from the star to be ·913, it follows that the\r\nreal semi-axis of the revolving star’s orbit is 13-1/2 times greater\r\nthan the semi-axis of the earth’s orbit as a minimum. The real\r\ndimensions of the ellipse therefore cannot be so small as the orbit of\r\nSaturn, and may possibly exceed that of Uranus. It is very probable that\r\nan occultation of one of the suns by the other will take place in 1867,\r\nor a very close appulse of the two stars.\r\n\r\nSingular anomalies have appeared in the motions of 70 Ophiuchi, which\r\nwas discovered to be a binary system by Sir William Herschel in 1779,\r\nand which has since nearly accomplished a revolution. Various orbits\r\nhave been computed: those which best represent the angles of position\r\nfail with regard to the distances of the stars from one another, and\r\n_vice versâ_. But it is a very remarkable fact that the errors are\r\nperiodical, being for considerable periods of time alternately in excess\r\nand defect. Captain W. S. Jacob, who determined the periodic time of the\r\nrevolving star to be 93 years, attributes this anomaly to the disturbing\r\naction of an opaque body revolving round the lesser star. Assuming that\r\nto be the case, and computing, he found that the errors were\r\nconsiderably diminished both in the angle of position and distance. It\r\nis a subject of the highest interest, and well worthy of the attention\r\nof such astronomers as have the means of making the necessary\r\nobservations. Among the triple systems, as ζ Cancri, two of the stars\r\nrevolve about one another in 58·9 years; but the motion of the third and\r\nmost distant is so slow, that it has only accomplished a tenth part of\r\nits revolution about the other two since the system was discovered.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the calculations of Mr. Dunlop that ς Eridani\r\naccomplishes a revolution in little more than 30 years. The motion of\r\nMercury is more rapid than that of any of the planets, being at the rate\r\nof 107,000 miles an hour. The perihelion velocity of the comet of 1680\r\nwas 880,000 miles an hour; but, if the two stars of ς Eridani, or of ξ\r\nUrsæ Majoris, be as remote from one another as the nearest fixed star is\r\nfrom the sun, the velocity of the revolving star must exceed the power\r\nof imagination to conceive. The elliptical motion of the double stars\r\nshows that gravitation is not confined to the planetary motions, but\r\nthat systems of suns in the far distant regions of the universe are also\r\nobedient to its laws. The stellar systems present a kind of sidereal\r\nchronometer, by which the chronology of the heavens will be marked out\r\nto future ages by epochs of their own, liable to no fluctuations from\r\nsuch disturbances as take place in our system. Some stars are apparently\r\ndouble, though altogether unconnected, one being far behind the other in\r\nspace, as α Lyræ, which apparently consists of two stars, one of the\r\nfirst, the other of the eleventh magnitude. Aldebaran, α Aquilæ, and\r\nPollux are remarkable instances of these optically double stars. It has\r\nbeen shown how favourable that circumstance is for ascertaining the\r\nparallax of the nearest of the two. (N. 232.)\r\n\r\nThe double stars are of various hues: sometimes both stars are of the\r\nsame colour, as in α Centauri and 61 Cygni, where the larger stars are\r\nof a bright orange and the smaller ones a deeper tint of the same, but\r\nthey most frequently exhibit the contrasted colours. The large star is\r\ngenerally yellow, orange, or red; and the small star blue, purple, or\r\ngreen. Sometimes a white star is combined with a blue or a purple, and\r\nmore rarely a red and white are united. In many cases these appearances\r\nare due to the influence of contrast on our judgment of colours. For\r\nexample, in observing a double star, where the large one is a full ruby\r\nred, or almost blood colour, and the small one a fine green, the latter\r\nloses its colour when the former is hid by the cross wires of the\r\ntelescope. That is the case with γ Andromedæ, which is a triple star,\r\nthe small one, which appears green, being closely double. ι Cancri is an\r\ninstance of a large yellow star and a small one which appears blue by\r\ncontrast. Still there are a vast number where the colours are decidedly\r\ndifferent, and suggest the curious idea of two suns, a red and a green,\r\nor a yellow and a blue, so that a planet circulating round one of them\r\nmay have the variety of a red day and a green day, a yellow day and a\r\nblue day. Sir John Herschel observes, in one of his papers in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions, as a very remarkable fact, that, although\r\nred stars are common enough, no example of a solitary blue, green, or\r\npurple star has yet been produced.\r\n\r\nSirius is the only star on record whose colour has changed. In the time\r\nof Ptolemy it was red; now it is one of the whitest stars in the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nM. Struve has found that, out of 596 bright double stars, 375 pairs have\r\nthe same intensity of light and colour; 101 pairs have different\r\nintensity, but the same colour; and 120 pairs have the colours of the\r\ntwo stars decidedly different.\r\n\r\nCertain rays, which exist in the sun’s light, are wanting in the spectra\r\nof every coloured star, and probably never existed in the light of these\r\nstars, as there is no reason to believe that they are absorbed by the\r\nstars’ atmosphere, though they may be by the earth’s. There are no\r\ndefective rays in the white light of Sirius, Procyon, and others; but\r\nSir David Brewster found in the spectrum of the orange-coloured light of\r\nζ Herculis a defective band in the red space, and two or more in the\r\nblue; consequently, the orange colour of the star is owing to a want of\r\nblue rays; for flames in which certain rays are wanting take the colour\r\nof the predominating rays. If the black rays in the solar spectrum were\r\nowing to the absorption of the sun’s atmosphere, the light from the\r\nmargin of his disc, having to pass through a greater thickness of it,\r\nwould exhibit deeper lines than that which comes from his centre; but,\r\nas no difference is perceptible, it may be inferred that the analogous\r\nbands in the light of the coloured stars are not due to the absorption\r\nof their atmospheres, but that they arise from the different kinds of\r\ncombustion by which these bodies are lighted up.\r\n\r\nAll the ordinary methods fail for finding the parallax when the\r\ndistances of the stars are very great. An angle even of one or two\r\nseconds, viewed in the focus of our largest telescopes, does not equal\r\nthe thickness of a spider’s thread, which makes it impossible to measure\r\nsuch minute quantities with any degree of accuracy. In some cases,\r\nhowever, the binary systems of stars furnish a method of estimating an\r\nangle of even the tenth of a second, which is thirty times more accurate\r\nthan by any other means. From them the actual distances of some of the\r\nmore remote stars will ultimately be known.\r\n\r\nSuppose that one star revolves round another in an orbit which is so\r\nobliquely seen from the earth as to look like an ellipse in a horizontal\r\nposition, then it is clear that one-half of the orbit will be nearer to\r\nus than the other half. Now, in consequence of the time which light\r\ntakes to travel, we always see the satellite star in a place which it\r\nhas already left. Hence, when that star sets out from the point of its\r\norbit which is nearest to us, its light will take more and more time to\r\ncome to us in proportion as the star moves round to the most distant\r\npoint in its orbit. On that account the star will appear to us to take\r\nmore time in moving through that half of its orbit than it really does.\r\nExactly the contrary takes place on the other half; for the light will\r\ntake less and less time to arrive at the earth in proportion as the star\r\napproaches nearer to us; and therefore it will seem to move through this\r\nhalf of its orbit in less time than it really does. This circumstance\r\nfurnishes the means of finding the absolute breadth of the orbit in\r\nmiles, and from that the true distance of the star from the earth. For,\r\nsince the greatest and least distances of the satellite star from the\r\nearth differ by the breadth of its orbit, the time which the star takes\r\nto move from the nearest to the remotest point of its orbit is greater\r\nthan it ought to be by the whole time its light takes to cross the\r\norbit, and the period of moving through the other half is exactly as\r\nmuch less. Hence the difference between the observed times of these two\r\nsemi-revolutions of the star is equal to twice the time that its light\r\nemploys to cross its orbit; and, as we know the velocity of light, the\r\ndiameter of the orbit may be found in miles, and from that its whole\r\ndimensions; for the position of the orbit with regard to us is known by\r\nobservation, as well as the place, inclination, and apparent magnitude\r\nof its major axis, or, which is the same thing, the angle under which it\r\nis seen from the earth. Since, then, three things are known in this\r\ngreat triangle, namely, the base or major axis of the orbit in miles,\r\nthe angle opposite to it at the earth, and the angle it makes with the\r\nvisual ray, the distance of the satellite star from the earth may be\r\nfound by the most simple of calculations. The merit of having first\r\nproposed this very ingenious method of finding the distance of the stars\r\nis due to M. Savary; but, unfortunately, it is not of general\r\napplication, as it depends upon the position of the orbit, and a long\r\ntime must elapse before observation can furnish data, since the shortest\r\nperiod of any revolving star that we know of is 30 years. Still the\r\ndistances of a vast number of stars may ultimately be made out in this\r\nway; and, as one important discovery almost always leads to another,\r\ntheir masses may thus be weighed against that of the earth or sun.\r\n\r\nThe only data employed for finding the mass of the earth, as compared\r\nwith that of the sun, are, the angular motion of our globe round the sun\r\nin a second of time, and the distance of the earth from the sun in miles\r\n(N. 233). Now, by observations of the binary systems, we know the\r\nangular velocity of the small star round the great one; and, when we\r\nknow the distance between the two stars in miles, it will be easy to\r\ncompute how many miles the small star would fall through by the\r\nattraction of the great one in a second of time. A comparison of this\r\nspace with the space through which the earth would descend towards the\r\nsun in a second will give the ratio of the mass of the great star to\r\nthat of the sun or earth. According to M. Bessel, the weight of the two\r\nstars of 61 Cygni is equal to half the weight of the sun. Little as we\r\nknow of the absolute magnitude of the fixed stars, the quantity of light\r\nemitted by many of them shows that they must be much larger than the\r\nsun. Dr. Wollaston determined the approximate ratio which the light of a\r\nwax candle bears to that of the sun, moon, and stars, by comparing their\r\nrespective images reflected from small glass globes filled with mercury,\r\nwhence a comparison was established between the quantities of light\r\nemitted by the celestial bodies themselves. By this method he found that\r\nthe light of α Lyræ is five and a half times greater than that of the\r\nsun. Sir John Herschel reflected the moon’s light _totally_ by a prism,\r\nwhich, concentrated by a lens, was compared directly with that of α\r\nCentauri. After making allowance for the quantity of the moon’s light\r\nlost in passing through the lens and prism, he found that the mean\r\nquantity of light sent to the earth by a full moon exceeds that sent by\r\nα Centauri in the proportion of 27,408 to 1. Now, Dr. Wollaston found\r\nthe proportion of the sun’s light to that of the full moon to be that of\r\n801,072 to 1. Hence, the light sent to us by the sun is to that sent by\r\nα Centauri as about twenty-two thousand millions to one. But, as the\r\nparallax of α Centauri is 1ʺ, it really is two and a half times brighter\r\nthan the sun. The light of Sirius is four times that of α Centauri, but\r\nits parallax is only 0ʺ·230: hence it has an intrinsic splendour 63·02\r\ntimes that of our luminary. It is therefore estimated to be a hundred\r\ntimes as large; so that, were Sirius in the earth’s place, its surface\r\nwould extend 150 times as far as the orbit of the moon. The light of\r\nSirius, according to the observations of Sir John Herschel, is 324 times\r\ngreater than that of a star of the sixth magnitude; if we suppose the\r\ntwo to be really of the same size, their distances from us must be in\r\nthe ratio of 57·3 to 1, because light diminishes as the square of the\r\ndistance of the luminous body increases.\r\n\r\nSo many of the stars have proper motions altogether independent of the\r\nannual rotation of the earth in its orbit, that it may be doubted\r\nwhether there be such a thing as a fixed star. Groombridge is the most\r\nrapid known: it has a proper motion of 7ʺ of arc annually; α Centauri\r\nmoves at the rate of 3ʺ·58 annually, and 61 Cygni describes a line in\r\nspace of 5ʺ·12 in the same time. These motions are probably in curves,\r\nbut at the distance of the earth they will appear to be rectilineal for\r\nages to come. The motion of little more than five seconds of space,\r\nwhich 61 Cygni describes annually, seems to us to be extremely small;\r\nbut at the distance of that star an angle of one second corresponds to\r\ntwenty-four millions of millions of miles; consequently the annual\r\nmotion of 61 Cygni is 120 millions of millions of miles, and yet, as M.\r\nArago observes, we call it a fixed star. From the same cause it is\r\nevident that the crowding of the stars in the Milky Way may be apparent\r\nonly, and that the stars may be at vast distances from one another, and\r\nno doubt are.\r\n\r\nWere the solar system and the whole of the stars visible to us carried\r\nforward in space by a motion common to all, like ships drifting in a\r\ncurrent, it would be impossible for us, moving with the rest, to\r\nascertain its direction. Sir William Herschel perceived that a great\r\npart of the motions of the stars is only apparent, arising from a real\r\nmotion of the sun in a contrary direction. Among many discrepancies he\r\nfound that the stars in the northern hemisphere have a general tendency\r\nto move towards a point diametrically opposite to λ Herculis, which he\r\nattributed to a motion of the solar system in a contrary direction. For\r\nit was evident to him, that the stars, from the effects of perspective\r\nalone, would seem to diverge in the direction to which the solar system\r\nwas going, and would converge towards the space it had left, and that\r\nthere would be a regularity in these apparent motions which would\r\nhereafter be detected. Since Sir William Herschel’s time the proper\r\nmotions of the stars have been determined with much greater accuracy,\r\nand many have been added to the list by comparing the ancient and modern\r\ntables of their places; his views have been established by four of the\r\ngreatest astronomers of the age, MM. Lundahles, Argelander, Otto Struve,\r\nand Peters, who have clearly proved the motion of the sun from that of\r\nthe stars in the northern hemisphere, and Mr. Galloway has come to the\r\nsame conclusion from the motions of the stars in the southern hemisphere\r\n(N. 234). The result is, that the sun, accompanied by all his attendant\r\nplanets, is moving at the rate of 422,424 miles—or over a space nearly\r\nequal to his own diameter—in the course of a day, and that the motion is\r\ndirected towards a point in a line joining the two stars μ and π\r\nHerculis at a quarter of the apparent distance of these two stars,\r\nreckoning from π Herculis. This investigation was founded upon no law\r\nassumed or observed, such as the circulation of all the stars of our\r\nfirmament about a common centre, though philosophers have speculated as\r\nto the probability of such a motion in the sun and stars in the plane of\r\nthe Milky Way. Should the sun and his stellar companions be moving in a\r\nnearly circular orbit, the centre of motion would be in the plane\r\npassing through the sun perpendicular to the direction of his motion.\r\nThe constellations through which that great circle would pass are\r\nPisces, Australis, Pegasus, Andromeda, Perseus, &c. M. Argelander is of\r\nopinion that the sun’s orbit is nearly in the plane of the Milky Way,\r\nand, therefore, that its centre must probably be in Perseus, while M.\r\nMädler places it in the Pleiades, which seems to be inadmissible; but\r\nthe data are too uncertain at present to admit of any absolute\r\nconclusion as to the sun’s orbit and the general motion of the stellar\r\nfirmament: for though the stars in every region of the sky tend towards\r\na point in Hercules, it is not yet known whether their motions are\r\nuniform or variable, whether the sun’s motion be gradually changing, and\r\nwhether the stars form different independent systems, each having its\r\nown centre of attraction, or if all obey one powerful controlling force\r\nwhich pervades the whole universe. Accurate observations of the places\r\nof a select number of stars of all dimensions in the Milky Way continued\r\nfor a series of years would no doubt decide this point.\r\n\r\nThe proper motion of a star combined with the progressive velocity of\r\nlight alters the apparent periodic time of the revolving star of a\r\nbinary system. If the orbit of a double star be at right angles to the\r\nvisual ray, and both the sun and the star at rest, the periodic time of\r\nthe revolving star, say of 10,000 days, would always be the same. But if\r\nthe centre of gravity of the star were to recede in a direct line from\r\nthe sun with the velocity of one tenth of the radius of the earth’s\r\norbit in a day, then at the end of 10,000 days it would be more remote\r\nfrom us by 1000 of such radii—a space light would take 57 days to\r\ntraverse: hence, although the periodic time of the star would really be\r\nthe same, the completion of its period would only be known to us 57 days\r\nafter it had taken place, so that the periodic time would appear to us\r\nto be 10,057 days instead of 10,000. Were the star to approach to the\r\nsun by the same quantity instead of receding, the apparent periodic time\r\nwould be diminished by 57 days.\r\n\r\nAs the sun is only a unit in the stellar system, so the Milky Way, and\r\nall the stars that adorn the firmament of both hemispheres, constitute a\r\ngroup which is but a unit among the infinite numbers of starry clusters\r\nand nebulæ that are profusely scattered throughout the universe.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of a good telescope there may be seen on the clear vault of\r\nheaven, between the stars of our own stellar system, and far in the\r\ndepths of space, an immense multitude of objects like comets or clouds\r\nof white vapour of all forms and sizes. Some are mixed with stars,\r\nothers are entirely formed of them. Many appear as if they were stellar,\r\nbut required a telescope of higher power to resolve them, and vast\r\nnumbers appear to be matter rarefied in the highest possible degree,\r\ngiving no indication of a stellar nature; and these are in every state\r\nof condensation, from a vague film hardly to be discerned to such as\r\nhave actually arrived at a solid nucleus of stars. The cloudy appearance\r\nis merely the blending of the rays of innumerable stars which are\r\nthemselves invisible from their extreme distance, like parts of the\r\nMilky Way. Sir William Herschel was at first of that opinion, and the\r\nnebulæ that have been resolved by Lord Rosse’s telescope have led\r\nastronomers to believe that such is the case. Yet the tails of comets,\r\nthe zodiacal light, and the extensive luminous atmospheres which\r\nencompass many of the stars, show that, in all probability, a\r\nself-luminous phosphorescent material substance in a highly diluted or\r\ngaseous form exists in vast abundance.\r\n\r\nThe number of the nebulæ, like that of the stars, is only limited by the\r\nimperfection of our instruments, for each improvement in the telescope\r\nonly enables us to penetrate a little farther into the infinity of\r\nspace—to see a few more of these shadowy existences in the far distance,\r\nand to resolve a few more of those that are comparatively near. Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel examined the nature and determined the position of 2500\r\nnebulæ in the northern hemisphere whose places were computed from his\r\nobservations, reduced to a common epoch, and arranged into a catalogue,\r\nin order of right ascension, by his sister, Miss Caroline Herschel, who\r\nadded lustre to the name she bore by her eminence in astronomical\r\nknowledge and discovery. Sir John Herschel revised his father’s\r\nobservations, and added 800 nebulæ to the catalogue before he went to\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, in order to complete the survey of the heavens.\r\nOn his return he published a catalogue of 2049 nebulæ of the southern\r\nhemisphere, of which 500 were previously unknown, with their position in\r\nthe heavens. In a work unparalleled for elegance of style, depth of\r\nknowledge, and originality of views, he has given engravings from his\r\ndrawings of the most remarkable objects, so that whatever changes may\r\ntake place in their form, place, or condensation, will be known by\r\nastronomers of future ages.\r\n\r\nThough infinite in variety, the nebulæ are of two distinct classes; one\r\nconsists of patches of great dimensions, capriciously irregular,\r\nassuming all the fantastic forms of clouds, now bright, now obscure;\r\nsometimes like vapour flying before the wind; sometimes stretching long\r\narms into space. Many present an ill-defined surface, in which it is\r\ndifficult to say where the centre of the greatest brightness is. Large\r\nportions are resolvable into stars; many have a granulated appearance,\r\nas if they were resolvable; and others probably are not so merely from\r\nthe smallness and closeness of the stars, and possibly from their\r\nremoteness, indicating the complex and irregular form the Milky Way\r\nwould present if seen from a distance. A wonderful nebula of this kind\r\nis visible to the naked eye in the constellation of Orion; it is of vast\r\nextent, sending branches even into the southern hemisphere; and,\r\nalthough Lord Rosse’s telescope has resolved much that had hitherto\r\nresisted others, there are parts that still maintain their nebulous\r\nappearance from extreme remoteness, presenting a kind of mottled aspect,\r\nlike flocks or wisps of wool, or mackerel sky. There can be no doubt of\r\nits being an unfathomable congeries of stars, which there is reason to\r\nbelieve has changed its form in some parts within the last fifty years.\r\nVast multitudes of nebulæ of this kind are so faint as to be with\r\ndifficulty discerned at all till they have been for some time in the\r\nfield of the telescope, or are just about to quit it. Occasionally they\r\nare so vague, that the eye is conscious of something being present,\r\nwithout being able to define what it is; but the unchangeableness of its\r\nposition convinces the mind that it is a real object—“an image was\r\nbefore mine eyes, but I could not discern the form thereof.”\r\n\r\nNo drawing can give an idea of the boundaries of such nebulæ as that of\r\nOrion; even with Lord Rosse’s telescope the edges either fade into a\r\nluminous mist, which becomes more rare till it is imperceptible, or end\r\nin a tissue of faintish flocculi, or in filaments which become finer and\r\nmore scattered till they cease to be visible, showing that the real\r\nboundaries have not been seen.\r\n\r\nThe other class of nebulæ, vastly inferior in size, of definite forms\r\nand great variety of character, are scattered through the remote\r\nheavens, or congregated in a great nebulous district far from the Milky\r\nWay. Many cling to stars like wisps of clouds, others are exactly like\r\ncomets with comæ and tails; but the most definite forms are annular and\r\nlenticular nebulæ, nebulous stars, planetary and elliptical nebulæ, and\r\nstarry clusters. However, there are two in the northern hemisphere\r\ndiffering from all of these, which are described by Sir John Herschel as\r\namazing objects. One in Vulpecula is like an hourglass or dumb bell of\r\nbright matter, surrounded by a thin hazy atmosphere so as to give the\r\nwhole an oval form, or the appearance of an oblate spheroid; with a\r\nhigher optical power its form is much the same, but the brighter part is\r\nresolved into stars, and the hazy part, though still nebulous, assumes\r\nthat mottled appearance which shows that the whole is a stellar system\r\nof the most peculiar structure: it is a phenomenon that bears no\r\nresemblance to any known object. (Fig. 3, plate 8, and fig. 3, plate 9).\r\nThe other is indeed most wonderful, and its history shows the gradual\r\nincrease in the space-penetrating power of telescopes. To Messier it\r\nappeared merely to be a double nebula with stars; with Sir William\r\nHerschel’s telescope it presented the appearance of a bright round\r\nnebula encompassed at a little distance by a halo or glory, and\r\naccompanied by a companion; while in Sir John Herschel’s 20 feet\r\nreflector it appeared to “consist of a bright round nucleus, surrounded\r\nat a distance by a nebulous ring split through half its circumference,\r\nand having the split portions separated at an angle of 45 degrees each\r\nto the plane of the other.” (Fig. 1, plate 10.) This nebula appeared to\r\nSir John to “bear a strong similitude to the Milky Way, suggesting the\r\nidea of a brother system bearing a real physical resemblance and strong\r\nanalogy of structure to our own.”\r\n\r\nThis object, which disclosed to Lord Rosse the astonishing phenomenon of\r\nspiral nebulæ seen in his telescope, presents the appearance of the fig.\r\n1 in plate 10, in which the partial division of the limb of the ring\r\ninto two branches is at once recognised in the bright convolutions of\r\nthe spiral. The outlying nebula is connected by a narrow curved band of\r\nlight with the ring; the whole is either resolved into stars, or\r\nevidently might be with a still higher optical power. With regard to the\r\nmarvellous nebula in question Lord Rosse observes, that “with each\r\nincrease of optical power the structure has become more complicated, and\r\nmore unlike anything that could result from any form of a dynamical law\r\nof which we find a counterpart in our system. The connection of the\r\ncompanion with this great nebula, of which there is not the least doubt,\r\nadds to the difficulty of forming any hypothesis. It is impossible that\r\nsuch a system could exist without internal movement, to which may be\r\nadded a resisting medium; but it cannot be regarded as a case of mere\r\nstatic equilibrium.” This is by no means the only instance of a spiral\r\nnebula; Lord Rosse has discovered several others: some are easily\r\nseen—others require the highest powers of his telescope. From the\r\nnumerous offsets that branch from the Milky Way and run far into space,\r\nit may possibly partake also of the spiral form.\r\n\r\nThere are seven annular nebulæ in the northern hemisphere, since Lord\r\nRosse has discovered that five of the planetary nebulæ belong to this\r\nclass. One of the finest examples of an annular nebula is to be seen\r\nmidway between β and γ Lyræ (fig. 2, plate 9). According to Sir John\r\nHerschel, it is elliptical in the ratio of 4 to 5, and is sharply\r\ndefined—the internal opening occupying about half the diameter. This\r\nopening is not entirely dark, but filled with a faint hazy light like\r\nfine gauze stretched over a hoop. Its diameter, if it is as far from us\r\nas 61 Cygni, must be 1300 times greater than the diameter of the earth’s\r\norbit—dimensions that are most astounding. Lord Rosse’s telescope\r\nresolves this object into stars of extreme minuteness, with filaments of\r\nstars adhering to its edges and a pretty bright star in its interior.\r\nThese rings are like hollow shells whose borders seem brighter because\r\nthe nebulous substance, whatever it may be, is more condensed to\r\nappearance than the central part. The other annular nebula in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere described by Sir John Herschel is a small faint\r\nobject, and more easily resolvable into stars. One of the annular nebulæ\r\nseen by Lord Rosse is surrounded by a faint external flat ring; another\r\nhas ansæ, as if an annular nebulous ring encompassed it and was\r\nforeshortened. Two annular nebulæ have perforations as if the black sky\r\nwas seen through openings in the interior haze, for in no instance is\r\nthe central opening quite dark.\r\n\r\nSome nebulæ are like very elliptical annular systems seen obliquely. If\r\nthey be elliptical flat rings, the dark centre may be a real opening;\r\nbut should the systems be a series of very long elliptical concentric\r\nshells surrounding a hollow, the dark axis may be merely a line of\r\ncomparative darkness.\r\n\r\nThe connection of the elliptical nebulæ with double stars is mentioned\r\nas very remarkable. In one elliptical nebula whose longer axis is 50ʺ\r\nthere are two individuals of a double star each of the 10th magnitude\r\nsymmetrically placed rather nearer the vertex of the ellipse than the\r\nfoci; in another the stars are unequal, but placed exactly at the\r\nextremities of the major axis, as in plate 8: besides these there are\r\nseveral other instances.\r\n\r\nDouble nebulæ are not unfrequent in both hemispheres, exhibiting all the\r\nvarieties of distance, position, and relative brightness, with their\r\ncounterparts the double stars. The rarity of single nebulæ as large,\r\nfaint, and as little condensed in the centre as these, makes it\r\nextremely improbable that two such bodies should be accidentally so near\r\nas to touch, and often in part to overlap each other, as these do. It is\r\nmuch more likely that they constitute systems; and, if so, it will form\r\nan interesting object of future inquiry to discover whether they possess\r\norbital motion.\r\n\r\nNebulous stars are beautiful objects, quite different from all the\r\npreceding. They are round or oval, increasing in density towards the\r\ncentre. Sometimes the central matter is so vividly and sharply condensed\r\nand defined that the nebula might be taken for a bright star surrounded\r\nby a thin atmosphere. One is a star of the 8th magnitude exactly in the\r\ncentre of a round bright atmosphere 25ʺ in diameter; the star is quite\r\nstellar, and not a nucleus: it has not the smallest appearance of being\r\nresolvable. Another nebulous star is ι Orionis, which has a broad\r\natmosphere in which is a dark cavity not symmetrical with the star, and\r\na small double star with a similar opening on the edge of the\r\natmosphere. Lord Rosse observes that these openings appear to be of the\r\nsame nature with that within the bright stars in the trapezium of Orion,\r\nthe stars being at its edge; and he is convinced that the stars are not\r\nonly connected with the nebula, but that they are equidistant with it;\r\nhence, if their parallax can be found, the distance of this nebula would\r\nbe determined. The zodiacal light or lenticular shaped luminous haze\r\nsurrounding the sun which may be seen extending beyond the orbits of\r\nMercury and Venus soon after sunset in the months of April and May, or\r\nbefore dawn in November and December, seems to place our luminary in the\r\nclass of nebulous stars. The extensive and delicate atmosphere of these\r\nnebulous stars assumes all degrees of ellipticity, from the circular to\r\nthe spindle-shaped ray, or almost the right line.\r\n\r\nPlanetary nebulæ have exactly the appearance of planets with round or\r\noval discs, sometimes sharply terminated, at other times hazy and\r\nill-defined. Their surface, which is blue or blueish white, is equable\r\nor slightly mottled, and their light occasionally rivals that of the\r\nplanets in vividness. They are generally attended by minute stars, which\r\ngive the idea of accompanying satellites. These nebulæ are of enormous\r\ndimensions. One near γ Aquarii has a sensible diameter of about twenty\r\nseconds, and another presents a diameter of twelve. Sir John Herschel\r\nhas computed that, if these objects be as far from us as the stars,\r\ntheir real magnitude, on the lowest estimation, must be such as would\r\nfill the orbit of Uranus. He concludes that, if they be solid bodies of\r\na solar nature, their intrinsic splendour must be far inferior to that\r\nof the sun, because a circular portion of the sun’s disc subtending an\r\nangle of twenty seconds would give a light equal to that of a hundred\r\nfull moons; while, on the contrary, the objects in question are hardly,\r\nif at all, visible to the naked eye. From the uniformity of the discs of\r\nthese planetary nebulæ, and their apparent want of condensation, he\r\npresumes that they may be hollow shells emitting light from their\r\nsurface only. The southern hemisphere is very rich in them, where\r\ntwenty-eight or twenty-nine have been discovered, some in the midst of a\r\ncluster of stars, with which they form a beautiful contrast. Three are\r\nof a decided blue colour, one Prussian blue, or verditer green, the\r\nother two of a bright sky blue, of great beauty and delicacy. One seems\r\nto belong to the class of double nebulæ or double stellar nebulæ of the\r\nutmost remoteness. Since Lord Rosse’s telescope has shown that five of\r\nthe planetary nebulæ are annular, some of those in the southern\r\nhemisphere may ultimately be found to belong to the same class.\r\n\r\nProbably nine tenths at least of the nebulous contents of the heavens\r\nconsist of spherical or elliptical forms presenting every variety of\r\nelongation and central condensation. Of these a great number have been\r\nresolved into stars, and a great many present that mottled appearance\r\nwhich renders it certain that an increase of optical power would\r\ndecompose them. Those which resist do so on account of the smallness and\r\ncloseness of the stars of which they consist.\r\n\r\nElliptical nebulæ are very common; by much the finest may be seen near\r\nthe star υ in the girdle of Andromeda. It is visible to the naked eye,\r\nand has frequently been taken for a comet. With a low optical power it\r\nhas the spindle-shaped form of fig. 6, plate 5, the brightness being at\r\nfirst gradually and then rapidly condensed towards the centre, so that\r\nit has been compared to a star shining through horn, but had never\r\nappeared resolvable even with high optical powers till Mr. Bond examined\r\nit at the observatory of Cambridge in the United States. He found that\r\nits brightness extends over 2-1/2 degrees in length, and more than a\r\ndegree in breadth, including two small adjacent nebulæ, so that it is\r\noval. It is strongly and rapidly condensed into a nucleus on its\r\nnorthern side; and although it was not all resolved, it was seen to be\r\nstrewed over with star dust, or extremely minute visible stars, which\r\nleaves not a doubt of its being a starry system. The most remarkable\r\npart of Mr. Bond’s discovery are two very narrow dark lines which extend\r\nalong one side of the oval parallel to its major axis. These black\r\nstreaks, difficult to distinguish, indicate a stratified structure, and\r\nare not the only instance of that arrangement in nebulæ. Fig. 1, in\r\nplate 9, is from Mr. Bond’s drawing of this nebula.\r\n\r\nMultitudes of nebulæ appear to the unassisted eye, or are seen with\r\nordinary telescopes, like round comets without tails; but when viewed\r\nwith powerful instruments they convey the idea of a globular space,\r\ninsulated in the heavens and full of stars, constituting a family or\r\nsociety apart from the rest, subject only to its own internal laws. To\r\nattempt to count the stars in one of these globular clusters, Sir John\r\nHerschel says, would be a vain task; they are not to be reckoned by\r\nhundreds. On a rough computation, it appears that many clusters of this\r\ndescription must contain ten or twenty thousand stars compacted and\r\nwedged together in a round space, whose apparent area is not more than a\r\ntenth part of that covered by the moon; so that its centre, where the\r\nstars are seen projected on each other, is one blaze of light. If each\r\nof these stars be a sun, and if they be separated by intervals equal to\r\nthat which separates our sun from the nearest fixed star, the distance\r\nwhich renders the whole cluster barely visible to the naked eye must be\r\nso great, that the existence of such a splendid assemblage can only be\r\nknown to us by light which must have left it at least a thousand years\r\nago. These magnificent globular or spheroidal aggregates of stars are so\r\narranged that the interior strata are more crowded and become more\r\nnearly spherical as they approach the centre. A most splendid object of\r\nthis nature may be seen in the constellation Hercules (N. 235).\r\n\r\nOf 131 of these magnificent objects in the southern hemisphere, two of\r\nthem are pre-eminently splendid. The globular cluster of α Centauri is\r\nbeyond comparison the finest of its kind: it is perfectly spherical, and\r\noccupies a quarter of a square degree; the stars in it are literally\r\ninnumerable, crowding and densely aggregated towards the centre; and, as\r\nits light is not more to the naked eye than that of a star of the 4th or\r\n5th magnitude, their minuteness is extreme. It has a dark hole in its\r\ncentre, with a bridge of stars across,—a circumstance peculiar to this\r\ncluster.\r\n\r\nLacaille’s globular cluster, or 47 Toucani, is completely insulated in a\r\nvery dark part of the sky not far from the lesser of the Magellanic\r\nclouds. The stars, which are of the 14th magnitude, immensely numerous,\r\ncompressed and white, form three distinct stages round a centre, where\r\nthey suddenly change in hue, and form a blaze of rose-coloured light.\r\nOne cluster consists of large ruddy stars and small white ones; another\r\nof greater beauty consists of shells or coats of stars of the 11th and\r\n15th magnitude. There are thirty globular clusters of extreme beauty\r\ncollected within a circular space of not more than eighteen degrees\r\nradius, which lies in the part of the sky occupied by the constellations\r\nCorona Australis, the body and head of Sagittarius, the tail of Scorpio,\r\npart of Telescopium and Ara. The Milky Way passes diametrically across\r\nthe circular area in question, which gives prodigious brilliancy to this\r\npart of the sky. For besides these globular clusters, which all lie in\r\nthe starry part, and not in the dark spaces, there are the only two\r\nannular nebulæ known to exist in the southern hemisphere. No part of the\r\nheavens is fuller of objects beautiful and remarkable in themselves, and\r\nrendered still more so by their mode of association, and by the peculiar\r\nfeatures assumed by the Milky Way, which are without a parallel for\r\nrichness and magnificence in any other part of the sky. Some of the\r\nglobular clusters are so remote that the stars are scarcely\r\ndiscernible—mere star dust. There is a double globular cluster in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere of very small dimensions, separated by a minute\r\ninterval,—a combination which suggests the idea of a globular cluster\r\nrevolving about a very oblate spheroidal one in the plane of the\r\nequator, and in an orbit which is circular, and seen obliquely like the\r\ncentral nebula itself, with a diameter somewhat more than four times the\r\nlatter,—a stupendous system doubtless, but of which the reality can\r\nhardly be supposed improbable.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be some connexion between ellipticity of form and\r\ndifficulty of resolution, for spherical clusters are in general easily\r\nresolved into their component stars, while there is scarcely an instance\r\nof an elliptical cluster yielding except to a very high optical power.\r\nVast masses of the nebulæ have never been resolved. Lord Rosse’s great\r\ntelescope has resolved parts of the nebula of Orion, and various others\r\nwhich had not yielded to instruments of less power; it enables the\r\nastronomer to penetrate farther into space, and shows objects with\r\ngreater clearness, than any other. But, excellent as this instrument is,\r\nthousands of nebulæ are not to be resolved even by it. Those who imagine\r\nthat any work of man can resolve all the nebulous matter in the heavens\r\nmust have a very limited idea of the extent and sublimity of creation.\r\n\r\nInnumerable nebulæ in both hemispheres take the form of clusters of\r\nstars, but are totally different from the globular clusters, inasmuch as\r\nthey are of irregular form and follow no uniform law of condensation.\r\nThe Pleiades is an instance in our own stellar system; for although only\r\n7 or 8 stars are visible to the naked eye, telescopes show that more\r\nthan 200 belong to the group. In the constellation Cancer there is a\r\nluminous spot called the Præsepe or Beehive, which a very low power\r\nresolves into stars; and the constellation Coma Berenices is another\r\nstellar group. Many are of exquisite beauty, as that round α Crucis,\r\nwhich, though consisting of only a hundred and ten stars, is like a\r\npiece of fancy jewellery, from the colours of the stars, which are\r\ngreenish white, green, blueish green, and red. Many of these clusters\r\ncontain thousands of stars, and are frequently in the poorer parts of\r\nthe sky, as if in the course of ages the stars had been attracted\r\ntowards a centre.\r\n\r\nThe existence of every degree of ellipticity in the nebulæ—from long\r\nlenticular rays to the exact circular form—and of every shade of central\r\ncondensation, from the slightest increase of density to apparently a\r\nsolid nucleus—may be accounted for by supposing the general\r\nconstitutions of those nebulæ to be that of oblate spheroidal masses of\r\nevery degree of flatness from the sphere to the disc, and of every\r\nvariety in their density and ellipticity towards the centre. It would be\r\nerroneous, however, to imagine that the forms of these systems are\r\nmaintained by forces identical with those already described, which\r\ndetermine the form of a fluid mass in rotation; because, if the nebulæ\r\nbe only clusters of separate stars, as in the greater number of cases\r\nthere is every reason to believe them to be, no pressure can be\r\npropagated through them. Consequently, since no general rotation of such\r\na system as one mass can be supposed, it may be conceived to be a\r\nquiescent form, comprising within its limits an indefinite number of\r\nstars, each of which may be moving in an orbit about the common centre\r\nof the whole, in virtue of a law of internal gravitation resulting from\r\nthe compound gravitation of all its parts. Sir John Herschel has proved\r\nthat the existence of such a system is not inconsistent with the law of\r\ngravitation under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the nebulæ over the heavens is even more irregular\r\nthan that of the stars. In some places they are so crowded together as\r\nscarcely to allow one to pass through the field of the telescope before\r\nanother appears, while in other parts hours elapse without a single\r\nnebula occurring. They are in general only to be seen with the best\r\ntelescopes, and are most abundant in a zone whose general direction is\r\nnot far from the hour circles 0^h and 12^h, and which crosses the\r\nMilky Way nearly at right angles. Where that nebulous zone passes over\r\nthe constellations Virgo, Coma Berenices, and the Great Bear, they are\r\nto be found in multitudes.\r\n\r\nThe nebulous system is nearly divided into two parts by the Milky Way.\r\nOne-third of the whole visible nebulous contents of the heavens forms a\r\nbroad irregular mass, interspersed with vacant intervals, which fills\r\nabout an eighth of the surface of the northern hemisphere. It occupies\r\nthe constellations Leo, Leo Minor, the body, tail, and hind legs of Ursa\r\nMajor, the nose of Camelopard, the point of the tail of Draco, Canis\r\nVenatica, Coma Berenices, the preceding leg of Boötes, and the head,\r\nwings, and shoulder of Virgo, which is the richest part. There is a\r\nlesser nebulous region in this hemisphere, but entirely separated from\r\nthe preceding, which occupies the chest and wing of Pegasus, the\r\nconstellations Pisces and Andromeda. If we could imagine the ring or\r\nzone of the Milky Way to encircle or coincide with the horizon, the\r\ngreat nebulous mass would form a canopy over head, descending down to a\r\nconsiderable distance on all sides, chiefly towards the north pole; and\r\nthe richest part, which is in Virgo, would then be directly over head in\r\nthe north pole of the Milky Way, that is in 12^h 47^m right ascension,\r\nand 64° north polar distance.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Magellanic clouds, there is a much greater\r\nuniformity in the distribution of the nebulæ in the southern hemisphere\r\nthan in the northern. They are separated by spaces of vacuity of greater\r\nor less dimensions. One of these barren regions extends for nearly\r\nfifteen degrees all around the south pole, and close on its border; the\r\nlesser of the Magellanic clouds occurs completely insulated; while the\r\ngreater Magellanic cloud is in connexion with something approaching to a\r\nzone of connected nebulous patches which extends along the back of\r\nDoradus, through a portion of Horologium and Eridanus, part of Fornix,\r\nand over the paws of Cetus to the equator, where it unites with the\r\nnebulous regions of Pisces.\r\n\r\nThe Magellanic clouds form two of the most striking features in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere; both of these nebulæ are visible to the unassisted\r\neye, being nearly of the same intensity as the brighter portions of the\r\nMilky Way; but the smaller is entirely effaced by moonlight, and the\r\nlarger nearly so. They are altogether unconnected with the Milky Way and\r\nwith one another. The Nubecula Major is far superior to the Nubecula\r\nMinor in every respect, though they are similar in internal structure.\r\nThe former consists of large tracts and ill-defined patches of\r\nirresolvable nebulæ, and nebulosity in every stage of resolution, up to\r\nperfectly resolved stars like the Milky Way; and also of regular and\r\nirregular nebulæ, properly so called; of globular clusters in every\r\nstage of resolvability; and of clustering groups sufficiently insulated\r\nand condensed to come under the designation of clusters of stars. Of\r\nthese the nebula known as Lacaille’s 30 Doradus is too remarkable to be\r\npassed over. It is very large, situate within the Nubecula Major, and\r\nconsists of an assemblage of nearly circular loops uniting in a centre,\r\nin or near which there is a circular black hole. In short, for the\r\nnumber and variety of the objects, there is nothing like this cloud.\r\nWithin an area of only forty-two square degrees, Sir John Herschel has\r\ndetermined the places, and registered 278 nebulæ and clusters of stars,\r\nwith fifty or sixty in outlying members immediately adjacent. Even the\r\nmost crowded parts of the stratum of Virgo, in the wing of that\r\nconstellation, or in Coma Berenices, offer nothing approaching to it. It\r\nis evident, from the intermixture of stars and unresolved nebulosity,\r\nwhich probably might be resolved with a higher optical power, that the\r\nnubeculæ are to be regarded as systems _sui generis_, to which there is\r\nnothing analogous in our hemisphere.\r\n\r\nNext to the Magellanic clouds the great nebula round η Argûs is one of\r\nthe most wonderful objects of the southern sky. It is situate in that\r\npart of the Milky Way which lies between the Centaur and the body of\r\nArgus, in the midst of one of those rich and brilliant masses, a\r\nsuccession of which is so curiously contrasted with the profoundly dark\r\nadjacent spaces, and surrounded by one of the most beautiful parts of\r\nthe southern heavens. Sir John Herschel says: “It would be impossible,\r\nby verbal description, to give any just idea of the capricious forms and\r\nirregular gradations of light affected by the different branches and\r\nappendages of this nebula. Nor is it easy for language to convey a full\r\nimpression of the beauty and sublimity of the spectacle it offers when\r\nviewed in a sweep, ushered in as it is by so glorious and innumerable a\r\nprocession of stars, to which it forms a sort of climax, justifying\r\nexpressions which, though I find them written in my journal in the\r\nexcitement of the moment, would be thought extravagant if transferred to\r\nthese pages. In fact, it is impossible for any one, with the least spark\r\nof astronomical enthusiasm about him, to pass soberly in review with a\r\npowerful telescope, and on a fine night, that portion of the southern\r\nsky which is comprised between the 6th and 13th degrees of right\r\nascension, and from 146° to 149° of north polar distance; such are the\r\nvariety and interest of the objects he will encounter, and such the\r\ndazzling richness of the starry ground on which they are represented to\r\nhis gaze.” In that portion of the sky there are many fine double\r\nstars—rich starry clusters; the elegant cluster of variously coloured\r\nstars round κ Crucis; a large planetary nebula with a satellite star;\r\nanother of a bright blue colour, exquisitely beautiful and unique; and,\r\nlastly, η Argûs itself, the most extraordinary instance of a variable\r\nstar in astronomical history.\r\n\r\nIt frequently occurred, during Sir John Herschel’s survey of the\r\nsouthern heavens, that some parts of the sky were noted for deeper\r\nblackness than others, and no stars could be seen; it frequently\r\nhappened that far from the Milky Way, or any large nebula or cluster of\r\nstars, there were some indications of very remote branches of the Milky\r\nWay, or of an independent sidereal system or systems, bearing a\r\nresemblance to such branches. These were indicated by an exceedingly\r\ndelicate and uniform dotting or stippling of the sky by points of light\r\ntoo small to admit of any one of them being steadily and fixedly viewed,\r\nand too numerous to be counted even if possible to view them. The truth\r\nof this existence was felt at the moment of observation; but the\r\nconviction, though often renewed, was not permanent. The places where\r\nthese appearances occurred are given, in order that those who wish to\r\nverify them may have it in their power.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief account of a very few of the discoveries contained in\r\nSir John Herschel’s great work on the Nebulæ and other Phenomena of the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere,—a work which will rise in estimation with the lapse\r\nof years. No doubt the form and internal structure of many of these\r\nnebulæ will be changed by telescopes of higher power; but as the places\r\nof the leading phenomena have been determined, the date of that great\r\nwork may be regarded as the epoch of nebular time whence the relative\r\nchanges that take place in the most distant regions of the universe will\r\nbe estimated for ages to come; and in the inimitable writings of the\r\nhighly gifted father and son the reader will find these subjects treated\r\nof in a style worthy of it and of them. Of late years the excellence of\r\nthe instruments, and still more of the astronomers, in the foreign\r\nobservatories, have aided the progress of sidereal astronomy immensely.\r\nNor has it been cultivated with less success in our home and colonial\r\nestablishments: certainly one of the most remarkable features of the\r\ntimes is the number of private observatories, built and furnished with\r\nthe best instruments by private gentlemen, whose zeal has been rewarded\r\nby eminent success in all departments of the science. (N. 236.)\r\n\r\nSo numerous are the objects which meet our view in the heavens, that we\r\ncannot imagine a point of space where some light would not strike the\r\neye;—innumerable stars, thousands of double and multiple systems,\r\nclusters in one blaze with their tens of thousands of stars, and the\r\nnebulæ amazing us by the strangeness of their forms and the\r\nincomprehensibility of their nature, till at last, from the limit of our\r\nsenses, even these thin and airy phantoms vanish in the distance. If\r\nsuch remote bodies shone by reflected light, we should be unconscious of\r\ntheir existence. Each star must then be a sun, and may be presumed to\r\nhave its system of planets, satellites, and comets, like our own; and,\r\nfor aught we know, myriads of bodies may be wandering in space unseen by\r\nus, of whose nature we can form no idea, and still less of the part they\r\nperform in the economy of the universe. Even in our own system, or at\r\nits farthest limits, minute bodies may be revolving like the telescopic\r\nplanets, which are so small that their masses have hitherto been\r\ninappreciable, and there may be many still smaller. Nor is this an\r\nunwarranted presumption; many such do come within the sphere of the\r\nearth’s attraction, are ignited by the velocity with which they pass\r\nthrough the atmosphere, but leave no residuum. These, which are known as\r\nfalling stars and meteors, are periodical; but that is by no means the\r\ncase with aërolites, which are also ignited by the sudden condensation\r\nof the air on entering our atmosphere, and are precipitated in solid\r\nmasses with such violence on the earth’s surface that they are often\r\ndeeply buried in the ground.\r\n\r\nThe fall of meteoric stones is much more frequent than is generally\r\nbelieved. Hardly a year passes without some instances occurring; and, if\r\nit be considered that only a small part of the earth is inhabited, it\r\nmay be presumed that numbers fall in the ocean, or on the uninhabited\r\npart of the land, unseen by man. They are sometimes of great magnitude;\r\nthe volume of several has exceeded that of the planet Ceres, which is\r\nabout 70 miles in diameter. One which passed within 25 miles of us was\r\nestimated to weigh about 600,000 tons, and to move with a velocity of\r\nabout 20 miles in a second; a fragment of it alone reached the earth.\r\nThe obliquity of the descent of meteorites, the peculiar substances they\r\nare composed of, and the explosion accompanying their fall, show that\r\nthey are foreign to our system; but whence derived is still a mystery.\r\n\r\nShooting stars and meteors burst from the clear azure sky, and, darting\r\nalong the heavens, are extinguished without leaving any residuum except\r\na vapour-like smoke, and generally without noise. Their parallax shows\r\nthem to be very high in the atmosphere, sometimes even beyond its\r\nsupposed limit, and the direction of their motion is for the most part\r\ndiametrically opposite to the motion of the earth in its orbit. The\r\nastonishing multitudes of shooting stars and fire-balls that have\r\nappeared at stated periods over different parts of the globe, warrant\r\nthe conclusion that there is either a nebula or that there are myriads\r\nof bodies revolving in groups round the sun which only become visible\r\nwhen inflamed by entering our atmosphere.\r\n\r\nOne of these nebulæ or groups seems to meet the earth in its annual\r\nrevolution on the 12th and 13th of November.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 12th of November, 1799, thousands of shooting\r\nstars, mixed with large meteors, illuminated the heavens for many hours\r\nover the whole continent of America, from Brazil to Labrador: it\r\nextended to Greenland, and even Germany. Meteoric showers were seen off\r\nthe coast of Spain, and in the Ohio country, on the morning of the 13th\r\nof November, 1831; and during many hours on the morning of the 13th\r\nNovember, 1832, prodigious multitudes of shooting stars and meteors fell\r\nat Mocha on the Red Sea, in the Atlantic, in Switzerland, and at many\r\nplaces in England. But by much the most splendid meteoric shower on\r\nrecord began at nine o’clock in the evening of the 12th of November,\r\n1833, and lasted till sunrise next morning. It extended from Niagara and\r\nthe northern lakes of America to the south of Jamaica, and from 61° of\r\nlongitude in the Atlantic to 100° of longitude in central Mexico.\r\nShooting stars and meteors, of the apparent size of Jupiter, Venus, and\r\neven the full moon, darted in myriads towards the horizon, as if every\r\nstar in the heavens had started from their spheres. They are described\r\nas having been frequent as flakes of snow in a snow-storm, and to have\r\nbeen seen with equal brilliancy over the greater part of the continent\r\nof North America.\r\n\r\nThose who witnessed this grand spectacle were surprised to see that\r\nevery one of the luminous bodies, without exception, moved in lines\r\nwhich converged in one point in the heavens: none of them started from\r\nthat point; but their paths, when traced backwards, met in it like rays\r\nin a focus, and the manner of their fall showed that they descended from\r\nit in nearly parallel straight lines towards the earth.\r\n\r\nBy far the most extraordinary part of the whole phenomenon is, that this\r\nradiant point was observed to remain stationary near the star γ Leonis\r\nfor more than two hours and a half, which proved the source of the\r\nmeteoric shower to be altogether independent of the earth’s rotation,\r\nand its parallax showed it to be far above the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAs a body could not be actually at rest in that position, the group or\r\nnebula must either have been moving round the earth or the sun. Had it\r\nbeen moving about the earth, the course of the meteors would have been\r\ntangential to its surface; whereas they fell almost perpendicularly, so\r\nthat the earth in its annual revolution must have met with the group.\r\nThe bodies or the parts of the nebula that were nearest must have been\r\nattracted towards the earth by its gravity, and, as they were estimated\r\nto move at the rate of fourteen miles in a second, they must have taken\r\nfire on entering our atmosphere, and been consumed in their passage\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\nAs all the circumstances of the phenomena were similar on the same day\r\nand during the same hours in 1832, and as extraordinary flights of\r\nshooting stars were seen at many places both in Europe and America on\r\nthe 13th of November, 1834, 1835, and 1836, tending also from a fixed\r\npoint in the constellation Leo, it has been conjectured, with much\r\napparent probability, that this nebula or group of bodies performs its\r\nrevolution round the sun in a period of about 182 days, in an elliptical\r\norbit, whose major axis is 119 millions of miles; and that its aphelion\r\ndistance, where it comes in contact with the earth’s atmosphere, is\r\nabout 95 millions of miles, or nearly the same with the mean distance of\r\nthe earth from the sun. This body must have met with disturbances after\r\n1799, which prevented it from encountering the earth for 32 years, and\r\nit may again deviate from its path from the same cause.\r\n\r\nIt is now well ascertained that great showers of shooting stars occur\r\nalso on the 12th of August, whose point of divergence is β\r\nCamelopardali, so that the earth’s atmosphere comes into contact with a\r\nzone of these small bodies twice in the year. By a systematic series of\r\nobservations, MM. Benzenberg and Brand have clearly made out that the\r\nheights at which the falling stars appear and vanish vary from 16 miles\r\nto 140, and their velocities from 18 to 36 miles in a second, velocities\r\nso great as certainly to indicate a planetary revolution round the sun.\r\nAs shooting stars are seen almost every night when the sky is clear, Sir\r\nJohn Lubbock has thought it probable that some of these bodies may have\r\ncome so near, that the attraction of the earth has overcome that of the\r\nsun, and caused them to revolve as satellites round it. Should that be\r\nthe case, they might shine by the reflected light of the sun, and\r\nsuddenly cease to be visible on entering the earth’s shadow. The\r\nsplitting of the falling stars like a rocket, and the trains of light,\r\nmay be accounted for by supposing the stars to graze the surface of the\r\nshadow before being eclipsed; and the disappearance would be more or\r\nless rapid according to the breadth of the penumbra traversed. The\r\ncalculations of M. Petit, Director of the Observatory of Toulouse, not\r\nonly render probable the existence of small satellites, but tend to\r\nestablish the identity of a body revolving round the earth in three\r\nhours and twenty minutes, at a distance of 5000 miles above its surface.\r\nIt is evident that in this case the same satellite would be seen very\r\noften, and a very few would be sufficient to account for their nightly\r\nappearance. It is possible, however, that some shooting stars may belong\r\nto one class, and some to the other, since one group may be revolving\r\nabout the sun, and another round the earth. In the case of a satellite\r\nshooting star, geometry furnishes the means of ascertaining its exact\r\ndistance from the spectator, or from the centre of the earth, if the\r\ntime and place of its disappearance be known with regard to the\r\nneighbouring stars. Since the falling stars are consumed in the\r\natmosphere, their masses must be small, but it is possible that\r\noccasionally one may be large enough to arrive at the surface of the\r\nearth as an aërolite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SECTION XXXVII.\r\n\r\nDiffusion of Matter through Space—Gravitation—Its Velocity—Simplicity of\r\n  its Laws—Gravitation independent of the Magnitude and Distances of the\r\n  Bodies—Not impeded by the intervention of any Substance—Its Intensity\r\n  invariable—General Laws—Recapitulation and Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE known quantity of matter bears a very small proportion to the\r\nimmensity of space. Large as the bodies are, the distances which\r\nseparate them are immeasurably greater; but, as design is manifest in\r\nevery part of creation, it is probable that, if the various systems in\r\nthe universe had been nearer to one another, their mutual disturbances\r\nwould have been inconsistent with the harmony and stability of the\r\nwhole. It is clear that space is not pervaded by atmospheric air of such\r\ndensity as that we breathe, since its resistance would long ere this\r\nhave arrested the motion of the planets: it certainly is not a void, but\r\nreplete with a medium possibly in itself electric or magnetic, but at\r\nall events capable of transmitting light, heat, magnetism, gravity, and\r\nprobably influences of which we can form no idea.\r\n\r\nWhatever the laws may be that obtain in the more distant regions of\r\ncreation, we are assured that one alone regulates the motions, not only\r\nof our own system, but also of the binary systems of the fixed stars;\r\nand, as general laws form the ultimate object of philosophical research,\r\nwe cannot conclude these remarks without considering the nature of\r\ngravitation—that extraordinary power whose effects we have been\r\nendeavouring to trace through some of their mazes. It was at one time\r\nimagined that the acceleration in the moon’s mean motion was occasioned\r\nby the successive transmission of the gravitating force. It has been\r\nproved that, in order to produce this effect, its velocity must be about\r\nfifty millions of times greater than that of light, which flies at the\r\nrate of 192,000 miles in a second. Its action, even at the distance of\r\nthe sun, may therefore be regarded as instantaneous; yet, remote as the\r\nfixed stars are, the solar gravitation must have some influence on the\r\nnearest of them, as, for example, α Centauri, which is only 20,602 times\r\nthe radius of the earth’s orbit from the sun, while La Place has\r\ncomputed that the solar gravitation extends a hundred millions of times\r\nfarther than the semidiameter of the terrestrial orbit. Possibly the\r\nstar dust in the Milky Way may be beyond, or on the verge of, that\r\nenormous limit; yet it is very unlikely that either the sun, or any of\r\nthe stars which form the great cluster to which we belong, should be\r\nunconnected bodies.\r\n\r\nThe curves in which the celestial bodies move by the force of\r\ngravitation are only lines of the second order. The attraction of\r\nspheroids, according to any other law of force than that of gravitation,\r\nwould be much more complicated; and, as it is easy to prove that matter\r\nmight have been moved according to an infinite variety of laws, it may\r\nbe concluded that gravitation must have been selected by Divine Wisdom\r\nout of an infinity of others, as being the most simple, and that which\r\ngives the greatest stability to the celestial motions.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular result of the simplicity of the laws of nature, which\r\nadmit only of the observation and comparison of ratios, that the\r\ngravitation and theory of the motions of the celestial bodies are\r\nindependent of their absolute magnitudes and distances. Consequently, if\r\nall the bodies of the solar system, their mutual distances, and their\r\nvelocities, were to diminish proportionally, they would describe curves\r\nin all respects similar to those in which they now move; and the system\r\nmight be successively reduced to the smallest sensible dimensions, and\r\nstill exhibit the same appearances.\r\n\r\nThe action of the gravitating force is not impeded by the intervention\r\neven of the densest substances. If the attraction of the sun for the\r\ncentre of the earth, and of the hemisphere diametrically opposite to\r\nhim, were diminished by a difficulty in penetrating the interposed\r\nmatter, the tides would be more obviously affected. Its attraction is\r\nthe same also, whatever the substances of the celestial bodies may be;\r\nfor, if the action of the sun upon the earth differed by a millionth\r\npart from his action upon the moon, the difference would occasion a\r\nperiodical variation in the moon’s parallax, whose maximum would be the\r\n1/15 of a second, and also a variation in her longitude amounting to\r\nseveral seconds—a supposition proved to be impossible by the agreement\r\nof theory with observation. Thus all matter is pervious to gravitation,\r\nand is equally attracted by it.\r\n\r\nGravitation is a feeble force, vastly inferior to electric action,\r\nchemical affinity, and cohesion; yet, as far as human knowledge extends,\r\nthe intensity of gravitation has never varied within the limits of the\r\nsolar system; nor does even analogy lead us to expect that it should: on\r\nthe contrary, there is every reason to be assured that the great laws of\r\nthe universe are immutable, like their Author. Nor can we suppose the\r\nstructure of the globe alone to be exempt from the universal fiat of\r\ngeneral laws, though ages may pass before the changes it has undergone,\r\nor that are now in progress, can be referred to existing causes with the\r\nsame certainty with which the motions of the planets, and all their\r\nperiodic and secular variations, are referable to the law of\r\ngravitation. The traces of extreme antiquity perpetually occurring to\r\nthe geologist give that information, as to the origin of things, in vain\r\nlooked for in the other parts of the universe. They date the beginning\r\nof time with regard to our system, since there is ground to believe that\r\nthe formation of the earth was contemporaneous with that of the rest of\r\nthe planets; but they show that creation is the work of Him with whom “a\r\nthousand years are as one day, and one day as a thousand years.”\r\n\r\nIn the work now brought to a conclusion, it has been necessary to select\r\nfrom the whole circle of the sciences a few of the most obvious of those\r\nproximate links which connect them together, and to pass over\r\ninnumerable cases both of evident and occult alliance. Any one branch\r\ntraced through its ramifications would alone have occupied a volume; it\r\nis hoped, nevertheless, that the view here given will suffice to show\r\nthe extent to which a consideration of the reciprocal influence of even\r\na few of these subjects may ultimately lead. It thus appears that the\r\ntheory of dynamics, founded upon terrestrial phenomena, is indispensable\r\nfor acquiring a knowledge of the revolutions of the celestial bodies and\r\ntheir reciprocal influences. The motions of the satellites are affected\r\nby the forms of their primaries, and the figures of the planets\r\nthemselves depend upon their rotations. The symmetry of their internal\r\nstructure proves the stability of these rotatory motions, and the\r\nimmutability of the length of the day, which furnishes an invariable\r\nstandard of time; and the actual size of the terrestrial spheroid\r\naffords the means of ascertaining the dimensions of the solar system,\r\nand provides an invariable foundation for a system of weights and\r\nmeasures. The mutual attraction of the celestial bodies disturbs the\r\nfluids at their surfaces, whence the theory of the tides and of the\r\noscillations of the atmosphere. The density and elasticity of the air,\r\nvarying with every alternation of temperature, lead to the consideration\r\nof barometrical changes, the measurement of heights, and capillary\r\nattraction; and the doctrine of sound, including the theory of music, is\r\nto be referred to the small undulations of the aërial medium. A\r\nknowledge of the action of matter upon light is requisite for tracing\r\nthe curved path of its rays through the atmosphere, by which the true\r\nplaces of distant objects are determined, whether in the heavens or on\r\nthe earth. By this we learn the nature and properties of the sunbeam,\r\nthe mode of its propagation through the ethereal medium, or in the\r\ninterior of material bodies, and the origin of colour. By the eclipses\r\nof Jupiter’s satellites the velocity of light is ascertained; and that\r\nvelocity, in the aberration of the fixed stars, furnishes a direct proof\r\nof the real motion of the earth (N. 237). The effects of the invisible\r\nrays of the spectrum are immediately connected with chemical action; and\r\nheat, forming a part of the solar ray, so essential to animated and\r\ninanimated existence, is too important an agent in the economy of\r\ncreation not to hold a principal place in the connexion of physical\r\nsciences; whence follows its distribution in the interior and over the\r\nsurface of the globe, its power on the geological convulsions of our\r\nplanet, its influence on the atmosphere and on climate, and its effects\r\non vegetable and animal life, evinced in the localities of organized\r\nbeings on the earth, in the waters, and in the air. The correlation\r\nbetween molecular and chemical action, light, heat, electricity, and\r\nmagnetism, is continually becoming more perfect, and there is every\r\nreason to believe that these different modes of force, as well as\r\ngravity itself, will ultimately be found to merge in one great and\r\nuniversal power. Many more instances might be given in illustration of\r\nthe immediate connexion of the physical sciences, most of which are\r\nunited still more closely by the common bond of analysis, which is daily\r\nextending its empire, and will ultimately embrace almost every subject\r\nin nature in its formulæ.\r\n\r\nThese formulæ, emblematic of Omniscience, condense into a few symbols\r\nthe immutable laws of the universe. This mighty instrument of human\r\npower itself originates in the primitive constitution of the human mind,\r\nand rests upon a few fundamental axioms, which have eternally existed in\r\nHim who implanted them in the breast of man when He created him after\r\nHis own image.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 1, page 2. _Diameter._ A straight line passing through the centre,\r\nand terminated both ways by the sides or surface of a figure, such as of\r\na circle or sphere. In fig. 1, q Q, N S, are diameters.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 2, p. 2. _Mathematical and mechanical sciences._ Mathematics teach\r\nthe laws of number and quantity; mechanics treat of the equilibrium and\r\nmotion of bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 3, p. 2. _Analysis_ is a series of reasoning conducted by signs or\r\nsymbols of the quantities whose relations form the subject of inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 4, p. 3. _Oscillations_ are movements to and fro, like the swinging\r\nof the pendulum of a clock, or waves in water. The tides are\r\noscillations of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 5, p. 3. _Gravitation._ _Gravity_ is the reciprocal attraction of\r\nmatter on matter; _gravitation_ is the difference between gravity and\r\nthe centrifugal force induced by the velocity of rotation or revolution.\r\nSensible gravity, or weight, is a particular instance of gravitation. It\r\nis the force which causes substances to fall to the surface of the\r\nearth, and which retains the celestial bodies in their orbits. Its\r\nintensity increases as the squares of the distance decrease.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 6, p. 4. _Particles of matter_ are the indefinitely small or\r\nultimate atoms into which matter is believed to be divisible. Their form\r\nis unknown; but, though too small to be visible, they must have\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 7, p. 4. _A hollow sphere._ A hollow ball, like a bomb-shell. A\r\nsphere is a ball or solid body, such, that all lines drawn from its\r\ncentre to its surface are equal. They are called radii, and every line\r\npassing through the centre and terminated both ways by the surface is a\r\ndiameter, which is consequently equal to twice the radius. In fig. 3, Q\r\nq or N S is a diameter, and C Q, C N are radii. A great circle of the\r\nsphere has the same centre with the sphere as the circles Q E q d and Q\r\nN q S. The circle A B is a lesser circle of the sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 8, p. 4. _Concentric hollow spheres._ Shells, or hollow spheres,\r\nhaving the same centre, like the coats of an onion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 1._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 9, p. 4. _Spheroid._ A solid body, which sometimes has the shape of\r\nan orange, as in fig. 1; it is then called an oblate spheroid, because\r\nit is flattened at the poles N and S. Such is the form of the earth and\r\nplanets. When, on the contrary, it is drawn out at the poles like an\r\negg, as in fig. 2, it is called a prolate spheroid. It is evident that\r\nin both these solids the radii C q, C a, C N, &c., are generally\r\nunequal; whereas in the sphere they are all equal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 2._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 10, p. 4. _Centre of gravity._ A point in every body, which if\r\nsupported, the body will remain at rest in whatever position it may be\r\nplaced. About that point all the parts exactly balance one another. The\r\ncelestial bodies attract each other as if each were condensed into a\r\nsingle particle situate in the centre of gravity, or the particle\r\nsituate in the centre of gravity of each may be regarded as possessing\r\nthe resultant power of the innumerable oblique forces which constitute\r\nthe whole attraction of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 11, pp. 4, 6. _Poles and equator._ Let fig. 1 or 3 represent the\r\nearth, C its centre, N C S the axis of rotation, or the imaginary line\r\nabout which it performs its daily revolution. Then N and S are the north\r\nand south poles, and the great circle q E Q, which divides the earth\r\ninto two equal parts, is the equator. The earth is flattened at the\r\npoles, fig. 1, the equatorial diameter, q Q, exceeding the polar\r\ndiameter, N S, by about 26-1/2 miles. Lesser circles, A B G, which are\r\nparallel to the equator, are circles or parallels of latitude, which is\r\nestimated in degrees, minutes, and seconds, north and south of the\r\nequator, every place in the same parallel having the same latitude.\r\nGreenwich is in the parallel of 51° 28ʹ 40ʺ. Thus terrestrial latitude\r\nis the angular distance between the direction of a plumb-line at any\r\nplace and the plane of the equator. Lines such as N Q S, N G E S, fig.\r\n3, are called meridians; all the places in any one of these lines have\r\nnoon at the same instant. The meridian of Greenwich has been chosen by\r\nthe British as the origin of terrestrial longitude, which is estimated\r\nin degrees, minutes, and seconds, east and west of that line. If N G E S\r\nbe the meridian of Greenwich, the position of any place, B, is\r\ndetermined, when its latitude, Q C B, and its longitude, E C Q, are\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 3._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 12, p. 4. _Mean quantities_ are such as are intermediate between\r\nothers that are greater and less. The mean of any number of unequal\r\nquantities is equal to their sum divided by their number. For instance,\r\nthe mean between two unequal quantities is equal to half their sum.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 13, p. 4. _A certain mean latitude._ The attraction of a sphere on\r\nan external body is the same as if its mass were collected into one\r\nheavy particle in its centre of gravity, and the intensity of its\r\nattraction diminishes as the square of its distance from the external\r\nbody increases. But the attraction of a spheroid, fig. 1, on an external\r\nbody at m in the plane of its equator, E Q, is greater, and its\r\nattraction on the same body when at mʹ in the axis N S less, than if it\r\nwere a sphere. Therefore, in both cases, the force deviates from the\r\nexact law of gravity. This deviation arises from the protuberant matter\r\nat the equator; and, as it diminishes towards the poles, so does the\r\nattractive force of the spheroid. But there is one mean latitude, where\r\nthe attraction of a spheroid is the same as if it were a sphere. It is a\r\npart of the spheroid intermediate between the equator and the pole. In\r\nthat latitude the square of the sine is equal to 1/3 of the equatorial\r\nradius.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 14, p. 4. _Mean distance._ The mean distance of a planet from the\r\ncentre of the sun, or of a satellite from the centre of its planet, is\r\nequal to half the sum of its greatest and least distances, and,\r\nconsequently, is equal to half the major axis of its orbit. For example,\r\nlet P Q A D, fig. 6, be the orbit or path of the moon or of a planet;\r\nthen P A is the major axis, C the centre, and C S is equal to C F. Now,\r\nsince the earth or the sun is supposed to be in the point S according as\r\nP D A Q is regarded as the orbit of the moon or that of a planet, S A, S\r\nP are the greatest and least distances. But half the sum of S A and S P\r\nis equal to half of A P, the major axis of the orbit. When the body is\r\nat Q or D, it is at its mean distance from S, for S Q, S D, are each\r\nequal to C P, half the major axis by the nature of the curve.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 15, p. 4. _Mean radius of the earth._ The distance from the centre\r\nto the surface of the earth, regarded as a sphere. It is intermediate\r\nbetween the distances of the centre of the earth from the pole and from\r\nthe equator.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 16, p. 5. _Ratio._ The relation which one quantity bears to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 17, p. 5. _Square of moon’s distance._ In order to avoid large\r\nnumbers, the mean radius of the earth is taken for unity: then the mean\r\ndistance of the moon is expressed by 60; and the square of that number\r\nis 3600, or 60 times 60.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 4_]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 18, p. 5. _Centrifugal force._ The force with which a revolving\r\nbody tends to fly from the centre of motion: a sling tends to fly from\r\nthe hand in consequence of the centrifugal force. A tangent is a\r\nstraight line touching a curved line in one point without cutting it, as\r\nm T, fig. 4. The direction of the centrifugal force is in the tangent to\r\nthe curved line or path in which the body revolves, and its intensity\r\nincreases with the angular swing of the body, and with its distance from\r\nthe centre of motion. As the orbit of the moon does not differ much from\r\na circle, let it be represented by m d g h, fig. 4, the earth being in\r\nC. The centrifugal force arising from the velocity of the moon in her\r\norbit balances the attraction of the earth. By their joint action, the\r\nmoon moves through the arc m n during the time that she would fly off in\r\nthe tangent m T by the action of the centrifugal force alone, or fall\r\nthrough m p by the earth’s attraction alone. T n, the deflection from\r\nthe tangent, is parallel and equal to m p, the versed sine of the arc m\r\nn, supposed to be moved over by the moon in a second, and therefore so\r\nvery small that it may be regarded as a straight line. T n, or m p, is\r\nthe space the moon would fall through in the first second of her descent\r\nto the earth, were she not retained in her orbit by her centrifugal\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 19, p. 5. _Action and reaction._ When motion is communicated by\r\ncollision or pressure, the action of the body which strikes is returned\r\nwith equal force by the body which receives the blow. The pressure of a\r\nhand on a table is resisted with an equal and contrary force. This\r\nnecessarily follows from the impenetrability of matter, a property by\r\nwhich no two particles of matter can occupy the same identical portion\r\nof space at the same time. When motion is communicated without apparent\r\ncontact, as in gravitation, attraction, and repulsion, the quantity of\r\nmotion gained by the one body is exactly equal to that lost by the\r\nother, but in a contrary direction; a circumstance known by experience\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 20, p. 5. _Projected._ A body is projected when it is thrown: a\r\nball fired from a gun is projected; it is therefore called a projectile.\r\nBut the word has also another meaning. A line, surface, or solid body,\r\nis said to be projected upon a plane, when parallel straight lines are\r\ndrawn from every point of it to the plane. The figure so traced upon a\r\nplane is a projection. The projection of a terrestrial object is\r\ntherefore its daylight shadow, since the sun’s rays are sensibly\r\nparallel.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 21, p. 5. _Space._ The boundless region which contains all\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 5._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 6._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 22, pp. 5, 11. _Conic sections._ Lines formed by any plane cutting\r\na cone. A cone is a solid figure, like a sugar-loaf, fig. 5, of which A\r\nis the apex, A D the axis, and the plane B E C F the base. The axis may\r\nor may not be perpendicular to the base, and the base may be a circle,\r\nor any other curved line. When the axis is perpendicular to the base,\r\nthe solid is a right cone. If a right cone with a circular base be cut\r\nat right angles to the base by a plane passing through the apex, the\r\nsection will be a triangle. If the cone be cut through both sides by a\r\nplane parallel to the base, the section will be a circle. If the cone be\r\ncut slanting quite through both sides, the section will be an ellipse,\r\nfig. 6. If the cone be cut parallel to one of the sloping sides as A B,\r\nthe section will be a parabola, fig. 7. And if the plane cut only one\r\nside of the cone, and be not parallel to the other, the section will be\r\na hyperbola, fig. 8. Thus there are five conic sections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 7._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 8._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 23, p. 5. _Inverse square of distance._ The attraction of one body\r\nfor another at the distance of two miles is four times less than at the\r\ndistance of one mile; at three miles, it is nine times less than at one;\r\nat four miles, it is sixteen times less, and so on. That is, the\r\ngravitating force decreases in intensity as the squares of the distance\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 24, p. 5. _Ellipse._ One of the conic sections, fig. 6. An ellipse\r\nmay be drawn by fixing the ends of a string to two points, S and F, in a\r\nsheet of paper, and then carrying the point of a pencil round in the\r\nloop of the string kept stretched, the length of the string being\r\ngreater than the distance between the two points. The points S and F are\r\ncalled the foci, C the centre, S C or C F the excentricity, A P the\r\nmajor axis, Q D the minor axis, and P S the focal distance. It is\r\nevident that, the less the excentricity C S, the nearer does the ellipse\r\napproach to a circle; and from the construction it is clear that the\r\nlength of the string S m F is equal to the major axis P A. If T t be a\r\ntangent to the ellipse at m, then the angle T m S is equal to the angle\r\nt m F; and, as this is true for every point in the ellipse, it follows\r\nthat, in an elliptical reflecting surface, rays of light or sound coming\r\nfrom one focus S will be reflected by the surface to the other focus F,\r\nsince the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection by the\r\ntheories of light and sound.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 25, p. 5. _Periodic time._ The time in which a planet or comet\r\nperforms a revolution round the sun, or a satellite about its planet.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 26, p. 5. Kepler discovered three laws in the planetary motions by\r\nwhich the principle of gravitation is established:—1st law, That the\r\nradii vectores of the planets and comets describe areas proportional to\r\nthe time.—Let fig. 9 be the orbit of a planet; then, supposing the\r\nspaces or areas P S p, p S a, a S b, &c., equal to one another, the\r\nradius vector S P, which is the line joining the centres of the sun and\r\nplanet, passes over these equal spaces in equal times; that is, if the\r\nline S P passes to S p in one day, it will come to S a in two days, to S\r\nb in three days, and so on. 2nd law, That the orbits or paths of the\r\nplanets and comets are conic sections, having the sun in one of their\r\nfoci. The orbits of the planets and satellites are curves like fig. 6 or\r\n9, called ellipses, having the sun in the focus S. Several comets are\r\nknown to move in ellipses; but the greater part seem to move in\r\nparabolas, fig. 7, having the sun in S, though it is probable that they\r\nreally move in very long flat ellipses; others appear to move in\r\nhyperbolas, like fig. 8. The third law is, that the squares of the\r\nperiodic times of the planets are proportional to the cubes of their\r\nmean distances from the sun. The square of a number is that number\r\nmultiplied by itself, and the cube of a number is that number twice\r\nmultiplied by itself. For example, the squares of the numbers 2, 3, 4,\r\n&c., are 4, 9, 16, &c., but their cubes are 8, 27, 64, &c. Then the\r\nsquares of the numbers representing the periodic times of two planets\r\nare to one another as the cubes of the numbers representing their mean\r\ndistances from the sun. So that, three of these quantities being known,\r\nthe other may be found by the rule of three. The mean distances are\r\nmeasured in miles or terrestrial radii, and the periodic times are\r\nestimated in years, days, and parts of a day. Kepler’s laws extend to\r\nthe satellites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 9._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 27, p. 5. _Mass._ The quantity of matter in a given bulk. It is\r\nproportional to the density and volume or bulk conjointly.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 28, p. 5. _Gravitation proportional to mass._ But for the\r\nresistance of the air, all bodies would fall to the ground in equal\r\ntimes. In fact, a hundred equal particles of matter at equal distances\r\nfrom the surface of the earth would fall to the ground in parallel\r\nstraight lines with equal rapidity, and no change whatever would take\r\nplace in the circumstances of their descent, if 99 of them were united\r\nin one solid mass; for the solid mass and the single particle would\r\ntouch the ground at the same instant, were it not for the resistance of\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 29, p. 5. _Primary_ signifies, in astronomy, the planet about which\r\na satellite revolves. The earth is primary to the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 30, p. 6. _Rotation._ Motion round an axis, real or imaginary.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 31, p. 7. _Compression of a spheroid._ The flattening at the poles.\r\nIt is equal to the difference between the greatest and least diameters,\r\ndivided by the greatest, these quantities being expressed in some\r\nstandard measure, as miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 32, p. 7. SATELLITES. Small bodies revolving about some of the\r\nplanets. The moon is a satellite to the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 33, p. 7. _Nutation._ A nodding motion in the earth’s axis while in\r\nrotation, similar to that observed in the spinning of a top. It is\r\nproduced by the attraction of the sun and moon on the protuberant matter\r\nat the terrestrial equator.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 34, p. 7. _Axis of rotation._ The line, real or imaginary, about\r\nwhich a body revolves. The axis of the earth’s rotation is that\r\ndiameter, or imaginary line, passing through the centre and both poles.\r\nFig. 1 being the earth, N S is the axis of rotation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 35, p. 7. _Nutation of lunar orbit._ The action of the bulging\r\nmatter at the earth’s equator on the moon occasions a variation in the\r\ninclination of the lunar orbit to the plane of the ecliptic. Suppose the\r\nplane N p n, fig. 13, to be the orbit of the moon, and N m n the plane\r\nof the ecliptic, the earth’s action on the moon causes the angle p N m\r\nto become less or greater than its mean state. The nutation in the lunar\r\norbit is the reaction of the nutation in the earth’s axis.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 36, p. 7. _Translated._ Carried forward in space.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 37, p. 7. _Force proportional to velocity._ Since a force is\r\nmeasured by its effect, the motions of the bodies of the solar system\r\namong themselves would be the same whether the system be at rest or not.\r\nThe real motion of a person walking the deck of a ship at sea is\r\ncompounded of his own motion and that of the ship, yet each takes place\r\nindependently of the other. We walk about as if the earth were at rest,\r\nthough it has the double motion of rotation on its axis and revolution\r\nround the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 38, p. 8. _Tangent._ A straight line which touches a curved line in\r\none point without cutting it. In fig. 4, m T is tangent to the curve in\r\nthe point m. In a circle the tangent is at right angles to the radius, C\r\nm.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 39, p. 8. _Motion in an elliptical orbit._ A planet m, fig. 6,\r\nmoves round the sun at S in an ellipse P D A Q, in consequence of two\r\nforces, one urging it in the direction of the tangent m T, and another\r\npulling it towards the sun in the direction m S. Its velocity, which is\r\ngreatest at P, decreases throughout the arc to P D A to A, where it is\r\nleast, and increases continually as it moves along the arc A Q P till it\r\ncomes to P again. The whole force producing the elliptical motion varies\r\ninversely as the square of the distance. See note 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 40, p. 8. _Radii vectores._ Imaginary lines adjoining the centre of\r\nthe sun and the centre of a planet or comet, or the centres of a planet\r\nand its satellite. In the circle, the radii are all equal; but in an\r\nellipse, fig. 6, the radius vector S A is greater, and S P less than all\r\nthe others. The radii vectores S Q, S D, are equal to C A or C P, half\r\nthe major axis P A, and consequently equal to the mean distance. A\r\nplanet is at its mean distance from the sun when in the points Q and D.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 41, p. 8. _Equal areas in equal times._ See Kepler’s 1st law, in\r\nnote 26, p. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 42, p. 8. _Major axis._ The line P A, fig. 6 or 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 43, p. 8. _If the planet described a circle, &c._ The motion of a\r\nplanet about the sun, in a circle A B P, fig. 10, whose radius C A is\r\nequal to the planet’s mean distance from him, would be equable, that is,\r\nits velocity, or speed, would always be the same. Whereas, if it moved\r\nin the ellipse A Q P, its speed would be continually varying, by note\r\n39; but its motion is such, that the time elapsing between its departure\r\nfrom P and its return to that point again would be the same whether it\r\nmoved in the circle or in the ellipse; for these curves coincide in the\r\npoints P and A.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 44, p. 8. _True motion._ The motion of a body in its real orbit P D\r\nA Q, fig. 10.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 10._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 45, p. 9. _Mean motion._ Equable motion in a circle P E A B, fig.\r\n10, at the mean distance C P or C m, in the time that the body would\r\naccomplish a revolution in its elliptical orbit P D A Q.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 46, p. 9. _The equinox._ Fig. 11 represents the celestial sphere,\r\nand C its centre, where the earth is supposed to be. q ♈ Q ♎ is the\r\nequinoctial or great circle, traced in the starry heavens by an\r\nimaginary extension of the plane of the terrestrial equator, and E ♈ e ♎\r\nis the ecliptic, or apparent path of the sun round the earth. ♈ ♎, the\r\nintersection of these two planes, is the line of the equinoxes; ♈ is the\r\nvernal equinox, and ♎ the autumnal. When the sun is in these points, the\r\ndays and nights are equal. They are distant from one another by a\r\nsemicircle, or two right angles. The points E and e are the solstices,\r\nwhere the sun is at his greatest distance from the equinoctial. The\r\nequinoctial is everywhere ninety degrees distant from its poles N and S,\r\nwhich are two points diametrically opposite to one another, where the\r\naxis of the earth’s rotation, if prolonged, would meet the heavens. The\r\nnorthern celestial pole N is within 1° 24ʹ of the pole star. As the\r\nlatitude of any place on the surface of the earth is equal to the height\r\nof the pole above the horizon, it is easily determined by observation.\r\nThe ecliptic E ♈ e ♎ is also everywhere ninety degrees distant from its\r\npoles P and p. The angle P C N, between the poles P and N of the\r\nequinoctial and ecliptic, is equal to the angle e C Q, called the\r\nobliquity of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 11._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 47, p. 9. _Longitude._ The vernal equinox, ♈, fig. 11, is the zero\r\npoint in the heavens whence celestial longitudes, or the angular motions\r\nof the celestial bodies, are estimated from west to east, the direction\r\nin which they all revolve. The vernal equinox is generally called the\r\nfirst point of Aries, though these two points have not coincided since\r\nthe early ages of astronomy, about 2233 years ago, on account of a\r\nmotion in the equinoctial points, to be explained hereafter. If S ♈,\r\nfig. 10, be the line of the equinoxes, and ♈ the vernal equinox, the\r\ntrue longitude of a planet p is the angle ♈ S p, and its mean longitude\r\nis the angle ♈ C m, the sun being in S. Celestial longitude is the\r\nangular distance of a heavenly body from the vernal equinox; whereas\r\nterrestrial longitude is the angular distance of a place on the surface\r\nof the earth from a meridian arbitrarily chosen, as that of Greenwich.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 48, pp. 9, 58. _Equation of the centre._ The difference between ♈ C\r\nm and ♈ S p, fig. 10; that is, the difference between the true and mean\r\nlongitudes of a planet or satellite. The true and mean places only\r\ncoincide in the points P and A; in every other point of the orbit, the\r\ntrue place is either before or behind the mean place. In moving from A\r\nthrough the arc A Q P, the true place p is behind the mean place m; and\r\nthrough the arc P D A the true place is before the mean place. At its\r\nmaximum, the equation of the centre measures C S, the excentricity of\r\nthe orbit, since it is the difference between the motion of a body in an\r\nellipse and in a circle whose diameter A P is the major axis of the\r\nellipse.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 49, p. 9. _Apsides._ The points P and A, fig. 10, at the\r\nextremities of the major axis of an orbit. P is commonly called the\r\nperihelion, a Greek term signifying _round the sun_; and the point A is\r\ncalled the aphelion, a Greek term signifying _at a distance from the\r\nsun_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 50, p. 9. _Ninety degrees._ A circle is divided into 360 equal\r\nparts, or degrees; each degree into 60 equal parts, called minutes; and\r\neach minute into 60 equal parts, called seconds. It is usual to write\r\nthese quantities thus, 15° 16ʹ 10ʺ, which means fifteen degrees, sixteen\r\nminutes, and ten seconds. It is clear that an arc m n, fig. 4, measures\r\nthe angle m C n; hence we may say, an arc of so many degrees, or an\r\nangle of so many degrees; for, if there be ten degrees in the angle m C\r\nn, there will be ten degrees in the arc m n. It is evident that there\r\nare 90° in a right angle, m C d, or quadrant, since it is the fourth\r\npart of 360°.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 51, p. 9. _Quadratures._ A celestial body is said to be in\r\nquadrature when it is 90 degrees distant from the sun. For example, in\r\nfig. 14, if d be the sun, S the earth, and p the moon, then the moon is\r\nsaid to be in quadrature when she is in either of the points Q or D,\r\nbecause the angles Q S d and D S d, which measure her apparent distance\r\nfrom the sun, are right angles.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 52, p. 9. _Excentricity._ Deviation from circular form. In fig. 6,\r\nC S is the excentricity of the orbit P Q A D. The less C S, the more\r\nnearly does the orbit or ellipse approach the circular form; and, when C\r\nS is zero, the ellipse becomes a circle.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 53, p. 9. _Inclination of an orbit._ Let S, fig. 12, be the centre\r\nof the sun, P N A n the orbit of a planet moving from west to east in\r\nthe direction N p. Let E N m e n be the shadow or projection of the\r\norbit on the plane of the ecliptic, then N S n is the intersection of\r\nthese two planes, for the orbit rises above the plane of the ecliptic\r\ntowards N p, and sinks below it at N P. The angle p N m, which these two\r\nplanes make with one another, is the inclination of the orbit P N p A to\r\nthe plane of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 54, p. 9. _Latitude of a planet._ The angle p S m, fig. 12, or the\r\nheight of the planet p above the ecliptic E N m. In this case the\r\nlatitude is north. Thus, celestial latitude is the angular distance of a\r\ncelestial body from the plane of the ecliptic, whereas terrestrial\r\nlatitude is the angular distance of a place on the surface of the earth\r\nfrom the equator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 12._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 55, p. 9. _Nodes._ The two points N and n, fig. 12, in which the\r\norbit N A n P of a planet or comet intersects the plane of the ecliptic\r\ne N E n. The part N A n of the orbit lies above the plane of the\r\necliptic, and the part n P N below it. The ascending node N is the point\r\nthrough which the body passes in rising above the plane of the ecliptic,\r\nand the descending node n is the point in which the body sinks below it.\r\nThe nodes of a satellite’s orbit are the points in which it intersects\r\nthe plane of the orbit of the planet.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 56, p. 10. _Distance from the sun._ S p in fig. 12. If ♈ be the\r\nvernal equinox, then ♈ S p is the longitude of the planet p, m S p is\r\nits latitude, and S p its distance from the sun. When these three\r\nquantities are known, the place of the planet p is determined in space.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 57, pp. 10, 59. _Elements of an orbit._ Of these there are seven.\r\nLet P N A n, fig. 12, be the elliptical orbit of a planet, C its centre,\r\nS the sun in one of the foci, ♈ the point of Aries, and E N e n the\r\nplane of the ecliptic. The elements are—the major axis A P; the\r\nexcentricity C S; the periodic time, that is, the time of a complete\r\nrevolution of the body in its orbit; and the fourth is the longitude of\r\nthe body at any given instant—for example, that at which it passes\r\nthrough the perihelion P, the point of its orbit nearest to the sun.\r\nThat instant is assumed as the origin of time, whence all preceding and\r\nsucceeding periods are estimated. These four quantities are sufficient\r\nto determine the form of the orbit, and the motion of the body in it.\r\nThree other elements are requisite for determining the position of the\r\norbit in space. These are, the angle ♈ S P, the longitude of the\r\nperihelion; the angle A N e, which is the inclination of the orbit to\r\nthe plane of the ecliptic; and, lastly, the angle ♈ S N, the longitude\r\nof N the ascending node.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 58, p. 10. _Whose planes, &c._ The planes of the orbits, as P N A\r\nn, fig. 12, in which the planets move, are inclined or make small angles\r\ne N A with the plane of the ecliptic E N e n, and cut it in straight\r\nlines, N S n passing through S, the centre of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 59, p. 11. _Momentum._ Force measured by the weight of a body and\r\nits speed, or simple velocity, conjointly. The primitive momentum of the\r\nplanets is, therefore, the quantity of motion which was impressed upon\r\nthem when they were first thrown into space.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 60, p. 11. _Unstable equilibrium._ A body is said to be in\r\nequilibrium when it is so balanced as to remain at rest. But there are\r\ntwo kinds of equilibrium, _stable_ and _unstable_. If a body balanced in\r\nstable equilibrium be slightly disturbed, it will endeavour to return to\r\nrest by a number of movements to and fro, which will continually\r\ndecrease till they cease altogether, and then the body will be restored\r\nto its original state of repose. But, if the equilibrium be unstable,\r\nthese movements to and fro, or oscillations, will become greater and\r\ngreater till the equilibrium is destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 61, p. 14. _Retrograde._ Going backwards, as from east to west,\r\ncontrary to the motion of the planets.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 62, p. 14. _Parallel directions._ Such as never meet, though\r\nprolonged ever so far.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 13._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 14._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 63, pp. 14, 16. _The whole force, &c._ Let S, fig. 13, be the sun,\r\nN m n the plane of the ecliptic, p the disturbed planet moving in its\r\norbit n p N, and d the disturbing planet. Now, d attracts the sun and\r\nthe planet p with different intensities in the directions d S, d p: the\r\ndifference only of these forces disturbs the motion of p; it is\r\ntherefore called the disturbing force. But this whole disturbing force\r\nmay be regarded as equivalent to three forces, acting in the directions\r\np S, p T, and p m. The force acting in the radius vector p S, joining\r\nthe centres of the sun and planet, is called the _radial force_. It\r\nsometimes draws the disturbed planet p from the sun, and sometimes\r\nbrings it nearer to him. The force which acts in the direction of the\r\ntangent p T is called the _tangential force_. It disturbs the motion of\r\np in longitude, that is, it accelerates its motion in some parts of its\r\norbit and retards it in others, so that the radius vector S p does not\r\nmove over equal areas in equal times. (See note 26.) For example, in the\r\nposition of the bodies in fig. 14, it is evident that, in consequence of\r\nthe attraction of d, the planet p will have its motion accelerated from\r\nQ to C, retarded from C to D, again accelerated from D to O, and lastly\r\nretarded from O to Q. The disturbing body is here supposed to be at\r\nrest, and the orbit circular; but, as both bodies are perpetually moving\r\nwith different velocities in ellipses, the perturbations or changes in\r\nthe motions of p are very numerous. Lastly, that part of the disturbing\r\nforce which acts in the direction of a line p m, fig. 13, at right\r\nangles to the plane of the orbit N p n, may be called the perpendicular\r\nforce. It sometimes causes the body to approach nearer, and sometimes to\r\nrecede farther from, the plane of the ecliptic N m n, than it would\r\notherwise do. The action of the disturbing forces is admirably explained\r\nin a work on gravitation, by Mr. Airy, the Astronomer Royal.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 64, pp. 16, 74. _Perihelion._ Fig. 10, P, the point of an orbit\r\nnearest the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 65, p. 16. _Aphelion._ Fig. 10, A, the point of an orbit farthest\r\nfrom the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 66, pp. 16, 17. In fig. 15 the central force is greater than the\r\nexact law of gravity; therefore the curvature P p a is greater than P p\r\nA the real ellipse; hence the planet p comes to the point a, called the\r\naphelion, sooner than if it moved in the orbit P p A, which makes the\r\nline P S A advance to a. In fig. 16, on the contrary, the curvature P p\r\na is less than in the true ellipse, so that the planet p must move\r\nthrough more than the arc P p A, or 180°, before it comes to the\r\naphelion a, which causes the greater axis P S A to recede to a.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 15._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 16._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 67, pp. 16, 17. _Motion of apsides._ Let P S A, fig. 17, be the\r\nposition of the elliptical orbit of a planet, at any time; then, by the\r\naction of the disturbing forces, it successively takes the position Pʹ S\r\nAʹ, Pʺ S Aʺ, &c., till by this direct motion it has accomplished a\r\nrevolution, and then it begins again; so that the motion is perpetual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 17._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 68, p. 17. _Sidereal revolution._ The consecutive return of an\r\nobject to the same star.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 69, p. 17. _Tropical revolution._ The consecutive return of an\r\nobject to the same tropic or equinox.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 70, p. 17. _The orbit only bulges, &c._ In fig. 18 the effect of\r\nthe variation in the excentricity is shown where P p A is the elliptical\r\norbit at any given instant; after a time it will take the form P pʹ A,\r\nin consequence of the decrease in the excentricity C S; then the forms P\r\npʺ A, P pʹʹʹ A, &c., consecutively from the same cause; and, as the\r\nmajor axis P A always retains the same length, the orbit approaches more\r\nand more nearly to the circular form. But, after this has gone on for\r\nsome thousands of years, the orbit contracts again, and becomes more and\r\nmore elliptical.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 18._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 71, pp. 18, 19. _The ecliptic_ is the apparent path of the sun in\r\nthe heavens. See note 46.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 72, p. 18. _This force tends to pull, &c._ The force in question,\r\nacting in the direction p m, fig. 13, pulls the planet p towards the\r\nplane N m n, or pushes it farther above it, giving the planet a tendency\r\nto move in an orbit above or below its undisturbed orbit N p n, which\r\nalters the angle p N m, and makes the node N and the line of nodes N n\r\nchange their positions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 19._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 73, p. 18. _Motion of the nodes._ Let S, fig. 19, be the sun; S N n\r\nthe plane of the ecliptic; P the disturbing body; and p a planet moving\r\nin its orbit p n, of which p n is so small a part that it is represented\r\nas a straight line. The plane S n p of this orbit cuts the plane of the\r\necliptic in the straight line S n. Suppose the disturbing force begins\r\nto act on p, so as to draw the planet into the arc p pʹ; then, instead\r\nof moving in the orbit p n, it will tend to move in the orbit p pʹ nʹ,\r\nwhose plane cuts the ecliptic in the straight line S nʹ. If the\r\ndisturbing force acts again upon the body when at pʹ, so as to draw it\r\ninto the arc pʹ pʺ, the planet will now tend to move in the orbit pʹ pʺ\r\nnʺ, whose plane cuts the ecliptic in the straight line S nʺ. The action\r\nof the disturbing force on the planet when at pʺ will bring the node to\r\nnʹʹʹ, and so on. In this manner the node goes backwards through the\r\nsuccessive points n, nʹ, nʺ, nʹʹʹ, &c., and the line of nodes S n has a\r\nperpetual retrograde motion about S, the centre of the sun. The\r\ndisturbing force has been represented as acting at intervals for the\r\nsake of illustration: in nature it is continuous, so that the motion of\r\nthe node is continuous also; though it is sometimes rapid and sometimes\r\nslow, now retrograde and now direct; but, on the whole, the motion is\r\nslowly retrograde.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 74, p. 18. _When the disturbing planet_ is anywhere in the line S\r\nN, fig. 19, or in its prolongation, it is in the same plane with the\r\ndisturbed planet; and, however much it may affect its motions in that\r\nplane, it can have no tendency to draw it out of it. But when the\r\ndisturbing planet is in P, at right angles to the line S N, and not in\r\nthe plane of the orbit, it has a powerful effect on the motion of the\r\nnodes: between these two positions there is great variety of action.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 75, p. 19. _The changes in the inclination_ are extremely minute\r\nwhen compared with the motion of the node, as evidently appears from\r\nfig. 19, where the angles n p nʹ, nʹ pʹ nʺ, &c., are much smaller than\r\nthe corresponding angles n S nʹ, S nʺ, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 76, p. 20. _Sines and cosines._ Figure 4 is a circle; n p is the\r\nsine, and C p is the cosine of an arc m n. Suppose the radius C m to\r\nbegin to revolve at m, in the direction m n a; then at the point m the\r\nsine is zero, and the cosine is equal to the radius C m. As the line C m\r\nrevolves and takes the successive positions C n, C a, C b, &c., the\r\nsines n p, a q, b r, &c., of the arcs m n, m a, m h, &c., increase,\r\nwhile the corresponding cosines C p, C q, C r, &c., decrease; and when\r\nthe revolving radius takes the position C d, at right angles to the\r\ndiameter g m, the sine becomes equal to the radius C d, and the cosine\r\nis zero. After passing the point d, the contrary happens; for the sines\r\ne K, l V, &c., diminish, and the cosines C K, C V, &c., go on\r\nincreasing, till at g the sine is zero, and the cosine is equal to the\r\nradius C g. The same alternation takes place through the remaining parts\r\ng h, h m, of the circle, so that a sine or cosine never can exceed the\r\nradius. As the rotation of the earth is invariable, each point of its\r\nsurface passes through a complete circle, or 360 degrees, in twenty-four\r\nhours, at a rate of 15 degrees in an hour. Time, therefore, becomes a\r\nmeasure of angular motion, and _vice versâ_, the arcs of a circle a\r\nmeasure of time, since these two quantities vary simultaneously and\r\nequably; and, as the sines and cosines of the arcs are expressed in\r\nterms of the time, they vary with it. Therefore, however long the time\r\nmay be, and how often soever the radius may revolve round the circle,\r\nthe sines and cosines never can exceed the radius; and, as the radius is\r\nassumed to be equal to unity, their values oscillate between unity and\r\nzero.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 77, p. 20. The small excentricities and inclinations of the\r\nplanetary orbits, and the revolutions of all the bodies in the same\r\ndirection, were proved by Euler, La Grange, and La Place, to be\r\nconditions necessary for the stability of the solar system.\r\nSubsequently, however, the periodicity of the terms of the series\r\nexpressing the perturbations was supposed to be sufficient _alone_, but\r\nM. Poisson has shown that to be a mistake; that these three conditions\r\nare requisite for the necessary convergence of the series, and that\r\ntherefore the stability of the system depends on them _conjointly_ with\r\nthe periodicity of the sines and cosines of each term. The author is\r\naware that this note can only be intelligible to the analyst, but she is\r\ndesirous of correcting an error, and the more so as the conditions of\r\nstability afford one of the most striking instances of design in the\r\noriginal construction of our system, and of the foresight and supreme\r\nwisdom of the Divine Architect.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 78, p. 22. _Resisting medium._ A fluid which resists the motions of\r\nbodies, such as atmospheric air, or the highly elastic fluid called\r\nether, with which space is filled.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 79, p. 23. _Obliquity of the ecliptic._ The angle e ♈ q, fig. 11,\r\nbetween the plane of the terrestrial equator q ♈ Q, and the plane of the\r\necliptic E ♈ e.

The two hemispheres balance one another on each side of\r\nthis plane, and would still do so if all the particles of which they\r\nconsist were moveable among themselves, provided the earth were not\r\ndisturbed by the action of the sun and moon, which alters the\r\nparallelism of the equator by the small variation called nutation, to be\r\nexplained hereafter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 20._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 21._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 81, p. 24. _If each particle, &c._ Let P, Pʹ, Pʺ, &c., fig. 21, be\r\nplanets moving in their orbits about the centre of gravity of the\r\nsystem.

Thus two bodies are said to be in conjunction when they are\r\nseen exactly in the same part of the heavens, and in opposition when\r\ndiametrically opposite to one another. Mercury and Venus, which are\r\nnearer to the sun than the earth, are called inferior planets; while all\r\nthe others, being farther from the sun than the earth, are said to be\r\nsuperior planets. Suppose the earth to be at E, fig. 24; then a superior\r\nplanet will be in conjunction with the sun at C, and in opposition to\r\nhim when at O. Again, suppose the earth to be in O, then an inferior\r\nplanet will be in conjunction when at E, and in opposition when at F.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 84, p. 26. _The periodic inequalities_ are computed for a given\r\ntime; and consequently for a given form and position of the orbits of\r\nthe disturbed and disturbing bodies. Although the elements of the orbits\r\nvary so slowly that no sensible effect is produced on inequalities of a\r\nshort period, yet, in the course of time, the secular variations of the\r\nelements change the forms and relative positions of the orbits so much,\r\nthat Jupiter and Saturn, which would have come to the same relative\r\npositions with regard to the sun and to one another after 850 years, do\r\nnot arrive at the same relative positions till after 918 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 85, p. 26. _Configuration._ The relative position of the planets\r\nwith regard to one another, to the sun, and to the plane of the\r\necliptic.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 86, p. 27. In the same manner that the excentricity of an\r\nelliptical orbit may be increased or diminished by the action of the\r\ndisturbing forces, so a circular orbit may acquire less or more\r\nellipticity from the same cause. It is thus that the forms of the orbits\r\nof the first and second satellites of Jupiter oscillate between circles\r\nand ellipses differing very little from circles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 22._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 87, p. 28. _The plane of Jupiter’s equator_ is the imaginary plane\r\npassing through his centre at right angles to his axis of rotation, and\r\ncorresponds to the plane q E Q e, in fig. 1.

In consequence of the satellites moving so nearly in the\r\nplane of Jupiter’s equator, when seen from the earth, they appear to be\r\nalways very nearly in a straight line, however much they may change\r\ntheir positions with regard to one another and to their primary. For\r\nexample, on the evenings of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th of January, 1835,\r\nthe satellites had the configurations given in fig. 23, where O is\r\nJupiter, and 1, 2, 3, 4, are the first, second, third, and fourth\r\nsatellites. The satellite is supposed to be moving in a direction from\r\nthe figure towards the point. On the sixth evening the second satellite\r\nwas seen on the disc of the planet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 23._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 89, p. 28. _Angular motion or velocity_ is the swiftness with which\r\na body revolves—a sling, for example; or the speed with which the\r\nsurface of the earth performs its daily rotation about its axis.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 90, p. 29. _Displacement of Jupiter’s orbit._ The action of the\r\nplanets occasions secular variations in the position of Jupiter’s orbit\r\nJ O, fig. 22, without affecting the plane of his equator J E. Again, the\r\nsun and satellites themselves, by attracting the protuberant matter at\r\nJupiter’s equator, change the position of the plane J E without\r\naffecting J O. Both of these cause perturbations in the motions of the\r\nsatellites.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 91, p. 29. _Precession_, with regard to Jupiter, is a retrograde\r\nmotion of the point where the lines J O, J E, intersect fig. 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 92, p. 30. _Synodic motion of a satellite._ Its motion during the\r\ninterval between two of its consecutive eclipses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 24._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 93, p. 30. _Opposition._ A body is said to be in opposition when\r\nits longitude differs from that of the sun by 180°. If S, fig. 24, be\r\nthe sun, and E the earth, then Jupiter is in opposition when at O, and\r\nin conjunction when at C. In these positions the three bodies are in the\r\nsame straight line.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 94, p. 30. _Eclipses of the satellites._ Let S, fig. 25, be the\r\nsun, J Jupiter, and a B b his shadow. Let the earth be moving in its\r\norbit, in the direction E A R T H, and the third satellite in the\r\ndirection a b m n. When the earth is at E, the satellite, in moving\r\nthrough the arc a b, will vanish at a, and reappear at b, on the same\r\nside of Jupiter. If the earth be in R, Jupiter will be in opposition;\r\nand then the satellite, in moving through the arc a b, will vanish close\r\nto the disc of the planet, and will reappear on the other side of it.\r\nBut, if the satellite be moving through the arc m n, it will appear to\r\npass over the disc, and eclipse the planet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 25._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 95, pp. 30, 43. _Meridian._ A terrestrial meridian is a line\r\npassing round the earth and through both poles. In every part of it noon\r\nhappens at the same instant. In figures 1 and 3, the lines N Q S and N G\r\nS are meridians, C being the centre of the earth, and N S its axis of\r\nrotation. The meridian passing through the Observatory at Greenwich is\r\nassumed by the British as a fixed origin from whence terrestrial\r\nlongitudes are measured. And as each point on the surface of the earth\r\npasses through 360°, or a complete circle, in twenty-four hours, at the\r\nrate of 15° in an hour, time becomes a representative of angular motion.\r\nHence, if the eclipse of a satellite happens at any place at eight\r\no’clock in the evening, and the Nautical Almanac shows that the same\r\nphenomenon will take place at Greenwich at nine, the place of\r\nobservation will be in the 15° of west longitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 96, p. 31. _Conjunction._ Let S be the sun, fig. 24, E the earth,\r\nand J O Jʹ Cʹ the orbit of Jupiter. Then the eclipses which happen when\r\nJupiter is in O are seen 16^m 26^s sooner than those which take place\r\nwhen the planet is in C. Jupiter is in conjunction when at C, and in\r\nopposition when in O.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 26._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 97, p. 31. _In the diagonal, &c._ Were the line A S, fig. 26,\r\n100,000 times longer than A B, Jupiter’s true place would be in the\r\ndirection A Sʹ, the diagonal of the figure A B Sʹ S, which is, of\r\ncourse, out of proportion.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 98, p. 31. _Aberration of light._ The celestial bodies are so\r\ndistant that the rays of light coming from them may be reckoned\r\nparallel. Therefore, let S A, Sʹ B, fig. 26, be two rays of light coming\r\nfrom the sun, or a planet, to the earth moving in its orbit in the\r\ndirection A B. If a telescope be held in the direction A S, the ray S A,\r\ninstead of going down the tube, will impinge on its side, and be lost in\r\nconsequence of the telescope being carried with the earth in the\r\ndirection A B. But, if the tube be held in the position A E, so that A B\r\nis to A S as the velocity of the earth to the velocity of light, the ray\r\nwill pass through Sʹ E A. The star appears to be in the direction A Sʹ,\r\nwhen it really is in the direction A S; hence the angle S A Sʹ is the\r\nangle of aberration.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 99, p. 32. _Density proportional to elasticity._ The more a fluid,\r\nsuch as atmospheric air, is reduced in dimensions by pressure, the more\r\nit resists the pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 100, p. 32. _Oscillations of pendulum retarded._ If a clock be\r\ncarried from the pole to the equator, its rate will be gradually\r\ndiminished, that is, it will go slower and slower: because the\r\ncentrifugal force, which increases from the pole to the equator,\r\ndiminishes the force of gravity.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 101, p. 34. _Disturbing action._ The disturbing force acts here in\r\nthe very same manner as in note 63; only that the disturbing body d,\r\nfig. 14, is the sun, S the earth, and p the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 102, pp. 35, 36, 86. _Perigee._ A Greek word, signifying round the\r\nearth. The perigee of the lunar orbit is the point P, fig. 6, where the\r\nmoon is nearest to the earth. It corresponds to the perihelion of a\r\nplanet. Sometimes the word is used to denote the point where the sun is\r\nnearest to the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 103, p. 35. _Evection._ The evection is produced by the action of\r\nthe radial force in the direction S p, fig. 14, which sometimes\r\nincreases and sometimes diminishes the earth’s attraction to the moon.\r\nIt produces a corresponding temporary change in the excentricity, which\r\nvaries with the position of the major axis of the lunar orbit in respect\r\nof the line S d, joining the centres of the earth and sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 104, p. 35. _Variation._ The lunar perturbation called the\r\nvariation is the alternate acceleration and retardation of the moon in\r\nlongitude, from the action of the tangential force. She is accelerated\r\nin going from quadratures in Q and D, fig. 14, to the points C and O,\r\ncalled syzygies, and is retarded in going from the syzygies C and O to Q\r\nand D again.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 105, p. 36. _Square of time._ If the times increase at the rate of\r\n1, 2, 3, 4, &c., years or hundreds of years, the squares of the times\r\nwill be 1, 4, 9, 16, &c., years or hundreds of years.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 106, p. 37. In all investigations hitherto made with regard to the\r\nacceleration, it was tacitly assumed that the areas described by the\r\nradius vector of the moon were not permanently altered; that is to say,\r\nthat the tangential disturbing force produced no permanent effect. But\r\nMr. Adams has discovered that, in consequence of the constant decrease\r\nin the excentricity of the earth’s orbit, there is a gradual change in\r\nthe central disturbing force which affects the aërial velocity, and\r\nconsequently it alters the amount of the acceleration by a very small\r\nquantity, as well as the variation and other periodical inequalities of\r\nthe moon. On the latter, however, it has no permanent effect, because it\r\naffects them in opposite directions in very moderate intervals of time,\r\nwhereas a very small error in the amount of the acceleration goes on\r\nincreasing as long as the excentricity of the earth’s orbit diminishes,\r\nso that it would ultimately vitiate calculations of the moon’s place for\r\ndistant periods of time. This shows how complicated the moon’s motions\r\nare, and what rigorous accuracy is required in their determination.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the labour requisite _merely_ to _perfect_ or\r\n_correct_ the lunar tables, the moon’s place was determined by\r\nobservation at the Greenwich Observatory in 6000 different points of her\r\norbit, each of which was compared with the same points calculated from\r\nBaron Plana’s formulæ, and to do that _sixteen computers_ were\r\nconstantly employed for _eight years_. Since the longitude is determined\r\nby the motions of the moon, the lunar tables are of the greatest\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 107, p. 37. _Mean anomaly._ The mean anomaly of a planet is its\r\nangular distance from the perihelion, supposing it to move in a circle.\r\nThe true anomaly is its angular distance from the perihelion in its\r\nelliptical orbit. For example, in fig. 10, the mean anomaly is P C m,\r\nand the true anomaly is P S p.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 108, pp. 38, 68. _Many circumferences._ There are 360 degrees or\r\n1,296,000 seconds in a circumference; and, as the acceleration of the\r\nmoon only increases at the rate of eleven seconds in a century, it must\r\nbe a prodigious number of ages before it accumulates to many\r\ncircumferences.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 109, p. 39. _Phases of the moon._ The periodical changes in the\r\nenlightened part of her disc, from a crescent to a circle, depending\r\nupon her position with regard to the sun and earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 110, p. 39. _Lunar eclipse._ Let S, fig. 27, be the sun, E the\r\nearth, and m the moon.

Then a E b is the moon’s shadow, which sometimes\r\neclipses a small portion of the earth’s surface at e, and sometimes\r\nfalls short of it. To a person at e, in the centre of the shadow, the\r\neclipse may be total or annular; to a person not in the centre of the\r\nshadow a part of the sun will be eclipsed; and to one at the edge of the\r\nshadow there will be no eclipse at all.

Whereas the direction of the centrifugal\r\nforce is exactly contrary, being in the direction C Q; hence the\r\ndifference of the two is the force called gravitation, which makes\r\nbodies fall to the surface of the earth. At any point, m, not at the\r\nequator, the direction of gravity is m b, perpendicular to the surface,\r\nbut the centrifugal force acts perpendicularly to N S, the axis of\r\nrotation. Now the effect of the centrifugal force is the same as if it\r\nwere two forces, one of which acting in the direction b m, diminishes\r\nthe force of gravity, and another which, acting in the direction m t,\r\ntangent to the surface at m, urges the particles towards Q, and tends to\r\nswell out the earth at the equator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 30._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 119, p. 45. _Homogeneous mass._ A quantity of matter, everywhere of\r\nthe same density.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 120, p. 45. _Ellipsoid of revolution._ A solid formed by the\r\nrevolution of an ellipse about its axis.

There is also an\r\nincrease in the lengths of the arcs corresponding to the same number of\r\ndegrees from the equator to the poles; for, the angle N C r being equal\r\nto q C d, the elliptical arc N r is less than q d.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 124, p. 46. _Cosine of latitude._ The angles m C a, m C b, fig. 4,\r\nbeing the latitudes of the points a, b, &c., the cosines are C q, C r,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 125, p. 47. _An arc of the meridian._ Let N Q S q, fig. 30, be the\r\nmeridian, and m n the arc to be measured. Then, if Zʹ m, Z n, be\r\nverticals, or lines perpendicular to the surface of the earth, at the\r\nextremities of the arc m n they will meet in p. Q a n, Q b m, are the\r\nlatitudes of the points m and n, and their difference is the angle m p\r\nn. Since the latitudes are equal to the height of the pole of the\r\nequinoctial above the horizon of the places m and n, the angle m p n may\r\nbe found by observation. When the distance m n is measured in feet or\r\nfathoms, and divided by the number of degrees and parts of a degree\r\ncontained in the angle m p n, the length of an arc of one degree is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 126, p. 47. _A series of triangles._ Let M Mʹ, fig. 31, be the\r\nmeridian of any place. A line A B is measured with rods, on level\r\nground, of any number of fathoms, C being some point seen from both ends\r\nof it. As two of the angles of the triangle A B C can be measured, the\r\nlengths of the sides A C, B C, can be computed; and if the angle m A B,\r\nwhich the base A B makes with the meridian, be measured, the length of\r\nthe sides B m, A m, may be obtained by computation, so that A m, a small\r\npart of the meridian, is determined. Again, if D be a point visible from\r\nthe extremities of the known line B C, two of the angles of the triangle\r\nB C D may be measured, and the length of the sides C D, B D, computed.\r\nThen, if the angle B m mʹ be measured, all the angles and the side B m\r\nof the triangle B m mʹ are known, whence the length of the line m mʹ may\r\nbe computed, so that the portion A mʹ of the meridian is determined, and\r\nin the same manner it may be prolonged indefinitely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 31._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 127, pp. 47, 49. _The square of the sine of the latitude._ Q b m,\r\nfig. 30, being the latitude of m, e m is the sine and b e the cosine.\r\nThen the number expressing the length of e m, multiplied by itself, is\r\nthe square of the sine of the latitude; and the number expressing the\r\nlength of b e, multiplied by itself, is the square of the cosine of the\r\nlatitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 128, p. 48.

Let E, fig. 32,\r\nbe the centre of the earth, E H its radius, and m H O the horizon of an\r\nobserver at H. Then H m E is the parallax of a body m, the moon for\r\nexample. As m rises higher and higher in the heavens to the points mʹ,\r\nmʺ, &c., the parallax H mʹ E, H mʺ E, &c., decreases. At Z, the zenith,\r\nor point immediately above the head of the observer, it is zero; and at\r\nm, where the body is in the horizon, the angle H m E is the greatest\r\npossible, and is called the horizontal parallax. It is clear that with\r\nregard to celestial bodies the whole effect of parallax is in the\r\nvertical, or in the direction m mʹ Z; and as a person at H sees mʹ in\r\nthe direction H mʹ A, when it really is in the direction E mʹ B, it\r\nmakes celestial objects appear to be lower than they really are. The\r\ndistance of the moon from the earth has been determined from her\r\nhorizontal parallax. The angle E m H can be measured. E H m is a right\r\nangle, and E H, the radius of the earth, is known in miles; whence the\r\ndistance of the moon E m is easily found. Annual parallax is the angle\r\nunder which the diameter of the earth’s orbit would be seen if viewed\r\nfrom a star.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 131, p. 52. _The radii_ n B, n G, &c., fig. 3, are equal in any one\r\nparallel of latitude, A a B G; therefore a change in the parallax\r\nobserved in that parallel can only arise from a change in the moon’s\r\ndistance from the earth; and when the moon is at her mean distance,\r\nwhich is a constant quantity equal to half the major axis of her orbit,\r\na change in the parallax observed in different latitudes, G and E, must\r\narise from the difference in the lengths of the radii n G and C E.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 132, p. 52. _When Venus is in her nodes._ She must be in the line N\r\nS n where her orbit P N A n cuts the plane of the ecliptic E N e n, fig.\r\n12.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 133, p. 53. _The line described, &c._ Let E, fig. 33, be the earth,\r\nS the centre of the sun, and V the planet Venus. The real transit of the\r\nplanet, seen from E the centre of the earth, would be in the direction A\r\nB.

The periodic times of Jupiter and\r\nVenus are given by observation, and the mean distance of Venus from the\r\ncentre of the sun is known in miles or terrestrial radii; therefore, by\r\nthe rule of three, the square root of the periodic time of Venus is to\r\nthe square root of the periodic time of Jupiter as the cube root of the\r\nmean distance of Venus from the sun to the cube root of the mean\r\ndistance of Jupiter from the sun, which is thus obtained in miles or\r\nterrestrial radii. The root of a number is that number which, once\r\nmultiplied by itself, gives its square; twice multiplied by itself,\r\ngives its cube, &c. For example, twice 2 are 4, and twice 4 are 8; 2 is\r\ntherefore the square root of 4, and the cube root of 8. In the same\r\nmanner 3 times 3 are 9, and 3 times 9 are 27; 3 is therefore the square\r\nroot of 9, and the cube root of 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 135, p. 55. _Inversely, &c._ The quantities of matter in any two\r\nprimary planets are greater in proportion as the cubes of the numbers\r\nrepresenting the mean distances of their satellites are greater, and\r\nalso in proportion as the squares of their periodic times are less.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 136, p. 55. As hardly anything appears more impossible than that\r\nman should have been able to weigh the sun as it were in scales and the\r\nearth in a balance, the method of doing so may have some interest. The\r\nattraction of the sun is to the attraction of the earth as the quantity\r\nof matter in the sun to the quantity of matter in the earth; and, as the\r\nforce of this reciprocal attraction is measured by its effects, the\r\nspace the earth would fall through in a second by the sun’s attraction\r\nis to the space which the sun would fall through by the earth’s\r\nattraction as the mass of the sun to the mass of the earth. Hence, as\r\nmany times as the fall of the earth to the sun in a second exceeds the\r\nfall of the sun to the earth in the same time, so many times does the\r\nmass of the sun exceed the mass of the earth. Thus the weight of the sun\r\nwill be known if the length of these two spaces can be found in miles or\r\nparts of a mile. Nothing can be easier. A heavy body falls through\r\n16·0697 feet in a second at the surface of the earth by the earth’s\r\nattraction; and, as the force of gravity is inversely as the square of\r\nthe distance, it is clear that 16·0697 feet are to the space a body\r\nwould fall through at the distance of the sun by the earth’s attraction,\r\nas the square of the distance of the sun from the earth to the square of\r\nthe distance of the centre of the earth from its surface; that is, as\r\nthe square of 95,000,000 miles to the square of 4000 miles. And thus, by\r\na simple question in the rule of three, the space which the sun would\r\nfall through in a second by the attraction of the earth may be found in\r\nparts of a mile. The space the earth would fall through in a second, by\r\nthe attraction of the sun, must now be found in miles also. Suppose m n,\r\nfig. 4, to be the arc which the earth describes round the sun in C, in a\r\nsecond of time, by the joint action of the sun and the centrifugal\r\nforce. By the centrifugal force alone the earth would move from m to T\r\nin a second, and by the sun’s attraction alone it would fall through T n\r\nin the same time. Hence the length of T n, in miles, is the space the\r\nearth would fall through in a second by the sun’s attraction. Now, as\r\nthe earth’s orbit is very nearly a circle, if 360 degrees be divided by\r\nthe number of seconds in a sidereal year of 365-1/4 days, it will give m\r\nn, the arc which the earth moves through in a second, and then the\r\ntables will give the length of the line C T in numbers corresponding to\r\nthat angle; but, as the radius C n is assumed to be unity in the tables,\r\nif 1 be subtracted from the number representing C T, the length of T n\r\nwill be obtained; and, when multiplied by 95,000,000, to reduce it to\r\nmiles, the space which the earth falls through, by the sun’s attraction,\r\nwill be obtained in miles. By this simple process it is found that, if\r\nthe sun were placed in one scale of a balance, it would require 354,936\r\nearths to form a counterpoise.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 137, p. 59. The sum of the greatest and least distances S P, S A,\r\nfig. 12, is equal to P A, the major axis; and their difference is equal\r\nto twice the excentricity C S. The longitude ♈ S P of the planet, when\r\nin the point P, at its least distance from the sun, is the longitude of\r\nthe perihelion. The greatest height of the planet above the plane of the\r\necliptic E N e n, is equal to the inclination of the orbit P N A n to\r\nthat plane. The longitude of the planet, when in the plane of the\r\necliptic, can only be the longitude of one of the points N or n; and,\r\nwhen one of these points is known, the other is given, being 180°\r\ndistant from it. Lastly, the time included between two consecutive\r\npassages of the planet through the same node N or n, is its periodic\r\ntime, allowance being made for the recess of the node in the interval.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 138, p. 60. Suppose that it were required to find the position of a\r\npoint in space, as of a planet, and that one observation places it in n,\r\nfig. 34, another observation places it in nʹ, another in nʺ, and so on;\r\nall the points n, nʹ, nʺ, nʹʹʹ, &c., being very near to one another. The\r\ntrue place of the planet P will not differ much from any of these\r\npositions. It is evident, from this view of the subject, that P n, P nʹ,\r\nP nʺ, &c., are the errors of observation. The true position of the\r\nplanet P is found by this property, that the squares of the numbers\r\nrepresenting the lines P n, P nʹ, &c., when added together, is the least\r\npossible. Each line P n, P nʹ, &c., being the whole error in the place\r\nof the planet, is made up of the errors of all the elements; and, when\r\ncompared with the errors obtained from theory, it affords the means of\r\nfinding each. The principle of least squares is of very general\r\napplication; its demonstration cannot find a place here; but the reader\r\nis referred to Biot’s Astronomy, vol. ii. p. 203.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 34._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 139, p. 61. The true longitude of Uranus was in advance of the\r\ntables previous to 1795, and continued to advance till 1822, after which\r\nit diminished rapidly till 1830-1, when the observed and calculated\r\nlongitudes agreed, but then the planet fell behind the calculated place\r\nso rapidly that it was clear the tables could no longer represent its\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 140, p. 65. _An axis that, &c._ Fig. 20 represents the earth\r\nrevolving in its orbit about the sun in S, the axis of rotation P p\r\nbeing everywhere parallel to itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 141, p. 65. _Angular velocities that are sensibly uniform._ The\r\nearth and planets revolve about their axis with an equable motion, which\r\nis never either faster or slower.

Fig. 35 represents the position of the apparent orbit\r\nof the sun as it is at present, the earth being in E. The sun is nearer\r\nto the earth in moving through ♎ P ♈ than in moving through ♈ A ♎, but\r\nits motion through ♎ P ♈ is more rapid than its motion through ♈ A ♎;\r\nand, as the swiftness of the motion and the quantity of heat received\r\nvary in the same proportion, a compensation takes place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 35._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 145, p. 76. _In an ellipsoid of revolution_, fig. 1, the polar\r\ndiameter N S, and every diameter in the equator q E Q e, are permanent\r\naxes of rotation, but the rotation would be unstable about any other.\r\nWere the earth to begin to rotate about C a, the angular distance from a\r\nto the equator at q would no longer be ninety degrees, which would be\r\nimmediately detected by the change it would occasion in the latitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 146, pp. 50, 80. Let q ♈ Q, and E ♎ e, fig. 11, be the planes of\r\nthe equator and ecliptic. The angle e ♈ Q, which separates them, called\r\nthe obliquity of the ecliptic, varies in consequence of the action of\r\nthe sun and moon upon the protuberant matter at the earth’s equator.\r\nThat action brings the point Q towards e, and tends to make the plane q\r\n♈ Q coincide with the ecliptic E ♈ e, which causes the equinoctial\r\npoints ♈ and ♎ to move slowly backwards on the plane e ♈ E, at the rate\r\nof 50ʺ·41 annually. This part of the motion, which depends upon the form\r\nof the earth, is called luni-solar precession. Another part, totally\r\nindependent of the form of the earth, arises from the mutual action of\r\nthe earth, planets, and sun, which, altering the position of the plane\r\nof the ecliptic e ♈ E, causes the equinoctial points ♈ and ♎ to advance\r\nat the rate of Oʺ·31 annually; but, as this motion is much less than the\r\nformer, the equinoctial points recede on the plane of the ecliptic at\r\nthe rate of 50ʺ·1 annually. This motion is called the precession of the\r\nequinoxes.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 147, p. 81. Let q ♈ Q, e ♈ E, fig. 36, be the planes of the\r\nequinoctial or celestial equator and ecliptic, and p, P, their poles.\r\nThen suppose p, the pole of the equator, to revolve with a tremulous or\r\nwavy motion in the little ellipse p c d b in about 19 years, both\r\nmotions being very small, while the point a is carried round in the\r\ncircle a A B in 25,868 years. The tremulous motion may represent the\r\nhalf-yearly variation, the motion in the ellipse gives an idea of the\r\nnutation discovered by Bradley, and the motion in the circle a A B\r\narises from the precession of the equinoxes. The greater axis p d of the\r\nsmall ellipse is 18ʺ·5, its minor axis b c is 13ʺ·74. These motions are\r\nso small that they have very little effect on the parallelism of the\r\naxis of the earth’s rotation during its revolution round the sun, as\r\nrepresented in fig. 20. As the stars are fixed, this real motion in the\r\npole of the earth must cause an apparent change in their places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 36._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: figure: equidistant wires in an eye-piece]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 148, p. 83. By means of a transit instrument, which is a telescope\r\nmounted so as to revolve only in the plane of the meridian, the instant\r\nof the transit or passage of a celestial body across the meridian can be\r\ndetermined. The transits of the principal stars are used to ascertain\r\nthe time, or, which is the same thing, the amount of the error of\r\nclocks. A system of equidistant wires, as represented in the figure, is\r\nplaced in the focus of the eye-piece, so that the middle wire is\r\nperpendicular and at right angles to the axis of the telescope. It\r\nconsequently represents a portion of the celestial meridian; and when a\r\nstar is seen to cross that wire it then crosses the celestial meridian\r\nof the place of observation. A clock beating seconds being close at\r\nhand, the duty of an observer is to note the exact second and part of a\r\nsecond at which a star crosses each wire successively in consequence of\r\nthe rotation of the earth. Then the mean of all these observations will\r\ngive the time at which the star crosses the celestial meridian of the\r\nplace of observation to the tenth of a second, provided the observations\r\nare accurate. Now it happens that the simultaneous impression on the eye\r\nand ear is estimated differently by different observers, so that one\r\nperson will note the transit of a star, for example, as happening the\r\nfraction of a second sooner or later than another person; and as that is\r\nthe case in every observation he makes, it is called his _personal\r\nequation_, that is to say, it is a correction that must be applied to\r\nall the observations of the individual, and a curious instance of\r\nindividuality it is. For instance, M. Otto Struve notes every\r\nobservation Oʺ·11 too soon, M. Peters Oʺ·13 too late; M. Struve noted\r\nevery observation one second later than M. Bessel, and M. Argelander\r\nestimated the transit of a star 1ʺ·2 later than M. Bessel. All these\r\ngentlemen were or are first-rate observers; and when the personal\r\nequation is known it is easy to correct the observations. However, to\r\navoid that inconvenience Mr. Bond has introduced a method in the\r\nObservatory at Cambridge in the United States in which touch is combined\r\nwith sight instead of hearing, which is now used also at Greenwich. The\r\nobserver at the moment of the observation presses his fingers on a\r\nmachine which by means of a galvanic battery conveys the impression to\r\nwhere time is measured and marked, so that the observation is at once\r\nrecorded and the personal equation avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 149, p. 84. _Let_ N be the pole, fig. 11, e E the ecliptic, and Q q\r\nthe equator.

So that the time of the\r\nsun’s passage through the arc ♈ A ♎ is greater than the time he takes to\r\ngo through the arc ♎ P ♈. The major axis A P coincided with ♎ ♈, the\r\nline of the equinoxes, 4000 years before the Christian era; at that time\r\nP was in the point ♈. In 6468 of the Christian era the perigee P will\r\ncoincide with ♎.

When the moon is new,\r\nshe is at C, and when full she is at O; and, as both sun and moon are\r\nthen on the same meridian, it occasions the spring-tides, it being high\r\nwater at places under C and O, while it is low water at those under Q\r\nand D.

When a ray\r\nof light, passing through the air, falls on this surface in any\r\ndirection I C, part of it is reflected in the direction C S, and the\r\nother part is bent at C, and passes through the glass or water in the\r\ndirection C R. I C is called the incident ray, and I C P the angle of\r\nincidence; C S is the reflected ray, and P C S the angle of reflection;\r\nC R is the refracted ray, and p C R the angle of refraction. The plane\r\npassing through S C and I C is the plane of reflection, and the plane\r\npassing through I C and C R is the plane of refraction. In ordinary\r\ncases, C I, C S, C R, are all in the same plane. We see the surface by\r\nmeans of the reflected light, which would otherwise be invisible.\r\nWhatever the reflecting surface may be, and however obliquely the light\r\nmay fall upon it, the angle of reflection is always equal to the angle\r\nof incidence. Thus I C, Iʹ C, being rays incident on the surface at C,\r\nthey will be reflected into C S, C Sʹ, so that the angle S C P will be\r\nequal to the angle I C P, and Sʹ C P equal to Iʹ C P. That is by no\r\nmeans the case with the refracted rays. The incident rays I C, Iʹ C, are\r\nbent at C towards the perpendicular, in the direction C R, C Rʹ; and the\r\nlaw of refraction is such, that the sine of the angle of incidence has a\r\nconstant ratio to the sine of the angle of refraction; that is to say,\r\nthe number expressing the length of I m, the sine of I C P, divided by\r\nthe number expressing the length of R n, the sine of R C p, is the same\r\nfor all the rays of light that can fall upon the surface of any one\r\nsubstance, and is called its index of refraction. Though the index of\r\nrefraction be the same for any one substance, it is not the same for all\r\nsubstances. For water it is 1·336; for crown-glass it is 1·535; for\r\nflint-glass, 1·6; for diamond, 2·487; and for chromate of lead it is 3,\r\nwhich substance has a higher refractive power than any other known.\r\nLight falling perpendicularly on a surface passes through it without\r\nbeing refracted. If the light be now supposed to pass from a dense into\r\na rare medium, as from glass or water into air, then R C, Rʹ C, become\r\nthe incident rays; and in this case the refracted rays, C I, C Iʹ, are\r\nbent from the perpendicular instead of towards it. When the incidence is\r\nvery oblique, as r C, the light never passes into the air at all, but it\r\nis _totally_ reflected in the direction C rʹ, so that the angle p C r is\r\nequal to p C rʹ; that frequently happens at the second surface of glass.\r\nWhen a ray I C falls from air upon a piece of glass A B, it is in\r\ngeneral refracted at each surface. At C it is bent towards the\r\nperpendicular, and at R from it, and the ray emerges parallel to I C;\r\nbut, when the ray is very oblique to the second surface, it is totally\r\nreflected. An object seen by total reflection is nearly as vivid as when\r\nseen by direct vision, because no part of the light is refracted. When\r\nlight falls upon a plate of crown-glass, at an angle of 4° 32ʹ counted\r\nfrom the surface, the glass reflects 4 times more light than it\r\ntransmits. At an angle of 7° 1ʹ the reflected light is double of the\r\ntransmitted; at an angle of 11° 8ʹ the light reflected is equal to that\r\ntransmitted; at 17° 17ʹ the reflected is equal to 1/2 the transmitted\r\nlight; at 26° 38ʹ it is equal to 1/4, the variation, according to Arago,\r\nbeing as the square of the cosine.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 189, p. 154. _Atmospheric refraction._ Let a b, a b, &c., fig. 49,\r\nbe strata, or extremely thin layers, of the atmosphere, which increase\r\nin density towards m n, the surface of the earth. A ray coming from a\r\nstar meeting the surface of the atmosphere at S would be refracted at\r\nthe surface of each layer, and would consequently move in the curved\r\nline S v v v A; and as an object is seen in the direction of the ray\r\nthat meets the eye, the star, which really is in the direction A S,\r\nwould seem to a person at A to be in s. So that refraction, which always\r\nacts in a vertical direction, raises objects above their true place. For\r\nthat reason, a body at Sʹ, below the horizon H A O, would be raised, and\r\nwould be seen in sʹ. The sun is frequently visible by refraction after\r\nhe is set, or before he is risen. There is no refraction in the zenith\r\nat Z. It increases all the way to the horizon, where it is greatest, the\r\nvariation being proportional to the tangent of the angles Z A S, Z A Sʹ,\r\nthe distances of the bodies S Sʹ from the zenith. The more obliquely the\r\nrays fall, the greater the refraction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 49._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 50._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 190, p. 154. _Bradley’s method of ascertaining the amount of\r\nrefraction._ Let Z, fig. 50, be the zenith or point immediately above an\r\nobserver at A; let H O be his horizon, and P the pole of the equinoctial\r\nA Q. Hence P A Q is a right angle. A star as near to the pole as s would\r\nappear to revolve about it, in consequence of the rotation of the earth.\r\nAt noon, for example, it would be at s above the pole, and at midnight\r\nit would be in sʹ below it. The sum of the true zenith distances, Z A s,\r\nZ A sʹ, is equal to twice the angle Z A P. Again, S and Sʹ being the sun\r\nat his greatest distances from the equinoctial A Q when in the\r\nsolstices, the sum of his true zenith distances, Z A S, Z A Sʹ, is equal\r\nto twice the angle Z A Q. Consequently, the four true zenith distances,\r\nwhen added together, are equal to twice the right angle Q A P; that is,\r\nthey are equal to 180°. But the observed or apparent zenith distances\r\nare less than the true on account of refraction; therefore the sum of\r\nthe four apparent zenith distances is less than 180° by the whole amount\r\nof the four refractions.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 191, p. 155. _Terrestrial refraction._ Let C, fig. 51, be the\r\ncentre of the earth, A an observer at its surface, A H his horizon, and\r\nB some distant point, as the top of a hill. Let the arc B A be the path\r\nof a ray coming from B to A; E B, E A, tangents to its extremities; and\r\nA G, B F, perpendicular to C B. However high the hill B may be, it is\r\nnothing when compared with C A, the radius of the earth; consequently, A\r\nB differs so little from A D that the angles A E B and A C B are\r\nsupplementary to one another; that is, the two taken together are equal\r\nto 180°. A C B is called the horizontal angle. Now B A H is the real\r\nheight of B, and E A H its apparent height; hence refraction raises the\r\nobject B, by the angle E A B, above its real place. Again, the real\r\ndepression of A, when viewed from B, is F B A, whereas its apparent\r\ndepression is F B E, so E B A is due to refraction. The angle F B A is\r\nequal to the sum of the angles B A H and A C B; that is, the true\r\nelevation is equal to the true depression and the horizontal angle. But\r\nthe true elevation is equal to the apparent elevation diminished by the\r\nrefraction; and the true depression is equal to the apparent depression\r\nincreased by refraction. Hence twice the refraction is equal to the\r\nhorizontal angle augmented by the difference between the apparent\r\nelevation and the apparent depression.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 51._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 192, p. 155. Fig. 52 represents the phenomenon in question. S P is\r\nthe real ship, with its inverted and direct images seen in the air. Were\r\nthere no refraction, the rays would come from the ship S P to the eye E\r\nin the direction of the straight lines; but, on account of the variable\r\ndensity of the inferior strata of the atmosphere, the rays are bent in\r\nthe curved lines P c E, P d E, S m E, S n E. Since an object is seen in\r\nthe direction of the tangent to that point of the ray which meets the\r\neye, the point P of the real ship is seen at p and pʹ, and the point S\r\nseems to be in s and sʹ; and, as all the other points are transferred in\r\nthe same manner, direct and inverted images of the ship are formed in\r\nthe air above it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 52._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 193, p. 156. Fig. 53 represents the section of a poker, with the\r\nrefraction produced by the hot air surrounding it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 53._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 194, p. 156. _The solar spectrum._ A ray from the sun at S, fig.\r\n54, admitted into a dark room, through a small round hole H in a\r\nwindow-shutter, proceeds in a straight line to a screen D, on which it\r\nforms a bright circular spot of white light, of nearly the same diameter\r\nwith the hole H. But when the refracting angle B A C of a glass prism is\r\ninterposed, so that the sunbeam falls on A C the first surface of the\r\nprism, and emerges from the second surface A B at equal angles, it\r\ncauses the rays to deviate from the straight path S D, and bends them to\r\nthe screen M N, where they form a coloured image V R of the sun, of the\r\nsame breadth with the diameter of the hole H, but much longer. The space\r\nV R consists of seven colours—violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow,\r\norange, and red. The violet and red, being the most and least\r\nrefrangible rays, are at the extremities, and the green occupy the\r\nmiddle part at G. The angle D g G is called the mean _deviation_, and\r\nthe spreading of the coloured rays over the angle V g R the\r\n_dispersion_. The deviation and dispersion vary with the refracting\r\nangle B A C of the prism, and with the substance of which it is made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 54._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 195, pp. 159, 164. Under the same circumstances, and where the\r\nrefracting angles of the two prisms are equal, the angles D g G and V g\r\nR, fig. 54, are greater for flint-glass than for crown-glass. But, as\r\nthey vary with the angle of the prism, it is only necessary to augment\r\nthe refracting angle of the crown-glass prism by a certain quantity, to\r\nproduce nearly the same deviation and dispersion with the flint-glass\r\nprism. Hence, when the two prisms are placed with their refracting\r\nangles in opposite directions, as in fig. 54, they nearly neutralize\r\neach other’s effects, and refract a beam of light without resolving it\r\ninto its elementary coloured rays. Sir David Brewster has come to the\r\nconclusion that there may be refraction without colour by means of two\r\nprisms, or two lenses, when properly adjusted, even though they be made\r\nof the same kind of glass.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 196, p. 165. The object glass of the achromatic telescope consists\r\nof a convex lens A B, fig. 55, of crown-glass placed on the outside,\r\ntowards the object, and of a concave-convex lens C D of flint-glass,\r\nplaced towards the eye. The focal length of a lens is the distance of\r\nits centre from the point in which the rays converge, as F, fig. 60. If,\r\nthen, the lenses A B and C D be so constructed that their focal lengths\r\nare in the same proportion as their dispersive powers, they will refract\r\nrays of light without colour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 55._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 197, p. 165. If the mean refracting angle of the prism D g G, fig.\r\n54, were the same for all substances, then the difference D g V - D g R\r\nwould be the dispersion. But the angle of the prism being the same, all\r\nthese angles are different in each substance, so that in order to obtain\r\nthe dispersion of any substance the angle D g V - D g R must be divided\r\nby the angle D g G or its excess above unity, to which the mean\r\nrefraction is always proportional. According to Mr. Fraunhofer the\r\nrefraction of the extreme violet and red rays in crown-glass is 1·5466\r\nand 1·5258; so D g V - D g R = 1·5466 - 1·5258 = ·0208, and half the sum\r\nof the excess of each above unity is = ·5362; consequently\r\n\r\n       (D g V - D g R)/D g G = ·0208/·5362 = 0·03879; for diamond\r\n\r\n       (D g V - D g R)/D g G = (2·467 - 2·411)/1·439 = 0·0389;\r\n\r\nso that the dispersive power of diamond is a little less than that of\r\ncrown-glass; hence the splendid refracted colours which distinguish\r\ndiamond from every other precious stone are not owing to its high\r\ndispersive power, but to its great mean refraction.—SIR DAVID BREWSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 198, p. 168. When a sunbeam, after having passed through a coloured\r\nglass V Vʹ, fig. 56, enters a dark room by two small slits O Oʹ in a\r\ncard, or piece of tin, they produce alternate bright and black bands on\r\na screen S Sʹ at a little distance. When either one or other of the\r\nslits O or Oʹ is stopped, the dark bands vanish, and the screen is\r\nilluminated by a uniform light, proving that the dark bands are produced\r\nby the interference of the two sets of rays. Again, let H m, fig. 57, be\r\na beam of white light passing through a hole at H, made with a fine\r\nneedle in a piece of lead or a card, and received on a screen S Sʹ. When\r\na hair, or a small slip of card h hʹ, about the 30th of an inch in\r\nbreadth, is held in the beam, the rays bend round on each side of it,\r\nand, arriving at the screen in different states of vibration, interfere\r\nand form a series of coloured fringes on each side of a central white\r\nband m. When a piece of card is interposed at C, so as to intercept the\r\nlight which passes on one side of the hair, the coloured fringes vanish.\r\nWhen homogeneous light is used, the fringes are broadest in red, and\r\nbecome narrower for each colour of the spectrum progressively to the\r\nviolet, which gives the narrowest and most crowded fringes. These very\r\nelegant experiments are due to Dr. Thomas Young.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 56._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 57._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 58._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 199, pp. 171, 200. Fig. 58 shows Newton’s rings, of which there are\r\nseven, formed by screwing two lenses of glass together. Provided the\r\nincident light be white, they always succeed each other in the following\r\norder:—\r\n\r\n1st ring, or 1st order of colours: Black, very faint blue, brilliant\r\nwhite, yellow, orange, red.\r\n\r\n2nd ring: Dark purple, or rather violet, blue, a very imperfect yellow\r\ngreen, vivid yellow, crimson red.\r\n\r\n3rd ring: Purple, blue, rich grass green, fine yellow, pink, crimson.\r\n\r\n4th ring: Dull blueish green, pale yellowish pink, red.\r\n\r\n5th ring: Pale blueish green, white, pink.\r\n\r\n6th ring: Pale blue green, pale pink.\r\n\r\n7th ring: Very pale blueish green, very pale pink.\r\n\r\nAfter the seventh order the colours become too faint to be\r\ndistinguished. The rings decrease in breadth, and the colours become\r\nmore crowded together, as they recede from the centre. When the light is\r\nhomogeneous, the rings are broadest in the red, and decrease in breadth\r\nwith every successive colour of the spectrum to the violet.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 200, p. 172. The absolute thickness of the film of air between the\r\nglasses is found as follows:—Let A F B C, fig. 59, be the section of a\r\nlens lying on a plane surface or plate of glass P Pʹ, seen edgewise, and\r\nlet E C be the diameter of the sphere of which the lens is a segment. If\r\nA B be the diameter of any one of Newton’s rings, and B D parallel to C\r\nE, then B D or C F is the thickness of the air producing it. E C is a\r\nknown quantity; and when A B, the diameter, is measured with compasses,\r\nB D or F C can be computed. Newton found that the length of B D,\r\ncorresponding to the darkest part of the first ring, is the 98,000th\r\npart of an inch when the rays fall perpendicularly on the lens, and from\r\nthis he deduced the thickness corresponding to each colour in the system\r\nof rings. By passing each colour of the solar spectrum in succession\r\nover the lenses, Newton also determined the thickness of the film of air\r\ncorresponding to each colour, from the breadth of the rings, which are\r\nalways of the same colour with the homogeneous light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 59._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 201, p. 174. The focal length or distance of a lens is the distance\r\nfrom its centre to the point F, fig. 60, in which the refracted rays\r\nmeet. Let L Lʹ be a lens of very short focal distance fixed in the\r\nwindow-shutter of a dark room. A sunbeam S L Lʹ passing through the lens\r\nwill be brought to a focus in F, whence it will diverge in lines F C, F\r\nD, and will form a circular image of light on the opposite wall. Suppose\r\na sheet of lead, having a small pin-hole pierced through it, to be\r\nplaced in this beam; when the pin-hole is viewed from behind with a lens\r\nat E, it is surrounded with a series of coloured rings, which vary in\r\nappearance with the relative positions of the pin-hole and eye with\r\nregard to the point F. When the hole is the 30th of an inch in diameter\r\nand at the distance of 6-1/2 feet from F, when viewed at the distance of\r\n24 inches, there are seven rings of the following colours:—\r\n\r\n1st order: White, pale yellow, yellow, orange, dull red.\r\n\r\n2nd order: Violet, blue, whitish, greenish yellow, fine yellow, orange\r\nred.\r\n\r\n3rd order: Purple, indigo blue, greenish blue, brilliant green, yellow\r\ngreen, red.\r\n\r\n4th order: Blueish green, blueish white, red.\r\n\r\n5th order: Dull green, faint blueish white, faint red.\r\n\r\n6th order: Very faint green, very faint red.\r\n\r\n7th order: A trace of green and red.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 60._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 61._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 62._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 202, p. 175. Let L Lʹ, fig. 61, be the section of a lens placed in\r\na window-shutter, through which a very small beam of light S L Lʹ passes\r\ninto a dark room, and comes to a focus in F. If the edge of a knife K N\r\nbe held in the beam, the rays bend away from it in hyperbolic curves K\r\nr, K rʹ, &c., instead of coming directly to the screen in the straight\r\nline K E, which is the boundary of the shadow. As these bending rays\r\narrive at the screen in different states of undulation, they interfere,\r\nand form a series of coloured fringes, r rʹ, &c., along the edge of the\r\nshadow K E S N of the knife. The fringes vary in breadth with the\r\nrelative distances of the knife-edge and screen from F.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 203, p. 177. Fig. 43 represents the phenomena in question, where S\r\nS is the surface, and I the centre of incident waves. The reflected\r\nwaves are the dark lines returning towards I, which are the same as if\r\nthey had originated in C on the other side of the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 204, p. 180. Fig. 62 represents a prismatic crystal of tourmaline,\r\nwhose axis is A X. The slices that are used for polarising light are cut\r\nparallel to A X.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 205, p. 181. _Double refraction._ If a pencil of light R r, fig.\r\n63, falls upon a rhombohedron of Iceland spar A B X C, it is separated\r\ninto two equal pencils of light at r, which are refracted in the\r\ndirections r O, r E: when these arrive at O and E they are again\r\nrefracted, and pass into the air in the directions O o, E o, parallel to\r\none another and to the incident ray R r. The ray r O is refracted\r\naccording to the ordinary law, which is, that the sines of the angles of\r\nincidence and refraction bear a constant ratio to one another (see Note\r\n184), and the rays R r, r O, O o, are all in the same plane. The pencil\r\nr E, on the contrary, is bent aside out of that plane, and its\r\nrefraction does not follow the constant ratio of the sines; r E is\r\ntherefore called the extraordinary ray, and r O the ordinary ray. In\r\nconsequence of this bisection of the light, a spot of ink at O is seen\r\ndouble at O and E, when viewed from r I; and when the crystal is turned\r\nround, the image E revolves about O, which remains stationary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 63._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 206, p. 182. Both of the parallel rays O o and E o, fig. 63, are\r\npolarised on leaving the doubly refracting crystal, and in both the\r\nparticles of light make their vibrations at right angles to the lines O\r\no, E o. In the one, however, these vibrations lie, for example, in the\r\nplane of the horizon, while the vibrations of the other lie in the\r\nvertical plane perpendicular to the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 207, p. 183. If light be made to fall in various directions on the\r\nnatural faces of a crystal of Iceland spar, or on faces cut and polished\r\nartificially, one direction A X, fig. 63, will be found, along which the\r\nlight passes without being separated into two pencils. A X is the optic\r\naxis. In some substances there are two optic axes forming an angle with\r\neach other. The optic axis is not a fixed line, it only has a fixed\r\ndirection; for if a crystal of Iceland spar be divided into smaller\r\ncrystals, each will have its optic axis; but if all these pieces be put\r\ntogether again, their optic axes will be parallel to A X. Every line,\r\ntherefore, within the crystal parallel to A X is an optic axis; but as\r\nthese lines have all the same direction, the crystal is still said to\r\nhave but one optic axis.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 208, p. 184. If I C, fig. 48, be the incident and C S the reflected\r\nrays, then the particles of polarised light make their vibrations at\r\nright angles to the plane of the paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 209, p. 184. Let A A, fig. 48, be the surface of the reflector, I C\r\nthe incident and C S the reflected rays; then, when the angle S C B is\r\n57°, and consequently the angle P C S equal to 33°, the black spot will\r\nbe seen at C by an eye at S.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 210, p. 185. Let A B, fig. 48, be a reflecting surface, I C the\r\nincident and C S the reflected rays; then, if the surface be\r\nplate-glass, the angle S C B must be 57°, in order that C S may be\r\npolarised. If the surface be crown-glass or water, the angle S C B must\r\nbe 56° 55ʹ for the first, and 53° 11ʹ for the second, in order to give a\r\npolarised ray.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 211, p. 186. A polarising apparatus is represented in fig. 64,\r\nwhere R r is a ray of light falling on a piece of glass r at an angle of\r\n57°: the reflected ray r s is then polarised, and may be viewed through\r\na piece of tourmaline in s, or it may be received on another plate of\r\nglass, B, whose surface is at right angles to the surface of r. The ray\r\nr s is again reflected in s, and comes to the eye in the direction s E.\r\nThe plate of mica, M I, or of any substance that is to be examined, is\r\nplaced between the points r and s.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 64._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 212, p. 187. In order to see these figures, the polarised ray r s,\r\nfig. 64, must pass through the optic axis of the crystal, which must be\r\nheld as near as possible to s on one side, and the eye placed as near as\r\npossible to s on the other. Fig. 65 shows the image formed by a crystal\r\nof Iceland spar which has one optic axis. The colours in the rings are\r\nexactly the same with those of Newton’s rings given in Note 199, and the\r\ncross is black. If the spar be turned round its axis, the rings suffer\r\nno change; but if the tourmaline through which it is viewed, or the\r\nplate of glass, B, be turned round, this figure will be seen at the\r\nangles 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° of its revolution. But in the\r\nintermediate points, that is, at the angles 45°, 135°, 225°, and 315°,\r\nanother system will appear, such as represented in fig. 66, where all\r\nthe colours of the rings are complementary to those of fig. 65, and the\r\ncross is white. The two systems of rings, if superposed, would produce\r\nwhite light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 65._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 66._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 213, p. 188. Saltpetre, or nitre, crystallises in six-sided prisms\r\nhaving two optic axes inclined to one another at an angle of 5°. A slice\r\nof this substance about the 6th or 8th of an inch thick, cut\r\nperpendicularly to the axis of the prism, and placed very near to s,\r\nfig. 64, so that the polarised ray r s may pass through it, exhibits the\r\nsystem of rings represented in fig. 67, where the points C and C mark\r\nthe position of the optic axes. When the plate B, fig. 64, is turned\r\nround, the image changes successively to those given in figs. 68, 69,\r\nand 70. The colours of the rings are the same with those of thin plates,\r\nbut they vary with the thickness of the nitre. Their breadth enlarges or\r\ndiminishes also with the colour, when homogeneous light is used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 67._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 68._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 69._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 70._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 71._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 214, p. 189. Fig. 71 represents the appearance produced by placing\r\na slice of rock crystal in the polarised ray r s, fig. 64. The uniform\r\ncolour in the interior of the image depends upon the thickness of the\r\nslice; but whatever that colour may be, it will alternately attain a\r\nmaximum brightness and vanish with the revolution of the glass B. It may\r\nbe observed, that the two kinds of quartz, or rock crystal, mentioned in\r\nthe text, are combined in the amethyst, which consists of alternate\r\nlayers of right-handed and left-handed quartz, whose planes are parallel\r\nto the axis of the crystal.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 215, p. 193. Suppose the major axis A P of an ellipse, fig. 18, to\r\nbe invariable, but the excentricity C S continually to diminish, the\r\nellipse would bulge more and more; and when C S vanished, it would\r\nbecome a circle whose diameter is A P. Again, if the excentricity were\r\ncontinually to increase, the ellipse would be more and more flattened\r\ntill C S was equal to C P, when it would become a straight line A P. The\r\ncircle and straight line are therefore the limits of the ellipse.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 216, p. 194.

According to Mr. Joule, that heat is produced by\r\nmotion, and that it is equivalent to it, Mr. Thompson of Glasgow\r\ninvestigates from whence the sun derives his heat, since he shows that\r\nneither combustion nor his primitive heat could have supplied the waste\r\nduring 6000 years. He concludes that the solar heat is maintained by\r\nmyriads of minute bodies that are revolving at the edge of his dense\r\nnebulosity or atmosphere, some of which are often seen by us as falling\r\nstars. These, vaporized by his heat, and drawn by his attraction, meet\r\nwith intense resistance on entering the solar atmosphere as a shower of\r\nmeteoric rain; through it they descend in spiral lines to the sun’s\r\nsurface, producing enormous heat by friction during their fall, and\r\nserving for fuel on their arrival.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 218, p. 252.

The foot-pound, or unit of mechanical force\r\nestablished by Mr. Joule, is the force that would raise one pound weight\r\nof matter to the height of one foot; or it is the impetus or force\r\ngenerated by a body of one pound weight falling by its gravitation\r\nthrough the height of one foot.\r\n\r\nImpetus, vis viva, or living force, is equal to the mass of a body\r\nmultiplied by the square of the velocity with which it is moving, and is\r\nthe true measure of work or labour. For if a weight be raised 10 feet,\r\nit will require four times the labour to raise an equal weight 40 feet.\r\nIf both these weights be allowed to descend freely by their gravitation,\r\nat the end of their fall their velocities will be as 1 to 2; that is, as\r\nthe square roots of their heights; but the _effect produced_ will be as\r\ntheir masses multiplied by 1 and 4; but these are the squares of their\r\nvelocities: hence the impetus or vis viva is as the mass into the square\r\nof the velocity.\r\n\r\nThus impetus is the true measure of the labour employed to raise the\r\nweights, and of the _effect_ of their descent, and is entirely\r\nindependent of time. Now heat is proportional to impetus, and impetus is\r\nthe true measure of labour. In percussion the heat evolved is in\r\nproportion to the force of the impetus, and is thus measured by labour.\r\n\r\nTravail is a word used in mechanics, to express that _work done_ is\r\nequal to the labouring force employed. The work done may be resistance\r\novercome or any other effect produced, while the labouring force may be\r\na horse, a steam-engine, wind, falling water, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 223, p. 313. When a stream of positive electricity descends from P\r\nto n, fig. 72, in a vertical wire at right angles to the plane of the\r\nhorizontal circle A B, the negative electricity ascends from n to P, and\r\nthe force exerted by the current makes the north pole of a magnet\r\nrevolve about the wire in the direction of the arrow-heads in the\r\ncircumference, and it makes the south pole revolve in the opposite\r\ndirection. When the current of positive electricity flows upwards from n\r\nto P, these effects are reversed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 72._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 73._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 224, p. 314. Fig. 73 represents a helix or coil of copper wire,\r\nterminated by two cups containing a little quicksilver. When the\r\npositive wire of a Voltaic battery is immersed in the cup p, and the\r\nnegative wire in the cup n, the circuit is completed. The quicksilver\r\nensures the connection between the battery and the helix, by conveying\r\nthe electricity from the one to the other. While the electricity flows\r\nthrough the helix, the magnet S N remains suspended within it, but falls\r\ndown the moment it ceases. The magnet always turns its south pole S\r\ntowards P, the positive wire of the battery, and its north pole towards\r\nthe negative wire.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 225, p. 316. A copper wire coiled in the form represented in fig.\r\n73 was the first and most simple form of the electro-dynamic cylinder.\r\nWhen its extremities P and n are connected with the positive and\r\nnegative poles of a Voltaic battery, it becomes a perfect magnet during\r\nthe time that a current of electricity is flowing through it, P and n\r\nbeing its north and south poles.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 226, p. 344. It is to Halley we are indebted for the first\r\ndeclination chart and the theory of 4 poles of maximum magnetic\r\nintensity, since confirmed by observation, as well as the earliest\r\nauthentic values of the magnetic elements in London and St. Helena,\r\nwhere he went on purpose to make observations on terrestrial magnetism.\r\nSince that time M. Gauss has formed charts of the magnetic lines, and\r\npublished a theory which very nearly represents the magnetic state of\r\nthe globe. The mass of observations daily making by our cruizers and our\r\nGovernment surveys in every part of the earth is enormous.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 227, p. 360. In fig. 74 the hyperbola H P Y, the parabola p P R,\r\nand the ellipse A E P L, have the focal distance S P, and coincide\r\nthrough a small space on each side of the perihelion P; and, as a comet\r\nis only visible when near P, it is difficult to ascertain which of the\r\nthree curves it moves in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 74._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 228, p. 363. In fig. 75, E A represents the orbit of Halley’s\r\ncomet, E T the orbit of the earth, and S the sun.

It is\r\nevident that, for the same focal distance S P, there can be but one\r\ncircle and one parabola p P R, but that there may be an infinity of\r\nellipses between the circle and the parabola, and an infinity of\r\nhyperbolas H P Y exterior to the parabola p P R.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 230, p. 387. Let A B, fig. 26, be the diameter of the earth’s\r\norbit, and suppose a star to be seen in the direction A Sʹ from the\r\nearth when at A. Six months afterwards, the earth, having moved through\r\nhalf of its orbit, would arrive at B, and then the star would appear in\r\nthe direction B Sʹ, if the diameter A B, as seen from Sʹ, had any\r\nsensible magnitude. But A B, which is 190,000,000 of miles, does not\r\nappear to be greater than the thickness of a spider’s thread, as seen\r\nfrom 61 Cygni, supposed to be the nearest of the fixed stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 231, p. 389.

The mass is found in the manner explained in the text;\r\nbut the method of computing the distance of the star may be made more\r\nclear by what follows. Though the orbit of the satellite star is really\r\nand apparently elliptical, let it be represented by C D O, fig. 14, for\r\nthe sake of illustration, the earth being in d. It is clear that, when\r\nthe star moves through C D O, its light will take longer in coming to\r\nthe earth from O than from C, by the whole time it employs in passing\r\nthrough O C, the breadth of its orbit. When that time is known by\r\nobservation, reduced to seconds, and multiplied by 190,000, which is the\r\nnumber of miles light darts through in a second, the product will be the\r\nbreadth of the orbit in miles. From this the dimensions of the ellipse\r\nwill be obtained by the aid of observation; the length and position of\r\nany diameter as S p may be found; and as all the angles of the triangle\r\nd S p can be determined by observation, the distance of the star from\r\nthe earth may be computed.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 234, p. 405. The mean results of MM. Argelander, Otto Struve, and\r\nLuhndahl for stars in the northern hemisphere and the epoch 1790, places\r\nthe point to which the sun is tending in 259° 5ʹ of right ascension and\r\n55° 23ʹ of north polar distance. Mr. Gallaway computed from stars in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, at the same epoch, the point to have been in 260°\r\n1ʹ right ascension and 55° 37ʹ north polar distance, results nearly\r\nidentical, though from very different data.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 235, p. 414. One of the globular clusters mentioned in the text is\r\nrepresented in fig. 1, plate 8. The stars are gradually condensed\r\ntowards the centre, where they run together in a blaze.

The motion of the earth is visibly proved by M.\r\nFoucault’s experiments. If a pendulum be left to oscillate quite freely,\r\nthe forces producing the oscillations being in the vertical plane, there\r\nis no cause that can produce an absolute change in its position with\r\nregard to space; but the motion of the earth changes the position of a\r\nspectator with respect to the vertical plane, and he refers his own\r\nmotion to it, which seems gradually to turn away from its position,\r\nprecisely as a person in a boat refers his own motion to that of the\r\nland, and thus the motion of the earth is truly and visibly proved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
