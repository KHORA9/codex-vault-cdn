At any moment a boa constrictor might drop like a flash from a\r\ntree above and seek to enfold him in its crushing coils. A turn of\r\nthe trail might bring him face to face with a crouching jaguar. Or a\r\ncooanaradi, deadliest of all venomous snakes, might launch itself from\r\nthe underbrush and inject its poison into his veins.\r\n\r\nThere were human foes, too, against whom Bomba had to be on his guard.\r\nWith the natives who dwelt in that part of the jungle he was on\r\ncomparatively friendly terms, though he never mingled with them on a\r\nfooting of intimacy.\r\n\r\nBut from time to time the dreaded headhunters from the faraway region\r\nof the Giant Cataract invaded this district in search of the hideous\r\ntrophies which their name implied wherewith to adorn their wigwams.\r\n\r\nTheir coming was a signal for the native inhabitants to flee, carrying\r\nalong with them their children and scanty household belongings. The\r\nheadhunters were cruel and ruthless, and death and destruction followed\r\nin their wake.\r\n\r\nBomba had seen signs of them that very morning, and he had no desire\r\nfor a closer acquaintance. On two previous occasions, he and Casson,\r\nthe aged naturalist with whom he lived, had been sought out by these\r\ndreaded savages and had narrowly escaped with their lives. A third time\r\nthey might not be so fortunate.\r\n\r\n“And as I have only one head, I am exceedingly anxious to keep it on my\r\nshoulders,” the boy had told Casson.\r\n\r\nSo it was with extreme caution that Bomba threaded his way through the\r\njungle, his eyes darting from right to left, plumbing the recesses of\r\nevery thicket, piercing the foliage of every tree. With him eternal\r\nvigilance was the price, not only of liberty, but of life itself.\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden rustling in the leaves of a giant dolado tree. Bomba\r\nhalted instantly, drew an arrow from his belt and fitted it to the\r\nstring of his bow.\r\n\r\nBut his tense attitude relaxed as the leaves were thrust aside and the\r\ngrinning, friendly face of a monkey framed itself in the opening.\r\n\r\n“Doto!” exclaimed Bomba, in accents of relief and pleasure, as he waved\r\nhis hand to the newcomer.\r\n\r\nWelcome was in the tone and gesture, and the monkey dropped from branch\r\nto branch, finally landing lightly on the ground. Its eyes gleamed with\r\naffection as Bomba caressed its head.\r\n\r\nThe boy--for he was no more than that, being fourteen years old at the\r\nmost--presented a striking picture as he stood there with a ray of\r\nsunlight falling athwart his face. He was taller than the average boy\r\nof his age and far more muscular and more sturdily built.\r\n\r\nFrom constant exposure to sun and storm, his face was as bronzed as\r\nthat of an Indian, but his features betrayed the fact that he was of\r\nthe white race. His eyes and hair were brown, his nose strong and\r\naquiline, and his firm jaw denoted courage and resolution.\r\n\r\nHe wore the mendiyeh, or native tunic, and across his breast was slung\r\na puma skin--that of Geluk, the puma, that he had come across and slain\r\nwhen it was trying to kill the friendly parrots, Kiki and Woowoo. His\r\narms and legs were bare, and showed the powerful muscles rippling under\r\nthe brown skin at every movement. On his feet were home-made sandals.\r\n\r\nIn his belt he carried a machete, a two-edged knife fully a foot in\r\nlength and ground to an almost razor-like sharpness. A pouch at his\r\nwaist held his arrows and a five-chambered revolver, the only firearm\r\nhe had ever owned, the gift of two white men whose camp he had saved\r\nfrom a night attack by jaguars.\r\n\r\n“So Doto is glad to see Bomba back!” said the boy as he fondled the\r\nanimal’s furry head. “And Bomba is glad to meet Doto again. Bomba has\r\nbeen away for many days and has seen many things. He has met men whose\r\nhearts are black. He has seen mountains break apart and fire come from\r\nthe top. Snakes and jaguars have tried to kill him.”\r\n\r\nThe monkey uttered sounds that would have been unintelligible to many,\r\nbut that Bomba knew were meant to express sympathy. The boy had an\r\nalmost uncanny power over animals, and had many friends among the less\r\nsavage denizens of the jungle, such as the monkeys and parrots. He\r\ntalked to them and they chattered back at him, and they had arrived at\r\na point where they could understand each other in simple things. Tone\r\nand gesture helped to interpret the words and sounds, and each knew\r\nintuitively whether the other were sad or glad and they shared emotions\r\nin common.\r\n\r\n“Bomba’s heart is heavy,” the lad went on, “for he has not done what\r\nhe wanted to do. He went to see Jojasta, the medicine man. He thought\r\nthe man could tell him about his father and mother. But Jojasta was\r\nkilled before he could tell Bomba what Bomba wanted to know. He told\r\nBomba something, but not enough.”\r\n\r\nThe lad was speaking more to relieve his own sore heart than anything\r\nelse, but Doto seemed to understand, and put his hairy paw consolingly\r\non the boy’s arm.\r\n\r\n“And now before many moons Bomba must go away again,” the lad resumed,\r\n“for Jojasta told Bomba that he must go to Sobrinini of the Pilati\r\ntribe, beyond the Giant Cataract, and that she could tell him about his\r\nfather and mother. It is a long way off, and there are many dangers in\r\nthe way. Bomba may never come back, may never see Doto again.”\r\n\r\nThe monkey uttered a wail and snuggled closer to Bomba as though\r\nin fear of immediate parting. The boy patted the animal’s head\r\naffectionately and roused himself from his musings.\r\n\r\n“Bomba must go fast,” he said. “He is on his way home to Casson. He has\r\nbeen away a long time, and he does not know whether Casson is alive or\r\ndead. So Bomba must hurry.”\r\n\r\nAs the lad started on in haste, Doto broke out into excited chatterings\r\nand clung to Bomba’s arm as though to hold him back.\r\n\r\nBomba knew at once that the animal was trying to warn him of\r\nthreatening danger, and he stopped short in his tracks.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Doto?” he asked.\r\n\r\nThere was another outbreak of sounds that would have been meaningless\r\nto anyone else, but which Bomba had no trouble in interpreting\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\nHis face grew grave as he listened.\r\n\r\n“I know,” he said. “The headhunters, the men with black hearts, are in\r\nthe jungle. I have seen their signs this morning. I thought that I had\r\ngot past them. But Doto, from the tops of the trees, can see farther\r\nthan I can. Where are these men with the bloody hands?”\r\n\r\nThe monkey pointed in front of them in the very direction Bomba was\r\ntaking.\r\n\r\nThe boy hushed the monkey’s chattering and stood silent as a statue,\r\nlistening.\r\n\r\nFrom his long experience in the jungle he had become preternaturally\r\nsharp of hearing. He knew all the sounds of the jungle and could\r\ninterpret them accurately.\r\n\r\nBut strain his ears as he might, he could detect nothing out of the\r\nordinary. There was the usual hum of insects, the occasional howl of a\r\nmonkey or shriek of a parrot. But there was nothing to indicate that,\r\nbesides himself, there was any human being in that part of the jungle.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at Doto with a look of inquiry, as though to ask if the\r\nanimal might not be mistaken. But Doto held to his arm with such a\r\nfrenzied clutch that Bomba decided to trust in the creature’s instinct\r\nor knowledge--or both.\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it. In spite of his eagerness to reach Casson,\r\nabout whose condition he was in a ferment of anxiety, he must make\r\na long circuit to avoid the region in which Doto had indicated that\r\ndanger lay.\r\n\r\nSo he changed his course, left the faint trail that he had been\r\nfollowing, and swung out in a sweeping semicircle, with every nerve at\r\ntension and every sense on the alert. With him went his friend, Doto.\r\n\r\nOn the route he was now pursuing there was no trail, and Bomba had to\r\nhack a way through the underbrush. This involved exhausting work and\r\nmade his progress slow. But most of all he dreaded it for fear that the\r\nnoise he necessarily made should attract the attention of lurking foes.\r\n\r\nAt times, when the brush was very thick, Doto would climb to the\r\nlowest branch of a tree and swing from one bough to the other of the\r\ninterlacing trees, and Bomba, who was almost as agile as the monkey\r\nhimself, followed his companion’s example.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, the jungle thinned a little, and they traversed the\r\nforest with redoubled speed in order to make up for lost time.\r\n\r\nAn hour had passed when Doto suddenly grasped the lad’s arm and pulled\r\nhim to the ground. At the same moment, an arrow whizzed over Bomba’s\r\nhead. A second later another arrow followed and buried itself in a\r\ntree, where it hung quivering.\r\n\r\nBomba’s enemies were upon him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAT GRIPS WITH DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nLike a flash, Bomba acted.\r\n\r\nHe knew that if he rose he would be offering himself as a target. At\r\nleast two of his foes were near at hand. There might be more.\r\n\r\nNot fifty feet away was a fallen tree, a veritable monarch of the\r\njungle, that he and Doto had made their way over with difficulty. Its\r\nbranches and foliage spread over a large area.\r\n\r\nTurning in that direction, keeping on hands and knees and motioning\r\nDoto to follow, Bomba made his way through the intervening thickets\r\nwith as much speed as possible.\r\n\r\nHad his enemies followed at once, Bomba would probably have been\r\ndiscovered and overtaken. But they were wary, and from previous\r\nexperiences of their fellows knew to what deadly effect Bomba could\r\nshoot. So, from their places of concealment, they waited for the target\r\nonce more to present itself.\r\n\r\nAnd when, a few minutes later, they were reinforced by some of their\r\nmates and rushed forward in a body to the place where Bomba had last\r\nbeen seen, their expected prey had vanished.\r\n\r\nBomba had utilized those few precious minutes to the utmost. Moving\r\nnoiselessly and yet rapidly, he had reached the vast mass of branches\r\nand ensconced himself in their furthest depths.\r\n\r\nHis concealment was aided also by the fact that the tree had fallen\r\nacross a hollow, so that there was a deep hole directly under the\r\ntrunk. Into this Bomba burrowed, crouching low so that his whole body\r\nwas hidden even should the branches and foliage be thrust aside by his\r\npursuers.\r\n\r\nHe had sent Doto off in another direction, as the monkey could be of no\r\nhelp to him if it came to a fight, and might by its chattering betray\r\nhis hiding place to his enemies.\r\n\r\nAnd now, with his heart beating rapidly but with his courage at the\r\nhighest pitch, Bomba waited for the coming of his enemies.\r\n\r\nHe knew that he was in desperate straits and that, if discovered, he\r\nwould be doomed. But before the end came he would do his utmost to take\r\nsome of his foes with him.\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of the boy that at this supreme moment he thought\r\nmore of Casson than of himself. He had so often faced death that it had\r\nlost most of its terrors.\r\n\r\nBut Casson! Poor, sick, half-demented Casson! What would become of him\r\nif anything should happen to Bomba, who had so long been his reliance\r\nand defender?\r\n\r\nIn that confined space the lad’s bow and arrows were of no use to him.\r\nBut he had his revolver fully loaded, and at such short range it could\r\nbe trusted to do deadly execution. And as a last resort, if it came to\r\na hand to hand fight, there was his machete, in the use of which he was\r\na master.\r\n\r\nBefore long he could hear his pursuers beating the bushes in the\r\nvicinity, giving utterance to grunts of rage as their search continued\r\nfruitless.\r\n\r\nHe held his breath and waited.\r\n\r\nThen he heard another sound, faint at first but gradually becoming more\r\ndefinite, a rustling as of some soft, long body slithering through the\r\nbrush.\r\n\r\nAt intervals there was a sound like a rattle, as though the creature\r\nhad encountered some obstacle that had aroused its irritation and was\r\ntaking this way of showing it.\r\n\r\nBomba knew that sound, and his heart skipped a beat.\r\n\r\nA snake was coming toward him, the deadly jaracara, the South American\r\nrattlesnake, the slightest puncture of whose fangs meant death!\r\n\r\nWhat should he do? He could not retreat. If he shot the reptile the\r\nnoise would bring his human enemies surging down upon him. If he\r\nattempted to use his machete, the snake’s stroke would be quicker than\r\nBomba’s blow, and the creature’s fangs would be imbedded in his flesh.\r\n\r\nWhile these thoughts were racing through his mind he saw the loathsome\r\nbody and the triangular head of the jaracara come into view not ten\r\nfeet away.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the reptile caught sight of Bomba. It stopped short\r\nin surprise. Then its eyes snapped with malignant fury. Like a flash it\r\nthrew its body into a coil and upreared its head to strike.\r\n\r\nBut in that short moment an inspiration had come to Bomba. He grasped\r\na long stick and prodded its coils. Instantly the snake struck at the\r\nstick. Before it could recover, Bomba had pounced upon it and his\r\nsinewy hands had closed upon its throat.\r\n\r\nThen ensued a terrific struggle, with the death of one or perhaps both\r\nof the combatants as the only possible outcome--a struggle all the more\r\nterrible for Bomba, because it had to be carried on in silence.\r\n\r\nAnd while he holds that slippery throat with the clutch of desperation,\r\nas the snake twists and writhes and tries to bite, it may be well, for\r\nthe benefit of those who have not read the preceding volumes of this\r\nseries, to tell who Bomba was and what had been his adventures up to\r\nthe time at which this story opens.\r\n\r\nFrom his earliest childhood, as far as his memory went, Bomba had\r\nlived with Cody Casson in the jungle. The latter was a naturalist, who\r\nhad withdrawn from civilization and settled in a little cabin in the\r\nremotest part of the Amazonian region. He was moody and abstracted, and\r\noften went for days at a time without speaking except in monosyllables.\r\n\r\nBut he was kind to Bomba, and a warm attachment existed between them.\r\nHe had started to give the boy the rudiments of an education. But one\r\nday, when Casson fired at an anaconda that was darting at Bomba, the\r\ngun burst and laid Casson on his back, while the wounded anaconda\r\nretreated. Bomba had dragged his injured companion to their cabin and\r\nnursed him back to physical health. But Casson’s head had been injured\r\nby the explosion, and from that time on he was half-demented, though\r\nharmless. The lessons ceased abruptly, and Bomba became the provider\r\nand protector of the little family of two.\r\n\r\nThrown thus early on his own resources, Bomba had developed into a\r\nremarkable physical specimen of boyhood, daring, strong, and versed\r\nin all the craft of the jungle. He was surrounded by daily perils, to\r\nwhich a weaker nature would have succumbed. Serpents and wild beasts\r\nsought his life. But against them he matched his own courage and\r\ncunning, and had so far survived.\r\n\r\nHe knew comparatively nothing of the outside world. The jungle filled\r\nhis whole horizon. But he knew that he was different from the natives\r\nof that region. Tugging at his heart was the knowledge that he was\r\nwhite, and he was possessed with a great desire to come in contact with\r\nhis own people, to learn of their ways and dwell among them.\r\n\r\nHe knew that he was out of place where he was. The call of the blood\r\nwas strong within him. He had a great longing to know of his parentage.\r\nHe had questioned Casson repeatedly on this point, and the old man had\r\nstriven in vain to tell him. But his memory had failed at the critical\r\nmoment, and all that he could do was to mention the names “Bartow” and\r\n“Laura,” which Bomba concluded must refer to his parents.\r\n\r\nHow Bomba met two white rubber hunters, Gillis and Dorn, and won\r\ntheir gratitude by saving their lives when their camp was attacked\r\nat night by jaguars; how he trapped the cooanaradi when it pursued\r\nhim; how he drove off the vultures when they assailed his friends the\r\nmonkeys; how the latter came to his aid when the cabin was besieged\r\nby the headhunters--these adventures are told in the first book of\r\nthis series, entitled: “Bomba the Jungle Boy; or, The Old Naturalist’s\r\nSecret.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Casson could not himself remember the facts about Bomba’s\r\nparentage, he told him that he could learn all he wanted to know from\r\nJojasta, the medicine man of the Moving Mountain. It was a long journey\r\nthat Bomba had in prospect to reach Jojasta, but the urge to go was\r\nso strong that the lad determined to attempt it. After beating off\r\nanother attack of the headhunters, Bomba took Casson down the river and\r\ndelivered him to the care of Pipina, an old squaw for whom he had done\r\nmany favors, and set out to find Jojasta.\r\n\r\nFrom the very start his journey was beset with dangers from man and\r\nbeast, flood and earthquake. He was instrumental in delivering from the\r\npower of the savages a Mrs. Parkhurst, whom he always referred to in\r\nhis mind as “the woman with the golden hair.” Later he found her son,\r\nFrank, and in their joint adventures the boys grew strongly attached\r\nto each other, and Frank’s stories of the wonders of civilization\r\nintensified Bomba’s longings to see those things for himself.\r\n\r\nHow Bomba was swallowed up in an earthquake and hurled into a\r\nsubterranean cavern that promised to become a living tomb; by what a\r\nmarvelous combination of nerve and good fortune he reached the open air\r\nand sunlight; how he finally found Jojasta after the latter had been\r\nfatally hurt by the fall of his temple; the partial but not sufficient\r\ninformation he received from the dying man regarding his parents; the\r\nobstacles he surmounted and the perils he escaped are told in the\r\npreceding volume of this series, entitled: “Bomba the Jungle Boy at the\r\nMoving Mountain; or, The Mystery of the Caves of Fire.”\r\n\r\nAnd now to return to Bomba, as he fights his life-and-death battle with\r\nthe snake amid the branches and foliage of the fallen tree, not daring\r\nto make a sound lest he betray his hiding place to the savages who were\r\nhunting for him only a short distance away.\r\n\r\nBeneath the scaly skin of the jaracara there was tremendous muscular\r\npower, and this was made more available when the reptile secured a\r\npurchase by wrapping its long body about the boy’s leg.\r\n\r\nIt squirmed and writhed and twisted, seeking to sink its fangs into the\r\nhands that held it. Its jaws, slavering with poison, were never more\r\nthan a few inches from the boy’s flesh. If Bomba’s hands should slip\r\nfrom that slimy throat ever so little, his doom would be sealed.\r\n\r\nThe snake knew this and redoubled its exertions. But Bomba knew it too,\r\nand held on with desperation, sinking his powerful fingers deeper and\r\ndeeper into the reptile’s throat.\r\n\r\nIf he could only hold on a little longer!\r\n\r\nFor time was on his side. The snake, deprived of breath by that choking\r\ngrasp, must eventually succumb. Its only chance lay in the possibility\r\nof Bomba’s hands slipping or his nerve failing.\r\n\r\nBut his hands did not slip nor did his nerve fail.\r\n\r\nGradually the struggles of the snake grew weaker. A glaze began to\r\nsteal over the horrid eyes. The grip of its body about the boy’s leg\r\nslowly relaxed. Then at last the reptile straightened out and its head\r\nhung limp.\r\n\r\nBomba still retained his grip for another minute or two to make\r\nassurance doubly sure. Then, when no doubt remained, he threw the\r\nreptile to the ground and with one stroke of his machete cut off its\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nOnly then did he sink down on the ground, panting and exhausted. The\r\ntax had been a tremendous one, not only on his muscles but also on his\r\nnerves. He had seldom been brought more closely face to face with death.\r\n\r\nBut he had conquered, and a tingle of exultation ran through his veins.\r\nHe cast a glance of disgust at the grinning head of his dead foe, and\r\nthen turned his attention to the human enemies without.\r\n\r\nThe struggle had been carried on in such silence that it had not\r\nattracted their attention. They were still at some distance, beating\r\nthe bushes for their prey and uttering exclamations of disappointment\r\nand chagrin.\r\n\r\nIt was too much to hope, however, that sooner or later their attention\r\nwould not be drawn toward the tree, and Bomba held himself prepared\r\nfor that eventuality.\r\n\r\nHe wiped his knife on the foliage and restored it to his belt. Then,\r\nwith his revolver held ready for action, he crouched low in the hollow\r\nand waited.\r\n\r\nHe could hear the savages coming nearer and nearer. The crackling of\r\nthe bushes and their guttural conversation became more distinct.\r\n\r\nThen the branches of the tree were pushed aside and a ray of light shot\r\nthrough!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nIN THE NICK OF TIME\r\n\r\n\r\nBomba caught a glimpse of half a dozen brawny forms and brutal faces\r\nand dropped at once into the hollow so that he was wholly concealed.\r\n\r\nA pang stabbed his heart as he noted the number of his enemies. Against\r\nso many he could not hope to conquer, if it came to a fight. He might\r\nbring down one or two, possibly three, but the others would overcome\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut his stout heart refused to quail. He had the advantage of position.\r\nHe could see them outlined against the light more readily than they\r\ncould discover him in the darkness. He could at least have the\r\nsatisfaction of selling his life dearly.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the savages crowded in among the foliage, pushing the\r\nbranches and leaves aside so that light could penetrate.\r\n\r\nBut the light was dim, though strong enough to show the outline of the\r\ngiant trunk. To the peering eyes of the savages, it seemed to be lying\r\nflat on the ground, and they failed to discern the hollow underneath.\r\nAs far as they could see there was no one hiding there.\r\n\r\n“Not here,” grunted one of them, already weary with previous effort in\r\nsearching the bushes.\r\n\r\nBomba’s heart leaped at this indication of giving up the search. But it\r\nsank again when a voice that had authority in it said:\r\n\r\n“Go in farther. Make sure.”\r\n\r\nGrumblingly the men obeyed, and Bomba could hear them coming nearer. He\r\ntightened his hold on the revolver.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a shriek of fright, and one of the savages jumped a\r\nfoot into the air. Then he made a break for the open, shouting:\r\n\r\n“Snake! Snake!”\r\n\r\nHis comrades followed, rushing with frantic, headlong haste into the\r\nclearing.\r\n\r\nIn a flash, Bomba, the jungle boy, comprehended what had happened. The\r\nintruder had stepped on the soft, yielding body of the dead serpent\r\nand had jumped to the conclusion that it was alive. Naturally, he had\r\nnot waited to investigate, but had leaped out of the reach of the\r\nsupposedly deadly fangs.\r\n\r\nNow he stood outside the mass of branches and was jabbering excitedly\r\nas he told of his narrow escape.\r\n\r\nThe examination of that particular mass of branches stopped then and\r\nthere. The men were reasonably certain, anyway, that their hoped-for\r\nvictim was not there, and they were perfectly content to leave the\r\nsnake in undisturbed possession.\r\n\r\nBomba could hear them moving farther and farther off until at last the\r\nsound of their footsteps and voices died away in the distance.\r\n\r\nHe could scarcely believe in his good fortune. He had steeled himself\r\nfor the conflict that seemed almost inevitable and from which he had\r\nnot expected to emerge alive.\r\n\r\nThe coming of the snake, which had filled him with horror, had really\r\nproved a blessing. Living, it had tried to kill him. Dead, it had\r\nhelped to save him.\r\n\r\nBomba lay in the hollow perfectly still for some time, fearing that his\r\nenemies might return. But when an hour had passed without any sound to\r\nalarm him, he ventured cautiously to creep toward the edge of the pile\r\nof branches and look about.\r\n\r\nHis keen eyes scanned the jungle in every direction, but could\r\ndiscern no trace of his enemies. He had known from the sound of their\r\nretreating footsteps that they were not between him and his goal. They\r\nhad gone in the direction that he had already traversed. That special\r\ngroup, at least, would now be in the rear of him instead of in front.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion was confirmed when Doto dropped down from a tree, where\r\nhis sharp eyes had noted all that had happened, and rubbed up against\r\nBomba, chattering his delight.\r\n\r\n“They have gone then, Doto?” asked Bomba, as he slung his bow over his\r\nshoulder. “They are far away?”\r\n\r\nThe monkey chattered an affirmative and pointed back of them.\r\n\r\n“It is well,” said Bomba. “I must go fast now to reach Casson. You\r\nsaved Bomba’s life, Doto. If you had not pulled him down the arrow\r\nwould have found him. Doto is good, and Bomba will not forget.”\r\n\r\nA gratified look came into the monkey’s eyes. He wanted to go along\r\nwith Bomba, but the latter did not think it best.\r\n\r\n“You stay here, Doto,” he said, as he gently released his arm from the\r\nmonkey’s hold. “Bomba will soon see you again.”\r\n\r\nThen, as the affectionate animal seemed a little crestfallen, the boy\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n“But you can keep watch, and if you see the men with black hearts\r\ncoming after Bomba, you must come and tell him. You can go faster\r\nthrough the trees than they can through the jungle.”\r\n\r\nDoto seemed to understand, and with a last pat of his paw shinned up\r\nthe nearest tree. Bomba knew that he had left behind him a vigilant and\r\nfaithful sentinel.\r\n\r\nA glance at the sun told the boy that it was already afternoon, and\r\nthat he must hasten if he were to reach the cabin of Pipina before the\r\nshadows of night closed about him.\r\n\r\nSo he started off at a rapid pace, employing all his woodsmanship to\r\navoid obstacles and steer as straight a course as possible. For a part\r\nof the way there were woodland trails, and then he made good time.\r\nWhen he could, which was often, he jumped over the thickets instead of\r\nhacking his way through them, leaping into the air as lightly as a deer\r\nand landing softly on the other side.\r\n\r\nBefore long he was on familiar ground, and knew that he was reaching\r\nthe cabin where he and Casson had lived for so many years. It had\r\nbeen burned during the last foray of the headhunters, and was now\r\nuninhabitable. But all that Bomba had ever known of home was bound up\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nSo a certain melancholy pleasure warmed his heart as he came out into\r\nthe clearing and looked at the part of the smoke-blackened wall that\r\nremained standing. Without being conscious of it, tears stood in his\r\neyes, and he vowed that he would rebuild when the headhunters should\r\nhave removed their dreaded presence from the jungle.\r\n\r\nBut he had no time now to indulge in reflections. A hasty search of\r\nthe river bank revealed his canoe in the tree-hung inlet where he had\r\nhidden it.\r\n\r\nHe untied it, sent it with a push into the middle of the stream, and\r\nbegan paddling down the river.\r\n\r\nIt was a long journey, but his powerful arms sent the canoe whizzing\r\nalong at a great pace. The current was with him, and he knew that,\r\nbarring accidents, he would reach the hut of Pipina before dark.\r\n\r\nBut “accidents,” he had come to learn, were almost daily occurrences\r\nin the jungle, and he did not abate a jot of his vigilance, his keen\r\neyes keeping on the lookout everywhere--at the water for snags or\r\nalligators, at either shore for animal or human enemies, on the trees\r\nthat overhung the stream for lurking anacondas.\r\n\r\nBut though always on the alert, his subconscious mind was busy with\r\nthoughts of his recent journey and of that which was to come. Would the\r\nlatter be more satisfactory than the former? Would Sobrinini complete\r\nthe story regarding the mystery of his parentage that Jojasta had left\r\nso incomplete?\r\n\r\nWho was Sobrinini? What did she know? And even if she did know, what\r\nwould she tell?\r\n\r\nDid Casson know her? Would the mention of her name unlock the door of\r\nhis memory, that door that he had tried so desperately but fruitlessly\r\nto open?\r\n\r\nBut here Bomba’s questioning stopped as the thought came to him\r\nthat perhaps there would be no Casson to tell him anything. The old\r\nnaturalist had been so weak and frail when he had left him! His hold\r\non life had been so slender! Perhaps the thread had already snapped.\r\n\r\nThe thought was an agonizing one to Bomba, and spurred him to such\r\nefforts that the paddle swept in a wide semicircle as he propelled his\r\nslight craft through the water.\r\n\r\nAt such a rate of speed did he travel that long before he had expected\r\nhe found himself in the vicinity of his goal.\r\n\r\nWhen he realized that Pipina’s cabin lay beyond a turn of the river\r\njust ahead, Bomba slackened speed. His habitual caution, bred of long\r\nyears in the jungle, asserted itself. He wanted to inspect the cabin\r\nbefore approaching it.\r\n\r\nSo, despite his impatience, he rested from his paddling and let the\r\ncraft drift with the current until he rounded the bend.\r\n\r\nWhat he saw then made him dip his paddle deep and send the canoe in\r\nfrantic haste toward the shore.\r\n\r\nBefore the door of the cabin crouched a huge puma, preparing for a\r\nspring through the doorway!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nA TERRIFIC STRUGGLE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt sight of the crouching brute, Bomba shouted with all his might.\r\n\r\nThe beast turned at the shout, fangs bared and eyes flashing with\r\nrage, to meet the newcomer. Then, with its tail lashing its flanks, it\r\nadvanced toward the river bank.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment a roar came from within the cabin. And with the roar\r\nwas blended the scream of a woman in mortal terror.\r\n\r\nAs the canoe approached the bank, Bomba fitted an arrow to his string,\r\ndrew it to the head and let it go.\r\n\r\nThe haste with which he shot and the motion of the boat disturbed his\r\naim, so that it just grazed the animal’s head, inflicting a slight\r\nflesh wound, but no mortal injury.\r\n\r\nBut the pain inflamed the puma’s rage, and as the canoe had now come\r\nwithin a few feet of the bank, it prepared to spring.\r\n\r\nBut just as it was about to launch itself into the air a second arrow\r\nfrom Bomba’s bow struck fair to its heart.\r\n\r\nWith a fearful howl the beast rolled over and over for a moment, then\r\nstraightened out and lay still.\r\n\r\nWith scarcely a second glance at his dead adversary, Bomba leaped on\r\nthe bank and started to run toward the cabin.\r\n\r\nThe hut consisted of two rooms, a larger one in the front and a much\r\nsmaller one in the rear. A flimsy door with one rope hinge broken\r\nconnected the two.\r\n\r\nIn the swift glance he sent inside as he reached the outer doorway,\r\nBomba saw no trace of human occupants.\r\n\r\nWhat he did see was a puma, larger than the one he had slain outside,\r\nclawing at the inner door between the two rooms and at times hurling\r\nits huge body against the door. It was a dilapidated door at the best,\r\nand would long since have yielded to the beast’s attack had it not been\r\nfor some barriers placed against it on the other side.\r\n\r\nBomba took in the situation in an instant. Pipina had seen the beasts\r\napproaching and, taking Casson with her, had retreated to the inner\r\nroom, shut the door, and piled against it whatever furniture she could\r\ngather in her frantic haste.\r\n\r\nBut that it was pitifully inadequate was apparent at a glance. Already\r\nthere were breaks in the door that the puma was trying to enlarge with\r\nits claws so that it could push its body through. From the other side\r\nof the door came the frantic screams of Pipina, seeing death so near at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nIn a flash Bomba fitted an arrow to his bow and let it go. It struck\r\nthe puma in the shoulder, inflicting a serious wound but not enough to\r\ncripple it.\r\n\r\nWith a roar of rage the brute turned to meet its new enemy. With one\r\nspring it was at the door.\r\n\r\nThe movement had been so lightning fast that Bomba had no time to shoot\r\nagain. His only salvation lay in flight.\r\n\r\nTurning, he ran like a deer toward the river bank, hoping to regain\r\nhis canoe and push out into the stream. But even as he did so he felt\r\nthat it was hopeless. He was fleet, but the puma was fleeter. Before he\r\ncould reach the water it would be upon him.\r\n\r\nJust then he saw out of the corner of his eye a third puma coming with\r\ngiant bounds into the clearing. Then indeed he gave himself up for lost.\r\n\r\nHe drew his knife, determined to die fighting. That he was about to die\r\nhe had no doubt.\r\n\r\nBut just as he felt the hot breath of his pursuer on his neck there was\r\na terrific snarling behind him and the impact of huge bodies.\r\n\r\nHe glanced behind him and his flight suddenly halted.\r\n\r\nThe two great pumas were locked in deadly combat, clawing and biting,\r\nrolling over and over as each sought to get a grip on the other’s\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nIt was a battle of Titans, and Bomba looked on with amazement that was\r\ntransformed into an expression of delight as he recognized the last\r\ncomer.\r\n\r\n“Polulu!” he exclaimed. “Good Polulu! He has come to Bomba’s help.”\r\n\r\nHe circled about the combatants, seeking to get in a thrust with his\r\nknife that might decide the battle in favor of the friendly puma. But\r\nthe fight was so fast and furious that he was as likely to wound one as\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nBut Polulu needed no help. His weight and courage finally told. Before\r\nlong he succeeded in getting the throat hold he was seeking, and then\r\nthe end was only a matter of a few moments.\r\n\r\nBut it had been a terrible fight, and after Polulu had risen from the\r\nbody of his dead adversary he was hardly able to move. He staggered\r\naway a few paces, and then lay down panting and exhausted.\r\n\r\nBomba let him rest awhile, and then went up to him and caressed the\r\ngreat, shaggy head.\r\n\r\n“Polulu is a good friend,” he said gratefully. “It is not the first\r\ntime he has saved Bomba’s life. There is no one in the jungle as big\r\nand strong as Polulu.”\r\n\r\nThe puma tried to purr, and licked the hand that fondled him.\r\n\r\nTheir strange friendship was of long standing. It dated from the time\r\nwhen Bomba had come across the puma trapped by a tree in the jungle,\r\nthat had fallen upon the animal and broken its leg. The boy of the\r\njungle had been stirred to pity at the creature’s distress. He had\r\nreleased him from the weight that held him, bound up the broken leg,\r\nand brought him food and drink.\r\n\r\nBy the time Polulu, as Bomba named the puma, had fully recovered, a\r\nstrong attachment had grown up between the oddly assorted pair. Their\r\npaths often crossed in the forest, and more than once the great beast\r\nhad saved Bomba from serious danger. Now, once more, he had come to the\r\nrescue when the lad was at the last extremity.\r\n\r\nLeaving the animal to lick its wounds, Bomba hastened to the hut.\r\nIts inmates had no inkling of what had happened except that for some\r\nmysterious reason the attacks upon the door had ceased. The screams of\r\nthe woman had given place to moaning.\r\n\r\n“Pipina! Casson!” shouted Bomba. “It is Bomba calling. The pumas are\r\ndead. Open the door.”\r\n\r\nAgain there came a scream, but this time it was one of delight. There\r\nwas a hurried removal of the barriers on the other side of the door,\r\nand then the old squaw came rushing out and threw her arms about\r\nBomba’s neck, crying and laughing in the same breath.\r\n\r\nBehind her came Cody Casson, his steps slow and uncertain, looking so\r\nfrail that it seemed as though a zephyr would have blown him away, but\r\nwith an affectionate welcome in his faded eyes.\r\n\r\nBut he was still alive, and at that moment nothing else mattered. Dear\r\nCasson! Good old Casson! There were tears in Bomba’s eyes as he rushed\r\nforward and folded the old man in his embrace.\r\n\r\nThe two were roused by a shriek from Pipina, who had gone to the\r\ndoorway and now came rushing back in terror.\r\n\r\n“There is another puma there!” she cried. “He is bigger that the\r\nothers! Quick! Let us get behind the door again.”\r\n\r\nBomba spoke to her soothingly and with a smile.\r\n\r\n“He is not like the others,” he said. “He is Bomba’s friend. I killed\r\none puma but he killed the other. I will bring him here, and you will\r\nsee.”\r\n\r\nBut Pipina, despite Bomba’s assurances, had no desire for an\r\nintroduction to the giant puma, and shook her head decidedly, the while\r\nshe muttered prayers to her gods.\r\n\r\nSo Bomba had to be content with bringing out a haunch of meat and\r\nsitting beside Polulu and talking to him, while the latter munched away\r\ncontentedly. Then the great beast rose, stretched himself, rubbed his\r\nhead against Bomba’s hand, and departed again for his haunts in the\r\njungle.\r\n\r\nThey had a great feast that night, for Pipina displayed all her skill\r\nin making a fitting celebration of the wanderer’s return.\r\n\r\nBomba was almost famished, and ate greedily while Pipina beamed with\r\nsmiles at his tribute to her cooking. The lad was glad to see also that\r\nCasson had a better appetite than he had had when Bomba had left him.\r\nIt was evident that Pipina had taken good care of him.\r\n\r\nBut though the old naturalist had improved physically, there was no\r\nchange for the better in his mental condition. Bomba studied him during\r\nthe meal and grieved to see that his mind was still weak and wandering.\r\nWould that closed door in his mind never open?\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was finished and Pipina was busy with clearing away the\r\nfood that was left and performing her simple household tasks, Bomba sat\r\ndown beside Casson and told the story of his journey.\r\n\r\nCasson listened, holding Bomba’s brown hand affectionately in his weak,\r\nworn one, happy beyond words to have the boy back again with him. But\r\nit was with difficulty that the old man kept the thread of the story.\r\nAt times he would interpose vague, irrelevant questions that showed how\r\nhard it was for him to understand.\r\n\r\n“I saw Jojasta,” said Bomba, “but it was too late. He was dying.\r\nA pillar of the temple fell on him. And then the earth opened and\r\nswallowed him.”\r\n\r\n“Jojasta? Jojasta?” repeated Casson, in a puzzled way. “Oh, yes, he was\r\nthe medicine man of the Moving Mountain. But why did you want to see\r\nJojasta?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you remember?” asked Bomba. “You told me that if I saw him he\r\ncould tell me about my father and mother.”\r\n\r\n“Father and mother,” murmured Casson, and lapsed into silence, during\r\nwhich he seemed to be cudgeling his poor, disordered brain to make it\r\nyield up its secrets.\r\n\r\n“He thought I was Bartow when he saw me,” went on Bomba.\r\n\r\nAt the name the old man brightened.\r\n\r\n“Bartow!” he exclaimed. “I have heard that name.”\r\n\r\n“Is he my father?” asked Bomba eagerly.\r\n\r\nCasson tried desperately to remember.\r\n\r\n“I--I don’t know,” he said at last piteously.\r\n\r\nBomba’s heart sank, but he tried again.\r\n\r\n“I asked him about Laura, too,” he went on, watching Casson narrowly.\r\n\r\n“Laura, dear sweet Laura,” murmured the old man with emotion, tears\r\ncoming to his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Who is she? Where is she? Oh, tell me, Casson!” Bomba begged, with all\r\nhis heart in his voice.\r\n\r\n“She is--she is--oh, why is it that I cannot remember?” exclaimed\r\nCasson in desperation.\r\n\r\n“Jojasta knew. Jojasta could have told you,” the old man went on after\r\na pause. “But you say that he is dead.”\r\n\r\n“He is dead,” replied Bomba. “But before he died he told me that\r\nSobrinini----”\r\n\r\nThen came a startling interruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTERRIBLE JAWS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the mention of Sobrinini’s name Cody Casson sprang to his feet,\r\nhis weakness temporarily banished, and began to dance around the\r\nroom, singing in a cracked, treble voice “la, la, la!” over and over\r\nagain. Not until he was exhausted did he cease his gyrations and sink\r\nquivering into his chair.\r\n\r\nBomba watched the sudden transformation with consternation and alarm.\r\nWhat did this strange outbreak mean?\r\n\r\nBut he forebore to question until Casson ceased trembling and became\r\nonce more like his customary self. Then the boy leaned toward the old\r\nman and said gently:\r\n\r\n“I was talking about Sobrinini.” Again the old man started, but did not\r\nrise. Bomba went on:\r\n\r\n“Jojasta told me to go to Sobrinini, she of the Pilati tribe beyond the\r\nGiant Cataract, to find out about my father and mother.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Nini ought to know,” muttered Casson. “She ought to know.”\r\n\r\n“Who is Sobrinini and why should she know?” asked Bomba.\r\n\r\nBut Casson did not answer. He sat, muttering incoherently, and seemed\r\nso tired from his recent excitement that Bomba was afraid to press the\r\nmatter further.\r\n\r\nSo he tried to calm the old man’s agitation and a little while later\r\nassisted him into his hammock where he almost immediately fell asleep.\r\n\r\nBomba himself got into his own hammock and tried to sleep. But although\r\nhe was dead tired, he found himself for a long time unable to close his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nHe tossed restlessly about, his mind in a tumult of unanswered\r\nquestions. Why was it that Casson had betrayed such intense excitement\r\nat the mention of Sobrinini’s name? Why had he referred to her as Nini?\r\nThat sounded to Bomba like a pet name, implying long acquaintance\r\nand familiarity. Why did he indulge in that wild fantastic dance and\r\nsinging?\r\n\r\nOne thing was reasonably certain. It was hopeless to count much on\r\nCasson. The disjointed words that his questioning had brought from the\r\nold man could not be pieced together so as to give him any reliable\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nSo he must go to Sobrinini, must face all the dangers that would\r\ninevitably await him in that long journey to the Giant Cataract. The\r\nthought of abandoning his quest did not even occur to him. The urge\r\nto find out about his parentage was, if possible, stronger than it had\r\nbeen before. No difficulties could daunt or deter him.\r\n\r\nWith his determination firmly fixed in his mind, he fell at last into\r\nan uneasy slumber.\r\n\r\nHe found plenty of work awaiting him when he woke in the morning. In\r\nthe first place, he had to replace the door that had been so nearly\r\nshattered by the puma, so that Casson and Pipina could have better\r\nprotection, if exposed to similar dangers in the future.\r\n\r\nHe spent much time and labor on this, and when a stout door was at last\r\ncompleted, together with a heavy bar that could be dropped into place,\r\nhe felt much easier in his mind.\r\n\r\nThen there was the problem of provisioning the cabin during his coming\r\nabsence. Though Casson and Pipina had had plenty while he was gone,\r\ntheir stock was now greatly depleted and needed replenishing. So he\r\nplanned to spend several days in the jungle in order to bring them\r\nhome plenty of meat. This would be cured by Pipina and would keep\r\nindefinitely.\r\n\r\nIt was bright and early one morning that he bade Casson and the woman\r\nfarewell and set out for his hunting trip in the jungle.\r\n\r\nSo far as he could learn, the headhunters had left that district. He\r\nhoped they would stay away a long time, preferably forever.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone far before Kiki and Woowoo, the friendly parrots,\r\nfluttered from the trees and dropped one on each shoulder. A little\r\nlater Doto joined him together with other monkeys, so that he was soon\r\nthe center of a group of birds and animals, all competing for a word or\r\na pat of the hand.\r\n\r\nHe talked to them, and they chattered back. Then he took out his\r\nharmonica and played for them, to their great delight. So much did the\r\nlonely boy enjoy converse with those who loved him that it was with\r\nreluctance he finally sent them away, so that he could go on with his\r\nhunting.\r\n\r\nTwo hours passed without anything coming in range of his weapons save\r\nsmall creatures that he disdained to notice. He was after larger game,\r\npreferably a tapir, a creature as large as a calf, whose meat was\r\nsucculent and nourishing. A single one of these would furnish meat\r\nenough for a month.\r\n\r\nSo he turned his steps toward a large river where he knew these animals\r\nwere likely to be found.\r\n\r\nFor a long time he had no luck. The sun reached its zenith and dropped\r\ndown toward the western sky. There were plenty of tracks, but it was\r\nmid-afternoon before he caught a glimpse of what he sought.\r\n\r\nThen, coming out from a fringe of trees not far from the river’s edge,\r\nhe saw a large tapir browsing on the bank.\r\n\r\nIt offered an easy target, and Bomba fitted an arrow to his bow. But\r\nunfortunately the wind was blowing toward the tapir and carried Bomba’s\r\nscent with it.\r\n\r\nThe animal looked up, saw Bomba, and without an instant’s hesitation\r\nplunged into the river.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily that would have ended Bomba’s chances, for the tapir can\r\nswim for a long distance under water. His game, therefore, could easily\r\nhave got beyond bowshot before it would have been compelled to come to\r\nthe surface for air.\r\n\r\nThe boy gave an exclamation of vexation, which was checked, however, as\r\nhis eyes, ranging up and down the river bank, caught sight of a canoe\r\ndrawn up among some sedge grass near the shore. No doubt it belonged to\r\na native who had left it there while he made a trip into the jungle.\r\n\r\nBomba ran to it, untied it, seized the paddle, and pushed out into the\r\nstream, following as nearly as he could guess the direction that the\r\ntapir had taken.\r\n\r\nBut a stern chase is a long chase, as Bomba soon found. When the tapir\r\ndid come to the surface, it was a long way from where Bomba imagined\r\nit would be, and before he had come within range of it the beast had\r\ngone under again.\r\n\r\nBut Bomba’s second guess proved a better one, and the next time the\r\ntapir came to the surface the boy was within ten feet of it.\r\n\r\nBomba dropped his paddle and seized his weapon. The bow twanged.\r\n\r\nThe arrow penetrated to the heart of the animal, and it died almost\r\nwithout a struggle.\r\n\r\nSeizing a rope that lay in the bottom of the canoe, Bomba made a noose\r\nand threw it around the head and shoulders of the tapir, securing it\r\nbefore it could sink. Then he tied the other end of the rope to the\r\ncanoe, and set out for the shore, towing his quarry behind him.\r\n\r\nIt was an arduous task, for the tapir weighed several hundred pounds,\r\nand Bomba made slow progress through the water. But his heart was\r\nexultant, for he had bagged his game. His day had not been fruitless.\r\n\r\nHis progress was checked suddenly, so suddenly that he was thrown on\r\nhis back on the bottom of the canoe.\r\n\r\nHe scrambled to his feet and looked back, thinking that the body of\r\nthe tapir might have caught on a snag. At what he saw his heart almost\r\nstopped beating.\r\n\r\nIt was no snag that had checked the progress of the canoe.\r\n\r\nA monster alligator, the cayman of the Amazon region, was tugging at\r\nthe tapir, from which it had already torn a piece of the flank.\r\n\r\nThen, as Bomba looked, the water was broken in several places by the\r\nhorrid snouts and hideous jaws of other caymen, that had smelled the\r\nblood of the tapir and were hastening to have their share of the feast.\r\n\r\nBomba’s first feeling was that of chagrin at losing his prey. But this\r\ngave way at once to an overpowering sense of his own danger.\r\n\r\nThose great jaws tearing at the tapir were sure to upset the canoe. He\r\nmust cut the rope.\r\n\r\nHe drew his machete, sprang to the stern, and commenced to hack madly\r\nat the rope. Before he could cut through a single strand, there was a\r\nterrific jerk, the canoe turned over, and Bomba was thrown into the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nBy this time the river was swarming with alligators!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPURSUED BY AN ALLIGATOR\r\n\r\n\r\nBomba was hurled headlong into the green depths of the river. This in\r\nitself would not have bothered him. He could swim like a fish and was\r\nalmost as much at home in the water as on land.\r\n\r\nBut a thrill of terror passed through him as he realized that not far\r\naway was a group of monsters that could swim faster than he could, and\r\nwhose terrible jaws, once clamped on him, could bite him in half.\r\n\r\nHis mind worked with lightning swiftness. He must remain under water as\r\nlong as possible. His instinct for direction told him where the land\r\nlay.\r\n\r\nSo instead of permitting himself to shoot up to the surface, he\r\nremained under and struck out toward the shore.\r\n\r\nFor more than a minute he shot ahead at a rapid pace. And only when\r\nit seemed as though his lungs would burst did he at last rise to the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nHe shook the water from his eyes and looked behind him. He could see at\r\nleast half a dozen caymen tearing at the body of the tapir and others\r\nswimming about greedy for their share.\r\n\r\nHis only hope lay in the possibility that the brutes would be so busy\r\nfighting each other for a portion of the spoils that they would not\r\nnotice him at the distance that he had already attained.\r\n\r\nBut his chase for the tapir had carried him far out into the stream and\r\nthe shore seemed still a terrible distance away.\r\n\r\nHe summoned up all his resolution and struck out for land, keeping\r\nhimself as low in the water as possible and moving with scarcely a\r\nripple.\r\n\r\nFor a time it looked as though his hope might be realized. Twice he\r\nlooked behind him, and each time the brutes still seemed to be fighting\r\nabout the body of the tapir.\r\n\r\nBut the third time he looked back he saw something that filled him with\r\nconsternation.\r\n\r\nA huge alligator had detached itself from the group and was making\r\ntoward him at full speed. He could see the long, scaly body, the fiery,\r\nred eyes and the hideous jaws with their rows of glistening teeth.\r\n\r\nBomba turned and swam for his life.\r\n\r\nAs the lad swam he measured the distance to the shore. He knew that the\r\nalligator was coming at a faster pace than his own, but he hoped that\r\nthe start he had gained might yet enable him to reach the shore before\r\nthose terrible jaws should close on him.\r\n\r\nIt was a close calculation, but he decided that he had a chance. He put\r\nredoubled power into his strokes and swam as he had never swum before.\r\n\r\nBut his heart sank as he noted how steep the bank was at the nearest\r\npoint. Had the shore been shelving, he might have been able to find a\r\nfooting when the water grew shallower and rush up on land before the\r\ncayman could reach him.\r\n\r\nBut the bank was three or four feet high and ran straight up and down.\r\nHe would have to reach up, grasp the edge and pull himself up. And he\r\nrealized only too well that before he could do this the alligator might\r\nhave caught him.\r\n\r\nIn his heart Bomba felt that he was doomed.\r\n\r\nBut his indomitable spirit refused to give up. He called to his aid all\r\nhis reserves of force and swam on. As a last resort he had his knife.\r\nHe could stab with it, perhaps hold off for a moment the vicious rushes\r\nof his foe. But as against a knife, of course the alligator would\r\nconquer in the end.\r\n\r\nOne last glance Bomba cast behind. The cayman had made up much of\r\nthe distance between them and was now fearfully close. A minute more\r\nperhaps and then----\r\n\r\nBomba cast one farewell look at the sky and felt for his knife.\r\n\r\nBut as he looked upward, something brushed across his face. It was the\r\nbranch of a tree that hung far out over the water.\r\n\r\nA ray of hope cut through the blackness of the boy’s despair. With the\r\nquickness of a cat, he grasped the branch and swung himself up on it\r\nout of the water. Even as he did so, he heard beneath him the snap of\r\nthe alligator’s jaws.\r\n\r\nBut those awful jaws missed the boy by a hair’s breadth. The speed at\r\nwhich the brute was going carried it several yards farther before it\r\ncould turn. And by that time, spurred on by dreadful necessity, Bomba\r\nhad climbed farther up on the heavy bough and was out of reach.\r\n\r\nThe rage of the baffled man-eater was fearful to witness. It churned\r\nthe water into foam and emitted frightful bellowings as it leaped\r\nhalf out of the water, trying to reach the prey of which it had been\r\ncheated. It gnashed its teeth and its red eyes gleamed with fury.\r\n\r\nFor a full half hour Bomba lay extended on the branch, feeling with\r\nunspeakable relief and delight the strength come back into his muscles\r\nand vitality creep into his exhausted frame.\r\n\r\nThe alligator still kept up its watch, and Bomba wondered why. Did it\r\nnot know that its quarry had escaped? Then he realized that the brute\r\nwas not so stupid after all.\r\n\r\nFor the alligator is a land as well as a water animal, and though its\r\nprey had baffled it for a while, it knew that the boy, soon or late,\r\nwould have to descend the tree. And when Bomba should slide down the\r\ntrunk to the ground, his enemy meant to clamber up the bank and be\r\nwaiting at the foot of the tree to receive him.\r\n\r\nLuckily Bomba’s bow was still slung over his shoulder and his arrows\r\nwere at his belt. His immersion had been so sudden that he had not had\r\ntime to discard them. They had hindered him in his swimming, but now he\r\nblessed the fact that they were with him.\r\n\r\nHis position was a difficult one to shoot from, for he would have to\r\nuse both hands for his bow and depend on his sense of equilibrium to\r\nkeep him secure on the branch. If he should lose his balance, he would\r\ntopple into the water, and he shuddered to think what would happen\r\nafter that.\r\n\r\nHe solved his problem in part by wrapping both legs closely around the\r\nbough. Then he fitted an arrow to his string and took careful aim.\r\n\r\nHe knew that about the only vulnerable part of the alligator was the\r\neye. An arrow striking anywhere else would simply rebound from the\r\ntough hide without inflicting any material damage.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before Bomba could get a good view of his target. The\r\ncayman kept swimming about with its head half submerged in the turbid\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nBut at last the alligator lifted its head and glared at the boy. At the\r\nsame instant Bomba shot.\r\n\r\nThe arrow went straight to its mark, pierced the creature’s eye and\r\npenetrated to the brain.\r\n\r\nThere was an awful bellow and a tremendous thrashing about for a few\r\nmoments. Then the alligator slowly sank below the surface of the river.\r\n\r\nBomba waited for some time, but the body did not reappear. The arrow\r\nhad done its work well.\r\n\r\nOnce fully convinced of this, the boy made his way to the trunk of the\r\ntree and slid down it to the ground.\r\n\r\nIt was good to feel the earth again beneath his feet. His heart swelled\r\nwith gratitude. True, he had been cheated. The alligators had robbed\r\nhim of his tapir. But they had not robbed him of his life, and compared\r\nwith that fact everything else seemed insignificant.\r\n\r\nThe sun was near its setting now, and his hunting would have to be\r\ndeferred to the next day. Soon the four-footed hunters of the jungle\r\nwould themselves be abroad, and it behooved Bomba to make himself safe\r\nfor the night.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily he would have collected brush and made a fire, trusting to\r\nthe flames to keep wild beasts at bay. But now, owing to the possible\r\npresence of the dreaded headhunters in the jungle, he dared do nothing\r\nthat would betray his presence to the marauders. He had not detected\r\nany signs of them so far, but a sort of sixth sense told him that they\r\nhad not yet returned to their homes above the Giant Cataract.\r\n\r\nHe gathered some jaboty eggs which he ate raw, and which, with some\r\ncured meat he had brought with him from the cabin of Pipina, made a\r\nsimple but satisfying meal.\r\n\r\nThen he cast about for some place in which he could pass the night.\r\n\r\nHe found it in the center of a dense thorn thicket, into which he\r\npenetrated slowly and with great care, pushing the thorny stalks aside\r\nso that they would not wound his flesh. Once in the center, he beat\r\ndown enough of the brush to serve him as a bed, and covered it with\r\nbunches of soft moss that he had gathered near the river’s edge.\r\n\r\nHere he was safe. Even if his scent betrayed him, no wild beast was\r\nlikely to venture through the thorns. And if, perchance, some prowling\r\nbrute, more daring or hungry than the rest, should try it, the noise\r\nmade would awaken the boy at once and he could trust to his weapons for\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nAs he lay there, waiting for sleep to come, his thoughts were tinctured\r\nsomewhat with bitterness. Why should his life be in constant peril?\r\nWhy should he be doomed to be hunted by beast and reptile?\r\n\r\nIt was not as though he were a native of the jungle. Then he might have\r\naccepted his lot as the decree of fate and borne whatever came to him\r\nwith stolidity, if not with resignation.\r\n\r\nBut his real place was not there. He was white. He was heir to all the\r\ninstincts, traditions and ambitions of his race. He belonged elsewhere.\r\nThen why was he here? Why were his aspirations and longings doomed to\r\nbe thwarted? What had he done to deserve such a fate?\r\n\r\nHis thoughts turned to Frank Parkhurst. What a difference there was\r\nbetween their lots! No doubt by this time Frank had reached one of the\r\ncities he had talked about and whose wonders had so deeply stirred the\r\njungle boy. To-night Frank would be sleeping safely in a soft bed. He\r\nwould have abundance of good food. He would be laughing and talking\r\nwith others of his kind. And his mother, the woman with the golden\r\nhair, would print a good-night kiss upon his lips.\r\n\r\nBut Bomba had no mother near him to kiss him good-night. He had no\r\nfriends to talk to, to clap on the shoulder in jovial fashion, as\r\nGillis had done to Dorn. Monkeys and parrots were his only intimates,\r\nexcept poor demented Casson and the squaw, Pipina.\r\n\r\nAs to laughter--when had Bomba last laughed? He could not remember.\r\n\r\nIn this melancholy mood he at last fell asleep.\r\n\r\nBut his depression vanished when he awoke the next morning. His sleep\r\nhad been undisturbed. Weariness had departed. The current of his blood\r\nran swiftly through his young veins. The skies were azure. It was good\r\nto be alive.\r\n\r\nAnd his optimism was increased by the good fortune that for the next\r\ntwo days attended his hunting. Tapirs, deer, agouti and other game fell\r\nbefore his arrows, until he had accumulated enough to supply the cabin\r\nfor weeks to come.\r\n\r\nA good deal of his time was consumed in skinning the animals. He could\r\nnot carry them home bodily, as he had no means of conveyance except\r\nhis sturdy shoulders. So he cut off the choicest parts, wrapped them\r\nin great leaves tied with bush cord, and on the third day after he had\r\nleft the cabin set out on his return.\r\n\r\nAll this time he had kept a sharp lookout for the headhunters. But\r\nduring the whole of the hunting trip he had come across no signs of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHe would have felt easier in his mind, however, if he had occasionally\r\nmet some of the friendly natives that ordinarily dwelt in that region.\r\nThey, too, were conspicuous by their absence. If the headhunters had\r\nreally gone, why had not the natives returned to their usual haunts?\r\n\r\nThe answer was not far to seek. Those dreaded invaders were probably\r\nstill lurking somewhere in the district, and if Bomba had not crossed\r\ntheir trail, it was simply a bit of good fortune.\r\n\r\nA sense of impending calamity grew upon him as he neared his\r\ndestination. The burden on his shoulders was heavy, but it was matched\r\nby the burden on his heart.\r\n\r\nHe tried to throw off his depression, assuring himself that it was due\r\nto weariness. Soon he would reach the cabin, be once again with Casson\r\nand Pipina, and all would be well. So he communed with himself, though\r\nnot with much conviction.\r\n\r\nThe journey back to Pipina’s hut was made in rapid time, the jungle boy\r\nbeing spurred on by his anxiety.\r\n\r\nHe turned the bend of the stream from which he could see the hut,\r\nand an exclamation of relief escaped him as he saw that it was still\r\nstanding. He had half-feared that he would find it burned or demolished.\r\n\r\nBut it was there, and everything about it seemed placid and serene. No\r\npuma this time ranged before the door. It seemed an abode of peace.\r\n\r\n“Bomba was a fool,” he told himself, as he hurried forward.\r\n\r\nHe gave the loud halloo with which he was accustomed to announce his\r\ncoming. Usually this brought either Casson or Pipina to the door at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nThis time his call evoked no answer. No figure appeared at the doorway,\r\nnor could he hear any stirring within.\r\n\r\nHe called again, this time in louder tones. But again there came no\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nHis uneasiness returning at this unusual circumstance, he hastily ran\r\nup to the hut.\r\n\r\nThe door stood open and a hurried glance into the outer room showed\r\nthat it was empty.\r\n\r\nHe rushed in and examined the farther room. No one was there.\r\n\r\n“Casson!” he called in a frenzy of anxiety. “Casson! Pipina! Where are\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\nHis only answer was the echo of his voice.\r\n\r\nCasson was gone! Pipina was gone!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCARRIED INTO CAPTIVITY\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment Bomba stood stupefied with dread. Then he ran out into the\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nHe beat the bushes about the hut. He dashed down to the edge of the\r\nygapo, his quick eye scanning the expanse for some sign of the passing\r\nof Casson and Pipina.\r\n\r\nNothing anywhere. No footprints, no trampling of the bushes, no clue to\r\nguide him in a search for the missing ones.\r\n\r\nTo all appearances no one had trodden that deserted spot since Bomba\r\nhad returned from his journey to the Moving Mountain.\r\n\r\nYet Casson was gone. Pipina was gone.\r\n\r\nBomba retraced his steps to the hut, his mind in a ferment of\r\nbewilderment and grief.\r\n\r\nIndians! Only Indians could traverse the jungle with the silence and\r\nstealth of ghosts, leaving no trace behind.\r\n\r\n“Nascanora!” The word hissed between the boy’s clenched teeth. “This is\r\nyour work! If you have killed Casson, Bomba will not rest until he has\r\nfound your heart with an arrow, a bullet, or a knife!”\r\n\r\nThe boy reëntered the empty hut with a sharp pain stabbing at his\r\nheart. He would search the cabin more minutely now for some sign, some\r\nclue, to the whereabouts of the absent ones. And if he could not find\r\nit there, he would call into play all his skill in woodcraft to find\r\nand follow their trail. For trail there must be somewhere. They could\r\nnot have vanished into thin air.\r\n\r\nInch by inch, he scrutinized the walls, the floor, even every crevice\r\nof the crude and meagre furniture, thinking he might find some message\r\nfrom Casson. It was almost a forlorn hope, but it was all that he had\r\nat the moment.\r\n\r\nHe had nearly abandoned even this hope, however, when he discovered\r\na faint scrawl on the wall in the darkest corner of the hut. He bent\r\ncloser, and his brows drew together in a scowl as he tried to decipher\r\nthe writing.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly a hoarse cry of rage escaped him. His eyes blazed in the\r\nshadowy hut like those of an angry puma.\r\n\r\nFor this was what he read:\r\n\r\n  “_Nascanora is taking away Casson, Pipina, Hondura to camp near Giant\r\n  Cataract. Come. Help._”\r\n\r\nSo the headhunters had achieved their end at last! They had captured\r\nthe helpless old man whom their superstition had led them to regard\r\nas a Man of Evil, a magician whose spells had brought blight on their\r\ncrops and sickness to their people. Poor old Casson, whose one desire\r\nwas to help rather than hurt!\r\n\r\nThey would torture him. They would make him a sacrifice to their gods.\r\nAnd when flesh and blood could no longer stand their torments, they\r\nwould kill him and place his head on the wigwam of their chief.\r\n\r\nBomba’s rage was terrific, and it would have fared ill with the savage\r\nchief if at that moment he had come within reach of the boy’s knife.\r\n\r\nThe boy read the scrawl again. So they had taken Hondura too, the\r\nfriendly chief of the Araos tribe, the father of the pretty little\r\ngirl, Pirah, who had once saved Bomba’s life!\r\n\r\nWhy had Nascanora made Hondura captive with Casson and the squaw? Was\r\nit because Hondura and his tribe had been on friendly terms with Bomba\r\nand the old naturalist? Or did Nascanora think that the Araos tribe\r\nwas becoming too powerful, and had he hoped by depriving them of their\r\nchief to render his people helpless and throw confusion and panic into\r\ntheir hearts?\r\n\r\nBut that problem could be left till later for solution. The pressing\r\nthing was to plan for the rescue of the captives before they were so\r\nfar away that their recovery would be impossible.\r\n\r\nWhen his first fury had exhausted itself, Bomba left the writing on the\r\nwall and sat down on the threshold of the hut, the better to think out\r\na course of action.\r\n\r\n“Near the Giant Cataract” said that rude scrawl penciled by poor\r\nCasson, when the attention of his captors was momentarily diverted.\r\nBomba had no clear idea as to how far away that was or what direction\r\nwould have to be followed to reach it. But from what he had gathered\r\nfrom the natives from time to time, the place was at a great distance,\r\nand he knew that a long and arduous journey lay before him.\r\n\r\nThat is, if he had to go that far in order to catch up with the raiding\r\nparty. There was nothing in the hut on which he could base any judgment\r\nas to the time the capture had taken place.\r\n\r\nIt might have occurred the very day that he had left on his hunting\r\ntrip. In that case, they would have had a three days’ start of him.\r\nOr again it might have happened yesterday. In that event, his task of\r\novertaking them would be that much easier.\r\n\r\nNo matter how much they wanted to hurry, no large party could proceed\r\nvery fast, encumbered as they were with prisoners and probably laden\r\nwith spoils. Bomba could cover as much ground in one day as they could\r\nin two or possibly in three. So he had little doubt of his ability to\r\novertake them before they could get very far.\r\n\r\nWhat he would do if he should come up with them, he did not pause\r\nto consider. No plan formed now would be of any service. He must be\r\nguided by circumstances as they developed. But he had enough confidence\r\nin his own quick wit to believe that he would be able to shape such\r\ncircumstances to meet his ends.\r\n\r\nBut time pressed, and he could spend no more time in reflection. He\r\nrose to his feet and secured some cured meat from Pipina’s stores to\r\nfeed him on the way. He would have no time to spend in hunting food\r\nwhen there were human enemies requiring his attention.\r\n\r\nHe tested his bow, put a new string on it, and replenished his store of\r\narrows. His revolver and machete were already at his belt. He took one\r\nmore look about the cabin to make sure he had overlooked nothing and\r\nplunged into the jungle.\r\n\r\nLike a hound when trying to pick up a trail, he described a long\r\ncircle, scanning the ground narrowly for every sign that might indicate\r\nthe direction in which the party had gone.\r\n\r\nFor a long time his search was unsuccessful. At last his eyes\r\nbrightened, for they rested on a little strip of cloth fluttering on a\r\nthorn bush. He examined it carefully and recognized it as a strip torn\r\nfrom a loose dress such as the Indian women wear. Probably it was torn\r\nfrom Pipina’s garment.\r\n\r\nThis was something, but not enough. He must find a second strip, if\r\npossible, and the line formed by the two would give him the direction\r\nin which the party were traveling.\r\n\r\nBefore long his eager search was rewarded. Now he could shape his\r\ncourse, and he hurried forward with redoubled speed.\r\n\r\nThe bits of cloth also told the jungle boy another story. The fact that\r\nthey had been torn off at all showed that the savages had been hurrying\r\ntheir captives along at great speed, and so roughly that they took no\r\ncare to avoid the thorn bushes that tore the clothes and probably the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nBomba’s heart burned within him as he pictured poor, weak Casson\r\ndriven along, perhaps flogged to make him hasten. How long could he\r\nendure such treatment in his feeble condition? Perhaps even now he had\r\nsuccumbed to the hardships of the journey! Bomba gritted his teeth and\r\nhis eyes flamed with fury.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone far when his jungle instinct warned him of danger in\r\nthe immediate vicinity. Motions as vague as shadows, faint rustlings\r\nthat could not have been detected by an untrained ear, told him that\r\nsomething or someone was trailing him, keeping step with him, moving\r\nas swiftly and silently as he. From being the hunter, he had become the\r\nhunted.\r\n\r\nWhen Bomba paused the slight rustlings stopped. When he moved on they\r\nwere resumed.\r\n\r\nStill he continued on his way. Whether his pursuer were beast or human\r\nhe could not tell. But the jungle lad knew that, whether beast or\r\nhuman, the surest way to provoke attack was to betray a knowledge of\r\nhis danger.\r\n\r\nTo keep on would be at least to delay attack and perhaps derange the\r\nplans of his pursuer. But when the attack at last came--if it should\r\ncome--he would be ready.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he became conscious that he was encircled. The faint sound,\r\nwhich had been behind him, was echoed now on the right and the left and\r\nin the front. His enemies, whoever they were, were closing in upon him.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing that his eyes could tell him. Not a leaf stirred\r\nnor was there any movement in the brush. There was only that ghostly\r\nrustling that to Bomba’s sensitive ears was as plainly perceptible as\r\nthe rumbling of distant thunder.\r\n\r\nThen something shaped itself, vague and dim behind a thicket. Like a\r\nbeast at bay, Bomba crouched, pulled his bow from his shoulder and\r\nplucked an arrow from his pouch.\r\n\r\nBefore he could fit the arrow to the string a hideous chorus of shouts\r\nrent the air, and like magic the jungle was filled with men, men with\r\nthe ferocious faces of demons, who rushed upon him, shouting and\r\nbrandishing their sharp, murderous knives above their heads.\r\n\r\nBomba had no time to turn and flee. He dropped his bow, whipped out\r\nhis machete and backed toward a tree, only to feel himself seized from\r\nbehind and borne helpless to the ground.\r\n\r\nA score of natives bent above him, their faces menacing, their knives\r\npointed at his throat.\r\n\r\n“Hondura?” grunted one of them. “Where is he?”\r\n\r\nA light dawned upon Bomba. These were braves of the Araos tribe seeking\r\ntheir leader. They blamed him, Bomba, for the disappearance of their\r\nchief--Bomba, who at that very moment was on his way to rescue that\r\nchief from captivity.\r\n\r\n“Let me up and I will tell you,” he said, refusing to quail before the\r\nfierce eyes directed upon him.\r\n\r\nThey hesitated, evidently suspicious of some trick. But finally the\r\nleader, a strapping native named Lodo, whom Bomba remembered having\r\nseen on his recent visit to their village, ordered that a close ring be\r\nformed about the lad. Then he ordered him to stand up.\r\n\r\nBomba did so, and Lodo advanced toward him, knife in hand, his gaze\r\nlowering.\r\n\r\n“Where is Hondura, our chief?” he demanded. “You hide him.”\r\n\r\n“The bad chief, Nascanora, take good chief, Hondura, prisoner,” Bomba\r\nreplied, his brown eyes holding the little, shifting ones of Lodo with\r\ngreat earnestness. “He take, too, my friend Casson and Pipina, the\r\nsquaw. Come with me to the hut, and I will show you the writing on the\r\nwall.”\r\n\r\nIt was plain that the Indians considered this a subterfuge or a trap,\r\nand there was considerable parleying before Lodo finally announced that\r\nthey would take him to the hut.\r\n\r\n“But you fool us, Bomba,” threatened Lodo with a suggestive twist of\r\nhis knife, “and I cut out your heart--so!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE MAN WITH THE SPLIT NOSE\r\n\r\n\r\nBomba raged within himself at this enforced delay in his journey. But\r\nresistance against such odds would be nothing less than suicide.\r\n\r\nAnd apprehension was in his heart as he moved along with his captors.\r\nHe was by no means sure that he would be able to prove to the natives\r\nthat he spoke the truth concerning their chief.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the only proof he had was that writing on the wall, and if\r\nthey thought that he was trying to deceive them they might regard the\r\nwriting as part of his plan. There was no likelihood that any of them\r\nwould be able to decipher it for themselves.\r\n\r\nSo it was with no great confidence as to the ultimate outcome that he\r\nmade his way back to the cabin, surrounded by the lowering bucks of the\r\nAraos tribe and feeling the suspicious gaze of Lodo boring into his\r\nback.\r\n\r\nThey traveled swiftly, as the way was familiar, and it was not long\r\nbefore they reached the deserted hut. Bomba led them into it and\r\npointed out the faint scrawl on the wall.\r\n\r\nLodo could make nothing of it, and looked from the writing back to\r\nBomba with a fierce scowl and a tightened grasp upon his knife.\r\n\r\n“You read,” he said, and the cruel point of the knife pricked Bomba’s\r\nbare shoulder and brought a tiny trickle of blood. “No fool Lodo.”\r\n\r\nBomba read the words twice under Lodo’s direction, and still the giant\r\nwas unconvinced. The other bucks patterned their conduct on his and\r\ncrowded around Bomba, muttering and growling like beasts of the jungle\r\nabout to close in on a helpless prey.\r\n\r\n“You lie!” The point of Lodo’s knife pricked again at Bomba’s shoulder,\r\ndeeper this time, and a red stream followed it.\r\n\r\nStill Bomba did not flinch, giving the sullen Indian look for look\r\nwithout a sign of fear.\r\n\r\n“You lie!” again shouted Lodo, working himself into a frenzy of fury.\r\n“Braves see Hondura near the hut of Casson, the white medicine man.\r\nHondura not come back to his people. Bomba hide Hondura. Bomba must\r\ndie!”\r\n\r\nHis knife was upraised in menace. A shudder of anguish passed through\r\nBomba, but he said no word. A dozen hands reached out to seize him, a\r\ndozen knives were pointed at his throat----\r\n\r\n“Wait!” A guttural voice came from the doorway of the hut, and Grico,\r\nhe of the one eye and the split nose, forced his way through the ring\r\nof angry Indians. “Let me see writing on the wall. I tell you if Bomba\r\nlie.”\r\n\r\nGrico was a native of tremendous physical strength. He had for a while\r\nlived in one of the towns on the coast, and as a boy had been taken\r\nunder the care of an English missionary school. Here he had been taught\r\nthe rudiments of education. But the call of his jungle blood had proved\r\ntoo strong to be resisted, and he had run away and thrown in his lot\r\nwith the Araos tribe.\r\n\r\nThere, when he reached manhood, he became known as the swiftest runner\r\nand the greatest hunter of them all. He had lost one eye and acquired\r\nhis split nose in a battle with jaguars, in which he had shown almost\r\nsuperhuman strength and courage.\r\n\r\nHe had become therefore a person of great influence in the tribe,\r\nnot only because of his prowess as a hunter but also because of his\r\nknowledge of the world outside and his education, which gave him\r\ngreat superiority over his ignorant and simple-minded mates. And he\r\nwas cunning enough to make this count for all that it was worth and\r\nconsiderably more, considering that, after all, he had gained only the\r\nmerest smattering of learning.\r\n\r\nBomba knew something of the history of Grico, and hope sprang in him\r\nanew as the giant caboclo made his way through the sullen group and\r\npeered at that faint scrawl upon the wall. Slowly he read the words\r\naloud:\r\n\r\n  “_Nascanora is taking away Casson, Pipina, Hondura to camp near Giant\r\n  Cataract. Come. Help._”\r\n\r\nThen he turned to the Indians, his one eye gleaming at them in a\r\ncontemptuous manner.\r\n\r\n“Bomba speaks truth,” he said. “Those are the words he said, and that\r\nis the writing on the wall. Take the point of your knife away, Lodo.\r\nThe boy is right. Chief Hondura has been taken away by the wicked\r\nNascanora. We will capture Nascanora and tie him to a tree and pile the\r\nbrushwood up about his knees and with flint and stone make red flames\r\nthat will lick at his flesh and bones. Ayah! Ayah!”\r\n\r\nThe cry of vengeance, indescribably weird and savage, was taken up\r\nby the Indians and filled the jungle with a long wailing shriek that\r\nchilled the blood of Bomba as he thought of what might have happened to\r\nhim had it not been for Grico’s timely appearance.\r\n\r\nOnce their enmity was turned from him, the Indians became as friendly\r\nand pleasant as they had been savage a few moments before.\r\n\r\nOne of them found a bit of native cloth in the hut and bound it about\r\nthe wound in Bomba’s shoulder. Then they squatted outside the hut to\r\nhold a council and decide upon plans for the rescue of their chief.\r\n\r\nWhile the Indians talked in their guttural language, sometimes\r\nsitting for many minutes of silence between their laconic sentences,\r\nBomba fretted and fumed, eager to be once more on the trail of the\r\nheadhunters.\r\n\r\nHowever, he could not risk offending Lodo and his braves, who might\r\nprove valuable helpers in his quest, by going off too abruptly. So he\r\nwaited, answering as best he could the questions that Lodo and Grico\r\nput to him from time to time.\r\n\r\nHe told them of the previous visits of the headhunters to Casson’s\r\ncabin, how he had beaten off their attacks, how he had wounded\r\nNascanora himself, how he had captured Ruspak, their medicine man, and\r\nhow in the jungle he had overcome the braves of Tocarora.\r\n\r\n“I think there are two bands of headhunters,” he said, when asked\r\nfor his opinion. “Nascanora is at the head of one, and Tocarora, his\r\nhalf-brother, leads the other. They will join each other somewhere in\r\nthe jungle. Then Nascanora will be strong enough to fight the Araos if\r\nthey come looking for their chief.”\r\n\r\n“But they did not think of Grico!” said he of the split nose, his one\r\neye gleaming balefully. “Grico will get other braves who will fight\r\nwith the Araos to get back Hondura. Hondura has been good to Grico.\r\nGrico will show that he is grateful.”\r\n\r\nBomba knew that this was no idle boast. Grico’s courage was so well\r\nestablished that he would have no trouble in rallying many bucks of\r\nother tribes under his leadership. If he could do this, the Araos\r\nand their auxiliaries would prove formidable enemies, even to the\r\nredoubtable headhunters.\r\n\r\nBut Bomba knew that this would take time and be the subject of\r\ninnumerable powwows before the avengers would get fairly started. And\r\nwith the knowledge he had of Casson’s danger he was in no mood for\r\ndelay. He must go on. They could follow later.\r\n\r\nHe knew the risks he ran in going alone. He would be only one against\r\nthe hordes of Nascanora. But his wit had served him so often where mere\r\nforce would have failed that he was willing and eager to trust to it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nSo when a favorable opportunity presented, he broached his plan to his\r\nnew-found allies.\r\n\r\n“Bomba will go first and try to find the trail while Lodo and Grico are\r\ngetting their braves together,” he said. “If Bomba finds them near by,\r\nhe will come back and tell you, so that you may come and fight them. If\r\nhe finds they are far off, he will leave a trail of his own so that you\r\nmay move fast through the jungle. Does Bomba speak well?”\r\n\r\nLodo and Grico consulted.\r\n\r\n“Bomba speaks well--” Lodo was beginning when there was a sudden\r\ncommotion in the surrounding jungle. A moment later a strange company\r\nbroke into the clearing.\r\n\r\nBomba saw that they were squaws of the Araos tribe. The faces of the\r\nwomen, usually so stolid, wore the ghastly gray of terror. They had\r\ncome from afar and swiftly, for their flesh was torn by thorns and\r\nspiked vines and their breath came in gasps.\r\n\r\nOne of them, who was the squaw of Lodo and seemed to be the leader of\r\nthe women, came over to her husband and stood before him, striving to\r\nregain breath enough to speak.\r\n\r\n“What is it, woman?” cried Lodo. “What has happened?”\r\n\r\n“The maloca,” she got out at last. “Bucks come. They burn our houses.\r\nThey carry off the women. They take the children. All gone.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE SAVAGE RAIDERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news fell with stunning effect upon the assembled bucks already\r\nwrought up to a high pitch of fury because of the capture of their\r\nchief. There was a hubbub of exclamations of grief and rage.\r\n\r\n“Pirah gone, too,” declared the woman, with a sweeping gesture of her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“Pirah!” This was Bomba’s voice, harsh and unlike his own, as he pushed\r\nthrough the group of scowling Indians. “You say Pirah taken too? Who\r\nwere the bucks?”\r\n\r\n“No know.” The squaw shook her head. She had recovered her breath now,\r\nand, with the other women, was regaining her habitual stolid look.\r\n“They come--many come.” She extended her ten fingers, closing and\r\nopening her hands several times to indicate an indefinite number. “Take\r\nwomen. Take children. We run away. Hide in bushes till they go. Then we\r\ncome here.”\r\n\r\nHer story roused the Indians even more than the loss of their chief.\r\nThat their native village, or maloca, should have been invaded, their\r\nwomen and children carried off, was a crime that by their code merited\r\nonly one punishment, and that torture and death.\r\n\r\nThe powwow broke up at once and the braves hurried away to their\r\nmaloca, taking their women with them.\r\n\r\nBomba accompanied them for some distance, and then took leave of them,\r\npromising to pick up the trail at once and coöperate with them in every\r\nway possible in the rescue of their chief and kidnapped families, as\r\nwell as of Casson and Pipina.\r\n\r\nThen he left them to return with heavy and angry hearts to their\r\ndespoiled maloca while he again sought out the path he had been\r\npursuing when the onrush of Hondura’s enraged braves had put such an\r\nabrupt stop to his journey.\r\n\r\nHis heart was sorer now than ever, for it was torture to him to think\r\nof the pretty little Pirah, the daughter of Hondura, who had once\r\nsuccored him, in the clutches of the evil Nascanora. For in his own\r\nmind Bomba did not doubt that the same hand that had directed the\r\ncapture of Hondura had also ordered the despoiling and burning of the\r\nchief village of the Araos.\r\n\r\nBomba could but remember that on his onetime visit to the Araos tribe,\r\nwhen his life had been in danger from the suspicion of Hondura and\r\nhis braves, it had been little Pirah who had stood between him and a\r\nhorrible fate, and by her innocent friendship had changed enmity to\r\nconfidence and trust.\r\n\r\nAnother fact stood out from the story brought by the Araos squaws. It\r\nwas that the headhunters must be present in large force, or they would\r\nnot have dared thus to challenge the wrath of the most powerful native\r\ntribe of the district.\r\n\r\nProbably the opinion he had voiced to Lodo and Grico had been the\r\ncorrect one. Nascanora was probably at the head of one band and\r\nTocarora of another. The scrawl on the wall had told him that it was\r\nNascanora in person who had raided the cabin of Pipina. While he was\r\nthus engaged, Tocarora had probably assailed the maloca. Later on, the\r\ntwo bands would have met to form a formidable combination.\r\n\r\nIf this were true, it would make Bomba’s task all the harder. But he\r\ncared little for this. His heart was on fire with rage. In his present\r\nmood no danger could daunt him.\r\n\r\nThen again he must rescue poor Cody Casson, no matter how difficult\r\nthe undertaking. First, there was the love and gratitude the boy felt\r\nfor his benefactor, but if the enemy should kill the old naturalist,\r\nBomba was afraid that the last hope of clearing up his own identity--of\r\nfinding out about his father and maybe other relatives--would be gone\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nSo, having once more picked up his trail, he went on at a swifter and\r\never swifter pace, tormented at every step by fears of what might be\r\nhappening at that very moment to his friends at the hands of the evil\r\nchief of the headhunters.\r\n\r\nOne thought, however, brought him a little comfort. He knew the\r\nboastful nature of the savages. Nascanora would want to exhibit his\r\ncaptives to the women of his tribe who had been left at home. He would\r\nbe eager to impress them with his power. They, too, must have their\r\nshare in the horrid festival that would end in the torture and death of\r\nmost of his victims and the reduction to slavery of the others.\r\n\r\nSo the lives of the captives were probably safe until the headhunters\r\nhad reached their dwelling-place above the Giant Cataract. Bomba would\r\nbe in time to save them, avenge them, or, at the worst, to die with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours passed and Bomba had made remarkable progress before he\r\nstopped for a few minutes to rest and eat.\r\n\r\nAs he felt in his pouch to draw out a portion of cured meat, he made a\r\nstartling discovery.\r\n\r\nHis revolver and harmonica were missing!\r\n\r\nBomba could scarcely believe this at first, nor accept it as a fact\r\nuntil he had searched every recess of his pouch and quiver. He even\r\nretraced his steps for some distance through the jungle, in the hope\r\nthat his treasures might have slipped out and that he could recover\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut he could find no trace of the magic music or the precious “fire\r\nstick,” and at last he came back to the clearing to ponder and mourn\r\nhis loss.\r\n\r\nThat loss to him was very great. He had so few treasures that he\r\ncherished them fondly. The harmonica had brought him soothing and\r\ncomfort in many lonely hours. The revolver had been the white men’s\r\ngift, and therefore doubly precious. Moreover, it was a very important\r\npart of his equipment. On occasion it might mean all the difference\r\nbetween life and death. His offensive power was sensibly weakened. Now\r\nhe had only his knife and his bow and arrows.\r\n\r\nBut his treasures were gone, in all likelihood irrecoverably gone.\r\nWhere and how had he lost them?\r\n\r\nA thought that crossed his mind swiftly changed his mood from mourning\r\nto anger.\r\n\r\nHe remembered that Grico, he of the one eye and the split nose, had\r\ncome close to him and jostled him several times, as though by accident,\r\nduring his journey through the jungle. At the time, Bomba had thought\r\nit chance. Now he saw in it design. Perhaps it was Grico who had robbed\r\nhim of his treasures.\r\n\r\nGrico, to be sure, had saved his life, and for that Bomba was grateful.\r\nThe fact modified the anger that assailed him. Still he vowed that, if\r\nhis suspicions were correct, he would get that revolver and harmonica\r\nback. He would pay the debt he owed Grico in some other way.\r\n\r\nHe was meditating gloomily upon his loss when his attention was\r\nattracted by a slight rustling in the underbrush.\r\n\r\nSwift as thought, he fitted an arrow to his bow and stood on the alert.\r\n\r\nHe could dimly see the form of some animal, and not knowing but what it\r\nmight be a jaguar, he shot. The law of the jungle, he had learned, was\r\nto shoot first and investigate afterward.\r\n\r\nThere was a startled grunt, a floundering about in the bushes, and then\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nBomba crept forward cautiously, prepared for a second shot, but relaxed\r\nwhen he saw lying dead before him a peccary, the wild pig of the jungle.\r\n\r\nHe was not especially pleased at this, for the peccaries usually\r\ntraveled in droves and companions of the dead one might be near at\r\nhand. As a rule, he gave the animals a wide berth, for nothing is more\r\nferocious than the peccaries, whose murderous tusks, if they get to\r\nwork, can tear a man into ribbons.\r\n\r\nSo he waited for a while, close to a tree up which he could climb if\r\nthe drove bore down upon him.\r\n\r\nBut none appeared, and Bomba came to the conclusion that this was a\r\nyoung pig that had wandered from the drove and lost its way in the\r\njungle.\r\n\r\nThe roast pig makes delicious eating, and Bomba did not neglect the\r\nunexpected gift that had come his way. It offered an agreeable change\r\nfrom the dried meat on which he had expected to dine. So he cut a steak\r\nfrom the choicest part, roasted it over a fire of twigs, and soon was\r\nfeasting on a dish that kings might envy.\r\n\r\nHow he wished that Frank Parkhurst was with him to share the feast!\r\nBefore he had met with the white people he had been lonely, but he had\r\nnot so keenly sensed his loneliness. Now it was ever present with him.\r\n\r\nThe friendship he had formed with Frank was the most precious thing\r\nthat had so far come into Bomba’s starved life--except, perhaps, the\r\nmeeting with the woman of the golden hair, Frank’s mother.\r\n\r\nIt had made still more deep and strong the urge that was on him to hold\r\nfellowship with his kind. For he was white--as white as Frank himself.\r\nYet fate had thrown the two boys into environments that were as widely\r\nseparated as the poles.\r\n\r\nChicago, Frank had called the city in which he lived. Bomba wondered\r\nwhether he would ever see that strange and wonderful city or others\r\nlike it, wondered if he would always have to spend his life in the\r\njungle, with none save Casson and a few natives for his friends, to\r\nnone of whom he could speak of the longings that obsessed him, of the\r\naspirations that seemed doomed forever to be thwarted.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to himself half aloud:\r\n\r\n“I am not as well off as the beasts and reptiles of the jungle. They\r\nlive together and have plenty of their own kind. They do not hunt and\r\nlive alone as I do. The monkeys gather in flocks, the wild peccaries\r\nhunt in droves. Even the big cats, the hungry jaguars, have their\r\ncompanions. Why am I, Bomba, always alone? I do not belong here in\r\nthe jungle, which is the only place I know. And I cannot go to the\r\nwonderful world where Frank and other boys and many people live and\r\nlaugh and slap each other on the back. Where do I belong? Where is\r\nthere a place for me?”\r\n\r\nBut nothing answered that desolate cry that came from the very depths\r\nof the boy’s heart.\r\n\r\nHowever, Bomba soon aroused himself from these unhappy musings. A\r\ncertain oppression and unusual stillness in the jungle warned him\r\nthat a storm was imminent. In the distance he could hear faintly the\r\nrumbling of thunder.\r\n\r\nHe girded himself and resumed his journey, his heart heavy, but his\r\nbody refreshed and strengthened by the hearty meal he had eaten. For\r\nsome time he had failed to pick up any direct clues of those he was\r\npursuing. But he was now reasonably sure of the direction they had\r\ntaken and pressed confidently forward.\r\n\r\nHis footsteps had been directed toward the river, since that offered\r\nthe shortest route to the region of the Giant Cataract. Now, however,\r\nhe struck deeper into the jungle, not caring to be caught in a raging\r\ntorrent if the river should overflow its banks. He remembered how\r\nnearly he and Mrs. Parkhurst had been overwhelmed by the waters while\r\nthey were escaping from the Indians, and he had no wish to repeat the\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nHe quickened his pace, leaping over many of the obstacles in his\r\npath instead of cutting his way through them. He did not want to be\r\ncaught in the open during the storm that seemed to be gathering. If a\r\nwind accompanied it, there would be a rain of castanha nuts from the\r\nbranches, and many of these were big and heavy enough to kill anyone\r\nthey struck.\r\n\r\nHe must find shelter of some kind. He knew of the existence of a cave\r\nnot far away. If he could reach this, he would be safe until the storm\r\nabated. Fortunately the tropical tempests, though fierce while they\r\nlast, are not of long duration, and Bomba knew that he would not be\r\ndelayed long on his journey.\r\n\r\nThe storm was gathering with frightful rapidity. Now it was a race\r\nbetween the boy of the jungle and the elements. The roar of the thunder\r\ncame closer. Jagged sheets of lightning shot athwart the sky. The\r\nwind tore through the jungle, shattering the ominous silence that had\r\nprevailed into jangled discords of sound.\r\n\r\nThe trees bent before that furious onslaught. Parrots, monkeys and\r\nother denizens of the jungle scurried to shelter.\r\n\r\nThe castanha nuts were ripped from their fastenings, and their thuds\r\nblended into a menacing chorus as they struck the ground.\r\n\r\nOne of these heavy missiles in falling grazed Bomba’s shoulder, sending\r\na thrill of pain through his arm.\r\n\r\nThe cave was now not far away, but the wind was pressing with terrible\r\nforce against Bomba’s straining muscles. Flailing, sharp-thorned vines\r\nwhipped about his head, stinging, half-blinding him. His breath seemed\r\ntorn from his gasping lungs, to be borne off mockingly on the wings of\r\nthe terrible blasts.\r\n\r\nStill Bomba’s muscles were iron and he forged forward doggedly,\r\nignoring the thorns that tore at him, the roots that tried to trip him\r\nup, the vines that sought to strangle him.\r\n\r\nHe was closer--closer--only a short distance now, and he would be able\r\nto drag himself into the welcome shelter of the cave.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, as the tidal wave tops all other waves, came a gigantic\r\nburst of wind that bore great trees before it as though they had been\r\ntoys, bending them, breaking them, uprooting them, whirling them about\r\nas in a fantastic dance.\r\n\r\nThe force of that blast bore Bomba backward, pinning him against a\r\ngreat tree, with all the breath knocked out of his body. At the same\r\ntime there came a ripping, tearing sound, a rumble and a roar that vied\r\nwith the crash of the thunder.\r\n\r\nSomething struck Bomba--he had no time to see what--swept him from the\r\nground as though he had been a feather, and dropped him many feet away\r\nwith a force that drove all consciousness from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nIN DEADLY PERIL\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Bomba slowly came to himself, fighting his way through\r\nunconsciousness, he did not realize at once the full significance of\r\nhis plight.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, he knew that he was drenching wet--probably it had\r\nbeen the beating of rain upon his face that had brought him back to\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nThe heavens had opened, and a deluge of rain had descended on the\r\njungle, filling the dry beds of the ygapos as though by magic,\r\noverflowing the banks of the streams so that along their shores twin\r\ntorrents raged.\r\n\r\nBomba had been swept by the branches of a falling tree into a deep\r\nhollow in the ground. The jungle abounded with these miniature pools,\r\ntheir bottoms only a muddy ooze at most times, the hollows only full\r\nafter a rainfall or the overflowing of some stream in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nBomba wondered dully if he had been seriously injured, perhaps crushed,\r\nin the fall. There was no feeling in his body, and at first he was\r\ntoo dazed to test his strained muscles. He seemed to himself like a\r\ndisembodied ghost.\r\n\r\nBut as the rain continued to fall upon his upturned face, fuller\r\nconsciousness returned to him. He viewed his situation with more active\r\nalarm, tried to move his hands and feet and raise himself from his\r\nconfined position.\r\n\r\nThis effort ended in a feeling of almost complete discouragement. His\r\nfeet and legs were powerless. They might have been cut from his body,\r\nfor all the good they were to him. He could not even raise himself\r\nsufficiently to look and see if they were still there.\r\n\r\nBranches of the fallen tree pinioned him as securely to the ground as\r\nthough he had been bound by iron cords. There was a stifled oppressed\r\nfeeling in his chest, and it hurt him to draw a long breath.\r\n\r\nHis left arm, seemed dead. It possessed no more feeling than the lower\r\npart of his body. His right arm and hand seemed numb and almost useless\r\nat the start. The arm was doubled under him, and Bomba thought it must\r\nbe broken.\r\n\r\nBut, by an agonized effort that made the sweat start from his brow, he\r\nmanaged at last to move it, ever so slowly and painfully, drawing it by\r\ndegrees from under his prostrate body, until that much of him at least\r\nwas free.\r\n\r\nThe blood surged back into the numbed arm, causing the boy unspeakable\r\nagony. But as circulation was resumed, feeling and power came back, and\r\nBomba flexed and unflexed his fingers with a sensation of renewed life.\r\n\r\nHe was a helpless thing no longer. His right hand was clear. If he\r\ncould reach the machete, drag it free and hack his way through the\r\nimprisoning branches!\r\n\r\nBut even as he groped for the machete Bomba discovered something that\r\nseemed to turn the blood in his veins to ice.\r\n\r\nThe water was rising in the pool!\r\n\r\nUntil now, this phase of his terrible danger had not struck Bomba. The\r\npainful freeing of his right hand, the fear that in the fall he might\r\nhave sustained an injury that would cripple him and leave him a prey to\r\nthe first beast of the jungle that might roam that way, the dread that\r\nhe might never be able to free himself from those ruthless, imprisoning\r\nbranches had blinded him to another and more imminent peril that\r\nthreatened.\r\n\r\nThe rain was still torrential, and the pool that had been for weeks\r\nonly a muddy depression in the jungle floor was now filling with water.\r\n\r\nIf he could not reach his machete with his still half-numbed right hand\r\nand hack his way free from the branches before the water rose to his\r\nmouth and nose as he lay on his back, Bomba would die--drown like a rat\r\nin a trap.\r\n\r\nThis certainty roused him at once to frantic effort. By a desperate\r\nstrain, his hand found its way to the machete in his belt. The\r\nsharp-pointed twigs of the branch that imprisoned his chest tore at his\r\nflesh cruelly, but Bomba did not even feel the pain.\r\n\r\nIt was one thing to die on his feet, fighting to the last breath, and\r\nanother to lie there flat on his back, while the water crept up and up,\r\nseeking to close his nostrils, fill his throat, and deprive him of life.\r\n\r\nHe had the machete now, and was hacking feebly at the nearest branch,\r\nfor the strength had not yet come back into his hand and arm. He\r\nsucceeded in cutting away some of it. The fragments brushed aside fell\r\nwith a sickening splash into the water.\r\n\r\nSlow work! Heart-breaking work! If only the rain would stop, the\r\ntorrential downpour slacken for a while, he might yet get free. But in\r\nthe lowering heavens to which Bomba lifted his anguished eyes there was\r\nno hope. It would need but a short time to fill the pool to overflowing.\r\n\r\nThe water crept higher, while Bomba slashed furiously at the confining\r\nbranches. Steadily, sections of them came away and dropped into the\r\nmuddy water--but not fast enough!\r\n\r\nThe chill of the rising waters was about his shoulders now. When his\r\nneck tired of holding his head above the surface, he could feel the\r\nclammy touch upon his ear.\r\n\r\nHe had cleared away much of that network of branches. The weight on his\r\nchest was lighter. He could breathe more freely.\r\n\r\nHe tried to lift himself, but could not. That dreadful incubus still\r\nheld him securely.\r\n\r\nChilled to the bone, shivering, he went to work again. More branches\r\nand still more were pushed aside and dropped into the pool. The lapping\r\nof the water sounded in his ears as though death were crooning its\r\nawful lullaby.\r\n\r\nWearied of holding up his head, his arm one agonizing ache from the\r\neffort of using it in that strained position, Bomba let himself relax\r\nfor a moment and lay back gasping for breath.\r\n\r\nLying there, the water was over his ears, filling them with a drumming\r\nsound. It climbed still higher, as steady and implacable as fate.\r\n\r\nHe could not relax like that again without bringing the water over his\r\neyes, over his nose----\r\n\r\nBomba lifted his head frantically, and, summoning his last reserve of\r\nstrength, hacked at the boughs.\r\n\r\nHe would not die like that! He would not! Surely strength would be\r\ngiven him to resist that awful fate!\r\n\r\nAnd strength was given him--the temporary strength of a madman.\r\n\r\nHe knew no fatigue, felt no pain, was conscious of nothing but the\r\nsound and touch of that lapping, creeping water.\r\n\r\nThat spasm of superhuman energy was not without result. It seemed to\r\nhim that the load on his chest was lightening. Perhaps he could sit up.\r\n\r\nOne straining, frantic effort--another-- He fell back, weak and\r\ngasping, into the pool.\r\n\r\nThe waters closed over him with a greedy, sucking sound and blotted out\r\nhis face completely.\r\n\r\nA trail of tiny bubbles rose to the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nFEROCIOUS FOES\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Death had not yet claimed Bomba for his own.\r\n\r\nThe water broke and the lad’s face appeared, ghastly drawn and white.\r\nHe was not yet conquered. He would make one more supreme effort.\r\n\r\nHe drew the blessed air into his lungs. The veins stood out on his\r\nneck, the great muscles in his shoulders were ridged like whipcords\r\nas he strained to throw the last of the imprisoning branches from his\r\nchest.\r\n\r\nIf it had not been for his awful desperation, even his great strength\r\nwould not have been equal to the task. As it was, there was a ripping,\r\ntearing sound, and slowly the grip of the branches relaxed, slowly\r\nBomba forced himself upward, his face suffused with blood, his breath\r\ncoming in short gasps of agony.\r\n\r\nThen a great joy flooded his heart. The mass upon his chest yielded.\r\nHe sat upright in the pool. Now he could use his shoulders as well as\r\nhis arms to free the lower part of his body. And he had escaped those\r\ngreedy waters that a moment before had been sucking at his breath.\r\n\r\nHe rested for a while, for the effort had exhausted him; rested, while\r\nhe drew great draughts of air into his lungs, luxuriously expanding the\r\nchest that had been so cruelly imprisoned.\r\n\r\nHe flexed his arms and felt his body carefully to make sure no bones\r\nwere broken.\r\n\r\nEverything all right there! But his legs were yet held captive, and\r\nthere was no feeling in them. They might be broken, crushed. He could\r\nnot tell.\r\n\r\nHe could work faster now, for the strength of his back and shoulders\r\nwent into the quick, sharp strokes of the machete. One by one the\r\nboughs yielded to his vigorous attacks and were thrown aside.\r\n\r\nThe water was still creeping upward in the pool, but it would be a\r\nlong time now before it could reach the danger point. The rain was\r\nslackening too.\r\n\r\nStealing a precious moment to glance upward at the sky, Bomba saw\r\nthat the clouds were breaking and the sun beginning faintly to shine\r\nthrough. The wind had sunk to a gentle murmuring, and the last\r\nrumblings of the thunder were dying away in the distance.\r\n\r\nNow a foot and leg were free. With more heart, Bomba worked at the\r\nother, and soon cleared away the last of the branches.\r\n\r\nHe could see more clearly now what had happened to him. A great tree,\r\ntorn loose by that last cyclonic burst of wind, had fallen, sweeping\r\nhim along with its branches and imprisoning him in the pool.\r\n\r\nLucky for him, thought Bomba, that the boughs had caught him instead\r\nof the trunk. In the latter case, there would have been no escape. His\r\nlife would have paid toll to the storm.\r\n\r\nHe felt of his legs, raising them tentatively and working them till the\r\nblood flowed back in their veins again. To his joy, he established the\r\nfact that no bones were broken, though ligaments and muscles had been\r\ncruelly strained.\r\n\r\nTrying to drag himself to his feet, Bomba found that he could not bear\r\nhis weight upon them, and was forced at last to drag himself on hands\r\nand knees out of the pool and onto higher ground.\r\n\r\nThe jungle was friendly again. Far above, the sun streamed out through\r\nbroken clouds. Monkeys chattered, parrots screamed, and the timid small\r\ncreatures once more ventured out from their hiding places.\r\n\r\nIn Bomba’s heart was a great thankfulness for his escape. Yet at the\r\nsame time he bemoaned the hurt to his legs, since he could not hasten\r\nas quickly as he had hoped to the rescue of Casson, Pipina and little\r\nPirah.\r\n\r\nHe dragged himself to his feet, slowly and painfully, resting half his\r\nweight against the trunk of a tree. He looked down at his legs and\r\nfound they were torn and bleeding in a dozen places from contact with\r\nthe thorny twigs. The rest of his body was badly bruised and cut. He\r\nwould rub himself with river mud, his sovereign remedy, as soon as he\r\ncould walk.\r\n\r\nIt took some time for the strength to return to his bruised limbs. And\r\neven when he could move and bear his weight upon them, his gait was no\r\nmore than an uncertain wobble.\r\n\r\nHe was furiously impatient of this infirmity. In this condition he was\r\nas helpless as a wounded tapir. How easily he could become the prey of\r\nany beast of the jungle that might happen to come across him!\r\n\r\nBomba shifted his machete from his right hand to the left and felt for\r\nhis bow and arrows. They were gone, torn from him, probably, as the\r\ntree fell upon him.\r\n\r\nThis was a serious loss, and his heart was filled with consternation.\r\nHe made a careful search of the vicinity, but could find no trace of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was another illustration of the saying that misfortunes never come\r\nsingly. First he had been robbed of his revolver. Now he had lost his\r\nbow and arrows. Only his machete was left to meet the manifold dangers\r\nby which he was surrounded and for use against the wily Nascanora and\r\nhis braves. He wondered grimly how long even his machete would be left\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nBut he had to make the best of it. Perhaps he would meet some friendly\r\nnatives who would trade him a bow and some arrows for the meat of the\r\npeccary. If not, he would have to shape the weapons himself with his\r\nknife, if he could find suitable material.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he had returned to the pool. There, scooping up great\r\nhandfuls of mud, he rubbed it over his torn and bleeding flesh. Then,\r\nimpatient of further delay, he started off through the jungle in the\r\ndirection of the Giant Cataract.\r\n\r\nHe realized at last that he was very hungry, and, thinking that his\r\nweakness was partly due to this, he took from his pouch some of the\r\nroasted meat and ate with a relish.\r\n\r\nHe felt refreshed after this, and proceeded at a much better pace. His\r\nlimbs still pained him greatly, and he was forced to stop at frequent\r\nintervals to rest. But he was getting stronger, and his confidence was\r\nreturning to him.\r\n\r\nHis chief concern was the loss of his weapons. At any moment he might\r\nbe called upon to use them in defence. His knife, to be sure, was a\r\nterrible weapon at close quarters. Even at some distance he could hurl\r\nit with great precision, as he had on the night when he had sent it\r\nwhizzing through the air and buried it in the throat of the jaguar that\r\nwas leaping at the white rubber hunters.\r\n\r\nBut he saved that as a last resort. His main dependence had been the\r\nbow and arrows, that might enable him to make a stand even if attacked\r\nby several enemies at the same time.\r\n\r\nThey were essential, too, in hunting game for food. But that thought\r\njust now gave him little concern. He could always find jaboty eggs\r\nin the jungle or catch fish in any stream he might encounter. And at\r\npresent he was well supplied with dried meat.\r\n\r\nIf he had been superstitious, he might have thought that a malign fate\r\nhad been following him ever since he set out on his journey. There was\r\nthe loss of his revolver and harmonica, the enforced return to the hut\r\nwhen Hondura’s braves had come upon him, the further loss of his bow\r\nand arrows, his submergence in the pool when the tree had trapped him.\r\n\r\nA native would have interpreted these things as evidence that the gods\r\nfrowned on his undertaking, and would have turned back. But they only\r\nincreased Bomba’s determination to play the game out to the end. He\r\nthrived on opposition. What were obstacles for but to be surmounted?\r\n\r\nHe traveled on for perhaps an hour. Then he came to a clearing among\r\nthe dense underbrush. He welcomed this as enabling him to make more\r\nrapid progress.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he stepped back, startled. There before him, grazing placidly\r\nbeneath the heat of the tropical sun, was a great drove of peccaries,\r\nthe fierce wild pigs of the jungle.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, Bomba would have been able to circle that grazing drove so\r\nsilently and swiftly that before they had caught the scent of human\r\npresence he would have been far beyond their reach.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the most intense desire in Bomba’s mind at that moment!\r\nHe had seen natives after the peccaries had finished with them, and\r\nshuddered at the sight. If they should get at him in the open, his life\r\nwould not be worth a moment’s purchase. This would be true even if he\r\nhad his weapons. How much more certain would be his fate under present\r\nconditions!\r\n\r\nBut Bomba now had not as full control of his limbs as usual, and he\r\nmade a slight noise as he stepped back into the forest fringe.\r\n\r\nThe peccary nearest him lifted up its wicked, blunt-nosed head and\r\nsniffed the air. Then, with a snort of rage, it turned in the direction\r\nof the sound and started straight toward Bomba. The rest of the drove\r\nautomatically followed their leader.\r\n\r\nThere was only one thing to be done. Quick as thought, Bomba leaped\r\nfor the limb of the tree nearest him, swinging his body clear of the\r\nground just as the first peccary reached the spot where he had been.\r\nThe others followed with such headlong speed that many of them struck\r\nagainst the trunk of the tree and shook it with their impact.\r\n\r\nNot a second too soon, thought Bomba, as he swung himself from branch\r\nto branch until he reached a fork, where he ensconced himself.\r\n\r\nBelow him at the base of the tree the peccaries were acting like things\r\ndemented. They ran around and around in circles, snorting viciously and\r\nstumbling over one another in their fury.\r\n\r\nBomba was thankful that pigs were not like monkeys or jaguars, who were\r\nas much at home among the branches of a tree as they were on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe peccaries could not climb, and so were powerless to vent their rage\r\non Bomba. He was safe for the present and could smile grimly as they\r\ngnashed their tusks, those terrible tusks that were like so many knives\r\nand which could so easily slash him to bits.\r\n\r\nThe boy was filled with resentment against these ferocious creatures.\r\nThey could not harm him, but they were delaying him in his pursuit of\r\nNascanora. For all he knew, they might keep him treed for days. And in\r\nthe meantime what might be happening to the captives? His heart was\r\nwrung with anguish at the thought.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed--another. Then the fury of the peccaries began to abate.\r\nThey were short-sighted, and used to holding their heads down as no\r\nlonger gazing at their enemy, they soon forgot they grazed. It tired\r\nthem to look up. And, his existence. With the stupid peccary, out of\r\nsight was out of mind.\r\n\r\nThey began to drift away at last, moving aimlessly as though they had\r\nforgotten all about Bomba and the reason for their ferocious attack.\r\n\r\nBut Bomba’s forced rest had brought renewed strength to his limbs, and\r\nhe felt more like his own strong, active self.\r\n\r\nStill the lad did not dare start his descent until all of them had\r\nvanished from sight. Then, slowly and cautiously, making as little\r\nnoise as possible, he slipped downward through the heavy branches.\r\n\r\nHe had reached the lowest bough when something bade him pause.\r\n\r\nSomething was watching him from the jungle, something that he could not\r\nsee but could feel!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE JAGUARS ATTACK\r\n\r\n\r\nBomba became suddenly motionless, flattened against the tree as though\r\nhe were a part of it.\r\n\r\nHe did not dare move even to go upward again, for fear that the hidden\r\nenemy would be tempted to come forth from its hiding place.\r\n\r\nBomba had not lived all his life in close contact with the beasts of\r\nthe jungle for nothing. His sense of smell was almost as well developed\r\nas theirs.\r\n\r\nNow this useful sense told him that his enemy was none other than the\r\nbig jungle cat, the jaguar, the most dreaded four-footed denizen of the\r\njungle.\r\n\r\nAnd there might be more than one of these ferocious beasts. He knew\r\nthat they frequently traveled in pairs. His flesh crawled as the full\r\nhelplessness of his position came over him.\r\n\r\nThere he was without bow or arrow or revolver--his only weapon the\r\nmachete. His position in the tree rendered him all the more helpless\r\nagainst the attack of the big cats, for they could climb more swiftly\r\nthan could he.\r\n\r\nWhat to do? Where to turn?\r\n\r\nThere was a stealthy rustling in the bushes, but as yet Bomba could\r\nsee nothing. His fingers itched for the comforting feel of his bow and\r\narrow. He almost groaned aloud when he thought of his lost revolver,\r\nthe cherished “fire stick,” that at such close quarters could do deadly\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nThe faint rustling drew closer and closer. From the corner of his eye\r\nBomba glimpsed a gleaming yellowish-brown body. Beyond this he could\r\nsee the dim outline of another.\r\n\r\nTwo of them! And what chance would he have even against one?\r\n\r\nSensing his helplessness, the jaguars were gaining confidence. He could\r\nsee their eyes now, glowing like sparks of fire. In a moment they would\r\nabandon cover altogether and begin to climb the tree.\r\n\r\nBomba could no longer disguise his presence. The beasts knew that he\r\nwas there.\r\n\r\nSo the boy began suddenly to swarm up through the branches. If he could\r\ncrawl out upon a slender bough, so slight that it would barely hold\r\nhis weight, there was a possibility that the jaguars would not dare to\r\nventure after him.\r\n\r\nIt was a frail hope, for Bomba knew that when the jaguar’s blood was\r\nup he was relentless in pursuit of his prey.\r\n\r\nStill, Bomba hoped against hope that he at least might find a better\r\nposition from which to use his machete. At any rate, it was his only\r\nchance. So he went higher, and higher, his eyes searching for a\r\nstrategic position.\r\n\r\nHis movement stirred his enemies to action. They broke from cover as he\r\nbegan to swing himself upward. A quick glance downward showed Bomba the\r\nswift advance of the lean, hungry brutes. It would be a race between\r\nthem to see which would grasp him first.\r\n\r\nBomba climbed like a monkey, his knife between his teeth. His progress\r\nwas lightning swift, fear lending him added celerity. Below him he\r\ncould hear the rustling of leaves, the crackling of small branches, as\r\nthe foremost jaguar followed him.\r\n\r\nA slender bough stretched before him. Out on this Bomba crept, feeling\r\nit sag beneath his weight and not knowing but at any moment it might\r\nbreak and send him to the ground.\r\n\r\nA vicious growl behind him caused Bomba to turn suddenly on his frail\r\nperch, nearly losing his balance as he did so. His eyes searched wildly\r\nfor the lithe form of his enemy among the leaves and branches.\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to discover the beast at first, for at the lad’s\r\nmovement it had flattened itself against the trunk of the tree, wicked,\r\nglittering eyes alone awake and watchful.\r\n\r\nBut in a moment Bomba made out the sinuous figure just below the bough\r\non which he had taken refuge; caught the glare of those malignant eyes\r\nfull upon him.\r\n\r\nWinding his limbs about the bending bough and gripping it powerfully\r\nwith his left hand, Bomba drew the machete from his teeth and waited.\r\n\r\nBelow he could hear the second jaguar climbing swiftly, breaking off\r\nthe smaller branches as it came, all stealth having been abandoned in\r\nits eagerness to share in the kill.\r\n\r\nThe branch on which Bomba sat bent suddenly and gave forth an ominous,\r\ncrackling sound. The first jaguar had moved upward and had put out a\r\ntentative paw to test the strength of the branch.\r\n\r\nBomba’s heart pounded as though it would force its way through his\r\nribs. In a few moments now he would know whether he was to live or die.\r\nAnd with those relentless man-eaters on his track, the odds were all in\r\nfavor of death. Even if he were able to beat off one of the beasts, the\r\nother would be on him at once and avenge its mate.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of the nearer brute told it that the bough on which Bomba\r\nrested would not support the weight of two bodies. So it chose a\r\nheavier one just below that on which the boy was perched, and began to\r\ncreep out upon it, tail switching and jaws dripping greedily.\r\n\r\nBomba watched its progress with the same sense of helplessness he had\r\nsometimes felt in nightmares. Death was separated from him only by\r\nfeet. A few moments more and the feet would be reduced to inches.\r\n\r\nOh, for his bow and arrows! Oh, for the “fire stick” that would have\r\nso quickly turned the tables on his foe! They would have given him at\r\nleast a chance for life. Now his chance was not one in a hundred.\r\n\r\nThe jaguar crept out still farther upon its branch, ears flattened back\r\nagainst its head, cruel teeth showing in a snarl of fury.\r\n\r\nBomba’s fingers tensed about the handle of the machete and he shouted,\r\nhoping to disconcert the animal and perhaps make it lose its balance.\r\n\r\nBut this availed nothing. At the sound of Bomba’s voice the great beast\r\ngave a snarl of rage and lifted its huge paw, armed with terrible claws\r\nthat could strip the flesh from the lad’s body.\r\n\r\nBomba met the vicious stroke halfway with a slash of his machete. The\r\njaguar howled with rage and pain. The cut maddened it. With a ferocious\r\ngrowl it crouched to spring.\r\n\r\nIt was then that what seemed a miracle happened!\r\n\r\nBomba, in whose heart despair had entered and who thought that this\r\nwas his last moment on earth, saw the body of the ferocious beast\r\nleap suddenly into the air, grasp wildly at anything that promised a\r\nfoothold, and then plunge downward through the branches to the ground.\r\n\r\n“Help has come!” thought Bomba, scarcely able to believe his eyes and\r\nalmost dropping the dripping machete from his hand in the agitation\r\nthat possessed him. But from where and from whom?\r\n\r\nHe heard expressions of jubilation, and two dark-skinned men appeared\r\nbeneath the tree.\r\n\r\nThey were bending over the lifeless cat that had been pierced through\r\nwith an arrow, when a rustling among the branches and a low growl\r\nwarned Bomba that the second jaguar had turned its attention to its new\r\nfoes and was about to attack.\r\n\r\nHe could see the brute crouched among the branches, ready to spring\r\nupon the two men at the foot of the tree.\r\n\r\n“Back! Back into the jungle!” he shouted.\r\n\r\nThe men had barely time to jump back before the jaguar sprang.\r\n\r\nThe great vicious ball of fur struck the ground with a thud, not ten\r\nfeet away from Bomba’s rescuers, and crouched to spring.\r\n\r\nBut before it could launch itself into the air two bows twanged.\r\nOne shot missed, but the second arrow caught the beast full in one\r\ngleaming, murderous eye and pierced to the brain.\r\n\r\nThe brute gave a few convulsive struggles and then straightened out\r\nbeside its mate.\r\n\r\nThe situation had changed with the quickness of a kaleidoscope. The\r\nwould-be killers had themselves been killed just at the moment that\r\ntheir victory had seemed assured.\r\n\r\nBut by whom had their death been brought about? Were these newcomers\r\nfriendly or hostile to Bomba? The thought came to the boy that they\r\nmight be of the party of headhunters. If so, he might have escaped\r\ndeath in one form to meet it in another even more terrible.\r\n\r\nBut as he hesitated, he heard their voices more clearly and recognized\r\nthem. Then he waited no longer.\r\n\r\nHe slid hurriedly to the ground and came face to face with Ashati and\r\nNeram, the former slaves of Jojasta, the medicine man of the Moving\r\nMountain!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE MAD MONKEY\r\n\r\n\r\nAshati and Neram dropped to their knees before Bomba, clasping his\r\nhands and bowing their black heads before him. Neram, bending lower,\r\ntook one of Bomba’s sandaled feet and placed it on his neck as a sign\r\nthat he was slave and Bomba master.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the lonely boy swelled at this sign of gratitude and\r\naffection. He stooped and raised the kneeling men, and made them stand\r\non their feet before him.\r\n\r\n“You have saved Bomba’s life,” he said with deep feeling. “If you had\r\nnot come when you did the jaguars would have killed him. Bomba will not\r\nforget.”\r\n\r\n“Ashati and Neram would have been nothing now but bones buried in\r\nthe heart of the Moving Mountain if you had not come to their help,”\r\nreplied Ashati, who seemed to be the spokesman for the two. “You saved\r\nthem from death, and freed them from the cruel yoke of Jojasta, the\r\nmedicine man. Ashati and Neram have no master but Bomba, and will go\r\nanywhere in the jungle at the side of Bomba as his slave. Their lives\r\nbelong to Bomba.”\r\n\r\n“You shall go with me wherever I go,” replied Bomba. “But you shall go\r\nas my friends and not as my slaves. Bomba has nothing to offer you but\r\nfriendship. If you will take that and go with him, he will be glad.”\r\n\r\nSo it was settled, and with many more expressions of gratitude and\r\ndevotion on the part of the ex-slaves of Jojasta, Bomba and the two\r\nmen set to work to skin and quarter one of the dead jaguars that had\r\nunwittingly furnished them a feast.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in this and the building of a fire for the roasting of\r\nthe best portions of the meat, Ashati and Neram imparted to Bomba news\r\nthat he was anxious to hear.\r\n\r\nIn their wanderings they had noted the bands of Nascanora and his\r\nhalf-brother, Tocarora, heading in the direction of the Giant Cataract.\r\nThis had been only two days before and not far from the place where\r\nthey were now standing. From their hiding place in the brush, the\r\nslaves had seen that each party had with it a number of captives.\r\n\r\n“Was there a white man among them?” asked Bomba eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Ashati; “an old man, very thin and with white hair.”\r\n\r\nBomba’s heart leaped. Casson then was still alive! He had not succumbed\r\nto the hardships of the journey.\r\n\r\n“Can you take Bomba to the place where you saw them and point out to\r\nhim the way they were going?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Ashati. “But they must be a long way from there now, for\r\nthey were going fast. And they kept looking behind them as though they\r\nthought men were coming after them.”\r\n\r\nThe news set Bomba on fire with impatience to be off. Under his urging\r\nand example, the roasting of the meat was swiftly completed. He divided\r\nthe food equally between the three of them. Whatever might happen to\r\nthem in the future, it was certain that they would not starve.\r\n\r\nAfter they had got fairly started, with Ashati as guide, toward the\r\nspot where the path of the slaves had crossed that of the savages,\r\nBomba narrated to his companions some of his experiences since he had\r\nleft the hut of Pipina.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the part that concerned the loss of his bow and arrows,\r\nAshati insisted that the boy should take his and that he, Ashati, could\r\ndo very well with his hunting knife. Besides, he would make another set\r\nof weapons at their first resting place.\r\n\r\nBomba would have refused, but seeing that he could not do so without\r\nhurting the feelings of the devoted fellow, at last accepted the gift.\r\n\r\n“It was an arrow from that bow that found the heart of the jaguar that\r\nwould have sunk its claws in your flesh and ripped it from the bones,”\r\nsaid Ashati, as he handed it over.\r\n\r\n“Bomba has not asked you yet how it was you came just in time to save\r\nhis life,” said the lad.\r\n\r\n“We hunted Bomba day and night,” Ashati replied. “Our lives were yours,\r\nfor you had saved them. We came on your trail in the jungle, and\r\nfollowed after. Ashati saw you in the tree as the jaguar lifted its paw\r\nto strike. Then Ashati prayed to the Spirit of the Jungle and shot his\r\narrow. The Spirit made it go straight, and the jaguar died.”\r\n\r\nIt was now late afternoon, and Bomba and his followers had not traveled\r\nfar before the swift tropic night descended on them and forced them to\r\nrest for the night.\r\n\r\nBomba chafed at the necessity, though he himself was almost exhausted\r\nin mind and body by the stirring events of the day that had taxed both\r\nto the utmost.\r\n\r\nHe was up with the dawn, however, and, rousing Ashati and Neram,\r\nsummoned them to share his hasty breakfast and start on the day’s\r\njourney. They obeyed with willingness, though no more than half awake.\r\nTheir bodies wasted and their strength sapped by years of deprivation\r\nand torments at the hands of Jojasta could not throw off the fatigue\r\nas readily as the healthy jungle lad, whose veins were pulsing with\r\nvitality.\r\n\r\nBut Bomba’s quest of Nascanora could not wait. Delay, however slight,\r\nmight result in the death of his friends, if indeed they still lived.\r\nIf Ashati and Neram could travel at Bomba’s pace, he would be glad to\r\nhave them with him, for they were companions in his loneliness and\r\nallies in case of danger.\r\n\r\nBut if they could not keep up with him, he would have to go on ahead,\r\nleaving them to join him when they could.\r\n\r\nBut once roused, they seemed as eager as himself to continue the\r\njourney. Even the prospect of an encounter with Nascanora and his\r\nbraves did not deter them, as long as they were under Bomba’s\r\nleadership. What they had already seen of him had led them to attribute\r\nto him almost magical power. Their anxiety to please and serve the lad\r\nin every way they could deeply touched Bomba, in whose life loyalty and\r\nservice of any kind had been so sadly lacking.\r\n\r\nThey stamped out the embers of the fire they had built to keep off the\r\njungle beasts during the night, ate of their supply of jaguar meat,\r\nand struck onward through the forest in the direction of the Giant\r\nCataract.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose higher, and with full daylight came a fresh burst of speed\r\non the part of Bomba. If Ashati and Neram found it hard to keep up with\r\nhim, they did not murmur. They would have suffered any hardship rather\r\nthan be left behind by him whom they had chosen as their master.\r\n\r\nThey traveled all day without meeting with any unusual adventure,\r\npausing only briefly at noon to roast some jaboty eggs they found in\r\nthe forest that gave a welcome variation to their meat diet.\r\n\r\nThe shadows were beginning to gather when they came at last to the spot\r\nwhere the paths of the slaves and the two parties of headhunters had\r\ncrossed.\r\n\r\nThe trail of the Indians was cold, but it was not difficult for one so\r\nversed in woodcraft as Bomba to pick it up. There was still a little\r\ndaylight remaining, and he persisted in utilizing every moment of it to\r\ngain another mile or two before he called a halt for the night.\r\n\r\nOn and on they went, although by this time they were nearly stumbling\r\nwith fatigue. They were penetrating a part of the jungle that was new\r\nto Bomba. Pools, swelled by the recent rain, were frequent, some of\r\nthem so deep that it was necessary to cross them by notched trunks of\r\ntrees, the crude bridges of the jungle.\r\n\r\nCrossing one of these, Ashati, wearied almost to fainting, stumbled\r\nand would have fallen had not Bomba seized him and dragged him to the\r\nsafety of the further bank.\r\n\r\nThey had gone but a few yards farther, Bomba’s eyes straining to detect\r\nthe faintly marked trail, when there was a thud, and on the ground\r\nbefore them, directly in their path, appeared a figure so grotesque in\r\nform and ugly in face that Bomba took a startled step backward and the\r\ntwo slaves fell to the ground in a fit of shuddering terror.\r\n\r\n“The mad monkey!” chattered Neram, and then, as the creature advanced\r\non them, uttered an ear-piercing shriek.\r\n\r\nGibbering and mouthing ferociously, froth slavering from its jaws, the\r\nhuge ape sprang toward Bomba and the cowering slaves.\r\n\r\nBomba was paralyzed at first by the hideous appearance of the beast and\r\ninfected to some degree with the superstitious terror that animated\r\nAshati and Neram. He seemed bereft of the power of movement.\r\n\r\nThen gathering together his forces, he sprang backward swiftly and\r\nfitted an arrow to his bow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nBESET BY ENEMIES\r\n\r\n\r\nEven as Bomba drew his arrow to its head he found that he felt a\r\nstrange unwillingness to inflict injury on this antagonist.\r\n\r\nThe monkeys were his friends. Often they had helped him when other\r\nfoes, much more like Bomba in form and appearance, had sought to take\r\nhis life. He could not forget how the swarm of monkeys had turned the\r\ntide of battle in his fight with Nascanora and his braves when they had\r\nattacked the cabin.\r\n\r\nSo Bomba called to this slavering, hideous object in the language of\r\nthe monkeys, trying to show that he was not an enemy.\r\n\r\nBut if anything, the aspect of the ape became still more fierce and\r\nthreatening. It uttered a shrill cry and sprang at the lad with hairy\r\narms outstretched to grasp him.\r\n\r\nAshati and Neram gave a shout of warning, and seeing that their young\r\nleader was in grave danger, conquered their fear and sprang to his\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nThe bow of the jungle boy sang with a twanging sound as the arrow sped\r\nfrom it. But the attack of the monkey was so swift that the arrow,\r\ninstead of entering the heart as Bomba had intended, pierced the flank\r\nof the brute.\r\n\r\nWith a howl of pain and rage, the great ape plucked out the arrow, and\r\nswung around upon Bomba with the bloody point of the weapon upraised.\r\n\r\nBut Bomba was quicker than the ape. He sprang aside and, drawing his\r\nmachete from his belt, struck the animal’s arm a blow that cut deep and\r\ncaused the blood to spurt into the distorted face of his assailant.\r\n\r\nThe arrow dropped clattering to the ground, and with a weird and\r\nterrible howl the ape swung itself with its uninjured arm into the\r\nbranches of a tree and vanished into the depths of the jungle.\r\n\r\nTrembling, Ashati and Neram faced Bomba in that uncanny twilight. For a\r\nwhile they said nothing, but stood staring solemnly at each other.\r\n\r\nIt was Bomba who first broke the silence, and in the deep stillness of\r\nthe shadow-filled jungle his voice sounded hollow in his own ears.\r\n\r\n“The mad monkey! If he is alone, all will be well. But if there are\r\nothers----”\r\n\r\n“There are others,” interrupted Ashati. “One mad monkey needs but bite\r\nanother, and that one too will become mad. It is in that way the evil\r\nspirits get possession of a flock of monkeys and set loose a thousand\r\ndemons upon the jungle.”\r\n\r\n“And the bite of one sets loose an evil spirit within ourselves, and we\r\nbecome even as the mad monkeys,” said Neram, his teeth chattering.\r\n\r\nBomba knew that he spoke truly. A kind of hydrophobia would sometimes\r\nbe communicated by a snake-bitten monkey to its mates, and by them to\r\nany human being that came within their reach while the epidemic was\r\nraging. He had known of whole flocks of monkeys having been decimated\r\nbefore the terrible disease had run its course. And at such times there\r\nwas no inhabitant of the jungle to be so much feared as a mad monkey.\r\n\r\n“We cannot stay here,” said Bomba, looking about him. “We must go on.\r\nPerhaps we shall find shelter, a cave or an abandoned hut of a caboclo,\r\nwhere we can spend the night and leave this terrible place with the\r\ndaylight.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, we must go on,” agreed Ashati, and Neram nodded his head in\r\nagreement. “To stay here would be to bring that hurt monkey back for\r\nhis revenge.”\r\n\r\n“With good fortune we may escape the notice of others of the flock,\r\nsince it is night and they may sleep,” suggested Neram.\r\n\r\n“Then we must make no more noise than the foot of the jaguar,” warned\r\nBomba, and, turning, he sped silently and swiftly from the place,\r\nfollowed closely by his companions.\r\n\r\nThey had proceeded only a short distance when a horrible chattering\r\noverhead caused them to look up, and in the branches of a tree they saw\r\ntwo big apes gibbering and grinning at them, with the same awful look\r\nin their eyes that had marked the first one they had encountered.\r\n\r\nAs the little party moved swiftly on, a large castanha nut struck\r\nAshati on the shoulder with such force that he was felled to the ground.\r\n\r\nBomba lifted him to his feet and hurried him onward just as a\r\nbombardment of the heavy missiles came pelting down. A hideous wailing\r\nand a sharp, crackling sound like a crazy laugh followed the three\r\nfugitives as they raced onward.\r\n\r\nBy this time, superstitious terror had taken complete possession of\r\nAshati and Neram, and Bomba himself could feel the hair rising on his\r\nhead. The swift-falling darkness, the knowledge that danger was all\r\nabout them, that insane enemies were skulking perhaps behind a tree,\r\nleering at them from branches overhead, crouching in ambush behind a\r\nconcealing bush or shrub, at any moment to reach out a hairy arm--all\r\nthese things combined to fill them with terror.\r\n\r\nTheir flight was unreasoning. They plunged through thorn bushes that\r\ntore at their flesh, and felt no pain. They stumbled and fell into\r\nblack ooze that might hold writhing snakes, and scarcely thought of\r\nit. To put distance between themselves and this nightmare became their\r\nonly aim.\r\n\r\nOnce a terrible figure dropped upon the neck of Ashati from the\r\nbranches above. The native gave a dreadful shriek and threw himself\r\nupon his face.\r\n\r\nThe mad beast catapulted from the shoulders of Ashati and fell at the\r\nfeet of Bomba. It was the work of a moment for the lad to sink his\r\nmachete to the handle into the hairy body. The thing crouched as though\r\nto spring, then gave a ghastly screech and sprawled upon the ground.\r\n\r\n“He is dead?” asked Neram, coming forward, unbelieving.\r\n\r\nAt the words, the prostrate Ashati raised himself on hands and knees\r\nand crawled over to where the lifeless brute was lying.\r\n\r\n“Dead!” he gasped, and dragging himself to his feet stared hard at\r\nBomba.\r\n\r\nFor it was a superstition among the natives that a mad creature was\r\npossessed of an evil spirit that made it immune to death. The fact then\r\nthat Bomba had killed one of the mad monkeys so easily filled them with\r\nsurprise and hope. If he had killed one, he might kill many. Their\r\nweapons were not as powerless as they had feared.\r\n\r\nBut their relief was swiftly changed to fear by a strange, weird\r\nrustling among the trees that swelled in volume as they listened, as\r\nthough a great storm had entered the jungle and was sweeping all\r\nbefore it. But there was no storm nor sign of one.\r\n\r\n“The mad monkeys!” whispered Bomba. “They have told each other that we\r\nare here. They know that we are few and they are many. Come!”\r\n\r\nIf their flight had betrayed panic earlier, it was nothing to the fear\r\nthat now gave wings to their feet. They might hold their own against a\r\nfew. They could not face an army, such as, from the sounds, now seemed\r\nto be in pursuit of them.\r\n\r\nBut even then Bomba had no hate against his pursuers, such as he felt\r\ntoward jaguars and snakes. He pitied them as the suffering victims of a\r\nterrible disorder. None the less, he knew that they were bent on taking\r\nhis life and that if it came to a combat it was a case of kill or be\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nThere was but one hope, and that a slender one; the hope that they\r\nmight find some cave or other shelter in which they could barricade\r\nthemselves and hold the maddened animals at bay. He knew of no such\r\nplace in that vicinity, and even if he had, it would have been\r\ndifficult to find it in the dark.\r\n\r\nAshati and Neram, with what breath they had, were muttering prayers to\r\nthe Spirit of the Jungle. If ever help was needed, it was needed then.\r\n\r\nOnward they plunged through the black night of the jungle, that\r\nterrible rustling as of a mighty wind coming closer and closer with\r\nevery moment.\r\n\r\nAs the pursuing monkeys drew closer to their prey, they began to howl\r\nand jabber horribly. It seemed to Bomba that the whole jungle was one\r\nhideous jangle of sound.\r\n\r\nNeram screamed. A hairy arm had reached from a low-hanging branch,\r\nencircling his neck. He struck at it with his knife and stumbled after\r\nBomba and Ashati.\r\n\r\nThey were panting, spent. In another moment that awful swarm of\r\nmaddened beasts would descend upon them.\r\n\r\nStumbling blindly on, Bomba felt his foot slip into a hollow at the\r\nsame time that his body struck violently against a hard substance.\r\n\r\nHe stretched out his hands and felt rather than saw in the darkness\r\nthat he had come to the entrance of a cave.\r\n\r\n“Quick!” he gasped, stepping back and nearly falling over the cowering\r\nform of Neram. “Into the cave! Quick!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nLYING IN AMBUSH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two slaves seemed not to hear Bomba.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they were half dead from fright, or perhaps they thought that\r\nthe malady that had attacked the monkeys had disordered Bomba’s mind as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nDespite his command, they continued to crouch stupidly close to the\r\nground, striving to keep out of reach of the clutching hands that swung\r\nfrom the branches overhead.\r\n\r\nOne great ape dropped to the ground and came swiftly toward them on all\r\nfours, uttering howl after howl, so wild and eerie that it froze the\r\nblood in the veins of the adventurers.\r\n\r\nFinding that the slaves were too terrified to heed his orders, Bomba\r\nseized Neram, who was nearer to him, and flung him bodily through the\r\nopening of the cave. He took Ashati by the arm and dragged him forward,\r\nshouting:\r\n\r\n“The cave! The cave! Do you hear what I say? Get inside quick, and I\r\nwill follow.”\r\n\r\nFrom inside the cave Neram reached out a hand and drew Ashati within\r\nthe sheltering blackness.\r\n\r\nAs Bomba was about to follow, the monkeys, following the leadership of\r\nthe great ape that had begun the actual attack, dropped to the ground\r\nand swarmed toward Bomba.\r\n\r\nThe boy leaped for the gaping mouth of the cave just as the first of\r\nthe monkeys grazed his arm with its paw.\r\n\r\nNeram and Ashati dragged him further into the depths of the cavern,\r\nwhile, with a shriek of rage, the baffled monkey, seeking to follow,\r\ndashed instead into the rock surface at the side.\r\n\r\nBomba stubbed his foot, bruising it as he fell forward into the cave.\r\nHe stooped down to examine the object and found that it was a great\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n“Come, help me!” he cried to the two slaves, who were fully awake now\r\nto the fact that there was hope of escape.\r\n\r\nThey stooped to aid him, and as the monkeys recovered from their\r\nsurprise at the sudden disappearance of their enemies and began to\r\nsearch out the entrance to the cave, those within rolled the great\r\nstone to the entrance, fairly blocking it.\r\n\r\nWhile they held that stone in place they were safe.\r\n\r\nBomba and his companions sank down on the ground, gasping for breath,\r\nand pressed their weight against the rock.\r\n\r\nThe weird howling of the enraged monkeys outside their shelter made\r\nthem tremble even now, lest their cunning foes should find some other\r\nentrance to the cave and come pouring in to indulge in massacre.\r\n\r\nBut as time passed and they remained unmolested in their retreat, while\r\nthe awful howling of the monkeys died down to a mere jumble of sound,\r\nthey began to take courage and hope that all would still be well with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBomba had feared at first that the cave might be the lair of some wild\r\nbeast of the jungle.\r\n\r\nBut the fact that the stone was so near the mouth of the cave and was\r\nevidently intended to block up the entrance seemed to argue human\r\noccupation. Some native, perhaps, had become an outlaw from his tribe\r\nand had chosen the cave as his home.\r\n\r\nWhen it became certain that the monkeys had tired of their quest and\r\nwere straggling off again into the jungle, Bomba ventured to make a\r\ncautious tour of the cave to make sure that his guess had been correct.\r\n\r\nEven then he was afraid that at any moment his fingers might touch\r\nsomething warm and alive but not human.\r\n\r\nHowever, the cave was a small one, and he soon found, to his great\r\nrelief, that, save for Ashati, Neram and himself, it was unoccupied.\r\n\r\nTired beyond words, but jubilant at their escape, Bomba returned to the\r\ntwo, who still squatted on the ground close to the stone that guarded\r\nthe entrance to the cave.\r\n\r\nAshati was inclined to indulge in prophecy.\r\n\r\n“The Spirit of the Jungle is good,” he stated, as Bomba threw himself\r\ndown beside them. “Twice it has saved the life of Bomba. The captives\r\nof the wicked Nascanora and his half-brother Tocarora will be spared.\r\nBomba will live to seek out Sobrinini, and find from her the secret\r\nthat the poor old white man cannot tell. It is for that that the Spirit\r\nof the Jungle has twice saved the life of Bomba.”\r\n\r\n“Ahma,” said Neram, which meant “so be it,” as he bowed his head\r\nreverently.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before all three were asleep, stretched on the ground\r\nagainst the great rock, so that the slightest push on it would be\r\ncertain to rouse them.\r\n\r\nBut they were undisturbed all through the long hours of the night, and\r\nat dawn awoke, refreshed and ravenous for the great chunks of roasted\r\njaguar meat they had prepared the day before.\r\n\r\nThey ate quickly, listening meanwhile for any sounds from the jungle\r\nwhich might warn them of a further attack on the part of the mad\r\nmonkeys.\r\n\r\nBut, aside from the ordinary jungle noises, everything was as quiet as\r\nthey could wish. Unless they were still slyly watched by their enemies,\r\ntheir escape from the cave should be a matter of no great difficulty.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, both Neram and Ashati were reluctant to leave the\r\nfriendly shelter of the cave, and urged that Bomba rest there another\r\nday and night until all danger should be gone.\r\n\r\nBut Bomba would not listen to this.\r\n\r\n“You stay,” he said. “But Bomba must go. If, as you say, it was the\r\nSpirit of the Jungle that twice saved his life yesterday, the Spirit\r\nmight be angry if Bomba were afraid and perhaps the next time would not\r\nsave him from the hairy arm of the great ape or the sharp claws of the\r\njaguar. No, Bomba must go.”\r\n\r\nSo, seeing that he was in earnest and thinking that if the lad were\r\nunder the protection of the Spirit of the Jungle they would be also,\r\nNeram and Ashati said nothing more and helped Bomba roll the great\r\nstone from the entrance to the cave.\r\n\r\n“Where you go we will go,” said Ashati gently, as the welcome sunlight\r\nstreamed in. “Though you will not have us for your slaves, you are our\r\nmaster. Let Bomba start and we will follow.”\r\n\r\nMaking no sound, they went swiftly through the jungle and did not pause\r\nor stop to rest until they had put a great distance between them and\r\nthe scene of the fantastic nightmare adventure of the evening before.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun was high above their heads and all the jungle seemed to\r\nfry and crackle beneath the heat of it, Bomba and his companions sat\r\ndown to eat the last of the jaguar meat and some berries and nuts they\r\nhad gathered by the way. Farther back they had found a stream of clear,\r\ncool water, where they had slaked their thirst.\r\n\r\nThey resumed their route and had not gone far before they heard the\r\nsound of rushing waters. The sound lent wings to Bomba’s feet, and the\r\nfaithful slaves kept pace with him, no matter how fast he went.\r\n\r\nThey came out soon on the banks of a river. The noise of the foaming\r\nwaters had been growing louder and louder until now it smote upon their\r\nears like thunder. A torrent of black water dashed along the river bed\r\nand leaped angrily against the rocks that studded its course, flinging\r\na shower of spray upon Bomba and his companions where they stood at the\r\nedge of the fringe of trees that bordered the river.\r\n\r\n“The River of Death!” muttered Ashati in hushed tones. “It is so that\r\nour people call it.”\r\n\r\n“And it is well named,” said Neram, making a cabalistic sign as though\r\nto ward off evil.\r\n\r\n“Beyond the River of Death,” said Bomba in a voice of impatience,\r\n“though so far away that the eye cannot see it, is the Giant Cataract.\r\nCome, let us be quick. Nascanora and his braves cannot be far away.”\r\n\r\nThey started again, following the course of the stream. Suddenly Neram\r\npaused with his head to one side as though he were listening.\r\n\r\n“Hark!” he said, when Bomba would have questioned him. “Someone comes.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as the words had fallen from his lips, Bomba threw himself upon\r\nthe ground and put his ear to it.\r\n\r\nInstantly he was on his feet again, drawing Ashati and Neram within\r\nthe shelter of the trees, which at that point were growing in great\r\nprofusion.\r\n\r\n“We will watch as silently as the jaguar watches for his prey,” he\r\nhissed. “Let no one move or make a sound.”\r\n\r\nHidden by the rank marsh grass that formed a perfect covert, the three\r\nlay motionless, not a breath betraying their hiding place.\r\n\r\nFor what seemed a long time to the intent watchers, no one appeared in\r\nsight. For all that could be seen, the jungle was free from all human\r\npresence and given over to its animal inhabitants.\r\n\r\nUnseen himself from the bank of the river, only a few yards away, Bomba\r\ncould yet have a perfect view of any living thing that might pass by.\r\nAbsolutely still, as motionless as though he were an image of stone,\r\nhis eyes alone moved to show that he lived and breathed.\r\n\r\nThe faint sound of footsteps that they had heard gradually became more\r\ndistinct, and at last a solitary traveler came into view. The man was\r\nan Indian, but of a tribe with which Bomba was not familiar. He was\r\njourneying swiftly when those concealed in the long grass caught their\r\nfirst glimpse of him, glancing again and again over his shoulder as\r\nthough he feared pursuit.\r\n\r\nMotioning to Neram and Ashati to remain silently where they were, Bomba\r\nwriggled through the underbrush as sinuously as a snake. Not a motion\r\nof the grass betrayed his presence.\r\n\r\nThen, without a sound, as though he had risen from the heart of\r\nthe earth, Bomba leaped to his feet directly in the path of the\r\nunsuspecting native.\r\n\r\nThe fellow started back and opened his mouth to yell, but before a\r\nsound could issue from it Bomba had clapped one lean, brown hand over\r\nhis mouth and with the other had thrown him prone on the ground.\r\n\r\nKneeling on the chest of his captive, who was too paralyzed by the\r\nsuddenness of the attack to make more than a feeble resistance, Bomba\r\ncalled softly to Ashati and Neram. As though, like Aladdin, he had\r\nconjured them by the rubbing of a lamp, they were instantly at his side.\r\n\r\nAt their unexpected appearance, the feeble resistance of the native\r\nceased altogether. He seemed to be stupefied with terror, and stared\r\nfrom one to the other of his captors with red and watery eyes that\r\nbegged for mercy.\r\n\r\n“We will not hurt you,” said Bomba, taking his hand from his prisoner’s\r\nmouth while at the same time he motioned Neram and Ashati to grasp the\r\nfellow, should he seek to break away. “Only tell us what you know and\r\nyou shall go free. But lie to us,” he added, with a significant motion\r\ntoward his machete, “and you die!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND OF SNAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe native writhed and twisted, the eyes bloodshot with terror at the\r\nthreat.\r\n\r\nAshati and Neram came a step nearer with menace in their eyes, and the\r\ncaptive subsided again, gasping and groaning beneath the pressure of\r\nBomba’s knee upon his chest.\r\n\r\n“Do not kill me! Only do not kill me!” he jabbered. “I will answer you!\r\nYou have only to ask.”\r\n\r\n“Then listen to me, and listen well.” The fierce, impatient note was\r\nin Bomba’s voice again. “Nascanora, the great chief, the chief with a\r\nblack heart, is the man I want to find. Give me news of him and you\r\nshall go free.”\r\n\r\nA gleam of hope came into the prisoner’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I will tell. I will tell you anything I know. But you must\r\nnot let Nascanora know that I have told, or he will cut my heart and\r\nfry it over a fire.”\r\n\r\n“Nascanora shall not know,” broke in Bomba, as he lightened somewhat\r\nhis pressure on the man’s chest and bored him through and through with\r\nhis eyes as though to wrench the truth from him. “But if you speak with\r\na forked tongue your place will be with the dead.”\r\n\r\n“I will make straight talk,” asseverated the native. “I do not want to\r\ndie.”\r\n\r\n“Where is Nascanora? Quick!” demanded Bomba.\r\n\r\n“In two days’ time,” replied the trembling native, “he will pass this\r\nspot on the other side of the river.”\r\n\r\n“I thought he had already passed,” said Bomba.\r\n\r\n“He has,” returned the native. “But he turned back to burn another\r\nvillage and take some more captives. He will move slowly, for he has\r\nother enemies that he wants to capture near Snake Island, where lives\r\nthe old witch, Sobrinini----”\r\n\r\nBomba cried out in astonishment and quick hope.\r\n\r\n“You know Sobrinini?” he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\nThe native marked his change of tone, and seemed encouraged by it. His\r\nterror abated, and he spoke so swiftly that the words stumbled over\r\neach other and Bomba could scarcely make out what he said.\r\n\r\n“I know of Sobrinini. Who does not know of her who lives near the Giant\r\nCataract?” he cried. “But I do not go near her island, for it is full\r\nof snakes and Sobrinini is a woman of evil whose frown means death.”\r\n\r\n“Where is this island?” Bomba asked in a fever of eagerness.\r\n\r\n“It is called Snake Island. But to go there is to die.”\r\n\r\nThe native shivered with a superstitious terror as he spoke the words.\r\n\r\nBomba glanced at Ashati and Neram, who had been listening with absorbed\r\ninterest to the story of the native and on whose faces was reflected\r\nthe same look of fright.\r\n\r\nBomba released his hold upon the prisoner and arose to his feet.\r\n\r\n“There are two things I must know,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Command, and you shall be obeyed,” returned the native humbly.\r\n\r\n“Was there a white man among Nascanora’s captives?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot say. He had many captives and he will return as I have said.\r\nThat is all that the jungle has told me.”\r\n\r\n“How do you go to this island where the witch woman, Sobrinini, lives\r\nwith her snakes?” asked Bomba, feeling that the native had spoken the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThe native looked at him with curiosity dawning in his reddened eyes.\r\n\r\n“You will not go there?” he cried in horror. “I tell you it would be\r\nbetter for you to go to the giant anaconda and let him wind his coils\r\nabout your body than to seek out Sobrinini on her island that lies\r\nunder the curse of the gods. I tell you again that to go there is to\r\ndie.”\r\n\r\n“That is for me to say,” replied Bomba. “I do not fear Sobrinini. I do\r\nnot fear her snakes. I have come a far way to see her and I will see\r\nher. Tell me what I want to know. Bomba does not like to ask a thing\r\ntwice.”\r\n\r\nIn response to this imperative demand, the native jabbered out\r\ndirections, telling Bomba the course he must take to reach Snake Island\r\nif he did not wish to be swept to destruction by the rapids of the\r\nRiver of Death.\r\n\r\nWhen Bomba had extracted all the information he could, he motioned the\r\nnative to rise to his feet.\r\n\r\n“Listen!” he said. “If I were Nascanora I would kill you, so as to be\r\nsure that your tongue would be still. But Bomba’s heart is not black\r\nlike that of the chief of the headhunters. I am going to let you go\r\nfree. But if you tell anyone that you have seen me you will find that\r\nBomba’s knife is sharp and his vengeance is swift. Go now and remember\r\nwhat I say.”\r\n\r\nAfter the man had disappeared, Bomba wasted little time in discussing\r\nthe matter with his companions. For if he were to accomplish all he\r\nhoped to before Nascanora should pass that way, he would have to work\r\nhard and fast.\r\n\r\nHe was in a ferment of eagerness to visit Sobrinini and wrest from the\r\nstrange woman the secret of his birth. He was sure she knew. Jojasta\r\nhad said she could tell him. Casson’s queer actions when the name of\r\nSobrinini had been mentioned and his statement that “Nini would know”\r\nhad further confirmed his conviction.\r\n\r\nAs for the terrors that, according to the native, barred access to her,\r\nhe cared not at all. He was used to meeting and overcoming danger. He\r\nwould face anything rather than once more be balked in learning what to\r\nhim was almost as much as life itself.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of Neram and Ashati, he cut down one of the smaller trees\r\nnear the river bank and began the work of hollowing out a portion of\r\nthe trunk in the form of a small canoe.\r\n\r\nIt was hard work and slow, even with the aid of his companions, who\r\nwere skilled in that kind of work, and when the evening shadows fell\r\nalong the banks of the River of Death the canoe was only half done.\r\nImpatient as he was, Bomba was forced to wait till morning for the\r\ncompletion of the work.\r\n\r\nAt the break of dawn Bomba was at work again. Ashati helped him, while\r\nNeram went off in search of jaboty eggs so that they could conserve\r\ntheir remaining supply of meat.\r\n\r\nSome time later he returned, triumphantly displaying six large eggs.\r\n\r\n“There were more there, but I could not carry them,” he said, as he\r\nbuilt a fire with which to prepare breakfast. “I saw a tapir, too, but\r\ncould not kill him because I had gone out without my bow and arrows.”\r\n\r\n“Foolish one to hunt without weapons,” reproved Ashati, looking up for\r\na moment from his work. “Ashati would know better.”\r\n\r\n“The next time Ashati shall do the hunting,” returned Neram, and went\r\non stolidly with his preparations.\r\n\r\nBy the time the sun was high in the heavens the crude canoe was\r\nfinished. A paddle was then fashioned from a sapling, that for all its\r\nslenderness was strong enough to breast the current of even that raging\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nTheir temporary captive had explained to Bomba that he must launch his\r\nboat at some little distance up the river, where the current was not\r\nso strong. From there he could let himself go with the rushing waters\r\nuntil he came to a place where the waters widened out and were not so\r\ntumultuous.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached this portion of the stream, the native had said, he\r\nwould see at a distance a long island, the shape of a finger, extending\r\ninto the river. After he had reached and passed this on the eastern\r\nside, he would find himself in a place more easily navigable for his\r\nsmall craft.\r\n\r\nUp this calmer stretch of water Bomba had been directed to paddle until\r\nhe should come in sight of Snake Island, half hidden behind a jutting\r\npoint of the mainland.\r\n\r\nBomba had taken it for granted that Ashati and Neram would accompany\r\nhim. There was room for the three of them, and there would be less\r\ndanger of capsizing if the canoe were well weighted down.\r\n\r\nBut though they helped him willingly to carry the canoe to the portion\r\nof the river where it would be safe to launch it, they seemed so\r\nterrified when Bomba spoke of his eagerness to reach Snake Island that\r\nthe lad stared at them with amazement.\r\n\r\n“You are afraid to go?” he asked.\r\n\r\nPoor Ashati and Neram flinched before his accusing gaze and hung down\r\ntheir heads. For a long moment there was silence, and then Ashati\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n“This Sobrinini is a witch and her island is full of snakes. If she is\r\na witch, she can make the snakes do her bidding. Did not the caboclo\r\nsay that to go there was to die?”\r\n\r\nBomba pondered for a while, staring at his companions. He had not their\r\nsuperstition, but he could put himself in their places and understand\r\ntheir feelings.\r\n\r\n“You have not the reason to seek out Sobrinini that I have,” he\r\nconceded. “Perhaps that is what makes me blind to dangers that you see.\r\nBomba will go alone. You stay here till I get back.”\r\n\r\nAt this they cast themselves at his feet, crying out that they would go\r\nwith him in spite of their dread of Sobrinini and her island of snakes.\r\n\r\nBut Bomba would not accept such a sacrifice on their part, and\r\npersisted in setting off alone.\r\n\r\nThey dropped the canoe into the water, and almost before Bomba had time\r\nto get into it the current caught the frail bark and sent it dancing\r\nout upon the swirling waters like a feather caught in the wind.\r\n\r\nThe jungle boy needed all his skill to keep the tossing craft on an\r\neven keel and set a straight course down the river. When he could at\r\nlast look back, he could see Neram and Ashati standing on the bank like\r\nbronzed statues, looking after him. He knew that in their hearts they\r\nnever expected to see him again.\r\n\r\nOn he went down the river, the canoe caught now by one current, now by\r\nanother, sometimes dipping to one side at so sharp an angle that it\r\nseemed it must capsize, then righting itself and dancing on again over\r\nthe frothing black water--a frail barrier between Bomba and destruction.\r\n\r\nOnce the canoe was caught in the iron grip of a cross-current and\r\nrushed at a furious speed toward the rocks that at that point lined the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nBomba had need of all his strength. Putting all his force upon the\r\npaddle, he grazed the murderous rocks by the fraction of an inch, and\r\nslid lightly, gently into a stretch of calmer water.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous part of his water journey was now over. All he had\r\nto do now was to avoid the rocks that at places pushed their heads\r\nabove the water and the snags formed by parts of the trunks of trees\r\nthat had grown on what was dry ground before the stream had extended\r\nits borders and swallowed them up.\r\n\r\nBut there were other “snags” too--living snags! The rough, gnarled\r\nbodies of great alligators that swam or floated lazily about, their\r\nbacks just showing above the surface. Many were wholly or half asleep,\r\nothers turned red and evil eyes on the solitary boatman as he sped\r\nby. Bomba, remembering his last experience with the ferocious brutes,\r\nshuddered to think of what would happen to him if by some evil chance\r\nhis canoe should be overturned.\r\n\r\nHe found the island that was shaped like a finger, and worked his\r\ncraft about the further end of it, heading upstream as the native had\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\nThis was more tedious work than his progress downstream had been, but\r\nfar less perilous. Bomba paddled with a will, his heart beating high\r\nwith hope as he thought that every stroke was bringing him nearer to\r\nSobrinini and the secret whose answer he was so eager to know.\r\n\r\nIf he shared to some extent the fears that had taken such strong\r\npossession of Ashati and Neram in regard to Sobrinini and her island\r\nof snakes, his eagerness to learn from the lips of the old witch woman\r\nthose facts about his parentage that had been so long denied him drove\r\nall other feelings from his mind.\r\n\r\nBut as time passed and still each bend of the river failed to disclose\r\nany island answering to the description given by the native, Bomba\r\nbecame anxious and quickened the long, sweeping strokes of his paddle.\r\n\r\nCould the native have deceived him? Was the fellow chuckling at that\r\nvery moment at the way he had deceived the white boy who had waylaid\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nBomba hardly thought so. The man had spoken under the fear of death,\r\nif he spoke falsely. He knew how indefinite was the native idea of\r\ndistance. He had heard Casson say in the old days that when a caboclo\r\nsaid a place was “not far” he might mean just beyond a bend of the road\r\nor twenty miles away.\r\n\r\nBomba’s first uneasiness came with the lengthening of the evening\r\nshadows. Even if the native had not misled him and his course was the\r\ntrue one, Bomba did not relish the idea of approaching the island in\r\nthe dark, or even at early dusk.\r\n\r\nBut even as these thoughts troubled his mind and the shadows grew\r\ndeeper, he rounded another bend of the river and saw before him the\r\nobject of his search. He could not be mistaken. The position and shape\r\nof the island were exactly as the native had described them.\r\n\r\nAs Bomba, with quickened pulse, drove his canoe among the heavy rushes\r\nthat half concealed the land from anyone upon the river, the sound of\r\nsinging came to him.\r\n\r\nIt was not one of the tribal songs of natives with which he was\r\nfamiliar.\r\n\r\nIt was singing such as he had never heard before, and the voice of the\r\nsinger was so thin and eerie and unearthly in that solitary spot that\r\nBomba felt the hair rise on his scalp.\r\n\r\n“Sobrinini!” muttered the lad, and with a trembling hand parted the\r\nbushes from before his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nAMID WRITHING SERPENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sight that met Bomba’s eyes was horrible beyond anything he had\r\never seen or imagined.\r\n\r\nAt the extreme end of the island, in mud that oozed about her ankles,\r\nan old withered crone was performing a weird dance, singing to herself\r\nas she did so in a language that was strange to Bomba.\r\n\r\nBut that was not the part of the performance that held Bomba\r\nspellbound, horror-stricken.\r\n\r\nIt was the snakes, the ropes of slimy, hideous reptiles that the old\r\nwoman wound about her arms, her waist, her neck, even her face, as she\r\ndanced faster and ever faster to the strains of her weird, high-pitched\r\nsong.\r\n\r\nIt was then that fear entered into Bomba, a fear such as had never\r\nbeen felt by him when he battled with the wild beasts of the jungle.\r\nThen he had fought with things of flesh and blood, with something he\r\ncould understand. But what he saw now seemed to be tinctured by the\r\nsupernatural. His flesh crawled. The scene was revolting and horrible\r\nbeyond description.\r\n\r\nThis must be Sobrinini, this hag that played with and fondled and\r\npetted these hissing reptiles that wound their coils about her body.\r\nShe must be a witch, as the native had claimed. How otherwise could she\r\ndo a thing like this and remain unharmed?\r\n\r\nAnd if she was a witch--and to Bomba’s primitive, half-taught mind this\r\ndid not seem at all impossible--she might have it within her power to\r\nlay a spell upon him, if she wished. Perhaps she might turn him into\r\none of those very snakes that hissed and writhed about her.\r\n\r\nAt the thought, Bomba was tempted to flee from the spot. But something\r\nin him, stronger even than his fear, drew him resistlessly toward that\r\nweird figure on the river bank.\r\n\r\nHe worked the canoe in as far toward the island as he dared and wedged\r\nit tightly among the rushes, trusting that they would hold it for him\r\nuntil he returned.\r\n\r\nHe found that the water was shallow, and silently slipped into it\r\nand waded toward the bank. Dread of the piranhas, a dangerous,\r\nsharp-toothed fish, such as infest all the waters of the jungle,\r\nhurried Bomba’s steps so that he was not as cautious in his approach to\r\nSobrinini as he would otherwise have been.\r\n\r\nAlthough he made for the shore at some distance from the old woman, so\r\nthat he might choose his own time for drawing near her after she had\r\nfinished with the demon-like dance, he slipped, when he tried for a\r\nfooting in the slimy ooze of the river bank, and came down with a heavy\r\nsplash.\r\n\r\nThe sound startled Sobrinini. The weird song died on her withered lips\r\nand she stood staring. The tropic night had fallen now, but a full moon\r\nhad risen, and by the light of it Bomba could be seen as he got to his\r\nfeet and gained the bank.\r\n\r\nAt sight of him, a shrill yell pealed from the lips of the old woman,\r\nwhich brought dark figures running to her from all directions. Bomba\r\nsaw one rise up in front of him as though conjured from the earth by\r\nmagic. He turned to avoid the outstretched arms of this apparition,\r\ndid not see the hole that yawned at his feet, and fell into a nest of\r\nwrithing snakes.\r\n\r\nHe was so paralyzed with horror that he could not move. Perhaps it was\r\nto that that he owed his life. For as the snakes, most of which had\r\nbeen dozing in the slimy ooze at the bottom of the pit, recovered from\r\ntheir surprise and coiled to attack, Sobrinini pushed through the crowd\r\nat the edge of the hole and began to sing.\r\n\r\nIt was a lilting, rhythmic tune, and at the first notes of it the\r\nhideous reptiles surrounding Bomba began to sway to the sound and one\r\nafter another slipped over the edge of the pit and slithered away into\r\nthe darkness.\r\n\r\nBomba climbed out, with the gray mud plastered over him. Still shaken\r\nat the narrowness of his escape from a terrible death, the lad drew\r\nhimself up beside Sobrinini.\r\n\r\nThe ring of natives, male and female, closed in upon Bomba and the old\r\nwitch woman as the sound died on the lips of Sobrinini. Several of the\r\ngroup carried flaring torches, and by this flickering light the scene\r\nseemed as unreal and fantastic as a dream.\r\n\r\nAs Sobrinini saw Bomba before her, she turned upon him with a look so\r\nfierce and malignant that the lad involuntarily drew away from her.\r\n\r\n“You scared my snakes!” she cried accusingly. “For that you should be\r\nburned by fire and flung into the river for the alligators to feast\r\non your flesh. It was for their sakes, not yours, that I saved your\r\nlife, wicked one. My snakes must not be frightened, my little pets--ha,\r\nha, ha!” and she went off into such a fit of horrible merriment that\r\nBomba’s heart froze within him.\r\n\r\nIf at that moment he could have reached his canoe by any means and left\r\nthat fearful place behind him forever, he might have yielded to the\r\ntemptation.\r\n\r\nBut it was too late now. The ring of natives surrounded him, and even\r\nif he succeeded by a bold dash in forcing his way through them, there\r\nwas little chance of escape. They would reach him and drag him back\r\nbefore he could get the canoe clear of the bushes and head for the open\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nThe impulse to flee lasted but a moment. The next, Bomba pulled himself\r\ntogether and was his cool, courageous self once more.\r\n\r\nSobrinini had worked herself into a frenzy of fury. She danced about\r\nBomba in a hideous way, shaking her shriveled fists in the air and\r\nmouthing horribly.\r\n\r\nNow she came close to the lad and pushed her wrinkled face in his.\r\nShe raised an arm above her head as though to strike him. Bomba stood\r\nunflinching.\r\n\r\nShe paused suddenly, arrested apparently by something she saw in his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she cried. “Bring the torches nearer.”\r\n\r\nThe command rang out in a strikingly clear voice and instantly there\r\nwas a stir among the natives. Evidently she was accustomed to being\r\nobeyed without question.\r\n\r\nOne great sullen fellow came forward and thrust his flaring torch\r\nalmost in Bomba’s face.\r\n\r\nSobrinini peered closely at the lad for a moment, and then shrank back\r\nwith a piercing scream.\r\n\r\n“You!” she cried, again coming close and staring at him wildly. “How\r\ncame you here? Are you a ghost, Bartow?”\r\n\r\nInto Bomba’s heart came a swift feeling of amazement.\r\n\r\nWhat was the meaning of this? Like an echo of the words came the memory\r\nof Jojasta’s cry as Bomba had bent above him when he was pinned beneath\r\nthe fallen column. Jojasta had called him Bartow and thought he was a\r\nghost.\r\n\r\nHe took a step toward Sobrinini, who was still staring at him fearfully.\r\n\r\n“What mean you?” he cried.\r\n\r\nSeeing the terror into which their priestess had been thrown, a strange\r\nwild singing rose from the native women as they wove in and out in\r\nfantastic mazes, evidently designed to ward off the evil portent.\r\n\r\nThe bony fingers of Sobrinini closed on Bomba’s arm. Her voice was\r\nshrill and urgent, as she said in his ear:\r\n\r\n“Come with me, Bartow. Ghost or not, come with Sobrinini.”\r\n\r\nAs in a nightmare, his mind in a tumult of conflicting emotions, Bomba\r\nallowed himself to be led away.\r\n\r\nThey passed through dank, long grass that sprang from the marshy\r\nground, and in some places grew as high as Bomba’s head. Once he felt\r\nthe slimy body of a snake beneath his foot and leaped aside, only to\r\nfeel his foot brush another.\r\n\r\n“Be not afraid of the snakes. They are my pets and will not harm anyone\r\nthat is with Sobrinini,” crooned the old crone at his side.\r\n\r\nShe knew her way well, for she moved along the winding trail without\r\never looking down, keeping her fascinated gaze on Bomba’s face.\r\n\r\nTwice Bomba started to ask her what she meant by calling him Bartow and\r\na ghost, but twice he was halted by a bony, shriveled finger on his\r\nlips and a croaking cry:\r\n\r\n“Hush! Speak not, Bartow, or you will break the spell and shatter it\r\ninto a thousand tinkling fragments.”\r\n\r\nShe went on, muttering to herself, until at last they came to a large\r\nwooden building. A flickering light from its gaping windows threw\r\ngrotesque shadows upon the ground.\r\n\r\nBomba felt a dread of entering the place. Like the wild things of the\r\njungle, he felt safer in the open. But Sobrinini’s hand was upon his\r\narm, and she dragged him through the doorway. Her manner grew ever more\r\nfeverish and wild. She seemed possessed by a terrible excitement. Bomba\r\ndid not venture to dispute her will.\r\n\r\nHe found himself in a strange place, the like of which he had never\r\nseen before. Tearing his glance from the withered mask that was the\r\nface of Sobrinini, he looked about him.\r\n\r\nTorches flickered and flared in crude receptacles fastened to the walls\r\nand lighted up the bare and desolate room.\r\n\r\nRows of crude chairs stood upon the uneven wooden floor, and above\r\nthese, halfway to the patched and leaking roof, a tiny balcony had been\r\nconstructed. At either end of this was a small compartment with rounded\r\nfront, meant to represent an opera box, though this of course Bomba\r\ncould not know.\r\n\r\nAt the extreme front of the big room was a raised platform, meant to\r\nserve as a stage of this dismal imitation of an opera house.\r\n\r\nAs Bomba gazed about him, surprised and bewildered, Sobrinini left his\r\nside, and with a horrid simulation of youth skipped to the platform.\r\n\r\nThen she turned and made him a low bow, a hideous smirk cracking the\r\nwrinkles of her withered face.\r\n\r\n“Come closer, Bartow. Come closer, dear Bartow! Do!” she urged, in a\r\nvoice at first soft and coaxing, but that ended in a shrill cackle. “I\r\nwill give you a good seat, Bartow--the best seat in the house--in the\r\nfirst row center. You can hear me better there than from a box. Come!”\r\nshe cried, as he hesitated, her simpering giving place to a terrible\r\nfrown. “Why do you stand there blinking at me like a fool? Do not\r\nrouse my wrath, Bartow! The wrath of Sobrinini is a terrible thing, as\r\nno one should know better than you.”\r\n\r\nBomba came forward quickly, alarmed by the swift change in the old\r\ncrone’s manner. But she simpered and smirked again when he approached,\r\nand, skipping lightly from the platform, forced him with a playfulness\r\nthat Bomba found scarcely less terrifying than her wrath into one of\r\nthe crazy chairs close to the stage.\r\n\r\n“Now I will sing to you!” she cried, and sprang up again upon the\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\nBomba watched with a strange fascination while the old woman danced and\r\nsang in a strange language unknown to him. The lilting songs, even when\r\nsung by that cracked and ruined voice, struck a responsive chord in\r\nthe boy and filled him with emotions that he could neither analyze nor\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nHe did not know that that voice, when in its prime, had thrilled great\r\naudiences that included emperors and kings and had given the singer a\r\nreputation as wide as the civilized world.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Sobrinini paused, and fixing Bomba with a strange intent gaze,\r\nsang in a voice that had magically lost most of its raucous quality and\r\nfor the moment had become the faint, sad echo of something that had\r\nbeen supremely beautiful--sang a tender, haunting melody that touched\r\nsome almost forgotten memory in Bomba’s heart and filled him with an\r\nexquisite pain.\r\n\r\nSomewhere, long since, he had heard that melody! But when and where?\r\n\r\nSlowly the music drew him step by step toward that fantastic figure on\r\nthe stage.\r\n\r\n“Tell me!” he cried imploringly. “Tell me, Sobrinini, was that my\r\nmother’s song?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERY DEEPENS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor an instant the fierce, bright eyes of the old hag softened. Her\r\nbony fingers hovered over Bomba’s hair, as though they would have\r\nstroked it.\r\n\r\nThen she threw back her head and laughed, a harsh, cackling laugh that\r\ncaused Bomba to wince and shrink back as from the sharp thrust of a\r\nknife.\r\n\r\n“Eh, Bartow, you would have a joke with Sobrinini, my fine one,”\r\ncroaked the old crone, wagging her finger in Bomba’s face and leering\r\nat him in a way she meant to be facetious. “No, no, Bartow--or Bartow’s\r\nghost--that was not your mother’s song, but the song of your wife----”\r\n\r\n“My wife!” the words broke from Bomba impetuously. “What mean you,\r\nSobrinini?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you would still have your joke with Sobrinini, eh?” The old woman\r\nleaned forward again and tapped him on the arm with her skinny finger.\r\n“But you cannot forget that song, Bartow, the song your wife sang after\r\nBonny was born.”\r\n\r\nBut when Bomba would have questioned her further, she pushed him away\r\nfrom her and began to sing again.\r\n\r\n“La la la! la la la!” she sang.\r\n\r\nIt was the gay and vibrant melody that poor Casson had tried to sing.\r\n\r\nBomba could do nothing but stand in bewildered silence and watch the\r\nold woman as she danced and sang, whirling about the poor stage with a\r\nnimbleness that was amazing in one of her age.\r\n\r\nConfusedly, he tried to think of the things she had said to him, but\r\nbeneath the wild spell of that performance he could reason nothing out,\r\nand could only stare dazedly at this wreck of what had once been a\r\ngreat genius.\r\n\r\nWhat would happen to him, Bomba wondered, when the woman tired of\r\ndancing and perhaps found out that he was not Bartow or Bartow’s ghost\r\nas she thought him then, but only Bomba, a boy of the jungle.\r\n\r\nWith one last twirl and a deep bow to an imaginary audience, Sobrinini\r\nbrought her weird performance to an end. She grinned toothlessly at the\r\nstaring boy, and skipped lightly to the edge of the platform.\r\n\r\n“Ha, Bartow, like you Sobrinini in the dance that charmed all Paris?”\r\nshe chirped, patting Bomba’s shoulder coquettishly. “Sobrinini has not\r\nlost her art. How say you, Bartow?”\r\n\r\nBomba felt that he must keep her in good humor with him if he were to\r\ngain that information about himself for which he had risked so much. He\r\nhad already learned something--or guessed something. Perhaps he could\r\nlearn more.\r\n\r\n“I like your dance,” he told her gravely. “But I like best the song\r\nthat Bartow’s wife sang when--when----”\r\n\r\n“When Bonny was born?” prompted the old woman, and without waiting for\r\na reply began to hum again that tender melody that had found its way to\r\nthe depths of Bomba’s heart.\r\n\r\nIt thrilled the boy again more strangely than before. When the song was\r\ndone, emotion conquered Bomba’s caution, and he flung out his hands to\r\nSobrinini, begging her to tell him what she knew about Bartow, about\r\nBartow’s wife, about the child that she had called Bonny.\r\n\r\nBut Sobrinini drew back from him, quick suspicion glinting in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“No, no! Not now, Bartow, not now! It is another joke that you play on\r\nSobrinini. No, no! To-night you will sleep here and to-morrow I will\r\npay back your jokes with some of my own. Come! I will show you where\r\nyou are to sleep.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, and mumbling to herself as she had before, the demented\r\nwoman led him out of the strange room with the chairs and platform\r\nthat had so bewildered the boy and down a long, dark passage.\r\n\r\nThere Sobrinini paused and clapped her hands sharply.\r\n\r\nAs though by magic, a figure appeared out of the darkness before them.\r\n\r\n“A torch!” croaked Sobrinini. “A torch to drive the shadows back into\r\nthe night. Bring a torch. Make haste.”\r\n\r\nThe figure disappeared and in a few seconds returned with a light. The\r\nfeatures of the slave seemed savage and sinister in the flickering\r\nillumination.\r\n\r\n“Give it to me! Give it to me!” cried Sobrinini irritably. “Now, slave,\r\nbegone!”\r\n\r\nInstantly the figure vanished again, and Bomba looked about him\r\napprehensively. For a moment he had the fantastic notion that the\r\nshadows all about him were filled with ghostly figures that appeared\r\nand disappeared by magic and made no noise.\r\n\r\nBut Sobrinini stalked before him, flaring torch in hand. Bomba followed\r\nher into a room so small that the farthest corners were made bright by\r\nthe wavering light of the torch.\r\n\r\nAs Bomba entered the place he had a strange feeling that he had seen it\r\nbefore, had been in it before, had once looked about him as he was now\r\nlooking at the few articles of furniture and the pictures on the walls.\r\n\r\nBut even while he felt this so strongly that it seemed almost uncanny,\r\nBomba knew that it could not be so and that it was impossible he had\r\never enacted this scene or anything like it before.\r\n\r\nIn all his wild life in the jungle, he had never seen anything like\r\nthat strange object in one corner of the room, raised from the floor by\r\nposts and covered with a cloth. If Bomba had been told that the strange\r\nobject was a bed, he would have been no better informed than before. As\r\nfar as he could remember, he had never slept in anything like that in\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nWhile he was taking in the various features of the room, Sobrinini\r\ndeposited the torch in a socket on the wall and turned again to Bomba.\r\n\r\n“Bartow,” she said, and there was that softened light in her wild eyes\r\nthat had appeared there while she was singing the tender lullaby that\r\nBartow’s wife had crooned to Bonny, “this is where you sleep while you\r\nremain with Sobrinini on her island. Good-night, Bartow, or Bartow’s\r\nghost, and pleasant dreams!”\r\n\r\nThen she turned and, noiselessly as a ghost or a shadow, glided from\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nBomba stood where she had left him, motionless.\r\n\r\nWhat was that strange feeling that made his heart swell within him\r\nuntil he could not bear the pain of it, that made him reach out wildly,\r\nbeseechingly, for some vague, beautiful thing that he had never known,\r\nor only dimly remembered?\r\n\r\nWhat was it that suddenly made him feel his loneliness and desolation\r\nmore keenly than he had ever felt it in his life, as though he had been\r\ngiven for a moment a glimpse of something warm and friendly and sweet,\r\nonly to have the curtain fall again and leave him in his solitude, more\r\nutterly alone than he had ever been before?\r\n\r\nWhat was it that drew him haltingly, almost fearfully, across the tiny\r\nroom to stop beneath a picture on the wall and, with his hungry eyes\r\nupraised, stare at it intently?\r\n\r\nBomba could not tell. He only knew that within him there was a growing\r\ntumult of emotions, fear, hope, doubt, and a longing so fierce that it\r\nwas pain.\r\n\r\nInto the jungle lad’s upturned, pleading face the beautiful eyes in\r\nthe picture looked steadily and gravely down. It was a lovely face,\r\ngirlish and sweet, with soft hair waved back from a broad, low forehead\r\nand with eyes one knew were soft and dark. The lips turned up at the\r\ncorners, half-smiling.\r\n\r\nBomba had never seen that beautiful pictured face before, as far as\r\nhe could remember. Then how was it that those great eyes looking into\r\nhis, those sweet lips parted as though to speak to him, touched\r\na chord in him that had never before resounded, and increased a\r\nthousandfold his longing for that vague and beautiful thing that he had\r\nnever known?\r\n\r\nShe was even fairer than the woman with the golden hair. Yes, much more\r\nfair and sweet.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Bomba’s eyes were full of tears, and he heard himself crying\r\nin a voice that shook:\r\n\r\n“Mother! Mother!”\r\n\r\nWith both hands upraised toward the beautiful face, Bomba slid slowly\r\nto the floor and lay there, his frame shaking with unaccustomed sobs.\r\n\r\nSoftly, weirdly, tenderly, there floated to the lad, as though from a\r\ngreat distance, the strain of that sweet melody, the song that Bartow’s\r\nwife had sung to Bonny.\r\n\r\nLong after the lullaby had died away Bomba remained there, motionless,\r\ncrouched beneath the picture, one arm before his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nA STARTLING INTERRUPTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWorn out by the exciting adventures and fierce emotions of the day,\r\nBomba fell asleep. When he awoke the chill gray of early dawn was\r\nstealing in at the window of the little room.\r\n\r\nHe was still on the floor beneath the picture. But he would not have\r\nsought the bed in any event. It represented to him something so strange\r\nthat he would probably have been unable to sleep in it. The hard floor\r\non which he now lay or the earth of the jungle or his own hammock was\r\nfar more restful and sleep compelling.\r\n\r\nAt first, only half awake, Bomba had difficulty in remembering the\r\nevents of the day before and why he was in the place where he found\r\nhimself. He sprang to his feet, rubbed his eyes, and looked about him.\r\n\r\nHis eyes fell upon the picture of the beautiful lady, and memory\r\nreturned to him.\r\n\r\nThat tender, sweet melody sung by Sobrinini! Bomba had never heard it\r\ntill lately, as far as he could remember, and yet felt that he had\r\nknown it always. He wondered at the power it had exercised over him.\r\nIt had tugged at his heart as though it would pull it out by the roots.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, he thought, this was the work of Sobrinini. Was she not a\r\nwitch? Certainly, everything he had witnessed since his arrival at\r\nthe island tended to that conclusion. The mortal fear in which her\r\nservitors stood of her would seem to indicate the possession of some\r\nsupernatural power. Had she woven a spell about him, made him seem to\r\nremember things that had never happened?\r\n\r\nYet this spell, if spell it was, had not been a malignant one. It had\r\nmade him strangely happy. The tears that had been forced from him were\r\ntears of joy in the main, and even the melancholy that attended them\r\nhad been tender and sweet.\r\n\r\nAnd this emotion had been so rare in the boy’s lonely life that it\r\nbrought a rush of gratitude toward Sobrinini. He was not afraid of the\r\nweaver of spells and the charmer of serpents. He stood in awe of her,\r\nbut the predominant feeling was of friendship and pity for her demented\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nAnd there was something else that made a tie between them. She had\r\nknown Bartow and Bartow’s wife and Bonny. How much that name sounded\r\nlike Bomba!\r\n\r\nIn the dim light of the growing dawn, Bomba came close to the\r\nbeautiful pictured face on the wall and studied it wistfully. He could\r\nsee love in those eyes as they looked at him. He would ask Sobrinini\r\nfor that picture. Perhaps she would give it to him.\r\n\r\nHe dwelt on it, until every feature was engraved on his memory. From\r\nthat time on, he would always be able to see that face, even when his\r\neyes were closed.\r\n\r\nReluctantly at last he turned away. He had work to do, and time was\r\npressing. He must find out from Sobrinini what he had come to learn.\r\nAnd then he must hurry on in pursuit of the captives of Nascanora. He\r\nmust be at hand when the party passed the point in the river where\r\nAshati and Neram were still waiting for him.\r\n\r\nHe would seek out Sobrinini at once and demand from her an answer to\r\nthe questions that tormented him. He would find out who Bartow was and\r\nwhy he, Bomba, had twice been taken for Bartow or Bartow’s ghost.\r\n\r\nWith these thoughts in mind and forgetful of the fact that he had had\r\nnothing to eat since the afternoon of the day before, Bomba strode into\r\nthe passage and found his way back to the strange room with the chairs\r\nand platform where Sobrinini had sung to him.\r\n\r\nThe place looked changed to him now. It was not so weird nor mysterious\r\nnow that the torches had flickered out and dawn had replaced the\r\nshadows of the night.\r\n\r\nIf Bomba had expected to find Sobrinini there, he was disappointed.\r\nThe great bare hall was deserted, and though he stopped and listened\r\nintently, there was no sign of life anywhere.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly there came to him from a distance the sound of singing.\r\nFirst Sobrinini’s voice--he could not be mistaken in it now--then other\r\nvoices joining in a sort of weird chant that chilled the lad’s blood\r\nyet drew him irresistibly toward the point from which the sound was\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\nSlowly he emerged from the building and found himself enveloped in a\r\nswirling, gray mist.\r\n\r\nYet the sound of the chant served him as a guide, and he went on and\r\non, now coming closer to the singers, then seeming to draw away from\r\nthem as the voices receded.\r\n\r\nAt last, when he was beginning to think that Sobrinini had again laid\r\na spell on him and that the voices were ghostly voices, to be heard by\r\nnone but himself, he saw a dark form emerge from the mist and after it\r\nanother and another.\r\n\r\nBomba stood still and watched. The natives were dancing, flinging their\r\narms about wildly and intoning their weird chant, now harsh and loud,\r\nnow soft like the sighing of the wind through the trees.\r\n\r\nIt was like a dance of ghosts, and it was not alone the chill damp of\r\nthe air that struck cold to Bomba’s heart. He felt as though he were\r\nin some other world, and that an evil one. He had never longed for the\r\nwarmth and brightness of the jungle sun as he did at that moment.\r\n\r\nBut as the natives danced on, as tireless apparently as the ghosts that\r\nBomba half-thought them, the mist began to clear and the sun struck\r\nthrough, causing the moisture upon the dark bodies of the dancers to\r\nglisten.\r\n\r\nThen, in the center of the ring, Bomba beheld Sobrinini, whirling\r\nwildly in a mad dance, long, gray locks streaming about her, and in\r\neach upflung hand the head of a great snake, while the bodies of the\r\nreptiles coiled about her arms and neck.\r\n\r\nBomba felt a sick faintness come upon him as he watched with repulsion\r\nthe loathsome sight. He stepped back a pace or two with an impulse to\r\nshut the scene away from him. But at that moment Sobrinini beheld him\r\nand called to him.\r\n\r\nShe halted in her dance, and the snakes, uncoiling themselves from\r\nabout her arms and neck, as though they knew that their part in the\r\nfrenzied performance was over, slithered off quietly into the long\r\nmarsh grass and sought their lairs.\r\n\r\nSobrinini darted through the ring of breathless natives, and before\r\nBomba had guessed her purpose threw her skinny arms about the boy’s\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n“Bartow! My Bartow!” she cried, in a loud, cracked voice. “Come and\r\ndance with Sobrinini. Come!”\r\n\r\nBut Bomba drew back, striving to disengage himself from the clinging\r\narms of the witch woman. If one of her own loathsome snakes had coiled\r\nabout his neck, he could hardly have felt a greater repulsion.\r\n\r\n“Come! Come, dance with Sobrinini,” the woman said in a wheedling\r\nvoice, as she untwined her shriveled arms to grasp him by the hand. “I\r\nwill call back my snakes, and you shall fondle them to show you that\r\nthey will not fill your veins with poison or crush your bones when\r\nSobrinini is nigh. Come! Why do you draw back? What are you waiting\r\nfor, Bartow?”\r\n\r\n“But I am not Bartow,” blurted out Bomba in his desperation to be rid\r\nof her and learn the truth about himself. “Jojasta, the medicine man\r\nof the Moving Mountain, called me Bartow also. But I am not he. I am\r\nBomba! Bomba, the jungle boy!”\r\n\r\nSobrinini paused, a look of bewilderment overspreading her sharp\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n“Not Bartow? Not Bartow?” she mumbled, coming close to peer into the\r\nlad’s face. “No, no, not Bartow, surely. But then you are Bartow’s\r\nghost.”\r\n\r\n“I am no ghost!” cried Bomba. “Bones are in my body. Blood runs through\r\nmy veins. See--if you prick my flesh, it bleeds.”\r\n\r\nIn his eagerness to prove to the old crone that he was human and no\r\nghostly visitor, Bomba drew forth his machete and thrust the sharp\r\npoint of it into his brown, sinewy forearm. Blood welled up from the\r\nslight cut, red, pulsing blood.\r\n\r\n“See--I am no ghost!” cried the lad again. “Ghosts do not have blood.\r\nGhosts do not have bones. One can walk through ghosts as one walks\r\nthrough the mists of the early morning. Let anyone try to walk through\r\nme, Bomba, the jungle boy!”\r\n\r\nThe natives had stopped dancing and singing their wild invocation to\r\nthe dawn. Now they stood in a half circle about Sobrinini and Bomba,\r\nlooking on curiously.\r\n\r\nAt Bomba’s challenge, not one of them stirred. He looked exceedingly\r\ndangerous, standing in all his splendid strength with the sunlight\r\nglinting on the red point of his upraised machete. It would not be well\r\nto try to walk through him.\r\n\r\nThe puzzled expression had deepened upon the face of Sobrinini. She\r\nstood regarding Bomba with bewilderment and a dawning suspicion.\r\n\r\n“Then if you are not Bartow and no ghost,” she demanded, “who are you?”\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly all the lad’s long groping for the truth, his passionate\r\neagerness to learn the facts concerning his parents, the many\r\ndisappointments he had suffered and the realization of his desperate\r\nloneliness rushed over him in an overwhelming flood, and filled him\r\nwith emotion that found vent in a headlong torrent of words.\r\n\r\n“Who am I? If I could give you the answer to that question, Sobrinini,\r\nI would not be here. I know nothing about myself except that I am\r\nBomba, a boy of the jungle, and have spent my life with Cody Casson on\r\nthe edge of the swamp. Casson could not tell me who I am nor who my\r\nfather and my mother were. He sent me to Jojasta, and Jojasta before\r\nhe died said, ‘Go to Sobrinini, she will tell you!’ I have come,\r\nSobrinini.”\r\n\r\nHe took a step toward her, hands outstretched.\r\n\r\nAt that instant there was a wild yell, and a native, panting, the sweat\r\nstreaming from him, dashed toward them and flung himself at the feet of\r\nSobrinini.\r\n\r\n“The Great Spirit of the Jungle save us!” cried the frightened wretch,\r\ntrembling as with the ague. “The headhunters have come! The great\r\nchief, Nascanora, is at hand!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nIN THE HANDS OF THE HEADHUNTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a chorus of frightened exclamations and a wild scattering of\r\nthe natives that showed the dread that Nascanora’s name inspired in all\r\nthe people of that region.\r\n\r\nIn a twinkling, Sobrinini and Bomba found themselves alone.\r\n\r\nThe old woman herself had grown ashen. She grasped Bomba by the hand.\r\n\r\n“Come!” she said. “I will hide you. Quick!”\r\n\r\nBut even as she spoke there was a wild yell from the forest, and a\r\nhorde of savages, headed by Nascanora himself, burst into the clearing.\r\n\r\nBomba had drawn his knife, determined to sell his life dearly. Seeing\r\nhis threatening attitude, the savages were rushing on him with spears\r\nheld high when a command from Nascanora halted them.\r\n\r\n“Do not kill him--now,” he commanded. “That would be too easy. His\r\ndeath, when it comes, must be hard and long. And after that his head\r\nshall stand on the wigwam to show how Nascanora deals with his enemies.”\r\n\r\nSobrinini stepped forward, her eyes glaring.\r\n\r\n“Beware what you do, Nascanora,” she warned. “Leave this boy alone\r\nand go your way lest I put my spell upon you. It is not well to make\r\nSobrinini angry.”\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur of uneasiness among the savages, for the fame of\r\nSobrinini as a witch had gone far and wide. That Nascanora himself was\r\nnot wholly unmoved was evident from the way he evaded the blazing eyes\r\nof the old woman.\r\n\r\nBut he was made of sterner stuff than his followers, and he had come\r\ntoo far to be balked of his prey.\r\n\r\n“I would have no quarrel with Sobrinini,” he said placatingly. “I do\r\nnot wish to hurt her or her people. But the boy must go with me. Else I\r\nwill kill all the people on this island and take their heads along for\r\nthe women of my tribe to rejoice over. Nascanora has spoken!”\r\n\r\nBefore Sobrinini could speak, Bomba intervened. To fight against such\r\nodds was hopeless. Flight was equally impossible. He must submit to\r\ncapture, and trust to his quick wit and courage to escape later.\r\n\r\n“Listen, Sobrinini!” he said. “They are many, and I do not wish that\r\nyour people should die. I will go with Nascanora. But first,” he\r\nadded, turning to the chief, whose eyes were glowing with a baleful\r\nglare of triumph, “I would ask Nascanora a question.”\r\n\r\n“Speak!” said the chief.\r\n\r\n“Nascanora is a great chief,” said Bomba. “He is not afraid of anyone.\r\nIs it not so?”\r\n\r\n“It is so,” replied Nascanora, rather astonished at the tribute, but\r\nswelling with pride.\r\n\r\n“Then will Nascanora fight Bomba alone?” asked the lad. “Fight him with\r\nknives?”\r\n\r\nIf a bomb had been thrown into the midst of the savages it would not\r\nhave created greater surprise. They looked at each other in amazement.\r\nWas the boy mad?\r\n\r\nThe most astounded of all was Nascanora himself. He could not believe\r\nhis ears. To be bearded thus, he, Nascanora, in the presence of his\r\nbraves and by a boy! His eyes glowed with fury and his face grew dark\r\nwith menace.\r\n\r\n“Such idle words will make your death still harder,” he threatened. “It\r\nis not well to mock Nascanora.”\r\n\r\n“I do not mock,” returned Bomba quietly. “I would make a compact with\r\nNascanora. I will fight him with knives. We can throw the knives or\r\nfight hand to hand, as Nascanora chooses. But Nascanora must swear by\r\nhis gods and command his braves that, if he is killed, the captives\r\nshall go free. It is for their freedom that I will fight Nascanora.\r\nSurely he is not afraid.”\r\n\r\nLithe, supple, muscular, his head held high as he flung out the\r\nconcluding taunt, Bomba gazed full into the glowering eyes of the\r\nchief. He hoped that Nascanora would be goaded into accepting the\r\nchallenge. The boy was a master of the machete, either thrust or\r\nthrown. If he should conquer, as he felt sure he would, his victory at\r\none stroke would free the captives. If he should lose--well, that was\r\nin the hands of fate.\r\n\r\nNascanora’s face was a study. It was working with rage that did not\r\nhide, however, a shade of apprehension. He had tested the boy’s courage\r\non one previous occasion, and had learned to respect it. He towered\r\nover his captive in size, but he doubted whether he exceeded him in\r\nstrength. And he doubted very much whether he equaled him in skill and\r\nagility.\r\n\r\nThe chief was in a quandary. He knew that his braves were looking on\r\nand wondering at his hesitation. On the other hand, life was dear to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe glared at Bomba. The lad looked unflinchingly at him. And in the\r\nduel of eyes, Nascanora’s were the first to fall.\r\n\r\n“It is not for a great chief like Nascanora to fight with a boy,” he\r\nblustered, seeking to cover his defeat. “He shall learn what happens\r\nto them who speak boastful words to Nascanora. Bind his hands and we\r\nwill go.”\r\n\r\nThe command was quickly obeyed. Sobrinini again attempted to interpose,\r\nbut Bomba checked her.\r\n\r\n“Sobrinini is good,” he said, “but there is no reason why she and her\r\npeople should be killed. Bomba will go, but he will come back again.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” she whispered agitatedly. “You will come back. You are\r\nbrave. You made Nascanora’s heart turn to water. Sobrinini can see into\r\nthe future. You will come back, and then I will tell you what you want\r\nto know.”\r\n\r\nBomba would have urged her to tell him then, but he was roughly\r\nhurried away, leaving Sobrinini to wring her withered hands and mutter\r\ninvocations to her gods.\r\n\r\nDespite his dangerous plight, Bomba found himself in a strangely\r\nbuoyant frame of mind. He still felt the exaltation that came from his\r\ntriumph over Nascanora. He had shamed him in the eyes of his braves.\r\nPerhaps that would weaken his prestige with them and make ultimate\r\nescape easier.\r\n\r\nHe was not oblivious, of course, to the fact that his defiance had made\r\nNascanora a more bitter enemy than ever. He watched the angry figure\r\nstriding along at the head of his braves. Doubtless at this moment the\r\nchief was thinking of some fiendish mode of torture with which to\r\nslake his thirst for revenge.\r\n\r\nBefore long they reached the part of the island where Nascanora had\r\ndisembarked. Here two great war canoes were drawn up. Bomba was pushed\r\ninto one of them, then the natives got in. With a few swift thrusts of\r\nthe paddle the canoes were sent into the center of the stream. Then\r\nthey headed their course for the mainland.\r\n\r\nThe savages were familiar with the rapids, and, evading the pitfalls of\r\nthe river, rapidly neared the other shore.\r\n\r\nAs they drew closer, Bomba saw the rest of Nascanora’s band camped\r\nclose to the shore. In the ring they formed he could see a group of\r\ndejected figures, evidently the captives.\r\n\r\nThe canoes touched the bank. Bomba was pulled out by a couple of braves\r\nand thrust into the crowd of prisoners. His eyes flew from face to face.\r\n\r\nThey rested on the frail, tired visage of an old man who rose and\r\ntottered toward him.\r\n\r\n“Casson!” cried Bomba.\r\n\r\n“Bomba!” exclaimed Casson pantingly as he threw his arms about the\r\nboy’s shoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE GIANT CATARACT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old man sobbed as he hugged the lad to his breast.\r\n\r\nBomba’s joy at the reunion was no less, though his bound hands\r\nprevented him from returning the embrace.\r\n\r\nWhen at last they stood apart and looked fondly at each other, Bomba\r\nwas grieved to the heart to see the ravages that the hardships and\r\nmiseries of the journey had made in the face and frame of the old\r\nnaturalist. The first was so thin as to be almost transparent, and the\r\nlatter had wasted to a shadow.\r\n\r\nBut he was still alive. Bomba had not come too late to see him once\r\nmore in the flesh. He would still have a chance of rescuing him and\r\ntaking him back to the old cabin where he could end his days in peace.\r\nBut the boy’s heart sank as he looked at the bonds on his own wrists\r\nand realized how slight his chances were to rescue anybody while he was\r\na captive himself.\r\n\r\nWhen their first emotion had somewhat subsided, Bomba had time to look\r\nabout for the others that he knew. Many faces were strange to him,\r\nand it was evident that, from the headhunters’ point of view, their\r\nforay had been crowned with great success. They were carrying back an\r\nunusually large number of prisoners, some to be tortured and killed,\r\nothers to drag out a lifetime of misery.\r\n\r\nBomba’s eyes lighted on Pipina, who came forward eagerly and threw her\r\narms about his neck with an outburst of tears and broken ejaculations.\r\nAlso, there was Hondura, the Araos chief, who greeted him merely with a\r\ngrunt and the habitual stolidity of his race.\r\n\r\nThen his eyes fell upon Pirah, the young daughter of Hondura, who,\r\nherself unbound, came running toward him with outstretched arms.\r\n\r\nShe clasped Bomba’s hands fondly, noting sorrowfully that they were\r\nbound, and snuggled close up to him, smiling in his face. He reached\r\ndown, and as she drew near, rubbed her cheek with his.\r\n\r\n“Is Bomba glad to see Pirah?” she asked almost happily.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered the boy, forbearing to add that he would far rather\r\nnever have seen her at all than to see her in such a position. “Pirah\r\nsaved Bomba’s life when he came to the village of the Araos, and Bomba\r\nwill never forget.”\r\n\r\n“But no, Bomba, you must not be glad. We are captives,” and the\r\nchild’s bright face clouded. “We go as slaves. You may not teach me,\r\nas you did before, to shoot the bow and arrow. Do you remember when\r\nyou came to our village that you showed me how to use your bow? But\r\nnow--oh, what is to become of you, of me?”\r\n\r\nEvery word the little girl uttered stabbed Bomba to the heart. She\r\nhad saved his life once. She was his friend, and he had all too few\r\nfriends. He shuddered to think of what might be the fate of this\r\ninnocent child in the hands of the savage headhunters.\r\n\r\nTheir captors were preparing to break camp and were so busy with their\r\npacking that for the time the prisoners were left to themselves. That\r\ngave Bomba his chance to get together with Casson, Hondura and Pipina,\r\nand exchange experiences.\r\n\r\nHe learned, to his relief, that they had not been treated as harshly as\r\nhe had feared. Their captors had kept them fairly well fed. But they\r\nhad told them frankly and gleefully why they did this. They wanted them\r\nto be strong enough to endure for a long time the tortures that would\r\nbe meted out to them at the great festival that would attend the entry\r\nof the triumphant warriors into their village.\r\n\r\nBut however fiendish might be the motive, the fact remained that the\r\nprisoners were fairly strong and well. Bomba was glad of this, as\r\nit would facilitate matters if a chance offered to make a break for\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nHe told them in detail of his own adventures, not neglecting the way he\r\nhad shamed Nascanora, at which they laughed gleefully. And he brought\r\nnew courage to them by telling them that the Araos, with all the\r\nstrength they could muster from other tribes, were following on their\r\ntrail. At any time now they might appear in sight and deliver them.\r\n\r\nWhile he was talking he looked up and saw two figures approaching him.\r\nThey were downcast and abject and held their faces so low on their\r\nbreasts that at first he did not recognize them. But as they drew\r\nnearer, he saw that they were Ashati and Neram.\r\n\r\n“You here, too?” he said, as they squatted down beside him.\r\n\r\n“Yes, master,” Ashati answered for both, while Neram nodded his head\r\ndespondently.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry,” said Bomba. “How did it come that you fell into the hands\r\nof Nascanora?”\r\n\r\n“We were waiting for you near the bank of the river,” replied Ashati,\r\n“when we heard the march of feet. We hid in the jungle, hoping that the\r\nenemy would go past and not see us. But they had with them the man you\r\ncaught and who told you the way to go to the island of Sobrinini. He\r\nled them to the place where you met him, and they beat the bushes till\r\nthey found us.”\r\n\r\n“And that man told Nascanora that I had gone to the island, and that is\r\nwhy they came there for me!” exclaimed Bomba.\r\n\r\n“We should have killed the man while we had him on the ground,” stated\r\nNeram.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bomba. “But it would have been well to have bound him and\r\nleft him with you until after Nascanora had passed by. Yet the man\r\nswore by his gods that he would not tell.”\r\n\r\n“Nascanora has ways of making men speak,” put in Ashati significantly.\r\n\r\n“His heart is as black as Jojasta’s was,” declared Neram, as though\r\nthat summed up the total of human depravity. “He will torture us with\r\nfire and steel and then place our heads on the wigwams of his people.”\r\n\r\n“I do not think so,” said Bomba. “Sobrinini told me that I would get\r\naway from him. And Bomba will not leave his friends Ashati and Neram\r\nbehind.”\r\n\r\nThe news helped to dissipate the gloom on the countenances of the\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n“If Sobrinini said so, it must be true!” exclaimed Ashati, “for she is\r\na witch.”\r\n\r\n“The greatest in all the jungle,” confirmed Neram. “She is very wise.\r\nHer snakes whisper in her ears and tell her what will be in the days\r\nto come.”\r\n\r\nThey turned away much cheered and comforted, and just then their\r\ncaptors gave the signal for the march.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were herded roughly together in the center of the\r\nmarching columns, so that there could be no possible chance to escape.\r\nFortunately, they had had a long rest while the war party under\r\nNascanora had been making the raid on Snake Island, so they were in\r\nfairly good condition for the journey, and that the journey would not\r\nbe a long one was now evident from the thunderous sound that grew\r\never louder and louder in their ears. They were approaching the Giant\r\nCataract, where dwelt Nascanora and his people.\r\n\r\nTo the hapless prisoners, that sound was like the knell of doom.\r\n\r\nThe thunderous sound increased in volume, and suddenly at a turn in the\r\ntrail, the most magnificent sight that Bomba had ever seen burst upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey had reached the Giant Cataract!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nRUSPAK GLOATS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a great bluff, hundreds of feet in height, a huge torrent of water\r\npoured down into a gorge beneath and rose again in an ocean of spray.\r\nThe sound was deafening. The mass of waters gleamed with all the colors\r\nof the rainbow. It was almost beyond the imagination of a dreamer.\r\n\r\nIt made Bomba catch his breath and stand entranced. For a few minutes\r\nhe forgot that he was a prisoner, forgot the horrors that might await\r\nhim. His soul drank in the beauty of this mighty cataract and its\r\nsplendor. He had heard of its wonders, but had never dreamed it could\r\nbe like this.\r\n\r\nBut there was little time to dwell on its grandeur and sublimity. The\r\nharsh voices of their guards drove the prisoners on. To the besotted\r\nminds of their captors the cataract was nothing, except that it\r\nsignified that they were once more at home and now could revel in the\r\ntorture of their victims.\r\n\r\nThe main village lay near the foot of the fall, and from this now came\r\npouring out the women and children and old men of the tribe.\r\n\r\nThere were shouts of delight as they saw the number of prisoners that\r\ntheir warriors had brought with them. They gathered about the captives,\r\ntaunting and jeering at them and striking them with sticks until the\r\nguards intervened, not out of pity, but in order that the captives\r\nmight be kept in good condition for the horrid festival that Nascanora\r\nwas planning.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners passed through the streets of the village and their\r\nhearts sank, for they saw the human heads, shriveled and blackened\r\nby the sun, that were fastened on poles on the tops of the wigwams.\r\nThey had evidently been there a long time. Now a new collection was in\r\nprospect.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the village was a rough stockade. Into this the\r\nprisoners were corralled and left under the supervision of guards,\r\nwhile the others of the band dispersed to their homes.\r\n\r\nThe captives sank down under a pall of horror. This, then, was the end\r\nof the trail. A day or two more, while their captors were preparing for\r\nthe great festival of blood, and then torture and death.\r\n\r\nThe only calm and collected person in the whole enclosure was Bomba.\r\nNot that he was dwelling in a fool’s paradise. He did not disguise from\r\nhimself the awfulness of the situation. But he faced it unflinchingly.\r\nHis courage had never been at a higher pitch. His mind had never worked\r\nmore clearly. He could die, and die bravely, if need be. But he meant\r\nto live.\r\n\r\nHe was making things as comfortable as he could for Casson and little\r\nPirah when he heard his name spoken. He looked up quickly and saw\r\nbefore him Ruspak, the medicine man.\r\n\r\nIt was Ruspak that Bomba had once captured in the jungle and compelled\r\nto accompany him to the cabin where Casson lay at the point of death.\r\nAgainst his will, Ruspak had been forced to minister to the sick man,\r\nwhom his native medicines finally brought back from the grave. When\r\nthis had been done, Bomba had dismissed the medicine man with gifts and\r\nthey had parted with professions of friendship.\r\n\r\nBut how insincere those professions had been on the part of Ruspak and\r\nhow deeply he had resented the affront to his dignity as a medicine man\r\nwas evident now by the malignity in his eyes and the gloating smile on\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\n“So Bomba, the mighty Bomba, is a prisoner in the hands of Nascanora!”\r\nhe jeered. “He finds now what happens to one who insults the messenger\r\nof the gods.”\r\n\r\nBomba looked at him quietly, but made no answer.\r\n\r\n“Where now is the white man’s magic?” Ruspak sneered, as he looked\r\nmockingly at Casson. “Where is the puma that kept guard before the\r\ndoor?”\r\n\r\nStill Bomba kept quiet, and looked at his tormentor with a contempt\r\nthat stung Ruspak to the quick.\r\n\r\n“So Bomba has lost his tongue,” snapped the medicine man. “But\r\nNascanora will find that tongue. He will pull it out with redhot\r\npincers. Then he will cool Bomba’s mouth with water. You came to the\r\nGiant Cataract. You see plenty water. Bomba shall have water. We will\r\nfill his body with it till he bursts.”\r\n\r\nStill Bomba disdained to answer.\r\n\r\n“Bomba is strong,” mocked Ruspak. “Very strong. That is good. He can\r\nstand torture for a long time before he dies. His eyes can be plucked\r\nout, and still he will live. He can be burned with torches in a hundred\r\nplaces and still he will live. His fingers can be cut off one by one,\r\nand still he will live. Death will seem very sweet to Bomba. He will\r\npray for it, but it will be a long time before it comes. Nascanora will\r\nsee to that.”\r\n\r\nBut all his recital of the horrid tortures that were preparing for\r\nBomba failed to elicit a single word from the contemptuous captive, and\r\nRuspak at last left him and went away, mumbling to himself and licking\r\nhis lips in anticipation.\r\n\r\nBomba turned to Casson and Hondura, who were seated near by. He hoped\r\nthat they had not heard all that Ruspak had said. But the tears in the\r\nfaded eyes of Casson showed that he had heard all too clearly and that\r\nhis heart was wrung with anguish.\r\n\r\n“Do not mind him,” the lad soothed the old man, as he patted him on\r\nthe shoulder. “He speaks big words, but they are like the wind in the\r\ntrees. If my hands had not been bound, it would have been a bad thing\r\nfor Ruspak.”\r\n\r\n“He has a black heart and a tongue that is as bitter as the aloe\r\nplant,” said Hondura.\r\n\r\nBomba glanced around to see that none of the sentries were observing\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Hondura,” he said, “slip your hand under the puma skin that covers my\r\nchest, reach up near my neck and tell me what you find.”\r\n\r\nHondura did so, and drew back his hand quickly as it touched something\r\nhard and sharp.\r\n\r\n“It is your machete,” he whispered.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Bomba in the same low tone. “I hung it there in a noose\r\nwhen I heard the headhunters were coming. After they had bound my\r\nhands, they were in such a hurry to get away from the witch, Sobrinini,\r\nthat they did not search me. They thought of it afterward, but when\r\nthey looked for it in my belt it was gone, and they thought I had lost\r\nit or left it in Sobrinini’s house. But it is here, and it will be a\r\ngood friend to Bomba.”\r\n\r\nHondura’s eyes lighted up as he grunted his satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“It may yet find the heart of Nascanora,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” assented Bomba. “But first the hands of Bomba must be free.\r\nWhen it is dark, Hondura will take the knife and cut the bonds of\r\nBomba, not all the way, or the guards may notice, but so near through\r\nthat Bomba can burst them when he wills.”\r\n\r\n“Hondura will do so,” promised the Araos chief.\r\n\r\nThe tropic night soon fell and the darkness was made more intense than\r\nusual by the absence of moon or stars. A great storm was gathering.\r\nClaps of thunder deafened their ears and vivid lightning flashes shot\r\nacross the sky.\r\n\r\nBefore long the windows of heaven were opened, and the rain came down\r\nin a deluge. It was a veritable cloudburst.\r\n\r\nThere was a shedlike structure in the stockade, used for storage of\r\nfodder for the cattle, and into this the prisoners huddled, finding\r\nsome shelter from the fury of the elements.\r\n\r\nFor hours the torrential rain persisted. All that time Bomba’s brain\r\nwas at work thinking out plans of escape, rejecting one, seizing on\r\nanother, and weighing the chances of all. The case was desperate, but\r\nhis spirit was indomitable.\r\n\r\nPresently he noted a change in the sound of the cataract. The rains had\r\nswelled it tremendously, and its roar had increased. But it was not\r\nthis that the jungle lad especially noted. It was a series of sharp\r\nreports, of splintering crashes, of jars that shook the earth, that\r\ncaused him to listen in wonder.\r\n\r\nThen he heard a loud screaming as of men and women in panic, a rushing\r\nof many feet and hoarse shouts that sent the guards scurrying from\r\ntheir posts in terror.\r\n\r\n“The rocks of the falls are breaking! The cataract is coming down on\r\nthe village! Run! Run! Run!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nA MAD STAMPEDE\r\n\r\n\r\nBomba was on his feet instantly, his mind working with precision and\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nHe sensed in a moment the full meaning of the calamity and the\r\nadvantages that he and the other captives might reap from it.\r\n\r\nThe enormous bulk of water that had swelled the volume of the cataract\r\nfrom the rain had broken the rocks that formed its brink. These had\r\ngiven way so that the course of the cataract had changed, and part of\r\nthe water that had previously fallen into the gorge was now sweeping\r\ndown on the doomed village.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with his promise, Hondura had severed the boy’s bonds so\r\nthat only a single strand was left. This he snapped like thread.\r\n\r\nThe guards had gone, forgetting all about the prisoners in the wild\r\ninstinct of self-preservation. They had joined the rabble that were\r\nnow rushing from their huts and through the passageways between, only\r\nintent for the moment on getting away from the waters that threatened\r\nto overwhelm them.\r\n\r\nBomba called Hondura and Pipina to his side.\r\n\r\n“The gods have been good to us,” he cried. “We must go now and go\r\nquickly. They will not think of us until their fright is over. Hondura,\r\nget your people and lead them out. Pipina, take care of Casson. I will\r\ntake Pirah--carry her if necessary--and go in front. Keep close to me.”\r\n\r\nIn a twinkling his orders were carried out. The prisoners, stirred to\r\nnew life by this unexpected chance of escape after all hope had been\r\nlost, responded to the call of their chief, hurried out of the stockade\r\nand mingled with the frantic, fleeing headhunters.\r\n\r\nNot the slightest notice was taken of them by their captors. The night\r\nwas very dark, and in their excitement it was impossible for the\r\nheadhunters to distinguish friend from foe. All thought was lost save\r\nthat of getting away from the doom that threatened them.\r\n\r\nBomba’s marvelous sense of direction stood him in good stead. Dark as\r\nit was, he knew exactly the way he meant to go.\r\n\r\nLuckily it was not the way in which the majority of the panic-stricken\r\npeople had chosen. They were pressing toward the north. Bomba’s plan\r\nwas to go toward the south, retracing the path they had followed that\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nThis had a double advantage. With every step he would be widening the\r\ndistance between the prisoners and their captors. If he could once win\r\nclear of the crowd, he and his companions would have a whole night’s\r\nstart in case of pursuit.\r\n\r\nThen, too, he felt sure that by this time the people of Hondura’s\r\ntribe, with what auxiliaries they could have mustered, had set out\r\nto rescue their chief. At any time now they might be met coming, and\r\ncoming in such force that they would have a good chance for victory, if\r\nit came to a fight with the headhunters.\r\n\r\nBomba hurried on in the lead, protecting and shielding little Pirah in\r\nevery way he could. Pipina and Casson were close behind, and the rest\r\nof the prisoners, led by Hondura, followed at their heels.\r\n\r\nThe party of captives had almost reached the end of the straggling\r\nvillage when a huge figure loomed up before them. He was hastening in a\r\ndirection opposite to them, but not at such a headlong pace, as though\r\nhe had a certain dignity to maintain which forbade too much yielding to\r\nfright.\r\n\r\nBomba could not see his face, but he knew that there was but one such\r\ntowering figure in the tribe. It was Nascanora!\r\n\r\nBomba handed over Pirah to Hondura. Then he felt for his knife.\r\n\r\nHe still kept up his pace, hoping to pass the chief without being\r\nnoticed. But there was something in his stride or form that aroused the\r\nchief’s suspicions.\r\n\r\n“Stop!” he commanded, barring the way and stooping down to peer into\r\nthe boy’s face.\r\n\r\nBomba had pulled out his knife from its hiding place by the blade. He\r\nhad no time to grasp the hilt, but with all the power in his muscular\r\narm he swung the heavy weapon, and the iron haft struck Nascanora right\r\nbetween the eyes. The giant chief went down as though he had been hit\r\nby an axe.\r\n\r\nLike a flash, Bomba dragged him out of the road and threw him into the\r\nbushes at the side.\r\n\r\n“Better make sure with the point of the knife,” suggested Hondura.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bomba, “I will not kill a man who cannot fight. He will not\r\nwake till morning, and then we shall be far from here.”\r\n\r\nHis hopes were higher now as he pressed on. His one fear had been that\r\nNascanora might rally his people and pursue his former prisoners. That\r\nfear now had vanished. Without their chief the headhunters would be\r\nconfused and bewildered, and, not knowing what to do, would probably do\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nBut now another enemy threatened. The waters of the cataract that had\r\nalready wiped out most of the village were expanding into the open\r\ncountry. Already it was lapping at the fugitives’ heels, as though\r\ndetermined to draw them back and overwhelm them. It retarded their\r\nprogress. Their feet stuck in the clammy ooze. The water kept rising\r\nhigher and higher. It reached their ankles. It reached their knees. It\r\nseemed as though it were destined to conquer.\r\n\r\nThen, just when it seemed that hope must be abandoned, an inspiriting\r\ncry came from Bomba.\r\n\r\n“The road is leading upward!” he shouted. “We are coming to a hill! The\r\nwaters shall not have us!”\r\n\r\nThere was a jubilant chorus of shouts as the party struck the incline,\r\nand in a few minutes they were on ground above the swirling waters of\r\nthe mighty river. The Giant Cataract had reached out for them, but they\r\nhad eluded its grasp!\r\n\r\nIt was an exhausted but happy throng of refugees that sank down upon\r\nthe slope as soon as they had reached a safe distance.\r\n\r\nTheir situation had changed as though by the waving of a magician’s\r\nwand. Two hours before they had been helpless victims in the hands of\r\nthe headhunters, doomed to torture and to death. Now their enemies\r\nwere scattered, demoralized, fleeing for their lives from an enemy as\r\npitiless as themselves.\r\n\r\nThe rain had ceased now, and the traveling promised to be easier.\r\nBomba gave them a little time to rest, and then the journey was resumed.\r\n\r\nThe lake that now extended between them and their enemies was another\r\nelement in their favor. It would be some time before the waters would\r\nsubside so as to make pursuit possible.\r\n\r\nAll through the night the little party pressed on, and not until the\r\nfirst glimmer of dawn appeared in the eastern sky did they stop to make\r\ncamp and obtain a much needed rest on the banks of the River of Death.\r\n\r\nWhile the Indians scurried around in the forest to find jaboty eggs,\r\nnuts, and fruit for the morning meal, Bomba climbed a great tree on the\r\nbank of the river to look back on the trail they had traversed.\r\n\r\nFrom the top he could see for many miles. His keen eyes scanned the\r\nhorizon, but could detect no traces of pursuers.\r\n\r\nWith his heart temporarily at rest, he was about to descend when he\r\nbecame conscious of a swaying, rocking motion of the tree. At the same\r\nmoment a shout came from below:\r\n\r\n“The tree is falling! Come down! Quick!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nIN THE SWIRL OF THE RAPIDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe warning to Bomba came too late.\r\n\r\nThe tree had been undermined by the current, swelled by the recent\r\nrain. It had probably been tottering to its fall when Bomba climbed it,\r\nand his weight and his movements among the branches determined its fate.\r\n\r\nBomba was too high to jump. From such a distance he would surely have\r\nbroken a limb and possibly his neck. He could only cling tightly to the\r\nbough on which he found himself and trust to chance.\r\n\r\nSlowly the tree toppled, and then, with a tremendous splash, fell into\r\nthe river. Its momentum carried it for a moment beneath the surface.\r\nThen it came up again with Bomba, drenched and sputtering, still\r\nholding tightly to the bough.\r\n\r\nFortunately he had been on the landward side of the tree, so that he\r\nwas on the upper side as the tree swirled in the current.\r\n\r\nNow, as his eyes cleared, he found that he was not alone. Ashati and\r\nNeram had been standing at the foot of the tree, and as its great\r\nroots tore loose from the ground they caught the two ex-slaves and\r\nflung them with the force of a catapult far out into the stream.\r\n\r\nThey had made for the tree as the nearest haven of safety, and now\r\nclimbed up into the branches and drew as near as they could to Bomba.\r\n\r\nThe lad’s first impulse, when he found himself afloat, was to plunge\r\ninto the river and swim for the bank, two hundred feet away. But even\r\nas the thought came into his mind he caught sight of the scaly body and\r\nhorrid head of an alligator between him and the shore. The brute would\r\nhave had him before he had gone twenty feet.\r\n\r\nBy this time the tree had been caught in the rapids, those terrible\r\nrapids of the River of Death whose power Bomba had already tested.\r\n\r\nHad it been merely the trunk of a tree on which they found themselves,\r\nthey would have been tossed off in a moment. But the great spreading\r\nbranches kept it from turning over. Even at that, it was tossed about\r\nlike a chip, and great waves broke over it, threatening at any moment\r\nto dislodge Bomba and his two companions, who had to hold on with all\r\ntheir might to prevent being swept away.\r\n\r\nThe horror of their position was intensified by the presence of a swarm\r\nof alligators, whose eyes had detected them and looked upon them as\r\ncertain prey. The monsters swam about the tree on every side, at times\r\ndashing up from underneath with wide open jaws, in the hope of reaching\r\nthem and pulling them down.\r\n\r\nAshati and Neram thought that their last hour had come, and Bomba was\r\ninclined to agree with them. The tree might stay there, buffeted back\r\nand forth, for days. They could not guide it. They dared not leave it.\r\n\r\nFrom the contemplation of his own plight, his thoughts turned to those\r\non shore. He was thankful that they were safe for the moment. Hondura\r\nwas there to lead them, and the wily chief knew all the lore and\r\ncraft of the jungle. With the start he had over his enemies and the\r\nprobability that he would soon fall in with his own warriors coming to\r\nhis rescue, Hondura would probably win through.\r\n\r\nAnd Bomba knew that the old chief and his people would take good care\r\nof Casson. Good old Casson! Would he ever see the old man again, the\r\nlad wondered.\r\n\r\nBut a different and more welcome turn was given to his thoughts when\r\nBomba discovered that the fierce tossing had ceased. The tree had been\r\nthrown from the rapids into smoother water, and was now drifting in the\r\ngrip of a strong current in the same direction that Bomba’s canoe had\r\ntaken two days before.\r\n\r\nIn a little while the point of land resembling a finger had been\r\nreached and passed, at so little distance that it would have been easy\r\nto swim to it, had it not been for the monster caymen that still kept\r\npace with them.\r\n\r\nAshati and Neram had recovered their spirits, now that they had escaped\r\nthe grip of the rapids.\r\n\r\n“The Spirit of the Jungle is good!” exclaimed Ashati.\r\n\r\n“It will not be long before we touch land somewhere,” prophesied Neram,\r\nhopefully.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bomba, as his eyes caught sight of Sobrinini’s domain\r\nlooming up before them, “and the land will be Snake Island.”\r\n\r\nAt this name of ominous import a shudder ran through Bomba’s companions.\r\n\r\n“The island of the witch woman!” exclaimed Ashati, making cabalistic\r\nsigns to ward off evil.\r\n\r\n“The woman with the evil eye which brings death to everyone on whom it\r\nfalls!” said Neram with a shiver.\r\n\r\n“Listen!” said Bomba. “You talk like foolish men. Is Bomba dead? Yet\r\nSobrinini’s look fell upon Bomba. She is a wise woman. Did she not say\r\nthat I would come back to Snake Island? And is Bomba not going back? I\r\ndo not like her snakes. But she has done no evil to Bomba, and she will\r\ndo no hurt to Bomba’s friends. And Ashati and Neram are my friends.”\r\n\r\nThe boy’s words brought some reassurance to his companions, but not\r\nenough to banish their fears wholly, and it was with great trepidation\r\nthat they viewed the dreaded island as the tree drew ever nearer.\r\n\r\nAs for Bomba himself, he was almost glad at the accident which had at\r\nthe time seemed so disastrous. He would not of his own accord have\r\ntaken the time just now to visit Sobrinini again, eager as he was to\r\nrenew his questioning. She had been on the very point of telling him\r\nwhat he wanted to know when Nascanora and his braves had broken in upon\r\nthem. Perhaps this time he would be more fortunate.\r\n\r\nHe was immersed in these thoughts when to their ears came a wailing\r\ncry, so weird, so uncanny, so long drawn out, that it chilled their\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nIt came from the direction of the island, but, strain their eyes as\r\nthey might, they could detect no human figure from whom the cry might\r\nhave issued.\r\n\r\nThe sound was the signal for another outbreak of fear on the part of\r\nthe ex-slaves. They were brave enough when facing human or animal foes,\r\nas they had shown in their combat with the jaguars, but when brought in\r\ncontact with what they regarded as supernatural, their hearts melted\r\nwithin them.\r\n\r\nThey whimpered and cowered and glanced at the water, as though they\r\nwere almost willing to take their chances with the alligators rather\r\nthan approach the island they deemed accursed.\r\n\r\nBut they had drawn nearer now and they could detect an agitated,\r\ntumultuous group of figures on the shore.\r\n\r\nThe wailing cry came again, so near this time that Ashati and Neram\r\nnearly lost their grip on the boughs.\r\n\r\nThen from out the fringe of trees that lined the shore shot a small\r\ncanoe, paddled with frantic energy by a withered old woman, her\r\nstraggling locks streaming behind her head, her face convulsed with\r\nfear.\r\n\r\n“Sobrinini!” cried Bomba.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE RESCUE OF SOBRININI\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Bomba, to think was to act.\r\n\r\nIn a moment he had made his way out on the bough to a point where the\r\nfoliage thinned out and there was a chance of his being seen.\r\n\r\n“Sobrinini! Sobrinini!” he shouted at the top of his voice.\r\n\r\nAt the call, the old crone ceased paddling for a moment and turned her\r\nhaggard face in the direction of the tree.\r\n\r\n“Who calls?” she cried shrilly. “Who is it that calls Sobrinini?”\r\n\r\n“It is Bomba!” shouted the lad, at the same time shaking the bough of\r\nthe tree violently to attract her attention.\r\n\r\nShe caught the movement of the foliage, and, peering closely, saw the\r\noutline of Bomba’s face and form.\r\n\r\n“Bartow!” she cried. “Or is it Bartow’s ghost? You have come to see\r\nSobrinini die.”\r\n\r\n“No!” replied Bomba. “I have come to help Sobrinini live. Come\r\nquickly!”\r\n\r\nThis last admonition was prompted by the sight of another boat\r\ncontaining several natives of the island putting out from the shore. He\r\nsensed at once that their errand was hostile.\r\n\r\nSobrinini saw them too, and with a few strokes of her paddle brought\r\nthe canoe directly beneath the jungle boy.\r\n\r\nBomba dropped lightly into the canoe, and then held it steady until\r\nAshati and Neram had time to follow his example.\r\n\r\nThe other boat was coming on rapidly now, and time was pressing. Bomba\r\ntook the paddle from Sobrinini’s hands and pressed her gently to the\r\nbottom of the boat.\r\n\r\nBut before he dipped the paddle into the water he drew his knife and\r\nshook it menacingly at the approaching natives.\r\n\r\n“Go back or you will die!” he shouted. “This is the knife that\r\nfrightened Nascanora. It made his heart like that of a woman. Who are\r\nyou to stand before it when even the chief of the headhunters was\r\nafraid?”\r\n\r\nIt was a wholesome reminder, and it had an immediate effect. They\r\nrecognized Bomba now as the jungle boy whose challenge Nascanora had\r\nbeen afraid to accept. That scene had made an indelible impression upon\r\ntheir minds. They stopped paddling, and excited jabbering ensued.\r\n\r\nBomba faced them for a full minute. Then with a disdainful gesture\r\nhe replaced the knife in his belt, as though they were foes too\r\ninsignificant to bother with any further, took up the paddle, and\r\nwithout once looking behind him made for the opposite shore.\r\n\r\nHis evident fearlessness and contempt decided the issue. The pursuing\r\nparty, after a little irresolution, gave up the chase and turned the\r\nprow of their boat in the direction of Snake Island.\r\n\r\nSobrinini had said nothing coherent since her rescue, but sat crouched\r\non the bottom of the boat mumbling to herself, her long, disheveled\r\nhair shielding her face. Bomba regarded her curiously from time to\r\ntime, half expecting to see one or more snakes make their appearance.\r\nBut it soon became apparent that all her horrid “pets” had been left\r\nbehind in her hurried flight.\r\n\r\nAshati and Neram kept as far away from her as they could, crowding\r\nagainst each other to avoid contact with the “witch” whose name spread\r\nterror through all that region.\r\n\r\nWhy had she fled from the island where she had so long held sway? Why\r\nhad her formerly submissive slaves turned against her? Bomba longed to\r\nquestion her, but had to defer that to another time. He wished that she\r\nhad brought with her that picture, the picture of that sweet, beautiful\r\nwoman, whose eyes had looked so fondly into his.\r\n\r\nAfter a long siege of paddling, the boat touched the farther shore.\r\nBomba jumped out and pulled the canoe far up on the shelving bank. Then\r\nhe helped Sobrinini out, while Ashati and Neram leaped ashore quickly,\r\nglad to be freed from their enforced proximity to the witch.\r\n\r\nAt Bomba’s command, the men scattered to gather a little food from\r\nthe forest, and soon returned with nuts and berries that partially\r\nsatisfied their hunger.\r\n\r\nBidding them stay where they were, Bomba penetrated some distance into\r\nthe jungle to see if he could pick up the trail of Hondura and his\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone far before he began to sniff. He smelled smoke. His\r\neyes followed the indications of his nostrils, and he finally caught\r\nsight of a shred of smoke rising above trees not far distant.\r\n\r\nHe was about to drop on his hands and knees and creep through the brush\r\nto reconnoiter, when he heard a sound that made his heart leap with\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nIt came to him faintly, and yet was unmistakable. Somebody was playing\r\na harmonica!\r\n\r\nReassured now, but still not abandoning his habitual caution, he moved\r\nforward until from the shelter of a bush he could see encamped in a\r\nclearing, while they prepared their midday meal, a large party of\r\nnatives, evidently on the warpath, as they were armed to the teeth.\r\n\r\nHe knew them at once. They were the Araos coming to the rescue of their\r\nchief. There was Lodo, evidently in command, a little apart from the\r\nrest. And there was Grico, squatting on his haunches and bringing weird\r\nsounds from Bomba’s harmonica for the delectation of his mates.\r\n\r\nBomba stepped from the shelter of the bush, his hands upraised with\r\npalms outward in sign of friendship.\r\n\r\nThere was a chorus of ejaculations, a hurried grasping of weapons, and\r\nthen shouts of pleasure as they recognized the newcomer.\r\n\r\nThey crowded about him with every manifestation of delight,\r\noverwhelming him with questions. And cries of joy went up as Bomba, in\r\nas few words as possible, told them what had happened and that Hondura\r\nwith the ex-captives must be close at hand and coming to meet them.\r\n\r\nInstantly their meal was forgotten as they gathered up their weapons\r\nand supplies and prepared to go forward to greet their chief, their\r\nwomen, and their children.\r\n\r\nGrico, the man with the one eye and the split nose, had listened to\r\nBomba’s story with such absorbed interest that he still held the\r\nharmonica loosely in his hand. Bomba reached out coolly and took it\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nGrico looked astonished and sheepish. And he was still more abashed\r\nwhen Bomba, noting a protuberance in Grico’s pouch, reached in and drew\r\nout the precious revolver.\r\n\r\n“It was good of Grico to keep these for Bomba till he should come back\r\nagain,” said the boy in the friendliest of tones, as he stowed away the\r\ntreasures in his pouch.\r\n\r\nHis look was so kindly, so innocent, that Grico did not know what to do\r\nor say. Ordinarily this would have meant a fight. But Grico knew that\r\nBomba was a bad opponent to pick for a fight, and, besides, at this\r\nmoment, the boy was high in the favor of the tribe.\r\n\r\nAnd Bomba’s eyes were very compelling, despite their friendliness.\r\nGrico had never heard of an iron hand in a velvet glove, but he felt\r\nthat something of that kind was very close by.\r\n\r\nSo he swallowed hard for a moment, and then took advantage of the\r\nopening that Bomba had given him.\r\n\r\n“Y--yes,” he stammered. “Grico found them in the jungle and kept them\r\nfor Bomba.”\r\n\r\n“Grico did well, and Bomba will not forget,” said the lad gravely.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged hastily that Bomba should go back and get his\r\ncompanions and then join the war party as they went forward to meet\r\ntheir chief.\r\n\r\nAshati and Neram greeted Bomba’s news with cries of delight. Sobrinini\r\nshowed no emotion whatever. It was doubtful whether she understood.\r\nShe was sunk in a state of apathy, the natural reaction from her\r\nexciting experiences.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to get her to her feet at all, but the need was urgent\r\nand Bomba put his strong arm under hers, and with Ashati and Neram made\r\nas good time as possible in the direction of the line of march.\r\n\r\nLuckily, their journey was not prolonged, for before an hour had passed\r\na joyous hubbub not far ahead told them that the two parties had joined\r\nforces. Hondura and the ex-prisoners were once more with their own\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nBomba was welcomed with wild acclaim when he came into view. Casson and\r\nPipina especially greeted him with tears and embraces that testified\r\nhow deeply they were moved.\r\n\r\nThere was a great feast to celebrate the reunion, followed by a long\r\npowwow between Hondura, Grico and Lodo. Bomba was invited to join the\r\nconference, but declined, as he felt this was a matter that concerned\r\nthem chiefly and he did not want to take any responsibility for the\r\nfuture movements of the tribe.\r\n\r\nThe result of the powwow was that the natives formed themselves into\r\ntwo bands. One, consisting of picked warriors under the leadership of\r\nLodo, with Grico as his lieutenant, proceeded toward the Giant Cataract\r\nto give battle to the headhunters and remove forever, if possible,\r\nthat menace to the peaceful tribes of the region.\r\n\r\nOthers, under the guidance of the aged chief, Hondura, convoyed the\r\nrescued women and children in the direction of their maloca, which they\r\nplanned to rebuild.\r\n\r\nThe grateful Hondura detailed eight of his men to make two litters on\r\nwhich they bore Casson and Sobrinini, who had reached the limit of\r\ntheir strength, to the cabin of Pipina.\r\n\r\nWhen their paths at last diverged, Hondura and Bomba clasped each other\r\nby the shoulders and vowed eternal friendship. Pirah wept bitterly at\r\nthe separation, and could only be comforted by Bomba’s promise to come\r\nto see her before long.\r\n\r\nBomba had cherished a vague hope that something dramatic would take\r\nplace when Casson and Sobrinini were brought face to face. He hoped the\r\nmeeting would unlock the floodgates of memories which they shared in\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nBut to his bitter disappointment nothing of the kind occurred. Age had\r\nchanged each so utterly that neither recognized the other. They looked\r\nat each other indifferently, and then their eyes turned away.\r\n\r\nHe had not named either one to the other as yet, and both were so\r\napathetic that they showed no curiosity. But though disheartened,\r\nBomba did not wholly despair. When they should get to the cabin of\r\nPipina he would try again.\r\n\r\nAshati and Neram had begged to be allowed to go along with Bomba, and\r\nhe had willingly agreed. The faithful fellows were devoted to him heart\r\nand soul, and they might be of great service to him whenever he should\r\nbe compelled to absent himself from the cabin.\r\n\r\nShred by shred, in monosyllables and muttered exclamations, Bomba\r\ngathered, as he walked beside Sobrinini’s litter, the reason for her\r\nflight from the island. He had already guessed it pretty accurately.\r\n\r\nHer harsh rule had for a long time galled the natives, who sought\r\nan excuse for rebellion. That excuse had been found in the visit of\r\nNascanora. They had expected that she would annihilate him on the spot.\r\nWas she not a witch? But when, on the contrary, Nascanora had triumphed\r\nand taken her guest from under her protection, their belief in her\r\nsupernatural powers failed, their long-smothered resentment broke\r\nforth, and she had been compelled to flee for her life.\r\n\r\nThe little party reached the cabin of Pipina without any untoward\r\nhappening, the braves departed for their maloca, and the little\r\nhousehold, now increased by three, was reëstablished.\r\n\r\nBomba waited till several days had elapsed and his aged charges had\r\nbecome rested and strengthened after their exhausting experiences\r\nbefore he broached the subject that was nearest his heart.\r\n\r\nThen, one evening after supper, he turned to them as they were sitting\r\ndreamily in the large room of the little cabin.\r\n\r\n“Casson!” he said. “Sobrinini! Look upon each other and tell me what\r\nyou see.”\r\n\r\nThey started at his sharp command, and gazed bewilderedly at him, then\r\nat each other.\r\n\r\nAt first there was no recognition, but as they gazed fixedly a dawning\r\nwonderment came into their eyes.\r\n\r\nCasson was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n“Sobrinini!” he cried. “No, that is not Sobrinini. Sobrinini was\r\nbeautiful. Sobrinini could sing. And yet--and yet----”\r\n\r\n“Casson!” exclaimed Sobrinini in her turn. “It cannot be Casson. He was\r\nyoung and strong, and his hair was like that of the raven. But I am\r\nSobrinini. I can sing. Listen!”\r\n\r\nShe sprang to her feet and sang in her cracked voice the song that\r\nBomba had heard in the language he did not understand. As she sang,\r\nCasson began to beat his withered palms together in applause, and\r\nfinally got to his feet and started to dance about the room.\r\n\r\nIt was weird and uncanny, and Bomba looked on, fascinated yet\r\nhorrified, until the song ended, the dance stopped, and the aged\r\nparticipants sank trembling in their chairs.\r\n\r\n“You do know each other!” cried Bomba. “And you know about my father\r\nand my mother. Tell me, oh, tell me who they were, where they are! Tell\r\nme!”\r\n\r\nThey looked at him, trying to gather their poor scattered wits. Casson\r\nrubbed his forehead with his hand.\r\n\r\n“Ask Jojasta,” he muttered. “I cannot remember. The door is closed. But\r\nJojasta knows. Ask him.”\r\n\r\n“But Jojasta is dead!” exclaimed Bomba.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” replied Casson. “You told me he was dead. Then ask\r\nSobrinini. Nini will know.”\r\n\r\nIn desperation, Bomba turned to the woman.\r\n\r\n“You tell me,” he begged. “You were going to tell me when Nascanora\r\ncame. Tell me now!”\r\n\r\n“I forget--I forget,” murmured Sobrinini. “I cannot tell you, Bartow.”\r\n\r\n“I am not Bartow,” said Bomba.\r\n\r\n“Then you are his ghost,” muttered the crone.\r\n\r\n“No, no!” cried Bomba. “Look at me. Try to remember.”\r\n\r\nShe stared at him long and hard.\r\n\r\n“If you are not Bartow nor Bartow’s ghost, you are his son,” she\r\ndeclared. “Andrew Bartow and Laura--yes, her name was Laura--had a son\r\nwho was named Bonny. She used to sing to him like this--” and again\r\nshe crooned the tender cradle song that had stirred Bomba so strangely.\r\n\r\nShe relapsed into meditation, still humming that haunting song.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” prompted Bomba eagerly. “Where are Bartow and Laura now? And\r\nBonny----”\r\n\r\n“Bonny!” she repeated. “Oh, yes, Bonny was stolen. He was stolen from\r\nhome by--by--Japazy! That was his name--a half-breed. Japazy hated\r\nBartow and hated Casson, too. I do not know why he hated them. And\r\nthen--and then--oh, I cannot remember! But ask Japazy--he will know.\r\nLook for Japazy on Jaguar Island above the cataract.”\r\n\r\nHer voice died away in disjointed mutterings, and from neither her nor\r\nCasson could he get anything clearer that evening nor in the days that\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nThe boy was desperate. It seemed that the half-demented man and woman\r\ncould get no further. Bomba had got merely a clue.\r\n\r\nBut that in itself was something. How Bomba followed it up and what\r\nexciting perils and adventures he met in fulfilling his task will be\r\ntold in the next volume of this series, entitled: “Bomba the Jungle Boy\r\non Jaguar Island; or, Adrift on the River of Mystery.”\r\n\r\nFrom the pain and disappointment in his heart Bomba sought relief with\r\nhis wild friends of the forest. They could always sympathize with his\r\nmood and in some degree understand it. To them he talked, and they\r\nchattered in reply. And his sore heart was eased in their companionship.\r\n\r\nOne day, when he had been playing his harmonica and Doto, the monkey,\r\nand Kiki and Woowoo, the parrots, and others of their mates were\r\ngathered around him, there was a crashing in the bushes, and faithful\r\nPolulu, the giant puma, bounded into the clearing.\r\n\r\nThe others scattered like magic as the formidable beast came up to\r\nBomba, purring and rubbing his head against him.\r\n\r\n“Good old Polulu!” exclaimed Bomba, as he caressed the great head\r\naffectionately. “He is one of Bomba’s best friends. Bomba is glad to\r\nsee him. But Bomba cannot stay with Polulu long. He is going on a long\r\njourney. For Bomba’s place is not here. He is not a native of the\r\njungle. He has a soul. He is white. Yes, Bomba is white. And Bomba’s\r\nsoul cannot be at rest until he dwells among the white people.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOMBA BOOKS\r\n\r\nBy ROY ROCKWOOD\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_12mo. Cloth.

Behind all is the dread Wolf Cry which causes brave men to\r\n  shudder....\r\n\r\n\r\n4. THE SPELL OF THE NORTH\r\n\r\n  Sergeant David Stanlaw, stationed at Spirit River, is puzzled by a\r\n  local killing, the disappearance of the body, the finding of a code\r\n  message, and by the mystery of the “Listening Forest,” which casts a\r\n  shadow of dread over the little town of Wiggin’s Creek.

With the aid of his friend, Jim MacPhail, Wade frustrates the\r\n  outlaws, who try to trap the whole town behind the “Pass of the\r\n  Closing Door,” and then races them to and across the breaking ice\r\n  floes of the Yukon.
