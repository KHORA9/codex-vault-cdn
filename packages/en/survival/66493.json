THE NORTH OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\nThe volcanic intercalations which diversify the Lower Carboniferous\r\nformations of Southern Scotland extend but a short way across the\r\nEnglish Border, and although, over the moors and hills of the north of\r\nCumberland and Northumberland, the Carboniferous sandstones, limestones\r\nand shales are well exposed, they present no continuation of either the\r\nplateau or puy-eruptions which play so prominent a part in the geology\r\nof Roxburghshire and Dumfriesshire. This deficiency is all the more\r\nnoticeable seeing that the Carboniferous system is exposed down to its\r\nvery base, in the deep dales of the North of England. Had any truly\r\ninterstratified volcanic material existed in the system there, it could\r\nhardly fail to have been detected.\r\n\r\nBut while contemporaneous volcanic rocks are absent, the northern\r\nEnglish counties contain many intrusive masses of dolerite, diabase,\r\nandesite or other eruptive rocks, which may be found traversing all\r\nthe subdivisions of the Carboniferous system. These eruptive materials\r\nhave taken two forms: in some cases they rise as Dykes, in others they\r\nappear as Sills.\r\n\r\nDykes.--With regard to the dykes, some are probably much later than\r\nthe Carboniferous period, and consequently will be more appropriately\r\nconsidered in Chapters xxxiv. and xxxv. The great Cleveland dyke,\r\nfor example, which runs across the Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic\r\nand Jurassic formations, is probably referable to the Older Tertiary\r\nvolcanic period. One dyke known as the Hett Dyke, has been plausibly\r\nclaimed as possibly of Carboniferous age. It runs in a W.S.W. direction\r\nfrom the Magnesian Limestone escarpment at Quarrington Hill, a few\r\nmiles to the east of Durham, through the great Coal-field, across the\r\nMillstone Grit and Carboniferous Limestone, disappearing near Middleton\r\nin Teesdale. Its total length is thus about 23 miles. It varies in\r\nbreadth from about 6 to about 15 feet, and appears to increase in\r\ndimensions as it goes westward.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Sedgwick, _Trans. Geol. Soc._ 2nd series, iii. part 1\r\n(1826-28), p. 63; _Trans. Cambridge Phil. Soc._ ii. (1822), p. 21. Sir\r\nJ. Lowthian Bell, _Proc. Roy. Soc._ xxiii. (1875), p. 543.]\r\n\r\nThe age of this dyke cannot at present be satisfactorily fixed.\r\nIt must be later than the Coal-measures through which it rises.\r\nSedgwick long ago pointed out that though it reaches the escarpment\r\nof the Magnesian Limestone, it does not cut it; yet it is found in\r\ncoal-mining to traverse the Coal-measures underlying the Limestone. He\r\nwas accordingly inclined to believe it to be of older date than the\r\nMagnesian Limestone. At its western extremity it approaches close to\r\nthe Great Whin Sill of Teesdale, though no absolute connection between\r\nthe two has been established. Mr. Teall, however, has called attention\r\nto the similarity between the microscopic structure of the rock forming\r\nthe Hett Dyke and that of the mass of the Whin Sill, and he is strongly\r\ninclined to regard them as belonging to the same period of intrusion.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xl. (1884), p. 230.]\r\n\r\nIt is especially worthy of remark that in the course of its nearly\r\nrectilinear course across the Durham Coal-field, the Hett Dyke, where\r\nit crosses the Wear, is flanked on the north at a distance of a little\r\nmore than two miles by a second parallel dyke of nearly identical\r\ncomposition. Between the two dykes, during mining operations, a sill\r\nabout 20 feet thick has been met with, lying between two well-known\r\ncoal-seams at a depth of about 60 fathoms from the surface, and\r\nextending over an area of at least 15 acres.[3] Microscopic examination\r\nof this sill by Mr. Teall proved that the rock presents the closest\r\nresemblance to that of the Hett Dyke.[4] In this case, it may be\r\nregarded as probable that the two dykes and the intermediate sill form\r\none related series of intrusions, and the conjecture that the Hett Dyke\r\nmay be connected with the Whin Sill thus receives corroboration. The\r\nage of the Whin Sill itself will be discussed a few pages further on.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Sir Lowthian Bell, _Proc. Roy. Soc._ xxiii. (1875), p.\r\n544.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xl. (1884), p. 230.]\r\n\r\nOf the other dykes which may possibly be coeval with the Hett Dyke we\r\nmay specially note those which follow the same W.S.W. trend, for that\r\nstrike differs from the general W.N.W. direction of most of the dykes.\r\nTwo conspicuous examples of the south-westerly trend may be seen,\r\none near Morpeth, the other north of Bellingham. The former dyke, as\r\nregards microscopic structure, is more nearly related to the majority\r\nof the series in the North of England. But that north of Bellingham\r\n(High Green) presents affinities both in structure and composition\r\nwith the Hett Dyke,[5] and may perhaps belong to the same period of\r\nintrusion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Mr. Teall, _op. cit._ p. 244. _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._\r\nxxxix. (1884), p. 656, and _Proc. Geol. Assoc._ (1886). See also Prof.\r\nLebour, _Geology of Northumberland and Durham_, chap. xi.]\r\n\r\nThe Great Whin Sill.--The geologist who, after making himself\r\nacquainted with the abundant sills among the Carboniferous rocks in the\r\ncentre of Scotland, finds his way into Northumberland, meets there with\r\ngeological features that have become familiar to him further north.\r\nThe sea-cliffs of Bamborough and Dunstanborough, the rocky islets of\r\nFarne, the long lines of brown crag and green slope that strike inland\r\nthrough the Kyloe Hills and wind across the cultivated lowlands and the\r\nmoorlands beyond, remind him at every turn of the scenery in the basin\r\nof the Forth. But not until he has traced these ridges for many miles\r\nsouthwards and found their component rocks to form there an almost\r\ncontinuous sheet does he realize that nothing of the kind among the\r\nScottish Carboniferous rocks can be compared for extent to this display\r\nin the North of England.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The Whin Sill has been the subject of much discussion,\r\nand a good deal of geological literature has been devoted to its\r\nconsideration. The writings of Trevelyan, Sedgwick, W. Hutton, Phillips\r\nand Tate are especially deserving of recognition. The intrusive\r\ncharacter of the Sill, maintained by some of these writers, was finally\r\nestablished by the mapping of the Geological Survey, and was discussed\r\nand illustrated by Messrs. W. Topley and G. A. Lebour in a paper in\r\nthe 33rd volume of the _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ (1877), in which\r\nreferences to the earlier observers will be found. See also Prof.\r\nLebour's _Outlines of the Geology of Northumberland_, 2nd edit. (1886),\r\np. 92. The petrography of the Whin Sill is fully treated by Mr. Teall\r\nin _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xl. (1884), p. 640, where a bibliography\r\nof the subject is also given.]\r\n\r\nFrom the furthest skerries of the Farne Islands southwards to Burton\r\nFell on the great Pennine escarpment, a distance in a straight line of\r\nabout 80 miles, this intrusive sheet may be traced in the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone series (Map I.). There are intervals where its continuity\r\ncannot be actually followed at the surface, but that it really runs\r\nunbroken from one end to the other underground cannot be doubted by any\r\none who has examined the region. This singular feature in the geology\r\nand scenery of the North of England is known locally as the Great\r\nWhin Sill.[7] From the rocky islets and castle-crowned crags of the\r\ncoast-line it maintains its characteristic topography, structure and\r\ncomposition throughout its long course in the interior. So regularly\r\nparallel with the sedimentary strata does it appear to lie, that it was\r\nformerly regarded by many observers as a true lava-sheet, poured out\r\nupon the sea-floor over which the limestones and shales were laid down.\r\nBut its really intrusive character has now been clearly demonstrated.\r\nNot a vestige of any tuff has been detected associated with it, nor\r\ndoes it ever present the usual characters of a true lava-stream.[8] Its\r\ninternal structure and the wonderful uniformity in its character mark\r\nit out as a typical intrusive sheet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: \"Whin\" is a common term in Scotland and the North of\r\nEngland for any hard kind of stone, especially such as can be used for\r\nmaking and mending roads. \"Sill\" denotes a flat course or bed of stone,\r\nand was evidently applied to this intrusive sheet from its persistent\r\nflat-bedded position and its prominence among the other gently inclined\r\nstrata among which it lies. It is from this example in the North of\r\nEngland that the word \"sill\" has passed into geological literature.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: On the coast at Bamborough and the Harkess Rocks the\r\nusual petrographical characters of the Whin Sill are exchanged for\r\nthose of fine-grained amygdaloidal diabases arranged in distinct\r\nsheets, which in their upper parts are highly vesicular and show ropy\r\nsurfaces--peculiarities suggestive of true lava-streams. But according\r\nto Professor Lebour the rocks are intrusive into limestone and shale\r\n(_Geology of Northumberland and Durham_, p. 98). Mr. Teall has\r\nexpressed the suspicion that these rocks must have consolidated under\r\nconditions somewhat different from those which characterized the normal\r\nWhin Sill (_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xl. p. 643). They seem to be\r\nthe only parts of the sill which present features that might possibly\r\nindicate superficial outflow.]\r\n\r\nAmong the manifestations of the subterranean intrusion of igneous rocks\r\nin the British Isles the Great Whin Sill, next after the Dalradian\r\nsills of Scotland, is the most extensive. Its striking continuity for\r\nso great a distance, and the absence around it of any other trace of\r\nigneous action, save a few dykes, place it in marked contrast to the\r\nordinary type of Carboniferous sills. The occasional gaps on its line\r\nof outcrop in the northern part of its course do not really affect\r\nour impression of the persistence of the sheet. They not improbably\r\nindicate merely that in its protrusion it had a wavy irregular limit,\r\nwhich in the progress of denudation has occasionally been not yet\r\nreached. For mile after mile the sill has been mapped by the Geological\r\nSurvey in lines of crag across the moorlands, and as a conspicuous\r\nband among the limestones and shales that form the steep front of the\r\nPennine escarpment, where it has long been known in the fine sections\r\nexposed among the gullies by which that noble rock-face has been\r\nfurrowed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 176.--Section from the great Limestone escarpment\r\non the west to the Millstone Grit hills east of Teesdale.\r\n\r\n1. Silurian strata; 2. Carboniferous Limestone series; 3. The Great\r\nWhin Sill, which gradually rises to higher stratigraphical position as\r\nit goes westward; 4. Millstone Grit.]\r\n\r\nAlong its main outcrop, the sill dips gently eastwards below the\r\nportion of the Carboniferous Limestone series which overlies it. But\r\nso slight are the inclinations, so gentle the undulations of the rocks\r\nin this part of the country, that far to the east of that outcrop\r\nthe sill has been laid bare by the streams which in the larger dales\r\nhave cut their way through the overlying cake of Carboniferous strata\r\ndown to the Silurian platform on which they rest (Fig. 176). Among\r\nthese inland revelations of the eastward continuation of the sill\r\nunder Carboniferous Limestone strata, the most striking and best known\r\nare those which have been made by the River Tees, and of which the\r\nfamous waterfalls of the High Force and Cauldron Snout are the most\r\npicturesque features. The distance of the remotest of these denuded\r\noutcrops or \"inliers\" from the main escarpment is not less than 20\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to form an accurate estimate of the total\r\nunderground area of the Whin Sill. In the southern half of the\r\ndistrict, south of the line of the Roman Wall, where, the inclination\r\nof the strata being generally low, the same stratigraphical horizons\r\nare exposed by denudation far to the east of the main outcrops of\r\nthe rocks, we know that the sill must have a subterranean extent of\r\nmore than 400 square miles. Yet this is probably only a small part of\r\nthe total area over which the molten material was injected. In the\r\nnorthern part of the district, the Carboniferous Limestone series is\r\nnot exposed over so broad a stretch of country, and denudation has not\r\nthere revealed the eastward extension of the sill. But there is no\r\nreason to suppose the sheet to be less continuous and massive there.\r\nWe must remember also that the present escarpment has been produced\r\nby denudation, and that the intrusive sheet must have once extended\r\nwestwards beyond its present limits at the surface. If, therefore, we\r\nwere to state broadly that the Great Whin Sill has been intruded into\r\nthe Carboniferous Limestone series over an area of 1000 square miles\r\nwe should probably be still below the truth.\r\n\r\nThe rock composing this vast intrusive sheet is a dolerite or diabase,\r\nwhich maintains throughout its wide extent a remarkable uniformity of\r\npetrographical characters. In this and other respects it illustrates\r\nthe typical features of sills. Thus it is coarsest in texture where\r\nit is thickest, and somewhat finer in grain towards its upper and\r\nlower surfaces than in the centre. Among the coarser varieties the\r\ncomponent crystals of augite are not infrequently an inch in length and\r\noccur in irregular patches.[9] Occasional amygdaloidal portions are\r\nobservable, but these are not more marked than those to be found in\r\nthe \"whin-dykes\" of the same region.[10] The amygdaloidal and vesicular\r\nfine-grained rocks of the Bamborough district may possibly be quite\r\ndistinct from the main body of the Whin Sill.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Sedgwick, _Cambridge Phil. Trans._ ii. p. 166. Mr. Teall,\r\n_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xl. p. 643.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Messrs. Topley and Lebour, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._\r\nxxxiii. p. 418.]\r\n\r\nUnder the microscope the rock is seen to consist essentially of the\r\nusual minerals--plagioclase, augite and titaniferous magnetic iron-ore.\r\nAn ophitic intergrowth of the augite and felspar is observable,\r\nlikewise a certain quantity of micropegmatite which plays the part of\r\ngroundmass between the interstices of the lath-shaped felspars. Full\r\ndetails of the characteristics of the component minerals and their\r\narrangement are given by Mr. Teall in the paper already cited.\r\n\r\nThe main body of the sill is a sheet which sometimes diminishes to\r\nless than 20 feet in thickness and sometimes expands to 150 feet,\r\nbut averages from 80 to 100 feet. It occasionally divides, as near\r\nGreat Bavington, where it appears at the surface in two distinct\r\nbeds separated by an intervening group of limestones and shales.\r\nOccasionally, as at Elf's Hill Quarry, it gives out branches which send\r\nstrings into the adjacent limestone.[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Messrs. Topley and Lebour, _op. cit._ p. 413.]\r\n\r\nAlthough in most natural sections it seems to lie quite parallel with\r\nthe strata above and below, yet a number of examples of its actual\r\nintrusion have been observed. When traced across the country, it is\r\nfound not to remain on a definite horizon, but to pass transgressively\r\nacross considerable thicknesses of strata. Its variations in this\r\nrespect are well shown in the accompanying table of comparative\r\nsections constructed by Messrs. Topley and Lebour.[12] It will be\r\nseen that while at Harlow Hill the sill is found overlying the Great\r\nLimestone of Alston Moor, at Rugley, five miles off it lies about 1000\r\nfeet lower down, far below the position of the Tyne-bottom Limestone.\r\nStill farther north, however, the sill west of Holy Island is said to\r\nlie 800 feet above the Great Limestone and to come among the higher\r\nbeds of the Carboniferous Limestone series.[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Op. cit._ plate xviii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _Op. cit._ p. 414.]\r\n\r\nThe Whin Sill appears generally to thicken in an easterly or\r\nnorth-easterly direction. There are further indications that it was\r\nintruded from east to west. Thus, at Shepherd's Gap, on the Great Roman\r\nWall, the dolerite, coming evidently from an easterly quarter, has\r\nbroken up and thrust itself beneath a bed of limestone. Again, when the\r\nsill bifurcates the branches unite towards the east or north-east.[14]\r\nThe sill can be proved to thin away to the west from Teesdale to the\r\nPennine escarpment, and in Weardale the \"Little Whin Sill\" diminishes\r\nfrom 20 feet, till in three miles it disappears.[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Op. cit._ p. 415.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _Op. cit._ p. 419.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Walker & Bontall sc._\r\n\r\nFig. 177.--Sections of the Carboniferous Limestone series of\r\nNorthumberland showing the variations in the position of the Whin Sill.\r\nBy Messrs. Topley and Lebour.]\r\n\r\nThe strata in contact with the Whin Sill, both above and below, have\r\nbeen more or less altered. Sandstones have been least affected;\r\nshales have suffered most, passing into a kind of porcellanite, with\r\ndevelopment of garnet and other minerals.[16] Limestone often shows\r\nonly slight traces of change, though here and there it has become\r\ncrystalline.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Mr. Teall, _op. cit._ xxxix. (1884), p. 642, and authors\r\ncited by him.]\r\n\r\nNo trace of any boss or neck has been detected in the whole region\r\nwhich might be supposed to mark a funnel of ascent for the material of\r\nthe Whin Sill. The Hett Dyke and the High Green Dyke, already noticed,\r\nmay, however, have been possibly connected with the injection of this\r\ngreat intrusive sheet. No other visible mass of igneous rock in the\r\nregion has been even plausibly conjectured to indicate a point or line\r\nof emission for the sill.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly singular that in so wide a territory, where the whole\r\nsuccession of strata has been so admirably laid bare by denudation in\r\nthousands of natural sections, and where, moreover, much additional\r\ninformation has been obtained from lead-mining as to the nature of\r\nthe rocks below ground, not a single vestige of tuff, agglomerate or\r\ninterstratified lava has been up to the present time recorded, unless\r\nthe Harkess rocks already alluded to can be so regarded.\r\n\r\nJudging, however, from the analogy of the other districts of igneous\r\nrocks in Britain, we can hardly resist the conclusion that the Great\r\nWhin Sill is essentially a manifestation of volcanic action, that it\r\nwas connected with the uprise of basic lava in volcanic orifices, and\r\nthat the subterranean energy may quite probably have succeeded in\r\nreaching the surface and ejecting there both lavas and tuffs.\r\n\r\nIt appears to be certain that any vents which existed cannot have lain\r\nto the west of the present escarpment of the sill, for no trace of them\r\ncan be found there piercing the Carboniferous or older formations. They\r\nmust have lain somewhere to the east in the area now overspread with\r\nMillstone Grit and Coal-measures, or still farther east in the tract\r\nnow concealed under the North Sea. The evidence of the sill itself, as\r\nwe have seen, corroborates this view of the probable situation of the\r\ncentre of disturbance.\r\n\r\nThe question of the geological age of the sill is one of considerable\r\ndifficulty, to which no confident answer can be given.[17] The injection\r\nof the diabase must obviously be considerably later than the highest\r\nstrata through which it has risen; that is, it must be younger than\r\nsome of the higher members of the Carboniferous Limestone series. But\r\nhere our positive evidence fails.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: See Messrs. Topley and Lebour, _op. cit._ p. 418.]\r\n\r\nThe Sill is traversed by the same faults which disrupt the surrounding\r\nCarboniferous rocks. It is therefore of older date than these\r\ndislocations. Its striking general parallelism with the shales and\r\nlimestones probably proves that it was intruded before the rocks were\r\nmuch disturbed from their original horizontal position. But the manner\r\nin which the intrusive rock has been thrust into and has involved the\r\nshales and limestones seems to indicate that these strata had already\r\nbecome consolidated and lay under the pressure of a great thickness of\r\nsuperincumbent Carboniferous strata.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of all certainty on the subject it seems most natural\r\nto place the Whin Sill provisionally among the Carboniferous volcanic\r\nseries with which petrographically and structurally it has so much\r\nin common. In Scotland the puy-eruptions continued till the time of\r\nthe Coal-measures. If, before the close of the Carboniferous period,\r\nvolcanic vents were opened somewhere to the east of the coal-fields of\r\nNorthumberland and Durham, they might be accompanied with basic sills\r\ninjected into the Carboniferous Limestone series, which was then lying\r\nstill approximately horizontal under a thickness of from 3500 to 5000\r\nfeet of Carboniferous sedimentary deposits. These still undiscovered\r\nvolcanoes seem to have been endowed with even more energy than those\r\nof Central and Southern Scotland, at least nowhere else among the\r\nCarboniferous records of Britain is there such a colossal manifestation\r\nof subterranean intrusion as the Great Whin Sill.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE DERBYSHIRE TOADSTONES\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any certain evidence that the Whin Sill belongs to\r\nthe Carboniferous period, we must advance southward into the very heart\r\nof England before any clear vestiges can be found of contemporaneous\r\nvolcanic eruptions among the members of the Carboniferous system.\r\nAfter quitting the lavas and tuffs of Roxburghshire and their brief\r\ncontinuations across the English border, we do not again meet with any\r\ntruly bedded volcanic rocks in that system until we reach the middle\r\nof Derbyshire. In this picturesque district, famous for its lead-mines\r\nand its mineral waters, a feebly developed but interesting group of\r\nintercalated lavas, locally called \"toadstones,\" has long been known.\r\nThere is thus a space of some 150 miles across which, though the\r\nformations are there so fully developed and so abundantly trenched by\r\nvalleys from the top to the bottom of the system, no volcanic vents nor\r\nany trace of Carboniferous volcanic ejections has yet been found. On\r\nthe other hand, after the district of the \"toadstones\" is passed, the\r\nCarboniferous rocks are again destitute of any volcanic intercalations\r\nacross the centre and south-west of England and over Wales, until after\r\na space of about 150 miles they reappear in Somerset.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic group of Derbyshire thus stands out entirely isolated.\r\nLying in the Carboniferous Limestone, where that formation is typically\r\ndeveloped, it presents an admirable example of a thoroughly marine\r\nphase of volcanic action (Map I.).\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent features in the geology of the centre of\r\nEngland is the broad anticlinal fold which brings up the lower portion\r\nof the Carboniferous system to form the long ridge of the Pennine chain\r\nthat runs from Yorkshire to the Midland plain, and separates the\r\neastern from the western coal-fields. This fold widens southwards until\r\nnot only the Millstone Grit and Yoredale rocks, but the underlying\r\nMountain Limestone is laid bare. A broad limestone district is thus\r\nexposed in the very heart of the country, ranging as a green fertile\r\nundulating tableland, deeply cut by winding valleys, which expose\r\nadmirable sections of the strata, but nowhere reach the base of the\r\nsystem. The total visible depth of the limestone series is computed to\r\nbe about 1500 feet; the Yoredale shales and limestones may be 500 feet\r\nmore; so that the calcareous formations in which the volcanic phenomena\r\nare exhibited reach a thickness of at least 2000 feet.\r\n\r\nIt is not yet definitely known through what vertical extent of this\r\nthickness of sedimentary material the volcanic platforms extend, but\r\nwhere most fully developed they perhaps range through 1000 feet, lying\r\nchiefly in the Carboniferous Limestone, but apparently in at least one\r\nlocality extending up into the lower division of the Yoredale group.\r\nThe area within which they can be studied corresponds nearly with that\r\nin which the limestone forms the surface of the country, or a district\r\nmeasuring about 20 miles from north to south, with an extreme breadth\r\nof 10 miles in an east and west direction.\r\n\r\nA special historical interest belongs to the Derbyshire\r\n\"toadstones.\"[18] They furnished Whitehurst with material for his\r\nspeculations, and were believed by him to be as truly igneous rocks\r\nas the lava which flows from Hecla, Vesuvius or Etna. But he thought\r\nthat they had been introduced among the strata and \"did not overflow\r\nthe surface of the earth, according to the usual operations of\r\nvolcanoes.\"[19]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: This word has by some writers been supposed to be\r\ncorrupted from _tod-stein_, dead-stone, in allusion to the dying out of\r\nthe lead veins there; by others the name has been thought to be derived\r\nfrom the peculiar green speckled aspect of much of the rock, resembling\r\nthe back of a toad.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _An Enquiry into the Original State and Formation of the\r\nEarth_, 1778, Appendix, pp. 149, _et seq._]\r\n\r\nHis views were published as far back as 1778, three years after\r\nHutton read the first outline of his theory of the earth and made\r\nknown his observations regarding the igneous origin of whinstones.[20]\r\nThe first detailed account of the Derbyshire eruptive rocks was that\r\ngiven by Fairey,[21] which has served as the basis of all subsequent\r\ndescriptions. Conybeare, in particular, prepared a succinct narrative\r\nfrom Fairey's more diffuse statements, and thus placed clearly\r\nbefore geologists the nature and distribution of these volcanic\r\nintercalations.[22] Subsequently the district was mapped by De la Beche\r\nand the officers of the Geological Survey, and the areas occupied by\r\nthe several outcrops of igneous rock could then be readily seen.[23]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ i. p. 275, _et seq._ Hutton\r\nspecially mentions the toadstone of Derbyshire as one of the rocks\r\nproduced by fusion, p. 277.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _General View of the Agriculture and Minerals of\r\nDerbyshire_ (1811).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales_ (1822), p.\r\n448.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: See Sheets 71 N.W., 72 N.E., 81 N.E. and S.E. and 82 S.W.\r\nof the Geological Survey of England and Wales.]\r\n\r\nThough the \"toadstones\" were believed to form definite platforms among\r\nthe limestone strata, and thus to be capable of being used as reliable\r\nhorizons in the mineral fields of Derbyshire, they appear to have\r\nbeen generally regarded as intrusive sheets like the Whin Sill of the\r\nnorth. Thus De la Beche in his _Manual of Geology_, giving a summary\r\nof what was known at the time regarding intercalated igneous rocks,\r\nremarks with regard to the Derbyshire toadstones that they may from\r\nall analogy be considered to have been injected among the limestones\r\nwhich would be easily separated by the force of the intruded igneous\r\nmaterial.[24] But the same observer, after his experience among the\r\nancient volcanic rocks of Devonshire, came fully to recognize the\r\nproofs of contemporaneous outflow among the Derbyshire toadstones. In\r\nhis subsequently published _Geological Observer_, he described the\r\ntoadstones as submarine lavas that had been poured out over the floor\r\nof the sea in which the Carboniferous Limestone was deposited, and had\r\nbeen afterwards covered up under fresh deposits of limestone.[25] It is\r\nremarkable, however, that he specially comments on the absence, as he\r\nbelieved, of any contemporaneously ejected ashes and lapilli, such as\r\noccur in Devonshire. That true tuffs or volcanic ashes are associated\r\nwith the toadstones was noticed by Jukes in 1861,[26] and afterwards by\r\nthe Geological Survey.[27] Since that time geologists have generally\r\nrecognized these Derbyshire igneous rocks as truly contemporaneous\r\nintercalations. But very little has recently been written on the\r\nstructure of the district, our information regarding it being still\r\nbased mainly on the early observations of Fairey and the mapping of the\r\nGeological Survey.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Manual_, 3rd edit. 1833, p. 462.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: _Geological Observer_ (1851), pp. 642-645.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _Student's Manual of Geology_, 2nd edit. (1863), p. 523.\r\nFor a general _résumé_ of the proofs of contemporaneity furnished by\r\nthe toadstones, see \"The Geology of North Derbyshire,\" by Messrs. A.\r\nH. Green and A. Strahan (_Memoirs of the Geological Survey_, 2nd edit.\r\n(1887), p. 123).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: In the first edition of the _Memoir on the Geology of\r\nNorth Derbyshire_, published in 1859, the authors of which were Messrs.\r\nA. H. Green, C. le Neve Foster and J. R. Dakyns.]\r\n\r\nThe subject, however, has now been resumed by Mr. H. Arnold Bemrose,\r\nwho in 1894, after a prolonged study of the petrography of the\r\nrocks, communicated the results of his researches to the Geological\r\nSociety.[28] In his excellent paper, to which I shall immediately make\r\nfuller reference, he mentions the localities at which lava-form and\r\nfragmental rocks may be observed, but does not enter on the discussion\r\nof the geological structure of the region or of the history of the\r\nvolcanic eruptions. Before the announcement of his paper, hearing that\r\nI proposed to make for the first time a rapid traverse of the toadstone\r\ndistrict, for the purpose of acquainting myself with the rocks on the\r\nground, he kindly offered to conduct me over it. My chief object,\r\nbesides that of seeing the general nature of the volcanic phenomena of\r\nthe region, was to examine more particularly the areas of the volcanic\r\nfragmental rocks, with the view of discovering whether among them some\r\nremains might not be found of the actual vents of discharge. In this\r\nsearch I was entirely successful. Aided by Mr. Bemrose's intimate\r\nknowledge of the ground, I was enabled to visit in rapid succession\r\nthose tracts which seemed most likely to furnish the required evidence,\r\nand in a few days was fortunate enough to obtain proofs of six or seven\r\ndistinct vents, ranging from the extreme northern to the furthest\r\nsouthern boundary of the volcanic district. Mr. Bemrose has undertaken\r\nto continue the investigation, and will, I trust, work out the detailed\r\nstratigraphy of the Carboniferous Limestone so as eventually to furnish\r\nan exhaustive narrative of the whole volcanic history of Derbyshire.\r\nMeanwhile no adequate account of the area can be given. But I will here\r\nstate all the essential facts which up to the present time have been\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. l. (1894), p. 603.]\r\n\r\n1. THE ROCKS ERUPTED.--Mr. Allport has described the microscopic\r\ncharacter of some of the toadstones,[29] and further details have\r\nbeen supplied by Mr. Teall.[30] The fullest account of the subject,\r\nhowever, is that given by Mr. Bemrose in the paper above referred to.\r\nThis observer distinguishes the lava-form from the fragmental rocks,\r\nand gives the minute characters of each series. He does not, however,\r\nseparate true interstratified lavas from injected sills, nor the bedded\r\ntuffs from the coarse agglomerates which fill up the vents. These\r\ndistinctions are obviously required in order that the true nature and\r\nsequence of the materials in the volcanic eruptions may be traced,\r\nand that the phenomena exhibited in Derbyshire may be brought into\r\ncomparison with those found in other Carboniferous districts. But\r\nto establish them satisfactorily the whole region must be carefully\r\nre-examined and even to some extent re-mapped.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xxx. (1874), p. 529.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: _British Petrography_, p. 209.]\r\n\r\nThe lavas (including, in the meantime, sheets which there can be\r\nlittle doubt are sills) show three main types of minute structure\r\nand composition, which are discriminated by Mr. Bemrose as--(_a_)\r\nOlivine-dolerites; these, the most abundant of the series, consist\r\nof augite in grains, olivine in idiomorphic crystals, plagioclase\r\ngiving lath-shaped and tabular sections, and magnetite or ilmenite\r\nin rods and grains; (_b_) Ophitic olivine-dolerites, consisting of\r\naugite in ophitic plates forming the groundmass, in which are imbedded\r\nidiomorphic olivine, plagioclase (often giving large lath-shaped\r\nsections and magnetite or ilmenite); (_c_) Olivine-basalts; these rocks\r\nare distinguished by containing crystals of augite and olivine in a\r\ngroundmass of small felspar-laths, granular augite and magnetite or\r\nilmenite, with very little interstitial matter. They have been noticed\r\nonly in two of the outcrops of toadstone.\r\n\r\nThe fragmental rocks have been shown by Mr. Bemrose to cover a much\r\nmore extensive space than had been previously supposed. He has found\r\nthem to be distinguished by an abundance of lapilli varying from minute\r\nfragments up to pieces about the size of a pea, and composed of a\r\nmaterial that differs in structure from the dolerites and basalts with\r\nwhich the tuffs are associated. These lapilli consist largely of a\r\nglassy base more or less altered, which is generally finely vesicular\r\nand encloses abundant skeleton crystals and crystallites. The tuffs\r\nthus very closely resemble some of the Carboniferous basic tuffs of\r\nFife, already referred to (vol. i. p. 422), and like these they include\r\nabundant blocks of dolerite and basalt.\r\n\r\n2. GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF THE TOADSTONE DISTRICT.--As the volcanic\r\nrocks of Derbyshire lie among the Carboniferous Limestones of a broad\r\nanticlinal dome, they are only exposed where these limestones have been\r\nsufficiently denuded, and as the base of the limestones is nowhere laid\r\nbare, the lowest parts of the volcanic series may be concealed. Over\r\nthe tract where the toadstones can be examined they appear as bands\r\nregularly intercalated with the limestones, but varying in thickness in\r\nthe course of their outcrops. As they are prone to decay, they usually\r\nform smooth grassy slopes between the limestone scarps, though isolated\r\nblocks of the dull brown igneous rocks may often be seen protruding\r\nfrom the surface. Now and then a harder bed of toadstone caps a hill,\r\nand thus forms a prominent feature in the landscape, but as a rule\r\nthese igneous bands play no distinguishing part in the scenery, and are\r\nindeed less conspicuous than the white escarpments of limestone which\r\noverlie them.\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of the older geologists that three distinct\r\nplatforms of toadstone extend without break throughout the district,\r\nand subdivide the limestones into four portions. But this opinion\r\ndoes not seem to have been based on good evidence either of sequence\r\nor of continuity. Various facts were brought forward by the officers\r\nof the Geological Survey to show that the supposed persistence of the\r\nthree platforms of toadstone did not really exist, but that these\r\nsheets of igneous material are found at different spots on very\r\ndifferent horizons, and are of limited horizontal range.[31] So far as\r\nmy own limited observations go, they entirely corroborate this view.\r\nThere can be little doubt, I think, that the identity of certain\r\noutcrops of toadstone has been assumed, and the assumption has been\r\ncarried throughout the district. The truth is that the number of\r\nsuccessive platforms on which igneous materials appear will never be\r\nsatisfactorily determined until the stratigraphy of the Derbyshire\r\nCarboniferous Limestone is worked out in detail. When the successive\r\nmembers of this great calcareous formation have been identified by\r\nlithological and palæontological characters over the district, it will\r\nbe easy to allocate each outcrop of toadstone to its true geological\r\nhorizon. When this labour has been completed, it will probably be found\r\nthat instead of three, there have been many discharges of volcanic\r\nmaterial during the deposition of the limestone series; that these\r\nhave proceeded from numerous small vents, and that they are all of\r\ncomparatively restricted horizontal extent. Such a detailed examination\r\nwill also determine how far the toadstones include veritable sills, and\r\non what horizons these intrusive sheets have been injected.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: _Geol. Surv. Mem. on North Derbyshire_, by Messrs. Green\r\nand Strahan (1887), p. 104.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we know that the lowest visible bands of toadstone\r\nare underlain by several hundred feet of limestone, thus proving that\r\nthe earliest known volcanic explosions took place over the floor\r\nof the Carboniferous Limestone sea, after at least 700 or 800 feet\r\nof calcareous sediment had accumulated there. The latest traces of\r\nvolcanic activity are found in a part of the Yoredale group of shales\r\nand limestones which form the uppermost member of the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone of this region. But it is not quite clear whether the\r\nvesicular diabase found there is interstratified or intrusive.\r\nCertainly no contemporaneous tuffs have yet been found among the\r\nYoredale rocks, nor in any higher subdivision of the Carboniferous\r\nsystem, though coarse agglomerates marking the position of vents do\r\ntraverse the Yoredale group at Kniveton.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that in the district over which the toadstones can\r\nbe seen, two areas are recognizable, in each of which the exposures of\r\nthe igneous rocks are numerous, while between them lies an intervening\r\ntract wherein there is hardly any visible outcrop of these rocks. The\r\nnorthern and much the more extensive area stretches from Castleton\r\nto Sheldon, while the southern spreads from Winster to Kniveton.\r\nThis distribution not improbably points to the original position of\r\nthe vents, and indicates a northern more numerous group of volcanic\r\norifices, and a southern tract where the vents were fewer, or at least\r\nspread their discharges over a more limited space.\r\n\r\n3. THE VENTS.--It had always appeared to me singular that, in ground\r\nso deeply trenched by valleys as the toadstone district of Derbyshire,\r\nno trace had been recognized of any bosses or necks from which these\r\nvolcanic sheets might have been erupted. It is true that in mining\r\noperations masses of toadstone had been penetrated to a considerable\r\ndepth without their bottom being reached, and the suggestion had been\r\nmade that in such cases a shaft may actually have been sunk on one\r\nof the vents through which the toadstone came up.[32] One instance in\r\nparticular was cited where, at Black Hillock, on Tideswell Moor, close\r\nto Peak Forest Village, a mass of toadstone was not cut through, though\r\npierced to a depth of 100 fathoms. In that neighbourhood, however,\r\nseveral of the sheets of eruptive material are probably sills, and the\r\nshaft at Black Hillock may have been sunk upon the pipe or vein that\r\nsupplied one or more of these intrusive sheets.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: _Geol. Surv. Mem. on North Derbyshire_, p. 134.]\r\n\r\nIt was therefore with no little interest that I detected a series of\r\nvents at four separate localities, viz. Castleton, Grange Mill, Hopton,\r\nand Kniveton Wood. I have no doubt that a more extended search will\r\nbring others to light. Those observed by me are all filled with coarse\r\nagglomerate, the blocks in which are mostly composed of different\r\nlavas, sometimes with the addition of blocks of limestone, while the\r\nmatrix consists mainly of lapilli of basic devitrified glass.\r\n\r\nThe most typical examples form a group of two, possibly three, vents\r\nwhich rise into two isolated, smooth, grassy dome-shaped hills at\r\nGrange Mill, five miles west from Matlock Bath.[33] In external form\r\nand colour, these eminences present a contrast to the scarped slopes\r\nof limestone around them. They at once recall the contours of many of\r\nthe volcanic necks in Central Scotland. On examination it is found that\r\nthe material composing them is a dull green agglomerate, the matrix\r\nof which is a compact substance weathering spheroidally, and full of\r\nsmall lapilli of minutely vesicular diabase. The larger stones consist,\r\nfor the most part, of various vesicular dolerites or diabases, together\r\nwith some pieces of limestone and occasionally large blocks of the\r\nlatter rock, altered into a saccharoid condition. Two dykes of dolerite\r\nor basalt traverse the margin of the larger vent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: This is Mr. Bemrose's outcrop, No. 46, _op. cit._ p. 633.]\r\n\r\nThe steep sides of these agglomerate domes rise from the low ground\r\naround them to a height of 100 to 180 feet, their summits being a\r\nlittle more than 900 feet above the sea. The smaller neck is nearly\r\ncircular, and measures about 1000 feet in diameter. The larger mass\r\nis less regular in shape, and is prolonged into such a bulge on the\r\nsouth-east as to suggest that its prolongation in that direction may\r\nreally mark the position of a third and much smaller vent contiguous to\r\nit. The longer diameter of the larger mass is 2300 and the shorter 1300\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 178.--View of two volcanic necks in the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone series, at Grange Mill, five miles west of\r\nMatlock Bath, from the north.]\r\n\r\nOn the south and west sides, the surrounding limestone can be traced\r\nup to within a few feet of the edge of the agglomerate, and its strata\r\nare there found to be much jumbled and broken, while their texture is\r\nrather more crystalline than usual, though not saccharoid. The two\r\nnecks are separated by a narrow valley in which no rock is visible.\r\nTheir opposite declivities meet at the bottom of this hollow, and are\r\nso definitely marked off that, even in the absence of proof that they\r\nare disjoined by intervening limestone, there can be little hesitation\r\nin regarding each hill as marking a distinct vent. A wider valley\r\nextends along the eastern base of the necks, and slopes upward on its\r\neast side until it is crowned by a long escarpment of limestone, which\r\nreaches a height of 1000 feet above the sea, or about 100 feet above\r\nthe valley from which it rises. Unfortunately, the bottom and slopes\r\nof this depression are thickly covered with soil, but at one or two\r\nplaces debris of fine tuff may be observed, and at the northern and\r\nsouthern ends of the hollow well-bedded green and reddish tuff appears,\r\ndipping gently below the limestone escarpment. This band of volcanic\r\ndetritus evidently underlies the limestone, and forms most of the\r\ngentle slope on the east side of the valley. It may be from 70 to 100\r\nfeet thick. That it was discharged from one or both of the necks seems\r\ntolerably clear. Its material resembles that forming the matrix of the\r\nagglomerate. The general arrangement of the rocks at this interesting\r\nlocality is represented in Fig. 179, which is reduced from my survey on\r\nthe scale of six inches to a mile. A section across the smaller vent\r\nwould show the structure represented in Fig. 180.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 179.--Plan of necks and bedded tuff at Grange Mill,\r\nfive miles west of Matlock Bath.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 180.--Section across the smaller volcanic neck and\r\nthe stratified tuff in Carboniferous Limestone, Grange Mill.\r\n\r\n1. Limestone; 2. Stratified tuff intercalated among the limestones; 3.\r\nAgglomerate.]\r\n\r\nThis group of vents lies in the southern of the two tracts of the\r\nvolcanic district. In the northern tract a mass of agglomerate pierces\r\nthe base of the limestone escarpment about a quarter of a mile west\r\nfrom the entrance to the Peak Cavern at Castleton.[34] It is rudely\r\nsemicircular in area, stretching down the slope until its northern\r\nextension is lost under the lower ground. The agglomerate is not well\r\nexposed, but it can be seen to be a green, granular crumbling rock,\r\nmade up in great part of minutely vesicular lapilli, enclosing blocks\r\nof various diabases two feet long or more. From the abrupt way in which\r\nthis agglomerate rises through the limestone, there can be little doubt\r\nthat it marks the position of one of the volcanic vents of the time.\r\nAs it stands on the extreme northern verge of the limestone area,\r\nthe ground further north being covered with the Yoredale rocks and\r\nMillstone Grit, it is the most northerly of the whole volcanic district.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: This is outcrop No. 1 of Mr. Bemrose's paper, p. 625.]\r\n\r\nAlong the southern margin of the limestone country a group of\r\nagglomerate masses probably marks another chain of vents. These are\r\nspecially interesting, inasmuch as they abut on the Yoredale series,\r\nand may thus be looked upon as among the latest of the volcanic\r\nchimneys. One of them is seen at Hopton,[35] where along the side of the\r\nroad a good section is exposed of coarse tumultuous agglomerate, having\r\na dull green matrix, composed of green, brown, and black, minutely\r\ncellular, basic, devitrified, glassy lapilli, showing under the\r\nmicroscope abundant microlites and crystals or calcareous pseudomorphs\r\nof olivine, augite, and felspar, and much magnetite dust. Through\r\nthis matrix are distributed blocks of slaggy basalt and dolerite. An\r\ninteresting feature of this mass is the occurrence in it of some veins,\r\ntwo or three inches broad, of a compact black porphyritic basalt. I\r\ndid not trace the relations of this agglomerate to the stratified\r\nrocks around it. But its internal structure and composition mark it\r\nout as a true neck. It extends, according to the Geological Survey\r\nmap, for about half a mile along the edge of the limestone, and is\r\nrepresented as being separated by two faults from the Yoredale series\r\nimmediately to the south. So long as the belief is entertained that\r\nthe toadstones are contemporaneous outflows of lava lying on certain\r\ndefinite horizons, far below the summit of the limestones, the position\r\nof the Hopton agglomerate is only explicable on the assumption of some\r\ndislocation by which the Yoredale shales have been brought down against\r\nit. But when we realize that the rock is an unstratified agglomerate,\r\nprobably marking the place of a volcanic vent, and therefore rising\r\ntransgressively through the surrounding strata, the necessity for a\r\nfault is removed, or if a fault is inserted its existence should be\r\njustified on other evidence than the relations of the igneous rock to\r\nthe surrounding strata.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: _Geol. Surv. Mem. North Derbyshire_, p. 24. This is\r\noutcrop No. 53 of Mr. Bemrose's paper, p. 635.]\r\n\r\nFour miles to the south-west of Hopton, on the slope of the hill\r\nat Kniveton Wood, another remarkable mass of agglomerate forms a\r\nrounded ridge between the two forks of a small stream.[36] Its granular\r\nmatrix, like that of the other necks, consists of lapilli of minutely\r\nvesicular basic glassy lava or pumice, and encloses large and small\r\nrounded blocks of finely cellular basalt and pieces of limestone. The\r\nrock is unstratified, and in all respects resembles that of ordinary\r\nCarboniferous necks in Scotland. Its relations to the Yoredale rocks\r\nare laid bare in the channels of the streamlets. There the shales and\r\nthin limestones may be seen much broken and plicated, their curved\r\nand fractured ends striking directly at the agglomerate. They may be\r\ntraced to within a yard of the agglomerate. On the Geological Survey\r\nmap the igneous rock is represented as bounded by two parallel faults.\r\nBut I hardly think that this explanation suffices to account for the\r\nrelations of the rocks and their remarkable boundary-line, which seems\r\nto me to be undoubtedly the wall of a volcanic vent. To the east of\r\nthe streams, another mass of agglomerate may mark another neck, while\r\nto the north, a third detached area of the same kind of rock, rising\r\namong the limestones, may be regarded as likewise a distinct mass. At\r\nthis locality, therefore, there are two, possibly three, vents. One of\r\nthese, from the way in which it cuts across the Yoredale shales and\r\nlimestones, is to be assigned to a time later than the older part of\r\nthe Yoredale series, and thus, like the Hopton mass, it indicates that\r\nin the south of the volcanic area eruptions did not cease with the\r\nclose of the deposition of the thick limestones, but were prolonged\r\neven into the time of the Yoredale rocks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Outcrop No. 56, p. 638 of Mr. Bemrose's paper.]\r\n\r\nA further proof of the late age of these southern patches of volcanic\r\nmaterial is shown by two bands of vesicular toadstone in the Yoredale\r\nseries, a little south from the village of Kniveton. These rocks are\r\ntraced on the Survey Map, and are shown in a diagram in the Memoir,\r\nwhere their position is sought to be explained by a system of parallel\r\nfaulting.[37] I was able to trace the actual contact of the western band\r\nwith the strata underneath it, and satisfied myself that there is no\r\nfault at the junction. The igneous material is regularly bedded with\r\nthe Yoredale shales and limestones. Either, therefore, these bands\r\nare intercalated lava-streams or intrusive sills. If mere vesicular\r\nstructure were enough to distinguish true outflowing lavas, then there\r\ncould be no doubt about these Kniveton rocks. But this structure is\r\nfound in so many Carboniferous sills, particularly in those thin sheets\r\nwhich have been injected into coals and black shales, that its presence\r\nis far from decisive. The vesicles in the Kniveton rocks are small and\r\npea-like, tolerably uniform in size and shape, and crowded together.\r\nThey are thus not at all like the irregular cavities in the ordinary\r\ncellular and scoriaceous lavas of the toadstone series.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: _Op. cit._ p. 87.]\r\n\r\nWhether or not the question of their true relations be ever\r\nsatisfactorily settled, these Kniveton bands are certainly younger than\r\nthe lower portion of the Yoredale group. Their evidence thus agrees\r\nwith that of the southern agglomerates in showing that the volcanic\r\nactivity of this region was continued even after the thick calcareous\r\nmasses of the Carboniferous Limestone series had ceased to be deposited.\r\n\r\nBesides the six necks to which I have referred, a rock in Ember Lane,\r\nabove Bonsall, probably belongs to another vent.[38] It is particularly\r\ninteresting from the great preponderance of limestone fragments in\r\nit. The volcanic explosions at this locality broke up the already\r\nsolidified limestones on the floor of the Carboniferous Limestone sea,\r\nand strewed them around, mingled with volcanic blocks and dust of the\r\nprevailing type.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: This is outcrop No. 39 of Mr. Bemrose's paper, p. 632.]\r\n\r\nWhen the district has been more carefully searched, other centres of\r\neruption will no doubt be discovered. It may then be possible to depict\r\nthe distribution of the active vents, and to connect with them the\r\noutflow of the bedded lavas. So far as I have been able to ascertain,\r\nthere are no necks of dolerite or basalt, though, as I have shown,\r\ndykes or veins of molten rock are occasionally to be found in the\r\nagglomerates of the necks.\r\n\r\n4. THE LAVAS AND TUFFS.--I have referred to the opinion of De la Beche\r\nthat the toadstones of Derbyshire were poured out as lava-streams\r\nwithout any accompanying fragmentary discharges, and to the correction\r\nof this opinion by the subsequent observations of Jukes and of the\r\nGeological Survey. But though the existence of interbedded tuffs\r\nhas long been known, it was not until Mr. Bemrose's more careful\r\nscrutiny that the relative importance of the tuffs among the lavas was\r\nfirst indicated. He has shown that a number of the bands mapped as\r\n\"toadstone\" are tuffs, and he has discovered other bands of tuff which\r\nhave not yet been placed on any published map.\r\n\r\nIn examining the outcrops of the various toadstones of Derbyshire we\r\nlearn that some of them are lavas without tuffs, probably including a\r\nnumber of bands, which are really sills; that others are formed of both\r\nlavas and tuffs, and that a third type shows only bedded tuff. Each\r\nof these developments will deserve separate description. But before\r\nentering into details, we may take note of the varying thicknesses of\r\nthe different toadstones which have been determined by observation at\r\nthe surface or by measurement underneath in mining operations. In some\r\ncases a distinct band of toadstone, separated by many feet or yards of\r\nlimestone from the next band, and therefore serving to mark a separate\r\nvolcanic discharge, may not exceed a yard or two in total thickness,\r\nand from that minimum may swell out to 100 feet. The majority of the\r\nbands probably range between 50 and 100 feet in thickness. In one\r\nexceptional case at Snitterton, a mass of \"blackstone\" is said to have\r\nbeen proved to be 240 feet thick, but this rock may not improbably have\r\nbeen a sill.[39] The true contemporaneous intercalations seem to be\r\ngenerally less than 100 feet in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: A difference is made by the mining community between\r\n\"toadstone\" and what is called \"blackstone.\" The former name appears\r\nto be restricted to the amygdaloidal green and generally more or less\r\ndecayed lavas; the latter, so far as I can learn, is applied to the\r\ndark, more solid and crystalline rocks. If this distinction be well\r\nfounded the one name may perhaps serve to mark the open cellular lavas,\r\nthe other the more compact, dark, and heavy intrusive sheets.]\r\n\r\n(_a_) Lavas without Tuffs.--Examples occur of sheets of toadstone\r\nwhich consist entirely of contemporaneously ejected diabase, basalt\r\nor dolerite. This rock is then dull green or brown in colour, more or\r\nless earthy in texture, and irregularly amygdaloidal. The vesicles are\r\nextremely varied in size, form and distribution, sometimes expanding\r\nuntil the rock becomes a slaggy mass. A central more solid portion\r\nbetween a scoriaceous bottom and top may sometimes be observed, as\r\nat the Great Rocks Quarry, Peak Forest Limeworks (Fig. 181). In this,\r\nas in other examples, a remarkably hummocky and uneven surface of\r\nlimestone lies below the igneous band, the calcareous rock presenting\r\nknobs and ridges, separated by cauldron-shaped cavities and clefts,\r\nsome of which are several yards deep. These inequalities are filled\r\nin and covered over with a soft yellow and brown clay, varying up to\r\nthree or four feet thickness, and passing upwards into the more solid\r\ntoadstone. There can hardly be any doubt that this singularly uneven\r\nlimestone surface is due to the solvent action of water lying between\r\nthe limestone and the somewhat impervious toadstone above, and that the\r\nclay represents partly the insoluble residue of the calcareous rock,\r\nbut chiefly the result of the action of the infiltrating water on the\r\nbottom of the igneous band.[40]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: _Geological Survey Memoir on North Derbyshire_, p. 20 and\r\nfootnote.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 181.--Section of vesicular and amygdaloidal diabase resting on\r\n  Carboniferous limestone, Peak Forest Limeworks, Great Rocks Quarry.\r\n\r\n  1. Limestone with a surface dissolved into cauldron-like\r\n  hollows; 2. Rotten yellow and brown clay resulting from\r\n  decomposition of toadstone and white clay from the solution of the\r\n  limestone--sometimes three or four feet thick; 3. Toadstone, a\r\n  diabase with highly slaggy base.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 182.--View of the superposition of Carboniferous\r\nlimestone upon toadstone, Raven's Tor, Millersdale (length about 100\r\nfeet).\r\n\r\n1. Toadstone; 2. Limestone; _f_, Fault.]\r\n\r\nJunctions of the upper surfaces of the lava-sheets with the overlying\r\nlimestone show that the igneous material sometimes assumed hummocky\r\nforms, which the calcareous deposits gradually overspread and\r\ncovered.[41] A good example of this kind may be observed by the roadside\r\nat the foot of Raven's Tor, Millersdale. As shown in the subjoined\r\nfigure, the limestone has here been worn into a cave, the floor of\r\nwhich is formed by the toadstone. The latter rock, of the usual dull\r\ngreen, slaggy and amygdaloidal character, is covered immediately by the\r\nlimestone, but I did not observe any fragments of the toadstone, nor\r\nany trace of ashy materials in the overlying calcareous strata. This\r\nsection shows that after the outflow of the lava, the sedimentation of\r\nthe limestone was quietly resumed, and the igneous interruption was\r\nentirely buried.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: Compare De la Beche, _Geological Observer_, pp. 559, 560,\r\nand _North Derbyshire Memoir_, p. 123.]\r\n\r\nIn some cases there is evidence of more than one outflow of lava in the\r\nsame band of toadstone. Jukes believed that each band \"was the result,\r\nnot of one simultaneous ejection of igneous matter, but of several,\r\nproceeding from different foci uniting together to form one band,\" and\r\nhe found that near Buxton, two solid beds of toadstone could be seen\r\nto have proceeded from opposite quarters towards each other without\r\noverlapping.[42]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: _Student's Manual of Geology_, 2d edit. (1862), p. 523.]\r\n\r\nIn Millersdale the authors of the _Geological Survey Memoir on North\r\nDerbyshire_ observed that a band of toadstone about 100 feet thick\r\nshowed six distinct divisions, which they were disposed to regard as\r\nmarking so many separate beds.[43] In Tideswell Dale, on the west side\r\nof the valley, immediately to the south of the old toadstone quarry,\r\ntwo bands of toadstone are seen to be separated by a few yards of\r\nlimestone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: _Op. cit._ p. 19.]\r\n\r\n(_b_) Lavas with Tuffs.--It will probably be found that in many, if\r\nnot in most cases, the outflow of lava was preceded, accompanied or\r\nfollowed by fragmental discharges. As far back as 1861, Jukes noticed\r\nthat a toadstone band, about 50 feet thick, near Buxton consisted of\r\ntwo solid beds of lava \"with beds of purple and green ash, greatly\r\ndecomposed into clay, both above and below each bed and between the\r\ntwo.\"[44]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: _Op. cit._ p. 523.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 183.--Section at lime-kiln, south of Viaduct, Millersdale\r\n  Station.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAn interesting section, showing this intercalation of the two kinds\r\nof material is exposed at the lime-kilns beyond the southern end of\r\nthe railway viaduct at Millersdale Station. Over a mass of solid blue\r\nlimestone (1 in Fig. 183) lies a band of bright yellow and brown\r\nclay (2), varying from six inches to two feet in thickness. This may\r\nbe compared with the clay found above the limestone at Peak Forest\r\n(Fig. 181). But it is probably a layer of highly decomposed tuff.\r\nIt is succeeded by a thin band of greenish limestone (3) containing\r\nan admixture of fine volcanic detritus, and partially cut out by an\r\nirregular bed, four to eight feet thick, of a highly slaggy, greenish,\r\ndecomposing, spheroidal and amygdaloidal diabase (4). This unmistakable\r\nlava-sheet is followed by a bed of green granular tuff (5), which\r\nin some places reaches a thickness of three feet, but rapidly dies\r\nout. Over a space several yards in breadth, the succeeding strata are\r\nconcealed, and the next visible rock is a dark, compact dolerite which\r\nweathers spheroidally (6).\r\n\r\n(_c_) Tuffs without Lavas.--Mr. Bemrose has shown that some of the\r\nbands of toadstone consist entirely of bedded tuff. In these cases, so\r\nfar as the present visible outcrops allow us to judge, no outflow of\r\nlava accompanied the eruption of fragmentary materials. But that the\r\nejection of these materials was not the result of a sudden spasmodic\r\nexplosion, but of a continued series of discharges varying in duration\r\nand intensity, is indicated by the well-bedded character of the tuff\r\nand the alternation of finer and coarser layers. Large blocks of\r\nlava, two feet or more in diameter, may mark some of the more vigorous\r\nparoxysms of the vents, while the usual fine granular nature of the\r\ntuff may point to the prevailing uniformity and less violent character\r\nof the eruptions. Bands of tuff 70 feet or more in thickness, without\r\nthe intercalation of any limestone or other non-volcanic intercalation,\r\npoint to episodes of such continued volcanic activity that the ordinary\r\nsedimentation of the sea-bottom was interrupted, or at least masked, by\r\nthe abundant fall of dust and stones.\r\n\r\nOne of the best exposures of such intercalations of bedded tuffs was\r\npointed out to me by Mr. Bemrose, immediately to the east of the\r\nvillage of Litton. The matrix is crowded with the usual minutely\r\nvesicular glassy lapilli, and encloses fragments of diabase of all\r\nsizes, up to blocks more than a foot in diameter. The rock is well\r\nstratified, and the layers of coarse and fine detritus pass beneath\r\na group of limestone beds. The actual junction is concealed under\r\nthe roadway, but only two or three feet of rock cannot be seen. The\r\nlowest visible layer of limestone is nodular and contains decayed\r\nbluish fragments which may be volcanic lapilli. Immediately above the\r\nlower limestones the calcareous bands become richly fossiliferous.\r\nSome of their layers consist mainly of large bunches of coral; others\r\nare crowded with cup-corals, or are made up mainly of crinoids with\r\nabundant brachiopods, polyzoa, lamellibranchs, gasteropods and\r\noccasional fish-teeth. This remarkable profusion of marine life is\r\ninteresting inasmuch as it succeeds immediately the band of volcanic\r\nash.\r\n\r\nAnother well-marked zone of tuff, with no traceable accompaniment of\r\nlava, has already been referred to as connected with the Grangemill\r\nvents. In this case also, the limestone that lies directly upon the\r\nvolcanic material is rather impure and nodular in character. The tuff\r\nitself is well bedded, perhaps from 70 to 100 feet thick and dips\r\nunderneath an overlying series of marine limestones.\r\n\r\nI did not observe thin partings of tuff and disseminated volcanic\r\nlapilli among the limestones, such as are so marked in the Lower\r\nCarboniferous formations of West Lothian, and in the Limerick basin,\r\nto be described in the following chapter. But a diligent search might\r\ndiscover examples of them, and thus prove that, besides the more\r\nprolonged and continuous eruptions that produced the thick bands of\r\ntuff, there were occasional feeble and intermittent explosions during\r\nthe accumulation of the thick sheets of limestone. Some of the layers\r\nof \"red clay\" observed in shafts sunk for mining purposes may perhaps\r\nrepresent such spasmodic discharges of fine fragmental material.\r\n\r\n5. THE SILLS.--No attempt has yet been made to determine whether and\r\nto what extent the toadstone bands include true intrusive sheets. My\r\nown brief examination of the ground does not warrant me in making\r\nany positive statement on this subject. I can hardly doubt, however,\r\nthat some, perhaps not a few, of the toadstone bands are really\r\nsills. In the accounts of these rocks contained in the mining records\r\na distinction, as already remarked, appears to have been generally\r\ndrawn between \"toadstone\" and \"blackstone.\" The latter term is applied\r\nto the black, fresh, more coarsely crystalline, and generally\r\nnon-amygdaloidal rocks, which, so far as I have been able to examine\r\nthem, have the general external and many of the internal characters of\r\nthe Carboniferous sills of Central Scotland. At Snitterton near Matlock\r\none of these \"blackstones,\" as already mentioned, is said to have been\r\nfound to be 240 feet thick.[45]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: _North Derbyshire Memoir_, p. 23.]\r\n\r\nIt is stated that the toadstones, though subject to great variations\r\nin thickness, are never seen to cut across the limestones.[46] But\r\nI suspect that proofs of intrusion and transgression will be found\r\nwhen diligently sought for. It appeared to me that the dark, compact,\r\ncrystalline dolerite, which was formerly quarried in the middle of\r\nTideswell Dale, may be separated from the vesicular toadstone of\r\nthat valley, which is undoubtedly a true lava-flow, and that it does\r\nnot always occupy the same horizon there, being sometimes below and\r\nsometimes above the amygdaloid. Where it rests on a band of red clay\r\nthe latter rock has been made columnar to a depth of nine feet.[47]\r\nAlteration of this kind is very rare among the Carboniferous bedded\r\nlavas, but is by no means infrequent in the case of sills. But the\r\nmost important proof of alteration which I have myself observed occurs\r\nat Dale Farm near the village of Peak Forest, where the limestone\r\nabove a coarsely crystalline dolerite has been converted into a white\r\nsaccharoid marble for about two yards from the junction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: _Op. cit._ p. 123.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: J. M. Mello, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xxvi. (1871),\r\np. 701.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE ISLE OF MAN\r\n\r\nRising from the middle of the Irish Sea, within sight of each of the\r\nthree kingdoms, with a history and associations so distinct, yet so\r\nintimately linked with those of the rest of Britain, this interesting\r\nisland presents in its geological structure features that connect it\r\nalike with England, Scotland and Ireland, while at the same time it\r\nretains a marked individuality in regard to some of the rocks that\r\nform its framework. Its great central ridge of grits and slates, which\r\nstill rises 2000 feet above the sea in the summit of Snaefell, must\r\nhave formed a tract of dry land in Carboniferous time, until it sank\r\nunder sea-level, and was buried beneath the Carboniferous and later\r\nformations. Along the southern margin of this ancient land, a relic of\r\nthe floor of the Carboniferous sea has been preserved in a small basin\r\nof Carboniferous Limestone which covers about seven or eight square\r\nmiles. This remnant has a special interest in geological history, for\r\nit has preserved the records of a series of volcanic eruptions which\r\ntook place contemporaneously with the deposition of the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone.\r\n\r\nThe geology of the Isle of Man was sketched in outline by J. F.\r\nBerger,[48] J. Macculloch,[49] and J. S. Henslow,[50] and was afterwards\r\nmore fully illustrated by J. G. Cumming.[51] To the last-named observer\r\nwe owe the recognition of true intercalated volcanic rocks among\r\nthe calcareous formations of the southern end of the island. These\r\nrocks have subsequently been studied in greater detail by a number of\r\ngeologists. An excellent general account of them was published in 1874\r\nby Mr. John Horne, of the Geological Survey.[52] A few years later some\r\nfurther observations on them were prepared by J. Clifton Ward.[53] More\r\nrecently their petrography has been studied by Messrs. E. Dickson, P.\r\nHolland and F. Rutley,[54] and in more detail by Mr. B. Hobson.[55] To\r\nsome of the observations of these writers reference will be made in\r\nthe succeeding pages. During the progress of the Geological Survey in\r\nthe Isle of Man, the rocks in question have been mapped in detail by\r\nMr. A. Strahan and Mr. G. W. Lamplugh, and I have had an opportunity\r\nof examining the coast-sections with the last-named geologist. The\r\nfollowing description of these sections is taken mainly from my field\r\nnote-book. The full details will appear in the official _Memoirs_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: _Trans. Geol. Soc._ 1st ser. vol. ii.

This\r\npaper was reprinted with additions and corrections in _Yn Lioar\r\nManninagh_, Douglas, Isle of Man, vol. i. No. 10, April 1892.]\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked at the outset that the last outcrop of the\r\nplateau-lavas of the Solway basin occurs only 60 miles from the south\r\nend of the Isle of Man, at the foot of the hills of Galloway, the blue\r\noutline of which can be seen from that island. The distance from the\r\nManx volcanoes to the nearest of the puys of Liddesdale is about 100\r\nmiles. Though the fragment which has been left of the ejections is too\r\nsmall to warrant any confident parallelism, there appears to be reason\r\nto believe that, alike in geological age and in manner of activity, the\r\nManx volcanoes may be classed with the type of the puys.\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous strata of the Isle of Man lie in a small trough at\r\nthe south end of the island. The lowest members of the series consist\r\nof red conglomerates and sandstones, which pass upward into dark\r\nlimestones full of the characteristic fossils of the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone. As the bottom of the basin is on the whole inclined\r\nseawards, the highest strata occur along the extreme southern coast. It\r\nis there that the volcanic rocks are displayed. They occupy a narrow\r\nstrip less than two miles in length, which is almost entirely confined\r\nto the range of cliffs and the ledges of the foreshore. Yet though\r\nthus extremely limited in area, they have been so admirably dissected\r\nalong the coast, that they furnish a singularly ample body of evidence\r\nbearing on the history of Carboniferous volcanic action.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the bottom of the volcanic group is nowhere visible.\r\nAt the east or lower end of the series, exposed on the shore, an\r\nagglomerate with its dykes appears to truncate the Castletown\r\nLimestones. No trace of any tuff has been noticed among these lower\r\nlimestones. We may infer that the volcanic activity began after they\r\nwere deposited. The highest accessible portions of the volcanic group,\r\nas Mr. Horne showed, are clearly exposed on the coast at Poyll Vaaish,\r\nintercalated in and overlying the dark limestones of that locality\r\n(Fig. 184), which have been assigned, from their fossil contents, to\r\nthe upper part of the Carboniferous Limestone series.[56] The Manx\r\nvolcanoes may therefore be regarded as having probably been in eruption\r\nduring the later portion of the Carboniferous Limestone period.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: R. Etheridge jun., in Mr. Horne's paper above cited.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 184.--Limestones passing under stratified tuffs,\r\nPoyll Vaaish, Isle of Man.]\r\n\r\nOwing to irregularities of inclination, the thickness of the volcanic\r\ngroup can only be approximately estimated. It is probably not less\r\nthan 200 or 300 feet. But as merely the edge of the group lies on the\r\nland, the volcanic rocks may reach a considerably greater extent and\r\nthickness under the sea.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic materials consist mainly of bedded tuffs, but include\r\nalso several necks of agglomerate and a number of dykes and sills. So\r\nfar as I have observed, they comprise no true lava-streams.[57] These\r\nManx tuffs present many of the familiar features of those belonging\r\nto the puy-eruptions of Central Scotland, but with some peculiarities\r\nworthy of attention. They are on the whole distinctly bedded, and as\r\ntheir inclination is generally in a westerly direction, an ascending\r\norder can be traced in them from the eastern end of the section to the\r\nhighest parts of the group associated with the Poyll Vaaish limestones.\r\nTheir colour is the usual dull yellowish-green, varying slightly in\r\ntint with changes in the texture of the materials, the palest bands\r\nconsisting of the finest dust or volcanic mud. Great differences in the\r\nsize of their fragmentary constituents may be observed in successive\r\nbeds, coarse and fine bands rapidly alternating, with no admixture\r\nof non-volcanic sediment, though occasional layers of fine ash or\r\nmudstone, showing distinct current-bedding, may be noticed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: The occurrence of intercalated lavas has been described\r\nin this series, but, as I shall show in the sequel, they are probably\r\nintrusive masses.]\r\n\r\nPauses in the succession of eruptions are marked by the intercalation\r\nof seams of limestone or groups of limestone, shale and black impure\r\nchert. Such interstratifications are sometimes curiously local and\r\ninterrupted. They may be observed to die out rapidly, thereby allowing\r\nthe tuff above and below them to unite into one continuous mass. They\r\nseem to have been accumulated in hollows of the tuff during somewhat\r\nprolonged intervals of volcanic quiescence, and to have been suddenly\r\nbrought to an end by a renewal of the eruptions. There are some four or\r\nfive such intercalated groups of calcareous strata in the thick series\r\nof tuffs, and we may regard them as marking the chief pauses in the\r\ncontinuity or energy of the volcanic explosions.\r\n\r\nAn attentive examination of these interpolated sedimentary deposits\r\naffords some interesting information as to the submarine conditions in\r\nwhich the eruptions took place. The intercalations, sometimes 12 feet\r\nor more in thickness, consist mainly of dark limestones, enclosing\r\nthe usual Carboniferous Limestone fossils; black shales, sometimes\r\nshowing very fragmentary and much macerated remains of ferns and other\r\nland-plants; and black impure argillaceous chert or flint, arranged\r\nin bands interposed between the other strata, and also in detached\r\nlumps and strings. The dark flaggy limestones and black shales may\r\nbe paralleled lithologically with those of Castletown and Poyll\r\nVaaish. Indeed, there seems to be little doubt that they represent\r\nthe contemporaneous type of marine sediment that was gathering on\r\nthe sea-floor outside the volcanic area, and which during intervals\r\nof quiescence or feeble eruptivity spread more or less continuously\r\ninto that area. The thick mass of tuff must thus have been strictly\r\ncontemporaneous with a group of calcareous muddy and siliceous deposits\r\nwhich gathered over the bottom beyond the limits of the showers of\r\nashes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 185.--Section of tuff, showing intercalations of\r\nblack impure chert, west of Closenychollagh Point, near Castletown,\r\nIsle of Man.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most singular features of these sedimentary intercalations\r\nis the occurrence of the black cherty material. It may generally be\r\nobserved best developed at the bottom and top of each group of included\r\nstrata. Looking at the lumps of this substance scattered through the\r\nadjoining tuffs, we might at first take them for ejected fragments, and\r\nsuch no doubt may have been the derivation of some of them. But further\r\nexamination will show that, as a rule, they are of a concretionary\r\nnature, and were formed _in situ_ contemporaneously with or subsequent\r\nto the deposition of the tuffs. The accompanying section (Fig. 185)\r\nrepresents the manner in which the chert is distributed through two\r\nor three square yards of tuff overlying one of the calcareous groups.\r\nThe material has been segregated not only into lumps, but into veins\r\nand bands, which, though on the whole parallel with the general\r\nstratification-planes of the deposits, sometimes run irregularly in\r\ntongues or strings across these planes, as shown in Fig. 186, where the\r\ndark chert band which overlies the limestones and shales sends a tongue\r\nupwards for several inches into the overlying tuff.\r\n\r\nThat these interstratified calcareous and muddy strata were laid down\r\nin water of some considerable depth may be inferred from their general\r\nlithological characters. The dark carbonaceous aspect of the limestones\r\npoints to the probable intermingling of much decayed vegetation with\r\nthe remains of the calcareous organisms of which these strata chiefly\r\nconsist. The thin unimportant bands or partings of dark shale show that\r\nonly the finest muddy sediment reached the quiet depths in which the\r\nstrata were deposited, while the macerated fern-fragments suggest a\r\nlong flotation and ultimate entombment of terrestrial vegetation borne\r\nseawards from some neighbouring land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 186.--Section of intercalated dark limestone, shale and chert\r\n  in the tuff south of Poyll Vaaish Bay, Isle of Man.\r\n\r\n1. Limestones and shales; 2. Chert; 3. Tuff.]\r\n\r\nThe cherty bands and nodules, like the flints of the chalk, bear their\r\ntestimony to the quiet character of the sedimentation in rather deep\r\nwater beyond the limits within which the sediment from the land was\r\nmainly accumulated on the sea-bottom. The origin of these siliceous\r\nparts of the series of deposits has still to be investigated. Whether\r\nor not they are to be referred to organic causes like chalk-flints, and\r\nthe radiolarian cherts of the Lower Silurian system, they furnish a\r\nfresh example of the remarkable association of such siliceous material\r\nwith volcanic phenomena, which has now been observed in many widely\r\nseparated areas all over the world.\r\n\r\nIf we next turn to the stratification of the tuffs, we obtain further\r\nevidence of undisturbed conditions of deposition on the sea-floor.\r\nThe bedding of these volcanic masses, though distinct, appears for\r\nthe most part to be due rather to the eruption and settlement of\r\nalternately finer and coarser detritus than to any marked drifting\r\nand rearrangement of these materials by current-action into different\r\nlayers. Throughout the series of tuffs, indeed, there is, on the whole,\r\na notable absence of any structure suggestive of strong currents or\r\nof wave-action in the dispersal and reassortment of the volcanic\r\ndetritus. The ashes and stones were discharged in such a way as to\r\ngather irregularly over the sea-floor into ridges and hollows. There\r\ndoes not seem to have been sufficient movement in the bottom water\r\nto level down these inequalities of surface, for we find that they\r\nremained long enough to allow twelve feet or more of calcareous and\r\nsiliceous ooze to gather in the hollows, while the intervening ridges\r\nstill stood uneffaced until buried under the next fall of ashes.\r\nAt rare intervals some transient current or deeper wave may have\r\nreached the bottom and spread out the volcanic detritus lying there.\r\nSuch exceptional disturbances of the still water are not improbably\r\nindicated by occasional well-defined stratification, and even by\r\ndistinct false-bedding, in certain finer layers of tuff.\r\n\r\nThe materials of the tuffs are remarkably uniform in character and\r\nconspicuously volcanic in origin. With the exception of occasional\r\nblocks of limestone, which range up to masses several feet, and\r\noccasionally several yards, in diameter, the dust, lapilli and included\r\nstones consist entirely of fragmentary basic lava, so persistent in\r\nits lithological features that we may regard its slightly different\r\nvarieties as merely marking different conditions of the same rock. The\r\naccumulation of pumiceous ash in this southern coast of the Isle of Man\r\nis one of the most remarkable in Britain. As Mr. Hobson has well shown,\r\nthe matrix of this tuff consists of irregular lapilli, representing\r\nwhat may have been various conditions of solidification in one original\r\nvolcanic magma. This magma he has described as an \"augite-porphyrite\"\r\nor olivine-basalt. Some of the lapilli, as he noted, consist of a\r\npumice \"crowded with vesicles which occupy more space than the solid\r\npart\"; others show nearly as many vesicles, but the glass is made brown\r\nby the number of its fine dust-like inclusions; a third type presents\r\nthe cells and cell-walls in nearly equal proportions. The same observer\r\nfound that where the substance is most cellular the vesicles, fairly\r\nuniform in size, measure about a tenth of a millimetre in longest\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature of the tuffs is the abundant occurrence of loose\r\nfelspar crystals throughout the whole group up to the highest visible\r\nstrata. These crystals, sometimes nearly an inch in length, appear\r\nconspicuously as white spots on weathered surfaces of the rock. They\r\nare so much decayed, however, that it is difficult to extract them\r\nentire. On the most cursory inspection they are observed to enclose\r\nblebs of a greenish substance like the material that fills up the\r\nvesicles in the pumiceous fragments and in the pieces of cellular lava.\r\n\r\nI have not ascertained the original source of these scattered felspars.\r\nIn one of the dykes on the north side of the agglomerate at Scarlet\r\nPoint, as was pointed out by Mr. Hobson, large crystals of plagioclase\r\noccur in the melaphyre, but the felspars in the tuffs and agglomerates\r\ndiffer so much from these that we cannot suppose them to have come from\r\nthe explosion of such a rock. I failed to detect any other mineral in\r\ndetached crystals in the tuffs, but a more diligent search might reveal\r\nsuch, and afford some grounds for speculating on the probable nature\r\nof the magma from the explosion of which the scattered crystals were\r\nderived. It is at least certain that this magma must have included a\r\nlarge proportion of plagioclase crystals.\r\n\r\nBetween the lapilli and the minute pumice-dust that constitute the\r\nmatrix of this tuff much calcite may be detected. Though this mineral\r\nmay have been partly derived from the decay of the felspar in the\r\nlava-fragments, I believe that it is mainly to be attributed to the\r\nintermingling of fine calcareous ooze with the ash accumulated on the\r\nsea-floor. A more remarkable association of the same kind will be\r\ndescribed in later pages from King's County in Ireland. That abundant\r\ncalcareous organisms peopled the sea in which the Manx Carboniferous\r\nvolcanoes were active is shown by the contemporaneously deposited\r\nlimestones. The tuffs themselves are occasionally fossiliferous.\r\nSpecies of _Spirifer_, _Productus_ and other brachiopods, together\r\nwith broken stems of encrinites, may be found in them, and doubtless\r\nthe diffused calcite, though now crystalline, as in the limestones, and\r\nshowing no organic structure, owes its presence to the detritus of once\r\nliving organisms.\r\n\r\nThe stones imbedded in the tuff consist almost exclusively of slightly\r\ndifferent varieties of the same pale, always vesicular rock, and\r\nsometimes pass into a coarse slag. They vary up to six feet or more\r\nin length. In many cases, they appear to have been derived from the\r\ndisruption of already solidified lava, for their vesicles are not\r\nelongated or arranged with reference to the form of the block, but have\r\nbeen broken across and appear in section on the outer surface. In other\r\ninstances, however, the cavities are large and irregular in the centre\r\nof the block, while on the outside they are smaller and are drawn out\r\nround the rudely spherical shape of the mass, as in true volcanic bombs.\r\n\r\nThe limestone fragments enclosed in the tuff include pieces of the\r\ndark carbonaceous and of the pale encrinal varieties. In no case did I\r\nobserve any sensible alteration of these fragments. They seem to have\r\nbeen derived from material disrupted and ejected during the opening of\r\nsuccessive vents, and not to have been exposed for any considerable\r\ntime to the metamorphic influence of volcanic heat and vapours.\r\n\r\nNarrow though the strip of volcanic material is along the south coast\r\nof the Isle of Man, it has fortunately preserved for us some of the\r\nvents from which the tuffs were ejected. A group of these vents, three\r\nor four in number, may be traced along the shore in a general W.N.W.\r\nand E.S.E. line from Scarlet Point for rather more than a mile. Their\r\nmargins are in some places exceedingly well defined. The most striking\r\nexample of this feature occurs in the most westerly vent, where a neck\r\nof remarkably coarse volcanic agglomerate rises vertically through\r\nwell-bedded, westerly-dipping tuff (Fig. 187). In other portions of\r\ntheir boundaries no sharp line can be drawn between the material\r\nfilling the vent and that of the surrounding tuffs. Hence it is\r\ndifficult to define precisely the form and size of the vents. I am\r\ninclined to believe from this indefiniteness of outline, and from the\r\nremarkable structure of the dykes, to which I shall afterwards refer,\r\nthat the presently visible parts of these necks must lie close to the\r\nmouths of the original vents, if indeed they do not actually contain\r\nparts of the craters and of their surrounding walls.\r\n\r\nThe materials that have filled up the eruptive vents consist\r\nchiefly of agglomerate, but partly also of intrusive portions of\r\nvesicular lava. The agglomerate is composed of similar materials to\r\nthe tuffs. Its matrix shows the same extraordinarily abundant fine\r\ngreenish-grey basic pumiceous lapilli, with the same kind of plentiful\r\nloose felspar-crystals. The large blocks of lava, too, resemble in\r\ncomposition and structure those of the bedded tuffs, but greatly exceed\r\nthem in size and abundance.\r\n\r\nBesides the fragments of vesicular lava, there occur also occasional\r\nblocks of limestone. Some of these are several yards in length.\r\nMessrs. Strahan and Lamplugh have mapped a large mass of limestone\r\nat the Scarlet vent, which, so far as can be observed, lies in the\r\nagglomerate--a large cake of white limestone with pebbles of quartz,\r\nwhich has probably been broken off from some underlying bed and carried\r\nup in the chimney of the volcano.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the agglomerate is a tumultuous, unstratified mass. But in\r\nmany places it shows lines of bedding and, as already stated, passes\r\noutward into ordinary bedded tuff, the number and size of the ejected\r\nblocks rapidly diminishing. Where this transition occurs we seem to\r\nsee a remnant of the base of the actual volcanic cone. Thus, in the\r\nmost westerly vent already cited, while the wall of the vent has been\r\nlaid bare on the side next the sea, so that the agglomerate on the\r\nbeach descends vertically through the surrounding bedded tuffs, on the\r\nwestern side the cliffs have preserved a portion of the material that\r\naccumulated outside the orifice (Fig. 187). In this section we observe\r\nthat the coarse agglomerate which fills up the main part of the vent\r\nhas been left with a hummocky, uneven surface, and that a subsequent\r\nand perhaps feebler eruption of finer material has covered over these\r\ninequalities, and has extended to the left above the fine tuffs through\r\nwhich the agglomerate has been drilled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 187.--Section of part of a volcanic neck on shore\r\nto the south-east of Poyll Vaaish Bay, Isle of Man.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 188.--Section of successive discharges and\r\ndisturbances within a volcanic vent. Scarlet Point, Isle of Man.]\r\n\r\nAgain, in the largest of the vents, that near Scarlet Point, still\r\nclearer proof of successive eruptions and dislocations within a\r\nvolcanic chimney may be noticed. At one point the accompanying section\r\n(Fig. 188) has been laid bare by the waves. The oldest accumulation is\r\na fine green granular tuff (_a_), rudely and faintly arranged in layers\r\ninclined at high angles, like the fine materials in many of the vents\r\nof the basin of the Firth of Forth. This peculiar stratification, due\r\nnot to the assortment of materials in water, but to the deposition of\r\ncoarser and finer detritus by successive explosions, and to subsequent\r\nslipping or tilting, is a characteristic feature of the detritus which\r\nhas filled up ancient volcanic funnels. A later explosion from some\r\nadjacent part of the same vent has given rise to the discharge of a\r\ncoarse agglomerate (_b_), which with blocks sometimes six feet long,\r\noverspreads the earlier material. A third detrital accumulation in the\r\nsame vent, consisting of a firm brecciated tuff (_c_) with much calcite\r\nin its matrix, has been brought down by a slip (_f_) which cuts across\r\nboth of the previous deposits. A broad dyke (_d_) of vesicular diabase\r\n(augite-porphyry) traverses the vent, and is probably later than any of\r\nthe other rocks in the section.\r\n\r\nI will conclude this account of the Manx Carboniferous volcanic rocks\r\nwith a brief reference to the intrusive masses which form a prominent\r\nfeature of the coast-line. From the picturesque headland of Scarlet\r\nPoint the broad dyke which forms that promontory may be traced for\r\nsome distance westwards. Several other parallel dykes run in the\r\nsame direction which, it will be observed, is also that of the chain\r\nof vents. It might be said that the vents are, as it were, strung\r\ntogether by a line of dykes. These eruptive masses traverse both the\r\nagglomerates and the bedded tuffs. They probably belong, therefore,\r\nto a comparatively late part of the volcanic history. That they are\r\ntruly intrusive and not lava-flows is, I think, clearly shown by their\r\nvertical walls which descend through the surrounding rocks, and by\r\nthe greater closeness of their texture, as well as the diminution in\r\nthe size of their vesicles along the contact surfaces. But it must be\r\nadmitted that in their remarkably developed vesicular structure they\r\nlook more like streams of lava than ordinary dykes.\r\n\r\nIt is this structure which gives to these dykes their peculiar\r\ninterest. Bands of vesicles, from an inch or less to several inches in\r\nbreadth, run along the dykes parallel to the outer walls. Unlike the\r\nfamiliar rows of little amygdaloidal cells in ordinary basalt dykes,\r\nsuch as those of the Tertiary series in Scotland, these vesicles,\r\nthough small and pea-like in the narrower bands towards the margins of\r\nthe dykes, became so large, numerous, and irregular in the broader and\r\nmore central bands, that the rock passes there into a rough slag.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 189.--Section of dyke and sill in the tuffs west of\r\nScarlet Point, Isle of Man.]\r\n\r\nWhile the intrusive material has for the most part risen in the form\r\nof dykes, in one part of the coast-section, a little to the west\r\nof Scarlet Point, it has been injected as a sill among the bedded\r\ntuffs.[58] A section taken at this locality gives the structure\r\nrepresented in Fig. 189. On the north side of the great dyke, the\r\nstrata of tuff which dip under it, roll over and support an outlying\r\nsheet of the same material. The slaggy structure of parts of this sill\r\ngive it some resemblance to a true lava-flow. But it is the same\r\nstructure which can be seen in the dykes, while the closer grain along\r\nthe contact-surface further connects it with these intrusions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: It is this sheet which has been described as a\r\nlava-stream.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 190.--Section on south side of vesicular sill west of Scarlet\r\n  Point.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 191.--Bands of vesicles in the same sill.]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a peculiarity about the development of the\r\nvesicular structure in this sill which I have not observed anywhere\r\nelse. If we examine the southern side of the crag near its eastern\r\nend we observe that the successive bands of vesicles are arranged\r\nin the same direction as the surface of contact with the underlying\r\ntuffs, precisely as they are ranged in dykes parallel to the bounding\r\nwalls. So far the structure is quite normal. But, moving a few yards\r\nwestwards, we find that the bands begin to curve, and, instead of\r\nfollowing the contact surface, strike it first obliquely and then\r\nat right angles, until we have the structure shown in Fig. 191. The\r\nbands here vary from less than an inch to more than a foot in breadth,\r\nand where broadest assume a slaggy texture. I sought in vain for any\r\nevidence of subsequent disturbance such as might have truncated these\r\nparallel rows of vesicles and pushed the rock bodily over the tuffs.\r\nThe perfect parallelism of the bands with the surface of the tuff at\r\nthe east end, and the absence of all trace of a thrust-plane at the\r\nbase of the sill, seem to show that, though the rows of vesicles were\r\nundoubtedly at first arranged parallel to the surfaces between which\r\nthe intrusion took place, the mass, before completely consolidating and\r\ncoming to rest, was ruptured, and a portion of it was driven onwards at\r\nright angles to its previous line of movement.\r\n\r\nA consideration of the singularly slag-like structure of the injected\r\nmasses in the tuffs and agglomerates leads to the conclusion that\r\nthough what we now see of these rocks did not actually flow out at\r\nthe sea-bottom in streams of lava, it was intruded so close to the\r\nsurface that the imprisoned vapours had opportunity to expand, as in\r\nsuperficial outflows.[59] This inference is in accord with that derived\r\nfrom an examination of the necks, wherein we find evidence of the\r\nprobable survival of parts of the actual craters and volcanic cones.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: As illustrative of the occurrence of the vesicular\r\nstructure in superficial intrusions, I may again cite the dyke which\r\ncuts the ash of the outer crater-wall of the Puy de Pariou in Auvergne.\r\nThe andesite of this dyke is in places as vesicular as the lava-stream\r\nwith which it was doubtless connected, but the vesicles have been\r\nflattened and drawn out parallel to the walls of the dyke. In this\r\ninstance it is quite certain that there could never have been any great\r\ndepth of detrital material above the fissure into which the material of\r\nthe dyke was injected (see vol. i. p. 66).]\r\n\r\nAs the records of the earliest eruptions during the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone period in the district of the Isle of Man are concealed,\r\nso also those of the last of the series lie under the sea. Where the\r\nhighest visible tuffs overlie the Poyll Vaaish limestones they show\r\nno change in the nature of the materials ejected, or in the energy of\r\neruption. They lie so abruptly on the dark calcareous deposits as to\r\nshow that a considerable pause in volcanic activity was followed by a\r\nviolent explosion. The same abundant grey-green pumice, the same kind\r\nof loose crystals of felspar, the same type of lava-blocks and bombs\r\nas had characterized the foregoing eruptions remained as marked at the\r\nend. But the further volcanic records cannot be perused, and we are\r\nleft to speculate whether the coast-sections reveal almost the whole\r\nchronicle, or if they merely lay before us the early chapters of a\r\ngreat volcanic history of which the main records lie buried under the\r\nwaves of the Irish Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. EAST SOMERSET\r\n\r\nVarious limited outcrops of igneous rocks have long been known to\r\noccur in the eastern part of Somerset. The largest of these lies in\r\nthe midst of the Old Red Sandstone, on the crest of the axis of the\r\nMendip Hills, between Downhead and Beacon Hill. Smaller patches occur\r\nin the Carboniferous Limestone near Wrington Warren, on the north\r\nside of Middle Hope, on Worle Hill and at Uphill. These rocks have\r\nbeen mapped as intrusive, though some of them have been described as\r\nconglomeratic or as volcanic breccias. While some of the masses are\r\nprobably intrusive, others appear to be truly contemporaneous with\r\nthe deposition of the Carboniferous Limestone. The highly vesicular\r\nbasalt of Middle Hope looks much more like a superficial lava than\r\nan intrusion. Mr. Aveline gave a section showing three alternations\r\nof limestone and \"igneous rock\" at Middle Hope. A recent examination\r\nof that coast-line by Mr. A. Strahan shows that there are undoubted\r\ntuffs interstratified with the calcareous strata. There is thus\r\nproof that one or more small volcanic vents were in eruption on the\r\nfloor of the Carboniferous Limestone sea in the neighbourhood of\r\nWeston-super-Mare.[60]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: See _Geological Survey Memoir_ \"On East Somerset,\" by H.\r\nB. Woodward, 1876, and authorities there cited. Mr. Aveline's section\r\nabove referred to will be found on p. 22.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. DEVONSHIRE\r\n\r\nThe change from the typical Old Red Sandstone of South Wales\r\nto the Devonian system of Devonshire, to which I have already\r\nreferred, is hardly more striking than the contrast between the\r\nCarboniferous formations of these two areas.[61] The well-marked\r\nthreefold subdivisions of Carboniferous Limestone, Millstone Grit and\r\nCoal-measures, so persistent throughout Britain, and nowhere more\r\ntypically developed than in South Wales, are replaced in a distance of\r\nless than forty miles by the peculiar \"Culm-measures\" of Devonshire--a\r\nseries of black shales, grey sandstones and thin limestones and\r\nlenticular seams of impure coal (culm), which are not only singularly\r\nunlike in original characters to the ordinary Carboniferous formations,\r\nbut have been made still more unlike by the extensive and severe\r\ncleavage to which the Palæozoic rocks of Devon and Cornwall have been\r\nsubjected. That these Culm-measures are truly Carboniferous is made\r\nabundantly clear by their fossil contents, though it has not yet been\r\npossible to determine how far they include representatives of the great\r\nstratigraphical subdivisions in other parts of the country.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: In the centre of England numerous outlying areas of\r\nigneous rocks are found in the Carboniferous Limestone, Millstone Grit\r\nand Coal-measures. These will be considered by themselves in Chap.\r\nxxxii.]\r\n\r\nIt is to De la Beche that geology owes the first intimation of the\r\noccurrence of interstratified igneous rocks in the Carboniferous\r\nseries of Devonshire. As far back as the year 1834, in his singularly\r\nsuggestive treatise, _Researches in Theoretical Geology_, this eminent\r\ngeologist expressed his opinion that not only were the \"trappean\" bands\r\nregularly intercalated in the sedimentary series and continuously\r\ntraceable with the general stratification, but that they occurred at\r\nvarious localities in such a manner as to raise the suspicion that\r\nthese points may mark some of the centres of eruption. He particularly\r\ncited the example of Brent Tor as a remarkable volcanic-looking hill,\r\ncomposed in part of a conglomerate \"having every appearance of volcanic\r\ncinders.\"[62]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: _Op. Cit._ p. 384.]\r\n\r\nIn his subsequently published _Report on the Geology of Cornwall,\r\nDevonshire and West Somerset_, De la Beche dwelt in more detail on\r\nthe results of his study of these rocks, which he had traced out on\r\nthe ground and expressed upon the maps of the Ordnance Geological\r\nSurvey.[63] Hardly any additions have since been made to our knowledge\r\nof the field-relations of the rocks. It is to the maps and Report of\r\nDe la Beche that we must turn for nearly all the published information\r\non the subject. I shall therefore give here a summary of what can be\r\ngathered from these publications.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Sheets 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 31, 32 and 33.]\r\n\r\nIn tracing the limits of the Culm-measures, De la Beche found that\r\nno well-defined line could be drawn between these strata and the\r\n\"grauwacke\" or Devonian formations underneath. The Carboniferous\r\nseries lies in a great trough, of which the axis runs nearly east and\r\nwest, so that the lowest members of the series rise along the northern\r\nand southern margins. But De la Beche was struck with one remarkable\r\ncontrast between the two opposite sides of the trough--a contrast\r\nwhich marks the Devonian as well as the Carboniferous formations of\r\nthis region. On the south side an abundant and persistent group of\r\nintercalated bands of igneous, or as he called them, \"trappean,\"\r\nmaterials can be followed along the whole line of boundary, while\r\nno such group occurs on the north side. He found these bands to be\r\nlenticular, traceable sometimes for a number of miles, then dying out\r\nand reappearing on the same or other horizons. He mapped them the\r\nwhole way from Boscastle on the west to near Exeter on the east, and\r\nfound that though the individual sheets might be short, the trappean\r\nzone was continuous as far as the southern margin of the Carboniferous\r\nseries could be seen, except where it had been broken through by the\r\ngreat granitic mass of Dartmoor. He ascertained that the intercalated\r\ntrappean rocks are not confined to the Culm-measures, but occur also in\r\nthe contiguous portions of the \"grauwacke\" or Devonian system.\r\n\r\nBut further, he clearly recognized that the bands of igneous material\r\nwhich he mapped included both \"greenstones,\" together with other\r\nvarieties of massive eruptive rocks, and also volcanic ash or tuff,\r\nthough he did not attempt to separate these out upon the maps, but\r\ncontented himself with representing them all under the same colour.\r\nHe admitted that some doubt might be entertained as to the age of the\r\ngreenstones, for some of them might be intrusive and therefore later\r\nthan the sedimentary deposits between which they lie. But he contended\r\nthat there could be no uncertainty with regard to the trappean ash\r\nor tuff, which being regularly interstratified in the Carboniferous\r\nseries, must be contemporaneous with it. He pointed out that many of\r\nthe greenstones, as well as fragments in the conglomerates or ashes,\r\nwere highly vesicular and must originally have been in the condition of\r\npumice.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the centres of eruption from which these\r\nmaterials were ejected, De la Beche drew special attention once\r\nmore to the conspicuous eminence of Brent Tor and the rocks in its\r\nneighbourhood. His remarks on this subject are well worthy of being\r\nquoted--\"The idea that in the vicinity of Brent Tor a volcano has\r\nbeen in action, producing effects similar to those produced by active\r\nvolcanoes, forcibly presents itself. That this volcano projected ashes,\r\nwhich, falling into adjacent water, became interstratified with the\r\nmud, silt and sand there depositing, seems probable. That greenstones\r\nand other solid trappean rocks constituted the lavas of that period\r\nand locality, here and there intermingled with the ash, appears also a\r\nreasonable hypothesis. Upon the whole there seems as good evidence as\r\ncould be expected that to the north and north-west of Tavistock, ash,\r\ncinders and liquid melted rocks were ejected and became intermingled\r\nwith mud, silt and sand during this ancient geological epoch,\r\ncorresponding with the phenomena exhibited in connection with volcanoes\r\nof the present day, more particularly when they adjoin or are situated\r\nin the sea, or other waters where ejected ashes, cinders and lava can\r\nbe intermingled with ordinary mud, silt and sand.\"[64]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: _Op. cit._ p. 122.]\r\n\r\nIt remains for some future observer to fill up the outlines thus\r\nsketched by De la Beche, by tracing the respective areas of lavas and\r\ntuffs, distinguishing the various petrographical types, separating the\r\nintrusive from the interstratified sheets, identifying the necks and\r\nbosses that may mark centres of eruption, and expressing these various\r\ndetails upon maps on a sufficiently large scale.\r\n\r\nA serious difficulty in this research arises from the effect of the\r\nprofound alteration which has been produced on the igneous rocks by\r\nthe cleavage of the region. Many of the \"greenstones\" have been so\r\ncleaved as to become slaty or almost schistose. De la Beche recognized\r\nthis change and wrote of the \"schistose trappean ash.\" A result of this\r\nmetamorphism has been to impart to rocks originally massive the same\r\nfissile structure as the adjacent slates possess; and in this condition\r\nit is often hardly possible to distinguish between \"greenstone\" and\r\nfine-grained \"ash.\" There can indeed be little doubt that among these\r\nCarboniferous volcanic rocks, as we have seen to be the case with those\r\nof the Devonian system in the same region, many lavas or sills have\r\nbeen mapped as tuffs.\r\n\r\nThe chief additions to our knowledge of the Carboniferous volcanic\r\ngroup of Devonshire since the time of De la Beche have been made by\r\nMr. F. Rutley, Mr. W. A. Ussher and General M'Mahon. Mr. Rutley[65] has\r\nendeavoured to trace the respective areas occupied by the different\r\nvarieties of volcanic rocks in the district around Brent Tor, near\r\nTavistock, and to show the probable connection of the successive bands\r\nof lavas and tuffs with a central vent of discharge situated at that\r\nhill. He believes that these bands occur on four different horizons in\r\nthe sedimentary series. He has studied the microscopic structure of\r\nthe rocks, which in his view include \"amphibolites, gabbros, basalts,\r\npitchstones and schistose ashes, or clastic rocks of a doubtful\r\nnature.\"[66]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: \"The Eruptive Rocks of Brent Tor and its Neighbourhood,\"\r\n_Mem. Geol. Surv._ 1878. \"On the Schistose Volcanic Rocks occurring on\r\nthe west of Dartmoor, with some Notes on the Structure of the Brent Tor\r\nVolcano,\" _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xxxvi. (1880), p. 286.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: \"The Eruptive Rocks of Brent Tor,\" p. 45.]\r\n\r\nMr. Ussher has re-mapped the tract of Culm-measures on the east side\r\nof the Dartmoor granite, besides visiting some of the other areas\r\noutside of the granite mass. While confirming the general accuracy\r\nof De la Beche's survey, he has been able to improve the mapping\r\nby inserting more detail, separating especially the tuffs from\r\nthe \"greenstones.\" The latter have been found by him to be mostly\r\ndolerites, some of which, from their parallelism the bands of tuff,\r\nmay be in his opinion contemporaneous lavas, though the majority of\r\nthem are evidently intrusive. The tuffs are regularly interstratified\r\namong the Culm-measures, their most important band in this district\r\nhaving an average breadth of about 100 yards, and being traceable for\r\nat least two miles, possibly considerably further.[67] In going over\r\nthis tract with Mr. Ussher I was led to regard many of the sheets of\r\ndiabase (dolerite) or gabbro as true sills and bosses. Most of them\r\noccur as short lenticular or oval patches tolerably numerous, but not\r\ntraceable for more than a short distance, though a connection may\r\noften exist which cannot be detected by the scanty evidence on the\r\nsurface. One sheet which has been followed by Mr. Ussher from Combe\r\nto beyond Ashton, a distance of nearly two miles, presents in the\r\ncentre a somewhat coarsely crystalline texture which rapidly gives way\r\nto a much closer grain, and the rock then becomes highly vesicular.\r\nIt is overlain with dark Culm-shales and bands of fine shaly tuff,\r\npassing upward into a granular tuff. Some layers of this tuff assume\r\na finely foliated appearance by the development of pale leek-green\r\nfolia, which show slickensided surfaces parallel with the bedding. The\r\nrock then presents one of the usual appearances of schalstein. This\r\nstructure seems obviously due to mechanical movement along the planes\r\nof stratification.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: \"The British Culm-measures,\" _Proc. Somerset Archæol. and\r\nNat. His. Soc._ xxxviii. (1892), p. 161.]\r\n\r\nBands of black chert and cherty shale are interpolated among the tuffs,\r\nwhich also contain here and there nodular lumps of similar black impure\r\nearthy chert--an interesting association like that alluded to as\r\noccurring in the Carboniferous volcanic series of the Isle of Man, and\r\nlike the occurrence of the radiolarian cherts with the Lower Silurian\r\nvolcanic series already described.[68]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: Cherts containing numerous species of radiolaria have\r\nrecently been found by Dr. Hinde and Mr. Howard Fox to form an\r\nimportant part of the Lower Culm-measures of Devonshire, _Quart. Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc._ vol. li. (1895), p. 609.]\r\n\r\nThe volcanic belt in the valley of the Teign can be followed for\r\nabout two miles. It is undoubtedly interstratified among the dark\r\nCulm-measures, which are distinctly seen dipping under and overlying it.\r\n\r\nGeneral M'Mahon has recently shown what may be done by careful and\r\ndetailed examination of the ground broadly sketched in by De la Beche.\r\nHe chose for study a strip of \"greenstone\" shown on the Geological\r\nSurvey Map to extend for about three and a half miles along the\r\nnorth-west margin of the Dartmoor granite. He has found that what is\r\nrepresented under one wash of colour on that map includes both tuffs\r\nand lavas. The tuffs, in spite of the alteration which they appear\r\nto have undergone from the proximity of the great granite mass, are\r\nfound by microscopic investigation to be made up of fine volcanic\r\ndust containing minute lapilli of various lavas. Sometimes as many as\r\nsix or seven different kinds of lava may be represented in the same\r\nmicroscopic slide. These include felsitic or rhyolitic and trachytic\r\nrocks together with fragments of dark glassy lava full of magnetite\r\ndust. With the tuffs are intercalated sheets of felsite and trachyte.\r\nIn the same district coarse volcanic agglomerate occur, made up of\r\nblocks of different lavas and pieces of different sedimentary rocks.[69]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. l. (1894), p. 338.]\r\n\r\nThese observations are of special interest, inasmuch as they point to\r\nthe eruption of a much more acid series of volcanic lavas and tuffs\r\nthan had previously been known to exist in the Culm-measures. Until the\r\nground has been more accurately mapped, it is impossible to say whether\r\nthese rocks are older or younger than those that lie around Brent Tor,\r\na few miles to the south-west. General M'Mahon has noted the presence\r\nof more basic eruptive rocks in the same district. He specially cites\r\nthe occurrence of mica-diorite, of basaltic lavas altered into a\r\nserpentinous mass, and of a dolerite which may possibly mark the actual\r\nvent of the old Brent Tor volcano. His observations on the influence\r\nof the Dartmoor granite in inducing new mineral rearrangements in the\r\nigneous rocks of the Culm-measure series are full of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n                THE CARBONIFEROUS VOLCANOES OF IRELAND\r\n\r\n  King's County--The Limerick Basin--The Volcanic Breccias of\r\n  Doubtful Age in County Cork.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the Carboniferous system spreads over by far the larger\r\npart of the surface of Ireland, and is laid bare in many thousands\r\nof natural and artificial sections, it displays undoubtedly\r\ncontemporaneous igneous rocks, so far as at present known, at only one\r\nlocality--the region around Limerick. A second district, however, lies\r\nin King's County, where some vents occur which may be of Carboniferous\r\nage, and of which a description will be given in the following\r\npages. That the relics of volcanic action should be so few, while\r\nthe exposures of the Carboniferous formations are so numerous and so\r\ncompletely disclose the geological history of the whole system, must be\r\nregarded as good evidence that while volcanoes abounded and continued\r\nlong active in Scotland and in parts of the Centre and South-west\r\nof England, they hardly appeared at all in Ireland. It is worthy of\r\nremark, also, that the Irish eruptions belong to the time of the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone--a period distinguished by volcanic activity in\r\nScotland and England--that the nature of the materials erupted bears a\r\nclose resemblance to that of the lavas and tuffs of the sister island,\r\nand that the manner of their eruption finds a close counterpart in the\r\nPuy-eruptions, already described.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KING'S COUNTY\r\n\r\nIn the progress of the Geological Survey several small tracts of\r\n\"greenstone ash\" and \"greenstone\" were mapped within an area of a few\r\nsquare miles lying to the north of Philipstown. These igneous rocks\r\nwere shown to form Croghan Hill, which, rising into a conical eminence\r\n769 feet above the sea, and some 450 feet above the general level of\r\nthe great limestone plain around it, forms the only conspicuous feature\r\nin the landscape for many miles. In the maps and their accompanying\r\nExplanations, the \"greenstones\" are treated as intrusive masses, but\r\nthe \"greenstone ash\" or breccia appears to have been regarded as\r\ninterstratified in the Carboniferous Limestone, though the admission\r\nis made that \"from the scanty exposures of the rocks and the total\r\nabsence of any connected section, it has been found impossible to\r\narrive at any definite conclusion as to the relations existing between\r\nthese traps and ashes with regard to each other or to the surrounding\r\nlimestone.\"[70]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: See Sheets 109 and 110 of the Geological Survey of Ireland\r\nand Explanation to accompany Sheets 98, 99, 108 and 109, by F. J. Foote\r\nand J. O'Kelly (1865), pp. 7-18.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of a brief visit to this locality I did not succeed in\r\nobtaining any certain proof of the age of the igneous rocks, but I\r\nfound their structures to be more varied and interesting than would be\r\ninferred from the way in which they have been mapped, and I came to\r\nthe conclusion that the strong balance of probability was in favour of\r\nregarding them as of the age of the Carboniferous Limestone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 192.--Croghan Hill, King's County, from S.S.W.]\r\n\r\nThe first and most important fact to be announced regarding the\r\ndistrict is that it includes a group of volcanic necks which rise\r\nthrough the Carboniferous Limestones. The chief of these forms Croghan\r\nHill. It is nearly circular in ground-plan, and measures about 4000\r\nfeet in diameter from the limestone on one side to that on the other.\r\nIt rises with steep grassy slopes out of the plain, the naked rock\r\nprojecting here and there in crags and low cliffs. Its general outward\r\nresemblance to the Carboniferous necks of Scotland strikes the eye of\r\nthe geologist as he approaches it (Fig. 192).\r\n\r\nBut Croghan Hill, though the chief, is not the only vent of the\r\ndistrict. It forms the centre round which a group of subsidiary vents\r\nhas been opened. These form smaller and lower eminences, the most\r\ndistant being one and a half miles E.S.E. from the summit of Croghan\r\nHill, and measuring approximately 1200 feet in its longest and 800 feet\r\nin its shortest diameter.\r\n\r\nThat the igneous materials of these necks really break through the\r\nlimestones may be clearly seen in several sections. Thus by the\r\nroadside at Gorteen, on the south-western side of Croghan Hill, the\r\nlimestones have been thrown into a highly inclined position, dipping\r\ntowards the east at 60° or more, and their truncated ends abut against\r\nthe side of the neck. Again, on the eastern side of the same hill the\r\nlimestones have been much disturbed close to the margin of the neck,\r\nsometimes dipping towards the volcanic centre, and sometimes striking\r\nat it. Among these strata a small neck of breccia, of which only a\r\nfew square yards are visible, rises close to the edge of the bog that\r\ncovers the adjacent part of the great plain.\r\n\r\nThe material which chiefly forms these necks is one of the most\r\nremarkable breccias anywhere to be found in the volcanic records\r\nof the British Isles. The first feature noticeable in it is the\r\npumiceous character of its component fragments. These consist of a\r\npale bluish-grey basic pumice, and are generally about the size of\r\na hazel-nut, but descend to mere microscopic dust, while sometimes\r\nexceeding a foot in length. They are angular, subangular and rounded.\r\nOccasionally they stand out as hollow shells on weathered surfaces, and\r\nin one instance I noted that the vesicles were flattened and drawn out\r\nparallel to the surfaces of the shell, as if deformed by gyration, like\r\na true bomb.\r\n\r\nThe breccia remains singularly uniform in character throughout all\r\nthe necks. Its basic pumice presents much resemblance to that so\r\ncharacteristic of the Carboniferous necks of Scotland, Derbyshire and\r\nthe Isle of Man. The abundant vesicles are generally spherical, and as\r\nthey have been filled with calcite or chlorite, they look like small\r\nseeds scattered through a grey paste. Though I broke hundreds of the\r\nlapilli, I did not notice among them any volcanic rock other than this\r\npumice. I am not aware of any other neck so homogeneously filled up\r\nwith one type of pyroclastic material, and certainly there is no other\r\nexample known in the British Isles of so large and uniform a mass of\r\nfragmentary pumice.\r\n\r\nLimestone fragments are not uncommon in this breccia. They resemble\r\nthe strata around the vents. Pieces of the adjacent cherts may also be\r\nobserved. In one or two cases, the limestone fragments were found by\r\nme to have an exceptionally crystalline texture, which may possibly\r\nindicate a certain degree of marmarosis, but on the whole there is\r\nlittle trace of alteration.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of pumice in the breccia are bound together by a cement\r\nof calcite. In fact the rock is, so to speak, saturated with calcareous\r\nmaterial, which, besides filling up the interstices between the\r\nlapilli, has permeated the pumice and filled up such of its vesicles as\r\nare not occupied by some chloritic infiltration.\r\n\r\nI did not observe unmistakable evidence that any part of the breccia is\r\nstratified and intercalated among the limestones, nor any vestige of\r\nashy material in these limestones. But it is possible that traces of\r\nsuch interstratification may occur in the low ground to the north-west\r\nof Croghan Hill, which I did not examine.\r\n\r\nIn only two places did I notice even a semblance of the intercalation\r\nof limestone in the breccia. One of these is at Gorteen, where a\r\nband of limestone strata a few feet thick is underlain and overlain\r\nby breccia. But though the superposition of the layers of finely\r\nstratified dark limestone and chert on the breccia is well seen and\r\nthoroughly defined, no lapilli or ashy material are to be seen in\r\nthe limestone. Detached pieces of similar limestone and chert occur\r\nin the breccia. The band of stratified rock, if _in situ_, may be a\r\ntongue projecting from the wall into the body of the neck, like some\r\ninstances already cited from Scotland, but more probably it is really a\r\nlarge included mass lying within the vent itself. The breccia here as\r\nelsewhere is entirely without any trace of stratification. The second\r\nlocality occurs at the most easterly neck north of Coole House, where\r\nthe limestones, rapidly undulating, seem at last to plunge below the\r\nbreccia, which shows a series of parallel divisional planes suggestive\r\nof bedding. But these may be only joint-structures, for there is no\r\nstratification of the component materials of the rock.\r\n\r\nIn the necks, and also through the limestone surrounding them, masses\r\nof eruptive rock have been intruded as irregular bosses and veins.\r\nThe material of these intrusions presents little variety, and, so far\r\nas I could note, gives no indication of the successive protrusion\r\nof progressively different lava. It varies from a deep blue-black\r\nfine-grained basalt to a dolerite where the plagioclase is distinct.\r\nSome portions, however, are more basic and pass into limburgite.\r\nExternally there is nothing worthy of special remark in these rocks\r\nunless it be their prevalent amygdaloidal structure. The amygdales,\r\ngenerally of calcite, vary from small pea-like forms in the basalts\r\nup to kernels half an inch long or more in the dolerites. From a\r\nmicroscopic examination Mr. Watts found that some of the basalts\r\nhave a base of felspar and augite rich in brown mica, and that their\r\nporphyritic felspars enclose idiomorphic crystals of augite.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most noticeable feature in these later parts of the\r\nvolcanic series is the occurrence in them at one locality in Croghan\r\nDemesne of lumps of a highly crystalline material quite distinct from\r\nthe surrounding rock. These enclosures vary from an inch or two to a\r\nfoot or more in diameter. They must be regarded as blocks which have\r\nbeen carried up in the ascent of the basic lava. Their composition\r\nhas been ascertained by Mr. Watts from microscopic examination to\r\nbe somewhat singular. One specimen \"contains relics of garnets,\r\nsurrounded by rings of kelyphite, imbedded in a mosaic of felspar,\r\nwith a mineral which may possibly be idocrase.\" Another specimen from\r\nthe same locality (south-east from Gorteen) \"contains the relics of\r\ngarnets preserved as kelyphite, set in a matrix of quartz-grains, much\r\nstrained, and containing a profusion of crystals of greenish-yellow or\r\nred sillimanite. This appears to be a metamorphic rock, and may be a\r\nfragment of some sediment enclosed in the igneous rocks.\"[71]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: _Guide to the Collections of Rocks and Fossils belonging\r\nto the Geological Survey, in the Museum of Science and Art, Dublin_\r\n(1895), pp. 38, 39.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the history of volcanic action in Britain one of the\r\nchief points of interest connected with these Irish breccias and\r\nlavas relates to their geological age. As no proof has been produced\r\nthat any portion of them is contemporaneously interstratified in the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone which surrounds them, we cannot definitely\r\naffirm that the volcanic eruptions which they record took place during\r\nthe accumulation of that formation. The vents must, of course, be\r\nlater than that portion of the limestone which they pierce. But the\r\nevidence seems to me to be on the whole most favourable to the view\r\nthat they are of Carboniferous Limestone age, for the following\r\nreasons:--\r\n\r\n1. The breccias of Croghan Hill do not present a resemblance to any of\r\nthose belonging to the Tertiary volcanic series in Antrim or the Inner\r\nHebrides. The possibility of their being of Tertiary age may therefore\r\nbe dismissed from consideration.\r\n\r\n2. There are no known Permian volcanic rocks in Ireland. Nor does the\r\nCroghan Hill breccia show any resemblance to the ordinary material of\r\nthe breccias in the Permian necks of Scotland. It is thus not likely to\r\nbe of Permian age.\r\n\r\n3. The peculiar basic pumice of these Croghan Hill vents has many\r\npoints in common with the palagonite fragments so abundant among\r\nthe volcanic breccias and tuffs of Carboniferous age in Scotland,\r\nDerbyshire, and the Isle of Man, and which occurs also among the\r\nCarboniferous tuffs of the Limerick basin. It differs from the\r\ngeneral type of the material in its pale colour, in its uniformity\r\nof character, in its calcareous cement, and above all in its vast\r\npreponderance over all the other materials in the breccia.\r\n\r\n4. The saturation of the Croghan Hill breccia with calcite is a\r\nsingular feature in the composition of the rock. Had the vents\r\nbeen opened long subsequent to the deposition of the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone, it is difficult to understand how this calcite could\r\nhave been introduced. Mere percolation of meteoric water from the\r\nadjacent limestone does not seem adequate to account for the scale\r\nand thoroughness of the permeation. But if the vents were opened on\r\nthe floor of the Carboniferous Limestone sea, it is intelligible that\r\nmuch fine calcareous silt should have found its way down among the\r\ninterstices of the breccia and into the pores of the pumice which,\r\nbeing caked together within the vent, did not all float away when the\r\nsea gained access to the volcanic funnel. The effect of subsequent\r\npercolation would doubtless be to carry the lime into still unfilled\r\ncrevices, and to impart to the cement a crystalline structure similar\r\nto that which has been developed in the ordinary limestones.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE LIMERICK BASIN\r\n\r\nAbout 70 miles to the south-west of the area just described lies the\r\nmost compact, and, for its size, one of the most varied and complete,\r\nof all the Carboniferous volcanic districts of Britain (Map I.). It\r\ntakes the form of an oval basin in the Carboniferous Limestone series\r\nnear the town of Limerick, about twelve miles long from east to west\r\nand six miles broad from north to south. Round this basin the volcanic\r\nrocks extend as a rim about a mile broad. A portion of a second or\r\ninner rim, marking a second and higher volcanic group, partially\r\nencloses a patch of Millstone Grit or Coal-measures, which lies in the\r\nheart of the limestone basin. (See the section in Fig. 196.)\r\n\r\nBut it is evident that, as the denuded edges of the volcanic sheets\r\nemerge at the surface all round the basin, the present area over\r\nwhich these rocks extend must be considerably less than that which\r\nthey originally covered. Some indication of their greater extension\r\nis supplied by outliers of the bedded lavas and tuffs, as well as by\r\nbosses which doubtless indicate the position of some of the eruptive\r\nvents. The distance between the furthest remaining patches is 24 miles.\r\nThe original tract over which the volcanic materials were spread cannot\r\nhave been less than 24 miles long by 10 miles broad. If we assume its\r\narea to have been between 250 and 300 square miles we shall probably be\r\nunder the truth.\r\n\r\nThis volcanic centre made its appearance on the floor of the\r\nCarboniferous Sea in the same district which had witnessed the\r\neruptions of Upper Old Red Sandstone time. The two visible vents that\r\ncrown the Knockfeerina and Ballinleeny anticlines (Chapter xxii.), are\r\nonly some ten miles distant, and there may be others of the same age\r\neven under the Limerick basin. This district thus supplies another\r\ninstance of that recurrence of volcanic energy in the same area,\r\nafter a longer or shorter geological interval, which stands out as a\r\nconspicuous feature in the history of volcanic action in Britain. That\r\na prolonged interval elapsed between the extinction of the Old Red\r\nSandstone volcanoes and the outbreak of their successors during the\r\naccumulation of the Carboniferous limestone series, may be inferred\r\nfrom the thickness of strata which separate their respective tuffs.\r\nFrom the published sections of the Geological Survey there would appear\r\nto be about 500 feet of Old Red Sandstone above the volcanic series of\r\nthat formation. Then comes the Lower Limestone shale, which is computed\r\nto be about the same thickness. From the scarcity of observable dip\r\namong the Lower Limestones and their variable inclination, it is not\r\neasy to form any satisfactory estimate of the depth of this group up\r\nto the base of the volcanic series. It may be as much as 800 feet,[72]\r\nand if so there would thus intervene a mass of sedimentary material\r\nnearly 2000 feet in thickness between the two volcanic platforms.\r\nThroughout this thick accumulation of stratified deposits no trace\r\nof contemporaneous volcanic activity has been detected. From the\r\ndescriptions published more than thirty years ago by Jukes and his\r\ncolleagues in the Geological Survey of Ireland, geologists learnt\r\nhow full and interesting are the proofs of great volcanic activity\r\ncontemporaneous with the deposition of the Carboniferous Limestone\r\nseries in the Limerick district.[73] Nowhere, indeed, is the evidence\r\nmore complete for the occurrence of a long succession of volcanic\r\neruptions during a definite period of geological time. The officers of\r\nthe Survey showed that two epochs of activity during the older part\r\nof the Carboniferous period were each marked by a group of tuffs and\r\nlavas, while the interval of quiescence between them is represented\r\nby a thousand feet of limestone. The same observers likewise mapped\r\noutside the volcanic ring a number of eruptive bosses, which they\r\nregarded as probably marking some of the actual vents of that time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: This is the thickness given in the Explanation to Sheet\r\n144 of the Geological Survey of Ireland, p. 8. A still greater\r\nthickness is claimed in Explanation to Sheet 154, p. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: See especially Explanations of Sheets 143, 144, 153 and\r\n154, Geol. Surv. Ireland (1860, 1861). The geology of the district\r\nhad been previously noticed by earlier observers, to whose writings\r\nreference is made on p. 26 of the Explanation of Sheet 144. See also\r\nJas. Apjohn, _Journ. Geol. Soc. Dublin_, vol. i. (1832), p. 24;\r\nProf. Hull, _Geol. Mag. for 1874_, p. 205. Jukes (_Student's Manual\r\nof Geology_, 2nd edit. 1862, p. 325) gave subsequently an excellent\r\nepitome of the volcanic history. The microscopic structure of some of\r\nthe Limerick volcanic rocks has been described by Mr. Allport, _Quart.\r\nJourn. Geol. Soc._ vol. xxx. (1874), p. 552, and by Prof. Hull, _Geol.\r\nMag. for 1873_, p. 153. See also Mr. Watts' account of these rocks in\r\nthe _Guide to the Collections of Rocks and Fossils_ (Dublin, 1895), p.\r\n93.]\r\n\r\nThe lower volcanic group, which forms a complete ring round the Upper\r\nLimestones of the Limerick basin, is estimated to reach a thickness of\r\n1000 feet in some parts of its course.[74] Its base appears to coincide\r\ngenerally with the upward termination of the Lower Limestone group of\r\nthis district, though here and there small patches of volcanic rocks in\r\nthat group have been regarded as interstratified and contemporaneous\r\nbands.[75] It consists of a series of lavas and tuffs, the alternations\r\nand rapid incoming and dying out of which were well made out by the\r\nGeological Survey.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: Explanation of Sheet 144, p. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: Some of them, however, have characters that rather seem to\r\nplace them with the intrusive materials of the district, and therefore\r\nnot necessarily earlier than the bedded lavas and tuffs. The boundary\r\nline of the volcanic series is not consistently followed along the\r\nsame horizon on the Survey maps. Thus to the east of Caherconlish, a\r\nstrip of the Upper Limestone is inserted below the base of the tuffs\r\nfor a distance of about four miles. Unless a different horizon has\r\nbeen in some places taken for the boundary between the two groups of\r\nlimestones, it would appear that the eruptions had not extended over\r\nthe north and north-east of the district until some time after the\r\ndeposition of the Upper Limestone had begun. The division between the\r\ntwo limestone groups is taken at a set of chert-bands, but as these are\r\nnot constant it is sometimes difficult to draw a satisfactory line of\r\ndivision.]\r\n\r\n_Tuffs._--The base of the volcanic series is generally formed by a band\r\nof tuff sometimes as much as 350 feet thick,[76] which may be traced\r\nnearly continuously round the basin as well as in detached outliers\r\neven as far as Carrigogunnel overlooking the alluvial plain of the\r\nShannon. The manner in which the bottom of this tuff is interstratified\r\nwith the limestone below it may be instructively examined in many\r\nquarries around the town of Limerick. Striking evidence is there\r\nsupplied that the first eruptions were comparatively feeble and\r\nspasmodic, and were separated by intervals of longer and shorter\r\nduration, during which the limestone with its fragmentary organisms\r\nwas deposited, little or no volcanic detritus falling at that time.\r\nYet even in some of the limestones the microscope reveals fine broken\r\nneedles of felspar, representing doubtless the finest ejected dust.[77]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: Explanation of Sheet 154, p. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: For the details of the microscopic structure of the\r\nLimerick volcanic rocks I am mainly indebted to the examination of them\r\nmade for me by my Survey colleague, Mr. W. W. Watts.]\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the way in which the volcanic and organic\r\ndetritus alternated over the sea-floor, the following section from a\r\nquarry in the townland of Loch Gur on the southern side of the basin is\r\nhere given:[78]--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Explanation of Sheet 154, pp. 21, 22.]\r\n\r\n  Cherty limestone more than                  20 feet 0 in.\r\n  Decomposed green tuff                        2  \"   6  \"\r\n  Bluish-green, calcareous laminated tuff      4  \"   0  \"\r\n  Limestone, slightly ashy                     1  \"   8  \"\r\n  Green tuff                                   0  \"   2  \"\r\n  Fine-grained decomposed tuff                 0  \"   4  \"\r\n  Green tuff, obliquely laminated              1  \"   7  \"\r\n  Fine laminated tuff                          0  \"   8  \"\r\n  Green compact tuff                           1  \"   8  \"\r\n  Obliquely laminated shaly tuff               0  \"  10  \"\r\n  Concretionary ashy limestone                 1  \"   4  \"\r\n  Compact ashy limestone                       2  \"   0  \"\r\n  Green shaly tuff, much weathered             0  \"   5  \"\r\n  Ashy limestone                               0  \"   7  \"\r\n  Compact green tuff more than                 4  \"   0  \"\r\n                                             --------------\r\n                                              41 feet 9 in.\r\n\r\nThe tuffs which in the southern part of the basin underlie the less\r\nbasic lavas differ in some respects from those which further north\r\nare associated with the Upper Limestones. They are green, sometimes\r\ndull purplish-red, finely granular rocks, made up in large part of\r\nandesitic debris. They are full of loose felspar crystals, minute,\r\nsomewhat rounded and subangular lapilli of andesite or some less basic\r\nlava, together with bits of grit and baked shale. Though generally\r\nmuch decomposed, they are sometimes compact enough to be used for\r\nbuilding-stone. Under the microscope these tuffs are seen to abound in\r\nandesite-lapilli, with a few pieces of felsitic rocks enclosed in an\r\nopaque base, through which are scattered broken felspars and occasional\r\nvesicular lapilli.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 193.--Section in quarry on roadside east of\r\nLimerick close to viaduct of the Limerick and Erris Railway.\r\n\r\n1. Limestone; 2. Calcareous tuff; 3. Ashy limestone or calcareous tuff.]\r\n\r\nThe tuffs around Limerick, interbedded with the Black (Upper)\r\nLimestone, are distinguished by a scarcity of andesitic debris, by\r\ntheir persistent dull greenish-grey colour, and more particularly\r\nby the abundance of minute lapilli and larger fragments of an\r\nepidote-green, finely vesicular, easily sectile basic pumice. Under\r\nthe microscope much of this material is found to be an altered basic\r\nglass of the nature of palagonite. These tuffs are in evident relation\r\nwith the more basic lavas that accompany them. The manner in which they\r\nalternate with the black limestone shows that the conditions for the\r\neruption of this more basic detritus continued to be very similar to\r\nthose that existed when the andesitic tuffs were ejected. As a good\r\nillustration of this feature the accompanying section (Fig. 193) is\r\ngiven from a quarry on the side of the high-road between Limerick and\r\nAnnacotty. The total depth of strata here represented is about 15 feet.\r\nThe black limestone at the bottom is a tolerably pure calcareous rock.\r\nIt is divided into bands by thin partings of a fine greenish calcareous\r\ntuff, each marking a brief discharge of ashes from some neighbouring\r\nvent. Half-way up the succession of strata, the ashy material rapidly\r\nincreases until it usurps the place of the limestone, though its\r\ncalcareous composition shows that the accumulation of calcareous\r\nsediment had not been entirely suspended during the eruption of ash.\r\n\r\nAmong these tuffs I have noticed fragments of fine, dark, flinty\r\nfelsite, grit and other rocks. The stones are for the most part small,\r\nbut vary up to blocks occasionally a foot in diameter.\r\n\r\n_Lavas._--The lavas occur in numerous sheets, sometimes separated by\r\nthin partings or thicker beds of tuff and volcanic conglomerate. On the\r\nnorthern rim of the basin Mr. G. H. Kinahan has described the volcanic\r\nseries east of Shehan's Cross-roads as composed of six zones of tuff,\r\neach bed varying from about 50 to 250 feet in thickness, alternating\r\nwith as many sheets of lava ranging from 27 to 180 feet in thickness,\r\nthe total depth of tuff being estimated at nearly 500 feet and that\r\nof the lavas at about 800 feet.[79] Some of these tuffs are coarse\r\nconglomerates or agglomerates, with blocks of lava occasionally 10 feet\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Explanation of Sheet 144, p. 28.]\r\n\r\nSome of the lavas in the lower volcanic group are andesites quite like\r\nthose of the plateau series in the Carboniferous system of Scotland.\r\nExternally they appear as dull reddish-brown or purplish-red compact\r\nrocks, with abundant porphyritic felspars scattered through the\r\nfine-grained base. They are generally much decomposed, showing on a\r\nfresh fracture pseudomorphs of chlorite, hæmatite and calcite after\r\nsome of the minerals, with abundant hæmatitic staining through the body\r\nof the rock. Amygdaloidal structure is commonly developed.\r\n\r\nThese andesites, when examined microscopically, were found by Mr.\r\nWatts to present the characteristic base of minute felspar-laths with\r\nmagnetite and enstatite, and with porphyritic crystals, often large, of\r\nzoned plagioclase, as well as of ilmenite and hæmatite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 194.--Section of the volcanic escarpment, east of\r\nShehan's Cross-roads, south of Limerick.\r\n\r\n1. Limestone; 2 2. Tuffs; 3 3. Lavas.]\r\n\r\nBut besides the andesites there occur also, and, so far as I have\r\nobserved, in larger number, sheets of true basalt. This rock is\r\ntypically black, exceedingly close-grained in the central portion of\r\neach sheet, but becoming highly slaggy and vesicular along the upper\r\nand lower parts. Under the microscope it is found to contain granular\r\naugite and magnetite, set in a more or less devitrified glass, with\r\nmicrolites of felspar, porphyritic plagioclase, serpentinized olivine,\r\nand some well-marked augite. These rocks form distinct escarpments\r\nalong the northern rim of the basin as in the foregoing section east\r\nfrom Shehan's Cross-roads (Fig. 194). From the summit of this ridge,\r\nwhich is about 600 feet above the sea, the eye looks northward over the\r\nplain, across which low outliers of the volcanic series are scattered,\r\nand southwards across the basin to the corresponding line of volcanic\r\nheights forming the southern rim.\r\n\r\nThe upper volcanic group has been estimated by the officers of the\r\nGeological Survey to lie about 1000 feet higher in the Carboniferous\r\nsystem than the lower, the intervening strata consisting of the Upper\r\nLimestone.[80] It is possible that the interval is greater in some parts\r\nof the district than in others, and if so, the difference may be due\r\neither to greater local accumulation of volcanic materials, or to local\r\nprolongation of the eruptions into higher stratigraphical horizons. The\r\noutcrop of the upper volcanic band forms about half of a ring round the\r\nlittle cup of Millstone Grit or Coal-measures which lies within the\r\nvolcanic basin. On the north-west side of the cup the volcanic rocks\r\ndisappear. Hence the upper band has a much more restricted area than\r\nthe lower. But if the tuffs immediately around Limerick are assigned\r\nto the upper group, its extent will be proportionately increased.\r\nThere can be little doubt, however, that neither in thickness nor in\r\nsuperficial area did the lavas and tuffs of the second group equal\r\nthose of the first. The volcanic energy was gradually dying out.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: Explanation of Sheet 154, p. 24.]\r\n\r\nThe lavas of the second period are characteristic dull, black, compact\r\nbasalts, like those of the first period, becoming here and there\r\nstrongly amygdaloidal, and being occasionally separated by slaggy or\r\nconglomeratic partings. But they include also certain rocks wherein\r\nthe felspar diminishes in quantity, while augite and olivine become\r\nconspicuous, together with a little enstatite. The augite occurs in\r\nlarge porphyritic forms, as well as of medium size and in small prisms.\r\nThe olivine, as usual, is now in the condition of serpentine. These\r\nrocks are more basic than the ordinary basalts, containing only 38·66\r\nper cent of silica, and thus approaching the limburgites. With these\r\nbasic lavas are associated dull green tuffs and conglomerates, made\r\nup largely of basalt-debris, together with abundant pieces of finely\r\nvesicular basic pumice and lapilli of a palagonitic material.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the lavas and tuffs have alternated with each\r\nother, and also with the limestones, is well seen on Nicker Hill\r\nabove Pallas Grean.[81] The Survey sections show eight sheets of lava,\r\nseparated by six bands of tuff and eight intercalations of limestone,\r\nthe whole passing under the Coal-measures.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: See Explanation of Sheet 144, p. 30, where a description\r\nwith detailed map and sections of this ground will be found.]\r\n\r\nThe upper volcanic group may be as much as 600 or 800 feet thick. It\r\nappears to have been left, at the close of the eruptions, with a very\r\nuneven surface, some portions being so low as to be overspread with the\r\nUpper Limestones, other parts so high as not to be covered until the\r\nCoal-measure shales and flagstones came to be deposited.[82]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: Explanation of Sheet 154, pp. 24, 35.]\r\n\r\n_Vents._--All round the edges of the Limerick basin, where the\r\nescarpments of the volcanic groups, rising abruptly above the plain,\r\nshow that these rocks once extended beyond their present limits, the\r\nprogress of denudation has revealed a number of bosses which, as above\r\nstated, Jukes and his associates looked upon as marking some of the\r\nvents from which the lavas and tuffs were erupted. Especially striking\r\nis the line of these vents along the southern margin. The rocks now\r\nfilling them present some unusual and rather anomalous features. They\r\nare decidedly more acid than the lavas of the basin, some of them even\r\ncontaining free quartz. Mr. Watts remarks that \"though they have a good\r\ndeal in common with the trachytes, they are crystalline throughout.\r\nThey are red granite-looking rocks, which are made up chiefly of\r\nstumpy idiomorphic prisms of felspar which is mainly orthoclase.\r\nSome plagioclase also occurs, and the two felspars are imbedded in\r\ninterstitial quartz. A trace of hornblende or mica is frequently\r\npresent, and the rocks contain about 65 per cent of silica.\" These\r\ncharacters are specially observable in the necks furthest removed from\r\nthe basin, which may possibly have been connected with the andesitic\r\noutflows. Nearer to the basin the necks \"contain about 60 per cent\r\nof silica, seldom show any interstitial quartz, and stand between\r\ntrachytes and porphyrites, some perhaps being bostonites.\"[83]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: _Guide to the Collections of Rocks, etc., Geol. Survey,\r\nIreland_, p. 93, Dublin 1895.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 195.--View of Derk Hill, a volcanic neck on the\r\nsouth side of the Limerick basin.]\r\n\r\nA geologist, familiar with the Carboniferous and Permian necks of\r\nScotland, has no hesitation in confirming the surmise of Jukes and\r\nhis colleagues that the cones and domes around the Limerick basin\r\nmark the sites of eruptive vents. On the south side of the basin, at\r\nleast nine such necks rise into view, partly from among the lavas and\r\ntuffs, but chiefly through the limestones that emerge from below\r\nthese volcanic sheets. One of the most conspicuous of them, Derk Hill\r\n(Fig. 195), rises to a height of 781 feet above the sea, and comes\r\nthrough the bedded andesites, as represented in Fig. 196, which gives,\r\nin diagrammatic form, the general structure of the Limerick volcanic\r\nbasin. Around the northern side of the basin a smaller number of necks\r\nhas been observed, consisting of similar acid rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 196.--Section across the Limerick volcanic basin.\r\n\r\n1. Lower limestone; 2. Lower series of lavas and tuffs; 3. Middle and\r\nUpper Limestone; 4. Upper series of lavas and tuffs; 5 5. Two volcanic\r\nnecks; 6. Millstone Grit series.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA few of the necks appear to be filled with volcanic agglomerate. Here\r\nand there detached patches of fragmental volcanic material have been\r\nshown on the Survey maps, and referred to in the Explanations, as\r\nif they were outliers of the bedded tuffs; though in some cases the\r\ncoarseness of their materials and the want of any distinct bedding,\r\ntogether with the absence of any indication of their relation to the\r\nnearest limestones, have evidently offered considerable difficulty in\r\ntheir mapping. One of the best examples occurs about two miles to the\r\nsouth-east of the village of Oola. The boundaries of this patch, as put\r\non the map, are confessed to be \"entirely speculative.\" It was only\r\nseen on the side of the railway where it appeared as \"a very coarse\r\nbrecciated purple ash.\"[84]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: Explanation of Sheet 154, p. 25.]\r\n\r\nOn comparing the maps of the Limerick basin with those of the\r\nCarboniferous districts of Scotland, the main difference will probably\r\nbe acknowledged to be the absence of any recognizable sills in the\r\nIrish ground. That no sills actually occur, I am not prepared to\r\naffirm. Indeed some of the more acid rocks, both outside the basin and\r\namong the rocks of the older volcanic group, appeared to me during\r\nmy traverses of the ground to have much of the character of sills.\r\nA more critical examination of the area would not improbably detect\r\nsome truly intrusive sheets which have hitherto been mapped among the\r\ninterstratified lavas. Some appear to exist among the surrounding Lower\r\nLimestones.\r\n\r\nAn intrusive mass, like a sill or dyke, is represented on the\r\nGeological Survey Map as traversing the Coal-measures in the inner\r\nbasin south of Ballybrood. But as the strata are on end along its\r\nsouthern margin, it may possibly be only a portion of the upper\r\nvolcanic series which has been thrown into its present position by one\r\nor more faults.[85]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: Sheet 154 and Explanation to the same, p. 24.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE VOLCANIC BRECCIAS OF DOUBTFUL AGE IN COUNTY CORK\r\n\r\nIn the south-western headlands of Ireland, from Bear Island to\r\nDursey Island, various igneous rocks have been traced on the maps\r\nof the Geological Survey. They have been described as consisting of\r\n\"greenstone,\" \"felstone,\" and \"ash\" or \"breccia,\" and as including\r\nboth interstratified and intrusive masses.[86] If contemporaneous with\r\nthe strata in which they occur, they would prove the existence of a\r\ngroup of volcanic rocks in the Carboniferous slate, or lowest division\r\nof the Carboniferous system. After an examination of the coast-line\r\nI came to the conclusion that while there is undoubtedly evidence of\r\nformer volcanic activity in this part of Ireland, no proof has been\r\nobtained that the eruptions occurred in the Carboniferous period. The\r\nfelsites and dolerites appeared to me to be all intrusive, the former\r\nhaving certainly been injected before the terrestrial movements that\r\nhave disturbed the rocks, for some of them share very markedly in the\r\ncleavage of the region. The dolerites and diabases, on the other hand,\r\nso far as I observed, are not cleaved, and are thus probably of later\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: See Sheets 197 and 198 of the Geological Survey of\r\nIreland, and the Explanation of these Sheets by Messrs. Jukes, Kinahan,\r\nWilson, and O'Kelly, 1860.]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting rocks are undoubtedly the \"ash\" and \"breccia,\" for\r\nthey are obviously of volcanic as distinguished from plutonic origin.\r\nOn the coast north of White Bull Head, a bed of volcanic breccia may be\r\nseen made up of rounded and angular fragments of different sandstones,\r\nshales and limestones, with pieces of felsite and andesite wrapped up\r\nin a dull-grey fine-grained sandy felspathic matrix. The rock weathers\r\nwith a rough or rugged surface, owing to the dropping out of the more\r\ndecomposable stones. This bed, about five feet thick, runs with the\r\nbedding of the strata around it, and like these dips S.S.W. at an\r\nangle of 70°. If no other evidence were obtainable, this breccia would\r\nbe naturally set down as a truly interstratified deposit of volcanic\r\ndetritus. A short distance from it, a second, rather thicker band of\r\nsimilar material occurs, specially distinguished by its abundant worn\r\ncrystals of hornblende, sometimes three inches in diameter, as well as\r\nlarge crystals of muscovite. These minerals are not unknown elsewhere\r\nin volcanic agglomerates. The occurrence of lumps of augite in the\r\nvents of Upper Old Red Sandstone age in Caithness has been already\r\nalluded to, and a still larger series of ejected minerals will be\r\nshown in a later chapter to characterize the younger necks of Central\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nIn parts of its course, this second band appears to run so perfectly\r\nparallel with the bedding of the strata between which it lies that the\r\nobserver would readily believe it to be a part of the same series of\r\ndeposits, and might therefore regard it as affording good evidence of\r\nvolcanic action contemporaneous with the formation of these deposits.\r\nA transverse section of the bed, where thus apparently conformable, is\r\nshown in Fig. 197.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 197.--Section of a bed of Volcanic Breccia in the\r\nCarboniferous Slate; White Bull Head, County Cork.\r\n\r\n1 1. Sandstones and shales; 2. Breccia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 198.--Volcanic Breccia invading and enclosing\r\nCarboniferous Slate, White Bull Head.]\r\n\r\nFurther examination, however,reveals that this seemingly regular\r\nsequence is entirely deceptive. At various points the breccia abruptly\r\ntruncates the sandstones, and involves large pieces of them, as shown\r\nin Fig. 198 A. At other places, the lower side of the breccia, or what\r\nwould be its base if it were a regular bed, cuts out the strata and\r\nsends veins into them (B). And the same structure is visible, on its\r\nupper side, or what would be its top (C).\r\n\r\nIt is clear that these highly-inclined bands of breccia are not\r\ncontemporaneous with the deposition of the Carboniferous Slate, but\r\nhave been introduced into their position at some time subsequent\r\nnot only to the deposition, but to the disturbance and elevation of\r\nthe strata. The peninsula of White Bull Head is crossed by several\r\nother similar bands. On Black Bull Head, also, together with abundant\r\nfelsitic and doleritic intrusions, a similar breccia or agglomerate\r\nis to be seen. In some parts it is compact in texture with spheroidal\r\nflinty lumps, and weathers somewhat like a nodular felsite. This\r\nvariety ends off rather abruptly to the north, but swells out\r\nsouthward, and then runs out into a high, narrow headland, in which\r\nit contains asbestos, as well as rounded crystals of hornblende. It\r\nhas here disrupted the shales and sandstones, and near the junction\r\nis largely composed of fragments of them, the strata themselves being\r\njumbled, bent, and broken up.\r\n\r\nThe only semblance of a neck-like mass of this volcanic fragmental\r\nmaterial occurs on White Bull Head, where one of the bands expands\r\nabout the centre of the ridge, and is there full of large blocks of\r\ngrey sandstone. The breccia appears to have filled fissures which have\r\nbeen opened between the bedding planes of the highly tilted strata,\r\ngiving rise to long narrow dyke-like intercalations. We have seen that\r\namong the Carboniferous volcanic phenomena such dyke-like masses of\r\nagglomerate occasionally present themselves in the vents both of the\r\nplateaux and the puys.\r\n\r\nIn one or two places I noticed what may be traces of cleavage in\r\nthe breccia. The rock is not one that would yield easily to the\r\nrearrangements required for the production of this structure, and the\r\ndoubtful cleavage may be deceptive. If we are justified in regarding\r\nthe introduction of this volcanic material as having necessarily taken\r\nplace after the tilting of the strata, we may not unreasonably infer\r\nfurther that the eruptions could only have been effected at no great\r\ndistance from the surface. But the Carboniferous Slate in which these\r\nagglomerates lie is the lowest member of the Carboniferous system. As\r\nthere is no known unconformability throughout this system in the south\r\nof Ireland, the whole of the rest of the pile of Carboniferous strata,\r\namounting to a depth of several thousand feet, once probably extended\r\nover this region. It must, therefore, have been not only after the\r\nplication, but after extensive denudation of the formations that the\r\nfissures were filled with agglomerate. These geological changes no\r\ndoubt occupied a vast period of time. While, therefore, no positive\r\nevidence has yet been gathered to fix the age of these volcanic\r\neruptions of the south-west of Ireland, it is tolerably clear that they\r\ncannot be assigned to the Carboniferous period, but must belong to some\r\nlater volcanic epoch. They may be of Permian age, perhaps even as late\r\nas the Tertiary volcanic series.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK VII\r\n\r\n                         THE PERMIAN VOLCANOES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n                   THE PERMIAN VOLCANOES OF SCOTLAND\r\n\r\n  Geographical Changes at the Close of the Carboniferous\r\n  Period--Land- and Inland-Seas of Permian time--General\r\n  Characteristics and Nature of the Materials erupted--Structure of\r\n  the several Volcanic Districts: 1. Ayrshire, Nithsdale, Annandale;\r\n  2. Basin of the Firth of Forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe close of the Carboniferous portion of the geological record in\r\nBritain is marked by another of those great gaps which so seriously\r\naffect the continuity of geological history. No transitional formation,\r\nsuch as in other countries marks the gradation from the Carboniferous\r\ninto the succeeding period, has been definitely recognized in this\r\ncountry. The highest Carboniferous strata are here separated from all\r\nyounger deposits by an unconformability, indicating the lapse of vast\r\nperiods of time whereof, within the British area, no chronicle has been\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nWhen we pass from the Carboniferous system to that which comes next\r\nto it in order of time, we soon become sensible that great changes in\r\ngeography, betokening an immense interval, took place between them. The\r\nprolonged subsidence during which the Coal-measures were accumulated,\r\nnot only carried down below sea-level all the tracts over which the\r\nCarboniferous system was deposited, but possibly submerged the last\r\nof the islets, which, like those of Charnwood Forest, had survived so\r\nmany geological changes. Eventually, however, and after what may have\r\nbeen a vast period of quiescence, underground movements began anew, and\r\nthe tracts of Coal-measures were unequally ridged up into land. The\r\ntopography thus produced appears to have resulted in the formation of\r\na series of inland seas somewhat like those of the Old Red Sandstone,\r\nbut probably less in area and in depth. In these basins the water seems\r\nto have been on the whole unfavourable to life, for the red sand and\r\nmud deposited in them are generally unfossiliferous, though, when\r\nthe conditions became more suitable, calcareous or dolomitic sediment\r\naccumulated on the bottom, to form what is now known as the \"Magnesian\r\nLimestone,\" and muddy sediment was deposited which is now the \"Marl\r\nSlate.\" In these less ferruginous strata, betokening a less noxious\r\ncondition of water, various marine organisms are met with.[87]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: In some recent borings around Hartlepool the Magnesian\r\nLimestone has been found to be interstratified with thick bands of\r\ngypsum and anhydrite, and to be overlain by more than 250 feet of the\r\nlatter substance. Nothing could show more forcibly the exceedingly\r\nsaline and insalubrious character of the Permian lakes or inland seas.]\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of the land surrounding these basins was still\r\nessentially Palæozoic in character. It presented a general resemblance\r\nto that of Carboniferous time, but with some notable differences. The\r\njungles of _Sigillaria_ seem to have disappeared, while on the other\r\nhand, conifers increased in number and variety. The sediments of the\r\nwater-basins have handed down only a scanty remnant of the animal\r\nlife of the time. Along the sandy shores walked various amphibians\r\nwhich have left their footprints on the sand. A few genera of ganoid\r\nfishes have been found in some of the shales, and a comparatively\r\npoor assemblage of crinoids and molluscs has been obtained from the\r\nMagnesian Limestone. To the geological period distinguished by these\r\ngeographical and biological characters the name of Permian is assigned.\r\n\r\nIn his survey of the progress of volcanic history in the area of\r\nBritain, the geologist finds that the long period of quiescence\r\nindicated by the deposition of the Coal-measures, and probably also\r\nby the unconformability between the Coal-measures and the Permian\r\nformations, was at length terminated by a renewed volcanic outbreak,\r\nbut on a singularly diminished scale and for a comparatively brief\r\nperiod of time. Whether, had the Permo-Carboniferous strata which\r\nconnect the Coal-measures with the Permian formations on the Continent\r\nbeen found in this country, they would have filled up the gap in the\r\ngeological record, and would have supplied any trace of contemporaneous\r\nvolcanic action, cannot even be surmised. All that we know is that,\r\nafter a vast interval, and during the deposition of the breccias and\r\nred sandstones which unconformably overlie the Coal-measures, a few\r\nscattered groups of little volcanoes appeared in the area of the\r\nBritish Isles.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that in those districts where these volcanic\r\nrelics have been preserved, the stratigraphical record is singularly\r\nimperfect, and that on the eastern side of England, where this record\r\nis tolerably complete, there are no intercalated volcanic rocks. The\r\nlatter occur in tracts where the strata are almost wholly destitute of\r\nfossils, and where therefore no palæontological evidence is available\r\ndefinitely to fix the geological age of the eruptions. Nevertheless\r\nthere is usually ample proof that the strata in question are much\r\nlater than the Coal-measures, while their geological position and\r\nlithological characters link them with the undoubted Permian series of\r\nthe north-east of England. They may, however, belong to a comparatively\r\nlate part of the Permian period, if indeed some of them may not be\r\nreferable to the succeeding or Triassic period.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively feeble and short-lived volcanoes now to be described\r\nare found in two regions wide apart from each other. The more important\r\nof these lies in the south-west and centre of Scotland. A second\r\ngroup rose in Devonshire. It is possible that a third group appeared\r\nbetween these two regions, somewhere in the midlands. The evidence for\r\nthe history of each area will be given in a separate section in the\r\nfollowing pages.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS--NATURE OF MATERIALS ERUPTED\r\n\r\nThe chief district for the display of volcanic eruptions that may be\r\nassigned to the Permian period lies in the centre of Ayrshire and the\r\nvalleys of the Nith and Annan. But, for reasons stated below, I shall\r\ninclude within the same volcanic province a large part of the eastern\r\nhalf of the basin of the Firth of Forth (see Map V.).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the interesting volcanic rocks now to be considered\r\nhave suffered severely from the effects of denudation. They have been\r\nentirely removed from wide tracts over which they almost certainly\r\nonce extended. But this enormous waste has not been wholly without\r\ncompensations. The lavas and tuffs ejected at the surface, and once\r\nwidely spread over it, during the deposition of the red sandstones,\r\nhave been reduced to merely a few detached fragments. But, on the other\r\nhand, their removal as a superficial covering has revealed the vents of\r\ndischarge to an extent unequalled in any older geological system, even\r\namong the puys of the Carboniferous period. The Permian rocks, escaping\r\nthe effects of those great earth-movements which dislocated, plicated\r\nand buried the older Palæozoic systems of deposits, still remain for\r\nthe most part approximately horizontal or only gently inclined. They\r\nhave thus been more liable to complete removal from wide tracts of\r\ncountry than older formations which have been protected by having large\r\nportions of their mass carried down by extensive faults and synclinal\r\nfolds, and by being buried under later sedimentary accumulations. We\r\nought not, therefore, to judge of the extent of the volcanic discharges\r\nduring Permian time merely from the small patches of lava and tuff\r\nwhich have survived in one or two districts, but rather from the\r\nnumber, size and distribution of the vents which the work of denudation\r\nhas laid bare.\r\n\r\nThe evidence for the geological age of the volcanic series now to be\r\ndescribed is less direct and obvious than most of that with which I\r\nhave been hitherto dealing. It consists of two kinds. (_a_) In the\r\nfirst of these comes the series of lavas and tuffs just referred to\r\nas regularly interstratified with the red sandstones, which, on the\r\ngrounds given in the next paragraph, it is agreed to regard as Permian.\r\n(_b_) Connected with these rocks are necks which obviously served as\r\nvents for the discharge of the volcanic materials. They pierce not only\r\nthe Coal-measures, but even parts of the overlying bedded lavas. So\r\nfar there is not much room for difference of opinion; but as we recede\r\nnorthward from Ayrshire and Nithsdale, where the intercalation of\r\nthe volcanic series in the red sandstones is well displayed, we enter\r\nextensive tracts where these interstratified rocks have disappeared and\r\nonly the necks remain. All that can be positively asserted regarding\r\nthe age of these necks is that they must be later than the rocks\r\nwhich they pierce. But we may inferentially connect them with the\r\ninterstratified lavas and tuffs by showing that they can be followed\r\ncontinuously outward from the latter as one prolonged group, having the\r\nsame distribution, structure and composition, and that here and there\r\nthey rise through the very highest part of the Coal-measures. It is\r\nby reasoning of this kind that I include, as not improbably relics of\r\nPermian volcanoes, a large number of vents scattered over the centre of\r\nScotland, in the East of Fife.\r\n\r\nThe red sandstones among which the volcanic series is intercalated\r\ncover several detached areas in Ayrshire and Dumfriesshire.\r\nLithologically they present a close resemblance to the Penrith\r\nsandstone and breccias of Cumberland, the Permian age of which is\r\ngenerally admitted. They lie unconformably sometimes on Lower and Upper\r\nSilurian rocks, sometimes on the lower parts of the Carboniferous\r\nsystem, and sometimes on the red sandstones which form the highest\r\nsubdivision of that system. They are thus not only younger than the\r\nlatest Carboniferous strata, but are separated from them by the\r\ninterval represented by the unconformability. On these grounds they are\r\nnaturally looked upon as not older than the Permian period. The only\r\npalæontological evidence yet obtained from them in Scotland is that\r\nfurnished by the well-known footprints of Annandale, which indicate the\r\nexistence of early forms of amphibians or reptiles during the time of\r\nthe deposition of the red sand. The precise zoological grade of these\r\nanimals, however, has never yet been determined, so that they furnish\r\nlittle help towards fixing the stratigraphical position of the red\r\nrocks in which the footprints occur.\r\n\r\nThe stratigraphical relations of the red sandstones of Ayrshire\r\nand Nithsdale were discussed by Murchison, Binney and Harkness.[88]\r\nThese observers noticed certain igneous rocks near the base of the\r\nsandstones, to which, however, as being supposed intrusive masses, they\r\ndid not attach importance. They regarded the volcanic tuffs of the\r\nsame district as ordinary breccias, which they classed with those of\r\nDumfries and Cumberland, though Binney noticed the resemblance of their\r\ncementing paste to that of volcanic tuff, and in the end was doubtful\r\nwhether to regard the igneous rocks as intrusive or interstratified.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: See Murchison's _Siluria_, 4th edit. p. 331; _Quart.\r\nJourn. Geol. Soc._ vol. vii. (1851), p. 163, note; vol. xii. (1856), p.\r\n267; Binney, _ibid._ vol. xii. (1856), p. 138; vol. xviii. (1862), p.\r\n437; Harkness, _ibid._ vol. xii. (1856), p. 262.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1862, on visiting the sections in the River Ayr, I\r\nrecognized the breccia as a true volcanic tuff. During the following\r\nyears, while mapping the district for the Geological Survey, I\r\nestablished the existence of a series of contemporaneous lavas and\r\ntuffs at the base of the Permian basin of Ayrshire, and of numerous\r\nnecks marking the vents from which these materials had been erupted.\r\nAn account of these observations was published in the year 1866.[89]\r\nSince that time the progress of the Survey has extended the detailed\r\nmapping into Nithsdale and Annandale, but without adding any new facts\r\nof importance to the evidence furnished by the Ayrshire tract.[90]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: _Geol. Mag. for 1866_, p. 243; and Murchison's _Siluria_,\r\n4th edit. (1867), p. 332.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: The rocks are shown in Sheets 9, 14 and 15 of the\r\nGeological Survey of Scotland, to which, and their accompanying\r\nExplanations, reference is made. The Ayrshire basin was mapped by\r\nme, the necks in the Dalmellington ground by Mr. James Geikie, the\r\nNithsdale area by Mr. R. L. Jack, Mr. H. Skae and myself.]\r\n\r\nThe materials erupted by the Scottish Permian volcanoes display a very\r\nlimited petrographical range, contrasting strongly in this respect with\r\nthe ejections of all the previous geological periods. They consist\r\nof lavas generally more or less basic, and often much decayed at the\r\nsurface; and of agglomerates and tuffs derived from the explosion of\r\nthe same lavas.\r\n\r\nThe lavas are dull reddish or purplish-grey to brown or almost black\r\nrocks; sometimes compact and porphyritic, but more usually strongly\r\namygdaloidal, the vesicles have been filled up with calcite, zeolites\r\nor other infiltration. The porphyritic minerals are in large measure\r\ndull red earthy pseudomorphs of hæmatite, in many cases after\r\nolivine. These rocks have not yet been fully studied in regard to\r\ntheir composition and microscopic structure. A few slides, prepared\r\nfrom specimens collected in Ayrshire and Nithsdale, examined by Dr.\r\nHatch, were found to present remarkably basic characters. One from\r\nMauchline Hill is a picrite, composed chiefly of olivine and augite,\r\nwith a little striped felspar. Others from the Thornhill basin in\r\nDumfriesshire show an absence of olivine, and sometimes even of\r\naugite. The rock of Morton Castle consists of large crystals of augite\r\nand numerous grains of magnetite in a felspathic groundmass full of\r\nmagnetite. Around Thornhill are magnetite-felspar rocks, composed\r\nsometimes of granular magnetite with interstitial felspar. Throughout\r\nall the rocks there has been a prevalent oxidation of the magnetite,\r\nwith a consequent reddening of the masses.\r\n\r\nThe pyroclastic materials consist of unstratified agglomerates and\r\ntuffs, generally found in necks, and of stratified tuffs, which more or\r\nless mingled with non-volcanic material, especially red sandstone, are\r\nintercalated among the bedded lavas or overlie them, and pass upward\r\ninto the ordinary Permian red sandstones.\r\n\r\nThe agglomerates, though sometimes coarse, never contain such large\r\nblocks as are to be seen among the older Palæozoic volcanic groups.\r\nTheir composition bears reference to that of the bedded lavas\r\nassociated with them, pieces of the various basalts, andesites,\r\netc., which constitute these lavas being recognizable, together with\r\nothers, especially a green, finely-vesicular, palagonitic substance,\r\nwhich has not been detected among the sheets of lava. In general the\r\nagglomerates contain more matrix than blocks, and pass readily into\r\ngravelly tuffs. A series of specimens collected by me from necks which\r\npierce the Dalmellington coal-field has been sliced and examined under\r\nthe microscope by Mr. Watts, who finds it to consist of basic tuffs, in\r\nwhich the lapilli include various types of olivine-basalt, sometimes\r\nglassy, sometimes palagonitic, and occasionally holocrystalline, also\r\npieces of grit, shale and limestone. In one case a crinoid joint\r\ndetached from its matrix was noticed. A specimen from Patna Hill\r\nconsists of \"a clear irregularly cracked aggregate of carbonates and\r\nquartz with hornblende, and its structure reminds one of that of\r\nolivine. The hornblende is in small irregular patches surrounded by the\r\nclear mineral, and is probably a replacement of a pyroxene, perhaps\r\ndiallage.\" If this stone was once an olivine nodule, the agglomerate\r\nmight in this respect be compared with some of the tuffs of the Eifel\r\nso well known for their lumps of olivine.\r\n\r\nThe stratified tuffs are generally more or less gravelly deposits,\r\ncomposed of lapilli varying in size from mere grains up to pea-like\r\nfragments, but with numerous larger stones and occasional blocks of\r\nstill greater dimensions. They often pass into a tough dull compact\r\nmudstone. In colour they are greenish or reddish. They have been\r\nlargely derived from the explosion of lavas generally similar to those\r\nof which fragments occur in the agglomerates. They often contain\r\nnon-volcanic detritus, derived from the blowing up of the rocks through\r\nwhich the vents were opened. Occasionally they include also various\r\nminerals such as pyrope, black mica, sanidine, augite, and others which\r\nappear to have been ejected as loose and often broken crystals. This\r\ncharacter is more fully described in regard to its occurrence among the\r\nnecks of the east part of Fife.\r\n\r\nThe intrusive rocks, probably referable to the same volcanic period,\r\nconsist chiefly of dolerites and basalts which occur as dykes, sills\r\nand bosses, and are more particularly developed in the south-west of\r\nAyrshire.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF THE VOLCANIC DISTRICTS\r\n\r\n1. Ayrshire, Nithsdale and Annandale\r\n\r\n(1) _Interstratified Lavas and Tuffs._--It will be convenient to\r\nconsider first the volcanic chronicle as it has been preserved in\r\nthe south-west and south of Scotland, where the existence of Permian\r\nvolcanoes in Britain was first recognized. The volcanic rocks in the\r\nmiddle of the Ayrshire coal-field rise from under a central basin of\r\nred sandstone, which they completely enclose. Their outcrop at the\r\nsurface varies up to about a mile or rather more in breadth, and forms\r\na pear-shaped ring, measuring about nine miles across at its greatest\r\nwidth (Map V.).[91]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: Mr. Gunn has recently detected among the newest red\r\nsandstones of Arran a small patch of volcanic rocks which may be of\r\nthis age. Mr. A. Macconochie has also found what may be traces of a\r\nsimilar volcanic band below the Permian sandstones of Loch Ryan, in\r\nWigtonshire.]\r\n\r\nThis volcanic ring runs as a tract of higher ground encircling the\r\nhollow in which the Permian red sandstones lie, and forming a marked\r\nchain of heights above the Carboniferous country around. It is built up\r\nof a succession of sheets of different lavas, with occasional partings\r\nof tuff or volcanic breccia, which present their escarpments towards\r\nthe coal-field outside, and dip gently into the basin under the inner\r\ntrough of brick-red sandstones. Good sections of the rocks are exposed\r\nin the ravines of the River Ayr, particularly at Ballochmyle, in the\r\nDippol Burn near Auchinleck House, and in the railway cutting near\r\nMossgiel.\r\n\r\nThat these are true lava-flows, and not intrusive sills, is\r\nsufficiently obvious from their general outward lithological aspect,\r\nsome of them being essentially sheets of slag and scoriæ. Their\r\nupper surfaces may be found with a fine indurated red sand wrapping\r\nround the scoriform lumps and protuberances, and filling in the\r\nrents and interspaces, as in the case of the Old Red Sandstone lavas\r\nalready referred to. As an example of these characteristics, I may\r\ncite the section represented in Fig. 200. At the bottom lies a red\r\nhighly ferruginous and coarsely amygdaloidal basalt (_a_). Over it\r\ncomes a volcanic conglomerate three feet thick, made up of balls of\r\nvesicular lava like that below, wrapped in a brick-red sandy matrix\r\n(_b_). Lenticular bands of sandstone without blocks occur in the\r\nconglomerate, and others lie in hollows of its upper surface (_c_).\r\nThis intercalation of detrital material is followed by another basic\r\nlava (_d_), about six feet thick, highly amygdaloidal in its lower and\r\nupper parts, more compact in the centre. The amygdales and joints are\r\nlargely filled with calcite. The slaggy bottom has caught up and now\r\nencloses some of the red sand of the deposit below. Another lava from\r\nthree to six feet thick next appears (_e_), which is remarkable for its\r\nslaggy structure, and is so decomposed that it crumbles away. Like the\r\nothers it is dull-red and ferruginous and full of calcite. It must have\r\nbeen at the time of its outflow a sheet of rough slag that cracked into\r\nopen fissures. That it was poured out under water is again shown in the\r\nsame interesting way just referred to, by the red sand which has been\r\nwashed into the interspaces between the clinkers and has filled up the\r\nfissures, in which it is stratified horizontally between the walls.\r\nAbove this band, and perhaps passing into it as its slaggy base, lies\r\nanother more compact lava (_f_) like the lower sheets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 199.--General section across the Permian basin of\r\nAyrshire.\r\n\r\n1. Highest group of the Coal-measures; 2. Volcanic tuffs and ashy\r\nbrick-red sandstones; 3. Lavas with interstratified tuffs and brick-red\r\nsandstones; 4. Brick-red Permian sandstones; 5, 5. Necks of volcanic\r\nagglomerate; 6. Boss of dolerite.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the series of lavas, as indicated in the foregoing section,\r\ntraces of the pauses that elapsed between the separate outflows may\r\nbe seen in the form either of layers of red sandstone or of tuff and\r\nvolcanic breccia. Here and there, under the platform of bedded lavas,\r\nthe brick-red sandstone is full of fragments of slag and fine volcanic\r\ndust. But the most abundant accumulation of such detritus is to be\r\nseen at the top of the volcanic series, where it contains the records\r\nof the closing phases of eruption. Thick beds of tuff and volcanic\r\nbreccia occur there, interleaved with seams of red sandstone, like the\r\nchief mass of that rock, into which they gradually pass upward. Yet,\r\neven among the sandstones above the main body of tuff, occasional nests\r\nof volcanic lapilli, and even large bomb-like lumps of slag, point to\r\nintermittent explosions before the volcanoes became finally extinct and\r\nwere buried under the thick mass of red Permian sandstone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 200.--Section of lavas east side of Mauchline Hill.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 201.--Section of the top of the volcanic series\r\nnear Eastside Cottage, Carron Water, Nithsdale.]\r\n\r\nThere is good reason to believe that both the volcanic sheets and\r\nthe red sandstones overlying them, instead of being restricted to an\r\narea of only about 30 square miles, once stretched over the lowlands\r\nof Ayrshire; and not only so, but that they ran down Nithsdale, and\r\nextended into several of its tributary valleys, if indeed, they\r\nwere not continuous across into the valley of the Annan.[92] Traces\r\nof the lavas and tuffs are to be found at intervals over the area\r\nhere indicated. The most important display of them, next to their\r\ndevelopment in Ayrshire, occurs in the vale of the Nith at Thornhill,\r\nwhence they extend continuously up the floor of the Carron Valley\r\nfor six miles. They form here, as in Ayrshire, a band at the base of\r\nthe brick-red sandstones, and consist mainly of bedded lavas with\r\nthe basic characters above referred to. These lavas, however, are\r\nfollowed here by a much thicker development of fragmental volcanic\r\nmaterials. Abundant volcanic detritus is diffused through the overlying\r\nsandstones, sometimes as a gravelly intermixture, sometimes in large\r\nslaggy blocks or bombs, and sometimes in intercalated layers of tuff,\r\nwhile an occasional sheet of one of the dull red lavas may also be\r\ndetected. The final dying-out of the volcanic energy in a series of\r\nintermittent explosions, while the ordinary red sandy sediment was\r\naccumulating, is here also admirably chronicled. As an illustration of\r\nthese features the accompanying section is given (Fig. 201). The last\r\nof the lavas (_a_) presents an uneven surface against which the various\r\nkinds of detritus have been laid down. First comes a coarse volcanic\r\nbreccia (_b_) made up of angular and subangular blocks of different\r\nlavas imbedded in a matrix of red ashy sand. This deposit is succeeded\r\nby a band of dull red tufaceous sandstone, evidently formed of ordinary\r\nred sandy sediment, into which a quantity of volcanic dust and lapilli\r\nfell at the time of its accumulation. Some of the ejected blocks which\r\nlie inclosed in the finer sediment are upwards of a foot in length. A\r\nmore vigorous discharge of fragmental material is shown by the next bed\r\n(_d_), which consists of a coarse nodular tuff, mingled with a little\r\nred sandstone and crowded with blocks of the usual lavas. Beyond the\r\nlocality of this section these tuffs are found to pass up insensibly\r\ninto the ordinary Permian sandstone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: See _Memoirs of Geol. Surv. Scotland_, Sheet 15 (1871), p.\r\n35; Sheet 9 (1877), p. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 202.--Section of two outliers of the Permian\r\nvolcanic series at the foot of Windyhill Burn, Water of Ae,\r\nDumfriesshire.]\r\n\r\nBut we can detect the edges of yet more distant streams of lava\r\nemerging from under the red sandstones and breccias to the east of\r\nthe Nith. On the farther side of the Silurian ridge that forms the\r\neastern boundary of the Nith valley, above which it rises some 700\r\nor 800 feet, there is preserved at the bottom of the valley of the\r\nCapel Water, which flows into Annandale, another small outlier of a\r\nsimilar volcanic band. Three miles to the south-east of it two little\r\nfragments of the volcanic group lie on the sides of a small tributary\r\nof the Water of Ae. Since these may serve as a good illustration of the\r\nextent to which denudation has reduced the area of the Permian volcanic\r\nseries, a section of the locality is here given (Fig. 202). The general\r\nfoundation rocks of the country are the Silurian greywackes and shales\r\nin highly inclined and contorted positions (_a_). Each outlier has, as\r\nits basement material, a volcanic breccia (_bb_) in which, together\r\nwith the usual lava-fragments, are mingled pieces of the surrounding\r\nSilurian strata. In the smaller outlier lying to the north-east, this\r\ndetrital layer is only about one foot thick. It is overlain by a slaggy\r\namygdaloid of the usual character (_cc_), which in the lower outlier is\r\ncovered with boulder clay (_d_). There can be little doubt that these\r\ndetached fragments were once united in a continuous sheet of lava which\r\nfilled the valley of the Water of Ae and that of its tributary. That\r\nthe lava stretched down the Ae valley for some distance is proved by\r\nthe occurrence of another outlier of it two miles below.\r\n\r\nBut there is still additional evidence for the wide extension of these\r\nvolcanic sheets. It appears to be certain that they stretch far to\r\nthe eastward, under the Permian sandstones of the Lochmaben basin of\r\nAnnandale, for breccias largely made up of pieces of the bedded lavas\r\nare found close to the northern edge of the basin on the west side of\r\nthe River Annan. To this remarkable adherence of the lavas and tuffs\r\nto the bottom of the Permian valleys I shall afterwards more specially\r\nrefer.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the whole volcanic group cannot be very accurately\r\ndetermined. It reaches a maximum in the Ayrshire basin, where, at its\r\ngreatest, it probably does not exceed 500 feet, but is generally much\r\nless; while in the Nithsdale and Annandale ground the detached and\r\nmuch denuded areas show a still thinner development.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 203.--The Green Hill, Waterside, Dalmellington,\r\nfrom the south; a tuff-neck of Permian age.]\r\n\r\n(2) _Vents._--One of the most interesting features in this\r\nsouth-western district of Scotland is the admirable way in which the\r\nvolcanic vents of Permian time have been preserved. Their connection\r\nwith the lavas and tuffs can there be so clearly traced that they\r\nserve as a guide in the interpretation of other groups of vents in\r\ndistricts where no such connection now remains. In Ayrshire, the\r\nlower part of the Permian volcanic band is pierced by several small\r\nnecks of agglomerate. There cannot, I think, be any doubt that these\r\nnecks mark the positions of some of the vents from which the later\r\neruptions took place. Immediately beyond them necks of precisely\r\nsimilar character rise through the upper division of the Coal-measures.\r\nThere can be as little hesitation in placing these also among the\r\nPermian vents. And thus step by step we are led away from the central\r\nlavas, through groups of necks preserving still the same features,\r\nexternal and internal, and rising indifferently through rocks of any\r\ngeological age from the Coal-measures backward. Thus, although if we\r\nbegan the investigation at the outer limits of the chain of necks,\r\nwe might well hesitate as to their age, yet, when we can fix their\r\ngeological position in one central area, we are, I think, justified\r\nin classing, as parts of one geologically synchronous series, all the\r\nconnected groups that retain the same general characteristics. It is to\r\ndenudation that we owe their having been laid bare to view; but at the\r\nsame time, denudation has removed the sheet of ejected materials which\r\nmay have originally connected most of these vents together.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, it is most instructive to follow the vents\r\nsouth-eastwards from the Ayrshire basin into Nithsdale for a distance\r\nof some eighteen miles. If we traced them down that valley to Sanquhar,\r\nwithout meeting with any vestige of superficial outflows to mark their\r\nstratigraphical position, we might possibly hesitate whether the age\r\nof those which are so far removed from the evidence that would fix it\r\nshould not be left in doubt. But if we continued our traverse only a\r\nfew hundred yards farther, we should find some fragmentary outliers\r\nof the Permian lavas capping the Upper Coal-measures; and if we merely\r\ncrossed from the Nith into the tributary valley of the Carron Water,\r\nwe should see preserved in that deep hollow a great series of Permian\r\nlavas, tuffs and agglomerates. It is only by a happy accident that here\r\nand there these superficial volcanic accumulations have not been swept\r\naway. There was probably never any great thickness of them, but they no\r\ndoubt covered most, if not all, of the district within which the vents\r\nare found.\r\n\r\nThe Permian necks are, on the whole, smaller than those of the\r\nCarboniferous period. The largest of them in the Ayrshire and Nithsdale\r\nregion do not exceed 4000 feet in longest diameter; the great majority\r\nare much less in size, while the smallest measure 20 yards, or even\r\nless. Those of Fife, to be afterwards described, exhibit a wider range\r\nof dimensions, and have the special advantage of being exposed in plan\r\nalong the shore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 204.--Patna Hill from the Doon Bridge, Ayrshire; a\r\ntuff-neck of Permian age.]\r\n\r\nThese necks, from their number and shapes, form a marked feature in the\r\nscenery. They generally rise as prominent, rounded, dome-shaped, or\r\nconical hills, which, as the rock comes close to the surface, remain\r\npermanently covered with grass (Figs. 203 and 204). Such smooth green\r\npuys are conspicuous in the heart of Ayrshire, and likewise further\r\nsouth in the Dalmellington coal-field, where some of them are locally\r\nknown as \"Green Hill,\" from their verdant slopes in contrast to the\r\nbrowner vegetation of the poorer soil around them (Fig. 203).\r\n\r\nAs in those of older geological periods, the necks of this series\r\nare, for the most part, irregularly circular or oval in ground-plan,\r\nbut sometimes, like those of the Carboniferous system, they take\r\ncurious oblong shapes, and occasionally look as if two vents had\r\ncoalesced (Fig. 205). Here and there also the material of the vents\r\nhas consolidated between the walls of a fissure or the planes of the\r\nstrata, so as to appear rather as a dyke than as a neck. Descending,\r\nas usual, vertically through the rocks which they pierce, the necks\r\nhave the form of vertical columns of volcanic material, ending at the\r\nsurface in grassy rounded hillocks or hills.\r\n\r\nIn almost all cases, the necks of the Ayrshire region consist of a\r\ngravelly tuff or agglomerate, reddish or greenish in colour, made up of\r\nblocks of such lavas as form the bedded sheets, together with fragments\r\nof the stratified rocks through which the chimneys have been blown out.\r\nThus, in some of the necks, pieces of black shale are abundant, as at\r\nPatna. In other cases, there are proofs of the derivation of the stones\r\nfrom much greater depths, as in the Green Hill of Waterside, where\r\nfragments of fine greywacke are not infrequent, probably derived from\r\nthe Silurian formations which lie deep beneath the Carboniferous and\r\nOld Red Sandstone series.\r\n\r\nThe fragmentary material of the necks is generally unstratified, but a\r\nrude stratification may sometimes be noticed, the dip being irregularly\r\ninward at high angles towards the middle of the vent. This structure,\r\nbest seen in the vents of the Fife coast, as will be shown in the\r\nsequel, may be detected in some of the necks of the Dalmellington\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 205.--Ground plans of Permian volcanic vents from\r\nthe Ayrshire Coal-field. On the scale of six inches to a mile.\r\n\r\n  1. Neck half a mile north-west from Dalmellington; 2. Neck at\r\n  Auchengee, four miles north-east from Patna; 3. Neck at head of\r\n  Drumbowie Burn, five and a half miles due north from Dalmellington;\r\n  4. Patna Hill, 853 feet above sea-level (for outline of this hill\r\n  see the preceding Fig.); 5. Neck on Kiers Hill (1005 feet above the\r\n  sea), two miles south from Patna, with lava adhering to part of the\r\n  wall.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOccasionally some form of molten rock has risen in the funnel, and has\r\npartially or wholly removed or concealed the agglomerate. This feature\r\nis especially noticeable among the necks that pierce the Dalmellington\r\ncoal-field. Portions of basic lavas traverse the agglomerate or\r\nintervene between it and the surrounding strata. These have probably in\r\nmost cases been forced up the wall of the funnel, while here and there\r\nsills run outward from the necks into the surrounding Coal-measures.\r\nSometimes a thin sheet of lava, adhering to the wall of a funnel, may\r\nbe the remnant of a mass of rock that once filled up the orifice. In\r\none of the necks of the Muirkirk Coal-field, which was pierced by\r\na mine driven through it from side to side, fingers and sheets of\r\n\"white trap,\" or highly altered basalt, were found to run out from the\r\nneck into the surrounding strata.[93] Dark heavy basalt, or some still\r\nmore basic rock, has here and there filled up a vent. As so many of\r\nthe necks rise through the coal-fields, opportunities are afforded of\r\nstudying the effects of volcanic action upon the coal-seams, which for\r\nsome distance from them have been destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: Explanation of Sheet 23, Geol. Surv. Scotland, p. 39.]\r\n\r\nAnother feature, which can be recognized from the information obtained\r\nin mining operations, is that, in the great majority of instances,\r\nno connection is traceable between the positions of the vents and\r\nsuch lines of dislocation as can be detected at the surface or in the\r\nunderground workings. Some vents, indeed, have evidently had their\r\npositions determined by lines of fault, as, for instance, that of the\r\nGreen Hill below Dalmellington. Yet in the same neighbourhood a number\r\nof other examples may be found where the volcanic funnels seem to have\r\navoided faults, though these exist close to them.\r\n\r\nIn this south-western district of Scotland upwards of sixty distinct\r\nvents have been mapped in the course of the Geological Survey. They run\r\nfrom the north of Ayrshire to the foot of the Southern Uplands, and\r\ndescend for some distance the vale of the Nith. The area over which\r\nthey are distributed measures roughly about forty miles from north-west\r\nto south-east, and at its greatest breadth twenty miles from south-west\r\nto north-east. Within this tract the vents are scattered somewhat\r\nsporadically in groups, sometimes numbering twenty necks in a space of\r\nsixteen square miles, as in the remarkable district of Dalmellington.\r\n\r\nIn considering their distribution we cannot but be impressed by the\r\nstriking manner in which these necks keep to the valleys and low\r\ngrounds. I have already alluded to this characteristic, as shown by the\r\nvolcanoes of the Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous periods. But it\r\nis displayed by the Permian volcanoes in a still more astonishing way.\r\nBeginning at the northern end of the long chain of necks in the West\r\nof Scotland, we find a row of them on the plains fronting the volcanic\r\nplateau of the Ardrossan, Dunlop and Stewarton Hills. Thence we may\r\nfollow them, as single individuals or in small groups, across the broad\r\nlowland of Ayrshire, southward to the very base of the great chain\r\nof the Southern Uplands. There, a cluster of some two dozen of them\r\nmay be seen rising out of the Carboniferous rocks on the low grounds,\r\nbut they abruptly cease close to the base of the hills; not one has\r\nbeen detected on the adjacent Silurian heights. Moreover, if we turn\r\ninto the valleys that lead away from the great Ayrshire plain to the\r\ninterior, we find necks of the same character in these depressions.\r\nThey ascend the valley of Muirkirk, and may be met with even at its\r\nvery head, near the base of the Hagshaw Hills. Again, on the floor\r\nof the remarkable transverse valley trenched by the Nith across the\r\nSouthern Uplands, Permian necks pierce the Coal-measures, while the\r\noutlying fragments of bedded lava show that these vents flooded the\r\nbottom of that valley with molten rock. Turning out of Nithsdale into\r\nthe long narrow glen of the Carron Water, we observe its floor and\r\nsides to be covered with the sheets of lava and tuff already noticed.\r\nAnd so travelling onward from the vale of the Nith into that of the\r\nCapel Water, thence into the Water of Ae and across into the great\r\nstrath of Annandale, we may detect, if not actual vents, at least the\r\nbeds of lava and layers of volcanic detritus that were ejected from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAll along these valleys, which were already valleys in Carboniferous\r\ntime, traces of the volcanic activity of this epoch may be detected.\r\nBut, so far as I am aware, in not a single case has any vent been\r\nobserved to have been opened on the high surrounding ridges. There has\r\nobviously been a determining cause why the volcanic orifices should\r\nhave kept to the plains and the main valleys with their tributaries,\r\nand should have avoided the hills which rise now to heights of 500 to\r\n1000 feet or more above the bottoms of the valleys that traverse them.\r\nIt might be said that the valleys follow lines of fracture, and that\r\nthe vents have been opened along these lines. But my colleagues in the\r\nGeological Survey, as well as myself, have failed, in most cases, to\r\nfind any evidence of such dislocations among the rocks that form the\r\nsurface of the country, while it is sometimes possible to prove that\r\nthey really do not exist there.\r\n\r\nThough only a few scattered patches of the Permian bedded lavas\r\nand tuffs have been preserved, enough is left to indicate that the\r\nvents were active only in the early part of the period represented\r\nby the Scottish Permian red sandstones, for it is entirely in the\r\nlower part of these strata that volcanic rocks occur. The eruptions\r\ngradually ceased, and the sheets of ejected material, probably also\r\nthe volcanic cones, were buried under at least several hundred feet of\r\nred sandstone. Whether or not any portion of the erupted material was\r\nfor a time built up above the level of the water, there seems to be no\r\nquestion that the vents were, on the whole, subaqueous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 206.--Section of sills traversing the Permian\r\nvolcanic series. River Ayr, Ballochmyle.\r\n\r\n_a_, Coal-measures; _b_ _b_, Basic lavas; _c_ _c_, Brick-red sandstones\r\nwith tuff; _d_, Red tuff and volcanic breccia; _e_ _e_, Dolerite sills.]\r\n\r\n3. _Sills._--The phenomena of sills and dykes are less clearly\r\ndeveloped among the Permian volcanic rocks of the Ayrshire basin than\r\namong those of older formations. In the section exposed in the course\r\nof the River Ayr at Howford Bridge, a coarsely crystalline dolerite\r\nwhich extends for nearly 300 yards up the stream, cuts the Permian\r\nlavas, of which it encloses patches as well as pieces of sandstone.\r\nAt the contact, the rock becomes fine-grained (Fig. 206). Through the\r\ncoarsely crystalline material run long parallel \"segregation veins\" of\r\na paler, more acid substance, as among the Carboniferous sills. Similar\r\nrocks are well seen in the Dippol Burn near Auchinleck House.\r\n\r\nPassing outward into the Coal-measures, we encounter a much larger\r\ndisplay of similar intrusive sheets. The best district for the study\r\nof these sills lies around Dalmellington. The Coal-measures are there\r\ntraversed by many intrusions, which have produced great destruction\r\namong the coal-seams. Some of the rocks are extremely basic, including\r\na beautiful picrite like that of Inchcolm (Letham Hill, near\r\nWaterside). The age of these sills must be later than the Coal-measures\r\ninto which they have been injected. Some of them are obviously\r\nconnected with the agglomerate-necks, and the whole or the greater\r\nnumber should thus probably be assigned to the Permian period.[94]\r\nThe phenomena of intrusion presented by these rocks reproduce the\r\nappearances already described in connection with the basic intrusive\r\nsheets of Carboniferous age.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: Explanation of Sheet 14, Geol. Surv. Scotland, p. 22.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Basin of the Firth of Forth\r\n\r\nThe other district of Southern Scotland, where traces of volcanic\r\naction later in age than the Coal-measures may be observed, lies in the\r\nbasin of the Firth of Forth (Map V.). They include no bedded lavas,\r\nand only at one locality do any relics of a covering of stratified\r\ntuffs overspread the Carboniferous formations. The evidence for the old\r\nvolcanoes consists almost entirely of necks of tuff, which mark the\r\nposition of vents of eruption.\r\n\r\n(1) _Vents._--On the south side of the estuary of the Forth there is\r\nonly one neck which may be plausibly placed in this series. It forms\r\nthe upper part of Arthur Seat, at Edinburgh. This hill has already\r\nbeen cited as consisting of two distinct portions. The lower, built up\r\nof bedded tuffs, basalts and andesites, forms part of the Midlothian\r\nvolcanic plateau of Carboniferous time. The vent from which these\r\nmaterials were ejected must lie at some little distance, and its site\r\nhas not been certainly ascertained. The upper part of the hill is\r\nformed of a distinct group of rocks which has now to be described.\r\n\r\nThe geological structure of Arthur Seat has long been well known.\r\nIt served as a theme for discussion in the Neptunist and Plutonist\r\ncontroversy, and was often referred to in the various mineralogical or\r\ngeognostical writings of the time. The first thorough examination of\r\nit as a relic of ancient volcanic action was that of Charles Maclaren,\r\npublished in 1839.[95] This author clearly recognized the later age and\r\nunconformable position of the coarse mass of agglomerate pierced by\r\nthe basalt of the apex, and pointed out the evidence of the upheaval\r\nand denudation of the older volcanic series during a long interval of\r\nrepose before the latest eruptions took place. Subsequently Edward\r\nForbes suggested that the upper part of the hill might be of Tertiary\r\nage.[96] Thereafter I mapped the ground in detail for the Geological\r\nSurvey, entirely confirming the observations of Maclaren.[97] In the end\r\nit seemed to me that the interval between the two epochs of volcanic\r\nactivity might not be so great as Forbes had supposed; and after\r\ntracing the Permian vents of Ayrshire, I came to the conclusion that\r\nthe younger unconformable agglomerate of Arthur Seat was not improbably\r\nPermian.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: _Geology of Fife and the Lothians_, p. 34. In a reprint of\r\nthis work, published in 1866, the venerable author briefly remarked in\r\na footnote that he no longer believed in the second period of volcanic\r\nactivity. This view was adopted in 1875 by Professor Judd, _Quart.\r\nJourn. Geol. Soc._ xxxi. p. 131. For the reasons stated in the text I\r\nbelieve Maclaren's original explanation of the structure of the hill to\r\nbe correct.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: Forbes never published his views regarding Arthur Seat,\r\nbut expounded them to his class, and explained them in diagrams, some\r\nof which are preserved in the Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art, in\r\nassociation with the specimens which he collected from the hill.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: Sheet 32, Geol. Survey of Scotland and descriptive Memoir.\r\nSee also _Rep. Brit. Assoc._ 1867, address Geol. Sect., and Murchison's\r\n_Siluria_, 4th edit. p. 331.]\r\n\r\nThe older volcanic series of this hill has been broken through by the\r\nagglomerate which occupies a true neck, and is abruptly marked off\r\nfrom all the rocks older than itself. There is no trace of any of the\r\nolder lavas or tuffs thickening towards this vent. On the contrary\r\nthey are completely truncated by it, and their outcrops on the north\r\nside reappear from under the agglomerate on the south side. Their\r\nescarpments are wrapped round by the agglomerate which likewise fills\r\nthe head of the hollow that had been previously worn by denudation out\r\nof the stratified deposits between the oldest lavas. There is thus a\r\nviolent unconformability between the later and the older volcanic rocks\r\nof Arthur Seat.\r\n\r\nThe length of time indicated by this stratigraphical break must be\r\ngreat. There is no known discordance in the Carboniferous system of\r\nthe Lothians, yet the Coal-measures, Millstone Grit, Carboniferous\r\nLimestone series and much of the Calciferous Sandstones were stripped\r\nfrom this hill before the eruption of the agglomerate. It will be shown\r\nin the sequel that a nearly similar amount of denudation preceded some\r\nof the probably Permian eruptions of Fife.\r\n\r\nThe agglomerate contains abundant fragments of the older volcanic\r\nseries. Its matrix is a dull red gravelly detritus, crowded with blocks\r\nof all sizes up to a yard or more in diameter. It is pierced by a\r\ncolumn or plug of basalt, which sends veins into it, and rises to the\r\napex of the hill. A beautiful olivine-basalt forms the lateral mass of\r\nthe Lion's Haunch, which rests on the agglomerate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 207.--Section showing the relations of the later\r\nrocks of Arthur Seat.\r\n\r\n  1. Grey and reddish sandstones and shales (Calciferous Sandstones);\r\n  2. The lava of the Long Row: the oldest of the Carboniferous\r\n  volcanic series; 3. Tuffs of the Dry Dam; 4. Columnar basalts\r\n  overlying the tuffs; 5. Andesite lavas of the eastern half of\r\n  Arthur Seat; 6. Sill of Heriot Mount; 7. Sill of Salisbury Crags;\r\n  8. Sill of the Dasses. These complete the Lower Carboniferous\r\n  volcanic series (compare Fig. 112). 9. White sandstones and black\r\n  shales, upper division of the Calciferous Sandstones; 10. Younger\r\n  volcanic agglomerate resting on the denuded ends of the older\r\n  volcanic series; 11. Basalt of the summit sending veins into the\r\n  agglomerate; 12. Basalt of the Lion's Haunch.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn general characters the agglomerate of Arthur Seat resembles that of\r\nsome of the younger vents of Fife which pierce the Coal-measures and\r\nare connected with tuffs that lie unconformably on the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone. On these various grounds I think that it may be reasonably\r\nassigned to the same geological period.\r\n\r\nThat a new vent should be opened, after the lapse of one or more\r\ngeological periods, on or near the site of more ancient volcanic\r\norifices is an incident of which, as we have seen, the geological\r\nhistory of the British Isles furnishes a number of examples. It will\r\nbe remembered that little more than a mile to the south of Arthur Seat\r\nlies the great vent of the Braid Hills, which in the time of the Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone gave forth such a huge pile of lavas and tuffs.\r\nVolcanic energy thereafter entirely died away, and in this district\r\nwas succeeded by a prolonged period of quiescence, during which the\r\nLower Old Red Sandstone was upraised and extensively denuded, while\r\nthe Upper Old Red Sandstone was deposited. At length, in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood, from one or more vents, the exact site of which is not\r\ncertainly known, the older lavas and tuffs of Arthur Seat, Calton\r\nHill and Craiglockhart Hill were erupted. Again, after another vast\r\ninterval, a new volcano appeared, and the agglomerate and younger\r\nbasalts of Arthur Seat were ejected from it. This is one of the most\r\nstriking examples in this country of the remarkable persistence of\r\nvolcanic energy in the same locality.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence at Arthur Seat itself to fix the geological date\r\nof the last volcanic activity of the hill. If the group of younger\r\nrocks stood alone, with no other trace of post-Carboniferous eruptions\r\nin the surrounding district, a plausible conjecture as to its age would\r\nnot be easily offered. But in reality it is not a solitary example\r\nof such rocks; for within sight, on the opposite side of the Firth\r\nof Forth, its counterparts may be seen. To the description of these\r\nnumerous and clearer illustrations I now proceed.\r\n\r\nThe East of Fife is remarkable for a large assemblage of volcanic\r\nvents, which, unlike those in Ayrshire and Nithsdale, stand alone,\r\ntheir superficial ejections having been removed by denudation, and no\r\nconnection being traceable between them and any Permian sandstones.\r\nThe vents filled up with agglomerate and pierced with plugs and veins\r\nof basalt, rise through the Carboniferous rocks, but have left no\r\nrecord for precisely defining their geological age. On the one hand,\r\nit is quite certain that in this district volcanic eruptions took\r\nplace during the earlier half of the Carboniferous period. To the\r\nnorth of Largo, and still more distinctly to the north-east of Leven,\r\nsections occur to show the contemporaneous outpouring of volcanic rocks\r\nduring the time of the Carboniferous Limestone. The Leven section,\r\nseen in a ravine a little to the north-east of the town, is specially\r\nimportant. It presents a succession of red and green fine sandy tuffs,\r\ninterstratified with fire-clays and sandstones, and containing a zone\r\nof basalt in the centre. These rocks lie not far from the top of the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone series.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is equally clear proof of far later eruptions.\r\nFrom St. Andrews to Elie a chain of necks may be traced, having the\r\nsame general characters, and piercing alike the Calciferous Sandstones,\r\nand the older part of the Carboniferous Limestone series. That these\r\nvents must in many cases be long posterior to the rocks among which\r\nthey rise, is indicated by some curious and interesting kinds of\r\nevidence. They are often replete with angular fragments of shale,\r\nsandstone and limestone, of precisely the same mineral characters as\r\nthe surrounding strata, and containing the same organic remains in an\r\nidentical state of fossilization. It is clear that these strata must\r\nhave had very much their present lithological aspect before the vents\r\nwere opened through them. Again, the necks may often be observed to\r\nrise among much contorted strata, as, for example, along the crest of a\r\nsharp anticlinal arch, or across a synclinal basin. The Carboniferous\r\nrocks must thus have been considerably plicated before the time of\r\nthe volcanic eruptions. In the next place, the vents often occur on\r\nlines of dislocation without being affected thereby. They must be\r\nposterior, however, not only to these dislocations, but also to much\r\nsubsequent denudation, inasmuch as their materials overspread the rocks\r\non each side of a fault without displacement. Hence we conclude with\r\nconfidence, that a great deal of volcanic activity in the East of Fife\r\nmust have been posterior to most, if not all, of the Carboniferous\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 208.--Section in brooks between Bonnytown and\r\nBaldastard, Largo.\r\n\r\n_a_, Sandstone shales and coals of Carboniferous Limestone series; _b_,\r\nunconformable tuff.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Largo, further important evidence is presented,\r\nconfirming and extending this conclusion. The highest member of the\r\nUpper Coal-measures, consisting of various red sandstones, with red\r\nand purple clays, shales, thin coals and ironstones, is prolonged\r\nfrom the Fife coal-field in a tongue which extends eastward beyond\r\nthe village of Lower Largo. It is well displayed on the shore, where\r\nevery bed may be followed in succession along the beach for a space\r\nof nearly two miles. Two volcanic necks, presenting the same features\r\nas those which pierce the older portions of the Carboniferous system\r\nto the east, rise through these red rocks. We are thus carried not\r\nonly beyond the time of the Carboniferous Limestone, but beyond the\r\nclose of the very latest stage of the Carboniferous period in Central\r\nScotland. Connected with these and other vents farther north, there\r\nis a large area of tuff which has been thrown out upon the faulted\r\nand greatly denuded Carboniferous rocks. It may be traced passing\r\nfrom the red Upper Coal-measures across the large fault which here\r\nseparates that formation from the Carboniferous Limestone, and\r\nextending inland athwart different horizons of the latter series.\r\nOutlying fragmentary cakes of it may be seen resting on the upturned\r\nedges of the sandstones, shales and coal-seams, even at a distance\r\nof some miles towards the north-west, proving that the fragmentary\r\nmaterials discharged from the vents spread over a considerable area.\r\nThe accompanying section (Fig. 208) may serve as an illustration of the\r\nrelation between this sheet of bedded tuff and the underlying rocks.\r\n\r\nThough interstratified volcanic rocks occur in the Carboniferous\r\nsystem of the East of Fife, no connection has been traced between them\r\nand any of the vents now referred to. While none of these vents can\r\nbe proved to be of Carboniferous age, it is of course possible that\r\nsuch may be the true date of some of them. Others, nevertheless, and\r\nprobably much the largest number, judged from the data just given, may\r\nbe regarded as probably post-Carboniferous. Those which happen to rise\r\nthrough the uppermost Coal-measures do not appear to be distinguishable\r\nby any essential characters from those which pierce indifferently\r\nthe Carboniferous Limestone series and Calciferous Sandstones of the\r\nEast of Fife. They seem to be all one connected aggregate, resembling\r\neach other alike in their external characters, internal structure and\r\ncomponent materials, and the limit of their age must be determined\r\nby the geological horizon of the youngest formation which they\r\ntraverse. By this process of reasoning I reach the conclusion that\r\nthis remarkable series of old volcanoes in the East of Scotland not\r\nimprobably dates from the same time as that of Ayrshire and Nithsdale,\r\nalready described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 209.--View of Largo Law from the east (the crag on\r\nthe left, at the base of the cone, is a portion of a basalt-stream. See\r\nFig. 226).]\r\n\r\nSome idea of the importance and interest of the volcanic area of\r\nEastern Fife may be gathered from the fact that in a space of about\r\n70 square miles no fewer than 60 necks may be counted, and others are\r\nprobably concealed below the drift-deposits which cover so much of the\r\ninterior of the country. The area of this remarkable display extends\r\nfrom St. Andrews Bay and the Vale of the Eden southwards to the coast\r\nof the Firth of Forth between Lundin Links and St. Monans. All over the\r\ninland tract the necks form more or less marked eminences, of which the\r\nlargest are conspicuous landmarks from the southern side of the Firth.\r\nBut the distinguishing characteristic of the area is the display of the\r\nnecks along the coast, where, in a series of natural dissections, their\r\nform, composition, internal structure and relations to the surrounding\r\nrocks have been laid open in such clearness and variety as have been\r\nmet with in the volcanic records of no other geological period within\r\nthe compass of these islands. As this district thus possesses a\r\nsingular interest and value for the study of volcanic vents, I shall\r\nenter in some detail into the description of the sections so admirably\r\nlaid bare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 210.--View of small neck in Calciferous Sandstones,\r\non the shore, three miles east from St. Andrews.\r\n\r\n(This illustration, likewise Figs. 212, 216, 219, 221, 222, 225 and 227\r\nare from photographs taken for the Geological Survey by Mr. R. Lunn.)]\r\n\r\nAs in Ayrshire, the necks in the East of Fife generally rise as\r\nisolated conical or dome-shaped hills, with smooth grassy slopes, but\r\nwhere a dyke or boss of basalt occurs in them, it usually stands out\r\nas a crag or knoll. Largo Law (Fig. 209) may be taken as a singularly\r\nperfect example of the cone-shaped neck. This hill, however, comprises\r\nmore than one vent. The mass of tuff of which it consists probably\r\nincludes at least three distinct funnels of discharge, and surrounding\r\nit there still remains a good deal of the fragmental material that\r\ngathered around these vents and is now seen to lie unconformably upon\r\nthe Carboniferous formations (Fig. 208). There must be a total area\r\nof not much less than four square miles over which tuff occupies the\r\nsurface of the ground.\r\n\r\nWhile the Fife necks possess the great advantage of having been laid\r\nbare by the sea, their frequent small size on the coast allows their\r\nwhole area to be examined. As illustrations of these little vents, two\r\nplates are here given from the coast-line to the east of St. Andrews,\r\nwhere a number of small necks of agglomerate have been planted among\r\nthe plicated Calciferous Sandstones. In Fig. 210 the abrupt truncation\r\nof the sandstones by the volcanic rock is well shown. The strata on the\r\nright have been broken through, and the sea has indented a small gully\r\nalong the wall of the old volcanic funnel. The sandstones in front,\r\nhowever, still adhere firmly to the agglomerate, which rises above them\r\nas a rugged mass of rock.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 212 the edge of the vent can be traced partly in section and\r\npartly in plan for about half of its circumference. On the right\r\nhand, the actual wall of the funnel is visible where the false-bedded\r\nsandstones are sharply cut off by the agglomerate. In front the strata\r\nappear in plan on the beach, and their ledges can be seen to the left\r\nstriking at the margin of the neck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 211.--Ground-plan of Permian volcanic vents.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 212.--Small neck in Calciferous Sandstones a little\r\neast from the \"Rock and Spindle,\" two and a half miles east from St.\r\nAndrews.]\r\n\r\nThe shape of the Fife vents is, as usual, generally circular or\r\noval; but is subject to considerable irregularity. The coast-section\r\nbetween Largo and St. Monans exposes many ground-plans of them, and\r\npermits their irregularities to be closely examined. The accompanying\r\nfigure (Fig. 211) exhibits some characteristic forms. Eccentricities\r\nof outline no doubt arose from the irregular way in which the rocks\r\nyielded to the forces of explosion during the piercing of a volcanic\r\norifice. This is often well shown by the veins and nests of tuff or\r\nagglomerate which have been forced into the rents or sinuosities of\r\nthe orifices. In other cases, however, it is probable that, as among\r\nthe Ayrshire necks, and those of Carboniferous age already cited, what\r\nappears now as one volcanic neck was the result of a shifting of the\r\nactual funnel of discharge, so that the neck really represents several\r\nclosely adjacent vents. The case of Largo Law has been already noticed.\r\nThe necks at Kellie Law (Fig. 213) show clearly the same structure, the\r\nLaw itself (1) probably consisting of two contiguous vents, while a\r\nthird (2) forms a smaller cone immediately to the east. Such a slight\r\nlateral displacement of the vent has been noticed at many Tertiary and\r\nrecent volcanic orifices. In the island or peninsula of Volcanello,\r\nfor example, three craters indicate successive shiftings of the vent,\r\nthe most perfect of them marking the latest and diminishing phase of\r\nvolcanic activity (Fig. 214, compare Fig. 29, vol. i., p. 70).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 213.--Plan of volcanic necks at Kellie Law, east of\r\nFife, on the scale of three inches to one mile.\r\n\r\n1, Kellie Law (tuff); 2, Carnbee Law (tuff); 3, 4, 5, small tuff necks;\r\nB B, basalt dykes and bosses; _c_ _c_, coal-seams; _l_, limestone; _f_,\r\nfault. The arrows mark the dip of the strata through which the necks\r\nhave been drilled.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 214.--Plan of the craters in Volcanello, Lipari\r\nIslands.]\r\n\r\nThe Fife necks vary from only a few yards up to perhaps 4000 feet in\r\ndiameter. One of the smallest and most completely exposed occurs on the\r\nshore at Newark Castle, near St. Monans. It measures only 60 yards in\r\nlength by about 37 yards in breadth. A ground-plan of it is given in\r\nFig 224. Still smaller is the neck at Buddo Ness, on the coast east of\r\nSt. Andrews, which measures only 20 yards across.\r\n\r\nFrom the way in which the vents have been dissected by the sea along\r\nthe Fife coast, the geologist is enabled to study in minute detail\r\nthe effects of the volcanic operations upon the strata through which\r\nthe funnels have been drilled. Considerable variation may be observed\r\nin the nature and amount of change. Sometimes the orifice has been\r\nmade without any noticeable alteration of the sandstones, shales and\r\nlimestones, which retain their dip and strike up to the very wall of\r\nthe chimney. Usually there is more or less jumbling and crushing of\r\nthe stratification, and often a considerable amount of induration. As\r\na typical example of these effects I give a section from the margin of\r\nthe neck of tuff on the east side of Elie Harbour (Fig. 215). Here the\r\nsandstones and shales (_a_) have been doubled over and dragged down\r\nagainst the tuff (_b_). They have likewise been hardened into a kind of\r\nquartzite, and this alteration extends for about 20 to 30 feet from the\r\nedge of the neck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 215.--Section of the strata at the edge of the\r\nvolcanic vent on the east side of Elie Harbour.]\r\n\r\nThe material which has filled up the vents is almost entirely\r\nfragmental, varying from a coarse agglomerate to a fine volcanic tuff.\r\nSome minor necks have been completely or in great part filled with\r\nangular debris of the ordinary rocks of the neighbourhood. In the\r\nwestern neck on the Largo shore, for example, which rises through the\r\nred rocks of the Upper Coal-measures, the material consists largely\r\nof fragments of red sandstone, clay and shale. Between Elie and St.\r\nMonans, some of the necks are filled almost wholly with debris of black\r\nshale and encrinal limestone.\r\n\r\nThere does not appear to be any relation between the diameter of a\r\nfunnel and the size of the blocks that now fill it. Some of the larger\r\nnecks, for example, consist of comparatively fine tuff. The Buddo Ness,\r\non the other hand, though so small a vent, is packed with blocks of\r\nshale six feet long, while the sandstone through which the orifice has\r\nbeen drilled passes, as usual, into quartzite for several yards away\r\nfrom the edge. As an example of the general aspect presented by one\r\nof the coarse agglomerates in the necks of the Fife coast, a view is\r\ngiven in Fig. 216 of a portion of the neck at Ardross, about two miles\r\neast from Elie. This thoroughly volcanic accumulation is here shown to\r\nconsist of blocks of all sizes heaped together without any definite\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 216.--Agglomerate of neck on shore at Ardross, two\r\nmiles east from Elie.]\r\n\r\nSince the first stage in the history of the vents has been the\r\nperforation of the solid crust by explosion, and the consequent\r\nproduction of debris from the disrupted rocks, we may hope to detect\r\nunderneath the pile of thoroughly volcanic ejections, traces of the\r\nfirst explosions. I have been much struck with the fact that in the\r\nEast of Fife such traces may frequently be found here and there within\r\nthe outer border of the vents. At Largo, and again between Elie and\r\nSt. Monans, it may be noticed that the mass of material adhering to\r\nthe wall of a neck, exposed in ground-plan upon the beach, often\r\nconsists largely, or even wholly, of debris of sandstone, shale and\r\nlimestone, while the central and chief mass is made up of green tuff or\r\nagglomerate, with occasional pieces of the surrounding stratified rocks\r\nscattered through it. It seems probable, therefore, that the sections\r\nof these Fife necks, laid bare on the present shore, do not lie far\r\nbelow the original crater-bottoms.\r\n\r\nSome light might be expected to be thrown upon the phenomena in\r\nan active volcanic chimney by the condition of the fragments of\r\nrecognizable sedimentary rocks imbedded in the ejected debris which has\r\nfilled up the orifice. But the assistance from this source is neither\r\nso full nor so reliable as could be wished. In some of the Fife vents,\r\nindeed, the fragments of shale, sandstone and other sedimentary strata\r\nare so unchanged that they cannot on a fresh fracture be distinguished\r\nfrom the adjacent parent strata. The _Spirifers_, _Lingulæ_, crinoids,\r\ncyprid-cases, ganoid scales and other fossils are often as fresh and\r\nperfect in the fragments of rock imbedded in tuff as they are in the\r\nrock _in situ_. In some cases, however, distinct, and occasionally even\r\nextreme, metamorphism may be detected, varying in intensity from mere\r\ninduration to the production of a crystalline texture. The amount of\r\nalteration has depended not merely upon the heat of the volcanic vent,\r\nbut also in great measure upon the susceptibility of the fragments to\r\nundergo change and the duration of their exposure to it.\r\n\r\nDr. Heddle has computed the temperature to which fragments of shale,\r\netc., in tuff-necks of the Fife coast have been subjected. He found\r\nthat the bituminous shales have lost all their illuminants, and of\r\norganic matter have retained only some black carbonaceous particles;\r\nthat the encrinal limestones have become granular and crystalline;\r\nthat the sandstones present themselves as quartzite, and that black\r\ncarbonaceous clays show every stage of a passage into Lydian-stone. He\r\ninferred from the slight depth to which the alteration has penetrated\r\nthe larger calcareous fragments, that the heat to which they were\r\nexposed must have been but of short continuance. As the result of his\r\nexperiments, he concluded that the temperature at which the fragments\r\nwere finally ejected from the volcanic vents probably lay between 660°\r\nand 900° Fahr.[98]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxviii. p. 487.]\r\n\r\nIt may be perhaps legitimate to infer that, while the fragments that\r\nfell back into the volcanic funnel, or which were detached from\r\nthe sides of the vent, after having been exposed for some time to\r\nintense heat under considerable pressure, would suffer more or less\r\nmetamorphism, those, on the other hand, which were discharged by the\r\næriform explosions from the cool upper crust, on the first outburst of\r\na vent, would not exhibit any trace of such a change. Where, therefore,\r\nwe meet with a neck full of fragments of unaltered stratified rocks, we\r\nmay suppose it to have been that of a short-lived volcano; where, on\r\nthe other hand, the fragments are few and much altered, they may mark\r\nthe site of a vent which continued longer active. The metamorphism\r\nof the fragmentary contents of a volcanic funnel by the action of\r\nascending vapours has already been described in the case of one of the\r\nvents of the Carboniferous plateaux (vol. i. p. 404).\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious and puzzling features in the contents of the\r\ntuff necks of the Fife coast is the occurrence there of crystals and\r\nfragments of minerals, often of considerable size, which do not bear\r\nevidence of having-been formed _in situ_, but have undoubtedly been\r\nejected with the other detritus. Dr. Heddle has noticed the fact,\r\nand has described some of the minerals which occur in this way. The\r\nfollowing list comprises the species which he and I have found:--\r\n\r\n  Hornblende, in rounded fragments of a glassy black cleavable variety.\r\n  Augite, sometimes in small crystals, elsewhere in rounded fragments of\r\n    an augitic glass.\r\n  Orthoclase (Sanidine), abundant in worn twin crystals in the tuffs of\r\n    the east of Fife.\r\n  Plagioclase.\r\n  Biotite.\r\n  Pyrope, in the tuffs (and more rarely in the basalts) of Elie.\r\n  Nigrine, common in some of the dykes, more rarely in the tuffs of Elie.\r\n  Saponite, Delessite and other decomposition products.\r\n  Semi-opal, one specimen found in the later (Permian?) agglomerate of\r\n    Arthur's Seat.\r\n  Asphalt, abundant at Kincraig, near Elie.\r\n  Fragments of wood, with structure well preserved, may be included here.\r\n\r\nDr. Heddle has described from the neck of tuff at Kinkell, near\r\nSt. Andrews, large twin crystals of a glassy orthoclase, which are\r\ninvariably much worn, and preserve only rudely the form of crystals.\r\nHe justly remarks that they have no connection with drusy cavity,\r\nexfiltration vein, or with any other mineral, and look as if a portion\r\nof their substance has been dissolved away. Internally, however,\r\nthey are quite fresh and brilliant in lustre, though sometimes much\r\nfissured.[99]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxviii. p. 223.]\r\n\r\nThe tuffs at Elie are full of similar crystals. I obtained from one\r\nof the necks east of that village a specimen which measures 4 inches\r\nin length, 3-1/2 in breadth, and 2-1/4 in thickness, and weighs about\r\n2 lbs. It is, however, a well-striated felspar. From the same tuff\r\nI procured an orthoclase twin in the Carlsbad form. All the felspar\r\npieces, though fresh and brilliant internally, have the same rounded\r\nand abraded external appearance.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of hornblende form a characteristic feature in several of\r\nthe Elie dykes (to be afterwards described), and in the neighbourhood\r\nof these intrusive rocks occur more sparingly in the tuff. It is a\r\nglossy-black cleavable mineral, in rounded pieces of all sizes, up to\r\nthat of a small egg. Dr. Heddle obtained a cleavage angle of 124° 19',\r\nand found on analysis that the mineral was hornblende.[100]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: _Op. cit._ xxviii. p. 522.]\r\n\r\nAugite occurs sparingly in two forms among the rocks. I have obtained\r\nsmall crystals from the red agglomerate on the south side of Arthur\r\nSeat, recalling in their general appearance those of Somma. Lumps of\r\nan augitic glass have been found by Dr. Heddle, sometimes as large as\r\na pigeon's egg, in two of the dykes at Elie, and in the tuff at the\r\nKinkell neck, near St. Andrews. He observed the same substance at\r\nthe Giant's Causeway, both in the basalt and scattered through one of\r\nthe interstratified beds of red bole. Much larger rounded masses of\r\na similar augitic glass, but with a distinct trace of cleavage, have\r\nalready been referred to as occurring in a volcanic vent of Upper Old\r\nRed Sandstone age at John o' Groat's House.[101]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: _Op. cit._ xxviii. pp. 481 _et seq._, and _ante_, vol. i.\r\np. 352.]\r\n\r\nBiotite is not a rare mineral in some tuffs. It may be obtained in\r\nLower Carboniferous tuffs of Dunbar, in plates nearly an inch broad;\r\nbut the largest specimen I have obtained is one from the same Elie\r\nvent which yielded the large felspar fragment. It measures 2-1/2 × 2\r\n× 1/2 inches. These mica tables, like the other minerals, are abraded\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nThat these various minerals were ejected as fragments, and have not\r\nbeen formed _in situ_, is the conclusion forced upon the observer\r\nwho examines carefully their mode of occurrence. Some of them were\r\ncarried up to the surface by liquid volcanic mud, and appear in dykes\r\nof that material like plums in a cake. But even there they present the\r\nsame evidence of attrition. They assuredly have not been formed in\r\nthe dykes any more than in the surrounding tuff. In both cases they\r\nare extraneous objects which have been accidentally involved in the\r\nvolcanic rocks. Dr. Heddle remarks that the occurrence of the worn\r\npieces of orthoclase in the tuff is an enigma to him. I have been as\r\nunable to frame any satisfactory explanation of it.[102]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: Occasionally the crystals can be matched in some lava-form\r\nrock of the same volcanic area; but many of them have no such\r\ncounterparts. See vol. i. p. 62 and _note_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 217.--Ground-plan of volcanic neck, Elie Harbour, showing\r\n  circular deposition of the stratification.\r\n\r\n  T, Tuff of the neck, the arrows showing its inward dip; B B, Dykes;\r\n  S, Sandstones and shales, through which the neck has been opened.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt might have been thought that within the throat of a volcano, if in\r\nany circumstances, loose materials should have taken an indefinite\r\namorphous aggregation. And, as has been shown in the foregoing\r\nchapters, this is usually the case where the materials are coarse and\r\nthe vent small. Oblong blocks are found stuck on end, while small and\r\nlarge are all mixed confusedly together. But in numerous cases where\r\nthe tuff is more gravelly in texture, and sometimes even where it is\r\ncoarse, traces of stratification may be observed. Layers of coarse\r\nand fine material succeed each other, as they are seen to do among\r\nthe ordinary interstratified tuffs. The stratification is usually\r\nat high angles of inclination, often vertical. So distinctly do the\r\nlines of deposit appear amid the confused and jumbled masses, that\r\nan observer may be tempted to explain the problem by supposing the\r\ntuff to belong not to a neck, but to an interbedded deposit which\r\nhas somehow been broken up by dislocations. That the stratification,\r\nhowever, belongs to the original volcanic vents themselves is made\r\nexceedingly clear by some of the coast-sections in the East of Fife.\r\nOn both sides of Elie, examples occur in which a distinct circular\r\ndisposition of the bedding can be traced corresponding to the general\r\nform of the neck. The accompanying ground-plan (Fig. 217) represents\r\nthis structure as seen in the neck which forms the headland at Elie\r\nharbour. Alternations of coarse and fine tuff with bands of coarse\r\nagglomerate, dipping at angles of 60° and upwards, may be traced round\r\nabout half of the circle. The incomplete part may have been destroyed\r\nby the formation of another contiguous neck immediately to the east. To\r\nthe west of Earlsferry another large, but also imperfect, circle may\r\nbe traced in one of the shore necks. A quarter of a mile farther west\r\nrises the great cliff-line of Kincraig, where a large neck has been\r\ncut open into a range of precipices 200 feet high, as well as into a\r\ntide-washed platform more than half a mile long. The inward dip and\r\nhigh angles of the tuff are admirably laid bare along that portion of\r\nthe coast-line. The section in which almost every bed can be seen, and\r\nwhere, therefore, there is no need for hypothetical restoration, is as\r\nshown in Fig. 218.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the frequently abundant pieces of stratified\r\ntuff, found as ejected blocks in vents filled with tuff, and to the\r\nderivation of these blocks from tuff originally deposited within the\r\ncrater. There can, I think, be little hesitation in regarding the\r\nstratification of these Fife vents as a record of successive deposits\r\nof volcanic detritus inside the vents. The general dip inwards from the\r\nouter rim of the vent strikingly recalls that of some modern volcanoes.\r\nBy way of illustration, I give here a section of part of the outer rim\r\nof the crater of the Island of Volcano, sketched by myself in the year\r\n1870 while ascending the mountain from the north side (Fig. 220). The\r\ncrater wall at this point consists of two distinct parts--an older tuff\r\n(_a_), which may have been in great measure cleared out of the crater\r\nbefore the ejection of the newer tuff (_b_). The latter lies on the\r\nouter slope of the cone at the usual angle of 30°. It folds over the\r\ncrest of the rim, and dips down to the flat tuff-covered crater bottom,\r\nat an angle of 37°. These are its natural angles of repose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 218.--Section across the great vent of Kincraig,\r\nElie, on a true scale, vertical and horizontal, of six inches to a mile.\r\n\r\n1, Sandstones, shale, etc., of Lower Carboniferous age, plunging down\r\ntoward the neck T; B, columnar basalt, shown also in Figs. 223 and\r\n225.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 219.--Dyke in volcanic neck, on the beach, St.\r\nMonans.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 220.--Section of part of crater rim, Island of\r\nVolcano.]\r\n\r\nApplying modern analogies of this kind, I have been led to conclude\r\nthat the stratification so conspicuous in the tuff of the vents in the\r\neast of Fife and in the Carboniferous series of the Lothians belongs\r\nto the interior of the crater and the upper part of the volcanic\r\nfunnel.[103] These stratified tuffs, on this view of their origin, must\r\nbe regarded as remains of the beds of dust and stones which gathered\r\nwithin the crater and volcanic orifice, and which, on the cessation of\r\nvolcanic action, sometimes remained in their original position, or were\r\ndislocated and slipped down into the cavity beneath. That the tuffs\r\nconsolidated on slopes, perhaps quite as steep as those of Volcano,\r\nis now and then indicated by an interesting structure. The larger\r\nstones imbedded in the layers of tuff may be observed to have on their\r\nfronts in one direction a small heap of coarse gravelly debris, while\r\nfine tuff is heaped up against their opposite side. This arrangement\r\ndoubtless points to deposit on a slope of loose debris, from which the\r\nlarger blocks protruded so as to arrest the smaller stones, and allow\r\nthe fine dust to gather behind.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: Further illustrations of this characteristic structure of\r\nsome vents will be found in the account of the Tertiary vents of the\r\nFaroe Isles in Chapter xli. See also the remarks in the introductory\r\nchapters, vol. i. p. 63.]\r\n\r\nIf the inference be correct, that the stratification here described\r\nbelongs to the old craters or the upper parts of the funnels, it\r\nfurnishes additional evidence of the wide interval of time that elapsed\r\nbetween the deposition of the Carboniferous strata and the outbreak\r\nof these vents. During that interval prolonged denudation reduced\r\nthe upturned Carboniferous Limestone series to nearly its present\r\nform of surface, and any materials discharged from the vents over the\r\nsurrounding ground would obviously lie with a violent unconformability\r\non the rocks below.\r\n\r\nThe frequent great disturbance in the bedding of the tuff within the\r\nvents may be connected with some kind of collapse, subsidence or\r\nshrinkage of the materials in the funnel below. That a movement of this\r\nnature did take place is shown by the remarkable bending down of the\r\nstrata round the margins of the vents, which has been already described.\r\n\r\nThe minor vents for the most part contain only fragmentary materials;\r\nbut those of larger size usually present masses of lava in some\r\ncharacteristic forms. In not a few cases, the lava has risen in the\r\ncentral pipe and has hardened there into a column of solid rock.\r\nSubsequent denudation, by removing most of the cone, has left the top\r\nof this thick column projecting as a round knoll upon the hill-top.\r\nArthur Seat presents a good example of this structure. Where the\r\ndenudation has not proceeded so far, we may still meet with a remnant\r\nof the cake of lava which sometimes overflowed the bottom of a crater.\r\nThe summit of Largo Law affords indications of this arrangement, the\r\ncone of tuff being there capped with basalt, evidently the product of\r\nsuccessive streams, which welling out irregularly covered the crater\r\nbottom with hummocks and hollows (Fig. 226). The knolls are beautifully\r\ncolumnar, and sometimes show a divergent arrangement of the prisms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 221.--Dyke rising through the agglomerate of a\r\nvolcanic vent; Kincraig, Elie.]\r\n\r\nBut the most frequent form assumed by the lava in the necks is that\r\nof veins or dykes running as wall-like bands through the tuff or\r\nagglomerate. Many admirable examples may be cited from the shore\r\nbetween Largo and St. Monans. Two illustrations of them are given in\r\nFigs. 219 and 221. In Fig. 219 the dyke is about four feet broad, and\r\nis seen to present the common transverse jointing as it pursues its\r\nway through the tuff. White veins of calcite along its margin serve to\r\ndefine its limits. Its position in reference to the general body of the\r\nneck is shown in the ground-plan Fig. 224. The second instance (Fig.\r\n221) is that of a dyke of basalt only one foot wide, which runs like a\r\nwall up the agglomerate of the Kincraig neck near Elie. It is seen at\r\nthe bottom of the cliff projecting from the agglomerate; but higher up\r\nit has decayed, leaving its fissure as a gaping chasm. Here the general\r\ncharacter of the pyroclastic material is well brought out. One or two\r\nlarge blocks may be seen imbedded in it, the largest lying above where\r\nthe dyke bends away to the left.\r\n\r\nThe intruded masses vary in breadth from mere threadlike veins up to\r\ndykes several yards in breadth, which sometimes expand into large\r\nirregular lumps. They generally consist of some form of basalt; now\r\nand then, as at Ruddon Point, near Elie, they are amygdaloidal; and it\r\nmay be observed among them, as among dykes in general, that where the\r\namygdaloidal texture is developed, it is apt to occur most markedly in\r\nthe central part of the vein, the amygdales running there in one or\r\nmore lines parallel with the general trend of the mass.\r\n\r\nThat the basalt of these veins and dykes was sometimes injected in an\r\nextremely liquid condition is shown by its frequently exceedingly close\r\nhomogeneous texture. Within the neck on the shore to the west of Largo,\r\nthe basalt assumes in places an almost flinty character, which here and\r\nthere passes into a thin external varnish of basalt-glass. A farther\r\nindication of the liquidity of the original rock seems to be furnished\r\nby the great number of included extraneous fragments here and there to\r\nbe observed in the basalt.\r\n\r\nBut besides basalt, other materials may more rarely be detected\r\nassuming the form of dykes or veins within the necks. Thus, at\r\nthe Largo neck just referred to, strings of an exceedingly horny\r\nquartz-felsite accompany the basalt--a remarkable conjunction of\r\nacid and basic rock within the same volcanic chimney. To the east\r\nof Elie some dykes, which stand out prominently on the beach from a\r\nplatform worn by the sea in a neck, consist of an extremely compact\r\nvolcanic mudstone, stuck full of the worn twin crystals of orthoclase\r\nand pieces of hornblende and biotite already noticed. So like is\r\nthis rock to one of the decomposing basalts that its true fragmental\r\nnature may easily escape notice, and it might be classed confidently\r\nas a somewhat decayed basalt. A considerable amount of a similar fine\r\ncompact mudstone is to be seen round the edges of some of the Elie\r\nvents. This material must have been injected into open fissures, where\r\nit solidified. There is further evidence of the presence of \"mud-lava\"\r\nin some of the vents of East Fife, where these orifices contain a\r\nremarkable compact volcanic sandstone, composed of the usual detritus,\r\nbut weathering into spheroidal crusts, so as externally to be readily\r\nmistaken for some form of basalt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 222.--Radiating columnar dyke in the tuff of a\r\nvolcanic vent, Rock and Spindle, two and a half miles east from St.\r\nAndrews.]\r\n\r\nA columnar arrangement may often be observed among the basalt dykes.\r\nWhen the vein or dyke is vertical, the columns of course seem piled\r\nin horizontal layers one above the other. The exposed side of the\r\ndyke then reveals a wall of rock, seemingly built up of hexagonal\r\nor polygonal, neatly fitting blocks of masonry, as in the Lower\r\nCarboniferous vent of the Binn of Burntisland (Figs. 166, 168). An\r\ninclination of the dyke from the vertical throws up the columns to\r\na proportional departure from the horizontal. Sometimes a beautiful\r\nfan-shaped grouping of the prisms has taken place. Of this structure\r\nthe Rock and Spindle, near St. Andrews, presents a familiar example\r\n(Fig. 222). Much more striking, however, though less known, is the\r\nmagnificent basalt mass of Kincraig, to the west of Elie, where the\r\ncolumns sweep from summit to base of the cliff, a height of fully 150\r\nfeet, like the Orgues d'Expailly, near Le Puy in Auvergne. The general\r\nposition of this basalt in the vent is represented in the section (B,\r\nFig. 218). The curvature of the basalt is shown in Fig. 223, which is\r\ntaken from the Elie side looking westward, beyond the intrusions, to\r\nthe picturesque cliffs of tuff. The details of the cliff are given in\r\nFig. 225.\r\n\r\nThat many of the dykes served as lines of escape for the basalt to the\r\nouter slopes of the cones is highly probable, though denudation has\r\nusually destroyed the proofs of such an outflow. A distinct radiation\r\nof the dykes from the centre of a neck is still sometimes traceable.\r\nThis structure is most marked on the south cone of Largo Law, where\r\na number of hard ribs of basalt project from the slopes of the hill.\r\nTheir general trend is such that if prolonged they would meet somewhere\r\nin the centre of the cone. On the south-east side of the hill a minor\r\neminence, termed the Craig Rock, stands out prominently (Fig. 209).\r\nIt is oblong in shape, and, like the dykes, points towards the centre\r\nof the cone. It consists of a compact columnar basalt, the columns\r\nconverging from the sides towards the top of the ridge. It looks like\r\nthe fragment of a lava-current which flowed down a gully on the outer\r\nslope of the cone (B' in Fig. 226).\r\n\r\nVeins of basalt are not confined to the necks, but may be seen running\r\nacross the surrounding rocks. The shore at St. Monans furnishes some\r\ninstructive examples of this character. As the veins thin away from\r\nthe main mass of basalt they become more close-grained and lighter in\r\ncolour, and when they enter dark shales or other carbonaceous rocks\r\nthey pass, as usual, into the white earthy clay-like \"white-trap.\" The\r\ninfluence of carbonaceous strata in thus altering basic dykes and sills\r\nmay be instructively studied along the shore of the East of Fife. A\r\ngood instance occurs near St. Monans Church (Fig. 227), where a vein of\r\n\"white-trap\" traverses black shales which have been somewhat jumbled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 223.--View of part of the shore front of the great\r\nvent at Kincraig, looking westward, with the columnar basalt in front.]\r\n\r\nIn a modern volcano no opportunity is afforded of examining the contact\r\nof the erupted material with the rocks through which the vent has\r\nbeen opened. But in the basin of the Firth of Forth, within the area\r\nnow under description, a numerous series of coast-sections lays bare\r\nthis relation in the most satisfactory manner. The superincumbent\r\ncones of tuff have been swept away, and we can examine, as it were,\r\nthe very roots of the old volcanoes. The margin of a neck or volcanic\r\nvent is thus found to be almost always sharply defined. The rocks\r\nthrough which the funnel has been drilled have been cut across, as if\r\na huge auger had been sunk through them. This is well displayed in\r\nthe beautifully perfect neck already cited at Newark Castle, near St.\r\nMonans (Fig. 224). The strata through which this neck rises consist\r\nof shales, sandstones, thin coal and encrinal limestones, dipping\r\nin a westerly direction at angles ranging from 25° to 60°. At the\r\nsouth end of the neck they are sharply truncated, as if by a fault.\r\nElsewhere they are much jumbled, slender vein-like portions of the tuff\r\nbeing insinuated among the projecting strata. A large vertical bed\r\nof sandstone, 24 yards long by 7 yards broad, stands up as a sinuous\r\nreef on the east side of the vent (_s_). It is a portion of some of\r\nthe surrounding strata, but, so far as can be seen at the surface, is\r\nentirely surrounded with agglomerate. Here and there the shales have\r\nbeen excessively crumpled, and at the north end have been invaded by\r\na vein of basalt which, where it runs through them, assumes the usual\r\nclay-like character. The strata have been blown out, and their place\r\nhas been occupied by a corresponding mass of volcanic agglomerate. But\r\ntheir remaining truncated edges round the margin of the orifice have\r\nundergone comparatively little alteration. In some places they have\r\nbeen hardened, but their usual texture and structure remain unaffected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 224.--Plan of volcanic neck on beach near St.\r\nMonans.\r\n\r\n  T, Neck of tuff enclosing a mass of sandstone (_s_), and piercing\r\n  sandstones and shales With beds of limestone, (_l_ _l_), and a thin\r\n  seam of coal (_c_); B, Basalt \"white-trap\" dyke. The arrows show\r\n  the dip of the strata.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn a few examples, the progress of denudation has not advanced so far\r\nthat the cone cannot still be partially made out amidst its surrounding\r\nmasses of tuff. One of the most interesting of these is Largo Law, of\r\nwhich an outline has been given in Fig. 209. The accompanying section\r\n(Fig. 226) represents what appears to me to be the structure of this\r\nhill. Each of the two now conjoined cones was probably in succession\r\nthe vent of the volcano. The southern and rather lower eminence, as\r\nalready mentioned, is traversed by rib-like dykes of basalt, which\r\npoint towards its top, where there is a bed of the same rock underlying\r\na capping of tuff. On its eastern declivity lies the basalt stream\r\nalready described (p. 87). The higher cone is surmounted by a cake of\r\nbasalt which, as I have above suggested, may have solidified at the\r\nbottom of the latest crater. Of course all trace of the crater has\r\ndisappeared, but the general conical form of the volcanic mass remains.\r\nDoubtless, still more of the old volcano would have been removed by\r\ndenudation but for the protection afforded to the tuff by the intrusion\r\nof the basalt. The upper dotted lines in the figure are inserted merely\r\nto indicate hypothetically how the cone may originally have stood.\r\nOn the west side the sheets of tuff which were thrown out over the\r\nsurrounding country have been almost entirely removed, but on the east\r\nand south they still cover an extensive area. (See Fig. 208).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 225.--Columnar basalt in the neck of Kincraig,\r\nElie, seen from the west.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 226.--Section across Largo Law.\r\n\r\n  _l_ _l_, Lower Carboniferous strata; _t_, tuff of cones; _t'_, tuff\r\n  of plain beyond the cones; B B, basalt ascending vents and sending\r\n  out veins: B', basalt which has probably flowed out at the surface.\r\n  The dotted lines are suggestive of the original outline of the hill.\r\n]\r\n\r\n(2) _Sills._--In the Clyde coal-field and in the basin of the Firth\r\nof Forth, among the vast number of sills which there traverse the\r\nCarboniferous formations, it is possible that some belong to the\r\nPermian volcanic period (see vol. i. p. 474). Where the sheets have\r\nbeen intruded along horizons that lie below the upper stratigraphical\r\nlimit of the puy eruptions, they may not unnaturally be held to belong\r\nto these manifestations of volcanic energy, though it is obviously\r\nquite conceivable that some of them may be of much later date. But\r\nwhere they lie above the highest platforms of Carboniferous lavas and\r\ntuffs, they may be assigned to a younger volcanic period. We know as\r\nyet of only two such periods after the deposition of the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone series in Scotland--Permian and older Tertiary. Unless,\r\ntherefore, these higher sills formed part of some other display\r\nof subterranean activity which is not known to have culminated in\r\neruptions at the surface, they must be looked upon as probably either\r\nPermian or Tertiary.\r\n\r\nIn the great coal-field of Stirlingshire and Lanarkshire, among the\r\nlarge sills that break into the Millstone Grit and the Coal-measures,\r\none lies entirely in the Coal-measures, and covers about six square\r\nmiles of ground, stretching from near Caldercruix Station, a little\r\neast of Airdrie, to near Kirk of Shotts, a distance of about four\r\nmiles. A group of smaller sheets, possibly connected with the larger\r\nmass, runs for four miles further west to beyond New Monkland. Another\r\nchain of sills, which may also be part of the same great intrusion,\r\nextends from the Cant Hills, near the Kirk of Shotts, for more than\r\neight miles in a north-easterly direction. The largest mass in this\r\nchain stretches from Blackridge, west of Bathgate, for upwards of three\r\nmiles, covering an area of about three square miles and terminating on\r\nthe north at the line of dislocation which has been followed by one\r\nof the east and west dykes. Another large sill, which appears nearly\r\ntwo miles further east on the north side of that dyke, lies on a lower\r\nstratigraphical horizon, for it cuts the Carboniferous Limestone\r\nseries, and does not reach the top of the Millstone Grit. This sill is\r\ncut through by two of the later dykes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 227.--Vein of \"white-trap\" cutting black\r\ncarbonaceous shales, a little west from St. Monans Church.]\r\n\r\nThat these great intrusions took place later than the deposition of\r\nthe Coal-measures is obvious. There is no satisfactory evidence to\r\nenable us to decide to which of the two post-Carboniferous volcanic\r\nperiods they may with most probability be assigned. As one of them is\r\ndistinctly cut by dykes that have been referred to the Tertiary series,\r\nit might be plausibly argued that it at least is of pre-Tertiary date,\r\nand therefore probably Permian. On the other hand, as will be shown in\r\na later chapter, some portion of the sills appears to be connected with\r\nthe younger or Tertiary dykes. This problem must for the present remain\r\nunsolved.\r\n\r\nIn Ayrshire where, as already described, basic sills traverse the\r\nPermian volcanic series, other large intrusive sheets are found around\r\nthe Permian basin. On the north side an important group of them,\r\npassing through the Coal-measures into the Carboniferous Limestone\r\nseries, runs from Troon eastward for more than eight miles to beyond\r\nCraigie. On the south side a much more extensive series may be traced\r\nfrom the River Ayr southwards into the Dalmellington coal-field, and\r\nthence north-eastwards in a wide semicircular sweep into the coal-field\r\nof New Cumnock and Airds Moss. That some of these sills proceed from\r\nthe Permian necks has been definitely ascertained, and this fact has\r\nbeen already alluded to in connection with the vents. I have little\r\ndoubt that the great majority, if not the whole, of these intrusive\r\nsheets are to be referred to the Permian period.\r\n\r\nSome of the sills must be later than a part of the Permian volcanic\r\neruptions, for they are found in at least three places intercalated in\r\nthe zone of lavas and tuffs. But no instance has been observed of their\r\ntraversing the basin of Permian sandstone which overlies that zone,\r\nthough a few dykes, possibly of Tertiary age, do cut this sandstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n                     PERMIAN VOLCANOES OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\n  The Devonshire Centre--Eruptive Rocks of the Midland\r\n  Coal-fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the south of Scotland we need to pass to the extreme south-west of\r\nEngland before we again encounter a group of volcanic rocks which may\r\nbe referred with some confidence to the Permian period. An interesting\r\ngroup of lavas and tuffs has been preserved in some of the valleys over\r\na limited area in the east of Devonshire. The Midland coal-fields,\r\nhowever, are traversed by a series of basic eruptive rocks which are\r\nyounger than the Coal-measures, and may possibly be Permian. Their mode\r\nof occurrence, and the arguments regarding their geological age, will\r\nbe given in the present chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. DEVONSHIRE\r\n\r\nThe counties of Devon and Cornwall furnish one of the most striking\r\nexamples to be met with in Britain of the persistence of volcanic\r\naction over a limited area through a long succession of geological\r\nperiods. The extensive eruptions in Devonian time were followed after\r\na long interval by a diminished series in the Carboniferous period.\r\nBut the subterranean energy was not then wholly exhausted, for it\r\nshowed itself on a feeble scale in at least one limited tract of the\r\nsame region during the Permian period. Thus throughout the later half\r\nof Palæozoic time the extreme south-west of England continued to be a\r\ntheatre of volcanic action.\r\n\r\nThe geological age of the igneous rocks now to be referred to depends\r\nupon the particular place in the geological record to which we assign\r\nthe remarkable breccias and sandstones with which they are associated.\r\nBy many geologists who have been unable to recognize any true break\r\nin the red rocks from their base up to the bottom of the Lias, these\r\nstrata have been grouped as one great series referable to the \"New\r\nRed Sandstone\" or Trias. This is the classification adopted on the\r\none-inch maps of the Geological Survey. On the other hand, various able\r\nobservers have pointed out the close resemblance of the coarse and fine\r\nbreccias at the bottom of the series to recognized Permian deposits\r\nin the centre of England and to parts of the typical Rothliegende\r\nof Germany. I need only refer to the strongly expressed views of\r\nMurchison, in which, as he stated in his _Siluria_, he \"entirely agreed\r\nwith Conybeare and Buckland, who, after a journey in Germany in 1816,\r\ndistinctly identified the Heavytree conglomerate, near Exeter, with\r\nthe Rothliegende of the Germans.\"[104] In the absence of any fossil\r\nevidence, we have only lithological characters and sequence to guide\r\nus, and though the known facts hardly warrant a very positive opinion,\r\nmy inclination is to regard these red Devonshire breccias as probably\r\nPermian, and to follow Murchison in looking upon their associated\r\nigneous masses as furnishing additional reason for assigning them to\r\nthat particular geological platform.[105]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: _Siluria_, 4th edit. (1867), p. 333. See also Berger,\r\n_Trans. Geol. Soc._ vol. i. (1811), pp. 98-102; Conybeare and Phillips,\r\n_Geology of England and Wales_, p. 313, footnote; De la Beche, _Report\r\non the Geology of Cornwall, Devon and West Somerset_ (1839), chap.\r\nvii. p. 193. Messrs. Hull and Irving (_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol.\r\nxlviii. 1892, pp. 60, 68) have more recently discussed the subject, and\r\nfollow the view of Murchison.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: Murchison cogently argued that as no signs of volcanic\r\nactivity were known in the Trias, but were abundant in the Permian\r\nsystem, the Devonshire rocks might be regarded as appertaining to the\r\nolder series, _op. cit._ Triassic volcanic rocks, however, are now well\r\nknown on the Continent.]\r\n\r\nNo proper account has yet been written of the volcanic group which\r\nI now propose to describe.[106] De la Beche was, I think, the first\r\nto recognize the true volcanic nature of the rocks and their\r\ncontemporaneous interstratification in the red sandstone series.[107] As\r\ntraced by him on the Geological Survey maps, these rocks lie at or near\r\nthe base of the red sedimentary deposits, resting sometimes directly\r\non the Culm-measures, sometimes on an intervening layer of red strata.\r\nHe found them in three separate districts in the neighbourhood of\r\nExeter, the most northerly lying near Tiverton, the central extending\r\nfrom Kellerton for a few miles up the Yeo Valley, beyond Crediton,\r\nand the third stretching from the City of Exeter to Pen Hill, about\r\nfive miles to the south-west. He recognized the amygdaloids as slaggy\r\nlavas, and saw that the volcanic breccias and tuffs are interleaved\r\nwith the sandstones. With regard to the probable vents from which these\r\nmaterials were ejected, he thought that the chief centre of activity\r\nlay at Kellerton Park, while in other localities he believed the bosses\r\nof igneous rock \"to descend in mass downwards, as if filling up some\r\ncrater or fissure through which these rocks had been vomited.\"[108] He\r\nspeaks also of \"quartziferous porphyries\" occurring among them, a\r\nstatement which, if petrographically accurate, would suggest the uprise\r\nof a later more acid lava in some of the vents.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: An outline of some of their characters will be found in a\r\npaper by Mr. W. Vicary in _Trans. Devonshire Assoc._ 1865, vol. i. part\r\niv. p. 43.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: See his \"Report\" cited in the note above. De la Beche\r\nquotes J. J. Conybeare as pointing out the intimate connection of these\r\nigneous and stratified rocks (_Annals of Philosophy_, 2nd series, vol.\r\nii. (1821) p. 165); but this author wrote at the time of the Plutonist\r\nand Neptunist controversy, and does not commit himself to any distinct\r\nexpression of opinion on the subject.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: Report, p. 201.]\r\n\r\nMore recently the ground has been revised by Mr. W. A. E. Ussher of the\r\nGeological Survey, who has ascertained that the volcanic rocks appear\r\nin many more places than those where they were noted on the older\r\nmaps, and likewise extend for some miles further to the north and west.\r\n\r\nIt now appears that in the central and chief district the lavas can\r\nbe followed westward from Spray Down near Kellerton to Greenslade\r\nnear North Tawton, a distance of about twenty-one miles. Their most\r\nnortherly outcrop is at Thorn above Loxbere in the Tiverton district,\r\nand their most southerly visible portion passes under the Cretaceous\r\nrocks of Pen Hill. The distance between these extreme points is\r\nlikewise about twenty-one miles. The whole display of volcanic\r\nphenomena is comprised within an area of less than 400 square miles.\r\n\r\nOne of the most obvious features in this volcanic tract is the way in\r\nwhich the erupted materials lie along the lines of hollow or valley in\r\nwhich the red rocks were deposited. This is most distinctly exhibited\r\nin the central district. Here a belt of breccias and sandstones,\r\nvarying from one to three and a half miles in breadth, runs for about\r\nfive and twenty miles westward in a depression of the Culm-measures.\r\nAt intervals, the lavas which lie near the base of the red rocks crop\r\nout along the margin of the belt throughout most of its extent. But\r\nthey do not spread out over the older rocks, and they have evidently\r\nbeen erupted from orifices situated along the line of the valley.\r\nIt is another example of the relation between the trend of hollows\r\nand the outbreak of volcanic vents, which I have referred to as so\r\nstrikingly displayed in the distribution of the Permian volcanic rocks\r\nof south-western Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic materials of the Devonshire Permian district consist\r\nmainly of lavas, but include also red sandy and gravelly tuffs. The\r\nwhole volcanic group is remarkably thin, never attaining even the\r\nlimited development of the Ayrshire series. No adequate petrographical\r\ninvestigation of these rocks has yet been made. Externally, as seen\r\nin the quarries and lanes, the lavas present the closest resemblance\r\nto those of the Permian basins of Ayrshire and Nithsdale. They show\r\nconsiderable differences of texture even within the same mass, some\r\nportions being dull, fine-grained purplish-red rocks, with scattered\r\npseudomorphs of hæmatite and a few porphyritic felspars, other parts\r\npassing into an exceedingly coarse amygdaloid or slaggy pumice. Dr.\r\nHatch, after a microscopical examination of a small collection of\r\nspecimens, found that while most are olivine-basalts, containing\r\nferruginous pseudomorphs after olivine (Raddon Court, Pocombe, and near\r\nBudlake), others are true andesites (Ide, Kellerton Park) and even\r\nmica-trachytes (Copplestone, near Knowle Hill).[109] As already remarked,\r\nsome of the older writers mention the existence of quartz-porphyries.[110]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: _Geol. Mag._ 1892, p. 250. The rocks have been more\r\nrecently described by Mr. B. Hobson, _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ vol.\r\nxlviii. (1892), p. 502. The rock of Kellerton Park is called by Mr.\r\nHobson \"mica-augite-andesite,\" and he gives a chemical analysis of it\r\nby Mr. E. Haworth, _op. cit._ p. 507. Mr. Watts has lately found one of\r\nthe orthoclase rocks to be rich in olivine.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: See De la Beche, _Report_, pp. 203, 204. My colleague, Mr.\r\nUssher, found close to the Thurlestone outlier of conglomerate near\r\nKingsbridge, Devonshire, a small boss of quartz-porphyry which rises\r\nthrough and alters the Devonian rocks. The actual junction of this\r\nmass with the conglomerate is not seen, nor have any fragments of the\r\nporphyry been noticed among the pebbles.\r\n\r\nMr. Ussher informs me that in the quarry the visible exposure of\r\nthe acid rock is surrounded an covered by mica-porphyrite, probably\r\nandesite.]\r\n\r\nThe geographical conditions in which the red rocks of Devonshire\r\naccumulated were those so characteristic of the Permian and Trias\r\nformations throughout Britain. The red sandstones and sandy marls\r\ngathered in inland basins, where the water seems to have become too\r\nsaline and bitter to support animal life. The strata are consequently\r\nsingularly devoid of organic remains. The climate was probably arid,\r\nand the absence or scarcity of traces of terrestrial vegetation\r\nindicates that the land around the water-basins stretched in wide\r\nsandy and rocky wastes. In the dry atmosphere and under the influence\r\nof rapid radiation the cliffs and crags of Culm-measures would\r\ndisintegrate into angular rubbish, and this material, slipping into the\r\nlakes or washed down by occasional rain-storms, forms now the breccias\r\nthat constitute so typical a feature in the Permian system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 228.--Section at Belvedere, S.W. of Exeter.\r\n\r\n_a_, Culm-measures; _b_, breccia and marls; _c_, lavas; _d_, red pebbly\r\nsandstones.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 229.--Diagram to show the unconformability and\r\noverlap of the Permian rocks in the Crediton Valley.\r\n\r\n_a_, Culm-measures; _b_, breccias and sandstones; _c_, lava-group; _d_,\r\nbreccias with fragments of lava passing up into sandstones and marls\r\n(_e_).]\r\n\r\nIt was while this geographical type continued in the South-west of\r\nEngland that the volcanic eruptions took place which we are now\r\nconsidering. De la Beche correctly referred these eruptions to the\r\nearly part of the red sandstone series. A brief examination of the\r\nground suffices to show that although, as he pointed out, the volcanic\r\nrocks lie towards the base of that series, as shown in Fig. 228, they\r\ndo not all occupy the same platform. That in some cases the lavas lie\r\ndirectly on the Culm-measures, while in others they are separated\r\nfrom these strata by 100 feet or more of red sandstones and breccias\r\n(Fig. 229), would not in itself be proof of any difference of age or\r\nstratigraphical position in the igneous rocks, for the floor on which\r\nthe Permian formations were here laid down can be shown to have been\r\nsingularly uneven. Prominent hills of Culm grit, several hundred feet\r\nhigh, rose above the basins in which the earliest Permian sediments\r\nwere deposited, and these eminences were gradually submerged and buried\r\nunder the detritus.\r\n\r\nBut that the volcanic zone includes in some places more than one\r\noutflow of lava with layers of sandstone, breccia and tuff between the\r\nsuccessive sheets may be proved in different parts of the district.\r\nThus the two conspicuous hills at Kellerton are composed of several\r\nsheets of highly slaggy lava, separated by breccia, and a third much\r\nthinner sheet lies above these, intercalated in a mass of breccia,\r\nsandstone and sandy tuff (Fig. 230). Again, at Budlake the sandstones\r\nand fine breccias include a thin band of vesicular lava, while farther\r\nto the east they are interrupted by a higher and thicker zone of\r\nsimilar material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _North Hill_ _South Hill_\r\n\r\nFig. 230.--Section of the volcanic series at Kellerton, Devonshire.\r\n\r\n_a_, Breccias and sandstones; _b_, lavas.]\r\n\r\nThese igneous sheets can be shown by many interesting sections to have\r\nbeen poured out contemporaneously with the deposit of the sedimentary\r\nmaterial among which they occur. At Crabtree, for instance, near\r\nKellerton, the uppermost lava is a thin sheet of highly slaggy texture,\r\nwhich rests immediately on the gravelly red sandstone and catches\r\nup parts of it, while the pebbles include fragments of some of the\r\nandesites below. The dark lavas are occasionally traversed by veins of\r\nfine hard sandstone, which descending from above, like those in the Old\r\nRed Sandstone and Permian lavas of Scotland, have been produced by the\r\nsilting or drifting of fine sand into cracks in the lava, before the\r\nigneous material was entirely buried. These features are well exposed\r\nin the high ridge of the Belvedere near Exeter (Fig. 228), where, over\r\na thin and inconstant band of red breccia and marl which rests on the\r\nupturned ends of the Culm-measures, a band of dull-red andesite may\r\nbe seen. This rock, partly compact and partly highly amygdaloidal, is\r\nin some portions full of irregular fissures and cavities filled with\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\nNowhere among the Palæozoic volcanic rocks of Britain are more\r\nremarkable examples of the slaggy structure to be found than in these\r\nDevonshire lavas of probably Permian age. I would especially cite the\r\nrock of Knowle Farm, a few miles to the west of Crediton, as in part a\r\nmere spongy pumice, blocks of which would originally have floated in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nOne of the best sections in the district for the exemplification of\r\nthe internal structures of these lavas is that in the large quarry at\r\nthe top of Posbury Hill. On the west side of this quarry the rock is\r\ntolerably compact, but contains vesicles and irregular steam-holes. On\r\nthe east side it passes upward and laterally into a coarse agglomerate\r\nof its own fragments, and in its mass it encloses similar agglomerate.\r\nNo sharp passage can be traced between the two rocks. So far as I could\r\njudge, it seemed to me that the lava had broken up as it moved along,\r\npossibly shattered by coming in contact with water. The agglomerate is\r\noverlain by some reddish ashy sandstone, which fills up the interstices\r\nbetween the slags, and is immediately covered by a bed of lilac\r\nandesite, marking another distinct outflow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 231.--Section of agglomerate overlain with sandstone and\r\n  andesite, Posbury, Crediton.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs in Ayrshire, the lavas of Devonshire are not accompanied by any\r\nthick accumulation of tuff. The fragmentary discharges consisted\r\nin both areas of fine dust and gravelly detritus of small lapilli,\r\nwhich were not ejected in such quantities as entirely to conceal the\r\nordinary non-volcanic sediment of the water-basin. The dust and cinders\r\nmingled with the red sand and angular scree-material, so that we now\r\nsee a group of red, somewhat ashy sandstones and breccias. Among the\r\ncomponent fragments of the breccias, a considerable variety of igneous\r\nmaterial may be observed. While the most of the non-volcanic stones\r\nmay have been derived by ordinary processes of weathering from rocks\r\nexposed at the surface, it is by no means improbable that some of them,\r\nincluding even pieces of Culm grit, killas and baked slate, may have\r\nbeen ejected from volcanic vents.[111]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: On the composition of the Devonshire breccias see Mr. R.\r\nN. Worth, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlvi. (1890), p. 69. This\r\nauthor has adopted the view that the granite of Dartmoor represents the\r\nneck of a great volcano from which these later volcanic materials were\r\nejected. But all the evidence seems to me in favour of numerous small\r\nvents situated not far from the outcrops of the lavas, as stated in\r\nthe text. See Mr. B. Hobson, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlviii.\r\n(1892), p. 498. The Dartmoor granite is later than the surrounding\r\nCarboniferous rocks, but no good evidence has been obtained to connect\r\nit with the Permian volcanic phenomena of Devonshire.]\r\n\r\nTaking the volcanic rocks of this district as a whole, I regard them\r\nas the mere edges of sheets that have flowed from vents which not\r\nimprobably lie concealed somewhere along the centres of these old\r\nPermian valleys. No visible necks have been described from any part\r\nof the area, and though I have not examined the whole of it, nothing\r\nof that nature was detected by me either in the Crediton Valley or\r\nbetween Silverton and the Exeter neighbourhood. The Tiverton district,\r\nwhich has not yet been searched, appears to be the only tract where any\r\nchance remains of finding some of the vents.\r\n\r\nNo indication of any sills has been met with among the Devonshire\r\nPermian rocks. None of the lavas which I have seen have the internal\r\ncharacters of true sills, while in the field their association with the\r\nsandstones and breccias in no observed case points to intrusion.\r\n\r\nThough much remains to be done in this region before an adequate\r\naccount can be given of the interesting series of eruptions which\r\nconcludes the long volcanic history of the South-west of England,\r\nenough is known to indicate the general character of the phenomena.\r\nThe eruptions were on even a feebler scale than those of the Permian\r\nperiod in Scotland, but they seem to have resembled them in their\r\ngeneral character. Small puy-like vents were opened, from which\r\ndark scoriaceous lavas and showers of gravelly tuff and stones were\r\ndischarged over the floor of the inland sea or lake-basin in which\r\nthe red sandstones and breccias were accumulated. These outflows and\r\nexplosions took place too, as in Scotland, towards the beginning of\r\nthe deposition of the red strata, and entirely ceased long before that\r\ndeposition came to an end. In each area the eruptions mark the close\r\nof Palæozoic volcanic activity in Britain. The varied and recurrent\r\nvolcanic episodes which distinguished each successive geological period\r\nfrom the Archæan onwards now definitely terminate, not to be resumed\r\nuntil after the passing of the whole of the vast cycle of Mesozoic ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. ERUPTIVE ROCKS IN THE MIDLAND COAL-FIELDS\r\n\r\nBetween the thick and thoroughly marine development of the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone in Derbyshire and in South Wales, there lies\r\nthe region, already referred to, wherein both the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone and Millstone Grit die out against what must have been a\r\nridge of land or group of islands that stretched in a general east\r\nand west direction from the high grounds of Wales through Shropshire,\r\nStaffordshire and Leicestershire. On the slopes of this ridge the\r\nlimestone is gradually overlapped by the Millstone Grit, and both are\r\nin turn overlapped by the Coal-measures, which are then found lying\r\nimmediately on the more ancient rocks of the region--Cambrian or\r\npre-Cambrian, Silurian and Old Red Sandstone. The gradual subsidence\r\nthat led to the deposit of several thousand feet of Carboniferous\r\nstrata over the regions to north and south, before the beginning of\r\nthe Coal-measure period, does not seem to have sensibly affected the\r\npersistence of this old terrestrial surface, which probably lay on an\r\naxis of upward movement, so that, amidst the surrounding depression,\r\nits position above water was on the whole maintained. But there are\r\nindications that the inequality of movement in this part of the earth's\r\ncrust was of much older date than the Carboniferous period. The Old Red\r\nSandstone is conformably continuous below the base of the Carboniferous\r\nsystem, and in Wales is estimated to be some 10,000 feet thick. No\r\nbreak has yet been detected in this vast accumulation of sedimentary\r\nmaterial, though it is highly probable that some such unconformability\r\nmust exist in it as that between the Scottish Lower Old Red Sandstone,\r\nwhich passes down into the Upper Silurian shales, and Upper Old Red\r\nSandstone, which graduates upward into the base of the Carboniferous\r\nformations. But even if such a break should be discovered, it will\r\nnot account for the position of the Coal-measures on Cambrian or even\r\nperhaps older rocks. It is hardly conceivable that, had these rocks\r\nbeen covered with a full development of Old Red Sandstone, they could\r\nhave been stripped of it by denudation before the deposition of the\r\nCoal-measures. It seems much more probable that the discrepancy in the\r\nterrestrial movements had commenced in Old Red Sandstone time, and that\r\nthese ridges of ancient Palæozoic rocks never sank below the waters in\r\nwhich the vast thickness of red sandstones, marls and conglomerates was\r\nlaid down.[112]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: See a discussion of this subject in Jukes' Preface to his\r\n_South Staffordshire Coal-field_.]\r\n\r\nBut apart from the question of its antiquity, this tract of persistent\r\nland has a special interest in the history of volcanic action in\r\nBritain, for it was the scene of some remarkable protrusions of\r\neruptive material which took place after a part, and possibly after\r\nthe whole, of the Coal-measures were accumulated. The date of these\r\nprotrusions cannot be fixed with greater precision; but there can be\r\nno doubt that they belong to one of the later volcanic periods in the\r\ngeological history of Britain, and the account of them is therefore\r\nincluded in the present Chapter of this work.\r\n\r\nIn the English Midlands south of Stafford, over a tract of country\r\nabout 700 square miles in extent, stretching from Birmingham on the\r\neast, across the vale of the Severn, to the uplands of Shropshire\r\non the west, the Coal-measures, partly isolated into outliers by\r\ndenudation and partly separated by overlying younger formations, are\r\npierced by masses of intrusive igneous rocks. Many of these masses\r\nhave long been familiar to geologists. Those, for example, of the\r\nClee Hills of Shropshire, and the Rowley, Barrow and Pouk Hills of\r\nStaffordshire and Worcestershire, have been frequently described, their\r\nrelations to the surrounding strata have been minutely sought out,\r\ntheir composition has been chemically determined, and their microscopic\r\nstructure has been investigated. But they have been studied rather as\r\nindividual masses of local importance. No attempt has yet been made to\r\nascertain how far they are capable of being grouped together as one\r\nconnected series, linked with each other in chemical and mineralogical\r\ncharacters, and containing a definite record in the volcanic history of\r\nthe country. This is a task which, it is to be hoped, some competent\r\ninquirer will before long undertake.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it is only possible to review here the already\r\npublished information, and to gather from it what may at present be\r\nsurmised to have been the history of these later eruptions of the\r\nMidlands.\r\n\r\nThe areas where the igneous rocks now to be described are exhibited may\r\nbe conveniently placed in the following five groups:--1st, Titterstone\r\nClee Hill; 2nd, Brown Clee Hill; 3rd, The Forest of Wyre Coal-field;\r\n4th, The Coalbrookdale Coal-field; and 5th, The South Staffordshire\r\nCoal-field.\r\n\r\n1. _The Titterstone Clee Hill_ forms a ridge about seven miles long\r\nand a mile and a quarter broad, running in a north-easterly direction\r\nover the Old Red Sandstone uplands of the south of Shropshire. The\r\nground rises gradually towards the south-west, until it reaches there a\r\nheight of 1754 feet (Fig. 232). On the north-western side of the ridge,\r\nthe last vanishing representative of the Carboniferous Limestone can\r\nbe seen to be overlapped the Millstone Grit, which, as it is traced\r\ntowards the south-west, is in turn overlapped by the Coal-measures,\r\nand these, about 400 feet thick, then rest immediately on the Old\r\nRed Sandstone. Two sheets of columnar olivine-dolerite, possibly\r\noriginally connected, lie as cakes on the summit and eastern slope\r\nof the ridge, and cover in all a space of about a square mile and a\r\nhalf. The larger sheet, which varies from 60 to 180 feet in thickness,\r\noverlies the Coal-measures, and the coals of the Cornbrook coal-field\r\nhave been worked underneath it. The smaller mass, which may be 300\r\nfeet in thickness, forms the summit of the ridge. On its eastern side\r\nit reposes on Coal-measures, which are there much disturbed; but on\r\nthe west side, where it forms a bold capping to the escarpment, it is\r\nunderlain at once by the Old Red Sandstone. There cannot be any doubt\r\nthat these masses of eruptive material are sills, which have been\r\ninjected into the Carboniferous strata, and partly between these strata\r\nand the Old Red Sandstone. One or more dykes of eruptive rock have\r\nbeen met with in mining, and the coal on approaching them undergoes\r\nalteration.[113]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: See J. R. Wright, _Trans. Geol. Soc._ (2nd ser.) iii.\r\n(1832), p. 487. Titterstone Clee Hill is shown on Sheet 55 N.E. and\r\nN.W. of the Geological Survey, and in Horizontal Sections, Sheets 33\r\nand 36, from which Fig. 232 is reduced. The microscopic structure of\r\nthe dolerite has been described by Mr. Allport, _Geol. Mag._ 1870, p.\r\n159; _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xxx. (1874), p. 550.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 232.--Diagrammatic section across Titterstone Clee\r\nHill.\r\n\r\n1. Old Red Sandstone; 2. Carboniferous Limestone; 3.

Columnar olivine-dolerite.]\r\n\r\n2. _Brown Clee Hill_ consists of two outliers of Coal-measures, each\r\nabout a mile long, placed on the summit of a broad ridge of Old Red\r\nSandstone, and rising to a height of 1800 feet above the sea. Both of\r\nthe outliers is capped with a cake of dolerite, and a third smaller\r\npatch of the same material lies on the southern outlier between the\r\ncappings. Neither at this locality nor around Titterstone Clee have any\r\neruptive rocks been observed rising through the older strata. It is\r\nevident that in both cases the orifices or fissures up which the molten\r\nmaterial rose lie concealed under the surviving cakes of dolerite.[114]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: Brown Clee Hill is mapped in Sheet 61 S.W. of the\r\nGeological Survey, and its structure is shown in Sheet 36 of the\r\nHorizontal Sections.]\r\n\r\n3. _Forest of Wyre Coal-field._--On both sides of this extensive tract\r\nof Coal-measures, the strata near the base of the series are traversed\r\nby sills or dykes of olivine-dolerite like that of the Clee Hills. The\r\nsandstones in contact with the eruptive rock have been indurated. In\r\nthis district, also, the evidence shows that the sheets are intrusive,\r\nand later than the portion of the Coal-measures there visible.[115]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: This district is represented in Sheets 55 N.E. and 61 S.E.\r\nof the Geological Survey. The microscopic structure of the larger mass\r\non the west side of the coal-field, and the variations in the minute\r\nstructure of the intrusion which forms a long ridge on the east side,\r\nare described by Mr. Allport, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xxx. pp. 550,\r\n551.]\r\n\r\n4. _Coalbrookdale Coal-field._--In this interesting district a sill of\r\nrather finely crystalline olivine-dolerite, which is estimated to be\r\nnearly 200 feet thick, is traceable from near Little Wenlock for three\r\nmiles to the north, intercalated between the Carboniferous Limestone\r\nand the Silurian rocks underneath. It appears to underlie the western\r\npart of the Coal-field, for it is exposed by denudation in several\r\nvalleys between Little Wenlock and Great Dawley. Owing to the thinning\r\nout of the Carboniferous Limestone in an easterly direction, the sill\r\ngradually comes to have the Millstone Grit on its upper surface, and at\r\none point is represented on the Geological Survey map as even intruded\r\ninto the Coal-measures. Here again we have an intrusive sheet of later\r\ndate than at least the earlier part of the Coal-measures, and no\r\nevidence of any superficial outflow of volcanic material.[116]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: The Coalbrookdale coal-field has been described by Sir\r\nJoseph Prestwich, _Trans. Geol. Soc._ (2) v. p. 428; and Prof. E. Hull,\r\n_Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ xxxiii. (1877), p. 629. The minute structure\r\nof the sill at Little Wenlock is referred to by Mr. Allport, _op. cit._\r\np. 550. The ground is mapped on Sheet 61 N.E. of the Geological Survey,\r\nand its structure is shown on Sheet 54 of the Horizontal Sections.]\r\n\r\n5. _South Staffordshire Coal-field._--This district, in respect to its\r\nigneous intercalations, has been much more fully examined and described\r\nthan any of the others. It forms the subject of an exceedingly able\r\nmemoir by Jukes, who carefully studied its geology and delineated it\r\non the maps and sections of the Geological Survey. Since his time\r\nthe rocks have been studied microscopically, but no material facts\r\nregarding the stratigraphy have been obtained in addition to those\r\nwhich he patiently collected and generalized upon.[117]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: Jukes, \"South Staffordshire Coal-field,\" _Mem. Geol.\r\nSurv._ 2nd edit. (1859). The area is embraced in Sheet 62 N.W. and S.W.\r\nof the Geological Survey, and is illustrated in Sheets 23, 24 and 25 of\r\nthe Horizontal Sections.]\r\n\r\nThis coal-field is above 20 miles long and 5 miles broad. Its strata\r\nrest unconformably on Upper Silurian strata, which, as part of the\r\nancient ridge or island already referred to, project here and there\r\nfrom amidst the Coal-measures. The boundaries of the field on the east\r\nand west sides are chiefly made by faults which bring down Permian and\r\nTriassic formations against the Carboniferous strata.\r\n\r\nThroughout this coal-field sheets of igneous rock are abundant. In\r\nthe detailed account of them given by Jukes in his admirable essay\r\non the South Staffordshire Coal-field,[118] he distinguished two kinds\r\nof igneous material--\"basalt,\" which comes out at the surface, and\r\nsometimes overlies the Coal-measures in large cakes like that of\r\nthe Rowley Hills, which extends for two miles in one direction and\r\nmore than a mile in another; and \"greenstone,\" which burrows among\r\nthe coal-bearing strata, and gives off dykes and veins of \"white\r\nrock-trap.\" There does not appear, however, to be any essential\r\ndifference in composition, age or origin between these contrasted kinds\r\nof igneous material. They not improbably all belong to one series of\r\nextrusions, their distinctions being due rather to the conditions\r\nunder which they were erupted, and in particular to their comparative\r\nthickness, and the influence of adjacent coals and carbonaceous shales\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: _Op. cit._ p. 117.]\r\n\r\nThe igneous rocks seen at the surface in this district form a series\r\nof well-marked eminences. Of these the largest extends as a ridge from\r\nDudley to beyond Rowley Regis, a distance of more than two miles. To\r\nthe west of this tract, a number of small patches of the same material\r\ncrop out at the surface, the most important forming Barrow Hill. Six\r\nmiles farther north another group of similar patches may be seen. Of\r\nthese the largest occurs at Wednesfield, but the most noted forms the\r\nPouk Hill, which has long been noted for the beauty of its columnar\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nThe sheets of \"greenstone\" met with in the coal-field are more\r\nnumerous and extensive than the detached areas of more compact rock\r\nvisible above ground, a single sheet being sometimes traceable in the\r\ncoal-workings for two miles in one direction.\r\n\r\nThe eruptive rocks of this district, when examined in their freshest\r\nform, consist of well-preserved olivine-dolerite. An examination of\r\nthe \"greenstone\" and the \"white rock-trap,\" which runs in fingers and\r\nthreads through the coal, shows that these are really the same dolerite\r\nwhich has undergone alteration, the ferruginous silicates having\r\nespecially been decomposed.[119]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: Allport, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xxx. (1874), p. 547.\r\nChemical analysis also shows the identity of the rocks and the nature\r\nof the alteration of the \"white rock.\" See Jukes, \"South Staffordshire\r\nCoal-field,\" pp. 117, 118.]\r\n\r\nThe sills of greenish decomposed material that have been injected\r\namongst and alter the coals, vary from 15 feet to 80 or 90 feet in\r\nthickness. The largest of the dolerite cakes on the surface, that of\r\nthe Rowley Hills, is somewhat irregular in its thickness, but may reach\r\nas much as 100 feet.\r\n\r\nThat nearly the whole of the igneous material is intrusive is admitted\r\nby all observers who have studied the ground. The manner in which the\r\n\"basalts\" and \"greenstones\" send out veins into the Coal-measures shows\r\nconclusively that they have been injected into the strata. The only\r\nrock about which some doubt has been expressed is that of the Rowley\r\nHills, which Jukes was disposed, though not without some hesitation,\r\nto consider as part of an actual lava-stream. He based this inference\r\nchiefly on the occurrence, immediately under the dolerite, of what\r\nhe looked upon as a \"trappean breccia or brecciated ash, containing\r\nrounded and angular fragments of igneous rock lying in a brown\r\nrather ferruginous paste, that looks like the debris of a basaltic\r\nrock.\"[120] This breccia he regarded as belonging to and passing into the\r\nCoal-measures, and he was thus inclined to regard the dolerite as a\r\nlava of Coal-measure age.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: _Op. cit._ p. 119.]\r\n\r\nIt is possible, however, that the \"trappean breccia\" may be of the\r\nsame nature as the \"uncompressed balls of basalt bedded in a mass of\r\ndecomposed basalt or basaltic 'wacke' or clay\"[121]--that is, a decayed\r\ncontact layer of the eruptive rock. But if it be regarded as the\r\nfragmental accompaniment of a lava-stream, it can hardly belong to\r\nthe Coal-measures. If the dolerite had been a lava of that age, it\r\nought to be found lying conformably on the Coal-measures. But this it\r\ndoes not appear to do. Making every allowance for the way in which an\r\nadvancing current of lava might plough up soft sediment on the bottom\r\nof the sea or of a lake, we can hardly thus account for the very uneven\r\nsurface of Coal-measures on which the sheet of igneous rock rests.\r\nIf the Rowley rock be looked upon as a lava which flowed out at the\r\nsurface, it must, I think, be assigned to a time subsequent to that of\r\nthe Coal-measures, when these strata had been upraised and had suffered\r\nsome amount of denudation. I confess, however, that the petrographical\r\ncharacters of the rock, the alteration of the coals which have been\r\nworked underneath it, and the abundant veins of \"white rock\" which\r\nthere traverse the seams, induce me to regard this rock as forming\r\nno exception to the general rule in the Midlands, but as having been\r\nintruded as a sill, now laid bare by denudation. Its fresher condition\r\nmay arise from its thickness, or from some other circumstance which has\r\nnot been ascertained.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: _Op. cit._ p. 126.]\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the probable geological date of the various\r\nintrusions of basic igneous material which can be traced over so wide\r\nan area in the centre of England. In discussing the subject, Jukes\r\npointed out that in the surrounding district \"no igneous rocks of any\r\nkind are found in any formation newer than the Coal-measures.\"[122]\r\nThis statement is, with the exception of one locality, undoubtedly\r\ntrue.[123] But on any view there must have been a long interval of time\r\nbetween the formation of the highest strata of the South Staffordshire\r\ncoal-field and that of the lowest Permian deposits of the district. It\r\nis quite conceivable, though at present incapable of proof, that the\r\nextravasation of eruptive material took place after the close of the\r\nCarboniferous period and during the earlier part of the Permian period.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: _Op. cit._ p. 131.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: See note on next page.]\r\n\r\nJukes further shows that \"at whatever period these igneous rocks were\r\nproduced, they were all existent before the production of the faults\r\nand dislocations that have traversed the Coal-measures, and before any\r\ngreat denudation had been effected on the country.\" This argument may\r\nbe readily granted. But, so far as we know, many, if not most, of the\r\nfaults traverse also the surrounding Permian and Triassic rocks, so\r\nthat igneous masses protruded during those periods would be affected by\r\nthe same dislocations.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the history of Palæozoic time in this country, and\r\nespecially the proof, obtainable everywhere else in Britain, that\r\nvolcanic energy became quiescent during the accumulation of the\r\nCoal-measures, we may well demand better evidence than has hitherto\r\nbeen forthcoming that any portion of the dolerites of the Midlands\r\nis of Carboniferous age. It is important to notice that though the\r\ndolerite sills and veins are so abundant in the South Staffordshire\r\ncoal-field, coming even in many places up to the present surface of\r\nthe ground, no single case has been observed where they rise into\r\nthe Permian rocks that overlie the Coal-measures unconformably. It\r\nis difficult to believe that, had these intrusions taken place after\r\nthe deposition of the younger formation, they should not be found\r\npenetrating it.[124] It seems almost certain that they must be of an age\r\nintermediate between the Coal-measures of South Staffordshire and the\r\nsurrounding breccias and sandstones of the Permian series. And as there\r\nis clear evidence of contemporaneous volcanic action in the lowest part\r\nof the Permian system to the north in Scotland and to the south in\r\nDevonshire, the inference seems not unreasonable that these intrusive\r\nbasalts of the Midlands are most probably of Permian age.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: Only one instance is known where in Staffordshire\r\nany igneous rock has been intruded into rocks younger than the\r\nCoal-measures (Allport, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xxx. p. 551;\r\nSheet 72 S. W. of the Geological Survey, and Horizontal Sections,\r\nSheet 57). It forms a dyke which has been traced near Norton Bridge,\r\nSwinnerton and Butterton, running for 8 miles in a N.N.W. direction,\r\nand rising through Permian, Bunter and Keuper strata. It is a highly\r\nbasic olivine-basalt, and is unquestionably a dyke. Mr. J. Kirkby,\r\nwho has recently mapped and described it (_Trans. North Staffordshire\r\nNaturalists' Field-Club_, xxviii. (1894), p. 129), suggests that it\r\nmay be connected with the igneous rocks of the South Staffordshire\r\ncoal-field. But of this idea there is no evidence. The last point to\r\nwhich the dyke has been traced is some five-and-twenty miles from the\r\nnearest known portion of the dolerites of the coal-field. I have little\r\ndoubt that this dyke is really an outlying member of the great system\r\nof Tertiary dykes described in Book VIII. of the present work.]\r\n\r\nNo trace of vents has been met with in the Coal-measures of the\r\nMidland district or among the surrounding older rocks, nor any proof\r\nthat the abundant sills and veins were connected with the eruption\r\nof volcanic materials at the surface. Nevertheless, from the analogy\r\nof the structure of these intrusive sheets to that of the sills in\r\nsuch volcanic districts as the southern half of Scotland, we may well\r\nbelieve that they were connected here and there with eruptive vents,\r\nand thus that besides the northern and southern districts of Permian\r\nvolcanoes, there rose a central group among the lagoons of the heart\r\nof England. Though no vestige of any such group has been detected, we\r\nmust remember that a large portion of the Midlands is overspread with\r\nPermian and Triassic deposits, and that much more igneous rock may be\r\nconcealed than appears at the surface. Possibly there may be buried\r\nunder these younger sheets of red sandstone and marl, lavas and tuffs\r\nwith their connected vents, such as may be seen where the Permian\r\nvolcanic series has been laid bare by denudation in Ayrshire and\r\nDevonshire. In this respect it would be interesting to make a thorough\r\nexamination of the Permian breccias of the district, with the view of\r\ndiscovering whether, though the volcanic rocks _in situ_ may still lie\r\ncovered up, fragments of them may not be found in these deposits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TO ACCOMPANY SIR ARCHIBALD GEIKIE'S \"ANCIENT VOLCANOES\r\nOF BRITAIN\"\r\n\r\nMap V.

When the last puys of the Permian series became extinct\r\na remarkable volcanic quiescence settled down on the region. This\r\ninterval of rest lasted throughout the whole of the long succession\r\nof the Mesozoic ages. Though the geological record of this section of\r\ngeological time is singularly complete in Britain, not a single vestige\r\nhas yet been found in it of any contemporaneous eruption. And what is\r\ntrue of this country is, on the whole, true of the entire European\r\ncontinent. With some trifling exceptions there were no volcanoes in\r\nEurope, so far as we know, during the enormous lapse of time between\r\nthe last of the Palæozoic and the earliest of the Tertiary eruptions.\r\n\r\nWhen the geologist attempts to form an estimate of the chronological\r\nvalue of this interval of time he is soon lost in bewilderment over its\r\nobvious vastness, and the impossibility of discovering any standards of\r\nmeasurement by which to reckon its duration. On the one hand, he sees\r\nthat it lasted long enough to admit of the gradual elaboration of many\r\nthousands of feet of various sedimentary deposits, which, from their\r\nremarkable diversities of character, were evidently accumulated, on the\r\nwhole, with extreme slowness and amidst many geographical vicissitudes.\r\nOn the other hand, he perceives that the interval sufficed to bring\r\nabout an entire change in the fauna and flora of the globe. Indeed, the\r\nmore he investigates the details of this biological transformation,\r\nthe more he is impressed with the length of time that it must have\r\nrequired. For it is not merely one complete change, but a multifold\r\nsuccession of changes. The stratigraphical records of the long array\r\nof geological periods over which it was spread show that the biological\r\nevolution advanced through a vast series of species, genera and orders\r\nwhich one by one appeared and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe ages that elapsed between the final dying out of the Palæozoic\r\nvolcanoes and the outburst of those of Tertiary time were so protracted\r\nthat many revolutions of the geography of Europe were comprised within\r\nthem. Land and sea changed places again and again. First came the\r\nsingular topography of the Trias, which prolonged and accentuated the\r\ncharacteristics of the closing Palæozoic ages. Next arose the more\r\ngenial climate and more varied geography of the Jurassic period, when\r\ncomparatively shallow seas overspread the site of most of the European\r\ncontinent, and tracts of old land stretched away to the west and north.\r\nAnother crowded succession of changes in the disposition of land and\r\nsea filled the long Cretaceous period, at the close of which a more\r\nrapid and complete transformation in European geography took place.\r\n\r\nYet during all these transitions and vicissitudes, so far as we know,\r\nvolcanic energy remained quiescent throughout Western Europe. It was\r\nnot until some time after the great terrestrial movements that raised\r\nso much of the Cretaceous sea-floor into land, and laid the foundations\r\nof the modern continent, that the subterranean fires once more awoke to\r\nvigorous action.\r\n\r\nThe renewal of eruptions in the early ages of Tertiary time was as\r\nwidespread as it was energetic. Over many regions of the European\r\ncontinent volcanoes broke out either in new areas or on old sites. For\r\nthe most part they appeared as scattered puys or as Vesuvian vents,\r\ngenerally not of the first magnitude, like those of Central France,\r\nHungary, Würtemberg and Italy. But in the north-west they assumed more\r\ncolossal proportions, and took the form of fissure-eruptions by which\r\nmany thousands of square miles of country were deluged with lava.\r\nFrom the South of Antrim all along the West of Scotland to the north\r\nof the Inner Hebrides remains of these basalt-floods form striking\r\nfeatures in the existing scenery. The same kind of rocks reappear\r\nin the Faroe Islands and in Iceland, so that an enormous tract of\r\nNorth-western Europe, much of it now submerged under the sea, was the\r\nscene of activity of the Tertiary volcanoes. In entering, therefore,\r\nupon a consideration of the British Tertiary volcanic rocks, we are\r\nbrought face to face with the records of the most stupendous succession\r\nof volcanic phenomena in the whole geological history of Europe.\r\nFortunately these records have been fully preserved in the British\r\nIsles, so that ample materials remain there for the elucidation of this\r\nlast and most marvellous of all the volcanic epochs in the evolution of\r\nthe continent.\r\n\r\nAs the remains of the Tertiary series of volcanic eruptions are the\r\nyoungest of all the volcanic records of Britain, they are naturally\r\nthe freshest and most abundantly preserved. They consequently reveal\r\nwith singular clearness multitudes of volcanic phenomena that are\r\nless distinctly recognizable, or not to be found at all, among the\r\nPalæozoic systems. Hence they will be discussed in greater detail in\r\nthe following chapters.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of their greater freshness and wider extent, and\r\nlargely also because of the way in which they have been exposed along\r\nmany leagues of picturesque sea-cliffs in the North of Ireland and the\r\nWest of Scotland, they attracted attention at an earlier time than the\r\nless obvious volcanic memorials of older ages. The gradual development\r\nof opinion regarding the nature and history of volcanic rocks is thus\r\nin no small measure bound up with the progress of observation and\r\ninference in regard to the Tertiary volcanic series. I shall therefore\r\nbegin this narrative by offering a rapid sketch of the history of\r\ninquiry respecting the Tertiary volcanic areas of the British Isles.\r\n\r\nThe basaltic cliffs of Antrim and the Inner Hebrides had attracted the\r\nnotice of passing travellers, and their striking scenery had become\r\nmore or less familiar to the reading public, before any attention\r\nwas paid to their remarkable geological structure and history. In\r\nparticular, the wonders of the Giant's Causeway and the Antrim coast\r\nhad already begun to draw pilgrims, even from distant countries, at a\r\ntime when geology had not come into existence. The scientific tourist\r\nof those days who might care to look at rocks was, in most cases, a\r\nmineralogist, for whom their structural relations and origin were\r\nsubjects that lay outside of the range of his knowledge or habits of\r\nthought. In the year 1772 Sir Joseph Banks, together with Solander and\r\na party, visited Staffa and brought back the earliest account of the\r\nmarvels of that isle as they appeared to the sober eyes of science.\r\nHis narrative was communicated to Pennant, together with a number of\r\ndrawings of the cliffs and of Fingal's Cave. These were inserted by\r\nthat geographer in his _Second Tour_, published in 1774, and from their\r\ncareful measurements of the basaltic pillars and their delineation\r\nof the basaltic structure, are of special interest in the history of\r\nvolcanic geology.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent appreciation of some of the geological interest of the\r\nregion is to be found in the writings of Whitehurst,[125] who gave a\r\ngood account of the basalt-cliffs of Antrim, and regarded the basaltic\r\nrocks as the results of successive outflows of lava from some centre\r\nnow submerged beneath the Atlantic. More important are the observations\r\ncontained in two letters of Abraham Mills.[126] This writer had been\r\nstruck with the dykes on the north coast of Ireland, and was led to\r\nexamine also those in some of the nearer Scottish islands. He believed\r\nthem to be of truly volcanic origin, and spoke of them as veins of\r\nlava. A few years later, Faujas St. Fond made his well-known pilgrimage\r\nto the Western Isles. Familiar with the volcanic rocks of Central\r\nFrance, he at once recognized the volcanic origin of the basalts of\r\nMull, Staffa and the adjoining islands.[127] His account of the journey,\r\npublished in Paris in 1797, may be taken as the beginning of the\r\nvoluminous geological literature which has since gathered round the\r\nsubject. Three years afterwards (1800) appeared Jameson's _Outline\r\nof the Mineralogy of the Scottish Isles_. Fresh from the teaching of\r\nWerner at Freiberg, the future distinguished Professor of Natural\r\nHistory in the Edinburgh University naturally saw everything in the\r\npeculiar Wernerian light. He gave the first detailed enumeration of\r\nsome of the eruptive rocks of the Hebrides, but of course ridiculed\r\nthe idea of their igneous origin. Having heard of a reported \"crater\r\nof a volcano\" near Portree, he ironically expressed a hope that \"there\r\nmay be still sufficient heat to revive the spirits of some forlorn\r\nfire-philosopher, as he wanders through this cold, bleak country.\"[128]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: _Inquiry into the Original State and Formation of the\r\nEarth_, 2nd edit. 1786.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: _Philosophical Transactions for 1790._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: _Voyage en Angleterre, en Écosse et aux Îles Hébrides._\r\nParis, 1797.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: It will be shown in a later chapter that there is a\r\nremarkably perfect volcanic vent near Portree, but the supposed crater\r\nreferred to by Jameson was probably some little corry among the sheets\r\nof basalt.]\r\n\r\nThe advent of Jameson to Edinburgh gave a fresh impetus to the warfare\r\nof the Plutonists and Neptunists, for he brought to the ranks of the\r\nlatter a mineralogical skill such as none of their Scottish opponents\r\ncould boast. The igneous origin of basalt, which the Plutonists stoutly\r\nmaintained, was as strongly denied by the other side. For some years\r\none of the most telling arguments against the followers of Hutton was\r\nderived from the alleged occurrence of fossil shells in the basalt of\r\nthe north coast of Ireland. Kirwan[129] quoted with evident satisfaction\r\nRichardson's observation of \"shells in the basalts of Ballycastle,\" and\r\nRichardson[130] himself, though the true explanation, that the supposed\r\nbasalt is only Lias shale altered by basalt, had been stated in 1802\r\nby Playfair,[131] continued for ten years afterwards to reiterate his\r\nbelief in the aqueous origin of basalt. Thus the Tertiary volcanic\r\nrocks furnished effective weapons to the combatants on both sides.\r\nThe dispute regarding the black fossiliferous rocks of Portrush had\r\nthe effect of drawing special attention to the geology of the North\r\nof Ireland. Among the more noted geologists who were led to examine\r\nthem, particular reference must be made to Conybeare and Buckland, who,\r\nin the year 1813, studied the interesting coast-sections of Antrim.\r\nThe report of their observations gives an excellent summary of the\r\narguments for the truly igneous origin of basalt, and a statement of\r\nopinion in favour of the view that the bedded basalts are the products\r\nof submarine volcanoes. Berger also about the same time described in\r\nfuller detail the geology of the Antrim district, and showed the rocks\r\nof the basalt-plateau to be younger than the Chalk. He likewise made a\r\nstudy of the basalt-dykes of the North of Ireland, and was the first\r\nto point out their prevalent north-westerly direction. The memoirs\r\nof these geologists[132] may justly be regarded, to quote the words\r\nof Portlock, as \"the first effectual step made in Irish geology.\"\r\nPortlock's own description is still the most complete summary of the\r\ngeology of that interesting region.[133]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: _Geological Essays_, 1799, p. 252, _footnote_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: Richardson lived on the Antrim coast, and had daily\r\nopportunities of examining the admirable rock-sections there exposed.\r\nIt was he who found the shells in supposed basalt, and led the\r\ngeologists of his day astray on this subject. He made a clever but\r\nirrelevant reply to Playfair's plain statement of facts (_Trans. Roy.\r\nIrish Acad._ vol. ix. 1803, p. 481). His elaborate attack on \"the\r\nVolcanic Theory\" will be found in _Trans. Roy. Irish Acad._ vol. x.\r\n(1806), pp. 35-107. Though lively enough as a specimen of controversial\r\nwriting, it forms, when seriously considered, rather a melancholy\r\nchapter in geological literature.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: _Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory_, § 252.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: They are contained in the third volume of the\r\n_Transactions of the Geological Society_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: \"Report on the Geology of the County of Londonderry and\r\nparts of Tyrone and Fermanagh,\" _Mem. Geol. Survey_, 1843.]\r\n\r\nWhile such advances were being made in the knowledge of the structure\r\nof the volcanic rocks of the North of Ireland, the geologist had\r\nalready appeared who was the first to attempt a systematic examination\r\nof the Western Islands, and whose published descriptions are still a\r\nchief source of information regarding the geology of this extensive\r\nregion. Dr. Macculloch seems to have made his first explorations among\r\nthe Hebrides some time previous to the year 1814, for in that year he\r\npublished some remarks on specimens from that district transmitted to\r\nthe Geological Society.[134] For several years in succession he devoted\r\nhimself with great energy and enthusiasm to the self-imposed task of\r\ngeologically examining and mapping in a generalized way all the islands\r\nthat lie to the westward of Scotland, from the remote St. Kilda even\r\nas far as the Isle of Man. From time to time, notices of parts of his\r\nwork were given in the _Transactions of the Geological Society_. But\r\neventually in 1819 he embodied the whole in his _Description of the\r\nWestern Islands of Scotland, including the Isle of Man_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: _Trans. Geol. Soc._ vol. ii. 1814.]\r\n\r\nThis great classic marks a notable epoch in British geology. Properly\r\nto estimate its value, we should try to realize what was the state\r\nof the science in this country at the time of its appearance. So\r\nlaborious a collection of facts, and so courageous a resolution\r\nto avoid theorizing about them, gave to his volumes an altogether\r\nunique character. His descriptions were at once adopted as part of\r\nthe familiar literature of geology. His sections and sketches were\r\nreproduced in endless treatises and text-books. Few single works of\r\ndescriptive geology have ever done so much to advance the progress of\r\nthe science in this country. With regard to the special subject of the\r\npresent memoir, Macculloch showed that the basalts and other eruptive\r\nrocks of the Inner Hebrides pierce and overlie the Secondary strata\r\nof these islands, and must therefore be of younger date. But though\r\nhe distinguished the three great series of \"trap-rocks,\" \"syenites\"\r\nand \"hypersthene-rocks\" or \"augite-rocks,\" and indicated approximately\r\ntheir respective areas, he did not attempt to unravel their relations\r\nto each other. Nor did he venture upon any speculations as to the\r\nprobable conditions under which these rocks were produced. He claimed\r\nthat those who might follow him would find a great deal which he\r\nhad not described, but little that he had not examined. Subsequent\r\nobservers have noted many important facts, of which, had he observed\r\nthem, he would at once have seen the meaning, and which he certainly\r\nwould not have passed over in silence. But as a first broad outline\r\nof the subject, Macculloch's work possesses a great value, which is\r\nnot lessened by the subsequent discovery of details that escaped his\r\nnotice, and of important geological relations which he failed to detect.\r\n\r\nIt has already been pointed out that some of the earliest and ablest\r\nobservations among the volcanic rocks of this country, especially in\r\nScotland, were made by foreigners. Students who had repaired from\r\nabroad to Edinburgh for education sometimes caught the geological\r\nenthusiasm, then so marked in that city, and made numerous journeys\r\nthrough the country in search of further knowledge of Scottish rocks\r\nand minerals. In other instances, geologists of established reputation,\r\nattracted by the interest which the published accounts of the geology\r\nof Scotland had excited, were led to visit the country and to record\r\ntheir impressions of its rock-structure. Of the first class of\r\nobservers the two most noted were Ami Boué and L. A. Necker; of the\r\nsecond, special acknowledgment is due to Faujas St. Fond and to Von\r\nOyenhausen and Von Dechen.\r\n\r\nThe labours of Boué[135] have already been referred to in connection with\r\nthe literature of the Scottish Old Red Sandstone (vol. i. p. 269). In\r\nhis treatment of the Tertiary Volcanic series of Scotland he appears to\r\nhave relied mainly on the then recently published volumes of Macculloch.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: _Essai géologique sur l'Écosse._ Paris, 1820.]\r\n\r\nL. A. Necker, as the grandson of the illustrious De Saussure, had\r\nstrong claims on the friendly assistance of the School of Geology\r\nat Edinburgh when he went thither in 1806, at the age of twenty, to\r\nprosecute his studies. He was equally well received by the Plutonists\r\nand Neptunists, and devoted some time to the exploration of the geology\r\nnot only of the Lowlands, but of the Highlands and the Inner Hebrides.\r\nMost of his observations appear to have been made in the year 1807,\r\nbut it was not until fourteen years afterwards that he published the\r\naccount of them.[136] The geological part of this work must be admitted\r\nto be somewhat disappointing. The author's caution not to commit\r\nhimself to either side of the geological controversy then waging makes\r\nhis descriptions and explanations rather colourless. He adds little to\r\nwhat was previously known. Even as regards the origin of the basalts\r\nof the Western Islands, he could not make up his mind whether or not\r\nto regard them as volcanic, but contented himself by referring them to\r\n\"the trappean formation.\" Yet these islands had so fascinated him that\r\neventually he returned to them as his adopted home, passed the last\r\ntwenty years of his life among them, and died and was buried there.\r\nBesides his _Voyage_, he published in French an account of the dykes of\r\nthe Island of Arran.[137]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: _Voyage en Écosse et aux Îles Hébrides._ See also\r\nbiographical notice of L. A. Necker, by Principal J. D. Forbes, _Proc.\r\nRoy. Soc. Edin._ v. (1862), p. 53.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xiv. (1840), p. 667.]\r\n\r\nAmong the foreign geologists who have been drawn to the Scottish\r\nmountains and islands by the interest of their Tertiary volcanic rocks,\r\nI have already spoken of Faujas St. Fond. Much more important, however,\r\nwere the observations made some thirty years later by two German men\r\nof science, Von Oyenhausen and Von Dechen. Their careful descriptions\r\nof the geology of Skye, Eigg and Arran added new materials to the\r\nknowledge already acquired by native geologists.[138] To some of the more\r\ninteresting parts of their work reference will be made in later pages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: Karsten's _Archiv_ (1829), vol. i. p. 56.]\r\n\r\nThe numerous trap-dykes of Northumberland, Durham and Northern\r\nYorkshire at an early date attracted the attention of geologists.\r\nAs far back as 1817, they had been the subject of a memoir by N. J.\r\nWinch,[139] who gave an account of their effects on the adjacent rocks.\r\nMore important were the subsequent papers on the same subject by\r\nSedgwick, who, discussing the lithological characters, probable origin\r\nand geological age of the dykes, pointed out that while the Cleveland\r\ndyke was undoubtedly younger than a large part of the Jurassic rocks,\r\nthere was no direct evidence to determine whether dykes farther north\r\nwere earlier or later than the time of the Magnesian Limestone.[140]\r\nSubsequent accounts of the dykes of the same region were given by\r\nBuddle,[141] M. Forster,[142] N. Wood,[143] H. T. M. Witham,[144] Tate\r\n[145] and others, while in more recent years important additions to our\r\nknowledge of these dykes and of their effects have been made by Sir J.\r\nLowthian Bell[146] and Mr. J. J. H. Teall.[147]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: _Trans. Geol. Soc._ vol. iv. (1817), p. 21. See also\r\nTilloch's _Phil. Mag._ vols. xlix. and l.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: _Cambridge Phil. Trans._ vol. ii.

Geol. Soc._ xl. (1884), p. 209.]\r\n\r\nThe geological age of the great series of Tertiary volcanic rocks has\r\nonly been determined district by district, and at wide intervals.\r\nThat some part of the Antrim basalts is younger than the Chalk of\r\nthat region was clearly shown by Berger, Conybeare and Buckland.\r\nPortlock, however, referred to the occurrence of detached blocks of\r\nbasalt which he supposed to be immersed in the Chalk near Portrush,\r\nand which inclined him to believe that \"the basaltic flows commenced\r\nat a remote period of the Cretaceous system.\"[148] Macculloch showed\r\nthat the corresponding basaltic plateaux of the Inner Hebrides were\r\ncertainly younger than the Oolitic rocks of that region. But no\r\nnearer approximation to their date had yet been made when in the year\r\n1850 the Duke of Argyll announced the discovery of strata containing\r\nfossiliferous chalk-flints and dicotyledonous leaves, lying between\r\nthe bedded basalts of Ardtun Head, in the Isle of Mull.[149] In the\r\nfollowing year these fossil leaves were described by Edward Forbes, who\r\nregarded them as decidedly Tertiary, and most probably Miocene. This\r\nwas the first palæontological evidence for the determination of the\r\ngeological age of any portion of the basalt-plateaux, and it indicated\r\nthat the basalts of the south-west of Mull were of older Tertiary date.\r\nTaken also in connection with the occurrence of lignite-beds between\r\nthe basalts of Antrim, it suggested that these volcanic plateaux\r\nwere not due to submarine eruptions, as the earlier geologists had\r\nsupposed, but were rather the result of the subærial outpouring of lava\r\nat successive intervals, during which terrestrial vegetation sprang up\r\nupon the older outflows.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: _Report on the Geology of Londonderry_, p. 93. There\r\ncan be no doubt that this was an error of observation. The Antrim\r\nbasalts are all certainly younger than the Chalk. The supposed \"lumps\r\nof basalt\" were probably the ends of veins intruded into the Chalk,\r\nand perhaps partially disconnected from the main parts of the veins.\r\nSuch apparently detached masses of intrusive rock are not infrequent\r\noccurrence in connection with the Tertiary intrusive sills. An example\r\nwill be found represented in Fig. 321.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: _Brit. Assoc. Report_, 1850, Sections, p. 70; and _Quart.\r\nJour. Geol. Soc._ vii. (1851), p. 87.]\r\n\r\nWhile Forbes brought forward palæontological proofs of the Tertiary\r\nage of the volcanic rocks of the south-west of Mull, he at the same\r\ntime laid before the Geological Society a paper on the Estuary Beds\r\nand the Oxford Clay of Loch Staffin, in Skye, wherein, while admitting\r\nthe existence of appearances which might be regarded as favourable to\r\nthe view that the intercalated basalts of that region were of much\r\nlater date than the Oolitic strata between which they might have been\r\nintrusively injected, he stated his own belief that they were really\r\ncontemporaneous with the associated stratified rocks, and thus marked\r\nan outbreak of volcanic energy at the close of the Middle Oolitic\r\nperiod.[150] The Duke of Argyll, in the paper which he on the same\r\noccasion communicated to the Geological Society, adopted this view\r\nof the probable age of most of the basalts of the Western Islands.\r\nHe looked upon the Tertiary volcanic rocks of Mull as occupying a\r\nrestricted area, the great mass of the basalt of that island, like that\r\nof Skye, being regarded by him as probably not later than some part of\r\nthe Secondary period.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. vii. (1851), p. 104.]\r\n\r\nIt must be granted that the appearances of contemporaneous\r\nintercalation of the basalt among the Secondary strata are singularly\r\ndeceptive. When, several years after the announcement of the Tertiary\r\nage of the basalts of Ardtun, I began my geological work in the Inner\r\nHebrides, I was led to the same conclusion as Edward Forbes, and\r\nexpressed it in an early paper.[151] All over the north of Skye I traced\r\nwhat appeared to be evidence of the contemporaneous interstratification\r\nof basalts with the Jurassic rocks and I concluded (though with some\r\nreservation) that the whole of the vast basaltic plateaux of that\r\nisland were not younger than some late part of the Jurassic period. In\r\nthat same paper the attention of geologists was called to the probable\r\nconnection of the great system of east-and-west dykes traversing\r\nScotland and the North of England, with the basalt-plateaux of the\r\nInner Hebrides, and as I believed the latter to be probably of the\r\nage of the Oolitic rocks, I assigned the dykes to the same period in\r\ngeological history. But subsequent explorations enabled me to correct\r\nthe mistake into which, with other geologists, I had fallen regarding\r\nthe age of the volcanic phenomena of the Western Islands. In 1867 I\r\nshowed that instead of being confined to a mere corner of Mull, the\r\nTertiary basalts, with younger associated trachytic or granitic rocks,\r\ncovered nearly the whole of that island, and that in all likelihood\r\nthe long chain of basaltic masses, extending from the North of Ireland\r\nalong the west coast of Scotland to the Faroe Islands, and beyond\r\nthese to Iceland, was all erupted during the Tertiary period. At the\r\nsame time I drew special attention to the system of east-and-west\r\ndykes as proofs of the vigour of volcanic action at that period, and\r\nI furnished evidence that this action was prolonged through a vast\r\ninterval of time, during which great subærial denudation of the older\r\nlavas took place before the outflow of the younger.[152] Later in the\r\nsame year, in an address to the Geological Section of the British\r\nAssociation, I reiterated these views, and more particularly emphasized\r\nthe importance of the system of dykes, which in my opinion was possibly\r\nthe most striking manifestation of the vigour of Tertiary volcanic\r\naction.[153] In 1871, after further explorations in the field, I gave a\r\ndetailed account of the structure which had led to the mistake as to\r\nthe age of the Tertiary volcanic rocks of the Western Islands; and in\r\na description of the island of Eigg, I brought forward data to show\r\nthe enormous duration of the Tertiary volcanic period in the west of\r\nBritain.[154]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: \"On the Chronology of the Trap-rocks of Scotland,\"\r\n_Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ xxii. (1861), p. 649.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: _Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vi. (1867), p. 71.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: _Brit. Assoc. Report_ (Dundee), 1867, Sections, p. 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xxvii. (1871), p. 279.]\r\n\r\nThree years later Mr. J. W. Judd read before the Geological Society\r\na paper \"On the Ancient Volcanoes of the Highlands.\"[155] The most\r\nnovel feature of this paper was the announcement that the author had\r\nrecognized the basal wrecks of five great central volcanoes in the\r\nWestern Islands, among which that of Mull was inferred by him to have\r\nbeen at least 14,500 feet high. He was led to the conclusion that the\r\nvolcanic period in these regions was divisible into three sections--the\r\nfirst marked by the outburst of acid rocks (felspathic lavas and ashes,\r\nconnected with deeper and more central granitic masses); the second by\r\nthe extrusion of basic lavas and tuffs (the basaltic plateaux); the\r\nthird by the appearance of small sporadic volcanic cones (\"felspathic,\r\nbasaltic, or intermediate in composition\") after the great central\r\ncones had become extinct. It will be seen in the following pages\r\nthat these conclusions of Professor Judd are not supported by a more\r\ndetailed study of the region.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xxx. (1874), p. 220.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1879, during a traverse of some portions of the volcanic\r\nregion of Wyoming, Montana and Utah, I was vividly impressed by\r\nthe identity of structure between the basaltic plateaux of these\r\nterritories and the youngest volcanic areas of Britain. It then\r\nappeared to me that some of the puzzling features in the Tertiary\r\nvolcanic series of the Inner Hebrides might be explained by the\r\nstructures so admirably displayed in these lava-fields of the Far\r\nWest.[156] Riding over the great basalt-plains of the Snake River and\r\nlooking at the sections cut by the river through the thick series\r\nof horizontal basalt-beds, I appreciated for the first time the\r\nsignificance of Baron von Richthofen's views regarding \"massive\"\r\nor \"fissure\" eruptions, as contradistinguished from those of great\r\ncentral cones of the type of Etna or Vesuvius, and I gathered so\r\nmany suggestions from my examination of these American regions that\r\nI renewed with increased interest the investigation of the Tertiary\r\nvolcanic tracts of Britain. At last, after another interval of nine\r\nyears, during which my weeks of leisure were given to the task, I was\r\nable to complete a discussion of the whole history of Tertiary volcanic\r\naction in this country, which was communicated to the Royal Society\r\nof Edinburgh in the early summer of 1888.[157] Since that time I have\r\ncontinued the research, and have from time to time communicated my\r\nresults to the Geological Society. These various memoirs are combined\r\nwith hitherto unpublished details in the following account of the\r\nBritish Tertiary Volcanic Rocks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: _Geological Essays at Home and Abroad_ (1882), pp. 271,\r\n274; _Nature_, November 1880.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxxv. part ii. (1888), pp.\r\n23-184.]\r\n\r\nProfessor Judd has also prosecuted the investigation of the petrography\r\nof the rocks, and has published his observations in the _Quarterly\r\nJournal of the Geological Society_.[158] To these papers by him more\r\ndetailed reference will be made in later Chapters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vols. xlv. (1889), xlvi.\r\n(1890), xlix. (1893). In the first of these volumes Professor Judd\r\noffered a detailed criticism of my views as to the order of succession\r\nand history of the volcanic rocks of the Inner Hebrides. Subsequent\r\ninvestigation having entirely confirmed my main conclusions, it is\r\nnot necessary to enter here upon matters of controversy. Reference,\r\nhowever, will be made in subsequent Chapters to some of the points in\r\ndispute.]\r\n\r\nIn describing the geological history of a great series of rocks,\r\nchronological order is usually the most convenient method of treatment.\r\nWhere, however, the rocks are of volcanic origin, and do not always\r\nprecisely indicate their relative age, and where moreover the same\r\nkinds of rock may appear on widely-separated geological horizons, it\r\nis not always possible or desirable to adhere to the strict order\r\nof sequence. With this necessary latitude, I propose to follow the\r\nchronological succession from the older to the newer portions of the\r\nseries. I shall treat first of the system of dykes, by which so large a\r\npart of Scotland and of the north of England and Ireland is traversed.\r\nMany of the dykes are undoubtedly among the youngest members of the\r\nvolcanic series, and in no case has their age been as yet determined\r\nexcept relatively to the antiquity of the rocks which they traverse.\r\nThey must, of course, be posterior to these rocks, and hence it would\r\nbe quite logical to reserve them for discussion at the very end of the\r\nwhole volcanic phenomena. My reason for taking them at the beginning\r\nwill be apparent in the sequel. After the dykes, I shall describe the\r\ngreat volcanic plateaux which, in spite of vast denudation, still\r\nsurvive in extensive fragments in Antrim, the Inner Hebrides and the\r\nFaroe Islands. The eruptive bosses of basic rocks that have broken\r\nthrough the plateaux will next be discussed. An account will then be\r\ngiven of the protrusions of acid rocks which have disrupted these basic\r\nbosses. The last chapters will contain a sketch of the subsidences\r\nand dislocations which the basalt-plateaux have suffered, and of the\r\ndenudation to which they have been subjected.\r\n\r\nAs has been explained in Chapter iii., the volcanic cycle of any\r\ndistrict, during a given geological period, embraces the whole range of\r\nerupted products from the beginning to the end of a complete series of\r\neruptions. Reference was made in Book I. to the remarkable variation\r\nin the character of the lavas successively poured out from the same\r\nvolcanic reservoir during the continuance of a single cycle, and it was\r\npointed out that Richthofen's law generally holds good that while the\r\nfirst eruptions may be of a basic or average and intermediate nature,\r\nthose of succeeding intervals become progressively more acid, but are\r\noften found to return again at the close to thoroughly basic compounds.\r\n\r\nThis law is well illustrated by the volcanic history of Tertiary time\r\nin Britain. We shall find that the earliest eruptions of which the\r\nrelative date is known consisted generally of basic lavas (dolerites\r\nand basalts), but including also more sparingly andesites, trachytes\r\nand rhyolites; that the oldest intrusive masses consisted of bosses,\r\nsills and dykes of dolerite and gabbro; that these intrusions\r\nwere followed by others of a much more acid character--felsites,\r\npitchstones, quartz-porphyries or rhyolites, granophyres and granites;\r\nthat the latest lava is a somewhat acid rock, being a vitreous form of\r\ndacite; and that the most recent volcanic products of all are dykes of\r\na thoroughly basic nature, like some of the earlier intruded masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n          THE SYSTEM OF DYKES IN THE TERTIARY VOLCANIC SERIES\r\n\r\n  Geographical Distribution--Two Types of Protrusion--Nature\r\n  of Component Rocks--Hade--Breadth--Interruptions of Lateral\r\n  Continuity--Length--Persistence of Mineral Characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a geologist were asked to select that feature in the volcanic\r\ngeology of the British Isles which, more than any other, marks this\r\nregion off from the rest of the European area, he would probably choose\r\nthe remarkable system of wall-like masses of erupted igneous rock, to\r\nwhich the old Saxon word \"dykes\" has been affixed. From the moors of\r\neastern Yorkshire to the Perthshire Highlands, and from the basins of\r\nthe Forth and Tay to the west of Donegal and the far headlands of the\r\nHebrides, the country is ribbed across with these singular protrusions\r\nto such an extent that it may be regarded as a typical region for the\r\nstudy of the phenomena of dykes. That all the dykes in this wide tract\r\nof country are of Tertiary age cannot be maintained. It has been shown\r\nin previous Chapters that each of the great volcanic periods has had\r\nits system of dykes, even as far back as the time of the Lewisian\r\nGneiss.\r\n\r\nBut when all the dykes which can reasonably be referred to older\r\ngeological periods are excluded, there remains a large series which\r\ncannot be so referred, but which are connected together by various\r\nkinds of evidence into one great system that must be of late geological\r\ndate, and can be assigned to no other than the Tertiary period in the\r\nvolcanic history of Britain. As far back as the year 1861, when I first\r\ndrew attention to this great system of dykes in connection with the\r\nprogress of volcanic action in the country, I pointed out the grounds\r\non which it seemed to me that these rocks belong to a comparatively\r\nrecent geological period.[159] My own subsequent experience and the full\r\ndetails of structure collected by my colleagues of the Geological\r\nSurvey in all parts of the country, have amply confirmed this view.\r\nThe characters which link this great series of dykes together as one\r\nconnected system of late geological date are briefly enumerated in the\r\nfollowing list, and will be more fully discussed in later pages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxii. (1861), p. 650.]\r\n\r\n1. The prevalent tendency of the dykes to take a north-westerly\r\ncourse. There are exceptions to this normal trend, especially where\r\nthe dykes are small and locally numerous; but it remains singularly\r\ncharacteristic over the whole region.\r\n\r\n2. The increasing abundance of the dykes as they are traced to the west\r\ncoast and the line of the great Tertiary volcanic plateaux of Antrim\r\nand the Inner Hebrides.\r\n\r\n3. The rectilinear direction so characteristic of them and so different\r\nfrom the tortuous course of local groups of dykes. The exceptions to\r\nthis normal feature are as a rule confined to the same localities where\r\ndepartures from the prevalent westerly trend occur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 233.--Dyke on the south-east coast of the Island of\r\nMull.]\r\n\r\n4. The great breadth of the larger dykes of the system and their\r\npersistence for long distances. This is one of their most remarkable\r\nand distinctive characters.\r\n\r\n5. The posteriority of the dykes to the rest of the geological\r\nstructure of the regions which they traverse. They are not only younger\r\nthan the other rocks, but younger than nearly all the folds and faults\r\nby which the rocks are affected.\r\n\r\n6. The manner in which they cut the Jurassic, Cretaceous and older\r\nTertiary rocks in the districts through which they run. At the\r\nsouth-eastern end of the region they rise through the Lias and Oolite\r\nformations, in the west they intersect the Chalk and also the Tertiary\r\nvolcanic plateaux together with their later eruptive bosses.\r\n\r\n7. Their petrographical characters, among which perhaps the most\r\ndistinctive is the frequent appearance of the original glass of the\r\nplagioclase-pyroxene-magnetite (olivine) rock, of which they mostly\r\nconsist. This glass, or its more or less completely devitrified\r\nrepresentative, often still recognizable with the microscope among the\r\nindividualized microlites and crystals throughout the body of a dyke,\r\nis also not infrequent as a black vitreous varnish-like coating on the\r\nouter walls, and occasionally appears in strings and veins even in the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\nIt is the assemblage of dykes presenting these features which I propose\r\nto describe. Obviously, the age of each particular dyke can only be\r\nfixed relatively for itself. But when this remarkable community of\r\ncharacters is considered, and when the post-Mesozoic age of at least a\r\nvery large number of the dykes can be demonstrated, the inference is\r\nreasonable that one great system of dykes was extravasated during a\r\ntime of marked volcanic disturbance, which could not have been earlier\r\nthan the beginning of the Tertiary period. And this inference may be\r\nmaintained even when we frankly admit that every dyke within the region\r\nis by no means claimed as belonging to the Tertiary series.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 234.--Fissure left by the weathering out of a dyke.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of their number and the extraordinary volcanic activity to\r\nwhich they bear witness, the dykes form a much less prominent feature\r\nin the landscape than might have been anticipated. In the lowlands of\r\nthe interior, they have for the most part been concealed under a cover\r\nof superficial accumulations, though in the water-courses they not\r\ninfrequently project as hard rocky barriers across the channels, and\r\noccasionally form picturesque waterfalls. On the barer uplands, they\r\nprotrude in lines of broken crag and scattered boulders, which by their\r\ndecay give rise to a better soil covered by a greener vegetation than\r\nthat of the surrounding brown moorland. Among the Highland hills, they\r\nare often traceable from a distance as long black ribs that project\r\nfrom the naked faces of crag and corry. Along the sea-coast, their\r\npeculiarities of scenery are effectively displayed. Where they consist\r\nof a close-grained rock, they often rise from the beach as straight\r\nwalls which, with a strangely artificial look, mount into the face\r\nof the cliffs on the one side, and project in long black reefs into\r\nthe sea on the other (Fig. 233). Every visitor to the islands of the\r\nClyde will remember how conspicuous such features are there. But it is\r\namong the Inner Hebrides that this kind of scenery is to be found in\r\ngreatest perfection. The soft dark Lias shales of the island of Pabba,\r\nfor example, are ribbed across with scores of dykes which strike boldly\r\nout to sea. Where, on the other hand, the material of the dykes is\r\ncoarse in grain, or is otherwise more susceptible to the disintegrating\r\ninfluences of the weather, it has often rotted away and left yawning\r\nclefts behind, the vertical walls of which are those of the fissures\r\nup which the molten rock ascended (Fig. 234). Some good instances of\r\nthis kind are well known to summer visitors on the eastern shores of\r\nArran. Others, on a large scale, may be seen in the interior of the\r\nsame island along the crests of the granite ridges, and still more\r\nconspicuously on the jagged summits of Blath Beinn and the Cuillin\r\nHills (Fig. 333), and intersecting the Jurassic strata along the cliffs\r\nof Strathaird in Skye.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThe limits of the region within which the dykes occur cannot be very\r\nprecisely fixed. There can be no doubt, however, that on their southern\r\nside they reach to the Cleveland Hills of Yorkshire and the southern\r\nborders of Lancashire, perhaps even as far as North Staffordshire (p.\r\n106), and on the northern side to the farther shores of the island of\r\nLewis--a direct distance of 360 miles. They stretch across the basin of\r\nthe Irish Sea, including the Isle of Man, and appear in Ireland north\r\nof a line drawn from Dundalk Bay to the Bays of Sligo and Donegal.\r\nDykes are of frequent occurrence over the north of England and south\r\nof Scotland, at least as far north as a line drawn from the coast of\r\nKincardineshire along the southern flank of the Grampian Hills, by\r\nthe head of Glen Shee and Loch Tay, to the north-western coast of\r\nArgyleshire. They abound all along the line of the Inner Hebrides and\r\non parts of the adjacent coasts of the mainland, from the remoter\r\nheadlands of Skye to the shores of County Louth. They traverse also the\r\nchain of the Long Island in the Outer Hebrides. So far as I am aware,\r\nthey are either absent or extremely rare in the Highlands north of the\r\nline I have indicated. But a good many have been found by my colleagues\r\nin the course of the Geological Survey of the northern lowlands of\r\nAberdeenshire and Banffshire. The longest of these has been traced by\r\nMr. L. Hinxman for rather more than two miles running in a nearly east\r\nand west direction through the Old Red Sandstone of Strathbogie, with\r\nan average width of about 35 feet. Another in the same district has a\r\nwidth of from 45 to 90 feet, and has been followed for a third of a\r\nmile. But far beyond these northern examples, I have found a number of\r\nnarrow basalt-veins traversing the Old Red flagstones of the Mainland\r\nof Orkney, which I have little doubt are also a prolongation of the\r\nsame late series. Taking, however, only those western and southern\r\ndistricts in which the younger dykes form a notable feature in the\r\ngeology, we find that the dyke-region embraces an area of upwards of\r\n40,000 square miles--that is, a territory greater than either Scotland\r\nor Ireland, and equal to more than a third of the total land-surface of\r\nthe British Isles (Map I.).\r\n\r\nOf this extensive region the greater portion has now been mapped in\r\ndetail by the Geological Survey. Every known dyke has been traced,\r\nand the appearances it presents at the surface have been recorded. We\r\nare accordingly now in possession of a larger body of evidence than\r\nhas ever before been available for the discussion of this remarkable\r\nfeature in the geology of the British Isles. I have made use of this\r\ndetailed information, and besides the data accumulated in my own\r\nnote-books, I have availed myself of those of my colleagues in the\r\nSurvey, for which due acknowledgment is made where they are cited.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary basalt-plateaux of Britain have their counterpart in\r\nthe Faroe Islands and in Iceland, and whether or not the lava-fields\r\nstretched throughout North-western Europe from Antrim to the farthest\r\nheadlands of _Ultima Thule_, there can hardly be any doubt that,\r\nif not continuous, these volcanic areas were at least geologically\r\ncontemporaneous in their activity. Their characteristic scenery and\r\nstructure are prolonged throughout the whole region, reappearing with\r\nall their familiar aspects alike in Faroe and in Iceland. I have not\r\nseen the latter island, but in the Faroe archipelago I have found the\r\ndykes to be sufficiently common, and to cut the basalt-plateaux there\r\nin the same way as they do those of the Inner Hebrides. On the whole,\r\nhowever, dykes do not play, in these northern isles, the important part\r\nwhich they take in the geology and scenery of the West of Scotland. I\r\nhave not had sufficient opportunity to ascertain whether there is a\r\ngeneral direction or system among the Faroe dykes. In the fjords north\r\nof Thorshaven, and again along the west side of Stromö, many of them\r\nshow an E. and W. strike or one from E.N.E. to W.S.W.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. TWO TYPES OF PROTRUSION\r\n\r\nThe dykes are far from being equally distributed over the wide region\r\nwithin which they occur. In certain limited areas they are crowded\r\ntogether, sometimes touching each other to the almost entire exclusion\r\nof the rocks through which they ascend, while elsewhere they appear\r\nonly at intervals of several miles. Viewed in a broad way, they may\r\nbe conveniently grouped in two types, which, though no hard line can\r\nbe drawn between them, nevertheless probably point to two more or\r\nless distinct phases of volcanic action and to more than one period\r\nof intrusion. In the first, which for the sake of distinction we may\r\nterm the Solitary type, there is either a single dyke separated from\r\nits nearest neighbours by miles of intervening and entirely dykeless\r\nground, or a group of two or more running parallel to each other, but\r\nsometimes a mile or more apart. The rock of which they consist is,\r\non the whole, less basic than in the second type; it includes the\r\nandesitic varieties. It is to this type that the great dykes of the\r\nnorth of England and the south and centre of Scotland belong. The\r\nCleveland dyke, for example, at its eastern end has no known dyke near\r\nit for many miles. The coal-field of Scotland is traversed by five\r\nmain dykes, which run in a general sense parallel to each other, with\r\nintervals of from half a mile to nearly five miles between them. Dykes\r\nof this type display most conspicuously the essential characters of\r\nthe dyke-structure, in particular the vertical marginal walls, the\r\nparallelism of their sides, their great length, and their persistence\r\nin the same line.\r\n\r\nIn the second, or what for brevity may be called the Gregarious type,\r\nthe dykes occur in great abundance within a particular district. They\r\nare on the whole narrower, shorter, less strikingly rectilinear,\r\nmore frequently tortuous and vein-like, and generally more basic in\r\ncomposition than those of the first type. They include the true basalts\r\nand dolerites. Illustrative districts for dykes of this class are the\r\nislands of Arran, Mull, Eigg and Skye.\r\n\r\nThe great single or solitary dykes may be observed to increase in\r\nnumber, though very irregularly, from south to north, and also in\r\nCentral Scotland from east to west. They are specially abundant in the\r\ntract stretching from the Firth of Clyde along a belt of country some\r\nthirty miles broad on either side of the Highland line, as far at least\r\nas the valley of the Tay. They form also a prominent feature in the\r\nislands of Jura and Islay.\r\n\r\nDykes of the gregarious type are abundantly and characteristically\r\ndisplayed in the basin of the Firth of Clyde. Their development in\r\nArran formed the subject of the interesting paper by Necker, already\r\nmentioned, who catalogued and described 149 of them, and estimated\r\ntheir total number in the whole island to be about 1500.[160] As the\r\narea of Arran is 165 square miles, there would be, according to this\r\ncomputation, about nine dykes to every square mile. But they are far\r\nfrom being uniformly distributed. While appearing only rarely in many\r\ninland tracts, they are crowded together along the shore, particularly\r\nat the south end of the island, where the number in each square mile\r\nmust far exceed the average just given. The portion of Argyleshire,\r\nbetween the hollow of Loch Long and the Firth of Clyde on the east\r\nand Loch Fyne on the west, has been found by my colleague, Mr. C. T.\r\nClough, to contain an extraordinary number of dykes (see Fig. 257). The\r\ncoast line of Renfrewshire and Ayrshire shows that the same feature is\r\nprolonged into the eastern side of the basin of the Clyde estuary. But\r\nimmediately to the westward of this area the crowded dykes disappear\r\nfrom the basin of Loch Fyne. In Cantire their scarcity is as remarkable\r\nas their abundance in Cowal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ xiv. (1840), p. 677.]\r\n\r\nBoth in the North of Ireland and through the Inner Hebrides, dykes\r\nare singularly abundant in and around, but particularly beneath, the\r\ngreat plateaux of basalt. Their profusion in Skye was described early\r\nin this century by Macculloch, who called attention more especially to\r\ntheir extraordinary development in the district of Strathaird. \"They\r\nnearly equal in some places,\" he says, \"when collectively measured, the\r\nstratified rock through which they pass. I have counted six or eight\r\nin the space of fifty yards, of which the collective dimensions could\r\nnot be less than sixty or seventy feet.\" He supposed that it would not\r\nbe an excessive estimate to regard the igneous rock as amounting to\r\none-tenth of the breadth of the strata which it cuts.[161] This estimate,\r\nhowever, falls much short of the truth in some parts of Strathaird,\r\nwhere the dykes are almost or quite contiguous, and the Jurassic\r\nstrata, through which they rise, are hardly to be seen at all.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: _Trans. Geol. Soc._ iii. (1815), p. 79. This locality is\r\nfurther noticed on p. 164.]\r\n\r\nAmong the districts where dykes of the gregarious type abound at a\r\ndistance from any of the basalt-plateaux, reference should be made\r\nto the curious isolated tract of the central granite core of Western\r\nDonegal. In that area a considerable number of dykes rises through\r\nthe granite, to which they are almost wholly confined. Again, far to\r\nthe east another limited district, where dykes are crowded together,\r\nlies among the Mourne Mountains. These granite hills are probably to\r\nbe classed with those of Arran, as portions of a series of granite\r\nprotrusions belonging to a late part of the Tertiary volcanic period\r\nwhich will be treated of in Chapter xlvii.\r\n\r\nThough the dykes may be conveniently grouped in two series or types,\r\nwhich on the whole are tolerably well marked, it is not always\r\npracticable to draw any line between them, or to say to which group\r\na particular dyke should be assigned. In some districts, however, in\r\nwhich they are both developed, we can separate them without difficulty.\r\nIn the Argyleshire region above referred to, for example, which\r\nMr. Clough has mapped, he finds that the abundant dykes belonging\r\nto the gregarious type run in a general N.W. or N.N.W. direction,\r\nand distinctly intersect the much scarcer and less basic dykes of\r\nthe solitary type, which here run nearly E. and W. (Fig. 257).\r\nHence, besides their composition, distinction in number, breadth,\r\nrectilinearity and persistence, the two series in that region\r\ndemonstrably belong to distinct periods of eruption.[162]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: Mr. Clough is inclined to suspect that the E. and W. dykes\r\nare older than the Tertiary series and may be later Palæozoic.]\r\n\r\nThe characteristic habit in gregarious dykes of occurring in crowded\r\ngroups which are separated from each other by intervals of variable\r\ndimensions, marked by the presence of comparatively few dykes, is well\r\nillustrated in the district of Strath in Skye, which indeed may be\r\ntaken as a typical area for this peculiarity of distribution. While the\r\ndykes are there singularly abundant in the Cambrian Limestone and the\r\nLiassic strata, they have been found by Mr. Clough and Mr. Harker to be\r\ncomparatively infrequent in the tracts of Torridon Sandstone. It is not\r\neasy to understand this peculiar arrangement. As the Torridon Sandstone\r\nis the most ancient rock of the district, it probably underlies all the\r\nCambrian and Jurassic formations, so that the dykes which penetrate\r\nthese younger strata must also rise through the Torridonian rocks.\r\nSome formations appear to have been fissured more readily than others,\r\nand thus to have provided more abundant openings for the uprise of the\r\nbasaltic magma from below. To the effect of such local differences in\r\nthe structure of the terrestrial crust we have to add the concentration\r\nof the volcanic foci in certain areas, though there seems no means\r\nof ascertaining what part each of these causes has played in the\r\ndistribution of the dykes of any particular district.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. NATURE OF COMPONENT ROCKS\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary dykes of Britain include representatives of four distinct\r\ngroups of igneous rocks. 1st, The vast majority of them consist of\r\nplagioclase-pyroxene-magnetite rocks with or without olivine. These are\r\nthe normal basalts and dolerites. 2nd, A number of large dykes have\r\na rather more acid composition and are classed as andesites. 3rd, A\r\nfew dykes of trachyte have been observed in Cowal and in Skye cutting\r\nthe dykes of basalt (p. 138). 4th, In some districts large numbers\r\nof still more acid dykes occur. These are sometimes crystalline in\r\nstructure (granophyre), more frequently felsitic (felsite, spherulitic\r\nquartz-porphyry), and often glassy (pitchstone). In some exceptional\r\ncases the basic and acid materials are conjoined in the same dyke.\r\nSuch compound varieties are described at p. 161. The acid dykes,\r\nconnected as they so generally are with the large bodies of granophyre\r\nor granite, are doubtless younger than the great majority of the basic\r\ndykes. They will be treated in connection with the acid intrusions in\r\nChapter xlviii.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater number of the dykes of the Tertiary volcanic series\r\nbelong to the first group, and it is these more especially which will\r\nbe discussed in the present and the following Chapter. As, however, the\r\nandesitic group is intimately linked with the basaltic it will be here\r\nincluded with them.\r\n\r\n1. Basalt, Dolerite and Andesite Dykes.--To the field-geologist, who\r\nregards merely their external features, the Tertiary dykes present a\r\nstriking uniformity in general petrographical character. They vary\r\nindeed in fineness or coarseness of texture, in the presence or absence\r\nof porphyritic crystals, amygdales, glassy portions and other points\r\nof structure. But there is seldom any difficulty in perceiving that\r\nthey generally belong to one or other of the types of the basalts,\r\ndolerites, diabases or andesites. This sameness of composition,\r\ntraceable from Yorkshire to Skye and from Donegal to Perthshire, is\r\none of the strongest arguments for referring this system of dykes to\r\none geological period. At the same time, there are enough of minor\r\nvariations and local peculiarities to afford abundant exercise for the\r\nobserving faculties alike in the field and in the study, and to offer\r\nmaterials for arriving at some positive conclusions regarding the\r\ngeological processes involved in the uprise of the dykes.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be reason to believe that, when the petrography of the\r\ndykes is more minutely studied, marked differences of material will be\r\nfound to denote distinct periods of eruption. Already Mr. A. Harker of\r\nthe Geological Survey, who is engaged in mapping the interesting and\r\ncomplicated district of Strath in Skye, has observed that the dykes\r\nwhich are older than the great granophyre bosses of that tract may be\r\ndistinguished from those which are later than these protrusions. The\r\nolder basic dykes are not conspicuously porphyritic, are frequently\r\nmarked by a close-grained margin or even with a veneer of basalt-glass,\r\nsometimes have an inclination of as much as 45°, are occasionally\r\ndiscontinuous, and not infrequently branch or send out veins. The\r\nyounger dykes, on the other hand, as will be more particularly noticed\r\nin the following chapter, are distinguished by the frequent and\r\nremarkable character of their porphyritic inclusions, by the presence\r\nof foreign fragments in them, by the greater perfection of their\r\njointing, and by their seldom departing much from the vertical.[163] They\r\nare likewise often markedly acid in composition, including such rocks\r\nas granophyre, felsite and pitchstone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: In the Blath Bheinn group of gabbro-hills, however, it is\r\nthe youngest dykes which have been found by Mr. Harker to possess the\r\nlowest hade.]\r\n\r\n(1) _External Characters._--As regards the grain of the rock, every\r\ngradation may be found, from a coarsely crystalline mass, in which the\r\ncomponent minerals are distinctly traceable with the naked eye, to a\r\nblack lustrous basalt-glass. Each dyke generally preserves the same\r\ncharacter throughout its extent. As a rule, broad and long dykes are\r\ncoarser in grain than narrow and short ones. For the most part, there\r\nruns along each side of a dyke a selvage of finer grain than the rest\r\nof the mass. This marginal strip varies in breadth from an inch or less\r\nup to a foot or more, and obviously owes its origin to the more rapid\r\nchilling of the molten rock along the walls of the fissure. It usually\r\nshades away inperceptibly into the larger-grained inner portion. Even\r\nwith the naked eye its component materials can be seen to be more\r\nfinely crystalline than the rest of the dyke, though where dispersed\r\nporphyritic felspars occur they are as large in the marginal strip as\r\nin any other part of a dyke, for they belong to an earlier period of\r\ncrystallization than the smaller felspars of the groundmass and were\r\nalready floating in the magma while it was still in a molten state.\r\n\r\nThis finer-grained external band, so distinctive of an eruptive and\r\ninjected rock, is of great service in enabling us to trace dykes\r\nwhen they traverse other dykes or masses of igneous rock of similar\r\ncharacters to their own. When one dyke crosses another, that which has\r\nits marginal band of finer grain unbroken must obviously be the younger\r\nof the two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 235.--Plan of basalt-veins with selvages of black\r\n  basalt-glass, east side of Beinn Tighe, Isle of Eigg.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut in many examples in the south of Scotland, Argyleshire and the\r\nInner Hebrides, the fineness of grain of the outer band culminates\r\nin a perfect volcanic glass. Where this occurs, the glass is usually\r\njet black, more rarely greenish or bluish black in tint, and varies\r\nin thickness from about a couple of inches to a mere varnish-like\r\nfilm on the outer face of the dyke, the average width being probably\r\nless than a quarter of an inch (Fig. 235). On their weathered surface\r\nthese external glassy layers generally present a pattern of rounded or\r\npolygonal prominences, varying up to four or five lines or even more in\r\ndiameter, and separated by depressions or narrow ribs. The transition\r\nfrom the glass to the crystalline part of the marginal fine-grained\r\nstrip is usually somewhat abrupt, insomuch that on weathered faces\r\nit is often difficult to get good specimens, owing to the tendency\r\nof the vitreous portion to fly off when struck with the hammer. The\r\nglass doubtless represents the original condition of the rock of the\r\ndyke. It was suddenly chilled and solidified by contact with the\r\ncold walls of the fissure. Inside this external glassy coating, the\r\nmolten material could probably still move, and had time to assume a\r\nmore or less completely crystalline condition before solidification.\r\nNot infrequently the glass shows spherulitic forms, visible to the\r\nnaked eye, and likewise a more or less distinctly developed perlitic\r\nstructure. These features, however, are best studied in thin sections\r\nof the rock with the aid of the microscope, as will be subsequently\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nIn some dykes, the glass is not confined to the edges, but runs in\r\nstrings or broader bands along the central portions, or has been\r\nsqueezed into little cavities like steam-holes or into minute fissures.\r\nOne of the most remarkable examples of this peculiarity occurs in the\r\nwell-known dyke of Eskdale, which runs for so many miles across the\r\nsouthern uplands of Scotland.[164] This dyke throughout most of its\r\ncourse is a crystalline rock of the andesitic type. At Wat Carrick,\r\nin Eskdale, it presents an arrangement into three parallel bands.\r\nOn either side, a zone about eight feet broad consists of the usual\r\ncrystalline material. Between these two marginal portions lies an\r\nintercalated mass 16 to 18 feet broad, of a very compact and more or\r\nless vitreous rock. The demarcation between this central band and the\r\nmore crystalline zones of the outside is quite sharp, and the two\r\nkinds of rock show a totally distinct system of jointing. There can,\r\ntherefore, be little doubt that the glassy centre belongs to a later\r\nuprise than the outer portions, though possibly it may still have been\r\nincluded in the long process of solidification of one original injected\r\nmass of molten material. If the marginal parts adhered firmly to the\r\nwalls, the centre, which with its band of vesicles seems often to have\r\nbeen a line of weakness, might be ruptured and subsequent intrusions\r\nwould find their way along the rent. Examples of this splitting of\r\ndykes with the intrusion of later eruptive Material will be cited in\r\nlater pages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: See _Proc. Roy. Phys. Soc. Edin._ v. (1880), p. 241.]\r\n\r\nMr. Clough, while mapping for the Geological Survey the extraordinarily\r\nnumerous dykes in the eastern part of Argyleshire between the Firth\r\nof Clyde and Upper Loch Fyne, observed six or seven examples of dykes\r\nshowing glassy bands in their centres, with characters similar to those\r\nof the Eskdale dyke. He found an absence of definite and regular joints\r\nin the central glassy band, and on the other hand, an irregular set of\r\ndivisional planes by which the rock is traversed, and which he compared\r\nto those seen in true perlitic structure.\r\n\r\nWhile, as a general rule, the external portions of a dyke are\r\ncloser-grained than the centre, rare cases occur where the middle is\r\nthe most finely crystalline part. I am disposed to regard these cases\r\nand the glassy centres as forming in reality no true exceptions to the\r\nrule, that the outer portions of a dyke consolidated first, and are\r\ntherefore finest in texture. For the most part, each dyke appears to be\r\ndue to a single uprise of molten matter, though considerable movements\r\nmay have taken place within its mass before the whole stiffened into\r\nstone. Some particulars regarding these movements will be given in\r\nsection 12 of the next Chapter. It has already been mentioned that in\r\nlarge dykes which have served as volcanic pipes, it is conceivable\r\nthat while the material next the outside consolidated and adhered to\r\nthe walls, the central portion may have remained liquid, and may even\r\nhave been propelled upward and have been succeeded by a different kind\r\nof magma, as has been suggested by Mr. Iddings. In such cases, which,\r\nif they occur, are probably excessively rare, we may expect that the\r\nearlier and later material will not be sharply marked off from each\r\nother, unless we suppose that the whole of the earlier liquid magma was\r\nso entirely ejected that only its congealed marginal selvage was left\r\nas bounding walls for the newer injection.\r\n\r\nWhere, after more or less complete consolidation had taken place,\r\nthe fissure opened again, or from any other cause the dyke was split\r\nalong its centre, any lava which rose up the rent would tend to take a\r\nfiner grain than the material of the rest of the dyke, and might even\r\nsolidify as glass.\r\n\r\nLarge scattered crystals of felspar, of an earlier consolidation than\r\nthat of the minuter forms of the same mineral in the general groundmass\r\nof the rock, give a porphyritic structure and andesitic character to\r\nmany dykes. Occasionally such crystals attain a considerable size. Mr.\r\nClough has observed them in some of the Argyleshire dykes reaching\r\na length of between three and four inches, with a thickness of two\r\ninches. Sometimes they are distributed with tolerable uniformity\r\nthrough the substance of the dyke. But not infrequently they may be\r\nobserved in more or less definite bands parallel with the boundary\r\nwalls. Unlike the younger lath-shaped and much smaller felspars of the\r\ngroundmass, they show no diminution either in size or abundance towards\r\nthe edge of the dyke. On the contrary, as already mentioned, they are\r\noften conspicuous in the close-grained marginal strip, and may be found\r\neven in the glassy selvage, or touching the very wall of the fissure.\r\nIndeed, they are sometimes more abundant in the outer than in the\r\ninner portions of a dyke, having travelled outwards to the surfaces of\r\nearliest cooling and crystallization.\r\n\r\nMr. Clough has given me the details of an interesting case of this kind\r\nobserved by him in Glen Tarsan, Eastern Argyleshire:--\"For an inch\r\nor so from the edge of this dyke,\" he remarks, \"porphyritic felspars\r\ngiving squarish sections, and ranging up to one-third of an inch in\r\nlength, are so abundant as nearly to equal in bulk the surrounding\r\ngroundmass. For the next inch and a half, they are decidedly fewer,\r\noccupying perhaps hardly an eighth of the area exposed. Then for a\r\nbreadth of three inches they come in again nearly as abundantly as at\r\nthe sides; after which they diminish through a band 27 inches broad,\r\nwhere they may form from 1/8 to 1/12 of the rock.\" He found another\r\ncase where, in a dyke several yards wide, porphyritic felspars,\r\nsometimes an inch long, are common along the eastern margin of the\r\ndyke in a band about two inches broad, but nearly absent from the rest\r\nof the rock. Elsewhere the crystals are grouped rather in patches than\r\nin bands. Among the dykes south of Oban some similar instances of\r\ncoarsely porphyritic felspars may be observed.\r\n\r\nNot only are these porphyritic felspars apt to occur in bands parallel\r\nwith the outer margins of the dykes, but they tend to range themselves\r\nwith their longer axis in the same direction, thus even on a large\r\nscale, visible at some distance, showing the flow-structure, which is\r\nso often erroneously regarded as essentially a microscopic arrangement,\r\nand as specially characteristic of superficial lava-streams.\r\n\r\nMr. Harker in his survey of Strath, Skye, has met with some remarkable\r\nexamples of the enclosure and incorporation of foreign materials\r\nin the younger group of dykes which in that district traverse the\r\ngranophyres and gabbros. He remarks that the great majority of these\r\ndykes are basic, and he has found them to be capable of convenient\r\ndivision into two groups. 1st, Non-porphyritic basic dykes with a\r\nspecific gravity between 2·87 and 2·97, and an amygdaloidal structure\r\naffording clear indication of flowing movement, either at the sides or\r\nalong a central band. These dykes do not greatly differ from those of\r\npre-granophyre eruption. 2nd, Porphyritic basic dykes which present\r\nfeatures of peculiar interest. The porphyritic (or pseudo-porphyritic)\r\nelements, according to Mr. Harker's observations, are constantly\r\nfelspar, frequently subordinate augite, and exceptionally quartz. The\r\nfelspars have for the most part rounded outlines with a bordering\r\nzone of glass cavities apparently of secondary origin. The augite, in\r\nrounded composite crystal-grains, differs from that of the groundmass\r\nand resembles the augite of the gabbros. The quartz-grains are likewise\r\nrounded, and show sometimes a distinct corroded border.\r\n\r\nThese characters, Mr. Harker observes, are those of crystals derived\r\nfrom some foreign source, and it can scarcely be doubted that this\r\nis the explanation of their presence. He noticed that the dykes in\r\nquestion frequently enclose fragments, varying up to several inches in\r\ndiameter, of gabbro, granite or granophyre, bedded lava, quartzite,\r\netc., which show clear evidence of having been rounded and corroded\r\nby an enveloping magma, and recognizable crystals from some of the\r\nfragments may be observed in the surrounding parts of the matrix\r\nof the dykes. Most of the felspar and augite crystals disseminated\r\nthrough these porphyritic basic dykes may be referred to the partial\r\nreabsorption of enclosed fragments of gabbro. The same observer has\r\nfound that many of the dykes which rise through the basalt-plateau of\r\nStrathaird are crowded with gabbro fragments.\r\n\r\nAnother megascopic character of the material composing the dykes is the\r\nfrequent presence of amygdales. It has sometimes been supposed that\r\namygdaloidal structure may be relied upon as a test to distinguish\r\na mass of molten rock which has reached the surface from one which\r\nhas consolidated under considerable pressure below ground. That this\r\nsupposition, however, is erroneous is demonstrated by hundreds of dykes\r\nin the great system which I am now describing. But the amygdales of a\r\ndyke offer certain peculiarities which serve in a general way to mark\r\nthem off from those of an outflowing lava. They are usually smaller\r\nand more uniform in size than in the latter rock. They are also more\r\nregularly spherical and less frequently elongated in the direction of\r\nflow. Moreover, they are not usually distributed through the whole\r\nbreadth of a dyke, but tend to arrange themselves in lines especially\r\ntowards its centre (Fig. 236). In these central bands the cavities are\r\nlargest and depart farthest from the regular spherical form, so that\r\nfor short spaces they may equal in bulk the mass of enclosing rock.\r\nIn some rare instances, a whole dyke is composed of cellular basalt,\r\nlike one of the lava-sheets in the plateaux, as may be seen on the\r\nnorth flank of Beinn Suardal, Skye. Mr. Harker has observed that an\r\namygdaloidal structure is more common among the earlier than among the\r\nlater dykes of that district.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 236.--Arrangement of lines of amygdales in a dyke,\r\nStrathmore, Skye.]\r\n\r\nBesides the common arrangement of fine-grained edges and a more\r\ncoarsely crystalline centre, instances are found where one of the\r\ncontrasted portions of a dyke traverses the other in the form of veins.\r\nOf these, I think, there are two distinct kinds, probably originating\r\nin entirely different conditions. In the first place, they may be of\r\ncoarser grain than the rest of the rock; but such a structure appears\r\nto be of extremely rare occurrence. I have noticed some examples on the\r\ncoast of Renfrewshire, where strings of a more coarsely crystalline\r\ntexture traverse the finer-grained body of the rock. Veins of this kind\r\nare probably of the same nature as the so-called \"segregation-veins,\"\r\nto be afterwards referred to as of frequent occurrence among the\r\nthicker Tertiary sills. They consist of the same minerals as the\r\nrest of the rock, but in a different and more developed crystalline\r\narrangement, and they contain no glassy or devitrified material, except\r\nsuch portions of that of the surrounding groundmass as may have been\r\ncaught between their crystalline constituents.\r\n\r\nThe second kind of veins, which, though not common, is of much more\r\nfrequent occurrence than the first, is more particularly to be met with\r\namong the broader dykes, and is distinguished by a remarkable fineness\r\nof grain, sometimes approaching the texture of felsite or jasper, and\r\noccasionally taking the form of actual glass. Such veins vary from\r\nhalf an inch or less, up to four or five inches in breadth. They run\r\nsometimes parallel with the walls of the dyke, but often irregularly\r\nin all directions, and for the most part avoid the marginal portions,\r\nthough now and then coming up to the edge. They never extend beyond\r\nthe body of the dyke itself into the surrounding rock. Though they\r\nhave obviously been injected after the solidification of the rock\r\nwhich they traverse, they may quite possibly be extrusions of a deeper\r\nunconsolidated portion of the same rock into rents of the already\r\nstiffened overlying parts. The field-geologist cannot fail to be struck\r\nwith the much greater hardness of these fine-grained veins and strings\r\nthat ramify through the coarsely crystalline dolerite, andesite or\r\nother variety of the broader dykes. He can readily perceive in many\r\ncases their more siliceous composition, and the inferences he deduces\r\nfrom the rough observations he can make in the field are confirmed by\r\nthe results of chemical analysis (see p. 137).\r\n\r\nIn connection with veins of finer material, that may belong to a late\r\nstage of the consolidation of the general body of a dyke, reference may\r\nbe made here to the occasional occurrence of patches of an exceedingly\r\ncompact or homogeneous texture immersed in the usual finely crystalline\r\nmarginal material. They look like angular and subangular portions of\r\nthe more rapidly cooled outer edge, which have been broken off and\r\ncarried upward by the still moving mass in the fissure.[165]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: See Mr. J. J. H. Teall, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xl.\r\n(1884), p. 214.]\r\n\r\nIn general, each dyke is composed of one kind of rock, and retains\r\nits chemical and mineralogical characters with singular persistence.\r\nThe difference of texture between the fine-grained chilled margin,\r\nwith its occasional glassy coating, and the more coarsely crystalline\r\ncentre is due to cooling and crystalline segregation in what was no\r\ndoubt originally one tolerably uniform molten mass. The glassy central\r\nbands, too, though they indicate a rupture of the dyke up the middle,\r\nmay at the same time quite conceivably be, as I have said, extrusions\r\nfrom a lower portion of the dyke before the final solidification of the\r\nwhole. The ramifying veins of finer grain that now and then traverse\r\none of the large dykes are likewise explicable as parts of a stage\r\ntowards entire consolidation. All these vitreous portions, whether\r\nstill remaining as glass or having undergone devitrification, are\r\nmore acid than the surrounding crystalline parts of the rock. They\r\nrepresent the siliceous \"mother-liquor,\" so to speak, which was left\r\nafter the separation from it of the crystallized minerals, and which,\r\nperhaps, entangled here and there in vesicles of the slowly cooling\r\nand consolidating rock, was ready to be forced up into cracks of the\r\noverlying mass during any renewal of terrestrial disturbance.\r\n\r\nBut examples occur where a dyke, instead of consisting of one rock, is\r\nmade up of two or more bands of rock which, even if they resemble each\r\nother closely, can be shown to be the results of separate eruptions.\r\nThese, which are obviously not exceptions to the general rule of the\r\nhomogeneity of dykes, I will consider in the next Chapter.\r\n\r\nAmong the petrographical varieties observable in the field is the\r\noccasional envelopment of portions of the surrounding rocks in the\r\nbody of a dyke. Angular fragments torn off from the fissure-walls\r\nhave been carried upwards in the ascending lava, and now appear more\r\nor less metamorphosed, the amount of alteration seeming to depend\r\nchiefly upon the susceptibility of the enclosed rock to change from\r\nthe effects of heat. Cases of such entanglement, however, are of less\r\ncommon occurrence than those already referred to, where pieces of some\r\ndeep-seated rock, such as the gabbros of Skye, have been carried up in\r\nthe ascending magma. Occasionally, where the enclosed fragments are\r\noblong, they are arranged with their longer axes parallel to the walls\r\nof the dyke, showing flow-structure on a large scale. Mr. Clough has\r\nfound some dykes near Dunoon which enclose fragments of schist nearly\r\nthree feet in length.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of the megascopic features of the dykes is\r\nthe joints by which they are traversed. These divisional planes are no\r\ndoubt to be regarded as consequences of the contraction of the original\r\nmolten rock during cooling and consolidation between its fissure-walls.\r\nThey are of considerable interest and importance, inasmuch as they\r\nfurnish a ready means of tracing a dyke when it runs through rock of\r\nthe same nature as itself, and also help to throw some light on the\r\nstages in the consolidation of the material of the dyke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 237.--Systems of joints in the dykes.\r\n\r\n_a_, parallel; _b_, transverse.]\r\n\r\nTwo distinct systems of joints are recognizable (Fig 237). Though\r\nsometimes combined in the same dyke, they are most conspicuously\r\ndisplayed when each occurs, as it generally does, by itself. The first\r\nand less frequent system of joints (_a_) has been determined by lines\r\nof retreat, which are parallel to the walls of the dyke. The joints\r\nare then closest together at the margin, and may be few or altogether\r\nabsent in the centre. They are sometimes so numerous, parallel and\r\ndefined towards the borders of the dyke, as to split the rock up into\r\nthin flags. Where transverse joints are also present these flags are\r\ndivided into irregular _tesseræ_.\r\n\r\nIn the second or transverse system of joints (_b_), which is the more\r\nusual, the divisional lines pass across the breadth of the dyke,\r\neither completely from side to side, or from one wall for a longer or\r\nshorter distance towards the other. Where this series of joints is\r\nmost completely developed the dyke appears to be built up of prisms\r\npiled horizontally, or nearly so, one above another. These prisms, in\r\nrare instances, are as regular as the columns of a basalt-sheet (see\r\nFig. 166). Usually, however, they have irregularly defined faces, and\r\nmerge into each other. Where the prismatic structure is not displayed,\r\nthe joints, starting sharply at the wall of the dyke, strike inwards\r\nin irregular curving lines. It is such transverse joints that enable\r\nthe eye, even from a distance, to distinguish readily the course of\r\na dyke up the face of a cliff of basalt-beds, for they belong to the\r\ndyke itself, are often at right angles to those of the adjacent basalt,\r\nand by their alternate projecting and re-entering angles seam the dyke\r\nwith parallel bars of light and shade (see the double dyke in Fig.\r\n333). Where they traverse not only the general mass of a dyke, but\r\nalso the \"contemporaneous veins\" which cross it, it may be inferred\r\nthat these veins were injected before the final solidification and\r\ncontraction of the whole dyke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 238.--Section of cylindrical vein or dyke, cutting the bedded\r\n  lavas, east side of Fuglö, Faroe Islands.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAn interesting modification of the transverse joints may sometimes be\r\nobserved, where, as in the case of the Palæozoic \"Rock and Spindle,\"\r\nat St. Andrews (Fig. 222), the molten material has solidified in a\r\ntubular or spherical cavity. The joints then radiate inwards from the\r\nouter curved surface. The most remarkable instance of this structure\r\nwhich I have found among the Tertiary volcanic plateaux occurs on the\r\neast side of the island Fuglö, the most north-easterly of the group of\r\nthe Faroes. It is cut in section by the face of the precipice, where\r\nit appears as a round mass about 40 or 50 feet in diameter piercing\r\nthe plateau-basalts. A selvage of finer material round its outer edge\r\nshows the effect of rapid chilling, while the joints diverge from the\r\nperiphery and extend in fan-shape towards the centre (Fig. 238).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 239.--Joint-structures in the central vitreous\r\nportion of the Eskdale Dyke (B. N. Peach).\r\n\r\n  A, View of a square yard of the outer wall of the vitreous central\r\n  band, showing the polygonal arrangement of the prisms and their\r\n  investing sheath of ribs.\r\n\r\n  B, View of a smaller portion of the same wall to show the detailed\r\n  structure of the ribs (_a_ _a_) and their vitreous cores (_b_ _b_).\r\n\r\n  C, Profile of a part of the weathered face of the wall, showing the\r\n  way in which the hard ribs or sheaths project at the surface.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable exhibitions of joint-structure hitherto\r\nnoticed among the Tertiary dykes is that which occurs in the central\r\nvitreous band of the Eskdale dyke already referred to. The rock is\r\ndivided into nearly horizontal prisms, each of which consists of an\r\ninner more vitreous core and an outer more lithoid sheath. By the\r\ncoherence of their polygonal and irregular faces, and the greater\r\ndurability of their material, these sheaths project on the weathered\r\nwall of the vitreous centre of the dyke in a curiously reticulated\r\ngrouping of prominent ribs each about two inches broad (Fig. 239, A),\r\nwhile the vitreous cores, being more readily acted on by the weather,\r\nare hollowed out into little cup-shaped depressions. Each rib is thus\r\ncomposed of the sheaths or outer lithoid portions of two prisms, the\r\nline of separation being marked by a suture along the centre (B).\r\nBetween this median suture and the inner glassy core the rib is further\r\ncut into small segments by a set of close joints, which are placed\r\ngenerally at right angles to the course of the rib (C). Examined with a\r\nlens, the lithoid substance of these sheaths has a dull finely granular\r\naspect, like that of felsitic rocks, with scattered felspars. It is\r\nobviously a more devitrified condition of the material which forms\r\nthe core of each prism. This material presents on a fresh fracture a\r\ndeep iron-black colour, dull resinous lustre and vitreous texture.\r\nIt at once recalls the aspect of many acid pitchstones, and in the\r\nearly days of petrography was naturally mistaken for one of these\r\nrocks. Through its substance numerous kernels of more glassy lustre\r\nare dispersed, each of which usually contains one or more amygdales\r\nof dull white chalcedony, but sometimes only an empty black cavity.\r\nThese black glistening kernels of glass, of all sizes up to that of a\r\nsmall bean, scattered through the dull resinous matrix, form with the\r\nwhite amygdales the most prominent feature in the cores; but crystals\r\nof felspars may also be observed. Some details of the microscopic\r\ncharacters of this remarkable structure will be given in a subsequent\r\npage. The relation of the cores and sheaths to the prismatic jointing\r\nof the rock seems to show that devitrification had not been completed\r\nwhen these joints were established, and that it proceeded from the\r\nfaces of each prism inwards.\r\n\r\n(2) _Microscopic Characters._--Much information has now been obtained\r\nregarding the microscopic structure of the basaltic, doleritic and\r\nandesitic dykes. The crystalline characters of those in the North of\r\nEngland have been studied by Mr. Teall,[166] and some of those from\r\nthe West of Scotland have been investigated by Professors Judd and\r\nCole.[167] Taken as a whole, the rocks composing the dykes are found,\r\nwhen examined microscopically, to consist essentially of mixtures of a\r\nplagioclase felspar, pyroxene and iron oxide, with or without olivine,\r\nand usually with more or less interstitial matter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 166: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xl. (1884).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 167: _Op. cit._ vol. xxxix. (1883) p. 444 (basalt-glass); xlii.\r\n(1886) p. 49, where Professor Judd discusses the gabbros, dolerites and\r\nbasalts as a whole.]\r\n\r\nThe felspar appears to be in some cases labradorite, in others\r\nanorthite, but there may be a mingling of several species in many\r\nof the dykes, as in the augite-andesite of the Santorin eruption in\r\n1866, wherein Professor Fouqué found that the larger porphyritic\r\nfelspars were mainly labradorite, but partly anorthite, while those\r\nof the groundmass were microlites of albite and oligoclase.[168] The\r\nlarge felspars scattered porphyritically through the groundmass\r\nare evidently the result of an early consolidation, unless where\r\nthey are survivals from fragments of older porphyritic rocks which\r\nhave been enveloped and partially dissolved in the dykes. They are\r\noften cracked, penetrated by the groundmass, or even broken into\r\nfragments, and have corroded borders. They sometimes include portions\r\nof the groundmass, and present the zonal growth structure in great\r\nperfection. The small felspars of the groundmass, on the other hand,\r\nare as obviously the result of a later crystallization, for they vary\r\nin size and crystallographic development according to their position\r\nin the dyke. Those from the centre are often in well-formed crystals,\r\nwhich sometimes pass round their borders into acicular microlites.\r\nThose in the marginal parts of the dyke occur chiefly in the form\r\nof these microlites, forming the felted aggregate so characteristic\r\nof the andesites. Curious skeleton forms, composed of aggregates of\r\nmicrolites, connect the latter with the more completely developed\r\ncrystals, and illustrate the mode of crystallization of the felspathic\r\nconstituents of the dykes.[169]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: _Santorin et ses Éruptions_, 1879, p. 203.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: See Mr. Teall's excellent description of the Cleveland\r\ndyke, in the paper above cited.]\r\n\r\nThe pyroxene is probably in most cases monoclinic (black or common\r\naugite), but is sometimes rhombic (usually enstatite, less frequently\r\nperhaps hypersthene). It occurs in (_a_) well-developed crystals,\r\n(_b_) crystalline masses with some of the faces of the crystals\r\ndeveloped, (_c_) granular aggregates which polarise in one plane, (_d_)\r\nseparate granules and microscopic microlites, which may be spherical\r\n(globulites) or oblong (longulites).\r\n\r\nThe black iron-oxide is sometimes magnetite, sometimes ilmenite, or\r\nother titaniferous ore. Apatite not infrequently occurs among the\r\noriginal constituents. Olivine is entirely absent from most of the\r\nlarge solitary dykes, especially at a distance from the great volcanic\r\ncentres, and no serpentinous matter remains to indicate that it was\r\never present in them. But it is to be met with in numerous basalt-dykes\r\nin the volcanic areas, either in sparsely scattered or in tolerably\r\nabundant crystals. Biotite occasionally appears. Among the secondary\r\nproducts, calcite and pyrites are doubtless the most common. To these\r\nmust be added quartz, chalcedony and various zeolitic substances,\r\nbesides the aggregates which result from the decomposition of the\r\nferro-magnesian constituents and the oxidation of the ferrous oxides.\r\n\r\nIn many dykes there is little or no interstitial matter between the\r\ncrystalline constituents of the groundmass. In others this matter\r\namounts to a half or more of the whole composition, and from such cases\r\na series of gradations may be traced into a complete glass containing\r\nonly the rudimentary forms of crystals (globulites, longulites, etc.),\r\nwith scattered porphyritic crystals of an earlier consolidation. The\r\nprocess of the disappearance of this original glass may be admirably\r\nstudied in many dykes. At the outer wall, the glass remains nearly\r\nas it was when contact with the cold walls of the fissure solidified\r\nit. From that external vitreous layer the successive devitrification\r\nproducts and crystalline growths may be followed inwards until in the\r\ncentral parts of a broad dyke little or no trace of the interstitial\r\nmatter may be left.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 240.--Microscopic structure of the vitreous part of\r\nthe Eskdale Dyke.\r\n\r\n  This section shows a crystal of augite, enclosing magnetite and\r\n  surrounded with microlites, each of which consists of a central\r\n  pale yellow rod crusted with pale yellow isotropic globulites. The\r\n  glass around this aggregation is clear, but at a little distance\r\n  globulites (many of them elongated and dichotomous) abound, with\r\n  here and there scattered microlites, some of which are curved and\r\n  spiral. (800 diameters.)[170]\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 170: _Proc. Roy. Phys. Soc. Edin._ v. (1880), p. 255.]\r\n\r\nThe most instructive example of the process of devitrification which\r\nhas come under my observation occurs in the Eskdale dyke. The central\r\n\"cores\" already referred to present a true glass, which in thin\r\nsections is perfectly transparent and almost colourless, but by streaks\r\nand curving lines of darker tint shows beautiful flow-structure. The\r\ndevitrification of this glass has been accomplished by the development\r\nof crystallites and crystals, which increase in number until all\r\nthe vitreous part of the rock disappears. What seems under a low\r\npower to be a structureless or slightly dusty glass can be resolved\r\nwith a higher objective into an aggregate of minute globules or\r\ngranules (globulites), which average perhaps 1/20,000 of an inch in\r\ndiameter. Some of these bodies are elongated and even dichotomous at\r\nthe ends. These granules are especially crowded upon clear yellow\r\ndart-shaped rods, which in turn are especially prominent upon crystals\r\nand crystalline grains of augite that bristle with them, while the\r\nimmediately surrounding glass has become clear. There can be little\r\ndoubt that these rudimentary bodies are stages in the arrested\r\ndevelopment of augite crystals. There occur also opaque grains, rods\r\nand trichites, which no doubt consist in whole of magnetite (or other\r\niron oxide), or are crusted over with that mineral.\r\n\r\nAt least two broad types of microscopic structure may be recognized\r\namong the basic and intermediate dykes. (1) Holocrystalline, or with\r\nonly a trifling proportion of interstitial matter. This type includes\r\nthe dolerites and basalts, as well as rocks which German petrographers\r\nwould class as diabases or diabase-porphyrites. The rocks are very\r\ngenerally characterized by ophitic structure, where the lath-shaped\r\nfelspars penetrate the augite, and are therefore of an earlier\r\nconsolidation. In such cases there is a general absence of any true\r\ninterstitial matter. The rocks of this type are often rich in olivine,\r\nand appear to be on the whole considerably more basic than those of\r\nthe second group. It is observable that they increase in numbers from\r\nthe centre of Scotland westwards, and throughout the region of the\r\nbasalt-plateaux they form the prevailing type. (2) In this type there\r\nis a marked proportion of interstitial substance, which is inserted in\r\nwedge-shaped portions among the crystallised constituents (\"intersertal\r\nstructure\" of Rosenbusch). The ophitic structure appears to be absent,\r\nand olivine is either extremely rare or does not occur at all. The\r\nrocks of this group are obviously less basic than those of the other.\r\nThey form the large dykes that rise so conspicuously through the South\r\nof Scotland and North of England, and their general characters are well\r\ndescribed by Mr. Teall in the paper already cited. In some instances\r\nthey enclose abundant porphyritic felspars of earlier consolidation,\r\nand then present most of the characters of andesites. Professor\r\nRosenbusch has extended the name of \"Tholeiites\" to rocks of this group\r\nin the North of England.[171] The vitreous condition is found in both\r\ntypes, but is perhaps more frequent in the second. The glass of the\r\nbasalts, however, even in thin slices, is characteristically opaque\r\nfrom its crowded inclusions; while that of the andesitic forms, though\r\nblack in hand specimens, appears perfectly transparent and sometimes\r\neven colourless in thin slices.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: _Mikroskopische Physiographie_, 3rd edit. 1071 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n(3) _Chemical Characters._--The only one of these to which reference\r\nwill be made here is the varying proportion of silica. While the dykes\r\nas a whole are either intermediate or basic, some of them contain so\r\nhigh a percentage of silica as to link them with the acid rocks. The\r\naverage proportions of this ingredient range from less than 50 to\r\nnearly 60 per cent. The rocks with the lower percentage of acid are\r\nricher in the heavy bases, and have a specific gravity which sometimes\r\nrises above 3·0. They include the true dolerites and basalts. Those,\r\non the other hand, with the higher ratio of silica, are poorer in\r\nthe heavy bases, and have a specific gravity from 2·76 to 2·96. They\r\ncomprise the tholeiites, andesites and other more coarsely crystalline\r\nrocks of the great eastern and south-eastern dykes.[172]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: For analyses of dykes, see Sir I. L. Bell, _Proc. Roy.\r\nSoc._ xxiii. p. 546; Mr. J. S. Grant Wilson, _Proc. Roy. Phys. Soc.\r\nEdin._ v. p. 253; Mr. Teall, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xl. p. 209;\r\nProfessors Judd and Cole, _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ xxxix. p. 444.]\r\n\r\nNot only do the dykes differ considerably from each other in their\r\nrelative proportions of silica, but even the same dyke may sometimes be\r\nfound to present a similar diversity in different parts of its mass. It\r\nhas long been a familiar fact that the glassy parts of such rocks are\r\nmore acid than the surrounding crystalline portions. The original magma\r\nmay be regarded as a natural glass or fused silicate, in which all the\r\nelements of the rock were dissolved, and which necessarily became more\r\nacid as the various basic minerals crystallised out of it.[173] In the\r\nEskdale dyke the silica percentage of this glassy portion is 58·67,\r\nthat of the little kernels of black glass dispersed through the rock\r\nas much as 65·49.[174] In the Dunoon dyke observed by Mr. Clough the\r\nsiliceous finer-grained veins contain no less than 68·05 per cent of\r\nsilica, while the mass of the dyke itself shows on analysis only 47·36\r\nper cent.[175] Similar red strings have been noticed by the same careful\r\nobserver in an east and west dyke near Lochgoilhead. From Mr. Teall's\r\nexamination a large part of the felspar in these veins is probably\r\northoclase. It forms a much larger percentage of the entire rock than\r\nthe felspar does in normal dolerites.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: On this subject see a paper by Dr. A. Lagorio, \"Über die\r\nNatur der Glasbasis sowie der Krystallisationsvorgänge im eruptiven\r\nMagma,\" Tschermak's _Mineralog. Mittheil._ viii. (1887), p. 421.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: Mr. J. S.

Trachyte Dykes.--In the Cowal District of Argyleshire, and in\r\nthe south of Skye, Mr. Clough has encountered a limited number\r\nof dykes of trachyte. On a hasty inspection these are not always\r\nreadily distinguished from the basalt-dykes with which they agree in\r\ngeneral external aspect and in direction. Where their relation to\r\nthese dykes, however, can be determined they are found to traverse\r\nthem, and thus to be on the whole later, though one case has been\r\nobserved where a trachytic dyke is in turn traversed by one of the\r\nbasic series. Mr. Clough has supplied me with the following notes\r\nof his observations regarding the trachytic dykes. They are all\r\ncharacterized by the possession of spherulitic structures near their\r\nmargins. These features, easily perceptible to the naked eye, afford\r\nthe readiest means of distinguishing the dykes of this group. So\r\nabundant are the spherulites that they not infrequently impinge on\r\neach other in long parallel rows forming rod-like aggregates. Thus\r\nin a dyke near Craigendavie, at the head of Loch Striven, numerous\r\nplanes about a quarter of an inch apart, and composed of such close-set\r\nrods, may be observed running parallel to the marginal wall for a\r\ndistance of several inches from the edge. Most of these planes show\r\non their surfaces that the rods are always parallel to each other,\r\nbut may run in different directions in the different layers, being\r\nsometimes horizontal, sometimes vertical, or at any angle between. On\r\nexamination, each rod is found to be made up of polygonal bodies, the\r\nangles of which are quite sharp, but with their sides often slightly\r\ncurved, as if they had assumed their forms from the mutual pressure of\r\noriginal spherical bulbs. Further scrutiny shows that the polygonal\r\nbodies often exhibit an internal radiate structure.\r\n\r\nIn the central parts of the dyke the spherulitic arrangement is not\r\ntraceable. About a foot from the margin it begins to be recognizable.\r\nAt a distance of three or four inches the spherulites are about the\r\nsize of peas, and gradually diminish towards the edge until they can no\r\nlonger be seen.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic of the trachyte dykes has been found by\r\nMr. Clough to be a useful guide in discriminating them from the\r\nbasalt-group. While the amygdales in the latter are generally rudely\r\nspherical, those in the trachytes are commonly elongated in the\r\ndirection of the length of the dyke, and are frequently three quarters\r\nof an inch, sometimes even an inch and a half, in length, though less\r\nthan a quarter of an inch in breadth.\r\n\r\nA good example of these trachytic dykes, which occurs at Dunans,\r\nabout the head of Glendaruel, has been examined microscopically and\r\nchemically. The central better crystallised portion was found by\r\nMr. Teall to be composed mainly of small lath-shaped crystals of\r\northoclase, together with scales of brown biotite, a few prismatic\r\ncrystals of pale somewhat altered pyroxene and scattered granules of\r\nmagnetite. The chemical analysis of this rock by Mr. J. H. Player gave\r\nthe following composition:--\r\n\r\n  Silica            56·4\r\n  Alumina           19·0\r\n  Ferric oxide       3·5\r\n  Ferrous oxide      4·8\r\n  Lime               2·6\r\n  Magnesia           1·5\r\n  Soda               4·5\r\n  Potash             5·0\r\n  Loss on ignition   2·6\r\n                    ----\r\n                    99·9\r\n                    ====\r\n\r\n\r\n4. HADE\r\n\r\nIn the majority of cases, especially among the great single dykes,\r\nthe intrusive rock has assumed a position nearly or quite vertical.\r\nBut occasionally, where one of these solitary examples crosses a deep\r\nvalley, a slight hade is perceptible by the deviation of the line of\r\nthe dyke from its normal course. Sedgwick long ago noticed that the\r\nCleveland dyke has, in places, an inclination of at least 80° to its\r\nN.E. side.[176] In the coal-workings, also, a trifling deviation from\r\nthe vertical is sometimes perceptible, especially where a dyke has\r\nfound its way along a previously existing line of fault, as in several\r\nexamples in Stirlingshire. But in those districts where the dykes are\r\ngregarious, departures from the vertical position are not infrequent,\r\nmore particularly near the great basalt-plateaux. It was noticed by\r\nNecker, that even in such a dyke-filled region as Arran, almost all of\r\nthe dykes are vertical, though sometimes deviating from that position\r\nto the extent of 20°.[177] Berger found that the angle of deviation\r\namong those of the north of Ireland ranges from 9° to 20°, with a mean\r\nof 13°.[178] The most oblique examples are probably those which occur\r\nin the basalt-plateaux of the Inner Hebrides, where the same dyke in\r\nsome parts of its course runs horizontally between two beds, across\r\nwhich it also descends vertically (see Figs. 251, 252, 374). But with\r\nthese minor exceptions, the verticality of the great system of dykes,\r\npointing to the perpendicular fissure-walls between which the molten\r\nrock ascended, is one of the most notable features in their geological\r\nstructure. In the Strath district of Skye Mr. Harker has noticed that\r\nwhile the earlier dykes have sometimes a hade of 45°, those younger\r\nthan the granophyre are generally vertical or nearly so. In the Blath\r\nBheinn group of hills, however, as already alluded to, he has observed\r\nthat it is the youngest dykes which are inclined in a north-westerly\r\ndirection, with a hade of as much as 40° from the horizon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: _Cambridge Phil. Trans._ ii. p. 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ xiv. p. 677.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: _Trans. Geol. Soc._ iii. p. 227.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. BREADTH\r\n\r\nAn obvious characteristic of most dykes is the apparent uniformity of\r\ntheir breadth. Many of them, as exposed along shore-sections, vary as\r\nlittle in dimensions as well-built walls of masonry do. Departures\r\nfrom such uniformity may often indeed be noted, whether a dyke is\r\nfollowed laterally or vertically. The largest amount of variation is,\r\nof course, to be found among the dykes of the gregarious type, the\r\nthinner examples of which may diminish to a width of only one inch or\r\nless, while their average breadth is much smaller than in the case\r\nof the great solitary dykes. In the district of Strathaird, in Skye,\r\nMacculloch estimated that the remarkably abundant dykes there developed\r\nvary from 5 to 20 feet in breadth, but with an average breadth of not\r\nmore than 10 feet.[179] In the isle of Arran, according to Necker's\r\ncareful measurements, most of the dykes range from 2 or 3 to 10 or 15\r\nfeet, but some diminish to a few inches, while others reach a width of\r\n20, 30, or even 50 feet.[180] In the North of Ireland, Berger observed\r\nthat the average breadth of thirty-eight dykes traversing primitive\r\nrocks (schist, granites, etc.) was 9 feet; and of twenty-four in\r\nSecondary rocks, 24 feet.[181]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: _Trans. Geol. Soc._ iii. p. 80.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ xiv. p. 690 et seq.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: _Trans. Geol. Soc._ iii. p. 226. He believed that dykes\r\nin Secondary rocks reach a much greater thickness than in other\r\nformations. My own observations do not confirm this generalisation.]\r\n\r\nBut when we pass to the great solitary dykes, that run so far and so\r\ncontinuously across the country, we encounter much thicker masses of\r\nigneous rock. Most of the measurements of these dykes have been made\r\nat the surface, and the variations noted in their breadth occur along\r\ntheir horizontal extension. The Cleveland dyke, which is the longest\r\nin Britain, varies from 15 feet to more than 100 feet, with perhaps an\r\naverage width of between 70 and 90 feet.[182] Some of the great dykes\r\nthat cross Scotland are of larger dimensions. Most of them, however,\r\nlike that of Cleveland, are liable to considerable variations in\r\nbreadth when followed along their length. The dyke which runs from\r\nthe eastern coast across the Cheviot Hills and Teviotdale to the head\r\nof the Ale Water, is in some places only 10 feet broad, but at its\r\nwidest parts is probably about 100 feet. The Eskdale and Moffat dyke\r\nis in parts of its course 180 feet wide, but elsewhere it diminishes\r\nto not more than 40 feet. These variations are repeated at irregular\r\nintervals, so that the dyke alternately widens and contracts as its\r\ncourse is traced across the hills. Some of the dykes further to the\r\nnorth and west attain yet more gigantic proportions. That which crosses\r\nCantyre opposite Ardlamont Point has been measured by Mr. J. B. Hill,\r\nof the Geological Survey, who finds it to be from 150 to 180 feet broad\r\non the shore of Loch Fyne, and to swell out beyond the west side of\r\nLoch Tarbert to a breadth of 240 to 270 feet. A dyke near Strathmiglo,\r\nin Fife, is about 400 feet wide. The broadest dyke known to me is one\r\nwhich I traced near Beith, in Ayrshire, traversing the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone. Its maximum width is 640 feet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: At Cockfield, where it has long been quarried, it varies\r\nfrom 15 to 66 feet; at Armathwatie, in the vale of the Eden, it is\r\nabout 54 feet (Mr. Teall, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xl. p. 211).]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it is much less easy to get evidence of the width of\r\ndykes at different levels in their vertical extension. Yet this is\r\nobviously an important point in the theoretical discussion of their\r\norigin. Two means are available of obtaining information on the\r\nsubject--(_a_) from mining operations, and (_b_) from observations at\r\nprecipices and between hill-crests and valley-bottoms.\r\n\r\n(_a_) In the Central Scottish coal-field and in that of Ayrshire,\r\nsome large dykes have been cut through at depths of two or three\r\nhundred feet beneath the surface. But there does not appear to be any\r\nwell-ascertained variation between their width so far below ground and\r\nat the surface. In not a few cases, indeed, dykes are met with in the\r\nlower workings of the coal-pits which do not reach the surface or even\r\nthe workings in the higher coals. Such upward terminations of dykes\r\nwill be afterwards considered, and it will be shown that towards its\r\nupper limit a dyke may rapidly diminish in width.\r\n\r\n(_b_) More definite information, and often from a wider vertical range,\r\nis to be gathered on coast-cliffs and in hilly districts, where the\r\nsame dyke can be followed through a vertical range of many hundred\r\nfeet. But so far as my own observations go, no general rule can be\r\nestablished that dykes sensibly vary in width as they are traced\r\nupward. Every one who has visited the basalt-precipices of Antrim or\r\nthe Inner Hebrides, where dykes are so numerous, will remember how\r\nuniform is their breadth as they run like ribbons up the faces of the\r\nescarpments.[183] Now and then one of them may be observed to die out,\r\nbut in such cases (which are far from common) the normal width is\r\nusually maintained up to within a few feet of the termination.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: This point did not escape the attention of that excellent\r\nobserver, Berger, in his examination of the dykes in the North of\r\nIreland. We find him expressing himself thus:--\"The depth to which the\r\ndykes descend is unknown; and after having observed the sections of a\r\ngreat many along the coast in cliffs from 50 to 400 feet in height, I\r\nhave not been able to ascertain (except in one or two cases) that their\r\nsides converge or have a wedgeform tendency\" (_Trans. Geol. Soc._ iii.\r\np. 227).]\r\n\r\nAll over the southern half of Scotland, where the dykes run along\r\nthe crests of the hills and also cross the valleys, a difference of\r\nlevel amounting to several hundred feet may often be obtained between\r\nadjacent parts of the same dyke. But the breadth of igneous rock\r\nis not perceptibly greater in the valleys than on the ridges. The\r\ndepth of boulder clay and other superficial deposits on the valley\r\nbottoms, however, too frequently conceals the dykes at their lowest\r\nlevels. Perhaps the best sections in the country for the study of this\r\ninteresting part of dyke-structure are to be found among the higher\r\nhills of the Inner Hebrides, such as the quartzites of Jura and the\r\ngranophyres and gabbros of Skye. On these bare rocky declivities,\r\nnumerous dykes may be followed from almost the sea-level up to the\r\nrugged and splintered crests, a vertical distance of between 2000 and\r\n3000 feet. The dykes are certainly not as a rule sensibly less in width\r\non the hill-tops than in the glens. So far, therefore, as I have been\r\nable to gather the evidence, there does not appear to me to be, as\r\na general rule, any appreciable variation in the width of dykes for\r\nat least 2000 or 3000 feet of their descent. The fissures which they\r\nfilled must obviously have had nearly parallel walls for a long way\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. INTERRUPTIONS OF LATERAL CONTINUITY\r\n\r\nIn tracing the great solitary dykes across the country, the geologist\r\nis often surprised to meet with gaps, varying in extent from a few\r\nhundred feet to several miles, in which no trace whatever of the\r\nigneous rock can be detected at the surface. This disappearance\r\nis not always explicable by the depth of the cover of superficial\r\naccumulations; for it may be observed over ground where the naked\r\nrocks come almost everywhere to the surface, and where, therefore, if\r\nthe conspicuous material of the dykes existed, it could not fail to\r\nbe found. No dyke supplies better illustrations of this discontinuity\r\nthan that of Cleveland. Traced north-westward across the Carboniferous\r\ntracts that lie between the mouth of the Tees and the Yale of the Eden,\r\nthis dyke disappears sometimes for a distance of six or eight miles.\r\nIn the mining ground round the head of the South Tyne the rocks are\r\nbare, so that the absence of the dyke among them can only be accounted\r\nfor by its not reaching the surface. Yet there can be no doubt that\r\nthe various separated exposures, which have the same distinctive\r\nlithological characters and occur on the same persistent line, are all\r\nportions of one dyke which is continuous at some depth below ground. We\r\nhave thus an indication of the exceedingly irregular upward limit of\r\nthe dykes, as will be more particularly discussed further on.\r\n\r\nBut there are also instances where the continuity is interrupted\r\nand then resumed on a different line. One of the best illustrations\r\nof this character is supplied by the large dyke which rises through\r\nthe hills about a mile south of Linlithgow and runs westward across\r\nthe coal-field. At Blackbraes it ends off in a point, and is not\r\nfound again to the westward in any of the coal-workings. But little\r\nmore than a quarter of a mile to the south a precisely similar dyke\r\nbegins, and strikes westward parallel to the line of the first one.\r\nThe two separated strips of igneous rock overlap each other for\r\nabout three-quarters of a mile. But that they are merely interrupted\r\nportions of what is really a single dyke can hardly be questioned. A\r\nsecond example is furnished by another of the great dykes of the same\r\ndistrict, which after running for about twelve miles in a nearly east\r\nand west direction suddenly stops at Chryston, and begins again in the\r\nsame direction, but on a line about a third of a mile further north.\r\nSuch examples serve to mark out irregularities in the great fissures up\r\nwhich the materials of the dykes rose.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. LENGTH\r\n\r\nIn those districts where the small and crowded dykes of the gregarious\r\ntype are developed, one cannot usually trace them for more than a\r\nshort distance. The longest examples known to me are those which have\r\nbeen mapped with much patience and skill by Mr. Clough in Eastern\r\nArgyleshire. Some of them he has been able to track over hill and\r\nvalley for four or five miles, though the great majority are much\r\nshorter. In Arran and in the Inner Hebrides, it is seldom possible to\r\nfollow what we can be sure is the same dyke for more than a few hundred\r\nyards. This difficulty arises partly, no doubt, from the frequent\r\nspread of peat or other superficial accumulation which conceals the\r\nrocks, and partly also from the great number of dykes and the want of\r\nsufficiently distinct lithological characters for the identification of\r\nany particular one. But making every allowance for these obstacles, we\r\nare compelled, I think, to regard the gregarious dykes as essentially\r\nshort as well as relatively irregular.\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast to these, come the great solitary dykes. In\r\nestimating their length, as I have already remarked, we must bear\r\nin mind the fact that they occasionally undergo interruptions of\r\ncontinuity owing to the local failure of the igneous material to\r\nrise to the level of what is now the surface of the ground. A narrow\r\nwall-like mass of andesite or dolerite, which sinks beneath the surface\r\nfor a few hundred yards, or for several miles, and reappears on the\r\nsame line with the same petrographical characters, while there may\r\nbe no similar rock for miles to right and left, can only be one dyke\r\nprolonged underneath in the same great line of fissure. But even if we\r\nrestrict our measurements of length to those dykes or parts of dykes\r\nwhere no serious interruption of continuity takes place, we cannot\r\nfail to be astonished at the persistence of these strips of igneous\r\nrock through the most diverse kinds of geological structure. A few\r\nillustrative examples of this feature may be selected. It will be\r\nobserved that the longest and broadest dykes are found furthest from\r\nthe basalt-plateaux, while the shortest and narrowest are most abundant\r\nnear these plateaux.\r\n\r\nNot far from what I have taken provisionally as the northern boundary\r\nof the dyke region, two dykes occur which have been mapped from the\r\nhead of Loch Goil by Arrochar across Lochs Lomond and Katrine by Ben\r\nLedi to Glen Artney, whence they strike into the Old Red Sandstone of\r\nStrathmore, and run on to the Tay near Perth--a total distance of about\r\n60 miles. If the dyke which continues in the same line on the other\r\nside of the estuary of the Tay beyond Newburgh, is a prolongation of\r\none of these, then its entire length exceeds 70 miles. A few miles\r\nfurther south, one of a group of dykes can be followed from the\r\nheart of Dumbartonshire by Callander across the Braes of Doune to\r\nAuchterarder--a distance of 47 miles, with an average breadth of more\r\nthan 100 feet. In the district between the Forth and Clyde a number\r\nof long parallel dykes can be traced for many miles across hill and\r\nplain, and through the coal-fields. One of these is continuous for\r\n25 miles from the heart of Linlithgowshire into Lanarkshire. Still\r\nlonger is the dyke which runs from the Firth of Forth at Grangemouth\r\nwestward to the Clyde, opposite Greenock--a distance of about 36 miles.\r\nComing southward, we encounter a striking series of single dykes on\r\nthe uplands between the counties of Lanark and Ayr, whence they strike\r\ninto the Silurian hills of the southern counties. One of these runs\r\nacross the crest of the Haughshaw Hills, and can be followed for some\r\n30 miles. But if, as is probable, it is prolonged in one of the dykes\r\nthat traverse the moorlands of the north of Ayrshire and south of\r\nRenfrewshire to the Clyde, its actual length must be at least twice\r\nthat distance. The great Moffat and Eskdale dyke strikes for more than\r\n50 miles across the South of Scotland and North of England. The Hawick\r\nand Cheviot dyke runs for 26 miles in Scotland and for 32 miles in\r\nNorthumberland.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable instance of persistence is furnished by the\r\nCleveland dyke. From where it is first seen near the coast-cliffs of\r\nYorkshire the strip of igneous rock can be followed, with frequent\r\ninterruptions, during which for sometimes several miles no trace of it\r\nappears at the surface, across the North of England as far as Dalston\r\nHall south of Carlisle, beyond which the ground onwards to the Solway\r\nFirth is deeply covered with superficial deposits. The total distance\r\nthrough which this dyke can be recognized is thus about 110 miles. But\r\nit probably goes further still. On the opposite side of the Solway,\r\na dyke which runs in the same line, rises through the Permian strata\r\na little to the east of the mouth of the Nith. Some miles further\r\nto the north-west, near Moniaive, Mr. J. Horne, in the progress of\r\nthe Geological Survey, traced a dark compact dyke with kernels of\r\nbasalt-glass near its margin, running in the same north-westerly\r\ndirection. Still further on in the same line, another similar rock is\r\nfound high on the flanks of the lofty hill known as Windy Standard.\r\nAnd lastly, in the Ayrshire coal-field, a dyke still continuing the\r\nsame trend, runs for several miles, and strikes out to sea near\r\nPrestwick. It cannot, of course, be proved that these detached Scottish\r\nprotrusions belong to one great dyke, or that if such a continuous dyke\r\nexists, it is a prolongation of that from Cleveland. At the same time,\r\nI am on the whole inclined to connect the various outcrops together as\r\nthose of one prolonged subterranean wall of igneous rock. The distance\r\nfrom the last visible portion of the Cleveland dyke near Carlisle to\r\nthe dyke that runs out into the Firth of Clyde near Prestwick, is about\r\n80 miles. If we consider this extension as a part of the great North\r\nof England dyke, then the total length of this remarkable geological\r\nfeature will be about 190 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. PERSISTENCE OF MINERAL CHARACTERS\r\n\r\nNot less remarkable than their length is the preservation of their\r\nnormal petrographical characters by some dykes for long distances.\r\nIn this respect the Cleveland dyke may again be cited as a typical\r\nexample. The megascopic and microscopic structures of the rock of this\r\ndyke distinguish it among the other eruptive rocks of the North of\r\nEngland. And these peculiarities it maintains throughout its course.[184]\r\nSimilar though less prominent uniformity may be traced among the long\r\nsolitary dykes of the South of Scotland, the chief variations in\r\nthese arising from the greater or less extent to which the original\r\nglassy magma has been retained. The same dyke will at one part of its\r\ncourse show abundant glassy matter even to the naked eye, while at a\r\nshort distance the vitreous groundmass has been devitrified, and its\r\nformer presence can only be detected with the aid of the microscope.\r\nWhere a dyke has caught up and absorbed abundant foreign materials its\r\ncomposition naturally varies considerably from point to point. Mr.\r\nHarker has observed some good examples of this variation in Skye.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: See the careful examination of this dyke by Mr. Teall,\r\n_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xl. p. 209.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n                   THE SYSTEM OF DYKES--_continued_\r\n\r\n  Direction--Termination upward--Known vertical Extension--Evidence\r\n  as to the movement of the Molten Rock in the Fissures--Branches and\r\n  Veins--Connection of Dykes with Intrusive Sheets--Intersection of\r\n  Dykes--Dykes of more than one infilling--Contact Metamorphism of\r\n  the Dykes--Relation of the Dykes to the Geological Structure of the\r\n  Districts which they traverse--Data for estimating the Geological\r\n  Age of the Dykes--Origin and History of the Dykes.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. DIRECTION\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic feature of the dykes is their generally\r\nrectilinear course. So true are the solitary dykes to their normal\r\ntrend that, in spite of varying inequalities of surface and wide\r\ndiversities of geological structure in the districts which they\r\ntraverse, they run over hill and dale almost with the straightness\r\nof lines of Roman road. In the districts where the gregarious type\r\nprevails, the dykes depart most widely from the character of the great\r\nsolitary series, but still tend to run in straight or approximately\r\nstraight lines, or, if wavy in their course, to preserve a general\r\nparallelism of direction.\r\n\r\nYet even among the great persistent dykes instances may be cited where\r\nthe rectilinear trend is exchanged for a succession of zig-zags, though\r\nthe normal direction is on the whole maintained. In such cases, it is\r\nevident that the fissures were not long straight dislocations, like the\r\nlarger lines of fault in the earth's crust, but were rather notched\r\nrents or cracks which, though keeping, on the whole, one dominant\r\ndirection, were continually being deflected for short distances to\r\neither side. As a good illustration of this character, reference may be\r\nmade to the Cheviot and Hawick dyke. In Teviotdale, this dyke can be\r\nfollowed continuously among the rocky knolls, so that its deviations\r\ncan be seen and mapped. From the median line of average trend the\r\nsalient angles sometimes retire fully a quarter of a mile on either\r\nside. Some examples of the same feature may be noticed in the Eskdale\r\ndyke. The large dyke which runs westward from Dunoon has been observed\r\nby Mr. Clough to change sharply in direction three times in four\r\nmiles, running occasionally for a short distance at a right angle to\r\nits general direction (see Fig. 257).\r\n\r\nAmong these solitary dykes also, though the persistence of their trend\r\nis so predominant, there occur instances where the general direction\r\nundergoes great change. Some of the most remarkable cases of this\r\nkind have been mapped by Mr. B. N. Peach and Mr. R. L. Jack, in the\r\ncourse of the Geological Survey of Perthshire. Several important\r\ndykes strike across the Old Red Sandstone plain for many miles in a\r\ndirection slightly south of west. But when they approach the rocks of\r\nthe Highland border in Glen Artney, they bend round to south-west, and\r\ncontinue their course along that new line.\r\n\r\nMany years ago I called attention to the dominant trend of the dykes\r\nfrom north-west to south-east.[185] Subsequent research has shown this\r\nto be on the whole the prevalent direction throughout the whole region\r\nof dykes. But the detailed mapping, carried on by my colleagues and\r\nmyself in the Geological Survey, has brought to light some curious and\r\ninteresting variations from the normal trend. In the districts where\r\ndykes of the gregarious type abound there is sometimes no one prevalent\r\ndirection, but the dykes strike to almost all points of the compass.\r\nOf the Arran dykes, so carefully catalogued by Necker, only about a\r\nthird have a general north-westerly course. But in Eastern Argyleshire\r\nthe abundant dykes mapped by Mr. Clough trend almost without exception\r\ntowards N.N.W. In the North of Ireland, Berger found the direction\r\nof thirty-one dykes to vary from 17° to 71° W. of N., giving a mean\r\nof N. 36° W.[186] In Islay, Jura, Eigg, Mull, and Skye the mean of\r\nseveral hundred observations has given me similar results. Among the\r\nInner Hebrides, however, though the general north-westerly trend is\r\ncharacteristic, many of the later dykes show marked departures from it.\r\nThus in Strath, Skye, some of the youngest follow a nearly north and\r\nsouth direction (Fig. 253). In the Blath Bhein hill-range, Mr. Harker\r\nhas found that the latest dykes cut the gabbro at right angles to the\r\nprevalent trend and are further distinguished by their low hade.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ xxii. (1861), p. 650.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 186: _Trans. Geol. Soc._ iii. p. 225.]\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, that though there is sometimes extraordinary\r\nlocal diversity in the direction of the dykes in those districts where\r\nthey present the gregarious type, the general north-westerly trend\r\ncan usually still be recognized. But when we turn to the long massive\r\nsolitary dykes, we soon perceive a remarkable change in their direction\r\nas we follow them northward into Scotland. I formerly pointed out how\r\nthe general north-westerly trend becomes east and west in the Lothians,\r\nwith a tendency to veer a little to the south of west and north of\r\neast.[187] This departure from the normal direction is now seen to be\r\npart of a remarkable radial arrangement of the dykes. Beginning at\r\nthe southern margin of the dyke-region, we have the notable example\r\nof the Cleveland dyke, which in its course from Cleveland to Carlisle\r\nruns nearly W. 15° N. The Eskdale dyke has an average trend of W.\r\n32° N., and the same general direction is maintained by the group of\r\ndykes which run from the Southern Uplands across the south-west of\r\nLanarkshire and north-east of Ayrshire. But proceeding northwards\r\nwe observe the trend to turn gradually round towards the west. The\r\ndyke that runs from near the mouth of the Coquet across the Cheviot\r\nHills to beyond Hawick has a general course of W. 8° N. In the great\r\ncentral coal-field of Scotland the average direction may be taken to\r\nbe nearly east and west, the same dyke running sometimes to the north,\r\nand sometimes to the south of that line. But immediately to the north\r\na decided tendency to veer round southwards makes its appearance. Thus\r\nthe long dyke which runs from the Carse of Stirling through the Campsie\r\nFells to the Clyde west of Leven, has a mean direction of W. 5° S. This\r\ncontinues to be the prevalent trend of the remarkable series of dykes\r\nwhich crosses the Old Red Sandstone plains, though some of these revert\r\nin whole or in part to the more usual direction by keeping a little to\r\nthe north of west. Even as far as Loch Tay and the head of Strathardle,\r\nthe course of the dykes continues to be to the south of west. Tracing\r\nthese lines upon a map of the country we perceive that they radiate\r\nfrom an area lying along the eastern part of Argyleshire and the head\r\nof the Firth of Clyde (see Map I.).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ xxii. p. 651.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 241.--Section along the line of the Cleveland Dyke\r\nat Cliff Ridge, Guisbrough (G. Barrow).\r\n\r\nScale, 12 inches to 1 mile.]\r\n\r\n\r\n10. TERMINATION UPWARDS\r\n\r\nIt was pointed out many years ago by Winch that some of the dykes\r\nwhich traverse the Northumberland coal-field do not cut the overlying\r\nMagnesian Limestone. The Hett dyke, south of Durham, is said to end\r\noff abruptly against the floor of the limestone.[188] Here and there,\r\namong the precipices of the Inner Hebrides, a dyke may be seen to die\r\nout before it reaches the top of the cliff. But in the vast majority\r\nof cases, no evidence remains as to how the dykes terminated upwards.\r\nI have referred to the occasional interruptions of the continuity of\r\na dyke, where, though the rock does not reach the surface, it must be\r\npresent in the fissure underneath. Such interruptions show that, in\r\nsome places at least, there was no rise of the rock even up to the\r\nlevel of what is now the surface of the ground, and that the upward\r\nlimit of the dykes must have been exceedingly irregular.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188: This is expressed in the Geological Survey Map, Sheet 93,\r\nN.E.]\r\n\r\nExcellent illustrations of this feature are supplied by sections on\r\nthe line of the Cleveland dyke. Towards its south-easterly extremity,\r\nthis great band of igneous rock ascends from the low Triassic plain of\r\nthe Tees into the high uplands of Cleveland. Its course across the\r\nridges and valleys there has been carefully traced for the Geological\r\nSurvey by Mr. G. Barrow, who has shown that over certain parts of its\r\ncourse it does not reach the surface, but remains concealed under the\r\nJurassic rocks, which it never succeeded in penetrating. But that in\r\nplaces it comes within a few feet of the soil is shown by the baked\r\nshale at the surface, for the alteration which it has induced on the\r\nsurrounding rocks only extends a few feet from its margin. These\r\ninterruptions of continuity show how uneven is the upper limit of the\r\ndyke. The characteristic porphyritic rock may be observed running up\r\none side of a hill to the crest, but never reaching the surface on the\r\nother side. At Cliff Ridge, for example, about three miles south-west\r\nof Guisbrough, Mr. Barrow has followed it up to the summit on the\r\nwest side; but has found that on the east side it does not pierce the\r\nshales, which there form the declivity. This structure is represented\r\nin Fig 241. The vertical distance between the summit to the left, where\r\nthe dyke (_b_) disappears, and the point to the right, where the Lias\r\nshale (_a_) of the hillside is concealed by drift (_c_), amounts to 250\r\nfeet, the horizontal distance being a little more than 900 feet. But as\r\nthe shale when last seen at the foot of the slope is quite unaltered,\r\nthe dyke must there be still some little distance beneath the surface,\r\nso that the vertical extension of this upward tongue of the dyke must\r\nbe more than 250 feet. Mr. Barrow, to whom I am indebted for these\r\nparticulars, has also drawn the accompanying section (Fig. 242) along\r\nthe course of the dyke for a distance of nearly 11 miles eastward from\r\nthe locality represented in Fig. 241. From this section it will be\r\nobserved that in that space there are at least three tongues or upward\r\nprojections of the upper limit of the dyke. Several additional examples\r\nof the same structure are to be seen further east towards the last\r\nvisible outcrop of the dyke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 242.--Section along the course of the Cleveland\r\nDyke, at the head of Lonsdale, Yorkshire (G. Barrow, in the _Memoirs of\r\nthe Geol. Surrey_, Geology of Cleveland, p. 61).\r\n\r\n_a_, Liassic shales, sandstones and ironstones; _b_, the dyke.]\r\n\r\nAnother feature connected with the upward termination of the dyke is\r\nwell seen in some parts of the ground through which the two foregoing\r\nsections are taken. Mr. Barrow informs me that at Ayton a level course\r\nhas been driven into the hill for mining operations, at a height of 400\r\nfeet above sea-level, and the dyke has there been ascertained to be 80\r\nfeet broad. Higher on the hill, close to the 750 feet contour--line,\r\nits breadth is only 20 feet, so that it narrows upward as much as 60\r\nfeet in a vertical height of 350 feet. Its contraction in width during\r\nthe last twenty feet is still more rapid, and in the last few yards it\r\ndiminishes to two or three feet, and has a rounded top over which the\r\nstrata are bent upward. The accompanying section (Fig. 243) across the\r\nupper part of the dyke will make these features clear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 243.--Section across the extreme upper limit of\r\nCleveland Dyke, on the scale of 20 feet to one inch (Mr. G. Barrow).\r\n\r\n_a_ _a_, Jurassic shales, etc.; _b_, Dyke.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 244.--Upper limit of Cleveland Dyke in quarry near\r\nCockfield (after Mr. Teall).\r\n\r\n_a_ _a_, Carboniferous shales; _b_, dyke.]\r\n\r\nFurther to the west an exposure of the upper limit of the dyke has been\r\ndescribed and figured by Mr. Teall. In 1882, at one of the Cockfield\r\nquarries (Fig. 244), the dyke was \"seen to terminate upwards very\r\nabruptly in the form of a low and somewhat irregular dome, over which\r\nthe Coal-measure shales passed without any fracture, and only with a\r\nslight upward arching.\"[189]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ xl. p. 210.]\r\n\r\nNear the other or north-western termination of this great dyke, similar\r\nevidence is found of an uneven upper limit. After an interrupted course\r\nthrough the Alston moors, the dyke reaches the ground that slopes\r\neastward from the edge of the Cross Fell escarpment. Its highest\r\nvisible outcrop is at a height of 1700 feet. But westwards from that\r\npoint the dyke disappears under the Carboniferous rocks, and does not\r\nemerge along the front of the great escarpment that descends upon the\r\nvalley of the Eden, where among the naked scarps of rock it would\r\nunquestionably be visible if it reached the surface. Its upper edge\r\nmust rapidly descend somewhere behind the face of the escarpment, for\r\nthe igneous rock crops out a little to the west of the foot of the\r\ncliff, about 1000 feet below the point where it is last seen on the\r\nhills above. Here the top of the dyke has a vertical drop of not less\r\nthan 1000 feet, in a horizontal distance of five miles, as shown in\r\nFig. 245, which has been drawn for me by Mr. J. G. Goodchild.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that in these sections (Figs. 241, 242 and 245)\r\nthere is a curiously approximate coincidence between the inequalities\r\nin the upper surface of the dyke and those in the form of the overlying\r\nground. The coincidence is too marked and too often repeated to be\r\nmerely accidental. Whether the ancient topographical features had any\r\ninfluence in determining, by cooling or otherwise, the limit of the\r\nupward rise of the lava, or whether the dyke, even though concealed,\r\nhas affected the progress of the denudation of the ground overlying it,\r\nis a question worthy of fuller investigation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 245.--Section along the course of the Cleveland Dyke\r\nacross the Cross Fell escarpment. The shaded part shows the position of\r\nthe dyke, the unshaded part overlying it marks where the dyke does not\r\nreach the surface. Scale of one inch to one mile.]\r\n\r\n\r\n11. KNOWN VERTICAL EXTENSION\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the determination of the upper limit reached by\r\nthe dykes, is the total vertical distance to which they can be traced.\r\nOf course, the depth of the original reservoir of molten rock which\r\nsupplied them remains unknown, and probably undiscoverable. But it is\r\npossible, in many cases, to determine at least the inferior limit of\r\nthe thickness of rock through which the molten material of the dykes\r\nhas ascended. Along the great basalt-escarpments of Mull and Skye,\r\nthe ascent of dykes from base to summit may often be observed. Thus,\r\non the cliffs of Dunvegan Head, on the west coast of Skye, which rise\r\nout of the sea to a height of about 1000 feet, several dykes may be\r\nobserved rising through the whole series of basalts up to the crest of\r\nthe precipice. In the dark gabbro hills of the same island, numerous\r\ndykes may be seen climbing from the glens right up the steep rugged\r\nacclivities and over the crests, through a vertical thickness of more\r\nthan 3000 feet of rock (Fig. 333). The dykes which cross Loch Lomond,\r\nand ascend the hills on either side of that deep depression, must rise\r\nthrough at least as great a thickness. But where a knowledge of the\r\ngeological structure of the ground enables us to estimate the bulk of\r\nthe successive rock-formations which underlie the surface, it can be\r\nshown that the lava ascended through a much greater depth of rock.\r\nMeasurements of this kind can best be made towards the eastern end\r\nof the Cleveland dyke, where the different sedimentary groups have\r\nnot been seriously disturbed, and where, from natural sections and\r\nartificial borings, their thicknesses are capable of satisfactory\r\ncomputation. The highest bed of the Jurassic series anywhere touched\r\nby the dyke is the Cornbrash. It is certain, therefore, that the\r\nigneous rock rises through all the subjacent members of the Jurassic\r\nseries up to that horizon. There can be no doubt also that the Trias\r\nand Magnesian Limestone continue in their normal thickness underneath\r\nthe Jurassic strata. To what extent the Coal-measures exist under\r\nCleveland has not been ascertained; possibly they have been entirely\r\ndenuded from that area, as from the ground to the west. But the\r\nMillstone Grit and Carboniferous Limestone probably extend over the\r\ndistrict in full development; and below them there must lie a vast\r\ndepth of Upper and Lower Silurian strata, probably also of still older\r\nPalæozoic rocks and beneath all the thick Archæan platform. Tabulating\r\nthese successive geological formations, and taking only the ascertained\r\nthickness of each in the district, we find that they give the results\r\nshown in the subjoined table.[190]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 190: Drawn up for me by Mr. G. Barrow.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRATA CUT BY THE CLEVELAND DYKE\r\n\r\n    Cornbrash--\r\n                                                                   Feet.\r\n  Lower Oolite and Upper Lias, as proved by bore-hole on\r\n      Gerrick Moor,                                                  950\r\n  Middle and Lower Lias, ascertained from measurement of\r\n      cliff-sections and from mining operations to be more than      850\r\n  New Red Sandstone and Marl, found by boring close to the Tees\r\n      to exceed                                                    1,600\r\n  Magnesian Limestone, at least                                      500\r\n  Coal-measures, possibly absent                                       0\r\n  Millstone Grit, not less than                                      500\r\n  Carboniferous Limestone series at least                          3,000\r\n  Silurian rocks, probably not less than                          10,000\r\n                                                                 -------\r\n                                                                  17,400\r\n\r\nThere is thus evidence that this dyke has risen through probably more\r\nthan three miles of stratified rocks. How much deeper still lay the\r\noriginal reservoir of molten material that supplied the dyke, we have\r\nat present no means of computing.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. EVIDENCE AS TO MOVEMENT OF THE MOLTEN ROCK IN THE FISSURES\r\n\r\nIt is usual to speak of the molten material of the dykes as having\r\nrisen vertically within the fissures. And doubtless, on the whole,\r\nthe expression is sufficiently accurate. In the case of such long\r\ndykes as those of Central Scotland and the North of England, where the\r\npetrographical character of the material remains so uniform throughout,\r\nit is obvious that the andesite or dolerite cannot have come from a\r\nmere single pipe like a volcanic orifice. Nor can we easily understand\r\nhow it could have been supplied even from a series of such pipes. The\r\ngeneral aspect and structure of the dykes suggest that the fissures\r\nwere rent so profoundly in the crust of the earth as to reach down to\r\na reservoir of molten rock which straightway rose in them. The roof of\r\nsuch a reservoir, however, may have been irregular and uneven, so that\r\na fissure need not have traversed it continuously, but may have only\r\ntouched its upward projecting vaults. Hence gaps would arise in the\r\ncontinuity of the dyke-material.\r\n\r\nThe ascent of lava from a line of such separate openings along a\r\nfissure would necessarily involve lateral as well as vertical movements\r\nin the molten mass which would be forced along the open rent until\r\nthe several streams united and filled it up. We might therefore\r\nexpect somewhere to find instances of flow-structure in the dykes\r\npointing to these movements. I have already referred to the lines of\r\namygdales frequently noticed in dykes, especially towards the centre.\r\nOccasionally these steam-vesicles may be observed to be drawn out in\r\none general direction indicative of the trend of motion of the molten\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nSome of the best examples of this feature which have come under my\r\nobservation occur among the trachytic dykes of the south-east coast of\r\nSkye between Kyle Rhea and Loch na Daal, where they have been mapped\r\nand carefully investigated by Mr. Clough, who has conducted me over the\r\nsections. In some of these dykes, as already narrated, the marginal\r\nportions display a finely spherulitic structure, the small pea-like\r\nspherulites being grouped into fine ribs or rods. It is also observable\r\nthat the steam-vesicles which may retain their spherical forms in the\r\ncentre are elongated in the same direction as the rows of spherulites.\r\nWhere this lineation is developed vertically, it no doubt points to the\r\nvertical ascent of the lava between the two walls of the fissure.\r\n\r\nBut in other examples, the elongation is nearly horizontal, and between\r\nthe two positions Mr. Clough has registered many intermediate trends.\r\nIt would thus appear that in some places the lava has certainly\r\nflowed laterally between the fissure-walls. Moreover, the trend of\r\nthe spherulitic rods and of the amygdales is found to vary in closely\r\nadjoining planes at different distances from the margin, as if after\r\nthe outer portions of the dyke had consolidated into position, there\r\nwas still movement enough to drag the rows of spherulites and vesicles\r\nup or down along the trend of the fissure.\r\n\r\nMr. Clough has observed that in some dykes, while the amygdaloidal\r\nvesicles are large and undeformed in the centre, they become elongated\r\nand inclined downward in the direction of the margin, as if the central\r\nportions had not only remained fluid longer than the rest, but had a\r\ntendency to rise upwards in the fissure, though there was obviously\r\nless motion after these central vesicles appeared than in the marginal\r\nparts where the vesicles are so much drawn out.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. BRANCHING DYKES AND VEINS\r\n\r\nIt might have been anticipated that the uprise of such abundant masses\r\nof molten rock, in so many long and wide fissures, would generally be\r\nattended with the intrusion of the same material into lateral rents and\r\nirregular openings, so that each dyke would have a kind of fringe of\r\noffshoots or processes striking from it into the surrounding ground.\r\nIt might have been expected also that dykes would often branch, and\r\nthat the arms would come together again and enclose portions of the\r\nrocks through which they rise. But in reality such excrescences and\r\nbifurcations are of comparatively rare occurrence. As a rule, each\r\ndyke is a mere wall of igneous rock, with little more projection or\r\nramification than may be seen in a stone field-fence. Among the short,\r\nnarrow and irregular dykes of the gregarious type branchings are\r\noccasionally seen, and in some districts are extraordinarily abundant.\r\nBut among the great single dykes such irregularities are far less\r\ncommon than might have been looked for. A few characteristic examples\r\nfrom each type of dyke may here be given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 246.--Branching portion of the great Dyke near\r\nHawick (length about one mile).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 247.--Branching Dyke at foot of Glen Artney (length\r\nabout four miles).]\r\n\r\nThe Cleveland dyke, which in so many respects is typical of the great\r\nsolitary dykes of the country, has been traced for many miles without\r\nthe appearance of a single offshoot of any kind. Yet here and there\r\nalong its course, it departs from its usual regularity. As it crosses\r\nthe Carboniferous tracts of Durham and Cumberland, there appear near\r\nits course lateral masses of eruptive rock, most of which doubtless\r\nbelong to the much older \"Whin Sill.\" But there is at least one\r\nlocality, at Bolam near Cockfield, in the county of Durham, where\r\nthe dyke, crossing the Millstone Grit, suddenly expands into a boss,\r\nand immediately contracts to its usual dimensions. Around this knot\r\nseveral short dykes or veins seem to radiate from it. The dyke has been\r\nquarried here, and its relations to the surrounding strata have been\r\nlaid bare, as will be again referred to a little further on.[191]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 191: This locality was well described by Sedgwick, in his early\r\npaper on Trap-Dykes in Yorkshire and Durham, _Trans. Cambridge Phil.\r\nSoc._ ii. p. 27.]\r\n\r\nAmong the great persistent dykes of Scotland the absence of bifurcation\r\nand lateral offshoots offers a striking contrast to the behaviour of\r\nthe dykes in those districts where they are small in size and many in\r\nnumber. But exceptions to the general rule may be gathered. Thus the\r\nEskdale dyke is flanked at Wat Carrick with a large lateral vein, which\r\nis almost certainly connected with the main fissure. The Hawick and\r\nCheviot dyke splits up on the hill immediately to the east of the town\r\nof Hawick, sends off some branches, and then resumes its normal course\r\n(Fig. 246). Again, one of the two nearly parallel dykes which run from\r\nLochgoilhead across Ben Ledi into Glen Artney bifurcates at the foot of\r\nthat valley, its northern limb (about two miles long) speedily dying\r\nout, and its southern branch throwing off another lateral vein, and\r\nthen continuing eastward as the main dyke (Fig. 247).\r\n\r\nIn the districts of gregarious dykes, however, abundant instances\r\nmay be found of dykes that branch, and of others that lose the\r\nparallelism of their walls, become irregular in breadth, direction, and\r\ninclination, so as to pass into those intrusive forms that are more\r\nproperly classed as veins. Excellent illustrations of bifurcating dykes\r\nmay be observed along the shores of the Firth of Clyde, particularly\r\non the eastern coast-line of the isle of Arran. The venous character\r\nhas become familiar to geologists from the sketches given by Macculloch\r\nfrom the lower parts of the cliffs of Trotternish in Skye.[192] Still\r\nmore striking examples are to be seen in the breaker-beaten cliffs of\r\nArdnamurchan. The pale Secondary limestones and calcareous sandstones\r\nof that locality are traversed by a series of dark basic veins, and the\r\ncontrast of tint between the two kinds of rock is so marked as even to\r\ncatch the eye of casual tourists in the passing steamboats. The veins\r\nvary in width from less than an inch to several feet or yards. They run\r\nin all directions and intersect each other, forming such a confused\r\nmedley as requires some patience on the part of the geologist who\r\nwould follow out each independent ribbon of injected material in its\r\ncourse up the cliffs, or still more, would sketch their ramifications\r\nin his note-book. A good, though perhaps somewhat exaggerated,\r\nillustration of their general character was given by Macculloch.[193]\r\nThe accompanying figure (Fig. 248) is less sensational, but represents\r\nwith as much accuracy as I could reach, the network of veins near the\r\nfoot of the cliffs. One conspicuous group of veins, which, seen from\r\na distance, looks like a rude sketch of a lug-sail traced in black\r\noutline upon a pale ground, is known to the boatmen as \"M'Niven's\r\nSail.\" Another admirable locality for the study of dykes and tortuous\r\nveins is the northern coast of the Sound of Soa, where an extraordinary\r\nnumber of injections traverse the Torridon Sandstones on which the\r\nplateau-basalts rest (Fig. 323).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 192: _Western Islands_, plate xvii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: _Op. cit._ plate xxxiii. Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, the narrower the vein the finer in grain is the\r\nrock of which it consists. This compact dark homogeneous material has\r\ncommonly passed by the name of \"basalt.\" Its minuteness of texture\r\nprobably in most cases arises from local rapidity of cooling, and\r\nit is doubtless the same substance which, where in larger mass in\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood, has solidified as one of the other\r\npyroxene-plagioclase-magnetite rocks.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the places where such abundant tortuous veins are more\r\nespecially developed, I may remark that they are particularly prominent\r\nunder a thick overlying mass of erupted rock, such as a great intrusive\r\nsheet, or the bedded basalts of the plateaux, or where there is good\r\nreason to believe that such a deep cover, though now removed by\r\ndenudation, once overspread the area in which they appear. It will be\r\nshown in the sequel that such horizons have been peculiarly liable to\r\nintrusions of igneous material of various kinds, and at many different\r\nintervals, during the volcanic period. A thick cake of crystalline rock\r\nseems to have offered such resistance to the uprise of molten material\r\nthrough it, that when the subterranean energy was not sufficient to\r\nrend it open by great fissures, and thus give rise to dykes, the lavas\r\nwere either forced into such irregular cracks as were made partly in\r\nthe softer rocks underneath and partly in the cake itself, or found\r\nescape along pre-existing divisional planes. In Ardnamurchan, round the\r\nCuillin Hills of Skye, and in Rum, the overlying resisting cover now\r\nconsists mainly of gabbro sheets. In the east of Skye, in Eigg, and in\r\nAntrim, it is made up of the thick mass of the plateau-basalts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 248.--Basic veins traversing secondary limestone\r\nand sandstone on the coast cliffs, Ardnamurchan.]\r\n\r\n\r\n14. CONNECTION OF DYKES WITH SILLS\r\n\r\nEvery field-geologist is aware how seldom he can actually find the vent\r\nor pipe up which rose the igneous rock that supplied the material of\r\nsills and laccolites. He might well be pardoned were he to anticipate\r\nthat, in a district much traversed by dykes, there should be many\r\nexamples of intrusive sheets and frequent opportunities of tracing the\r\nconnection of such sheets with the fissures from which their material\r\nmight be supposed to have been supplied. But such an expectation is\r\nsingularly disappointed by an actual examination of the Tertiary\r\nvolcanic region of Britain. That there are many intrusive sheets\r\nbelonging to the great volcanic period with which I am now dealing,\r\nI shall endeavour to show in the sequel. But it is quite certain that\r\nthough these sheets have of course each had its subterranean pipe\r\nor fissure of supply, they can only in rare instances be directly\r\ntraced to the system of dykes. On the other hand, the districts\r\nwhere great single dykes are most conspicuous, are for the most part\r\nfree from intrusive sheets, except those of much older date, like\r\nthe Carboniferous Whin Sill of Durham and those of Linlithgowshire,\r\nStirlingshire and Fife.\r\n\r\nYet a few interesting examples of the relation of dykes to sheets\r\nhave been noticed among British Tertiary volcanic rocks. The earliest\r\nobserved instances were those figured and described by Macculloch.\r\nAmong them one has been familiar to geologists from having done duty\r\nin text-books of the science for more than half a century. I allude to\r\nthe diagram of \"Trap and Sandstone near Suishnish.\"[194] In that drawing\r\nseven dykes are shown as rising vertically through the horizontal\r\nsandstone, and merging into a thick overlying mass of \"trap.\" The\r\nauthor in his explanation leaves it an open question \"whether the\r\nintruding material has ascended from below and overflowed the strata,\r\nor has descended from the mass,\" though from the language he uses in\r\nhis text we may infer that he was inclined to regard the overlying body\r\nas the source of the veins below it.[195]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: _Western Islands of Scotland_, pl. xiv. Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: _Op. cit._ vol. i. pp. 384, 385.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 249.--Section showing the connection of a Dyke with\r\nan Intrusive Sheet, Point of Suisnish, Skye.\r\n\r\n  _g_, Granophyre of Carn Dearg; _f_, similar rock, which appears\r\n  eastward under the \"sill\" (_d_); _e_, intrusive sheet of\r\n  fine-grained \"basalt\"; _d_, intrusive sheet or sill of coarse\r\n  dolerite, 200 feet thick at its maximum, and rapidly thinning out;\r\n  _c_, dyke or pipe of finer grain than _d_; _b_, yellowish-brown\r\n  shaly sandstones, and _a_, dark sandy shales (Lias).\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe section given by Macculloch, however, does not quite accurately\r\nrepresent the facts. The narrow dykes there drawn have no connection\r\nwith the overlying sheet, but are part of the abundant series of\r\nbasaltic dykes found all over Skye. The feeder of the gabbro sill was\r\npresumably the broad dyke which descends the steep bank immediately\r\non the southern front of Carn Dearg (636 feet high). The accompanying\r\nfigure (Fig. 249) shows what seemed to me to be the structure of the\r\nlocality, but the actual junction of the dyke and sheet is concealed\r\nunder the talus of the slope.[196] I shall have occasion in a later\r\nChapter to refer again to this section in connection with the history\r\nof intrusive sheets, and also to cite from the neighbouring island of\r\nRaasay another good example of the same relation between dyke and sill.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: In more recently surveying this ground, Mr. Harker\r\nhas been led to regard the coarse sill as independent of the other\r\nintrusions, and as almost certainly later than the basalt-sheets of\r\nthe same locality. When it reaches the base of these sills it turns so\r\nas to pass beneath them as a gabbro-sill, which is conspicuous near\r\nthe summit of Carn Dearg. It runs westward for some distance, almost\r\nimmediately breaking across the bedding so as to leave the basalt, and\r\nrapidly tapering until it dies out.]\r\n\r\nSedgwick, in the paper above quoted, gave an account and figure of the\r\nexpansion of the Cleveland dyke at Bolam, to which allusion has already\r\nbeen made. He showed that from a part of the dyke which is unusually\r\ncontracted a great lateral extension of the igneous rock takes place on\r\neither side over beds of shale and coal. While in the dyke the prisms\r\nare as usual directed horizontally inward from the two walls, those\r\nin the connected sheet are vertical, and descend upon the surface of\r\nhighly indurated strata on which the sheet rests.\r\n\r\nThe most important examples known to me are those which occur in\r\nthe coal-field of Stirlingshire. In that part of the country, the\r\nremarkable group of dykes already referred to, lying nearly parallel\r\nto each other and from half a mile to about three miles apart, runs in\r\na general east and west direction. From one of these dykes no fewer\r\nthan four sills strike off into the surrounding Coal-measures. The\r\nlargest of them stretches southwards for three miles, but the same\r\nrock is probably continued in a succession of detached areas which\r\nspread westwards through the coal-field and circle round to near the\r\ntwo western sheets that proceeded from the same dyke. Another thick\r\nmass of similar rock extends on the north side of the dyke for two\r\nand a half miles down the valley of the river Avon. These various\r\nprocesses, attached to or diverging from the dyke, are unquestionably\r\nintrusive sheets, which occupy different horizons in the Carboniferous\r\nseries. The one on the north side has inserted itself a little above\r\nthe top of the Carboniferous Limestone series. Those on the south side\r\nlie on different levels in the Coal-measures, or, rather, they pass\r\ntransgressively from one platform to another in that group of strata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 250.--Section to show the connection of a Dyke with\r\nan Intrusive Sheet, Stirlingshire Coal-field.\r\n\r\n_a_, Dyke in line of fault; _b_, Sill traversing and altering the coal;\r\n_i_, Slaty-band Ironstone.]\r\n\r\nNo essential difference can be detected by the naked eye between the\r\nmaterial of the dyke and that of the sheets. If a series of specimens\r\nfrom the different exposures were mixed up, it would be impossible to\r\nseparate those of the dyke from those of the sheets. A microscopical\r\nexamination of the specimens likewise shows that they are perfectly\r\nidentical in composition and structure, being chiefly referable to\r\nrocks of the dolerite, but partly of the tholeiite type. I have\r\ntherefore little doubt that these remarkable appendages to this dyke\r\nare truly offshoots from it, and are not to be classed with the general\r\nmass of the sills of Central Scotland, which are of Carboniferous,\r\npartly of Permian, age. The accompanying diagrammatic section (Fig.\r\n250) explains the geological structure of the ground.\r\n\r\nAn interesting and important fact remains to be stated in connection\r\nwith these sheets. They are traversed by some of the other east\r\nand west dykes. This is particularly observable in the case of the\r\nsheet which extends northwards from the dyke through the parish of\r\nTorphichen. Two well-marked dykes can be seen running westwards among\r\nthe ridges of the sheet. It is obvious, therefore that these particular\r\ndykes are younger than the sheet. But, as will be shown in the sequel,\r\nthere is abundant evidence that all the dykes of a district are not of\r\none eruption. The intersection of one eruptive mass by another does\r\nnot necessarily imply any long interval of time between them. They\r\nmark successive, but it may be rapidly successive, manifestations of\r\nvolcanic action. Hence the cutting of the sheets by other dykes does\r\nnot invalidate the identification of these sheets as extravasations\r\nfrom the great dyke by which they are bounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. INTERSECTION OF DYKES\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 251.--Intersection of Dykes in bedded basalt,\r\nCalliach Point, Mull.]\r\n\r\nInnumerable instances may be cited, where one dyke, or one set\r\nof dykes, cuts across another. To some of these I shall refer in\r\ndiscussing the data for estimating the relative ages of dykes. In\r\nconsidering the intersection from the point of view of geological\r\nstructure, we are struck with the clean sharp way in which it so\r\ngenerally takes place. The rents into which the younger dykes have\r\nbeen injected seem, as a rule, not to have been sensibly influenced\r\nin width and direction by the older dykes, but go right across them.\r\nHence the younger dykes retain their usual breadth and trend (Fig.\r\n251). In trying to ascertain the relative ages of such dykes we obtain\r\na valuable clue in studying the respective \"chilled edges\" of the two\r\nintersecting masses, as has already been pointed out.\r\n\r\nNot only do dykes cross each other, but still more is this the case\r\namong the narrower tortuous intrusions known as Veins (Fig. 252). Among\r\nthe illustrations which the dykes of the Inner Hebrides supply of these\r\nfeatures one further characteristic example may be culled from the\r\nshore of Skye, near Broadford, where the gently-inclined sheets of Lias\r\nlimestone are traversed by three systems of dykes (Fig. 253). One of\r\nthese systems runs in a N.W. or N.N.W. direction, a second follows a\r\nmore nearly easterly trend, while the third and youngest runs nearly\r\nnorth and south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 252.--Basalt Veins traversing bedded dolerites, Kildonan, Eigg.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 253.--Ground-plan of intersecting Dykes in Lias limestone,\r\n  Shore, Harrabol, East of Broadford, Skye.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n16. DYKES OF MORE THAN ONE IN-FILLING\r\n\r\nThe intersections of dykes prove that the process of fissuring in\r\nthe earth's crust took place at more than one period, and prepare us\r\nfor the reception of evidence that the same line of fissure might be\r\nagain re-opened, even after it had been filled with molten material.\r\nNumerous instances have now been accumulated in which dykes are not\r\nsingle or simple intrusions, but where the original dyke-fissure has\r\nbeen re-opened and has been invaded by successive uprisings of lava.[197]\r\nCompound dykes have thus been formed, consisting of two or more\r\nparallel bands of similar or dissimilar rock.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: See an example figured by Macculloch, _Western Isles_,\r\nplate xviii. Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nWhile it is not difficult to conceive of the re-opening of a vertical\r\nfissure during terrestrial strain, and the injection into it of later\r\nintrusions of a volcanic magma, it is not so easy to understand the\r\nmechanism where the line of weakness has been slightly inclined or\r\nhorizontal, and where, consequently, there has been the enormous\r\nsuperincumbent pressure of the overlying part of the earth's crust to\r\novercome. Yet gently inclined compound dykes exhibit their parallel\r\nbands with hardly less regularity than do those that are vertical.\r\nThe difficulty of explanation is felt most strongly in the attempt to\r\nrealize the origin of the compound sills described in Chapter xlviii.\r\n\r\nIn the re-opening of dyke-fissures the later intrusions have generally\r\ntaken place along the walls, or where the dykes were already compound,\r\nbetween some of the component bands. Less frequently the first dyke has\r\nbeen split open along the middle, and a second injection has forced its\r\nway along the rent.\r\n\r\nOf the first of these two types, numerous instances have now been\r\nobserved in the West of Scotland. If the portion of a compound dyke\r\nexposed at the surface be limited in extent, we may be unable to\r\ndetermine which is the older of two parallel bands of igneous rock,\r\nthough the fact that they present to each other the usual fine-grained\r\nedge due to more rapid cooling, shows that they are not one but two\r\ndykes, belonging to distinct eruptions. So far as I have noticed,\r\nwhere one of the dykes can be continuously traced for a considerable\r\ndistance, the other is comparatively short. I infer that the shorter\r\none is the younger of the two.\r\n\r\nIn the Strath district of Skye, Mr. Harker has recently observed that\r\nmany of the basic dykes, both those older and those younger than the\r\ngranophyre protrusions, are double, triple or multiple. Thus in a\r\nconspicuous dyke, more than 100 feet wide, to the south-east of Loch\r\nKilchrist, belonging to the older series, he has detected at least six\r\ncontiguous dykes which as they are traced south-eastward, in spite\r\nof their interruption by the Beinn an Dubhaich granite, can be seen\r\nto separate and take different courses, or successively die out. He\r\nremarks, further, that \"many cases of apparent bifurcation of dykes are\r\nreally due to the separation of distinct dykes which have run for some\r\ndistance in one fissure. Sometimes apparent variations in the width of\r\na dyke are to be explained by this dying out of one member of a double\r\ndyke. These multiple dykes are less easily detected in the newer than\r\nthe older set, owing to greater uniformity of lithological type in the\r\nprevalent kinds and to the frequent absence of chilled selvages.\"[198] An\r\nexample of a compound basic dyke cutting the crest of the gabbro-mass\r\nof the Cuillin Hills is shown in Fig. 333.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: MS. notes supplied by Mr. Harker.]\r\n\r\nInstances of the second type of compound dykes are less common. Here,\r\ninstead of being re-opened along one of the walls, the fissure has\r\nbeen ruptured along the centre of the dyke, and a second injection of\r\nmolten material has then taken place. This structure may be observed\r\nwhere the materials of the compound dyke are on the whole similar,\r\nsuch as varieties of dolerite, basalt, diabase or andesite. In these\r\ncases the rock of the central dyke is generally rather fine-grained,\r\nsometimes decidedly porphyritic, and often a true basalt. Where broad\r\nenough to show the difference of texture between margin and centre, it\r\nexhibits the usual close grain along its edges, indicative of quicker\r\ncooling. The older dyke presenting no such change at its junction with\r\nthe younger, was obviously already cooled and consolidated before its\r\nrupture.\r\n\r\nWhilst the centre of a dyke has occasionally proved to be a line of\r\nweakness which has given way under intense strains in the terrestrial\r\ncrust, this rupture and the accompanying or subsequent ascent of molten\r\nmaterial in the re-opened fissure may sometimes have been included as\r\nphases of one connected volcanic episode. In those instances, for\r\nexample, which have been above described, where a central vitreous band\r\nhas risen along the heart of a dyke, the petrographical affinities of\r\nthe rocks may be so close as to suggest that although the main dyke had\r\nconsolidated and had subsequently been ruptured along its centre by\r\npowerful earth-movements, these changes all belonged to the same period\r\nof dyke-making, and the subsequent uprise of glassy material was merely\r\na later phase in the movements of the same subterranean magma.\r\n\r\nBut where, as probably happens in the large majority of compound dykes,\r\nthere is a strongly marked difference between the respective bands\r\nof rock, we must either infer that two essentially different magmas\r\nco-existed in the volcanic reservoirs underneath, and were successively\r\ninjected into the same fissures, or that a sufficient lapse of time\r\noccurred to permit a total renewal of the nature of the magma, and an\r\nuprise of this changed material into fissures which sometimes coincided\r\nwith older dykes. If any interlocking of the crystals of the several\r\nbands of a compound dyke could be detected, we might suppose that the\r\nfirst-injected material had not become consolidated and cold before\r\nthe uprise of the newer rock. But in general it would seem that so\r\nsharp a line of demarcation can be drawn between the two rocks as to\r\nindicate that their protrusion was due to two distinct and perhaps\r\nwidely-separated volcanic paroxysms.\r\n\r\nCompound dykes of basic material occur not only among the ordinary\r\nstraight north-westerly series, but also among the less regular\r\ngregarious dykes and veins, such as abundantly intersect the gabbro\r\nbosses. Moreover they are to be found among the youngest intrusions,\r\nfor they traverse the masses of granophyre. Conspicuous examples of\r\nsuch late compound dykes are displayed along the cliffs of St. Kilda,\r\nas will be more particularly described in a later Chapter. These St.\r\nKilda dykes often occupy not vertical fissures but parallel rents with\r\na gentle inclination (see Figs. 367, 368).\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary volcanic series of Scotland furnishes many examples of\r\ncompound dykes of a much more complex character where parallel bands\r\nof some acid (granophyre, felsite, quartz-porphyry) or intermediate\r\n(andesite) rock is associated with others of the more usual basic\r\nmaterial (dolerite, basalt, diabase). As the acid intrusions belong\r\nto a comparatively late part of the volcanic history, their modes of\r\noccurrence will be discussed in Chapters xlvi., xlvii. and xlviii. But\r\nno account of the general system of dykes would be complete without\r\nsome reference to these compound examples, which will therefore be\r\nbriefly described in the present section of this work.\r\n\r\nEarly in this century some striking illustrations of the association\r\nof acid and more basic rocks within the same fissure were noticed by\r\nJameson in the island of Arran. He described and figured instances at\r\nTormore, on the west side of that island, where a group of pitchstones\r\nand \"basalts\" or andesites have been successively protruded into\r\nthe same fissures in the (probably Permian) red sandstones of that\r\ndistrict.[199]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: _Mineralogy of the Scottish Isles_, 1800.]\r\n\r\nIn some instances the more basic rock has been first injected, and has\r\nsubsequently been disrupted, by the more acid pitchstone. In other\r\ncases the order has been the reverse. The successive ruptures have\r\ntaken place sometimes along the centre, sometimes at the margins, and\r\nsometimes irregularly along the breadth of the dykes. Professor Judd\r\nhas recently studied these rocks, and has given descriptions of their\r\nchemical composition and microscopic characters. He regards them as\r\nhaving been successively injected into the fissures from the same\r\nsubterranean reservoir, in which two magmas of very different chemical\r\nconstitution were simultaneously present.[200]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 200: _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlix. (1893), p. 536.\r\nFull details of the compound dykes of Tormore and Cir Mhor in Arran,\r\nand references to previous writers will be found in this paper. The\r\nprobable age of the youngest eruptive rocks of this island will be\r\ndiscussed in Chapter xlvii. p. 418.]\r\n\r\nNowhere in the Tertiary volcanic regions of Britain do compound dykes\r\nappear to be so abundant as in the centre and southern part of the\r\nisland of Skye. During the progress of the Geological Survey in that\r\ndistrict, Mr. Clough and Mr. Harker have mapped a large number in the\r\nground between the Sound of Sleat and the Red Hills. With regard to\r\nthese dykes Mr. Harker observes that the several members are generally\r\npetrographically different, some being basic, others intermediate,\r\nand others acid. \"There is usually,\" he remarks, \"a symmetrical\r\ndisposition, two similar and more basic dykes being divided by a more\r\nacid one; for example, two andesites separated by a pitchstone. Thus at\r\nthe mouth of the little stream which runs from Torran into the bay east\r\nfrom Dùn Beag a dyke, apparently 18 feet wide, is found on examination\r\nto consist of a central dyke (specific gravity 2·86) flanked by two\r\nmore basic dykes (specific gravity 3·02).\"\r\n\r\nIn the great majority of examples hitherto observed in Skye the two\r\nlateral dykes consist of some basic rock (diabase or basalt), while\r\nthe central and thickest band is of some acid material (granophyre or\r\nquartz-felsite). This triple arrangement occurs both in dykes and sills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 254.--Compound dyke, Market Stance, Broadford, Skye.\r\n\r\n_a_, Granophyre; _b_ _b_, Basalt; _c_ _c_, Torridon sandstone.]\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the association of the two kinds of rock in\r\ndykes I may cite an example which appears on the southern edge of the\r\nMarket Stance of Broadford (Fig. 254). Here the characteristic triple\r\narrangement is typically developed. A central light-coloured band,\r\nabout eight to ten feet broad, consists of a spherulitic granophyre\r\nin which the spherulites are crowded together and project from the\r\nweathered surface like peas, though they do not here show the curious\r\nrod-like aggregation so marked in some other dykes. On either side of\r\nthis acid centre a narrow basalt dyke intervenes as a wall next to the\r\nTorridon sandstone which here forms the country-rock. Such compound\r\ndykes have sometimes a total width of 100 feet or more.\r\n\r\nIn this instance, and generally throughout the district, there is\r\nnothing to indicate that the different bands of the dyke have any\r\nrelation to each other as connected uprises of material from the\r\nsame original magma which was either heterogeneous or was undergoing\r\na process of differentiation beneath the terrestrial crust. On the\r\ncontrary, the several parts of each dyke are as distinctly marked off\r\nfrom each other as they could have been had they been injected at\r\nwidely separated intervals of volcanic activity.\r\n\r\nMr. Harker, in the course of his survey of this Skye ground, has\r\nobserved that \"where evidence is available, the central acid dyke\r\nis found to be newer than the basic ones. It has not split a single\r\nbasic dyke, but has insinuated itself between the two members of a\r\ndouble dyke. This is more clearly seen when the acid magma has been\r\nforced into a triple or multiple basic dyke; the perfect symmetry\r\nof arrangement may in this case be lost. For instance, on the shore\r\nnorth-east of Corry, Broadford, a 13 feet dyke of granophyre occurs in\r\na multiple dyke of basalt, but it has taken its line so as to leave\r\nonly a one-foot dyke on one side, and a group with a total width of\r\n12 feet on the other. Also it has not accurately kept its course, but\r\nhas cut obliquely across one of the group of dykes alluded to. In some\r\ncases it is certain that the acid magma has to some extent dissolved a\r\nportion of the wall of a basic dyke with which it has come in contact.\r\nThis may account for the magma finding its easiest path along, and\r\nespecially between, pre-existing more basic dykes.\" This subject will\r\nbe again referred to in Chapter xlviii., when the phenomena of compound\r\nsills are discussed.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this account of compound dykes, I may remark that no\r\nexamples have yet been observed among the ordinary Tertiary dykes\r\nof Britain where, by a process of differentiation between the walls\r\nof a fissure, successive zones have been developed in the dyke,\r\ndiffering from each other in structure and composition, but becoming\r\nprogressively and insensibly more acid towards the centre, such as\r\nhave been described from the older rocks of Norway and Canada. Among\r\nthe Tertiary gabbro bosses, indeed, there occur sheets or dykes which\r\npresent a remarkably banded structure, to which full reference will be\r\nmade in later pages. But I have never seen anything at all resembling\r\nsuch a structure among the dykes of andesite, dolerite, or basalt.\r\n\r\n\r\n17. CONTACT-METAMORPHISM OF THE DYKES\r\n\r\nA geologist might naturally expect that such abundant intrusions of\r\nigneous rock as those of the dykes should be accompanied with plentiful\r\nproofs of contact-metamorphism. But in actual fact, evidence of any\r\nserious amount of alteration is singularly scarce. A slight induration\r\nof the rocks on either side of a dyke is generally all the change that\r\ncan be detected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 255.--Section of coal rendered columnar by\r\nintrusive basalt, shore, Saltcoats, Ayrshire.\r\n\r\n_a_, Fireclay; _b_, Coal rendered prismatic near the basalt; _c_, Dark\r\nshale; _d_, Basalt-rock.]\r\n\r\nSome of the larger dykes, however, show more marked metamorphism, the\r\nnature of which appears in many cases to be chiefly determined by\r\nthe chemical composition of the rock affected. Thus a considerable\r\nalteration has been superinduced on carbonaceous strata, particularly\r\non seams of coal. In the Ayrshire coal-field the alteration of the coal\r\nextends sometimes 150 feet from the dyke, the extent of the change\r\ndepending not merely on the mass of the igneous rock, but on the nature\r\nof the coal, and possibly on other causes. Close to a dyke, coal passes\r\ninto a kind of soot or cinder, sometimes assumes the form of a finely\r\ncolumnar coke (Fig. 255), and occasionally has become vesicular after\r\nbeing fused.[201] Shales are converted into a hard flinty substance that\r\nbreaks with a conchoidal fracture and rings under the hammer. Fireclay\r\nis baked into a porcelain-like material. Limestone is changed for a few\r\ninches into marble. As an illustration of this alteration, I may cite a\r\ndyke ten feet broad which cuts through the chalk in the Templepatrick\r\nQuarry, Antrim. For about six inches from the igneous rock the chalk\r\nhas passed into a finely saccharoid condition, and its organisms are\r\neffaced. But beyond that distance the crystalline structure rapidly\r\ndies away, the micro-organisms begin to make their appearance, and\r\nwithin a space of one foot from the dyke the chalk assumes its ordinary\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 201: Explanation of Sheet 22, Geological Survey of Scotland, p.\r\n26.]\r\n\r\nSandstones are indurated by dykes into a kind of quartzite, sometimes\r\nassume a columnar structure (the columns being directed away from\r\nthe dyke-walls), and for several feet or yards have their yellow or\r\nred colours bleached out of them. The granite of Ben Cruachan where\r\nquarried on Loch Awe, as I am informed by Mr. J. S. Grant Wilson, is\r\ntraversed by a basic dyke, and for a distance of about 20 feet is\r\nrendered darker in colour, becomes granular, and cannot be polished and\r\nmade saleable.\r\n\r\nWhere many dykes have been crowded together, their collective effects\r\nin the alteration of the strata traversed by them have sometimes been\r\nstrongly developed. One of the most remarkable illustrations of this\r\ninfluence is presented by the district of Strathaird, which was cited\r\nby Macculloch for the abundance of its dykes. In recently mapping\r\nthis ground for the Geological Survey, Mr. Harker has observed in\r\nsome places a score or more dykes in actual juxtaposition, while over\r\nconsiderable distances he found it difficult to detect any trace of\r\nthe Jurassic strata, through which the igneous rocks have ascended.\r\nAs might be expected under these circumstances, such portions of\r\nthe strata as can be seen display an altogether exceptional amount\r\nof contact-metamorphism. Mr. Harker has noticed some limestones at\r\nCamasunary which have been changed into very remarkable lime-silicate\r\nrocks, with singular bunches of diopside crystals.\r\n\r\nThese, however, are the extremes of contact-metamorphism by the\r\nTertiary basic dykes. A geologist visiting the Liassic shores of Strath\r\nin Skye will not fail to be surprised at the very slight degree of\r\nalteration in circumstances where he would have expected to find it\r\nstrongly pronounced. The dark shales, though ribbed across with dykes,\r\nare sometimes hardly even hardened, and at the most are only indurated\r\nfrom an inch or two to about two feet. These baked bands project above\r\nthe rest of the more easily denuded shales, and so adhere to the dykes\r\nas almost to seem part of them. Again the limestones, where traversed\r\nby dykes some distance apart, are not rendered in any appreciable\r\ndegree more crystalline even up to the very margin of the intrusive\r\nrock. Where the igneous material has been thrust between the strata\r\nin sills, it has produced far more general and serious metamorphism\r\nthan when it occurs in the form of single dykes. The famous rock of\r\nPortrush, already referred to as having been once gravely cited as an\r\nexample of fossiliferous basalt, is a good illustration of the way in\r\nwhich Lias shale is porcellanized when the intruded igneous material\r\nhas been thrust between the planes of bedding.\r\n\r\nIn the West of Scotland, where dykes are so abundantly developed,\r\nconsiderable differences can be observed between the amount of\r\nmetamorphism superinduced by adjacent dykes which may be of the same\r\nthickness, and cut through the same kind of strata. Such variations\r\nhave not probably arisen from differences in the temperature of the\r\noriginal molten rock. Perhaps they are rather to be assigned to the\r\nlength of time occupied by the ascent of the lava in the fissure.\r\nIf, for instance, the fissure opened to the surface and discharged\r\nlava there, the rocks of its walls would be exposed to a continuous\r\nstream of molten rock as long as the outflow lasted. They would thus\r\nhave their temperature more highly raised, and maintained at such an\r\nelevation for a longer time than where the magma, at once arrested\r\nwithin the fissure, immediately proceeded to cool and consolidate\r\nthere. It would be an interesting and important conclusion if we could,\r\nfrom the nature or amount of their contact-metamorphism, distinguish\r\nthose dykes which for some time served as channels for the discharge of\r\nlava above ground.\r\n\r\nSome dykes which have caught up fragments of older rocks in their\r\nascent have exercised a considerable solvent action on these\r\ninclusions. Examples of this feature have already been cited from Skye,\r\nwhere they have been studied by Mr. Harker (pp. 129, 163).\r\n\r\nIn connection with the metamorphism superinduced by dykes, reference\r\nmay again be made to the alteration which they themselves undergo\r\nwhere they have invaded a carbonaceous shale or coal. The igneous\r\nrock, as we have seen, loses its dark colour and obviously crystalline\r\nstructure, and becomes a pale yellow or white, dull, earthy substance,\r\nor \"white trap.\" The chemical changes involved in this alteration\r\nhave been described by Sir J. Lowthian Bell.[202] Dr. Stecher has also\r\ndiscussed the alterations traceable by the aid of the microscope.[203]\r\nThough most of the instances of such transformation in Britain occur\r\nin the Carboniferous system, and have taken place in intrusive rocks\r\nof probably, for the most part, Carboniferous or Permian age, yet they\r\nare not unknown in the Tertiary volcanic series. Some of the \"white\r\ntrap\" of the Coal-measures may indeed belong to the Tertiary period,\r\nbut the coals and carbonaceous shales interstratified in the Tertiary\r\nbasalt-plateaux have reacted on both the superficial lavas and the\r\nsills, and have given rise to the same kind of alteration as in the\r\nCarboniferous system, as will be shown in a later Chapter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: _Proc. Roy. Soc._ xxiii. (1875), p. 543.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 203: Tschermak's _Mineralogische Mittheilungen_, ix. (1887), p.\r\n145, and _Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin._ 1888.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 256.--Dolerite dyke with marginal bands of \"white trap,\" in\r\n  black shale, Lower Lias, Pabba.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Black carbonaceous Lower Lias Shale; _b_ _b_, bands of\r\n  indurated shale from 15 inches to 2 feet broad; _c_, dolerite dyke\r\n  3 feet 3 inches broad; _d_ _d_, bands of altered dolerite or \"white\r\n  trap,\" 3 to 5 inches broad.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSome marked examples of this alteration of intrusive igneous material\r\nare to be observed among the basalt dykes which cut the Lower Lias\r\nShales of Skye. These shales, where black and carbonaceous, as in\r\nthe island of Pabba, have exercised an unmistakable influence on the\r\nabundant dykes which intersect them. The chilled selvage of each dyke\r\nhas assumed the dull earthy pale-grey or yellowish aspect, which\r\nextends for a few inches from the wall into the interior, where it\r\nrapidly passes into the ordinary black crystalline basalt. These\r\nfeatures will be readily understood from the accompanying diagram (Fig.\r\n256). Where the dykes give off narrow veins a few inches broad, these\r\nconsist entirely of the \"white trap.\" The shales are often traversed\r\nwith strong joints parallel to the walls of the dykes, and the\r\ntransverse joints of the dykes are sometimes prolonged into the bands\r\nof indurated shale.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. RELATION OF DYKES TO THE GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF THE DISTRICTS\r\nWHICH THEY TRAVERSE.\r\n\r\nIn no respect do the Tertiary dykes of Britain stand more distinguished\r\nfrom all the other rocks of the country than in their extraordinary\r\nindependence of geological structure. The successive groups of\r\nPalæozoic and Mesozoic strata have been so tilted as to follow each\r\nother in approximately parallel bands, which run obliquely across the\r\nisland from south-west to north-east. The most important lines of fault\r\ntake the same general line. The contemporaneously included igneous\r\nrocks follow, of course, the trend of the stratified deposits among\r\nwhich they lie, and even the intrusive sills group themselves along the\r\ngeneral strike of the whole country. But the Tertiary dykes have their\r\nown independent direction, to which they adhere amid the extremest\r\ndiversities of geological arrangement.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the dykes intersect nearly the whole range of the\r\ngeological formations of the British Islands. In the Outer Hebrides and\r\nnorth-west Highlands, they rise through the most ancient (Lewisian)\r\ngneisses, through the red pre-Cambrian (Torridon) sandstones, and\r\nthrough the oldest members of the Cambrian system. In the southern\r\nHighlands, they pursue their course across the gnarled and twisted\r\nschists of the younger crystalline (Dalradian) series. In the South of\r\nScotland and North of England, they traverse the various subdivisions\r\nof the Lower and Upper Silurian rocks. In the basins of the Tay, Forth,\r\nand Clyde they cross the plains and ridges of the Old Red Sandstone,\r\nwith its deep pile of intercalated volcanic material. In Central\r\nScotland, and the northern English counties, they occur abundantly in\r\nthe Carboniferous system, and have destroyed the seams of coal. In\r\nCumberland and Durham, they traverse the Permian and Trias groups.\r\nIn Yorkshire, and along the West of Scotland, they are found running\r\nthrough Jurassic strata. In Antrim, they intersect the Chalk. Both in\r\nthe North of Ireland, and all through the chain of the Inner Hebrides,\r\nthey abound in the great sheets and bosses of Tertiary volcanic rocks.\r\nThese are the youngest formations through which they rise. But it is\r\ndeserving of note, that they intersect every great group of these\r\nTertiary volcanic products, so that they include in their number the\r\nlatest known manifestations of eruptive action in the geological\r\nhistory of Britain.[204]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 204: They have not been found cutting the pitchstone-lava of\r\nthe Scuir of Eigg.]\r\n\r\nIn the second place, in ranging across groups of rock belonging to\r\nsuch widely diverse periods, the dykes must necessarily often pass\r\nabruptly from one kind of material and geological structure to another.\r\nBut, as a rule, they do so without any sensible deviation from their\r\nusual trend, or any alteration of their average width. Here and there,\r\nindeed, we may observe a dyke to follow a more wavy or more rapidly\r\nsinuous or zig-zag course in one group of rocks than in another.\r\nYet, so far as I have myself been able to observe, such sinuosities\r\nmay occur in almost any kind of material, and are not satisfactorily\r\nexplicable by any difference of texture or arrangement in the rocks\r\nat the surface. No dyke traverses a greater variety of sedimentary\r\nformations than that of Cleveland. In the eastern part of its course,\r\nit rises through all the Mesozoic groups up to the Cornbrash. Further\r\nwest it cuts across each of the different subdivisions of the\r\nCarboniferous system; and, of course, it must traverse all the older\r\nformations which underlie these. But the occasional rapid changes\r\nnoticeable in its width and direction do not seem to be referable to\r\nany corresponding structure in the surrounding rocks. The Cheviot\r\ndyke crosses from the Carboniferous area of Northumberland into the\r\nUpper Silurian rocks and Lower Old Red Sandstone volcanic tract of\r\nthe Cheviot Hills. It then strikes across the Upper Old Red Sandstone\r\nof Roxburghshire, and still maintaining the same persistent trend,\r\nsweeps westward into the intensely plicated Silurian rocks of the\r\nSouthern Uplands. Its occasional deviations have no obvious reference\r\nto any visible change of structure in the adjacent formations. Again,\r\nsome of the great dykes at the head of Clydesdale furnish striking\r\nillustrations of entire indifference to the nature of the rock through\r\nwhich they run. Quitting the Silurian uplands, they keep their line\r\nacross Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous rocks, and through large\r\nmasses of eruptive material.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, not only are the dykes not deflected by great\r\ndiversities in the lithological character of the rocks which they\r\ntraverse, they even cross without deviation some of the most important\r\ngeological features in the general framework of the country. Some\r\nof the Scottish examples are singularly impressive in this respect.\r\nThose which strike north-westward from the uplands of Clydesdale\r\ncross without deflection the great boundary-fault which, by a throw\r\nof several thousand feet, brings the Lower Old Red Sandstone against\r\nSilurian rocks. They traverse some large faults in the valley of the\r\nDouglas coal-field, pass completely across the axis of the Haughshaw\r\nHills, where the Upper Silurian rocks are once more brought up to the\r\nsurface, and also the long felsite ridge of Priesthill. The dykes in\r\nthe centre of the kingdom maintain their line across some of the large\r\nmasses of igneous rock that protrude through the Carboniferous system.\r\nFurther north, the dykes of Perthshire cut across the great sheets of\r\nvolcanic material that form the Ochil Hills, as well as through the\r\npiles of sandstone and conglomerate of the Lower Old Red Sandstone, and\r\nthen go right across the boundary-fault of the Highlands, to pursue\r\ntheir way in the same independent manner through grit, quartzite, or\r\nmica-schist, and across glen and lake, moor and mountain.\r\n\r\nNo one can contemplate these repeated examples of an entire want of\r\nconnection between the dykes and the nature and arrangement of the\r\nrocks which they traverse without being convinced that the lines of\r\nrent up which the material of the dykes rose were not, as a rule, old\r\nfractures in the earth's crust, but were fresh fissures, opened across\r\nthe course of the older dislocations and strike of the country by the\r\nsame series of subterranean operations to which the uprise of the\r\nmolten material of the dykes was also due.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth place, the dykes for the most part are not coincident\r\nwith visible lines of fault. After the examination of hundreds of dykes\r\nin all parts of the country, and with all the help which bare hillsides\r\nand well-exposed coast-sections can afford, the number of instances\r\nwhich have been met with where dykes have availed themselves of lines\r\nof fault is surprisingly small. Some of these cases will be immediately\r\ncited. To whatever cause we may ascribe the rupture of the solid crust\r\nof the earth, which admitted the rise of molten rock to form the dykes,\r\nthere can be no doubt that it was not generally attended with that\r\ndisplacement of level on one or both sides of the dislocation, which\r\nwe associate with the idea of a fault. Nowhere can this important part\r\nof dyke-structure be more clearly illustrated than along the Cleveland\r\ndyke, where the igneous rock rises through almost horizontal Jurassic\r\nstrata and gently inclined Coal-measures (Figs. 241, 242, 243, 244).\r\nBesides the localities already cited, mining operations both for coal\r\nand for the Liassic ironstone have proved over a wide area that the\r\ndyke has not risen along a line of fault. Again, in Skye, Raasay,\r\nEigg, and other parts of the west coast, where Jurassic strata and\r\nthe horizontal basalts of the plateaux are plentifully cut through by\r\ndykes, the same beds may generally be seen at the same level on either\r\nside of them.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth place, while complete indifference to geological structure\r\nis the general rule among the dykes, instances do occur in which the\r\nmolten material has found its way upward along old lines of rupture.\r\nMost of such instances are to be found in districts where previously\r\nexisting faults happened to run in the same general direction as that\r\nfollowed by the dykes. These lines of fracture might naturally be\r\nre-opened by any great earth-movements acting in their direction, and\r\nwould afford ready channels for the ascent of the lava, as we have seen\r\nto have not infrequently happened in the case of dyke-fissures, which\r\nare shown by compound dykes to have sometimes been re-opened several\r\ntimes in succession even after having been filled up with basalt. Yet\r\nit is curious that, even when their trend would have suited the line\r\nof the dykes, faults have not been more largely made use of for the\r\npurpose of relief. Some of the best examples of the coincidence of\r\ndykes with pre-existing faults in the same direction are to be found\r\nin the Stirlingshire coal-field. The dyke that runs from Torphichen\r\nfor 23 miles to Cadder occupies a line of fault which at Slamannan has\r\na down-throw of more than 70 fathoms. The next dyke further south has\r\nalso risen along an east and west fault.\r\n\r\nBut other examples may be observed where pre-existing fissures have\r\nserved to deflect dykes from their usual line of trend. Thus the\r\nCleveland dyke, after crossing several faults in the Coal-measures, at\r\nlast encounters one near Cockfield Fell, which lies obliquely across\r\nits path. Instead of crossing this fault it bends sharply round a few\r\npoints south of west, and after keeping along the southern flank of\r\nthe fault for about a mile, sinks out of reach. Some of the Scottish\r\nexamples are more remarkable. One of the best of them occurs in the\r\nSanquhar coal-field, where a dyke runs for two miles and a half along\r\nthe large fault that here brings down the Coal-measures against the\r\nLower Silurian rocks. At the north-western end of the basin, this fault\r\nmakes an abrupt bend of 60° to W.S.W., and the dyke turns round with\r\nit, keeping this altered course for a mile and a half, when it strikes\r\naway from the fault, crosses a narrow belt of Lower Silurian rocks,\r\nand finds its way into the parallel boundary fault which defines the\r\nnorth-western margin of the Southern Uplands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 257.--Map of the chief dykes between Lochs Riddon\r\nand Striven (C. T. Clough, Geological Survey, Sheet 29). The large E.\r\nand W. dyke is a continuation of that which reaches the shore of the\r\nFirth of Clyde at Dunoon.]\r\n\r\nSome of the Perthshire dykes, where they reach the great boundary-fault\r\nof the Highlands, present specially interesting features. There can\r\nbe no doubt that this dislocation is one of the most important in the\r\ngeneral framework of the British Isles, though no definite estimate has\r\nyet been formed of how much rock has been actually displaced by it. The\r\nfact that in one place the beds of Old Red Sandstone are thrown on end\r\nfor some two miles back from it, shows that it must be a very powerful\r\nfracture. Here, therefore, if anywhere, either an entire cessation of\r\nthe dykes, or at least a complete deflection of their course might be\r\nanticipated. It would require, we might suppose, a singularly potent\r\ndislocation to open a way for the ascent of the lava through such\r\ncrushed and compressed rocks, and still more to prolong the general\r\nline of a fracture across the old fault. Two great dykes, about half a\r\nmile apart, run in a direction a little south of west across the plain\r\nof Strathearn. Passing to the south of the village of Crieff, they hold\r\non their way until they reach the highly-inclined beds of sandstone\r\nand conglomerate which here lean against the Highland fault in Glen\r\nArtney. They then turn round towards south-west, and run up the glen\r\nalong the strike of the beds, keeping approximately parallel to the\r\nfault for about three miles, when they both strike across the fault,\r\nand pursue a W.S.W. line through the contorted crystalline rocks of\r\nthe Highlands. About two miles further south, another dyke continues\r\nits normal course across the belt of upturned Old Red Sandstone; but\r\nwhen it reaches the fault it bends round and follows the line of\r\ndislocation, sometimes coinciding with, sometimes crossing or running\r\nparallel with that line, at a short distance (see Fig. 247).\r\n\r\nSome remarkable examples have been mapped by Mr. Clough in Eastern\r\nArgyleshire, where broad bands of basalt or other allied rock run in a\r\nN. and S. direction, and are formed by the confluence of N.W and S.E.\r\nor N.N.W. and S.S.E. dykes, where these are drawn into a line of fault\r\n(Fig. 257). These broad bands, he has found to be not usually traceable\r\nfor more than a mile or so, for the dykes of which they are made up\r\nwill not be diverted from their regular paths for more than a certain\r\ndistance, so that one by one the dykes leave the compound band to\r\npursue their normal course. He has observed that the occasional great\r\nthickness of these compound bands depends partly on the size and partly\r\non the number of separate dykes that are diverted into the line of\r\ntransverse fissure; for, where the fissure crosses an area with fewer\r\nnorth-west dykes, the band becomes thinner or ceases altogether.\r\n\r\nIn some rare cases, the dykes have been shifted by more recent faults.\r\nI shall have occasion to show that faults of more than 1000 feet have\r\ntaken place since the Tertiary basalt-plateaux were formed. There is\r\ntherefore no reason why here and there a fault with a low hade should\r\nnot have shifted the outcrop of a dyke. But the fact remains, that,\r\nas a general rule, the dykes run independently of faults even where\r\nthey approach close to them. Mr. Clough has observed some interesting\r\ncases in South-eastern Argyleshire, where the apparent shifting of\r\na dyke by faults proves to be deceptive, and where the dyke has for\r\nshort distances merely availed itself of old lines of fracture. One\r\nof the most remarkable of these is presented by the large dyke which\r\nruns westward from Dunoon. No fewer than three times, in the course of\r\nfour miles between Lochs Striven and Riddon, does this dyke make sharp\r\nchanges of trend nearly at right angles to its usual direction, where\r\nit encounters north and south faults (Fig. 257). It would be natural to\r\nconclude that these changes are actual dislocations due to the faults.\r\nBut the careful observer just cited has been able to trace the dyke in\r\na very attenuated and uncrushed form along some of these cross faults,\r\nand thus to prove that the faults are of older date, but that they\r\nhave modified the line of the long east and west fissure up which the\r\nmaterial of the dyke ascended.\r\n\r\n\r\n19. DATA FOR ESTIMATING THE GEOLOGICAL AGE OF THE DYKES\r\n\r\nI have already assigned reasons for regarding the system of north-west\r\nand south-east or east and west dykes as belonging to the Tertiary\r\nvolcanic period in the geographical history of the British Islands.\r\nBut I have no evidence that they were restricted to any part of that\r\nperiod. On the contrary, there is every reason to consider the uprise\r\nof the earliest and latest dykes to have been separated by a protracted\r\ninterval. That they do not all belong to one epoch has been already\r\nindicated, and may now be more specially proved.\r\n\r\nThe intersection of one dyke by another furnishes an obvious criterion\r\nof relative age. Macculloch drew attention to this test, and stated\r\nthat it had enabled him to make out two distinct sets of dykes in Skye\r\nand Rum. But he confessed that it failed to afford any information as\r\nto the length of the interval of time between them.[205] It is not always\r\nso easy as might be thought to make sure which of two intersecting\r\ndykes is the older. As was explained in Chapter vi. (vol. i. p. 81),\r\nwe have to look for the finer-grained marginal strip at the edge of a\r\ndyke, which, where traceable across another dyke, marks at once their\r\nrelative age. The cross joints of the two dykes also run in different\r\ndirections. Reference may again be made to the illustration given in\r\nFig. 253 where three distinct groups of dykes intersect each other as\r\nthey traverse the Lias limestones of Skye. The chilled edges and the\r\ndifferent arrangement of joints mark these dykes out from each other,\r\nwhile the order in which they cross each other furnishes a clue to\r\ntheir relative age. If from such sections, repeated in different parts\r\nof a district, certain persistent petrographical characters can be\r\nascertained to distinguish each particular system of dykes, a guide may\r\nthereby be obtained for the chronological grouping of the intrusions\r\neven where evidence of actual intersection is not visible. In the case\r\njust cited from Skye, the later north and south dykes are characterized\r\nby their lines of vesicular cavities and by the large porphyritic\r\nfelspars which they contain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 205: _Trans. Geol. Soc._ iii. p. 75.]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, however, that although sections of this kind suffice to\r\nprove the dykes to belong to distinct periods of intrusion, no longer\r\ninterval need have elapsed between their successive production than was\r\nrequired for the solidification and assumption of a joint-structure by\r\nan older dyke before a younger broke through it. They may both belong\r\nto one brief period of volcanic activity. But when we pass to a series\r\nof dykes traversing a considerable district of country, and find that\r\nthose which run in one direction are invariably cut by those which\r\nrun in another, the inference can hardly be resisted that they do not\r\nbelong to the same period of eruption, but mark successive epochs of\r\nvolcanic energy. An excellent example of this kind of evidence is\r\nfurnished by Mr. Clough from Eastern Argyleshire. The east and west\r\ndykes in that district are undoubtedly older than those which run\r\nin a N.N.W. direction (Fig. 257).[206] The latter are by far the most\r\nabundant, and are on the whole much narrower, less persistent, and\r\nfiner in grain. On the opposite coast of the Clyde, a similar double\r\nset of dykes may be traced through Renfrewshire, those in an east and\r\nwest direction being comparatively few, while the younger N.N.W. series\r\nis well developed. The great sheets or \"sills\" connected with one of\r\nthe Stirlingshire dykes, already described, appear to me to furnish\r\nsimilar evidence in the younger dykes which run through them. And this\r\nevidence is peculiarly valuable, for it shows a succession even among\r\nadjacent dykes which all run in the same general direction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 206: As already stated, Mr. Clough and also Mr. Gunn are\r\ninclined to separate these older east and west dykes from the Tertiary\r\nseries and to regard them as probably of late Palæozoic age.]\r\n\r\nBut in all these cases it is obvious that we have little indication of\r\nthe length of time that intervened between the successive injections\r\nof the dykes. In Skye, however, more definite evidence presents itself\r\nthat the interval must have been in some cases a protracted one.\r\nAs far back as the year 1857,[207] I showed that the basic dykes of\r\nStrath in Skye are of two ages; that one set was erupted before the\r\nappearance of the \"syenite\" (granophyre) of that district, and was cut\r\noff by the latter rock; and that the other arose after the \"syenite\"\r\nwhich it intersected. Recent re-examination has enabled me to confirm\r\nand extend this observation. The younger series which traverses the\r\ngranophyre is much less numerous than the older series in the same\r\ndistricts. In Chapter xlvi., where the relations of the granophyres\r\nto other members of the volcanic series will be discussed, further\r\ndetails will be given from that region of Skye to demonstrate that\r\nthere is a pre-granophyre and a post-granophyre series of basic dykes.\r\nAs a good illustration of the younger series I may refer to the way\r\nin which these rocks make their appearance in the island group of St.\r\nKilda, where both the gabbros and granophyres of the Tertiary volcanic\r\nseries are characteristically developed. Numerous dykes traverse both\r\nthese rocks. Those in the gabbro are more abundant than those in the\r\ngranophyre--a circumstance which is exactly paralleled among the basic\r\nand acid bosses of Skye. It is not improbable that in these remote\r\nislands a similar difference in age and in petrographical character\r\nmay be made out between two series of dykes, one older and the other\r\nyounger than the granophyre. There is ample proof, at all events, of a\r\npost-granophyre series.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 207: _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ vol. xiv. p. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 258.--Basalt-veins traversing granophyre, St.\r\nKilda.]\r\n\r\nThe pale colour of the precipices in which the St. Kilda granophyre\r\nplunges into the sea gives special prominence to the dark ribbon-like\r\nstreaks which mark the course of basalt-dykes through that rock.\r\nMoreover the greater liability of the material of the dykes to decay\r\ncauses them to weather into long lines of notch or recess. Four or five\r\nsuch dykes follow each other in nearly parallel bands, which slant\r\nupward from the sea-level on the eastern face of the hill Conacher to a\r\nheight of several hundred feet.[208] (Fig. 258, see also Fig. 367.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 208: This relation of the later dykes to the granophyre was\r\nobserved here by Macculloch (_Western Isles_, vol. ii. p. 55).]\r\n\r\nThe acid eruptions of the Inner Hebrides are marked by so varied a\r\nseries of rocks, and so complex a geological structure, that they may,\r\nwith some confidence, be regarded as having occupied a considerable\r\ninterval of geological time. Yet we find that this prolonged episode\r\nin the volcanic history was both preceded and followed by the\r\nextravasation of basic dykes.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to recent observations by Mr. Harker,\r\nwho, in mapping the Strath district of Skye for the Geological Survey,\r\nhas not only confirmed the generalization as to the existence of a\r\nseries of dykes earlier, and another later, than the great granophyre\r\nprotrusions of the Inner Hebrides, but has made some progress towards\r\nthe detection of a means of distinguishing the two series even where no\r\ndirect test of their relative age may be available. He thinks that the\r\ngeneral habit and petrographical characters of the dykes may on further\r\ninvestigation be found to afford a sufficiently reliable basis for\r\ndiscrimination. He finds that where the relative ages of the dykes with\r\nreference to the granophyre can be fixed, the earlier or pre-granophyre\r\nseries is without exception basic. It consists of fine-textured basalts\r\nor diabases, without any conspicuous porphyritic crystals. Its dykes\r\nare less regular and persistent in their bearing than those of the\r\nlater series; have frequently a considerable hade, even as much as 45°,\r\nand often show chilled edges with tachylitic selvages. In Skye many of\r\nthese earlier dykes may be connected with the gabbro. They appear to\r\nbe more basic and to have a higher specific gravity than those of the\r\nlater series which most resemble them.\r\n\r\nThe later or post-granophyre dykes include several types, the relative\r\nages of which are not yet definitely fixed. They run in straight\r\nparallel lines, and thus seldom intersect each other. They are\r\ngenerally vertical or highly inclined, and are much more frequently\r\ncharacterized by amygdaloiclal structure than the earlier series.\r\nMr. Harker distinguishes the following varieties among them: (_a_)\r\nQuartz-felsites and other acid rocks; these are not very common.\r\n(_b_) Pitchstones and various spherulitic and variolitic rocks: the\r\nactual pitchstones observed are comparatively few in number, but it is\r\ncertain that some of spherulitic varieties are devitrified pitchstones.\r\n(_c_) Basic rocks, not conspicuously porphyritic and less decidedly\r\nbasic than the dykes of the pre-granophyre series; most of the later\r\ngroups come into this or the next group, (_d_) Porphyritic basic dykes\r\nnot infrequently carrying inclusions of gabbro, granophyre or other\r\nrocks. The porphyritic felspars seem to be in great part of foreign\r\nderivation, and the same is certainly true of the augite which\r\noccasionally accompanies them and of the quartz that appears in some\r\nexamples.[209]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 209: Annual Report of the Director-General of the Geological\r\nSurvey in Report of Science and Art Department for 1895.]\r\n\r\nIn the Carlingford district of the North-east of Ireland, similar\r\nevidence has been obtained that one series of dykes preceded and\r\nanother followed the protrusion of the granites and granophyre which\r\nare in all probability geologically coeval with the acid bosses of the\r\nInner Hebrides. The distinction was observed and mapped by Mr. Traill\r\nfor the Geological Survey. Professor Sollas in recently confirming\r\nthese observations has not noticed any striking difference between the\r\npre-granite and post-granite dykes, the whole appearing to consist of\r\nthe same coarsely porphyritic material.[210]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210: See Sheets 59, 60, and 71 of the Geological Survey Map of\r\nIreland; Professor Sollas, _Trans. Roy. Irish Acad._ vol. xxx. (1894),\r\np. 477; and Annual Report of the Director-General of the Geological\r\nSurvey for 1895.]\r\n\r\nWhile the eruption of the granophyre bosses furnishes proof that the\r\ndykes are not all of the same age, other evidence may be gathered\r\nto show how much older some of the dykes are than the youngest\r\nlava-streams in the volcanic history of Tertiary time in Britain.\r\nThe Scuir of Eigg, to which fuller reference will be made in Chapter\r\nxxxviii., is formed of a mass of pitchstone, which has filled up an\r\nancient valley eroded out of the terraced basalts of the plateaux. At\r\nboth ends of the ridge, these basalts are seen to be traversed by dykes\r\nthat are abruptly cut off by the shingle of the old river-bed which\r\nthe pitchstone has occupied (Figs. 279, 282). It is thus evident that,\r\nthough these dykes are younger than the plateau-basalts, they are much\r\nolder than the excavation of the valley out of these basalts, and still\r\nolder than the eruption of pitchstone. The latter rock probably belongs\r\nto the close of the period of lava-eruptions. The enormous denudation\r\nof the basalt-plateaux after the injection of the dykes and before the\r\noutflow of the pitchstone affords a convincing proof of the vastness of\r\nthe interval between the eruption of the two kinds of rock.[211]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 211: _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ xiv. p. 1.]\r\n\r\nIt is thus demonstrable that the dykes which in Britain form part of\r\nthe great Tertiary volcanic series, were not all produced at one epoch,\r\nbut belong to at least two (and probably to many more) episodes in one\r\nlong volcanic history. As they rise through every member of that series\r\nof rocks (save the pitchstones), some of them must be among the latest\r\nrecords of the prolonged volcanic activity. But, on the other hand,\r\nsome probably go back to the very beginning of the Tertiary volcanic\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n20. ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE DYKES\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the doubt expressed by Macculloch\r\nwhether the dykes in Skye had been filled in from above or from below.\r\nThat the dykes of the country as a whole were supplied from above,\r\nwas the view entertained and enforced by Boué. He introduces the\r\nsubject with the following remarks:--\"Scotland is renowned for the\r\nnumber of its basaltic veins, which gave Hutton his ideas regarding\r\nthe injection of lava from below; but, as the greatest genius is not\r\ninfallible, and as volcanic countries present us with examples of such\r\nveins arising evidently from accidental fissures that were filled\r\nup by currents of lava which moved over them, and as the Scottish\r\ninstances are of the same kind, we regard it as infinitely probable\r\nthat all these veins have been formed in the same way notwithstanding\r\nthe enormous denudation which this supposition involves; and that only\r\nrarely do cases occur where they have been filled laterally or in some\r\nother irregular manner.\"[212] I need not say that this view, which,\r\nexcept among Wernerians, had never many supporters, has long ago been\r\nabandoned and forgotten. There is no further question that the molten\r\nmaterial came from below.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: _Essai Géologique sur l'Écosse_, p. 272.]\r\n\r\n1. In discussing the history of the dykes, we are first confronted\r\nwith the problem of the formation of the fissures up which the molten\r\nmaterial rose. From what has been said above regarding the usual want\r\nof relation between dykes and the nature and arrangements of the rocks\r\nwhich they traverse, it is, I think, manifest that the fissures could\r\nnot have been caused by any superficial action, such as that which\r\nproduces cracks of the ground during earthquake-shocks. The fact that\r\nthey traverse rocks of the most extreme diversities of elasticity,\r\nstructure, and resistance, and yet maintain the same persistent trend\r\nthrough them all, shows that they originated far below the limits to\r\nwhich the known rocks of the surface descend. We have seen that in the\r\ncase of the Cleveland dyke, the fissure can be proved to be at least\r\nsome three miles deep. But the seat of the origin of the rents no doubt\r\nlay much deeper down within the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nIt is also evident that the cause which gave rise to these abundant\r\nfissures must have been quite distinct from the movements that produced\r\nthe prevalent strike and the main faults of this country. From early\r\ngeological time, as is well known, the movements of the earth's crust\r\nbeneath the area of Britain, have been directed in such a manner as\r\nto give the different stratified formations a general north-east and\r\nsouth-west strike, and to dislocate them by great faults with the same\r\naverage trend. But the fissures of the Tertiary dykes run obliquely\r\nand even at a right angle across this prevalent older series of lines\r\nand are distinct from any other architectonic feature in the geology\r\nof the country. They did not arise therefore by a mere renewal of some\r\nprevious order of disturbances, but were brought about by a new set of\r\nmovements to which it is difficult to find any parallel in the earlier\r\nrecords of the region.[213]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: The only other known example of such a dyke-structure in\r\nBritain is that of the Pre-Cambrian series of dykes in the Lewisian\r\ngneiss of Sutherland, described in Chapter viii.]\r\n\r\nWe have further to remember that the fissures were not produced merely\r\nby one great disturbance. The evidence of the dykes proves beyond\r\nquestion that some of them are earlier than others, and hence that\r\nthe cause to which the fissures owed their origin came into operation\r\nrepeatedly during the protracted Tertiary volcanic period. One of\r\nthe most instructive lessons in this respect is furnished by the huge\r\neruptive masses of gabbro and granitoid rocks in Skye. These materials\r\nhave been erupted through the plateau-basalts. The granitoid bosses\r\nare the younger protrusions, for they send veins into the gabbros;\r\nbut their appearance was later than that of some of the dykes and\r\nolder than that of others. Nevertheless, the youngest dykes generally\r\nmaintain the usual north-westerly trend across the thickest masses of\r\nthe granophyre. Thus we perceive that, even after the extrusion of\r\nthousands of feet of such solid crystalline igneous rocks, covering\r\nareas of many square miles, the fissuring of the ground was renewed,\r\nand rents were opened through these new piles of material. From the\r\nevidence of the dykes also we learn that some fissures were repeatedly\r\nre-opened and admitted a new ascent of molten magma between their\r\nwalls. The general direction of the fissures remained from first to\r\nlast tolerably uniform. Here and there indeed, where one set of dykes\r\ntraverses another, as in Skye and the basin of the Clyde, we meet with\r\nproofs of a deviation from the normal trend. But it is remarkable that\r\ndykes which pierce the latest eruptive bosses of the Inner Hebrides\r\nrose in fissures that were opened in the normal north-westerly line\r\nthrough these great protrusions of basic and acid rock.\r\n\r\nSuch a gigantic system of parallel fissures points to great horizontal\r\ntension of the terrestrial crust over the area in which they are\r\ndeveloped. Hopkins, many years ago, discussed from the mathematical\r\nside the cause of the production of such fissures.[214] He assumed the\r\nexistence of some elevatory force acting under considerable areas\r\nof the earth's crust at any assignable depth, either with uniform\r\nintensity at every point or with a somewhat greater intensity at\r\nparticular points. He did not assign to this force any definite origin,\r\nbut supposed it \"to act upon the lower surface of the uplifted mass\r\nthrough the medium of some fluid, which may be conceived to be an\r\nelastic vapour, or, in other cases, a mass of matter in a state of\r\nfusion from heat.\"[215] He showed that such an upheaving force would\r\nproduce in the affected territory a system of parallel longitudinal\r\nfissures, which, when not far distant from each other, could only have\r\nbeen formed simultaneously, and not successively; that each fissure\r\nwould begin not at the surface but at some depth below it, and would\r\nbe propagated with great velocity; that there would be more fissures\r\nat greater than at lesser depths, many of them never reaching the\r\nsurface; that they would be of approximately uniform width, the mean\r\nwidth tending to increase downwards; that continued elevation might\r\nincrease these fissures, but that new fissures in the same direction\r\nwould not arise in the separated blocks which would now be more or less\r\nindependent of each other; that subsequent subsidences would give rise\r\nto transverse fissures, and by allowing the separated blocks to settle\r\ndown would cause irregularities in the width of the great parallel\r\nfissures. He considered also the problem presented by those cases where\r\nthe ruptures of the terrestrial crust have been filled with igneous\r\nmatter, and now appear as dykes. \"The results above obtained,\" he\r\nsays, \"will manifestly hold equally, whether we suppose the uplifted\r\nmass acted upon immediately through the medium of an elastic vapour\r\nor by matter in a state of fusion in immediate contact with its\r\nlower surface. In the latter case, however, this fused matter will\r\nnecessarily ascend into the fissures, and if maintained there till it\r\ncools and solidifies, will present such phenomena as we now recognize\r\nin dykes and veins of trap.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: _Cambridge Phil. Trans._ vi. (1835), p. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: _Ibid._ p. 10.]\r\n\r\nThe existence of a vast lake or reservoir of molten rock under the\r\nfissure-region of Britain is demonstrated by the dykes. But, if we\r\ninquire further what terrestrial operation led to the uprise of so vast\r\na body of lava towards the surface in older Tertiary time, we find that\r\nas yet no satisfactory answer can be given.\r\n\r\n2. In some districts the dykes can be connected with the gabbros which\r\noccur as intrusive sills and irregular bosses in the basalt-plateaux\r\nand among older rocks. The gabbros, however, are traversed by still\r\nlater dykes, which must then be independent of any visible mass of\r\nthese rocks. The connection of dykes with the gabbros is what we\r\nmight naturally expect to find, if the more coarsely crystalline rock\r\nrepresents portions of the basic magma which consolidated at some\r\ndepth below the surface. If we could penetrate deep enough, it is not\r\nimprobable that the dykes might be found in large measure to shade\r\ndownward into vast bodies of gabbro. Such a relation has been observed\r\nin the Yellowstone district, where Mr. Iddings has noticed that the\r\ncentre toward which the dykes of the Old Crandale volcano converge is a\r\nlarge mass of granular gabbro, passing into diorite, the dykes becoming\r\nrapidly coarser in grain as they approach the gabbro-core.[216]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: _Journ. Geol._ i. (1893), p. 608.]\r\n\r\n3. The rise of molten rock in thousands of fissures over so wide a\r\nregion is to my mind by far the most wonderful feature in the history\r\nof volcanic action in Britain. The great plateaux of basalt, and the\r\nmountainous bosses of rock by which they have been disrupted, are\r\nundoubtedly the most obvious memorials of Tertiary volcanism. But,\r\nafter all, they are merely fragments restricted to limited districts.\r\nThe dykes, however, reveal to us the extraordinary fact that, at a\r\nperiod so recent as older Tertiary time, there lay underneath the area\r\nof Britain a reservoir or series of reservoirs of lava, the united\r\nextent of which must have exceeded 40,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nThat the material of the dykes rose in general directly from below, and\r\nwas not, except locally, injected laterally along the open fissures,\r\nmay be inferred, although proof of such lateral injection on a small\r\nscale may here and there be detected. The narrowness of the rents, and\r\ntheir enormous relative length, make it physically impossible that\r\nmolten rock could have moved along them for more than short distances.\r\nThe usual homogeneous character of the dyke-rocks, the remarkable\r\nscarcity of any broken-up consolidated fragments of them immersed in\r\na matrix of different grain, the general uniformity of composition\r\nand structure from one end of a long dyke to another, the spherical\r\nform of the amygdales, the usual paucity of fragments from the fissure\r\nwalls--all point to a quiet welling of the lava upward. Over the whole\r\nof the region traversed by the dykes, from the hills of Yorkshire and\r\nLancashire to the remotest Hebrides, molten rock must have lain at a\r\ndepth, which, in one case, we know to have exceeded three miles, and\r\nwhich was probably everywhere considerably greater than that limit.\r\n\r\nForced upwards, partly perhaps by pressure due to terrestrial\r\ncontraction and partly by the enormous expansive force of the gases\r\nand vapours absorbed within it, the lava rose in thousands of fissures\r\nthat had been opened for it in the solid overlying crust. That in\r\nmost cases its ascent terminated short of the surface of the ground\r\nmay reasonably be inferred. At least, we know, that many dykes do\r\nnot reach the present surface, and that those which do have shared\r\nin the enormous denudation of the surrounding country. That even in\r\nthe same dyke the lava rose hundreds of feet higher at one place than\r\nat another is abundantly proved. When, however, we consider the vast\r\nnumber of dykes that now come to the light of day, and reflect that\r\nthe visible portions of some of them differ more than 3000 feet from\r\neach other in altitude, we can hardly escape the conviction that it\r\nwould be incredible that nowhere should the lava have flowed out at\r\nthe surface. Subsequent denudation has undoubtedly removed a great\r\nthickness of rock from what was the surface of the ground during older\r\nTertiary time, and hundreds of dykes are now exposed that doubtless\r\noriginally lay deeply buried beneath the overlying part of the earth's\r\ncrust through which they failed to rise. But some relics, at least, of\r\nthe outflow of lava might be expected to have survived. I believe that\r\nsuch relics remain to us in the great basalt-plateaux of Antrim and\r\nthe Inner Hebrides. These deep piles of almost horizontal sheets of\r\nbasalt, emanating from no great central volcanoes, but with evidence\r\nof many local vents, appear to me to have proceeded in large measure\r\nfrom dykes which, communicating with the surface of the ground, allowed\r\nthe molten material to flow out in successive streams with occasional\r\naccompaniments of fragmentary ejections.[217] The structure of the\r\nbasalt-plateaux, and their mode of origin, will form the subject of the\r\nnext division of this volume.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: It is interesting to note that in the great paper on\r\nPhysical Geology already cited, Hopkins considered the question of the\r\noutflow of lava from the fissures which he discussed. \"If the quantity\r\nof fluid matter forced into these fissures,\" he says, \"be more than\r\nthey can contain, it will, of course, be ejected over the surface; and\r\nif this ejection take place from a considerable number of fissures, and\r\nover a tolerably even surface, it is easy to conceive the formation\r\nof a bed of the ejected matter of moderate and tolerably uniform\r\nthickness, and of any extent\" (_op. cit._ p. 71).]\r\n\r\nWe can hardly suppose that the lava flowed out only in the western\r\nregion of the existing plateaux. Probably it was most frequently\r\nemitted and accumulated to the greatest depth in that area. But over\r\nthe centre of Scotland and North of England there may well have been\r\nmany places where dykes actually communicated with the outer air, and\r\nallowed their molten material to stream over the surrounding country,\r\neither from open fissures or from vents that rose along these. The\r\ndisappearance of such outflows need cause no surprise, when we consider\r\nthe extent of the denudation which many dykes demonstrate. I have\r\nelsewhere shown that all over Scotland there is abundant proof that\r\nhundreds and even thousands of feet of rock have been removed from\r\nparts of the surface of the land since the time of the uprise of the\r\ndykes.[218] The evidence of this denudation is singularly striking in\r\nsuch districts as that of Loch Lomond, where the difference of level\r\nbetween the outcrop of the dykes on the crest of the ridges and in\r\nthe bottom of the valleys exceeds 3000 feet. It is quite obvious, for\r\nexample, that had the deep hollow of Loch Lomond lain, as it now does,\r\nin the pathway of these dykes, the molten rock, instead of ascending\r\nto the summits of the hills, would have burst out on the floor of\r\nthe valley. We are, therefore, forced to admit that a deep glen and\r\nlake-basin have been in great measure hollowed out since the time of\r\nthe dykes. If a depth of many hundreds of feet of hard crystalline\r\nschists could have been removed in the interval, there need be no\r\ndifficulty in understanding that by the same process of waste, many\r\nsheets of solid basalt may have been gradually stripped off the face of\r\nCentral Scotland and Northern England.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: _Scenery of Scotland_, 2nd edit. (1887), p. 149. But see\r\nthe remarks already made (p. 150) on the curious coincidence sometimes\r\nobservable between the upper limit of a dyke and the overlying\r\ninequalities of surface.]\r\n\r\nThe association of fissures and dykes with the accumulation of thick\r\nand extensive volcanic plateaux, over so wide a region of North-western\r\nEurope as from Antrim to the North of Iceland, finds its parallel in\r\ndifferent parts of the world. One of the closest analogies presents\r\nitself among the Ghauts of the Bombay Presidency, where vast basaltic\r\nsheets, probably of Cretaceous age, display topographical and\r\nstructural features closely similar to those of the Tertiary volcanic\r\nplateaux of the British Isles. The dykes connected with these Indian\r\nbasaltic outflows correspond almost exactly in their general character\r\nand stratigraphical relations to those of this country. They occur in\r\ngreat numbers, rising through every rock in the district up to the\r\ncrests of the Ghauts, 4000 feet above the sea. They vary from 1 or 2\r\nto 10, 20, 40, and even occasionally 100 or 150 feet in width, and are\r\noften many miles in length. They observe a general parallelism in one\r\naverage direction, and show no perceptible difference in character even\r\nwhen traced up to elevations of 3000 and 4000 feet.[219]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: Mr. G. T. Clark, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xxv. (1869) p.\r\n163. For remarks on the connection of dykes with superficial lavas, see\r\n_postea_, p. 268.]\r\n\r\nThousands of square miles in the Western States and Territories of the\r\nAmerican Union have been similarly flooded with basic lavas. Denudation\r\nhas not yet advanced far enough to lay bare much of the platform on\r\nwhich these lavas rest. But the dykes that traverse the rocks outside\r\nof the lava-deserts afford an example of the structure which will\r\nultimately be revealed when the wide and continuous basalt-plains shall\r\nhave been trenched by innumerable valleys and reduced to fragmentary\r\nplateaux with lofty escarpments (p. 267).\r\n\r\nIt is to the modern eruptions of Iceland, however, that we turn for\r\nthe completest illustration of the phenomena connected with dykes\r\nand fissures. An account of these eruptions will therefore be given\r\nin Chapter xl. as an explanation of the history of the Tertiary\r\nbasalt-plateaux of Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n                             THE PLATEAUX\r\n\r\n  Nature and Arrangement of the Rocks: 1.

Fragmental\r\n  Rocks.--Agglomerates, Conglomerates, and Breccias--Tuffs and their\r\n  accompaniments.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the structure and history of those volcanic\r\nmasses which, during Tertiary time, were ejected to the surface\r\nwithin the area of the British Islands, and now remain as extensive\r\nplateaux. Short though the interval has been in a geological sense\r\nsince these rocks were erupted, it has been long enough to allow of\r\nvery considerable movements of the ground and of enormous denudation,\r\nas will be more fully discussed in Chapters xlviii. and xlix. Hence\r\nthe superficial records of Tertiary volcanic action have been reduced\r\nto a series of broken and isolated fragments. I have already stated\r\nthat no evidence now remains to show to what extent there were actual\r\nsuperficial outbursts of volcanic material over much of the dyke-region\r\nof Britain. The subsequent waste of the surface has been so enormous\r\nthat various lava-fields may quite possibly have stretched across parts\r\nof England and Scotland, whence they have since been wholly stripped\r\noff, leaving behind them only that wonderful system of dykes from which\r\ntheir molten materials were supplied.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt, however, that whether or not other Phlegrean\r\nfields extended over portions of the country whence they have since\r\nbeen worn away, the chief volcanic tract lay in a broad and long hollow\r\nthat stretched from the south of Antrim to the Minch. From the southern\r\nto the northern limit of the fragmentary lava-fields that remain in\r\nthis depression is a distance of some 250 miles, and the average\r\nbreadth of ground within which these lava-fields are preserved may be\r\ntaken to range from 20 to 50 miles. If, therefore, the sheets of basalt\r\nand layers of tuff extended over the whole of this strip of country,\r\nthey covered a space of some 7000 or 8000 square miles. But they were\r\nnot confined to the area of the British Islands. Similar rocks rise\r\ninto an extensive plateau in the Faroe Islands, and it may reasonably\r\nbe conjectured that the remarkable submarine ridge which extends thence\r\nto the North-west of Scotland, and separates the basin of the Atlantic\r\nfrom that of the Arctic Ocean, is partly at least of volcanic origin.\r\nStill further north come the extensive Tertiary basaltic plateaux of\r\nIceland, while others of like aspect and age cover a vast area in\r\nSouthern Greenland. Without contending that one continuous belt of\r\nlava-streams stretched from Ireland to Iceland and Greenland, we can\r\nhave no doubt that in older Tertiary time the north-west of Europe was\r\nthe scene of more widely-extended volcanic activity than had shown\r\nitself at any previous period in the geological history of the whole\r\ncontinent. The present active vents of Iceland and Jan Mayen are not\r\nimprobably the descendants in uninterrupted succession of those that\r\nsupplied the materials of the Tertiary basaltic plateaux, the volcanic\r\nfires slowly dying out from south to north. But so continuous and\r\nstupendous has been the work of denudation in these northern regions,\r\nwhere winds and waves, rain and frost, floe-ice and glaciers reach\r\ntheir highest level of energy, that the present extensive sheets of\r\nigneous rock can be regarded only as magnificent relics, the grandeur\r\nof which furnishes some measure of the magnitude of the last episode in\r\nthe extended volcanic history of Britain.\r\n\r\nThe long and wide western valley in which the basalt-plateaux of this\r\ncountry were accumulated seems, from a remote antiquity, to have been\r\na theatre of considerable geological activity. There are traces of\r\nsome such valley or depression even back in the period of the Torridon\r\nSandstone of the north-west. This formation, as we have seen, was laid\r\ndown between the great ridge of the Outer Hebrides and some other land\r\nto the east, of which a few of the higher mountains, once buried under\r\nthe sandstone, are now being revealed by denudation between Loch Maree\r\nand Loch Broom, and also in Assynt. The conglomerates and volcanic\r\nrocks of Lorne may represent the site of one of the older water-basins\r\nof this ancient hollow. The Carboniferous rocks, which run through the\r\nNorth of Ireland, cross into Cantyre, and are found even as far north\r\nas the Sound of Mull, mark how, in later Palæozoic time, the same\r\nstrip of country was a region of subsidence and sedimentation. During\r\nthe Mesozoic ages, similar operations were continued; the hollow sank\r\nseveral thousand feet, and Jurassic strata to that depth filled it up.\r\nBefore the Cretaceous period, underground movements had disrupted and\r\nirregularly upheaved the Jurassic deposits, and prolonged denudation\r\nhad worn them away, so that when the Cretaceous formations came to be\r\nlaid down on the once more subsiding depression, they were spread out\r\nwith a strong unconformability on everything older than themselves,\r\nresting on many successive horizons of the Jurassic system, and passing\r\nfrom these over to the submerged hillsides of the crystalline schists.\r\nYet again, after the accumulation of the Chalk, the sea-floor along\r\nthe same line was ridged up into land, and the Chalk, exposed to\r\ndenudation, was deeply trenched by valleys, and entirely removed from\r\nwide tracts which it once covered.\r\n\r\nIt was in this long broad hollow, with its memorials of repeated\r\nsubsidences and upheavals, sedimentation and denudation, that the\r\nvigour of subterranean energy at last showed itself in volcanic\r\noutbreaks, and in the gradual piling up of the materials of the\r\nbasalt-plateaux. So far as we know, these outbursts were subærial.\r\nAt least no trace of any marine deposit has yet been found even at\r\nthe base of the pile of volcanic rocks. Sheet after sheet of lava was\r\npoured out, until several thousand feet had accumulated, so as perhaps\r\nto fill up the whole depression, and once more to change entirely the\r\naspect of the region. But the volcanic period, long and important as\r\nit was in the geological history of the country, came to an end. It,\r\ntoo, was merely an episode during which denudation still continued\r\nactive, and since which subterranean disturbance and superficial\r\nerosion have again transformed the topography. In wandering over\r\nthese ancient lava-fields, we see on every hand the most stupendous\r\nevidence of change. They have been dislocated by faults, sometimes with\r\na displacement of hundreds of feet, and have been hollowed out into\r\ndeep and wide valleys and arms of the sea. Their piles of solid rock,\r\nhundreds of feet thick, have been totally stripped off from wide tracts\r\nof ground which were once undoubtedly buried under them. Hence, late\r\nthough the volcanic events are in the long history of the land, they\r\nare already separated from us by so vast an interval that there has\r\nbeen time for cutting down the wide plateaux of basalt into a series of\r\nmere scattered fragments. But the process of land-sculpture has been of\r\nthe utmost service to geology, for, by laying bare the inner structure\r\nof these plateaux, it has provided materials of almost unequalled value\r\nand extent for the study of one type of volcanic action.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. NATURE AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE ROCKS OF THE PLATEAUX\r\n\r\nThe superficial outbursts of volcanic action during Tertiary time in\r\nBritain are represented by a comparatively small variety of rocks.\r\nThese consist almost wholly of basalts, but include a number of less\r\nbasic rocks which may be classed as andesites. Many andesitic sheets,\r\nlike the andesitic dykes, have been intruded into the basalts, and are\r\nreally sills.\r\n\r\nBesides the lavas of the basaltic-plateaux there are intercalated\r\ndeposits of tuffs and breccias and large masses of agglomerate. A brief\r\nnotice of the general petrography of the various constituents of the\r\nplateaux and their mode of occurrence will here be given. The intrusive\r\nbosses which have disrupted the superficial lavas will be discussed in\r\nsubsequent chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. LAVAS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Petrographical Characters_\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Basalts and Dolerites._--In external characters these rocks\r\nrange from coarsely crystalline varieties, in which the constituent\r\nminerals may be more or less readily detected with the naked eye or a\r\nfield-lens, to dense black compounds in which only a few porphyritic\r\ncrystals may be megascopically visible. One of their characteristic\r\nfeatures is the presence of the ophitic structure, sometimes only\r\nfeebly developed, sometimes showing itself in great perfection.\r\nMany of the rocks are holocrystalline, but usually show more or\r\nless interstitial matter; in others the texture is finer, and the\r\ninterstitial matter more developed; in no case, as far as I have\r\nobserved, are there any glassy varieties, which are restricted to\r\nthe dykes and sills, though in some of the basalts the proportion of\r\nglassy or incompletely devitrified substance is considerable. The\r\nfelspars are generally of the characteristic lath-shaped forms, and\r\nare usually quite clear and fresh. The augite resembles that of the\r\ndykes, occurring sometimes in large plates that enclose the felspars,\r\nat other times in a finely granular form. Olivine is frequently\r\nnot to be detected, even by green alteration products. Magnetite\r\nis sometimes present in such quantity as to affect the compass of\r\nthe field-geologist. Porphyritic varieties occur with large felspar\r\nphenocrysts; but such varieties are, I think, less frequent among the\r\nplateau-rocks than among the dykes. They are well developed in the west\r\npart of the island of Canna, and have been described from the Faroe\r\nislands. Occasionally the plateau lavas are full of enclosed fragments\r\nof other rocks which have been carried up in the ascending magma.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Andesites and Trachytes._--Probably the majority of these rocks\r\nwhere they occur intercalated between the basalts of the plateaux are,\r\nas already remarked, intrusive sheets rather than true lavas. But\r\nthey have also been poured out intermittently among the basalts and\r\ndolerites. The most extensive development of lavas which are readily\r\ndistinguishable from the group of plateau-basalts, and must be placed\r\nin the present series, occurs in the island of Mull. These rocks form\r\npart of a group of pale lavas which overlie the main mass of the\r\nplateau-basalts, and cap the mountain Ben More, together with several\r\nof its lofty neighbours. They are interstratified with true ophitic\r\ndolerites, and basalts showing characteristic granular augite. They\r\nare not so heavy as the ordinary plateau-lavas, their specific gravity\r\nranging from 2·55 to 2·74. Externally they are light grey in colour\r\nand dull in texture, sometimes strongly amygdaloidal, sometimes with a\r\nremarkable platy structure, which, in the process of weathering, causes\r\nthem to split up like stratified rocks. In some of their amygdaloidal\r\nvarieties the cells are filled with epidote, which also appears in the\r\nfissures, and sometimes even as a constituent of the rock.\r\n\r\nSpecimens from this \"pale group\" of Ben More, when examined in thin\r\nslices under the microscope, were found by Dr. Hatch to consist almost\r\nwholly of felspar in minute laths or microlites, but in no instance\r\nsufficiently definite for satisfactory determination. In one of them\r\nhe observed that each lath of felspar passed imperceptibly into\r\nthose adjacent to it; the double refraction being very weak, and the\r\ntwin-striation, if present, not being traceable.[220] More recently my\r\ncolleague, Mr. W. W. Watts, has looked at some of the same slides. He\r\nis disposed to class the rocks rather with the trachytes than the\r\nandesites. He remarks that \"in the apparent holocrystalline character,\r\nthe size and shape of the felspars, the sort of damascened appearance\r\nin polarized light, the finely scattered iron-ores and the presence\r\nof a pale green hornblende, possibly augite, in small, often complex,\r\ngrains, these rocks much resemble the Carboniferous trachytes of the\r\nGarlton Hills in Scotland.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 220: In the course of my investigations I have had many\r\nhundreds of thin slices cut from the Tertiary volcanic rocks for\r\nmicroscopic determination. These I have myself studied in so far as\r\ntheir microscopic structure appeared likely to aid in the investigation\r\nof those larger questions of geological structure in which I was\r\nmore especially interested. But for further and more detailed study\r\nI placed them with Dr. Hatch, who submitted to me the results of his\r\npreliminary examination, and where these offered points of geological\r\nimport I availed myself of them in the memoir published in 1888 in\r\nthe _Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh_. I have retained\r\nmost of these citations in their place in the present volume, and have\r\nsupplemented them by notes supplied to me from fresh observations by\r\nMr. Watts and Mr. Harker. Professor Judd, in a series of valuable\r\npapers, has discussed the general petrography of the Tertiary volcanic\r\nrocks (_Quart. Jour. Geog. Soc._ vols. xxxix. xli. xlii. xlvi. xlix.)]\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting lavas of the Tertiary volcanic series is\r\nthe \"pitchstone-porphyry\" of the Scuir of Eigg. This rock, the latest\r\nknown outflow of lava in any of the volcanic areas of Britain, was\r\nformerly classed with the acid series. Microscopical and chemical\r\nanalyses prove it, however, to be of intermediate composition, and\r\nto be referable to the andesites or dacites. It is more particularly\r\ndescribed in Chapter xxxviii.\r\n\r\nProfessor Judd, collecting the andesitic rocks as a whole (both lavas\r\nand sills), has grouped them into amphibole and mica-andesites, and\r\npyroxene-andesites.[221] The thick lumpy and non-persistent sheets of\r\nthese rocks sometimes found near the centres of protrusion of the\r\ngabbros and granophyres are probably sills.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 221: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlvi. (1890), p. 356.\r\nProfessor Judd has there described under the name of \"propylites\"\r\nvarious members of the volcanic series which he believes to have\r\nundergone alteration from solfataric action. I have not been able to\r\ndiscover any trace of such action, but I have found that the lavas of\r\nthe plateaux assume a peculiar condition where they have been affected\r\nby large intrusive masses of granophyre or gabbro. (See _postea_,\r\nChapter xlvi.)]\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Rhyolites._--In the Antrim plateau a group of rhyolite bosses\r\noccurs, some of which have been claimed as superficial lavas. In\r\nsome cases it can be demonstrated that they are intrusive, and in no\r\ninstance can they be decisively shown to have escaped in streams at\r\nthe surface. It is probable, however, that some of these bosses did\r\nactually communicate with the outer air, for between the lower and\r\nupper group of basalts in this plateau, bands of rhyolitic conglomerate\r\noccur which may indicate the degradation of exposed masses of rhyolite.\r\nThe description of these Antrim bosses will be given in Chapter xlvii.,\r\nin connection with the acid eruptive rocks of the Tertiary volcanic\r\nseries.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Structure in the Field_\r\n\r\nPassing now to the consideration of the lavas as they are built up\r\ninto the plateaux, we have to note their distinctive characters as\r\nindividual sheets of rock, and their influence on the topography of the\r\nregions in which they occur. Every tourist who has sailed along the\r\ncliffs of Antrim, Mull, Skye, or the Faroe Islands is familiar with the\r\nsingular terraced structure of the great volcanic escarpments which\r\nstretch as mural precipices along these picturesque shores. Successive\r\nsheets of lava, either horizontal or only gently inclined, rise above\r\neach other from base to summit of the cliffs as parallel bars of brown\r\nrock with intervening strips of bright green grassy slope.\r\n\r\nThe geologist who for the first time visits these coast-lines is\r\nimpressed by the persistence of the same lithological characters\r\ngiving rise to the same topographical features. He soon realises\r\nthat the plateaux, so imposingly truncated by the great escarpments\r\nthat spring from the edge of the sea, are built up essentially of\r\ndark lavas--basalts and dolerites--and that fragmental volcanic\r\naccompaniments, though here and there well developed, play, on the\r\nwhole, a quite insignificant part in the structure and composition\r\nof these thick piles of volcanic material. Closer examination in the\r\nfield enables him to ascertain that, regarded as rock-masses, the lavas\r\ninclude four distinct types:--\r\n\r\n1st. Thick, massive, prismatic or rudely-jointed sheets, rather\r\nmore coarsely crystalline and obviously more durable than the other\r\ntypes, inasmuch as they project in tabular ledges and tend to retain\r\nperpendicular faces owing to the falling away of slices of the rock\r\nalong lines of vertical joints. Many rocks of this type are undoubtedly\r\nintrusive sheets, and as such will be further referred to in a later\r\nchapter. But the type includes also true superficial lavas which\r\nshow the characteristic slaggy or vesicular bands at their upper and\r\nlower surfaces. The mere presence of such bands may not be enough,\r\nindeed, absolutely to establish that the rock possessing them flowed\r\nat the surface as a lava, for they are occasionally, though it must be\r\nconfessed rarely, exhibited by true sills. But the rough scoriaceous\r\ntop of a lava-stream, and the presence of fragments of this surface\r\nin the overlying tuff, or wrapped round by the next succeeding lava,\r\nsufficiently attest the true superficial outflow of the mass.\r\n\r\n2nd. Prismatic or columnar basalts, which, as at the Giant's Causeway\r\nand Staffa, have long attracted notice as one of the most striking\r\ntopographical elements of the plateaux. Columnar structures are typical\r\nof the more compact heavy basalts. A considerable variety is observable\r\nin the degree of perfection of their development. Where they are least\r\ndefinite, the rock is traversed by vertical joints, somewhat more\r\nregular and close-set than those in the dolerites, by the intersection\r\nof which it is separated into rude quadrangular or polygonal columns.\r\nThe true columnar structure is shown in two chief forms. (_a_) The rock\r\nis divided into close-fitting parallel, usually six-sided columns; the\r\nnumber of sides varying, however, from three up to nine. The columns\r\nrun the whole thickness of the bed, and vary from 8 or 10 to 40 or even\r\n80 feet in length. They are segmented by cross joints which sometimes,\r\nas at Giant's Causeway, take the ball-and-socket form. Occasionally\r\nthey are curved, as at the well-known Clam-shell cave of Staffa.\r\n(_b_) The prisms are much smaller, and diverge in wavy groups crowded\r\nconfusedly over each other, but with a general tendency upwards. This\r\nstarch-like aggregation may be observed superposed directly upon the\r\nmore regular columnar form as at the Giant's Causeway and also at\r\nStaffa. Excellent illustrations of both these types may be seen at many\r\npoints along the sea-cliffs of the Inner Hebrides; the western coast\r\nof Skye, the south-west side of Mull, and the cliffs of the island of\r\nCanna may be specially cited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 259.--Section of scoriaceous and prismatic Basalt,\r\nCamas Tharbernish, north shore of Canna Island.]\r\n\r\nThough generally rather compact, becoming indeed dense, almost vitreous\r\nrocks in some sheets, the columnar basalts are often more or less\r\ncellular throughout, and highly slaggy along their upper and under\r\nsurfaces. In some cases, as in that of a prismatic sheet which overlies\r\nthe rough scoriaceous lava of Camas Tharbernish, in the island of\r\nCanna, the rows of vesicles are disposed in lines parallel to the under\r\nsurface of the sheet (Fig. 259.)\r\n\r\nAs already remarked with regard to the massive, rudely-jointed sheets,\r\nmany of the most perfectly columnar rocks of the plateaux are not\r\nsuperficial lavas, but intrusive sills, bosses or dykes. Conspicuous\r\nexamples of such sills are displayed on the coast of Trotternish in\r\nSkye, and of the bosses and dykes at the eastern end of Canna. To these\r\nfurther reference will be made in the sequel. It is not always possible\r\nto be certain that columnar sheets which appear to be regularly\r\nintercalated among the undoubted lavas of the volcanic series may not\r\nbe really intrusive. In some instances, indeed, we can demonstrate that\r\nthey are so, when after continuing perfectly parallel with the lavas\r\nabove and below them, they eventually break across them. One of the\r\nmost remarkable examples of this feature is supplied by the great sill\r\nof the south-west of Stromö, in the Faroe Islands, of which I shall\r\ngive some account in Chapter xlii. (Figs. 312, 328, 329).\r\n\r\n3rd. Slaggy or amygdaloidal lavas without any regular jointed\r\nstructure, but often with roughly scoriform upper and under layers, and\r\ntending to decay into brown earthy debris. Some of the upper surfaces\r\nof such sheets among the Tertiary basalt-plateaux must have resembled\r\nthe so-called \"Aa\" of the Sandwich Islands. A striking example of the\r\nstructure may be noticed at Camas Tharbernish, on the north coast of\r\nthe Island of Canna. There the hummocks on the upper surface of a\r\nslaggy basalt measure about 15 feet in breadth, and rise about three\r\nfeet above the hollows between them, like a succession of waves (see\r\nFig. 259). The steam-holes are disposed in a general direction parallel\r\nto the strike of the hummocks.\r\n\r\nGreat variety obtains in the size and shape of the vesicles. Huge\r\ncavities a foot or more in diameter may occasionally be found, and from\r\nsuch extremes every gradation may be traced down to minute pore-like\r\nvacuoles that can hardly be made out even with a strong lens. In regard\r\nto the deformation of the vesicles, it is a familiar general rule that\r\nthey have been drawn out in the direction of the flow of the original\r\nlava. Occasionally they have become straight, narrow, sometimes\r\nbifurcating pipes, several inches long, and only an eighth of an inch\r\nor so in diameter.[222] A number of such pipes, parallel to each other,\r\nresembles a row of worm-burrows (see Fig. 2).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 222: Some examples have been deposited by me in the Museum\r\nof Practical Geology, Jermyn Street, in the case illustrating\r\nrock-structures. The elongation of the vesicles into annelide-like\r\ntubes may also be observed among the stones in the volcanic\r\nagglomerates.]\r\n\r\nIt may often be noticed that, even where the basalt is most perfectly\r\nprismatic, it presents a cellular and even slaggy structure at the\r\nbottom. The rock that forms the Giant's Causeway, for instance, is\r\ndistinctly vesicular, the vesicles being drawn out in a general east\r\nand west direction. The beautiful columnar bed of Staffa is likewise\r\nslaggy and amygdaloidal for a foot or so upwards from its base, and\r\nportions of this lower layer have here and there been caught up and\r\ninvolved in the more compact material above it. Even the bottom of the\r\nconfusedly prismatic bed above the columnar one on that island also\r\npresents a cellular texture. A similar rock at Ardtun, in Mull, passes\r\nupward into a rugged slag and confused mass of basalt blocks, over\r\nwhich the leaf-beds lie.\r\n\r\nAmygdaloidal structure is more or less developed throughout the whole\r\nseries of basalts. But it is especially marked in certain abundant\r\nsheets, which, for the sake of distinction, are called amygdaloids.\r\nThese beds, which form a considerable proportion of the materials of\r\nevery one of the plateaux, are distinguished by the abundance and\r\nlarge size of their vesicles. In some places, the cavities occupy at\r\nleast as much of the rock as the solid matrix in which they lie. They\r\nhave generally been filled up with some infiltrated mineral--calcite,\r\nchalcedony, zeolites, etc. The amygdales of the west of Skye and of\r\nAntrim have long been noted for their zeolites. As a consequence of\r\ntheir cellular texture and the action of infiltrating water upon them,\r\nthese amygdaloidal sheets are always more or less decomposed. Their\r\ndull, lumpy, amorphous aspect contrasts well with the sharply-defined\r\ncolumnar sheets above and below them, and as they crumble down they\r\nare apt to be covered over with vegetation. Hence, on a sea-cliff\r\nor escarpment, the green declivities between the prominent columnar\r\nbasalts usually mark the place of such less durable bands.\r\n\r\nExceedingly slag-like lavas are to be seen among the amygdaloids,\r\nimmediately preceded and followed by beds of compact black basalt\r\nwith few or no vesicles. From the manner in which such rocks yield\r\nto the weather, they often assume a singularly deceptive resemblance\r\nto agglomerates. One of the best examples of this resemblance which\r\nhave come under my notice is that of the rock on which stands Dunluce\r\nCastle, on the north coast of Antrim. Huge rounded blocks of a harder\r\nconsistency than the rest of the rock project from the surface of\r\nthe cliffs, like the bombs of a true volcanic agglomerate, while the\r\nmatrix in which they are wrapped has decayed from around them. But an\r\nexamination of this matrix will soon convince the observer that it is\r\nstrongly amygdaloidal, and that the apparent \"bombs\" are only harder\r\nand less cellular portions of it. The contrast between the weathering\r\nof the two parts of the rocks seems to have arisen from an original\r\nvariety in the relative abundance of steam-cavities. The origin of\r\nsuch nodular or pillow-like blocks has been already referred to at\r\npp. 26 and 193. Another singular instance occurs at the foot of the\r\noutlier of Fionn Chro (Fig. 360), in the island of Rum. A conspicuous\r\nband underlying the basalts there might readily be taken for a\r\nbasalt-conglomerate. But in this case, also, the apparent matrix is\r\nfound to be amygdaloidal, and the rounded blocks are really amygdales,\r\nsometimes a foot in length, filled or lined with quartz, chalcedony, &c.\r\n\r\nA somewhat different structure, in which, however, the appearance\r\nof volcanic breccia or agglomerate due to explosion from a vent is\r\nsimulated, may be alluded to here. The best instance which I have\r\nobserved of it occurs at the south end of Loch-na-Mna, in the island of\r\nEigg, within a basalt which is remarkable for a streaky flow-structure.\r\nOn the weathered faces the streaky layers may be observed to have\r\nbeen broken up, and their disconnected fragments have been involved\r\nin ordinary basalt wherein this flow-structure is not developed,\r\nwhile large blocks and irregular masses are wrapped round in a more\r\ndecomposing matrix. There can be no doubt that in such cases we see the\r\neffects of the disruption of chilled crusts, and the entanglement of\r\nthe broken pieces in the still fluid lava.\r\n\r\nIt is a common belief that the filling in of the steam-cavities has\r\ntaken place long subsequent to the volcanic period, by the slow\r\npercolation of meteoric water through the rock. I believe, however,\r\nthat at least in some cases, if not in all, the conversion of the\r\nvesicular lavas into amygdaloids was effected during the volcanic\r\nperiod. Thus it can be shown that the basalts which have been disrupted\r\nby the gabbros and granophyres were already amygdaloids before these\r\nbasic intrusions disturbed them, for the kernels of calcite, zeolite,\r\netc., have shared in the general metamorphism induced in the enclosing\r\nrock. Again, the blocks of amygdaloid contained in the agglomerates of\r\nthe volcanic series are in every respect like the amygdaloidal lavas\r\nof the plateaux. It would thus seem that the infilling of the cavities\r\nwith mineral secretions was not merely a long secular process of\r\ninfiltration from the cool atmosphere, but was more rapidly completed\r\nby the operation of warmer water, either supplied from volcanic sources\r\nor heated by the still high temperature of the cellular lavas into\r\nwhich it descended from the surface.[223]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 223: Professor J. D. Dana, originally an advocate of\r\ninfiltration from above, subsequently supported the view that the\r\nkernels of amygdaloids were filled in by the action of moisture within\r\nthe rocks during the time of cooling.--_Amer. Journ. Sci._ ser. 3, vol.\r\nxx. (1880), p. 331. Messrs. Harker and Marr have demonstrated that the\r\nLower Silurian vesicular lavas of the Lake district had already become\r\namygdaloids before the uprise of the Shap granite.--_Quart. Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc._ vol. xlix. (1893).]\r\n\r\n4th. Banded or stratiform lavas, consisting of successive parallel\r\nlayers or bands which weather into projecting ribs and flutings. The\r\ndeceptive resemblance to sedimentary rocks thus produced has no doubt\r\nfrequently led to these lavas being mistaken for tuffs. As I have\r\nrecently found them to be much more plentiful than I had supposed, a\r\nmore detailed description of them seems to be required.\r\n\r\nThe banded character arises from marked distinctions in the texture\r\nof different layers of a lava-sheet. In some cases (_a_) these\r\ndistinctions arise from differences in the size of the crystals or in\r\nthe disposition of the component minerals of the rock; in others (_b_)\r\nfrom the varying number and size of the vesicles, which may be large or\r\nabundantly crowded together in some layers, and small or only sparsely\r\ndeveloped in others. The structure thus points to original conditions\r\nof the lava at the time of its emission and may be regarded as, to some\r\nextent, a kind of flow-structure on a large scale.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Where the banding is due to differences of crystalline texture,\r\nthe constituent felspars, augites, and iron-ores may be seen even with\r\nthe naked eye as well-defined minerals along the prominent surfaces\r\nof the harder ribs, while the broader intervening flutings of finer\r\nmaterial show the same minerals in minuter forms. The alternating\r\nlayers of coarser and finer crystallization lie, on the whole,\r\nparallel with the upper and under surfaces of the sheets in which they\r\noccur. But they likewise undulate like the streaky lines in ordinary\r\nflow-structure.\r\n\r\nBanded structure of this type may be seen well developed in the\r\nlower parts of the basalt-plateaux throughout the Inner Hebrides and\r\nthe Faroe Islands. A specimen taken from the west end of the island\r\nof Sanday, near Canna, which showed the structure by a conspicuous\r\nparallel fluting on weathered surfaces, was sliced for microscopical\r\nexamination. Mr. Harker has been kind enough to supply me with the\r\nfollowing observations regarding this slice:--\r\n\r\n\"In the slice [6660][224] the banding becomes less conspicuous under the\r\nmicroscope. The rock is of basaltic composition, and, with reference\r\nto its micro-structure, might be styled a fine-grained olivine-diabase\r\nor olivine-dolerite in some parts of the slice, an olivine-basalt in\r\nothers. It consists of abundant grains of olivine, imperfect octahedra\r\nand shapeless granules of magnetite, little simple or twinned prisms\r\nof labradorite, and a pale brown augite. The last-named mineral is\r\nalways the latest product of consolidation, but it varies in habit,\r\nbeing sometimes in ophitic patches moulded upon or enclosing the other\r\nminerals, sometimes in small granules occupying the interstices between\r\nthe felspars and other crystals. The ophitic habit predominates in the\r\nslice, while the granulitic comes in especially along certain bands. If\r\nthe former be taken as indicative of tranquil conditions, the latter of\r\na certain amount of movement in the rock during the latest stages of\r\nits consolidation, the banding, though not strictly a flow-structure,\r\nmay be ascribed in some degree to a flowing movement of the nearly\r\nsolidified rock. There is, however, more than this merely structural\r\ndifference between the several bands. They differ to some extent in the\r\nrelative proportions of the minerals, especially of olivine and augite;\r\nwhich points to a considerable flowing movement at an early stage in a\r\nmagma which was initially not homogeneous.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: The figures within square brackets throughout the\r\nfollowing pages refer to the numbers of the microscopic slides in the\r\nGeological Survey collection, where I have deposited all those prepared\r\nfrom my specimens.]\r\n\r\n(_b_) Where the banding arises from the distribution of the vesicles,\r\nsomewhat similar weathered surfaces are produced. In some instances,\r\nwhile the basalt is throughout finely cellular, interposed bands of\r\nharder, rather finer-grained and less thoroughly vesicular character\r\nserve to give the stratified appearance. Instances may be observed\r\nwhere the vesicles have been crowded together in certain bands, which\r\nconsequently weather out differently from the layers above and below\r\nthem. An excellent illustration of this arrangement occurs in the\r\nlowest lava but one of the largest of the three picturesque stacks\r\nknown as Macleod's Maidens on the west coast of Skye (Figs. 260, 283,\r\n284 and 287). This lava is thoroughly amygdaloidal, but the vesicles\r\nare specially crowded together in certain parallel bands from an inch\r\nto three or four inches thick. Some of these layers lie close to each\r\nother, while elsewhere there may be a band of more close-grained, less\r\nvesicular material between them. But the most singular feature of the\r\nrock is to be seen in the shape and position of the vesicles that are\r\ncrowded together in the cellular bands. Instead of being drawn out into\r\nflattened forms in the general direction of banding, they are placed\r\ntogether at high angles. Each layer remains parallel to the general\r\nbedding, but its vesicles are steeply inclined in one direction, which\r\nwas doubtless that of the flow of the still unconsolidated lava.[225]\r\nWeathering along these bands, the lava might easily be mistaken at a\r\nlittle distance for a tuff or other stratified intercalation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 225: This elongation of vesicles, more or less perpendicular to\r\nthe general bedding, may be noticed sometimes even in sills, as will be\r\nshown in a later Chapter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 260.--Banded amygdaloidal basalt showing layers of elongated\r\n  and steeply inclined vesicles, Macleod's Maidens, Skye.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBanded lavas possessing the characters now described are of frequent\r\noccurrence among the Inner Hebrides. Many striking examples of them may\r\nbe seen along the west coast of Skye. Still more abundant in Faroe,\r\nthey form one of the most conspicuous features in the geology of that\r\ngroup of islands. Along the whole of its western seaboard, on island\r\nafter island, they are particularly prominent in the lower parts of\r\nthe precipices, while the upper parts consist largely of amorphous or\r\nprismatic sheets. So much do they resemble stratified rocks that it was\r\nnot until I had landed at various points that I could satisfy myself\r\nthat they are really banded lavas.[226]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: For recent contributions to the Geology of the Faroe\r\nIslands, see Prof. James Geikie, _Trans.

Ordinary flow-structure, save in these banded lavas, is rather\r\nrare among the plateaux. It may, however, be occasionally observed,\r\nwhere there is no distinct banding. On a weathered surface it appears\r\nin fine, widely parallel streaks, which are sometimes wavy, puckered\r\nand broken up, as in rhyolites and felsites, while the porphyritic\r\nfelspars are arranged with their long axes in the direction of flow.\r\nA good example of these characters may be seen on the summit of the\r\nDùn Can--the remarkable truncated cone which forms the highest point\r\non the Island of Raasay. The rock is a black olivine-basalt, partly\r\namygdaloidal, with zeolites filling up the cavities, and its flow-lines\r\nare prominent on the weathered faces where they lie parallel to the\r\ngeneral bedding of the lavas. Another illustration may be observed\r\nin the basalt already cited from Loch-na-Mna, in the island of Eigg,\r\nwhere the rock presents in places a remarkable streaky structure\r\nwhich, though hardly visible on a fresh fracture, reveals itself on a\r\nweathered face in thin nearly parallel ribs coincident in direction\r\nwith the upper and under surfaces of the mass.\r\n\r\nGreat variety is to be found in the thickness of different sheets of\r\nlava in the plateaux. Some of them are not more than 6 or 8 feet;\r\nothers reach to 80 or 100 feet, and sometimes, though rarely, to even\r\ngreater dimensions. In Antrim, the average thickness of the flows is\r\nprobably from 15 to 20 feet.[227] In the fine coast-sections at the\r\nGiant's Causeway, however, some bands may be seen far in excess of that\r\nmeasurement. The bed that forms the Causeway, for instance, is about\r\n60 or 70 feet thick, and seems to become even thicker further east.\r\nAlong the great escarpment, 700 feet high, which rises from the shores\r\nof Gribon, on the west coast of Mull, there are twenty separate beds,\r\nwhich give an average of 35 feet for the thickness of each flow. On\r\nthe great range of sea-precipices along the west coast of Skye, which\r\npresent the most stupendous section of the basalts anywhere to be\r\nseen within the limits of the British Islands, the average thickness\r\nof the beds can be conveniently measured. At the Talisker cliffs some\r\nof the flows are not more than 6 or 8 feet; others are 30 or 40 feet.\r\nThe chief precipice, 957 feet high (Fig. 286), contains at least 18 or\r\n20 separate lava-sheets, which thus average of from 47 to 53 feet in\r\nthickness. In the cliffs that form the seaward margin of the tableland\r\nof Macleod's Tables (Fig. 283) fourteen successive beds of basalt can\r\nbe counted in a vertical section of 400 feet, which is equal to an\r\naverage thickness of about 28 feet. But some of the basalts are only\r\nabout 6 feet thick, while others are 50 or 60. The Hoe of Duirinish,\r\n759 feet high, is composed of about sixteen distinct beds, which\r\nthus have a mean thickness of 46 feet. The average thickness of the\r\nsuccessive flows on Dunvegan Head, which is 1000 feet high and contains\r\nat least twenty-five separate sheets, is about 40 feet. Still further\r\nnorth, the cliffs, 800 feet high, comprise sixteen successive flows,\r\nwhich have thus an average of 50 feet each. Among the Faroe Islands the\r\naverage thickness of the basalt-sheets seems to be nearly the same as\r\nin Britain. Thus in the magnificent ranges of precipices of Kalsö, Kunö\r\nand Borö, forty or more sheets may be counted in the vast walls of rock\r\nsome 2000 feet high, giving a mean of about 50 feet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 227: See Explanation of Sheet 20, Geol. Survey, Ireland, p. 11.]\r\n\r\nEach bed appears, on a cursory inspection, to retain its average\r\nthickness, and to be continuous for a long distance. But I believe that\r\nthis persistence is in great measure deceptive. We can seldom follow\r\nthe same bed with absolutely unbroken continuity for more than a mile\r\nor two. Even in the most favourable conditions, such as are afforded by\r\na bare sea-cliff on which every sheet can be seen, there occur small\r\nfaults, gullies where the rocks are for the time concealed, slopes of\r\ndebris, and other failures of continuity; while the rocks are generally\r\nso like each other, that on the further side of any such interruption,\r\nit is not always possible to make sure that we are still tracing the\r\nsame bed of basalt which we may have been previously following. On\r\nthe other hand, a careful examination of one of these great natural\r\nsections will usually supply us with proofs that, while the bedded\r\ncharacter may continue well marked, the individual sheets die out, and\r\nare replaced by others of similar character. Cases may not infrequently\r\nbe observed where the basalt of one sheet abruptly wedges out, and is\r\nreplaced by that of another. Where both are of the same variety of\r\nrock, it requires close inspection to make out the difference between\r\nthem; but where one is a green, dull, earthy, amorphous amygdaloid,\r\nand the other is a compact, black, prismatic basalt, the contrast\r\nbetween the two beds can be recognized from a distance (Fig. 261). In\r\nthe basaltic cliffs of the west coast of Skye, the really lenticular\r\ncharacter of the flows can be well seen. I may especially cite the\r\ngreat headland south of Talisker Bay, already referred to, where, in\r\nthe pile of nearly horizontal sheets, two beds may be seen to die out,\r\none towards the north, the other towards the south. Further north,\r\nin the cliff of the Hoe of Duirinish, a similar structure presents\r\nitself. Along the coast-cliffs of Mull, Morven and Canna the same\r\nfact is clearly displayed. Thus on the west side of the Sound of Mull\r\nthe slopes above Fishnish Bay show a group of basalts, which die out\r\nsouthward, and are overlapped by a younger group that has been poured\r\nover their ends. Such sections are best seen in the evening, when the\r\ngrass-covered lavas show their successive sheets by their respective\r\nshadows, their individuality being lost in the full light of day. A\r\nmore striking example occurs beyond the west end of Glen More in Mull,\r\nwhere one series of basalts has been tilted up, probably during some\r\nvolcanic episode, and has had a younger series banked up against its\r\nedges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 261.--Termination of Basalt-beds, Carsaig, Mull.]\r\n\r\nIn Antrim also, remarkable evidence is presented of the rapid\r\nattenuation not of single beds only, but of a whole series of basalts.\r\nThus, at Ballycastle, the group of lavas known as the Lower Basalts,\r\nwhich underlie the well-known horizon of iron-ore, are at least 350\r\nfeet thick. But, as we trace them westwards, bed after bed thins out\r\nuntil, a little to the west of Ballintoy, in a distance of only about\r\n6 miles, the whole depth of the group has diminished to somewhere\r\nabout 40 feet. A decrease of more than 300 feet in six miles or 50\r\nfeet per mile points to considerable inequalities in the accumulation\r\nof the lavas. If the next series of flows came from another vent and\r\naccumulated against such a gentle slope, it would be marked by a slight\r\nunconformability. Structures of this kind are much rarer than we should\r\nexpect them to be, considering the great extent to which the plateaux\r\nhave been dissected and laid open in cliff-sections.\r\n\r\nThe basalt-plateau of the Faroe Islands exhibits with remarkable\r\nclearness the lenticular character of the basalt-sheets, and a number\r\nof examples will be cited in the description of that region to be\r\ngiven in Chapter xxxix. In these northern climes vegetation spreads\r\nless widely over rock and slope than it does in the milder air of the\r\nInner Hebrides. Hence the escarpments sweep in precipices of almost\r\nbare rock from the level of the sea up to the serrated crests of the\r\nislands, some 2000 feet in height. Each individual bed of basalt can\r\nthus be followed continuously along the fjords, and its variation\r\nor disappearance can be readily observed. Coasting along these vast\r\nnatural sections, we readily perceive that, as among the Western Isles,\r\nthe successive sheets of basalt have proceeded from no one common\r\ncentre of eruption. They die out now towards one quarter, now towards\r\nanother, yet everywhere retain the universal regularity and gentle\r\ninclinations of the whole volcanic series.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. FRAGMENTAL ROCKS\r\n\r\nWhile the plateaux are built up mainly of successive flows of basaltic\r\nlavas, they include various intercalations of fragmental materials,\r\nwhich, though of trifling thickness, are of great interest and\r\nimportance in regard to the light which they cast on the history of the\r\ndifferent regions during the volcanic period. I shall enumerate the\r\nchief varieties of these rocks here, and afterwards give fuller details\r\nregarding their stratigraphical relations and mode of occurrence in\r\nconnection with the succession of beds in each of the plateaux.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Volcanic Agglomerates._--In the tumultuous unstratified masses\r\nof fragmentary materials which fill eruptive vents in and around the\r\nplateaux, the stones, which vary in size up to blocks several feet in\r\ndiameter, consist for the most part of basalts, often highly slaggy and\r\nscoriaceous. They include also fragments of different acid eruptive\r\nrocks (generally felsitic or rhyolitic in texture), with pieces of\r\nthe non-volcanic rocks through which the volcanic pipes have been\r\ndrilled. The paste is granular, dirty-green or brown in colour, and\r\nseems generally to consist chiefly of comminuted basalt. As in the\r\nCarboniferous and Permian necks, the Tertiary agglomerates contain\r\nabundant detritus of a basic minutely cellular pumice.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Volcanic Conglomerates and Breccias in beds intercalated\r\nbetween the flows of Basalt._--These are of at least three kinds.\r\n(_a_) Basalt-conglomerates, composed mainly of rounded and subangular\r\nblocks of basalt (or allied basic lava), sometimes a yard or more\r\nin diameter, not unfrequently in the form of pieces of rough slag\r\nor even of true bombs, imbedded in a granular matrix of comminuted\r\nbasalt-debris. In some cases, the stones form by far the most abundant\r\nconstituents of the rock, which then resembles some of the coarse\r\nagglomerates just described. Perhaps the most remarkable accumulations\r\nof this kind are those intercalated among the basalts in the islands\r\nof Canna and Sanday, of which a detailed account will be given in\r\nChapter xxxviii. These conglomerates, besides their volcanic materials,\r\ncontain rounded blocks of Torridon sandstone and other rocks, which\r\nmust have been carried from the east by some tolerably powerful river\r\nthat flowed across the basalt-plains during the volcanic period.\r\nAgain, on the east side of Mull, the slaggy basalts of Beinn Chreagach\r\nMhor are occasionally separated by volcanic conglomerates. As a rule,\r\nhowever, such intercalations are seldom more than a few feet or yards\r\nin thickness. Their coarseness and repetition on successive horizons\r\nindicate that they probably accumulated in the near neighbourhood of\r\none or more small vents, from which discharges of fragmentary materials\r\ntook place at the beginning or at the close of an outflow of lava, and\r\nthat the stones were sometimes swept away from the cones and rolled\r\nabout by streams before being buried under the succeeding lava-sheets.\r\nMore commonly the dirty-green or dark-brown granular matrix exceeds in\r\nbulk the stones embedded in it. It has obviously been derived mainly\r\nfrom the trituration of already cooled basalt--masses, and probably\r\nalso from explosions of the still molten rock in the vents. A striking\r\nillustration of this type of rock may be seen on the south side of\r\nPortree Harbour, where a mass of dark-green basalt-conglomerate, with\r\na coaly layer above it, lies near the base of the bedded basalts, and\r\nattains at one part of its course a thickness of about 200 feet. This\r\nrock will be again referred to in connection with the vent from which\r\nits materials were probably derived. As in the case of the agglomerates\r\nof the vents, pieces of older acid lavas, and still more of the\r\nnon-volcanic rocks that underlie the plateaux, are found in the bedded\r\nconglomerates and breccias. In Antrim and Mull, for instance, fragments\r\nof flint and chalk are of common occurrence. A characteristic example\r\nof this kind of rock forms the platform of the columnar bed out of\r\nwhich Fingal's Cave, Staffa, has been excavated (Fig. 266_a_).\r\n\r\n([Greek: beta]) Felsitic Breccia.--This variety, though of rare\r\noccurrence, is to be seen in a number of localities in the island\r\nof Mull. It is composed in great measure of angular fragments of\r\nclose-grained flinty felsitic or rhyolitic rocks, sometimes showing\r\nbeautiful flow-structure, together with pieces of quartzite and\r\namygdaloidal basalt, the dull dirty-green matrix appearing to be made\r\nup chiefly of basalt-dust.\r\n\r\n([Greek: gamma]) Rhyolitic Conglomerate.--Between the upper and lower\r\ngroup of basalts in the Antrim plateau there occur bands of a pale\r\nfawn-coloured conglomerate largely made up of more or less rounded\r\nfragments of rhyolite, like some of the varieties of the rock which\r\noccur in place on the plateau. The rhyolitic debris is often mixed with\r\npebbles of basalt. Sometimes it becomes so fine as to pass into pale\r\nclays.\r\n\r\n([Greek: delta]) Breccias of non-volcanic materials.--These, the most\r\nexceptional of all the fragmentary intercalations in the plateaux,\r\nconsist almost wholly of angular blocks of rocks which are known\r\nto underlie the basalts, but with a variable admixture of basalt\r\nfragments. They are due to volcanic explosions which shattered the\r\nsubjacent older crust of rocks, and discharged fragments of these from\r\nthe vents or allowed them to be borne upwards on an ascending column\r\nof lava. Pieces of the non-volcanic platform are of common occurrence\r\namong the fragmentary accumulations, especially in the lower parts of\r\nthe plateaux basalts. But I have never seen so remarkable an example\r\nof a breccia of this kind as that which occurs near the summit of\r\nSgurr Dearg, in the south-east of Mull. The bedded basalt encloses a\r\nlenticular band of exceedingly coarse breccia, consisting mainly of\r\nangular pieces of quartzite, with fragments of amygdaloidal basalt.\r\nIn the midst of the breccia lies a huge mass or cake of erupted\r\nmica-schist, at least 100 yards long by 30 yards wide, as measured\r\nacross the strike up the slope of the hill. To the west, owing to\r\nthe thinning out of the breccia, this piece of schist comes to lie\r\nbetween two beds of basalt. A little higher up, other smaller but still\r\nlarge blocks of similar schist are involved in the basalt, as shown\r\nin Fig. 262. As the huge cake of mica-schist plunges into the hill,\r\nits whole dimensions cannot be seen; but there are visible, at least,\r\n15,000 cubic yards, which must weigh more than 30,000 tons. Blocks of\r\nquartzite of less dimensions occur in the basalts on Loch Spelve, in\r\nthe same district. There can be no doubt, I think, that these enormous\r\nfragments were torn off from the underlying crystalline schists which\r\nform the framework of the Western Highlands, and were floated upward\r\nin an ascending flow of molten basalt. Had the largest mass occurred\r\nat or near the base of the volcanic series, its size and position\r\nwould have been less remarkable. But it lies more than 2000 feet up\r\nin the basalts, and hence must have been borne upward for more than\r\nthat height. A similar but less striking breccia occurs on the south\r\ncoast of the same island, near Carsaig, made up chiefly of pieces of\r\nquartzite and quartz.[228]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: This is noticed by Mr. Starkie Gardner, _Quart. Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc._ xliii. (1887), p. 283, note.]\r\n\r\nSome remarkable agglomerates, near Forkhill, Armagh, probably belonging\r\nto the Tertiary volcanic series, will be described in the account\r\nof the Irish acid rocks (Chapter xlvii.). They consist entirely of\r\nnon-volcanic stones and dust and are traceable for some miles along the\r\nline of a fissure. Where they have been discharged through granite they\r\nconsist entirely of the detritus of that rock, but where they have been\r\nerupted in the Silurian area they consist of fragments of grits and\r\nshales. They seem to have been produced by æriform discharges, without\r\nthe uprise of any volcanic magma, though eventually andesite and\r\nrhyolite ascended the fissure and became full of granitic and Silurian\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\nSome remarkable necks filled almost entirely with fragments of Torridon\r\nSandstone have been observed in the west of Applecross, Ross-shire, and\r\nsome curious plug-like masses of breccia, also made up of fragments of\r\nTorridonian strata, occur in the island of Raasay. These examples will\r\nbe more particularly described on later pages (pp. 292, 293).\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Tuffs._--The tuffs intercalated in the basalt-plateaux generally\r\nconsist essentially of basic materials, derived from the destruction\r\nof different varieties of basalts, though also containing occasional\r\nfragments of older felsitic rocks, as well as pieces of chalk, flint,\r\nquartz, and other non-volcanic materials. They are generally dull,\r\ndirty-green in colour, but become red, lilac, brown, and yellow,\r\naccording to the amount and state of combination and oxidation of their\r\nferruginous constituents. They usually contain abundant fragments\r\nof amygdaloidal and other basalts. As a rule, they are distinctly\r\nstratified, and occur in bands from a few inches to 50 feet or more\r\nin thickness. The matrix being soft and much decomposed, these bands\r\ncrumble away under the action of the weather, and contribute to the\r\nabruptness of the basalt-escarpments that overlie them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 262.--Breccia and Blocks of mica-schist, quartzite,\r\netc., lying between bedded Basalts, Isle of Mull.\r\n\r\n_a a_, Bedded basalts; _b_, Breccia; _d_, Basic dyke.]\r\n\r\nIn the group of strata between the two series of basalts in Antrim,\r\nsome of the tuffs consist chiefly of rhyolitic detritus, both glassy\r\nand lithoid.\r\n\r\nWhere the tuffs become fine-grained and free from imbedded stones,\r\nthey pass into variously-coloured clays. Among these are the \"bauxite\"\r\nand \"lithomarge\" of Antrim, probably derived from pale rhyolitic tuffs\r\nand conglomerates (p. 204). Associated with these deposits in the same\r\ndistrict, is a pisolitic hæmatite, which has been proved to occur over\r\na considerable area on the same horizon. Many of the clays are highly\r\nferruginous. The red streaks that intervene between successive sheets\r\nof basalt are of this nature (bole, plinthite, etc.). The source of the\r\niron-oxide is doubtless to be traced to the decomposition of the basic\r\nlavas during the volcanic period.\r\n\r\n(_d_) There occur also grey and black clays and shales, of ordinary\r\nsedimentary materials, containing leaves of terrestrial plants\r\n(leaf-beds), with occasional wing-cases of beetles, sometimes\r\nassociated with impure limestones, but more frequently with sandstones\r\nand indurated gravels or conglomerates containing pieces of fossil\r\nwood. These intercalated bands undoubtedly indicate the action of\r\nrunning water, sometimes even of river-floods, and the accumulation of\r\nsediment in hollows of the exposed flows of basalt at intervals during\r\nthe piling up of the successive lava-sheets that form the plateaux.\r\nThe alternation of fluviatile gravels with volcanic tuffs, fluviatile\r\nconglomerates, and lava-streams, is admirably displayed in the island\r\nof Canna, as will be narrated in detail in Chapter xxxviii.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable matter has in some places gathered into lenticular seams\r\nof lignite, and even occasionally of black glossy coal. Amber also has\r\nbeen found in the lignite. Where the vegetation has been exposed to the\r\naction of intrusive dykes or sheets, it has sometimes passed into the\r\nstate of graphite.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable terrestrial flora found in the leaf-beds, and in\r\nassociation with the lignites, was first made known by the descriptions\r\nof Edward Forbes already referred to, and has subsequently been studied\r\nand described by Heer, W. H. Baily, and Mr. Starkie Gardner.[229] It\r\nwas regarded by Forbes as of Miocene age, and this view has generally\r\nbeen adopted by geologists. Mr. Starkie Gardner, however, contends\r\nthat it indicates a much wider range of geological time. He believes\r\nthat a succession of floras may be recognised, the oldest belonging\r\nto an early part of the Eocene period. Terrestrial plants, it must be\r\nadmitted, are not always a reliable test of geological age, and I am\r\nnot yet satisfied that in this instance they afford evidence of such\r\na chronological sequence as Mr. Gardner claims, though I am convinced\r\nthat the Tertiary volcanic period was long enough to have allowed\r\nof the development of considerable changes in the character of the\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: On this subject consult Duke of Argyll, _Quart. Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc._ vol. vii. (1851), p. 89; E. Forbes, _Ibid._ p. 103; W. H.\r\nBaily, _op. cit._ xxv. (1869), pp. 162, 357; _Brit. Assoc. Rep._ (1879)\r\np. 162; (1880) p. 107; (1881) p. 151; (1884) p. 209; Mr. J. Starkie\r\nGardner, _Palæontographical Society_, vols. xxxviii. xxxix. In the last\r\nof Mr. Baily's papers he notices that \"the Rev. Dr. Grainger found a\r\nportion of a fish (_Percidæ_, possibly _Lates_).\" The discovery of the\r\nremains of a fresh-water fish is an important additional testimony to\r\nthe terrestrial conditions under which the lavas were erupted. The\r\ngenus _Lates_ now inhabits the Nile and the Ganges.]\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of the present volume, however, the precise stage\r\nin the geological record, which this flora indicates, is of less\r\nconsequence than the broad fact that the plants prove beyond all\r\nquestion that the basalts among which they lie were erupted on land\r\nduring the older part of the long succession of Tertiary periods. Their\r\nvalue in this respect cannot be overestimated. Stratigraphical evidence\r\nshows that the eruptions must be later than the Upper Chalk; but the\r\nimbedded plants definitely limit them to the earlier half of Tertiary\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n       THE SEVERAL BASALT-PLATEAUX AND THEIR GEOLOGICAL HISTORY,\r\n                 ANTRIM, MULL, MORVEN AND ARDNAMURCHAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are five districts in North-western Europe where the original\r\nwidespread Tertiary lava-fields have been less extensively eroded\r\nthan elsewhere, or at least where they have survived in larger and\r\nthicker masses. Whether or not each of them was an isolated area of\r\nvolcanic activity cannot now be determined. Their several outflows of\r\nlava within the area of the British Isles may have united into one\r\ncontinuous volcanic tract, and their present isolation there may be due\r\nentirely to subterranean movements and denudation. There is a certain\r\nconvenience, however, in treating the districts separately. They\r\nare--1. Antrim; 2. Mull, Morven and Ardnamurchan; 3. Small Isles; 4.\r\nSkye; 5. The Faroe Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. ANTRIM[230]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230: The basalts of Antrim are the subject of an abundant\r\nliterature. I may refer particularly to the papers of Berger and\r\nConybeare (_Trans. Geol. Soc._ iii.), the Geological Report of\r\nPortlock, and the Explanations of the Sheets of the Geological Survey\r\nof Ireland. Other papers will be afterwards cited. The general features\r\nof the Antrim plateau are shown on Map VII.]\r\n\r\nThe largest of the basalt-plateaux of Britain is that which forms so\r\nprominent a feature in the scenery and geology of the North of Ireland,\r\nstretching from Lough Foyle to Belfast Lough, and from Rathlin Island\r\nto beyond the southern margin of Lough Neagh. Its area may be roughly\r\ncomputed at about 2000 square miles. But, as its truncated strata rise\r\nhigh along its borders, and look far over the surrounding low grounds,\r\nit must be regarded as a mere fragment of the original volcanic plain.\r\nIt may be described as an undulating tableland, which almost everywhere\r\nterminates in a range of bold cliffs, but which, towards the centre and\r\nsouth, sinks gently into the basin of Lough Neagh. The marginal line of\r\nescarpment, however, presents considerable irregularity both in height\r\nand form, besides being liable to frequent local interruptions. It is\r\nhighest on the west side, one of its crests reaching at Mullaghmore,\r\nin County Londonderry, a height of 1825 feet. It sinks down into the\r\nvalley of the Bann, east of which it gradually ascends, forming the\r\nwell-known range of cliffs from the Giant's Causeway and Bengore Head\r\nto Ballycastle. It then strikes inland, and making a wide curve in\r\nwhich it reaches a height of more than 1300 feet, comes to the sea\r\nagain at Garron Point. From that headland the cliffs of basalt form a\r\nbelt of picturesque ground southwards beyond Belfast, interrupted only\r\nby valleys that convey the drainage of the interior of the plateau\r\nto the North Channel. Above the valley of the Lagan the crest of the\r\nplateau rises to a height of more than 1500 feet.\r\n\r\nThroughout most of its extent the basalt-escarpment rests on the white\r\nlimestone or Chalk of Antrim, beneath which lie soft Lias shales and\r\nTriassic marls. Here and there, where the substratum of Chalk is thin,\r\nthe action of underground water on the crumbling shales and marls below\r\nit has given rise to landslips. The slopes beneath the base of the\r\nbasalt are strewn with slipped masses of that rock, almost all the way\r\nfrom Cushendall to Larne, some of the detached portions being so large\r\nas to be readily taken for parts of the unmoved rock. On the west side\r\nalso, a group of huge landslips cumbers the declivities beneath the\r\nmural front of Benevenagh.\r\n\r\nI have found some difficulty in the attempt to ascertain what was the\r\nprobable form of surface over which the volcanic rocks of this plateau\r\nbegan to be poured out. The Chalk sinks below the sea-level on the\r\nnorth coast, but, in the outlier of Slieve Gallion, three miles beyond\r\nthe western base of the escarpment, it rises to a height of 1500 feet\r\nabove the sea. On the east side also, it shows remarkable differences\r\nof level. Thus, below the White Head at the mouth of Belfast Lough,\r\nit passes under the sea-level, but only 16 miles to the south, where\r\nit crops out from under the basalt, its surface is about 1000 feet\r\nabove that level. If these variations in height existed at the time\r\nof the outpouring of the basalt, the surface of the ground over which\r\nthe eruptions took place was so irregular that some hundreds of feet\r\nof lava must have accumulated before the higher chalk hills were\r\nburied under the volcanic discharges. But it seems to me that much\r\nof this inequality in the height of the upper surface of the Chalk\r\nis to be attributed to unequal movements since the volcanic period,\r\nwhich involved the basalt in their effects, as well as the platform\r\nof Chalk below it. Had the present undulations of that platform been\r\nolder than the volcanic discharges, it is obvious that upper portions\r\nof the basalt-series would have overlapped lower, and would have come\r\nto rest directly on the Chalk. But this arrangement, so far as I am\r\naware, never occurs, except on a trifling scale. Wherever the Chalk\r\nappears, it is covered by sheets of the lower and not of the upper of\r\nthe two groups into which the Antrim basalts are divisible. We have\r\nactual proof of considerable terrestrial disturbance, subsequent to the\r\ndate of the formation of the volcanic plateau. Thus, near Ballycastle,\r\na fault lets down the basalt and its Chalk platform against the\r\ncrystalline schists of that district. On the east side of the fault,\r\nthe Chalk is found far up the slope, circling round the base of the\r\nbeautiful cone of Knocklayd--an outlier of the basalt which reaches a\r\nheight of 1695 feet (Fig. 263). The amount of vertical displacement of\r\nthe volcanic sheets is here 700 feet.[231] Many other displacements, as\r\nshown by the mapping of my colleagues in the Geological Survey, have\r\nshifted the base of the escarpment from a few inches up to several\r\nhundred feet. Besides actual dislocations, the Antrim plateau has\r\nundergone some marked subsidences of which the most notable is that of\r\nLough Neagh.[232]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 231: Explanatory Memoir of Sheets 7 and 8, Geological Survey,\r\nIreland, by Messrs. Symes, Egan, and M'Henry (1888), p. 37.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: These inequalities in the level of the base of the Antrim\r\nplateau will be more particularly discussed in Chapter xlix., in\r\nconnection with the subsidences and dislocations which have affected\r\nthe region since the close of the volcanic period.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that the present position of the Chalk\r\nplatform is far from agreeing with that which it presented to the\r\noutflow of the sheets of basalt. But, on the other hand, there can be\r\nno doubt that its surface at the beginning of the volcanic outbursts\r\nwas not a level plain. It was probably a rolling country of low bare\r\nchalk-downs, like parts of the South-east of England. The Irish Chalk\r\nattains its maximum thickness of perhaps 250 feet at Ballintoy. But it\r\nis liable to rapid diminution. On the shore at Ballycastle about 150\r\nfeet of it can be seen, its base being concealed; but only two and a\r\nhalf miles to the south, on the outlier of Knocklayd, the thickness is\r\nnot quite half so much. On the west side of the plateau also, there are\r\nrapid changes in the thickness of the Chalk. Such variations appear\r\nto be mainly attributable to unequal erosion before the overflow of\r\nthe basalts. So great indeed had been the denudation of the Cretaceous\r\nand underlying Secondary formations previous to the beginning of the\r\nvolcanic eruptions, that in some places the whole of these strata had\r\nbeen stripped off the country, so that the older platform of Palæozoic\r\nor still more ancient masses was laid bare. Thus, on the west side of\r\nthe escarpment, the basalt steals across the Chalk and comes to rest\r\ndirectly upon Lower Carboniferous rocks.\r\n\r\nThe authors who have described the junction of the Chalk and basalts in\r\nAntrim have generally referred to the uneven surface of the former rock\r\nas exposed in any given section. The floor on which the basalt lies is\r\nremarkably irregular, rising into ridges and sinking into hollows or\r\ntrenches, but almost everywhere presenting a layer of earthy rubbish\r\nmade of brown ferruginous clays, mixed with pieces of flint, chalk,\r\nand even basalt.[233] The flints are generally reddened and shattery.\r\nThe chalk itself has been described as indurated, and its flints as\r\npartially burned by the influence of the overlying basalt. But I have\r\nnot noticed, at any locality, evidence of alteration of the solid\r\nchalk, except where dykes or intrusive sheets have penetrated it.[234]\r\nThere can be no doubt that the hardness of the rock is an original\r\npeculiarity, due to the circumstances of its formation. The irregular\r\nearthy rubble, that almost always intervenes between the chalk and the\r\nbase of the basalt, like the \"clay with flints\" so general over the\r\nChalk of Southern England, no doubt represents long-continued subærial\r\nweathering previous to the outflow of the basalt. Even, therefore, if\r\nthere were no other evidence, we might infer with some confidence from\r\nthis layer of rubble, that the surface over which the lavas were poured\r\nwas a terrestrial one. Here and there, too, we may detect traces of\r\nthe subsidence of the basalt into swallow-holes dissolved in the chalk\r\nsubsequent to the outflow of the basalt-sheets.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: Portlock, _Report on Geology of Londonderry_, etc.\r\n(Geological Survey), p. 117.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 234: See Portlock, _op. cit._ p. 116.]\r\n\r\nThe Antrim plateau is not only the largest in the British Islands, it\r\nis also the most continuous and regular. It may be regarded, indeed,\r\nas one unbroken sheet of volcanic material, not disrupted by any such\r\nmountainous masses of intrusive rock as in the other plateaux interrupt\r\nthe continuity of the horizontal or gently inclined sheets of basalt.\r\nAround its margin, indeed, a few outliers tower above the plains, and\r\nserve as impressive memorials of its losses by denudation. Of these,\r\nby much the most picturesque and imposing, though not the loftiest, is\r\nKnocklayd already referred to, which forms so striking a feature in the\r\nnorth-east of Antrim (Fig. 263).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 263.--Section of Knocklayd, an outlier of the\r\nAntrim basalt-plateau lying on Chalk.\r\n\r\n1. Crystalline schists; 2. Cretaceous strata; 3. Lower basalts; 4.\r\nGroup of tuffs, clays and iron-ore; 5. Upper basalts; _f_. Fault.]\r\n\r\nThe total thickness of volcanic rocks in the Antrim plateau exceeds\r\n1000 feet; but, as the upper part of the series has been removed by\r\ndenudation, the whole depth of lava originally poured out cannot now be\r\ntold. A well-marked group of tuffs and clays, traceable throughout a\r\nlarge part of Antrim, forms a good horizon in the midst of the basalts,\r\nwhich are thus divisible into a lower and upper group (Fig 264).\r\n\r\nThe Lower Basalts have a thickness of from 400 to 500 feet. But,\r\nas already mentioned (p. 194), they die out in about six miles to\r\nno more than 40 feet at Ballintoy. They are distinguished by their\r\ngenerally cellular and amygdaloidal character, and less frequently\r\ncolumnar structure. The successive flows, each averaging perhaps above\r\n15 feet in thickness, are often separated by thin red ferruginous\r\nclayey partings, sometimes by bands of green or brown fine gravelly\r\ntuff. The most extensive of these tuff-bands occurs in the lower part\r\nof the group at Ballintoy, and can be traced along the coast for\r\nabout five miles. In the middle of its course, near the picturesque\r\nCarrick-a-raide, it reaches a maximum thickness of about 100 feet and\r\ngradually dies out to east and west. The neck of coarse agglomerate at\r\nCarrick-a-raide, is doubtless the vent from which this mass of tuff was\r\ndischarged (see Fig. 301). Owing to the thinning out of the sheets of\r\nbasalts, as they approach the vent, the tuff comes to rest directly on\r\nthe Chalk, and for some distance westwards forms the actual base of\r\nthe volcanic series.[235] Occasional seams of carbonaceous clays, or of\r\nlignite, appear in different horizons among the basalts. Beneath the\r\nwhole mass of basalt, indeed, remains of terrestrial vegetation here\r\nand there occur. Thus, near Banbridge, County Down, a patch of lignite,\r\nfour feet ten inches thick, underlies the basalt, and rests directly on\r\nSilurian rocks. Such fragmentary records are an interesting memorial\r\nof the wooded land-surface over which the earliest outflows of basalt\r\nspread.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 235: See Explanation of Sheets 7 and 8 of the Geological Survey\r\nof Ireland (1888), p. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 264.--Diagram-Section of the Antrim Plateau.\r\n\r\n1.

Upper group of basalts.]\r\n\r\nIn looking at the great basalt-escarpments of Antrim, the Inner\r\nHebrides or the Faroe Islands, and in following with the eye the\r\nsuccessive sheets of lava in orderly sequence of level bands from\r\nthe breaking waves at the base to the beetling crest above, we are\r\napt to take note only of the proofs of regularity and repetition\r\nin the outflows of molten rock and to miss the evidence that these\r\noutflows did not always rapidly follow each other, but were separated\r\nby intervals of varying, sometimes even of long duration. One of the\r\nmost frequent and conspicuous proofs of such intervals is to be found\r\nin the red layers or partings above referred to which, throughout all\r\nthe basalt-plateaux, so commonly intervene between successive sheets\r\nof basalt. These red streaks cannot fail to arrest the eye on the\r\ncoast-precipices where by their brilliant contrast of colour, they help\r\nto emphasize the bedded character of the whole volcanic series.\r\n\r\nExamined more closely, they are found to consist of clay or bole\r\nwhich shades into the decomposed top of the bed whereon it lies, and\r\nis usually somewhat sharply marked off from that which covers it.\r\nThis layer has long, and I think correctly, been regarded as due to\r\nthe atmospheric disintegration of the surface of the basalt on which\r\nit rests, before the eruption of the overlying flow. It varies in\r\nthickness from a mere line up to a foot or more, and it passes into the\r\ntuffs and clays which are sometimes interposed between the sheets of\r\nbasalts. It may be looked upon as probably furnishing evidence of the\r\nlapse of an interval sufficiently extended to permit a considerable\r\nsubserial decay of the surface of a lava-sheet before the outflow\r\nof the next lava. But an attentive study of the plateaux discloses\r\nother and even more remarkable indications that the pauses between\r\nthe consecutive basalt-beds were frequently so prolonged as to allow\r\nextensive topographical changes to be made in a district. Nowhere is\r\nthe long duration of some of these intervals more impressively taught\r\nthan in the central zone of sedimentary strata in Antrim.\r\n\r\nThis persistent group of tuffs, clays, and iron-ore is generally from\r\n30 to 40 and sometimes as much as 70 feet thick. From the occurrence\r\nof the ore in it, it has been explored more diligently in recent years\r\nthan any other group of rocks in the district, and its outcrop is now\r\nknown over most of the plateau. The iron-ore bed varies from less\r\nthan an inch up to 18 inches in thickness, and consists of pisolitic\r\nconcretions of hæmatite, from the size of a pea to that of a hazel\r\nnut, wrapped up in a soft ochreous clayey matrix.[236] Where it is\r\nabsent, its place is sometimes taken by an aluminous clay, worked as\r\n\"bauxite,\" which has yielded stumps of trees and numerous leaves and\r\ncones. Beneath the iron-ore or its representative, lies what is called\r\nthe \"pavement,\"--a ferruginous tuff, 8 to 10 feet thick, resting on\r\n\"lithomarge,\"--a lilac or violet mottled aluminous earth sometimes\r\nfull of rounded blocks or bombs of basalt. The well-known horizon for\r\nfossil plants at Ballypallidy is a red tuff in this zone. The section\r\nof strata between the two basalt-groups at this locality may serve as\r\nan illustration of the nature and arrangement of the deposits.[237]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 236: Consult a good essay on the Iron-ore and Basalts of\r\nNorth-east Ireland by Messrs. Tate and Holden, _Quart. Journ. Geol.\r\nSoc._ xxvi. (1870), p. 151. In this paper the nature, composition and\r\nmodes of origin of the iron-ore and its associated strata are fully\r\ndiscussed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: A. M'Henry, _Geol. Mag._ (1895), p. 263.]\r\n\r\n  Upper Basalt, compact and often columnar sheets.\r\n\r\n  Brown laminated tuff and volcanic clays.\r\n\r\n  Laminated brown impure earthy lignite, 2 feet 3 inches.\r\n\r\n  Brown and red variegated clays, tuffs and sandy layers, with irregular\r\n    seams of coarse conglomerate composed of rounded and subangular\r\n    fragments of rhyolite and basalt, 3 feet 4 inches.\r\n\r\n  Brown, red and yellowish laminated tuffs, mudstones, and bole, with\r\n    occasional layers of fine conglomerate (rhyolitic and basaltic),\r\n    pisolitic iron-ore band and plant-beds, 8 feet 10 inches.\r\n\r\n  Lower basalt, amygdaloidal.\r\n\r\nIn some of the Ballypallidy tuffs the most frequent lapilli are pieces\r\nof green and brown glass, which Mr. Watts compares with the pitchstone\r\nof Sandy Braes, though rarely containing phenocrysts as that rock does.\r\nHe has found also in these strata a smaller proportion of lithoidal\r\nrhyolites and occasionally fragments of basic rock.\r\n\r\nThe pale and coloured clays that occur in this marked sedimentary\r\nintercalation have doubtless been produced by the decomposition of\r\nthe volcanic rocks and the washing of their fine detritus by water.\r\nPossibly this decay may have been in part the result of solfataric\r\naction. From true bauxite or aluminium-hydrate, the sediments vary in\r\ncomposition and specific gravity and pass into aluminous silicates\r\nand iron-ores. They seem to indicate a prolonged interval of volcanic\r\nquiescence when the lavas and tuffs already erupted were denuded and\r\ndecomposed.[238]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: See a note on Bauxite by Professor G. A. Cole, _Scientif.\r\nTrans. Royal Dublin Soc._ vol. vi. series ii. (1896), p. 105.]\r\n\r\nThe area over which this interesting series of stratified deposits now\r\nextends is obviously much less than it was originally. It has indeed\r\nbeen so reduced by denudation into mere scattered patches that it\r\nprobably does not exceed 170 square miles. But the group can be traced\r\nfrom Divis Hill, near Belfast, to Rathlin Island, a distance of 50\r\nmiles, and from the valley of the Bann to the coast above Glenarm, more\r\nthan 20 miles. There can be little doubt that it was once continuous\r\nover all that area, and that it probably extended some way further on\r\neach side. If the so-called Pliocene clays of Lough Neagh be regarded\r\nas parts of this group of strata, its extent will be still further\r\nincreased. Hence the original area over which the iron-ore and its\r\naccompanying tuffs and clays were laid down can hardly have been less\r\nthan 1000 square miles. This extensive tract was evidently the site of\r\na lake during the volcanic period, formed by a subsidence of the floor\r\nof the lower basalts. The salts of iron contained in solution in the\r\nwater, whether derived from the decay of the surrounding lavas or from\r\nthe discharges of chalybeate springs, were precipitated as peroxide in\r\npisolitic form, as similar ores are now being formed on lake-bottoms\r\nin Sweden. For a long interval, quiet sedimentation went on in this\r\nlake, the only sign of volcanic energy during that time being the dust\r\nand stones that were thrown out and fell over the water-basin, or were\r\nwashed into it by rains from the cones of the lava-slopes around.\r\n\r\nIt may here be remarked that the tendency to subsidence in the Antrim\r\nplateau seems to have characterized this region since an early part\r\nof the volcanic period. The lake in which the deposits now described\r\naccumulated was entirely effaced and overspread by the thick group\r\nof upper basalts. But long after the eruptions had ceased, a renewed\r\nsinking of the ground gave rise to the sheet of water which now forms\r\nLough Neagh.[239]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: This subject will be discussed in Chapter xlix.]\r\n\r\nNowhere else among the Tertiary basalt-plateaux of Britain has any\r\ntrace been found of so marked and prolonged a pause in the volcanic\r\nactivity as is indicated by the Antrim zone of tuffs and clays.\r\nThroughout the Inner Hebrides, indeed, numerous intercalations of\r\nsedimentary material occur among the basalts, but these consist\r\nmainly of tuffs and volcanic conglomerates with less frequent shales\r\nand coal-seams, and they never suggest so distinct and lengthened an\r\ninterval as is indicated by the Antrim deposit.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that this interval was marked by the outbreak\r\nof rhyolitic eruptions somewhere in the region. The abundance of\r\nrhyolite fragments in some of the tuffs is striking evidence that\r\nacid rocks were in one way or other brought to the surface at this\r\ntime. At Glenarm one of the members of the stratified series is a\r\nmarked rhyolitic conglomerate, composed of rounded pebbles of a rock\r\nnot unlike the well-known rhyolite of Tardree and Carnearny. These\r\nfragments, obviously of local origin, must either have been derived\r\nfrom a surface of acid rock laid bare by denudation, or from rhyolite\r\nejected in lapilli or poured out in streams. I formerly believed that\r\nall the Antrim rhyolites had been injected into the basalts after the\r\nclose of the plateau-period. But the proved abundance and wide extent\r\nof the rhyolitic detritus among the sediments associated with the\r\niron-ore point to a possible outflow of acid lavas with accompanying\r\ntuffs during the sedimentary interval between the two groups of\r\nbasalt. The characters of the Antrim rhyolites, however, will be more\r\nparticularly discussed in Chapter xlvii., in connection with the acid\r\nrocks of the Tertiary volcanic series.\r\n\r\nImmediately above the iron-ore of Antrim, or separated from it in\r\nplaces by only a few inches of tuff, comes the group of Upper Basalts,\r\nwhich varies up to 600 feet in thickness, though as the upper portion\r\nhas been everywhere removed by denudation, no measure remains of what\r\nmay have been the original depth of the group. The general character\r\nof these basalts is more frequently columnar, black and compact, and\r\nwith fewer examples of a strongly amygdaloidal structure than in the\r\nlower group. But this distinction is less marked in the south than in\r\nthe north of Antrim, so that where the intervening zone of tuffs and\r\niron-ore disappears, no satisfactory line of division can be traced\r\nbetween the two groups of basalt. The occurrence of that zone, however,\r\nby giving rise to a hollow or slope, from which the upper basalts rise\r\nas a steep bank or cliff, furnishes a convenient topographical feature\r\nfor mapping the boundary of these rocks. Among the upper basalts, also,\r\nthere is perhaps a less frequent occurrence of those thin red partings\r\nof bole between successive flows, so conspicuous in the lower group.\r\nBut the flows are not less distinctly marked off from each other.\r\nNowhere can their characteristic features be better seen than along the\r\nmagnificent range of cliffs from the Giant's Causeway eastwards. The\r\ncolumnar bed that forms the Causeway is the lowest sheet of the upper\r\ngroup, and may be seen resting directly on the zone of grey and red\r\ntuffs. It is about 60 or 70 feet thick; and, while perfectly regular in\r\nits columnar structure at the Causeway and the \"Organ,\" assumes further\r\neastward the confusedly starch-like arrangement of prisms already\r\nreferred to. But in the great cliff section of the \"Amphitheatre,\"\r\nthe more regular structure is resumed, the bed swells out to about\r\n80 feet in thickness, and columns of that length run up the face\r\nof the precipice, weathering out at the top into separate pillars,\r\nwhich, perched on the crest of an outstanding ridge, are known as the\r\n\"Chimneys.\" The basalt-beds that succeed the lowest one are each only\r\nabout 10 to 15 feet thick (Fig. 265).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 265.--View of Basalt escarpment, Giant's Causeway,\r\nwith the Amphitheatre and Chimneys. (From a photograph by Mr. R.\r\nWelch.)]\r\n\r\nBetween the successive sheets of the Upper Basalts thin seams of red\r\nferruginous clay though, as I have said, less frequent perhaps than in\r\nthe lower group, continue to show that the intervals between successive\r\neruptions were of sufficient duration to admit of some subærial decay\r\nof the surface of a lava before the outflow of the next bed. Occasional\r\nthin layers of tuff also, and even of pisolitic iron-ore, have been\r\nobserved among these higher basalts. But the most interesting and\r\nimportant intercalations are inconstant seams of lignite. One of the\r\nmost conspicuous of these lies immediately above the basalt of the\r\n\"Causeway,\" where it was long worked for fuel, and was found to be\r\nmore than six feet thick. But it is quite local, as may be seen at the\r\n\"Organ\" over which it lies, having a thickness of only 12 inches and\r\nrapidly dying out so as to allow the basalts above and below it to come\r\ntogether. The removal of the upper portion of the basalts by denudation\r\nhas destroyed the records of the latest part of the volcanic history of\r\nthe Irish plateaux.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that nowhere in Antrim does any trace exist of a central\r\nvent or cone from which the volcanic materials were discharged. There\r\nis no perceptible thickening of the individual basalt-sheets, nor of\r\nthe whole series in one general direction, in such a manner as to\r\npoint to the site of some chief focus of eruption. Nor can we place\r\nreliance on the inclination of the several parts of the plateau. I have\r\npointed out that the varying dip of the beds must be attributed mainly\r\nto post-volcanic movements, or at least to movements which, if not\r\nlater than all the phases of volcanic action, must have succeeded the\r\noutpouring of the plateau-basalts. There has been a general subsidence\r\ntowards the central and southern tracts now occupied by the valley of\r\nthe Bann and Lough Neagh. But nowhere in the depression is there any\r\ntrace of the ruins of a central cone or focus of discharge.\r\n\r\nThe Antrim plateau, in these respects, resembles the others. But as\r\nhas already been remarked, it differs from them in one important\r\nparticular. It has nowhere been disrupted by huge bosses of younger\r\nrocks, such as have broken up the continuity of the old lava-fields\r\nfurther north. Yet it also is not without its memorials of younger\r\nprotrusions. It contains not a few excellent examples of true volcanic\r\nvents, and, as above stated, it includes some small acid bosses that\r\nmay represent the great protrusions of the Inner Hebrides, and may have\r\nbeen connected with superficial outflows of rhyolitic lava and showers\r\nof rhyolitic tuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. MULL, MORVEN AND ARDNAMURCHAN\r\n\r\nThis plateau covers nearly the whole of the island of Mull, embraces a\r\nportion of Morven on the Argyleshire mainland, and, stretching across\r\nLoch Sunart, includes the western part of the peninsula of Ardnamurchan\r\n(Map VI.). That these now disconnected areas were once united into a\r\ncontinuous lava-field which extended far beyond its present limits\r\nis impressively indicated by their margin of cliffs and fringe of\r\nscattered islands and outliers. The plateau went west, at least, as far\r\nas the Treshnish Isles, which are composed of basalt. On its eastern\r\nborder, a capping of basalt on the top of Beinn Iadain (1873 feet) in\r\nMorven, and others further north, prove that its volcanic sheets once\r\nspread into the interior of Argyleshire (Fig. 266). On the south, its\r\nfine range of lofty cliffs, with their horizontal bars of basalt, bear\r\nwitness to the diminution which it has undergone on that side; while,\r\non the north, similar sea-walls tell the same tale. Not only has it\r\nsuffered by waste along its margin, it has also been deeply trenched\r\nby the excavation of glens and arms of the sea. The Sound of Mull\r\ncuts it in two, and the mainland portion is further bisected by Loch\r\nSunart, and again by Loch Aline. The island of Mull is so penetrated\r\nby sea-lochs and divided by deep valleys that a comparatively slight\r\ndepression would turn it into a group of islands. But, besides its\r\nenormous denudation, this plateau has been subjected to disruption,\r\nand perhaps also to subsidence, from subterranean movements. In the\r\nsouthern portion of the island of Mull it has been broken up by the\r\nintrusion of large bosses and sheets of gabbro, and by masses as\r\nwell as innumerable veins of various granitoid and felsitic rocks.\r\nIn Ardnamurchan, it has suffered so much disturbance from the same\r\ncause that its original structure has been almost obliterated over a\r\nconsiderable area. Moreover, it has been dislocated by many faults,\r\nby which different portions have been greatly shifted in level. The\r\nmost important of these breaks is one noticed by Professor Judd, and\r\nvisible to every tourist who sails up the Sound of Mull. It traverses\r\nthe cliffs on the Morven side, opposite Craignure, bringing the basalts\r\nagainst the crystalline schists, and strikes thence inland, wheeling\r\nround into the long valley in which Lochs Arienas and Teacus lie.\r\nOn its western side, the base of the basalt-series is almost at the\r\nsea-level; on its eastern side, that platform rises high into the\r\noutliers of Beinn na h-Uamha (1521 feet) and Beinn Iadain. The amount\r\nof displacement is probably more than 1000 feet. Many other minor\r\nfaults in the same district show how much the crust of the earth has\r\nbeen fractured here since older Tertiary time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 266.--Basalt-capping on top of Beinn Iadain, Morven.\r\n\r\nThe hummocky ground to the right consists of the Highland schists\r\nagainst which the basalts are brought by lines of dislocation.[240]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 240: There are no fewer than three faults in the basalt-capping\r\non the summit of Beinn Iadain. By bringing the basalts and schists into\r\njuxtaposition, they have given rise to topographical features that can\r\nbe seen even from a distance.]\r\n\r\nA little to the west of Mull, and belonging originally to the same\r\nplateau, lies the isle of Staffa, the famous columnar basalts of which\r\nfirst attracted the attention of travellers, and gave to the Tertiary\r\nvolcanic rocks of Scotland their celebrity (Fig. 266_a_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 266_a_.--View of the south side of Staffa, showing the bedded\r\n  and columnar structure of the basalt. The rock in which the cave to\r\n  the left hand has been eroded is a conglomeratic tuff underlying\r\n  the basalt; to the right is Fingal's Cave. These caverns bear\r\n  witness to the enormous erosive power of the Atlantic breakers.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the extent to which it has suffered from denudation and\r\nsubterranean disturbance, and indeed in consequence thereof, the Mull\r\nplateau presents clear sections of many features in the history of\r\nthe basalt-outflows and of the subsequent phases of Tertiary volcanic\r\naction which cannot be seen in the more regular and continuous\r\ntableland of Antrim. Moreover, it still possesses in its highest\r\nmountain, Ben More (3169 feet), a greater thickness, and probably\r\na higher series, of lavas than can now be seen in any other of the\r\nplateaux.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties, already referred to in regard to Antrim, of tracing\r\nthe probable form of ground on which the volcanic eruptions began, are\r\neven greater in the case of the Mull plateau. We can dimly perceive\r\nthat the depression in the crystalline rocks of the Highlands which\r\nhad, from at least the older part of the Jurassic period, stretched in\r\na N.N.W. direction along what is now the western margin of Argyleshire,\r\nlay beneath the sea in Jurassic time, and was then more or less filled\r\nup with sedimentary deposits. The hollow appears thereafter to have\r\nbecome a land-valley, whence the Jurassic strata were to a large extent\r\ncleared out by denudation before its subsequent submergence under the\r\nsea in which the upper Cretaceous deposits accumulated. Professor\r\nJudd has shown that relics of these Cretaceous strata appear on both\r\nsides of the plateau from under the protecting cover of basalt-sheets.\r\nBut, before the volcanic eruptions began, the area had once again\r\nbeen raised into land, and the youngest Secondary formations had been\r\nextensively eroded.\r\n\r\nIn their general aspect the basalts of Mull agree with those of\r\nAntrim, and the circumstances under which they were erupted were no\r\ndoubt essentially the same. But considerable differences in detail are\r\nobservable between the succession of rocks in the two areas. When I\r\nfirst visited the island in 1866, the only available maps, with any\r\npretensions to accuracy, were the Admiralty charts; but, as these do\r\nnot give the interior except in a generalized way, it was difficult\r\nto plot sections from them, and to arrive at satisfactory conclusions\r\nas to the thickness of different groups of rock. Accordingly, as the\r\nsuccessive nearly flat flows of basalt can be traced from the sea-level\r\nup to the top of Ben More, I contented myself with the fact that the\r\ntotal depth of lava-beds in Mull was at least equal to the height of\r\nthat mountain, or 3169 feet. The publication of the Ordnance Survey\r\nMaps now enables us to make a nearer approximation to the truth. From\r\nthe western base of the magnificent headland of Gribon, the basalts in\r\nalmost horizontal beds rise in one vast sweep of precipice and terraced\r\nslope to a height of over 1600 feet, and then stretch eastwards to\r\npass under the higher part of Ben More, at a distance of some eight\r\nmiles. They have a slight easterly inclination, so that the basement\r\nsheets seen at the sea-level, at the mouth of Loch Scridain, gradually\r\nsink below that level as they go eastward. It is not easy to get a\r\nmeasurement of dip among these basalts, except from a distance. If we\r\ntake the inclination at only 1°, the beds which are at the base of the\r\ncliff on the west, must be about 700 feet below the sea on the line\r\nof Ben More, which would give a total thickness of nearly 3900 feet\r\nof bedded lava below the top of that mountain. We shall not probably\r\noverestimate the thickness of the Mull plateau if we put it at 3500\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe base of the volcanic series of Mull can best be seen on the\r\nsouth coast at Carsaig, and at the foot of the precipices of Gribon.\r\nAs already stated, it is there found resting above Cretaceous and\r\nJurassic rocks. The lowest beds are basalt-tuffs, of the usual dull\r\ngreen colour. They are in places much intermingled with sandy and\r\ngravelly sediment, as if the volcanic debris had fallen into water\r\nwhere such sediment was in course of deposition. One of the most\r\ninteresting features, indeed, in this basement part of the series, is\r\nthe occurrence of bands of non-volcanic material which accumulated\r\nafter the tuffs and some of the lavas had been erupted, but before the\r\nmain mass of basalts. Those at Carsaig include a lenticular bed, 25\r\nfeet thick, of rolled flints, which, with some associated sandy bands,\r\nlies between sheets of basalt. On the opposite side of the promontory\r\nis the well-known locality of Ardtun, from which the first land-plants\r\nin the volcanic series were determined. The actual base of the basalts\r\nis not there seen, being covered by the sea. The \"leaf-beds,\" with\r\ntheir accompanying sandstones, gravels, and limestone, lie upon a\r\nsheet of basalt, which in some parts is exceedingly slaggy on the\r\ntop, passing down into a black compact structure, and assuming at\r\nthe base of the cliff a columnar arrangement, with the prisms curved\r\nand built up endways towards each other. Some of the gravels exceed\r\n30 feet in thickness, and consist of rolled flints, bits of chalk,\r\nand pieces of basalt and other basic igneous rocks. But some of\r\ntheir most interesting ingredients are pebbles of sanidine lavas,\r\nwhich have been recognized in them by Prof. G. Cole.[241] No known\r\nprotrusions of such lavas occur anywhere beneath or interstratified\r\nwith the plateau-basalts of this district. As will be afterwards\r\nshown, all the visible acid rocks, the geological relations of which\r\ncan be ascertained, are here of younger date than these basalts. I am\r\ndisposed to regard the fragments found in the Ardtun conglomerates as\r\nprobably derived from some of the basalt-conglomerates of the plateau,\r\nin which fragments of siliceous igneous rocks do occur. Though there\r\nis no evidence that any lavas of that nature were here poured out at\r\nthe surface before or during the emission of the basalts, the contents\r\nof these fragmental volcanic accumulations suggest that such lavas,\r\nalready consolidated, lay at some depth beneath the surface, and that\r\nfragments were torn off from them during the explosions that threw out\r\nthe materials of the basalt-conglomerates to the surface.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 241: _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ xliii. (1887) p. 277.]\r\n\r\nThe succession of strata at the Ardtun headland varies considerably in\r\na short distance, some of the sedimentary deposits rapidly increasing\r\nor diminishing in thickness. The section as measured by Mr. Starkie\r\nGardner is as follows[242]:--\r\n\r\n  Columnar basalt, 40 feet.\r\n  Position of first leaf-bed, obscured by grass, about 2 feet.\r\n  Gravel varying from about 25 feet to a maximum of nearly 40 feet.\r\n  Black or second leaf-bed, 2-1/2 feet.\r\n  Gravel about 7 feet.\r\n  Grey clay, 2 feet.\r\n  Laminated sandstone, 6 inches, with 3 inches of fine limestone,\r\n    containing leaves at the base.\r\n  Clay, with leaves at base, 1 foot.\r\n  Clunch, with rootlets, 7 inches.\r\n  Amorphous basalt, becoming columnar at base, about 60 feet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 242: _Op. cit._ p. 280.]\r\n\r\nMr. Starkie Gardner has called attention to the extraordinarily fresh\r\ncondition of the vegetation in some of the layers of the Ardtun\r\nsection. One of the leaf-beds he has found to be made up for an inch or\r\ntwo of a pressed mass of leaves, lying layer upon layer, and retaining\r\nalmost the colours of dead vegetation. Among the plants represented is\r\na large purple _Ginkgo_ and a fine _Platanites_, one leaf measuring\r\n15-1/2 inches long by 10-1/2 broad. The characteristic dicotyledonous\r\nleaves at this locality possessed relatively large foliage.[243]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 243: For fuller local details regarding the Ardtun leaf-beds,\r\nI may refer to the original paper by the Duke of Argyll (_Quart. Jour.\r\nGeol. Soc._ vii. p. 89), and to the memoir by Mr. Starkie Gardner (_op.\r\ncit._ xliii. (1887), p. 270).]\r\n\r\nTo the early observations of Macculloch we are indebted for the\r\nrecord of an interesting fact in connection with the vegetation of\r\nthe land-surface over which the first lava-flows spread. He figured a\r\nvertical tree trunk, imbedded in prismatic basalt, and rightly referred\r\nit to some species of fir.[244] This relic may still be seen under the\r\nbasalt precipices of Gribon. Mr. Gardner found it to be \"a large trunk\r\nof a coniferous tree, five feet in diameter, perhaps _Podocarpus_,\r\nwhich has been enveloped, as it stood, in one of the flows of trap to\r\nthe height of 40 feet. Its solidity and girth evidently enabled it to\r\nresist the fire, but it had decayed before the next flow passed over\r\nit, for its trunk is a hollow cylinder filled with debris, and lined\r\nwith the charred wood. A limb of another, or perhaps the same tree, is\r\nin a fissure not far off.\"[245]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 244: _Western Islands_, vol. i. p. 568, and plate xxi. Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 245: _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ xliii. p. 283.]\r\n\r\nAt different levels in the volcanic series of Mull, beds of lignite and\r\neven true coal are observable. These seem to be always mere lenticular\r\npatches, only a few square yards in extent. The best example I have\r\nmet with lies among the basalts near Carsaig. It is in part a black\r\nglossy coal, and partly dull and shaly. Some years ago it was between\r\ntwo and three feet thick, but now, owing to its having been dug away by\r\nthe shepherds, only some six or eight inches are to be seen. It lies\r\nbetween two basalt-flows, and rapidly disappears on either side.\r\n\r\nMore frequent than these inconstant layers of fossil vegetation are\r\nthe thin partings of tuff and layers of red clay, sometimes containing\r\niron-ore, which occur at intervals throughout the series between\r\ndifferent flows of basalt. But even such intercalations are of trifling\r\nthickness, and only of limited extent. The magnificent precipices of\r\nM'Gorry's Head and Gribon expose a succession of beds of columnar\r\namorphous and amygdaloidal basalt, which must attain a thickness of at\r\nleast 2500 feet, before they are overlain by the higher group of pale\r\nlavas in Ben More. On the east side of the island, thin tuffs and bands\r\nof basalt-conglomerate occur on different horizons among the bedded\r\nbasalts, from near the sea-level up to the summit of the ridge which\r\nculminates in Beinn Meadhon (2087 feet), Dùn-da-Ghaoithe (2512 feet),\r\nand Mainnir-nam-Fiadh (2483 feet). Reference has already been made to\r\nthe remarkably coarse character of some of the breccias intercalated\r\namong the basalts in this part of Mull, and to the enormous dimensions\r\nof some of the masses of mica-schist and quartzite which have been\r\ncarried up from a depth of 2000 feet or more by volcanic agency (see\r\n_ante_, p. 196, and Fig. 262).\r\n\r\nAbove the ordinary compact and amygdaloidal basalt comes the higher\r\ngroup of pale lavas already referred to as forming the uppermost\r\npart of Ben More, whence it stretches continuously along the pointed\r\nridge of A'Chioch, and thence northwards into Beinn Fhada. The same\r\nlavas are likewise found in two outliers, capping Beinn a' Chraig,\r\na mile further north, and I have found fragments of them on some of\r\nthe loftier ridges to the south-east. This highest and youngest group\r\nof lavas in the plateaux has been reduced to mere isolated patches,\r\nand a little further denudation will remove it altogether. Yet it is\r\nnot less than about 800 feet thick, and consists of bedded andesitic\r\nor trachytic lavas, which alternate with and follow continuously\r\nand conformably upon the top of the ordinary plateau-basalts. These\r\ndull, finely crystalline or compact, light-grey rocks weather with a\r\ncharacteristic platy form, which has been mistaken for the bedding\r\nof tuffs. The fissility, however, has none of the regularity or\r\nparallelism of true bedding, and may be observed to run sometimes\r\nparallel with the bedding of the sheets, sometimes obliquely or even\r\nat right angles to it. Even where this structure is best developed,\r\nthe truly crystalline nature of the rocks can readily be detected.\r\nSome of them are porphyritic and amygdaloidal, the very topmost bed\r\nof the mountain being a coarse amygdaloid. Intercalated with these\r\ncurious rocks there are others in which the ordinary characters of\r\nthe dolerites and basalts of the plateaux can be recognised. The\r\namygdaloids are often full of delicate prisms of epidote.\r\n\r\nIn Mull, as in the other areas of terraced basalts, we everywhere meet\r\nwith gently inclined sheets, which do not thicken out individually or\r\ncollectively in any given direction, except as the result of unequal\r\ndenudations. So far as I have been able to discover, they afford\r\nno evidence of any great volcanic cone from which they proceeded.\r\nTheir present inclinations are unquestionably due, as in Ireland, to\r\nmovements subsequent to the formation of the plateau. In Loch-na-keal\r\nthey dip gently to the E.N.E.; in Ulva and the north-west coast to\r\nN.N.E.; near Salen to W.S.W. on the one side, and N.W. on the other.\r\nRound the southern and eastern margins of the mountainous tract of the\r\nisland, they dip generally inwards to the high grounds.\r\n\r\nThe Mull plateau presents a striking contrast to that of Antrim, in\r\nthe extraordinary extent to which it has been disrupted by later\r\nprotrusions of massive basic and acid rocks over a rudely circular\r\narea, extending from the head of Loch Scridain to the Sound of Mull,\r\nand from Loch-na-keal to Loch Buy. The bedded basalts have been invaded\r\nby masses of dolerite, gabbro, and granophyre, with various allied\r\nkinds of rock. They have not only been disturbed in their continuity,\r\nbut have undergone considerable metamorphism.\r\n\r\nAgain, further to the north, in the promontory of Ardnamurchan,\r\nthe plateau has been disrupted in a similar way, and only a few\r\nrecognisable fragments of it have been left. These changes will be more\r\nappropriately discussed in connection with similar phenomena in the\r\nother plateaux further north.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n      THE BASALT-PLATEAU OF THE PARISH OF SMALL ISLES--RIVERS OF\r\n                          THE VOLCANIC PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\n                  iii. PARISH OF SMALL ISLES PLATEAU\r\n\r\nThe parish of Small Isles includes the islands of Eigg, Rum, Canna,\r\nSanday and Muck (Map VI.). The fragmentary basalt-plateau which it\r\ncontains, although the smallest of the whole series, is surpassed by\r\nnone in the variety and interest of its geology. It contains by far the\r\nmost complete records of the rivers which, during the volcanic period,\r\nflowed across the lava plains. And it alone has preserved a relic of\r\nthe latest lava which, after the basalt-plateau had been built up and\r\nhad been greatly eroded, flowed over the denuded surface in streams of\r\nvolcanic-glass that found their way into a river-channel and sealed it\r\nup.\r\n\r\nThat the fragments of the basaltic plateau preserved in each member\r\nof the group of the Small Isles were once connected as a continuous\r\nvolcanic plain can hardly be doubted. Indeed, as already stated, they\r\nwere not improbably united with the plateau of Skye on the north, and\r\nwith that of Mull, Morven and Ardnamurchan oh the south. Taking the\r\nwhole space of land and sea within which the basalt of Small Isles\r\nis now confined, we may compute it at not much less than 200 square\r\nmiles. In Eigg, Muck, Canna and Sanday the basalts retain their almost\r\nhorizontal position, and from underneath them the Jurassic strata\r\nemerge in the first of these islands. The central part of the plateau\r\nin the island of Rum has suffered greatly from denudation. It now\r\nconsists of four small outliers of basalt, which lie at levels of\r\n1200 feet and upwards, on the western slope. The basalt is underlain\r\nby a thick mass of red Torridon Sandstone, which, with some gneisses\r\nand schists, forms the general underlying platform of this island.\r\nThese rocks are doubtless a continuation of the red sandstone and\r\nschists of Sleat, in Skye, and like them have been subjected to those\r\npost-Cambrian convolutions and metamorphism whereby the Lewisian\r\nGneiss and Torridon Sandstone have been brought above younger rocks,\r\nand have been crushed and rolled out so as to assume a new schistose\r\narrangement. Before the time when volcanic action began, a mass of high\r\nground, consisting of these ancient rocks, stood where the island of\r\nRum is now situated. The streams of basalt spread around it, not only\r\ncovering the surrounding low tracts of Jurassic rocks, but gradually\r\naccumulating against the hills, and thus reducing them both in area\r\nand in height above the plain.[246] Viewed from Canna the western coast\r\nof Rum presents a striking picture of the general relations of the\r\nvolcanic masses of the Inner Hebrides and of the enormous denudation\r\nwhich they have undergone (Fig. 267). The Torridon Sandstones are\r\nthere seen to mount into ranges of hills, capped with outliers of\r\nthe basalt-plateau, while behind rise the great eruptive bosses of\r\ngabbro and granophyre. The edges of the sheets that form the outliers\r\nwould, if prolonged, cover the northern or lower half of the island,\r\nwhere pre-Cambrian rocks form the surface. In the southern half,\r\nthe continuity of the basalt has been partly obscured and partly\r\ndestroyed by the protrusion of the great masses of gabbro that form the\r\nsingularly picturesque mountain group to which this island owes its\r\nprominence as a landmark far and wide along the West Coast of Scotland.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 246: That the lava-fields did not completely bury this nucleus\r\nof older rocks has been supposed to be shown by the fragments of red\r\nsandstone found in the ancient river-bed of Eigg, which was scooped\r\nout of the basalt-plateau and sealed up under pitchstone. But I am\r\ndisposed to think that these fragments, together with those of Jurassic\r\nsandstone, came, not from Rum, but from some district more to the north\r\nand east, as will be explained in a later page. At Canna, a few miles\r\nto the west, fragments of red sandstone not improbably derived from Rum\r\nare abundant in the conglomerates between the basalts.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 267.--View of Rum from the harbour of Canna.\r\n\r\nThe ground indicated by single birds is the area of Torridon Sandstone;\r\ntwo birds, the plateau basalts; three birds, the gabbro just seen at\r\none point above the granophyre hills; four birds, the granophyre.]\r\n\r\nThe most varied and interesting of the fragments of the basaltic\r\nplateau in the area of the Small Isles is that which forms the island\r\nof Canna, with its appendage Sanday. Canna measures five miles in\r\nlength by from half a mile to a mile in breadth, and consists entirely\r\nof the rocks of the plateau and their accompaniments. The basalts are\r\nexposed along the north coast in a range of mural precipices rising\r\nto a height of about 600 feet above the sea. From the top of that\r\nescarpment the ground falls by successive rocky terraces and grassy\r\nslopes to the southern shore-line. Sanday, connected with the large\r\nisland by a shoal and foot-bridge, is two miles long and 220 to about\r\n1200 yards broad. Its highest cliffs range along its southern shore\r\nto a height of 193 feet, whence they slope gently northward into the\r\nhollow between the two islands. This peculiar topography accounts\r\nfor the manner in which the geological sections of most interest are\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\nThe first, and still the best, account of the geology of these islands\r\nis that of Macculloch. He showed that the rocks all belong to the\r\nseries of the plateau-basalts, and he described the presence among them\r\nof a \"trap-conglomerate.\" He noticed the occurrence also of trap-tuff\r\nand the occasional appearance of carbonized wood in these deposits.\r\nReasoning upon these observations in his characteristically vague and\r\nverbose manner, \"bewildered in the regions of conjecture,\" he concludes\r\nthat the basalts instead of belonging to \"one general formation\" have\r\nbeen successively deposited on the same spot, \"since lapse of time is\r\nevidently implied in the formation of a conglomerate.\" He inclines to\r\nbelieve that they have been discharged by ancient volcanoes from which\r\nin the course of time all traces of their original outline have been\r\nmore or less completely removed, the existing basalts being merely\r\nfragments of once more extensive masses.[247]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 247: _Western Isles_, vol. i. pp. 448-459, and pl. xix. Figs.\r\n2, 3 and 4. See also Jameson's _Mineralogy of the Scottish Isles_.]\r\n\r\nMacculloch regarded the intercalated-conglomerates as having been\r\narranged under water and as marking pauses in the deposition of the\r\nsheets of \"trap.\" He gave two diagrams in illustration of the relations\r\nof these detrital deposits, but he expressed no definite opinion as to\r\ntheir origin, though from one passage it would seem that he inclined\r\ntowards the belief that they were formed in the sea.[248] Since his time,\r\nso far as I am aware, no fresh light has been thrown upon the subject.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 248: _Op. cit._ pp. 449, 457, pl. xix. Figs. 2 and 3.]\r\n\r\nDuring a yachting cruise in the summer of 1894 I visited Canna for\r\nthe first time and found so much that was new to me in regard to the\r\nhistory of Tertiary volcanic action, and which demanded a careful\r\nsurvey, that I returned to the locality the following summer and\r\nremained in the island until I had mapped it and its dependencies upon\r\nthe Ordnance Survey sheets on the scale of six inches to a mile. The\r\nfollowing narrative is the result of the observations then made.\r\n\r\nAs far back as the year 1865 I published an account of an ancient\r\nriver-channel which, during the volcanic period, had been eroded on the\r\nsurface of the basalt-plateau, and of which a small portion had been\r\npreserved under a stream of pitchstone-lava that had flowed into and\r\nburied it.[249] This water-course, now marked by the picturesque ridge of\r\nthe Scuir of Eigg, was shown to have been excavated by a stream which\r\ncame from the north-east or east, and to be younger, not only than the\r\nplateau-basalts of the district, but than even the dykes which cut\r\nthese basalts. Yet that it belonged to the volcanic period was proved\r\nby the manner in which it had been sealed up and preserved under the\r\nblack glassy lava of the Scuir. Its history and the data from which\r\nthis history is compiled will be narrated in a later part of this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 249: _Scenery of Scotland_ (1865); _Quart. Journ. Geo. Soc._\r\nvol. xxvii. (1871), p. 303.]\r\n\r\nMy examination of the islands of Canna and Sanday, however, brought\r\nto light other and more abundant evidence of river-action in the same\r\nregion of the Inner Hebrides, but belonging to an earlier part of the\r\nvolcanic period. This evidence reveals that a powerful river, flowing\r\nwestwards from the Highland mountains, swept over the volcanic plain,\r\nwhile the sheets of basalt were still being poured forth, and while\r\nvolcanic eruptions were taking place from cones of slag.\r\n\r\nThe basalt-plateau of Canna resembles in all essential particulars\r\nthose of the other Western Isles. Its base is everywhere concealed\r\nunder the sea, but from the fragments of Torridon Sandstone in its\r\nagglomerates we may infer that it probably rests on that formation,\r\nlike the volcanic outliers in Rum. It is formed of successive sheets of\r\ndifferent basalts including the usual banded, amygdaloidal and columnar\r\nforms. Some of them towards the west are specially marked by the great\r\nabundance and large size of their porphyritic felspars. The magnetic\r\nproperties of the basalts at the east end of the island have long been\r\nknown, and have given rise to various modern myths regarding their\r\ninfluence on the compasses of passing vessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 268.--Section of the cliffs below Compass Hill,\r\nIsle of Canna.]\r\n\r\nBut it is in its conglomerates, tuffs and agglomerates and the light\r\nthey cast on some aspects of the volcanic period, elsewhere hardly\r\nrecorded, that the geology of Canna possesses a special importance. To\r\nthese, therefore, we may at once turn.\r\n\r\nThe conglomerates are best developed at the eastern end of the island,\r\nwhere the cliffs present the structure represented in Fig. 268. At the\r\nbase, and passing under the level of the sea, lies the agglomerate\r\n(_a_) of a vent which will be described in Chapter xli., together with\r\nother eruptive orifices of the various plateaux (p. 288). This rock\r\nhas a somewhat uneven upper surface which rises in places about 150\r\nfeet above high tide-mark. Here and there it shades off upward into\r\nthe conglomerate that overlies it; water-worn pebbles appear among its\r\ncontents, and rude traces of bedding begin to show themselves, until,\r\nwithin the course of a few feet, we pass upward into an undoubted\r\nconglomerate. Elsewhere, however, and particularly along the precipices\r\nwest of Compass Hill, the two deposits are more distinctly marked\r\noff from each other. The agglomerate has there a hummocky, irregular\r\nupper surface, as if it had been thrown down in heaps. The hollows\r\nbetween these protuberances have been filled up with conglomerate and\r\nsandstone, forming the base of the thick overlying deposit.\r\n\r\nIt is thus clear that the loose materials of the vent were directly\r\nexposed at the surface when the conglomerate was accumulated, and,\r\nindeed, that these materials served to supply some of the detritus of\r\nwhich the conglomerate consists. The absence of any trace of a cone and\r\ncrater at the vent may perhaps be explicable on the supposition that\r\ntheir incoherent material was washed down by the currents that swept\r\nalong and deposited the conglomerate.\r\n\r\nThe mass of sedimentary material (_b_) which overlies the agglomerate\r\nof the vent forms a conspicuous feature along the lower half of the\r\nprecipices at the eastern end of Canna. It rises to a height of 250\r\nto 300 feet above sea-level, and must reach a maximum thickness of\r\nprobably not less than 100 to 150 feet. It gradually descends in a\r\nwestward direction, both along the northern cliffs and in the lower\r\nground round Canna Harbour, insomuch that in about a mile, owing to the\r\ngentle westerly dip of the whole volcanic series, combined with the\r\neffect of a number of small faults, it passes under the level of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nGreat variation in the character of the detritus composing this thick\r\ngroup of strata may be observed as it is followed westward. On the\r\ncliffs below Compass Hill, as represented in Fig. 268, the coarse\r\nconglomerate with water-worn stones, hardly to be distinguished from\r\nthe volcanic agglomerate of the vent, shows more or less distinct\r\nbedding, or at least a succession of coarser and finer bands. Towards\r\nits base it encloses numerous pieces of Torridon Sandstone, sometimes\r\nsubangular, but often so well and smoothly rounded as to show that they\r\nmust have been long subjected to the action of moving water. It is\r\nfurther observable that, while in the agglomerate the volcanic stones\r\nhave rough surfaces, those in the conglomerate begin to show increasing\r\nevidence of attrition, until, as the deposit is traced upwards, they\r\nbecome almost as well rounded and water-worn as the non-volcanic stones.\r\n\r\nYet amidst and overlying these proofs of transport from some little\r\ndistance lie abundant huge slags and blocks of amygdaloidal lava,\r\nsometimes closely aggregated, sometimes scattered through a volcanic\r\ntuff or ashy sandstone. The composition and structure of these stones,\r\nand the manner of their dispersion through the deposit, leave little\r\ndoubt that they were ejected from the vent. We are thus confronted\r\nwith the interesting fact that, while the materials of the volcanic\r\ncone were being washed down by running water, eruptions were still\r\ntaking place. But by degrees these indications of contemporaneous\r\nvolcanic activity diminish. The detrital materials become coarser and\r\nmore distinctly water-rolled until they pass into greenish sandstones\r\nand fine conglomerates. Yet the matrix even of these higher sediments\r\nis largely composed of fine volcanic detritus, and probably points to\r\noccasional discharges of dust and ashes.\r\n\r\nVarious sills or intrusive sheets have been injected into this\r\nsedimentary group along the precipices at the east end of Canna, and\r\nform there lenticular bands. One of these (_c_) is shown in Fig. 268.\r\n\r\nImmediately above the massive greenish pebbly sandstone (_d_) which\r\ncaps the stratified series lies a group of basalts (_e_), composed of\r\nseveral distinct beds, having a united thickness of from 80 to 100\r\nfeet. The lowest of these has a regular columnar structure, while those\r\noverlying it exhibit the confused starch-like grouping of curved and\r\nrather indistinctly-formed prisms.\r\n\r\nThe next band in upward succession is one of conglomerate (_f_), which\r\nruns as a continuous and conspicuous feature along the upper part of\r\nthe cliff. This rock presents in many respects a strong contrast to the\r\nconglomerates underneath. It is dull-green to yellow in colour, and\r\nis well stratified, being marked by the interstratification of finer\r\nlayers, and passing down into a band of pebbly sandstone, which rests\r\nimmediately on the basalt (_e_). Its component stones are thoroughly\r\nwater-worn, ranging up to six inches or even more in length. But its\r\nmost distinctive character lies in the nature of its pebbles. Instead\r\nof consisting mainly of volcanic materials, these stones have almost\r\nall been transported for some distance. They include abundant fragments\r\nof Torridon Sandstone, gneiss, schists, grits, and other rocks like\r\nthose in Rum and Western Inverness-shire. No such rocks exist _in situ_\r\nin Canna. The nearest tract of Torridon Sandstone is in Rum, about four\r\nmiles to the eastward. But the pieces of schist and epidotic grit like\r\nthe rocks of the Western Highlands, have probably travelled at least 30\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nIt is important to observe that all these transported stones indicate\r\na derivation from some source lying to the eastward of Canna. The\r\nevidence in this respect agrees with that furnished by the ancient\r\nriver-gravel under the pitchstone of the Scuir of Eigg. It is clear\r\nthat the waters which found their way across the lava-fields of this\r\npart of the Inner Hebrides took their rise somewhere to the eastward,\r\nprobably among the mountains of Inverness-shire.\r\n\r\nThe conglomerate now described is from 40 to 50 feet thick. It can be\r\nfollowed along the face of the cliffs for more than a mile on the north\r\nside of Canna. Less persistent on the south side, its outcrop strikes\r\nfrom the edge of the precipice inland, keeping to the south of the top\r\nof Compass Hill. It is well seen in the ravine above the Coroghon, but\r\ncannot be followed further westward among the basalt-terraces. Yet,\r\nthough this stratified intercalation is not traceable far as a band of\r\nconglomerate, the same stratigraphical horizon is probably indicated\r\nelsewhere by other kinds of sedimentary deposits, to which further\r\nreference will be made in the sequel.\r\n\r\nThe section now described establishes the existence of at least two\r\nsuccessive platforms of conglomerate in the volcanic series. Following\r\nthese platforms along their outcrop, we obtain additional light on\r\ntheir origin, and on the topographical conditions under which they\r\nwere deposited, and we learn further that other prolonged intervals,\r\nwhich were likewise marked by intercalations of sedimentary material,\r\noccurred in the outpouring of the basalts.\r\n\r\nTaking first the lower conglomerate of Compass Hill and tracing it\r\nwestward, we find it to form the depression in which the sheltered\r\ninlet of Canna Harbour lies. It is exposed along the shores and also\r\nin the islands enclosed within the same bay. But it is not traceable\r\nfurther west, possibly because it seems to sink beneath the level of\r\nthe sea. To the south-east, though it is there likewise for the most\r\npart concealed under the waves, it rises above them in one or two parts\r\nof the coast-line of Sanday, particularly at the Uamh Ruadh or Red\r\nCave, and likewise on a surf-beaten skerry off Ceann an Eilein, the\r\nhighest part of the Sanday cliffs--a distance of about a mile and a\r\nhalf from Compass Hill. Throughout this space it retains its remarkably\r\ncoarse character and is mainly made up of volcanic material.\r\n\r\nThe numerous sections exposed in Canna Harbour enable us to study the\r\ncomposition and local variations of this curious deposit. On the north\r\nside of the basin, while the lower part of the sedimentary series\r\ncontinues to be an exceedingly coarse volcanic conglomerate, it passes\r\nupward into finer conglomerates, tuffs, and shales. In front of Canna\r\nHouse the imbedded blocks are of large size, occasionally as much as\r\nthree or four feet in diameter. They are still more gigantic on the\r\nisland of Eilean a' Bhaird, where I found one to contain 150 cubic feet\r\nin the exposed part, the rest being still concealed in the matrix. As\r\nthey are generally somewhat rounded, here and there markedly so, most\r\nof these stones have probably undergone a certain amount of attrition\r\nin water. The great majority of them, and certainly all those of\r\nlarger size, are pieces of basalt, dolerite, andesite, etc. Among them\r\nhuge blocks of amygdaloid and coarsely vesicular lava are specially\r\nabundant. Some of these look like pieces of slag torn from the upper\r\nsurface of lava-streams. Others, displaying a highly vesicular centre\r\nand a close-grained outer crust, are suggestive of bombs. It is\r\ninteresting to note here again that the amygdaloidal blocks present\r\ntheir zeolitic infiltrations so precisely like those of the amygdaloids\r\nof the plateau that it seems reasonable to suppose the carbonate of\r\nlime, zeolites, etc. to have been introduced before the blocks were\r\nimbedded in the conglomerate.\r\n\r\nThe whole aspect of this deposit is eminently volcanic. It looks like\r\na vast sheet of lava-fragments swept away from one or more cones of\r\nslags and cinders, or from the scoriaceous surface of a lava-stream.\r\nWhere the vesicles were still empty, the large boulders could be more\r\neasily swept along by moving water. But a powerful current must have\r\nbeen needed to transport and wear down into more or less rounded forms\r\nblocks of basic lava, many of which must weigh several tons. The large\r\nblock on Eilean a' Bhaird probably exceeds 12 tons in weight.\r\n\r\nBesides the obviously volcanic contents of the conglomerate there occur\r\nhere also, as in the Compass Hill cliffs, abundant pieces of Torridon\r\nSandstone. These stones are notably smaller in size and more perfectly\r\nwater-worn and even polished than the blocks of lava. Obviously they\r\nhave travelled further and have undergone more prolonged attrition.\r\n\r\nThe matrix of the rock consists essentially of the fine detritus of\r\nbasic lavas, probably mingled with true volcanic dust. The coarser\r\nparts display only the feeblest indication of stratification; indeed,\r\nin a limited exposure the rock might be regarded as a tumultuous\r\nagglomerate. But the manner in which the deposit is intercalated\r\nwith, and sometimes overlies, green tuffs and shales, together with\r\nthe water-worn condition of its stones, shows that it has not been\r\naccumulated in a volcanic chimney, but has been thrown down by some\r\npowerful body of water, with probably the co-operation of volcanic\r\ndischarges.\r\n\r\nWhile the composition of the conglomerate suffices to indicate that\r\nthis deposit was formed at a time when some volcano was active in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood, singularly convincing proofs of the work of\r\nthis vent are to be seen in the form of intercalated sheets of lava.\r\nThus on Eilean a' Bhaird the boulders of the conglomerate are overlain\r\nand wrapped round by a sheet of rudely prismatic basalt, with lines of\r\nvesicles arranged in the direction of the bedding. A similar relation\r\ncan be traced along the beach between Canna House and the wooden pier,\r\nwhere successive sheets of basalt have flowed over the conglomerate\r\n(Fig. 269).\r\n\r\nBut, besides coarse volcanic detritus, the sedimentary platform\r\nrepresented by the lower conglomerate of Compass Hill includes other\r\ndeposits of which good sections may be examined all round Canna\r\nHarbour. Beds of fine well-stratified dull-green tuff pass by an\r\nadmixture of pebbles into fine ashy conglomerate or pebbly sandstone,\r\nand by an increase in the proportion of their fine detritus into\r\nvolcanic mudstone and fine shales. The shales vary from a pale grey\r\nor white tone into blackish grey, brown, and black. They are well\r\nstratified and are frequently interleaved with layers of fine tuff.\r\nThe darker bands are carbonaceous, and are not infrequently full\r\nof ill-preserved vegetation. Indeed, leaves and stems in a rather\r\nmacerated condition are of common occurrence in all the shaly layers.\r\nHere and there, especially in some ashy shales in front of Canna House,\r\nI observed a recognisable _Sequoia_. The mudstones are dull green,\r\nclose-grained shattery rocks composed of fine volcanic detritus,\r\nand pass both laterally and vertically into shales, tuffs, and\r\nconglomerates. They suggest showers of fine dust or streams of volcanic\r\nmud. They, too, contain fragmentary plants.\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy fact that the sedimentary intercalations among the\r\nCanna basalts generally end upward in carbonaceous shales or coaly\r\nlayers. The strong currents and overflows of water, which rolled\r\nand spread out the coarse materials of the conglomerates, gave way\r\nto quieter conditions that allowed silt and mud to gather over the\r\nwater-bottom, while leaves and other fragments of vegetation, blown\r\nor washed into these quiet reaches, were the last of the suspended\r\nmaterials to sink to the bottom. Good illustrations of this sequence\r\nin the case of the lower conglomerate zone of Canna may be studied\r\nalong the shores of Sanday, from the Catholic Chapel eastwards. The\r\nfine pebbly sandstones, tuffs, and shales, which there overlie the\r\ncoarse conglomerate, are surmounted by dark brown or black carbonaceous\r\nshale, with lenticles of matted vegetation that pass into impure coal.\r\nImmediately overlying this coaly layer comes a sheet of prismatic\r\nvesicular basalt, followed by another with an exceedingly slaggy\r\ntexture.\r\n\r\nLenticles of shale and mudstone likewise occur in the heart of the\r\nfiner parts of the conglomerate, especially towards the top, as may be\r\nseen in the section exposed beneath the basalt behind the first cottage\r\nwest from Canna House. One of the most interesting layers in this\r\nsection is a seam of tuff, varying up to about two inches in thickness,\r\nwhich lies at the top of the lenticular band of tuffs and shales, and\r\nimmediately beneath the band of basalt-conglomerate, on which a basalt,\r\ncarrying a vesicular band near its bottom, rests. Traced laterally, the\r\ndark brown tuff of this seam gradually passes into a series of rounded\r\nbodies and flattened shells composed of a colourless mineral which has\r\nevidently been developed _in situ_ after the deposition of the tuff.\r\nMr. Harker's notes on thin slices made from this band are as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"This is a rusty-brown, dull-looking rock, rather soft and seemingly\r\nlight, but too absorbent to permit of its specific gravity being\r\ntested. The dark brown mass is in great part studded with little\r\nspheroidal bodies, 1/50 to 1/10 inch in diameter, of paler colour,\r\nbut the larger ones having a dark nucleus. In other parts larger flat\r\nbodies have been formed, as if by the coalescence of the spheroids,\r\nextending as inconstant bands in the direction of lamination for\r\nperhaps 1/2 inch, with a thickness of 1/10 inch or less. The appearance\r\nis that of a spherulitic rather than an oolitic structure.\r\n\r\n\"A slice [6658 A] shows the general mass of the rock to be of an\r\nextremely finely divided but coherent substance of brown colour, which\r\ncan scarcely be other than a fine volcanic dust, composed of minute\r\nparticles of basic glass or 'palagonite' compacted together. Scattered\r\nthrough this are fragments of crystals recognizable as triclinic and\r\nperhaps monoclinic felspars, green hornblende, augite, olivine (?), and\r\nmagnetite, usually quite fresh.\r\n\r\n\"The curious spheroidal and elongated growths already mentioned are\r\nbetter seen in another slide [6658 B], where they occupy the larger\r\npart of the field, leaving only an interstitial framework of the brown\r\nmatrix. The substance of the little spheroids is clear, colourless,\r\nand apparently structureless. The centre is often occupied by an\r\nirregularly stellate patch of brown colour, and sometimes cracks tend\r\nto run in radiating fashion, but these are the only indications of\r\nradial structure. The outer boundary is sharply defined, and where the\r\nslice is shattered the spheroids have separated from the matrix. The\r\nmatrix is darker than in the normal rock, being obscured by iron-oxide\r\nwhich we may conceive as having been expelled from the spaces occupied\r\nby the spheroids. The little crystal-fragments are enclosed in the\r\nspheroids as well as in the matrix, but there is no appearance of\r\ntheir having served as starting-points for radiate growths. The flat\r\nelongated bodies are like the spheroids, with merely the modifications\r\nimplied in their different shape.\r\n\r\n\"The identity of the clear colourless substance seems to be rather\r\ndoubtful. It is sensibly isotropic and of refractive power distinctly\r\nlower than that of felspar. These characters would agree with analcime,\r\nwhich is not unknown as a contact-mineral; but it is difficult to\r\nunderstand how analcime, even a lime-bearing variety like that of Plas\r\nNewydd,[250] could be formed in abundance from palagonitic material.\r\nAn alternative supposition, perhaps more probable, is that the clear\r\nsubstance is a glass, modified from its former nature, especially by\r\nthe expulsion of the iron-oxide into the remaining matrix. A comparison\r\nis at once suggested with certain types of 'Knotenschiefer,' but\r\nrespecting the thermal metamorphism of fine volcanic tuffs there seems\r\nto be little or no direct information.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 250: Henslow, _Trans. Camb. Phil. Soc._ (1821), vol. i. p.\r\n408; Mr. Harker, _Geol. Mag._ (1887), p. 414. Mr. W. W. Watts suggests\r\na comparison with the hexagonal bodies figured by Mr. Monckton in an\r\naltered limestone from Stirlingshire: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol.\r\nli. p. 487.]\r\n\r\nLenticular interstratifications of shale and mudstone make their\r\nappearance even in the coarser parts of the conglomerate, as may be\r\nobserved on the beach below Canna House where, as shown in Fig. 269,\r\nsome shales and tuffs (_a_) full of ill-defined leaves are surmounted\r\nby a conglomerate (_b_). The deposition of this overlying bed of\r\nboulders has given rise to some scooping-out of the finer strata\r\nunderneath. Subsequently both the conglomerate and shales have been\r\noverspread by a stream of dolerite (_c_), the slaggy bottom of which\r\nhas ploughed its way through them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 269.--Lava cutting out conglomerate and shale.\r\nShore below Canna House.]\r\n\r\nBefore discussing the probable conditions under which the group of\r\nsedimentary deposits now described was formed, we may conveniently\r\nfollow the upper conglomerate band of the Compass Hill, and note the\r\nvariations in structure and composition which its outcrop presents.\r\n\r\nThis yellowish conglomerate can be traced along the cliffs for more\r\nthan a mile, when it descends below the sea-level at the solitary stack\r\nof Bod an Stòl. A few hundred yards further west, what is probably\r\nthe same band appears again at the base of the precipice overlain\r\nby prismatic basalts. But the conglomerate, here only 12 feet thick,\r\nis made of much finer detritus which, largely composed of volcanic\r\nmaterial, includes small well-rounded and polished pebbles of Torridon\r\nSandstone. Beneath it lies a bed of dark shale, with remains of plants,\r\nresting immediately on a zeolitic amygdaloid which plunges into the\r\nsea. The chief interest of this locality is to be found in the shale\r\nwhich, instead of being at the top of the sedimentary group, lies at\r\nthe bottom. I was informed by Mr. A. Thom that leaves had been obtained\r\nfrom this shale; but I was not successful in my search for them. The\r\nlocality is only accessible by boat, and, as the coast is fully exposed\r\nto the Atlantic swell, landing at the place is usually difficult and\r\noften impossible.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile and a half still further west, where a foreshore fronts\r\nthe precipice of Earnagream at the Camas Tharbernish, a band of\r\nintercalated sedimentary material underlies the great escarpment of\r\nbasalts and rests upon the slaggy sheet with the singular surface\r\nalready referred to (p. 187). This band not improbably occupies the\r\nsame platform as the upper conglomerate of Compass Hill. It is only\r\nabout seven feet thick, the lower four feet consisting of a dull green\r\npebbly tuff or ashy sandstone, with small rounded pieces of Torridon\r\nSandstone, while the upper three feet are formed of dark shale with\r\ncrowded but indistinct remains of plants. Here the more usual order\r\nin the sequence of deposition is restored. The shale is indurated\r\nand shattery, so that no slabs can be extracted without the use of\r\nquarrying tools.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 270.--Section of shales and tuffs, with a coniferous stump\r\n  lying between two basalt-sheets, Cùl nam Marbh, Canna.\r\n]\r\n\r\nRather less than half a mile towards the south, on the roadside\r\nat the gully of Cùl nam Marbh, the basalts enclose a sedimentary\r\ninterstratification which not improbably lies on the same horizon as\r\nthose just described along the northern shore. The relations of the\r\nrocks at this locality are shown in Fig. 270. A remarkable slaggy\r\nbasalt (_a_) rises into a hummock, against which have been deposited\r\nsome fine granular tuffs (_b_) whereof only a few inches are visible,\r\nthat pass up into a thin band of dark shale (_c_), including a layer\r\nof pebbly ferruginous tuff, with small rounded pea-like pieces of\r\nbasalt, basic pumice, bole, limonite, etc. At the top of this shale an\r\nirregular parting of coaly material (_d_) lies immediately under the\r\nslaggy base of the succeeding basalt (_e_). It will be observed that\r\nthis upper lava cuts out the shale and thus comes to rest directly\r\nupon the lower sheet. At the point where it begins to descend it has\r\ncaught up and enclosed a small tree-stump (_d´_) which stands upright\r\non the coaly parting and shale. This stump, at the time of my visit,\r\nmeasured five inches in height by three inches in breadth; it had\r\nbeen thoroughly charred and was crumbling away on exposure, but among\r\nthe pieces which I took from it sufficient trace of structure can be\r\ndetected with the microscope to show the tree to have been a conifer.\r\n\r\nWe have here another instance of the deposition of volcanic dust and\r\nfine mud in a pool that filled a hollow in the lava-field. Again we see\r\nthat the closing act of sedimentation was the subsidence of vegetable\r\nmatter in the pool, which was finally buried under another outflow of\r\nbasalt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 271.--Dùn Mòr, Sanday. (From a photograph by Miss\r\nThom.)]\r\n\r\nIt is on the southern coast of the isle of Sanday that the higher\r\nintercalations of sedimentary material among the basalts are most\r\ninstructively displayed. At the eastern end of this island, as already\r\nstated, the lowest and coarsest conglomerate is visible on a skerry\r\nimmediately to the south of the headland Ceann an Eilein. It doubtless\r\nunderlies the Sanday cliffs, but is not there visible, for the\r\nbasalts descend below sea-level. These volcanic sheets have a slight\r\ninclination westward; hence in that direction we gradually pass into\r\nhigher parts of the series. In the Creag nam Faoileann (Seamews' Crag)\r\nand the gully that cuts its eastern end, likewise in the two singularly\r\npicturesque stacks of Dùn Mòr and Dùn Beag (Big and Little Gull Rocks),\r\nwhich here rise from the foreshore, two distinct platforms of detrital\r\nmaterial may be noticed among the basalts. Both of these can be well\r\nseen on Dùn Mòr, about 100 feet high, which is represented in Fig.\r\n271. The lower band, four or live feet thick, is here a rather coarse\r\nconglomerate which lies upon a sheet of scoriaceous basalt that extends\r\nup to the base of the Creag nam Faoileann. It is directly overlain by\r\nanother basalt, about 30 feet thick, which dips seawards and forms a\r\nbroad shelving platform, whereon the tides rise and fall. On this stack\r\na second coarse conglomerate, about 10 feet thick, forms a conspicuous\r\nband about a third of the height from the bottom; it is composed mainly\r\nof well-rounded blocks of various lavas up to 18 inches or more in\r\ndiameter, but it contains also pieces of Torridon Sandstone. It is\r\ncovered by about 60 feet of basalt, which towards the base is somewhat\r\nregularly columnar, but passes upward into the wavy, starch-like,\r\nprismatic structure.\r\n\r\nIf now we trace these two intercalated zones of conglomerate along\r\nthe shore, we find them both rapidly to change their characters and\r\nto disappear. The lower, though formed of coarse detritus under the\r\nDùn Mòr, passes on the opposite cliff in a space of not more than 60\r\nyards, into fine tuff and shale, about six feet thick, which become\r\ncarbonaceous at the top where they are overlain by the next basalt.\r\nA hundred yards to the east, the band likewise consists of tuffs and\r\nashy shales, which underlie the basalts on the Dùn Beag, and again\r\nshow the usual coaly layers at the top. On the east side of the gully\r\nin the coast, about 160 yards to the north-east of Dùn Mòr, the same\r\nband is reduced to not more than three feet in thickness, consisting\r\nchiefly of fine conglomerate, wherein well water-worn pebbles of\r\nTorridon Sandstone and epidotic grit appear among the predominant\r\nvolcanic detritus. This conglomerate is surmounted by a few inches of\r\ndark carbonaceous mudstone or shale. Rough slaggy basalts lie above and\r\nbelow the band.\r\n\r\nThe upper conglomerate dies out, both towards the east and the west,\r\nin the cliff opposite to Dùn Mòr, dwindling down at last to merely a\r\nfew pebbles between the basalts. It lies in a kind of channel or hollow\r\namong these lavas. This depression, in an east and west direction,\r\ncannot be more than about 65 yards broad.\r\n\r\nProbably still higher in the series of basalts is another intercalation\r\nof sedimentary layers which may be seen in the little bay to the east\r\nof Tallabric, rather more than a mile to the west of the Creag nam\r\nFaoileann. It rests upon a coarsely slaggy amygdaloid, and is from six\r\nto ten feet in thickness. The lower and larger part of the deposit\r\nconsists of greenish pebbly sandstone and fine conglomerate, largely\r\ncomposed of basaltic detritus, but including abundant well-smoothed and\r\npolished pebbles of Torridon Sandstone, green grit, quartzite, etc. The\r\nstones vary from mere pea-like pebbles up to pieces two or three inches\r\nlong, the largest being generally fragments of slag and amygdaloid\r\nwhich are less water-worn than the sandstones and other foreign\r\ningredients. The uppermost two or three feet of the intercalation\r\nconsist of dark carbonaceous mudstone or shale, made up in large\r\nmeasure of volcanic detritus, which may have been derived partly from\r\neruptions of fine dust, partly from subærial disintegration of the\r\nbasalt-sheets. Some layers of these finer strata are full of remains of\r\nmuch macerated plants.\r\n\r\nOther thin coaly intercalations have been observed among the basalts\r\nof Canna, some of which may possibly mark still higher horizons than\r\nthose now described. But, confining our attention to the regular\r\nsequence of intercalations exposed along the Sanday coast, we find\r\nat least four distinct platforms of interstratified sediment among\r\nthe plateau-basalts of this district. Each of these marks a longer or\r\nshorter interval in the outflow of lava, and points to the action of\r\nmoving-water over the surface of the lava-fields.\r\n\r\nWe may now consider the probable conditions under which this\r\nintervention of aqueous action took place. The idea that the sea had\r\nanything to do with these conglomerates, sandstones, and shales may\r\nbe summarily dismissed from consideration. The evidence that the\r\nbasalt-eruptions took place on a terrestrial surface is entirely\r\nconvincing, and geologists are now agreed upon this question.\r\n\r\nExcluding marine action, we have to choose among forms of fresh\r\nwater--between lakes on the one hand and rivers on the other. That the\r\nagency concerned in the transport and deposition of these strata was\r\nthat of a river may be confidently concluded on the following grounds:--\r\n\r\n1. The large size and rolled shape of the boulders in the\r\nconglomerates. To move blocks several tons in weight, and not only to\r\nmove them but to wear them into more or less rounded forms, must have\r\nrequired the operation of strong currents of water. The coarse detritus\r\nintercalated among the basalts is quite comparable to the shingle of a\r\nmodern river, which descends with rapidity and in ample volume from a\r\nrange of hills.\r\n\r\n2. The evidence that the materials of the conglomerates are not\r\nentirely local, but include a marked proportion of foreign stones.\r\nThe proofs of transport are admirably exhibited by pieces of Torridon\r\nSandstone, epidotic grit, quartzite, and other hard rocks none of which\r\noccur _in situ_ except at some distance from Canna. These stones are\r\noften not merely rounded, but so well smoothed and polished as to show\r\nthat they must have been rolled along for some considerable time in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n3. The lenticular character and rapid lithological variations of the\r\nstrata, both laterally and vertically. The coarse conglomerates die\r\nout as they are followed along their outcrop and pass into finer\r\nsediment. They seem to occur in irregular banks, which may not be more\r\nthan 200 feet broad, like the shingle-banks of a river. The coarser\r\nsediment generally lies in the lower part of the sedimentary group.\r\nBut cases may be observed, such as that shown in Fig. 269, where fine\r\nsediment, laid down upon the bottom conglomerate, has subsequently been\r\noverspread by another inroad of coarse shingle. Such alternations are\r\nnot difficult to understand if they are looked upon as indicating the\r\nsuccessive floods and quieter intervals of a river.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I regard the platforms of sedimentary materials\r\nintercalated among the basalts of Canna and Sanday as the successive\r\nflood-plains of a river which, like the rivers that traverse the\r\nlava-deserts of Iceland, flowed perhaps in many separate channels\r\nacross the basalt-fields of the Inner Hebrides, and was liable to have\r\nits course shifted from time to time by fresh volcanic eruptions.\r\nThat this river came from the east or north-east and had its source\r\namong the Western Highlands of Inverness-shire, may be inferred from\r\nthe nature of the stones which it has carried for 30 miles or more\r\nalong its bed. And that it crossed in its course the tract of Torridon\r\nSandstone, of which a portion still remains in Rum, is manifest from\r\nthe abundance of the fragments of that formation in the conglomerates.\r\n\r\nWith the remarkable exception of the section on Dùn Beag, to be\r\nimmediately referred to, no trace of any eroded channel of this river\r\nthrough the lavas of the great volcanic plain has been preserved.\r\nPossibly frequent invasions of its bed by streams of basalt from\r\ndifferent vents hindered it from remaining long enough in one course\r\nto erode anything like a gorge or canon. But, in any case, the main\r\nchannel of the river probably lay rather to the east of the present\r\nislands of Canna and Sanday, on ground which is now covered by the\r\nsea. The banks or sheets of boulder-conglomerate undoubtedly show\r\nwhere its current swept with great force over the lava-plain, but the\r\nmanner in which these coarser materials are so often covered with fine\r\nsilt suggests that the sedimentary materials now visible were rather\r\ndeposited on the low grounds over which the steam rushed in times of\r\nflood. Pools of water would often be left after such inundations, and\r\nin these depressions silt would gradually accumulate, partly carried\r\nin suspension by the river, partly washed in by rain, while drift-wood\r\nthat found its way into these eddies, and leaves blown into them from\r\nthe trees and shrubs of the surrounding country, would remain for\r\nsome time afloat and would be the last of the detritus to sink to the\r\nbottom. Hence, no doubt, the carbonaceous character of the hardened\r\nsilt in the upper part of each intercalation of sediment.\r\n\r\nIf we were to look upon the volcanic materials in the conglomerates\r\nas derived from the subærial disintegration of the fields of basalt,\r\nwe should be compelled to admit a very large amount of erosion of the\r\nsurface of the volcanic plain during the period when the river flowed\r\nover that tract. It would be necessary to suppose not only that there\r\nwas a considerable rainfall, but that the differences of temperature,\r\neither from day to night, or from summer to winter, were so great as\r\nto split up the lavas at the surface, in order to provide the river\r\nwith the blocks which it has rolled into rounded boulders. I do not\r\nthink, however, that such a deduction would be sound. If we compare\r\nthe materials that have filled up the large eruptive vent at the east\r\nend of Canna (to be afterwards described) with the great majority of\r\nthe blocks in the coarse conglomerates, we cannot fail to note their\r\nstrong resemblance. The abundance of lumps of slaggy lava in the\r\nriver-shingle corresponds with their predominance in the agglomerate\r\nof the vent. The boulders of basalt, dolerite, and andesite which\r\ncrowd the conglomerates need not have been derived from the action\r\nof atmospheric waste on the lava-fields, but might quite well have\r\nbeen mainly supplied by the demolition of volcanic cones of fragmental\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 272.--View of the Dùn Beag, Sanday, seen from the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\n(From a Photograph by Miss Thom.)]\r\n\r\nThat such has really been the chief source of the blocks in the\r\nconglomerates I cannot doubt. At the east end of Canna we actually\r\ndetect a volcanic cone, partly washed down and overlain by a pile\r\nof river-shingle. There were probably many such mounds of slag and\r\nstones along lines of fissure all over the lava-fields. The river in\r\nits winding course might come upon one cone after another, and during\r\ntimes of flood, or when its waters burst through any temporary barrier\r\ncreated by volcanic operations it would attack the slopes of loose\r\nmaterial and sweep their detritus onward. At the same time, the current\r\nwould carry forward its own natural burden of far-transported sediment,\r\nand hence on its flood-plains, buried and preserved under sheets of\r\nbasalt, we find abundant pebbles of the old Highland rocks which it had\r\nborne across the whole breadth of the basaltic lowland.\r\n\r\nBut the destruction of volcanic cones was probably not the only source\r\nof the basaltic detritus in the conglomerates of Canna and Sanday. I\r\nhave shown that these conglomerates pass laterally into tuffs, and\r\nare sometimes underlain, sometimes overlain, with similar material.\r\nIt is quite obvious that their deposition was contemporaneous with\r\nvolcanic action in the immediate neighbourhood, and that at least part\r\nof their finer sediment was obtained directly from volcanic explosions.\r\nIn wandering over the coast-sections of these coarse deposits, I\r\nhave been impressed with the enormous size of many of the stones,\r\ntheir resemblance to the ejected blocks of the agglomerate, and the\r\ndistinction that may sometimes be made with more or less clearness\r\nbetween their rather angular forms and the more rounded and somewhat\r\nwater-worn aspect of the other boulders. It seems to me not improbable\r\nthat some of the remarkably coarse masses of unstratified conglomerate\r\nin Canna Harbour consist largely of ejected blocks from the adjacent\r\nvent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 273.--View of Dùn Beag, Sanday, from the north. The\r\nisland of Rum in the distance.\r\n\r\n(From a Photograph by Miss Thom.)]\r\n\r\nThe only instance which I have observed of erosion of the basalt\r\ncontemporaneous with the operations of the river that spread out this\r\nconglomerate is to be found in the striking stack of Dùn Beag already\r\nalluded to.[251] This extraordinary monument of geological history\r\nforms an outlying obelisk which rises from the platform of the shore\r\nto a height of about 70 feet. Seen from the south-west, it appears\r\nto consist entirely of bedded basalt resting on some stratified tuff\r\nand shale which intervene between these lavas and that of the broad\r\nplatform of basalt on which the obelisk stands. On that side it\r\npresents no essential difference from the structure of the Dùn Mòr to\r\nthe west, save that the lower conglomerate of that outlier is here\r\nrepresented by fine sediment, and the upper conglomerate is wanting.\r\nThe general aspect of this south-western front of the stack is shown in\r\nFig. 272. If, however, we approach the rock from the coast-gully to the\r\nnorth, we form a very different impression of its structure. It then\r\nappears to consist chiefly of conglomerate with a capping of basalt on\r\nthe top (Fig. 273). Not until a close scrutiny is made of the eastern\r\nand western faces of the column do the true structure and history of\r\nthis singular piece of topography become apparent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 251: This pinnacle of rock is referred to by Macculloch in\r\nhis account of Canna, and is figured in Plate xix. Fig. 3 of his work\r\nalready cited. But neither his description nor his drawing conveys any\r\nidea of the real structure of the rock.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 274.--Section of eastern front of Dùn Beag.\r\n\r\n_a_, Very shaggy amygdaloidal basalt; _b_, shales and tuff; _c_, slaggy\r\nand jointed basalts; _d_, conglomerate; _e_, prismatic basalt.\r\n\r\nThe dotted lines indicate the supposed form of the ravine.]\r\n\r\nOn the eastern front, the section represented in Fig. 274 is exposed.\r\nAt the bottom, forming the pediment of the column, lies a sheet of\r\nslaggy and vesicular or amygdaloidal basalt (_a_), which shelves gently\r\nin a south-westerly direction into the sea. The lowest band (_b_)\r\nin the structure of the stack is a thin group of lilac, brown, and\r\ngreen shale and volcanic mudstone or tuff, which encloses pieces of\r\nconiferous wood, and becomes markedly carbonaceous in its uppermost\r\nlayers. Above these strata on the south front comes the pile of bedded\r\nbasalts (_c_) with their slaggy lower and upper surfaces. But as we\r\nfollow them round the east side, we find them to be abruptly cut off by\r\na mass of conglomerate (_d_). That the vertical junction-line is not a\r\nfault is speedily ascertained. The lower platform of slaggy basalt runs\r\non unbroken under both shales and conglomerate. Moreover, the line of\r\nmeeting of this conglomerate with the basalts that overlie the shales\r\nis not a clean-cut straight wall, but displays projections and recesses\r\nof the igneous rocks, round and into which the materials of the\r\nconglomerate have been deposited. The pebbles may be seen filling up\r\nlittle crevices, passing under overhanging ledges of the basalts, and\r\nsharply truncating lines of scoriaceous structure in these rocks. The\r\nsame relations may be observed on the west front of the stack. There\r\nthe ashy shales and tuffs are sharply cut out by the conglomerate,\r\nwhich wraps round and underlies a projecting cornice of the slaggy\r\nbottom of the basalt that rests on the stratified band (Fig. 275).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 275.--Enlarged Section on the western side of Dùn Beag.\r\n\r\n  _a_, amygdaloid; _b_, tuff; _c_, ashy shales; _d_, layer of coaly\r\n  shale; _e_, amygdaloidal basalts conglomerate.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe conglomerate is rudely stratified horizontally, its bedding being\r\nbest shown by occasional partings of greenish sandstone. It consists\r\nof well-rounded, polished, and water-worn stones, chiefly of members\r\nof the volcanic series--basalts, and dolerites, both compact and\r\namygdaloidal or slaggy--but with a conspicuous admixture of Torridon\r\nSandstone, gneiss, grey granite, grit and different schists. The\r\ncoarsest part of the deposit lies toward the bottom where the volcanic\r\nblocks, some of them being six and eight feet in diameter, may have\r\noriginally fallen from the basalts against which the conglomerate now\r\nreposes. The far-transported stones are also of considerable size,\r\npieces of granite and gneiss frequently exceeding a foot in length. The\r\nwell-rounded pebbles of foreign materials have been washed into the\r\ninterstices between the large volcanic blocks.\r\n\r\nIt is, I think, tolerably clear that the wall of basalt against which\r\nthis conglomerate has been laid down is one of erosion. The beds of\r\nbasalt have here been trenched by some agent which has likewise scooped\r\nout the soft underlying shales, and even cut them away from under their\r\nprotecting cover of basalt. There can be little hesitation in regarding\r\nthis agent as a water-course, which for some considerable interval of\r\ntime continued to dig its channel through the hard basalts. There is\r\nnot room enough between the basalt-wall of Dùn Beag and the opposite\r\ncliffs of the shore (where no trace of this conglomerate is to be seen)\r\nfor any large stream to have found its way. I do not therefore seek to\r\nidentify this relic of an ancient waterway with the channel of the main\r\nriver which deposited the conglomerate bands of Canna and Sanday. More\r\nprobably it was either a mere torrential chasm, or a tributary stream\r\ndraining a certain part of the volcanic plateau and allowed to retain\r\nits channel long enough to be able to erode it to a depth of nearly\r\n50 feet. Erosion had reached down through the underlying tuffs to the\r\nslaggy basalt below, but before it had made any progress in that sheet\r\nits operations were brought to an end at this locality by the floods\r\nthat swept in the coarse shingle, and by the subsequent stream of\r\nbasalt of which a mere outlying fragment now forms the upper third of\r\nthe stack (_e_, Fig. 274).\r\n\r\nThat the ravine or gully of Dùn Beag probably lay within the reach\r\nof the floods of the main river, may be inferred from the number and\r\nsize of the far-transported rocks in its conglomerate. It was filled\r\nup gradually, but the conditions of deposition remained little changed\r\nduring the process, except that the largest blocks of rock were swept\r\ninto the chasm in the earlier part of its history, while much smaller\r\nand more water-worn shingle were introduced towards the close.\r\n\r\nDenudation, which has performed such marvels in the topography of the\r\nWest of Scotland since older Tertiary time, has here obliterated every\r\ntrace of this ancient gully, save the little fragment of one of the\r\nwalls which survives in the stack of Dùn Beag. When in the course of\r\ncenturies this picturesque obelisk shall have yielded to the action\r\nof the elements, the last leaflet of one of the most interesting\r\nchapters in the geological history of the Inner Hebrides will have been\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises--What was the subsequent history of the\r\nriver which has left so many records of its floods entombed among the\r\nbasalts of Canna and Sanday? In particular, can any connection be\r\ntraced or plausibly conjectured between it and the river-bed preserved\r\nunder the Scuir of Eigg? To this question I shall return after the\r\nevidence for the existence and date of the latter stream has been laid\r\nbefore the reader.\r\n\r\nIn the chain of the Inner Hebrides, broken as it is in outline and\r\nvaried in its types of scenery, there is no object more striking than\r\nthe island of Eigg. Though only about five miles long and from a mile\r\nand a half to three miles and a half broad, and nowhere reaching\r\na height of so much as 1300 feet, this little island, from the\r\nsingularity of one feature of its surface, forms a conspicuous and\r\nfamiliar landmark. Viewed in the simplest way, Eigg may be regarded as\r\nconsisting of an isolated part of the basaltic plateau which, instead\r\nof forming a rolling tableland or a chain of hills with terraced sides,\r\nas in Antrim, Mull and Skye, has been so tilted that, while it caps\r\na lofty cliff about 1000 feet above the waves at the north end, it\r\nslopes gently along the length of the island to the south end. In its\r\nsouthern half, however, the ground rises, owing to the preservation of\r\nan upper mass of lavas, which denudation has removed from the northern\r\nhalf. On this thicker part of the plateau stands the distinguishing\r\nfeature of the island, the strange fantastic ridge of the Scuir, which,\r\nseen from the north or south, looks like a long steep hill-crest,\r\nending in a sharp precipice on the east. Viewed from the east, this\r\nprecipice is seen to be the end of a huge mountain-wall, which rises\r\nvertically above the basalt-plateau to a height of more than 350 feet.\r\nThe accompanying map (Fig. 276) shows that the ridge of the Scuir\r\ncorresponds with the area occupied by a mass of pitchstone, and that\r\nwhile the basaltic rocks cover the whole of the rest of the southern\r\nhalf of the island, they gradually rise towards the north, successive\r\nmembers of the Jurassic series making their appearance until, at the\r\ncliffs of Dunan Thalasgair, the latter cover the greater part of the\r\nsurface, and leave the volcanic rocks as a mere stripe capping the\r\ncliffs. In the section (Fig. 277) the general structure of the island\r\nis represented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 276.--Geological Map of the Island of Eigg.\r\n\r\n  P, Pitchstone-lava of the Scuir; R, old river gravel under\r\n  pitchstone; _p p_, small veins of Pitchstone; _b b_, dykes, veins\r\n  and sheets of intrusive basalt; the short black lines running\r\n  north-west and south-east are basalt dykes; _f f_, granophyre\r\n  sills; D, bedded basalts with occasional tuffs; F, andesite; 1, 2,\r\n  3, 4, clays, shales, sandstones, limestones, etc. (Jurassic); xx,\r\n  Loch Beinn Tighe; x, Loch a Bhealaich. --> General dip of the rocks.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 277.--Section of the geological structure of the\r\nIsland of Eigg.\r\n\r\nP, Pitchstone-lava of Scuir; _c_, ancient river-gravel; _p p_,\r\npitchstone veins; _f f_, intrusive granophyre, etc.; _b b_, dolerite\r\nand basalt dykes and veins; B, intrusive dolerite and basalt-sheets; D,\r\nbedded dolerites and basalts; F, andesite bed; 1-4, Jurassic rocks.]\r\n\r\nIn Eigg the fragment of the basalt-plateau which has been preserved,\r\nrests unconformably on successive platforms of the Jurassic formations.\r\nIts component sheets of lava rise in cliffs around the greater part\r\nof the island. As they dip gently southwards their lower members are\r\nseen along the northern and eastern shores, while on the south-west\r\nside their higher portions are exposed in the lofty precipices which\r\nthere plunge vertically into the sea. The total thickness of the\r\nvolcanic series may here be about 1100 feet. The rocks consist of the\r\nusual types--black, fine-grained, columnar and amorphous basalts,\r\nmore coarsely crystalline dolerites, dull earthy amygdaloids with red\r\npartings, and occasional thin bands of basalt-conglomerate or tuff.\r\nThe individual beds range in thickness from 20 to 50 or 60 feet.\r\nThough they seem quite continuous when looked at from the sea, yet, on\r\ncloser examination, they are found not unfrequently to die out, the\r\nplace of one bed being taken by another, or even by more than one,\r\nin continuation of the same horizon. The only marked petrographical\r\nvariety which occurs among them is a light-coloured band which stands\r\nout conspicuously among the darker ordinary sheets of the escarpment on\r\nthe east side of the island. The microscopic characters of this rock\r\nshow it to belong to the same series of highly felspathic, andesitic,\r\nor trachitic lavas as the \"pale group\" of Ben More, in Mull. It is\r\nstrongly vesicular, and the cells are in some parts so flattened and\r\nelongated as to impart a kind of fissile texture to the rock. There\r\ncan be no doubt that this band is a true lava, and that it was poured\r\nout during the accumulation of the basalt-plateau. It supplies an\r\ninteresting example of the intercalation of a lighter and less basic\r\nlava among the ordinary heavy basic basalts and dolerites.\r\n\r\nThat feature of the island of Eigg which renders it so remarkable\r\nand conspicuous an object on the west coast is the long ridge of the\r\nScuir. Rising gently from the valley which crosses the island from\r\nLaig Bay to the Harbour, the basaltic plateau ascends south-westwards\r\nin a succession of terraces, until along its upper part it forms a\r\nlong crest, from 900 to 1000 feet above the sea, to which it descends\r\non the other or south-west side, first by a sharp slope, and then by\r\na range of precipices. Along the watershed of this crest runs, in a\r\ngraceful double curve, the abrupt ridge of the Scuir, terminating\r\non the north-west at the edge of the great sea-cliff (975 feet), and\r\nending off on the south-east in that strange well-known mountain-wall\r\n(1272 feet high) which rises in a sheer cliff nearly 300 feet above\r\nthe basalt-plateau on the one side and more than 400 feet on the other\r\n(Fig. 278). The total length of the Scuir ridge is two miles and a\r\nquarter, its greatest breadth 1520, its least breadth 350 feet. Its\r\nsurface is very irregular, rising into minor hills and sinking into\r\nrock-basins, of which nine are small tarns, besides still smaller\r\npools, while six others, also filled with water, lie partly on the\r\nridge and partly on the basaltic plateau. No one, indeed, who looks\r\non the Scuir from below, and notes how evenly it rests upon the\r\nbasalt-plateau, would be prepared for so rugged a landscape as that\r\nwhich meets his eye everywhere along the top of the ridge. Two minor\r\narms project from the east side of the ridge; one of these forms the\r\nrounded hill called Beinn Tighe (968 feet), the other the hill of A\r\nchor Bheinn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 278.--View of the Scuir of Eigg from the east.]\r\n\r\nSingular as the Scuir of Eigg is, regarded merely as one of the\r\nlandmarks of the Hebrides, its geological history is not less peculiar.\r\nThe natural impression which arises in the mind when this mountain\r\ncomes into view for the first time is, that the huge wall is part of a\r\ngreat dyke or intrusive mass which has been thrust through the older\r\nrocks.[252] It was not until after some time that the influence of this\r\nfirst impression passed off my own mind, and the true structure of the\r\nmass became apparent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 252: Hay Cunningham remarks:--\"In regard to the relations of\r\nthe pitchstone-porphyry of the Scuir and the trap-rocks with which it\r\nis connected, it can, after a most careful examination around the whole\r\nmass, be confidently asserted that it exists as a great vein which\r\nhas been erupted through the other Plutonic rocks--thus agreeing in\r\nage with all the other pitchstones of the island.\" Macculloch leaves\r\nus to infer that he regarded the rock of the Scuir to be regularly\r\ninterstratified with the highest beds of the dolerite series (_Western\r\nIsles_, i. p. 522). Hugh Miller speaks of the Scuir of Eigg as \"resting\r\non the remains of a prostrate forest.\"--_Cruise of the Betsy_, p. 32.]\r\n\r\nThe ridge of the Scuir, presenting as it does so strong a\r\ntopographical contrast to the green terraced slopes of the\r\nplateau-basalts on which it rests, consists of some very distinct\r\nbands of black and grey lava, long known as \"pitchstone-porphyry.\" To\r\nthe nature and history of these rocks I shall return after we have\r\nconsidered a remarkable bed of conglomerate which lies below them. On\r\nthe lower or southern side of the ridge the bottom of the pitchstone,\r\ndipping into the hill, is exposed on the roof of a small cave where the\r\nends of its columns form a polygonal reticulation. It is there seen\r\nto repose upon a bed of breccia or conglomerate, having a pale-yellow\r\nor grey felspathic matrix like the more decomposing parts of the grey\r\ndevitrified parts of the pitchstone. Through this deposit are dispersed\r\ngreat numbers of angular and subangular pieces of pitchstone, some\r\nof which have a striped texture. Fragments of basalt, red (Torridon)\r\nsandstone, and other rocks are rare; and the bed suggests the idea that\r\nit is a kind of brecciated base or floor of the main pitchstone mass. A\r\nsimilar rock is found along the bottom of the pitchstone on both sides\r\nof the ridge (_c_, in Fig. 279). Here and there where this breccia is\r\nonly a yard or two in thickness, it consists of subangular fragments\r\nof the various dolerites and basalts of the neighbourhood, together\r\nwith pieces of red sandstone, quartzite, clay-slate, etc. The matrix\r\nis in some places a mass of hard basalt debris; in others it becomes\r\nmore calcareous, passing into a sandstone or grit in which chips and\r\nangular or irregular-shaped pieces of coniferous wood are abundant.[253]\r\nA little further east, beyond the base of the Scuir, a patch of similar\r\nbreccia is seen, but with the stones much more rounded and smoothed.\r\nThis outlier rests against the denuded ends of the basalt-beds forming\r\nthe side of the hill. Its interest arises from the evidence it affords\r\nof the prolongation of the deposit eastward, and consequently of the\r\nformer extension of the precipice of the Scuir considerably beyond its\r\npresent front.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 253: The microscopic structure of this wood was briefly\r\ndescribed by Witham (_Fossil Vegetables_, p. 37), and two magnified\r\nrepresentations were given to show its coniferous character. Lindley\r\nand Hutton further described it in their \"Fossil Flora,\" naming it\r\n_Pinites eiggensis_, and regarding it as belonging to the Oolitic\r\nseries of the Hebrides--an inference founded perhaps on the erroneous\r\nstatement of Witham to that effect. William Nicol corrected that\r\nstatement by showing that the wood-fragments occurred, not among the\r\n\"lias rocks,\" but \"among the debris of the pitchstone\" (_Edin. New\r\nPhil. Journal_, xviii. p. 154). Hay Cunningham, in the paper already\r\ncited, states that the fossil wood really lies in the pitchstone\r\nitself! The actual position of the wood, however, in the breccia and\r\nconglomerates underlying the pitchstone is beyond all dispute. I have\r\nmyself dug it out of the bed. The geological horizon assigned to this\r\nconifer, on account of its supposed occurrence among Oolitic rocks,\r\nbeing founded on error, no greater weight can be attached to the\r\nidentification of the plant with an Oolitic species. Our knowledge\r\nof the specific varieties of the microscopic structure of ancient\r\nvegetation is hardly precise enough to warrant us in definitely fixing\r\nthe horizon of a plant merely from the examination of the minute\r\ntexture of a fragment of its wood. From the internal organization of\r\nthe Eigg pine, there is no evidence that the fossil is of Jurassic age.\r\nFrom the position of the wood above the dolerites and underneath the\r\npitchstone of the Scuir it is absolutely certain that the plant is not\r\nof Jurassic but of Tertiary date.]\r\n\r\nIt is at the extreme north-western extremity of the pitchstone ridge,\r\nhowever, that the most remarkable exposure of this intercalated\r\ndetrital band is now to be seen. Sweeping along the crest of the\r\nplateau the ridge reaches the edge of the great precipice of Bideann\r\nBoidheach, by which its end is truncated, so as to lay open a section\r\nof the gravelly deposit along which the pitchstone flowed.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagram (Fig. 279) represents the natural section\r\nthere exposed. Rising over each other in successive beds, with a hardly\r\nperceptible southerly dip of 2°, the sheets of basalt form a mural\r\ncliff about 700 feet high. The bedded character of these rocks and\r\ntheir alternations of compact, columnar, amorphous and amygdaloidal\r\nbeds are here strikingly seen. They are traversed by veins and dykes\r\nof an exceedingly close-grained, sometimes almost flinty, basalt. But\r\nthe conspicuous feature of the cliff is the hollow which has been\r\nworn out of these rocks, and which, after being partially filled with\r\ncoarse conglomerate, has been buried under the huge pitchstone mass of\r\nthe Scuir. The conglomerate consists of water-worn fragments, chiefly\r\nof dolerite and basalt, but with some also of the white Jurassic\r\nsandstones, imbedded in a compacted sand derived from the waste of the\r\nolder volcanic rocks. The grey devitrified bands in the pitchstone, so\r\nconspicuous at the east end of the Scuir, here disappear and leave the\r\nconglomerate covered by one huge overlying mass of glassy pitchstone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 279.--Natural Section at the Cliff of Bideann\r\nBoidheach, north-west end of the Scuir of Eigg.\r\n\r\n_a a_, Bedded dolerites and basalts; _b_, basalt dykes and veins; _c_,\r\nancient river-bed filled with conglomerate; _p_, pitchstone of the\r\nScuir.]\r\n\r\nIf any doubt could arise as to the origin of the mass of detritus\r\nexposed under the pitchstone at the east end of the Scuir it would be\r\ndispelled by the section at the west end, which shows with unmistakable\r\nclearness that the conglomerate is a fluviatile deposit and lies in the\r\nactual channel of the ancient river which was eroded out of the basalt\r\nplateau, and was subsequently sealed up by streams of pitchstone-lava.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the fragments of rock found in the conglomerate\r\naffords here, as in Canna and Sanday, some indication of the direction\r\nin which the river flowed. The occurrence of pieces of red sandstone,\r\nwhich no one who knows West-Highland geology can fail to recognize\r\nas of Torridonian derivation, at once makes it clear that the higher\r\ngrounds from which they were borne probably lay to the north or\r\nnorth-east. The fragments of white sandstone may also have been\r\nderived from the same quarter, for the thick Jurassic series of Eigg\r\nonce extended further in that direction. The pieces of quartzite and\r\nclay-slate bear similar testimony to an eastern or north-eastern\r\nsource. In short, there seems every probability that this old Tertiary\r\nriver flowed through a forest-clad region, of which the red Torridon\r\nmountains of Ross-shire, the white sandstone cliffs of Raasay and Skye,\r\nand the quartzite and schist uplands of Western Inverness-shire are but\r\nfragments, that it passed over a wide and long tract of the volcanic\r\nplateau, and continued to flow long enough to be able to carve out for\r\nitself a channel on the surface of the basalt. Its course across what\r\nis now the island of Eigg took a somewhat north-westerly direction,\r\nprobably guided by inequalities on the surface of the lava-plain. It is\r\nthere marked by the winding ridge of the Scuir, the pitchstone of which\r\nflowed into the river-bed and sealed it up. Several minor spurs, which\r\nproject from the eastern side of the main ridge, show the positions\r\nof small tributary rivulets that entered the principal channel from\r\nthe slopes of the basaltic tableland. One of these, on the south-east\r\nside of the hill called Corven, must have been a gully in the basalt\r\nwith a rapid or waterfall. The pitchstone has flowed into it, and some\r\nof the rounded pebbles that lay in the channel of this vanished brook\r\nmay still be gathered where the degradation of the pitchstone has once\r\nmore exposed them to the light. That the Eigg river here flowed in a\r\nwesterly direction may be inferred from the angle at which the beds of\r\nthe small tributaries meet the main stream, and also from the fact that\r\nthe old river-bed at the east end of the Scuir is considerably higher\r\nthan at the west end.\r\n\r\nSeveral features in the geological structure of this locality serve to\r\nimpress on the mind the great lapse of time represented by the erosion\r\nof the river-channel of Eigg. Thus at the narrowest point of the\r\npitchstone ridge, near the little Loch a' Bhealaich, the bottom of the\r\nglassy lava is about 200 feet above its base on the south side, so that\r\nthe valley cut out of the plateau-basalts must have been more than 200\r\nfeet deep. Even the little tributaries had cut ravines or cañons in the\r\nbasalts before the ground was buried under the floods of pitchstone. In\r\nthe most northerly spur of the ridge, for example, the hill of Beinn\r\nTighe, which represents one of these tributaries, shows a considerable\r\ndifference between the level of the bottom of the pitchstone on the\r\neast and west sides.\r\n\r\nAgain, all along the ridge of the Scuir, the basalt-dykes are abruptly\r\ncut off at the denuded surface on which the pitchstone rests. This\r\nfeature is conspicuously displayed on the great sea-wall at the\r\nwest end (Fig. 279). The truncation of the dykes demonstrates that\r\na considerable mass of material must have been eroded before these\r\nlava-filled fissures could be laid bare at the surface. And the removal\r\nof this material shows that the denudation must have been continued for\r\na long period of time.\r\n\r\nThe river-channel of Eigg, since it was eroded long after the cessation\r\nof the outflows of basalt in the plateau of Small Isles, must be much\r\nlater in origin than those of Canna and Sanday which, as we have seen,\r\nwere contemporaneous with the basalt-eruptions. But the river that\r\nexcavated the channels and deposited the gravels may have been the same\r\nin both areas.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with this subject, though the evidence is admittedly scanty,\r\nwe are not left wholly to conjecture. A consideration of the general\r\ntopographical features of the wide region of the Inner Hebrides, from\r\nthe beginning of the volcanic period onward, will convince us that, in\r\nspite of the effects of prolonged basalt-eruptions, the persistent flow\r\nof the drainage of the Western Highlands must have taken a westerly\r\ndirection. It was towards the west that the low grounds lay. Though\r\nthe long and broad valley which stretched northwards from Antrim,\r\nbetween the line of the Outer Hebrides and the West of Scotland, was\r\ngradually buried under a depth of two or three thousand feet of lava,\r\nthe volcanic plain that overspread it probably remained even to the\r\nend lower than the mountainous Western Highlands. Hence the rivers,\r\nno matter how constantly they may have had their beds filled up and\r\nmay have been driven into new channels, would nevertheless always seek\r\ntheir way westwards into the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nOn Canna and Sanday the traces of a river are preserved which poured\r\nits flood-waters across the lava-fields in that part of the volcanic\r\nregion, while streams of basalt were still from time to time issuing\r\nfrom vents and fissures. Not more than fourteen miles to south-east\r\nstands the Scuir of Eigg, with its buried river-channel and its\r\nstriking evidence that there, also, a river flowed westwards, but at a\r\nfar later time, when the basalt-eruptions had ceased and the volcanic\r\nplain had been already deeply trenched by erosion, yet before the\r\nsubterranean fires were finally quenched, as the pitchstone of the\r\nScuir abundantly proves.\r\n\r\nWhen one reflects upon the enormous denudation of this region, to which\r\nmore special reference will be made in the sequel, one is not surprised\r\nthat many connecting links should have been effaced. The astonishment\r\nrather arises that so continuous a story can still be deciphered.\r\nEven, however, had the original record been left complete, it would\r\nhave been exceedingly difficult to trace the successive mutations of a\r\nriver-channel during long ages of volcanic eruptions. Such a channel\r\nwould have been concealed from view by each lava-stream that poured\r\ninto it, and would not have been again exposed save by the very process\r\nof erosion that destroys while it reveals.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, there is not and can never be any positive proof that\r\nin the fluviatile records of Canna, Sanday and Eigg successive phases\r\nare registered in the history of one single stream, I believe that this\r\nidentity is highly probable. It was a river which seems to have risen\r\namong the mountains of Western Inverness-shire, and it had doubtless\r\nalready taken its course to the sea before any volcanic eruptions\r\nbegan. It continued to flow westwards across the lava-floor that\r\ngradually spread over the plains. Its channel was constantly being\r\nfilled up by fresh streams of basalt or deflected by the uprise of new\r\ncinder-cones. But, fed by the Atlantic rains, it maintained its seaward\r\nflow until the general subsidence which carried so much of the volcanic\r\nplain below the sea. Yet the higher part of this ancient water-course\r\nis no doubt unsubmerged, still traversing the schists of the Western\r\nHighlands as it has done since older Tertiary time. It may, perhaps, be\r\nrecognized in one of the glens which carry seaward the drainage of the\r\ndistricts of Morar, Arisaig, or Moidart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 280.--View of the Scuir of Eigg from the South.]\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the remarkable lava which has sealed up the\r\nriver-channel of Eigg, and of which the remaining fragment stands up\r\nas the great ridge of the Scuir. This rock presents characters that\r\nstrongly distinguish it from the surrounding basalts. It is not one\r\nsingle uniform mass, but consists of a number of distinct varieties,\r\nsome of which are a volcanic glass, while others are a grey \"porphyry,\"\r\nor devitrified pitchstone. These are arranged in somewhat irregular,\r\nbut well-marked, and, in a general sense, horizontal sheets. On the\r\ngreat eastern terminal gable of the Scuir this bedded structure is not\r\nclearly displayed, for the cliff seems there to be built up of one\r\nhomogeneous mass, save a markedly columnar band that runs obliquely up\r\nthe base of the precipice (Fig. 278). If, however, the ridge is looked\r\nat from the south, the truly bedded character of its materials becomes\r\na conspicuous feature. Along the cliffs on that side the two varieties\r\nof rock are strongly distinguished by their contrasting colour and\r\nmode of weathering, the sombre-hued pitchstone standing up in a huge\r\nprecipice striped with columns, and barred horizontally with bands of\r\nthe pale-grey \"porphyry,\" which, from its greater proneness to decay,\r\nseems sunk into the face of the cliff. At the south-east end of the\r\nridge the bedding is especially distinct. West of the precipices, to\r\nthe south of the Loch a' Bhealaich, the dark pitchstone which forms the\r\nmain mass is divided by two long parallel intercalations of grey rock,\r\nand two other short lenticular seams of the same material (see Figs.\r\n280, 281). It is clear from these features, which are not seen by most\r\ntravellers who pass Eigg in the tourist-steamer that the Scuir is in\r\nno sense of the word a dyke.\r\n\r\nBut although the Scuir is thus a bedded mass, the bedding is far\r\ndifferent from the regularity and parallelism of that which obtains\r\namong the bedded basalt-rocks below. Even where no intervening\r\n\"porphyry\" occurs, the pitchstone can be recognized as made up of many\r\nbeds, each marked by the different angle at which its columns lie. And\r\nwhen the \"porphyry\" does occur and forms so striking a division in the\r\npitchstone, its beds die out rapidly, appearing now on one horizon, now\r\non another, along the face of the cliffs, and thickening and thinning\r\nabruptly in short distances along the line of the same bed. Perhaps the\r\nbest place for examining these features is at the Bhealaich, the only\r\ngully practicable for ascent or descent, at the south-eastern face of\r\nthe ridge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 281.--View of the Scuir of Eigg from the South-west\r\nof the Loch a' Bhealaich, showing the bedded character of the mass.]\r\n\r\nBy much the larger part of the mass of the Scuir consists of vitreous\r\nmaterial. As a rule this rock is columnar, the columns being much\r\nslimmer and shorter than those of the basalt-rocks. They rise sometimes\r\nvertically, and often obliquely, or project even horizontally from the\r\nface of the cliff. They are seldom quite straight, but have a wavy\r\noutline; and when grouped in knolls here and there along the top of\r\nthe ridge they remind one of gigantic bunches of some of the Palæozoic\r\ncorals, such as _Lithostrotion_. In other cases they slope out from\r\na common centre, and show an arrangement not very unlike that of a\r\nHighland peat-stack.\r\n\r\nThe pitchstone of the Scuir differs considerably in petrographical\r\ncharacter from other pitchstones of the island which occur in dykes\r\nand veins. Its base is of a velvet-black colour, and is so much less\r\nvitreous in aspect than ordinary pitchstone as to have been described\r\nby Jameson and later writers as intermediate between pitchstone and\r\nbasalt.[254] A chemical analysis of the rock by Mr. Barker North,[255] gave\r\nthe following composition:--\r\n\r\n  Silica              65·81\r\n  Alumina             14·01\r\n  Ferric oxide         4·43\r\n  Lime                 2·01\r\n  Magnesia             0·89\r\n  Soda                 4·15\r\n  Potash               6·08\r\n  Loss in ignition     2·70\r\n                     ------\r\n                     100·08\r\n\r\n[Footnote 254: _Mineralogy of the Scottish Isles_, vol. ii. p. 47. See\r\nalso Macculloch, _Western Isles_, vol. i. p. 521, and Hay Cunningham,\r\n_Mem. Wern. Soc._ vol. viii. p. 155.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 255: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlvi. (1890), p. 379.]\r\n\r\nThe grey devitrified bands, which occur as a subordinate part of\r\nthe mass of the Scuir ridge, are usually somewhat decomposed. Where\r\na fresh fracture is obtained, the material shows a fine-grained,\r\nsometimes almost flinty, grey felsitic base, containing clear granules\r\nof quartz, and facets of glassy felspar. In some places the rock is\r\nstrongly porphyritic. Examined under the microscope it presents a more\r\nthoroughly devitrified groundmass, with the minutest depolarizing\r\nmicrolites, large porphyritic crystals of plagioclase and sanidine,\r\ngrains of augite, and sometimes exceedingly abundant particles of\r\nmagnetite.[256]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 256: The microscopic structure of the identical pitchstone of\r\nHysgeir is given on p. 247.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 282.--Section at the base of the Scuir of Eigg\r\n(east end).]\r\n\r\nAlthough the line of separation between the grey dull felsitic sheets\r\nand the more ordinary glassy pitchstone is usually well defined,\r\nthe two rocks may be observed to shade into each other in such a\r\nmanner as to show that the lithoid material is only a devitrified and\r\nsomewhat decomposed condition of the glassy rock. This connection is\r\nparticularly to be observed under the precipice at the east end of the\r\nScuir. At that locality the pitchstone is underlain by a very hard\r\nflinty band, varying in colour from white through various shades of\r\nflesh-colour and brown into black, containing a little free quartz and\r\ncrystals of glassy felspar. Where it becomes black it passes into a\r\nrock like that of the main mass of the Scuir. Such vitreous parts of\r\nthe bed lie as kernels in the midst of the more lithoid and decomposed\r\nrock. The lower six feet of the \"porphyry\" are white and still more\r\ndecomposed. The relations of this mass are represented in Fig. 282,\r\nwhere the basalt-rocks of the plateau (_a_) are shown to be cut through\r\nby basalt dykes (_b b_), and overlain by the \"porphyry\" (_c_) and the\r\npitchstone (_d_). In the porphyry are shown several pitchstone kernels\r\n(_p_, _p_). It is deserving of remark also that in different parts\r\nof the Scuir, particularly along the north side, the bottom of the\r\npitchstone beds passes into a dull grey earthy lithoid substance, like\r\nthat now under description.\r\n\r\nThe bedded character of the rock of the Scuir and the well-marked\r\nlithological distinction between its several component sheets show the\r\nlava to have been the product of a number of separate outflows that\r\nfound their way one after another into the river-valley, which was the\r\nlowest ground in the vicinity of the active vent. There can be little\r\ndoubt, I think, that the lava flowed down the valley. Its successive\r\nstreams are still inclined from east to west. The vent of eruption,\r\ntherefore, ought to be looked for towards the east. Nowhere within the\r\nTertiary volcanic region is there any boss of pitchstone or any mass\r\nthe shape or size of which is suggestive of this vent. In the island of\r\nEigg no boss of any kind exists, save those of granophyric porphyry to\r\nbe afterwards referred to. But none of these affords any satisfactory\r\nlinks of connection with the rock of the Scuir. More probably the\r\nvent lay somewhere to the east on ground now overflowed by the sea.\r\nThe pitchstone veins of Eigg may represent some of the subterranean\r\nextrusions from the same volcanic pipe, and if so, its site could not\r\nbe far off.\r\n\r\nThe rock of the Scuir of Eigg has a special importance in the history\r\nof the volcanic plateaux. It is, so far as we know, the latest of all\r\nthe superficial lavas of Britain.[257] From the basalts on which it rests\r\nit was separated by an enormous interval of time, during which these\r\nolder lavas were traversed by dykes and were worn down into valleys.\r\nIts presence shows that long after the basalts of Small Isles had\r\nceased to be erupted, a new outbreak of volcanic activity took place in\r\nthis district, when lavas of a more acid composition flowed out at the\r\nsurface. Whether this outburst was synchronous with the appearance of\r\nthe great granophyric protrusions of the Inner Hebrides, or with the\r\nstill later extravasation of pitchstone dykes, can only be surmised.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 257: The rocks of Beinn Hiant in Ardnamurchan have been\r\nclaimed by Professor Judd as superficial lavas. For reasons to be\r\nafterwards given (p. 318) I regard them as intrusive sheets. Professor\r\nCole believes the rhyolites and pitchstones of Tardree to be probably\r\nevidence of a volcano later than the basalts of Antrim. As I have not\r\nbeen able to detect any actual proofs of superficial outflow there, I\r\nrelegate the description of the rocks to a future chapter, in which the\r\nacid protrusions will be discussed (p. 426).]\r\n\r\nWhen one scans the great precipice on the west side of Eigg, with\r\nits transverse section of the pitchstone-lava, buried river-bed and\r\nbasalt-plateau underneath, there seems no chance of any further\r\nwestward trace of the pitchstone being ever found. The truncated end\r\nof the Scuir looks from the top of the cliff out to sea, and the\r\nprogress of denudation might have been supposed to have effectually\r\ndestroyed all evidence of the continuation of the rock in a westerly\r\ndirection. Some years ago, however, my friend Prof. Heddle, while\r\ncruising among the Inner Hebrides, landed upon the little uninhabited\r\nislet of Hysgeir, which, some eighteen miles to the westward of Eigg,\r\nrises out of the open sea. He at once recognized the identity of the\r\nrock composing this islet with that of the Scuir, and in the year 1892\r\npublished a brief account of this interesting discovery.[258]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 258: Appendix C to _A Vertebrate Fauna of Argyle and the Inner\r\nHebrides_, by Messrs. J. A. Harvie-Brown and Thomas E. Buckley, p. 248.]\r\n\r\nI have myself been able to land on Hysgeir in two successive summers,\r\nand can entirely confirm Prof. Heddle's identification. The islet\r\nstands on the eastern edge of the submarine ridge which, running in a\r\nnorth-easterly direction, culminates in the island of Canna. Hysgeir\r\nis a mere reef or skerry, of which the top rises only 38 feet above\r\nthe Ordnance datum-level. Its surface is one of bare rock, save where\r\na short but luxuriant growth of grasses has found root on the higher\r\nparts of two or three of its ridges, and on the old storm-beach of\r\nshingle which remains on the summit. The rock undulates in long low\r\nswells, that run in a general direction 20° to 45° west of north, and\r\nare separated by narrow channels or hollows. The place is a favourite\r\nhaunt of gulls, terns, eider-ducks and grey seals, and is used by the\r\nproprietor of Canna for the occasional pasturage of sheep or cattle.\r\nSo numerous are the sea-fowl during the breeding-season that the\r\ngeologist, intent upon his own pursuits, may often tread on their nests\r\nunawares, while he is the centre of a restless circle of white wings\r\nand anxious cries.\r\n\r\nThe pitchstone of Hysgeir, like that of Eigg, is columnar, the columns\r\nbeing irregularly polygonal and varying from three to ten inches in\r\ndiameter. They are packed so close together that the domes of rock on\r\nwhich their ends appear look like rounded masses of honeycomb. They may\r\nhere and there be observed to be arranged radially with their ends at\r\nright angles to the curved exterior of the ridges, as if this external\r\nsurface represented the original form of the cooled pitchstone, and\r\nwere not due to mere denudation. There can be no doubt, however, that\r\nthe island has been well ice-worn.\r\n\r\nAt the north-west promontory a beautiful example of fan-shaped grouping\r\nof columns may be observed on a face of rock which descends vertically\r\ninto the sea. Here, too, is almost the only section on which the sides\r\nof the columns may be examined, for, as a rule, it is merely their ends\r\non the rounded domes which are to be observed, and which everywhere\r\nslip under the waves. The columns in a cliff from 15 to 20 feet high\r\nshow the slightly wavy, starch-like arrangement so often to be met with\r\namong the plateau-basalts.\r\n\r\nThe rock presents a tolerably uniform texture throughout, though\r\nin some parts it is blacker, more resinous, and less charged with\r\nporphyritic enclosures than in the general body of the rock. Large\r\nfresh felspars are generally scattered through it. To the naked eye it\r\nreproduces every feature of the pitchstone of the Scuir of Eigg.\r\n\r\nA microscopic examination completes our recognition of the identity of\r\nthese two rocks. Mr. Harker has examined a thin slice prepared from the\r\nHysgeir pitchstone, and remarks regarding it that \"the large felspars\r\nare not the only porphyritic element. The microscope shows the presence\r\nalso of smaller imperfect crystals of augite, very faint green in the\r\nslice, and small grains of magnetite. The felspars have been deeply\r\ncorroded by the enveloping magma, and irregular included patches of the\r\ngroundmass occupy nearly half the bulk of some of the crystals. This\r\nlatter feature is seen especially in some of the larger crystals, which\r\nseem to be sanidine. They are, for the most part, apparently simple\r\ncrystals, but in places there is a scarcely defined lamellar twinning,\r\nor, again, small patches not extinguishing with the rest; so that\r\nwe are probably dealing with some perthitic intergrowth on a minute\r\nscale.[259]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 259: Comp. Prof. Judd's remarks on the Scuir of Eigg rock,\r\n_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlvi. (1890), p. 380.]\r\n\r\n\"Rather smaller felspar-crystals are rounded by corrosion, but\r\nlack the inclusions of groundmass; these have albite-and sometimes\r\npericline-lamellation, and may be referred to oligoclase-andesine.\r\nThe groundmass of the rock is a brown glass with perlitic cracks,\r\nenclosing very numerous microlites of felspar about ·001 inch in length\r\n[6619]. The rock is probably to be regarded as a dacite rather than a\r\nrhyolite, and thus agrees with Mr. Barker North's analysis of the Eigg\r\npitchstone.\"[260]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 260: _Op. cit._ p. 379.]\r\n\r\nThere is no trace of any conglomerate _in situ_ like that under the\r\nScuir of Eigg, nor of any other rock, aqueous or igneous. As the\r\npitchstone everywhere slips under the sea, its geological relations are\r\nentirely concealed.\r\n\r\nThe great variety of materials met with in the form of boulders on\r\nthe island is a testimony to the transport of erratics from the\r\nneighbouring islands and the mainland during the Glacial Period. The\r\nmost abundant rock in these boulders is Torridon Sandstone, derived\r\nno doubt from the hills of Rum, but there occur also various kinds of\r\nschist, gneisses, quartzites, granites, porphyries, probably from the\r\nwest of Inverness-shire, as well as pieces of white sandstone, probably\r\nJurassic, which may have come from Eigg.\r\n\r\nThat the pitchstone of Hysgeir is a continuation of that of the Scuir\r\nmay be regarded as highly probable. If not a continuation, it must be\r\nanother stream of the same kind, and doubtless of the same date. If\r\nit be regarded as probably a westward prolongation of the Eigg rock,\r\nand if it be about as thick as that mass at the west end of the Scuir,\r\nthen its bottom lies 200 or 300 feet under the waves. The river-channel\r\noccupied by the Eigg pitchstone undoubtedly sloped from east to west.\r\nThe position of Hysgeir, 18 miles further west, may indicate a further\r\nfall in the same direction at the rate of perhaps as much as 35 feet in\r\nthe mile.[261] Unfortunately, however, as no trace of the river-bed can\r\nnow be seen on this island, any statement in regard to it must rest on\r\nmere conjecture.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 261: _Rep. Brit. Assoc._ 1894, p. 653.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the question of the denudation of the basalt-plateaux since\r\nthe close of the volcanic period will be the subject of a special\r\nchapter in a later part of this volume, I cannot here refrain from\r\ncalling attention to the pitchstone of Eigg and Hysgeir as one of the\r\nmost impressive monuments of denudation to be found within the British\r\nIsles. Though now so prominent an object in the West Highlands, this\r\nrock once occupied the bottom of a valley worn out of the basaltic\r\ntableland. Prolonged and stupendous denudation has destroyed the\r\nconnection with its source, has cut down its ends into beetling\r\nprecipices, has reduced the former surrounding hills into gentle slopes\r\nand undulating lowland, and has turned the bottom of the ancient valley\r\ninto a long, narrow and high crest. Moreover, we see that the erosion\r\nhas not been uniform. The great wall of the Scuir does not stand fairly\r\non the crest of the basalt-plateau but on the south side of it, so that\r\nthe southern half of the old valley, with all its surrounding hills,\r\nhas been entirely cut away. That subsidence has also come into play in\r\nthe destruction of even the youngest parts of the volcanic plateaux\r\nwill be more fully discussed in a later chapter. I need only remark\r\nhere that the submergence of Hysgeir probably points to extensive\r\ndepression of the land-surface on which the lavas were poured out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n          THE BASALT-PLATEAUX OF SKYE AND OF THE FAROE ISLES\r\n\r\n\r\n                         iv. THE SKYE PLATEAU\r\n\r\nThis largest and geologically most important of all the Scottish\r\nplateaux comprises the island of Skye, at least as far south as Loch\r\nEishort, and the southern half of Raasay, but is shown by its sills\r\nto stretch as far as the Shiant Isles on the north, and the Point of\r\nSleat on the south (see Map VI.). It may be reckoned to embrace an area\r\nof not less than 800 square miles. The evidence that its limits, like\r\nthose of the other plateaux, are now greatly less than they originally\r\nwere, is abundant and impressive. The truncated edges of its basalts,\r\nrising here and there for a thousand feet as a great sea-wall above the\r\nbreakers at their base, and presenting everywhere their succession of\r\nlevel or gently inclined bars, are among the most impressive monuments\r\nof denudation in this country. But still more striking to the geologist\r\nis the proof, furnished beyond the margins of the plateau, that the\r\nJurassic and other older rocks there visible were originally buried\r\ndeep under the basalt-sheets, which have thus been entirely stripped\r\noff that part of the country.\r\n\r\nThroughout most of the district, wherever the base of the basalts can\r\nbe seen, it is found to rest upon some member of the Jurassic series,\r\nbut with a complete unconformability. The underlying sedimentary strata\r\nhad been dislocated and extensively denuded before the volcanic period\r\nbegan. On the southern margin, however, the red (Torridon) sandstones\r\nemerge from under the basalts of Loch Scavaig, and extending into\r\nthe island of Soay are prolonged under the sea into Rum. This ridge\r\nprobably represents the range of the ancient high ground of the latter\r\nisland already referred to.\r\n\r\nNowhere are the distinctive topographical features and geological\r\nstructure of the basalt-plateaux better displayed than in the northern\r\nhalf of the island of Skye. The green terraced slopes, with their\r\nparallel bands of brown rock formed by the outcrop of the nearly flat\r\nbasalt-beds, rise from the bottoms of the valleys into flat-topped\r\nridges and truncated cones (Fig. 283). The hills everywhere present\r\na curiously tabular form that bears witness to the horizontal sheets\r\nof rock of which they are composed.[262] And along the sea-precipices,\r\neach excessive sheet of basalt can be counted from base to summit,\r\nand followed from promontory to promontory (Figs. 284, 286). In the\r\ndistrict of Trotternish, the basalt hills reach a height of 2360 feet.\r\nFurther west, the singular flat-topped eminences, called \"Macleod's\r\nTables\" (Fig. 283) ascend to 1600 feet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 262: These features are more fully described in my _Scenery of\r\nScotland_, 2nd edit (1887), pp. 74, 145, 216.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 283.--Terraced Hills of Basalt Plateau (Macleod's\r\nTables), Skye.]\r\n\r\nAlong the western side of Skye, the basalts descend beneath the level\r\nof the Atlantic, save at Eist in Duirinish, where the Secondary strata,\r\nwith their belt of intrusive sills, rise from underneath them, and at\r\nthe Sound of Soa, where they rest on the Torridon Sandstone. Along\r\nthe eastern side, their base runs on the top of the great Jurassic\r\nescarpment, whose white and yellow sandstones rise there, and on the\r\neast side of Raasay, into long lines of pale cliffs. To the south-east,\r\nthe regularity of the volcanic plateau is effaced, as in Mull and\r\nArdnamurchan, by the protrusion of extensive masses of eruptive rocks\r\nconstituting the Cuillin and Red Hills, east of which the basalts have\r\nbeen almost entirely removed by denudation, so as to expose the older\r\nrocks which they once covered, and through which the younger eruptive\r\nbosses made their way. This is undoubtedly the most instructive\r\ndistrict for the study of that late phase in the volcanic history of\r\nBritain comprised in the eruptive bosses of basic and acid rocks.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent plateau of this island has been so profoundly cut down\r\ninto glens and arms of the sea, and its component layers are exposed\r\nalong so many leagues of precipice, that its structure is perhaps more\r\ncompletely laid open than that of any of the other Tertiary volcanic\r\nareas in Britain. It is built up of a succession of basalts and\r\ndolerites of the usual types, which still reach a thickness of more\r\nthan 2000 feet, though in this instance, also, denudation has left\r\nonly a portion of them, without any evidence by which to reckon what\r\ntheir total original depth may have been. In rambling over Skye, the\r\ngeologist is more than ever struck with the remarkable scarcity and\r\ninsignificance of the interstratifications of tuff or of any other\r\nkind of sedimentary deposit between the successive lava-sheets. One\r\nof the thickest accumulations of volcanic tuff and conglomerate has\r\nalready been referred to as occurring on the south side of Portree\r\nHarbour, where it attains a depth of about 200 feet. As it is in\r\nimmediate connection with its parent vent, it will be more fully\r\nalluded to in Chapter xli. Here, as is so generally observable among\r\nthe basalt-plateaux, traces of vegetation are plentiful among the\r\nstratified intercalations, even forming thin seams of lignite and coal,\r\none of which was formerly worked. That volcanic eruptions, though\r\npossibly of a feebler kind, continued during the interval between the\r\nbasalt-outflows at this locality, is shown by the thick accumulation\r\nof tuff and by the occurrence of abundant lapilli of fine basic pumice\r\namong the shales, even to a distance of several miles from the vent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 284.--\"Macleod's Maidens\" and part of Basalt Cliffs\r\nof Skye.]\r\n\r\nAnother conspicuous intercalation of sedimentary materials in the Skye\r\nplateau occurs on the Talisker cliffs at the mouth of Loch Bracadale,\r\nwhere, on the face of the great precipice of Rudha nan Clach, some\r\nconspicuous bands of lilac and red are interspersed among the basalts.\r\nThese bands were noticed by Macculloch, who described them as varieties\r\nof \"iron-clay.\"[263] I have not had an opportunity of examining them\r\nexcept from the sea at a little distance. But they suggest a similarity\r\nto some of the variegated clays between the upper and lower basalt\r\nseries of Antrim.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 263: _Western Islands_, vol. i. p. 376.]\r\n\r\nThough good coal is not well developed in the Tertiary volcanic\r\nplateaux of the British Isles, it has already been pointed out that\r\ncoaly layers are abundant, and that as the vegetable matter may\r\nconfidently be assumed always to indicate terrestrial vegetation, the\r\npresence of the carbonaceous bands may be regarded as good evidence\r\nof some lapse of time between the eruption of the basalts which they\r\nseparate. I have also called attention to the fact that the vegetable\r\nmaterial is more especially observable in the highest parts of a\r\ngroup of intercalated sediments between two sheets of basalt. This\r\nrelation, so strikingly exhibited in the isle of Canna, as already\r\nobserved, is also to be remarked in the Skye plateau. I may here cite\r\nan interesting example which occurs at the base of the lofty sea-cliff\r\nof An Ceannaich, to the south of Dunvegan Head, on the west coast of\r\nSkye (Fig. 285). At the base of the precipice, ledges of a highly\r\ncellular basalt (_a_) show a singularly scoriaceous and amygdaloidal\r\nstructure, with abundant and beautiful zeolites, the hollows of the\r\nupper surface of the sheet being filled in with dark brown carbonaceous\r\nshale, forming a layer from one to fourteen inches thick, marked by\r\ncoaly streaks and lenticles (_b_). A band of green and yellow sandstone\r\n(_c_) next supervenes, which, from its pale colour, attracts attention\r\nfrom a distance, and led me, while yachting along the coast, to land\r\nat the locality in the hope that it might prove to be a plant-bearing\r\nlimestone. This sandy stratum is only some three or four inches thick\r\nat the north end of the section, but increases rapidly southward to a\r\nthickness of as many feet or more, when, owing to the cessation of the\r\nunderlying shale, it comes to lie directly on the amygdaloid and to\r\nenclose slaggy portions of that rock. Immediately above the sandstone\r\ntwo or three feet of fissile shale, black with plant-remains (_d_),\r\ninclude brown layers that yield to the knife like some oil-shales. The\r\nnext stratum is a seam of coal (_e_) about a foot thick, of remarkable\r\npurity. It is glossy, hard, and cubical, including layers that break\r\nlike jet. It has been succeeded by a deposit of green sand (_f_), but\r\nwhile this material was in course of deposition another outpouring of\r\nlava (_g_) took place, whereby the terrestrial pool or hollow of the\r\nlava-field, in which the group of sedimentary materials accumulated,\r\nwas filled up and buried. This lava is about 20 feet thick, and\r\nconsists of a coarsely-crystalline, jointed dolerite with highly\r\namygdaloidal upper and under surface. Its slaggy bottom has caught\r\nup or pushed aside the layer of green sand, so as to lie directly on\r\nthe coal, and has there been converted into the earthy modification\r\nso familiar under the name of \"white trap\" among our coal-fields. It\r\nis interesting to find that this kind of alteration, where molten\r\nrock comes in contact with carbonaceous materials, is not confined to\r\nsubterranean sills, but may show itself in lavas that have flowed over\r\na terrestrial surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 285.--Intercalated group of strata between Basalts, An\r\n  Ceannaich, western side of Skye.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom the frequent intercalation of such local deposits of sedimentary\r\nmaterial between the basalts, we may reasonably infer that during older\r\nTertiary time the rainfall in North-Western Europe was copious enough\r\nto supply many little lakes and streams of water. As the surface of\r\nthe lava-fields decayed into soil, vegetation spread over it, so that,\r\nperhaps for long intervals, some tracts remained green and forest-clad.\r\nBut volcanic action still continued to show itself, now from one vent,\r\nnow from another. These wooded tracts were buried under overflows of\r\nlava, and, the water-courses being filled up, their streams were driven\r\ninto new channels, and other pools and lakes were formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 286.--Escarpment of Plateau-basalts, Cliffs of\r\nTalisker, Skye.]\r\n\r\nIn no part of the Tertiary volcanic area of Britain can the characters\r\nof the lavas and the structure of the plateaux be better seen than\r\nalong the west side of Skye, north of Loch Bracadale. The precipices\r\nrise sheer out of the sea, to heights of sometimes 1000 feet, and from\r\nbase to summit every individual bed may be counted. Some particulars\r\nhave already been given (p. 192) regarding the average thickness of the\r\nbasalt-sheets on this coast-line. The general aspect of these cliffs\r\nand the arrangement of their component lavas is shown in Fig. 286.\r\nAs a further detailed illustration of the general succession of the\r\nbasalts in the Skye plateau, I give a diagrammatic view of the largest\r\nof Macleod's Maidens--the three weird sea-stalks that rise so grandly\r\nin front of the storm-swept precipice at the mouth of Loch Bracadale.\r\nThe height of the stack must be at least 150 feet (Figs. 284 and 287).\r\nAbout ten distinct sheets of igneous rock can be counted in it, which\r\ngives an average thickness of 15 feet for the individual beds. It will\r\nbe observed that there is a kind of alternation between the compact,\r\nprismatic basalts and the more earthy amygdaloids, but that the former\r\nare generally thickest.[264]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 264: A striking and illustrative contrast between the relative\r\nthickness of the beds of the two kinds of rock is supplied by the fine\r\nsections of this district. The amygdaloids range from perhaps 6 or 8\r\nto 25 or 30 feet; but the prismatic basalts, while never so thin as\r\nthe others, sometimes enormously exceed them in bulk. In the island of\r\nWiay, for example, a bed of compact black basalt, with the confused\r\nstarch-like grouping of columns, reaches a thickness of no less than\r\n170 feet. Its bottom rests upon a red parting on the top of a dull\r\ngreenish earthy amygdaloid. It is possible, however, that some of these\r\ncolumnar sheets of basalt are really sills.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 287.--Section of the largest of Macleod's Maidens.]\r\n\r\nThese features, which are repeated on cliff after cliff, may be\r\nconsidered typical for all the plateaux. Another characteristic point,\r\nwell displayed here, is the intervening red parting between the\r\nsuccessive beds. If the occurrence and thickness of this layer could\r\nbe assumed as an indication of the relative lapse of time between\r\nthe different flows of lava, it would furnish us with a rude kind of\r\nchronometer for estimating the proportionate duration of the intervals\r\nbetween the eruptions. It is to be noticed on the top both of the\r\ncompact prismatic and of the earthy amygdaloidal sheets; but it is more\r\nfrequent and generally thicker on the latter than on the former, which\r\nmay only mean that the surfaces of the cellular lavas were more prone\r\nto subærial decay than those of the compact varieties. Nevertheless,\r\nI am disposed to attach some value to it, as an index of time. In the\r\npresent instance, for example, it seems to me probable that the lavas\r\nin the lower half of Macleod's Maiden, where the red layers are very\r\nprominent, were poured out at longer intervals than those that form the\r\nupper half. The remarkable banded arrangement of the vesicles in one of\r\nthe cellular lavas of this sea-stack has been already referred to (p.\r\n191).\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic plateau-feature is admirably displayed in\r\nSkye--the flatness of the basalts and the continuity of their level\r\nterraces (though not of individual sheets) from cliff to cliff and\r\nhillside to hillside. This feature may be followed with almost tiresome\r\nmonotony over the whole of the island, north of a line drawn from Loch\r\nBrittle to Loch Sligachan. Throughout that wide region, the regularity\r\nof the basalt-plateau is unbroken, except by minor protrusions of\r\neruptive rock, which, as far as I have noticed, do not seriously affect\r\nthe topography. But south of the line just indicated, the plateau\r\nundergoes the same remarkable change as in Rum, Ardnamurchan and Mull.\r\nPortions of it which have survived indicate with sufficient clearness\r\nthat it once spread southwards and eastwards over the mountainous\r\ndistrict, and even farther south into the low parts of the island. Its\r\nremoval from that tract has been of the utmost value to geological\r\nresearch, for some of the subterranean aspects of volcanism have\r\nthereby been revealed, which would otherwise have remained buried under\r\nthe thick cover of basalt. Denudation has likewise cut deeply into the\r\neruptive bosses, and has carved out of them the groups of the Red Hills\r\nand the Cuillins, to whose picturesque forms Skye owes so much of its\r\ncharm.\r\n\r\nIn this, as in each of the other plateaux, there is no trace of\r\nany thickening of the basalts towards a supposed central vent of\r\neruption. The nearly level sheets may be followed up to the very\r\nedge of the great mountainous tract of eruptive rocks, retaining all\r\nthe way their usual characters; they do not become thicker there\r\neither collectively or individually, nor are they more abundantly\r\ninterstratified with tuffs or volcanic conglomerates. On the contrary,\r\ntheir very base is exposed around the mountain ground, and the thickest\r\ninterstratifications of fragmentary materials are found at a distance\r\nfrom that area. So far as regards the structure of the remaining part\r\nof the plateau, the eruption of the gabbros and granitoid rocks might\r\napparently have taken place as well anywhere further north.\r\n\r\n\r\nv. THE FAROE ISLANDS[265]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 265: For references to the recent geological literature\r\nconnected with these islands see the footnote _ante_, p. 191.]\r\n\r\nThough these islands lie beyond the limits of the region embraced by\r\nthe present work, I wish to cite them for the singular confirmation\r\nand extension they afford to observations made among British Tertiary\r\nvolcanic rocks. Over a united extent of coast-cliffs which may be\r\nroughly estimated at about 500 English miles, the nearly level sheets\r\nof basalts, with their occasional tuffs, conglomerates, leaf-beds and\r\ncoals, can be followed with singular clearness. Although the Faroe\r\nIslands have been so frequently visited and so often described that\r\ntheir general structure is sufficiently well known, they present in\r\ntheir details such a mass of new material for the illustration of\r\nvolcanic action that they deserve a far more minute and patient survey\r\nthan they have yet received. They cannot be adequately mapped and\r\nunderstood by the traveller who merely sails round them. They must be\r\nlaboriously explored, island by island and cliff by cliff.\r\n\r\nWhile I cannot pretend to more than a mere general acquaintance\r\nwith their structure, I have learnt by experience that one may sail\r\nnear their precipices and yet miss some essential features of their\r\nvolcanic structure. In the summer of the year 1894 I passed close to\r\nthe noble range of precipices on the west side of Stromö, at the mouth\r\nof the Vaagöfjord, and sketched the sill which forms so striking a\r\npart of the geology of that district (Figs. 312, 328 and 329). But I\r\nfailed to observe a much more remarkable and interesting feature at\r\nthe base of the same sea-cliffs. The following summer, probably under\r\nbetter conditions of light, I was fortunate enough to detect with my\r\nfield-glass, from the deck of the yacht, what looked like a mass of\r\nagglomerate, and found on closer examination the interesting group of\r\nvolcanic vents described in Chapter xli. The magnificent precipices\r\nof Faroe, which in Myling Head reach a height of 2260 feet, present\r\na series of natural sections altogether without a rival in the rest\r\nof Europe. They are less concealed with verdure than those of Mull\r\nand Skye, and therefore display their geological details with even\r\ngreater clearness than can be found either in Scotland or in Ireland.\r\nI would especially refer to the bare precipitous sides of the long\r\nnarrow islands of Kalsö and Kunö, as admirable sections wherein the\r\ncharacters of the plateau-basalts are revealed as in a series of\r\ngigantic diagrams. The scarcity of vegetation, and the steepness of\r\nthe declivities which prevents the abundant accumulation of screes\r\nof detritus, enable the observer to trace individual beds of basalt\r\nwith the eye for several miles. Thus on the west side of Kunö, one\r\nconspicuous dark sheet in the lower part of the section can be followed\r\nfrom opposite Mygledahl in Kalsö to the southern end of the island.\r\nThere is one concealed space at the mouth of the corrie behind Kunö\r\nvillage, but the same, or at least a similar band of rock at the same\r\nlevel, emerges from the detritus on the further side, and may possibly\r\nrun into the opposite promontory of Bodö. It extends in Kunö for at\r\nleast six geographical miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 288.--Dying out of Lava-beds, east side of Sandö,\r\nFaroe Isles.]\r\n\r\nThese vast escarpments of naked rock show, with even greater clearness\r\nthan the precipices of the Inner Hebrides, how frequently the basalts\r\ndie out, now in one direction now in another. The two sides of the\r\nKalsöfjord exhibit many examples of this structure, and some striking\r\ninstances of it are to be seen on the west side of Haraldsfjord. In\r\nthese cliffs, which must be about 2000 feet high, upwards of forty\r\ndistinct flows can sometimes be traced from the sea-level to the crest.\r\nThe average thickness of each bed is thus somewhat less than 50 feet.\r\nSuch vast escarpments, with wide semicircular corries scooped out of\r\ntheir sides, such serrated crests and dark rifts in the precipices,\r\nsuch deep fjords winding through nearly horizontal basalts, of which\r\nthe parallel sheets can be followed by the eye from island to island,\r\nfill the mind with a vivid conception at once of the enormous scale\r\nof the volcanic eruptions and of the stupendous denudation which this\r\nportion of North-Western Europe has undergone since Tertiary time.\r\n\r\nAs the lenticular character of the basalts, and the evidence they\r\nsupply of having been discharged from many small local vents are of\r\ngreat importance in the comprehension of the volcanic history of\r\nthe plateaux, some further illustrations of these features may with\r\nadvantage be given here. Thus the traveller who skirts the western\r\nprecipices of Suderö will notice some good examples to the north of\r\nthe highest part of the cliffs. On Stromö he will detect other cases\r\nof the same structure. Similar features will arrest his attention on\r\nthe precipices of Sandö, where, though at first sight the basalts\r\nseem to be regular and continuous, a nearer view of them reveals such\r\nsections as that shown in Fig. 288, where a group of sheets rapidly\r\ndies out towards the north against a thicker band that thins away in\r\nthe opposite direction. Further north he will come upon other examples\r\nin the range of low cliffs between Kirkebonaes and Thorshaven, and more\r\nimpressive still in the rugged precipices that front the Atlantic on\r\nthe western front of Hestö (Fig. 289), where the disappearance is in a\r\nnortherly direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 289.--Lenticular lavas, western front of Hestö,\r\nFaroe Isles.]\r\n\r\nBut it is in the northern part of the Faroes, where the basalt-plateau\r\nhas been so deeply trenched by parallel fjords as to be broken up into\r\na group of long, narrow, lofty, and precipitous insular ridges, that\r\nthe really local and non-persistent character of the lavas can best be\r\nseen. The eastern cliffs of Svinö present admirable examples, where\r\nin the same vertical wall of rock some of the basalts die out to the\r\nsouth, others to the north, while occasionally a shorter sheet may be\r\nseen to disappear in both directions as if it were the end of a stream\r\nthat flowed at right angles to the others (Fig. 290).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 290.--Lenticular lavas east side of Svinö, Faroe\r\nIsles.]\r\n\r\nThe more the basalt-plateaux of Britain and the Faroe Islands are\r\nstudied, the more certain does the conclusion become that these\r\nwidespread sheets of lava never flowed from a few large central\r\nvolcanoes of the type of Etna or Vesuvius, but were emitted from\r\ninnumerable minor vents or from open fissures. In a later chapter an\r\naccount will be given of the vents, which may still be seen under the\r\noverlying sheets of basalt, and, in particular, a remarkable group in\r\nthe Faroe Islands will be described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 291.--Section at Frodbonyp, Suderö, Faroe.]\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of tuffs, leaf-beds and thin coals between the\r\nplateau-basalts of the Faroe Islands has long been known. These\r\nstratified deposits are well seen in the island of Suderö, where they\r\nserve to divide two distinct series of basalts, like the iron-ore and\r\nits accompaniments in Antrim. As a characteristic illustration of the\r\nsame diversity of deposits observable between the lava-sheets of the\r\nbasalt-plateaux of the British Isles I give here a section exposed on\r\nthe east side of this island--a locality often visited and described\r\nin connexion with its coal-seams (Fig. 291). At the base lies a sheet\r\nof basalt (_a_) with an irregularly lumpy upper surface. It may be\r\nremarked that the lower group of basalts is marked by the occurrence of\r\nnumerous columnar sheets, some of them possibly sills, and also more\r\nmassive, solid, and durable basalts than the sheets above. The lowest\r\nof the intercalated sediments are light-coloured clays, passing down\r\ninto dark nodular mudstone and dark shale, the whole having a thickness\r\nof at least 20 feet (_b_). These strata are succeeded by (_c_) pale\r\nclays with black plant-remains, about three feet thick. Immediately\r\nabove this band comes the coal or coaly layer (_d_), here about six\r\ninches thick, which improves in thickness and quality further inland,\r\nwhere it has been occasionally worked for economic purposes. A deposit\r\nof green and brown volcanic mudstone (_e_), twelve feet in thickness,\r\noverlies the coal and passes under a well-bedded granular green tuff\r\nand mudstone three feet thick (_f_). The uppermost band is another\r\nvolcanic mudstone (_g_) four feet in thickness, dark green in colour,\r\nand more or less distinctly stratified, with irregular concretions, and\r\nalso pieces of wood. Above this layer comes another thick overlying\r\ngroup of basalts (_h_) distinguished by their abundantly amygdaloidal\r\ncharacter, and by their weathering into globular forms which at a\r\nlittle distance give them a resemblance to agglomerates.\r\n\r\nWe have here an intercalated group of strata upwards of 40 feet thick,\r\nconsisting partly of tuffs and partly of fine clays, which may either\r\nhave been derived from volcanic explosions or from the atmospheric\r\ndisintegration of basaltic lavas. Through some of these strata abundant\r\ncarbonaceous streaks and other traces of plants are distributed,\r\nwhile among them lies a band almost wholly composed of compressed\r\nvegetation. Unfortunately none of the strata at this locality seem\r\nto have preserved the plant-remains with sufficient definiteness\r\nfor identification. There can be no doubt, however, that they were\r\nterrestrial forms like those of Mull and Antrim.\r\n\r\nThis coal, with its accompanying sedimentary deposits, has been traced\r\nthrough Suderö, and another outcrop, possibly of the same horizon,\r\noccurs on Myggenaes, the extreme western member of the group of\r\nislands, at a distance of some 40 miles.[266]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 266: See in particular Prof. J. Geikie, _Trans. Roy. Soc.\r\nEdin._ vol. xxx. (1880), p. 229.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n        THE MODERN VOLCANOES OF ICELAND AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE\r\n           TERTIARY VOLCANIC HISTORY OF NORTH-WESTERN EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the facts stated in the foregoing chapters concerning the\r\nstructure of the basalt-plateaux of North-Western Europe, it is evident\r\nthat in none of these areas have the eruptions come from one great\r\ncentral volcano like Etna or Vesuvius. On the contrary, in every\r\ninstance there is abundant evidence that the basalt has flowed from\r\nmany scattered points of eruption. The uniformity of the lava-sheets in\r\npetrographical characters, their continuity when viewed in mass, their\r\ngeneral horizontality, and their constant thinning away in different\r\ndirections, show that the eruptive vents must have been distributed\r\nover the whole plateau-areas.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which such eruptions took place can be most\r\nreadily understood by a comparison of the phenomena with those\r\nobservable in modern volcanic tracts where extensive outflows of lava\r\nhave taken place without the existence of any great central cones. Of\r\nthese regions the most instructive is undoubtedly to be found among the\r\nrecent lava-deserts of Iceland. There the parallels to the structures\r\ndescribed from the British and Faroe plateaux are so numerous and so\r\nclose that an account of the Icelandic region may appropriately be\r\ninserted here.\r\n\r\nThe evidence furnished by Iceland is of special value in our present\r\nenquiry, inasmuch as that island, besides its modern eruptions,\r\nincludes vast basaltic plateaux of Tertiary age. These areas of nearly\r\nlevel sheets of basalt belong to the same geological period as those of\r\nthe British and Faroe Islands, and display the same internal structure\r\nand external features. But they have this distinguishing peculiarity\r\nthat the volcanic fires beneath them are not yet extinguished. They\r\nhave been broken through again and again in recent times by volcanic\r\neruptions which have repeated many of the characteristics of their\r\nTertiary predecessors. The old and the new development of the same\r\nvolcanic type are thus visible side by side.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary volcanic series of Iceland reaches a thickness of\r\nupwards of 3000 metres, or nearly 10,000 English feet, but as its\r\nbase is nowhere seen, it may be still thicker. Its successive sheets,\r\npiled over each other in parallel layers, form terraced hills and\r\nbold escarpments along the coast, whence they slope gently inland.\r\nThe plateau, as in the Faroe Islands and in Scotland, has been\r\nextensively eroded, and has been trenched by many long valleys and\r\nfjords The composition of the basalts remains remarkably uniform over\r\nthe island. The lava sheets are often decomposing, amygdaloidal, and\r\nfilled with zeolites; while higher in the series compact basalts\r\nabound, the uppermost fine-grained sheets being especially constant\r\nin structure and composition. Numerous dykes traverse the plateau,\r\nand some of them cut even its highest members. The parallel with the\r\ngeological structure of the Inner Hebrides is continued in Iceland by\r\nthe appearance of intrusive masses of gabbro and granophyre, which\r\nrepresent the deeper parts of the Tertiary volcanic series, while the\r\nbasalts were poured out at the surface. Thus, at Papafjord, the gabbro\r\nrises into mountainous peaks and, like the similar rock in Mull and\r\nSkye, is intersected by dykes of a coarse-grained granitoid liparite or\r\ngranophyre. Large dykes and ramifying veins of the same acid material,\r\noften with a thoroughly granitic aspect, extend into the basalts.[267]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 267: Mr. Thoroddsen, _Dansk. Geografisk Tidsskrift_, vol. xiii.]\r\n\r\nA long series of eruptions has taken place in Iceland since the Glacial\r\nPeriod. There were likewise pre-glacial eruptions. The glaciated\r\nlava-streams are found underneath the modern lavas. So far indeed as is\r\nknown, no evidence exists of any important cessation of subterranean\r\nactivity there since Tertiary time.[268] The existing volcanic phenomena\r\nmay with probability be regarded as the survival of those which were\r\nso widely manifested over the Icelandic area and the north-west\r\nof Europe in the older Tertiary ages. A careful study of them may\r\ntherefore be expected to throw light on the history of the Tertiary\r\nbasaltic plateaux; while, on the other hand, the thorough dissection of\r\nthese plateaux by the denuding agencies will not improbably be found\r\nto explain some parts of the subterranean mechanism of the modern\r\nIcelandic volcanoes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 268: See Dr. Johnston-Lavis, _Scottish Geographical Magazine_,\r\n1895, p. 442.]\r\n\r\nIn calling attention to some of the more obvious analogies which\r\nmay be traced between the modern and the ancient volcanoes, I am\r\nmore particularly indebted to the excellent memoirs of the resident\r\nIcelandic geologist, Mr. Th. Thoroddsen, who has examined so large a\r\npart of the island.[269] The account given by Mr. A. Holland of the Laki\r\ncraters has likewise been of much service to me.[270] Among other recent\r\nobservers I may cite Dr. Tempest Anderson,[271] who has made himself\r\nfamiliar with extensive tracts of Iceland. He was accompanied one year\r\nby Dr. Johnston-Lavis, who has published a narrative of the journey.[272]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 269: See In particular his paper on the volcanoes of north-east\r\nIceland (_Bihang till. k. Svensk. Vet. Akad. Handl._ xiv. ii. No. 5,\r\n1888) and that on Snaefell and Faxebugt in the south-west of the island\r\n(_op. cit._ xvii. ii. No. 2, 1891); also papers in _Dansk. Geografisk\r\nTidsskrift_, vols. xii. xiii. (1893-95); _Verhand. Gesellsch. Erdkunde\r\nzu Berlin_, 1894-95.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 270: \"Lakis Kratere og Lavaströmme, Universitætsprogram,\"\r\nChristiania, 1885. See Mr. Thoroddsen's remarks on this paper,\r\n_Verhand. Gesell. Erdkunde_, 1894, p. 289.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 271: _Brit. Assoc. Rep._ 1894, p. 650.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 272: Dr. Johnston-Lavis, _Scottish Geographical Magazine_,\r\nSeptember 1895.]\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to suppose that the Icelandic volcanoes are generally\r\nbuilt on the plan of such mountains as Vesuvius or Etna. Mr. Thoroddsen\r\ncan evidently hardly repress his impatience to find these two Italian\r\ncones cited in almost every handbook of geology as types of modern\r\nvolcanoes and their operations. The regular volcanic cone, composed\r\nof alternations of lavas and tuffs, plays a very subordinate part in\r\nIceland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 292.--Fissure (gjá) in a lava-field, Iceland. (From\r\na photograph by Dr. Tempest Anderson.)]\r\n\r\nThe fundamental feature in the Icelandic eruptions is the production\r\nof fissures which reach the surface and discharge streams of lava\r\nfrom many points. Two systems of such fissures appear to be specially\r\nmarked, one in southern Iceland running from south-west to north-east,\r\nthe other, in the north part of the island, stretching from south\r\nto north.[273] Hekla and Laki belong to the former. The dislocations\r\nhave often followed the boundaries of the \"horsts,\" or solid blocks\r\nof country which have withstood terrestrial displacement. The vast\r\noutbreaks of Odádahraun and Myvatn have almost all issued from fissures\r\nof that nature.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 273: In the Snaefell promontory they run nearly east and west.\r\nMr. Thoroddsen, _Bihang. Svensk. Akad._ xvii. (ii.) No. 2, p. 91.]\r\n\r\nThe violent eruption of 1875 in Askja found its exit at the\r\nintersection of two lines of fissures. Many large fissures were opened\r\non the surface in a nearly north and south direction, which could be\r\nfollowed for 80 kilometres or nearly 50 English miles. Some of them\r\nbecame the theatre of intense volcanic activity.[274]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 274: Mr. Thoroddsen, _op. cit._ xiv. ii. No. 5, p. 63.]\r\n\r\nMany lines of fissure are traceable at the surface as clefts or \"gjás,\"\r\nthat run nearly straight for long distances, with a width of one to\r\nthree yards, and sometimes of unknown depth.[275] The most stupendous\r\nexample of the structure yet discovered is probably the Eldgjá found by\r\nDr. Thoroddsen in the year 1893, below the Mýrdalsjökull. This gigantic\r\nchasm has a length of 30 kilometres (more than 18 English miles), and\r\na depth of 130 to 200 metres (426 to 656 feet). Over its vertical walls\r\nlofty waterfalls plunge from the crest to the bottom.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275: On the various modes of origin of these chasms, see Dr.\r\nTempest Anderson, _Brit. Assoc. Rep._ p. 650. The gjá shown in Fig. 292\r\nis not an eruptive fissure. For this and the following illustration\r\nI am indebted to the kindness of Dr. Tempest Anderson, who himself\r\nphotographed the scenes.]\r\n\r\nOccasionally a fissure has not been continuously opened to the surface.\r\nAn interesting example of such intermittent chasms is supplied by the\r\ngreat rent which gave forth the enormous volume of lava in 1783. The\r\nmountain of Laki, composed of palagonite tuff, stands on the line of\r\nthis dislocation, but has not been entirely ruptured. The fissure has\r\nclosed up beneath the mountain, a short distance above the bottom of\r\nthe slope, as is shown by the position of a couple of small craters.[276]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 276: Mr. A. Helland, _op. cit._ p. 25.]\r\n\r\nSome fissures have remained mere open chasms without any discharge of\r\nvolcanic material; others have served as passages for the escape of\r\nlava and the ejection of loose slags and cinders.[277]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 277: Mr. Thoroddsen has observed that in the Reykjanes\r\npeninsula in the south-west of Iceland, by the subsidence of one side\r\nof a fissure, a row of four craters has been cut through, leaving their\r\nsegments perched upon the upper side. _Globus._ vol. lxix. No. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 293.--Cones on the great Laki fissure, Iceland.\r\n(From a photograph by Dr. Tempest Anderson.)]\r\n\r\nIn some instances, according to Mr. Thoroddsen, lava wells out from\r\nthe whole length of a fissure without giving rise to the formation of\r\ncones, the molten material issuing either from one or from both sides\r\nand flowing out tranquilly. Thus from three points on the great Eldgjá\r\nchasm lava spread out quietly without giving rise to any craters,\r\nthough at the southern prolongation of the fissure, where it becomes\r\nnarrower, a row of low slag-cones was formed. The three lava-streams\r\nflooded the low ground over an area of 693 square kilometres, or 270\r\nEnglish square miles. In the great majority of cases, however, the\r\nlava as it ascends in the fissure gives rise to long ramparts of slags\r\nand blocks of lava piled up on either side, or to a row of cones along\r\nthe line of the open chasm. Thus, on the Laki fissure, which runs for\r\nabout 20 miles in a north-east direction, the cones amount to some\r\nhundreds in number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 293_a_.--Plan of small craters along the line of\r\ngreat Laki fissure, Iceland. (After Mr. Helland, reduced.)]\r\n\r\nThe cones consist generally of slags, cinders, and blocks of lava.\r\nThey are on the whole not quite circular but oblong, their major axis\r\ncoinciding with the line of the chasm on which they have been piled up,\r\nas along the marvellous line of the Laki fissure. In many places they\r\nare exceedingly irregular in form, changes in the direction of outflow\r\nof lava or of escape of steam having caused the cones partially to\r\nefface each other.\r\n\r\nAs regards their size, the cones present a wide range. Some of them\r\nare only a few yards in diameter, others several hundred yards.\r\nGenerally they are comparatively low mounds. On a fissure hardly 30\r\nfeet long, Mr. Thoroddsen found a row of twelve small cones built\r\nexactly like those of largest size, but with craters less than three\r\nfeet in diameter. On the Laki fissure some are only a couple of yards\r\nhigh; the majority are much less than 50 yards in height, and hardly\r\none is as much as 100 yards.[278] And yet these little monticules, as\r\nMr. Helland remarks, represent the pipes from which milliards of\r\ncubic metres of lava have issued. While other European volcanoes form\r\nconspicuous features in the landscape, the Icelandic volcanoes of the\r\nLaki district, from which the vastest floods of lava have issued in\r\nmodern times, are so low that they might escape notice unless they were\r\nactually sought for.[279]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 278: Mr. Thoroddsen, however, states that there are about 100\r\nranging between 20 and 100 metres in height.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 279: _Op. cit._ p. 27.]\r\n\r\nAs they have generally arisen along lines of fissure, the cones are,\r\nfor the most part, grouped in rows. The hundreds of cones that mark the\r\nline of the Laki fissure present an extraordinary picture of volcanic\r\nenergy of this type. In other instances the cones occur in groups,\r\nthough this distribution may have arisen from the irregular uprise\r\nof scattered vents along a series of parallel fissures. Thus to the\r\nnorth-east of Laki a series of old cones entirely surrounded by the\r\nlavas of 1783 lie in groups, the most northerly of which consists of\r\nabout 100 exceedingly small craters that have sent out streams of lava\r\ntowards the N.N.E.[280]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 280: _Op. cit._ p. 25. The great lava-fields of Iceland are\r\nlikewise dotted over with secondary craters or \"hornitos\" which have\r\nno direct connection with the magma below, but arise from local causes\r\naffecting the outflowing lava. They are grouped in hundreds over a\r\nsmall space.]\r\n\r\nIt would appear from Mr. Helland's observations that the same fissure\r\nhas sometimes been made use of at more than one period of eruption. He\r\ndescribes some old craters on the line of the Laki fissure, which had\r\nbeen active long before the outbreak of 1783.[281]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 281: _Op. cit._ p. 26.]\r\n\r\nWhen the lava issues from fissures it is in such a condition of\r\nplasticity that it can be drawn out into threads and spun into\r\nropes. When the slope over which it flows is steep it often splits\r\nup into blocks on the surface. Where the ground is flat the lava\r\nspreads out uniformly on all sides, forming wide plains as level as\r\na floor. Thus the vast lava-desert of Odádahraun covers a plain 3640\r\nsquare kilometres in area, or, if the small-lava-streams north from\r\nVatnajökull be included, 4390 square kilometres. This vast flood of\r\nlava (about 1700 English square miles in extent) would, according to\r\nMr. Thoroddsen, cover Denmark to a depth of 16 feet. The whole of this\r\nenormous discharge has been given forth from more than twenty vents\r\nsituated for the most part on parallel fissures.\r\n\r\nNot less striking is the picture of fissure-eruption to be met with at\r\nLaki--the scene of the great lava-floods of 1783. \"Conceive now,\" says\r\nMr. Helland, \"these hundreds of craters, or, as they are called by the\r\nIcelanders, 'borge,' lying one behind another in a long row; every one\r\nof them having sent out two or more streams of lava, now to the one\r\nside, now to the other. Understand further that these streams merge\r\ninto each other, so as to flow wholly round the cones and form fields\r\nof lava miles in width, which, like vast frozen floods, flow down to\r\nthe country districts, and you may form some idea of this remarkable\r\nregion.\"[282]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 282: _Op. cit._ p. 24. Mr. Helland allows an average thickness\r\nof 30 metres for the mass of lava which issued in two streams, one\r\n80 kilometres (nearly 50 miles), the other 45 kilometres (about 28\r\nmiles) long. He estimates the total volume of lava discharged in\r\nthe 1783 eruption at 27 milliards of cubic metres, equal to a block\r\n10 kilometres (6 miles 376 yards) long, 5 kilometres (3 miles 188\r\nyards) broad, and 540 metres (1771 feet) high; _op. cit._ p. 31. Mr.\r\nThoroddsen remarks that the older estimates of the volume of lava\r\ndischarged by this eruption have been greatly exaggerated. He puts\r\nthe area covered by lava at 565 square kilometres and the contents at\r\n12-1/3 cubic kilometres. Verhand. _Gesell. Erdkunde Berlin_, 1894, p.\r\n296.]\r\n\r\nThe basaltic lavas have issued in a comparatively liquid state, form\r\nthin sheets and reach to great distances. The western stream from the\r\nLaki eruption of 1783 flowed for upwards of 40 miles; a prehistoric\r\nlava from Trölladyngjá in Odádahraun flowed for more than 60 miles.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time the successive streams of lava poured out upon\r\none of these wide volcanic plains gradually increase the height of\r\nthe ground, while preserving its generally level aspect. The loose\r\nslag-cones of earlier eruptions are effaced or swallowed up, as one\r\nlava-stream follows another. Eventually, when, by the operation of\r\nrunning water or by fissure and subsidence, transverse sections are\r\ncut through these lava-sheets, the observer can generally notice only\r\nhorizontal beds of lava piled one above another, including the dykes\r\nconnected with them and intercalated masses of loose slag, that remain\r\nas relics of the old craters.\r\n\r\nIn some places the lava has gradually built up enormous domes, like\r\nthose of Hawaii, having a gentle inclination in every direction, as may\r\nbe seen especially in the district between Floderne Skjalfanafljot and\r\nJökulsà Most of the large volcanic piles of North Iceland are of this\r\nnature. The highest of them are 1209 and 1491 metres high by from 6\r\nto 15 kilometres in diameter. The elliptical crater of the highest of\r\nthese eminences measures 1100 by 380 metres.[283]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 283: Mr. Thoroddsen, _op. cit._ xiv. ii. No. 5, pp. 10, 23.]\r\n\r\nLarge conical volcanoes of the Vesuvian type built up of alternating\r\nlavas and tuffs are not common in Iceland, but some occur and rise\r\ninto lofty glacier-covered mountains, such as Öræfajökull (6241 feet),\r\nEyjafjallajökull (5432), and Snaefellsjökull (4577). Hekla (4961) also\r\nis similarly composed of sheets of lava and tuffs, but has not been\r\nbuilt as a cone. It forms an oblong ridge which has been fissured\r\nin the direction of its length and bears a row of craters along the\r\nfissure.[284]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 284: Mr. Thoroddsen, _Dansk. Geograf. Tidsskrift_, vol. xiii.]\r\n\r\nExplosion-craters likewise occur among the modern volcanic phenomena\r\nof Iceland. One of these was formed by a violent explosion at Askja\r\non 29th March 1875. It has a diameter of only about 280 feet, yet so\r\ngreat was the vigour of the outburst that pumiceous stones were spread\r\nover an area of more than 100 Danish (468 English) square miles, and\r\nthe dust was carried as far as Norway and Sweden. Nine years later Mr.\r\nThoroddsen found the bottom of this crater filled with bluish-green\r\nboiling mud, which will probably in the end become a sheet of still\r\nwater. The borders of these Icelandic explosion-craters seem to be very\r\nlittle higher than the ground around them. Most of the ejected material\r\nis expelled with such force and to such a distance that only a small\r\nfraction of it falls down around the orifice of eruption.[285]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 285: Mr. Thoroddsen, _op. cit._]\r\n\r\nThere is still another feature of the Icelandic volcanic regions which\r\nmay be cited as an interesting parallel to the sequence of eruptive\r\ndischarges among the Inner Hebrides. While the lavas are as a rule\r\nmore or less basic--many of them being true basalts--they have been\r\nat different times pierced by much more acid liparites and obsidians.\r\nExamples of these rocks of post-Glacial age have recently been traced\r\non the ground by Mr. Thoroddsen,[286] and their petrographical characters\r\nhave been studied by Mr. Bäckström.[287] The wide distribution of such\r\nrocks all over the island, their occurrence in isolated bosses among\r\nthe more basic lavas, and their remarkable internal structures have\r\nbeen noted by several observers.[288] The liparites and obsidians are\r\ncontrasted with the basalt by the colours and forms of their streams.\r\nSome of them are so black as to look like heaps of coal, though their\r\nsurfaces pass into grey pumice. They have flowed out in a much less\r\nliquid condition than the basalts, and have consequently formed short,\r\nthick and irregular sheets. The liparites and basalts appear to have\r\nbeen nearly contemporaneous. They certainly belong to the same volcanic\r\ncycle and their vents lie close to each other. Though none of the\r\nacid eruptions are known to have occurred in modern times, some of the\r\nliparites are crusted with sulphur and from the connected fissures\r\nsteam still rises.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 286: _Geol. Fören. Stockholm Förhandl._ xiii. (1891), p. 609;\r\n_Bihang. Svensk. Vet. Akad. Handl._ xvii. ii. p. 21 (1891); _Dansk.\r\nGeograf. Tidsskrift_, xiii. (1895).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 287: _Geol. Fören. Stockholm Förhandl._ xiii. (1891), p. 637.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 288: See in particular C. W. Schmidt, _Zeitsch. Deutsch. Geol.\r\nGesellsch._ xxxvii. (1885), p. 737.]\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen how entirely the modern volcanic eruptions\r\nof Iceland agree with the phenomena presented by our Tertiary\r\nbasalt-plateaux. It is, therefore, to the Icelandic type of\r\nfissure-eruptions, and not to great central composite cones like\r\nVesuvius or Etna that we must look for the modern analogies that will\r\nbest serve as commentary and explanation for the latest chapter in the\r\nlong volcanic history of the British Isles.[289]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 289: In his memoir of 1874, Professor Judd announced his\r\nconclusion that there were formerly five great volcanoes amongst\r\nthe Western Isles, and that the lavas of the plateaux had issued\r\nfrom these. He subsequently reiterated this view (_Quart. Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc._ xlv., 1890, p. 187), and ridiculed the explanation of\r\nfissure-eruptions. The evidence adduced by me in a paper published in\r\n1896 (same journal, vol. lii. p. 331) and reprinted with additions\r\nin this chapter, will, I trust, be regarded by geologists as having\r\nfinally settled this question.]\r\n\r\nAs a further but more ancient illustration of the type of volcanic\r\naction which appears to have been prevalent during the formation of the\r\nTertiary volcanic plateaux of Britain, I may again refer to the vast\r\nbasalt-fields of Western America. The basalt of Idaho stretches out as\r\nan apparently limitless plain. Along its northern boundary, this sea\r\nof black lava runs up the valleys and round the promontories of the\r\nolder trachytic hills with almost the flatness of a sheet of water.\r\nIt has been deeply trenched, however, by the streams that wind across\r\nit, and especially by the Snake River, which has cut out a gorge some\r\n700 feet deep, on the walls of which the successive beds of basalt lie\r\nhorizontally one upon another, winding along the curving face of the\r\nprecipice exactly as those of Antrim and the Inner Hebrides do along\r\ntheir sea-worn escarpments. Here and there, a low cinder-cone on the\r\nsurface of the plain marks the site of a late outflow. One is struck,\r\nhowever, with the singular absence of tuffs and volcanic conglomerates.\r\nThe basalts appear to have flowed out stream after stream with few\r\nfragmentary discharges.\r\n\r\nThese characteristic features of one distinctive type of volcanic\r\naction have been repeated over a vast region, or rather a whole series\r\nof regions, in Western America, the united area of which must equal\r\nthat of a considerable part of Europe. From Idaho, the basalt-fields\r\nmay be followed southwards interruptedly into Utah and Nevada, and\r\nacross the great plateau-country of the cañons into Arizona and New\r\nMexico, northwards into Montana, and westwards into Oregon. The tract\r\nwhich has as yet been most carefully traversed and described is\r\nprobably that of the high plateaux of Utah and Arizona. Thus on the\r\nUinkaret plateau, which measures some 45 to 50 miles in length by 8 to\r\n12 in breadth, a thick covering of basalt has been spread composed of\r\nmany successive flows. Between 160 and 170 separate cones have been\r\ncounted on this area, most of them quite small, mere low mounds of\r\nscoriæ, though a few reach a height of 700 or 800 feet, with a diameter\r\nof a mile. From three to seven or eight may be found in a row, as if\r\nspringing from a single line of fissure. But generally the grouping\r\nis quite irregular.[290] My friend Captain C. E. Dutton, from whose\r\nadmirable memoir these details are quoted, remarks further that among\r\nthe Utah plateaux no trace of a cone is to be found at or near some of\r\nthe most recent basalt-fields, and that the most extensive outpours are\r\nmost frequently without cones. \"The lavas,\" he adds, \"appear to have\r\nreached the surface and overflowed like water from a spring, spreading\r\nout immediately and deluging a broad surface around the orifice.\"[291]\r\nThe deep gorges cut by the rivers through these thick accumulations of\r\nhorizontal or nearly horizontal basalts, have here and there revealed\r\nparallel dykes that traverse the rocks, and in at least one case\r\nhave shown the dyke running for half a mile up a cliff and actually\r\ncommunicating with a crater of scoriæ at the top.[292] Again, in New\r\nMexico, Captain Dutton noticed vast tracts of younger basalt, about\r\nwhich \"a striking fact is the entire absence of all distinguishable\r\ntraces of the vents from which they came. Some of them, however,\r\nindicate unmistakably their sources in small depressed cones of very\r\nflat profiles. No fragmental ejecta (scoriæ, lapilli, etc.) have been\r\nfound in connection with these young eruptions.\"[293] Such I believe\r\nto have been the general conditions under which the basalts of the\r\nTertiary plateaux of the British Isles were also erupted.[294]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 290: Captain C. E. Dutton, \"Tertiary History of the Grand Cañon\r\nDistrict,\" _U.S. Geol. Survey_ (1882), p. 104.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 291: Captain C. E. Dutton, \"Geology of the High Plateaux\r\nof Utah,\" _U.S. Geol. Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region_ (1880),\r\npp. 198, 200. See also pp. 232, 234, 276 of the same Monograph for\r\nadditional examples.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 292: _Tertiary History of the Grand Cañon_, etc., p. 95.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 293: _Nature_, xxxi. (1884), p. 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 294: I may again refer to Hopkins's _Researches in Physical\r\nGeology_, where the conditions of the problem here discussed have\r\nbeen distinctly realized. Speaking of the ejection of lava from a\r\nnumber of fissures, he remarks that the imperfect fluidity of the\r\nmelted material \"would seem to require a number of points or lines\r\nof ejection as a necessary condition.\" \"If there were only a single\r\ncentre of eruption, a bed of such matter approximating to uniformity\r\nof thickness, could only be produced on a surface of a conical form.\"\r\n\"Where no such tendency to this conical structure can be traced, it\r\nwould probably be in vain to look for any single centre of eruption.\r\nOn the supposition, too, of ejection through continued fissures, or\r\nfrom a number of points, that minor unevenness of surface which must\r\nprobably have existed under all circumstances during the formation of\r\nthe earth's crust, would not necessarily destroy the continuity of a\r\ncomparatively thin extensive bed of the ejected matter, in the same\r\ndegree in which it would inevitably produce that effect in the case of\r\ncentral ejection\" (_Cambridge Phil. Trans._ vi. 1835, p. 71).]\r\n\r\nAlthough we may be convinced, from their general structure and\r\nrelations, that the stratified lavas of these plateaux have been poured\r\nout from fissures and not from great central cones, it must obviously\r\nbe difficult to obtain demonstrative evidence of this origin from any\r\nsingle section. Of the thousands of dykes which traverse the British\r\nplateaux and the ground around them, I am not aware of a single one\r\nwhich can be actually seen to have ever communicated with the surface.\r\nThe very process of denudation which has revealed these dykes has at\r\nthe same time removed all trace of any former connection they may have\r\nhad with the surface. The only places where we may hopefully search\r\nfor the missing evidence are the fronts of the escarpments. On these\r\nprecipices dykes may sometimes be seen to end off at some particular\r\nplatform among the basalt-sheets, but I have never found a case which\r\ncould be confidently cited as an example of lava rising in a fissure\r\nand spreading out as a superficial sheet. That this connection may\r\neventually be found when a more detailed survey is made of these great\r\nsea-walls I fully anticipate.\r\n\r\nIn recently mapping the basalt-plateau of Strathaird in Skye, Mr.\r\nHarker has made some interesting observations regarding the probable\r\nconnection of the dykes with the plateau basalts. He has noticed that\r\nthe flanks of Slat Bheinn, a portion of the plateau, are abundantly\r\ntraversed by dykes containing numerous enclosed pieces of gabbro,\r\nwhile the basalt on the summit of the plateau is full of similar\r\nfragments--an occurrence not observed elsewhere. It is conceivable that\r\nthe gabbro-bearing basalt-sheets are sills, but Mr. Harker has found no\r\nproof that they are so, the evidence so far as it has been collected\r\nbeing rather in favour of the view that these sheets are superficial\r\nlavas, and that they have been supplied from the dyke-fissures.\r\n\r\nVarious considerations suffice to assure us that actual instances of\r\nthe outflow of the basalt from its parent fissures should be expected\r\nto be exceptional. The absence or scarcity of beds of scoriæ among the\r\nbasalt-plateaux may be taken as an indication that the lava as a rule\r\nflowed out without the formation of cinder-cones, and therefore that\r\nthese conspicuous monuments of the eruptive vents were probably always\r\nrare in Britain. If the lava was poured out tranquilly from one or two\r\npoints along a fissure which were subsequently buried under floods of\r\nsimilar lava issuing from other fissures, the chances that such points\r\nof emission should be laid open along the front of any escarpment are\r\nsmall. And, even when so exposed, it might be difficult to feel sure\r\nthat the dyke below was really the feeder of the basalt above, unless\r\nthe cliff were accessible and the rocks could be scrutinized foot by\r\nfoot. These elements of uncertainty are happily removed where the\r\nvolcanic energy has drilled well-marked funnels of discharge and left\r\nthem filled with the erupted materials, as will be narrated in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n               THE ERUPTIVE VENTS OF THE BASALT-PLATEAUX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Vents filled with Basalt or other Lava-form Rock--Vents filled\r\n  with Agglomerate\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most interesting points in the Tertiary volcanic\r\nhistory that, in spite of the enormous geological revolutions that\r\nhave passed since they became extinct, the sites of many scattered\r\nvents can still be recognized. A far greater number must lie buried\r\nunder the basalts, and of others the positions are concealed by\r\nthe sea, which now covers so large an area of the old lava-fields.\r\nNevertheless, partly within the area of the plateaux, but still more\r\non the surrounding tracts from which the basalts have been removed\r\nby denudation, the traces of unmistakable vents of discharge may be\r\nrecognized amid the general wreck.\r\n\r\nIn Britain and the Faroe Isles, it is chiefly along the coast-line\r\nthat the process of denudation has revealed the volcanic vents of\r\nTertiary time. The interior of the country is often loaded with peat,\r\ncovered with herbage, or strewn with glacial detritus: and even where\r\nindications of the vents are to be detected, it is not always possible\r\nto ascertain their true limits and connections. But where the structure\r\nof the plateaux has been laid bare along ranges of rocky precipice, the\r\nvents have sometimes been so admirably dissected by the sea that every\r\nfeature of their arrangements can be satisfactorily determined.\r\n\r\nAs the actual physical connexion of these volcanic orifices with the\r\nplateaux has been in most cases removed by denudation, we can usually\r\nonly by inference place them in what was probably their true relation\r\nto the plateau-eruptions. Those which project from the surface of the\r\nplateaux must, of course, be younger than the basalts through which\r\nthey rise; how much younger we cannot tell. They may possibly be later\r\nthan any of the plateau-sheets; they may even belong to a subsequent\r\nand waning condition of volcanic action. On the other hand, the vents\r\nwhich can now be traced outside of the present limits of the edges\r\nof the plateaux may, like those just mentioned, be younger than the\r\nbasalt-sheets, or, on the contrary, they may be records of a period\r\nof eruptivity anterior to the emission of any of the rocks of the\r\nplateaux, and may have been deeply buried under a mass of basalt-beds\r\nsubsequently removed. Positive demonstration is, from the nature of\r\nthe case, impossible in these instances. But examples will be cited\r\nfrom the Western Isles and from Faroe, where the vents can be proved\r\nto belong to the time of the plateau-eruptions, for they are seen to\r\nhave broken through some of the basalt-sheets and to have been buried\r\nunder others. With this clear evidence of relationship in some cases,\r\nthere need be little hesitation in believing that in other instances\r\nwhere no such positive connexion can be found, but where the vents are\r\nobviously such as the general structure of the plateaux would have led\r\nus to expect, they may be confidently regarded as part of the phenomena\r\nof the plateau-eruptions.\r\n\r\nSometimes the vents can be linked with lines of fissures or dykes. This\r\nis especially the case where they are small in size. More usually,\r\nhowever, no such relation can be demonstrated. It will be remembered\r\nthat among the modern Icelandic eruptions, some eruptive vents, like\r\nthe later cinder-cones of Laki, are ranged in a linear direction\r\nalong the great fissure, while others, of an older series in the same\r\ndistrict, almost engulphed amidst the more recent lavas, are clustered\r\nirregularly in groups. A similar diversity of arrangement has been\r\nobserved among the volcanic cones of the Velay in Central France.\r\n\r\nConsidering as a whole the volcanic necks or eruptive vents which rise\r\nfrom the older rocks around the Tertiary basalt-plateaux, and sometimes\r\neven from the surface of these plateaux themselves, we may conveniently\r\nfollow the same classification as was adopted in dealing with those\r\nof Palæozoic age, and, according to the nature of the material that\r\nnow fills them, arrange them in two series: (1) Those occupied by some\r\nform of crystalline eruptive rock, and (2) those filled with volcanic\r\nagglomerate.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. VENTS FILLED WITH DOLERITE, BASALT, ETC.\r\n\r\nThese, as the composition of the plateaux would lead us to anticipate,\r\nare numerous. They perhaps attain their most conspicuous development\r\nin Antrim, either on the tableland or among the underlying rocks\r\nround its edges. The finest example in that district is undoubtedly\r\nfurnished by the lofty eminence called Slemish, which rises above the\r\nsurrounding basalt-terrace, to a height of 1437 feet above the sea\r\n(Fig. 294). It is elliptical in ground-plan, measuring some 4000 feet\r\nin length by 1000 in breadth. Seen from the north, it appears as a\r\nnearly perfect cone. The material of which it consists is a coarsely\r\ncrystalline olivine-dolerite, presenting under the microscope a nearly\r\nholocrystalline aggregate, in which the lath-shaped felspars penetrate\r\nthe augite, with abundant fresh olivine, and wedge-shaped patches\r\nof interstitial matter. The rock is massive and amorphous, except\r\nthat it is divided by parallel joints into large quadrangular blocks\r\nlike a granitic rock, and wholly different from the character of the\r\nsurrounding basalts. The latter, which possess the ordinary characters\r\nof the rocks of the plateaux, can be followed to within 80 yards of\r\nthis neck, which rises steeply from them, but their actual junction\r\nwith it is concealed under the depth of talus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 294.--Slemish, a Volcanic Neck or Vent on the\r\nAntrim Plateau, seen from the north.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 295.--Section of Volcanic Vent at Carnmony Hill (E.\r\nHull).\r\n\r\nT, Lower basalt; C, Cretaceous strata; L, Lower Lias; M, Triassic\r\nmarls; V, Vent.]\r\n\r\nAt the nearest point to which the two rocks are traceable, the basalts\r\nappear somewhat indurated, break with a peculiar splintery fracture,\r\nand weather with a white crust. These characters are still better shown\r\non abundant fragments which may be picked up among the debris further\r\nup the slope. There can be no doubt, I think, that a ring of flinty\r\nbasalt, differing considerably in texture from the usual aspect of that\r\nrock in the district, surrounds the neck. The meaning of this ring\r\nwill be more clearly seen from the description of another example in\r\nMull. About four miles to the north-east of Slemish, a smaller and less\r\nconspicuous neck rises out of the plateau-basalts. The rock of which\r\nit consists is less coarsely crystalline than that of Slemish, but its\r\nrelations to the surrounding volcanic rocks are obviously the same. On\r\nthe west side of Belfast Lough a boss of similar rock, about 1200 feet\r\nin diameter, rises at the very edge of the basalt escarpment into the\r\neminence known as Carnmony Hill (Fig. 295). On its northern side it\r\npresents along its wall a mass of interposed volcanic agglomerate.[295]\r\nOn visiting with Mr. M'Henry the quarry opened on the eastern face of\r\nthis vent, I was much struck with the remarkable cellular structure\r\nof some parts of the dolerite. Many of the vesicles are lined with a\r\nthin pellicle of black glass, and the same substance occurs in minute\r\npatches in the body of the rock. A thin slice exhibiting this structure\r\nwas found by Mr. Watts to possess the following characters:--\"The\r\nrock is an ophitic dolerite consisting of plagioclase, augite, and\r\niron ores, without olivine, enclosing one or two patches of finer\r\nbasalt. The vesicles in the latter, and certain angular spaces between\r\nthe crystals of the former, have been wholly or partially filled with\r\nbrown glass, the outer part of which has been converted into radiating\r\ncrystals of a brown mineral.\" The occurrence of patches of glass which\r\nseem to have been squeezed into vesicles or cracks in the body of a\r\ndolerite or andesite has been noticed in some of the Tertiary dykes.\r\nBut in the present case the glass occurs as a mere coating on the walls\r\nof the larger spheroidal vesicles, the interior of which generally\r\nremains empty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 295: This neck was recognised by Du Noyer in 1868 as \"one of\r\nthe great pipes or feeders of the basaltic flows.\" See Prof. Hull,\r\nExplanation of Sheets 21, 28 and 29, _Geol. Survey of Ireland_ (1876),\r\np. 30.]\r\n\r\nOf the other doleritic necks scattered over the surface of the Antrim\r\nplateau, I will refer to only one which occurs on the hillslopes\r\nbetween Glenarm and Larne. It forms a prominence known as the Scawt\r\nHill, and consists of a boss of basalt, which, in rising through a vent\r\nin the plateau-sheets, has carried up with it and converted into marble\r\na large mass of chalk which is now exposed along its eastern wall (Fig.\r\n296).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 296.--Section of the east side of Scawt Hill, near\r\nGlenarm.\r\n\r\n_a_, bedded basalt; _b_, mass of chalk; _c_, basalt neck.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 297.--Section of Neck of Basalt, Bendoo, Ballintoy.\r\n\r\n_a_ _a_, Chalk; _b_, neck.]\r\n\r\nAs examples of similar necks which have been exposed by denudation\r\noutside the present limits of the same plateau, I may allude to those\r\nwhich rise through the Cretaceous and other Secondary strata on the\r\nnorthern coast near Ballintoy. One of the most striking of these may\r\nbe seen at Bendoo, where a plug of basalt, measuring about 1400 feet\r\nin one diameter and 800 feet in another, rises through the Chalk, and\r\nalters it around the line of contact (Fig. 297). Another remarkably\r\npicturesque example is to be seen near Cushendall, where a prominent\r\ndoleritic cone rises out of the platform of Old Red Sandstone, some\r\ndistance to the north of the present edge of the volcanic escarpment\r\n(Fig. 298).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 298.--Volcanic Neck of Dolerite near Cushendall.]\r\n\r\nThe greater coarseness of grain of the material filling these pipes,\r\ncompared with that of the sheets in the terraces, is only what the very\r\ndifferent conditions of cooling and consolidation would lead us to\r\nexpect. There is no essential difference of composition between the two\r\nrocks. Where the erupted material has been poured out at the surface,\r\nit has assumed a finely crystalline texture, while, where it has slowly\r\nsolidified within a volcanic pipe at some depth beneath the surface,\r\nand where consequently its component crystals have had more time for\r\ndevelopment, the resulting structure is much more largely crystalline,\r\nwith a more or less complete development of the ophitic structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 299.--Section of Volcanic Neck at 'S Airde Beinne,\r\nnear Tobermory, Mull.\r\n\r\n_a_ _a_, bedded basalts; _b_ _b_, bedded basalts altered along the side\r\nof vent; _c_ _c_, dolerite.]\r\n\r\nIn the island of Mull, another instance of the same kind of vent has\r\nbeen observed and described by Professor Judd.[296] It rises in the\r\nconspicuous hill, 'S Airde Beinne (Sarta Beinn), about two miles\r\nsouth-west from Tobermory, and consists of a coarsely crystalline\r\ndolerite, which becomes finer in grain towards the outer margin\r\n(Fig. 299). No bedding, or structure of any kind beyond jointing, is\r\nperceptible in it. Examined in thin sections under the microscope,\r\nthis rock is found to be another typical ophitic dolerite, consisting\r\nof lath-shaped felspars embedded in augite, with here and there\r\nwedge-shaped portions of interstitial matter and grains of olivine. Dr.\r\nHatch found the felspars to contain spherical inclusions of devitrified\r\nglass, filled with black granules and trichites, and he observed that,\r\nunder a high power, the interstitial matter is seen to consist mainly\r\nof a greenish-brown isotropic substance, in which are inclosed small\r\ncrystals of augite, skeleton-forms and microlites of felspar, sometimes\r\nin stellate aggregates, as well as club-shaped, cruciform, arrow-headed\r\nand often crested microlites of magnetite.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 296: _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._, xxx. (1874), p. 264.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 300.--Interior of the Volcanic Neck of 'S Airde\r\nBeinne, near Tobermory, Mull.]\r\n\r\nTowering prominently above the flat basalt sheets, this neck has an\r\noval form, measuring about half a mile in length by a quarter of a\r\nmile in breadth. Its central portion, however, instead of rising into\r\na rugged hill-top, as is usually the case, sinks into a deep hollow,\r\nwhich is filled with water, and reminds one of a true crater-lake\r\n(Figs. 299, 300). The middle of the neck is thus concealed from view,\r\nand we can only examine the hard prominent ring of dolerite that\r\nsurrounds the tarn. The material occupying the hollow may be softer\r\nthan that of the ring, and may have been scooped out by denudation.\r\nWhat we now see may not be the original surface, but may have been\r\nexposed after the removal of possibly hundreds of feet of overlying\r\nmaterial. On the other hand, it is conceivable that the hollow is\r\nreally a crater-lake which was filled up with detritus and may have\r\nbeen overspread with basalt, since removed. It may be suggestively\r\ncompared with the crater-hollows revealed by denudation on the cliffs\r\nof Stromö and Portree Harbour, which will be described in a later part\r\nof this chapter. Possibly some more easily removable agglomerate,\r\nrepresenting an eruption later than that of the dolerite, may occupy\r\nthe centre of the volcanic pipe.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting features of this vent is to be found in\r\nits relation to the surrounding basalts. The marginal parts of the\r\nrock along the line of contact are much finer in grain than the rest,\r\nand have obviously cooled more rapidly. The contrast between them and\r\nthe ordinary dolerite nearer the centre, however, cannot be properly\r\nunderstood, except in thin sections under the microscope. Dr. Hatch, to\r\nwhom I submitted my specimens, observed that, in place of the structure\r\nabove described, the marginal parts show an absence of the ophitic\r\ngrouping except in small isolated patches. Instead of occurring in\r\nlarge grains or plates enveloping the felspars, the augite is found in\r\nnumerous small roundish grains, together with grains of magnetite, in\r\nequal abundance and of similar size. The felspars are speckled over\r\nwith opaque particles; olivine has not been detected.\r\n\r\nFor miles around the vent, the plateau-rocks are of the usual\r\ntype--black, compact, sometimes amygdaloidal, alternating with more\r\ncoarsely crystalline decomposing bands, the separation between\r\ndifferent sheets being often marked by the ordinary red ferruginous\r\npartings. But around the margin of the neck, they have undergone a\r\nremarkable metamorphism. The portions of them which adhere to the outer\r\nwall of the neck have lost their distinct bedding, and have been, as\r\nit were, welded together into an indurated compact, black to dull-grey\r\nrock, so shattery and jointed that fresh hand-specimens, three or four\r\ninches in length, are not easily obtainable. Especially marked is one\r\nset of joints which, running approximately parallel, cause the rock to\r\nsplit into plates or slabs. These joints are sometimes curved. Yet, in\r\nspite of the alteration from its normal character, the basalt retains\r\nin places some of its more usual external features, such, for instance,\r\nas its amygdaloidal structure, the amygdales consisting of calcite,\r\nfinely acicular mesotype, and other minerals.\r\n\r\nExamined under the microscope, this altered basalt presents \"a confused\r\naggregate of colourless microlites (felspar?) and innumerable minute\r\ngranules of magnetite, these two constituents being very unequally\r\ndistributed. Sometimes the colourless portions preponderate, in other\r\nplaces the opaque granules are heaped together in black patches, which\r\nmay possibly mark the position of fused augites.\"[297]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 297: Notes by Dr. Hatch.]\r\n\r\nIn the zone of contact-metamorphism around some of the volcanic pipes\r\nin the plateaux, we see changes analogous to, but less developed than,\r\nthose which have been superinduced on so large a scale round the great\r\neruptive bosses of gabbro, granophyre, etc., that have broken up the\r\nterraced basalts along the west coast of Scotland. I shall accordingly\r\nreturn to this subject in connection with phenomena presented by these\r\nyounger rocks (p. 386).\r\n\r\n\r\nii. VENTS FILLED WITH AGGLOMERATE\r\n\r\nWhile the necks of dolerite or basalt cannot always be satisfactorily\r\ndiscriminated from bosses which may never have established a connection\r\nwith the surface, there is no room for any doubt in this respect in\r\nthe case of those filled with fragmentary materials. As has been\r\nalready pointed out, the occurrence of true volcanic agglomerate\r\nmay be accepted as evidence of the existence of an eruptive vent\r\ncommunicating with the surface of the earth. The agglomerate in the\r\nvents associated with the basalt-plateaux, like that of the Palæozoic\r\nvents, is generally exceedingly coarse, and without any trace of\r\nstructure. Blocks of all sizes up to masses some yards in length, and\r\nof the most diversified materials, both volcanic and non-volcanic, are\r\ndispersed confusedly through a granular paste of similar miscellaneous\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 301.--Diagram to show the probable relation of the\r\nNeck at Carrick-a-raide, Antrim, to an adjacent group of tuffs.\r\n\r\n_a_ _a_, Chalk; _b_ _b_, lower group of bedded basalts; _c_, vent\r\nof Carrick-a-raide, filled with coarse volcanic agglomerate; _d_\r\n_d_, bedded tuffs; _e_ _e_, large veins of basalt traversing the\r\nagglomerate; _f_ _f_, zone of tuffs and pisolitic iron ore; _g_ _g_,\r\nupper group of bedded basalts.]\r\n\r\nAn instructive example of the general characteristics of\r\nagglomerate-vents, and of the relation of these vents to the\r\nsurrounding tuffs and basalts, is to be found at the island of\r\nCarrick-a-raide, on the north coast of Antrim, and on the opposite\r\nmainland. The visible mass of this neck is about 1000 feet in diameter,\r\nbut the boundaries, except on the land side, are concealed by the sea.\r\nThe material filling up the vent is a coarse agglomerate, in which\r\nblocks and bombs of basalt, with pieces of chalk and flint, are stuck\r\nat all angles in a dull dirty-green granular tuff. Some large and small\r\nintrusions of basalt rise through it. Owing partly to these intrusions,\r\nand partly to the grass-covered slope that separates it from the line\r\nof cliff, the actual contact of this neck with the volcanic beds of the\r\nescarpment cannot be seen. I have no doubt, however, that the tuff,\r\nwhich has already been referred to as so conspicuous a member of the\r\nseries here, was discharged from this vent.[298] The materials are as\r\nusual coarser in the pipe than beyond it, but the finer portion or\r\nmatrix of the agglomerate is similar to many bands of the tuff. The\r\nstructure of the locality may be diagrammatically represented as in\r\nFig. 301. The bedded tuff is thickest in the neighbourhood of the vent,\r\nand gradually dies away on either side of it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 298: See Explanation of Sheets 7 and 8, _Geol. Survey of\r\nIreland_ (1888), p. 31.]\r\n\r\nBut another important inference may be drawn from this locality. I have\r\nalready pointed out that the lower basalts here reach their minimum\r\nthickness. Their basement beds thin away towards the vent as markedly\r\nas the tuff thickens. Obviously they cannot have proceeded from that\r\npoint of eruption. Yet, that they had begun to be poured out before\r\nthe discharge of the tuff is shown by their underlying as well as\r\noverlying that rock, though westward, owing to the thinning away of\r\nthe undermost basalts, the tuff comes to lie directly on the Chalk.\r\nHence, we may legitimately infer that in this neighbourhood one or more\r\nother vents supplied the sheets of the lower basalts.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Mull a number of detached bosses or patches of\r\nagglomerate much obscured by invasions of granophyre probably mark\r\nthe sites of volcanic vents. They will be more particularly noticed\r\nin Chapter xlvii. One of their most interesting features is the large\r\nnumber of fragments of felsitic or rhyolitic rocks which they contain.\r\n\r\nIn the promontory of Ardnamurchan, where the basalt-plateau has been\r\ninvaded and displaced by later intrusions of crystalline rocks, and has\r\nlikewise been reduced to such a fragmentary condition by denudation,\r\nsome interesting examples of agglomerate necks have been laid bare.\r\nOne of the largest of these occurs on the north shore at Faskadale.\r\nCut open by the sea for more than a quarter of a mile, this neck\r\nis seen to be filled with a coarse agglomerate, composed mainly of\r\nbasalt-blocks and debris, but crowded also with angular and subangular\r\npieces of different close-grained andesitic, felsitic and porphyritic\r\nrocks belonging to the acid series to be afterwards described.[299] Some\r\nof these stones exhibit a very perfect flow-structure, and closely\r\nresemble certain fine-grained, flinty, intrusive rocks in Mull, to\r\nwhich allusion will subsequently be made. The matrix of the agglomerate\r\nis of the usual dull dirty-green colour, but is so intensely indurated\r\nthat on a fresh fracture it can hardly be distinguished from some of\r\nthe crystalline rocks of the locality. The neck is pierced in all\r\ndirections with dykes and veins of basalt, dolerite, andesite, gabbro,\r\nand felsitic rocks. Similar intrusions continue and increase in numbers\r\nfarther west until the cliffs become a labyrinth of dykes and veins\r\nrunning through a mass of rocks which appears to consist mainly of dull\r\ndolerites and fine gabbros. Though the relations of this vent to the\r\nplateau-basalts are not quite plain, the agglomerate seemed to me to\r\nrise out of these rocks. At least the basalts extend from Achateny to\r\nFaskadale, but, as they are followed westwards, they are more and more\r\ninvaded by eruptive sheets, and assume the indurated character to which\r\nI have already referred.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 299: One of these felsites when viewed under a high magnifying\r\npower is seen to present an abundant development of exceedingly minute\r\nmicropegmatite arranged in patches and streaks parallel with the\r\nlines of flow-structure in the general cryptocrystalline groundmass.\r\nThe close relationship between the felsites, quartz-porphyries, and\r\ngranophyres will be afterwards pointed out in the description of the\r\nacid rocks. It is remarkable that, though these rocks occur abundantly\r\nin fragments in the volcanic necks and agglomerates of the plateaux,\r\nnot a single instance has been observed of their intercalation as\r\ncontemporaneous sheets among the basic lavas. The analogous case of the\r\ninterstratification of felsitic tuffs among basic lavas in the volcanic\r\nseries of the Old Red Sandstone of Central Scotland has been described\r\n(vol. i. p. 279). It is interesting to note that liparitic pumice and\r\ndykes have been erupted by some of the basaltic craters of Iceland, for\r\nexample at Askja, Öræfajökull and Snaefellsjökull. (Mr. Thoroddsen,\r\n_Dansk. Geograf. Tidsskrift_, vol. xiii. 7th and 8th parts.)]\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the peninsula of Ardnamurchan, another\r\nagglomerate, noticed by Professor Judd,[300] rises into the bold headland\r\nof Maclean's Nose, at the mouth of Loch Sunart, and affords better\r\nevidence of its relation to the bedded basalts. It measures about\r\n1000 yards in length by 300 in breadth, and its summit rises more\r\nthat 900 feet above the sea, which washes the base of its southern\r\nfront. It is filled with an agglomerate even coarser than that on\r\nthe northern coast. The blocks are of all sizes, up to eight or ten\r\nfeet in diameter. By far the largest proportion of them consists of\r\nvarieties of basalt and andesite, slaggy and vesicular structures\r\nbeing especially conspicuous. There are also large blocks of different\r\nandesitic porphyries and felsitic rocks like those just referred to,\r\na porphyry with felspar crystals two inches long being particularly\r\nabundant. All the stones are more or less rounded, and are wrapped\r\nup in a dull-green compact matrix of basalt-debris. There is no\r\nstratification or structure of any kind in the mass. Numerous dykes\r\nor veins of basalt, of andesite, and of a porphyry, resembling that\r\nof Craignure, in Mull, traverse the agglomerate. Some of the narrow\r\nbasalt-dykes cut through the others.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 300: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xxx. (1874), p. 261. Professor\r\nJudd has subsequently (_op. cit._ xlvi. 1890, pp. 374 _et seq._) given\r\na map, section and description of what he believes to be the structure\r\nof this ground, with numerous details as to the petrography of the\r\nrocks. The geological structure of this area is more fully referred to\r\non pp. 318 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 302.--Section of agglomerate Neck at Maclean's\r\nNose, Ardnamurchan.\r\n\r\n  _a_ _a_, quartzites and schists; _b_, bedded basalts lying partly\r\n  on the schists and partly on patches of Jurassic sandstones that\r\n  occupy hollows of the older crystalline rocks; _c_, agglomerate;\r\n  _d_ _d_, dykes and veins traversing the agglomerate; _e_, dolerite\r\n  sheets of Ben Hiant.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe position of the vent, with reference to the surrounding rocks, will\r\nbe understood from the accompanying section (Fig. 302). On the eastern\r\nside, the agglomerate can be seen to abut against the truncated ends\r\nof the flat beds of the plateau-basalts, which are of the usual bedded\r\ncompact and amygdaloidal character. There can be no doubt, therefore,\r\nthat the vent has been opened through these basalts. But it will be\r\nobserved that the latter belong to the lower part of the volcanic\r\nseries. These lowest sheets are exposed on the slope, resting upon\r\nyellowish and spotted grey sandstone, with seams of jet and a reddish\r\nbreccia, which, lying in hollows of the quartzites, quartz-schists, and\r\nmica-schists, form no doubt the local base of the Jurassic rocks of\r\nthe district. Hence, the vent, though younger than the older sheets of\r\nthe plateau, may quite well be contemporaneous with some of the later\r\nsheets.[301]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 301: It may here be remarked that there is evidence of great\r\ndifferences in the level of the base of the Jurassic series and\r\nthe bottom of the volcanic plateau in this district. On the south\r\nand west sides of Ben Hiant the Jurassic conglomerates may be seen\r\nlying on the edges of the crystalline schists only a little above\r\nhigh-water mark, while on the north side, the schists, with their\r\noverlying unconformable cake of limestones, rise several hundred feet\r\nabove sea-level. The surface on which the basalts were poured out was\r\nprobably very uneven, but there may also have been some considerable\r\ndisplacements of these basalts either before or during the injection of\r\nthe dolerite sills of Ben Hiant.]\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature at this locality is the peculiar grouping of\r\nsome of the large dykes in the area around the agglomerate. They run\r\nin the direction of the vent, and one or other of them may represent\r\nthe fissure or fissures on which the volcanic orifice was blown open\r\nto the surface. Another notable element in the geological structure\r\nof the ground is the vast amount of intrusive material, both in dykes\r\nand sheets, which has been erupted. The intrusive sheets of Ben\r\nHiant form the most prominent eminence in this part of Ardnamurchan.\r\nReserving them for description in the following Chapter (p. 318), I\r\nwill only remark here that they partly overlie the agglomerate, and\r\nare therefore, to some extent at least, younger than the vent. They\r\nbelong to that late stage in the history of the basalt-plateaux when\r\nthe molten material, no longer getting ready egress to the surface,\r\nforced its way among the rocks about the base of the bedded basalts,\r\nand more especially on the sites of older vents, which were doubtless\r\nweak places, where it could more easily find relief.\r\n\r\nThe large neck now described is only one of a group scattered around\r\nit in the ground to the north. Two of these may be seen rising through\r\na detached area of Jurassic limestones and shales at the northern base\r\nof Ben Hiant. A third, almost obliterated by the intrusive sheets, may\r\nbe traced at the western end of that mountain above Coiremhuilinn.\r\nTwo others rising through the schists on either side of Beinn na\r\nh-Urchrach, have been much invaded by the sills of that eminence\r\n(Fig. 326). It is doubtless owing to the extensive denudation of the\r\nbasalt-plateau, and the consequent uncovering of the rocks underneath\r\nit, that this series of vents has been laid bare.[302]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 302: Professor Judd has united these scattered vents into a\r\ncontinuous platform of volcanic agglomerates, which he represents as\r\nunderlying the supposed lavas of Ben Hiant. Since the publication\r\nof his map and description, I have re-examined the ground without\r\nbeing able to discover any trace of this platform. All the visible\r\nagglomerates are separate necks, their actual walls being sometimes\r\nexposed, as in the neck immediately north of the base of Ben Hiant,\r\nwhere the limestone in contact is marmorised, though twelve yards of it\r\nis an ordinary dull blue rock.]\r\n\r\nBy far the largest mass of agglomerate in any of the Tertiary volcanic\r\nareas of Britain is that which occurs on the north side of the main\r\nvalley of Strath, in Skye.[303] Unfortunately, it has been so seriously\r\ninvaded by the eruptive rocks of the Red Hills, that its original\r\ndimensions and its relations to the surrounding rocks, especially\r\nto the bedded basalts, are much obscured (see Fig. 348). It can be\r\nfollowed continuously from the lower end of Loch Kilchrist along the\r\nsouthern slopes of Beinn Dearg Bheag round to the western roots of\r\nBeinn Dearg Mhor--a distance of more than two miles in a straight\r\nline, and from Kilbride to the flank of Beinn na Caillich above\r\nCoire-chat-achan--a direct distance of two miles and a quarter. A\r\nsimilar rock, possibly a portion of the same mass, appears in Creagan\r\nDubha, on the north side of the Red Hills. If the whole of this\r\nagglomerate forms part of one originally continuous mass, it must have\r\nbeen upwards of two miles in diameter. There may, however, have been\r\ntwo or three closely adjacent vents. The Beinn na Caillich patch, for\r\nexample, appears to belong to a different area, and that of Creagan\r\nDubha is also probably distinct. But there seems no reason to doubt\r\nthat the mass which forms Cnoc nam Fitheach, and all the long declivity\r\non the southern flank of Beinn Dearg Bheag, occupies part of the site\r\nof a single volcano. Owing to the absence of sufficient sections, it\r\nis hardly possible to determine how much of this fragmentary material\r\nshould be assigned to the actual chimney. The diameter of the whole\r\nmass is almost two miles. But possibly a considerable proportion of\r\nthis accumulation belongs to the external cone which gathered round\r\nthe vent, so that the eruptive pipe might thus be of much smaller\r\ndimensions than the superficial area of the agglomerate. The subsequent\r\ninvasion of so much granophyre, not only that of the Red Hills, but\r\nthat of numerous smaller intrusions, has indurated the agglomerate and\r\nmade the investigation of its structure somewhat unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 303: This extensive mass was not separated from the \"syenite\"\r\nof the Red Hills by Macculloch. Von Oeynhausen and Von Dechen noticed\r\nit as a conglomerate with quartz pebbles, but did not realise its\r\nvolcanic nature (_Karsten's Archiv_, i. p. 90). In my map of Strath\r\n(_Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ xiv. plate i.) I distinguished it from the\r\nrock of the Red Hills, but no name for it appears in the legend of\r\nthe map, nor is it referred to in the text. Its character as a true\r\nvolcanic agglomerate was recognised by Professor Judd, _op. cit._ p.\r\n255. See _postea_, pp. 384 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that the mere existence of intrusive bosses and\r\nveins rather furnishes an argument in favour of considering the visible\r\nagglomerate to belong to a deeper-seated part of the erupted material\r\nthan the external cone. But, as will be afterwards shown, there is\r\nsome reason to regard the present conical or dome-shaped outlines of\r\nthe granophyre hills as not far from their original forms, and to\r\nbelieve that, like the trachytic Puys of Auvergne, they were much more\r\nsuperficial than plutonic eruptions. A study of the cinder cones of\r\nCentral France shows that even these superficial accumulations have\r\nbeen invaded not only by bosses but by dykes.[304]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 304: The existence of a small dyke of andesite on the northern\r\nrim of the well-known crater of the Puy Parion has already been\r\nnoticed.]\r\n\r\nThe agglomerate of the great Strath vent is a coarse tumultuous\r\nassemblage of blocks and bombs, imbedded in the usual dull, dirty-green\r\nmatrix. Among the stones, grit and sandstone, together with\r\nscoriaceous, vesicular and amygdaloidal basalts are specially abundant;\r\nalso pieces of various quartz-porphyries and granophyres, among which\r\na black felsite like that of Mull may often be recognised. In some\r\nplaces, large masses of altered limestone and quartzite (Cambrian)\r\nare included; in others, pieces of yellow sandstone and dark shale\r\n(Jurassic), or of the bedded lavas. Some of these masses may be 100\r\nyards or more in length. Occasionally a breccia, mainly made up of acid\r\nmaterials--granophyre or granite,--has been noticed by Mr. Harker along\r\nthe north side of the Red Hills, which he thinks may rather be of the\r\nnature of a crush-breccia than a part of the true agglomerate.\r\n\r\nThe agglomerate of this district is wholly without stratification\r\nor structure of any kind. On the north-west side of Loch Kilchrist,\r\nindeed, it weathers into large tabular forms, the parallel surfaces\r\nof which dip to south-west; but this is probably due only to\r\njointing. Here and there, dykes of basalt cut the rock in a general\r\nnorth-westerly direction, but their number is remarkably small when\r\ncompared with the prodigious quantity of them in the limestone at the\r\nbottom and opposite side of the valley, some of which may possibly mark\r\nthe fissure on which the vent was placed. More abundant and extensive\r\nare the masses of granophyre that rise particularly along the outer\r\nmargin of the agglomerate near Loch Kilchrist. These may be connected\r\nwith the great boss that forms the Red Hills, of which further details\r\nwill be given in Chapter xlvi.[305]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 305: The granophyre intrusions in this agglomerate have been\r\nfound by Mr. Harker to have taken up and dissolved a considerable\r\nproportion of fragments of gabbro, Chapter xlvi. p. 392.]\r\n\r\nThe important question of the relation of this agglomerate to the\r\nplateau-basalts does not admit of satisfactory treatment, owing to\r\ndestruction of the evidence by the intrusion of the granophyre, and\r\nlikewise to enormous denudation. Nevertheless, some traces still remain\r\nto indicate that the basalts once stretched over the site of the vent,\r\nwhich probably rose through them. Looking westward from the Hanks of\r\nBeinn Dearg Bheag to the other side of Loch Slapin, the geologist sees\r\nthe bold basalt-escarpment of Strathaird presenting its truncated beds\r\nto him at a distance of only two miles. That these lavas were once\r\nprolonged eastwards beyond their present limits is obvious, and that\r\nthey stretched at least over these two intervening miles can hardly\r\nbe doubted. But we can still detect relics of them on the flanks of\r\nBeinn Dearg. As we follow the agglomerate round the margin of the\r\ngranophyre that mounts steeply from it, we lose it here and there under\r\nbeds of amygdaloidal basalt. The rocks next the great eruptive mass of\r\nthe mountain are so indurated and shattered that it is difficult to\r\nseparate them from each other and determine their relative positions.\r\nBut, so far as I could ascertain, these basalts are fragments of beds\r\nthat overlie the agglomerate (Fig. 303). This is not the only place\r\nalong the flanks of the Red Hills where portions of the bedded basalts\r\nhave survived. Other localities will be subsequently alluded to.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 303.--Diagram to show the probable relations of the rocks on\r\n  the southern flank of Beinn Dearg Bheag.\r\n\r\n  _a_, agglomerate; _b_, amygdaloidal and compact basalt-rocks; _c_,\r\n  granophyre.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Strath vent has been drilled through the Cambrian limestone, and\r\nas the result of protracted denudation it now towers steeply 500 or\r\n600 feet above that formation on the floor of the valley. Of the\r\nmaterial discharged from it over the surrounding country no certain\r\ntrace now remains. We may infer from the nature of the rock which fills\r\nit that towards the end, if not from the beginning of its activity,\r\nits discharges consisted mainly of dust and stones. A cone, of which\r\nthe remains are two miles in diameter, must surely have sent its\r\nfragmentary materials far and wide over the surrounding region. But on\r\nthe bare platform of older rocks to the south, beyond the bottom of\r\nthe agglomerate declivities, not a vestige of these erupted materials\r\ncan now be found. Westward the escarpment of Strathaird remains to\r\nassure us that no thick showers of ashes fell at even so short a\r\ndistance as two miles, either before or during the outpouring of the\r\nsuccessive basalt sheets still remaining there. We may therefore\r\nconclude with some confidence that here, as at Ardnamurchan, the\r\nvent is younger than at least the older parts of the basalt-plateau.\r\nUnfortunately the uprise of the large bosses of granophyre that stretch\r\nfrom the Red Hills to Loch Sligachan has entirely destroyed the vent\r\nand its connections in that direction. There is no certain proof that\r\nany molten rock ever issued from this orifice, unless we suppose the\r\nfragmentary patches of amygdaloid on the southern flank of Beinn Dearg\r\nBheag to be portions of flows that proceeded from this centre of\r\neruption. The basalt-plateau which still remains in Strathaird no doubt\r\nformerly extended eastwards over Strath and northwards across the site\r\nof the Red Hills and Cuillins, joining on to the continuous tableland\r\nnorth of Lochs Brittle and Sligachan. How much of the plateau had been\r\nbuilt up here before the outburst of the vent cannot be ascertained.\r\nThe agglomerate may possibly, of course, belong to the very latest\r\nperiod of the plateau-eruptions, or even to a still younger phase of\r\nTertiary volcanic history. The impression, however, made on my mind by\r\na study of the evidence from the Western and Faroe Isles is that the\r\nnecks of agglomerate, like those of dolerite and basalt, really belong\r\nto different epochs of the plateau period itself; and mark some of\r\nthe vents from which the materials of the plateaux were successively\r\nemitted.\r\n\r\nThe example of Carrick-a-raide (p. 277) is peculiarly suggestive when\r\nwe regard it in connexion with the great Strath vent. Already the\r\nprogress of denudation has removed at least half of the layer of dust\r\nand stones which, thrown out from that little orifice, fell over the\r\nbare chalk-wolds and black basalt-fields of Antrim. The neck that\r\nmarks the position of the volcanic funnel has been largely cut away\r\nby the waves, and is almost entirely isolated among them. The vents\r\nat Canna, Portree and the Faroe Isles, to be afterwards described,\r\nunquestionably belong to the eruptions of the plateau-period, for their\r\nconnection with the basalts can be clearly established. At the Strath\r\nvent, however, the march of destruction has been greater. The connexion\r\nbetween this vent and the materials ejected from it has been entirely\r\nremoved, and we can only guess from the size of the remaining neck what\r\nmay have been the area covered by the discharges from this largest of\r\nall the volcanic cones of the Inner Hebrides.\r\n\r\nOther masses of similar agglomerate are observable in the same region\r\nof Skye, where they not improbably mark the sites of other vents.\r\nUnfortunately their original limits and relations to the rocks through\r\nwhich the eruptive orifices were drilled have been much obscured by\r\nthe uprise of the great masses of gabbro and granophyre of the Cuillin\r\nHills. Several of these isolated intrusions occur in the midst of the\r\ngabbro, as in Harta Corry and on the west side of the Blaven ridge.\r\nAnother mass is interposed between the gabbro and granophyre on Druim\r\nan Eidhne and at the base of the lavas between Druim an Eidhne and\r\nthe Camasunary valley. Mr. Harker has found a huge mass of agglomerate\r\nunderlying the bedded basalts to the north and west of Belig, one of\r\nthe hills on the west side of the large valley that runs from the head\r\nof Loch Slapin to Loch Aynort. This mass has its bottom concealed by\r\nthe granophyre which underlies it; but it reaches a maximum thickness\r\nof perhaps 1000 feet, rapidly thinning out and disappearing. It\r\ngenerally resembles the Strath agglomerate, but is distinguished by\r\nincluding a large proportion of fragments of gabbro. Mr. Harker remarks\r\nthat \"a study of these agglomerates points to the existence of both\r\ngabbros and granophyres older than the volcanic series, and therefore\r\ndistinct from the gabbros and granophyres now exposed at the surface.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a suggestive fact that so many detached masses of agglomerate\r\nshould occur around and within the areas of the great eruptive bosses\r\nof gabbro and granophyre. They seem to indicate the former existence\r\nof groups of volcanic vents in these tracts, and may thus account for\r\nthe uprise of such large bodies of intrusive material through what must\r\nhave been a weakened part of the terrestrial crust.\r\n\r\nFurther north in Skye a much smaller but more perfectly preserved\r\nvent has been laid open by denudation on the south side of Portree\r\nBay--a deep inlet which has been cut out of the plateau-basalts and\r\ntheir underlying platform of Jurassic sandstones and shales. The great\r\nescarpment of the basalts has, at the recess of Camas Garbh, been\r\ntrenched by a small rivulet, aided by the presence of two dykes. The\r\ngully thus formed exposes a section of a neck of agglomerate that\r\nunderlies the basalts of the upper half of the cliff. This neck is\r\nconnected with a thick deposit of volcanic conglomerate and tuff which,\r\nlying between the basalts, extends from the neck to a considerable\r\ndistance on either hand. The general relations of the rocks at this\r\nlocality are represented in Fig. 304.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 304.--Section of Volcanic Vent and connected lavas\r\nand tuffs, Scorr, Camas Garbh, Portree Bay, Skye.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Rudely-bedded dull green tuff; _b_, coarse agglomerate;\r\n  _c_, prismatic basalt; _d_, massive jointed basalt; _e_, red\r\n  banded decomposing rock, probably of detrital origin; _f_,\r\n  plateau-basalts, prismatic and rudely columnar; _g_, dyke of\r\n  dolerite, somewhat vesicular, five to six feet broad; _h_, basalt\r\n  dyke two to three feet broad; _i_, dyke or sill of similar basalt\r\n  to _h_, and possibly connected with it.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe agglomerate (_b_) is quite tumultuous, and here and there\r\nstrikingly coarse. Some of its included blocks measure five feet in\r\nlength. These fragments represent most of the varieties of the lavas\r\nof the district. Large slaggy masses are abundant among them, and\r\nsometimes exhibit the annelide-like elongation of the vesicles which\r\nI have referred to as occasionally displayed by the plateau-basalts.\r\nMore than 60 feet of agglomerate are visible in vertical height from\r\nwhere its base is concealed by debris and vegetation to where its\r\nupper surface passes under a banded rock to be afterwards described.\r\nThat this unstratified mass of volcanic detritus marks the site of a\r\nvent can hardly be doubted, although denudation has not revealed the\r\nactual walls of the chimney. The steep grassy slopes do not permit\r\nthe relations of the rocks to be everywhere seen, but the agglomerate\r\nappears to pass laterally into finer, rudely-stratified material of a\r\nsimilar kind, which extends towards east and west as a thick deposit\r\nbetween the bedded basalts. Possibly denudation has only advanced far\r\nenough to lay bare the crater and its surrounding sheets of fragmentary\r\nmaterial, while the chimney lies still buried underneath.\r\n\r\nTo the east or left of the agglomerate the detritus becomes less\r\ncoarse, and shows increasing indications of a bedded arrangement. Close\r\nto the agglomerate the dip of the coarse tuff is towards that rock at\r\nabout 10°. A few yards further east a sheet of very slaggy basalt is\r\nseen to lie against the tuff, which it does not pierce. The vesicles\r\nin this adhering cake of lava have been pulled out in the direction of\r\nthe slope till they have become narrow tubes four or five inches long\r\nand parallel to each other. Some parts of this rock have a curved ropy\r\nsurface, like that of well-known Vesuvian lavas, suggestive of the\r\nmolten rock having flowed in successive thin viscous sheets down the\r\nslope, which has a declivity of about 30°. This part of the section may\r\npossibly preserve a fragment of the actual inner slope of the crater\r\nformed of rudely-bedded tuffs.\r\n\r\nContinuing still eastward, we find the feebly stratified tuff (_a_) to\r\nbe perhaps 200 feet thick. It forms a grassy declivity that descends\r\nfrom the basalt-escarpment above to the grass-covered platform which\r\noverlies a lower group of basalts. The visible portion of this tuff\r\npresents a thoroughly volcanic character, being made up of the usual\r\ndull dirty-green granular paste, through which are dispersed angular\r\nand rough lumps of slag and pieces of more solid basalt, varying up\r\nto a foot or two feet in length. These stones are generally disposed\r\nparallel to the indistinct bedding, but are sometimes placed on end,\r\nas if they had assumed that position on falling from an explosive\r\nshower. Among the smaller stones, pieces of a finely vesicular basic\r\npumice are frequent and are among the most strikingly volcanic products\r\nof the deposit. From a characteristic sample of these stones, a thin\r\nslice was prepared and placed in Mr. Harker's hands. The following are\r\nhis observations on it:--\"A very compact dark grey rock, amygdaloidal\r\non a minute scale. The lighter grey crust is probably due merely to\r\nweathering, and the specimen seems to be a distinct fragment, not a\r\ntrue bomb. The slice shows it to be essentially a brown glass with only\r\noccasional microscopic crystals of a basic plagioclase. It has been\r\nhighly vesicular, and the vesicles are now filled by various secondary\r\nproducts, including a chloritic mineral, nearly colourless and singly\r\nrefracting in thin section, and a zeolite.\"\r\n\r\nTracing now the tuff from the west or right side of the vent, we can\r\nfollow it to a greater distance. No abrupt line can be detected here,\r\nany more than on the other side, between the agglomerate and the tuff.\r\nThe latter rock extends under the overlying plateau of basalt, at least\r\nas far west as Portree Loch, a distance of fully a mile, but rapidly\r\ndiminishes in thickness in that direction. Traces of what is probably\r\nthe same tuff can be detected between the basalts at Ach na Hannait,\r\nmore than three miles to the south (Fig. 305). It is thus probable that\r\nfrom the Portree vent fragmentary discharges took place over an area of\r\nseveral square miles.\r\n\r\nAbove the agglomerate of this vent two lavas may be seen to start\r\ntowards opposite directions. One of these (_c_), already referred to,\r\nis a dull prismatic basalt with a slaggy bottom, its vesicles being\r\npulled out in the direction of the general bedding of the section. It\r\ndescends by a twist or step, and then lies on the inclined surface of\r\nthe tuff which dips towards the agglomerate and seems to pass into\r\nthat rock. Further east this basalt increases in thickness and forms\r\nthe lowest of the basalt-sheets of the cliff. The lava that commences\r\non the west side of the agglomerate (_d_) is a massive jointed basalt,\r\nwhich, though not seen at the vent, appears immediately to the west of\r\nit and rapidly swells out so as to become one of the thickest sheets of\r\nthe locality. It lies upon the rudely-bedded tuff, and is covered by\r\nthe other basalts of the cliff.\r\n\r\nThat these two basalts came out of this vent cannot be affirmed. If\r\nthey did so at different times, their emission must have been followed\r\nby the explosion which cleared the funnel and left the central mass\r\nof agglomerate there. But that some kind of saucer-shaped depression\r\nwas still left above the site of the vent is indicated by the curious\r\nelliptical mass of rock (_e_) that lies immediately above the\r\nagglomerate, from which it is sharply marked off. This is one of the\r\nmost puzzling rocks in the district, probably in large measure owing to\r\nits advanced state of decay. It is dull-red in colour, and decomposes\r\ninto roughly parallel layers, so that at a short distance it looks like\r\na bedded tuff, or like some of the crumbling varieties of banded lavas.\r\nI could not obtain specimens fresh enough to put its nature and origin\r\nbeyond dispute. Whatever may have been its history, this ferruginous\r\nrock rests in a flat basin-shaped hollow directly above the agglomerate\r\nof the vent. The form of this depression corresponds fairly well with\r\nwhat we may suppose to have been the final position and shape of the\r\ncrater of the little volcano. The rock that occupies the bowl dies out\r\ntowards the east on the face of the cliff, and the prismatic basalt\r\n(_c_) is then immediately covered by the rest of the basalt-sheets\r\nof the plateau (_f_). On the west side its precise termination is\r\nconcealed by grass. But it must rapidly dwindle in that direction\r\nalso, for not many yards away it is found to have disappeared, and the\r\nbasalts (_d_ and _f_) come together.\r\n\r\nThough the decayed state of this rock does not warrant any very\r\nconfident opinion regarding its history, I am inclined to look upon\r\nit as a deposit of much disintegrated volcanic detritus washed into\r\nthe hollow of the old crater when it had become filled with water, and\r\nhad passed into the condition of a _maar_. The peculiarly oxidized\r\ncondition of its materials points probably to long atmospheric\r\nexposure, and an examination of the surrounding parts of the district\r\nfurnishes more or less distinct evidence that a considerable lapse of\r\ntime did actually intervene between the cessation of the eruptions of\r\nthe Portree volcano and the next great basalt-floods of this part of\r\nSkye.\r\n\r\nThat volcanic eruptions from other vents continued after the Portree\r\nvent had become extinct is proved by the great sheets of basalt (_f_)\r\nthat overspread it, and still bury a large tract of the fragmentary\r\nmaterial which it discharged. At a later time a fissure that was\r\nopened across the vent, allowed the uprise of a basalt dyke (_g_), and\r\nsubsequently another injection of similar material took place along the\r\nsame line of weakness (_h_).\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this interesting locality we may briefly take note\r\nof the distribution of the ashes and stones ejected by the volcano,\r\nand the evidence for the relative length of the interval between\r\nthe outflow of the lavas below and that of those above the tuff\r\nand volcanic conglomerate. These deposits may be traced in clear\r\nsections along the base of the cliffs for a mile to the west of the\r\nvent. They thin away so rapidly in that direction that at a distance\r\nof three-quarters of a mile they do not much exceed fifty feet in\r\nthickness. At Camas Bàn they consist mainly of a fine, dull-green,\r\ngranular, rudely-stratified basalt-tuff, through which occasional\r\nangular pieces of different lavas and rough slags are irregularly\r\ndispersed. These stones occur here and there in rows, suggestive of\r\nmore vigorous discharges, the layers between the platforms of coarser\r\ndetritus being occupied by fine tuff. Some of the ejected blocks are\r\nimbedded on end--an indication of the force with which they were\r\nprojected so as to fall nearly a mile from the crater.\r\n\r\nThe upper parts of the tuff pass upward into fine yellow, brown, and\r\nblack clays a few feet in thickness, the darker layers being full of\r\ncarbonaceous streaks. On this horizon the coal of Portree was formerly\r\nmined. The workings, however, have long been abandoned, and, owing to\r\nthe fall of large blocks from the basalt-cliff overhead, the entrance\r\nto the mine is almost completely blocked up. One wooden prop may still\r\nbe seen keeping up the roof of the adit, which is here a slaggy basalt.\r\n\r\nTo the east and south-east of the Portree vent, extensive landslips\r\nof the volcanic series and of the underlying Jurassic formations make\r\nit hardly possible to trace the continuation of the tuff-zone in that\r\ndirection. To the south, however, at a distance of rather more than\r\nthree miles, what is probably the same stratigraphical horizon may be\r\nconveniently examined from Ach na Hannait for some way to the north\r\nof Tianavaig Bay. At the former locality the calcareous sandstones\r\nof the Inferior Oolite are unconformably covered by the group of\r\nrocks represented in Fig. 305. At the bottom of the volcanic series\r\nlies a sheet of nodular dolerite with a slaggy upper surface (_a_).\r\nWrapping round the projections and filling up the depressions of this\r\nlava comes a thin group of sedimentary strata from an inch or two to\r\neighteen inches or more in thickness (_b_). These deposits consist of\r\nhardened shale charged with macerated fragments of linear leaves and\r\nother plant-remains, including and passing into streaks of coal, which\r\nmay be looked upon as probably occupying the same horizon with the\r\ncoal of Portree. But here, instead of reposing on a mass of stratified\r\ntuff, the carbonaceous layers lie on one of the bedded lavas. The tuff\r\nhas died out in the intervening three miles, yet that some of the\r\ndischarges of volcanic detritus reached even to this distance, and\r\nthat they took place during the accumulation of these layers of mud\r\nand vegetation, is shown by the occurrence in the shales of pieces of\r\nfinely amygdaloidal basalt, from less than an inch to six inches in\r\nlength, likewise lapilli of a fine minutely cellular basic pumice, like\r\nsome varieties of palagonite. The overlying dolerite (_c_) becomes\r\nfinely prismatic at its junction with the sedimentary layers and has\r\nprobably indurated them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 305.--Section of the Volcanic Series at Ach na Hannait, south\r\n  of Portree, Skye.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis intercalation of a shaly and coaly band among the lavas can be\r\nfollowed northward along the coast. In some places it has been invaded\r\nby dykes, sills, and threads of basalt on the most remarkably minute\r\nscale, of which I shall give some account in Chapter xlii. (see Fig.\r\n321). North of Tianavaig Bay--that is, about three-quarters of a mile\r\nnearer to the Portree vent--a perceptible increase in the amount of\r\nvolcanic material is observable among the shales and leaf-beds. Not\r\nonly are lapilli of basic pumice abundant, but the volcanic detritus\r\nhas accumulated here and there in sufficient amount to form a band of\r\ndull greenish-brown tuff.\r\n\r\nThese coast-sections in the neighbourhood of Portree afford additional\r\nillustrations of the characteristic fact, on which I have already\r\ninsisted, that the interstratifications of sedimentary material in the\r\nbasalt-plateaux frequently terminate upward in leaf-beds, thin coals,\r\nor layers of shale, full of indistinctly preserved remains of plants.\r\nAs I have endeavoured to show, this vegetation, which was undoubtedly\r\nterrestrial, probably grew not far from the sites where its remains\r\nhave been preserved. Leaves and seeds would naturally be blown or\r\nwashed into pools on the lava-fields, and would gather there among\r\nthe mud and sand carried by rain from the surrounding ground. Such a\r\ntopography and such a sequence of events point to intervals of longer\r\nor shorter duration between the successive outpourings of basalt. It\r\nwas probably during one of these intervals of quietude that the crater\r\nof the Portree volcano became a _maar_ and was finally silted up.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to a conspicuous mass of agglomerate\r\nwhich occurs at the east end of the island of Canna, and marks the site\r\nof an important volcanic vent belonging to the Small Isles plateau. A\r\nportion of it projects from the grassy slopes, and rises vertically\r\nabove the beach as a picturesque crag, in front of the precipice of\r\nCompass Hill (Fig. 306). But the same rock may be traced southward to\r\nthe Coroghon Mòr, and north-westward in the lower part of the cliffs to\r\na little beyond the sea-stack of An Stòll. It has thus a diameter of at\r\nleast 3000 feet. Westward it passes under the conglomerate described in\r\nChapter xxxviii. Its eastern extension has been concealed by the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 306.--View of part of a Volcanic Neck at the\r\neastern end of the island of Canna. (From a photograph by Miss Thom.)]\r\n\r\nThe materials that fill this vent consist of a typical agglomerate\r\ncomposed entirely, or almost entirely, of volcanic detritus. The\r\nembedded blocks vary up to eight feet in diameter or even more. They\r\nare chiefly fragments of various basalts and andesites, generally\r\nvesicular or amygdaloidal. Some of these, which have evidently been\r\nbroken off from already consolidated lavas, are angular or subangular\r\nin shape, and their steam-holes are cut across by the outer surfaces\r\nof the stones. Where they consist of calcite, zeolite, etc., the\r\namygdales so exactly resemble those of the bedded basalts of the\r\nplateaux that, as already remarked, we must believe them to have been\r\nalready filled by infiltration before the disruption of the rocks by\r\nvolcanic explosions. Other blocks are true bombs, with a fine-grained\r\ncrust outside and a more cellular texture inside, the vesicles of the\r\nouter crust being sometimes dragged round the surface of the stone.\r\nThe variety of materials included among the ejected blocks and the\r\nabundance of pieces of the red bole which so generally separates the\r\nplateau-basalts indicate that a considerable thickness of bedded lavas\r\nhas probably been broken through by the vent.\r\n\r\nBeside the volcanic materials, occasional angular pieces of red\r\n(Torridon) sandstone may be observed in the agglomerate. The paste is a\r\ncomminuted mass of the same material as the blocks, tolerably compact,\r\nand entirely without any trace of stratification.\r\n\r\nThe actual margin of this vent has nowhere been detected by me. We\r\nnever reach here the base of the volcanic series, for it is sunk under\r\nthe sea-level. On the other hand, the upper limits of the agglomerate\r\nhave been partially effaced or obscured by the conglomerates which\r\noverlie it. From the breadth of ground across which the agglomerate\r\ncan be followed along the shore, the vent might be regarded as having\r\nbeen perhaps not less than three-quarters of a mile in diameter. But\r\nthere is the same difficulty here as at the Strath vent in Skye in\r\ndetermining the actual limits of the volcanic funnel. Possibly there\r\nmay have been more than one vent in close proximity. Even if there was\r\nonly one, the existing agglomerate may include not only what filled the\r\nchimney, but also a portion of what had accumulated round the orifice\r\nand formed the external cone. That the volcano continued for some time\r\nin vigorous eruption may be judged from the amount of material ejected\r\nfrom it, the large size of its blocks, and the distance to which they\r\nwere sometimes thrown.\r\n\r\nThe pieces of Torridon Sandstone were no doubt derived from the\r\nextension of that formation underneath Canna. On the opposite island of\r\nRum, where these pre-Cambrian red sandstones are copiously developed,\r\nthey form the platform through which the Tertiary volcanic series has\r\nbeen erupted. The several remaining outliers of the bedded basalts,\r\nreferred to in a previous chapter (p. 215 and Fig. 267) as visible on\r\nthe west side of this island, show that the basalt-plateau of Small\r\nIsles, which once covered that area, rested immediately on the inclined\r\nedges of the Torridon Sandstones. Probably the same structure stretches\r\nwestward under Canna and Sanday. No traces of any Jurassic strata\r\nhave been detected beneath the volcanic rocks of Rum, though they\r\nare so well developed a few miles to the east in the island of Eigg.\r\nEither they were not deposited over the pre-Cambrian rocks of Rum, or\r\nthey had been removed from that ancient ridge before the beginning\r\nof the Tertiary volcanic period. Certainly I have not detected a\r\nsingle recognizable fragment of any Jurassic sedimentary rock in the\r\nagglomerate of Canna.\r\n\r\nThis Canna vent exhibits, better than is usually shown, the occurrence\r\nof dykes and irregular injections of lava through the agglomerate.\r\nA large mass of a finely columnar basalt runs up from the beach at\r\nGarbh Asgarnish. A similar rock forms several detached crags a little\r\nfurther south, particularly in the headland of Coroghon Mòr and the\r\nisland of Alman. Here the basalt is beautifully columnar, its slender\r\nprisms curving from a central line until their ends abut against the\r\nagglomerate. The truly intrusive character of this basalt is well shown\r\non the southern front of Coroghon Mòr, and on the northern face of\r\nAlman, as represented in the accompanying diagrams (Figs. 307 and 308).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 307.--Columnar Basalt invading Agglomerate of Volcanic Vent,\r\n  Coroghon Mòr, Isle of Canna. (Height above 20 feet.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 308.--Columnar Basalt invading Volcanic Conglomerate, north\r\n  side of Alman Islet, Canna.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no conclusive evidence that these intrusions belong\r\nto the time of the activity of the vent, yet they differ so much from\r\nthe ordinary dykes (one of which also cuts the agglomerate and ascends\r\nthrough the conglomerates and basalts above), are confined so markedly\r\nto the vent and its immediate proximity, and resemble so closely the\r\nbasalt-injections of other vents, such as those of the Carboniferous\r\nand Permian necks of Scotland, that they may with probability be\r\nregarded as part of the mechanism of the Canna volcano.\r\n\r\nThough the form and size of the vent of this volcano cannot be\r\nprecisely defined, the upper part of its agglomerate, as we have seen\r\n(_ante_, p. 219), is dovetailed in the most interesting way with the\r\nseries of coarse conglomerates, which indicate strong river-action in\r\nthis part of the volcanic area during the time of the eruption of the\r\nplateau-basalts.\r\n\r\nThe agglomerate vents described in the foregoing pages as occurring\r\nin Antrim and among the Inner Hebrides all appear either in the midst\r\nof the plateau-basalts or in close proximity to them. Before quitting\r\nthe Scottish examples, I may refer to some that rise through much more\r\nancient formations at a distance from any portion of the volcanic\r\nplateaux, and yet may with probability be assigned to the Tertiary\r\nvolcanic period.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the Geological Survey through the district of\r\nApplecross, in the western part of the mainland of Ross-shire, and far\r\naway from the basalt-plateau of Skye, Mr. John Horne[306] has found two\r\nsmall necks rising on each side of a line of fracture, through gently\r\ninclined Torridon Sandstones. They are conspicuous from a distance by\r\nthe verdure of their slopes, in contrast with the brown tints of the\r\nsurrounding moorland. The larger of the two necks measures about 180 by\r\n150 feet, and abruptly truncates the beds of Torridon Sandstone, which\r\nas they approach it assume a bleached aspect and become indurated.\r\nThe material filling this vent is an agglomerate made up mainly of\r\npieces of Torridon Sandstone and grit which, though generally small,\r\noccasionally measure a foot across, and in one case were found to reach\r\na length of four feet. They are not as a rule markedly altered, but\r\nsome of them have acquired a glazed or vitreous texture. Besides these\r\nfragments of the general rock of the district, there occur abundant\r\nlapilli of a basic volcanic rock, found by Mr. Teall to consist of\r\nporphyritic felspar, extremely minute acicular microlites of felspar,\r\nsomewhat irregular transparent spaces now occupied by a yellowish-green\r\nsubstance, and interstitial matter. At the south end of the vent a\r\nsmall mass of decayed basalt appears to pierce the agglomerate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 306: _Trans. Geol. Soc. Edin._ vii. (1894), p. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 309.--View of neck-like mass of breccia, Brochel,\r\nRaasay.]\r\n\r\nThough there is no indication of the age of these necks, they agree\r\nso closely in general character with known vents of the Tertiary\r\nvolcanic plateaux that there cannot be much hesitation in regarding\r\nthem as dating from the same great period of basalt-eruption. But no\r\nrelic now exists anywhere around of lavas or tuffs ejected from them.\r\nThey rise on the bare Applecross hills, 1000 feet above sea-level, two\r\nmiles from the shore, and about ten miles from the nearest outlier of\r\nthe basalt-plateau in the Dùn Can of Raasay. If they once discharged\r\nstreams of lava that united with the rest of the plateau, the total\r\ndestruction of this lava affords another impressive picture of the\r\nwaste which the volcanic rocks of the Inner Hebrides have undergone.\r\n\r\nThe large proportion of Torridon Sandstone blocks in these two\r\nApplecross necks suggests, however, that the orifices never became\r\nactive volcanic vents. They may have been mere spiracles, or\r\nblow-holes, where the funnels drilled by explosive vapours were filled\r\nup with the debris of the rocks that were blown out. But that lava did\r\nrise within them is shown by the basic lapilli in the agglomerate, and\r\nby the basalt which in both vents has found its way up the chimney.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Raasay Mr. Teall, during the summer of 1894,\r\nobserved a group of curious neck-like masses of breccia which pierce\r\nthe Torridon Sandstone near Brochel (Fig. 309). The blocks in them\r\nare large angular unaltered pieces of the surrounding sandstones\r\nand shales, sometimes ten feet or more in length, and the matrix is\r\nsometimes pure crystalline calcite like Iceland spar. The breccia is\r\ngenerally coarsest towards the outer margin. But though the Lewisian\r\ngneiss exists immediately below the thin cake of Torridonian strata,\r\nnot a fragment of it could either Mr. Teall or I, when I visited the\r\nlocality with him, find among the components of the breccia. Nor did\r\nwe detect any trace of volcanic material. The general ground-plan of\r\nthese masses is elliptical, the most northerly measuring 30 yards in\r\ndiameter. Where the junction of the breccia with the Torridon strata\r\ncan be seen it is a nearly vertical one, the sandstones and shales\r\nbeing much jumbled and broken, but not sensibly indurated. This little\r\ncluster of patches of breccia can hardly be due to local crushing of\r\nthe rocks. Their definite outlines and composition seem rather to\r\nindicate spiracles of Tertiary time, which never became vents erupting\r\nlava or ashes. The absence of fragments of the underlying gneiss may be\r\naccounted for if we suppose that the orifices were completely cleared\r\nout by the violence of the explosions and were afterwards filled up\r\nby the falling in of the walls of the higher parts now removed by\r\ndenudation, which consisted of Torridon Sandstone and shale.[307]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 307: It is on one of these neck-like patches of breccia that\r\nBrochel Castle stands, of which Macculloch gave so sensational a\r\npicture in one of the plates of his _Western Isles_.]\r\n\r\nFurther research may detect at still greater distances from the\r\nbasalt-plateaux ancient volcanic necks that might, with more or less\r\nprobability, be referred to the Tertiary period. As an instance of this\r\nkind, I refer to the neck at Bunowen, County Galway, recently described\r\nby Mr. M'Henry and Professor Sollas. Though so remote from the Tertiary\r\nbasalt-plateaux, the rock of this boss is an olivine-basalt presenting\r\na close resemblance to some of the rocks of Antrim.[308]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 308: _Trans. Roy. Irish Acad._, 1896].\r\n\r\nAs a final illustration of Tertiary volcanic vents I will now describe\r\nthe Faroe group already alluded to (vol. i. p. 63, vol. ii. p. 256).\r\nIt was almost by a kind of happy accident that these vents were\r\ndiscovered. Noticing at a distance of a mile or more from the deck of\r\na steam-yacht that the base of the great basalt cliffs on the west\r\nside of Stromö were varied by what looked like agglomerate, I steamed\r\ninshore, and was delighted to find, as the vessel drew near to the\r\ncliff, that the agglomerate assumed definite boundaries and occurred in\r\nseveral distinct patches, until at last it presented the unmistakable\r\noutlines of a group of vents underlying and overspread by the bedded\r\nbasalts of the plateau. Favoured by an unusually calm sea, I was\r\nenabled to boat into every nook and round every buttress and islet of\r\nthis part of the coast-line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 310.--View of Volcanic Neck piercing and overlain\r\nby the Plateau-Basalts, Stromö, entrance of Vaagöfjord, Faroe Islands.\r\n\r\n(From a photograph by Colonel Evans.)]\r\n\r\nThe basalt-plateau here presents to the western ocean a nearly vertical\r\nescarpment which must reach a height of at least 1000 feet (see Fig.\r\n328), and displays a magnificent section of the bedded lavas. The\r\nlower part of this section shows chiefly the banded structure already\r\ndescribed, the layers of different consistency being etched out by the\r\nweather in such a way as to give them the look of stratified rocks.\r\nIn the upper part of the precipice columnar and jointed or prismatic\r\nsheets are more common, but the most prominent band is the great sill,\r\nto which further reference will be made in the next Chapter.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the gradual retreat of the cliff, as the waves tunnel\r\nits base, and slice after slice is detached from its vertical front,\r\na group of at least five small vents has been uncovered lying along a\r\nnearly north and south line. Of two of these a segment remains still\r\non the cliff-wall and passes under the basalts; the others have been\r\ndissected and half cut away from the cliff, while groups of stacks and\r\nrocky islets of agglomerate may mark the position of others almost\r\neffaced. The horizontal distance within which the vents are crowded\r\nis probably less than half a mile, but the lofty proportions of the\r\nprecipice tend to lead the eye to underestimate both heights and\r\ndistances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 311.--Section of the same Neck as that shown in\r\nFig. 310.]\r\n\r\nThe agglomerate is a thoroughly volcanic rock, consisting of large and\r\nsmall blocks of various basalts, among which large slags are specially\r\nconspicuous, the whole being wrapped in a granular matrix of comminuted\r\nvolcanic detritus. The arrangement of this material is best seen in the\r\nfourth vent (Figs. 310 and 311). In this characteristic volcanic neck\r\n(_b_ in Fig. 311) the boundary walls, as laid bare on the face of the\r\nprecipice, are vertical, and are formed of the truncated ends of the\r\nbanded lavas (_a_ _a_) which have been blown out at the time of the\r\nformation of the orifice. The visible diameter of the vent was roughly\r\nestimated by me to be about 100 yards. No appreciable alteration was\r\nobserved in the ends of the lavas next the vent.\r\n\r\nThe agglomerate is coarsest in the centre, where huge blocks of\r\nslaggy lava lie imbedded in the amorphous mass of compacted debris.\r\nOn either side of this structureless central portion the agglomerate\r\nis distinctly stratified from the walls towards the middle, at angles\r\nof 30° to 35°. Even from a distance it can be observed that the upper\r\nlimit of the agglomerate is saucer-shaped, the sloping sides of the\r\ndepression dipping towards the centre of the neck at about the same\r\nangle as the rudely-stratified agglomerate underneath. From the bottom\r\nof this basin to the sea-level may be a vertical distance of some 30\r\nyards. The basin itself has been filled up by three successive flows\r\nof basalt, of which the first (_c_) has merely overflowed the bottom,\r\nthe second (_d_), entering from the northern rim of the basin, extends\r\nacross to the southern slope, while the third (_e_), also flowing from\r\nthe north, has filled up the remainder of the hollow and extended\r\ncompletely across it. The next succeeding lava (_f_) stretched over the\r\nsite in such a way as to bury it entirely, and to provide a level floor\r\nfor the piling up of the succeeding sheets of basalt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 312.--Volcanic Neck close to that shown in Figs.\r\n310 and 311.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 313.--Section of wall of another Neck of agglomerate in the\r\n  same group with those represented in Figs. 310, 311, and 312.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe second vent, which is represented in Fig 312, exhibits the same\r\nfeatures, but with some additional points of interest. It measures\r\nroughly about 20 yards in diameter at the sea-level, rises through the\r\nsame group of banded basalt (_a_ _a_), and is filled with a similar\r\nagglomerate (_b_). Its more northerly wall is now coincident with a\r\nline of fault (_h_) which ascends the cliff, and probably marks some\r\nsubsidence after the eruptions had ceased. The southern wall shows\r\nthat a dyke of basalt (_g_) has risen between the agglomerate and the\r\nbanded basalts, and that a second dyke (_g´_) traverses the latter at\r\na distance of a few feet. In this instance, also, the upper surface of\r\nthe agglomerate forms a cup-shaped depression which has been filled\r\nin by two successive streams of lava (_c_, _d_). Among the succeeding\r\nlavas (_e_) the prominent sill (_f_) has been intruded, to which\r\nfurther allusion is made on p. 323.\r\n\r\nThese necks are obviously volcanic vents belonging to the time of the\r\nbasaltic eruptions. They have been drilled through the basalts of\r\nthe lower part of the cliff, but have been buried under those of the\r\ncentral and higher parts. The arrangement of their component materials\r\nin rude beds dipping towards the middle of each vent shows that the\r\nejected dust and stones must have fallen back into the orifice so as\r\nto be rudely stratified towards the centre of the chimney, which was\r\nfinally closed by its own last discharges of coarse detritus. The\r\nsaucer-shaped upper limit of the agglomerate seems to indicate, as has\r\nbeen suggested above in the case of the Portree volcano, that after\r\nthe eruptions ceased each vent remained as a hollow or _maar_ on the\r\nsurface of the lava-fields. And the manner in which they are filled\r\nwith successive sheets of basalt shows that in course of time other\r\neruptions from neighbouring orifices gave forth streams of lava which,\r\nin flowing over the volcanic fields, eventually buried and obliterated\r\neach of the vents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TO ACCOMPANY SIR ARCHIBALD GEIKIE'S \"ANCIENT VOLCANOES\r\nOF BRITAIN\"\r\n\r\nMap VI MAP OF THE TERTIARY VOLCANIC REGION OF THE INNER HEBRIDES\r\n\r\nThe Edinburgh Geographical Institute Copyright J. G. Bartholomew]\r\n\r\nIn the destruction of the precipice some of the vents have been so much\r\ncut away that only a small part of the wall is left, with a portion of\r\nthe agglomerate adhering to it. The third neck, for instance, affords\r\nthe section represented in Fig. 313, where the horizontal sheets of\r\nbasalt (_a_) have still a kind of thick pellicle of the volcanic\r\ndetritus (_b_) adhering to what must have been part of the side of the\r\norifice of eruption. The waves have cut out a cave at the base, so that\r\nwe can, by boat, get behind the agglomerate and see the margin of the\r\nvolcanic funnel in the roof overhead.\r\n\r\nThe fragment of geological history so picturesquely laid bare on the\r\nStromö cliffs presents a significant illustration of what seems to\r\nhave been a frequent, if not the normal type of volcanic vent in the\r\nTertiary basalt-plateaux. By the fortunate accident that denudation has\r\nnot proceeded too far, we are able to observe the original tops of at\r\nleast two of the vents, and to see how such volcanic orifices, which\r\nwere doubtless abundant all over these plateaux, came to be entombed\r\nunder the ever-increasing pile of accumulating basalt.\r\n\r\nThere is still one feature of interest in these cliff-sections which\r\ndeserves notice here. Every geologist who has studied the composition\r\nof the basalt-plateaux has remarked the comparatively insignificant\r\npart played by tuffs in these volcanic accumulations. Hundreds of\r\nfeet of successive basalt-sheets may often be examined without the\r\ndiscovery of any intercalation of fragmental materials, and even where\r\nsuch intercalations do occur they are for the most part quite thin and\r\nextremely local. I found it impossible to scale the precipice for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining whether around the Stromö vents, and connected\r\nwith them, there might not be some beds of tuff interstratified between\r\nthe basalts. If such beds exist, they can only be of trifling thickness\r\nand extent. Here, then, are examples of once active vents, the funnels\r\nof which are still choked up with coarse fragmentary ejections, yet\r\nfrom which little or no discharge of ashes and stones took place over\r\nthe surrounding ground. They seem to have been left as crater-like\r\nhollows on the bare surface of the lava-fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\n                THE BASIC SILLS OF THE BASALT-PLATEAUX\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now followed the distribution of the basalt-plateaux, the\r\narrangement of their component materials which were erupted at the\r\nsurface, and the character of the dyke-fissures and vents from which\r\nthese materials were ejected. But there remains to be considered\r\nan extensive series of rocks which display some of the underground\r\nphenomena of the Tertiary volcanoes. The injection of many basaltic\r\nsheets had been clearly enforced by Macculloch. In 1871 I pointed out\r\nthat at different horizons in the plateau-basalts, but especially at\r\ntheir base and among the stratified rocks underneath them, sheets\r\nof basalt and dolerite occur which, though lying parallel with the\r\nstratification of the volcanic series, are not truly bedded, but\r\nintrusive, and therefore younger than the rocks between which they\r\nlie.[309] The non-recognition of their true nature had led to their being\r\nregarded as proofs of volcanic intercalations in the Jurassic series of\r\nScotland. There is, however, no trace of the true interstratification\r\nof a volcanic band in that series, every apparent example being due\r\nto the way in which intrusive sheets simulate the characters of\r\ncontemporaneous flows.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 309: _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ xxvii. (1871), p. 296.]\r\n\r\nIf such sheets had been met with only at one or two localities, we\r\nmight regard them as due to some mere local accident of structure in\r\nthe overlying crust through which the erupted material had to make its\r\nway. But when we find them everywhere from the cliffs of Antrim to\r\nthe far headlands of Skye and the Shiant Isles, and see them reappear\r\namong the Faroe Islands, it is obvious that, like those of Palæozoic\r\ntime, they must be due to some general cause, and that they contain the\r\nrecord of a special period or phase in the building up of the Tertiary\r\nvolcanic tablelands. I will first describe some typical examples\r\nof them from different districts, and then discuss their probable\r\nrelations with the other portions of the plateaux.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. ANTRIM\r\n\r\nFirst to be examined, and now most familiar to geologists, are the\r\nremarkable sheets that underlie the plateau of Antrim, and project at\r\nvarious parts of the picturesque line of coast between Portrush and\r\nFair Head. From the shore at Portrush, as I have already remarked,\r\ncame the evidence that was supposed to prove basalt to be a rock of\r\naqueous origin, inasmuch as shells were obtained there from what was\r\nbelieved to be basalt. The long controversy to which this supposed\r\ndiscovery gave rise is one of the most curious in the history of\r\ngeology.[310] It continued even after the illustrious Playfair had shown\r\nthat the pretended basalt was in reality highly indurated shale, and\r\nhence that, instead of furnishing proof of the aqueous formation\r\nof basalt, the Portrush sections only contributed another strong\r\nconfirmation of the Huttonian theory, which claimed basalt to be a rock\r\nof igneous origin.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 310: For an excellent summary of this controversy and an\r\nepitome of the descriptions of the Portrush section, see the _Report\r\non the Geology of Londonderry_, etc. (_Mem. Geol. Survey_), by J. E.\r\nPortlock (1843), p. 37.]\r\n\r\nIt is now well known that the rock which yielded the fossils is a\r\nLiassic shale, that it is traversed by several sheets of eruptive rock,\r\nand that by contact-metamorphism it has been changed into a highly\r\nindurated substance, breaking with a splintery, conchoidal fracture,\r\nbut still retaining its ammonites and other fossils. The eruptive\r\nmaterial is a coarse, distinctly crystalline dolerite, in some parts of\r\nwhich the augite, penetrated by lath-shaped crystals of plagioclase, is\r\nremarkably fresh, while the olivine has begun to show the serpentinous\r\nchange along its cracks.[311] This rock has been thrust between the\r\nbedding planes of the shales, but also breaks across them, and occurs\r\nin several sheets, though these may all be portions of one subterranean\r\nmass. Some of the sheets are only a few inches thick, and might at\r\nfirst be mistaken for sedimentary alternations in the shale. But their\r\nmode of weathering soon enables the observer readily to distinguish\r\nthem. It is to be noticed that these thin layers of eruptive material\r\nassume a fine grain, and resemble the ordinary dykes of the district.\r\nThis closeness of texture, as Griffith long ago pointed out,[312] is\r\nalso to be noticed along the marginal portions of the thicker sheets\r\nwhere they lie upon or are covered by the shales. But away from the\r\nsurfaces of contact, the rock assumes a coarser grain, insomuch that\r\nin its thickest mass it presents crystals measuring sometimes an inch\r\nin length, and then externally resembles a gabbro. A more curious\r\nstructure is shown in one of these coarsely crystalline portions by the\r\noccurrence of a band a few inches broad which is strongly amygdaloidal,\r\nthe cells, sometimes three inches or more in diameter, being filled\r\nwith zeolites.[313] The general dip of the shales and of the intrusive\r\nsheets which have been injected between them is towards the east. From\r\nunderneath them a thick mass of dolerite rises up to form the long\r\npromontory that here projects northwards from the coast-line, and is\r\nprolonged seawards in the chain of the Skerries.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 311: Dr. F. Hatch, Explanation of Sheets 7 and 8, _Geol. Survey\r\nof Ireland_, p. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 312: \"Address to Geological Society of Dublin, 1835,\" p. 13,\r\n_Jour. Geol. Soc. Dublin_, vol. i. The varieties of the Portrush rock\r\nwere described by the late Dr. Oldham, in Portlock's _Report on the\r\nGeology of Londonderry_, p. 150; see also the same work for Portlock's\r\nown remarks, p. 97.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 313: For a list of the minerals in this rock, see Oldham, _op.\r\ncit._ p. 151.]\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature of the Portrush sections is the clear way\r\nin which they exhibit the phenomena of \"segregation-veins\"--so\r\ncharacteristic of the thicker and more coarsely crystalline sills.\r\nThese veins or seams here differ from the rest of the rock mainly in\r\nthe much larger size and more definitely crystalline form of their\r\ncomponent minerals. Though sharply defined, when looked at from a\r\nlittle distance, they are found on closer inspection to shade into the\r\nsurrounding rock by a complete interlacing of crystals. On the shore,\r\nthey can be seen to lie, on the whole, parallel with the bedding of\r\nthe sheets in which they occur, but without rigidly following it,\r\nsince they undulate and even ramify. A good section across their dip\r\nhas been exposed in a quarry near the end of the promontory, and shows\r\nthat they are considerably less regular than the plan of their outcrop\r\non the shore would have led us to anticipate. The accompanying drawing\r\n(Fig. 314) represents the veins laid bare on a face of rock nine feet\r\nin length by five feet in height. It will be seen that while there is a\r\ngeneral tendency to conform to the dip-slope, which is here from right\r\nto left, the seams or layers unite into a large rudely-bedded mass,\r\nwhich sends out processes at different angles. The peculiar aggregation\r\nof minerals which distinguishes such veins is perhaps best seen at Fair\r\nHead, and I reserve for the description of that locality what I have\r\nto say on the subject, only remarking with regard to the Portrush rock\r\nthat the felspar shows a disposition to collect in the centre of the\r\nveins with the augite and the other dark minerals at the outer margins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 314.--View of \"Segregation-Veins\" in a dolerite\r\nsill, Portrush, Antrim.]\r\n\r\nThe contact-metamorphism at this locality is of more historical\r\ninterest in connection with the progress of geological theory than of\r\nscientific importance. It consists mainly in an intense induration of\r\nthe argillaceous strata. These pass here from their usual condition of\r\nfissile, laminar, dull, dark shales into an exceedingly compact, black,\r\nflinty substance, which in its fracture, colour and hardness reminds\r\none of Lydian stone. Yet the ammonites and other organic remains have\r\nnot been destroyed. They are preserved in pyrites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 315.--View of Fair Head, from the east, showing the\r\nmain upper sill and a thinner sheet cropping out along the talus slope.]\r\n\r\nOf all the examples of Tertiary sills in Britain few are more imposing\r\nthan that of the noble range of precipices which form the promontory\r\nof Fair Head. Leaving out of account the minor masses of eruptive rock\r\nwhich occur underneath it, we find the main sheet to extend along the\r\ncoast for nearly four miles, to rise to a height of 636 feet above the\r\nsea, and to attain a maximum thickness of 250 feet. This enormous bed\r\ndies out rapidly both to the east and west, and seems also to thin away\r\ninland. Seen from the north, it stands upon a talus of blocks as a\r\nsheer vertical wall, 250 feet high, and the rude prisms into which it\r\nis divided are continuous from top to bottom (Fig. 315). So regular is\r\nthis prismatic structure, and so much does it recall the more minute\r\ncolumnar grouping of the bedded basalts, that at a little distance we\r\ncan hardly realize the true scale of the structure. It is only when\r\nwe stand at the base of the cliff or scramble down its one accessible\r\ngully, the \"Grey Man's Path,\" that we appreciate how long and thick\r\neach of the prisms actually is (Fig. 316). It may here be remarked\r\nthat this regular prismatic jointing is one of the distinguishing\r\nfeatures of the large sills, and serves to mark them off from the\r\nbedded basalts, even when these have assumed a columnar structure. The\r\nprisms are much larger than the basalt-columns, and never display the\r\nirregular starch-like arrangement so common among the plateau-basalts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 316.--View of Fair Head from the shore. (From a\r\nPhotograph by Mr. R. Welch.)]\r\n\r\nThe rock composing this magnificent sheet is a coarsely crystalline,\r\nophitic, olivine-dolerite.[314] The same diminution of the component\r\ncrystals, which is so marked along the margins of the eruptive masses\r\nat Portrush, is strikingly exhibited at the borders of the Fair Head\r\nsill. For about 18 or 20 inches upward from the bottom, where the\r\nbed rests on the black, Carboniferous shales, the dolerite is dark\r\nand finely crystalline, weathering spheroidally in the usual manner.\r\nBut immediately above that bottom layer of closer grain, the normal\r\ncoarsely crystalline texture rapidly supervenes. A similar closeness of\r\ngrain is observable at the surfaces of contact where the sheet splits\r\nup on its western border.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 314: Professor Judd has described what he calls a\r\n\"glomero-porphyritic structure\" in this rock (_Quart. Journ. Geol.\r\nSoc._ xlii. (1886), p. 71).]\r\n\r\nNowhere, so far as I know, can the phenomena of \"segregation-veins\"\r\nbe so instructively studied as along the abundant exposures of this\r\ngreat sheet. The veins are most conspicuous where the rock occurs\r\nin thickest mass. They vary up to three or four feet in thickness,\r\nand, as at Portrush and elsewhere, lie on the whole parallel to the\r\nupper and under surfaces of the sheet. An erroneous impression may be\r\nconveyed by the term \"veins\" applied to them. They are quite as much\r\nlayers, parallel on the whole with the bedding of the sheet, yet not\r\nadhering rigidly to one plane, but passing across here and there from\r\none horizon to another. That they are not due to any long subsequent\r\nprotrusion of younger material through the main sheet is made manifest\r\nby the thorough interlocking of their component crystals with those\r\nof the body of the rock in which they lie. The material that fills\r\nthese veins has obviously been introduced into them while there was\r\nstill some freedom of movement among the crystals of the surrounding\r\nrock, which must thus have been still not quite consolidated and\r\ntherefore intensely hot. Both crystallized slowly, and in so doing\r\ntheir component minerals dovetailed with each other. The constituents\r\nof the veins consist of an exceedingly coarse aggregate of crystals, or\r\nrather of crystalline lumps of the same minerals that constitute the\r\ngeneral mass of the rock, the felspar and augite showing the ophitic\r\nintergrowth of the main rock, but on a far larger scale. Some of the\r\npieces of augite measure two inches or more in diameter. The conditions\r\nunder which these veins were produced must have differed in some\r\nessential respects from those that prevailed during the formation of\r\nthe fine-grained, highly siliceous veins already described as occurring\r\nin some dykes and sills.\r\n\r\nThis great Fair Head sill lies upon Carboniferous strata, but that\r\nit is to be classed with the Tertiary volcanic series is, I think,\r\ndemonstrated by its relations to the Chalk at its eastern end. It has\r\nthere broken through that rock, and converted it for a short distance\r\ninto a white, granular marble. But it is at the western side that the\r\nmost interesting sections occur to show the truly intrusive nature of\r\nthe mass. The rock there splits up into about a dozen sheets, which,\r\nkeeping generally parallel with each other, have forced their way\r\nbetween and partly across the bedding planes of the Carboniferous\r\nshales (Fig. 317). In this way the huge, unbroken mass, 250 feet thick,\r\nsubdivides itself and disappears in a few hundred yards, though it\r\ncontinues a little further inland, and approaches the shore again half\r\na mile to the south-west. Further evidence of the intrusive nature of\r\nthis rock may be observed along the base of the precipice, where at\r\nleast one sheet 70 feet thick diverges from the main mass and runs\r\neastwards between the Carboniferous shales (Fig. 315). At the contact\r\nwith the eruptive rock the shales are everywhere much indurated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 317.--Section at Farragandoo Cliff, west end of\r\nFair Head, showing the rapid splitting up and dying out of an Intrusive\r\nSheet.\r\n\r\n_a_, Carboniferous sandstone; _b_, Carboniferous shale; _c_, intrusive\r\nsheet.]\r\n\r\n\r\nii. SKYE\r\n\r\nAll through the Inner Hebrides the base of the basalt-plateaux presents\r\nabundant examples of sills. The general parallelism of these intrusive\r\nsheets to the bedding of the Jurassic strata among which they lie has\r\nbeen above referred to as having given rise to the erroneous conclusion\r\nthat in Skye and elsewhere the basalts are interstratified with\r\nJurassic rocks, and are consequently of Jurassic age. It was Macculloch\r\nwho first described and figured in detail the proofs of their intrusive\r\nnature. His well-known sections in plate xvii. of the illustrations to\r\nhis work on the _Western Islands_ have been repeatedly copied, and have\r\nserved as typical figures of intrusive igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nNowhere in North-Western Europe can the phenomena of sills be studied\r\nso fully and with such exuberance and variety of detail as in the\r\nisland of Skye and its surrounding islets. On the western coast the\r\ngreater subsidence of the basaltic plateau has for the most part\r\nsubmerged the platform of intrusive sheets, though wherever the base\r\nof the bedded lavas is brought up to the surface the accompanying\r\nsills are exposed to view. The east coast of the island has been\r\nclassic ground for this part of volcanic geology since it supplied the\r\nmaterials for Macculloch's descriptions and diagrams. From the mouth of\r\nLoch Sligachan to Rudha Hunish, at the north end of Skye, a series of\r\nsills may be traced, sometimes crowning the cliffs as a columnar mural\r\nescarpment, sometimes burrowing in endless veins and threads through\r\nthe Jurassic rocks. The horizontal distance to which this continuous\r\nband of sills extends in Skye is not far short of 30 miles. But it\r\nstretches beyond the limits of the island. It forms the group of islets\r\nwhich prolongs the geological structure and topographical features of\r\nTrotternish for 4 miles further to the north-west. It reappears 10\r\nmiles still further on in the Shiant Isles. Thus its total visible\r\nlength is fully 40 miles, or if we include some outlying sills near the\r\nPoint of Sleat, to be afterwards described, it extends over a distance\r\nof not less than 60 miles. From the last outlier in Skye to the sills\r\nof the Isle of Eigg is a distance of only 8 miles, thence to those\r\nof Ardnamurchan 17 miles, and to those of the south coast of Mull 25\r\nmiles. Thus this platform of intrusive sheets of the Inner Hebrides can\r\nbe interruptedly followed for a space of not less than 110 miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 318.--View of the Trotternish Coast, showing the\r\nposition of the band of Sills.\r\n\r\nThe dark band crowning the first slope above sea-level marks a\r\nconspicuous band of sills which towards the right descends to the\r\nbeach and is prolonged seaward in the group of islands. The Storr Rock\r\nappears as a slanting obelisk of rock on the hill to the left.]\r\n\r\nThough none of the sills in Skye itself attain the dimensions of\r\nthe Fair Head sheet, they present a greater variety of rock and of\r\ngeological structure than is to be found in Antrim. They are specially\r\ndeveloped at the base of the thick, overlying, basalt-plateau--a\r\nplatform on which such a prodigious quantity of eruptive material\r\nhas been injected. Part of this material consists of basic rocks in\r\nthe form of dykes, veins, or sills; part of it is included in the\r\nintermediate and acid groups, and comprises veins, sheets, and bosses\r\nof granitoid, felsitic, rhyolitic, trachytic, and pitchstone rocks.\r\nOne of the peculiarities of the Skye sills is the occurrence among\r\nthem of compound examples, where sheets of basic and acid material\r\nhave been injected along the same general platform. These will be more\r\nspecially referred to in Chapter xlviii. With regard to the basic\r\nsills (dolerites, basalts, etc.), I would remark that while in Western\r\nScotland the Antrim type of short, thick intrusions, or laccolites,\r\nis also found, the vast majority of the sheets are much thinner, more\r\npersistent, and less easily distinguishable from the bedded basalts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 319.--Columnar Sill intrusive in Jurassic Strata\r\neast of Kilmartin, Trotternish, Skye.\r\n\r\n[The high ground to the left is a portion of the basalt-plateau to the\r\nnorth of the well-known Quiraing.]]\r\n\r\nIn describing the sills of Skye I shall take first those of the eastern\r\nand then those of the western side of the island. Along the east coast,\r\nfrom Loch Sligachan to the most northerly headlands and islets the\r\nsills play a notable part in the scenery, inasmuch as they cap the\r\ngreat sea-cliff of Trotternish and run as a line of ridges parallel\r\nto the trend of the coast, while the plateau-basalts rise above them\r\nfurther inland as a lofty escarpment, which includes the picturesque\r\nlandslips of the Storr Rock and Quiraing (Figs. 318, 319). Beneath\r\nthe thick sills, the Jurassic sandstones form a range of pale yellow\r\nprecipices, along which many thinner sheets of eruptive material have\r\nbeen intruded. As Macculloch well showed, many of these sheets, if seen\r\nonly at one point, might readily be taken for regularly interstratified\r\nbeds, but perhaps only a few yards distant they may be found to break\r\nacross the strata and to resume their course on a different level.\r\n\r\nThe sills of this Trotternish coast may be distinguished even at some\r\ndistance from the bedded basalts by the regular prismatic jointing,\r\nalready referred to, and by their frequently greater thickness, while\r\non closer inspection they are characterized by their much coarser\r\ntexture. They are generally somewhat largely crystalline ophitic\r\ndolerites, gabbros or diabases, and exhibit the persistent uniformity\r\nof composition and structure so characteristic of intrusive sheets and\r\ndykes. These characters are well exhibited in the Kilt Rock, a columnar\r\nsill capping the cliffs to the south of Loch Staffin (Fig. 319).\r\n\r\nThese massive sills are prolonged in a series of picturesque flat\r\ntabular islets beyond the most northerly headlands of Skye. They\r\nprobably continue northwards under the sea at least 12 miles further,\r\nfor sills of the same type rise there in the singularly striking group\r\nof the Shiant Isles (Fig. 320). These lonely islets, extending in\r\nan east and west direction for about three miles, display in great\r\nperfection most of the chief characters of the Skye sills. They are\r\nespecially noteworthy for including the thickest intrusive sheet and\r\nthe noblest columnar cliff in the whole of the Tertiary volcanic series\r\nof Britain. The larger of the two chief islands consists of two masses\r\nof rock connected by a strip of shingle-beach, and having a united\r\nlength from north to south of about two miles. The northern half, or\r\nGarbh Eilean, presents towards the north a sheer precipice 500 feet\r\nhigh. This magnificent face of rock consists of one single sill, but as\r\nits original upper limit has been removed by denudation and its base,\r\nwhere it is thickest, is concealed under the sea, the sill may exceed\r\n500 feet in thickness. The rock has the usual prismatic structure,\r\nwhich imparts to it an impressive appearance of regularity. The columns\r\nretain their individuality to a great height, and though none of them\r\nperhaps can be followed from base to crest of the cliff, many of them\r\nare evidently at least 300 or 400 feet long.\r\n\r\nMacculloch, who gave the first geological description of the Shiant\r\nIsles, showed the intrusive nature of the igneous rocks, and described\r\nthe remarkable globular or botryoidal structure of the Jurassic\r\nshales between which they have been injected.[315] Professor Heddle has\r\npublished a brief account of the geology of the islands.[316] Professor\r\nJudd visited the group and brought away a series of specimens of\r\ntheir eruptive rocks, which he found to include basic and ultra-basic\r\nvarieties.[317]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 315: _Western Islands_, vol. i. p. 441.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 316: _Trans. Norfolk Nat. Hist. Soc._ vol. iii. (1880) p. 61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 317: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xxxiv. (1878) p. 677, and\r\nxli. (1885) p. 393. My description in the text is the result of three\r\nsuccessive visits to the islands.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 320.--View of the northern precipice (500 feet\r\nhigh) of the largest of the Shiant Isles.\r\n\r\n(From a Photograph by Colonel Evans.)]\r\n\r\nIn Garbh Eilean, where the thickest mass of erupted material presents\r\nitself, at least three sills may be observed. Some low reefs that\r\nrun parallel with the northern coast of the island consist of coarse\r\nophitic gabbro in two or more sheets which have been intruded between\r\nthe Jurassic shales. Above these strata comes the great columnar sill,\r\nits base gradually sinking towards the west until it passes under the\r\nsea, and the vertical columns then plunge abruptly into the water.\r\nThe rock of which this massive sill consists is another large-grained\r\ngabbro or dolerite, with an ophitic structure. Owing to the form of\r\nthe ground it cannot be so satisfactorily examined as the neighbouring\r\nisland of Eilean Mhuire, which, though less lofty and rather smaller\r\nthan Garbh Eilean, affords a succession of admirable and easily\r\nexamined sections along its precipitous shores.\r\n\r\nProfessor Judd found that while the rocks are mainly ophitic gabbros\r\nand dolerites, they include such highly basic compounds as dunite.\r\nAn examination of the Eilean Mhuire cliffs enables the observer to\r\nascertain that the sills display considerable variety in texture and\r\nin the character and arrangement of their component minerals. They\r\nare marked by a persistent, more or less distinct disposition in rude\r\nbeds, and these again often display a banding of their constituents\r\nin lines parallel with the general bedding. Some of these bands are\r\nlargely felspathic, and are thus paler in colour. Others, where the\r\nferro-magnesian minerals and ores are more specially aggregated, are\r\ndark in colour. In some layers the long black prisms of augite are\r\nranged in a general parallelism with the banding.\r\n\r\nA specimen selected as typical of the ordinary coarse-grained amorphous\r\nrock was sliced and placed in Mr. Harker's for microscopic examination,\r\nand he has supplied the following observations regarding it: \"The\r\ngabbro from Eilean Mhuire [7110] is a crystalline rock showing to the\r\neye lustrous black augites, half an inch long, and (predominating)\r\nfelspar. The microscope reveals, in addition, irregular grains of black\r\niron-ore and little hexagonal prisms of apatite. No olivine is to be\r\ndetected. As regards structure, the augite has tended to crystallise\r\nout in advance of the felspar, but this relation is not constant.\r\n\r\n\"The augite is of a light-brown tint in slices, and has an unusual\r\nkind of pleochroism. The colour for vibrations parallel to the [Greek:\r\nb]-axis is of the purplish-brown tone seen in some soda-bearing\r\naugites; parallel to [Greek: g] and [Greek: a] it has a yellow or\r\ncitron tint. The colour and pleochroism are more marked in the\r\ninterior of a crystal than towards the margin, but some crystals\r\npass at the margin into a slightly pleochroic, pale-green, recalling\r\nægerine-augite. The felspar tends to build elongated crystals. It is a\r\nrather finely lamellated labradorite, sometimes showing pericline- as\r\nwell as albite-lamellae.\"\r\n\r\nAnother specimen from one of the black bands in the same island, with a\r\nlinear arrangement of its component minerals, is thus described by the\r\nsame petrographer: \"This rock [7111] is of darker appearance than the\r\npreceding, and contains abundant black iron-ore, besides some pyrites.\r\nIt also differs in having a marked parallel disposition of its crystals.\r\n\r\n\"Except for the greater prominence of large irregular grains of\r\niron-ore, this rock under the microscope closely resembles the last\r\ndescribed, the parallel structure not being conspicuous in the slice.\r\nThe augite has the peculiar colour and pleochroism already noted, and\r\nthe felspar is of the same kind as before.\"\r\n\r\nI did not succeed in finding in place any bands of dunite, but this\r\nbasic material probably occurs at the base of some of the sills where\r\nit has segregated from the rest of the mass, like the picrite at the\r\nbottom of the Bathgate diabase.\r\n\r\nThe amount of contact-metamorphism effected even by such thick sills as\r\nthose of Trotternish and Shiant is much less than might be expected.\r\nIt seldom goes beyond a mere induration of the strata for a few yards,\r\noften only for a few inches from the surface of junction. In the Shiant\r\nIsles, however, the shales between the sills have undergone a more\r\nremarkable alteration. They have not only been greatly indurated, but\r\nhave acquired the globular or botryoidal structure so fully described\r\nby Macculloch. The spheroidal aggregates vary from not more than a\r\nline to more than half an inch in diameter, and appear on the surface\r\nas dark, irregularly grouped, pea-like aggregates. This structure is\r\nperhaps best developed immediately under the thick sill on the west\r\nside of Eilean Mhuire.\r\n\r\nThe massive sills are not the only evidence of the injection of igneous\r\nmaterial on the Shiant Isles. The sill, or more probably group of\r\nsills, forming Eilean Mhuire is traversed by a number of sheets of\r\nbasalt varying from only two or three inches to 20 feet in thickness.\r\nThese black fine-grained rocks invariably present chilled selvages next\r\nthe coarse gabbro, and though they have been on the whole injected\r\nparallel to the general bedding or banding, they here and there break\r\nacross it as veins. The most important of these later intrusions forms\r\na columnar sill on the eastern side of the island, and can be followed\r\nfor several hundred yards. It consists of a dark finely crystalline\r\nolivine-basalt, which towards the margin assumes a dense black texture.\r\nUnder the microscope Mr. Harker found a thin slice of this rock to\r\nbe \"an olivine-basalt of semi-ophitic, semi-granulitic structure\r\n[7112]. The olivine is mostly fresh, but part of it is converted\r\ninto a yellowish-brown pseudomorph like iddingsite. Magnetite occurs\r\nchiefly in imperfect octohedra. The felspar is in little lath-shaped\r\nsections, many of which are finely striated, and give extinction-angles\r\nindicating a labradorite. The augite, light brown in the slice, never\r\nhas crystal-boundaries, and often enwraps the felspars.\"\r\n\r\nThe narrow veins are composed of a much closer-grained basalt in which\r\na few scattered felspars are visible. Mr. Harker remarks, with regard\r\nto a thin slice of one of these rocks [7113], that \"the microscope\r\nshows this, too, to be an olivine-basalt. The porphyritic felspars\r\nare twinned on the Carlsbad and albite laws. Olivine and pseudomorphs\r\nafter it are well represented. Magnetite is only sparingly present.\r\nThe general mass of the rock consists of very small striated prisms of\r\nlabradorite, granules of augite, and interstitial matter which must be\r\npartly glassy.\"\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps the most striking of all the examples known to me where\r\nan older sill has been split open to receive a subsequent injection of\r\nmolten material. The Eilean Mhuire gabbro must be at least 200 feet\r\nthick, and it not impossibly passes under the still thicker pile of\r\nGarbh Eilean. Yet it has been horizontally ruptured near its base, and\r\ninto the rent thus produced another mass of molten matter has been\r\nthrust. This subject will be again referred to in connection with\r\nanother remarkable example on the west coast of Skye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 321.--Section of thin Intrusive Sheets and Veins in\r\ncarbonaceous shales lying among the Plateau-basalts, cliffs north of\r\nAch na Hannait, between Portree Bay and Lock Sligachan.]\r\n\r\nIn contrast to such enormous thicknesses of intrusive material as those\r\nof Trotternish and the Shiant Isles, instances may be culled from the\r\nsame belt of sills where the molten rock has been injected in thin\r\nleaves and mere threads into the Jurassic sandstones and shales, or\r\ninto the shales and coals intercalated among the plateau-basalts. Thus,\r\non the cliff immediately to the north of Ach na Hannait, between Loch\r\nSligachan and Portree Bay, the section may be seen which is represented\r\nin Fig. 321. At the base lies a vesicular dolerite with a slaggy upper\r\nsurface (_a_). Next comes a zone of sedimentary material about five\r\nor six feet thick, the lower portion consisting of an impure coal,\r\nwhich passes towards the right hand into brown and grey carbonaceous\r\nshale with plant-remains (_b_). This coaly layer has been already\r\nalluded to as probably lying on the same horizon with the coal of\r\nPortree (p. 288). Traced northward, it is found to have a bed of fine\r\ntuff beneath it, and sometimes a volcanic breccia or conglomerate.\r\nIt fills up rents in the underlying slaggy lava, and was undoubtedly\r\ndeposited upon the cooled surface of that rock. Immediately above this\r\nlower band the black carbonaceous shale which follows has been invaded\r\nby an extraordinary number of thin cakes or sills and also by veins\r\nor threads of basalt. For a thickness of two or three feet the band\r\n(_d_) consists mainly of these intrusions, which, in the form of a\r\nfine grey basalt, vary from less than an inch to three or four inches\r\nin thickness. They are separated by thin partings of coaly shale,\r\nand as they tend to break up into detached nodule-like portions,\r\nespecially towards the right hand of the section, they might, on casual\r\ninspection, be easily mistaken for nodules in the dark shales. Somewhat\r\nlater in the time of intrusion are veins of basalt which, as at _c_,\r\nbreak across the nodular sills, and sometimes expand into thicker beds\r\n(_c´_).\r\n\r\nI have never seen such a congeries of minute sills among the Tertiary\r\nbasalt-plateaux as that here exhibited. In a space of about three feet\r\nof vertical height there must be more than a dozen of roughly parallel\r\nleaves of intrusive rock. Veins (_e_) run up from the chief band of\r\neruptive material into the overlying finely vesicular basalt (_f_). The\r\ndyke (_g_) is probably the youngest rock in the section.\r\n\r\nThe more general and extensive submergence of the base of the\r\nbasalt-plateau on the west side of Skye has for the most part carried\r\nthe platform of sills below sea-level, so that it is only exceptionally\r\nwhere, owing to local irregularities, that base has been brought up to\r\nthe air, that the intrusive sheets show themselves. Yet the persistence\r\nof the platform on that side is indicated by its extension even as far\r\nas the southern promontory of the island.\r\n\r\nThe Trotternish type of sill extends down the west coast under the\r\nheadlands of Duirinish. Thus at the mouth of Dunvegan Loch, where the\r\nunderlying Jurassic platform has been ridged up above the surface of\r\nthe sea, it has carried with it the marked sill which forms the islets\r\nof Mingay and Clett that lie as a protecting breakwater across the\r\nentrance of the inlet. The intrusive rock rests on shell-limestones\r\nfull of oysters (_Ostrea hebridica_), and referable to the Loch\r\nStaffin group of the Great Oolite Series. This sill, when observed\r\nfrom a little distance, presents the usual regularly prismatic or\r\ncolumnar structure so well developed among the Trotternish examples,\r\nbut on a closer view shows this structure less distinctly. It is an\r\nolivine-dolerite of medium and fine texture, which in thin slices\r\ndisplays under the microscope a distinctly ophitic structure, the\r\nabundant light-brown augite enclosing the striated felspars. Its\r\nlowest portion, from three to seven or eight inches upward from the\r\nbottom, is much closer-textured than the rest of the rock and is finely\r\namygdaloidal. Its vesicles are in many cases drawn out to a length of\r\nthree or four inches, and the zeolites which now fill them look like\r\nparallel annelid tubes or stems of _Lithostrotion_. It is noteworthy\r\nalso that the elongation of the vesicles has sometimes taken place at\r\na right angle to the surface of contact with the underlying strata.\r\nBut the most remarkable feature in this sill is the surface which it\r\npresents to the oyster-beds on which it rests. The fine-grained dark\r\ndolerite has there assumed the aspect of a sheet of iron-slag, with a\r\nsmooth or wrinkled, twisted, ropy surface, which displays fine curving\r\nflow-lines. No one looking at a detached specimen of this surface would\r\nbe ready to admit that it could possibly have come from anything but\r\na true lava-stream that flowed out at the surface. The contours of a\r\nviscous lava are here precisely reproduced on the under surface of a\r\nmassive sill.\r\n\r\nA little further south, the promontory of Eist, forming the western\r\nbreakwater of Moonen Bay, consists of an important sill or group of\r\nsills which has insinuated itself among shales, shell-limestones, and\r\nshaly sandstones, full of _Ostrea hebridica_, _Cyrena aurata_, etc.,\r\nand belonging to the Loch Staffin group of the Great Oolite Series.\r\nThe shore-cliff below the waterfall affords the section given in Fig.\r\n322, illustrating the manner in which a thick intrusive sheet may\r\nsometimes give off thin veins from its mass. The rock attains on the\r\nEist promontory a thickness of probably at least 100 feet, where it\r\nis thickest and undivided. But the two main sheets, or branches of\r\none great sheet, on this peninsula have probably a united depth of\r\nmore than 300 feet. Landwards the rock splits up and encloses cakes\r\nof the Jurassic strata. It possesses the usual prismatic structure\r\nand doleritic composition. In Moonen Bay, as shown in Fig. 322, it\r\npresents a banded structure, marked especially by an alternation of\r\nlines of amygdales and layers of more compact and solid dolerite,\r\nwith occasional enclosed cakes of baked shale or sandstone. Its upper\r\nsurface is somewhat uneven, and from it are given off narrow, wavy,\r\nribbon-like veins (_d_), from less than an inch to three inches or\r\nmore in width, which keep in a general sense parallel to the top of\r\nthe sill, but at a distance of a few inches or feet from it. The sill\r\nbecomes as usual fine-grained towards the contact, the shales and\r\nsandstones being indurated and the limestone marmorized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 322.--Upper part of Sill, Moonen Bay, Waternish,\r\nSkye, showing the divergence of veins.\r\n\r\n_a_, false-bedded shaly sandstone; _b_, shell-limestone; _c_, dolerite\r\nsill; _d_, veins proceeding from the sill.\r\n\r\nLength of section about five yards.]\r\n\r\nThe next uprise of the base of the basalt-plateau on the west side of\r\nSkye lies about 25 miles to the south-east, where it emerges from the\r\nsea in the Sound of Soa (Fig. 323). A vast volcanic pile has there\r\nbeen heaped up on the Torridon sandstone, the whole of the thick\r\nJurassic series, which is found in force only three miles distant in\r\nStrathaird, having been removed by denudation from this area before the\r\nbeginning of the Tertiary volcanic period. The plateau-basalts rests on\r\nthe upturned edges of the Torridonian sandstones and shales, and are\r\naccompanied as usual by their underlying network of intrusive rocks. It\r\nis hardly possible to exaggerate the wild confusion of sills, dykes and\r\nveins which have been injected among the rocks, at and on both sides of\r\nthe unconformability. Endless sheets of basalt and dolerite have forced\r\ntheir way between the bedded basalts and the sandstones, while across\r\nthe whole rise vast numbers of dykes and veins. Narrow, black, wavy\r\nribbons of basic material cross many of these veins, while the later\r\nnorth-west dykes cut sharply through everything older than themselves.\r\nAs a natural section for the study of the phenomena of intrusion in\r\nmany of their most characteristic phases, I know no locality equal\r\nto the northern coast-line of the Sound of Soa, unless it be the\r\ncliffs of Ardnamurchan. But the Skye cliffs, though less imposing than\r\nthose of the great Argyllshire headland, have this advantage, that\r\ninstead of being exposed to the full roll of the open Atlantic, they\r\nform the margin of a comparatively sheltered strait, and can thus be\r\nconveniently examined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 323.--Section of the base of the Basalt-plateau\r\nwith sill and dykes, Sound of Soa, Skye.\r\n\r\n_a_ _a_, Torridon Sandstone; _b_, Bedded basalts; _c_, Sill; _d_ _d_,\r\nDykes.]\r\n\r\nFollowing still the western seaboard of Skye, we meet with other\r\nstriking examples of sills at a distance of some eight miles in a\r\nstraight line eastward where, between Lochs Slapin and Eishort, the\r\nprominent headland of Suisnish juts out into the sea. This promontory\r\nhas long been known to geologists from the section of it given by\r\nMacculloch as an instance of the connection between overlying rocks\r\nand dykes. I have already alluded to it in that relation, and refer\r\nto it again as an example of one of the thicker intrusive sheets of\r\nthe Inner Hebrides. Denudation has here also proceeded so far that\r\nthe whole of the volcanic plateau has been stripped off, only some of\r\nthe underlying sills being left, together with the platform of older\r\nrocks between which and the vanished basalts they were injected.\r\nMost of these sills consist of granophyres belonging to the acid\r\ngroup of rocks to be afterwards described. But basic sheets occur not\r\ninfrequently interposed between the granophyres and the subjacent Lias,\r\nand sometimes even intercalated in the former rock. Though at first\r\nsight it might be thought that these sills had insinuated themselves\r\nafter the eruption of the granophyre, and there are instances where\r\nthis cannot be shown not to be the case, I have obtained so many proofs\r\nof the invasion of the basic by the acid rock that I have no doubt the\r\nformer is, as a general rule, the older of the two.\r\n\r\nThe Suisnish headland exhibits the structure represented in Fig.\r\n249. For about 300 feet above the sea-level the steep grassy slope\r\nshows outcrops of the dark, sandy shales and yellowish brown, shaly\r\nsandstones of the Lias which form the range of cliffs to the eastward.\r\nThese gently inclined strata are cut through by many vertical\r\nbasalt-dykes, some of which intersect each other, but among which\r\nby far the largest is the mass shown in the figure. This broad dyke\r\nconsists of a dolerite or gabbro the largely crystalline texture of\r\nwhich marks it off at once from the others, which are of the usual\r\ndark, heavy, fine-grained type, with an occasional less basic and\r\nporphyritic variety. Traced up from the sea-margin, the dyke loses\r\nitself in a talus of blocks from the cliff above, so that its actual\r\njunction with the mural front of the sill cannot be seen. But that it\r\njoins that mass, with which it agrees in petrographical characters,\r\nhardly admits of question. The cliff consists of a thick sheet of\r\ncoarsely crystalline dolerite or gabbro (_d_ in Fig. 249), which in\r\nits general aspect at once recalls the rock of Fair Head. It varies\r\nconsiderably in texture, some parts of the mass are exceedingly coarse,\r\nlike the Skye gabbros, and present a fibrous structure in their augite\r\nresembling that of the diallage in these rocks; other portions assume\r\nthe compactness of basalt. A specimen of medium grain under the\r\nmicroscope shows the typical ophitic structure so generally found among\r\nthe dolerites both of the plateaux and of the intrusive sheets. This\r\nsill must be about 200 feet thick, and like the rock at Fair Head is\r\ntraversed from top to bottom by joints that divide it into prisms. It\r\nappears to bifurcate eastward, one portion running with a tolerably\r\nuniform thickness of a few feet as a prominent band at the top of\r\nthe shales and sandstones, the other slanting upwards and gradually\r\nthinning away in the granophyre.\r\n\r\nTowards its base, near the contact with the underlying shales, the rock\r\nas usual becomes finer grained, and the thin band just referred to\r\nresembles in texture one of the wider basalt-dykes. Westwards the rock\r\ncan be followed round the top of the grassy slopes formed by the decay\r\nof the shales. Though concealed by intervals of moorland and peat, it\r\nis visible in the stream sections, and I think must be continuous, as\r\na band only a few yards thick, round the northern side of the hills as\r\nfar as Beinn Bhuidhe, where a similar sill makes a prominent crag. Its\r\ntotal area measures a mile and a quarter in length by half a mile in\r\nbreadth. The granophyre which overlies it forms part of an interesting\r\nseries of sheets which I have traced all the way from Suisnish to the\r\nbraes above Skulamus.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the whole sheet of basic rock is continuous, and whether\r\nit all proceeded from the great Suisnish dyke, cannot be confidently\r\ndecided until the ground is mapped in detail, though from the great\r\nthickness of the sill at the dyke, its attenuation outwards from that\r\ncentre and its uniformity of petrographical character, I am disposed\r\nto answer affirmatively. There is no other probable vent to be seen\r\nin the neighbourhood, unless a massive dyke that runs from Loch Fada\r\nnorth-westwards into Glen Boreraig can be so regarded.\r\n\r\nNot far from the extreme southern point of Skye a singularly\r\ninteresting example of a sill remains as a detached survival of the\r\nbasaltic plateau and its accompaniments. In his map of Skye, Macculloch\r\nshowed the position of this outlier, which he classed with the\r\ngeneral \"trap\" formation of the island. The locality was visited by\r\nProfessor Judd, who regarded the intrusive rock as a \"phonolite\"[318]\r\nIn 1894, during an excursion with my colleague Mr. C. T. Clough, I had\r\nan opportunity of examining the rocks and collecting notes for the\r\nfollowing account of them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 318: _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ vol. xxxiv. (1878) p. 692.]\r\n\r\nAt Rudh' an Iasgaich, about two miles from the Point of Sleat, a small\r\noutlier of conglomerate lies on the edges of the Torridon Sandstone.\r\nThis deposit has been correctly identified by Professor Judd with\r\nthe similar strata which, in Skye and elsewhere on the west coast of\r\nScotland, underlie the Liassic series. It is here about 10 or 12 feet\r\nthick, reddish and yellowish in colour, and distinctly calcareous. Its\r\ncomponent pebbles consist largely of Cambrian (Durness) limestone,\r\nquartzite, and Torridon Sandstone--rocks which all occur _in situ_ in\r\nSleat. It may be compared with the limestone conglomerates of Strath\r\nand those which underlie the Lias at Heast on Loch Eishort.[319] That\r\nhere, as elsewhere in this region, the basement conglomerate was\r\nfollowed by the rest of the Lias and Oolites may be inferred with some\r\nconfidence from the copious development of the Jurassic series a few\r\nmiles off, both to north and south. But the whole of this overlying\r\nsuccession of formations has here been swept away, and, but for the\r\nprotection afforded by the eruptive rocks of Rudh' an Iasgaich, the\r\nconglomerate would likewise have disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 319: _Op. cit._ vol. xiv. (1857), p. 9; vol. xliv. (1888), p.\r\n71.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 324.--Section of Dolerite Sill cut by another sill,\r\nboth being traversed by dykes, Rudh' an Iasgaich, western side of\r\nSleat, Skye.]\r\n\r\nAbove the conglomeratic band lies a sheet of intrusive rock, which in\r\none place has apparently cut it out, so as to rest directly upon the\r\nTorridon Sandstone (_a_, Fig. 324). The decay of the softer detrital\r\nrock underneath has caused the sill to break off in slices, which have\r\nleft behind them a bold mural escarpment (_b_ _b_).\r\n\r\nThe rock of this sill is a rather coarsely crystalline porphyritic\r\nolivine-dolerite, which towards the north attains a thickness of about\r\n70 feet. It exhibits the usual prismatic jointing, but less perfectly\r\nthan some of the Trotternish sills already referred to. Besides these\r\nvertical joints, it is also traversed by a system of horizontal\r\ndivisional planes which, though somewhat irregular in their course,\r\nrun, in a general sense, parallel to the upper and under surfaces of\r\nthe sill.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been along this transverse series of joints that a\r\nsecond sill (_c_), five or six feet thick, has been injected. The\r\nmaterial of this younger intrusion is a black, finely crystalline\r\ndolerite or basalt, with rudely prismatic jointing. Its most striking\r\nfeature, besides its regularity of position and persistency for several\r\nhundred yards as a platform along the shore, is the basalt-glass which\r\nmarks both its under and upper surfaces of contact, and which is here\r\ndeveloped upon a scale to which I have not met with an equal among the\r\nTertiary sills of this country.\r\n\r\nThe selvage of glass appears as a black tar-like layer, varying from\r\na mere film to two or three inches in thickness. It is found not only\r\non the upper and under surfaces, but descends along abrupt step-like\r\ninterruptions of the upper surface, a foot or more in height, as if the\r\nsill had been broken by a series of subsidences. The apparent fracture,\r\nhowever, is probably due to the irregularities of the passage forced\r\nfor itself by the molten rock as it passed from one line of horizontal\r\njoint to another through the heart of the older sheet.\r\n\r\nThe exposed surface of black glass on the top of the younger sill\r\nexhibits long parallel lines, probably marking flow-structure, which\r\nare made conspicuous by a pale yellow ferruginous weathered crust.\r\nPortions of the larger intrusive sheet have been broken off and\r\ninvolved in the later rock. The younger sill disappears to the north,\r\nand is not found in the cliff of Rudha Chàrn nan Cearc, where the\r\nthick sill, lying once more on the band of conglomerate, forms a fine\r\nescarpment above the shore. Dykes of fine-grained basalt (_d_ _d_) with\r\ncompact chilled margins rise through both sills, together with veins\r\nwhich pursue a wavy upward path like strips of black ribbon.\r\n\r\nThis example, and that of the Shiant Isles already described, cannot\r\nbut impress the observer with the prodigious force with which the\r\nmaterial of the sills was injected. In these instances solid sheets\r\nof intrusive rock have subsequently been rent open, doubtless under a\r\nsuperincumbent pressure of many hundreds of feet of the terrestrial\r\ncrust, and a new injection of molten magma has made its way into\r\nthe rents thus caused. In each case, the position of the rents was\r\nobviously determined by structural lines in the older sills, but we are\r\nlost in astonishment at the energy required to split open, even along\r\nthese lines, such solid crystalline masses as the thick sills, and to\r\novercome the superincumbent pressure of so deep a pile of rock.\r\n\r\nThe isolation of a relic of the Tertiary sills on the west side of\r\nthe promontory of Sleat presents some interesting problems to the\r\nmind of the geologist. The locality lies about midway between the\r\nbasalt-plateau of Strathaird and that of Eigg, and some eight or nine\r\nmiles in a direct line from either. The basalts cannot be proved to\r\nhave once stretched continuously between Eigg and Strathaird, and to\r\nhave covered this part of Sleat; but the position of the Sleat sills\r\nmakes it probable that this continuation did formerly exist. The\r\ndenudation of the West of Scotland since early Tertiary time has been\r\nso stupendous that I am prepared for almost any seemingly incredible\r\nevidence of its effects. There can hardly be any doubt, however, that\r\nthe sills here described belong to the great platform of intrusive\r\nsheets, and that they were injected under a pile of Secondary strata,\r\nif not also of Tertiary basalts, which has here been entirely removed.\r\n\r\nReference may be made, in conclusion, to a not infrequent feature of\r\nthe Skye sills. Like the dykes, they are often double or multiple,\r\nmolten material having been successively injected along the same plane.\r\nThe example just cited from the west side of Sleat illustrates one\r\ntype of such compound sills. More frequently, however, the subsequent\r\ninjections have been made along the floor or roof of the first sheet.\r\nMr. Harker has found numerous cases of this structure in the Strath\r\ndistrict. They are recognizable even from a distance by their terraced\r\ncontours when seen in profile. They often vary considerably in\r\nthickness owing to the dying out or coming-in of their separate bands;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, single sills tend to maintain a uniform\r\nthickness for long distances, or taper away gradually. The compound\r\narrangement of the basic sills is well brought out where acid material\r\nhas been injected between the sheets, as will be more fully described\r\nin Chapter xlviii.\r\n\r\n\r\niii. EIGG, ARDNAMURCHAN\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of the coasts of Skye are repeated on the east side of\r\nRaasay, in Eigg, and still more magnificently along the south coast\r\nof Mull. A single example is here given (Fig. 325) from the east side\r\nof Eigg. Over the Jurassic sandstones (_a_ _a_) a sill of basalt (1)\r\nfour to six feet thick has been injected between the stratification,\r\nand another (2) two to four feet thick has forced its way across the\r\nmiddle of one of the bedded basalts (_b_ _b_) in which it bifurcates,\r\nand above which comes the thick series of lavas of the plateau (_c_,\r\n_d_). In one of the streamlets, which exposes a section of the Jurassic\r\nstrata below the volcanic escarpment, more than twenty intrusive sheets\r\nmay be counted among the shales and limestones. They are sometimes not\r\nsix inches thick, and seldom exceed six or eight feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 325.--Section to show Bedded and Intrusive Sheets,\r\nEigg.]\r\n\r\nI will conclude this account of the Tertiary basic sills of Britain\r\nby referring to one further district in the West of Scotland,\r\nwhere they are well displayed on bare hillslopes and also along a\r\npicturesque sea-coast. In the promontory of Ardnamurchan in the west of\r\nArgyleshire, one of the most conspicuous eminences, known as Ben Hiant,\r\naffords a striking mass of intrusive material, which, extending along\r\na rugged shore for three-quarters of a mile, mounts thence inland in a\r\nseries of rocky knolls, and in rather less than a mile culminates in a\r\nsummit, 1729 feet above sea-level.[320] The rocks which cover this large\r\nspace are disposed in numerous rude beds, which have a seaward dip of\r\nperhaps 15° to 20°, and are sometimes distinctly prismatic, the prisms\r\nbeing not infrequently grouped in fan-shape. They are evidently due\r\nto successive intrusions. Although generally coarsely crystalline in\r\ntexture, they include also intermediate and fine-grained sheets. They\r\nare never, so far as I have been able to discover, amygdaloidal,[321]\r\nnor do they present the ordinary external characters of the beds of\r\nthe plateaux, though here and there they appear to have caught up\r\nportions of the plateau-series. They distinctly overlie the bedded\r\nbasalts on their eastern and southern margins; but westwards they\r\nappear to lie transgressively across the edges of these rocks, while\r\nto the north-west and north they rest on quartzites and schists and on\r\nJurassic limestones. An outlier from the main mass forms the prominent\r\nhill of Sròn Mhor, and can be seen distinctly overlying the bedded\r\nbasalts as well as the neck of agglomerate already described (Fig. 302).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 320: This locality has been described by Professor Judd\r\n(_Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ xxx. (1874), p. 261; and xlvi. (1890), p.\r\n373).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 321: As amygdaloidal structure is occasionally to be found\r\namong both dykes and sills its presence in the Ben Hiant rocks would\r\nnot be inconsistent with their intrusive origin.]\r\n\r\nThe prevalent rocks of Ben Hiant are well crystallized, ophitic\r\nolivine-dolerites and gabbros. A specimen taken from the shore on the\r\nwest side of the mass was found by Dr. Hatch to present under the\r\nmicroscope its augite in large plates, which enclose narrow laths and\r\nneedles of plagioclase felspar as well as grains of olivine. All the\r\nfelspars are in lath-shapes, sometimes extremely long and narrow. The\r\niron-ore likewise assumes an ophitic character, enclosing rectangular\r\nportions of felspar. Dr. Hatch observed in another specimen, taken\r\nfrom the south-east side of the hill, \"a curious intermixture of two\r\ndifferent structures. Scattered portions which show the usual ophitic\r\nstructure, their felspar and augite occurring in large crystals,\r\nare, so to speak, imbedded in a groundmass which presents rather\r\na basaltic type, its felspar, augite, and magnetite, in long thin\r\nneedles, microlites, and other skeleton forms, being enclosed in a\r\ndark devitrified base.\" A third specimen, selected from one of the\r\ncolumnar sheets near the top of Ben Hiant, is \"a fine-grained dolerite\r\n(or gabbro) showing little ophitic structure, the augite occurring in\r\nroundish grains, and only slightly intergrown with the felspars, which\r\nare more or less lath-shaped. The rock contains a considerable quantity\r\nof black iron-ore in irregular grains and some dirty-green viridite.\"\r\nStill another variety of structure occurs in a specimen which I broke\r\nfrom one of the shore crags on the south-west side of the hill.\r\nUnder the microscope, Dr. Hatch found in it a beautiful aggregate of\r\n\"skeleton crystals and microlites of plagioclase, with here and there\r\na rectangular crystal, long slender microlites of augite, and short\r\nserrated microlites of magnetite, the whole being confusedly imbedded\r\nin a dark glassy base powdered over with a fine magnetite dust.\"[322] A\r\nsill of pitchstone lies among the bedded basalts on the east side of\r\nthe hill.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 322: Professor Judd has called the rocks of Beinn Hiant\r\naugite-andesites, and has given descriptions and figures of their\r\nstructure, and analyses of their chemical composition (_op. cit._).]\r\n\r\nFrom a number of specimens collected by me during a second visit to\r\nthis district in the summer of 1896, I selected some for microscopic\r\nexamination and submitted them to Mr. Harker, who has furnished me with\r\nthe following descriptions of them: \"The sill at the north end of Camas\r\nna Cloiche, Ben Hiant [7114] is an olivine-gabbro of medium grain and\r\nfresh appearance. Olivine, fresh or partly serpentinized, is plentiful.\r\nThe felspar is a labradorite with Carlsbad- and albite- (rarely\r\npericline-) twinning, and some of it has zonary banding. It is for the\r\nmost part in crystals giving rectangular sections, but there are some\r\nof allotriomorphic form. Magnetite occurs chiefly in shapeless grains\r\nof later crystallization than the felspar, but sometimes presenting\r\ncrystal-faces to the augite. The augite is light-brown in the slice,\r\nwithout any true diallage-structure, and tends to enwrap the earlier\r\nminerals in ophitic patches.\r\n\r\n\"The sill south of Uamh na Creadha, on the west side of Ben\r\nHiant [7115], is a rock of different type, having porphyritic\r\ncrystals of felspar, up to an inch or more in length, in a rather\r\nfinely-crystalline groundmass. The microscope shows it to be a dolerite\r\nof granulitic structure, the main mass of the rock consisting of little\r\nstriated labradorite-crystals, grains of pyroxene, and rather abundant\r\ncrystal-grains of magnetite. The pyroxene seems to be chiefly augite,\r\nbut hypersthene is also present, and builds rather larger and more\r\nidiomorphic crystals with characteristic pleochroism.\"\r\n\r\nIn rambling over this Ardnamurchan district I have often been reminded\r\nof the great intrusive sheets of Fair Head. One of the features in\r\nwhich the rocks of the two localities resemble each other is their\r\ntendency to assume a coarsely crystalline texture. In some parts of\r\nBen Hiant the individual crystals reach an inch or more in length.\r\nThese more largely crystalline portions, however, do not form distinct\r\nbands so much as patches in the midst of the general mass; at least I\r\nhave not noticed any examples of such veins of segregation as are so\r\nprominent in Antrim.\r\n\r\nNo one familiar with the well-marked distinctions between the lavas of\r\nthe plateaux and the sills which traverse them can hesitate in which\r\nseries to place the rocks of Ben Hiant. Since, however, these rocks\r\nhave been claimed by Professor Judd as the superficial lava-currents of\r\na volcano which broke out after the time of the plateau-basalts, like\r\nthe Scuir of Eigg, some further details in regard to the geological\r\nstructure of the district, which would otherwise be superfluous, may\r\nhere be given.\r\n\r\nThe number of sills and dykes in Ardnamurchan is astonishingly great.\r\nThere must be hundreds of them visible, and perhaps as many more\r\nconcealed under superficial coverings. They are well exposed on the\r\nshore traversing the Jurassic strata and the schists. The sills become\r\nespecially large and abundant in the direction of Ben Hiant, which has\r\nevidently been the principal centre from which their materials were\r\ninjected. The rocks composing these sills are quite similar to those\r\nof Ben Hiant, save that, as they occur in thinner sheets than in that\r\nmountain, they do not attain the same coarseness of texture which the\r\nmore massive beds there display. They generally possess fine-grained\r\nchilled selvages along their upper and under surfaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 326.--Ground-plan of Sills at Ben Hiant,\r\nArdnamurchan.\r\n\r\n_a_ _a_, crystalline schists; _b_ _b_, necks of volcanic agglomerate;\r\n_c_ _c_, numerous thin sills; D, massive sill of Beinn na h-Urchrach;\r\nE, north side of Ben Hiant; F, sill proceeding from the series forming\r\nBen Hiant and joining that of Beinn na h-Urchrach. The arrows mark the\r\ndip.]\r\n\r\nThese abundant sills may be traced up into the mass of Ben Hiant from\r\nwhich they have issued, and of the individual sheets of which they are\r\na continuation. One of the most striking and easily-followed examples\r\nof this connection is to be seen on the north side of the mountain.\r\nA thick sheet in the middle of Ben Hiant descends from among its\r\ncontiguous sheets and, as a prominent rib, runs down the scree-slope\r\ninto the valley below, where it forms a prominent feature. Crossing\r\nthe streamlet in the middle of the valley, where a section has been\r\ncut through its upper surface, it gradually bends round towards the\r\nnorth-east, mounts the side of Beinn na h-Urchrach until it reaches the\r\ncrest of the ridge and joins the other sills of which this eminence is\r\nbuilt up. The route of this band of rock will be understood from the\r\nannexed ground-plan (Fig. 326).\r\n\r\nThat this prolongation of one of the thick beds of Ben Hiant is in no\r\nrespect a superficial lava-stream but a true sill, is proved not only\r\nby its escarpment and dip-slope, but by its actually passing under and\r\nindurating the schistose grits, as may be seen in the stream-section.\r\nAgain Beinn na h-Urchrach, which is mapped by Professor Judd as a\r\nnorthern expansion of Ben Hiant, is likewise not a lava but a true\r\nsill. Not only does it dip northwards at an angle of about 20°, having\r\nthe schists immediately below its crest on the one side and descending\r\nwith a long dip-slope on the other, but dwindling down rapidly from\r\na thickness of 100 or 200 feet in the centre to no more than a few\r\nfeet in a south-westerly direction, it there passes under schistose\r\ngrits like those on which it lies. The strata that adhere to its upper\r\nsurface are as usual indurated.\r\n\r\nA section drawn across this attenuated development of the Beinn na\r\nh-Urchrach sill and that from Ben Hiant shows the structure represented\r\nin the accompanying diagram (Fig. 327), which simply gives the facts\r\nas exposed on the ground. The lower sill is that which issues from the\r\nmain body of Ben Hiant, massive at first but diminishing in thickness\r\nas it recedes from its source.\r\n\r\nAgain, among the sheets which descend from the northern face of the\r\nsummit of Ben Hiant and strike into the Jurassic outlier below,\r\nintensely indurated shale may be seen lying between two of the\r\ndolerites, which are unquestionably sills that have been injected into\r\nthe Jurassic series.\r\n\r\nThe ridge of Ben Hiant is thus found to consist of a thick and complex\r\nseries of sills, some of which are not traceable beyond the side of the\r\nmountain, while others can be followed outwards among the surrounding\r\nrocks. The specially marked dyke-like sills diverge from the main mass\r\nand run for some distance north-eastward, one of them, fully a mile\r\nlong, descending among the schists into the valley and ascending into\r\nthe basalt-plateau on the opposite side.[323]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 323: The sills of Ben Hiant descend on the south-west side into\r\nthe sea, and can be examined along the slopes and the beach, where\r\nProfessor Judd has mapped a continuous platform of agglomerate. The\r\nbroad hollow between that mountain and Beinn na h-Urchrach, over which\r\nhe has spread his \"augite-andesite lavas,\" appears to be underlain\r\nmainly by the crystalline schists through which sills from Ben Hiant\r\nhave been injected. The northern eminence, which he has united with Ben\r\nHiant, is entirely separate and, as above shown, is an obvious sill.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 327.--Section of two Sills in schistose grits, west\r\nend of Beinn na h-Urchrach, Ardnamurchan.\r\n\r\n_a_ _a_, crystalline schists; _b_, neck of volcanic agglomerate; _c_,\r\nsmall sill; D, massive sill of Beinn na h-Urchrach; F, sill proceeding\r\nfrom the series forming Ben Hiant and joining that of Beinn na\r\nh-Urchrach.]\r\n\r\nOn the south-east side of the mountain where the bedded basalts can\r\nbe traced close up to the intrusive dolerites, they are found to\r\npresent the usual dull indurated aspect so characteristic of contact\r\nalteration among these rocks. There cannot therefore be any doubt that\r\nBen Hiant never was itself a volcano. Its rocks are characteristically\r\nthose of subterranean intrusions. They seem to have been injected from\r\na line of fissure or from several such lines, running in a general\r\nnorth-easterly direction, at some late part of the volcanic period. The\r\ngroup of agglomerate necks of older date shows that already the ground\r\nunderneath had been drilled by a number of distinct volcanic funnels,\r\nand discloses a weak part in the terrestrial crust.\r\n\r\n\r\niv. FAROE ISLES\r\n\r\nIn the Faroe Islands the actual base of the volcanic series is\r\nnowhere visible. Hence, the great lower platform of intrusive sheets\r\nbeing there concealed, this feature of the basalt-plateaux is less\r\nconspicuous than it is in the Inner Hebrides. A number of sills,\r\nhowever, have been noticed by previous observers,[324] and I have\r\nobserved others on the sides of Stromö, Kalsö, Kunö and other islands.\r\nIn the lofty precipices of the Haraldsfjord, many of the massive\r\nlight-coloured prismatic sheets are intrusive, for though they preserve\r\ntheir parallelism with the bedded sheets for considerable distances,\r\nthey may be seen sometimes to break across these, as is strikingly\r\nshown in one of the great corries on the east side of Kunö.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 324: See in particular Prof. James Geikie and Mr. Lomas, in the\r\npapers already cited on p. 191.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 328.--Sill traversing bedded Basalts, cliffs of\r\nStromö, at entrance of Vaagöfjord.\r\n\r\nThe caves and notches shown at the bottom of the precipice mark the\r\nposition of the vents represented in Figs. 311, 312, 313, 314.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable sills in the Faroe Islands is probably that\r\nwhich forms so prominent an object on the western cliffs of Stromö, at\r\nthe entrance into the Vaagöfjord (Figs. 328, 329). It is prismatic in\r\nstructure, and where it runs along the face of the cliffs, parallel\r\nto the bedded basalts among which it has been intruded, presents the\r\nfamiliar characters of such sheets. The precipice of which it forms\r\na part is that which rises above the row of volcanic vents already\r\ndescribed. But it there begins to ascend the cliffs obliquely across\r\nthe basalts until it reaches the crest of the great wall of volcanic\r\nrock at a height of probably about 1000 feet above the waves. From the\r\ncrest of the precipice the upward course of the sill is continued into\r\nthe interior of the island. It pursues its way as a line of bold crag\r\nalong the ridges of the plateau, gradually ascending till it forms the\r\nsummit of one of the most prominent hills in the district (Fig. 329).\r\n\r\nSome further idea of the enormous energy with which the sills were\r\ninjected may be formed from this example, where the eruptive materials\r\nfollowed neither the line of bedding nor a vertical fissure, but took\r\nan oblique course through the plateau-basalts for a vertical distance\r\nof probably more than 1500 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. GENERAL DEDUCTIONS REGARDING THE TERTIARY BASIC SILLS\r\n\r\nIf we consider the facts which have now been adduced regarding\r\nthe position and structure of the sills, we are led, I think, to\r\nregard these masses as certainly belonging to the history of the\r\nbasalt-plateaux, but, on the whole, to a comparatively late part of\r\nit. They consist of essentially the same materials as the lavas that\r\nform these plateaux, though with the differences of structure which the\r\nconditions of their production would lead us naturally to expect. Where\r\nthey occur in thick masses, which must obviously have cooled much more\r\nslowly at some depth beneath the surface than the comparatively thin\r\nsheets could do that were poured out above ground, they have assumed\r\na far more largely crystalline texture than that of the superficial\r\nlavas. As a rule, we may say that the thicker the sill the coarser is\r\nits texture, while the thinnest sheets are the most close-grained.\r\nSills are especially abundant about the base of the basaltic-plateaux.\r\nWe may examine miles of the central and higher parts of the escarpments\r\nwithout detecting a single example of them, but if the escarpment is\r\ncut down to the base we seldom need to search far to find them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 329.--View of the same Sill seen from the channel\r\nopposite the island of Kolter.]\r\n\r\nThat the efforts of the internal magma to establish an outlet\r\ntowards the surface were accompanied by powerful disturbances of the\r\nterrestrial crust is shown by the abundant dykes which traverse all the\r\nvolcanic districts from Antrim to Iceland, and some of which ascend\r\neven to the very highest remaining lavas of the basalt-plateaux. The\r\nparallel fissures filled by these dykes prove that even after the\r\naccumulation of more than 3000 feet of basalt-sheets, the movements\r\ncontinued to be so powerful as to disrupt these vast piles of volcanic\r\nmaterial. But undoubtedly the highest parts of the plateau-basalts are\r\nless cut by dykes than the lower parts. There would no doubt come a\r\ntime when the dislocations would more seldom reach the surface, when\r\ndykes would not be formed so abundantly or up to such a high level, and\r\nwhen the volcanic energies would more and more sparingly result in the\r\nopening of new vents or in the discharge of fresh eruptions from old\r\nones.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me most probable that the injection of the sills was\r\nconnected with the same terrestrial disturbances that produced the\r\ndykes which traverse the plateaux. Besides being dislocated by parallel\r\nfissures, the earth's crust in North-Western Europe seems to have been\r\nruptured internally along lines more or less at right angles to the\r\nvertical fissures. The deep accumulation of bedded basalts presented\r\nan increasing obstacle to the ascent of the magma to the surface.\r\nUnable to gain ample enough egress through such vertical fissures as\r\nmight be formed in the volcanic pile, the molten rock would find its\r\nlines of least resistance along the planes of the strata and the lower\r\nbasalt-beds, either by the aid of terrestrial ruptures there, or in\r\nvirtue of its own energy. On these horizons, accordingly, the sills\r\noccur in extraordinary profusion throughout the volcanic regions. They\r\nare no doubt of all ages in the progress of the building up of the\r\nvolcanic plateaux, but I am disposed to believe that a large number\r\nof them may belong to the very latest period of the uprise of basalt\r\nwithin the area of Britain.\r\n\r\nOne of the most suggestive features of the abundant Tertiary sills\r\nlies in the evidence they furnish of the enormous energy concerned\r\nin the ascent and intrusion of volcanic material. The infilling of\r\ndykes or the outpouring of successive streams of lava at the surface\r\nhardly appeals to our imagination so strikingly as the proof that the\r\nsills have been impelled into their places with a vigour which, even\r\nwhen guided and aided by gigantic terrestrial ruptures, was capable of\r\novercoming the vertical pressure of hundreds, or even thousands of feet\r\nof overlying rock. Had these intrusive sheets been mere thin layers,\r\ntheir horizontal extent and persistence would still have excited our\r\nastonishment, but when we find them sometimes several hundred feet\r\nthick, and to extend in a continuous series for horizontal distances\r\nof 50 miles or more, we are lost in wonder at the prodigious expansive\r\nstrength of the volcanic forces. Again, the intrusions have not always\r\ntaken place between the bedding-planes of the stratified or igneous\r\nrocks, but, as we have seen, solid sheets of already deeply buried\r\nlavas have sometimes been split open and the intrusive material has\r\nforced itself between the disrupted portions. Such subterranean proofs\r\nof the vigour of volcanic energy teach some of the most impressive\r\nlessons in the chronicles of volcanic action in the British Isles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn closing this history of the accumulation of the great Tertiary\r\nvolcanic plateaux of North-Western Europe, I would remark that as the\r\nresult of prolonged eruptions from innumerable vents, the depression\r\nthat extended from the south of Antrim to the Minch was gradually\r\nfilled up with successive sheets of basalt to a depth of more than 3000\r\nfeet. A succession of lava-fields stretched from the North of Ireland\r\nacross the West of Scotland, and perhaps even to the Faroe Islands,\r\nIceland and Greenland. That the lava spread round the base of the\r\nHighland mountains and ran up the Highland glens, much as the sea now\r\ndoes, is made clear from the position of the outliers of it which have\r\nbeen left perched on the ridges of Morven and Ardnamurchan. So far as\r\ncan now be surmised, these wide Phlegræan fields were only varied by\r\noccasional volcanic cones scattered over their surface, marking some\r\nof the last vents from which streams of basalt had flowed. But the\r\nvolcanic energy was still far from exhaustion. After the accumulation\r\nof such a deep and far-extended sheet of lava, those underground\r\nmovements which produced the fissures that served as channels for the\r\nuprise of the earliest dykes continued to show their vigour. The pile\r\nof bedded lavas was rent open by innumerable long parallel fissures\r\nin the prevalent north-westerly direction, up which basic lavas rose\r\nto form dykes, while vast numbers of sills were injected underneath.\r\nWhether the outflow of basalt at the surface had wholly ceased when\r\nthe last of these dykes were injected into the plateaux cannot be\r\ntold. Nor is there any evidence whether it had ended before the next\r\ngreat episode of the volcanic history--the extravasation of the gabbro\r\nbosses. All that we can affirm with certainty is, that the formation\r\nof north-west fissures and the uprise of basalt in them were again\r\nrepeated, for we find north-west dykes traversing even the crests of\r\nthe later eruptive masses of basic and acid rocks. It is difficult to\r\nsuppose that none of these latest dykes communicated with the surface,\r\nand gave rise to cones with the outpouring of basalt and the ejection\r\nof dust and stones. But of such later outflows of basic material over\r\nthe surface of the plateaux no undoubted trace has yet been recognised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\n                    THE BOSSES AND SHEETS OF GABBRO\r\n\r\n  Petrography of the Rocks--Relations of the Gabbros to the other\r\n  members of the Volcanic series--Description of the Gabbro\r\n  districts--Skye\r\n\r\n\r\nIn singular contrast to the nearly flat basalts of the plateaux,\r\nanother series of rocks rises high and abruptly above these tablelands\r\ninto groups of dome-shaped, conical, spiry, and rugged hills. It is\r\nthese heights which, more than any other feature, relieve the monotony\r\nof the wide areas of almost horizontal stratification so characteristic\r\nof the volcanic region of the north-west. Their geological structure\r\nand history are much less obvious than those of the bedded basalts.\r\nTheir mountainous forms at once suggest a wholly different origin. Some\r\nportions of them have even been compared with the oldest or Archæan\r\nrocks.[325] That they are really portions of the Tertiary volcanic\r\nseries, and that they reveal a wholly distinct phase in the history of\r\nvolcanic action, is now frankly admitted. Whether we regard them from\r\nthe petrographical or structural point of view, they naturally arrange\r\nthemselves into two well-defined groups. Of these one consists of\r\nhighly basic compounds, of which olivine-gabbro is the most prominent.\r\nThe other comprises numerous varieties--granite, granophyre, felsite,\r\nquartz-porphyry, pitchstone and others--all of them being more or less\r\ndecidedly acid, and some of them markedly so. For reasons which will\r\nappear in the sequel, the former group must be considered as the older\r\nof the two, and it will therefore be described first.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 325: This was my own first impression, when I began, as a\r\nboy, to ramble among them. The remarkable resemblance of some parts\r\nof them to ancient gneisses will be afterwards dwelt upon. Macculloch\r\nhad correctly grouped them with the other overlying rocks, and this\r\nconclusion was afterwards confirmed by Prof. Zirkel.]\r\n\r\n\r\ni. PETROGRAPHY OF THE GABBRO AREAS\r\n\r\nSince the publications of Macculloch, the occurrence of beautiful\r\nvarieties of highly basic rocks among the igneous masses of the\r\nWestern Isles has been familiar to geologists. They were named by him\r\n\"hypersthene rock\" and \"augite rock,\"[326] names which continued in use\r\nuntil 1871, when my friend Professor Zirkel published the results\r\nof his tour through the West of Scotland, and showed that the rocks\r\nin question were mostly true gabbros.[327] Since his observations were\r\npublished some of these rocks have formed the subject of important\r\npapers by Professor Judd.[328]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 326: _Western Islands_, vol. i. pp. 385, 484.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 327: _Zeitschrift. Deutsch. Geol. Gesellsch._ xxiii. (1871), p.\r\n1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 328: _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ xli. (1885), p. 354; xlii.\r\n(1886), p. 49.]\r\n\r\nThe general petrographical characters of the gabbro areas of Western\r\nScotland may be summarized as follows:--A very considerable variety of\r\npetrological structure and chemical composition is observable among the\r\nrocks. At the one end of the series are compounds of plagioclase and\r\naugite, which, though wanting in olivine, have the general structure\r\nand habit of dolerites. At the other end are mixtures wherein felspar\r\nis scarce or absent, and where olivine becomes the chief constituent.\r\nBetween these two extremes are many intermediate grades, of which the\r\nmost important are those containing the variety of augite known as\r\ndiallage and also olivine. These are the olivine-gabbros, which form so\r\nmarked a feature in the central parts of the great basic bosses. That\r\nsome of these varieties of rock pass into each other cannot be doubted.\r\nTheir distinctive composition and structure appear to have been\r\nlargely determined by their position in the eruptive mass. The outer\r\nand thinner sheets are in great measure dolerites, with little or no\r\nolivine. Coarse gabbros are abundant in the inner portions. Rocks rich\r\nin olivine, however, occur at the outer and especially the lower part\r\nof the gabbro masses of Rum and in some parts of Skye. The following\r\nleading varieties may be enumerated:--\r\n\r\nDolerite.--This rock varies from an exceedingly close grain (when\r\nit approaches and graduates into basalt) up to a coarse granular\r\ncrystalline texture, in which the component minerals are distinctly\r\nvisible to the naked eye. An average sample is found to consist of\r\nplagioclase, usually lath-shaped, and crystals or grains of augite\r\nwith or without olivine. Under the microscope, the different varieties\r\nare distinguished by the presence of more or less distinct ophitic\r\nstructure, the felspar being enveloped in the augite. For the most\r\npart they are holocrystalline, but occasionally show traces of a\r\nglassy base. Ilmenite is not infrequent, with its characteristic\r\nturbid decomposition product (leucoxene). In other cases, the iron-ore\r\nis probably magnetite. Between the dolerites and gabbros no line of\r\ndemarcation can be drawn in the field, nor can a much more satisfactory\r\nlimitation be made even with the aid of the microscope. As a rule, the\r\nthickest and largest intrusive masses or bosses are gabbro, those of\r\nless size are dolerite, while the smallest (and sometimes the edges of\r\nthe others) assume externally the aspect of basalts.\r\n\r\nGabbro.--Under this term I arrange, as proposed by Professor Judd,\r\nall the coarse-grained granitoid basic rocks of the region without\r\nreference to the variety of augite present in them. Under the\r\nmicroscope, they are found to be holocrystalline, but with a granitic\r\nor granulitic rather than an ophitic structure, though traces of the\r\nlatter are by no means rare. To the naked eye their component minerals\r\nare usually recognizable. Professor Zirkel, from his examination\r\nof the Mull gabbros, believed them to consist of three parts of\r\nplagioclase, two parts of olivine, and one part of diallage.[329]\r\nOlivine, however, is not invariably present.[330] The pyroxene also does\r\nnot always show the peculiar fibrous structure of diallage. Professor\r\nJudd, indeed, maintains that the diallagic form is due to a deep-seated\r\nprocess of alteration (schillerization), and that the same crystal may\r\nconsist partly of ordinary augite and partly of diallage.[331] Ilmenite\r\n(with leucoxene), magnetite, apatite, biotite, and epidote are not\r\ninfrequent constituents.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 329: _Zeitschr. Deutsch. Geol. Gesellsch._ xxiii. (1871), p.\r\n59.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 330: Professor Judd (_Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ xlii. p. 62)\r\nbelieves that originally all the gabbros contained olivine, and\r\nthat where it is now absent, it has been altered into magnetite or\r\nserpentine. But in some coarse massive gabbros this mineral does not\r\nappear to have been an essential constituent. See _op. cit._ vol. l. p.\r\n654.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 331: _Op. cit._ xli. In a later paper he insists on\r\nthe gradation of the coarse granitoid varieties (gabbros) into\r\nholocrystalline compounds, where the felspar appears in lath-shapes\r\nwith crystals or rounded grains of augite and olivine (dolerites), and\r\nthence into true basalts, magma-basalts, and tachylytes (_op. cit._\r\nxlii. p. 62).]\r\n\r\nIn a recent study of the gabbros of the Cuillin Hills of Skye by\r\nMr. J. J. H. Teall and myself, four characteristic types have been\r\nrecognized.[332]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 332: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. 1. (1894), pp. 645-659,\r\nand Plates xiii. xxvi.-xxviii. See also Prof. Judd's paper, _op. cit._\r\n(1886), p. 49.]\r\n\r\n(1) _Granulitic Gabbros._--These are dark, fine-grained rocks which\r\nexternally resemble some of the altered basalts of the plateau-series.\r\nThey occur in bands or sheets which, so far as can be made out, are the\r\noldest portions of the whole gabbro mass. Under the microscope they\r\nare found to possess a finely granulitic structure, and to consist\r\nof grains of pyroxene (augite, but more usually with the inclusions\r\ncharacteristic of diallage and pseudo-hypersthene), and of felspar\r\nallied to labradorite, with green pseudomorphs agreeing in form and\r\nsize with the pyroxene-grains, but made of minute prisms and fibres of\r\ngreen hornblende and a little chlorite.\r\n\r\n(2) _Banded Gabbros._--These are characterized by a remarkable\r\narrangement in parallel bands of different mineral composition\r\nlike the banding of ancient gneisses. This structure will be more\r\nparticularly described in later pages. They are coarse-grained rocks\r\ncomposed of pyroxene, plagioclase, olivine and magnetite. But these\r\nminerals are not distributed equally through the mass. The pale bands\r\ncontain much felspar; the dark bands are largely composed of the\r\nferro-magnesian minerals and magnetite. The pyroxene, occurring as\r\nordinary augite, not uncommonly shows a tendency to ophitic structure.\r\nThe felspar, a variety closely allied to labradorite, occurs as\r\ngrains, as irregular ophitic patches, and also in forms that give\r\nbroad rectangular sections. Olivine in an unaltered condition has\r\nbeen detected by Mr. Teall in only one specimen, and he thinks that\r\nthis mineral probably never played an important part in the original\r\nconstitution of these rocks. Its rounded grains may be observed to\r\nhave the other minerals moulded round them, whence it may be inferred\r\nto be of older consolidation. Magnetite is generally present, either\r\nin rounded grains or in large irregular masses. Though it occurs also\r\nin strings traversing the other minerals as a secondary product, it\r\nmust undoubtedly have entered largely into the original composition\r\nof these rocks. It is found enclosing the augite grains and behaving\r\nlike a groundmass between the felspars. Among the dark bands there\r\noccur narrow lenticular black layers ('schlieren') composed entirely of\r\naugite and iron-ore.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary differences between the composition of the pale\r\nfelspathic and the dark ultra-basic bands are well brought out in\r\nthe following analyses by Mr. J. Hort Player, No. 1 being from a\r\nlight-coloured band consisting mainly of labradorite with some augite,\r\nuralitic hornblende and magnetite; No. 2 from a dark band composed of\r\naugite, magnetite and labradorite; and No. 3 from a thin ultra-basic\r\nlayer mainly formed of augite and magnetite. All these specimens were\r\ntaken from the ridge of Druim an Eidhne, on the eastern side of the\r\nCuillin Hills, Skye.[333]\r\n\r\n                          I.    II.

They occur as sheets, veins and\r\nirregular masses traversing the varieties of gabbro already mentioned.\r\nThey consist of the same minerals as the banded forms, and indeed are\r\nthemselves sometimes banded. They are more uniform in composition than\r\nthe typical banded gabbros, though showing also some variation in the\r\nrelative proportions of their constituents. The specific gravity of\r\nthree specimens was found to be 2·82, 2·97, and 3·06.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 330.--Granulitic and coarsely foliated gabbro\r\ntraversed by later veins of felspathic gabbro, Druim an Eidhne, Cuillin\r\nHills, Skye.]\r\n\r\n(4) _Pale Gabbros of the Veins._--These occur abundantly as irregular\r\nbranching veins, from less than an inch to several yards in width,\r\nand cross all the other varieties (Fig. 330[334]). Their whiteness on\r\nweathered surfaces makes them conspicuous by contrast with the dark\r\nbrown or black hue of the rocks which they traverse, and shows at\r\nonce that they must be poorer in bases than these. They are found on\r\nmicroscopic examination to consist of the same minerals as the more\r\ncoarsely crystalline gabbros, but with a much greater abundance of\r\nthe felspar. They contain also apatite, and hornblende appears to\r\npredominate in them over augite. They are to be distinguished from the\r\npale veins that form apophyses from the intrusive granophyres.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 334: Figs. 330, 336 and 337 are from photographs taken for the\r\nGeological Survey by Mr. R. Lunn.]\r\n\r\nTroctolite (Forellenstein).--This beautiful variety of\r\nplagioclase-olivine rock occurs as a conspicuous feature on the east\r\nside of the gabbro-area of the island of Rum. It forms a sill on the\r\nside of the mountain Allival, in which the component minerals are drawn\r\nout parallel with the upper and under surfaces of the bed (Fig. 341).\r\nSo marked is this flow-structure that hand-specimens might readily\r\nbe taken at the first glance for ancient schistose limestone. \"The\r\nfelspathic ingredient (probably labradorite or anorthite) is white,\r\nand its lath-shaped crystals have ranged themselves with their long\r\naxes parallel to the line of flow. The olivine occurs in perfectly\r\nfresh grains, which in hand-specimens have a delicate green tint.\r\nUnder the microscope they appear colourless, and are penetrated by\r\nthe felspar prisms in ophitic intergrowth. There is a small quantity\r\nof a pale brownish augite, which not only occurs in wedge-shaped\r\nportions between the felspars, but also as a narrow zone round the\r\nolivines.\"[335] Considerable differences are visible in the development\r\nof the flow-structure, and with these there appear to be accompanying\r\nvariations in the microscopic structure. Dr. Hatch, to whom I submitted\r\nmy specimens, informed me that in one of them, where the flow-structure\r\nis so marked as to give a finely schistose aspect to the rock, \"there\r\nis a larger proportion of augite, some of which exhibits a distinct\r\ndiallagic striping; the olivine grains show no ophitic structure, but\r\nare sometimes completely embedded in the augite.\" To this remarkable\r\nflow-structure I shall again refer in connection with the light it\r\nthrows on the bedded character of much of the gabbro bosses.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 335: MS. of Dr. Hatch.]\r\n\r\nBetween the different basic intrusive igneous rocks of the Inner\r\nHebrides, as Professor Judd has shown, there are many gradations\r\naccording to the varying proportions of the chief component minerals.\r\nThus from the olivine-gabbros, by the diminution or disappearance of\r\nthe augite we get such rocks as troctolite; where the plagioclase\r\ndiminishes or vanishes, we have different forms of picrite; where the\r\nolivine is left out, we come to compounds, like eucrite; while by the\r\nlessening or disappearance of the felspar and augite, we are led to\r\nultra basic compounds, consisting in greatest part of olivine, like\r\nlherzolite, dunite and serpentine. To some of the features and probable\r\norigin of these chemical and mineralogical diversities in the same\r\ngreat eruptive mass further reference will be made in later pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. RELATIONS OF THE GABBROS TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE VOLCANIC SERIES\r\n\r\nVarious opinions have been expressed regarding the connection between\r\nthe amorphous eruptive rocks of the hill-groups and the level\r\nbasalt-sheets of the plateaux. Jameson, though he landed at Rudh' an\r\nDunain, in Skye, where this connection can readily be found, does not\r\nseem to have made any attempt to ascertain it. He noticed that the\r\nlower grounds were formed of basalt, and that the mountains \"appeared\r\nto be wholly composed of syenite and hornblende rock, traversed\r\nby basalt veins.\"[336] Macculloch, in many passages of his _Western\r\nIslands_, alludes to the subject as one which he knew would interest\r\ngeologists, but about which he felt that he could give no satisfactory\r\ninformation, and with characteristic verbiage he refers to the\r\nimpossibility of determining boundaries, to the transition from one\r\nrock into another, to the inaccessible nature of the ground, to the\r\nalmost insuperable obstacles that impede examination, to the distance\r\nfrom human habitation, and to the stormy climate,--a formidable list of\r\nbarriers, in presence of which he leaves the relative position and age\r\nof the rocks unsettled.[337]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 336: _Mineralogical Travels_ (1813), vol. ii. p. 72.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 337: See his _Western Islands_, vol. i. pp. 368, 374, 385,\r\n386. With much admiration for the insight and zeal, amounting almost\r\nto genius, which Macculloch displayed in his work among the Western\r\nIslands, at a time when, with poor maps and inadequate means of\r\nlocomotion, geological surveying was a more difficult task than it\r\nis now, I have found it impossible to follow in his footsteps with\r\nhis descriptions in hand, and not to wish that for his own fame he\r\nhad been content to claim credit only for what he had seen. His\r\nactual achievements were enough to make the reputation of half a\r\ndozen good geologists. It was unfortunate that he did not realize how\r\ninexhaustible nature is, how impossible it is for one man to see and\r\nunderstand every fact even in the little corner of nature which he may\r\nclaim to have explored. He seems to have had a morbid fear lest any one\r\nshould afterwards discover something he had missed; he writes as if\r\nwith the object of dissuading men from travelling over his ground, and\r\nhe indeed tacitly lays claim to anything they may ascertain by averring\r\nthat those who may follow him \"will find a great deal that is not\r\nhere described, although little that has not been examined\" (p. 373).\r\nPrincipal Forbes long ago exposed this weak side of Macculloch and his\r\nwork (_Edin. New Phil. Journ._ xl. 1846, p. 82).]\r\n\r\nVon Oyenhausen and Von Dechen, who wrote so excellent an account of\r\ntheir visit to Skye, and who traced much of the boundary-line between\r\nthe gabbros and the other mountainous eruptive masses (\"syenite\"), seem\r\nto have made no attempt to work out the connection between the former\r\nand the rest of the volcanic rocks.[338]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 338: Karsten's _Archiv_, i. p. 99. They frankly admit that\r\n\"the relation of the hypersthene rock to the other trap rocks was not\r\nascertained.\"]\r\n\r\nJ. D. Forbes, in his able sketch of the _Topography and Geology of\r\nthe Cuchullin Hills_, was the first to recognize the superposition\r\nof the \"hypersthene rock\" upon the \"common trap rocks\"--that is, the\r\nplateau-basalts. He was disposed to consider the \"hypersthene mass as\r\na vast bed, thinning out both ways, and inclined at a moderate angle\r\ntowards the S.E.\"[339]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 339: _Edin. New Phil. Journ._ xl. (1846), pp. 85, 86.]\r\n\r\nProfessor Judd regarded the bosses of basic and acid rocks that rise\r\nout of the bedded basalts as the basal cores of enormously denuded\r\nvolcanic cones. He believed the granitoid rocks to have been first\r\nerupted, and that after a long interval the basic masses were forced\r\nthrough them, partly consolidating underneath and partly appearing at\r\nthe surface as the plateau-basalts.[340] That the order of appearance\r\nof the several rocks has been exactly the reverse of this supposed\r\nsequence was fully established by me in the year 1888, and has since\r\nbeen amply confirmed.[341] Professor Zirkel recognized that the gabbros\r\nare a dependence of the basalts, that they overlie them, and that\r\non the naked flanks of the mountains they are regularly bedded with\r\nthem.[342]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 340: _Quart.

Some of the numerous impediments\r\nrecorded by Macculloch no doubt retarded the investigation. But, as\r\nForbes so well pointed out, there is really no serious difficulty in\r\ndetermining the true structural connection of the amorphous rocks\r\nwith each other and with the bedded basalts of the plateaux. I have\r\nascertained them in each of the districts,[343] and have found that there\r\ncannot be the least doubt that the amorphous bosses, both basic and\r\nacid, are younger than the surrounding bedded basalts, and that the\r\nacid protrusions are on the whole younger than the basic, I shall now\r\nproceed to show how these conclusions are established by the evidence\r\nof each of the areas where the several kinds of rock occur.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 343: In two of my excursions in Mull, and once in Skye, I was\r\naccompanied by my former colleague Mr. H.

DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SEVERAL GABBRO-DISTRICTS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _The Gabbro of Skye_\r\n\r\nThe largest, most picturesque, and to the geologist most important area\r\nof Tertiary gabbro in Britain, is that of Skye (Map. VI.). Though, like\r\nevery other portion of the Tertiary volcanic districts, it has suffered\r\nenormous denudation, and has thereby been trenched to the very core,\r\nit reveals, more conspicuously and clearly than can be seen anywhere\r\nelse, the relation of the gabbro to the bedded basalts on the one hand,\r\nand to the acid protrusions on the other. Its chief portion is that\r\nwhich rises into the group of the Cuillin Hills, which for blackness of\r\nhue, ruggedness of surface, jaggedness of crest, and general grimness\r\nof aspect, have certainly no rivals within the limits of the British\r\nIsles (Fig. 331). It has long been known to extend eastwards into\r\nBlath Bheinn (Blaven) and its immediate northern neighbours. There is,\r\nindeed, no break whatever between the rock of the Cuillins and that of\r\nthe hills on the east side of Strath na Creitheach. In Strath More the\r\ngabbro is interrupted by the granitoid mass of the Red Hills. Patches\r\nof it, however, occur further to the east, even as far as the Sound of\r\nScalpa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 331.--Scuir na Gillean, Cuillin Hills, shewing the\r\ncharacteristic craggy forms of the Gabbro. (From a photograph by Mr.\r\nAbraham, Keswick.)]\r\n\r\nIf we throw out of account the invading granitoid rocks, and look\r\nupon the whole tract within which the gabbro occurs as originally\r\none connected area, we find that it covered an elliptical space\r\nmeasuring about nine miles from south-west to north-east and six\r\nmiles from north-west to south-east, and embracing at least 40 square\r\nmiles.[344] But that its original size was greater is strikingly shown\r\nmore particularly on the western margin, which like that of the\r\nbasalt-escarpments, has obviously been determined by denudation, for\r\nits separate beds present their truncated ends to the horizon all along\r\nthe flanks of the Cuillins, from the head of Glen Brittle round to Loch\r\nScavaig (Fig. 332), and from Strath na Creitheach round the southern\r\nflanks of Blath Bheinn to Loch Slapin and Strath More.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 344: Though this and the other bosses are here spoken of\r\nas consisting of gabbro, it will be understood that this rock only\r\nconstitutes the larger portion of their mass, which includes also\r\ndolerites and other more basic compounds, together with involved\r\nportions of the plateau-basalts and masses of agglomerate which\r\nprobably mark the position of older vents.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 332.--Section across Glen Brittle, to show the\r\ngeneral relations of the Bedded Basalts (_a_) and the Gabbros (_b_).]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first point to be ascertained in regard to the gabbro and\r\nassociated basic rocks of the mountainous tract is their connection in\r\ngeological structure and age with the bedded basalts of the plateau.\r\nThis initial and fundamental relation, as Forbes long ago said, can\r\nbe examined along the whole western and southern flank of the Cuillin\r\nHills, from the foot of Glen Sligachan round to the mouth of Loch\r\nScavaig. Even from a distance, the observer, who is favoured with clear\r\nweather, can readily trace the almost level sheets of basalt till they\r\ndip gently under the darker, more massive rock of the hills. Tourists,\r\nwho approach Skye by way of Loch Coruisk, have an opportunity, as\r\nthe steamer nears the island of Soay, of following with the eye the\r\nbasalt-terraces of the promontory of Rudh' an Dunain until they\r\ndisappear under the gabbro of the last spur of the Cuillins that guards\r\nthe western entrance to Loch Scavaig.\r\n\r\nWhat is so evident at a distance becomes still more striking when\r\nviewed from nearer ground. Nowhere can it be more impressively seen\r\nthan at the head of Glen Brittle. Looking westwards, the traveller\r\nsees in front of him only the familiar level terraces and green slopes\r\nof the basalt-plateau, rising platform above platform to a height of\r\nnearly 1500 feet above the sea. But turning to the east, he beholds\r\nthe dark, gloomy, cauldron-like Corry na Creiche, from which rise some\r\nof the ruggedest and loftiest crests of the Cuillins. On the hills\r\nthat project from either side of this recess and half enclose it,\r\nthe bedded basalts mount from the bottom of the valley, with their\r\nlines of parallel terrace dipping gently inward below the black rugged\r\ngabbro that crowns them and sweeps round to form the back or head of\r\nthe corry. Down the whole length of Glen Brittle the same structure\r\nconspicuously governs the topographical features. On the right hand,\r\nthe ordinary terraced basalts form the slopes; and they rise for some\r\n500 or 600 feet up the eastern side, until they pass under the darker,\r\nmore rugged, and less distinctly bedded rocks of the mountains (Fig.\r\n332). The dip of the whole series is here at a gentle angle towards\r\nsouth-east, that is, into or under the main mass of the Cuillin group.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we proceed to examine the junction between the two\r\nrocks we find it to be less simple than it appears. It is not an\r\ninstance of mere superposition. The gabbro unquestionably overlies\r\nthe basalts, and is therefore of younger date. But it overlies them,\r\nnot as they rest on each other, in regular conformable sequence of\r\neruption, but intrusively, as a sill does upon the rocks on which it\r\nappears to follow in the unbroken order of accumulation. This important\r\nstructure may be ascertained in almost any of the many sections cut\r\nby the torrents which have so deeply trenched with gullies the flanks\r\nof the hills. Starting from the ordinary bedded basalts, we observe,\r\nin mounting the slopes and approaching the gabbro, that the rocks\r\ninsensibly assume that indurated shattery character, which has been\r\nreferred to as characteristic of them round the margins of vents,\r\nand which will be shown to be not less so in contact with large\r\neruptive masses of basic or acid rock.[345] Beds of dolerite make their\r\nappearance among the basalts, so distinctly crystalline, and so similar\r\nin character to the rocks of the sills, that there can be little\r\nhesitation in regarding them as intrusive. These sills increase in size\r\nand number as we ascend, though hardened amygdaloidal basalts may still\r\nbe observed. True gabbros then supervene in massive beds, and at last\r\nwe find ourselves entirely within the gabbro area, where, however, thin\r\nbands of highly altered basalt may still for some distance appear. One\r\nfurther fact will generally be noticed, viz. that before reaching the\r\nmain mass of gabbro, veins and sills of basalt, as well as of various\r\nfelsitic and porphyritic members of the acid group, come in abundantly,\r\ncrossing and recrossing each other in the most intricate network. The\r\nbase of the thick gabbro-sheets is thus another horizon on which, as on\r\nthat below the plateau-basalts, intrusive masses have been especially\r\ndeveloped. Through all these rocks numerous parallel basalt-dykes,\r\nrunning in a general persistent N.N.W. direction, with a later N.E.\r\nseries, rise from below the sea-level up even to the very crests of the\r\nCuillins (Fig. 333).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 345: This indurated, altered character of the bedded basalts\r\nnear the intrusive bosses and sills will be more particularly described\r\nin a later chapter in connection with the granophyre intrusions (see p.\r\n386). The metamorphism induced by the basic rocks has generally been\r\nless pronounced than that effected by the acid masses.]\r\n\r\nThe sections on the western side of the gabbro area of Skye thus prove\r\nthat this rock inosculates with the bedded basalts by sending into\r\nthem, between their bedding planes, sheets which vary in texture from\r\nfine dolerites at the outside into coarse gabbros further towards the\r\ncentral mass, and that this intrusion has been accompanied by a certain\r\namount of induration of the older rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 333.--View of the crest of the Cuillin Hills,\r\nshowing the weathering of the gabbro along its joints, and of a\r\ncompound basic dyke which rises through it. (From a photograph by Mr.\r\nAbraham, Keswick.)]\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side, the same structure can be even more distinctly\r\nseen, for it is not only exposed in gullies and steep declivities, but\r\ncan be traced outward into the basalt-plateau. In the promontory of\r\nStrathaird, Jurassic sandstones and shales, which form the coast-line\r\nand lower grounds, are surmounted by the bedded basalts. Denudation\r\nhas cut the plateau into two parts. The smaller of these makes the\r\noutlier that rises into Ben Meabost (1128 feet). The larger stretches\r\ncontinuously from Glen Scaladal and Strathaird House northward into\r\nBlath Bheinn. Hence from the ordinary terraced basalts, with their\r\namygdaloids, thin tuffs, red partings, and seams of lignite, every\r\nstep can be followed into the huge gabbro mountain. Starting from the\r\nblack Jurassic shales on which the lowest basalt lies, we walk over\r\nthe successive terraces up into the projecting ridge of An da Bheinn.\r\nBut as we ascend, sheets of dolerite and gabbro make their appearance\r\nbetween the basalts, which gradually assume the altered aspect already\r\nnoticed. The dip of the whole series is at a low angle northwards, and\r\nthe beds can be followed round the head of the Glen nan Leac into the\r\nsouthern slopes of Blath Bheinn. Seen from the eastern side of this\r\nvalley, the bedded character of that mountain is remarkably distinct,\r\nbut it becomes less marked towards the upper part of the ridge where\r\nthe gabbros preponderate. One of the most striking features of the\r\nlocality is the number and persistence of the dykes, which strike\r\nacross from the ordinary unaltered basalts of the plateau up into the\r\nhighest gabbros of the range. Where less durable than the intractable\r\ngabbro, they have weathered out on the face of the precipices, thereby\r\ncausing the vertical rifts and gashes and the deep notches on the crest\r\nthat form so marked a feature in the scenery. On the other hand, they\r\nare often less destructible than the plateau-basalts, and hence in the\r\nGlen nan Leac they may be seen projecting as low dams across the stream\r\nwhich throws itself over them in picturesque waterfalls. The youngest\r\ndykes in the Blath Bheinn group of hills, have been found by Mr. Harker\r\nto have a north-easterly trend, and a north-westerly hade of about 40°,\r\nand to give a stratified appearance to the gabbro when viewed from a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThe deep dark hollow of the Coire Uaigneich has been cut out of the\r\nvery core of Blath Bheinn, and lays bare the structure of the east part\r\nof the mountain in the most impressive as well as instructive way (Fig.\r\n334). By ascending into this recess from Loch Slapin, we pass over the\r\nwhole series of rocks, and can examine them in an almost continuous\r\nsection in the bed of the stream and on the bare rocky slopes on\r\neither side. Sandstones and shales of the Jurassic series extend up\r\nthe Allt na Dunaiche for nearly a mile, much veined with basalt and\r\nquartz-porphyry, by which the sandstones are locally indurated into\r\nquartzite. At last these strata are overlapped by the basalts of the\r\nStrathaird plateau, which with a marked inclination to N.N.W., here dip\r\ntowards the mountains. But by the time these rocks have reached the\r\nvalley, they have already lost their usual brown colour and crumbling\r\nsurfaces, and have assumed the indurated splintery character, though\r\nstill showing their amygdaloidal structure. They are much traversed\r\nby felsitic veins and strings which proceed from a broad band of\r\nfine-grained hornblende-granite that runs up the bottom of the Coire\r\nUaigneich and, ascending the col, crosses it south-westwards into the\r\nGlen nan Leac. On the left or south-eastern side of this intrusive\r\nmass, a portion of Lias shales and limestone (here and there altered\r\ninto white marble) is traceable for several hundred yards up the\r\nstream.[346]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 346: This limestone was formerly identified by me with the\r\nCambrian strata of the district. It was noticed by Von Oyenhausen and\r\nVon Dechen, who, as Mr. Harker has recently ascertained, correctly\r\nbelieved it to be a portion of the Lias torn off and carried upward by\r\nthe eruptive rocks (Karsten's _Archiv_, i. p. 79).]\r\n\r\nThe bedded basalts of Strathaird, after dipping down towards the\r\nN.N.W., bend up where they are interbanded with dolerites and gabbros,\r\nand form the prominence called An Stac, which rises as the eastern\r\nboundary of the Coire Uaigneich. Their steep dip away from the mountain\r\nis well seen from the east side, and their outward inclination is\r\ncontinued into the ridge to the southward. Similar rocks appear on the\r\nother flank of the band of granite, and form the base of Blath Bheinn.\r\nThey are likewise continued in the mountains further north called\r\nSgurr nan Each and Belig, where they dip in a northerly direction\r\naway from Blath Bheinn, which seems to be the centre of uprise, with\r\nthe gabbro-sheets dipping away from it. The bedded basalts have been\r\ntraced by Mr. Harker up to a height of well over 2000 feet on the Blath\r\nBheinn range. They are of the usual altered, indurated, and splintery\r\ncharacter. The intrusive sheets interposed between them become thicker\r\nand more abundant higher up, until they constitute the main mass of\r\nthe mountain. But that they are in separate sheets, and not in one\r\namorphous mass, can be recognized by the parallel lines that mark their\r\nboundaries. The junction of the gabbro sills and the lavas is a very\r\nirregular one, portions of the latter rocks being enveloped in the\r\nintrusive sills.\r\n\r\nThe granite which sends out veins into the surrounding rocks is\r\nobviously the youngest protrusion of the locality, except of course\r\nthe basalt-dykes which cross it, and which are nowhere seen in a more\r\nimposing display than round the flanks of Blath Bheinn. A section\r\nacross the corry shows the structure represented in Fig. 334.\r\n\r\nIt is thus demonstrable that when its line of junction with the\r\nsurrounding plateau-basalts is traced in some detail, the gabbro is\r\nfound to overlie them as a whole, but also to be intercalated with\r\nthem in innumerable beds, bands, or veins which rapidly die out as\r\nthey recede outwards from the main central mass; that these interposed\r\nbeds are intrusive sheets or sills from that mass which have cut off\r\nand enveloped portions of the basalts, and that the contiguous bedded\r\nbasalts show more or less marked metamorphism.\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the structure of the interior of the gabbro\r\narea of the Cuillin Hills. The first impression of the geologist\r\nwho visits that wild district is that the main mass of rock is as\r\nthoroughly amorphous as a core of granite. Yet a little further\r\nexamination will reveal to him many varieties of texture, sometimes\r\ngraduating into, sometimes sharply marked off from, each other, and\r\nsuggesting that the rock is not the product of one single protrusion.\r\nHe will notice further indications of successive discharges or\r\nextravasations of crystalline material during probably a protracted\r\nperiod of time, and in the intricate network of veins crossing each\r\nother and the general body of the rock in every direction, as well as\r\nin the system of basalt-dykes that traverse all the other rocks, he\r\nwill recognize the completion of the evidence of repeated renewals of\r\nsubterranean energy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 334.--Section across the Coire Uaigneich, Skye.\r\n\r\n  _a_, _b_, Jurassic sandstones and shales; _c_ _c_, bedded basalts\r\n  and dolerites; _d_ _d_, gabbros and dolerites with indurated\r\n  basalts; _e_, fine-grained hornblende-granite sending veins into\r\n  surrounding rocks; _f_ _f_, basalt-dykes running through all the\r\n  other rocks.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut the observer will be struck with the absence of the more usual\r\nproofs of volcanic activity in such forms as vesicular lavas and\r\nabundant masses of slag, bombs and tuffs, which are commonly associated\r\nwith the idea of the centre of a volcanic orifice, though he will meet\r\nwith isolated masses of coarse volcanic agglomerate within the gabbro\r\narea and along some parts of its junction with the granophyre. The\r\ngeneral characters of the rocks around him suggest that he stands, as\r\nit were, far beneath that upper part of the earth's crust which is\r\nfamiliar to us in the phenomena of modern volcanoes; that he has been\r\nadmitted into the heart of one of the deeper layers, where he can study\r\nthe operations that go on at the very roots of an active vent.\r\n\r\nWhen the geologist begins a more leisurely and systematic examination\r\nof the interior of the gabbro area of Skye he soon sees reason to\r\nmodify the impression he may at first have received that this rugged\r\nregion presents the characters of one single eruptive mass. The more\r\nhe climbs among the hills the more will he meet with evidence of\r\nlong-continued and oft-repeated extravasation, one portion having\r\nsolidified before another broke through it, and both having been\r\nsubsequently disrupted by still later protrusions.\r\n\r\nBut if by chance he should begin his examination of the ground upon\r\nsome of the more typically banded varieties of rock, he may for a time\r\nalmost refuse to admit that these can be either of volcanic origin or\r\nof Tertiary age.[347] He will find among them such startling counterparts\r\nof the structure of the ancient Lewisian gneiss of the North-West\r\nof Scotland that he may well be pardoned if for a time he seeks for\r\nevidence that they really do belong to that primeval formation, and\r\nhave only been accidentally involved among the Tertiary volcanic rocks.\r\nIf, for instance, he should land in Loch Scavaig, and first set foot\r\nupon the gabbros as they appear around Loch Coruisk, he would find\r\nhimself upon masses of grey coarsely crystalline, rudely banded rock,\r\nlike much of the old gneiss of Sutherland and Ross. Ascending over\r\nthe ice-worn domes, he would notice that the banding becomes here and\r\nthere more definitely marked by strong differences in texture and\r\ncolour, while elsewhere it disappears and is replaced by a granitoid\r\narrangement of the crystals, which are often as large as walnuts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 347: See _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. l. pp. 217, 657, and a\r\npaper by the author, \"Sur la Structure rubannée des plus anciens Gneiss\r\net des Gabbros Tertiaires,\" _Compt. rend. Cong. Géol. Internat._ 1894,\r\np. 139.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 335.--Banded and puckered gabbro, Druim an Eidhne,\r\nGlen Sligachan, Skye.]\r\n\r\nNowhere is the gneissoid banding more beautifully developed than on\r\nthe east side of the Cuillin group near the head of Glen Sligachan\r\nalong the ridge of Druim an Eidhne. It was at this locality that the\r\nfour typical structures were observed which have already been referred\r\nto (p. 329). The varieties of colour and composition depend upon the\r\nexceedingly irregular distribution of the component minerals. The\r\npaler bands, rich in felspar, lie parallel with dark brown bands full\r\nof pyroxene, olivine and magnetite, in which, moreover, thin ribs of\r\nglistening black consist in large part of the iron ore. These layers\r\nvary in thickness from mere pasteboard-like laminæ to beds a yard\r\nor more in thickness. Within a space of a few square yards their\r\nparallelism reminds one of stratified deposits (Fig. 336), but traced\r\nover a wider space they are found to be more or less irregular in\r\nthickness and lenticular in form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 336.--Banded structure in the Gabbro, from the\r\nridge of Druim an Eidhne between Loch Coruisk and Glen Sligachan.]\r\n\r\nThe resemblance to gneisses, and sometimes to the flow-structure of\r\ncoarse rhyolites, is still further sustained by occasional undulations\r\nor minute puckerings (Fig. 335). Still more extraordinary are the\r\nexamples of the actual plication of a group of successive bands, as\r\nshown in Fig. 337, wherein such a group about ten feet thick is shown\r\nto have been doubly folded between parallel bands above and below. This\r\nstructure is not due to any deformation of the gabbro long subsequent\r\nto the consolidation of the mass. It belongs to the phenomena of\r\nprotrusion and solidification. An examination of thin slices of\r\nthese rocks under the microscope reveals no evidence of crushing. On\r\nthe contrary, the minerals of one band interlock with those of the\r\nband adjoining, in such a manner as to prove that the differences of\r\ncomposition cannot be due to crushing and shearing or to successive\r\nintrusion, but must have been present before the final consolidation of\r\nthe whole rock.[348]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 348: Mr. J. J. H. Teall and A. G., _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._\r\nvol. 1. (1894), p. 652.]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion which seems most consonant with the facts is that the\r\nmagma which supplied the visible masses of gabbro in Skye existed\r\nbelow in a heterogeneous condition, that portions of it, differing\r\nconsiderably from each other in composition, were simultaneously\r\nintruded, and that by the deformation of these portions during\r\ntheir intrusion their present plicated structures were produced. A\r\ncareful study of these banded gabbros offers many suggestive points\r\nof comparison with the gneisses and anorthosite (Norian) rocks of\r\npre-Cambrian age. It seems in the highest degree probable that the\r\nbanded structures and peculiar mineral aggregation in these ancient\r\nrocks arose under conditions closely analogous to, if not identical\r\nwith, those in which the Tertiary gabbros of Skye originated.[349]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 349: Consult the Memoirs cited in the footnote on p. 342.]\r\n\r\nSimilar structures are found to be widely developed through the gabbros\r\nof the Cuillin Hills. Not only are these rocks disposed in distinct\r\nbeds, but many of the beds display the most perfect banding. Thus\r\nthe mountains that surround the head of Loch Scavaig and sweep round\r\nLoch Coruisk up to the great splintered crests of Sgurr na Banachdich\r\ndisplay on their bare black crags a distinct bedded structure. On the\r\neast side of Loch Scavaig the rock presents a rudely-banded character,\r\nthe bands or beds being piled over each other from the sea-level up\r\nto the summits of the rugged precipices, and dipping into the hill\r\nat angles of 25° to 35°. Abundant dykes and veins of various basic,\r\nintermediate and acid rocks cut this structure. The individual layers\r\nhere show sometimes the wavy and puckered condition already referred to.\r\n\r\nEven from a distance the alternating lighter and darker bands can\r\nreadily be seen, so that this structure, with the variations in\r\nits inclination, can be followed from hill to hill (Fig. 338). The\r\nregularity of the arrangement, however, is often less pronounced on\r\ncloser inspection. While the gabbro is rudely disposed in thick beds,\r\nindicative of different intrusive sheets or sills, with which the\r\nbanding is generally parallel, considerable irregularities may be\r\nobserved in the arrangement of the structure of individual sheets.\r\nThese sheets may be parallel to each other, and yet, while in some the\r\nbanding is tolerably regular in the direction of the planes of the\r\nsheets, in others it is much twisted or inclined at various angles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 337.--Banded and doubly-folded Gabbro, Druim an\r\nEidhne, 10 feet broad.]\r\n\r\nOn the west side of the Coruisk river the banding is vertical;\r\nsouthward from that stream it inclines slightly towards the south, but\r\nsoon again becomes vertical, and continues conspicuously so at the\r\njunction of the gabbro with the Torridon sandstones and plateau-basalts\r\non the west side of Loch Scavaig.\r\n\r\nThus, instead of being one great eruptive boss, the gabbro of this\r\ndistrict is in reality an exceedingly complicated network of sills,\r\nveins and dykes. While the general inclination of the bedding sometimes\r\ncontinues uniform in direction and amount from one ridge to another,\r\nit is apt to change rapidly, as if the complex assemblage of intruded\r\nmasses had been disrupted and had subsided in different directions. For\r\nexample, after overlying the bedded basalts of the plateau all the way\r\nfrom Glen Brittle to the west side of Loch Scavaig, the gabbro descends\r\nabruptly across these basalts and also across the Torridon sandstones,\r\non which they unconformably rest. These two groups of rocks are not\r\nonly truncated by the gabbro, but are traversed by the intricate system\r\nof sills, dykes and veins already referred to. Where it abuts against\r\nthe sandstones and basalts in Loch Scavaig, the gabbro is arranged in\r\nvertical bands of different mineral composition and texture. Much of it\r\nis remarkably coarse, some bands displaying pyroxene crystals more than\r\nan inch in length. There is no fine-grained selvage here, indicative\r\nof more rapid cooling. So coarse, indeed, is the rock close up against\r\nthe sandstone, that the junction-line can hardly be supposed to be the\r\nnormal contact of the intrusive rock. This inference is confirmed by\r\nthe existence of a singular kind of breccia between the gabbro and the\r\nsandstones. It is a tumultuous mass of fragments of coarse and fine\r\ngabbro, Torridon sandstone and shale, and plateau-basalts, embedded\r\nin a pale crystalline matrix of fine granular granophyre; veins from\r\nthis acid intrusion run off into the gabbro on the one side as well\r\nas into the Torridon sandstones on the other. It would seem that this\r\njunction-line has been one of great movement, that the gabbro-sheets\r\nhave subsided against a fault-wall of plateau-basalt and Torridon\r\nsandstone, and that subsequently an intrusion of finely granular\r\ngranophyre has come up the fissure, involving in its ascent fragments\r\nof all the materials around.\r\n\r\nThe rocks for a considerable distance to the south of the gabbro are\r\nintensely altered. The Torridon sandstone has been so indurated as to\r\npass into a bleached white quartzite, while the shales interstratified\r\nwith it have been converted into a kind of porcellanite. But the\r\nmost interesting alterations are those to be observed in the\r\nplateau-basalts, which at a height of about 300 feet above the sea,\r\nare to be seen in nearly horizontal sheets that lie immediately on the\r\nupturned edges of the Torridon sandstones. These lavas have suffered\r\ngreat metamorphism, to which more particular reference will be made in\r\nChapter xlvi. in connection with the action of the granophyre. Whether\r\nthis alteration has been produced by the intrusion of the gabbro or of\r\nsome concealed mass of granophyre underneath, of which only projecting\r\ndykes and veins reach the surface, must remain a matter of doubt. On\r\nthe whole, as the gabbro is here undoubtedly thrown against the basalts\r\nand Torridon sandstone by a fault, it seems most probable that the\r\nchange has been mainly due to the influence of the acid rock.\r\n\r\nIn the Blath Bheinn group of hills the relations of the gabbro to the\r\nbedded basalts have recently been mapped in detail by Mr. Harker during\r\nthe progress of the Geological Survey of Skye. He has observed that,\r\nallowing for irregularities of form, the mass of gabbro obliquely\r\noverlies the basalts as a great sheet, not necessarily due to a\r\nsingle intrusion, which dips towards the west. He has found the rock\r\nto vary from a coarse gabbro to a diabasic type, and to vary also in\r\nmineralogical constitution, becoming in places very rich in olivine,\r\nthough the banded structure is here only exceptionally developed. North\r\nof Garbh Bheinn the gabbro is much crushed and the outlying patch to\r\nthe north of Belig is in part a crush-breccia. Mr. Harker remarks that\r\nsimilar brecciated structures are common among the granophyres of the\r\nRed Hills, and that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish their\r\nstructure from that of the true volcanic agglomerates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 338.--Sketch of Banded Structure in the Gabbros of\r\nthe hills at the head of Loch Scavaig.]\r\n\r\nBesides the main area of gabbro in Skye, a great many small detached\r\nbosses, sills and dykes lie further east on the flanks of the Red\r\nHills. One of the best marked of these detached areas forms a\r\nconspicuous crag on the east side of Strath More, immediately to the\r\nnorth of Beinn na Cro. It consists of beds of coarse gabbro, with\r\nothers of dolerite intercalated in an outlier of the plateau-basalts,\r\nand is traversed by veins from the granophyre of the glen, as well as\r\nby the usual north-west basalt dykes (Fig. 349). It appears to be a\r\nmarginal portion of the main gabbro area separated by the intrusion of\r\nthe great granitoid boss of the Red Hills. On the north-eastern side\r\nof Beinn na Caillich numerous intrusive sheets of gabbro and dolerite\r\ntraverse the quartzite and limestone, and extend down to the sea-margin\r\nin the Sound of Scalpa.\r\n\r\nThere is an important feature in the main gabbro area of Skye not yet\r\nclearly understood, and which only a minute and patient survey can\r\nelucidate. Though I have found among the Cuillin Hills no distinct\r\nproof that the mass of gabbro ever gave rise to discharges of material,\r\neither lava-form or fragmentary, which reached the surface, the\r\ngabbro area, as already remarked, contains unquestionable evidence\r\nof explosions and the production of pyroclastic masses. Among the\r\nmoraine-mounds of Harta Corry, blocks of basalt-agglomerate are strewn\r\nabout, full of angular fragments of altered basalt, sometimes highly\r\namygdaloidal, and also boulders in which lumps of coarse gabbro are\r\nenveloped in a matrix of finer material. I did not find the parent\r\nrocks from which these glacier-borne masses had been derived, but there\r\ncan be no doubt that they exist among the gabbro crags that surround\r\nthat deep glen. Reference has already been made to the similar rock\r\nfound _in situ_ on the opposite side of the Cuillin ridge at the head\r\nof the great cauldron of Corry na Creich; likewise to the mass of\r\ncoarse agglomerate which forms a group of knolls and crags on the east\r\nside of Druim an Eidhne above the head of Glen Sligachan. This rock\r\ncontains abundant blocks of various slaggy lavas like those of the\r\nbasalt-plateau, and runs for some distance along the eastern limit of\r\nthe gabbro, between that rock and the granophyre. It is intersected by\r\nnumerous basalt-veins. Mr. Harker, as above mentioned, has recently\r\nfound some considerable strips of agglomerate which, like that which I\r\ntraced round the west side of Beinn Dearg, are interposed between the\r\ngabbro and the bosses of granophyre, or lie at the base of the volcanic\r\nseries (p. 284).\r\n\r\nThere does not, however, appear to be any evidence to connect these\r\nisolated masses of agglomerate with the phenomena attending the uprise\r\nof the gabbro. They seem to be more probably related to the plateau\r\neruptions, and may be compared with those of Strath, Ardnamurchan and\r\nMull (pp. 278, 280, 384). That the huge gabbro mass of Skye, besides\r\ninvading and altering the bedded basalts, may have communicated\r\neventually with the surface, and have given rise to superficial\r\ndischarges, is not at all improbable, but of any such outflows not\r\na vestige appears now to remain. We must remember, however, that\r\nthe gabbro no doubt in many places found its readiest upward ascent\r\nin vents belonging to the plateau-period, and that portions of the\r\nagglomerates of these earlier vents may be expected to be found\r\ninvolved in it, as the agglomerate of the great vent of Strath has been\r\ninvaded by the granophyre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\n       THE BOSSES AND SHEETS OF GABBRO IN THE DISTRICTS OF RUM,\r\n   ARDNAMURCHAN, MULL, ST. KILDA AND NORTH-EAST IRELAND. HISTORY OF\r\n                         THE GABBRO INTRUSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _The Island of Rum_\r\n\r\nThe mountains of the island of Rum, rising as they do from a wide\r\nexpanse of open sea, present one of the most prominent and picturesque\r\noutlines in the West Highlands (Map VI.). More inaccessible than\r\nmost of the other parts of the volcanic region, they have been less\r\nvisited by geologists. They were described by Macculloch as composed\r\nof varieties of \"augite rock.\" He noticed in this rock \"a tendency\r\nto the same obscurely bedded disposition as is observed in other\r\nrocks of the trap family,\" and found at one place that it assumed \"a\r\nregularly bedded form, being disposed in thin horizontal strata, among\r\nwhich are interposed equally thin beds of a rock resembling basalt\r\nin its general characters.\"[350] Professor Judd repeats Macculloch's\r\nobservation, that \"the great masses of gabbro in Rum often exhibit that\r\npseudo-stratification so often observed in igneous rocks.\" He regards\r\nthese masses, like those of Skye and Mull, as representing the core\r\nof a volcano from which the superficial discharges have been entirely\r\nremoved, and he gives a section of the island in which the gabbro is\r\nrepresented as an amorphous boss sending veins into a surrounding mass\r\nof granite.[351] In a subsequent paper he gave an excellent detailed\r\naccount of the mineralogical composition of some of the remarkably\r\nvaried and beautiful basic rocks constituting the hills of Rum, but\r\nadded no further information regarding the geological structure of the\r\nisland.[352]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 350: _Western Islands_, i. p. 486.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 351: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xxx. p. 253.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 352: _Op. cit._ xli. (1885) p. 354. See also his paper in vol.\r\nxlii. of the same Journal.]\r\n\r\nEven from a distance of eight or ten miles, the hills of Rum are seen\r\nto be obviously built up of successive nearly horizontal tiers of rock.\r\nAs the summer tourist is carried past the island, in that wonderful\r\nmoving panorama revealed to him by the \"swift steamer\" of modern days,\r\nthese great dark cones remind him of colossal pyramids, and as the\r\never-varying lights and shadows reveal more prominently the alternate\r\nnearly level bars of crag and stripes of slope, the resemblance to\r\narchitectural forms stamps these hills with an individuality which\r\nstrikes his imagination and fixes itself in his memory. If choice or\r\nchance should give him a nearer view of the scene, he would not fail\r\nto notice that it is among the northern hills of the island that the\r\nbedded character is so conspicuous, and that it ceases to be prominent\r\nin the southern heights, though here and there, as in the upper part\r\nof Scuir na Gillean, it may in certain lights be detected even from\r\na distance. Crossing over from Eigg, he would recognize each of the\r\nfeatures represented in the sketch reproduced in Fig. 339. Along the\r\nshore, red sandstones rise in naked cliffs, from the top of which the\r\nground slopes upward in brown moors to the bare rocky declivities. A\r\ndeep valley (Glen Dibidil) is seen to run into the heart of the hills,\r\nbetween the bedded group to the north and the structureless group to\r\nthe south. If the weather is favourable, some eight or more prominent\r\nparallel bars of rock may be counted on the two higher cones to the\r\nright. These bars are not quite level, but slope gently from right to\r\nleft. They remind one of the terraced basalts of the plateaux, but\r\npresent a massiveness and a breadth of intervening bare talus-slope\r\nsuch as are not usual among those rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 339.--Outline of the Hills of the Island of Rum,\r\nsketched from near the Isle of Eigg.]\r\n\r\nNor is this impression of regularity and bedded arrangement lessened\r\nwhen we actually climb the slopes of the hills. I had for years been\r\nfamiliar with the outlines of Rum as seen from a distance, and had\r\nsketched them from every side, but I shall never forget the surprise\r\nand pleasure when my first ascent of the cones revealed to me the\r\nmeaning of these parallel tiers of rock. I found it to be the structure\r\nof the Cuillin Hills repeated, but with some minor differences which\r\nare of interest, inasmuch as they enlarge our conceptions of the\r\nprocess by which the gabbro-bosses were formed.\r\n\r\nThe northern half of the island of Rum consists almost entirely of red\r\nsandstone, which, as already stated, is a continuation of the same\r\nformation (Torridonian) so well developed in the south-east of Skye,\r\nApplecross and Loch Torridon, and traceable between the Archæan gneiss\r\nand the Cambrian strata up as far as Cape Wrath. The sandstones, though\r\nfull of false bedding, show quite distinctly their true stratification,\r\nwhich is inclined with singular persistence towards W.N.W., at angles\r\naveraging from 15° to 20°. If they are not repeated by folds or faults,\r\nthey must reach in this island a thickness of some 10,000 feet. Their\r\nred or rather pinkish tint seems mainly to arise from the pink felspar\r\nso abundant in them, for in many places they really consist of a kind\r\nof arkose. Pebbly bands with rounded pieces of quartz are of common\r\noccurrence throughout the whole formation. Dykes and veins of basalt\r\nare profusely abundant. Sometimes these run with the bedding, and might\r\nat a distance be taken for dark layers among the pink sandstones. They\r\noften also strike obliquely up the face of the cliffs like ribbons.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding their apparent continuity, there can be no doubt\r\nthat these sandstones have suffered from those powerful terrestrial\r\ndisturbances which have affected all the older rocks of the North-West\r\nHighlands. On the west side, where they plunge steeply into the sea,\r\nthey have undergone a change into fine laminated rocks, which might at\r\nfirst be mistaken for shales, but which owe their fissility to shearing\r\nmovements. Along their southern border, from a point on the east coast\r\nnear Bagh-na-h-Uamha, south of Loch Scresort, to the head of Kilmory\r\nGlen, they are abruptly truncated against a group of dark, flaggy and\r\nfissile schists and fine quartzites or grits, which in some places are\r\nblack and massive like basalt, and in others are associated with coarse\r\ngrey gneiss. That some of these rocks are portions of the Lewisian\r\nseries can hardly be doubted, and their structure and relations are\r\nprobably repetitions of those between the Lewisian gneiss and Torridon\r\nsandstone of Sleat in Skye. I found also on the northern slopes of Glen\r\nDibidil a patch of much altered grey and white limestone or marble,\r\nwhich reminded me of the Cambrian limestone of Skye. The red sandstones\r\nin a more or less altered condition are prolonged to the south-east\r\npromontory of the island.\r\n\r\nIn passing over the zone of these more ancient rocks, we find them\r\nto present increasing signs of alteration as they are traced up the\r\nslopes towards the great central mass of erupted material. The pink\r\nsandstones gradually lose their characteristic tint, and grow much\r\nharder and more compact, while the veins and dykes of basalt and sheets\r\nof dolerite intersecting them increase in number. The zone of black\r\ncompact quartzite, which lies to the south of the sandstones, and which\r\nat one point reminds us of basalt, at another of the flinty slate of\r\nthe schistose series, likewise displays increasing induration. Its\r\nbedding, not always to be detected, is often vertical and crumpled.\r\nBut the most remarkable point in its structure is the intercalation in\r\nit of bands of breccia. These vary from less than an inch to several\r\nyards in diameter; they run mostly with the bedding, but occasionally\r\nacross it. The stones in them are fragments of the surrounding rock\r\nembedded in a matrix of the same material, but also with pieces of a\r\nsomewhat coarser grit or quartzite. A band of coarse breccia forms\r\nthe southern limit of this zone along the northern base of Barkeval\r\nand Allival. In general character it resembles the thinner seams of\r\nthe same material just referred to. The matrix so closely agrees with\r\nthe black flinty quartzite, that but for the included stones it could\r\nhardly be distinguished; so greatly has the mass been indurated that\r\nthe stones seem to shade off into the rest of the rock. But here and\r\nthere its true brecciated nature is conspicuously revealed by prominent\r\nblocks of hardened sandstone. This band of breccia must in some places\r\nbe 150 or 200 feet broad. It has no distinct bedding, but seems to\r\nlie as a highly inclined bed dipping into the hill. It may possibly\r\nbe a crush-breccia belonging to a period earlier than the volcanic\r\neruptions. It is at once succeeded by a black flinty felsite like\r\nthat of Mull. The groundmass of this rock, so thickly powdered with\r\nmagnetite grains as to be almost opaque under the microscope, displays\r\ngood flow-structure round the turbid crystals of orthoclase and the\r\nclear granules of quartz. Further up the hill, the rock becomes lighter\r\nin colour and less flinty in texture--a change which is found to arise\r\nfrom more complete devitrification, the groundmass having become a\r\ncrystalline granular aggregate of quartz and felspar with scattered\r\nporphyritic crystals of these minerals (microgranite). In some places,\r\nthe felsite incloses fragments of other rocks. A specimen of this\r\nkind, taken from the head of Coire Dubh, shows under the microscope a\r\nbrown micro-felsitic groundmass, with crystals of felspar and augite,\r\ninclosing a piece of basalt, composed of fine laths of plagioclase,\r\nabundant magnetite and a smaller proportion of granules of augite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 340.--View of Allival, Rum, sketched from the base\r\nof the north-east side of the cone.]\r\n\r\nThis band of felsite and microgranite may be traced continuously from\r\nLoch Gainmich along the base of Barkeval and Allival, and similar\r\nrocks appear at intervals on the same line round the eastern base of\r\nthe hills. Immediately above this belt of felsitic protrusions comes\r\nthe great body of gabbro. It will be observed that here, as in Skye,\r\nthe base of the gabbro mass presents a horizon on which injections of\r\nacid rocks have been particularly abundant. Whether the breccias be\r\nregarded as the result of earlier rock-crushings, or as due to volcanic\r\nexplosions during the Tertiary period, they are evidently older than\r\nthe eruption of the gabbros. In that respect they may be compared\r\nwith the agglomerates through which the youngest eruptive bosses of\r\nSkye have made their way; but their component materials have been\r\nderived from the surrounding platform of ancient rocks, and not from\r\nsubterranean lavas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 341.--Section of foliated gabbros in the Tertiary\r\nvolcanic series of Allival, Rum.\r\n\r\n_a_, massive gabbro with rude lamination parallel to bedding, only seen\r\nin some weathered surfaces; _b_, laminated troctolite; _c_, massive\r\ncoarsely crystalline gabbro rudely laminated.]\r\n\r\nFor my present purpose, however, the chief point of importance is the\r\nstructure of the gabbro mass that springs from that platform into\r\nthe great conical hills of Rum. The accompanying sketch (Fig. 340)\r\nwill convey a better idea of this structure than a mere description.\r\nAt the base, immediately above the felsite just referred to, bedded\r\ndolerites make their appearance, much intersected with veins from\r\nthe siliceous rock. Veins and dykes of basalt also cut all the rocks\r\nhere, the newest being those which run in a north-west direction. The\r\nlowest sheets of dolerite are succeeded by overlying sills of coarser\r\ndolerites, gabbros, troctolites, etc., which are as regular in their\r\nthickness and continuity as the ordinary basalts of the plateaux. The\r\nband of light-coloured troctolite, in particular (Fig. 341), about 20\r\nto 30 feet thick, which has been already referred to for its remarkable\r\nlaminar structure, can be followed for some distance along the base\r\nof the hill as a marked projecting escarpment. This rock at once\r\narrests attention by its platy or fissile structure, parallel to the\r\nbedding-surfaces of the sheet. Indeed hand-specimens of it, as I have\r\nsaid, might readily pass for pieces of schistose limestone, especially\r\nif taken from the upper part. It consists of successive layers, which\r\non the weathered surface divide it into beds almost as regular as those\r\nof a flagstone, each bed being further separated into laminæ marked\r\noff by the darker and lighter tints of their mineral constituents. The\r\ndarker layers consist of olivine, and the lighter of plagioclase. This\r\nsegregation here and there takes the form of rounded masses, where the\r\nminerals are more indefinitely gathered together. The affinity of the\r\nrock with intrusive sheets is further displayed by the occurrence of\r\nabundant nut-like aggregates of pale green olivine. Examined under the\r\nmicroscope, flow-structure is admirably seen, the lath-shaped felspars\r\nbeing drawn out parallel to the planes of movement, and giving thereby\r\nthe peculiarly schistose structure which is so deceptive.\r\n\r\nThe massive and coarsely crystalline gabbros below and above this\r\ntroctolite are all more or less affected by the same laminar structure.\r\nSome of those in higher parts of the mountain are quite massive in\r\npart, but also include bands of lamination. Banding like that of the\r\nSkye gabbros is generally developed among them, the individual bands\r\nvarying from less than an inch to a foot or more in thickness. This\r\nstructure, like the lamination, is parallel to the general bedding of\r\nthe sheets. As in the Cuillin Hills, the bands differ from each other\r\nin the relative proportions of the constituent minerals, especially\r\nthe predominant pyroxene and olivine. The crystals or crystalline\r\naggregates are often from a quarter of an inch to an inch in diameter,\r\nand in these large forms are crowded together in certain bands.\r\nMagnetite, on the whole, is rather less conspicuous than in the Cuillin\r\ngabbro: at least, it is not so prominently aggregated in special\r\nlayers. In one or two instances I have observed curvature of the\r\nbanding, but no example so striking as that cited from the Cuillin area\r\n(Fig. 337).\r\n\r\nOn weathered surfaces, where the felspars decay into a creamy white\r\nand the ferro-magnesian minerals assume tints of green, brown and red,\r\nthe resemblance of the rocks to schists is striking. This external\r\nlikeness is combined with a tendency to split into thin plates parallel\r\nto the lamination, which still further increases their schistose\r\nappearance. Though less developed than in Skye, the banding appears\r\nto be of the same kind and origin; but in Rum it is combined with the\r\nremarkable lamination above mentioned, produced by the arrangement of\r\nthe component minerals with their longer axes parallel to the planes\r\nof bedding, as in flow-structure--a combination which I have not yet\r\nobserved in Skye.\r\n\r\nThe bedded arrangement of the gabbros of Rum, so conspicuous in\r\nthe great eastern cones (Figs. 339 and 340), is emphasized by the\r\nfact that some sheets, of a more durable kind, stand out boldly as\r\nprominent ribs, while the softer crumble into a kind of sand, which\r\nforms talus-slopes between the others. Alternations of this nature are\r\ncontinued up to the very top of the mountains. The beds are nearly\r\nflat, but dip slightly into the interior or towards the south-west.\r\nOn the west side of the island also, beyond Loch Sgathaig, a distinct\r\nbedding may be traced, the inclination being here once more inwards\r\nor to the east. But from Glen Harris and the base of Askival this\r\nstructure becomes less marked, and gradually disappears. There is thus\r\na central or southern more amorphous region, while round the margin\r\ntowards the north and east the rock appears in frequent alternating\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that in the broad features of their architecture the hills\r\nof Rum follow closely the plan shown in the Cuillin Hills of Skye. But,\r\nunfortunately, in the former island denudation has gone so far that\r\nno connection can be traced on the ground between the gabbros and the\r\nplateau-basalts. As already stated, the latter rocks have been almost\r\nentirely stripped off from the platform of sandstones and schists\r\nwhich they undoubtedly at one time covered, and the few outliers of\r\nthem that remain lie at some little distance from the margin of the\r\ngabbro area (_ante_, p. 216). Nevertheless, we are not without some\r\nindications of them underneath the gabbros. I have alluded to the\r\nbasalts that lie at the base of the eastern cones. As we follow the\r\nbottom of the gabbro southward round the flanks of the hills, dull\r\ncompact black shattery basalts, with a white crust, appear from under\r\nthe more crystalline sheets. These at once remind one of the altered\r\nbasalts of Skye and Mull. On the west side also, beds of basalt emerge\r\nfrom under the gabbro, but they have been so veined and indurated by\r\nthe granophyre of that district, that their relations to the gabbro\r\nare somewhat obscured. If we could restore the lost portions of the\r\nplateau, I believe we should find the gabbros of Rum resting on part of\r\nthe volcanic plateau, and some of the gabbro-beds prolonged as sills\r\nbetween the sheets of basalt.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _The Gabbro of Ardnamurchan_\r\n\r\nThe promontory of Ardnamurchan reveals as clearly as the flanks of\r\nthe Cuillin Hills, though in a less imposing way, the relations of\r\nthe gabbros to the plateau-basalts (Map VI.). From the southern shore\r\nat Kilchoan to the northern shore at Kilmory, bedded basalts, of the\r\nusual type, amygdaloidal and compact, weathering into brown soil, may\r\nbe followed along the eastern slopes of the hills, resting upon the\r\nschists and Jurassic series of western Argyleshire. These rocks are a\r\ncontinuation of those that cap the ridges further to the south-east and\r\ncross Loch Sunart into Morven. They dip westwards, and followed upwards\r\nin that direction, they soon present the usual marks of alteration.\r\nThey weather with a white crust and become indurated and splintery.\r\nSheets of dolerite with many veins and dykes of basalt run between and\r\nacross them. Bands of gabbro make their appearance, and these, as we\r\nadvance westwards, increase in number and in coarseness of grain until\r\nthis rock, in its rudely bedded form, constitutes practically the whole\r\nof the promontory from Meall nan Con to the light-house. Many admirable\r\nsections may be seen on the coast-cliffs and in the rugged interior,\r\nshowing the irregular bedding of the gabbro, and how prone this rock is\r\nto develop its component minerals in bands or ribbons, sometimes made\r\nup of large crystals, as in Skye, Rum and Mull.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _The Gabbro of Mull_\r\n\r\nIn the island of Mull, the conclusions to which the geology of the\r\nother volcanic districts leads us as to the position of the gabbros\r\nin the series of volcanic phenomena, are further confirmed. The first\r\ngeologist who appears to have observed the relation of these rocks\r\nin that island was Jameson, who classed them under the old name of\r\n\"greenstone,\" including in the same designation rocks now termed\r\ndolerites and gabbros. He ascended one of the hills above Loch Don,\r\nprobably Mainnir nam Fiadh (2483 feet), which he found to consist of\r\n\"strata of basalt and greenstone,\" with some basalt-breccia or tuff and\r\na capping of basalt. He speaks of the \"singular scorified-like aspect\"\r\nof the weathered greenstone--a description which applies to some of\r\nthe coarser gabbro bands of that locality. But he appears to have\r\nrecognized the general bedded arrangement of the rocks up even to the\r\nsummit of the hill.[353]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 353: _Mineralogy of the Scottish Isles_ i. p. 205.]\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until the visit of Professor Zirkel in 1868,\r\nthat the true petrographical characters of the gabbro of Mull were\r\nrecognized. This observer remarked that the rock is regularly\r\ninterstratified with the basalt.[354] Professor Judd, as already stated,\r\nhas supposed the gabbros to be the deep-seated portion of the masses\r\nwhich when poured out at the surface became the plateau-basalts, and he\r\nrepresents them in his map and sections of Mull as ramifying through\r\nthe granitic rocks.[355]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 354: _Zeitsch. Deutsch. Geol. Gesellsch._ xxiii. (1871) p. 58.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 355: _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ xxx. (1874).]\r\n\r\nIn Mull the disposition of the gabbro in beds, sheets or sills is well\r\ndisplayed, for there is here no great central complicated mass of\r\ninterlacing banded and amorphous sheets. We have seen that a higher\r\ngroup of plateau-basalts has survived in this island better than in the\r\nother plateaux, and it would seem that denudation has not yet succeeded\r\nhere in cutting down so deeply into the gabbro core as in Skye, Rum\r\nand Ardnamurchan. Only the upper or outer fringe of intrusive sheets\r\namong the bedded basalts has been laid bare. The district within which\r\nthis fringe may be observed is tolerably well-defined by the difference\r\nof contour between the long terraced uplands of the ordinary basalts\r\nand the more conical forms of the southern group of gabbro hills\r\nbetween Loch na Keal and Loch Spelve. The number and thickness of the\r\ngabbro-sheets increase as we proceed inwards from the basalt-plateau.\r\nThese sheets are specially prominent along the higher parts of the\r\nridge that runs northwards from the northern end of Loch Spelve, and\r\nalong the west side of Glen Forsa. But they swell out into the thickest\r\nmass in the south-western part of the hilly ground, where, from above\r\nCraig, in Glenmore, they cross that valley, and form the rugged ridge\r\nthat rises into Ben Buy (2354 feet), and stretches eastward to near\r\nArdara (Map VI.). It is in this southern mass that the Mull gabbro\r\napproaches nearest in general characters to that of Skye. But even here\r\nits true intercalation above a great mass of bedded basalt may readily\r\nbe ascertained in any of the numerous ravines and rocky declivities.\r\n\r\nOne of the best lines of section for exhibiting the relations of\r\nthe rocks is the declivity to the west of Ben Buy and Loch Fhuaran.\r\nAscending from the west side, we walk over successive low escarpments\r\nand terraces of the plateau-basalts with a gentle inclination towards\r\nnorth-east or east. These rocks weather in the usual way, some into\r\na brown loam, others into spheroidal exfoliating masses. But as we\r\nadvance uphill they gradually assume the peculiar indurated shattery\r\ncharacter already referred to. The soft earthy amygdaloids become dull\r\nsplintery rocks, in which the amygdales are no longer sharply defined\r\nfrom the matrix, but rather seem to shade off into it, sometimes\r\nwith a border of interlacing fibres of epidote. The compact basalts\r\nhave undergone less change, but they too have become indurated, and\r\ngenerally assume a white or grey crust, and none of them weather out\r\ninto columnar forms. Strings and threads full of epidote run through\r\nmuch of these altered rocks. Abundant granophyric and felsitic veins\r\ntraverse them. Sheets of dolerite likewise make their appearance\r\nbetween the basalts, followed further up the slope by sheets of gabbro\r\nuntil the latter form the main body of the hill.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the same ridge similar evidence is obtainable,\r\nthough somewhat complicated by the injections of granophyric and\r\nfelsitic veins and bosses, to which more detailed reference will\r\nafterwards be made. But the altered basalts with their amygdaloidal\r\nbands and their intercalated basalt-tuffs and breccias, can be followed\r\nfrom the bottom of the glen up to a height of some 1700 feet, above\r\nwhich the main gabbro mass of Ben Buy sets in. Many minor sheets of\r\ndolerite and gabbro make their appearance along the side of the hill\r\nbefore the chief overlying body of the rock is reached. Some of these\r\ncan be distinctly seen breaking across or ending off between the bedded\r\nbasalts which here dip gently into the hill (Fig. 342). A conspicuous\r\nband of coarse basalt-agglomerate, containing blocks of compact and\r\namygdaloidal basalt a yard or more in diameter, shows by the excessive\r\ninduration of its dull-green matrix the general alteration which the\r\nrocks of the basalt-plateau have here undergone. An almost incredible\r\nnumber of veins of fine basalt, porphyry and felsite has been injected\r\ninto these rocks--a structure which is precisely a counterpart of what\r\noccurs under the main body of gabbro in Skye, Ardnamurchan and Rum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 342.--Altered Plateau-Basalts invaded by Gabbro, and with a\r\n  Dyke of prismatic Basalt cutting both rocks, north slope of Ben\r\n  Buy, Mull.\r\n\r\n_a_ _a_, amygdaloidal basalt, much altered; _b_, gabbro; _c_, finely\r\nprismatic basalt.]\r\n\r\nThe gabbro mass of the Ben Buy ridge is thus undoubtedly a huge\r\noverlying sheet, which probably reaches a thickness of at least 800\r\nfeet. It seems to descend rather across the bedding into the hollow of\r\nGlen More, and possibly its main pipe of supply lay in that direction.\r\nBeing enormously thicker than any other sheet in the island, it\r\nexhibits the crystalline peculiarities which are so well developed in\r\nthe central portions of the larger bosses of gabbro. It presents more\r\ncoarsely crystalline varieties than appear in the thinner sheets, some\r\nportions showing crystals of diallage and felspar upwards of an inch in\r\nlength. It likewise contains admirable examples of banded structure,\r\nwhich, as in Skye and elsewhere, is best developed where the texture\r\nbecomes especially coarse. Veins or bands, in which the constituent\r\nminerals have crystallized out in more definite and conspicuous forms,\r\nhere and there succeed each other so quickly as to impart a bedded or\r\nfoliated look to the body of rock, recalling, as in Skye, the aspect\r\nof some coarsely crystalline granitoid gneiss. In these respects the\r\nMull gabbro closely resembles that of the Cuillin Hills. Occasionally,\r\non the exposed faces of crags, portions of such bands or veins are\r\nseen to be detached and enveloped in a finer surrounding matrix. The\r\nthick belts or bands of coarser and finer texture alternate, and give\r\nan appearance of bedding to the mass. Nevertheless they are really\r\nintrusive sills, which run generally parallel with beds of finer\r\ngabbro or with sheets of highly indurated basalt, that may be detached\r\nportions of the ordinary rocks of the plateau. The thick sheet of Ben\r\nBuy, like the mass of the Cuillin Hills, is thus the result not of one\r\nbut of many uprises of gabbro.\r\n\r\nOf the thinner sheets of dolerite and gabbro in Mull little need here\r\nbe said. I have referred to their great abundance in the range of\r\neastern hills that rise from the Sound of Mull between Loch Spelve\r\nand Fishnish Bay. Though obviously intrusive, they lie on the whole\r\nparallel to the bedding of the basalts. The latter rocks exhibit the\r\nusual dull indurated shattery character which they assume where large\r\nbosses of gabbro have invaded them, and which gradually disappears as\r\nwe follow them down hill away from the intrusive sheets to the shores\r\nof the Sound. They dip towards the centre of the hill group, that is,\r\nto south-west in the ridge of Mainnir nam Fiadh, Dùn da Ghaoithe, and\r\nBeinn Meadhon, the angle increasing southwards to 15°-20°, and at the\r\nsouth end reaching as much as 35°-40°. Some fine crags of gabbro and\r\ndolerite form a prominent spur on the east side of the ridge of Ben\r\nTalaidh, in the upper part of Glen Forsa. These consist of successive\r\nsheets bedded with the basalts, and dipping south-west. A large sheet\r\nstands out conspicuously on the north front of Ben More, lying at the\r\nbase of the \"pale lavas,\" and immediately above the ordinary basalts.\r\nIt circles round the fine corry between Ben More and A'Chioch, some\r\nof its domes being there beautifully ice-worn. This is the highest\r\nplatform to which I have satisfactorily traced any of the intrusive\r\nsheets of Mull. Another dyke-like mass emerges from beneath the talus\r\nslopes of A'Chioch, on the southern side, and runs eastward across the\r\ncol between the Clachaig Glen and Loch Scridain.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _The Gabbros of St. Kilda and North-east Ireland_\r\n\r\nSixty miles to the westward of the Outer Hebrides lies the lonely\r\ngroup of islets of which St. Kilda is the chief. As the main feature\r\nof geological interest in this group is the relation of the acid\r\nprotrusions to the other rocks, the account of the geology will be\r\nmore appropriately given as a whole in Chapter xlvii. I need only\r\nremark here that the predominant rocks of these islands are dark basic\r\nmasses, chiefly varieties of gabbro, but including also dolerites and\r\nbasalts. Reasons will be afterwards brought forward for regarding\r\nthese rocks as parts of the Tertiary volcanic series. They present a\r\nclose parallel to the gabbros and associated rocks of Skye. But in one\r\nimportant respect they stand alone. No certain trace remains of any\r\nbasalt-plateau at St. Kilda such as those through which the gabbros of\r\nSkye, Mull and Ardnamurchan have been injected. In regard to their mode\r\nof production they have doubtless been intruded at some considerable\r\ndepth beneath the surface. But no relic appears to have survived of the\r\noverlying cover of rock under which they consolidated, and into which\r\nthey were injected.\r\n\r\nIn the remarkable volcanic district of the north-east of Ireland a\r\nseries of basic rocks appears, which in its mode of occurrence and its\r\nrelation to the other members of the series presents many points of\r\nresemblance to the gabbros of the Inner Hebrides. The Irish gabbros are\r\nwell developed in the Carlingford district, where they form intrusive\r\nbosses and sheets which have been erupted through the Palæozoic rocks\r\n(Map VII.). They are themselves pierced by later masses of granophyre\r\nand other acid rocks. Further reference will be made to these gabbros\r\nin later pages, where an account will be given of the granite masses of\r\nMourne, Barnavave and Slieve Gullion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe that, while in St. Kilda no relic of any\r\nbasaltic plateau has been preserved, in the Faroe Islands, on the\r\nother hand, no sign has been revealed by denudation that the volcanic\r\nplateau of that region is pierced by any eruptive core of gabbro or of\r\ngranophyre. During my cruises round these islands and through their\r\nchannels, I was ever on the outlook for any difference in topography\r\nthat might indicate the presence of some eruptive boss like the gabbro\r\nand granophyre masses of the Inner Hebrides. But nothing of that nature\r\ncould be discerned. Everywhere the long level lines of the bedded\r\nbasalts were seen mounting up to the crests of the ridges and the tops\r\nof the highest peaks. Though I cannot assert that no intrusions of\r\ngabbro or of granophyre exist among the Faroe Islands, I feel confident\r\nthat any such masses which may appear at the surface must be of quite\r\ninsignificant dimensions, and do not make the important feature in\r\ngeology and topography which they do among the Inner Hebrides. It is,\r\nof course, possible that, vast as the denudation of these islands has\r\nundoubtedly been, it has not yet trenched the plateau deeply enough\r\nto expose any great intrusive bosses and sills which may underlie and\r\ninvade the basalts.\r\n\r\n\r\niv. HISTORY OF THE GABBRO INTRUSIONS\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to draw, from the observations which have been\r\ngiven in this and the preceding chapter regarding the different areas\r\nof gabbro in the Tertiary volcanic region of Britain, some general\r\nconclusions with respect to the type of geological structure and the\r\nphases of volcanic energy which they illustrate.\r\n\r\n1. No evidence exists to show that the masses of gabbro ever\r\ncommunicated directly with the surface. They never exhibit the\r\ncellular, slaggy and other structures so characteristic of\r\nsurface-flows. They are, on the whole, free from included pyroclastic\r\nmaterial, though masses of agglomerate are enclosed in, and have\r\nprobably been invaded by, the gabbro of the Cuillin Hills. If the\r\ngabbro-bosses ever were continuous with sheets of rock emitted above\r\nground, all such upward continuations have been entirely removed. In\r\nany case, we may be quite certain that in an outburst at the surface,\r\nthe rock would not have appeared in the form of a coarsely crystalline\r\nor granitoid gabbro.\r\n\r\n2. The crystalline structures of the gabbros point unmistakably to\r\nslow cooling and consolidation at some depth beneath the surface. The\r\nmost coarsely-crystalline varieties, and those with the best developed\r\nbanded structure, occur in the largest bodies of rock, where the\r\ncooling and consolidation would be most prolonged.[356]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 356: On this subject, see the papers by Professor Judd already\r\ncited.]\r\n\r\n3. The remarkable differences in composition between the dark and pale\r\nlayers in the banded gabbros cannot be accounted for by segregation\r\nor successive intrusion, but seem to point to the existence of a\r\nheterogeneous magma from which these distinct varieties of material\r\nwere simultaneously intruded.\r\n\r\n4. From the prevalence of a bedded structure and the occurrence of\r\nbands and more irregular portions of considerably different texture and\r\neven mineralogical composition which intersect each other, it may be\r\nconfidently inferred that even what appears now as one continuous mass\r\nwas produced by more than one intrusion.\r\n\r\n5. In every case there would necessarily be one or more pipes up which\r\nthe igneous material rose. These channels might sometimes be wider\r\nparts of fissures, such as those filled by the dykes. In other places,\r\nthey may have been determined by older vents, which had served for the\r\nemission of the plateau-basalts and their pyroclastic accompaniments.\r\nThere can be no doubt that some of these vents afforded egress for the\r\nsubsequent eruption of granitoid rocks, as will be pointed out in the\r\nfollowing chapters. In the case of the gabbros, however, the position\r\nof the vents seems to have been generally concealed by the tendency\r\nof these rocks to spread out laterally. Denudation has cut deeply\r\ninto the gabbro-masses, but apparently not deep enough to isolate any\r\nof the pipes from the larger bodies of material which issued from\r\nthem, and thus to leave solitary necks like those in and around the\r\nbasalt-plateaux. In Skye, where the central core of gabbro is largest\r\nand most completely encircled, we cannot tell how much of it lies above\r\nthe true pipe or pipes, and has spread out on all sides from the centre\r\nof eruption. The prevalence of rude bedding and a banded structure\r\nindicate that most of the visible rock occurs in the form of sills,\r\nsuccessively injected not only into the plateau-basalts, but between\r\nand across each other. Round the margin of the gabbro we undoubtedly\r\nreach horizons below that rock, and see that it lies as a cake or\r\nseries of cakes upon the plateau-basalts. The actual pipe or fissure of\r\nsupply must in each case lie further inward, away from the margin, and\r\nmay be of comparatively small diameter.\r\n\r\n6. From the central pipe or group of pipes or fissures which rose\r\nfrom the platform of older rocks into the thick mass of the\r\nbasalt-plateaux, successive sheets of dolerite and gabbro were forced\r\noutward between the layers of basalt. This took place all round the\r\norifices of supply, on many different horizons, and doubtless at many\r\ndifferent times. In some cases, the intrusive sheets were injected\r\ninto the very bottom of the basalts, and even between these rocks\r\nand the older surface on which they rested. This is particularly\r\nthe case in Rum, where the gabbro-cones spring almost directly from\r\nthe ancient grits, schists and sandstones on which they rest. The\r\nintrusive sheets have likewise found egress at every higher platform\r\nin the basalt-series, up at least to the base of the \"pale group\" in\r\nMull--that is, through a continuous pile of more than 2000 feet of\r\nbedded basalt. But the intrusion did not proceed equally all round an\r\norifice. At all events, the progress of denudation has revealed that on\r\none side of a gabbro area the injected portions may occur on a lower\r\nstratigraphical level than they do on the opposite side. At the Cuillin\r\nHills, for example, the visible sheets of dolerite and gabbro to the\r\nnorth of Coire na Creiche begin about 1600 feet above the sea, which\r\nmust be much more than that distance above the bottom of the basalts.\r\nOn the south-east side, however, they come down to near the base of the\r\nbasalts at Loch Scavaig; that is to say, their lowest members lie at\r\nleast 1600 feet below those on the opposite margin.\r\n\r\n7. The uprise of so much igneous material in one or more funnels, and\r\nits injection between the beds of plateau-basalt, would necessarily\r\nelevate the surface of the ground immediately above, even if we\r\nbelieve that surface to have been eventually disrupted and superficial\r\ndischarges to have been established. If no disruption took place, then\r\nthe ground would probably be upraised into a smooth dome, the older\r\nlavas being bent up over the cone of injected gabbro until the portion\r\nof the plateau so pushed upward had risen some hundreds of feet above\r\nthe surrounding country. The amount of elevation, which would of course\r\nbe greatest at the centre of the dome, might be far from equable all\r\nround, one side being pushed up further or with a steeper slope than\r\nanother side. But even in the case of the Cuillin Hill area, it is\r\nconceivable that the total uplift produced at the surface a gentle\r\ninclination of no more than 8° or 10°.\r\n\r\nIt is along the periphery of a gabbro area that we may most hopefully\r\nsearch for traces of this uplift. But unfortunately it is just there\r\nthat the work of denudation has been most destructive. There appears\r\nalso to have been a general tendency to sagging subsequent to the\r\ngabbro protrusions, and the inward dip thereby produced has probably\r\nbeen instrumental in effacing at least the more gentle outward\r\ninclinations caused by the uprise of the eruptive rock. In one striking\r\nlocality, however, to which I have already referred, the effects\r\nof both movements are, I think, preserved. The basalt-plateau of\r\nStrathaird, which in its southern portion exhibits the ordinary nearly\r\nlevel bedding, dips in its northern part at an unusually steep angle\r\nto the north-west, towards the gabbro mass of Blath Bheinn. But before\r\nreaching that mountain the basalts, much interbanded with sheets of\r\ndolerite and gabbro, suddenly bend up to form the prominent eminence\r\nof An Stac, where they dip rapidly towards south-east and south (Fig.\r\n334). This steep dip away from the central mass of gabbro, is repeated\r\nin the hills to the north, where the beds are inclined to north-east,\r\nthe angle gradually lessening northwards till they are truncated by the\r\ngranophyre of Strathmore. The mass of Blath Bheinn thus occupies the\r\ncentre of the dome or anticline. The theoretical structure of one of\r\nthe gabbro bosses is represented in Fig. 343. It will be understood,\r\nhowever, that what for the sake of clearness is here represented in one\r\nuniform tint of black in reality consists of an exceedingly complex\r\nnetwork of sheets and dykes differing from each other in texture and\r\nstructure, as well as in the relative dates of their intrusion.\r\n\r\n8. The injection of so much igneous material among the bedded basalts\r\nhas induced in these rocks a certain amount of contact metamorphism.\r\nI have referred to it as showing itself in the field as a marked\r\ninduration, the rocks becoming closer grained, dull, splintery, and\r\nweathering, with a grey or white crust, while their amygdales lose\r\ntheir definite outlines, and epidote and calcite run in strings, veins\r\nand patches through many parts of the rocks. As already remarked,\r\nit is difficult to determine how much of this change should be\r\nreferred to the influence of the gabbro, and how much to that of the\r\nnumerous intrusions of granophyre which may be apophyses of much\r\nlarger bodies of that rock lying not far underneath. On account of\r\nthis difficulty, the more detailed description of the metamorphism\r\nof the plateau-basalts is reserved for Chapter xlvi., where it will\r\nfind a place in connection with the effects produced by the intruded\r\ngranophyres, which have undoubtedly been more extensive than those\r\neffected by the gabbros.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 343.--Theoretical representation of the structure\r\nof one of the Gabbro Bosses of the Inner Hebrides.\r\n\r\n_a_ _a_, platform of older rock on which the bedded basalts (_b_ _b_)\r\nhave been poured out; _c_, gabbro.]\r\n\r\nThe structure and history of the gabbro bosses of the Inner Hebrides\r\nfind a close parallel in those of the Henry Mountains of Southern Utah,\r\nso well described by Mr. G. K. Gilbert of the United States Geological\r\nSurvey.[357] In that fine group of mountains, rising to an extreme height\r\nof 5000 feet above the surrounding plateau, and 11,000 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, masses of trachyte have been injected between\r\nsedimentary strata belonging to the Jura-Triassic and Cretaceous\r\nsystems. These masses, thirty-six in number, have consolidated in\r\ndome-shaped bodies, termed by Mr. Gilbert \"laccolites,\" which have\r\narched up the overlying strata, sending sheets, veins and dykes into\r\nthem, and producing in them the phenomena of contact metamorphism.\r\nThere is no proof that any of these protrusions communicated with the\r\nsurface, and there is positive evidence that most if not all of them\r\ndid not. The progress of denudation has laid bare the inner structure\r\nof this remarkable type of hill, and yet has left records of every\r\nstage in its sculpture. In one place are seen only arching strata,\r\nthe process of erosion not having yet cut down through the dome of\r\nstratified rocks into the trachyte that was the cause of their uprise.\r\nIn another place, a few dykes pierce the arch; in a third, where a\r\ngreater depth has been bared away, a network of dykes and sheets is\r\nrevealed; in a fourth, the surface of the underlying \"laccolite\" is\r\nexposed; in a fifth, the laccolite, long uncovered, has been carved\r\ninto picturesque contours by the weather, and its original form is more\r\nor less destroyed.[358]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 357: See the remarks and diagram, _ante_, p. 86.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 358: \"Geology of the Henry Mountains,\" by Mr. G. K. Gilbert,\r\n_U.S. Geographical and Geological Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region_,\r\n1877.]\r\n\r\nThe gabbro \"laccolites\" of the West of Scotland belong to an older\r\ngeological period than those of Utah, and have, therefore, been longer\r\nsubject to the processes of denudation. They have been enormously\r\neroded. The overlying cover of basalt has been stripped off from\r\nthem, though from the escarpments beyond them it is not difficult in\r\nimagination to restore it. In Rum it has been so completely removed,\r\nthat only a few fragments remain at some distance from the core of\r\ngabbro, which now stands isolated. In Ardnamurchan, and still more\r\nin Skye, the surrounding plateau of basalt remains in contact with\r\nthe gabbro bosses. But in Mull, where the plateau-basalts reach now,\r\nand perhaps attained originally a greater thickness than anywhere\r\nelse, they have protected the intrusive sheets, which are therefore\r\nless deeply cut away than in any of the other districts, and no great\r\ncentral core of gabbro has yet been uncovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\n                            THE ACID ROCKS\r\n\r\n  Their Petrography--Their Stratigraphical Position and its\r\n  Analogies in Central France\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to the examination of another distinct phase of volcanic\r\naction during Tertiary time in Britain. The igneous rocks that have\r\nbeen under consideration in the foregoing chapters, whether poured\r\nout at the surface or injected below ground, have been chiefly of\r\nbasic, partly indeed, like the peridotites, of ultra-basic character.\r\nSome, however, have shown an andesitic or intermediate composition.\r\nReference has also been made to the probable eruption of acid rhyolites\r\nin the long interval between the outflow of the lower and the upper\r\nbasalts in Antrim. But we now encounter a great series, decidedly acid\r\nin composition, in the more largely crystalline members of which the\r\nexcess of silica is visible to the eye in the form of free quartz.\r\nWhile there is a strong contrast in chemical composition between this\r\nseries and the rocks hitherto under discussion, there are also marked\r\ndifferences in structure and mode of occurrence. Like the gabbros,\r\nall the masses of acid rock now visible appear to be intrusive. They\r\nhave been injected beneath the surface, and therefore record for us\r\nsubterranean rather than superficial manifestations of volcanic action.\r\n\r\nThe existence of rocks of this class in the midst of the basic\r\nmasses has long been recognized. They were noticed by Jameson, who\r\ndescribed the hills between Loch Sligachan and Broadford as composed\r\nof \"a compound of felspar and quartz, or what may be called a\r\ngranitel, with occasional veins of pitchstone.\"[359] Macculloch gave a\r\nfuller account of the same region, and classed the rocks as chiefly\r\n\"syenite\" and \"porphyry.\"[360] In Antrim, also, even in the midst of the\r\nbasalt-tableland, masses of \"pitchstone-porphyry \"pearlstone-porphyry,\"\r\n\"clay-porphyry,\" and \"greystone\" were observed and described.[361] In\r\nmore recent years Professor Zirkel has given a brief account of the\r\nso-called \"syenite and porphyry\" of Mull and Skye,[362] and the late\r\nProfessor Von Lasaulx fully described the \"trachyte\" or rhyolite of\r\nAntrim.[363]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 359: _Mineralogical Travels_, ii. 90.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 360: _Western Isles_, see the descriptions of Skye, Mull and\r\nRum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 361: Berger, _Trans. Geol Soc._ iii. (1816), p. 190; Portlock,\r\n_Journ. Geol. Soc. Ireland_, vol. i. (1834), p. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 362: _Zeitsch. Deutsch. Geol. Gesellsch._ xxiii. (1871), pp.\r\n54, 77, 84, 88.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 363: Tschermak's _Min. und Petrog. Mittheilungen_, 1878, p.\r\n412. The chemical composition of this rock and its place among the\r\nrhyolites had already been determined by E. T. Hardman from analysis,\r\n_Journ. Geol. Soc. Ireland_, vol. iii. (1871), p. 32.]\r\n\r\nThis interesting series of rocks embraces a greater variety of\r\npetrographical characters than any other portion of the British\r\nTertiary volcanic rocks. On the one hand, it presents thoroughly\r\nvitreous masses, some of which in their colour, lustre and microscopic\r\nstructure remind us of recent obsidians. On the other hand, it affords\r\ncoarsely crystalline compounds, to which no other name than granite\r\ncan be assigned, and which, did we not know their geological position,\r\nmight almost be classed with some of the most ancient eruptive rocks.\r\nBetween these two extremes abundant gradations may be found, including\r\nbeautiful spherulitic rocks, felsites and rhyolites.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with such a series of intrusive rocks, we again encounter\r\nthe difficulty of reaching certainty as to their relative dates of\r\neruption, since in each case all that can usually be affirmed is that\r\nthe intrusive mass is younger than that into which it is injected. It\r\nis quite possible that protrusions of acid rocks occurred at intervals\r\nduring the accumulation of the basic masses, as may perhaps be inferred\r\nfrom the rhyolite-tuffs and conglomerates of Antrim and from the\r\noccurrence of fragments of siliceous lavas in the gravels near the base\r\nof the basalt-plateau of Mull, and in the agglomerates of that island\r\nas well as of other districts.[364] It is probable, therefore, that at\r\nthe time when the basalts of the plateaux were emitted, there existed,\r\nwithin reach of volcanic explosions, masses of granophyric, felsitic\r\nor rhyolitic rocks, fragments from which were shot up the funnels of\r\ndischarge. That portions of these rocks were actually intruded into\r\nthe basalt-sheets before the building up of the plateaux was completed\r\nappears to be proved in Antrim. Elsewhere, however, no evidence has\r\nyet been obtained of any such intrusion until after the close of the\r\nplateau-period. On the contrary, in every case where the relative\r\nages of the rocks can be fixed, the acid are younger than the basic\r\nprotrusions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 364: Reference may also again be made to the agglomerates of\r\nStrath, Skye, which contain in some parts abundant fragments of acid\r\nrocks that closely resemble some of the masses of granophyre which\r\ndisrupt these agglomerates.]\r\n\r\nThe only known exceptions to this rule are the latest basalt-dykes.\r\nHence, while amid the large and varied series of acid rocks, which\r\nno doubt represents a wide interval of time, some may belong to\r\ncomparatively early epochs in the protracted volcanic period, the\r\nactual available evidence places the emission of these rocks, as a\r\nwhole, towards the end of the volcanic history. This evidence I shall\r\nbring, forward in full detail, since it necessitates an abandonment of\r\nwhat has been the general belief in regard to the relative ages of the\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. PETROGRAPHY OF THE ACID ROCKS\r\n\r\nThe classification of the rocks which best harmonizes the\r\nfield-evidence and the detailed study of their mineralogical\r\ncomposition, is one that arranges these volcanic protrusions into two\r\nseries. In the one, the orthoclase is sanidine, and the rocks range\r\nfrom the most vitreous pitchstone through perlitic and spherulitic\r\nvarieties to rhyolite (\"quartz-trachyte\"). In the other series, which\r\nembraces by far the largest proportion of the whole, the orthoclase is\r\nalways turbid, and in this respect as well as in many others the rocks\r\nremind us rather of ancient eruptive masses than of those which have\r\nappeared in Tertiary time. They range from flinty felsitic varieties,\r\nwhich are obviously devitrified glasses, through different textures of\r\nquartz-porphyry into granophyre, and finally into granite. As I have\r\nbeen unable to recognize any essential difference of structure and\r\ncomposition between these acid Tertiary rocks and those of far earlier\r\ngeological time, I give them the names which no petrographer would\r\nhesitate to apply to them if they were of Palæozoic age. It has long\r\nappeared to me that these rocks furnish conclusive evidence of the\r\nmisleading artificiality of any petrographical nomenclature in which\r\nrelative antiquity is made an essential element of discrimination.\r\n\r\n_Granite._--That true granites form part of the Tertiary volcanic\r\nseries of the British Isles has now been completely established. They\r\noccur as bosses and sills which have been intruded into the gabbros\r\nand all older rocks. They are thus proved not only to belong to the\r\nTertiary period, but to one of the latest phases of its volcanic\r\nhistory. But besides these granites, the relative age of which can be\r\ndefinitely fixed, there occur others which, standing alone and at some\r\ndistance from the basaltic plateaux, can only be inferentially classed\r\nin the Tertiary series. To this group belong the granite masses of the\r\nIsle of Arran and the Mourne Mountains in north-eastern Ireland.\r\n\r\nTaking first the unquestionably Tertiary granites which occur as\r\nbosses and intrusive sheets, we have to note that the more coarsely\r\ncrystalline granophyres are hardly to be distinguished externally from\r\ngranite. As the dark ferro-magnesian constituent of these rocks was\r\ngenerally believed to be hornblende, they were called by the older\r\npetrographers \"syenite\"; that is, granite with hornblende instead of\r\nmica. The peculiar micropegmatitic groundmass, which constitutes the\r\ndistinguishing feature of the granophyres, may occasionally be observed\r\nso reduced in amount as only to appear here and there between the\r\nother minerals, which are grouped in a granitic structure. From this\r\ncondition, one step further carries us into a true granite, from which\r\nall trace of the granophyric character has disappeared. Such gradations\r\nmay be traced even within short distances in the same boss of rock.\r\nThus, in the hornblende-biotite-granite boss of Beinn-an-Dubhaich,\r\nSkye, a thoroughly granitic arrangement of the component minerals is\r\nobservable in the centre, while a specimen taken from near the edge\r\non the shore of Camas Malag shows the development of a granophyric\r\ngroundmass. But, though the large bosses are usually somewhat coarsely\r\ncrystalline in the centre, and tend to assume finer felsitic textures\r\naround their borders, as was observed long ago by Oeynhausen and Von\r\nDechen,[365] the granitic structure is sometimes exhibited even at the\r\nvery edge, and not only so, but in the dykes that protrude from the\r\nbosses into the surrounding rocks. Thus the Beinn-an-Dubhaich mass, at\r\nits margin in Camas Malag, sends a vein into the surrounding limestone,\r\nbut though more close-grained than the main body of the rock, this vein\r\nis neither felsitic nor granophyric, but truly granitic in structure.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 365: Karsten's _Archiv_, i. p. 89.]\r\n\r\nSo far as I have observed, the true granites contain a brown mica and\r\nalso a little hornblende, both visible to the naked eye, but generally\r\nsomewhat decomposed. These rocks are thus hornblende-biotite-granites\r\n(amphibole-granitites of Rosenbusch). They may be defined as\r\nmedium-grained aggregates of quartz, orthoclase (also plagioclase),\r\nbiotite and hornblende, with sometimes magnetite, apatite, epidote and\r\nzircon. Dr. Hatch found that in some instances (Beinn-an-Dubhaich) the\r\nquartz contains minute inclusions (glass?), bearing immovable bubbles\r\nwith strongly-marked contours; while in others (Beinn-na-Chro, Skye)\r\nthis mineral is full of liquid inclusions with bubbles, sometimes\r\nvibratile, sometimes fixed. He remarked that the quartz and felspar\r\nhave consolidated almost simultaneously, but that in some instances\r\n(Marsco, Glen Sligachan) there are isolated roughly idiomorphic\r\ncrystals, of a white, less turbid orthoclase, which belong to a\r\nslightly earlier consolidation than that of the more kaolinized felspar\r\nof the rest of the rock.\r\n\r\nThe granite of the island of Arran, in the Birth of Clyde, which is\r\nhere included in the Tertiary volcanic series, has long been recognized\r\nas consisting of two distinct portions, an eastern or coarse-grained,\r\nand a western or fine-grained variety. The latter sends veins into the\r\nformer. These granites contain orthoclase, plagioclase, quartz and dark\r\nmica, the quartz being often idiomorphic with respect to the felspar,\r\nand a tendency towards a micropegmatitic structure being sometimes\r\nobservable. A distinguishing characteristic of the Arran granite is\r\nthe cavernous or drusy structure which it presents, the cavities being\r\noften lined with well-crystallized orthoclase and smoky quartz.[366] The\r\ngranite of the Mourne Mountains in Ireland closely resembles that of\r\nArran. Its druses, with their beautifully terminated minerals, have\r\nlong been well known.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 366: See Mr. Teall's _British Petrography_, p. 328.]\r\n\r\n_Microgranite._--This term is applied to certain intrusive masses,\r\nwhich megascopically may be classed with the quartz-porphyries\r\nand felsites, but which microscopically are found to possess a\r\nholocrystalline granitic groundmass of quartz and orthoclase, through\r\nwhich are scattered porphyritic crystals of the same two minerals,\r\nsometimes also with plagioclase, augite, magnetite or apatite. Rocks of\r\nthis type do not appear to be abundant. They occur as dykes and bosses,\r\nbut occasionally also as sheets. I have collected them from Skye, Rum\r\nand Ardnamurchan.\r\n\r\n_Granophyre._--Under this name may be grouped the large majority of\r\nthe acid rocks which play an important part in the geology of the West\r\nof Scotland. They are typically developed in the islands of Mull and\r\nSkye. Generally pale grey or buff in colour, they range in texture\r\nfrom the true granites, into which, as above stated, they graduate,\r\nto exceedingly close-grained varieties like the felsites of Palæozoic\r\nformations. In the great majority of them the micrographic intergrowth\r\nof quartz and felspar, known as micropegmatite, is their conspicuous\r\nstructure, and even constitutes most of their substance. They may\r\nthus be classed generally as granophyres, in the sense in which this\r\nterm is employed by Rosenbusch, but without his limitation of it to\r\npre-Tertiary rocks.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of these rocks has been determined from a series\r\nof specimens by Mr. A. Harker to range from about 2·3 among the\r\nfelsites to 2·7 among the granites. No chemical analyses of these rocks\r\nhave yet been made, but they have been subjected to microscopical\r\nexamination, and their general structure and composition are now known.\r\n\r\nThe typical granophyre of the Inner Hebrides outwardly closely\r\nresembles an ordinary granite of medium grain, in which the component\r\ndull felspar and clear quartz can be readily distinguished by the naked\r\neye. Throughout all the varieties of texture there is a strong tendency\r\nto the development of minute irregularly-shaped drusy (miarolitic)\r\ncavities, which here and there give a carious aspect to the rock.\r\nThat these cavities, however, are part of the original structure\r\nof the rock, and are not due to mere weathering, is shown by the\r\nwell-terminated crystals of quartz and felspar which project into them.\r\nOn a small scale, it is the same structure so characteristic of the\r\ngranite of the Mourne Mountains and of parts of that of Arran.\r\n\r\nExamined under the microscope, a normal specimen of the granophyre of\r\nthe Western Isles presents a holocrystalline groundmass, which fills\r\nall the interspaces between the crystals of earlier consolidation.\r\nThis groundmass consists of an aggregate of clear quartz and turbid\r\northoclase, arranged as micropegmatite, but also in more or less\r\nidiomorphic crystals. In some parts, the two dominant minerals are\r\ngrouped in alternate parallel fibres, diverging from the surface of the\r\nenclosed crystals, which are thus more or less completely surrounded by\r\na radially fibrous mass. The felspathic portion of the micropegmatite\r\nwhich usually surrounds the orthoclase crystals, when viewed between\r\ncrossed Nicols, is found to extinguish simultaneously with the central\r\ncrystal.[367] In other parts, the felspar forms a kind of network, the\r\nmeshes of which are filled up with quartz. Through the groundmass,\r\nbesides the clear quartz and dull orthoclase, some ferro-magnesian\r\nor other additional constituent is generally distributed, but\r\nusually somewhat decomposed. In certain varieties Dr. Hatch found an\r\nabundant brown mica, as in the rock at Camas Malag, Skye. In others,\r\na pyroxene occurs, which he observed in minute greenish grains,\r\nsometimes completely enclosed in the quartz. In a third variety, the\r\ndark constituent is hornblende, the most remarkable example of which\r\nis one to be seen at Ishriff, in the Glen More of Mull, where the\r\nferro-magnesian mineral takes the form of long dirty-green needles,\r\nconspicuous on a weathered surface of the rock. A fourth variety is\r\ndistinguished by containing plagioclase in addition to or instead of\r\northoclase. In the rock of the sheet forming Cnoc Carnach, near Heast,\r\nin Skye, Dr. Hatch observed both orthoclase and plagioclase scattered\r\nthrough a fine micropegmatitic groundmass, and in a part of the boss at\r\nIshriff he found the rock to be composed mainly of plagioclase, in a\r\nmicropegmatitic groundmass of quartz and felspar, with a few scattered\r\ngrains of a pale brown augite and grains of magnetite. A fifth variety\r\nis marked by the prominence of the crystals of quartz and felspar of\r\nearlier consolidation, and by the fineness of grain in the surrounding\r\nmicropegmatitic groundmass, whereby a distinct porphyritic structure\r\nis developed. Rocks of this kind are megascopically like ordinary\r\nquartz-porphyries. Still another variety has been detected by Mr. Teall\r\nin the rock of Meall Dearg, at the head of Glen Sligachan, Skye, in\r\nwhich, besides irregular patches which may represent decayed biotite,\r\nand others which are possibly ilmenite, the rare mineral riebeckite is\r\npresent.[368]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 367: Mr. Teall, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. 1. (1894) p.\r\n219. See also his _British Petrography_, p. 327.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 368: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. 1. (1894), p. 219.]\r\n\r\n_Felsite._--The close-grained rocks into which the ordinary granophyres\r\nfrequently graduate may be conveniently grouped under the general name\r\nof Felsite. They differ in no essential feature from the felsites of\r\nthe Palæozoic formations. They are more particularly developed, as\r\nmight be expected, in those places where the conditions have been most\r\nfavourable for rapid cooling, while the more coarsely crystalline\r\ngranophyres occur where the material may be supposed to have\r\nconsolidated most slowly. Where the acid magma has been injected into\r\nchinks and fissures so as to take the form of veins or dykes, it is\r\nsometimes felsitic, sometimes granophyric, in texture. Along the margin\r\nof large bosses, like those of Mull and Skye, it frequently though\r\nnot invariably has assumed a fine texture, with even spherulitic and\r\nflow-structures. But in the centre of large bosses it usually appears\r\nas coarse granophyre or as granite.\r\n\r\nThe felsites vary in texture from flinty or horny to dull\r\nfinely-granular, and in colour from white through shades of grey,\r\nbuff and lilac, to black, generally with porphyritic felspars and\r\nblebs of quartz. Where these porphyritic enclosures increase in size\r\nand number, the rocks cannot be distinguished externally from ancient\r\nquartz-porphyries. In general the groundmass of these rocks has been\r\ncompletely devitrified. But in some dykes enough of the glassy base\r\nremains to show their original vitreous condition. A gradation can thus\r\nbe traced from thoroughly glassy pitchstone into completely lithoid\r\nfelsites and crystalline granophyres.\r\n\r\nA characteristic feature of the felsitic varieties of acid rock is\r\ntheir flow-structure, which they often display in great perfection.\r\nSometimes, indeed, this structure has been so strongly developed as to\r\ncause the rock to weather along the planes of flow and to break up into\r\nthin slabs.\r\n\r\nMany of these rocks also present admirably developed spherulitic\r\nstructures, varying from microscopic minuteness up to large round or\r\negg-shaped balls nearly two inches in diameter, and often distributed\r\nin lines along those of flow-structure. They likewise exhibit a\r\nfrequent development of micropegmatite. No line indeed can be drawn\r\nbetween these felsites and the granitoid varieties, for the same\r\ncharacteristic granophyric intergrowth of felspar and quartz runs\r\nthrough them all.\r\n\r\n_Pitchstone._--This name is applied to the glassy varieties apart from\r\ntheir chemical composition, and specially denotes the possession of\r\na vitreous structure. Some of the rocks to which it has been applied\r\nare probably glassy varieties of andesite, others are dacites, while\r\nsome may be as acid as the most acid felsites and granophyres. The\r\npitchstones are found in veins or dykes which traverse different\r\ngeological formations up to and including the great granophyre bosses\r\nof the Inner Hebrides. They vary in colour from a deep jet-black or\r\nraven-black to a pale bottle-green, and in lustre from an almost\r\nglassy obsidian-like to a dull resinous aspect. Occasionally they\r\nassume a felsitic texture, owing to devitrification, and also a finely\r\nspherulitic structure. Some varieties appear to the naked eye to be\r\nperfectly homogeneous, others become porphyritic by the appearance of\r\nabundant sanidine crystals.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic structure of the British pitchstones has not yet been\r\nfully worked out. The beautiful feathery microlites of the Arran dykes,\r\nfirst made known by David Forbes, and subsequently described by Zirkel,\r\nAllport and others, are well known objects to geological collectors.\r\nDr. Hatch, in whose hands I placed my tolerably large collection of\r\nspecimens and their thin slides, furnished me with some preliminary\r\nnotes on the slides, from which the following generalized summary is\r\ncompiled.\r\n\r\nAt the one end of the pitchstone group we have a nearly pure glass,\r\nwith no microlites, and only a few scattered crystals of sanidine,\r\nquartz, augite or magetite. The glass in thin slices is almost\r\ncolourless, but generally inclines to yellow, sometimes to dark-grey.\r\nSome varieties of the rock are crowded with microlites, in others these\r\nbodies are gathered into groups, the glass between which is nearly\r\nfree from them. Among the minerals that have been observed in this\r\nmicrolitic form are sanidine, augite, hornblende (forming the beautiful\r\ngreen feathery or fern-like aggregates in the Arran pitchstones, Fig.\r\n3) and magnetite. Sometimes the rudimentary forms appear as globulites,\r\nor as belonites, but more commonly as dark trichites. Among the more\r\ndefinite mineral forms are grains of sanidine, quartz and augite. The\r\nporphyritic crystals are chiefly sanidine, augite and magnetite, but\r\nplagioclase occasionally occurs. The development of spherulites is well\r\nseen in a few of the slides, and occasionally perlitic structure makes\r\nits appearance.\r\n\r\nThe interesting rhyolitic areas of Antrim include several varieties of\r\npitchstone. One of these is described by Professor Cole as \"a glassy\r\npyroxene-rhyolite, on the verge of the rhyolitic andesites.\" Another is\r\na blue-black porphyritic obsidian.[369]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 369: _Scientif. Trans. Roy. Dublin Soc._ vol. vi. (ser. ii.)\r\n1896, p. 77.]\r\n\r\n_Rhyolite (Quartz-Trachyte)._--This rock has been abundantly erupted\r\nin north-east Ireland, where it rises in occasional bosses among the\r\nplateau-basalts.[370] It is best exposed at the Tardree and Carnearny\r\nHills, where it has long been quarried. Its petrographical characters\r\nat that locality were described by Von Lasaulx as those of a typical\r\nquartz-trachyte rich in tridymite, and containing large crystals\r\nof glassy sanidine, isolated narrow laths of plagioclase (probably\r\nandesine), grains of smoky-grey quartz, partly bounded by dihexahedral\r\nfaces, and a few scattered flakes of a dark-coloured mica. The\r\ngroundmass is microgranitic, and under a high power is resolvable\r\ninto a confused aggregate of minute microlites of felspar, with\r\ninterstitial quartz-granules.[371] More recently a detailed investigation\r\nof the petrography of the Antrim rhyolites has been conducted by\r\nProfessor Cole, who has called attention to their remarkable varieties\r\nof structure, ranging from perfect volcanic glass to a thoroughly\r\nlithoidal texture, and exhibiting flow, perlitic and spherulitic\r\nstructures.[372]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 370: Fragments of acid rock were detected by Prof. Cole in the\r\ngravel among the Ardtun basalt of Mull, as already noticed on p. 212.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 371: Tschermak's _Min. und Pet. Mittheil._ 1878, p. 412.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 372: _Scientif. Trans. Roy. Dublin Soc._ vol. vi. (ser. ii.)\r\n1896, p. 77. This paper gives an excellent account of the microscopical\r\ncharacter and mineralogical and chemical compositions of these rocks.]\r\n\r\nIntrusive masses of rhyolite are also found in the Carlingford region.\r\nOne of these, seen at Forkhill, is a velvet-black almost resinous rock\r\nwith abundant quartz and felspar, and sometimes displaying beautiful\r\nflow-structure. It will be more particularly described in Chapter\r\nxlvii. Some of the acid dykes and sills of the Inner Hebrides are\r\nvarieties of rhyolite. No undoubted example has yet been observed of a\r\nsuperficial rhyolite-lava, though such not improbably appeared in the\r\ninterval between the lower and upper basalts of Antrim.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. STRATIGRAPHICAL POSITION.--ANALOGIES FROM CENTRAL FRANCE\r\n\r\nIn the history of opinion regarding the relative position of the\r\nTertiary eruptive rocks, no feature is so remarkable as the universal\r\nacceptance of the misconception regarding the place of the acid\r\nprotrusions. In tracing this mistake to its source, we find that\r\nit probably arose from the fact that along their line of junction\r\nthe granitoid masses generally underlie the basic. This order of\r\nsuperposition, which would usually suffice to fix the age of two groups\r\nof stratified rocks, is obviously not of itself enough to settle the\r\nrelative epochs of two groups of intrusive rocks. Yet it has been\r\nassumed as adequate for this purpose, and hence what can be proved\r\nto be really the youngest has been placed as the oldest part of the\r\nTertiary volcanic series.\r\n\r\nMacculloch, who showed that his \"syenites\" and \"porphyries\" had invaded\r\nthe Secondary strata of the Inner Hebrides, and must therefore be of\r\nyounger date than these, left their relations to the other igneous\r\nrocks of the region in a curiously indefinite position. He was disposed\r\nto regard them all as merely parts of one great series; and seems to\r\nhave thought that they graduate into each other, and that any attempt\r\nto discriminate between them as to relative age is superfluous. Yet\r\nhe evidently felt that the contrasts of topography which he described\r\ncould hardly fail to raise the question of whether rocks so distinct\r\nin outward form did not differ also in relative antiquity. But he\r\ndismissed the question without answering it, remarking that if there\r\nis any difference of age between the two kinds of rock, \"there appears\r\nno great prospect of discovering it.\"[373] He records an instance of\r\na vein of \"syenite\" traversing the \"hypersthene rock\" in the valley\r\nof Coruisk. \"If this vein,\" he says, \"could be traced to the mass of\r\nsyenite, it might be held a sufficient ground of judgment, but under\r\nthe present circumstances it is incapable of affording any assistance\r\nin solving the difficulty.\"[374] Instead, however, of being a solitary\r\ninstance, it is only one of hundreds of similar intrusions which can be\r\nconnected with the general body of granitic and granophyric masses, and\r\nwhich put the relative ages of the several groups of rock beyond any\r\nfurther doubt.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 373: _Western Islands_, i. p. 368; see also pp. 488, 575, 578.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 374: _Op. cit._ p. 370.]\r\n\r\nBoué, who knew the geology of some of the extinct volcanic regions of\r\nEurope, recognized the similarity of the Scottish masses to those of\r\nthe Continent, and classed the acid rocks as \"trachytes.\" He saw in\r\neach of the volcanic areas of the West of Scotland a trachytic centre,\r\nand supposed that the more granitoid parts might represent the centres\r\nin the European trachytic masses. He traced in imagination the flow of\r\nthe lava-streams from these foci of volcanic activity, distinguishing\r\nthem as products of different epochs of eruption, among the last\r\nof which he thought that the trachytic porphyries might have been\r\ndischarged. He admitted, however, that his restoration could not be\r\nbased on the few available data without recourse to theoretical notions\r\ndrawn from the analogy of other regions.[375]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 375: _Essai Géologique sur l'Écosse_, pp. 291, 322, 327.]\r\n\r\nIn the careful exploration of the central region of Skye made by Von\r\nOeynhausen and Von Dechen, these able observers traced the boundary\r\nbetween the \"syenite\" and the \"hypersthene rock\"; and as they found\r\nthe former lying underneath the latter, they seem naturally to have\r\nconsidered it to be the older protrusion of the two.[376] Principal\r\nForbes came to a similar conclusion from the fact that he found the\r\ndark gabbro always overlying the light-coloured felspathic masses.[377]\r\nProfessor Zirkel also observed the same relative position, and adopted\r\nthe same inference as to the relative age of the rocks.[378] Professor\r\nJudd followed these writers in placing the acid rocks before the basic.\r\nHe supposed the granitoid masses to form the cores of volcanic piles\r\nprobably of Eocene age, through and over which the protrusions of\r\ngabbro and the eruptions of the plateau-basalts took place.[379]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 376: Karsten's _Archiv_, i. p. 82. It will be shown in later\r\npages that the apparent infraposition of the granophyre is often\r\ndeceptive, the real junction being vertical.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 377: _Edin. New Phil. Jour._ xl. (1846) p. 84.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 378: _Zeitsch. Deutsch. Geol. Gesellsch._ xxiii. (1871) pp. 90,\r\n95. He says that the gabbro seems to be the younger rock, so far as\r\ntheir relations to each other can be seen.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 379: _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ xxx. (1874) p. 255.]\r\n\r\nThe evidence for the posteriority of the acid rocks will be fully\r\ndetailed in later pages. Before entering upon its consideration,\r\nhowever, I would remark that the uprise of the British granophyres\r\npresents so many points of resemblance to that of the trachytes and\r\nphonolites among the basalt-plateaux of Auvergne and the Velay in\r\nCentral France, that a brief account of the acid protrusions of these\r\nregions may be suitably given here as an introduction to the account of\r\nthose of the Inner Hebrides. A succession of stages in the progress of\r\ndenudation allows us to follow the gradual isolation and dissection of\r\nthe French volcanic groups. The youngest examples occur in the chain of\r\ncones and craters, in the region of the Puy de Dôme. These may be of\r\nPleistocene, or even of more recent date. Older and more deeply eroded\r\nthan these are the numerous domes and cones in the territory of Haute\r\nLoire. Yet more ancient and still more stupendously denuded come the\r\nbosses, sills and dykes of Britain. Nevertheless, the geologist, by\r\nthe methods so admirably devised by Desmarest, may follow the chain of\r\nrelationship through these different regions and trace a remarkable\r\ncontinuity of structure. The younger rocks serve to illustrate the\r\noriginal condition of the more ancient, while the latter, by their\r\nextensive denudation, permit points of structure to be seen which in\r\nthe former are still concealed.\r\n\r\nNo feature in the interesting volcanic district of Auvergne has\r\nattracted more attention than the trachytic protrusions.[380] Rising\r\nconspicuously along the chain of puys, they claim notice even from\r\na distance owing to the topographical contrast which their pale\r\nrounded domes offer to the truncated, crater-bearing cones of dark\r\ncinders around them. They consist of masses of a pale variety of\r\ntrachyte (domite), which in ground-plan present a circular or somewhat\r\nelliptical outline. They vary in size from the nearly circular dome of\r\nthe Grand Sarcoui, which measures about 400 yards in diameter, to the\r\nlargest mass of all--that of the Puy de Dôme, which extends for some\r\n1500 yards from north to south with a breadth varying from 500 to 800\r\nyards. They are likewise prominent from their height; in the Puy de\r\nDôme they form the highest elevation of the whole region (1465 metres),\r\nand even in the less conspicuous hills they rise from 500 to 600 feet\r\nabove the surrounding plateau.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 380: The admirable Map and Memoirs of Desmarest on Auvergne\r\nare classics in geology. Scrope's work, vol. i. p. 45, gives still\r\nthe best published account of this district. See also the work of\r\nLecoq (_ibid._). The results of more detailed petrographical research\r\nregarding the rocks will be found in the essays of M. Michel Lévy\r\n(_Bull. Soc. Géol. France_, 1890, p. 688) and in the Clermont sheet of\r\nthe Geological Survey Map of France (Feuille, 166). A bibliography of\r\nthe district up to the year 1890 is given in the volume of the _Bull.\r\nSoc. Géol. France_ just cited, p. 674.]\r\n\r\nFive such dome-shaped protrusions of trachyte have made their\r\nappearance among the cinder-cones in a space of about five English\r\nmiles in length by about two miles in extreme breadth. Though opinions\r\nhave varied as to the mode of formation of these domes, there has been\r\na general agreement that their present topographic contours cannot be\r\nfar from the original outlines assumed by the masses at the time of\r\ntheir production. The position of the trachyte bosses among the puys\r\nserves to show that they were not deep-seated masses which have been\r\nentirely uncovered by denudation, but were essentially superficial,\r\nand were protruded to the surface at various points along the plateau\r\nin the midst of already existing cinder-cones. In some cases, they have\r\nrisen on or near the position of the vents of these cones. Thus the Puy\r\nde Chopine is half encircled by the crater of the Puy de la Goutte,\r\nand the Grand Sarcoui stands in a similar relation to the fragmentary\r\ncrater-wall of the Petit Sarcoui.\r\n\r\nM. Michel Lévy, in pointing out the superficial character of the\r\ndomitic protrusions, has forcibly dwelt on the evidence that these\r\nrocks have undergone a comparatively trifling denudation, and that\r\nthey could never have extended much beyond their present limits.[381] As\r\nScrope pointed out, they were obviously protruded in a pasty condition,\r\nnot flowing out in streams like the other lavas of the district, but\r\nconsolidating within their chimneys and rising from these in rounded\r\ndomes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 381: _Op. cit._ p. 711.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 344.--Section through the Puy de la Goutte and Puy\r\nde Chopine.\r\n\r\n1, Mica-schist; 2 2, Granite; 3 3, Tuffs; 4, Trachyte; 5, Basalt dyke.]\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly denudation, cannot have left them altogether unaffected,\r\nbut must have removed some amount of material from their surface.\r\nThere is reason to believe that the material so removed may have been\r\nin large part of a fragmental character, and that it was under a\r\ncovering of loose pyroclastic debris that the upward termination of the\r\ntrachyte column assumed its typical dome-form. Thus in the crater-wall\r\nof the Puy de la Goutte, layers of buff-coloured trachytic tuff dip\r\ngently away from the central domite mass of the Puy de Chopine. That\r\nthis material was thrown out from the vent previous to the uprise of\r\nthe domite may be inferred from the way in which the latter rock has\r\nobliterated the northern half of the crater. The relations of the rocks\r\nare somewhat obscured by talus and herbage, but when I last visited\r\nthe locality in the spring of 1895 the structure seemed to me to be as\r\nexpressed in the accompanying diagram (Fig. 344).[382]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 382: Compare M. Michel Lévy, _ibid._]\r\n\r\nThe relative date of the protrusion of the trachytic domes cannot\r\nbe very precisely defined. There can, indeed, be no doubt that it\r\nbelongs to a late phase of the volcanic history. It came long after the\r\noutpouring of the older basaltic plateaux, of which large fragments\r\nemerge from beyond the limits of the younger lavas on both sides of the\r\ngreat ridge of the puys, and not only long after that outpouring, but\r\neven after the widespread sheets of basalt had been deeply trenched by\r\nvalleys and isolated into outliers capping the hill-tops. Yet there is\r\ngood evidence also that the uprise of the comparatively acid trachytes\r\nwas not the last volcanic episode of the district. The abundance of\r\ndark slags and fragments of basalt lying on the domite hills shows that\r\ndischarges of more basic detritus occurred after these hills had taken\r\ntheir place in the landscape.\r\n\r\nSince the latest eruptions, a gradual alteration of the topographical\r\nfeatures by denudation has been slowly but continuously going on. The\r\nGrand Sarcoui, possibly from having originally had a considerable\r\ncovering of fragmentary material, shows least the effects of this\r\nwaste. Its remarkably regular form, like that of an inverted cauldron\r\n(the \"Chaudron,\" as it is called in the district), presents, in a\r\ndistant view, a smooth grassy surface which slopes steeply down into\r\nthe great volcanic plain. But on a nearer examination these declivities\r\nare found to be seamed with trenches which the rain-storms of centuries\r\nhave dug out. The covering of loose debris has been largely washed\r\naway, though many fragments of dark slag are still strewn over the\r\nslopes, and the scars are now being cut into the domite below. A more\r\nadvanced stage of decay may be seen on the Puy de Dôme, where, from\r\ngreater elevation and exposure, the domite is already deeply gashed\r\nby gullies and ravines, while the slopes below are strewn with its\r\ndetritus.\r\n\r\nThe region of the Velay displays on a far more extensive scale the\r\nprotrusion of trachytic and phonolitic bosses, but as its volcanic\r\nhistory goes back beyond the time of the Puys of Auvergne, its\r\nvolcanic monuments have consequently been more extensively affected\r\nby denudation.[383] A series of basaltic eruptions forming extensive\r\nsheets can there be traced, the oldest dating from Miocene time, the\r\nyoungest coming down to the age of the mammoth, cave-bear and early\r\nman. During this prolonged outpouring of basic lavas there were several\r\nintervals during which materials of a more acid nature--trachytes and\r\nphonolites--were erupted. These rocks occur partly as extensive tracts,\r\ncovering five or six square miles, like those of the Mezenc, the Megal,\r\nthe Pic de Lizieux, and the Rand, and partly in isolated conical or\r\ndome-shaped prominences, sometimes only a few hundred feet in diameter.\r\nUpwards of one hundred distinct eruptions of phonolite have been\r\nobserved in the Velay. Even in the tracts where they cover the largest\r\nspace, several prominent eminences may usually be observed, not unlike\r\nin general shape the isolated cones and domes of Auvergne. In these\r\nwider areas there appears to be evidence of the outcome of the lava\r\nfrom one or more vents, either as superficial streams or as underground\r\nintrusive sheets. M. Boule has expressed his opinion that most of the\r\nmasses of trachyte and phonolite have been the result of local and\r\nlimited eruptions, the pasty rock having risen in and accumulated\r\naround its pipe, without flowing far in any direction. A section across\r\none of these masses would present a somewhat mushroom-shaped form.[384]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 383: In addition to the work of Scrope, the student of this\r\nimportant volcanic district will find an invaluable guide in the Le\r\nPuy Sheet (No. 186) of the Geological Survey Map of France, and in the\r\n_Bulletins_ of the Survey, particularly those by MM. Termier and Boule,\r\nNo. 13 (1890) and No. 28 (1892).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 384: _Bull. Carte. Géol. France_, No. 28 (tome iv.) p. 125.]\r\n\r\nThat fragmentary ejections accompanied the protrusion of these rocks,\r\nthough probably on a very limited scale, is shown by the occasional\r\nsurvival of portions of trachyte tuff around them. One of the most\r\nnotable of these deposits occurs in the hollow between the Suc du\r\nPertuis and the next dome to the south. It consists of fine and coarse,\r\ntrachytic detritus, which in one place is rudely bedded and appears to\r\ndip away from the phonolite dome behind it at an angle of 30°. This\r\nmaterial and its inclination are what might be expected to occur round\r\nan eruptive vent, and may be compared with those of the crater-wall\r\nof the Puy de la Goutte in relation to the domite boss of the Puy de\r\nChopine.\r\n\r\nThe denudation of Velay has undoubtedly advanced considerably further\r\nthan that of the Puys of Auvergne. The pyroclastic material which may\r\nhave originally covered the domes of trachyte and phonolite has been\r\nin great part swept away. The surrounding rocks, too, both aqueous and\r\nigneous, have been extensively removed from around the necks of more\r\nenduring material. Hence the trachyte and phonolite bosses stand out\r\nwith so striking a prominence as to arrest the eye even for a distance\r\nof many miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 345.--View of the Huche Pointue and Huche Platte\r\nwest of Le Pertuis.\r\n\r\nThe cone is one of the trachytic domes, while the flat plateau to the\r\nleft is a denuded outlier of the basalt sheets.]\r\n\r\nThere cannot be any doubt that these necks have pierced the older\r\nbasalts, and therefore belong to a later epoch in the volcanic history.\r\nThe approximately horizontal sheets of basalt have been deeply eroded\r\nand reduced to mere fragments, and in some instances their existing\r\nportions owe their survival to the protection afforded to them by the\r\nimmense protrusions of more acid material. But there is here, as well\r\nas in Auvergne, evidence of the uprise of a later more basic magma, for\r\nsheets of basalt are found overlying some parts of the trachytes and\r\nphonolites.\r\n\r\nWhile the external forms of these Velay necks recall with singular\r\nvividness the features of many more ancient necks in Britain, an\r\nexamination of the internal structure of some of them affords some\r\nfurther interesting points of resemblance. The slabs into which, by\r\nmeans of weathering along the joints, the rock is apt to split up are\r\nsometimes arranged with a general dip outwards from the centre of the\r\nhill, so that their flat surfaces roughly coincide with the hillslopes.\r\nIn other cases the peculiar platy structure, so characteristic of\r\nphonolite, is disposed vertically or dips at a steep angle into the\r\nhill, so that the edges of the slabs are presented to the declivities,\r\nwhich consequently become more abrupt and rugged.\r\n\r\nThough none of the volcanic series in Auvergne or the Velay is so acid\r\nin composition as the more acid members of the Tertiary volcanic series\r\nof Britain, the manner in which the trachytes and phonolites of the\r\nFrench region make their appearance presents some suggestive analogies\r\nto that of the corresponding rocks in this country. We see that they\r\nwere erupted long after the outpouring of extensive basaltic plateaux,\r\nthat they belonged to successive epochs of volcanic activity, that they\r\nwere protruded in a pasty condition to the surface, where, more or less\r\ncovered with fragmentary ejections, they terminated in dome-shaped\r\nhills or spread out to a limited distance around the vents, and\r\nlastly, that they were succeeded by a still later series of more basic\r\neruptions, which completed the long volcanic history. We shall see in\r\nthe following pages how closely the various stages in this complex\r\nrecord of volcanic activity may be paralleled in the geological records\r\nof Tertiary time in Britain.[385]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 385: The phonolite necks of Bohemia, which form so prominent\r\na feature in the Tertiary geology of that country, might likewise be\r\ncited here in illustration of the acid domes and bosses of the British\r\nIsles.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\n             TYPES OF STRUCTURE IN THE ACID ROCKS--BOSSES\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning now to the consideration of the acid rocks as these manifest\r\nthemselves in the volcanic areas of Britain, I would remark that\r\nthree distinct types of structure may be noted among them, viz. (1)\r\nbosses, (2) sills or intrusive sheets, (3) veins and dykes. These\r\ntypes, as above remarked, belong entirely to the underground operations\r\nof volcanism, for though the rhyolitic fragments in the tuffs and\r\nagglomerates of the plateaux prove that acid lavas existed near the\r\nsurface, no undoubted case of superficial lava belonging to the acid\r\nseries has yet been observed.[386]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 386: The rhyolites of Tardree in Antrim have recently been\r\nclaimed by Professor Cole as true lavas grouped round an eruptive vent.\r\nFor reasons to be given in the next chapter I regard them as intrusive\r\nmasses, though they may not improbably have been connected with streams\r\nof lava now entirely removed.]\r\n\r\nThe bosses of acid material in the British Tertiary volcanic series\r\nare irregular protrusions, varying in size from knobs only a few\r\nsquare yards in area up to huge masses many square miles in extent,\r\nand comprising groups of lofty hills. As a rule, their outlines are\r\nmarkedly irregular. Beneath the surface they plunge down almost\r\nvertically through the rocks which they traverse, but in not a few\r\ninstances their boundaries are inclined to the horizon, so that the\r\ncontiguous rocks seem to rest against them, and sometimes lie in\r\noutliers on their sides and summits. From the margins of these bosses\r\napophyses are given off into the surrounding rocks, sometimes only\r\nrarely and at wide intervals, in other places in prodigious numbers.\r\nSometimes the acid material has been injected in thousands of veins and\r\nminute threads, which completely enclose fragments of the surrounding\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nThe rock of which the bosses consist is generally granophyric in\r\ntexture, passing on the one hand, particularly in the central parts,\r\ninto granite, and on the other, and especially towards the margin, into\r\nvarious more compact felsitic varieties, and sometimes exhibiting along\r\nthe outer edge more or less developed spherulitic and flow-structures.\r\n\r\nDecided contact metamorphism is traceable round the bosses, but is\r\nby no means uniform even in the same rock, some parts being highly\r\naltered, while others, exposed apparently to the same influences, have\r\nundergone little change. The most marked examples of this metamorphism\r\nare those in which the Cambrian limestone of Skye has been converted\r\ninto a pure white saccharoid marble. But the most interesting to the\r\nstudent of volcanic action are those where the altered rocks are older\r\nparts of the volcanic series. As the bosses of each volcanic area offer\r\ndistinctive peculiarities they will here be described geographically.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. THE ACID BOSSES OF SKYE\r\n\r\nIt is in the island of Skye that the granophyre and granite bosses\r\nattain their largest dimensions and afford, on the whole, the most\r\ncomplete evidence of their structures and their relations to the other\r\nparts of the volcanic series (Map VI.). They cover there a total area\r\nof about 25 square miles, and form characteristic groups of hills from\r\n2000 to 2500 feet in height. On the south-east side, three conspicuous\r\ncones (the Red Hills) rise from the valley of Strath (Beinn Dearg\r\nMhor, Beinn Dearg Bheag and Beinn na Caillich). A solitary graceful\r\npointed cone (Beinn na Cro) stands between Strathmore and Strathbeg,\r\nwhile to the north-west a continuous chain of connected cones runs from\r\nLoch Sligachan up into the heart of the Cuillin Hills. Their conical\r\noutlines, their smooth declivities, marked with long diverging lines\r\nof screes, and their pale reddish or reddish-yellow hue, that deepens\r\nafter a shower into glowing orange, mark off these hills from all the\r\nsurrounding eminences, and form in especial a singular contrast to the\r\nblack, spiry, and rugged contours of the gabbro heights to the west of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBesides this large continuous mass, a number of minor bosses are\r\nscattered over the district. Of these the largest forms the ridge of\r\nBeinn an Dubhaich, south of Loch Kilchrist. Several minor protrusions\r\nlie between that ridge and the flank of Beinn Dearg. Others protrude\r\nthrough the moory ground above Corry; several occur on the side of\r\nthe Sound of Scalpa, about Strollamus; and one, already referred to,\r\nlies at the eastern base of Blath Bheinn. In the neighbouring island\r\nof Raasay, a large area of granophyre likewise occurs, which will be\r\ndescribed with the Sills in later pages.\r\n\r\nIn so extensive a district there is room for considerable diversity\r\nof composition and texture among the rocks. As already stated, in\r\nsome places, more particularly in the central parts of the hills,\r\nthe acid material assumes the character of a granite, being made up\r\nof a holocrystalline aggregate of quartz, orthoclase, plagioclase,\r\nhornblende and biotite, without granophyric structure, and thus becomes\r\na hornblende-biotite-granite (quartz-syenite, granite-syenite of\r\nZirkel, or amphibole-granitite of Rosenbusch). By the development of\r\nthe micropegmatitic structure and radiated spherical concretions, it\r\npasses into granophyre. By the appearance of a felsitic groundmass, it\r\nshades off into different varieties of quartz-porphyry or rhyolite,\r\nsometimes with distinct bi-pyramidal crystals of quartz.[387] This\r\nchange, which here and there is observable along the edge of a boss,\r\nis sometimes accompanied with an ample development of spherulitic and\r\nflow-structures. As it is convenient to adopt some general term to\r\nexpress the whole series of varieties, I have used the word granophyre\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 387: The best account yet published of these varieties in Skye\r\nis that by Prof. Zirkel, _Zeitsch. Deutsch. Geol. Gesellsch._ xxiii.\r\n(1871) p. 88.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 346.--View of Glamich, 2537 feet, Glen Sligachan.\r\n(From a photograph by R. J. A. Berry, M.D., lent by the Scottish\r\nMountaineering Club).]\r\n\r\nThat the large area of these rocks in Skye was the result of many\r\nseparate protrusions from distinct centres of emission may be inferred,\r\nI think, not only from the varieties of petrographical character in\r\nthe material, but also from the peculiar topography of the ground,\r\nand perhaps from the curious relation which seems, in some instances\r\nat least, to be traceable between the external features and apparent\r\ninternal structure of the hills. It will be seen from the Map (No. VI.)\r\nthat in the area lying to the east of Strath More the granophyre is\r\nbroken up into nearly detached portions by intervening patches of older\r\nrocks. There can be little doubt that the mass of Beinn na Caillich\r\nand the two Beinn Deargs is the product of a distinct orifice, if not\r\nof more than one. Beinn na Cro, lying between its two deep bounding\r\nglens, is another protrusion. The western cones stand so closely\r\ntogether that their screes meet at the bottoms of the intervening\r\nvalleys. Yet each group is not improbably the result of emission from\r\nan independent funnel, like the separate domite puys of Auvergne.\r\n\r\nBut, though I believe this large area of granitoid rock to have\r\nproceeded not from one but from many orifices, I have only here and\r\nthere obtained, from the individual hills themselves, indications of an\r\ninternal structure suggestive of distinct and successive protrusions\r\nof material from the same vent of discharge. On the outer declivities\r\nof some of the cones we may detect a rudely bedded structure, which\r\nwill be subsequently referred to as well displayed in Rum (p. 403).\r\nThis structure is specially observable along the east side of Glen\r\nSligachan. Down the northern slopes of Marsco the granophyre (here in\r\npart a hornblende-biotite-granite) is disposed in massive sheets or\r\nbeds that plunge outwards from the centre of the hill at angles of 30°\r\nto 40°. On the southern front of the same graceful cone, as well as on\r\nthe flanks of its neighbour, Ruadh Stac, still plainer indications of\r\na definite arrangement of the mass of the rock in irregular lenticular\r\nbeds may be noticed. These beds, folding over the axis of the hill, dip\r\nsteeply down as concentric coats of rock. The external resemblance of\r\nthe red conical mountains of Skye to the trachyte puys of Auvergne was\r\nlong ago remarked by J. D. Forbes,[388] and in this internal arrangement\r\nof their materials, indefinite though it may be, there is a further\r\nresemblance to the onion-like coatings which Von Buch and Scrope\r\nremarked in the structure of the interior of the Grand Sarcoui.[389]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 388: _Edin. New Phil. Jour._ xl. p. 78.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 389: Von Buch, _Geognostische Beobachtungen auf Reisen durch\r\nDeutschland und Italien_, vol. ii. (1809) p. 245; Scrope, _Geology\r\nand Extinct Volcanoes of Central France_, 2nd edit. p. 68. Von Buch\r\nregarded the external form of this Puy as having been determined by its\r\ninternal structure.]\r\n\r\nWhere the contour of the cones is regular, and the declivities are not\r\nmarked by prominent scars and ribs of rock, this monotony of feature\r\nbetokens a corresponding uniformity of petrographical character. But\r\nwhere, on the other hand, the slopes are diversified by projecting\r\ncrags and other varieties of outline, a greater range of texture and\r\ncomposition in the material of the hills is indicated. This relation\r\nis well brought out on the western front of Marsco, where numerous\r\nalternations of granitoid and felsitic textures occur. On many\r\ndeclivities also, which at a distance look quite smooth, but which\r\nare really rough with angular blocks detached from the parent mass\r\nunderneath, an occasional basalt-dyke will be observed to rise as a\r\nprominent dark rib. A good example of this structure is to be seen on\r\nthe south front of Beinn na Caillich. Where a group of dark parallel\r\ndykes runs along the sides of one of these pale cones, it sometimes\r\nproduces a curiously deceptive appearance of bedding. A conspicuous\r\nillustration may be noticed on the southern front of Beinn Dearg\r\nMeadhonach, north from Marsco. When I first saw that hillside I could\r\nnot realize that the parallel bars were actually dykes until I had\r\ncrossed the valley and climbed the slopes of the hill.[390]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 390: The difference of contour and colour between the ordinary\r\nreddish smooth-sloped \"syenite\" and the black craggy \"hypersthene rock\"\r\nand \"greenstone\" in the Glamaig group of hills caught the eyes of Von\r\nOeynhausen and Von Dechen (Karsten's _Archiv_, i. p. 83).]\r\n\r\nGood evidence of successive protrusions of the acid rock within the\r\ngreat area of the Red Hills may be found on the south side of Meall\r\nDearg at the head of Glen Sligachan, where the granophyre is traversed\r\nby a younger band or dyke of fine-grained spherulitic material\r\nabout ten feet broad. The rock exhibits there the same beautiful\r\nflow-structure with rows of spherulites as is to be seen along the\r\ncontact of the main granophyre mass with the gabbro on the same hill,\r\nwhich will be afterwards described. This dyke, vein or band, though\r\npossibly belonging to the same epoch of protrusion as the surrounding\r\ngranophyre, must obviously be later than the consolidation of the rock\r\nwhich it traverses.\r\n\r\nOccasionally round the margin of the granophyre a singular brecciated\r\nstructure is to be seen. I have found it well marked on weathered\r\nfaces, along the flanks of Glamaig and of Marsco, and Mr. Harker has\r\nobserved many examples of it on the north side of the granophyre\r\nmass of the Red Hills. When the rock is broken open, it is less easy\r\nto detect the angular and subangular fragments from the surrounding\r\nmatrix, which is finely crystalline or felsitic.\r\n\r\nThe actual junction of the eruptive mass with the surrounding rocks\r\nthrough which it has ascended is generally a nearly vertical boundary,\r\nbut the granophyre sometimes plunges at a greater or less angle under\r\nthe rocks that lie against or upon it. On the north side of Glamaig,\r\nfor instance, the prophyritic and felsitic margin of the great body\r\nof eruptive rock descends as a steeply inclined wall, against which\r\nthe red sandstones and marls at the base of the Secondary formations\r\nare sharply tilted. On the south side of the area a similar steep\r\nface of fine-grained rock forms the edge of the granophyre of the\r\ngreat southern cones, and plunges down behind Lias limestone and\r\nshale, Cambrian limestone and quartzite, or portions of the Tertiary\r\nvolcanic series. Where the granophyre cuts vertically through the\r\ngabbro, the latter rock being more durable is apt to rise above the\r\nmore decomposable granophyre as a crag or wall, and thus the deceptive\r\nappearance arises of the basic overlying the acid rock. As above\r\nmentioned, there seems every reason to believe that this peculiarity of\r\nweathering has given rise to or confirmed the mistaken impression that\r\nthe granophyre is older than the gabbro.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, however, that along many parts of the\r\nboundary-line the acid eruptive mass extends underneath the surface\r\nfar beyond the actual base of the cones, for projecting knobs as\r\nwell as veins and dykes of it rise up among the surrounding rocks.\r\nThis is well seen along the northern foot of Beinn na Caillich. But\r\nof all the Skye bosses none exhibits its line of junction with the\r\nsurrounding rocks so well and continuously as Beinn an Dubhaich. This\r\nisolated tract of eruptive material lies entirely within the area\r\nof the Cambrian limestone, and its actual contact with that rock,\r\nand with the basalt-dykes that traverse it, can be examined almost\r\neverywhere. The junction is usually vertical or nearly so, sometimes\r\ninclining outwards, sometimes inwards. It is notched and wavy, the\r\ngranite sending out projecting spurs or veins, and retiring into little\r\nbays, which are occupied by the limestone. The subdivisions of the\r\nlatter rock have recently been traced by Mr. Harker up to one side of\r\nthe granite and recognized again on the other side, with no apparent\r\ndisplacement, as if so much limestone had been punched out to make way\r\nfor the uprise of the acid boss. The older dykes, too, are continuous\r\non either side of the ridge. The granite is massive and jointed,\r\nsplitting up into great quadrangular blocks like an ancient granite,\r\nand weathering into rounded boulders. Its granitic composition and\r\ntexture are best seen where the mass is broadest, south of Kilbride.\r\nTowards its margin, on the shore of Camas Malag, the granophyric\r\nstructure appears, especially in narrow ribbons or veins that run\r\nthrough the more granitic parts of the rock. These may be compared with\r\nthe much larger dyke of spherulitic rock above noticed as traversing\r\nthe granophyre of Meall Dearg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 347.--Section across the north slope of Beinn an\r\nDubhaich, Skye.\r\n\r\n_a_ _a_, Cambrian limestone; _b_ _b_, basalt dykes; _c_, granite.]\r\n\r\nImmediately to the south of Camas Malag the junction with the limestone\r\nis well displayed, and the eruptive rock, which is there granitic\r\nin character, sends out into the limestone a vein or dyke about two\r\nfeet broad, of closer grain than the main body of the boss, but still\r\ndistinctly granitic in structure. The junction on the north side\r\nis equally well seen below the crofts of Torran. Here the rock of\r\nthe boss, for a few yards from its margin, assumes a fine-grained\r\nfelsitic aspect, and under the microscope presents a curious brecciated\r\nappearance, suggestive of its having broken up at the margin before\r\nfinal consolidation. Portions of the already crystallized granite seem\r\nto be involved in a microgranitic base. The rock has here truncated a\r\nnumber of basalt-dykes which intersect the Cambrian limestone. To one\r\nof these further reference will be made in the sequel.\r\n\r\nOn the surface of the mass of Beinn an Dubhaich, a few little patches\r\nof limestone occur to the south of Kilchrist Loch. Considering the\r\nnearly vertical wall which the granophyre presents to the adjacent\r\nrock all round its margin, we may perhaps reasonably infer that these\r\noutliers of limestone are remnants of a once continuous limestone sheet\r\nthat overlay the eruptive rock, and hence that, with due allowance for\r\nconsiderable denudation, the present surface of the boss represents\r\napproximately the upper limit to which the granophyre ascended through\r\nthe limestone. The actual facts are shown in Fig. 347.\r\n\r\nAll round the margin of this boss, the limestone has been converted\r\nfor a variable distance of a few feet or many yards into a granular\r\ncrystalline marble. The lighter portions of the limestone have become\r\nsnowy white; but some of the darker carbonaceous beds retain their\r\ndark tint. The nodules of chert, abundant in many of the limestones,\r\nproject from the weathered faces of the marble. The dolomitic portions\r\nof the series have likewise undergone alteration into a thoroughly\r\ncrystalline-granular or saccharoid rock. The most thorough metamorphism\r\nis exhibited by portions of the limestone which are completely\r\nsurrounded by and rest upon the granite. The largest of these overlying\r\npatches was many years ago quarried for white marble above the old\r\nManse of Kilchrist. I have shown by lithological, stratigraphical and\r\npalæontological evidence that this limestone, instead of belonging\r\nto the Lias, as was formerly believed, forms a part of the Cambrian\r\nor possibly the very lowest Silurian series, being a continuation of\r\nthe fossiliferous limestone of western Sutherland and Ross-shire.[391]\r\nMr. Clough and Mr. Harker, in the progress of the Geological Survey\r\nin Skye, have ascertained that the distinctive characters of the\r\nthree groups of strata into which the limestone can be divided may be\r\nrecognized even through the midst of the metamorphism.[392]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 391: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xliv. (1888) p. 62.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 392: _Annual Report of Director-General of the Geological\r\nSurvey for 1895._]\r\n\r\nThe generally vertical line of separation between the rock of Beinn\r\nan Dubhaich and the contiguous limestone has been taken advantage of\r\nfor the segregation of mineral veins. On the southern boundary at\r\nCamas Malag, a greenish flinty layer, from less than an inch to two\r\nor three inches in width, consisting of a finely-granular aggregate\r\nof some nearly colourless mineral, which polarizes brilliantly, coats\r\nthe wall of the granophyre, and also both sides of the vein which\r\nproceeds from that rock into the limestone. But the most abundant\r\nand interesting deposits are metalliferous. Fragments of a kind of\r\n\"gossan\" may be noticed all along the boundary-line of the boss, and\r\namong these are pieces of magnetic iron-ore and sulphides of iron and\r\ncopper. The magnetite may be seen in place immediately to the south of\r\nKilbride. A mass of this ore several feet in diameter sends strings\r\nand disseminated particles through the surrounding granophyre, and is\r\npartially coated along its joints with green carbonate of copper.\r\n\r\nFrom the Skye area important evidence is obtainable in regard to the\r\nrelation of the acid eruptions to (1) earlier eruptive vents filled\r\nwith agglomerate; (2) the bedded basalts of the plateaux; (3) the\r\nbosses, sills and dykes of gabbro and dolerite; and (4) the great\r\nsystem of basic dykes.\r\n\r\n(1) _Relation of the Granophyre to older Eruptive Vents._--The\r\ngranophyre of Beinn na Caillich and the two Beinn Deargs has invaded\r\non its north-eastern side the Cambrian limestone and quartzite, and has\r\ntruncated the sheets of intrusive dolerite and gabbro that have there\r\nbeen injected into them. But to the south-west it rises through the\r\ngreat Strath agglomerate already described, and continues in that rock\r\nround to the entrance into Strath Beg. The eruptive mass is in great\r\npart surrounded with a ring of agglomerate, as if it had risen up a\r\nhuge volcanic chimney and solidified there, though probably there were\r\nmore than one vent in this agglomerate area. Again the thick mass of\r\nagglomerate north of Belig is interposed between the bedded lavas and\r\nthe great granophyre mass which extends northwards to Loch Sligachan.\r\nOn the west side of the Blaven ridge, a number of masses of agglomerate\r\nare found on both sides of Glen Sligachan, along the border of the same\r\ngreat tract of acid rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 348.--Section from Beinn Dearg to Beinn an\r\nDubhaich, Skye.\r\n\r\n  _a_ _a_, Cambrian limestone; _b_ _b_, volcanic agglomerate; _c_ _c_\r\n  _c_, basalt-dykes older than granophyre; _d^1_, granophyre of Beinn\r\n  Dearg; _d^2_, granophyre in the agglomerate neck; _d^3_, granite of\r\n  Beinn an Dubhaich; _e_, basalt-dyke younger than granite.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to the relation of the granophyre of the Red Hills to the\r\ngreat agglomerate of Strath, we may infer that the granophyre has\r\nnot risen exactly in the centre of the old funnel, but rather to the\r\nnorth of it, unless we suppose, as already suggested, that some of\r\nthe agglomerate belongs to the cone that gathered round the eruptive\r\norifice. It is interesting to observe, however, that granophyre, from\r\nthe same or from another centre of protrusion, has likewise risen along\r\nthe outer or southern margin of the agglomerate, generally between that\r\nrock and the limestone, but sometimes entirely within the agglomerate.\r\nThe distance between the nearest part of this ring of eruptive rock\r\nand the edge of the boss of Beinn an Dubhaich is under 400 yards,\r\nthe intervening space being occupied by limestone (or marble), much\r\ntraversed by north-west basalt-dykes. Most of these dykes do not enter\r\nthe rocks of the vent, and are abruptly truncated by the mass of Beinn\r\nan Dubhaich. The probable structure of this locality is shown in Fig\r\n348.\r\n\r\nThe masses of agglomerate which further westward so curiously follow\r\nthe margin of the great granophyre bosses, and those which are\r\nentangled in that rock and in the gabbro, probably indicate, as already\r\nsuggested, the position of a group of older volcanic funnels which\r\nprovided facilities for the uprise of the basic and acid magmas.\r\nThe group of vents which, as we have seen, probably rose out of the\r\nplateau-basalts, and first served for the rise of the masses of gabbro,\r\nhas by the subsequent protrusion of the granophyres been still further\r\ndestroyed and concealed.\r\n\r\nThe granophyre intrusions in the great Strath agglomerate have lately\r\nbeen mapped and described by Mr. Harker. As regards their internal\r\nstructure and composition, this observer remarks that compared with the\r\nnormal granophyres of the Red Hills and other bosses of the district,\r\nthese smaller intrusive masses are darker and manifestly richer in the\r\niron-bearing minerals, and have a slightly higher specific gravity. But\r\nin their general characters they agree with the other granophyres. The\r\nmost interesting feature in them is the evidence they afford that they\r\nhave enclosed and partially dissolved fragments of basic rocks. To this\r\nevidence further reference will be made on a later page (see p. 392).\r\n\r\n(2) _Relation of the Granophyre to the Bedded Basalts of the Plateaux.\r\nMetamorphism of the Basalts._--On the north-west side, the granophyre\r\nof Glamaig and Glen Sligachan mounts directly out of the bedded\r\nbasalts. These latter rocks, which rise into characteristic terraced\r\nslopes on the north side of Loch Sligachan, appear on the south side\r\nimmediately to the west of Sconser, and stretch westwards round the\r\nroots of Glamaig into the Coire na Sgairde. As they approach that hill\r\nthey assume the usual dull, indurated, splintery, veined character of\r\ntheir contact metamorphism, and weather with a pale crust. Some of them\r\nare highly amygdaloidal, and between their successive beds thin bands\r\nof basalt-breccia, also much hardened, occasionally appear. Veins of\r\ngranophyre become more numerous nearer the main mass of that rock.\r\nThe actual line of junction runs into the Coire na Sgairde and slants\r\nup the Druim na Ruaige, ascending to within a few feet of the top of\r\nthat ridge. A dark basic rock lies on the granophyre, the latter being\r\nhere finer grained and greenish in colour, and projecting up into the\r\nformer.[393] There is so much detritus along the sides and floor of\r\nGlen Sligachan that the relations of the two groups of rock cannot be\r\nwell examined there. But the basalts, which present their ordinary\r\ncharacters to the north of the Inn, are observed to become more and\r\nmore indurated, close-grained, dull and splintery, as they draw nearer\r\nto the granophyre of Marsco. This part of the district furnishes the\r\nclearest evidence of the posteriority of the great cones of Glamaig and\r\nits neighbours to the plateau-basalts which come up to the very base of\r\nthese hills.[394]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 393: I think it probable that some of the greenish portions of\r\nthe granophyre along this part of the junction-line will be found to\r\nhave had their structure and composition altered by having incorporated\r\ninto their substance a proportion of the bedded basalts through which\r\nthey have been disrupted.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 394: The dykes of granophyre in these basalts are referred to\r\nat p. 444.]\r\n\r\nRound the eastern group of cones some interesting fragments of the\r\nonce continuous sheet of plateau-basalts remain, and show the same\r\nrelation of the acid protrusions on that side. One of these lies on\r\nthe granophyre of the flanks of Beinn na Caillich, a little to the\r\nwest of the loch at the northern base of that hill. Another of larger\r\nsize forms a prominent knob about three-quarters of a mile further\r\nwest, and is prolonged into the huge dark excrescence of Creagan Dubha,\r\nwhich rises in such striking contrast to the smooth red declivities\r\nof the granophyre cones around it. This prominence at its eastern\r\nand northern parts consists of highly indurated splintery basalt in\r\ndistinct beds, some of which are strongly amygdaloidal. The bedding is\r\nnearly vertical, but with an inclination inwards to the hill. Towards\r\nthe south-west end a thin band of basalt-breccia makes its appearance\r\nbetween two beds of basalt. Its thickness rapidly increases southward\r\nuntil it is the only rock adhering to the granophyre. Beyond the foot\r\nof the hill, limestone and quartzite occupy for some distance the\r\nbottom of Strath Beg, much invaded by masses of quartz-porphyry. At the\r\nsummit of Creagan Dubha abundant veins run into the basic rocks from\r\nthe granophyre, which is here finer grained towards the margin; and\r\nthere are likewise veins of quartz-porphyry which, though their actual\r\nconnection with the main mass of granophyre cannot be seen, are no\r\ndoubt apophyses from it.\r\n\r\nThis outlier of altered basalt and breccia appears to me to be a\r\nfragment of the plateau-basalts which once overlay the Cambrian and\r\nJurassic rocks of Strath Beg, and were disrupted by the uprise of the\r\ngranophyre. It continues to adhere to the wall of the eruptive mass\r\nthat broke up and baked its rocks. Its breccia, passing southward into\r\na coarse agglomerate, may be a product of the same vent or group of\r\nvents that discharged the great agglomerate mass above Kilbride and\r\nKilchrist. I have already (p. 282) referred to what appears to be\r\nanother outlier of the basalts on the south side of Beinn Dearg.\r\n\r\nOn the northern and southern flanks of Beinn na Cro, similar evidence\r\nmay be observed of the posteriority of the granophyre to the basic\r\nrocks. Round the northern base of the hill a continuous tract of\r\nplateau-basalts, dolerites and gabbros forms the ridge between\r\nStrathmore and Strathbeg. There is an admirable section of the relation\r\nof the two groups of rock on the eastern side of the western glen.\r\nAlong the lower part of the declivity, coarsely-crystalline gabbros,\r\nlike some of those in the Cuillin Hills, are succeeded by sheets of\r\ndolerite and basalt, the whole forming an ascending succession of beds\r\nto the summit of the ridge. The edges of these beds are obliquely\r\ntruncated by the body of granophyre, which slants up the hill across\r\nthem and sends veins into them. They are further traversed by basalt\r\ndykes, which here, as almost everywhere, abound (Fig. 349). On the\r\nsouth side of Beinn na Cro, highly indurated black and grey Lias\r\nshales and sandstones have been tilted up steeply and indurated by the\r\neruptive rock of the hill; and at one place some 800 feet above the\r\nsea, a little patch of altered basalt, lying on the shale, but close\r\nup against the steep declivity of granophyre, forms a conspicuous\r\nprominence on the otherwise featureless slope.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the mass of fine-grained\r\nhornblende-granite which runs for several miles at the base of the\r\nvolcanic series on the eastern side of the Blaven group of hills. Mr.\r\nHarker has traced a great development of granophyre on the west side of\r\nthese hills, where the acid rock sends apophyses both into the bedded\r\nbasalts and into the gabbros.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 349.--Section at north end of Beinn na Cro, Skye.\r\n\r\n_a_, basalt, dolerite and gabbro; _b_, granophyre of Beinn na Cro;\r\n_b′_, dyke of granophyre; _c_ _c_, basalt dykes.]\r\n\r\nCombining the results of observations made not only in Skye but in\r\nMull, Rum and Ardnamurchan, I shall here give a fuller account of the\r\nmetamorphism of the basalts, to which frequent allusion has been made\r\nas one of the evidences of the posteriority of the eruptive bosses of\r\nrock round which it occurs.[395] The field-geologist observes that the\r\nbasalts, as they are traced towards these bosses, lose their usual\r\nexternal characters. They no longer weather into spheroidal blocks with\r\na rich brown loam, but project in much jointed crags, and their hard\r\nrugged surface shows when broken a thin white crust, beneath which the\r\nrock appears black or dark bluish-grey, dull and splintery. They are\r\ngenerally veined with minute threads or strings of calcite, epidote and\r\nquartz, which form a yellowish-brown network that projects above the\r\nrest of the weathered surface. Where they are amygdaloidal, the kernels\r\nno longer decay away or drop out, leaving the empty smooth-surfaced\r\ncells, but remain as if they graduated into the surrounding rock by\r\nan interlacing of their crystalline constituents. They then look at a\r\ndistance more like spots of decoloration, and even when seen close at\r\nhand would hardly at first betray their real nature.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 395: Many years ago I was much struck with the evidence of\r\nalteration in the igneous rocks of Mull, and referred to it in several\r\npapers, _Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin._ (1866-67) vol. vi. p. 73; _Quart.\r\nJourn. Geol. Soc._ xxvii. (1871) p. 282, note. The subject was more\r\nfully discussed in my memoir in the _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxxv.\r\n(1888) p. 167, from which the account in the text is taken. Prof.\r\nJudd has more recently referred the alteration to solfataric action\r\n(_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xlvi. 1890, p. 341). As already mentioned,\r\nI have been unable to detect evidence of such action. The alteration\r\nis always intimately connected with the presence of intrusive masses,\r\nand it affects indifferently any part of the basalt-plateaux which may\r\nchance to lie next to these masses. The bedded lavas can be traced step\r\nby step from their usual unaltered condition in the plateaux to their\r\nmetamorphosed state next to the eruptive rocks. The nature or degree\r\nof the metamorphism has doubtless somewhat varied with the composition\r\nand structure of the rocks affected, and with the character and mass\r\nof the eruptive material; but it is certainly not confined to the\r\nolder parts of the plateaux, nor to any supposed pre-basaltic group of\r\nandesites. I have found no evidence that such a group anywhere preceded\r\nthe plateau-basalts. The andesites, so far at least as my observations\r\ngo, were erupted at intervals during the plateau period, and alternate\r\nwith the true basalts. The greatest accumulation of them lies not below\r\nbut above the general body of the basalts, in the \"pale group\" of Mull.\r\nNor even if the term \"propylite\" be adopted for these altered rocks,\r\ncan it be applied to any special horizon in the volcanic series. The\r\nalteration of the basic rocks by the granophyre of St. Kilda will be\r\ndescribed in the account of that island in Chapter xlvii.]\r\n\r\nFrom the specimens collected by me among the Inner Hebrides up to the\r\nyear 1888, I selected two dozen which seemed to be fairly typical of\r\nthese altered rocks, and placed thin slices of them for microscopic\r\nexamination in Dr. Hatch's hands. His notes may be condensed into the\r\nfollowing summary. One of the most frequent features in the slides is\r\nthe tendency in the component minerals to assume granular forms. In\r\none specimen from Loch Spelve, Mull, the rock, probably originally\r\na dolerite, shows only a few isolated recognizable crystals of\r\nplagioclase and augite, the whole of the rest of the rock consisting of\r\nroundish granules embedded in a felspathic matrix. The felspar crystals\r\nare sometimes broken up into a mosaic, though retaining their external\r\ncontours. Besides the granules, which are no doubt augite, a few grains\r\nof magnetite are scattered through the rock, aggregated here and there\r\ninto little groups. In another specimen, taken from the junction with\r\nthe granophyre in Glenmore in the same island, parts of the augite\r\ncrystals are converted into granular aggregates associated with large\r\ngrains and patches of magnetite. The latter mineral also assumes in\r\nsome of the rocks granular and even globular shapes suggestive of\r\nfusion.\r\n\r\nThe felspars, which in most of the basic rocks are usually remarkably\r\nclear and fresh, show marked kaolinization in some of these altered\r\nmasses. Minute dusky scales of kaolin are developed, sometimes also\r\nwith the separation of minute grains of quartz. The augite shows\r\nfrequent alteration to hornblende, proceeding as usual from the\r\nexterior inward. In some cases only an envelope of uralite appears\r\nround the augite, while in others only a kernel of the original mineral\r\nis left, or the whole crystal has been changed. In many cases the\r\naltered substance appears as minute needles, blades and fibres of\r\nactinolite. Occasionally, besides the green hornblende, shred-like\r\npieces of a strongly pleochroic brown hornblende make their appearance.\r\nSerpentinous and chloritic substances are not infrequent. Epidote is\r\nsometimes abundant. The titaniferous iron has commonly passed more\r\nor less completely into leucoxene. Here and there a dark mica may be\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\nSince the year 1888 I have continued the investigation of this subject,\r\nand have especially studied the metamorphism of the bedded basalts\r\non the western shores of Loch Scavaig, where, as already described,\r\nthey are truncated by vertical beds of gabbro, and are traversed by\r\nbasalt-dykes and by abundant veins of fine-grained granophyre. The\r\nalteration here effected affords excellent materials for study, as the\r\nvery same sheets of basalt can be followed from the normal conditions\r\noutside to the altered state within the influence of the metamorphic\r\nagent. The alternations of amygdaloidal and more compact sheets\r\ncan still be recognized, although their enclosed amygdales have in\r\nplaces been almost effaced. They show the dull, indurated, splintery\r\ncharacter, with the white weathered crust, so distinctive of this type\r\nof contact-metamorphism. They are traversed by numerous sills and veins\r\nof gabbro. As has been already suggested, although no large mass of\r\ngranophyre appears here at the surface, the alteration of the basalts\r\nis probably to be attributed not so much to the influence of the\r\ngabbro, as to the abundant acid sills, dykes and veins, for there may\r\nbe a considerable body of granophyre underneath the locality, the dykes\r\nand veins being indications of its vicinity.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1895 I examined the locality with much care, and\r\ncollected some typical specimens illustrative of the conditions of\r\nmetamorphism presented by different varieties of the bedded basalts.\r\nThin slices cut from these specimens were placed in Mr. Harker's hands\r\nfor microscopical examination, and he furnished me with the following\r\nnotes regarding them.\r\n\r\n\"In hand-specimens the bedded basalts from the neighbourhood of the\r\ngabbro of Loch Scavaig [6613-6618] do not appear very different from\r\nthe normal basalts of this region. The most conspicuous secondary\r\nmineral is yellowish-green epidote in patches, and especially in the\r\namygdales.\r\n\r\n\"The texture of the rocks varies, and the slices show that the\r\nmicro-structure also varies, the augite occurring sometimes in small\r\nophitic plates, sometimes in small rounded granules. The chief\r\nsecondary change in the body of the rock is shown by the augite, which\r\nis seen in various stages of conversion to greenish fibrous hornblende.\r\nSome round patches seem also to consist mainly of the latter mineral,\r\nand are probably pseudomorphs after olivine. Here the little fibres are\r\nconfusedly matted together, without the parallelism proper to uralite\r\nderived from augite. No fresh olivine has been observed. The felspar\r\nand magnetite of the basalts show little or no sign of metamorphic\r\nprocesses, unless a rather unusual degree of clearness in the felspar\r\ncrystals is to be regarded in that light.\r\n\r\n\"The contents of the metamorphosed amygdales are not always the same.\r\nEpidote is usually present in some abundance, and in well-shaped\r\ncrystals. It has a pale citron tint in the slices, with marked\r\npleochroism; but a given crystal is not always uniform in its optical\r\ncharacters. Frequently the interior is pale, and has a quite low\r\nbirefringence. This is probably to be regarded as an intergrowth of\r\nzoisite in the epidote, and there are a few distinct crystals of\r\nzoisite seen in some places.\r\n\r\n\"In the slide which best exhibits these features [6613] the crystals\r\nof epidote are in part enwrapped and enclosed by what are doubtless\r\nzeolitic minerals. At least two of these are to be distinguished. One,\r\nvery nearly isotropic, and with a pale-brownish tint, is probably\r\nanalcime. Associated with this is a colourless mineral with partial\r\nradiate arrangement and with twin lamellation; the birefringence is\r\nsomewhat higher than that of quartz, and the γ-axis of optic elasticity\r\nmakes a small angle with the twin-line. These characters agree with\r\nthose of epistilbite. In other parts of the same large amygdale, the\r\nepidote crystals are embedded in what seems to be a felspar. This\r\nlatter mineral is rather obscure, and twin-lamellation is rarely to\r\nbe detected; but it seems highly probable that felspar has here been\r\ndeveloped by metamorphic agency at the expense of zeolites which once\r\noccupied the amygdale. I have observed undoubted examples of this in\r\nmetamorphosed basalts from other parts of Skye, _e.g._ from Creagan\r\nDubha, near the granophyre mass of Beinn Dearg.[396] The felspar occurs\r\nthere in the same fashion, and in the same relation to epidote [2700,\r\n2701]. In the specimens now described the chief minerals in the\r\nmetamorphosed amygdales are those already named: others occur more\r\nsparingly, associated with them. In some cases there is a grass-green,\r\nstrongly pleochroic, actinolitic hornblende, accompanied by a little\r\niron pyrites [6615].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 396: Compare _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xxxv. p. 166.]\r\n\r\n\"Epidote and various hornblendic and augitic minerals are\r\ncharacteristic products in the metamorphism of amygdaloidal basalts\r\nin other regions: felspar with this mode of occurrence I have not\r\nseen except in Skye, where it seems to connect itself naturally with\r\nthe abundance of zeolites in the amygdales of the non-metamorphosed\r\nlavas. It is to be observed that in these basalts from Loch Scavaig the\r\nalteration is shown especially in the amygdales, the body of the rock\r\nnot being greatly affected: this indicates a not very advanced stage\r\nof metamorphism. The production of uralitic hornblende, rather than\r\nbrown mica, from the augite and its decomposition-products, seems to be\r\ncharacteristic of the metamorphism of basaltic as distinguished from\r\nandesitic rocks, and is well illustrated by a comparison of the two\r\nsets of lavas near the Shap granite.\"[397]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 397: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlix. (1893) p. 361.]\r\n\r\nMr. Harker, who is at present engaged in mapping the central region of\r\nSkye, has had occasion to go over a number of the localities (Creagan\r\nDubha, etc.) originally cited by me, and, while corroborating my\r\ngeneral conclusions regarding them, has been able to obtain much fresh\r\nevidence regarding the nature and extent of the metamorphism which the\r\nbedded basalts have undergone. The results of his investigations will\r\nbe published when the Geological Survey of Skye is further advanced.\r\n\r\n(3) _Relation of the Granophyre to the Gabbros._--That the granophyres\r\ninvade the gabbros has been incidentally illustrated in the foregoing\r\npages. But as the mutual relations of the two rocks in the island of\r\nSkye have been the subject of frequent reference in previous writings\r\nof geologists, it is desirable to adduce some detailed evidence from a\r\nregion which has been regarded as the typical one for this feature in\r\nthe geological structure of the Inner Hebrides. No geological boundary\r\nis more easily traced than that between the pale reddish granophyre and\r\nthe dark gabbro. It can be followed with the eye up a whole mountain\r\nside, and can be examined so closely that again and again the observer\r\ncan walk or climb for some distance with one foot on each rock. That\r\nthere should ever have been any doubt about the relations of the two\r\neruptive masses is possibly explicable by the very facility with which\r\ntheir junction can be observed. Their contrasts of form and colour make\r\ntheir boundary over crag and ridge so clear that geologists do not\r\nseem to have taken the trouble to follow it out in detail. And as the\r\npale rock undoubtedly often underlies the dark, they have assumed this\r\ninfraposition to mark its earlier appearance.\r\n\r\nI will only cite one part of the junction line, which is easily\r\naccessible, for it lies in Glen Sligachan immediately to the south of\r\nthe mouth of Harta Corry. The rounded eminence of Meall Dearg, which\r\nrises to the south of the two Black Lochs, belongs to the granophyre,\r\nwhile the rugged ground to the west of it lies in the gabbro. The\r\nactual contact between the two rocks can be followed from the side of\r\nHarta Corry over the ridge and down into Strath na Creitheach, whence\r\nit sweeps northward between the red cone of Ruadh Stac and the black\r\nrugged declivities of Garbh Beinn. There is no more singular scene\r\nin Skye than the lonely tract on the south side of Meall Dearg. The\r\nground for some way is nearly level, and strewn with red shingle from\r\nthe decomposing granophyre underneath. It reminds one of some parts of\r\nthe desert \"Bad lands\" of Western America. Grim dark crags of gabbro,\r\nwith veins from the granophyre, rise along its western border, beyond\r\nwhich tower the black precipices of the Cuillins, while the flaming\r\nreddish-yellow cones of Glen Sligachan stand out against the northern\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nHaving recently described in some detail the relations of the boss\r\nof granophyre at this interesting locality, I will only here offer a\r\nbrief summary of the chief features.[398] The granophyre of Meall Dearg\r\nforms a marginal portion of the great mass of the Red Hills. It has\r\nbroken across the banded gabbros, and also cuts an isolated boss of\r\nagglomerate in the ridge of Druim an Eidhne. Its line of junction is\r\nnearly vertical, but along part of its course the wall of gabbro rises\r\nhigher than that of the more decomposable granophyre. Hence the origin\r\nof the black crags that crown the red slopes of granophyre debris. Seen\r\nfrom a distance the basic rock seems to rest as a great bed upon the\r\nacid mass.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 398: See _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. 1. (1894) p. 212.]\r\n\r\nThe younger date and intrusive nature of the granophyre are well shown\r\nby the change in the texture of the mass as it approaches the rocks\r\nagainst which it has cooled. The ordinary granophyric characters\r\nrapidly pass into a fine-grained felsitic texture, and this change\r\nis accompanied with the development of a remarkably well-defined\r\nflow-structure and of rows of spherulites which run parallel to the\r\nboundary wall. In a ravine on the west side of Meall Dearg, the lines\r\nof flow-structure and rows of large spherulites are seen to be arranged\r\nvertically against the face of gabbro.\r\n\r\nFurther proof of the later date of the protrusion of the granophyre\r\nis supplied by abundant felsitic dykes and veins which traverse the\r\ngabbro, and some of which can be seen to proceed from the main body of\r\ngranophyre. These intrusions will be described in the next chapter, in\r\nconnection with the dykes and veins of the acid rocks.\r\n\r\nAdditional evidence as to the posteriority of the granophyre to the\r\ngabbro has recently been obtained by Mr. Harker from a study of the\r\ninternal structure and composition of the masses of these rocks which\r\nhave been intruded into the agglomerate above Loch Kilchrist in\r\nStrath. He has found that the granophyre has there caught up from some\r\nsubterranean depth portions of gabbro, and has partially dissolved\r\nthem, thereby undergoing a modification of its own composition. \"The\r\ngabbro-debris,\" he remarks, \"has been for the most part completely\r\ndisintegrated by the caustic or solvent action of the acid magma on\r\nsome of its minerals. Those constituents which resisted such action\r\nhave been set free and now figure as xenocrysts [foreign crystals],\r\neither intact or more or less perfectly transformed into other\r\nsubstances. At the same time the material absorbed has modified the\r\ncomposition of the magma, in the general sense of rendering it less\r\nacid.\" Mr. Harker has traced the fate of each of the minerals of the\r\ngabbro in the process of solution and isolation in the acid magma,\r\nwhich, where this process has been most developed, is believed by him\r\nto have taken up foreign material amounting to fully one-fourth of its\r\nown bulk, derived not from the rocks immediately around, but from a\r\ngabbro probably at a considerable depth beneath.[399]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 399: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. lii. (1896) p. 320.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 350.--Ground-plan of basic dyke in Cambrian Limestones\r\n  truncated by granophyre which encloses large blocks of the dyke,\r\n  Torrin, Skye.\r\n]\r\n\r\n(4) _Relation of the Granophyre to the Basic Dykes and\r\nVeins._--Reference has already been made to the fact that the \"syenite\"\r\nbosses of Skye cut off most of the basalt-dykes, but are themselves\r\ntraversed by a few others.[400] The locality that furnished me with\r\nthe evidence on which this statement was originally made nearly\r\nforty years ago affords in small compass a clearer presentation of\r\nthe facts than I have elsewhere met with. The sections described by\r\nme are visible at the eastern end of the boss of Beinn an Dubhaich,\r\nStrath; but similar and even better examples may be cited from the\r\nwhole northern and southern margins of that eruptive mass. On the\r\nnorth side an extraordinary number of dykes may be traced in the\r\nCambrian limestone from the shores of Loch Slapin eastwards. They\r\nhave a general north-westerly trend, but one after another, as I have\r\nalready remarked, is abruptly cut off by the granophyre. As an example\r\nof the way in which this truncation takes place, I may site a single\r\nillustration from the northern margin of the eruptive mass, near\r\nTorrin. It might perhaps be contended that the numerous dykes which\r\ntraverse the limestone and stop short at the edge of the acid rock,\r\nare not necessarily older than the granophyre, but may actually be\r\nyounger, their sudden termination at the edge of the acid boss being\r\ndue to their inability to traverse that rock. That this explanation\r\nis untenable is readily proved by such sections as that given in Fig.\r\n350, where a basic dyke (_b_) 9 or 10 feet broad running through the\r\nCambrian Limestone (_a_ _a_) is abruptly cut off by the edge of the\r\ngreat granophyre boss. Not only is the dyke sharply truncated, but\r\nnumerous pieces of it, from an inch to more than a foot in length,\r\nare enclosed in the granophyre. The latter is well exposed along the\r\nshore of Loch Slapin in an almost continuous section of nearly a mile\r\nin length. The contrast therefore between the development of dykes\r\nwithin and beyond its area cannot but arrest the attention of the\r\nobserver. Though I was on the outlook for dykes in the granophyre, I\r\nfound only one. Yet immediately beyond the eruptive boss they at once\r\nappear on either side up to its very edge, where they suddenly cease.\r\nThe conclusion cannot be resisted that the protrusion of the acid rock\r\ntook place after most of the dykes of the district had been formed, but\r\nbefore the emission of the very latest dykes, which pursue a north-west\r\ncourse across the boss (Fig. 348).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 400: _Ante_, p. 173, and _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xiv.\r\n(1857) p. 16.]\r\n\r\nSome sections on the southern margin of Beinn an Dubhaich complete\r\nthe demonstration that such has been the order of appearance of the\r\nrocks. Near the head of the Allt Lèth Slighe (or Half-way Burn), where\r\nthe granite has pushed a long tongue into the limestone, a north-west\r\nbasalt-dyke is abruptly cut off by the main body of the boss and by the\r\nprotruded vein (Fig. 351). Besides this truncation, the acid rock sends\r\nout strings and threads of its own substance into and across the dyke,\r\nthese injected portions being as usual of an exceedingly fine felsitic\r\ntexture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 351.--Section on south side of Beinn an Dubhaich,\r\nSkye, showing the truncation of a basalt-dyke (_b_), in Cambrian\r\nLimestone (_a_), by the granite (_c_) of Beinn an Dubhaich, Skye.]\r\n\r\nSimilar evidence may be gathered from the area of the great granophyre\r\ncones further north. The profusion of basalt-dykes in the surrounding\r\nrocks stops short at the margin of that area. The comparatively few\r\ndykes which cross the boundary pursue a general north-west course\r\nthrough the granophyre, and, as already remarked, from their dark\r\ncolour, greater durability and straightness of direction, stand out as\r\nprominent ribs on the flanks of the pale cones which they traverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\n      THE ACID BOSSES OF MULL, SMALL ISLES, ST. KILDA, ARRAN AND\r\n                       THE NORTH-EAST OF IRELAND\r\n\r\n\r\nii. THE ACID BOSSES OF MULL\r\n\r\nThough of comparatively small extent, the granophyre bosses of the\r\nisland of Mull afford to the geologist a large amount of instruction in\r\nregard to the relations of the different members of the volcanic series\r\nto each other. Especially important is the evidence which they contain\r\nof the connection between the acid and basic groups of rocks. They have\r\nbeen laid bare in many natural sections, some of which, forming entire\r\nhillsides, are among the most astonishing in the whole wonderful series\r\nwhich, dissected by denudation, reveal to us the structure of these\r\nvolcanic regions. They lie in two chief areas. One of these extends\r\nalong the northern flanks of the mountainous tract from the western\r\nside of Beinn Fhada across Loch Ba' to the west side of Glen Forsa. The\r\nother occupies for over three miles the bottom of Glen More, the deep\r\nvalley which, skirting the southern side of the chief group of hills,\r\nconnects the east side of the island by road with the head of the great\r\nwestern inlet of Loch Scridain. There are other minor areas. One of\r\nthese extends for about a mile along the declivities to the south of\r\nSalen, across the valley of the Allt na Searmoin; another occurs at\r\nSalen; a third runs along the shore at Craignure. In the interior also,\r\nmany isolated areas of similar rocks, besides thousands of veins, occur\r\nin the central group of hills and valleys which form the basins of the\r\nGlencannel and Forsa rivers (Map VI.).\r\n\r\nThe chief northern boss, which for the sake of convenience of reference\r\nmay be called that of Loch Ba', has a length of nearly six miles,\r\nwith a breadth varying from a quarter of a mile to about a mile and a\r\nquarter. It descends to within 50 feet of the sea-level, and is exposed\r\nalong the crest of Beinn Fhada at a height of more than 1800 feet.\r\nIt chiefly consists of a grey crystalline rock which might readily\r\nbe identified as a granite, but which when examined microscopically\r\nis found to possess the granophyric structure. With this distinctly\r\ngranular-crystalline rock are associated various porphyritic and\r\nfelsitic masses, which pass into it, and are more specially observable\r\nalong its border. An exceedingly compact black quartz-felsite or\r\nrhyolite forms its southern boundary, runs as a broad dyke-like ridge\r\nfrom the head of the Scarrisdale Water north-eastward across Loch\r\nBa' (Fig. 352), and spreads out eastward into a mass more than a\r\nmile broad on the heights above Kilbeg in Glen Forsa. The sharp line\r\nof demarcation of this felsite, and its mass and extent, point to a\r\ndifferent period of extravasation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 352.--View of the hills on the south side of the\r\nhead of Loch na Keal, showing the junction of the granophyre and the\r\nbedded basalts.\r\n\r\n  One bird, the bedded basalts of the Gribon plateau; two birds,\r\n  the bedded dolerites and basalts of Beinn a' Chraig adhering to\r\n  the northern slope and capping the hill; three birds, summit of\r\n  Ben More, with A'Chioch to the left and the top of Beinn Fhada\r\n  appearing in the middle distance between them; four birds, the\r\n  granophyre slopes of Beinn a' Chraig with the great dyke-like mass\r\n  of felsite on the left.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe geologist, who approaches this district from the north-east, has\r\nhis attention arrested, even at a distance of several miles, by the\r\ncontrast between the outer and inner parts of the hills that lie to the\r\nsouth-west of Loch Ba'. He can readily trace from afar the dark bedded\r\nbasic rocks rising terrace above terrace, from the shores of Loch na\r\nKeal, to form the seaward faces of the hills along the southern side\r\nof that fjord. But he observes that immediately behind these terraces\r\nthe mass of the rising ground obviously consists of some amorphous\r\nrock, which weathers into white debris. Nothing can be sharper than\r\nthe contrast of colour and form between the two parts of the hills.\r\nThe bedded plateau-rocks lie as a kind of wall or veneer against a\r\nsteep face of the structureless interior (Fig. 352). Seen from the\r\nother or hilly side, the contrast is perhaps even more striking.\r\nBut the astonishment with which it is beheld at a distance becomes\r\nintensified when one climbs the slopes, and finds that the sheets of\r\ndolerite and basalt (which from some points of view look quite level,\r\nyet dip towards the north-east at a gentle angle) are immediately\r\nbehind the declivity abruptly truncated by a mass of granophyre. Of\r\nall the junction-lines between the acid bosses and the lavas of the\r\nplateaux, those exposed on these Mull hillsides are certainly the\r\nmost extraordinary. So little disturbed are the lavas, that one's\r\nfirst impulse is to search for pebbles of the granophyre between the\r\nbasalts, for it seems incredible that the inner rock should be anything\r\nbut a central core of older eruptive material, against and round which\r\nthe younger basic rocks have flowed. But, though the granophyre is so\r\ndecomposing and covers its slopes with such \"screes\" of debris, that\r\nhad the basalts been poured round it, they must infallibly have had\r\nsome of its fragments washed down between their successive flows, not a\r\nsingle pebble of it is there to be found. This might not be considered\r\ndecisive evidence, but it is extended and confirmed by the fact that\r\nthe acid rock gives off veins which ramify through the basalts.\r\n\r\nBefore examining the actual contact of the two rocks, however, the\r\ngeologist will not fail to observe here an admirable example of the\r\ngradual change which was described in the foregoing chapter as coming\r\nover the bedded basalts near the acid bosses. As he approaches the\r\nnucleus of white rock, the basalts assume the usual hard indurated\r\ncharacter, not decaying into brown sand as on the plateaux, but often\r\nstanding out as massive crags with vertical clean-cut joint-faces.\r\nThis metamorphosed condition extends in some cases to a considerable\r\ndistance from the main body of acid rock, especially where knobs of\r\nthat material, protruding through the more basic lavas, show that it\r\nmust extend in some mass underneath. Thus along the shore at Saline\r\nthe bedded basalts succeed each other in well-defined sheets, some\r\nbeing solid, massive and non-amygdaloidal, others quite vesicular, and\r\nrecalling the black scoriform surfaces of recent Vesuvian lavas; yet\r\nthey are all more indurated than in the normal plateau-country, and\r\nthey break with a hard splintery fracture. Immense numbers of dykes\r\ncut these rocks, and they are likewise pierced by occasional felsitic\r\nintrusions.\r\n\r\nIf we cross to the other side of the island and trace the bedded\r\nbasalts away from the central masses of acid rock we meet with so\r\ngradual a diminution of the induration that no definite boundary-line\r\nfor the metamorphism can be drawn. As we recede from the centre of\r\nalteration, the rocks insensibly begin to show brown weathered crusts,\r\nwith spheroidal exfoliation, the reticulations of epidote and calcite\r\nbecome much less abundant, the amygdaloids gradually assume their\r\nnormal earthy character, and eventually we find ourselves on the\r\nfamiliar types of the plateau. This transition is well seen along the\r\nshores of Loch na Keal.[401]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 401: Some of the thick massive sheets of basic rock along the\r\nsouth side of this inlet may possibly be altered sills.]\r\n\r\nThese proofs of the alteration of the plateau-basalts are accompanied\r\nin Mull as in Skye by further abundant evidence that the acid rocks are\r\nof younger date than the basic. In particular, dykes and veins may be\r\ntraced proceeding from the former and intersecting the latter. Thus, in\r\nthe bed of the south fork of the Scarrisdale stream, a separate mass\r\nof granophyre (which under the microscope exhibits in perfection the\r\ncharacteristic structure of this rock) protrudes through the basalts\r\nin advance of the main mass, and a little higher up on the outskirts\r\nof that mass narrow ribbons of the granophyre run through the basic\r\nrocks. The contrast of colour between the pale veins of the intrusive\r\nrock and the dark tint of the basalts is well shown in the channel of\r\nthe water. Similar sections may be seen on the flanks of Beinn Fhada,\r\nespecially in the great corry north of Ben More, where the granophyre\r\nsends a tongue of finer grain between the beds of basalt. On the east\r\nside of Loch Ba' numerous proofs of similar intrusion may be observed.\r\nThus at the east end of Loch na Dàiridh, where the granophyre has been\r\nintruded into the basalts, hand-specimens may be obtained showing the\r\ntwo rocks welded together. On the slopes of Cruach Tòrr an Lochain,\r\nwhere the granophyre has a felsitic selvage, the bedded basalts are\r\ntraversed by veins of the latter material (Fig. 353). A little further\r\neast, at the head of the Allt na Searmoin, the bedded basalts, some of\r\nwhich are separated by slaggy scoriaceous surfaces, are intersected by\r\nanother protrusion from the compact felsitic porphyry (Fig. 354).[402] A\r\nmile lower down the same valley a separate mass of granophyre sends out\r\nveins into the basalt, which as usual is dark bluish-grey in colour,\r\nindurated and splintery.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 402: This rock appears to the eye as a black finely\r\ncrystalline-granular felsite. Under the microscope, it was found by\r\nDr. Hatch to \"present a markedly granulitic structure, consisting\r\nmainly of small rounded grains of dirty brown turbid felspar, with\r\nisolated granules of colourless quartz. Scattered through the rock, or\r\naccumulated in patches, are small spherical or drop-like granules of a\r\nbright green augite (coccolite).\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 353.--Section on south side of Cruach Tòrr an\r\nLochain, Mull.\r\n\r\n_a_, bedded basalts and dolerites; _b_, granophyre; _c_, marginal\r\nfiner-grained band; _d_ _d_, veins from the granophyre traversing the\r\nbasic rocks.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 354.--Section at head of Allt na Searmoin, Mull.\r\n\r\n_a_, basalts and dolerites, with slaggy upper surfaces; _b_, felsite.]\r\n\r\nAs the posteriority of the Mull granophyre and felsites to the basalts\r\nis thus proved, the further question remains as to their manner of\r\nintrusion. Here and there, especially on the south-eastern side,\r\nbetween the head of the Scarrisdale river and Loch Ba', the line of\r\njunction between the two rocks is nearly vertical, but a body of black\r\nfelsite intervenes as a huge wall between the ordinary granophyre and\r\nthe basalt. On Beinn Fhada and Beinn a' Chraig the line of separation,\r\nas I have above remarked, is inclined outwards, and plunges under the\r\nbasalts at an angle of 30° to 40°. The terraced basalts and dolerites\r\nare not sensibly disturbed, but end off abruptly against the steep\r\nface of intrusive rock. We might suppose that in this case the younger\r\nrock had merely carried upward the continuation of the beds that are\r\ntruncated by it, as if an orifice had been punched out for its ascent.\r\nBut on the top of the ridge of Beinn a' Chraig we find that the\r\noutliers which there remain are not portions of the lower basalts, but\r\nof the upper \"pale group\" of Ben More. The same rocks are prolonged\r\non the other side of the Scarrisdale Glen, sweep over the summit of\r\nBeinn Fhada, and run on continuously into the crest of A'Chioch and the\r\nupper part of Ben More. The granophyre has usurped the place of the\r\nlower dolerites and basalts, but has left the more felspathic lavas of\r\nthe \"pale group\" in their proper position. And to make this remarkable\r\nstructure still more clear, sections may be seen on the southern flanks\r\nof Beinn Fhada, where the upper surface of the granophyre comes down\r\nobliquely across the edges of the lavas, and allows the junction of the\r\nbasalts and the \"pale group\" to be seen above it (Fig. 355). As in the\r\ncase of Beinn an Dubhaich, it is as if the granophyre had eaten its way\r\nupward and dissolved the rocks which it has replaced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 355.--Section on south side of Beinn Fhada, Mull.\r\n\r\n_a_, bedded basalts and dolerites; _b_, \"pale group\" of Ben More; _c_,\r\ngranophyre.]\r\n\r\nThe usual kind of contact-metamorphism has been produced around this\r\nintrusive boss. It is most marked in the outliers that cap Beinn a'\r\nChraig and on the two ridges to the south-west, where it is seen to\r\nconsist in a high degree of induration, the production of a shattery,\r\nirregularly-jointed structure, and the effacement of the obvious\r\nbedding which characterizes the unaltered rocks.\r\n\r\nThe position of this eruptive mass, quite a mile broad, breaking\r\nthrough, without violently tilting, more than 1800 feet of the bedded\r\nbasalts, and then stopping short about the base of the \"pale group,\"\r\npresents a curious problem to the student of geological physics. It at\r\nonce reminds him of many sections among Palæozoic granites where an\r\neruptive boss has ascended and taken the place of an equivalent volume\r\nof the surrounding rocks, which, though more or less metamorphosed,\r\nare not made to dip away from it as from a solid wedge driven upwards\r\nthrough them. In this Mull case, however, there are some peculiar\r\nfeatures that deserve consideration, for they seem to show that here,\r\nas elsewhere, passages for the uprise of the intrusive rock were\r\nalready provided by the presence of volcanic pipes, which, even if\r\nfilled up with fragmentary materials, would no doubt continue to be\r\npoints of weakness. Round the flanks of the Loch Ba' boss, and here\r\nand there on its surface, patches of intensely indurated volcanic\r\nagglomerate may be detected. A little to the south of the tarn called\r\nLoch na Dàiridh, the granophyre is succeeded by the black, flinty\r\nfelsite or rhyolite already referred to. This rock in some places\r\nexhibits a beautiful flow-structure, with large porphyritic felspars,\r\nand encloses a great many fragments of dolerite and gabbro, varying\r\nfrom the size of a pea up to blocks several inches in diameter. Lying\r\non its surface are detached knolls of much altered dolerite, basalt,\r\nand coarse breccia or agglomerate. On its southern margin one of these\r\npatches of agglomerate contains abundant fragments of various felsitic\r\nrocks, among which are pieces of a compact rock with flow-structure\r\nlike that found in place immediately to the north; also rounded pieces\r\nof quartzite, and of compact and amygdaloidal basalt wrapped up in a\r\nvery hard matrix which seems to consist largely of basalt-dust. No\r\nbedding can be made out in this rock, and the mass looks like part of a\r\ntrue neck. Further down the slope the bedded basalts appear. The actual\r\njunctions of the different rocks cannot be satisfactorily traced, but\r\nthe structure of the ground appears to me to be as shown in Fig. 356.\r\nA patch of similar agglomerate appears a little to the south-west of\r\nthe last section in front of a cliff of the felsite, and seems to\r\nbe enclosed in the latter rock, and other exposures of agglomerate,\r\nunderlain and intensely indurated by the felsite, may be noticed on the\r\nground that slopes towards Loch Ba'.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 356.--Section to south of Loch na Dàiridh, Mull.\r\n\r\n_a_, basalts; _b_, dolerite; _c_, volcanic agglomerate; _d_, black\r\nfelsite; _e_, granophyre.]\r\n\r\nThat these agglomerates do not belong to the period of the eruption of\r\nthe granophyre and felsite, but to that of the bedded basalts, may be\r\ninferred from their intense induration next the acid rocks, and also\r\nfrom the fact that similar breccias are actually found here interposed\r\nbetween the bedded basalts. This is well shown on the hill above the\r\nCoille na Sròine, where the accompanying section can be seen (Fig.\r\n357). The broad dyke-like mass of black flinty felsite already referred\r\nto runs as a prominent rib over the southern end of Beinn a' Chraig\r\ninto the head of the Scarrisdale glen (see Fig. 352). It cuts across\r\nthe bedded basalts, and immediately to the south of where these appear,\r\na thin intercalated bed of breccia crops out, of the usual dull-green\r\ncolour, with abundant fragments of basalt and many of yellow and grey\r\nfelsite.\r\n\r\nFrom these various facts we may, I think, conclude that along the\r\nstrip of ground now occupied by the Loch Ba' boss of granophyre and\r\nfelsite, there once stood a line or group of vents, from which, besides\r\nthe usual basalt-debris, there were ejected many pieces of different\r\nfelsitic or rhyolitic rocks, and that these eruptions of fragmentary\r\nmaterial took place during the accumulation of the plateau-basalts.\r\nThese volcanic funnels occasioned a series of points or a line of\r\nweakness of which, in a long subsequent episode of the protracted\r\nvolcanic period, the acid rocks took advantage, forcing themselves\r\nupwards therein, and leaving only slight traces of the vents which\r\nassisted their ascent. The mingling of acid and basic fragments in the\r\nmaterial ejected from these vents is another proof of the existence\r\nof acid rocks in the volcanic reservoirs before the advent of the\r\ngreat granophyre intrusions. The evidence thus entirely confirms the\r\nconclusions deduced from the Skye area.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 357.--Section of junction of south side of Loch Ba'\r\ngranophyre boss, with the bedded basalts, Mull.\r\n\r\n_a_, bedded basalts; _b_ _b_, basalt-tuff and breccia; _c_, granophyre;\r\n_d_, black felsite; _e_, coarse dolerite dyke, 30 or 40 feet wide.]\r\n\r\nThe second or Glen More boss, instead of rising into hilly ground, is\r\nconfined to the bottom of the main and tributary valleys, and has only\r\nbeen revealed by the extensive denudation to which these hollows owe\r\ntheir origin. It begins nearly a mile below Torness and extends up to\r\nLoch Airdeglais--a distance of almost four miles. Though singularly\r\ndevoid of topographical feature, it exhibits with admirable clearness\r\nthe relation of the granophyres to the gabbros, and thus deserves an\r\nimportant place among the tracts of acid rocks in the Western Islands.\r\nIts petrographical characters change considerably from one part of its\r\nbody to another. For the most part, it is a true granophyre, sometimes\r\nwith orthoclase, sometimes with plagioclase as its predominant\r\nfelspar. At Ishriff, as already stated, it is sprinkled with long\r\nacicular decayed crystals of hornblende; but at the watershed the\r\nferro-magnesian mineral is augite. The surrounding rocks are mainly the\r\nplateau-basalts, with their sills of dolerite and gabbro.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 358.--Mass of dark gabbro about two feet in\r\ndiameter traversed by pale veins of granophyre, lying on north slope of\r\nCreag na h-Iolaire, Mull.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 359.--Section at Creag na h-Iolaire, Glen More,\r\nMull, showing basalts and gabbros resting on and pierced by granophyre.\r\n\r\n_a_, much indurated and altered basalts and dolerites; _b_ _b_, gabbro;\r\n_c_, granophyre; _d_ _d_, basalt dykes.]\r\n\r\nThis strip of granophyre sends abundant apophyses from its mass into\r\nthe dark basic rocks around it. Some of the best sections to show the\r\nnature of these offshoots are to be found on the steep hillslope which\r\nmounts from the watershed in Glen More southward into the Creag na\r\nh-Iolaire (Eagle's Crag), and thence up into the great gabbro ridge of\r\nBen Buy. From the main body of granophyre a multitude of veins ascends\r\nthrough the basalts and gabbros from two feet or more in breadth down\r\nto mere filaments (Fig. 358). Even at a height of 300 feet up the hill\r\nsome of these veins are still three inches broad, and present the\r\nusual granophyric structure, though rather finer in grain than the\r\ngeneral mass of the boss, and sometimes assuming a compact felsitic\r\nand spherulitic texture at the immediate contact with the surrounding\r\nrock. One of the most striking proofs of the posteriority of these\r\nveins is furnished by the perfect flow-structure they not infrequently\r\nexhibit along their margins, their long felspar crystals being arranged\r\nparallel to the walls in lines that follow the sinuosities of the\r\nboundary between the two rocks. Patches of gabbro and of the indurated\r\nbasalts may be seen lying on the granophyre, from which veins and\r\nstrings ramify through them (Fig. 359). Similar veins can be traced\r\nupward into the main body of coarse gabbro, forming the ridge of Ben\r\nBuy. Some of them are of the usual granular granophyric texture, others\r\nare dull and fine-grained (claystones of the older authors).\r\n\r\nHence it is evident that the granophyres of Mull have been protruded\r\nnot only after the accumulation of the plateau-basalts, but after\r\nthese were traversed by the sheets and veins of gabbro. The amount\r\nof acid rock injected into these older rocks over the mountainous\r\npart of the island is enormous; but I reserve further reference to it\r\nfor the section on acid Dykes and Veins, for these are the forms in\r\nwhich it chiefly occurs in that region. It should be added, that in\r\nthe localities here referred to basalt-veins and dykes are generally\r\nabundant, cutting through all the other rocks (Fig. 359). So numerous\r\nare they that the geologist ceases to take note of them when his\r\nthoughts are engaged upon the problems presented by the masses through\r\nwhich they rise.\r\n\r\n\r\niii. THE ACID BOSSES OF SMALL ISLES\r\n\r\nIn the island of Eigg three small bosses or sheets of acid rock occur.\r\nThat at the northern end rises through the Jurassic sedimentary rocks,\r\nand forms a bold cliff from 150 to 200 feet high. It is a light grey\r\ngranophyric porphyry, with rounded blebs of quartz in a micropegmatic\r\nbase of quartz and felspar. The other two masses, of smaller size, cut\r\nthrough the bedded basalts[403] (Map VI.).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 403: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xxvii. (1871) p. 294.]\r\n\r\nIn the opposite island of Rum, the acid protrusions play a much more\r\nimportant part. On the east side of the hills, they occur in sheets at\r\nthe base of the gabbros; on the west side, they form a large tract of\r\nhilly ground, which, stretching along the coast-line for about three\r\nand a half miles from the headland of A' Bhrideanach to Harris, forms\r\nthere a range of shattered sea-cliffs, that tower for 1000 feet above\r\nthe Atlantic breakers that beat about their base. The area extends\r\ninland to the slopes on the west side of Loch Sgathaig, a distance of\r\nabout three and a half miles, descending in a range of precipices along\r\nits northern front, and reaching in its culminating summit, Orval, a\r\nheight of 1868 feet above the sea. The rocks of which this triangular\r\narea consists resemble those of the Mull bosses. They are chiefly\r\nquartz-porphyries, becoming felsitic in texture towards their contact\r\nwith adjacent rocks. In some places, as was noticed by Macculloch on\r\nthe sea-cliffs,[404] they have a rudely bedded structure. Thus on the\r\nnorth-west front of Orval, this structure is shown by parallel planes\r\nthat dip outwards or north-west at 30° to 40°, and which are made\r\nstill more distinct by an occasional intrusive dyke or sheet of basalt\r\nbetween their surfaces. I have already alluded to indications of an\r\ninternal arrangement in the granitoid bosses of Skye (p. 381).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 404: _Western Islands_, vol. i. p. 487.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 360.--Section on north side of Orval, Rum.\r\n\r\n_a_, Torridon sandstones; _b_, bedded basalts of Fionn Chro; _c_,\r\ndolerite; _d_, quartz-porphyry.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 361.--Junction of Quartz-Porphyry (Microgranite)\r\nand Basic Rocks, south-east side of Orval, Rum.\r\n\r\n_a_, basalts and dolerites; _b_, dolerite and gabbro veins; _c_,\r\nquartz-porphyry cutting _a_ and _b_.]\r\n\r\nAs in the other islands, the granophyres, porphyries and felsites\r\nof Rum have been intruded at the base of the volcanic series. Over\r\nmuch, if not all, of their area they lie directly on the red Torridon\r\nsandstone. That the bedded basalts once covered them is indicated\r\nby the position of the three outliers of the basalt-plateau already\r\nnoticed. But a fourth outlier still lies upon the porphyry of Orval\r\nas a cake that dips gently northward. It consists of a bedded, dark,\r\nfinely-crystalline, ophitic dolerite, porphyritic in places, with a\r\nrudely prismatic or columnar structure (Fig. 360). It has undergone\r\ncontact-metamorphism, and tongues from the underlying rock project\r\nup into it. On the south-eastern side of the same hill, still more\r\nstriking evidence is presented of the posteriority of the acid to\r\nthe basic rocks. The porphyry shows here the same tendency to assume\r\na bedded structure, the parallel \"beds\" again dipping outward or\r\nsouth-east at 40°. They plunge under the body of gabbro, dolerite and\r\nother intrusive masses which from this point stretch eastward into the\r\ngreat cones of Allival and its neighbours. The rock at the junction\r\nis a fine microgranite with traces of micropegmatite. It is composed\r\nof a holocrystalline base of quartz and orthoclase, with porphyritic\r\ncrystals of microcline, blebs of quartz and scattered granules of\r\naugite. The rocks that rest immediately next it are basalt and\r\ndolerite, into which it has sent an intricate network of veins (Fig.\r\n361).[405] It has also pushed long tongues down the slope into them,\r\nwhich may be seen traversing the dolerite and gabbro veins that cut\r\nthe basalts. The basic rocks next the porphyry have been intensely\r\naltered. They seem in places as if they have been shattered by some\r\nexplosive force, and had then been invaded by the mass that rushed into\r\nall the rents thus caused. This remarkable structure is still better\r\ndisplayed on St. Kilda, and is more fully described in the following\r\naccount of the geology of that island.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 405: In a thin slice cut from a specimen showing the junction,\r\nthere is a minute vein of the porphyry penetrating the basalt which is\r\nmuch altered, while the porphyry becomes much finer in grain than at a\r\ndistance from the contact.]\r\n\r\n\r\niv. THE ROCKS OF ST. KILDA\r\n\r\nBrief allusions to St. Kilda and its rocks have already been made (pp.\r\n173, 358). We may now enter more fully upon the consideration of its\r\ngeological structure and history.\r\n\r\nWhen the weather is clear there may be seen from the western headlands\r\nof the Outer Hebrides a small blue cone rising above the Atlantic\r\nhorizon at a distance of about 60 miles. As the voyager approaches\r\nthis distant land it gradually shapes itself into a group of islets of\r\nwhich St. Kilda, the largest and only inhabited, has an extreme length\r\nof about four miles, a breadth of less than two miles, and a height of\r\n1262 feet above the sea. Four miles to the north-east Borrera, about\r\none square mile in extent, rises with precipitous sides to a height\r\nof 1000 feet. Off the north-western promontory of St. Kilda the huge\r\nrock of Soay, half a square mile in area, towers from 600 to 800 feet\r\nabove the waves. Borrera has two attendant rocks--Stack Li and Stack\r\nan Armin--huge pyramidal masses several hundred feet high, and the\r\nhome of thousands of gannets. St. Kilda possesses two less imposing\r\nislets between its north-western headland and Soay, and a third to the\r\nsouth-east known as Levenish.\r\n\r\nThe scenery of this picturesque group affords a good indication of its\r\ngeological structure. It displays two distinct types of topographical\r\nform. In Borrera the marvellous combination of spiry ridges, deep\r\ngullies and clefts, notched crests and splintered pinnacles, at once\r\nreminds the visitor of the outlines of the Cuillin Hills of Skye. The\r\nsame features are repeated on a less magnificent scale in Soay and\r\nalong the whole of the south-western precipitous coast-line of St.\r\nKilda.\r\n\r\nIn marked contrast to these varied outlines, the eastern half of St.\r\nKilda rises with a smooth green surface, varied with sheets of grey\r\nscrees, up to the rounded summit of Conagher, the highest point in the\r\nisland. If the dark crags of the rest of the island group remind one of\r\nthe Cuillins, this eastern tract recalls at once the form and colour\r\nof the Red Hills of Skye. A closer examination shows that in each case\r\nthe topography arises from the influence of the very same rocks and\r\ngeological structure as in that island.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one aspect in which St. Kilda has no rival\r\nthroughout the Western Isles. Its russet-coloured cone, though rising\r\non the west side with gentle green slopes from the central valley,\r\nplunges on the eastern side in one vast precipice from a height of\r\n1000 feet or more into the surge at its base. Nowhere among the Inner\r\nHebrides, not even on the south-western side of Rum, is there any such\r\ndisplay of the capacity of the youngest granite to assume the most\r\nrugged and picturesque forms. It is hardly possible to exaggerate the\r\nvariety of outline assumed by the rock as it yields along its system\r\nof joints to the influence of a tempestuous climate. It has been carved\r\ninto huge projecting buttresses and deep alcoves, the naked stone\r\nglowing with tints of orange and fawn colour, veiled here and there\r\nwith patches of bright green slope, or edged with fringes of sea-pink\r\nand camomile. Every outstanding bastion is rent with chasms and split\r\ninto blocks, which accumulate on the ledges like piles of ruined\r\nwalls. To one who boats underneath these cliffs the scene of ceaseless\r\ndestruction which they present is vividly impressive.\r\n\r\nThe geology of St. Kilda was sketched by Macculloch, who recognized\r\nthe close resemblance of its two groups of rock to the \"augite-rock\"\r\n(gabbro) and \"syenite\" (granophyre) of Skye and other islands of\r\nthe Inner Hebrides. But he left the relations of the two groups to\r\neach other undetermined.[406] Professor Heddle has published a brief\r\nreference to the rocks of St. Kilda, without, however, offering any\r\ndefinite opinion as to the geological structure of the islands.[407]\r\nThe best account of the geology has been given by Mr. Alexander Ross,\r\nwho obtained evidence that the acid sends veins into the basic rock.\r\nHe brought away specimens clearly showing this relation, but in his\r\ndescription left the question open for further inquiry.[408] To some of\r\nthe observations in these papers reference will be made in the sequel.\r\nThe following account is based on the results of two visits paid by\r\nme to St. Kilda in the summers of 1895 and 1896, during which I was\r\nenabled to examine the rocks on land, and to sail several times round\r\nthe islands, boating along those parts of the cliffs which presented\r\nfeatures of special geological importance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 406: _Description of the Western Isles_, vol. ii. p. 54.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 407: In an article on the general geological features of\r\nthe Outer Hebrides contributed to _A Vertebrate Fauna of the Outer\r\nHebrides_, by J. A. Harvie-Brown and T. E. Buckley, 1888.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 408: _British Association Report_, 1885, p. 1040, and a much\r\nfuller paper in the _Proceedings of the Inverness Field Club_, vol.\r\niii. (1884), p. 72.]\r\n\r\nIn the St. Kilda islets three groups of rock differing from each other\r\nin age may be recognized. 1st, A series of gabbros, dolerites and\r\nbasalts which have been intruded through and between each other as\r\nsills; 2nd, a mass of granophyre which invades these sills; and 3rd,\r\nabundant dykes and veins of basalt which occur both in the basic and\r\nacid masses.\r\n\r\nFrom the extension of the basalt-dykes across the Outer Hebrides it is\r\nclear that the Tertiary volcanic region reached at least to within 60\r\nmiles of St. Kilda. Whether or not it stretched over the intervening\r\nspace now overflowed by the Atlantic must be matter for conjecture.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the intrusive rocks of St. Kilda are in\r\nage and origin the equivalents of those of the Inner Hebrides. The\r\nremnants left of them were assuredly not superficial extrusions, but\r\nare characteristic examples of the more deep-seated intrusions of the\r\nTertiary volcanic period. Down to the most minute details of structure\r\nthey reproduce the features so well displayed by the gabbros and\r\ngranophyres of Skye, Rum and Mull. If it is demonstrable in the case\r\nof these islands that the intrusions have taken place under a deep\r\ncover of basalt-sheets, now in large part removed, the inference may\r\nlegitimately be drawn that at St. Kilda a basalt-plateau once existed\r\nwhich has been more completely destroyed than in the other regions.\r\nNot a fragment of such a plateau has survived, unless we may perhaps\r\nbe allowed to recognize it in some of the basalts enclosed among the\r\ngabbro-sills. Placed far amid the melancholy main and exposed to the\r\nfull fury of the Atlantic gales, these islets must be regarded as the\r\nmere fragmentary cores of a once much more extensive volcanic area.\r\nThe geologist who visits them is deeply impressed at every turn by the\r\nevidence of the active and unceasing destruction which their cliffs\r\nare undergoing. Nothing now remains save the deep-seated nucleus of\r\nintrusive sills, bosses and dykes.\r\n\r\n1. _The Gabbro Sills._--The rudely-bedded arrangement of these rocks is\r\nconspicuous along the west side of St. Kilda, in Soay and in Borrera.\r\nThey consist of coarse and fine varieties disposed in successive sheets\r\nwhich dip at angles varying from as little as 15° up to as much as 60°\r\nor even more. In St. Kilda they form the picturesque promontory of\r\nthe Dune, and extend thence along the western side of the island to\r\nits extreme northern end. Their escarpments face the ocean, and their\r\ndip-slopes descend towards the north-east in grassy declivities to the\r\nsouth bay and the long verdant glen which runs thence across to the\r\nnorth bay. The same strike is prolonged into Soay, but further east in\r\nBorrera the direction curves so as to present vast escarpments towards\r\nthe west and shelving sheets of rock towards the east.\r\n\r\nNone of the gabbros seen by me are as coarse as the large-grained\r\nvarieties of Skye, nor does there appear ever to be such a marked\r\nbanded structure among them as that displayed by the Cuillin rocks.\r\nFaint banding, however, may be noticed. A series of specimens which\r\nI collected from the west side of the island has been sliced for\r\nmicroscopic examination, and Mr. Harker has furnished me with the\r\nfollowing notes regarding them.\r\n\r\n\"An olivine-gabbro from the west side of St. Kilda [7107] is a\r\ndark, heavy, medium-grained rock, in which augite and felspar are\r\nconspicuous. The microscope shows, in addition, plentiful grains of\r\nolivine, with but little original iron-ore, and some apatite-needles.\r\nThe structure is ophitic, the plates of pale-brown augite enveloping\r\nboth olivine and felspar. A little brown hornblende and red-brown mica\r\nare probably original, the rock showing little sign of alteration. The\r\nfelspar is labradorite, with albite- and Carlsbad-twinning, and forms\r\nelongated rectangular crystals.\r\n\r\n\"Another specimen [7108] is a rock of similar appearance but somewhat\r\ncoarser texture, and structurally is a more typical gabbro than the\r\npreceding, the felspar having little of the 'lath' shape, while the\r\naugite, though still moulded on the felspar, scarcely assumes an\r\nophitic habit. A striking feature in this rock is the way in which\r\nthe augite is crowded with 'schiller'-inclusions, in places so\r\nclosely as to be almost opaque. A high magnification shows that these\r\ninclusions are dark, linear in form, and disposed along two directions\r\nintersecting at a high angle. The labradorite has unusually close\r\ntwin-lamellation on both albite and pericline laws, and it is possible\r\nthat this is a strain-effect.\r\n\r\n\"A third specimen [7109] is from a rock in every respect identical\r\nwith the preceding, except that the olivine is rather more plentiful,\r\nand in some grains is partially serpentinized.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the gabbros of St. Kilda are not a mere uniform boss, but a\r\nseries of sills and irregular masses which have been successively\r\ninjected into each other, they have subsequently been cut through by\r\nmany basalt-dykes and veins. These, which are sometimes as abundant\r\nas in the gabbro of the Cuillin Hills, traverse the rocks both in\r\nthe line of bedding and also at many different angles across it. As\r\nthey generally weather faster than the gabbros, they give rise to\r\ndeep narrow clefts which may be traced up the whole height of the\r\nprecipices, occasioning sea-caves below and sharp notches on the crests\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThese scenic features, so indicative of the geological structure that\r\ncauses them, are specially well seen on the western face of the Dune or\r\nsouth-western promontory of the island, and likewise in the strangely\r\nrifted precipices further north and in Soay. They are, however, most\r\nimpressively displayed around the naked walls of Borrera, which in\r\ntheir marvellous combination of spiry ridges, deep straight gullies,\r\nand splintered crests, remind one at every turn of the scenery of\r\nBlaven and the Cuillin Hills.\r\n\r\n2. _The Granophyre Boss and its Apophyses._--The eastern half of the\r\nisland of St. Kilda consists of a pale rock which Macculloch long ago\r\nidentified with the granophyre of Skye, and which, as he pointed out,\r\nhas much resemblance to parts of the granite of Arran.[409] Not only does\r\nit give rise to topographical forms like those of the Red Hills, but it\r\nweathers, like the Skye granophyre and the Arran granite, into thick\r\nbed-like sheets divided by transverse joints into large quadrangular\r\nblocks. On closer inspection it is found to resemble still more\r\nprecisely the acid rocks of the Inner Hebrides. It possesses the same\r\ndrusy micropegmatitic structure as the granophyres of Skye, Rum and\r\nMull. The ferro-magnesian constituents are present in small quantity,\r\nhence the pale hue of the stone. The quartz and felspar project in\r\nwell-terminated crystals into the drusy cavities, which are sometimes\r\nfurther adorned with delicate tufts of clear crystallized epidote. In\r\nthese and other respects the rock displays the familiar external forms\r\nof the younger or Tertiary granites of Britain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 409: _Description_, vol. ii. p. 54.]\r\n\r\nMr. Harker's notes on the microscopic structure of this granophyre are\r\nas follows:--\"The prevailing felspar is orthoclase, often very turbid\r\nfrom secondary products. Even what appear to be distinct crystals are\r\nsometimes seen in the slices to be invaded on the margin by quartz in\r\nrough micrographic intergrowths, and much of the finer intergrowth\r\noccurs as a fringe to the crystals. In this case the felspar of the\r\nmicropegmatite can often be verified to be in crystalline continuity\r\nwith the crystal which has served as a nucleus [6624]. Quartz occurs\r\nin distinct crystals and grains as well as in the micropegmatite.\r\nThere is a more granitoid variety of the rock, in which only a very\r\nrude approach to micrographic intergrowths is seen [6623]. In both\r\nvarieties there is but little trace of any ferro-magnesian mineral; the\r\nmore typical granophyre has what seems to be destroyed augite, while\r\nthe granitoid rock contains a little deep-brown biotite. Scattered\r\ncrystal-grains of magnetite occur in both.\"\r\n\r\nNarrow ribbon-like veins of a finer material, sometimes only an inch in\r\nbreadth, traverse the ordinary granophyre. Similar veins run through\r\nthe rock of the Red Hills in Skye; they are sharply defined from\r\nthe enclosing rock, as if the latter had already solidified before\r\ntheir intrusion. With regard to the microscopic structure of some\r\nthin slices prepared from these veins, Mr. Harker remarks that \"the\r\nmaterial of the veins is of a type intermediate between granophyre\r\nand microgranite [6622, 6623]. The chief bulk is a finely-granular\r\naggregate of quartz and felspar, the latter very turbid; but in this\r\naggregate are imbedded numerous patches of micropegmatite, often of\r\nperfect and delicate structure. These areas of micropegmatite show\r\nsome approach to a radiate or rudely spherulitic structure, and, in\r\nsome cases, are clustered round a crystal of felspar or quartz. Some\r\ngranules of magnetite and rare flakes of brown biotite are the only\r\nother constituents of the rock. Although they must be of somewhat later\r\ndate, there is evidently nothing in the petrographical characters of\r\nthese fine-textured veins to separate them widely from the ordinary\r\ngranophyres of the region.\"\r\n\r\nThese veins may be compared with the spherulitic dyke that traverses\r\nthe granophyre of Meall Dearg at the head of Glen Sligachan (described\r\nat p. 381), which, though undoubtedly somewhat younger than the rock\r\nthat contains it, yet presents the very same structures as are visible\r\nat the margin of that rock.[410] The material of this dyke and of the\r\nfiner veins of St. Kilda and the Red Hills probably belongs to a later\r\nperiod of protrusion from a deeper unconsolidated portion of the same\r\nacid magma as at first supplied the general body of granophyre.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 410: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. 1. (1894), p. 220.]\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the most interesting feature in the granophyre of St.\r\nKilda is its junction with the mass of basic rock to the west of it.\r\nThis junction-line runs from about the middle of the chief or south\r\nbay (where, however, its precise position is concealed under detritus)\r\nacross the island to the north shore, where it descends the face of the\r\nprecipice and plunges under the sea. Important as the actual contact\r\nof the two rocks obviously is in regard to their relative date, it has\r\nnot hitherto been observed or described. Macculloch noticed \"numerous\r\nfragments of trap penetrated by veins of syenite,\" but he did not see\r\nthese rocks in place, and, in spite of their apparent testimony to the\r\nposteriority of the acid intrusions, he was inclined to believe that\r\nthe veins were not real veins, but that the \"trap\" and \"syenite\" had a\r\ncommon origin and would be found to pass into each other, as he thought\r\nalso occurred in Mull and Rum. In recent years Mr. Alexander Ross,\r\nduring his visit to St. Kilda, collected specimens illustrating the\r\nvarieties of gabbro, dolerite and basalt, and showing the intrusion of\r\nthe acid into the basic rocks. As already stated, he was disposed to\r\nregard the \"granite\" as of younger date than the gabbros, but left the\r\nquestion undecided.[411]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 411: In his paper, _Proceed. Inverness Field Club_, vol.\r\niii. (1884), p. 78, Mr. Ross quotes a letter from Prof. Judd, who\r\nthere states that the rock supposed to be granite \"is seen under the\r\nmicroscope to be a quite different rock--a quartz-diorite.\" Some of\r\nthe specimens from St. Kilda collected by Mr. Ross were exhibited at\r\na meeting of the Geological Society on 25th January 1893. With regard\r\nto these Prof. Judd, in the course of the discussion on his paper on\r\n\"Inclusions of Tertiary Granite in the Gabbro of the Cuillin Hills,\"\r\nremarked:--\"They show a dark rock traversed by veins of a light one,\r\nbut the dark rock is not a gabbro and the light one is not a granite\"\r\n(_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlix. (1893), p. 198).]\r\n\r\nThe best locality for the examination of the junction of the main\r\ngranophyre mass with the gabbros is inaccessible save by boat, and only\r\nin the calmest weather. It occurs in the great cliff on the northern\r\nside of the island between the north bay and the sea-stack known as\r\nthe Bragstack. The line of contact emerges from below the sea-level,\r\nand ascends the cliff with a westward inclination of from 60° to 80°.\r\nHere, as in Skye, the acid rock underlies the basic masses, which are\r\nrudely bedded and much jointed. About 150 feet above the sea-level,\r\nthe nearly vertical cliff breaks up into an exceedingly rocky and\r\nrugged acclivity, across which the junction seems to slope at a lower\r\nangle. But the place is hardly reachable, save perhaps by the intrepid,\r\nbarefooted cragsmen of St. Kilda.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 362.--Junction of granophyre and gabbro, north side\r\nof St. Kilda.]\r\n\r\nAlong the sharply defined line of contact the granophyre is\r\nclose-grained, and sends a network of veins into the dark sheets of\r\ngabbro. The general features of the junction are represented in Fig.\r\n362. The veins are narrow, those nearest the main body of granophyre\r\ndiverging from it at a still more acute angle than those from the\r\nmass of Meall Dearg (Fig. 376), and then branching so as to enclose\r\nmasses of the gabbro and to run across them in long parallel veins.\r\nA characteristic feature of many of these veins, besides their\r\nnarrowness, is their tendency to split up at the ends into mere fingers\r\nand threads as represented in Fig. 363.\r\n\r\nOwing to the depth of soil on the cultivated land, and of boulders and\r\nsand on the beach, the actual junction of the main body of granophyre\r\nwith the gabbro is not seen on the southern shore. But a few yards to\r\nthe westward of where it must lie, the beach is cumbered with large\r\nblocks of rock broken up from the mass, which can be seen _in situ_\r\na little further south forming a line of low cliff with a rugged\r\nforeshore. These rocks consist of various gabbros and basalts of rather\r\nfine grain, profusely traversed with veins of white granophyre. Some\r\nof these veins are two feet or more in breadth, and, when of that\r\nsize, show the distinctive granular texture and drusy structure of\r\nthe main part of the acid rock. But from these dimensions they can\r\nbe traced through every stage of diminution until they become mere\r\nthreads. When they are only an inch or two broad, they assume a finely\r\ngranular texture like that of the veins that run through the body of\r\nthe granophyre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 363.--Veins of granophyre traversing gabbro and\r\nsplitting up into thin threads, north side of St. Kilda.]\r\n\r\nThe amount of injected material in the dark basic rocks is here and\r\nthere so great as to form a kind of breccia (Fig. 364), which, from\r\nthe contrast of tone between its two constituents, makes a conspicuous\r\nobject on the shore. Here, as in the example already cited from Rum,\r\nthe basic rocks seem to have been shattered into fragments, and the\r\nacid material to have been injected into the minutest interstices\r\nbetween them. The enclosed fragments are of all sizes from mere grains\r\nup to blocks a foot or more in length. They are generally angular, like\r\nrock-chips from a quarry. Moreover, they are not all of the same kind\r\nof material. While at this locality most of them consist of basalt,\r\nthey include also a few large and small pieces of rather coarse gabbro.\r\nThere has evidently been a certain amount of transport of material, as\r\nwell as an extensive disruption of the rocks _in situ_. The granophyre\r\nhere and there assumes a darker or greener tint, as if it had dissolved\r\nand absorbed some portion of the older rock.\r\n\r\nStill more astonishing are the sections to be seen on the western\r\ncliffs and rocky declivities of the ridge to the north of the Dune,\r\nat a distance of perhaps 500 or 600 yards westwards from those of\r\nthe South Bay. Here the gabbro-sheets are traversed by a number of\r\nconspicuous white bands, which on examination prove to be veins or\r\ndykes of granophyre. As viewed from the sea, the general disposition\r\nof the two groups of rocks is represented in Fig. 366. The broadest\r\nmass of granophyre breaks out towards the bottom of the precipice, and\r\nslants upward as a sheet intercalated between the gabbro sills, with\r\na breadth of about 40 or 50 feet, but rapidly thinning away in its\r\nascent. One of the bands below it has a breadth of about 15 feet. The\r\nmaterial of these intrusions is a pale fine-grained granophyre like\r\nthat of the South Bay, I did not detect, either here or anywhere else\r\nin St. Kilda, a definite spherulitic structure such as is so common in\r\nthe granophyre dykes of Skye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 364.--Pale granophyre injected into dark basalt,\r\nSouth Bay, St. Kilda.\r\n\r\nThe crags on the further side of the bay are the gabbro sheets of the\r\nDune. (From a photograph by Colonel Evans.)]\r\n\r\nThough the acid intrusions are somewhat irregular both in thickness\r\nand direction, they lie generally parallel to each other in the line\r\nof strike of the bedding of the gabbros. They are no doubt apophyses\r\nfrom the main body of granophyre, which emerges to the surface about a\r\nthird of a mile to the eastward, but may of course be at no great depth\r\nunderneath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 365.--Veins of granophyre traversing a line-grained gabbro and\r\n  scarcely entering a coarse-grained sheet, west side of Rueval, St.\r\n  Kilda.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBesides the broader bands of acid rock, and diverging from them, a\r\ncomplicated network of veins ramifies in all directions through the\r\ngabbros, as at the South Bay. The extraordinary degree to which the\r\nbasic rocks have been shattered into fragments is strikingly displayed\r\nhere, likewise the extreme liquidity of the acid magma, whereby it\r\nwas able to insinuate itself into every chink and cranny. But the\r\nobserver notices that this condition of excessive disruption is not\r\nshared by all the basic sills, and is not attendant upon all the acid\r\ndykes. As an example of this irregular distribution of the structure,\r\nI give the accompanying sketch (Fig. 365), where a fine-grained gabbro\r\nhas been completely broken up and intersected with granophyre veins,\r\nwhile the coarser sheet overlying it has almost entirely escaped.\r\nThe dark basalt-like sheets appear generally to have been much more\r\ndisrupted than the more largely-crystalline varieties. It is noticeable\r\nhere, also, that the fragments entangled in the network of granophyre\r\nveinings do not entirely belong to the rock that has been shattered,\r\nbut sometimes include large and small lumps of different gabbros,\r\nshowing some transference of material with the inrush of the acid magma.\r\n\r\nThough closer in grain where it comes in contact with the gabbro,\r\nthe granophyre never assumes any vitreous texture along its margin.\r\nA series of thin slices, prepared from specimens collected by me in\r\nthe South Bay in the summer of 1895, was examined by Mr. Harker, who\r\nfurnished the following notes regarding them:--\"The basalt traversed\r\nby the granophyre is a fine-textured variety with small porphyritic\r\nfelspars. These latter seem to be usually unaltered, retaining the\r\nglass cavities which in some of the crystals are abundant. The\r\ngroundmass, however, shows minerals of metamorphic origin which must\r\nbe derived mainly from the original augite. A brown mica is the most\r\nconspicuous; but with it are associated some brownish-green hornblende\r\nand certain chloritic and perhaps serpentinous substances. It is\r\nchiefly near the margin of a fragment of basalt that the mica gives\r\nplace to these minerals. The basalt still retains plenty of unaltered\r\ngranules of augite in the central parts of a fragment. It is not\r\ncertain that the secondary minerals named come exclusively from the\r\naugite of the basalt; from their form and mode of occurrence they may\r\nin part have replaced olivine or even rhombic pyroxene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 366.--View of sills and veins of pale granophyre\r\ntraversing dark sheets of gabbro, west side of St. Kilda.\r\n\r\n(From a photograph by Colonel Evans.)]\r\n\r\n\"The acid rock, though styled granophyre above, belongs to a granitoid\r\nvariety of that group of rocks, and has but little indication of\r\nmicrographic structures. Compared with the other granophyres from\r\nSt. Kilda, sliced and examined, these examples show a less acid\r\ncomposition. This is expressed mineralogically in the presence of\r\na somewhat larger proportion of ferro-magnesian minerals and of\r\nsoda-lime felspar. These features might indeed be matched in many\r\nnormal granophyres among the Western Isles, but in the present case it\r\ncan hardly be doubted that they are to be explained, at least in some\r\ndegree, by the acid magma having taken up a certain amount of material\r\nfrom the basalt. Many of these Tertiary granophyres have undoubtedly\r\nbeen modified by the incorporation of pieces of basalt and gabbro,\r\nand a collection made in the Strath district of Skye will furnish\r\nexamples for future study. Professor Sollas's description of similar\r\nphenomena in the Carlingford district has already proved the importance\r\nof this kind of action.[412] In the present instance, both brown mica\r\nand hornblende occur plentifully in the granophyre, and especially\r\nround the basalt fragments. This latter point is conclusive as to the\r\nderivation of the basic material, and further proves a certain degree\r\nof viscosity in the acid magma at the time of its intrusion.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 412: _Trans. Roy. Irish Acad._ vol. xxx. (1894), pp. 477-572.]\r\n\r\nAnother series of specimens which I collected in the following year\r\nwas submitted to Mr. Harker for petrographical determination, and his\r\nobservations on two of the microscopic slices are as follow: \"A breccia\r\nfrom the South Bay, St. Kilda [7105], consists of angular fragments up\r\nto two inches in diameter set in a matrix of grey granophyre of medium\r\ntexture. The fragments belong to two types--one of very close texture\r\n(basalt), the other more evidently crystalline (diabase). Both are cut\r\nby the slice.\r\n\r\n\"The basalt shows very evident metamorphism, its augite being wholly\r\ntransformed into greenish-brown hornblende. The little felspar-laths\r\nand granules of iron-ore seem to be unaltered, though the latter may\r\nperhaps have contributed to the formation of the hornblende. Another\r\nfragment of basalt has some larger crystal-grains of augite, and these\r\nare not converted into hornblende.\r\n\r\n\"The diabase shows a less marked boundary under the microscope, but\r\notherwise has similar characters to the preceding. The striated\r\nfelspar-crystals and grains of iron-ore have not been re-crystallized.\r\nA considerable amount of pale augite remains, but there is also plenty\r\nof deeply-coloured hornblende, both fibrous and compact. This diabase\r\nis certainly an intrusive rock, but the basalt, from its petrographic\r\ncharacter, might be from a lava-flow or from a dyke.\r\n\r\n\"The granophyre is of somewhat coarse texture, the micrographic\r\nstructure being only of a rude type. It is notably richer in the darker\r\nconstituents than is usual in such rocks. Further, the hornblende and\r\nmagnetite tend to cluster in little patches which suggest destroyed\r\nfragments of basic rocks. A grain or two of sphene occur, a mineral\r\nforeign to the normal granophyres.\r\n\r\n\"Another similar specimen [7106] from the same locality shows a basic\r\nrock of coarser texture, approaching some of the gabbros in appearance\r\nand with boundaries in places not very sharply defined. The grey matrix\r\nis again relatively rich in the dark elements, and the manner in which\r\nthey occur in little patches, like nearly obliterated 'xenoliths,'\r\npoints unmistakably to a certain amount of absorption of basic material\r\nby the acid magma, with consequent enrichment in the ferro-magnesian\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\n\"The slice cuts only the acid rock, which is seen to be of granitoid\r\nrather than granophyric structure, though the tendency of the felspar\r\nto enclose quartz-grains is unlike a typical granite. Oligoclase, with\r\ncombined albite- and Carlsbad-twinning, is well represented in addition\r\nto orthoclase, and some zoned crystals seem to be of albite with a\r\nborder of oligoclase. Brown hornblende and a little brown mica are the\r\ncoloured constituents. Magnetite and apatite are also observed.\"\r\n\r\nThe testimony of the rocks of St. Kilda to the posteriority of the\r\ngranophyre to the gabbros and basalts is thus clear and emphatic.\r\nIt entirely confirms my previous observations regarding the order\r\nof sequence of these rocks in Mull, Rum and Skye. But the St. Kilda\r\nsections display, even more strikingly than can be usually seen in\r\nthese islands, the intricate network of veins which proceed from the\r\ngranophyre, the shattered condition of the basic rocks which these\r\nveins penetrate, the remarkable liquidity of the acid magma at the time\r\nof its intrusion, and the solvent action of this magma on the basic\r\nfragments which it enveloped.\r\n\r\n3. _The Basic Dykes._--Reference has already been made to the numerous\r\ndykes by which the gabbros of the St. Kilda group of islets is\r\ntraversed. Similar dykes occur also, though less plentifully, in the\r\ngranophyre. It remains for future observation to determine whether\r\nthere is one series older and another later than the intrusion of the\r\nacid rock. In any case, it is quite certain that the dykes in the\r\ngabbro do not all belong to one period of injection, for frequent\r\nexamples of intersection may be noticed, especially on the cliffs of\r\nBorrera, and also cases of double and even treble dykes which have been\r\nformed by successive infillings within the same fissure. The remarkably\r\nvaried precipices of that island are marked by the long narrow rifts\r\nleft by the weathering of vertical dykes, which, as above remarked, may\r\nbe followed with the eye from the sea-level to the sky-line, ascending\r\nobliquely across the bedding of the gabbro sheets. Another group of\r\ndykes may be traced sloping upward at low angles along the face of\r\nthe cliffs and affording admirable ledges with overarching roofs\r\nfor innumerable gannets, kittywakes and guillemots. Other dykes and\r\nribbon-like veins may be seen traversing the gabbro in many different\r\ndirections, precisely as among the Cuillin Hills. As no similar network\r\nof dykes and veins is to be observed in the granophyre, I am disposed\r\nto regard a large number of these intrusions as older than that rock.\r\nBut I did not observe any actual example of a basic dyke truncated by\r\nthe granophyre.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, however, that an injection of similar dykes and\r\nveins took place after the invasion of the granophyre. These later\r\nintrusions are conspicuously displayed along the cliffs that extend\r\nfrom the gabbro junction on the north side of St. Kilda round the\r\neastern coast into the South Bay. They maintain a general parallelism\r\nand ascend from the sea-level at varying angles of inclination, running\r\nup the pale sea-wall as dark bands. They consist of basalt-rocks, and\r\nmay often be seen to branch and to die out. Like those in the gabbro,\r\nthey are not infrequently compound, being made up of two or three or\r\neven more distinct dykes. This is well seen on the great precipice\r\nbelow Conacher, where the section given in Fig. 367 is displayed. Here\r\nin a vertical height of about 800 or 900 feet, there must be at least\r\nseven dykes, simple and compound. A little further south a triple dyke\r\nmay be seen to be composed of a thick central zone and two thinner\r\nmarginal bands, of which the lower strikes off from the others and\r\nmaintains an independent course through the granophyre (Fig. 368).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 367.--Section of the sea-cliff below Conacher, St.\r\nKilda, showing basic dykes in granophyre.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 368.--Triple basic dyke, sea-cliff, east side of\r\nSt. Kilda.]\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE GRANITE OF ARRAN\r\n\r\nThe northern half of the island of Arran is mainly occupied by one\r\nof the most compact and picturesque groups of granite mountains in\r\nScotland.[413] These heights, rising out of the Firth of Clyde to a\r\nheight of 2866 feet, present, in their spiry and serrated crests, a\r\ncontrast to the smoother contours of the older granitic elevations of\r\nthis country. The granite is surrounded by a ring of schistose rocks,\r\nbelonging to the metamorphic series of the Southern Highlands, save for\r\na short distance on the eastern margin, where it comes in contact with\r\nand indurates the Lower Old Red Sandstone. Macculloch long ago pointed\r\nout that no pebbles of the granite are to be found in the surrounding\r\nconglomerates and red sandstones of Carboniferous and younger age.[414]\r\nGeologists accordingly came to the conclusion that the protrusion of\r\nthe granite took place after Carboniferous time, and hence that it had\r\nno connection with the appearance of the far older granites of the\r\nHighlands. In the year 1873 I gave reasons for believing the granite\r\nto be not only younger than the Carboniferous formations, but to be\r\nreferable with most probability to the Tertiary volcanic series.[415]\r\nThe progress of inquiry has tended to confirm this inference, though\r\nno direct proof of its correctness has been obtained. Two lines of\r\ninvestigation may be pursued, and each leads to the conclusion of the\r\nprobability of the Tertiary age of the granite. One of these proceeds\r\non a comparison of the petrographical characters of the Arran rocks\r\nwith those of undoubted members of the Tertiary series among the\r\nWestern Isles. The other inquiry deals with the relation of the rocks\r\nto each other in the general geological structure of Arran itself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 413: The rocks of Arran have often been described. Besides the\r\nwork of Macculloch above quoted, reference may be made to the paper by\r\nSedgwick and Murchison, _Trans. Geol. Soc._ 2nd Ser. vol. iii. p. 21;\r\nA. C. Ramsay's _Geology of the Island of Arran_, 1841, the paper of\r\nNecker de Saussure quoted on p. 412; J. Bryce's _Geology of Clydesdale\r\nand Arran_, 3rd edit. 1865. The island is at present being surveyed for\r\nthe Geological Survey by Mr. W. Gunn.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 414: _Description of the Western Islands of Scotland_, vol. ii.\r\np. 388.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 415: _Trans. Edin. Geol. Soc._ vol. ii. part iii.]\r\n\r\nMacculloch first remarked the strong lithological resemblance of\r\nthe Arran granite to the \"syenite,\" or granophyre, of Skye and St.\r\nKilda.[416] More recent petrographical investigation, as already stated,\r\nhas furnished additional proofs of the connection between the acid\r\nrocks of these islands. So closely indeed are these rocks linked by\r\nmegascopic and microscopic characters, that the petrologist has no\r\nhesitation in placing them together as probably products of the same\r\nperiod of igneous activity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 416: _Description_, vol. ii. p. 352.]\r\n\r\nFrom the general geological structure of Arran, a further strong\r\nargument may be deduced in favour of the late date of the eruptions\r\nof granite. Good reasons have been given for classing as Permian the\r\nbright red sandstones which occupy much of the central and southern\r\nparts of this island, and include the little volcanic group already\r\nreferred to. These sandstones have been invaded by a complex series of\r\neruptive rocks which would thus be later than the Permian period. No\r\nigneous masses posterior to this period are certainly known in Britain\r\nsave those of Tertiary age. The larger body of granite in the northern\r\nhalf of the island nowhere comes into direct contact with the newer red\r\nsandstones, but these strata are pierced by smaller bodies of granite.\r\nHence, both by the evidence of their internal structure and by the\r\nstratigraphy of the ground, the later igneous rocks of Arran may be\r\nreasonably grouped together as one important and consecutive series,\r\ncomparable in age and general characters with those of Tertiary date in\r\nthe Inner Hebrides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 369.--Jointed structure of the granite near the top\r\nof Goatfell Arran.\r\n\r\n(From a photograph by Mr. W. Douglas, lent by the Scottish\r\nMountaineering Club.)]\r\n\r\nThe igneous rocks of Arran, later than the probably Permian sandstones,\r\nrange from acid to basic in composition. Besides the northern granite,\r\nthere are in the southern part of the island acid rocks that include\r\ngranite, coarse-grained quartz-porphyry and fine-grained felsite. Where\r\nthe relations of these rocks to each other can be seen, the felsite is\r\nfound by Mr. Gunn to be newer than the porphyry, into which it sends\r\nsills and dykes.\r\n\r\nA feature observed by the same geologist in Arran offers a further\r\npoint of resemblance to the acid sills and dykes of Skye. He has\r\nnoticed that accompanying the quartz-porphyry of Drumadoon and Bennan,\r\na mass of basic rock forms a kind of fringe or selvage round it,\r\nsometimes with what appears to be a rock of intermediate character\r\nbetween them. Basic sills are abundant south of Glen Ashdale, though\r\nto the west of Whiting Bay most of the intrusive sheets are of acid\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nSome of the quartz-porphyry sheets are markedly columnar. One of\r\nthem, near Corriegills, displays a divergent grouping of the prisms,\r\nnot unlike parts of the pitchstone sheets of Eigg and Hysgeir, and\r\nsuggestive of the rock having flowed along a hollow like that of a\r\nvalley. No certain trace, however, has been found of any Tertiary\r\nlava-stream in Arran, nor has evidence of tuffs been detected in\r\nany part of the younger igneous series. All the rocks appear to be\r\nintrusive, though so abundant and varied are they as to indicate that\r\nthey belong to a vigorous eruptive centre, which may have poured out at\r\nthe surface lavas and ashes, since entirely removed by denudation.\r\n\r\nThe numerous basic dykes for which the south end of Arran has long\r\nbeen celebrated have a general northerly trend, and appear to be all\r\nof the same or nearly the same age. They undoubtedly cut through the\r\nquartz-porphyries and the coarse-grained basic sills, but are less\r\nnumerously visible in the finer-grained basic sills, while in the\r\nfelsitic sheets they are seldom to be seen. In several places dykes\r\nrunning in an E.N.E. direction cut the others, and are therefore of\r\nlater date.[417] The compound dykes of Tormore on the west side of the\r\nisland have been already noticed (p. 161).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 417: _Ann. Rep. of Geol. Surv._ for 1894, p. 286.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE NORTH-EAST OF IRELAND\r\n\r\nIn the north-eastern counties of Ireland there are two regions which\r\nafford ample material for discussion in connection with the protrusion\r\nof acid rocks during the Tertiary volcanic period. One of these, which\r\nfor distinction may be called the Carlingford region, embraces the\r\ntract of country which includes the Mourne Mountains on the north-east\r\nside of Carlingford Lough and the ranges of Slieve Foye and Slieve\r\nGullion on the south-west side. The other lies mainly within the\r\nbasaltic plateau, the largest of its scattered portions forming parts\r\nof the hills of Carnearny and Tardree in the county of Antrim (Map\r\nVII.).\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Carlingford Region\r\n\r\na. _The Mourne Mountains._--This compact and picturesque group of\r\nhills, about twelve miles long and six miles broad, and reaching a\r\nheight of 2798 feet in Slieve Donard, presents a comparatively simple\r\ngeological structure, since it consists almost entirely of granitic\r\nrocks which pierce, overlie and underlie Upper Silurian grits\r\nand shales. So far as regards the contact of these rocks with the\r\ndisrupted sedimentary formations, all that can be asserted is that\r\nthe granite must be later than at least the older part of the Upper\r\nSilurian period. But for at least two reasons, the eruptive rocks\r\nmay be regarded with some confidence as part of the Tertiary series.\r\nIn the first place, there is a strong petrographical resemblance\r\nbetween the Mourne Mountain granite and that of the Island of Arran\r\nand the granitic parts of the granophyre of the Western Isles. And\r\nthis resemblance is so close as to furnish a cogent argument in favour\r\nof grouping all these rocks together as parts of one geologically\r\ncontemporaneous series. In the second place, the Mourne Mountain\r\ngranite abruptly cuts off a large number of basic dykes which, running\r\nin a general N.N.W. direction, may be looked upon as almost certainly\r\nmembers of the Tertiary system of protrusions.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the granite of the district behaves towards certain\r\ndetached areas of Silurian strata with their accompanying dykes is one\r\nof the most astonishing features in the whole assemblage of intrusive\r\nrocks in Britain. As has been excellently shown in the Geological\r\nSurvey Map and sections by Mr. W. A. Traill, the granite has carried up\r\non its surface broad cakes of vertical Silurian strata, together with\r\nall their network of dykes.[418] A cake of this kind, from 50 to about\r\n200 feet thick and nearly two miles broad, has been bodily uplifted\r\nfrom the rest of the mass and carried upward by the granite, so that\r\nthe truncated ends of the beds of grit and shale with their system of\r\ndykes stand upon a platform of granite, from which also numerous veins\r\npenetrate them. There can be little doubt that the basic dykes thus\r\nbroken through are parts of the great Tertiary system, and if so, the\r\ngranite which disrupts them cannot be older than Tertiary time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 418: See Sheets 60, 61 and 71 of the one-inch map of the\r\nGeological Survey of Ireland, and Sheets 22, 23 and 24 of the\r\nHorizontal Sections. The Explanation to these Sheets of the map was\r\nwritten by Professor Hull, Mr. Traill having previously retired from\r\nthe service. The Mourne Mountain area is now undergoing critical\r\nrevision by Prof. Sollas for the Geological Survey, and important\r\nadditional material for the elucidation of this district may be\r\nexpected from him.]\r\n\r\nBesides the older basic dykes disrupted by the granite, a younger but\r\nmuch less abundant series traverses that rock, and also follows a\r\ngeneral north-westerly direction. These later dykes in some cases cross\r\nmore acid dykes which have risen through the granite. There is no trace\r\nof any superficial discharge from the Mourne Mountain area. But from\r\nthe analogy of other districts we may easily conceive that the granite\r\nrepresents the underground parts of volcanic material which has now\r\nbeen entirely removed.\r\n\r\nb. _Slieve Foye and Barnavave District._--This area embraces the\r\nmountainous ground lying between Carlingford Lough and Dundalk Bay, and\r\nculminating in Slieve Foye (1935 feet). It measures roughly about six\r\nmiles in extreme length and four miles in breadth.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable assemblage of basic and acid materials in this area\r\nhas received considerable attention from geologists. The relative\r\norder of the two groups of rocks was first clearly recognized by\r\nGriffith, who showed that the granite (granophyre) is intruded into the\r\ngabbro.[419] Professor Haughton subsequently confirmed this observation,\r\nand proved the post-Carboniferous date of the intrusive materials,\r\nwhich he compared with those of Skye.[420] The general distribution of\r\nthe rocks was traced out in some detail by the Geological Survey, and\r\ndescribed in the official _Memoirs_.[421] More recently the district\r\nhas been examined by Professor Sollas, who, bringing the photographic\r\ncamera and the microscope to the aid of field-geology, has elucidated\r\nthe structure and relations of the rocks, and has obtained abundant\r\nevidence that the acid and basic rocks maintain there the same relative\r\norder as among the Inner Hebrides.[422]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 419: _Journ. Geol. Soc. Ireland_ (1843), p. 113.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 420: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xii. (1856), p. 171; xiv.\r\np. 300; and _Journ. Geol. Soc. Ireland_ (1876), p. 91.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 421: Sheet 71 of the Geol. Surv. Ireland, and accompanying\r\nExplanation. These were the work of Mr. W. A. Traill.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 422: _Trans. Roy. Irish Acad._ vol. xxx. (1894), p. 477. This\r\nis part i. of what is intended to be a series of papers.]\r\n\r\nOne of the first features in this tract of country to arrest the eye of\r\nthe geologist is the situation of this centre of protrusion and that\r\nof Slieve Gullion along a north-west line, coincident with the general\r\ndirection of the numerous basic dykes of the region. Whether or not the\r\nsuccessive intrusions took place contemporaneously in the two areas,\r\nthey have followed each other in the same order. In the Barnavave\r\ndistrict the igneous rocks occupy an area of about 20 square miles.\r\nThey consist of a central and chief mass composed of acid materials,\r\nwhich have risen through the basic rocks now found as an interrupted\r\nring round them.\r\n\r\nIn his more recent examination, Prof. Sollas has devoted special\r\nattention to the influence of the solvent action of the acid magma\r\nupon the basic rocks and upon its own composition and structure.\r\nBesides confirming the work of previous observers as to the order of\r\nappearance of the two kinds of material, he has obtained evidence that\r\nthe gabbro had not only completely solidified, but was traversed by\r\ncontraction-joints, possibly even fractured by earth-movements, before\r\nthe injection of the granophyric material. He found that this material,\r\nlike that of the Inner Hebrides and St. Kilda, must have been in a\r\nstate of great fluidity at the time of its intrusion, and made its way\r\ninto the minutest cracks and crevices. In observing the solvent action\r\nof the granophyre, he ascertained that this action took place even in\r\ncomparatively narrow dykes, which probably consolidated at no great\r\ndepth beneath the surface.[423]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 423: _Op. cit._]\r\n\r\nc. _The Slieve Gullion District._--This area is separated from that\r\njust described by a narrow strip of Silurian strata, so that its\r\nisolation as a separate igneous district is complete. It will be\r\nobserved from the map to continue the same north-westerly line as the\r\nSlieve Foye tract, the two together running in that direction for a\r\ndistance of some 16 miles. It is interesting to note the adoption of\r\nthis predominant north-westerly trend even by eruptive masses which\r\nwere mainly of acid material.\r\n\r\nThis district measures about ten miles in length by from one to five\r\nmiles in breadth. The rocks are, on the whole, similar to those in the\r\narea south of Carlingford Lough, and bear the same relation to each\r\nother, the acid being intrusive in the basic series. It is worthy of\r\nremark that the Tertiary eruptive rocks have made their appearance in\r\nthe midst of the older granite of Newry. This granite has been already\r\nalluded to as disrupting Upper Silurian strata, and being probably\r\nof the age of the Lower Old Red Sandstone (vol. i. p. 290). In long\r\nsubsequent ages, after protracted denudation, during which its cover\r\nof Silurian and Carboniferous formations was stripped off and it was\r\nlaid bare, it was broken through by the whole series of basic and acid\r\nprotrusions of Slieve Gullion.\r\n\r\nThis district is portrayed on Sheets 59, 60, 70 and 71 of the\r\nGeological Survey of Ireland, which show a central core of basic and\r\nacid material piercing the Newry granite.[424] Round this core and\r\ntouching it at its north-western and south-eastern end, but elsewhere\r\nseparated from it by a space of several miles, runs a curiously\r\ncontinuous band of igneous material which is marked as \"quartziferous\r\nporphyry\" and \"felstone-porphyry\" on the Survey maps.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 424: The ground was chiefly mapped and described by Mr. Joseph\r\nNolan and Mr. F. W. Egan.]\r\n\r\nThe south-western portion of this elliptical ring possesses a peculiar\r\ninterest from its including certain remarkable masses of breccia\r\nor agglomerate. These rocks have been mapped by Mr. Nolan, and are\r\ndescribed by him in the official _Explanation_, but in more detail in\r\ntwo separate papers.[425] Having had an opportunity of paying a brief\r\nvisit to the ground, I can confirm the general accuracy of his mapping\r\nand description, and am able to add a few further particulars to the\r\nfacts enumerated by him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 425: Sheet 70 of the Geol. Surv. Map of Ireland and Explanation\r\nthereto; also _Journ. Roy. Geol. Soc. Ireland_, vol. iv. (1877), p.\r\n233; _Geol. Mag._ 1878.]\r\n\r\nThe tract of ground where these agglomerates appear forms a prominent\r\nridge which rises several hundred feet above the lower country on\r\neither side, and extends in a W.N.W. direction for about seven miles,\r\nnearly along the line of junction between the Newry granite and the\r\nSilurian strata. The ridge has a breadth varying from a few hundred\r\nyards to upwards of a mile. It is separated from the main igneous mass\r\nof the Slieve Gullion area by an intervening strip of lower ground from\r\nthree-quarters of a mile to about a mile and a half in width, which is\r\noccupied by the Newry granite. At the north-west end of the ridge the\r\nnewer eruptive rocks lie within the area of that granite, while at the\r\nsouth-east end they rise entirely amongst the Silurian strata.\r\n\r\nBeginning at the south-eastern extremity, we find the agglomerate\r\noccupying several detached eminences and surrounded by altered\r\nSilurian grits and shales. Further west the rock occurs in larger and\r\nmore continuous masses, appearing at intervals, especially along the\r\nsouthern borders of the quartz-porphyry which forms by much the greater\r\npart of the ridge. Actual junctions of the agglomerate with the older\r\nrocks around seem to be seldom visible. I found one, however, above\r\nthe gamekeeper's house on the southern flanks of the hill called\r\nTievecrom. The Upper Silurian grits and shales, in a much indurated and\r\nshattered condition, are there traceable for several hundred feet up\r\nthe slope, until they are abruptly cut off by the agglomerate. The line\r\nof separation appears to be nearly vertical, the truncated ends of the\r\nstrata being wrapped round by the mass of fragmental material.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable features of this agglomerate, which has been well\r\ndescribed by Mr. Nolan, are the notable absence of truly volcanic\r\nstones in it, and the derivation of its materials from the rocks\r\naround it. I found only one piece of amygdaloid, but not a single lump\r\nof slag, no bombs, no broken fragments of lava-crusts, and no fine\r\nvolcanic dust or enclosed lapilli. The rock may be said to consist\r\nentirely of fragments of Silurian grits and shales where it lies\r\namong these strata, and of granite where it comes through that rock.\r\nBlocks of these materials, of all sizes up to two feet in breadth, are\r\nconfusedly piled together in a matrix made of comminuted debris of the\r\nsame ingredients.\r\n\r\nThe agglomerate on the ridge of Carrickbroad has no definite boundary,\r\nbut seems to graduate into an andesitic rock, and then into a\r\nquartz-felsite or rhyolite. This apparent gradation is one of the\r\nmost singular features of the ridge. The andesite resembles some of\r\nthe \"porphyrites\" of the Old Red Sandstone. It is close-grained,\r\nwith abundant minute felspar-laths, and numerous large porphyritic\r\nfelspars, which latter are sometimes aggregated in patches, as in the\r\nold porphyries of Portraine, Lambay Island and the Chair of Kildare.\r\nThis rock has undoubtedly been erupted at the time of the formation of\r\nthe agglomerate, or at least before the loose materials were compacted\r\ntogether; for it is full of separate stones of the same materials, and\r\nbecomes so charged with them as to become itself a kind of agglomerate,\r\nwith a small proportion of andesitic matrix cementing the blocks.\r\n\r\nA thin slice prepared from one of the specimens obtained by me\r\nfrom this hill has been studied by Mr. Watts, who reports that the\r\nfine-grained andesitic matrix in which the stones are imbedded has\r\noften been injected into their minute fissures, and that the minute\r\nfragments enclosed in this matrix consist here of a trachyte-like\r\nporphyry, felsite, andesites, basalts of various degrees of fineness\r\nand olivine-basalt, together with isolated grains of felspar, such as\r\nmight have been derived from the breaking up of some of these fragments.\r\n\r\nWestward from Carrickbroad, the chief eruptive rock is a dark,\r\nsometimes nearly velvet-black, flinty, occasionally almost resinous,\r\nquartz-porphyry or rhyolite, with abundant quartz and large felspars\r\nand occasional well-marked flow-structure. This material, near the\r\nmuch smaller protrusion of andesite, is curiously mixed up with that\r\nrock, as if the two had come up together. Sometimes they seem to\r\npass into each other, at least the separation between them cannot\r\nbe sharply drawn. There can be little doubt, however, that the acid\r\nmagma continued to ascend after the other, for it sends veins and\r\nstrings into the more basic material, and encloses blocks of it. This\r\nthoroughly acid porphyry plays the same part as the andesite in regard\r\nto the stones of the agglomerate. Throughout its whole extent, it is\r\nfound to enclose these stones, which here and there become so numerous\r\nas to form the main bulk of the mass, leaving only a limited amount of\r\nquartz-porphyry (rhyolite) matrix to bind the whole into an exceedingly\r\ncompact variety of breccia. Occasionally the acid rock cuts through the\r\nordinary clastic agglomerate, as may be well seen on the southern face\r\nof Tievecrom.\r\n\r\nA specimen of this porphyry with its enclosed fragments, which was\r\ncollected by me from above the old tower at Glendovey, Carrickbroad,\r\nhas been sliced and examined by Mr. Watts under the microscope, and is\r\nthus described by him: \"The large fragment in this slide consists of\r\nophitic olivine-dolerite full of large phenocrysts of olivine. It is\r\nbroken up and penetrated by veins of quartz-porphyry, rich in quartz,\r\nwhich exhibits a beautiful flow-structure. The felspars and augite of\r\nthe dolerite do not appear to have suffered much alteration at the\r\nmargin of the fragment, but the olivines are much serpentinized, the\r\nserpentine passing into a border of actinolite which runs in veins into\r\nthe neighbouring rock and even passes out into the quartz-porphyry at\r\nthe junction, impregnating it with actinolite and chlorite for some\r\ndistance. A few particles of basalt also occur and a portion of a\r\ngranite-fragment comes into the slide, from the edge of which a piece\r\nof biotite has floated off into the quartz-porphyry.\"\r\n\r\nThe essentially non-volcanic material of the agglomerate shows, as Mr.\r\nNolan pointed out, that it was produced by æriform explosions, which\r\nblew out the Silurian strata and granite in fragments and dust. These\r\ndischarges probably took place either from a series of vents placed\r\nalong a line of fissure running in a north-westerly line, or directly\r\nfrom the open fissure itself. Possibly both of these channels of escape\r\nwere in use; detached vents appearing at the east end and a more\r\ncontinuous discharge from the fissure further west.\r\n\r\nAfter the earliest explosions had thrown out a large amount of\r\ngranitic and Silurian detritus, andesitic lava rose in the fissure,\r\nand solidifying there enclosed a great deal of the loose fragmentary\r\nmaterial that fell back into the chasm. Subsequently, and on a more\r\nextensive scale, a much more acid magma ascended from below, likewise\r\ninvolving and carrying up a vast quantity of loose stones, among which\r\nare pieces of basalt and dolerite.\r\n\r\nNo evidence remains as to the extent of the material discharged\r\nover the surface from this fissure. Denudation has removed all the\r\nsurrounding fragmental sheets as well as any lava that may have flowed\r\nout upon or become intercalated among them. There remains now only\r\nthe cores of the little necks at the east end, and the indurated\r\nagglomerate and lava that consolidated along the mouth of the fissure\r\nor vents.\r\n\r\nThis is the only example of such a line of fissure-eruption which\r\nhas yet been met with in the British Isles. Its connection with the\r\neruptive masses of Slieve Gullion and Carlingford links it with\r\nthe Tertiary volcanic series. But no evidence appears to remain\r\nregarding the epoch in the long volcanic period when the eruptions\r\nfrom it took place. They may possibly date back to the time of the\r\nplateau-basalts; but the abundant acid magma, which constitutes one of\r\ntheir distinguishing characteristics, suggests that they more probably\r\nbelong to the later time when the main protrusions of acid material\r\ntook place. They suggest that coeval with the uprise of the great domes\r\nof Slieve Gullion, Carlingford and the Mourne Mountains there may have\r\nbeen many superficial eruptions of which, after prolonged denudation,\r\nall trace has now been effaced.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Antrim Region\r\n\r\nReference was made in Chapter xxxvii. to the occurrence of rhyolitic\r\nconglomerate and tuff between the lower and upper series of basalts in\r\nthe Antrim plateau, and to the evidence furnished by these detrital\r\ndeposits either that masses of rhyolite appeared at the surface, or\r\nthat rhyolitic ashes were discharged from volcanic vents in the long\r\ninterval that elapsed between the two groups of basalt. The further\r\nconsideration of this question, and an account of the rhyolite bosses,\r\nwere reserved for the present chapter, that they might be taken in\r\nconnection with the other acid eruptions of Tertiary time in Britain.[426]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 426: For an early account of the Antrim trachytic rocks, see\r\nBerger, _Trans. Geol. Soc._ iii. (1816), p. 190. Professor Hull has\r\ndescribed the Tardree rock in the Explanation to Sheets 21, 28 and 29,\r\n_Geol. Survey of Ireland_ (1876), p. 17, and has supposed it to be\r\nolder than the basalts, referring it to the Eocene period (_Physical\r\nGeology and Geography of Ireland_, 2nd edit. (1891), pp. 87, 95).\r\nDuffin (quoted by Mr. Kinahan) believed that \"the trachytes occur at\r\nthe centre of eruption, and were probably poured out at the end of the\r\noutburst.\" Du Noyer also (quoted by the same writer) thought them to be\r\nnewer than the plateau-basalts, and to have lifted up masses of these\r\nrocks. Mr. Kinahan himself (_Geology of Ireland_, p. 172) has pointed\r\nto the absence of any rhyolitic fragments between the basalts as an\r\nargument against the supposed antiquity of the acid protrusions. A\r\npetrographical account of the Tardree rock is given by Von Lasaulx in\r\nthe paper already cited, Tschermak's _Min. Pet. Mittheil._ (1878), p.\r\n412. A more elaborate discussion of the petrography by Prof. Cole will\r\nbe found in the Memoir above referred to (_Scientif. Trans. Roy. Dublin\r\nSoc._ vol. vi. 1896), and the geological relations of the rocks are\r\ndiscussed by him in another shorter paper, _Geol. Mag._ (1895), p. 303.\r\nSee also Mr. M'Henry on the trachytic rocks of Antrim, _Geol. Mag._\r\n(1895), p. 260, and _Proc. Geol. Assoc._ vol. xiv. (1895), p. 140.]\r\n\r\nWith one exception, all the known protrusions of acid material in the\r\nAntrim area lie within the limits of the basalt-plateau (see Map. No.\r\nVII.). They occur along a line at intervals for a distance of about 17\r\nmiles, from Templepatrick to a point four miles north of Ballymena.\r\nIt is worthy of remark that here again the line of protrusion has a\r\nnorth-west trend. It not improbably indicates the position of a fissure\r\nup which the acid material rose at various points.\r\n\r\nThe petrography of the rocks has been frequently discussed. They\r\ninclude several varieties of rhyolite, generally rather coarsely\r\ncrystalline, but sometimes becoming compact, and even passing into\r\ndark obsidian. No undoubted tuff occurs associated with them in any of\r\nthe exposures, nor do the rhyolites anywhere display structures that\r\npoint to their having flowed out at the surface.[427] That the masses now\r\nvisible may have communicated with the surface is quite conceivable,\r\nbut what we now see appears in every case to be a subterranean and not\r\na superficial part of the protrusion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 427: At Sandy Braes an exposure is visible of what at first\r\nmight be thought to be a volcanic conglomerate, but closer examination\r\nshows the rock to consist of obsidian, which decomposes into a\r\nclay, leaving round sharply-defined glassy cores enclosed in the\r\ndecayed material. The \"banded rhyolites\" do not exhibit any kind of\r\nflow-structure that may not be met with in dykes and bosses. Nor have\r\nany satisfactory traces been found of vesicular or pumiceous bands such\r\nas might mark the upper surfaces of true lava-streams. Professor Cole\r\nhas described what he calls \"The Volcanoe of Tardree\" (_Geol. Mag._\r\nJuly 1895). If the Tardree mass ever was a volcano, which is far from\r\nimprobable, its superficial ejections have long ago disappeared. At\r\nleast, after the most diligent search, I have been unable to discover\r\nany trace of them, all that now remains appearing to me to be the neck\r\nor core of protruded material.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 370.--Intrusive rhyolite in the Lower Basalt group\r\nof Antrim, Templepatrick.\r\n\r\n1 1, Chalk; 2 2, Gravel; 3 3, Bedded basalt; 4 4, Rhyolite, intrusive.]\r\n\r\nMost of the rhyolitic exposures are extremely limited in area--mere\r\nlittle knobs, sometimes rising in the middle of a bog, and never\r\nforming conspicuous features in the landscape. The relation of these\r\nrocks to the basalts are generally concealed, but the isolation of\r\nthe small rhyolitic patches leaves no doubt that they are intrusive\r\nas regards the surrounding basalts. This relation is well seen at\r\nTemplepatrick, where it was first observed by Mr. M'Henry of the\r\nGeological Survey (Fig. 370). The rhyolite there forms a sill which has\r\nbeen thrust between the basalts and the gravel that underlies them, the\r\nbasalts being bent back and underlain by the acid rock.[428]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 428: The progress of quarrying operations during the last eight\r\nyears has somewhat destroyed the section as exposed in 1888. But we now\r\nsee that the basalt has not only been bent back but is underlain by the\r\nacid rock.]\r\n\r\nThe largest and most interesting of the Antrim rhyolite tracts covers a\r\nspace of about ten square miles in the heart of the basalt-plateau to\r\nthe north-east of the town of Antrim. It rises to about 1000 feet above\r\nthe sea, and forms a few featureless hills, some of which are capped\r\nwith basalt. The best known localities in this tract are Tardree and\r\nCarnearny. The rock is chiefly a somewhat coarse-textured lithoidal\r\nrhyolite, but includes also vitreous portions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 371.--Section across the southern slope of\r\nCarnearny Hill, Antrim.\r\n\r\n_a_ _a_ _a_, bedded basalts; _b_, rhyolite.]\r\n\r\nOwing to the cover of soil and turf, the junction of this mass with\r\nthe surrounding basalts cannot be so clearly seen as in the sections\r\nof the Inner Hebrides, and hence the stratigraphical relations of\r\nthe two groups are apt to be misunderstood. What is actually seen is\r\nrepresented in Fig. 371. The lithoidal rhyolite emerges from underneath\r\nthe basalts which abut against its sloping surface, forming on the\r\nnorth side of Carnearny Hill a steep bank about 150 feet above the more\r\ngently inclined slope below. The basalts consist of successive nearly\r\nlevel sheets of compact and amygdaloidal rock.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that only two explanations of this section are possible.\r\nEither the rhyolite was in existence before the basalts which flowed\r\nround it and gradually covered it, or it has been erupted through these\r\nrocks, and is therefore of later date.\r\n\r\nThe former supposition has been the more usually received. The rhyolite\r\nhas been supposed to form the summit of an ancient volcanic dome,\r\nperhaps of Eocene age, which had been worn down before the outflow\r\nof the plateau-basalts under which it was eventually entombed. Had\r\nthis been the true history of the locality, it is inconceivable that\r\nof a rock which decays so rapidly as this rhyolite, and strews its\r\nslopes with such abundance of detritus, not a single fragment should\r\noccur between the successive beds of basalt which are supposed to have\r\nsurrounded and buried it. Though the several beds of basalt are well\r\nexposed all round, I could not, on my first visit, find a trace of any\r\nrhyolitic fragments between them, nor had Mr. Symes, who mapped the\r\nground in detail for the Geological Survey, been more successful. I\r\nhave since made a second search with Mr. M'Henry, but without detecting\r\na single pebble of the acid rock among the basalts. Yet it is clear\r\nfrom the upper surfaces of some of these lavas that a considerable\r\ninterval of time separated their successive outflows, so that there was\r\nopportunity enough for the scattering of rhyolite-debris had any hill\r\nof that rock existed in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nAgain, little more than a mile to the east of Carnearny Hill, an\r\noutlier of the basalts forming the prominent height of the Brown Dod\r\nlies upon and is completely surrounded by the rhyolite, which along the\r\neast side of the hill can be traced as it passes under the level sheets\r\nof basalt. The line of junction ascends and descends on that flank of\r\nthe outlier, so that successive flows of basalt are truncated by the\r\nacid rock. But I could find no rhyolitic debris between them.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me, therefore, that the relations between the two groups\r\nof rock in this area are similar to those between the granophyres and\r\nbedded basalts on the south side of Loch na Keal in Mull (p. 396). In\r\nother words, the rhyolites have risen through the basalts, and are\r\ntherefore younger than these lavas. This conclusion is corroborated\r\nby the actual proofs of the intrusion of rhyolite into the basalts at\r\nTemplepatrick.\r\n\r\nAll the known rhyolitic masses in Antrim are confined to the Lower\r\ngroup of basalts.[429] And as they traverse some of its highest\r\nmembers, they may be regarded as certainly younger than that group.\r\nMr. M'Henry, who first indicated this relation, suggested that the\r\nrhyolites were erupted in the interval between the two basaltic\r\nseries, and he connected with their eruption the rhyolitic detritus\r\nfound in association with the iron-ore at so many places in Antrim. It\r\nappears to me that this suggestion carries with it much probability.\r\nThe rhyolitic conglomerate of Glenarm proves that, in the long period\r\nrepresented by the iron-ore and its associated group of sedimentary\r\ndeposits, there were masses of rhyolite at the surface, the waste of\r\nwhich could supply such detritus. The resemblance between the material\r\nof that conglomerate and the rhyolites now visible at Tardree and\r\nelsewhere is so close that we cannot doubt that, if not derived from\r\nsome of the known rhyolitic protrusions, this material certainly came\r\nfrom exposed masses that had the same general petrographic characters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 429: The only exception to this rule was believed to be that\r\nof the mass at Eslerstown, four miles east of Ballymena, which, as\r\noriginally mapped, was shown as crossing from the Lower into the Upper\r\nbasalts. Mr. M'Henry, however, has recently ascertained that the acid\r\nrock is entirely restricted to the area of the older group.]\r\n\r\nWhile the rhyolite pebbles in the Glenarm conglomerate are distinctly\r\nrounded and water-worn, showing that some prominences of acid rock were\r\nundergoing active denudation at the time when this conglomerate was\r\nlaid down, the finer rhyolitic detritus in the tuffs of Ballypallidy\r\nrather suggests the actual discharge of rhyolitic ashes during the same\r\nperiod. But it would appear that the superficial outbursts of rhyolitic\r\nmaterial, whether in the form of lava or of tuff, were only of trifling\r\nextent, or else that the interval between the eruption of the two\r\nbasalt-groups was so prolonged that any such superficial material was\r\nthen removed by denudation. The varieties of lithological character to\r\nbe met with among the acid protrusions of Antrim suggests a succession\r\nof uprises of rhyolites differing from each other more or less in\r\ncomposition and structure. Unfortunately the ground is generally so\r\ncovered with superficial accumulations, and the exposures of rock are\r\nso poor and limited, that no sequence has yet been determined among the\r\nseveral kinds of acid rock. The only locality where I have observed\r\nclear evidence of such a sequence is on the old quarries half a mile\r\nwest of Shankerburn Bridge, and three miles north-west of Dromore,\r\nCounty Down. A small boss of rhyolite there rises through the Silurian\r\nstrata. It consists partly of a coarse-grained lithoidal rhyolite, with\r\nlarge smoky quartzes and felspars, and partly of a much finer textured\r\nvariety. The latter, on the south side of the small brook which\r\nseparates the quarries, can be seen to ascend vertically through the\r\ncoarse-grained rock into which it sends a projecting vein. Its margin\r\nshows a streaky flow-structure parallel with its vertical wall and is\r\nin places spherulitic. Here the closer-grained rock is certainly later\r\nthan the rest of the mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\n                    THE ACID SILLS, DYKES AND VEINS\r\n\r\n\r\n                             i. THE SILLS\r\n\r\nNot only have the acid rocks been protruded in small and large bosses,\r\nthey have also been injected as sills between the bedding-planes of\r\nstratified rocks, between the surfaces of the basalt-beds, and between\r\nthe bottom of the plateau-basalts or of the gabbros and the platform\r\nof older rock on which the volcanic series has been piled up. Every\r\ngradation of size may be observed, from mere partings not more than\r\nan inch or two in thickness, up to massive sheets, which now, owing\r\nto the removal of their original covering of rock by denudation, form\r\nminor groups and ranges of hills. Where the sheets are numerous, they\r\nare usually small in size; where, on the other hand, they are few in\r\nnumber, they reach their greatest dimensions.\r\n\r\nIt is not always possible to discriminate between bosses and large\r\nirregular sills. A good illustration of the connection between these\r\ntwo forms of intrusion will be cited from the island of Raasay, where a\r\nwidespread intrusive sheet is in part connected with a true boss.\r\n\r\nIn Mull, sills of acid eruptive rocks are profusely abundant throughout\r\nthe central mountainous tract between Loch na Keal and Loch Spelve. If\r\nwe ascend the slopes from the Sound of Mull, for instance, we have not\r\ngone far before some of these sheets make their appearance. They are\r\nusually dull granular quartz-porphyries, or granophyres, often only two\r\nor three feet in thickness, and interposed between the beds of basalt\r\nthat form the mass of the hills. Along the crest of the ridge that\r\nstretches through Beinn Chreagach Mhor to Mainnir nam Fiadh they take\r\na prominent place among the ledges of basalt, basalt-conglomerate and\r\ndolerite. The largest sheet in Mull is probably that which has thrust\r\nitself between the base of the basalts and the underlying Jurassic\r\nstrata and crystalline-schists on the shore of the Sound of Mull at\r\nCraignure. The porphyry of this sheet is referred to by Professor\r\nZirkel as only a finer-grained variety of the same quartziferous rock,\r\nwith hornblende and orthoclase crystals, which in Skye breaks through\r\nthe Lias.[430] On the south coast also, at the base of the thick basalt\r\nseries, similar porphyries have been injected into the underlying\r\nstrata; and under the great gabbro mass of Ben Buy similar protrusions\r\noccur. But as we retire from the mountainous tract into the undisturbed\r\nbasalts of the plateau, these acid intercalations gradually disappear.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 430: _Zeitsch. Deutsch. Geol. Gesellsch._ xxiii. p. 54.]\r\n\r\nIn the islands of Eigg and Rum, excellent examples occur of the\r\ntendency which the sheets of porphyry or granophyre manifest to appear\r\nat or about the base of the bedded basalts. I have already alluded to\r\nthe boss or sheet at the north end of the former island. A still more\r\nstriking illustration occurs in Rum. All along the base of the great\r\nmass of gabbro, protrusions of various kinds of acid rock have taken\r\nplace. The great mass of Orval, already described, is one of these.\r\nBelow Barkeval and round the foot of the hills to the south-east of\r\nthat eminence an interrupted band of quartz-porphyry may be traced,\r\nfrom which veins proceed into the gabbros and dolerites.\r\n\r\nBut it is in Skye and Raasay that the intrusive sheets of the acid\r\ngroup of rocks reach their chief development. They have been most\r\nabundantly injected underneath the bedded basalts, particularly among\r\nthe Jurassic strata. A band or belt of them, though not continuous,\r\ncan be traced round the east side of the main body of granophyre, at\r\na distance of from a mile and a half to about three miles. Beginning\r\nnear the point of Suisnish, this belt curves through the hilly ground\r\nfor some five miles, until it dies out on the slopes above Skulamus.\r\nIt may be found again on the west side of the ridge of Beinn Suardal,\r\nand on the moors above Corry, till it reaches the shore at the Rudh'\r\nan Eireannich (Irishman's Point). It skirts the west side of Scalpa\r\nIsland, and runs for some miles through Raasay. Another series of sills\r\noccurs below the basalts and gabbros in the Blaven group of hills.\r\n\r\nOver a large part of their course, the rocks of the eastern belt rest\r\nin great overlying sheets upon the Jurassic strata, which may almost\r\neverywhere be seen dipping under them. From the analogy of other\r\ndistricts, we may, I think, infer that the position of these sills here\r\npoints to their having been intruded at the base of the plateau-basalts\r\nwhich have since been removed from almost the whole tract. Fortunately,\r\na portion of the basalts remains in Raasay, and enables us to connect\r\nthat island with the great plateau of Skye of which it once formed a\r\npart. There can be no doubt that the basalts of the Dùn Caan ridge once\r\nextended westwards across the tract of granophyre which now forms most\r\nof the surface between that ridge and the Sound of Raasay. A thin sheet\r\nof quartz-porphyry, interposed among the Oolitic strata, may be seen\r\na little inland from the top of the great eastern cliff and below the\r\nposition of the bedded basalts.\r\n\r\nThe great sheet, or rather series of sheets, which stretches\r\nnorth-eastwards from Suisnish at the mouth of Loch Eishort in\r\nSkye, consists of a rock which for the most part may readily be\r\ndistinguished in the field from the granitoid material of the\r\nbosses. It appears to the naked eye to be a rather close-grained or\r\nfinely crystalline-granular quartz-porphyry, with scattered blebs\r\nor bi-pyramidal crystals of quartz and crystals of orthoclase. At\r\nthe contact with adjacent rocks, the texture becomes more felsitic,\r\nsometimes distinctly spherulitic (west side of Carn Nathragh, next\r\nLias shale). Under the microscope the rock is seen to be a fine-grained\r\ngranophyric porphyry or porphyritic granophyre. It caps Carn Dearg (636\r\nfeet) above Suisnish, where it covers a space of nearly a square mile,\r\nand reaches at its eastern extremity (Beinn Bhuidhe), a height of 908\r\nfeet above the sea (Fig. 249). This rock rests upon a sill of dolerite,\r\nand is apparently split up by it. But, as I have already stated, the\r\nbasic rock is probably the older of the two, and the granophyre seems\r\nto have wedged itself between two earlier doleritic sheets. To the\r\nnorth-west of Carn Dearg, above the northern end of the crofts of\r\nSuisnish, the same sill, or one occupying a similar position, crops out\r\nbetween masses of granophyre, and is intersected by narrow veins from\r\nthat rock.\r\n\r\nThough severed by denudation, the large sheets of granophyre to the\r\neast of Beinn Bhuidhe are no doubt continuations of the Carn Dearg\r\nmass, or at least occupy a similar position. That they are completely\r\nunconformable to the Jurassic strata is shown by the fact, that while\r\nat Suisnish they lie on sandstones which must be fully 1000 feet above\r\nthe bottom of the Lias, only two miles to the east they are found\r\nresting on the very basement limestones, within a few yards from the\r\nunderlying quartzite and Torridon sandstone. I do not think that this\r\ntransgression can be accounted for by intrusion obliquely across the\r\nstratification. I regard it as arising from the eruptive rock having\r\nforced its way between the bottom of the now vanished basalt-plateau\r\nand the denuded surface of Jurassic rocks, over which the basalts were\r\npoured. The platform underneath these granophyre sills thus represents,\r\nin my opinion, the terrestrial surface before the beginning of the\r\nvolcanic period.\r\n\r\nBut there is abundant proof that though the intruded granophyre sills\r\nfollowed generally this plane of separation, they did not rigidly\r\nadhere to it, but burrowed, as it were, along lower horizons. Thus\r\non the south-east front of Beinn a' Chàirn, which forms so fine an\r\nescarpment above the valley of Heast, the base of the granophyre,\r\nafter creeping upward across successive beds of limestone, sends out\r\na narrow tongue into these strata, and continues its course a little\r\nhigher up in the Lias. The same rock, after spreading out into the\r\nbroad flat tableland of Beinn a' Chàirn (983 feet), rapidly contracts\r\nnorth-eastwards into a narrow strip which forms the crest of the ridge,\r\nand at once suggests a much-weathered lava-stream. The resemblance\r\nto a _coulée_ is heightened by the curious thinning off of the rocks\r\nwhere the two streams emerge from the Heast lochs; it looks as if the\r\nigneous mass were a mere superficial ridge which had been cut down by\r\nerosion, so as to expose the shales beneath it. But that the granophyre\r\nis really a sill becomes abundantly clear at its eastern end, where we\r\nfind that it consists of two separate sheets with intervening Liassic\r\nshales. The structure of this interesting locality is shown in Fig.\r\n372. In this instance also, there is evidence that the acid sills are\r\nyounger than the basic, for the upper sheet of granophyre sends up\r\ninto the overlying dark basaltic rock narrow vertical felsitic veins,\r\na quarter of an inch to an inch in width, which being more durable,\r\nstand out above the decomposable surface of the containing rock, and\r\nshow their quartz-blebs and felspar crystals on the weathered surface.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking feature of the granophyre sills of Skye is\r\ntheir general association with thinner basic intrusive sheets between\r\nwhich they have insinuated themselves. This characteristic structure,\r\npointed out by me in 1888, has recently been more minutely mapped\r\nin the progress of the Geological Survey. Mr. Harker has found the\r\ntypical arrangement to be the occurrence of a thick sill of granophyre\r\ninterposed between two sills of basalt, each of which is usually not\r\nmore than six or eight feet thick. Where the granophyre has been\r\nintruded independently among the Lias formations, it does not assume\r\nthe regularity and persistence which mark it where it has followed the\r\ncourse of basic sills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 372.--Section across the Granophyre Sills at Loch\r\na' Mhullaich, above Skulamus, Skye.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Jurassic sandstones and shales; _b_, Jurassic dark brown\r\n  sandy shales; _c_, sills of basalt, some bands highly cellular;\r\n  _c´_, basalt-sill with veins of felsite rising into it from the\r\n  granophyre below; _d_ _d_, intrusive sheets or sills of granophyre.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\"The acid rock,\" Mr. Harker observes, \"is invariably the later\r\nintrusion, for it sends narrow veins into the basalts, metamorphosing\r\nthem to some extent and frequently enclosing fragments of them. These\r\nfragments are always rounded by corrosion, and show various stages\r\nof dissolution down to mere darker patches as seen by the naked\r\neye. Such inclusions and patches are found in the marginal part of\r\na granophyre, where no continuous basalt occurs, but where the acid\r\nmagma has evidently in places completely destroyed the earlier basic\r\nsheets between which it was forced. It seems probable that in all cases\r\na certain amount of solution of the basalt by the granophyre magma\r\ntook place at their contact, facilitating the injection of the later\r\nintrusion and accounting for its persistent choice of the contact-plane\r\nof two basalt-sills as the surface offering least resistance to its\r\ninjection.\"\r\n\r\nThese observations throw fresh light on the remarkable original\r\nregularity and persistence of the basic sills. Where one of these\r\nsills disappears above or below a granophyre sheet its probable former\r\npresence is often indicated by corroded fragments of the basic in the\r\nacid rock. Mr. Harker remarks that the acid magma seems to have been\r\n\"in itself less adapted than the basic to follow accurately a definite\r\nhorizon and to maintain a uniform thickness in its intruded sheets, but\r\ncould do both when guided by a pre-existing basalt-sill, or especially\r\nwhen insinuated between contiguous basalt-sills.\" The corrosive action\r\nof the acid magma on the surface of the basalt, which enabled it to\r\nforce its way more readily between the basic sills, might proceed so\r\nfar as partially or wholly to destroy these sills.\r\n\r\nThis solvent action may serve to explain some of the irregularities\r\nof the granophyre intrusions. According to the same observer, such\r\nirregularities are found \"where the granophyre sheet and its encasing\r\nbasalt-sills are not co-extensive, or again where the two basalt-sills\r\nseparate, owing to one of them cutting obliquely across the bedding.\r\nIn the latter case, which is not common, the granophyre follows one of\r\nthe basalt-sills, necessarily parting from the other. When one of the\r\ntwo guiding basalt-sills dies out, the granophyre may still continue,\r\nfollowing the sill which persists. If the latter also dies out, while\r\nthe granophyre is still in some force, the acid magma seems to have\r\nbeen reluctant to travel beyond the limit of the basalt, but has drawn\r\ntowards it, and the granophyre presents a blunt laccolitic form, which\r\ncontrasts with the acutely tapering edge of a granophyre which dies out\r\nbefore reaching the limit of its basalt-sills. If, on the other hand,\r\non reaching the limit of the basalt, the acid magma has been in such\r\nforce as to be driven further, it is usually found to lose something\r\nof its regularity and to depart from the exact horizon which it has\r\nhitherto followed. This seems to happen, for instance, in the Beinn\r\na' Chàirn sheet, which, when traced westward, is found to behave as a\r\n'boss' and is obviously transgressive, having cut across the bedding of\r\nthe strata so as to enter the limestones, where it no longer behaves\r\nin any degree as a sill. The district affords many examples of the\r\ntendency of intrusive masses in general to cut sharply across the beds\r\nwhen they enter a group of limestones.\"\r\n\r\nMore complex examples of acid sills are to be found where there have\r\nbeen three or more basic sheets together. The great granophyre sheet\r\nalready referred to at Suisnish affords the best illustration of this\r\nstructure. Mr. Harker has noticed that \"round most of its circumference\r\nthere is seen merely a single basalt-sill passing under the granophyre.\r\nProbably there has been another similar sheet over the acid rock, but\r\nif so, it has been removed by erosion, the granophyre itself forming\r\neverywhere the surface of the plateau. On the southern side, however,\r\nwe see that the original basalt must have been at least triple, or\r\ncounting the uppermost member, now removed, quadruple. The granophyre\r\nhas forced its way in between the several members of the multiple\r\nbasalt-sill, the intermediate ones being thus completely enveloped.\r\nThey are evidently metamorphosed as well as veined by the granophyre,\r\nand when traced onward they give place to detached portions which,\r\nfloating as it were in the acid rock, are soon lost.\"\r\n\r\nIt is seldom easy to determine where lay the vent or vents from which\r\nthe granophyre sills proceeded. Those of the Skye platform just\r\ndescribed may be chiefly concealed under some of the larger areas of\r\nthe rock, such as the sheets of Carn Dearg or Beinn a' Chàirn. But\r\nin several places, in close association with the compound sills of\r\ngranophyre and basalt, Mr. Harker has found large dyke-like bodies of\r\nthe acid rock, which may with considerable probability be regarded\r\nas marking the position of the channels by which the material of the\r\nsills ascended. \"These bodies,\" he remarks, \"either occur isolated by\r\nerosion, the sills or the parts of the sills presumed to have been\r\nin connection with the dykes having been removed, or are only very\r\npartially exhibited in direct connection with sills still remaining.\r\nWhere they can be examined in detail they are seen to be dykes varying\r\nup to about 100 feet in width, but of no great longitudinal extent.\r\nBetween Suisnish and Cnoc Carnach they bear E.N.E., that is, at right\r\nangles to the ordinary basic dykes of the district and parallel to the\r\ngeneral direction of the axes of folding, though further north they\r\nchange this trend, but still remain parallel to the strike of the Lias.\r\n\r\n\"These dykes are composed essentially of granophyre, identical with\r\nthat of the sills. In some cases, they are flanked with basalt-dykes\r\non one or both sides, or the former existence of such lateral dykes\r\nis indicated by partly-destroyed inclusions of the basic rock in the\r\ngranophyre. The basalt found in these cases is identical with that\r\nof the basic sills, and shows the same relation to the granophyre.\r\nDiscontinuity and failure of the basalt are commoner, however, in the\r\ndykes than in the sills--a difference presumably attributable to more\r\nenergetic destructive action of the acid magma when it was hotter and\r\nfresher. These supposed feeders of the granophyre sills are certainly\r\nin some cases, and have possibly been in all, double or triple dykes.\r\nThe acid magma thus appears not only to have spread laterally along the\r\nsame platforms as the earlier basalts, but to have reached these levels\r\nby rising through the same fissures which had already given passage to\r\nthe basic magma.\"[431]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 431: MS. notes supplied by Mr. Harker.]\r\n\r\nThe granophyre sills which, as already stated, can be followed as an\r\ninterrupted band from Suisnish Point to the Sound of Scalpa, emerge\r\nagain beyond Loch Sligachan and also in the island of Raasay, where\r\na great sheet of the acid rock covers an area of about five square\r\nmiles. This tract has recently been mapped for the Geological Survey by\r\nMr. H. B. Woodward, who has found it to have been intruded across the\r\nJurassic series, a large part of its mass coming in irregularly about\r\nthe top of the thick white sandstones of the Inferior Oolite. But it\r\ndescends beneath the Secondary rocks altogether, and in some places\r\nintervenes between the base of the Infra-liassic conglomerates and the\r\nTorridon sandstone. Its irregular course transgressively across the\r\nMesozoic formations is probably to be regarded as another example of\r\nthe intrusion of the acid material preferentially along the line of\r\nunconformability between the older rocks and the Tertiary basalts, now\r\nnearly all removed from Raasay by denudation, though the intrusion does\r\nnot rigidly follow that line of division, but sometimes descends below\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe central portions of this Raasay granophyre possess the ordinary\r\nstructures of the corresponding rocks in Skye. They show a finely\r\ncrystalline-granular, micropegmatitic base, through which large\r\nfelspars and quartzes are dispersed. But at the upper and under\r\njunction with the sedimentary rocks, beautiful spherulitic structures\r\nare developed. This is well seen on the shore near the Point of\r\nSuisnish (Raasay), where, below the Lias Limestones, the top of the\r\ngranophyre appears, and where its bottom is seen to lie on the Torridon\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\nThis granophyre sheet presents a further point of interest inasmuch as\r\nit appears to have preserved one of the dyke-like masses which may mark\r\nchannels of escape from the general body of the acid magma below. Near\r\nthe Manse the section represented in Fig. 373 may be observed. Owing\r\nto great denudation, the massive sheet of granophyre has been cut into\r\nisolated outliers which cap the low hills, and the rock may be seen\r\ndescending through the Jurassic sandstones, which in places are much\r\nindurated. It is observable that the amount of contact-metamorphism\r\ninduced by the granophyre sills upon the rocks between which they have\r\nbeen injected is, in general, comparatively trifling. It is for the\r\nmost part a mere induration, sometimes accompanied with distortion and\r\nfracture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 373.--Section to show the connection of a sill of\r\nGranophyre with its probable funnel of supply, Raasay.\r\n\r\n_a_ _a_, Jurassic sandstones; _b_, granophyre.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 374.--Granophyre sill resting on Lower Lias shales\r\nwith a dyke of basalt passing laterally into a sill, Suisnish Point,\r\nIsle of Raasay.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the intrusion of the granophyre sills has been subsequent to\r\nthat of the basalt-sheets with which they are so generally associated,\r\nwe may expect that as there is a series of post-granophyre basic dykes,\r\nso there may be some basic sills later than the injections of the acid\r\nsheets. The Raasay granophyre appears to furnish an example of such a\r\nlater basic intrusion. At the Point of Suisnish on that island I have\r\nobserved the relations shown in Fig. 374. There the dark shales of the\r\nLower Lias (_a_ _a_) are immediately overlain by the granophyre sill\r\n(_b_), and are cut by a basalt-dyke which, when it rises to the base\r\nof the granophyre, turns abruptly to one side, and then pursues its\r\ncourse as a sill (_c_) between the granophyre and the shales. There can\r\nbe little doubt that this intrusion is later than the granophyre. Here\r\na basic sill is interposed at the bottom of the acid sheet; and is\r\nvisibly connected with the actual fissure up which its molten material\r\nwas impelled.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. THE ACID DYKES AND VEINS\r\n\r\nBesides bosses and sills, the acid rocks of the Inner Hebrides take the\r\nform of Dykes and Veins which have invaded the other members of the\r\nvolcanic series. Some of these have already been referred to; but a\r\nmore particular description of the venous development of the acid rocks\r\nas a whole is now required.\r\n\r\nAs regards their occurrence and distribution, they present two phases,\r\nwhich, however, cannot always be distinguished from each other. On the\r\none hand, they are found abundantly either directly proceeding from the\r\nbosses (more rarely from the sills), or in such immediate proximity\r\nand close relationship to these as to indicate that they must be\r\nregarded as apophyses from the larger bodies of eruptive material. On\r\nthe other hand, they present themselves as solitary individuals, or in\r\ngroups at a distance of sometimes several miles from any visible boss\r\nof granophyre. In such cases, it is of course obvious that though not\r\nexposed at the surface, there may be a large mass of the acid magma at\r\nno great distance beneath, and that these isolated dykes and veins do\r\nnot essentially differ in origin from those of which the relations to\r\neruptive bosses can be satisfactorily observed or inferred.\r\n\r\nConsidered as a petrographical group, these Dykes and Veins are marked\r\nby the following characters. At the one extreme, we have thoroughly\r\nvitreous rocks in the pitchstones. From these, through various degrees\r\nof devitrification, we are led to completely lithoid felsites,\r\nquartz-porphyries or rhyolites. Micropegmatitic structure is commonly\r\npresent, and as it increases in development, the rocks assume the\r\nordinary characters of granophyre. Occasionally the structure becomes\r\nmicrogranitic in the immediate periphery of a boss wherein a granitic\r\ncharacter has been assumed. Viewed as a whole, however, it may be said\r\nthat the dull lithoid rocks of the dykes and veins can generally be\r\nresolved under the microscope into some variety of granophyric porphyry\r\nor granophyre.\r\n\r\nA characteristic feature in the granophyric, felsitic or rhyolitic\r\ndykes and veins is the presence of spherulitic structure (Figs. 375,\r\n377). In some cases this structure is hardly traceable save with\r\nthe aid of the microscope, but from these minute proportions it may\r\nbe followed up to such a strong development that the individual\r\nspherulites may be an inch or two in diameter, and lie crowded\r\ntogether, like the round pebbles of a conglomerate. The structure is\r\na contact phenomenon, being specially marked along the margin of the\r\ndykes, as it is on the edge of sills and bosses. In the Strath district\r\nof Skye, Mr. Clough and Mr. Harker have observed that the spherulites\r\nare apt to be grouped in parallel lines so as to form rod-like\r\naggregates along the walls, and that where the rock is fairly fresh the\r\ncentre of the dyke sometimes consists of glassy pitchstone, so that the\r\nspherulitic felsite or granophyre is probably devitrified pitchstone.\r\nFrequently flow-structure is admirably developed in these dykes, the\r\nstreaky layers of devitrification flowing round the spherulites and any\r\nenclosed fragments as perfectly as in any rhyolitic lava (Fig. 378).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 375.--Weathered surface of spherulitic granophyre\r\nfrom dyke in banded gabbros, Druim an Eidhne, Meall Dearg, Glen\r\nSligachan, Skye. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nIn regard to their modes of occurrence, the dykes of acid material\r\ndiffer in some important respects from those of basic composition. More\r\nespecially they are apt to assume the irregular venous form, rather\r\nthan the vertical wall-like character of ordinary dykes. They take\r\nthe form of dykes, particularly where their material has been guided\r\nin its uprise by one or more already existent basic or intermediate\r\ndykes, as in the compound dykes, already described. The conditions for\r\ntheir production must thus have been essentially different from those\r\nof the great body of the basic dykes. Their intrusion was not marked\r\nby any general and widespread fissuring of the earth's crust, such as\r\nprepared rents for the reception of the basalt and andesite dykes.\r\nThey were rather accompaniments of the protrusion of large masses of\r\nacid magma into the terrestrial crust. This magma, as we have seen,\r\nwas often markedly liquid, and was impelled, sometimes with what\r\nmight be called explosive violence, into the irregular cracks of the\r\nshattered surrounding rocks or into pre-existing dyke-fissures. Hence\r\nlong straight dykes of the acid rocks are much less common than short\r\nirregular tortuous veins and strings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 376.--Plan of portion of the ridge north of Druim an Eidhne,\r\n  Glen Sligachan, Skye, showing three dykes issuing from a mass of\r\n  granophyre.\r\n\r\n  _a_, gabbros; _b_, granophyre; I. II. III., three dykes proceeding\r\n  from the granophyre. The arrows show the direction of dip of the\r\n  bands of gabbro.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMuch difference may be noticed among the granophyre bosses in regard to\r\ntheir giving off a fringe of apophyses. Thus, along the well-exposed\r\nboundary of Beinn-an-Dubhaich in Skye, though the edge of the boss is\r\nremarkably notched, hardly any veins deserving the name diverge from\r\nit. On the other hand, the ridge of Meall Dearg at the head of Glen\r\nSligachan, already referred to, is distinguished by the number and\r\nvariety of the dykes and veins which proceed from the granophyre and\r\ntraverse the banded gabbros. As this locality has been elsewhere fully\r\ndescribed, I will give here only the leading structural features which\r\nit presents.[432]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 432: Professor Judd (_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. xlix.\r\n(1893), p. 175) described the granophyre dykes of this locality as\r\ninclusions of Tertiary granite in the gabbro, and cited them in proof\r\nof his contention that the acid eruptions of the Western Isles are\r\nolder than the basic. Their true character was shown by me in a paper\r\npublished in the _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. 1. (1894), p. 212.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 377.--Weathered surface of spherulitic granophyre\r\nfrom dyke in banded gabbros, Druim an Eidhne, Meall Dearg, Glen\r\nSligachan, Skye. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nWithin a horizontal distance of less than 100 yards three well-marked\r\ndykes issue from the spherulitic edge of the Meall Dearg granophyre,\r\nand run in a south-easterly direction in the handed gabbros (Fig. 376).\r\nThe most northerly of these is traceable in a nearly straight line for\r\n800 feet. The central dyke, which can be followed for 200 feet or more,\r\nrises as a band six to ten feet broad between the dark walls of gabbro\r\nas represented in Fig. 379.\r\n\r\nThese dykes are marked by the most perfectly developed spherulitic\r\nand flow-structures (Figs. 375, 377). Numerous detached portions of\r\nother dykes and also irregular veins are to be observed cutting the\r\nbanded gabbros all over the ridge of Druim an Eidhne for a distance of\r\na mile or more. Many of these exhibit the same exquisitely beautiful\r\nspherulitic and flow-structure displayed by the dykes which can\r\nactually be traced into the main body of granophyre. The lines of\r\nflow conform to every sinuosity in the boundary-walls of gabbro, and\r\nsometimes sweep round and enclose blocks of that rock. The example\r\nof this structure, given in Fig. 378, shows how these lines, curving\r\nround projections and bending into eddy-like swirls, exhibit the\r\nmotion of a viscous lava flowing in a cleft between two walls of solid\r\nrock. Sometimes the laminæ of flow have been disrupted, and broken\r\nportions of them have been carried onward and enveloped in the yet\r\nunconsolidated material. Certain portions of this dyke are richly\r\nspherulitic, the spherulites varying from the size of small peas up to\r\nthat of tennis-balls. Occasionally two large spherulites have coalesced\r\ninto an 8-shaped concretion, and it may be observed in some cases that\r\nthe spherulites are hollow shells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 378.--Plan of pale granophyric dyke, with\r\nspherulitic and flow-structure, cutting and enclosing dark gabbro,\r\nDruim an Eidhne.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 379.--Dyke (six to ten feet broad) proceeding\r\nfrom a large body of granophyre and traversing gabbro, from the same\r\nlocality as Figs. 375 and 377.]\r\n\r\nA remarkable feature has been recently observed by Mr. Harker among the\r\nabundant granophyre dykes and veins which intersect the gabbros and\r\nolder rocks, along the eastern flanks of the Red Hills of Skye between\r\nBroadford and the Sound of Scalpa. Broad dykes of granophyre which\r\ntraverse the Cambrian limestone of that district might be supposed\r\nat first sight to be cut off by the intrusions of gabbro. But closer\r\nexamination proves that their apparent truncation arises from their\r\nsuddenly breaking up into a network of small veins where they abut\r\nagainst the basic rock. This structure evidently belongs to the same\r\ntype as that of the St. Kilda granophyre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 380.--Section of intruded veins of various acid\r\nrocks above River Clachaig, Mull.\r\n\r\n_a_ _a_, basalt, dolerite, etc.; _b_ _b_, granophyre.]\r\n\r\nCompound dykes and sills, where one or more of the injections has\r\nconsisted of acid material, have been already noticed as intimately\r\nassociated together in Skye (p. 162). Dykes of this nature are more\r\nparticularly abundant in Strath, especially along its eastern side. In\r\naddition to the examples cited already from that district, I may refer\r\nto other two which intersect the Middle Lias shales and limestones\r\nin the island of Scalpa. They are both compound dykes, but the more\r\nbasic marginal bands are not always continuous, having possibly been\r\nhere and there dissolved by the acid invasion. Though they do not show\r\nany distinct spherulitic forms, the presence of flow-structure is\r\nindicated by the thin slabs into which the rocks weather parallel to\r\nthe dyke-walls. The rock in each case is a fine-grained felsitic mass,\r\nwith bi-pyramidal crystals of quartz. It is observable that where these\r\ndykes come directly against the Liassic strata, the latter are more\r\nseriously indurated than where they are traversed by the ordinary basic\r\ndykes.\r\n\r\nIn the central mountainous tract of the island of Mull veins of\r\nacid material are extraordinarily abundant. They probably proceed\r\nfrom a much larger subterranean body of granophyre than any of the\r\ncomparatively small bosses of this rock which appear at the present\r\nsurface of the ground. They show themselves partly at the margins of\r\nthe visible bosses, but much more profusely in that tract of altered\r\nbasalt, with intrusive sheets and dykes of basalt, dolerite and gabbro,\r\nwhich lies within the great ring of heights between Loch na Keal and\r\nLoch Spelve. In some areas, the amount of injected material appears to\r\nequal the mass of more basic rock into which it has been thrust. Pale\r\ngrey and yellowish porphyries and granophyres, varying from thick dykes\r\ndown to the merest threads, ramify in an intricate network through the\r\ndark rocks of the hills, as shown in the accompanying illustration\r\n(Fig. 380), which represents a portion of the hillside between Beinn\r\nFhada and the Clachaig River. Such a profusion of veins probably\r\nindicates the existence here of some large mass of granophyre or\r\ngranite, at no great depth beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nIn Mull, as in the other islands of the Inner Hebrides, two horizons\r\non which protrusions of acid materials have been specially abundant,\r\nare the base of the bedded basalts of the plateau and the bottom of the\r\nthick sheets of gabbro. Dykes and veins of granophyre, quartz-porphyry,\r\nfelsite and other allied rocks are sometimes crowded together along\r\nthese two horizons, though they may be infrequent above or below them.\r\n\r\nIllustrations of solitary veins in the midst of unaltered\r\nplateau-basalts or in older rocks may be gathered from many parts of\r\nthe Western Isles. Some remarkable instances are to be seen among\r\nthe basalts that form the terraced slopes on the north side of Loch\r\nSligachan. Several thick dykes of granophyre run up the declivity,\r\ncutting across hundreds of feet of the nearly level basalt-beds. Some\r\nof them can be seen on the shore passing under the sea. They trend in a\r\nS.S.E. direction towards Glamaig, and they are not improbably apophyses\r\nfrom that huge boss, the nearest edge of which is three-quarters of\r\na mile distant. Another example may be cited from the basalt-outlier\r\nof Strathaird, where two veins of felsite, one of them a pale flinty\r\nrock showing flow-structure parallel to the walls, may be seen on the\r\nwest front of Ben Meabost. In this case, the veins are three miles and\r\na half from the granophyre mass of Strath na Creitheach to the north,\r\nfour miles from that of Beinn an Dubhaich to the north-east, and nearly\r\nthree miles from that of Coire Uaigneich at the foot of Blath Bheinn.\r\n\r\nA special place must be reserved for the pitchstone-veins. Ever\r\nsince the early explorations of Jameson and Macculloch, the West of\r\nScotland has been noted as one of the chief European districts for\r\nthese vitreous rocks. From Skye to Arran, and thence to Antrim, many\r\nlocalities have furnished examples of them, but always within the\r\nlimits of the Tertiary volcanic region. That all of the pitchstones\r\nare of Tertiary age cannot, of course, be proved, for some of them are\r\nfound traversing only Palæozoic rocks, and of these all that can be\r\nabsolutely affirmed is that they must be younger than the Carboniferous\r\nor even the Permian system. But, as most of them are unquestionably\r\nparts of the Tertiary volcanic series, they are probably all referable\r\nto that series. Not only so, but there is, I think, good reason to\r\nplace them among its very youngest members. It is a significant fact\r\nthat they almost always occur either in or close to granophyre or\r\ngranite bosses, the comparatively late origin of which has now been\r\nproved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 381.--Pitchstone vein traversing the bedded basalts, Rudh an\r\n  Tangairt, Eigg.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first pitchstone observed in Skye was found by Jameson on the\r\nflanks of the great granophyre cone of Glamaig. Another rises on the\r\nside of the porphyry mass of Glas Bheinn Bheag, in Strath Beg. Several\r\noccur at the foot of Beinn na Callich. In Rum, I found a pitchstone\r\nvein traversing the western slopes of the wide granophyre boss of\r\nOrval. In Eigg, the well-known veins of this rock intersect the\r\nplateau-basalts (Fig. 381), but they are accompanied, even within the\r\nsame fissure, with granophyre, and in their near neighbourhood lie the\r\nmasses of this rock already alluded to.[433] In Antrim, pitchstone and\r\nobsidian occur in the midst of the rhyolite. The only marked exceptions\r\nto the general rule, with which I am acquainted, are those of the\r\nisland of Arran. Most of the pitchstone-veins in that district traverse\r\nthe red sandstones which may be Permian. But none of them are far\r\nremoved from the great granite boss of the northern half of the island,\r\nwhile large masses of quartz-porphyry, which strikingly resemble some\r\nof those of Skye and Mull, lie still nearer to them. It is also worthy\r\nof notice that pitchstone-veins rise through the Arran granite boss\r\nitself, the probably Tertiary date of which has been already discussed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 433: For an account of the pitchstone veins of Eigg, see\r\n_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ xxvii. p. 299.]\r\n\r\nThis common association of pitchstone-veins with the Tertiary eruptive\r\nbosses of acid rocks can hardly be a mere accidental coincidence.\r\nIt seems to prove a renewed extravasation of acid material, now in\r\nvitreous form, from the same vents that had supplied the granitoid,\r\ngranophyric, porphyritic and felsitic varieties of earlier protrusions.\r\nWe must remember that the pitchstone-veins are not mere local glassy\r\nparts of the larger bodies of granophyre or granite in which they\r\nlie. Their margins are sharply defined; they are indeed in all\r\nrespects as manifestly intruded, and therefore later masses, as are\r\nthe basalt-dykes. Their occurrence, therefore, within the acid bosses\r\nproves them to be younger than these members of the Tertiary volcanic\r\nseries. Whether they are also later than the latest basalt-dykes cannot\r\nyet be decided, for I have never succeeded in finding an example of the\r\nintersection of these two groups of veins and dykes. But, with this\r\npossible exception, the pitchstones are the most recent of all the\r\neruptive rocks of Britain.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the intrusive pitchstones occur as veins which cannot be\r\ntraced far, and which vary from a few yards to less than an inch in\r\nwidth. They generally show considerable irregularity in breadth and\r\ndirection, sometimes sending out strings into the surrounding rock\r\n(Fig. 381). The outer portions are not infrequently more glassy and\r\nobsidian-like than the interior. Occasionally the vitreous character\r\ndisappears by devitrification, and the rock assumes the texture of a\r\ncompact felsite or of a spherulitic rock.\r\n\r\nAmong the later movements of the acid magma account must be taken here\r\nof the pale fine-grained veins which have already been referred to as\r\ntraversing the granophyre bosses. These intrusions, so well seen in\r\nthe bosses of Skye and St. Kilda, are often so close in texture that\r\nthey may be called quartz-felsites. Their sharply-defined edges and\r\nfelsitic character suffice to separate them from what are termed \"veins\r\nof segregation.\" In at least one instance, that of Meall Dearg, already\r\ncited, a mass of typical granophyre which has developed spherulitic\r\nand flow-structures along its margin, and which sends out dykes having\r\nthe very same structures for a distance of several hundred feet across\r\nthe banded gabbros, is itself traversed by a dyke of precisely similar\r\ncharacter. Here we see that after the intrusion of its apophyses,\r\nand after its own consolidation in the upper parts, the granophyric\r\nmagma that rose into rents in the solidified portion retained the same\r\ntendency to produce large spherulites as it had shown at first.\r\n\r\nThe fine felsitic veins that traverse the granophyre of the Red\r\nHills are now being mapped by Mr. Harker during the progress of the\r\nGeological Survey. He has not yet obtained evidence of the age of these\r\nveins in relation to the latest basic dykes. He has observed that they\r\nappear to be on the whole rather less acid than the material of the\r\nsurrounding bosses, though they were probably all connected with the\r\nsame underlying acid magma from which the bosses were protruded. A\r\nsomewhat similar relation has been noticed between older granites and\r\ntheir surrounding dykes, as in Cornwall and Galloway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TO ACCOMPANY SIR ARCHIBALD GEIKIE'S \"ANCIENT VOLCANOES\r\nOF BRITAIN\"\r\n\r\nMap VII MAP OF THE TERTIARY VOLCANIC DISTRICT OF NORTH EAST IRELAND\r\n\r\nThe Edinburgh Geographical Institute Copyright J.

SUBSIDENCES\r\n\r\nThe mere fact that in many places the lower members of the series of\r\nterrestrial lavas have been submerged under the sea may be taken to\r\nprove a subsidence since older Tertiary time. Along the west coast of\r\nSkye this depression is well shown by the almost entire concealment\r\nof the bottom of the plateau under the Atlantic. In the Faroe Isles\r\nthe subsidence has advanced still further, for not a trace of the\r\nunderlying platform on which the basalts rest remains above water. In\r\nIceland, too, the complete submergence of the base of the Tertiary\r\nvolcanic sheets points to a widespread subsidence of that region.\r\n\r\nAnother strong argument in favour of considerable depression may be\r\nderived from a comparison of the submarine topography with that of the\r\ntracts above sea-level. It is obvious that the same forms of contour\r\nwhich are conspicuous on the land are prolonged under the Atlantic.\r\nIf we are correct in regarding the valleys as great lines of subærial\r\nerosion, their prolongations as fjords and submarine troughs must be\r\nconsidered as having had a similar origin. We can thus carry down the\r\nsurface of erosion several hundred feet lower than the line along which\r\nit disappears under the waves.\r\n\r\nI know no locality where this kind of reasoning is so impressively\r\nenforced upon the mind as the west end of the Scuir of Eigg. The\r\nold river-bed and its pitchstone terminate abruptly at the top of\r\na great precipice. Assuredly they must once have continued much\r\nfurther westward, as well as the sheets of basalt that form the main\r\npart of the cliff. Yet the sea in front of this truncated face of\r\nrock rapidly deepens to fully 500 feet in some places. Had any such\r\nhollow existed in the volcanic period it would have been filled up\r\nby the long-continued outflowings of basalt. Making every allowance\r\nfor concealed faults and local subsidences, we can only account for\r\nthis submarine topography by regarding it as having been carved out,\r\ntogether with the topography of the land, at a time when the level of\r\nthe latter was at least 500 feet higher than it is now.\r\n\r\nThe subsidence which is thus indicated along the whole of the\r\nNorth-West of Europe probably varied in amount from one region to\r\nanother. We seem to have traces of such inequalities in the varying\r\ninclinations of different segments of the basalt-plateaux. The angles\r\nof inclination are almost always gentle, but they differ so much in\r\ndirection from island to island, and even among the several districts\r\nof the same island, as to indicate that certain portions of the\r\nvolcanic plain have sunk rather more than other portions.\r\n\r\nThus in the Faroe Islands, where the bare cliffs allow the varying\r\nangles of inclination to be easily determined, a general gentle dip\r\nof the basalts in a south-easterly direction has been noted among the\r\ncentral and northern islands by previous observers. This inclination,\r\nhowever, is replaced among the southern islands by an equally gentle\r\ndip towards the north-east. The centre of depression would thus seem to\r\nlie somewhere about Sandö and Skuö. The highest angle of inclination\r\nwhich I noticed anywhere was at Myggenaes, where the basalts dip E.S.E.\r\nat about 15°.\r\n\r\nAmong the Western Isles, also, where similar variations in the\r\ninclination of the basalt-sheets are observable, it might be possible\r\nby careful survey to ascertain the probable position of the areas of\r\nmaximum depression, and to show to what extent differential movements\r\nhave affected the originally nearly level volcanic floor. It would\r\ndoubtless be found that everywhere the dominant movement has been one\r\nof subsidence. The vast outpourings of lava would tend to leave the\r\noverlying crust unsupported, and to cause it to sink into the cavities\r\nthus produced.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most extensive subsidence of this kind, at least that which\r\nadmits of most satisfactory investigation, because it still remains\r\nabove sea-level, is displayed by the vast hollow in the Antrim plateau,\r\nwhich embraces the basin of Lough Neagh and the valley of the Lower\r\nBann. This depression measures about 60 miles in length by about 20\r\nin breadth. Its axis follows the N.N.W. trend so characteristic of\r\nthe volcanic features of Tertiary time. The depression may be said to\r\ninvolve the entire basaltic plateau of Antrim, for with the exception\r\nof a few insignificant areas along the borders, especially on the east\r\nside between Larne and Cushendall, the whole region slopes inward from\r\nits marginal line of escarpments, which reach heights of 1800 feet and\r\nupwards, towards the great hollow in its centre (see Map VII.).\r\n\r\nLough Neagh, which occupies the deepest part of this hollow, and covers\r\nabout one-eighth of the whole area of subsidence, is the largest sheet\r\nof fresh water in the British Isles, for it exceeds 150 square miles in\r\nextent of surface. Yet, for its size, it is one of the shallowest of\r\nour lakes, its average depth being less than 40 feet. Its shallowness,\r\ncompared with its wide area, marks it out in strong contrast to most\r\nof the larger British lakes. Its surface is only 48 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe origin of Lough Neagh, the theme of various legends, has been\r\nseriously discussed by different writers, but most exhaustively by the\r\nlate E. T. Hardman of the Geological Survey.[434] This author connected\r\nthe formation of the lake-basin with a series of large faults which\r\nare found intersecting the rocks around the basin, and passing under\r\nthe water in a general north-easterly direction. He showed that these\r\nfaults have produced serious displacements of the strata, amounting\r\nsometimes to as much as 2000 feet, and he believed that it was by the\r\nconcurrent effect of such dislocations that the depression of Lough\r\nNeagh had been caused.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 434: \"On the Age and Formation of Lough Neagh,\" _Journ. Roy.\r\nGeol. Soc. Ireland_, vol. iv. (1875-76), p. 170; also Explanation of\r\nSheet 35 of the _Geol. Surv. Ireland_ (1877), p. 72.]\r\n\r\nIt is possible that these displacements may have contributed to at\r\nleast the earlier stages in the history of the Antrim subsidence. They\r\nhave undoubtedly taken place after the outpouring of the basalts, for\r\nthese rocks are involved in their effects. But in the hollow of the\r\nBann valley north of Lough Neagh the faults which have been detected\r\nin the basaltic plateau are few and trifling. The bold and bare\r\nescarpments, that so clearly display the relations of the rocks, reveal\r\nfew traces of any important transverse dislocations. Nor has any proof\r\nof large longitudinal faults parallel with the axis of depression been\r\nobtained within the area of the Bann valley.\r\n\r\nThe earliest evidence for the existence of a lake on the site of the\r\npresent Lough Neagh has been supposed to be furnished by certain fine\r\nclays, sands, seams of lignite and clay-ironstone, which have been\r\nreferred to the Pliocene period. These deposits have been regarded as\r\nindicating the accumulation of fine sediment with drift vegetation\r\nbrought down into a quiet lake by streams entering from the south.\r\nTheir fresh-water origin was believed to be further corroborated by the\r\noccurrence of shells belonging to the lacustrine or fluviatile genus,\r\n_Unio_.[435]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 435: These shells were regarded as forms of _Unio_ by the late\r\nW. H. Baily; but Dr. Henry Woodward assigned them to _Mytilus_. See\r\nProf. Hull's _Physical Geology and Geography of Ireland_, 2nd edit. p.\r\n101. The shells have been more recently dug out by Mr. Clement Reid,\r\nwho has found them to be the common _Mytilus edulis_.]\r\n\r\nThe thickness of this series of strata, their position above sea-level,\r\nand their distribution are important parts of the evidence for the\r\ngeological history of the locality. At one place the deposits are said\r\nto have been bored through to a depth of 294 feet, and Mr. Hardman\r\nbelieved them to be not less than 500 feet deep. The same observer\r\nfound that they certainly reach a height of 120 feet above the sea,\r\nand he was of opinion that in some places their height was not less\r\nthan 140 feet. The deposition of strata to the depth of 300 feet below\r\na level of 120 feet above the sea would, of course, entirely fill up\r\nLough Neagh, and spread over a large tract of low ground around it.\r\nThe pottery-clays and lignites, however, appear to be confined to the\r\nsouthern half of the lake, from which they rise gently into the low\r\ncountry around.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of these deposits and their extraordinary variations\r\nin altitude, as described by Mr. Hardman, present great difficulties\r\nin the attempt to regard them as the sediments of a Pliocene lake.\r\nA more recent examination of the ground by Mr. Clement Reid of the\r\nGeological Survey has led that able observer to believe that two\r\ntotally different groups of strata at Lough Neagh have been confounded.\r\nHe noticed the _Mytilus_-clay to be a dark blue mass full of derived\r\nboulder-clay stones, and yielding _Mytilus edulis_ and seeds of a\r\nsedge. This deposit cannot be Pliocene, but must be of Glacial or\r\npost-Glacial age, possibly contemporary with the Clyde beds. The\r\njunction of this clay with the pipe-clays is not at present seen,\r\nbut the lithological contrast between the two groups of strata is so\r\nstrong as to indicate their independence of each other. Mr. Reid found\r\nthe white, red and mottled pipe-clays with their masses of lignite\r\nto present a strong resemblance to the Bagshot group in the Tertiary\r\nseries. It is possible, as already suggested, that the pipe-clays and\r\nlignites may belong to the sedimentary zone that separates the lower\r\nand upper basalts of Antrim. At all events they furnish no proof of\r\nany Pliocene lake, and may not indicate more than a deeper part of the\r\ndepression in which the tuffs, lignites and iron-ore were laid down.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the _Mytilus_-clay shows that in Glacial or\r\npost-Glacial times the valley of the Bann was a strait or fjord into\r\nwhich the sea entered. Thick masses of drift have been laid down all\r\nround and over the depression now occupied by Lough Neagh, insomuch\r\nthat had any older lake existed here in Glacial times, it could hardly\r\nhave escaped being filled up.\r\n\r\nThe observer, who from one of the basalt-heights looks down upon the\r\nexpanse of Lough Neagh and the broad peat-covered plain that continues\r\nthe level platform of the lake-surface down the valley of the Bann,\r\ncannot but be impressed with the size of this wide hollow in the heart\r\nof the Antrim plateau, and with the evident continuity of the whole\r\ndepression from the lake to the sea. If he be a geologist, he will\r\nbe further struck by the fact that while the Chalk and other older\r\nrocks appear from under the basalt-escarpments all round the plateau,\r\nat heights of many hundred feet above the sea, the floor of this\r\nwide hollow is entirely covered with basalt. Had the depression been\r\nmerely due to denudation, the rocks that underlie the volcanic series\r\nwould have been exposed to view. The base of the basalts which, on\r\neither side of the depression, is often more than 1000 feet above the\r\nsea-level, sinks below that level in the hollow of the Bann and Lough\r\nNeagh.\r\n\r\nThis inequality of position may have been partially brought about by\r\nfaults like those around Lough Neagh, and may thus have been begun long\r\nbefore the Glacial period. But it appears to me to be mainly due to a\r\nwide subsidence, of which the axis ran in a N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction\r\nfrom the present coast up the valley of the Bann and the basin of Lough\r\nNeagh to beyond Portadown.\r\n\r\nWe may conceive that after the cessation of the outflows of basalt,\r\nthe territory overlying the lava-reservoir that had been emptied would\r\ntend to subside, partly by ruptures of the crust producing faults\r\nand partly by a downward movement of a more general kind. In course\r\nof time, these disturbances turned the drainage into the hollow now\r\ntraversed by the Bann. Denudation would necessarily accompany them, and\r\nthe surface of the country would be continually eroded and lowered.\r\n\r\nLough Neagh has been carefully sounded by the Admiralty, and its\r\nchart affords much suggestive material for the consideration of the\r\ngeologist.[436] From the soundings there given it has long been known\r\nthat the lake deepens towards its northern end, and attains a maximum\r\ndepth of 102 feet. But it is not until we trace on the chart a series\r\nof contour-lines for successive depths, as shown by the soundings, that\r\nwe realize the remarkable form of the lake bottom. We then discover\r\nthat below a depth of 50 feet a well-defined channel extends for\r\nrather more than half the length of the lake. This channel begins to\r\nbe distinctly perceptible between Kiltagh Point and Langford Lodge. It\r\nfirst runs in a northerly course on the west side of the centre of the\r\nLough, but when it comes into a line with Saltera Castle on the western\r\nshore, it wheels round so as to conform to the curve of the Antrim\r\ncoast-line, which it follows northward until, about two miles from the\r\nexit of the lake, its outline ceases to be traceable on the gently\r\nshelving bottom. Its total length is thus about 12 miles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 436: Lough Neagh surveyed and sounded by Lieut. Thomas Graves,\r\nR.N.]\r\n\r\nThere can hardly be any doubt that this channel is a former bed of the\r\nRiver Bann. It occupies exactly the position which that stream would\r\ntake if the lake were drained, and its depth and breadth correspond to\r\nthose of the valley-bottom of the present river. If this conclusion be\r\naccepted, some important conclusions may be further deduced from it.\r\n\r\n1. The presence of a former course of the Bann on the bottom of Lough\r\nNeagh proves the lake to be much younger than the Ice Age. The thick\r\nboulder-clays and Glacial gravels which so encumber the country\r\naround and descend under the lake, would assuredly have filled up the\r\nriver-channel had it existed at the time of their deposition. The\r\nchannel has obviously been cut out of these drifts since the Glacial\r\nperiod. When the erosion took place, the present Lough Neagh could\r\nnot have existed, but the Bann followed a continuous course across\r\nthe plain which the lake now covers. The river probably maintained\r\nits place for a long period, so as to be able to excavate so wide and\r\ndeep a bed in the drifts, if, indeed, it did not to some extent slowly\r\ncarve its bed out of the underlying basalts. It must be remembered that\r\nsediment is being continually poured into Lough Neagh, and that some\r\nof the silt must have accumulated in the submerged river-course, thus\r\nlessening its depth and width. That the channel should still be so\r\nmarked may be used as an argument for the comparatively late date of\r\nthe subsidence.\r\n\r\n2. The submerged river-course is a clear proof of subsidence. The\r\npresent Lough Neagh cannot be looked upon as a glacial lake formed by\r\nrock-erosion or by irregular deposition of drift. Its floor must have\r\nbeen a land surface when the Bann cut out its bed upon it. The whole\r\narea has sunk down, the drainage has been arrested, and some 20 miles\r\nof the course of the Bann are now under a sheet of shallow water.\r\nThis subsidence was not brought about by faults. It seems rather to\r\nhave resulted from a general sinking of the ground. The movement was\r\nprobably comparatively rapid, otherwise the river-course would hardly\r\nhave survived so well.\r\n\r\n3. These inferences, based upon purely geological considerations, have\r\nan interesting bearing upon the allusions to the origin of Lough Neagh\r\ncontained in some ancient historical documents. Various legends have\r\nfrom an early period been handed down as to the first appearance of\r\nthis sheet of water. These myths, though differing in details, agree in\r\ndescribing such a sudden or rapid accumulation of water as destroyed\r\nhuman life, in a district which had previously been inhabited by man.\r\nThe earliest records indicate that the alleged catastrophe took place\r\nin the first century of the Christian era.[437] It appears to me not\r\nimprobable that the tradition,thus preserved in these legends, may\r\nhave had its basis in the actual disturbance which, on geological\r\ngrounds, can be shown to have determined the existence of Lough Neagh.\r\nThough the event may go back far beyond the first century, there can\r\nbe no doubt that, in a geological sense, it was one of the most recent\r\ntopographical changes which the British Isles have undergone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 437: For versions of the legends, see Dr. Todd's \"Irish Version\r\nof the Historia Britonum of Nennius,\" _Roy. Hist, and Archæol. Assoc.\r\nIreland_; Dr. Reeves' \"Ecclesiastical Antiquities of Down,\" etc., p.\r\n370; Mr. J. O'Beirne Crowe's \"Ancient Lake Legends of Ireland,\" No. 1\r\nin _Journ. Roy. Hist. and Archæol. Assoc. Ireland_, vol. i. (1870-71),\r\np. 94; _Giraldus Cambrensis_, vol. v. cap. ix. p. 91--\"de lacu magno\r\nmiram originem habente.\" Moore's well-known lines embody the popular\r\nbelief that round towers and other buildings were submerged by the\r\ninundation.]\r\n\r\nThus the Antrim basalt-plateau, in addition to the high interest of its\r\nvolcanic history, has the additional claim to our attention that it\r\nhas preserved, more fully and clearly than any other of the plateaux,\r\nthe evidence for the latest subterranean movements that followed the\r\nlong series of volcanic eruptions during Tertiary time. It contains the\r\nrecord of a post-Glacial subsidence that gave birth to the largest lake\r\nin Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. DISLOCATIONS\r\n\r\nThough I have not observed any features among the Tertiary\r\nbasalt-plateaux of the British Isles that can be compared to the\r\nremarkable rifts and subsidences of Iceland, it can be shown that these\r\npiles of volcanic material have undoubtedly been fractured, and that\r\nportions of them have subsided along the lines of dislocation.\r\n\r\nCareful examination of the basalt-escarpments of the Inner Hebrides\r\ndiscloses the existence of numerous faults which, though generally\r\nof small displacement, nevertheless completely break the continuity\r\nof all the rocks in a precipice of 700 or 1000 feet in height. Not\r\ninfrequently such dislocations give rise to clefts in the cliffs. Some\r\ngood illustrations of this feature may be noticed on the north side\r\nof the island of Canna, where the precipice has been fissured by a\r\nseries of dislocations, having a hade towards the west and a throw\r\nwhich may in some cases amount to about 20 or 25 feet. The cumulative\r\neffect of this system of faulting, combined with a gentle westerly\r\ndip, is to bring down to the sea-level the upper band of conglomerate\r\nwhich further to the east lies at the top of the cliff. Again, the\r\nbasalt-escarpment on the west side of Skye, from Dunvegan Head to Loch\r\nEynort, is traversed by a series of small faults. On the east side of\r\nSkye and in Raasay, a number of faults, some of them having perhaps a\r\nthrow of several hundred feet, has been mapped by Mr. H. B. Woodward.\r\n\r\nThe largest dislocation observed by me among the basalt-plateaux of\r\nthe Inner Hebrides is that already referred to (p. 209), which runs at\r\nthe back of the Morven outlier, in the west of Argyllshire, from the\r\nSound of Mull by the head of Loch Aline to the mouth of Loch Sunart,\r\nalong the line of valley that contains the salt-water fjord Loch Teacus\r\nand the fresh-water lakes Loch Durinemast and Loch Arienas. While the\r\nCretaceous deposits and the bottom of their overlying basalts rise but\r\nlittle above the sea-level on the south-west side of this line, they\r\nare perched as outliers on hill-tops on the north-east side, where they\r\nrise to 1300 feet above the sea. The amount of vertical displacement\r\nhere probably exceeds 1000 feet. The fault runs in a north-westerly\r\ndirection, and has obviously been the guiding influence in the erosion\r\nof the broad and deep valley which marks its course at the surface.\r\n\r\nThis dislocation is only the largest of a number by which the\r\nbasalt-plateau has been broken in the district of Morven. Their effects\r\nare well shown in the outlier of basalt which caps Ben Iadain, where\r\ntwo parallel faults bring down the lavas against the platform of\r\nschists on which they lie (see Fig. 266).\r\n\r\nMany faults have been traced in the Antrim plateau, and are represented\r\non the Geological Survey Maps. In general they are of comparatively\r\ntrifling displacement. Occasionally, however, they amount to several\r\nhundred feet, as in those already referred to as occurring near\r\nBallycastle and around the southern part of the basin of Lough Neagh.\r\n\r\nTo what extent the dislocations that traverse the British Tertiary\r\nbasalts are to be regarded as comparable to those which in Iceland\r\nhave been referred to subsidence caused by the tapping and outflow of\r\nthe lower still liquid parts of lava-sheets must be matter for further\r\ninquiry. So far as my own observations have yet gone, the faults do not\r\nseem explicable by any mere superficial action of the kind supposed.\r\nWhere they descend through many hundreds of feet of successive sheets\r\nof basalt, and dislocate the Secondary formations underneath, they\r\nmust obviously have been produced by much more general and deep-seated\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that, if these dislocations took place during the\r\nvolcanic period, they broke up the lava-plains into sections, some\r\nof which sank down so as to leave a vertical wall at the surface on\r\none side of the rent, or even to form open \"gjás,\" like those of\r\nIceland. But it is noteworthy that the fissures, which have been filled\r\nwith basalt and now appear as dykes, comparatively seldom show any\r\ndisplacement in the relative levels of their two sides. In Iceland,\r\nalso, the great lava-emitting fissures seem to be in general free from\r\nmarked displacements of that kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 382.--Reversed fault on the eastern side of Svinö,\r\nFaroe Isles.]\r\n\r\nThe faults in the Inner Hebrides, so far as I have observed, are all\r\nnormal, and indicate nothing more than gentle subsidence. But among the\r\nFaroe Islands I have come upon several instances of reversed faults,\r\nwhich, in spite of the usually gentle inclinations of the basalts,\r\nprobably point to more vigorous displacement within the terrestrial\r\ncrust.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of Svinö a fault with a low hade runs from sea-level\r\nup to the top of the cliff, a height of several hundred feet. It has\r\na down-throw of a few yards, but is a reversed fault, as will be\r\nseen from Fig. 382. Another similar instance may be noticed on the\r\nnorth-east headland of Sandö, where, however, on the upcast side, the\r\nbasalts appear as if they had been driven upward, a portion of them\r\nhaving been pushed up into a low arch (Fig. 383).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 383.--Reversed fault on the north-east headland of\r\nSandö, Faroe Isle.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Tertiary basalt-plateaux of the Hebrides and the Faroe\r\nIsles come to be worked out in detail, many examples of dislocation\r\nwill doubtless be discovered. We shall then learn more of the amount\r\nand effects of the terrestrial disturbances which have affected\r\nNorth-Western Europe since older Tertiary time. In the meantime\r\nevidence enough has been adduced to prepare us for proofs of very\r\nconsiderable recent displacements even among regions of crystalline\r\nschists, like that which has been disrupted by the Morven faults above\r\nalluded to. While the study of the Tertiary volcanic rocks demonstrates\r\nthe vast general denudation of the country since older Tertiary time,\r\nthe proofs that these rocks have been faulted acquire a special\r\ninterest in relation to the origin and evolution of the topography of\r\nthe region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER L\r\n\r\n                         EFFECTS OF DENUDATION\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the more impressive lessons which the basalt-plateaux of\r\nNorth-Western Europe teach the geologist, the enormous erosion of the\r\nsurface of this part of the continental area since older Tertiary time\r\ntakes a foremost place. He may be ready almost without question to\r\naccept the evidence adduced in favour of a vast amount of denudation\r\namong such soft and incoherent strata as those of the older Tertiary\r\nformations of the south-east of England or the north-west of France.\r\nBut he is hardly prepared for the proofs which meet him among the\r\nnorth-western isles that such thick masses of solid volcanic rocks have\r\nbeen removed during the same geological interval.\r\n\r\nTo gain some idea of the amount of this waste we must, in the first\r\nplace, picture to our minds the extent of ground over which the lavas\r\nwere poured, and the depth to which they were piled upon it. Though we\r\nmay never be able to ascertain whether the now isolated basalt-plateaux\r\nof Britain were once united into a continuous plain of lava, we can\r\nbe quite certain that every one of these plateaux was formerly more\r\nextensive than it is now, for each of them presents, as its terminal\r\nedge, a line of wall formed by the truncated ends of horizontal\r\nbasalt-sheets. And there seems no improbability in the assumption that\r\nthe whole of the great hollow from the centre of Antrim up to the Minch\r\nwas flooded with lavas which flowed from many vents between the hills\r\nof ancient crystalline rocks forming the line of the Outer Hebrides on\r\nthe west, and those of the mainland of Scotland on the east.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the depth to which some parts of this long hollow\r\nwere overflowed with lava exceeded 3000 feet, for more than that depth\r\nof rock can be shown to have been in some places removed. The original\r\ninequalities of surface were buried under the volcanic materials which\r\nwere spread out in a vast plain or series of plains, like those that\r\nhave been deluged by modern eruptions in Iceland. Owing, however, to a\r\ngeneral but unequal movement of subsidence, the lava-fields sank down\r\nhere and there to, perhaps, an extent of several hundred feet, so that\r\nthe old land-surface on which they began to be poured out now lies in\r\nthose places below the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nI have shown that even during the volcanic period, while the lavas\r\nwere still flowing from time to time, erosion was in active progress\r\nover the surface of the volcanic plain. The records of river-action in\r\nCanna and Sanday, and the buried river-channel of the Scuir of Eigg,\r\nprove that, while eruptions still continued, rivers descending from\r\nthe mountains of the Western Highlands carried the detritus of these\r\nuplands for many miles across the lava-fields, swept away the loose\r\nmaterial of volcanic cones, and cut channels for themselves out of the\r\nblack rugged floor of basalt.\r\n\r\nThe erosion thus early begun has probably been carried on continuously\r\never since. The present streams may be looked upon as practically the\r\nsame as those which were flowing in the Tertiary period. There may have\r\nbeen slight changes of level, oscillations both upward and downward\r\nin the relative positions of land and sea, and shiftings of the\r\nwater-courses to one side or other; but there seems no reason to doubt\r\nthat the existing basalt-plateaux, which were built up as terrestrial\r\nareas, have remained land-surfaces with little intermission ever since,\r\nalthough their lower portions may have been in large measure submerged.\r\n\r\nIn the existing valleys, fjords and sea-straits by which these plateaux\r\nhave been so deeply and abundantly trenched, we may recognize some of\r\nthe drainage-lines traced out by the rivers which flowed across the\r\nvolcanic plains. The results achieved by this prolonged denudation are\r\nof the most stupendous kind. The original lava-floor has been cut down\r\ninto a fragmentary tableland. Hundreds of feet of solid rock have been\r\nremoved from its general surface. Outliers of it may be seen scattered\r\nover the mountains of Morven, whence they look into the heart of the\r\nHighlands. Others cap the hills of Rum, where they face the open\r\nAtlantic. Several miles from the main body of the plateau in Skye,\r\na solitary remnant, perched on the highest summit of Raasay, bears\r\neloquent witness that the basaltic tableland once stretched far to the\r\neast of its present limits.\r\n\r\nTwo lines of observation and of argument may be followed in the effort\r\nto demonstrate how great the denudation has been since older Tertiary\r\ntime. In the first place, there is the evidence of the level or nearly\r\nlevel sheets of basalt that form the plateaux, and, in the second\r\nplace, there is the testimony of the dykes, sills and bosses by which\r\nthese lavas have been disrupted.\r\n\r\n1. The study of the denudation of the Tertiary volcanic rocks of\r\nNorth-Western Europe is most satisfactorily begun by an attempt to\r\nmeasure the minimum amount of waste which in certain places the\r\nbasalt-plateaux can be proved to have undergone. For the purposes\r\nof this study, the stratification of the lavas and their nearly\r\nhorizontal, or at least very slightly disturbed, position afford\r\nexceptional facilities. Amorphous rocks, such as granites and gabbros,\r\nor even foliated masses like the old gneisses and schists, may have\r\nbeen enormously denuded. Their mere presence at the existing surface\r\nmay be taken as proof of such waste, yet they furnish in themselves no\r\ncriterion by which the amount of removed material may be estimated.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of the basalt-plateaux, as in that of horizontal\r\nsedimentary formations, the successive lines of superposition of the\r\ncomponent beds of the whole stratigraphical series supply admirable\r\ndatum-lines which, on the one hand, vividly impress the imagination\r\nby the demonstration which they afford of the reality and magnitude of\r\nthe denudation, and, on the other hand, furnish a measure by which the\r\nminimum amount of this denudation may be actually computed.\r\n\r\nAvailing ourselves of this kind of evidence it is easy to show that\r\nvalleys many miles long, several miles broad, and from crest to\r\nbottom several thousand feet deep, have been excavated out of the\r\nbasalt-plateaux since the close of the volcanic period. And if this\r\nconclusion can be demonstrated for these plateaux, it must obviously\r\napply equally to the rest of the country. We thus obtain a most\r\nimportant contribution to the investigation of the origin and relative\r\nage of the present topographical features of the surface of the land.\r\n\r\nLet me give a few illustrations of the nature of the investigation\r\nand of the results to which it leads. Throughout the Western and\r\nFaroe Islands the level bars of basalt present their truncated ends\r\nin the great escarpment-cliffs which wind mile after mile along their\r\npicturesque coasts. Where they front the open sea, it is obviously\r\nimpossible to say how much further seaward they once extended. But\r\nwhere they retire in fjords or sea-lochs, and sweep inland into glens,\r\nit is easy to measure the distance from the bottom of the eroded hollow\r\nto its bounding watersheds, and to estimate the amount of material\r\nthat has been worn out of it. The only uncertainty in this computation\r\narises from our inability to determine to what extent movements of\r\nsubsidence may have come into play to aid in the disappearance of the\r\nbasalts. Where the bottom of the lavas can be seen at the same level\r\non either side of an inlet, with no evidence of faulting, or where a\r\ndefinite horizon in the volcanic series can be traced round the head\r\nof a glen or sea-loch, the influence of underground movements may be\r\neliminated. The evidence of vast denudation is always visible, the\r\nproofs of subsidence are much less frequently observable.\r\n\r\nThe island of Mull supplies many striking examples of the enormous\r\nwaste of the basalt-plateau. The Sound of Mull, for instance, has been\r\neroded out of the volcanic series for a distance of 20 miles, with a\r\nmean breadth of about two miles. From the deepest part of this fjord\r\nto the summit of the Mull plateau is a vertical height of 3600 feet.\r\nThe whole of this vast excavation has taken place since older Tertiary\r\ntime. On the opposite side of Mull the hollow of Loch Scridain has been\r\neroded to a mean depth of at least 1200 feet below the average level of\r\nthe surrounding plateau, with a breadth of rather more than a mile.\r\n\r\nThe scattered islands which lie to the west of Mull tell the same tale.\r\nThey are all outliers of the same basalt-plateau, and have not only\r\nbeen greatly lowered by the removal of their upper lavas, but have been\r\nseparated by the erosion of long and deep hollows between them. Thus\r\nfrom the summit of the Gribon cliffs in Mull to the deepest part of the\r\nsea-floor between that precipice and the Treshnish Isles a vertical\r\ndepth of at least 2000 feet of rock has been removed since the basalts\r\nceased to be erupted.\r\n\r\nI have referred to the impressive evidence of denudation displayed\r\non the west side of the island of Eigg. The vertical distance from\r\nthe summit of the Eigg plateau to the bottom of the submarine valley\r\nbetween this island and Rum is about 1500 feet, but as that summit lies\r\nbelow the original surface of the lava-field, the depth of rock which\r\nhas been removed must exceed 1500 feet. We thus learn that since the\r\nclose of the volcanic period the hollow between the islands of Eigg and\r\nRum has been eroded to this great depth.\r\n\r\nStill more striking is the evidence of enormous waste presented by the\r\nFaroe Islands. The cliffs there are loftier and barer, and the fjords\r\nhave been cut more deeply and precipitously out of the basalt-plateau.\r\nI shall never forget the first impression made on my mind when the\r\ndense curtain of mist within which I had approached the southern end\r\nof the archipelago rapidly cleared away, and the sunlit slopes and\r\nprecipices of Suderö, the two Dimons, Skuö and Sandö, rose out of a\r\ndeep blue sea. Each island showed its prolongation of the same long\r\nlevel lines of rock-terrace. The eye at once seized on these features\r\nas the dominant element in the geology and the topography, for they\r\nrevealed at a glance the true structure of the islands, and gave a\r\nmeasure of the amount and irregularity of the erosion of the original\r\nbasalt-plateau. And this first impression of stupendous degradation\r\nonly deepened as one advanced further north into the more mountainous\r\ngroup of islands. Probably nowhere else in Europe is the potency of\r\ndenudation as a factor in the evolution of topographical features so\r\nmarvellously and instructively displayed as among the north-eastern\r\nmembers of the Faroe group.\r\n\r\nAvailing ourselves of the datum-lines supplied by the nearly level\r\nbars of basalt, we easily perceive that in many parts of the Faroe\r\nIsles the amount of volcanic material left behind, stupendous though\r\nit be, is less than the amount which has been removed. Thus the island\r\nof Kalsö is merely a long narrow ridge separating two broad valleys\r\nwhich are now occupied by fjords. The material carved out of these\r\nvalleys would make several islands as large as Kalsö. Again, the lofty\r\nprecipice of Myling Head, 2260 feet high, built up of bedded basalts\r\nfrom the summit to below sea-level, faces the north-western Atlantic,\r\nand the sea rapidly deepens in front of it to the surface of the\r\nsubmarine ridge 200 to 300 feet below. The truncated ends of the vast\r\npile of basalt-sheets which form that loftiest sea-wall of Europe bears\r\ntestimony to the colossal denudation which has swept away all of the\r\nvolcanic plateau that once extended further towards the west.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, enormous as has been the waste of this plateau of the\r\nFaroe Islands, we may still trace some of its terrestrial features\r\nthat date back probably to the volcanic period. Even more distinctly,\r\nperhaps, than among the Western Isles of Scotland, we may recognize the\r\nposition of the original valleys, and trace some of the main drainage\r\nlines of the area when it formed a wide and continuous tract of land.\r\n\r\nA line of watershed can be followed in a south-westerly direction\r\nfrom the east side of Viderö, across Borö to the centre of Osterö,\r\nand thence by the Sund across Stromö and Vaagö. From this line the\r\nfjords and valleys diverge towards the north-west and south-east.\r\nThere can hardly be any doubt that on the whole this line corresponds\r\nwith the general trend of the water-parting at the time when the\r\nTertiary streams were flowing over the still continuous volcanic plain.\r\nConsiderable depression of the whole region has since then sent the\r\nsea up the lower and wider valleys, converting them into fjords, and\r\nisolating their intervening ridges into islands.\r\n\r\nThe topography of the Faroe Islands seems to me eminently deserving of\r\ncareful study in the light of its geological origin. There is assuredly\r\nno other region in Europe where the interesting problems presented\r\nby this subject could be studied so easily, where the geological\r\nstructure is throughout so simple, where the combined influences of\r\nthe atmosphere and of the sea could be so admirably worked out and\r\ndistinguished, and where the imagination, kindled to enthusiasm by the\r\ncontemplation of noble scenery, could be so constantly and imperiously\r\ncontrolled by the accurate observation of ascertainable fact.\r\n\r\n2. Impressive and easily comprehended as are the proofs of denudation\r\nsupplied by the basalts of the plateaux, they are perhaps to a\r\ngeological eye less overwhelming than those furnished by the eruptive\r\nrocks which have been injected into these plateaux. In the case of at\r\nleast the basic intrusions, we may reasonably infer that they assumed\r\ntheir present position under a greater or less depth of overlying rock\r\nwhich has since been removed. When, therefore, they are found at or\r\nabove the summits of the plateaux, they demonstrate that a vast amount\r\nof material has been removed from these summits.\r\n\r\nThe argument from the position of the dykes has already been enforced.\r\nIt is absolutely certain that valleys several thousand feet deep\r\nmust have been excavated since these dykes were erupted, for had\r\nsuch valleys existed at the time when the dykes were injected across\r\ntheir site, the molten rock, instead of ascending to the tops of the\r\nsurrounding mountains, would obviously have rushed forth over the\r\nvalley-bottoms. I have shown that this reasoning applies not merely to\r\nthe volcanic districts, but to the whole surface of the country within\r\nthe region of dykes. Thus the uplands of Southern Scotland, and wide\r\nareas in the Southern and Western Highlands, can be proved to have had\r\nglens cut out of their mass to a depth of hundreds of feet since the\r\nTertiary volcanic period.\r\n\r\nNot less convincing is the evidence afforded by the great eruptive\r\nmasses of gabbro. We have seen that these complex accumulations of\r\nsills, dykes, and bosses include rocks so coarse in grain as to show\r\nthat they must have consolidated at some considerable depth, but that\r\nthey now appear in hill-groups 2000 to 3000 feet in height, the whole\r\nof the original basaltic cover having been stripped off from them. But\r\nthese gabbro hills have been in turn traversed up to the very crests by\r\nlater basalt-dykes, which thus supply additional proof that the erosion\r\nhere has been stupendous.\r\n\r\nThe granophyre bosses tell the same tale. Though, like the domite Puys\r\nof Auvergne, they may still retain, in their conical forms, indications\r\nof the original shapes which their component material assumed at\r\nthe time of its protrusion, we may be confident that their existing\r\nsurfaces have been reached after the removal of much rock which once\r\nlay above them. This inference is confirmed by the fact that these\r\neruptive bosses have been invaded by a younger system of dykes. The\r\nblack ribs of basalt which may be traced along their pale declivities,\r\nwhich cross the glens that have been eroded in them and which mount\r\nup to their very crests, prove that since the latest manifestations\r\nof volcanic energy in the West of Scotland, extensive changes in the\r\ntopography of the land have been effected by the operation of the\r\nsubærial agents of degradation.\r\n\r\nSo much for what can be demonstrated. But how much more may, with the\r\nhighest probability, be inferred! The original limits of the plateaux\r\nare unknown. The waves of the wide Atlantic now roll over many a square\r\nleague of the old lava-plains, and wide tracts of the islands and the\r\nmainland from which the basalt has been entirely stripped, or where it\r\nremains only in scattered outliers, were once deeply buried under piles\r\nof lava-sheets. It would probably be no exaggeration to affirm that\r\nover the British area, as well as over the Faroe Isles, the amount of\r\nTertiary volcanic rock that now remains, large as it is, falls short\r\nin amount of what has been removed. The geologist who has made himself\r\nfamiliar with the effects of denudation in other Tertiary volcanic\r\ndistricts, such as Central France, Saxony and Bohemia, will be prepared\r\nfor almost any conceivable amount of erosion among the far older\r\nvolcanic series of the north-west of Europe.\r\n\r\nTo the student of the origin of the existing topography of the land\r\nthere is a profound interest in the demonstration which these volcanic\r\nrocks supply of the vast changes which the terrestrial surface has\r\nundergone within a period geologically so recent as older Tertiary\r\ntime. When, on the one hand, he finds himself more and more restricted\r\nin his demands for time by the confident assertions of the physicist\r\nthat all the phenomena of geological history must have been comprised\r\nwithin a few millions of years, and when, on the other hand, he watches\r\nthe seemingly feeble and tardy operations of the forces of denudation\r\nand sedimentation which have played the chief parts in that history,\r\nhe may well be excused if sometimes he is apt to despair of ever\r\nreconciling the facts which he observes with the physical deductions\r\nthat are somewhat dogmatically brought forward in opposition to his\r\ninterpretation of them. He may feel sure that his facts cannot be\r\ngainsaid, and he may be unable to find any other way of comprehending\r\nthem save by the admission that they necessitate a liberal allowance\r\nof time. Yet he may not feel himself to be in a position to offer any\r\nvalid objections to the arguments from physical considerations that\r\nwould so seriously abridge the length of time which geology requires.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances it is some satisfaction to be provided with\r\ndefinite measurements of the amount of geological change which has\r\nbeen effected within a limited and relatively recent period of time.\r\nThis change has resulted from the operation of the same agents by\r\nwhich it is still being carried on. No break in the history can be\r\ndetected. There is not the least reason to suppose that the agents\r\nof denudation and sedimentation have, during the period in question,\r\ndiffered in their rate of working. Their activity at the present time\r\nis probably neither greater nor less than it was then. If, therefore,\r\nduring so recent an interval such a stupendous amount of material\r\nhas been worn away from the surface of the land and deposited on the\r\nsea-floor as the Tertiary volcanic rocks demonstrate, the geologist\r\nmay surely contemplate without misgiving the lapse of time required\r\nfor the completion of older geological revolutions. He may oppose\r\nto the arguments of the physicist the measurements and computations\r\nwhich he himself makes from data which are at least as reliable as\r\nthe postulates whereon these arguments are based. The rate at which\r\ndenudation and sedimentation are now taking place has been measured\r\nwith tolerable accuracy, and a fair average for it has been obtained.\r\nWhatever may be maintained as to this rate in early geological ages,\r\nthere can be no serious opposition to its being taken as fairly\r\nconstant since older Tertiary time. We are thus provided with data for\r\nestimating the minimum amount of time that can have elapsed since the\r\nvolcanic plateaux began to be denuded. But as no relic remains of the\r\noriginal upper surface of those plateaux, and as we are consequently\r\nignorant of how much rock has been removed from their highest surviving\r\noutliers, it is obvious that such estimates are more likely to err in\r\nunderstating than overstating the amount of time required.\r\n\r\nIt would be beyond the scope of the present volume to enter fully into\r\nthe measurements and calculations required for the adequate treatment\r\nof this subject. I will merely illustrate my argument by again taking a\r\nfew data from the plateau of Mull. The original height of this plateau\r\nis shown by the outlier of Ben More to have been at least 3200 feet.\r\nIf to this figure we add the portion of the basalt-group submerged\r\nunder the sea the height will probably be increased by several hundred\r\nfeet. But let us take 3000 feet as a moderate computation for the\r\naverage thickness of the volcanic series here at the close of the\r\nplateau-period. Until a number of sections have been carefully plotted\r\nfrom the Ordnance Maps, in order to ascertain with approximate accuracy\r\nthe average height of the present surface of the Mull basaltic plateau,\r\nmaking due allowance for the vast erosion of the Sound of Mull and the\r\nnumerous glens and sea-lochs that traverse the island, any estimate\r\nwhich may be offered as to this average must be merely provisional.\r\nIf, in the meantime, we suppose the present mean level of the plateau\r\nto be 1000 feet above the sea, the difference between this amount and\r\nthe assumed original height will be 2000 feet. If, further, we take the\r\npresent average rate of degradation of the Mull plateau to be 1/6000 of\r\na foot in a year, which has been shown to be probably a fair estimate,\r\nthen the time required for the lowering of the Mull plateau from its\r\noriginal to its present average level amounts to twelve millions of\r\nyears. Yet this period, vast though it be, does not carry us back even\r\nas far as the beginning of Tertiary time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn concluding this lengthened discussion of the Tertiary volcanic\r\nhistory of Britain, I may, perhaps, usefully add a brief summary of the\r\nleading features of the long record.\r\n\r\nThe region within which volcanic activity displayed itself during older\r\nTertiary time in the British Isles, if our estimate of its area is\r\nrestricted to those parts of the country where igneous rocks, probably\r\nof that age, now appear at the surface, embraces the North of England\r\nand of Ireland, the southern half and the west coast of Scotland--a\r\ntotal area of more than 40,000 square miles. Over that extensive region\r\nvolcanic phenomena were displayed during an enormously protracted\r\ninterval of geological time. The earliest beginnings of disturbance may\r\npossibly have started in the Eocene, and the final manifestations may\r\nnot have ceased until the Miocene period. So prolonged was the duration\r\nof the eruptions, that enormous topographical changes from denudation,\r\nand probably also considerable variation in the fauna and flora, alike\r\nof land and sea, may have been effected.\r\n\r\nOwing to some cause which has not yet in this relation been\r\ninvestigated, but which is probably referable to secular terrestrial\r\ncontraction, the volcanic region underwent elevation, while, at the\r\nsame time, a vast subterranean lake or sea of molten rock existed\r\nunderneath it. Enormous horizontal tension thus arose, and at last\r\nthe stretched terrestrial crust gave way. A system of approximately\r\nparallel fissures opened in it, having a general direction towards\r\nnorth-west. The rapid and simultaneous production of such a gigantic\r\nseries of rents must have given rise to earthquakes of enormous\r\nmagnitude and destructive force. The great majority of the fractures,\r\ndoubtless, did not reach to the surface of the ground, though\r\nprobably not a few did so. Such was the potency of this development\r\nof terrestrial energy, that the fissures ran through the most varied\r\nkinds of rocks and the most complicated geological structures, crossing\r\neven earlier lines of powerful dislocation, and yet retaining their\r\ndirection and parallelism for sometimes 50 or 100 miles.\r\n\r\nInto the fissures thus formed the molten magma from underneath was\r\nforced for many hundreds or even thousands of feet above the surface\r\nof the subterranean lava-reservoir. Solidifying between the fissure\r\nwalls, it formed the crowd of basic dykes that stand out as the most\r\nwidespread and distinctive feature of the volcanic region.\r\n\r\nWhere the fissures reached the surface or near to it, the molten\r\nrock would seek relief by egress in streams of lava. This probably\r\noccurred in many places from which subsequent denudation has removed\r\nall vestige of superficial volcanic manifestations. But, in the great\r\nrange of basalt-plateaux, from Antrim northwards through the chain\r\nof the Inner Hebrides, there are still left abundant remains of the\r\nsurface-outflows. Like the modern lavas of Iceland, the molten material\r\nprobably flowed out sometimes from the open fissures, sometimes\r\nfrom vents formed along the chasms. After the convulsions ceased\r\nwhich produced the earliest dykes, the communication that had been\r\nestablished between the magma-reservoir underneath and the air above\r\nwould be maintained, and repeated eruptions might take place, either\r\nfrom the original fissures and vents or from others afterwards opened\r\nby the volcanic energy.\r\n\r\nAs in the modern eruptions of Iceland, new fissures are successively\r\nopened through the older lava-sheets, so in the Tertiary volcanic\r\nareas, renewed ruptures of the earth's crust allowed later dykes to be\r\nformed. The basalt-plateaux are traversed by such dykes, even up to\r\ntheir highest sheets. It is impossible to say how often the process of\r\ndyke-making may have been repeated. Not improbably it recurred again\r\nand again during the building of the basalt-plateaux, and we know that\r\nit was renewed even after the protrusion of the granophyre bosses which\r\nmark one of the latest phases of volcanism in the region.\r\n\r\nFor a protracted geological period, with long intervals of quiescence,\r\nvarious basic lavas (basalts, dolerites, etc.), with occasionally some\r\nof intermediate composition (andesites, trachytes), and perhaps in\r\nAntrim acid rhyolites, flowed out from fissures and vents until they\r\nhad filled up the hollows of the great valley, which then stretched\r\nfrom the south of Antrim northwards between the west coast of Scotland\r\nand the chain of the Outer Hebrides. In some places the accumulated\r\npile of these ejections even now exceeds 3000 feet in thickness, but\r\nwe cannot tell how much material has been bared away from its top\r\nby denudation. The volcanic discharges consisted mostly of lava,\r\nfragmentary materials being comparatively insignificant in amount and\r\nlocal in origin, though layers of fine tuff and basalt-breccias occur\r\nin all the plateaux. None of the erupted materials thicken towards any\r\ncentres that might be taken to mark volcanoes of the type of Vesuvius\r\nor Etna. On the contrary, the persistent flatness and uniformity of\r\nthe volcanic series, and the thinning out of the separate beds in\r\ndifferent directions, show that the lavas issued from many points all\r\nover the region. The positions of some of the actual vents can still\r\nbe ascertained. They are now filled sometimes with dolerite, sometimes\r\nwith coarse agglomerate.\r\n\r\nThe surface over which the lava flowed seems to have been mainly\r\nterrestrial. Here and there, between the successive sheets of basalt,\r\nthe leaves, stems, and fruit of land-plants, sometimes in most perfect\r\npreservation, may be observed, together with the remains of insects\r\nand fresh-water fish. Distinct relics of old river-channels can be\r\nrecognized which have been buried under streams of lava. Among the\r\ndeposits left by these streams the uppermost layers are commonly dark\r\nwith decayed vegetation, while layers of coal are found here and there\r\nbetween the basalts.\r\n\r\nAs the pile of erupted materials gradually thickened, and the\r\nsubterranean energy possibly grew feebler, the ascending magma was\r\nforced between the layers of sedimentary strata underneath the basalts,\r\nor between these strata and the overlying volcanic series, or along\r\nany other plane of weakness in the terrestrial crust. In this way arose\r\nthe multitudinous sills or intrusive sheets.\r\n\r\nWhen the great volcanic plateaux had been built up to a thickness\r\nof several thousand feet, another remarkable episode in the history\r\noccurred. At certain points large bodies of coarsely crystalline basic\r\nrocks were pushed into and through the plateaux-basalts, upraising them\r\nin dome-shaped elevations, and ultimately solidifying as dolerites,\r\ngabbros, troctolites, picrites, etc. There is reason to believe that\r\nthe points of extravasation of these materials were mainly determined\r\nby the positions of the larger or more closely clustered vents of the\r\nplateau-period, where points of weakness consequently existed in the\r\nterrestrial crust. Rising as huge bosses through such weak places,\r\nthe gabbros and associated rocks raised up the overlying bedded\r\nbasalts, and forced themselves between them, forming thus a fringe of\r\nfiner-grained intrusive sills and veins around the central banded and\r\namorphous masses of more coarsely crystalline material. Whether, in any\r\nof these vast domes of upheaval, the summit was disrupted, so as to\r\nallow the basic intrusion to flow out as lava at the surface, cannot\r\nnow be told, owing to enormous subsequent denudation.\r\n\r\nThe next chapter in the chronicle shows us that probably long after\r\nthe eruption of the gabbros, when possibly all outward symptom of\r\nvolcanic action had ceased, a renewed outbreak of subterranean activity\r\ngave rise to the protrusion of another and wholly different class of\r\nmaterials. This time the rocks were of a markedly acid type. They\r\nincluded varieties that range from obsidians, pitchstones, flinty\r\nfelsites and rhyolites, through porphyries and granophyres, into\r\ncompounds which cannot be classed under any other name than granite.\r\nThese masses likewise availed themselves of older vents in the\r\nplateaux, and broke through them. They now form huge conical hills,\r\nwhich, in their outer aspect, and even to some extent in their inner\r\nstructure, recall the trachytic puys of Auvergne. But the granophyres\r\nnot only ascended through the basalt-plateaux and the gabbro-bosses;\r\nthey sent into these rocks a network of veins, pushed their way in huge\r\nsheets or sills between the strata below, and actually incorporated\r\na considerable proportion of the basic materials into their own\r\nsubstance. Around the bosses of gabbro and granophyre, the bedded\r\nbasalts have undergone considerable contact-metamorphism.\r\n\r\nThe gabbro and granophyre bosses of the Inner Hebrides demonstrate with\r\nsingular force how unreliable petrographical characters are as a test\r\nof the relative age of rocks. No one, looking at hand-specimens of\r\nthese rocks, or even studying them in the field, would at first suspect\r\nthem to be of Tertiary date. They closely resemble rocks of similar\r\nkinds in Palæozoic and even Archæan formations. Yet, of their late\r\nappearance in geological time, there cannot be any possibility of doubt.\r\n\r\nAfter the uprise of the granophyre, and the injection of the network\r\nof felsitic veins, there came once more a period of terrestrial\r\nconvulsion, like that of the earliest basic dykes, but of less\r\nintensity. Again, the crust of the earth over the volcanic region was\r\npushed upward and rent open by another system of parallel fissures.\r\nAgain, from a reservoir or basin of basic lava underneath, molten rock\r\nwas forced upwards into the rents, and thus another system of basic\r\ndykes was formed. These dykes are found crossing those of earlier\r\ndate, and rising through the other volcanic rocks. They traverse the\r\nplateau-basalts from bottom to top; they climb to the summits of the\r\ngabbro mountains, and they even pursue their undeviating course over\r\nthe huge domes of granophyre. No proof has yet been found that from any\r\nof these dykes there was a superficial outflow of lava. But so great\r\nhas been the subsequent denudation of the areas, that such outflows\r\nmight quite well have taken place, and have subsequently been destroyed.\r\n\r\nWhether these basic dykes were the last manifestation of volcanic\r\nenergy in our region cannot yet be decidedly affirmed. So far as the\r\nevidence at present goes, they are possibly older than another series\r\nof acid veins and dykes (pitchstone, felsite, and granophyre), which\r\nare found at many points from Antrim to the far end of the Inner\r\nHebrides. These protrusions traverse every other member of the volcanic\r\nseries, except some of the youngest basic dykes, and do not appear to\r\nbe themselves cut by any.\r\n\r\nSince the close of the volcanic period considerable disturbance of\r\nthe basalt-plateaux has taken place. The whole volcanic region has\r\nsubsided, some districts having sunk more than others. In Britain the\r\nmost striking evidence of such depression is supplied by the basin\r\nof Lough Neagh. But throughout the Inner Hebrides much of the lower\r\nportion of the terrestrial lava-plateaux is now below sea-level. In the\r\nFaroe Islands and in Iceland the subsidence has been still more marked.\r\nDislocations, also, sometimes amounting to more than a thousand feet\r\nof displacement, have occurred among the volcanic masses. The bedded\r\nbasalts, originally on the whole nearly flat, have thus been broken up\r\ninto large blocks of country wherein the sheets are now inclined in\r\nvarious directions.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important lessons taught by the Tertiary volcanic\r\nseries of the north-west of Europe is the extent of the denudation of\r\nthe land since the close of the volcanic period. The horizontal or\r\ngently inclined layers of bedding among the basalts afford datum-lines\r\nfrom which the minimum amount of material removed may be measured. As\r\na reasonable estimate it may be inferred that in the case of the Mull\r\nplateau, for example, the average amount by which its surface has been\r\nlowered since the close of the volcanic period cannot be less than 2000\r\nfeet. If the rate of lowering of the land-surface in western Europe\r\nby subærial denudation be taken as 1/6000 of a foot in a year, then\r\nthe lapse of time required for the degradation of the Mull plateau\r\nmust amount to about twelve millions of years. Some such interval has\r\ntherefore elapsed since the last Tertiary volcanoes became extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LI\r\n\r\n                    SUMMARY AND GENERAL DEDUCTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing chapters comprise a connected narrative of the history\r\nof volcanic action in the area of the British Isles during the vast\r\nsuccession of ages from the early Archæan dawn down to the latest\r\neruptions of Tertiary time. In this final chapter I propose to present\r\na brief summary of the facts of largest import and widest interest\r\nwhich this protracted history has placed before us, together with a\r\nstatement of deductions which may be drawn from them regarding the\r\nnature and progress of volcanism in the evolution of the globe.\r\n\r\n1. Among the broad features which soonest arrest attention in such a\r\nsurvey is the geographical position of the theatre of this volcanic\r\nactivity. In the distribution of volcanoes at the present time we are\r\nfamiliar with their tendency to range themselves along continental\r\nborders or in oceanic islands. The volcanic energy so conspicuous in\r\nthe geological history of Britain has shown itself along the western\r\nor Atlantic margin of the European continent. When the eruptions have\r\nnot been actually on the land itself, they have taken place within\r\nthe shallow tracts near the land, where the lavas and tuffs have been\r\ninterstratified with sediments derived from the adjacent coasts.\r\n\r\nMoreover the volcanic rocks in Britain are ranged along the greatest\r\nlength of the group of islands, in a general north and south line, from\r\nthe south of Devonshire to the far Shetlands. It is on the western\r\nside of the country that they occur. East of a line drawn from Berwick\r\nby Leicester to Exeter, although the geological formations, ranging\r\nfrom the Carboniferous Limestone to the latest Pleistocene deposits,\r\nare there abundantly exposed to view, they include no contemporaneous\r\nvolcanic rocks.\r\n\r\n2. A second and still more remarkable feature in the geological history\r\nof Western Europe is the persistence of volcanic activity along the\r\nsite of the British Isles. Evidence has been brought forward in these\r\nvolumes that from the primeval time vaguely termed Archæan, onward\r\nto that of the older Tertiary clays and sands of the south-east of\r\nEngland--that is to say, through by far the largest part of geological\r\nhistory, as chronicled in the stratified crust of the globe--this\r\nlong strip of territory continued to be intermittently a theatre of\r\nvolcanic action. Every great division of Palæozoic time was marked by\r\nvolcanic eruptions, sometimes over tracts hundreds of square miles in\r\narea and on a colossal scale. After a long period of quiescence during\r\nthe Mesozoic ages, the renewed outbreak of volcanic energy in older\r\nTertiary time, so marked over the western half of Europe, reached its\r\nmaximum of development along the Atlantic border, from the north of\r\nEngland and Ireland through the chain of the Inner Hebrides to the\r\nFaroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland.\r\n\r\n3. Not only has there been a remarkable persistence of volcanic\r\nactivity over the comparatively limited area of the British Isles,\r\nviewed as a whole, but if we examine the different parts of this area\r\nwe perceive that many of them, of relatively restricted extent, have\r\nbeen the sites of a recrudescence of volcanic action, again and again,\r\nthrough a vast succession of geological periods. While the whole region\r\nhas been in different quarters and at different times affected, there\r\nhave been districts where the volcanic fires have been rekindled after\r\nlong intervals of quiescence, the new vents being opened among or near\r\nto the sites of earlier volcanoes. In the south-west of England, for\r\nexample, the Middle Devonian tuffs and diabases were succeeded in the\r\nCarboniferous period by the eruptions of the Culm-measures, and in the\r\nvery same tracts came last of all the lavas and tuffs of the Permian\r\nconglomerates. Still more astonishing is the record of volcanic energy\r\nin the south of Scotland, where, within a space of not many hundred\r\nsquare miles, there are the chronicles of the Arenig, Llandeilo and\r\nBala eruptions of the Southern Uplands, the huge piles of lavas and\r\ntuffs of the Lower Old Red Sandstone, the long succession of the\r\nplateaux and then of the puys of the Carboniferous period, the groups\r\nof tuff-cones of the Permian period, and, lastly, the numerous dykes\r\nconnected with the Tertiary volcanoes.\r\n\r\nWhile some portions of the region have been specially liable to\r\nexhibitions of volcanic action, others have continuously escaped. Some\r\nof these \"horsts,\" or stationary and unaffected blocks of country, have\r\nbeen surrounded by or have risen close to the borders of this volcanic\r\ndistrict, yet have maintained their immunity through a long series of\r\nages. Thus the Central Highlands of Scotland, though they were flanked\r\non the south and south-west by the active volcanoes of the Old Red\r\nSandstone, and again on the south by those of Carboniferous time,\r\nhad no vents opened on their surface after the metamorphism of their\r\nschists. Still more striking perhaps is the immunity of the Southern\r\nUplands. Though they were in large measure surrounded by the volcanoes\r\nof the Lower Old Red Sandstone, then by those of the Calciferous\r\nSandstones and Carboniferous Limestone, and though they looked down on\r\nthe Permian eruptions of Ayrshire and Nithsdale, which spread streams\r\nof lava and showers of ash along their flanks, these hills formed a\r\nsolid block that seems to have resisted perforation by the volcanic\r\nfunnels. Again, the tracts covered with Carboniferous Limestone in\r\nEngland and Ireland almost entirely escaped from invasion by volcanic\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\nWe thus learn that even within comparatively restricted regions some\r\nportions of the terrestrial crust have been areas of weakness, liable\r\nto serve again and again as lines of escape for volcanic energy, while\r\nclose to them other portions of greater solidity have been persistently\r\nleft intact.\r\n\r\n4. The sites of volcanic vents in all the geological systems wherein\r\nthey occur in Britain have not usually been determined by any obvious\r\nstructure in the rocks now visible. They comparatively seldom depend\r\non ascertainable lines of fault, even when faults, probably already\r\nexistent, occur in their near neighbourhood. This independence, to\r\nwhich, however, there are occasional marked exceptions, comes out more\r\nparticularly in the coal-fields pierced by vents, for mining operations\r\nhave there revealed the positions of many more faults than can be\r\ntraced at the surface. If the sites of the vents have been fixed by\r\ndislocations or lines of weakness in the terrestrial crust, these must\r\ngenerally lie below the formations now visible at the surface.\r\n\r\nThere is one striking connection between the sites of the vents and\r\nancient topographical features to which frequent reference has been\r\nmade in the foregoing chapters. All through the long volcanic history,\r\nas far back as such features can be traced, we see that orifices of\r\ndischarge for the erupted materials have been opened along low grounds\r\nand valleys rather than on ridges and hills. The great central hollow\r\nof the Scottish midlands was a depression even as long ago as the time\r\nof the Lower Old Red Sandstone, and though it has probably been several\r\ntimes since then filled up, and more or less completely effaced, its\r\nancient features have been partially revealed by extensive denudation.\r\nThis vast depression, 40 miles broad, between the Highland mountains\r\non the one side and the Southern Uplands on the other, was the chief\r\ncentre of volcanic activity in western Europe during the latter half of\r\nPalæozoic time. The vents of the Old Red Sandstone, Carboniferous and\r\nPermian series are scattered all over it, but few or none of them are\r\nto be found on the high grounds that bound it. Again, in Tertiary time,\r\nthe great outpouring of lava took place in the hollow that lay between\r\nthe ridge of the Outer Hebrides and the mainland of Scotland. This wide\r\nand long tract of low ground was buried under upwards of 3000 feet of\r\nlava and tuff, but these materials were erupted from fissures and vents\r\nwithin its own border and not from the mountains on either side.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most conspicuous example of any in which the vents keep\r\nto the valleys is that supplied by the Permian necks of Nithsdale and\r\nthe neighbouring glens. These depressions are as old as Permian, and\r\neven as Carboniferous time, but they appear to be entirely hollows of\r\nerosion; at least they have yielded no evidence that their direction\r\nhas been determined by lines of fault. The chain of vents can be\r\nfollowed from the lowlands of Ayrshire up to the base of the Southern\r\nUplands, down the wide valley cut by the Nith in these hills and up\r\nsome of the tributary valleys, and though the volcanoes continued for\r\nsome time in vigorous eruption, not a trace of any contemporary vent\r\nhas yet been met with on the surrounding hills.\r\n\r\nWhile the position of volcanic vents in lines of valley may be\r\ngenerally due to guiding lines of fissure in the crust underneath,\r\neither within or below the rocks visible at the surface, there may\r\nsometimes be conditions in which other dominant causes come into play.\r\nThe curious coincidence between variations in the upper limit of\r\ndykes and inequalities in the configuration of the overlying ground,\r\nsuggest that where the subterranean magma has ascended to within a\r\ncomparatively short distance from the surface, a difference of a few\r\nhundreds or thousands of feet in the depth of overlying rock, such as\r\nthe difference of height between the bottom of a valley and the tops\r\nof the adjacent hills, may determine the path of escape for the magma\r\nthrough the least thickness of overarching roof.\r\n\r\n5. Volcanic phenomena cannot be regarded as a mere isolated and\r\nincidental feature in the physics of the globe. During the short\r\ntime within which man has been observing the operations of existing\r\nvolcanoes, he has hardly yet had sufficient opportunity of watching\r\nhow far they can be correlated with other terrestrial movements. Nor,\r\nwhen he endeavours to trace some such connection among the records of\r\nthe geological past, has he yet collected materials enough to furnish\r\na sufficiently broad and firm basis of comparison. One formidable\r\nobstacle is presented by the difficulty in determining chronological\r\nequivalents in separated groups of rock. Geologists have tried to\r\ndiscover whether the volcanoes of some particular period or region\r\nwere in any way connected with such geological changes as extensive\r\nplication, dislocations of the crust, or elevation of mountain-chains.\r\nIn regard to the volcanic history of Britain, various possible\r\nrelations of this kind obviously suggest themselves. Thus the division\r\nof geological time comprised within the Lower Silurian period was\r\nundoubtedly an interval of considerable terrestrial disturbance in\r\nwestern Europe. The unconformabilities and overlaps in the series\r\nof formations belonging to that period, the frequent conglomerates,\r\nthe great and often rapid changes in the thickness and lithological\r\ncharacters of the strata, all point to instability of land-surface and\r\nsea-floor. During these oscillations a prolonged and widespread series\r\nof volcanic eruptions took place. The volcanic manifestations began\r\nin Cambrian time and continued in intermittent activity till towards\r\nthe close of the deposition of the Lower Silurian formations. It is\r\ncertainly a significant fact that the Upper Silurian deposits, in\r\ntheir lithological characters, present a strong contrast to those that\r\npreceded them. They point, on the whole, to quiet sedimentation, during\r\nan interval of comparative calm in the terrestrial crust. With this\r\nevidence of tranquillity there is, over almost the whole of the British\r\nIsles, an entire absence of any trace of renewed volcanic activity.\r\nWith the exception of the Dingle lavas and tuffs, in the extreme west\r\nof Ireland, not a single undoubted instance is yet known of an Upper\r\nSilurian volcano.\r\n\r\nAfter the deposition of the Upper Silurian rocks an interval of great\r\nterrestrial disturbance ensued, and these rocks over a large part of\r\nBritain were intensely plicated and crushed. The movements, continued\r\ninto the period of the Lower Old Red Sandstone, were, in their later\r\nstages, accompanied or, at least, followed by the vast outpourings of\r\nlava which now cover so much of the tracts of Old Red Sandstone in\r\nScotland and Ireland.[438]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 438: _Trans. Geol. Soc. Edin._ vol. ii. part iii. (1874).]\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the volcanic energy was vigorous, widespread and\r\nlong-continued, we may expect it to have been connected with important\r\nterrestrial movements affecting extensive regions of the earth. The\r\nTertiary volcanic history seems to afford a remarkable instance of this\r\nconnection. A wide area of the European continent is dotted over with\r\nold centres of volcanic activity which were in eruption at successive\r\nepochs throughout the Tertiary period. Of all these centres the most\r\nimportant was that of the north-western basalt-plateaux, where floods\r\nof lava were discharged over many thousand square miles from Ireland\r\nto Greenland. The geological date of these outpourings probably\r\ncoincides with the last great orographic movements that gave to the\r\nmountain-chains of Europe their latest elevation and dimensions.\r\n\r\nBut without entering into what must be for the present a field of\r\nspeculation, we can be assured of one important fact in the connection\r\nof ancient volcanoes with movements of the terrestrial crust. A study\r\nof the records of volcanic action in Britain proves beyond dispute that\r\nthe volcanoes of past time have been active on areas of the earth's\r\nsurface that were sinking and not rising. We usually associate volcanic\r\naction with elevation rather than subsidence, and there are certainly\r\nabundant proofs of such elevation around active or recently extinct\r\nvolcanoes. Many of the active vents of the present time, like Vesuvius\r\nand Etna, began with submarine eruptions and have been gradually\r\nupraised into land. It may be, however, that such uprise is merely a\r\ntemporary incident, and that if we could survey the whole geological\r\nperiod of which human history chronicles so small a part, we might find\r\nthat subsidence, and not upheaval, is ultimately the rule over volcanic\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, there can be no question that with the one solitary\r\nexception of the Tertiary volcanoes, which were terrestrial and not\r\nsubmarine, all the British vents were carried down and eventually\r\nburied under aqueous sediments. Even the Tertiary lava-fields have in\r\nmany places sunk down below sea-level since their eruptions ceased.\r\n\r\nThat there are any Palæozoic volcanic rocks now visible at the surface\r\nis obviously due to subsequent movements not immediately connected with\r\ntheir original conditions of eruption, and to gigantic denudation. The\r\namount of subsidence which followed on a volcanic episode was sometimes\r\nenormous, even within the same geological period, as one may see by\r\nobserving the prodigious piles of sedimentary material heaped over\r\nthe lavas and tuffs of Arenig time, or over those of the Lower Old\r\nRed Sandstone. I do not wish to maintain that the downward movement\r\nwas necessarily a consequence of volcanic ejections, for we know that\r\nit took place over tracts remote from centres of eruption. But I have\r\nsometimes asked myself whether it was not possibly increased as a\r\nsequel to vigorous volcanic action; whether, for instance, the great\r\ndepth of the Palæozoic sedimentary rocks in some regions, as compared\r\nwith their feeble development in others, may not have been due to an\r\nacceleration of subsidence consequent upon volcanic action.\r\n\r\n6. A review of the geological history of Britain cannot but impress the\r\ngeologist with a conviction of the essential uniformity of volcanism\r\nin its manifestations since the early beginnings of geological time.\r\nThe composition and structure of the materials erupted from the\r\ninterior have remained with but little change. The manner in which\r\nthese materials have been discharged has likewise persisted from the\r\nremotest periods. The three modern types of Vesuvian cones, puys and\r\nfissure-eruptions can be seen to have played their parts in the past as\r\nthey do to-day.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest igneous masses of which the relative geological\r\ndate can be fixed are the dykes which form so striking a system among\r\nthe Archæan rocks of the north-west, and show how far back the modern\r\ntype of volcanic fissures and dykes can be traced. No relic, indeed,\r\nhas survived of any lavas that may have flowed out from these ancient\r\nfissures, but so far as regards underground structure, the type is\r\nessentially the same as that of the Tertiary and modern Icelandic\r\nlava-fields.\r\n\r\nThe early Palæozoic volcanoes formed cones of lava and tuff comparable\r\nto those of such vents as Vesuvius and Etna. In the Lake District the\r\npile of material ejected during Lower Silurian time was at least 8000\r\nor 9000 feet thick. In the Old Red Sandstone basins of Central Scotland\r\nthere were more than one mass of lavas and tuffs thicker than those of\r\nVesuvius.\r\n\r\nThe puys of the later half of Palæozoic time closely resembled their\r\nTertiary successors in Central France, the Eifel, and the Phlegræan\r\nFields.\r\n\r\nNor, as regards extent and vigour, did the eruptions of the geological\r\npast differ in any important respect from those of the present time.\r\nThere is assuredly no evidence that volcanic energy has gradually\r\nwaned since the dawn of geological history. The latest eruptions\r\nof North-Western Europe, forming the Tertiary basalt-plateaux, far\r\nexceeded in area, and possibly also in bulk of material discharged, all\r\nthe eruptions that had preceded them in the geological record.\r\n\r\n7. Nevertheless, while the Tertiary eruptions showed no diminution\r\nof vigour, it is undoubtedly true that the volcanic energy has not\r\nmanifested itself in a uniform way since the beginning of geological\r\ntime. There have been periods of maximum activity followed by others of\r\nlessened force. Thus if we take a broad view of the general features\r\nof volcanic action during the Palæozoic ages in Britain, we see\r\nclear evidence of a gradual diminution in its vigour. The widespread\r\noutpourings of lava and tuff in the Silurian period in England, Wales,\r\nScotland and Ireland were succeeded by the somewhat diminished,\r\nthough still important, eruptions of the Lower Old Red Sandstone\r\nbasins. The latter were followed by the still lessened outflows of\r\nthe Carboniferous plateaux, which in turn were succeeded by the yet\r\nfeebler and more localized eruptions of the Carboniferous puys, the\r\nwhole prolonged volcanic succession ending in the small scattered vents\r\nof the Permian period. There were of course oscillations of relative\r\nenergy during this history, some of the maxima and minima being of\r\nconsiderable moment. But though progress towards extinction was not\r\nregular and uniform, it was a dominant feature of the phenomena.\r\n\r\n8. The Permian volcanoes were the last of the long Palæozoic series,\r\nand, so far as we yet know, the whole of the Mesozoic periods within\r\nthe area of Britain were absolutely unbroken by a single volcanic\r\neruption. The chronological value of this enormous interval of\r\nquiescence may, perhaps, never be ascertainable, but the interval\r\nmust assuredly cover a large part of geological time. It was an\r\nera of geological calm, during which the Triassic, Jurassic and\r\nCretaceous formations were slowly accumulated over the larger part\r\nof Europe. The stratigraphical quietude was not indeed unbroken. The\r\nwidespread subsidence of the sea-bottom was interrupted here and\r\nthere by important upheavals, and considerable geographical changes\r\nwere in process of time accomplished. But, save in one or two widely\r\nseparated areas of Europe, there were no active volcanoes over the\r\nwhole continent.[439] Here again the scarcity or absence of intercalated\r\nvolcanic rocks is in harmony with the general stratigraphy of the\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 439: The Triassic eruptions of Predazzo and Monzoni were\r\nimportant, and traces of others are said to occur in the Cretaceous\r\nsystem in Portugal and Silesia.]\r\n\r\n9. After the prodigious interval represented by the whole of the\r\nMesozoic and the earlier part of the Tertiary formations, a time\r\nof disturbance arose once more, and the great basalt-floods of the\r\nnorth-west were poured forth. Evidence has been adduced in the\r\nforegoing chapters that this latest volcanic period was one of vast\r\nduration; that it was marked by long intervals of quiescence, and by\r\nrepeated renewals of volcanic energy. Yet over the area of Britain the\r\nwhole of its manifestations were probably comprised within the earlier\r\n(Oligocene and perhaps early Miocene) part of older Tertiary time.\r\nSince its eruptions ceased, another interval of profound quiescence has\r\nsucceeded, which still continues. But this interval is almost certainly\r\nof less duration than that which elapsed between the Palæozoic and\r\nTertiary outbursts. In other words, remote as the date of these\r\nTertiary volcanoes appears to be from our own day, it comes much nearer\r\nto us than did the era of the last Permian eruptions to the earliest of\r\nthe Tertiary series.\r\n\r\n10. By the dissection which prolonged denudation has effected among the\r\nold volcanic centres of Britain, materials are supplied for studying\r\nthe sequence of events from the beginning to the end of a volcanic\r\nperiod. These events have generally followed the same tolerably\r\nwell-defined order.\r\n\r\nIn the case of fissure-eruptions, rents formed in the crust of the\r\nearth and communicating with the surface have allowed lava to rise and\r\nflow out above ground, either from the lips of the fissures or from\r\nvents opened along the lines of chasm. The thousands of parallel dykes\r\nin Britain remain as evidence of this mode of the ascent of the molten\r\nmagma. Lines of large cones of the Vesuvian type may be presumed to\r\nhave risen along guiding fissures in the terrestrial crust.\r\n\r\nBut it is evident from a study of the British examples that the\r\nexistence of a fissure in the visible part of the crust is not always\r\nnecessary for the production of a volcanic vent. In hundreds of\r\ninstances, communication from the internal magma to the surface was\r\neffected by successive explosions, which finally blew out an orifice\r\nat the surface with no visible relation to any fissures or dykes. Of\r\ncourse, beneath the formations that now form the surface, and through\r\nwhich the necks rise, there may be lines of fault or weakness in older\r\nrocks which we cannot see. But, in what can be actually examined, vents\r\nhave commonly been drilled through rocks independently of faults.\r\n\r\nThe discharge of explosive vapours was sometimes the first and only\r\neffort of volcanic energy. Generally, however, fragmentary volcanic\r\nmaterials were ejected, or, if the eruption was more vigorous, lava was\r\npoured out. In a vast number of cases, especially in the later ages\r\nof Palæozoic time, only ashes were projected, and cones of tuff were\r\nformed. In the earlier ages, on the other hand, there was a much larger\r\nproportion of lava expelled. Towards the close of a volcanic period,\r\nthe vents were gradually choked up with the fragmentary materials\r\nthat were ejected from and fell back into them. Occasionally, during\r\nthe process of extinction, an explosion might still occur and clear\r\nthe chimney, so as to allow of the uprise of a column of molten rock\r\nwhich solidified there; or the sides of the crater, as well as of the\r\ncavernous funnel underneath, fell in and filled up the passage. Heated\r\nvapours sometimes continued to ascend through the debris in the vent,\r\nand to produce on it a marked metamorphism.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been commonly a contraction and subsidence of the\r\nmaterials in the vents, with a consequent dragging down or sagging of\r\nthe rocks immediately outside, which are thus made to plunge steeply\r\ntowards the necks.\r\n\r\nWhen the vents were plugged up by the consolidation of fragmentary\r\nmatter or the uprise of lava in them, the final efforts of the\r\nvolcanoes led to the intrusion of sills and dykes, not only into the\r\nrocks beneath the volcanic sheets, but also, in many instances, into\r\nat least the older parts of the sheets themselves. These subterranean\r\nmanifestations of volcanic action may be recognized in almost every\r\ndistrict. They vary greatly in the degree to which they are developed.\r\nSometimes, as in the Cader Idris, Arenig and Snowdon regions, they\r\nattain considerable importance, alike as regards the number and\r\nthickness of the sheets. In other cases, they are exhibited on so\r\nsmall a scale that they might be overlooked, as in the tract of\r\nCarboniferous puy-eruptions in the north of Ayrshire. But they are so\r\ngenerally present as to form a remarkably characteristic feature of\r\nthe volcanic activity of each geological period from the earliest time\r\nto the latest. The basic sheets in the Dalradian series of Scotland\r\ndisplay early and colossal examples. All through the successive\r\neruptive periods of Palæozoic time, sills are found as accompaniments\r\nof superficial ejections.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary basalt-plateaux supply numerous and gigantic examples\r\nof intruded sheets. Tertiary cones of Vesuvian type are not found in\r\nBritain, but where on the continent they have been sufficiently laid\r\nopen by denudation, they present sometimes an astonishing series of\r\nsills. As a striking illustration of this structure reference may be\r\nmade to the sheets of trachyte that have been injected between and\r\nhave marmorized the Cretaceous strata on which Monte Venda stands,\r\namong the Euganean Hills.[440]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 440: G. vom Rath, _Zeitsch. Deutsch. Geol. Gesellsch._, xvi.\r\n(1864), p. 461. E. Suess, _Sitzungsber. k. Akad. Wien._, lxxi. (1875),\r\np. 7; _Antlitz der Erde_, vol. i. p. 193. E. Reyer, _Die Euganeen_,\r\n1877. This volcano is further referred to, _postea_, p. 477.]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the time of intrusion of the sills cannot be\r\nprecisely determined. They were not likely to be injected at an epoch\r\nwhen the volcanic magma could find ready egress to the surface. That\r\nthey did not arise before such egress was obtained may be inferred\r\nfrom their petrographical characters, which are usually those of the\r\nlater and not of the earlier outflows of the magma; and from the fact\r\nthat they not only lie among the rocks below the volcanic series, but\r\nintersect the lower parts of that series, sometimes even the higher\r\nparts. We may therefore, with every probability, regard the sills as\r\namong the closing phases of a volcanic period.\r\n\r\nAs the lavas and tuffs of each volcanic period are intercalated among\r\nthe successive geological formations, a definite beginning and end to\r\nthe period are stratigraphically fixed. We see exactly where in the\r\nsedimentary series the first showers of ashes fell, and where the last\r\nmingled with the ordinary sand and mud of the sea-door. The same record\r\nshows that the volcanic accumulations were finally washed down, that\r\nthey subsided with the rest of the ground around them, and that usually\r\nthey were buried under overlying conformable sedimentary deposits. Thus\r\ncones of ashes and lava which may have been several thousand feet high\r\ncompletely disappeared.\r\n\r\n10. A consideration of the distribution of the volcanic rocks in time\r\nshows not only how singularly uniform the course of volcanic activity\r\nhas been, but that there is no evidence of the cessation of any of the\r\nbroader petrographical types during geological history. Quite as much\r\nvariety may be observed among the erupted materials of Tertiary time in\r\nBritain as among those of the early ages, when the earth was younger\r\nand its volcanic vigour might be supposed to have been greater and more\r\nvaried than it is now. The table on the following page will make these\r\nfeatures at once apparent. From this table it will be seen that while\r\nsome of the acid rocks have not always been extruded, the basic masses\r\nhave played their part in every volcanic period.\r\n\r\n11. A study of the volcanic products of a long series of eruptions\r\nwithin the same geographical region may be expected to throw light\r\non the changes that take place during the course of ages in the\r\ncharacter of the internal molten magma. In a former chapter (vol. i.\r\np. 27) reference was made to the subject of volcanic cycles and to the\r\nsequence, observed in various widely separated parts of the world,\r\namong the materials erupted from below. Allusion was likewise made\r\nin a later chapter (vol. i. p. 90) to the remarkable differences in\r\ntexture and composition noticeable within some large bodies of eruptive\r\nmaterial, and to the evidence which these differences furnish of a\r\nsegregation or differentiation among the constituents of an eruptive\r\nmass after it has been injected into its position within the crust of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nTable of the Periods of Volcanic Action in the British Isles and of the\r\nChronological Distribution of the Volcanic Products.\r\n\r\n           Key to Columns\r\n  ====================================\r\n  Gr = Granites, Granophyres, etc.\r\n  Fe = Felsites, Rhyolites, etc.\r\n  Da = Dacite, \"Pitchstone\" of Eigg.\r\n  Tr = Trachytes.\r\n  An = Andesites (Porphyrites).\r\n  Ga = Gabbros.\r\n  Do = Dolerites, Basalts (Diabases).\r\n  Pi = Picrites and highly basic lavas.\r\n  Tu = Tuffs, acid or basic.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n  |                    | Gr  | Fe  | Da  | Tr  | An  | Ga  | Do  | Pi  | Tu  |\r\n  +--------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n  | Older Tertiary     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |  (Plateaux, dykes, |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |  necks, bosses,    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |  sills)            |  *  |  *  |  *  |  *  |  *  |  *  |  *  |   * |  *  |\r\n  |                    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  | Mesozoic           |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |  No volcanic rocks.|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |                    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  | Permian            | ··· |  *  | ··· | ··· |  *  | ··· |  *  |   * |  *  |\r\n  |                    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  | Carboniferous      |  ?  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |  Puy type          | ··· |  *  | ··· | ··· |  *  | ··· |  *  |   * |  *  |\r\n  |  Plateau type      | ··· |  *  | ··· |  *  |  *  | ··· |  *  |   * |  *  |\r\n  |                    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |{Devonian           | ··· | ··· | ··· | ··· | ··· | ··· |  *  |  ···|  *  |\r\n  |{                   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |{Old Red Sandstone  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |{ Upper             | ··· | ··· | ··· | ··· | ··· | ··· |  *  |  ···|  *  |\r\n  |{ Lower             |  *  |  *  | ··· |  *  |  *  | ··· |  *  |  ···|  *  |\r\n  |                    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  | Silurian           |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |  Upper             | ··· |  *  | ··· | ··· | ··· | ··· | ··· |  ···|  *  |\r\n  |  Lower, Bala       |  *  |  *  | ··· |  *  |  *  |  *  |  *  |   * |  *  |\r\n  |    \"    Arenig     |  *  |  *  | ··· |  *  |  *  |  *  |  *  |  ···|  *  |\r\n  |                    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  | Cambrian           | ··· |  *  | ··· | ··· |  *  | ··· |  *  |  ···|  *  |\r\n  |                    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  | Uriconian          | ··· |  *  | ··· | ··· | ··· | ··· |  *  |  ···|  *  |\r\n  |                    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  | Dalradian          | ··· | ··· | ··· | ··· | ··· | ··· |  *  |  ···|  ?  |\r\n  |                    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  | Torridonian        |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |                    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  | Lewisian           |  *  | ··· | ··· | ··· | ··· | ··· |  *  |   * | ··· |\r\n  |                    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  +--------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n\r\nFrom the history of volcanic action in the British Isles it is clear\r\nthat differentiation is effected under three distinct conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, a notable difference may be occasionally observed\r\nbetween two adjacent parts of the same mass of lava which has flowed\r\nout at the surface. Thus, in the Carboniferous picrite of Blackburn,\r\nthere has been a separation of the heavy basic constituents, which have\r\nin great part settled down into the lower part of the sheet, while the\r\nlighter felspar has mainly come to the top. In this case the gradual\r\ntransition from top to bottom suggests that the separation occurred\r\nafter the lava had reached the surface and taken the form of a stream\r\nor sheet.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, segregation has taken place in the magma within\r\nthe terrestrial crust after intrusion, for it is frequently observable\r\nin large bosses and sometimes in sills, the basic elements having\r\ntended to mass themselves towards the margins of the rock, leaving\r\nmore acid material in the centre. The cases of Garabol Hill among the\r\nDalradian schists of Scotland, of Carrock Fell among the Silurian\r\nstrata of the Lake District, and of the Cramond picrite among the\r\nCarboniferous formations of Midlothian, with others that might be cited\r\nfrom various other regions and geological formations in Britain, prove\r\nto what a considerable extent a separation of ingredients may take\r\nplace in a boss, and even sometimes in a comparatively thin sill before\r\nthe molten mass consolidates.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, there is good evidence that already before the\r\nmagma is either intruded or extruded, and while it still lies within\r\nthe internal reservoir, it may not possess a general uniformity of\r\ncomposition, but may have become more or less heterogeneous. In regard\r\nto intrusive rocks, the extraordinarily banded gabbros of the Tertiary\r\nseries of Skye obviously proceeded from a magma in which the molten\r\nmaterial consisted in some parts mainly of felspar, and in others\r\nmainly of the ferro-magnesian minerals and iron-ores. Streams from\r\nthese differently constituted parts of the magma were simultaneously or\r\nsuccessively injected as sills into the older portions of the volcanic\r\nseries, while, as the process of differentiation within the magma\r\nproceeded, still more felspathic liquid was left behind, to be thrust\r\ninto cracks in the sills previously consolidated.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the banded basalts of the Tertiary plateaux show that this\r\nheterogeneity was not confined to internal intrusions, but maintained\r\nits place even when the molten material was ejected to the surface.\r\nThe differentiation indeed is not so striking there as among the sills\r\nof gabbro; but its presence, even in a less degree, proves that the\r\nseparation of constituent minerals was not due to any general cooling\r\nof an erupted body of igneous rock, but was already developed in the\r\nreservoir from which the molten material was propelled to the surface.\r\n\r\nAttention has been called to the remarkable similarity of structure\r\nbetween these banded intrusive rocks and some of the ancient gneisses.\r\nThe resemblance is so close that we may with every probability infer\r\nthat the gneisses acquired their characteristic banding as intrusive\r\nmasses of igneous rocks, discharged from heterogeneous magmas, like\r\nthat which supplied the gabbros of the Cuillin Hills. And as these\r\ngneisses belong to pre-Cambrian formations, we are thus led to\r\nthe interesting result that the tendency to develop heterogeneity\r\nwas already as characteristic of the magma-basins of the earliest\r\ngeological time as it has been of those of later periods.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of differentiation presented by superficial lavas, and by\r\nintrusive sills and bosses, acquires great interest when considered\r\nin connection with the changes which are seen to have occurred in the\r\ncharacter of the materials erupted during the course of a definite\r\nvolcanic period. An attentive examination of the volcanic products of\r\nthe various ages, so fully recorded in the geological structure of the\r\nBritish Isles, shows that a recognizable sequence in the nature of the\r\nmaterials erupted during a single volcanic period can be traced from\r\nthe earliest to the latest times, and that, in spite of occasional\r\ndepartures, the normal order remains broadly uniform.\r\n\r\nWith the important exception of the Snowdonian region and possibly\r\nothers, we find that the earlier eruptions of each period were\r\ngenerally most basic, and that the later intrusions were most acid.\r\nThus the diabase-lavas and tuffs at the base of the Cambrian series of\r\nSt. David's are pierced by quartz-porphyry veins. The andesites of the\r\nLower Old Red Sandstone were succeeded by bosses, sills, and dykes of\r\ngranite, felsite, and lamprophyre. The eruptions of the Carboniferous\r\nplateaux began with extremely basic lavas, and ended with trachytes,\r\nfelsites, and quartz-porphyries. The basalts of the great lava-fields\r\nof the Tertiary period are pierced by masses of granophyre and even\r\ngranite.\r\n\r\nThere has evidently been, on the whole, a progressive diminution in\r\nthe quantity of bases and a corresponding increase in the proportion\r\nof acid in the lavas erupted during the lapse of one volcanic period.\r\nThis sequence is so well marked and so common that it cannot be merely\r\naccidental. The acid and basic rocks, occurring as they do at each\r\nvolcanic centre in the same relation to each other, are obviously parts\r\nof one connected series of eruptions. We seem to see in this sequence\r\nan indication of what was taking place within the subterranean magma.\r\nThere was first an extensive separation of the more basic constituents,\r\nsuch as the ferro-magnesian minerals and ores, and the lavas which\r\ncame off at that time were heavy and basic basalts, and even picrites.\r\nThe removal of these elements left the magma more acid, and such rocks\r\nas andesites were poured out, until at last the deeper intrusive\r\nsills, dykes and bosses became thoroughly acid rocks, such as felsite,\r\nquartz-porphyry and granite, while if any superficial outflow took\r\nplace it was such a rock as dacite.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Tertiary volcanic series there is evidence that\r\nafter the acid protrusions a final uprise of basic material occurred.\r\nNo satisfactory proof of any similar return to basic eruptions has been\r\ndetected among the Palæozoic formations. But it is possible that some\r\nof the basic sills and dykes, the precise age of which cannot be fixed,\r\nmay really mark such a reversion, even in the earlier volcanic periods.\r\n\r\nSome illustrative examples of volcanic cycles from other countries\r\nwere cited in Chapter iii. To these I may add another instance which\r\npresents a close analogy to some of the phenomena characteristic of\r\nthe British examples of Palæozoic as well as of Tertiary age. Monte\r\nVenda in the Euganean Hills, already alluded to (p. 474), may be cited\r\nas an interesting specimen of an older Tertiary volcano, which has\r\nbeen so dissected by denudation as to show not only the succession\r\nof its superficial discharges, but the position and order of its\r\nsubterranean intrusions. The volcanic eruptions of this neighbourhood,\r\njudging from the area which they still cover and the height they\r\nreach, may have piled up a mountain rivalling or surpassing Etna in\r\ndimensions. In Monte Venda the lowest visible igneous rocks are sills\r\nof oligoclase-trachyte that have been thrust between and have highly\r\naltered Cretaceous (Tithonian) limestones. Other intrusive sheets\r\nof trachyte follow in the overlying Cretaceous strata (Neocomian\r\nand _Scaglia_). It is not until the older Tertiary formations are\r\nreached that undoubted tuffs and lavas occur, indicative of truly\r\ninterstratified volcanic materials. These formations, consisting of\r\nnummulitic limestones and other strata together with fossiliferous\r\ntuffs, show that the volcano began as a submarine vent. It discharged\r\ndark basic dolerites and tuffs. The highest lava, however, crowning\r\nthe summit of the mountain is a trachyte. There appears to have been\r\na rapid decrease of the bases in the magma, for the later lavas were\r\nrhyolites, accompanied with rhyolitic tuffs of Oligocene age, and\r\nfollowed in the end by the black vitreous trachyte of Monte Sieva.\r\n\r\n12. From the evidence detailed in these volumes, it appears that the\r\nsequence from basic to acid discharges was on the whole characteristic\r\nof each eruptive period. It is obvious, however, that as the\r\nprotrusions of successive periods took place within the same limited\r\ngeographical area, the internal magma during the interval between\r\ntwo such periods must in some way have been renewed as regards its\r\nconstitution, for when, after long quiescence, eruptions began once\r\nmore, basic lavas appeared first and were eventually followed by\r\nacid kinds. This cycle of transformation is admirably exhibited in\r\nCentral Scotland, where the andesites of the Old Red Sandstone with\r\ntheir felsite sills are followed by the limburgites, picrites and\r\nother highly basic lavas at the bottom of the Carboniferous plateaux,\r\nsucceeded in turn by the andesites, trachytes and acid sills of that\r\nseries. When the puy eruptions ensued, the magma had once more become\r\ndecidedly basic.\r\n\r\nThat the true explanation of these alterations is of a complex order\r\nmay be inferred from the exceptions which occur to the general rule.\r\nI have alluded to the Snowdon region, where the acid rhyolites are\r\nfollowed by more basic andesites, and where the sills are also more\r\nbasic than the superficial lavas. In the Arenig and Cader Idris country\r\nthe sills are likewise more basic than the bedded lavas. Among the\r\nCarboniferous puys of the basin of the Firth of Forth, the sills are\r\nnot sensibly more acid than many of the superficial basalts, and they\r\neven include such rocks as picrite.

It deals with a series of animal groups, all\r\n  deeply interesting to the specialist in Morphology; some important\r\n  from their economic relations to other living things, others in\r\n  their life-histories rivalling the marvels of fairy-tales. And\r\n  the style in which they are here treated is also interesting:\r\n  history and the early observations of the older writers lend their\r\n  charm; accounts of habits, and mode of occurrence, of life, in a\r\n  word, from the cradle to the grave, are given in ample detail,\r\n  accompanied by full references to modern and current literature.\r\n  The whole is admirably illustrated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELLS.\r\n\r\nVOLUME III.\r\n\r\n  MOLLUSCS AND BRACHIOPODS.
