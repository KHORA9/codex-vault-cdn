T. ALLEN\r\n\r\nForester for the Western Forestry & Conservation Association (Formerly\r\nU. S. District Forester for Oregon, Washington and Alaska)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIssued by\r\nThe Western Forestry & Conservation Association\r\nOffice of the Forester\r\n421 Yeon Building, Portland, Oregon.\r\n1911\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nWHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT AND WHY\r\n\r\nThe object of this booklet is to present the elementary principles\r\nof forest conservation as they apply on the Pacific coast from\r\nMontana to California.\r\n\r\nThere is a keen and growing interest in this subject. Citizens of\r\nthe western states are beginning to realize that the forest is a\r\ncommunity resource and that its wasteful destruction injures their\r\nwelfare. Lumbermen are coming to regard timber land not as a mine to\r\nbe worked out and abandoned, but as a possible source of perpetual\r\nindustry. They find little available information, however, as to\r\nhow these theories can be reduced to actual practice. The Western\r\nForestry and Conservation Association believes it can render no more\r\npractical service than by being the first to outline for public\r\nuse definite workable methods of forest management applicable to\r\nwestern conditions.\r\n\r\nA publication of this length can give little more than an outline,\r\nbut attempt has been made either to answer the most obvious questions\r\nwhich suggest themselves to timber owners interested in forest\r\npreservation or to guide the latter in finding their own answers.\r\nOnly the most reliable conservative information has been drawn\r\non, much of it having been collected by the Government.\r\n\r\nWhile the booklet is intended to be of use chiefly to forest owners,\r\na chapter on the advantage to the community of a proper state forest\r\npolicy is included, also a chapter on tree growing by farmers.\r\nThe first presents the economic relation of forest preservation\r\nto public welfare, with its problems of fire prevention, taxation\r\nand reforestation; for the use of writers, legislators, voters,\r\nor others desiring to investigate this subject of growing public\r\nconcern. It is based upon the conclusions of the best unprejudiced\r\nauthorities who have approached these problems from the public\r\nstandpoint.\r\n\r\nIn the technical chapters on forest management and its possibilities,\r\nthe author accepts full responsibility for conclusions drawn except\r\nwhen otherwise noted. To the Forest Service, however, is entitled the\r\ncredit for collecting practically all the growth and yield figures\r\nupon which these conclusions are based. Especial acknowledgement\r\nis due to Mr. J. F. Kümmel for information on tree planting.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this preface, the author regrets that the booklet\r\nwhich it introduces was necessarily written hurriedly, a page or\r\ntwo at a time, at odd hours taken from the work of a busy office.\r\nFor this reason its style and management leaves much to be desired,\r\nbut it has been thought better to make the information it contains\r\nimmediately available than to await a doubtful opportunity to rewrite\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nWhat This Book Is About, and Why.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nWhat We Have in the West.

It means also that here lies the most promising field of\r\nproduction for all time. The wonderful density and extent of our\r\nWestern forests are not accidental, but result because climatic\r\nand other conditions are the most favorable in the world for forest\r\ngrowth. In just the degree that they excel forests elsewhere is\r\nit easier to make them continue to do so.\r\n\r\nWHAT WE ARE DOING WITH IT\r\n\r\n_On the other hand, forest fires in Montana, Idaho, Washington,\r\nOregon and California destroy annually, on an average, timber which\r\nif used instead of destroyed would bring forty million dollars to\r\ntheir inhabitants, Idleness of burned and cut-over land represents\r\na direct loss almost as great._\r\n\r\nThese are actual money losses to the community. So is the failure of\r\nrevenue through the destruction of a tax resource. Equally important,\r\nand hardly less direct, is the injury to agricultural and industrial\r\nproductiveness which depends upon a sustained supply of wood and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nDOES IT PAY?\r\n\r\nPractically all this loss is unnecessary. Other countries have\r\nstopped the forest fire evil. Other countries have found a way\r\nto make forest land continue to grow forest. Consequently we can.\r\nIt is clearly only a question of whether it is worth while. Let us\r\nconsider this question, not only in its relation to posterity or\r\nto the lumberman, but from the standpoint of the average citizen\r\nof the West today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nFORESTRY AND THE PUBLIC\r\n\r\nTIMBER MEANS PAY CHECKS\r\n\r\n_Forest wealth is community wealth._ The public's interest in it\r\nis affected very little by the passage of timber lands into private\r\nownership, for all the owner can get out of them is the stumpage\r\nvalue. The people get everything else. Our forests earn nothing\r\nexcept by being cut and shipped to the markets of the world. Of the\r\nprice received for them usually much less than a fifth is received\r\nby the owner. Nearly all goes to pay for labor and supplies here\r\nat home.\r\n\r\n_Even now, when the western lumber industry is insignificant compared\r\nto what it will be soon, it brings over $125,000,000 a year into\r\nthese five states._ This immense revenue flows through every artery\r\nof labor, commerce and agriculture; in the open farming countries as\r\nwell as in the timbered districts. It is shared alike by laborer,\r\nfarmer, merchant, artisan and professional man. It is their greatest\r\nsource of income, for lumber is the chief product which, being\r\nsold elsewhere, actually brings in outside money.\r\n\r\nThat it is essential to the prosperity of every citizen to have\r\nthis contribution to his livelihood continue requires no argument.\r\nFrom the manufacturing point of view alone, our forest resources\r\nare as important to everyone of us as to the lumberman, and in many\r\nways more so, for if they are exhausted he can move or change his\r\nbusiness; while the dependent industries cannot. But our welfare\r\nis at stake in a dozen other ways also.\r\n\r\nOUR INTEREST AS CONSUMERS\r\n\r\nEvery person who uses wood, whether to build, fence, burn, box\r\nhis goods, or timber his mine, is directly interested in a cheap\r\nand plentiful supply of timber. _Every acre burned, every cut-over\r\nacre lying idle, raises the price for him without furnishing any\r\nrevenue with which to help pay it. Every acre saved from fire,\r\nevery acre of young growth, lowers it for him and puts money in\r\ncirculation besides._\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the cost to the consumer of most articles of every day\r\nnecessity is directly affected by the connection of forest material\r\nwith their production. Wood and water are almost as essential to\r\nmining as are, hence influence the price of metals. In the form\r\nof fuel, buildings, or boxes, if not as an actual constituent of\r\nthe product itself, wood supply bears a like relation to almost\r\nevery industry.\r\n\r\nEvery reduction of the lumber traffic which helps support our railroads,\r\nor of their supply of poles, ties and car material, tends to raise\r\nthe cost of our groceries and other rail-transported commodities.\r\n\r\nSCHOOL LANDS\r\n\r\nMost of our western states have immense areas of forested grant\r\nlands, the sale of timber from which supports the public schools and\r\nother state institutions. Destruction of this asset is a direct blow\r\nto these institutions which can be only partially met by increased\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\nTHE FARMER HAS THE MOST AT STAKE\r\n\r\nIn the case of western agriculture, the relation to the forest\r\nis fundamental and inseparable. Enough has been said to show that\r\nbecause of its importance as a sustaining industry lumber manufacture\r\nis a prodigious factor in creating a market for farm products,\r\nalso that the cost of all articles used by the farmer is cheapened\r\nby forest preservation. _But back of this lies the all-important\r\ndependence of western agriculture upon irrigation. We must save\r\nthe forests that store the waters._\r\n\r\nOf particular significance to the farmer, too, is the tremendous\r\nimportance of forests as a source of tax revenue to help support\r\nstate and county government. The cost of government is growing as\r\nour population grows. Taxable property grows mainly in the cities.\r\nElsewhere we confront the problem of diminishing timber to tax and\r\nconsequent heavier and heavier burden on farm property. _It will\r\nbe a bad situation for the farmer if the timber is all destroyed\r\nand he has to pay all the taxes, as well as a higher price for his\r\nbuildings, fences and fruit boxes. Every acre of timber burned\r\nor wasted hastens this day._\r\n\r\nThe conservation thus suggested does not mean non-use of ripe timber,\r\nbut does mean protecting it from useless waste and destruction,\r\nand replacing it by reforestation when it is used.\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS OF LIFE THE REAL ISSUE INVOLVED\r\n\r\nLack of space forbids recounting many other ways in which the forest\r\nquestion touches the average citizen. It enters into our prospects\r\nof development, our investment values and our insurance rates. Like\r\nthe keystone of an arch, or the link of a chain, forests cannot\r\nbe destroyed without the collapse of the entire fabric. Their\r\npreservation is not primarily a property question, but a principle\r\nof public economy, dealing with one of the elements of human existence\r\nand progress. _Failure to treat it as such means harder conditions\r\nof life, a handicap of industry; not only for our children, but\r\nfor us as well._\r\n\r\nIt all sums up to this: On every acre of western forest destroyed\r\nby fire, or that fails to grow where it might grow, _we, the citizens\r\nof the West who are not lumbermen, bear fully eighty per cent of\r\nthe direct loss_ and sustain serious further injury to our general\r\nsafety and profit.\r\n\r\nHOW WE THROW AWAY MILLIONS\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the above facts, we allow $40,000,000 which we and\r\nour families should share to vanish every year, leaving nothing\r\nmore enduring than a pall of smoke from Canada to the Mexican line.\r\nThe great area thus denuded uselessly, with that which produced\r\npublic wealth through lumber manufacture, _together having been\r\ncapable of affording a community resource of $165,000,000_, are\r\nabandoned to lie idle and a menace to remaining timber. It is exactly\r\nas though the owner of a 165-acre orchard should destroy forty\r\nacres wantonly and also abandon the rest, unfenced, uncultivated\r\nand uncared for.\r\n\r\nThe one waste is as unnecessary as the other. Our Pacific coast\r\nforests owe their unparalleled productiveness to a peculiarly fortunate\r\ncombination of climate and rapid growing species unknown elsewhere.\r\nNowhere else is forest reproduction so swift and certain. Nowhere\r\ncan it be secured with so little effort and expense. A little\r\nforethought in cutting methods and protection of the cut-over area\r\nfrom recurring fires, and an early second crop is assured. Saw timber\r\ncan be grown in forty to seventy-five years; ties, mine timber and\r\npiles in less.\r\n\r\nHOW WE MIGHT MAKE IMMENSE PROFIT INSTEAD.\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to suppose that, although the quality may be inferior\r\nto that of the old forest removed now, timber scarcity will make a\r\nsecond cut in sixty years equally profitable per acre. Therefore,\r\nif the area denuded annually at present were encouraged to reforest\r\nand protected, it should at the end of that period again yield\r\n$165,000,000 to the community. Each year's growth at present would\r\nbe worth a sixtieth of that sum, or $2,750,000. _If given any chance\r\nto do so, the area deforested in only ten years would actually\r\nearn the people of our five western forest states $27,500,000 a\r\nyear._\r\n\r\nAlmost nothing is being done to make it do so. As the result of\r\nthe same popular neglect, this annual loss of nearly twenty-eight\r\nmillions of dollars is added to that of forty millions caused by\r\ndestruction of merchantable timber by fire, and the injury to tax\r\nrevenue, water supply and countless dependent industries still\r\nremain to be reckoned. And to this sacrifice of wealth we add that\r\nof scores of human lives, incredible suffering, and the wiping\r\nout of homes and villages by forest fires.\r\n\r\nPLAIN WORDS FOR OUR PRESENT POLICY\r\n\r\nLet us draw a parallel: If riot or invasion should sweep our Pacific\r\ncoast states, killing unprotected settlers, plundering banks and\r\ntreasuries of $40,000,000 of the people's savings and business\r\ncapital, and by destroying the producing power of commercial enterprise\r\nreduce the community's income by twenty-eight millions more, the\r\ncatastrophe would startle the world.\r\n\r\nIf this stupendous disaster should threaten to recur the following\r\nyear and every year thereafter indefinitely, annually taking $67,000,000\r\nfrom the earnings of the people, diminishing their invested wealth\r\nand paralyzing their industries, the situation would be unbearable.\r\nIt would dominate the minds of men, women and children. All else\r\nwould be forgotten in their preparation for defense.\r\n\r\n_Forest fire destruction is a danger in every way as real and immediate\r\nas riot or invasion, equally measurable in losses to us today and\r\nmore far reaching in effect upon future prosperity. Although less\r\nsensational, it demands no less prompt action._\r\n\r\nTHE ACTION WE MUST TAKE\r\n\r\nThe foregoing facts prove that our present forest policy is unprofitable\r\nto the state and its citizens. What, then, is the remedy?\r\n\r\nAt first thought it may seem that the responsibility for this lies\r\nwith the man who controls the land, the timber owner and lumberman.\r\nHe does have his part to play, which is discussed elsewhere in\r\nthis booklet. But he will not, indeed cannot, do so until the rest\r\nof us play ours. The community must not only coöperate, but in\r\nsome directions must act first, because from the beginning the\r\nlumberman is governed by many conditions which are fixed by the\r\npeople. It is for the people to make these conditions reasonably\r\nfavorable so that he will have neither excuse nor incentive for\r\nfailing to conform to them.\r\n\r\nIn this coöperation the people should not be expected to grant\r\nprivileges which are not for their own advantage also. Nor should\r\nthey hesitate to coöperate if it is to their advantage, merely\r\nbecause it is also a help to the lumberman. It is natural that the\r\npublic should disincline to assume any further burden to enrich the\r\ntimber owner. Were this the sale object of forest protection it would\r\nbe fair to leave it to him. But it is the height of bad economy to\r\nobstruct or refuse to help him in handling forest resources to our\r\nbest advantage. Whether he gains or loses is merely incidental to\r\nus, but whether we gain or lose is of very great importance.\r\n\r\nFIRST STEP IS TO STOP FOREST FIRES\r\n\r\nObviously reduction of the forest fire hazard is the most urgent\r\nproblem. Not only is fire the greatest destroyer of existing forests,\r\nbut it also discourages investment in reforestation. The public has\r\na right to expect the lumberman to adopt every safeguard against\r\nit in his operations. Nevertheless, the first step to encourage\r\nhim in this is to reduce the appalling carelessness with fire in\r\nwhich the people of the West are the worst offenders in the world\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nForest fires are almost always unnecessary. They usually result\r\nfrom a neglect of consideration for injury and distress to others\r\nwhich is not shown by the American people in any other connection.\r\nThe traveler or resident in forest regions simply fails to realize\r\nthat his own welfare and that of countless others requires the\r\nsame precaution not to let fire escape, and the same activity in\r\nextinguishing fires he discovers, that are accorded as a matter\r\nof course in cities and towns. In reality they are more important.\r\nA San Francisco can burn down and it is soon replaced. Insurance\r\nand capital come to the rescue, labor is employed, and business\r\nis resumed. _But when the forest burns, industry dies and labor is\r\ndriven away empty handed._ It is a big price to pay for neglecting\r\nthe slight effort required to prevent it.\r\n\r\nFairly good fire laws are on our statute books. Presumably they\r\nwere intended to prevent fires. Yet almost every forest community\r\nsees fire after fire set through ignorance, carelessness or purpose,\r\nand so far from punishing the offenders accords them every privilege\r\nof business and society. In cities, however insignificant the damage,\r\narson leads to the penitentiary. A forest fire may destroy millions and\r\nthe cause not even be investigated. If, aggravated by a particularly\r\ninexcusable case of malice or carelessness, some property holder\r\n(seldom the people) secures an arrest, acquittal is practically\r\ncertain because the community considers the matter none of its\r\nbusiness. Then the value of the fire law is at an end in that region.\r\nCertainly we cannot expect the timber owner to protect our forest\r\ninterests until we ourselves respect and at least attempt to enforce\r\nour forest laws.\r\n\r\nPATROL SERVICE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL\r\n\r\nBut necessary as is better public sentiment, we must also have\r\npractical machinery for enforcing the laws and for stopping the fires\r\nthat do start. Just as a city is safeguarded best by an organized\r\nfire department, so the forest can be protected effectively only by\r\ntrained men who know the work. And the man who prevents the most\r\nfires is the man who is looking for them, not the man who goes\r\nafter the fire is under way.\r\n\r\nTheodore Roosevelt says: \"I hold as first among the tasks before\r\nthe states and the nation in their respective shares in forest\r\nconservation the organization of efficient fire patrols and the\r\nenactment of good fire laws on the part of the states.\"\r\n\r\nThe National Conservation Commission reports: \"Each state within\r\nwhose boundaries forest fires are working grave injury, and that\r\nmeans every forest state, must face the fact squarely that to keep\r\ndown forest fires needs not merely a law upon the statute books,\r\nbut an effective force of men actually on the ground to patrol\r\nagainst fire.\"\r\n\r\nWe all know that few disastrous fires start under conditions which\r\nprevent their control. Usually they spring from some of the many\r\nsmall, apparently innocent fires which burn unnoticed until wind\r\nand hot weather fan them into action. It is far cheaper to put\r\nthem out in the incipient stage than to fight them later, perhaps\r\nunsuccessfully until after great damage has been done. And if fighting\r\nis necessary, it is of the highest importance to have it led by\r\ncompetent, experienced men. Moments count, and bad judgment is\r\nexpensive.\r\n\r\nMost western states already have laws regulating the use of fire\r\nfor clearing during the dry season. To accomplish this with safety\r\nand without hardship requires fire wardens to issue permits and\r\nhelp with the burning if necessary.\r\n\r\nPublic knowledge that there is someone to enforce the law tends\r\nto restrain the dangerous class. Still more useful is the service\r\nof fire wardens in agitating the fire question and keeping before\r\nforest residents the advantage of their coöperation.\r\n\r\nCO-OPERATION WITH PRIVATE OWNERS DESIRABLE\r\n\r\nIn fire patrol, especially, the state and the lumberman must work\r\ntogether. It is reasonable that the timber owner should contribute\r\nto the protection of his property. He also has peculiar facilities\r\nfor getting the work done well and cheaply. As a rule he is willing\r\nto do his part. In 1910 the Washington Forest Fire Association and\r\nother timber owners in that state paid out $300,000 for patrol\r\nand other fire work. The Coeur d'Alene, Clearwater, Potlatch and\r\nPend d'Oreille Timber Protective associations spent over $200,000\r\nin Idaho. Oregon timbermen spent approximately $130,000. Figures\r\nare not available for Montana and California, but probably the\r\nsame proportion holds.\r\n\r\nThorough support by the state is necessary to make private work\r\neffective. The men employed must have official authority to enforce\r\nthe law. The dangerous element does not respect a movement which\r\nnominally represents only the property owner. The people in general\r\ndo not aid it as much as they do one in which they also share.\r\nTherefore, it is necessary to have state facilities for coöperating\r\nin the organization, authorization and supervision of all forest\r\npatrols.\r\n\r\nLIBERAL APPROPRIATION A GOOD INVESTMENT\r\n\r\nBut to stop here is like attempting to protect a city from fire\r\nmerely by giving its factory owners the right to maintain watchmen.\r\nWe want to provide for the greatest possible advantage to the people\r\nthrough the timber owner's desire to protect his own property,\r\nbut any forest policy which ends with this is hopelessly weak.\r\nWe cannot afford to leave any matter of public welfare wholly to\r\nthe wisdom and philanthropy of private enterprise. If we expect\r\nour paramount interest in forest and water resources to be looked\r\nout for properly, we must pay for it just as we do for all other\r\nprotection we get through organized government. Nor should we forget\r\nthat the timber owner helps us again in this, for he pays taxes\r\nas well as the cost of his private patrol.\r\n\r\nThere are also many regions where timber values do not warrant\r\npatrol, but where the safety of other property, and of life, demand\r\nboth patrol and fire fighting. Here the state owes its citizens\r\nprotection. Moreover, one of the weakest points in our present\r\nsystem everywhere is lack of police authority to apprehend violators\r\nof the fire laws. The private warden cannot successfully arrest\r\nor prosecute offenders, and everybody knows it. Most fires start\r\nthrough violation of law. To prevent them the law must be respected,\r\nand to accomplish this there must be state officers who can and\r\nwill apprehend offenders without fear or favor.\r\n\r\nAny western state can well afford to spend $100,000 a year for\r\na forest fire service which will prevent a loss of fifty times\r\nthat sum. The cost is imperceptible by the citizen, his benefit\r\nimmediate. _Forest protection is the cheapest form of prosperity\r\ninsurance a timbered state can buy._\r\n\r\nREFORESTATION\r\n\r\nAlthough it does not pay to burn up our forests, it does pay to use\r\nthem. _The faster we can replace them with new ones, the quicker\r\nthis profit can be made with safety._ Forest land is community\r\ncapital. To let it lie idle is as wasteful as destruction. And\r\nwe must also remember that the day is coming when our forested\r\nstreams must do a hundred times their present duty, and when the\r\nlumber consumer's question may not be \"What must I pay for a board?\"\r\nbut \"Can I get a board at all?\" We must have new forests coming\r\nas the old ones go.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government is practicing forestry in the lands controlled\r\nby the Forest Service. _Why should the states not do the same thing\r\nwith their school and tax deed lands? Intelligent care of timbered\r\nschool land, selling the timber only under regulations which will\r\ninsure reforestation, would realize as much today and in the long\r\nrun pay a thousand per cent in dividends for the education of our\r\nchildren and our children's children._\r\n\r\nFurther than this, there should be legislation to permit the state\r\nto solidify its forest lands by exchange, when advisable, and to\r\nauthorize the purchase of cut-over lands. The eventual profit in\r\nthis is certain to be great, and nothing will do more to interest\r\nthe public and private owners in reforestation. It is the history or\r\nall countries that forests are peculiarly profitable state property,\r\nespecially when, as is the case with us, it can be acquired cheaply.\r\nIt is a sound and well-proved policy that it is well for the state to\r\nown lands which are not adapted for permanent individual development.\r\nForest lands constitute the ideal class, not only because the state\r\nis in the best position to keep up their usefulness to the community,\r\nbut also because they will earn perpetual revenue far greater than\r\nthey could bring through taxation. They will pay back the cost and\r\ninterest, become increasingly valuable, and still pay dividends.\r\n\r\nIt is even more important that reforestation be secured on private\r\nlands, because their area is greater than that owned by state and\r\ngovernment. With the encouragement which could be given the owner\r\nwithout any undeserved concession, conditions would warrant him\r\nin securing it. We have reached that stage in our development.\r\nThe exhaustion of timber in the country at large, the increase of\r\nconsumption, and our peculiar natural advantages, have combined\r\nto promise adequate financial return. And the lumberman does not\r\nwant to go out of business unless he has to.\r\n\r\nOBSTACLES TO PRIVATE EFFORT\r\n\r\nTo insure a second crop the lumberman has to lose more or less\r\nmoney when he cuts the first. His methods must be more expensive\r\nand he must forego present profits on trees he leaves. If he plants,\r\nthe outlay is considerable. But let us suppose he is willing to\r\ndo all this, not because he is a philanthropist but because he\r\nwants more trees to run his mill some day.\r\n\r\nIt is a comparatively simple matter to get his second crop started.\r\nAmerican forestry has solved this problem fairly well. It is also\r\neasy to calculate in most cases, beginning with the sale value of\r\ncut-over land, using safe estimate of the next yield and the time\r\nrequired to mature it, and setting a conservative future stumpage\r\nvalue, that growing timber ought to be a profitable investment. If\r\nthat were all, we could leave the lumberman alone and count on\r\nhim to perpetuate our forests because it will pay him to do so.\r\n\r\nBut the whole calculation, consequently the public's interest as\r\nwell as his, is upset by two factors--the danger that his investment\r\nwill burn up and the practical certainty that taxes will eat up\r\nall profit before the harvest. If he figures on fire protection\r\nat his own expense against the hazard as it now exists, and the\r\ntax burden on cut-over land which is indicated at present, his\r\nengagement in forest growing will be negligible from the point of\r\nview of public welfare. In some cases he may hold the land awhile,\r\nin few can he afford to protect it, in still fewer is he justified\r\nin actually doing anything to insure reforestation.\r\n\r\nIf a man proposes to build a factory or railroad in a community\r\nthe inhabitants usually encourage him. They do not refuse him fire\r\nprotection in the first place and then, if his plant burns down,\r\nthreaten to burn it again and keep up full taxation on the vacant\r\nland. They offer every fair inducement to get the industry and keep\r\nit flourishing. They expect it to pay its just share of taxation,\r\nbut want it to continue to do so as long as possible.\r\n\r\nTAX NEW CROP WHEN HARVESTED\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the first obstacle to reforestation of private\r\nland can be removed only by supporting a fire patrol and creating\r\npublic sentiment which will reduce the number of fires. The second\r\nis even more wholly in the hands of the people, for by the system\r\nof taxation they impose they decide _whether it shall continue an\r\nearning power and a tax source forever or be abandoned to become\r\na desert_; non-producing, non-taxable, and a menace to stream-flow.\r\nWhether its owner has made money on the original crop has no bearing\r\non the result, nor has his being rich or poor, resident or alien.\r\nCutover land presents a distinct problem to him. He will and should\r\npay a full tax on its earning power, which will be demonstrated\r\nwhen he successfully brings another crop to maturity. But he cannot\r\ncarry an investment for fifty years or more without return, with a\r\nrisk of total loss by fire up to the last moment, at a cost which\r\nwould bring him better profit in some other business.\r\n\r\nThese facts are recognized by all students of forestry. The following\r\nauthorities hold no brief for the lumberman. They approached the\r\nsubject solely from the side of the people:\r\n\r\nTheodore Roosevelt: \"Second only to good fire laws is the enactment\r\nof tax laws which will permit the perpetuation of existing forests\r\nby use.\"\r\n\r\nNational Conservation Commission: \"Present tax laws prevent\r\nreforestation of cut-over land and the perpetuation of existing\r\nforests by use. An annual tax upon the land itself, exclusive of\r\nthe timber, and a tax upon the timber when cut is well adapted\r\nto actual conditions of forest investment and is practicable and\r\ncertain. It would insure a permanent revenue from the forest in\r\nthe aggregate far greater than is now collected, and yet be less\r\nburdensome upon the state and upon the owner. It is better from\r\nevery side that forest land should yield a moderate tax permanently\r\nthan that it should yield an excessive revenue temporarily, and\r\nthen cease to yield at all.\"\r\n\r\nH. S. Graves, Chief Forester for the U. S.: \"Private owners do\r\nnot practice forestry for one or more of three reasons: 1. The\r\nrisk of fire. 2. Burdensome taxation. 3. Low prices of products.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Fairchild, tax expert, Yale University: \"Forestry must\r\ncome some time, and its early coming is a thing greatly to be desired.\r\nWe can hardly hope to see the general practice of forestry as long\r\nas the present methods of taxation continue. With regard to its\r\neffect on revenue, there is little to be feared from the tax on\r\nyield. It is equitable and certain. _If a tax at once equitable\r\nand dependable is guaranteed, the business of forestry will not\r\nneed to ask special favors._\"\r\n\r\nCRYING NEED FOR DEFINITE STATE POLICY\r\n\r\nTo accomplish these reforms will take law-making and law-enforcing.\r\nHowever well we study existing conditions and legislate upon the\r\npremises they furnish, success depends upon competent application\r\nof the laws and their improvement as conditions change. It is a\r\nbitter reproof to us of the West that Eastern states, with forest\r\nand water resources insignificant compared to ours, have gone so\r\nmuch farther in securing the services of trained men to study these\r\nquestions and to guard both private and public interests. The very\r\nfirst step should be to get competent trained state foresters who\r\nwill devise wise measures, protect us from unwise ones, and educate\r\nlumbermen and public alike to the common need of action. We pay\r\ncheerfully for every other kind of public service, for geologists,\r\nveterinarians, insurance commissioners, barber examiners, and what\r\nnot. But the two things we must have--wood and water--we leave\r\npretty much to take care of themselves, and they aren't doing it\r\nand never will.\r\n\r\n_The essentials of a wise state forest policy, based not on theory\r\nbut on successful experience elsewhere, are as cheap as they are\r\nsimple._ Where tried they have never been abandoned. If they pay\r\nelsewhere, can we afford not to try? Following is the framework\r\nof a code demanded by the situation in every Western state. Some\r\nalready approach it, but none goes far enough:\r\n\r\nESSENTIALS OF EFFECTIVE STATE FOREST CODE\r\n\r\n1. A State Board of Forestry selected with the single view of insuring\r\nthe most competent expert judgment on the matters with which it\r\ndeals. In other words, the board should not be political, but\r\nappointment by the Governor should be restricted to responsible\r\nrepresentatives nominated by the interests most familiar with forest\r\nmanagement, such as state forest schools, lumbermen's associations,\r\nforest fire associations, conservation associations and the resident\r\nFederal forest service.\r\n\r\n2. A trained state forester, wholly independent of politics. Executive\r\nability and practical forest knowledge should be considered essential,\r\nalso scientific training. He should have one or more assistants of\r\nhis own appointing.\r\n\r\n3. A liberally supported forest fire service, in which the state\r\nforester has ample latitude in coöperation, financial and otherwise,\r\nwith all other agencies in the same work.\r\n\r\n4. A systematic study of forest conditions to afford basis of both\r\nintelligent administration and desirable further legislation.\r\n\r\n5. A system for active general popular education, with specific\r\nadvice to individuals in proper forest management.\r\n\r\n6. Application of forestry principles to the management of state-owned\r\nforest lands and the purchase of cut or burned over land better\r\nsuited for state than for private forestry. This is to furnish\r\neducative examples of conservative management as well as to maintain\r\nstate revenue and proper forest conditions.\r\n\r\n7. Improvement and strict enforcement of laws against fire and\r\ntrespass, with penalty for neglect to enforce them by any officer\r\nwho is paid to do so.\r\n\r\n8. Encouragement of reforestation by assessing deforested land\r\nannually on land value only, deferring taxation of forest growth\r\nuntil its cutting furnishes income with which to meet the tax.\r\n\r\n9. Thorough study of the subject of taxing standing timber, to\r\nthe end of securing a system which, by insuring a fair revenue\r\nwithout enforcing bad forest management, will result in the greatest\r\ncommunity good.\r\n\r\nDO IT NOW\r\n\r\n_You, the average citizen of the West, are responsible for the\r\npresent situation and for its remedy._ Merely to agree that it is\r\nunfortunate, and virtuously to condemn firebugs, careless lumbermen\r\nand indifferent legislators, does not relieve you of the responsibility.\r\nNeither will it protect you from the consequences. On the other hand,\r\nthe firebug will not fire if he knows it will not be tolerated. The\r\nlumberman will adopt protective methods if you encourage him. The\r\nlegislator is glad to help in any way his constituents suggest.\r\n_They are all only waiting for a word from you, whose welfare is\r\nreally at stake and from whom the word should come._\r\n\r\nIf any other principle of public safety--say suppression of fraud,\r\nburglary or murder--was being so generally ignored, what would you\r\ndo? Would you not look up the laws of the state and find a way\r\nof letting everyone connected with their enforcement know that you\r\nexpected them to be enforced? If you found laws or appropriations\r\ninadequate, would you not see to it that every representative in\r\nthe legislature knew his constituents demanded improvement?\r\n\r\nThe legislator or public official is anxious to comply with the\r\npeople's wishes, but he must know what the people want. It is essential\r\nto _let him know_ that you want a progressive and liberally supported\r\nstate policy that will save our immense forest wealth from needless\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nFORESTRY AND THE LUMBERMAN\r\n\r\nTHE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES\r\n\r\nThe lumber industry is undergoing a process of reorganization which\r\nreaches to its very foundations. It is so deep-seated as to be\r\nalmost imperceptible from outward evidence, but is of profound\r\nsignificance to the owner of timber land and to the public.\r\n\r\nHitherto lumbering in the United States has consisted chiefly of\r\nmanufacturing and selling. The raw material has occupied no consistent\r\nplace in the equation. The value it has had in fixing the price\r\nof the finished product has been merely in its relation to\r\ntransportation. Intrinsically it has been accorded no value. This\r\nsituation continued just as long as there was practically free\r\nGovernment timber to be had by opening it up.\r\n\r\nIt continues now only relatively, however. Transportation must\r\nalways remain a great factor; the timber owner is still obliged\r\ntemporarily to meet his obligations by means determined under the\r\nold basis. Nevertheless, the moment it became impossible to get\r\ntimber to manufacture without assuming the costs of producing,\r\nsuch as fire protection, taxation and interest, began an era of\r\ninevitable natural regulation. From that time on timber began to\r\nassume a value which, although affected by transportation facilities,\r\nmust eventually be fixed chiefly by the cost of growing other timber\r\nto compete with it.\r\n\r\nTIMBER IS WORTH THE COST OF GROWING IT\r\n\r\nIn other words, the value of anything is what it costs to produce\r\nit, whether it is a tree or a box of apples. That we found our\r\ntimber orchard growing when we came to this country does not change\r\nthis law. It was suspended temporarily while any individual could\r\nprofit by the growth produced without cost, but began to operate\r\nagain when he could no longer do so. We are now in a transition\r\nperiod of adjustment. The important thing to remember is that this\r\nwill not continue until the entire output has actually borne the\r\nfull cost of production, for before then investments in standing\r\ntimber will have been regulated by the same influence.\r\n\r\nIt is true that at present the cost of lumber to the consumer is not\r\nfixed absolutely even by the cost of manufacturing and selling it,\r\nand that on the contrary it fluctuates greatly with the willingness\r\nof the consumer to buy. But this, except within limits, is not a\r\nsound working out of the law of supply and demand. It is an incident\r\nto the unsound basis of production which still prevails. So long\r\nas a very large portion of our standing timber has not cost the\r\nowner much in either price, protection, taxes and interest, some\r\nof it will be put on the market at a low price in order to carry\r\na milling business through a depressed period, to realize money,\r\nor for other exigency reasons. So may a wheat grower lose money on\r\none or two years' crops. But if in the long run the world refuses\r\nto pay for wheat what it costs to grow it, wheat will not be grown.\r\nThe real question is whether or not the world needs forests enough\r\nto pay for them.\r\n\r\nDEMAND WILL CONTINUE\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from the history of older countries, that it does.\r\nWhile consumption per capita will undoubtedly decrease, population\r\nis growing. Substitution will be necessary, but will not supplant\r\nwood for a multitude of purposes. Much has been said about the use\r\nof steel, concrete and like materials in building. The building\r\ntrades only use 60 per cent of our lumber today, without considering\r\nfuel. It is unlikely that the reduction of this percentage will\r\nvery much more than offset the growth in volume of the reduced\r\npercentage due to increased population. Fifty years ago there was\r\nscarcely a lumber user west of the Mississippi river. We know the\r\nsettlements, mines, railroads and cities that have developed since\r\nto use lumber. It is a poor Westerner who doubts that the next fifty\r\nyears will see a far greater development. _And the Panama Canal\r\nis coming, with the certain result of making our fast-producing\r\nforests able to compete successfully with Eastern and European\r\nforest crops grown with less natural advantage._\r\n\r\nMoreover, we now use three and a half times as much wood a year\r\nas our forests produce. _Consequently the demand might even fall\r\noff three and a half times and still consume the product._ And\r\nthe forest producing area diminishes constantly. Little as we now\r\nconsider the possibilities of food famine, history shows that nations\r\nrapidly increase to the limit of their agricultural production\r\nor beyond, and we must reckon not only on our own increase but\r\nalso upon immigration from, and export to, nations whose pressure\r\nupon their production exceeds ours. It is certain that land now\r\nconsidered too remote, rough and poor for agriculture will be put\r\nto that use. We know that other countries do not to any considerable\r\nextent devote land to forest that will grow food crops at all well.\r\n\r\nADJUSTMENT ONLY QUESTION OF TIME\r\n\r\nConsequently it is safe to assume that within reasonable limits\r\nthe consumer will be glad to pay the cost of growing timber when he\r\nis obliged to do so. It is also to be expected that the community\r\nwill desire to maintain a resource which employs labor, pays taxes,\r\nand conserves stream flow. Therefore, the price of lumber will be\r\ngoverned, as the price of every staple commodity is governed, by\r\na cost of production including reasonable profit by those engaged\r\nin the several stages of the process. That it will include the\r\ngrowing of new timber on a sound, profitable basis is proved by the\r\nhistory of other countries which have undergone the same regulation.\r\nThis, after all, is the strongest argument with which to answer\r\nthe skeptic who, on premises and judgment of his own, doubts the\r\nabove conclusions. We need not claim greater prophetic ability, but\r\nhave only to make the undeniable assertion that hindsight is better\r\nthan foresight. Nothing demonstrates economic laws so irrefutably\r\nas experience.\r\n\r\nLess than 29 per cent of the land area of the United States is\r\noccupied by forests today, including swamps, burns and much land\r\nwhich will be devoted to agriculture. Germany, where great economy\r\nof material is practiced, where wooden buildings are far fewer,\r\nwhere, indeed, the per capita consumption is only a seventh of\r\nours, keeps _26 per cent_ of her land area under the most expensive\r\nforest management _and finds the profit constantly increasing_. She\r\nis increasing her production and importing heavily from countries\r\nwhere lumber is cheap, like the United States, yet the net returns\r\nper acre from the forests of Baden rose from $2.38 in 1880 to $5.08\r\nin 1902. This was due hugely, of course, to improvement of management.\r\nIn France lands which only fifty years ago could not be sold for\r\n$4 an acre now bring an annual revenue of $3. In 1903 the town\r\nforest of Winterthur, Switzerland, brought net receipts of $11.69\r\nan acre. These are fair examples in countries where the influence\r\ntending toward less use of wood have been working for a very long\r\ntime. They show such influences do not result in refusal to pay the\r\ncost of growing all the wood that can be grown. Wood consumption\r\nin European countries is increasing at a rate of from 1-1/2 to 2 per\r\ncent a year. In other words, the consumers are actually willing to\r\npay for more wood than they have found necessary, and are warranting\r\nthe growers in adopting still more expensive methods to increase\r\nthe output. Nor has forest growing proved to be possible only by\r\nthe State or Government. In Germany 46.5 per cent of the forest\r\narea is owned privately, in Austria 61 per cent, in France 65 per\r\ncent, in Norway 70 per cent. While it is true that the European\r\nprivate owner has better tax and fire conditions, it must also\r\nbe remembered that the value of the land on which he makes the\r\ngrowing crop yield a good dividend is about ten times as high as\r\nit now is in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe prospective grower of new timber in the American West can expect\r\nequal profit here at some time. His chief concern is whether its\r\nforeshadowing influences are sufficiently strong at present. To\r\ndetermine this he must consider the probable attitude of the public\r\nand of the lumbermen themselves.\r\n\r\nWHAT IT MEANS TO THE CONSUMER\r\n\r\nTo the consumer the principles previously outlined mean that the\r\nprice of lumber will rise somewhat. Indeed, he must expect that,\r\nregardless of the production factor, for the timber owner cannot\r\npay taxes, prevent fire, and keep his money tied up, all for a\r\nconsiderable period, and still sell the material as cheap as he\r\ncould before these expenses accrued. It also means that if the\r\nconsumer fails to recognize and concede these principles it will\r\nbe at his own sacrifice. Too low prices now merely mean too high\r\nprices in the early future, for they will not permit protection,\r\neconomy or reforestation. He must eventually, and not far hence,\r\npay the total cost of production. It is urgently to his interest\r\nnot to add to this by preventing production and thus permitting the\r\nowner of the timber already produced to speculate on the approaching\r\nshortage.\r\n\r\nThe danger of this can be illustrated by a comparison. Suppose\r\nthree-quarters of the apple growers of the country, either through\r\nignorance of the principles of their industry or through shortage\r\nof money with which to pay their debts, should be forced for a\r\nconsiderable period to accept a price for their crop so low that\r\nafter paying current bills they were obliged to neglect their orchards\r\nabsolutely, without plowing, fencing or spraying. Suppose further\r\nthat the public should also destroy a large portion of the orchards,\r\nas the forests are by fire, and also overtax the land so as to\r\ncomplete the discouragement. Clearly apples would immediately go\r\nup. A few growers would doubtless escape absolute destruction and\r\nthese, as long as their orchards lasted, would demand a price\r\noverbalancing many times the saving the consumer made temporarily\r\nwhile he was destroying the industry. Everyone concerned would be\r\nworse off than if prices had remained just high enough to maintain\r\nan adequate supply.\r\n\r\nIt is improbable, however, that the consumer will ever voluntarily\r\npay more than he has to, even if it is to his ultimate advantage.\r\nThe most that can be hoped is that as the public at large comes\r\nto understand the situation, it will not support him in the claim\r\nthat injustice is being done by the rises he is forced to meet\r\nas conditions adjust themselves. His reluctance will retard, but\r\nnot stop, the progress of good forest management.\r\n\r\nSTATES WILL TAKE A HAND\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is reasonable to suppose that the people of\r\nthe timber-producing states will gradually come to see that their\r\ninterest, as well as that of the lumberman, is to be furthered\r\nby placing the industry on a sound basis. Selling more lumber than\r\nthey consume, they will not rejoice over low prices any more than\r\na wheat state does over the fall of wheat because it uses some\r\nflour, but they will be equally unable to exert much stiffening\r\ninfluence on the price. Consequently they will probably attempt to\r\nsustain the industry by increasing production. But in this attempt\r\nthey will consider immediate community advantage first, future\r\ncommunity advantage next, and the lumberman's advantage only as it\r\nis incidental. And such measures as they endorse they are likely\r\nto enforce by law.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that two forces are making for the better handling of\r\nour forest resources; the economic necessity of the public and the\r\nbusiness advantage of the owner. Both demand the maximum production.\r\nObviously, since their aims are identical, each has to gain from\r\nearnest coöperation. Neither can succeed alone, for the owner cannot\r\ngo far against hostile laws or sentiment, and the public cannot\r\naccomplish half as much by compulsion as by encouraging the owner.\r\nBut the great danger to each lies in mutual distrust, which defers\r\nthe establishment of effective coöperation.\r\n\r\nLUMBERMAN MUST SHOW GOOD FAITH\r\n\r\nThe primary and all-important moral which all this points out to\r\nthe lumberman is that his position under coming conditions will\r\nbe largely what he makes it by his own attitude. With the rapidity\r\nwith which he gets into a position where his voice is listened to\r\nas unselfish and authoritative on the conservation subject, will\r\nhis influence on the new conditions be measured. Therefore, he\r\nmust study the subject. He must be able to support good laws and\r\noppose bad laws with facts and arguments which will stand scrutiny.\r\nAbove all, he must show faith by practicing what he preaches so\r\nfar as he is able. He must show conclusively the injustice of the\r\npublic suspicion from which he suffers.\r\n\r\nConservative forest management has three essentials: Protection,\r\nutilization and reproduction. The last particularly depends on the\r\nfirst. The timber owner cannot protect adequately alone. Before he\r\ncan expect much public help, however, he must show his willingness\r\nto do his share, for the state will not assume the whole burden.\r\nThe progressive members of the industry have shown it already, and\r\nthe result is evident in the commencement of the states to help.\r\nTheir help will increase in the proportion that private effort\r\nspreads.\r\n\r\nPresumably it will be the same with reforestation. With the fire\r\nhazard lessened there will remain the obstacle of overtaxation on\r\nproperty returning no income with which to meet it. The public\r\nwill doubtless soon see that this is bad for the community, but\r\nwill hesitate to forego present revenue in order to reap greater\r\nfuture revenue until convinced that the owner will actually reforest\r\nif given the chance. Even if no actual desire to take advantage\r\nis ascribed, there may be fear that he will make no active effort\r\nto start and protect the second crop, but will merely continue\r\nthe course of least expense in the hope that a new forest will\r\nestablish itself, with little to lose if it fails. Before he will\r\nreceive the encouragement he deserves, he must prove his good faith.\r\nThe surest way to do this is to begin actual work now, where he\r\ncan without certainty of failure. Unfortunately, this is often\r\nimpossible, but he can at least study and experiment so he can\r\nargue convincingly that mutual success will follow reasonable\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES DETERMINE PROFIT\r\n\r\nLet us assume, then, that it is best for the lumberman to start the\r\npractice of forestry for the purpose of strengthening his position\r\nand getting the most favorable conditions possible for its general\r\nadoption and continuance. How much does he depend upon success in\r\nthis? Obviously, early public favor will hasten and add to the\r\nsecurity of forest growing as a business, but is it absolutely\r\nessential? Do existing conditions and inevitable future conditions,\r\nregardless of public intelligence, furnish premises upon which we\r\ncan calculate certain profit in some degree?\r\n\r\nThis depends upon the circumstances of the individual investor.\r\nWithout an expectation of more favorable fire and tax influences,\r\nreforestation cannot be universally recommended as a business\r\nproposition. Many timber owners are not warranted in undertaking\r\nit. Not enough are warranted in doing so to insure the future timber\r\nsupply upon which public welfare depends. Nevertheless, there are\r\nconditions under which it is a good investment. It is even probable\r\nthat for those who are well situated, the very obstacles which deter\r\nothers will be advantageous through reducing competition. _This\r\nfact is of peculiar significance to the public, for if the latter\r\nfails to stimulate reforestation generally it will play directly into\r\nthe hands of the few who are independent of encouragement_.\r\n\r\nIt is customary, in speculating upon the profits of a second timber\r\ncrop, to attempt to reduce it to a financial calculation based upon\r\nestimated yield, estimated future values and estimated carrying\r\ncharges. These considerations are important, but their importance is\r\nlargely in proportion to the financial weakness of the prospective\r\ntimber grower. We revert again to the practical certainty that unless\r\nreforestation is general, the exhaustion of virgin timber will be\r\nfollowed by a shortage, and that the man who has a second crop at that\r\ntime can obtain a price which will reimburse his carrying charges\r\nbe they high or low. The cost of overcoming present obstacles will\r\nbe shifted to the consumer. The possibility of such an investment\r\nis determined largely by ability to maintain a protective system\r\nwith economy and to bear the expense of this and of heavy taxation\r\nduring the period of no return.\r\n\r\nIn short, the weakness of the ordinary financial calculation upon\r\nexisting conditions is that it attempts to estimate future stumpage\r\nvalues without knowledge of the true factor which will determine\r\nthem. This factor is not the probable rise of existing stumpage\r\nwhile it continues to exist, but is the extent of the new-grown\r\nsupply which will follow it provided existing conditions remain\r\nunchanged. It is inconsistent to figure the cost upon almost prohibitive\r\npresent conditions without also recognizing that such conditions, if\r\ncontinued, will completely change the influences which now determine\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\nWHO CAN AFFORD TO REFOREST NOW\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, timber owners have by no means equal opportunity\r\nto take advantage of this fact. The productive capacity of their\r\nland varies, their taxes vary, the extent and location of their\r\nholdings affects the expense of protection against fire, and they\r\nhave not the same facilities for financing a long term investment.\r\nIt is the balance of these factors that determine their opportunity.\r\nAssuming rate of timber growth to be equal, present fire and tax\r\nconditions classify them in relative advantage about as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Owners of large holdings of virgin timber who can meet carrying\r\ncharges by occasional sales at a profit over their purchase price,\r\nbut will not sell much more than is necessary because all they\r\ncan afford to hold is advancing in value. Such owners have more\r\nor less land deforested by fire or their own milling operations,\r\nand will incline to sell only stumpage without land. This land is\r\nnot easily realized upon at present, and for the speculative reason\r\nstated, they will continue in business long enough to grow a new\r\ncrop on it. The larger their holdings, the greater the certainty of\r\nthis and the cheaper, relatively, the cost of protection. Moreover,\r\nconcerns dealing with large and long term investments can consider\r\na lower interest rate.\r\n\r\n2. Owners with less facility for making an actual profit through\r\ngrowing timber, but desiring to maintain a milling business. Even\r\nif the cost of growing approaches or equals the value of the crop,\r\nthey will be able to count on continued manufacturing profit.\r\n\r\n(Both of the above classes face a possibility of so heavy a tax on\r\ntheir virgin timber in some instances that they will be obliged to\r\ncut it and go out of business. This is unlikely to occur generally,\r\nhowever, for tax reform is almost inevitable, and it would have a\r\ncompensatory effect of enhancing the value of the second crop.)\r\n\r\n3. Owners whose holdings are not large enough to keep them in business\r\nuntil a second crop matures but are advantageously located. Second\r\ngrowth need not be mature to have a value. As the present supply\r\ndiminishes, available coming supply will gain a high expectation\r\nvalue which can be realized upon. The profit it offers will be\r\nlargely determined by its proximity to market and especially by its\r\nproximity to established mills which see their own supply running\r\nshort and have failed, through inability or lack of foresight, to\r\nengage in reforestation themselves. It will also be affected by\r\ntax and fire charges, and the latter, especially, will be largely\r\na matter of location.\r\n\r\n4. The owner with no peculiar advantages, who can only set the\r\ngeneral certainty of a market for second growth against his ability\r\nto carry a costly and uncertain investment for an indeterminate\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nOf course a first consideration in most cases is the comparative\r\nprofits of other possible investments or, in other words, the exact\r\ninterest demanded as satisfactory. Individuals are in by no means\r\nthe same position in this respect by either inclination, opportunity\r\nor talent. Where one might be safer with his money in timber, another\r\ncould make more by manufacturing. Generally speaking, however,\r\nconservative judgment leads to the conclusion that the present\r\nattitude of the public warrants the first of the above four classes\r\nof owners in undertaking inexpensive reforestation where the land\r\nhas little sale value for other purposes and where the growth and\r\nfire factors are reasonably favorable. The second class can also\r\nundertake it to advantage on much the same basis, but having less\r\ncapacity for meeting the carrying charge, requires still more favorable\r\nconditions. The third class must have the maximum advantage of\r\nevery kind. It must calculate closely on the factors of cost and\r\nprofit indicated by present conditions. In most cases the risk\r\nwill be too great for prudence, and in nearly all financial ability\r\nwill be lacking. The fourth class cannot even consider it until\r\nthe public's attitude changes.\r\n\r\nBETTER DAY FOR ALL IS NEAR\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is reasonable to suppose that publicly-imposed\r\nobstacles will decrease. It will become apparent that their persistence\r\nis bad economy. Fires will grow fewer and the state will aid in\r\npatrol. Reforestation in itself is a method of fire prevention\r\nwhen it places a green young growth on a fire-inviting tract of\r\nsun-dried litter and weeds. Taxation will be deferred. As the country\r\ndevelops interest rates will fall; making it easier to carry forest\r\ninvestments and harder to gain more through other investments. The\r\nstate itself will engage more and more in forestry, with the result\r\nof making its principles understood and endorsed. Stumpage values will\r\nincrease. Immature timber will have a sale value, lessening the term\r\nof investment. Gradually the business will get on a sound production\r\nbasis, better for the consumer, better for the state supported by\r\na forest income, and more profitable for the grower. Instead of\r\ncapitalizing bad management and the sacrifice of the consumer,\r\nwhich in effect it does now by forcing the prospective grower to\r\ncalculate on covering unnecessary cost in the price received, it\r\nwill capitalize the earning power of forest land.\r\n\r\nWhile final adjustment on this basis is still in the future, it is\r\nby no means entirely dependent upon popular foresight. The process\r\nis going on constantly, whether we know it or not. The sun is still\r\nbehind the horizon, but the day is sure. Many Western timber owners\r\nare still in too dim a light to make their footsteps certain; others\r\nhave a high vantage ground where dawn already lights the path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFORESTRY AND THE FOREST\r\n\r\nELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF FOREST GROWTH\r\n\r\nWhether the lumberman's judgment of economic influences leads him to\r\nbe optimistic or otherwise as to the profit of forestry in general,\r\nhe is most interested in the particular forest with which he has\r\nto deal. He can neither accept nor dismiss the proposition\r\nintelligently, much less put his ideas into actual practice, without\r\nknowing something of the capability of his land to respond to his\r\neffort. \"What methods are best, what will they cost, and what will\r\nbe the result?\" are questions which arise at the very outset. They\r\nlead at once into the domain of technical forestry.\r\n\r\nWith us forestry has not been practiced long enough to furnish\r\ndemonstrated examples with which to answer such questions. We can,\r\nhowever, profit by experience gained elsewhere, for the laws which\r\ngovern tree life are as universal as those which govern the life of\r\nmen and animals. In dealing with new species and new environments\r\nwe have no great difficulty in judging their future from their\r\npast, which lies written plainly for those who care to study it.\r\n\r\nWhile to some extent trees require elements obtainable only from\r\nthe soil, they are more independent in this respect than most other\r\nforms of vegetation. Soil influences forest trees mainly by its\r\nphysical character, especially as this determines the moisture\r\ncontents. Very little nourishment is actually taken out of the\r\nsoil for, as someone has said, wood is nothing but air solidified\r\nby sunshine. A tree's immense and complicated foliage system is\r\nthe laboratory with which it effects this transformation.\r\n\r\nSince air exists everywhere and the chemical quality of the soil\r\nis comparatively unimportant, the requirements of different species\r\nfor light, heat and moisture are what mainly determine their\r\ndistribution and habits of growth. And since heat and moisture are\r\nlargely climatic factors and fairly uniform in given localities,\r\nit follows that the demand of a species upon light may practically\r\nfix its habits and possibilities in those localities. The very great\r\nvariance of species in light requirement accounts to a large extent\r\nfor the composition of most primeval forests. It is of peculiar\r\nimportance in the management of forests by man because he cannot\r\ncontrol it as he may be able to control some of the other agencies\r\nwhich affected the primeval forest, such as fire or seed supply.\r\n\r\nSELECTION FORESTS\r\n\r\nIt would be unprofitable to discuss here all the many methods of\r\nforest management which have proved to be best, technically, for\r\ngiven species and combinations of species. Where market and\r\ntransportation facilities are highly favorable, as in Europe, the\r\ntimber owner can adopt the method which will bring the best results,\r\nbut here he has no such choice. He can but bear in mind certain\r\nfundamental principles, uniformly applicable to large areas for\r\nconsiderable periods of time. Roughly, however, our Western forests\r\ncan be classified by their adaptability to the two directly opposite\r\nsystems, known as clean cutting and selection cutting, of which\r\nalmost all methods are modifications.\r\n\r\nA selection forest is one in which all ages of trees exist, from\r\nseedling to maturity. It is the natural growth of species which\r\nare tolerant of shade. In a natural state, undisturbed by cutting,\r\nit maintains much the same aspect continuously, for as the oldest\r\ntrees die, their place is taken by younger ones. Obviously such a\r\nforest must be composed of species, whether one or several, which\r\ncan grow beneath its own shade. The understories of varying ages\r\nare as dense as their light requirements and the density of the\r\noverwood permit.\r\n\r\nThe common hardwood forests of the East illustrate one type of\r\nthe natural selection forest. On the Pacific slope an example is\r\nafforded by hemlock, either practically pure or mixed with white\r\nfir, but probably the most typical is the ordinary Western yellow\r\npine under certain conditions. At its best this tree composes a\r\nforest so dense that all young growth is shaded out, but everyone\r\nis familiar with the frequent opener stand containing all ages.\r\nThe younger trees are often called blackjack.\r\n\r\nEVEN-AGED FORESTS\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, trees extremely intolerant of shade occur only\r\nin what the forester calls even-aged forests. Being unable to start\r\nin the darkness of an existing stand of any considerable density,\r\nthey must seize opportunities to recover openings. The Douglas\r\nfir of the Northwest, more commonly called red or yellow fir, is\r\nan excellent illustration. In the interior states this species\r\nreproduces under cover to some extent, because there is a stronger\r\nlight average throughout the year and because the stand is not so\r\ndense. In the typical Douglas fir forests of Oregon and Washington,\r\ndiscussed in this booklet, it never does so. While hemlock, cedar\r\nand white fir undergrowth may be abundant, Douglas fir seedlings\r\nare seldom seen except in burns, slashings, roads, or open spots\r\nin the woods. And the fir trees composing the dominant stand are\r\nof nearly the same age.\r\n\r\nHow, then, did this even-aged fir forest begin? Close scrutiny\r\nwill practically always find the answer in fragments of charred\r\nwood. Long ago another similar forest occupied the ground until\r\nlightning or an Indian's fire started a new cycle. Possibly recurring\r\nburns swept the area many times before wind-blown seeds began to\r\nstart advance groups of fir, which, when fifteen or twenty years\r\nold, themselves fruited and filled the blanks between them. Perhaps\r\ndestruction was not so complete and surviving trees made the process\r\na swifter one. Except in the very oldest forests, where remains\r\nof the original stand have entirely rotted away, the history in\r\neither case may be read in ancient snags and fallen logs.\r\n\r\nSuppose, however, that fire had not come to aid the fir in perpetuating\r\nitself? This, too, we can answer from the signs today. Every\r\nNorthwestern woodsman knows tracts of varying size (usually small\r\nbecause fire has been almost universal) covered with big old hemlock,\r\nwhite fir and cedar, with here and there a dying giant fir, perhaps,\r\nbut mainly showing fir occupancy only by rotting stumps and logs. No\r\nsign of fire is seen. When this fir forest was approaching middle\r\nage, the shade bearing species began to appear beneath it. As the\r\nfirs began to crowd themselves out, the later comers shot up with\r\nthe increased light and filled the open places. At last the even-aged\r\nfir forest was completely transformed into a selection forest of\r\nother trees, which will remain until some accident again gives\r\nfir a chance if any survives near enough to reach the spot with\r\nseed.\r\n\r\nDouglas fir is not the only Western tree which usually grows in\r\neven-aged stands. Lodgepole pine has the same habit, often supplanting\r\nyellow pine after fire or logging. Western white pine is perhaps more\r\ntolerant than Douglas fir, hence more likely to hold its own without\r\nartificial aid, but is also more certain to compete successfully\r\nif it has such aid. The same is true of tamarack.\r\n\r\nNATURE AS A MODEL\r\n\r\nWe thus see that if economic reasons suggest it, we may use the\r\nselection system as a basis for artificially managing the shade\r\nbearing species such as hemlock, white fir, cedar, spruce, and even\r\nWestern yellow pine. We may cut the largest and oldest trees and\r\nstill have a well started second crop. If there is not much young\r\ngrowth to leave, even a little is valuable. It may be decidedly\r\nbest to leave medium sized trees, which otherwise we would cut,\r\nbecause they are still growing rapidly.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we see that this method would not be of any\r\nadvantage at all in insuring a second crop of Douglas fir, for\r\nthere is no young growth of this species to protect. The small and\r\nmedium sized trees, instead of being immature, are merely stunted\r\nspecimens of the same age as their larger brothers and unlikely\r\nto gain in size if left. Selection cutting here would save for\r\nfuture use only such understory of shade-bearing species as may\r\nexist. Unless this is an object, the best plan is to cut clean and\r\nget all we can. If we leave any fir at all it is for the purpose of\r\nreseeding, not to secure better utilization of the trees themselves,\r\nand whether we do so depends, theoretically at least, upon whether it\r\nis better than artificial seeding or planting. In short, selection\r\ncutting harvests the ripest trees of a perpetual forest, while\r\nclean cutting destroys the forest in order to start an entirely\r\nnew and more rapid growing one.\r\n\r\nClean cutting is therefore necessary as well as natural in dealing\r\nwith intolerant trees. But it does not follow that the selection\r\nsystem, although natural to tolerant species, is the only one adaptable\r\nto them. While the one class demands light, the other does not\r\ndemand shade. It is merely capable of enduring it. Indeed, except\r\nfor the greater susceptibility of some species to extreme heat\r\nand dryness when very young, as a rule shade bearing trees grow\r\nmuch better if they do have ample light supply. Consequently clean\r\ncutting may be the best system for these also under certain economic\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nBesides its influence upon the occurrence of species in the forest,\r\nlight practically governs the physical form of the individual tree.\r\nIf grown in an opening and not artificially pruned, a tree will have\r\na conical trunk and living branches almost down to the ground. The\r\ndenser and consequently darker the forest, the more cylindrical the\r\ntrunk, the smaller the crown of branches and the greater the clear\r\nlength. The individual tree has no object in assuming a desirable\r\ncommercial form and does so only when deprived of side light by\r\nnumerous neighbors. Then it sacrifices diameter growth to height\r\ngrowth in reaching for the top light necessary for its life. At\r\nthe same time the lower branches are killed by shade and drop off,\r\nthe scars being healed and eventually buried. The pin knots near\r\nthe center of a big clear log are the remains of branches which\r\nwhen living were at the top of the young tree.\r\n\r\nThis is why, if it is to produce good timber, any forest must be\r\ndense enough to cover the ground throughout the early part of its\r\nlife at least. When we see an excellent clear stand of mature Douglas\r\nfir, for example, we may know that it consists of the comparatively\r\nfew survivors of a close sapling growth in which the weak were\r\ngradually killed out after serving their office of pruning and\r\nforcing the vigorous. Had only the trees we now see been on the\r\nground they would be worthless except for firewood. For the same\r\nreason artificial forest planting must be thick, although the fillers\r\nor nurse trees may be of inferior species if not of so rapid growth\r\nas to gain the mastery.\r\n\r\nNature teaches many lessons which we must recognize in artificial\r\nmanagement or fail, but she is no more the best grower of forest\r\ncrops than she is of agricultural crops. We have to study natural\r\nmethods of forest perpetuation to see how they may be improved upon\r\nas much as to adopt them as models. As a rule the virgin forest is\r\nexceedingly wasteful of ground. The possibilities under intelligent\r\ncare are not indicated by nature's average, but by her accidental\r\nbest, and usually they far exceed even this. A fair comparison is\r\nthat of scientific farming with unsystematic gleaning from wild\r\nand untended fields. The foregoing general principles of forest\r\ngrowth have been purposely outlined very briefly so as to serve\r\nas a mere introduction to their application or modification in\r\nconcrete cases.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC TYPES\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS FIR (_Pseudotsuga taxifolia_)\r\n\r\nCompared with most important commercial trees, the Northwestern\r\nDouglas fir is remarkably easy to reproduce. It is an abundant\r\nseeder, grows very rapidly, and inhabits a region with every climatic\r\nadvantage. In the typical fir districts of Oregon and Washington\r\ndeforested land which escapes recurring fire is usually restocked\r\nnaturally and with astonishing rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe exceptions to this rule are where the destruction of seed trees\r\nhas been wide and absolute, where already established competing\r\nspecies are not removed with the original forest, and where the\r\nsurviving fir is too old to seed. The two latter conditions are\r\nmost prevalent near the coast, where the wet climate not only tends\r\nto protect slashings from fire and thus preserve the undergrowth of\r\nshade bearing species which escapes logging, but has also prevented\r\nthe accidental destruction in the past of the original fir stand\r\nby fire.\r\n\r\nIn considering these natural results as they bear upon proposed\r\nmethods, we find actual destruction of seed supply the easiest\r\nto avoid. If the original stand contains suitable seed trees we\r\ncan protect a sufficient number of them. If not, or if it is less\r\nexpensive, we can secure seed elsewhere. More frequent difficulty\r\nwill lie in determining whether the reproduction of fir should\r\nbe the sole effort, or whether it should not be sacrificed, if\r\nnecessary, in order to utilize an existing start toward a second\r\ncrop of other species. This is of peculiar and early importance,\r\nfor it usually also decides the question of protecting the slashing\r\nfrom fire.\r\n\r\nIf the present stand is nearly pure fir, or if other species are\r\nrepresented almost wholly by merchantable trees, there will be no\r\nyoung growth worth saving. A new crop must be started from seed, and\r\nsince fir is the quickest and easiest to grow, as well as probably\r\nthe most valuable, it should be given every encouragement.\r\n\r\n_Slash Burning and Its Exceptions._\r\n\r\nIn most cases this requires burning the ground after logging, not\r\nonly to reduce the future fire risk but also to provide a suitable\r\nseedbed. Fir much prefers mineral soil to start in, as is easily\r\nseen from the far greater frequency of seedlings on road grades\r\nthan on adjacent undisturbed ground covered with humus and rotten\r\nwood. Hemlock has no such fastidiousness, even preferring rotten\r\nwood as a seedbed. To protect the slashing from fire, therefore,\r\nboth preserves the most unfavorable conditions for fir and subjects\r\nit to unnecessary competition by its rival. Hemlock seedlings already\r\nestablished, seeds lying on the ground, and surrounding or surviving\r\ntrees which may scatter more seed, are all encouraged to shade and\r\nstifle the struggling fir seedlings already handicapped by dislike\r\nfor their situation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a large proportion of what we now consider typically\r\nfir forest has a vigorous ground cover of hemlock and cedar which may\r\nbecome merchantable many years before an entirely new fir crop can be\r\ngrown. The presumably greater value of the latter may be consumed by\r\nthe heavier carrying charge before returns are available. Certainly\r\nif the promise of profit from other species and the difficulty of\r\nestablishing fir both reach the extreme, protection of the growth\r\nalready started is the best forestry if it is practicable. Moreover,\r\nthere may be considerable young growth of other species under conditions\r\nwhich do not preclude satisfactory additional reseeding by fir.\r\n\r\nWhen the owner is in position to plan far into the future, like the\r\nGovernment or State, he may seek a temporary compromise, although\r\nexpecting eventually to secure pure fir. In such a case it may often\r\nbe best to utilize a first new crop of hemlock, but on harvesting\r\nthis a few decades hence to burn clean and start the next rotation\r\nwith fir only.\r\n\r\n_Conditions Vary Methods._\r\n\r\nBetween conditions clearly suggesting one course or another, all\r\ngradations will present themselves and no written rule can be given\r\nfor determining the dividing line. Much depends upon future relative\r\nvalues of species, upon which the owner will have his own opinion.\r\nMore depends upon the character of existing young growth and consequent\r\nadaptability to changed conditions after logging. Even a very thick\r\nstand of young hemlock is unlikely to produce much if the overwood\r\nhas been very dense, for much of it may be so old and stunted by shade\r\nthat sudden advent of strong light will result merely in distorted\r\nworthless branch growth or in killing it outright. Occasional vigorous\r\nyoung trees just under present merchantable size are of doubtful\r\nvalue because they are likely to blow down. The most promising\r\nclass of undergrowth found in fir forests of the Northwest is where\r\nthere has been sufficient light to produce a fairly thick stand\r\nof young hemlock or cedar from five to fifty feet high.\r\n\r\nIf the undergrowth from which any second crop may develop is\r\ninsufficient to be worth much consideration, and reseeding must\r\nbe depended upon entirely, there may still be a question as to\r\nspecies. If ample natural supply of fir seed can be expected, slash\r\nburning is indicated. But if not and the owner is not prepared to\r\nundertake the expense of artificial seeding, while at the same\r\ntime there is a promising natural hemlock supply, burning has no\r\nobject except the reduction of future fire risk. It may even retard\r\nhemlock reproduction, both by destroying part of the seed supply\r\nand by encouraging the growth of brakes on the area. The question\r\nhere is a really financial one. The cost of planting fir under these\r\nconditions may be more than reimbursed by the resultant more valuable\r\nand rapid growing crop. The owner must do his own conjecturing as\r\nto future comparative values of the species.\r\n\r\nSo far we have discussed slash burning only in its sylvicultural\r\nrelation, finding that it encourages Douglas fir reproduction and\r\nis consequently advisable in Northwestern Douglas fir types unless\r\nthere is an exceptionally promising second growth already started.\r\nThe balance will be further in its favor, in doubtful cases, because\r\nof the protective feature. This is discussed more fully in another\r\nchapter, but it is well to recall here that immunity from recurring\r\nfire is the first essential of profitable reforestation. To secure\r\nsecond growth by treatment which threatens its destruction later\r\nis bad management unless the original saving is ample to cover\r\nsubsequent greater cost of protection. This is seldom the case.\r\n\r\n_How to Reseed the Area._\r\n\r\nDismissing the exceptions noted, and returning to our rule that\r\nanother crop of Douglas fir is usually the best secured by following\r\nnature--cutting practically clean, burning the ground and starting\r\na new even-aged stand--we have still to consider means of getting\r\nthis stand started. We may depend upon natural reseeding from trees\r\npreserved for the purpose or from the surrounding forest, or we\r\nmay resort to planting. What are the comparative advantages of\r\nthese two methods and the circumstances governing choice between\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nHitherto, students of the subject have inclined to favor natural\r\nreproduction. The very general second growth on deforested land\r\nwhere no aid has been given indicates that excellent results will\r\nfollow slight assistance. Red fir fruits frequently and profusely,\r\nand the seeds carry well in the wind. Burns have been known to\r\nrestock fully from seed blown from forested hills a mile or more\r\naway. Moreover, while planting always involves initial expense,\r\nsometimes much may be done to insure natural seeding with little\r\nor no actual outlay.\r\n\r\nThere is danger, however, that in many instances this economy will\r\nbe more apparent than real if it is effected by actually leaving much\r\nvalue in seed trees. Abroad and in the East there is comparatively\r\nlittle loss in leaving even a fourth or fifth of the original stand\r\nto furnish seed. The individual trees left may be good seeders,\r\nalthough small. Little capital is tied up in them and they may\r\nbe utilized later to equal advantage. A mature fir forest of the\r\nPacific coast may have no small fruiting trees at all, and if left\r\nsuch are likely to be knocked down in logging. To leave 20 per\r\ncent of the large trees standing would sometimes tie up 20,000\r\nfeet to the acre, worth $40 or $50. Age and windfall may cause loss\r\nequal to stumpage increase; moreover, they can never be utilized\r\nwithout the same expense for roads and machinery that is necessary\r\nin the original logging. The second crop will not be allowed to\r\nreach a size requiring such equipment. In considering possible\r\nwindfall loss, not the normal wind but the possible maximum storm\r\nwithin the entire life of the second crop must be reckoned with.\r\n\r\nIt is probably safe to say of mature Pacific coast fir that leaving\r\nenough merchantable timber on a cutting area for adequate seeding\r\ncosts more than to use it and restock. Restocking can be done for\r\n$2 to $10 an acre, which would leave a decided margin for profit\r\non the seed trees. And if we undertake to reduce this balance by\r\nleaving very few seed trees, we decrease the certainty of successful\r\nreproduction and increase the danger of entire failure through\r\nwindfall or accidental destruction when we burn the slashing. It\r\ncannot be denied, however, that fire after planting would result\r\nin complete loss, while seed trees might restock the area again\r\nand again after such accidents.\r\n\r\n_Natural Reproduction._\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, natural reproduction does not always require\r\nthe leaving of merchantable timber on the cutting area. Frequently\r\nthere are enough crooked or conky trees to serve the purpose. These\r\ndefects are not directly transmissible through seed to the offspring,\r\nalthough conk is infectious and the young crop should be protected\r\nby the removal of the diseased parents after it is well started.\r\n\r\nAgain, seeding from adjacent timber can often be relied upon. This\r\nis a question of economy in logging operations, lay of the ground,\r\nprevailing wind direction, fertility of the stand and other local\r\nconsiderations. A valley with healthy fir woods on either side is\r\nlikely to seed up promptly even if a half mile wide. So is a flat\r\nat the leeward foot of a hill timbered on the summit where the\r\nwind strikes. A cutting on a ridge is correspondingly unlikely to\r\nrestock. Theoretically if a tract of timber were large enough, it\r\ncould be opened up by logging operations which, instead of proceeding\r\nsteadily from one edge, might skip every other landing or so until\r\nthe most remote portion was reached after a few years, and then\r\nwork back again, cleaning up the neglected portions after they\r\nhad seeded the first openings. The same effect sometimes results\r\nfrom actual accidental practice.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that rules cannot be laid down for general application.\r\nGenerally speaking, a logger interested in fir reforestation should\r\nstudy his ground to see if naturally, or, with inexpensive aid, the\r\ncut-over area will not reseed from the sides and from the cull trees\r\nhe will leave uncut. If not, he may leave a few merchantable seed\r\nbearing trees provided the soil is such as to make them deep-rooted\r\nand wind-firm. Groups are better than single trees because less\r\nlikely to be blown down and easier to protect from the slashing\r\nfire. More should be left toward the windward edge. But before\r\ntieing up any considerable sum in merchantable trees he should\r\nconsider the cost and safety of supplementing any shortage of natural\r\nsupply by artificial seeding.\r\n\r\nWESTERN HEMLOCK (_Tsuga heterophylla_)\r\n\r\nSince hemlock is so frequently associated with Douglas fir, the\r\nprinciples governing its reproduction and its relative promise as a\r\nsecond crop have necessarily been largely covered in the preceding\r\ndiscussion of fir. The following remarks are merely additional.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the perpetuation of hemlock is advisable only\r\nwhere fir reproduction is difficult to obtain or will be at too\r\ngreat a sacrifice of valuable existing hemlock. The first of these\r\nconditions is confined chiefly to pure hemlock stands and to coast\r\nregions where the fir is often too old to seed well. The second\r\nmay exist on the coast or in certain moist interior regions where\r\nthere is a heavy hemlock undergrowth. In either case natural hemlock\r\nreproduction will be counted upon, both because it is practically\r\ncertain to occur and because if it were not certain and artificial\r\naid were necessary, we would abandon hemlock entirely and devote\r\nour efforts to fir. In short, discussion of hemlock as a second\r\ncrop need not include systematic attempts to seed the ground but\r\nmay be confined to protection of what we have to begin with.\r\n\r\nIn a straight hemlock proposition, the protection question may\r\ndiffer considerably from that involved by deciding between fir\r\nand hemlock. In the latter case, because of the assistance of fire\r\nto fir, the growth already on the ground must have considerable\r\nvalue to warrant foregoing the several advantages of slash burning.\r\nIn the former, slash burning has no object except to reduce future\r\nrisk. The inference is that a much less promising stock of young\r\ngrowth is worth protecting.\r\n\r\nWhile this is true, there is danger of overestimating its value,\r\nespecially if care is not taken in logging. It has been remarked\r\nthat suppressed misshapen hemlock is not apt to make a healthy\r\ngrowth, that windfall is a peril, and that if the previous shade has\r\nbeen heavy, sudden opening to sunlight may be fatal. It should also\r\nbe remembered that even slightly injured young hemlock is worthless,\r\nfor it is almost certain to be attacked by borers. Anything which\r\ndeadens a small portion of the bark like axe blazes, fire scorch,\r\nor scars from strap leads, is dangerous. Hemlock is more liable than\r\nfir to general defects like black streak, borers, fungous disease\r\nand mistletoe, therefore investment in reforestation needs the\r\nmaximum safeguard against them. In many instances better results may\r\nbe obtained from a new healthy seedling stand following a purifying\r\nfire, even at some loss of time, than from well started young growth\r\nwhich is unhealthy and likely not only to fail itself but also to\r\ninfect any seedlings which may come in among it. Consequently if\r\nthe slashing is not large, and reproduction from the sides may be\r\ncounted on, the above considerations, coupled with the reduction\r\nof future fire risk, may suggest slash burning just as in the case\r\nof fir. The remarks apply particularly if it is considered necessary\r\nto log as clean as possible.\r\n\r\nWith a good, healthy start toward a new forest, however, it will\r\nusually be best to keep fire out, for the material saved will warrant\r\ngreater expense in protection during the growing period. Representative\r\ntracts, both on the coast and in the Cascades, have been studied\r\nwhich showed that, with care in lumbering, enough good young hemlock\r\ntoo small for logs or skids could be saved after present-day logging\r\nof a heavy mixed fir and hemlock stand to produce in fifty years\r\n11,000 or 12,000 feet of timber over 14 inches in diameter. This\r\nwould not be wholly additional to the second crop of seedlings\r\nwhich might be produced if these trees were not preserved, for\r\nthe ground and light they use would be denied to the seedlings,\r\nbut undoubtedly the yield would be greater than could be secured\r\nif they were destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis means that under similar conditions we may go still further\r\nand actually apply the selection system, especially if the original\r\nstand is nearly pure hemlock. So far we have discussed areas left\r\nby present-day logging methods. Suppose, however, the owner of a\r\ngood tract of hemlock, having decided that conditions do not warrant\r\ntrying to get fir, is willing to modify his methods for the sake of\r\nbetter hemlock returns at some future cutting. He would probably\r\ndo best to take out only the mature trees, leaving everything which\r\nis still growing with fair rapidity. Greater light will stimulate\r\nthese immensely as well as encourage further seeding of the ground.\r\nThe few merchantable trees he spares, together with those now\r\nunmerchantable, will, in perhaps twenty years, make another excellent\r\ncrop. By leaving a fairly dense stand he prevents the windfall\r\ndanger which threatens the survivors of too vigorous cutting, and\r\nalso prevents them from assuming the branchy form of trees which\r\nreceive too much side light. The fire danger is much reduced by\r\nresultant shading of the ground and slightly by the lesser cover of\r\ndebris. In short, he makes the most economical use of the ground,\r\nand the capital represented by the trees he spares is well invested.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, hemlock lends itself to almost every form of management.\r\nDetermination as to which is most advisable is governed by its\r\nextremely variable manner of occurrence and by the local promise\r\noffered by associate species. The foregoing discussion can only\r\nserve as suggestive when considering given conditions.\r\n\r\nWESTERN CEDAR (_Thuya plicata_)\r\n\r\nExcept for small swamp and river bottom areas, where the land is\r\nlikely to be more valuable for agriculture than for forest culture,\r\npure cedar stands are not common. Therefore it is as a component of\r\nmixed stands that cedar is likely to become a problem in conservative\r\nmanagement. To some extent it presents a peculiar question by being\r\ntaken out alone for special purposes, such as poles and bolts,\r\nindependent of ordinary logging of sawtimber.\r\n\r\nWestern cedar is a typically shade-bearing tree and also endures\r\nmuch ground moisture. Its occurrence as an under story and in swamps\r\ndoes not indicate that it always requires such conditions, however,\r\nbut more often means merely that they protected it from competition\r\nor from destruction by fire. Charred remains of very large, fine\r\ncedar are often found on comparatively dry slopes where fire has\r\nresulted in complete occupation by fir at present. Cedar's failure\r\nto reappear there after removal is probably because its thin bark and\r\nshallow roots allowed its destruction by a fire which was survived\r\nby some better protected fir seed trees. Nevertheless, cedar must\r\nbe classified as a moisture-loving species and occupies dry soils\r\nonly in coast or mountain localities where there is a compensating\r\nheavy rainfall.\r\n\r\nReproduction and management of western cedar have not been sufficiently\r\nstudied to warrant very positive conclusions. This neglect is probably\r\ndue to a wide belief that in spite of its present commercial importance,\r\nits place in the future forest will be small. It most commonly occurs\r\nwith other trees in heavy stands, which make the preservation of any\r\nyoung cedar difficult because of the destructiveness of logging. Being\r\nof comparatively slow growth, also persistent in retaining branches\r\nwhen grown in the light, it is not as promising for artificial\r\nreproduction as Douglas fir or white pine. To let it become old\r\nenough for good shingle material will be too expensive to pay,\r\nfor roofing is one of the wood products easiest to substitute for.\r\nWhile cedar is adapted for poles, posts and other underground use,\r\nless decay-resisting species can be made equally durable by chemical\r\ntreatment. In other words, as a second crop it is probably below\r\nother species in ease of establishment, rapidity and quantity, and\r\nwill not have sufficient peculiar value to compensate for consequent\r\nless economical use of the ground.\r\n\r\nThere may be exceptions to this rule. Good young cedar in forests\r\nwhich are to be handled under the selection system should be carefully\r\nprotected. It can always be utilized and may bring revenue before\r\nanything else can be cut. For the same reason it has been suggested\r\nfor planting with fir and white pine, either simultaneously as a\r\nsmall proportion or later in blank spaces where the others fail.\r\nUnder such conditions the main stand will not be modified and the\r\ncedar will afford a valuable adjunct.\r\n\r\nSITKA SPRUCE (_Picea sitchensis_)\r\n\r\nAlthough found in the moister mountain regions, this exceedingly\r\nvaluable tree seldom occurs to a commercially important extent\r\nexcept along the coast, where it is common on swales and fertile\r\nbenches and in river bottoms often forms pure stands of great density.\r\nYields of 100,000 feet an acre are not unusual and the trees are\r\nvery large. It is also common, although of small size, in swamps.\r\n\r\nThis spruce reproduces readily in openings, whether made by fire\r\nor cutting. Unthrifty specimens may be found under shade, but\r\nconsiderable light is necessary for successful development. Even\r\nthen, height growth in youth averages slower than that of fir or\r\nhemlock. The leader shoot is likely to die, so that hardly more\r\nthan 25 per cent of the young trees establish a regular form of\r\ngrowth before a height of 20 or 30 feet is reached. After this\r\nstage spruce grows uniformly and rapidly, still somewhat slower\r\nthan fir in height but exceeding it in diameter. The branches are\r\nslow to die, however, so that the tree remains bushy for most of its\r\nlength until it reaches 60 or 80 feet in height, and even afterward\r\na dense stand is required to clear it. In many pure spruce forests\r\nthe larger trees have been able to withstand the pruning influences\r\nand remain limby, while the smaller ones, being pushed in height\r\ngrowth to reach sufficient light for survival, have cleared themselves\r\nwith remarkable rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe natural occurrence of Sitka spruce, except in Alaska, is probably\r\nlimited chiefly to situations where it escapes competition, in\r\nyouth at least, with the more hardy and rapid-growing species. It\r\nhas the greatest advantage over these on river bottoms and flats\r\nwhere there is a dense growth of deciduous brush and where the\r\nsoil is very wet in spring. In considering it as a possible second\r\ncrop, the same competition must be remembered. Whether seeding is\r\nnatural or artificial, the extent to which it will hold its own\r\nwith any considerable quantity of other species is doubtful. If\r\nsuch are present and the situation is adapted to them, any expensive\r\neffort to get spruce merely by modifying methods of logging or\r\nhandling the slash is certainly likely to be disappointing. Under\r\nthe conditions mentioned as peculiarly favorable for spruce, gradual\r\nnatural restocking may be expected if some seed supply is preserved,\r\nbut since the growth is rather slow and a thin stand will remain\r\nlimby, it may pay to hasten returns by supplementary artificial\r\nplanting. Some authorities question the financial practicability\r\nof this on the ground that since spruce is of slower growth it will\r\npay better to use the ground for fir, but the latter is unlikely\r\nto be true of bottom land.\r\n\r\nAfter summing all its advantages, the peculiar merits of spruce for\r\ncertain purposes should be weighed, for sufficiently higher stumpage\r\nvalue will compensate for delay in harvesting the crop. Moreover,\r\nSitka spruce has not been as thoroughly studied by foresters as\r\nthe more prominent Western trees, and while the foregoing notes\r\nrepresent general present opinion, further figures on rate of height\r\ngrowth may be more encouraging. There is no doubt that diameter\r\nincrease is rapid from the start. Most of the disadvantages mentioned\r\nalso decrease toward the southern limit of the spruce range, the\r\ngrowth on the Oregon Coast being rapid.\r\n\r\nWESTERN YELLOW PINE (_Pinus ponderosa_)\r\n\r\nIn this species we have the important western conifer which most\r\noften permits the selection system of management. With certain\r\nexceptions in which the entire stand is mature, the object of\r\nconservative logging should be to remove trees past the age of rapid\r\ngrowth and foster those that remain for a later cut. When comprising\r\nthe entire stand, or at least clearly dominating it, with all ages\r\nfairly evenly represented, successful in reproduction, and not so\r\ndense as to present mechanical difficulties, it is ideally adapted\r\nto this form of management. The important underlying principle is\r\nthat, since for a period of its life the normal individual tree\r\nincreases in wood production and then declines, it is bad economy\r\nto cut it while it is still growing rapidly or to allow it, after\r\nslowing down, to occupy ground which might be used by a tree still\r\nin the vigor of production. For example, if at 100 years old it\r\ncontains 500 board feet, it has averaged an addition of 5 feet,\r\na year throughout its life. If at 125 years old it contains but\r\n560 feet, the average increment will be but 4-1/2 feet a year.\r\nIt will not give equal return for the soil, moisture and light\r\nit monopolizes during these 25 years. At the same time, probably\r\nthere are young trees nearby which hitherto have averaged below\r\nthe maximum, but if released from its competition will forge ahead\r\nfor a period at the end of which they will give a greater annual\r\nreturn than if cut at present. It would be as bad economy to cut\r\nthese today as to spare the over-mature tree. In short, the production\r\nof the forest is not only sustained, but actually increased, by\r\nremoving the oldest trees at just the proper time; and is decreased\r\nby taking out young trees either not yet at the natural age of\r\ngreatest mean annual increment or capable of artificial stimulation\r\nby thinning.\r\n\r\nBy studying the relation of age to production in the particular\r\nlocality, the proportion of different age classes, and also finding\r\nthe approximate average diameter which corresponds to the age at\r\nwhich he desires to cut, the professional forester can make a very\r\naccurate selection of the trees which can be removed to best advantage\r\nat present and also fix the time and yield of the next cutting.\r\nFortunately, however, commercial and silvicultural considerations\r\naccidentally coincide so nearly under average yellow pine conditions\r\nas to make certain rough rules which can be laid down entirely\r\nconsistent with logging methods now in practice. Diameter is far\r\nfrom exact indication of age, for the location of the forest and\r\nthe situation of the individual tree, especially as it affects the\r\nrelation between height and diameter growth, are potent factors,\r\nbut as a rule merchantability for saw-material is not far from\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nIn a great majority of cases the approximate minimum diameter for\r\ncutting which would be fixed by it forester would be somewhere\r\nbetween 16 and 30 inches, but say it were 18 inches, for example,\r\nit would not arbitrarily apply throughout the stand. Most trees with\r\nyellow, smooth bark and small heavy-limbed tops, perhaps partially\r\ndead, are mature regardless of their size. If small, they have\r\nbeen crowded or stunted and may as well be cut. Trees with large,\r\nhealthy crowns composed of many comparatively small branches, and\r\nwith rough dark bark showing no flat scaling, are sure to be growing\r\nrapidly, even if quite large. They are also less desired by the\r\nlumberman, who often calls them black pine or black jack, so may\r\noften be spared, without much sacrifice, for seed trees or in order\r\nto continue their rapid wood production.\r\n\r\nThe seed tree problem in such a pine forest and under such a system\r\nas has been described is comparatively simple, for there are likely\r\nto be enough young trees of fruiting age left to fill up the blanks\r\nbetween existing seedlings. The density of the latter determines\r\nto a large extent the number and location of seed trees necessary,\r\nbut there should always be two to four to the acre, even if this\r\nrequires leaving some that would otherwise be logged.\r\n\r\nUnder this system recurring cuts may be made at periods of perhaps\r\n30 or 40 years, taking out each time the trees which have passed\r\nthe minimum diameter since the last previous cut. It is obvious,\r\nhowever, that if the process is to continue indefinitely, protection\r\nmust be absolute. Destruction of young growth will stop the rotation\r\nat the time the surviving older material is harvested. At each\r\ncut the brush should be disposed of with this end in view. If the\r\nstand is very thin it may not add much to the danger of fire and,\r\nespecially if reproduction is difficult and requires shelter, may\r\nbest be left spread on the ground at some distance from remaining\r\ntrees. Otherwise, and this is the rule, it should be piled and\r\nusually burned. In this process and in logging every effort should\r\nbe made to protect existing young growth from injury. Ground fires\r\nshould be prevented now and always hereafter.\r\n\r\nSo far, however, we have been considering how to make the most\r\nof a stand of many ages, due to constant reproduction permitted\r\nby the light supply in a fairly open forest. On the other hand,\r\nyellow pine sometimes produces a mature stand so heavy that there\r\nis little young growth beneath it, or even a thin old stand with\r\neither little reproduction or an invasion of lodge-pole pine. Such\r\nconditions are usually due to fire at some period. In the first\r\nof these cases, usually the dense stand has resulted from a fire\r\nwhich destroyed its predecessor not so completely as to remove the\r\nseed supply, but sufficiently to afford light for a more uniformly\r\ndense crop of seedlings than would occur in the normal forest.\r\nThese have been thinned out as the stand grew old, but never to a\r\ndegree which allowed much reproduction beneath them. The natural\r\ncycle will be begun again in time, for toward the end of the life of\r\nthis unusually heavy stand, seedlings will begin to appear gradually\r\nas individual old trees die and admit more and more light. The\r\nother exceptions described are due to more recent ground fires\r\nwhich have destroyed only the less hardy young growth and perhaps\r\nalso encouraged the lodge pole which, within its range, is always\r\nquick to take burned ground.\r\n\r\nThe same result is almost sure to follow the \"Indian\" method of\r\nforest protection sometimes advocated, which consists of purposely\r\nrunning ground fires frequently in order to prevent accumulation\r\nof sufficient debris to make an accidental fire fatal to timber of\r\ncommercial size. While such immunity may be secured, and perhaps\r\nwithout sacrifice in stands so heavy as to have no reproduction\r\nor when the latter has already been destroyed, it is obviously at\r\nthe expense of young growth if any exists. The counter argument\r\nthat a small proportion escaping will be sufficient for the second\r\ncrop is fallacious, because good timber will not be produced from\r\nthese scattering seedlings subjected to strong light by later logging.\r\nOther means are necessary if the forest is to be reproduced.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the possible management of yellow pine as an\r\neven-aged forest. Thoughtful foresters are beginning to suspect\r\nthat while the \"Indian\" system of fire protection will usually\r\nbe fatal if ordinary logging practice is followed, it may serve\r\nas an adjunct to a system which, if carefully applied, will be\r\nbetter than selection cutting for some of our pine areas. This plan\r\nis suggested where there is little young growth worth protecting\r\nand consists of depending upon seed trees almost entirely for\r\nreproduction, protecting carefully until the resultant even-aged\r\nsecond growth is large enough to stand Blight fire, and then burning\r\nperiodically at such a season and with such safeguards as will\r\nprevent the fire from being injuriously severe.\r\n\r\nNot only are there many existing forests where absence of small trees\r\nwill permit clean cutting without sacrifice, but the same condition\r\nis likely to occur eventually in stands following selective logging\r\nif the second cut is long delayed. Although a good representation\r\nof all ages under the diameter limit remains, the density of this\r\nmay become too great to allow further reproduction, and in time\r\nthe dominant trees will shade out all smaller growth. To allow this\r\npurposely, choosing heavy cuts at intervals long enough to mature\r\nthe crop from seed rather than frequent light cuts of a constantly\r\nreplenishing stand, thus reducing the necessity of fire prevention,\r\nis the aim of those who favor clean cutting as the most practicable\r\nsystem. They assume that additional investment in seed trees, or\r\nplanting to insure prompt starting of a new crop after cutting,\r\nwill be unnecessary or at least offset by the smaller fire charge\r\nand greater economy of logging.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, such practice with a species adapted to the selective\r\nmethod is uneconomical, for the ground is not fully utilized. Accidental\r\nopen places in the stand are not occupied by young trees which would\r\notherwise fill them. Time is lost by not starting the second crop\r\nuntil after logging, for were there no fire previously there would\r\nbe considerable seedling growth which, although perhaps dormant\r\nbecause of shade, would begin to amount to something much quicker than\r\nthat supplied by seed trees afterward. Nor is the system feasible\r\nwhere there is much fir or other species less fire-resisting than\r\npine. It is dangerous in practice except where there is very little\r\ncombustible matter on the ground and fire is generally easy of\r\ncontrol, and exceedingly dangerous to advocate because serves as a\r\npretext and example for indiscriminate carelessness with fire under\r\nall conditions. Finally, the alleged immunity of pine from injury by\r\nground fires is exaggerated. As a matter of fact, while the whole\r\nstand is seldom perceptibly hurt, the immediate or gradual death of\r\na good tree here and there thins the stand very considerably in a\r\nfew years and it is such a thinning process in the past which makes\r\nmany pine tracts bear but 5,000 feet to the acre where otherwise\r\nthey would yield two or three times as much. Scorching also retards\r\nthe growth of trees not actually injured otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe technical objections given above may sometimes be offset by\r\npractical advantages and the system is likely to receive expert\r\napproval for certain conditions provided it is not used as a cloak\r\nwithout taking sincere steps to replace the destroyed second growth\r\nby adequate seed trees or artificial seeding. The latter danger may\r\neasily warrant public alarm manifested by restrictive laws. Universal\r\nground burning of green timber will distinctly reduce the prospect\r\nof unassisted natural reforestation on the great area of potential\r\ntimber land in which, as a resource, regardless of ownership, the\r\npublic is vitally interested. Under present conditions at least,\r\na large proportion of this is likely to be logged without any view\r\nto a future crop. It is questionable whether any state should, or\r\nwill, legally approve ground burning except under stipulation of\r\nproper management thereafter.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it is necessary, in concluding this discussion of\r\nyellow pine, to admit that while an attempt has been made to outline\r\nthe methods which will insure a second crop, the promise of satisfactory\r\nfinancial return is more doubtful than that offered by some other\r\nspecies. Compared with the typical coast trees, such as Douglas\r\nfir, spruce and hemlock, the growth is slow and the yield small.\r\nThe chief circumstances in its favor are low land values, lesser\r\nfire risk, cheapness and certainty of reproduction and excellent\r\nmarket prospects. Less investment compensates somewhat for longer\r\nrotation and smaller yield. Low taxation, however, is an absolute\r\nessential.\r\n\r\nWESTERN WHITE PINE (_P. Monlicola_)\r\n\r\nAlthough as a distinct forest type this valuable tree is limited\r\nchiefly to Idaho, it occurs occasionally in mixture or small tracts\r\nover a wide range, and no reason appears why its commercial importance\r\nshould not be extended by planting on cut-over lands. Its high value,\r\nrapid growth and heavy yield make it a particularly promising species\r\nfor growing under forestry principles. Its chief requirements for\r\nsuccess are fairly good moist land, access by the seed to mineral\r\nsoil and ample light for the young seedlings.\r\n\r\nExcept that it is more fastidious as to soil, white pine usually\r\ndemands about the same treatment as that prescribed for Douglas\r\nfir, including clean cutting, slash burning and establishing a\r\nnew even-aged stand by seed trees or artificial restocking. Under\r\nfavorable conditions the stand is nearly even-aged, with little\r\nundergrowth except of undesirable species. What small pine may\r\nexist is seldom thrifty enough to be worth saving, so the best\r\nthing is to clean off the ground for the double purpose of removing\r\nweed trees and favoring valuable reproduction. Like that of fir,\r\nthe natural rotation of white pine forests seems to have been\r\naccomplished often by the aid of fire, and where not given this aid\r\nit suffers from lack of suitable seed-bed and from the competition\r\nof other species already established.\r\n\r\nIndividual seed trees left in logging are not successful because\r\nof shallow root system and almost certain windfall. Replacement\r\nmust be by seeding or planting, or by leaving small tracts of pine\r\nsurrounded by cleared fire lines to protect them when the slashing\r\nis burned. The size and distance apart of these must be determined\r\nby their situation and exposure to wind, considering both the danger\r\nof windfall and the carrying of seed. Especially in younger growths,\r\nthe quantity of merchantable material tied up in this way is not\r\nso great as is sometimes necessary in the case of red fir, where\r\nsingle seed trees may contain several thousand board feet. On the\r\nother hand, stumpage value may be high. For this reason artificial\r\nreplacement may often be more profitable, especially where there\r\nis reasonable safety against recurring fire.\r\n\r\nA thing to be borne in mind is that white pine seems to reach a\r\nhealthier and better development when mixed with a small proportion\r\nof other species, such as cedar, tamarack, spruce, lodgepole pine\r\nand Douglas fir, so there is no object in trying to produce an\r\nabsolutely pure stand. Some authorities think that 60 per cent\r\nof pine, with the rest helping to prune it, is an ideal mixture.\r\n\r\nLODGEPOLE PINE (_P. Murrayana_)\r\n\r\nPresent interest in private reproduction of this species hardly\r\nwarrants treating it at length in this publication, although\r\nunquestionably it will eventually occupy a higher place in the\r\nmarket than at present and its readiness to seize burned land in\r\nmany regions will make it a factor whether desired or not. Where\r\nyellow pine will grow, the problem is most likely to be to discourage\r\nlodgepole competition.\r\n\r\nIn strictly lodgepole territory, however, it may be the only promise\r\nof a new forest. Generally speaking, an even-aged growth should\r\nbe induced by clean cutting if the entire crop can be utilized.\r\nSlash burning in such cases is desirable. The chief difficulty\r\nis in providing seed supply, for either individual seed trees or\r\nsmall groups are almost certain to be blown down. Experiments so\r\nfar indicate that heavy strips must be spared, chosen to afford\r\nthe least present loss and safeguarded by fire lines.\r\n\r\nIn some lodgepole stands, especially where only certain sizes are\r\nmarketable, the cutting practically amounts to thinning. Here obviously\r\nthe effort should be to prevent over-thinning and to remove debris\r\nwith the least damage to the remaining stand. Piling and burning\r\nis essential.\r\n\r\nSUGAR PINE (_P. Lambertiana_)\r\n\r\nThis extremely valuable pine, commercially limited to the Oregon and\r\nCalifornia mountains, is fastidious in its choice of conditions. Not\r\na frequent or prolific seed bearer, it still insists on a moist loose\r\nseed-bed and prefers the natural forest floor to burned-over land. It\r\ncannot stand drought when young and except on cool northern slopes\r\nseedlings may be killed or stunted by exposure to full sunlight. On\r\nthe contrary it demands more and more light as it grows older and\r\nwill be suppressed or killed if unable to secure it. Under natural\r\nconditions it perpetuates itself best by filling open places in\r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\nFor the above reasons, sugar pine is naturally a component of mixed\r\nforests and it is doubtful whether it will be successfully grown as\r\na pure stand. Unfortunately, also, logging methods which are both\r\nthe simplest and most favorable to the reproduction of its associates\r\nmay be discouraging to sugar pine reproduction. Nevertheless, its\r\nvalue warrants strong efforts to favor it and is an argument, where\r\nconsiderable young sugar pine exists, against either clean cutting\r\nor the use of fire.\r\n\r\nThe Forest Service, for which authority much of the above discussion\r\nof this species was taken, offers the following general outline\r\nfor management in California:\r\n\r\n\"Since the forests in which sugar and yellow pine occur vary greatly\r\nin composition, the method of treatment must also vary. For this\r\nthe forest types already distinguished may form a basis.\r\n\r\n\"On the lower portion of the sugar pine-yellow pine type, where\r\nsugar pine forms but a small proportion of the stand, only the yellow\r\npine should be considered for the future forest. All merchantable\r\nsugar pine may therefore be removed. It will be necessary to leave\r\nonly a few seed trees of yellow pine to restock the ground, although\r\nusually it will be a wiser policy to leave a fair stand, since\r\nthis can be removed as a second cutting when reproduction is\r\nestablished. This procedure would also hold for areas on which yellow\r\npine occurs in nearly pure stands. In these localities dense stands\r\nof second-growth yellow pine occur. It will often be profitable,\r\nwhere there is a market at hand, to thin these stands when they\r\nare about 30 years old, removing the suppressed trees for mine\r\nprops. Trees 6, 8 and 10 inches and up are used for this purpose,\r\nand sell for from 5 to 6 cents a running foot.\r\n\r\n\"On the upper portion of the sugar pine-yellow pine type, where\r\nboth species have about an equal representation in the stand, seed\r\ntrees of each should be left, wherever practicable, in the proportion\r\nof two sugar pines to one yellow pine.\"\r\n\r\nIn the fir belt, where sugar pine and fir are the principal species,\r\nthe fir should be cut clean wherever possible and sugar pine should\r\nbe relied upon for the future forest.\r\n\r\n\"On all lands, the Douglas spruce, white fir and incense cedar\r\nshould be cut whenever possible, and chutes, skidways and bridges\r\nshould be constructed from the two last named species.\"\r\n\r\nThe following specific instructions are issued for marking timber\r\non National Forest sales in the sugar pine-yellow pine type:\r\n\r\n\"Owing to the large size of the trees, marking in this type of\r\nforest should be done with special care, since a slight mistake\r\ninvolves a comparatively large amount of timber.\r\n\r\n\"On nearly all of the lands included in this type the ground is\r\nnow but partly and insufficiently stocked with young timber, the\r\nareas of forest are constantly becoming more accessible to markets,\r\nand there is every indication of a strong future demand at greatly\r\nincreased prices. On nearly every tract, a second cut can be made\r\nwithin thirty years. All marking under present sales should be\r\ndone strictly with reference to two points:\r\n\r\n\"1. Stocking the cut-over land as fully as possible with sugar and\r\nyellow pine.\r\n\r\n\"2. Securing a second cut within thirty years.\r\n\r\n\"All cutting should be done under the 'selection system,' which\r\nrequires a careful choice of the individual trees to be removed.\r\nFixed diameter limits and the leaving of any specified number of\r\nseed trees per acre can be very largely disregarded.\r\n\r\n\"The condition of every sugar and yellow pine on the sale area\r\nshould be studied closely to determine whether that tree will be\r\nmerchantable thirty years hence, by which time a second cut is\r\nprobable. As a rule the trees which will remain merchantable for\r\nanother thirty years should be left. Suppressed and crowded trees\r\nwhich cannot develop should be removed. Under this system of marking,\r\nordinarily about one-half of the present stand of merchantable\r\npine would be left uncut. Will it pay?\r\n\r\n\"On areas where practically all of the pine is over-matured and\r\nwould be cut under the rule given above, a sufficient stand must be\r\nleft to reseed thoroughly the cut-over land. This requires not less\r\nthan four full seed-bearing trees, at least 25 inches in diameter,\r\nper acre. The strongest and thriftiest trees available should be\r\nselected for this purpose, but not less than the number specified\r\nmust be left even if every tree will be a total loss before a second\r\ncut is possible.\r\n\r\n\"Extensive areas of pine timber which are not yet fully mature\r\nshould be excluded from the sale. On patches or small areas of\r\nimmature pine, which it is not practicable to exclude from the\r\nsale, cutting should be very light, limited to one-third or less\r\nof the largest trees, or omitted altogether.\r\n\r\n\"No attempt to discriminate sharply between sugar and yellow pine\r\nshould be made, as both trees are almost equally desirable. Where a\r\nchoice is necessary, sugar pine should be favored on moist situations,\r\nas in canyons, moist pockets, or benches and on northerly exposures.\r\nYellow pine should be favored on dry situations, including exposed\r\nridges and southern exposures.\r\n\r\n\"Fir and incense cedar should be marked, as a rule, to as low a\r\ndiameter as these trees are merchantable in order to reduce the\r\nproportion of these species in coming reproduction. It is essential,\r\nhowever, that no large openings be made in the present stand since\r\nthe exposed ground is in danger of reverting to chaparral or of\r\nbecoming so dry from evaporation that no reproduction will follow\r\ncutting. Where the stand of pine is insufficient to reseed thoroughly\r\nand protect the cut-over area, enough sound, thrifty fir and cedar\r\nshould be left to form a fairly even cover with openings less than\r\na quarter of an acre in size.'\"\r\n\r\nThe under current of all opinion upon sugar pine up to date is\r\nthat reproduction will not be very successful unless enough growth\r\nto shelter the seedlings remains after logging. Where the fire\r\nrisk permits, the same end may be furthered by leaving the tops\r\nscattered on the ground.\r\n\r\nLittle experimenting has been done in planting sugar pine, but\r\nthere are many indications that except where conditions strongly\r\nfavor natural reproduction it will be resorted to eventually if\r\nany particular attempt is made to get this species. Leaving large\r\nseed trees is not only expensive, but rather uncertain, because\r\nheavy seed years are several years apart and squirrels consume a\r\nlarge portion of an ordinary crop. Transplants which have received\r\nnursery shelter until past the greatest danger of drying out should\r\nprove most successful on heavily-cut south slopes.\r\n\r\nREDWOOD (_Sequoia sempervirens_)\r\n\r\nAlthough probably the most rapid-growing of all American commercial\r\ntrees and also of high market standing, redwood has been little\r\nstudied by foresters. The layman is still more confused by its many\r\npeculiarities. Growing to a size of 20 feet in diameter and 350 feet\r\nhigh, reaching an age of well over 1,000 years and seldom reproducing\r\nby means of seed, it is not surprising that it was long regarded\r\nas ill-adapted to second crop management. Although observing that\r\nsuckers sprout from the stumps with great rapidity, the lumberman\r\ngenerally regarded these mushroom growths as abnormal and temporary,\r\nand believed his virgin timber to be the finally-vanishing remnant\r\nof a prehistoric species unsuited to present-day conditions.\r\n\r\nIt was next discovered that the suckering habit is no new one,\r\nindeed that the majority of the present stand, however old, began\r\nas sprouts from roots or stumps of its predecessors. This is evident\r\nfrom the circular arrangement of several trees around the spot where\r\ntheir parent stood. These old sprouts were of very slow growth,\r\nfor they were shaded by a forest of extreme density. As seedlings\r\nthey could have neither germinated nor grown, but as suckers they\r\nwere kept alive by the parent until light supply became available\r\nthrough their increasing height or through thinning of the forest.\r\nUnder such conditions centuries were required to produce large\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe owner of today, by cutting down the old stand, gives the suckers\r\nconditions hitherto unknown to the redwood. The vigor and susceptibility\r\nto the aid of light, which originally was necessary in the sprout\r\ngrowth to perpetuate the species at all, now respond to entire\r\nfreedom and light in an astonishing manner. Even after severe slashing\r\nfires char the stumps, the latter throw out clusters of sprouts\r\nwhich grow several feet a year. Logging works 30 or 40 years old\r\nhave come up to trees nearly 100 feet high. Naturally such timber\r\nhas a heavy percentage of sapwood and is soft and brittle, but\r\nit is already suitable for piling, box lumber and like purposes\r\nand improves constantly.\r\n\r\nSince reproduction by seed does not enter into the problem, financial\r\npossibilities depend almost wholly on the nature of the original\r\nstand. There are many types of redwood forest, pure and mixed,\r\nflat and slope. If the old trees are few to the acre, the sprout\r\nclusters will be so far apart that excess of side light will produce\r\nclumps of swell-butted, short limby trees, of little use for lumber;\r\nthat is, unless there is also a seedling growth of fir or other\r\nspecies to fill the blanks and bring up the density. Where such a\r\nnurse growth is to be counted on, or where the redwood trees are\r\nsmall and close together, ideal conditions for a certain, rapid\r\nand well formed second crop exist.\r\n\r\nThe thinner the original redwood stand, the greater the effort\r\nnecessary at the time of logging to obtain the required density. The\r\nleaving of seed trees of other species, with as many as possible small\r\ntrees of both redwood and other species and the maximum protection\r\nof all from fire, should then be the means employed. On some tracts\r\nthe proportion of redwood will not warrant this effort; on some\r\nit is not even required. The question of whether it pays to hold\r\nredwood land is therefore almost wholly local, but when conditions\r\nare favorable it can be answered affirmatively, because of the\r\nextremely rapid growth, with less doubt than of almost any other\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThere is some tendency to over-production of sprouts by redwood\r\nstumps. Removal of the excess with an ax, saving those closest\r\nto the ground and not over-thinning to the extent of reducing the\r\ndensity conducive to height growth and shedding of low branches,\r\nimproves the chances of those remaining.\r\n\r\nSEEDING AND PLANTING\r\n\r\nSEED SUPPLY\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in a previous chapter that the owner of deforested\r\nland who desires to secure a second crop may find it necessary or\r\ncheaper to adopt artificial measures wholly or in part instead\r\nof depending upon natural reproduction. These measures may be of\r\ntwo kinds--direct seeding, in which the seed is sown where the\r\ntrees are to stand permanently, and the planting of trees grown\r\nin nurseries.\r\n\r\nWhether artificial reforestation is accomplished by means of sowing\r\nseed or planting trees, the first requisite is a supply of tree seed\r\nof the desired species and of good quality. Unfortunately for the\r\ntimber owner who wishes to enter upon extensive seeding operations,\r\nthe business of collecting and preparing forest tree seed for market\r\nhas received but little attention from old-established seed firms,\r\nand it is not always possible to purchase the species and quantity\r\ndesired. Moreover, the prices charged are often excessive.\r\n\r\nIn the Pacific Northwest, however, the demand for seed of Douglas\r\nfir and Sitka spruce has led to the establishment of a considerable\r\ntrade in these species, and at reasonable prices, so that where\r\nthese species are to be used, or only small quantities of other\r\nspecies, the timber owner will probably find it to his advantage\r\nto purchase the seed rather than to attempt collecting it himself.\r\nDouglas fir seed is quoted at $1.40 to $2.00 per pound and Sitka\r\nspruce seed at $2.25 to $3.00.\r\n\r\nIn purchasing seed it is common practice to specify that it shall\r\nbe of the new crop, because tree seed kept in ordinary storage\r\nloses its vitality materially. When properly stored in air-tight\r\nreceptacles, however, as is now done by some seed dealers, it will\r\nretain its germinative power for several years with only slight\r\ndepreciation. Moreover, fresh seed, if improperly treated, may\r\nbe of very poor quality, so that the age of the seed is of little\r\nvalue in the determination of its worth and the only sure method\r\nof ascertaining this is by means of germination or cutting tests.\r\nThe latter method is the quickest and most simple and consists\r\nof cutting open a number of the seeds and ascertaining the per\r\ncent whose kernel is sound, plump and moist. Seed of good average\r\nquality should contain not more than 25-30 per cent of infertile\r\nseed.\r\n\r\nWhen seed cannot be purchased, it is necessary to collect. Since\r\nno species of coniferous trees bear abundant crops of seed each\r\nyear and often several seasons will elapse between good crops, it\r\nis necessary to gather sufficient seed when the supply is abundant\r\nto provide for succeeding years when the crop is apt to be a failure.\r\n\r\nThe seed ripens in the fall, usually during August or September,\r\nand the cones should be collected at that time. Pines require two\r\nyears in which to mature the seed; that is, the cones are not fully\r\nformed and the seed ripe until the second fall after the fertilization\r\nof the flowers in the spring. Most of the other important conifers\r\nripen their seed in the fall of the same season. Shortly after\r\nthe seed is ripe, the cones open and allow it to disseminate,\r\nconsequently they must be gathered before this occurs.\r\n\r\nThe cones are gathered either by climbing the trees and cutting\r\nthem off from the branches, by picking from the tops of felled\r\ntrees, or by robbing squirrels' hoards. Where squirrels are abundant\r\nin the forest, the last method is the cheapest. Climbing trees\r\nis practiced only where the trees are small. When this method is\r\nemployed, the workmen should be equipped with linemen's belts and\r\nclimbers. Picking from felled trees is readily carried on except\r\nwhere dense underbrush interferes, as is the case in the ordinary\r\nDouglas fir forest.\r\n\r\nTrees growing in the open, with large crowns extending down the\r\ngreater part of the bole, bear cones more abundantly than trees\r\nin dense forests, and for this reason collecting from scattered\r\nopen growths can be done more cheaply than on logging areas. Often\r\nlarge quantities of cones can be purchased from settlers who will\r\ncollect and deliver them at central points at a stipulated price.\r\nWhen this method is employed, however, frequent examination of\r\nthe cones should be made to ascertain that they contain the full\r\nnumber of seed, for often opened cones from which a part or all\r\nof the seed has been disseminated will be offered for sale. Insect\r\nlarvæ also often destroy a large proportion of the seed, particularly\r\nwhen the crop is light and care should be taken that the cones\r\npurchased are not infested. The prices paid for cones vary from\r\n25 cents to 50 cents per sack for the larger cones, like yellow\r\nand white pine, and 50 cents to $1.00 for Douglas fir and spruce,\r\ndepending upon the abundance of the crop.\r\n\r\nAfter the cones are gathered the seed must be extracted and cleaned.\r\nWhere climatic conditions in the fall of the year will permit\r\nair-drying, the cones may be spread out on sheets or blankets where\r\nthey will be exposed to the sun and wind. Under this treatment\r\nthey will open in from 3 to 6 days, depending upon the weather\r\nand the species. Where bad weather will interfere with air-drying,\r\nthe cones must be dried undercover by artificial heat. This is the\r\nmethod usually employed by professional seed collectors, and where\r\nlarge quantities of cones are to be treated each year special dry\r\nhouses are constructed and fitted with elaborate drying apparatus.\r\nThe work can be done most cheaply with such an establishment, but\r\nfor the ordinary timber owner who expects to collect seed only\r\noccasionally, a makeshift dry-house which will answer the purpose\r\ncan be fitted up inexpensively in any unused building. The essential\r\nfeatures are shelves or trays 4 feet wide arranged around the walls\r\nof the room, one above the other and separated about 8 inches apart,\r\nand a heating stove placed in the center of the room. The shelves\r\nmay be made of burlap stretched tight, or, better still, of wire\r\nscreening of 1-1/2 inch or 3/4-inch mesh.\r\n\r\nAfter being subjected to a temperature not exceeding 110° Fahr.\r\nfor from 24 to 48 hours, the cones will open, allowing the seed to\r\nfall out when shaken or pounded. The seed when separated from the\r\ncones is then mixed with a coarse gravel in about the proportion\r\nof 4 to 1 and churned to remove the wings. Finally, all foreign\r\nmatter is removed by screening and hollow seed blown out by passing\r\nit through an ordinary fanning mill.\r\n\r\nSEEDING VERSUS PLANTING\r\n\r\nThe selection of the method of reforestation to employ, whether\r\ndirect seeding or planting, depends primarily upon the character\r\nof the area to be restocked. Direct seeding is usually considerably\r\ncheaper when the results are satisfactory, but only on the more\r\nfavorable sites where moisture and soil conditions are right is\r\nthere any assurance of success. Even in such cases partial or total\r\ndestruction of the seed often results from birds and rodents. In\r\nexposed situations where the soil is shallow, or where because of\r\nclimatic conditions soil dries out several inches deep during the\r\ngrowing season, the seed may not germinate at all, or the young\r\nseedlings may be killed before they have time to send their roots\r\ndown to the permanent moisture level. In such situations, planting\r\nis the only reliable method. If the plant material is of the proper\r\nkind and the work well done, satisfactory results are almost certain\r\nto follow. Direct seeding is a much more rapid method than planting,\r\nand where extensive areas are to be restocked within a short period\r\nand seed is abundant, the work can be completed quickly. On the other\r\nhand, this method is wasteful of seed because a large proportion\r\nfails to germinate and the young seedlings often succumb to adverse\r\nconditions, so that where seed is scarce or its cost high, planting\r\nis the more practical method.\r\n\r\nBecause planting is the most reliable method it has been the one\r\nmost largely employed in extensive operations, both here and in\r\nmost European counties, but thorough tests are now being made of\r\ndirect seeding and under proper conditions it promises to be fairly\r\nsatisfactory. The Douglas fir region west of the Cascade Mountains\r\noffers the most favorable conditions for direct seeding and except\r\non badly exposed south slopes, or where the growth of brush is\r\nexceedingly dense, it is believed this method will prove a satisfactory\r\none for the timber owner to employ.\r\n\r\nIn the yellow pine regions conditions are not so satisfactory for\r\ndirect seeding, since this tree occurs largely in a region of deficient\r\nrainfall. However, natural reproduction is abundant throughout\r\nmany portions of this type, and it is probable that direct seeding\r\nwill prove fairly successful if the proper methods are employed\r\nand if forest conditions have not been too greatly disturbed. That\r\nsome method of successfully employing direct seeding with yellow\r\npine be found is greatly to be desired, since yellow pine seedlings\r\ndo not withstand transplanting well, but there is need for careful\r\nexperimentation before extensive seeding operations in this type\r\nby private timber owners would be justifiable.\r\n\r\nWestern white pine, it is believed, will be easy to reproduce in\r\nmost of its native situations by direct seeding, though the greater\r\nscarcity of its seed and the fact that it will be more subject to\r\ndestruction by birds and rodents because of its larger size may\r\nmake planting the more practical method.\r\n\r\nTrees for planting can either be purchased from commercial nurserymen\r\nor grown in nurseries established for that purpose near the planting\r\nsite. When only a few thousand trees are needed it is cheaper to\r\npurchase them, but when extensive operations are contemplated,\r\ncovering hundreds of acres in which millions of trees will be needed,\r\nit is far preferable for the owner to grow the trees in his own\r\nnursery. Some initial outlay for the establishment of the nursery\r\nwill be necessary and a practical nurseryman should be employed,\r\nbut the saving in the cost of the trees will fully compensate for\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nOne, two and three year old trees, the latter once transplanted,\r\nare usually employed in planting, the older trees being used for\r\nthe less favorable sites. In planting they are placed in rows\r\nequidistant apart, the spacing varying from 4 to 12 feet, with a\r\ngeneral average of about 6 feet. The work may be done either in\r\nthe fall after growth has ceased or in the spring before growth\r\ncommences.\r\n\r\nThe cost of planting, of course, will vary greatly with the age of\r\nthe trees, the number planted per acre and the accessibility and\r\ncharacter of the planting site. With young trees and wide spacing,\r\nthe cost may be as low as $6.00 per acre, while in more unfavorable\r\nsituations where older plants are used and planting is more laborious\r\nit may be as high as $16.00. A fair average, however, for those\r\nareas which a timber owner would be most likely to plant up is\r\nabout $8.00 to $10.00 per acre.\r\n\r\nIn direct seeding, several different methods may be employed, such\r\nas broadcasting over the entire area with or without previous\r\npreparation of the soil, sowing in strips, or sowing in seed spots;\r\nbut observation and experiment have shown that it is necessary for\r\nseed such as Douglas fir, yellow pine and western white pine to\r\ncome in close contact with the mineral soil in order that it may\r\ngerminate and the seedlings live; consequently only those methods\r\nshould be used which will accomplish this. Where the area has been\r\nburned over previous to sowing and the mineral soil laid bare,\r\nbroadcast seeding may be employed. Where the ground will permit\r\nthe use of a harrow good results are obtainable by scarifying the\r\nsoil in strips about 10 feet apart and sowing the seed in these\r\nstrips. On unburned areas covered with a dense growth of fern,\r\nsalal, moss, grass, or other plants, this covering must be removed\r\nby the seed spot method. This consists in removing the ground cover\r\nwith a grub hoe or mattock in spots of varying diameter (6 inches to\r\n3 feet) and of various distances apart (6 to 15 feet), and sowing\r\nthe seed in these spots. The advantages of this method are that\r\na minimum amount of seed is used; the ground can be prepared and\r\nthe seed covered to whatever extent is desirable, and the soil\r\npressed down. This method is believed to be the one best suited\r\nto the greatest variety of sites.\r\n\r\nThe amount of seed used per acre will, of course, vary with the\r\nspecies and the method used, and the quality of the seed. The following\r\ntable indicates the approximate quantity of seed of good average\r\nquality required per acre for three different methods, the average\r\ncost when collected in fairly large quantities, and the number\r\nof seed per pound:\r\n\r\n                                           No. pounds required per acre.\r\n                   No. seed  Cost per  Broadcast,                 Seedspots\r\n    Species.        per lb.   pound.  entire area.

Simple broadcasting without any preparation or treatment\r\nof the soil will not exceed 20 cents to 25 cents per acre for labor;\r\nharrowing and sowing in strips, 85 cents to $1.10 per acre, and\r\nsowing in seedspots, $2.00 to $5.00 per acre. Upon this basis the\r\ntotal cost per acre will approximate the figures given in the table\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\n                    Broadcast over                Seedspots,\r\n    Species.         entire area.

Future stumpage value, tax burden and fire\r\nrisk are all subject to uncertain influences, but the approximate\r\nyield of a given species under given natural conditions will be\r\nthe same in the future that it is now. To predict it requires only\r\nstudy of existing stands without being misled by the influence\r\nof conditions which will not be repeated.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, an immense amount of misinformation is circulated\r\nbecause of superficial observation. Enthusiasts discovering individual\r\ntrees which have made prodigious growth, or even fairly extensive\r\nstands on fertile soil with heavy rainfall, will compute sawlog\r\nyields at 40 or 50 years which are much too optimistic for general\r\napplication. Others, remembering some stand they have seen in\r\nunfavorable localities, or noting shade-suppressed trees which\r\nwill not be paralleled after the virgin forest is removed, are\r\nunduly discouraged. It is most essential that yield tables be made\r\nby trained observers who know how to reach the true average, and\r\nthat the figures either actually come from the region to which they\r\nare to be applied or are accompanied by a systematic analysis of\r\nclimatic and other conditions which permits intelligent comparison.\r\n\r\nIn calculating another yield on cut-over land, the system for an\r\neven-aged new growth, such as will follow clean cutting of Douglas\r\nfir, for example, is quite different from that necessary if the\r\ncutting amounts only to selection of the merchantable trees and\r\nleaves a fair stand of smaller ones. In the latter case, yield\r\ntables based on average acreage production are of little use because\r\nso much depends upon the character of the stand which remains on\r\nthe tract in question. Here the basis must be the rate of growth\r\nof the average individual tree. An estimate by the number in each\r\npresent diameter class may be made of the trees which will escape\r\nlogging, showing, let us say for example, about five trees of each\r\ndiameter from 6 to 12 inches, or thirty-five in all which are over\r\n6 inches. If the growth study indicates that in 20 years there will\r\nhave been added 6 inches in diameter we can estimate a crop of\r\nfive trees each of classes extending from 12 to 18 inches. Actually\r\nthe process will not be so simple, for the different aged trees\r\nwill not grow with equal rapidity, and several other factors must\r\nbe reckoned with, but the general principle is to apply rate of\r\ngrowth knowledge to the material on hand, and study of this material\r\nis essential.\r\n\r\nFor predicting even-aged crops resulting from entire restocking,\r\nthe acquisition of necessary basic information is as difficult, or\r\nmore so, but its application is far simpler. That the ground will\r\nbe fully stocked by natural or artificial means must be assumed,\r\nbut we can also assume that the result will be influenced only by\r\nnormal locality conditions and not by accidental condition of the\r\npresent forest. Therefore we use a yield table and not a growth\r\ntable. This can be made by actual measurement of existing second\r\ngrowth stands of different ages, which proves not only the growth\r\nrate but also the number of trees which the natural shade-thinning\r\nprocess results in at different periods of the forest life. The\r\nchief danger of inaccuracy in such information lies in basing it on\r\ninsufficient measurements or in applying it where soil or moisture\r\nconditions are greatly different. The latter error can be guarded\r\nagainst, however, by use of growth figures taken in conjunction\r\nwith it. For example, if a yield table showing 25,000 feet to the\r\nacre at 50 years from seed is accompanied by one showing that the\r\naverage stand it represents is 125 high at 50 years and its average\r\n50-year-tree is 14 inches in diameter, little investigation is\r\nnecessary to determine whether in any given locality the growth\r\nfalls far above or below that.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to reproduce here any considerable number of growth\r\nand yield tables would be of doubtful use without more space than\r\nis allowed to explain how they are made and used. There are many\r\ntechnicalities, both mathematical and silvicultural, and unfortunately\r\nmost of the available figures for the Northwest, obtained by the\r\nForest Service, have not been generalized enough for wide popular\r\nvalue. This is particularly true of yield tables which necessarily\r\nrequire assuming standards of merchantability. While the best western\r\nwhite pine table assumes that by the time a new crop is cut 7-inch\r\nwhite pine will be salable, the best fir table was worked upon\r\na 12-inch diameter basis. Obviously this would show an unfairly\r\ngreater yield of a pine forest containing trees between 7 and 12\r\ninches and be very misleading in calculating financial results at\r\nthe same age and stumpage rates; yet without the original data\r\nthere is no way of reducing both tables to the same basis. As an\r\nexample, however, to indicate how the financial possibilities of\r\nsecond growth can be arrived at if a systematic study is made,\r\nlet us take the Douglas fir figures referred to.\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS FIR\r\n\r\nThese are exceedingly reliable. Measurements were taken by the Forest\r\nService of practically pure fir on about 400 areas in thirty-five\r\ndifferent age stands from 10 to 140 years old, ranging along the\r\nwestern Cascade foothills from the Canadian line to central Oregon.\r\nSince reforestation investment is likely to be confined mainly to\r\nthe more promising opportunities, only such growth was measured\r\nas gave an average representation of the better class of the two\r\nshould all the general territory covered be graded in two quality\r\nclasses of all around ability to produce forests. On the other\r\nhand, care was taken not to represent the maximum of the better\r\nclass, data being taken only from permanent forest land and not\r\nfrom rich potential agricultural land which might show unfairly\r\nrapid forest growth. The average areas were actually measured and\r\nthe number, age, form, diameter growth, height growth, board foot\r\ncontents, etc., of all the trees on them were accurately determined.\r\nTrees 12 inches in diameter 4-1/2 feet from the ground were considered\r\nmerchantable, and it was assumed they could be used to 8 inches in\r\nthe top. From this data were prepared tables and diagrams showing\r\nthe average development of trees and stands under fairly favorable\r\nconditions in the region west of the Cascades.\r\n\r\nThis gave the following yield per acre:\r\n\r\nAge of Stand.    Feet, B. M.    Age of Stand.    Feet, B. M.\r\n     40            12,400            90             70,200\r\n     50            28,000           100             79,800\r\n     60            41,000           110             90,300\r\n     70            51,700           120            101,500\r\n     80            61,100           130            113,000\r\n\r\nLet us see how these figures can be used in answering the primary\r\nquestion of the prospective timber-grower: \"Will it pay to hold\r\nmy cut-over land for a second crop?\"\r\n\r\nObviously no certain answer can be printed here, not only because\r\nno uniform stumpage prices or carrying charges can be predicted but\r\nalso because individuals may differ as to what profit is necessary\r\nto make the investment \"pay,\" so it will be necessary to analyze\r\nthe situation so each may select the premises which suit his own\r\ncase and judgment. The investment made by the holder of cut-over\r\nland is of two kinds; that represented by the land which otherwise\r\nhe might sell, putting the proceeds at work in some other business,\r\nand the annual carrying charges which otherwise he might also invest\r\ndifferently. The sum obtainable by investing the money available\r\nby sale after logging, adding to it yearly the sum required for\r\nfire prevention and taxes, and compounding both at a satisfactory\r\ninterest for the entire period, is practically the cost of holding\r\nthe tract for any given number of years. By calculating this cost\r\nupon a basis of one acre, and dividing it by the yield board measure\r\nwhich the same period will produce, the cost per thousand feet of\r\ngrowing a second crop is arrived at.\r\n\r\nAgainst this may be set the gross return from the same expected\r\nyield at any given stumpage rate. The yield at the end of a 50-year\r\ninvestment will not be that of a 50-year forest, however, for although\r\nthe carrying cost begins at once, the new forest requires a few\r\nyears to become established. No exact figure can be set for this,\r\nfor some seed will sprout the first year and some blank spaces may\r\npersist several years, but in the tables to follow five years has\r\nbeen allowed for an average. Consequently, instead of calculating\r\non a 28 M yield as the return at the end of 50 years, as indicated\r\nin the yield table on the preceding page, the 45-year yield of\r\n20-1/2 M is used, and similarly for the other periods of 60, 70\r\nand 80 years. These four rotations only will be considered here,\r\nfor in less than 50 years second growth will probably be too small\r\nto be cut at the highest profit, while after 80 years the investment\r\ncompounds so heavily as to make it improbable that increasing stumpage\r\nvalues will compensate.\r\n\r\nThree interest rates have been used in the first table to follow:\r\n4, 5 and 6 per cent, compound. Forest calculations at lower rates\r\nare often seen, but it is not believed that less than 5 per cent\r\nwill be satisfactory to private owners and many will insist on 6\r\nper cent. The fair standard is what the owner can make in other\r\nbusiness today, and since he can reinvest his income in the same\r\nbusiness, it is reasonable to figure at a compound rate. A few\r\nexamples are given to show how similar calculations may be made\r\nwith any set of investment and stumpage factors which appeal to\r\nindividual judgment. The second table, prepared from the first,\r\nshows at a glance the price that must be received for Douglas fir\r\nto make it pay either 5 or 6 per cent compound interest under a\r\nrange of sixty different conditions of original investment and\r\nannual cost.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that, although present land value is\r\nmade a charge, the value of the land at the time of harvest is\r\nnot considered. This value is certain to increase greatly in the\r\nlong periods involved. Taxation charges will be against it as well\r\nas against the timber. Indeed much land is now held without any\r\nregard to possible second growth.

The rate of interest demanded of the investment is one of the\r\nmost important factors. This is because such long terms are involved.\r\nThe charges compound with prodigious rapidity toward the last.\r\nIn any other business paying 6 per cent, compound, the maximum\r\ninvestment per acre given in the preceding table, that of a land\r\nvalue of $7.50 and a 30-cent annual charge for 80 years, would\r\nearn $1,317. A 75-year forest then harvestable should have 56-1/2\r\nM to the acre, but this would have to bring over $25 per M to pay\r\nas well. On the other hand, the same deposits earning 4 per cent\r\nwould only amount to $338 in the same period which would be equaled\r\nby timber at $6 per M.\r\n\r\n2. For similar reasons, the length of time before cutting has much\r\nto do with profit or loss. The compounding of carrying charges\r\neventually outstrips the production of material to a degree which\r\ncan be offset only by the most rapid rise of stumpage values.\r\n\r\n3. The greater the investment, the more marked the above effect and\r\nconsequently the tendency to market an inferior product. A 60-year\r\nrotation is indicated by a majority of the conditions shown.\r\n\r\n4. A comparatively slight increase in annual tax or fire charges\r\nmay make the difference between profit and loss. Roughly, stumpage\r\nmust bring $1 per M more to compensate for each 10 cents an acre\r\nfor taxes at 5 per cent or for 7 cents at 6 per cent.\r\n\r\n5. If the land is salable for $5 an acre or more it cannot be made to\r\npay 6 per cent compound interest under the most favorable conditions,\r\nunless the stumpage received exceeds $6. At $5 stumpage and with\r\nreasonable taxation it will pay 5 per cent if it escapes fire.\r\n\r\n6. Thirty cents an acre is apparently about the maximum annual\r\ncarrying charge which will permit a 6 per cent profit, even with\r\nvery high stumpage prices. Consequently, while present taxes on\r\ncut-over land are seldom prohibitive, there must be reasonable\r\ncertainty that excessive increase will not occur.\r\n\r\nThe carrying charges shown in the second table cover both fire\r\nprotection and taxes, as by reading the 15-cent line to include a\r\n10-cent tax and a 5-cent fire patrol. The investment charge may be\r\nused to represent sale value only, or sale value plus any expense\r\nincurred at time of logging in order to secure reproduction, such as\r\nleaving salable material in seed trees, or planting. If desired, any\r\nowner may make a similar calculation on any other valuation better\r\nfitting his own situation. The table is not intended for universal\r\nuse but merely as an illustration of how forest calculations may\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nWHITE PINE\r\n\r\nToo much space would be required to give a similar table for all\r\nwestern species, even were as good yield figures available. Roughly\r\nspeaking, however, western white pine, under conditions thoroughly\r\nfavorable to it, may be expected to make as good a yield as Douglas\r\nfir, and the above fir table will not be far off for it. A probably\r\nhigher stumpage value should offset any lesser production.\r\n\r\nHEMLOCK\r\n\r\nWestern hemlock is of somewhat, but not much, slower growth when\r\ncoming in on open land as an even-aged stand. No yield table based\r\non the same merchantable standards as the fir table quoted has\r\nbeen prepared, but the following is fairly safe to include all\r\ntrees 14 inches in diameter used to 12 inches in the top: At 50\r\nyears, 2 M per acre; at 60 years, 22 M; at 70 years, 33 M; at 80\r\nyears, 40 M. The absence of a 40-year figure, and the sudden jump\r\nbetween 50 and 60 years, is because very few hemlock trees reach 14\r\ninches at 50 years, but a large number of 12 and 13-inch trees pass\r\ninto that class during the ten years following. Any yield figures\r\nfor an even-aged forest show a similar jump at the point where the\r\nstand as a whole reaches the determined minimum merchantable size.\r\nFor the same reason these hemlock figures are not very far less\r\npromising than those given for fir, for at corresponding ages the\r\nlatter include 12 and 13-inch trees and all trees are considered\r\nmerchantable to a top diameter of 8 inches.\r\n\r\nSPRUCE\r\n\r\nSince no systematic study of Sitka spruce second growth has been\r\nmade, it can only be predicted from knowledge of its habits that\r\nwhile in favorable situation it will yield as heavily as Douglas\r\nfir, in other localities its growth in early life is slower and\r\nless regular, making it less likely to produce a good crop before\r\nthe carrying charges become burdensome. If this proves true, taxation\r\nrates and land values will be extremely important factors, offset\r\nto some degree by a smaller fire hazard and the probability of\r\nhigh stumpage.\r\n\r\nREDWOOD\r\n\r\nFor redwood we also lack good figures for any considerable range of\r\nconditions and ages, for redwood growth which followed burns does\r\nnot exist and there are no very old cuttings. Government studies\r\non the northern California coast prove conclusively, however, that\r\nthis is our most rapid growing native commercial tree. In thirty\r\nyears, in fair soil, it will produce a tree of 16 inches diameter,\r\n80 feet high, and some existing 45-year stands run 20 to 30 inches\r\non the stump and about 100 feet high. Reckoning 14-inch trees as\r\nmerchantable, to be used to 10 inches in the tops, a 25 to 30-year\r\nsecond growth after logging near Crescent City was found to have\r\n2-1/2 M feet to the acre and the future increase should be very\r\nrapid. There is little question of the profit of growing redwood,\r\nprovided the difficulties described elsewhere of getting a dense\r\ncrop started are overcome.\r\n\r\nPROFITABLE THINNINGS\r\n\r\nIn addition to the yield of saw timber to be expected when the\r\nsecond crop reaches manufacturing size, there will be a market\r\nin many cases for material obtained by thinning. It is perfectly\r\nfair to compound for the remainder of the rotation any net profit\r\nso obtained and to set it against the carrying charges. In many\r\ncases it will go far to turn an apparently losing investment into\r\na very profitable one. Moreover, the proper thinning of growing\r\nstands not only utilizes material which would otherwise die and\r\nbe lost before the main harvest, but actually improves the quality\r\nof the first yield.\r\n\r\nIn obtaining the figures previously quoted the Forest Service found\r\nthat the average Douglas fir stand at 40 years contains 410 living\r\ntrees, most of them between 6 and 15 inches in diameter. At 60\r\nyears there are but 265 trees, 145 having died and decayed in the\r\n20-year interval which were suitable for ties or other small timber\r\nproducts. The remaining trees would have been improved by thinning\r\nto prevent this loss, for the greatest diameter growth is made\r\nwhen the stand is open, and the ideal is to have just the density\r\nwhich will get the greatest wood production and still result in\r\nproper pruning and clearing of the trees.\r\n\r\nCommenting along this line Mr. T. T. Munger, who conducted the\r\ninvestigation, says:\r\n\r\n\"That thinnings are silviculturally practicable and financially\r\nprofitable in the Pacific Northwest has been demonstrated. In the\r\nvicinity of Cottage Grove, Oregon, many fully stocked even-aged\r\nDouglas fir stands now about 50 years old, most of them forming\r\na part of ranches. Many of these stands have been cut over in the\r\nlast 10 years and all the material then large enough for piling or\r\nmine timber cut out. This removed about 20 per cent of the stand.\r\nAt the present time many of these same stands now contain much\r\nmaterial valuable for small piles, ties and mine timber, yet the\r\ncrown canopy is as dense and the trees as close and fine quality\r\nas though no cutting had ever been done in the stand. In fact,\r\nsome of the 50-year old stands have already been cut over a second\r\ntime, and each time with decided profit to the owner and no damage\r\nto the forest. From one 10-acre block of second growth now 50 years\r\nold, situated 7 miles from the railroad, already 32,000 feet of\r\nmining timber and about 100 50-foot piles have been taken out,\r\nyet the stand is now in good condition, and in a few years more of\r\nthe smaller trees can be removed without infringing on the yield\r\nof the final crop. The material from these thinnings was worth at\r\nthe railroad about $80 per acre.\"\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThroughout the preceding pages on the financial promise of\r\ntimber-growing in the West, the attempt has been not to give conclusions\r\nbut to state certain known facts regarding tree growth and indicate\r\nhow these may be used in arriving at conclusions based largely\r\nupon the conditions and judgment of the individual owner. In many\r\ncases they will do little more than suggest further investigation\r\nnecessary. The Western Forestry & Conservation Association and,\r\ndoubtless, the District Foresters for the Forest Service, will\r\nbe glad to discuss such work and assist if possible.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, several conservative deductions to be made:\r\n\r\n1. The Pacific coast states contain large areas having species\r\nand climatic conditions peculiarly favorable for forest-growing\r\nas a business. The rapidity and quantity of yield insure profit\r\nunder conditions which would be prohibitive elsewhere.\r\n\r\n2. In many cases, perhaps in most, a second crop can be started\r\nwith little initial expense.\r\n\r\n3. There is much land of no value for any other purpose.\r\n\r\n4. Even if the owner does not care to hold his land long enough for\r\nanother crop, or if he is prevented from doing so at some future\r\ntime by excessive taxation or other prohibition, its disposal value\r\nwill be greater if it bears young forest growth than if it does\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n5. Stumpage values are certain to advance greatly and their advance\r\nwill be governed largely by these factors:\r\n\r\na. Speculative influence necessarily accompanying the lessening\r\nof the nation's and the world's timber supply.\r\n\r\nb. The carrying charges of fire prevention and taxation imposed\r\nby the community upon virgin timber, which, since they represent\r\nan investment which must be recouped, will either be added in the\r\nlong run to the price of stumpage exactly in the measure of their\r\nseverity and so transferred to the consumer, or result in rapid\r\ncutting and consequently raise the speculative value of that which\r\nescapes cutting. (This the consumer will pay also.)\r\n\r\nc. The quantity of new timber grown.\r\n\r\n6. It is probable that future demand for timber will reimburse the\r\ncost of growing it, be this cost high or low _within reasonable\r\nlimits_.\r\n\r\n7. This does not mean, however, that the timberland owner will or\r\ncan generally engage in the business when the cost is excessive.\r\nWhile he could probably make a good profit eventually, such an\r\ninvestment is too heavy and prolonged to be inviting; besides there\r\nis the possibility of entire loss by fire. He will naturally compare\r\nit with other investments having less disadvantages. For example,\r\nsince conditions which discourage the growing of new competing\r\nforests tend for this very reason to enhance the value of existing\r\nforests, he might invest further in the latter instead, with equal\r\nultimate profit and with easier access to his money at any time.\r\n\r\n8. Consequently the growing of timber is promising to the private\r\nowner only when the investment can be borne easily. Since it has\r\nthree forms--land value, fire protection, and taxation--all must\r\nbe moderate or, if one or more is high, the rest must be low.\r\n\r\n9. With the fire hazard great at present, and taxation so uncertain\r\nas to require allowing for its being excessive, the initial investment\r\nmust be insignificant.\r\n\r\n10. This confines it to land of low sale value and precludes much\r\nexpense to insure the second crop.\r\n\r\n11. To secure the perpetuation of forests on the scale essential\r\nto public welfare, the public must provide the private owner better\r\nfire protection and an equitable taxation system. _Or else it must\r\npurchase sufficient cut-over land and engage in forestry itself,\r\nbearing the cost and taking the risk._\r\n\r\n12. Nevertheless there are several practical exceptions to the somewhat\r\nunfavorable situation theoretically outlined above:\r\n\r\n(a) Many owners are warranted in holding cut-over land for some\r\ntime, if not indefinitely, because of the upward trend of land\r\nvalues generally. Unless clearly most useful for agriculture, such\r\nland will be made more valuable by a growth of young timber. However\r\nindefinite the profit of encouraging this growth and protecting it\r\nfrom fire may be if the present sale value and taxes are computed\r\nagainst such outlay, _the two latter charges are being carried\r\nanyway_ and are the most important ones. Merely that it cannot\r\nbe proved that they can be more than offset is no reason for not\r\ntrying to compensate as far as possible at slight further expense.\r\nWhile this may not often permit any great effort to reforest, it\r\nwill usually warrant protection of the natural new growth that\r\nwill follow if given a chance.\r\n\r\n(b) Many owners would prefer to have their milling business continue\r\nindefinitely. If such have or can purchase virgin timber to carry\r\nthem 50 years or more they may do well to grow a log supply to\r\ncome into use at that time, even if they would not do so merely\r\nas a stumpage investment.\r\n\r\n(c) It is highly probable that history will repeat itself in the\r\nUnited States, especially in the Pacific coast states where every\r\nother condition is so favorable to making forestry a great benefit\r\nto the community, and that fire and tax discouragements will be\r\nremoved as soon as the public realizes the situation. The owner\r\nwho anticipates this and gets his crop started first will be the\r\nfirst to profit from it, and since it is the compounding toward the\r\nlatter end of the rotation which now appears serious, the chances\r\nare that he will not have a heavy burden before relief of this\r\nkind arrives.\r\n\r\n(d) Every owner of virgin timber which he expects to hold uncut\r\nfor 10 years or more should consider reforestation of adjacent\r\ncut-over land in the light of fire protection also. It is the\r\ninflammable, sun-dried, brake-covered openings, yearly increasing\r\nin extent, which constitute his greatest fire menace. The conversion\r\nof these into green young growth, too dense for fern and salal and\r\ndestructible only by the hottest crown fires, is the best protection\r\nhe can give mature timber surrounded by them. Some additional expense\r\nfor a few years to accomplish this will usually be cheaper and safer\r\nthan the patrol otherwise required for an indefinite period.\r\n\r\n(e) Advance in value of the land itself, realizable when the second\r\ncrop is cut, will in many cases be great enough to make an otherwise\r\nunpromising reforestation investment profitable.\r\n\r\nHARDWOOD EXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing pages consideration has been given to the growing\r\nof native coniferous species only. There is a field, however, yet\r\nto be entered into by the timber grower in the Pacific Northwest,\r\nwhich gives promise of good returns. This is the growing of eastern\r\nhardwoods. As is well known, the supply of native hardwoods in\r\nthis region is deficient and those occurring are of poor quality.\r\nThe demand for staple hardwoods is constant, and at present can\r\nbe filled only through importation from the East. Moreover, the\r\nmanufacturing industry in the Pacific Northwest is as yet only in\r\nits infancy, and as this industry becomes of greater importance\r\nin the future, the demand for hardwood lumber is bound to increase.\r\nThis increase in demand, coupled with the rapidly diminishing supply\r\nin the East, seems certain to create a condition under which it\r\nwill be profitable to grow hardwoods commercially.\r\n\r\nThat eastern species will thrive under forest conditions in this\r\nregion has not, of course, been demonstrated, but the great variety\r\nof species planted successfully as shade trees in towns and cities, and\r\nin many instances by settlers in the mountains and farming districts,\r\ntogether with the marked success of various fruits introduced here,\r\nwould tend to indicate their adaptability to the climate. In many\r\nrespects the climate along the coast of Oregon and Washington is\r\nsimilar to that found throughout the great hardwood region of the\r\nSouthern Appalachian mountains.\r\n\r\nOf the many species occurring in the East, several appear preëminently\r\nsuited to experimentation because of their particular value in the\r\ntrade and rapid growth. Hickory is one of the most valuable of\r\neastern woods, and the supply remaining is probably least of all\r\nthe important species. It is largely used in the vehicle industry,\r\nand because of the fact that the trade can use trees of small size,\r\nand even prefers \"second growth\" hickory to the more mature form,\r\na crop can be grown within a comparatively short time. Shagbark or\r\npignut are probably the best species to plant. Red oak is another\r\nspecies for which there is a large demand, and while it does not\r\nequal the white oak in value, its more rapid growth makes it a\r\nmore desirable species to grow. The increasing scarcity of white\r\noak has brought about the substitution of red oak for many purposes\r\nfor which the more superior variety was formerly used exclusively.\r\nBlack walnut is a wood highly prized in furniture manufacture, and\r\nthis, coupled with its rapid growth, places it among the first\r\nrank of hardwood trees. Chestnut, white ash, tulip, poplar and\r\nblack cherry are other species whose value for various purposes\r\nsuggests the possible advisability of their introduction.\r\n\r\nMuch that has been said in the chapter concerning the methods of\r\nestablishing coniferous woods applies equally well to hardwoods.\r\nThose species, however, whose seeds are in the form of nuts, such\r\nas hickories, black walnut, chestnuts, and oaks, are particularly\r\nadapted to propagation by direct seeding. Other species, such as\r\nash, tulip, poplar, and black cherry, whose seeds are small, are\r\nbetter grown for one year in nurseries before transplanting into the\r\nfield. Where plantations are started by planting the nuts directly\r\nin the field, the cost will be moderate. The nuts can be obtained\r\nin any quantity from eastern seed dealers, and their cost, together\r\nwith the labor of planting them, should not exceed $4 per acre. Where\r\nthe area planted is level and free from underbrush, preliminary\r\nplowing and harrowing, while adding $1.50 to $2 to the cost per\r\nacre, will add much to the success of the plantation. Cultivation\r\nduring the early years of the life of the trees will also result\r\nin increased growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFORESTRY AND THE FIRE HAZARD\r\n\r\nTHE SLASHING MENACE\r\n\r\nThe function of fire as an aid to reproduction of the forest in some\r\ninstances has been discussed in a preceding chapter. The protection\r\nquestion is of even greater importance, for whether we consider\r\nmature timber or reforestation, no forest management is worth while\r\nif the investment is to burn up. It can be divided broadly under\r\ntwo heads, reduction of risk due to operative methods and general\r\nprotection. Whichever we consider, the interest of every lumberman\r\nis at stake. The fire question affects him in many ways beside the\r\ndanger of direct loss. The sale value of timber in any region is\r\nincreased by knowledge that progressive protective methods prevail\r\namong those operating there. Nothing more effectively removes public\r\ncarelessness with fire, or lack of helpful sympathy with the lumber\r\nindustry in general, than evidence that the lumberman himself is\r\ndevoting every effort to safeguarding instead of wasting this great\r\npublic resource.\r\n\r\nOf operative methods reducing fire risk, one of the most important is\r\ndisposal of logging debris. The deliberate accumulation of immensely\r\ninflammable material, almost always where extremely likely to be\r\nignited, is a form of actually inviting disaster practiced by no\r\nproperty holders except lumbermen. Nowhere is it carried to such\r\nan extreme as in the West, where the refuse left on the ground\r\nis of so great volume as to preclude human control if it is once\r\nfired at a dry time, and where accidental fire is often more of a\r\ncertainty than a liability. Of late, however, the more progressive\r\nlumbermen of the fir region have adopted the practice of firing\r\ntheir slashings annually at a time when the surrounding woods will\r\nnot burn, and the pine men of Idaho and Montana have quite widely\r\nendorsed brush piling. Idaho has a piling law. Oregon already has a\r\nslash burning law which is partially observed. The greatest objection\r\nto such a law is that neither reforestation nor economical protection\r\nindicates the same practice in different types of forest and it is\r\nextremely difficult to make the law both flexible and effective.\r\nMore will be accomplished by voluntary adoption of the method best\r\nsuited to each condition.\r\n\r\nBRUSH PILING\r\n\r\nIn the more open pine stands of the interior, where both logging\r\ndebris and original combustible ground cover are small, slashings\r\nthreaten the adjacent timber less than in denser forests, but are\r\nof peculiar danger to the valuable young growth usually left on\r\nthe area itself. As we have seen in a previous chapter on western\r\nyellow pine, reproduction in dry localities may require scattering\r\nthe brush over the ground and keeping fire out, and there may be\r\nabnormally dense stands suggesting clean slash burning, but as a\r\nrule brush piling is the best course. In view of the importance\r\nof this subject the following extracts are taken from a circular\r\nissued by the Forest Service:\r\n\r\n\"_Advantages of Brush Burning_\r\n\r\n\"The greatest advantage of brush burning is the protection it gives\r\nagainst fire. In many cases brush burning is the only practicable\r\nsafeguard against fire. After the average lumbering operation the\r\nground is covered with slash, scattered about or piled, just as\r\nthe swampers have left it. This, in the dry season, is a veritable\r\nfire trap. Probably 90 per cent of all uncontrolled cuttings are\r\nburnt over, which retards the second crop at least from fifty to\r\none hundred years and perhaps permanently changes the composition\r\nof the forest. Fires may be set by loggers while still at work\r\non the area or several years after by lightning, campers, or\r\nlocomotives. By piling the brush and burning it in wet weather,\r\nor in snow, when there is no danger of the fire spreading, all\r\ninflammable material is removed, and the second growth can come\r\nup without serious risk of being destroyed. Even where only part\r\nof the brush is burned and the rest is piled, as when the piles in\r\nopen places, along ridges, streams, or laid off lines are burned,\r\nvery much is gained in case of fire, since these cleared lanes\r\nform bases from which a fire may be fought.\r\n\r\n\"Besides lessening the danger from fire, brush burning has certain\r\nminor advantages. When the brush on the ground is removed it is\r\nmuch easier for rangers and others to ride or walk through the\r\nforest. This may be very important in case of a fire or in rounding\r\nup cattle. It is also much easier to cut and handle ties, cordwood,\r\nor other timber which may later be taken from the cut-over areas\r\nif the slash is out of the way. By piling and burning the green\r\nbrush as it is cut from the trees by the swampers, as is now being\r\ndone in Minnesota and parts of Montana, the ground is cleared and\r\nskidding is made easier and cheaper. Again, careful piling and\r\nburning of brush improves the appearance of the forest. There is\r\nnothing much more unsightly than a recently cutover area where\r\nno attempt has been made to dispose of tops and lops. Near towns\r\nor resorts and along roads or streams frequented by tourists this\r\npoint should be carefully considered, but as a general rule the\r\nutility of the forest should not be sacrificed for beauty.\r\n\r\n\"_Disadvantages of Burning_\r\n\r\n\"The disadvantages of burning brush are many and, with the one\r\nexception of protection from fire, far outweigh the advantages.\r\nIf protection can be had in some other way, as with more efficient\r\npatrol service or more stringent laws, the practice should in many\r\ncases be abandoned. In many places, especially in the yellow pine\r\ntype, the best, and often the only, reproduction comes up under a\r\nfallen treetop or other brush. Where there is little of the old\r\nstand left, the straggling open top protects the seedlings from the\r\ndirect heat of the sun. Yet brush not only protects the seedlings\r\nfrom the sun but, what is more important, the leaves and broken\r\ntwigs form a cover which retards evaporation of moisture from the\r\nsoil. Over the greater part of the West the soil dries out very\r\nrapidly during the dry season, and this serious retards or even\r\nprevents the growth of seedlings. Even in the moister regions,\r\nsuch as that of the Engelmann spruce type, it is very necessary\r\nto conserve the moisture in the soil after logging to prevent the\r\nremaining trees from being killed through lack of soil moisture.\r\nA third reason why seedlings so often come up only under the down\r\ntreetops is that they are protected from stock. Next to drought,\r\nsheep are perhaps the most serious menace to reproduction, and\r\nthough it would be best to keep all stock off the area for several\r\nyears after logging, in many cases this is not practicable, and\r\non many areas the leaving of the tops on the ground is the only\r\nway to protect reproduction from injury.\r\n\r\n\"In many places after the timber has been cut off gullies and washes\r\nstart in the old wheel ruts, log slides, etc., and these and other\r\nforms of erosion can best be prevented by leaving the brush on the\r\nground, either laid in the incipient washes or scattered over the\r\nsoil that is likely to wash. Brush burning destroys the valuable\r\nsoil cover, and on the spots where the piles are burned the soil\r\nis loosened, which renders it even more liable to erosion.\r\n\r\n\"It is well known that where the forest is burned each year the soil\r\nbecomes poorer and poorer, because nitrogen, the chief fertilizing\r\ningredient of the soil, is given off in the smoke, and only the\r\nmineral elements go back to the soil in the ashes. And, what is\r\nmore injurious, the humus--i. e., the decomposed vegetable matter\r\nin the top soil--is destroyed. In burning brush after logging all\r\nthe fertilizing and humus-forming leaves and twigs are destroyed\r\njust when most needed, for another good crop or leaves cannot be\r\nexpected for many years.\r\n\r\n\"The added cost, both to the lumberman and to the Government, is\r\nanother argument against brush burning. The cost of piling brush\r\nhas varied all the way from 15 cents to $1 or more per thousand,\r\nwith an average or 40 or 50 cents, while the cost or burning may\r\nbe from 5 cents to 25 cents per thousand, averaging about 15 cents.\r\nBy abandoning the practice of brush piling this 60 cents a thousand\r\nwill not be entirely saved, as is claimed by some, for the brush\r\nwill still have to be lopped and disposed of in some other way,\r\nwhich will cost, it is estimated, at least half as much as piling\r\nand burning. But even a saving of 25 or 30 cents a thousand is\r\na strong argument against the practice.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, from a silvicultural viewpoint, the disadvantages of brush\r\nburning far outweigh its advantages. Yet, as a general policy, it\r\nseems unwise, until other methods have proved their efficiency,\r\nto abandon brush piling and burning to any great extent at present.\r\nThe fire danger is a known quality, and, though it is being reduced\r\neach year, it is still a menace. Therefore changes from the present\r\npractice should be made with caution. Brush piling and burning is\r\ncertainly not advisable in all cases, and extensive experiments\r\nshould be made to determine what is the best method of brush disposal\r\nfor the different types and conditions.\r\n\r\n\"_Brush Piling and Burning_\r\n\r\n\"The cost of piling varies with the cost of labor, the methods\r\nof logging, the type, the topography, the kind of trees cut, and\r\nthe time of the year it is done. A few figures will illustrate\r\nthis variation. In the yellow pine type in Montana an addition\r\nto the swampers' wages of 15 cents a thousand would, it is said,\r\nenable them to pile the brush, as they have to handle it anyway.\r\nUsually, however, the piling is done by a separate crew. Much of\r\nthe work is thus duplicated. In yellow pine in the Southwest, brush\r\npiling costs from 45 to 50 cents, while in Montana it can be done\r\nfor 25 cents. One operator in lodgepole in Montana says it is cheaper\r\nfor him to pile than not to, because he can get his skidding done\r\nso much cheaper, yet on other operations it has cost from 50 cents\r\nto $1 a thousand, depending on how thoroughly it is cleaned up.\r\nIn the sugar pine type of California the cost of piling averages\r\nfrom 25 to 35 cents, while the cost in the Douglas fir type, in\r\nMontana and Idaho, averages about 40 cents, and in Engelmann spruce\r\ntype the cost is only about 25 cents a thousand. It is certain,\r\nhowever, that the cost of piling will everywhere be materially\r\nreduced when the operators begin to look on piling as part of the\r\nswampers' regular work and not as an entirely separate job.\r\n\r\n\"Dry brush should never be burned during the dry season, unless\r\nabsolutely necessary for the suppression of an insect invasion.\r\nGreen brush in some places may be burned at any time, but as a\r\nrule it is unsafe to burn it in dry weather. The best time to burn\r\nbrush is in the fall, just after the first snowfall. Then the piles\r\nare dry, and there is no danger that the fire will get beyond control.\r\nBrush may also be burned at the beginning of or during the rainy\r\nseason, when the ground is damp enough to prevent the fire from\r\nspreading, and the brush dry enough to burn readily.\r\n\r\n\"The cost of brush burning varies like the cost of piling. It varies\r\neven more in the same localities, with weather conditions and methods\r\nof piling. Brush that can be burned for 10 or 15 cents a thousand\r\nat a favorable time, as just after the first snow, will cost five\r\nor ten times as much to burn in dry weather, or when the piles are\r\nvery wet. Brush can be burned more easily the first fall after\r\ncutting than it can the second year, when many of the leaves have\r\nfallen off. Brush burning has been done for 13 cents a thousand\r\nin lodgepole, in the Medicine Bow National Forest, while it has\r\ncost 22 cents in similar timber in the Yellowstone, and estimates\r\nof 40 cents a thousand have been made for it in the Rockies. It\r\nis generally admitted that brush can be most economically burned\r\nby the same people who pile it. Recently several contracts have\r\nbeen made in which the purchaser of the timber is required to pile\r\nand burn the brush under the direction of forest officers, as has\r\nbeen the practice in the Minnesota forest for some time. This will\r\nlighten the total cost, and when the weather allows the brush to\r\nbe burned, as logging proceeds, the cost of burning will be offset\r\nby the subsequent reduction in the cost of skidding.\r\n\r\n\"_Piling Without Burning_\r\n\r\n\"Brush piled properly, even though it is not burned, is a great\r\nprotection to the forest. Inflammable material is removed from\r\namong the living trees, and should a fire occur it would be much\r\neasier to fight. This is especially true where reproduction is\r\ndense. Where openings are scarce piles should be made in the most\r\nopen places, and may be larger than those made to be burned.\"\r\n\r\nSLASH BURNING\r\n\r\nIn many regions, especially in western Oregon and Washington, logging\r\ndebris is too great to make piling practicable. But except for\r\nthe damper localities close to the Pacific, the danger from these\r\nimmense accumulations is all the more excessive and, as we have\r\nseen elsewhere, their removal is often desirable in order to further\r\nreforestation by desirable species. Here the only course is to\r\nburn the slashing clean.\r\n\r\nThis is a dangerous process unless every safeguard is employed.\r\nBurning must be at a time in spring or fall when the slashing is\r\ndry enough but the surrounding woods are not. Spring burning is\r\ntheoretically preferable, for it leaves less inflammable material\r\nduring the fire season. The first fire is also easier to control\r\nthen, because repeated experiments may be made, as the slashing\r\ndries, until just the right conditions exist. On the other hand,\r\nit is dangerous if there are many old stumps and logs in which\r\nfire may smoulder to make trouble later. The exponents or fall\r\nburning also argue that with care they can be ready to fire a very\r\ndry slashing safely at the beginning of a rainstorm. Spring burning\r\nseems to have the most advocates, but it is doubtful whether any\r\nrule for all localities and conditions can be given with confidence.\r\nFrequently failure at one season leads to postponement until the\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nIn either case the slashing can be given the advantage of the greatest\r\ndryness with safety if it is surrounded by a cleared fire line from\r\nwhich to work. Firing should be against the wind and if the wind\r\nchanges suddenly the opposite edge should be back fired. Previous\r\ncutting of all dead trees and snags over 25 feet high is urgently\r\nrecommended. The camp crew should be held in readiness, well provided\r\nwith tools, as insurance against accidental escape.\r\n\r\nIts probable restriction of insect breeding is a point of slash\r\nburning likely to receive much future study. It is well known that\r\nmost forest-injuring insects prefer dying trees to vigorous ones;\r\nalso that the existence of an abnormal amount of such material\r\ntends to abnormal breeding and consequent serious attack of vigorous\r\ntimber when the dead material becomes too dry to be inviting. It\r\nis by no means impossible that the supposed immunity of Douglas\r\nfir from insect injury may be largely due to the almost universal\r\ndestruction by fire of logging debris which would otherwise afford\r\nideal breeding places.\r\n\r\nFIRE LINES\r\n\r\nThe division of mature forest into compartments separated by fire\r\nlines is seldom practicable in this country. Nevertheless slashings,\r\ndeadenings and similar fire traps can very often be profitably\r\nconfined by the cleaning of strips which will not only stop or\r\nretard the progress of a moderate fire but also facilitate patrol,\r\nfire fighting or back firing. On favorable ground, where some choice\r\nis offered, much may be done by falling timber inward so as to leave\r\nfew tops near the uncut timber and by the location of skidroads.\r\nSo far as practicable fire lines should be on the tops of ridges,\r\nfor, being slower to go downhill than up, fire is more easily\r\ndiscouraged just as it reaches a crest. Bottoms of gulches are next\r\nin strategic value, and midslopes least.\r\n\r\nSAFEGUARDING EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nThe most fruitful source of fires is spark-emitting locomotives\r\nand logging engines. Much data has been collected showing that with\r\noil at a reasonable price its use is economical from a labor-saving\r\npoint of view as well as from that of safety. It reduces expense\r\nfor watchmen, patrol, fuel cutting, firebox cleaning and firing.\r\nAnd since it is an absolute prevention, while all other measures\r\nmerely seek to minimize the risk, it is probable that even where\r\nthe cost of the oil more than balances these savings it will save\r\nin the long run by averting a costly fire.\r\n\r\nWhere the use of oil cannot be considered, spark arresters are\r\nessential. The argument that they prevent draft is not worth attention.\r\nIt is greatly exaggerated by engineers and firemen prejudiced against\r\ninnovation or too inattentive to keep their fires up properly and\r\nconsequently unnecessarily dependent on occasional forced draft.\r\nThe slight disadvantage involved by the modern improved arrester\r\nis not to be compared with the importance of the safety acquired.\r\n\r\nIn addition to spark arresters, which may fail or be out of order,\r\nlogging engines using fuel other than oil should be provided with\r\na constant tank or barrel supply of six to twelve barrels of water\r\nand 100 feet of hose with proper pumping attachment. With this a\r\nspark fire can be promptly soaked out beyond danger of invisible\r\nsmouldering in rotten wood or duff. When conditions are dangerous,\r\ncareful loggers send a man back to each donkey-setting between\r\nsupper and bedtime to look for possible fires that were not seen\r\nwhen the crew left. Many keep a watchman on the rounds all night.\r\n\r\nRailroad rights of way can usually be kept cleaned and burned at\r\na cost far less than that of otherwise frequent shutdowns of the\r\nentire camp to fight fire or rebuild bridges, to say nothing of\r\nloss of timber.\r\n\r\nPATROL\r\n\r\nThe best way to prevent fire is to prevent it. Putting out fires\r\nalready started is better than letting them burn, but as the real\r\nfoundation of a protective system it is about like lowering a lifeboat\r\nafter the ship has struck. Only by patrol can the incipient spark\r\nor camp fire be extinguished before it becomes a forest fire that\r\nhas to be fought, taking hours or days instead of minutes. One\r\npatrolman can stop 100 incipient fires easier than 100 men can\r\nstop one big fire. Fires in the forest may never be wholly averted,\r\nbut patrol will prevent them from becoming \"forest fires.\"\r\n\r\nThis is why the progressive lumberman no longer waits till forced\r\nto layoff his crew to fight, spending in a day or two a patrolman's\r\nsalary for a season, shutting down his road and mill for lack of\r\nlogs, and perhaps in spite of all losing several thousand dollars'\r\nworth of timber and equipment. It is also why the progressive\r\nnon-operating owner no longer considers fire loss the act of God,\r\nto be reckoned as an investment risk of several per cent. The man\r\nwho does not patrol his timber nowadays is like a millman who hires\r\nno watchman, has no hose or sprinkler equipment, and carries no\r\ninsurance. He _may_ escape loss, but by not making a reasonable\r\neffort to insure against it he takes a course practically unknown\r\nwith other forms of property.\r\n\r\nModern fire patrol is systematic. Trained and organized men have\r\ndefinite duties. Tools, assistance and supplies are available at\r\nknown points and without delay. Trails and look out stations, often\r\nsupplemented by telephone lines, give the greatest efficiency with\r\nthe least number of men. Above all, the system is based on the\r\nfact that results are most truly measured not by the number of\r\nfires extinguished but by the absence of fire at all. Settlers,\r\ncampers and lumbermen are visited, cautioned and converted. In\r\nshort, the patrolman has a certain area in which to improve public\r\nsentiment. His success in this is worth more than efficiency in\r\nfighting fires due to lack of such success. A system devoted to\r\nmere fire fighting to be adequate must grow larger as time goes\r\non. One devoted to preventing fire may be reduced, as time makes\r\nit successful.\r\n\r\nThe cost of efficient patrol varies so directly with the risk that\r\nit is almost constant as an insurance investment. Where prevalence\r\nof fire, difficulty of handling it, etc., make the cost per acre\r\ncomparatively high, there is equivalent certainty of greater loss\r\nif this sum is not spent. Where the owner is warranted in believing\r\nhis risk small it costs but a trifle to provide sufficient patrol\r\nto insure against it. One to 3 cents an acre is spent in the great\r\nmajority of successful patrols in ordinary seasons.\r\n\r\nASSOCIATE EFFORT\r\n\r\nOne of the first lessons learned from the establishment of private\r\npatrol in the West was that both efficiency and economy are obtained\r\nby co-operation between owners. Obviously if one patrolman can\r\ncover the holdings of several, it is foolish for each to hire a\r\nman. If a fire threatens several tracts, it is better to share the\r\nexpense of labor hired to put it out. The same is true of building\r\ntrails, buying tool supplies, etc. This has led to the forming of\r\nassociations which at a minimum cost to each member accomplish\r\nthe many tasks of finding suitable men, having them authorized\r\nby the State, supervising and supplying them, paying emergency\r\nexpense, opening trails, etc. Each member pays his share upon the\r\nacreage he represents.\r\n\r\nThese associations offer other important advantages besides the mere\r\ncheapening of work. They are admirably adapted to modifying the cost\r\nto fit the season. Beginning in spring with an assessment to cover\r\nputting the whole territory under the essentials of supervision and\r\npatrol, they can add men just as required by the progress of dry\r\nweather and reduce again in the fall. Men can be centralized at\r\ndanger points better than through individual effort. Exceedingly\r\nimportant is the means they afford of bringing in the non-resident\r\nowner, the small owner who is not warranted in employing anyone\r\nalone, and the non-progressive owner who would otherwise do nothing\r\nbut is ashamed to stay out of a general movement.\r\n\r\nNo tract can be safely considered as an independent unit. _No protection\r\nconfined to it alone is as good insurance as the removal of risk\r\nfrom the district within which it lies._ Fire is no respecter of\r\nsection lines. There is always danger of unusual weather in which it\r\nmay travel a long distance. It is far better to secure the maximum\r\ngeneral safety in the locality than to have guarded tracts alternating\r\nwith fire traps. Moreover attention to individual tracts does not\r\nimprove surrounding conditions, and the latter may easily become\r\nso bad as to make the cost of individual patrol, as well as the\r\nrisk, far overbalance any financial disadvantage at present through\r\nco-operation.\r\n\r\nAgain, the public is far more likely to take kindly to the enforcement\r\nof fire laws by an association than to the action of an individual\r\nowner against whom some prejudice may exist. Associations greatly\r\nsimplify co-operation with State and Government in fire work and\r\ntend to bring about appropriations for the purpose. They enable\r\nuniform and concentrated effort to improve sentiment and legislation.\r\nThis booklet and the other work done by the Western Forestry &\r\nConservation Association was made possible by the existence of\r\nthe local organizations it represents. Their independent local and\r\nState effect has been marked.\r\n\r\nThe bad fire season of 1910 was a supreme test of the associations\r\nof the Pacific Northwest. They kept the bad fires in their immense\r\nterritory down to a number which can be counted on the fingers\r\nand their losses were comparatively insignificant. Yet under the\r\nweather conditions which existed the thousands of fires they\r\nextinguished would certainly otherwise have swept the country and\r\ncaused a disaster probably unparalleled in American history.\r\n\r\nREFORESTATION AS A FIRE PREVENTATIVE\r\n\r\nHowever progressive the preventive policies adopted, the race between\r\nthem and the increasing sources of hazard resembles that between\r\narmor plate and ordnance in the construction of battleships. While\r\nfor a given population engaged in pursuits endangering the forests\r\nthe risk lessens, the total activity increases at a rate which\r\nmakes the smaller proportionate risk as great in actual measure.\r\nThis is particularly true of the growth of slashing areas. The\r\nvirgin forest becomes more and more and checkered by burned and\r\ncut-over deadenings, veritable fire-traps open to sun and wind,\r\nand, especially west of the Cascades, usually covered by inflammable\r\ndebris, brush or dead ferns. Each year brings nearer the time when,\r\nunless something is done, such will constitute the majority of\r\nonce forested land and the uncut timber will remain like islands\r\nin expanses of extreme danger.\r\n\r\nNext to cultivation, which but a small percentage will receive,\r\nthe safest insurance against recurring fires in these cut-over\r\nareas is a thrifty young second growth. It shades the ground, keeps\r\nout annual vegetation that furnishes fuel when dead, and will itself\r\ncarry none but such furious crown-fires as would be practically\r\nunknown were there no openings for them to gain headway in. This\r\nis less true of pine, but the very best protection which can be\r\ngiven a tract of merchantable fir is a strip of 10 to 50-year second\r\ngrowth surrounding it.\r\n\r\nWhether regarded from the owner's standpoint or that of the public,\r\nreforestation should be considered as a protective measure of extreme\r\nimportance. Actual expenditure to obtain it may easily be profitable\r\nfor this reason alone, for once established it will decrease the\r\ncost of patrol thereafter. Were all cut-over land in the Northwest\r\nimmediately restocked, the fire hazard would be enormously reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFORESTRY AND THE FARMER\r\n\r\nCUTTING METHODS\r\n\r\nIf there is anyone for whom the practice of forestry is practical\r\nand profitable, it is the farmer who owns the timber he uses for\r\nfuel or other purposes. His supply of the most suitable material\r\nis almost always limited and in any case his method of using it\r\nis practically certain to influence his permanent labor expenses.\r\nNevertheless, especially in well-timbered regions, cutting is apt\r\nto be with but two considerations--the quickest clearing of land or\r\nthe easiest immediate fulfillment of some need for tree products--and\r\nthe passage of a few years brings realization that this early\r\nthoughtlessness must be paid for at a high price.\r\n\r\nIn the first place almost all timber of a commercial species has\r\nreal and increasing value. If it is young, this value is increasing\r\ndoubly because of growth. Varying greatly, of course, young timber\r\nin the Pacific Northwest very often adds from 500 to 1,000 board\r\nfeet to the acre annually. This annual gain is taking place even\r\nif the timber has not reached merchantable size, being like coin\r\ndeposited in a toy bank which does not open until full. And this\r\nis true whether the ultimate use may be for fuel, poles, or salable\r\nmaterial like tie or saw timber.\r\n\r\nToo much land is cleared of young growth, merely because such clearing\r\nis easy, which is of such low value for tilling or even pasture that\r\nits use for these purposes does not pay as well in the long run\r\nas would its use for growing timber, especially when the investment\r\nof clearing is considered. The resulting expanse of charred stumps\r\nand logs, producing little but ferns, is a small farm asset at\r\nbest. The timber it would grow may eventually be a large asset.\r\nAnd the labor of clearing applied to a smaller tract of good land\r\nis sure to bring greater returns. An illustration is furnished\r\nby two tracts near the end of a recently completed railroad in\r\nwestern Washington. Twenty years ago a settler slashed a large\r\narea of presumably worthless sapling fir adjoining his tillable\r\nbottom land, set fire to it, piled and burned the remaining poles,\r\n\"seeded down\" a pasture, and enclosed it by an expensive cedar\r\nrail fence. The pasture, never useful except in early spring, grew\r\nup to ferns, and was finally abandoned. Even the fence was moved.\r\nThe settler on the next claim left his part of the same sapling\r\ngrowth to grow and this year sold the timber alone for $1,000 to\r\na tie mill which came into the neighborhood with the railroad. The\r\nmoral of this does not apply to cutting alone, but argues equally\r\nfor preventing fire in second growth.\r\n\r\nIt is also poor economy, if mature timber exists, to cut rapidly\r\ngrowing young timber for fuel because it is nearer the house or\r\neasier to cut. The former has become stationary in production,\r\nwhile the latter, if left, is earning money by growing in quantity\r\nand quality. If young timber must be used, and the land is not\r\nworth actually clearing for cultivation or pasture, it is usually\r\nfar better to thin out the poorest trees, thus leaving the remainder\r\nstimulated to a more rapid growth, which will soon replace those\r\nremoved, than to begin on the edge and take everything.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why a certain poor-soiled timbered portion of\r\nthe average claim should not be considered as a permanent wood\r\nlot, to be treated with the same interest and pride in making it\r\nproduce the greatest quantity of forest products for sale or use that\r\nthe owner accords his fields. With this point of view established\r\nand consequent study given the subject, it will also be easier to\r\ndecide how large this portion should be. In many cases the result\r\nwill be abandonment of the idea that all forest growth is an enemy,\r\nto be destroyed on general principles without calculating what\r\nactual profit there is in destruction.\r\n\r\nAnother point often overlooked in the Pacific Northwest, because\r\nof our local tendency to consider the forest only as something to\r\nstruggle against, is the exactly opposite influence of properly\r\nplaced tree growth upon sale values if the prospective buyer is\r\nfrom the East or from our own cities or tree-less regions. Such\r\nare attracted strongly by the grove-like effect of a few trees left\r\naround the house. Their desire for this is as strongly ingrained\r\nas the average local resident's desire for a completely free outlook\r\nto mark his victory over unfriendly nature. The appeal a place\r\nmakes to a buyer as a pleasant home has frequently as important\r\nan influence on his decision as its purely practical merits.\r\n\r\nHis judgment of the latter, however, is also affected by his earlier\r\nenvironment. If he has lived where farming land is open, evidences\r\nof the labor of clearing are discouraging. The untouched forest,\r\nbeing totally beyond his capacity to estimate the labor its removal\r\nentails, repels him less than stumps, logs, desolate burnings and\r\nlike detailed evidences of the work which lies before him. This\r\nis another reason why the clearing of clearly fertile land may\r\nbe better business than the half-clearing of land perhaps best\r\nsuited for forest growth anyway. Again, not fully realizing the\r\nplentifulness of forest products in the new locality, he may actually\r\noverestimate the value of an attractive piece of forest land showing\r\nevidence of the thoughtful care suggested in a preceding paragraph.\r\n\r\nUSE OF FIRE\r\n\r\nAbove all, it pays the settler in wooded regions to be careful\r\nwith fire. Properly directed and confined, fire is necessary in\r\nclearing land. But there is no profit in allowing uncontrolled\r\nfire to spread from the actual clearing to create a snarl of dead,\r\ndecaying and falling trees and underbrush. It is usually harder\r\nto extend the clearing into such ground than into green timber.\r\nThis added work later is many times that necessary to safeguard\r\nthe burning in the first place.\r\n\r\nIn every case that fire ever escaped from clearing operations,\r\nthe cause was either thoughtlessness or unwillingness to perform\r\ncertain work. Because it is easier to burn a slashing than to pile\r\nand burn; or when a ground burn is desirable, because it is easier\r\nto take chances than to clear a fire line around the area and have\r\na force of men present; because burning at a dry, dangerous time\r\nwill be cleaner and thus save work after the fire; inexperience,\r\ncoupled with unwillingness to take advice from the experienced--these\r\nand like reasons are responsible for the destruction of lives and\r\nproperty worth over and over again the sum that was saved by the\r\nattempted economy. And, although this does not save others, the\r\nperson responsible also usually loses instead of gaining.\r\n\r\nWithout deprecating in the least the importance of agricultural\r\ndevelopment or of lightening the useful and not easy task of the\r\nsettler, it is still terribly true that the agricultural industry\r\nand the settler suffer an annual loss through the destruction of\r\nimprovements, crops and stock by fires from careless clearing that\r\nis far greater financially than the saving in clearing cost which\r\nwas the cause. In other words, agricultural development is retarded\r\ninstead of advanced by its present careless use of fire.\r\n\r\nPLANTING FOR FUEL AND TIMBER\r\n\r\nGreat as are the timber resources of the Pacific Northwest, there\r\nare extensive regions in central and eastern Oregon and Washington\r\nwhere timber is a scarcity, and wood for fuel and farm repair purposes\r\nfor settlers and ranchers can be obtained only at heavy cost. In\r\nsuch situations it will be a paying investment for the farmer to\r\nset out a small plantation simply to produce his own wood for fuel,\r\nfence posts and other purposes. It is true that some time must\r\nelapse before plantations begin to be productive, but by choosing\r\nrapid-growing species and planting closely, the thinnings which\r\nwill be necessary in a few years, even though the trees be small,\r\nwill do for the woodpile. Trees which grow rapidly and at the same\r\ntime produce good wood are, of course, preferable. If they also\r\nsprout from the stump, a little care will maintain the supply\r\nindefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe choice of species for a woodlot must be governed to a great\r\nextent by the location. Many portions of the treeless areas in this\r\nregion are situated at a high altitude where the climatic conditions\r\nare severe and frosts are common throughout every month of the\r\nyear. In such locations only the most hardy trees will succeed.\r\nOther areas are deficient in moisture, and where this deficiency is\r\nso great as to prohibit the growing of agricultural crops by dry\r\nfarming it is useless to attempt growing trees without irrigation.\r\n\r\nProbably the tree most commonly planted in treeless regions has\r\nbeen some species of cottonwood. Lombardy poplar and Balm of Gilead\r\nhave been great favorites. Cottonwood grows rapidly and is hardy\r\nagainst frost, but requires a never-failing supply of water within\r\nfive to twenty feet of the surface. Because of its demands for\r\nmoisture it will not grow on uplands, but thrives along water courses\r\nor where there is plentiful supply of moisture below the surface. Its\r\nfuel value is not high, though the quantity of its wood production\r\ncompensates for its poor quality, nor does it make good fence posts.\r\nWhere quick growth is the main consideration, however, it is a good\r\ntree to plant. The varieties known as Norway and Carolina poplar\r\nare the best.\r\n\r\nGreen ash and hackberry are also hardy against both cold and moisture,\r\nbut of slow growth. Their wood is durable in contact with the soil,\r\nmaking them suitable for fence posts. Where it succeeds black locust\r\ncombines many of the desirable qualities to the highest degree. It\r\nis a rapid grower, makes excellent fence posts and has high fuel\r\nvalue. It is not as hardy against frost as cottonwood and ash,\r\nand while it has been planted successfully in sheltered locations\r\non high plateaus, its success where frosts occur during the summer\r\nmonths is problematical. A closely related species, honey locust,\r\nis more frost-hardy but less desirable in other respects, though an\r\nexcellent tree nevertheless. Other fairly hardy and drought-resistant\r\ntrees are osage orange and Russian mulberry. Their value for fuel\r\nand fence posts is high, but they will not succeed in the most\r\nsevere situations. Box elder is hardy and has been widely planted,\r\nbut it is of low fuel value and short lived.\r\n\r\nIn favorable localities at low altitudes, where moisture is abundant\r\neither through natural precipitation or from irrigation, the number\r\nof species which are adapted to woodlot planting is largely increased.\r\nBlack walnut, black cherry and hardy catalpa are probably the most\r\nvaluable of these. The latter, however, is sensitive to early and\r\nlate frosts.\r\n\r\nWINDBREAKS\r\n\r\nThe planting of windbreaks and shelter belts around dwellings and\r\nfields is of prime importance to the settler in an open country.\r\nNothing adds more to the comfort of the dweller than a belt of\r\ntimber about the home to protect it from the wind. Orchards need\r\nwindbreaks to save them from injury in a wind-swept country, and\r\ngardens are more successful when surrounded by trees. One of the\r\nmost important functions of the windbreak, however, is the saving of\r\nsoil moisture within the protected area, for it is a well established\r\nfact that evaporation takes place more rapidly when there is a\r\nmovement of the atmosphere than when it is calm. It is safe to\r\nsay that a windbreak is effective in preventing evaporation for\r\na distance equal to ten to fifteen times its height.\r\n\r\nSome species, because of the form of their crowns and their rapid\r\ngrowth, are more effective for windbreaks than others. Since more\r\nconiferous trees retain their foliage throughout the entire year,\r\nthey afford protection in winter as well as in summer. Such species\r\nas western yellow, Scotch and Austrian pine grow rapidly, are hardy,\r\nand serve the purpose well. In regions of abundant moisture Douglas\r\nfir or Norway and Sitka spruce are unequaled. European larch has also\r\nbeen very successful in many regions, but, unlike most conifers,\r\nit sheds its leaves in winter. Where a windbreak is to consist of\r\na single row only, it should be of a densely growing type that\r\nbranches close to the ground. For low breaks of this character\r\nthe Russian mulberry and Osage orange are excellent.\r\n\r\nTrees for woodlot or windbreak planting can be purchased from commercial\r\nnurserymen or grown by the farmer. Many growers of orchard trees,\r\nparticularly in the states in the middle West, do a large business\r\nin forest tree seedlings. Since the transportation charges are\r\noften high, and since most farmers can give the attention and labor\r\nnecessary to raising the trees themselves without inconvenience\r\nor extra expense, it is often desirable for them to do so. The\r\nForest Service of the U. S. Department of Agriculture has issued\r\nseveral publications containing full directions for the establishment\r\nof nurseries, and these can be obtained from the Superintendent of\r\nPublic Documents, Washington, D. C., free or at a nominal cost.[*]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: Reprint from Yearbook, Dept. of Agr., 1905, \"How to\r\nGrow Young Trees for Forest Planting.\"\r\n\r\nBulletin No. 29, \"The Forest Nursery.\"\r\n\r\nPlanting leaflets for almost all important forest trees.]\r\n\r\nPlanting may be done in the spring or fall, the latter being often\r\npreferable in regions where a dry season occurs early in the summer.\r\nFor plantations of broadleaf species, one-year-old seedlings are\r\nbest suited, while coniferous species should be two to three years\r\nold. The chief points to remember in setting out the trees are\r\nnot to allow the roots, particularly of coniferous trees, to dry\r\nout; to dig the holes large enough to enable the roots to take a\r\nnormal position without doubling up, and to pack the soil firmly\r\naround them. Where planting is done on open ground, it is highly\r\nadvantageous to plow and harrow the soil before setting out the\r\ntrees in order to preserve the moisture and kill weeds and sod.\r\n\r\nWillows, cottonwoods and other poplars are very easily propagated\r\nfrom cuttings. Cuttings should be of strong, healthy wood of the\r\nprevious season's growth which ripened well and did not shrivel\r\nduring the winter. A good length is 8 to 12 inches, with the upper\r\ncut just above a bud. They may be made when wanted and planted\r\nwith a spade, or if the ground is mellow they can be merely shoved\r\ninto the soil until only one bud is above the surface and then\r\ntramped.\r\n\r\nThe spacing of the trees is a question largely of utility, with\r\nsome variation for different species. In general, however, close\r\nplanting is advisable in treeless regions, since an artificial\r\nforest must stand in a dense mass if it is to succeed in the struggle\r\nagainst native vegetation, wind, sunshine, frost and dry weather. A\r\nsingle tree or row unprotected by associates has a poorer chance.\r\nCultivation is the best method of conserving soil moisture. To obtain\r\nthe best results plantations should be cultivated, if possible,\r\nat least during the first few years. The less care the trees are\r\nto have, the thicker they should be set in order that they will\r\nbe close enough to establish forest conditions of shade, litter\r\nand underbrush. Thinnings can then be made as they grow and need\r\nmore room. The material thus obtained will provide an early supply\r\nof fuel, stakes and posts. A spacing of 4x4 feet is common, but\r\nthis does not allow for cultivation. For this reason 2x8 feet is\r\npreferable. Shelter belts should be planted closely in order to\r\ngive protection quickly.\r\n\r\nCOST\r\n\r\nThe cost of planting is not great. Broadleaf seedlings will cost\r\nfrom $1 to $6 per thousand at the nursery, coniferous plants $2.50\r\nto $10. If grown at home the cost will be greatly reduced. The\r\npreparation of the soil by plowing and harrowing should not exceed\r\n$2 per acre, and planting from $2.50 to $5 per thousand, according\r\nto the species, the method used and the condition of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nTAX REFORM TO PERMIT REFORESTATION\r\n\r\nLOSS IN IDLE LAND\r\n\r\nIt is of the very highest importance to have that part of our constantly\r\nincreasing area of cut and burned over forest land which is not\r\nmore valuable for agriculture put to its only useful purpose--the\r\ngrowing of another forest crop. If this is done it will continue to\r\nbe a source of tax revenue, to employ labor and support industry,\r\nto supply our forest needs, to bring revenue into the state, and to\r\nprotect our streams. Otherwise it will become a desert, non-taxable,\r\nnon-productive, a fire menace, and in every way worse than a dead\r\nloss to the state in which it exists and to the country at large.\r\nIn the one way it will be of use to every citizen, whatever his\r\noccupation; in the other it will be a burden upon every citizen.\r\n\r\nThe realness and directness of this problem in the Pacific Northwest\r\nis seldom realized. Our deforested areas are great and growing, but\r\nof even more peculiar significance is our unparalleled opportunity\r\nfor making them quickly profitable to the community. Forest growth\r\nis more rapid and certain than elsewhere. A heavy crop may be had\r\nagain in from 40 to 60 years. It will hardly be of the quality of\r\nthat now being cut, but considering the shortage then to prevail\r\nshould bring fully as much wealth into the state from its manufacture,\r\nthe majority to be circulated as payment for supplies and labor.\r\nSince, therefore, our denuded land should in 60 years or less bring\r\nin again as much as it has already, its idleness costs us each year\r\na sixtieth or more of that immense sum, amounting to a great many\r\nmillions of dollars annually. To this loss is added the loss of\r\ntax revenue which the new crop would yield, with countless indirect\r\ninjuries.\r\n\r\nTHE OWNER'S COMPULSORY ATTITUDE\r\n\r\nFor this situation our system of taxation is chiefly responsible.\r\nThe owner may or may not hold the land for a time under the present\r\nsystem, in the hope of selling it or of tax reform, but he will\r\nseldom if ever take any steps to insure reforesting, because to\r\ndo so is too likely to be at an actual loss. Whether he has made\r\nmoney on the original crop has no bearing; nor has his being rich\r\nor poor, resident or alien. His cut-over land presents a distinct\r\nproblem to him.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, its sale value represents an investment. He\r\nmay sell and reinvest the money in any business which looks\r\ninviting--perhaps in standing timber. Presumably he can get ordinary\r\nbusiness returns, 6 per cent or more, and continue to reinvest\r\nthese returns. Therefore if he leaves this money in forest land\r\nfor 50 years without return, for every dollar so tied up he must\r\nget $18.42 at the end of that period if he is to make 6 per cent on\r\nthe investment. And this applies not only to the present value of\r\nthe land, but also to any added expense he incurs in modifying his\r\ncutting methods, or in replanting, in order to insure reforestation.\r\nIf both together amount to $5 an acre, he must net $92.10 at the\r\nend of his 50 years in order to make 6 per cent.\r\n\r\nSo far no complaint can be made. But if the land is to produce a\r\nsecond crop it cannot be left to take care of itself, as it might\r\nwere it being held for speculative purposes only. It must be protected\r\nfrom fire and trespass. And since the interest and principal invested\r\nwill amount to so much for so long a period and be totally lost in\r\ncase of destruction, the protection must be adequate, practically\r\namounting to insurance. The annual cost will vary greatly according\r\nto locality, class of timber, and the enforcement of fire laws,\r\nbut will be from 1 cent at the minimum to 15 cents at the maximum\r\nin bad seasons. If all cost of protection and administration is\r\nplaced at only 5 cents annually, for the sake of illustration,\r\nthis represents another investment constantly increasing and\r\ncompounding, which, at the end of 50 years at 6 per cent, will\r\namount to $14.51 an acre. Consequently, adding that to his original\r\ninvestment which will have become $92.10, he must net $106.61 to\r\nmake his 6 per cent.\r\n\r\nHOW TAXES ENTER THE PROBLEM\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the influence of taxation. We have assumed the\r\nland to be valuable for forest growing only, and in calling his\r\ninvestment $5 an acre included some cost of insuring reforestation.\r\nPlace this at $2 and leave a land value of $3, to be fully taxed\r\nat 30 mills for both state and county purposes, which is perhaps\r\na fair average. This represents the third form of his investment,\r\nor 9 cents an acre invested annually and left unavailable for 50\r\nyears, and will amount at the end of that time, at 6 per cent, to\r\n$26.13. He has now to clear $132.74 an acre, besides being always\r\nin danger of total or partial loss from fire, _and during all this\r\ntime has to have the money, made in some other way, to meet all the\r\nannual payments._ But no injustice appears, for he has been taxed\r\non an equal basis with other producers. If his acre yields 20,000\r\nfeet (the maximum to expect), worth $7 a thousand, he has made his\r\n6 per cent, the community has gained a resource, and everyone is\r\nsatisfied. His land has been taxed fairly and as he now has a crop\r\nto sell he can afford to pay a tax on it also. If it is taxed at 3\r\nper cent, or $4.20 an acre, county and state will altogether have\r\nreceived from him the same tax revenue they collect from other forms\r\nof property and industry of like value and profit, and received\r\nalso the other benefits of forest production and of his expenditure\r\nof wages for protection.\r\n\r\nBut this is just what cannot legally be done under our present\r\ntax system. _By failure to recognize that the growth produced is\r\na crop, distinct from the land, grown at the owner's effort and\r\nexpense, and returning no revenue until ripe, the law now compels\r\nthe repeated annual taxation of the owner's effort to an extent very\r\nlikely to amount to confiscation._ It has been seen that even under\r\nthe fair system outlined in the preceding paragraph, forest growing\r\nis not more than ordinarily inviting and involves considerable risk\r\nand capital. Yet it assumed only a fair annual tax on the land.\r\nUnder our present system, logically carried out, here is what would\r\nhappen:\r\n\r\nThe first year the tax would be the same. The second year a fiftieth\r\nof the total fifty-year crop, which we have assumed worth about\r\n$140, or $2.80, would be added to the land; therefore not $3, but\r\n$5.80, will bear the 30-mill levy, and not 9 cents, but 17 cents,\r\nactual tax will be paid. The third year the tax will be 25 cents\r\nan acre; at the twenty-fifth year it will be over $2 an acre. We\r\nhave seen that even a 9-cent tax amounted to an investment of over\r\n$26 an acre in order to produce the crop. The continual increase\r\nof this according to growth would make the investment run into\r\nmany hundreds of dollars if the same interest is calculated, and\r\nin any case would make reforestation _financially impossible_.\r\n\r\nIn actual practice, the increased valuation would probably not\r\nbe made by the assessor in the manner just described. Instead of\r\ndetermining the rate of growth scientifically and applying it annually,\r\nhe now makes an ocular reappraisement at considerable intervals.\r\nIn most cases there is no increased value, for the land does not\r\nreforest but is continually reburned. Where it accidentally does\r\nreforest, he makes a rough calculation of the value of the second\r\ngrowth, based upon no particular system and seldom alike in different\r\ncounties. But the principle remains the same and the result differs\r\nonly in degree. With the most lenient valuation at 10 or 15-year\r\nintervals, the addition of material which makes growing forests\r\nso different from our stationary mature forests of today is bound,\r\nunder our present system, to have confiscatory effect. The land\r\nowner, so far from being encouraged to establish and protect a\r\nnew forest, is actually penalized, for he must assume that its\r\nexpectation value will be taxed annually, perhaps on an exorbitant\r\nbasis, as soon as it becomes apparent.\r\n\r\nIf only the value _added each year_, $2.80 in our illustration,\r\nwere taxed annually, there would be no injustice. The tax would\r\nthen, in the case cited, be 9 cents the first year and 17 cents\r\nevery year thereafter. But this cannot be calculated with sufficient\r\naccuracy upon our present knowledge of forest growth and under\r\nconditions varying with every trace or acre. Our example, with its\r\nseveral arbitrary factors of growth, tax rate, interest rate, and\r\nfuture stumpage price, was merely for the purpose of illustration.\r\nFurthermore, such a solution would still be illegal under our present\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS REFORM MUST MEET\r\n\r\nThese facts are recognized by all students of forestry and taxation.\r\nIn all countries where forests are grown the general property tax\r\nhas been abandoned. Disinterested authorities of every class,\r\napproaching the subject only from the public's point of view and\r\nholding no brief for the timberland owner, unite in saying emphatically\r\nthat its application to growing forests will retard or prevent\r\nforestry in our country. These authorities include statesmen like\r\nRoosevelt and our most prominent governors and senators; expert\r\nauthorities on taxation generally, like state, national, and\r\ninternational tax conferences and professors of economics in the\r\nleading universities; forestry authorities like Graves, Pinchot\r\nand State foresters; and all the many associations and congresses\r\ndevoted to such subjects.\r\n\r\nThese authorities all agree that the forest crop should not be\r\ntaxed till harvested, but differ somewhat as to the degree to which\r\nthe public need of reforestation warrants deferring part or all of\r\nthe land tax also. This Association, after careful study of the\r\nsubject, including European methods, the experiments made by several\r\nof our States, and the plans proposed by many others, believes the\r\nfollowing objects should be sought:\r\n\r\n1. Greater permanent revenue to state and country than is possible\r\nunder the present system of destroying the taxable source.\r\n\r\n2. Sustention of present revenue to the highest degree compatible\r\nwith permanence.\r\n\r\n3. Assurance that the owner will do his fair part to make the land\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\n4. Assurance to the owner in return that future action by the community\r\nwill not confiscate all profit resulting from his effort.\r\n\r\n5. Division of risk, so both owner and community will seek highest\r\nproduction and safety from fire.\r\n\r\n6. Demonstrable justice to all concerned, rather than subsidy which,\r\nwhile doubtless warrantable to secure the public good, affords\r\nless precise basis of legislation at the present time.\r\n\r\n7. Simplicity in adoption and operation.\r\n\r\nA SUGGESTED SOLUTION\r\n\r\nThese requirements can be met by legislation, following constitutional\r\namendment where necessary, providing that where the owner of cut or\r\nburned-over land will contract with the State to insure reforestation\r\nand protection for a specified term of years, the State shall notify\r\nthe county assessor that the land is separated for taxation purposes\r\nfrom any forest growth thereon. The land may continue to pay a fair\r\ndependable tax, but the crop shall not be taxed until harvested.\r\nTo the end that cutting of standing timber shall be conducted so\r\nas to place the land in the best condition for reforesting, uncut\r\nforest land should be subject to examination and similar contract,\r\nand the separate classification for taxation should take effect\r\nwithin a year after the timber is removed in compliance with the\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nThis would mean that when the owner of deforested land chiefly\r\nvaluable to the community for forest production agrees to make it\r\nproduce, he shall be taxed not on his effort but upon the results\r\nof his effort, and then exactly as other producers are taxed upon\r\ntheir results. He may pay tax upon his land, as other land owners\r\ndo, upon its actual value, but without this value being enhanced\r\nfor taxation purposes by reason of any crop thereon.\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON WITH PRESENT SYSTEM IN RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe community would get no less tax revenue, but presumably more,\r\nthan it does under the present system. In either case the owner\r\nwill really pay annually only upon the land value, not upon the\r\ngrowth; the only difference being that under the proposed system\r\nhe would not be asked to, while under the present system _either\r\nthere will be no growth to tax, or, if there is, he cannot afford\r\nto pay and the land will revert_. It must be borne in mind that\r\nwhile cut-over land is actually being held under the present system,\r\nit has seldom grown anything yet. No expense has been incurred to\r\nestablish a crop, accidental growth is almost always destroyed\r\nby fire because it does not pay to protect it, and if it is not so\r\ndestroyed it has not yet been accorded the expectation value which\r\nthe assessor will be obliged to recognize in the early future if he\r\nreally observes the present law. The inevitable tendency of the\r\npresent system is continuance to pay on the land with speculative\r\nvalue for purposes other than forestry but _abandonment of land\r\nvaluable only for forestry, with destruction of the forest growth\r\nin either case_, by purpose or negligence, because it means added\r\ncost of holding with no possibility of profit. Since the owner\r\ncannot be compelled to grow timber to be taxed at his net loss,\r\nno timber tax at all will be received by the community and its\r\nannual land tax will be confined to land worth holding without\r\ntimber for purposes other than timber growing. Under the proposed\r\nsystem, the latter class would pay the same annual tax, the annual\r\ntax revenue from strictly forest land would be greater, and in\r\naddition to both would be the future yield tax upon the crop.\r\n\r\nAN OBJECTION MET\r\n\r\nA possible superficial criticism may be that, leaving the land out\r\nof consideration, the proposed yield tax at a personal property\r\nvaluation of the crop means that but one year's tax is to be paid\r\nupon the timber. The fallacy of this, however, will be seen when it\r\nis remembered that it is a crop, having been produced from nothing\r\nby the owner, since his acquisition of the land and while he was\r\npaying taxes upon his land upon its value for productive purposes\r\nthroughout the entire period just as any other crop grower loes.\r\n_It is not unearned speculative increment._ To tax it annually is\r\nexactly equivalent to taxing an agricultural crop 50 times during\r\nits growing period. The proposed plan does tax the annual production\r\nfully, although not until the crop is produced, for taxing its full\r\nvalue when grown is the same as taxing each year the increment\r\nadded since the preceding year. If it is worth $150 an acre, after\r\n50 years from seed, a 3 per cent yield tax would be $4.50. Each\r\nyear since the first must have produced a fiftieth of the ultimate\r\nvalue, or $3, and had this been taxed at 3 per cent, or 9 cents,\r\nthe same aggregate revenue of $4.50 would have resulted. To also\r\ntax annually the value of proceeding years' production, like taxing\r\na wheat crop twice a week, is exactly the confiscatory prohibition\r\nof forest growing which we should seek to avoid.\r\n\r\nWhen the essential difference of the two systems Is grasped--that\r\nthe _crop is distinct from the land and the latter is still fully\r\ntaxed_--it will be seen that but one tax upon the crop, at the\r\nrate other property pays, is all that is just and all that can\r\npossibly be paid in a competitive commercial business. The case is\r\nnot analogous with our present system of taxing mature timber, in\r\nwhich land and timber together are assumed to constitute inseparable\r\nrealty, _stationary in production_ and increasing only speculatively\r\nin value, therefore the comparison with one year's taxation under\r\nour present system has no weight.\r\n\r\nFROM THE OWNER'S STANDPOINT\r\n\r\nNor does the proposed system by any means either subsidize the forest\r\ngrower or assure him a profit. It merely puts on a basis similar to\r\nthat of other enterprises a business more greatly handicapped by\r\nlong-deferred returns, risk of loss, uncertainty of future prices,\r\nand continued current expense without current revenue. Only escape\r\nfrom fire and high future stumpage prices will permit profit at\r\nbest. Otherwise, since the tax is definite and not upon income,\r\nthe forest grower will pay the community for the honor of providing\r\nit a resource at his own expense.\r\n\r\nIt is believed, however, that a more fortunate outcome is sufficiently\r\npromised in this region of rapid growth if we remove the single\r\nfatal handicap of uncertain confiscatory taxation.\r\n\r\nVIEWS OF EXPERT AUTHORITIES\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT: Second only in importance to good fire laws\r\nwell enforced is the enactment of tax laws which will permit the\r\nperpetuation of existing forests by use.\r\n\r\nGIFFORD PINCHOT: Land bearing forests should be taxed annually\r\non the land value alone, and the timber crop should be taxed when\r\ncut, so private forestry may be encouraged.\r\n\r\nNORTH AMERICAN CONSERVATION CONFERENCE, Washington, D. C.: Believing\r\nthat excessive taxation on standing timber privately owned is a potent\r\ncause of forest destruction by increasing the cost of maintaining\r\ngrowing forests, we agree in the wisdom and justice of separating\r\nthe taxation of timber land from the taxation of timber growing\r\nupon it, and adjusting both in such manner as to encourage forest\r\nconservation and forest growing.\r\n\r\nThe private owners of land unsuited to agriculture, once forested\r\nand now impoverished or denuded, should be encouraged by practical\r\ninstruction, adjustment of taxation, and in other proper ways,\r\nto undertake the reforesting thereof.\r\n\r\n    GIFFORD PINCHOT,\r\n    ROBERT BACON,\r\n    JAMES R.

DE QUEVEDO,\r\n    CARLOS SELLERIER,\r\n  Commissioners representing the Republic of Mexico.\r\n    E. H. OUTERBRIDGE,\r\n  Commissioner representing the Colony of Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nFRED. R. FAIRCHILD, Professor of Economics, Yale University, member\r\nInternational Tax Conference: Probably nothing more effectually\r\ndiscourages investment than uncertainty as to future costs. And\r\nwhatever may be said of the present system of taxation, there can\r\nbe no question of its arbitrariness and uncertainty. If to all the\r\nother risks of forestry we add uncertainty as to what the taxes\r\nare going to be, we cannot blame investors for some hesitation in\r\nembarking on an enterprise which may have to pay taxes fifty years\r\nbefore the returns come in. And more than this; the investor cannot\r\nsafely base his calculations on the continuance of the present\r\nlenient administration of the property tax. As has been shown, the\r\ntendency today is toward a stricter enforcement of the law and a\r\nheavier burden of taxation.\r\n\r\nState constitutions stand today in the way of many plans for reform\r\nin State and local taxation. The movement toward their amendment\r\nis growing as part of the general programme of tax reform.\r\n\r\nThe real problem of forest taxation is in connection with the future\r\nof our timber lands rather than with their past. The preservation\r\nof the forests is a matter of the utmost importance. So far our\r\nforests have been exploited with little or no regard for the future.\r\nBut the present methods cannot last much longer. Forestry must come\r\nsome time, and its early coming is a thing greatly to be desired.\r\nAnd whenever we are ready to seriously undertake it we will find our\r\npresent methods of taxation a severe handicap. Strictly enforced,\r\naccording to the letter of the law, the annual tax on the full\r\nvalue of the land and standing timber is almost sure to result\r\nin excessive taxation, and the timber owner cannot count on the\r\ncontinuance of the present lenient enforcement of the law. Even if\r\nthe tax might not be excessive, its uncertainty would be a serious\r\nobstacle to investment. We can hardly hope to see the general practice\r\nof forestry as long as the present methods of taxation continue.\r\n\r\nTo be equitable, taxation of timber lands like taxation of anything\r\nelse should be based on income or earning power.\r\n\r\nWith regard to its effect on revenue, there is little to be feared\r\nfrom the tax on yield. Eventually, revenue will be increased by\r\na method of taxation which does not prevent the development of\r\nforestry. Forests paying a moderate tax are better than waste lands\r\nabandoned and paying no tax at all.\r\n\r\nThe tax on yield has many decided advantages. It avoids the evils\r\nof the general property tax. It is equitable and certain. It is in\r\nharmony with the peculiarities of the business of forestry, and\r\nwill be a distinct encouragement to the practice of forestry. Its\r\nadoption by the States would remove one obstacle to the perpetuation\r\nof the nation's forest resources.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL CONSERVATION COMMISSION, appointed by the President of\r\nthe United States: It is far better that forest land should pay\r\na moderate tax permanently than that it should pay an excessive\r\nrevenue temporarily and then cease to pay at all.\r\n\r\nWe tax our forests under the general property tax, a method of\r\ntaxation abandoned long ago by every other great nation. In some\r\nregions of great importance for timber supply, and in individual cases\r\nin all regions, the taxation of forest lands has been excessive and\r\nhas led to waste by forcing the destructive logging of mature forests,\r\nas well as through the abandonment of cut-over lands for taxes. That\r\nthis has not been even more general is due to under-assessment, to\r\nlax administration of the law, but to no virtue in the law itself.\r\nAlready taxes upon forest lands are being increased by the strict\r\nenforcement of the tax laws. Even where this has not yet been done,\r\nthe fear that it will be done is a bar to the practice of forestry.\r\n\r\nWe should so adjust taxation that cut-over lands can be held for\r\na second crop. We should recognize that it costs to grow timber\r\nas well as to log and saw it.\r\n\r\nFrom now on the relation of taxation to the permanent usefulness\r\nof the forest will be vital. Present tax laws prevent reforestation\r\non cut-over lands and the perpetuation of existing forests by use.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES FOREST SERVICE: It is evident that the old method of\r\ntaxing forest property, as well as other property, at its supposedly\r\nfull value will, as the value of timber increases and is recognized,\r\nput a premium on premature and reckless cutting, and will hinder any\r\neffort to reforest cut-over lands. No business man will engage in\r\nan undertaking where the returns are so long deferred and the risks\r\nare uninsurable unless he can estimate the probable expenses and a\r\nreasonably large profit. That the forests themselves, irrespective\r\nof their ability to stand taxation, are of great value to the\r\ncommunities in which they are located, for water protection, lumber\r\nsupply, and scenery in resort regions is undoubted.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental difficulty is that the tax should be in proportion\r\nto yield or income and not in proportion to the market value of\r\nthe land and standing timber. Economists are substantially agreed\r\nthat this principle is applicable to the taxation of all kinds\r\nof property with certain exceptions. Where there is a reasonably\r\ncertain annual yield or income the market value is theoretically\r\ndependent upon it. A woodlot or forest, however, usually in this\r\ncountry has no annual yield. It is unjust to require the owner\r\nto carry the full annual burden of taxes, risk and protection in\r\nevery year for the chance of a yield once in fifty years, and it\r\nis impossible for the owner to do it, for the taxes with compound\r\ninterest would confiscate his entire capital.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL TAX CONFERENCE, held at Toronto: _Resolved_, That\r\nit is within the legitimate province of tax laws to encourage the\r\ngrowth of forests in order to protect watersheds and insure a future\r\nsupply of timber; and legislation, or constitution amendment where\r\nnecessary, is recommended for these purposes.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN FOREST CONGRESS, Washington, D. C.: _Resolved_, That we\r\nearnestly commend to all state authorities... reducing the burden\r\nof taxation on lands held for forest reproduction in order that\r\npersons and corporations may be induced to put in practice the\r\nprinciples of forest conservation.\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY: Tax assessors have differing\r\nideas of value and their assessments vary widely. The only remedy\r\nfor the forest owner is to appeal from the assessment to the county\r\ncommissioners, and, if here unsuccessful, to the county court, a\r\nmatter involving both time and expense and frequently more costly\r\nthan the differences in taxes to be gained; _but at the same time_\r\nthe fact is well recognized that forested land is both unequally\r\nand unfairly taxed.\r\n\r\nH. S. GRAVES, Chief Forester for the United States: The forest areas\r\nnow owned chiefly by lumber companies will cease to be devastated\r\nas soon as fires are stopped. They will not, however, be handled\r\nto any large extent with a view of future production until the\r\ntaxes are placed on a fair basis.\r\n\r\nFILIBERT ROTH, Professor of Forestry, University of Michigan, State\r\nFire Warden of Michigan (speaking of frequent local attitude toward\r\nnon-resident owner):\r\n\r\nThough, in truth, these resident people often make their living\r\nfrom the tax money of the non-resident, and though the latter\r\ncontributes toward every rod of road and every schoolhouse built,\r\nand other improvement, yet he is treated as if he were a wrongdoer,\r\nis taxed unmercifully, and, in addition, a trespass on his land\r\nor forest is excused and it is almost impossible in many places\r\nto get conviction.\r\n\r\nIf the State and local people had treated the owners of timber\r\nhonestly and had spent a reasonable part of the taxes in giving\r\nthe protection which the owner had a right to expect under the\r\nConstitution, there would still be more than half of our pinery\r\nlands covered by forest.\r\n\r\nForestry is no \"sugar trust baby,\" as so many are trying to make it\r\nout. Forests can pay taxes as well as any other property. Forestry\r\nis like any other honest business, it cannot stand confiscation.\r\n\r\nSuppose you have a twenty-acre lot of sugar beets and the assessor\r\nwould hang around until the beets are ripe and then figure: \"The\r\nland is good; I assess it at $75 per acre, and the crop is worth\r\n$75 more, so that this property will stand at $150.\" What would\r\nyou say? But the assessor who assesses the timber as part of the\r\nreal estate and assesses the same crop of timber year after year\r\ndoes precisely this thing. He assesses land and crop for the owner\r\nof a woodlot and forest, while for all other farmers he assesses\r\nonly the land.\r\n\r\nLet the State pass a few simple laws; provide for the protection\r\nof forest property as we provide for other property; prevent\r\nconfiscation under the guise of taxation; stop forcing its poor\r\ntax lands on the market, and go ahead with a good example on its\r\nown lands, and instead of holding them in a waste land condition\r\nprotect them and grow timber.\r\n\r\nA. T. HADLEY, President Yale University: We have it in our power\r\nto make intelligent forestry by individuals more profitable. The\r\nmargin between business that succeeds and business that fails is\r\na narrow one, and by just covering that margin by _differences\r\nin tax laws_, by differences in protective laws, by laws for the\r\nprevention of fires, we can make profitable an industry which the\r\npublic needs, but which today is unprofitable.\r\n\r\nJAMES O. DAVIDSON, Governor of Wisconsin: It is to be hoped that\r\nlaws will be passed encouraging owners to cut timber conservatively\r\nunder forestry regulations, rather than oblige them to cut as quickly\r\nas possible to escape the injustice of taxation.\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR F. G. MILLER, University of Washington: Next to fire the\r\nmost serious handicap to the progress of forestry is our unjust\r\nmethod of forest taxation. Laying as we do a yearly tax on both\r\nthe growing crop and the land, the burden of taxation makes the\r\nholding of land for a second crop prohibitive as far as the private\r\nowner is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe farmer pays a yearly tax on his land, and a tax on his crop\r\neach time he harvests one. This is usually annually. However, if\r\nthrough drought, insect invasion or other misfortune he loses his\r\ncrop, he is not called upon to pay a tax upon it.\r\n\r\nSENATOR REED SMOOT, of Utah, Chairman Section of Forests, National\r\nConservation Commission: One of the urgent tasks before the States\r\nis the immediate passage of tax laws which will enable the private\r\nowner to protect and keep productive under forest those lands suitable\r\nonly for forest growth. In our discussion in committee meeting\r\nthere was a question raised by a member present as to this\r\nrecommendation, claiming that it would encourage great monopolies\r\nin securing larger holdings of timber, if an annual tax was not\r\nrequired on the timber itself. I have studied this question in\r\nforeign lands, particularly in Germany and Switzerland, and I find\r\nthat the result has been exactly the opposite. It is a short-sighted\r\npolicy which invites, through excessive taxation, the destruction of\r\nthe only crop which steep mountain lands will produce profitably.\r\nTaxes on forest land should be levied on the crop when cut, not\r\non the basis of a general property tax--that unsound method of\r\ntaxation long abandoned by every other great nation.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR NEWTON C. BLANCHARD, of Louisiana: Under the present tax\r\nlaws of many of the States large assessments are put on timber\r\nlands, and this is forcing timber holders--the owners of the\r\nsawmills--to cut off that timber too rapidly. At least it is having\r\nmuch effect that way. Give them the encouragement to hold back\r\nand not force their product upon the markets, and then exempt,\r\nby a system of wise tax laws, cut-over lands devoted to purposes\r\nof reforestation.\r\n\r\nMARYLAND STATE BOARD OF FORESTRY: The present method is to assess\r\nwoodlands under the general property tax, making the assessment\r\nhigh where the timber is valuable and placing it low where the\r\ntimber has been cut off. There is in the operation of this system\r\na tendency to cut off the timber before it reaches maturity to\r\navoid the high rate of taxation. A premium is placed on forest\r\ndestruction and a penalty on forest conservation.\r\n\r\nThe growth of timber is slow and under present stumpage prices\r\nand rates of taxation there are comparatively few cases where the\r\nsale value of the crop equals the cost of growing it, if a fair\r\nrental for the land is considered. It is true that most of the\r\nforests are on lands that could not be used for anything else,\r\nbut it is not fair to expect the landowner to produce timber which\r\nis a public necessity, the use of which is only less universal than\r\nfood crops, at a financial sacrifice. Increasing prices and better\r\nforest management are relieving the situation to some extent, but\r\nthe most effective, as well as the most equitable way, is through\r\na change or modification of present tax laws.\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR EDWIN R. A. SELIGMAN, Columbia University: The general\r\nproperty tax as actually administered is beyond all doubt one of\r\nthe worst taxes known in the civilized world. Because of its attempt\r\nto tax intangible as well as tangible things, it sins against the\r\ncardinal rules of uniformity, of equality, and of universality\r\nof taxation.\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR ALFRED AKERMAN, Georgia University: One reason why it\r\n(the general property tax) is so outrageous in practice is that\r\nit is wrong in theory. The mere possession of property may or may\r\nnot be an index to the ability of the owner to pay tax. It all\r\ndepends on whether the property brings income.\r\n\r\nALLEN HOLLIS, Secretary Society for Protection of New Hampshire\r\nForests: Taxation today, in my opinion, is the greatest menace\r\nto forest preservation.\r\n\r\nOne principle is absolutely sound--we all know it, and what we\r\nhave to do is to make everybody else know it--and that is, that\r\nthe annual taxation on a crop which is constantly increasing in\r\nvalue each year means confiscation of that property.\r\n\r\nIt is submitted here that no single factor bears so definitely\r\nupon the future of our forests as this constitutional requirement\r\nof equality in taxation. As a business proposition, no one can\r\nafford to hold woodlands and pay annually 2 per cent upon their\r\nactual value, increased each year by growth and advancing prices,\r\nduring the fifty to one hundred years necessary for maturing the\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nCHARLES LATHROP PACK, Director American Forestry Association: While\r\nthe nation and the State are working to devise ways and means of\r\nconserving our forest resources, we are at the same time, in a\r\nreal sense, taxing our timber to death.\r\n\r\nOur present tax laws prevent reforestation on cut-over lands and\r\nthe perpetuation of existing forests by proper use and economic\r\ncutting.\r\n\r\nSTATE OF MICHIGAN FORESTRY COMMISSION (extracts from report to\r\ngovernor): The system of taxation should be modified so as to stimulate\r\ntimber production instead of repressing it.\r\n\r\nThere is no logical, moral or political reason why a crop of growing\r\ntrees should be included in the assessment, in addition to the\r\nactual value of the land, that does not apply with equal force and\r\nreason to farm lands which are continuously cropped with grains,\r\nroot crops or hay. The uncertainty of realizing upon a tree crop is\r\nvery much like the uncertainty of a given farm's producing its crop\r\nin full. The only difference is that the forest crop is subjected\r\nto the vicissitudes and chances of a long series of years, while\r\nthe farm crops are subject only to the vicissitudes of about one\r\nyear. Many of the crops are only subject to the accidents of five\r\nor six months.\r\n\r\nIn the present stage of forestry in this country, what is most\r\nimperatively required is such a treatment of the subject of taxation\r\nof forested lands as will induce private owners to retain their\r\nforests until ripe to the harvest and to reforest denuded lands.\r\nThis would apply to those having lands suitable for such purpose,\r\nor others who might purchase lands suitable therefor, who, under the\r\npresent diverse, and oftentimes inequitable, practice of assessments,\r\ncannot be induced to make investments of that character.\r\n\r\nREPORT OF SOCIETY FOR PROTECTION OF NEW HAMPSHIRE FORESTS, EX-GOVERNOR\r\nFRANK W. ROLLINS, President: The law of New Hampshire requires\r\nthat all property shall be taxed equally, according to its value,\r\na law constantly and necessarily violated by assessors of forest\r\nproperty throughout the State. Its strict application even for a\r\nshort period would go far to rid the State of its standing timber.\r\nThe reason for this is that timber is a growing crop--the only crop\r\ntaxed more than once, and if taxed annually at its full value the\r\ncost to the owner of holding the property would be so excessive as to\r\nrequire its hasty disposal. Assessors everywhere feel instinctively\r\nthe inherent injustice of taxing a growing crop at a high annual\r\nrate, and violate the law and their oaths of office with impunity.\r\nThe result is there are as many systems of forest taxation in the\r\nState as there are assessors, and glaring inequalities exist, not\r\nonly between neighboring towns, but also in some instances between\r\ndifferent parts of the same town.\r\n\r\nThe unequally high rate placed upon the timber of non-residents\r\nis wholly iniquitous.\r\n\r\nNEW HAMPSHIRE STATE GRANGE, Committee on Agriculture: Many of the\r\ntowns in our State invite the misuse of forests by overtaxation.\r\nThis should be guarded against. By reasonable thrift we can produce\r\na constant wood and timber supply beyond our own need, and with it\r\nconserve the usefulness of our streams for water supply, navigation\r\nand power, and at the same time increase the value of our farms.\r\n\r\nE. M. GRIFFITH, State Forester of Wisconsin: The present method\r\nof taxing timberlands is hostile to the forestry interests of the\r\nState, as a single timber crop is taxed heavily and repeatedly,\r\nand the owners are forced by our present laws to cut their mature\r\ntimber in order to escape inequitable taxation, to sacrifice their\r\nyoung growth, and to disregard conservative methods of forest\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nTaxes are unfortunately a very valid reason in many sections of\r\nthe State for not practicing forestry. Many town assessors seem\r\nto feel that they must tax the timberland owner, especially the\r\nnon-resident owner, as heavily as possible, and naturally in\r\nself-defense the owner is forced to cut his timber and so reduce\r\nthe taxes to a reasonable amount. Then, when it is too late, the\r\ntowns find that they have \"killed the goose that laid the golden\r\negg.\" However, the loss of the taxes on the timber is but a drop in\r\nthe bucket compared to the irreparable damage to many communities\r\nfrom losing the industries which depended upon the forests for\r\ntheir raw material. To appreciate this one only needs to visit\r\ntowns in which the sawmills have shut down on account of lack of\r\ntimber.\r\n\r\nOf late years the end of the timber has been largely hastened on\r\naccount of the excessive taxes placed upon it. The whole system\r\nof forest taxation in this country is wrong, for it puts a premium\r\non forest destruction.\r\n\r\nRALPH C. HAWLEY, Instructor in Forestry, Yale University: A system\r\nof taxation which discriminates against timber, one of the chief\r\nnatural resources of the commonwealth, is to be condemned.\r\n\r\nKENTUCKY STATE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE REPORT: When a rise in the\r\nvaluation of other than forest property becomes necessary because\r\nof the greater development of the resources of the region, the\r\nvaluation of forest property should be increased with great caution\r\nin order that the forest lands may be held to advantage for the\r\nproduction of future timber crops. A timber crop is marketed only\r\nafter the young growing timber has been held for a long term of\r\nyears, during which time the forest has been yielding only a very\r\nslight revenue, if any, to the owner. If the valuation of the forest\r\nor its rates of taxation goes beyond a comparatively low limit, the\r\nholding of forest land for a second crop of timber is impracticable\r\nor nearly prohibitive. This condition has prevailed in many other\r\nStates where now the problem of taxation is a difficult one to\r\nsolve.\r\n\r\nALFRED GASKILL, State Forester for New Jersey: The present practices\r\nfavor and encourage the untimely or wasteful use of standing forests,\r\ndiscourage the propagation of others, and tend to hasten the time\r\nwhen the country shall be forced to face a wood famine.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to apply the European system here with anything\r\nlike the exactness that attaches to it in the old countries, because\r\nwe have not the means of knowing the true worth of forest soil or\r\nof forest crops, but the principle is applicable anywhere. Even\r\nin the hands of non-expert assessors it gives a fairer basis of\r\nvaluation than our present method, and in the long run will insure\r\nlarger returns.\r\n\r\nJ. E. FROST, Tax Commissioner of Washington: The State's system\r\nof taxation is obsolete, and only 13 civilized communities in the\r\nworld have such an out-of-date system. The State is confined by\r\nthe constitution to property tax, well known as a primitive system,\r\nutterly incapable of coping with modern business. It can be remedied\r\nonly by recognizing the different classes of taxable property.\r\n\r\nDR. FRANCIS L. MCVEY, University President and Tax Expert: Under\r\nthe old plan of valuing annually the property it was difficult to\r\nsecure an appraisement that was satisfactory to anybody and, what was\r\nmore, as the years went by the local governments found their assessed\r\nvalues decreasing and the burden of government materially increasing\r\nwith the decline in amount of standing timber. The annual taxation\r\nof the land upon which the timber stands meets this difficulty,\r\nwhile the taxation of the product at the time of harvesting provides\r\na plan that is fair both to the local government and to the owner\r\nof timber.\r\n\r\nCOLORADO CONSERVATION COMMISSION: _Resolved_, That it is the sense\r\nof the Colorado Conservation Commission that the governor and\r\nlegislators should submit to the people at as early a date as possible\r\nan amendment to the constitution, exempting from taxation lands\r\ndevoted solely to the growth and culture of new timber, and if\r\nsuch amendment is adopted, the same to be followed by suitable\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nOREGON STATE CONSERVATION COMMISSION: Constitutional amendment\r\nand legislation should be invoked to permit a low fixed tax on\r\ncut-over land during the period of no return to the owner, the\r\nState to be compensated by a tax on the crop when cut. Obviously\r\nthis inducement should be offered only to those holders of cut-over\r\nland who will reciprocate by furthering the object sought. The\r\nresult of such a system would be not only perpetuation of the forest\r\nand its attendant industries and payroll, but also a far greater\r\ntax return than the present one of encouraging potential forest\r\nland to become worthless and non-taxable.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATURE OF MINNESOTA: \"Sec. 17 a. Laws may be enacted exempting\r\nlands from taxation for the purpose of encouraging and promoting the\r\nplanting, cultivation and protection of useful forest trees thereon.\"\r\nThis is the text of an act amending the Minnesota constitution\r\npassed by the legislature.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION, Walla, Walla: _Whereas_, The\r\nquestion of holding cut-over forest land for a second crop is of\r\nparamount importance to the State, and\r\n\r\n_Whereas_, This is made impossible on the part of private owners\r\nby our present method of forest taxation, whereby the owner is\r\nobliged to pay an annual tax on the land as well as an annually\r\nrepeated tax on the same growing crop, therefore be it\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That this convention favors such remedial legislation\r\nas will encourage reforestation of privately owned lands, and be\r\nit further\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That it is the sense of this convention that as applied\r\nto reforestation such remedial legislation can be secured by a\r\nplan which will levy an annual tax on the land and an income tax\r\non the forest crop only when the crop is harvested.\r\n\r\nFIRST NATIONAL CONSERVATION CONGRESS, Seattle: Resolved, That we\r\nurge the adoption of a system of taxation under which woodlands\r\nwill pay a moderate annual land tax and the timber will be taxed\r\nonly when cut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WESTERN FORESTRY AND CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\nThe Western Forestry and Conservation Association has no individual\r\nmembership, but consists of and represents all organized agencies\r\nfor forest protection in the States of Montana, Idaho, Washington,\r\nOregon and California. Following is Article IV of its constitution:\r\n\r\n\"Any association formed for the purpose of organized effort in\r\nthe protection of forests from fire and for the reforestation and\r\nconservation of the forest resources of the States represented\r\nshall be eligible for membership. Any organization admitted to\r\nmembership shall be entitled to two votes in the meetings of this\r\nAssociation. The chief forest officer of each of the five States\r\nembraced, and of each district of the United States Forest Service\r\nembraced, shall be honorary members.\"\r\n\r\nThe allied organizations are at present fifteen in number: The\r\nOregon Forest Fire, Oregon Conservation, North Willamette Forest\r\nFire, Coos County Fire Patrol, Northwest Oregon Forest Fire, Klamath\r\nLake Counties Forest Fire, Polk-Yamhill Forest Fire, Lincoln-Benton\r\nForest Fire, North Idaho Forestry, Washington Forest Fire, Washington\r\nConservation, Inland Forest Fire, Potlatch Timber Protective, Clearwater\r\nTimber Protective, Pend d'Oreille Timber Protective, Coeur d'Alene\r\nTimber Protective and Northern Montana Forestry Association.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Western Forestry & Conservation Association is\r\nto promote forest fire prevention, conservative forest management,\r\nreforesting of cut-over lands not more valuable for agriculture,\r\nimprovement in taxation systems, preservation of stream flow, and\r\nall other things comprehended by forest conservation.\r\n\r\nIts meetings enable representatives of the allied associations\r\nand of State and government to exchange ideas and devise ways and\r\nmeans for carrying on these movements in harmony along practical\r\nand effective lines. It also affords means of collecting and\r\ndistributing information from these several sources.\r\n\r\nIt believes in the use of every legitimate means of publicity and\r\neducation to interest lumbermen, legislators and public, not only in\r\npaving the way for future advance, but also in such actual, workable,\r\nconservation measures as can be put into practice immediately.\r\n\r\nTo this end, believing action speaks louder than words, it practices\r\nwhat it preaches. While fully recognizing the great value and necessity\r\nof associations devoted entirely to propaganda, it sees also a need\r\nof reducing theory to a sound business basis. Either as associations\r\nor through their members the forest protective associations it\r\nrepresents spent about $700,000 in 1910 for patrol and fire fighting\r\nto protect the forests of the West. They safeguarded millions of\r\nacres of timber, put out many thousand fires, and saved forest\r\nresources worth billions of dollars to the community. As a result\r\nof their effort the losses in Idaho, Washington and Oregon were\r\nkept down to about a quarter of 1 per cent of the privately-owned\r\ntimber in these States, and this notwithstanding that it was one\r\nof the worst fire years in American history.\r\n\r\nWhile they unite in the Western Forestry and Conservation Association,\r\nand levy a special assessment to support its work, the local\r\norganizations are wholly independent in their actual forest fire\r\nwork. Their systems vary slightly, but the majority follow the\r\ngeneral plan outlined on pages 100-103 of this booklet.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary objects and ambitions of the Association is to\r\nextend this effort until all the timber owners in the five States\r\ndo their part and every acre of private forest land is brought under\r\na highly trained and organized service. If the States themselves\r\nlend aid and backing this can be made the most efficient fire service\r\nin existence, as the most magnificent body of standing timber in\r\nthe world deserves.\r\n\r\nThe Association also employs a trained forester to assist its members\r\nwho control timber to install and maintain improved methods of\r\nprotection, cutting and reforestation. In this way it not only\r\nhelps those who will to really accomplish the end in view, but\r\nby publishing such material as is contained in this booklet makes\r\nthe experiments serve as object lessons to others.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most unique function of the Association is to furnish\r\nthe only common meeting ground and clearing house for the many\r\npublic and private agencies for forest protection. At its meetings\r\nFederal and State officials, representatives of public conservation\r\nassociations and timber owners join on equal footing, without\r\ncontroversy over rights or authority, in discussing practical details\r\nof how to accomplish the best results together under conditions\r\nas they exist. Every man present is there because he wants to do\r\nhis part, with his own hands or money, to preserve the forests of\r\nthe West. He knows what he is talking about and the others are glad\r\nto hear him. The result is a mutual understanding and coöperation\r\nalong practical lines which is of immense benefit to the public whose\r\nwelfare depends largely upon these agencies that really control\r\nits forest resources.",
