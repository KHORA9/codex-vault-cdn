Robson, State Botanist of Kansas, sends THE PRAIRIE FARMER\r\nan extract from his last report, concerning a tame grass for hay and\r\npasturing which is new to that State. The grass has been on trial on an\r\nupland farm for two years, during which time he has watched it very\r\nclosely. The Professor says, \"It possesses so many excellent qualities\r\nas to place it in the front rank of all cultivated grasses.\" He\r\nenumerates from his notes:\r\n\r\n1st. The seed will germinate and grow as easily as common oats. 2d. It\r\nmaintains a deep green color all seasons of the year. 3d. Its roots\r\ndescend deeply into the subsoil, enabling this grass to withstand a\r\nprotracted drouth. 4th. Its early growth in spring makes it equal to rye\r\nfor pasturage. 5th. In the next year after sowing it is ready to cut for\r\nhay, the middle of May--not merely woody stems, but composed in a large\r\nmeasure of a mass of long blades of foliage. The crop of hay can be cut\r\nand cured, and stowed away in stack or barn, long before winter wheat\r\nharvest begins. 6th. It grows quickly after mowing, giving a denser and\r\nmore succulent aftermath than any of the present popular tame grasses.\r\n\r\nFor several years, he says, we have been looking for a grass that would\r\nsupply good grazing to our cattle and sheep after the native grasses\r\nhave become dry and tasteless. In the early portion of 1881, his\r\nattention was called to a tame grass which had been introduced into the\r\nState of Michigan from West Virginia. This forage plant was causing some\r\nexcitement among the farmers in the neighborhood of Battle Creek. So he\r\nentered into a correspondence with a friend living there, and obtained\r\nten pounds of seed for trial. The result has been satisfactory in every\r\nrespect. The seed was sown April 1, 1881. It germinated quickly, and the\r\nyoung plants grew vigorously. During the whole summer they exhibited a\r\ndeep-green color, and did not become brown, like blue-grass, orchard\r\ngrass, or timothy. As soon as the spring of 1882 opened, growth set in\r\nrapidly, and continued till the latter end of May, at which period it\r\nstood from three to four feet high. At this time it was ready for the\r\nmower; but as the production of seed was the object in view, it was not\r\ncut till the second week in June. The plot of ground of about half an\r\nacre, on which ten pounds of seed were sown, produced three barrels of\r\nseed.\r\n\r\nHe exhibited a little sheaf of this grass at the semi-annual meeting of\r\nthe Kansas State Horticultural Society, where it excited much\r\nattention--the height, softness of the stem, length of blade, and sweet\r\naroma surprised every one present.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of August, he went into the plot with a sickle, and cut\r\ntwo handfuls of aftermath which measured twenty inches in growth. This\r\nhe tied to a sheaf of the June cutting, and exhibited the same at the\r\nState Fair, where it attracted much attention and comment.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have, he continues, a grass that will insure a \"good\r\ncatch\" if the seed is fresh; that can endure severe drouth; that\r\nproduces an abundant supply of foliage; that is valuable for pasture in\r\nearly spring, on account of its early and luxuriant growth; that makes a\r\nvaluable hay; that shoots up quickly after being cut; and affords a fine\r\ncrop of aftermath for grazing during the late fall and winter months.\r\n\r\nThe Professor is very anxious that the farmers of Kansas should test\r\nthis grass during the season of 1883. Still, his advice is not to invest\r\ntoo largely in the experiment. Purchase from five to ten pounds of\r\nseed, and give it a fair trial, and he is confident that the experiment\r\nwill be satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe name given to this valuable grass in the State of Michigan is\r\n\"Evergreen,\" but this is only a local synonym. Its scientific name is\r\nAvena elatior; its common name, \"Tall Meadow Oat-grass.\" Fearing that he\r\nmight be mistaken in its nomenclature, he sent a specimen to Professor\r\nCarruth, State Botanist. This is his reply:\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. J.W. Robson--Dear Sir: Yours mailed on the 22d, I\r\n    received last evening. I do not get my mail every day. The\r\n    specimen of grass you sent agrees perfectly with the Avena\r\n    elatior, of Wood, and the Arrenatherrum avenaceum, of Gray;\r\n    but I have never seen this grass before. I agree with you in\r\n    the scientific name, and also in the common name, 'Tall\r\n    Meadow Oat-grass.'\r\n\r\n    Yours truly, J.H. CARRUTH.\"\r\n\r\nThe ground should be plowed in the fall, and early in the spring, as\r\nsoon as the soil is in good tilth; sow broadcast two bushels (or\r\ntwenty-eight pounds) of seed to the acre; cover well with the harrow,\r\nboth lengthways and across the piece of ground sown. Should the ground\r\nprove weedy, cut the weeds down with the mowing machine in June, and\r\nleave them upon the surface, and they will afford shade to the young\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThis grass is extensively grown in Eastern Tennessee, and is very\r\npopular in that portion of the State. In some portions of Western\r\nVirginia it is largely grown for hay and for grass. It is known as tall\r\nmeadow oat-grass in each of the States we have mentioned above.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe main building for the New Orleans Cotton Centennial Exposition next\r\nyear will be 1,500 feet long and 900 feet wide, with 1,000,398 square\r\nfeet of floor space, including Music Hall in the center, with a seating\r\ncapacity of 12,000 persons. The design also provides for main offices,\r\ntelegraph office, newspaper department, fire department, police,\r\nhospital, waiting-rooms, and life saving apparatus. The building will be\r\nthe largest exposition building ever erected, except the one in London\r\nin 1862. The design adopted was the work of G.M. Jorgenson, of Meridian,\r\nMississippi. There were ten competitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH F. GLIDDEN.\r\n\r\nThe Barb-Wire Industry--Some Facts in its Early History not Generally\r\nKnown--Its Growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Farwell Glidden, \"the Father of the Barb-Wire Business\" of this\r\ncountry, is now a hale and hearty man of seventy-one. He was born at\r\nCharleston, N.H. When about one year old the family came West, to\r\nClarendon, Orleans county, New York, and engaged in farming. The young\r\nlad, besides mastering the usual branches taught in the common schools,\r\ngave some time to the higher mathematics and Latin, intending to take a\r\ncollege course, an idea that he finally abandoned. He taught in the\r\ndistrict schools for a few terms. In 1842 he came to Illinois and\r\npurchased a quarter section of land a mile west of what is now the site\r\nof the pleasant and prosperous town of DeKalb. With the exception of\r\nthree years his life since then has been passed upon this farm and at\r\nDeKalb. He has from time to time added to his homestead, his farm now\r\nembracing 800 acres. His land is under excellent cultivation, a\r\nconsiderable portion of it having been thoroughly tiled, and his farm\r\nbuildings are first-class. Mr. Glidden has been twice married. Two\r\nchildren were born of the first union, both dying in infancy. By his\r\nsecond marriage he has one daughter, now the wife of a Chicago merchant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSEPH FARWELL GLIDDEN.]\r\n\r\nMr. Glidden has held several local offices of trust and honor and enjoys\r\nin a marked degree the esteem and confidence of the citizens of his\r\nneighborhood and county. The rapid accumulation of property of late\r\nyears, through his barb-wire patents and business, gave him the means to\r\ngratify his feelings of public spirit, and in consequence the town of\r\nDeKalb has benefited greatly at his hands. Its leading hotel and many\r\nother buildings are the work of his enterprise. Mr. Glidden has never\r\nlost the simple manners of the farm. He is unostentatious, quiet,\r\ngenial, and at his hotel makes everybody feel as much at home as though\r\nenjoying the hospitalities of his private house. His kindly, firm, and\r\nintelligent face is well shown in the accompanying portrait, though, as\r\nis usually the case, the hand of the artist has touched his features\r\nmore lightly than has the hand of time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFew names are now more widely known among the land holders of the\r\ncountry than that of Joseph F. Glidden, the unpretending gentleman whose\r\nlife we have briefly sketched. It was his fortune to seize upon an idea,\r\nand push it to development, which has not only given him fame and\r\nfortune, but which has enriched many others and saved many millions of\r\ndollars to the farmers of America. He has not only founded a mammoth\r\nindustry, but he has revolutionized an economic system of the world. By\r\nhis ingenuity and perseverance the fencing system of a pastoral\r\ncontinent has been reduced to a minimum of expense and simplicity. Not\r\nthat he individually has accomplished all this, but as the patentee of\r\nthe first really successful barb-wire fence, he laid the solid\r\nfoundation for it all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first application for a patent for the Glidden barb was filed\r\nOctober 27, 1873. For some weeks previous to this date Mr. Glidden had\r\nhad in his mind the idea of a barb of wire twisted about the main wire\r\nof the fence, leaving two projecting points on opposite sides. He made\r\nsome of these by hand with the aid of pinchers and hammer. He strung two\r\nwires between two trees and twisted them together with a stick placed\r\nbetween them. A pair of cutting nippers was the next addition to his\r\n\"kit\" of tools. His next means for twisting the two wires together was\r\nthe grindstone--attaching one end of the wire to shaft and crank, the\r\nothers being fastened to the wall of the barn. And here, as in most\r\nthings great and small in this world, woman furnished the motor power.\r\nThe strong arm of the good helpmeet, Mrs. Glidden, turned the grindstone\r\nthat twisted the first wire that made the first Glidden barb fence that\r\nkept stock at bay in Illinois or the world. Then followed a device for\r\ntwisting and barbing, and the application of horse power. Business\r\nexpanded, and steam took the place of the horse, and inventive genius\r\nmodified and improved the entire machinery, it being estimated that at\r\nleast the sum of $1,000,000 has been expended in bringing the machinery\r\nfor barb-wire making to its present state of perfection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt about the same time that Mr. Glidden was wrestling with his ideas and\r\ndevices, Mr. I.L. Ellwood was experimenting to accomplish a like result\r\nwith a thin band of metal, the barbs cut and curved outward from the\r\nstrip. In the meantime Mr. Glidden had put up a few rods of his\r\nhand-made barb-wire along the roadside at his farm. And here again the\r\ngood genius of woman enters upon the scene. One Sunday Mr. Ellwood and\r\nhis wife were driving along this road and attracted by the wire fence\r\nstopped to examine it. Mrs. Ellwood, much to the chagrin of her husband,\r\nremarked: \"This seems to me a better device than your own, don't it to\r\nyou?\" It did not then, for the remark disappointed and angered him. But\r\nit set him to thinking and before the next morning he was of the same\r\nopinion. The two men meeting the next day it did not take long to\r\ncompromise and unite. Mr. Ellwood dropped his own plans and accepted a\r\nhalf interest in the Glidden patents, and assumed the management of the\r\nbusiness end of the concern, in which position he developed ability and\r\ntact possessed by few business men in this country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe barb-wire fence met an unexpected and general demand. We know of few\r\nthings like it in the history of manufactures. From this small\r\nbeginning, scarce ten years ago more than fifty large establishments are\r\nnow turning out this wire to meet an ever insatiate demand. The\r\nestablishment of I.L. Ellwood (making the Glidden wire) at DeKalb is the\r\nmost complete and extensive of them all. The building is 800 feet in\r\nlength, and is supplied with about 200 machines for twisting and barbing\r\nthe wire. It gives, when running full force, employment to about 400\r\nmen, and turns out a car-load of wire each hour for ten hours per day,\r\non an average, though this amount is considerably increased at certain\r\ntimes of the year. These figures, though not given us by Mr. Ellwood, we\r\nare satisfied do not overstate the production of this one factory. The\r\nprogress of the barb-wire industry of the whole country is shown by the\r\nfollowing record of the past nine seasons. In\r\n\r\n  1874 there were 10,000 lb made and sold.\r\n  1875 there were 600,000 lb made and sold.\r\n  1876 there were 2,840,000 lb made and sold.\r\n  1877 there were 12,863,000 lb made and sold.\r\n  1878 there were 26,655,000 lb made and sold.\r\n  1879 there were 50,337,000 lb made and sold.\r\n  1880 there were 80,500,000 lb made and sold.\r\n  1881 there were 120,000,000 lb made and sold.\r\n  1882 there were about 180,000,000 lb.\r\n\r\nThe record for 1883 is not yet made up, but will probably show a\r\ncorresponding increase.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 Mr. Glidden disposed of his half interest in the concern of\r\nGlidden & Ellwood to the Washburn & Moen (wire) Manufacturing Company,\r\nof Massachusetts, receiving therefor $60,000 in cash and a royalty on\r\nthe future goods manufactured, Mr. Ellwood retaining his interest. The\r\nnew concern began the purchase of prior unused and conflicting patents\r\ninvolving itself in extensive litigation, but, sustained by the courts,\r\nsoon gained control of almost the entire barb-wire business of the\r\ncountry. Nearly all wire-making companies are now running under license\r\nfrom the parent concern.

Since then, as production has increased and the\r\nfacilities for manufacturing have been multiplied and perfected, the\r\nprice has gradually dropped, until now a farm can be well fenced for\r\nforty-five cents, or less, per rod, and to the incalculable advantage of\r\nthe country over fencing by posts and boards, hedges or rails, as any\r\none may see by a simple dollar and cent comparison of materials at his\r\nown door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBarb-wire has done much for the city of DeKalb. It has built its fine\r\nbusiness blocks and residences, and it has peopled it with industrious,\r\nthrifty citizens. It has made a home market for many of the products of\r\nthe country 'round about. It should give a new name, \"Barb City,\" to the\r\nbustling, busy town. There are three concerns now making barb-wire at\r\nthis point. The one spoken of is the largest. Next is that of Jacob\r\nHaish, an extensive establishment, turning out an excellent wire, and\r\nthe Superior, run by Mr. Hiram Ellwood, Mr. Glidden having a\r\nconsiderable interest in it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. I.L. Ellwood is the owner of some 2,600 acres of land in the\r\nvicinity of DeKalb. Much of this land is naturally low and wet. The\r\nproprietor, with his accustomed energy and intelligence, has set\r\nvigorously to work to reclaim it. To this end he has already laid eighty\r\nmiles of tile. He last year expended nearly $15,000 in this work. His\r\npoorest land is rapidly becoming his most productive. Mr. Ellwood has\r\nalso turned his attention somewhat to horse-breeding, and he is now the\r\nowner of a fine stud of draft-horses, the equal of many better-known\r\nestablishments of the kind in the State. Of his drainage operations we\r\nhope to speak more in detail in a future number.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Glidden told the writer that his first trial of his fence with stock\r\nwas not undertaken without some misgivings. But he thought to himself,\r\n\"It will stop them, at any rate, whether it kills them or not.\" So he\r\ntook down an old board fence from one side of his barn-yard, and towards\r\nnight when his stock came up, turned them into the yard as usual. The\r\nfirst animal to investigate the almost invisible barrier to freedom was\r\na strong, heavy grade Durham cow. She walked along beside the wires for\r\na little put her nose out and touched a barb, withdrew it and took a\r\nwalk around the yard, approached the wires again and gave the barbs a\r\nlap with her tongue. This settled the matter, and she retired, convinced\r\nthat the new-fangled fence was a success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBarb-wire is now sent from this country to Mexico, South America, and\r\nAustralia. It is also being manufactured in England under American\r\nauspices.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Glidden, associating with himself a Mr. Sanborn, a young man of push\r\nand enterprise, has opened up an extensive cattle ranch in Potter and\r\nRandall counties, Texas. They have fenced with wire a tract thirty miles\r\nlong by about fifteen miles broad, and have now upon it 14,000 head of\r\ncattle. Two twisted No. 11 wires were used for this fence, and the posts\r\nare the best that could be procured. The wire was taken 200 miles on\r\nwagons. The total cost of the completed fence was about $36,000.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMessrs. Glidden & Ellwood put up the first barb-wire ever used by a\r\nrailway company--the Northwestern. So great was the caution of the\r\ncompany that the manufacturers built it themselves, agreeing to remove\r\nit if it proved unsatisfactory. The railway folks feared it would injure\r\nstock, the damages for which they would be forced to pay. It is needless\r\nto say that the fence was not removed. More than one hundred railway\r\ncompanies are now using the Glidden wire, and it stretches along many\r\nthousands of miles of track.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA RAMBLER'S LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to call your attention to the fact that there is\r\nconsiderable cholera among swine in Dewey township, Ill., west from\r\nJoliet. Mr. Cooter lost about 130 hogs. Other farmers have suffered\r\nequally.\r\n\r\nI have been looking over the stock in this part of the country and find\r\nit excellent, as a general thing. Many of the farmers are breeders of\r\nfine Hereford cattle. They also own first-class horses. Some of them\r\nwhom I called upon would like to know the address of State Veterinary\r\nSurgeon Dr. Paaren, and I should be pleased if you will give it in THE\r\nPRAIRIE FARMER.[A] I have often thought, Why is it that so many sons of\r\nwealthy farmers leave their homes for the purpose of either studying in\r\nsome classical college, to learn a trade, or to become book-keepers and\r\nclerks in mercantile business. I think if farmers would take more\r\ninterest in agricultural papers, instead of having their children\r\nfooling away their time on novels or comic stories and pictures, it\r\nwould be better for both old and young. Let the parents buy a microscope\r\nand let the young folks examine insects and fungi of all kinds, and let\r\nthem write their experiences down in a book whenever there is leisure\r\ntime. Or let them write to THE PRAIRIE FARMER something in the line of\r\nfarming, be it agriculture, horticulture, or about raising and caring\r\nfor stock. In so doing the boys of our farming country will become proud\r\nof their noble profession and of their homes. They will gradually be, as\r\nevery farmer should be, educated up to the times. There are few farmers\r\nwho can afford to let their sons study in an agricultural university,\r\nbut every one can surely afford to subscribe for an agricultural paper,\r\nit being one of the most profitable investments for himself and family.\r\n\r\nThe ground is covered with snow to a small extent, and the roads are in\r\na fine condition. The crops are all good here except corn, which is very\r\npoor indeed, even the crop in most cases is small. Farmers are not at\r\nall satisfied, and times are not at all encouraging.\r\n\r\n  H.A.P. WEISSBERGER.\r\n  WILL CO., ILL.\r\n\r\n[A] 355 Western Avenue (south), Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FARMER'S LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs this is the season to make up our list of papers and magazines for\r\nthe ensuing year, I will take a glance around my own cosy room set apart\r\nfor a library.\r\n\r\nIt is here that I do the most of my reading, writing, and planning; and\r\nalthough I pretend to be deeply engaged while ensconced in the large\r\nwillow rocker, strictly forbidding entrance to my farmer office, yet the\r\nchildren and \"Spot,\" my Gordon setter, will intrude, making things\r\nlively for awhile, driving my thoughts wool-gathering and breaking many\r\na thread of thought that I had fondly hoped would place my name high on\r\nthe roll of scribblers. It is a good thing to have the little innocent\r\nchildren and the dog to blame for these shortcomings, as they can not\r\ntake issue with us on the question.\r\n\r\nBut I started to talk about a farmer's library; and taking my own for a\r\nsmall sample, let us see how it looks.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of keeping my papers in order, I have prepared thin\r\nlaths of tough wood dressed with the draw knife to a thin edge, the back\r\nbeing one fourth of an inch thick, leaving the lath one and a quarter\r\ninch broad; these are cut in lengths to suit the paper they are intended\r\nto hold. Take for instance THE PRAIRIE FARMER. I cut the lath just two\r\ninches longer than the paper is long, then cut notches half of an inch\r\nfrom each end, in which I tie the ends of a cord; this forms a loop to\r\nhang up the file. In this I file each paper so soon as read, by which\r\nmeans they are never lost or mislaid. When at the end of each three\r\nmonths the papers are taken from off the file, the oldest number is laid\r\nface down on a broad piece of plank and the number that follows laid\r\nface down on the top of the first, then they are squared evenly and a\r\nstrong awl pierces three holes in the back edge through which a strong\r\ntwine string is laced and tied firmly; this finishes the job, and the\r\nbook thus simply and quickly made is placed on the shelf with its mates.\r\nThis done the file is returned to its hook to await the next number.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple plan for filing papers of any size, and any farmer can\r\ndo it, there being no expense or outlay for material. On glancing up\r\nfrom the stand on which I am writing, the first objects that attract my\r\nnotice are my breach loader, cartridge belt, and game-bag hanging on the\r\nwall; then by the side of the stove hangs the file of THE PRAIRIE\r\nFARMER, within easy reach of my left hand; next it swings the\r\nCountry Gentleman, then comes the Forest and Stream, then Colman's Rural\r\nWorld, then the Drainage Journal; next Harper's Weekly, then Harper's\r\nBazar. This is my wife's paper and she persists in hanging it among\r\nmine. Then comes Harper's Monthly and the Century, not forgetting the\r\nSanitary Journal. On the other side of the room we find the Inter Ocean,\r\nDemocrat, and several other political papers fairly representing both\r\nsides, also some standard books of valuable information; and last but\r\nnot least, the PRAIRIE FARMER Map which you sent for my club.\r\n\r\nNow, this may be considered a pretty large outlay for a common farmer to\r\nmake, but outside of life insurance, I consider it my best investment.\r\n\r\nIn this selection I get the cream of all matters of practical importance\r\nto the farmer. From THE PRAIRIE FARMER I get the latest and most\r\nreliable information of the great central ruling markets of the West\r\nChicago, which has saved me sundry times from three to five cents per\r\nbushel on wheat, sometimes paying the price of the paper twenty times\r\nover in one transaction. From the C.G. I get the Eastern markets, while\r\nColman gives the St. Louis; and by a close study of the three a farmer\r\ncan always make enough to pay for twenty or thirty dollars worth of good\r\ncurrent literature for the use of his family. Then the F. and S. is\r\nalways full of delightful reading for the boys, refining their cruel\r\npropensities, and teaching them to be kind to the feathered tribe which\r\nare the farmer's friends. By reading it they soon lay aside their traps,\r\nnets, and snares, with which they capture whole covies of the dear\r\nlittle Bob-whites, and disdain to touch a feather, only when on the\r\nwing, and then with their light, hammerless breach loader. Such reading\r\nas that ties the farmer's boys to country life, and makes them contented\r\nunder the parental roof-tree until they are ready to build up homes of\r\ntheir own. The Journal tells them all about tile making and drainage, a\r\nvery necessary accomplishment when they get their own homestead.\r\n\r\nThe pictures in H.W. furnish a fountain of amusement for the little\r\nfolks, and teach them--with a little help--many things that will be\r\nuseful to them in life. As a matter of course the \"Bezar\" is for mother\r\nand the girls, and [***]\r\nconsultations [***]\r\nbefore the fair, a [***]\r\ndaughters, your [***]\r\ngood when she insisted [***]\r\nbe put on the list.\r\n\r\nA boy or a girl with [***]\r\nthe Century in their hands, [***]\r\nroom, with a bright clear lamp [***]\r\nhas no thought of city life, or [***]\r\nIn those bright pages the [***]\r\nouter world painted in all its various [***]\r\nso interesting and so fascinating [***]\r\nhave no desire to see it in reality; in [***]\r\nthey bring the brightest and best thought, [***]\r\nhistoric, and romantic to our hearth and home; furnishing food for the\r\nyouthful minds, leaving no room for evil or discontented thoughts to\r\nenter. Then I say to every farmer who has children, get the magazines\r\nfor them, they will save you a mountain of trouble.\r\n\r\nThen to balance things have one or two spicy news papers, which picture\r\nin horrid colors the blackest side of human life. This is necessary to\r\nguard the young against the riff-raff of humanity, such as tramps,\r\nsharpers, sewing machine and book agents, the lightning rod man, and a\r\ndozen other sharp swindlers that prey on the farmer and his family for\r\nan existence. The Sanitary Journal treats of health, purity, and\r\ncleanliness, and ought to be read and studied by all. Ah, I had almost\r\nforgotten THE PRAIRIE FARMER Map which hangs by the door. What can I say\r\nabout it? that it is a handsome ornament for a living room or library?\r\nyes, but that is not all, it is useful. When it arrived I took it to the\r\nrailroad office and compared it with the best map they had, also with a\r\nmap made by the U.S. land office. I came away satisfied that it was\r\nreliable; it ought to be in the home of every farmer in this great\r\ncountry of ours, so that their children can learn and know what a grand\r\nheritage they have got. There is no excuse for being without it, as a\r\nfew pounds of butter or dozens of eggs will procure it and a paper that\r\nwill gladden the hearts of both old and young.\r\n\r\n  ALEX ROSS.\r\n  CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLET US BE SOCIABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA happy new year to all of the readers of THE PRAIRIE FARMER, and may\r\nyour labors of 1884 be crowned with success. Mr. Granger, what are you\r\ndoing these long winter evenings? Can't you find time to write a few\r\nlines to the readers of THE PRAIRIE FARMER? You can send a little report\r\nfrom your county, at least. Come, let us be a little more sociable and\r\ntalk more to each other through the columns of our paper. We can learn\r\nsomething by reading each other's views on different subjects. In my\r\nnext I shall try and tell some of the careless fellows how to run a farm\r\nto make it pay. If I fail to give a little light on the subject perhaps\r\nsome one else will try it. We are having what you might call winter,\r\nnow. Snow is about six inches deep, but the weather is not very cold.\r\nThe thermometer has not been below zero but once. Nearly all of the corn\r\nis gathered; only about one-third of the crop is sound enough to keep\r\nuntil next summer. Farmers are feeding their soft corn to hogs and\r\ncattle. In that way the soft corn will pay pretty well after all, for\r\nfat stock brings a good price. Stock cattle are wintering well, for feed\r\nin the fields is good, and most farmers have got plenty of good hay. The\r\nweather was so nice the first part of this month that the farmers did a\r\nlarge amount of plowing. Potatoes are plenty and cheap; worth from 30 to\r\n40 cents. Apples are scarce, and good ones bring a big price. Butter is\r\nworth from 25 to 30 cents.\r\n\r\n  S.O.A.\r\n  KNOX CO., ILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED CORN AGAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has been much complaint of soft corn in this section on account of\r\nplanting foreign seed last spring, but it is all solid since the late\r\ncold spell.\r\n\r\nThose who planted seed of their own raising and got a stand have fair\r\ncorn, while much of that which was raised from Kansas and Nebraska seed\r\nwas caught by the frost when in the milk. Now we will be in just the\r\nsame \"fix\" about seed next spring that we were last. This county has\r\nlost thousands of dollars this year in the corn crop alone, all of which\r\nmight have been avoided by going through the fields before freezing\r\nweather and selecting seed and properly drying it before it froze.\r\n\r\nAnd now right here I want to say that the great secret of good farming\r\nis simply being punctual in attending to the small matters, and I\r\n\"guess\" Fanny Field would say the same about poultry.\r\n\r\n  Z.L. THOMPSON.\r\n  IROQUOIS CO., ILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEMBER _that $2.00 pays for_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER _from this\r\ndate to January 1, 1885; For $2.00 you get it for one year and a\r\ncopy of_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER COUNTY MAP OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\nFREE! _This is the most liberal offer ever made by any first-class\r\nweekly agricultural paper in this country._\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD AND FURROW.\r\n\r\n\r\nSays the Iowa Register: One hundred bushels of corn will shrink to\r\nninety in the crib, and to an extent more than that, depending on the\r\nopenness of the crib and the honesty of the neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural editor of the New York Times says that no doubt many\r\nfarmers who are intending to underdrain their farms would save money by\r\nemploying an expert at the first to lay out the whole system and make a\r\ngood beginning, and so avoid any possible mistake, which might cost ten\r\ndollars for every one paid for skilled advice.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times says that lime seems to be a preventive of rot in\r\npotatoes in the cellar. Some potatoes that were rotting and were picked\r\nout of a heap of forty or fifty bushels were put into a corner and well\r\ndusted with air-slaked lime. They stopped rotting at once, and the\r\ndecayed parts are now dried up. There is no disagreeable smell about\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nCincinnati Gazette: It is remarked that when young hogs are fed mainly\r\non corn they stop growing at an early age and begin to grow fat; but\r\nthat green food makes them thriftier and larger than dry grain. In fact,\r\nit is better to prevent all domestic animals from becoming very fat\r\nuntil they have attained a fair natural size, particularly breeding\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nA member of the Elmira Farmers' Club recently expressed the opinion that\r\nbad results would always be found with wheat sown on land into which the\r\ngreen growth of any crop had just been turned, although it was believed\r\nthat buckwheat was the worst green manure. All green growth incorporated\r\nwith the soil near the time of seeding will in all cases be found\r\nprejudicial to wheat.\r\n\r\nIt is announced that Robert Clarke, of Cincinnati will have ready, in\r\nFebruary, an extensive work on sorghum, containing the results of the\r\nlatest experiments and experience of the most successful growers, as to\r\nthe best varieties and their culture, and also the details of the latest\r\nand best machinery used in the economical manufacture of sirups and\r\nsugars therefrom. The work is by Prof. Peter Collier, whose name is a\r\nguarantee of the value of the book. It will be very fully illustrated.\r\n\r\nA Michigan man writes the Michigan Farmer: I have noticed tarred twine\r\nand willows recommended for binding corn stalks. I think I can propose a\r\nbetter substitute than either for those who are using a twine binder:\r\nsave the strings from straw stacks this winter. They are less trouble\r\nthan grass and never slip. Tie a knot in the end of the twine with your\r\nknee on the bundle, then slip the other end through in the form of a\r\nbow, take off your knee and the spring of the bundle will draw the knot\r\ntight. Pull the bow and use again.\r\n\r\n\"Human labor,\" says Dr. Zellner, of Ashville, Ala., \"is the most costly\r\nfactor that enters into the production of cotton, and every consistent\r\nmeans should be adopted to dispense with it.\" And then the doctor, who\r\nhas the reputation of having raised some of the finest samples ever\r\ngrown in the South, describes how, by planting at proper distances, in\r\nchecks five by three apart, one-half of the after labor of cultivating\r\nmay be saved. About the same amount of plow work is said to be\r\nnecessary, but not more than one-fourth as much work with the hoe as is\r\nrequired by cotton in drills.\r\n\r\nProf. J.W. Sanborn: \"Deep tillage in times of drought of surface-rooted\r\ncrops, like corn, is an erroneous practice, founded on erroneous views.\r\n'Plowing out corn' not only involves too deep tillage in drought but\r\nadds to the mischief by severing the roots of corn, needed at such\r\ntimes. Our double-shovel plows work too deeply. Our true policy, in\r\ndrought, for corn is frequent and shallow tillage. For this we now have\r\nafter the corn gets beyond the smoothing harrow, no suitable implement\r\non our markets, with a possible exception.\"\r\n\r\nCorrespondent New York Tribune: Of the use of oatmeal for cows mention\r\nis not often made in this country; but when spoken of it is always with\r\npraise. That it is better than corn meal there can be no doubt; it is\r\nricher in both albuminoids and fat; and the usefulness of these two\r\nnutriments, and especially the former, for making milk is shown not\r\nonly by the results of numerous careful experiments, but by the\r\nacknowledged usefulness of oil-cake meal. Where this meal is used freely\r\nthere would be less use for oatmeal; but under some circumstances it\r\nmight be advantageously substituted for the bran in the favorite mixture\r\nfor cows of Indian meal and bran.\r\n\r\nThe following paragraph appears in an English cotemporary: The\r\nintroduction of a new industry connected with farming into Ireland will\r\nbe hailed by everybody, and therefore we rejoice to learn that a company\r\nhas been formed with the design of purchasing or renting nearly a\r\nmillion and a quarter acres of land in Ireland, and devoting them to\r\nbeet culture, from which the sugar will be extracted in a manufactory\r\nerected on the land. The promoters of the new company expect that from\r\nthe 120,000 acres which they propose cultivating they will produce\r\n400,000 tons of sugar in the year. Immense quantities of sugar extracted\r\nfrom the beet-root are manufactured on the continent and imported into\r\nthese countries, and there is no reason whatever why Ireland should not\r\nhave her finger in the sugar pie.\r\n\r\nIn a paper before the Oxford (Ohio) Farmers' Club, on the subject \"The\r\nMorality of the System of Grain Gambling,\" Mr. Wetmore said: There is a\r\ndifference between speculation and investment. Putting money into an\r\nestablished industry is an investment. Putting it into a doubtful or\r\nuntried business, with the hope of gaining much or risk of losing all,\r\nis speculation. The latter is infatuating as it increases the risk and\r\nyet turns to profit. Investments pay no high per cents. Speculations may\r\npay much or lose all. Hence it is unsafe; and the farmer who makes his\r\ngains only by a yearly turn of his crops, should not try speculation,\r\nbut may judiciously invest his surplus year by year in things of real\r\nvalue, as land or chattels. Invest the last dollar, but speculate only\r\nwith loose change. No man can safely invest in a business with which he\r\nis not familiar.\r\n\r\nA lawful wire fence in Georgia is described by legislative enactment as\r\ncomposed of not less than six horizontal strands of barbed wire tightly\r\nstretched from post to post. The first wire no more than four and a half\r\nnor less than three and a half inches from the ground; the second wire\r\nnot more than nine and a half nor less than eight and a half inches from\r\nthe ground; the third wire not more than fifteen and a half nor less\r\nthan fourteen and a half inches from the ground; the fourth wire not\r\nmore than twenty-two and a half nor less than twenty-one and a half\r\ninches from the ground; the fifth wire not more than thirty-two nor less\r\nthan thirty-one inches from the ground; the sixth wire not over\r\nfifty-five nor less than fifty-three inches from the ground. Posts to be\r\nnot over ten feet apart, and every alternate post to be securely set in\r\nthe ground. Provided, a plank not less than ten inches wide shall be\r\nused instead of two strands of wire at bottom of fence, it is also\r\nrequired that a railing shall be placed at equal distance between the\r\ntwo top wires, which shall answer the same purpose as a wire, and to\r\nextend from post to post in like manner.\r\n\r\nCorrespondent Country Gentleman: I notice that your journal recently\r\ngave currency to the \"saltpetre method\" of extracting stumps, and W.H.\r\nWhite also recommends it in your columns. His method is to bore a hole\r\nin the stump in the fall of the year, fill in the hole with saltpetre,\r\nplug up till the following summer, then fill the hole with kerosene and\r\nfire the stump. It is alleged that the saltpetre and kerosene will so\r\nsaturate the stump that it will be entirely consumed, roots and all.\r\nThis recipe has been floating around the press for years. It is usually\r\ncredited to the Scientific American, but that paper has several times\r\ndenied its paternity. The uselessness of the process can easily be\r\nlearned by trial. There are few more inflammable substances than pitch\r\nand turpentine. The roots of pine stumps are saturated with these, but\r\nit is impossible to burn them out. The addition of saltpetre would not\r\nhelp much. Yet there are seasons when the soil and air are so dry that\r\nhard wood stumps may be burned out without either saltpetre or kerosene.\r\nWe had such a year in 1881, when corn and clover standing uncut in the\r\nfield were burned. In some instances the curbing was burned out of wells\r\nduring terrible forest fires that raged in Michigan. If tried in such a\r\nseason the recipe would undoubtedly be successful. In any ordinary\r\nseason it is \"no good.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo matter how wretched a man may be, he is still a member of our common\r\nspecies, and if he possesses any of the common specie his acquaintance\r\nis worth having.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFARM MACHINERY, Etc.\r\n\r\nGREAT SAVING FOR FARMERS.\r\n\r\nTHE\r\nLightning\r\nHay Knife!\r\n\r\n(WEYMOUTH'S PATENT.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAwarded \"FIRST ORDER OF Merit\" at Melbourne Exhibition, 1880.\r\n\r\nWas awarded the FIRST PREMIUM at the International Exhibition in\r\nPhiladelphia, 1876, and accepted by the Judges as SUPERIOR TO ANY OTHER\r\nKNIFE IN USE.\r\n\r\nIt is the BEST KNIFE in the _world_ to cut _fine feed_ from bale, to\r\ncut down _mow_ or _stack_, to cut _corn-stalks_ for feed, to cut _peat_,\r\nor for ditching in marshes, and has no equal for cutting ensilage from\r\nthe silo.

To accomplish which we will give absolutely free a genuine\r\nFIRST WATER Diamond Ring, and the Home Companion for one year, for\r\nonly $2.00. Our reasons for making this unprecedented offer are as\r\nfollows;\r\n\r\nA newspaper with 200,000 subscribers can get 1c. per line per 1,000 of\r\ncirculation for its advertising space, or $5,000 per issue MORE than\r\nit costs to produce and mail the paper. With but 10,000 or 20,000\r\nsubscribers, its advertising revenues do not pay expenses. Only the\r\npapers with mammoth circulations make fortunes for their owners,\r\nDERIVED FROM ADVERTISING SPACE. For these and other reasons, we regard\r\n100,000 subscribers as being of more financial benefit to a paper than\r\nthe paper is to the subscribers. With 100,000 or 200,000 bona-fide\r\nsubscribers, we make $100,000 to $200,000 a year clear profit from\r\nadvertising, above cost of publishing. Without a large circulation, we\r\nwould lose money.

Write for Your Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. GRINNELL'S LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast week we briefly noted the fact that Hon. J.B. Grinnell, of Iowa,\r\nSecretary of the Committee of the National Cattle-Growers' Convention,\r\nappointed to secure legislation for the protection of live stock from\r\ncontagious diseases, had issued a circular letter to the public. In this\r\nletter he discusses with his usual intelligence and ability the\r\nimportant question in hand. As it will form the basis of Congressional\r\ndiscussion and prove an important factor in shaping legislation, we give\r\nthe letter space in our columns. Mr. Grinnell says:\r\n\r\n    To find a legitimate market for our surplus products is a\r\n    question of grave concern. After meeting home demands the\r\n    magnitude of foreign consumption determines in a large degree\r\n    the net profits of production. It thus becomes the especial\r\n    concern of the American agriculturist and statesman to find\r\n    the best market for meat products. The profits in\r\n    grain-raising for exportation, which impoverishes the soil,\r\n    are exceptional, while our animal industries enrich it,\r\n    augmenting the rural population in the line of true economy,\r\n    the promotion of good morals, and the independence and\r\n    elevation of the citizen. Under the laws of domestic animal\r\n    life gross farm products and rich, indigenous grasses are\r\n    condensed into values adapted to transportation across oceans\r\n    and to various climes with little waste or deterioration;\r\n    thus the brute a servant, becomes an auxiliary to the cunning\r\n    hand of his master, blending the factors which determine our\r\n    facilities for acquisition in rural life, and attractions\r\n    which stimulate enterprise, adventure, individual\r\n    independence, and contribute to National wealth.\r\n\r\n    THE MEAT PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\n    No nation has so large a relative portion of its wealth in\r\n    domestic animals, and none can show such strides in material\r\n    advancement during the present century. But what is our\r\n    foreign trade? The exports of provisions from the United\r\n    States during the last fiscal year were in value about\r\n    $107,000,000. Those in 1882 amounted to $120,000,000, equal\r\n    to a falling off in a single year of $13,000,000. Our exports\r\n    of manufactured articles for the last year aggregate\r\n    $211,000,000, against $103,000,000, a gain of $108,000,000 in\r\n    a single year. It was a reasonable expectation that our\r\n    animal exports would have increased in like ratio as the\r\n    manufactures, which would have enhanced the value of all\r\n    domestic animals and furnished, instead of a mortifying fact,\r\n    a proud exhibit.\r\n\r\n    The causes of a decline are not found in high prices at home\r\n    nor in inferior product; rather in suspicions of diseases,\r\n    and the clamor of interested parties which led to arbitrary\r\n    restrictions, oppressive quarantine regulations, and\r\n    forbidding beeves which were ripened for the highest markets\r\n    to pass beyond the shambles; and the egress of young immature\r\n    cattle on the English pastures. Pork products up to the\r\n    Chicago meeting were prohibited by France, and they are\r\n    inhibited now from Germany, our long-time valuable customer.\r\n    It was their whims, caprices, jealousies, commercial\r\n    restrictions and bans which decreased our exports and led the\r\n    Commissioner of Agriculture to call the Chicago meeting of\r\n    November.\r\n\r\n    The convention developed facts and was fruitful in results:\r\n    That there were solitary cases of pleuro-pneumonia, and\r\n    limited to the eastern border States; that Western herdsmen\r\n    had just cause of alarm on account of the shipment of young\r\n    stock West from the narrow pastures and dairy districts of\r\n    the East. It was shown that across the ocean there was a\r\n    morbid appetite for suspicions and facts which would justify\r\n    severe restrictions and an absolute inhibition of our\r\n    products.\r\n\r\n    The Cattle Commission formed by the Treasury Department gave\r\n    decided opinions and imparted valuable information, but they\r\n    were constrained to admit that they were powerless in an\r\n    emergency to stop the spread of contagious diseases, and that\r\n    it was a vain hope that there would be an increased foreign\r\n    demand for our cattle and meat without radical Congressional\r\n    enactment.\r\n\r\n    Skilled veterinarians, fancy breeders, political economists,\r\n    and savants from the East met the alarmed ranchmen,\r\n    enterprising breeders, and delegations and officials from\r\n    many agricultural and State associations, representing\r\n    millions of cattle and hundreds of millions of dollars,\r\n    resolved that a meeting should be held at Washington, and a\r\n    committee was appointed to secure appropriate legislation.\r\n\r\n    In the discharge of duties assigned to the Secretary I at\r\n    once repaired to Washington for consultation and to gather\r\n    pertinent facts. The heads of the State Treasury and\r\n    Agricultural Departments were awake to the necessity of early\r\n    and radical legislation. President Arthur evinced great\r\n    cordiality, and gave good proof of his interest by calling\r\n    attention in the annual message to the approaching meeting in\r\n    Washington, which I have called the 10th of January.\r\n\r\n    FACTS.\r\n\r\n    I have sent out in a circular to the committee the following\r\n    \"head-land\" facts of startling import, which should be well\r\n    considered:\r\n\r\n    1. That there is an investment of $1,008,000,000 in cattle as\r\n    estimated by the Department of Agriculture, representing\r\n    41,171,000 animals. That of swine is $291,000,000,\r\n    representing over 43,000,000 animals.\r\n\r\n    2. That losses annually on exportation of cattle and beef,\r\n    consequent upon restrictive regulations and the decreased\r\n    relative consumption of our beef, aggregates many millions of\r\n    dollars. We reach an approximate estimate by these facts\r\n    relative to our foreign trade as follows:\r\n\r\n    The exports of 1880-81 were 368,463 animals. Those of 1882-83\r\n    were 212,554--a loss of 155,009 animals, and in value a loss\r\n    of $11,506,000 in two years.\r\n\r\n    The exports of fresh beef for two years were less by\r\n    40,071,167 pounds, and by a value of $2,191,190. The value of\r\n    pork products decreased in the same time to the extent of\r\n    $35,679,093.\r\n\r\n    This shows a falling off of about $25,000,000 per annum for\r\n    two years, as compared with the receipts for the two\r\n    preceding years.\r\n\r\n    CONTAGION TO BE AVERTED.\r\n\r\n    It should be known that the pleuro-pneumonia often mentioned\r\n    as a scare or a myth by the thoughtless and optimist is a\r\n    stern reality. Its journeys and track of destruction among\r\n    cattle have been as marked as that of small pox and\r\n    cholera--contagious diseases which have so tearfully\r\n    decimated the human family. Lung diseases of the modern type\r\n    were known before the Christian era, and were considered by\r\n    Columella and other Latin writers. Australia resigned her\r\n    great herds to flocks of sheep, as did South Africa, never\r\n    yet recovered from the blow to her cattle industries.\r\n\r\n    England has been tardy in the publication of her losses by\r\n    lung-fever, yet it is a fact which forbids secrecy that\r\n    calamity has reached the enterprising breeders, and colossal\r\n    fortunes have been swept away by the cattle-plague. In our\r\n    own country it has been no more the policy of secretive\r\n    owners to publish facts than that of city authorities to\r\n    proclaim the prevalence of small-pox in the town. Still,\r\n    startling facts have sprung from original sources of inquiry.\r\n    A town meeting is called in the State of Connecticut,\r\n    terror-stricken owners in New Jersey, Maryland, and\r\n    Pennsylvania meet for council. Massachusetts had a Governor\r\n    twenty years ago bold in telling truth, which led to\r\n    searching investigations by experts and officers of the\r\n    State. With autocratic power they made a diagnosis of\r\n    diseases, which led to the stamping out of the infection by\r\n    law, and a truthful proclamation that the plague was stayed.\r\n\r\n    The sacrifice of 1,000 brutes at a cost to the Commonwealth\r\n    of about $70,000 was a trivial sum compared to the perils\r\n    that beset a State valuation of $7,000,000, for bovines, and\r\n    the cattle of the Nation, numbering 40,000,000, and worth\r\n    nearly $1,100,000,000.\r\n\r\n    The monarchies of the Old World have set us an example; even\r\n    Denmark, Norway, and Sweden have pioneered for the world by\r\n    sagacious acts and the stern enforcement of law in\r\n    prevention.\r\n\r\n    AN AMERICAN POLICY\r\n\r\n    worthy of us is not secrecy, but boldness--sacrifice\r\n    commensurate with exposure. This will lead to the formulation\r\n    of a bill by the Washington Convention, which Congress will\r\n    enact in the interest of individuals, the State, and for the\r\n    National protection. If State-Rights theorists bring\r\n    objections, the law may be so equitable to the States that\r\n    its ratification may be asked on the ground of a just\r\n    National policy and a right which inheres to the General\r\n    Government under the Constitution in the regulation of\r\n    commerce between the States. This implies a power to destroy\r\n    a contagious disease which if allowed to spread would arrest\r\n    all commerce in bovines between the States. A State may and\r\n    ought to waive the question of damage if it is fixed by a\r\n    neutral Commissioner, and the General Government and not the\r\n    State meets the losses to which unfortunate cattle owners\r\n    maybe subject. This will be the touchstone--trust by the\r\n    State and statesmanlike generosity by the Nation--that means\r\n    courage for the now fearful ranchman of the unfenced domain,\r\n    and the furnishing of a \"clean bill of health\" for our\r\n    products seeking a foreign market. Having evinced zeal in\r\n    doing justice, it can ask for justice--that the rights of our\r\n    meat-producers be respected under our\r\n\r\n    COMMERCIAL TREATIES.\r\n\r\n    Commerce means a mutual exchange, and having performed our\r\n    home duty will be in no mood to tolerate a whim or a caprice.\r\n    Non-intercourse has been proposed in Congress. That may be a\r\n    final resort when a conference, practical discussion, and\r\n    even arbitration have failed. A graver subject measured by\r\n    dollars may yet engage the statesman diplomat than the Geneva\r\n    arbitration, and we shall have no fair status in discussion\r\n    or arbitration until our meat and cattle are made healthy by\r\n    prevention and the best sanitary laws known to civilized\r\n    countries.\r\n\r\n    THE TIME IS AUSPICIOUS.\r\n\r\n    Cattle-raising as an attractive and profitable vocation is\r\n    now exciting a deep interest. A lull in politics forbids the\r\n    wants of our agriculturists, numbering 60 per cent of the\r\n    population, being waived out of notice and their voiced\r\n    demands drowned by partisan clamor. The treasury has hundreds\r\n    of millions in its vaults and a fraction of 1 per cent of our\r\n    surplus will only be required, under a just disbursement, to\r\n    isolate and destroy the diseases which fetter our commerce\r\n    and repress home enterprise.\r\n\r\n    A full and able convention at Washington is assured by the\r\n    responsive letters received. The State of Iowa will make her\r\n    requests to Congress by fine-stock meeting and other\r\n    associations, as becomes the State with $100,000,000 invested\r\n    in domestic animals.\r\n\r\n    Who can be indifferent in the face of our great perils, and\r\n    recounting the losses by foreign restrictions and inhibition?\r\n    We are emphatically a Nation of beef-eaters, and by the\r\n    extent of our domain and healthful climate are justly\r\n    entitled to the honored designation of the first producer\r\n    among civilized nations.\r\n\r\n    It is the question of healthful food for the masses, of\r\n    profitable tonnage for the railways, and of deep concern in\r\n    cultivating fraternal relations abroad, not less than a\r\n    question for the political economist in maintaining a good\r\n    trade balance-sheet. If we can impress our Congressional\r\n    delegations with the necessity of early and decisive\r\n    legislation, we shall have accomplished a noble work and have\r\n    earned the warm commendation of millions of citizens whose\r\n    interests have been neglected and whose vocation and property\r\n    have been imperiled.\r\n\r\n    For the committee by request of the Chicago Convention.\r\n\r\n    J.B.

In Illinois the average price received was\r\n$222.23; in Kentucky, $271.01, and in other States, $149.73. Of the beef\r\nbreeds there were sold $4,018, the total receipts were $1,015,772,\r\nmaking the general average $253.80. Of the dairy breeds 1,979 were sold\r\nat an average of $400.10.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the average for Short-horns is less than that for\r\neither of the other breeds though, of course, the number sold is greatly\r\nin excess of the others. In 1882 the average for Short-horns was but\r\n$192.10, and in 1881 but $158, so that on the whole the breeders are\r\nperfectly satisfied with the way the business is running.\r\n\r\nThe dairy breeds did remarkably well in 1883, the Holsteins coming up\r\nwell to the Jerseys, but the latter leads greatly in point of numbers.\r\n\r\nThe pure bred cattle business of the country as indicated by these sales\r\nis exceedingly prosperous.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain the Short-horn sales were less numerous than last year,\r\nor, in fact, any year since 1869, but the average was better than since\r\n1879. In 1880 the average for 1,738 head was $225, while in 1881 and\r\n1882 the average further declined to $175. In 1883 the average was close\r\nupon $230, but, upon the other hand, the number of animals sold fell to\r\n1,400. The highest price paid was 1,505 guineas, for a four-year-old cow\r\nof the fashionable Duchess blood, which was purchased by the earl of\r\nBective at the sale of Mr. Holford's herd in Dorsetshire. The\r\nAustralians purchased largely at the Duke of Devonshire's annual sale in\r\n1878, and this year American and Canadian buyers bid briskly for animals\r\nof the Oxford blood. These were the only two sales at which the average\r\nreached three figures, the next best being that of a selection from Mr.\r\nGreen's herd in Essex, when forty-one lots averaged $360 each, or less\r\nthan half secured by the Duke of Devonshire's Short-horns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCKING HORSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn English veterinary society has lately been discussing the question of\r\ndocking the tails of horses. The President looked upon docking as an act\r\nof cruelty. By docking, the number of accidents from the horse holding\r\nthe rein under the tail was greatly increased, for the horse has less\r\npower of free motion over the tail. If a short dock is put over the\r\nrein, the animal has so little control of the tail that he can not\r\nreadily liberate the rein. The \"stump\" is sensitive, the same as the\r\nremaining part of an amputated finger. In the majority of cases he\r\nconsidered docking entirely unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, Doctor Axe (rather a suggestive name for an advocate of\r\ndocking) thought the practice improved the looks of a horse, thus\r\nrendering it more salable. His sentimentality did not allow him to argue\r\nthis question of increased value. He did not think docking increased\r\naccidents. Statistics, not assertions, were needed to establish facts of\r\nthis kind. As to the remark of the President, that the shortened tail\r\ncould not be so easily freed from the rein, he said it would depend on\r\nwho was driving; an expert would more quickly disengage the rein from a\r\ndocked tail. It may be true, he said, that there was more flexibility in\r\nan uncut tail because its more flexible portion had not been removed;\r\nbut the docked tail had not the same power of covering and fixing down\r\nthe rein that the long tail possessed. The long retention of a certain\r\ndegree of sensibility after amputation was a known fact, but neither\r\nthis, nor the operation itself, involved much pain. He detailed the\r\nstructures divided, and said that they possessed a low degree of\r\nsensation.

In addition to the ordinary\r\ncircumstances attaching to business enterprise, the creamery business is\r\nessentially and peculiarly co-operative. It thrives with the thrift of\r\nall concerned--owner and patrons. It fails only with loss to all. The\r\nconditions of success, therefore, to the patrons are included in the\r\nconditions of success to the creamery, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThe object of this paper is to suggest some of these conditions and some\r\nof the instances of violation of them.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to discuss the case in which peculiarity of soil\r\nor climate, the greater profitableness of some other kind of industry,\r\nor other reason, would so restrict the size and number of dairy herds as\r\nto make the locality a barren dairy region. Notwithstanding the splendid\r\nachievements of the dairy industry it is safe to say that it may not be\r\nprofitable in any and every locality. Given the soil, the climate, the\r\nwater, the people intelligent and disposed toward the exacting duties of\r\nthis business, there are still many questions to be considered and many\r\nmistakes to be avoided.\r\n\r\nIt has been a pet idea in this country that competition is the\r\ncorrective of all industrial evils. Competition without doubt holds an\r\nimportant place among the industrial forces, but may be carried so far\r\nas to defeat the very objects it is adapted to subserve, when\r\nintelligently encouraged. Carried to the extent of employing two persons\r\nor more to do the work of one, of absorbing capital without the full\r\nemployment of it, it becomes destructive and expensive. We find, for\r\ninstance, in many towns, a large number of commercial establishments\r\ndoing business at an immense profit on single transactions, but the\r\ntransactions are so few and so divided up among struggling competitors,\r\nthat neither secures a profitable, nor even a respectable, business.\r\nWith choice cuts of meat from twelve to eighteen cents a pound and\r\nbutcher's stock at three and four cents, we often see butcher shops\r\nmultiply, but the price of meat usually remains the same. Indeed, the\r\nvery increase of middle man establishments beyond the employment of\r\nthese to their full capacity, and the consequent full utilization of the\r\ncapital and labor employed, is a sure loss to somebody, and if it does\r\nnot all go to the producer it is almost always shared by him.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest burdens which the creamery business has to carry\r\nto-day is the excessive number of its creameries beyond legitimate\r\ndemands. The co-operative idea, so far as it enters into this business,\r\nimplies the most profitable use possible of the resources employed in it\r\nboth of patron and creamery owner, and a fair and equitable distribution\r\nof the profits. Said a large creamery owner to me recently, \"I find\r\nthe comparative value of my butter steadily decreasing from year to\r\nyear. I have the same territory, the same butter-makers, the same\r\npatrons, substantially, but my butter is not up in quality and price as\r\nit used to be. I ascribe it to the excessive competition prevailing in\r\nit, i.e., it is one of its results. I have lost my influence over\r\npatrons in securing the best quality of cream. If I make any criticism\r\nof their modes or practices they say to me, 'Mr. ----, if you do not\r\nwant my cream I will let the other creamery have it. Do just as you like\r\nabout it; take it or leave it.'\" But the loss of one or two cents a\r\npound on the net proceeds of a season means five or ten per cent of its\r\nvalue, or of the entire season's results enough difference to make any\r\ncommunity in a few years rich or poor, thrifty or unthrifty, according\r\nto the circumstances in the case.\r\n\r\nFurther: the idea of co-operation implies the doing of equal and exact\r\njustice to all included within the co-operative limits. This, an\r\nexcessive and unprincipled competition greatly interferes with. It can\r\nproperly be demanded by every fair and honest patron of a creamery that\r\nevery other patron should be as fair and honest as himself. Indeed, this\r\nis an essential part of the implied contract. But in the case of\r\nexcessive competition no restraints can be imposed and no penalties can\r\nbe made to follow attempts to violate the principles of equity, except\r\nthe possible inconvenience of changing from one creamery to another. The\r\nstraight and honorable patron is powerless; the owner of the creamery is\r\npowerless; and the co-operative element is rendered a nullity.\r\n\r\nFurther: the co-operative element, in the relations of creamery and\r\npatrons, requires that the price of milk or cream shall vary with the\r\nmarket price of the finished product. Contracts for the future are mere\r\nspeculation, as a rule. If the transaction is large and the turn of the\r\nmarket unfavorable to the creamery, ruin is liable to come to the\r\nbusiness, and loss and disaster follow to all concerned. If the turn of\r\nthe market should be the other way, among the numerous patrons there is\r\nsure to be more or less dissatisfaction and a more or less breaking up\r\nof the condition of friendly reciprocity which should exist between\r\ncreamery and patron. Patrons may damage their own interest by exacting\r\ntoo much from the creamery as well as by accepting too little, and a\r\ngreedy grasping after an unreasonable share of the profit on the part of\r\nthe creamery owner is sure to bring retaliation, disturb cordiality of\r\nfeeling, and bring loss to all concerned.\r\n\r\nThe remedy for most of these evils can only come from intelligent and\r\nwise action on the part of the creamery patrons of a given locality.\r\nThey should study to prevent an unseemly and expensive competition.\r\nThey, as the encouraging source, will surely in the end pay the expense\r\nof it. It has been said that no people in the world enjoy paying taxes\r\nlike Americans, provided they are only indirect, sugar coated, and with\r\nsome plausible pretense. It would seem, however, that even American\r\ndairymen could see that the maintenance of superfluous creameries,\r\nsuperfluous teams for hauling cream and milk, superfluous men for\r\nmanufacturing and handling the product is an extra expense of which they\r\nwill surely bear their full share; if not at once, they will do so\r\nbefore the outcome is reached.\r\n\r\nAnother thing the patrons of creameries may properly take note of is\r\nthat the expense of manufacturing butter in all well regulated\r\ncreameries is nearly the same, and the value of the product does not\r\nwidely differ. When a creamery therefore claims large and peculiar\r\nadvantages, and offers a price for milk or cream markedly above the\r\nordinary price paid for it by other creameries, you may be sure there is\r\nsomething illegitimate about it. It may be done to drum up business, to\r\nbeat a rival, or it may be a downright swindle, it surely will not be\r\nlasting, and the operator intends at some time to recoup for himself.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that the dairy business is not one which can be\r\ntaken up and laid down hastily without greater or less inconvenience,\r\nexpense, and loss. Like most other branches of agriculture, it must be\r\nengaged in with the purpose of a steady, long, strong pull in order to\r\nbe a success. It has the advantage of springing directly from the earth\r\nwithout fictitious help, props, or governmental protection, so-called.\r\nIt taxes no other industry for its own benefit, and has expanded to its\r\npresent magnificent proportions in spite of the burdens laid upon it\r\nfrom outside sources.\r\n\r\nBut it is written \"And Satan came also.\" Nothing could more aptly\r\ndescribe the full influence of adulteration which has come upon this\r\nindustry. It has come clothed in deceit and fraud, the very habiliments\r\nof the devil. It can be exterminated no more than sin itself. It must be\r\nfought by exposing its nature; by stamping upon it its own features.\r\nWise legislation, I believe, will be in the direction of Government\r\ninspection and the sure and prompt punishment of fraud. The interest of\r\nthe creamery patron is more deeply involved in this matter than that of\r\nany other class, just as in other branches of production the perils and\r\nlosses by fraud, deterioration, and adulteration ultimately fall back\r\nupon the producer of the raw product. The apathy now existing among the\r\nproducers of milk and cream is ominous of evil, and discouraging to\r\nthose who are working in the interest of unadulterated goods. We have no\r\ndoubt that the time will come when not only the adulteration of butter,\r\nbut the adulteration of other food products as well, will only be\r\ncarried on under the stamp and inspection of Government supervision.\r\n\r\nThe thoughts I have presented are intended to be suggestive rather than\r\ndogmatic, and I leave the subject with the hope that the intelligence of\r\nthe average dairyman may be as active in tracing and comprehending the\r\nsubtler principles of trade and commerce relating to the products of his\r\nlabor as he is in comprehending the more immediate facts of his calling,\r\nsuch as breeding, seeding, and the handling of the raw products of his\r\nherd.\r\n\r\n[A] Paper read before the Illinois Dairymen's Convention by C.C. Buell,\r\nof Rock Falls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETERINARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany kinds of horse fevers have been described by antiquated veterinary\r\nwriters; but most exist only in the imagination of the writers, or have\r\nbeen manufactured out of the mistaken analysis of human fevers. All the\r\nreal fevers of the horse may be comprised in two,--the idiopathic, pure\r\nor simple fever, constituting of itself an entire disease, and the\r\nsymptomatic fever, occasioned by inflammatory action in some particular\r\npart of the body, and constituting rather the attendant of a disease\r\nthan the disease itself.\r\n\r\nThough idiopathic fever is comparatively infrequent in occurrence, it\r\nunquestionably meets the attention of most persons who have extensive\r\nstable management of horses, and its general tendency to degenerate into\r\nlocal inflammation and symptomatic fever, seems to arise far less from\r\nits own nature than from foul air, vicissitudes of temperature, and\r\ngeneral bad management. If idiopathic fever is not easily reduced, the\r\nblood accumulates in the lungs, the viscera, or some other internal part\r\nof the body, and provokes inflammation; or, if a horse, while suffering\r\nunder this fever, be kept in a foul or ill-ventilated stable, or be\r\nexposed to alternations of heat and cold, he speedily becomes locally\r\ninflamed from the action of the filth or exposure. The symptoms of\r\nidiopathic fever are shivering, loss of appetite, dejected appearance,\r\nquick pulse, hot mouth, and some degree of debility; generally, also,\r\ncostiveness and scantiness of urine; sometimes, likewise, quickness of\r\nbreathing, and such pains of the bowels as accompany colic. Idiopathic\r\nfever, if it does not pass into inflammation, never kills, but is\r\ngenerally always curable.\r\n\r\nCattle are subject to both idiopathic and symptomatic fever, very nearly\r\nin the same manner as the horse, and require, when suffering them, to be\r\nvery similarly treated. The idiopathic fever of cattle has, in many\r\ninstances, an intermitting character, which may easily be subdued by\r\nmeans of ordinary care; and, in other instances, has a steady and\r\nunintermitting character, and is exceedingly liable to resolve itself\r\ninto pleurisy, enteritis, or some other inflammatory disease. The\r\nsymptomatic fever of cattle is strictly parallel to the symptomatic\r\nfever of horses, and is determined by the particular seat and nature of\r\nthe exciting inflammation. But besides these fevers, cattle are subject\r\nto two very destructive and quite distinct kinds of fever, both of an\r\nepizootic nature, the one of a virulent and the other of a chronic\r\ncharacter,--the former inflammatory and the latter typhoid. Numerous\r\nmodifications of these fevers, or particular phases of them, are more or\r\nless extensively known among our readers as black-leg, bloody murrain,\r\netc. The fever which in many instances follows parturition, particularly\r\nin the cow, is familiarly known as calving fever, or milk fever; and the\r\nordinary fevers of sheep, swine, dogs, upon the whole, follow the same\r\ngeneral law as the ordinary fevers of the horse, and are classifiable\r\ninto idiopathic and symptomatic.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYOUR NAME printed on 50 Cards ALL NEW designs of _Gold Floral.\r\nRemembrances, Sentiment, Hand Floral_, etc., with _Love, Friendship_,\r\nand _Holiday Mottoes_, 10c. 7 pks. and this elegant Ring, 50c., 15 pks.\r\n& Ring, $1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n12 NEW \"CONCEALED NAME\" Cards (name concealed with hand holding flowers\r\nwith mottoes) 20c. 7 pks. and this Ring for $1.

Captain\r\nMurray is a man of stalwart built, well-knit frame and cheery, genial\r\ndisposition. He has been a constant voyager for a quarter of a century,\r\nover half of that time having been in the trans-Atlantic service. In the\r\ncourse of the conversation over the well-spread table, the mystery of\r\nthe City of Boston was alluded to.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" remarked the Captain, \"I shall never forget the last night we saw\r\nthat ill-fated vessel. I was chief officer of the City of Antwerp. On\r\nthe day we sighted the City of Boston a furious southeast hurricane set\r\nin. Both vessels labored hard. The sea seemed determined to sweep away\r\nevery vestige of life. When day ended the gale did not abate, and\r\neverything was lashed for a night of unusual fury. Our good ship was\r\nturned to the south to avoid the possibility of icebergs. The City of\r\nBoston, however, undoubtedly went to the north. Her boats,\r\nlife-preservers and rafts were all securely lashed; and when she went\r\ndown, everything went with her, never to re-appear until the sea gives\r\nup its dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, in your opinion, Captain, was the cause of the loss of the City\r\nof Boston?\"\r\n\r\n\"The City of Limerick, in almost precisely the same latitude, a few days\r\nlater, found the sea full of floating ice; and I have no doubt the City\r\nof Boston collided with the ice, and sunk immediately.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Murray has been in command of the Alaska ever since she was put\r\nin commission and feels justly proud of his noble ship. She carries\r\nthousands of passengers every year, and has greatly popularized the\r\nWilliams & Guion line. Remarking upon the bronzed and healthy appearance\r\nof the Captain, the reporter said that sea life did not seem to be a\r\nvery great physical trial.\r\n\r\n\"No? But a person's appearance is not always a trustworthy indication of\r\nhis physical condition. For seven years I have been in many respects\r\nvery much out of sorts with myself. At certain times I was so lame that\r\nit was difficult for me to move around. I could scarcely straighten up.\r\nI did not know what the trouble was, and though I performed all my\r\nduties regularly and satisfactorily, yet I felt that I might some day be\r\novertaken with some serious prostrating disorder. These troubles\r\nincreased. I felt dull and then, again, shooting pains through my arms\r\nand limbs. Possibly the next day I would feel flushed and unaccountably\r\nuneasy and the day following chilly and despondent. This continued until\r\nlast December, when I was prostrated soon after leaving Queenstown, and\r\nfor the remainder of the voyage was a helpless, pitiful sufferer. In\r\nJanuary last, a friend who made that voyage with me, wrote me a letter\r\nurging me to try a new course of treatment. I gladly accepted his\r\ncounsel, and for the last seven months have given thorough and\r\nbusiness-like attention to the recovery of my natural health; and to-day\r\nI have the proud satisfaction of saying to you that the lame back, the\r\nstrange feeling, the sciatic rheumatism which have so long pursued me,\r\nhave entirely disappeared through the blood purifying influence of\r\nWarner's Safe Rheumatic Cure which entirely eradicated all rheumatic\r\npoison from my system. Indeed, to me, it seems that it has worked\r\nwonders, and I therefore most cordially commend it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have no trouble now in exposing yourself to the winds of the\r\nAtlantic?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the least. I am as sound as a bullet and I feel specially thankful\r\nover the fact because I believe rheumatic and kidney disease is in the\r\nblood of my family. I was dreadfully shocked on my last arrival in\r\nLiverpool to learn that my brother, who is a wealthy China tea merchant,\r\nhad suddenly died of Bright's disease of the kidneys, and consider\r\nmyself extremely fortunate in having taken my trouble in time and before\r\nany more serious effects were possible.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation drifted to other topics, and as the writer watched the\r\nface before him, so strong in all its outlines, and yet so genial, and\r\nthought of the innumerable exposures and hardships to which its owner\r\nhad been exposed, he instinctively wished all Rheumatic Cure which\r\nentirely eradicated who are suffering from the terrible rheumatic\r\ntroubles now so common might know of Captain Murray's experience and the\r\nmeans by which he had been restored. Pain is a common thing in this\r\nworld, but far too many endure it when they might just as well avoid it.\r\nIt is a false philosophy which teaches us to endure when we can just as\r\nreadily avoid. So thought the hearty captain of the Alaska, so thinks\r\nthe writer, and so should all others think who desire happiness and a\r\nlong life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE FARMER\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nYOUTH'S COMPANION\r\n\r\nONE YEAR, $3 FOR THE TWO.\r\n\r\nIt is not required that both papers be sent to one address, nor to the\r\nsame post-office.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Address PRAIRIE FARMER PUB.

Barnard and\r\nArthur Bryant, Jr. Mr. Barnard had found the orchards thrifty and\r\nhealthy. The yield of apples had not been large this season, but\r\norchardists generally felt encouraged in regard to the future of their\r\norchards. He had found the high clay soils preferable for the apple. Mr.\r\nBryant reported the apple crop small. Some orchards had borne good\r\ncrops, especially of the Ben Davis. In others, this variety had failed.\r\n\r\n\r\nORCHARD CULTURE.\r\n\r\nMr. W.T. Nelson, of the committee on orchard culture, recommended the\r\nplanting of orchards on high, sloping ground. In the rather low and\r\nlevel country in which he lived (Will county) orchard trees lasted but\r\nfifteen or twenty years. But few varieties seem to do well in any\r\nlocality. He would advise men about to set out orchards to ascertain\r\nwhat varieties do well in their particular locality, and then plant no\r\nothers. He would not prune young orchards. He recommended the tiling of\r\norchards.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGH OR LOW, LAND.\r\n\r\nMr. Nelson's report opened up the subject of high or low lands for\r\norchards. Mr. Robinson got more apples from trees on low lands than from\r\nelevated sites. Prof. Budd did not commit himself to either theory, but\r\nremarked that some varieties do best on low lands, while others\r\npreferred the higher situations. Parker Earle thought that this theory\r\nof low lands for our apple orchards was contrary to the past teachings\r\nof the society. In his opinion high grounds are preferable. The subject\r\nwas a complicated one for Prof. Burrill. He had seen many low ground\r\norchards that bore good crops this year. There are many modifications\r\nthat effect the crop. It is not merely the elevation of orchard sites.\r\nIt was his belief that high ground, all things considered, is the best.\r\nMr. Robinson was not enthusiastic about the tile drainage of orchards.\r\nOur trees need more water than they usually get. They do not suffer from\r\ntoo much water, but from dry summers and rolling land. Mr. Spalding, of\r\nSangamon county, had found his nursery trees poorest when planted on a\r\ndepressed surface. He tiled extensively. His subsoil was a clay loam.\r\nNine years ago he laid tile 3-1/2 feet deep and 30 feet apart. He did\r\nnot believe in manuring young trees. Too rapid growth is not wanted.\r\nTrees in Illinois grow as much in one year as they do in two years in\r\nthe State of New York, where they raise more fruit than we do. The most\r\nrapid growing trees are the tenderest. He does not force the growth of\r\nhis orchard trees. He is satisfied nurserymen have manured their young\r\nstock too much. The question of high or low land was not settled. It was\r\nhard for members to give up the old theory that high lands are best for\r\norchards in Illinois; but it may be set down as a fact that the matter,\r\nas first brought to public discussion through THE PRAIRIE\r\nFARMER by B.F. Johnson, Esq., of Champaign, is having wide\r\ndiscussion among our fruit men. It will result in close future\r\nobservation and closer scrutiny of past results. Without doubt this is\r\nthe leading new horticultural question of the day. It requires a careful\r\ncollection of facts and a broad generalization. The theories and\r\nteachings of the past are nothing if facts are opposed to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT GROWERS AND FRUIT SELLERS.\r\n\r\nMr. Ragan, of Indiana, read a suggestive paper upon the relation of the\r\nfruit-grower to the commission man and the transportation companies. The\r\npaper led to considerable discussion. Mr. Earle always sells his fruit\r\nthrough a commission house. Without the commission men market-fruit\r\ngrowers could not do business. He found no difficulty in getting\r\nhonorable men to do business with. When he got a good man he stuck to\r\nhim. The commission man is just as important a factor in the fruit\r\nbusiness as the grower or consumer. He believes in a liberal percentage\r\nfor commissions. Dealers can not do an honest business for nothing. He\r\nis willing to pay ten per cent to the man who sells his fruit to the\r\nbest possible advantage, and who makes prompt and honest returns. The\r\ncheap commission man is to be avoided. The proper handling of fruit by\r\nintelligent dealers at fair rates is what we want. He ships small fruits\r\nin full quart boxes. Uses new boxes every time. Wants no returned\r\ncrates. To get best returns we must have neat packages. Stained drawers,\r\nbaskets, old barrels, and the like do not help to sell fruit. He would\r\nadvise shipping black and red raspberries in pint boxes; blackberries\r\nand strawberries in quart boxes. He picks his berry plantations every\r\nday during the ripening season. Sundays not excepted. No man who is not\r\nprepared to work seven days in the week during the picking season, or\r\nwho can not get help to do the same, will succeed in the raising and\r\nmarketing of small fruits. He has this year paid two cents per quart for\r\npicking blackberries and strawberries, and the same for pints of\r\nraspberries. It requires from five to ten pickers to the acre. He likes\r\nwomen or grown-up girls to do this work. As to varieties he likes\r\nLongfellow and Sharpless. They ripen slowly and everyday picking is not\r\nso necessary. Mr. Pearson said the apple growers in his locality find\r\nthat judgment must be used in marketing apples. The Lord made little\r\napples and we must do the best we can with them. A neighbor had small\r\napples and the shippers grumbled at them. The neighbor would not stand\r\nthis and shipped his apples to Chicago and had them sold on their\r\nmerits. The result was satisfactory. An Iowa buyer came down there and\r\noffered 50 cents per bushel for apples without regard to size, etc., and\r\nhe got them and shipped them in boxes to Muscatine where they were made\r\ninto jelly, dried fruit, etc. We can have no cast iron rules in regard\r\nto marketing, but must be governed by circumstances. This year it was\r\nbetter for his people to sell as they come, without the trouble of hand\r\npicking, sorting, and careful packing. We must act like intelligent men\r\nin this business as in all others. Circumstances alter cases. Good\r\ncommon sense is a prime requisite. Mr. Miller agreed with Mr. Earle\r\nabout packages for marketing fruit. He uses white wood boxes from\r\nMichigan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMULCHING AND MANURING.\r\n\r\nMr. Earle was questioned about the use of castor bean pomace for\r\nstrawberries. He uses it mixed with wood ashes. It is capital on poor\r\nland. He likes unleached ashes in both strawberry and orchard culture.\r\nHe pays six cents per bushel for them. The castor bean pomace is good\r\nfor anything in the poor soils of Southern Illinois. He uses about half\r\na ton to the acre. Spreads with a Kemp spreader. Five hundred pounds per\r\nacre will show excellent results. Has tried a tablespoonful of the\r\nmixture to the strawberry plant when setting out. Has tried salt to kill\r\ngrubs in asparagus beds, but found it to kill the weeds and most of the\r\nasparagus, while the grubs seemed to enjoy the application. Did not find\r\nit of much value as a manure. Bone dust had shown no particular results.\r\nSuperphosphates acted much like the bean pomace. Does not think coal\r\nashes of much value. He uses the pomace as early in the spring as\r\npossible. Sometimes he plows it under and sometimes applies after the\r\nplants are set, and cultivates it in. One application answers for two\r\nyears' cropping. He fruits a strawberry plantation but two years, and he\r\nsometimes thinks one year sufficient. He does not agree with some of his\r\nneighbors that mulching has resulted unfavorably. Does not think the\r\nmulch has increased the noxious insects. Knows of a plantation not\r\nmulched at all, that suffered more than any other this year from the\r\ntarnished plant bug.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL DISTRICTS.\r\n\r\nMr. Vickroy reported for Central Illinois. In August of the present year\r\nhe visited the orchards in the vicinity of Champaign, among them the\r\nnoted Hall fruit farm, near Savoy. He found the orchards in fair\r\ncondition. Many were sheltered by belts of trees. He observed that in\r\nthe lower or bottom land he found in connection with drainage, the best\r\norchards and the healthiest trees, and that on the more rolling or\r\nhigher grounds the trees were not as hardy nor did not bear as well. His\r\nobservations led him to believe in the draining of orchards, although it\r\nwas opposed to his previous education and of the teachings he had\r\nreceived in this society. He regarded the experimental orchard which he\r\nvisited at Champaign a failure, for the very reason that it was on too\r\nhigh ground; that the trees were dying, and many were not bearing. There\r\nwere, however, some varieties that showed good fruit. In his visit\r\nreferred to, he found the following varieties of apples did well in this\r\nlatitude:\r\n\r\nFall Varieties--First, Snow; second, Standard; third, Maiden Blush;\r\nfourth, Colvert; fifth, Baker Sweet; sixth, Pound Sweet; seventh, Fall\r\nRomanite.\r\n\r\nWinter Varieties--First, Minkler; second, Rawles' Genet; third, Willow\r\nTwig; fourth, Little Romanite; fifth, English Russet; sixth, Ben Davis;\r\nseventh, Michael Henry Pippin; eighth, Jonathan; ninth, Gravenstein;\r\ntenth, Rome Beauty.\r\n\r\nIn varieties in pears he gave the Howell and the Bartlett. In grapes he\r\nrecommended the Martha in white grapes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAPES.\r\n\r\nMr. E.A. Riehl, of Alton, read a very exhaustive and complete report on\r\ngrapes and grape culture, including the so-called grape rot. The\r\nsuggested remedies were bagging and training vines up on elevated wires,\r\nso the sun and air could get freely to the fruit. This point was\r\ncombated by Dr. Shroeder. Grapes ripen best in the shade. Another\r\ngentleman suggested that with the wire system as suggested by Mr. Riehl,\r\nthe grapes are shaded by the foliage in all the hottest part of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTS.\r\n\r\nProf. Forbes gave a learned and scientific dissertation on contagious\r\ndiseases of insects, and a number of germinal diseases, and experimental\r\nand successful attempts to kill them. The Professor showed that nausea\r\nis contagious and may be transferred by diseased worms, and that\r\ntherefore the spread of disease in worms would considerably lessen the\r\ndanger to plants and fruits from their inroads. These facts, said the\r\nProfessor, give us reason to hope that we have discovered another means\r\nof defense from destructive insects.\r\n\r\nMr. Earle will try pyrethrum next season for the tarnished bug. Prof.\r\nBudd gave a brief sketch of latest methods of killing off noxious\r\ninsects as followed by J.N. Dixon, of the State of Iowa, one of the\r\ngreatest fruit farmers in that State or in the Northwest. He destroys\r\nthe insect by sprinkling the trees with water diluted with arsenic,\r\nusing one pound of white arsenic to 200 gallons of water. This has\r\nproven a great success and is not at all expensive. Some members\r\nobjected to the use of arsenic on account of its poisonous properties.\r\nLondon-purple or Paris-green were recommended by some. Some members did\r\nnot like to have hogs running in their orchards; others found them a\r\nbenefit if but few were permitted. They did a good work. If the orchard\r\nis overstocked with them they do harm. They root about the trees and rub\r\nagainst them. It is not an uncommon thing for them to kill the trees in\r\nthe course of a couple of years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT COMMITTEES.\r\n\r\nDr. Schroeder, member of the committee on pear culture, made no formal\r\nreport, but in brief remarks urged the general planting and raising of\r\nthe kind of fruit as being profitable and productive. Mr. Samuel\r\nEdwards, of Mendota, chairman of committee on currants, read a very\r\ninteresting report on currants and gooseberries, in which it appeared\r\nthat the cultivation of this fruit was neglected and was on the decline.\r\nDr. A.L. Small, of Kankakee, made a report on plums, in which he\r\nrecommended the general planting of this fruit, he making a specialty of\r\nplum trees, and regarded the plum as a fruit that was coming more in\r\ndemand and popular, and one that readily adapts itself to the many kinds\r\nof climates and soils.\r\n\r\nMr. Weir also read a paper on plums and plum culture. He recommended the\r\nChickasaw because it is hardy and not liable to have its blossoms\r\ninjured by a late spring, like many fruits. He named the Newman and Wild\r\nGoose among other so-called seedlings that were very good. He expressed\r\nthe opinion that there was but one distinct species of plum in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORICULTURE.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary J. Barnard, of Manteno, from the committee on floriculture,\r\nstrongly urged the cultivation of house-plants, not only as beautifiers,\r\nbut to give the most pleasant occupation to every lady of the family.\r\nShe referred to the earlier flowers of summer especially--the crocus,\r\nsnow-drop, lily of the valley, tulips. Next to these came the annuals;\r\nwith little trouble these could be had for months. The wild flowers of\r\nthe prairies were spoken of, and she suggested that we should obtain\r\nseed of the flowers and raise such as we wish. The paper was a good one\r\nand was well received. Mr. Baller, a florist of Bloomington, said that\r\nof late the demand for plants had fallen off. The reason given was that\r\nthere was an increased general knowledge among the people. At the\r\npresent, the chief demands are for hot-house, cut flowers, and\r\nmonthlies. The reason given for the falling off of the demand for plants\r\nwas the fact that plants were more easily raised since the introduction\r\nof base-burners. This, he thought, could be still further increased by\r\nhaving a double sash, and the building of bay windows on the south and\r\neast of the houses. He reported, however, that there was still a good\r\nmarket for hot-house flowers among the rich for decorating purposes,\r\nfunerals, etc.\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE FARMER will, from time to time, consider other\r\npapers and discussions at this meeting, for there was much more of\r\ninterest said and done than can be condensed into a simple running\r\nreport. We advise farmers to send one dollar to the Secretary and\r\nreceive therefor a copy of the Transactions when issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SHORT SERMON ON A LONG TEXT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe text will be found in Leviticus 16: 21-22-23; but whether its\r\napplication can be found is uncertain. Horticulturists are prone to find\r\nscape-goats to carry their sins of omission and commission; and they\r\nload these--a great burden--upon them, and send them off to be lost in\r\nthe wilderness. Providence is most usually chosen by them for this\r\npurpose. Most of their mistakes and failures--sins, let us call\r\nthem--are ascribed to Providence; and He is expected to carry the\r\nburden. But I strongly urge they remain our own after all.\r\n\r\nI am led to these conclusions by the fact that among the many failures\r\nin fruit culture there are some splendid successes; and that these\r\nsuccesses occur with those, as a rule, who are guiltless of these sins;\r\nand that just in proportion to the magnitude of the guilt is the success\r\ninsured. In other words--that almost invariably are our failures to be\r\nattributed to our own want of skill and our neglect--most generally the\r\nlatter. Here and there we note cases of marked success--of heavy crops\r\nand large returns for care and labor invested. These are mostly on a\r\nsmall scale; as for instance, one man produces from at the rate of 200\r\nto 300 bushels of strawberries per acre, on a few rods of ground.\r\nAnother, his neighbor, gets about as many quarts. The conditions of soil\r\nand climate are about the same. Now is Providence to be charged with\r\nthis disparity? Certainly not. The same care, the same intelligent\r\nmanagement, and the same amount of labor bestowed, would have produced\r\nas favorable results in the one case as in the other.\r\n\r\nAnd so, as to larger tracts. I hold that what my neighbor can do on a\r\ndozen square rods, he and I both ought to be equally able to do on five\r\nor ten, or twenty times as large a tract. But, you say, these large\r\nyields are the results of extraordinary care. True, they are; and that\r\nproves my theory--that extraordinary care will produce extraordinary\r\nresults. What one man can do once, he can do again and all the time; and\r\nwe all can do the same. Extraordinary care may be defined as the care\r\nnecessary to produce good results, and if that care were always applied\r\nit would cease to be extraordinary.\r\n\r\nI myself saw in my neighbor's field a crop of strawberries, on two rows,\r\nwhich at the safest and closest calculation I could make, yielded at the\r\nrate of over 300 bushels per acre. He had but the two rows; had given\r\nthem extraordinary care--had kept them clear of grass and weeds--and the\r\nground mellow--and had mulched them with forest leaves. Those two rows\r\nwere in a field of several acres in size. The same care in planting, in\r\ncultivating, in mulching, and the whole tract would have produced\r\ncorresponding results. That same year, my crop, on soil equally as good,\r\nreached a yield of less than one-fifth in amount. Why this difference?\r\nProvidence favored him and didn't favor me, I might say, if I felt\r\ndisposed to make a scape-goat of Providence for my misdeeds. But I do\r\nnot believe that Providence did anything of the sort. The fault was my\r\nown; and I have no right to attempt to shift the responsibility. And it\r\nwas not want of knowledge either. We, none of us, do as well as we know\r\nhow. Our failures are mostly the results of sheer neglect. Mistakes, we\r\nincline to call them. Let us call them sins, and repent of them; and not\r\nendeavor to do as Aaron did, pack them off into the wilderness. When we\r\nbring ourselves to thus correct our mistakes, our crops will be\r\nincreased threefold, and Providence will no longer be made a scape-goat\r\nfor us.\r\n\r\nT.G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strawberry was introduced into England from Flanders in 1530.\r\n\r\nGardeners in London, England, are always ready to buy toads. The regular\r\nmarket price for them ranges from $15 to $25 per hundred.\r\n\r\nSoap-suds are a valuable fertilizer for all forms of vegetation;\r\nespecially serviceable for small fruits, and in the fruit garden proper\r\nwill never be wasted.\r\n\r\nAn Italian claims to have discovered that by drenching the foliage of\r\ngrapevines with a solution of soda the filaments of the mildew fungus\r\nwill be shriveled, while the leaves will remain uninjured. A Wisconsin\r\nnurseryman, however, advises the use of flowers of sulphur, which he\r\nbelieves a good remedy, also, when applied to the vines and when added\r\nto the soil surrounding them.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the Germantown Telegraph says that he has found salt\r\na valuable remedy for rust on blackberry vines, and concludes: \"I have\r\napplied two or three handfuls on the surface of the ground, immediately\r\nover the roots, when the plants were badly rusted; in two or three weeks\r\nthe disease had disappeared, and the plants had made a good growth. I\r\nbelieve moderate applications of salt, sown broadcast over a blackberry\r\npatch, would be of great benefit as a fertilizer and health renewer.\"\r\n\r\nGardener's Monthly: In the discussions on forest culture, little is said\r\nof the willow, which forms a very interesting department. The white\r\nwillow, Salix Candida, is often used for coarse work. S. Vinnunatis and\r\nS. Russelliana, are the most commonly used in the Eastern United States,\r\nunder the name of Osier, or basket willow, and S. Forbyana, a variety of\r\nS. rubra, or the red willow is often used for fine work. In the Editor's\r\nrecent visit to the Northwest a number of fine species were noted which\r\nwould evidently be worth introducing for basket-making purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Germantown Telegraph says: \"To grow good crops of blackberries the\r\nsoil should be good and especially deep, for the roots run down\r\nwonderfully when possible for them to do so; and as the growing fruit\r\nrequires its greatest nourishment in the usually dry month of August, it\r\nis an advantage to have deep soil for the roots to draw a supply from. A\r\ndeep, sandy soil will generally grow the best crop of berries, while a\r\nclay soil tends to produce rust. Good cultivation, good soil, and a\r\njudicious use of manure make stout and vigorous canes, with a crop of\r\nberries in increased ratio.\"\r\n\r\nIndiana correspondent Orange County Farmer: I have had a good deal of\r\nexperience in propagating currants. I always plant my currant cuttings\r\nin the fall as soon as the leaves fall off. They will make durable roots\r\ntwo to four inches long the same fall, while the buds remain dormant.\r\nThey will make double the growth the next season if set in the fall, and\r\nthey should be set in ground that will not heave them out by the effects\r\nof frost and should be covered just before winter sets in with coarse\r\nlitter. Remove the covering early in the spring and examine the cuttings\r\nto see if any of them hove, and if so, press them down again. Should\r\nthey heave up an inch or more, if well pressed down, they will start and\r\nmake better growth than cuttings set in the spring. In either case,\r\nhowever, the cuttings should always be made in the fall.\r\n\r\nA Rural New Yorker correspondent gets down to the real art of grape\r\neating. Hear him tell how to manipulate the fruit: No! the man who holds\r\nthe grape between his thumb and dexter finger and squeezes or shoots the\r\npulp into his throat, does not know how to enjoy the fruit, and is not\r\nlikely to appreciate the good qualities of a fine grape. Let the berries\r\nfollow each other into the mouth in rapid succession until three or four\r\nare taken, while with each insertion the teeth are brought together upon\r\nthe seeds without breaking them. The acid of the pulp is thus freed to\r\nmingle with the saccharine juice next the skin, and a slight\r\nmanipulation by the tongue separates the seeds and skins from the\r\ndelicious winey juices; after this has tickled the palate, skins and\r\nseeds may be ejected together. Close to the skin lies a large part of\r\nthe good flavor of the grape.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of protecting trees from mice, R.W. Rogers, in Ohio\r\nFarmer says: \"As the season is near at hand when farmers will have to\r\nlook to the protection of their young fruit trees from ground mice, I\r\nsend you my method if you deem it worthy of publishing. It is as\r\nfollows: Take old tin fruit cans, put them on the fire until the parts\r\nthat are soldered have become heated, when they will come apart. Take\r\nthe body of the can and encircle it around the tree, letting the sides\r\nlap each other, and press firmly in the ground before it has become\r\nfrozen. The mice coming in contact with the tin will turn them in\r\nanother direction. It is far better than mounding up or tramping snow\r\nabout them. Most any farmer can gather up enough for a good sized\r\norchard, and make them pay compound interest, which otherwise would be a\r\nnuisance or pitched out of the back window.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORICULTURE.\r\n\r\nGleanings by an Old Florist.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL MANURES AND OTHER MATTERS.\r\n\r\nThe successful raisers of many kinds of flowers use, more or less, some\r\nkind of what might be called artificial stimulants other than the\r\nordinary manuring of the soil at the time the plant is set out, whether\r\nit be in pot culture or in the open benches. This is no new thing under\r\nthe sun; not a few who have been in the habit, and found great results,\r\nhave tried to keep a monopoly, and have been more or less close-mouthed\r\nin the matter. Perhaps one of the oldest forms of this feeding extra\r\nstimulants to their pets was in the form of liquid manure made from\r\nvarious materials, as horse, sheep, cow, and other manures. They are\r\nsometimes prepared with ever so much mystery in the matter of quantity,\r\ntime of preparation, quantity given, etc., all of which was supposed to\r\nhave its influence. Of one thing, however, there was certain, tangible\r\nevidence that many of these persons managed, if for exhibition, to carry\r\noff the best premiums; and if for the market were pretty sure to command\r\nthe best prices, and what is more, obtain the greater results\r\nfinancially.\r\n\r\nSoot, guano, ammonia, and in later years, material obtained from the\r\nimmense slaughter-houses, such as blood and other offal in a highly\r\nconcentrated form, find, perhaps, nowadays, more advocates; principally\r\nbecause the first-mentioned list contains articles that give off very\r\noffensive odors while being applied, so that the more fastidious are\r\nloath to use them. What may not be very offensive to the plodding\r\nflorist would be highly so to the more refined, or when the general\r\npublic comes more into contact with the crops while being so applied. In\r\nalmost all of the cases where the ingredients mentioned are used they\r\nare diluted with a large quantity of water, except in the case of the\r\ndroppings of the animals; the latter are often used by florists in the\r\nform of a very heavy mulch, depending upon the ordinary watering to\r\ncarry down to the roots such parts of the dressing as would dissolve in\r\nthe water, and thus give extra stimulant, and at a time when it would do\r\nthe most good, because, ordinarily, the more water necessary the greater\r\nthe growth going on, and vice versa, if plants are in a state of rest,\r\neither from a finished growth or from lowness of temperature, but little\r\nwater would be needed, and but little benefit from the mulch, except\r\nsuch as undoubtedly arises from the ammonia itself in the manure\r\npermeating the atmosphere, which again, however, would be the most\r\nactive when heavy watering was necessary, simply because of the high and\r\nhumid temperature.\r\n\r\nFor obvious reasons the votaries of window gardening will use those\r\ngiving off little or no unpleasant odors. Others again make the soil so\r\nrich in the first instance that much less of what may be called\r\nartificial manures are required during growth. But without some skill in\r\nthis matter it is not safe, for if much of the material is not\r\nthoroughly decayed (which, however, has then lost most of its volatile\r\ningredients) it is, in the common vernacular of the gardener, too rank\r\nto give good growth and results, whether it be in fruits, flowers, or\r\nfoliage. For example, in Henderson's horticulture he recommends, as the\r\nbest soil for potting, loam and hops. He says, \"Not the least simple of\r\nthese operations is the preparation of our potting soil. We have, we may\r\nsay, only one heap--a big one it is--but it contains only two\r\ningredients, rotted sods, from a loamy pasture, and rotted refuse hops\r\nfrom the breweries, in about the proportion of two of the sods to one of\r\nhop. One-year-old rotted manure, if the hops cannot be obtained.\" It is\r\nevident upon its face that so large a proportion as one-third of a fresh\r\nmanure or hops would be disastrous; but well rotted, and with care\r\notherwise in temperature and other desiderata, it would be a highly\r\nstimulating soil. This was in 1869. We well recollect the commotion the\r\nhop business caused in the horticultural world at the time, as Henderson\r\nrecommended it for plunging pots in, setting pots on mulching outdoors,\r\nand almost every purpose. And did he not grow the best of stuff and\r\nhimself practice what he preached. Spent hops in this city were eagerly\r\nsought after and used, apparently with great success, in almost every\r\nflorist's establishment as well as market garden. What before was a\r\nnuisance to the breweries was eagerly sought after; like most things,\r\nhowever, it had its day, and is now seldom seen again. We might,\r\nhowever, say that its decline undoubtedly arose from its unpleasant\r\nfeatures, as it drew myriads of insects in its train and often emitted a\r\nvery unpleasant odor. Its great value consists in that it is the seed of\r\nthe hop plant, all seeds contributing by far the greatest value in\r\nmanures.\r\n\r\nIn the green-house the object aimed at, is the greatest possible results\r\nfrom limited area. Of the atmosphere the gardener has almost absolute\r\ncontrol--no siroccos, biting frost, or destructive winds interfere. He\r\ncan beat nature all to pieces in growing plants faultless in shape and\r\nin quantity of flowers, but his soil is of limited extent for the roots\r\nto wander in. To counteract this, he can give in other forms just as\r\nmuch and no more nutrition as is necessary to effect his purpose, and\r\nhere comes in this artificial supply of manurial agents.\r\n\r\nMr. DeVrey, the successful superintendent of Lincoln Park, uses horn\r\nshavings. This is the cleanest and most pleasant material that we ever\r\nrecollect to have seen used for the purpose, it is the refuse in the\r\nfactories where the horns from the slaughterhouse are steamed and\r\nmanipulated into the numerous objects they are applied to, not the least\r\nbeing into knife and fork handles, and the like. It is in the form of\r\nthin shaving of half an inch to an inch in length, quite dry and light,\r\nentirely free from odor. He takes all they make, and this year has a ton\r\nof the material for which he pays at the rate of three cents per pound.\r\nThe method of using is simply to mix with the soil at the time of\r\npotting, giving it, to the common eye, as oil specked all through with a\r\nwhite flaky substance. Its effect is very visible in a clear, healthy\r\ngrowth, given off gradually, and as it is quite common where vast\r\nquantities of plants are required to be grown in small pots, when there\r\nappears to be a necessity of some new stimulant, it should be given by\r\nthe amateur in a larger pot. This is done by shaking nearly all the soil\r\nfrom the roots and re-potting again if possible in the same sized pots,\r\nthus doing away with all artificial watering, and yet having healthy,\r\nluxuriant growth all the time.\r\n\r\nA pound of the material, which is light, will be enough for a\r\nwheelbarrow of potting soil. After all, the question is not so much the\r\nexact material employed of a number of similar agents, as it is with the\r\nintelligence brought to bear so as to apply at the right time the right\r\nquantity, and under the best possible circumstances.\r\n\r\nEDGAR SANDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nAM I A SCOT, OR AM I NOT?\r\n\r\n  If I should bring a wagon o'er\r\n  From Scotland to Columbia's shore,\r\n  And by successive wear and tear\r\n  The wagon soon should need repair:\r\n  Thus, when the tires are worn through,\r\n  Columbia's iron doth renew;\r\n  Likewise the fellies, hubs, and spokes\r\n  Should be replaced by Western oaks;\r\n  In course of time down goes the bed,\r\n  But here's one like it in its stead.\r\n  So bit by bit, in seven years,\r\n  All things are changed in bed and gears,\r\n  And still it seems as though it ought\r\n  To be the one from Scotland brought;\r\n  But when I think the matter o'er,\r\n  It ne'er was on a foreign shore,\r\n  And all that came across the sea\r\n  Is only its identity.\r\n\r\n  I came, a Scotchman, understand,\r\n  By choice, to live in this free land,\r\n  Wherein I've dwelt, from day to day,\r\n  'Till sixteen years have passed away.\r\n  If physiology be true,\r\n  My body has been changing too;\r\n  And though at first it did seem strange,\r\n  Yet science doth confirm the change;\r\n  And since I have the truth been taught,\r\n  I wonder If I'm now a Scot?\r\n  Since all that came across the sea\r\n  Is only my identity.\r\n\r\n--_Wm. Taylor, in Scientific American._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE NORTHWEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. C.W. Butterfield contributes an article on the Primitive Northwest,\r\nto last number of the American Antiquarian. He says that early in the\r\nseventeenth century French settlements, few in number, were scattered\r\nalong the wooded shores of the river St. Lawrence in Canada. To the\r\nwestward, upon the Ottowa river, and the Georgian bay, were the homes of\r\nIndian nations with whom these settlers had commercial relations, and\r\namong some of whom were located Jesuit missionaries. In the year 1615,\r\nLake Huron was discovered. To it was given the name of the Fresh Sea\r\n(Mer Douce). But, as yet, no white man had set foot upon any portion of\r\nwhat now constitutes the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan,\r\nWisconsin, and Eastern Minnesota. And thereafter, for nearly a score of\r\nyears this whole region remained, so far as the visitation of white men\r\nwas concerned, an undiscovered country; and such it continued down to\r\nthe year 1684. However, previous to this date, something had been\r\nlearned by the French settlers upon the St. Lawrence, of this (to them)\r\nfar off land; but the information has been obtained wholly from the\r\nIndians. This knowledge was of necessity crude and, to a considerable\r\nextent, uncertain. Such of it as has been preserved is properly treated\r\nof under the following heads: First, as to what had been gleaned\r\nconcerning the physical aspects of the country; second, as to what had\r\nbeen brought to light relative to the various tribes inhabiting this\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1634, nothing had been learned of Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair,\r\nor Lake Michigan although it was understood there was some kind of a\r\nwater-way connecting the Fresh Sea (Lake Huron) with Ontario. A little\r\nknowledge had been gained of a great body of fresh water lying beyond\r\nthe \"Mer Douce,\" \"a grand lac,\" so called by the French--now known as\r\nLake Superior. The length of this superior lake with that of the Fresh\r\nSea (Lake Huron), the Indians declared was a journey of full thirty days\r\nin canoes. At the outlet of the great lake was what was described by the\r\nsavages, as a considerable rapid, to which the French gave the name of\r\n\"Sault de Gaston,\" the present Sault St. Marie, in the St. Mary's river,\r\nthe stream, which, it is well known, flows from Lake Superior into Lake\r\nHuron.\r\n\r\nAccounts also had been received from the Indians prior to the year last\r\nmentioned, of a lake of no great size, through which flowed a river\r\ndischarging its waters into the Fresh Sea (Lake Huron). These were\r\nreports of Lake Winnebago and Fox river, in what is now the State of\r\nWisconsin. As the French upon the St. Lawrence had no knowledge as yet\r\nof Lake Michigan, they imagined the location of this small lake, and its\r\nriver was beyond, and to the northwest of Lake Huron and that they\r\nemptied into it; Green Bay into the head of which Fox river really\r\nflows, being (like Lake Michigan) wholly unknown to them.\r\n\r\nIt had further been reported by the Indians before this date that there\r\nwas a mine of copper on an island in what has been mentioned as probably\r\nLake Winnebago; doubtless, however, this island should have been located\r\nin Lake Superior. A specimen of native copper had as early as 1610, been\r\nexhibited by an Indian to an interested Frenchman upon the St. Lawrence,\r\nand an account given by him as to the rude method employed by the\r\nsavages in melting that metal. But other islands besides the one\r\ncontaining the copper mine had been brought to the knowledge of the\r\nFrench settlers. A large one southeast of the \"Sault de Gaston\" being\r\ndescribed, and two smaller ones, to the south of it. These islands were,\r\nit is suggested, the Great Manitoulin, Drummond, and Little Manitoulin,\r\nof the present day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Leeds has said that spices were adulterated to a great extent, but\r\nonly such substances were added as were purely non-poisonous. Mustards\r\nwere never found to be pure. Vinegars were also highly adulterated.\r\nCompetent officers, who shall be specialists, should be appointed in\r\neach State to examine manufactured and natural foods to detect\r\nadulteration. So far these examinations have been made by college\r\nprofessors. The State Boards of Health should take the matter in hand\r\nand see that it has the proper attention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA French periodical, La Culture, gives the following simple method for\r\ntesting the purity of water.

If at the end of forty-eight hours the water\r\nbecomes turbid and milky there can be no doubt of its impurity, but if\r\nit remains limpid it may be considered safely drinkable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE FARMER\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nYOUTH'S COMPANION\r\n\r\nONE YEAR, $3 FOR THE TWO\r\n\r\nIt is not required that both papers be sent to one address, nor to the\r\nsame post-office.\r\n\r\nAddress PRAIRIE FARMER PUB.

It has kept pace with the progress and\r\ndevelopment of the country, holding its steady course through all these\r\nforty-three years, encouraging, counseling, and educating its thousands\r\nof readers. It has labored earnestly in the interest of all who are\r\nengaged in the rural industries of the country, and that it has labored\r\nsuccessfully is abundantly shown by the prominence and prestige it has\r\nachieved, and the hold it has upon the agricultural classes.\r\n\r\nIts managers are conscious from comparison with other journals of its\r\nclass, and from the uniform testimony of its readers, that it is\r\nforemost among the farm and home papers of the country. It will not be\r\npermitted to lose this proud position; we shall spare no efforts to\r\nmaintain its usefulness and make it indispensable to farmers,\r\nstock-raisers, feeders, dairymen, horticulturalists, gardeners, and all\r\nothers engaged in rural pursuits. It will enter upon its forty-fourth\r\nyear under auspices, in every point of view, more encouraging than ever\r\nbefore in its history. Its mission has always been, and will continue to\r\nbe--\r\n\r\nTo discuss the most approved practices in all agricultural and\r\nhorticultural pursuits.\r\n\r\nTo set forth the merits of the best breeds of domestic animals, and to\r\nelucidate the principles of correct breeding and management.\r\n\r\nTo further the work of agricultural and horticultural organization.\r\n\r\nTo advocate industrial education in the correct sense of the term.\r\n\r\nTo lead the van in the great contest of the people against monopolies\r\nand the unjust encroachments of capital.\r\n\r\nTo discuss the events and questions of the day without fear or favor.\r\n\r\nTo provide information concerning the public domain, Western soil,\r\nclimate, water, railroads, schools, churches, and society.\r\n\r\nTo answer inquiries on all manner of subjects coming within its sphere.\r\n\r\nTo furnish the latest and most important industrial news at home and\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nTo give full and reliable crop, weather, and market reports.\r\n\r\nTo present the family with pure, choice, and interesting literature.\r\n\r\nTo amuse and instruct the young folks.\r\n\r\nTo gather and condense the general news of the day.\r\n\r\nTo be, in brief, an indispensable and unexceptionable farm and home\r\ncompanion for the people of the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe style and form of the paper are now exactly what they should be.

All\r\ninterested in the subject are invited to attend.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Iowa State Horticultural Society will hold its annual\r\nmeeting at Des Moines, January 15-18. Prof. J.L. Budd, Ames, will\r\nforward programmes on application. The usual reductions in railway and\r\nhotel fares are expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor S.R. Thompson, Superintendent of the Nebraska\r\nAgricultural College farm, has been chosen to represent Nebraska at the\r\nmeeting to be held at Washington, D.C., next week, for the purpose of\r\ntaking action in regard to contagious diseases of cattle. He requests\r\nstock men and all others interested in the cattle industries of his\r\nState to correspond with him, and make such suggestions as they may\r\nthink proper for guidance at the meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince its organization in 1853 to 1882 inclusive, the managers\r\nof the Illinois State Fair have offered the following amounts in\r\npremiums for live stock: Cattle, $70,406; horses and mules, $81,825;\r\nsheep, $24,450; swine, $25,320; poultry, $8,214;--total $210,215, which\r\nmust be considered pretty substantial encouragement. The total offered\r\nin premiums for all classes of exhibits has been $303,961. Thus a little\r\nmore than two thirds of the entire amount has been given to the breeders\r\nand importers of stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Northwestern Dairymen's Association say\r\nthat every indication warrants the conclusion that the coming convention\r\nat Mankato, Minn., commencing February 12, will prove the grandest\r\nsuccess in the history of the association. A full array of the best\r\ndairy talent of the entire Northwest will be present. The purpose is\r\nboth in the arrangement of the programme and in the conduct of the\r\ndiscussions, to make of the coming convention an institute for study and\r\ninstruction which no intelligent and progressive farmer can afford to\r\nmiss.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Missouri State Board of Agriculture asks the aid of one\r\ncompetent man in every township in the State to give it estimates of\r\ncrops, etc., in his vicinity. The aim is to give as full and reliable\r\nstatistics for crop reports as it is possible to collect. The State\r\nprovides but $1,250 for the general expenses of the Board, and it is\r\nthus dependent upon voluntary aid in the matter. The Board will defray\r\nall expenses of postage and stationery. Competent persons willing to\r\nundertake this work for the public good should address J.W. Sanborn,\r\nSecretary, Columbus, Mo. Such persons will receive, free, the monthly\r\nand annual reports of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn March of last year Secretary Fisher, of the Illinois State\r\nBoard of Agriculture, submitted his report for 1882 to Gov. Hamilton.\r\nThis report has just made its appearance. It has taken the State printer\r\nten months to get the volume printed and bound for distribution, a work\r\nthat any respectable job office in Chicago would have turned out in four\r\nweeks without any extra exertion. The report is valuable, of course, but\r\nit would have been worth a deal more had it appeared last April. Such\r\npapers as the report of Prof. Forbes, State Entomologist, for instance,\r\nmight have been of immense benefit to the people of the State if the\r\ninformation it contains regarding noxious insects had reached them in\r\nearly spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED SAMPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have letters from several parties desiring us to publish an offer\r\nthey make to send packages of seed corn and other seeds to any one\r\napplying and inclosing stamps to pay for trouble and postage. Some of\r\nthese parties also send samples of the seed. There is one great\r\ndifficulty in the way of publishing this class of communications. Once\r\nwe begin, the door is open to the practice of petty frauds upon our\r\nreaders which we have no right to encourage or allow. Now we are almost\r\ncertain that all these writers, thus far, are honorable men, who wish to\r\nconfer a favor upon their brother farmers, and who do not wish to gain a\r\nfarthing in the transaction. But some of them are personally unknown to\r\nus, and we do not feel like vouching for their responsibility, still\r\nless so because it is difficult to tell who will next propose a similar\r\nscheme. There is to be a brisk trade in seed corn during the next four\r\nmonths, and parties having a well tested article will find no difficulty\r\nin disposing of it at good prices, providing they can convince people\r\nthey have exactly what they claim. The way to do is to advertise the\r\nseed corn in the regular way, giving as references such men as the\r\npostmaster, justice of the peace, banker, etc., as may be most\r\nconvincing and convenient. We are as anxious as any one can be to see\r\nthe people supplied with well ripened and well cared-for corn grown in\r\nthe proper latitude, and we are equally anxious to guard them against\r\nimposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PORK QUESTION IN EUROPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of admitting American pork into France is not yet settled.\r\nThe Corps Legislatif is again \"all tore up\" by rash statements made by\r\nmember M. Paul Bert, who has published a letter at Paris in which he\r\nargues that the use of our pork must result in disease, and that a\r\ngeneral outbreak may be feared at any moment, so long as the products of\r\ndiseased swine are offered in French markets. He endeavors to strengthen\r\nhis position by pretending to quote from Dr. Detmers, Department of\r\nAgriculture Inspector at the Chicago Stock Yards. He alleges that\r\nDetmers has reported that diseased and dying hogs are sold daily in\r\nChicago, and then shipped as pork, bacon, and lard to Havre and\r\nBordeaux. To this audacious or mendacious charge Dr. Detmers replies as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    The statement made by M. Paul Bert, as contained in a cable\r\n    dispatch from Paris, is not only a perversion of facts, but a\r\n    falsehood cut from whole cloth. I never certified, wrote, or\r\n    said that dead hogs are shipped to packing-houses, or that\r\n    these carcasses are shipped abroad. All I ever said in regard\r\n    to transportation of diseased or dead hogs is contained in my\r\n    official reports to the Commissioner of Agriculture,\r\n    Washington, and can be found in his annual reports of 1878\r\n    and 1879, on pages 355 and 418 respectively, where it is\r\n    accessible to everyone. I simply called attention to the\r\n    transportation of diseased and dead hogs to the rendering\r\n    tanks--entirely distinct from packing houses--as affording a\r\n    means of spreading the then prevailing disease--swine plague,\r\n    or so-called hog cholera.\r\n\r\n    M. Paul Bert seems to be a true demagogue, otherwise he would\r\n    not resort to a falsehood to please his constituents. I never\r\n    in any manner, directly or indirectly, stated or intimated\r\n    that packers are or ever were in collusion with dealers in\r\n    diseased live stock. Moreover, the laws and regulations of\r\n    the Chicago Stock Yards are such as to render it absolutely\r\n    impossible that a dead hog should be smuggled into them, and\r\n    if an animal should die while in the yards it is at once\r\n    delivered to a soap-grease rendering establishment outside of\r\n    the Stock Yards, and can not possibly get into a\r\n    packing-house.\r\n\r\nThis reply came too late to have any effect upon French legislation, and\r\nthe decree of prohibition has been re-enacted. So far we notice no\r\nmarked effect upon the prices of pork products in this country, but\r\nlater it must result in depression. We notice the leading papers of the\r\nUnited States are advocating the retaliatory measures proposed months\r\nago by THE PRAIRIE FARMER against European States interdicting\r\nthe importation of our meat products. We refer to the prohibition of\r\nFrench and German adulterated and poisonous wines and liquors, and dry\r\ngoods and silk goods colored with poisonous dyes. It must come to this\r\nat last if such totally unreasonable legislation against American\r\nproducts is to continue in those countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN, WHEAT, AND COTTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preliminary crop estimates by the Statistician of the Department of\r\nAgriculture have been completed. He says the average yield of corn per\r\nacre for 1883 was within a fraction of twenty-three bushels, which is 12\r\nper cent less than the average for a series of several years past. The\r\nquality is another thing.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless true, Mr. Dodge says, that the quality of the corn north\r\nof parallel forty is worse than for many years, increasing practically\r\nthe amount of shortage indicated by the number of bushels. As the whole\r\ncorn grown in 1883 in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Dakota, added\r\nto half that grown in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska, would\r\nmake 400,000,000 bushels only--a fourth of the whole crop--so that the\r\npossible depreciation of 40 per cent in all of it would be equivalent to\r\na 10 per cent reduction in the value of the entire crop. The Illinois\r\nDepartment agents make the quality 31 per cent less than the average in\r\nthis State. An effort will be made later, after the worst of the crop\r\nhas been fed, to ascertain the feeding value of the year's product. It\r\nis not proposed, however, to reduce the product to the equivalent of\r\nmerchantable corn, or \"sound\" corn, as no crop ever is free from\r\nimmaturity or imperfection. There always are some Northern fields caught\r\nby frost, some neglected acres, some choked with weeds or flooded by\r\nover-flows, and so on--corn, which is mainly \"nubbins.\" What is intended\r\nwithout reference to panic or exaggeration is to find out the exact\r\ntruth and then tell it. There is nothing gained, be it to farmers or\r\nconsumers, the Statistician adds, in suppressing truth on the one hand\r\nor exaggerating the losses on the other. One feature of corn-growing in\r\n1883 should prove a lesson to the farmers of the country; that is, the\r\ngeneral use of seed corn in the West, grown in lower latitudes. The\r\nplanting of Nebraska seed in Minnesota and Kansas seed in Illinois, has\r\ndemonstrated the folly of attempting to acclimatize the Southern maize\r\nin the more Northern districts. Much loss from frost would have been\r\navoided had the seed been carefully selected from the best corn grown in\r\nthe immediate neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe wheat crop is estimated, as before, slightly in excess of\r\n400,000,000 bushels.\r\n\r\nThe cotton product, as shown by the December returns, is about 6,000,000\r\nbales. There will be another investigation after the close of the cotton\r\nharvest and the shipment of a large portion of the crop, when precise\r\nresults will be approached more nearly than has been possible hitherto.\r\n\r\nThe Department evidently feels a little \"nettled\" over the criticisms\r\nthat have been made upon its estimates of the last two corn crops. Again\r\nwe must protest that the amount of harvested corn in the West will fall\r\nconsiderably below Mr. Dodge's figures. Whether or not the Department\r\nsees fit to \"reduce the product to the equivalent of merchantable corn\"\r\nsuch an estimate would be of interest, and when it gives the result of\r\nthe feeding quality of the corn, there will be something of a basis\r\nfurnished for such a calculation, especially as we shall have by that\r\ntime a pretty accurate account of the exported corn of the crop of 1883\r\nand the amount \"in sight,\" as the grain merchants say. It is true that\r\nthere is nothing gained to consumers by \"suppressing truth on the one\r\nhand or exaggerating losses on the other\" but there is something lost to\r\nconsumers by overestimating yields at about the time the harvest is\r\nready and when speculators can use Government estimates to force down\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nThe statistical machinery of the Department of Agriculture is far from\r\nperfect, but it is the best the Government has supplied it with, and it\r\nis not wise or fair to criticise its estimates too severely, based, as\r\nthey often must be, upon inadequate returns. The most that can be said\r\nis that the Department should be exceedingly careful not to err on the\r\nside that may result in injury to the producers, for, as we understand\r\nit, it was created solely to advance their interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICAGO IN 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompared with the other great cities of the Union, and even with\r\nprevious years in her own history, Chicago had a prosperous business\r\nyear in 1883. The total trade of the year foots up $1,050,000,000, which\r\nis a slight gain over that of 1882. The receipts of flour were 4,403,982\r\nbarrels; wheat, 20,312,065 bushels; corn, 74,459,948 bushels; oats,\r\n37,750,442 bushels; rye, 5,662,420; barley, 10,591,619. Of cattle there\r\nwere received 1,878,944 head; hogs, 5,640,625; sheep, 749,917; horses,\r\n15,255; dead hogs, 55,656. Of seeds, 122,582 tons; broom corn, 15,038\r\ntons; butter, 53,987 tons; hides, 34,404 tons; wool, 20,122 tons;\r\npotatoes, 13,000,000 bushels; coal, 4,042,356 tons; hay, 50,000 tons;\r\nlumber, 1,848,817,000 ft.; shingles, 1,154,149 M.; salt, 1,096,587\r\nbarrels; cheese 23,590 tons. The total value of farm products of all\r\nkinds is estimated at $402,000,000, which is $20,000,000 above the\r\nvaluation of that of 1882. The products of Chicago manufactures are\r\nvalued at $325,000,000. In 1881 the receipts of hogs amounted to\r\n6,474,844 head, and in 1882, 5,817,504 head. The wholesale mercantile\r\ntrade has fallen off somewhat, as it has all over the country, owing to\r\ndepression that seems to be universal. In manufactures the city is\r\nmaking wonderful development. In growth she is still unchecked and\r\nwithout a rival in the world among large cities and business centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRONG DRINK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe often see in the papers the amount in dollars and cents, that strong\r\ndrink costs the people of this country. Some one has been making out\r\nsimilar statistics for Great Britain, and finds that if the total house\r\nrent is added to the rent of farms in the three divisions of the Kingdom\r\nthe total is $30,000,000 less than is usually spent for drink. Add\r\ntogether the cost of the linen goods, cotton goods, coal, tea, coffee,\r\nsugar, milk, butter and cheese and the total is only $45,000,000 in\r\nexcess of the sum spent in drink. And this is only the direct cost. The\r\nindirect expense of drink--the crime and misery entailed, the cost of\r\nprisons and almshouses, criminal courts and trials, the loss from\r\nidleness, incapacity, blunders, sickness--towers above these figures in\r\ncolossal magnitude. Counting all these things it may be said of both\r\ncountries that strong drink costs more than sufficient to supply the\r\npersonal needs--food, clothing, and homes--of all the people. It is\r\nindeed a fearful showing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DE LONG, Artesia, Miss.--THE PRAIRIE FARMER has the reputation\r\nof knowing all about the prairies, north and south, and, therefore, I\r\nappeal to it to tell me whether the Japan persimmon will be likely to be\r\nhardy in this section, some portions of which is, as you probably know,\r\na prairie country?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--The Japan persimmon, Diospyros kaki, is, as we understand it,\r\nan evergreen of sub-tropical origin, and will not be likely to fruit\r\nsatisfactorily far north of the region of the orange. Like the fig, in\r\nyour latitude, it may stand what frosts you have and, like it, attain\r\nconsiderable growth, but you will seldom get a crop. We know\r\nenterprising nurserymen are telling us it will grow and fruit as far\r\nnorth as Washington; but we were told the same story about the\r\neucalyptus, which proved to be no more hardy than the orange. Our\r\nauthorities for these opinions may be regarded as first-class--no less\r\nthan LeBon Jardinier, who says it can not be grown and successfully\r\nfruited outside the region of the orange. Recently, at a horticultural\r\nexhibition at Nice, France, there was a fine show of the kakis\r\ncontributed by a gardener in the vicinity of Toulon, of which the\r\nofficial report gives this account: \"Among the newer exotics were the\r\nkakis, of Japan, grown at Toulon. The fruit is about the size of an\r\naverage apple, a bright, orange-red in color, and the tree is very\r\nproductive. The Japanese make a great account of it, both as a fruit,\r\nwhen ripe, and as a source for obtaining tannin, in its green state. It\r\nappears to accommodate itself remarkably well to the climate of\r\nProvence, and especially merits to be introduced into Algeria, where it\r\nwill even do better in all reasonable probability.\". In respect to the\r\nappearance of the fruit, it more nearly resembles in shape and size a\r\nbell pepper, than an apple, but the color is orange-red, as described.\r\nIt is pretty sure to cut a great figure among the fruit products of\r\nFlorida, where its successful cultivation will lend additional\r\nattractions to that already seductive State.\r\n\r\nMRS. SARAH Y. STAPLES, DALLAS, TEXAS.--I do not ask you for a remedy for\r\nthe roup, with which my fowls have been recently affected; but for a\r\ncourse of treatment to follow to prevent its return?\r\n\r\nANSWER--The roup may be brought upon healthy fowls if they are shut up\r\nin narrow and unventilated quarters at night, and of days turned out in\r\ncold or wet weather. And it will almost certainly follow if they are\r\nconfined under glass, as they sometimes are in winter, in abandoned\r\ngreen-houses. In the first place, see fowls have a dry and airy roosting\r\nplace, but where they will be out of a draft or cold currents. Feed once\r\ndaily in the morning, the following compounded rations. Raw onions one\r\npart, pork-cracklins one part, and bread or boiled potatoes one part,\r\nchopped tolerably fine, but do not wet the mixture before feeding. If\r\nyou can substitute a few bits of garlic for twice the measure of onions,\r\nit will be all the better for the health of the fowls, but they might\r\ntaint the taste of the eggs. If fowls are fed this mixture once daily,\r\nit don't matter much what the other food is, whether corn or small\r\ngrain, though for laying mill-screenings or shrunken wheat is best.\r\n\r\nASA GRAY, ROCKFORD, ILL.--I have seen it stated the daily rations of the\r\ncowboys of the Southwest, in certain sections and during some months,\r\nwas confined to raw beef, rock salt, and red peppers. How is it?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--We don't know. Will someone familiar with cowboys and their\r\nmanner of living report. However, all things considered, the ration is\r\nnot a bad one, for the reason that raw beef digests in half the time of\r\nbeef well cooked, and the large, sweet pepper of the Southwest deprived\r\nof its seeds is not near as hot in the mouth as it is commonly\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nR. ROOT, CLARKSVILLE, IOWA. 1. Does the basket willow have to be\r\ncultivated like a field crop? 2. Is there more than one kind, and if so\r\nwhich is best? 3. What kind of soil is best adapted to its cultivation?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--1. In some respects, yes; the land having to be given over to\r\nthem exclusively. In France the cuttings are planted from twelve to\r\nfifteen inches apart in order to obtain long and slender shoots. 2.\r\nThere are half a dozen cultivated in Europe, the best two being the\r\nSalix rubra or red Osier, and the Salix vitellina or yellow Osier. But a\r\nhardier variety, Salix viminalis, is commonly preferred in this country\r\nwhere the cultivation, though often undertaken, has never been very\r\nsuccessful, from the fact that American labor can not compete with the\r\nlabor of women and children in Europe. 3. In cool climates having a\r\nmoist atmosphere the Osier willow is successfully grown where ordinary\r\ncrops thrive, but in warmer and drier sections low and moist land must\r\nbe chosen. Indeed the whole tribe of willows love cool, moist\r\nsituations, and the richer the soil the stronger and quicker the growth.\r\nWe should be glad to hear from correspondents who cultivate, or who live\r\nwhere the Osier is grown and prepared for market, the details of the\r\nwhole industry.\r\n\r\nB.F.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAYSIDE NOTES.\r\n\r\nBY A MAN OF THE PRAIRIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know that I really ought to take any credit to myself for it,\r\nbut I hope I have done something toward increasing the number of farmer\r\ncorrespondents for the hale old PRAIRIE FARMER. I can't help\r\nnoticing, as I do with pleasure, that the number is increasing.\r\nFurthermore, the correspondents all write well, I mean, simply; they\r\nseem to have something to say, and say it in a manner that can be\r\nreadily understood. Their writings are instructive, too. Well, I hope\r\nthis writing fever, like most others, will prove highly contagious, and\r\nhave a run through the entire PRAIRIE FARMER family. I know\r\nfrom experience the malady is not a dangerous one. At least it don't do\r\nthe writers any harm; if the readers can stand what I say, I am\r\nsatisfied. The editor may boil down our communications, or chop them up\r\nand serve them in any style he chooses, so that he presents all the good\r\nwe mean to say, and we will be satisfied. Will we not,\r\nfellow-contributors?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRufus Blanchard, for many years a leading map publisher of Chicago, told\r\nme the other day, that in 1838 he was farming in Union county, Ohio.\r\nThat year he grew about 1,000 bushels of oats, some 250 bushels of\r\nwheat, and raised 100 hogs. He sold his oats for eleven cents per\r\nbushel, his wheat for twenty-five cents, and his hogs for one cent and a\r\nquarter per pound. He hauled his grain to Columbus, forty miles, to\r\nmarket, and took his pay in salt. I remarked that this was pretty rough\r\nfarming. \"On the contrary,\" said he, \"in those days we were happy as\r\nclams. We had all the pork we wanted without cost, for our hogs fattened\r\nthemselves on the mast of the woods. We paid by toll for grinding our\r\nwheat into flour. The woods supplied us with deer, turkeys, and many\r\nother kinds of game. Our clothing was homespun. We had plenty of corn\r\nmeal and cheaply grown vegetables, and helped each other in sickness or\r\naccident. If a neighbor's log house burned down, we all joined together\r\nin putting him up a better one than he had before. We had pretty good\r\nschools and interesting religious meetings without expensive pew rents\r\nor style in dress. We visited each other and had plenty of sound\r\namusement. I never was so happy or so well contented in my life,\" he\r\nadded, and I believe him, for his face is wrinkled with care and\r\nsaddened by misfortune. It don't do, you see, to get too far removed\r\nfrom this simple, natural life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am looking out for a little colder weather. The pond is not yet frozen\r\nsufficiently for us to cut ice as we want it. But both my neighbor and\r\nmyself have gotten all things in readiness for the harvest. I like an\r\nopen winter pretty well, but I do want ice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that Dr. Detmers is always going off \"half-cocked.\" He\r\nonce did the foreign cattle shipping interest great harm by an\r\nill-advised and unwarranted dispatch concerning the prevalence of\r\npleuro-pneumonia at the Chicago Stock Yards, and now I notice that his\r\nalleged statements regarding diseased hogs and the disposal of them at\r\nthe same point have furnished the French Corps Legislatif an excuse for\r\nenacting the decree prohibiting the introduction of American pork\r\nproducts into France. Isn't it about time the Department of Agriculture\r\nat Washington sat a little down on this man who writes too much with his\r\npen? Not that I would silence any man who sticks to facts, no matter\r\nwhose soap-bubble he pricks; but a simple alarmist who rushes into print\r\nmainly for the pleasure it gives him to see his name in print, and to\r\nknow that he is talked about, deserves to be squelched. For aught I\r\nknow, though, Dr. Detmers has been misrepresented by the wily Frenchmen.\r\nWhat has Dr. Loring to say on the subject?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut, after all, as I think the editor of THE PRAIRIE FARMER\r\nhimself said some months ago, this foreign agitation of the live stock\r\nquestion may result in great good, inasmuch as it must lead to proper\r\nlegislation in this country against the introduction and spread of\r\ncontagious diseases among animals. It is without doubt the basis of the\r\nproceedings at the Chicago cattle-growers' convention in November last,\r\nand of the present movement for immediate Congressional action upon the\r\nmatter. The difficulty abroad will, I believe, prove short-lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM CHAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of two days, the 22d and 23d, which were stormy and\r\ngave us ten to twelve inches of snow, followed by a little sleet and\r\nrain, the latter half of December has been as delightful as the first\r\nhalf was, though a good deal colder. The sleighing since the 17th has\r\nnever been better; and as there is ten inches to a foot of solid snow\r\nnow lying on the ground, it is likely to last some time longer. The\r\nsleet and rain formed a crust an inch and a half thick, and though it is\r\nnot very strong, it, together with the compact snow, makes getting down\r\nto the grass beneath quite out of the question, and stock have to depend\r\non the stalk fields or be fed hay and corn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis will make a heavier draft upon the grain and hay in reserve than\r\nhas been anticipated by those who depend on carrying their stock through\r\nmostly on grass, and be sure to lessen the surplus and raise the price\r\nof corn, oats, and hay accordingly. Corn in the field is drying out so\r\nfast under the influence of the dry, cold weather, stock do not refuse\r\nsoft corn as they did after the first sharp frost in November and\r\nDecember. It is now seen that it would have been better to have left all\r\nthe soft and some of the immature corn in the field, than to have husked\r\nand cribbed it as many did and lost more than would be believed, if\r\nreported, by mould and rot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt any rate the fall wheat is safe so long as the present covering of\r\nsnow lasts, and this more than compensates for the loss of winter\r\npasture. The snow, as near as I can learn, covers all Illinois, except a\r\nfew counties on the west, and as usual, is quite as heavy in the\r\ntimbered regions of which Vandalia is near the center, as in Northern\r\nIllinois. So far the cold season considerably resembles the winter of\r\n1878-79, and let us hope it will continue to the end, that we may have\r\nlight snows and many of them, good sleighing and moderate temperature\r\nthrough January and February.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has mystified me, as I have do doubt it has many others, why European\r\nGovernments have had so much to say about trichinæ in the hog, of which\r\nwe have had scarcely any, and so little of hog cholera, of which we have\r\nhad a good deal. But the mystery is now cleared up. The sickness and\r\nlosses from hog cholera, have either by error or intention been reported\r\nto the several European Governments as results of almost universal\r\ntrichiniasis, and they have acted accordingly. That it should be so,\r\nseems surprising, but that it is so, we have the proof in the following\r\nparagraph from a late number of the Journal D'Agriculteur Pratique. The\r\nwriter, Dr. Hector George, one of the regular contributors, in a long\r\narticle opposing rescinding the order prohibiting the importation of\r\nAmerican pork products into France, first quotes the report of the\r\nChicago Board of Health, that 8 per cent of hogs slaughtered in Chicago\r\nare afflicted with trichinæ, goes on to say: \"This per cent, however\r\nconsiderable it may be, is far inferior to the reality if we judge from\r\nan official dispatch addressed to Earl Granville by Mr. Crump, English\r\nConsul at Philadelphia.\" in 1880 trichiniasis destroyed 700,000 hogs in\r\nIllinois alone. According to an official report by Dr. Detmers to the\r\nGovernment of the United States, the hogs sick or dead from trichiniasis\r\nare hurried to the packing houses and are thereafter prepared and\r\nimmediately sent off to Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. Paul Bert, from whom we have recently heard on the same subject and\r\nin the same strain, no doubt got his inspiration from the article in the\r\nJournal D'Agriculteur Pratique after which he probably read the official\r\nreport of Dr. Detmers, to whom he refers, and like Dr. George, either\r\ndid not understand or intentionally misconstrued it for political\r\npurposes. Perhaps what Dr. Detmers did report was bad enough and\r\nextravagant enough, but it had exclusive reference to hog cholera then\r\nprevalent, as any one can satisfy himself who will turn to the reports\r\nor the Department of Agriculture for the several years 1879, 1880, and\r\n1881.

Write for Your Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAT WITH CORRESPONDENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that I have repeatedly said I would not answer\r\nquestions unless they came through THE PRAIRIE FARMER the\r\npeople who, by ways and means best known to themselves, have managed to\r\nobtain my address, keep right on asking questions by mail at a rate that\r\nwould drive me frantic if anything could. But nothing ever troubles me\r\nlong at a time, so I take your disregard of my wishes good naturedly, as\r\nI take everything else that I can't help, and in the future I will\r\nanswer all questions whether they come through THE PRAIRIE\r\nFARMER or not, sometime. To be sure \"sometime\" is not very\r\ndefinite, but it is the best I can do. My poultry letters are \"too\r\nnumerous to mention\" and it requires no small amount of time to answer\r\nthem all; but I won't growl about that if you will only be patient and\r\nnot grumble if you don't get an answer \"by return mail,\" or \"in the next\r\npaper.\" All questions of general interest will be answered in these\r\ncolumns as soon as possible, while those that require an immediate\r\nanswer will be attended to by mail. Poultry raisers who desire\r\ninformation that I can give, and who have not my address, can address\r\nTHE PRAIRIE FARMER. However, let me ask you not to write except\r\nwhen necessary, and then please put your questions as plainly as\r\npossible, and \"be as brief as the nature of the subject will permit.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when you are writing to me don't use postal cards. Postal cards are\r\nonly intended for the briefest of business messages, but lots of people\r\nuse them for nearly all their correspondence. I know one man who writes\r\nlove letters on postal cards. Most women and some men manage to make one\r\nside of a 5 × 3 inch postal card do duty for four pages of commercial\r\nnote. They will write up and down and across lots and on the bias until\r\nthe whole thing is so hopelessly mixed and tangled up that if the\r\nmystery of a woman's ways, or the fate of Charlie Ross were solved upon\r\none of these cards all the \"experts\" in the world could not unravel it.\r\nA penny saved may be as good as a penny earned, and I have no objections\r\nto your saving it in a legitimate way, but when it comes to saving it at\r\nthe expense of my time, patience, and eye-sight, I object most\r\ndecidedly. Hereafter I will not answer postals; I will not even read\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAn Iowa woman writes: \"If it is true that vaccination prevents chicken\r\ncholera, how does it happen that fowls which had the genuine chicken\r\ncholera last season took the disease again this season and died from the\r\neffects of it? This happened on our place.\" I have puzzled my brains on\r\nthe same thing but I am not scientific enough to explain things that I\r\ndon't know anything about, so I leave that conundrum to be answered by\r\nsome of the learned people who have the whole theory of chicken cholera\r\nat their tongues' end.\r\n\r\nSeveral correspondents want to know how to get rid of rats in\r\npoultry-houses. One man says that he firmly believes that there are more\r\nrats than chickens in his poultry-house, and although he has tried half\r\na dozen different kinds of rat-traps he rarely catches anything in them.\r\n\r\nI never found rat-traps much good; some of them would catch one or two,\r\nbut after that the rest of the tribe would fight shy of all such devices\r\nfor their undoing. A well trained rat terrier proved to be the best\r\nrat-trap we ever had on the premises, and for the poultry raiser who\r\nlikes dogs a good ratter would be a good investment. Or you can use some\r\none of the \"exterminators\" that may be obtained at the drug stores.\r\nRemove your fowls to some other building, prepare the poison according\r\nto directions, and place it in the poultry-house. The best kinds to use\r\nare those that make the rats thirsty and cause them to die immediately\r\nafter drinking; water can then be left in the hen house and the dead\r\nrats will be found close by. When you have rat poison in the house see\r\nthat it is properly marked and put out of reach of children and careless\r\nhired girls; and always see that all remnants of bait are taken care of.\r\n\r\nA Nebraska man wants to know why his hens don't lay. Says they are\r\nmostly early pullets, have a fairly comfortable poultry house, all the\r\ngrain they will eat twice a day, and plenty of fresh water at all times.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that \"all the grain they will eat twice a day\" is rather\r\noverdoing the grain business. Have some of that grain ground, mix with\r\nboiled vegetables and feed warm every morning; also give green food and\r\nraw bone, and my word for it your hens will soon \"lay like sixty.\"\r\n\r\nFANNY FIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEATHER ENDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlymouth Rock pullets are not always early layers, for they\r\noften grow for ten or twelve months before laying, though some say as\r\nearly as six months after being hatched. The best plan the keep Plymouth\r\nRocks is to get the pullets hatched as early as possible. April is as\r\nlate as should be desired, but a Plymouth Rock cock crossed on common\r\nhens will produce pullets that may be hatched later.\r\n\r\nN.Y. Times: A poultry-house should be large enough to be airy,\r\nbut if it is kept strictly clean and sweet it will do no harm to be\r\nsomewhat crowded. A house 24 feet long, 10 feet wide, 5 feet high behind\r\nand 8 feet in front, and having four roosting poles, all on a level and\r\nonly a foot from the floor, will hold 60 to 80 fowls. This manner of\r\narranging the roosts prevents a good deal of quarreling to get on the\r\ntop perch.\r\n\r\nPoultry-rearing for export appears to be largely on the increase in\r\nGermany; and Rummelsburg, near Berlin, boasts of the largest goose\r\nmarket probably in the world. There arrive daily at that station on an\r\naverage forty cars with geese and ducks. Every car contains about 1,500,\r\nthus making about 400,000 birds shipped every week, or an annual total\r\nof 20,000,000. The largest portion of these birds are reared and\r\nfattened in the surrounding provinces, and thence dispatched to all\r\nparts of Germany, England, Belgium, France, Switzerland, and other\r\nEuropean countries.\r\n\r\nFarmers' Call: Turkeys do not require as warm quarters in\r\nwinter as do other fowls. They will rest on a cherry tree when the\r\nmercury is frozen solid in the thermometer bulb, and then fly down in\r\nthe morning and wade through the snow to cool off. This is a hint to the\r\nturkey raiser. Do not confine the turkeys in quarters too warm and\r\nclose, and be sure that they have three or four hours' exercise each day\r\nin the open air. The turkey is really a hardy fowl and easily wintered\r\nif you do not pet it too much. Be a little unkind to it in cold weather.\r\nAbout all the shelter they will need is a wind-break. Give them plenty\r\nof highly nutritious food.\r\n\r\nMr. Harrison Weir writes: \"What the farmers should do is\r\nthis--they should produce their poultry of the finest quality, poultry\r\nof the stamp of the old Dorking--plump birds, thick-skinned birds,\r\nsmall-boned birds, and birds with little offal--fat them well, truss\r\nthem well, and send them to market. The white-legged beauties would take\r\nthe highest price, and, if well seen to, would very soon drive the\r\nforeign fowls from our markets, and English gold would gladden the home\r\nof the English henwife. I may mention that a neighboring farmer intends\r\nrearing 3,000 chickens next spring, all to be off his ground before the\r\nbeginning of May, when the cattle will come out. He expects to get 75c.\r\na head, and I believe he will, and it will pay him if he does.\"\r\n\r\nPoultry houses should be whitewashed inside and out. For the\r\ninside we add two tablespoonfuls of carbolic acid or a pound of sulphur\r\nto a pailful of the wash (to kill vermin); do not be afraid of putting\r\non too much, but apply the wash to every corner and crevice in the\r\nbuilding. If you have plank floors, clean them off nicely and put on\r\nthree or four inches of fresh earth. Dirt floors should be dug up the\r\ndepth of one foot. Wash your windows (if you have any in your house, and\r\nif not you ought to have them), so that the fowls can see daylight, and\r\nin bad weather they will enjoy the confinement of the poultry houses\r\nmuch better. Wash off the roosts with kerosene oil at least once a week.\r\nTake every nest box and wash inside and out, and put in clean straw,\r\nsprinkling upon it some sulphur or loose tobacco. Observe these rules,\r\nand your fowls will do better and keep healthier. We find this good\r\nadvice floating about and do not know its source. The hints are worth\r\nremembering.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE THROAT.--\"_Brown's Bronchial Troches_\" act directly on the organs\r\nof the voice.

The head of many a family is overcast\r\nwith gloom as he ascertains the true state of his affairs, and perceives\r\nhow little he has to show from the past year of toil. His family may\r\nhave been industrious in a general way, and yet been consumers only, and\r\nnot producers. We knew a farmer's family where there were three\r\ndaughters just budding into womanhood. On inquiring of the mother what\r\nshe had to sell to clothe her daughters with, she answered, Not a thing.\r\nHave you no butter, eggs, fowls, honey, or bees-wax to sell from this\r\ngood farm? No, nothing. These girls were not idle! Oh no. They pounded\r\nthe organ, and the result was music as sweet as filing a saw; crocheted,\r\ndarned lace, and helped mother. When their father went to town they\r\nasked him to bring them a pair of shoes, a bustle, or a necktie, with no\r\nthought or care. And all the while the neighbors said \"he was hard run.\"\r\n\r\nThere are few farmers' families that are so situated that they can not\r\ncare for a few colonies of bees. They not only need the sweets they\r\ngather, but these industrious insects help to fertilize the bloom of\r\ntheir orchards and meadows. Nature has appointed this insect, and it\r\nalone, to do this work for her.\r\n\r\nHoney can be used in many ways as a substitute for sugar--in canning\r\nfruit, making cookies, and for other culinary purposes.\r\n\r\nWe would advise all those contemplating bee-keeping to start on a small\r\nscale, if they have had no previous training. Two colonies are plenty,\r\nand then let their knowledge increase in the same ratio as do their\r\nbees. The next thing in order, after purchasing bees, should be a good\r\nstandard work on apiculture; and study it well. A person should be full\r\nof theory, and then they are ready for practice. Those who are\r\nenergetic, willing to work, intelligent and willing, eager to learn,\r\nobserving, persevering, and attentive to their work, will rarely ever\r\nfail in apiculture.\r\n\r\nWe have heard farmers say that bees will not flourish with the same care\r\ngiven to other farm stock, and that they have not time to attend to\r\nthem. We would recommend to all such to try the experiment of procuring\r\na colony or two of beautiful Italians, in some good movable frame hive,\r\nand present them to the family, with abundance of bee literature, and\r\nsee if they are not taken care of, especially if the almighty dollar\r\nputs in an appearance.\r\n\r\nMRS. L. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. Cook, at the late Michigan Convention of Bee-keepers, spoke in\r\nthis wise on the topic of the New Bees:\r\n\r\n\"I have had no experience with the Cyprian bees, but I think more and\r\nmore of the Syrian. I find no trouble to handle them, and take my large\r\nclass of students, new to the business, right into the apiary. These\r\nthirty or forty students daily manipulate the bees, doing everything\r\nthat the bee-keeper ever needs to do, and rarely ever get stung. I find\r\nthat the comb honey of the Syrians is excellent, that the bees go\r\nreadily into the sections. We did not get all our sections so that they\r\ncould be crated without the use of the separators; but I am not sure but\r\nthat it was more our fault than the fault of the bees. They are very\r\nprolific, breeding even when there is no nectar to gather, and they\r\noften gather when other bees are idle. I have this fall secured from Mr.\r\nFrank Benton a Carniolan queen, and shall try crossing the Carniolans\r\nwith the Syrians. Perhaps we can thus secure a strain with the\r\namiability of the Carniolan, and the business of the Syrians.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIVE AND HONEY HINTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Willingford, of Carlingford, Ontario, who had a crop of\r\nseveral tons of honey this year, has taken it to England for sale.\r\n\r\nManufacturers of tobacco, of pickles, of cakes and cookies,\r\nconfectioners, and pork-packers are now using honey more extensively\r\nthan ever in the preparation of their specialties.\r\n\r\nA singular instance of bee-swarming occurred a short time ago\r\nin Singapore harbor, on board the British steamer Antonio, which at the\r\ntime was lying entirely outside the shipping in the roads. A swarm of\r\nwild bees from the shore suddenly located themselves directly under the\r\nsternpost of a boat lying above the deck, and all attempts to drive them\r\naway proved unavailing, the chief officer being very severely stung in\r\nendeavoring to get rid of them. They held to their position for several\r\ndays, and were eventually destroyed after the steamer had hauled\r\nalongside the wharf.\r\n\r\nRev. L.L. Langstroth recently said: When I commenced\r\nbee-keeping, a sting caused much swelling, but in time this trouble\r\npassed away. Several years passed, during which I handled no bees, and\r\nwhen I again attempted it, I found myself more susceptible to the poison\r\nthan ever, but by continuing to work with the bees, disregarding the\r\nstings, my former indifference returned.\r\n\r\nOhio bee-keepers will discuss the following questions at the\r\nColumbus meeting on the 14-16: How to winter bees successfully. How many\r\nbrood-frames are necessary in one hive? What can be done to prevent\r\nadulteration of honey? How to create a home market for honey. How many\r\ncolonies can be kept in one locality? Can we do without separators? What\r\nshall we do with second swarms? Which is the most salable\r\nsection--one-half, one, or two pounds? Which are best--deep or shallow\r\nframes? Is it advisable to have a standard-size frame for all\r\nbee-keepers?\r\n\r\nMany are inquiring the proper way to let bees out on shares, so\r\nas to have both parties satisfied. I do not know any such way, for the\r\nmost I have known in regard to letting bees out on shares resulted in\r\nboth parties being dissatisfied. But it all depends on what the\r\nagreement is; and perhaps you had better have it down in writing. One\r\ncase I have recently heard of, the agreement was to divide the profits.\r\nWell, it so happened that there was no profit, but there was a pretty\r\nbig loss; and as no provision had been made for this state of affairs,\r\neach one felt disposed to put the loss on to the shoulders of the other.\r\nI decided it would be about fair to divide the loss; but very likely\r\ncircumstances might make this not the right way after all. So says the\r\neditor of Gleanings. It strikes us that he is all right, but if he had\r\nsaid to bee-keepers \"use the same common sense as to contracts that\r\npeople do in other kinds of business,\" he would have covered the whole\r\nground.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE FARMER\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nYOUTH'S COMPANION\r\n\r\nONE YEAR, $3 FOR THE TWO.\r\n\r\nIt is not required that both papers be sent to one address, nor to the\r\nsame post-office.\r\n\r\nAddress PRAIRIE FARMER PUB.

Instead of waiting, Micawber-like, for something (a man) to\r\nturn up they are going to work to turn it up themselves. They would\r\nrather make a living for themselves than have a man to make it for them.\r\nThey are teaching schools, operating telegraph instruments and\r\ntelephones, clerking, keeping books of account, type-writing, doing\r\nshort-hand reporting, lecturing, preaching, practicing law, and some\r\nhave so far fallen from grace as to be editing papers. But many of these\r\noccupations present closed doors to our country girls and women. Many of\r\nthese can not leave their country homes, and these occupations, with the\r\nexception of school teaching, can not be carried on in the country.\r\nOthers, who could leave home, are chary of braving the wiles and\r\ntemptations of the city, and their friends are still more loth to have\r\nthem go. The great need is some work, light, respectable, and yet fairly\r\nremunerative, which our country lassies can carry on at home. School\r\nteaching is possible, but teaching country district schools is the most\r\nthankless of all drudgery, and, besides, a majority of our young women\r\nare not able to endure the worry and close confinement. If it can be\r\nmade successful, sericulture offers by far the best opportunity to\r\ncountry girls to earn their own pin money, or even their own living. It\r\ncan be engaged in at home; it is light, pleasant, and interesting work;\r\nand there is no doubt that American silk can be produced of such a\r\nquality that there will be a brisk demand for it at good prices. But if\r\nall this be true the question at once presents itself, Why have not\r\nAmerican women engaged largely in sericulture?\r\n\r\nThe answer is that they have been appalled at the very outset by the\r\nalleged expense of the undertaking. The promoters of the enterprise took\r\nto writing books. There was an excuse for this amounting almost to a\r\nnecessity. To engage in silk culture, a person must be possessed of some\r\nspecial knowledge. It is no harder than poultry or bee-keeping, but a\r\nperson to succeed at these must have some expert knowledge, and as\r\nsericulture was a new thing, beginners must have books containing what\r\nthey needed. But these authors made the business much more difficult and\r\nexpensive than it should be. First of all, they laid it down as one of\r\nthe Medes and Persian laws of sericulture, that the worms must have\r\nmulberry leaves to subsist upon. Mulberry sprouts are costly to begin\r\nwith; then the trees must grow at least two years, and should grow five\r\nyears, before the leaves are used. This, of itself, was enough to deter\r\nbut a very few from silk culture. But they made it appear, also, that\r\nvery expensive appliances for a cocoonery were necessary, and only the\r\nmost costly breeds of worms should be used, entailing greater expense\r\nand difficulty. The books were, and for that matter are, filled with dry\r\nscientific details of the internal construction of the worm and of its\r\nhabits--details which only confused the learner and which, though giving\r\nan author material from which to deduce rules of instruction, should\r\nhave been omitted from the book and their place supplied with the rules\r\ndeduced. In short, it seemed to be the prime object to make sericulture\r\nas hard and forbidding as possible, and to deter the people from it\r\nrather than to induce them to engage in the work. For this very reason\r\nthere has been considerable popular indifference to it, and from the\r\nagricultural press it has not received that attention which so promising\r\nan industry deserves. I would not be so unjust as to leave the reader to\r\ninfer that all authors on sericulture have been thus guilty. There have\r\nbeen some very few who from the very start have presented it in as easy\r\nand practicable a light as was consistent with successful work. Nor\r\nwould I be ready to assert that those who have said it could not be made\r\nfinancially profitable without mulberry groves, fancy priced worms, and\r\nexpensive appliances, have done so from base motives. Yet it would\r\nappear as if not a few could be justly indicted of this; for they have\r\nmulberry sprouts, fancy priced worms, and costly appliances to sell. And\r\nperhaps it occurred to them that if they deterred the people generally\r\nfrom taking hold of it, they would have less opposition and competition.\r\n\r\nBut be this as it may, the fact is that it is not necessary to have\r\nmulberry groves, costly appliances, or even fancy priced worms (though\r\ngood worms only should be reared), in order to profitably engage in\r\nsericulture. I know of no business presenting so promising an opening\r\nthat requires less capital. And I say this, having no axe to grind in\r\nany way, simply for the sake of those girls and women who might make\r\nmoney by it, and who would do so if they only knew the facts. I have no\r\nbook, no sprouts, no worms, nothing whatever, to sell.\r\n\r\nI have said that the leaves of the mulberry are not essential to silk\r\ngrowing. If this be true the greatest obstacle in the way of sericulture\r\nbecoming a great national industry will have been removed. And that it\r\nis true is proven by the experience of not a few practical silk-growers.\r\nWithout exception those who have tested the matter say that the leaves\r\nof the Osage-orange are equal to those of the mulberry, and some say\r\nthey are better. My position brings me into correspondence with the\r\nleading specialists in agricultural pursuits, and among others with many\r\npractical silk-growers. To-day I received letters from three\r\nsilk-growers, one in Illinois, one in Kansas, and one in California.\r\nEach had fed the leaves of the Osage-orange exclusively for the last two\r\nyears, and with the best results. One said there was no doubt that they\r\nwere at least equal to the leaves of the mulberry, and the other two\r\npronounced them superior. One of our best authorities on sericulture,\r\nProf. Barricelli, has shown by means of chemical analyses and other\r\nscientific data, that as nourishment for silk-worms the Osage is\r\nsuperior to the mulberry. In fact, nine-tenths of the practical\r\nsilk-growers of the West, those who are making it not only practicable\r\nbut profitable, are now feeding Osage leaves exclusively. This should be\r\nknown by the people at large. There can be no monopoly of the\r\nOsage-orange. No one can demand of the expectant silk culturist\r\nexorbitant prices for Osage sprouts. In very few localities will it be\r\nnecessary to plant the Osage even. We have an abundance of Osage hedges,\r\nparticularly in the West. In such localities the silk culturist will be\r\nat no expense whatever for food for the worms, and will not be under\r\neven the necessity of waiting a couple of years for it to grow. When\r\nthis is more fully understood by the girls and women of the country, we\r\nmay expect silk culture to assume the importance of a profitable\r\nnational industry.\r\n\r\nJOHN M.

Each heavy load\r\n      Would be a golden treasure;\r\n    Pain and vexation be forgot;\r\n    Hope would prevail in every lot,\r\n      And life be only pleasure.\r\n\r\n--_Wolstan Dixey._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHAT ABOUT THE FASHIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the lady readers of THE PRAIRIE FARMER have probably\r\nby this time made up the heavier part of their winter wardrobe, still a\r\nfew suggestions may not be out of place, for the \"fashions\" is a subject\r\nof which we seldom tire.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the subject of silk and silk-culture at the late Woman's\r\nCongress, Mrs Julia Ward Howe said that \"although silk is said to be\r\ndepreciating in value, and is not quite as popular as formerly, yet we\r\nmust confess it lies very near the feminine heart,\" at which statement\r\nan audible smile passed over the audience, as each one acknowledged to\r\nherself its truth.\r\n\r\nWe are glad to see that wrappers are becoming quite \"the thing\" for\r\nafternoon home wear, and a lady now need not feel at all out of place\r\nreceiving her callers in a pretty, gracefully made wrapper. The Watteau\r\nwrapper is made of either silk or brocaded woolen goods, conveniently\r\nshort, the back cut square at the neck, and folded in a handsome Watteau\r\nplait at the center, with a full ruche effect. A yolk portion of silk\r\nfills in the open neck and is sewed flatly underneath to the back. The\r\nside seams are curved so that a clinging effect is produced at the\r\nsides. Jabbots of lace extending down the front, and a prettily bowed\r\nribbon at the right shoulder, with a standing collar at the neck, and a\r\nlinen choker collar give the finishing touches to the toilette.\r\n\r\nVelvets and velveteens seem to be taking the place of silk, and are\r\nreally quite as cheap. In fact, velveteens are cheaper, as they are so\r\nmuch wider. A suit of velveteen is fashionable for any occasion--for\r\nreceptions, church or street costume. The redingote or polonaise is very\r\nstylish and pretty, especially for a tall, rather slight person. For a\r\nyoung miss the close-fitting frock coat, with pointed vest effectively\r\ndisclosed between the cut-away edges of the coat fronts, is much worn.\r\nThe latter curve away from the shoulders and are nicely rounded off at\r\ntheir lower front corners. An underarm dart gives a smooth adjustment\r\nover each hip, and in these darts are inserted the back edges of the\r\nvest. Buttons and buttonholes close the vest, but the coat fronts do not\r\nmeet at all. The coat and long-pointed overskirt can be made of any\r\nheavy material, but the vest should be of silk; a deep box-plait on the\r\nbottom of the underskirt made of silk to match the vest will make the\r\nsuit very stylish and pretty.\r\n\r\nThere ought to be great satisfaction among the wearers of bonnets and\r\nhats this season, because they can so easily have what they want--big or\r\nlittle, plain or decorated, as they please. For a person with dark hair,\r\ngold braid loosely put around the edge of a velvet capote is very\r\nbecoming. Bunches of tips are worn much more than the long, drooping\r\nplumes, though both are fashionable; while birds--sometimes as many as\r\nthree on a hat--are often preferred to either. We notice upon the street\r\na great many elegantly dressed ladies with but a single band of wide\r\nvelvet ribbon fastened somewhat carelessly around the bonnet and tied in\r\na bow under the chin. Unique it may be, but undoubtedly the taste of the\r\nwearer, would be the verdict of the passer by. In fact, one can scarcely\r\nbe out of the fashion in the choice of a bonnet or hat, but care should\r\nbe taken that it be just the thing for the wearer, and that it be\r\nproperly put on.\r\n\r\nI firmly believe in the doctrine that \"good clothes tendeth toward\r\ngrace.\" What woman can not talk better when she knows she looks well?\r\nShe can then forget herself and lose all self-consciousness, which is a\r\nstate most devoutly to be desired by all women--particularly our young\r\nwomen. So, girls, study your costumes, especially the \"superfluities,\"\r\nor \"furbelows,\" as they are wont to be called; make yourselves look as\r\npretty as you possibly can--and then forget yourselves.\r\n\r\nI wish all our lady readers might have been here the holiday week, for\r\nthe stores were perfect bowers of beauty. It was a pretty sight in\r\nitself to watch the crowds of happy-faced children, with their little\r\npocket-books in their hands, at the various counters buying presents for\r\nfather, mother, brothers, and sisters. Children always enjoy Christmas\r\nmore when they can make, as well as receive, presents. So I hope all our\r\nlittle readers were made happy by both giving and receiving.\r\n\r\nI am sorry I could not give you a more satisfactory talk on the\r\nfashions, but our space is limited this week. I hope the ladies will not\r\nforget that our \"Household\" department is open to them, and that they\r\nwill contribute anything that may be of interest to the others.\r\n\r\nMARY HOWE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA KITCHEN SILO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe farmer's wife in the Netherlands has long been using a sort of a\r\nsilo. Probably she had been doing so for long years before M. Geoffrey\r\nbegan experimenting with preserved stock food in France. The Netherland\r\nhousewife's silo consists of an earthenware jar about two feet tall.\r\nInto one of these jars in summer time she places the kidney bean; in\r\nanother shelled green peas; in another broad beans, and so on. Making a\r\nlayer about six inches deep in each. She sprinkles a little salt on top\r\nand presses the whole firmly down. Then she adds another layer and more\r\nsalt. She leaves a light weight on top to keep all well pressed down and\r\nexclude the air, in the intervals between pickings for often the harvest\r\nof a single day will not fill the jar. When full, she puts on a heavier\r\nweight, and covers all with brown paper. She thus has green vegetables\r\npreserved for winter. The ensilage is said to be \"more or less good,\r\naccording to taste.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHICKEN SALAD: Two common sized fowls, one teacup of good salad\r\noil, half a jar of French sweet mustard, the hard-boiled yolks of ten\r\neggs, half a pint of vinegar, one teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, eight\r\nheads of celery, one teaspoon of salt or a little more if required. Cut\r\nand mix the chicken and celery and set away in a cool place. Mash the\r\neggs to a paste with the oil, then add the vinegar and other things, mix\r\nthoroughly, but do not pour it over the salad until about half an hour\r\nbefore serving, as the celery may become wilted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSOFT GINGERBREAD: One cup butter and two cups sugar well worked\r\ntogether, three eggs well beaten in, one cup New Orleans molasses, one\r\ncup good sweet milk and five cups of flour into which has been stirred\r\none teaspoonful baking powder, not heaped, two tablespoonfuls ground\r\ncinnamon and one tablespoonful ground ginger.

Perhaps not all of you\r\nas yet, though many of you doubtless will as the years roll on--and, by\r\nthe way, you will find that the older you grow the more quickly will\r\nthey speed away. So be careful in this, the beautiful springtime of your\r\nlives, to so cultivate and make ready the garden of your minds that the\r\ncoming manhood and womanhood may not only find you with well developed\r\narms and limbs and muscles, ready to face the world and to help lift\r\nsome of its burdens, but also with a mind that has kept even pace with\r\nthe body--because of constant _growth_.\r\n\r\nWe think we will have to depart from our usual natural history articles\r\nsome day, and have a talk with the boys and girls on this subject of\r\ngrowth--growth in its largest, broadest sense, the mind, soul, and body\r\nall growing together into the stature of a perfect man.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the lion. This animal is the largest of the cat family\r\nand is found, only in Asia and Africa. The Asiatic lion is not so large\r\nnor so fierce as the African, and has a much smaller mane. The mane of\r\nthe African lion is long and thick, and gives the animal a very noble\r\nappearance; the female, however, has no mane. The lion is always of one\r\ncolor, that is, without spots or stripes, generally tawny, though the\r\nmane is dark sometimes nearly black. The lion gets its full growth when\r\nseven or eight years old, and lives usually about twenty-five years,\r\nthough some have been known to live much longer in menageries.\r\n\r\nThese animals see much better in the night than in the day, so they\r\ngenerally hide away during the day and search for food in the gray dawn\r\nof the morning. They feed chiefly on antelopes, zebras, giraffes, and\r\nwild cattle. It is said that the lion rarely attacks man, only in cases\r\nof extreme hunger; indeed, they seem somewhat afraid of man. Dr.\r\nLivingstone says that when the lion meets a man in daylight it will stop\r\ntwo or three seconds to stare at him, then turn slowly round and walk\r\noff a few steps, looking over its shoulder, then begin to trot, and when\r\nat last he thinks he is no longer seen will bound away like a hare. The\r\nDoctor says also, that the roar of the lion is very like the cry of the\r\nostrich, but the former roars only at night, however, while the latter\r\ncries only by day.\r\n\r\nDid you not think it wonderful when you saw for the first time, perhaps,\r\na keeper walk boldly into the lions' cage, when in their natural state\r\nthey are so very fierce and wild? Well, we think it is wonderful,\r\nalthough the keepers tell us that they are easily tamed.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times they were used in many more ways than they are now.\r\nHanno, the Carthaginian general, had a lion to carry his baggage, and\r\nMark Antony often rode through the streets of Rome in a chariot drawn by\r\nlions. A short time ago we read a story of a slave named Androclus, who,\r\nwhile hiding away from his master in the deserts of Africa, cured a lion\r\nof lameness by pulling a thorn out of its foot. The slave was afterward\r\ncaught, carried to Rome, and condemned to be eaten by the wild beasts.\r\nHe was thrown into a lion's den, but the beast, instead of killing him\r\nfawned upon him and showed the greatest delight at seeing him; Androclus\r\nwas surprised to find that it was the same lion whose foot he had cured\r\nin the desert. The Emperor, it is said, was so much pleased at the sight\r\nthat he gave the slave his pardon, and presented him also with the lion,\r\nafter which he used to lead the great beast tamely through the streets,\r\nheld simply by a little chain.\r\n\r\nIn modern times, also, lions have been known to exhibit strong\r\nfriendship for man. In 799, two lions in the Jardin des Plantes (Garden\r\nof Plants), at Paris, became so fond of their keeper that when he was\r\ntaken sick they gave signs of the greatest sorrow, and when he recovered\r\nand came back to them they rushed to meet him, roaring with joy,\r\nmeanwhile licking his hands and face.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have read of Theodorus, King of Abyssinia (he killed himself\r\nin 1868), who used to keep several tame lions in his palace and treated\r\nthem almost like dogs.\r\n\r\nTravelers tell us, too, that these great animals often show fondness for\r\nother animals, as, for instance, an old lioness belonging to the Dublin\r\nZoological Gardens was taken sick, and was greatly annoyed by the rats.\r\nAt last a little terrier dog was put into the cage, but was received by\r\nthe lioness with a surly growl; finally when the old animal saw the\r\nlittle dog could kill her enemies, the rats, she coaxed him to her, and\r\npetted and fondled him, so that they soon became great friends.\r\n\r\nThe lion is a mammal of the order carnivora, or flesh-eating animals.\r\n\r\nThe word lion comes from the Latin leo, Greek leon, lion.\r\n\r\nWould you like me to tell you next week about a bear I saw upon the\r\nhills of Nova Scotia, near the scene of Longfellow's beautiful\r\nEvangeline, a few months ago?\r\n\r\nMARY HOWE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA JACK-KNIFE GENIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Louis Post-Dispatch: William Yohe claims to be the champion\r\njack-knife artist of the day, although he was born in St. Louis and not\r\nYankeedom. A reporter heard of this professional lacerator of pine\r\nsticks and sought him out. It was not until the inside of an unused\r\nMethodist church at Kirkwood, this county, was reached that Mr. Yohe and\r\nhis knife was cornered. The knife was slashing cigar-boxes to pieces at\r\nrailway speed when the reporter opened up with: \"Are you the man who\r\nmakes an automatic world's fair and St. Louis Exposition with a knife?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that isn't what I call it. I am making what I call the Missouri\r\nPacific and Strasburg Cathedral Automatic Wonder, with the Golden Ark of\r\nthe Covenant. It will contain over 180,000 pieces and will have 1,100\r\nmoving and working figures.\"\r\n\r\nAll around the gaunt and dismantled church were piles of cigar-boxes and\r\nlaths and myriads of nicely-carved pieces of wood, apparently portions\r\nof models of buildings. The whittler was a small man, with keen eyes and\r\nready tongue and about thirty-six years of age. In the course of an\r\nhour's conversation he said in substance: \"I didn't know that I was\r\nanything extra of a whittler until about 1869, when, in a small way, I\r\nmade some models. I was in Texas working at millwrighting. The first\r\nlarge piece I ever made was a model of a Bermuda castle. Afterward I\r\nmade Balmoral Castle, Bingen Castle, Miramar Castle, and the Texas State\r\nCapitol at Austin. Solomon's Temple contained 12,268 pieces and had\r\n1,369 windows. It is now on exhibition in Texas. The Austin Capitol\r\nBuilding has 62,844 pieces and 561 moving people. Every room and\r\ndepartment in the building was given, with all the officers and\r\nlegislators. Everybody was represented, down to the man sawing wood in\r\nthe basement for the furnaces. All the figures were moved by a wooden\r\nengine, which was run by sand falling on an overshot wheel. I made this\r\npiece at odd moments in 1881.\r\n\r\n\"I have just hired this church and begun steady work. I shall sleep and\r\neat in this church until about May 1, next. The material? Yes, it does\r\ntake considerable. I have already used up 967 cigar boxes and 300 laths.\r\nIt will take in all 1,800 cigar boxes, 500 laths, and 500 feet of\r\nlumber. The cigar boxes I get for one cent each. I used no tools except\r\nmy knife.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLittle Johnny Botts found a garter snake in the park the other\r\nday and he brought it home and hid it in the piano.

Author unknown. NEW\r\nYORK: D. Appleton & Co. CHICAGO: Jansen, McClurg & Co. 12mo. Cloth.\r\nPrice, $1.50.\r\n\r\nThis is a romance of the church in the latter part of the third and the\r\nbeginning of the fourth centuries. The scene is laid near Cyrene, A.D.\r\n265. It is an exquisitely written idyl of primitive Christian life, and\r\ncan not fail to attract a great deal of attention, especially now that\r\nthe public mind is being turned in the direction of early church\r\nhistory. It deals in a powerful, yet simple, manner with that subtle\r\nquestion, the Trinity of the Godhead, and gives the reader many new\r\nthoughts in connection with it. The characters portrayed awaken an\r\nunusual degree of interest, being as they are, persons eminent in\r\nhistory, both secular and religious. As one follows the story to its\r\nclose he can not but agree with the author, that Arius, the hero and\r\narch-heretic of the Nicene age, was \"one of the grandest, purest, least\r\nunderstood, and most systematically misrepresented characters in human\r\nhistory.\" The latter portion of the book brings out, prominently, the\r\nreal character of Constantine, stigmatized by Arius as \"that unbaptised\r\npagan, the flamen of Jupiter.\" The noble plan of the book and the grave\r\nimportance of the questions that agitate the characters, combine to make\r\nit a valuable production to both believer and skeptic.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANS OF SPEECH. By G.H. Von Meyer, Professor In Ordinary of\r\nAnatomy at the University of Zurich. NEW YORK: D. Appleton &\r\nCo. CHICAGO: Jansen, McClurg & Co. 12 mo. Cloth. Price $1.75.\r\n\r\nThis book is the forty-sixth volume in the international scientific\r\nseries, and needs no better introduction than the well-known name of the\r\nauthor. The subject of the organs of speech and their application in the\r\nformation of articulate sounds is treated in a masterly and exhaustive\r\nmanner. The object of the author has been not merely \"to enter into the\r\nfield of discussion upon the various modifications of sounds, * * but to\r\nbring forward a sufficient number of examples in confirmation of the\r\nlaws explained,\" in which purpose he has most admirably succeeded. The\r\nwork contains forty-seven wood cuts, and will be a valuable addition to\r\nany library. We would recommend it especially to teachers of vocal music\r\nand declamation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTY YEARS' RECOLLECTIONS. By Jeriah Bonham PEORIA, ILL.: J.W.\r\nFranks & Sons. Sold by subscription.\r\n\r\nThis is a carefully compiled work, giving the author's observations and\r\nreflections on the historical events of Illinois for the past fifty\r\nyears, it also gives very interesting and full biographical sketches of\r\nmany of the prominent men who have, during this time, figured in the\r\naffairs of the State, so far as Mr. Bonham's personal acquaintanceship\r\nand recollections extend. The sketches, condensed, yet complete, of the\r\nsixteen Governors of Illinois, from Shadrach Bond, the first Governor,\r\ndown to the present time are especially interesting. The book will be\r\nenjoyed by the old settlers of the State on account of its personal\r\nreminiscences, which are all true, not drawn from the imagination.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Youth's Companion, Boston, is another famous, and deservedly so,\r\nAmerican juvenile publication.

WIMBUSH'S REVENGE.\r\n\r\n(_Concluded from last week._)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a large picnic party. Mr. Charles Brookshank had drawn Mrs.\r\nWimbush's arm through his own, and strolled away from the rest.\r\n\r\n\"How delightful it would be if one could know the language of birds, as\r\nfolks did in the old Hindu fairy tales! Would it not, Mr. Brookshank?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mrs. Wimbush, they do nothing the whole day long but make love\r\nand cry 'Sweet, sweet!' I would I were a bird, to make love in music.\"\r\n\r\nThe widow sighed, but it was more like a purr of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"What did I know of love till you came here?\" continued Mr. Charles.\r\n\"Absolutely nothing--except,\" he added, with reservation, \"in a\r\nprofessional way. And then we lawyers generally see the dark side of the\r\npicture--the damages and the decrees nisi. But your visit has brightened\r\nmy whole life. O Mrs. Wimbush, you can not have been blind to my secret!\r\nYou have seen it written legibly in my face, and have not interposed to\r\ncheck its development. I see you understand me, just as by intuitive\r\nfine feeling you can penetrate the meaning of Mendelssohn's Songs\r\nwithout Words. Mrs. Wimbush, you have already far advanced toward\r\nlearning the birds' language. I may rely upon your consent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Charles, this happiness is indeed too much,\" ejaculated the widow.\r\n\r\n\"You need never be separated from your daughter Carry. A home for one is\r\na home for both; and I will cherish her while I live.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Charles dear, she may marry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marry, ma'am? Bless my soul, of course she will! She will marry me! She\r\nhas said so, don't you see?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wimbush never said another word, but fell flat down upon the grass.\r\n\r\n\"What on earth has got the woman?\" thought Mr. Charles. \"She couldn't\r\nhave taken it worse if I had proposed to murder her daughter.\"\r\n\r\nIn their walk they had strayed through the trees close to the outskirts\r\nof another picnic party. Mr. Charles immediately ran to ask some fair\r\nvolunteer to come to the assistance of Mrs. Wimbush, who had fainted. At\r\nhearing the name, an active middle-aged lady sprang up and followed him.\r\nIt was Mrs. Marrables. The sight of her mother brought Mrs. Wimbush\r\nround quicker than any smelling bottle could have done. She sat up.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, Mr. Brookshank; Mr. Brookshank, my mother, Mrs. Marrables.\"\r\nThey bowed. \"Have the goodness to leave us together, Mr. Charles.\" He\r\nbowed and obeyed. \"Mother,\" said Mrs. Wimbush, \"what on earth brought\r\nyou here? I thought you were at Taunton.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, dear. I have been at Bournemouth three weeks, I came merely for\r\nchange. Only last week I heard of your being here, and should have\r\ncalled, but have been so much occupied, and I felt sure of meeting you\r\nsomewhere, and thought the surprise might be the more agreeable. We've\r\nhad a most delightful picnic with the Mount Stewart folks. But what was\r\nall this fainting about? One would think Mr. Brookshank had been\r\nproposing to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"He certainly made me a proposal mother, but I was quite unprepared for\r\nit, and was overcome.\"\r\n\r\n\"What an imaginative and sensitive-minded girl you must be, Matilda! You\r\nmake me feel quite young. When will you be old enough to attend to\r\nbusiness? You will accept him, of course? Well, do as you please; you\r\nmay reckon on my consent, you know. But I must get back to my party, and\r\nperhaps you had better rejoin yours. Ta-ta.\"\r\n\r\nJilted for her daughter! It wasn't pleasant. When Mrs. Wimbush got home,\r\nshe blew up Carry for being so sly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, mamma,\" said Carry, \"of course I thought you knew all about it. I\r\nnever made any secret of the affair. I knew very well that you had\r\nrejected Mr. Tom, but I could not possibly suppose that was any reason\r\nwhy I should refuse Charles. Of course he is older than I am, but he is\r\nonly five-and-thirty, and has a good position; and I am sure we shall\r\nalways give you a welcome; Charles said so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" thought Mrs. Wimbush, \"he has money, and it will be all in the\r\nfamily; that's at least a comfort.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of the little episode of the last chapter was that the\r\nbrothers were made friends, and Tom recovered his spirits, and could\r\nlaugh heartily at what he had before supposed was his brother's rivalry.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wimbush repented her that she had rejected Mr. Tom. Her repentance\r\nproduced a salutary desire on her part to make atonement for the past.\r\nShe would have him yet. When a widow says so much as that about a man,\r\nlet him 'ware hawk.\r\n\r\nA month went by, and behold Mrs Wimbush and Mr. Tom Brookshank seated\r\ntete-a-tete at an evening party, where the music which was going on was\r\nsufficiently loud to render private conversation inaudible save to those\r\nto whom it was addressed.\r\n\r\n\"I fear,\" said the widow, affecting an absent manner, \"I treated you\r\nvery unkindly, Mr. Tom. You took me so entirely by surprise, that,\r\nreally, I--hardly know what I said. I have been very unhappy about\r\nit--very.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forgotten and forgiven,\" whispered Mr. Tom.\r\n\r\n\"How generous of you! you make me so glad! because now that your brother\r\nCharles is going to marry my daughter, we shall be in some sort related,\r\nand I could not bear you to think unkindly of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mr. Tom, fidgeting a little, \"I shall never do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"How droll!\" said the widow. \"Let me see, what will the relationship be?\r\nYou will be my son-in-law's brother, and consequently I shall be your\r\nmother-in-law once removed. You will have a mother younger than\r\nyourself, Mr. Tom. I hope you will not presume upon her youth to be a\r\nbad boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"All this is very true,\" he answered; \"but I see the relationship in a\r\nfar different light. I shall be your father-in-law, and consequently my\r\nown brother's grandfather-in-law.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mistake, Mr. Tom. Don't you see that Carry--\"\r\n\r\n\"No mistake at all about it, ma'am, for I've promised to marry your\r\nmother, Mrs. Marrables!\"\r\n\r\n\"Monster!\" cried Mrs. Wimbush aloud, and went off shrieking.\r\n\r\nThe music stopped, and there was a great fuss. But above all the others\r\nwas heard the voice of Mrs. Marrables. \"Don't be alarmed, pray. She is\r\nsubject to it; she went off just like that the other day at a picnic.\r\nPoor young thing, a very little upsets her. Let me come to my little\r\ngu-url, then.\"\r\n\r\nThey moved her into another room. Presently Mrs. Wimbush opened her\r\neyes. \"Mother! how dare you come near me! Go away, do! You ought to be\r\nashamed of yourself, at your time of life!\"\r\n\r\n\"My time of life! Why, I'm only fifty-four--about ten years older than\r\nTom. How can you talk so to your mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother, if you don't leave the room, I will. It's really disreputable\r\nto have you for a mother. You've never done me any credit.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear, I am so glad to think you feel well enough to leave the room\r\nthat I will remain.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wimbush got up and went home.\r\n\r\nJilted, first for her daughter, and next for her mother! This was too\r\nmuch. Mrs. Wimbush went to church as regularly as any one, but revenge,\r\nafter all, is very sweet.\r\n\r\nSix weeks afterward Mrs. Wimbush recovered sufficient fortitude to go\r\nand call on her mother.\r\n\r\n\"Well, child, I'm glad you are going to be friendly; there is nothing\r\nlike harmony in a family circle. Let us consider the relationships into\r\nwhich we are about to enter, that we may rightly judge of our\r\nresponsibilities and duties. I and my granddaughter are going to marry\r\ntwo brothers--the consequence is, she and I will be sisters-in-law. But\r\nas you are mother of my sister-in-law, you will nearly be my\r\nmother-in-law, which is a very singular relationship for a daughter to\r\nsustain toward her mother, especially when she is not the wife of one's\r\nfather-in-law. Now, as\"--\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment, dear mamma; I've news for you; I'm going to marry old\r\nUnguent! Old Mr. Brookshank has asked me to be his wife, and I've\r\nconsented. The consequence is, I shall be head of the family, and\r\nbona-fide mother-in-law to you all. I don't think we need trouble about\r\nharmony, for we shall be a united family, more so than any I know of.\"\r\n\r\nBefore her marriage, Mrs. Marrables set to work to draw up a table of\r\nthe relationships involved by the three weddings. It is an extensive\r\nwork in three volumes, and when our readers see The Brookshank Family\r\nadvertised, they will know what it means.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOUR\r\nNew Clubbing List\r\nFOR 1884.\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE FARMER\r\nIN CONNECTION\r\nWITH OTHER JOURNALS.\r\n\r\nWe offer more liberal terms than ever before to those who desire to\r\ntake, in connection with THE PRAIRIE FARMER, either of the\r\nfollowing weekly or monthly periodicals.

KIRKMAN'S BOOKS ON RAILROAD TOPICS.\r\n\r\nDO YOU WANT TO BECOME A RAILROAD MAN\r\n\r\nIF YOU DO, THE BOOKS DESCRIBED BELOW POINT THE WAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most promising field for men of talent and ambition at the present\r\nday is the railroad service. The pay is large in many instances, while\r\nthe service is continuous and honorable. Most of our railroad men began\r\nlife on the farm. Of this class is the author of the accompanying books\r\ndescriptive of railway operations, who has been connected continuously\r\nwith railroads as a subordinate and officer for 27 years. He was brought\r\nup on a farm, and began railroading as a lad at $7 per month. He has\r\nwritten a number of standard books on various topics connected with the\r\norganization, construction, management and policy of railroads. These\r\nbooks are of interest not only to railroad men but to the general reader\r\nas well. They are indispensable to the student. They present every phase\r\nof railroad life, and are written in an easy and simple style that both\r\ninterests and instructs. The books are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"RAILWAY EXPENDITURES--THEIR EXTENT,\r\nOBJECT AND ECONOMY.\"--A Practical\r\nTreatise on Construction and Operation.\r\nIn Two Volumes, 850 pages.                         $4.00\r\n\r\n\"HAND BOOK OF RAILWAY EXPENDITURES.\"--Practical\r\nDirections for Keeping\r\nthe Expenditure Accounts.                           2.00\r\n\r\n\"RAILWAY REVENUE AND ITS COLLECTION.\"--And\r\nExplaining the Organization of\r\nRailroads.                                          2.50\r\n\r\n\"THE BAGGAGE PARCEL AND MAIL TRAFFIC\r\nOF RAILROADS.\"--An interesting work\r\non this important service; 425 pages.               2.00\r\n\r\n\"TRAIN AND STATION SERVICE\"--Giving\r\nThe Principal Rules and Regulations governing\r\nTrains; 280 pages.                                  2.00\r\n\r\n\"THE TRACK ACCOUNTS OF RAILROADS.\"--And\r\nhow they should be kept.

Their complexion is far superior to\r\nours, or our countrymen over the herring pond.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I know what Prof. Huxley says.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what reason does he advance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Huxley says it is owing to the old maids.\"\r\n\r\n\"Owing to old maids! You surprise me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fact. Huxley figures it out this way. Now, you know the English are\r\nvery fond of roast beef.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what has that to do with old maids?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go slow. This genuine English beef is the best and most nutritious beef\r\nin the world, and it imparts a beautiful complexion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, about the old maids?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you see the excellence of this English beef is due exclusively to\r\nred clover. Do you see the point?\"\r\n\r\n\"All but the old maids. They are still hovering in the shadows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, don't you see? This red clover is enriched, sweetened, and\r\nfructified by bumble bees.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where do the old maids come in?\" said the inquisitive American,\r\nwiping his brow wearily.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it is as plain as the nose on your face. The only enemy of the\r\nbumble bee is the field-mouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what have roast beef, red clover, bumble-bees, and field-mice got\r\nto do with old maids?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you must be very obtuse. Don't you perceive that the bumble-bees\r\nwould soon become exterminated by the field-mice if it were not for--\"\r\n\r\n\"Old maids?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, if it were not for cats, the old maids of Old England keep the\r\ncountry thoroughly stocked up with cats, and so we can directly trace\r\nthe effects of the rosy English complexions to the benign cause of\r\nEnglish old maids, at least that's what Huxley says about it, and that's\r\njust where the old maids come in.

Loss about $200,000.\r\n\r\nAmong the distinguished dead of the year may be mentioned\r\nChambord, Gambetta, Gortschakoff, Alexander H. Stephens, Karl Marx,\r\nSchultze-Delitzsche, Turgeneff, and Prof. Anthon.\r\n\r\nIt is reported that the Salters' Company, one of the largest\r\nand most successful of the London guilds, has decided to dispose of its\r\nIrish lands, and is now offering them to tenants on twenty years' time.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1883, up to the close of business Saturday\r\nnight, 7,243,969 gallons of spirits were produced in the Chicago\r\ndistilleries. The total receipts of internal revenue in the first\r\ndistrict of Illinois for the year were $8,774,890.\r\n\r\nThe outcry over the houses of the poor has spread to Paris.\r\nAlarming statistics are published of the increase of overcrowding and\r\nthe consequent spread of disease, and no less than 650 schemes of reform\r\nhave been presented to the Municipal Council. The deaths between 1870\r\nand 1883 have increased per 100,000 inhabitants from 48 to 96 in\r\ntyphoid-fever, from 53 to 101 in diphtheria, from 11 to 74 in small-pox,\r\nfrom 30 to 43 in measles, and from 7 to 18 in scarlet-fever.\r\n\r\nAlarm has been created in French commercial circles by rumors\r\nthat the American Congress will make reprisals for the prohibition by\r\nFrance of the importation of American salted meats by passing a law\r\nincreasing the duties on French wines or providing for the seizure of\r\nFrench adulterations. The National, of Paris, says: \"France must expect\r\nthat the Reprisals bill now before Congress, which was first directed\r\nagainst Germany, will now be turned against France.\"\r\n\r\nP.T. Barnum has just made his will. In order that there might\r\nbe no question as to his sanity upon which to ground contests after his\r\ndeath, he had eminent physicians examine him, and secured their\r\nattestation that he was of sound mind. The will and its codicils cover\r\nmore than 700 pages of legal cap, closely written, and disposes of real\r\nestate and personal property of the value of $10,000,000 to twenty-seven\r\nheirs. The property is in New York, Brooklyn, Bridgeport, Colorado, and\r\nseveral other places. Mr. Barnum values his interest in the Barnum and\r\nLondon Shows at $3,500,000. He gives largely to charitable institutions.\r\n\r\nThe number of lives lost by the more noticeable accidents of\r\nlast year give a total of 125,000, or over 342 for each of the 365 days\r\nof 1883. These colossal figures are attained principally through the\r\nresults of three calamities--Ischia, Java, and Syria. Aside from the\r\nearthquakes the year was unequaled in shipwrecks, cyclones, fire-scenes,\r\nand mining horrors. Over thirty people were killed for each day in\r\nJanuary, the Newhall fire, the Russian circus horror, and the Cimbria\r\nshipwreck being the principal of thirty calamities during the month.\r\nThree hundred and ninety-eight people went down in the Cimbria alone.\r\nTwo hundred and seventy people burned in the circus at Berditcheff. The\r\npanic later on at Sunderland, England, caused the death of 197 children\r\nand 150 workmen were drowned like rats in the tub called the Daphne on\r\nthe Clyde. There were 1,697 murders, 107 executions, 135 lynchings, and\r\n727 suicides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKETS\r\n\r\nMARKET REPORTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICE OF THE PRAIRIE FARMER,\r\nCHICAGO. Jan. 2, 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.\r\n\r\nThe general bank business of Chicago last week was rather dull. But few\r\nnew business contracts were made as everyone was waiting for the New\r\nYear to begin before extending business.\r\n\r\nIn the loan market money was quoted throughout the week at 6@7 per cent\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nEastern exchange opened Saturday at 25c off between banks, but\r\nsubsequently sales were made at 25c per $1,000 premium.

Shipped.\r\nCattle                            27,295     11,368\r\nHogs                              89,505     22,450\r\nSheep                              9,417      4,856\r\n\r\nCATTLE.--The above figures show a falling off of 18,850 head from the\r\nprevious week's receipts. This contraction on the part of shippers is\r\nsaid to have been on account of advice from the commission men who argue\r\nthat the unusual demand during Christmas week following the previous\r\nlarge supply would not be very large. Dressed-beef operators bought\r\nfreely and there was a general advance in prices. The quality of the\r\nbeef was not first-class. The highest price paid for the best was $6 65\r\nper cwt. Sales were principally at $5@6. Common lots brought $4 25@4 95.\r\nSome poor ones went at $4. Cows for butchers sold at $3@4, and inferior\r\nlots at $2@2 90. Bulls brought from $2 to $4 75. A few car loads of\r\nTexans sold at $3 50@4 50 per cwt. Veal calves brought $4@7 for 100 lbs.\r\nMilch cows were lower as the supply has been large. There was a falling\r\noff of about $10 per head; they sold for $25 to 55 per head.\r\n\r\nHOGS.--During the past week they formed a strong combination to break\r\nthe market, all the 20 packing houses doing business here agreeing to\r\nbuy only a stipulated number of hogs each day. The plan worked as was\r\nanticipated, and although the receipts for the week dropped to 89,000\r\nagainst 187,470 during the previous week, there was a steady decline\r\nfrom day to day. Shippers were good buyers, taking on an average 5,500\r\nhogs daily, but city packers bought only about 11,000 or 12,000, leaving\r\nat times upwards of 28,000 or 30,000 unsold at the close of the day.\r\nChoice hogs declined only moderately, but other descriptions were very\r\nweak. Up to date there have been packed in the West this season about\r\n100,000 head more than to same time last year. The market closed on\r\nSaturday at $4 65@5 90 for heavy; $4 60@5 30 for light, and $3 25@4 60\r\nfor skips and culls.\r\n\r\nNote.--All sales of hogs are made subject to a shrinkage of 40 lbs for\r\npiggy sows and 80 lbs for stags. Dead hogs sell for 1-1/2c per lb for\r\nweights of 200 and over and [Transcriber's Note: blank in original] for\r\nweights of less than 100 lbs.\r\n\r\nSHEEP.--The demand has been brisk and prices for good lots advanced\r\nfully 25c per cwt. The receipts have fallen off greatly. Sales were made\r\nof common to choice at $2 50@4 65. No fancy droves were received, and\r\nthey were nominal at $4 75@5.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION MERCHANTS.\r\n\r\nJ.H.
