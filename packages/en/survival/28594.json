Its\r\ndirections, therefore, are intended for the beginner, and are such as\r\nwill enable any intelligent person who has followed farming, to raise\r\ngood crops of Peanuts, although he may have never before seen the\r\ngrowing plant.\r\n\r\nThe writer has confined himself to a recital of the more important\r\ndetails, leaving the minor points to be discovered by the farmer\r\nhimself. If the reader should think these pages devoid of vivacity, let\r\nhim remember that we have treated of an every-day subject in an\r\nevery-day style. The interest in the theme will increase when the\r\nbeginner has pocketed the returns from his first year's crop. Until\r\nthen, we leave him to plod his way through the details, trusting that\r\nthe great Giver of the harvest will bless his labors, and amply reward\r\nhis toils in this new field.\r\n\r\n                B.

Like many other extensively cultivated plants,\r\nit has not been found in a truly wild state. Some botanists regard the\r\nplant as a native of Africa, and brought to the New World soon after its\r\ndiscovery. Sloane, in his history of Jamaica, states that peanuts formed\r\na part of the provisions taken by the slave ships for the support of the\r\nnegroes on the voyage, and leaves it to be inferred that the plant was\r\nintroduced in this manner. De Candolle, in _Géographie Botanique\r\nRaisonnée_, and his latter work on _L'Origine des Plantes Cultivées_,\r\nstrongly inclines to the American origin of the Peanut. The absence of\r\nany mention of the plant by early Egyptian and Arabic writers, and the\r\nfact that there is no name for it in Sanscrit and Bengalese, are\r\nregarded as telling against its Oriental origin. Moreover, there are six\r\nother species of _Arachis_, natives of Brazil, and Bentham and Hooker,\r\nin their _Genera Plantarum_, ask if the plant so generally grown in warm\r\ncountries may not be a cultivated form of a Brazilian species.\r\n\r\nIf, as seems probable, the Peanut is really a native of America, then\r\nthis Continent has contributed to the agricultural world five plants\r\nthat have exerted, and will continue to exert, an immense influence on\r\nthe industries and commerce of the world. These are: the Potato, Cotton,\r\nTobacco, Indian Corn, and the Peanut. Of these five, the Peanut, the\r\nlast to come into general and prominent notice, is destined to rival\r\nsome of the others in importance.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been its origin, the Peanut plant has gradually made\r\nits way over an extended area of the warmer parts of both the Old and\r\nNew World, and in North America has gained a permanent foot-hold in the\r\nsoil of the South Atlantic and Gulf States. Nor has it yet reached its\r\nultimate limits, for cultivation and acclimation will inure it to a\r\nsterner climate, until it becomes an important crop in latitudes\r\nconsiderably further north than Virginia. This is indicated by its rapid\r\nspread within the past few years. Remaining long in comparative\r\nobscurity, it was not until a recent period that the Peanut gained\r\nprominence as an agricultural and commercial staple, but since it fairly\r\nstarted, its progress has been rapid and sure.\r\n\r\n=Natural History.=--There are some peculiarities about the Peanut plant\r\nthat make it interesting to the naturalist. Its habit of clinging close\r\nto the soil, the closing together of the leaves at sunset, or on the\r\napproach of a storm, the beautiful appearance of a field of it when full\r\ngrown, and the remarkable wart-like excrescences found upon the roots,\r\nare some of its more notable characteristics. Its striking preference\r\nfor a calcareous soil is another of its peculiarities, the Peanut\r\nproducing more and better crops on this kind of soil than on any other.\r\n\r\nThe Peanut belongs to the Natural Order _Leguminosæ_, or pod-bearing\r\nplants, and this particular member of it is as unlike all the rest with\r\nwhich we are acquainted, as can well be conceived. No other grows so\r\nrecumbent upon the soil, and none but this produces seed under ground.\r\n\r\nThe botanical name of the Peanut is _Arachis hypogæa_. The origin of the\r\ngeneric name _arachis_ is somewhat obscure; it is said to come from _a_,\r\nprivative, and _rachis_, a branch, meaning having no branches, which is\r\nnot true of this plant. The specific appellation, _hypogæa_, or\r\n\"under-ground,\" describes the manner in which the pods grow. The\r\nfollowing is a partially technical description of the plant:\r\n\r\nRoot annual, branched, but not fibrous, yellowish, bitter, and warty;\r\nStem procumbent, spreading, much-branched, somewhat hairy towards the\r\nextremities; Leaves compound, leaflets obovate, mucronate, margin\r\nentire, ciliate when young, smooth and almost leathery with age, leaves\r\nclosing at night and in rainy weather; Flowers papilionaceous, yellow,\r\nborne upon the end of an axillary peduncle. After flowering, the\r\nforming-pod is, by the elongation of its stalk, pushed into the soil,\r\nbeneath which it grows and ripens; Legume, or pod indehiscent, woody\r\nand veiny, one to four-seeded; Seed, with a reddish coat, the embryo\r\nwith two large, fleshy cotyledons, and a very short, nearly straight,\r\nradicle. Figure 1 represents a portion of the Peanut plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--PORTION OF THE PEANUT PLANT, showing\r\nhow the minute pods from above-ground flowers are forced into the soil\r\nto grow and ripen.]\r\n\r\n=Varieties.=--While no botanical varieties of _Arachis hypogæa_ have\r\nbeen described, its long cultivation in different countries in unlike\r\nsoils and climates, has produced several cultural varieties. Taking the\r\nVirginia Peanut as the typical form, there may be named as differing\r\nfrom it, the North Carolina Peanut, having very small but solid and\r\nheavy pods, that weigh twenty-eight pounds to the bushel. The Tennessee\r\nPeanut is about the size of the Virginia variety, but has a seed of a\r\nmuch redder color and less agreeable flavor. There is a Bunch variety,\r\nthat does not spread out like a mat over the soil, but grows upright\r\nlike the common field pea. This last kind has been raised to some extent\r\nin Virginia, but has never become popular with planters, and is fast\r\npassing out of cultivation. It is possible that the Bunch Peanut is a\r\nrepresentative of the plant in its wild state. It produces fewer seeds\r\nand less vine than any other kind. The flat or spreading Peanut shows a\r\ntendency to sport in this direction, and in any large field of peanuts,\r\nquite a number of plants will be found that have the bunch form, and\r\nsuch are always barren or seedless hills.\r\n\r\nThe small-podded, or North Carolina Peanut, is not at all popular with\r\npickers, because it takes a great many more to make a basketful, and,\r\nunless they are paid an extra price for picking this sort, they cannot\r\nmake as good wages. Nor do our planters seem to like it very well,\r\nfinding it more trouble to handle than the larger variety. Hence it is\r\nbut little cultivated in Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe Peanut in its travels has also acquired a variety of names, such as\r\nground-pea, earth-nut, goober[1] or guber, and pindar. Also \"currency,\"\r\n\"cash,\" \"credit,\" and other expressive titles. Of all these names,\r\n\"Peanut\" is the most generally used, but Ground-pea would be the more\r\ndescriptive name.\r\n\r\n=Possible Range.=--From a somewhat careful study of the climatic\r\nrequirements of the Peanut plant, and of the isotherms of summer\r\ntemperature, we are satisfied that it would thrive as far north as the\r\nnorthern limit of the zone of the vine. This for the United States, as\r\ndelineated in Mitchell's Physical Geography, starts on the Pacific Coast\r\nin the latitude of British Columbia, turns suddenly south along the\r\nCordilleras to Colorado, then trends as suddenly northward to the\r\nnorthern limits of Iowa, strikes eastwardly along a line to the south of\r\nthe great lakes, and enters the Atlantic in the vicinity of Cape Cod. If\r\nour view is correct, the Peanut will thrive on any suitable soil within\r\nthe limits of the United States lying to the south of this line. This\r\nwould make the cultivation of the Peanut possible in by far the greater\r\npart of the entire country. In fact, there is no doubt but that it may\r\nbe grown successfully wherever Indian corn will thrive luxuriantly. Any\r\nsection having a growing season of five months exempt from frost, may\r\nraise the Peanut. This gives the crop a much wider range than has been\r\nthought possible. It does not require a long period of extreme heat to\r\nmature it. The seeds are mostly formed in the cooler weather of the\r\nlatter part of summer and the first of autumn. Planted in June,\r\ncultivated until August or a little later, and harvested the last of\r\nSeptember, it can be perfected in four months, though the Virginia\r\nplanter takes five months for it. Any good calcareous soil, west of New\r\nJersey and southward, that is not too elevated, will grow the Peanut.\r\n\r\n=Analysis.=--This, perhaps, is not a matter of much practical importance\r\nto the planter. The best peanut soil and the proper fertilizer had been\r\nfound out before an analysis of the plant had been made. Still there are\r\nsome advantages in knowing what are the prominent elements that enter\r\ninto the composition of this, or any other, cultivated plant, and an\r\nanalysis is accordingly given.\r\n\r\nAn analysis made by Doctor Thomas Antisell, chemist to the Department of\r\nAgriculture at Washington, and published in the Report of that\r\nDepartment about the year 1869, gives the following as the composition\r\nof the Peanut plant:\r\n\r\nIn one hundred parts of the husk and nut taken together\r\n\r\n  Water                                    2.60\r\n  Albuminous, fibrous matter and starch   79.26\r\n  Oil                                     16.00\r\n  Ash                                      2.00\r\n  Loss                                      .14\r\n                                         ------\r\n                                         100.00\r\n\r\nIn one hundred parts of the husk and seed separated:\r\n\r\n                                _Seed._    _Husk._\r\n  Moisture                        2.51       2.61\r\n  Albuminous matter and farina   79.71    traces.\r\n  Cellulose                                 85.48\r\n  Ash                             1.77      11.90\r\n  Oil                            16.00\r\n                                 -----      -----\r\n                                 99.99      99.99\r\n\r\n\"The ash of the seed,\" it was stated by the same authority, \"consists of\r\nsalts wholly soluble in water, composed of the phosphates of alkalies,\r\nwith traces of alkaline, chlorides, and sulphates. The ash of the husk\r\ndiffers, in consisting chiefly of common salt, phosphate of lime and\r\nmagnesia.\"\r\n\r\nThe analysis of the ash of the Peanut, furnished to the _American\r\nAgriculturist_, by H. B. Cornwall, Professor of Analytical Chemistry in\r\nthe John C. Green School of Science, College of New Jersey, Princeton,\r\nand published in that Journal for July, 1880, gives the following as the\r\nmineral elements of this plant:\r\n\r\nPER ONE HUNDRED PARTS OF ASH.\r\n\r\n  Silica                  1.06\r\n  Potash                 44.73\r\n  Soda                   14.60\r\n  Lime                    1.71\r\n  Magnesia               12.65\r\n  Phosphoric acid        17.64\r\n  Sulphuric acid          2.53\r\n  Chlorine                0.15\r\n                         -----\r\n                         95.07\r\n\r\nIn this analysis neither the carbonic acid nor carbon were determined.\r\n\r\nIt was further stated that the kernels yielded 2.08 per cent. of\r\nash.\r\n\r\nThese analyses, the one of the ash, and the other of the seed and husk\r\nin their natural state, are sufficiently full for the purpose in view,\r\nand serve admirably to show the principal elements required in the\r\ngrowth of the Peanut plant. We see that albuminous matter and starch\r\nform a very large per cent., over three-fourths, of the seed. Of course\r\nan article so rich in fat-forming ingredients, must be well suited for\r\nthe food of man or beast. This explains why hogs fed on peanuts take on\r\nfat so readily. Nothing will change the appearance of a poor hog sooner\r\nthan a diet of peanuts. The amount of oil in the seed--sixteen per\r\ncent., makes the Peanut one of the best oil-producing plants in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nOf the mineral constituents, potash forms by far the largest part--44.73\r\nper cent. Soda, magnesia, and phosphoric acid also enter quite largely\r\ninto the composition of this plant. It will be noticed that common salt\r\nplays some part in the make-up of the Peanut.\r\n\r\nSome may wonder at the small amount of lime reported to be present in\r\nthe ash. This may be explained by stating that lime is not _per se_ a\r\nmanure, but a powerful chemical agent when applied to the soil, reducing\r\ninert matter into plant food. Lime appears to be the driving-wheel in\r\nthe laboratory of the soil. Its presence is essential, but it does not\r\ndo all the work itself. Of marl, the best fertilizer yet discovered for\r\nthe Peanut, the principal ingredient of value, is carbonate of lime.\r\nSome of the Virginia marls range as high as seventy and eighty per cent.\r\nin carbonate of lime. This form of lime is very valuable for all\r\nagricultural purposes. Like its more caustic relative, it plays the part\r\nof a solvent and liberator, refines and vitalizes the soil, and causes\r\nother ingredients to perform their part in building up the framework of\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] While \"goober\" may be one of the names of the Peanut in some\r\nlocalities, the plant so-called in Georgia is _Amphicarpæa monoica_, a\r\nnative leguminous plant with two kinds of flowers, one set always\r\nsubterranean, and the other above ground. The under-ground flowers bear\r\nwoody, rounded, one-seeded pods, with a seed closely resembling a\r\nbean.--ED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPLANTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Soil, and Mode of Preparation.=--A warm soil is required by the Peanut.\r\nA light, porous soil in which sand predominates, but not too sandy, warm\r\nand dry, and yet not too dry, but containing some moisture, and open to\r\ncapillary circulation, suits the Peanut best. In all cases the soil most\r\nsuitable for the Peanut must contain a certain amount of calcareous\r\nconstituents. The color of the soil should be gray, with few or no\r\ntraces of iron to stain the pods. As a rule, the brightest pods bring\r\nthe most money, and as the color of the pods is always influenced by\r\nthat of the soil in which they grow, it becomes a matter of importance\r\nto select that which is of the right description. Land of the above\r\nnature and color may be regarded as first-class for this crop. But let\r\nit be distinctly borne in mind, that unless it contains a goodly\r\nper-centage of lime in some form, in an available state, no land will\r\nproduce paying crops of pods, although it may yield large and luxuriant\r\nvines. Of all the forms of lime, that supplied by the marls of the\r\nseaboard section appears to be the best.\r\n\r\nBut any soil that can be put into a friable condition, and kept so\r\nduring the period of cultivation, will produce salable peanuts, provided\r\nit contains enough lime to insure solid pods. If it is known that a\r\npiece of land will produce sound corn, at the rate of from five to ten\r\nbarrels per acre, the planter may rest satisfied, without further\r\nexperiment, that it will yield from forty to seventy-five or eighty\r\nbushels of peanuts. As the cultivation extends, and more land is needed\r\nfor this crop, much of it is being put upon clayey soil, and when well\r\ncultivated, it generally produces heavy peanuts. Indeed, more pounds per\r\nacre may be grown upon some stiff lands than on any light soil, however\r\ncalcareous. But clayey land, or such as is dark or tenacious, will\r\nimpart a stain or dark color to the pods that is objectionable to\r\nbuyers, and hence soils of this nature are generally avoided. A\r\ntenacious soil is also colder and more inert than a light one during the\r\nearlier part of the summer, and as the Peanut plant requires a rather\r\nlong term of warm weather to insure full growth and maturity, a warmer\r\nand quicker soil is preferable. Buyers, however, are not now quite so\r\nparticular as formerly in regard to color, and hence there is more\r\ninducement to plant on any ground that will yield good, solid peanuts,\r\nand it is being more frequently done.\r\n\r\nBut the actual or prospective peanut planter, who has an ash-colored or\r\ngrayish soil, which is sandy and non-adhesive, is fortunate. If he will\r\nkeep it well limed and trashed, or else rotate every fourth or fifth\r\nyear with the Southern Field Pea, or other green crop, and marl, he will\r\nhave land that will continue to produce paying crops of the brightest\r\nand most salable peanuts. There is an abundance of good peanut land all\r\nalong the Atlantic seaboard, from New Jersey to Florida. Doubtless there\r\nis much of it in the Mississippi Valley, even as far north as the lake\r\nregion, and on the Pacific coast from Oregon southward. There is no more\r\nreason for confining the cultivation of the Peanut to the narrow belts\r\nat present occupied, than there is for limiting tobacco to the States\r\nof North Carolina and Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of lime or marl to use at one application depends very much\r\non the nature of the soil and the amount of vegetable matter it\r\ncontains. Generally, fifty bushels of lime, or one hundred and fifty\r\nbushels of marl is a safe application, but if the soil is quite thin,\r\nand contains but little vegetable mould, more than this at one time\r\nwould be attended with risk. The safer plan is, to make several small\r\nannual applications of both marl, and vegetable matter, continuing this\r\nuntil a hundred and fifty bushels of lime, or two hundred and fifty, or\r\nthree hundred bushels of marl have been applied. After this, no more\r\ncalcareous matter will be needed in fifteen or twenty years. Land will\r\nbear large quantities of marl with perfect safety, if kept well stocked\r\nwith some vegetable matter to subdue its caustic effects. But as most of\r\nthe best peanut soil is deficient in this respect, the planter should\r\nbegin cautiously, using small quantities until he has deepened his soil\r\nand supplied it with vegetable mould by trashing the land or turning in\r\ngreen crops.\r\n\r\nIn choosing land for a peanut crop, some attention should be paid to the\r\nprevious crop. The Peanut requires a clean soil, one clear of roots,\r\nbrush, stones, or rubbish of any kind, and hence it should follow some\r\nhoed crop, such as corn, cotton, or tobacco. In Virginia, corn land is\r\ngenerally preferred, and, as in the tide-water section, much of this\r\nland has been heavily marled, it commonly produces well.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the soil for the Peanut is the same as for corn, or\r\nany similar crop, except that more pains should be, and generally are\r\ntaken, to get it in fine and mellow tilth. If it breaks up rough and\r\nturfy, as much land previously in corn is apt to do, it should be\r\nharrowed or dragged until it is fine. Generally, Virginia planters do\r\nnot plow quite so deep for peanuts as they do for corn. This practice\r\nthe writer believes to be unsound. Land should be plowed deep at the\r\noutset for all crops, whatever their nature or manner of growth. Deep\r\nplowing is a corrective of dry weather, and as drouth sometimes tells\r\nheavily on the Peanut plant, as was the case in the season of 1883, it\r\nis always well to plow deep, and give the moisture of the subsoil a\r\nchance to rise upward, and reach the roots during a dry spell. The\r\nformation of a fine, mellow seed bed, is all the preparation a peanut\r\nsoil requires, previous to planting time, apart from the application of\r\nmanures, which is spoken of elsewhere.\r\n\r\n=The Seed.=--With the peanut crop, more than with almost any other, good\r\nseed is a matter of paramount importance. The seed sometimes fails to\r\ngerminate well; before this fact can be discovered, and the ground\r\nre-seeded, unless the first planting was made quite early, the best\r\nseason for planting will have passed, and the crop planted late will\r\nnever be so good as it might have been. On the other hand, a very early\r\nplanting doubles the risk of failure, in fact almost challenges failure\r\nby committing the seed to a soil too cold for germination and a quick\r\ngrowth. It is highly important, then, to have good seed, and to wait\r\nuntil both weather and soil are favorable for speedy germination and\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine whether the seed will germinate well or not, let\r\nthe planter begin to test them early in the spring. Let him take a dozen\r\nor two kernels that appear to be in quality a fair average of the whole\r\nlot of seed on hand, place them in a tumbler with some dampened cotton,\r\nor a piece of sponge, and set the tumbler in a warm place, where the\r\nheat is uniform, and high enough to start the germ in a few days. In a\r\nday or two, if the seeds are good, they will begin to swell, and the\r\nembryo plant will soon begin to grow. Thus, according to the number of\r\nseeds that have germinated out of the number tested, the planter can\r\ncalculate the probable per-centage of good seed. A glass of peanuts\r\ngrowing thus in dampened cotton, presents an interesting study, and is a\r\npretty ornament for the sitting room.\r\n\r\nBut the planter must not rest satisfied with one trial. As soon as the\r\nout-of-door temperature will admit of it, he should try quite a number\r\nof the seeds in the open ground. Selecting a warm, sunny spot, he should\r\nplant from fifty to one hundred kernels, and shelter the place as much\r\nas possible from the cold winds. If these germinate well, the seed may\r\nbe relied upon as good, and no further trial need be made. It is in this\r\nway that the Virginia planter tests his seed every season. About the\r\nfirst of April there is a great testing of the seed peanuts, and,\r\nalthough nearly every planter endeavors to save his own seed, the\r\nquantity of doubtful seed is generally great enough to cause a brisk\r\ndemand for good seed at advanced prices. The method of saving seed\r\npeanuts will be given in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\nSome weeks before planting time, the Virginia farmer, who plants from\r\nfifty to a hundred bushels of peanuts, starts about having them shelled\r\nand assorted, preparatory to planting. This must be done with care, and\r\nfemales are mostly employed to perform this work. The pods are popped\r\nopen with the fingers and thumb, care being taken not to split or bruise\r\nthe kernel; all shrivelled and dark colored kernels are rejected. After\r\nthey are shelled, the seed must be put into bags or baskets, a small\r\nquantity in each parcel, and set where there is a free circulation of\r\nair, until wanted for planting. If a large quantity is bulked together\r\nafter being shelled, or if put in a close box or barrel, even in small\r\nquantities, they are liable to heat, and be prevented from germinating.\r\nThis fact is the result of some costly experience on the part of many\r\nplanters. Thus it becomes necessary to handle the seed with great care\r\nand circumspection throughout. From a bushel to a bushel and a half of\r\npeanuts in the hull, or pod, is estimated to be enough to plant one acre\r\nof ground, the quantity depending on the quality of the seed and the\r\ndistance apart they are to be planted.\r\n\r\n=Time of Planting.=--In Virginia, the first twenty days in May is\r\nregarded as, in the main, the most suitable time for planting. Some\r\nplant as early as the last week in April, and the seasons frequently\r\nfavor this early start, and the crop does well. More, however, plant in\r\nJune than in April, and sometimes planting is delayed until the middle\r\nor last of June. On warm and dry land, there is no great risk in\r\nplanting the first week in May, but on colder land, the planter should\r\nwait until the ground has been warmed by the sun, say the latter part\r\nof the same month. If the farmer has reason to hope for a week or ten\r\ndays of mild, fair weather, he may risk a planting quite early, as in\r\nthat time the seed ought to germinate, and come up sufficiently to make\r\nit sure that it will grow. Once up, the plant will hold its own, and\r\nthough cold rains or winds may retard its growth, and cause it to turn\r\nyellow, it will start anew with the first spell of sunny weather, and\r\nrapidly change color to its normal green. The above dates apply to the\r\nlatitude of Virginia. In the far south, peanut planting begins early in\r\nApril, while north of Virginia, the first half of June would, in most\r\nseasons, be quite early enough to commit the seed to the earth. It\r\nshould not be done anywhere until all danger from frost is passed for\r\nthe season. A very slight frost will destroy the Peanut.\r\n\r\n=How to Plant.=--I come now to consider the mode of planting. Here no\r\nvery inflexible rules can be given. Practice varies greatly, almost\r\nevery planter differing more or less from his brother planters. The\r\nchief points are, to get the seed into the ground at suitable distances\r\napart both ways, to have the seed, after it is planted, raised slightly\r\nabove the general level, and to have the soil so free from clods that\r\nthere will be nothing to hinder the young plant from pushing through\r\nafter it has started. Any mode of planting that will secure these ends\r\nwill effect the purpose.\r\n\r\nIf the ground has been once plowed in the early spring, let it be plowed\r\nagain only a few days before planting time, and if at all rough, or\r\ncloddy, have it harrowed until in fine tilth. When ready to plant, draw\r\nfurrows the same as for corn, two and a half or three feet apart. If\r\nthe land is fresh and strong, and never before in peanuts, make the rows\r\nat least three feet apart. After a year or two on the same ground,\r\npeanut vines will not grow so large as at first, and need not be so far\r\napart, either from row to row, or from hill to hill. When the land is\r\nthin, some plant as near as twenty-seven inches from row to row, and\r\ntwelve inches from hill to hill.\r\n\r\nIf any fertilizer is to be used, let it be put in the furrow before the\r\nridge is formed; a man or boy following the plow and spreading the\r\nfertilizer by hand. A small ridge is then formed by lapping two furrows\r\nover the drill with the turn plow, after which the knocker and dotter\r\nfollow, one leveling the ridge, and the other dotting the row by making\r\nlittle depressions in the soil the proper distance apart for the seeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--THE KNOCKER AND DOTTER COMBINED.]\r\n\r\n=The Knocker and Dotter.=--Sometimes the knocker and dotter are combined\r\nin one, and it is withal a unique implement. Always home-made, it\r\npartakes of all the native roughness and varied ingenuity of the\r\nSouthern planter. The engraving, figure 2, will illustrate the mode of\r\nconstructing this implement. Two pieces of timber are sawed from a log\r\nto serve as wheels, such wood being selected as does not split easily.\r\nThe diameter of the wheel is made the same as the desired distance\r\nbetween the hills, and three wooden pins are inserted equi-distant in\r\nthe circumference, so that the wheels will make three dots, or signs,\r\nfor planting, at each revolution. These wheels are connected by an axle,\r\nand set the same distance apart the rows are to be asunder. Two shafts\r\nare pinned to the axle, and braced in front of the wheels to keep them\r\nsteady. A piece of heavy scantling, or a log of wood, six inches in\r\ndiameter, is secured to the under side of the shafts just in front of\r\nthe wheels. This is the knocker, and serves to level the ridge before\r\nthe wheels. Properly adjusted, it does beautiful work, and leaves a\r\nflat, smooth ridge, in fine condition for the seed. The wheels pass\r\nalong on the leveled ridge, making the dots, as shown in figure 2.\r\nHandles are fixed to the implement to enable the plowman to keep it in\r\nproper place, and for convenience in turning. One horse is fastened to\r\nthis implement, and two rows are prepared for planting at the same time.\r\nThis utensil would be troublesome to use in an orchard, or on stumpy\r\nground. Peanuts, however, should always be planted on open ground clear\r\nof all impediments. Instead of the knocker and dotter combined, many\r\nplanters omit the wheels, and make a separate implement with one wheel\r\nand a handle, to work by hand, as represented in figure 3. This can be\r\nrun among trees and stumps. It resembles a wheelbarrow without the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--THE DOTTER.]\r\n\r\nHands--women, children, or men, follow the dotter, dropping a seed in\r\neach mark or depression, and carefully covering it with the foot, by\r\npressing enough soil into the hole to just fill it. The holes are made\r\none and a half to two inches deep, and the hands are cautioned not to\r\nget the seed covered deeper than that. One inch is deep enough to plant,\r\nif the soil is moist, but if quite dry the seed may be put deeper.\r\nProceeding in this way, covering first with one foot and then with the\r\nother, the planters get on quite rapidly, although the hills are so near\r\ntogether. The planting is not at all tedious after one gets the knack of\r\nit, and is light and pleasant work. Some planters put two kernels\r\ninstead of one in each hill, to insure a stand, but this practice\r\nincreases the cost considerably, and is by no means general. After the\r\nseeds are planted they are very slightly, if at all, above the common\r\nlevel. In a week or ten days from the time of planting, the seeds will\r\nbegin to heave or crack the ground, which shows that the germ has\r\nstarted, and greatly relieves the anxiety of the planter. Then, by\r\ncounting the number of signs in a hundred hills, the farmer readily\r\ncalculates what kind of a stand he will probably have.\r\n\r\n=Fertilizers.=--We have already intimated that a calcareous soil is\r\nindispensable to successful Peanut culture. If the soil is not\r\ncalcareous by nature, it must be made so artificially. Hence the proper\r\nfertilizer to use is one that contains a large per cent. of lime in some\r\nof its forms, as the carbonate, the phosphate, the nitrate, or the\r\nsulphate, or the chloride of calcium. Recently, the sulphate of lime\r\n(gypsum), has been employed, even on limed or marled land, and its use\r\nhas been attended with good results. Animal and nitrogenous manures are\r\nnot suited to the crop. Such fertilizers produce a heavy growth of\r\nvines, but there will be no full, solid pods unless lime in some form is\r\nalso present. Marl has been found to be the one specific fertilizer for\r\nthe Peanut plant--better than any other form of lime; and the chief\r\nelement of value in marl has been shown to be the carbonate of lime.\r\nSome Virginia marls contain as high as seventy-five or eighty per cent.\r\nof the carbonate, and all of them range over twenty-five or thirty per\r\ncent. Now, marl is plentiful and cheap all along the Atlantic seaboard,\r\nfrom New Jersey to Florida, the beds lying side by side of, and\r\nintersecting, the very land that is the best adapted to the Peanut--a\r\nrare and fortunate coincidence, that planters are learning to fully\r\nappreciate. And were it not that the New Jersey land-owner finds it more\r\nprofitable to raise fruits and vegetables for the two great cities that\r\nlie on either hand of him, even he would find the Peanut to be a paying\r\ncrop. With his warm, light sand and green marl, he could easily raise\r\nthem. I mention this as one of the possibilities of the Peanut, though\r\nnot likely to be realized for the reason named.\r\n\r\n=Replanting.=--In about two weeks from planting, if the weather has been\r\nmild, the young plants should be large enough to show where replanting\r\nis necessary. The planter goes along the row, making slight depressions\r\nwith his heel at all the missing hills, drops a pea therein, and covers\r\nit with the foot, the same way as at the first. Instead of making\r\ndepressions with the heel, some use a long stake, an inch or two in\r\ndiameter, to the lower end of which is affixed a piece of plank,\r\nfastened two inches from the end, and four or five inches long (fig. 4).\r\nThis is used for punching the holes, and the piece of plank near the end\r\nprevents it from making the impression too deep. This is another of the\r\ninventions of the Virginia Peanut-planter; so true is it that \"necessity\r\nis the mother of invention,\" a new crop calls for new devices for its\r\nsuccessful and profitable cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--STAKE.]\r\n\r\nIn replanting, it is well to put two or more kernels to the hill, as the\r\nseason will be getting late, and no time should be lost in securing a\r\ngood stand. There can be no subsequent replanting with any profit.\r\n\r\n=Moles and other Depredators.=--The Peanut-planter has to contend with\r\nmany enemies. In many cases moles are exceedingly destructive to the\r\nplanted seed, burrowing along the rows, and eating the seed, hill by\r\nhill. Often raccoons, foxes, and squirrels grabble them up. And\r\neverywhere the larger birds, such as crows, doves, and partridges come\r\nin for a share of the seed, and annoy and hinder the farmer very much.\r\nThere is no remedy but ceaseless vigilance. The planter must go armed at\r\nevery turn to protect his crop. Sometimes planters tar the seed to\r\nprevent the moles, etc., from destroying them. It perhaps has some\r\ntendency to check the depredations, but does not prevent them entirely.\r\nCoal tar is oftenest used for the purpose, a half pint being enough to\r\nsmear a bushel of seed. The seeds are afterwards rolled in dry earth to\r\nprevent adhesion and trouble in planting. Traps, guns, and scarecrows\r\nare resorted to with varying success, but if the depredators are\r\nnumerous, the planter is generally the vanquished party.\r\n\r\n=The Critical Period.=--The first four or five weeks after the planting\r\nof this crop is its most critical period, and nothing but a good stand\r\nand the approach of warm weather will relieve the planter of his\r\nanxiety. At the first, many fears are reasonably entertained that the\r\nseed will not germinate well. And even should a pretty fair per-centage\r\nof the seed come up, cold and rainy weather may still seriously retard\r\nthe growth of the plants, or the numerous depredators that have been\r\nnamed may so far reduce the number of hills as to greatly curtail the\r\nyield per acre. The very young Peanut is among the tenderest of plants,\r\nand a very slight mishap will serve to destroy or permanently injure it.\r\nSeveral days of cold weather at this period will make the struggling\r\nplants look pale and sickly, and if warm suns are too long delayed, many\r\nplants will fail altogether.\r\n\r\nBackward springs are a great drawback in the cultivation of this crop,\r\nand cause many farmers to delay planting until it is certain warm\r\nweather cannot be many days off. If the planter could always be sure of\r\nhis seed, this would be the better plan, but if these late plantings\r\nfail to come up well, the season is too far advanced for replanted seed\r\nto make a crop. Further north than Virginia, however, it would, we\r\nthink, be decidedly better to put off planting until both soil and air\r\nare warm enough to insure quick germination, and then, instead of\r\nreplanting the missing hills with Peanuts, plant beans or field peas\r\ninstead. If the planter can get through the first month successfully, he\r\nlays aside his fears, and enters upon his work with renewed hope and\r\nenergy. To a recital of this work--the work of cultivation, we now\r\ninvite the reader's attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n=First Plowing and Weeding.=--Usually, the cultivation of the Peanut\r\nbegins by first siding the rows with a turn-plow, small mould-board\r\nattached, by which the soil is thrown from the plants, and lapped into a\r\nsmall ridge in the middle of the balk. Care is taken to run the plow\r\nquite near to the plants, so as to leave as little as possible for the\r\nhoe to do. The hoes follow the plow, removing the grass between the\r\nhills, if any, and loosening the soil about the plants. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, in case the plants begin to get quite grassy very early in the\r\nseason, the sides of the ridges are first scraped off with the hoe, the\r\noperator moving backward, and clearing off one side at a time. This\r\nremoves the grass pretty well, but does not loosen the soil about the\r\nplants. If this method is pursued, the plow should be put on in a week\r\nfrom that time, to break the hard crust that will have been formed, and\r\nto let in the air and heat to the roots of the plants.\r\n\r\nIf the first plan is followed, the missing hills may be replanted, if\r\nthe former replanting has had time to come up, but otherwise the ground\r\nabout the missing hills should not be disturbed. This, however, should\r\ndepend upon the time at which the weeding begins. If very late, it is\r\nuseless to replant.\r\n\r\nThe time for the first weeding must depend somewhat on the nature of the\r\nsoil and the quantity of grass that may have sprung up since planting.\r\nUsually the first working should begin by the time the plants are two\r\nweeks old, but if the land is mellow and there is but little grass, the\r\nwork may be put off a week longer. But if rains have occurred and a\r\ncrust has formed, and especially if grass is coming on rapidly, the\r\nplanter should not wait for the plants to attain a certain age and size,\r\nbut should proceed to work the crop as soon as the plants are clearly\r\nout of the ground, and have put forth one or two branches. Any practical\r\nfarmer who knows how to plow and weed young corn, will not be likely to\r\nerr very far in working a crop of peanuts. The operation is simple\r\nenough, the two points being to clear away the grass and make the soil\r\nfine and loose around the plants. Any plan of working that will secure\r\nthese ends, will accomplish the purpose.\r\n\r\n=Subsequent Workings.=--The second plowing may be done with a\r\ncultivator, running twice in the row. This will level the ridge in the\r\nmiddle of the balk, make the soil loose and fine, and bring the loose\r\nearth up close to the plants, which will make easy and nice work for the\r\nhands with the hoes unless there is a great deal of grass. The second\r\nplowing and weeding is the most important working the crop receives, and\r\nit is highly important that it be done well. By this time (last of\r\nJune), the days are long and hot, the grass everywhere is growing apace,\r\nand the Peanut must be kept growing too. The plants have now attained a\r\nsize ranging from that of a saucer to that of a breakfast plate, and\r\nthere will be some hand-picking of grass necessary, because some of it\r\nwill be found growing too near the plants to be cut away with the hoe.\r\nIf there is very little grass, the work goes on smoothly enough, the\r\nhoes proceed quite rapidly, three hands keeping up with one plow, and\r\nfinishing about two acres a day.\r\n\r\nThe third plowing may be given with a shovel or cotton-plow, or with the\r\ncultivator, again running twice in the row. The hoes need not follow at\r\nthis plowing, but may wait until the fourth plowing, done usually toward\r\nthe middle or last of July, or about the time the vines are a foot in\r\ndiameter, and are sending down their peduncles, or stems, on which the\r\nyoung pods are forming. The plants begin to blossom by the first of July\r\nor before, and continue to flower for more than a month. The pods begin\r\nto form very soon after the flower appears, and by the time of the last\r\nweeding great care must be taken not to cut the stems. For this reason\r\nthe hoes cannot proceed as fast as at the last weeding, and if there is\r\nmuch grass growing up through the vines to be hand picked, this working\r\nis tedious and laborious enough, and tires to the utmost the patience\r\nand endurance of the laborer. In fact, this is the worst period in the\r\ncultivation of the peanut crop. The weather is hot, close, and\r\nenervating; the frequent stooping and picking makes it doubly laborious;\r\nand, on account of the size the vines have attained, the plow must\r\nnecessarily leave a wider surface for the hoe to go over. All this makes\r\ngreatly against the hoe hands.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder, then, that, with laborers, many of whom are disposed to\r\nshirk their duty, the last working is too often poorly and inefficiently\r\ndone. With more reliable labor, such as is to be had in the Northern and\r\nborder States, better success would be easily attainable.\r\n\r\nThe third weeding is the last working with the hoe that the crop\r\nreceives, and next to the last usually given it with the plow. The\r\nVirginia planter, as a rule, stops weeding by the first of August, or as\r\nsoon as the vines have well met along the row, and have sent down a\r\ngoodly number of young pods. If there is any subsequent removal of\r\ngrass, it is done by picking it out by hand, in order not to interfere\r\nwith the pod stems. But after the last weeding, say in a week or ten\r\ndays, one more plowing is usually given, generally with the cultivator\r\nor shovel-plow, run once in the row. This throws the soil up under the\r\nextremities of the vines, leaving the row of plants on a nice flat bed\r\nand a water furrow in the middle of the balk.\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe that the cultivation required for the Peanut is\r\nsuch as will keep the soil mellow and loose on the surface and clear of\r\ngrass, especially about the vines or plants. Any method of weeding and\r\nplowing that will secure these ends, will serve the purpose.\r\nAccordingly, there is a considerable diversity of practice in this\r\nparticular, both as to the mode of plowing, times of working the crop,\r\nand implements used. The cultivation, however, is as easy and simple as\r\nthat commonly bestowed on Indian corn or beans, but must be a little\r\nmore thorough and painstaking. That is all. None need shrink from\r\nplanting this crop through any apprehension that they will not work it\r\nproperly. The three essential points are: keep the soil loose, the grass\r\ndown, and do no harm to the young pods as they are forming on the vine.\r\n\r\n=Implements.=--This topic has been, in a measure, anticipated, allusion\r\nhaving already been made to the implements to be used in the cultivation\r\nof this crop. A few additional remarks, however, may not be out of\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe weeders should be armed with the best steel hoes, with factory-made\r\nhelves of ash, light and slightly flexible. The superiority of this\r\nhoe--usually called the \"goose-neck hoe\" in Virginia--over the old style\r\nof weeding hoe, with the heavy and stiff home-made helve, cannot be\r\nestimated, except by those who have tried both. The same hand can\r\nperform an eighth more labor in a day with the light steel hoe, and do\r\nit better, and with more ease to himself. The \"goose-neck\" will last two\r\nor three seasons, costs but little more than the other kind, comes ready\r\nfor work, and is, therefore, very cheap. The blades should be kept sharp\r\nby repeated filing.\r\n\r\nWith us the first plowing is generally done with the turn-plow, with a\r\nsmall mould-board attached, throwing the earth into the balk. For the\r\nsecond plowing, the cultivator or cotton-plow, is used, either one of\r\nwhich does fine work on smooth land, and makes it quite easy for the hoe\r\nhands. The third plowing is commonly performed with the cultivator, but\r\nif the ground is rough, the turn-plow will answer better. It is not\r\ncommon, however, to plant peanuts on very rough ground. For the fourth\r\nand fifth plowings the cultivator or shovel-plow is used. But should the\r\ncrop get very grassy, (which should never be permitted), the turn-plow,\r\nwith large mould-board attached, is used, in order to cover up as much\r\nof the grass as possible. This makes a large and objectionable ridge in\r\nthe balk, but it is the best way to conquer the grass when it gets too\r\nstrong a hold. The hoes follow the plow, and scrape off the remaining\r\ngrass, except that near the plants, into the balk. Bunches of grass that\r\nhave grown up among the vines have to be pulled out by hand. Thus, it\r\nwill be seen that there is no plow made especially for cultivating the\r\npeanut crop, the same plows and implements that are used for other and\r\ngeneral farming purposes answering equally well for the cultivation of\r\nthis crop also.\r\n\r\n=When Cultivation should Cease.=--When the peanut vines have interlocked\r\nconsiderably along the rows, and have almost, or quite met across the\r\nbalks, it is high time to cease cultivating them. When the vines are\r\nlarge, the cultivator or plow will tear and bruise them more or less,\r\nsometimes breaking off large branches, and, of course, destroying a\r\nnumber of pods. If there is not room for the plow to pass without\r\npulling out the young peanuts and harming the vines, it should be taken\r\noff the field and the crop left to take care of itself. So long as the\r\nvines remain small, the crop may be worked to some extent, provided\r\nalways that care be taken not to molest the stems that have penetrated\r\nthe soil. Every one of these that is harmed now is a peanut lost. In\r\nVirginia, two months--June and July--covers the period of cultivation\r\nfor the peanut crop, and it cannot be extended much beyond this time\r\nwithout some risk. In fact, a crop that has been faithfully worked\r\nduring this time will not require anything more, and any extra labor is\r\nas good as thrown away.\r\n\r\n=Insect Enemies.=--Fortunately for the planter of peanuts, there is\r\nscarcely an insect that does them any material harm. At least, such has\r\nbeen the case, so far, in Virginia. What subsequent years may bring, is,\r\nof course, unknown. But up to the present, no insect has ever caused any\r\nextensive injury to this crop. It is true that ants do sometimes destroy\r\na few hills on certain soils, by sucking the cotyledons of the plant\r\nbefore it has attained any considerable size and strength. But this is,\r\nby no means, general. Even the voracious and ubiquitous Colorado Beetle\r\nmanifests no taste for this plant, although it has had abundant\r\nopportunity to test its edible qualities. To the credit of insects\r\ngenerally, be it said, they are not omnivorous.\r\n\r\n=Effects of Cold.=--The effect of severe and prolonged cold on the\r\nPeanut plant in the early part of the season, is often quite manifest.\r\nCool nights and cold rains are much dreaded, they cause the plants to\r\nturn yellow and look sickly. The vines make little or no growth, the\r\nleaves become spotted and curled, as if they had been touched by fire,\r\nand the whole plant gets into that unthrifty looking state denominated,\r\nin the local parlance of the planter, \"the pouts.\" But let a few days of\r\nwarm sun occur, and all is speedily changed. The plants assume a fresh\r\nand lively green, and their growth is now rapid until they reach\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\n=Effects of Drouth.=--A very dry spring would cause the Peanut to come\r\nup badly, and would, therefore, seriously affect the crop. Such an\r\noccurrence, however, is very rare in Virginia, as well as in the country\r\ngenerally, and is not regarded with much apprehension. If the plant is\r\nonce well established in the soil, being tap-rooted, it can stand a good\r\ndeal of dry weather. It takes a long period of extremely dry weather to\r\nmaterially injure this crop. Such a season did occur in 1883, and the\r\nconsequence was a great many blasted pods and a short crop. Generally,\r\nmoderately dry summers are looked upon with favor by the planter,\r\ninasmuch as seasons of this kind enable him to keep the crop clean of\r\ngrass at much less cost. Just here we would repeat what we said in\r\nChapter II, in relation to deep plowing preparatory to planting. With a\r\nsoil deeply broken in the outset, the Peanut will withstand successfully\r\nany period of dry weather ever likely to occur in this country. It has\r\nbeen noticed that the crops that suffer the most from drouths are those\r\nplanted on land not well prepared, or in orchards of growing trees,\r\nwhich necessarily extract a great deal of moisture from the soil. Even\r\nin a season as severe as that of 1883, peanuts planted on a deep, mellow\r\nsoil out of the reach of trees, did well, and were well seeded and\r\nfilled. Deep preparation of the soil, then, is a corrective of drouth\r\nfor this crop, as well as for any other. With this simple precaution, no\r\ngreat apprehension need be entertained of the effects of dry weather.\r\nLet the planter but do his part in preparation and cultivation, and\r\nnature will be sure to respond with liberal, if not overflowing crops.\r\nThe corn-planter has more to fear from dry weather than the\r\npeanut-planter.\r\n\r\n=Appearance at this Period.=--The appearance of a thrifty crop of\r\npeanuts at the time of maturity, or a little after the last weeding, is\r\nsimply magnificent. The vines have now met in both directions, and the\r\nwhole field, from a little distance, looks as if covered with a carpet\r\nof velvet-plush. Nothing obstructs the view. The vines lie close on the\r\nsoil, and the eye reaches every nook and corner of the field, and takes\r\nin the whole panorama at one glance. Few other crops afford so clear or\r\nso pleasing a prospect. Indian corn, in the tender green of summer, is a\r\nbeautiful object to look upon, but it shuts out all view of distant\r\nparts of the farm. The golden wheat, as it bends to the passing breeze,\r\nis also beautiful, but one must go around it and not through it. A field\r\nof cotton, as the open bolls display the snowy lint, is a sight to\r\nplease the admirer of nature, but it lacks the setting of green that is\r\nalways pleasing to the eye. The peanut crop surpasses them all in\r\nbeauty. It presents an air of freedom, of repose, of life, and of\r\nsecurity from harm, of which no other can boast.\r\n\r\nSuch is the crop to which we have invited the reader's attention, and\r\nthe planting and cultivation of which we have endeavored to describe.\r\nHaving proceeded thus far, let us pause a moment, as the writer has\r\ndone, time and again, to survey the beautiful prospect of a field of\r\npeanuts in full maturity. There it is, a literal carpet of living green,\r\ncovering acres on acres of mother earth, and beneath its velvet folds is\r\nquietly growing the wealth that is to make its owner independent, and by\r\nmeans of which the planter's family is to secure most of the necessaries\r\nand comforts of life. No crop outside of the market gardens, yields so\r\nmuch actual cash per acre as this. No wonder, then, that it readily\r\nbecomes popular with all who try it, and that it never loses ground\r\nwherever introduced under favorable circumstances.\r\n\r\nAn interval of about two months now elapses, during which the crop\r\nrequires no attention. The seed pods are filling and maturing, and the\r\nwhole plant is ripening for the harvest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nHARVESTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n=When to begin Harvesting.=--We come now to the laborious and often\r\ndifficult work of harvesting the peanut crop. We say difficult, for\r\noften rainy or other unpropitious weather at this period, makes it\r\nexceedingly hard to save the crop in good condition, and prevent the\r\npods from becoming dark or spotted. Ordinarily, the harvesting should\r\nnot begin so long as mild and growing weather continues, even though\r\nOctober may be far spent. It is important, of course, to get as many\r\nfirm, matured pods on a vine as possible, and the longer the weather\r\nholds favorable for this, the more pods, as a rule, will there be.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the crop has been planted early, and the leaves begin to\r\nfall from the vines, it is better to start the plow and dig the crop at\r\nonce. When the Peanut plant gets fully matured, it is very apt to begin\r\nto cast its leaves, especially on ground that has been planted in\r\npeanuts often before. After the leaves fall off, the vines are of very\r\nlittle value as hay, and as most planters consider them excellent\r\nprovender, they make it a point to harvest the crop in time to secure\r\ngood hay. For the same reason, effort is made to dig and shock the vines\r\nbefore a killing frost occurs. Frost spoils the vines for fodder, though\r\nit does no harm to the pods, unless it be for seed. Some suppose that\r\nseed taken from frost-bitten vines will not come up well.\r\n\r\nIn the latitude of Virginia the usual time for digging the peanut crop\r\nis the second and third weeks in October. That is, the great bulk of the\r\ncrop is dug about this time, though some start the first week in that\r\nmonth, and others wait until the close, unless driven to start earlier\r\nby the weather. In rare cases, some planters dig by the twenty-fifth of\r\nSeptember, but it is generally believed that all who start thus early\r\nlose more in weight and yield than they gain in time or price. Six or\r\nten days of mild weather at this stage of the crop, will make an\r\nappreciable difference in the yield, and if the peanuts can remain in\r\nthe ground until the latter part of October, there will be very few\r\nsaps, or immature pods. But, in whatever latitude the planter may\r\nreside, the general rule should be, to dig before a killing frost\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\n=Mode of Harvesting.=--In Virginia, the general practice is as follows:\r\nFirst, plow the peanuts with a point having a long, narrow wing, and a\r\nsmall mould-board, so that the vines will be loosened without having any\r\nearth thrown upon them. The plow passes along on both sides of the rows,\r\njust near enough for the wing to fairly reach the tap-root, which it\r\nsevers. Care is taken to put the plow deep enough to pass under the pods\r\nwithout severing them from the vines. This is important, as most of the\r\ndetached pods are lost, and if the work is slovenly done, the loss will\r\nbe great.\r\n\r\nHands with pitchforks follow the plow, lift the vines from the loose\r\nsoil, shake them well to get the earth off, and then lay them down,\r\neither singly or in small piles, to remain a day or two to wilt and cure\r\nin the sun. This is light work, and can be done rapidly, two hands being\r\nenough to keep up with one plow. If rain is feared, it is best to lay\r\nthe vines down singly after shaking them, for, when in piles, if rain\r\noccurs, and the weather is warm, the pods are apt to speck and mildew\r\nbefore the vines can dry out. A rain falling on the pods after they are\r\ndug, and before they are shocked, does no harm, if the sun comes out\r\nsoon to dry them before they can mildew.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--SHOCK STANDING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--SHOCK REMOVED.]\r\n\r\nInstead of leaving the vines on the ground a day or two to cure, many\r\nshock them up at once. If the vines are perfectly dry, this is as good a\r\nplan as any. But if the weather should be warm, and the vines are wet\r\nwith dew or rain when put up, they will be sure to heat, and the pods\r\nwill turn dark. In cold weather the vines may be shocked both green and\r\nwet without risk.\r\n\r\nThe method of shocking the Peanuts will be understood from figure 5,\r\nwhich represents a shock as it stands in the field. A shock as it is\r\ntaken down for picking is shown in figure 6. The vines are first laid\r\ntogether in piles, about as much as one can handily carry on the fork at\r\none time, three rows being put in one. The stakes, which have been\r\npreviously prepared, are then set in the ground proper distances apart,\r\nand two billets of wood, four or five inches in diameter and two feet\r\nlong, are placed beside each stake to keep the vines off the ground. A\r\nhandful of vines is then laid, pods up, on one side of the stake for a\r\nbed, and the same on the other side. After this the vines are put on,\r\npods down. The first are inverted to keep the pods off the ground,\r\nthough this is a matter of trifling importance, if the billets of wood\r\nare large enough. The successive handfuls of vines are laid up with\r\ncare, keeping the shock level, lapping the vines, and placing them on\r\nevery side to make the work even. As the work progresses the vines may\r\nbe pressed down with the hands, and the shocks are finished off round at\r\ntop, the better to shed the water. No cap or covering for the shocks is\r\nused, though much would frequently be saved, could a cheap one be had. A\r\nboard nailed on the top of the stakes would protect the top layer very\r\nmuch, and yet the planter who should adopt it would doubtless be laughed\r\nat.\r\n\r\nA fast hand can put up fifty or sixty shocks a day, with a boy to bring\r\nup the vines and assist in planting the stakes. Some shockers use the\r\nfork to lay up the vines, especially toward the top. The shocks are put\r\nup one in a place wherever needed, so as to make the work convenient for\r\nthe carrier. Some, however, put three or more shocks together, as suits\r\ntheir fancy, in which case fence rails are usually employed to build\r\nthe shocks upon.\r\n\r\nThe above method is generally practised, but there are many variations\r\nin almost every detail. We have endeavored to give a clear idea of a\r\nsafe method.\r\n\r\n=Why Cured in the Field.=--Perhaps some reader unacquainted with the\r\ncultivation of the Peanut, may ask: Why all this trouble to shock and\r\ncure the crop in the field? Why not pick the pods from the vines as soon\r\nas they are dug, and cure the peanuts on scaffolds, or elsewhere, and\r\ncure the vines on the ground, like hay?\r\n\r\nWe answer, because the pods cure better in the shock than in any other\r\nway. They get dry sooner, and make heavier and brighter peanuts than\r\ncould possibly be the case, were they gathered at once, and spread, even\r\nin very thin layers, on scaffolds to dry. Besides, as rain on the pods\r\nwhen they are about half cured, or during the process of curing, would\r\nbe very harmful, it is found best to protect the pods by covering them\r\nin shock. They can get more air in shock than if spread on a scaffold,\r\nand a free circulation of air about them is important. A scaffold close\r\nenough to hold the pods would exclude the air in every direction, except\r\nfrom above. When shocks are put up well, the pods are very effectually\r\nprotected, except a few on the top, and in about ten days are cured nice\r\nand bright, and ready to be picked off. The shocks may remain in the\r\nfield many weeks, subject to repeated rains, without material injury. Of\r\ncourse rains of several days continuance would damage the peanuts more\r\nor less. It is best therefore, on this account, and because of the\r\nnumerous depredators that prey upon the crop while it remains in the\r\nfield, to house it as soon as sufficiently cured to render it certain\r\nthe pods will not heat and spoil when in bulk.\r\n\r\n=Depredators.=--The creatures of the animal kingdom that levy their tax\r\non the unwilling planter, and come in for a share--and often a large\r\nshare--of the peanut crop, are of many kinds, and numerous in all. Of\r\nquadrupeds, the deer, fox, raccoon, squirrel, and sometimes even the\r\ndog, are more or less destructive; the raccoon, squirrel, and fox are\r\nparticularly so, beginning their inroads early in the fall by scratching\r\nup the immature pods, and continuing their thefts daily and nightly as\r\nlong as any remain in the field. In some localities, these animals are\r\nexceedingly annoying, and occasion great loss unless their depredations\r\ncan be checked.\r\n\r\nNext to the animals named, birds are most destructive, while the peanuts\r\nare in shock. Such birds as the blue-jay, crow, partridge, yellow\r\nhammer, wild turkey, and blackbird, coming, as some of them do, not\r\nsingly, but in companies and flocks of hundreds and thousands at a time,\r\ncarry off vast quantities, unless the planter is always on the alert,\r\ngun in hand, ready to meet them at every turn. Near the James, and other\r\nlarge rivers, it is a common occurrence to see, not thousands only, but\r\ntens of thousands of blackbirds in a single field at one time. They\r\noften go in flocks covering acres on acres of ground, and with their\r\nceaseless activity and endless trilling, present an appearance of which\r\ncity-bred people can form no adequate idea. Of course they destroy a\r\nvast amount of peanuts in a short time, unless speedily driven off.\r\n\r\nThere are also several species of field rats and mice, together with the\r\ndomestic rats and mice that get into the shocks to feed on the pods,\r\nwhere they remain until disturbed by the pickers. Everything seems fond\r\nof the Peanut after it is made, and if the planter escapes the insect\r\nenemies in the summer, the exemption is more than offset by the numerous\r\nand voracious depredators of the fall and winter.\r\n\r\nAnd against most of them, there is no effective remedy, the planter\r\ncannot watch his crop all the time, and traps are hardly worth using. It\r\nis true, something may be done with steel traps for such animals as the\r\nfox, raccoon, and squirrel. But for the rest, despatch in removing the\r\ncrop from the field, is the only certain preventive. Even then the\r\nplanter does not entirely escape, for rats and mice follow him within\r\ndoors, and riot in luxurious living so long as a single shock remains\r\nundisturbed. Perhaps no crop the Southern farmer grows is subject to\r\nheavier or oftener repeated losses than the Peanut. Yet, despite it all,\r\nit is a crop that often pays very handsome returns. It has been, and is,\r\nthe sheet anchor of many an East Virginia farmer, and if prices hold up,\r\nwill continue to be, so long as there are lands here that will produce\r\nthirty bushels of peanuts to the acre. This is but the minimum; the\r\nmaximum is not known; a hundred and thirty bushels per acre has been\r\nattained.\r\n\r\n=Detached Peanuts.=--In the process of digging and shocking peanuts,\r\nmany pods must necessarily become detached from the vines. Some of\r\nthese remain in the soil, out of sight, and numbers more are scattered\r\nover the ground, from one side of the field to the other. If the vines\r\nare fully matured, and have changed color or shed their leaves, and\r\nespecially if frost has touched them, the pods come off much more freely\r\nthan if the vines are still green, or scarcely done growing. Generally,\r\nthe detached pods are the best of the crop, being those first matured,\r\nand which are therefore solid and heavy.\r\n\r\nOf course these peanuts must not be lost. Women and children are\r\nemployed to pick them up at so much per bushel. If it is found that many\r\npods remain in the ground, a cultivator or light plow is run along the\r\nrows to bring them in sight. In this way the most of the loose peanuts\r\nare saved. Still, numbers will be left in the ground. The planter is at\r\nno loss, however, to secure these also, which he does by turning his\r\nfattening hogs on the ground as soon as he can remove the crop from the\r\nfield. Hogs are exceedingly fond of the Peanut, and as soon as they find\r\nthem out, they will continue to root for them as long as one can be had.\r\nFrequently, every square yard of large fields, will be burrowed over by\r\nthe hogs in their search for the detached peanuts. No crop the planter\r\ngrows will fatten a hog so quickly as the Peanut. Thus in the harvesting\r\nof this beautiful and profitable crop, nothing is allowed to be lost.\r\n\r\n=Saving Seed Peanuts.=--It now remains to say something of the method of\r\nsaving seed peanuts. Every step in this process must have in view one\r\nprincipal point--keeping the pods from becoming the least heated, either\r\nin shock or in bulk. Perfect and continued ventilation must be secured.\r\nThe vines should not be shocked while green, nor the pods kept in large\r\nbulk after being picked off. Neither should the vines be touched by\r\nfrost, either before or after being dug.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to dig and shake the vines as usual, and leave them in\r\nthe field four or five days, or a week, before they are either piled or\r\nshocked. In this time, if the weather is fair, the vines will be so\r\nnearly cured that not enough moisture will remain in them to create a\r\nheat, even in very warm weather, and they may then be shocked with\r\nperfect safety, after which they should remain in the field until\r\nthoroughly dry. Rain falling on the vines while they are lying in the\r\nfield, does no harm, except it be to turn the pods a little dark, which\r\ncircumstance makes no difference with seed peanuts.\r\n\r\nWhen the seeds are picked off, keep them in baskets until ready to\r\nspread them in a cool, dry room, where they will be exposed to a free\r\ncirculation of air. In no case should they be in bulk. Spread them\r\nthinly in some loft, where the air will reach them, and where they will\r\nbe secure from rats and mice. They may be stored in sacks the same as\r\nfor sale, and laid in an airy room to remain all winter. They should not\r\nbe kept in a room where there is a stove, or one subject to currents of\r\nhot air.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions embody all that need be done to secure good seed. If\r\npeanuts are fully cured when picked off, and are not kept too close,\r\nthey will prove good seed, unless there is some radical defect of the\r\ngerm or vital powers. Keep them from heating, and they will germinate\r\nand grow as readily as corn. Every planter may, and should, save his own\r\nseed. According to the number of acres that he thinks of planting, let\r\nhim provide two bushels of seed (or forty-four pounds in the hull), for\r\neach acre, and he will have enough and some to spare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMARKETING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt requires as much judgment to market a crop well, as it does to raise\r\nand harvest it, and often more. Unfortunately, the majority of planters\r\nare sadly deficient in that knowledge of commercial life, which would\r\nmake them masters of the situation. Too often they are bound by lien or\r\nmortgage, or else they have run up a heavy bill at the country store,\r\nand when the crop is made and ready for market, they are obliged to sell\r\nforthwith. Generally too, this is the very time when prices are lowest,\r\nand so the planter is obliged to part with the fruits of his labor at\r\nthe most unfavorable rates, and allow the middlemen to pocket the\r\nprofits. It is only by careful economy and prudent management, on the\r\npart of each planter for himself, that this evil is to be corrected.\r\nWithout entering into the details of commercial affairs, we will\r\nendeavor to show the planter how he may go into market with his crop,\r\nprepared to command the best prices. To this end, it is essential that\r\nhe have his crop in the best marketable condition, remembering that a\r\ngood article always sells well.\r\n\r\n=Picking off the Peanuts.=--This part of the work, usually done by women\r\nand children, may make or spoil the sale of the entire crop. If stems\r\nare gathered with the pods, and good, bad, and indifferent are all\r\nlumped together, with leaves and trash thrown in for good measure, a\r\ngreat deal of assorting and cleaning will subsequently be required, or\r\nelse the sale of the crop will be impaired to the extent of one or two\r\ncents to the pound. In picking, the stems should be rejected, and the\r\nsaps and inferior pods, if gathered at all, be kept apart from the rest.\r\nOnly the best, brightest, and soundest pods should go into the A, No.\r\n1's, and these, if clean of earth and trash, will always bring top\r\nprices. The saps also will sell, at lower rates. It is the neglect of\r\nthese few precautions that so sadly curtails the bill of sale of many a\r\nplanter. If planters would offer pickers extra inducements for clean\r\npods, this difficulty would, to a great extent, be obviated. When the\r\nsame price is paid for all, without regard to the manner of picking, a\r\npremium is offered for slovenly work, and the careless get better paid\r\nthan the painstaking.\r\n\r\nIn picking, the pops should be refused altogether, and the saps and very\r\ndark pods go by themselves. Many planters, however, leave the saps on\r\nthe vines, saving the best only. The saps, however, will sell, either in\r\npod or shelled, and if numerous, will more than pay for picking them. It\r\nis, therefore, so much gained. It must be confessed, however, that the\r\npresence of a good many saps on the vines, makes them much more valuable\r\nas feed.\r\n\r\nJust here let us explain that \"pops\" are pods that have attained full\r\nsize and firmness, but which are minus the seed. Dry weather, and the\r\nlack of calcareous manures in the soil, will cause many pops. \"Saps\" are\r\nimmature pods, the last to form on the vine, and which might become good\r\npeanuts if they could have a longer period of growing weather. The\r\npresence of pops in the marketable peanuts is very detrimental to their\r\nsale, and hence should be carefully rejected in picking. Saps also are\r\ndetrimental, but to a less extent than pops.\r\n\r\n=Price paid Pickers.=--The price paid pickers varies somewhat from one\r\nseason to another, according to the quality of the peanuts, and the\r\nmarket price received for them. Hands commonly board themselves, and\r\nreceive so much per bushel for picking. Of late years, the price has\r\nstood pretty uniformly, at twelve to fifteen cents per bushel. The\r\npeanuts are either measured or weighed. If weighed, twenty-four pounds\r\nare counted as a bushel in the first part of the season, the extra two\r\npounds being taken to make up for the subsequent loss in weight. If a\r\nhand is boarded by the owner of the crop, he gets but ten cents a bushel\r\nfor picking. A fast hand will pick from four to six bushels a day, the\r\nchildren are just as likely to do this as grown people. Hence, at this\r\nseason of the year, women and children earn what is considered pretty\r\nfair wages. Under the most favorable circumstances, the best hands will\r\npick seven bushels a day. Very much depends, however, on the quality of\r\nthe peanuts, and something also on the weather. In very dry weather, the\r\nstems come off with the pod, and pickers cannot do as well.\r\n\r\n=Cleaning and Bagging.=--After the peanuts are picked off, they should\r\nbe cleaned, before being sacked. The object of this, of course, is to\r\nrid them of the earth that may still be adhering to them. It makes the\r\nhull look cleaner, and brighter also, and thus enhances the sale.\r\nFormerly, the planter made his own cleaning machine, but recently, since\r\nthe starting of what are called \"Peanut factories,\" the planter very\r\nseldom runs his peanuts through any machine at all, but sells them just\r\nas they are picked. Being thus rid of much trouble and labor, it is\r\ndoubtful whether it would now pay the planter to clean his peanuts, as\r\nhe once did. The price paid for them now, is almost as much as he would\r\nrealize, were he to take ever so much pains in cleaning them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--VIRGINIA PEANUT CLEANING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nBut as the reader in other parts of the country, may desire to know\r\nsomething of the mode of cleaning peanuts at home, we give a description\r\nof the Virginia machine for this purpose. There is no patent on this\r\nmachine, and any one may make it for himself. A cylinder (figure 7), as\r\nlarge as a flour barrel; is formed by nailing narrow slats of plank, to\r\ntwo circular pieces of timber. The slats are put a little way apart, but\r\nnot far enough for the pods to slip through when the cylinder is turned.\r\nA piece of timber runs lengthwise, through the centre of the cylinder,\r\nthe ends of this project about a foot, and serve as an axle on which to\r\nturn it. A crank is attached to one end or both ends of the axle. Two\r\npieces of scantling are fastened together in the shape of an X, one for\r\neach end, and these are held upright by having pieces nailed on\r\nhorizontally, from one to the other. Several slats on the cylinder are\r\nfastened together to make a door, and this is attached to the cylinder\r\nby hinges, and fastened with a button.\r\n\r\nThe peanuts are poured into the cylinder, two or three bushels at a\r\ntime, and it is made to revolve slowly, until all the earth and litter\r\nhas fallen out. The door is then opened, the peanuts turned out and\r\nbagged.\r\n\r\nIn bagging the peanuts, care should be taken to have the sacks well\r\nfilled. They are estimated to hold four bushels each, and if properly\r\nfilled, good solid peanuts will over-run a little, especially in the\r\nfirst part of the season, before they are thoroughly cured. As the sacks\r\nare being sewed up, the corners must be packed with peanuts as long as\r\nany more can be got in. For sewing up the sacks, the planter needs a\r\nlarge peanut-sack needle and twine made purposely for this business.\r\nSacks cost the farmer, at the present, ten cents each, and generally the\r\npeanuts are sold by gross weight and nothing paid for the sacks. In some\r\nmarkets the sacks are paid for, and a pound deducted from the gross\r\nweight, for each sack. If the planter sells to a merchant near home, he\r\nseldom sews up the sacks, but ties them, and they are emptied and\r\nreturned to him at the store.\r\n\r\n=Peanut \"Factories.\"=--It does not fall within our present plan to\r\ndescribe these establishments, any further than to give the reader,\r\noutside of the peanut belts, an idea of them. Formerly, many peanuts\r\nwere sent into market without being properly assorted and cleaned, and\r\nit was found that, by assorting and re-cleaning them, a little margin of\r\nprofit was left after paying expenses. One step led to another, and\r\nvarious appliances and machines were brought into requisition, until\r\nnow, large buildings are devoted solely to the purpose of cleaning,\r\nassorting, and storing the peanuts. Some of these establishments employ\r\nmany hands, both male and female, to clean, separate, and re-bag the\r\npeanuts ready for the trade.\r\n\r\nThus it has happened, that the business of cleaning peanuts has been\r\ntaken out of the hands of the farmer, reduced to a system, and made a\r\nnew industry. In fact, a division of labor; and now the merchant buys\r\nthe peanuts of the planter just as they are picked, and the \"factories,\"\r\nso-called, clean and assort them for the large buyers. Still, the\r\nmerchant will pay more for Peanuts in nice order, and perhaps it would\r\neven now pay the farmer to properly clean and assort his crop before\r\nselling it.\r\n\r\n=The Best Markets.=--A few years ago, the city of Norfolk was the sole\r\nmarket for the Virginia and North Carolina planter, and New York for the\r\nwholesale dealer. Later on, Wilmington, Petersburg, Richmond, and\r\nseveral of the smaller towns began to buy peanuts, until now, every\r\nvillage and trading centre throughout the whole peanut belt, has become\r\nthe repository for the crop of its own immediate section. Every year,\r\nthe market has been coming nearer and nearer to the planter, until now\r\nhe finds it about as profitable to sell to the nearest country merchant,\r\nas to ship to town, and sometimes more so. Frequently, the country\r\nmerchant becomes the agent of some large buyer, who furnishes the\r\ncapital, and he buys all the peanuts he can, at figures very near the\r\nruling market price. Of course, this works very much to the planter's\r\nbenefit. He sees his crop weighed, he escapes the middleman, with all\r\nthe attendant expenses, such as commissions, freight, etc., he sells for\r\ncash, and he does not have to wait several weeks for returns.\r\n\r\nUnder this state of affairs, the home market, or home buyer, becomes the\r\nbest for the farmer. And with the constantly increasing demand, and\r\nclose competition between buyers, the cleaning factories are also coming\r\nnearer the farmer, and already exist, or will soon exist, in each of the\r\ncounties and sections where the Peanut is much grown. Thus the planters\r\ngenerally, will soon be enabled to sell directly to the cleaners, and\r\nthe latter to the wholesale buyers. So the planter will get market\r\nprices, without the trouble of going to market. Perhaps the competition\r\nwill eventually grow sharper still, until, not only will the peanuts be\r\ncleaned and bought at home, but will also be manufactured into oil,\r\nflour, and the other commercial forms, in the sections where they are\r\ngrown. In everything, the tendency now is, to carry the factories to\r\nthe raw material, and not the latter to the factories. It is not to be\r\npresumed that this crop will prove an exception.\r\n\r\nThus it is, that the farmer's work is being narrowed down, by the\r\ninevitable and beneficial law of the division of labor. The planter may\r\nnow turn his attention wholly to the cultivation of the crop. How to\r\norder it, so as to realize the largest possible yield from the smallest\r\npossible areas, is now the problem before him. He finds given to his\r\nhands, a great and growing staple with great, and still unknown,\r\npossibilities, and he sees the demand becoming larger and more earnest,\r\nuntil now, the buyer comes to his very door, and puts down the ready\r\ncash for all of this crop that he has to sell.\r\n\r\nOf course the planter must, and will bestir himself, to meet the\r\never-increasing demand. To do this with profit to himself, he must study\r\nthis crop from beginning to end, he must learn the nature of the Peanut\r\nplant fully and correctly, and discovering how to increase the yield per\r\nacre to its maximum, unravel the secret of how to grow it at the least\r\ncost per bushel.\r\n\r\n=Picking Machines.=--It may be well here to allude to a question, which,\r\ndoubtless, the thoughtful reader has already asked himself, namely: Why\r\ndoes not some one invent a machine for picking peanuts rapidly, instead\r\nof having to do it by the slow and tedious process of hand-picking? In\r\nreply we state, that numerous attempts to do so have been made, but with\r\nvery indifferent success. None of the many picking machines, that have\r\nhitherto been offered, have given satisfaction. It seems that they\r\ncannot be made to do the work, and most planters appear to have given up\r\nlooking for any help in this direction. Very recently, the writer has\r\nheard of one picking machine that is said to be giving satisfaction, but\r\nhe has not seen it, or conversed with any one who has done so. That an\r\nefficient machine of this kind is an impossibility, is not believed, but\r\nwhether anything can be made that would pay better than the old method,\r\nis the question. The planter must await developments. Perhaps some\r\ningenious mechanic will take up the problem, and give the planter a\r\nperfect and cheap picking machine. Here is a field for ingenuity. A good\r\nmachine would be a profitable invention. Who will try?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving now traced the Peanut plant through the whole process of its\r\nplanting, cultivation, harvesting, and marketing, the practical part of\r\nour task is ended. If the directions are such as will enable the\r\nbeginner in this branch of rural industry, to successfully cultivate and\r\nmanage this crop, the end will have been attained, and this little book\r\nwill not have been written in vain. It has been prepared for those\r\nhaving no practical acquaintance with the cultivation of the peanut\r\ncrop, not for the old and experienced planter. And yet, without egotism,\r\nit is believed that even the latter may find something in it that will\r\nbe of use to him. Practices vary in different sections, even among men\r\nof the same calling, and inasmuch as methods herein detailed, will be\r\nfound to vary from those practiced in North Carolina, Tennessee,\r\nGeorgia, or the far South, so will the planter in those States who may\r\nchance to read this treatise, be enabled to compare our methods with\r\nhis, to see wherein they differ, and perchance may find here some point\r\nor plan a little better than his own.\r\n\r\nIt only remains now to give, in another chapter, some of the many uses\r\nof the Peanut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the more important uses of the Peanut and its plant are here\r\ngiven. In the course of time, as new discoveries are made, it is not\r\nimprobable that the Peanut may subserve other valuable ends. But if no\r\nmore uses than are now known, are ever found for any part of this plant,\r\nit will continue to occupy an important position among the agricultural\r\nproductions of the country. Its importance will increase year by year,\r\nits value being too well understood and appreciated for it ever to lose\r\nits place among our leading crops.\r\n\r\n=Peanut Oil.=--The use that gives the Peanut especial value as an\r\nAmerican crop, is the place it occupies as an oil-producing plant. The\r\noil of the Peanut is regarded as equal in all respects to sweet or olive\r\noil, and may be employed for every purpose to which that is applied.\r\nThis gives it at once a commanding position, and were no other use found\r\nfor the plant, this would give it great importance among the economic\r\nproductions of our country. Olive oil is largely consumed for culinary\r\nuses, in medicine, and in the arts. Except in California, the olive has\r\nnever been planted upon a commercial scale in this country, and it is\r\nvery important that we possess a plant, that will obviate our dependence\r\nupon foreign oil. Of course, it is not within our scope to describe the\r\nmanufacture of Peanut oil. The farmer is satisfied with knowing that his\r\ncrops are in demand, and need not trouble himself about the methods by\r\nwhich they are converted into this or that useful commodity.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that a bushel of peanuts (twenty-two pounds in the hull)\r\nsubjected to the hydraulic press, will yield one gallon of oil. The\r\nyield by cold pressure, is from forty to fifty per cent. of the shelled\r\nkernels, though if heat be used, a larger quantity of oil, but of\r\ninferior quality, is obtained. The best Peanut oil is nearly colorless,\r\nwith a faint, agreeable odor, and a bland taste, resembling that of\r\nolive oil. It is more limpid than olive oil, and becomes thick when\r\nexposed to a temperature a few degrees below the freezing point of\r\nwater. Peanut oil is not one of the drying oils. During the late war it\r\nwas extensively employed in the Southern machine shops, and regarded as\r\nsuperior in its lubricating qualities to whale oil. For burning it is\r\nhighly esteemed. The chief consumption of the oil is in making soap. For\r\nthe production of oil for soap making, there were imported into\r\nMarseilles, France, from the West Coast of Africa, in one year, peanuts\r\nto the value of over five millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe residuum, or oil cake, may be sold for cattle feed.\r\n\r\n=Roasted Peanuts.=--Almost every person residing in the eastern section\r\nof our country, must necessarily know something of the value of roasted\r\npeanuts. One cannot pass along the streets of any of our larger cities\r\nand towns, without encountering, at every turn, the little peanut\r\nstands, where roasted peanuts are sold by the pint. They are kept for\r\nsale in numerous shops, they are peddled on the railroad cars, and sold\r\nto the loungers at every depot. Roasted peanuts are more common than\r\nroasted chestnuts once were, and almost everybody eats them. Even the\r\nladies are fond of them, and frequently have them at their parties.\r\n\r\nIt is safe then to say, that everybody likes them, and finds them\r\npalatable, healthful, and fattening. From a pig to a school boy, no diet\r\nwill fatten sooner than roasted peanuts. A person can live on them alone\r\nfor an indefinite period, if eaten regularly and with moderation. The\r\nanalysis of the Peanut shows it to be rich in the albuminoids, or\r\nflesh-forming elements. Roasted peanuts, therefore, form a very useful\r\narticle of diet, and fill a place between the luxuries and the\r\nnecessaries of common life. Wherever they have been once introduced,\r\nthey cannot well be dispensed with; and as their use in this respect is\r\nconstantly extending, this purpose alone would serve to keep the product\r\nbefore the public as a salable article. Once let the Peanut find its way\r\nto the great cities of Europe, and roasted peanuts be sold upon the\r\nstreets there, as well as here, and the demand for them will far exceed\r\nthe present limits, and the cultivation be necessarily extended over a\r\nmuch wider area than now. There is every reason to believe that the\r\ndemand for the crop will continue to increase.\r\n\r\n=Peanut Candy.=--This is another of the purposes to which the Peanut has\r\nbeen applied, and serves to illustrate how varied and numerous are the\r\nuses of this remarkable production. Flat bars of sugar candy are stuck\r\nfull of the broken kernels of the roasted nuts. It is quite good, and\r\nforms a pleasing addition to other kinds of confectionery.\r\n\r\n=Peanut Coffee.=--Here again the Peanut fills a useful end, especially\r\nin times of scarcity, or high prices for coffee. Taken alone, and\r\nwithout any addition whatever of the pure berry, the Peanut makes a\r\nquite good and palatable beverage. It closely resembles chocolate in\r\nflavor, is milder and less stimulating than pure coffee, and\r\nconsiderably cheaper than Rio or Java. If mixed, half and half, with\r\npure coffee before parching, and roasted and ground together, the same\r\nquantity will go as far and make about as good a beverage as the pure\r\narticle, and a better one than much of the ground and adulterated coffee\r\noffered in the market. Indeed, if people will adulterate their coffee,\r\nit were much to be wished that they would use nothing more harmful than\r\nthe Peanut for this purpose.\r\n\r\nFor making the beverage, the Peanut is parched and ground the same as\r\ncoffee, the mode of decoction the same, and it is taken with cream and\r\nsugar, like the pure article.\r\n\r\n=Peanut Chocolate.=--True chocolate is made by roasting and grinding to\r\na paste, by the aid of heat, a very oily seed, the Cocoa-bean. In the\r\npreparation of chocolate a great variety of articles are used to\r\nadulterate it and diminish its cost. Some of these, such as sugar and\r\nstarchy substances, are harmless, while others, such as mineral coloring\r\nmatters are injurious. Peanuts are largely used to adulterate chocolate,\r\nand so far as wholesomeness is concerned, are not objectionable. In\r\ncontaining a great deal of starch and oil, peanuts resemble the\r\ncocoa-bean, though without the nitrogenous principle, _theobromine_\r\n(which closely resembles _caffeine_), to which its nutritive qualities\r\nare largely due. Peanut chocolate is made in some Southern families by\r\nbeating the properly roasted nuts in a mortar with sugar, and flavoring\r\nwith cinnamon or vanilla as may be desired. Peanut chocolate, on so high\r\nan authority as the author, the late William Gilmore Simms, is vastly\r\nsuperior to peanut coffee.\r\n\r\n=Peanut Bread.=--If peanuts are first mashed or ground into a pulp, and\r\nthen worked into the dough in the process of kneading, no lard will be\r\nrequired to make good biscuit, and the bread will have an agreeable\r\nflavor, different from that imparted by lard, but of such a mild and\r\npleasant taste as to be entirely unlike the peanut flavor. The skin of\r\nthe kernel must first be removed, or it will impart a bitterish and\r\nnutty taste. There is some difficulty in doing this. Scalding does not\r\ndo it very well. Strong soda water or lye, will quickly loosen it, so\r\nthat it may be readily removed by rubbing with the hands, but either\r\nfluid would soon convert the Peanut into soap, and is, therefore,\r\nimpracticable for this purpose. Could some cheap and handy machine be\r\ninvented, that would remove the skin from the kernel without loss, no\r\ndoubt large quantities of peanuts would be used for bread-making\r\npurposes. Whether or not it would be economical, we cannot at present\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n=Peanut Soap.=--If a fair article of soap can be made of corn shucks, as\r\nwas done in the South during the late war, then there can be no doubt\r\nthat a better quality can be made from Peanuts. Surely a vegetable\r\nproduct containing such a large per-centage of oil, would be easily\r\nacted upon by lye. The writer has not experimented in this direction,\r\nbut we hear of some who have tried it, and who say they have made a good\r\nand serviceable soap from the kernels of the Peanut without the addition\r\nof other oil or grease. We have no doubt but very good soap may be made\r\nfrom the Peanut, but whether the manufacture of such an article would be\r\nprofitable at present prices, is another question. Perhaps for ordinary\r\nlaundry soap it would not, but for the higher grades of toilet soap it\r\nmight be. Here is a field for experiment, and yet we mention this use,\r\nas well as those of bread-making and coffee from the same article, as\r\none of the possibilities of this plant, rather than a result to be\r\nlooked for in the near future, if at all. It is well that manufacturers,\r\nand all others, should know what is capable of being done with this\r\npromising product. The more we can multiply the uses of any product of\r\nour farms, the wider will be the demand for it, and this is what the\r\nfarmers desire.\r\n\r\n=Peanuts as Feed for Stock.=--This is a use for the Peanut, about which\r\nwe can speak with confidence, and from experience. We now refer to the\r\npeanut pod, including, of course, the kernel, and not the vine or hay.\r\nEvery kind of stock, horses, cows, sheep, hogs, and poultry, are\r\nexceedingly fond of the Peanut, and will leave any other food to partake\r\nof it. Cows, horses, and sheep eat the whole pod, hull and kernel\r\ntogether. Hogs and poultry (except turkeys) reject the hull, eating the\r\nkernel only. Turkeys, as a rule, swallow the pod whole, and a real live\r\nturkey can hide away quite a quantity of the nuts in a short time, if\r\nallowed free access to them. In fact, all animals do not seem to know\r\nwhen they have enough of this food. All stock fattens readily on them.\r\nThe hog will lay on flesh faster on a diet of peanuts, than on corn,\r\npotatoes, or any other product with which the writer is acquainted. The\r\npoorest scrub of a hog, turned into a peanut field, after the crop is\r\nremoved, and where he can get nothing but the pods he may find by\r\nrooting for them, will change his appearance in three days, and in a\r\nweek, will be so much improved as hardly to be recognized as the same\r\nanimal. As a pork producer we believe that the Peanut has not its\r\nsuperior in any clime or country. It is a thorough fat-former. Poultry\r\nintended for laying should be sparingly fed with it.\r\n\r\nBut we would not leave this subject without a grain of caution. While\r\nall stock fattens rapidly on the Peanut, it must be confessed that the\r\nfat is not always of the best quality. It is less firm and more oily\r\nthan the fat derived from Indian corn, nor will the lard from hogs\r\nfattened upon peanuts show that pearly white and flaky appearance, which\r\nis the marked characteristic of pure lard made from corn. For this\r\nreason, most planters in the peanut belt, feed their peanut-fed hogs on\r\ncorn only for two or three weeks before killing them. This is done to\r\nmake the lard firm and white, and in this manner, good pork and lard are\r\nproduced at only a trifling cost. The hogs get nearly fat from the\r\ndetached peanuts left in the field, and which otherwise would be lost.\r\nIn this way the peanut-planter derives a very important benefit from\r\nthis crop, apart from its value as a source of ready money. Were there\r\nno other use for the peanut, it would still pay well to raise it for\r\nmaking pork. In this case, the planting and cultivation would be the\r\nsole cost, as the animals would do all the harvesting. A very small\r\nfield would fatten quite a number of hogs. Poultry intended for market,\r\nmight well be fed on Peanuts, instead of corn or oats. The fowls would\r\nfatten faster and at less cost. In fact, we believe it would be\r\neconomical to buy peanuts at ruling prices for fattening stock,\r\nespecially old stock.\r\n\r\n=Peanut Hay.=--If dug and cured before frost touches them, and before\r\nthe leaves fall to any great extent, peanut vines make a very good\r\nprovender for all stock. Some say it is better than blade fodder for\r\nhorses and mules, but we are not prepared to advance this extravagant\r\nclaim for it. It is, however, certainly an excellent article of fodder\r\nfor cattle, sheep, mules, and horses, and if many sap peanuts are left\r\non the vines, stock that is not worked much, will need no other feed\r\nduring the winter months to keep them in good condition.\r\n\r\nMost planters, accordingly, make it an object to try to save the vines\r\nfor hay, and aim to dig the crop before they are injured by frost.\r\nAfter a killing frost touches them, the vines are next to worthless as a\r\nfeed. In fact, frost-bitten peanut vines are harmful, rather than\r\nbeneficial, to stock, often causing colics, and endangering the life of\r\na valuable horse or mule. Peanut vines, even the best of them, unharmed\r\nby frost, should not be fed very largely to horses. There is always a\r\ngood deal of grit and dust upon them, and much of this taken into the\r\nstomach, cannot but be more or less harmful to the animals.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, despite these few drawbacks, peanut hay has proved to be a\r\nvaluable forage, and one that the peanut-planter could not well dispense\r\nwith, inasmuch as so many do not make enough of other forage to serve\r\nthem, and must, therefore, depend on the peanut crop to help them out.\r\nThus the planter is benefited in several ways through this crop. He gets\r\na valuable staple to sell, and one that always commands the ready cash,\r\nhe fattens his hogs on the pods left in the ground, and he secures a\r\nlarge amount of very good hay in the vines. Thus he is doubly benefited,\r\nand no matter how low the price of peanuts may be, the farmer does not,\r\nand cannot, ordinarily, lose much on the cultivation of this great crop.\r\nIf he does not risk too much on commercial fertilizers, which no planter\r\nof this crop ever should do, he runs little risk of suffering any\r\ncrushing loss thereon.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief but connected view of the Peanut crop from the time of\r\nplanting the seed, to its sale and manufacture. The views and practice\r\nhere advanced are all from original sources. We have not drawn upon any\r\nother writer for any part of this treatise. Indeed, save a few short\r\narticles scattered through the agricultural press of the past ten or\r\nfifteen years, we know of no source from whence material could be\r\nderived. So far as we are aware, this is the pioneer work in America on\r\nthe Peanut plant. This being the case, it must, of course, be quite\r\ndefective. We might easily have made it a larger book, and perhaps some\r\nfew years hence, when the field and subject shall have enlarged, it will\r\nbe found desirable to revise and enlarge this treatise. For the present,\r\nwe must be satisfied with smaller things, and remain content with a few\r\npractical directions rather than an elaborate work. Until that time, if\r\nit comes at all, we lay aside the pen, and turn our hands (as it has\r\nbeen our wont to do during the past few weeks) to actual labors in\r\nconnection with the Peanut plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was our design, at first, to present a somewhat full array of\r\nstatistics in relation to the Peanut. This, however, was soon found to\r\nbe impracticable. The more we studied the few data at hand, the more\r\nwere we convinced of their utter unreliability. The fact is, so far as\r\nthe writer is aware, there are no credible data of this crop existing.\r\nNo authoritative and systematic attempt to gather and compile the\r\nstatistics of the Peanut has ever been made, and until this is done we\r\nshall never know its full extent and value. The \"estimates\"--mere\r\nguesses--of certain mercantile houses and newspapers, to express the\r\nbulk of the crop are, beyond a doubt, far wide of the mark. The\r\nfollowing from a Georgia paper, is of this class:\r\n\r\n\"The goober[2] plays a more important part in commerce than might be\r\nsupposed. We are all aware of its value as a social factor--of its\r\ninfluence upon oratory, music, and the drama--but how few of us know\r\nthat one million nine hundred and seventy thousand bushels of this\r\nsavory nut were consumed in this country during the twelve months ending\r\non the thirtieth of September, 1883. These figures do not include the\r\nlocal consumption--say, for instance, in the rural districts of Georgia,\r\nwhere every substantial farmer has a patch of his own.\r\n\r\n\"The figures relating to the goober crop make a column in the various\r\nprices current, but Georgia is not credited with any part of the crop.\r\nIt seems that the goobers of commerce, so far as this country is\r\nconcerned, are raised in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. In\r\n1882, Virginia raised one million two hundred and fifty thousand\r\nbushels, Tennessee four hundred and sixty thousand, and North Carolina\r\none hundred and forty thousand, making a total of one million eight\r\nhundred and fifty thousand. The aggregate value of the crop amounted to\r\ntwo million dollars. It is estimated that the peanut crop of 1883 will\r\nbe at least two million bushels.\r\n\r\n\"We regret that Georgia has no place in these estimates. Goobers can be\r\nraised in this State as readily as in Virginia, and there is no reason\r\nwhy our farmers should not take advantage of the demand for them. The\r\nlittle patches for home use, could easily be increased to patches\r\ncalculated to yield a comfortable supply of pocket money. As Georgians\r\nare known as goober-grabblers, there is no reason why they should not be\r\nknown as goober-growers.\"\r\n\r\nStill, these estimates serve a certain important end, and give an\r\napproximate idea of the magnitude of the crop. It is safe to say that it\r\namounts to nearly three million bushels annually, and were all the\r\ninformation gathered that could be, it would doubtless be greater still.\r\nIt is high time that the corps of statistical reporters to the National\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, were required to give the data for this crop,\r\nas well as for others, and some of them of less magnitude and value.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[2] See remarks on the term goober, in note on page 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B.\r\n\r\nCOSTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the attentive reader has expressed surprise that so little has\r\nbeen said about the cost of planting, cultivating, and harvesting the\r\npeanut crop. This was because no estimate of costs that would suit one\r\nplace, would apply in another and a distant locality. There is no\r\nuniformity in this matter, hence it was deemed best to leave each reader\r\nto count the costs for himself, based on his knowledge of his own local\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C.\r\n\r\nTHE PEANUT GARDEN OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following article from the Suffolk, Va., \"Herald,\" gives a concise\r\nview of the growth and development of this staple in Virginia, and\r\nillustrates how a portion of the Southside has become, perhaps, the\r\nleading peanut-producing section of our country:\r\n\r\n\"When James H. Platt introduced his bill in Congress imposing a duty\r\nupon peanuts imported from Africa, a large majority of the members of\r\nthat august body hardly knew what a peanut was. A few of them had eaten\r\n'Goobers' which had been carefully cultivated in the garden by their\r\ngrandmothers, but as to why they needed protection, or how many of them\r\nthere were to protect, but little was known even by the best informed.\r\nThe culture of this important agricultural product was then in its\r\ninfancy, and it was hardly recognized as an article of commerce.\r\n\r\n\"Only a few short years have rolled by, and what a change has been\r\neffected. The peanut crop has assumed gigantic proportions, and the\r\naggregate amounts to millions of dollars, while the nut is in demand\r\nfrom one end of the Union to the other at satisfactory prices.\r\n\r\n\"The section of country contiguous to and lying south of James River,\r\nand between Norfolk and Petersburg, may be correctly termed the peanut\r\ngarden of the world.\r\n\r\n\"In this section peanut farming has been brought to the highest state of\r\nperfection, and the average production per acre greatly increased from\r\nwhat was considered a good yield a few years ago.\r\n\r\n\"The one great difficulty in handling the crop seems to be, in the fact\r\nthat no machine has yet been invented which will pick off the nuts from\r\nthe vines in a satisfactory manner. This work must be done by hand, and\r\nas the entire crop matures at one and the same time, there is such a\r\ndemand for labor during the picking off season that the supply is\r\nutterly inadequate to the demand. It is probable that within the next\r\nfew years some plan will be devised for the successful storage of peas\r\nand vines until they can be conveniently picked off; and when this\r\ndesirable end is accomplished, much of the rush and confusion incident\r\nto the gathering and marketing of the peanut crop will be avoided. This\r\nis already done by every thrifty planter who is able to hold his crop\r\nuntil such time as he sees fit to sell it. He stores his peanuts away,\r\nand picks them off, mostly with his own force, at convenient intervals\r\nthrough the winter and spring.\r\n\r\n\"While so much has been done in the way of improvements in the\r\nproduction of the Peanut, those who have done the handling after\r\nreaching market have not been idle. In former years, only the bright\r\nshell and those well-filled, could be sold in the market. A dark color\r\nor half-filled pods was sufficient cause for rejection, and frequently\r\nthey were on this account not even offered in market. Here, however,\r\nmachinery was more successful. Various mechanical contrivances have been\r\nput in operation for cleaning and assorting the nuts, and to-day every\r\ngrade of peanuts--from the large, plump, well-filled shell, to the\r\nsmallest, blackest, and most insignificant half-filled pod--has a\r\nregular standard market value, according to the weight per bushel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD BOOKS.\r\n\r\nCommended by the Greatest Educators of Germany, England and the United\r\nStates.

Illustrated. =$1.50=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\r\n    | Transcriber's Note:                           |\r\n    |                                               |\r\n    | Typographical errors corrected in the text:   |\r\n    |                                               |\r\n    | Page   7  privitive changed to privative      |\r\n    | Page  17  challanges changed to challenges    |\r\n    | Page  56  residum changed to residuum         |\r\n    | Page  64  poineer changed to pioneer          |\r\n    | Page  70  backneyed changed to hackneyed      |\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------+",
