F.\r\nMaury, The Physical Geography of the Sea, 1855.)_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe diagrammatic portrayal of the relief of continental land areas of\r\nthe world has been completed by both the late A. K. Lobeck and Erwin\r\nRaisz, whose magnificent diagrams are familiar to all geologists and\r\ngeographers. The authors of the present sheet are preparing a similar\r\nseries of marine physiographic diagrams.\r\n\r\n_The Physiographic Diagram: Atlantic Ocean; Sheet 1_ is the first of\r\nthis projected series. The Atlantic Ocean diagram will consist of five\r\nsheets at a scale of about 1:5 million. A diagram of the South Atlantic\r\nOcean at a scale of about 1:11 million now nearly completed will form\r\nthe first of a general series planned to portray the world oceans.\r\n\r\nIn addition, diagrams of selected areas well covered by sounding\r\nprofiles will be prepared at scales of about 1:2 million.\r\n\r\nEach sheet or series of sheets will be accompanied by descriptive notes\r\ntreating the nomenclature, morphological, geological, and geophysical\r\ncharacteristics of each of the physiographic provinces.\r\n\r\n_Lamont Geological Observatory Contribution 308_\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\n      _Physiographic Diagram: Atlantic Ocean, Sheet 1 (Plate 1)_\r\n\r\nCopies of the Physiographic Diagram: Atlantic Ocean, Sheet 1 are\r\navailable unfolded so that each will be suitable for wall mounting. The\r\ndiagram is therefore not physically inserted or attached to this volume\r\nalthough it forms the basic part of the paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe studies of submarine topography at the Lamont Geological\r\nObservatory have been supported by the United States Navy Bureau of\r\nShips under Contract NObsr 64547. The expeditions which obtained\r\ntopographic data were supported by the Office of Naval Research under\r\nContracts N6 onr 27124 and N6 onr 27113 and the Bureau of Ships under\r\nContract NObsr 64547. Three cruises were supported by the National\r\nGeographic Society, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and\r\nColumbia University. Financial support has been received from The\r\nGeological Society of America (Grant 635-54). The preparation of this\r\npaper was supported in part by the Bell Telephone Laboratories.\r\n\r\nThe studies that led to the present paper began at the Woods Hole\r\nOceanographic Institution just after World War II. With the founding of\r\nthe Lamont Geological Observatory in 1949 the work was transferred to\r\nthat observatory at Palisades, New York. Topographic data from Woods\r\nHole cruises were incorporated with Lamont data until 1953, when a\r\nseparate program was established at Woods Hole by J. B. Hersey, and\r\nColumbia University acquired the VEMA as its own research vessel.\r\nAlthough Woods Hole data obtained between 1953 and 1957 have not been\r\nused in preparing sheet 1, arrangements recently concluded provide for\r\nthe incorporation of past and future Woods Hole data in subsequent\r\nsheets of this series.\r\n\r\nThe soundings were read, compiled, and plotted by Morris Wirshup, the\r\nlate Andrew Nelson, Ivan Tolstoy, G. Leonard Johnson, III, the authors,\r\nand several others. The profiles were plotted by M. Wirshup, Hester\r\nHaring, the authors, and several others.\r\n\r\nThe soundings were taken primarily on board the Research Vessels VEMA\r\nand ATLANTIS (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution), but important\r\nsounding lines were obtained by the R/V ALBATROSS (Woods Hole\r\nOceanographic Institution), M/V THETA, and R/V CARYN (Woods Hole\r\nOceanographic Institution) and in the eastern Atlantic by the R.R.S.\r\nDISCOVERY (National Institute of Oceanography).\r\n\r\nThe following officers made outstanding contributions to the\r\nnavigational plotting: A. K. Lane, the late A. Karlson, J. Pike, R/V\r\nATLANTIS; D. Gould, the late F. S. Usher, D. Smith, V. Sinclair, H.\r\nKohler, and K. Simonson, R/V VEMA; and the late A. Nelson, R/V VEMA and\r\nM/V THETA.\r\n\r\nThe echo sounders have been installed, maintained, and improved by B.\r\nLuskin, H. R. Johnson, A. Roberts, M. Landisman, C. Hubbard, H. Van\r\nSantford, M. Langseth, G. Sutton, and many others.\r\n\r\nThe entire scientific party of each of the more than 50 expeditions\r\nrepresented in the data of this paper took turns marking and adjusting\r\nthe echo sounder, and all navigational officers on these expeditions\r\ntook the fixes and kept the logs. To these sea-going scientists and\r\nmariners too numerous to list the authors are extremely grateful.\r\n\r\nSoundings in the northeast Atlantic compiled by the British Admiralty\r\nHydrographic Department were kindly provided by Cmdr. J. S. N. Pryor of\r\nthat organization. Dr. M. N. Hill of Cambridge and Dr. G. E. R. Deacon\r\nof the (British) National Institute of Oceanography were instrumental\r\nin obtaining many of these valuable deep-sea soundings. Original\r\nsounding sheets of many areas were provided by the Coast and Geodetic\r\nSurvey through the courtesy of Admiral A. Karo and Mr. G. F. Jordan.\r\n\r\nB. Luskin's development of the Precision Depth Recorder and his\r\ncontinued research and development in echo-sounding equipment made it\r\npossible to obtain many of the detailed data of this paper.\r\n\r\nThe following expedition chief scientists conducted sounding surveys\r\nwhich have been incorporated in this paper: M. Ewing, J. L. Worzel,\r\nJ. E. Nafe, I. Tolstoy, R. S. Edwards, G. R. Hamilton, C. L. Drake,\r\nB. Luskin, W. C. Beckmann, F. Press, J. Northrop, J. Hirshman, M. J.\r\nDavidson, R. J. Menzies, F. C. Fuglister, E. T. Miller, and B. C.\r\nHeezen.\r\n\r\nThe writers are grateful to the great number of scientists who\r\nencouraged them in this work and especially to those who offered\r\nsuggestions and discussed the data and conclusions. We are particularly\r\nindebted to W. H. Bucher for discussions relative to tectonics, to\r\nDavid B. Ericson for problems relating to sediment distribution and\r\nanalysis, and to C. O'D. Iselin and C. H.

The diagram is based on continuous\r\necho-sounding traverses made by research vessels. The relief shown on\r\nthe profiles was sketched in perspective using the technique introduced\r\nby Lobeck. Between sounding profiles the relief is speculative, based\r\non extrapolation of trends noted in the profiles.\r\n\r\nThe area of the diagram is divided into three major physiographic\r\nregions which are in turn subdivided into the following categories of\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\n  CONTINENTAL MARGIN\r\n\r\n  _Category I_\r\n    Continental Shelf\r\n    Epicontinental Seas\r\n    Marginal Plateaus\r\n\r\n  _Category II_\r\n    Continental Slope\r\n    Marginal Escarpments\r\n    Landward Slopes of Trenches\r\n\r\n  _Category III_\r\n    Continental Rise\r\n    Marginal Trench-Outer Ridge Complex\r\n    Marginal Basin-Outer Ridge Complex\r\n\r\n  OCEAN BASIN FLOOR\r\n\r\n  _Abyssal Floor_\r\n    Abyssal Plains\r\n    Abyssal Hills\r\n    Abyssal Gaps and Mid-Ocean Canyons\r\n\r\n  _Oceanic Rises_\r\n\r\n  _Seamount Groups_\r\n\r\n  MID-OCEANIC RIDGE\r\n\r\n  _Crest Provinces_\r\n    Rift Valley\r\n    Rift Mountains\r\n    High Fractured Plateau\r\n\r\n  _Flank Provinces_\r\n    Upper Step\r\n    Middle Step\r\n    Lower Step\r\n\r\nEach province is defined, briefly described, and illustrated with\r\nprofiles and photographs of echo-sounding records.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of the physiographic provinces, defined solely by bottom\r\ntopography, show good correlation with variations in crustal structure\r\nas determined by seismic-refraction measurements and with anomalies of\r\nthe gravity and magnetic fields. In addition, the province boundaries\r\ncorrelate well with distribution patterns of bottom sediments. The\r\nphysiographic provinces are thus really morpho-tectonic provinces. The\r\nprecise correlation of topographic provinces and structure observed in\r\nspecific sections can thus be extrapolated along province boundaries to\r\ndeduce the geology in large areas where no geophysical work has been\r\ndone. The tectonic map of the Atlantic prepared in this manner will be\r\npresented in a subsequent publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART 1. PREPARATION OF THE PHYSIOGRAPHIC DIAGRAM\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral steps are involved in the preparation of a marine physiographic\r\ndiagram. The raw data consist of continuously recorded echograms and\r\nlists of positions of the research ship. Echograms are profiles of\r\nocean depth, automatically plotted against time (Luskin _et al._,\r\n1954). The first step is to read and tabulate the depth at each peak,\r\ntrough, or change of slope. These readings are plotted on a chart\r\n(1:1,000,000) as a series of closely spaced soundings. Depth profiles\r\nare plotted against distance at a standard vertical exaggeration of\r\n40:1. The sounding lines are also plotted on a chart of small scale\r\n(1:5,000,000) which is at the same scale as the final physiographic\r\ndiagram. The subsequent steps in the preparation of the diagram are\r\nillustrated by Figures 1_a-d_. The exaggerated profiles (1_b_) along\r\nthe tracks (1_a_) show a succession of peaks and valleys. These\r\nfeatures are sketched in along the tracks (1_c_). After all the\r\ntracks in a large area are sketched in this way, the major trends\r\nare estimated, and the diagram is completed by interpolation and\r\nextrapolation (Fig. 1_d_; Pl. 1). The vertical scale of the diagram is\r\n1 inch = 5000 fathoms which is an effective vertical exaggeration of 20\r\nto 1. The final diagram as printed is at a scale of 1:5 million at 40°\r\nN. on a Mercator projection.\r\n\r\nThere is a fundamental difference between the preparation of a\r\nterrestrial and a marine physiographic diagram. In the former the\r\nmajor problem is to select from more-detailed maps the features to\r\nbe represented. Except in unexplored, inaccessible areas, the shape\r\nof all land features is a matter of recorded fact; the problem is to\r\nabstract and artfully draw the features in question. In contrast, the\r\npreparation of a marine physiographic diagram requires the author to\r\npostulate the patterns and trends of the relief on the basis of cross\r\nsections and then to portray this interpretation in the diagram.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOGRAPHIC PROVINCE CHART: A study of the exaggerated profiles\r\nplotted during the preparation of the physiographic diagram revealed\r\nthe existence of morphological features and morphological provinces not\r\npreviously delineated. The limits of areas of contrasting morphology\r\nwere noted on the profiles, and these points were plotted on a chart of\r\nsmall scale (also about 1:5 million at 40° N.) (Pl. 20).\r\n\r\nCONTROL: Almost all the echo-sounding profiles used in the preparation\r\nof the physiographic diagram (Pl. 1) and the physiographic province\r\nchart (Pl. 20) were obtained by expeditions of the Lamont Geological\r\nObservatory and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (Pl. 21).\r\nSome soundings were provided by the Hydrographic Department, British\r\nAdmiralty (Pl. 21) and the International Hydrographic Bureau (Monaco).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 1.--_Method of preparation of physiographic\r\ndiagram_\r\n\r\n(a) Positions of sounding lines (A, B) are plotted on chart; (b)\r\nSoundings are plotted as profiles (A, B) at 40:1 vertical exaggeration;\r\n(c) Features shown on profiles (A, B) are sketched on chart along\r\ntracks; (d) After all available sounding profiles are sketched\r\nthe remaining unsounded areas are filled in by extrapolating and\r\ninterpolating trends observed in a succession of profiles.]\r\n\r\nThe echo soundings made by research vessels fall into three classes:\r\n(1) precision soundings (accuracy better than 1 fathom in 3000); (2)\r\nnonprecision soundings obtained by research vessels using commercial\r\necho sounders with control or close check on time standard; (3) poor to\r\nbad soundings made with commercial echo sounders without timing control\r\nor adequate checks. Most of the soundings used in this paper fall into\r\nthe first two categories. In Figure 2 the Precision Depth Recorder\r\n(PDR) sounding tracks are shown. In Figure 3 the good but nonprecision\r\ntracks are shown. The soundings of the third class are not shown. All\r\ntracks used in the preparation of the diagram are shown in Plate 21.\r\nMost of the sounding lines were located by standard dead-reckoning\r\nprocedures from astronomical fixes. Errors of a few miles are probably\r\ncommon. Position errors do not seriously affect the work described\r\nhere since we are dealing largely with texture read from profiles and\r\nplotted on a small-scale sheet.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the sounding tracks shown in the control chart, spot\r\ndepths shown on U. S. Hydrographic Office charts HO 0955a, 0955b,\r\n0956a, 0956b, and 5487 and on feuille A-1 of the Carte Générale\r\nBathymétrique des Océans (1935) were used where profiles were lacking.\r\nAlong the east coast of the United States the Coast and Geodetic\r\nSurvey soundings published by Veatch and Smith (1939) were used for\r\nthe continental shelf and slope. Other important sources of published\r\nsoundings include Hill (1956), De Andrade (1937), Dietrich (1939), Wüst\r\n(1940a), Emery (1950), and Tolstoy (1951).\r\n\r\nThe land areas of the diagram were sketched to the same rigid vertical\r\nscale as that used for the deep sea. Elevations for the United States\r\nwere taken from United States Geological Survey and Army Map Service\r\nquadrangle maps; elevations for Europe and Africa are from Bartholomew\r\nmaps; and elevations for the islands from United States Navy\r\nHydrographic Office charts.\r\n\r\nEXAGGERATED PROFILES: The profiles plotted at 40:1 vertical\r\nexaggeration are the basis for the topography sketched on the\r\nphysiographic diagram. A selection of these profiles is reproduced\r\nin Plates 22, 24, 25, and 27, and in Figure 45. All profiles from\r\nprecision soundings were originally plotted at a vertical scale of 2\r\ninches equals 1000 fathoms and a horizontal scale of 2 inches equals 40\r\nmiles. Nonprecision soundings were plotted at scales of 1 inch equals\r\n1000 fathoms and 1 inch equals 40 miles. In a typical area 40 to 60\r\nsoundings were plotted for each 60 miles of profile. The points were\r\nconnected and then qualitatively checked against the original echogram.\r\nAlthough all the larger features are represented on these profiles,\r\nfeatures of less than a mile in width may be missed. The small scale of\r\nthe physiographic diagram excluded the possibility of portraying most\r\nof the features less than 3-6 miles in width and less than 20 fathoms\r\nin height.\r\n\r\nDetailed study of the small-scale features less than 2 or 3 miles in\r\nwidth is best accomplished by a study of the original echograms. The\r\nPDR records are ideal for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 2.--_Precision depth recorder (PDR) sounding\r\nlines obtained by research vessels_\r\n\r\nMost of soundings shown were obtained by the Lamont Geological\r\nObservatory's R.

V. ATLANTIS, 1946-1953.]\r\n\r\nNORTH ATLANTIC SOUNDINGS: The study of the North Atlantic deep-sea\r\nbathymetry began a little more than a century ago with the taking of\r\nthe first deep-sea soundings by lead line. By 1860, largely because of\r\nthe great public interest in the proposed trans-Atlantic cables and the\r\nenthusiastic encouragement of Matthew F. Maury (1855), several hundred\r\nsoundings had been taken in the North Atlantic in depths greater\r\nthan 1000 fathoms. Meanwhile, on either side of the Atlantic surveys\r\nof coasts, harbors, offshore banks, and the continental shelf were\r\nbeing made for navigational use. The Hudson Submarine Channel and the\r\nhead of the Hudson Canyon were discovered by the United States Coast\r\nSurvey during this period. By 1912 more than 1800 deep-sea soundings\r\nhad been taken in the North Atlantic by the laborious method of using\r\na lead lowered at first by hemp line and later by wire. Between 1900\r\nand 1920 Fessenden in the United States, Behm in Germany, and Langevin\r\nand Florisson in France established that acoustic echo sounding was\r\npossible and built machines to take echo soundings. In 1922, echo\r\nsounding became a practical operation. Although many of the early echo\r\nsounders were fitted with automatic recorders, they were in general\r\nsuitable only for use in shallow water (less than 500 fathoms).\r\nDeep-sea echo soundings were obtained by listening on earphones for the\r\nreturning echo and timing the interval by eye with a suitable clock.\r\nThe improvement of sounding gear continued, and by the mid 1930's\r\nautomatic recording deep-sea echo sounders were manufactured and put\r\ninto limited use, although, by and large, all pre-World War II deep-sea\r\n(> 1000 fathoms) echo soundings were discrete observations by the\r\n\"ear and eye\" method. A good review of pre-World War II echo-sounding\r\napparatus is given in a publication of the International Hydrographic\r\nBureau (Anon., 1939). During the war the NMC[1] echo sounder was\r\ndeveloped and installed on many U. S. ships. It was adequate for\r\ndeep-sea sounding if in perfect condition; but the designers, being\r\ncautious, had arranged for recording only in the depth range of 0-2000\r\nfathoms. The NMC sounder on Atlantis was modified to record in greater\r\ndepths in 1945, and many thousands of miles of tracks were obtained\r\nof the deep sea with this apparatus. The NMC had a small record chart\r\n(6¼ inches = 2000 fathoms; ½ inch = about 3 miles). The precision was\r\nlow since the apparatus depended on a ship's regular AC power supply\r\nfor its time standard. A new sounder, the UQN-1B, was developed in the\r\nUnited States following World War II. The instrument as manufactured\r\nrecorded on an extremely small chart (8 inches = 6000 fathoms) but\r\ncould be modified for multiple 600-fathom scale recording (8 inches =\r\n600 fathoms). The timing function was usually accomplished by poorly\r\nregulated ship's AC power supply, and errors were consequently large\r\n(Dietz, 1954; Heezen, 1954). In addition, the stylus arrangement\r\nrequired constant adjustment. After only a few thousand miles were\r\nobtained by the Lamont Observatory expeditions it became obvious that\r\na new recorder incorporating precision timing and large recorder\r\npresentation was necessary for an adequate knowledge of topography.\r\n\r\n[1] U. S. Navy designation.\r\n\r\nBernard Luskin of the Lamont Geological Observatory, in co-operation\r\nwith the Times Facsimile Company, adapted the Times Facsimile receiver\r\nto do the timing and recording function of the echo sounder, using a\r\nstandard UQN receiver and transmitter (without recorder). More than\r\n200,000 miles of PDR soundings have now been obtained by expeditions of\r\nthe Lamont Geological Observatory. The apparatus originally described\r\nby Luskin _et al._ (1954) has been extensively improved (Luskin and\r\nIsrael, 1956). The Times Facsimile-Lamont PDR performs the timing\r\nand recording functions with an accuracy of better than 1 fathom in\r\n3000. This was a considerable improvement over older apparatus. The\r\nPDR generally uses multiple 400-fathom scales in which 400 fathoms is\r\nrepresented by 18¾ inches of record; the paper is carried through the\r\nmachines at 24 inches an hour. Other vertical scales (_i. e._, 200,\r\n800, 1200) can easily be provided, and the paper transport can be\r\nchanged by steps from 12 to 96 inches per hour. The laminated recording\r\npaper consists of two layers of light gray and a center layer of black.\r\nThe record is made by burning the upper gray layer and thus exposing\r\nthe underlying dark layer. The facsimile recording paper differs from\r\nthe conventional echo-sounder record paper in that a greater range\r\nof shades can be reproduced. Several PDR records are shown in the\r\nfollowing text (Pls. 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18).\r\nEffective study of the physiography of the deep-sea floor was made\r\npossible by introduction of the PDR. Echo soundings obtained by the\r\nEnglish in the area southwest of England have been used in the present\r\nstudy. The accuracy of their equipment has not been adequately treated\r\nin the literature, but it appears by comparison that most soundings are\r\naccurate to within at least 1 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART 2. PHYSIOGRAPHIC PROVINCES\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nDescriptions of physical features of the earth's surface are found in\r\nthe earliest-known writings. However, the systematic classification of\r\nland forms is relatively recent and followed the development of the\r\nscience of physical geology. The natural topographic divisions of the\r\ncontinents have been classified into physiographic provinces according\r\nto several similar systems (Lobeck, 1939; Fenneman, 1938; Atwood,\r\n1940; and others). These systems take into account form and age of the\r\nrelief, as well as the structure of the underlying rocks. Descriptions\r\nare usually given in terms of age, process, and structure, with the\r\nultimate aim the understanding of the origin and history of topography.\r\nDetailed topographic maps at 1:50,000 or larger are available and are\r\nused in conjunction with direct field observations. More recently\r\naerial photographs have greatly aided geomorphic studies.\r\n\r\nThe oceans, in contrast, have been subdivided by oceanographers merely\r\ninto basins separated by ridges and swells. This was done on the basis\r\nof widely spaced discrete soundings shown on charts rarely of larger\r\nscale than 1:10 million. The basins were delimited by arbitrarily\r\nchosen and often crudely controlled isobaths. The development and\r\ninstallation of continuously recording deep-sea echo sounders and their\r\nextensive use in the deep sea provide for the first time detailed\r\ntopographic information on the deep-sea floor and thus a new basis for\r\ndescription and classification.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps presumptuous at this time to refer to the topographic\r\ndivisions of the sea floor as physiographic provinces when we have\r\nonly scant information concerning the structure of each province, the\r\nage, the physical processes, and, in fact, the details of topography.\r\nTherefore, the classification described in the following pages is\r\npresented as a first attempt, with the full knowledge that it will be\r\nmodified and expanded by subsequent exploration.\r\n\r\nWe are only beginning to understand the structural significance of\r\ndeep-sea physiographic provinces. We now think that the correlation\r\nof topography and structure will be better under the sea than on land\r\nbecause of less vigorous erosion at depth in the sea. If this is true,\r\ndeep-sea structural patterns may eventually be quite simple to map.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOMENCLATURE AND CLASSIFICATION OF DEEP-SEA RELIEF\r\n\r\nBefore the advent of continuously recorded echo-sounding profiles, and\r\ntheir revelation of the texture of the sea-floor relief, classification\r\nand nomenclature of submarine topography were based on broad closed\r\nisobaths. We can characterize the older system as the bathymetric\r\nsystem of nomenclature in contrast to that employed in this paper,\r\nwhich we can call a geomorphic or textural system.\r\n\r\nThe terms \"basin\" and \"deep\" used in the older literature are usually\r\ndefined by closed 3000-, 4000-, or 5000-meter contours as represented\r\non the Carte Générale Bathymétrique des Océans (International\r\nHydrographic Bureau). For many purposes this terminology is useful,\r\nparticularly in describing the habitat of a deep-sea fish or the locale\r\nof a water mass. Consequently some such system should be retained even\r\nthough in many areas basin boundaries are difficult to define, and\r\nregardless of the fact that many boundaries cut arbitrarily through\r\nphysiographic provinces without regard for local province boundaries.\r\nThe Atlantic has been subdivided by Wüst (1940b) (Fig. 4) whose system\r\nis now in general use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 4.--_Major basins of the North Atlantic, after\r\nWüst (1940)_\r\n\r\nHeavy solid lines indicate boundary formed by axis of Mid-Atlantic\r\nRidge. Light solid lines indicate boundary formed by shelf breaks and\r\nsubmarine ridges. Dashed lines indicate arbitrary boundaries.]\r\n\r\nThe nomenclature of deep-sea topography has been considered by\r\nseveral committees during the past half century. The most recent\r\nrecommendations published by Wiseman and Ovey (1953; 1955) are followed\r\nwherever applicable. The older systems of nomenclature, however, are\r\nnot rigidly employed since we are dealing with textural provinces based\r\non profiles obtained with continuously recording echo sounders rather\r\nthan bathymetric provinces defined by closed isobaths.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITS OF DEPTH AND SLOPE\r\n\r\nOn the profiles and echograms the vertical scale is in units of\r\necho-sounding time rather than in units of true depth. In other words,\r\nall depths are calculated under the assumption that the vertical sound\r\nvelocity is 800 fathoms per second. Considering that the sound travels\r\nto the bottom and back, the calculation is based on 400 fathoms per\r\nsecond of lapsed time.\r\n\r\nSince the average vertical velocity is, within the area covered, always\r\nslightly less than 800 fathoms per second, the true depth is always\r\nslightly greater than the \"echo-time depth\" as expressed in \"nominal\r\nfathoms\". Figure 5 shows the range of corrections which must be\r\napplied in various parts of the area. The spot depths indicated on the\r\nphysiographic diagram are in units of true depth corrected according to\r\nMatthews' tables (1939) for regional variations in the average vertical\r\nsounding velocity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 5.--_Sound-velocity corrections for echo\r\nsoundings_\r\n\r\nAdd correction to uncorrected echo sounding to obtain true depth.\r\nCurves I and II are representative of North Atlantic 17°-50°N.\r\nexclusive of the Grand Banks region. Curves III and IV are\r\nrepresentative of the deep-water areas near the Grand Banks. Curves are\r\nbased on Matthews (1939) and are for use only where assumed sounding\r\nvelocity is 800 fathoms/second. _All soundings mentioned in the text\r\nare uncorrected for sound velocity._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 6.--_Conversion diagram for degrees, per cent\r\ngrade, feet per statute mile, and gradient_\r\n\r\n(a) Values of gradient from 1:10-1:1500; (b) Values of gradient from\r\n1:100-1:5000]\r\n\r\nThe inclination of the bottom is given as the tangent of the angle\r\nbetween the sloping plane and the horizontal expressed as a ratio of\r\nintegers. These ratios are referred to as gradients. In Figure 6 slope\r\nvalues expressed in degrees, per cent grade, feet per statute mile,\r\nand gradient are compared. With a few exceptions all profiles are\r\nrepresented with a 40:1 vertical exaggeration. To facilitate judging\r\nthe magnitude of slopes on these profiles, Figure 7 shows various\r\ngradient ratios at a 40:1 vertical exaggeration. Slope corrections\r\nhave not been made to the soundings. Except in special cases such\r\ncorrections would make insignificant changes in the 40:1 profile.\r\n\r\nAll distances are given in nautical or geographical miles (1 nautical\r\nmile = 6080 feet).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 7.--_Gradients from 1:5 to 1:8000 shown at a 40:1\r\nvertical exaggeration_\r\n\r\nMost profiles reproduced in this paper are at 40:1 vertical\r\nexaggeration.

The oceans can be divided into a few major\r\ndivisions which are in turn subdivided into categories of physiographic\r\nprovinces and then into individual provinces. The area of the present\r\nstudy is composed of the three major divisions shown in Figure 9:\r\ncontinental margin, ocean-basin floor, and mid-oceanic ridge. The\r\ndiscussion and description of the physiographic provinces of the North\r\nAtlantic will follow the schematic outline shown in Figure 8.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 9.--_Major morphologic divisions: North Atlantic\r\nOcean_\r\n\r\nThe profile is a representative profile from New England to the Sahara\r\nCoast.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINENTAL MARGIN\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND GENERAL CATEGORIES\r\n\r\nThe continental margin includes those provinces of the continents and\r\nof the oceans which are associated with the boundary between these two\r\nfirst-order features of the earth.\r\n\r\n_General categories._--In most areas three parallel categories of\r\nprovinces can be distinguished in the continental margin (Fig.\r\n10). The relatively flat portions of the submerged continental\r\nplatform constitute category I. These provinces are: continental\r\nshelf, epicontinental marginal seas (_e. g._, Gulf of Maine), and\r\ncontinental-margin plateaus (_e. g._, Blake Plateau). The provinces of\r\ncategory II include the continental slope, marginal escarpments (_e.\r\ng._, Blake Escarpment), and the landward slopes of trenches. These\r\nprovinces mark the edge of the continental block. Category III includes\r\nthe continental rise, marginal trench-outer ridge, and marginal\r\nbasin-outer ridge complexes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 10.--_Three categories of continental-margin\r\nprovinces_\r\n\r\nCategory I provinces lie on the continental block, Category II\r\nprovinces form the side of the continental block, and Category III\r\nprovinces are the upturned or depressed margins of the oceanic\r\ndepression.]\r\n\r\nThe most common type of continental margin is made up of continental\r\nshelf (I), continental slope (II), and continental rise (III). (Fig.\r\n10, Sahara and New York). In areas where the continental rise is\r\nwell developed it is composed of two parts, the upper and the lower\r\ncontinental rise (Fig. 15). In some areas the lower continental rise\r\nis replaced by an outer ridge, and the upper continental rise is\r\nreplaced by a marginal basin or marginal trench. These two latter\r\ntypes are illustrated in Figure 10 by profiles marked Blake Plateau\r\nand Puerto Rico respectively. Seamounts and islands occur in all the\r\ncontinental-margin provinces.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Category I provinces._--The ocean overflows its basin onto the edge of\r\nthe continents. The principal physiographic province of this submerged\r\nportion of the continental platform is the continental shelf which\r\nis present off all the lands of the world. The continental shelf is a\r\nsmooth area with very low relief and is nearly everywhere limited to\r\ndepths less than 250 fathoms. The continental blocks are also flooded\r\nby epicontinental seas. Some of these have rough bottoms, as the Gulf\r\nof Maine; others are relatively smooth-floored. Marginal plateaus,\r\nwhere present, lie in depths of 500-1200 fathoms, and many are nearly\r\nas smooth as the continental shelves.\r\n\r\nCONTINENTAL SHELF: The continental shelf is a shallow (averaging less\r\nthan 100 fathoms), gently sloping (less than 1:1000) surface of low\r\nlocal relief (less than 10 fathoms) which extends from the shore line\r\nto the shelf break where the seaward gradient sharply increases to\r\ngreater than 1:40. Its width ranges from a few miles to more than 200\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nContinental shelves border all land areas. Because of their proximity\r\nto shore, their shallow depth, and their importance in navigation the\r\ncontinental shelves are now the best-known part of the oceans (Veatch\r\nand Smith, 1939; Shepard, 1948).\r\n\r\nThe transition from the continental shelf to the continental slope is\r\ngenerally abrupt and is known as the shelf break. This feature ranges\r\nin depth from 20 to more than 100 fathoms and in form from a sharp edge\r\nto a rounded shoulder. The change in the gradient is from less than\r\n1:1000 to greater than 1:40.\r\n\r\nEPICONTINENTAL MARGINAL SEAS: The epicontinental marginal seas\r\nare those shallow seas (less than 1500 fathoms) which lie on the\r\ncontinental block and can be distinguished from the continental shelves\r\nby their greater depth (usually > 100 fathoms) and possibly greater\r\ntopographic irregularity. Most of them are enclosed by shallow banks (<\r\n50 fathoms) of the continental shelf and by land. The Gulf of Maine,\r\nthe Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the channels of the Bahamas belong to\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\nMARGINAL PLATEAUS: A marginal plateau is a shelflike feature which lies\r\nat greater depths than the continental shelf and is separated from the\r\ncontinental shelf by an incipient continental slope. These features\r\ngenerally lie at depths greater than 100 fathoms and less than 1200\r\nfathoms. They can be distinguished from epicontinental marginal seas\r\nby their lack of a seaward barrier or sill. The surface of a marginal\r\nplateau is generally quite similar to the continental shelf in slope\r\nand in the frequency and magnitude of minor relief features. The Blake\r\nPlateau is the only well-expressed representative of this morphologic\r\ntype in the area of the diagram. Well-developed marginal plateaus are\r\nalso found off the coast of southern Argentina and east of New Zealand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Category II provinces._--The steep slopes which border the continental\r\nblock are grouped into category II provinces. Loosely speaking, we are\r\nreferring to the continental slope but, because of the complications\r\nimposed by such features as marginal plateaus and marginal trenches, we\r\ndistinguish three province types.\r\n\r\nCONTINENTAL SLOPE: The continental slope is that relatively steep\r\n(3°-6°) portion of the sea floor which lies at the seaward border\r\nof the continental shelf. It typically drops from depths of 50-100\r\nfathoms to depths of 750-1750 fathoms. The top of the slope is\r\nusually well marked by a relatively sharp shelf break. The base of\r\nthe slope, although less definite, is generally abrupt. As a basis of\r\nclassification in those few areas where no abrupt change is noted, we\r\nhave set the gradient of 1:40 as the lowest gradient of the continental\r\nslope. The setting up of a lower limit for the gradient marks a\r\ndeparture from the older usage in which the continental slope was\r\ndefined as \"the slopes leading from the outer edge of the continental\r\nshelves down to the great depths of the ocean\" (Shepard, 1948). This\r\nolder definition included the continental rise, marginal plateaus,\r\nand marginal escarpments. The continental slopes are a world-wide\r\nphenomenon. The details of their regional distribution in the North\r\nAtlantic are covered in a later section.\r\n\r\nMARGINAL ESCARPMENTS: A marginal escarpment is a precipitous escarpment\r\nwhich forms the seaward slope of a marginal plateau. Such escarpments\r\nbegin in depths of 500-1500 fathoms and are 1000 to 2000 fathoms high.\r\nThe base of the escarpment is well marked by an abrupt change in slope.\r\nGradients of marginal escarpments exceed 1:10. The Blake Escarpment is\r\na marginal escarpment. Similar features are found in the Gulf of Mexico\r\nand off the southeast coast of Argentina.\r\n\r\nLANDWARD SLOPES OF TRENCHES: This term was introduced to set apart the\r\nlandward slopes of marginal trenches from the usual continental slopes\r\nfound off trench-less coasts. These steep slopes (> 1:40) drop from\r\ndepths of a few hundred fathoms near a continent to a depth of a few\r\nthousand fathoms in a marginal trench. In the North Atlantic the one\r\nexample is north of Puerto Rico. A large part of the circumference of\r\nthe Pacific is bounded by such features.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Category III provinces._--At the base of the continental slope a\r\ngentle gradient continues to the local level of the abyssal floor. This\r\nseaward gradient ranges from 1:100 to 1:700 and extends over a strip\r\nfrom a few miles to a few hundred miles in width. On many topographic\r\nprofiles made at right angles to the slope of the continental margin\r\nthree major breaks are visible: the shelf break, the base of the\r\ncontinental slope, and the point where the near-by level of the\r\nocean-basin floor intersects the more steeply sloping continental\r\nmargin. Since we have limited the continental slope to gradients\r\ngreater than 1:40, we split off this lower portion of the continental\r\nmargin into a separate province, the continental rise. In the older\r\n\"bathymetric\" classification of relief the ocean basin--continental\r\nslope boundary was along the 2000- or 2500-fathom contour, an arbitrary\r\ndivision which cut across the then-unrecognized continental rise. At\r\nthe base of the Blake Escarpment lies an enclosed basin, and north\r\nof Puerto Rico the sea floor drops almost directly to the floor of a\r\nmarginal trench. These seemingly diverse provinces of continental rise,\r\nmarginal escarpments, enclosed marginal basins, marginal trenches, and\r\nouter ridges are placed in category III because of their similarity in\r\nposition with respect to the continents and ocean floor and because of\r\nother similarities shown in the deeper structure of the continental\r\nrise.\r\n\r\nCONTINENTAL RISE: The continental rise, where present, lies at the base\r\nof the continental slope. Gradients on the continental rise generally\r\nrange from 1:100 to 1:700, while the width ranges from a few score to\r\na few hundred miles. However, gradients as high as 1:50 are observed\r\nin segment 3 of the upper continental rise, and gradients as low as\r\n1:2500 are locally present in segment 2 of the lower continental\r\nrise (Tables 1 and 2). The seaward limit of the continental rise is\r\ngenerally abrupt, and at this point regional gradients decrease to less\r\nthan 1:1000. The depth on the continental rise ranges from 750 to 2800\r\nfathoms. Local relief is moderate to low, and, except for infrequent\r\nseamounts and fairly frequent submarine canyons, the local relief of\r\nthe continental rise rarely exceeds 20 fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe continental rise is well developed over most of the area covered\r\nby the physiographic diagram. The major exceptions are north of the\r\nIberian Peninsula where the rise is present, but extremely narrow,\r\nand in the southwestern third of the map in the area south of Cape\r\nHatteras, where it is not present. In this latter area the geographical\r\nposition usually filled by the continental rise is occupied by the low,\r\nbroad outer ridge and the enclosed marginal basin and marginal trench.\r\n\r\nOUTER RIDGE: An outer ridge is a broad ridge generally more than 100\r\nmiles wide that rises from less than 100 fathoms to about 1000 fathoms\r\nabove the adjacent floor. It lies parallel to the continental margin\r\nand may enclose a basin or trench on the landward side. The local\r\nrelief of an outer ridge is generally a little greater than that of the\r\ncontinental rise but much more subdued than that on the oceanic rises\r\nand mid-oceanic ridges.\r\n\r\nMARGINAL BASIN: A marginal basin, where present, lies at the foot of\r\nthe continental slope or at the base of a marginal escarpment. It is\r\nslightly shallower than the general level of the ocean basins and is\r\nbounded on the seaward side by an outer ridge. Part of its floor is\r\ngenerally occupied by an abyssal plain.\r\n\r\nMARGINAL TRENCH: A marginal trench is a narrow, steep-sided feature\r\nrunning closely parallel to the trend of the continental margin; it\r\nis generally at least 1000 fathoms below the general level of the\r\nadjacent ocean floor. It is separated from the ocean floor by a low\r\nouter ridge which rises 100-500 fathoms above the level of the adjacent\r\nocean floor. The bottom of a trench is generally rugged except near the\r\ndeepest spots where it is flat.\r\n\r\nThe combination of marginal basin and outer ridge replaces the\r\ncontinental rise east of the Blake Plateau. North of Puerto Rico this\r\ncombination is replaced by a marginal trench-outer ridge complex. The\r\nreason for this grouping is discussed in a later section.\r\n\r\nSubmarine canyons cut across all the continental-margin provinces\r\nexcept isolated portions of the outer ridge. Submarine canyons range\r\nfrom less than a mile to more than 10 miles in width and from less\r\nthan 10 to nearly 1000 fathoms in depth. Canyons are most abundant on\r\nthe continental slope. However, a smaller number persist across the\r\ncontinental rise. They are also found on the marginal escarpments and\r\non the landward slopes of trenches. Shepard (1948), Kuenen (1950),\r\nVeatch and Smith (1939), De Andrade (1937), Johnson (1939), and others\r\nhave discussed the continental-slope canyons at great length. Canyons\r\nin the continental rise of the North Atlantic were discovered and\r\nmapped by Ericson, Ewing, and Heezen (1951).\r\n\r\n\r\nREGIONAL DESCRIPTION OF CONTINENTAL MARGIN\r\n\r\nThis discussion is based on continuously recorded echo-sounding\r\ntraverses made by Lamont Geological Observatory expeditions. Profiles\r\napproximately perpendicular to the continental margin are reproduced\r\nin Plates 24 and 25. None is precisely perpendicular, and thus slight\r\ndistortions of slopes and widths of the features are unavoidable.\r\n\r\nEASTERN NORTH AMERICA: Thirty-four profiles of the continental margin\r\nof eastern North America are presented in Plate 24. The positions of\r\nthe profiles are indicated on the index chart in Plate 23. All profiles\r\nshow the three categories of continental-margin provinces. Profiles W-1\r\nto W-21 Plate 24 show the more general succession of shelf, slope, and\r\nrise, while profiles W-22 to W-34 show the outer ridge-marginal basin\r\nand outer ridge-marginal trench complexes. Each of the 34 profiles\r\nexhibits a continental shelf although it may range from 20 to 300 miles\r\nin width. On each a shelf break is present at depths of 20-150 fathoms.\r\nEach profile shows a continental slope, the base of which may be from\r\n300 to 1900 fathoms deep.\r\n\r\nNorthern Grand Banks Sector.--On profiles W-1 to W-6 (Pl. 24), across\r\nthe Grand Banks of Newfoundland, the shelf ranges from 120 to 285 miles\r\nin width. Exceptionally strong local relief of 50-100 fathoms is found\r\non the shelf in profile W-1 northeastward from Newfoundland. The shelf\r\nbreak, which occurs at 150 fathoms, is abnormally deep--more than twice\r\nthe depths found off New England. The continental slope has a typical\r\ngradient of 1:20 but is unusually short as the continental rise is\r\nreached at 725 fathoms. From this depth the continental rise descends\r\nto the 1700-fathom curve at a gradient of 1:140. This gentle slope\r\nis interrupted by a group of exceptionally rugged lower continental\r\nrise hills which rise to 1250 fathoms. Northeast of the hills the\r\n2200-fathom line marks the rather abrupt beginning of the abyssal plain\r\nwhich slopes seaward at a gradient of 1:1100.\r\n\r\nFlemish Cap.--Profile W-2 crosses the Grand Banks, along its widest\r\neast-west axis, and also the semidetached bank called Flemish Cap. The\r\nshelf is much smoother than in profile W-1, except for a small deep of\r\nabout 100 fathoms immediately east of Newfoundland. The shelf break at\r\n150 fathoms is followed by a continental slope 150 to 500 fathoms deep\r\nwhich has a gradient of 1:20. The Flemish Cap is a difficult feature\r\nto classify. It is too large to be a seamount and too shallow to be a\r\nmarginal plateau. We must treat it as a part of the continental shelf,\r\nsemidetached from the rest by a 650-fathom-deep channel. The eastern\r\nflank of the Flemish Cap slopes off at gradients of 1:100 and 1:60\r\nuntil at a depth of 650 fathoms the bottom drops precipitously to 1750\r\nfathoms at a gradient of 1:10. Seaward of this point an 85-mile-wide\r\ncontinental rise has a gradient of 1:65 and 1:250 down to the\r\nNewfoundland Abyssal Plain which is at a depth of 2400 fathoms. Twenty\r\nmiles east of the continental rise this profile crosses the Northwest\r\nAtlantic Mid-Ocean Canyon.\r\n\r\nOn profile W-3 the shelf is quite smooth, and the shelf break is\r\nreached at 60 fathoms. The profile runs slightly oblique to the\r\ncontinental slope and reveals a series of submarine canyons. The base\r\nof the slope is at 1700 fathoms where the gradient drops to less than\r\n1:200.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 11.--_Two east-west profiles of Southeast\r\nNewfoundland Ridge_\r\n\r\nPositions of profiles are indexed on Plate 23. Both profiles plotted\r\nfrom nonprecision soundings (NMC).]\r\n\r\nSoutheast Newfoundland Ridge.--From the southern tip of the Grand Banks\r\na broad ridge runs southeasterly toward the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and\r\nforms a natural barrier between the Newfoundland Basin and the North\r\nAmerica Basin [to the south]. Since it is almost impossible to define\r\na boundary between the continental rise and the ridge, we consider the\r\nSoutheast Newfoundland Ridge an extension of the continental rise. The\r\nridge is 60-100 miles wide, and its crest plunges southeastward from\r\ndepths of 1500 fathoms near 50° W. to depths of 2200 fathoms near 45°\r\nW. Profiles N-1 and N-2 (Fig. 11) cross the Southeast Newfoundland\r\nRidge at about 41.5° N. and 39.5° N. respectively. Profile N-1 is of\r\npoor quality, which probably accounts for the lack of fine-textured\r\nrelief. The Mid-Ocean Canyon is again seen at the eastern end of\r\nProfile N-2. Profile W-5 (Pl. 24) crosses the Southeast Newfoundland\r\nRidge from north to south. The similarity of profiles W-5 and W-23\r\nsuggests that the Southeast Newfoundland Ridge is an outer ridge of the\r\nsame kind as the one east of the Blake-Bahama region. The northern one\r\nis not so long, and it does not totally enclose a basin. Otherwise, it\r\nis quite similar to the outer ridge east of the Bahamas in relative\r\nposition, size, and surface features. The term Southeast Newfoundland\r\nRidge was proposed by Wüst (1940b; 1943) and the feature has been shown\r\non bathymetric charts (Tolstoy, 1951) and profiles (Emery, 1950). This\r\nridge will be discussed again in connection with the Mid-Ocean Canyon\r\nand the ocean-basin floor.\r\n\r\nSouthern Grand Banks Sector.--Profiles W-4 and W-5 cross the southern\r\ntip of the Grand Banks. The shelf break is at 50 fathoms on both\r\nprofiles. On Profile W-4 an apparent gradient of 1:25 extends from\r\n200 to about 1000 fathoms where, after some irregularities probably\r\nassociated with submarine canyons, the gradient drops to 1:40. This\r\nlower gradient extends to 1750 fathoms. Profile W-5 is quite similar to\r\nW-4 except that a steep initial slope of 1:5, from about 200 fathoms to\r\n650 fathoms, is followed by a gradient of 1:80 which continues to 1000\r\nfathoms. This same terracelike feature is also seen on W-3, W-4, W-5,\r\nW-6, W-7, and W-8. Below 1000 fathoms a gradient of about 1:50 is found\r\non profiles W-4, W-5, W-6, W-7, and W-8. Profile W-6 runs south of the\r\nGrand Banks through the epicenter of the 1929 Grand Banks earthquake\r\nand then south through the area passed over by the 1929 Grand Banks\r\nturbidity current (Heezen and Ewing, 1952). The depression marked by\r\nthe 1150-fathom sounding on the continental slope in Profile W-6 is\r\na canyon running south from the Laurentian Channel. The continental\r\nrise is 250 miles wide and has an average gradient of 1:400 over its\r\ndeepest third. At a depth of 2750 fathoms the gradient abruptly drops\r\nto 1:2000, and this marks the northern edge of the Sohm Abyssal Plain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 12.--_Laurentian Channel_\r\n\r\nProfile replotted from NMC echogram]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 13.--_Eastern Channel, Gulf of Maine_\r\n\r\nProfile replotted from NMC echogram]\r\n\r\nLaurentian Channel.--Between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland a\r\n60-mile-wide, steep-sided, flat-floored channel cuts across the\r\ncontinental shelf connecting the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the open\r\nocean. The nearly flat, smooth floor of this channel lies at about\r\n230 fathoms depth. Figure 12 shows a cross-section of the Laurentian\r\nChannel near its seaward end. The origin and physiography of the\r\nchannel has been treated by Shepard (1931; 1948); its structure has\r\nbeen reported by Press and Beckmann (1954). The Laurentian Channel\r\ncontinues as a steep-sided, box-shaped feature for more than 500 miles\r\ninto the Gulf of St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nScotian Shelf Sector.--The term Scotian Shelf was introduced by\r\nCanadian oceanographers and refers to the continental shelf southeast\r\nof Nova Scotia from the Laurentian Channel to the Gulf of Maine. This\r\nregion is illustrated by Profiles W-7, W-8, W-9, W-10, and W-11 which\r\nrun at slightly different directions, all starting in the vicinity\r\nof Halifax, Nova Scotia. Along the entire Scotian Shelf a series of\r\n120-fathom depressions are located 10 to 80 miles off shore. A nearly\r\ncontinuous bank 20-60 fathoms deep and 10-25 miles wide lies along the\r\nseaward edge of the Scotian Shelf. From northeast to southwest this\r\nfeature is divided by low saddles into Banquereau Bank (20-40 fathoms),\r\nSable Island Bank (0-20 fathoms), Emerald Bank (40-60 fathoms), Lahave\r\nBank (50-60 fathoms), and Browns Bank (20-60 fathoms). These shelf-edge\r\nbanks culminate in the low, sandy Sable Island which stretches for\r\nabout 25 miles along the outer edge of the shelf. In profile W-7 the\r\nbreak from the nearly flat shelf to a gradient of 1:50 occurs at 50\r\nfathoms; a second break occurs at 80 fathoms. A gradient of 1:10 is\r\nreached at the 150-fathom curve. Profile W-11 is somewhat similar to\r\nW-7 in the form of the shelf break. Profiles W-8, W-9, and W-10 show\r\nshelf breaks at 50, 60, and 70 fathoms respectively.\r\n\r\nThe gradient of the continental slope off the Scotian Shelf ranges\r\nfrom 1:10 to 1:25 along the profiles. In profiles W-7, W-8, W-10,\r\nand W-11 the 1:25 gradient abruptly decreases to 1:70 at about 700\r\nfathoms; in W-9 the 1:25 gradient continues to almost 2000 fathoms. It\r\nis difficult to decide whether to include the 1:40 to 1:60 segments\r\nwith the continental slope or with the continental rise. However, since\r\nwe have picked the gradient of 1:40 as the minimum gradient for true\r\ncontinental slopes, these segments fall within the continental rise.\r\nThe continental rise thus defined averages 160 miles in width off\r\nthe Scotian Shelf. Gradients are generally greater here than in the\r\ncontinental rise farther south. The \"Gully\", a large submarine canyon\r\nshown on navigational charts, lies about 25 miles east of Sable Island.\r\nThe submarine canyons of the Scotian Shelf have not been accurately\r\nmapped, but the existence of many canyons in this area has been shown\r\nby several fathograms obtained in this vicinity. Figure 14 illustrates\r\none sounding profile nearly parallel to the shelf near the \"Gully\".\r\nSeveral small canyons about 100 fathoms deep occur between 100 and 700\r\nfathoms. Several larger canyons 300-500 fathoms deep and 7-10 miles\r\nwide are crossed on the lower continental slope and upper continental\r\nrise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 14.--_Submarine canyons off the Scotian Shelf_\r\n\r\nProfile replotted from NMC echogram runs nearly parallel to trend of\r\ncontinental slope near Sable Island. On navigational charts largest\r\ncanyon is known as the \"Gully\".]\r\n\r\nGulf of Maine Entrance.--Southwest of the Scotian Shelf there is a\r\nnarrow gap in the continental shelf similar to the Laurentian Channel.\r\nThis feature, called either the Northeast Trough (Shepard, 1948) or\r\nEastern Channel of the Gulf of Maine, is 15 miles wide and about 150\r\nfathoms deep; it provides a deep-water entrance to the Gulf of Maine\r\n(Fig. 13). The Gulf of Maine is enclosed by Georges Bank off the New\r\nEngland shelf, Cape Cod, and southern Nova Scotia. This entrance has\r\nrecently been described by Torphy and Zeigler (1957).\r\n\r\nGulf of Maine Interior.--Much of the interior of the Gulf of Maine\r\nhas been surveyed in exceptional detail by the Coast and Geodetic\r\nSurvey. The reader is referred to Murray's paper (1947) for a thorough\r\ndescription of the floor of the Gulf of Maine. In general the floor is\r\nextremely irregular with several 20- to 40-fathom \"hills\" per mile. The\r\nfloor is covered by sediment which transmits sound so readily that the\r\narea is noted for exceptionally pronounced sub-bottom reflections from\r\nthe rock layers beneath the sediment.\r\n\r\nNortheastern United States Sector.--From the northeast tip of Georges\r\nBank to Cape Hatteras the continental margin is remarkably uniform in\r\nmorphologic detail. Profiles W-12 to W-19 differ very little from the\r\ntype profile off northeastern United States (Fig. 15). The continental\r\nshelf and slope in this area are better surveyed than in any other\r\narea in the Atlantic. The surveys of the Coast and Geodetic Survey\r\nwere contoured and described by Veatch and Smith (1939). The sediment\r\nstudies of Stetson (1936; 1938; 1949) and the seismic studies of Ewing\r\nand others (1937 _et seq._) make this geologically the best-known\r\nshelf and slope in the world. Many large and well-mapped canyons cut\r\nthe continental slope from Georges Bank to Cape Hatteras. The large\r\nsubmarine canyons off Georges Bank have attracted great interest\r\nbecause of their remoteness from rivers and associated discharges of\r\nriver sediments.\r\n\r\nThe continental shelf is 50 to 100 miles wide in this sector. Toward\r\nCape Hatteras the coastal plain widens as the shelf narrows. The\r\ncombined features are called the \"emerged and submerged coastal plain.\"\r\nThe gradient of the continental slope ranges from 1:8 to 1:15 and the\r\nbase of the slope with one exception is at 1150 ± 100 fathoms. The\r\nshelf break is at about 50 fathoms on all profiles. On profiles W-12,\r\nW-13, W-14, W-15, W-18, and Figure 1 of Plate 4 there is a second break\r\nat 75-100 fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe break between the continental slope and the upper continental rise\r\nis abrupt at some places and occupies a distance of 5 to 10 miles in\r\nother places (Fig. 16). In each case the gradient of the next lower 30-\r\nto 50-mile segment is 1:100.\r\n\r\nAll profiles from Georges Bank to Cape Hatteras, a span of more than\r\n500 miles, show both an upper and a lower continental rise (Profiles\r\nW-13, W-19, and Fig. 15). The uniformity in the continental slope\r\ngradient carries over into the continental rise. Both the upper\r\ncontinental rise and the lower continental rise are divided into three\r\nsegments. The width, gradient, and depths of each of the slope segments\r\nare remarkably similar. Representative values based on profiles W-13 to\r\nW-19 and Figure 15 are shown in Table 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 15.--_Continental margin provinces: Type profile\r\noff northeastern United States._\r\n\r\nProfile plotted from PDR records.

Each has a relatively\r\nsteep (1:50-1:200) outer face (segment 3) and a relatively gentle\r\n(1:250-1:2000) shelflike surface (segment 2). In each case a slope\r\nof intermediate gradient (1:80-1:300) (segment 1) connects the upper\r\nshelflike surface with the next higher face. In the case of the upper\r\ncontinental rise the next higher face is the continental slope. Other\r\nsmaller-scale terracelike features may eventually be correlated along\r\nthe strike when more data are available. The local relief exceeds 20\r\nfathoms in the deeper parts of segment 3 of the lower continental rise.\r\nA range of hills extends for a few hundred miles along the base of\r\nthe continental rise as indicated on the physiographic province chart\r\n(Pl. 20). These hills, known as the lower continental rise hills,\r\nare 30-100 fathoms high and each is 1 to 3 miles wide. An echogram\r\n(Pl. 3, fig. 4) shows three continental rise hills. The only other\r\npart of the continental rise where relief of more than 20 fathoms is\r\ngenerally encountered is in segment 1 of the upper continental rise.\r\nThe irregularity in this case is probably related to the extensions of\r\nnumerous continental-slope canyons onto the continental rise. Relief\r\nof 5-10 fathoms is almost universal in segments 1 and 2 of the upper\r\ncontinental rise. The echogram reproduced in Figure 1 of Plate 3 shows\r\ntypical minor-relief features of the upper continental rise. An oblique\r\ncrossing of a submarine canyon on the upper continental rise is shown\r\nin Figure 2 of Plate 3. The smooth topography typical of most of the\r\nremainder of the continental rise is well illustrated by the echogram\r\nshown in Figure 3 of Plate 3.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson Submarine Canyon cuts across the continental rise in this\r\nsector. A chart contoured by Ivan Tolstoy and the authors from surveys\r\nmade in 1949 is shown in Plate 2 (Ericson, Ewing, and Heezen, 1951). A\r\nseries of 30 cross profiles is shown in Figure 17.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 16.--_Tracings of PDR records of continental and\r\ninsular slopes_\r\n\r\n  (a). Insular slope of Madeira southwest of Funchal.\r\n  (b). Continental slope of Europe.\r\n  (c). Continental slope off northeastern United States.]\r\n\r\nThe Hudson Canyon, which is more than 500 fathoms deep and 5 miles\r\nwide in the continental slope (Upper Gorge), narrows to less than 2\r\nmiles and shallows to 50 fathoms at the base of the continental slope.\r\nAs it cuts across segment 2 of the upper continental rise the canyon\r\ngradually deepens. When it cuts into the upper part of segment 3 the\r\ncanyon deepens to 300 + fathoms, widens to 3 + miles, and forms the\r\nLower Gorge. The canyon gradually narrows and shallows as it cuts\r\nacross the lower continental rise. It ends near Caryn Peak where\r\nsediment cores indicate an extensive delta or submarine alluvial cone.\r\nThe upper continental rise and the lower continental rise can be\r\ntentatively traced northeastward through the Scotian Shelf and Grand\r\nBanks sectors. The irregular bench at 2250-2450 fathoms on W-6 and\r\nthe bench at 2300 fathoms on W-8 and W-11 can probably be referred to\r\nsegment 2 of the lower continental rise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNear Cape Hatteras the entire character of the continental margin\r\nchanges. Benches which were barely discernible farther north widen\r\nto form a series of broad steps which resemble a giant staircase\r\ndescending to the depths of the Atlantic. These benches appear to merge\r\nwith the benches of the Blake Plateau and Escarpment farther south.\r\nHowever, insufficient profiles exist to permit a firm correlation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 17.--_Cross sections of Hudson Submarine Canyon_\r\n\r\nReplotted from nonprecision soundings (NMC) made 1949-1950]\r\n\r\nBlake Plateau Sector.--This sector is divided into two parts, the\r\nnorthern part from Cape Hatteras to 29° N. (essentially a transition\r\nzone) and the southern or main Blake Plateau between 29° N. and the\r\nnorthern edge of the Bahamas at 26° N.\r\n\r\nThe shelf break lies parallel to the coast, about 60 miles offshore,\r\nfrom just south of Cape Hatteras to Cape Canaveral. The continental\r\nslope extends (at a gradient of 1:40) only to depths of 300-400 fathoms\r\nwhere the lower gradients (_ca._ 1:1000) of the Blake Plateau are found.\r\n\r\nThe main or southern Blake Plateau is 170 miles wide (east-west) and\r\nextends from the latitude of Grand Bahama Island to 30° N. From this\r\npoint to Cape Hatteras the Blake Plateau narrows and disappears. The\r\nBlake Escarpment forms a precipitous drop to abyssal depths along the\r\neastern edge of the plateau. The top of the Blake Escarpment lies at\r\nabout 550 fathoms, and its base at about 2600 fathoms. The Escarpment\r\nis typically formed by two or three distinct slope segments.\r\n\r\nAn echogram obtained along a track running southeast from Charleston,\r\nSouth Carolina, is reproduced in Figure 1 of Plate 7. The continental\r\nshelf extends from the shore at an extremely low gradient to the\r\n25-fathom isobath where a small definite notch marks an increase in\r\ngradient to 1:1000. This gradient continues to the 50-fathom isobath\r\nwhere it changes to 1:40. At the 90-fathom curve the gradient increases\r\nto 1:120 and continues to 160 fathoms where it finally increases to\r\n1:40. This continental slope drops from 160 fathoms to 280 fathoms\r\nwhere the gradient flattens, and the surface changes from smooth to\r\nrough, with hills 10 to 20 fathoms high and half a mile to 1-½ miles\r\nwide. These hills, which extend for 4-6 miles along the profile,\r\ndirectly underlie the Gulf Stream.\r\n\r\nFor 50 miles seaward of these hills the ocean floor is irregular\r\nbetween 230 and 300 fathoms. At 90 miles from shore five\r\neastward-facing scarps 10-20 fathoms high form a striking contrast to\r\nthe generally smooth, gently rolling topography. At 300 fathoms the\r\ngradient increases to 1:200, and the sea floor drops for the next 24\r\nmiles to 400 fathoms where a few small hills are associated with a drop\r\nin the gradient to 1:1000. Southeast of this point the bottom is smooth\r\nuntil at a depth of 430 fathoms a steep scarp drops abruptly 30 fathoms\r\nto form a mile-wide depression 20-30 fathoms deep. The southeast side\r\nof this feature rises to 445 fathoms, and southeastward of a few\r\n5-fathom scarps the surface of the Blake Plateau becomes smooth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PL. 3\r\n\r\nFIGURE 1.

The small definite notch at 26 fathoms is\r\npresent, but a significant difference between the two echograms is seen\r\nbetween 90 and 300 fathoms. On the Charleston profile a steep 1:40\r\ngradient slope marks this depth range, while, on the Daytona Beach\r\nprofile, the gradient is relatively gentle (1:180); small but probably\r\nsignificant benches are found at 225, 270, 290, 375, and 385 fathoms.\r\nBoth profiles have the same characteristic rugged 5- to 15-fathom hills\r\nat 400 fathoms at a point underlying the Gulf Stream. On the Charleston\r\nprofile a broad, gently fractured arch separates the continental\r\nslope from the smooth outer part of the Blake Plateau. The small,\r\nsharp-crested hills noted on the Daytona Beach and Charleston profiles\r\nare also found at the north end of the Straits of Florida (Pl. 4, fig.\r\n2).\r\n\r\nBlake Escarpment.--Profiles W-23, W-24, and W-25 and Figure 18\r\nillustrate the form of the Blake Escarpment. The outer edge of the\r\nBlake Plateau abruptly breaks off at about 600 fathoms. Here gradients\r\nincrease to 1:30. This segment continues with a few minor breaks to a\r\ndepth of 1200 to 1500 fathoms where a narrow bench or at least a major\r\nbreak in slope occurs. Below this bench the escarpment drops so steeply\r\nthat only a few side echoes are recorded. The gradient here exceeds 1:2\r\nin several profiles. At 2400 fathoms there is in places another narrow\r\nbench, but on other profiles the abyssal plain of the floor of the\r\nBlake-Bahama Basin lies directly at the foot of the steepest segment. A\r\npeculiar fact is that along many east-west cross sections the deepest\r\npoint in the basin lies directly at the foot of the escarpment. A\r\nsimilar deepening adjacent to the Campeche and West Florida escarpments\r\nin the Gulf of Mexico has been reported (Ewing, Ericson, Heezen, 1958).\r\n\r\nAntilles Outer Ridge.--South of Cape Hatteras a ridge ranging in width\r\nfrom 60 to 200 miles lies about 100 miles east of the Blake Escarpment\r\nand the Bahama Banks. The ridge has two parallel crests 100 miles apart\r\nwhich both plunge to the south. At 30°N. the crests average about 1600\r\nfathoms in depth, but at 25°N. they are 2750 fathoms, a drop of nearly\r\n1000 fathoms in 300 miles. The smooth rolling topography of the ridge\r\nbetween Cape Hatteras and 24°N. resembles the continental rise off New\r\nYork or, in some areas, the somewhat stronger relief of the Bermuda\r\nPlateau of the central Bermuda Rise (Pl. 5, figs. 1, 2).\r\n\r\nSouth of 24°N. and in the vicinity of Hispaniola the ridge is poorly\r\nknown and difficult to study because of its low relief and the large\r\nerrors in most nonprecision soundings taken in such a great depth\r\nof water. North of Puerto Rico the outer ridge appears as a clearly\r\ndefined feature between the Puerto Rico Trench on the south and the\r\nNares Abyssal Plain on the north. Again there are two parallel crests\r\n60 miles apart marked by low relief of 20 to 100 fathoms at a depth of\r\n2750 fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe Antilles Outer Ridge, continuing to the east, merges with the Lower\r\nStep of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. But more probably it skirts the Lesser\r\nAntilles to join the continental rise off South America. The crest\r\nzone is covered by _Globigerina_ ooze in the north and red clay in the\r\nsouth; it is isolated from the silty clays of the continental slope\r\nexcept on its northwest flank. Sub-bottom echoes appear on fathograms\r\ntaken across the outer ridge. Data suggest that a prominent 8- to\r\n10-fathom sub-bottom interface extends over the outer ridge between San\r\nSalvador and 30°N. (Pl. 6).\r\n\r\nBahamas Sector.--The Bahamas sector can be divided into two parts: (1)\r\nthe broad (200 miles wide) northern area dominated by broad, shallow\r\nbanks broken by relatively narrow, deep (_ca._ 1000 fathoms) tongues\r\nor channels; (2) the narrow southeastern part where the banks decrease\r\nin area and the tongues deepen (to 2200 fathoms) and widen. This\r\nsoutheastern part tapers to the east in the direction of the Puerto\r\nRico Trench. The southeast tip of this area is formed by Navidad Bank,\r\nwhose eastern slopes drop to the floor of the Puerto Rico Trench.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 18.--_Tracing of PDR record of Blake Escarpment_\r\n\r\nNo soundings were recorded between 1600 and 2400 fathoms, a common\r\ndifficulty on this precipitous escarpment. Note how Blake-Bahama\r\nAbyssal Plain slopes toward the base of the escarpment.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Bahama Banks appear to consist of a slab superimposed on the same\r\nsurface which forms the Blake Plateau. The Blake Escarpment merges\r\nwith the lower part of the eastern slope of the Bahamas. The slopes of\r\nthe Bahamas are precipitous; gradients are of the order of 1:4 to 1:8.\r\nVertical cliffs, which lie just below the 50-fathom curve, have been\r\nreported by lead soundings (Armstrong, 1953). The Tongue of the Ocean\r\nand the Northeast and Northwest Providence channels form a network of\r\nsubmarine canyons (Hess, 1933). The floor of this canyon system has a\r\ncontinuous down-slope gradient to the floor of the Blake-Bahama Basin.\r\nSediment cores from the floor of the Blake-Bahama Basin (2525 fathoms)\r\n(Ericson, Ewing, and Heezen, 1952) contained thick (1-3 m) beds of\r\ngraded calcareous sand. The steep slopes of the Bahamas are generally\r\nrocky, and cores here reveal a variety of Tertiary and Cretaceous\r\nsediments. Exuma Sound also is linked by submarine canyons to the\r\nBlake-Bahama Basin. The graded calcareous sands of the Blake-Bahama\r\nBasin were probably carried through this submarine canyon system by\r\nturbidity currents. The topographic benches of Exuma Sound have been\r\ndescribed by Lee (1951).\r\n\r\nThe southeastern Bahamas from Great Inagua to Navidad Bank consist of\r\nmore numerous isolated banks and greater expanses of ocean floor in\r\nthe depth range of 1700-2400 fathoms. The basins behind the southern\r\nBahamas lie below the sill depth between the line of banks. Thus an\r\nabyssal plain lies entrapped in the Hispaniola-Caicos Channel and the\r\nsoutheastern portion of the Old Bahama Channel. Profile W-29 (Pl. 24)\r\nshows much irregular relief between 1000 and 1500 fathoms.\r\n\r\nPuerto Rico Trench Sector.--With the disappearance of the Bahama Banks\r\nat the eastern edge of Navidad Bank, the continental margin assumes\r\nits third mode of expression: the marginal trench-outer ridge complex.\r\nThe outer ridge, which nearly disappeared in the southeastern Bahama\r\nsector, again becomes a prominent feature. The last traces of the\r\nmarginal plateau merge with the continental slope of Hispaniola and\r\nPuerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Trench develops rapidly east of Navidad\r\nBank; it lies between the outer ridge and the continental slope or\r\nlandward trench slope of the Greater Antilles. The relief of the outer\r\nridge is somewhat greater than that observed on the outer ridge farther\r\nnorthwest near the Blake Plateau. The floor of the Puerto Rico Trench\r\nis divided into two parts by a longitudinal ridge. The deepest parts\r\nof both are floored by nearly level trench plains. The deeper one on\r\nthe outer or northern side maintains a nearly constant depth at 4358\r\nfathoms (4585 fathoms corrected) for 150 miles (Ewing and Heezen,\r\n1955). The southern or inner trench is more variable in depth, and the\r\ntrench plain lies intermittently along its length. Its depth ranges\r\nfrom 3600 to 4300 fathoms (uncorrected). The walls of the Puerto Rico\r\nTrench are formed by a series of extremely steep segments which show\r\na remarkable persistence along the trench. Profiles W-32 and W-33\r\nillustrate the typical trench profile north of Puerto Rico. Breaks in\r\nslope are observed at 700 fathoms and at 1500 fathoms; at 2000 fathoms\r\nthe gradient steepens to > 1:6. In this region all soundings are side\r\nechoes. The outer or seaward wall of the trench is also characterized\r\nby a succession of laterally persistent slope segments. A bench at 3800\r\nfathoms at the top of a scarp which drops to the bottom of the trench\r\nis characteristic of several profiles.\r\n\r\nAnegada Passage.--The Virgin Islands Bank extends 30 miles east of\r\nPuerto Rico along the south side of the Puerto Rico Trench. Between\r\nthe Virgin Islands Bank and St. Croix a deep passage cuts through from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Caribbean. This deep passage is 130 miles long and\r\nruns along an e-ne-w-sw line. Its walls are extremely steep (9°-43°)\r\n(Frassetto and Northrop, 1957). The structure of this feature has been\r\nstudied by Shurbet and Worzel (1957) and by J. Ewing et al. (1957).\r\n\r\nSOUTHWESTERN EUROPE AND NORTHWEST AFRICA: The continental margin of\r\nEurope and Africa is illustrated in Plate 25 by only 23 profiles, and\r\ntherefore our description of this area cannot be as detailed as that\r\nfor North America. For purposes of description we have broken the area\r\ninto four sectors of contrasting type: (1) the Anglo-French sector: (2)\r\nthe Iberian sector; (3) the Gibraltar sector; and (4) the North African\r\nsector. In all but the three profiles in the Gibraltar sector there is\r\na well-defined continental shelf. The continental slope is everywhere\r\npresent but ranges widely in height and gradient. The continental rise\r\nis extremely well developed off Africa but virtually absent in the Bay\r\nof Biscay. Abyssal plains are shown on almost every profile, but their\r\ndepth ranges from 2550 to 3075 fathoms, and their width from 50 to 250\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nAnglo French Sector.--Profiles E-1, E-2, and E-3 are representative of\r\nthe Anglo-French sector which extends from 45° N. to 60° N. Only the\r\nsouthern part of this sector is shown on the physiographic diagram. The\r\ncontinental slope is broken by a prominent bench or marginal plateau at\r\n1000-1200 fathoms. The northwest corner of the physiographic diagram\r\nsouth to 42° N. is included in Hill's (1956) contour chart. According\r\nto this chart the prominent 1200-fathom bench extends for more than 900\r\nmiles along the continental margin from 45° to 60° North Latitude.\r\n\r\nThe continental slope from the shelf break to the prominent bench\r\nexhibits smaller benches and changes in slope, many of which probably\r\nwill be correlatable when more profiles are obtained in this region.\r\nThe general gradient of this portion of the slope ranges from 1:10\r\nto 1:30. On the bench individual slope segments range from 1:40 to\r\n1:80. Below the bench the sea floor drops from 1500 to 2100 fathoms at\r\ngradients of 1:15 to 1:30.\r\n\r\nIn profiles E-1 and E-3 a narrow continental rise about 70 miles wide\r\nwith gradients of 1:250 to 1:800 lies at the foot of the continental\r\nslope. This narrow continental rise (Pl. 8, fig. 1) gives away to a\r\n60-mile-wide abyssal plain at about 2500 fathoms depth (Pl. 8, fig.\r\n3). Abyssal-plain gradients are about 1:2000 in this region. Toward\r\nthe southeast corner of the Bay of Biscay the 1000- to 1200-fathom\r\nbench disappears (Fig. 16b); the continental rise and continental shelf\r\nnarrow to 30 miles. We have only two profiles off the north coast of\r\nIberia, but Hill's (1956) chart suggests that the slope is relatively\r\nsteep with some prominent benches, and that the continental shelf and\r\ncontinental rise narrow to 10 to 15 miles in width. The prominent Cape\r\nBreton Submarine Canyon lies at the southeast corner of the Bay of\r\nBiscay (Bourcart, 1949).\r\n\r\nIberian Sector.--This sector was described by De Andrade (1937) on\r\nthe basis of a large number of discrete soundings by the Portuguese\r\nHydrographic Service. Relatively few echo-sounding profiles are\r\navailable for the area, and little more can be added to De Andrade's\r\ndescription. The shelf in most places is less than 20 miles in width.\r\nThe few echo-sounding profiles available indicate several prominent\r\nbenches on the continental slope. Exceptionally large submarine\r\ncanyons occur off Cape St. Vincent, Setúbal, Lisbon (2), and Nazaré.\r\nPreliminary investigations by the Lamont Geological Observatory\r\nindicate that Tertiary sediments outcrop on the walls of Lisbon and\r\nSetúbal canyons (Sutton _et al._, 1957). Tertiary sediments have also\r\nbeen obtained by dredging and cable grappling along the continental\r\nslope of northwest Iberia (Wiseman and Ovey, 1950).\r\n\r\nGibraltar Sector.--The continental margin in this sector is unique. The\r\nstraits cut through at about 200 fathoms so that profiles through the\r\nstraits show no continental shelf. A typical abrupt continental slope\r\nis also absent since only locally do slope segments have gradients\r\nexceeding 1:45. A series of prominent benches is seen in the sector\r\nfrom profile E-7 to E-10.\r\n\r\nThe dominant bench levels in this sector are 300, 600, 850, 1300, 1700,\r\nand 2100 fathoms. Insufficient profiles and dredgings are available\r\nin this area to permit the correlation and dating of these benches.\r\nPhotographs in the area show sandy and rocky bottom, and thus dredging\r\nin this area might yield rich rewards in ancient sediments. The benches\r\nare so prominent that a detailed study of the topography should be\r\nequally rewarding. Of particular interest is the manner in which the\r\nbroad benches in the Gibraltar area merge with the smaller benches\r\nand breaks in slope of the steep continental slopes of Portugal and\r\nAlgeria. The topography in this sector most closely resembles that\r\nof the northern Blake Plateau (profiles W-21, W-22) and the northern\r\npart of the Anglo-French sector. In all these areas many benches are\r\ndeveloped, and steep slopes are only locally developed.\r\n\r\nNorthwest African Sector.--The continental margin from northwest\r\nMorocco to Dakar is remarkably uniform and rather closely resembles\r\nthe northeastern United States sector. The continental shelf and slope\r\nare well developed (Fig. 19). The shelf is 15 to 70 miles in width\r\nand thus is somewhat narrower than either the North American shelf or\r\nthe Anglo-French shelf. The shelf break ranges from 50 to 80 fathoms.\r\nThe continental-slope gradients range from 1:15 to 1:40 and are thus\r\nsomewhat less steep than in the American sectors. Prominent benches\r\nare common at 300, 600, 850, 1200, and 1600 fathoms. The continental\r\nrise is well developed and is compound. The main contrast between the\r\nNorth African and American sectors is the greater width of the African\r\ncontinental rise. Off northeastern United States a line of isolated\r\nvolcanic peaks cuts across the continental rise and abyssal plain. In\r\nthe North African continental margin volcanic peaks are larger, more\r\nnumerous, and lie in coalescing lines or along ridges. The Cape Verde\r\nand Canary groups lie in the continental rise near the outer edge of\r\nthe upper continental rise. All provinces except the continental shelf\r\nwiden from Gibraltar southward toward Cape Verde.\r\n\r\nOn profile E-11 off Casablanca the distance from the shelf break to\r\nthe lower continental rise is only 50 miles as compared with a similar\r\nmeasurement of 500 miles at Cape Verde. Off Casablanca the continental\r\nslope extends to 1400 fathoms where the gradient drops to less than\r\n1:40 from 1:10-1:20 on the continental slope. The upper continental\r\nrise which widens to more than 100 miles farther south is only poorly\r\ndeveloped off Morocco. No other deep-sea echo-sounding profiles\r\nare available for the Moroccan continental margin. Surveys of the\r\ncontinental slope made by the French Hydrographic Service during the\r\npast few years will, when published in full, undoubtedly provide much\r\nvaluable information on the topographic benches in this important area\r\n(Grousson, 1957).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                                  HEEZEN _et al._, PL. 8\r\n\r\nFIGURE 1.

Here the continental slope extends\r\nonly to 1000 fathoms. The Canary Islands rise abruptly from the\r\ncontinental rise. Except for gradients of the order of 1:15 on the\r\nsteep slopes of these volcanic islands the gradients of the continental\r\nrise are 1:300-1:1000.\r\n\r\nProfiles E-13 and E-14 end on the east near Gran Canary and thus do not\r\nshow most of the upper continental rise. They do show the remarkably\r\nwide and nearly level lower continental rise which reaches a width of\r\nmore than 500 miles.\r\n\r\nProfiles E-15 and E-16 lie off Spanish Sahara. In both profiles the\r\ngradient is 1:10 to 1:20 between the 50-fathom shelf break and a bench\r\nat 300-500 fathoms. In both profiles the gradient drops below 1:40 at\r\nabout 1200 fathoms. Both profiles show numerous prominent benches on\r\nthe continental slope. The upper continental rise with gradients of\r\n1:350-1:1200 extends to the western limit of the profiles.\r\n\r\nIn profiles E-17 and E-18 the continental slope becomes gentler,\r\nand only in the upper 500 fathoms of E-18 does the gradient exceed\r\n1:25. The upper continental rise is about 60 miles wide with depths\r\npredominantly about 1600 fathoms, and the lower continental rise lies\r\nat about 2100 fathoms and is very smooth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 19.--_Continental-margin provinces: Type\r\nprofiles off Northwest Africa_]\r\n\r\nProfiles E-19, E-20, and E-21 cross the continental margin off Dakar\r\nand the Cape Verde Plateau which rises from the lower continental\r\nrise. The Cape Verde Plateau consists largely of the coalescing bases\r\nof the volcanic Cape Verde Islands. The lower continental rise and\r\nthe abyssal plain reach their maximum width at this latitude. The\r\nwidth of the ocean, the width of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the width\r\nof the abyssal hills, and the depth at the axis of maximum depth all\r\nreach their maximum values for the North Atlantic at this point. The\r\ncharacteristics of the continental rise in this sector are listed in\r\nTable 2.

Other submarine canyons are certainly present in the sector\r\nsince any profile parallel to the strike of the topography reveals\r\nlarge irregularities probably related to canyons. Echograms (Pls.\r\n9, 13) taken in the continental rise in this sector show distinct\r\ncontrasts in the topographic detail of the sea floor. The rugged\r\ntopography of the abyssal hills (Pl. 9, fig. 4) contrasts sharply with\r\nthe nearly flat, extremely smooth abyssal plain. (Pl. 9, fig. 3).\r\nThe continental rise is nowhere so smooth nor so flat as the abyssal\r\nplain. The continental rise ranges from 10- to 20-fathom rolling hills\r\n5-10 miles in width to 2- to 5-fathom hills a few hundred feet across\r\n(Fig. 19). At the seaward edge of the abyssal plain the echo sounder\r\npenetrates the bottom to reveal interfaces 5-20 fathoms below (Pl.\r\n13, Fig. 4). Sub-bottom penetration of 5-15 fathoms is occasionally\r\nencountered on the continental rise on local topographic highs. Lower\r\ncontinental-rise hills of the type observed off eastern United States\r\nhave not been observed off Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENCHES AND TERRACES OF THE CONTINENTAL MARGIN\r\n\r\nThe topography of the continental margin provinces is divided into a\r\nseries of benches or terraces. The largest are the continental shelf\r\nand slope (continental terrace) and the upper and lower continental\r\nrise. Superimposed on each of these major features is a series of\r\nsmaller benches and terraces which range from features a few miles wide\r\nto simple breaks in the gradient of the continental slope.\r\n\r\nMany of these features can be traced for hundreds of miles (Heezen _et\r\nal._, in press); some are intermittent, others change in depth with\r\ndistance along the shelf; still others are only locally developed. We\r\ncan propose at least four possible origins for terraces or benches:\r\n(1) ancient shore features; (2) structural (or rock) benching; (3)\r\nblock faulting; and (4) landslide or slump scars.\r\n\r\nThe submerged terraces within a few hundred feet below present sea\r\nlevel can probably best be explained as ancient beaches formed during\r\nthe lower sea levels of the Pleistocene. The fact that the same levels\r\nare found along coasts of diverse geology and tectonic development\r\nsupports the eustatic origin of terraces between sea level and 70-100\r\nfathoms. The gradients of the continental shelf are so low and the\r\nbenches are so persistent that block faulting and slump scars are\r\nexcluded as general explanations. The benches of the continental\r\nslope extend to depths of 1500 fathoms and vary in depth from point\r\nto point along the continental slope. These cannot be Pleistocene\r\neustatic levels unless we consider that they were formed prior to\r\nrecent large crustal deformations. Again the persistence of the benches\r\nfor many miles argues against a fault-scarp or slump-scar hypothesis.\r\nThus, while the benches of the continental shelf are probably ancient\r\nbeaches, particularly those traced at the same depth for thousands of\r\nmiles, the benches of the continental slope are probably rock benches,\r\nwhile some may represent step faulting.\r\n\r\nSUBMERGED BEACHES ON THE CONTINENTAL SHELF: In Table 3 the depths of\r\nterraces or persistent levels of the continental shelf are listed for\r\nselected points in the North Atlantic. There is a remarkable uniformity\r\nin these data; the same levels are found near Newfoundland, in Florida,\r\nand on oceanic islands far from the glaciated areas.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of data obtained in the North Atlantic it is not possible\r\nto date the different terraces, but probably most were formed in\r\nthe period between 12,000 and 5,000 years B.P. when the sea rose in\r\nconsequence of the melting of the Wisconsin glaciers. Coring and\r\ndredging on these submerged ancient beaches could probably produce\r\nmaterial datable by the radiocarbon method.\r\n\r\n     TABLE 3.--_Depth (in fathoms) of prominent continental-shelf\r\n                               terraces_\r\n\r\n          Each column based on only one nonprecision echogram\r\n\r\n  =============================================================================\r\n           |St.    |       |Charles-|       |      |Bar   |St.     |     |\r\n  Placentia|John's,|Norfolk,|ton,   |Bimini,|Miami,|bados,|Vincent,|Dakar|Dakar\r\n  Bay, Nfd.|Nfd.   |Va.     |S.

The stream's\r\ngradient is adjusted to the resistance of the rocks over which it\r\ncuts, and the form of the valley-side slopes reveals the nature of the\r\nunderlying rocks even if they are grassed over.\r\n\r\nThis obvious field method had never been fully applied to the\r\ncontinental margin. Stetson (1936) dredged in the canyons of Georges\r\nBank, and his hauls included Cretaceous sandstones and Tertiary marls\r\nand green sands. He concluded that the canyons had been cut deep into\r\nthe continental margin to expose the underlying Cretaceous rocks,\r\nbut he considered the continental slope the product of depositional\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nHowever Upham (1894) had suggested that the continental slope\r\nformed a continuous outcrop of Tertiary and Cretaceous sediments\r\nfrom Newfoundland to Florida, a suggestion the writers consider\r\nquite probable. That is to say, an analogy can be made between the\r\ncontinental slope and one face of the Grand Canyon or to an erosional\r\nescarpment bounding a high mesa or plateau like the Book Cliffs of Utah\r\nand Colorado.\r\n\r\nOnly a few areas of the world are sufficiently well sounded to\r\nprovide data for a study of structural benches. One cannot expect\r\nto see identical structural benches in each profile even across a\r\nslope composed of a laterally uniform series of horizontal beds of\r\ncontrasting lithologies. The exact mode of erosion, the local system\r\nof jointing, and chance variations in a number of other variables make\r\nit necessary to have a large number of closely spaced, accurately\r\nlocated profiles. We are fortunate that the Coast and Geodetic Survey\r\nhas surveyed virtually the entire continental slope from Georges Bank\r\nto Norfolk, Virginia. Almost all these sounding lines are run at\r\nright angles to the strike of the topography and are thus suitable\r\nfor analysis of structural benches. In this same area the dredgings\r\nof Stetson (1936) on Georges Bank and the Esso Hatteras Light test\r\nprovide us with information on the stratigraphy of the sediments which\r\nform the continental shelf and slope. The seismic work of Ewing and\r\ncollaborators (1937 _et seq._) provides us with further information on\r\nthe dips and on the depths of a number of sedimentary rock series of\r\ncontrasting lithology.\r\n\r\nFishermen began finding fossiliferous rocks on Georges Bank well over a\r\ncentury ago. They were not particularly pleased to obtain rocks instead\r\nof fish and generally threw the accursed rocks back into the sea. Some\r\ncurious fishermen brought a few of the rocks to shore, however, and in\r\ntime some of these were received by the museums (Upham, 1894; Dahl,\r\n1925). These rocks contain Tertiary and Cretaceous fossils. The depths\r\nand positions of recovery of the rocks were generally unknown to the\r\nmuseums, and no clear idea could be gained of the exact occurrence of\r\nthis material. Stetson (1936; 1949) conducted a series of scientific\r\ndredging operations in the Georges Bank area. His aim was to recover\r\nmore of these older rocks from known depth ranges and positions.\r\n\r\nHe concluded that the older rocks outcrop only in the submarine\r\ncanyons. He found no consistent depth ranges for the series of Miocene\r\nand Upper Cretaceous rocks obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 20.--_Georges Bank canyons_\r\n\r\nChart shows position of sounding lines and dredge hauls used to\r\nconstruct projected profile and inferred geologic section shown in\r\nFigure 21 (a). Sounding lines from Coast and Geodetic Survey Chart\r\n1313.]\r\n\r\nIn the Georges Bank area a series of prominent benches continues along\r\nthe continental slope. If these are structural benches we should be\r\nable to trace them up the canyons and thus determine the dip of the\r\nformations. If the benches are the result of step faulting or landslide\r\nscars they would not extend up the canyons. In order to test these\r\nalternatives, a series of profiles has been plotted from the surveys of\r\nthe Coast and Geodetic Survey. A line was drawn which paralleled most\r\nof the contours of the continental slope for 20 miles or more (Fig.\r\n20). A second line was drawn at right angles to this first strike line.\r\nAll sounding lines in the area were projected to this second dip line\r\nalong lines parallel to the strike line, and plotted as a composite\r\nprojected profile (Fig. 21). If the first line was essentially the\r\nstrike of rock layers then we should be able to determine the dip of\r\nthe beds by picking the successive benches as they occur on successive\r\nprofiles across the canyon. In Figure 21 the results of the analysis\r\nof Oceanographer and Hydrographer canyons are presented. The dredge\r\nhauls by Stetson (1949) have also been projected on this profile. We\r\nsee that a major bench occurs at _A_ which passes below the hauls\r\nin which fossiliferous Navarro (Upper Cretaceous) was obtained and\r\nthrough the upper limit of the hauls where Matawan (Upper Cretaceous)\r\nwas obtained. Thus if this horizon or one closely parallel to it is\r\nthe Navarro-Matawan contract, the apparent discrepancies of the depth\r\nranges of Stetson's dredge hauls are explained. Much more important to\r\nthe present study is the dating of a prominent structural bench.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 21.--_Two projected profiles of Georges Bank\r\ncanyons_\r\n\r\nLocation of soundings for profile (a) shown in Figure 20.

Four sounding profiles\r\nmade by R. V. ATLANTIS are projected to profile. Note that resistant\r\nformations form prominent structural benches on continental slope.]\r\n\r\nThe Esso Hatteras Light No. 1 test encountered crystalline rock at\r\n1640 fathoms depth, beneath Lower Cretaceous strata (Spangler, 1950).\r\nThe several holes drilled in the vicinity revealed remarkably constant\r\ndips over a wide area. This is in fact true of the whole coastal plain.\r\nSince the Hatteras well is only 17 miles from the continental slope,\r\nit seems reasonable to project the dips to the continental slope.\r\nWe can then observe whether prominent benches on the continental\r\nslope correlate with resistant strata in the well. We find (Fig.\r\n22) that they do. In the area between Cape Hatteras and Nova Scotia\r\nseveral cores have revealed reworked Eocene, Miocene, and Cretaceous\r\nForaminifera. In 1947 Northrop and Heezen (1951) obtained a photograph\r\nand a core at 500 fathoms on the continental slope. The core contained\r\nEocene (Jackson) sediments, and the photograph showed a rock ledge\r\nbelow the marl sampled. Although sediment cores, particularly those of\r\nreworked material, do not provide as reliable information as dredge\r\nhauls, this outcrop of un-reworked Eocene may also be used in dating\r\nthe structural benches of the continental slope.\r\n\r\nThe structural benches between Cape Hatteras and Cape May are\r\nremarkably uniform and persistent (Fig. 23). On the basis of the\r\nextrapolation shown in Figure 22, the structural benches in this area\r\nhave been correlated with the formations encountered in the Hatteras\r\nwell. North of Cape May a major angular unconformity separates the late\r\nTertiary and Cretaceous formations. Eocene has not been found north of\r\nNantucket. Upper Cretaceous has been found at about 400 fathoms off\r\nGeorges Bank (Fig. 21), and Lower Cretaceous has been dredged at 200\r\nfathoms off Banquereau Bank, Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nBetween 1945 and 1950 workers on the ATLANTIS made several sounding\r\nprofiles east of Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Each\r\ncrossed the precipitous Blake Escarpment. It was quite clear that no\r\nsediment could be accumulating on such a steep escarpment and that beds\r\nof ancient sediments and perhaps crystalline rocks must outcrop on the\r\nescarpment. In 1949 and 1950 a few cores were taken on the escarpment\r\nwhich encountered Miocene and Eocene sediments in depths of 500-800\r\nfathoms (Ericson, Ewing, and Heezen, 1952). The marked similarity of\r\nall topographic profiles further supported the view that the escarpment\r\nwas formed by the outcrop of an orderly sequence of horizontal\r\nsedimentary rock layers. With this specific problem in mind a cruise\r\nwas made to the Blake-Bahama area on the research vessel ATLANTIS, in\r\n1951. More than 50 cores were obtained. Sediments of Recent to Upper\r\nCretaceous age were obtained on the Blake Escarpment and from the\r\nsteep walls of the Bahama Channels (Ericson, Ewing, and Heezen, 1952).\r\nSeismic-refraction work by Katz and Ewing (1955) and Nafe _et al._\r\n(unpublished) and reflection work by Ewing and Landisman (unpublished)\r\nhave revealed that distinct seismic interfaces can be traced into the\r\nstructural benches on the Blake Escarpment. The ancient sediments from\r\nthe Blake Escarpment and the log of the Andros well allow the dating of\r\nsome of these formation contacts. At present the most prominent bench\r\nat 1200-1500 fathoms appears to mark the base of the Upper Cretaceous.\r\nDredging and further coring on the Blake Escarpment below 1400 fathoms\r\nis one of the most promising projects of its type despite the great\r\ndifficulties involved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 23.--_Correlation of structural benches off\r\nnortheast United States_\r\n\r\nSoundings by Coast and Geodetic Survey; 35° 30´N.-38° 30´N.]\r\n\r\nLee (1951), who made a topographic study of Exuma Sound, Bahamas,\r\ntraced several prominent benches through 51 cross sections of the sound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 24.--_Geologic section: Western Europe based on\r\nrefraction measurements_\r\n\r\nData from Day et al. (1956) and Hill (1957). Geologic ages are those\r\nassigned by Day on the basis of velocity; they are not based on\r\ndredging or drilling.]\r\n\r\nSeismic-refraction profiles have been made across the continental slope\r\nsouthwest from the English Channel. These studies were initiated by\r\nBullard and Gaskell (1941) and have been most recently reported on by\r\nDay _et al._ (1956). The seismic section of Day _et al._ (1956) (Fig.\r\n24) suggests that the prominent bench at 1600 fathoms and the short\r\nbut steep scarp just below represent the outcrop of the metamorphic\r\nbasement on the continental slope. It is postulated that the prominent\r\nbench at 900 fathoms may represent the base of the Mesozoic, and\r\nthe smaller bench at 300 fathoms the base of the Miocene. Tertiary\r\nsediments have been obtained from the walls of canyons in the Bay of\r\nBiscay in depths down to about 1500 fathoms (Bourcart and Marie, 1951).\r\nThe age assignments in Figure 24 are taken directly from Day _et al._\r\n(1956) and have not been confirmed by dredging on the continental slope.\r\n\r\nThe writers conclude that the majority of the topographic benches of\r\nthe continental slope and other category II provinces are structural\r\nbenches which reflect the outcrop of resistant rock layers. This of\r\ncourse implies that the continental slope is not a simple depositional\r\nfeature but a structural or erosional one. Since the structural benches\r\nare present both in the canyons and on the un-dissected slope, the\r\noccurrence of Tertiary and Cretaceous rocks on the continental slope\r\ncannot be explained by erosion of submarine canyons into an otherwise\r\ndepositional terrace in the manner implied by Stetson (1949).\r\n\r\nThe existence of such persistent benches implies that the entire width\r\nof the category II provinces must be at most only thinly covered by\r\nrecent sediments. Since the discovery of the great importance of\r\nturbidity currents and the relatively low slopes necessary for their\r\noccurrence, it has been a great puzzle to the writers how sediments\r\ncould be permanently deposited on the present continental slope. The\r\nanswer is simply that they are not. In addition to the turbidity\r\ncurrents which provide a mechanism for the seaward transport of\r\nsediment down the continental margin, deep-ocean currents probably sort\r\nand transport much sediment along a course parallel to the continental\r\nslope. It has recently been demonstrated (Swallow and Worthington,\r\n1957) that velocities of 10-20 cm/sec are attained by ocean currents\r\nwhich flow parallel to the continental slope. The particular\r\nmeasurement referred to was made at 1600 fathoms on the continental\r\nslope south of Cape Hatteras where a 17 cm/sec southward-moving current\r\nwas observed. The strong current is not a local phenomenon since it was\r\nfound in the South Atlantic by Wüst (1935) and is predicted by theories\r\nof ocean circulation (Stommel, 1957). Photographs of ripple marks\r\non the continental slope (See for instance Fig. 13 in Elmendorf and\r\nHeezen, 1957) had indicated high velocities, but it was not possible\r\nto distinguish between a current and an oscillatory origin. The total\r\neffect of slides, slumps, turbidity currents, and strong ocean-bottom\r\ncurrents is the removal of most of the unconsolidated Recent sediments\r\nfrom the continental slope.\r\n\r\nThe deposition of a series of Mesozoic and Tertiary sediments on the\r\nsubsiding margin of the continental block has produced a wedge of\r\nsedimentary rock largely of shallow marine facies. Each successive\r\nstrata laid down on the shelf was abruptly terminated at the shelf\r\nbreak by the processes of erosion which continuously or periodically\r\nclear the unconsolidated sediment from the continental slope.\r\nDeposition on the shelf was interrupted by several marine regressions\r\nwhich produced unconformities in the stratigraphic sequence. Nafe and\r\nDrake (1957) observed that the increase of seismic velocity with depth\r\nand therefore the increase in compaction with depth is more rapid on\r\nthe continental shelf than in the deep sea. This is probably in part\r\nthe result of erosion of previously deposited sediments and sedimentary\r\nrocks along the unconformities and in part the result of ground-water\r\ncementation during periods of emergence.\r\n\r\nEach unconformity should mark a lithologic change and consequently a\r\nchange in the resistance to erosion of the rock series. Many structural\r\nbenches may indicate surfaces of unconformity. The most recent\r\nunconformity in the sequence lies between the surface of the emerged\r\nWisconsin continental shelf and the overlying post-glacial shelf\r\nsediments.\r\n\r\nThe shelf break is defined as the most prominent break in slope between\r\nthe continental shelf and continental slope. The most prominent break\r\nmay locally be a Pliocene or Miocene structural bench, but elsewhere\r\nlate Pleistocene or Recent strata may form the shelf break. Rates of\r\nsubsidence, erosion, and sediment supply vary from place to place along\r\nthe continental shelf, and the lack of conformity either in depth or in\r\nage of the shelf break is thus easily explained.\r\n\r\nThe deeper structure of the continental margin indicates a fundamental\r\nstructural discontinuity at the base of the continental slope (category\r\nII provinces). It would seem a small extrapolation to attribute a\r\nfault origin to the continental slope. Although faulting may have\r\nplayed a large part in the earliest history of the category II\r\nprovinces, alternate periods of sedimentation and marine planation on\r\nthe continental shelf and long-continued erosion by slumps, turbidity\r\ncurrents, and deep-sea currents on the continental slope, together\r\nwith a general subsidence of the area, could have alone produced the\r\ncharacteristic form of the continental terrace.\r\n\r\nFurther work on structural benches co-ordinated with a study of ancient\r\nsediments from dredges and cores should enable us to draw a geologic\r\nmap of the continental slope of eastern United States and Europe\r\n(Heezen _et al._, in preparation).\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS OF CONTINENTAL MARGIN PHYSIOGRAPHIC PROVINCES\r\n\r\n_Seismicity of the continental-margin provinces._--Plate 29 shows the\r\ndistribution of epicenters in the North Atlantic. Except in the Puerto\r\nRico Trench and the adjacent Antilles Arc, earthquakes are exceedingly\r\nrare in the continental-margin provinces of the North Atlantic. From\r\nthe Bahamas through the Grand Banks the only earthquakes reported since\r\n1910 are two near the Laurentian Channel. In the eastern Atlantic an\r\nearthquake belt crosses the continental margin near Gibraltar but\r\ndoes not seem to be directly associated with the Atlantic continental\r\nmargins. If the continental slope in the area covered by Plate 29 is a\r\nfault scarp, we must infer that the motion has now been arrested.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Magnetic anomalies and continental-margin provinces._--The first\r\ncontinuously recorded total-intensity magnetic data for the Atlantic\r\nwere obtained in 1946 on a flight from Long Island, New York, to\r\nBermuda, and return (Keller _et al._, 1954). The first data from a\r\nship-towed magnetometer were obtained in 1948 (Heezen, Ewing, and\r\nMiller, 1953).\r\n\r\nThe initial measurements showed (1) several large (> 300γ) anomalies\r\non the continental shelf, (2) a large (> 500γ) anomaly over the\r\ncontinental slope, (3) an exceptionally smooth field over the category\r\nIII provinces, (4) rough fields with 5- to 15-mile wide 100 to 200γ\r\nanomalies over oceanic ridges and rises, (5) enormous anomalies (>\r\n1000γ) over seamounts and islands, and (6) large anomalies (> 500γ)\r\nover the crest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.\r\n\r\nThe large anomalies on the continental shelf were considered to\r\nindicate large volcanic cones buried by the sediments of the\r\ncontinental shelf (Miller and Ewing, 1956). The anomaly over the\r\ncontinental slope was considered to be the magnetic-edge effect\r\nassociated with the abrupt edge of the continental block. The rough\r\nfields over the oceanic rises and ridges were attributed to variations\r\nin the susceptibility of the crustal rocks, probably related to\r\nvolcanic extrusions and intrusions. The anomaly over the crest of\r\nthe Mid-Atlantic Ridge was not recognized as a general pattern until\r\nlater when many measurements were made. The major puzzle for which\r\nno explanation was readily obtained was the origin of the smooth\r\nfield over the continental rise. The smooth or quiet field has been\r\nobserved on each crossing of the category III provinces, and even\r\nsuch a sharp-sided feature as the Puerto Rico Trench failed to show a\r\nmagnetic anomaly (Davidson and Miller, 1956). We can thus state that\r\nall category III provinces are characterized by a smooth magnetic field.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this point is not yet clear, but it must be of\r\nmajor importance to the full understanding of the continental margin.\r\n\r\n_Crustal structure and continental-margin provinces._--Maurice Ewing\r\nand his associates have made more than 1000 seismic-refraction\r\nmeasurements to determine the crustal structure of continental margins.\r\nMost of the published results pertain to the eastern continental margin\r\nof the United States (Drake et al., in press), but much material will\r\nsoon be published on the continental margin of Sahara, Sierra Leone,\r\nBrazil, Argentina, Guiana, Spain, Morocco, the Gulf of Mexico, and the\r\nCaribbean Sea. In addition extensive work has been accomplished by\r\nBullard, Gaskell, and Hill in the western approaches to the English\r\nChannel. In some areas seismic, gravity, and magnetic measurements were\r\nmade along the same lines and have been subjected to an integrated\r\nanalysis (Worzel and Shurbet, 1955c).\r\n\r\nIn Plate 26 four profiles replotted from published sections are\r\nshown. Each profile is plotted at 40:1 exaggeration, and depths are\r\nindicated in fathoms and kilometers to facilitate comparison with\r\nthe profiles and topographic descriptions given elsewhere in this\r\npaper. Some stations which lie up to 100 miles from a profile have\r\nbeen projected along the strike of the topography. In general each\r\nprofile indicates (1) a thick lens of sediment and sedimentary rock\r\nbeneath the continental rise; (2) a major discontinuity in crustal\r\nstructure at the base of the continental slope; and (3) a wedge\r\nof low-velocity sedimentary rocks (\"unconsolidated\") overlying a\r\nlens of higher-velocity (\"semi-consolidated and consolidated\")\r\nsedimentary rocks beneath the continental shelf. The basin, filled\r\nwith higher-velocity sedimentary rocks, is formed by an upturned\r\nlip of crystalline basement rocks near the continental slope. Local\r\nvariations in thickness and velocity give rise to interesting minor\r\nconfigurations, but the basic structure is nearly identical in all the\r\nsections. The main contrast is that the category III provinces are\r\nunderlain by thick sedimentary rocks in the case of the continental\r\nrise, and successively thinner accumulations of sedimentary rock are\r\nassociated with the marginal basins and marginal trenches.\r\n\r\nSince the main difference in the continental-margin sections seems\r\nto be a greatly enhanced continental-rise sedimentary section to\r\nthe north as compared with the Blake Plateau--Bahama--Puerto Rico\r\nregion, it seems reasonable to conclude that the main difference in\r\nthe topography is the result of different sedimentation rates or a\r\ndifferent time of origin, rather than of a vastly different structural\r\norigin. The sedimentary rock column beneath the continental rise is\r\ntruly geosynclinal in thickness. Whether this great lens of sediment\r\nand sedimentary rock will eventually be deformed into a mountain range\r\nto form a new addition to the continent as advocated by the accretion\r\nschool or whether it will lie forever on the sea floor is one of the\r\ngreat speculations of geology.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Sediment distribution and physiographic provinces of the continental\r\nmargin._ The recent sediments of the category I provinces are largely\r\nsands, silts, silty lutites, and carbonates (Stetson, 1938; Shepard\r\nand Cohee, 1936; Newell, 1955). All these sediments can be assigned to\r\nthe orthoquartzite suite of Pettijohn (1957). Judging from the ancient\r\nsediments dredged from the continental slope and obtained by drilling,\r\nthe category I provinces have been receiving orthoquartzite sediments\r\nat least since the Cretaceous. In category II provinces Recent\r\nsediments are either lacking or are very thin. Those Recent sediments\r\nwhich temporarily remain in the province range from foraminiferal\r\nlutites, found in such areas as the Bahamas, to silty lutites\r\nrelatively poor in pelagic fossils, found in the higher latitudes. In\r\ngeneral category II provinces are characterized by nondeposition or\r\nerosion.\r\n\r\nThe sediments of the category III provinces include both pelagic\r\nand clastic terrigenous sediments. The outer ridge is covered by\r\n_Globigerina_ ooze in depths shallower than about 2200 fathoms and by\r\nred clay in deeper areas. The continental rise is generally covered\r\nby silty foraminiferal lutites, but, where submarine canyon deltas\r\nspread out from the mouths of submarine canyons (Ericson _et al._,\r\n1951, 1952), beds of graded sand and silts from a few centimeters\r\nto a few meters in thickness are interbedded with lutites. In the\r\nmarginal trenches and marginal basins graded calcareous sands alternate\r\nwith low-carbonate lutites. The category III provinces of northwest\r\nAfrica are dominated by two groups of volcanic islands and seamounts\r\nwhich contribute flows and volcanic detritus to the continental-rise\r\nsediments. In general the category III provinces are dominated by\r\nsediments ascribable to the graywacke suite of Pettijohn (1957).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Past, present, and future of continental-margin physiographic\r\nprovinces._--It takes only a little imagination to see a historical\r\nor genetic sequence in the four profiles of Plate 26. The Puerto Rico\r\nTrench--outer-ridge profiles thus may represent a continental margin in\r\nyouth, the Blake--Bahama--outer-ridge profile a margin in late youth or\r\nearly maturity, and Newfoundland and northeast United States profiles a\r\nmargin in late maturity or old age.\r\n\r\nThe lens of sediments that has filled the marginal trench off\r\nnortheastern United States is truly geosynclinal in thickness (Drake\r\n_et al._, in press). The sediments of the shelf lens are similar in\r\nlithology to the orthoquartzite suite of a mio-geosyncline (cf. Kay,\r\n1951), and the thicker continental-rise lens is probably similar in\r\nlithology to the graywacke-volcanic suite of a eugeosyncline. (Kay,\r\n1951). It seems virtually certain that ancient orthogeosynclines were,\r\nbefore deformation, closely analogous to the continental margins. The\r\nmajor problem is completing the sequence from filled geosyncline to\r\nfolded mountains is the mechanism by which the earth's crust beneath\r\nthe geosyncline thickens by 20-30 km. Although we cannot predict the\r\nfuture of the present continental margin with any assurance until the\r\nmechanism of thickening is understood, it seems probable that before\r\ndeformation the older orthogeosynclines were similar in most details to\r\nthe modern continental margins.\r\n\r\nIt seems possible that the present continental margins will in some\r\nfuture geological period be uplifted into folded mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOCEAN-BASIN FLOOR\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe second of the three basic topographic divisions of the oceanic\r\ndepression is the ocean-basin floor. Included in this division are\r\nthose provinces of the oceanic depression that are not included in the\r\ncontinental margin or the mid-oceanic ridge.\r\n\r\nThe ocean-basin floor is divided into three categories: (1) abyssal\r\nfloor, (2) oceanic rises, and (3) seamounts and seamount groups. The\r\nfirst category includes two types of provinces, abyssal plains and\r\nabyssal hills, which occupy the deepest portion of the ocean-basin\r\nfloor. Included in these provinces are such features as abyssal\r\ngaps and mid-ocean canyons. The second category includes the larger\r\npositive features of the ocean-basin floor, and the large seamounts and\r\nseamount groups fall in the third category. The landward limit of the\r\nocean-basin floor is the 1:1000 gradient isopleth along the continental\r\nmargin. Along the mid-oceanic ridge the boundary is taken as that scarp\r\nor scarp zone where the average level rises appreciably above the axis\r\nof maximum depth of the basin floor. Broad elevations which rise above\r\nthe basin floor as isolated rises are termed oceanic rises and are\r\nincluded in this discussion even though they may be structurally more\r\nclosely related to the mid-oceanic ridge or the continental margin.\r\n\r\n\r\nABYSSAL PLAINS\r\n\r\n_General discussion._--An abyssal plain has been defined (Heezen,\r\nEwing, and Ericson, 1954) as \"an area of the deep-ocean floor in which\r\nthe ocean bottom is flat and the slope of the bottom is less than\r\n1:1000\".\r\n\r\nAbyssal plains have been found in all oceans, characteristically at the\r\nfoot of the continental rise. Koczy (1954; 1956) and Gaskell and Ashton\r\n(1954) have described the abyssal plain south of the Bay of Bengal.\r\nKoczy (1956) has described plains in the equatorial Atlantic on either\r\nside of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. On Expedition Deep Freeze workers\r\non the USS GLACIER, using a PDR, discovered an abyssal plain in the\r\nWeddell Sea. Workers on the R. V. VEMA in 1957 confirmed the existence\r\nof abyssal plains in the Argentine and in the Cape and Angola basins\r\nof the South Atlantic. Menard (1955) has described abyssal plains off\r\nthe California and Alaska coasts. Abyssal plains are really important\r\nand are present off all coasts except those having a long, continuous,\r\nunfilled marginal trench.\r\n\r\nThe abyssal plains shown on the physiographic diagram have been named\r\nin order to facilitate referencing. The abyssal plains of the western\r\nAtlantic between Newfoundland and the West Indies are best known. The\r\n\"abyssal plain south of Newfoundland\" (Heezen _et al._, 1954) has been\r\nnamed the Sohm Abyssal Plain following the usage of Murray (1912) who\r\nreferred to this area as \"Sohm Deep\" in several publications. The\r\nabyssal plain south of the Bermuda Rise referred to as the \"abyssal\r\nplain in the Nares Basin\" (Heezen, Ewing, and Menzies, 1955; Luskin et\r\nal., 1954) is named on the province chart (Pl. 20) the Nares Abyssal\r\nPlain, also following the usage of Murray (1912), who named this area\r\nthe Nares Deep. The abyssal plain southwest of the Bermuda Rise was\r\nincluded in the Nares Abyssal Plain until the discovery in 1955 that\r\nthe two parts were separated by a steep abyssal gap at 24° N. 68° W.\r\nnecessitated the splitting off of this plain from the Nares Abyssal\r\nPlain. The name Hatteras Abyssal Plain used on the map was suggested by\r\nthe close proximity of the very prominent Cape Hatteras.\r\n\r\nAn abyssal plain is probably present in the Newfoundland basin, but no\r\nPDR soundings have been obtained in that area. The name Newfoundland\r\nAbyssal Plain is suggested subject to confirmation by a precision\r\nsurvey.\r\n\r\nThe outer ridge which runs south from Cape Hatteras paralleling the\r\ncoast lines of the Bahamas encloses the Blake-Bahama Basin (Ericson,\r\nEwing, and Heezen, 1952); a narrow abyssal plain is found along its\r\nwestern margin. This plain is named the Blake-Bahama Abyssal Plain.\r\n\r\nBetween the Greater Antilles and the Bahama Banks is a depression\r\ncalled the Old Bahama Channel in the north; farther south it is known\r\nas the Hispaniola-Caicos Channel. The Hispaniola-Caicos Channel in\r\nparticular contains an abyssal plain which, although much smaller\r\nthan the large, deep-sea abyssal plains, has all the characteristics\r\nof slope flatness and sediment composition. This is called the\r\nHispaniola-Caicos Abyssal Plain.\r\n\r\nThe smallest, yet perhaps the most striking, Atlantic abyssal plains\r\nare those at the bottom of the Puerto Rico Trench at depths of about\r\n4358 fathoms (4585 corrected). They exhibit the proper degree of\r\nflatness, low gradient (Ewing and Heezen, 1955), and the shallow-water\r\nclastic sediments typical of abyssal plains.\r\n\r\nSouth of Cuba in the southwest corner of the diagram lies a major\r\ndeep-sea trench. Only the eastern end of this Cayman Trench is shown\r\nin the diagram. On the floor of this steep-walled trench lies a narrow\r\ntrench plain or system of semi-connected trench plains which lie at\r\ndepths of about 3000 fathoms south of Guantanamo, Cuba, but deepen to\r\n3692 fathoms south of the Cayman Islands. These are known as the Cayman\r\nTrench Plains. This area will be described in more detail in a later\r\npublication devoted to the topography of the Caribbean.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern Atlantic each abyssal plain has been crossed at least\r\nthree times by ships employing a PDR, a coverage which, although\r\nsufficient to establish their existence, is vastly inferior to the\r\ncoverage of the western Atlantic abyssal plains. The Biscay Abyssal\r\nPlain occupies a large portion of the Bay of Biscay. It is connected\r\nby an abyssal gap at 43° 30´N., 12° 00´W., to the Iberia Abyssal Plain\r\nwhich lies west of the northern two-thirds of the Iberian Peninsula. A\r\nsmall abyssal plain west of the Tagus River takes its name from this\r\nriver. The great abyssal plain which skirts Madeira on the east and\r\nsouth and extends over a vast area to the west is referred to as the\r\nMadeira Abyssal Plain. The Canary Islands and associated banks form\r\nthe boundaries of a small oval depression known as the Canary Abyssal\r\nPlain. The vast abyssal plain which skirts the African continent west\r\nof Cape Verde is named the Cape Verde Abyssal Plain.\r\n\r\nThe eastern margin of the map just reaches the abyssal plain in the\r\nwestern Mediterranean which Heezen and Ewing (1955) have named the\r\nBalearic Abyssal Plain.\r\n\r\nAbyssal plains were not discovered until the use of continuously\r\nrecording echo sounders was extended to abyssal depths following\r\nWorld War II (Tolstoy and Ewing, 1949). While the early nonprecision\r\necho sounders were sometimes adequate to distinguish the limits\r\nof particular plains, real advances in their study required the\r\ndevelopment of precision sounders and the extensive use thereof\r\n(Heezen, Ewing, and Ericson, 1954). Since the very existence of abyssal\r\nplains has been known for less than 10 years and only recently have any\r\nof them been adequately delineated, the problem of their nomenclature\r\nhas never before arisen.\r\n\r\nIn the cases of the Nares and Sohm abyssal plains we have taken the\r\nname Murray has given to the \"deeps\" in which the plains occur. For\r\nCape Verde, Iberia, and Newfoundland abyssal plains we have followed\r\nthe name Wüst (1940b) proposed for the basin within which the plains\r\nlie. The Biscay, Tagus, Hatteras, Blake-Bahama, Hispaniola-Caicos, and\r\nBalearic have been given the name of a prominent near-by land area, in\r\naccordance with recognized practice. The Horseshoe Abyssal Plain takes\r\nits name from the horseshoe-shaped line of seamounts which surrounds it\r\nexcept on the eastern side.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Regional description._--The relief of the abyssal plains is so low\r\nthat ordinary small-scale exaggerated profiles (Pls. 22, 27) reveal\r\nnothing of its detailed character. In a few areas exceptionally good\r\nPDR records have been obtained which show relief of a few feet (Pl. 12).\r\n\r\nSOHM ABYSSAL PLAIN: The best-studied abyssal plain is the Sohm Abyssal\r\nPlain south of Newfoundland. In addition to the 1953 VEMA PDR survey\r\n(Heezen _et al._, 1954) the area was studied extensively in 1955 and\r\ncrossed by the trans-Atlantic cruises of 1954 and 1956. The plain is\r\nT-shaped and generally about 200 miles wide; depths range from 2700 to\r\n3000 fathoms (uncorrected). The depth increases in each arm of the T\r\ntoward the stem where the slope changes to south. The greatest depth is\r\nfound at the south boundary of the plain near 29° N. In the northern\r\npart of the plain small topographic irregularities are unknown, but\r\ntoward the south peaks 50 to 500 fathoms high increase in number until\r\nthey finally replace the plain. North of the Bermuda Rise the plain\r\nsurrounds a line of huge seamounts. However, even here no small hills\r\nare found. In the strip extending between 30° and 37° N., the east and\r\nwest boundaries of the plain are formed by scarps 200 to 800 fathoms\r\nhigh. The boundary on the north side of the Bermuda Rise is formed by a\r\ndistinct shallowing, but no scarp is seen.\r\n\r\nThere is some justification for separating the northwest arm of the\r\nSohm Abyssal Plain north of the Bermuda Rise from the rest of the Sohm\r\nAbyssal Plain since a mid-ocean canyon runs from the northwest to the\r\ncentral sections of the plain. A sill might lie northeast of the\r\nnortheast tip of the Bermuda Rise. Here the bottom gradient changes\r\nslightly, and an extremely large magnetic anomaly is associated with\r\nthe region. However, the plain narrows only slightly at this point,\r\nand, since we cannot tell how many individual basins were filled\r\nto form an abyssal plain, we will consider that the Sohm Plain now\r\nincludes the whole area, keeping in mind that the northwest arm may\r\nhave only recently merged with the rest.\r\n\r\nSouth of Newfoundland the continental rise merges with the abyssal\r\nplain with no scarp or line of hills. Here the boundary is taken at\r\nthe point where the gradient is gentler than 1:1000. This is not an\r\nentirely arbitrary definition since an appreciable change in gradient\r\ngenerally occurs near this point. South of the boundary the gradient\r\ngradually decreases to 1:3000 at 37° N., beyond which it decreases even\r\nmore gradually and reaches 1:5000 at the southern edge of the plain.\r\n\r\nHATTERAS ABYSSAL PLAIN: Northeast of the Bermuda Rise on a line between\r\nLong Island (N. Y.) and Bermuda a small area of abyssal hills lies\r\nbetween the continental rise on the northwest, the Bermuda Rise on the\r\nsoutheast, the Sohm Abyssal Plain on the northeast, and the Hatteras\r\nAbyssal Plain on the southwest. Although this area has been traversed\r\nby more tracks than any area of similar size in the Atlantic, the\r\nrelationships here are still somewhat obscure. This area of some 6000\r\nsquare miles is one of irregular relief, but it is not known if it\r\nis of the character of an irregular sill or a complex abyssal gap,\r\nalthough the latter seems more probable. The northwest margin of the\r\nHatteras Abyssal Plain is abruptly formed by the lower continental\r\nrise hills. The eastern boundary is generally distinct and in places\r\nis formed by a 50- or 100-fathom scarp, but generally it is not so\r\nimpressive as the east and west boundaries of the Sohm Abyssal Plain.\r\nSouth of about 34° N., the western boundary of the Hatteras Abyssal\r\nPlain is formed by the outer ridge. In some sectors the eastern flank\r\nof the outer ridge is rather gentle, and the abyssal plain gently laps\r\nthe ridge without a sharp break. This boundary is generally sharp north\r\nof 27° N. but to the south is less definite. The Hatteras Plain slopes\r\nsoutheast to about 31° N. where the direction of slope changes to\r\nsouth. A gradient of about 1:3000 and depths of about 2900 fathoms are\r\nreached at 25° N. Within about 60 miles of Vema Gap the plain is broken\r\nby numerous mid-ocean canyons which converge on the gap (Pl. 14, fig.\r\n3). The Hatteras Abyssal Plain has no known seamounts or sea knolls, in\r\ncontrast to the Sohm Abyssal Plain and Nares Abyssal Plain.\r\n\r\nThe sediments of the Hatteras Abyssal Plain resemble the northern\r\nabyssal plains in having many beds of quartz silts (Pl. 28) and\r\ncontrast sharply with the Blake-Bahama Abyssal Plain where calcareous\r\nsands are abundant. On the west the outer ridge forms a continuous\r\nbarrier to turbidity-current sediments coming from the near-by Bahamas\r\nso that the only source of turbidity-current sediments is from the Cape\r\nHatteras region to the north or possibly from the Hudson Canyon via the\r\nsuspected abyssal gap mentioned above. The type of sediment is entirely\r\nconsistent with the gradient of the plain which slopes southward from\r\nthe Hatteras region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                                 Heezen _et al._, PL. 14\r\n\r\nFIGURE 1.

A narrow abyssal\r\nplain 20 to 70 miles wide spreads out from the base of the escarpment\r\n(Pl. 5, fig. 3). The plain is shallowest and widest just east of\r\nthe Northeast Providence Channel and deepens and narrows toward its\r\nnorthern and southern ends. Sediment cores taken 60 miles off the mouth\r\nof Northeast Providence Channel contained graded beds of calcareous\r\nsand a few meters thick (Ericson _et al._, 1952). The material was\r\nobviously derived from the Bahamas, presumably through the action of\r\nturbidity currents running out through the Providence Channels, the\r\nsouthern entrance of Exuma Sound, and the numerous submarine canyons\r\nwhich dissect the slopes off the islands. The depth of the plain ranges\r\nfrom 2600 to 2750 fathoms, and its area is about 7000 square miles.\r\n\r\nNARES ABYSSAL PLAIN: South and southeast of the Bermuda Rise lies the\r\nNares Plain, a 37,000-square-mile abyssal plain that slopes eastward\r\nfrom Vema Gap toward the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. From 62° to 64° W. its\r\nnorthern and southern boundaries are abrupt, and only three or four\r\nsmall abyssal hills have been observed in the plain. East of 64° W.\r\nthe gradient of the plain exceeds 1:2500, and the frequency of hills\r\nincreases until at 61° W. the plain consists of a series of fingers\r\nwhich extend into the abyssal hills. The sediment cores obtained in\r\nthe Nares Abyssal Plain consist of alternating red clays and quartz\r\nsilts (Ericson _et al._, 1952; in press). The Nares Abyssal Plain is\r\nthe deepest of the broad abyssal plains of the ocean-basin floor. It\r\nis also the farthest from the land. If the turbidity currents smoothed\r\nthe Nares Plain they would all have had to flow through Vema Gap\r\nsince the outer ridge-trench complex to the south prevents currents\r\nfrom this area from reaching the Nares Abyssal Plain. The idea of a\r\nroute through Vema Gap is supported by the fact that the plain slopes\r\neastward from the gap.\r\n\r\nHISPANIOLA-CAICOS ABYSSAL PLAIN: The depression between the Bahamas and\r\nthe coasts of Cuba and Hispaniola deepens east of Cay Lobos and reaches\r\nits maximum depth of 2220 fathoms northwest of Cape Francis Viejo of\r\nHispaniola. At Cay Lobos the channel is a steep V-shaped depression\r\nwith a maximum depth of 400 fathoms, but to the east this V-shaped\r\nchannel opens out to an abyssal plain about 1500 fathoms deep. Between\r\nthis point and Great Inagua Island the flat floor slopes east reaching\r\na depth of 1575 fathoms just southwest of Inagua. This portion is\r\ncalled the Old Bahama Abyssal Plain. South of Great Inagua is another\r\nV-shaped channel in which the depth drops from 1700 fathoms on the west\r\nto 2200 fathoms on the east. From this point to Cape Francis Viejo the\r\nHispaniola-Caicos Abyssal Plain is nearly flat. Sediments collected\r\nfrom this plain confirmed the turbidity-current origin of the smooth\r\ntopography. The cores contained plant debris, shallow-water fossils,\r\nand a variety of reworked older material (Ericson, Ewing, and Heezen,\r\n1952; Ewing and Heezen, 1955; Ericson _et al._, 1955).\r\n\r\nPUERTO RICO TRENCH (ABYSSAL) PLAINS: A trench plain is an abyssal\r\nplain in the bottom of a deep-sea trench. Since the discovery of the\r\nPuerto Rico Trench (Abyssal) Plains similar features have been reported\r\nfor the Middle America Trench (Fisher, 1954), the Kurile-Kamchatka\r\nTrench (Udintsev, 1955), and the Peru-Chile Trench (Zeigler, 1958).\r\nTwo trench plains are known from the Puerto Rico Trench. The smaller\r\none occupies a basin south of a median ridge, and the larger one lies\r\nalong the deep axis of the trench. They range in width from 1-2 miles\r\nto about 12 miles. Sediment cores taken in the trench plain contained\r\nbeds of graded calcareous sand containing fragments of _Halimeda_ and\r\nshallow benthic Foraminifera (Ericson, Ewing, and Heezen, 1952). The\r\ndepth of the larger trench plain ranges only slightly from 4358 fathoms\r\n(4585 fathoms corrected). The trench shallows eastward, and the plains\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nCAYMAN TRENCH (ABYSSAL) PLAINS: The Cayman Trench contains trench\r\nplains very similar to those in the Puerto Rico Trench. The limits of\r\nthe Cayman Trench Plains shown on the physiographic diagram may not be\r\ntoo reliable; it has not been redrafted since the most recent tracks\r\nshown on the track chart were obtained.\r\n\r\nBISCAY ABYSSAL PLAIN: The Bay of Biscay is occupied by a large abyssal\r\nplain which begins a few miles north of the northern limit of the map\r\nand ends at the Theta Gap at 43° 30´N. The plain ranges from 2550 to\r\n2650 fathoms in depth and is about 200 miles wide. Cores of graded\r\nsand and silt have been obtained from the floor of the plain. Several\r\nmid-ocean canyons 3 to 5 fathoms deep and a quarter of a mile to 2\r\nmiles wide have been observed in the plain (Pl. 8), but data are not\r\nsufficient to determine their exact courses. It is suggested that they\r\nconverge on Theta Gap and that some may be extensions of submarine\r\ncanyons of the continental slope.\r\n\r\nIBERIA ABYSSAL PLAIN: South of Theta Gap and west of the northern third\r\nof the Iberian Peninsula lies an oval abyssal plain of about 25,000\r\nsquare miles. The depth of this plain ranges from 2770 fathoms near\r\nTheta Gap and at the base of the continental rise to 2820 fathoms near\r\nthe eastern margin of the abyssal hills province. The plain fans out\r\nfrom Theta Gap and gradually merges with the normal westward slope from\r\nthe continental rise of north Iberia.\r\n\r\nTAGUS ABYSSAL PLAIN: West of the canyons off the mouth of the Tagus\r\nlies a small circular plain of 7100 square miles. Its depth ranges from\r\n2650 to 2700 fathoms, and it slopes westward with slightly fan-shaped\r\ncontours extending from the mouths of the two large canyons. A recent\r\nsediment sampling campaign revealed numerous graded silt and sand\r\nlayers in the plain (Pl. 28).\r\n\r\nHORSESHOE ABYSSAL PLAIN: A small abyssal plain of 5200 square miles\r\nlies in the center of a horseshoe-shaped ring of seamounts, just west\r\nof Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nMADEIRA AND CAPE VERDE ABYSSAL PLAINS: From Gibraltar to Cape Verde and\r\nextending southward to the Sierra Leone Rise at 10° N. a vast abyssal\r\nplain parallels the coast of Africa. For most of its length the western\r\nboundary of this plain is 750 miles from the coast. The average width\r\nof the plain is 200 miles, and it occasionally reaches 300 miles. An\r\neastward extension of the abyssal hills approaches within 200 miles of\r\nthe Canary Islands, forming a natural constriction which divides the\r\nplain into a northern part, the Madeira Abyssal Plain, and a southern\r\npart, the Cape Verde Abyssal Plain.\r\n\r\nThe Madeira Abyssal Plain occupies 150,000 square miles. The\r\nAzores-Gibraltar Ridge forms its northern boundary, and the abyssal\r\nhills its western boundary. Depths near the seaward limit of the plain\r\nreach 2970 fathoms. The northern part of the Madeira Plain is broken\r\nby a series of low scarps (Pl. 13, fig. 3). The gradient of the plain\r\nbetween successive scarps is about 1:1500.\r\n\r\nThe Cape Verde Abyssal Plain occupies 200,000 square miles of sea floor\r\n(Pl. 9, fig. 3). The transition from abyssal plain to abyssal hills is\r\ngradual. Many hills are scattered in the plain near the boundary. Small\r\nscarps of the kind observed in the Madeira Abyssal Plain have not been\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nRecent soundings southwest of Madeira indicate that a low topographic\r\nfeature which might be called the Madeira Rise continues into the\r\nnortheast part of the area shown as Madeira Abyssal Plain. This abyssal\r\nplain is thus somewhat smaller than indicated in the drawings. Two PDR\r\nrecords from this rise area are illustrated (Pl. 13, figs. 1, 2). Since\r\nthe limits of the Madeira Abyssal Plain are based on only four sounding\r\nprofiles, future surveys will cause relatively great changes in this\r\nportion of the diagram.\r\n\r\n\r\nABYSSAL HILLS\r\n\r\n_Definition and distribution._--An abyssal hill is a small hill that\r\nrises from the ocean-basin floor and is from a few fathoms to a few\r\nhundred fathoms in height and from a few hundred feet to a few miles\r\nin width. The term abyssal hills province is applied to those areas of\r\nthe ocean-basin floor in which nearly the entire area is occupied by\r\nhills--that is, the province lies at approximately the depth of the\r\nadjacent abyssal plain but lacks a smooth floor. Isolated abyssal hills\r\nand groups of abyssal hills also occur in the abyssal plains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 25.--_Index chart, location of abyssal hills\r\nprofiles illustrated in Figures 26 and 27_\r\n\r\nLimits of abyssal hills provinces shown by dotted lines.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 26.--_Eleven profiles, Western Atlantic Abyssal\r\nHills Province_\r\n\r\n40:1 vertical exaggeration; positions shown on Figure 25.]\r\n\r\nAbyssal hills are found along the seaward margin of most abyssal plains\r\nand probably occur in profusion in basins isolated from adjacent land\r\nareas by ridges, rises, or trenches. In the North Atlantic the abyssal\r\nhills form two strips parallel to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge for virtually\r\nits entire length. The Bermuda Rise is bordered on the southeast by\r\nabyssal hills which join with the strips adjoining the Mid-Atlantic\r\nRidge (Fig. 25). Southeast of the Bermuda Rise the abyssal plain is\r\nabsent, and consequently the Western Atlantic Abyssal-Hills Province\r\nexceeds 500 miles in width.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 27.--_Eight profiles, Eastern Atlantic Abyssal\r\nHills Province_\r\n\r\nVertical exaggeration 40:1; positions shown on Figure 25.]\r\n\r\nIn the North Atlantic the axes of maximum depth on the eastern and on\r\nthe western sides of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge lie in the abyssal-hills\r\nprovince. This pattern probably continues through the South Atlantic,\r\nIndian Ocean, and South Pacific oceans. Individual abyssal hills\r\nare identical to the smaller hills which rise from the steps of the\r\nMid-Atlantic Ridge and are probably of the same origin. The abyssal\r\nhills and the Lower Step of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge can be distinguished\r\ntopographically only by the contrast in level.\r\n\r\n_Regional description._--The abyssal hills within the area of the\r\nphysiographic diagram are illustrated by profiles WH-1-11 and EH-1-8\r\nreproduced in Figures 26 and 27 respectively.\r\n\r\nWESTERN ATLANTIC: The abyssal-hills province ranges from a few miles\r\nto more than 125 miles in width from the north edge of the map to the\r\nSoutheast Newfoundland Ridge. Along profile WH-1 the province consists\r\nof about a dozen hills 3-4 miles wide and 50-100 fathoms high, while\r\nin WH-2 the hills are 4-10 miles in width, and some exceed 200 fathoms\r\nin height. The abyssal-hills province appears to pinch out at the\r\nSoutheast Newfoundland Ridge. Southwest of the Southeast Newfoundland\r\nRidge the abyssal hills form a belt 60-120 miles wide which skirts\r\nalong the north edge of Corner Rise. In this area, as illustrated by\r\nWH-3, -4, and -5, the largest abyssal hills nowhere exceed 250 fathoms\r\nin height. The individual hills range from 3 to 12 miles wide; maximum\r\ndepths between individual hills frequently exceed the depth of the\r\nadjacent abyssal plain by 50-100 fathoms.\r\n\r\nAlong the northwest corner of Corner Rise the abyssal-hills province\r\npinches out. South of Corner Rise the province appears on both the east\r\nand the west sides of the Sohm Abyssal Plain, and isolated abyssal\r\nhills become more numerous within the abyssal plain. In profile WH-6\r\nthe abyssal hills within the province reach 300 fathoms in height and\r\nare 3-5 miles wide. A few higher peaks occur such as the two in profile\r\nWH-6, one 500 fathoms high and 20 miles wide and the other 700 fathoms\r\nhigh and 15 miles wide. In addition eight isolated hills 100 to 175\r\nfathoms high rise from the plain in the same profile. To the south, the\r\nfrequency of hills within the plain increases, and the hills province\r\nwidens. In profile WH-7 the province increases to 35 miles in width\r\non the east side of the Sohm Plain and to 100 miles in width on the\r\nwest side. The smaller individual hills in the plain are 200 fathoms\r\nhigh, in contrast to the average of 100 fathoms in WH-6. Twenty-one\r\nindividual hills rise from the plain in WH-7, in contrast to 15 in\r\nWH-6. In WH-8 the abyssal plain is represented by a flat-floored valley\r\nonly 12 miles wide; the remaining 500-mile width of the abyssal floor\r\nis occupied by abyssal hills. Individual hills are 300 to 600 fathoms\r\nhigh and 5 to 10 miles wide (Fig. 28; Pl. 10). If we filled all the\r\ndepressions on WH-8 with 100 fathoms of sediments the profile would\r\nclosely resemble WH-7.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 28.--_Tracing of PDR record, abyssal hills,\r\nsoutheast of Bermuda Rise_] WH-9 and WH-10 are very similar to WH-8\r\nexcept that individual hills seem to become broader and lower toward\r\nthe south. The height of individual hills in WH-10 ranges from 100 to\r\n250 fathoms. South of WH-8 the abyssal-hill province splits into two\r\nstrips which border the Nares Abyssal Plain. The western strip lies\r\nbelow the eastern scarp of the Bermuda Rise Scarp Zone, and the eastern\r\nstrip follows the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, sending a narrow strip westward\r\nalong the northern edge of the outer ridge north of Puerto Rico. A\r\nnumber of hills 50 fathoms high and 2-5 miles wide are scattered over\r\nthe eastern part of the Nares Abyssal Plain. Abyssal hills are rare\r\nin the abyssal plain west of 65° W. The abyssal-hill province along\r\nthe southwestern Bermuda Rise is extremely narrow and intermittent. No\r\nabyssal hills have been recorded for the Hatteras Abyssal Plain, and\r\nonly locally is the province developed along the western side of the\r\nBermuda Rise. Locally abyssal hills are moderately well developed along\r\nthe northern margin of the Bermuda Rise.\r\n\r\nEASTERN ATLANTIC: The abyssal floor west of the Anglo-French shelf is\r\nextremely narrow; the abyssal plain and abyssal hills combined are only\r\n80 miles wide. The abyssal-hills province is absent, but, as shown on\r\nEH-1 and EH-2 (Fig. 27), large hills rise from the seaward edge of\r\nthe Biscay Abyssal Plain. These hills are 5-10 miles wide and 100-400\r\nfathoms high. West of the Iberia Abyssal Plain (EH-3) the abyssal-hills\r\nprovince is wider and better developed than near the Biscay Abyssal\r\nPlain.\r\n\r\nSouth of Gibraltar the abyssal floor widens southward; northwest of\r\nCape Verde it is more than 200 miles wide. Profile EH-6 runs obliquely\r\nthrough the province and indicates an exaggerated width for the\r\nprovince. Individual hills are 5-10 miles wide and 100-600 fathoms high\r\n(Pl. 9, fig. 4). The abyssal-hills province is widest, and the hills\r\nare the highest where the depth is greatest, a relation similar to that\r\nobserved on the opposite side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the sector\r\nsoutheast of the Bermuda Rise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Origin of abyssal-hills topography._--The topography of the abyssal\r\nhills is considered to represent the original surface buried beneath\r\nthe abyssal plains and perhaps beneath the continental rise.\r\nThis explanation agrees well with the smooth topography and the\r\ndistribution of deep-sea sands in the abyssal plain. The origin of\r\nthe hills topography is a more difficult problem. We have no rock\r\nsamples from these provinces. Individual hills cannot be studied with\r\npresent seismic-refraction techniques; they do not seem to have a\r\ncharacteristic magnetic anomaly; and Worzel has only recently developed\r\na method of gravity measurement which can be applied to a feature as\r\nsmall as an abyssal hill. At present we have only topography as a basis\r\nof speculation of their origin. As far as we know, individual abyssal\r\nhills are not discernibly different from the smaller hills of the steps\r\nof the Mid-Atlantic Ridge or much of the topography of the oceanic\r\nrises, and thus there is no reason to assume that the abyssal hills\r\nhave a different origin.\r\n\r\nWe have noted that abyssal hills range from 50 to 600 fathoms in height\r\nand with some exceptions from 4 to 10 miles in width. However, many\r\nof the hills are about 200 fathoms high and 5 miles wide. The hills\r\nare very steep-sided, and frequently the sounder simply records a\r\nseries of \"highlights\" from a succession of peaks (Pl. 10; Pl. 9, fig.\r\n4). Soundings are difficult to obtain in the abyssal-hills provinces\r\nbecause of the great depth and primarily the preponderance of steep\r\nslopes (Pl. 10). We do not know whether individual hills are conical\r\nor elongate or, in fact, if they run in narrow, sinuous ridges as\r\nsuggested by Tolstoy (1951). Accurate, detailed mapping of portions\r\nof the abyssal-hills provinces on scales of approximately 1:20,000\r\nor larger should provide additional limits on theories of origin.\r\nAt present we cannot decide among vulcanism, faulting, or folding,\r\nalthough folding seems the least probable.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER MAJOR FEATURES OF THE ABYSSAL FLOOR\r\n\r\n_Abyssal gaps._--If two adjacent but distinct abyssal plains have\r\nno through passage at or below the level of the higher plain, they\r\nare said to be separated by a sill, a ridge, or a rise, depending on\r\nthe dimensions of the feature involved. However, several plains are\r\nconnected by constricted passages.\r\n\r\nAn abyssal gap is a constricted passage connecting two abyssal plains\r\nwhich, in the vicinity of the gap, lie at different levels. The sea\r\nfloor slopes down continuously through the gap from the higher to the\r\nlower abyssal plain, at a gradient considerably greater than that of\r\neither adjacent abyssal plain.\r\n\r\nProminent abyssal gaps are known in the western North Atlantic (Vema\r\nGap) and in the eastern North Atlantic (Theta Gap). An abyssal gap\r\nconnects the Colombia and Venezuela abyssal plains of the Caribbean.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Mid-ocean canyons._--Whereas most submarine canyons are furrows cut\r\ninto the continental-margin provinces, a class of canyon is found in\r\nthe abyssal plains, generally associated with abyssal gaps.\r\n\r\nA mid-ocean canyon is a steep-walled, flat-floored persistent linear\r\ndepression, 1-5 miles wide and a few to more than 100 fathoms deep,\r\nwhich occurs in an abyssal plain.\r\n\r\nEach mid-ocean canyon discovered in the North Atlantic leads to an\r\nabyssal gap in a manner which suggests a genetic relationship. All\r\nrecognized mid-ocean canyons parallel the adjacent continental margin.\r\nAlthough all slope downward continuously they cut across the regional\r\nslope of the abyssal plain.\r\n\r\nMid-ocean canyons or features resembling them have been found in the\r\nIndian Ocean Bay of Bengal (Dietz, 1953), in the northwest Atlantic\r\n(Ewing _et al._, 1953), the western Atlantic, and the equatorial\r\nAtlantic (Beckmann, in preparation). Gibson (1958) has reported one\r\nin the Gulf of Alaska. Three in the Atlantic and one in the Gulf of\r\nAlaska have been mapped. Although mid-ocean canyons probably join with\r\ncontinental-margin submarine canyons, no such connection has been\r\nmapped. Menard (1955) has recorded from the North Pacific several\r\ncrossings of features resembling the mid-ocean canyons of the Atlantic,\r\nwhich he refers to as deep-sea channels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Regional description._--Abyssal gaps and mid-ocean canyons are found\r\nin both the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 29.--_Northwest Atlantic Mid-Ocean Canyon_\r\n\r\nSurveyed positions and extensions; generalized bathymetry simplified\r\nfrom Smith, Soule, and Mosby (1937)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 30.--_Eight east-west profiles showing Northwest\r\nAtlantic Mid-Ocean Canyon_\r\n\r\nSoundings obtained with NMC sounder run with precision controlled ac\r\npower in 1949]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 31.--_Forty-eight cross sections of Northwest\r\nAtlantic Mid-Ocean Canyon_\r\n\r\nSoundings originally recorded on UQN-1B sounder with precision\r\ncontrolled ac power in 1952]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWESTERN ATLANTIC: The major abyssal plains of the western Atlantic are\r\nconnected from north to south by a series of abyssal gaps and mid-ocean\r\ncanyons. The Northwest Atlantic Mid-Ocean Canyon (Fig. 29) begins in an\r\nunknown area north of the limit of the physiographic diagram (Ewing _et\r\nal._, 1953). It runs south parallel to the continental margin of the\r\nGrand Banks on the west and to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge on the east until\r\nit reaches the Southeast Newfoundland Ridge, where it cuts through a\r\nnarrow abyssal gap. After passing through the gap, the canyon turns\r\nwest, broadens, and is finally lost in the Sohm Abyssal Plain. The\r\nmid-ocean canyon is about 3 miles wide and 50 fathoms deep north of the\r\nSoutheast Newfoundland Ridge (Fig. 30). The west wall is about 10-15\r\nfathoms higher than the east wall (Fig. 32). The canyon has been mapped\r\nby more than 80 echo-sounding profiles (Fig. 31). The average slope of\r\nthe sea floor at right angles to the axis of the canyon in most places\r\nexceeds the gradient of the canyon. The gradient west to east is about\r\n1:1500, while the gradient of the canyon from north to south is 1:2250.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 32.--_Long profile of Northwest Atlantic\r\nMid-Ocean Canyon_\r\n\r\nNumerals I-VIII indicate location of profiles of Figure 30.]\r\n\r\nThe mid-ocean canyon forms gentle meanders (Fig. 29). As the gradient\r\nof the canyon decreases, the canyon changes its cross-section form from\r\na narrow, deep canyon to a broad, shallow one (Figs. 31 and 32).\r\n\r\nThe mid-ocean canyon follows an exceptionally narrow and deep abyssal\r\ngap through the Southeast Newfoundland Ridge. At its narrowest point\r\nthe gap is no wider than the mid-ocean canyon.\r\n\r\nMid-Ocean Canyon No. 2 is nearly identical to the Northwest Atlantic\r\nMid-Ocean Canyon in shape and form (Pl. 14, fig. 2). It has been traced\r\nfor only 350 miles through the northwest arm of the Sohm Abyssal Plain.\r\nThere is a strong suggestion of a low sill running northeast of the\r\nBermuda Rise toward the \"tail\" of the Grand Banks. Such a sill would\r\ncut off the northwest arm of the Sohm Abyssal Plain. Mid-Ocean Canyon\r\nNo. 2 would in this case be associated with this abyssal gap connecting\r\nthe higher northwest arm with the deeper central and southern parts of\r\nthe Sohm Plain. A large magnetic anomaly which crosses the plain at\r\nthis point is possibly evidence of a buried ridge beneath the abyssal\r\nplain. Mid-Ocean Canyon No. 2 has been traced from the vicinity of\r\nKelvin Seamount eastward to the supposed sill. As in the case of the\r\nNorthwest Atlantic Mid-Ocean Canyon the gradient at right angles to\r\nthe canyon axis generally exceeds the gradient of the canyon floor. A\r\nsystematic difference in depth between the two walls was not found in\r\nMid-Ocean Canyon No. 2.\r\n\r\nA small area (8000 square miles) of abyssal hills lies between the\r\nnorthwest arm of the Sohm Abyssal Plain and the northern edge of\r\nthe Hatteras Abyssal Plain. Although many sounding lines have been\r\nrun through this area it is not yet clear whether this area is best\r\nreferred to as an abyssal gap or a sill, although the evidence seems\r\nto favor a gap. The western end of the Sohm Plain seems to reach a\r\nsmooth sill a few dozen miles east of Caryn Peak, and the abyssal plain\r\nsurrounding Caryn Peak, at the mouth of the Hudson Canyon, seems either\r\nto be isolated or to be connected with the Hatteras Abyssal Plain to\r\nthe south through an abyssal gap.\r\n\r\nAn abyssal gap may possibly connect Sohm Plain to the eastern end of\r\nthe Nares Abyssal Plain, but in consideration of the eastward gradients\r\nof the Nares Abyssal Plain it seems probable that no gaps cut all the\r\nway through the wide abyssal-hills province which separates the two\r\nplains. The gap connecting the Hatteras Abyssal Plain and the Nares\r\nAbyssal Plain southwest of the Bermuda Rise has been named Vema Gap\r\nafter the Research Vessel VEMA which has been used most extensively in\r\nthis area. Vema Gap is about 20 miles wide and 70 miles long; its long\r\naxis is oriented approximately west-east. The Hatteras Plain reaches\r\na depth of 2900 fathoms a few miles west of the gap. The gradient of\r\nthe plain is about 1:3000 at that point. The Nares abyssal plain to\r\nthe southeast lies at about 3070 fathoms and slopes eastward with a\r\ngradient of about 1:3500. The floor of the gap, in sharp contrast to\r\nthe adjacent plains, slopes eastward at an average gradient of 1:300.\r\nThe edge of the Hatteras Abyssal Plain is cut by several mid-ocean\r\ncanyons 20 fathoms deep and a mile wide which develop a few miles to\r\nthe west and converge on the abyssal gap. Associated with Vema Gap is\r\na large magnetic anomaly similar to the one observed near the supposed\r\ngap north of the Bermuda Rise, which again could possibly be evidence\r\nof a prominent buried ridge forming the sill of the gap.\r\n\r\nThe Old Bahama Channel Abyssal Plain and the Hispaniola-Caicos Abyssal\r\nPlain are probably connected by a steep-walled abyssal gap which runs\r\nwest to east south of Great Inagua Island.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 33.--_Tracing of PDR record across Theta Gap_]\r\n\r\nEASTERN ATLANTIC: The only abyssal gap known in the eastern Atlantic\r\nwas sounded by M/V THETA and is here named Theta Gap. This gap lies\r\noff the northwest cape of Spain between the Biscay and Iberia abyssal\r\nplains. Its existence is based on only a few profiles, one of which is\r\nillustrated in Figure 33. Small depressions a few fathoms deep and 1-2\r\nmiles wide were observed in the Biscay Abyssal Plain and may represent\r\nmid-ocean canyons, which may possibly connect with Theta Gap (Pl. 8,\r\nfig. 2). Insufficient precision-sounding tracks are available in this\r\narea to determine the exact nature of these features.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Origin of abyssal-floor topography._--The explanation that abyssal\r\nplains represent portions of the abyssal floor buried beneath sediments\r\ntransported by turbidity currents, and that the abyssal hills represent\r\nthis unburied surface, has been offered by Heezen _et al._ (1951; 1954)\r\nand by Menard (1955). Abyssal gaps are pictured as passages through\r\nwhich turbidity currents flow from a higher plain to a lower one.\r\nSediment must have filled in the Hatteras Plain to the present depth of\r\nthe western end of Vema Gap before the Nares Abyssal Plain could begin\r\nto form. Ewing _et al._ (1953) suggest that the Northwest Atlantic\r\nMid-Ocean Canyon was probably formed by turbidity currents which flow\r\nfrom the vicinity of Greenland to the Sohm Abyssal Plain. Whether the\r\ncanyon-forming process was largely erosional or depositional remains to\r\nbe seen, but the narrow, deep abyssal gap in the Southeast Newfoundland\r\nRidge suggests erosion. The parallelism of the Mid-Ocean Canyon with\r\nthe Mid-Atlantic Ridge even suggests a tectonic origin. The deep-sea\r\nsands of the canyon floor and its continuous gradient argue as strongly\r\nfor a turbidity-current origin. The features of the smooth parts of\r\nthe abyssal floor seem clearly the result of deposition by turbidity\r\ncurrents (Ericson _et al._, 1955; in press).\r\n\r\n\r\nOCEANIC RISES\r\n\r\n_Definition and distribution._--An oceanic rise is a large area\r\n(measured in hundreds of miles), not connected to or included in a\r\nmid-oceanic ridge or connected to a continental rise, which rises a few\r\nhundred fathoms above the surrounding abyssal floor. The topography of\r\nan oceanic rise ranges from gentle to extremely rugged.\r\n\r\nIncluded in this classification is the Bermuda Rise and Corner Rise of\r\nthe North Atlantic, the Rio Grande Rise of the South Atlantic, and a\r\nnumber of similar but unnamed features in the Indian and Pacific oceans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Regional description._--Only three oceanic rises are situated in the\r\nNorth Atlantic. They are: Bermuda Rise, Corner Rise, and Rockall Rise.\r\nOf these only the Bermuda Rise has been crossed by many echo-sounding\r\ntraverses.\r\n\r\nBERMUDA RISE: In the center of the North America Basin and surrounding\r\nthe island of Bermuda is an oval asymmetrical arch about 300 by 600\r\nmiles with the long axis oriented northeast. The topography of the\r\nBermuda Rise is relatively gentle as compared to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge\r\nbut considerably more rugged than the continental rise (Pl. 27). The\r\nrise is usually distinctly marked on the west by a 10- to 100-fathom\r\ndecrease in depth and a change from the monotonously smooth abyssal\r\nplain on the west to gently rolling hills, 20-50 fathoms high and 2-10\r\nmiles wide (Pl. 16). In contrast the eastern edge of the rise is marked\r\nby a series of scarps 300-900 fathoms high (Pl. 17), and the adjacent\r\nrise topography is relatively rugged. West of the scarp zone the\r\ntopography is quite smooth to the western margin of the rise (Pl. 16).\r\n\r\nAn apron 30 miles wide surrounds the 2300-fathom high pedestal which\r\nsupports the island of Bermuda (Pl. 20). From this apron Ericson,\r\nEwing, and Heezen (1952), reported quantities of shallow-water-derived\r\ncarbonate clastics.\r\n\r\nNorth of Bermuda the rise is marked by a number of high seamounts which\r\ncontinue across the adjacent abyssal plain and form the Kelvin Group of\r\nseamounts. Many of these appear to be flat-topped.\r\n\r\nThe Bermuda Rise is bounded on the east and north by the Sohm Abyssal\r\nPlain, on the west by the Hatteras Plain, and on the south by the Nares\r\nPlain. For a short distance on the northwest and a few hundred miles on\r\nthe southeast the rise is bordered by abyssal hills. The western edge\r\nof the Bermuda Rise is formed in places by a scarp, but particularly\r\nin the northwest the Bermuda Plateau seems to dip gently beneath the\r\nHatteras Abyssal Plain.\r\n\r\nThe details of the topography of the Bermuda Rise are demonstrated by\r\nthe series of radiating profiles in Plate 27.\r\n\r\nBermuda Pedestal.--The islands of Bermuda lie along the southeast rim\r\nof a flat-topped pedestal whose surface lies less than 20 fathoms below\r\nsea level. The sides of the Bermuda Pedestal slope at gradients of 1:5\r\nto 1:30 and fall rapidly to the 2300-fathom contour where the base of\r\nthe pedestal is reached. The pedestal is 50 miles by 80 miles at its\r\nbase. Cores containing Tertiary sediments and recent reef detritus, and\r\nin one case basaltic rock, have been obtained from the sides of the\r\nBermuda Pedestal (Pl. 28).\r\n\r\nBermuda Apron.--Encircling the base of the Bermuda Pedestal is a\r\nsmooth, gently sloping apron or depositional terrace. The width of the\r\napron is irregular and ranges from 40 miles on the east to 20 miles\r\non the west. Gradients decrease to 1:700 away from the pedestal, but\r\nthe outer edge of the apron in places has gradients of 1:90. On some\r\nprofiles hills up to 125 fathoms in height occur near the outer edge of\r\nthe apron and become increasingly numerous until at a distance of 45\r\nmiles from the pedestal the apron is not recognizable as a topographic\r\nfeature. The limits of the apron will ultimately be defined by a study\r\nof the sediments.\r\n\r\nBermuda Plateau.--The Bermuda Plateau is an oval area of 90,000\r\nsquare miles, which lies roughly in the center of the Bermuda Rise.\r\nThe topography is characterized by low hills and rather extensive\r\nintermontane valleys (Pl. 16). Few individual hills exceed 50 fathoms\r\nin height. The topography of the sub-province is well illustrated in\r\nPlate 16. The depth is 2400 to 2700 fathoms. The plateau is bounded on\r\nthe southeast by the Bermuda Scarp Zone. On the west it extends almost\r\nto the edge of the rise. On the north the Crescent Peaks and Muir\r\nSeamount Group have made it difficult to define the edge of the plateau.\r\n\r\nCrescent Peaks.--Northwest of Bermuda a crescent-shaped line of conical\r\npeaks borders the Bermuda Apron. Individual peaks are 600 fathoms\r\nhigh and 4 to 6 miles wide at their base. This range of peaks forms a\r\ndistinct sub-province which rises from the Bermuda Plateau.\r\n\r\nBermuda Scarp Zone.--The Bermuda Plateau is broken along its eastern\r\nmargin by a series of scarps (Pl. 17). There appear to be two systems\r\nof scarps, one trending about N. 55° W. and the other about N. 35°\r\nE. Individual scarps range from 100 to 700 fathoms in height. The\r\nintersecting set of lines shown on the province chart (Pl. 20)\r\nindicates prominent scarps in this area. Dashed lines represent more\r\nspeculative scarps. A further study of this interesting area is\r\nunderway, and it is hoped that a more-detailed mapping of these scarps\r\nwill be possible. Needless to say, dredging on these scarps should\r\nbring rich rewards in fossil sediments and igneous rocks which are\r\nundoubtedly exposed on these precipitous cliffs. The general character\r\nof the scarp zone is illustrated in Plate 17 by an echogram. There seem\r\nto be three or four major ne-sw scarps. In the east-central Bermuda\r\nRise the areas between the scarp zones remain at virtually the same\r\ndepth as the unfractured Bermuda Rise farther west. However, toward the\r\nsoutheast the inter-scarp areas drop as a series of steps. The depth\r\nalong the base of each scarp is nevertheless deeper than the next lower\r\nstep. The smaller topographic features of the southeast part of the\r\nscarp zone are very similar to the abyssal hills to the southeast and\r\nare thus probably of the same origin. The strips between successive\r\nscarps tend to shallow to the southeast and reach minimum depths just\r\nbefore the next scarp is reached.\r\n\r\nMuir Seamount Group.--In 1945 workers on the U.S.S. MUIR discovered a\r\nlarge seamount 140 miles northeast of the Bermuda Islands. Subsequent\r\nreconnaissance surveys by the Lamont Geological Observatory (Tolstoy,\r\n1951; Tolstoy and Ewing, 1949) revealed that the peak was asymmetrical\r\nin east-west profile (considerably steeper on the east) and that the\r\nseamount was elongate northeast-southwest parallel to the axis of\r\nthe Bermuda Rise. Cores taken near its summit contained Eocene to\r\nPleistocene sediment. Additional seamounts have been discovered in the\r\narea by Worzel and Shurbet (1955) and Northrop and Frosch (1954). The\r\nasymmetrical profile and the elongate shape parallel to the axis of the\r\nBermuda Rise suggest that Muir Seamount is a tectonic uplift rather\r\nthan a volcanic pile, but admittedly undersea vulcanism need not always\r\nproduce symmetrical cones. As known, Muir Seamount is 35 miles wide\r\n(northwest-southeast), 60 miles long (northeast-southwest), and rises\r\n1700 fathoms above the Bermuda Rise. The minimum sounding recorded is\r\n846 fathoms. The Muir Seamount and near-by associated peaks apparently\r\nare not directly related to the Kelvin Seamount Group farther north.\r\nThe north and northwest margin of the Bermuda Rise, like that on\r\nthe west, is in some places a scarp and in other places a gentle\r\ntransition. Near the northwest corner of the Bermuda Rise a range of\r\nhills each about 20 fathoms high and 3 miles wide follows the margin of\r\nthe rise for many miles. The northeastern margin of the Bermuda Rise is\r\nabrupt in most places, and in some places a single scarp 500 fathoms\r\nhigh is all that separates the Bermuda Rise from the adjacent abyssal\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nSediments of the Bermuda Rise.--Most of the Bermuda Rise lies below the\r\ndepth of 2500 fathoms, and thus the sediment ranges from foraminiferal\r\nclay through red clay with a predominance of red clay. In the vicinity\r\nof the Bermuda Pedestal calcareous detrital sediments have built a\r\ndepositional apron around the base of the pedestal in depths of 2300 to\r\n2450 fathoms (Pl. 28). The seamounts of the Bermuda Rise are rocky, as\r\nshown by photographs and bottom samples. Several cores from the Muir\r\nSeamount revealed a variety of Tertiary foraminiferal lutites. With the\r\nexception of the detrital sediments of the Bermuda Apron, the scoured\r\ncrests and flanks of the larger seamounts, and the steeper scarps, the\r\nBermuda Rise is covered preponderantly by pelagic sediments. This is in\r\nsharp contrast to the surrounding abyssal plain and near-by continental\r\nrise, where cores reveal frequent alterations of detrital and pelagic\r\nsediments (Pl. 28).\r\n\r\nCORNER RISE: Much less extensive and less well known is Corner Rise\r\nwhich lies directly south of the Grand Banks on the east side of the\r\nSohm Abyssal Plain. Corner Rise is so named because its northwest\r\nboundary with the abyssal floor forms a sharp, nearly right-angled\r\ncorner (Pl. 20). The main part of Corner Rise is formed by a group of\r\nlarge, poorly surveyed seamounts. Several of the peaks rise to 1500\r\nfathoms. The area is represented in profile I of Plate 22 (between\r\nmile marks 1000 and 1200). Photographs taken on Corner Seamount at the\r\nnorthwestern extremity of Corner Rise showed rippled and hard-clay\r\nbottom to 1200 fathoms. The fact that these seamounts apparently form\r\na prolongation of the Kelvin Seamount Group suggests the need for\r\ndetailed investigation of the latter seamounts and the probability that\r\nadditional volcanic seamounts may be found along the same trend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 34.--_Natural scale profile, Kelvin Seamount\r\nGroup_]\r\n\r\nROCKALL RISE: Southwest of Rockall Bank between 19°W. and 23°W. on\r\nthe 50th parallel, rising from the abyssal floor of the northeastern\r\nAtlantic, is an ill-defined area of irregular topography which seems\r\nnot to belong to the Lower Step of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Little is\r\nknown of this area, and its classification as a rise may not survive\r\nmore detailed study. The area is illustrated in Plate 25 by profile E-1.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEAMOUNTS OF THE OCEAN-BASIN FLOOR\r\n\r\nA seamount is defined as any isolated elevation which rises more than\r\n500 fathoms above the sea floor. Those seamounts which lie entirely on\r\noceanic rises have been described as part of the rise topography. Now\r\nwe will describe the seamounts of the abyssal floor.\r\n\r\nKELVIN SEAMOUNT GROUP: An impressive row of large conical peaks runs\r\nfrom the vicinity of Georges Bank for 600 miles toward the northeast\r\ntip of the Bermuda Rise. A profile plotted at natural scale which\r\ncrosses five of the largest seamounts is reproduced in Figure 34. The\r\nline of seamounts runs across the continental rise, abyssal plain, and\r\nthe Bermuda Rise, seemingly little affected on crossing the province\r\nboundaries. The larger seamounts such as Kelvin Seamount are about 2000\r\nfathoms higher than the adjacent plain and are as much as 35 miles in\r\ndiameter at the base. Those which rise from the continental rise or the\r\nabyssal plain do so abruptly, suggesting that their bases are partially\r\nburied. The tops of most of these seamounts lie between 550 and 850\r\nfathoms, and at least a few are flat-topped. They are thus very similar\r\nto the flat-topped guyots of the Pacific in size, shape, and the range\r\nof depths of their flat summits (Hamilton, 1956). Photographs taken on\r\nthese seamounts showed rock, ripples and live solitary corals.\r\n\r\nCARYN SEAMOUNT: A small conical peak, 1000 fathoms high, whose base is\r\n8 miles in diameter, lies in the abyssal plain west of the Bermuda Rise\r\n(36° 45´N.). A magnetic survey of the peak has been published by Miller\r\nand Ewing (1956). They found an exceptionally large anomaly associated\r\nwith the peak, which clearly showed its volcanic origin. Cores from the\r\npeak contained manganese nodules, altered volcanic rocks, and Upper\r\nCretaceous to Recent fossils, which shows that it is at least as old\r\nas Upper Cretaceous. The base of the peak rises from the abyssal plain\r\nwhich extends out from the Hudson Submarine Delta.\r\n\r\nHORSESHOE SEAMOUNT GROUP: About 300 miles due west from the Straits of\r\nGibraltar an impressive group of seamounts lies in a horseshoe-shaped\r\narc. Several of these, most notably Ampere and Josephine seamounts,\r\nrise to less than 100 fathoms. Josephine Seamount is the largest\r\nof the group and lies along an east-west topographic trend (the\r\nAzores-Gibraltar Ridge). In the southern half of the Horseshoe Group\r\nthe individual seamounts appear to be coalescing cones similar to the\r\nseamounts of the Kelvin Group. Seamounts of the northern half, although\r\nimperfectly known, seem to be elongated east-west. The southern half\r\nof the group appears to resemble volcanic cones, while in the northern\r\nhalf tectonic deformation seems to have played a larger part. The\r\nseamounts have been cored, dredged, and photographed by a Lamont\r\nObservatory expedition. The sediments obtained from the seamounts are\r\nmiddle Tertiary to Recent (Sutton _et al._, 1957).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                                 Heezen _et al._, PL. 16\r\n\r\nFIGURE 1.

Again lack of evidence of\r\nstrong currents or outcrops is notable.\r\n\r\nPositions of stations shown on Plate 30]\r\n\r\nPhotographs of the seamounts generally show winnowed and rippled\r\nsediment and rock (Pl. 15). Virtually all loose sediment is being\r\nremoved from the seamounts. The horseshoe, open to the east, encloses\r\nan abyssal plain which is, judging from the sea-floor gradients, fed\r\nlargely from the east by turbidity currents originating in the Straits\r\nof Gibraltar and the Gulf of Cadiz areas.\r\n\r\nMILNE SEAMOUNT: Early charts of the western Atlantic showed an\r\nextensive bank of 20,000 square miles rising from the center of\r\nNewfoundland Abyssal Plain. At about the center of this area an\r\nexceptionally high peak has been discovered by cable ships, and the old\r\nname Milne Seamount has been assigned to this peak. It rises more than\r\n2500 fathoms above the abyssal floor. Two seamounts of similar size\r\nhave been found north and south of the Milne Seamount by workers on the\r\nR. V. ATLANTIS (Fig. 30).\r\n\r\nAs the abyssal floor is better surveyed many more isolated seamounts\r\nwill undoubtedly be discovered, and they may reveal tectonically\r\nsignificant patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEISMICITY OF THE OCEAN-BASIN FLOOR\r\n\r\nThe ocean-basin floor provinces are virtually devoid of earthquakes of\r\na size detectable at distant seismic observatories. Of course small\r\nearthquakes (< 5, Richter scale) would probably not be locatable in\r\nsuch remote regions. The virtual absence of larger shocks makes it\r\nimprobable that many small ones occur there either. Two earthquakes\r\nhave occurred in the Bermuda Rise, one near the west boundary and one\r\nin the scarp zone of the southeast Bermuda Rise (Pl. 29). Several\r\nquakes were felt in Bermuda before instrumental recording was available\r\nto permit location of their epicenters. Two quakes occurred in the\r\nabyssal plain northwest of the Cape Verde Islands, and two were located\r\nnear Theta Gap northwest of Cape Finistere. All other earthquakes\r\nof the central part of the ocean basin are associated with the\r\nMid-Atlantic Ridge or its eastern extension.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCEAN-BASIN FLOOR PROVINCES AND CRUSTAL STRUCTURE\r\n\r\nThe results of seismic-refraction measurements in the ocean-basin\r\nfloor can be divided into two categories depending on whether the\r\nmeasurements were made (1) in the abyssal floor, or (2) on an oceanic\r\nrise. Measurements in the abyssal floor of the western Atlantic (Ewing,\r\nSutton, and Officer, 1954) revealed the simple pattern shown in Figure\r\n35_b_ and _e_--namely, that beneath 4-5 km of water lies .5-1 km of\r\nsediments and sedimentary rock with a compressional-wave velocity of\r\nabout 2 km/sec, overlying 3-4 km of oceanic crustal rocks (6.5 km/sec);\r\nbeneath this the sub-M mantle rocks show a velocity of about 8.1\r\nkm/sec. This pattern has been observed by most workers in the abyssal\r\nfloors of other oceans (Raitt, 1957; Hill, 1956).\r\n\r\nOfficer, Ewing, and Wuenschel (1952) and Katz and Ewing (1955) have\r\nreported on the structure of the Bermuda Rise. The topographic\r\nchange from abyssal floor to the Bermuda Rise is accompanied by a\r\ncorresponding change in crustal structure (Fig. 35_b_ and _d_).\r\n\r\nA typical column measured on the Bermuda Plateau is shown in Figure\r\n35_d_. Here the sub-M velocity appears to be lower, or possibly a new\r\nintermediate-velocity layer is inserted between the oceanic crust\r\nand the true mantle. In the Bermuda Rise seismic velocities in the\r\noceanic crust differ somewhat from the typical abyssal-floor values.\r\nIn the Bermuda Apron and adjacent parts of the Bermuda Plateau (Fig.\r\n35_c_) above the oceanic crust a thick (up to 4 km) section of 4.5\r\nkm/sec velocity is found which has been quite reasonably identified as\r\nsedimentary and volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\nSeismic-reflection measurements in the smoother parts of the\r\nocean-basin floor fall into two general groups. Reflection records from\r\nthe oceanic rises generally show a succession of reflections which\r\ncan be correlated for considerable distances. Reflection records from\r\nthe abyssal plains in general show many reflections which are usually\r\nimpossible to correlate even between adjacent shots. This difference\r\nhas been explained by Ericson, Ewing, and Heezen (1952) in terms of\r\nthe distribution of turbidity-current deposits. In the abyssal plains\r\nrelatively frequent turbidity flows have deposited an alternating\r\nsequence of clays and silts which return a great number of reflections\r\nto the reflection seismograph. In contrast the rises receive only\r\npelagic sedimentation, and thus the layering of their sedimentary cover\r\nis simple and widespread since it relates to major changes in pelagic\r\nsedimentation of past geologic ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 35.--_Crustal sections in various physiographic\r\nprovinces, determined by seismic-refraction measurements_\r\n\r\n(a).

Ewing]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMID-OCEANIC RIDGE\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION\r\n\r\nThe third basic subdivision of the oceanic depression is the\r\nMid-Oceanic Ridge, a continuous median ridge which runs the length\r\nof the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific\r\noceans, for more than 40,000 miles (Heezen and Ewing, in press). In\r\nthe center third of the physiographic diagram a short segment of this\r\nworld-encircling ridge is represented.\r\n\r\n\r\nMID-ATLANTIC RIDGE\r\n\r\nOne can find references to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the scientific\r\nliterature dating back more than 80 years. Before the advent of the\r\necho sounder the lateral limits of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge were very\r\ndifficult to define, and even now widely different definitions are\r\nused. Murray (1912) mentioned that the ridge lay in depths less than\r\n2000 fathoms but pointed out that locally on the ridge depths exceeded\r\n2000 fathoms. The METEOR expedition charts and profiles generally imply\r\nby their labeling that the ridge is the area enclosed by the 4000-meter\r\ncontour (2250 fathoms). Shepard (1948) states that its \"average depth\r\nis about 1500 fathoms, but it rises about 1000 fathoms above deeper\r\nzones on either side.\"\r\n\r\nTolstoy and Ewing (1949) and Tolstoy (1951) in general limit the ridge\r\nto depths of less than 2500 fathoms, although in one part of the text\r\nTolstoy and Ewing limit it to less than 2240 fathoms, and Tolstoy\r\n(1951) implies that the ridge extends to 2900 fathoms. In the present\r\npaper the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is considered as a morpho-tectonic unit\r\ndefined in terms of morphology, and therefore its definition is not\r\nbased on a closed isobath.\r\n\r\nThe Mid-Atlantic Ridge is that portion of the Mid-Oceanic Ridge system\r\nwhich lies within the limits of the Atlantic Ocean. It consists of a\r\nbroad, fractured median arch or swell which occupies approximately\r\nthe center third of the ocean. Its crest lies near the median line of\r\nthe ocean, and its lateral boundaries are formed by scarps[2] which\r\nlie near the axes of maximum depth of the eastern and western basins.\r\nAdjacent to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge both to the east and to the west is\r\nthe abyssal floor (usually abyssal hills) of the ocean-basin floor.\r\n\r\n[2] Scarps have been seen on every recorded crossing. If they should\r\nbe absent on a future crossing, it is expected that a major change in\r\ngradient will be found which will serve as a consistent definition for\r\nthe ridge boundary.\r\n\r\nExaggerated profiles are useful in bringing out the major morphological\r\ncharacteristics of deep-sea topography. For some purposes, however,\r\nit is desirable to study the topography in profiles with no vertical\r\nexaggeration. Two such profiles are shown in Figures 37-41. The\r\nposition of the two profiles is indicated in Figure 36. A very good\r\nidea of the individual slopes can be gained from a study of these\r\nnatural-scale profiles, but the province boundaries are very difficult\r\nto identify.\r\n\r\nA typical cross profile at 40:1 exaggeration is shown in Figure 42, a\r\ntypical oceanic cross section, in which each physiographic province of\r\nthe Mid-Atlantic Ridge is labelled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 36.--_Index to natural-scale Mid-Atlantic Ridge\r\nprofiles reproduced in Figures 37-41_]\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVINCES OF THE MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE\r\n\r\nThe Mid-Atlantic Ridge was subdivided by Tolstoy and Ewing (1949) and\r\nTolstoy (1951) into (a) \"the central backbone or main range which is\r\nshallower than 1600 fathoms,\" and (b) \"the flanks\" or \"the terraced\r\nzone\" \"between the 1600- and 2500-fathom isobaths.\" In this paper we\r\nuse a similar but somewhat differently defined system by dividing the\r\nprovinces of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge into two categories: (1) the crest\r\nprovinces, and (2) the flank provinces.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Crest provinces._--The provinces of the crest of the Mid-Atlantic\r\nRidge consist of (1) the Rift Valley (or Valleys); (2) Rift Mountains;\r\nand (3) High Fractured Plateau (Fig. 43). The Azores Plateau, which\r\nforms part of the crest, presents additional problems and is discussed\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nRIFT VALLEY: The most striking feature on an average profile across\r\nthe Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a deep notch or cleft in the crest of the\r\nridge. In a small percentage of the sounding profiles two or three such\r\nvalleys are present, and on a few profiles no notable depressions are\r\nobserved. On an average profile the floor of the valley lies at about\r\n2000 fathoms, while the adjacent peaks average about 1000 fathoms below\r\nthe sea surface. The width of the valley between the crests of the\r\nadjacent peaks ranges between 15 and 30 miles, and the depth of the\r\nvalley floor beneath the highest adjacent peak ranges from 700 to 2100\r\nfathoms. The width of the valley 500 fathoms above its floor ranges\r\nfrom 5 to 22 miles. The range in observed depths of the valley is 1150\r\nto 2850 fathoms in the area of the physiographic diagram. The adjacent\r\npeaks range from 500 to 1300 fathoms within the same area (excluding\r\nthe area near the Azores) (Fig. 47).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 37.--_Natural-scale Mid-Atlantic Ridge profile\r\n1A_\r\n\r\nSlope corrections have been applied to profiles 1 and 2. The method is\r\ndescribed by Elmendorf and Heezen (1957).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 38.--_Natural-scale Mid-Atlantic Ridge profile\r\n1B_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 39.--_Natural-scale Mid-Atlantic Ridge profile\r\n1C_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 40.--_Natural-scale Mid-Atlantic Ridge profile\r\n2A_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 41.--_Natural-scale Mid-Atlantic Ridge profile\r\n2B_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 42.--_Type profile, provinces of the Mid-Atlantic\r\nRidge_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 43.--_Tracing of PDR record, Rift Valley, Rift\r\nMountains, High Fractured Plateau, and Upper Step_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 44.--_Tracing of PDR record, Western Rift\r\nMountains_]\r\n\r\nTwenty-six crossings of the Rift Valley are shown in Figure 45. The\r\nprofiles can be divided into three groups: (1) single well-developed\r\nrift valley; (2) several well-developed deep valleys; (3) no\r\nparticularly deep central valley. Most of the profiles (20) fall into\r\nthe first class; the second class is represented by 5, and only 1 falls\r\nin the third class.\r\n\r\nThe topography of the floor of the rift is rough. In no instance has a\r\nflat floor been observed. Where the valley is widest mountains a few\r\nhundred fathoms high protrude from its floor.\r\n\r\nRIFT MOUNTAINS: The steep walls flanking the rift each form one side of\r\na large rough-sided block. They might be considered as tilted blocks\r\nwhose facing slopes form the Rift Valley. The back or outer slope of\r\nthe Rift-Mountains Province is generally broken into mountains as much\r\nas 500 fathoms high and 10 miles wide (Fig. 44). The lateral limit of\r\nthe Rift-Mountains Province is reached when the average slope of the\r\nsea floor flattens markedly. Because of the high local relief it is\r\nsometimes difficult to pick the boundary of the Rift Mountains, but in\r\nalmost all recorded profiles the approximate position of the boundary\r\nis unmistakable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 45.--_Twenty-six rift valley profiles,\r\nMid-Atlantic Ridge_\r\n\r\nPosition of profiles shown on Plate 23]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 46.--_Five representative profiles, crest and\r\nwestern flank of Mid-Atlantic Ridge_]\r\n\r\nHIGH FRACTURED PLATEAU: The High Fractured Plateau is adjacent to\r\nthe Rift Mountains on either side of the ridge (Fig. 42). The local\r\nrelief is about 400 fathoms from peak to adjacent valley, and the\r\ndistance from peak to peak ranges from 8 to 20 miles. In contrast to\r\nthe adjacent flank provinces there are no filled intermontane valleys,\r\nand the valleys are deeper and narrower than in the adjacent Upper Step\r\nProvince. Within the limits of the physiographic diagram, the average\r\ndepth of the High Fractured Plateau ranges from 1500 to 1900 fathoms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Flank provinces._--Between the outer margin of the High Fractured\r\nPlateau provinces and the level of the ocean-basin floor lies a\r\nsuccession of parallel provinces, known as the Upper Step, the Middle\r\nStep, and the Lower Step. The limits of these provinces are the least\r\nwell defined of all the provinces described in this paper. The flanks\r\nof the ridge are characterized by rough topography (Pl. 18). Peaks\r\nof more than 200 fathoms high occur at a frequency of about 15 per\r\n100 miles. Some of the valleys between peaks are smooth, particularly\r\nin the provinces south of the Azores Plateau. The flanks of the\r\nMid-Atlantic Ridge are broken by scarps which seem to persist for\r\nrelatively long distances parallel to the trend of the crest (Pl. 20).\r\nThese scarps or scarp zones break the ridge into a succession of units\r\nhere called steps (Fig. 46). An alternative solution also seriously\r\nconsidered by the writers is that the steps might more correctly be\r\nconsidered as a series of tilted blocks which could be referred to as\r\nramps. The difference between the two solutions can be appreciated by\r\ninspecting Figures 42 and 46.\r\n\r\nThe writers must emphasize that the term \"terraces\" of Tolstoy is in no\r\nsense the same as the term \"step\" used in this paper. Tolstoy defined\r\nhis terraces as \"a succession of smooth shelves, each from 1 to 50\r\nmiles in width,\" which occupy a zone \"200-300 miles\" wide. Features\r\nfitting this definition are called \"intermontane basins\" in this paper,\r\nfollowing a suggestion made by Heezen et al. (1951).\r\n\r\nThe location of smooth-floored intermontane basins is shown on Plate\r\n20. They are found only in the area extending about 8° southwest of\r\nthe Azores. Small arrows indicate the slope of the smooth floors. In\r\ngeneral all the valleys slope away from the crest of the ridge. Steps,\r\non the contrary, are a succession of average levels separated by scarps\r\nor scarp zones and in general are not smooth except that a few basins\r\nmay be filled. However, this filling is limited to a small area south\r\nof the Azores.\r\n\r\nThe flanks are divided into three steps: upper, middle, and lower. The\r\ndivision of anything into three parts is suspicious, whether it be a\r\ngeologic period or a physiographic region. Such divisions usually are\r\nlater replaced as more information is obtained. This is probably true\r\nof the three steps. We are more confident of the significance of the\r\nboundaries shown on the province chart than of the uniqueness of the\r\nenclosed areas, because each boundary marks a major scarp or scarp\r\nzone. The steps are defined in part in any limited area on the basis of\r\ntheir mean depth. In general the Upper Step ranges from 1650 to 2300,\r\nthe Middle Step from 2250 to 2500, and the Lower Step from 2350 to\r\n2800 fathoms. Just as the maximum depth of the ridge and the axis of\r\nmaximum depth of the basin vary with distance along the ridge (or with\r\nlatitude), so the steps vary in depth and width (Fig. 47).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 47.--_Axial profile of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge_\r\n\r\n(a).

The Azores Islands are oriented\r\nsouth-southeast-north-northwest along a topographic trend which strikes\r\noff toward the Straits of Gibraltar. This topographic connection\r\nbetween the Azores Plateau and the southern Iberian Peninsula has been\r\ncalled the Azores-Gibraltar Ridge, which the present writers consider\r\nas a poorly developed mid-oceanic ridge of the same general class as\r\nthe Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The Azores Plateau itself merges with the Rift\r\nMountains of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The sea-floor topographic trends\r\nof the eastern part of the plateau are parallel to the known tectonic\r\nand volcanic trends of the Azores Islands (Agostinho, 1937). In the\r\nwestern part of the Azores Plateau trends are north-south parallel to\r\nthe main trends of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Although both Wüst (1940a)\r\nand Tolstoy (1951) have published contour charts of the Azores Plateau,\r\nit remains largely a mystery whether the trends of the eastern Azores\r\nPlateau cross or join the axial trends of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The\r\nAzores Plateau or bulge is generally considered as a highly fractured\r\ntectonic uplift in which vulcanism has played a comparatively small\r\npart (Cloos, 1939).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Azores-Gibraltar Ridge._--An ill-defined irregular ridge runs from\r\nthe eastern end of the Azores Plateau to the Straits of Gibraltar.\r\nLargely on the basis of its seismicity we infer that this ridge is\r\nstructurally and topographically similar to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The\r\nfew existing topographic profiles across this feature suggest that the\r\nearthquake belt is associated with a rift valley of the same general\r\ntype as the central Rift Valley of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Depths in\r\nthis rift appear to reach 2300-2800 fathoms, and the depth of the tops\r\nof the adjoining mountains range from 1600 to 2000 fathoms. The flank\r\nprovinces are even less well developed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Atlantis-Plato-Cruiser-Great Meteor Seamount Chain._--South of the\r\nAzores a chain of great seamounts branches off from the High Fractured\r\nPlateau and crosses the Upper and Middle steps in a nearly north-south\r\ndirection. These seamounts--Atlantis, Plato, Cruiser, and Great\r\nMeteor--in general have broad, nearly flat summits at depths of 100-250\r\nfathoms. The largest one, Great Meteor, was discovered by workers on\r\nthe METEOR in 1937. This seamount, 60 miles across at its base, rises\r\nmajestically more than 2600 fathoms above the floor of the ocean.\r\nSands and calcareous rocks have been dredged from the summits, and\r\nTertiary sediments have been obtained from the flanks of the seamounts.\r\nPhotographs of the tops and of the flanks to a depth of 1600 fathoms\r\nshow ripple marks. This group is described in a paper by Heezen, Ewing,\r\nEricson, and Bentley (in press).\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS OF MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE PHYSIOGRAPHIC PROVINCES\r\n\r\n_Seismicity of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge._--The earthquake epicenters\r\ninstrumentally determined for the North Atlantic up to 1956 are shown\r\nin Plate 29. Nearly all earthquakes fall in the crest zone. Considering\r\nthat determination of shocks is accurate only to within -½° to 1° +,\r\nit is quite surprising that the plotted epicenters form such a narrow\r\nbelt. Investigation of the problem of the physiographic province most\r\nseismically active reveals that many epicenters actually plot in the\r\nRift Valley and that virtually all that do not are within about 1° of\r\nthe Rift Valley. All seismic activity therefore is limited to the crest\r\nprovinces, and probably virtually all the activity is concentrated\r\nwithin the Rift-Valley Province. A line of epicenters runs from the\r\nRift Valley near Flores Island of the Azores toward the Straits of\r\nGibraltar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Sediments and physiographic provinces of the Mid-Atlantic\r\nRidge._--The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is the major site of undisturbed\r\npelagic sedimentation of the Atlantic because of its isolation from\r\ndown-slope movements starting on the continental margin. However,\r\nturbidity currents must form near the shores of oceanic islands and\r\nthe edges of shallow banks and probably contribute sediments to the\r\nintermontane valleys. Photographs taken on the Rift Mountains and\r\non the sides of major seamounts show scour marks and ripple marks,\r\nindicating considerable winnowing and scour by deep-ocean currents (Pl.\r\n19). This sediment carried from the tops of peaks and deposited on the\r\nsteep mountain sides probably slumps occasionally and forms turbidity\r\ncurrents which flow to the adjacent valley floors (Pl. 28). For this\r\nreason cores taken in intermontane valleys and near the higher peaks\r\nwill have considerable interlayering of turbidity-current deposits, and\r\nmuch of the sides and crests of individual high mountains is bare rock.\r\nIn the Rift Mountains true pelagic sediments are only occasionally\r\nfound. It is striking to note that in coring and bottom photography\r\nbare-rock slopes are found most commonly in the Rift Mountains and High\r\nFractured Plateau, but flat-floored intermontane basins are absent in\r\nthese provinces. This must indicate either that the topography of the\r\nRift Mountains is very new or that the sediment eroded from the crest\r\nprovinces is carried all the way to the Upper Step Province where it is\r\ndeposited in the intermontane basins.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Rocks of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge._--Our knowledge of the lithology of\r\nthe Mid-Atlantic Ridge comes from three sources: (1) rocks dredged from\r\nthe sea floor, (2) detrital rock fragments found in sediment cores, and\r\n(3) rocks exposed on the islands of the Ridge.\r\n\r\nSome of the earliest rock dredging on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge was done\r\nin 1885 by the TALISMAN expedition. In 1949 Furon (1949) reported\r\nthe occurrence of fossil trilobites in dredge samples which had been\r\nstored for more than half a century in a French Museum. One dredging\r\nwas made in the High Fractured Plateau of the eastern Atlantic at 42°\r\n21´N., 17° 12´W., in 4255 meters depth (2330 fathoms). Furon believes\r\nthat the material was _in situ_ and therefore proof of early Paleozoic\r\noutcrops on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The abundant evidence of glacially\r\nrafted rocks even as far south as 30° N. casts serious doubt on this\r\nconclusion, but nevertheless the possibility that the material might\r\nhave been _in situ_ must be considered.\r\n\r\nThe Mid-Atlantic Ridge Expedition of 1947 led by Ewing made a number\r\nof successful rock-dredge hauls on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The most\r\nsuccessful hauls were made in the Rift Valley and on the adjacent Rift\r\nMountains at about 30° N. Lat. The specimens have been described by\r\nShand (1949), who reported olivine gabbro, serpentine, basalt, and\r\ndiabase. One limestone of probably Tertiary age was collected the\r\nsame year but has not been described. The suite of crystalline rocks\r\nobtained is similar to those found on oceanic islands elsewhere on the\r\nMid-Oceanic Ridge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Crustal structure and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge provinces._--The crustal\r\nstructure of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge provinces has been determined\r\nat about 20 places by the seismic-refraction technique (Fig. 35f).\r\nThese studies, conducted by John I. Ewing and W. M. Ewing (in press),\r\nhave shown that the average crustal structure of the crest provinces\r\nand Upper Step consists of 0.4 km of low-velocity sediment and 2.8\r\nkm of rock with a velocity of 5.1 km/sec overlying a substratum in\r\nwhich the velocity is 7.3 km/sec. The thickness of the layer of\r\nlow-velocity sediment varies considerably from place to place. In\r\nthe crest provinces the 5.1 km/sec layer is commonly exposed. In the\r\nflank provinces appreciable thicknesses (to 1 km) of sediment have\r\nbeen measured. The sediment seems to thicken between major scarp\r\nzones and ridges as if the sediment were collecting in longitudinal\r\nbasins parallel to the axis of the ridge. An insufficient number of\r\nmeasurements have been made to determine whether these accumulations\r\ncorrelate with the boundaries of individual intermontane basins or with\r\nthe limits of individual step provinces.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the abyssal floor, crest provinces, and flank\r\nprovinces is compared in Figure 35. The two higher-velocity layers\r\nshown in the abyssal-floor sections (Nares and Sohm Abyssal Plain, Fig.\r\n35), have been observed in all measurements made in these provinces.\r\nThe 6.7 km/sec layer is generally considered to be gabbroic, and\r\nthe 8.1 km/sec layer is by definition the earth's mantle. In the\r\nMid-Atlantic Ridge section the upper high-velocity material has\r\nan average velocity of 5.1 km/sec and is generally identified as\r\nbasaltic rock. The velocity of the underlying material (7.3 km/sec) is\r\nintermediate between the velocity of oceanic crustal rocks (6.7 km/sec)\r\nand that of mantle rocks (8.1 km/sec), as observed both beneath the\r\ncontinents and beneath the abyssal floor.\r\n\r\nEwing and Ewing (in press) suggest that this intermediate velocity is\r\nthe result of a physical mixture of oceanic crustal rocks and mantle\r\nrocks. To explain such large-scale mixing they propose that extensive\r\nvulcanism and intrusion along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge have produced\r\nan intermingling of the crustal and mantle rocks, and that this was\r\nassociated with convection cells in the deep mantle which supply large\r\nquantities of basaltic magma and produce extensional forces on the\r\ncrust and upper mantle.\r\n\r\nNearly 20 crossings of the crest of the ridge have been made with the\r\ntotal-intensity magnetometer towed behind research vessels employing\r\ncontinuously recording echo sounders. A characteristic anomaly pattern\r\nhas been noted by Ewing, Heezen, and Hirshman (1957). The Rift Valley\r\nis characterized by a large positive anomaly, while the adjoining Rift\r\nMountains show negative anomalies of 300 to 500 gammas (Fig. 48).\r\n\r\nFree-air gravity anomalies over the crest provinces and Upper Step are\r\nusually 30-50 mg positive, while the Rift Valley as measured in two\r\nplaces gave free-air anomalies of -3 and -20 mg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 48.--_Profile of total magnetic intensity and\r\ntopography, Mid-Atlantic Ridge_\r\n\r\nSoundings made with PDR.

Bullard in the Rift Valley province in\r\nthe North Atlantic indicated a value of about 7 × 10⁻⁶ cal./cm²/sec.\r\nwhich is about 6 times the average value of 1.2 × 10⁻⁶ cal./cm²/sec\r\nobserved in the Lower Step and abyssal floor of the eastern Atlantic\r\n(Bullard, 1954; Bullard _et al._, 1956).\r\n\r\nHigh heat-flow values have also been observed on the Easter Island\r\nRidge of the Southeast Pacific, suggesting that the entire Mid-Oceanic\r\nRidge rift system may be so characterized.\r\n\r\nAn adequate synthesis and explanation of all these converging lines\r\nof evidence has not yet been formulated. However, the correlation of\r\nso many types of geophysical and geological data speaks favorably for\r\nthe validity and tectonic significance of the physiographic provinces\r\ndescribed here.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the observed correspondence of crustal structure and\r\nphysiographic provinces a hypothetical trans-Atlantic structure section\r\nwas prepared (Fig. 49). Seismic-refraction measurements were projected\r\nalong province boundaries and plotted beneath an echo-sounding profile\r\nfrom New York to Spanish Sahara. The black splotched areas represent\r\nthe 7.3 km/sec layer. This velocity intermediate between 8.1 km/sec\r\nof normal mantle and 6.7 km/sec of normal oceanic crust is considered\r\n(1) a mixture of the two normal layers; (2) a low-velocity part of the\r\nmantle, or (3) a distinct crustal layer characteristic of mid-oceanic\r\nridges. The structure shown for the continental margin of Africa is\r\nbased on analogy with the structure of the continental margin of\r\nnortheastern United States. This procedure seems justified by the close\r\nsimilarity of the continental-margin physiographic provinces of the two\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Origin of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge._--Of the many theories which have\r\nbeen proposed for the origin of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge almost all\r\nhave been extremely speculative, and none has been based on any very\r\ndetailed knowledge of the feature. We are still a long way from having\r\na comprehensive knowledge of the Ridge. The various theories of origin\r\nand their factual basis have been briefly reviewed by Tolstoy and\r\nEwing, who conclude that it is impossible to say if the feature is\r\nprimarily of folded or faulted origin. In a paper in press Heezen and\r\nEwing compare in detail the topography and seismicity of the African\r\nrift valleys and the Rift Valley of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Their\r\nconclusion is that the two areas are of basically the same structure,\r\nand in fact both form parts of the same continuous structural feature.\r\nSince the African rift valleys seem clearly to be the result of normal\r\nfaulting resulting from extension of the crust, Heezen and Ewing\r\nconclude that the topography of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is largely\r\nthe result of normal faulting. Whether the forces are the result of\r\nhorizontal extension or vertical uplift remains the most important\r\nunsolved problem in connection with the origin of the continental as\r\nwell as the suboceanic rift-valley systems. Hess (1954) has proposed a\r\nmechanism relating suboceanic uplift to expansion due to serpentization\r\nof the upper mantle.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUB-BOTTOM REFLECTIONS RECORDED ON PRECISION DEPTH RECORDER RECORDS AND\r\nPHYSIOGRAPHIC PROVINCES\r\n\r\nIn some areas of the ocean PDR records show a reflecting surface a few\r\nfathoms below the bottom. Such horizons are observed only when the\r\nsounder is operated with a short (5-millisecond) ping length (in echo\r\nsounding the transmitted sound is called the ping, and its duration is\r\ncalled the ping length). When a long ping is used the first returning\r\necho masks any subsequent echoes occurring less than about 10 fathoms\r\nafter the first echo. To establish continuity of the lower horizon\r\nit is necessary to run the recorder without interruption, sending\r\npings once a second. Since a faulty pinging circuit or some accident\r\nof geometry could conceivably send out two closely spaced pings, the\r\nsupposed sub-bottom echoes must be carefully checked to make sure that\r\nthey are not both bottom echoes from two closely spaced pings. If two\r\npings were being sent out the second echo would always symmetrically\r\nunderlie the bottom surface. If, however, the two surfaces show local\r\nvariations, it can be safely concluded that the deeper one is a true\r\nsub-bottom echo. In order to observe sub-bottom echoes the sea floor\r\nshould be reasonably smooth since in rugged relief side echoes and\r\ncrossing \"highlight\" hyperbolas obscure any sub-bottom echoes which\r\nmight occur. Sub-bottom echoes in the Gulf of Maine have been well\r\ndescribed by Murray (1947). In local inshore areas prominent sub-bottom\r\nechoes recorded by unmodified or slightly modified standard echo\r\nsounders have been used to map basement rocks (Smith _et al._, 1952).\r\n\r\nIn the deep sea, sub-bottom echoes or \"penetration\" are observed most\r\nfrequently in the continental rise, oceanic rises, and the far edges of\r\nthe abyssal plains. Penetration is rare on the open continental shelf\r\nand on the continental slope. As the depth increases, echoes are more\r\ndifficult to obtain, so that records from different depths cannot be\r\ndirectly compared in reference to ease of penetration. It nevertheless\r\nseems to be true that sub-bottom echoes are rare or absent on PDR\r\nrecords from the parts of the abyssal plains closest to the continental\r\nmargin. Penetration in the continental rise is common but frequently\r\nirregular and intermittent. One of the most persistent and uniform\r\nsub-bottom reflecting horizons observed occurs on the outer ridge east\r\nof the Bahamas (south of 30° N.) (Pl. 6).\r\n\r\nRecords from the abyssal plain immediately adjacent to the abyssal\r\nhills (Pl. 13 Fig. 4) and from the flat-floored tongues in the abyssal\r\nhills (Pl. 10) reveal some of the deepest and strongest sub-bottom\r\nechoes. Good sub-bottom echoes are common in the Bermuda Plateau.\r\n\r\nThe sub-bottom reflecting layers frequently crop out, and the overlying\r\nsediments thicken and thin, revealing apparently noticeable variations\r\nin the rate of accumulation of sediments. Outcropping of sub-bottom\r\nlayers on the steeper slopes indicate slumping, while the deepening of\r\nthe sub-bottom reflecting horizon in valleys indicates a greater rate\r\nof deposition. High-frequency sound is normally strongly attenuated\r\nby transmission through sediments. The observation of sub-bottom\r\nreflections with high-frequency sound pulses (12 kc) indicates (1) that\r\nthe surface sediment is uniform and is of low density, and (2) that\r\na fairly sharp density change occurs beneath this surface layer of\r\nlow-density material. In areas such as the outer ridge from 22° to 29°\r\nN. Lat. and the southern Bermuda Rise, it can be safely assumed that\r\nthe upper layer consists of deep-sea red clay. Density measurements\r\non red clay have indicated values of 1.25 to 1.45. The lack of\r\nsub-bottom reflections over the parts of the abyssal plains close to\r\nthe continents is attributed to the numerous sand and silt layers found\r\nin the cores which reflect most of the sound. The occurrence of good\r\nreflections beneath the outer edges of the abyssal plains could be\r\nexplained by either assuming that for a long geologic time no sand-or\r\nsilt-carrying turbidity current has reached this area, or that red clay\r\nis deposited here much faster than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAn extremely prominent sub-bottom reflector observed over a vast area\r\nof the east tropical Pacific has been identified by coring with a\r\n10-cm thick bed of white, vitreous ash. This suggests that sub-bottom\r\nreflections found elsewhere may, in general, represent ash horizons.\r\nThis, of course, would presuppose ash falls so vast that some record\r\nshould have been preserved on land. There is no reason to assume that\r\nthere is but a single cause of deep-sea sub-bottom echoes.\r\n\r\nThe widespread occurrence of the sub-bottom interface on the deeper\r\nisolated rises may be of great importance if it be interpreted as\r\nevidence of a sudden change in sedimentation resulting in a change from\r\nhigher- to lower-density sediment. It is just conceivable, however,\r\nthat some unstable diagenetic process may cause a sudden increase in\r\ncompaction at a depth corresponding to the sub-bottom reflection.\r\n\r\nThe sub-bottom reflections in depths of 2600 fathoms on the southern\r\nBermuda Rise and the outer ridge is about .02 second after the bottom\r\necho, and this indicates a layer about 10 fathoms thick. At a rate of\r\ndeposition of 1 cm/1000 years this change in sediment type would have\r\noccurred 20 million years ago.\r\n\r\nIn a remotely situated oceanic area the factors controlling whether red\r\nclay or _Globigerina_ ooze is laid down are largely related to depth\r\nand temperature of the bottom water. These two factors are related to\r\nthose which control the solubility of the carbonate and thus the type\r\nof bottom deposit. Emiliani and Edwards (1953), from a study of oxygen\r\nisotopes in benthic Foraminifera in Tertiary deep-sea sediments from\r\nthe eastern Pacific, concluded that the temperature of Pacific bottom\r\nwater decreased 8° C. from the Eocene to the present. This should have\r\ncaused a great increase in the solution of carbonate assuming other\r\nfactors unchanged. Sub-bottom reflections then may also be interpreted\r\nas the result of a change in the temperature or the circulation of\r\nbottom water in the deep basin. Extensive, basin-wide sub-bottom\r\nreflectors, whether the result of vast beds of ash or widespread\r\nchanges in pelagic sedimentation, imply events of global importance.\r\nThe further investigation and identification of these reflectors should\r\nproduce data of far-reaching application in geology, climatology, and\r\npaleo-oceanography.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF PROVINCE CHARACTERISTICS\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic Ocean floor consists of three major morphological\r\ndivisions: (1) continental margin, (2) ocean-basin floor, and (3)\r\nMid-Oceanic Ridge. The continental margin is formed by three categories\r\nof provinces which represent (1) the submerged continental platform,\r\n(2) the steep edge of the continental block, and (3) the raised or\r\ndepressed edge of the ocean floor. The topographic detail of the\r\ncontinental margin is predominantly smooth except for the submarine\r\ncanyons and minor irregularities of the upper continental rise. A close\r\ncorrespondence of topography and distribution of recent sediments\r\nis apparent. For example, deep-sea sands are found in the submarine\r\ncanyons and on the canyon deltas of the lower continental rise. The\r\ncontinental slope appears to be a thinly veneered or bare outcrop of\r\nTertiary and Mesozoic sediments. Individual topographic benches can\r\nbe traced for many miles along the strike. On the basis of published\r\ndescriptions and dating of dredged rock, certain prominent benches are\r\nidentified as the outcrop pattern of various Cretaceous and Tertiary\r\nformations. The lower continental rise can be directly traced into\r\nthe outer ridge at Cape Hatteras. The upper continental-rise and the\r\nmarginal-trench provinces lie between the abrupt continental slope and\r\nthe outer ridge. Seismic-refraction measurements in the continental\r\nmargin indicate the greatest thickness of sedimentary rocks under the\r\nupper continental rise. Thus if we consider the initial form as an\r\nunfilled depression it would have been remarkably similar to the form\r\nof the present marginal trenches.\r\n\r\nThe ocean-basin floor lies between the continental margin and the\r\nMid-Oceanic Ridge and consists of the deeper abyssal floor and\r\nthe elevated oceanic rises. On the abyssal floor adjacent to the\r\ncontinental margins are found the flattest surfaces of the earth. These\r\nabyssal plains apparently were built by turbidity-current deposits. The\r\nunburied abyssal floor is represented by the abyssal hills. The oceanic\r\nrises are broad uplifts which rise from the abyssal floor through a\r\nseries of scarps. Oceanic rises are covered with pelagic sediments\r\nexcept locally near islands and seamounts. The crustal structure of\r\noceanic rises differs significantly from the typical abyssal floor in\r\nhaving lower velocities and generally thicker crustal layers.\r\n\r\nThe Mid-Oceanic Ridge is a broad fractured arch whose axis follows the\r\nmedian line of the ocean. It generally covers the center third of the\r\nocean. The ridge provinces are divided into crest provinces and flank\r\nprovinces. The crest provinces include (1) the Rift Valley, a long\r\naxial cleft 15-30 miles wide and 500-1500 fathoms deep; (2) the Rift\r\nMountains which form the sides of the Rift Valley; and (3) the High\r\nFractured Plateau, a rugged plateau which borders the Rift Mountains.\r\nThe flank provinces consist, on each side, of roughly three steps\r\nseparated by large scarps. A seismic belt accurately follows the Rift\r\nValley. The topography of the Mid-Oceanic Ridge seems best explained by\r\nextensive normal faulting. The mid-oceanic Rift Valley connects with\r\nand is probably of the same origin as the African rift valleys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n    AGOSTINHO, J., 1937, Volcanic activity in the Azores: Bulletin\r\n        Volcanologique, v.
