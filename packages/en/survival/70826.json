She stood\r\nthere, leaning on the half-door of her own little caravan, and gazing\r\ndreamily out and away across the sea, the sunshine on her shapely\r\narms--bare to her well-rounded shoulders were they, for she was not yet\r\nquite dressed--sunshine on her rosy cheeks and lips, and sunshine trying\r\nto hide itself in the floating masses of her auburn hair.\r\n\r\nCalm and lovely though the sea was to-day, with its blues and its opals\r\nand its patches of silver--silver borrowed from the sun--this little\r\nlass was not at this moment thinking of the sea at all, much though she\r\nloved it at most times.\r\n\r\nPeggy was wondering if she might venture.\r\n\r\n“What do you think, Ralph?” she said, kneeling down to throw her arms\r\nround the neck of a great blood-hound who lay on a goat-skin on the\r\nfloor, his long, silken ears trailing down at each side of his noble\r\nhead like some fair lady’s tresses, his eyes turned up to his mistress’s\r\nface.\r\n\r\nRalph gave his strong tail an almost imperceptible waggle.\r\n\r\n“I think,” he seemed to say, “it is folly to be out of bed for three\r\nhours yet. Better go back.”\r\n\r\nPeggy glanced at a companionable little clock that ticked on her morsel\r\nof a dressing-table, beneath the dimity-bedecked looking-glass. The\r\nhands were pointing to half-past four. Very early, surely, for a little\r\nmaiden to be out of bed!\r\n\r\nBut Peggy McQueen knew right well what she was about. This was the first\r\nday of May, and all around the camp the green grass was bespangled with\r\ndew. Is it not a fact, that if a young girl dips her face in the dews of\r\nthis merry morning, she will be sweet and beautiful all the glad year?\r\n\r\nNobody in his senses would think of denying this.\r\n\r\nBut Peggy wanted to have pretty arms and pretty feet and legs as well,\r\nand this was the reason she was astir so early. She put on her sandals\r\nnow, and placed a very roguish and bewitching Tam o’ Shanter on the back\r\nof her head. It was a tartan-rimmed Tammy, with a crimson feather in it\r\nwhich had been dropped from the tail of her favourite parrot. Then she\r\nstepped lightly over Ralph, cautiously opened the back door a few\r\ninches, and peeped out.\r\n\r\nNot a soul stirring in the camp: the large caravan stood not far off,\r\nbut the blinds were still drawn. The white tent in which the giant slept\r\nwas not yet opened. Under the caravan was a bundle of straw, and in a\r\nblanket-lined sack thereon was wee Willie Randolph, the dwarf, nothing\r\nout but his small white face and one arm, the latter placed\r\naffectionately round Dan, the lurcher dog. Dan was a person of some\r\nimportance to the camp, for many a hare and rabbit, and many a fat\r\nhedgehog did he supply for the larder.\r\n\r\nBehind, and stretching away and away to the wooded hills on the horizon,\r\nwas a forest of oak and beech and pine trees, with clumps of larch, now\r\nclad in the tender greens of spring, and o’erhung with crimson tassels.\r\nMaking sure, first, that no one was astir, and that Willie was as sound\r\nasleep as everybody else, Peggy closed the door carefully behind her,\r\nand tripped lightly and gaily down the back steps. She wanted to sing to\r\nherself, but dared not just yet. She would do so, however, as soon as\r\nshe got well into the shadow of the woods, because every bird therein\r\nwas singing its _matinée_, and adding its quota to swell the sylvan\r\nmusic of this lovely May morning.\r\n\r\nNow and then there would come a strange panic in the wild bird medley,\r\npresently to be broken by the melodious fluting of the blackbird or the\r\njoy notes of a nightingale, then at once and in all its strength the\r\nfeathered choir commenced again. So bright was the sunshine, so dark the\r\nshadows under the trees, that Peggy could not see a single songster, nor\r\neven tell to a certainty the direction from which any particular\r\nbird-note rang out. The music was all about and around her, and she was\r\nfain now to lift up her happy treble voice and join the chorus.\r\n\r\nShe went wandering on for a while, unheeding and unheeded. No one had\r\nseen the girl leave the camp except the ancient, warty-faced rook who\r\ncame very early every morning to seek for his breakfast near the tent.\r\nHe had not flown away when she appeared. He just said “Caw--caw--caw!”\r\nin a very hoarse voice, which meant “Good-morning, Peggy, and happy I am\r\nto see you!” A dormouse had peeped drowsily out from a hole among the\r\ngrass when he heard her footsteps, but, seeing who it was, he had merely\r\nrubbed his nose and gone on eating his earth-worm.\r\n\r\nBut presently Peggy came to a green glade or clearing, quite surrounded\r\nby spruce trees, with, in the centre, a pool fed by the water of a tiny\r\npurling brook, with crimson wildflowers growing here and there on its\r\nbanks. The water in the pool was not deep, and so clear was it that\r\nPeggy could easily see the sandy bottom, where strange, black,\r\nglittering beetles played at hide-and-seek, and where the caddis-worm\r\nrolled in its jacket of many-coloured gravel.\r\n\r\nThis was just the secluded glade that Peggy had come to seek. She\r\nseated herself on the bank, and taking off her sandals, plunged her legs\r\nup to the knees into the cool water. Then she laved her face, her\r\nshoulders, and her arms. These were all of the same colour--a light\r\nItalian tan--but the rose-tints shimmered through this tan on her\r\ninnocent and sweetly pretty face. Taking from her pocket a dainty little\r\ntowel, she now carefully dried herself.\r\n\r\nThen, laughing in her healthful glee, she skipped playfully over to a\r\nspot where the grass was long and tender and green, and threw herself\r\nboldly among it. The dewy blades brushed cheeks and neck, her arms and\r\nlegs, and dimpled hands and knees.\r\n\r\nShe felt as fresh now as the clear-skinned, speckled trout in the\r\nstreamlet, and as happy as the rose-linnet that sang on a golden furze\r\nbush near her. She must not wipe the dew off, though. Oh, no, that would\r\nhave broken the spell and spoiled the charm. In the sun she stood,\r\ntherefore, and danced and sang till dry.\r\n\r\nThen a spirit of revelry came over her. It would still be a long time\r\ntill six o’clock. She would have time to rehearse for her night’s\r\nperformance--a dance and a song. Happy thought! She would introduce an\r\ninnovation. Back she ran now into the forest and commenced gathering an\r\narmful of the tenderest and prettiest fern-fronds and wild crimson\r\nsilené flowers.\r\n\r\nPeggy, like the thoughtful and handy little maid she was, never went\r\nanywhere without her ditty-bag. No girl who leads a wandering life\r\nshould. It was hanging to her waist, and contained as many knick-knacks\r\nas you might find in an ordinary small work-box. Here were tape and a\r\npair of scissors too, and these were about all she needed at present.\r\n\r\nStanding in the glade close by the pool in which her shapely form was\r\nmirrored, she quickly and deftly adorned her hair with the wild-flowers;\r\nthen she just as speedily made herself a tippet of fern-fronds, which\r\nshe fastened around her shoulders, encircling her knees with fringes of\r\nthe same. She glanced once more into the pool. She was satisfied, for\r\nshe was really beautiful, and would remain so all the year round. Oh,\r\nthe gladsome thought!\r\n\r\nIf I were merely romancing, I would say that the birds of the forest\r\nceased to sing, and listened enraptured to the merry May maiden’s song,\r\nand that they gazed entranced to witness her dance, waving her arms and\r\npirouetting to her own sweet lilt.\r\n\r\nBut the birds did nothing of the sort. Birds are sometimes a trifle\r\nprosaic and selfish, and even the chaffinch will not cease its bickering\r\nlilt to listen to the nightingale.\r\n\r\nWhile Peggy was dancing, she was, I fear, thinking of nothing else\r\nexcept the effect she expected to produce that evening on the minds of\r\nthe rustic lads and lasses who would gather round to see the performance\r\nof “The Forest Maiden,” at the camp of the Wandering Minstrels.\r\n\r\nThe girl’s head was well thrown back as she sang and danced, else surely\r\nshe would have noticed the stealthy approach of two figures that had\r\nemerged from the forest at its darkest side, and were now almost within\r\nfive yards of her.\r\n\r\nThey were both of the medium height, and though dressed in the cow-gowns\r\nof English rustics, were undoubtedly foreigners. They were handsome men,\r\nbut very dark, with shaven faces and an unmistakable look of the stage\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Peggy saw them, she screamed in terror, and attempted to fly,\r\nbut it was too\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “What wouldst thou with me?”\r\n\r\n_Page 45._\r\n]\r\n\r\nlate. One of them had already seized her by the wrist, firmly, yet not\r\ncruelly.\r\n\r\n“Nay, nay, my little fallow deer,” he said, in tones that were meant to\r\nbe soothing, “nay, my beautiful ring-dove, you must not be alarmed.\r\nThere! do not flutter so, pretty bird. We would but speak with you for\r\none short minute. We have seen you dance and heard you sing many\r\nevenings when the pretty flower did not observe us. We are charmed with\r\nthe flower’s performance, and have come to offer her an engagement. The\r\nWandering Minstrels is not a good enough show for your talent. No, you\r\nmust try to get away for one little minute. We offer you a big, big\r\nsalary. We will take you to France, and place you before a large and\r\nadmiring audience in a splendid concert-room. You will have dresses more\r\nbeautiful than you can now even dream of, besides gold and jewels, and\r\nyou will become a rich lady, before whom the gayest knights in fair\r\nFrance will bow. It is a splendid offer for one so young as you.”\r\n\r\n“Do not fear us,” said the other man, advancing a step nearer to the\r\nfrightened and shrinking girl. “We do not wish your answer now. Only\r\npromise, and we shall meet you again, and only of your own free will\r\nmust you come with us.”\r\n\r\nHe extended his arms beseechingly. But at this moment, with a sudden and\r\npainful effort, she wrenched herself free, and fled towards the forest,\r\nshrieking for help.\r\n\r\nAnd help was at hand, and came in the very nick of time to save this\r\nchild, the joy of whose May-day morning had been so suddenly changed to\r\ngrief and terror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nThe Minstrels at Home.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough it wanted a good hour of the time at which Ralph, the splendid\r\nblood-hound, was in the habit of awaking, stretching himself, and\r\nyawning aloud by way of hinting to his little mistress that it was six\r\no’clock, and that all good girls who live in the woods and wilds should\r\nbe opening their eyes, the honest dog did not go to sleep again. He kept\r\nwatching the door and wondering.\r\n\r\n“Where could Peggy have gone at such an early hour?” he thought to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHad she been intending to stay away a long while, she would have dressed\r\nherself and said, “Good-bye, Ralph, and be good till I come back.” She\r\nonly just put on her Tammy, and went gliding out and away.\r\n\r\nA whole half-hour passed, and then Ralph waxed very uneasy indeed.\r\n\r\nHe got up and stood for some time behind the door, sniffing and\r\nlistening, his noble head a trifle on one side. There were no signs of\r\nPeggy in that direction. Then he stood at one of the windows for fully\r\nfive minutes, gazing sideways out at the sea. For his mistress had a\r\nlittle tent she could easily carry, and often went to the beach to\r\nbathe. But he could not see her now, and his anxiety increased. It would\r\nnot have been becoming in so noble a specimen of the race canine to lie\r\ndown and cry. Leave such conduct for tiny dogs, he thought.\r\n\r\nYet she was staying so long. What could be the matter? He walked up to\r\nKammie’s cage with outstretched neck, as if to ask him the question.\r\nKammie was a good specimen of that strange, weird-looking, and old-world\r\nlizard called the chameleon, who stalks flies and little grubs when you\r\nplace him on the grass in the sunshine, or even in your bedroom; who\r\ncrawls about with marvellous slowness and deliberation, just one leg at\r\na time; who changes colour to match his surroundings; who has two large,\r\ncircular eyelids, a bright bead of an eye in the very centre of each,\r\nand possesses the power of looking in two different directions at one\r\nand the same time.\r\n\r\nBut Kammie was still exactly in the same position in which he had gone\r\nto sleep at sunset on the previous evening. No use expecting an answer\r\nfrom Kammie, so Ralph marched to the back door once again, and examined\r\nthe fastenings. He even shook them, but all in vain.\r\n\r\nWith a deep dog-sigh he lay down now; but presently on his listening\r\near, from out the silent depths of the forest, fell a scream so pitiful\r\nand so agonising that Ralph started to his feet, all of a tremble with\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nYes, yes; it was the voice of his dear little mistress! She must be in\r\ndanger, and he not there to protect her!\r\n\r\nOnce again it rose and died away in terror, like the half-smothered\r\nshriek of one in a nightmare.\r\n\r\nThe dog hesitated no longer.\r\n\r\nWith a yelp which was half a bark, and which said plainly enough, “I am\r\ncoming,” he dashed his fore-paws against a window. The glass was\r\nshivered into flinders, and Ralph sprang through, escaping with only a\r\ncut or two, which he minded no more than my brave young reader would\r\nmind the scratch of a pin or a thorn.\r\n\r\nHe ran hither and thither for a few seconds, uncertain.\r\n\r\nBut, see! the noble beast has found the trail, and with nose to the\r\nearth, his long ears touching it, goes speedily onwards in the direction\r\nPeggy had taken. On and on, and he is soon swallowed up in the woodland\r\ndepths. In less than five minutes he is out of the gloom and in the open\r\nglade. He meets Peggy, frightened and fleeing. He dashes past her--no\r\ntime at present for even congratulations.\r\n\r\nNow woe is me for the foremost of his mistress’s pursuers! Ralph bounds\r\nat him, straight for his chest. Down rolls the Frenchman as if struck by\r\na war-rocket, and the blood-hound already has him by the throat. It is a\r\ngurgling scream the man emits--a half-stifled cry for help. Then all is\r\nover. No; the fellow is not killed, for brave little Peggy McQueen,\r\nknowing well what would happen, has retraced her steps, and seized Ralph\r\nby the collar. And this splendid hound lets Peggy haul him off, and the\r\nvillain slowly and timorously struggles to his feet, his shirt-front\r\nstained with blood.\r\n\r\n“_Merci, merci_,” he mutters, meaning “thanks, thanks.” “_Merci_, my\r\nlittle forest flower. I meant not to harm you. _Non, ma petite!_”\r\n\r\nBut little Peggy looked quite the sylvan queen now, standing there\r\nerect on the heath, her hand still on Ralph’s collar, her tippet of\r\nfern-green slightly disarranged, the heightened tints upon her cheeks,\r\nthe sparkle in her eye, with sun-rays playing hide-and-seek amidst the\r\nwealth of her wavy auburn hair. She seemed for a moment to fancy herself\r\non the stage acting in the play. One long brown arm was outstretched\r\ntowards the bush into which the other Frenchman had fled.\r\n\r\n“Go at once,” she cried, in the voice of a tragedienne. “Go! The forest\r\naround us holds no meaner reptile than thou. Go, and thank Heaven that\r\nmy faithful hound has not torn you limb from limb.”\r\n\r\nShe turned as she spoke, and walked slowly back towards the forest,\r\nwhile the Frenchman slunk away to join his more fortunate companion.\r\n\r\nAs he turned to look back at the retreating figure of poor Peggy, he\r\nshook his fist. “_Sacré!_ maiden!” he muttered to himself, “you have now\r\nthe best of it, but--Jules Furet’s time will come. Jules can afford to\r\nwait.”\r\n\r\nJust as she was, without pausing to divest herself of a single green\r\nfern, but joyful now, and with the beautiful hound bounding on by her\r\nside, only stopping now and then to awaken the echoes of the forest with\r\nthe melody of his baying, Peggy ran homewards through the dark wood,\r\nnever even pausing to breathe until she reached the camp and stood for a\r\nmoment to look at the sea.\r\n\r\nThat dear old sea, how she loved it! The Wandering Minstrels, with their\r\ntents and their vans, were in the habit of hugging the shores of Merrie\r\nEngland, only sometimes making a detour of a day or two into the\r\ninterior to visit some country town, but Peggy McQueen was always happy\r\nwhen the sight of the ocean greeted her again on the horizon, with its\r\nships, its boats, and maybe, away in the offing, a steamer, the gray\r\nsmoke trailing snake-like far astern of it. And there were times when\r\nthe sea appeared quite unexpectedly, perhaps while they were jogging\r\nquietly across some bare but beautiful heath, with no houses in sight,\r\nno life near them except the wild birds, the soaring lark or lonesome\r\nyerlin twittering on a bush of golden furze. On such occasions Peggy\r\nwould clap her tiny hands, and say to whoever might happen to be near\r\nher--\r\n\r\n“Oh, look, look! The sea, the darling sea!”\r\n\r\nAnd there it would be, sure enough, though only a V-shaped patch of blue\r\nbetween two distant hills.\r\n\r\nThere was always music to Peggy in either the sight or the sound of the\r\nocean, but when it was far away like this, and she could not hear its\r\nvoice, nor the solemn sound of its waves breaking on rocks or sand, she\r\nalways brought out her mandoline, and played to it, singing low the\r\nwhile in childish, yet soft, sweet treble. There really was poetry and\r\nromance too in the girl’s soul.\r\n\r\nShe did not stand long, however, on this bright May morn to look at her\r\nsea. She was still in a state of great agitation; besides, it was\r\nalready six o’clock, and Giant Gourmand had opened his tent, and was\r\nstanding wonderingly looking at her and Ralph as they approached.\r\n\r\nPeggy ran quickly past him, hardly condescending to listen to his\r\nastonished exclamation of “Hoity toity, little wench!”\r\n\r\nThe giant was generally “awfully nice and good,” but on some\r\noccasions--and this was one of them--absurdly stupid, and she felt she\r\nwould have liked to box his very large ears, just then, only she had no\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nShe hurriedly dressed herself, and soon came down the steps, smiling,\r\nfor anger had no abiding-place in Peggy’s breast. She sat down on a huge\r\ntree-top and beckoned to her audience to step forward. Gourmand threw\r\nhis great bulk at her feet, and the white-faced, sad-eyed boy, Willie\r\nRandolph the dwarf, lay down on the giant’s chest, and crossed his legs\r\nlike a tiny mite of a tailor.\r\n\r\nThe bloodhound also lay down, with his beautiful head upon his paws, his\r\neyes turned up towards his mistress’s face, love in them, that deep,\r\nundying love that only dogs are capable of.\r\n\r\n“Now, all be quiet,” said Peggy. “I have had such a fearful adventure,\r\nand I want to tell you all about it. Ralph there knows all about it\r\nalready, but you don’t, Willie, nor you either, Gourmie, and Johnnie and\r\nDaddy aren’t up yet. Well, listen. This is May morning, you know, and I\r\nwent away to the woods to wash my face in the dew, so that I shall be\r\nbeautiful all the year through.”\r\n\r\n“O hark at the child!” cried the gruff-voiced Giant Gourmand. “Just as\r\nif there were any need for her being more lovely than she is at\r\npresent.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” piped the dwarf, “hark at her! And look at her at the same time,\r\nGourmie! Look at the flowers in her hair! But what flower in all the\r\nforest could be more sweet than she? Fairer is Peggy than the anemone,\r\nthat waves gently by the treefoot when spring zephyrs are blowing, or\r\nfloats coyly on the broad bosoms of yonder pond. Prettier is Peggy than\r\ndog-rose on the hawthorn hedge asleep; more modest than mountain\r\ndaisy--the wee, crimson-tipped flower that met the poet in that evil\r\nhour; more tender than the blossoms of the blue-eyed pimpernel,\r\nmore----”\r\n\r\nBut Peggy stamped her little foot as she bade him be silent, but the\r\nglad look in her eye, and her heightened colour showed that young though\r\nshe was, the maiden could appreciate a compliment as much as e’en a lady\r\nof the court of a king.\r\n\r\n“Silence, small sir, or I shall hie me at once to my caravan, and you\r\nwill sigh in vain for the story of my strange adventure in the dewy\r\nwoods.”\r\n\r\n“And yet, Miss Peggy,” the giant insisted, “hardly can I blame my little\r\nfriend if he waxes both eloquent and enthusiastic in your praise on\r\nthis lovely May morn.”\r\n\r\n“Like Poppies red in the corn’s green is Peggy,” sighed the dwarf.\r\n\r\n“Like moonlight on the ocean wave”--from the giant.\r\n\r\n“Like music trembling o’er the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Or elves that laugh among the ferns.”\r\n\r\n“Like Naiads sporting in the fountain’s spray.”\r\n\r\n“Or cloudlets sailing in the blue.”\r\n\r\n“Like----”\r\n\r\n“Really, gentlemen, I must curtail the exuberance of your poetic\r\nfancies, for poor Ralph and I are getting plaguey hungry.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, sweet maid. We listen to thy voice as to a houri from paradise.\r\nPray proceed.”\r\n\r\n“You deserve not, sirs, to hear me speak. But--I was in the woods, and\r\nhad culled a few fresh wild flowers to--to--well to make a garland for\r\nfaithful doggie here. I paused for a moment at the forest’s edge to gaze\r\nupon the sighing sea, when two villains sprang from their lair and bound\r\nme in their iron embrace. Had I been anything save a poor gipsy girl, I\r\nshould have fainted dead away, and been carried prisoner to some\r\nloathsome den, soon to be shipped to distant France. They offered me\r\nriches untold if I would but go willingly and join the stage somewhere\r\nabroad. My dancing they said would bring down the house, and all the\r\nworld would lie at my feet.\r\n\r\n“But I would not hear of their gold, and jewels, and their gallants\r\ngay.--What should I want with gallants gay?”\r\n\r\n“While you have me, love,” interrupted the dwarf.\r\n\r\n“And me,” sighed Gourmand.\r\n\r\n“Had not honest Ralph rushed to my assistance, I should not now be here.\r\nBut see, my hand is cut, and my wrist is blue and swollen!\r\n\r\n“And that is all my little adventure,” she added.\r\n\r\nThere was silence for long wondering seconds after the child had\r\nfinished. It was broken at last by Willie. He shook a hard, bony fist,\r\nwhich really did not appear to be much bigger than a mole’s white hand.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” he cried, a fire seemed to scintillate in his black, black eyes,\r\n“if _I_ had only been there, Peggy, I would have----”\r\n\r\nIt may never be known what Willie would have done, for the giant\r\ninterrupted his speech in a way that was more comical than polite.\r\n\r\nHe laughed with a gruff “No, no, no!” and a deep-toned “Ha, ha, ha!”\r\nthat stirred the leaves in the bushes near them, and, as he laughed, he\r\nhoisted Willie right up, and on to the sole of one of his monstrous\r\nboots, then extended the leg in the air till the dwarf looked a mere\r\nmidget.\r\n\r\n“There you are! Now we can see you. He, he, he! Ho, ho, ho,! Now we can\r\nsee you, Willie. Stand there and talk down to us what you would have\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\nNothing could have put wee Willie out of countenance. He smiled down\r\nupon Peggy, and his smile was an ineffably sweet one, for dwarf though\r\nhe might be, his face and form were perfect.\r\n\r\n“Peggy, love,” he said, “hand me up your maidenly little mandoline, and\r\nI’ll sing you a song before I come down from my perch.”\r\n\r\nPeggy ran laughing away, and soon returned with the instrument, and,\r\nstill standing there on the sole of the giant’s boot, he went through\r\nhis performance without moving a muscle, and as coolly as if he had been\r\non the platform before an audience of gaping rustics.\r\n\r\nThen, laughing merrily, he sprang through the air and alighted on the\r\ngiant’s great head. But Gourmand’s head was a hard one, and wasn’t hurt\r\none little bit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSweet, soft, melodious music was now heard coming from behind the alder\r\nclump. A sad and plaintive air from Gounod’s “Faust.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” cried Peggy, “that’s Father’s flute; he wants to play us in to\r\nbreakfast.”\r\n\r\nAh, breakfast is a magic word to denizens of the woods and wilds; and\r\nnow the giant, and the dwarf, and Ralph and Peggy, all made a somewhat\r\nunromantic rush for the tent, and were soon seated, laughing and\r\ntalking, at the breakfast-table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nA Forest Play.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tent was really as roomy as a small marquee, though bell-shaped. It\r\nwas part and parcel of the theatrical properties of these Wandering\r\nMinstrels, and came in very handy in many ways during the performance of\r\n“The Forest Maiden,” and other short plays, all of which were composed\r\nby Reginald Fitzroy, or “Father,” as the proprietor of this show was\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nOne of the duties of Giant Gourmand was to pitch the tent, for the fact\r\nis that no one else could have raised it. The canvas once hoisted, old\r\nMolly Muldoon went inside to stand by the pole and balance it until\r\nGourmie went forth and fixed the outer and inner rows of pegs\r\nartistically.\r\n\r\nThe giant slept in the tent at night, all the year round. Indeed, he\r\npreferred to do so, for this reason--he snored louder than a big\r\nbasketful of bull-frogs. He knew that he did so. He snored so loud at\r\ntimes that he awoke himself, and the marvel is that he didn’t swallow\r\nthe pole. Snoring isn’t a poetic accomplishment, and nobody need snore\r\nif the mouth is kept shut. But then giants are--well, giants are giants,\r\nyou know, and have a great many queer ways that smaller people like you\r\nand me haven’t got.\r\n\r\nGourmand had all one side of the table to himself, and when there was a\r\njoint of meat it was his duty to carve it; and, really, with the great\r\nknife and fork in his huge fists he put one in mind of the story of\r\n“Jack and the Bean-stalk,” the tent pole being the stalk. He sometimes\r\nlooked fierce enough to frighten a motor car. “Never mind,” Peggy could\r\nhave told you, “Gourmie is the kindest big lump of a giant ever anybody\r\nknew.” He was nearly always smiling. His smile was an expansive one. In\r\nfun Willie the dwarf used to jump on Gourmie’s knee sometimes with a\r\ntape to measure it. When tired of Willie’s antics the giant would lift\r\nhim off his knee, as one lifts a troublesome kitten, and place him\r\ngently on the ground. But, big as he was, this giant would have stepped\r\naside rather than crush the life out of a beetle.\r\n\r\nFitzroy himself was a strange kind of being, about fifty years old,\r\nsmart and good-looking, with a face that was easy to make up for any\r\ncharacter, old or young, male or female. He came of a very good family,\r\nand might have graced either the Church or the Bar, but for his love of\r\nmusic and wandering. Anybody was Reginald’s friend if he could play some\r\ninstrument well. Reginald Fitzroy’s fad was flute-making. He was always\r\nfashioning a new flute, and, having a persuasive tongue, he generally\r\nmanaged to sell these well.\r\n\r\nBut come, breakfast is waiting, and old Molly has placed a splendid meal\r\nbefore the company to-day. That bacon is done to a turn, the bread and\r\nthe butter are unexceptionable, the eggs new-laid, the coffee ever so\r\nfragrant, and, in addition to all this which the little people may\r\npartake of, Gourmand has a goose’s egg, and the half of a cold roast\r\nhedgehog to finish off with.\r\n\r\nPeggy, after breakfast, had to tell all the story of her adventure in\r\nthe forest to Father and Johnnie. Reginald Fitzroy himself would not\r\nhave listened to the best story in creation until he had first satisfied\r\nthe cravings of nature and worked in a good meal. And Johnnie Fitzroy\r\ntook after the old man. Besides, the boy--a very handsome lad of\r\nfourteen, but tall for his years--had been far away among the rocks\r\nthat morning fishing, with nothing worth mentioning on him, except a\r\npair of brown bare legs and a sou’wester hat, from which the fair front\r\nlocks of his irrepressible hair hung down and wouldn’t be controlled.\r\n\r\nHe was late for breakfast, of course, but he threw down a great string\r\nof flat fish in the corner of the tent by way of apology.\r\n\r\nHis father smiled fondly on his boy.\r\n\r\n“Been up early, lad?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, Dad, ’fore four o’clock. Went to bed at seven last night, you know,\r\njust on purpose.”\r\n\r\n“Did you wash your face in the May dew, Johnnie?”\r\n\r\nThe boy looked at her, half disdainfully. He was a trifle tired, but he\r\nwas very fond of sweet Peggy.\r\n\r\n“Did I wash my face in the May dew, Johnnie!” he answered. “Just think\r\nof a boy doing anything so ridiculously silly. Humph!”\r\n\r\nThen, seeing what looked like a tear in Peggy’s eye, he jumped off his\r\nseat, and ran round the table and kissed her.\r\n\r\n“Never mind me, cousin Peggy. I’m ill-tempered because I’m hungry, and\r\nbecause a lobster grabbed my big toe and cut it. Look!”\r\n\r\nThe toe was still bleeding through the white rag old Molly had bound it\r\nup with.\r\n\r\n“Poor cousin Johnnie!”\r\n\r\n“Never mind, Peg. I brought him home, anyhow, and he is such a monster.\r\nHe is walking about outside your caravan at this moment. Yes, Daddy,\r\nthank you. I love ham and eggs. Gourmie, do I see you well?”\r\n\r\n“There’s plenty of me to see, anyhow,” grunted Gourmand, good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n“Well, don’t take on about it, there’s a little dear. And I’ll have the\r\nhalf of that cold hoggie.”\r\n\r\n“Have the whole of it, lad. And the whole of it is only a half, after\r\nall. Our sweet little Molly is going to cook her Gourmie another goose’s\r\negg.”\r\n\r\nMolly was old, like a withered dock as to colour, but she tried to smile\r\na girlish smile as she went bustling out of the tent now to do the\r\ngiant’s bidding.\r\n\r\nPeggy’s story set Mr. Fitzroy thinking. After breakfast he threw himself\r\nprone upon the tent sofa, with his flute in his hand. This was his\r\nfavourite attitude. His sofa was a very primitive one--three boxes\r\ncovered with a goat-skin and with rugs for pillows--but it served the\r\npurpose very well indeed.\r\n\r\nFitzroy played a little, then mused a little, and kept this up for a\r\ngood half-hour. He could think best when lying down, and the flute\r\nassisted his cogitations. He did not mean to build any flutes to-day, he\r\ntold himself; he would take a forenoon off and be ready for afternoon\r\nrehearsal. The neighbouring village had been well billed, and the giant\r\nhad walked twice through it, dressed as a little charity school-boy with\r\na big, treacle-stained bib on, while Willie, the dwarf, walked in front\r\nof him, and pretended to be his father. “The Forest Maiden” was\r\nemblazoned on every old wall and boarding to be found, so they were sure\r\nof a bumper house. Had not this great show been patronised by all the\r\ncrowned heads of Europe?--so the bills informed one; surely, then, it\r\nwas good enough for Stickleton-on-the-Moor. Fitzroy, without getting out\r\nof the horizontal, played a difficult study from Wagner.\r\n\r\n“Nothing like Wagner for clearing the cobwebs out of the brain,” he\r\nmurmured.\r\n\r\nAnd then he asked himself the question, What had been the meaning of the\r\nmorning’s outrage upon poor Peggy?\r\n\r\nIt was a difficult one to answer, and somehow it brought back to him\r\nincidents in his past life that he would just as soon have forgotten.\r\n\r\nFitzroy had married for love, or something which appeared to have been\r\ncousin-german to that tender passion. He had not married a sweet-faced\r\ndoll with wooden legs, such as you can pick up for twopence in a\r\ntoy-shop, but a more expensive and equally useless commodity, namely, a\r\nyoung girl actress of second-class parts, to whom his flute had given\r\nhim an introduction. Their married life had not been all lavender, for\r\nhe was shiftless, and she was thriftless. But she died when Johnnie was\r\nbut a mere child, and, after this, Fitzroy began to feel around him for\r\nsome work that would not only be a prop and a stay to him, but enable\r\nhim to forget his sorrow. So, somehow or other, he became gradually\r\npossessed of this same show. Then, when Johnnie was only seven years of\r\nage, little Peggy came upon the scene--a child of five summers, but wise\r\nbeyond conception.\r\n\r\nFitzroy was himself a gentleman at heart, although poverty had led him a\r\nlittle way apart from the path of rectitude. I don’t imagine for a\r\nsingle moment that because Fitzroy was one of a troupe of Wandering\r\nMinstrels, and was sometimes classed with the gipsies, that he ever\r\nrobbed a hen-roost, or cleared a clothes-line, or even requisitioned\r\nturnips or potatoes from farmers’ fields. But he had for the sake of\r\nmaking money been something of a betting man, and the way that poor\r\nlittle Peggy had come into his possession was not so creditable to his\r\nsense of honour as it might have been. He never cared to think about\r\nthis. But he had come to love the child quite as much as though she were\r\nhis own daughter--perhaps, considering all he knew of the story of her\r\nlife, a little more, because pity for Peggy was in some measure mingled\r\nwith that love.\r\n\r\nPeggy was _his_ Peggy now, and no one should ever come between the child\r\nand him. He felt at that moment that he could strike down the man who\r\ndared--lay him dead at his feet. He was in reality too shrewd a person\r\nto do any such thing. Striking people down in this fashion is a game\r\nthat does not pay. But the thought had excited him, and he was fain to\r\nappeal once more to his flute, and that never failed to soothe him. What\r\ndid these two men who had accosted Peggy want or desire, anyhow? Were\r\nthey the same who seven long years ago had first--but there! he must\r\ndismiss the thought.\r\n\r\n“Avaunt!” he cried, starting up and walking away from it, as it were,\r\nout and away into the cool summer air, as if he could leave that\r\nthought, leave his care on the sofa behind him.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” he told himself; “some idiots tried to scare the girl, that is\r\nall; some itinerant fern-gatherers wanted to have a bit of fun to\r\nthemselves. That is all. Nothing more.”\r\n\r\nHe played that sweet, tender, Irish air, “The Meeting of the Waters,”\r\nthen picked up his rod, and went off to fish.\r\n\r\nThere was a little heaviness at his heart all day, nevertheless, which\r\nneither sport nor anything else could altogether dislodge.\r\n\r\nBut Peggy had quite forgotten her adventure, even before the rehearsal\r\nwas over.\r\n\r\nThe giant, assisted by Fitzroy, Willie, and Molly herself, was not long\r\nin getting the stage up, and the curtain too. The weather was fine. That\r\nwas good luck; for nothing diminishes a house more speedily than a heavy\r\nshower, or a squall of wind and rain.\r\n\r\nThe Wandering Minstrels had to put up with all that, however, and during\r\nsplendid weather they made quite a pot of money, as the caravan master,\r\nFitzroy, termed it.\r\n\r\nBut a show or travelling theatre of this sort, with a company which was\r\nfar from a powerful one, required a good deal of thought, and some\r\nskilful treatment. For the players had not only to play, but to act as\r\nthe band, the carpenters, and the scene-shifters, and sometimes even\r\ntake two parts in the same play.\r\n\r\nThe orchestra was down under the elevated stage, which was tented or\r\ncovered with tarpaulins. The musicians were hidden from the audience by\r\na screen, and played there before the opening of the piece, and until\r\nsome of their number were required on the stage, when, laying down their\r\ninstruments, they entered the tent, whence steps led on to the boards.\r\nIt was all very simple and nice.\r\n\r\nThe scenery was simple too, and ferns, pine branches, and the\r\nwild-flowers of the forest were worked in most effectually and\r\nartistically.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was this very simplicity that had caused “The Forest Maiden”\r\nto catch on so quickly. For the bucolic mind, or, in simple language,\r\nthe rustic, loves neither ambiguity nor plot. Such as these come to the\r\ntheatre not to confuse his brains--if he has some--with mystery on the\r\nunravelling of a plot. He wants to see and hear what he can understand,\r\nand nothing more. This play, “The Forest Maiden,” which they were led to\r\nbelieve had ravished the senses of every crowned head in Europe, was\r\nprecisely the play for their money. (Front seats sixpence for the\r\n_élite_, or for the lover and his lass; back, threepence; and if anyone\r\nkept loafing about far in the rear and tried to get a treat for nothing,\r\nRalph the blood-hound was sent to reason with him, and this method of\r\nreasoning was always effectual.)\r\n\r\n“The Forest Maiden” was a comedy, combined with a good slice of tragedy,\r\nand a good deal of the rough and ranting fun which the gods in the\r\nlow-class theatres of London so delight in. It was in five acts, not\r\nlong ones, certainly, but full of go, excitement, and strong\r\nsituations, with a vein of true love running all through it like the\r\nblue thread on Government canvas. Oh, dearie me! as old Molly used to\r\nsay, my memory is so bad that I cannot even describe the plot to my\r\nreaders, although I was once present in the New Forest when the play was\r\nput on the boards there.\r\n\r\nLet me see now if I can possibly recollect some little portion of it. I\r\nknow, for instance, that it opened with low, sweet music of violin and\r\nflute, that came welling up from the orchestra beneath the stage, music\r\nso artfully concealed that even I, quick-eared though I be, could not\r\ntell whence it proceeded. At one time it seemed high up among the\r\nwind-stirred, whispering trees, at another it mingled with the sound of\r\nthe sea-waves breaking solemnly on the shingle far in the rear, anon I\r\ncould have felt certain the music was up yonder among the fleecy clouds.\r\nNow so interested was I with the simple scene before me when the curtain\r\nrose, that I soon forgot the music, and simply was content to know it\r\nwas everywhere around.\r\n\r\nThe little Forest Maiden, seated by her cottage door, a rustic porchway\r\noverhung with roses yellow and red, the girl herself not less rustic,\r\nnone the less sweet, Leely she is to name, and she is knitting a\r\nstocking while she sings to herself. So breathless was the audience at\r\nthis moment that you might have heard a pin fall, though it would have\r\nfallen on the grass. Leely presently let that stocking drop in her lap,\r\nand looked for a minute, or more, rather listless and sad. But\r\npresently, “Hist!” she said, with the point of a perfectly shaped and\r\ntiny forefinger on her rosy lips.\r\n\r\nThe great blood-hound, who had been asleep as she sang, raised his noble\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“That footstep! yes, ’tis he. ’Tis young Adolphus the forester!”\r\n\r\nAnd enter the young forester, clad chiefly in buff leather girdled with\r\ngreen, bow and arrows and huge knife. Scarcely can she hide her joy, her\r\nblushes, as Adolphus does an attitude, and throws himself at her feet,\r\none arm placed half-carelessly and half-caressingly across the dog’s\r\nmassive shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Ah! Leely, this is indeed bliss beyond compare!”\r\n\r\n“And yet, Adolphus, though thou knewest I was alone, thou camest not\r\nnear me all day long. Nay, nay, tell me not of thy wild adventures in\r\nthe forest, how thou chased the deer far into its dark depths till lost,\r\nhow----”\r\n\r\n“Stay, Leely, stay! I have sweeter, better news for thee than all that.”\r\n\r\nAnd Leely leaned forward now, a light in her blue eyes, that one only\r\nsees once in a lifetime.\r\n\r\n“Leely!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes. Speak, Adolphus. Why dost thou hesitate?”\r\n\r\n“Leely, I met----”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, I know; some charming girl kirtled all in green and garlanded\r\nwith roses. I hate her. I----”\r\n\r\n“Leely, I met a witch, a real hag, in a cottage of turf and heather--a\r\nwitch with wrinkled skin, and with forest snakes twining round her arms\r\nand chest. And Leely, she told me of thee, and bade me bring thee to her\r\nhut that she might read our fortunes.”\r\n\r\nAnd so on, and so forth--a pretty scene, and rather pretty the language.\r\nThen, with promise to meet in the moonlight to visit the witch, they\r\npart just as the thunder (stage) begins to rattle over their heads and\r\nthe lightning plays around them. Curtain.\r\n\r\nThere is more appropriate music, and, in due time, the scene changes.\r\n\r\nI need not say that Leely is Peggy herself, nor that Adolphus the\r\nforester is bold, handsome Johnnie Fitzroy.\r\n\r\nThe scene changes. It is the witch’s hut we now see, the interior\r\nof--but I suppose I must not tell you any more, reader. You say I\r\n_must_.\r\n\r\nVery well, I’ll take my breath and open a new chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSo Ends the Play.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curtain rises next on the interior of the witch’s hut in the darkest\r\nwoodland depths. The witch (who is none other than old Molly herself,\r\nwith a few more wrinkles, put in with kohl, and bushy eyebrows, beneath\r\nwhich fierce, cruel eyes glare like those of the basilisk. _N.B._--I\r\nhave never seen a basilisk, but I am told its eyes do shine fearfully\r\nand ferociously!) the witch has snakes around her arms that raise their\r\nheads now and then to hiss vengefully. They do so now as the Forest\r\nMaiden enters, hand in hand with Adolphus, and followed by the\r\nblood-hound. The witch raises her head also--she has been spinning--and\r\nsmooths back her elfin locks. The young lovers play their parts well,\r\nLeely looking timid and sweet, Adolphus bold and handsome.\r\n\r\n“What wouldst thou with me, young sir?”\r\n\r\n“I would, mother, have my fortune told me, and that of this fair maiden\r\nby my side.”\r\n\r\nThere is a sort of pandemonium scene here--thunder, blue lightning, red\r\nfire, a terrible smell of burning brimstone, and, in one corner of the\r\nhut, half-hidden by smoke, is a black demon with red ochre eyes, long\r\nforked tail, and all the rest of it. I have strong reason to believe\r\nthat the demon in this scene is none other than the dear little dwarf,\r\nWillie Randolph.\r\n\r\nBut the witch reads the girl’s fortune well enough, apparently. Leely\r\nwould be captured by a fearful giant who dwelt far off in a mountain\r\nrecess, and borne away to his castle. This monster lived upon the flesh\r\nof human beings, and that alone. The flesh of men and women was his\r\nordinary or daily food, but his special treat was that of a maiden young\r\nand fair, whom he first tortured to make her tender, and afterwards\r\nslew.\r\n\r\nIt is just at this part of the witch’s hideous story that a louder clap\r\nof thunder than any which had yet been heard rolled forth, a gleam of\r\nred light is noticed at the back of the stage, with a great cloud of\r\nsmoke which presently cleared away to reveal the head and chest of the\r\ngiant himself, flaming eyes, and teeth as large as tenpenny nails.\r\n\r\nIn the next two acts, adventure follows adventure thick and fast,\r\nboar-hunting, and battles between gipsies and the forest rangers,\r\nsmuggling raids, everything, indeed, calculated to create a sensation,\r\nthe whole mingled and mixed with pretty little love scenes at Leely’s\r\ncottage door.\r\n\r\nThe fifth act opens with a view of the giant’s donjon keep, and there,\r\nlo, and behold! Leely is to be seen tied up by the hair of the head.\r\nThere are other maidens there also, but they appear to be dead.\r\n\r\nGiant and demon enter and pinch the Forest Maiden’s arms, to see if she\r\nis yet tender enough for the table. The other dead figures are probably\r\ndummies, but Leely is life-like and natural.\r\n\r\nBut even now a horn is heard outside the castle walls. Exit the demon,\r\ncoming back almost immediately to tell the terrible giant that his\r\ncastle is surrounded, and that he is called upon to surrender.\r\n\r\nHe seizes a knife, and is apparently about to plunge it into Leely’s\r\nbreast when the demon interferes. A curtain is dropped and the scene is\r\nchanged. The stage seems very much enlarged somehow, and well it need\r\nbe, for here is the whole strength of the company engaged in deadly\r\ncombat, to say nothing of hired supernumeraries.\r\n\r\nThe giant lays about him with his club, and a man falls at every blow.\r\nThe witch herself is here, there, and everywhere, offering incantations;\r\nthere are thunderings and lightnings, and the excitement of the audience\r\nis wound up to the highest pitch. It culminates in a wild burst of\r\napplause, when an archer in buff and green fires an arrow which pierces\r\nthe giant’s heart, and brings him to the ground with a thud which shakes\r\nthe stage. Meanwhile the fierce blood-hound has seized the demon, and\r\ncarried him shrieking into the forest. Adolphus steps as lightly as a\r\nbantam on to the giant’s chest, and, drawing his sword, cuts off his\r\nhead. When he advances to the front of the stage with the dripping head\r\nin his hand, he receives the greatest ovation of this exciting evening.\r\n\r\nWell, the curtain drops at last on the happy meeting of Leely and\r\nAdolphus, who rush into each other’s arms; while the witch, with her\r\ncrutch held over their heads, seems to be blessing both, though what the\r\nprecise value of a witch’s blessing is I have yet to learn.\r\n\r\nThe heroes are called before the curtain. The giant is hissed, and\r\nsmiles a ten-inch smile. The hound is cheered, and so is even with the\r\ndemon, but when Adolphus leads the charming Leely out, the shouting is\r\ndeafening, and the pretty actress is almost smothered with garlands and\r\nbouquets of forest flowers.\r\n\r\nSo ends the play.\r\n\r\nBut not the evening, for the giant afterwards goes through some\r\nwonderful performance with the dwarf. And Johnnie, the youthful athlete,\r\ngives ample evidence of his prowess in swinging dumb-bells and Indian\r\nclubs, all to suitable music. He even lifts the giant off the stage with\r\none hand, while Willie stands on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n    “But pleasures are like poppies spread,\r\n     You seize the flower, its bloom is shed!\r\n     Or like the snowfall in the river,\r\n     A moment white--then melts for ever;\r\n     Or like the borealis race,\r\n     That flit ere you can point their place.”\r\n\r\nThe time is up; the end has come; the curtain drops and the band plays\r\n“God Save the King!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nA Nymph of the Wave.\r\n\r\n\r\n“What I says is this, my dear,” said old Molly to Peggy McQueen, when\r\nshe found her up and dressed next morning at a little past six, “it\r\nain’t nateral, and if you take old Molly’s advice you’ll go back to bed\r\nagain, as fast as you likes.”\r\n\r\n“But you are up yourself, Molly!”\r\n\r\n“I be’s an old crittur, Miss Peggy, and old critturs doesn’t get so much\r\nsleep as the young. ’Sides, Miss Peggy, they doesn’t need it.”\r\n\r\n“But I’m going to the rocks, Molly, to fish. Don’t tell Johnnie, because\r\nI want to be first to-day.”\r\n\r\nOld Molly laughed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, indeed, my dear; Johnnie’s been up this hour and more forbye.”\r\n\r\nThe tide was far back this morning, and there was not a breath of air to\r\nstir the surface of the sleeping sea. It was one vast sheet of leaden\r\ngray, with a haze on the horizon, through which a ship or two was\r\nlooming. Long strips of blackest rock, shaped like needles, jutted out\r\nseawards, and on their extreme points the waves broke lazily. Great\r\nstretches of yellow sand lay between. At the very end of one of these\r\nrocky capes a figure no larger a pigeon could be seen moving about, very\r\nactively indeed.\r\n\r\n“Yonder’s Johnnie,” said Molly.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to him, Molly. Come, Ralph.”\r\n\r\nThe dog bayed, and went bounding round his little mistress. Even Johnnie\r\non the rock point could hear that deep-mouthed sound and knew that his\r\ncousin Peggy was coming, and next minute both she and the hound were\r\nseen feathering across the sands in his direction. The boy’s handsome\r\nface brightened when he saw his child companion.\r\n\r\n“I somehow knew you would come this morning, Peggy.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” said the girl, inquiringly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I knew you wouldn’t go to the forest again to-day, after\r\nyesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but I might!” she answered, mischievously. “You know I’m always\r\ngoing to take Ralph with me now.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you’d better--or--I could come.”\r\n\r\n“A dog,” said Peggy, sententiously, “is often better than a boy. A dog\r\nis quieter, and a dog can bite.”\r\n\r\n“Come, and we’ll fish some more, Peggy, and look at things among the\r\npools of the rock.”\r\n\r\nPeggy sat down and extended her bare legs in front of her.\r\n\r\n“Take my sandals off.”\r\n\r\nJohnnie did as he was told, and slung them over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nThen hand in hand away they went sight-seeing over the rocks and across\r\nthe pools. Ralph was in the water, splashing about and having great fun\r\nwith the jelly-fishes. Sometimes he took a big mouthful of water and\r\nseemed to wonder it was so salt. Had it been fresh, he would have\r\nswallowed some; as it was, he only let it run out of his red jowls\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBut what a world of marine life was to be found among the weeds and in\r\nthe little, sandy-bottomed pools! Shell-fish of every shape and colour,\r\ncrimson medusa, and wee, wicked-looking crabs, like big spiders that\r\nwalked sideways and had their eyes on stalks handy for looking round\r\ncorners; brown crabs, blue crabs, gray and yellow crabs.\r\n\r\nThe seaweeds themselves were most beautiful to behold, specially the\r\ntiny, fern-like ones, that floated pink and sienna in the clear pools.\r\nSometimes, when Peggy put her foot on one of the bladders which float\r\nthe very large algæ, it gave a crack like a small pistol, and quite\r\nstartled her.\r\n\r\nThey spent quite an hour at the seaside; but Peggy couldn’t find a\r\nmermaid, though she felt sure there were little fairy ones, and that\r\nthey dwelt deep down in just such pools as these, and didn’t wear much\r\nclothes, except bits of fringy seaweed around their waists to hide their\r\nfishy tails.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” cried Peggy, suddenly. She was some yards away from her companion.\r\n\r\n“Now you’ve done it,” said the boy. “You want to be a mermaid yourself,\r\nPeggy, I think.”\r\n\r\nBut he fished her out of the pond at once, and tried to wring her frock.\r\n\r\n“No good,” sighed Peggy. “I must take it off and spread it in the sun to\r\ndry.”\r\n\r\nJohnnie helped her, and then made a tippet for her of his own merino\r\nmuffler to cover her bare shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Oh, if you are going to dress me,” said Peggy, pouting, “I must have\r\nsomething more than your merino wrap, though that does feel soft and\r\nwarm.”\r\n\r\nShe ran away a little distance shorewards to a spot where the rocks were\r\nhigher, only stopping just for a moment to wave her hand back to him.\r\n\r\n“Go on shrimping, Jack. I’m going to the green-room to dress.”\r\n\r\nWhen Peggy called Johnnie “Jack,” then Johnnie knew that Peggy meant\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nBut as she stood there for a moment on the top of a boulder, with bare\r\nbrown limbs and laughing face, Johnnie had to allow that she looked a\r\nvery pretty and a very provoking picture. Then she dropped down behind\r\nthe great boulder, and he saw her no more for a time.\r\n\r\n“When I am a man,” said Johnnie to himself, “and have a house or a great\r\ncaravan, or a ship or something of my own, I shouldn’t wonder if I\r\nmarried Peggy.”\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to seek for more shrimps and dabs, or whatever he could\r\nfind. He had a long trident, such as Neptune, the sea-god, is supposed\r\nto carry. He lowered this almost to the bottom of a pool, and whenever\r\nhe noticed the sand stir, down went the three-pronged spear and up came\r\na flat fish. He got several thus, and one wriggley-waggley conger eel.\r\n\r\nWhen he looked up, lo! there was Peggy, standing on her boulder again,\r\nbut how changed! She was Peggy still in face--she could be nothing\r\nsweeter--but her whole body down to the knees, with the exception of her\r\nshapely arms, was covered with a garment of seaweeds; strings of shells\r\nwere around her neck, her arms, and ankles, and her hair was adorned\r\nwith sea-mosses which matched its auburn beauty. Peggy possessed the\r\ngift of “getting up,” but never before had she done anything so perfect\r\nas this.\r\n\r\nJohnnie wasn’t often taken back, but he was now; he merely opened his\r\neyes and said, “Oh, Peggy!”\r\n\r\nThe little minx tripped lightly down and took his trident from the boy’s\r\nhands, then, holding it with the spear-points upwards, she stood on a\r\nrock in the sunlight and began to sing.\r\n\r\nIf there were any fairy mermaids in those pools, I am sure they looked\r\nand listened too.\r\n\r\n“Do you like my new dress, Johnnie, boy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and oh, Peggy, you must sing in it to-night. You look a perfect\r\nlittle nymph of the wave. And now we are going to breakfast, dear\r\ncousin.”\r\n\r\n“What! In this dress of weeds?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and that trident and all. You won’t catch cold, will you?”\r\n\r\n“No, silly; this dress is ever so cool and nice.”\r\n\r\nThe dog went bounding on in front, barking and baying; the children\r\nfollowed, hand in hand as usual, and, as usual, singing.\r\n\r\nThey were _so_ happy. Oh, would that happiness would ever last!\r\n\r\nWhen Johnnie led his cousin into the breakfast tent, Father Fitzroy\r\njumped up.\r\n\r\n“By Jupiter, Peggy McQueen!” he cried, “you’re a genius. You look\r\nsomewhat damp, else, ’pon my honour, I’d take you in my arms and kiss\r\nyou. But, Johnnie, you may do so.”\r\n\r\nBut the saucy little sea-goddess wheeled round, lowered her trident to\r\nthe defensive, and repeated some lines from one of her favourite dramas.\r\n\r\n“Come not near me, sirrah. Advance but one step and you have looked your\r\nlast on yonder sun. Seek to molest me, thou craven coward, and thy\r\nlife-blood dyes the heather!”\r\n\r\n“Sit down, my dearie, sit down,” said Molly; “are ye sure ye won’t catch\r\ncold in them cloes?”\r\n\r\n“I’m going off to write a song. Now, at once.” This from Fitzroy. “The\r\nmusic and words are ringing in my head even now--‘The Seaweed\r\nQueen'--and you shall sing it to-night, my damp little darling. Molly,\r\nkeep my coffee hot.”\r\n\r\nThis evening was Peggy’s benefit, and the “house” was even more crowded\r\nthan ever. The same performance was gone through, and ‘The Seaweed\r\nQueen’ was voted the greatest success of the season.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the morning after Peggy’s benefit the camp was struck.\r\n\r\nStriking camp seems an easy matter, does it not? But, having travelled\r\nin caravans with tents for many a long year, I can assure my gentle and\r\nmy simple reader, that it is not half so easy to get clear away out of\r\none’s pitch as it may seem.\r\n\r\nAll hands had to be called very early to-day. It is no hardship,\r\nhowever, for caravan people to rise betimes. They live constantly in\r\nthe open air, and are wont to consider morning the sweetest time of all\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Wandering Minstrels the trouble of striking camp was\r\nminimised, because everyone had his own duties to perform, and all\r\nobeyed the orders of Father Fitzroy, while he himself worked as hard as\r\nanyone.\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock that morning Willie the dwarf shook himself clear of his\r\nsack, and with his little bugle to his lips sounded the reveille. The\r\nnotes of his horn were very beautiful, as they rose and fell on the\r\nstill air of what was a blue-skied and heavenly morning. They went\r\nswelling over the woods and startled the wild-birds; forest rangers\r\nstill abed heard them and wondered what they were, and fishermen out at\r\nsea yonder, who had been toiling all night at their silver harvest,\r\nturned their weary eyes shorewards and wondered.\r\n\r\nStill with the bugle over his shoulder, Willie, without waiting to note\r\nthe effects of the blast he had blown, hurried away now and neatly\r\nfolded up his sack, and stuck it in its place beneath the two-horse\r\ncaravan. Then he took his bundle of straw away to some distance on the\r\nlee-side of the camp, and coming back, proceeded to hang up all the\r\nbuckets and the field-lamp, and the oil-cans, the vegetable-baskets, and\r\nother odds and ends daintily and neatly on their hooks below the vans.\r\nHe had, moreover, to see that nothing was left lying about the field. In\r\nten minutes’ time the camp-fire was lit and the kettle was filled and\r\nhung over it.\r\n\r\nMolly was soon busy bustling about to prepare the six o’clock breakfast.\r\nMeanwhile, all the theatrical properties were loaded on the cart, which\r\nWillie himself was permitted to drive, for dwarfs are strong for their\r\nsize. By the time this cart was loaded and the quiet horse harnessed,\r\nthe breakfast was ready in the tent. Though a little sorry to leave so\r\nsweet a camping-ground, everyone was more or less excited with the\r\nthought of starting off once more and through the woods in search of\r\nfurther adventures.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the breakfast was a hearty one. If there is\r\none thing in this world that gipsy people can do better than another, it\r\nis making a good show at table. Even Willie the tiny did ample justice\r\nto the good things Providence had placed before him. As for the giant--\r\n\r\n“Well, my children,” he said, “I must confess I like a square meal.\r\nGiven a good breakfast, a jolly dinner, and a hearty supper, no one need\r\ngo hungry if he can only work in a few pints of good fruit between\r\nwhiles, and maybe a few cocoa-nuts.”\r\n\r\nThen Molly cleared away and washed up. She stowed plates and dishes in\r\nthe rack of the big caravan, so neatly that they never even rattled\r\nduring the journey. The mugs that did duty as cups and saucers were hung\r\nin the after-cabin, and knick-knacks placed in cupboards.\r\n\r\n“Now, then, Molly, bear a hand,” cried the giant.\r\n\r\n“I’se ready, Gourmie, my dear, and bless the Lord, lovie, that we’ve got\r\na fine day and a dry tent to pack. To pack up a wet tent is----”\r\n\r\nGourmand seized the big pole.\r\n\r\n“Gee-ho-up!” he shouted; “stand clear, all hands that don’t want to be\r\nsmothered.”\r\n\r\nDown came the tent!\r\n\r\n“Honolulu!” he cried, a moment afterwards. “Where on earth is old\r\nMolly?”\r\n\r\nAnd a faint voice answered him from under the canvas--a skinny leg with\r\na boot on its foot was protruding from under it!\r\n\r\n“I be’s a-scrambling in here, Gourmie. You’ve been and gone and lowered\r\nthe tent right atop of your poor Molly. Oh, my poor old bones!”\r\n\r\nBut Gourmand soon had her clear. Then she helped him to get out the pegs\r\nand to smooth and fold the canvas, till it was all small enough to put\r\ninto the sack--pegs, mallet, divided pole and all. The bag was hoisted\r\non to the cart.\r\n\r\nThen the harnessing of the horses began. Two horses to the great\r\ncaravan, one to Peggy’s bonnie wee one, and one to Willie’s cart. While\r\nthis was being done, the dwarf boy was as busy as a rag-picker. Every\r\nmorsel of paper or string or stick or straw was collected and placed on\r\nthe “burning-heap.”[A]\r\n\r\n[A] A hole dug in the ground in which gipsies burn rubbish.\r\n\r\n“Fire!” cried Fitzroy, as if he stood on a battle-deck.\r\n\r\nWillie scratched a match, and lit his pile, after scattering oil over\r\nit, and in five minutes more it was quite consumed.\r\n\r\n“All ready?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Off!”\r\n\r\nCrack went the whips; round went the wheels, and away rolled the show,\r\nleaving the beautiful sea, with its grays and greens and stretches of\r\nsand, and its wild, weedy rocks behind it.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye!” cried Peggy, waving her little white handkerchief in the\r\nbreeze; “good-bye, dear old ocean; we will meet again another day.”\r\n\r\nThen the silent woods swallowed them up, and the rooks and starlings\r\nalone were left on the old camp pitch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPeggy’s Home upon Wheels.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeggy’s caravan was a very pretty, though small, house upon wheels. It\r\nwas her bed and dressing-room, her study and her boudoir all in one.\r\n\r\nPeggy swung here in a dear little hammock at night. The little\r\nhair-mattress and the bed-clothes were folded and put away in a locker\r\nas soon as she got up, but the hammock was left out. It came in handy at\r\nthe mid-day halt for dinner, to swing beneath the trees. To lie thus,\r\nwith the blue of the sky above and the warm sunlight flittering through\r\nthe greenery of branches, with a book in one’s hand, is indeed to enjoy\r\n_dolce far niente_, and as delightful an experience as any traveller can\r\nenjoy.\r\n\r\nOld Molly was Peggy’s coachman; she slept on the floor of the same\r\ncaravan with Ralph the blood-hound.\r\n\r\nIf you have never seen the inside of a caravan like Peggy’s you scarce\r\ncould believe what a charming room it makes. It was all mirrors,\r\nbrackets, lounges, tiny pictures, photos, and flowers, and at night the\r\nswing-lamp was lit, and the fairy lights shimmered through the foliage\r\nand petals of bright bouquets; it looked like the palace of an elfin\r\nprincess, and pretty Peggy was its presiding genius.\r\n\r\nShe had always Kammie, when Kammie was awake and not stalking flies, and\r\nshe had always Ralph, and to these she used to play and sing. But\r\nsometimes of an afternoon a gentle knock would be heard at the door, and\r\nlo! there was little Willie with his little violin.\r\n\r\n“May I come in, Miss Peggy?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, Willie.”\r\n\r\nThen out came the mandoline. Willie put on the mute, so that the notes\r\nof the violin might be softer, sweeter, and more thrilling. Perhaps\r\nJohnnie would now enter with his clarionet, and throw in a bar here and\r\nthere when it would be most effective. I do believe our little people\r\nenjoyed these chance concerts, as Willie called them, better than\r\nanything else in their wandering lives.\r\n\r\nThe great saloon of the large caravan, with its after-cabin, was simply\r\na villa upon wheels. This was the chief abode of Fitzroy and his son\r\nJohnnie, who took turn about in driving. But Johnnie also acted as\r\ncourier, and as the show took up much time on the road, one of this\r\nsturdy lad’s principal duties was to ride far ahead, towards evening, to\r\nfind a suitable field for the camp or settlement. The horses were all\r\nfed on good oats, and slumbered at night in an extempore stable composed\r\nof bamboo poles and canvas.\r\n\r\nThe caravans on that morning, after leaving their pitch and entering the\r\nforest, passed many a rustic cottage, and so early was it that the\r\npretty rural children rushed to the door just as they had jumped out of\r\nbed, not taking time to dress.\r\n\r\n“Hooray! Hoo-ooo-ray!” they shouted, waving brown, fat arms in the air.\r\n“Hooray, the big, big caravans.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, look at the pretty little one!”\r\n\r\n“And the fairy lady at the window!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, listen to the lion a-roaring for his bekfust.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Maggie, Betsy, Mary, Doddie, come here! Come quick and see the\r\ngiant and the dwarf!”\r\n\r\nThe giant, who was lolling on Willie’s cart, made ogre mouths at them,\r\nand the dwarf shrieked shrilly, and squeaked and squalled like Punch at\r\nthe fair.\r\n\r\nIt was good fun!\r\n\r\nBut how delightful for the youngsters of a village they soon came to,\r\nwhen the whole show was stopped for twenty minutes in the principal\r\nstreet, that the horses might get water, and the giant stretch his legs!\r\n\r\nThe giant was the hero then, and the boys vied with each other as to who\r\nshould get nearest to the giant. The lad who was brave enough to rub his\r\nshoulder against Gourmand’s jacket skirts was considered a hero. To rub\r\nagainst a real giant, was among those simple village lads deemed a feat\r\nto be remembered for ever and a day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere would be no play to-night, for Father Reginald Fitzroy knew his\r\npeople needed rest after the fatigues of that campaign by the sea. The\r\nboys and girls who would have fain crowded into the field and broken up\r\nthe peace of the encampment were warned that it might be dangerous to\r\ncome near, as the wild chameleon was very restless this evening, and if\r\nhe escaped there was no saying what might happen. One lad, however,\r\nventured to inquire what sort of an animal a “chameeling” was.\r\n\r\n“Something like the awful crocodile of the Nile,” replied Johnnie;\r\n“only, instead of seizing his prey with his jaws, he darts forth a\r\nterrible tongue, which is nearly as long as his body, and draws the\r\nvictim in.”\r\n\r\n“Swallers ’em alive, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, swallows him alive, and he is slowly tortured to death in his dark\r\ninside.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment the deep-mouthed bloodhound began to bay and roar, and\r\nall the crowd backed away from the gate in some confusion.\r\n\r\nOnly one brave English boy stopped.\r\n\r\n“I say, gipsy!”\r\n\r\n“Well?” replied Johnnie.\r\n\r\n“I’d like to come inside and foight thee for a farthin’ stick o’ toffy.”\r\n\r\n“No, I won’t fight,” said Johnnie; “but I’ll wrestle you, and if I don’t\r\nhold you down half a minute, then throw you over this five-barred gate,\r\nI will give you sixpence.”\r\n\r\n“Done wi’ thee,” cried the boy, and he stripped to the waist in an\r\ninstant, and confidently leapt over into the field.\r\n\r\nThe juvenile crowd gathered round to see their champion win. They felt\r\ncertain of his success. But when they saw Johnnie stripped, and noticed\r\nhis bulging biceps, and the flesh lumped upon his chest and forearms,\r\nthey began to have their doubts.\r\n\r\nNow Johnnie was a strong lad, but not a freak. There was no\r\nunshapeliness about his muscular formation. And he had that staying\r\npower and nerve which are better even than extra strength. Two villagers\r\n(men) volunteered to see fair play, and after shaking hands the lads got\r\ninto grips.\r\n\r\nThey both kept their wits about them, and showed considerable skill, but\r\nin less than two minutes, Jack--we must call Johnnie “Jack” on this\r\noccasion--cross-buttocked his opponent, and next moment he was on his\r\nback. And Jack held him down for fully a minute, while wild cheers rent\r\nthe air. The boy owned up like a man to being beaten.\r\n\r\n“Shall I throw you over the gate now?” said Jack.\r\n\r\n“N--o, thank you,” was the reply. “I know when I has enough. But shake\r\nhands again. You’re the first chap as has ever ‘downed’ Charlie\r\nCrockett. Shake again.”\r\n\r\nThey shook.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Charlie, “I’ll keep away the crowd, as ye says you’re tired\r\nand needs peace. But----”\r\n\r\n“Well, Charlie?”\r\n\r\n“Well, Jack, as they calls you, couldn’t we just see the beautiful young\r\nlady once?”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure you may,” said Johnnie. (He is Johnnie now, you see.) “Wait!”\r\n\r\nAnd off he ran to camp and saw Peggy. He told her all.\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t you sing just one song at the gate?”\r\n\r\nPeggy could and would, and Willie the dwarf took his fiddle to accompany\r\nher. Standing on a barrow by the gate, the good-natured girl, who was\r\ncharmingly dressed, sang not one song but two.\r\n\r\nWhen the cheering had about finished, the strong boy, whom Jack had\r\nbeaten, jumped into the field and popped a bag into her hand.\r\n\r\n“What’s this?” said Peggy, simply.\r\n\r\n“Them’s lollipops, Miss,” he answered, shyly, “with my love, Miss.”\r\n\r\nThen he ran right away to hide his blushes before the cool and collected\r\nlittle lady had time to thank him for his lollipops and love.\r\n\r\nThey all slept very soundly that night, specially Peggy, until the early\r\nbirds singing and pattering on the caravan roof awoke them to the joys\r\nof gipsy life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPeggy Little Knew What Was Before Her.\r\n\r\n\r\nAh, but a gipsy’s life is not all joys by any manner of means, although\r\nto those so young as Peggy and Johnnie, it is quite the life idyllic.\r\n\r\nFitzroy, the captain of the show, had often enough, like most of us who\r\nare not born with silver spoons in our mouths, to scratch the elbow of\r\ntroublesome care. He had to make his caravan tours pay, and the public\r\nis a most insatiable monster. The public, in fact, is the same with its\r\namusements as it is with its food, the public want to get the biggest\r\nchunk of enjoyment, as well as the biggest hunk of cheese it can\r\npossibly get for its penny, and it likes variety too.\r\n\r\nTherefore Captain Fitzroy had to be for ever on the _qui vive_, and\r\nlooking far ahead of him; and no sooner was one little play put upon the\r\nboards for probably a month’s run, than he had to be thinking and\r\nplanning what he should start next. Some startling innovation, some play\r\nwith a daring plot, wild music, scenic effect and plenty of go and\r\nchange, with a glorious finale. “That was the thing to draw ’em,” as\r\nGiant Gourmand used to remark.\r\n\r\nIt was the immortal Dickens who said that giants were all a trifle weak\r\nabout the knees. Whether that be so or not we will not pause to\r\nconsider, but one thing is certain--Gourmand was not weak about the\r\nhead. He was possessed of gigantic intellect, and he generally carried\r\nit about with him.\r\n\r\nFitzroy and he used to have many and many a consultation as to ways and\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n“What we want, cap’n,” said the giant, “is to keep the pot a-boiling.”\r\n\r\nThis wise remark was made in the evening of the day after Johnnie had\r\nthe grand wrestling match with Charlie Crockett.\r\n\r\n“Pot a-boiling, Mr. Gourmand? Yes, and twenty pots, to say nothing of\r\nnosebags. And they must all be filled at the expense of the public, of\r\ncourse.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, we give them the worth of their money. We give the beggars\r\nvalue.”\r\n\r\n“That we do, and that we must, else the beggars will soon growl and may\r\nscatter the show.”\r\n\r\n“And hitherto,” he added, “we have never known what hunger is. Look how\r\nwell filled out our horses are, and how contented, and how their shins\r\nglitter like the back of a boatman beetle. See how contented our dogs\r\nall are and how happy Ralph is. But, Gourmand, my boy, the day might\r\ncome when things wouldn’t be so comfy with us all. We might be reduced\r\nto starvation and have to kill and eat our horses.”\r\n\r\nGourmand laughed his gruff “Ho! ho! ho!” and added his half-comical “Ha!\r\nha! ha.” “Not,” he said, “cap’n, whilst you have that nut on you. ’Xcuse\r\nme for calling it a nut, sir, won’t you?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Fitzroy sighed a three-to-the-pound sigh and shook his head.\r\n\r\n“The nut is maybe all right, friend, but it strikes me we need a change\r\nof----”\r\n\r\n“A change of programme, cap’n?”\r\n\r\n“No, that isn’t quite what I meant, but a change of audience, a change\r\nof public. This part of England seems getting played out as regards\r\nthe--ahem!--legitimate drama, Mr. Gourmand.”\r\n\r\n“Too near London, eh?”\r\n\r\n“That’s it, I think, and London is a jolly sight too near Paris. Ever\r\nbeen to Yorkshire?”\r\n\r\n“They are rare fine animals up there, sir. But why shouldn’t we make a\r\nproper exodus when we’re about it. For I know that an exodus is in your\r\nnoddle, and you’ll ’xcuse me for calling it a noddle, sir, won’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Noddle or nut, Gourmand, it’s all the same to me. But what, my friend,\r\nwould you think would be the best place to emigrate to?”\r\n\r\n“Why not to Scotland, cap’n? It is the land of chivalry and romance, you\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n    “Land of green heath and shaggy wood,\r\n     Land of the mountain and the flood.”\r\n\r\n“Land of fiddlesticks, Gourmie! Do you think it would pay?”\r\n\r\n“Pay? Ay, all to pieces. Ours is just the sort of entertainment, cap’n,\r\nto draw bumper houses on the outskirts of Glasgow to begin with, and so\r\non to Paisley and Greenock. The Scotch are naturally musical, and they\r\nadore a good play. Needn’t be so much blood and thunder in it either as\r\nfor England here.”\r\n\r\n“We’d have to throw in the kilts though, wouldn’t we, and make our\r\ncompany learn Scotch.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, sir. We’d make fools of ourselves if we did. Believe me,\r\ncaptain, Scotch spoken by English lips never ends but in one thing.”\r\n\r\n“And that is?”\r\n\r\n“Ridicule. But the Scotch will hold out the right hand of friendship and\r\nhospitality to their English brothers if we go as English, and nothing\r\nassume. Brave young Johnnie with his Saxon strength will be a favourite\r\nfirst night. Wee Willie too, with his fiddle, and--well, and the rest of\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n“Including Peggy, Gourmand?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, there, sir. Peggy’s young English beauty, her sweet voice and\r\nwinning ways, will completely take the Scottish heart by storm. There\r\nwill be a furore, sir; she’ll win the day for the lot of us.”\r\n\r\nThere was positively a tear of pride in the honest giant’s eye as he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\nCaptain Fitzroy held out his hand.\r\n\r\n“Gourmand, we’ll go,” he said, “we’ll start to-morrow morning right away\r\nfor Southampton, ship the whole show there to be next heard of in the\r\nsecond city of the Empire.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey had been bearing up for the Midland counties, but now the course\r\nwas altered, and the bows of the first great caravan were headed away\r\nfor the west, or, as a sailor would say, west with a little bit of south\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n“Wherever be we off to now, lovie?” said Molly Muldoon, when she met the\r\ngiant next morning early. He looked full of business, his great\r\nshoulders well square back and strong enough apparently to have lifted\r\nPeggy’s caravan, wheels and all, hands a little begrimed, no hat, hair\r\nlike heather, but a good-natured smile all over his broad and energetic\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“Where be we off to? Eh? Why, my dear little roly-poly Molly, we’re\r\ngoing by sea to bonnie Scotland.”\r\n\r\n“Lauk-a-mussy-me!” cried Molly. “Preserve us all from ’arm. To Scotland,\r\nwhere they all runs wild in short kilts, with red heads and red, bare\r\nlegs. To Scotland, where they kills and eats babies, and serves old\r\nfolks up in a stoo, where----”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Molly, they’ll find you and me pretty tough eating, I’m thinking,\r\neven if they do try us in a stoo.”\r\n\r\n“But, lovie, dear, my pet Gourmie, try to perswade Mr. Fitzroy not to\r\nthrow his life away, and the life of hall of us. Mussy-me, lovie, it’s\r\nterrible.”\r\n\r\nBut terrible or not terrible, that very day they had put five-and-twenty\r\nmiles of east behind them, and pitched at night in a sweet green field\r\nnot far from Midhurst.\r\n\r\nThere was no entertainment that night. But they did lots of billing,\r\nand, early next morning it was evident from the interest the rustics\r\nwere showing round the gate and the fences that a bumper house might be\r\ncounted upon.\r\n\r\nNor were they disappointed. “The Forest Maiden” was new to them here,\r\nand so successful was the entertainment, that, when, on the morning\r\nafter, the rustics saw the tents being struck, they were very much\r\ndisappointed indeed. Just as they were starting, a busy little clergyman\r\nbustled up, and saluting Fitzroy, told him the show was just the sort of\r\nthing he would like to see encouraged, as it kept the people away from\r\nthe public houses, and he would like him to promise that if ever he was\r\nanywhere in the neighbourhood again it would not be one night nor even\r\none week he would stay, to give his (the parson’s) parishioners\r\npleasure, but a month at the very least.\r\n\r\nFitzroy smiled and replied that he would certainly consider the matter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was getting on towards the end of leafy May, May with its glorious\r\nblue spring skies, its green fields and waving woods, its wealth of wild\r\nflowers in meadow-land, and on wayside sward; May with its music of wild\r\nbirds, days of dreamy sunshine, and nights of stars. And Peggy sighed a\r\nlittle, as she looked her last on the rolling trees of England south,\r\nsome miles before they rolled into busy bustling, Southampton.\r\n\r\nPeggy little knew what was before her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n“Dark like a Winter’s Eve.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA change, and what a change!\r\n\r\nFaces and footsteps and all things strange! From the very minute the\r\ncaravans struck the suburbs of great Southampton all the glamour of\r\ngipsy life faded and fled.\r\n\r\nThere were snug villas and well-kept gardens, it is true, and tidily\r\ncropped hedges with here and there a leafy elm, though its stem looked\r\ndark and sooty. But the gardens were far too snug and trim, with their\r\ntiled walks and edgings of box, to suit Peggy’s tastes or Johnnie’s, and\r\non the hedges of privet or hawthorn a wild rose, beautiful beyond\r\ncompare though it be, would scarce have dared to bloom. Then there were\r\ngravelled pavements, with lamp-posts, and, more dreadful than anything\r\nelse, tram-lines, with rattling bell-ringing cars, and shouts of\r\nunromantic conductors.\r\n\r\nThis was civilisation, and the well-dressed clerks or bagmen who went\r\nhurrying along the streets were too busy even to glance at the\r\nprettily-curtained windows of the lofty caravans, though one or two did\r\ncast an admiring glance at the young and beautiful girl with sweet,\r\nlaughing eyes, and wealth of bonnie hair that leaned over the half door\r\nof her little home on wheels and the noble hound that lay on guard\r\nbeside her.\r\n\r\nStreet after street, noise and bustle, stir and din, how these children\r\nof the wilds hated it all, but worse was to come! They passed through\r\nunsavoury slums, where every fourth house was either a public or a\r\npawnbroker’s; where sluts--half dressed sluts with arms akimbo--lolled\r\nat the openings of yawning courts; where ragged children played\r\nbare-headed, bare-legged, in gutters, and idle, unkempt youths smoked at\r\nfilthy corners.\r\n\r\nPeggy kept indoors now, ay, and took noble Ralph in beside her also, the\r\ndog was too good for such grim civilisation as this. And she sighed as\r\nshe thought of the greenery of the woods and fields she had left behind\r\nher. And so, on and on till they reached their pitch at last. It\r\nwas--somewhere, and that is all the girl knew or cared. On a piece of\r\nwaste land in a neighbourhood that was mean, and all about the\r\nshow--which did not open to-night--unwholesome children yelled and\r\nhowled till far into the night.\r\n\r\nMolly Muldoon came into Peggy’s caravan to comfort her, and so did wee\r\nWillie. But they only just sat and talked, for no music could be thought\r\nof to-night. This would but encourage these youthful imps, those\r\ncivilised savages, to stay still longer.\r\n\r\n“It be only for one night, lovie,” said Molly, to comfort her, “bless\r\nyour sweet face, my dearie, you’ll forget all this in after days.”\r\n\r\nBut it took two whole days to load up the show for the far-northern\r\nClyde, days of wretchedness and misery, little food by day and little\r\nsleep at night, and there was neither peace nor pleasure until the big\r\nsteamer got out and away on the blue of the Channel.\r\n\r\nThe weather was fine, the sea smooth, and the vessel made excellent\r\nprogress. It was the sweet time of the year, not only on the land they\r\nhad left, but on the ocean too. Just a day of _mal-de-mer_ or hardly\r\neven that, and then the young people settled down to enjoy themselves.\r\nEverything was so new and delightful to them, and the great steamer--a\r\nmerchantman she was, and rarely carried passengers--seemed bent on\r\nshowing herself off to the very greatest advantage. Clean and tidy she\r\nwas, her flush decks ivory white both fore and aft; her dark funnel\r\ndandified with two stripes of vermilion, and she bobbed and bowed to\r\nevery advancing wave as if she and they were on terms of the utmost\r\nintimacy, which was quite true, or as if she and they had never fallen\r\nout, which was not correct, only whenever they had quarrelled it had\r\nbeen owing to the interference of a third party--the surly wind.\r\n\r\nThe caravans had been taken off their wheels and lay--the largest\r\namidships, with one astern of it, and one--Peggy’s--forward. All day\r\nthese gipsy folks passed in and out of their caravans as if they had\r\nbeen on shore, but at night they were all snugly cabined or berthed\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nHad a real gale of wind arisen, I fear that the show would have been\r\nreduced to matchwood, and perhaps the horses killed. But then a gale of\r\nwind did not arise, and, besides, Fitzroy was well insured, and\r\ntherefore easy in his mind.\r\n\r\nThey were four days and four nights getting up and into the rolling\r\nFirth of Clyde, for they had to go all the way round and south of the\r\nScillies.\r\n\r\nJolly evenings they did spend to be sure. All for love a concert was\r\ngiven every night, and wee Willie, the dwarf, with his friend, Gourmand,\r\nthe giant, performed feats that quite astonished the honest sailors.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that Peggy became a very great favourite before\r\nshe had been four-and-twenty hours on board, and so did Ralph the hound.\r\n\r\nJohnnie sang “Maggie by my Side” with such charming effect that the\r\ntears rolled down the cheeks of Charlie Chat, the skipper’s cabin boy.\r\n\r\n    Here let my home be,\r\n      Upon the waters wide,\r\n    I roam with a proud heart,\r\n      Peggy’s by my side.\r\n    (_Chorus_) My own love Peggy dear, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd Charlie that same evening told Chipps, the carpenter, that if he,\r\nCharlie Chat, had Peggy by his side, he would “sail the seas o’er, and\r\nnever think of returning to the dull shore, not nevermore.” Which was\r\npoetic if not quite grammatical.\r\n\r\nBut everything has an end--a German polony has two by the way--and the\r\nsaucy Sea-Witch arrived alongside the Broomielaw at last, and when the\r\ncaravans were landed, when the horses were put to, and they rolled away,\r\nPeggy waving her white handkerchief from her little stern window back\r\ntowards the ship, Charlie turned tearfully round to Chipps and said--\r\n\r\n“She is faded and gone, Chipps. My love has obliterated, my life’s dream\r\nis a thing of the grizzly past.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be a bally hass,” said Chipps.\r\n\r\nThese show folks were not long in finding out that the working people of\r\nGlasgow among whom they pitched on a beautiful green, dearly loved a\r\ngood play and a pretty song, and it was just as Gourmand had predicted,\r\nthey--especially Peggy--carried everything before them and the money\r\nkept rolling in for weeks on end.\r\n\r\nWee Willie, the sad-eyed dwarf, took every heart by storm, for he was\r\nneither mis-shapen nor deformed, and the music that seemed to float out\r\nof his fiddle was inexpressibly tender and sweet.\r\n\r\nNot only was Willie called out before the footlights every evening, but\r\nhe had to be handed round.\r\n\r\n“Hand roon’ the wee yin,” the audience would cry, and Gourmie had to\r\nobey. Wee Willie was passed around both boxes and pit, and if he\r\nreceived caresses from the ladies he amply repaid them, for he made them\r\nlaugh till the very rafters rang. But he himself didn’t laugh in the\r\nvery least. Oh, no, as serious as a Madonna was he.\r\n\r\nI think that though they admired her, the gallants of Glasgow were a\r\nlittle afraid of Peggy. She was so ethereal, such an ideally lovely\r\nchild, that she looked to them more like a being from another world than\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\nMolly Muldoon was a bit of timber of quite another grain. She acted a\r\nwitch to perfection, but when she was called before the curtain, never\r\nthe much of a witch was about Molly. She gave a wild Irish whoop, the\r\nband struck up a jig, and no Paddy ever danced more merrily than she did\r\nthen. When she was summoned a second time, she placed upon the stage two\r\nbrooms crossed like swords, kilted her “coaties,” and danced Ghillie\r\nCallum to perfection.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about it, Fitzroy’s company not only deserved\r\nsuccess but commanded it.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly a month the show journeyed north, but not until Peggy and\r\nWillie, the two favourites, had bumper-house benefits, and at the finish\r\nthe house rose _en masse_ and sung that beautiful song that so appeals\r\nto every truly Scottish heart--“Bonnie Charlie’s noo awa’.”\r\n\r\nFitzroy and his people would long remember the sweet ringing chorus--\r\n\r\n    Will ye no come back again?\r\n      Will ye no come back again?\r\n    Better loo’d ye canna be,\r\n      Will ye no come back again?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe success of the “Forest Maiden Company” was secured, and their fame\r\nhad gone abroad, so that the very first night, and indeed during all the\r\nweek they appeared in Paisley they received splendid ovations.\r\n\r\nOf course they were but a poor little bit of a show, compared with other\r\ngreat ones that had visited the “City of Thread,” but of their kind they\r\nwere first-class. Anyhow, they pleased the people, and what more can any\r\nof us do?\r\n\r\nOn to Stirling by easy stages, staying for a night and sometimes three\r\nat most villages and towns, and so through Perth, and north and west by\r\nthe great Highland road that leads to Dunkeld and Pitlochry, across the\r\nGrampian Range to Inverness itself.\r\n\r\nBut they were destined never to reach the capital of the Scottish\r\nHighlands, something occurring that completely disorganised the show,\r\nand put acting entirely out of Fitzroy’s head for weeks and weeks to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThey had passed over the highest point of the range, through Dalwhinnie,\r\nsurrounded by its mountains patched with summer snows, with lofty Ben\r\nAlder frowning darkly over the leaden lake, and had reached one of the\r\nsweetest little towns that nestle here in the Scottish Alps. They had\r\ngiven their first performance, which was so successful that they\r\ndetermined to stay for a week.\r\n\r\nTheir pitch was both romantic and beautiful, with wilder scenery around\r\nthem than ever before their eyes had looked upon.\r\n\r\nOn the very second morning Johnnie and Peggy went off through woods and\r\nwilds under the guidance of a ghillie to a lonely little mountain loch\r\nor tarn to fish. Quite surrounded by rocks and birch-clad braes is Loch\r\nBran, and unknown to the Saxon tourist. The glad fish leaped up in the\r\nsunshine as if wanting to be landed, and though by no means adepts at\r\nthe fisherman’s craft, it was not many hours before the little creels\r\nthey carried were nearly full, so they left off to dine in a brown pine\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nIt was very solemn and still here, not a sound to be heard save the low\r\nmurmur of a little silvery cascade that came tumbling down through gray\r\nboulders and brackens green to seek the rest and silence of the lake.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Peggy sat quietly reading, but Johnnie lay on his back\r\ngazing dreamily up at the dark pine branches through the shimmering\r\ngreen of which he caught sight of the blue of the sunlit sky.\r\n\r\nHe was very happy and contented, and so too was Peggy, for she presently\r\nthrew down her book to talk, and both of them began to build many a\r\nbeautiful castle in the air.\r\n\r\n“My idea of happiness,” the boy concluded, “would be to build a house in\r\nsuch a fairy glade as this, and you could come if you liked, Peggy, but\r\nevery day I would sally forth with my merry, merry men to fish in the\r\nlake, and awake the echoes of the forest with my hunting horn, but\r\nreturn at night to dine and to sleep under the greenwood tree.”\r\n\r\nPeggy shook her wise wee head.\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t it be just a trifle uncomfortable when the snow fell,\r\nJohnnie?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! but then we should have music and mirth in the great halls and\r\ndrink horns of wassail by the roaring log-fires! I know I should be\r\nhappy.”\r\n\r\nBy the time the sun was sinking low towards the horizon they were back\r\nagain in camp.\r\n\r\nBut the next day and the day after that found them back again at that\r\nlonesome tarn which somehow seemed to have a great charm for both of\r\nthem. And it was on this particular day that the adventure I am about to\r\nrelate befell the romantic twain.\r\n\r\nThey had lingered longer by the loch side than usual, for not the breath\r\nof a breeze ruffled its surface, and the trout seemed to slumber below.\r\n\r\nBut they made small baskets at last, and taking their rods to pieces\r\ngave them to the ghillie to carry, and set forth now for the forest.\r\n\r\nSo intent were both on the discussion of the meal they had brought with\r\nthem and the trout, roasted gipsy fashion over a fire of wood, that they\r\nnoticed not the rising clouds and gathering gloom, until suddenly a\r\nflash of lightning seemed to extinguish the flames and rolling thunder\r\nreverberated through the woods, re-echoed back from hill and rock. Flash\r\nafter flash, peal after peal, and then fell a darkness like a winter’s\r\neve.\r\n\r\nBut when great drops of rain began to fall, they were glad to be told by\r\nthe ghillie that there was the Kelpie’s can not far off, and so thither\r\nthey followed the lad, and glad was Peggy when she found herself\r\nsheltered from the pitiless storm.\r\n\r\nFitzroy and Gourmand felt very anxious indeed when evening deepened into\r\ndarkness about ten that night, and still the children did not come.\r\n\r\nSeek them they must, and so they rolled themselves in Highland plaids,\r\nand accompanied by two sturdy ghillies as guides, set off to find the\r\nlake, accompanied by Ralph.\r\n\r\nAbout half way to the glen they met little Stuart, the children’s\r\nghillie. He was dragging himself along, and was covered with blood and\r\nmud.\r\n\r\nHe was dazed, too; but at last, sentence by sentence, they managed to\r\nget all the story out of him, and a sad and melancholy one it was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nBloodhound on the Trail.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Och! yes, to be surely, they were all nearly murdered evermore, the bit\r\nladdie Shonnie was killed dead whateffer, and tied to a tree so he\r\nshouldn’t run away at all, and the bit bonnie lassie was rowed (rolled)\r\nin a plaidie and carriet away. Ochne! Ochne!”\r\n\r\n“And who did this terrible thing?”\r\n\r\nStuart wasn’t sure. First he thought they were men, and then he thought\r\nthey were beasties, for their faces were all black and hairy, but now he\r\nbelieved they were “just water-kelpies and nothing else, forbye,\r\nwhateffer.”\r\n\r\nThey found the tarn at last. There is practically no night in Scotland\r\nnorth, at this season, and the sky having cleared now, they found poor\r\nJohnnie soon enough, tied by ropes to a pine tree.\r\n\r\nThe boy was not dead, however, and soon pulled himself together\r\nsufficiently to tell the story more succinctly than the terror-stricken\r\nghillie had done. They had been attacked by two masked men. Peggy had\r\nfainted, while he himself, after being knocked down, was roped and made\r\nfast, and the villains fled west and away with the insensible form of\r\nhis companion rolled in a shepherd tartan plaid.\r\n\r\n“But I am sure, father,” added the brave and sturdy lad, “we can find\r\nthem with Ralph yonder. Had we not forgotten to take him with us, it\r\nwould have been all right.”\r\n\r\n“Well, boy, you had better run back now and wait. Gourmand and I with\r\nthe hound will follow up the trail, and Heaven help them when we lay\r\nhands on them.”\r\n\r\n“Go back, daddie? Me go back and dear Peggie in danger? I’m going with\r\nyou, father, and you may need me. No going back for Johnnie!”\r\n\r\n“So be it, lad, but I fear you are not strong enough after what you have\r\ncome through.”\r\n\r\n“I can only fail, father, then I can rest.”\r\n\r\n“See, cap’n, what is this?” said Gourmand, holding up something black.\r\n\r\n“Why, I declare,” said Fitzroy, “it is a crape mask, wires and all\r\ncomplete. One of the scoundrels must have dropped it. This will come in\r\nhandy, however.”\r\n\r\nThe showman was a man of quick thoughts, and actions that just as\r\nquickly followed. And now was the time for both. He had been much in for\r\nforeign lands, especially in America, and travel in that country\r\nsharpens one’s wits.\r\n\r\nHis right hand passed round towards his pistol-pocket as if by instinct.\r\nYes, it was there, that little friend the revolver, which had saved his\r\nlife ere now. He had money also, therefore was he prepared to go\r\nimmediately on the war-path.\r\n\r\nEncumbered with the child Peggy, the villains could not have got far\r\naway yet, albeit they had many hours’ start.\r\n\r\nThey would have to carry her when she got tired, or stay and hide with\r\nher somewhere. Unless--the thought made him start and turn cold, surely\r\nmurder was not meant.\r\n\r\nHe had shown Ralph the crape mask and bade him go seek.\r\n\r\n“Hie away, good dog,” he said, “wide away, boy. Your little mistress’s\r\nlife depends on your picking up the trail.”\r\n\r\nAfter a snuff or two at the mask, Ralph, with an impatient cry, half\r\nanger, half grief apparently, made a few circles round, muzzle and long\r\nears down, and then with a more joyful yap, set off at a shambling trot\r\nstraight away from the tarn and through the pine wood. It was rather\r\ndark here, but they soon emerged on to a sheep track which led them\r\nupwards in a winding direction until they struck the main road, and\r\nnorthwards went the dog.\r\n\r\nHis progress was rapid at first and it was all Fitzroy and the others\r\ncould do to keep up.\r\n\r\nAnd the showman’s thoughts kept time with his pace. They reverted now to\r\nthe last time an attempt to kidnap poor Peggy had been made. He had\r\ncertainly put that down to the desire on the part of some one to possess\r\nthe girl as a speculation, for she was undoubtedly very clever, not only\r\nas an actress, but a _danseuse_.\r\n\r\nBut this second attempt threw a more lurid light on the affair. Peggy,\r\nalive or dead, was wanted for some other reason. She was in some one’s\r\nway and had to be removed at all risk and all expense. But by whom or\r\nwhy he did not trouble to think for the present.\r\n\r\nMoreover, ten to one, the kidnappers--mere tools doubtless of some rich\r\nman in whose pay they were--were the same fellows who had made the first\r\nattempt, else why did they wear masks?\r\n\r\nShould he send Gourmand off to seek police assistance? Better not, he\r\nthought. The police, although more methodical in their ways of dealing\r\nwith things, would more likely hinder rather than help Fitzroy. They\r\nwould want to deliberate and follow their deliberations up by red-tape\r\ncut-and-dry investigation, and so valuable time would be lost and the\r\nrobbers get off.\r\n\r\nSome such thoughts must have been running through Gourmand’s mind at the\r\nsame time, for he found time to remark--\r\n\r\n“Shall we seek for police assistance, cap’n?”\r\n\r\n“Hang the police!” cried Fitzroy. “In a case like this they would only\r\nbe in the way. ‘Sharp’ is the word, my friend, and they don’t know the\r\nmeaning of it. If this good dog of ours gets me alongside the scoundrels\r\nwho have stolen my poor Peggy we won’t need policemen, Gourmand, nor\r\nhandcuffs either. It will be a dear day’s work for them!”\r\n\r\nOn and on the party went, hour after hour, and it was evident that the\r\nkidnappers were making all the speed possible, for wherever the road\r\nmade a sweep the trail left it, taking a direct course across the\r\nheather until on the road once more.\r\n\r\nExcitement kept the pursuers up, and they thought neither of sleep nor\r\nof hunger.\r\n\r\nThe trail now left the main road and was picked up again in the\r\nadjoining wood. But now for the first time honest Ralph seemed puzzled.\r\nHe made wide circles, sometimes at a trot, sometimes slowly, as if\r\nconsidering and studying every inch of ground.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt, therefore, that for some reason or other the men had\r\nseparated for a time. The _raison d’etre_ was soon apparent for the dog\r\nrushed suddenly on ahead, left the wood and climbed a small hill or\r\nknoll, then came as quickly back and took up the old trail.\r\n\r\nIt was evident enough one of the men had gone up that hill for the\r\npurpose of taking his bearings or looking ahead for something.\r\n\r\nIn less than another half hour, on rounding the corner of a hill, the\r\ntrail now leading along a mere foot-path, they came in sight of a\r\nsolitary hut or shieling, no doubt the sheltering bield belonging to\r\nsome shepherd, and not far below this was a river.\r\n\r\nThe hound made straight for the door of the little hut and paused.\r\n\r\nFitzroy himself advanced cautiously, making the others wait. It was\r\nalready broad daylight, and soon the sun would rise.\r\n\r\nNo sound within, in answer to his knock. But the door was frail, so he\r\nboldly kicked it in, then entered, revolver in hand.\r\n\r\nThe birds had been here but the birds had flown. A fire still burned on\r\nthe rude hearth, and food was on a small table near it, oatcakes,\r\ncheese, and milk. There were two plates, and two knives on the table\r\nalso, but only two, so that it was evident poor Peggy had not partaken\r\nof the frugal banquet.\r\n\r\nWas she dead? Had she been murdered? Fitzroy looked at Giant Gourmand.\r\n\r\n“Only two plates,” he said slowly, pointedly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I know your thoughts, cap’n. But bless your good soul, sir,\r\nthe devils wouldn’t have dared.\r\n\r\n“Come,” he added, “it was nice of them to leave the table so well\r\ncovered, and so abundantly. Mountain goat’s milk, too. Sit in and let us\r\ndo justice to it. We don’t know what is before us. Here, Ralph, dear\r\nboy.”\r\n\r\nBut the hound would not look at food. He had lapped at springs and pools\r\nwhile on the march. That was enough for him; he had work to do. But the\r\ngiant, with Johnnie and his father, made a hurried but hearty meal, and\r\nGourmand, after finishing the milk with some whisky in it, put all the\r\nsolids in his capacious pockets.\r\n\r\n“In case we cross Mount Hunger,” he said, nodding to the boy.\r\n\r\nThey were soon on the trail once more and coming to the edge of the\r\nwater, the hound was once more puzzled.\r\n\r\nHe stretched his neck up, sniffed and howled a little, then he dashed\r\naway along the bank back again to the place where the men stood, then\r\ngave voice, impatiently, and plunging in swam right across.\r\n\r\nJohnnie had been missed for a short time, he was now noticed rowing up\r\nstream towards them in a cobble which he had seen farther down the river\r\non the other side, and to gain which he had boldly swam over. It had\r\nevidently been left there by the kidnappers. But the lad’s keen eyes had\r\ndetected something else that now gave them all heart, namely the\r\nimpression of Peggy’s boots on the soft ground by the river, so it was\r\nevident she was not dead.\r\n\r\nThe trail was once more found and now it was evident from all that had\r\noccurred, and the still burning fire in the shieling hut, the villains\r\ncould not be far ahead, and that, indeed, they might expect to come up\r\nwith them at any moment. Johnnie’s fishing line was formed into a leash\r\nor leader, and this was attached to Ralph’s collar to curb his extra\r\nspeed and impetuosity. Neither the hound nor his owners had much\r\nexperience of this sort of work, and instead of capturing his man or\r\nmen, the sagacious animal might proceed to attack on sight.\r\n\r\nTo keep on the trail, however, was by no means easy work, owing to\r\nstreams of water which the kidnappers had evidently waded, and which for\r\na time destroyed the scent.\r\n\r\nIt led northwards almost directly, and there could be no doubt, now,\r\nthat the object of their ambition was to gain the seashore, and either\r\nto conceal themselves in some town, or get picked up by a boat.\r\n\r\nBy noon, when the sun was at its height, rest became imperative, for the\r\nday had become very hot, and the pursuers quite exhausted. So tying the\r\ndog to a tree, they lay down under its welcome shade and were soon fast\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nWhen they awoke all of a sudden they found themselves very much\r\nrefreshed. But Fitzroy suddenly sprang to his feet and whipped out his\r\nrevolver, for there, not ten yards away under the shadow of another\r\ntree, stood two rough-looking men with guns across their arms.\r\n\r\nThey were keepers, however, and Fitzroy’s mind was much relieved, so was\r\nGourmand’s flask which he had handed to the men. There was only a\r\nspoonful or two left for decency sake.\r\n\r\nAnd “och! and och! and she was a good dram, and what could they do for\r\nthe strangers at all?”\r\n\r\nThese men were wiser far than they looked, and when Fitzroy told them\r\nthe story of Peggy’s abduction they offered their services at once, and\r\nexplained their plans. They were just a dozen miles and a bittock from\r\nthe seashore on a bee-line, but to the left was a town and to the right\r\nanother, with a small cluster of fishermen’s huts on a tiny cove close\r\nby the sea.\r\n\r\nThey, the keepers, would take different roads, one to the western town,\r\nthe other to the left, so as to intercept the kidnappers if they took\r\neither direction, while Fitzroy and the others would keep up the\r\nman-hunt in whichever way the dog chose to lead them.\r\n\r\nLuck favoured them for once, for the brave Ralph, after trotting his\r\nmasters along at the double, for three miles over a high rough\r\nheatherland brought them directly to the door of a shepherd’s cottage. A\r\nwoman answered their loud knocking and they told the story.\r\n\r\n“O, the villains, and it isn’t an hour since they left this place. O\r\ndear, and O dear, and I knew the weeping lassie who would neither touch\r\nbite nor sup wasn’t theirs. And it was the good mind to keep her I had.\r\nBut I made her lie down in my room, and they, the scoundrels, lay before\r\nthe fire, for two hours, and if my husband Donald, and his dog Curlin\r\nhad been at home, sure they would have throttled the pair of them.”\r\n\r\n“And which road did they take, my good woman?”\r\n\r\n“Is it which road, sir? O, sure then, straight for the little clachan by\r\nthe sea.”\r\n\r\nFitzroy slipped a silver coin into her hand, they swallowed a draught of\r\nmilk each, and once more took the road.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sun was in the west but still high over the blue Moray Firth, and\r\nthe purple sierras of Ross and Sutherland, when the tired band paused\r\nfor consultation on the cliff not more than half a mile from the\r\nseashore.\r\n\r\nGourmand, still holding the hound, who seemed anxious to tear on, looked\r\nround at his companions.\r\n\r\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said in his best stagey manner, “the curtain\r\nnow rises on the last act of this beautiful drama ‘The Captive Princess;\r\nor the Giant, the Boy, and the Fairy Hound.’\r\n\r\n“Behold before you the final scene. Down beneath on the green links a\r\nsolitary hut close by a creek. In that hut hide the villains in\r\npossession of the innocent princess. Afar off, the blue sky and blue\r\nsea, and on its bright bosom a sprightly yacht with spreading sails,\r\nheading for the shore. Presently the anchor will be dropped, a boat will\r\nbe lowered and impelled by sturdy rowers, head on towards the creek,\r\nwhere the villains----”\r\n\r\n“Here, my dear fellow, that is enough,” cried Fitzroy impatiently. “I\r\ndon’t doubt that the kidnappers are in yonder hut, but let us be moving,\r\nand that right quickly too, else we’ll lose the game which now seems so\r\neasy to win.”\r\n\r\nNor was there any time to lose or to squander in talking, for already\r\nthe yacht was nearing the shore, and even as he looked, Fitzroy noticed\r\na flag run up to the peak and as quickly lowered again.\r\n\r\nThis signal brought a man right out of the cottage. He stood on the\r\nknoll for a moment, gave one quick suspicious glance around him, then\r\nwaved a shawl and disappeared once more.\r\n\r\nFortunately there were some bushes--a rugged sort of seaside\r\nhedge--betwixt the cliff and the hut, and, like most fishermen’s\r\ncottages, this ran at right angles to the beach, there being no window\r\nin the landward gable.\r\n\r\nIt was along this hedge that Gourmand and Fitzroy approached to the\r\nattack. The giant had furnished himself with a club like a weaver’s\r\nbeam, while the “cap’n” had a stout stick, a stout heart, and his\r\nrevolver. But Johnnie was left concealed behind a tree at the cliff foot\r\nwith strict orders not to let loose the hound unless summoned to do so\r\nby a shrill whistle.\r\n\r\nThe two pursuers now dashed quickly past the window, and knocking at the\r\ndoor loudly demanded admittance.\r\n\r\nEven as they did so they heard out yonder in the bay, the rattle of the\r\nchain as the anchor was let go, and knew there was not a moment to\r\nspare, for a boat would speedily be lowered.\r\n\r\n“Open the door, lads. Your little game is up!”\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nThe fellows inside knew their book.\r\n\r\n“Dash in the door, Gourmand!”\r\n\r\nThe giant’s right shoulder fell on it like a muffled battering ram, and,\r\nat the second blow, it fell with a crash almost on top of those behind\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Up arms or I shoot,” cried Fitzroy.\r\n\r\nThis was a vain threat, and I suppose the kidnappers knew it. For to\r\nhave fired would have endangered the life of poor Peggy.\r\n\r\nBut Gourmand knocked both fellows down as they tried to escape, and the\r\nshowman stood over them with his revolver.\r\n\r\nThe battle was not yet over however. Indeed it had not well begun. There\r\nwas a shout from beach-wards, and the yachtsmen, six in all, were seen\r\nrushing on to the rescue.\r\n\r\nAnd bad would it have gone with Fitzroy and even the giant himself had\r\nnot at that very moment not only Johnnie with the hound, but the two\r\nkeepers arrived to join the fray.\r\n\r\nThat fray would have done an Irishman at Ballyporeen credit, and to have\r\nseen how Gourmand laid around him, flailing right and left, would have\r\nrejoiced the heart of a Cuscerora Indian.\r\n\r\nHe fell at last, however, with a shot through his wrist, and there was a\r\nlull and a few moments’ parley. But fishermen were being attracted to\r\nthe scene and dreading capture, the whole band made good their retreat\r\nto their boat. Soon they were on board and getting up anchor.\r\n\r\nPeggy was saved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nOh, for that Beautiful Summer!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe worthy showman was now more convinced than ever that an enemy\r\nexisted who would move heaven and earth to remove Peggy from his charge,\r\nand she was quite as much to him as if she had been his daughter. He\r\ndetermined, therefore, to keep a more watchful eye over her. She was a\r\nwilful, wandering little maiden, who took everybody to be good even as\r\nshe herself was good. She had no suspicion of evil in any one, because\r\nit existed not in her own warm little heart.\r\n\r\nBut Fitzroy told her now that she must promise never to go away from the\r\ncamp without her bloodhound. Wondering much, the girl made this promise,\r\nand the good fellow breathed more freely now.\r\n\r\nBut for weeks after that strange adventure, they spent a really good\r\ntime in Scotland, and drew in the dollars too, for above all countries\r\nin the world, perhaps, Caledonia is the land of song and poetry. The\r\nlove of beauty lies deep down at the bottom of each far-northern heart,\r\nside by side with sentiment and true patriotism, a flower that can only\r\nbloom in a mountain land.\r\n\r\nThen one day they found themselves all back once more, safe and sound in\r\nEngland, the scenery of which, though less wild than that of its warlike\r\nneighbour, is very sweet and tender.\r\n\r\nSummer would not be leaving here for some time to come.\r\n\r\nThey had given Wales a turn, and lay for a whole week on the beautiful\r\nbank of the Wye. The music of Wales is also Celtic, that is the old, old\r\nmusic, and though the country is now famous for its study of the\r\nclassical, dearly do they love the more simple lilts of the land of\r\nBurns and Tannahill.\r\n\r\nSo Fitzroy did well to introduce Scottish scenes and customs, and\r\nScottish melodies into the little plays he now presented to the rural\r\npublic. At L---- they had one of the heartiest welcomes ever accorded to\r\nthem anywhere, and it was with great reluctance that Fitzroy at last\r\nintimated to a bumper house, that next morning they must start on their\r\nwanderings once again.\r\n\r\n“But we are coming back, my friends,” he concluded, “for never while\r\nlife holds on to burn within our breasts shall we forget the kindly\r\nwelcome we have received in Wales.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo early did they start, on and away over the hills and through the\r\nbeautiful woods, next day, that there was hardly a soul astir to see\r\nthem off.\r\n\r\nThey did not give another entertainment for a whole fortnight. But\r\nnobody was really idle. Indeed, Fitzroy was the busiest of the busy.\r\nWasn’t he building a new play to be put upon the boards late in autumn?\r\nBesides, he spent his leisure time in fashioning flutes. This was most\r\ncongenial employment, and he could think out his drama even as he\r\nworked. The flutes when fashioned were really beautiful instruments, and\r\nthere was in London a firm that knew their value and gave him good\r\nprices. But he received even larger sums for the flutes he sold\r\nprivately.\r\n\r\nWhen they lay for a few days at some village, they billed it, not for\r\nthe play, but for “Peggy the Palmist.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, she had studied palmistry as an exact science. I myself have\r\ndoubts concerning its exactness, but after reading a hand, Peggy made\r\nwonderfully good guesses as to the past and future life of her visitors.\r\nThe bills ran something as follows:--\r\n\r\n                             “THALASSAINE,\r\n\r\n     The world-renowned Child Palmist, will deliver an outdoor lecture\r\n     on Palmistry in the camp of the Wandering Minstrels\r\n\r\n                            On etc., etc.,\r\n                            Admission Free.\r\n\r\n     Thalassaine may be consulted by appointment at her caravan, the\r\n     ‘Little Rover,’ or will attend ladies at their own residences. Fee\r\n     on application.”\r\n\r\nDid the lectures pay? Indeed they did. Though they were free, a\r\ncollection was made to defray all expenses, and after this Peggy would\r\nsing and play, the giant and dwarf went through a short performance, and\r\nJohnnie gave an exhibition with the Indian clubs.\r\n\r\nThen the lecture led to such good business that the Wandering Minstrels\r\noften stayed for three weeks in a nice pitch, which under other\r\ncircumstances they would have left next day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOh, for that beautiful summer that so quickly wore away! And, oh, for\r\nthe charming scenery of the south and the west of Merrie England, which\r\nthey might perhaps never see again!\r\n\r\nShall I describe the scenery in detail which day after day they passed\r\nthrough as the weeks glided over their heads? If I had space, nothing on\r\nearth would please me more, my dear girl and boy readers. Some day\r\nperhaps--yes, some day! Heigho! But I must not seem to sadden you,\r\nchildren, even with a sigh.\r\n\r\nThe events and the incidents of the road were for ever changing. Every\r\nturn of the highway brought before them a new scene--woods draped in all\r\nthe glory of sunshine, high green lights, and darkest foliage; the\r\nsilence of forests, broken only by the songs of the wild-birds or the\r\ncroodling of the ring-doves in the thickets of spruce; the solemn\r\nsilence of moorlands--in spring-time dotted over with the white\r\nblossoming hawthorn or may, and the golden glory of furze that scented\r\nthe air for miles around--in autumn, crimson and purple with heather and\r\nheath; great stretches of greenest grass-land, undulating, charming,\r\nwith maybe a streamlet meandering through them, by the banks of which\r\nrustic divinities in the shape of red or speckled cows waded knee-deep\r\nin buttercups and daisies; cattle and sheep happy together on lone\r\nhill-sides; hares on the heaths, who sat up and quietly washed their\r\nfaces as they gazed at or after the caravans; wild-flowers everywhere,\r\nby the river’s brink, afloat in the river itself, standing erect in\r\ntheir glory of crimson or pink among the bulrushes; wild-flowers on the\r\nmoors, on the mountains, in the fields, by the hedgeways, and covering\r\ngreat patches of level sward through which the brown road went winding\r\nand winding till it climbed mountain and hill perhaps, and disappeared\r\nover its brow, or went rapidly downwards till lost in the rolling\r\nshadows of woodlands; little lakes and lonely tarns near to which they\r\noften made the mid-day halt, and rippling streams, with here a pool and\r\nthere a pool, from which glad fish leapt up into the sunshine.\r\n\r\nSunshine? Oh, yes, sunshine, but not always. There were days of wind and\r\nrain, drizzling mountain rain that soaked the roads, that saddened the\r\nvery horses; wild storms of wind or sudden squalls that at times all but\r\noverturned the great caravan. Then there were the thunder-storms that so\r\ndelighted Peggy, for the louder heaven’s artillery, the heavier the\r\nspate, and the more vivid the lightning, the better pleased were Peggy\r\nand little Willie.\r\n\r\nOn rainy days even with the wind ahead, little concerts would be held in\r\nthe wee caravan, as the horse jogged slowly on. On days like these they\r\ntried to get earlier into camp, and after the tent was erected and the\r\nhorses seen to, an excellent dinner made all hands forget the weariness\r\nof the long, long way they had traversed.\r\n\r\nI pause here--give one more sigh for the summer that passed so soon\r\naway.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne autumn evening they encamped in a field not far from a sweet little\r\nvillage, or rather hamlet, of scattered, old-fashioned, and very Saxon\r\nhouses. The children were as Saxon as the village, fair-headed,\r\nrosy-lipped, bare-headed innocents, with eyes of “himmel blue”;\r\nbeautiful enough were they to dream of.\r\n\r\nThere was an inn here and there in the village, but the streets, as they\r\nmight have been called by courtesy, were so winding and so interlaced,\r\ncrossing here and crossing there, that to walk down any one of them\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n_Page 130._\r\n\r\n“You cowards,” cried the captain.]\r\n\r\nstreamlet and play to it and its water-lilies. The blood-hound was her\r\nconstant companion, hardly ever leaving her side for a moment. Nor did\r\nshe ever go out without Kammie. She never cared much whither she went or\r\nwandered, so long as there was rustic beauty around her, and I daresay\r\nshe was guilty of trespassing as often as not.\r\n\r\nThe sun was declining in the west, and his beams were already shimmering\r\nhorizontally through the tall and leafy elms of a beautiful park, one\r\nafternoon when she came to a tiny Gothic bridge and crossed it. It was\r\nevidently private ground, for there was an air of cultivation everywhere\r\naround, and two snow-white swans sailed up to her and looked sidelong at\r\nher with their wise, soft eyes. These swans seemed to be fifty years of\r\nage, if a day.\r\n\r\nPeggy wandered on and over the grass, past great clumps of brown-stemmed\r\npine-trees, clumps of ferns and rhododendrons, at present out of bloom,\r\ntill she came in sight of a fine old English mansion-house: yellow were\r\nits walls against the green and well-kept lawn, and in the rays of the\r\nfast-declining sun.\r\n\r\nPeggy stopped now and gazed in a bewildered way at the house, then at\r\nall its surroundings. Where had she seen a house something like this\r\nbefore? Was it in a dream, or had the place only some resemblance to\r\nmansions she must often have seen during her wanderings. But no; it must\r\nhave been a dream. She seated herself on a little rustic bench, and\r\nRalph jumped up by her side. Her fingers touched the mandoline. Music\r\nalways clears memory, because it calms the mind.\r\n\r\nShe was singing a song that was sad but sweet. She could not tell who\r\nhad taught her that song, nor where she had heard it, only it welled up\r\nin her memory, and seemed to mingle with the dream that was around her.\r\n\r\nPresently Ralph rose slowly and growled low, but not in an unfriendly\r\nway. Indeed, he was wagging his tail. Peggy looked quickly round, for a\r\ngentle hand was laid upon her shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Dear child,” said a white-haired, kindly-faced, elderly lady who stood\r\nover her, “will you oblige me by playing that air again and singing the\r\nsong? It is an old, old favourite of mine. I will sit beside your noble\r\nhound.”\r\n\r\nPeggy had been used to encores all her life, or ever since she had\r\njoined the Wandering Minstrels, so she readily complied. When she looked\r\nabout again, she noticed that tears had been falling over the lady’s\r\nface. But these were quickly dried.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, dear. Thank you, Thalassaine. You see I know your name. What\r\nis on your shoulder, child? You are smoothing it with one finger.”\r\n\r\nThen the truth flashed upon Peggy’s mind. This gentle-faced lady, with\r\nhair like the winter’s snow, was partially blind.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear lady,” she said, soothingly, and laying her tiny hand on hers,\r\n“are you--I mean, don’t you see quite well?”\r\n\r\n“But,” she added, before she could receive an answer, “this is my pet\r\nchameleon. Johnnie baptised him Kammie. He never speaks nor makes a\r\nsingle sound, but he is quiet in all his ways, and _so_ droll\r\nthat--well, I think Johnnie and I have grown fond of him.”\r\n\r\n“Who is Johnnie?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Johnnie is--just Johnnie.”\r\n\r\n“Naturally, but----”\r\n\r\n“I live in a show, lady, and Johnnie’s the owner’s son. He is very\r\nstrong and good, and nice, and he always calls me cousin. But I don’t\r\nknow why. Father Fitzroy--we all call him Father--brought me to the show\r\nwhen I was very tiny, and that was after mother and father died, you\r\nknow. He told me that. I think you would like Kammie. May I put him in\r\nyour hand?”\r\n\r\nThe lady stretched out her white palm, and immediately she did so Peggy\r\nforgot all about Kammie, and he remained there on her shoulder looking\r\nall round him for his evening meal of unwary flies. Peggy took the hand,\r\nand as she did so a strange and unaccountable thrill ran through her.\r\n\r\n“Ah, little maiden, you are a palmist, and what soft, little, fondling\r\nhands you have. Yes, you may read my palm if you please.”\r\n\r\nIt was a sweet, still evening, the winds whispering through the trees;\r\nand though summer was over, a blackbird still fluted on the hawthorn.\r\nBeauty everywhere around, in the sky, on the trees, and on yonder\r\nlakelet, that shone like a mirror, and reflected the dying glory of the\r\nshrubs that grew around it. But Peggy heard nothing, saw nothing except\r\nthe white palm held out for inspection.\r\n\r\nThe child believed in palmistry as she believed in the Book, and yet\r\noften she found it difficult indeed to read a hand. But now, it was all\r\nso very different, and everything was as clear to her as a landscape in\r\nthe noonday sun. Nay, more, it did not seem to be herself who was\r\ntalking, or rather, I should say, it did not appear to be her own self\r\nthat was accountable for the words she spoke. Something appeared to be\r\ntalking to her--through her, and she was but repeating what she heard.\r\nIt was a soul voice. The child spoke earnestly, as she examined line\r\nafter line.\r\n\r\n“You have had much sorrow and disappointment in life, lady--more, I\r\nmean, than many have. (A sigh from her patient attested to the truth of\r\nwhat she said.) You were born to wealth and riches--you married, but not\r\nthe man you loved--he was reported false--he was true as needle to the\r\npole--he might never talk to you again--you were the bride of\r\nanother--for long years, though you never knew it, he dwelt near to you\r\nin a humble cottage, that he might see you as you passed his garden--an\r\nundying love--but your child, a prattling infant girl of four, made the\r\nhermit’s acquaintance--he had always a flower for her or sweets as she\r\npassed with her maid--and the child became fond of the recluse--became\r\nthe light of his soul--he was never happy on the days she did not\r\ncome--a wild wintry storm raged--the village was blocked for weeks--at\r\nlast the sun shone--bud and burgeon on the trees--bird song in the\r\ncopse--but the blinds were drawn down over the hermit’s windows--he was\r\ngone.”\r\n\r\n“Was he dead?” said the lady.\r\n\r\n“There is one line, dear lady, that I cannot read.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, child.”\r\n\r\n“Months after this, proof of death and a will.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes.”\r\n\r\n“That will left all his wealth to your little daughter--in case of her\r\ndeath it would revert to his brother, a man who lived by his wits, a\r\nbetting man, a man of the world, yet poor. Then, lady, that child was\r\nlost--she had wandered away from her maid and had fallen into a disused\r\npit, where the body was found a month afterwards, recognisable only by\r\nthe clothes she wore.”\r\n\r\nPeggy stopped. The soul voice had ceased to prompt her.\r\n\r\n“I can tell no more,” she said. “All your future seems dark and misty.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, child, and dark will it be when my sight goes--quite dark. I shall\r\nthen have but the past to dwell on. Would it had been a happier one!\r\nBut,” she added, “you have read my hand aright. I hope you will come\r\nhere again often before you go, and that you will write to me. Down in\r\nthat clump of trees is a marble tablet, and under it the remains of the\r\nchild I loved so dearly. Good-bye, little one. Mind you come again\r\nto-morrow. Bring your beautiful dog and your little cold Kammie.”\r\n\r\nAnd so Peggy said “Good-night.” The lady kissed her beautiful hair, and\r\nthough she could not tell why, the tears came with a rush to Peggy’s\r\neyes as she did so.\r\n\r\nJohnnie himself came to meet her, as the shades of evening were now\r\nfalling and the boy was anxious. Peggy sighed sadly as she was told that\r\nFather Fitzroy had ordered an early start for next day. Father Fitzroy\r\nmust be obeyed.\r\n\r\nAnd Peggy had no time then to call on the gentle, white-haired lady. But\r\nthe meeting was one she would never, never forget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPoor Kammie.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummer was done; autumn itself was far spent, and once more near the\r\nsuburbs of a pretty and fashionable seaside town the Wandering Minstrels\r\nhad pitched their camp.\r\n\r\nThe dear old life by the dear old sea had commenced again, and Peggy and\r\nJohnnie were very happy; so, too, was white-faced wee Willie, while as\r\nfor the giant--well, nothing ever put him out.\r\n\r\nFather Fitzroy was jolly enough also, because he was drawing good houses\r\nwith his new play, and selling many flutes. What more could heart of\r\nwanderers wish? Ah! well, nobody ever is altogether content in this\r\nworld, and there were times when Fitzroy thought his life had been\r\nalmost thrown away, and that he might be better off than he now found\r\nhimself--lessee of the “Lyceum,” for instance. But better days might\r\neven be in store for Fitzroy. So he lit another huge cigar, and took up\r\na new flute to see if he could improve it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were woods all round this seaside town, more romantic even than\r\nthe forests about Bootle-super-Mare, because there were hills and rocks\r\nin them, and a rushing river and a waterfall. Although there were but\r\nfew leaves now on the trees, and winds tossed the branches to and fro,\r\nit was pleasant to walk on the silent turf beneath, or to climb the\r\ncliffs and gather the last wild-flowers of the year.\r\n\r\nPeggy was more often alone than with Johnnie Fitzroy during these\r\nrambles. She never asked him to come, and he was a strange and wayward\r\nboy, who never made up his mind to do anything until the last moment.\r\n\r\nThe sea was usually more sullen in temper now, yet Peggy loved it in its\r\nevery mood, and liked to lie on the shingle and watch its waves chasing\r\neach other shorewards, erecting their white manes and spending their\r\nwild-beast fury on the beach. They sang a song that was eternal, and it\r\nwas that eternal song she liked to lie and listen to.\r\n\r\nWas Peggy becoming a dreamer of dreams as she lay by the seashore, the\r\nblood-hound by her side ever watchful, the chameleon on her wrist or\r\nshoulder? I could not say for certain, but I know she sometimes wondered\r\nwhat her future life might be. There were people who lived in great\r\nmansions like that of the snowy-haired lady she had met that day in the\r\npark, and who, simply because they have money, must be happy, because\r\nthey can go where they like, and do what they like--theirs surely must\r\nbe life in a sort of fairyland--the fairyland of wealth and greatness!\r\nWas she herself longing for an existence like this, and if ever it came\r\nto her, would she not look back to the days that had been so happy, in\r\nwoods and wilds, with Kammie, with Ralph, and--well, and with Johnnie?\r\n\r\nShe used to return in the autumn twilight, coming back to camp through\r\nthe town itself, with its clean and beautiful streets, and with\r\neverywhere around her signs of a life in which she mingled not, and\r\nabout which she knew little or nothing.\r\n\r\nThe evenings were colder now, for it was the month of September, and\r\nwhile stars were becoming visible in the blue-green of the east, and\r\nstruggling with the dying glow of the twilight, lights sprang up in the\r\nhouses and villas she passed by, and as people at this seaside resort\r\nseldom drew their blinds down, Peggy, though by no means inquisitive,\r\ncould not help having a peep inside, and a glimpse of the happiness and\r\ncosiness of many a family circle. The crimson or blue hall-lights looked\r\nvery pretty, she thought. How big and rich-like even the great\r\nhall-mats, and the clean, shining linoleum! Here was a pretty cottage,\r\nand its snug drawing-room, and white-haired gentleman quietly reading in\r\nan easy-chair, his wife knitting by the fire, a cat and dog on the\r\nhearth-rug. A peaceful scene! And Peggy sighed, she knew not why. She\r\nwould have liked just such a father and mother as that to tuck her up in\r\nbed of a winter’s night, in a room with a real fire in a real pretty\r\ngrate, and pictures on the walls--to tuck her nicely up, and then,\r\nperhaps, sing soft, sweet lullabies to her till she glided away into the\r\nland of dreams.\r\n\r\nHere is a party in a parlour not quite so pleasant. Yet the room is\r\nbeautiful, and the ladies and gentlemen who stand around the table\r\nplaying ping-pong are well-dressed, and all look happy and gay. And here\r\nagain she paused a minute, to gaze into a room in which were five or\r\nsix fair-haired and pretty young children, each engaged in some parlour\r\ngame, a big black cat right in the centre of the table, and a\r\nhobby-horse in one corner of the room--it was as good as a pantomime.\r\nThen came a great house with great windows, brilliantly lighted with\r\nflittering balls of electric lamps. It was a hotel dining-room, and\r\nthose were the guests all sitting at the dozens of tables, looking like\r\nkings and queens. Waiters bringing silver trays glided hither and\r\nthither, and on the snow-white table-cloth lay silver and gold dishes,\r\nand sparkling glasses, and flowers of every hue. Peggy sighed again, but\r\ncould not even yet say why she did so.\r\n\r\nShe turned and came slowly back. But she increased her speed when she\r\ncame in sight of her own little cosy camp, the tent lit up and as white\r\nas linen, the lights streaming from the caravan windows. She sighed no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nOne night, when everybody was out of the camp, save old Molly and\r\nherself, Peggy sat at the tent table. And Peggy felt very sad, for\r\nKammie, her weird, old-world pet, had been ailing for weeks, and had got\r\nthinner and thinner, and colder and colder. He had taken no food, and\r\nwhen placed on the grass he hardly moved. Indeed, when laid on his side\r\nhe scarcely cared to wriggle into a more comfortable position. He was on\r\nhis little branch of wood, and had gone to sleep with one arm raised,\r\nwhich he did not seem to have the strength to take down again.\r\n\r\nPeggy had been sitting in the tent for hours watching him. She did not\r\neven want to play. Presently she got up, and, followed by Ralph, walked\r\ndown the winding pathway that led from the sea-road and shingle to the\r\ncamp. She leaned over the gate, and as she did so noticed a figure\r\nadvancing. She was a little timid, but Ralph gave voice at once to a\r\nwelcoming bay, and sprang forward to place two friendly paws on\r\nJohnnie’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Johnnie,” she said, when he got close to her; “poor Kammie.”\r\n\r\n“Not dead?”\r\n\r\n“No; maybe not dead, but I’m sure he is going home.”\r\n\r\nThen the innocent child began to sob and cry in her handkerchief.\r\n\r\nJohnnie and she covered the cage up that night. They could not bear to\r\nsee their favourite so very white and with so little colour in his\r\ntail.\r\n\r\nNext morning the change came. Kammie was dead in reality now. The\r\nwonderful circular, brown, wrinkled eyelids that had always been a\r\nbonnie brown were black. The sides only of the body were jet black,\r\nevery other part pale, white almost as snow, only about the gills a\r\nsunset glow of red. The tail was speckled yellow and gray.\r\n\r\nYes, Kammie was beautiful in Death. Stiff and stark he lay in state all\r\nthat day, and on the morning after, they placed him in a little coffin\r\nof cardboard, and he was laid to rest in a grave that Willie had made in\r\na distant corner of the field. And they planted a flower to mark the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nStorm and Wreck.\r\n\r\n\r\n“And what a change it will be, too,” said Reginald Fitzroy to Johnnie\r\nand Willie, while Peggy McQueen sat listening in the tent to every word\r\nthat was said.\r\n\r\nHe had already signed the agreement with the Macgilvray Company to bring\r\nout Peggy on the Australian stage. In her acting and singing she had\r\nmade such progress this winter, that she was certain to cause a\r\nsensation in that new land of sunshine.\r\n\r\nIt was spring again once more; it is a sorrowful thing for anyone who\r\nloves nature, to sail away from his native land when the birds begin to\r\nbuild and sing, and wild-flowers spring wanton, to be loved and admired.\r\n\r\nBut ever since he had met Macgilvray’s agent, Fitzroy had been a\r\ndifferent man.\r\n\r\n“It will be for the good of us all, my dears,” he said, hopefully.\r\n“Peggy will become a queen of the stage.”\r\n\r\nPoor Peggy’s eyes sparkled with delight, but she sighed immediately\r\nafterwards, for she was very fond of her caravan. But then--well, she\r\ncouldn’t be always a child.\r\n\r\nFather Fitzroy had already written a three-act piece for Peggy, and he\r\nhimself believed he would get rich. Willie would be a draw, and the\r\nsplendid blood-hound would work beautifully into the play. Such a chance\r\nwould never come again, he thought--\r\n\r\n    “There is a tide....\r\n     Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.”\r\n\r\nThus Fitzroy, with gestures suited for the occasion. But poor old Mother\r\nMolly took Father Fitzroy down a peg.\r\n\r\n“Which ye doesn’t get Molly to sail for no furrin parts, ’cept heaven\r\nitself when her day comes; there’s no tide but that for her.” And Molly\r\nresolved now to reside with a sister.\r\n\r\nThe caravans would not be sold, but left in comfortable quarters. A show\r\nlike this, Fitzroy said, might be something to fall back upon.\r\n\r\nThe expenses would all fall on Macgilvray’s agent. He pooh-poohed them.\r\nFitzroy would be able to pay him back out of his first week’s\r\ngate-money.\r\n\r\nNo wonder hope rose high. They were\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n_Page 163._\r\n\r\n“She dressed him in flowers.”]\r\n\r\ngoing in a sailing-ship, though. This would be quieter, and though a\r\nlonger voyage, it would be a healthier; and Fitzroy was just old enough\r\nto begin to think of his health and comfort.\r\n\r\nA smart little barque enough, and a kindly skipper; a trader, however,\r\nand ordered to make straight for Rio first, then Buenos Ayres, etc.;\r\nand, at each town he visited, the Wandering Minstrels were to give their\r\ngreat entertainment.\r\n\r\nNothing succeeds like success, and had Fitzroy elected to stay on with\r\nhis company even at Rio, he might have made a pile.\r\n\r\nBut he didn’t. There was a golden future before them all, he told\r\nhimself, when they should reach the land of the Southern Cross.\r\n\r\nThey had troublesome times weathering Cape Horn, and the barque leaked\r\nbadly. Often and often it was all hands to the pump. Pump or drown,\r\nFitzroy phrased it. The children were told nothing about their danger,\r\nand the stormier the weather the merrier they were. Why, in two months’\r\ntime, somewhat to Fitzroy’s consternation, Willie grew a whole quarter\r\nof an inch!\r\n\r\n“If he starts growing,” said Fitzroy to the giant, “he’ll ruin himself,\r\nand hurt me also.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Gourmand, “I suppose you don’t mind me growing, do you?”\r\n\r\n“Goodness sake, Gourmand!” cried Fitzroy; “grow a foot if you want to,\r\nor a yard even would be better.”\r\n\r\nSomehow, when the ship was stretching up north and west into sunnier\r\nseas, she stopped leaking. Seaweed sometimes gets sucked into a leak and\r\nstops it. Ah! then it was a happy and a merry time on board!\r\n\r\nBut another storm arose which drove them far out of their course, which\r\nsplit the sails, and smashed the bulwarks to pieces.\r\n\r\nOne night the mate came to the skipper’s state-room.\r\n\r\n“The ship is sinking, sir, and the men have seized the boats. They are\r\ngoing to leave her, you better come.”\r\n\r\n“You cowards!” cried the captain, springing up and seizing his revolver.\r\n“I will shoot the first man who attempts to leave the vessel.”\r\n\r\nThis was only what the scoundrel of a mate expected. He darted out of\r\nthe state-room and locked the door.\r\n\r\nThe captain was a prisoner, probably to be drowned like a rat in its\r\nhole.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun rose about six next day, like a big, blood orange\r\nshimmering red through the horizon’s haze, the good barque _Vulture_ lay\r\nlike a log upon the water, and reeled like a drunken man. The waves were\r\nhigh, but there was not a breath of wind. Only those smooth,\r\noily-looking billows.\r\n\r\nThe children had to be told of the danger now, for at any time the\r\n_Vulture_ might take her final plunge. But they bore up most bravely.\r\n\r\nThe captain had been set free again, and he, with Fitzroy himself and\r\nthe giant, set about cutting away every stick. Few sailors could wield\r\naxe or adze as Gourmand did. It was splendid to see the splinters fly!\r\nBut thus relieved, and the rolling seas going down, the vessel recovered\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nShe might float a long time yet. But for a time she was at the mercy of\r\nthe currents, or of any breeze that might blow.\r\n\r\nTwo little jury-masts were rigged just to catch the wind, which soon\r\ncame from the south-east, only bits of staysails, but they served the\r\npurpose of keeping her head before it.\r\n\r\nEvery day they kept looking out for the ship that never passed their\r\nway, and every night they burned a light.\r\n\r\nThey spent a terrible time. The sun was so hot that the pitch between\r\nthe planks of the quarter-deck boiled and stuck to the shoes. There were\r\nplenty of provisions, but the mutinous mate and crew had taken most of\r\nthe water and all the rum away in the boats. The remainder of the water\r\nwent bad, and both Peggy and Willie began to pine. Oh, it was pitiful to\r\nsee them, and even to hear the poor, faithful blood-hound appealing in\r\nhis own canine fashion for the water that was not forthcoming. To make\r\nmatters worse, the captain found he was far out of the track of ships,\r\nfar away from any of the ocean’s great highways.\r\n\r\n“But,” pleaded poor Peggy, hopefully, “a ship may come. God may send a\r\nship.”\r\n\r\nAlas! God seemed to have forgotten them, if that indeed were possible.\r\n\r\nOne night, the sky bright with heaven’s jewels, sheet-lightning playing\r\nbehind the low, rocky clouds on the horizon, that seemed to forebode a\r\nstorm, and a phosphorescent light upon the waves, something happened.\r\nThere was a rasping noise coming from beneath the keel, and all motion\r\nsuddenly ceased.\r\n\r\nThe _Vulture_ had grounded on a reef! No one slept two consecutive\r\nhours, and everyone was astir before the sun leapt out of his ocean\r\nbed. But it was not an ocean bed this morning, for in the east, and but\r\na short distance off, lo and behold! a green and beautiful island, with\r\na beach of coral sand, and strange round huts built under tall and\r\nstately poplar trees. A cry of joy burst from every lip. They were\r\nsaved!\r\n\r\nYes, saved from the sea!\r\n\r\nBut on those sands spear-armed savages danced and yelled, brandishing\r\ntheir weapons and waving their naked arms as if to keep them off.\r\n\r\nWhat now would be the fate of the Wandering Minstrels?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWhen the Worst Comes to the Worst.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a welcome sight those cocoa-nut trees were! They only grow in\r\nislands where water abounds, and the young cocoa-nut itself, before the\r\nkernel is formed, contains at least a quart of the most delicious fluid\r\nin the world. No wine is equal to it.\r\n\r\nBut never a boat was there left on board the _Vulture_ to take them on\r\nshore, when they should dare to make the venture, as dare they must, or\r\ndie!\r\n\r\nCanoes with armed natives came towards them, but kept aloof, making many\r\nthreatening gestures. It was evidently their intention to board at\r\nnight, and so the one swivel-gun which the _Vulture_ possessed was\r\nloaded to her adamantine lips, and kept in readiness, and so were all\r\nthe small-arms.\r\n\r\nIt was long past midnight, however, before anything occurred. The stars\r\nwere burning very brightly, specially the Southern Cross, when suddenly\r\nRalph gave warning voice. A fleet of dug-outs was approaching, although\r\nnothing could be seen distinctly, and the gun was immediately pointed in\r\nits direction.\r\n\r\nFirst the savages were warned off: they only came on faster. A rifle\r\nfired into their midst had merely the effect of stopping their progress\r\nfor a moment. In a few minutes they would be swarming up the sides,\r\nknives in hand, and murder in their fierce and fearful eyes.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to have to take the lives of even savages, but needs must\r\nnow, and so the gun gave voice. It was fired into their very midst, its\r\ncanister-shot doing dreadful damage, as the yells of the foe fully\r\ntestified. There were loud shrieks and groans, and speedily all that was\r\nleft of the dark fleet retreated shorewards. But just as speedily the\r\ngun was now loaded, and once more discharged with deadly effect.\r\n\r\nThe natives had probably never heard a gun fired before, nor ever seen\r\nthe face of a white man.\r\n\r\nPresently, when all was still, a rasping on the ship’s side told that a\r\ncanoe was rubbing against her, and Johnnie himself ventured down. There\r\nwas no one in it, and the paddles were gone. But a large calabash of\r\npure water was found. How glorious! God had not forgotten these\r\nshipwrecked wanderers after all, and the savages who had come off\r\nthirsting for blood had brought life instead.\r\n\r\nRalph kept watch. The others slumbered on deck, with the exception of\r\nPeggy, who was hard and fast asleep on the cabin sofa.\r\n\r\nMorning revealed another marvel.\r\n\r\nThe tide had risen and floated the _Vulture_ off the reef and into a\r\ncreek!\r\n\r\nWhen they awoke, to their astonishment, our heroes found woods all round\r\nthem, composed of a species of mangrove, and a far taller, more\r\nspreading tree laden with beautiful, peach-like fruit. The anchor was at\r\nonce let go, lest the returning tide might drift the old barque once\r\nmore out to sea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA council of war was assembled, and it was agreed that unless they could\r\nmake peace with these savages or save themselves by stratagem of some\r\nsort, in all probability they would be unable to hold out many days, and\r\nindeed the tragedy might be but a few hours distant.\r\n\r\nThe wiles of black men, into whose breasts the civilising influence of\r\nreligion has never entered, are many. In this case they must be met by\r\nthe stratagems of whites.\r\n\r\nTo fight for any length of time was impossible. To fight at all was but\r\nto invite death in its ugliest form. If fighting, therefore, must take\r\nplace, it must be a last resource, and to sell their lives as dearly as\r\nthey could. It was for Peggy that all feared most, and dreadful though\r\nthe resolve was, Fitzroy determined that she should not fall alive into\r\nthe hands of those fearful blacks, to be tortured to death, and probably\r\ndevoured afterwards. Though he said nothing of this to Johnnie, he spoke\r\nhis mind quietly to the skipper of the _Vulture_, as well as to Giant\r\nGourmand.\r\n\r\nThey each pressed his hand. They knew well what he meant. Had they put\r\nit in words it would have ran thus: When the worst comes to the worst,\r\nthe last shot shall be for Peggy McQueen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSavages are very superstitious, and next morning when they found the\r\n_Vulture_ gone--no signs of her anywhere--they must have jumped to the\r\nconclusion that the men on board were evil spirits and possessed the\r\npower of disappearing whenever they had a mind to. They evidently\r\nvisited the creek but seldom, or this part of the island was\r\nuninhabited, for the whole forenoon passed away without a sign of a\r\nsavage.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the _Vulture_ determined, nevertheless, to explore his\r\nsurroundings. This man had been a blackbirder in his time, and knew all\r\nthe tricks and the manners of these islanders. The blackbirder is, or\r\nwas, a man who fitted out a vessel in some Australian harbour, and\r\nsailed for these islands, taking the natives off with them, _nolentes\r\nvolentes_, to be used as black labourers. These poor labourers are\r\nterribly treated, and the blackbirder is a meaner, more despicable\r\nwretch than even the slaver.\r\n\r\nSo after the guns were loaded and every preparation made to repel an\r\nattack, he slid over the side and swam on shore.\r\n\r\nThe time passed wearily by on board the _Vulture_, and it wanted barely\r\nan hour to sunset when the captain returned. He came hand over hand up\r\nthe side, smiling, and as soon as he had changed his wet garments he\r\nmade his report.\r\n\r\n“I think,” he told them, “it will be all right for one night at least,\r\nwhatever may happen another day. I have had a strange experience, for I\r\nhave captured an outlying savage.”\r\n\r\n“Was he asleep?”\r\n\r\n“Sound, and I questioned him in his own language, which, as it happens,\r\nI know right well. This part of the island, for miles around, is\r\nuninhabited. It has a bad name. The blackbirders and the natives, he\r\ntold me, had a battle here, and their spirits (gooboos) still haunt the\r\nwoods. This is all in our favour, though gooboos or not gooboos, if they\r\nfind we are here in the flesh they will attack us.”\r\n\r\n“Captain Stransom,” said Fitzroy, “you didn’t murd---- well, kill the\r\npoor savage, did you?”\r\n\r\n“Not much, though I’ve shot many a prettier bird. No, I have him tied up\r\nwith withies--sailors’ knots--in the wood here, and we’ll have him on\r\nboard to-morrow; I expect we can make him useful later on. But to-morrow\r\nwe must fortify our position here, and prepare ourselves for whatever\r\nmay happen. Luckily, there is a stream of pure water not far from this,\r\nand fruit enough for a line-of-battle ship.”\r\n\r\nThis was good news, and innocent little Peggy was happy once more, if\r\nnobody else was.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she cried; “I should like to go and sing and dance to these poor\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! my Peggy, you would never sing or dance any more after that,” said\r\nFitzroy.\r\n\r\nRalph, who slept with one eye open, was on duty again that night.\r\n\r\nAbout two bells in the morning watch, everyone was suddenly aroused by\r\nthe hound’s deep baying. All hands rushed to arms at once, prepared to\r\nrepel boarders. But no attack was made, and no sound was audible to\r\nhuman ear, so the skipper concluded it must have been Tootaker, the\r\nsavage, trying to make his escape.\r\n\r\n“He can’t, though,” he added; “not if he were the devil. Sailors’ knots\r\nand plenty of them!”\r\n\r\nThe only arms these savages possessed were knives and ugly spears, which\r\nthey could throw with great precision.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose in another hour’s time, and, after breakfast, wood was got\r\nup from below and a barricade was built around the quarter-deck. The\r\nsaloon was provisioned, and all the other hatches were battened down.\r\nThey were now in a position to stand a siege, if need were.\r\n\r\nLuck was in their favour, for they noticed two canoes beached near by,\r\nand Stransom, the skipper, with Johnnie, swam over the creek and took\r\npossession of them. There was a shot-hole in the gunwale of each, so no\r\ndoubt those canoes had formed part of the hostile fleet. The paddles\r\nwere in both.\r\n\r\n“The natives,” said Stransom, “must have jumped overboard and left\r\nthese.”\r\n\r\nFirst the prisoner was taken on board, and so well was he treated that\r\nhe told the skipper he never wanted to leave the ship any more, for if\r\nhe returned his people would cook him alive, then gobble him all up, and\r\nlick their lips afterwards. He was a well-formed man, this savage, with\r\na high skull and somewhat full lips, but most intelligent eyes. He wore\r\nonly one garment, of coarse hair stuff. But Peggy liked him from the\r\nfirst, and it seemed to delight the child to play and sing to him.\r\n\r\nTootaker glared at her with his black eyes and said, “Oo! oo! Yum! yum!”\r\nbut whether he was enraptured with the music, or was thinking how nice\r\nPeggy would be to eat, I cannot say for certain. “Yum! yum!” means so\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nThe two canoes came in very handy, and that forenoon the ship’s chief\r\nwater-tank was filled.\r\n\r\nAt first the blood-hound was very suspicious of Tootaker, and Tootaker\r\nlooked upon the dog as some fearful wild beast. But they soon became\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThis savage, in conversation with Stransom, said his people had taken\r\nthe ship for a blackbirder, and were determined to slay every man on\r\nboard. This was not very comforting, and for the present, at all events,\r\nthe best thing that our heroes could do was to lie _perdu_. “Defence not\r\ndefiance” must now be their motto. Stratagem might come in afterwards.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo say the least--the position of Fitzroy and his friends was one that\r\ncould not be envied.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand they had water and provisions enough to last them for a\r\nvery long time indeed, but they were literally in a stage of seige.\r\nThere was no saying what might occur at any moment. Not less than five\r\nhundred wild natives lived on this lonesome isle of the Pacific, which\r\nwas so far out of the usual track of trading vessels that there was\r\nlittle chance of its being visited, unless a ship should happen to be\r\ndriven out of its course as the _Vulture_ had been.\r\n\r\nThe island was certainly not a large one, probably only about five miles\r\nin any one direction, very irregular and wooded in parts. Although the\r\nsea was swarming with sharks, there were no wild beasts in it larger\r\nthan a species of rock-rabbit, but turtles abounded, and there were\r\nthousands of wild-fowl. Bar an accident to their magazine, there was but\r\nlittle danger of their being starved, and the ship was now dry and\r\ntrustworthy, being no longer strained and buffeted by the waves.\r\n\r\nBut oh! the lonesomeness of the situation; for they were afraid even to\r\nput out a little way to sea in the canoes, lest their position should be\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nWhen a whole fortnight passed away and absolutely nothing occurred,\r\nexcept one tropical storm, which served to break the monotony, all\r\nagreed that the life was becoming unbearable. The giant became morose,\r\nWillie looked as sad as if he had been heat-struck, and would sit\r\nforward in the fo’c’sle for two hours at a time silently gazing into the\r\nwater. Even Peggy lost heart and seldom touched her mandoline. And\r\nJohnnie, who was evidently forcing himself to keep up his spirits, tried\r\nin vain to rouse Peggy from her lethargy. Ralph would get up often and\r\nstretch himself and yawn, but he had no heart to romp. He would walk\r\nover to Peggy, and placing his great head in her lap, look up in her\r\nface with his beautiful, beseeching eyes, as much as to say: “Dear\r\nlittle mistress, how long is this going to last? When are we going back\r\nto the wild woods, the tent, and the little caravan?” The child believed\r\nshe knew what he was thinking about, and as she bent down to kiss his\r\nnoble brow, her eyes were wet with tears.\r\n\r\n“And is this to be the end of all my ambition?” thought Fitzroy. “Are we\r\nnever to reach Australia, the land of all my hopes?”\r\n\r\n“I tell you what it is, Stransom,” he said one day to the skipper,\r\n“something has got to be done, else I shall go out of my mind.”\r\n\r\nAs the skipper made no reply--\r\n\r\n“I say,” he continued, “couldn’t something be done with the ship\r\nherself? Couldn’t we put to sea again and try to make some land,\r\nsomewhere? She seems trustworthy now.”\r\n\r\n“You are no sailor, Mr. Fitzroy. We are shorthanded, and the ship once\r\nstrained by a heavy sea would certainly sink. No; I myself think\r\nsomething should be done, else we’ll get as cowardly as rats in a hole.\r\nI’ll think it over and let you know. Are you ready to follow my advice?”\r\nhe added.\r\n\r\n“Yes!” cried Fitzroy and Johnnie both in one breath. And even Gourmie\r\nwakened up out of his lethargy and smiled a ten-inch smile. “I’m on for\r\nanything, from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter,” he cried, rubbing his\r\nhands; “and if it comes to a fair stand-up fight Gourmie’ll do two men’s\r\nshare at least.”\r\n\r\nThe giant rubbed his hands again. The skipper lit his pipe and threw\r\nhimself down on the deck to think. And Johnnie ran forward to see\r\nWillie.\r\n\r\n“Willie, Willie; don’t sit and mope there like a baby owl. Something is\r\ngoing to be done. Father and the captain said so. We’re going to get out\r\nof this hole by hook or by crook.”\r\n\r\n“Wowff--wow--ow--ow!” bayed Ralph, and Willie jumped joyfully up, and\r\nfive minutes afterwards he and Peggy and Johnnie were having a concert\r\ntogether in the saloon.\r\n\r\nEverybody had more appetite for dinner that day, and after it Stransom\r\nsaid, carelessly--\r\n\r\n“I’m going on shore to-night with Tootaker. Don’t worry if I don’t come\r\nback till sunrise.”\r\n\r\nJohnnie liked that speech, and couldn’t help admiring the captain for\r\nhis coolness.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t have made a better speech myself,” he told Willie, in\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nBut everyone wondered what was going to happen next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nOn the Cannibal Isle.\r\n\r\n\r\nStransom, the old blackbirder, was a go-ahead kind of fellow, and as\r\nbold as a lion. He was just the man who would “make a spoon or spoil a\r\nhorn”--“do a deed or perish in the attempt.” There was no fear of\r\nfailure in his heart.\r\n\r\nAbout a couple of hours before sunset he stuck his revolvers in his\r\nbelt, nodded to those he was leaving behind, and beckoned to Tootaker to\r\nfollow him into the canoe. A few minutes after this the white man and\r\nthe friendly savage stood together in a woodland glade.\r\n\r\n“I can trust Tootaker?”\r\n\r\n“Tootaker will die for master. Not false, true, true!”\r\n\r\nThis in the language of the islanders.\r\n\r\n“Lead me through the woods, Tootaker. I would speak with your chief.”\r\n\r\nThe guide darted forward. Stransom looked at his revolvers. He meant to\r\nshoot that guide through the head if he exhibited even a trace of\r\ntreachery or fear. The only thing to dread in this wood was the snakes.\r\nCreatures of marvellous beauty, small, slender, green or crimson, they\r\ncrept and twined everywhere. Among the reeds by pools, in the pools\r\nthemselves, and in the branches of the trees, Stransom had often to dash\r\nthem aside with his brown hands. Yet beautiful though they were, a\r\nsingle bite would mean an agonising death.\r\n\r\nThis jungle was a most intricate one. The trees did not grow from roots\r\nunderground: the roots were above, so that one had to climb over them,\r\nor creep under them. It was a swamp and a labyrinth combined, and if\r\nTootaker had wished to be unfaithful, he had a good chance now, even in\r\nspite of Stransom’s revolvers. But the white man had won his affection;\r\nand, above all, the wondrous beauty of the child Peggy had so stolen\r\naround his savage heart, that he had lost all desire to live longer\r\namong his own people.\r\n\r\nThe sun was almost down before they got clear of the forest. They were\r\non a bare green hill now, and far below on the east side of the island\r\nthey could see the waving cocoa-palms and the green banana banks near to\r\nwhich the savages dwelt.\r\n\r\n“Halt!” cried Stransom.\r\n\r\nThen he took out a long piece of rope and tied the guide’s arms to his\r\nside and his wrists to one another, bidding the wondering Tootaker watch\r\nexactly how it was done. Tootaker had cute eyes, and he needed them to\r\nfollow this wondrous intricacy of knot.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Stransom, laughing, “pull your hands apart.”\r\n\r\nTootaker did so, and to his amazement every knot was instantly loosed\r\nand the rope fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n“Now bind me, Tootaker.”\r\n\r\nThe black was a little awkward at first, but he soon managed the whole\r\ntrick.\r\n\r\nBy this time the moon had risen, and in less than half an hour Tootaker\r\nmarched with bold strides into the camp, and right up to the great kraal\r\nof the king, leading a white captive, apparently bound and helpless.\r\n\r\nThere were shouts of savage joy, but Tootaker held up his hand\r\nauthoritatively and commanded silence. The natives followed as far as\r\nthe verandah of the palace, but on being told that he and his captive\r\nmust first hold chik-chak with the chief, they retired.\r\n\r\nCritical moments followed. Stransom was staking his life and the life of\r\nall on board the _Vulture_ on one bold stroke. If it failed--well, after\r\nall, people have only once to die!\r\n\r\nBut Tootaker had been well instructed how to play his part, and forgot\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThe king was squatting on a daïs, from which he did not rise, but\r\nreceived Tootaker with great joy, and asked him question after question,\r\nwhile with bowed head Stransom stood before the throne. He smiled to\r\nhimself though, when he heard this cannibal king telling Tootaker how\r\nhis body was to be cut up, and what joints should be roasted for the\r\nroyal table, and what apportioned to his under-chiefs and people. The\r\nking evidently intended that all the most toothsome and appetising\r\nportions of Stransom’s body should fall to his own share.\r\n\r\n“Now,” cried the king, “bring him here that I may drink the white man’s\r\nblood.”\r\n\r\nHe seized an ugly knife as he spoke. But he certainly was not prepared\r\nfor what followed. With a sharp kick Stransom struck the knife from the\r\nsavage hand, and next moment he stood before him a free man armed with a\r\nrevolver in each hand. Stransom spoke hurriedly now, but with excellent\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n“One loud word, King Karoo, and you are a dead man.”\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met. The king cowered before his captive.\r\n\r\n“Ah, you know me now? I am Stransom the blackbirder. How you came here I\r\nknow not, but you were chief of the Luttoo Isles, five hundred miles to\r\nthe west, and you and your fellows massacred every man of the brig\r\n_Ranger_. Don’t be afraid, old friend. I was her captain, and the only\r\nman saved.”\r\n\r\n“I saved you!” cried the king, excitedly, as he glanced down the barrel\r\nof that revolver in evident dread that it might go off. “I saved you!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you thundering old scoundrel, you saved me, to be tortured and\r\nthus made more tender, and so to serve as a side dish for your own\r\ntable. But, listen! I did not come here to have revenge and kill you!\r\nYour people did nothing wrong in massacring the blackbirders. They had\r\ncome to drag you into bondage worse than slavery. I would have done the\r\nsame had I been in your place. No, I don’t come now to take revenge,\r\nelse I’d shoot you like a rabbit right off. I’m no longer a\r\nblackbirder.”\r\n\r\nThen in far simpler language he told the story of the storm, the mutiny,\r\nand the desertion of the ship, and the wreck.\r\n\r\n“The blackbirders will come to your island by and by, but if you now\r\nmake friends with the remainder of my people we will give you and your\r\nfellows and your women wonderful gifts and beautiful beads. See, here\r\nare some of them.”\r\n\r\nHe emptied his pockets as he spoke, of strings of beads that quite\r\ndazzled the savage king.\r\n\r\n“Oh-h-h!” he cried, “and you will give me all this?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if you will come with me to-night, at once, through the moonlight\r\nin your big canoe to the creek where lies our ship.”\r\n\r\n“And you will not kill me and eat me?”\r\n\r\n“Eat you, King Karoo! I’d be precious hungry before I touched a morsel\r\nof such a tough old rascal as you. Be true to me as Tootaker has been,\r\nand you and your island will be spared when the great ship comes. For I\r\ncan save you.”\r\n\r\n“You are a white devil?” asked the king.\r\n\r\n“Angel or devil, I’ll keep my word. Now, which do you choose, death or\r\nlife?”\r\n\r\nAnd Karoo bent his head in submission, only begging leave to take in his\r\nboat ten trusty warriors.\r\n\r\nStransom, by way of reply, coolly counted the number of chambers in his\r\nrevolvers, going round them with his finger-tips--“One life, two lives,\r\nthree lives,” etc., up to ten; then he nodded and smiled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNeither Fitzroy nor his boy were easy enough in their minds to-night to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nThe moon was at its height, when suddenly Ralph started up and bayed in\r\nanger. A huge war-canoe had swept round the point and was entering the\r\ncreek.\r\n\r\nThe big gun was directed at it immediately.\r\n\r\n“Who goes there? Speak quick, or I fire!”\r\n\r\n“All right, Fitz. It’s Stransom. Prepare to receive royalty.”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” shouted Gourmand, seizing his big bass instrument which had\r\nbeen made specially for him, and wound right round his shoulder like a\r\nHighlander’s plaid. The mouthpiece of it was so big that Willie could\r\nget inside easily. He blew a blast that would have awakened the dead.\r\n\r\nWhen with considerable difficulty, for he was very fat, the old king got\r\nup the side, and saw Gourmand, he started back and nearly went heels\r\nover head into the sea again.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be afraid, old boy,” said Stransom, hitting him a smack on the\r\nback that almost took his breath away. “That’s only one of my little\r\nboys.”\r\n\r\nThen Stransom gave Tootaker orders not to let anyone else up the side,\r\nfor savages are arrant thieves, and took the king below to the saloon.\r\nThe king’s eyes were now like bull’s eyes with amazement mingled with\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nBut Stransom made him sit down, and gave him a stiff glass of whisky.\r\nHand in hand with Willie, Peggy herself came in, all smiles. Stransom\r\nintroduced them.\r\n\r\n“Two babies,” he said, “just three days old.”\r\n\r\nJohnnie entered next.\r\n\r\n“Born four days ago,” said Stransom, coolly.\r\n\r\n“How do, old block? Delighted, I’m sure!”\r\n\r\nThe king took Johnnie’s extended hand, but holloed with pain immediately\r\nafter, for the athletic boy had given him what he called an artistic\r\nsqueeze. It was artistic enough, anyhow, to make the blood ooze from\r\nunder his nails. No wonder he holloed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Fitzroy entertained the men in the canoe. They ate like ogres\r\nof the good things handed down to them--a bushel of biscuits and about\r\nfifteen pounds of salt beef. Fitzroy could see them, their stomachs\r\nswelling even in the moonlight. Then he threw them down beads, and\r\ncoloured cloth.\r\n\r\nThey fought over this till they nearly capsized the great war-canoe. But\r\nthe fittest survived: the rest were _hors de combat_ between the\r\nthwarts.\r\n\r\nThe king had more whisky!\r\n\r\nHe grew happy and fought all his battles over again, and told of all the\r\nwondrous cannibal feasts he had taken part in. He even volunteered a\r\nsong, though he had no more music in him than a carrion crow.\r\n\r\nHe had some more whisky, and was then induced to go on deck, and walk\r\nforward, or rather totter, gibbering all the time like a blithering\r\nidiot. Here he lay down, and Fitzroy threw a tarpaulin over him.\r\n\r\nTootaker stood sentry over his king all night, and the savage emperor\r\nwas a different man in the morning, and a sadder.\r\n\r\nBut in this strange way was friendship established between the white men\r\nand this terrible tribe of cannibals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nA Bloodless Battle.--Life on the Island.\r\n\r\n\r\nA hearty breakfast--and it was a hearty one too--put King Karoo into\r\nfine form again. He was quite friendly now.\r\n\r\n“We don’t want to eat any more white men,” he said.\r\n\r\n“If you try it,” said Stransom, “you may find that the bones will stick\r\nin your throat.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Fitz,” he added, turning to the playwright and flute-maker, “I\r\nbelieve in striking the iron while it is still hot--I purpose going back\r\nwith the king. The canoe is big enough to hold us all. But you and\r\nJohnnie had better stay here to guard the ship, not that there is any\r\ndanger, but if I take Gourmand----”\r\n\r\n“I’m on again,” said Gourmie.\r\n\r\n“And Willie and Peggy, and give these savages a little entertainment and\r\na few presents, I think we shall win a bloodless battle. What say you?”\r\n\r\n“I’m a little afraid for Peggy,” replied Fitzroy; “she is the strength\r\nof the company; besides, we all love her, and----”\r\n\r\nBut Fitzroy’s scruples were soon overcome, and so, after dressing like\r\nan angel--this was Johnnie’s expression--Peggy was the first to get into\r\nthe war-canoe, much to the astonishment of the savages. Peggy had no\r\nfear. All were armed with revolvers. But there did not seem very much to\r\ndread. They took quite a bale of goods with them, and Gourmand had his\r\ngreat duck-gun: so big and heavy was it, that few ordinary men could\r\nhave wielded it.\r\n\r\nOn his way to the king’s camp, and while still at sea, Gourmand raised\r\nthe piece and brought down a bird of the hawk species. The report was so\r\nawful and so unexpected, that most of the crew fell backwards with\r\nalarm, and lay there with their naked legs in the air.\r\n\r\nThe king himself almost fainted, but when he saw the great bird lying\r\ndead on the water--\r\n\r\n“Oh, good, good!” he exclaimed, in his own language. “The big boy\r\nclever, clever. When we get back, the big boy shall shoot my old fat\r\nwife. She is good for nothing now--only for soup.”\r\n\r\nThe landing was very impressive. The savages crowded round their king,\r\nand it was evident from his gestures that he was telling all his\r\nadventures, and speaking in favour of these white men.\r\n\r\nWhen a few minutes after this the pigmy Willie led Peggy on shore, and\r\nPeggy smiled and bowed to them, and then quietly ran, chattering and\r\nlaughing, into the very midst of the wildest-looking group, those\r\ncannibals were completely vanquished.\r\n\r\nBut when Gourmand jumped on shore with his marvellous trombone, they\r\nfell back, and would have turned pale with superstitious terror, if it\r\nwere possible for a negro to do so. Then Gourmand blew a blast from the\r\ninstrument, and twenty men at least fell flat on their faces. But seeing\r\nthe king laughing, they took heart and advanced, and in less than five\r\nminutes the giant was so great a favourite that they would willingly\r\nhave killed and eaten Karoo in order that Gourmand might reign in his\r\nstead. And so this bloodless battle was won.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe child Peggy had brought her mandoline, and was invited by the king\r\nto sing, in order that his people, he said, might rejoice.\r\n\r\nPeggy needed no second bidding. She mounted a grassy mound beneath a\r\nspreading tree and sang her best and sweetest song. It did seem strange,\r\nthis crowd of listening, spear-armed savages, around the one little mite\r\nof a white child who had the power to enthral them with the music of her\r\nvoice!\r\n\r\nBut when, with Willie as a partner, she danced a fandango, the natives\r\ngrew wildly excited, and they too must dance. Before Peggy knew exactly\r\nwhat was the matter, behold, a triple ring of them were whirling madly\r\nround the tree, shouting, screaming, and yelling, while they brandished\r\ntheir spears aloft!\r\n\r\n“Give them a solo,” shouted Stransom to Gourmand; “it will help to\r\nquicken the beggars.”\r\n\r\nAnd at the very first blast from that marvellous instrument, a scene of\r\npanic ensued, such as is seldom witnessed. The savages darted back in\r\nall directions, knocking each other down, falling on each other, with\r\nlegs, arms, heads and spears, in such a mad comminglement, the wonder is\r\nthat many were not killed; and before Gourmand had finished his\r\ngigantic solo, there wasn’t a soul to be seen.\r\n\r\n“‘Music hath charms,’” cried Gourmand, doing an attitude, “‘to soothe\r\nthe savage breast.’”\r\n\r\nThe king almost went into a fit with laughing, while Peggy and Willie\r\njoined in the general merriment, and the giant added his bass “Ho! ho!\r\nho!” and his deep “Ha! ha! ha!” till the very welkin rang.\r\n\r\nBut the natives soon returned, and “Little Gourmie,” as Willie called\r\nhim, gave an exhibition of his strength and skill that astounded his\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nThe giant was then requested by the king to shoot his fat old wife.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Gourmie; “I’ve never been used to shooting fat old wives, and\r\nI’m too old to learn. Thank you, all the same.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPeggy and Willie had described all their picnic that evening at dinner\r\nto Johnnie, and Johnnie sighed because he hadn’t been there.\r\n\r\nThe friendship between the savages and the whites soon ripened into\r\nsomething very real and lasting.\r\n\r\nThe king gladly gave his people permission to build a fort for the\r\nWanderers, and they worked so hard under Stransom’s supervision that it\r\nwas soon completed. It was erected close to the wood, and was to all\r\nintents and purposes impregnable.\r\n\r\nIn boats, round from the creek, all provisions and everything of value\r\nwas brought. The _Vulture_, indeed, was now dismantled, for she had\r\nbegun to leak again.\r\n\r\nAbout a month after our heroes had settled down in their strange wild\r\nhome, a cyclone swept over the island; so terrible was its force, that\r\ntrees were torn up by the roots and carried high into the air. The sea\r\nrose and threatened to sap the very foundations of the fort, and\r\nhundreds of the native huts were scattered about like so much hay.\r\n\r\nNext day all was calm again, and the savages quietly commenced to\r\nrebuild their huts. But the _Vulture_ had sunk at her moorings. Well was\r\nit for our people that they had left her in time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLong months passed with no signs of deliverance from this beautiful\r\nisland-life, which was, after all, but exile; and Fitzroy and Stransom\r\nwere now the greatest of friends with the savages, and really nothing\r\nelse save friendship and love ruled the place.\r\n\r\nYes, they were cannibals, but what one eats is merely a matter of taste,\r\nand I have known many respectable cannibals, though I never accepted the\r\ninvitations to dinner they sent me. Her majesty the fat queen had\r\nsomehow disappeared.\r\n\r\n“Haven’t seen her majesty of late,” said Stransom, one day, to the king.\r\n\r\n“What!” was the reply. “You are sorry, then, I did not send you a\r\njoint?”\r\n\r\nThat was the answer put into English. It was really a much more gruesome\r\none. “It was a shuddery reply,” Johnnie said.\r\n\r\nThe lives of Johnnie, Willie, and Peggy (with noble Ralph, of course)\r\nwere nearly all woodland and wave now. They had canoes, one each, in\r\nwhich they rowed races, or from which they fished, whenever it was fine,\r\nand around this enchanting island, cannibalistic though it was, the seas\r\nwere nearly always smooth and blue.\r\n\r\nThey all carried revolvers wherever they went, not that there was much\r\ndanger, but one should always be prepared. “Peggy was an excellent\r\nshot,” so said Willie; “because,” he added, “she always manages to hit\r\nthe thing she isn’t aiming at.” By the way, the cannibals made a canoe\r\nfor this dear little dwarf boy, and it wasn’t much bigger than a pocket\r\ndictionary--well, it might have been a little larger. It is best to be\r\nexact in matters of this sort.\r\n\r\nThe king dearly loved to have Peggy and the dwarf to play and sing to\r\nhim, and usually went to sleep during the performance. This was very\r\n“sweet” of him, Peggy said, and “quite complimentary.”\r\n\r\nPeggy’s influence over this cannibal king was very great. She twined him\r\nround her little finger, so to speak. He had to do everything the pretty\r\nlittle minx told him, and take her and her companions out in the royal\r\ncanoe whenever she wanted a picnic or an airing. The king would sit\r\npatiently on his daïs sometimes, as calm and serene as a summer sunset\r\nor a stucco cat, while she dressed him from top to toe in flowers and\r\nleaves and strings of beads, and finally crowned him with her oldest\r\ntartan Tam o’ Shanter. He looked so droll in this get-up that Peggy had\r\nto clap her hands and laugh and run round and round about him, to view\r\nhim from every quarter. If there had been a missionary on the island and\r\nPeggy had asked the king to throw a stone at him, the king would have\r\nobeyed, unhesitatingly.\r\n\r\nThere had been a missionary there once, the king allowed. The missionary\r\nsaid Providence had sent him. The king believed him, for that\r\nmissionary, his majesty told Johnnie, made the best curry ever he had\r\ntasted!\r\n\r\n“The missionary was a good cook, then?” said Johnnie.\r\n\r\n“Good cook!” cried the king. “No, no, my fat old wife the cook. My wife\r\ncookee _he_!”\r\n\r\nThe king was being taught English, but it wasn’t the best.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I see,” said Johnnie, “I see now. Your wife cookee _he_, and you\r\ncookee _she_. Well, you’re a queer lot, you cannibal fellows.”\r\n\r\nAt first Ralph the blood-hound used to terrorise the whole population,\r\nspecially the little pickaninnies or children, who all ran from him when\r\nhe appeared on the white sandy beach where they played.\r\n\r\nIt made our young heroes laugh till their sides were sore to see a crowd\r\nof these naked little black children fleeing from Ralph, who, by the\r\nway, never condescended to chase them. It was a crowd of whirling legs\r\nand arms, and each tiny cannibal looked like the three-legged wheel you\r\nsee on a Manx half-penny, only without stockings or bootlets on.\r\n\r\nThe king delighted to see the giant exhibit his strength. But when one\r\nday the tiny dwarf boy, unknown to the king, hid inside the bell-shaped\r\nend of Gourmand’s enormous brass basoon and jumped out with a wild\r\nshriek when the giant began to play, his majesty nearly went into a fit\r\nwith laughing.\r\n\r\nIt _was_ fun! And some fresh fun was invented every day for the purpose\r\nof making this great big baby of a king laugh and shake.\r\n\r\nAh! well, but after all, our shipwrecked Wandering Minstrels did long\r\nfor home often enough too, and at supper-time or after, while by\r\nthemselves in the fort, they were never tired of talking about their\r\nadventures in dear old England--in wayside camp and caravan.\r\n\r\nOne morning early, Johnnie, who had been out shooting rock-rabbits, came\r\nback into the fort with a rush or a run.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” he cried; “the ship! the ship!”\r\n\r\nThen indeed there was excitement in the little fort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nWhite Wings upon the Waves.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere she was, just rounding the point--the bonnie, white-winged\r\nbarque--and standing in for the beach near to which the natives dwelt.\r\n\r\n“That’s a blackbirder,” said Stransom, “as sure as I’m a sailor. But we\r\nshall stop her game, shan’t we, Fitzroy?”\r\n\r\nThere was no time to lose.\r\n\r\nThe savages had already assembled on the beach to give the enemy a warm\r\nwelcome, and Stransom sent a black fellow off at once to the king,\r\nbidding him be of good cheer, because Fitzroy and Gourmand would be with\r\nthem round his own kraal without a moment’s delay.\r\n\r\nThis was done, but the blackbirders had the cruelty to fire a volley at\r\nthe retreating cannibals, killing and wounding several. The men from the\r\nfort now hurried up, making a slight detour through the bush in order to\r\nkeep out of sight. Gourmand carried the swivel gun. Fitzroy and the\r\nother two, rifles and the ammunition. There was a battery in front of\r\nthe native village, and behind this they quickly hid.\r\n\r\nThe blackbirders landed in three well-armed boats, and forthwith\r\ncommenced the attack, stopping every now and then to fire a volley at\r\nthe trenches. This was harmless enough, and Stransom would not permit\r\nthe savages to show themselves, although they were now burning for\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nProbably the blackbirders--a more cutthroat-looking crew it would have\r\nbeen impossible to conceive--suspected an ambuscade, for they now\r\nadvanced somewhat more slowly.\r\n\r\nAgain they fired.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately the trenches replied--a regular peppering volley that\r\nboth astonished and staggered these accursed slave-hunters.\r\n\r\n“Back to your boats, you villains,” shouted Stransom, “or we’ll blow you\r\nto Jericho.”\r\n\r\nA volley was all the reply, and on came the blackbirders with a rush.\r\nThey thought to carry the trench by storm.\r\n\r\nThe swivel gun was emptied into their very midst, and the slaughter was\r\nterrible: what had been a crowd of living men seemed now but a mangled\r\nmass of dead and dying. For even those unwounded threw themselves down\r\nand shouted for mercy.\r\n\r\nIt needed all the skill of the cannibal king to prevent his men from\r\nutterly wiping out the enemy. They were restrained, however, after a\r\nfashion, yet nearly all the wounded were speared.\r\n\r\nStransom and his men gathered round the rest and made them prisoners.\r\n\r\nAs the fight took place well out of sight of the few men left in charge\r\nof the barque, these had no idea what had occurred.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the raid was the captain of the ship himself. He was\r\nwounded, but had sufficient strength to sit up, and his eyes met those\r\nof Stransom. The man was Allison, first mate of the old _Vulture_.\r\n\r\n“Allison, it is you!”\r\n\r\n“It’s me, skipper. I deserve my fate. Let me now die in peace.”\r\n\r\n“Die in peace, you shall,” answered Stransom, “but, my good fellow, had\r\nyou not been wounded I should have hanged you!”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” sneered Allison.\r\n\r\nFitzroy now advanced. The playwright had some knowledge of surgery, and\r\nat once applied a tourniquet to the mutineer’s bleeding limb, and\r\ndressed it as well as he could.\r\n\r\nThe man was very faint, and begged for water. A negro lad climbed a\r\ncocoa-nut tree and threw down some of the greenest fruit.\r\n\r\nAfter Allison had drunk, he appeared to fall asleep, and Fitzroy got the\r\ngiant to carry him gently in under the shadow of the banana shrubs.\r\n\r\nPresently he opened his eyes. Fitzroy was kneeling by his side.\r\n\r\n“Don’t leave me,” he moaned. “Don’t let me die just yet. I have that on\r\nmy mind I would fain confess--and it concerns yourself--and Peggy\r\nMcQueen.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Stransom, with Johnnie and the giant, had gone off in one of\r\nthe boats, towards the barque. They had the swivel gun in the bow.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were near enough they hailed, “Ship ahoy!”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay. What’s in the wind?” cried a black-bearded, cut-throat-looking\r\nman over the stern.\r\n\r\n“You’ve got to surrender, that’s all, my sweet little seraph. Your\r\ngame’s up. Surrender quietly and your innocent life will be spared. If\r\nyou make a bit of bobbery, I’ll hang you from your own jibboom.”\r\n\r\n“We surrender.”\r\n\r\n“Does you now? Well, that is really very thoughtful of you. Been a\r\nblackbirder myself, though, darling. So just fire your guns in the air\r\nto please me, and to show us all is safe.”\r\n\r\n“Curse you!” cried the ruffian.\r\n\r\nThe rifles rang out, and immediately after were flung on the deck.\r\n\r\nNext minute, Stransom and Johnnie stood on the blackbirder’s poop.\r\n\r\n“Good-morning,” said the former, with provoking coolness. “Sulky was he?\r\nEh? Ah, but his mother’s darling mustn’t. Your new captain, that’s me,\r\ndoesn’t like sulky boys. Ah! he smiles! See this little thing? Look,\r\nthis is a revolver. His new captain doesn’t want to shoot, but must now\r\nsend all hands below, prisoners--four of you? Eh? All right, down all of\r\nyou to the hold. And when your new captain comes back he’ll let you all\r\nfree and not hang anybody if everybody will be good and do as he is\r\ntold.”\r\n\r\nIn five minutes more all four blackbirders were under lock and key.\r\n\r\n“She’s safe enough,” said Stransom, as they pulled back shorewards.\r\n“They can’t weigh anchor and give us the slip.”\r\n\r\n\r\nALLISON’S STRANGE STORY.\r\n\r\nFitzroy poured a little brandy from his flask into the man’s mouth. He\r\nswallowed it, and presently he felt strong enough to raise himself\r\nslightly and to sit supported in the arms of a native.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Fitzroy,” he said, “you must bear with me, and you must forgive me\r\nfor what I have done. Can you? Do you?”\r\n\r\n“I do,” said Fitzroy, solemnly, “as I hope to be forgiven when as close\r\nto the shadow of the grave as you are now.”\r\n\r\n“You remember, sir, when Peggy McQueen first came into your charge?”\r\n\r\n“I remember when I first adopted the dear child.”\r\n\r\n“You were paid to do so. The money you received helped to set you up in\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“If there has been any setting up in it,” answered Fitzroy.\r\n\r\n“You have been successful ever since.”\r\n\r\n“Till now, yes, fairly so.”\r\n\r\n“And you knew, Peggy had a history which you did not trouble your head\r\nmuch to inquire into?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, perhaps; but come, what has this to do with your confession?”\r\n\r\nThe man had fainted, but was soon restored, and went on again.\r\n\r\nHe was weaker now, however, and again Fitzroy held a little more brandy\r\nto his lips.\r\n\r\n“In my pocket--feel,” he said, slowly, “a key.” The left jacket pocket.\r\nYes, that is it. When you go on board, open my private drawer, and you\r\nwill find letters to testify to the truth of all I tell you. Peggy\r\nMcQueen is a stolen child--stolen that she might not reap the benefits\r\nof an uncle’s will. This uncle was an old bachelor and lived with his\r\nsister-in-law--yes, the address is in my drawer--the estate, it is a\r\nfine one, would be his only brother’s had he died without a will. His\r\nonly brother was his greatest enemy. He loved the child, and left her\r\nall his fortune. But the very night on which he died this evil brother\r\ncame to me. I was poor, and fell an easy prey to bribery.\r\n\r\n“Oh, horrible!” continued the dying man. “I was told off to steal Peggy\r\nand throw her down a disused well.”\r\n\r\nA light began to dawn on Fitzroy’s mind now, for he remembered the story\r\npoor Peggy had told him about her meeting with the beautiful,\r\nwhite-haired lady in her own park, and about everything that happened.\r\n\r\nHe grasped Allison by the cold hand.\r\n\r\n“And you--you murdered another child and threw _her_ into the well--you\r\nstole Peggy and--sold her to me!”\r\n\r\n“No--no--there was no murder. I could not do that, but--God forgive me,\r\nI robbed a grave of its little girl inmate. It was a ghoulish thing to\r\ndo. It was her corpse in Peggy’s clothes that was found down the well.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but----”\r\n\r\n“Listen, for I feel I am going fast. When the money I received for\r\nthe--the deed--was squandered--I blackmailed the evil brother! He\r\nlaughed at me first, but when I told him that Peggy was still alive, and\r\nthreatened to bring her up, he trembled like the coward he was, but\r\npromised that if I brought the child to him--but I would not--I was\r\nbribed again--but my men failed to kidnap her. Then came the plot to get\r\nyou and her out of the country to a place where she would never likely\r\nbe heard of again.”\r\n\r\n“Hold a moment! There was no Macgilvray?”\r\n\r\n“No--no--it was all a plot to ruin you--forgive--I--I----”\r\n\r\nIt was no faint this time. The brandy Fitzroy tried to pour into his\r\nmouth ran out again over his cheeks and chin.\r\n\r\nOnly one brief spasm, and the jaw dropped. The eyes were fixed for ever.\r\n\r\nFitzroy lowered him slowly to the ground and left the place, sad, though\r\nhe did not know why, and wondering if all this could be true.\r\n\r\nBut he had the key, and before nightfall he would know everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nShe Sailed Away in the Middle Watch.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo complete was the rout of the blackbirders, and so terrible a tale\r\nwould the survivors have to tell when they returned to Australian\r\nwaters, that many a long year, no doubt, would elapse before that\r\nblood-stained though beautiful island would be visited again.\r\n\r\nI fear that a great carnival commenced on this very night, and that it\r\nlasted for days. Our people were glad to be out of it, and they had much\r\nto do. But as many of the bodies as could be recovered were taken out,\r\nby Stransom’s orders, and buried at sea. The cannibals might do what\r\nthey pleased with their own dead. They would no doubt afford them decent\r\ninterment after their own fashion.\r\n\r\nThe cannibals did, but over their orgies we must draw a curtain.\r\n\r\nOnly five of the blackbirders had escaped intact, and to these Stransom\r\noffered life and liberty if they would help to work the ship to the\r\nnearest British port.\r\n\r\nThey were only too glad to do so. As far as regards their share of\r\nblackbirding, they could hardly be called free agents. Allison himself\r\nwas the only man who could have been brought to account. And he was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nStransom and Fitzroy spent the next few weeks in determining the\r\nlatitude and longitude, and studying the topography of the island,\r\ntaking soundings, and surveying generally.\r\n\r\nVery pleasant indeed were these little picnics, as the young people\r\ncalled them. They were made in the barque’s own boats. Stransom was an\r\nold sailor, and knew well the tricks and manners of the blackbirders. He\r\nknew that they would not hesitate to get up anchor and sail away with\r\nthe ship if he gave them but half a chance. But he kept his weather eye\r\nlifting, and while cruising round the island he only left one hand on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nIs it strange that Peggy felt really sorry when the time drew near when\r\nshe would have to part for ever with the cannibal king? But she really\r\nwas so.\r\n\r\nThis curious being, however, was offered his passage to England, if he\r\nchose to accept it.\r\n\r\n“No,” he replied, in his broken English; “no goodee fo’ me. Plap\r\nEenglan’ moochee too small place! Den ebery man haf on’y one wife. King\r\nKaroo stop ’long his people. When King Karoo too old, his people knockee\r\non de head and truly bury him, plenty.”\r\n\r\n“Bury him in the usual way, I suppose,” said Fitzroy, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Plaps,” said the king, laconically.\r\n\r\nFeeling perfectly safe now, the girl with Johnnie and their friend the\r\ndog made many excursions into the far interior of this beautiful island.\r\n\r\nThere were hills here of rare beauty, green wooded, almost to their\r\nsummits, between which glimpses could be caught on every side of a sea\r\nmore blue and lovely than any other in all this wide world--a sea in\r\nwhich many a little island was afloat apparently ’twixt ocean and sky,\r\nislands with white and silvery sands along the beach, but bedecked with\r\nmany a waving tree-fern and feathery palm, among which fairies and elves\r\nmust play in the starlight if any such there be in this world of ours.\r\n\r\nNo doubt those seas are wild and stormy enough at certain times and\r\nseasons. Indeed I myself have found them so, but placid and peaceful\r\nenough were they all the time our heroes were there.\r\n\r\nThe birds were numerous enough and beautiful, yet all but songless.\r\nEverywhere the flowers were gorgeous. And butterflies as large as fans,\r\nbut far more radiant in their rainbow beauty, flitted from bush to bush\r\nrevelling in the warm sunshine.\r\n\r\nBeing somewhat of a naturalist, Johnnie determined to make a collection\r\nof these. It is a delightful fancy, this of butterfly hunting, for\r\nalthough it is against my own principles to take life, or deprive a\r\nsummer’s day of anything that is beautiful, still these creatures are\r\nnumerous enough, and hardly suffer pain when caught and killed by\r\npinching the thorax, or with chloroform.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, with their nets, Peggy and Johnnie, sometimes Willie being with\r\nthem, and always Ralph, spent many a happy hour.\r\n\r\nBut one day they wandered farther a-field than usual, and presently\r\nfound themselves nearing a wood, where the trees were higher than any\r\nthey had yet seen, and where there was but little undergrowth, the stems\r\nrising tall and pillar-like straight into the air, and mingling their\r\npalm-like leaves to form a canopy of green.\r\n\r\nHad they taken the faithful hound’s advice they would have turned back\r\nat once, for he stopped at the entrance of the forest, and sniffed the\r\nair suspiciously, and it was with something like terror in his eyes, and\r\nwith evident reluctance, that he followed his little master and mistress\r\ninto the gloomy depths.\r\n\r\nNor was it long before the two became conscious of a sickly, death-like\r\nodour that went straight round their hearts.\r\n\r\nThen all at once they found themselves in one of the most awful places\r\nthat pen can describe, a temple built of human bones. They felt a kind\r\nof terrible fascination steal over them as they gazed with fear and\r\nterror at the walls around them.\r\n\r\nGhastly designs with long bones and spines and ribs, a fearful species\r\nof rude architecture; the walls of the avenue that led to the oval\r\ninterior, the walls of the temple itself, and even a raised platform--no\r\nneed to say for what dread purpose this had been built--all were built\r\nof human bones. Climbing wild flowers trailed here and there over the\r\nwalls, little lizards crept in and out of eyeless sockets, and\r\nbright-winged birds perched innocently on rain-bleached skulls!\r\n\r\nNo wonder Peggy clutched Johnnie’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Oh, lead me on, lead me out of this,” she cried.\r\n\r\nIt was a sight she would never forget, a sight she would dream of many a\r\nnight in after life when on a bed of sickness. Ugh!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat very night Peggy McQueen formed a resolution. Some may call it a\r\nchildish one. Perhaps it was, yet even from the mouths of babes and\r\nsucklings wisdom at times may come.\r\n\r\nShe would try to convert that blood-stained cannibal king.\r\n\r\nShe now spent an hour or two each day with him at his palace of huts,\r\nand surely no preacher ever expounded the doctrines of Christianity in\r\nlanguage more simple and beautiful, yet forcible, than did our little\r\nheroine. Its loveliness, its truths, and its terrors, she told him all.\r\n\r\nDid she succeed? Ah, that I cannot tell, but the king’s soul, it must be\r\nremembered, was like that of a little child. The souls of all savages\r\nare, and if the guileless prattle of child Peggy did not appeal to it\r\nand touch a chord, the sterner, though more learned logic of no\r\nmissionary may hope to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe Wandering Minstrels gave one more performance the night before they\r\nleft, and every one of Fitzroy’s troupe excelled himself and broke all\r\nformer record.\r\n\r\nJohnnie never felt in better form; Willie had never been so funny\r\nbefore; Peggy never sang nor played more sweetly; the giant’s great\r\nbrass bassoon made echoes ring from tree to tree; then good-byes were\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\nFireflies were flitting from bush to bush, and moon and stars shone\r\nsoftly on the sea when the boats took all hands back to the barque.\r\n\r\nWhen poor King Karoo looked seaward at sunrise next morning, never a\r\nsign of ship was there, nor on the distant horizon.\r\n\r\nShe had sailed away in the middle watch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe owners of the blackbirding barque, which had been so cleverly\r\ncaptured off the cannibal island, served their own interests, I think,\r\nby denying all knowledge of her, when written to on the subject. She was\r\na splendid clipper, and must have cost a deal to build. But she now\r\nbecame the property of her captors, and when paid off in Southampton\r\nwaters, the black-bearded mate and his men were very glad to get off\r\nscot-free. They had not expected such leniency.\r\n\r\nThe vessel herself was sold at a good figure, and Stransom had his\r\nshare, which was a good and a solid one. He disappears from our story,\r\nand so, too, does the barque.\r\n\r\nFitzroy and his people had their shares also, and Johnnie’s father was\r\nnow able to set up as a music publisher in London.\r\n\r\nHe is there now, in winter that is. If you want to know where he is in\r\nsummer, reader, you must read on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Annandale was sitting in his easy-chair one summer evening, when his\r\nservant entered with a silver salver in his hand, on which lay a card\r\nwith the simple inscription--\r\n\r\n                          “REGINALD FITZROY.”\r\n\r\n“Show him in, James.”\r\n\r\nNext minute Fitzroy himself and Peggy, now a beautiful, ladylike girl of\r\nthirteen, entered.\r\n\r\nThe white-haired old physician rose, and bowing, prayed them to be\r\nseated.\r\n\r\n“Is this to be my little patient?” he said. “She does not look ill.”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Fitzroy; “she is not ill, but we have a strange story to\r\ntell, which will interest you; at least I believe so.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor touched the bell.\r\n\r\n“James,” he said, when the man re-entered, “I am not to be disturbed\r\nuntil I ring. Let callers wait. Now, Mr. Fitzroy, I am at your service.”\r\n\r\n“You have been physician, I believe, for many years to Mrs. Wycliffe of\r\nWycliffe Park here, in your neighbourhood?”\r\n\r\nThe doctor folded his thin white hands and leaned back complacently in\r\nhis chair.\r\n\r\n“For over twenty years,” he said.\r\n\r\n“It is of her we would speak, doctor. And I must be brief. She had one\r\nchild, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Alas! yes, a dear, sweet little girl, who disappeared mysteriously, and\r\nwas found many weeks afterwards at the bottom of a well.”\r\n\r\n“Did--did you make a post-mortem, doctor?”\r\n\r\n“I did.”\r\n\r\n“Was there any evidence of foul-play?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing that we could hinge a case upon. The poor little tot had\r\nwandered away and fallen into this terrible place. So we believe, at\r\nleast.”\r\n\r\n“Was there any birth-mark?”\r\n\r\n“There was, or rather, had been before death, a curiously-shaped mark on\r\nthe right arm above the elbow.”\r\n\r\n“Did you find this mark on the little body which had fallen into or been\r\nthrown into a pit?”\r\n\r\n“The body, sir, had lain too long to distinguish this. The\r\nidentification was simple. The clothes and even trinkets were those the\r\nchild had worn on the very morning of her disappearance.”\r\n\r\n“Doctor, look at my adopted child here. Can you say that you have never\r\nclapped eyes on her before?”\r\n\r\nThe physician scrutinised Peggy for a short time.\r\n\r\n“The same hair and eyes,” he said, slowly.\r\n\r\n“Was the child found in the well auburn-haired?” asked Fitzroy.\r\n\r\n“Ye--es, or brown-auburn, I _think_.”\r\n\r\n“Bare your right arm, Peggy.”\r\n\r\nThe child did so, and the doctor started as if he had seen a ghost.\r\n\r\n“Why--God have mercy on us, Mr. Fitzroy, this is Maggie Wycliffe back\r\nfrom the grave!”\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Fitzroy, “will you listen patiently to my story and hers?”\r\n\r\nAnd he told the doctor all.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, after hearing it, took several strides up and down the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n“We must be cautious,” he said at last, “how we break the news to--to\r\nMaggie’s mother. A shock might kill her. Even a shock of joy.”\r\n\r\n“All this I leave to you, my dear sir. But you are convinced yourself\r\nnow, that here stands Maggie Wycliffe, and convinced, too, of the\r\nterrible wrong that has been done her.”\r\n\r\n“I see it all very, very clearly now.”\r\n\r\n“Then I have nothing further to say at present, doctor, and shall take\r\nmy leave. I have my part to play; you have yours. Good-night, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Good-night, Mr. Fitzroy. Good-night, little Maggie.”\r\n\r\nThe meeting between Peggy, for I must continue to call her by this sweet\r\nname, and her mother, the gentle-faced old lady with the snow-white\r\nhair, whom the child had met in the park, was a very tender one.\r\n\r\nThere were tears in Mrs. Wycliffe’s eyes as she pressed the child to her\r\nheart, and tears in Peggy’s too.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to live for your sake. I am going to try to make you happy,\r\nchild.”\r\n\r\n“And I will make you happy, mother.”\r\n\r\nThe word “mother” was a new one to Peggy, but it seemed a very, very\r\nfond one.\r\n\r\nFitzroy was so pleased when asked to take up his residence at the Park\r\ntill things were settled. He lost no time about this settlement,\r\nnotwithstanding, but placed the matter at once in his lawyer’s hands.\r\n\r\nThere was like to be some little trouble at first. The evil brother had\r\nheld the estates of Creve for eight long years now, and he felt it hard\r\nto give them up. But so terrible was the evidence of his guilt that even\r\nhis own solicitor advised him not to fight the case.\r\n\r\nOn the very next day after this advice had been vouchsafed, the unhappy\r\nman was found dead in his bed. It matters but little now what the\r\nverdict of the coroner was. He is gone, and we must hope that he is\r\nforgiven.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe estates of Creve in Devonshire, under the guardianship of her\r\nmother, are worth many thousands annually, and Peggy Wycliffe is the\r\nbeautiful little mistress thereof, but somehow neither she nor her\r\nmother care to reside there, and so they are let.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy story is told--my “ower true” tale. And so the curtain drops.\r\n\r\nYet it seems but right that we should raise it again for a few moments\r\nto have one last look at our heroes and heroines.\r\n\r\nLittle Peggy McQueen or Wycliffe is very happy in her new home, and her\r\nmother is really renewing her youth. Sad it is that she is almost blind.\r\nShe and her daughter are never parted. They may often be seen walking\r\ntogether in the beautiful park when the weather is fine, and always\r\nfollowed by that noble blood-hound, Ralph.\r\n\r\nAnd there is one seat among the trees on which they very often rest. It\r\nis the rustic daïs on which Peggy was sitting with her dog that day,\r\nwhen quietly up behind her came the gentle lady with the snow-white\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nWillie Randolph, Peggy’s old favourite, she is going to see frequently,\r\nalso poor little Gourmie.\r\n\r\nAs for Molly. Oh, bless my soul, my dear young reader, I wouldn’t forget\r\nher for the world. She is a resident at Wycliffe now, and looks after\r\nthe plate and the linen, and is just as happy as the twenty-first of\r\nJune is long.\r\n\r\nMolly says she is getting old. “_Getting_” you know, and Peggy smiles\r\nkindly on her when she says so. “And my poor back, Miss Peggy,” she\r\nsays, “it do ache unkimmon sometimes, with that plaguey rheumatiz. But\r\nwhat can I expect, dear Missie. I be’s six-and-forty years o’ age. Ay,\r\nbe I.”\r\n\r\nI think myself that if Molly had said sixty-four instead of forty-six\r\nshe would have been nearer the mark. The same figures, four and six, but\r\nthe dear old lady had put the cart before the horse.\r\n\r\nWhat matters it? Old Molly is happy.\r\n\r\nBoth Fitzroy and Johnnie are frequently down at Wycliffe enjoying a few\r\ndays’ sport, for game abounds on the estate.\r\n\r\nAnd right happy days these are. Johnnie is going into the Army. I am\r\ncurious to know what sort of a soldier he will make. I shall keep my\r\nweather eye lifting, but I feel sure that if Johnnie doesn’t win the\r\nVictoria Cross it will be through no fault of Johnnie’s.\r\n\r\nBut the dear old life in wayside camp and caravan is not going to be\r\naltogether given up. No, because with her mother’s sanction Peggy is\r\npreparing for a grand tour right away from the beautiful New Forest in\r\nHampshire to the wild grandeur of the Sutherland Highlands, far beyond\r\nthe Caledonian Alps. Peggy’s caravan will be no longer the little one\r\nover the half-door of which she was leaning when we first made her\r\nacquaintance. It is to be the most spacious and the handsomest\r\ntravelling car on the road, saloon-cabin and after-cabin. But Peggy’s\r\nmother will go also, and old Molly and Ralph as well.\r\n\r\nPeggy has told me that she does not mean to do things by halves, and\r\nthat not only shall Gourmie be one of the crew, but little Willie the\r\nviolinist, and Fitzroy himself.\r\n\r\nWill Johnnie be there? Was that what you asked? What a question, to be\r\nsure! If you asked Peggy herself, she would look at you in sweet\r\nsurprise and say, “Why, of course. Caravan life would not be caravan\r\nlife, nor a camp a camp, without Johnnie!”\r\n\r\nI end by wishing them a happy cruise.\r\n\r\nAnd you, my young reader, boy or girl, a happy Christmas, with a right\r\nmerry and jolly New Year to follow!\r\n\r\nTa, ta!\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON AND GLASGOW, COLLINS’ CLEAR-TYPE PRESS\r\n\r\nThe “Forward” Series.\r\n\r\nThe Original Series, with Coloured Pictures.\r\nNew Attractive Bindings, in Art Colours.\r\n\r\nThis Series of Books for Boys and Girls has been Edited by Herbert\r\nHayens, author of “Under the Lone Star” and numerous other Books for\r\nBoys; and care has been taken to publish only what can be confidently\r\nplaced in the hands of youth.\r\n\r\nEach Book is printed from a new font of Clear Type.\r\n\r\n\r\n  54 Stepping Heavenward.
