This is wrong. The fact is that the sphere of the\r\nprospector does not cover that of the engineer. The work of the one\r\nends where that of the other begins, and many of the most successful\r\ndiscoverers of metallic wealth have been entirely ignorant of the\r\nmethods by which a great mine should be opened, developed, and worked.\r\n\r\nA few simple tools and a not very deep knowledge of assaying, with an\r\nobservant eye and a brain quick to deduce inferences from what that\r\neye has seen, are the most valuable assets of a prospector. In time he\r\nwill gain experience, and experience will teach him much that he could\r\nnot learn in any college nor from any book. Each mining district\r\ndiffers from every other, and it has been found that certain rules\r\nwhich hold good in one region, and guide the seeker after wealth to\r\nthe hidden treasure that has been stored up for eons of time, do not\r\napply in another region.\r\n\r\nTo show what may be done with imperfect, improvised apparatus, an\r\nAustralian assayer, who has since become famous, started up country in\r\nhis youth with the following meager outfit: A cheap pair of scales, a\r\npiece of cheese cloth, a tin ring 1-1/2 inches by 1/2 inch, a small\r\nbrass door-knob, some powdered borax, some carbonate of soda and\r\nargol, a few pounds of lead lining taken from a tea chest, an empty\r\njam pot, a short steel drill, a red flower pot. With this modest\r\ncollection of implements he made forty assays of gold ores that turned\r\nout to be correct when repeated in a laboratory.\r\n\r\nAbout the best advice that can be given to a man who has determined to\r\ngo to some out of the way region where there is a possibility of his\r\ndiscovering minerals is to recommend him to visit the nearest museum\r\nand gain an acquaintance with the common rocks. Should he be unable to\r\ndo this he had better provide himself with small, inexpensive\r\nspecimens from the shop of some dealer. It is almost impossible to\r\nteach a beginner to distinguish the various rocks by any amount of\r\nprinted instruction; the only way to learn to recognize them is to\r\nhandle them and note carefully their color, weight, and the minerals\r\nthat go to make them up. The explorer should be able to recognize at a\r\nglance, or at any rate after a very short inspection, the sedimentary\r\nrocks, such as sandstone and limestone; the metamorphic rocks, that\r\nis, rocks that have been altered by the agency of great subterranean\r\nheat in ages long past, and which were probably stratified rocks at\r\none period, such as granite and gneiss, and the truly igneous\r\nrocks--trap, diabase, diorite, etc. He must know also that mysterious\r\nrock which the western miner calls porphyry, and to which is ascribed\r\nmost wonderful virtues in the way of ore attraction; while dolerite\r\nand dolomite must be to him familiar terms and substances. This sounds\r\neasy enough but the student will find that a good deal of hard work is\r\nnecessary before he can readily recognize each of these rocks.\r\n\r\nIt is even more necessary that he should learn the metals thoroughly.\r\nEach one differs from all the rest in some particular. Often this\r\ndifference will be an obscure one, but to the careful investigator the\r\nrecognition of the substance will be in the end certain. They may\r\ndiffer in weight, in color, in hardness, in a dozen different ways, so\r\nthat to the man who has made a study of this subject a determination\r\nis always possible.\r\n\r\nOn account of the wonderful discoveries in the Canadian Northwest and\r\nin Alaska, the eyes of thousands are turned towards those fields.\r\nWonderfully rich placer ground has already been found and there can be\r\nno reason to doubt that very much larger areas remain unproved. Where\r\nthis gold comes from is an open question; geologists, mineralogists\r\nand chemists, not to mention mining engineers and practical\r\nprospectors, have disputed over the source of the gold already found,\r\nbut it must be confessed that there are almost as many theories as\r\nthere are disputants. Could it be known with certainty how and under\r\nwhat conditions the gold got where it is found, the problem of seeking\r\nfor it might be made easier. Unfortunately this is not the case, and\r\nall prospecting for the home of the precious metal is more or less a\r\ngroping in the dark. We do know that the heaviest particles of gold do\r\nnot travel far from where they were first deposited, because gold is\r\nso enormously heavy--its specific gravity being about nineteen times\r\nthat of water--it seeks the bottom of the stream and stays there. It\r\nis not an invariable rule that the gold increases in coarseness as the\r\nstream is ascended, but it is a very general one. On some rivers rich\r\nand poor stretches of gold-bearing gravel succeed one another as the\r\nexplorer makes his way up or down stream. This is difficult to account\r\nfor, but in many cases is believed to be caused by the modern river\r\nrobbing the bed of some one or more ancient water-courses whose beds\r\ncrossed the valley of the present stream. This may or may not be the\r\ncase. We only know that the miners who found coarse gold on the lower\r\nregions of such rivers as the Frazer were miserably disappointed when\r\nthey reached stretches near the source and found nothing but flour\r\ngold. This same feature has been noticed in some of the Alaskan\r\nrivers. It is quite within the bounds of probability that no very rich\r\nquartz veins exist in Alaska. It does not follow from the richness of\r\nthe placers that the gold is derived from very rich quartz lodes,\r\nbecause this amount of gold may really represent the product of a vast\r\namount of rock that has been ground to powder and washed away in the\r\ncourse of ages. The gold would not travel far, and the deposits being\r\nunearthed to-day have been accumulating in these northern streams\r\nsince the world was young; water-courses are nature's ground sluices.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that one stream has cut through the drainage of\r\nanother. Sometimes this has impoverished the first and enriched the\r\nsecond, while in other cases the reverse has obtained. Upheavals have\r\nformed faults[1] and fractured the strata, and the gold may have been\r\ndeposited by solution in these fractures. Often the soil will have\r\nbeen washed away from near the top of the mountain, so that layers of\r\nstratified rock are seen to be duplicated on each side while they are\r\ncovered at the summit. The prospector keeps his eye open as he goes\r\nalong and notes carefully the character of the fragments of rock he\r\nfinds in the streams. Quartz, diorite, diabase, and porphyry pebbles\r\nare grounds for expecting a profitable result, but of course there is\r\nno certainty of such a happy issue. As soon as the district begins to\r\nbe fairly well known certain discoveries are made that invariably\r\nrender prospecting easier. Local peculiarities are noted; certain\r\ncharacters are found to be common to the ore-bearing bodies or\r\ndeposits; the lines of deposits become known, and a good deal of light\r\nis then shed upon a very difficult problem. As a rule, when the\r\nfragments of quartz, pyrite, chalcopyrite, or galena are rough, they\r\nhave not traveled far, and the lode from which they have been derived\r\nshould be close at hand. Water and attrition soon round these minerals\r\non their sharp edges, and thus show that they have come from some\r\nlittle distance.\r\n\r\n          [1] Dislocation of the strata.\r\n\r\nIn some countries, especially where vegetation is scanty, the outcrop\r\nof a body of mineral may be traced by a difference in the vegetation.\r\nIn South Africa a chain of pools usually follows the course of a line\r\nfault, which in its turn marks where an intrusive lode carrying\r\nmineral separates two different formations. As a rule, any heavy\r\nmineral is worth investigating. Even in remote regions silver,\r\nmercury, tin, nickel, platinum, copper, and several other metals are\r\nworth paying attention to. If they are too far away from the railroad\r\nor the steamboat to-day they may not be so next year, for civilization\r\nadvances with giant stride in these days and never faster than when\r\ntransportation companies are reaching forth to some newly discovered\r\nmineral field.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest drawbacks to prospecting in the North is the dense\r\ngrowths of moss and forest that cover the ground. In most of the\r\nWestern states, in South Africa, and in Australia this drawback does\r\nnot exist and prospecting was by that much the easier. However, as a\r\ncompensation, there is abundant water in Alaska and the Northwest,\r\nwhile it was and is almost entirely absent in several other regions\r\nthat possess immense bodies of ore which are not available for this\r\nvery reason.\r\n\r\nQuartz has been called the mother of gold, and certainly quartz and\r\ngold are inseparably connected to-day. As to where gold may be found\r\nthe best reply that can be given is in the words of the old miner,\r\nwho, when asked that question, said: \"Where it be's; there it be's,\"\r\nand then added, \"and there ben't I.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough most prospectors travel alone from sheer necessity, there can\r\nbe no doubt that three or four men forming a party and working\r\ntogether have the advantage. They can do their work cheaper, more\r\nthoroughly, and more surely. By co-operating they may carry a more\r\ncomplete outfit. Should any accident happen help is at hand, whereas\r\nthe solitary wanderer often dies as the result of some accident that\r\nwould have been trivial had he had a companion. Three or four claims\r\nmay be worked in conjunction with one another at far less\r\nproportionate expense than a single one could.\r\n\r\nNature's preparation for the reception of great ore deposits is\r\nsomewhat as follows: The crust of the earth is prepared for the\r\nreception of the metals by great outbursts of igneous or melted rocks;\r\nthe metals themselves being carried in suspension in the heated water\r\nthat everywhere traverses the strata. These metals are deposited in\r\nthe veins as soon as the waters begin to cool, and the pressure to\r\nwhich they were subjected from deep down in the earth's crust is\r\nremoved. A great mineral country is usually marked by the outcrops of\r\nthe veins being persistent in their courses and traceable for many\r\nmiles, though very probably many breaks may occur in these outcrops.\r\nThe rocks associated with great ore bodies are lime, porphyry,\r\ngranite, shales, slates, quartzites, and diabase. Fragments of mineral\r\nand gangue, known to the miners as float, may be littered over the\r\nhills and encumber the courses of the stream. A central line of\r\neruption may often be traced by masses of altered rock, and beds of\r\nlava or other volcanic products. We find the granite has been melted\r\nand the limestone has acquired magnesia, and thus become dolomatized.\r\n\r\nWhenever a heavy deposit of pyrites, or mundic, is found mineral\r\nprobably exists below. The cubes of pyrite are not always valueless,\r\nthey may contain gold in addition to the iron and sulphur. When the\r\npyrites decay under the influence of the weather, and leave the quartz\r\nhoneycombed, these cavities often contain concentrated gold; for which\r\nreason you often get a higher assay from the surface than from any\r\npoint lower down in the vein. In sinking the shaft soon gets below\r\nthis altered quartz and the ores are then combined with sulphur. They\r\nhave become sulphides, and are harder to treat. The prospector should\r\ntherefore act very cautiously when trying to develop a mine with a\r\nsmall capital behind him; because, although the first ore may be\r\nadapted for stamping, he may find, before he has gone down fifty feet,\r\nthat it can only be treated in a smelter, and that all the money he\r\nhas put into crushing apparatus is wasted.\r\n\r\nWithout the prospector there would be no mining and the world would\r\nyet be in the stone age. He is not appreciated at anything like his\r\nreal worth. He requires ability and experience, push and perseverance.\r\nProspecting is a search for valuable minerals. He may not be very\r\ndeeply learned in either geology or mineralogy, but he must have a\r\nkeen eye and good natural powers of observation.\r\n\r\nThere are some sixty or seventy elements in the world, and the most\r\ncommon is oxygen. Nearly all the coloring matter of rocks comes from\r\niron. Wind, frost, rain, snow, and heat, cause a crumbling of the\r\ndifferent rocks, and running water wears them away, and carries off\r\nand distributes the particles. By this agency, and by floating ice,\r\nthey are often removed to long distances. The action of internal heat\r\nrenews the deposits of mineral by eruption, or by hot springs, but\r\nthis means of renewal was much more powerful in the past than it is\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nOrganic matter found in the crust of the earth was derived from\r\nanimals or vegetables. Coal is a legacy from forests that flourished\r\nages ago, while petroleum is all that remains of vast schools of\r\nfishes that swarmed in Devonian seas.\r\n\r\nStratified rocks are either sand, clay, or calcareous, which means\r\nlime-bearing. In their natural position they were horizontal, but\r\nowing to subsequent volcanic action they are, in some localities,\r\ntilted at all conceivable angles. The eruptive rocks have burst\r\nthrough them in places, changed their character, divided them by\r\nintrusive masses, and generally enriched them with mineral deposits.\r\n\r\nEverything now known points to the theory that the contents of veins\r\nwere deposited in the lodes by infiltration. In a few instances famous\r\nmines have no veins, but are literally hills of mineral; they are then\r\nof low grade, but much more remunerative than average high grade\r\nmines, owing the vast quantity of ore, and the ease with which it can\r\nbe mined. The famous Treadwell mine, on Douglas Island, Alaska, has\r\nore that is worth less than four dollars a ton, but it is quarried,\r\nand 640 stamps work day and night. There is about a dollar a ton\r\nprofit, and hundreds of thousands of tons are treated annually. The\r\ntin mine known as Mount Bischoff, in Tasmania, and the Burra copper\r\nmine in Australia are other instances. Each of these deposits was\r\nfound as an outcropping on the bare top of a low hill, and none of\r\nthem has walls.\r\n\r\nA fault may throw the vein up or down, and a good deal of exploration\r\nmay have to be done before it is recovered.\r\n\r\nA lenticular vein consists of a series of double pointed ore bodies\r\nlike lenses which may be strung out, overlapping, or not.\r\n\r\nThe outcrop of a vein is never the same as its strike, except on a\r\nlevel surface.\r\n\r\nA stringer of ore branching off from the main vein is known as a\r\nchute, shoot, or chimney.\r\n\r\nIn developing a ledge or lode, first find out what the ore is. Gold is\r\nshown in the mortar, especially after roasting. Silver may be\r\nrecognized at sight, or by assay tests, or blow pipe; copper, by its\r\nvivid colors,--green or blue for carbonate and red for oxide or\r\nmetallic copper. The ore often differs in various parts of the vein.\r\nExplore your lode along the surface, across, and down its dip. When\r\nyou find it continuous it will be time enough to think of a vertical\r\nshaft. The top of a shaft must be timbered with logs, so as to give\r\nsufficient fall to get rid of the mineral when it is hoisted.\r\n\r\nThe first thing the prospector has to consider is his outfit. The more\r\ncomplete this is the better, but ninety-nine times out of a hundred\r\nthe difficulties of transportation in a wild region are so enormous\r\nthat he will have to do without a great many things that he would like\r\nto have. He must endeavor to make up for the lack of tools by\r\ningenuity; then he may get along fairly well. A pan, he must have. In\r\nthis he will wash carefully all his samples. Then, a flask of\r\nquicksilver is more precious to him even than gold; for, having it, he\r\ncan resort to pan-amalgamation, which will save the precious metal\r\neven when it is in minute particles.\r\n\r\nThis process may be described as follows: A pound or two of the ore in\r\npowder is placed in the pan and water is added until the mass becomes\r\na thin pulp. One ounce of quicksilver and a small piece of that deadly\r\npoison, known to the chemist as cyanide of potash, and as prussic acid\r\nto the ordinary man, should be added, and the mass should be stirred\r\nthoroughly, for two hours if you can stand it. Then turn in water and\r\nwash off the dirt and the amalgam will be found in the bottom of the\r\npan. This you must collect very carefully. You should have a square\r\npiece of chamois skin or a piece of strong white cotton cloth. In\r\neither case the amalgam is put in the center of this square and the\r\ncloth twisted until all the superfluous quicksilver is pressed out and\r\nyour amalgam remains nearly free from mercury. This amalgam placed on\r\na shovel and held over a brisk fire will soon show the yellow color of\r\ngold. If you have no mould you may make one of clay, put your gold\r\ntherein with a little borax, and very soon, the fire being hot enough,\r\nyou will have a tiny ingot of the precious metal. But most prospectors\r\nare satisfied when they have obtained their sponge gold, and do not\r\ncarry their operations further in these rough and ready tests.\r\n\r\nThe prospector of to-day is often a very different man from his\r\npredecessor of a generation ago. The old gold hunter used to sally\r\nforth armed with a pick, shovel and pan, and usually a very little\r\ngrub. In his stead men are now taking the field who have had the\r\nbenefits of a thorough education, both practical and theoretical, and\r\nprovided with all the equipment necessary for their work. Some of\r\nthese men carry an outfit somewhat as follows: An iron mortar holding\r\nhalf a gallon, together with a pestle a rough scale for pulp, a more\r\ndelicate one showing troy grains and pennyweights, a 40-mesh sieve, a\r\nburro furnace and muffle, one cupel mould, a couple of dozen\r\nscorifiers, tongs to handle the cupel and scorifiers, two annealing\r\ncups, a spirit lamp, a dozen test tubes, a pouring mould, five or six\r\npounds of borax and about as much carbonate of soda, five pounds of\r\nbone ash, ditto of granulated lead, a pint of nitric acid, ditto of\r\nhydrochloric acid, ditto sulphuric acid, ditto of ammonia, twice as\r\nmuch alcohol and two pounds or so of granulated zinc.\r\n\r\nAs a blow pipe outfit he will take a blow pipe, spirit lamp, nitrate\r\nof cobalt in solution, cyanide of potash, yellow prussiate of potash,\r\nred prussiate of potash, a sheet or two of filtering paper and a\r\ncouple of three-inch glass filters. With this outfit he can determine\r\nany mineral he may come across.\r\n\r\nBy patience and observation the man who starts out to take up\r\nprospecting as a road to fortune may easily master the rudiments of\r\nhis business. It will not take him long to become familiar with the\r\ncommoner rocks, and the more valuable ores. His own rough tests in the\r\nfield must be confirmed by competent assayers upon his return to\r\ncivilization, and in this matter he should be very guarded. The most\r\nreliable assays are made either at the different government assay\r\noffices or by some of the large metallurgical works whose reputation\r\nis world wide. Prospecting is hard work, but the life is healthy and\r\nfull of excitement, only the explorer should have courage, hope, and\r\ngood temper, for each and every one will be as necessary in his chosen\r\nvocation as his pan and pick.\r\n\r\nWhen alluvial or placer gold has been found it is reasonable to\r\nsuppose that the vein from which it was derived may also reward\r\ndiligent search, for it is undoubtedly true that most placer gold has\r\ncome from quartz veins. This, however, is believed not to be\r\ninvariably the case, a recent school of mineralogists contending that\r\npure masses of alluvial gold have been formed from the accretion or\r\ngrowth of the gold deposited from certain gold salts. This is in any\r\ncase probably exceptional, and the prospector who finds gold in gravel\r\nshould seek in the adjacent country for the quartz lodes from which it\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nImportant deposits may be expected at or about the line of\r\nunconformability where slates, shales, quartzites, sandstones,\r\nlimestones, schists and other sedimentary deposits are pierced by\r\nintrusive masses of igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nVeins filling the cracks that once existed between two differing rocks\r\nare known as contact veins. Such veins are often very rich. Curiously\r\nenough large masses of true igneous rock rarely contain valuable\r\ndeposits of mineral, but where such intrusive masses cut dikes or\r\nwalls of porphyry, or diorite, the region is worthy of careful\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POCKET LENS.]\r\n\r\nIn an open country the prospector should keep to the hill tops if on\r\nthe lookout for veins, as the outcrops show more distinctly on the\r\nbare ridges, but alluvial deposits are only found in valleys and along\r\nthe borders of streams. In any case, much of the northern part of this\r\ncontinent can only be prospected by following the streams, on account\r\nof the dense growth of forest with which the soil is covered. The true\r\nline of strike of a vein can be determined only on a level stretch.\r\nThe line of strike and the line of dip are always at right angles to\r\none another; the outcrop may follow the strike or it may not.\r\n\r\nA pick, shovel, and pan, are absolutely necessary to a prospector's\r\nproper equipment. A good pocket lens, cheesecloth screen, and small\r\niron pestle and mortar are often useful. The pan is the most essential\r\npart of the outfit, and is always bright from use.\r\n\r\nThe regular gold miner's pan is 13-3/4 inches in diameter across the\r\ntop, 10 inches across the bottom and 2-1/8 inches deep. The best are\r\nmade of sheet iron and have a joint around the bottom rim which is of\r\nsome assistance in retaining the spangles of gold.\r\n\r\nA more primitive instrument than the pan is the batea. This requires\r\nmore skill than the pan, and is much in favor with South American\r\nminers. It is made of hard wood, 20 inches in diameter, 2-1/2 inches\r\ndeep in the center, inside measurement, and sloping gradually to\r\nnothing at the sides.\r\n\r\nThe horn spoon has been handed on from antiquity. It is made from a\r\nblack ox horn, at least a black one is the best as it shows the gold\r\nbetter; it is eight to ten inches long by three inches wide, cut off\r\nobliquely.\r\n\r\nWhen gold is suspected in quartz, but there is visible to the naked\r\neye more or less iron, copper, and other base metals, it is well to\r\ncrush the quartz into coarse fragments. Roast on a shovel or other\r\nconvenient tool over a hot fire, and finally pulverize in the mortar.\r\nIf panned it will now reveal much of its gold, while, had these\r\nmeasures not been taken, the sample might have given negative results\r\nand been declared valueless.\r\n\r\nAfter pulverizing, the ore should be passed through the cheese cloth\r\nscreen before panning. If the approximate value of the ore is sought,\r\nthe sample must be dried and weighed before crushing; and the\r\nresulting gold weighed. Thus:\r\n\r\nSample is to 2,000 lbs. as gold found is to Ans.\r\n\r\nAbout 13 cubic feet of quartz weigh a ton before being disturbed; when\r\nbroken to medium sized lumps 20 cubic feet may be taken as\r\nrepresenting a ton. Although experience teaches the miner to estimate\r\nvery closely the value of his sample, it is better for the tyro to\r\nhave a small pair of scales with grain weights. A grain of gold, if\r\ntolerably pure, is equal to four cents. Above all things avoid the too\r\ncommon error of panning the pick of the rock, as a false estimate is\r\nbound to follow and only too probably eventual loss.\r\n\r\nA yard of gravel before being dug makes one and a half yards\r\nafterwards. A pan of dirt is usually about 20 pounds, although it is\r\nnot well to fill quite full in actual work.\r\n\r\nMany a valuable mine has been found by following up \"float\" ore. Float\r\nis detached fragments of the vein or gangue, and it becomes more and\r\nmore abundant as the lode is approached until it finally ceases\r\nabruptly. This indicates that the vein has been reached or passed, and\r\na trench dug throughout the alluvial soil at right angles to the\r\nassumed line of the vein will probably reveal it. The float and\r\nmineral of course drift down hill; if the side of the mountain be\r\nsaddle-shaped the float will spread out like a fan as it washes down,\r\nbut if concave the force of gravity will concentrate it within a\r\nnarrow space in the ravine. Float found at the foot of a hill has\r\ncome, as a rule, from that hill. The nearer the vein the less worn\r\nwill be the edges of the float and mineral. The gangue or vein-rock in\r\nwhich the metal is found may be calcite or calc spar, fluor spar,\r\nheavy spar or baryta, or quartz. Gold is almost always found in this\r\nlast matrix. The upper parts of most quartz lodes are usually\r\noxidized, that is to say, the atmosphere has acted upon the iron\r\npyrites, freeing the sulphur and staining the quartz yellow, red, or\r\nbrown, by oxide of iron. This is known as \"gossan\" or the \"iron hat.\"\r\nSuch quartz is frequently honeycombed and rotten. Below the water\r\nlevel these veins run to sulphides in which decomposition has not set\r\nin, and the gold contained in the quartz is no longer \"free milling,\"\r\ni.e. will not give up its gold to mercury without a preliminary\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nWhenever the explorer comes across a mass of gossan he should sink a\r\ntrial shaft to the vein, as it is almost certain that below the\r\noxidized sulphides a body of mineral exists likely to encourage mining\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nNative gold is malleable, will flatten out under the hammer, and a\r\nsteel knife will cut it with ease. It almost invariably contains\r\nsilver, sometimes to the extent of one-fifth. A little practice will\r\nenable the prospector to recognize it, for there is but one king\r\nmetal. Much gold is derived from copper and iron pyrites, and silver\r\nand lead ores are a very large source of supply.\r\n\r\nGold is found in gravel of every variety, from finest pipe-clay to\r\nboulders weighing tons. Sometimes volcanic eruptions have covered\r\nthese deposits since the ancient rivers laid them down, and in many\r\ncases their courses do not in the least agree with the valleys of the\r\nshrunken streams that have replaced them.\r\n\r\nGold may be distributed through the whole thickness of a bed, but\r\nninety-nine times out of a hundred the richest layer of gravel is just\r\nabove the bed rock upon which all the gravel rests. Gold may even be\r\nfound among the grass roots, especially in dry localities where there\r\nhas been little water to carry it downward. When the bed rock consists\r\nof upturned slates the gold frequently penetrates it for some little\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nSand is nearly always poorer than gravel.\r\n\r\nThe experience of miners in the Victoria gold fields is that gold is\r\nalways found on the bars or points, and not in the deep pools and\r\nbends.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty with which any but the very finest particles of\r\ngold can be moved by water accounts for the value of the deposits\r\ndepending largely upon the local rocks. It is very fortunate that\r\ngold's specific gravity is so great, for were it less its recovery\r\nwould be much more difficult. The sluices and other apparatus of the\r\nminer are really nothing but the operations of nature imitated on a\r\nmuch smaller scale. There is one thing, however, time, that nature can\r\nafford to expend in prodigious periods, while man must not waste a\r\nsingle minute.\r\n\r\nIt not being possible to point out where the ancient river beds lie,\r\nsmothered as they are by hundreds of feet of overlying drift, lava,\r\nand other later deposits, the only feasible plan is a series of boring\r\nwith the diamond drill.\r\n\r\nWhen gold has been discovered the finder must act with the greatest\r\nprudence, for even gold may be bought too dear. The surest test is a\r\nmill run, that is passing 10 to 50 tons through all the operations of\r\ncrushing, milling, roasting, amalgamating, etc., and so ascertaining\r\nwhat returns are likely to be obtainable when the deposit is worked on\r\na commercial scale. True sampling is necessary. All parts of the vein\r\nshould be included, and the lode cross-cut by galleries in more than\r\none spot. It is the very great necessity of these expensive\r\npreparatory explorations that has given rise to the saying, \"Quartz\r\nmining is for rich men.\"\r\n\r\nMany gold mines have been abandoned as unprofitable that could have\r\nbeen mined at a profit had their owners been wealthy and enterprising\r\nenough to do a great deal of expensive prospecting by diamond drill,\r\ncross cuts, drifts and rises. In one instance that came to the\r\nwriter's knowledge a clever mining engineer cleared nearly $200,000\r\nprofit by leasing for a term of years a gold mine that was supposed to\r\nbe exhausted. A drill hole sunk less than 50 feet below the old\r\nworkings revealed a pocket of ore in the vein, and paying quartz was\r\nfound for many hundred feet below.\r\n\r\nWith the improvements in electricity made recently a cheap power has\r\nbeen provided that will permit many mines to be reopened. The saving\r\nin working expenses effected by introducing electricity is often very\r\nlarge; after the plant is once installed the cost is almost nil where\r\nturbines can be employed to furnish the power to the generators.\r\nMachinery capable of delivering power at a distance of several miles\r\nfrom the plant, may be operated at very reasonable cost as compared to\r\nthat of other prime movers.\r\n\r\nDiscoveries of many deposits that have in time been successfully mined\r\nwere the result of chance. No skill guided the finder; he merely\r\nstumbled upon his luck just as the wayfarer once in a while hits his\r\ntoe against a well-filled pocketbook. For instance, a South Australian\r\nsquatter picked up a piece of copper ore that a wombat had thrown out\r\nof his burrow, and the result was the discovery of the great Wallaroo\r\nlode. The first diamond from South Africa was picked up by an ignorant\r\nbush boy and kept with a lot of worthless pebbles in the private\r\ncollection of the boy's master; no suspicion existed of its value\r\nuntil a passing trader had carried it away and obtained $2,500 for it\r\nin Capetown. Gold was first discovered in California in 1848 by the\r\nsuperintendent of a sawmill who saw it glistening in the flume.\r\nSimilarly gold was discovered in both Australia and Brazil by the\r\npurest chance. Had not a tree been uprooted by the wind the vast\r\ndeposits of soft hematite iron ore in the Biwabic iron mines of the\r\nMesabi range, Minnesota, might have remained unknown for many a long\r\nyear to come. In the desolate region to the northward of Lake Huron\r\ngreat stores of nickel ore exist. These mines, which may some day\r\nregulate the price of the metal all the world over, were exposed in a\r\nrailway cutting; no one dreamed of their existence. The Redington\r\nquicksilver mine in California was discovered by some roadmakers.\r\nTradition relates that the enormously rich silver mines of Potosi, in\r\nBolivia, were discovered by the accidental uprooting of a bush having\r\nspangles of silver ore attached to its roots. This was in 1538, and\r\ntwo hundred years later a similar streak of luck revealed the wealth\r\nof the Catorce district of Mexico, from which in thirty years, ore to\r\nthe value of $35,000,000 was taken.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the search for one mineral often leads to the discovery of\r\nanother. The Comstock lode was first worked for gold, and the miners\r\nthrew away the black sulphide of silver worth $3,000 to the ton. The\r\nBroken Hill mine in Australia was claimed as a tin deposit by its\r\nfinder; it is now the greatest silver producer in Australasia. Such\r\ninstances could be multiplied almost indefinitely, chance entering\r\ninto a majority of mineral discoveries. On the other hand, it has\r\nhappened, not infrequently, that purely scientific deductions and\r\ncalculations have brought to light stores of mineral wealth.\r\n\r\nCertain minerals are likely to be found associated. Cassiterite goes\r\nwith boron and tourmaline, topaz, fluor spar and lithia-mica; all\r\ncontaining fluorine. It is also found with wolfram, chlorite and\r\narsenical pyrites. Magnetite is often accompanied by rocks containing\r\ngarnet, epidote and hornblende. Zinc blend and galena may occupy the\r\nsame vein, which is likely to be of baryta or heavy spar. Much galena\r\ncarries silver. Gold is associated with many metallic sulphides such\r\nas iron, magnetic, and copper pyrites, mispickel, galena, blend,\r\nstibnite and tetrahedrite. Gypsum accompanies salt.\r\n\r\nSurface indications may be described as: Form of ground, color,\r\noutcrop, decomposed and detached mineral, mineral deposits from\r\nsprings, altered or peculiar vegetation and other similar guides. A\r\nhard quartz outcrop often stands up like a wall and is traceable for\r\nmiles. The Rainbow silver bearing lode of Butte, Montana, stood 20\r\nfeet above the surface. Soft minerals, such as clay, are cut into and\r\nsunk below the surrounding level. Deposits of Kaolin or China clay are\r\nusually so found.\r\n\r\nAny special bright coloration of the rocks of a district merits\r\ninvestigation. Copper gives green, blue, and red stains; iron, red or\r\nbrown; manganese, black; lead, green, yellow or white; cobalt, pink;\r\ncinnabar or quicksilver, vermilion. The nickel deposits of New\r\nCaledonia were made known to the world by the explorer Garnier in\r\n1863, his curiosity having been aroused by the delicate green coating\r\ngiven the rocks by an ore containing water, quartz, nickel and\r\nmagnesium.\r\n\r\nHard beds of shale decompose on the surface into soft clay, and a\r\nstill more noticeable change is the conversion of ores containing\r\nsulphur into oxides. This chemical change causes the gossan or \"iron\r\nhat,\" for which token of underlying wealth the prospector should be\r\neternally watchful. This alteration may extend downward four or five\r\nhundred feet from the surface, but in such cases the true weathering\r\nhas ceased long before the limit of discoloration is reached, and the\r\nchange of substance is due to the filtering of surface waters through\r\nthe vein.\r\n\r\nGossan varies greatly in its nature. Galena becomes anglesite,\r\ncerussite, pyromorphite and mimetite. Copper pyrite changes into\r\nnative copper, melaconite, cuprite, malachite, chessylite, or perhaps\r\ninto a phosphate, arsenate, or silicate of the metal. Carbonate of\r\nmanganese gives the black oxides and silver sulphide ores are, after\r\nweathering, known as native silver, kerargyrite and embolite.\r\n\r\nThe ore in the gossan is very generally more valuable than it will be\r\nbelow, and this is especially true of gold and silver ores. The gold\r\nhaving been set free from the close embrace in which the iron pyrite\r\nheld it previous to the latter's oxidation, it is now readily caught\r\nby quicksilver. Silver under similar conditions becomes chloride, and\r\nlikewise amalgamates without difficulty.\r\n\r\nSeams containing native sulphur often show no trace of that element on\r\nthe surface, having weathered into a soft, white, gray or\r\nyellowish-white granular, or pulverulent, variety of gypsum.\r\n\r\nVeins of asbestos often decompose into a white powder found in the\r\ncrevices of the rocks; fibrous asbestos existing in the interior.\r\n\r\nPetroleum shows in an iridescent film upon still pools, and the odor\r\nis a sure guide to its nature.\r\n\r\nA \"dipping-needle\" is valuable to the prospector on the lookout for\r\niron ore; by its use he may discover masses of magnetic ore and trace\r\ntheir extent. As he carries the compass over the ground the needle\r\ndips toward any iron mass he approaches; directly over the ore it\r\nbecomes vertical.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MINER'S DIPPING NEEDLE.]\r\n\r\nIn a wilderness country strength of body and endurance are important\r\nqualifications. The prospector must, moreover, have such general\r\nknowledge of geology and mineralogy as to be able to recognize all\r\nvaluable minerals and confirm his conjecture by simple tests. Pick,\r\nshovel and pan must be handled skillfully, while the rifle, shotgun\r\nand paddle must also be understood. For in the unsettled parts of the\r\ncountry the traveler must even yet rely to some extent upon the fish\r\nand game he may be able to secure, and every old prospector becomes a\r\ntrained hunter and camper. Knowing how to bake bread is sometimes more\r\nvaluable than much mathematics; ability to build a rough boat is often\r\nthe one hope of salvation.\r\n\r\nIn sinking a short shaft in a sunny country a large mirror, inclined\r\nat a suitable angle over the shaft, will give sufficient light.\r\n\r\nLodes or veins following the general trend of the auriferous quartz\r\nare much more likely to be rich than are those that cross it. Gold is\r\nnever distributed evenly in veins, though it may be in great beds of\r\nlow grade material; but more often rich areas alternate with barren\r\nportions.\r\n\r\nWhere quartz veins are small and the rich pockets separated by wide\r\nintervals of poor gangue the gravel of the district will usually be\r\nsimilar in character. As this condition obtains in the upper Yukon\r\ndistrict as far as the gravels are concerned, it will probably be\r\nfound to hold good for the quartz leads, when they shall have been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nThe more nearly the gold formation approaches to the crystalline\r\nschists, the poorer will the quality of the gold be through the larger\r\npercentage of silver found in it. In slates the proportion may be 22\r\ngold to 1 silver; in schists it has been known to be a ratio of 1 to\r\n1.\r\n\r\nWith the discovery of valuable gold-bearing gravel on the bare\r\nhillsides of the Northwest, a vast region has been added to the area\r\nthe prospector may explore to advantage. No experience acquired in\r\nordinary American placer grounds is likely to be of much use in\r\ndetecting these higher gold-bearing gravels of the Yukon, but they\r\nappear to be somewhat similar in character to the New Zealand\r\nterraces. Terrace-prospecting requires perseverance and the use of\r\nsome brains, as it is infinitely harder than creek-prospecting. These\r\nterraces or benches are the remains of old river beds. The whole bench\r\nmust be carefully scanned over because the gold is quite as likely to\r\nbe in one part as in the other. Sometimes it is in half a dozen\r\ndifferent layers one above the other. Sometimes the old river terraces\r\nare entirely covered by landslides, and the majority of such deposits\r\nare not likely ever to be found, as it is almost impossible to guess\r\nat locations.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand gold has been found on table-lands nearly 6,000 feet\r\nabove sea level, and according to recent information valuable claims\r\nhave been discovered in Alaska on the very summits of the rounded\r\nhills on each side of El Dorado creek.\r\n\r\nTo understand how such deposits as those of the Northwest may have\r\nbeen made, suppose that such a vein as that of the Idaho, which has\r\nbeen worked for a depth 1,700 feet by a width of 1,000 feet, and from\r\nwhich $17,000,000 have been taken, to have been worn down by glacial\r\nor other forces. Is it not conceivable that the gold would gradually\r\nhave accumulated in the nearest canyon?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOLLY.]\r\n\r\nTo obtain suitable samples of the vein a dolly is an efficient\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nThis is practically a very simple, crude, stamp mill. On the end of a\r\nsolid log, firmly fixed in the ground and standing four feet or so\r\nabove the surface, a square 6-inch hole is cut in which are fitted\r\nwrought iron bars 3 inches deep by 1/2 inch wide, and separated by\r\nequal intervals. These bars taper below so as to permit free passage\r\nof the pounded mineral. A wooden box surrounding the grating keeps the\r\nore in place. A block of wood, shod with iron, forms the stamper. The\r\nminer hauls on the handles at every blow. The gold is saved on the\r\nlower table.\r\n\r\nNo one of experience in mining would look for brown hematite in a\r\ngranite range, nor for black band, though such might be a likely\r\nregion for red hematite or magnatite.\r\n\r\nThe explorer should be familiar in theory at least with the locality\r\nwhere he may expect to find valuable minerals. For instance, should he\r\nbe searching for some heavy, detached substance that is usually found\r\nin placer deposits he will keep to the low ground and examine\r\ncarefully the beds of the streams. On the other hand, should his quest\r\nbe for some ore that is more properly a component of a lode or vein he\r\nwill examine the side hills and summits where denudation will\r\ncertainly have exposed such deposits. Then he must know the appearance\r\nof each ore, and with the methods of making rough and ready tests he\r\nmust be perfectly familiar.\r\n\r\nGold is always more or less intimately associated with quartz. Oxide\r\nof tin is said never to have been found more than two miles from some\r\ngranite rock, one of the components of which was muscovite or white\r\nmica. The junction of slates and schists with igneous or metamorphic\r\nrocks often proves a valuable find of mineral.\r\n\r\nRocks for the purposes of the explorer may be grouped under three\r\nheads: Igneous; metamorphic; stratified. The first includes lavas;\r\ntrachytes, grayish with rough fracture and mainly glassy; dark\r\nbasalts: and traps, such as greenstone. Obsidian is a volcanic glass.\r\nMetamorphic rocks are thought to have once been stratified, but to\r\nhave been altered by heat. They comprise granite, of quartz feldspar\r\nand mica; syenite, containing hornblende instead of mica; gneiss, like\r\ngranite, but showing lines of stratification; mica schist, made up of\r\nmica and quartz and separating easily into layers; slates.\r\n\r\nStratified rocks are those deposits from water, such as sandstone,\r\nlimestone, clay, etc.\r\n\r\nA prospecting shaft need not be of large dimensions. One 4 feet square\r\nis amply large for any depth down to 30 feet, but it must be kept\r\nplumb.\r\n\r\nSometimes shafts are sunk through the pay streak in alluvial gravel,\r\nwithout it being detected. Frequent panning will guard against this\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\nIn the Klondike region it is said early prospectors missed very rich\r\ndeposits, that have since been discovered, by stopping short of true\r\nbed rock, being misled by a bed of harder gravel that they thought was\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nSilver almost invariably carries some gold. The dark ironstone hat\r\nalready referred to is a good indication of silver ore beneath; it is\r\ngenerally composed of conglomerates cemented by oxides of iron and\r\nmanganese.\r\n\r\nGalena, which is sometimes so rich in silver as to be worth working\r\nfor that metal, may often be followed by surface indications; namely,\r\na white limy track with detached fragments of float ore in the surface\r\nsoil. The blowpipe or fire assay quickly determines silver ore.\r\n\r\nTin in lode, stream, or alluvial deposits occurs only as an oxide, but\r\nits appearance is varied. It may be almost any color and shape. It is\r\nalways near granite, containing white mica known as muscovite.\r\n\r\nThe minerals for which it is most easily mistaken are:\r\n\r\n                 Sp. gravity.        Streak.\r\n    Wolfram      7 to 7-1/2    Red, brown or black.\r\n    Rutile       4.2           Light brown.\r\n    Tourmaline   3.2           Whitish.\r\n    Black Jack   4.3           Yellow, white.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic or dipping needle is used in New Jersey, as follows,\r\naccording to the State Geologist, W. H. Scranton, M.E.: \"An\r\nattraction which is confined to a very small spot and is lost in\r\npassing a few feet from it, is most likely to be caused by a boulder\r\nof ore or particles of magnetite with rock. An attraction which\r\ncontinues on steadily in the direction of the strike of the rock for a\r\ndistance of many feet or rods, indicates a vein of ore; and if it is\r\npositive and strongest towards the southwest, it is reasonable to\r\nconclude that the vein begins with the attraction there. If the\r\nattraction diminishes in going northwest, and finally dies out without\r\nbecoming negative, it indicates that the vein has continued on without\r\nbreak or ending until too far off to move the compass needle. If, in\r\npassing towards the northwest, along the line of attraction, the south\r\npole is drawn down, it indicates the end of the vein or an offset.\r\nIf, on continuing further, still in the same direction, positive\r\nattraction is found, it shows that the vein is not ended, but if no\r\nattraction is shown, there is no indication as to the continuance of\r\nthe ore.\r\n\r\n\"In crossing veins of ore from southwest to northwest, when the dip of\r\nthe rock and ore is as usual to the southeast, positive attraction is\r\nfirst observed to come on gradually, and the northwest edge of the\r\nvein is indicated by the needle suddenly showing negative attraction\r\njust at the point of passing off it. This change of attraction will\r\nbe less marked as the depth of the vein is greater, or as the strike\r\nis nearer north and south. The steadiness and continuance of the\r\nattraction is a much better indication of ore than the strength or\r\namount of the attraction. The ore may vary in its susceptibility to\r\nthe magnetic influence from impurities in its substance; it does vary\r\naccording to the position in which it lies, that is according to its\r\ndip and strike; and it also varies very much according to its distance\r\nbeneath the surface.\"\r\n\r\nFurther instructions are given in the paper from which the foregoing\r\nextract was taken, some of which follow:\r\n\r\n\"It is sufficient to say that the first examinations are made by\r\npassing over the ground with the compass in a northwest and southwest\r\ndirection, at intervals of a few rods, until indications of ore are\r\nfound. Then the ground should be examined more carefully by crossing\r\nthe line of attraction at intervals of a few feet, and marking the\r\npoints upon which observations have been made, and recording the\r\namount of attraction. Observations with the ordinary compass should be\r\nmade, and the variation of the horizontal needle be noted. In this way\r\nmaterials may soon be accumulated for staking out the line of\r\nattraction, or for constructing a map for study or reference.\r\n\r\n\"After sufficient exploration with the magnetic needle, it still\r\nremains to prove the value of the vein by uncovering the ore,\r\nexamining its quality, measuring the size of the vein, and estimating\r\nthe cost of mining and marketing it. Uncovering should first be done\r\nin trenches dug across the line of attraction, and carried quite down\r\nto the rock. When the ore is in this way proved to be of value regular\r\nmining may begin. In places where there are offsets in the ore, or\r\nwhere it has been subject to bends, folds, or other irregularities, so\r\nthat the miner is at fault in what direction to proceed, explorations\r\nmay be made with the diamond drill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nHOW TO TEST FOR MINERALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the mineralogist wishes to know the names of the specimen he\r\nholds in his hand, he, in the case of a mineral difficult to\r\ndetermine, considers all the following properties:\r\n\r\n    Crystalline form and structure,\r\n    Cleavage,\r\n    Fracture,\r\n    Tenacity,\r\n    Hardness,\r\n    Specific Gravity as compared with that of water,\r\n    Luster,\r\n    Color and Streak,\r\n    Transparency or otherwise,\r\n    Taste,\r\n    Odor,\r\n    Chemical Composition tested by analysis,\r\n    Pyrognostic characters as determined by the use of the blowpipe,\r\n    Mode of occurrence and associated minerals.\r\n    Crystalline Form and Structure. Unfortunately the science of\r\n      crystallography is extremely complicated and long study is\r\n      necessary to master it; once acquired, however, it is of\r\n      paramount usefulness to the student. According to Dana there are\r\n      six systems, to one of which every crystal may be referred. They\r\n      are:\r\n          (1) Isometric; (2) Tetragonal; (3) Hexagonal or\r\n          Rhombohedral; (4) Orthorhombic; (5) Monoclinic; (6)\r\n          Triclinic.\r\n\r\nIn the isometric system there are three equal axes at right angles to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nIn the tetragonal system there are three axes at right angles to each\r\nother. Two of these are equal, while the third, or vertical angle, is\r\nlonger or shorter.\r\n\r\nThere are two divisions of the hexagonal system; the hexagonal system\r\nproperly so-called, and its rhombohedral division. All forms are\r\nreferred to four axes, three equal axes inclined to each other at\r\nangles 60 degrees in a common horizontal plane, and a fourth vertical\r\naxis at right angles, and longer or shorter. The rhombohedral division\r\ncomprises crystals having but three planes of symmetry, intersecting\r\nat angles of 120 degrees in the vertical axis. They are regarded as\r\nhalf forms of the corresponding hexagonal crystals.\r\n\r\nIn the orthorhombic system there are three unequal axes at right\r\nangles to each other.\r\n\r\nIn the monoclinic system there are three unequal axes, of which one,\r\nthe lateral axis, is inclined to the vertical, while the angles\r\nbetween the others are right angles.\r\n\r\nIn the triclinic system there are three unequal axes and these\r\nintersections are all oblique. The student who wishes to pursue this\r\nsubject further should consult Dana's System of Mineralogy.\r\n\r\nPhysical Mineralogy. Cleavage is the line of easiest separation in a\r\nmineral. It may be perfect, imperfect, interrupted, etc.\r\n\r\nFracture, referring to any surface except that of a cleavage fall, may\r\nbe uneven, conchoidal (shell-like), hackly (rough), etc.\r\n\r\nTenacity refers to such qualities as brittle, sectile, malleable,\r\nflexible, or elastic.\r\n\r\nHardness is represented by the difficulty with which a smooth surface\r\nis scratched. The scale in general ore was devised by Mohs. It is:\r\n\r\n1. Talc. Scratched by the finger nail.\r\n\r\n2. Gypsum. Ditto, but with more difficulty. Will not scratch a copper\r\ncoin.\r\n\r\n3. Calcite. Scratched by a copper coin.\r\n\r\n4. Fluorite. Is not scratched by a copper coin and does not scratch\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n5. Apatite. Scratches glass, but with difficulty. Is readily scratched\r\nby a knife.\r\n\r\n6. Feldspar. Scratches glass with ease. Is difficult to scratch by\r\nknife.\r\n\r\n7. Quartz. Cannot be scratched by a knife and readily scratches glass.\r\n\r\n8. Topaz. Harder.\r\n\r\n9. Corundum. Harder.\r\n\r\n10. Diamond. Scratches any other substance.\r\n\r\nHardness may be intermediate. For instance, any mineral that scratched\r\nquartz and is soft enough to be scratched by topaz, in turn would be\r\nrated at 7.5.\r\n\r\nSpecific Gravity. This is the density of mineral and other substances\r\ncompared with that of water. It is particularly valuable in\r\ndetermining heavy metals.\r\n\r\nTo find the specific gravity of any solid body divide its weight in\r\nair by the loss of weight in water, at a temperature as near 60\r\ndegrees F. as possible, and the quotient will equal the specific\r\ngravity. In the case of gases, such as nitrogen, oxygen, etc.,\r\nhydrogen is taken as the unit.\r\n\r\nLuster. There are seven kinds of luster, viz: Metallic, the luster of\r\nmetals; adamantine, that of the diamond; vitreous, of broken glass;\r\nresinous, of the yellow resins; greasy; pearly; silky. There are five\r\ndegrees of intensity of luster recognized, viz: Splendent; shining;\r\nglistening; glimmering; dull.\r\n\r\nColor and Streak.

A knowledge of these\r\nmatters often assists in a determination.\r\n\r\nA regular fire assay is not within reach of many prospectors, for the\r\nnecessary apparatus cannot, as a rule, be carried in the wilderness.\r\nWhenever possible, however, a fire assay gives the truest results,\r\nespecially in the case of gold and silver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCALE FOR WEIGHING ORE.]\r\n\r\nThe operation includes testing the ore, sampling and pulverizing,\r\nweighing the ore and reagents, calcination and roasting, reduction and\r\nfusion, distillation and sublimation, scorification and cupellation,\r\ninquartation and parting the gold and silver, weighing and tabulating.\r\n\"Notes on Assaying\" by Dr. Ricketts is a very useful manual to have at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TOLERABLY COMPLETE OUTFIT INCLUDES:\r\n\r\nA pair of scales for weighing ore and buttons of base metal. It should\r\ntake 10 ounces in each pan, and show 1/20 of a grain.\r\n\r\nA bullion scale to be kept strictly for the precious metals. Loaded\r\nwith one gramme, it should show 1/20 of a milligramme.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASSAY BALANCE FOR BULLION.]\r\n\r\nWeights. Avoirdupois; troy, metric and \"assay.\" Assay weights save\r\nmuch calculation. The unit of the system is a weight of 29.166\r\ngrammes. Its derivation is as follows:\r\n\r\n    2000 lbs. : 1 A.T. :: 1 oz. Troy : 1 milligramme.\r\n\r\nTo use this system, weigh out one A.T. of the ore and whatever number\r\nof milligrammes of gold and silver the assay gives indicates an equal\r\nnumber of Troy ounces to the ton of 2000 lbs. Avoirdupois.\r\n\r\nA muffle and a melting furnace, portable and of medium size, are\r\nhandy, though furnaces may be built of ordinary brick, lined with fire\r\nbrick, that would be better for permanent use.\r\n\r\nThe fuels may be coke, anthracite or bituminous coal, charcoal, oil or\r\ngas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASSAY FURNACE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTABLE ASSAY FURNACE.]\r\n\r\nCrucibles of black lead, French clay, Hessian sand, and quicklime are\r\nnecessary to hold the assay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: French Clay.    Hessian.\r\n\r\nCRUCIBLES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCORIFIER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEEL CUPEL MOULD.]\r\n\r\nRoasting dishes, scorifiers and cupels are required. The cupel is made\r\nof the ashes of burnt bone, and it is better to make them on the spot,\r\nas the bone ash may be carried anywhere without damage, whereas the\r\ncupels are very fragile. The bone ash is moistened with water, stamped\r\nin a cupel mould, and allowed to dry slowly. A good one will absorb\r\nits own weight of lead, but it is better to calculate on its absorbing\r\nbut three-quarters of that amount.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCORIFICATION FURNACE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCORIFICATION MOULD.]\r\n\r\nThe crucible, scorification and cupel tongs, a couple of hammers, iron\r\npestle and mortar, sieves from 20 to 100 mesh, and scorification mould\r\ncomplete the requisite tools.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAMMER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORN SPOON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEEL MORTAR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALCOHOL LAMP.]\r\n\r\nIn addition, however, the assayer will require quite a bulky lot of\r\napparatus, reagents and chemicals. All dealers keep lists of assayers'\r\nsupplies on hand, and a full and complete assortment will cost about\r\n$200 in New York or Chicago. Quart bottles, with glass stoppers;\r\nordinary corked bottles, ring stands, alcohol lamps, wash bottles,\r\ntest tubes, horn spoons, iron pans, parting flasks, annealing cups,\r\nglazed black paper--these will suffice, provided the assayer has, as\r\nwell, the outfit recommended for blow-pipe work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEST TUBE.]\r\n\r\nDry reagents, such as litharge, borax (crystallized), silica, cyanide\r\nof potassium, yellow prussiate of potash, argol, charcoal, starch,\r\nmetallic iron, pure lead, nitre, powdered lime, sulphur, carbonate of\r\nammonia and common salt are necessary. As solvents and precipitants,\r\ndistilled water, sulphuric, nitric and hydrochloric acids, chloride of\r\nsodium, nitrate of silver and sulphuretted hydrogen are also\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\nThis will seem rather a formidable list, and so, under certain\r\nconditions, it may be; indeed, where means of transport is limited,\r\nall regular assay work must be postponed until the return to\r\ncivilization. Assaying is not, however, difficult, being mostly a\r\nmatter of rule of thumb, and correct results may be arrived at without\r\na deep knowledge of chemistry, although such knowledge will never come\r\namiss.\r\n\r\nA preliminary examination will show what the ore probably is. The\r\nblow-pipe is especially useful, though to the skilled assayer often\r\nunnecessary. The ore is first powdered, and any metallic flakes picked\r\nout and tested separately. A fair sample must be selected, otherwise\r\nall the work will be thrown away and the result be valueless.\r\n\r\nThe next step is weighing the ore and the reagents. Moisture is drawn\r\noff by heating in a crucible, a low heat being sufficient. Roasting\r\nwill eliminate sulphur, antimony, arsenic, etc., and must take place\r\nin a flat dish, so that the air may have free access. The powder\r\nshould be stirred frequently.\r\n\r\nReduction is the operation of removing oxygen, and it takes place\r\nusually in a crucible or scorifier.\r\n\r\nScorification consists in placing the ore in an open dish with proper\r\nreagents, and collecting all the volatile ingredients in the slag.\r\nCupellation, on the other hand, collects them in the bone ash, of\r\nwhich the cupel is composed.\r\n\r\nWhen silver must be separated from gold, it is sometimes convenient to\r\nincrease its proportion by the addition of some known weight of the\r\ninferior metal. After fusing, the globule is placed in nitric acid,\r\nand the silver parted from the gold, which may then be weighed. This\r\nresult subtracted from the weight of the original globule gives the\r\namount of silver.\r\n\r\nTo test an ore for gold, take a pound of it, crush in mortar and pass\r\nthrough a fine sieve. Take one-fourth ounce Troy of the powder. Place\r\nin scorifier with an equal amount of litharge. Cover with borax that\r\nhas been melted and powdered, and put the scorifier in the muffle of\r\nthe furnace. A blacksmith's forge might do at a pinch. Heat until the\r\nmass has become a fluid, possibly twenty or thirty minutes. Next pour\r\ninto the scorification mould, and, after the slag has set, remove it\r\nwith a hammer. Hammer the button into a cube and place it in the\r\ncupel, which must first have been thoroughly heated. Heat until all\r\nthe base metal has been absorbed by the cupel and the button has\r\n\"brightened,\" or flashed; when this occurs, remove the cupel to the\r\nfront of the muffle, cool, and remove the button with pincers. Weigh\r\nit, and you have the amount of gold and silver in 1/4-ounce Troy. A\r\nsimple sum in proportion gives the amount in a ton.\r\n\r\nAll ores containing sulphur, arsenic, antimony, or zinc, should be\r\nroasted.\r\n\r\nThere are three stages in the scorification process; roasting, fusion,\r\nand scorification. During the first, the heat should be moderate until\r\nfumes cease to be given off; during the second, the heat is raised and\r\na play of colors is seen on the surface of the lead; in the closing\r\nstage, the heat is lowered for a time until the slag covers the lead,\r\nwhen it is again raised for a short time and the scorifier removed.\r\nBrittle buttons may be due to arsenic, antimony, zinc or litharge, and\r\nmust be re-scorified before cupellation, with more lead.\r\n\r\nTake the cupel slowly from the fire to avoid \"spitting,\" by which\r\nportions of the buttons are lost. Watch closely for the brightening.\r\n\r\nSilver is volatile at a high heat, but when the muffle is almost\r\nwhite, the metal well fused and clean, the fumes rising slowly, and\r\nthe cupel a cherry red, all is going smoothly. If the fumes rise\r\nrapidly, the muffle is too hot. On the other hand, dense, falling\r\nfumes show the temperature is too low. Lead that is poor in silver\r\nstands the highest heat without vitiating the assay.\r\n\r\nWhen the material in the cupel \"freezes,\" i.e., the absorption by the\r\ncupel stops, reject the assay and try again, giving more heat or more\r\nlead.\r\n\r\nGold. Practically, the metal most prospectors seek is gold. It is so\r\nenormously valuable and constitutes so very small a percentage of any\r\nore, that care must be taken or it may escape detection and be lost.\r\nPanning is the miner's method. He crushes his ore thoroughly, and\r\nplaces it in the pan with water; then, with a motion easy to learn but\r\ndifficult to describe, he swirls the water around, allowing a little\r\nof it to escape at each revolution, carrying with it the rubbish,\r\nuntil finally he has a little black sand and perhaps a few grains of\r\nyellow substance, which is gold. Mica, or fool's gold, puzzles nobody\r\nbut the ignoramus. True, it looks like gold in certain positions and\r\nlights, but gold will beat out thin under the hammer, just as lead\r\nwould, while mica will break up into a floury powder. Mica is very\r\nlight, while gold is very heavy; so there is no excuse for confounding\r\nthe two. If an ore contains sulphurets and gold, the latter may be\r\ncoated with some sulphur or arsenic, which would prevent the gold from\r\namalgamating. The only remedy for this is roasting. No single acid\r\nwill dissolve gold, but a solution known as aqua regia, made up of\r\nthree parts of hydrochloric acid and one part of nitric acid,\r\ndissolves it. If to the solution so obtained you add some sulphate of\r\niron, you will get a precipitate which is metallic gold, although it\r\ndoes not look like it, as it is brown in color; but if you place this\r\nprecipitate in a crucible and heat, you will get a yellow bead of pure\r\ngold. Another test for gold is to take the solution as above obtained\r\nand add thereto a solution of chloride of tin, when you obtain a\r\npurple coloration that has been called the purple of Cassius.\r\n\r\nGold may be distinguished from all other metals by the three following\r\ntests: It is yellow; it may be flattened by the hammer; it is not\r\nacted upon by nitric acid.\r\n\r\nPure gold is soft, and the point of a knife will scratch it deeply.\r\nPounded in a mortar, the pulverized mineral should be passed through a\r\ncheese-cloth screen stretched over a loop of wood. If the course\r\ncontains much pyrite, it must be roasted before washing in the pan and\r\namalgamating. Sample well, weigh out two pounds, put it in a black\r\niron pan, with four ounces of mercury, four ounces of salt, four\r\nounces of soda and a half gallon of boiling water. Stir with a green\r\nstick, and agitate until the mercury has been able to reach all the\r\ngold. Pan off into another dish so as to lose no mercury, squeeze the\r\namalgam through chamois leather or new calico previously wetted. The\r\npill of hard amalgam may be placed on a shovel over the fire or in a\r\nclay tobacco pipe and retorted.\r\n\r\nGold is readily acted upon by the mixture of nitric and hydrochloric\r\nacids known as aqua regia, or by any solution producing chlorine. Some\r\nof the mixtures which attack it are bisulphate of soda, nitrate of\r\nsoda and common salt, hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate, and\r\nbleaching powder. The action is more rapid in hot than in cold\r\nsolutions, and impure gold is more easily dissolved than pure.\r\n\r\nMercury dissolves gold rapidly at ordinary temperatures, the amalgam\r\nbeing solid, pasty or liquid. Gold rubbed with mercury is immediately\r\npenetrated by it. An amalgam containing 90 per cent. of mercury is\r\nliquid; 87.5 per cent., pasty; 85 per cent., crystalline. These\r\namalgams heated gradually to a bright red heat lose all their mercury,\r\nand hardly any gold. About one-tenth of 1 per cent. of mercury remains\r\nin the gold until it is refined by melting.\r\n\r\nThe veins from which the gold of the world is won do not, on an\r\naverage, hold the precious metal in greater proportion than one part\r\nof gold in 70,000 parts of veinstone. Under favorable conditions a\r\nproportion not one-fifth as rich as this, may yield a rich return. In\r\nhydraulic mining on a large scale, one part of gold in 15,000,000\r\nparts of gravel has paid a dividend.\r\n\r\nA test known as Darton's is believed to be a valuable means of\r\ndetecting minute quantities of gold in rocks, ore tailings, etc.\r\n\r\n\"Small parts are chipped from all the sides of a mass of rock,\r\namounting in all to about 1/4 ounce. This is powdered in a steel\r\nmortar and well mixed. About half is placed in a capacious test tube,\r\nand then the tube is partly filled with a solution made by dissolving\r\n20 gr. of iodine and 30 gr. of iodide of potassium, in about 1-1/2\r\nounces water. The mixture thus formed is shaken and warmed. After all\r\nparticles have subsided, dip a piece of fine white filter paper in it;\r\nallow it to remain for a moment; then let it drain, and dry it over\r\nthe spirit lamp. It is next placed upon a piece of platinum foil held\r\nin a pincers, and heated to redness over the flame. The paper is\r\nspeedily consumed; and after again heating to burn off all carbon, it\r\nis allowed to cool and is then examined. If at all purple, gold is\r\npresent in the ore, and the relative amount may be approximately\r\ndeduced. This method takes little time, and is trustworthy.\"\r\n\r\nBlack sand, which is iron, often with some platinum and iridium,\r\nsometimes interferes with the result of a gold assay. Attwood\r\nrecommends the following method as applicable to such a case:\r\n\r\n\"Take 100 to 1000 grains and attack with aqua regia in a flask; cool\r\nfor about thirty minutes or more; dilute with water and filter. If\r\ngold is present, it will now be held in solution in the filtrate.\r\nRemove the filter and evaporate the filtrates to dryness; then add a\r\nlittle hydrochloric acid, evaporate and re-dissolve the dry salt in\r\nwarm water; add to the solution so formed proto-sulphate of iron;\r\nwhich will throw down the gold in the form of a fine, dark\r\nprecipitate. The precipitate is seldom fine, being mixed with oxides\r\nof iron, and must now be dried in the filter paper, and both burned\r\nover the lamp in a porcelain dish. Then mix the dried precipitate with\r\nthree times its weight of lead; fuse, scorify and cupel. In case\r\nplatinum, iridium, etc., are found associated with the gold, an extra\r\namount of fine silver should be added before cupellation, and the gold\r\nbutton will be found pure.\"\r\n\r\nIn one of his reports the State Mineralogist of California gives a\r\nmost lucid description of a mechanical assay of gold-bearing sands,\r\nstamped ore, etc., etc. He states:\r\n\r\n\"It must be understood that this is only a working test. It does not\r\ngive all the gold in the rock, as shown by a careful fire assay, but\r\nwhat is of equal importance to the mine-owner, mill-man, and practical\r\nminer, it gives what he can reasonably expect to save in a good quartz\r\nmill. It is really milling on a small scale. It is generally very\r\ncorrect and reliable, if a quantity of material be sampled. The only\r\noperation which requires much skill is the washing, generally well\r\nunderstood by those who are most likely to avail themselves of the\r\ninstructions. These rules apply equally to placer gravels. Take a\r\nquantity of the ore--the larger the better--and break it into\r\negg-sized pieces. Spread on a good floor, and with a shovel mix very\r\nthoroughly; then shovel into three piles, placing one shovelful upon\r\neach in succession until all is disposed of. Two of the piles may then\r\nbe put into bags. The remaining pile is spread on the floor, mixed as\r\nbefore, and shovelled in the same manner into three piles. This is\r\nrepeated according to the quantity sampled, until the last pile does\r\nnot contain more than 30 pounds of ore. As the quantity on the floor\r\nbecomes smaller, the lumps must be broken finer until at last they\r\nshould not exceed one inch in diameter. The remainder is reduced by a\r\nhammer and iron ring to the size of peas. The whole 30 pounds is then\r\nspread out, and after careful mixing portions are lifted with a flat\r\nknife, taking up the fine dust with the larger fragments, until about\r\n10 pounds have been gathered. This quantity is then ground down fine\r\nwith the muller, and passed through a 40-mesh sieve. If the rock is\r\nrich, the last portion will be found to contain some free gold in\r\nflattened discs, which will not pass this sieve. These must be placed\r\nwith the pulverized ore, and the whole thoroughly mixed, if the\r\nquantity is small, but if large must be treated separately, and the\r\namount of gold allotted to the whole 10 pounds and noted when the\r\nfinal calculation is made.\r\n\r\n\"From the thoroughly-mixed sample, two kilogrammes (2000 grammes) must\r\nbe carefully laid out. This is placed in a pan or, better, in a batea,\r\nand carefully washed down until the gold begins to appear. Clean water\r\nis then used, and, when the pan and the small residue are cleaned,\r\nmost of the water is poured off and a globule of pure mercury (which\r\nmust be free from gold) is dropped in, a piece of cyanide of potassium\r\nbeing added with it. As the cyanide dissolves, a rotary motion is\r\ngiven the dish, best done by holding the arms stiff and moving the\r\nbody. As the mercury rolls over and ploughs through the sand, under\r\nthe influence of the cyanide it will collect together all the\r\nparticles of free gold. When it is certain that all is collected, the\r\nmercury may be carefully transferred to a small porcelain cup or test\r\ntube, and boiled with strong nitric acid, which must be pure. When the\r\nmercury is all dissolved the acid is poured off, more nitric acid\r\napplied cold, and rejected, and the gold is then washed with distilled\r\nwater and dried.\r\n\r\n\"The object of washing with acid the second time is to remove any\r\nnitrate of mercury which might remain with the gold, and which is\r\nimmediately precipitated if water is first used.\r\n\r\n\"The resulting gold is not pure, but has the composition of the\r\nnatural alloy. Before accurate calculations of value are possible, the\r\ngold must be obtained pure and weighed carefully. To purify the gold\r\nit should be melted with silver, rolled out or hammered thin, boiled\r\ntwice with nitric acid, washed, dried, and heated to redness.\r\n\r\n\"The method of calculating this assay is simple. It will be observed\r\nthat 2000 grammes represent a ton of 2000 pounds; then each gramme\r\nwill be the equivalent of one pound avoirdupois, or one 2000th part of\r\nthe whole, and the decimals of a gramme to the decimals of a pound.\r\nSuppose the ore yielded by the assay just described, fine gold\r\nweighing .072 gramme, it must be quite evident that a ton of the ore\r\nwould yield the same decimal of one pound. Now one pound of gold is\r\nworth $301.46, and it is only necessary to multiply this value by the\r\nweight of gold obtained in grammes and decimals to find the value of\r\nthe gold in a ton of ore--$301.46 × .072--$21.70. The cyanide solution\r\nshould be kept rather weak, as gold is slightly soluble in strong\r\nsolutions of cyanide of potassium. Cyanide is a deadly poison.\"\r\n\r\nTouchstones are useful in deciding the probable value of gold alloys.\r\nSeveral pieces of the metal under examination are cut with a cold\r\nchisel, and the fresh edges drawn over the touchstone. These streaks\r\nare touched with nitric acid on a glass rod. Should no reaction\r\nfollow, the gold is at least 640 fine. Wipe the stone with soft linen\r\nand try with test acid, made by mixing 98 parts of chemically pure\r\nnitric acid with two parts of hydrochloric acid, adding 25 parts\r\ndistilled water by measure. If this has no effect, take a touch needle\r\nmarked 700, and make a similar streak on the stone samples. Compare,\r\nand, if necessary, continue with the other needles, using a higher\r\nnumber each time. An approximate estimate of the sample will soon be\r\nobtained. Should the gold seem poorer than 640 fine, try with the\r\ncopper or silver needle. Practice and a good eye soon make this method\r\nvery certain in its results.\r\n\r\nRetorted amalgam is likely to contain mercury. To test for it, put a\r\nsmall fragment into a closed glass tube, taking care that it falls\r\nquite to the bottom. Heat the gold over a spirit lamp, and a deposit\r\nof mercury will soon be seen upon the colder sides of the tube above\r\nthe bottom. The tube may be broken and the mercury collected into a\r\nglobule under water.\r\n\r\nIn mining regions gold dust passes current as coin, according to what\r\nis supposed to be its value. Occasionally counterfeit dust is offered.\r\nThe readiest means by which it may be detected are as follows: The\r\ndust from any one district is always much alike, and any unusual\r\nappearance should create suspicion. Try any doubtful pieces on a small\r\nanvil, remembering that gold is extremely malleable. Test some of the\r\ngold with nitric acid; effervescence or evolution of red fumes, or\r\ncoloration of the acid prove impurities to be present. Place two\r\nwatch-glasses (most useful in chemical tests) on paper; the one on a\r\nwhite sheet, the other on a black, and with a glass rod convey a few\r\ndrops of nitric acid from the dish to each. To the glass on white\r\npaper add a drop or two of ammonia; a blue color would indicate\r\ncopper. To the other add hydrochloric acid; should a white precipitate\r\nform, it proves silver. If no action is noticed, even after heating\r\nthe dish, the dust is genuine. As \"dust\" is sometimes merely copper\r\ncoated with gold, the better plan is to cut all the larger grains in\r\ntwo, so that the acid may attack the copper should it be present.\r\n\r\nCopper. Copper is a very easy mineral to test for. First crush the ore\r\nand dissolve it in nitric acid by heating. Then dilute with some\r\nwater, and add ammonia. The solution should turn dark blue. The\r\ncarbonate ores of copper do not extend deep in the mine. Their places\r\nare taken by copper pyrites. Sulphide ores are usually difficult to\r\ntreat, and when they are to be tested it is better to roast them\r\nbefore trying the tests for color.\r\n\r\nTest for copper may also be made as follows:\r\n\r\nThe sample must be pulverized. Take an ounce of the powder, and place\r\nin a porcelain cup. Add forty drops of nitric acid, twenty drops of\r\nsulphuric acid and twelve drops of hydrochloric acid. Boil over the\r\nspirit lamp until white fumes arise. When cool, mix with a little\r\nwater. Filter and add a nail or two to the liquid. The copper will be\r\nprecipitated, and may be gathered up and weighed. The amount of copper\r\nin the sample multiplied by 32,000 will be the copper in a ton of the\r\nore.\r\n\r\nShould copper be suspected, roast the powdered ore and mix with an\r\nequal quantity of salt and candle grease or other fat; then cast into\r\nthe fire, and the characteristic flame of copper--first blue and then\r\ngreen--will appear. This test is better made at night.\r\n\r\nCoal. Coal is often more valuable than gold, and the prospector should\r\nbe prepared to estimate the value of any seams he may come across\r\nduring his travels. The following is a very rough but wonderfully\r\neffective test for coal. Take a clay pipe, pulverize your sample,\r\nweigh off twenty pennyweights, and place it in the bowl of the pipe.\r\nMake a cover with some damp clay. Dry thoroughly, and put the bowl\r\nupside down over a flame. The gas in the coal will come out through\r\nthe stem, and may be lit with a match. Let the pipe cool after the gas\r\nhas all escaped, break off the covering of clay, and if the coal was\r\nadapted for coke the result will be a lump of that substance in the\r\nbowl. Weigh this. The difference in weight between the coke and the\r\ntwenty pennyweights of coal that were placed in the bowl will\r\nrepresent the combustible matter forced out by the heat. Now take this\r\ncoke and burn it on a porcelain dish over the lamp. You will have more\r\nor less ash left, and the difference in weight of the ash and the coke\r\nwill be the amount of fixed carbon in the coal. Your test is complete,\r\nand it need not have cost you even the pipe. Sulphur is a detriment to\r\ncoal, and if you notice much of it in the escaping fumes, you may be\r\nsure your sample is not worth much.\r\n\r\nMercury. Cinnabar, the common ore of mercury, is a sulphide. Scratch\r\nit with a knife, and the streak will be bright crimson. Dissolve the\r\nore in nitric acid, add a solution of caustic potash, and you have a\r\nyellow precipitate. A very pretty test is to place the ore pulverized\r\nin a glass tube with some chloride of lime; close the top of the tube,\r\nand place a smaller one therein, so bent that it will pass into a\r\nbasin of water; heat the bottom of the tube containing the ore and\r\nlime, keeping the upper part and the small tube cold with wet rags,\r\nand you will have a deposit of quicksilver in the basin.\r\n\r\nSilver. Silver ore may be detected by dissolving a small quantity in a\r\ntest tube with a few drops of nitric acid. Boil until all the red\r\nfumes disappear. Let the solution cool, and add a little water. Filter\r\nthe whole, and add a few drops of muriatic acid, which will\r\nprecipitate the white chloride of silver. Dissolve this precipitate\r\nwith ammonia; then add nitric acid once more. Exposed to the light,\r\nthe precipitate soon shows a violet tint. Pure silver is the brightest\r\nof metals, of a brilliant white hue, with rich luster. To detect\r\nchloride of silver in a pulp, rub harshly with a clean, bright and wet\r\ncopper cartridge or coin, and if there be silver in the pulp the\r\ncopper will be coated with it. Graphite will also whiten copper, but\r\nthe film is easily rubbed off.\r\n\r\nNickel. Nickel may be determined as follows: A little of the powdered\r\nore taken up on the point of a penknife, and dissolved in a mixture of\r\nten drops of nitric and five drops of muriatic acid, should be boiled\r\nover a lamp for a few minutes, and ten or twelve drops of water added.\r\nA small quantity of ferrocyanide of potash will throw down a\r\nwhitish-green precipitate, indicating nickel.\r\n\r\nPlatinum. Platinum is a most refractory metal to treat, as it must be\r\nboiled for at least two hours in the mixture of muriatic and nitric\r\nacid, known as aqua regia. A small amount of alcohol is to be added to\r\nthe solution, and the latter filtered. The platinum is precipitated\r\nwith ammonia chloride.\r\n\r\nManganese. Manganese may be proved as follows: A few grains of\r\npowdered ore are placed in a test-tube, with three or four drops of\r\nsulphuric acid. Two or three grains of granulated lead or litharge\r\nbeing dropped in, the color will become pink should manganese be in\r\nthe ore.\r\n\r\nA preliminary examination of a mineral may be made with a pocket lens\r\nand a penknife. With the first, any conspicuous constituents may be\r\nrecognized, while a scratch with the point of the latter will give an\r\nidea as to the softness or hardness of the mineral. Should much quartz\r\n(silica) be present, a sharp blow with the steel will cause sparks.\r\n\r\nThe next test should be with some ore powdered and held over a spirit\r\nflame. A drop or two of water and a drop of sulpho-cyanide of potash\r\nwill reveal iron, should such be present, by a deep red coloration.\r\n\r\nTo another portion add one drop of hydrochloric acid, and a dense,\r\ncurdy precipitate will indicate silver, if there be any.\r\n\r\nAdded to the same original nitric acid solution, several drops of\r\nammonia water would detect copper by a blue color.\r\n\r\nAntimony, tin, aluminum, zinc, cobalt and nickel, uranium and titanium\r\nare best shown by the blowpipe.\r\n\r\nCarbonates, that is those minerals that contain carbon and oxygen in\r\naddition to the metal, effervesce when brought into contact with\r\nhydrochloric acid. Some sandstones have a small amount of lime\r\ncarbonate, and must be tried under the lens, as the bubbles are\r\nmicroscopic. These tests are extremely useful, but by no means\r\ninfallible, owing to so few ores being pure.\r\n\r\nWhen the explorer wishes to know all the constituents of the ore he\r\nhas found, he must analyze it. An analysis gives every substance in\r\nthe ore. Such examinations may be either by the \"dry\" or \"wet\"\r\nmethods, though usually the term \"analysis\" is restricted to the\r\nlatter, and \"fire assay\" is used to describe the former. The wet assay\r\nfor silver, lead or mercury is effected as follows:\r\n\r\nDrop a little powdered ore in a test tube; add nitric acid; dilute\r\nwith 1/8 water; warm gently over the spirit lamp. It may dissolve or\r\nit may not. In the latter case, add four times as much hydrochloric\r\nacid. Should all these attempts fail, a fresh sample must be taken,\r\nand equal parts of sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate added, and\r\nthe whole strongly heated in a platinum crucible. The contents, after\r\ncooling, is dissolved in dilute nitric acid.\r\n\r\nIn any case the assay will now be dissolved, and will be in the\r\nsolution. Filter. Pour ten drops into a test tube; add three or four\r\ndrops of hydrochloric acid. A precipitate appears. It may be silver,\r\nlead or mercury. If silver, it grows dark violet after exposure to\r\nsunlight, or 30 or 40 drops of ammonia dissolves it in a few moments.\r\nShould it not dissolve, it is lead or mercury. Test for lead by\r\nfiltering, and heating some of the precipitate on charcoal before the\r\nblow-pipe. A bead and yellow incrustation indicate lead. Should none\r\nof these things happen, then the metal is mercury. Filter; place in\r\nglass tubes; heat gently, and a mirror of quicksilver will appear on\r\nthe sides of the glass.\r\n\r\nThis is as far as the prospector, without the various reagents and\r\nchemicals that the analyst has always at hand, will be able to go.\r\nMore complex treatment must be reserved until a return to\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nBLOW-PIPE TESTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLOW-PIPE.]\r\n\r\nAs a means of readily detecting the presence of minerals in their ores\r\nthe blow-pipe, in the hands of a skillful operator, is unrivaled. Nor\r\nis this skill at all hard to come by; two or three weeks' patient\r\nstudy under a good master should teach a great deal, and subsequently\r\nproficiency would come by practice in the field. Unfortunately, some\r\nvery clever men have become so enthusiastic as to blow-pipe work that\r\nthey have devised methods by which the amount of metal in an ore as\r\nwell as its nature may be determined, but in so doing have so enlarged\r\nthe amount of apparatus, and complicated the tests so seriously that\r\nthe simplicity of the blow-pipe outfit is in danger of being lost, and\r\nits chief advantage of being forgotten; for there are many better ways\r\nof determining the value of an ore. A good assay or, better still, a\r\nmill run, is worth incomparably more than any quantitative blow-pipe\r\ntest, even when conducted by a Plattner.\r\n\r\nThe chemical blow-pipe is made of brass or German silver, with\r\nplatinum tip.\r\n\r\nThe best fuel, taking everything into consideration, is a paraffin\r\ncandle in cold climates, and a stearine candle in hot ones. Tallow may\r\ndo in an emergency, but it requires too much snuffing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REDUCING FLAME.]\r\n\r\nThe blow-pipe can produce two flames. The one known as the reducing\r\nflame, and generally printed as R.F.; and the oxidizing flame,\r\nrepresented by the initials O.F. In the first the substance under\r\nexamination is heated out of contact with the air and parts with its\r\noxygen. In the second, it is heated in the air and absorbs oxygen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OXIDIZING FLAME.]\r\n\r\nWell-burnt pine or willow charcoal in slabs 3 inches by 1-3/4 inches\r\nis the material upon which the mineral to be tested is placed. A small\r\nshallow depression is scraped out of one side of it and the assay\r\nplaced therein.\r\n\r\nPlatinum wire, some 3 inches long, conveniently fused into a piece of\r\nglass tube as a handle, is used to test the coloration of minerals in\r\nthe flame. This should be cleaned occasionally in dilute sulphuric\r\nacid and then washed in water.\r\n\r\nA small pair of forceps with platinum points serve a great variety of\r\npurposes, but the beginner must be careful not to heat metallic\r\nsubstances in them to a red heat, as he may thereby cause an alloy of\r\nthe metal with the platinum and spoil them for future use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AGATE MORTAR.]\r\n\r\nGlass tubing one-twelfth to one-quarter inch in diameter and from four\r\nto six inches in length is used for a variety of purposes. From this\r\nmaterial what are known as closed tubes may be made by heating a piece\r\nof the tubing at or about its center over a spirit lamp, and, when the\r\nglass has fused, pulling it apart. These closed tubes are used in\r\nheating substances out of contact with the air.\r\n\r\nA small agate mortar is indispensable. It must be used for grinding\r\nsubstances softer than itself to a powder, but it will break if rapped\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\nA small jeweler's hammer is used to flatten metallic globules upon any\r\nhard surface A regular blow-pipe outfit would include a small anvil\r\nfor this purpose, but it is hardly necessary, as any iron or steel\r\nsurface will do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAGNET.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LENS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEST OF TEST TUBES.]\r\n\r\nA magnet will detect the presence of any magnetic mineral, especially\r\nif it is reduced to powder and the test made under water.\r\n\r\nTwo small files, one three-cornered and the other rat-tailed, must be\r\nincluded in the list of requisites. By means of the former, glass\r\ntubing may be notched and pulled or pushed apart, and the latter is\r\nnecessary in fitting glass tubing to the cork of wash-bottles and\r\nother apparatus.\r\n\r\nA good lens is indispensable. That known as the Coddington is as good\r\nas any.\r\n\r\nA dozen test tubes of hard glass, with stand, in small and medium\r\nsizes, should not be forgotten.\r\n\r\nA glass funnel 2-1/2 inches in diameter is requisite in filtering. The\r\ncircular filter papers are folded in four and placed in the funnel,\r\npoint down, three thicknesses of the paper being on one side of the\r\nfunnel and one thickness on the other.\r\n\r\nA wash-bottle is made from a flask into which a sound cork has been\r\nplaced with holes in it for two pieces of glass tubing. The one serves\r\nas a mouth-piece into which the operator blows, while the other,\r\nreaching almost to the bottom of the bottle and ending in a spout\r\noutside the cork, permits a stream of water to be forced out of the\r\nbottle when it is blown into.\r\n\r\nA few glass rods in short lengths do for stirrers. A little ingenuity\r\nis better than much apparatus.\r\n\r\nOf reagents, all those to be found in a well-appointed laboratory may\r\noccasionally be of service, but the rough and ready prospector can get\r\nalong fairly well with the following: Carbonate of soda, borax,\r\nmicrocosmic salt, cobalt solution, cyanide of potassium, lead\r\ngranulated, bone ash, test papers of blue litmus and turmeric, the\r\nformer for proving the presence of acid in a solution and the latter\r\nthat of an alkali.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are all dry reagents. Among the wet reagents are:\r\nWater--clean rainwater--or, better still, distilled water;\r\nhydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, ammonia, nitrate of\r\ncobalt.\r\n\r\nHeating a mineral with carbonate of soda on charcoal is accomplished\r\nas follows: The pulverized mineral, intimately mixed with three times\r\nits bulk of carbonate of soda, is placed in the cavity on the coal.\r\nTin ore, which is very difficult to reduce, should have a fragment of\r\ncyanide of potassium placed upon it after it has been heated for a few\r\nseconds, and the flame is then reapplied. A globule of metal should\r\nresult, and perhaps an incrustation on the coal. The reaction is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n      Metal.         Globule.              Incrustation.\r\n    Gold.       Yellow, malleable.      None.\r\n    Silver.     White, malleable.       None.\r\n    Copper.     Red, malleable.         None.\r\n    Lead.       White, malleable.       Red when hot, yellow\r\n                                          when cold.\r\n    Bismuth.    White, brittle.         Red when hot, yellow\r\n                                          when cold.\r\n    Zinc.       None.                   Yellow when hot, white\r\n                                          when cold.\r\n    Antimony.   White, brittle, fumes.  White.\r\n\r\nA small loop is made at the end of the platinum wire, and it is heated\r\nand dipped in borax; heated again, then touched while hot to the\r\npowdered mineral and heated once more. The following colors are\r\nobtained:\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOR OF BEAD.\r\n\r\n          O.F.                            R.F.          Metal.\r\n    Red or yellow, hot.              Bottle-green.     Iron.\r\n    Yellow or colorless, cold.\r\n    Blue, hot or cold.               Blue.             Cobalt.\r\n    Green, hot; blue, cold.          Red.              Copper.\r\n    Amethyst.                        Colorless.        Manganese.\r\n    Green.                           Green.            Chromium.\r\n    Violet, hot; red-brown, cold.    Gray.             Nickel.\r\n\r\nThe substance to be tested is generally powdered and moistened, placed\r\nin the cavity and covered or not as circumstances may demand, with a\r\npinch of carbonate of soda or other suitable reagent. The following\r\nresults may be obtained:\r\n\r\nAntimony. Place the mineral in the cavity with a little of carbonate\r\nof soda, and blow upon it with the inner or oxidizing flame. This is\r\nformed by inserting the blow-pipe an eighth of an inch into the flame\r\nand blowing steadily. A white incrustation on the coal, and a brittle\r\nbutton of antimony should be the result.\r\n\r\nLead. Treat the suspected lead ore the same way, and you will get a\r\nyellow incrustation on the coal and a button of malleable lead.\r\n\r\nZinc. Proceed as above, and after blowing for a few seconds moisten\r\nthe incrustation with a drop of nitrate of cobalt. Heat once more, but\r\nthis time use the outer or reducing flame, which is produced by\r\nkeeping the point of the blow-pipe a little outside the flame and\r\nblowing more gently than before, so that the whole flame playing upon\r\nthe coal may be yellow in color. A green incrustation will be an\r\nevidence of zinc.\r\n\r\nCopper. As usual, mix the ore and the soda into a paste and fuse it\r\nwith the oxidizing flame. Dig the mass out of the charcoal with the\r\npoint of a knife and rub it in the mortar with water. Now decant into\r\na test tube, and, allowing the sediment to settle, pour off the water.\r\nIf there was copper in the ore, red scales will be found in the test\r\ntube.\r\n\r\nArsenic. Heat in the inner flame for a second or two, and if the ore\r\ncontains arsenic you will notice an odor of garlic.\r\n\r\nTin. This is a very difficult ore to reduce, but the addition of a\r\nlittle cyanide of potash to the powdered ore will make it easier.\r\nFuse, after moistening on the charcoal, in the oxidizing flame, and\r\nyou will probably obtain small globules of tin.\r\n\r\nSilver. Make a paste of the ore with carbonate of soda; add a small\r\npiece of lead and fuse into a button. Make a second paste of bone ash\r\nand water, and after you have dried it with a gentle flame place the\r\nbutton of silver and lead on the bone ash, and turn on the oxidizing\r\nflame. The lead will disappear, leaving a silver globule. Should it\r\nnot be pure white, but more or less tinged with yellow, it probably\r\ncontains gold; and if the button be dissolved in nitric acid, whatever\r\nremains behind is gold.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is desirable to determine whether tellurium is present in\r\nan ore. This is very easy to find out. All that is required is a\r\nblow-pipe, alcohol lamp and a porcelain dish. Break off a small piece\r\nof the ore, place it in the dish previously warmed, blow upon the ore\r\nwith the blow-pipe until it is oxidized, then drop a little sulphuric\r\nacid on the ore and dish. If tellurium be present, carmine and purple\r\ncolors on the assay will proclaim the fact.\r\n\r\nBismuth ores are very heavy; usually they have more or less antimony\r\nassociated with them, which is a drawback, as the separation is an\r\nexpensive matter and the returns are less than they would be from a\r\nlow grade pure ore. In testing for this metal, dissolve a crushed\r\nsample in nitric acid and then add potash in excess. If the ore is one\r\ncontaining bismuth, you should have a white precipitate; if it\r\ncontains cobalt, you will get a bluish-green coloration. Bismuth is\r\nworth about fifty cents a pound if pure and free from antimony.\r\n\r\nGalena is often mistaken for other ores, specular iron ore for\r\ninstance. If the ore be crushed and heated in nitric acid until\r\ndissolved, some water added, and an addition made to the solution of a\r\nfew drops of ferrocyanide of potassium, a dark blood-red precipitate\r\nis thrown down. If the ore were galena, there would be no coloration.\r\nThe so-called steel galena which carries a little zinc is generally\r\nricher in silver than the ordinary cube galena, though the reverse is\r\nsometimes the case.\r\n\r\nIf lead ore be dissolved in nitric acid, the solution diluted, and\r\nsome hydrochloric acid added, a white precipitate is thrown down. Add\r\nammonia and the precipitate remains unaltered.\r\n\r\nThe blow-pipe operator has to learn to breathe and blow at the same\r\ntime; the breathing he does through the nostrils, the blowing is\r\nproduced by the natural tendency of the cheeks to collapse when\r\ndistended with air. A skillful operator can blow for many minutes at a\r\ntime without the slightest fatigue.\r\n\r\nTo identify cinnabar, the ore from which quicksilver is obtained, make\r\na paste of the substance in powder and carbonate of soda. Heat in the\r\nopen tube, and a globule of mercury will result.\r\n\r\nSulphur turns silver black. Make a paste with carbonate of soda, heat\r\non the charcoal, and removing the mass with the point of a knife lay\r\nit on a silver coin and moisten. A black sulphide of silver should\r\nshow quickly on the coin if sulphur is present. Magnesia gives a faint\r\npink color when heated and treated with nitrate of cobalt on coal.\r\nAlumina under the same circumstances give a blue color.\r\n\r\nRoasting is an oxidizing process, the substance being heated in air,\r\nso that it may absorb oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe test by reduction with soda on coal in the R.F. is particularly\r\nvaluable in the case of copper ore, as little as 1 per cent. being\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nECONOMIC ORES AND MINERALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAluminum is derived from two ores, cryolite and bauxite. This metal\r\nhas made rapid strides into favor during the past half-dozen years.\r\nAlthough known since 1827, it remained a rare substance in the\r\nmetallic form, though it is the most abundant of any of the metals\r\nin its ore. In ordinary clay there is an inexhaustible source of\r\naluminum. But the ores that yield the metal cheaply are few. Until\r\nrecently, cryolite, found abundantly in Greenland, was the chief\r\nsource of the metal, but now bauxite is used in its place. Bauxite is\r\na limonite iron ore in which a part of the iron has been replaced by\r\naluminum. It is found in Alabama, Georgia and Arkansas, as well as in\r\nEurope. Aluminum is white, and very light in weight. It does not\r\ntarnish easily.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of these ores is:\r\n\r\n                                             Aluminum.\r\n    Cryolite, Al{2}F{6}.6NaF               12.8 per cent.\r\n    Bauxite, Al{2}O{3}.3H{2}O              73.9 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 the production of this metal in the United States was 900,000\r\npounds. In 1899 it rose to 6,500,000 pounds. The only firm producing\r\naluminum is the Pittsburg Manufacturing Company of Buffalo, N.Y., who\r\nreduce the metal from bauxite, which they obtain in the southern\r\nstates. One of the latest uses for this metal is for gold miners'\r\npans. The French seem to keep ahead of the rest of the world in\r\nfinding new uses for aluminum.\r\n\r\nMost of the supply of cryolite comes from Greenland, where it occurs\r\nin veins running through gneiss rocks. Glass-makers use it and pay\r\ngood prices for it. Lately makers of aluminum also buy it, as it\r\ncontains 13 per cent. of that metal.\r\n\r\nA new aluminum-bearing mineral, discovered in New Mexico and in Ohio,\r\nis called native alum. It gives 50.16 per cent. alumina, and may be\r\ntreated by solution in warm water, filtration, evaporation and\r\nroasting. No estimate has yet been made of the amount available.\r\n\r\nAs bauxite promises to be in greater demand in the future than in the\r\npresent, owing to the ever-increasing demand for aluminum, the\r\nprospector will do well to make himself thoroughly familiar with its\r\nappearance. It is creamy white when free from iron, and the grains are\r\nlike little peas, or pisolitic. It contains water, aluminum, silica,\r\nand generally iron. The French beds near the town of Baux are 30 miles\r\nlong and 40 feet thick. In the United States, beds have been found in\r\nAlabama, Georgia and Arkansas. The Georgia beds are turning out\r\nthree-fifths of the bauxite produced in America. The ore is in beds\r\nand pockets, and enough has been prospected to assure a supply for\r\nsome years to come, unless the demand should grow very decidedly, in\r\nwhich case a scarcity might soon be felt. The American ore is easier\r\nto work than the French, and manufacturers prefer it to any they can\r\nimport, even though the cost is higher and the percentage of aluminum\r\nsmaller. The Arkansas deposits are as thick as the French, and only\r\n300 feet above the level of the tide. Imported bauxite cost $5 to $7 a\r\nton in New York City. American ore costs $5 to $12 a long ton. Best\r\nselected Georgia brings $10.\r\n\r\nShould the deposits of bauxite give out, the manufacturers of aluminum\r\nwould probably fall back on cryolite. At Tvigtuk, on the west coast of\r\nGreenland, it exists, as a very heavy vein, in gneiss. It is\r\nsemitransparent, and snow-white. Impurities may stain it yellow or red\r\nor even black. Its specific gravity is 2.95, and its hardness 2.5 to\r\n3. It is fusible in the flame of a candle, and yields hydrofluoric\r\nacid if treated with sulphuric acid. It is still used for making soda\r\nand aluminum salts, and an imitation porcelain. It is also in general\r\nuse as a flux.\r\n\r\nAmber. This is a fossil resin, or gum, and may often be found in\r\nlignite beds. Recent discoveries have been made on the coast of\r\nBritish Columbia that are expected to supply the world. All\r\npipe-smokers know it.\r\n\r\nAntimony. The commercial ore of this metal is the sulphide known as\r\nstibnite, or gray antimony. Its composition when pure is 72 per cent.\r\nantimony and 28 per cent. sulphur. Hardness is 2; gravity, 4.5;\r\nluster, metallic; opaque; gray; cleavage, perfect. Fracture,\r\nconchoidal. Texture, granular to massive. The ore tarnishes quickly,\r\nis easily melted, or dissolved in hydrochloric acid. The associated\r\nminerals are generally the ores of lead, zinc, and carbonate of iron.\r\nBaryta may be the gangue or veinstone. Antimony is worth from 10 to 15\r\ncents a pound.\r\n\r\nAlthough antimony occurs in many minerals, the only commercial source\r\nis the sulphide, stibnite. Antimony is used as an alloy in type metal,\r\npewter, and babbitt metals. It is injurious to copper, even one-tenth\r\nof one per cent. reducing the value of that metal very considerably.\r\nThe price varies greatly, being now about 10 cents a pound.\r\n\r\nThe composition of stibnite is:\r\n\r\n                                         Antimony.\r\n    Stibnite, Sb{2}S{3}                71.8 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe production of antimony in this country is not very large. The\r\noutput of 1899 was but 1,250 tons, valued at $241,250. The ore is\r\nworth from $40 to $50 a ton delivered at Staten Island, N.Y.\r\n\r\nApatite suffered in demand when the cheap phosphates of South Carolina\r\nwere discovered, and these in turn are being ousted from the markets\r\nof the world by Thomas slag, an artificial phosphate, and by the\r\neasily-mined natural phosphates of Algeria. The price varies with the\r\nquality of the rock, from $1.75 to $11 per ton, averaging in 1899,\r\n$3.86.\r\n\r\nApatite is a phosphate of lime, containing 43 per cent. of phosphoric\r\nacid. It occurs in the old crystalline and primary rocks of Canada,\r\nbut although still of some value it has yielded the position it once\r\noccupied to the Carolina phosphate deposits, which, although not so\r\nrich in acid, are softer, and less expensive to utilize. Apatite is\r\ndoubtless derived from the remains of animals or fishes that lived in\r\nthe distant past. The colors are often beautiful--green, pink, gray,\r\netc.--but the sheen is always white. Hardness of 4.8. Specific\r\ngravity, 3.1.\r\n\r\nAsbestos. This fibrous silicate of magnesia and lime is to be looked\r\nfor among primary rocks near serpentine dike. The fibers of this\r\nmaterial may be woven into cloth that will be fire-proof. It is of\r\nconsiderable, though fluctuating, value.\r\n\r\nThe demand for this material is likely to increase, though at present\r\nthe supply is fully equal to demand. It is being used in Germany to\r\nmake fire-proof paper, and in Quebec to make asbestos plaster for\r\ncovering wood-work. It is generally quarried in open pits, the rock\r\nbeing crushed in a rock-breaker, and the fiber freed from adhering\r\nparticles of rock and dust. It is then sorted, the longest fibers\r\ngoing into the first quality heap. The production in 1899 in the\r\nUnited States was 912 tons, value $13,860; in Canada, 23,266 tons,\r\nvalue $598,736.\r\n\r\nBorax. This mineral is borate of soda. Its composition is: 37 per\r\ncent. boric acid, 16 per cent. soda, and 47 per cent. water. Its\r\ngravity is 1.7. Hardness, 2.3. It is white, and has a sweetish taste.\r\nBorax is valuable, but occurring as it does as an incrustation upon\r\nthe ground over large areas, a detailed description would be\r\nsuperfluous, as the explorer will surely recognize it should he find\r\nit.\r\n\r\nClay. A good bed of clay may be of value in an accessible region.\r\nBrick-clay contains silica, alumina, iron, etc. Potters' clay is made\r\nby suspending ordinary brick-clay in water, and running off the water\r\nand fine particles suspended therein. These are allowed to settle,\r\nand, when dry, are fine potters' clay. The better the clay, the larger\r\nthe percentage of potters' clay. Fire-clay should contain 60 per cent.\r\nof silica, and 30 per cent. of alumina. Mixed with sand and burnt into\r\nbricks, it will resist great heat. Light-colored clays are preferable\r\nfor this purpose, as iron is prejudicial to a good fire-brick. Kaolin\r\nis the finest porcelain clay, and the best comes from China, Japan or\r\nFrance. It is a product of decay in feldspar rocks. The potash is\r\nwashed out, and the silica and alumina left as parts of a white clay\r\nof fine grain.\r\n\r\nCoal. Anthracite is bituminous coal that has been subjected to great\r\nheat and pressure; in plain language, baked. It contains over 90 per\r\ncent. of carbon. Specific gravity 1.5 to 1.8. Hardness, 2.3 to 2.6.\r\nThe ash left after burning is white or red. There is little or no\r\nsulphur in anthracite. It does not coke.\r\n\r\nThere are three main divisions of coal, arranged according to their\r\ncarbon, water and ash. They are:\r\n\r\n                   Carbon.       Water.         Ash.\r\n    Anthracite    80-95 p.c.     2-3  p.c.    4-10 p.c.\r\n    Bituminous    45-80 p.c.     1-5  p.c.    8-20 p.c.\r\n    Lignite        7-45 p.c.    15-36 p.c.    6-40 p.c.\r\n\r\nGood bituminous coal contains about 85 per cent. of carbon, but the\r\ncomposition varies greatly. Cannel coal is a variety of bituminous\r\nthat gives off much gas. It burns with a bright flame in an open\r\ngrate, igniting as easily as a candle. Lignite is intermediate between\r\ncoal and peat. All the Rocky Mountain coals are lignites. It is a very\r\ninferior coal at its worst, while at its best it is nearly the equal\r\nof a poor bituminous coal.\r\n\r\nSome coals will coke and others will not; nothing but a trial can\r\nsettle this matter in each individual case. Good coking coal is very\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nCobalt. Cobalt ores are always found in veins with other metals. Pure\r\ncobalt is extremely rare. Cobalt colors are used for porcelain\r\npainting, glass-staining, etc.\r\n\r\nChromium. All chrome is obtained from chromite, which contains 68 per\r\ncent. of chrome sesqui-oxide, the remainder being iron protoxide.\r\nHardness, 5.5; gravity, 4.4; luster, sub-metallic; opaque. Steel-gray\r\nto almost black. Harsh. Brittle. Cleavage, imperfect. Fracture,\r\nuneven. Texture, massive to granular. Chromite in gravel looks like\r\nshot. Serpentine often contains it, when it is apt to resemble a\r\nfine-grained magnetite. It is used chiefly in iron and steel alloys,\r\nand in making armor plate. It is also used in dyeing fabrics and in\r\npaint manufacture. But little chrome ore is produced in the United\r\nStates. The importation in 1899 was 15,793 tons, value $18.03 per ton.\r\n\r\n    Chromite, FeOCr{2}O{3}      47-68\r\n\r\nThis ore is merchantable at $22 to $25 per ton.\r\n\r\nDomestic ore ranges from $10 to $12 a ton, while the pure imported\r\nores are worth $21 a ton. The yearly consumption in the United States\r\nis about 16,000 tons, and the American production 100 tons. This ore\r\nis useful as a lining for furnaces, and the demand promises to become\r\nimportant. Newfoundland is said to contain large deposits.\r\n\r\nCopper. Native copper occurs in the Lake Superior region, but the\r\ndemands of commerce are supplied from chalcopyrite or copper pyrites,\r\nand tetrahedrite or gray copper ore. Many different ores of copper may\r\nexist in the same vein. On the surface an iron cap of gossan reveals\r\nthe deposit; immediately below may be black oxide of copper with some\r\nmalachite, lower down red oxide, and below the water-line copper\r\nsulphides. The following are the principal copper ores:\r\n\r\n                   Sp. Gravity.   Hardness.   P. C. Cu.\r\n    Native copper      8.8          2.8         100\r\n    Chalcopyrite       4.2          3.7          35\r\n    Enargite           4.4          3.0          48\r\n    Tetrahedite        5.0       3.5 to 4.5      35\r\n    Chalcocite         5.6          2.7          80\r\n    Bornite            5.0          3.0          55\r\n    Melaconite         6.2       2.0 to 3.0      80\r\n    Cuprite            6.0          3.6          89\r\n    Chrysocolla        2.2          3.0          45\r\n\r\nThe common ore is native copper, often associated with native silver,\r\nthe two remaining, chemically, quite distinct. Some masses of copper\r\noccur that are too large to handle and must be cut by cold chisels, a\r\nmethod that costs more for labor than the value of the metal. The Lake\r\nSuperior mines produce 140,000,000 pounds of copper a year, while\r\nthose of Montana made the gigantic output of 228,000,000 pounds in\r\n1896. The great Anaconda mine, of Butte, is the heaviest producer,\r\nyielding more than half the state's total.\r\n\r\nDuring 1899 the New York copper market rate varied between 14.75 cents\r\nand 18.46 cents per pound. Copper is probably abundant in the shape of\r\npyrites in many parts of Canada, especially in the Northwest, and\r\nprospectors in that region should search diligently for it. The Lake\r\nSuperior mines are unique in being deposits of native copper.\r\n\r\nOwing to the great demand for copper following upon the extraordinary\r\nspread of electricity, copper properties have become so enormously\r\nvaluable that, possibly, the explorer will be quite as fortunate in\r\nfinding copper as in finding gold. Moreover, with the exception of\r\nSpain and Chili, the United States has no serious rivals in copper\r\nproduction,--Montana and Michigan, producing the greater part of the\r\noutput. The famous Calumet and Hecla mine, in Michigan, is now down\r\n4,000 feet and still yields ore. The most copper ores are not\r\ndifficult to distinguish. Every one is familiar with the ruddy hue of\r\npure copper, the color of the native metal. It may be flattened under\r\nthe hammer or cut with the knife. A little of the ore mixed with\r\ngrease colors a flame green. Copper ores are heavy, and generally of a\r\nbright color, either red, blue, green, yellow or brown.\r\n\r\nCorundum. Nine hundred and seventy tons of this abrasive were produced\r\nin the United States in 1899; value, $78,570. Corundum is found in\r\nfeldspar veins, and associated with chlorites in serpentine rock.\r\nNorth Carolina furnishes half the corundum marketed. The presence of\r\nthis substance is always indicated in the South by serpentine,\r\nchrysolite, or olivine rocks; experience being the only guide the\r\nminers have in finding new deposits. The contacts of the olivine rocks\r\nwith gneiss usually produce rich deposits. Corundum is the hardest\r\nsubstance known, next to the diamond. It is used as a polishing\r\npowder. Emery is an impure corundum containing iron. Corundum is\r\ncomposed of 53 per cent. aluminum and 47 per cent. oxygen. Specific\r\ngravity is 4. Hardness, 9.\r\n\r\nFeldspar. The Maine, Pennsylvania, New York, and Connecticut ores are\r\nworth $3 to $6 per long ton (2,240 pounds) at point of production.\r\n\r\nFluorspar. The American market is supplied by ore from Rosiclare,\r\nIll., Marion, Ky., Hardin Co., Ill., and Liumpton Co., Ky., and\r\nimported spar. It is worth $6 a ton of 2,000 pounds. This spar is\r\nsofter than quartz and of most brilliant colors, varying through the\r\nyellows, greens, blues and reds, to pure white. The streak is always\r\nwhite. Specific gravity, 3. Hardness, 4. It is worth mining when\r\nabundant and accessible.\r\n\r\nGems. Gems are to be looked for in a country of crystalline rock, such\r\nas granite, gneiss, dolomite, etc. Topaz and ruby are generally\r\ndiscovered in crystalline limestones, while turquoise is usually found\r\nin clay slate. It is not likely that the American prospector will come\r\nupon the true oriental ruby; he will more probably find the garnet.\r\nThe ruby is next to the diamond in hardness and in value, and consists\r\npractically of pure alumina. The garnet is but as hard as quartz, and\r\nis a silicate of alumina with lime and a little iron. They crystallize\r\nin different systems, the more valuable gem belonging to the\r\nrhombohedral, and the less valuable to the isometric system.\r\n\r\nThe turquoise which has lately been found in Arizona is not a crystal.\r\nThe blue color which distinguishes it is derived from copper. It is a\r\nphosphate of alumina with water in composition. In form it is kidney\r\nshaped or stalactitic. Lazulite, a far less valuable substance, is\r\nalso blue, but as it crystallizes in the monoclinic system it should\r\nnot be mistaken for turquoise. Moreover, lazulite is softer and\r\ncontains magnesia and lime, which the turquoise does not. Lapis\r\nlazuli, which is also occasionally mistaken for turquoise, belongs to\r\nthe regular or isometric system; it is commonly massive or compact,\r\nand is a silicate of alumina with some lime and iron. It is found in\r\nsyenite, crystalline, limestone, and often associated with pyrites and\r\nmica.\r\n\r\nTopaz belongs to the orthorhombic system. It is a silicate of alumina\r\nwith fluorine. Powdered, mixed, and heated with microcosmic salt in\r\nthe open tube, fluorine is disengaged with its characteristic odor,\r\nand etching action upon glass. With the blow pipe on charcoal, heated\r\nwith the cobalt solution, it gives the fine blue color of alumina.\r\n\r\nThe explorer who comes upon any hard, brightly colored stone, that may\r\npossibly turn out a gem, should preserve it carefully until he returns\r\nto some city, when it should be submitted to an expert. The value of a\r\ngem depends upon so many qualities that it were hopeless for the tyro\r\nto endeavor to arrive at any just estimate of it. He might ruin a\r\nsuperb specimen, without becoming one bit the wiser. A few of the more\r\nprominent characters of valuable gems follow:\r\n\r\n      Name.      Sp. Gravity.    Hardness.   Color.\r\n    Aquamarine        2.7          7.7     Blue.\r\n    Emerald           2.7          7.5     Green.\r\n    Diamond           3.5         10.0     Colorless.\r\n    Garnet            4.1          7.0     Claret.\r\n    Opal              2.2          6.0     Opaline.\r\n    Ruby              3.5          8.0     Dark red.\r\n    Tourmaline        3.1          7.3     Various.\r\n    Turquoise         2.7          6.0     Blue, green.\r\n    Ultramarine       2.5          5.8     Blue to green.\r\n\r\nGraphite. This mineral is commonly known as black lead, or plumbago.\r\nIt is the same in composition as the diamond, viz.: 100 per cent.\r\ncarbon. Specific gravity, 2 to 2.2. Hardness, 1.2 to 1.9. Color,\r\nblack. Greasy. Of value when free from impurities. Used in making\r\npencils, stove polish, crucibles, etc. Found in the earlier rocks.\r\n\r\nGypsum. A sulphate of lime occurring in great beds. Burnt, it becomes\r\nplaster of paris.\r\n\r\nIron. This, the most important of all metals, is found in various\r\nforms. The ores of iron are:\r\n\r\n                 Sp. Gravity.  Hardness.  P. C. Fe.\r\n    Native ore       7.7         4.5        100\r\n    Magnetite        5.1         6.0         72\r\n    Hematite         4.8         6.0         70\r\n    Limonite         3.8         5.2         60\r\n    Siderite         3.8         4.0         62\r\n    Pyrite           5.0         6.3         47\r\n\r\nNative iron is only found in meteorites that have come from space.\r\n\r\nMagnetite is loadstone ore; the powder is reddish black, and the ore,\r\ndark brown to black. It is found in the older rocks and is an\r\nimportant ore.\r\n\r\nHematite varies from metallic to dull in luster. There are many\r\nvarieties of it, known as ironstone, ocher, needle ore, etc. Hematite\r\nmay be slightly magnetic. Immense beds exist in the triassic\r\nsandstones, and in the secondary rocks below the coal measures. The\r\npowder and streak of limonite are always yellow; it is an important\r\nore. Siderite assumes many forms. It is called spathic ore,\r\nclay-ironstone, carbonate of iron, black band, etc. Most of these\r\ncarbonate iron ores only range between 30 and 40 per cent. of metallic\r\niron, but are in demand as fluxes for other iron ores. The pyritic\r\nores of iron, including marcasite, pyrrhotite and mispickel, are often\r\ntaken for gold by the inexperienced. In an accessible region pyrites\r\nmay be valuable, as they are bought by makers of sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nIron is so low in price that vast deposits exist which cannot be made\r\nuse of because they would be too expensive to mine. A deep bed, or a\r\nnarrow one, or the slightest difficulty in transportation, would\r\npreclude any profitable development. It is known that enormous areas\r\nin northern Labrador, for instance, are full of iron deposits, yet\r\nthere seems no chance of their having the slightest economic value for\r\na long time, if ever. Conditions of commerce very different to those\r\nnow obtaining will have to exist before they can be utilized.\r\n\r\nIron ore is most favorably situated for profitable extraction when it\r\nis near coking coal and beds of limestone; the former for fuel, the\r\nlatter for flux. Occasionally such regions as that of Lake Superior\r\nmay be able to compete successfully with others, although they do not\r\npossess the necessary smelting facilities, because these deficiencies\r\nare counterbalanced by inexhaustive stores of easily mined ores, and\r\ntransportation facilities unrivaled in cheapness.\r\n\r\nLead. The two important sources of supply are galena and cerussite.\r\nThe former contains 87 per cent. of lead, and frequently some silver\r\nand gold. It is so distinctive as to be easily recognized. Luster,\r\nmetallic; opaque; lead-gray; harsh. Brittle to sectile (may be cut).\r\nCleavage, perfect. Fracture, even to sub-conchoidal. Structure,\r\ngranular or foliated, tabular, or fibrous. Specific gravity is 7.5,\r\nand hardness, 2.6.\r\n\r\nThe carbonate cerussite contains about 79 per cent. lead. Luster,\r\nvitreous to resinous. Translucent. Color, gray. Smooth. Brittle.\r\nCleavage, perfect to imperfect. Fracture, conchoidal. Massive to\r\ngranular. Rich carbonate ores look like clay, and are undoubtedly\r\noften passed by.\r\n\r\nThe economic ores of lead are:\r\n\r\n                                                         Lead.\r\n    Galena        PbS                                  86.6  p.c.\r\n    Cerussite     PbCO{3}                              77.5  p.c.\r\n    Anglesite     PbSO{4}                              67.7  p.c.\r\n    Pyromorphite  Pb{3}P{2}O{8} plus 1/3 PbCl{2}       75.36 p.c.\r\n\r\nLead ores are frequently rich in silver. They occur in limestone,\r\nsandstone, granite and clay. The commercial ores are galena, which is\r\neasily recognized by its steel-like cubes, and the carbonates. These\r\nlatter are like lightly colored clays when in powder and are very apt\r\nto be overlooked. Fluor spar is as favorable a gangue for lead as\r\nquartz is for gold.\r\n\r\nThe Rocky Mountains are the principal American sources of this metal,\r\nbut a very large amount comes from the Mississippi valley. In the\r\nmountains the ore is a by-product, in silver smelting, being obtained\r\nfrom argentiferous galena, while in Missouri, Kansas, Wisconsin and\r\nIllinois lead and zinc are found free from any mixture with the\r\nprecious metal. The age of these deposits varies from lower silurian\r\nor cambrian to the carboniferous.\r\n\r\nThe ore is found in limestone rocks,--sometimes in flat openings\r\nparallel to the almost horizontal beds, or else in gash veins almost\r\nat right angles to these. As lead is often found in dolomite\r\nlimestone, that is, limestone carrying almost as much magnesia as\r\nlime, and this rock was undoubtedly deposited in a shallow sea,\r\ngeologists incline to the belief that therefore the lead is due to a\r\ngrowth of seaweeds in whose ash this metal and zinc are known to\r\noccur. At any rate, these deposits now have great economic value, and\r\nthe lead and zinc ore is easily got at.\r\n\r\nGalena and zinc blende frequently resemble one another, but they may\r\nbe distinguished by this infallible sign: the powder of galena is\r\nblack, and that of blende brown, or yellow.\r\n\r\nLithographic Stone. This is a very fine grained compact limestone from\r\nBavaria. So far nothing equal to the imported stone has been found in\r\nAmerica. The distinguishing qualities are: Gray, drab or yellow;\r\nporous, yet not too soft; of fine texture, and free from veins and\r\ninequalities.\r\n\r\nManganese. Manganese ores in 1899 amounted in the United States to\r\n143,256 tons, value $306,476. This mineral is used for bleaching and\r\nmaking oxygen, and in steel manufacture. Pyrolusite contains 63 per\r\ncent. manganese. Hardness, 2.3. Specific gravity, 4.8. Luster,\r\nmetallic. Opaque. Gray to bluish black. Harsh. Brittle. Cleavage,\r\nimperfect. Fracture, uneven. Granular, massive. Manganite is harder,\r\n4.0; its specific gravity is 4.3. Luster, sub-metallic. Cleavage,\r\nperfect. Texture, fibrous. Wad is an impure ore of manganese found in\r\nbogs, of little or no value.\r\n\r\n    Pyrolusite      MnO{2}             63.2\r\n    Braunite        Mn{2}O{3}          69.68\r\n    Psilomelane     (Variable)           ?\r\n\r\nFranklinite, a zinc-manganese ore, is also a common source of supply.\r\nAn ore to be commercially valuable should contain from 40 to 60 per\r\ncent. metallic manganese, and not over 0.2 to 0.25 per cent.\r\nphosphorus.\r\n\r\nTo determine the value of manganese ores a somewhat intricate\r\ncalculation is necessary. Delivered at Bessemer, Pa., the Carnegie\r\nSteel Company pays according to the following sliding scale:\r\n\r\n    Per cent.      Mn.     Per Unit\r\n     over      49 p.c.     Fe.  Mn.\r\n      46       49 p.c.     6c  28c\r\n      43       46 p.c.     6c  27c\r\n      40       43 p.c.     6c  26c\r\n      37       40 p.c.     6c  25c\r\n      34       37 p.c.     6c  24c\r\n      31       34 p.c.     6c  23c\r\n                           6c  22c\r\n\r\nMoreover, for each one per cent. of silica in excess of eight per\r\ncent. a deduction of fifteen cents a ton is made, and a deduction of\r\none cent per unit of manganese is made for each 2/100 of one per cent.\r\nof phosphorous present in excess of 1/10 per cent. From which it is\r\nevident that there can be little profit in impure deposits of\r\nmanganese.\r\n\r\nMercury. Quicksilver usually occurs in the form of cinnabar, though\r\noccasional deposits of pure metal are found in drops and small\r\npockets, in limestone and the softer secondary rocks, including shales\r\nand slates. As the appearance of quicksilver must be familiar to all,\r\ncinnabar alone needs description. Its specific gravity is 9.0; its\r\nhardness, 2.2. It is a red brown earthy ore, the powder of which is a\r\ndull red. It is generally found in sandstone, though it occasionally\r\noccurs in slates, shales and serpentine. Heated gently with lime\r\ncinnabar yields quicksilver. If copper be held over the fumes of\r\nmercury it will be coated with a light film of the metal. An alloy\r\nwith silver has been found. Mercury is heavy, extremely brilliant, and\r\nmobile. The composition of cinnabar is:\r\n\r\n                        Per cent. Hg.\r\n    Cinnabar HgS            86.2\r\n\r\nAlthough but three American states have supplied this metal, this\r\ncountry has held rank as second producer. Of these California is by\r\nfar the most important. Oregon and Utah having never had any but a\r\nsmall and spasmodic output. Judging by Californian experience, the\r\nprospector is most likely to find cinnabar, the ore from which the\r\nquicksilver of commerce is derived, in metamorphic rocks. Mercury is\r\nalways sold in flasks of 76-1/2 pounds. The production of mercury by\r\nthe United States (California) was 28,879 flasks in 1899, which were\r\nvalued at $1,155,160.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the rock in which the most famous\r\nCalifornian quicksilver mines are:\r\n\r\n        Mine.       County.         Rock.\r\n    Sulphur Creek   Colusa       Serpentine.\r\n    Abbott          Lake         Shale-serpentine.\r\n    Great Western   Lake         Serpentine. (?)\r\n    Ætna            Napa         Sandstone.\r\n    Corona          Napa         Sandstone-serpentine.\r\n    Aat Hill        Napa         Sandstone.\r\n    New Almaden     Santa Clara  Shale-serpentine.\r\n    Barton          Siskiyou     Shale-sandstone.\r\n    Cinnabar King   Sonoma       Sandstone-serpentine.\r\n    Altoona         Trinity      Porphyry-serpentine.\r\n\r\nA study of the foregoing shows that serpentine is almost as intimately\r\nconnected with quicksilver as is quartz with gold, or granite with\r\ntin. These are the things that prospectors should make a note of. With\r\nthe great increase of gold mining and the limited store of cinnabar\r\nthat is available that ore seems certain to rise in value before long.\r\n\r\nMica. The value of Indian mica varies from 90¢ a pound for sheets 4\r\nin. × 1 in. to $13 a pound for sheets 10 in. × 8 in. The white mica\r\nin large sheets is valuable. The amber-colored, and spotted, are used\r\nfor insulating purposes in electric plants, while the coarser sorts\r\nare ground and used as lubricants, or in fire-proof paint manufacture.\r\n\r\nNickel. This ore is never found in metallic form, but always in\r\ncombination. Pyrrhotite, or magnetic pyrites, is the source of about\r\nall the nickel of commerce. This ore has been already noticed under\r\niron. Rare but valuable ores of nickel are millerite, nickelite,\r\nglance, and nickel bloom.\r\n\r\n                          Per cent. nickel.\r\n    Millerite    NiS            64.4\r\n    Niccolite    NiAs           44.0\r\n\r\nSome of the nickel of commerce is derived from nickelliferous\r\npyrrhotite.\r\n\r\nPetroleum. Crude petroleum is never found in metamorphic or igneous\r\nrocks. The stratified rocks of the Devonian, Carboniferous and\r\nCretaceous ages are most likely to hold it. The crude oil is almost\r\nblack, and consists of about 85 per cent. of carbon, and 15 per cent.\r\nof hydrogen. A long iron-shod stick is all the prospector requires to\r\ntake with him in his search for surface indications of oil. The warmer\r\nthe day the easier the search, as the oil rises to the surface of the\r\nstreams, and is found in greater quantities than on cold days.\r\n\r\nOil existing in the lower rocks ascends through them until it\r\naccumulates under some layer that will not let it pass through. In\r\nthis condition deep boring finds it, the rod usually tapping gas\r\nfirst. Petroleum may be noticed oozing out of gravel banks, or\r\nfloating as a scum on the surface, whenever abundant. It has been\r\nfound in rocks of widely different age, from extremely ancient\r\nformations to some that did not precede man by so very long,\r\ngeologically speaking.\r\n\r\nPlatinum. This metal is only found native. Its gravity is very high,\r\nfrom 16 to 22. Hardness, 4 to 4.5. Luster, metallic. Opaque.\r\nWhitish-gray. Smooth. Ductile. Cleavage, none. Fracture, hackly.\r\nTexture, granular, fine. Platinum is unaffected by acids, but if\r\nalloyed with 10 per cent. of silver it dissolves in nitric acid.\r\nAlmost infusible. Platinum occurs with placer gold in the beds of\r\nstreams. Usually it is in small grains, but one or two large nuggets\r\nare on record from Brazil and Siberia. Serpentine rocks are believed\r\nto have originally held the platinum found in the beds of rivers, but\r\nnone has been found in veins. The entire product of the United States\r\nwas 300 ounces in 1898; valued at $3,837. In 1899 there was none\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nSilver. Silver is generally found in serpentine, trap, sandstone,\r\nlimestone, shale, or porphyry rocks, the gangue being quartz, calc,\r\nfluor, or heavy spar. All silver ores are heavy, and many of them are\r\nsectile, i.e., may be cut with the knife. Western men test for silver\r\nby heating the ore and dipping it into water. Some metal comes to the\r\nsurface in a greasy scum, should silver be present. Native silver is\r\nfound occasionally. Owing to the fall in value of this metal its\r\nfuture is not assured. It has fallen, during the past year, once to\r\nforty-nine cents an ounce, and this has had a most disastrous effect\r\nupon many silver mines, forcing them to suspend operations. Should the\r\nfall continue, as seems likely, and the price of silver go down to\r\nforty cents an ounce, little will be produced except as a by-product\r\nin the treatment of argentiferous lead ores.\r\n\r\nAs silver enters into chemical combination with sulphur easily, as is\r\nseen by the black film that forms on silver articles in a room where\r\ngas is burnt, most silver ores are sulphides. The very abundance of\r\nsilver has caused its great fall in value, and it does not appear that\r\nit is ever likely to remain for long at a price exceeding fifty cents\r\nan ounce, owing to the ease with which it may be produced, and the\r\nlarge quantities that must find their way to market through it being a\r\nby-product in lead smelting. From 1859 to 1891 the Comstock lode in\r\nNevada produced $325,000,000. This lode is a belt of quartz, 10,000\r\nfeet long and several hundred wide, and is a contact vein between\r\ndiorite and diabase. In America galena is the principal source of\r\nsilver; the chlorides and oxides rank next; while, lastly, some silver\r\nis parted from gold when it reaches the mint, as gold always contains\r\nmore or less of that metal. No precise statement as to the manner of\r\nits occurrence may be made since it is found in many different\r\npositions, and is associated with all sorts of minerals. It is never\r\nfound in placer deposits, as it breaks up under the influence of\r\nwater, air, etc. Its original source is doubtless the igneous rocks,\r\nwhere it occurs in association with augite, hornblende and mica.\r\nSilver may be expected in mountainous regions of recent origin.\r\nBetween 1875 and 1891 the world's product rose from $82,000,000 to\r\n$185,599,600. Three quarters of this came from the western hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe commercial ores of silver are:\r\n\r\n                                               Silver.\r\n    Argentite       Ag{2}S                  87.1 per cent.\r\n    Proustite       3Ag{2}SAs{2}S{3}        65.5 per cent.\r\n    Prysagyrite     3Ag{2}SSb{2}S{3}        59.9 per cent.\r\n    Stephanite      5Ag{2}SSb{2}S{3}        68.5 per cent.\r\n    Cesargerite     AgCl                    75.3 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe Anaconda mine in Butte is the largest producer of silver in the\r\ncountry. In 1896 its output was 5,000,000 ounces. The Anaconda is also\r\nthe heaviest copper producer in the United States, its yield of copper\r\nbeing 125,350,693 pounds.\r\n\r\nSulphur. Brimstone is found native in the neighborhood of volcanoes,\r\nextinct or active. It is also derived from iron pyrites. Color,\r\nyellow. Hardness, 2. Specific gravity, 2. Luster, resinous. Smooth.\r\nSectile. Texture, crystalline.\r\n\r\nTalc. The scientific name of this mineral is steatite. It contains\r\nsilica and magnesia. Its green color, pearly luster, and greasy feel,\r\nare very characteristic. It is not attacked by boiling sulphuric acid.\r\nUseful in the arts, but of no great value.\r\n\r\nTin. The composition of cassiterite, the commercial ore of tin, is\r\nSnO{2}; equal to 78.67 per cent. of metallic tin. Cassiterite or tin\r\nstone is a heavy ore which occurs in alluvial deposits or in the beds\r\nof streams. It will be one of the latest ores the young prospector\r\nwill find himself able to name with certainty. Granite, with white\r\nmica as one of its constituents, has so far always been associated\r\nwith tin. The American continent yields little tin, and it is not\r\nlikely the prospector in either the western states or in Canada will\r\nstumble upon it, though a good deposit of stream tin would enrich him\r\nin a short time, for the metal is in great demand. The streak, when\r\nthe metal is scratched with a knife point, is whitey-gray and very\r\ndistinctive.\r\n\r\nTin may some day be found in the northern Rockies, as there is plenty\r\nof granite, which is favorable to this metal. It is worth about\r\nthirteen cents a pound, and a vein must yield more than five per cent.\r\nof metal to pay the cost of mining and dressing. Cassiterite, the\r\nprincipal tin ore, would have to be roasted. Most of the European tin\r\nmines were first worked for the copper they contained. The copper was\r\nfound in the capping, but as they gained in depth they became more and\r\nmore valuable for their tin. Some of the Cornish mines are\r\nthree-quarters of a mile in depth. Very lately tin has been discovered\r\nand mined in vast quantities in the Straits Settlements, India. As it\r\nis found in the streams the expense of mining is very light, and it is\r\nkilling the European mines. The Cornish miners put their tin ore on a\r\nshovel when they wish to test it. The sample is first crushed fine and\r\na few skillful shakes get rid of all the gangue, leaving behind the\r\ntin and wolfram. This wolfram is always associated, in Cornwall, with\r\nthe tin and it is got rid of by roasting. Australasia and Cornwall\r\nproduce most of the tin used in commerce. Tin is not found native.\r\nSpecific gravity of cassiterite is 6.5 to 7. Hardness, 6.5 to 7.\r\nLuster, vitreous to adamantine. Translucent to opaque. Brown, black,\r\ngray, red or yellow. Harsh. Brittle. Massive. The appearance of this\r\nmetal is so variable that nothing but a test with reagents determines\r\nit with certainty. Granite is frequently the country rock in which tin\r\nis found.\r\n\r\nZinc. This is another ore that never occurs native. Calamine or\r\nsilicate of zinc is the great producing ore. Composition: Zinc oxide,\r\n67 per cent; silicate, 25 per cent; water, 8 per cent. Specific\r\ngravity, 3 to 3.7. Hardness, 4.6 to 5. Luster, vitreous. Translucent.\r\nWhite. Harsh. Brittle. Cleavage, perfect. Fracture, uneven. Texture,\r\ngranular crystalline. Calamine is a difficult mineral to detect\r\nwithout experience, as when impure it does not look in the least like\r\na metallic ore. It would be taken for clay or shale. This ore results\r\nfrom the decomposition of zinc blende. Blende contains 67 per cent.\r\nzinc and 33 per cent. sulphur. It is often dark brown or black from\r\niron, otherwise it may be red, green or bluish. It is a troublesome\r\nimpurity in silver ores. Smithsonite is a carbonate much resembling,\r\nand often found with, calamine. Other zinc ores are merely curiosities\r\nand do not affect the commercial value of the metal.\r\n\r\nIn the New Jersey mines the zinc ores are the oxides zincite and\r\nwillemite, and the zinc-iron oxide franklinite. In the Missouri\r\nregion, on the other hand, sphalerite and blende are the typical ores.\r\nBlende generally associates with the lead sulphide, galena. The Joplin\r\ndistrict in southwestern Missouri and the adjoining region in Kansas\r\nare now mainly supplying the markets of the country, though the New\r\nJersey deposits are very valuable.\r\n\r\nJoplin ore assaying 58 to 62 per cent. has varied greatly in price\r\nduring the past four years. The lowest quotation was $20 a ton, the\r\nhighest $51.50.\r\n\r\nZinc is derived mainly from the following half dozen ores:\r\n\r\n                                                 Zinc.\r\n    Sphalerite      ZnS                     67.0    per cent.\r\n    Zincite         ZnO                     80.3 per cent.\r\n    Smithsonite     ZnOCO{2}                51.9 per cent.\r\n    Franklinite     (Variable) (?)           5.54 per cent.\r\n    Willemite       2ZnO.SO{2}              58.5  per cent.\r\n    Calamine        2ZnO.SiO{2}.HO{2}       54.2  per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMINING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the scope of this work does not include the very complex\r\nproblem involved in the working of a great mine, prospecting and the\r\nsimpler mining operations are so intimately connected that it would\r\nnot be desirable to make mention of the one and ignore the other,\r\nbecause the prospector must perforce become a miner as soon as he\r\ndiscovers mineral, even though his operations should not go beyond a\r\nshallow trial shaft.\r\n\r\nThe simplest method of hoisting dirt or rock out of a shaft, after it\r\nhas become too deep for the sinker to throw the stuff out with a\r\nspade, is by a bucket and windlass, which may be either single or\r\ndouble, according to the power required. In northwestern Canada, where\r\nthe present gold excitement has attracted so many thousand pioneers,\r\nthe miners have hitherto been content with a windlass. For their\r\npurpose it answers well, as they sink through gravel and not more than\r\nthirty feet at the most before reaching the bed rock. The alluvial\r\nflats in which the coarse gold of the upper Yukon has been discovered,\r\nare composed of gravel that is invariably frozen, summer as well as\r\nwinter, and which requires to be thawed out before it can be worked\r\nwith a pick. Strangely enough, dynamite cannot be used, as the ground\r\nis so elastic under the frost that the tamping simply blows out and\r\nthe required effect is not produced. This peculiar condition has led\r\nthe men, who are mining in that part of the continent, to adopt\r\nmethods very similar to those used in Siberia, where, also, the ground\r\nis permanently frozen to a great depth. After scratching the surface\r\nof the soil, and removing the deep moss that invariably covers it,\r\nthey light large fires over night and in the morning remove the few\r\ninches of thawed soil underneath the ashes. By this painfully slow\r\nmethod they eventually sink to the richer gravel, fifteen or twenty,\r\nor even thirty, feet below the surface, though there are few shafts of\r\nthis depth on the Klondike and the other gold-bearing creeks about\r\nwhich we have heard so much. When the bed rock is reached and the few\r\ninches of decayed surface removed, the miner builds his fire against\r\nthe side of the shaft, placing some inclined logs over it as a roof,\r\nand goes to bed. When he awakes next day several feet of the soil have\r\nfallen down over the logs, and this he has to hoist. It is at this\r\nstage that the windlass worked by his companion, or partner,\r\ndemonstrates its value. In a very short time all the gravel that the\r\nfire has thawed out is hoisted to the surface, and added to the dump,\r\nwhere it must remain until the warmth of summer shall have thawed the\r\nstreams and permitted sluicing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MINER'S GOLD PAN.]\r\n\r\nA sluice is really nothing more nor less than a trough, open at the\r\ntop, in which the gold is sorted from the lighter gravel and dirt by\r\nrunning water. The grade varies according to the coarseness of the\r\ngold. Very fine gold would be carried away by too swift a current,\r\nwhile coarse gold will resist almost a torrent. The sluice is built in\r\njoints, usually a dozen feet in length; the sides may be six inches or\r\na foot deep, and the width varies from one to two feet. There is no\r\nrule in this matter, but owing to the extravagant price of lumber--as\r\nmuch as a hundred and fifty dollars a thousand feet, board\r\nmeasure--the tendency is to make the sluices very small and very\r\nshort, thereby saving nothing but the very coarsest gold. A properly\r\nconstructed sluice should be several hundred feet in length, and the\r\ninclination should not be more than one foot in twelve, while it may,\r\nin a case of fine gold, be advisable to diminish this inclination by\r\nat least a fourth. Riffles, or cross-pieces, are placed across the\r\nsluice at intervals of a few feet, and slats are placed lengthwise,\r\nfilling up the intervals between the riffles. Into the crevices and\r\ninterstices of these obstructions the heavy gold sinks by its own\r\nweight, and every few days, or weeks, as the case may warrant, the\r\nminer shuts off the water by closing the gate at the head of the\r\nsluice, removes the slats and riffles, beginning at the joint nearest\r\nthe head and working towards the tail of the sluiceway, and collects\r\nall the gold that has accumulated.\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple form of mining, but it is not the simplest. Much\r\ngold has been recovered from the gravel in which nature has placed it\r\nby the aid of the pan, a sheet iron dish modeled on the housewife's\r\nbread pan.\r\n\r\nNext to the pan the cradle is as little complicated as anything used\r\nin the winning of gold.\r\n\r\nAfter this comes the long tom, a considerable improvement upon the\r\ncradle, but it necessitates more water and more men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORSE WHIM.]\r\n\r\nThe horse whim is used in developing many a western prospect. The\r\nwindlass does not work well below forty feet, and where fuel and water\r\nare to be had any sensible man will use steam power for deep mining,\r\nbut there is a gap between the windlass and the steam hoist which the\r\nhorse whim fills acceptably. To a depth of 300 feet a horse whim can\r\nusually handle the rock and water. It is inexpensive, in the first\r\noutlay, and costs but little to run. You can bring your bucket from a\r\nshaft a hundred and fifty feet deep in two and a half minutes, and\r\nwith a seven hundred pound capacity in the bucket, in forty-five trips\r\nyou could raise fifteen tons a day. A shaft three hundred feet deep\r\nwould require four hours' steady work to bring to surface the same\r\namount. A fair speed with a one-horse whim from a three hundred foot\r\nshaft is one hundred buckets per shift of ten hours, but the\r\nprospector rarely has to figure on shafts of that depth. If the mine\r\nturns out well it is likely to be in the hands of a powerful company\r\n(of which he should be the principal shareholder) before the three\r\nhundred foot level is reached. The weight of the horse whim is about\r\neight hundred pounds. It can be taken to pieces and packed anywhere\r\nthat a mule can travel; the heaviest piece will not weigh more than a\r\nhundred pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROSPECTING MILL WITH HORSE POWER.]\r\n\r\nA small stamp mill, run by horse power, is a very favorite machine\r\nwith western men, where the ore is free milling. The mortar in which\r\nthe stamps work has copper plates amalgamated with mercury inside, and\r\ncopper tables with amalgamated plates over which the pulp passes after\r\noozing through a fine screen in front of the mortar. These little\r\nmills are so constructed that they can be taken apart or put together\r\nin an hour or two. They require but one horse power and will do good\r\nclean work up to their capacity. The following are the specifications\r\nof a good one:\r\n\r\n    Total weight                     1,500 pounds.\r\n    Weight of heaviest piece           350 pounds.\r\n    Weight of stamp                    100 pounds.\r\n    Drops per minute                     60 to 80.\r\n    Capacity per hour           300 to 400 pounds.\r\n    Diameter of pulley                  30 inches.\r\n    Price, with horse power,           about $350.\r\n\r\nA diamond drill is a most useful adjunct to exploration of a mine or\r\ndeposit. It is, essentially, a hollow drill which may be lengthened at\r\nwill, rotating rapidly and carrying a crown of \"bort\" or black\r\ndiamonds at its extremity, that eats into the strata very quickly.\r\nHoles 3,000 feet deep have been driven by the diamond drill, but such\r\nextensive investigations of the earth's crust are tremendously costly,\r\nand may only be undertaken by governments or rich companies. For a\r\ndepth of 700 feet, however, the expense need not exceed $2,100. The\r\ncost of the plant for drilling would be $3,500 more. Water is pumped\r\ndown the hollow center of the drill, to keep it cool. The great\r\nadvantage of the diamond over the percussion drill is that it permits\r\nthe saving of a core, so that the character of the rocks and minerals\r\npassed through may be known. The diamond drill does better work in\r\nhard strata than it does in soft. The rate, in limestone, may be about\r\ntwo feet an hour, down to a depth of 200 feet.\r\n\r\nA complete outfit for boring with the diamond drill includes a steam\r\nengine and boiler, diamond crown, lining tubes, rods, and various\r\nminor accessories.\r\n\r\nHydraulic mining is the cheapest known method of recovering gold. In\r\nfour years the North Bloomfield Mining Company of California worked\r\n325,000,000 cubic yards, which yielded only 2.9 cents of gold per\r\ncubic yard, and realized some profit. Very poor gravel will pay when\r\nthe conditions are good. Cheap water, grades of four inches in a\r\nhundred, ample dumping room, big banks of light gravel, large areas of\r\ndeposits, labor at a dollar a day, and a clever superintendent, make a\r\ncombination that will yield a profit out of three-cent gravel.\r\n\r\nMiners speak of \"surface\" and \"deep\" placers; of \"hill claims;\" of\r\n\"bench claims\" on the old river terraces; of \"gulch diggings;\" of \"bar\r\nclaims\" on the sand bars of existing rivers; of \"beach sands\" or those\r\nthat in a few favored localities border the ocean. A \"sluice\" is a\r\nlong boxway to catch the gold; a \"drift\" is a tunnel into the\r\ngold-bearing gravel; and hydraulic diggings are those in which water\r\nunder pressure is used to disintegrate the gravel.\r\n\r\nA ground-sluice is a trench cut through the bed rock. The roughness of\r\nthe natural floor serves for riffles. Booming is a process requiring a\r\nlarge accumulation of water in a reservoir, which may be discharged at\r\nonce, and carry all the material that has collected below the pass,\r\nwith one full tide, into the sluices. This practice is extremely\r\nancient; Pliny mentions it in his Natural History.\r\n\r\nDeep mining may be divided into drifting and hydraulic mining. In the\r\nformer the metal is won by means of tunnels and drifts or horizontal\r\npassageways along the length of the deposit. It is usually resorted to\r\nin districts where a flow of lava has covered the gold-bearing gravel,\r\nand made hydraulic mining impossible. It is followed in Alaska for\r\nanother reason, viz., because the constantly frozen ground will not\r\npermit of the more remunerative method. The gravel is carried to the\r\nmouth of the tunnel and there dumped to be washed in the sluices. When\r\n\"cemented\" it must be broken up by stamps.\r\n\r\nRich deep placers may be worked by drifting, but whenever practicable\r\nhydraulicing is to be preferred as giving better results. It yields\r\nfrom four to six times the amount of gold that drifting does. Thorough\r\nexploration should precede the expenditure of large sums in a\r\nhydraulic plant. Even should the explorations result in finding barren\r\ngravels the money will have been well spent in saving the cost of an\r\nunproductive plant.\r\n\r\nBlack sand (magnetic iron) almost always accompanies gold, but this\r\nalone is no sign that gold is present, as black sand may usually be\r\nobtained by grinding and washing crystalline rocks.\r\n\r\nDitches and flumes of wood or metal are used to bring the water for\r\nhydraulic mining from the region where it was impounded in a catch\r\nbasin, often a distance of many miles. It is said $100,000,000 have\r\nbeen invested in ditches and flumes, mining and agricultural, in the\r\nwestern states, and new flumes are being planned every month. Some of\r\nthem consist of wrought iron pipe carried over ravines by trestles 250\r\nfeet high.\r\n\r\nIn planning a ditch the miner must see to it that his water supply is\r\nat a sufficient elevation to command the ground. The more pressure the\r\nwater works under the better. The supply should be continuous, or at\r\nleast be available during the whole working season. Ditches in regions\r\nof deep snow should have a southern exposure. All streams crossed by\r\nthe ditch should be diverted into it, to counteract leakage and other\r\nloss. Waste gates must be provided every half mile. Ditches are better\r\nthan flumes. Narrow, deep, and steep ditches are to be preferred in\r\nmountainous regions, and the reverse in valleys with soft soil. Some\r\nCalifornian ditches with a capacity of 80 cubic feet per second and\r\ngrades of 16 to 20 feet per mile have been built.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF DITCH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF FLUME.]\r\n\r\nSometimes the face of the country requires flumes; they may even be\r\nhung along the face of a cliff. In shattered ground and where water is\r\nscarce flumes are better than ditches. The grade for a flume is\r\nusually 25 to 35 feet per mile and its capacity is smaller than that\r\nof a ditch. Pine planking 2-1/2 inches by 12 to 24 inches, and 12 feet\r\nlong, is the dimension stuff generally preferred. A flume 2 feet 6\r\ninches square requires posts, caps, and sills of 3×4 inch; stringers\r\n4×6 inch. Great care is needed at curves to avoid slack water and\r\nsplashing. The boxes must be shortened and the outer side wedged up\r\nuntil the water flows as evenly as in the straight stretches. Should\r\nanchor ice form the water must be shut off at once. The life of a\r\nflume seldom exceeds a dozen years, whereas at the end of a similar\r\nperiod a ditch would be carrying 10 per cent more water than at first,\r\nowing to the sides and bottom having become consolidated.\r\n\r\nWrought iron pipes are employed largely in California to replace\r\nditches and flumes. When the pipe crosses a ravine it is known as\r\nan inverted siphon. Piping is also used to convey water from the\r\n\"pressure box\" to the \"gates\" and \"nozzle.\" Wrought iron pipes have to\r\nstand pressure varying from 34 pounds to 800 pounds to the square\r\ninch. Air valves or blow-offs must be provided at intervals to allow\r\nthe escape of air from the pipe while filling, and to prevent a\r\ncollapse of the pipe after a break. A covering of coal-tar should be\r\ngiven the pipe both inside and out. Cost varies from one dollar to two\r\ndollars a running foot.\r\n\r\nThe pressure box ends the ditch and from it the water passes into the\r\nsupply pipe. The head of water is measured from this point. A box to\r\ncatch sand and gravel, with a side opening and sunk below the level of\r\nthe ditch, is called the \"sand box.\"\r\n\r\nOne and a half inch plank is generally the material out of which the\r\npressure box is made. The depth of water in it is such that the mouth\r\nof the pipe is always under water. A grating in front of the pipe\r\ncatches all rubbish. As no air must be allowed to get into the pipe\r\nthe water must be kept quiet and deep at the pipe-head; this is\r\ninsured by dividing the box into compartments, the first receiving the\r\nwater and discharging it through suitable openings into the second.\r\nThe water supply and the discharge should be equal. The water passes\r\ndown the feed pipe, iron gates distributing it to the discharge pipes.\r\nWater must be turned on gradually, and the air valves must be open.\r\nThe piping terminates in a nozzle with knuckle-joint and lateral\r\nmovement. Nothing but the most secure bolting to heavy timber and the\r\nheavy weighting of the last length of pipe should be relied upon to\r\nkeep the hydraulic giant in its place. Should it once begin bucking\r\nevery man within reach of the powerful column of water is in imminent\r\ndanger. The nozzle is directed by means of a larger deflecting nozzle,\r\nwhich receives the impact of the water and causes the main nozzle to\r\nswing right or left, up or down, as the case may demand.\r\n\r\nA derrick capable of moving heavy boulders, and driven by water power,\r\nis a necessity in all hydraulic mining. Masts 100 feet high and booms\r\n90 feet long are sometimes used, the motive power coming from a \"hurdy\r\ngurdy\" direct impact wheel. Experiments have shown that the bucket has\r\nmuch to do with the power of the wheel. For instance, when the water\r\nimpinged against a flat bucket the efficiency of the wheel was less\r\nthan 45 per cent. of what it should have been in theory, whereas, with\r\nthe Pelton bucket, it rose to 82.6 per cent.\r\n\r\nThere is a great amount of so-called cement, or in other words\r\nconsolidated gravel, in all the northern placers, and in many\r\nCalifornia deposits, as well. In the old Cariboo diggings on the upper\r\nFrazer, strong companies are now pulverizing the ancient cements that\r\nresisted all the efforts of the 59 miners with powder and stamp mill,\r\nand are deriving large profits therefrom.\r\n\r\nBlack powder gives even better results than dynamite in gravel. The\r\nusual allowance of powder is 20 pounds in weight for every 1,000 cubic\r\nfeet of ground to be moved. Make drifts T-shaped, and tamp the main\r\ndrift almost to the junction with the arms, which should be parallel\r\nto the face it is required to dislodge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PELTON WATER WHEEL.]\r\n\r\nSluices have their maximum discharge when set straight. Increased\r\ngrade may be given below any unavoidable curves with advantage, and\r\nthe outer side of the sluice must always be raised. Steps or \"drops\"\r\nin the sluices help in the recovery of the gold. In general, a grade\r\nof 6-6-1/2 inches to the 12-foot box is found best; this is equal to a\r\n4-4-1/2 per cent. grade. Exceptional instances are on record, however,\r\nwhere grades ran from 1-1/2 per cent. to 8 per cent. In a 4 to 7 per\r\ncent. grade the water in the sluice should be 10 inches deep at least.\r\nThe following table gives useful details:\r\n\r\n       Sluice.            Grade.               Water.\r\n    6 ft. × 36 in.     4 to 5 p.c.      2,000 to 3,500 m. in.\r\n    4 ft. × 30 in.     4 p.c.           1,800 to 2,000 m. in.\r\n    3 ft. × 30 in.     1-1/2 p.c.         600 to 1,000 m. in.\r\n\r\n\"The longer the better,\" is the sluice-builder's motto. The best\r\n\"riffles\" are made of blocks of pine 8 to 13 inches deep, wedged into\r\nthe bottom of the sluices. They are laid in rows separated by a space\r\nof an inch or an inch and a half. Riffle strips keep them in position,\r\nthese latter being laid crosswise on the bottom. When worn down to\r\nfive inches, the blocks should be replaced. This amount of wear will\r\nprobably require six months. Stone and longitudinal riffles running\r\nlengthwise of the box are often preferred.\r\n\r\nAn undercurrent is a broad sluice set at a heavy grade below the level\r\nof the main sluice. The fine stuff drops through a grating, while the\r\ncoarse gravel continues on down the sluice.\r\n\r\nRefuse material from quartz, hydraulic or other mines is known as\r\ntailings. Tailings are deposited on a dump, which in the case of a\r\nhydraulic claim must be sufficiently spacious to receive the thousands\r\nof yards of debris deposited on it each day. When available a narrow,\r\ndeep canyon, or a tunnel, may take the places of dumps.\r\n\r\nQuicksilver is used in the sluices, 14 to 18 flasks being used every\r\nfortnight in a long sluice. It is not placed in the last 300 or 400\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nIn working, keep the face of the bank \"square.\" Washing should be\r\ncarried on continuously. Watches must be set over the sluices, or gold\r\nis likely to be missed. As an extra precaution, the sluices should be\r\nrun full of gravel before shutting off the water. There is no fixed\r\ncustom regulating \"clean ups.\" Some managers do so every 20 days,\r\nothers run two or three months, others again clean up but once in a\r\nseason. In large operations, the first 2,000 feet of sluice are\r\ncleaned up every fortnight; the remaining boxes once a year.\r\n\r\nSluices are cleaned from the head downward, the blocks being taken up\r\nfor that purpose. The amalgam of gold and quicksilver is collected in\r\nsheet iron buckets. The final step is reached when the amalgam is\r\nretorted and melted in a graphite crucible.\r\n\r\nThe principle of which the hydraulic miner takes advantage is the\r\ngreat specific gravity of gold as compared with water and rock. To\r\nillustrate this quality it may be noted that on a smooth surface\r\ninclined at an angle of 1 in 48, subjected to a heavy stream of water,\r\n95 per cent. of the fine gold in gravel does not travel three feet.\r\n\r\nThe loss of quicksilver fed into sluices will vary, even under good\r\nmanagement, from 11 per cent. to 25 per cent. of the amount fed to the\r\nboxes.\r\n\r\nHydraulic mines under favorable conditions are very paying\r\ninvestments. Gravel yielding 10 cents a cubic yard has been worked for\r\n6 cents a cubic yard, at the rate of a million cubic yards a year. On\r\nanother large claim 600,000 cubic yards were worked for 6 cents a\r\ncubic yard, yielding 13 cents a cubic yard.\r\n\r\nRiver dredging is another form of gold winning that has been brought\r\nto a great state of perfection in New Zealand. Although the dredge has\r\nnot yet acquired the importance in America that was expected, it is\r\nsuccessful on one or two western rivers, and as the subject becomes\r\nbetter understood it is conceivable that American mining engineers\r\nwill be as successful in devising improved dredges as they have been\r\nin all other branches of their profession.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand the bucket dredge has proved more satisfactory than the\r\nsuction dredge, although a hasty conclusion would probably give the\r\nlatter the palm. At Bannack, Mont., the Bucyrus Company has several\r\ndredges in successful operation. One is 102 feet long, 36 feet wide,\r\nand draws 36 inches of water. It is very substantially made, and\r\nweighs nearly 700,000 pounds. Before such a dredge is launched, a dam\r\nis built across the gulch to impound sufficient water. As the gravel\r\nis dredged and washed, it is dumped astern of the dredge, which, in\r\nthe case of a shallow creek, moves up to the excavation made by the\r\nbuckets. The boilers of this dredge are double, and together have 250\r\nH.P. There are 36 buckets, and each one has a horizontal drag of\r\neight feet, a capacity of five cubic feet, and travels at the rate of\r\nfourteen feet a minute. After treatment by trommels, or revolving\r\nscreens, coppers, and sluices, and finally by a centrifugal pump, the\r\nnow almost valueless gravel goes overboard again, leaving behind 98\r\nper cent. of the gold it once held.\r\n\r\nThe traction dredge is really a land-mining machine, as it is adapted\r\nfor work on land nearly flat, where but little water is obtainable.\r\nThe machine travels on bogie tracks. A 50-H.P. boiler supplies the\r\nwater. A boom, 40 feet long, carries a shovel of 1.5 cubic yards'\r\ncapacity, and moves 70 cubic yards each hour.\r\n\r\nMr. John W. Gray, one of the best authorities, has recently written to\r\nthe Mining and Scientific Press of San Francisco a most interesting\r\ndescription of the progress made in saving the gold from the streams\r\nin New Zealand. He says, in part:\r\n\r\n\"After great effort, numerous trials, many failures and some large\r\nlosses, this system of gaining gold has been evolved from crude\r\nbeginnings into a systematic and satisfactory method of mining.\r\nDredging for gold is now attracting attention and bids fair to become\r\nan established form of mining for that metal. In New Zealand, where\r\nmore work of this nature has been done than elsewhere, the evolution\r\nof the industry has been the work of years. The rivers upon which\r\ndredging operations are carried on are swift-flowing streams, subject\r\nto frequent floods, having a considerable depth of gravel, with\r\nboulders and runs of pay dirt interstratified. The conditions are,\r\ntherefore, not the best for economical and successful work, and it is\r\nnot surprising that many failures have occurred. The runs of gold are,\r\nhowever, often extensive and rich, and operations carried on upon such\r\nreaches have in a number of cases given satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n\"The improved form of dredge is a double pontoon, with ladder and\r\nchain-bucket arrangement between. Screens separate the coarse from the\r\nfine material. Wide sluicing tables catch the gold, centrifugal pumps\r\nsupply the water, and waste material is handled by elevators. The\r\npower is usually steam, although electricity is used in a few\r\ninstances, where conditions are favorable. The dredges vary in size\r\nand capacity, but are now built of large size and great strength.\r\nTwenty thousand dollars is the cost of a large dredge with all the\r\nlatest contrivances. Under favorable conditions, material has been\r\nhandled without loss that only yielded a grain of gold to the cubic\r\nyard. The real cost in actual continued working is believed to be very\r\nmuch in excess of that figure where average conditions exist.\r\n\r\n\"One dredge on the Clyde side of the Shotover, working to a depth of\r\ntwenty feet below water level, lifted 40 tons per hour when operating.\r\nThe profit on eleven dredges for the four weeks ending July 24, 1897,\r\nwas an average of $2,686 for each dredge.\r\n\r\n\"So far in this country (United States), with a few exceptions,\r\ndredging operations for gold have not been financially successful.\r\nFrom crude beginnings, however, the machines have been rapidly\r\nimproved and perfected, until now, in some localities, dredges\r\nbelieved to be the most complete yet constructed are being put in\r\noperation, and results are promised, not yet attained, in the way of\r\neconomical working and high percentage of saving. During the last few\r\nyears, a number of dredges have been operated in California, British\r\nColumbia, Idaho, Montana and Colorado, but with poor success. Very few\r\nprove themselves capable of paying their way. Some of the machines\r\nwere faulty within themselves, others were entirely unable to cope\r\nwith the swift currents and large boulders of the streams upon which\r\nthey were operated. This latter is said to have notably proved the\r\ncase with the dredges tried upon the Frazer and Ouesenelle rivers.\r\n\r\n\"Dredging operations on Grasshopper Creek, near Bannack, Mont., are\r\nnow carried on successfully upon a large scale. The upper Sacramento\r\nriver, in this state, has a dredge doing profitable work, and, in a\r\nsmall way, dredging is successful upon the Kzamath. A dredge upon that\r\nriver, composed of two flat boats with a large steel scoop between, is\r\nable to cut and hoist the gravel and soft bed rock, and to handle\r\nboulders of from four to six tons' weight. The dredge is run day and\r\nnight, has a 25-H.P. engine, and requires three men for each shift.\r\nIn gravel 10 to 25 feet deep, 400 cubic yards can be handled every\r\ntwenty-four hours. Cost of dredge, $8,000.\r\n\r\n\"A large dredge of the chain-bucket variety is operating in Northern\r\nMexico, in a dry country, where there is little water. The actual\r\ncapacities of these machines are 60, 100 and 150 yards per hour.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the most interesting dredge yet brought to the notice of the\r\npublic is one lately built by the Risdon Iron Works, San Francisco,\r\nand now operating upon the Yuba river, near Smartsville, Cal. It is of\r\nthe elevator, or chain-bucket, type, 96 feet long, composed of two\r\npontoons, separated by a space five feet in width, in which is\r\noperated the ladder carrying the buckets. One man controls the dredge\r\nby means of a power winch with six drums. Four drums carry lines from\r\nthe corners of the dredge to anchorages on shore--one a head-line and\r\none the ladder line. The machine is to dredge to a depth of 45 feet,\r\nand is said to have a gross capacity of 93 cubic yards per hour. The\r\nmaterial discharges from the buckets into a revolving and perforated\r\nscreen. This segregates the large material, which is then conveyed\r\naway by the tailings elevator. Water (3,000 gallons per minute) is\r\nsupplied to the revolving screen for washing and sluicing purposes by\r\na centrifugal pump, and the fine stuff falls through the holes in the\r\nscreen into a distributing box, from which it passes to a set of\r\ngold-saving tables and thence to a flume. The tables are covered with\r\ncocoa matting and expanded metal. The top tumbler of bucket-chain is\r\noperated by a vertical compound condensing engine indicating 35 H.P.,\r\nwhich also operates the pump. It is claimed for this dredge that in\r\nany ground not deeper than 60 feet below water level or more than 20\r\nfeet above, and which contains boulders of not more than one ton\r\nweight, the material can be handled at from 3 to 5 cents per cubic\r\nyard. If the capacity of the machine is given without deduction for\r\nwater raised, imperfect filling and general delays, and the increase\r\nin volume of the gravel when broken up in filling the buckets, the\r\nactual working capacity would be less, and from these causes and the\r\nlosses from wear and tear, breakages and repairs, the cost of\r\noperating would be increased. The cost of the dredge complete upon the\r\nriver is said to have been $25,000.\r\n\r\n\"In the evolution of the dredge into the elevator or chain-bucket\r\nmachine, now the popular form, the various kinds of dredges were given\r\ntrials. The dipper dredge is not adapted to dredging for gold, and\r\nsome of the gold is lost. With agitation of the gravel the gold soon\r\nsettles and is not recovered. It is also very difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, to construct a dipper dredge that is water-tight. Another\r\nobjection is that the material is supplied intermittently, thus making\r\nnecessary certain undesirable arrangements for supplying the material\r\nin a continuous flow to the gold-saving tables. The same objections\r\napply with greater force to the clam-shell form of dredge. It is by no\r\nmeans water-tight, and loses most of the gold in the act of dredging\r\nand bringing up the gravel. The objections would seem not to have the\r\nsame force if applied to hard cemented gravel or to gravel with\r\nsufficient clay or other binding material to make it consistent. It is\r\nwell to remember that these forms of dredges are, in many positions,\r\neconomical of operation.\r\n\r\n\"The hydraulic dredge has had fair trials and proved a failure. Large\r\nstorms greatly lessen the efficiency of this form of dredge, and\r\nnumerous boulders hamper the pumping work. The suction force, being\r\nintense near the pipe and decreasing rapidly a short distance away,\r\ncauses the sand and gravel to be carried off, leaving the gold behind.\r\nA centrifugal pump is therefore of little use to catch coarse gold, or\r\nto clear a hard, uneven bottom. Cutters do not remove the trouble,\r\nsince the gravel is dispersed by the cutting, and the gold is\r\nseparated therefrom.\r\n\r\n\"These objections would not obtain under certain conditions, and it\r\nwould seem quite possible that conditions might be found existing\r\nwhere the suction dredges might be arranged to do good work. A\r\ndredging company is now constructing, at Seattle, two dredges of the\r\nsuction type to operate upon the Yukon river. This would indicate that\r\nthere are those who believe that deposits occur in and along that\r\nriver which can be successfully worked in this way.\r\n\r\n\"The chain-bucket machine, the popular form for operating under\r\naverage conditions, is a combination of the following elements: An\r\nexcavating apparatus which clears the bottom and handles the material\r\nwith little agitation and slowly and continuously delivers a regular\r\nquantity of gravel to the gold-saving appliances; revolving screen to\r\nreceive and wash the material and separate the coarse from the fine;\r\nan elevator or contrivance for carrying off the coarse gravel and\r\nstones; gold-saving arrangements, or tables, over which the fine\r\nmaterial passes and upon which the gold is caught; a pumping apparatus\r\nto supply water for washing and sluicing.\r\n\r\n\"The proper capacity of a machine seems to be regulated by the\r\ncapacity of the gold-saving appliances. The tables should be as wide\r\nas possible, with frequent drops, and the fine material should be\r\ndistributed over the tables in a thin film. The tables are covered\r\nwith plush or cocoa matting, and sufficient water supplied to keep the\r\nmaterial clear. The material should be supplied evenly, continuously,\r\nand regularly to the tables. Care and attention are required to catch\r\nthe fine gold. A disregard of the foregoing directions results in\r\ngreat loss, more particularly in the fine gold. Mechanical skill is\r\nrequired to properly design and construct a dredge, and the care of a\r\ncompetent mechanic is necessary to see that the machine is kept in\r\norder and economically operated. The saving of the gold, however, is\r\nwhat makes dredging operations a commercial success. A man skilled in\r\nthese matters should be in charge of running operations. Dredges\r\nshould be built of determined capacities, and should be designed to\r\nsuit the conditions under which they are to operate. Careful\r\nexamination and investigation of the ground to be worked should be\r\nmade beforehand, and the surrounding conditions studied, and it goes\r\nwithout saying that these matters require engineering skill and\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\"The field for dredging for gold seems large. Where the proper\r\nconditions exist, it is a system which commends itself, and which\r\ngives promise, in competent hands, of being an economical method of\r\nmining. There is probably a very large extent of country where\r\ndredging for gold will be carried on profitably. The ground need not\r\nbe in a river, if there is seepage water sufficient to float the\r\ndredge and supply clear water for the saving of the gold. Dredging\r\nrequires little water as compared with that required for sluicing and\r\nelevating, and this water can, in many dry localities, be supplied at\r\nsmall expense, where a supply for hydraulic work or elevating would\r\ncost a very large sum, or be impossible at any cost. Any power\r\nsuitable for driving the prime motors can be utilized to run the\r\ndredge. Indeed, it would seem as if a system of mining was about to be\r\nperfected which may make possible the profitable working of many\r\ndeposits not easy to be worked by other methods, and which may, in\r\nmany instances, solve problems regarding the successful working of\r\ndeposits which hitherto have seemed most perplexing and even\r\nimpossible of solution. Some doubt exists as to possible economical\r\ndredging operations under the water of torrential streams. The strong\r\ncurrents, the frequent floods, and many large boulders found in the\r\nchannels of such streams make the working of the machines difficult\r\nand costly. This would not be so much the case in the long stretches\r\nof less current, nor would it be so at all in the valley-like reaches\r\nin the lower portions of rich streams, nor in the wide, flat portions\r\nof country where the streams enter the plains.\"\r\n\r\nVery few gold-bearing lodes contain nothing but free gold; on the\r\ncontrary, they carry the bulk of their values in the form of\r\nsulphurets, having more or less gold incorporated, and even when the\r\ngold is native and free-milling at the surface, it is generally\r\nchanged into sulphurets as depth is gained. So the miner has to\r\nconsider methods of recovery more complicated and expensive than\r\nsimple amalgamation with mercury, for upon gold included in pyrites\r\nmercury has no effect. Titanic iron, hematite, and tungstate of iron\r\noften hold gold, or soft clay ores carry it in their midst, and such\r\ncombinations tax all the skill of the mining engineer merely to save a\r\nrespectable percentage of the assay value. Sometimes chlorination and\r\nsometimes cyanization are the measures tried, but supposing the\r\npreliminary treatment to have been by stamps in the battery,\r\nconcentrating is one of the main reliances of the mill man. The\r\nblanket table is undoubtedly the oldest type of concentrating machine,\r\nbut it is very inferior to modern inventions. Percussion tables often\r\ndo good work. In this system a sharp and frequently repeated blow is\r\ngiven the table, in such fashion as to make the heavy material\r\nseparate from the light. \"Shaking\" and \"rocking\" tables are favored in\r\nsome mills, and they give better results on fine gold than any of the\r\npreviously mentioned devices. But the best machine so far invented is\r\nthe Frue Vanner--an endless rubber band drawn over an inclined table,\r\nhaving both revolving and side motions. The lighter particles are\r\ncarried off by water, and the heavier collected in a trough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRUE VANNER.]\r\n\r\nVeins, lodes, or ledges, may be found in stratified or unstratified\r\nrocks, and in the former they generally cut the beds at an angle.\r\nVeins are bounded by walls. The rock in which a vein is found is a\r\ncountry rock. Smooth walls are called \"slickensides.\" The upper wall\r\nof an inclined vein is the hanging wall; the other the foot wall. A\r\nlayer of clay between the veins and wall is a selvage. A mass of rock\r\nenclosed in the vein is a horse. The vein stone, or gangue, is all\r\nthat part of a vein that is not mineral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FAULT.]\r\n\r\nThe throw of a fault in a vein is measured by the amount of vertical\r\ndisplacement. When the miner comes to a fault, he should follow the\r\ngreater angle in his attempt to recover the lode. For instance, on\r\nmining along A B to the line of fault X Y, the exploration will be\r\ncontinued downward, because the angle A B Y is greater than the angle\r\nA B X.\r\n\r\nMercury that has been \"sickened,\" that is to say, has lost its\r\nbrightness and power of amalgamating, may often be cured by washing\r\nwith an extremely weak solution of sulphuric acid and adding a little\r\nzinc.\r\n\r\nAs regards the comparative merits of chlorination and cyanization, it\r\nmay be said the one is the equal of the other. Under certain\r\nconditions, chlorine gives a higher percentage of gold; under others\r\nthe same may be said of cyanide. A description of either process would\r\nbe out of place, however, in a simple elementary work.\r\n\r\nHanded down through the centuries, the primitive arrastra is still\r\nuseful in certain contingencies. It is like a cider mill in its\r\nprinciple, and was probably suggested by recollections of that\r\nmachine, or else of the Spanish wine-press. A circular, shallow pit, a\r\ndozen feet or more in diameter, is first paved with hard, uncut stones\r\nof granite, basalt, or other hard rock. This pavement is a foot thick,\r\nand beneath it is a bed of puddled clay 6 inches deep. A vertical\r\nshaft with an arm, or arms, revolves in the center of the arrastra.\r\nGrinding blocks weighing 400, or perhaps even 1,000 pounds, are\r\nfastened to the arms by chains or rawhide strips. The forward part of\r\neach stone is raised a couple of inches off the floor. Mule, horse,\r\nwater or steam power may be used, the speed ranging from 4 to 18 turns\r\na minute.\r\n\r\nNothing can be simpler, less expensive, or save a greater proportion\r\nof the value in the ore than the arrastra. Its limited capacity is its\r\nworst fault. An arrastra 10 feet in diameter will treat 500 or 600\r\npounds of ore at a charge, and handle one ton a day of 24 hours. Ores\r\nthat were so poor they yielded nothing to the stamp mill have paid\r\nwell with the arrastra.\r\n\r\nThis humble device may be used to advantage, probably in some of the\r\npoorer gold-bearing cemented gravels of the Northwest. The ore should\r\nbe crushed to pigeon-egg size. Small quantities of mercury, about a\r\ntablespoonful to every five tons of gravel, has been found a\r\nsatisfactory proportion in California.\r\n\r\nIn a permanent arrastra a layer of neatly-dressed and pointed stones\r\nis laid in hydraulic cement. A fair-sized arrastra will require 50\r\npounds of quartz to charge it, and the material must be broken into\r\npigeon-egg size. After the machine has been started, and a little\r\nwater added from time to time, little else need to be done for four or\r\nfive hours, and this is perhaps one of the reasons for which it has\r\nalways been so favored in indolent Mexico. At this stage, the quartz\r\nand ore will be very finely pulverized, and water should be added\r\nuntil the pulp is as thin as cream. Quicksilver must now be added in\r\nthe proportion of 1-1/4 ounce for every supposed ounce of gold in the\r\nore being treated. Two hours' further grinding is given, and water\r\nthen admitted until the paste is quite thin, the speed of the arrastra\r\nbeing reduced at the same time so as to allow the amalgam and\r\nquicksilver to sink to the bottom. A half an hour of this treatment\r\nsuffices and the thin mud is run off, leaving the gold and amalgam on\r\nthe floor of the arrastra. A second charge of broken quartz is put in\r\nand the operation repeated, the clean-up not taking place oftener than\r\nevery ten days, and sometimes only at intervals of a month or so. The\r\nrougher the bottom the longer the interval between clean-ups, as all\r\nthe stone work must be taken up each time and all the sand and mud\r\nbetween them must be washed carefully. The arrastra is extremely\r\nvaluable to the poor man who, having discovered a gold-bearing vein,\r\nwishes to transfer some of the metal into his own pocket, at the least\r\npossible outlay. Its cheapness places it within reach of all, while a\r\nstamp will cost a good deal. Then again the amalgamation being more\r\nperfect in the arrastra than in any other mill, it is particularly\r\nsuited for the poor, lean ores. It is, however, only adapted to those\r\nthat are free-milling, others not being suited to this form of\r\napparatus, nor, indeed, to any save very costly plants. Some arrastras\r\nhave been built to treat old tailings, and have paid well when water\r\npower could be used. Free-milling gold and high-grade silver and gold\r\nores are those usually treated.\r\n\r\nThe flagging should be of tough, coarse rock; granite, basalt or\r\ncompact quartz are all good. This flagging should be at the very least\r\na foot thick. When the arms of a 10-foot arrastra are revolving 14\r\ntimes a minute, the outer stone is traveling 400 feet a minute. Round\r\nholes closed by wooden plugs, or a side gate, lets the liquid mud out.\r\nSome mill men use chemicals in the arrastra; potassium cyanide, and\r\nwood ashes or lye are probably the most useful, as the latter cuts\r\ngrease and the former gives life to the quicksilver. Rich silver ores\r\nare treated with blue stone and salt. When the pulp has been ground\r\nsufficiently, quicksilver is added, sometimes 250 pounds being put in\r\na single charge. A 12-foot arrastra will never treat more than two\r\ntons a day, and often no more than one-half that. One man a shift can\r\nlook after a couple of arrastras, and the owner, in case of one\r\narrastra that is working on tailings, often does everything himself.\r\nOvershot wheels, or turbines, or hurdy-gurdies, furnish the power in\r\nmany cases. A simple mule-power arrastra may be built for $150.\r\n\r\nA side hill should be chosen for the site of a battery. Ample water\r\npower is necessary, though provision may be made for saving it in\r\ncatch basins should such a course be desired. Moreover, there must be\r\nplenty of room below the mill for the tailings, as it may be desirable\r\nat some future time to put them through a second course of treatment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STAMP BATTERY.]\r\n\r\nAutomatic ore-feeders are always put in by good mill men. In cold\r\nclimates the water that goes through the mill should be heated, and\r\nthis may be done by the exhaust steam, but care is necessary that no\r\ngrease get into it, as it would prevent the gold from amalgamating.\r\nThe stamps for a light mill may be 3 or 5 in number, and weigh from\r\n700 to 850 pounds. Tables must be water-tight, with half an inch to\r\none inch drop to the foot, according to the fineness of the gold.\r\nBelow them tables, having the same inclination and covered with\r\nblanketing, are used to retain specks of gold that have passed over\r\nthe plates without amalgamating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE STAMP BATTERY.]\r\n\r\nAfter the concentrated materials, always spoken of as the\r\nconcentrates, have passed over the tables, they are often roasted to\r\nget rid of the sulphur, arsenic, etc., and afterwards treated with\r\nquicksilver in the pan, or tin, with chlorine or cyanide. These\r\nprocesses belong, however, to the domain of the professional chemist\r\nand metallurgist, and require the knowledge and experience of an\r\nexpert to stand a chance of success.\r\n\r\nThe coarseness of the mortar screens is subject to infinite variety,\r\naccording to individual preference. The number of holes to the square\r\ninch ranges between 60 and 800 in Australia, and between 900 and\r\n10,000 in the United States. The holes, when round, agree in numbers\r\nwith those of sewing-machine needles, from 0 to 10. When slots are\r\npreferred to holes, they are generally 3/8-inch in length and No. 6\r\ndiameter. Russia sheet iron, or sheet steel 1/32-inch thick is the\r\nmaterial of which they are made. It should weigh one pound to the\r\nsquare foot, be very soft and tough, have a clean, smooth surface, and\r\nshow no rust or flaws. In Australia 1/16 sheet copper is preferred.\r\nThe holes in any case must be punched in the sheet so that the rough\r\nedges are turned, and thus any pulp that finds its way into one of the\r\nholes is certain to get out again and not clog. A battery may require\r\n13 sets of screens a year; each screen having a surface of about 1-1/2\r\nsquare feet. Russia iron screens endure 15 to 40 days. As the work a\r\nstamp can do depends entirely upon how much pulp can escape through\r\nthe screen in any given time, the latter is evidently a very important\r\ndetail of a battery.\r\n\r\nProspecting stamp batteries differ from ordinary batteries, chiefly in\r\nbeing of light build and weight.\r\n\r\nAmalgam coming from battery stamps is often mixed with all sorts of\r\nrubbish. After being gathered, it is dried with a sponge, foreign\r\nmatter picked off the surface and clean quicksilver added. Soft\r\nunglazed paper thrust into the mercury removes the last vestiges of\r\nwater, and then a card is drawn vertically or a piece of blanket\r\nhorizontally across the mercury to clean it of iron. After squeezing,\r\nthe amalgam is retorted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLD RETORT.]\r\n\r\nAll the amalgam is placed in one large kettle and, if possible, the\r\nlatter is put on a strong table having an inclined surface with a\r\ngroove and hole at the lower end to catch any stray globules of\r\nquicksilver. Sodium amalgam, one ounce to each 75 pounds of mercury,\r\nis put in the amalgam kettle and the whole stirred. This sodium\r\namalgam is not absolutely necessary, but is desirable. After some\r\nminutes, water is poured on the mercury and the whole stirred. All\r\ndirt rises to the surface and is removed with a sponge. The cleaning\r\nis continued until the mercury seems absolutely free from any\r\nimpurity, when it is dried with a sponge. It is next turned into\r\npointed bags of stout canvas and force applied until most of the\r\nquicksilver has squeezed through. The amalgam remains behind. The\r\nquicksilver still contains some gold, but it had better remain if the\r\nmercury is to be used again, as gold attracts gold; it can always be\r\nrecovered by retorting.\r\n\r\nSodium amalgam is best made by the miner himself, enough for one\r\nclean-up at a time. Metallic sodium and quicksilver are the necessary\r\ningredients; the former being kept in a wide-mouthed bottle covered\r\nwith coal oil. A frying-pan makes a useful mixer. It must be dry and\r\nclean. Five pounds of clean mercury is poured into the pan, and dried\r\nwith a sponge, and heated beyond the boiling-point of water, but not\r\nmuch above, or there will be a sensible loss of mercury. A piece of\r\nsodium is wiped dry, cut into 1/2-inch squares and placed with a long\r\npair of tongs in the center of the warm quicksilver, which, by the\r\nway, is now off the fire and in the open air, the operator meanwhile\r\nkeeping religiously to windward of it, unless he courts salivation and\r\nall its attendant ills. As soon as the sodium touches the mercury a\r\nflash and mild explosion will follow, but after a few cubes have been\r\nintroduced into the frying-pan, always in the center, this will cease.\r\nAs soon as a solid mass of amalgam forms in the middle of the pan, the\r\ncontents must be stirred slowly, and a little more sodium added. The\r\nwhole mass now crystallizes out, and if put into closely-stopped\r\nbottles it will keep without further protection for a little time.\r\nOnce opened, each bottle must be used. Observe all these directions\r\nfaithfully, then there will be no danger of inhaling mercurial fumes\r\nnor of being blown to atoms. After the amalgam is once made, it is\r\nsafe as sugar.\r\n\r\nIn retorting amalgam never fill the flask too full, and apply the heat\r\ngradually, and always from the top of the flask downward.\r\n\r\nThe rocker is a box 40 inches long, 16 inches wide on the bottom,\r\nsloped like a cradle, and with rockers at each end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSS SECTION OF ROCKER.]\r\n\r\nA hopper 20 inches square and 4 inches deep, having an iron bottom\r\nperforated with 1/2-inch holes, occupies the top. A light\r\ncanvas-covered frame is stretched under this, forming a riffle.\r\nRiffles, and occasionally amalgamated copper plates, are placed in the\r\nbottom. The gravel is fed into the hopper, the cradle being then\r\nrocked by one hand while water is fed by a dipper with the other.\r\n\r\nThe cradle must be placed on an inclination while being worked, and\r\nunder the influence of the continued side-to-side rocking the dirt is\r\nquickly disintegrated, passes through the riddle and falls on the\r\napron. From the apron it is conveyed to the inner end of the cradle\r\nfloor, from which it flows over the riffles, or bars, and out at the\r\nmouth. The difference in level of the floor is generally about 2-1/2\r\ninches, but this may be varied according to the nature of the dirt\r\ntreated. Large stones in the riddle or hopper must be thrown out, but\r\nsmaller ones assist in breaking up the lumps of dirt. Every little\r\nwhile the pebbles are turned out and looked over for nuggets.\r\nClean-ups are necessary two or three times a day. The hopper is taken\r\noff first, then the apron is slid out, and washed in a bucket or tub\r\ncontaining clean water, and finally the gold and amalgam are collected\r\nin an iron spoon from behind the riffle bars, and panned out. Gravel\r\nrequires at least three times its own weight of water to wash it. The\r\nmost convenient way is to lead the water from a stream through a pipe\r\ndischarging directly over the hopper, but this is, of course,\r\nimpracticable in some places. More often the water is led to a little\r\npit on the right hand side of the operator, from which he ladles it up\r\nas required. One man can wash from one to three cubic yards daily\r\naccording to the character of the dirt, but every time he stops the\r\nmachine to feed it with gravel or to empty the riddle, the sand will\r\npack, and must be removed before washing can go on. Two men can wash\r\nnearly three times as much dirt in a day as one man. But in any case,\r\nthe rocker is only a primitive machine, having a capacity but\r\none-fifth as great as that of the Long Tom, and but one-tenth that of\r\na very poor sluice, but as it is cheap, requires but little water, and\r\nsaves a high percentage of coarse gold, the rocker will continue to be\r\nused in many districts.\r\n\r\nThe Long Tom was invented many years ago by Georgia miners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONG TOM.]\r\n\r\nIt is a trough 12 feet by 15 to 20 inches at the upper end, and 30\r\ninches at the lower, and 8 inches deep. The grade is usually 1 in 12.\r\nA sheet iron plate forms the lower end of the trough. These figures\r\nrefer to the upper trough. The lower or riffle-box is 12 feet long by\r\n3 feet wide, with a fall equal to that of the trough and a sufficient\r\ndepth to keep the material and water from spilling over the sides. It\r\nshould have four riffles. For this means of saving the gold, to work\r\nsatisfactorily, the metal must be coarse and the water plentiful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLUICE BOXES.]\r\n\r\nEvery sluice is an inclined channel through which flows a stream of\r\nwater, carrying away all the lighter matter thrown into it, and\r\nseparating it from the heavy. When the operations would not be\r\npermanent enough, or sometimes for other reasons, a ground sluice is\r\npreferred to the ordinary box sluice made of boards. Ground sluicing\r\nrequires, however, six times as much water as does a box sluice to do\r\nthe same amount of work. It is simply a gutter in the bed rock, and if\r\nthe bottom is hard and uneven its inequalities will arrest the gold;\r\nif not, a number of boulders too heavy to be moved by the stream are\r\nput into the sluice to act as riffles. No mercury is used. The water\r\nis turned off and the collected coarse gold washed in the pan.\r\n\r\nSluice boxes may be any length, from 30 to 5,000 feet. They vary in\r\nwidth from 1 to 5 feet, though generally 16 or 18 inches. The grade is\r\nproportioned to the fineness of the gold, varying from 8 inches to 2\r\nfeet to the 12-foot box or length. The bottom should be of 1-1/2 inch\r\nplank, and the sides of 1-inch boards. The boxes are made 4 inches\r\nwider at the upper end than at the lower, so as to telescope.\r\n\r\nThe best method found yet for arresting fine gold is the copper plate\r\namalgamated with mercury on its face. These plates are never used at\r\nthe head of a sluice or other situation where there is much coarse\r\ngold, as they would be superfluous in such a situation, but are placed\r\nsome distance down the sluice and are most efficacious in arresting\r\nthe \"flour,\" or excessively fine gold. Plates are always of copper\r\nabove 1/16 inch thick, and may be 6 feet or more long, and of a width\r\nsuited to the capacity of the sluice. When treated with quicksilver,\r\nthey become as brittle as glass, and must be handled with care. The\r\ncopper plate is first washed with a weak solution of nitric acid, and\r\nthen mercury that has been treated with a weak nitric acid solution is\r\nrubbed on the plate. As this surface of quicksilver wears off, it may\r\nbe replaced by a little fresh mercury. Any green slime on a plate is\r\nan evidence of copper salts in the water. It must be scraped off and\r\nthe spot rubbed with fresh quicksilver. Gold attracts gold, therefore\r\nthe plates should not be cleaned up too often.\r\n\r\nCopper plates may be freed from gold by heating them over a fire and\r\ncausing the quicksilver to evaporate slowly. The plates, after being\r\ncooled, are rubbed with dilute muriatic acid and covered with damp\r\ncloths for one night. They are then rubbed with a solution containing\r\nsalt peter and sal ammoniac, and once more heated over some hot coals,\r\nbut not allowed to get red hot. Soon the gold scale rises in blisters;\r\nthe plates are then removed from the fire and scraped. Those parts of\r\nthe plates that have not yielded up their gold must be re-treated and\r\nfired until they do so. All these scales of gold are then collected in\r\na porcelain dish, the base metals are dissolved out with nitric acid,\r\nand the gold is then smelted. Corrosive sublimate should be placed in\r\nthe crucible as long as any blue flame is seen to come from it.\r\n\r\nSome mill men prefer to amalgamate their copper plates with silver\r\namalgam, claiming that silver-coated plates save a higher percentage\r\nof gold. To amalgamate in this way take some silver bullion, or silver\r\ncoin, and dissolve in weak nitric acid, only just strong enough to act\r\nupon the silver. (If you use too much nitric acid you will waste\r\nmercury and make the amalgam harder than it should be for the best\r\nresults.) After crystals have formed, quicksilver must be added,\r\nheating gently meanwhile, until a thick, pasty amalgam has formed. Let\r\nthis new compound stand for some hours, and squeeze through chamois as\r\nusual. The proportion of silver may be about 1 ounce to the square\r\nfoot of copper to be plated.\r\n\r\nIn facing new copper plates with this amalgam, they should be washed\r\nfirst with dilute nitric acid; then in clear water; the ball of\r\namalgam being rubbed over their surfaces, some little force being\r\napplied. Plates should not be used for 24 hours after coating. Porous\r\ncopper plates of the best quality, and not too heavily rolled, should\r\nbe used. Follow the amalgam with a swab, and rub the alloy well into\r\nthe plate.\r\n\r\nZinc amalgam (preferable when mine water containing sulphuric acid is\r\nused in the battery) is applied to the plate after it has been cleaned\r\nwith a moderately dilute mixture of sulphuric acid and water. The\r\nzinc-quicksilver ball is rubbed in and applied while the plate is\r\nstill wet. Zinc amalgam is prepared as follows: Cut zinc-sheet into\r\nsmall pieces; wash in weak sulphuric acid; and dissolve in mercury.\r\nWhen the quicksilver will take no more zinc, squeeze through chamois\r\nand rub in. Zinc-coated plates should stand a week before being used.\r\nVery weak sulphuric acid will always clean these plates of any scum\r\nthat may form before they have received a gold coat.\r\n\r\nSometimes the miner will be troubled with impure gold after retorting.\r\nIf the metal is very dark this shade may come from the presence of\r\nlarge amounts of iron. A heavy proportion of mineral salts, such as\r\nchloride of calcium (CaCl), sodium (NaCl), and magnesium (NgCl{2}),\r\nin the battery water sometimes accounts for this. In such cases\r\namalgamate, retort, pulverize and roast. Then smelt with borax, the\r\niron passing into the slag. If necessary smelt a second time, when the\r\ngold should be pure enough to dispose of. In extreme cases, the gold\r\nmay weigh but one-fifth of the amalgam treated.\r\n\r\nIn districts where sufficient water for sluicing is not procurable,\r\ndry washing is resorted to. Nothing but rich, coarse gold can be\r\nworked by this method, and the dry washer rarely delves far below the\r\nsurface for his gold. In the Mexican deserts the dirt is laid on raw\r\nhide, all the large pebbles picked out and the sand rubbed as fine as\r\npossible between the hands. The sand is placed in a batea and winnowed\r\nby tossing in the air, the lighter material being blown to leaward and\r\nthe heavy gold falling into the batea. A form of winnowing machine has\r\nbeen patented, which may be driven by horse or hand-power, which is\r\nsaid to give satisfaction. It works by forcing a strong blast of air\r\nfrom a fan through a canvas screen. The inventor claims that it will\r\ndo the work of three men, and work dirt for 2-1/2 cents a cubic yard.\r\nWhen there is a tendency in the material to cake, dry washing is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCAMP LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indian truthfully observes: \"White man make heap big fire; keep\r\nfar off. Indian make little fire; get close. All same.\" The small fire\r\ndoes best in the circular tepee tent, made of canvas or leather, in\r\nuse on the plains. The tepee is quite an institution, but it is\r\ngenerally as full of smoke as a kitchen chimney, and for that reason\r\ncannot truthfully be recommended. In theory, the smoke should all pass\r\nout of the opening in the top.\r\n\r\nBy using no second skin and carefully excluding all air from around\r\nthe lower rim of the tepee, it will become an admirable place to cure\r\nhams, fish, etc., by the original smoke-dried process. The Scripture\r\ndeclares that he that tarrieth over the wine cup has red eyes next\r\nmorning, and so has he that sleeps in a smoky tepee. Properly made,\r\nhowever, the tepee is the thing where wood is scarce.\r\n\r\nSome original spirits are said to have started for Dawson City,\r\nN.W.T., a few years ago with bicycles and push carts. If these means\r\nof transport had sufficed, the world would have learnt something, as\r\nheretofore a canoe and a sturdy pair of legs were supposed to help the\r\nwayfarer in that region better than anything else. That is in summer;\r\nin winter, the dog-train is the quickest mode of travel. In the\r\nwestern states and in British Columbia pack horses or mules do the\r\nmost of the prospector's freighting, and in the far north he either\r\ncarries his outfit on his back or else transports it by canoe in\r\nsummer, or by dog-train after the rivers have frozen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUDSON'S BAY DOG SLED.]\r\n\r\nNo amount of written instructions will teach a man to throw a diamond\r\nhitch, or handle a canoe in swift water. A lesson or two from an\r\nexpert will, however, set his thoughts in the right direction, and in\r\ntime he may become proficient. Canoeing, freighting and chopping are\r\nthree things that are best begun in boyhood; no one ever yet became\r\nmarvelously proficient in any one of them that began after reaching\r\nadult age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YUKON SLED AND HARNESS.]\r\n\r\nDog teams are made up of from three to six dogs; a full-sized team\r\ndragging a load of 200 pounds forty miles a day for a week at a time.\r\nIn the Hudson Bay region the dogs are harnessed one behind the other,\r\nbut on the Yukon each pulls by a separate trace, and the team spreads\r\nout like a fan when at work.\r\n\r\nAfter Christmas the snow-shoe is generally a necessity in the north.\r\nWithout \"paddles\" on the feet the explorer could hardly make his way\r\nthrough the woods, while with them on he sails along gayly, making a\r\nbee-line over frozen lake and water courses, and taking windfalls and\r\ndown timber in his stride. The shoe in vogue in the forest is short\r\nand almost round, and flat, while that of the plains is very long,\r\nupturned at the toe, and narrow. There is a reason for these\r\nmodifications, as the tyro will soon find out should he substitute the\r\none for the other in the native habitat of either. But the loop by\r\nwhich the shoe is fastened on the foot is always the same. The string\r\nis made of moose hide; stretched, and greased before use. Caribou, or\r\nreindeer hide, makes the best filling, but horse or bull hide will do\r\nat a pinch. The frame is usually of ground ash, or some other tough,\r\nhard wood.\r\n\r\nA camp kit of cooking utensils often begins and ends with a frying-pan\r\nand tin kettle. Certainly when traveling light, these things should be\r\nthe last to go, as with them all things are possible, even to\r\namalgamating and retorting the precious metals. The frying-pan must\r\nhave a socket instead of a long handle, as the latter may be cut from\r\na bush at any time. A low, broad kettle boils in less time than a\r\ndeep, narrow one of the same cubic capacity.\r\n\r\nAll provisions should be kept in canvas bags. Matches in a leather\r\ncase or safe, or in a corked bottle. Blankets are never kicked off if\r\nsewn up at foot and side into a sleeping bag.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the prospector being passed in regions where the\r\nso-called benefits of civilization have not penetrated, he is\r\ngenerally a healthy, happy, hopeful man. Especially, hopeful. I do not\r\nremember ever meeting one that was not brimful of expectation and\r\ntrust in the future. Possibly prospectors that have become pessimistic\r\ndrop out of the ranks.\r\n\r\nNow the man who elects to dwell with nature has only himself to thank\r\nif he does not like his lodgings. He can be comfortable or wretched,\r\naccording to his knowledge of woodcraft and wilderness residence.\r\n\r\nWhereas the tyro starts out with the avowed intention of \"roughing\r\nit,\" the veteran is particularly careful to take matters as smoothly\r\nas he may, being well assured that in any case there will be enough\r\ninevitable discomfort in his lot to satisfy any reasonable craving. It\r\nis just the same in other walks of life; the sailor, the trapper and\r\nthe soldier each learns to look after his own comfort and to seize\r\nevery opportunity of making life as pleasant as possible.\r\n\r\nThe three prime wants are food, clothing and shelter, and their\r\nimportance is in the order named. Now, food is something that is\r\npainfully scarce in many parts of the world, and one of the great\r\nproblems of wilderness travel is to provide transport for the supplies\r\nthat must be carried from civilization. A rigorous northern climate\r\nnecessitates a large consumption of strong, heat-producing food, while\r\nin the tropics the explorer gets along very comfortably with rice or\r\nan occasional skinny fowl, with plantains for dessert, and plenty of\r\nboiled and filtered water. Compare such a diet with that of Nansen,\r\nthe arctic explorer! He and his companion lived and waxed fat on a\r\ndiet of lean bear's meat three times a day, washed down by draughts of\r\nmelted snow water. Moreover, although government expeditions, provided\r\nwith every canned and potted luxury the stores contain, have suffered\r\nthe ravages of scurvy, these two adventurous Norwegians, living on the\r\nfood their rifles had provided, did not know what sickness meant.\r\n\r\nOther travelers have found that they fared better by copying to some\r\nextent the manner and customs of the natives. Fat seal blubber gives\r\nwonderful resisting power against cold, it is said; while a mild,\r\nunstimulating diet of rice suits the liver better under the Equator\r\nthan the Bass ale and roast beef galore.\r\n\r\nOn this continent the working man found out long ago that pork and\r\nbeans suits him nicely. The lumberman says: \"It sticks to the ribs,\"\r\nby which robust, if not classical, phrase he means that he can chop\r\nlonger without feeling hungry on pork and beans than on almost any\r\nother food. The laborer having found by experience that the side of a\r\npig and a sack of beans was a good combination to have in the larder,\r\nthe man of science after a couple of hundred years or so of\r\ndeliberation confirms the discovery by announcing that the flesh of a\r\nswine mixed with the fruit of the bean contains all the\r\ncarbo-hydrates, etc., necessary to sustain life. The moral of all this\r\nis that pork and beans must not be forgotten when outfitting. A few\r\nother things being desirable, the following list may be consulted to\r\nadvantage by the prospective prospector. This list should suffice for\r\nfeeding one man for 12 months:\r\n\r\n    Sugar                    75 pounds.\r\n    Apples (evaporated)      50 pounds.\r\n    Salt                     25 pounds.\r\n    Salt pork               212 pounds.\r\n    Pepper                     1 pound.\r\n    Condensed milk              1 case.\r\n    Flour                    2 barrels.\r\n    Candles                      1 box.\r\n    Matches                   12 boxes.\r\n    Soap                   1 doz. bars.\r\n    Tea                       1/2 case.\r\n    Beans                   200 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe dictates of fashion being unheard on the mountain side, and\r\nbeneath the pines, dress resolves itself into a mere question of\r\nwarmth and comfort. Cut is of importance truly, but only insomuch as\r\nit allows free play to the limbs; to the arms in digging, and to the\r\nlegs in climbing the stiff side of a canyon. Home-spun, heavy tanned\r\nduck, corduroy or moleskin, and flannel underclothing should be the\r\nmainstays of a miner's wardrobe. Rubber boots and slickers are also\r\nnecessary to his comfort, while for winter use a heavy Mackinaw\r\novercoat, or even fur, for the extreme north, is advisable. When\r\nactually at work the miner is more often in his shirt sleeves than\r\nnot, and cold indeed must the day be if an old woodsman is caught\r\ntraveling through the forest with his burly form encased in furs. For\r\narctic conditions akin to those found on the upper Yukon an outfit\r\nsuch as the following should be chosen:\r\n\r\n    2 heavy knitted undershirts.\r\n    2 flannel shirts.\r\n    6 pairs worsted socks.\r\n    2 pairs overstockings.\r\n    1 pair miner's boots.\r\n    1 pair gum boots.\r\n    2 pairs moccasins.\r\n    1 suit homespun.\r\n    1 horsehide jacket.\r\n    1 pair moleskin trousers.\r\n    1 broad-brimmed felt hat.\r\n    1 fur cap.\r\n    1 Mackinaw overcoat.\r\n    2 pairs flannel mitts.\r\n    1 pair fur mitts.\r\n    1 muffler.\r\n    1 suit oil slickers.\r\n    2 pairs blankets.\r\n\r\nIn cold weather the feet, fingers and face require the most care. The\r\nfirst should be stowed into two pairs of wool socks, and a long pair\r\nof knee-high oversocks be drawn over these. Boots must be replaced by\r\nmoccasins. A pair of thick worsted mitts, and a pair of leather mitts\r\noutside, keep the hands warm enough even at 20 degrees below zero. At\r\n50 degrees below put on an extra pair--or go home until the weather\r\nmoderates.\r\n\r\nThe favorite style of architecture in the wilderness is neither Doric\r\nnor the Gothic nor yet the Renaissance. It is called the dugout. The\r\nbeauty of the dugout is its extreme simplicity. A hole in the side of\r\na dry bank, a few sods or logs for roof, and there you have it. A\r\nveteran miner goes to earth as easily as a rabbit, and, like bunny, is\r\nnever at a loss for an habitation.\r\n\r\nNext to the dugout the log cabin deserves mention, while the wattle\r\nand daub or 'dobe certainly secures third honors. The only drawback to\r\nthe pre-eminence of the log cabin is that to make it you must have\r\nlogs--just as the cook always insists on pigeons before she makes\r\npigeon pie--and logs are in some districts only known as museum\r\nspecimens. Now, the dugout or the 'dobe only require a gravel bank, or\r\none of those deposits of argilite that the vulgar persist in calling\r\nclay; were it not for this fatal ease of getting, every miner and\r\nprospector would doubtless prefer living in a snug log hut, there to\r\nawait in peace, comfort, and dignity the arrival of the representative\r\nof the \"English syndicate\" to whom he is destined to sell his claim.\r\n\r\nNapoleon found, after fighting his way across Europe and back again,\r\nthat his troops were more healthy bivouacking in the open than\r\nsheltered in tents. In truth, the tent is a very uncomfortable and\r\nunhealthy make-shift; cold, hot, and damp, by turns, and often badly\r\nventilated. A simple lean-to shelter, and a roaring fire are\r\ninfinitely preferable where wood is abundant. But it takes a lot of\r\nwood to keep a bivouac warm on a winter's night; as much perhaps as\r\nwould feed a fair-sized family furnace for a month.\r\n\r\nThe trappers' fire is a most regal blaze. Two back logs; a pair of\r\n\"hand junks\" and a \"forestick\" are the foundation upon which the\r\nstructure is reared, but the edifice itself often consumes a tall,\r\nfull-limbed rock maple, or a stately birch between the setting of the\r\nsun and the rising of the same. There are three ways of making a fire;\r\nthe first is suited for a \"wooden\" country; the second is used by\r\n\"Lo,\" and other prairie travelers, where fuel is scarce.\r\n\r\nIf overtaken by storm in any wild northern region, do as the animals\r\nand Indians do under like circumstances: seek the nearest shelter and\r\nlie close until the weather has moderated. The secret is to conserve\r\nyour energy, not to fritter it away fighting a power against which you\r\nmay make no real headway. A shallow, brush-lined gully; the lea of a\r\nbank, or small clump of trees; these and other seemingly slight\r\nprotections sometimes mean life instead of death. The experienced\r\nwoodsman never leaves camp without matches in his pocket; and in\r\nwinter he carries a few pieces of dry birch bark in the bosom of his\r\nhunting shirt, as he knows how vitally necessary it is on occasions to\r\nbe able to kindle a blaze at very short notice.\r\n\r\nA tent should never be pitched loosely, as no matter how fine the\r\nevening the weather ere morning may be tempestuous in the extreme, and\r\nthe unpleasantness of having a tent come down about one's ears in the\r\ndark must be experienced to be realized. Also, never pitch a tent with\r\nthe doorway toward the northwest in winter, because that is the\r\nquarter from which comes the cold.\r\n\r\nIn summer, from June until mid-August, the mosquito, the black fly and\r\nthe midge or sand fly, make life a burden in the north. The best\r\nremedy for the mosquito and black fly is a mixture of tar and olive\r\noil, of the consistency of cream, rubbed on all exposed parts of the\r\nperson. A dark green veil will also keep the insect pests out of the\r\neyes, mouth and ears, and in winter is better than snow goggles to\r\navert blindness. But, unfortunately, it interferes with the enjoyment\r\nof the pipe, and hence is not in much favor with woodsmen.\r\n\r\nTo make good bread it is not necessary to take either yeast cakes or\r\nmixing pan into the wilderness. An old hand thinks himself rich with a\r\nfew pounds of flour in his sack, and soon has a batch of bread baking\r\nthat would turn many a housewife green with envy. He proceeds in this\r\nfashion: A visit to the nearest hardwood ridge shows him a green\r\nparasitic lichen growing on the bark of the maples (lungwort). Some of\r\nthis he gathers, and steeps it over night in warm water near the\r\nembers. In the morning he mixes his flour into a paste with this\r\ndecoction, using the bag as a pan. The dough is next covered with a\r\ncloth and set in a warm corner to rise; a few hours later it is\r\nre-kneaded and baked. The result should be delicious bread. Some of\r\nthe leaven, or raised dough, may be kept, and will suffice for the\r\nnext batch of bread, and so on ad infinitum.\r\n\r\nMaking bed takes longer in camp than in the city, but the result is\r\njust as satisfactory. Nothing more comforting than a couch of fir\r\nboughs has been devised by man. Choosing a level spot the woodsman\r\ncuts several armfuls of the feathery tips of the fir balsam. These he\r\nplaces in layers like shingles on a roof, beginning at the foot and\r\nlaying the butt of each bough toward the head. If sufficiently deep,\r\nsay a couple of feet or so, such a bed will be soft and elastic for a\r\nnight or two, when it will require re-laying. Fragrant it always is,\r\nwith the delicious aroma of the fir balsam.\r\n\r\nThe white man stretches himself instinctively feet to the fire; the\r\nIndian just as instinctively reclines with his side to it--and his way\r\nis the most philosophical.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, the greatest danger the wanderer runs is on\r\nhis return to civilization. Land surveyors, engineers, and others\r\nwhose work calls them into camp for months at a stretch, dread their\r\nfirst night in a feather bed. They find by experience that they are\r\nlucky if they escape with nothing more serious than a heavy cold. Hot,\r\nstuffy air, and poor ventilation cause the trouble. Leaving the window\r\nwide open will almost always prevent these evil consequences, and\r\nallow the constitution to become once more tolerant of a lack of\r\noxygen. In the wilderness, notwithstanding, wet, cold, and exposure,\r\nsuch ills as consumption, pneumonia, bronchitis, etc., are unheard of.\r\n\r\nBoat building and net making are two arts that the prospector will do\r\nwell to master. A few weeks passed in a building yard, and a half\r\ndozen lessons from an old fisherman will teach him all that he\r\nrequires of these simple but extremely useful accomplishments.\r\n\r\nThe best food for sustaining life in the north is pemmican. It was\r\nonce made out of buffalo meat, but now the flesh of the moose, or\r\ncaribou, or of the deer, is substituted. The meat is cut in thin\r\nflakes and air-dried; then a mixture is made of one-third dried meat,\r\none-third pure haunch fat, and one-third service berries (A.\r\ncanadensis). These are rammed by main force into a bag of green hide,\r\nand pounded until as solid as a rock. Such a solid mass of food will\r\nkeep for years in a cool climate.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reader may be inclined to exclaim: \"Why so much about the\r\nNorth; why not more about the East, South or West?\" My reply to such\r\nwould be: Because the great finds of the future will surely be made in\r\nthe North. Dr. G. W. Dawson, the best authority on the subject, has\r\nsaid there are 1,000,000 square miles of virgin territory in Canada\r\nto-day, and no doubt a very large proportion of it contains mineral\r\ndeposits. This 1,000,000 square miles he divides into sixteen separate\r\nareas, some half as large as Ireland, others half that of Europe, and\r\nin none of them has the footfall of a white man yet been echoed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSURVEYING.\r\n\r\n\r\nA man, to make a success of prospecting, must have what is known as \"a\r\ngood eye for a country.\" Given that faculty he will readily pick up\r\nthe little knowledge of surveying that is sometimes almost\r\nindispensable. A tape measure, and a prismatic or surveying compass,\r\nare all that he is likely to require in laying off to his own\r\nsatisfaction the extent of his claim, or any similar simple operation.\r\nThe surveying compass has two fixed sights, and a Jacob staff\r\nmounting, into which a wooden support is inserted. The north end of\r\nthe compass is always pointed ahead, while the needle, which of course\r\nindicates the magnetic north, gives the bearing of the line run toward\r\nthat north. Now, magnetic north is not by any means the same thing as\r\ntrue north, in fact in very few localities on the earth's surface are\r\nthey the same, and then never for long. In the extreme east of the\r\nUnited States the needle points some twenty degrees to the west of\r\ntrue north, and in Alaska it points thirty-five degrees to the\r\neastward of it. There is therefore one meridian somewhere in the\r\ncentral valley where the true north corresponds with the magnetic\r\nnorth, but as the magnetic pole is always shifting this never remains\r\ntrue of the same meridian for long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SURVEYING COMPASS.]\r\n\r\nWhen there is no local magnetism from iron ores, or rocks containing\r\nmagnetite, the needle is fairly reliable, though never perfectly\r\naccurate, but when such attraction exists the compass is\r\nunsatisfactory. Such areas of attraction, however, are usually\r\nlimited, and by squinting back, taking what is known as a \"back\r\nsight,\" a local attraction may be detected, and in that case ranging\r\nby rods must be resorted to until the compass needle once more seeks\r\nits true position. To range by rods the course of the line having been\r\ndetermined by retracing the route followed to the last reliable mark,\r\na stake is driven in at that point, and the surveyor standing some\r\nlittle distance behind it on the correct line directs an assistant to\r\nplace another rod in such a position that the first hides it from\r\nview. It will then be on a prolongation of the line, and this\r\noperation being continued the surveyor will, in due time, find himself\r\nbeyond the reach of the local attraction that deflected his needle and\r\ncan resume compass work.\r\n\r\nA chain is 66 feet long. Oftentimes in mountainous or brush-covered\r\ncountries a half chain of 33 feet, made of light wire links, is\r\npreferred. Two men do the chaining, which could of course be done by\r\nmeans of an ordinary tape measure in an emergency, the leader carrying\r\nten pins of iron or wood, and the rear man taking one up as each chain\r\nis measured off. When all are used, ten chains (1/8 mile) have been\r\ncovered. The men exchange pins and the tally man, usually the hind\r\nchainman, calls out \"Tally one,\" and cuts a notch in a stick. Careful\r\nchaining is the essence of good surveying. The chain must always be\r\nkept horizontal, or else an allowance made for the inclination at\r\nwhich it was held when the measurement was taken, otherwise the\r\nresults will be misleading, for all surveyors' measurements of areas\r\nare theoretically on a flat surface.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the height of a tree, tower, etc., fold a square of paper\r\nacross, and glancing along the hypothenuse (longest side) of the right\r\nangle so found, ascertain at what point your line of sight just\r\ncatches the top of the object. Then its height is the same distance as\r\nthe distance from where you stand to its foot, or the length of a\r\nplumb line falling from its summit, together with the height of your\r\neye above the ground, added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnother method is to measure the shadow of the object on a level\r\nsurface, next measure your own. Then\r\n\r\nAs your shadow is to your height so is the shadow of the object to\r\nits height.\r\n\r\nThe area of a square is equal to the square of one of its sides.\r\n\r\nThe area of a triangle is equal to the base multiplied by half the\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nThe areas of figures containing more than three sides may always be\r\nfound by resolving such figures into a series of right angled\r\ntriangles.\r\n\r\nVery frequently the surveyor is called upon to measure an inaccessible\r\nline. There are many ways of solving such a problem, but one of the\r\nsimplest is as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSupposing the required distance is that from bank to bank of a river\r\n(Y-X). Then lay off the base line Y-M, driving stakes at each end;\r\nmake M-P at right angles to Y-M. Sight from P to X, and drive in a\r\nstake at Z. Then:\r\n\r\n    Z M : M P :: Z Y : Y X.\r\n\r\nWhile these simple surveying problems are easily solved, the\r\nprospector should never forget that mine surveying requires skill,\r\nexperience and accuracy. He will do well always to call in the service\r\nof a mining engineer should his \"prospect\" ever become a full-fledged\r\nmine, as little errors of direction are particularly costly mistakes\r\nwhen they occur underground.\r\n\r\nShould you wish to lay off a certain acreage as a square, proceed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nAs there are ten square chains to one acre, multiply the content in\r\nacres by 10 to reduce to square chains. Then find the square root of\r\nthis number of square chains, and that will be the length of a side of\r\nthe square required. For instance:\r\n\r\nTo lay off 25 acres as a square:\r\n\r\n25 times 10 equals 250 square chains.\r\n\r\nWhose square root is 15.81.\r\n\r\nAns. The plot must be 15 chains 81 links square.\r\n\r\nSeventy average paces is almost exactly equal to the side of a square\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nIf you know the content and length of one of the sides of a\r\nrectangular figure it is easy to lay it off. Thus:\r\n\r\nGiven a claim 10 chains long, how wide must it be to cover 5 acres?\r\n\r\n5 times 10 equals 50 square chains.\r\n\r\n10 divided by 50 equals 5.\r\n\r\nAns. 5 chains wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFLOATING A COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nShould the prospector discover mineral that increases in amount as the\r\nmine is opened, and shows that it is likely to prove a profitable\r\ndeposit, he will have little difficulty in selling out to some wealthy\r\nsyndicate. But if his mine is likely to become a big producer he\r\nshould try rather to organize a company, of which he should be a\r\nshareholder--the controlling one if possible--as then the output of\r\nthe mine will probably make him a rich man. It is rare that a\r\nprospector selling outright obtains anything but a fraction of the\r\nvalue of a good mine. Nor is it reasonable to suppose he should. When\r\nhe sells, the profits of the buyers are all in the future, and may\r\nnever materialize. They take all risk, and consequently insist upon a\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\nThe more money a prospector can invest in the development of a good\r\nmine the better price he is likely to get when he sells. Business men\r\ndearly like to see great masses of ore in the shafts and cuts, and are\r\nalways more willing to pay a handsome price when they know something\r\ndistinctly promising about the purchase.\r\n\r\nLet the prospector, therefore, lay open his prospect as thoroughly as\r\nhe can with the means at his disposal, and if he has faith--as he\r\nshould have--in the mine he is selling, let him take a good big block\r\nof stock in part payment.\r\n\r\nHe must see to it, too, that sufficient working capital is provided,\r\nas there are very few mines that pay expenses from the start.\r\nSometimes, when the shareholders are very timid, and but little money\r\nhas been paid into the treasury in the first instance, they become\r\nrestive after a call or two and refuse to honor further demands. This\r\nhas been the ruin of many a promising venture.\r\n\r\nSupposing, however, that this mistake has been avoided, and that\r\nsufficient funds are in the treasury to meet all likely, legitimate\r\ndrains upon it, the question of officers remains a weighty one. The\r\nboard of directors should be level-headed, shrewd men, with\r\ncommon-sense, business ideas; the secretary should understand his\r\nwork; and the mining engineer placed in charge of the mine should be\r\none whose professional knowledge is equal to the demands of the\r\nposition. The secretary must have such a knowledge of the proper price\r\nof labor, and material, as to detect any extravagance on the part of\r\nthe manager.\r\n\r\nAt least one member of the board of directors should understand\r\nmining. Good salaries paid to the mining engineer or manager, and to\r\nthe secretary, will be money well spent, provided they are competent.\r\nCheap men have no business in such responsible positions, where the\r\nhandling and wise expenditure of large sums of money necessitate\r\nbrains and special training.\r\n\r\nAs to the mine manager, he should be a miner, surveyor, metallurgist,\r\nassayer, bookkeeper and half-dozen other things rolled into one, and\r\nthat one an honest man. Very low grade ore would probably pay in the\r\nhands of such a paragon of perfection--but he must be sought for long\r\nand diligently, and even then he may not be found.\r\n\r\nNew processes are to be shunned until they have proved their worth and\r\nceased to be new. No sooner is a mine floated than all sorts of knaves\r\nand fools appear on the scene, with new and wonderful appliances for\r\nsaving 99.9 per cent. of all the value in the ore. Be rude to them.\r\nDrive them away with sticks and stones if necessary, but as you value\r\nyour salvation do not hearken to them. Let some one else do the\r\nexperimenting; when you know a process is good, the time will have\r\ncome to spend money on it. There are at the present moment thousands\r\nof tons of costly machinery rusting in lonely Rocky Mountain canyons\r\nthat were in their day \"novelties,\" warranted to save all the values\r\nin the ore, while the unfortunate shareholders, whose misspent money\r\nfreighted these things to their final resting place, are now,\r\nperchance, \"touching\" the belated Chicago or New York pedestrians for\r\na nickel.\r\n\r\nThe only real guide to the economic value of an ore is the treatment\r\nof a large bulk of it in the mill.\r\n\r\nPlenty of ore should be kept blocked out ahead of the workings. The\r\nmore ore in sight the better for the future of the mine.\r\n\r\nLastly, remember that thieving sometimes takes place on rather a large\r\nscale, and be on the watch to detect it.\r\n\r\nBut there is a bright side to mining as well as a dark, and those\r\nfortunate men who paid 3, 5 or 8 cents for the stock of a mine that\r\nnow sells for $7 can see it quite plainly; and there are many such.\r\nMining is not a gamble as some would have the world believe, but a\r\nlegitimate occupation, demanding great nerve and skill, and sometimes\r\ngreat patience, but not infrequently rewarding the possessors of these\r\nadmirable attributes by wealth almost inexhaustible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL HINTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiners as a rule are a healthy, hardy lot of men, but nevertheless\r\nthey are occasionally taken ill, and there is very seldom a doctor\r\nnear at hand. Moreover, by the very nature of their work they are\r\nparticularly liable to accidents.\r\n\r\nThe so-called miner's consumption is caused by want of fresh air. The\r\nminer passes most of his life in places where there is a great\r\ndeficiency of oxygen. Deep down in the mine the air is usually very\r\nbad, being full of smoke and damp, and the hut in which he sleeps is\r\ntoo often overcrowded, while the places in which he seeks his\r\namusement, should he live in a mining camp, are usually little better.\r\nThe remedy for this state of affairs is to get all the fresh air\r\npossible, then consumption is not to be feared.\r\n\r\nShould poison have been swallowed, an emetic ought to be given as\r\nquickly as possible. Mustard, or salt and warm water, are tolerably\r\nefficacious, but a dose of 60 grains of ipecac is more effectual.\r\nWhile the emetic is acting, the patient should drink freely of warm\r\nwater or warm milk.\r\n\r\nIn case of apparent drowning the body should be stripped down to the\r\nwaist, rapidly dried, placed on a flat surface with the head and\r\nshoulders raised a little, and hot bricks applied to the feet.\r\nBreathing should be imitated by raising the arms above the head and\r\nturning the body on its side; turn the body back on the face and press\r\nthe arms down to the side. Do this about sixteen times a minute, and\r\nkeep it up half an hour if necessary.\r\n\r\nIn case of a wound which bleeds freely, a distinction must be made\r\nbetween blood issuing from a vein and blood issuing from an artery. In\r\nthe first instance, it will be nearly black, or at least very dark; in\r\nthe second, it will be bright red and spurt forth. When from a vein,\r\nbleeding must be controlled by pressure below the wound, that is,\r\nfarther away from the heart, while in the case of an artery, which is\r\nalways more dangerous, immediate pressure must be made above the wound\r\non the line of the artery between the wound and the heart. A pebble\r\nrolled up in a handkerchief and tied around the limb, with the stone\r\ndirectly above the artery, and tightened by twisting a stick in it, is\r\na good rough-and-ready means to stop bleeding. Sometimes a pad should\r\nbe placed between the handkerchief and the artery.\r\n\r\nAnything that excludes the air, such as wheat flour, or olive oil, or\r\nboiled linseed, or grated raw potato, is good to spread over a burn.\r\nIf any considerable surface is burned the patient is in great danger,\r\nbut small burns are rarely fatal, although they may be very painful.\r\nThe best application of all is linseed oil and lime water.\r\n\r\nScurvy is a disease that is very much to be dreaded whenever fresh\r\nmeat and vegetables are scarce. It is now thought to be a condition of\r\nacid-poisoning, and the remedy is alkaline salts, such as carbonate of\r\nsoda or carbonate of potash. Lime juice is also an anti-scorbutic. In\r\ncold weather a diet of almost exclusively fresh fat meat will keep off\r\nscurvy.\r\n\r\nPneumonia is usually most fatal in crowded camps, where the men do not\r\nget a sufficient amount of pure, fresh air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nDYNAMITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDynamite should be stored in a magazine which must be dry, cool, and\r\nwell ventilated. Bricks are best, but when built of wood, the frame\r\nshould be covered inside and out with boards allowing the air to have\r\nfree circulation between the walls, so that the inner wall may not be\r\nheated by the sun.\r\n\r\nDo not store your caps with your dynamite.\r\n\r\nIf powder was well made, it is as good a dozen years afterwards as it\r\nwas on the day it came from the mill.\r\n\r\nMost accidents occur in thawing dynamite. Dynamite freezes between 40\r\nand 45 degrees Far., that is, 10 degrees above the freezing point of\r\nwater, and although it does not explode, if heated slowly, until 320\r\ndegrees Far. is reached, yet the quick application of dry heat may\r\nexplode it at 120 degrees Far. This makes it so dangerous, for a stick\r\nof powder hot enough to explode under certain conditions may be held\r\nin the hand with little inconvenience. Powder should be thawed by\r\nplacing it in a water-tight vessel and the vessel set in hot water. It\r\nshould never be placed on or under a stove, or in an oven, or on a\r\nboiler wall to thaw out, as is so often done by the unthinking. Frozen\r\ndynamite is especially liable to explode from heat quickly applied.\r\nNevertheless, reckless men will continue to blow themselves to pieces\r\nby foolhardy carelessness.\r\n\r\nFrozen powder is unfit for use. It will burn or smoulder, and some of\r\nit may be left in the drill hole to explode when it is not wanted to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nATOMIC WEIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe atomic weight of a mineral is the proportion in which its elements\r\nare united, i.e., they represent the weights of the different atoms\r\nin the minerals. Hydrogen, being lightest, is made the unit.\r\n\r\nSupposing it becomes desirable to find the proportional weights of the\r\nelements of any substance with a known chemical formula. Multiply the\r\natomic weight of each element by the number of atoms of such element,\r\nand add these products together; this will give the weight of all. The\r\nproportion of each is arrived at by a simple calculation.\r\n\r\nFor instance: How much metallic silver is there in 100 pounds of\r\nArgentite, or silver glance, whose composition is Ag{2}S?\r\n\r\nThen\r\n\r\n    Ag equals 108 times 2,--216.\r\n    S equals 32 times 1,--32.\r\n\r\nSo that in every 248 pounds of the glance there are 216 pounds of\r\nmetallic silver, and by proportion we find its percentage is 87.1.\r\n\r\nThe following tables give the symbols, atomic weights and specific\r\ngravities of certain abundant elements. Rare elements are omitted:\r\n\r\n                           Symbol.  At. Wt.  Sp.

In some States it means the quantity of water\r\nthat will flow through an orifice one inch square on the bottom or\r\nside of a box under a pressure of four inches. Under these conditions\r\na miner's inch will discharge 2259 cubic feet, or 17,648 gallons every\r\ntwenty-four hours, which is at the rate of 12 gallons a minute. Fifty\r\nof these miner's inches are equal to a cubic foot of water discharged\r\nevery second. One cubic foot of water a second would be sufficient to\r\nsupply the wants of seven thousand city dwellers.\r\n\r\nIn calculating the amount of water required by a stamp mill it is\r\nusual to allow 72 gallons for every stamp, 120 gallons for every pan,\r\n75 gallons for every settler, 120 gallons for every Fruevanner, 30\r\ngallons for a concentrator, 350 gallons for a jig, and 7-1/2 gallons\r\nfor every horse-power of a boiler each hour. If the water after\r\npassing through the mill is impounded and used over again, the loss\r\nwill be about 25 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUMBER IN A LOG.\r\n\r\nTo Find: Multiply the diameter in inches at the small end by one-half\r\nthe number of inches, and again multiply this product by the length of\r\nthe log in feet; this product divided by 12 will give the number of\r\nfeet of one-inch boards the log will make.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSE-POWER OF BOILERS.\r\n\r\nFor horizontal, tubular and flue boilers, divide the number of feet of\r\nheating surface by 15; this will give the horse-power. A cord of pine\r\nwood weighing 2,000 pounds is about equal to 1,000 pounds of soft coal\r\nfor steam purposes. Each foot of grate should burn 20 pounds of soft\r\ncoal, or 40 of wood, per hour, with a natural draught.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSE-POWER OF AN ENGINE.\r\n\r\nMultiply the area of the cylinder in square inches by the average\r\neffective pressure in pounds to the square inch, deducting three\r\npounds per square inch for friction. Multiply this remainder by the\r\nspeed of the piston in feet per minute, and divide by 33,000. The\r\nquotient will be the true horse-power.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSE-POWER OF PELTON WHEEL.\r\n\r\nThe Pelton wheel is in high favor with California miners. When the\r\nhead of water is known in feet, multiply by 0.0024147 and the product\r\nis the horse-power that one miner's inch of water will give.\r\n\r\n\r\nASSAYING.\r\n\r\nThe muffle furnaces of the Morgan Crucible Company of Battersea are\r\nfavorably known. The most useful size is that taking a \"D\" Muffle,\r\n8-1/2 inches by 5 inches by 3-1/4 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHEAP \"TESTING\" OUTFIT.\r\n\r\nSometimes the pioneer is forced to attempt a good many investigations\r\nwith very simple apparatus. Should he possess the following, he can\r\nachieve much: A spirit lamp, candle, blow-pipe, magnet, a bottle of\r\nhydrochloric acid, quart glass jar, three test tubes with corks, two\r\nfeet of glass tubing (hard glass), copper wire, two square inches of\r\ntin plate, forceps and test paper. Such an outfit could certainly be\r\nbought for $1.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIGHT OF EARTH, SAND, GRAVEL, ETC.\r\n\r\n    A ton of shingle averages 23 cubic feet.\r\n    A ton of pit sand averages 22 cubic feet.\r\n    A ton of earth averages 21 cubic feet.\r\n    A ton of river sand averages 19 cubic feet.\r\n    A ton of coarse gravel averages 19 cubic feet.\r\n    A ton of clay averages 18 cubic feet.\r\n    A ton of marl averages 18 cubic feet.\r\n    A ton of chalk averages 14 cubic feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIGHTS OF ORES AND ROCKS.\r\n\r\nQuartz, 162 pounds a cubic foot; silver glance, 455 pounds; ruby\r\nsilver, 362; brittle silver, 386; horn silver, 345; antimony glance,\r\n287; cinnabar, 549; copper pyrites, 262; gray copper, 280; galena,\r\n461; zinc blende, 249; iron pyrites, 312; limestone, 174; clay, 162.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA PUMP.\r\n\r\nA very useful pump, in regions where transportation is a problem, is\r\nthe California pump. It is a rough chain-pump. A box 10 inches by 3\r\ninches, inside measurement, and 10 feet to 30 feet in length,\r\naccording to requirements, forms a tube reaching from the water to be\r\nremoved to the level at which it is to be discharged. In this an\r\nendless band of stout canvas or leather works, passing under a roller\r\nat the lower end, which is immersed in the water. At the higher end\r\nthe belt passes around a drum worked by water, horse, or manual power.\r\nOn the belt are wooden or metal projections that fit the box, forcing\r\nthe water upward as the drum revolves.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDRAULIC DATA.\r\n\r\nThe prospector, and more especially the miner, will do well to commit\r\nthe following figures to memory:\r\n\r\n    An Imperial gallon of water weighs 10 pounds.\r\n    Gallons multiplied by .1606 equals cubic feet.\r\n    Cubic feet multiplied by 6.288 equals gallons.\r\n    Gallons multiplied by 277.46 equals cubic inches.\r\n    Cubic inches multiplied by 0.003604 equals gallons.\r\n    Cubic feet multiplied by 62.8 equals pounds.\r\n    Pounds multiplied by .0166 equals cubic feet.\r\n    Gallons multiplied by 0.004464 equals tons.\r\n    Tons multiplied by 224 equals gallons.\r\n    Tons multiplied by 35.97 equals cubic feet.\r\n\r\nA head of 10 feet gives a pressure of about 4-1/3 pounds to the square\r\ninch. Let H represent the head of water in feet, and P the pressure to\r\nthe square inch. Then:\r\n\r\n    H equals P times 2.311.\r\n    P equals H times .4326.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FIRE LUTE.\r\n\r\nTo make a fire-proof joint between the lid and body of a retort, or\r\ncrucible, use the following as a lute:\r\n\r\n    Quartz sand.             8 parts.\r\n    Clay (pure as possible)  2 parts.\r\n    Horse dung               1 part.\r\n\r\nMix and temper like mortar.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF A VEIN.\r\n\r\nTo find the number of cubic feet per fathom of matter in a vein,\r\nmultiply its thickness in inches by 3. Great care is requisite in\r\nestimating the ore in a vein or the amount of mineral in sight. Very\r\nclever men often make grave mistakes in such calculations.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MAKE-SHIFT FLUX.\r\n\r\nRough smelting may be done with powdered white glass, though either\r\nborax or carbonate of soda is better. As soon as the gold is melted\r\nand the flux fluid and still, remove the bulk of the flux with an iron\r\nspoon, and pour the metal into a clay mould. Crush the flux for gold.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVING BLAST SAMPLES.\r\n\r\nPlace a quantity of spruce boughs over a hole before firing the shot,\r\nand very few stones will fly.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SIMPLE RETORT.\r\n\r\nSqueeze the quicksilver amalgam containing gold through a chamois skin\r\nor piece of cotton until it is as dry as you can get it. Then take a\r\nlarge potato, cut off one end and hollow out a piece of it large\r\nenough to receive the amalgam. Heat a shovel or a piece of sheet iron\r\nred hot, hold the potato up and press the shovel to it, covering the\r\namalgam. As soon as the potato sticks fast to the shovel, turn it over\r\nso that the potato is on the top and place it over the fire and keep\r\nit red hot until the retorting is finished. As soon as it cools,\r\nloosen the potato with a knife, and the gold will be underneath and\r\nthe quicksilver in the potato. The quicksilver may be recovered by\r\nbruising the potato to pulp in a cup with water.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEANING AMALGAMATED PLATES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA very simple plan for getting the gold off an amalgamated copper\r\nplate is as follows: Take out the surface dirt for the depth of nine\r\ninches over an area a little larger than the plate to be scaled; place\r\nsix bricks around the excavation as supports for the plate. Make a\r\nbrick fire, and let it burn down to red hot embers. Lay the plate on\r\nthree iron bars resting on the bricks, and cover the face with strips\r\nof old blanket soaked in a strong solution of borax. Keep the blankets\r\nwet with the solution, and when the amalgam is white, remove the plate\r\nand scrape.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALCULATING WEIGHT OF ORE.\r\n\r\nMeasure the cubic contents of the mass; multiply this by the weight of\r\none cubic foot of the mineral.\r\n\r\nFor small masses, where no scales are at hand, fill a bucket with\r\nwater, and stand it in an empty barrel. Fill the bucket brimful;\r\nintroduce the rock, or ore, and measure the water it displaces. Find\r\nthe number of cubic inches in the overflow by reference to the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n    1 gallon equals 231 cubic inches.\r\n    1 quart equals 57.75 cubic inches.\r\n    1 pint equals 28.87 cubic inches.\r\n    1 gill equals 7.21 cubic inches.\r\n\r\nMultiply the total so found by the specific gravity of the ore, and\r\nthe result will be the answer sought.\r\n\r\nSupposing the bottom of the bin to be wedge-shaped, measure half the\r\nheight from the bottom to the top and multiply the number of feet by\r\nthe width and length, both in feet. This will give number of cubic\r\nfeet in the bin. Multiply the number of cubic feet by the weight of\r\none cubic foot of the ore, and the result will show the number of\r\npounds of ore the bin will hold. Divide by 2,000 to reduce to tons.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINING REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe mining regulations of every country differ, and the prospector\r\nmust learn by heart the provisions of the one he works under. A claim\r\nnotice written with a hard pencil or surveyor's marking lead on a soft\r\npine board will last for years.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES.\r\n\r\n    Troy Weight.\r\n        24 grains                   1 pennyweight.\r\n        20 pwts.                          1 ounce.\r\n        12 ounces                         1 pound.\r\n\r\n    Long Measure.\r\n        12 inches                          1 foot.\r\n         3 feet                            1 yard.\r\n         2 yards                         1 fathom.\r\n        16-1/2 feet                         1 rod.\r\n         4 rods                           1 chain.\r\n        10 chains                       1 furlong.\r\n         8 furlongs                        1 mile.\r\n\r\n    Square Measure.\r\n         9 sq. feet                    1 sq. yard.\r\n        30-1/4 sq. yds.                1 sq. rod.\r\n        40 sq. rods                    1 sq. rood.\r\n         4 sq. roods                   1 sq. acre.\r\n       640 sq. acres                   1 sq. mile.\r\n       An acre is 209 feet square.\r\n\r\n    Land Measure.\r\n         7.92 inches                       1 link.\r\n        25 links                            1 rod.\r\n         4 rods                           1 chain.\r\n        80 chains                          1 mile.\r\n\r\n    Avoirdupois Weight.\r\n        16 drams                          1 ounce.\r\n        16 ounces                         1 pound.\r\n        25 pounds                       1 quarter.\r\n         4 quarters                         1 cwt.\r\n        20 cwt.
