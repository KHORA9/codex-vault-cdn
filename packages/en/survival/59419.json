The Laurentian\r\nrocks are now known to extend far beyond the limits of this area to\r\nthe west and north, constituting, as they do, by far the greater part\r\nof the Protaxis, and underlying (with subordinate patches of Huronian)\r\nan area of somewhat over two million square miles.[1] The area above\r\nreferred to is, however, the one which was first studied and described;\r\nit is the “Typical Laurentian area,” and to it the observations in the\r\npresent paper will be as far as possible confined.\r\n\r\nA general exploration of the area in question, and a more detailed\r\nstudy of a small part of it--the Grenville District--situated in the\r\ncounties of Argenteuil and Terrebonne in the Province of Quebec, was\r\ncarried out by Logan and his assistants in the early years of the\r\nCanadian Geological Survey. An excellent résumé of the results of these\r\nstudies is given in the “Geology of Canada,” published in 1863, which\r\ncontains not only a good description of the general petrographical\r\ncharacter and arrangement of the rocks which make up the area, but\r\nis accompanied by an atlas containing two maps illustrating this\r\ndescription, one showing the general distribution of the Laurentian in\r\nthe eastern part of the Dominion, and the other its stratigraphical\r\nrelations in the smaller area above referred to.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these studies, Logan announced his belief that the\r\nLaurentian System consisted of two great unconformable series of\r\nsedimentary rocks, to which he gave the names Upper and Lower\r\nLaurentian. The latter he considered to be divisible into a lower\r\nand an upper portion, which sub-divisions he regarded as probably\r\nconformable to one another. In the course of time these several series\r\ncame to be known as the Anorthosite or Norian Series, the Grenville\r\nSeries and the Fundamental or Ottawa Gneiss. Logan’s views may then be\r\nrepresented as follows:\r\n\r\n  Anorthosite or Norian Series,    Upper Laurentian.\r\n  Grenville Series,                Upper portion }   Lower\r\n  Fundamental or Ottawa Gneiss,    Lower portion } Laurentian.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, in the southeastern corner of the Province of Ontario,\r\nin the district lying to the north of the eastern end of Lake Ontario,\r\nanother series of rocks was discovered--the so-called Hastings Series.\r\nLogan supposed this to come in above the Grenville Series, while\r\nVennor, who subsequently examined the district, believed it to be\r\nequivalent to the lower part of the Grenville Series already mentioned.\r\n\r\nWhen these investigations were carried out, the microscope had not\r\nas yet been seriously employed in petrographical work. The precise\r\ncomposition of many of the rocks making up the several series was not\r\nrecognized, the effects produced by great dynamic action were not duly\r\nconsidered, and the foliation possessed in a high degree by some and\r\nto a certain extent by almost all these rocks was considered, in all\r\ncases, to be a more or less obliterated survival of original bedding.\r\nThe detailed mapping in the field, accompanied by microscopical work in\r\nthe laboratory, by which alone conclusive results can be obtained in\r\nworking out the structure of complicated areas of crystalline schists,\r\nwas not carried out, in fact in many districts the construction of\r\ndetailed maps was at that time practically impossible. It is not\r\nsurprising therefore that, although excellent in the main, some of the\r\nresults arrived at have since proved to be erroneous.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed, in the present paper, to place before the readers\r\nof this JOURNAL in as brief a manner as possible, a general account\r\nof the several series of rocks occurring in this area, and to point\r\nout what, in the opinion of the present writer, seems to have been\r\nsatisfactorily established concerning the stratigraphical position and\r\nmutual relations of these ancient rocks and what still remains to be\r\ndetermined by further study, and in conclusion to give a short sketch\r\nof the evolution of this portion of the continent.\r\n\r\n_The Fundamental Gneiss._--Exposed over very wide stretches of country\r\nin Canada, and making up in all probability by far the larger part of\r\nthe Archean Protaxis, is the “Fundamental Gneiss,” sometimes called,\r\nfrom its great development about the upper waters of the Ottawa River,\r\nthe “Ottawa Gneiss.” It is composed essentially of orthoclase gneiss,\r\nusually reddish or greyish in color. Of this there are a number of\r\nvarieties, differing from one another in size of grain, relative\r\nproportion of constituent minerals and in the distinctness of the\r\nfoliation or banding. It is sometimes rich in quartz, while at other\r\ntimes this mineral is present in but very small amount. It is usually\r\npoor in mica and bisilicates. Dark bands of amphibolite are not\r\nuncommon, while basic hornblende or pyroxene gneisses occur in some\r\nplaces. Other schistose rocks are rarely found. Over great areas it is\r\noften nearly uniform in character and possesses a foliation which can\r\nonly be recognized when exposures of considerable size are examined.\r\nOn this account it is often referred to as a granitoid gneiss, a\r\ndesignation, however, which by no means accurately describes it as a\r\nwhole. At a locality cited by Sir William Logan, as one where it is\r\ntypically developed, namely, Trembling Mountain in the above mentioned\r\nGrenville Area, it consists of a fine grained reddish orthoclase\r\ngneiss, with distinct but not very decided foliation, containing here\r\nand there bands of orthoclase gneiss of somewhat different character,\r\nas well as bands or layers of a dark amphibolite.\r\n\r\nHow much of this Fundamental Gneiss really consists of eruptive\r\nmaterial is not known. The indistinct foliation, in many cases at\r\nany rate, is not a survival of original bedding, but is clearly due\r\nto movements in a plastic mass. It is often possible to recognize\r\nthe existence of an indistinctly foliated gneiss intruded into\r\nmore distinctly foliated gneiss. The gneiss, in some cases, shows\r\nexcellently well-marked cataclastic structure, while in other cases\r\nthis is not distinct. The evidence accumulated goes to show that the\r\nFundamental Gneiss consists of a complicated series of rocks of unknown\r\norigin, but comprising a considerable amount of material of intrusive\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n_The Grenville Series._--In certain parts of the Laurentian area, and\r\nnotably in the Grenville district before mentioned, the Laurentian has\r\na decidedly different petrographical development. Orthoclase gneiss is\r\nstill the predominating rock, but it presents a much greater variety in\r\nmineralogical composition, and is much more frequently well foliated,\r\noften occurring in well defined bands or layers like the strata of\r\nlater formations.\r\n\r\nAmphibolites are abundant, also hornblende schists, heavy beds of\r\nquartzite and numerous thick bands of crystalline limestone or marble,\r\nall these rocks being interbanded or interstratified with one another.\r\nIn the vicinity of the limestones the variety in petrographical\r\ncharacter is especially noticeable; garnets often occur abundantly in\r\nthe gneiss, the quartzite and the hornblende schist, as well as in\r\nthe limestone itself, beds of pure garnet rock being found in places.\r\nPyroxene, wollastonite and other minerals are also abundant, while the\r\npresence of graphite disseminated through the limestones and their\r\nassociated rocks, often in such abundance as to give rise to deposits\r\nof economic value, is of especial significance. This mineral which\r\nis not found in the Fundamental Gneiss, occurs usually in little\r\ndisseminated scales but occasionally in veins. The limestones are\r\nthoroughly crystalline, generally somewhat coarse in grain and often\r\nnearly pure. They usually, however, contain grains of serpentine,\r\npyroxene, mica, graphite or other minerals, of which over fifty species\r\nhave been noted. They are often interstratified in thin bands with\r\nthe gneiss, in places are very impure, and may be traced for great\r\ndistances along the strike, being apparently as continuous as any other\r\nelement of the series. This development of the Laurentian is known as\r\nthe Grenville Series, and has been considered by all observers to be\r\nabove and to rest upon the Fundamental Gneiss. In it are found all\r\nthe mineral deposits of economic value--apatite, iron ore, asbestos,\r\netc., which occur in the Laurentian. The rocks of this series, though\r\ngenerally highly inclined, over some large areas lie nearly horizontal\r\nor are inclined at very low angles, but even in such cases they show\r\nevidence of having been subjected to great pressure, resulting in some\r\ncases in the horizontal disruption of certain of the beds.\r\n\r\nThe areas occupied by the Grenville series although of very\r\nconsiderable extent, being known to aggregate many thousand square\r\nmiles, are probably small as compared with those underlain by the\r\nFundamental Gneiss. The relative distribution of the two series has not\r\nbeen ascertained except in a general way in the more easily-accessible\r\nparts of the great Archean Protaxis. The Grenville series is known to\r\noccupy a large part of its southern margin between the city of Quebec\r\nand the Georgian Bay, while the discovery of crystalline limestone\r\nin the gneiss elsewhere at several widely separated points, as for\r\ninstance on the Hamilton River in Labrador, in the southern part of\r\nBaffin Land and on the Melville Peninsula, makes it probable that other\r\nconsiderable areas will, with the progress of geological exploration,\r\nbe found in the far north. Over the greater part of the Protaxis,\r\nhowever, the more monotonous development of the Fundamental Gneiss\r\nseems to prevail.\r\n\r\nThe question of the origin and mutual relations of the Fundamental\r\nGneiss and the Grenville series is one about which, though much has\r\nbeen written but little is known. Three views may be taken on the\r\nmatter--\r\n\r\n(1) The Fundamental Gneiss may be supposed to contain what remains of\r\na primitive crust, penetrated by great masses of igneous rock erupted\r\nthrough it--the whole having been subjected to repeated dynamic\r\naction.[2] The Grenville Series may be an upward continuation or\r\ndevelopment of the Fundamental Gneiss under altered conditions, marking\r\nin the history of the world the transition from those conditions\r\nunder which a primitive crust formed to those in which sedimentation\r\nunder the present normal conditions took place. It would seem that if\r\nthe earth originally had a crust on which the first sediments were\r\ndeposited when the temperature became sufficiently low to permit water\r\nto condense, that the said water, at a very high temperature and under\r\nwhat are to us now inconceivable conditions but little removed from\r\nfusion, might give rise to sediments not altogether similar to those\r\nformed by the ordinary processes of erosion at the present time. Also\r\nthat, under the unique conditions which must have prevailed at that\r\nearly time, in the formation of a crust solidification, precipitation\r\nand sedimentation might go on to a certain extent concomitantly,\r\nand thus no well-defined break could be detected, or would in fact\r\nexist, between a primitive crust formed by solidification from a fused\r\nmagma and the earliest aqueous sediments or deposits. The Fundamental\r\nGneiss and the Grenville Series might thus, as Logan supposed, form\r\none practically continuous series and represent parts of the original\r\ncrust, with the first crystalline or clastic sediments deposited on it,\r\nthe whole penetrated by eruptive rocks and folded up and altered by\r\nrepeated dynamic action at subsequent periods.\r\n\r\nThe general petrographical similarity of the two series, taken in\r\nconnection with the more varied nature of the Grenville Series, its\r\nfrequent stratified character, and the presence in it of limestones and\r\ngraphite indicating an approach to modern conditions and the advent of\r\nlife, together with the difficulty of clearly separating the two series\r\nfrom one another and defining their respective limits, lends support to\r\nthis view.\r\n\r\n(2) A second view is that the Grenville Series is distinct from the\r\nFundamental Gneiss reposing on it unconformably and of much more recent\r\nage; that it consists of a highly altered series of clastic origin--the\r\nFundamental Gneiss having possibly some such origin as that mentioned\r\nunder the last heading, or representing a much older series of still\r\nmore highly altered sediments. This is supported by the fact that\r\nsome observers have thought they could in places trace out a line of\r\ncontact between the two. But in these cases it always becomes a matter\r\nof serious doubt whether what has been considered to represent the\r\nFundamental Gneiss is not really a mass of intrusive rock, in which,\r\nby pressure or motion, a somewhat gneissic structure has been induced.\r\nIf the Fundamental Gneiss, moreover, was ever an ordinary sediment,\r\nit must have undergone a metamorphosis so profound that no trace of\r\nclastic origin remains, unless the generally indistinct foliation or\r\nbanding of some portions of it be considered as such. It must also be\r\nnoted in this connection that, although the rocks of the Grenville\r\nseries are more frequently possessed of a decided foliation and are\r\noften banded, bands of different composition alternating with one\r\nanother as in ordinary sedimentary deposits, and although in this\r\nseries crystalline limestones and quartzites occur, we have as yet no\r\nabsolutely conclusive proof that even they are of sedimentary origin.\r\nThe series is thoroughly crystalline, most of its members at least show\r\nthe effect of great dynamic action, and so far as the present writer is\r\naware, no undoubted conglomerate or finer grained rock showing distinct\r\nclastic structure has ever been found. In view of this fact,--although\r\nthe series is, in all probability, made up in part at least and perhaps\r\nwholly of sedimentary material,--the proposal to separate it from the\r\nrest of the Laurentian and class it as Algonkian or Huronian seems at\r\nleast premature.\r\n\r\n(3) A third view which has been advanced is that the Fundamental Gneiss\r\nis nothing more than a great mass of eruptive granite or granitic\r\nrock which has eaten upward, and in places penetrated the Grenville\r\nseries, or perhaps absorbed it, while the Grenville series itself\r\nrepresents a series of highly altered sediments of Laurentian, Huronian\r\nor subsequent age. The enormous extent and world-wide distribution\r\nof the Fundamental Gneiss forming as it does wherever the base of\r\nthe geological column is exposed to view, the foundation or floor on\r\nwhich all subsequent rocks are seen to rest, is opposed to this view\r\nof its origin, as is also its persistent gneissic or banded character,\r\nalthough, as above mentioned, much eruptive material is undoubtedly to\r\nbe found in it.\r\n\r\nWhich of these views is correct can be ascertained only as very careful\r\nand detailed mapping, accompanied by accurate petrographical study,\r\nis proceeded with. In the present state of our knowledge additional\r\nargument and discussion will not help us toward the goal, while hasty\r\nwork and generalization serves but to retard the progress of our\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n_The Anorthosite Series._--Associated with both the series of rocks\r\njust described there are, as has been mentioned, great eruptive masses\r\nof granite, some of which have been folded in with the gneisses, while\r\nothers evidently erupted at a much later date, show no trace of dynamic\r\naction.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, basic eruptive rocks belonging to the gabbro\r\nfamily occur in certain districts, sometimes in the form of\r\ncomparatively insignificant masses, but elsewhere underlying great\r\ntracts of country. One on the upper waters of the Saguenay has an area\r\nof no less than 5,800 square miles. These usually consist of a variety\r\nof gabbro in which the magnesia-iron constituents are present in very\r\nsmall amount, being in many cases entirely wanting, so that the rock\r\nconsists practically of pure plagioclase feldspar. These rocks were\r\ncalled _anorthosites_ by Hunt, in the early reports of the Canadian\r\nGeological Survey, on account of the great preponderance in them of\r\n“Anorthose,” a general name given many years ago by Delesse to the\r\ntriclinic feldspars, as distinguished from “Orthose,” or orthoclase\r\nfeldspar, and thus equivalent to the term plagioclase now in general\r\nuse, but having no connection with anorthite, a variety of plagioclase\r\nwhich is seldom present. After a careful study of these rocks, both\r\nin the field and the laboratory, it is believed that this name should\r\nbe retained for this well-marked member of the gabbro family, which,\r\nthough not a common rock elsewhere, has an enormous distribution in the\r\nLaurentian of Canada.\r\n\r\nIf an olivine gabbro be regarded as the central member, so to speak,\r\nof the gabbro family, the replacement of the monoclinic by rhombic\r\npyroxene will give rise to an olivine norite. A gradual diminution in\r\nthe amount of plagioclase will give rise to a peridotite or gabbro\r\npyroxenite, a diminution in the amount of pyroxene to a troktolite or\r\nplagioclase-olivine rock, while a diminution in the amount of olivine\r\nand pyroxene will give rise to an anorthosite, which variety forms\r\nthe greater part of the intrusive masses in question. The gradual\r\npassage of one variety into another can be distinctly traced in many\r\nlocalities in the anorthosite masses. These anorthosites are in some\r\nplaces massive, but very frequently show a distinct foliation, often\r\nvery perfect. In some places they occur interbanded with the gneiss and\r\ncrystalline limestone, while elsewhere they cut directly across the\r\nstrike of these rocks. The interbanded anorthosite, together with the\r\ngneiss and limestone associated with it, was supposed by Logan to form\r\na distinct sedimentary series, to which the name “Upper Laurentian,”\r\nor “Norian,” was given, because the discovery that elsewhere the\r\nanorthosite runs across the strike of the gneiss was supposed to\r\nindicate that this series covered up and unconformably overlay\r\nthe Grenville series, the igneous and intrusive character of the\r\nanorthosite not being recognized on account of its frequently foliated\r\nstructure. It is now known that these anorthosites do not constitute an\r\nindependent formation, but are igneous rocks which occur, cutting both\r\nthe Grenville series and the Fundamental gneiss. They have, however,\r\nin many cases been intruded before the cessation of the great dynamic\r\nmovements to which the Laurentian was subjected in pre-Cambrian times,\r\nand thus frequently taking a line of least resistance and having been\r\nintruded between the bands or strata of the Grenville series, have had\r\na foliation induced in them parallel to that of the gneiss, while in\r\nother cases where they are more or less massive, they cut across the\r\nstrike of the latter.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the anorthosites which exhibit a perfect foliation may be\r\ntraced step by step into the massive variety, the gradual development\r\nof a foliated structure in the rock being accompanied by a progressive\r\ngranulation of the constituents, most beautifully seen under the\r\nmicroscope. The change, however, differs from any hitherto described\r\nin that it is purely mechanical. There are no lines of shearing with\r\naccompanying chemical changes, but a breaking up of the constituents\r\nthroughout the whole mass, though in some places this has progressed\r\nmuch further than in others, unaccompanied by any alteration of augite\r\nor hypersthene to hornblende, or of plagioclase to saussurite, these\r\nminerals, though prone to such alteration under pressure remaining\r\nquite unaltered, suffering merely a granulation with the arrangement\r\nof the granulated material in parallel strings. This process can be\r\nobserved in all its stages, and there is reason to believe that it\r\nhas been brought about by pressure acting on the rocks when they were\r\ndeeply buried and very hot.[3] The anorthosite areas, of which there\r\nare about a dozen of great extent with many of smaller size, are\r\ndistributed along the south and southeastern edge of the main Archean\r\nProtaxis from Labrador to Lake Champlain, occupying in this way a\r\nposition similar to that of volcanoes along the edge of our present\r\ncontinents. Curiously enough precisely similar occurrences of this\r\nanorthosite have been found in connection with similar gneissic rocks,\r\nsupposed to be of Archean age, in Russia, Norway and Egypt. These\r\nanorthosite rocks being intrusive, may be left out of consideration in\r\nendeavoring to work out the succession of the Archean in this great\r\narea.\r\n\r\nThe whole Laurentian system, including the anorthosites, is in many\r\nplaces cut by numerous dykes of large size, which can often be traced\r\nfor great distances. These are of several kinds, the principal series\r\nconsisting of a beautiful fresh diabase often holding quartz in\r\nconsiderable amount in micro-pegmatitic intergrowths with plagioclase.\r\nOther sets of dykes and eruptive masses consisting of augite and mica\r\nsyenites, quartz-porphyries and other rocks are also known to occur but\r\nhave not as yet been carefully studied.\r\n\r\n_The Hastings Series._--The stratigraphical relations of the Hastings\r\nseries have not as yet been satisfactorily determined. The rocks\r\nconstituting the series differ widely in petrographical character from\r\nthose of the Fundamental Gneiss and the Grenville series, both of\r\nwhich are supposed to occur in its immediate neighborhood. The series\r\nconsists largely of calc-schists, mica-schists, dolomites, slates and\r\nconglomerates, thus containing much material of undoubtedly clastic\r\norigin. It has moreover a very local development, being confined, so\r\nfar as at present known, to one small corner of the area, as has been\r\nmentioned. It was by Logan supposed to come in above the Grenville\r\nseries, while Vennor who subsequently examined the district, believed\r\nit to be equivalent to the lower part of this series. That we have in\r\nthe Hastings series a comparatively unaltered part of the Grenville\r\nseries, made up largely of rocks whose origin is easily recognized,\r\nwould be a most important fact if established, and would, of course,\r\nafford a key to the whole question of the origin of the latter. This\r\nis a conclusion, however, which cannot be accepted until supported by\r\nvery clear and decisive evidence, especially as the stratigraphy of the\r\nHastings district is very complicated, the several series represented\r\nin it being much folded and penetrated by great masses of eruptive\r\nrocks. The whole district has also been subject to great dynamic\r\naction, some of the pebbles in the conglomerates of the Hastings series\r\nbeing distorted in a most remarkable manner. This series may prove\r\nto be merely an outlying area of Huronian rocks folded in with the\r\nLaurentian, and until the district has been studied in detail its\r\nstratigraphical position must remain a matter of conjecture.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Hastings series out of consideration therefore, we have\r\nin this Original and Typical Laurentian area two developments of the\r\nLaurentian, generally considered as constituting two series, namely the\r\n\r\n  Grenville or Upper series,\r\n  Fundamental, Ottawa, or Lower Gneiss.\r\n\r\n_The Evolution of the Area._--In endeavoring to outline the main\r\nevents in the evolution of this area it will be necessary to extend\r\nthe limits of our observation somewhat and seek for evidence bearing\r\non the question in other parts of the Protaxis, where we meet with\r\ndevelopments of Huronian and various earlier Paleozoic strata not found\r\nin the typical area itself.\r\n\r\nFrom the highly contorted condition of the Laurentian rocks of this\r\narea as well as from the abundant evidences of dynamic action which\r\nthey present both in the field and under the microscope, it is evident\r\nthat they have been subjected to great orographic forces, which in\r\nvery early times threw them up into mountain ranges, probably of\r\ngreat height. Some of the associated eruptive rocks were intruded\r\nbefore these movements began, or while they were in progress and have\r\naccordingly been influenced by them, while others, having been intruded\r\nlater, have not been affected.\r\n\r\nHow high these mountains rose cannot of course be determined. Bell\r\nstates that some of the mountains on the Labrador coast now rise to a\r\nheight of from 5,000 to 6,000 feet, while Lieber has estimated that on\r\nthe coast of Northern Labrador they rise to a height of from 6,000 to\r\n10,000 feet. Along the southern part of the Protaxis, where the country\r\nis much lower, notwithstanding the enormous subaerial denudation and\r\nglaciation which the area has repeatedly undergone, there are many\r\npoints still rising from 2,500 to 3,500 feet above sea level, while\r\nLogan estimated that the average elevation is from 1,500 to 1,600 feet.\r\nIn the Adirondacks, which are but an outlying portion of this area,\r\nthere are elevations of over 5,400 feet. The high elevations attained\r\nby these rocks in portions of the Protaxis in the north may, of course,\r\nbe due to differential elevation, but immediately along the southern\r\nedge of the area there can have been but little differential change of\r\nlevel as compared with the flat-lying Potsdam strata which border it\r\nand lie but little above the present sea level. Further evidence of\r\nthe original height or continued uprising of the area is afforded by\r\nthe fact that all the material of which the North American continent\r\nwas built up (with the possible exception of some of the limestones)\r\nwas derived originally from the Archean Protaxis of the continent, a\r\nconsiderable proportion of this at least coming from the main Protaxis\r\nof which this typical Laurentian area forms a part. We must conclude\r\ntherefore that in early Cambrian or pre-Cambrian times, in portions of\r\nthe Protaxis at least, the Laurentian mountains rose several hundred\r\nand possibly in places several thousand feet above the sea level.\r\n\r\nThe intrusion of the granites and anorthosites as well as the folding\r\nof the whole system of rocks took place before Upper Cambrian times.\r\nThe whole series was moreover without doubt at that time in the\r\n“metamorphic” condition in which we now find it, for along the margin\r\nof the area the Potsdam sandstone rests in flat undisturbed beds on the\r\ndeeply eroded remnants of these old mountains, its basal beds often\r\nconsisting of a conglomerate with pebbles of the underlying gneissic\r\nrocks. These Cambrian strata cover up the gneisses, granites and\r\nanorthosites alike and are evidently of much more recent age, being\r\nseparated from the Laurentian by the long interval occupied in the\r\nupheaval and erosion of the Laurentian area.\r\n\r\nHow long before Upper Cambrian times this folding and erosion took\r\nplace cannot be determined from a study of this area, but further west\r\nalong the edge of the Protaxis in the Lake Superior district we find\r\nthat the Keweenawan, Nipigon and Animikie Series also repose in flat\r\nundisturbed beds on the eroded remnants of a series of crystalline\r\nrocks which have the petrographical character of the Fundamental\r\nGneiss. This makes it at least very probable that in this eastern area\r\nalso the erosion took place in pre-Cambrian times.\r\n\r\nIt is a very remarkable fact that the roche moutonné character\r\npossessed by these eroded Laurentian rocks and which is usually\r\nattributed to the glaciation which they underwent in Pleistocene\r\ntimes, was really impressed upon them in the first instance in these\r\npre-Cambrian times, for all along the edge of the nucleus from Lake\r\nSuperior to the Saguenay, the Paleozoic strata, often in little\r\npatches, can be seen to overlie and cover up a mammillated and roche\r\nmoutonné surface showing no traces of decay and similar to that exposed\r\nover the uncovered part of the area. The conclusion therefore seems\r\ninevitable that not only were these Laurentian rocks sharply folded\r\nand subjected to enormous erosion, but that they had given to them in\r\npre-Cambrian times their peculiar hummocky contours so suggestive of\r\nice action.[4] The pre-Paleozoic surface of the Fundamental Gneiss of\r\nScotland, as Sir Archibald Geikie has shown, also presents the same\r\nhummocky character.[5] On this surface the Upper Huronian, Cambrian,\r\nand later Paleozoic rocks were deposited.\r\n\r\nTo what extent the seas of Cambrian, Silurian and Devonian times passed\r\nover this area cannot be determined with certainty. A great series of\r\nrocks referred to by Dr. G. M. Dawson as probably of Lower Cambrian\r\nage and analogous in character to the Keweenawan and Animikie series\r\noccur overlying the Laurentian in many parts of the Protaxis, not only\r\nalong its margin, but as outliers at many places in the interior. It\r\noccurs extensively developed about the Arctic Ocean and about Hudson’s\r\nBay, and a large area of rocks referred to the same age also occur near\r\nthe height of land about Lake Mistassini. “Throughout the whole of\r\nthe vast northern part of the continent this characteristic Cambrian\r\nformation, composed largely of volcanic rocks, apparently occupies the\r\nsame unconformable position with regard to the underlying Laurentian\r\nand Huronian systems. Its present remnants serve to indicate the\r\nposition of some of the earliest geological basins, which from the\r\nattitude of the rocks appear to have undergone comparatively little\r\ndisturbance. Its extent entitles it to be recognized as one of the\r\nmost important geological features of North America.”[6] It would,\r\ntherefore, seem that in Cambrian times a not inconsiderable part of\r\nthe Archean Nucleus was under water. Outliers of Cambro-Silurian age\r\nare also found at several points lying well within the margin of\r\nthe Nucleus, as for instance in the Ottawa River about Pembroke at\r\na distance of fifty miles, and at Lake St. John at the head of the\r\nSaguenay River at a distance of one hundred and thirty miles from its\r\npresent limit. There is reason to believe that a similar outlier exists\r\nin the interior of the northern part of the Peninsula of Labrador, so\r\nthat the Lower Paleozoic sea must also have covered considerable areas\r\nin the eastern half of the Protaxis, where now nothing but Laurentian\r\nis to be seen. In that portion of the Protaxis lying to the west of\r\nHudson’s Bay strata of Cambro-Silurian and Devonian age extend up from\r\nthe basin of Hudson’s Bay on the east and from the great plains on the\r\nwest far over the Laurentian Plateau and probably, according to Dr.\r\nDawson, originally inosculated. Strata of Upper Silurian and Devonian\r\nage are not known to exist in the eastern half of the Protaxis, of\r\nwhich the typical Laurentian area forms part, with the exception of a\r\nsmall outlier of Niagara age on Lake Temiscamangue at the head waters\r\nof the Ottawa--neither do any other deposits of later age occur with\r\nthe exception of the Glacial Drift. What evidence there is, therefore,\r\nwould rather indicate that the area, during late Paleozoic, Mesozoic\r\nand earlier Tertiary times, was out of water. If so, it must have\r\nundergone during this great lapse of ages a process of deep seated\r\ndecay and denudation, culminating in the extensive glaciation to which\r\nit was subjected in Pleistocene times.\r\n\r\nDuring this latter period the whole area was exposed to ice action,\r\nwith the exception of the highest part of the Nucleus--the mountains\r\nof the Labrador coast--which, except toward the base, are still\r\n“softened, eroded and deeply decayed.”[7] This extensive denudation\r\nserved to remove all but mere remnants of any Paleozoic strata\r\noriginally deposited on the Archean of this area, while the deep decay\r\nof the Archean rocks themselves would account for the immense numbers\r\nof gneiss bowlders in the drift, which in all probability are but\r\nsmoothed cores of “bowlders of decomposition.” That an immense amount\r\nof material was removed from the surface of the area during the glacial\r\nage is shown by the immense quantities of Archean material which occurs\r\nscattered over the surface of the Nucleus itself, as well as in the\r\ndrift to the south. The glaciation, with the depression and uplift\r\nwhich succeeded it, was the last episode in the evolution of this\r\n“original” Laurentian area and one which impressed upon it its present\r\nsurface characters and type of landscape.\r\n\r\nIt is now an immense uneven plateau, comparatively slightly accentuated\r\nexcept along the Labrador coast. The surface is covered with glaciated\r\nhills and bosses of rock with rounded, mammilated, flowing contours\r\ninterspersed with drift covered flats and studded with thousands upon\r\nthousands of lakes great and small. A country which in the far north is\r\noften bleak and desolate, but to the south, where it is covered with\r\nluxuriant forest, is often of great beauty, especially when clothed\r\nwith the brilliant foliage of autumn. Even now, however, it is passing\r\ninto a further stage of its history, the smooth or polished glaciated\r\nsurfaces are becoming roughened by decay, the softer gneissic and\r\nlimestone strata are again commencing to crumble into soil, and a new\r\nepoch has been inaugurated in which the marks of the ice age are being\r\ngradually effaced.\r\n\r\n                    FRANK D.

On the geological map of the\r\nUnited States, compiled by C. H. Hitchcock, 1886, there are two of\r\nthe localities marked near the boundary of the Cretaceous and earlier\r\nTertiary formation, between 99° and 100° longitude, and on the 29th\r\ndegree of latitude. According to the statement of Professor Dumble,\r\none part of the rocks appears in dikes in the upper portion of the\r\nlower Cretaceous formation, while the other forms hills and buttes.\r\nUpon microscopical examination it is evident that the specimens\r\ncollected belong to two different groups of rocks. The microscope shows\r\nthat those occurring in dikes consist of typical melilite-bearing\r\nnepheline-basalt, while those making up hills and buttes are\r\nnepheline-basanites tending toward phonolites in composition.\r\n\r\nThe melilite-nepheline-basalts have a typical basaltic appearance. In a\r\ndense black groundmass, the only phenocrysts seen by the naked eye are\r\nnumerous olivines. Under the microscope there appear in addition to the\r\nolivine the following minerals: augite, nepheline, melilite, magnetite\r\nand perovskite. As to the proportion of nepheline and melilite, it can\r\nbe said, that in nearly all the specimens examined, the two minerals\r\nare found in about the same amount. For this reason these rocks can\r\nbe placed under the head of nepheline-basalt as well as under that\r\nof melilite-basalt, or they may be called melilite-nepheline-basalt.\r\nOnly one of the specimens is entirely free from melilite. Feldspar is\r\nwholly wanting. All of the specimens are in a very fresh condition, and\r\neven the melilite shows only slight indications of decomposition. The\r\nspecimen free from melilite corresponds in structure and composition\r\nwith the other specimens, except for the absence of melilite and\r\nperovskite, and so they may be described together.\r\n\r\nAll the rocks are porphyritic, since they bear large phenocrysts of\r\nolivine. Under the microscope the olivine is colorless and transparent,\r\nand only shows indications of serpentinization along the edges and\r\nfissures. It contains rounded inclusions of glass, abundant in some\r\nsections, besides octahedrons of magnetite, and others that are\r\ntransparent with a brownish violet color. Whether the latter are a\r\nmineral of the spinel-group or belong to perovskite, with which they\r\naccord in color, could not be decided.\r\n\r\nAugite occurs in only one generation; phenocrysts of augite are\r\nwanting. In the rather coarse-grained groundmass, it becomes the most\r\nabundant constituent. The mineral shows a grayish-brown color, common\r\nto basaltic augite, sometimes with a tint of violet. It generally forms\r\nwell-shaped crystals, rarely irregular grains, and bears inclusions of\r\nmagnetite and glass.\r\n\r\nMelilite occurs in the groundmass in large and well-shaped crystals,\r\nits dimensions never becoming as small as those of many of the augite\r\ncrystals. They may be designated as micro-porphyritical phenocrysts.\r\nCross sections parallel to (001) reach a diameter of 0.5 mm. The\r\nshape of the melilite is the common one, tabular parallel to (001).\r\nThe diameter of the tables generally exceeds their thickness from\r\nfour to six times. Sections parallel to the prism-zone, therefore,\r\nare lath-shaped and the vertical axis lies perpendicular to their\r\nlength; the axis of greatest elasticity coincides with the vertical\r\naxis. Between crossed nicols these sections show the particular blue\r\ninterference colors characteristic of melilite and zoisite. Sections\r\nperpendicular to the prism-zone are eight-sided by reason of the planes\r\n(110) and (100), but frequently the outlines are rounded. In some\r\nof the sections examined the melilite incloses minute opaque grains\r\narranged zonally, which present very sharply the prismatic outlines of\r\ntheir host. Besides the two prismatic faces above mentioned, there is\r\nalso a ditetragonal prism, the angle of which upon the adjoining faces\r\nof (110) and (100) was found to be nearly equal, 20°-22°. According\r\nto this measurement the prism must have approximately the position of\r\n(940); the angle of the latter upon (110) is 21° 2´, the angle upon\r\n(100) = 23° 58´. A particular phenomenon in the growth of the melilite\r\nis the fact that the base does not generally present an even plane, but\r\nshows a conical depression. The shape of the lath-shaped sections then\r\nresembles the profile of a biconcave lens. Sections parallel to the\r\nbase are isotropic between crossed nicols and show, when they are not\r\ntoo thin, an indistinct dark cross in convergent light. The cleavage\r\nparallel to (001), the cross-fibration of the lath-shaped sections\r\nand the occurrence of the spear-shaped and peg-shaped inclusions\r\narranged parallel to the _c_ axis (the so-called _Pflockstruktur_)\r\nare very distinct. Inclusions of pyroxene, magnetite and glass are\r\ncommon; as already mentioned, these inclusions are generally arranged\r\nin zones. In sections parallel to (001) they fill the central parts\r\nof their host, and often make up two or three concentric zones. These\r\nsections closely resemble leucite because of their rounded shape,\r\nthe arrangement of the inclusions and the lack of double refraction.\r\nMelilite becomes nearly colorless and transparent, but in comparing it\r\nwith the white, colorless nepheline, it shows a feeble yellow tint.\r\nDecomposition has taken place to only a small extent; it begins along\r\nthe cross-fibration, and greenish-yellow alteration-products result,\r\nthe fibres of which are perpendicular to the length of the lath-shaped\r\nsections.\r\n\r\nNepheline is always fresh, colorless and transparent; it rarely\r\nexhibits a regular shape, but generally forms an aggregate of irregular\r\ngrains, cementing the other components; it is evidently the latest\r\nformed mineral in the rock.\r\n\r\nThere is abundant magnetite besides perovskite, the common associate of\r\nmelilite, which occurs in small octahedrons and irregular grains. The\r\nperovskite becomes transparent with a brownish-violet color, and shows\r\nin some sections a feeble, abnormal double refraction. There appears\r\nto be no isotropic base in the normal rock, but if any is present, it\r\nmust be in a very small amount. There are coarser grained spots in\r\nthe rock, which are rich in a partly chloritized base, and in which\r\nnepheline occurs in well-shaped crystals.\r\n\r\nThe second group of rocks, as already mentioned, falls under the\r\nhead of nepheline-basanite poor in olivine. And since the specimens\r\nbear sanidine phenocrysts beside plagioclase, it forms a transition\r\nto phonolite. The rock-specimens have a more andesitic than basaltic\r\nappearance. Numerous phenocrysts of hornblende and augite are imbedded\r\nin the dense bluish-gray groundmass. The next most abundant mineral is\r\nnepheline in the form of phenocrysts, in part well-shaped crystals,\r\nin part rounded, the largest of which are 0.5 cm. in diameter. The\r\nnepheline differs from the feldspar in having a grayish color and\r\ngreasy lustre. Phenocrysts of feldspar and crystals of olivine are\r\nscarce. Beside these components, the rocks contain apatite, some\r\ntitanite and iron ores. Under the microscope olivine is seen to be\r\nscarce. It is fresh and shows the normal properties. It contains minute\r\noctahedrons of picotite and in some sections abundant inclusions of a\r\nliquid with moving bubbles.\r\n\r\nThe amphibole mineral is a typical basaltic hornblende. It becomes\r\ntransparent with a dark reddish-brown color and exhibits a strong\r\npleochroism according to the following scheme:\r\n\r\n=a=, brownish yellow, =b= and =c= dark reddish brown. Absorption,\r\n=c > b > a=.\r\n\r\nThe angle of extinction was examined in sections cut approximately\r\nparallel to the clinopinacoid (010) and was determined to be very\r\nsmall. This fact and the dark reddish-brown color are in all\r\nprobability due to a high amount of Fe₂O₃. The dependence of the angle\r\nof extinction upon the amount of Fe₂O₃ in minerals of the amphibole\r\ngroup has been recently established by Schneider and Belowsky. The\r\nbasaltic hornblende shows the well-known dark borders produced by\r\nreabsorption by the magma in an early stage of consolidation. In\r\nmany cases nothing of the original mineral is preserved; the whole\r\nhornblende is replaced by a fine grained aggregate of pyroxene and\r\nmagnetite, presenting clearly the outlines of the absorbed mineral.\r\n\r\nThe group of pyroxenic minerals is represented by two monoclinic\r\naugites. One of them exhibits a violet-gray color in thin section and\r\nbelongs to the basaltic augites; the other one becomes transparent\r\nwith a dark green color. Both form numerous phenocrysts, but the first\r\noccurs somewhat more frequently. They occur as single crystals and are\r\nalso grown together in a zonal manner, the green one always forming the\r\ncenter, the gray one the outer parts of the crystals. Hence the gray\r\naugite is the younger. The pyroxene in the groundmass shows the same\r\ncolor and properties. The pleochroism of the two minerals is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Gray augite.            Green augite.\r\n  =a= Brownish-yellow     Light yellowish-green\r\n  =b= }                   Dark gray-green\r\n  =c= } Violet-gray       Dark green.\r\n\r\nThe angle of extinction, _c_: =c=, is large and, as may be seen in the\r\nzonal crystals, it is somewhat larger in the gray pyroxene than in the\r\ngreen. The extinction in sections cut approximately parallel to (010)\r\nhas been observed to be about 47 degrees (gray augite) and 41 degrees\r\n(green augite). The two pyroxenes show in addition to the cleavage\r\nparallel to (110) another but less distinct one parallel to (010).\r\nInclusions of magnetite, apatite and glass are common.\r\n\r\nPhenocrysts of feldspar are scarce. In part they show the polysynthetic\r\ntwinning lamination of plagioclase; in part the latter is wanting\r\nand one of the latter feldspars, which was isolated and examined for\r\nspecific gravity and optical properties, was found to be sanidine.\r\nPhenocrysts of nepheline are more frequent than those of feldspar.\r\nThe mineral appears partly in the form of short-prismatic crystals,\r\npartly in rounded grains. It presents distinct cleavage, parallel to\r\n(1010) and to (0001), and the usually observed optical properties.\r\nIsolated grains are decomposed by hydrochloric acid with the separation\r\nof gelatinous silica; the resulting solution when evaporated gives\r\nnumerous cubes of NaCl. Inclusions are scarce; there are fluid cavities\r\nwith moving bubbles, generally arranged in rows, besides some pyroxene\r\ncrystals.\r\n\r\nApatite forms short and stout crystals always filled with inclusions\r\nof liquids. The opaque ore grains, judging by their ready solubility,\r\nbelong to magnetite. The groundmass of these rocks consists essentially\r\nof pyroxene in well-shaped prisms, lath-shaped feldspar, without\r\ntwinning lamination or in single twins according to the Carlsbad law\r\nand nepheline. The feldspar of the groundmass in all probability is\r\nmostly sanidine. Nepheline is abundant and occurs in well-shaped\r\ncrystals. Small patches of a colorless base occur between the\r\ncrystalline components.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the rocks is hypocrystalline-porphyritic on account\r\nof the occurrence of an isotropic base and the repetition of the\r\ncrystallization of pyroxene, nepheline and feldspar. Although the\r\nspecimens by their whole habit and structure belong under the head\r\nof nepheline-basanite poor in olivine, the presence of sanidine\r\nas phenocrysts causes them to form a transition to the group of\r\nphonolites. Unfortunately, analyses of these rocks have not yet been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nA microscopical examination of the basaltic rock from Pilot Knob, near\r\nAustin, Travis County, was made for the purpose of comparison with the\r\nrocks from southern Texas just described. The rock was found to be a\r\nnepheline-basalt porphyritic with numerous phenocrysts of olivine.\r\nThe fine grained groundmass consists essentially of augite-crystals\r\ncemented by non-individualized nepheline in very small amount.\r\n\r\n                    A. OSANN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME DYNAMIC PHENOMENA SHOWN BY THE BARABOO QUARTZITE RANGES OF CENTRAL\r\nWISCONSIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quartzite ranges of Baraboo extend east and west for about thirty\r\nmiles, one lying north, and the other, the main range, lying south of\r\nthe City of Baraboo. The geology of this district is admirably given by\r\nthe late Professor Irving.[8] Not only is the general geology clearly\r\ndescribed, but remarkably accurate descriptions are given of the\r\ncharacter of the quartzite, and the phenomena shown by it, considering\r\nthe fact that the report was written nearly twenty years since. The\r\nunconformity existing between the quartzite and the Cambrian was later\r\nmore fully described.[9] The induration of the Baraboo quartzite has\r\nbeen explained as due to the enlargement of the original quartz grains;\r\nand to the deposition of independent interstitial quartz.[10] The\r\npresent note is based upon recent observations on the East Bluff at\r\nDevil’s Lake and on the exposures at the Upper Narrows of the Baraboo\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nThe section across the ranges, as given by Irving, is shown by Fig. 1.\r\nThe two ranges together, as thus represented, are less than the north\r\nhalf of a great anticline, the south side of the south range being near\r\nits crown. This structure involves a very great thickness of quartzite,\r\nand was offered with reservation by Professor Irving. He says: “The\r\nhypothesis is not altogether satisfactory. The entire disappearance of\r\nthe other side of the great arch, as well as the peculiar ways in which\r\nthe ranges come together at their extremities are difficult to explain\r\nby it. It may be said in this connection that the dip observations\r\ntoward the west are not so satisfactory or numerous as they might be.”\r\nThe question naturally arises whether or not the great width of the\r\nranges in the central part of the area may not be partly explained by\r\nmonoclinal faulting, and thus reduce the supposed thickness of the beds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Ideal Sketch, showing structure and amount of\r\nerosion of the Baraboo Ranges.\r\n\r\nAfter Irving.\r\n\r\nScale natural, 12,000 feet to the inch.]\r\n\r\nThe layers of quartzite are ordinarily very heavy, but the changing\r\ncharacter of the original sediment is such as to make it easy to\r\nfollow the layers. Some beds were composed of fine grains of quartz,\r\nmingled with clayey material, others of coarse grains with little\r\nclayey material, and others of pebbles so large as to pass into an\r\nunmistakable conglomerate. The pebbles of the conglomerate are mainly\r\nwhite quartz and red jasper. It is thus easy to discriminate the\r\nbedding of the series from the heavy jointing which occurs, cutting\r\nthe bedding in various directions, and from a secondary cleavage and\r\nfoliation which occurs in certain localities.\r\n\r\nFrom the general work of many geologists on dynamic action in folding,\r\nit is to be expected that the amount of movement necessary for\r\naccommodation between beds, and consequently the dynamic metamorphism\r\nresulting from shearing, would be less near the crown of the anticline\r\nthan on the leg of the fold. That is, dynamic metamorphism ought\r\nnot to be so extensive in the south range as in the north range. The\r\nfacts described by Irving,[11] and those noted by me, fully agree with\r\nthis anticipation. The central parts of the heavy, little inclined\r\nbeds of the south range are largely indurated by simple enlargement.\r\nThe pressure has not been sufficient to obliterate the cores, but has\r\napparently granulated the exterior of some of the larger fragments, as\r\nin hand specimens the exteriors of the large blue quartz grains are\r\nwhite. Very generally the grains show slight wavy extinction. A few of\r\nthem are distinctly cracked. The crevices thus formed and those in the\r\ninterstices have been filled in large part by infiltrated silica, but\r\ntheir positions are plainly indicated by difference in extinction, by\r\nbubbles, by iron oxide, or by secondary mica which has taken advantage\r\nof the minute crevices.\r\n\r\nHowever, as described by Irving, between the heavy beds of quartzites\r\nare often layers, cut by a diagonal cleavage which dies out in passing\r\ninto the thick beds. The layers showing cleavage sometimes pass into\r\nthose showing the beginning of foliation, the rock then nearing a\r\nschist. In the centers of the schist zones, the schistosity approaches\r\nparallelism with the bedding, and in passing outward curves from this\r\ndirection until it crosses the bedding at an angle, at the same time\r\nbecoming less marked and grading into ordinary cleavage, which dies out\r\nin the quartzite. Upon the opposite side the transition is of the same\r\ncharacter, but the curve is in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nIrving apparently regarded these shear zones as originally beds of a\r\ndifferent character from the adjacent quartzite, and his conclusion is\r\nfully borne out by the thin sections. The microscope shows that the\r\ngrains of quartz are of small size, and separated to a greater or a\r\nless extent by interstitial clayey material. Because of this partial\r\nseparation of the grains of quartz, they have not been granulated to\r\nthe extent that one would expect from the schistosity of the rock, most\r\nof the original cores being plainly visible. They, however, often show\r\nwavy extinction and even cracks, but not to a greater degree than the\r\ngrains in the massive quartzite; for in the latter the full stress of\r\nthe pressure has been borne by the grains in full touch, not separated\r\nby a plastic matrix, as are the grains of quartz in the argillaceous\r\nlayers. In the matrix of the schist are numerous small flakes of\r\nmuscovite, arranged with their longer axes in a common direction, much\r\nfinely crystalline quartz, and a good deal of iron oxide.\r\n\r\nIt is concluded that the clayey character of the beds, and,\r\nconsequently, the greater ease of movement within them, has located the\r\nslipping-planes and shear-zones, necessary in order to accommodate the\r\nbeds to their new positions. On the south range, near Devil’s Lake,\r\nthese shear-zones are generally not more than six or eight inches\r\nwide. They may be well seen just back of the Cliff House, and on the\r\nNorthwestern Railway, about one-half mile south of this house. All of\r\nthese shear-zones are parallel with the bedding, and illustrate the\r\npossibility, so far as I know first mentioned by H. L. Smyth, that\r\na crystalline schist, with schistosity parallel to bedding, may be\r\nproduced by shearing along the bedding-planes.\r\n\r\nOn the railroad track, near the locality where these shear-zones may\r\nbe seen, is also an almost vertical shear-zone, two to four feet wide.\r\nIt therefore cuts almost directly across the beds of quartzite, which\r\nhere incline to the south about twelve or thirteen degrees. Throughout\r\nthis band, the quartzite is broken into angular trapezoidal fragments,\r\nthe longer directions of which are vertical, and which may be picked\r\nout with the hammer. In certain parts of the zone well-defined gruss\r\nor friction clay produced by the grinding of the fragments against one\r\nanother, has been produced. This is clearly a plane of faulting. How\r\nmuch the throw of this fault is it is not easy to say, as the heavy\r\nbeds of quartzite are so similar that it is impossible to certainly\r\nidentify them. At this place there is, however, a change in the\r\ncharacter of the quartzite, layers of light color being overlain by\r\nother beds, which are more heavily stained with iron oxide. This same\r\nsuccession is seen on both sides of the fault, and if beds of like\r\ncharacter correspond, the amount of the throw is twenty to thirty feet,\r\nand the south side has dropped relative to the north side. In other\r\nwords, the faulting is in the right direction to reduce the theoretical\r\nthickness of the sediments as given by Irving. The district has not\r\nbeen closely examined for other faults, but the existence of one fault,\r\neven of a minor character, suggests that a careful study of the whole\r\narea with reference to faulting should be made, in order to determine\r\nwhat deductions may possibly be made from Irving’s estimate of the\r\nprobable thickness of the quartzite.\r\n\r\nAt the upper narrows of the Baraboo, near Ablemans, we are on the north\r\nleg of the anticline. The dip is throughout from seventy to ninety to\r\nthe north, and in some places the layers are slightly overturned. The\r\nslipping along the bedding has here been much greater. While in this\r\narea there are heavy beds of quartzite which have not suffered great\r\ninterior movement, other beds have been sheared throughout, being\r\ntransformed macroscopically into a quartz-schist, but the foliation\r\nis strongly developed. In other places, as described by Irving,[12]\r\nwhere the rock is a purer quartzite, for a distance of 200 feet or more\r\nacross the strike, the rocks have been shattered through and through,\r\nand re-cemented by vein quartz.\r\n\r\nFor the most part the rock is merely fractured, the quartz fragments\r\nroughly fitting one another, but there are all gradations from this\r\nphase to a belt about ten feet wide of true friction conglomerate, the\r\nfragments having been ground against one another until they have become\r\nwell-rounded (a Reibungs breccia). Between the boulders of this zone\r\nis a matrix, composed mainly of smaller quartzite fragments. The whole\r\nhas been re-cemented, so that now the mass is completely vitreous. This\r\nbelt of friction conglomerate at first might not be discriminated from\r\nthe Potsdam conglomerate, immediately adjacent, but a closer study\r\nshows how radically different they are. In one the cementing material\r\nis vein-quartz; in the other the sandstone has been feebly cemented by\r\nquartz enlargement.\r\n\r\nA movement later than the one which produced the cemented fractured\r\nrocks and breccia has broken broad zones of the massive beds of\r\nquartzite into lozenge-shaped blocks, the longer axes of which are\r\nparallel to the bedding and movement. These later-formed blocks have\r\nnot been re-cemented by secondary quartz, and the cracks are taken\r\nadvantage of in quarrying, the fragments being easily picked apart.\r\nThus the rock has been affected by at least two dynamic movements,\r\nseparated by a considerable interval of time.\r\n\r\nThe shear-zones, often several feet in width, particularly affect the\r\nmore finely-laminated layers, which are lean in quartz, while the\r\nrelief in the more massive layers has resulted in complex fracturing.\r\nIn the first phase of production of the schist, the irregular fractures\r\npass into rather regular fractures, cutting the beds nearly at right\r\nangles. As the action becomes more intense in the more argillaceous\r\nbeds, the angle of fracture, or cleavage, as it may now fairly be\r\ncalled, becomes more acute, and in the most intense phase this cleaved\r\nrock passes into a well-developed schist, the foliation of which is\r\nparallel to the bedding. The phenomena of shearing are here therefore\r\nvery similar to those at Devil’s Lake, except that the process has gone\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\nWhen studied in thin section, the massive beds of quartzite show more\r\ndecided effects of dynamic action than at Devil’s Lake. However, the\r\nmajor portions of the grains of quartz have distinct cores which are\r\noften beautifully enlarged. In some cases nearly every grain has thus\r\ngrown, perfectly indurating the rock. But, also, nearly every grain of\r\nquartz has a wavy extinction, and many of them have been fractured,\r\nas mentioned of a few of the quartz grains of the quartzites of the\r\nsouth range. In one case the pressure has been so great as to produce\r\nrather numerous roughly parallel lines of fracture. It is thus seen\r\nthat the dynamic effects are not confined to the schist zones, but\r\nare also prominent within the heavy beds of quartzite. This was to\r\nbe expected; for while the major part of the accommodation necessary\r\nto bend the rock mass as a whole took place along the shear zones,\r\nthe accommodation required to bend each of the rigid heavy beds of\r\nquartzite must have taken place within each layer. To the consequent\r\nintense pressure and the rubbing of the grains over one another, are\r\nwholly attributed their wavy extinction and fractures.\r\n\r\nIn the schists of the shear zones, as at the south range, the thin\r\nsections show that the original quartz grains were small; interstitial\r\nmaterial was present, and mica has developed more largely than in the\r\nquartzite. However, in the most crystalline phases, the fragmental\r\ncores of the quartz grains and their frequent enlargements are plainly\r\nseen. Thus the shearing has not been sufficient to produce a completely\r\ncrystalline schist, although this would not be macroscopically\r\ndiscovered, unless it were suspected because the rock is not thinly\r\nfoliated.\r\n\r\nAs the dip of the quartzite is so steep at this locality, it is\r\ndifficult to say how far the shifting of the beds over one another\r\nlessens the apparent thickness. The shear zones as well as the friction\r\nconglomerates appear to be parallel to the bedding. If they are exactly\r\nso, this shearing action would necessitate an estimate of the original\r\nthickness greater than now shown, since the shear zones probably have\r\nless width at the present time than the beds from which they were\r\noriginally produced.\r\n\r\nCutting the bedding are heavy joints inclined to the north at an angle\r\nof 20° to 30°. If slipping had occurred along these in the right\r\ndirection, this might cause a small thickness of beds to have a great\r\napparent thickness. However, the schists above described weather out\r\non the face of the cliffs, and are therefore marked by recessions in\r\nthe walls. If slipping parallel to the jointing had occurred since the\r\nschists were formed, these depressions ought not to match on opposite\r\nsides of the joints; but, on the contrary, they continue unbroken from\r\nfoot to top, and probably the joints were formed simultaneously with or\r\nlater than the belts of schist. Consequently, at the upper narrows of\r\nthe Baraboo no evidence was found of faulting which could reduce the\r\nestimated thickness of the quartzite as given by Irving.\r\n\r\nAs Irving clearly saw, bearing strongly in favor of the theory of a\r\ngreat fold, is the increasing steeper dip of the layers in passing\r\nnorth. The phenomena of movement and metamorphism corresponding so\r\nexactly to those required by a simple fold, the question may be asked\r\nif these are not evidence of some weight in favor of the general\r\ncorrectness of Irving’s conclusion as to the structure. Had monoclinal\r\nfaulting extensively occurred, it would not have been necessary to have\r\nhad so great a readjustment of the beds as has been shown to occur by\r\nthe schists, cleavage, and the exceedingly intricate macro-fracturing\r\nand micro-fracturing of the rock beds and their constituent particles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the phenomena described by Irving, in summary, the\r\nBaraboo quartzite ranges show results of dynamic metamorphism as\r\nfollows: A fine example of the Reibungs Breccia may be seen. A fault\r\nzone of limited throw exists. All phases are exhibited, between a\r\nmassive quartzite, showing macroscopically little evidence of interior\r\nmovement through a rock exhibiting in turn fracture and cleavage, to\r\na rock which macroscopically is apparently a crystalline schist. The\r\nfoliation of the schists is parallel to the original stratification,\r\nbeing consequent upon the movements of the beds over one another,\r\nreadjustments occurring mainly in the softer layers. In thin sections\r\nthe schists still give clear evidence of their fragmental origin,\r\nbut also show the mechanical effects of interior movement. These\r\nsame effects are apparent within the heavy beds of quartzite, some\r\nreadjustment of the particles to their new positions being here also\r\nnecessary. There is no evidence that the semi-crystalline character\r\nof the schist and quartzite are due to high heat. Nowhere are the\r\nparticles fused. So far as they are destroyed it is by fracture, and\r\nthe rock is again healed by cementation.\r\n\r\nThe rock, in its most altered condition being a semi-crystalline\r\nschist, and in other parts showing less change, can be connected with\r\nits original state. Had the folding been more intense, it is reasonable\r\nto suppose that the entire rock would have been transformed into a\r\ncompletely crystalline quartz-schist, showing no evidence of clastic\r\norigin, and possibly the foliation throughout would have corresponded\r\nto the original bedding.\r\n\r\n                    C. R.

They are both derived\r\nprimarily from similar, and often from the same sources, and are in\r\nmany respects alike in their chemical behavior in nature. For these\r\nreasons it is to be expected that they would frequently, if not\r\ngenerally, be deposited in intimate association. Such is found to be\r\nthe case, and iron and manganese are often closely associated in the\r\nsame deposits. Very often, however, iron and manganese deposits occur\r\nclose together, but distinctly separated, while sometimes extensive\r\ndeposits of iron, and less commonly of manganese, occur with little or\r\nalmost no association with each other.\r\n\r\nIt is the object of the present paper to discuss the agencies which\r\nare instrumental in causing these substances to be deposited sometimes\r\ntogether and at other times separately. The subject is of interest as\r\nshowing how slight differences in the chemical behavior of their salts\r\nmay cause the almost complete separation of metals once intimately\r\nassociated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONNECTION OF IRON AND MANGANESE IN NATURE.\r\n\r\nA few words concerning the relation of manganese to iron in nature\r\nwill perhaps make the following discussion clearer. One of the most\r\ncommon modes of occurrence of manganese is with iron, though extensive\r\ndeposits containing manganese more or less free from iron often\r\noccur. When associated with iron, manganese occurs with it in various\r\nways. Sometimes the two are intimately mixed, so that they have the\r\nappearance of a homogeneous mass, resembling iron ore when iron is\r\nin the preponderance and manganese ore when manganese predominates.\r\nIn such cases there appears to be no tendency to combine in one fixed\r\nproportion, though, as iron is a much more abundant substance than\r\nmanganese, the mixture most commonly contains an excess of iron, and\r\nexists in the form of a manganiferous iron ore. The manganese, when\r\nnot intimately mixed with the iron, may occur in it in pockets or as\r\nscattered nodules and concretions. Such occurrences as those described\r\nare frequent in the Lake Superior iron region, the Appalachian Valley\r\nof the eastern states, in Nova Scotia, Arkansas, Colorado, New Mexico\r\nand innumerable other places. In Virginia very common occurrences are\r\nalternating layers of iron and manganese ore. The iron in such cases is\r\ngenerally in the larger quantities and the more continuous deposits;\r\nwhile the manganese is often represented by thin lenticular layers or\r\nby bands of nodules.\r\n\r\nFrom such cases, where iron predominates, there are all gradations\r\nin admixture, up to the rarer cases where manganese predominates.\r\nFrequently a given geologic horizon is characterized by both iron and\r\nmanganese, though in one case it may contain only iron, in another\r\nonly manganese, and in still another iron and manganese mixed in\r\nvarious proportions. A remarkable case of this is seen in the iron\r\nand manganese horizons immediately above, or a short distance above,\r\nthe Paleozoic quartzite, on the east side of the Appalachian Valley,\r\nespecially in the Valley of Virginia.[13] Here deposits of iron\r\nore, of manganese ore, and of both ores mixed, are found at various\r\npoints along the same geologic horizons. Similar alternations also\r\noccur in the Lower Silurian novaculites of the Ouachita Mountains of\r\nArkansas,[14] in Cebolla Valley, in Gunnison county, Colorado,[15] and\r\nin many other places. In many cases certain horizons are characterized\r\nover large areas by iron alone, and but little manganese, as is well\r\nseen in the Clinton formation and in the Tertiary iron-ore horizons of\r\nArkansas and Texas; while, on the other hand, some areas of certain\r\nhorizons contain considerable quantities of manganese and very little\r\niron, as is seen in parts of the Marine limestone in New Brunswick and\r\nNova Scotia, and also in parts of the metamorphosed Cretaceous shales\r\nof California.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOURCE OF IRON AND MANGANESE IN SEDIMENTARY ROCKS.\r\n\r\nThe iron and manganese contained in sedimentary strata may be\r\nconsidered as derived primarily from the decay of pre-existing rocks.\r\nSome of the later sedimentary rocks may have derived a part or all of\r\ntheir iron from older sedimentary rocks, which, in turn, had derived\r\ntheir iron and manganese from still older rocks. In this way the iron\r\nand manganese in a given geologic horizon may have formed a part of\r\nvarious older horizons before they reached their present resting place,\r\nbut, in every case, their primary source can be traced back to the\r\noriginal materials from which sedimentary rocks were first formed.\r\nIn certain cases the sea water has supplied a certain amount of iron\r\nand manganese to sedimentary rocks, but in such cases the sea water\r\nacts only as a carrier of these materials from the land areas or from\r\nsubmarine sources to the strata then forming.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSPORTATION OF IRON AND MANGANESE IN NATURE.\r\n\r\nThe process that goes on in this interchange of iron and manganese from\r\nolder to younger rocks is as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) The conversion, by surface agencies, of the minerals containing\r\niron and manganese into forms that can be taken into solution by\r\nsurface waters.\r\n\r\n(2) The solution of the iron and manganese in surface waters,\r\nacidulated with organic and sometimes inorganic acids, and their\r\ntransportation in this form from the areas of older rocks to areas over\r\nwhich younger rocks are being deposited.\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, the precipitation in one or more of several ways of the\r\niron and manganese contained in solution.\r\n\r\nThe iron and manganese thus chemically precipitated may be deposited\r\neither with mechanical sediments, such as sand, clay etc., or without\r\nthem. If the deposition of mechanical sediments is largely in excess\r\nof the precipitation of iron and manganese, the final products will be\r\nbeds of ferruginous shale, sandstone, etc., common in many geologic\r\nhorizons. If the precipitation of iron and manganese is in excess of\r\nthe deposition of mechanical sediments, the resulting products are\r\ndeposits of more or less pure iron and manganese ore. Between these\r\ntwo extremes there are all gradations in the admixture of the iron and\r\nmanganese with mechanical sediments.\r\n\r\nFrequently the iron and manganese which were originally finely\r\ndisseminated through shale, sandstone, etc., are subsequently\r\nconcentrated into bodies of comparatively pure ore, and very commonly\r\nthis concentration takes place by a process of re-solution of the iron\r\nand manganese and re-deposition by replacement with limestone, or,\r\nmore rarely, with some other material. The limestone or other material\r\nwhich thus acts as a precipitant is often in the same series of strata\r\nfrom which the iron and manganese were removed, and thus these two\r\nsubstances, which were once in a finely disseminated condition, may be\r\nconverted into deposits of comparatively pure ore and yet remain in the\r\nsame general series of strata in which they were originally deposited.\r\nA remarkable case of this is seen in the iron deposits of the Penokee\r\nseries in Michigan and Wisconsin,[16] to be mentioned again on page\r\n370. It has also been suggested by H. D. Rogers[17] that certain\r\nsiderite deposits in the Coal Measures were formed by the conversion\r\nof finely disseminated sesquioxide of iron into carbonate of iron by\r\norganic matter, and the subsequent segregation of the carbonate as now\r\nfound in layers and nodules.\r\n\r\nThe surface waters that carry the iron and manganese to the strata\r\nbeing deposited at a given time are sometimes derived from areas\r\nin which iron predominates, sometimes from areas in which iron and\r\nmanganese are both abundant, and sometimes, though rarely, on account\r\nof the scarcity of such regions, from areas in which manganese\r\nlargely predominates over iron. If iron and manganese were always\r\nprecipitated from these waters in similar chemical forms and under\r\nthe same conditions, it would be expected that the strata deriving\r\ntheir iron and manganese from surface waters would contain those\r\nsubstances in the same relative proportions as they had existed in\r\nthe rocks from which they were derived, and that they would be in an\r\nintimately mixed condition. Such is doubtless often the case, or at\r\nleast approximately so; but it is also often the case that iron and\r\nmanganese occur in separate deposits, yet in close proximity to each\r\nother and often alternating along the same horizon. Besides this, the\r\ntwo substances frequently form parts of the same deposit and yet are\r\ndistinctly separate from each other. In such cases the question arises\r\nas to why the iron and manganese are not intimately mixed in the form\r\nof a manganiferous iron ore, as would be expected if they had been\r\nprecipitated together. Moreover, deposits sometimes occur which are\r\ncomposed largely of manganese ore, with little or almost no iron, and\r\nwhen the source of the manganese is looked for, we often find that the\r\nrocks which probably supplied it contained both manganese and iron, and\r\nthat the iron was present in a much larger proportion as regards the\r\nmanganese than in the new deposit. Here again the question arises as to\r\nwhy the iron and manganese are not in the same relative proportions in\r\nthe new deposit as they were in the rocks from which they were derived.\r\n\r\nFour principal causes suggest themselves in explanation of this\r\nseparation:\r\n\r\n(1) It might be supposed that the deposits containing mostly iron and\r\nthose containing mostly manganese received these constituents from\r\nwaters derived from different sources, and carrying iron and manganese\r\nonly in the proportions in which they deposited them. Under some\r\nconditions this explanation might suffice, but in many cases, such as\r\nwhen iron and manganese alternate along the same geologic horizon, and\r\nyet in close proximity with each other, the explanation is entirely\r\ninadequate, for the deposits are too close to each other to have been\r\nformed from different supplies of surface waters.\r\n\r\n(2) It might be supposed that the iron or the manganese had been\r\nleached out of a deposit of the mixed ores, leaving one free from\r\nthe other and depositing the dissolved ore somewhere else. This\r\nexplanation, except in special cases, also appears inadequate, because\r\nthe reagents in surface waters, which dissolve iron and manganese, seem\r\nto affect both about equally, so that if one were dissolved, the other\r\nshould be taken up in the same way. Doubtless small differences could\r\nbe found in the behavior of the organic and inorganic compounds in\r\nsurface waters towards iron and manganese minerals, but they would be\r\nsmall as compared with the more active reactions which go on.\r\n\r\n(3) It might be supposed that a separation could be produced by\r\nsecondary concentration such as segregation, replacement, etc. This\r\nhas doubtless sometimes been the case, but where the concentrating\r\naction is not assisted by a difference in the chemical behavior of the\r\ntwo substances, the separation would only be on a small scale. Even\r\nin the case of concentration by replacement of limestone, if iron and\r\nmanganese both acted in the same way during the replacement, it would\r\nbe expected to find them deposited in an intimate mixture. Though this\r\nsecondary concentration, therefore, unassisted by other agencies, would\r\nnot produce all the results found in nature, yet, when it is thus\r\nassisted, it often plays an important part.\r\n\r\n(4) The fourth, and what seems the most important, factor in the\r\nseparation of iron and manganese, is that, though very often they are\r\nprecipitated in the same form from the same solution, yet sometimes\r\nthey are precipitated in different forms; and even when precipitated in\r\nthe same form, the precipitation of one sometimes requires different\r\nconditions from the precipitation of the other. This fact will explain\r\nthe alternate association and separation of iron and manganese, not\r\nonly when no secondary concentration has gone on, but also in cases\r\nwhere such concentration has taken place, such as in the replacement\r\nof limestone, etc.\r\n\r\nIt will now be attempted to show how the various degrees of association\r\nand separation of iron and manganese found in nature may be produced by\r\ndifferent conditions during deposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FORMS OF IRON AND MANGANESE DEPOSITED AT ORDINARY TEMPERATURES.\r\n\r\nThe mineralogical forms in which iron and manganese are deposited from\r\nsolution in nature at ordinary temperatures depend on the conditions\r\nof air and water, whether of an oxidizing or a reducing nature, and on\r\nthe character of the associated organic and inorganic matter either\r\nin solution or on the floor of the sea, lagoon or bog in which the\r\ndeposition occurs.[18] There are four principal methods by which iron\r\nand manganese are precipitated in nature from surface waters:\r\n\r\n(1) By oxidation, as in the case of the precipitation of hydrous oxides\r\nand in the precipitation of the carbonate by the partial oxidation of\r\nmore complex organic salts.[19]\r\n\r\n(2) By reduction, as in the precipitation of sulphide of iron by the\r\nreduction of sulphate of iron.\r\n\r\n(3) By gaseous or soluble precipitants, as in the precipitation of\r\nsulphide of iron by the action of sulphuretted hydrogen or a soluble\r\nsulphide on a soluble salt of iron, and as in other cases to be\r\nmentioned later.\r\n\r\n(4) By replacement of carbonate of lime or some other substance.\r\nDifferent forms are precipitated by these different methods.\r\n\r\nIron at ordinary temperatures is usually deposited from solution as\r\nthe hydrous sesquioxide, the carbonate, the sulphide or the hydrous\r\nsilicate of iron and potash known as glauconite. Manganese under\r\nsimilar conditions is deposited as the hydrous oxide[20] or as the\r\ncarbonate, and possibly sometimes, though very rarely, as sulphide.\r\n\r\nWhen solutions of organic or inorganic salts of iron and manganese are\r\nfreely exposed to the action of air, as in shallow or rapidly moving\r\nstreams, or in lakes and some bogs, they are quickly oxidized and\r\nboth may be deposited as more or less hydrous oxides. In many bogs,\r\nhowever, the metals may be precipitated as hydrous oxide on the surface\r\nwhere oxidizing agencies predominate, but when these oxides sink and\r\ncome into contact with decaying organic matter, free from the active\r\noxidizing influences of the air, they may be reduced to carbonates.\r\n\r\nThe carbonates of iron and manganese may be precipitated when the\r\nsolutions containing them are protected from oxidation by a reducing\r\nagent, such as decaying organic matter, or by being far removed from\r\nthe air. Carbonate of manganese, however, is a much more stable\r\ncompound than carbonate of iron, and the oxidizing conditions are\r\noften sufficiently strong to cause the deposition of iron as hydrous\r\nsesquioxide and not strong enough to change the manganese from its\r\ncarbonate form. It is not uncommon, therefore, to have iron deposited\r\nin one place as hydrous sesquioxide, and manganese carried further on\r\nand deposited as carbonate, or even under special conditions deposited\r\nas carbonate with the hydrous sesquioxide of iron. Fresenius[21] has\r\nshown that the warm springs of Wiesbaden, which contain iron and\r\nmanganese among their other mineral constituents, deposit iron in the\r\nform of hydrous sesquioxide, while manganese is carried on further\r\nin solution and deposited as carbonate. In this behavior, therefore,\r\nwe have the first striking difference in the deposition of iron and\r\nmanganese, and it will be further discussed later on.\r\n\r\nThe sulphides of iron and manganese differ very much in their nature\r\nand mode of occurrence. Iron is frequently deposited as sulphide, but\r\nmanganese rarely occurs in that form, and when it does it is always in\r\nvery small quantities. Iron forms several sulphides in nature: pyrite\r\n(FeS₂), marcasite (FeS₂),[22] pyrrhotite (Fe₁₁S₁₂), troilite (FeS) and\r\nnumerous other more complex compounds unnecessary to enumerate here.\r\nPyrite is the commonest form of iron sulphide, and occurs in rocks of\r\nall ages, from Archean to Recent. It is formed in nature by the action\r\nof soluble sulphides or sulphuretted hydrogen on soluble salts of iron,\r\nand also by the reduction of sulphate of iron by organic matter or\r\nother reducing agents. Manganese forms two[23] sulphides, alabandite\r\n(MnS) and hauerite (MnS₂). Both minerals are very rare, and so unstable\r\nthat they rapidly oxidize on exposure. Alabandite is the less rare\r\nform, and usually occurs as a subordinate constituent of certain\r\nmetalliferous veins or allied deposits.\r\n\r\nThough the sulphides of manganese are easily oxidized, they are\r\nnot so unstable that, had they ever been formed in considerable\r\nquantities in sedimentary deposits, they would, even at considerable\r\ndepths, have left no trace of their former presence. Moreover, the\r\nsulphide of manganese, as produced artificially,[24] is soluble in\r\ncertain organic acids, notably acetic, and, as the conditions for the\r\ndeposition of sulphides of metals in sedimentary deposits generally\r\nrequire the presence of organic matter, it is not improbable that some\r\nof the acids given off by such matter would be capable of dissolving\r\nsulphide of manganese. Here, then, is one reason why manganese might\r\nnot be deposited as sulphide under some conditions which would cause\r\nthe precipitation of sulphide of iron. Moreover, the artificial\r\nformation of sulphide of manganese (alabandite) in the laboratory is\r\nbrought about most easily at high temperatures. It has also been\r\nnoted that when manganese, in the form of the alloys spiegeleisen and\r\nferro-manganese, is added to molten steel, it bodily removes a part of\r\nthe sulphur; and it is thought by some metallurgists, that sulphide of\r\nmanganese is formed and carried into the slag.\r\n\r\nThese and other indications of the more easy transition of manganese\r\ninto the form of sulphide at high rather than at low temperatures\r\nafford another cause which might prevent sulphide of manganese from\r\nbeing formed in sedimentary deposits, for such deposits are usually\r\nlaid down at ordinary temperatures. On the other hand, they also\r\nafford a cause which might lead to the deposition of the sulphide of\r\nmanganese in certain metalliferous veins and other deposits, where the\r\ntemperature at the time of deposition may have been high.\r\n\r\nIn many of the silver and lead deposits of the Rocky Mountains\r\nmanganese oxides occur with the superficial oxidation products of the\r\nsulphides of other metals, and it has often been suggested that the\r\nmanganese also was originally in the form of sulphide. This may be true\r\nin some cases, for alabandite has been found in a few metalliferous\r\ndeposits in Colorado, Mexico, Germany, Peru and elsewhere, but in most\r\ncases, at least in the Rocky Mountains, when the level is reached at\r\nwhich the oxidized forms of lead, zinc, iron and other metals pass into\r\nsulphides, the manganese passes into carbonate or silicate, and remains\r\nin one or both of those forms to all depths that have been reached.\r\n\r\nIn the deposition of iron and manganese as sulphide, therefore, there\r\nis a most marked difference of behavior, and here again is a good cause\r\nfor the separation of the two substances in sedimentary rocks, as will\r\nbe more fully explained below.\r\n\r\nIron is often deposited in sedimentary formations as the hydrous\r\nsilicate of iron and potash known as glauconite, and composes the\r\nmass of the large greensand beds common in Cretaceous and Tertiary\r\nstrata; but manganese is not found in an exactly similar condition.[25]\r\nHere again, therefore, is an important difference in the modes of\r\ndeposition of iron and manganese, which also will be mentioned again.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that while some of the forms in which iron and\r\nmanganese are deposited are the same, others differ very widely, and\r\neven similar forms are often deposited under different conditions.\r\nIt is doubtless to these various forms and conditions of deposition\r\nthat the alternate association and separation of iron and manganese in\r\nnature are due.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF THE ASSOCIATION OF IRON AND MANGANESE.\r\n\r\nThe very frequent intimate association of iron and manganese in\r\nsedimentary rocks is what would be expected from a deposition as oxide\r\nor carbonate in basins such as coastal lagoons or bogs, where the\r\nwaters moved very slowly, or not at all, for under such conditions,\r\nthey are often deposited together.[26] Moreover, it is a well-known\r\nfact that isomorphous substances have a strong tendency to combine in a\r\nhomogeneous mass, and to crystallize together in different proportions.\r\nCarbonate of iron and of manganese are isomorphous with each other,\r\nand this is hence a possible cause of the frequent intimacy of their\r\nassociation, such as is seen in almost all manganiferous spathic iron\r\nores, whether these ores are formed by direct precipitation or by\r\nreplacement of carbonate of lime. The oxidation of such a mixture would\r\ngive the common form of an intimately combined iron and manganese ore.\r\n\r\nSince there is usually more iron than manganese in the rocks from which\r\nboth metals were originally derived, the surface waters draining from\r\nareas of such rocks usually contain the metals in a similar proportion.\r\nHence, in cases where the deposition of the carbonates of both occurs\r\nat the same spot, the isomorphous carbonates derived from the solutions\r\nhave a larger percentage of carbonate of iron than of carbonate of\r\nmanganese, and the resulting oxides contain the two metals in the same\r\nproportion, thus giving rise to the common low-manganese iron ores.\r\n\r\nThe hydrous oxides of iron and manganese, however, are not\r\nisomorphous,[27] and, therefore, when they are precipitated together,\r\nas in bog-deposits, the association is often much less intimate than\r\nin the cases just mentioned, and is simply due to the fact that, under\r\ncertain conditions, the oxides of both metals are precipitated in the\r\nsame place.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF THE SEPARATION OF IRON AND MANGANESE.\r\n\r\nWhen iron and manganese ores occur in more or less separate deposits,\r\nit becomes necessary to suppose the action of influences different from\r\nthose which cause the deposition of both together, and such influences\r\nare to be found in the different modes of precipitation, under certain\r\nconditions, of the two metals. It has been shown by Fresenius[28] that\r\ncertain warm springs, on reaching the surface, first deposit hydrous\r\nsesquioxide of iron, and farther on carbonate of manganese. This not\r\nonly points to the well-known fact that carbonate of iron is more\r\neasily oxidized than carbonate of manganese, but it also leads to the\r\nbelief that the bicarbonate or other salt of iron in the water is more\r\neasily oxidized than the manganese salt.\r\n\r\nAn action somewhat similar to that described by Fresenius readily\r\nexplains the occurrence of manganese sometimes in entirely separate\r\ndeposits, sometimes in distinct but closely alternating deposits.[29]\r\nUnder certain conditions, if the waters from which the precipitation\r\ntook place were moving, the iron and manganese, owing to the difference\r\nin oxidability, as stated above, would be laid down in different\r\nplaces, resulting in the formation of deposits of iron ore free from\r\nmanganese, and manganese ore free from iron in different positions\r\nalong the plane of the same geologic horizon. Such occurrences are\r\noften seen in the iron regions of the Appalachian Valley, where there\r\nare often found, in different places along the same belt, deposits\r\nof iron ore and deposits of manganese ore in positions similar with\r\nrelation to the enclosing rocks.\r\n\r\nThese conditions of moving water might also cause the occurrence of\r\nthe two ores in interstratified layers, as is sometimes the case. Such\r\na condition would result if iron were deposited in a certain place at\r\none time, and if, later, on account of some increased facility for\r\noxidation, iron was deposited before it reached that place, and the\r\nmanganese, being less easily precipitated, were carried on and laid\r\ndown upon the first deposit of iron.\r\n\r\nSuppose the metalliferous solutions to be confined in a shallow\r\nbasin, or, at least, to pass through it so slowly that they become\r\nthoroughly oxidized. Under such conditions the deposition of iron and\r\nmanganese would go on continuously, and so nearly on the same spot that\r\na comparatively homogeneous manganiferous iron ore would be formed.\r\nIf the supply of metalliferous solutions were not continuous, but\r\nwere intermittent, as is sometimes the case in local basins, such as\r\ncoastal lagoons, which are often dependent for their supply of water\r\non the changes of season and the sudden fluctuations of weather, then\r\ninterstratified layers of iron and manganese ore might be produced. The\r\niron, becoming oxidized on the surface, sinks to the bottom, possibly\r\nin some cases to be converted there to the simple carbonate by organic\r\nmatter. Further oxidation precipitates hydrous oxide or carbonate of\r\nmanganese on top of the iron. A renewed supply of surface waters brings\r\nmore solutions of iron and manganese, or else the evaporation of the\r\nwater in the closed basin concentrates the materials which have not\r\nyet been precipitated. In either case there is a further alternate\r\ndeposition of the two ores.[30]\r\n\r\nAnother process of separation of iron and manganese in nature might\r\ntake place by the formation of sulphide of iron. It has already been\r\nshown that iron is sometimes deposited as sulphide and later oxidized\r\nin the same manner as the carbonate. Manganese, on the other hand,\r\nis rarely found as sulphide, and there is reason to think that the\r\nsulphide never represented the original form of any large sedimentary\r\ndeposits of manganese ore (see pages 364 to 365). It seems probable,\r\ntherefore, that from a solution of iron and manganese in surface waters\r\nthe iron might, where the conditions are favorable, be precipitated\r\nas sulphide (FeS₂) and the manganese might be carried on in solution\r\nto be deposited somewhere else as oxide or carbonate. Subsequently\r\nthe oxidation of the ores would give rise to oxide of iron from the\r\nsulphide and oxide of manganese from the carbonate; and the two ores,\r\nthough occurring at the same horizon, would be separated by a greater\r\nor less distance.\r\n\r\nAfter the deposition of the sulphide of iron, the conditions might\r\nchange and permit the deposition, in the same place, of the carbonates\r\nof iron and manganese together. This is an easy case to imagine, and\r\nwhere such a deposit was exposed to surface influences, the resulting\r\nproduct would be oxide of iron from the underlying sulphide and a\r\nmanganiferous iron oxide from the overlying isomorphous carbonates.\r\nHence another possible cause of the frequent association of pure iron\r\nores and manganiferous iron ores. It is possible also that after the\r\nsolution of iron and manganese had been freed from the former by\r\nprecipitation as sulphide, the manganese might be carried on and laid\r\ndown as carbonate on a previous deposit of iron sulphide, and when such\r\na combination was oxidized, the result would be oxide of iron and oxide\r\nof manganese in beds closely associated but yet distinct.\r\n\r\nBy supposing the iron sometimes to be deposited in sea water as\r\nglauconite, a manner in which manganese is not laid down (see page\r\n365), a further means of separation of the two metals would result.\r\n\r\nThus by alternating the conditions of the deposition of iron and\r\nmanganese in different forms, a great variety of methods of association\r\nand separation of the two metals can be produced.\r\n\r\nThe above discussion refers not only to the deposits of iron and\r\nmanganese ores of notable size, but also to the iron and manganese\r\nfrequently found disseminated through shales, sandstones etc. In these\r\nrocks they usually form a small but often a very important part, for in\r\nmany cases the iron and manganese is taken into solution from the rocks\r\nand redeposited by a process of replacement with carbonate of lime\r\nin neighboring beds of limestone, or more rarely by replacement with\r\nother rocks, thus giving rise to important ore deposits. The question\r\nof the association and separation of the iron and manganese in these\r\nreplacement deposits depends on a number of conditions, the principal\r\nof which are, just as in the class of deposits that has been discussed,\r\nthe conditions during deposition and the forms in which the iron and\r\nmanganese are precipitated. The processes by which association and\r\nseparation occur in replacement deposits differ somewhat in detail from\r\nthe processes just discussed, but are based on the same principles.\r\n\r\nMany of the iron and manganese deposits of the Appalachian region are\r\nsupposed by many to be replacement deposits. N. S. Shaler[31] in 1877\r\nsuggested that some of the iron deposits of Kentucky and Ohio were\r\nformed by the solution of iron from certain rocks, and its deposition\r\nin the form of carbonates by replacement with underlying limestone.\r\nSubsequently it was changed by oxidation to brown hematite. A notable\r\ncase of replacement has also been shown by R. D. Irving and C. R. Van\r\nHise[32] in the iron deposits of the Penokee series of Michigan and\r\nWisconsin. Here the ore is supposed to be partly a replacement of chert\r\nin a trough between quartzite and igneous rocks. The solution that\r\ncontained the iron was derived from strata in the same series of rocks\r\nin which the iron was re-deposited and contained a certain amount of\r\nmanganese. It is shown how the iron and manganese were more or less\r\nseparated in the replacement process and that the separation was due\r\nto the difference in the oxidability of the carbonates as explained on\r\npage 363.\r\n\r\n                    R. A. F. PENROSE, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n   [13] The exact age of the iron and manganese deposits here referred\r\n        to is, in some cases, a little uncertain. Some may be Cambrian,\r\n        others Silurian, but the exact determination of the age of the\r\n        horizon is not a part of the present discussion.

Sci., Vol. XXVIII., 1879, p. 356) that in some cases the\r\n        carbonates of iron and manganese may be only the fixed residue\r\n        of organic compounds of more complex form once in solution in\r\n        surface waters.\r\n\r\n   [20] This oxide is generally in the form of the peroxide or the\r\n        sesquioxide in a more or less hydrous condition.\r\n\r\n   [21] Jahrb. des Vereins f.

(See System of Mineralogy,\r\n        E. S.

Therefore, before classifying the rivers of Connecticut,\r\nI shall consider the topography of the state, and in a few paragraphs\r\noutline the successive cycles in the history of its growth. The scope\r\nof this article will not permit a discussion or even a full statement\r\nof the evidence on which these conclusions are based. They have been\r\nstated at considerable length by Professor W. M. Davis,[34] and the\r\nreader is referred to his papers for the complete discussion. His\r\nconclusions in respect to the physical geography are accepted here\r\nwithout question, and form the basis for the discussion on the rivers\r\nof the state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 2]\r\n\r\n_Topography of Connecticut._ Connecticut can be said to consist of two\r\ngreat areas quite distinct in topography and geologic structure.[35] On\r\nthe east and on the west are the crystalline uplands which rise from\r\nsea level along the Sound to 1,700 and 1,800 feet in the northwestern\r\npart of the state, and to 600 and 700 feet in the northeastern.\r\nThese uplands consist chiefly of gneiss and granite, probably of\r\npre-Paleozoic age, which are now much folded, faulted and crumpled.\r\nBetween these two areas of crystallines is a lowland belt of Triassic\r\nsandstone and shale, twenty to twenty-five miles wide, extending from\r\nNew Haven north through the center of the state and including in its\r\nborders New Haven, Meriden, Hartford, New Britain and many towns of\r\nlesser note. These sandstones form a monocline with an eastward dip\r\nof 10° to 30°, and in addition to being tilted they have been faulted\r\nsince their deposition in a shallow, slowly-subsiding trough of\r\ncrystallines. Their thickness is variously estimated--3,000 to 5,000\r\nfeet, Dana; 10,000 or more, Davis. This lowland is interrupted by a\r\nseries of trap ridges, which in general present steep faces toward the\r\nwest, whereas their eastward slope is gradual, less than the dip of the\r\nsandstones.\r\n\r\n_The upland plateau._ Suppose we ascend the highest point of these trap\r\nridges, the old tower on Talcott Mt., nine miles west of Hartford; we\r\nare 900 feet above the sea level and more than 600 above the plain at\r\nour feet. A few miles to the west across the sandstone valley, rise the\r\ncrystalline uplands, which extend far to the north and to the south.\r\nOn the east across the Connecticut we see the eastern uplands. The\r\nfirst impression, which comes to one as he gazes upon these uplands\r\nand which is strengthened with each view, is that few hills rise above\r\nthe general level of the plateau; the crest line is nearly horizontal,\r\ndeclining gently to Long Island Sound. Above this general level are\r\na few rounded domes, but no sharp, towering peaks. Below it valleys\r\nhave been cut, but they do not destroy the plateau-like appearance. A\r\nview from the western plateau across the sandstone valley shows the\r\nremarkably even crest line of the trap ridges, a crest line which\r\napproximates in height the uplands on the east and west. A nearer view\r\nof the upland corroborates our first impressions of the gently rolling\r\ncharacter of the inter-stream surfaces, but we have a better view of\r\nthe valleys which have been sunk beneath the general level and of the\r\nlow rounded hills which rise above it. In popular parlance the country\r\nis “hilly.” It is uneven, not because there are high hills, but rather\r\nbecause there are deep valleys. If in imagination we fill up these\r\nvalleys and the wide Triassic lowland to the general level of the broad\r\ninter-stream surfaces, we shall have constructed a gently undulating\r\nplateau, dipping to the south and east--a peneplain.[36]\r\n\r\n_Origin of the peneplain._ This is not a constructional surface,\r\nfor the rocks are greatly tilted, folded and faulted, so that the\r\nsurface consequent upon such disturbance must have been complex and\r\nmountainous. Long subaërial denudation upon a folded and faulted\r\nmass when the land stood much lower than at present produced this\r\nplateau. Evidently it could be produced by denudation only at or near\r\nbaselevel, for the effect of erosion upon a mass high above baselevel\r\nis to accentuate its topographic relief, not to reduce it. We naturally\r\nask ourselves, “At what stage in geologic history did this denudation\r\noccur?”\r\n\r\n_Date of the peneplain._ The erosion which accomplished this great\r\nwork must have commenced after the formation and dislocation of the\r\nTriassic beds, for the even crest line of the trap ridges, a part of\r\nwhich--perhaps all--were contemporaneous with the sandstones, is a part\r\nof the dissected peneplain; but to fix the date of the completion of\r\nthe peneplain, we must turn to evidence presented in New Jersey.[37]\r\nThere we learn that by the close of Cretaceous times, the country was\r\neroded nearly to baselevel, and we may therefore speak of the relative\r\nposition of the land and sea, to which the land was at this time\r\nreduced, as the Cretaceous baselevel, and this land surface as the\r\nCretaceous peneplain.\r\n\r\n_Elevation of the peneplain._ In post-Cretaceous, presumably early\r\nTertiary[38] times, the land was elevated to nearly its present height\r\nand remained at that altitude, so far as topographic evidence shows,\r\nduring Tertiary times. The proofs of this elevation are the valleys\r\nwhich the streams have sunk below the general level. That this was\r\nnot a simple uplift, but was accompanied with tilting and warping, is\r\nclear from the following considerations. The depth to which a stream\r\ncan cut its valley depends directly upon its height above baselevel.\r\nIf the present surface were a peneplain uniformly elevated, the head\r\nwaters and middle courses of a river would not be cut so deep in the\r\nsurrounding plain as its lower course. But the reverse is true of the\r\nrivers of Connecticut. The depth of the valley increases inland, being\r\ngreater in those regions where the peneplain was raised the highest. A\r\ncomparison of the upper and lower valleys of the Housatonic, Naugatuck,\r\nQuinnebaug, and of the Connecticut at Middletown, where it enters the\r\nplateau, and at its mouth, will give some idea of the amount of the\r\nwarping. It will not give an _exact measure_ of it for several reasons:\r\nfirst, the upper courses of the rivers have not yet reached the present\r\nbaselevel; second, the present altitude of the uplands is the result\r\nof the post-Cretaceous uplift and warping, plus a probable later\r\npost-Tertiary uplift (to be mentioned later), besides several minor\r\noscillations, the last of which was downward, and is recorded near the\r\ncoast in the drowned condition of the rivers. As has been already said,\r\nthe peneplain is highest in the northwest, and gradually declines to\r\nsea level toward the south and east.\r\n\r\n_Consequences of the uplift._ The consequences of this uplift are\r\nseen in the valleys, which are cut into the peneplain, and which have\r\ndestroyed the level character of the country. In the hard crystalline\r\nrocks the valleys are generally narrow and deep, with bold slopes;[39]\r\nwhere they are cut in the crystalline limestone, they are wider and\r\nmore open. In marked contrast, however, is the lowland on the Triassic\r\narea in which only the trap ridges remain to tell of the former\r\naltitude of the general surface, and the immense amount of erosion\r\nwhich has taken place on the soft sandstones and shales. Indeed erosion\r\nhas progressed so rapidly on these soft rocks, that they have been worn\r\ndown almost to a new baselevel in the same length of time in which the\r\nhard crystallines have been only trenched. This fact cannot be too\r\nstrongly emphasized. The broad sandstone lowland from New Haven north\r\ninto Massachusetts has been carved out of the uplifted peneplain in\r\nsoft rocks, during the same time in which the Connecticut has excavated\r\nits gorge in the crystallines below Middletown, and the Housatonic has\r\nopened its upland valley on the limestones. The difference in results\r\nis due not to a difference of time, but to the difference in the\r\nrelative hardness of the rocks.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of this principle the age of certain river gorges to which\r\nreference will be made later can be fixed. The _narrow_ passage of\r\nthe Quinnipiac through a sandstone ridge southwest of Meriden cannot\r\nbelong to the same cycle of erosion as the _broad sandstone lowland_\r\non either side of it, but manifestly must be much younger. So, also,\r\nthe narrow passage of the Farmington at Tariffville, where it crosses\r\nthe trap ridge through a gorge free from drift, is of much later date\r\nthan the _broader_ valley more or less encumbered with drift which the\r\nupper part of the same river has cut in the hard crystalline schists.\r\nCook’s Gap in the trap sheet west of New Britain is much broader than\r\neither of the above, and belongs to the Tertiary cycle of erosion,\r\nalthough as I shall endeavor to show later, it was probably not\r\noccupied by a stream during the whole cycle. In marked contrast, also,\r\nwith the Tariffville gorge is the gap by which the Westfield river in\r\nMassachusetts cuts the trap ridge. This gap was formerly broad and\r\nopen--the result of Tertiary erosion--but is now filled with drift,\r\nin which the river is at present working. Since these two rivers are\r\nessentially the same in size, are now at the same level, and the rock\r\nis the same in both cases, the only explanation for the difference in\r\nthe two passages is that they belong to different cycles.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, the results of the post-Cretaceous uplift are seen in\r\nthe valleys which have been cut in the peneplain. The narrow valleys\r\nin the gneisses and schists, the upland valleys in the limestones, the\r\nwide open, drift encumbered gaps in the trap ridge,--Cook’s and the\r\nWestfield river gaps,--the broad open lowland on the sandstones, are\r\nall the result of erosion in this cycle. The Quinnipiac gorge in the\r\nsandstone, and the Tariffville gorge in the trap are just as surely of\r\na later date. They do not at all accord with the work of the earlier\r\ncycle either in size, angle of slope, or depth.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is somewhat at variance with an opinion expressed by\r\nProfessor J. D. Dana,[40] but it seems justifiable in view of the\r\nsuccessive cycles in the physical development of the region. In another\r\npart of this article I shall consider these gaps again in connection\r\nwith their river histories, and shall give additional reasons why I\r\nventure to differ from so eminent an authority.\r\n\r\n_Length of this cycle._ This cycle of erosion beginning with the\r\npost-Cretaceous uplift was not so long as the preceding cycle. In\r\nthe earlier one the whole state was reduced to a peneplain; in the\r\nlater cycle only the soft Triassic sandstones were brought near to\r\nbaselevel. It probably lasted through Tertiary times, and was brought\r\nto a close by a slight uplift. The result of this uplift is well\r\nshown in Pennsylvania[41] and New Jersey.[42] It is not well shown in\r\nConnecticut, but there seem to be some traces of it in the trenches the\r\nrivers have cut below the level of the sandstone peneplain. However,\r\nthese trenches are so much obscured by drift that a positive statement\r\nis not warranted. It may, however, be spoken of provisionally as the\r\npost-Tertiary uplift. There may have been later oscillations of small\r\namount, probably were; here and there are shreds of evidence which\r\npoint to such oscillations, but only one movement has had an effect\r\nupon the topography, which can be recognized. The fjorded condition\r\nof all the rivers along the Sound--the Norwalk, Saugatuck, New Haven\r\nbay, Niantic and Thames are the best examples--shows that within\r\ncomparatively recent time there has been a slight subsidence of the\r\nland. But this movement is not to be compared in amount with those of\r\nthe earlier cycles.\r\n\r\n_The drift._ Over all the state in varying thickness lies the glacial\r\ndrift, either in its typical unmodified development as till, or in its\r\nmodified form, as river terraces, kames, eskers and sand-plains. It is\r\nof importance in this connection only as it has affected the topography\r\nof the country and so modified the drainage. Examples of these\r\nmodifications will be mentioned later.\r\n\r\n_Résumé._ There was first a long cycle of denudation in pre-Triassic\r\ntimes, during which the contorted crystallines were worn down to a\r\ncomparative level; second, a cycle of subsidence, deposition and\r\nvolcanic outburst, during which the sea entered the crystalline\r\ntrough, and the Triassic conglomerates, sandstones and shales were\r\ndeposited with the intercalated layers of lava; third, a long cycle of\r\nelevation, folding, faulting and erosion, during which the sedimentary\r\nbeds were elevated--tilted into the present faulted monocline, and\r\nthis constructional surface worn down to a baselevel of erosion in\r\nlate Cretaceous times. Each of these cycles probably represents\r\nthe sum total of several subordinate cycles. There was, fourth, a\r\npost-Cretaceous uplift inaugurating a period of erosion lasting\r\nthrough Tertiary times and resulting in the formation of valleys in\r\nthe hardest rocks, and a lowland approaching baselevel on the Triassic\r\nsandstones and shales; fifth, a probable late or post-Tertiary uplift,\r\nwhen the valleys were deepened and the lowlands trenched--obscure in\r\nConnecticut, but well shown farther south; sixth, the land, near the\r\ncoast at least, is now slightly lower than it has been in the not\r\nremote past, as is shown by the fjords.\r\n\r\nWith the changes of the physical geography clearly in mind, the rivers\r\nof Connecticut may now be examined in respect to their conditions of\r\norigin, the number of cycles through which they have lived, and the\r\napproach they have made to mature old age. But at the very outset a\r\nserious difficulty is encountered, for the geological structure of\r\nthe state is nowhere well described, nor have topographic maps of\r\nall the districts yet been issued. Since the structural details are\r\nto some extent unknown it is unwise in many cases to attempt more\r\nthan tentative conclusions. Several of the problems to be presented\r\ncannot be considered as settled. Considerable progress toward a\r\nfinal settlement will have been made, however, if the conditions of\r\nthe problems are made clear, various hypotheses suggested, and the\r\nattention of workers in this field called to these questions.\r\n\r\n_Early drainage._ Of the drainage of Connecticut during Jurassic and\r\nCretaceous times very little can be said. It is not even known whether\r\nit was consequent upon the Jurassic tilting and faulting, or whether\r\nthese deformations were so slow in their movement that the rivers\r\npersisted in spite of them. It may have been that the larger rivers\r\nwere victorious, while the smaller were conquered and compelled to\r\nassume new consequent courses. Whatever was their origin there must\r\nhave been abundant opportunities during the long erosion which resulted\r\nin the Cretaceous baselevel, and again in the period of revived and\r\nquickened degradation succeeding the post-Cretaceous uplift, for the\r\nstreams to adjust themselves in a large degree to the geological\r\nstructure. The contrast of hard and soft beds and the great elevation\r\nmust have been potent factors in bringing to pass such a result. We\r\nexpect to find the streams so far re-adjusted as to render improbable\r\nthe discovery of their manner of origin.\r\n\r\n_The Housatonic, a re-adjusted stream._ The best example of\r\nre-adjustment is found in the northwestern part of the state where the\r\nHousatonic and some of its branches follow well adjusted courses. From\r\nits headwaters, near Pittsfield, Mass., to New Milford, Conn., it has\r\nnearly all the way chosen its course along the Cambrian crystalline\r\nlimestones in preference to the harder granites and gneisses on either\r\nside. The stratigraphical relationships of the limestone are not fully\r\nunderstood, but they seem to be deeply eroded anticlines and synclines,\r\nwhose axes plunge north or south at various angles. The course of\r\nthe river, if the drainage was consequent, was at first along the\r\nsynclinal valleys, passing from one to another across the lowest points\r\nin the anticlinal ridge between them. But by a series of changes[43],\r\nresulting from the differential rates of erosion as hard or soft beds\r\nbecame exposed, the river previously to the Cretaceous baseleveling,\r\nseems to have re-adjusted its course to the softer limestones. However,\r\nthere are several places where this conformity to structure does not\r\nseem to be the law; where the river departs from a limestone valley to\r\nflow for a time in the crystallines, only to return to the limestone\r\nagain. The most marked instance of this is in the towns of Sharon and\r\nCornwall, where the river leaves the limestone valley, which continues\r\nto the southwest, and flows for ten miles in a narrow gorge in the\r\ngneiss, only to again enter at its northern end a long narrow bed of\r\nlimestone. The following seems to be the probable explanation. When the\r\nland stood at the elevation represented by the Cretaceous peneplain,\r\nthese hard beds were below or but very slightly above baselevel, and\r\nwere therefore undiscovered by the stream or had just begun to make\r\nthemselves known late in the cycle. Had they been reached early in the\r\ncycle, when the stream was far above baselevel and presumably before\r\nmany of its tributaries had been developed, and when it was therefore a\r\nsmaller river, it is quite probable that further re-adjustments would\r\nhave occurred, and the stream been led away from the hard rocks onto\r\nthe softer beds to the west; but when they were reached the stream\r\nhad cut so deeply and so nearly to baselevel that it was safe from\r\ncapture. After the elevation of the peneplain the stream was revived\r\nand disclosed more and more of these hard beds, but was then, owing to\r\nthe development and head-water growth of its tributaries, too important\r\na river to be diverted by any rival. A river of this kind may be\r\nsaid to be “conformably superimposed” in distinction to one which is\r\nsuperimposed from an unconformable cover.\r\n\r\n_Revived streams._ It is important to recognize the effect of the\r\npost-Cretaceous uplift upon the rivers at that time established. As\r\nthe land was baseleveled and the velocity of the streams decreased,\r\nthey lost in large degree their cutting power and sluggishly meandered\r\nmore or less in broad flood-plains. During and for a period after the\r\nuplift, their cutting power was restored to them by virtue of their\r\nincreased velocity and they excavated the deep narrow valleys which we\r\nfind in the crystalline highlands. The upper course of the Housatonic\r\nis a good example of a river re-adjusted to the structure during one\r\ncycle, revived by uplift to a second cycle of erosion, and in places\r\n“conformably superimposed” upon structures from which it would have\r\nbeen led away in the ordinary course of re-adjustment. Its tributaries,\r\nthe East Aspetuck, Still, Shepaug, and Pomeraug follow courses\r\nre-adjusted in one cycle and revived in a later uplift.\r\n\r\nWe can assert with the more confidence that such was the history of\r\nthe upper Housatonic, because we find in other states, in regions\r\nwhose history has been the same, similar examples of “conformably\r\nsuperimposed” and “revived” streams. The Musconetcong and Pequest,\r\nhighland rivers of New Jersey, are streams “revived” from mature old\r\nage to vigorous youth and “conformably superimposed” upon saddles of\r\ngneiss between two limestone valleys.[44]\r\n\r\n_Unconformable rivers._ In considering the course of the lower\r\nHousatonic we meet with some difficulty at the outset. In the southern\r\npart of the town of New Milford the river leaves the limestone belt\r\nwhich continues with some slight interruptions to the Hudson, and\r\nswings sharply into the crystalline plateau in a southeasterly course\r\nuntil it is joined by the Naugatuck, when their united waters flow\r\nsouth for a few miles to the sound. The course of the lower Connecticut\r\nis even more surprising. At Middletown it leaves the broad open\r\nTriassic sandstone lowland, and through a gorge enters the plateau,\r\nwhich has an average elevation of 600 to 700 feet. In this plateau of\r\ncrystallines the river has sunk its valley nearly to sea-level. The\r\nslopes are steep compared to the lines in the sandstone lowland, and\r\nthe contrast between the two parts of the river is one of the striking\r\nfeatures of Connecticut scenery. Several theories may be framed to\r\naccount for the curious behavior of these two rivers, but none of them\r\nare free from all difficulty.\r\n\r\n_As a consequent river._ The lower Connecticut has been thought[45] to\r\nbe a revived river, whose course was consequent upon the post-Triassic\r\ntilting and faulting. The faulted monocline seems to have had the shape\r\nof a half-boat, ends to the north and south, and one gunwale rising\r\ntoward the west, the combined effect of the tilting and faulting being\r\nto swing the river to the southeast, where the keel of the boat was\r\nlowest. The probable existence of faults, with upthrow on the east,\r\nalong the eastern margin of the Triassic rocks, is a difficulty in the\r\nway of the complete acceptance of this theory. Unfortunately too little\r\nis known about the structure of the western plateau to say whether\r\nthe course of the lower Housatonic could be accounted for on such an\r\nhypothesis. On this theory the Connecticut would be consequent upon the\r\nJurassic deformation, and revived by the post-Cretaceous uplift.\r\n\r\nIt may be suggested that the southeast courses are due to the tilting\r\nof the peneplain at the time of elevation, the plateau now being, as\r\nwe have seen, much higher in the northwestern part of the state than\r\nelsewhere. But the acceptance of this theory necessitates a degree of\r\nsmoothness and absence of even mild relief in the peneplain, which is\r\nhardly possible. The present average slope of the plateau is but a\r\nfew feet per mile, and it seems incredible that so gentle a tilting\r\ncould force rivers as large as these to take new courses. Besides,\r\nif the Housatonic and Connecticut were deflected, why were not the\r\nsmaller streams--the Naugatuck and Quinnebaug--also given southeastern\r\ndeflections? Clearly, this explanation is not the correct one.\r\n\r\n_Superimposition._ It has been suggested that these courses may be\r\ninherited from a Cretaceous cover, which formerly stretched over\r\nConnecticut for a considerable distance, but of which no traces now\r\nremain in the state. On parts of Long Island the Cretaceous deposits\r\nare found, and it is not inherently impossible nor improbable that they\r\nonce stretched far over the main land. In New Jersey[46] several lines\r\nof evidence seem to show that the Cretaceous beds formerly extended\r\nacross the Triassic, probably to the margin of the highland plateau.\r\nThe curious drainage of the Watchung Crescent is one evidence of this,\r\nbut the other proofs are along entirely different lines, so that\r\nthere is apparently good evidence that the Cretaceous beds extended\r\ntwenty-five miles or more farther inland. If, in the time which has\r\nelapsed since the deposition of these beds, there has been erosion\r\nsufficient to strip them off from such a broad area in New Jersey, may\r\nthey not, in Connecticut, under presumably similar conditions, have\r\nbeen equally eroded?\r\n\r\nThere is much which makes this hypothesis attractive, and, as the\r\nfacts were first studied, it seemed the most likely one. It affords\r\na good explanation, not only for the courses of the Housatonic and\r\nConnecticut, but also for other rivers along the sound. It seems, also,\r\nat first thought, to be well supported by analogy from New Jersey.\r\nBut a closer study of the situation in that state reveals marked\r\ndifferences in the attendant circumstances. There the soft Triassic\r\nsandstone must have been worn down to a lowland early in the Cretaceous\r\ncycle, perhaps by the close of Jurassic time or thereabouts, while the\r\nharder crystallines retained a strong relief. The slight subsidence,\r\nwhich marked the beginning of marine Cretaceous in New Jersey, allowed\r\nthe Cretaceous sea to transgress rapidly the baseleveled sandstones to\r\nthe foot of the crystalline hills, but not to cover them to any extent.\r\nIt is not probable that the crystallines in Connecticut had been\r\nbrought nearer to baselevel than those in New Jersey at the time of the\r\nCretaceous deposits. There is no evidence to show that the subsidence\r\nwas greater in Connecticut than in New Jersey, and, therefore, from _a\r\npriori_ considerations, the conclusion would seem to follow that the\r\nsubsidence, which permitted the Cretaceous sea to cover the Triassic\r\nsandstone area of New Jersey, was not sufficient to permit the sea to\r\ncover the then unsubdued crystalline hills of Connecticut. Although\r\nthis hypothesis is not to be hastily thrown aside, for theoretical\r\nreasons, yet it would seem necessary to hold it very lightly, at\r\nleast until some positive proof is found of the former existence of\r\nthe Cretaceous or some later formation in that region. The first\r\nsuggestion, that the lower Connecticut was a consequent river in the\r\nCretaceous cycle and was revived by the post-Cretaceous uplift, is, at\r\nthe present state of knowledge, the most probable.\r\n\r\n_The Farmington._ The roundabout course of this river presents another\r\ninteresting problem, which is not free from difficulties. From its\r\nsource in Massachusetts it flows southeast across the crystallines\r\nto the village from which it takes its name, where it turns abruptly\r\nnorth along the Triassic sandstones for ten or twelve miles, when with\r\nanother wide sweep it crosses the trap ridges at Tariffville by a deep\r\ngorge, and resumes its southeasterly course to the Connecticut. Of this\r\nlatter part I will speak later, but now arise the questions, “what\r\nhas been the history of this river,” and “why does it turn north at\r\nFarmington?”\r\n\r\n_The Farmington in the Tertiary cycle._ A course more accordant with\r\nthe structure would seem to be south along the Quinnipiac and Mill\r\nriver valleys to the sound at New Haven. As has been said before\r\n(page 376), Prof. Dana has expressed the opinion that the gorge at\r\nTariffville was occupied by the Farmington in Tertiary times, and that\r\nthe Westfield river gap further north and the gorge of the Quinnipiac\r\nsouthwest of Meriden are also of earlier date than the glacial epoch.\r\nOne reason has also been given why I differ from him in regard to\r\nthe Quinnipiac and Tariffville gorges--they are narrower and steeper\r\nthan those made in similar rocks during the Tertiary cycle. But more\r\nthan this, the constructional topography, resulting from the tilting\r\nand faulting of the region, could not, it would seem, have caused\r\nthe Farmington to take its present course. Even if it had taken\r\nthis roundabout course during the baseleveling of the country, it\r\nmust, since it would have had to cross three trap sheets, have been\r\ncaptured and led to the sea by the shorter and easier way along the\r\nsandstone area. The fact that the Connecticut probably persisted in\r\nits consequent course is no argument for similar conditions for the\r\nFarmington, because the latter is much the smaller stream, and so more\r\neasily captured. Nor could the river have been forced into this course\r\nduring or after the post-Cretaceous uplift, for the land was then\r\nraised more at the north than at the south, and any changes from this\r\ncause would have been to confirm the river in its southward course. It\r\nis very probable, therefore, that in at least the latter part of the\r\nTertiary cycle, the Farmington did not have its present course, but\r\nfollowed the open sandstone valley, along the course of the Quinnipiac\r\nand Mill rivers of to-day. The earlier history of this river is purely\r\nconjectural; one fact may shed a little light upon it, a fact which may\r\nindicate that this course was an adjusted one taken during Tertiary\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n_In pre-Tertiary times. Origin of Cook’s Gap._ A few miles southeast\r\nof where the river emerges from the crystallines, the trap ridge is\r\ncut by a deep wind notch--Cook’s Gap--through which the New York and\r\nNew England Railroad passes west from New Britain. As was pointed out\r\nsome time ago by Prof. Davis,[47] this is not a fault gap, because the\r\nalignment of the ridge is not broken, but it is probably an abandoned\r\nwater gap, the head-waters of the stream which formerly occupied it\r\nhaving been abstracted by a rival, which did not have to cross a\r\nhard trap ridge. Perhaps this river was the ancestor of the present\r\nFarmington, and in that case its history would seem to have been\r\nas follows. A stream consequent upon the constructional topography\r\nafter the faulting and tilting at the close of the Triassic, it had\r\nits upper course on the crystallines, its lower on the sandstones\r\nand buried trap sheets. In its old age it crossed by a shallow gap\r\nthe trap sheet, which had been uncovered by erosion. In the second\r\nor Tertiary cycle it was simply a revived stream quickened to a new\r\nlife by the post-Cretaceous uplift of the peneplain. This uplift gave\r\nopportunity to a rival stream, which did not have to cross the hard\r\ntrap beds to intercept the waters of the old Farmington, and lead them\r\nout by a shorter, easier path, probably down the sandstone valley west\r\nof the trap ridge. The path across the trap was abandoned, and the\r\nnotch became a wind gap; the river following its new course, until the\r\nincursion of the ice-sheet interrupted its normal development. This is\r\nof course almost entirely speculative. Cook’s Gap is best explained as\r\nan abandoned river gap; the Farmington is the nearest river of a size\r\nproportional to the size of the gap, and the hypothesis is a rational\r\none. There is, however, no direct evidence that the Farmington once\r\noccupied Cook’s Gap.\r\n\r\n_The Tariffville cut._ Before attempting to answer the second question,\r\n“why the river flows north at Farmington?” let us consider for a moment\r\nthe history of the Tariffville cut. The river occupies a gorge whose\r\nsides are steep and talus covered, but which is not at all clogged with\r\ndrift. There is naturally no room at or near the water level, even for\r\nthe wagon road, place for which has been blasted near the top of the\r\ngorge. The profile of the gap shows a gentle ascent from the top of the\r\ngorge, up to the nearly level crest line of the ridge. That is to say,\r\nthe recent gorge has been cut in the bottom of a sag in the ridge. We\r\nhave already given our reasons for believing that the gorge here is\r\nmuch younger than the Westfield river gap; that it is a part of the\r\nwork of the next cycle; that it is post-Tertiary. The sag, however, in\r\nthe bottom of which the gorge is cut, is clearly of the earlier cycle.\r\nThe bottom of the sag is much above the level to which the rivers had\r\ncut their valleys in the late Tertiary, and, therefore, it is certain\r\nthat a river could not have occupied it at the close of that cycle.\r\nIt was probably an abandoned water-gap whose stream had been captured\r\nin the same way and in the same cycle as the river, which formerly\r\noccupied Cook’s Gap.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the sag and gorge, although located very near a fault\r\nline, do not correspond to it, but are transverse and independent of\r\nit, is instructive and needs a moment’s attention. It seems probable\r\nthat the stream consequent upon the faulted blocks would have flowed\r\ndown the slope of the tilted block and then along the fault line at\r\nthe foot of the fault cliff and would have held this course during\r\nthe baseleveling of the country. When the area was baseleveled\r\nthe stream must have swung from side to side in its broad flood\r\nplain, and thus departed from the fault line. When it was revived\r\nby the post-Cretaceous uplift, it was confined to the course it had\r\nunwittingly taken on the sandstones just above the hard ridge, and\r\nit was forced to cut down through the trap. Subsequently a rival,\r\nwhich did not have to work against this obstacle, abstracted its head\r\nwaters and the gap was abandoned. The accompanying diagrams may make\r\nthis easier to understand. Figure 3 is a cross-section of the faulted\r\nmonocline, R showing the position of the river along the foot of the\r\nfault cliff. The line B L represents the surface of the country after\r\nbaseleveling, the trap outcrops forming _low_ hills (much exaggerated\r\nin the diagram). Figure 4 shows the dislocated trap sheets, the fault\r\nline and the winding course of the river, which has abandoned the\r\nfault line except where it passes between the low trap hills. Here\r\nthe country is at baselevel. Figure 5 represents the region after the\r\nelevation and resulting erosion. The trap ridges have become more\r\npronounced, and have migrated eastward in the direction of the dip. The\r\nriver has been slowly let down upon the northern one from the sandstone\r\nat point G and has there cut into the solid trap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURES 3–5.]\r\n\r\nThe transverse notch of Cook’s Gap, already described, was probably\r\nlocated in a somewhat similar manner, but the case is not so clear as\r\nat Tariffville.\r\n\r\n_Gravel terraces of the Farmington._ A consideration of some facts\r\nconcerning the height and slope of the terraces along this part of the\r\nriver may give a clue to the answer to our question. One-half a mile\r\neast of Tariffville and east of the trap ridge, the highest terrace is\r\n210 to 215 feet. Half a mile south of the same place but west of the\r\nridge the height is 275 feet.[48] The top of the gorge at Tariffville\r\nis about 190 feet above the sea-level. It does not seem probable that\r\nthese highest terraces were ever continuous over all the Farmington\r\nvalley. But if they represent the level reached by the maximum flood\r\naccompanying the melting of the glacier, the great difference in their\r\nheight on the two sides of the trap ridge, in connection with the\r\nother evidence already noted, gives strong reason for believing that\r\nthe gorge as it exists to-day had not then been cut. A mile and a half\r\neast of Tariffville there is a lower terrace which is wide-spread. Its\r\ngeneral height is about 190 feet, in places a little more. In this\r\nterrace the lower part of the Farmington has cut a trench 90 to 100\r\nfeet deep. The shape of the valley makes clear the fact that before\r\nthis trench was cut the river flowed at about the 190 foot level, which\r\nis the height of the bottom of the sag at Tariffville. On the west side\r\nof the trap ridge there is also a more or less wide-spread terrace\r\nat about the same height. It seems very probable therefore that the\r\nriver was raised to the level of the old sag in the trap ridge by the\r\nbuilding of these terraces.\r\n\r\nThe present average southward slope of the highest terraces west of the\r\ntrap ridge from Northampton, Mass., to Farmington, Conn., forty-four\r\nmiles, is seven inches per mile,[49] and Professor Dana is inclined to\r\nbelieve that this is approximately the slope at the time the terraces\r\nwere built. The character of the deposits shows that the current\r\nwhich formed these deposits flowed south. The present river, flowing\r\nnorth, falls twenty feet between Farmington and Tariffville, or 1⅔\r\nfeet per mile. The reversal of the river was probably determined by\r\ntwo factors. Near the village of Farmington, the waters of 200 square\r\nmiles of territory are poured into the valley by the upper Farmington\r\nand its tributary, the Pequabuck. During the terrace building stage\r\nthe great mass of débris contributed by these streams was deposited\r\nwhere the steep gradient of the highlands was exchanged for the gentle\r\nslope of the lowland. The main north and south valley was thus choked\r\nby the débris of its tributaries and a long stretch of comparatively\r\nstill water extended north from Farmington, in which nearly horizontal\r\ndeposits were made. South of Farmington the terrace deposits are\r\nmuch coarser than to the north, and the face of the terraces is much\r\ngreater. It is not impossible that, as the deposits between Farmington\r\nand the Massachusetts state line approached nearer and nearer to\r\nhorizontality, the waters of the upper Farmington began to divide, part\r\nflowing north and part south, the northward flowing portion finding an\r\noutlet at the sag at Tariffville. If this was the case, the terraces\r\nbetween Farmington and Tariffville must have had a slight slope to the\r\nnorth. Their present southward slope could readily be accounted for by\r\nthe re-elevation of the land after the disappearance of the ice. This\r\nexplanation rests upon the ability of the upper Farmington and the\r\nPequabuck to have completely dammed the southward flowing current and\r\nturned it northward by the great mass of their deposits. If this was\r\nnot the case, and there may be some doubt on the matter, the subsidence\r\nwhich accompanied the later stages of the ice-retreat is the other\r\nfactor in the problem. It is estimated that an average depression of\r\n1.25 feet[50] through the Connecticut valley would restore it to an\r\naltitude approximating that at the close of glaciation. It seems highly\r\nprobable that these terrace-deposits were built before the maximum\r\ndepression was reached. If this was the case, the depression would be\r\nefficient in reversing the Farmington, and this factor would supplement\r\nthe first. It is impossible at present to say to what extent these two\r\nfactors enter into the problem. That they are not mutually exclusive\r\nis evident, and that they are together quantitatively competent seems\r\ncertain. Among the several hypotheses which have been considered, this\r\nseems the most probable, and in the light of the present evidence the\r\nmost rational.\r\n\r\nAt first thought it might seem that if the Farmington was reversed by\r\nthe differential subsidence of the land, the Connecticut ought to have\r\nsuffered a similar fate, and since it did not, the explanation cannot\r\napply to the Farmington. But the terraces of the Connecticut have a\r\nmuch greater southward slope than those on the smaller river, and the\r\ndepression was not sufficient to reverse the stream. The conditions on\r\nthe two sides of the trap ridge were not the same.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, the history of the Farmington seems to have been\r\nas follows: Its original consequent course was southeast on the\r\ncrystallines and perhaps across the trap ridge at Cook’s Gap, from\r\nwhich course it was turned in the Tertiary cycle by a stream whose\r\ncourse was approximately that of the Mill river of to-day. The damming\r\nof the valley by the deposits of the Upper Farmington, and the\r\ndepression in the north accompanying the ice retreat, reversed the\r\nriver at Farmington, and it took a new course on the terrace deposits,\r\nescaping by the sag in the trap at Tariffville into the Connecticut\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\n_The Quinnipiac._ The gorge of the Quinnipiac, already mentioned\r\nseveral times, seems closely comparable to the gorge of the Farmington.\r\nIt is not of the Tertiary cycle, and is best referred to the\r\ninter-glacial or post-glacial epochs. We should expect the Quinnipiac,\r\ninstead of turning eastward, to cut through this sandstone ridge, to\r\ncontinue southward along the Mill river valley. Dana[51] finds from\r\nthe heights of the terraces that the drainage of the terrace-building\r\nperiod was not along the Quinnipiac, but along the Mill river, and\r\nconcludes that the Quinnipiac gorge was obstructed by an ice-dam. I\r\nhave not as yet studied it enough in detail to do more than express the\r\nopinion here reiterated, that this gorge is later than the cycle in\r\nwhich the open sandstone lowland on either side of it was excavated.\r\nIts topographic form would put it in the cycle which has been called\r\npost-Tertiary.\r\n\r\n_The Scantic._ In the Scantic we have a typical example of a river\r\nwhose lower course is manifestly of a later date than the upper. In\r\nthis it is similar to several of our Atlantic rivers, notably those of\r\nNorth Carolina, whose upper courses are on the Piedmont crystallines,\r\nbeing probably established previous to the Cretaceous baseleveling, and\r\nwhose lower courses stretch seaward over the unconsolidated Tertiary\r\ndeposits of the coastal plain. As the plain of these recent deposits\r\nemerged from the sea, the rivers were forced to extend their courses\r\neastward over the freshly raised surface to the retreating shore\r\nline. The Scantic river has a similar history. Its upper course in\r\nsouthern Massachusetts on the crystalline plateau is a remnant of the\r\ndrainage established before Cretaceous baseleveling and revived by the\r\nsubsequent uplift. How much that revived drainage has been modified by\r\ndrift can only be determined by long field study, but the topography,\r\nas read from the topographical atlas would seem to indicate, that it\r\nhas not been much. The valleys were undoubtedly clogged with drift, and\r\nthe drainage area may be somewhat modified, but the drainage seems to\r\nbe substantially along the same lines.\r\n\r\nJust below the village of Hampden, the Scantic leaves the plateau\r\nand enters the Triassic lowland. From this point to its mouth at the\r\nConnecticut, opposite Windsor, a distance of twenty miles, it flows\r\nnearly all the way through the gravel, sand and clay deposits of the\r\nperiod of ice-retreat. The topography of the lower course of the river\r\nis entirely characteristic of a stream which has recently attacked a\r\nlevel, easily eroded district. The inter-stream surfaces are broad and\r\nflat; the descent to the stream bed which is sunk seventy or eighty\r\nfeet below the general surface is exceedingly steep. These two lines,\r\nthat of the inter-stream surface and that of the valley side, meet at\r\na sharp angle. The side streams are as yet very short, and have cut\r\nnarrow gorges down to the main river. Tributary to them are deep side\r\nravines, whose bottoms ascend rapidly to the inter-stream surface, the\r\nwhole making a dendritic system of drainage in its earlier stages. The\r\nScantic, having reached base level in its lower course, has developed a\r\nnarrow flood-plain.\r\n\r\nManifestly this part of the river valley is of much later date than\r\nthe upper part. If, during the period of ice-retreat, the lower\r\nConnecticut valley was an estuary, the Scantic was a much shorter river\r\nthan at present. Its mouth could not have been far from the point\r\nwhere now it leave the crystallines, but as the land was elevated and\r\nestuarine conditions gave place to fluviatile, the Scantic lengthened\r\n“mouthward,” consequent upon the minor inequalities of the newly made\r\nbeds. The effect would be substantially the same if the terraces\r\nwere built by great valley floods, as Dana supposes. In pre-glacial\r\ntimes this river, in common with several other rivers rising on the\r\ncrystallines and flowing into the Connecticut, had courses of various\r\nlengths over the Triassic sandstones, but these old valleys are lost\r\nentirely, the later trenches in the terrace deposits being altogether\r\nindependent of them.\r\n\r\n_Other examples._ The lower Hockanum, Farmington, Park, and the entire\r\nlength of many short streams are similar to the lower Scantic, and\r\noriginated under similar conditions. Stony Brook, a little stream\r\nnorth of Windsor Locks, presents the same features, but with this\r\nvariation: It is superimposed through a thin layer of drift upon\r\nthe sandstone, into which it has cut a deep, picturesque gorge. The\r\nHockanum and Farmington are also “locally superimposed” in a few\r\nplaces. The Connecticut, also, north of Middletown, although following\r\nits pre-glacial valley, has departed in numerous places from its former\r\nbed, and has cut down through the valley-filling onto ledges of rock\r\nbeneath. The water-power at Enfield, Conn., and at Turner’s Falls and\r\nBellows Falls, Mass., is the result of this superimposed position.\r\n\r\n_Abandoned gaps._ Many abandoned water-gaps must exist among the hills\r\nof the state. Cook’s Gap, through which the New York and New England\r\nRailroad crosses the trap ridge, three miles west of New Britain, has\r\nalready been discussed. It must not be confounded with the majority\r\nof the other gaps in the trap ridge, which are oblique, break the\r\nalignment of the ridge, and are due to faults.\r\n\r\nThe New York and New England Railroad in ascending to the eastern\r\nplateau passes through Bolton Notch, a few miles east of Manchester.\r\nThis notch, also, is an abandoned river bed but, as it seems, abandoned\r\nat a later date and for another reason than that assigned for Cook’s\r\nGap. The drift is very heavy in this region, and the most probable\r\nexplanation is that the post-glacial streams do not altogether follow\r\npre-glacial valleys. This gap, used by turnpike and railroad, testifies\r\nof another and older drainage system.\r\n\r\nThat in this brief article all the problems connected with the\r\nConnecticut rivers have been solved, or even noted, is not to be\r\nexpected. It is hoped, however, that the work done may prove a help to\r\nfurther study of the same regions, and that the tentative conclusions\r\nadvanced may be substantiated by further investigation.\r\n\r\n                    HENRY B.

Of the divisions that may be suggested the\r\nfollowing seem the most important:\r\n\r\n1. Character of the sub-morainal or hard-rock topography in the\r\nLaurentian basin.\r\n\r\n2. Origin of the basin.\r\n\r\n3. Sedimentary deposits.\r\n\r\n4. Shore markings left by former water-bodies.\r\n\r\n5. Fossils in ancient sediments, shore ridges, terraces, etc.\r\n\r\n6. Fauna of the present lakes.\r\n\r\n7. Changes in elevations of the land.\r\n\r\n8. Former outlets.\r\n\r\n9. Probable effects of an ice sheet on drainage.\r\n\r\n10. Probable effects of a subsidence which would make the basin an arm\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\n1. _Character of the hard-rock topography._ In order to learn the\r\ncharacter of the Laurentian basin it is necessary to examine the\r\nrock surface beneath the general covering of glacial débris and\r\nstratified sediments which partially fill it. To do this, those areas\r\nin which rock in place forms the surface require to be mapped and\r\ntheir elevations noted; the records of wells and other excavations\r\nwhich pass through the superficial deposits should also be obtained\r\nand the character of the underlying rock ascertained, as far as is\r\npracticable. When sufficient data of this nature shall have been\r\nrecorded, a contour map of the basin can be drawn that will reveal the\r\nshape of the depression with which the student has to deal. The depth\r\nof the present lakes plus an estimated thickness of clay and morainal\r\nmaterial covering their bottoms, will probably furnish the only means\r\nof sketching contours over the deeper portions of the basin. Even an\r\napproximately accurate map of this character cannot be constructed for\r\na long time to come, but every advance towards it will serve to make\r\nthe problems to be studied more and more definite.\r\n\r\nSomething of the form of the rock-basin is already known and several\r\ndeep channels in its borders, now filled with drift, have been\r\ndiscovered. The courses of buried channels connecting the basins of\r\nsome of the present lakes have also been approximately determined. It\r\nis not necessary at this time to refer specifically to the discoveries\r\nthat have been made, but it may be stated that enough is known to\r\nassure us that the basin is a depression in solid rock, the bottom of\r\nwhich is below sea level.\r\n\r\n2. _Origin of the basin._ The rocks in which the Laurentian basin\r\nis situated are, with the exception of the Lake Superior region,\r\nnearly horizontal and belong almost wholly to the Paleozoic. The\r\nbasin is essentially a depression in undisturbed strata, and all who\r\nhave considered its origin seem agreed that it has been formed by\r\nexcavation. A vast mass of horizontal strata has been removed, leaving\r\nan irregular rim of undisturbed rocks on all sides. The form of the\r\ndepression is now obscured by drift; the deeper portions contain\r\nstratified sediments which have been deposited within it and it has\r\nbeen warped somewhat by orographic movement.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the excavation was formed has been explained\r\nprincipally in two ways. One hypothesis is that it owes its origin to\r\na time of subaërial denudation preceding the Glacial epoch, during\r\nwhich a valley, or series of valleys, was worn out by stream erosion;\r\nand that the depression thus produced has been but slightly modified\r\nby ice action. The closing of the ancient valley has been referred\r\nto orographic movements and to the filling of its outlet by glacial\r\ndébris. Another hypothesis is to the effect that the excavation is\r\nmainly due to ice erosion during the Glacial epoch, without special\r\nreference to previous topographic relief. A warping of the earth’s\r\ncrust so as to produce a true orographic basin does not seem to require\r\nconsideration, for the same reason as already stated, that the rocks in\r\nwhich the basin lies have been but little disturbed from their original\r\nhorizontal position. Future study of the region must determine which\r\nof the two hypotheses outlined above best suits the facts; or if each\r\nhypothesis has something in its favor, what combination of the two may\r\nbe accepted as the final explanation.\r\n\r\nIt is a suggestive fact in connection with the first of these\r\nhypotheses, that the youngest rocks in the region antedating the\r\nPleistocene belong to the Carboniferous. This seems to show that the\r\nland has not been submerged since at least the close of the Paleozoic.\r\nIf not a region of sedimentation during this vast interval, it must\r\nhave been subjected to erosion. The erosion of an ancient land surface\r\nmight result in the production of topographic forms of diverse\r\ncharacter, depending on its altitude, on the length of time it was\r\nexposed to atmospheric agencies during various stages of elevation, and\r\non climatic and other conditions. The study of topographic forms is\r\nnow sufficiently advanced to enable one to predict somewhat definitely\r\nwhat features would appear under certain conditions. We also know the\r\ncharacteristics of topographic forms due to glacial erosion. It seems\r\nevident, therefore, that a knowledge of the hard-rock topography in\r\nthe Laurentian basin, would enable one to draw definite conclusions in\r\nreference to the part that ice and water each had in shaping the forms\r\nnow found there.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion that the region under consideration has been glaciated\r\nis well established; it remains, therefore, to determine what\r\ntopographic forms, if any, due to pre-glacial stream erosion can be\r\nrecognized. As an example of this kind of evidence desired, attention\r\nmay be directed to the northward facing rock escarpments which follow\r\nthe southern shores of lakes Erie and Ontario for a large part of their\r\ncourses and at varying distances up to several miles. These escarpments\r\nare composed of the edges of nearly horizontal strata, mostly of\r\nPaleozoic limestone, and their bases are buried beneath glacial débris\r\nand stratified clays so deeply that in some instances, at least, they\r\ndo not reveal half of their actual height. These escarpments not only\r\nhave Pleistocene deposits banked against them, but their faces and\r\nsummits are polished and grooved, showing how stubbornly they resisted\r\nthe invasion of the ice which impinged against them from the north.\r\nSouth of lake Ontario especially, the trend of the escarpment referred\r\nto is directly athwart the course of the ancient glaciers. The entire\r\nhistory of these escarpments cannot be discussed here, as my desire\r\nis simply to call attention to the fact that they existed before the\r\nGlacial epoch, and are relics of a strongly accented pre-glacial\r\ntopography. They are within the southern border of the Laurentian\r\nbasin, and hence afford means of determining, in part, what was the\r\nform of that basin before it was modified by ice action. Other similar\r\nescarpments exist in the northern and western portions of the same\r\ngreat basin, and as this study progresses it is to be expected that\r\nstill other features of the pre-glacial land will be revealed. It is\r\nperhaps too early to decide what were the special topographic forms\r\nwhich gave character and expression to the St. Lawrence basin before\r\nthe ice invasion, but the Erie and Ontario escarpments and some other\r\nsimilar features now recognized, suggest that in Tertiary times it\r\nresembled the present condition of the upper portion of the Mississippi\r\nvalley, where bold, rock escarpments border wide stream-worn\r\ndepressions.\r\n\r\nDeep drift-filled channels are known to cut across the Erie and Ontario\r\nescarpments. These seem to have been formed by streams tributary\r\nto the main drainage line to the north. If this conclusion is well\r\nfounded, a study of the hard-rock topography should reveal other\r\nsimilar channels and finally indicate a well matured drainage system.\r\nIf even the broader and stronger features of the pre-glacial surface\r\ncan be determined, then the modifications due to glacial abrasion will\r\nbecome conspicuous, and the amount that glaciers have broadened and\r\ndeepened the basin be determinable.\r\n\r\nA study of the lithological character of the drift south of the present\r\nlakes should show, at least in a rough way, what portion of it was\r\nderived from the waste of rocks within the Laurentian basin. This\r\ninquiry has already been undertaken by at least two geologists, and\r\nestimates of the quantity of material removed from the basins of lakes\r\nMichigan and Erie respectively, have been made. This method may be\r\nextended so as to embrace a larger area, or some special portion of\r\nthe great depression best suited for the trial may be selected. If the\r\nmaterial removed from the basin or re-distributed within it by glacial\r\naction can be shown to be approximately equivalent in volume to the\r\namount of rock excavated in order to form the depression, it would\r\nevidently tend to support the hypothesis of glacial erosion. If, on\r\nthe contrary, the amount of débris derived from the basin should fall\r\nfar short of what would be requisite to refill it, no very definite\r\nconclusion would seem to be indicated unless account could also be\r\ntaken of the fine material carried away by glacial streams.\r\n\r\nAs the case stands at present it appears that there is evidence of a\r\npre-glacial valley or series of valleys as has been claimed by several\r\ngeologists, and that all but the boldest features of the old topography\r\nhave been obliterated or greatly modified by glacial erosion followed\r\nby glacial and other sedimentation. Additional observations should\r\nshow somewhat definitely the amount of work assignable to particular\r\nportions of the history. How far the results of subaërial and of\r\nglacial erosion have been modified by other agencies, more especially\r\nby orographic movements, has also to be considered.\r\n\r\nIf the St. Lawrence basin shall be shown to be largely the result of\r\nsubaërial erosion it will follow, unless it is found that the deeper\r\nportions are the result of glacial action, that the land at the time\r\nthe streams did their work, must have stood higher than at present, for\r\nthe reason that the bottom of the depression is now below sea level.\r\nSome idea of the smallest amount of elevation necessitated by this\r\nhypothesis might be obtained by estimating the gradients of the ancient\r\nstreams and the amount of elevation required to bring the bottom of the\r\ndepression up to sea level.\r\n\r\nA study of the hard-rock topography in the valleys of the Ottawa and\r\nSt. Lawrence and of the present submerged Atlantic border of the\r\ncontinent would also be instructive in this connection. The strict\r\ncorrelation of the topographic history of the interior and of the\r\ncontinent’s margin may be difficult, but as the two regions are\r\ndirectly connected, valuable results should follow their comparative\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis that the Laurentian basin is due largely to pre-glacial\r\nerosion, necessitates also that the ancient system of river valleys\r\nshould have been closed in some way so as to form the basins of the\r\npresent and of former lakes. The closing has been referred to several\r\nagencies. An unequal subsidence following the period of stream erosion\r\nhas been postulated. During the Glacial epoch the entire region was\r\nice-covered and only glacial streams of one kind or another could\r\nhave existed. On the retreat of the ice, when portions of the basin\r\nwere abandoned, the drainage is supposed to have been obstructed by\r\nthe ice itself, as will be noticed below. When the glaciers melted,\r\na vast sheet of débris was left which in many instances filled or\r\nobstructed previous drainage lines. Old channels, now deeply buried,\r\nhave been reported to connect the basins of the various existing lakes,\r\nas has already been mentioned, but no similar channel which could\r\nhave afforded an escape for the waters of the entire basin has been\r\ndiscovered. Here again an acquaintance with the hard-rock topography\r\nshould give assistance and indicate either that such a channel existed\r\nor that orographic movements have taken place which have obstructed the\r\nformer drainage system. The glacial hypothesis assumes that the basin\r\nwas excavated mainly by glacial abrasion and does not require that\r\nthe land should be either higher or lower than at present. The study\r\nin this direction merges with that of the general glaciation of the\r\nnortheastern part of the continent, and cannot be treated at this time.\r\n\r\n3. _Sediments._--Regularly stratified deposits of clay and sand occur\r\nalong many portions of the borders of the present Laurentian lakes.\r\nThese were clearly formed in water bodies which formerly existed within\r\nthe Laurentian basin, and which in certain directions, at least, were\r\nof wider extent than the present lakes. The areas occupied by these\r\ndeposits have been partially mapped, but much remains to be done in\r\nthis direction. Fresh sections, particularly of the stratified clays,\r\nare exposed from time to time by artificial excavations, in which much\r\nof their history may be learned. Not only should records be made of the\r\nfacts noted at special excavations, but the extent and character of the\r\nstratified deposits in one area should be determined and compared with\r\nsimilar data obtained in other areas. For example: the clays covering\r\nlarge tracts on the west shore of Lake Michigan and on the southern and\r\nwestern border of Lake Superior are of a red color, while other areas\r\nbordering Lake Erie are covered with blue clay. These two deposits\r\nhave been supposed to have been laid down at the same time and in the\r\nsame lake. The definite correlation of the clays of these two areas by\r\ndirect contact, however, does not seem to have been made, and there\r\nare reasons for thinking that they may be quite distinct and that they\r\noriginated in separate lakes.\r\n\r\nThe outer limits of the deposits of clay and sand here referred to\r\nare known in some instances to be determined by ancient beaches and\r\nterraces. Such associations of deep and of shallow water deposits\r\nrequire special attention, as the study of one may assist in\r\ninterpreting the significance of the other. The fine, evenly stratified\r\nclays frequently contain large angular bowlders, which appear to have\r\nbeen dropped from floating ice and to show an intimate connection\r\nbetween the ancient lakes and neighboring glaciers. The possibility,\r\nhowever, of the bowlders having been brought into the ancient water\r\nbodies by rivers, or floated outwards from the shore by lake ice,\r\nshould also be considered. Huge angular masses of limestone have been\r\nreported as occurring in southern Michigan especially, which rest on\r\nsuperficial deposits and are thought to have been carried northward by\r\nlake ice. The relations of these masses to well defined shore lines\r\nhave never been determined. If it should be found that they are above\r\nall former shores, it is evident that they must have been carried by\r\nsome other agency than the one mentioned.\r\n\r\nA chemical examination of the clays, or of their contained water, may\r\nindicate whether or not the basin was formerly in direct communication\r\nwith the ocean. Analyses of the clays of the Champlain valley and of\r\nthe similar clays in the Ontario and Erie basins might indicate whether\r\nor not they were deposited under similar conditions.\r\n\r\n4. _Shore records._ Beaches and terraces have been studied at many\r\nlocalities about the borders of the present lakes, sometimes at a\r\ndistance of more than twenty miles from their margins and at various\r\nelevations up to several hundred feet above their surfaces. In some\r\ninstances these ancient shore records have been followed continuously\r\nfor scores of miles. The tracing and mapping of individual beaches is\r\none of the most important parts of the study here outlined, and is\r\nalready well advanced. Confusion has unfortunately arisen, however, for\r\nthe reason that topographic features, due to shore action, have, in\r\nsome instances, been confounded with somewhat similar features due to\r\nother causes. Moraines and gravel ridges, formed by glacial streams,\r\nhave been mistaken for beach ridges, and terraces of various origin\r\nhave not been clearly discriminated.\r\n\r\nIn order not to be led astray by topographic forms that simulate shore\r\nphenomena, the student should examine the shores of existing lakes and\r\nlearn what records are there being made. In the study of topography,\r\n“the present is the key to the past,” just as definitely as in any\r\nother branch of geology. The topography of lake shores has already\r\nreceived attention from one skilled in reading geological history in\r\nthe relief of the land[52] and the study of existing shores in the\r\nlight of what has already been done in that direction should enable\r\neven the beginner to avoid falling into serious error in interpreting\r\nancient records of the same nature.\r\n\r\nTo be able to discriminate clearly between shore features and somewhat\r\nsimilar glacial phenomena, it is necessary to become familiar also with\r\nthe topography of glacial deposits. Fortunately in this study also a\r\nguide is at hand[53] which, in connection with field observations,\r\nshould soon train the eye to discriminate the shapes assumed by\r\nmoraines and the deposits of glacial streams from all other topographic\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nIn examining the records of former lakes it will soon be observed that,\r\nin many instances, where the highest of a series of ancient beaches\r\nis obscure and indefinite, the topographic expression above and below\r\na certain horizon, and also the character of the surface material,\r\nwhether of the nature of lacustral clays and sands or of glacial\r\ndébris, residual clay, etc., above and below the same level, are\r\nsignificant, and enable one to map the outline of a former water body\r\nwith considerable accuracy.\r\n\r\nIn tracing ancient beaches and terraces, their forms and internal\r\nstructure need to be recorded, so that the fact of their being true\r\nshore records may be made plain to others. The elevations of various\r\nwell-defined points throughout the extent of an ancient shore should be\r\ncarefully measured, for, as will be noticed below, although originally\r\nhorizontal, they have, in many instances, been elevated or depressed,\r\nowing to broad general movements of the earth’s crust. The continuous\r\ntracing of individual shore lines for as great a distance as possible\r\nis highly desirable, especially in a wooded country, in order to be\r\npositive as to which ridge or terrace measurements of elevation relate,\r\nand also for the purpose of observing the nature of the changes that\r\noccur when a shore line gives place to other records. For example: some\r\nof the ancient beach ridges about the west end of Lake Erie have been\r\nfound to be continuations of moraines. In other instances shore ridges\r\nhave been reported to end indefinitely and to be replaced at the same\r\ngeneral horizon by glacial records of various character. The correct\r\ninterpretation of phenomena of this nature is especially important.\r\n\r\nAccurate measurements of the vertical intervals between well defined\r\nbeaches at many localities would enable one to identify special\r\nhorizons, providing orographic movements were not in progress during\r\nthe time the series was forming. This method has recently been\r\nsuccessfully applied on the north shore of Lake Superior, where the\r\ncharacter of the country does not admit of the tracing of individual\r\nterraces for considerable distances.\r\n\r\nThe deltas of tributary streams should also be revealed in the\r\ntopography of the basin of an ancient water body. Changes in the\r\ncharacter of lacustral sediments near where rivers emptied are also to\r\nbe looked for. Sand dunes are frequently an important accompaniment of\r\nexisting shores, and their association, perhaps, in a modified form,\r\nwith ancient beaches is to be expected.\r\n\r\n5. _Fossils._ Thus far only a few fossils have been found in the\r\nstratified clays and sands or in the ancient beaches of the Laurentian\r\nbasin. Such observations as have been made in this connection indicate\r\nan absence of the remains of marine life and the presence, in a few\r\ninstances, of fresh-water shells in all of the basin west of the\r\neastern border of the basin of Lake Ontario. To the eastward of Lake\r\nOntario, however, in the St. Lawrence and Champlain valleys, marine\r\nfossils are common in deposits supposed to be contemporaneous with the\r\nstratified clays to the west.\r\n\r\nA careful search in the clays and beaches left by the former water\r\nbodies might be rewarded by important discoveries. In this examination\r\nmicroscopical organisms should not be neglected. If after a detailed\r\nexamination no fossils are discovered, this negative evidence would\r\nhave its value, as it would indicate that the physical conditions were\r\nnot favorable to life, and an explanation for this fact might be found.\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to mention that care should be taken not to\r\nmistake the shells occurring in modern swamp deposits associated with\r\nthe ancient beaches for true lacustral fossils.\r\n\r\nAbout the borders of the present lakes and sometimes even below the\r\nlevel of the lowest of the ancient beaches the remains of the mastodon,\r\nelephant, giant beaver, elk, bison, deer, etc., have been found. The\r\nrecency of the existence of such of these animals as are extinct may\r\nthus be established, as well as the former distribution of those still\r\nliving in other regions.\r\n\r\nEvidence of the existence of man has been reported from one of the old\r\nlake ridges in New York, and it is important that this interesting\r\ndiscovery should be sustained by evidence from other localities. Stone\r\nimplements especially should be looked for in undisturbed lacustral\r\nclays, and in the gravels of the ancient beaches.\r\n\r\nThe remains of forests have been stated to occur in the lacustral clays\r\nadjacent to the south shore of Lake Erie. It is desirable to know\r\nthe extent of these deposits and how continuous they are; also the\r\ncharacter of the plant remains they contain, and whether they have been\r\ndisturbed from the position in which they grew. Some of the questions\r\nthat may be asked in this connection are: Was the basin drained and\r\nforest covered before the vegetable remains were buried, or were the\r\nplants floated to their present position, or did they grow on moraines\r\ncovering the stagnant border of the retreating glacier and become\r\ninvolved and buried in morainal material as the ice melted?\r\n\r\n6. _Life in the present lakes._ The fauna of the present lakes has\r\na bearing on their past history, for the reason that in the deeper\r\nparts of lakes Superior and Michigan crustaceans and fishes have been\r\nfound which are believed to be identical with marine forms. These\r\nmay be considered as “living fossils,” and are thought by some to\r\nindicate that the lakes in which they occur were formerly in direct\r\ncommunication with the ocean. If the occurrence of living marine\r\nspecies in the present lakes is found to be widely at variance with\r\nthe history of the basin as determined from physical evidence, an\r\ninquiry should be made in reference to the manner in which the species\r\ndiscovered might migrate.\r\n\r\n7. _Changes in elevation._ One of the most difficult problems in\r\nconnection with the history of an inland region is the determination of\r\nchanges of level. By leveling along an ancient beach, post-lacustral\r\nchanges in the relative elevations of various points may be readily\r\nascertained. Pre-lacustral changes, however, by which ancient valleys\r\nhave been obstructed, are much more difficult of direct observation,\r\nbut might appear from the study of the hard-rock topography, as has\r\nalready been suggested. This branch of the investigation, however,\r\nshould more properly begin at the coast and be extended inland.\r\n\r\n8. _Former outlets._ Several localities where the waters of the\r\nLaurentian basin have overflowed during former high-water stages have\r\nbeen pointed out, but some confusion has arisen in this connection,\r\nfor the reason that the channels formed by streams issuing from the\r\nmargin of the ice during the closing stages of the Glacial epoch have,\r\nin some instances, been mistaken for evidence of former lake outlets.\r\nThe old outlets which seem to have been well determined are situated at\r\ndifferent levels, and show that the entire basin could not have been\r\noccupied by a single great water-body, unless, as has been supposed\r\nby some, it was in direct communication with the sea. This hypothesis\r\nwill be considered below. It has sometimes been assumed that all of the\r\nbasin below the level of some ancient outlet was once flooded, so as to\r\nform a great lake in all of the basin now situated at a lower level;\r\nbut, in making such generalizations, the possibility of places in the\r\nrim of the basin being at a lower level than the outlet discovered,\r\nthus necessitating a special explanation, such as the partial\r\noccupation of the basin by glacial ice, or changes in elevation of such\r\na character as to raise the locality of former overflow or to depress\r\nother regions, have to be considered.\r\n\r\nFormer outlets should bear a definite relation to neighboring shore\r\nlines and to sedimentary deposits. The channels leading from former\r\npoints of discharge merit examination, as here again changes of level\r\nmay perhaps be detected in the gradients of stream terraces.\r\n\r\nMost of the ancient outlets thus far recognized lead southward, but\r\nas previously mentioned, a former channel of discharge north of Lake\r\nSuperior has recently been reported. If this observation is confirmed,\r\nit will have an important bearing on questions relating to changes of\r\nlevel and to the position of the ice front during the later stages in\r\nthe retreat of the glaciers.\r\n\r\n9. _Probable effects of a retreating ice sheet on drainage._ The\r\ngenerally accepted conclusion that glaciers advanced southward and\r\noccupied the Laurentian basin during the Glacial epoch and retreated\r\nnorthward toward the close of that epoch, is sustained by a vast body\r\nof evidence. As the ice sheet withdrew it left a superficial deposit\r\nfrequently one or two hundred feet thick over nearly all of the region\r\nit abandoned, and pre-glacial drainage lines were obstructed and mostly\r\nobliterated. As long as the slope in front of the ice was southward,\r\nthe drainage from it found ready means of escape, but when the slope\r\nwas northward towards the ice front, the drainage was obstructed and\r\nlakes were formed.\r\n\r\nWe have good reasons for believing that the topography of the\r\nLaurentian region was essentially the same at the close of the Glacial\r\nepoch as it is now, but the broader question of continental elevation\r\nis less definite. The inequalities of the surface being essentially as\r\nwe now find them, it would follow that the first lake formed when the\r\nice retreated to the north of the divide running through central Ohio\r\nand central New York, would be small and dependent on minor features\r\nin the relief of the land, and would discharge southward. As the ice\r\nretreated, the lakes would expand and become united one with another\r\nand the larger lakes thus formed would still find outlet across the\r\nsouthern rim of the basin. As the glaciers continued to retreat lower\r\nand lower, passes would become free of ice and the lakes would be\r\ndrained at lower levels, old beaches would be abandoned, the lakes\r\nwould contract, and finally separate lakes would be formed in the\r\nlowest depression in the basins of the more ancient water bodies. The\r\nshape of the retreating ice front would be determined by topographic\r\nconditions and would in turn determine the northern outline of the\r\nlakes along its margin. This in brief is one hypothesis that has been\r\nproposed to explain the varied history recorded by the shore records,\r\nsediments, etc., within the basin.\r\n\r\n10. _Communication with the sea._ Another hypothesis which assumes\r\nto account for some of the facts observed, is that the continent was\r\ndepressed at the close of the Glacial epoch sufficiently to allow the\r\nsea to have access to the Laurentian basin. This hypothesis is coupled\r\nwith others which do not recognize a period of Pleistocene glaciation,\r\nbut, as already suggested, this is a matter that is considered by the\r\ngreat body of American geologists as not being any longer open to\r\nprofitable discussion.\r\n\r\nIn the study here outlined the question whether the water bodies which\r\nformerly occupied the Laurentian basin were lakes or arms of the\r\nsea, should not be difficult of direct and positive determination.\r\nIf fossils can be found within the basin, they might yield definite\r\ntestimony, but even if they are absent or if their evidence is\r\ninconclusive, topography can be appealed to with the expectation of\r\nreceiving a conclusive decision.\r\n\r\nIf the Laurentian basin was occupied by an arm of the sea during\r\nvarious stages in the Pleistocene elevation, then the records of such\r\na submergence should occur both within and without the depression,\r\nand direct connection between the two should be expected. If the\r\nwaters within the basin were capable of making such well-defined\r\nshore records as are now found, we are justified in assuming that the\r\ntrue ocean beach on the outer slopes of the basin would be still more\r\nconspicuous. Again, the waters within the basin deposited a sheet of\r\nsediment, certainly not less than one hundred feet thick; to be sure\r\nthe conditions for rapid accumulation were there present, but if the\r\nocean covered the adjacent land it should have left similar deposits.\r\nThis is abundantly proven in the St. Lawrence and Champlain valleys,\r\nwhere clays containing marine fossils occur up to a certain horizon and\r\nrecord a Pleistocene invasion of these depressions by the sea. If the\r\nadjacent Ontario basin was occupied by the sea about the same time that\r\nthe Champlain valley received its filling of clays containing marine\r\nfossils, there is every reason to believe that the deposits and their\r\ncontained fossils in each basin would have been essentially the same.\r\n\r\nOne of the best known of the ancient shore lines about Lake Ontario has\r\nan average elevation of approximately 500 feet above the sea. If the\r\nsea had access to the basin at the time this breech was formed, then at\r\ncorresponding horizon without the basin especially, to the south and\r\nsoutheast, where the full force of the Atlantic’s waves would have been\r\nfelt, there should be still more prominent beaches.\r\n\r\nMany well-defined shore lines in the Laurentian basin are much higher\r\nthan the one just referred to, and if these were also formed during\r\nvarious stages of submergence, as has been claimed, it is evident that\r\nocean beaches and ocean sediments of Pleistocene age should be looked\r\nfor over nearly the whole of the eastern part of the United States. The\r\nstudent may easily answer this question for himself, and thus perhaps\r\nmake a contribution to the subject here treated.\r\n\r\nIn the investigation here outlined, the work of previous observers\r\nshould not be ignored, and every plausible hypothesis that has been\r\nadvanced to account for the facts observed should be carefully tested.\r\nIn writing these pages I have not quoted the writing of others, for the\r\nreason that a discussion of evidence has not been the aim in view, and\r\nalso because the writings examined are so numerous that justice could\r\nnot be done them in the space at command. That the literature relating\r\nto the subject is voluminous is indicated by the fact that an annotated\r\nbibliography of the Pleistocene history of the Laurentian basin, now in\r\npreparation, already contains over 200 entries of individual papers.\r\n\r\n                    ISRAEL C.

Preliminary to this series of meetings, Professors\r\nM. E. Wadsworth and C. R.

A carefully prepared scheme for the trip is announced,\r\nembracing visits to the leading points of interest in the Menominee,\r\nMarquette and Gogebic iron districts, and in the copper-bearing region\r\nof Keweenaw Point. Those who desire to participate in the excursion, or\r\nwho wish information regarding it, should address Professor Van Hise,\r\nat Madison.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the meetings of the Geological Society and the\r\nAmerican Association at Madison, there will be excursions to the\r\nDevil’s Lake region, to the Dells of the Wisconsin, and to the\r\ndriftless area, under the guidance of geologists personally familiar\r\nwith the features of most special interest.

ROMBERG,\r\n      _ib._, VIII., 1892, p. 275.\r\n\r\nTravelers and foreign residents in South America are rapidly furnishing\r\ninformation relative, not only to the volcanic, but also to the older\r\ncrystalline rocks composing the great Andes chain. Since the early\r\nobservations of Darwin,[54] the petrographical collections made by\r\nStelzner during his three years’ residence, as professor, at Cordova\r\n(1873–1876) have been described by himself[55] and Franke,[56] while\r\nthe results of detailed studies of the more extensive collections\r\ngathered by Stelzner’s successor, Professor L. Brackebusch, are now\r\nbeginning to appear. Professor Brackebusch’s residence in the Argentine\r\nRepublic lasted from 1876 till 1883, and during this period he made\r\nnumerous scientific expeditions.[57] The petrographical material\r\nthus obtained has been confided to specialists in Germany for study.\r\nThree papers dealing with the crystalline schists (gneisses),[58]\r\npegmatites,[59] and granites,[60] have recently appeared. The rocks of\r\nthe granite contact-zones had been placed in Professor Lessen’s hands\r\nbefore his death, while communications on other special groups are\r\ndoubtless to be expected.\r\n\r\nThese investigations naturally suffer from the forced absence of\r\nall field observations on the part of their authors, but the purely\r\npetrographical study of the material brings to light many points of\r\ninterest, while it furnishes the only sort of detailed information\r\nregarding the rocks of these remote regions which we can for the\r\npresent hope for. It is here desired only to direct attention to a few\r\nof the most striking results obtained from the Brackebusch material by\r\nthe three authors last cited.\r\n\r\nDr. Kühn’s paper on the crystalline schists treats principally of\r\ngneiss, and offers little that is new. It is mostly occupied with\r\nadditional evidence of structural and chemical changes due to dynamic\r\nmetamorphism in the sense of Lehmann. The most noteworthy of these are\r\ndevelopment and microstructure of fibrolite; production of augen-gneiss\r\nfrom porphyritic granite; development of microcline structure in\r\northoclase by pressure; secondary origin of microcline, microperthite\r\nand micropegmatite; alteration of garnet to biotite and hornblende.\r\n\r\nDr. Sabersky’s paper on the coarse-grained granites or pegmatites is\r\nentirely mineralogical, and is devoted principally to elucidating the\r\nstructure of microcline. The author concludes that the well-known\r\ngridiron structure is due, not to two twinning laws (the Albite and\r\nPericline), as has been generally supposed, but to the Albite law\r\nalone, in accordance with which the individuals form both contact and\r\npenetration twins, like the albite crystals from Roc-tourné, described\r\nby G. Rose.\r\n\r\nDr. Romberg’s paper on the Argentine granites is much more\r\nextensive than the two preceding. It is embellished by seventy-two\r\nmicrophotographs, many of which admirably illustrate the special\r\npoints described. He comes to several results of great petrographical\r\nsignificance, the most important of which relate to the origin of\r\nquartz-feldspar intergrowths in granitic rocks. He clearly shows that\r\nbeside the original granite quartz there is also much of a secondary\r\nnature present. This is not microscopically distinguishable from the\r\noriginal mineral, but its later genesis is demonstrated by many careful\r\nobservations on its relation to other constituents. The abundant\r\nsecondary quartz is regarded as the product of weathering--principally\r\nof the feldspar, into which it has a peculiar tendency to penetrate.\r\nThe extreme sensitiveness of quartz to pressure is emphasized (as\r\nit has been by Lehmann and the present writer) and illustrated by\r\nundulatory extinction, banding, granulation and even plastic bending\r\naround other minerals. Dynamic action is regarded as the efficient\r\ncause of the secondary impregnation of feldspar by quartz, and a union\r\nof this with weathering of the feldspar as the source of the abundant\r\nand complex pegmatitic intergrowths of quartz and feldspar.\r\n\r\nThese results are important, and they will now doubtless come to\r\nbe generally recognized. It is, however, of interest to observe in\r\nthis connection that all which is here announced as new in regard to\r\nsecondary and “corrosion” quartz was described and figured in even\r\ngreater detail by Prof. R. D. Irving ten years ago. This does not\r\nappear to be known to Dr. Romberg, for he does not allude to it, but\r\nanyone who will turn to pages 99 to 124 and plates XIII, XIV and XV of\r\nthe monograph on the Lake Superior Copper Rocks (vol. 5, U. S. Geol.\r\nSurvey, Washington, 1883) will find his conclusions stated in almost\r\nthe same language and with a much wider range of fact and illustration.\r\nDynamic action is not here adduced as a cause for the saturation of\r\nfeldspar by secondary micropegmatitic quartz, since the Lake Superior\r\nrocks show no evidence of having been subjected to pressure, but\r\nthat the quartz itself has been derived from the leaching of the\r\nfeldspar substance and that the impregnation is mostly confined to the\r\northoclase is clearly stated.\r\n\r\nDr. Romberg also demonstrates, in a number of cases, the secondary\r\norigin of albite, especially as microperthite, and of microcline.\r\nHe gives details relating to each of the mineral constituents, and\r\nthen the effects of pressure and of chemical action on the most\r\nimportant of them. Among many interesting observations but a few\r\ncan be even mentioned here; such, for instance, as the original\r\ncharacter of muscovite in many granites; the alteration of garnet\r\ninto muscovite; the dependence of the well-known pleochroic halos in\r\nbiotite and cordierite upon the substance of the zircon which they\r\nalmost invariably surround, and secondary rutile needles which grow\r\nout from biotite into both quartz and feldspar. In one rock occurring\r\nin a granite a violet, strongly pleochroic mineral was found, which,\r\nin neither composition nor physical properties, agreed exactly with\r\nany known species. It seems to be intermediate between andalusite\r\nand dumortierite, but, as its individuality is not yet perfectly\r\nestablished, no new name is proposed for it.\r\n\r\n                    G. H. WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _The Mineral Industry, its Statistics, Technology and Trade, in the\r\n      United States and Other Countries, from the Earliest Times to the\r\n      End of 1892._ Vol. I. Edited by RICHARD P. ROTHWELL, editor of\r\n      the _Engineering and Mining Journal_. 629 pp., 8vo.\r\n\r\nThis volume is a statistical supplement of the _Engineering and Mining\r\nJournal_, and is published by the Scientific Publishing Co., of New\r\nYork, 1893. It takes the place of the former annual statistical number\r\nof the _Engineering and Mining Journal_, and it is the first volume\r\nof a series which is to be issued annually. The object of the present\r\nvolume is to make known, as soon as possible after the expiration\r\nof the year 1892, the statistics and the various conditions of the\r\nmining industry in that year and in previous years. The future volumes\r\nwill, each year, bring these statistics up to date, and thus the full\r\nparticulars of the mining industry will be known within a few days of\r\nthe expiration of every year. The volume is a compilation of articles\r\nwritten by different authors, and the names of these writers are\r\nguarantee that the different subjects have been treated by authorities\r\nin the departments with which they deal. The editor himself, it is\r\nbut justice to him to state, has written some of the most important\r\nparts of the volume, notably the article on the statistics of gold and\r\nsilver, and his well-known familiarity with the subjects he discusses\r\nrenders the reader confident of their accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe present volume is not confined to the bare presentation of figures\r\nof production and consumption of various mineral products, but it\r\ntreats each individual branch of the mining industry in its various\r\ndepartments; and in this way the volume really represents a series of\r\ntreatises on the various mining products and the methods of treating\r\nthem. The production of each material is given not only for the United\r\nStates but also for foreign countries; the conditions of the American\r\nand foreign markets during 1892 and previous years are discussed, while\r\nthe various uses of the different materials, the history of mining in\r\ndifferent districts, the means of transportation, the metallurgical\r\nmethods of treating different ores, the methods of sampling, and the\r\npossibilities of competition in various mining industries are also\r\ndescribed. In addition to this, tables of assessments levied and\r\ndividends paid by various mining companies are given. The volume ends\r\nwith a concise statement of the statistics and condition, as well as\r\nthe extent, of the mining industries of foreign countries. Thus there\r\nis presented, in a volume of no excessive size, a complete and concise\r\nepitome of the mining industries of the world; and this work was\r\ncompleted almost immediately after the time to which it relates.\r\n\r\nThe various subjects are treated in the following order: A résumé and\r\ntables of statistics of the mineral products of the United States;\r\narticles on Aluminum, Antimony, Asbestos, Asphaltum, Barytes, Bauxite,\r\nBorax, Bromine, Cement, Chemical Industry, Chromium, Coal and Coke,\r\nCopper, Corundum and Emery, Cryolite, Feldspar, Fluorspar, Gold and\r\nSilver, Iron and Steel, Lead, Manganese, Mica, Nickel and Cobalt,\r\nOnyx, Petroleum, Phosphate Rock, Platinum Group of Metals, Plumbago,\r\nPrecious Stones, Pyrites, Quicksilver, Salt, Soda, Sulphur, Talc,\r\nTin, Whetstones and Novaculite, Zinc; Tables of Assessments Levied by\r\nMining Companies from 1887–1893; Tables of Dividends Paid by American\r\nMining Companies; Baltimore Mining Stock Market, Boston Mining Stock\r\nMarket, Denver Mining Stock Market, London Mining Stock Market, Lake\r\nSuperior Mining Stock Market, New York Mining Stock Market, Paris\r\nMining Stock Market, Pittsburg Mining Stock Market, Salt Lake City\r\nMining Stock Market in 1892, San Francisco Mining Stock Market; Foreign\r\nCountries--Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Canada, China, France, Germany,\r\nItaly, Japan, Russia, South American Countries, Spain and Cuba, Sweden,\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the subject treated in this volume can be appreciated\r\nwhen it is known that the products of the mines of the United States\r\nalone in the census year of 1889 amounted to $587,230,662, and that\r\nthis amount really only represents the interest on an immensely larger\r\ncapital invested. The mining products of the United States are far more\r\nimportant in their aggregate value than those of any other country in\r\nthe world, though, in many individual products, other countries supply\r\nmore than the United States. This country is first, however, in the\r\nproduction of pig iron and steel. It is also first in the production of\r\ncopper, gold, silver, petroleum, and a number of other products. Great\r\nBritain is still the leader in the production of coal, but the United\r\nStates’ production is rapidly growing and already equals 81.08% of the\r\nBritish production, and supplies 28.75% of the world’s consumption.\r\n\r\nEvery subject in this volume is fully discussed, and at the same time\r\nnothing is given which is not appropriate and even necessary. Thus\r\na combination of completeness and conciseness is reached which is\r\nexcellent. Among the most carefully and exhaustively treated subjects\r\nare copper, gold and silver, the platinum group of metals and coal\r\nand iron, though many others might be mentioned, for every subject\r\nundertaken has been thoroughly treated. In the article on copper the\r\nstatistics of production and consumption, as well as the condition\r\nof the various domestic and foreign markets, are fully discussed by\r\nthe editor, and, in addition, separate articles are also given on\r\n“American Methods of Ore Sampling and Assaying,” by Albert R. Ledoux,\r\nand on “Bessemerizing Copper Matte,” by Charles Wade Stickney. The\r\narticle on the statistics of gold and silver is by Mr. R. P. Rothwell,\r\neditor of the volume, and is an excellent piece of statistical work,\r\ngiving, as it does, the statistics of production of gold and silver\r\nin the world for a number of years back. To this article are appended\r\ninteresting papers on the “Chronology of the Gold and Silver Industry,\r\n1492–1892,” by Walker Renton Ingalls, on “Recent Improvements in Gold\r\nChlorination,” by John E. Rothwell, and on the “Cyanide Process,” by\r\nLouis Janin, Jr.\r\n\r\nThe article on the Platinum Group of Metals, by Charles Bullman, gives\r\ncomplete information regarding the production, consumption, nature of\r\nthe deposits, metallurgy and uses of platinum and its related metals,\r\niridium, rhodium, osmium, palladium and ruthenium. The articles on\r\nCoal and Coke and on Iron and Steel, both by Mr. Wm. B. Phillips, give\r\nfull statistics of production and consumption, as well as interesting\r\nhistorical data, and reports of the condition of various markets. Many\r\nof the other articles in this volume deserve mention, but lack of\r\nspace forbids further detail. It may be said, however, that everything\r\nnecessary is presented, and nothing unnecessary or unreliable is given;\r\nin other words, the volume contains no trash.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable features of the volume is the uniform and\r\nsystematic manner in which the results are presented. The uniform\r\narrangement of statistics is a matter requiring the greatest labor\r\nand statistical ability. Compiling a single table of statistics is a\r\nsimple matter, but arranging a vast mass of statistics, relating to\r\nmany diverse subjects, on a uniform and intelligible basis, is entirely\r\nanother matter, and requires the highest skill of the statistician. In\r\nthe Mineral Industry this has been accomplished in a most successful\r\nmanner; everything is clear and intelligible at the first glance, and\r\neverything is in its proper place. A great detriment to the systematic\r\npresentation of statistics has been, as pointed out by the editor, the\r\nnecessity of using our present system of weights and measures, with\r\n“our long and short tons, our barrels of 200, 280, 300 or 400 lbs,\r\nour pounds avoirdupois and our pounds Troy, our bushels of a dozen\r\ndifferent weights, and our gallons of several incomprehensible kinds”;\r\nbut the disadvantages of this system have been partly avoided in many\r\ncases by giving the statistics in metric measures as well as in our own.\r\n\r\nThe question of the cost of production has been given especial\r\nprominence in this volume, with a view to showing the reduction in\r\nthe cost of the crude products. To use the words of the editor: “The\r\nitemization of cost is the first essential step in securing economy in\r\nproducing any article, and the history of every country and of every\r\nindustry has shown that prosperity, whether national, industrial, or\r\nindividual, is, in a general way, inversely proportional to the cost\r\nof supplying the rest of the world with what one produces.” These\r\nreductions are in no way dependent on the reduction of wages. On the\r\ncontrary, many of the mining industries where the greatest reduction\r\nin cost of production has been accomplished, are carried on with\r\nhigh priced labor; and in many other cases, where the wages are not\r\nhigh, the condition of the wage-earners has been greatly improved.\r\nThe reduction in cost of production has been entirely brought about\r\nby improvements in mining machinery, by a more thorough understanding\r\nof the nature of the deposits to be worked, and by more intelligent\r\nmanagement and labor. The reduction in cost of production is nowhere\r\nbetter seen than in the materials most necessary to our welfare. For\r\ninstance, coal can in some cases be carried by rail for 400 miles and\r\ndelivered on board vessels for from $2 to $2.25 per ton, and yet the\r\nmine owners and railroads make dividends; some of the manufacturing\r\nestablishments in Western Pennsylvania obtain coal at from 60 to 75\r\ncents per ton at their works; hard gold-bearing quartz can be crushed,\r\nwashed and 95 per cent. of the gold saved on the plates for $1.25\r\nper ton; high grade Bessemer iron ore can be mined, handled, shipped\r\nand delivered a thousand miles from the point of production for less\r\nthan $4.00 per ton. All these figures seem almost incredible until\r\none investigates the various devices which the ingenuity and better\r\neducation of those engaged in the industry have invented for reducing\r\nthe expenses of production.\r\n\r\nThe former annual statistical numbers of the Engineering and Mining\r\nJournal were excellent in all they undertook, but the present volume,\r\nthe Mineral Industry, makes a great advance in giving the statistics\r\nfor foreign countries in addition to those of the United States. By\r\nso doing it gives the American producers an opportunity to know the\r\npresent, past and probable future conditions of competition in foreign\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe two most important features in any statistical work are accuracy\r\nand promptness. The necessity of accuracy is self-evident, and without\r\npromptness the statistics lose much of their serviceability to those\r\nmost interested in them, for the statistics of an industry published\r\na year or two years late are rarely of much value to those engaged\r\nin that industry. The business man wants his statistics immediately\r\nafter the expiration of the time to which they relate, so that he may\r\nknow the existing condition of the industry in which he is engaged;\r\nbut if he does not get these statistics until many months or even\r\nseveral years afterwards, the condition of the industry may have\r\nchanged entirely since the time to which the statistics refer. It is\r\nthe promptness with which this volume is issued, combined with a high\r\ndegree of accuracy, far greater than would be expected in statistics so\r\nhastily compiled, that gives it its especial value.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be said, that as a piece of statistical work,\r\nrelating to an industry that is world-wide in its scope, combining\r\naccuracy with full detail and systematic arrangement, and issued so\r\nsoon after the close of the time to which it relates, the Mineral\r\nIndustry has never been equaled in this country or abroad. The former\r\nstatistical numbers of the Engineering and Mining Journal, which\r\nreferred mostly only to American mining, were considered remarkable\r\npieces of statistical work, on account of the promptness of their\r\npublication; but in the Mineral Industry we have an epitome of the\r\nmining operations of every quarter of the globe, published almost\r\nimmediately after the close of the time to which they refer, a\r\nfeat which heretofore would have been declared impossible. This\r\naccomplishment is most creditable to the editor, Mr. Rothwell, to the\r\nsystematic organization of the Scientific Publishing Co., and to the\r\nbusiness manager, Mrs. Braeunlich, by whose business ability such an\r\nexpensive undertaking is made commercially practicable. The volume will\r\nbe found of the greatest value to the economic geologist, the miner,\r\nthe engineer and the business man.\r\n\r\n                    R. A. F.

GREELY. (The National Geographic\r\n      Magazine. Vol. V., April 29, 1893, pp. 45–58 pl. 20).\r\n\r\nThe paper confines itself to the characteristic distribution of\r\nprecipitation throughout the year and gives the rainfall types of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n(a) The best defined type of rainfall within the United States is that\r\nwhich dominates the Pacific coast region as far east as western Utah.\r\nThe characteristic features are a very heavy precipitation during\r\nmidwinter, and an almost total absence of rain during the late summer.\r\n(b) The characteristics of the Mexican type, dominating Mexico, New\r\nMexico and western Texas, are a very heavy precipitation after the\r\nsummer solstice and a very dry period after the vernal equinox. August\r\nis the month of greatest rainfall, while February, March and April\r\nare almost free from precipitation. (c) The Missouri type covers the\r\ngreatest area, dominating the watersheds of the Arkansas, Missouri and\r\nupper Mississippi rivers, and of lakes Ontario and Michigan. It is\r\nmarked by a very light winter precipitation, followed in late spring\r\nand early summer by the major portion of the yearly rain, the period\r\nwhen it is most beneficial to the growing grain. (d) The Tennessee\r\ntype, prevailing in Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi and\r\nAlabama, has the highest rainfall the last of winter, while the\r\nminimum is in mid-autumn. (e) The Atlantic type, covering all the\r\ncoast save New England, is one where the distribution throughout the\r\nyear is nearly uniform, with a maximum precipitation after the summer\r\nsolstice, and a minimum during mid-autumn. (f) The St. Lawrence type\r\nis characterized by scarcity during the spring months, heavy rainfall\r\nduring the late summer and late autumn months, with a maximum during\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nThe regions lying between these several type-regions have composite\r\nrainfall types, resulting from the influence of two or more simple\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\n                    H. B. K.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _The Geographic Development of the Eastern Part of the Mississippi\r\n      Drainage System._ By LEWIS G. WESTGATE, Middletown, Conn.\r\n      (American Geologist, Vol. XI, April, 1893, 15 pp.)\r\n\r\nThe drainage of the Eastern Mississippi basin in post-carboniferous\r\nwas in all probability consequent upon the tilting which accompanied\r\nthe stronger folds of the Appalachian revolution in the east. The\r\npresent drainage is found to accord in the main with this hypothetical\r\npost-carboniferous drainage, but several streams depart quite widely\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n(a) The great drainage lines of the St. Lawrence basin are structural\r\nvalleys developed along the strike of the softer Paleozoic strata, and\r\nat right angles to the original surface. The streams seem, therefore,\r\nto have adjusted themselves to the differences in hardness and\r\nstructure of the beds discovered. (b) The Ohio and Cumberland rivers\r\ncut directly across the Tennessee and Cincinnati anticlines. The most\r\nprobable explanation is that the rivers were superimposed upon the\r\narched and eroded Silurian rocks from a thin cover of carboniferous\r\nbeds--now entirely removed. (c) The Upper Mississippi does not follow\r\nthe dip of the rocks to the southwest, but follows the strike to the\r\nsoutheast. This part of the river probably dates from the elevation of\r\nthe plains on the west and the Appalachians on the east, which marked\r\nthe close of the Cretaceous and which left a broad north and south\r\nvalley. (d) The author finds good reason to believe that the Lower\r\nMississippi, in post-carboniferous times, flowed west through Missouri\r\nand Arkansas. The present course was probably taken at the close of\r\nthe Cretaceous in consequence of elevations on the west and east, and\r\npossible depression in the south.\r\n\r\nThe Cretaceous base-level recognized by Davis on the Atlantic slope can\r\nbe traced more or less discontinuously, and remnants of it are believed\r\nto exist in Kentucky, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Arkansas. But\r\nin general the work of the Tertiary cycle has obliterated almost all\r\nevidence of it on all but the hard sandstones and conglomerates of the\r\nPaleozoic series.\r\n\r\nGood examples of the lowlands excavated from the Cretaceous base-level\r\nduring the Tertiary cycle, are the Valley of the East Tennessee and the\r\ncentral lowland of Kentucky and Tennessee. During the post-Tertiary\r\nsub-cycle the larger streams trenched to greater or less extent these\r\nlowlands. No attempt is made to carry the history of the development\r\nof the Mississippi, drainage into the complicated chapter of the\r\nice-invasion.\r\n\r\n                    H. B. K.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _On a New Order of Gigantic Fossils._ By ERWIN H. BARBOUR. (University\r\n      Studies. Published by the University of Nebraska. Vol. I, No. 4,\r\n      July, 1892, pp. 23, pl. 5).\r\n\r\nA part of Sioux County, Nebraska, lying north of the Niobrara River,\r\nhas yielded a new order of gigantic Miocene fossils unlike anything\r\nheretofore known. They are best described as fossil corkscrews, of\r\ngreat size, coiling in right-handed or left-handed curves about an\r\nactual axis or around an imaginary axis. The screws are often attached\r\nat the bottom to an immense transverse piece, rhizome, underground\r\nstem, or whatever it may be, which is sometimes three feet in diameter.\r\nIn other cases the corkscrew ends abruptly downward, as it always\r\ndoes upwards. In still other cases the transverse piece is variously\r\nmodified, and sometimes blends into the sandstone matrix, as if the\r\nunderground stem, while growing at one end, was decaying at the other.\r\nThe fossil corkscrew is invariably vertical, and the so-called rhizome\r\ninvariably curves rapidly upwards, and extends outwards an indefinite\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThat they could ever have been formed by burrowing animals, by geysers\r\nor springs, or by any mechanical means whatever, is entirely untenable.\r\nTheir organic origin is unquestionable. Microscopic sections show\r\nsmooth spindle-shaped rods, which are suggestive of sponge spicules.\r\nFrom the numbers seen in place it is evident that they flourished in\r\nthickly crowded forests of vast extent.\r\n\r\nA finely preserved rodent’s skeleton was found in one great stem.\r\nThe probable explanation is not that the rodent burrowed there, but\r\nthat its submerged skeleton became an anchorage for a living, growing\r\nDaimonelix, which eventually enveloped it.\r\n\r\nThe author proposes this provisional classification:\r\n\r\n  Order.

Scottish Geographical Magazine, April, 1890.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of Dr. Mill’s paper is to show a simple yet adequate\r\nbasis on which to build the superstructure of physical geography. It\r\ndoes not attempt a discussion of the distribution and varieties of\r\nvertical relief. The structure of the earth is stated most simply by\r\ndescribing it as an irregular stony ball, covered with an ocean and an\r\nenvelope of air. If the lithosphere were perfectly smooth and at rest,\r\nwith the hydrosphere uniformly spread over its surface, the former\r\nwould have the form of the terrestrial spheroid, and the latter would\r\nsurround it to a depth of 1.7 miles. The surface of this hypothetical\r\nspheroid Dr. Mill calls _mean sphere level_. Of course, in reality the\r\nsurface of the lithosphere is not perfectly smooth. Parts of it are\r\ngreatly depressed and parts much elevated, the latter forming the land\r\nof the earth. The writer proceeds to calculate the position of mean\r\nsphere level, and in the absence of accurate data he uses the careful\r\nestimates of Dr. John Murray, which are as follows: Average depths\r\nof oceans = 2.36 miles; average height of land = .426 miles; average\r\nthickness of hydrosphere surrounding smoothed lithosphere = 1.7 mile;\r\narea of land = 55,000,000 square miles; area of oceans = 141,700,000\r\nsquare miles. Suppose a block of 55,000,000 of square miles area and\r\n1.7 miles deep to be cut out of the smoothed lithosphere and set down\r\non the surface alongside the depression. No change will take place\r\nin the surface of the hydrosphere. If the surface of the 141,700,000\r\nsquare miles of lithosphere were reduced to uniformity, the whole\r\ndepressed area would lie .66 mile beneath mean sphere level, and\r\nthe depth of the ocean becomes 2.36 miles. To raise the land to its\r\nactual mean level above the hydrosphere surface, a sufficient quantity\r\nof matter must be removed from the depressed area and placed on the\r\nelevated block. Let _x_ = the thickness of the belt removed and _y_\r\nequal the thickness of the belt when placed on the elevated block. Then\r\n_x_ + _y_ is the height of the land above the actual hydrosphere level.\r\nFrom the data given the following equations are easily obtained:\r\n\r\n        _x_ + _y_ - .426        =  0\r\n  141.7 _x_       -   55 _y_    =  0\r\n        _x_       = .12 and _y_ = .306 in miles.\r\n\r\nThe average height of the land above mean sphere level is thus 1.7 +\r\n.306 = 2.006 miles, and the average depth of the depressed portion\r\nbeneath mean sphere level is .66 + .12 = .78 mile.\r\n\r\nDr. Mill divides the earth into the three following divisions: (1)\r\n_Abysmal area_, occupying all the depressions beneath the mean surface\r\nof the lithosphere, occupying 50 per cent. of the earth’s surface; (2)\r\n_Transitional area_, comprising all the regions above mean sphere level\r\ncovered by the hydrosphere, occupying 22 per cent. of the surface;\r\n(3) _Continental area_, all the lithosphere that projects above the\r\nhydrosphere, or 28 per cent. of the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\n                    J. A. B.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE\r\n\r\n   [61] Abstracts in this number are prepared by F. H.
